I was on the fast track once.
Employee of the month, every month. Forever.
And then they assigned me you.
I can't close the deal on a couple of pathetic flannel wearing maggots.
Everybody's laughing at me.
We're John Winchesters sons.
I've got brothers?
Adam doesn't have to be cursed.
He's a Winchester.
He's already cursed.
You're not Adam.
You've never been Adam.
You're a ghoul.
You can't kill the devil and you're losing faith in yourself, your brother.
God was your last hope.
Are you gonna do something stupid?
Like what?
Like Michael stupid.
Whatever you're thinking of doing, don't do it.
I have to.
Let me guess.
Pink-slipped?
That obvious, huh?
Takes one to know one.
"Outsourcing."
What was your crime against humanity?
Deal of the millennium.
Couldn't even get the one simple "yes" I needed.
Got to nail that bottom line, right?
Hear that.
All they care about upstairs, ain't it?
Results, results, results.
They don't know.
They're not down on the ground, in the mud,
Nose to nose with all you pig-filthy humans.
Am I right?
Absolutely... filthy what?
I mean, whatever happened to personal loyalty?
How long have I worked for these guys?
Five millennia? Six?
Seems like it, don't it?
Damn straight, it does.
Two more.
Zach.
Stuart.
What are you gonna do next, Stuart?
Hell, I don't know.
Maybe something to do with the Internet.
Yeah?
Whoa.
Earthquake?
No.
My boss.
Ah!
Aah!
Aaah!
Go ahead... get it over with.
I'm ready.
Wait
What?
Yes! Anything, of course.
Just... just put me back in.
You won't regret it.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Ah.
Back in business, boys!
"Oh when the saints go marching in"
"Oh when the saints..."
  Season 5 Episode 18
  "Point of No Return"
Sending someone a candy-gram?
How'd you find me?
You're gonna kill yourself, right?
It's not too hard to figure out the stops on the farewell tour.
How's Lisa doing, anyways?
I'm not gonna kill myself.
No?
So, Michael's not about to make you his Muppet?
What the hell, man?
This is how it ends?
You just... walk out?
Yeah, I guess.
How could you do that?
How could I?
All you've ever done is run away!
And I was wrong every single time I did.
Just... please... not now.
Bobby is working on something.
Oh, really... what?
You got nothing, and you know it.
You know I have to stop you.
Yeah, well, you can try.
But just remember, you're not all hopped up on demon blood this time.
Yeah, I know... but I brought help.
Yeah, no, this is good, really.
Eight months of turned pages and screwed pooches, but tonight... tonight's when the magic happens.
You ain't helping.
Yeah, well, why don't you let me get out of your hair, then?
What the hell happened to you?
Reality happened.
Nuclear's the only option we have left.
Michael can ice the devil, save a boatload of people.
But not all of them.
We got to think of something else.
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.
But if Lucifer burns this mother down and I could have done something about it, guess what... that's on me.
You can't give up, son.
You're not my father.
And you ain't in my shoes.
What is that?
That's the round I mean to put through my skull.
Every morning,
I look at it, and I think...
"maybe today's the day
I flip the lights out."
But I don't do it.
I never do it.
You know why?
Because I promised you
I wouldn't give up!
Cass, you okay?
No.
What's wrong?
Somethings happening.
Where?
I'm gonna get a beer.
Do you mind?
Help.
Boys!
Who is it?
That's our brother.
Wait a minute.
Your brother... Adam?
Cass, what the hell?
Angels.
Angels... why?
I know one thing for sure.
We need to hide him now.
- Where am I?
- It's okay.
Just relax.
You're safe.
Who the hell are you?
You're gonna find this a little... a lot crazy, but we're actually your brothers.
It's the truth.
John Winchesters our father, too.
See, I'm Sam.
Yeah, and I'm sure that's Dean.
I know who you are.
- How?
- They warned me about you.
- Who did?
- The angels.
Now, where the hell is Zachariah?!
So, why don't you just tell us everything?
Start from the beginning.
Well, I was dead and in heaven... except it... it, uh, kind of looked like my prom.
And I was making out with this girl.
Her... her name was Kristin McGee.
Yeah, that sounds like heaven.
Did you get to third base?
Just, uh... just keep going.
Well, these... these angels, they popped out of nowhere, and they tell me that I-I'm chosen.
For what?
To save the world.
How you gonna do that?
Oh, me and some archangel are gonna kill the devil.
What archangel?
Michael.
I'm his, uh, sword or vessel or something.
I don't know
Well, that's insane.
Not necessarily.
How do you mean?
Maybe they're moving on from you, Dean.
Well, that doesn't make sense.
He's John Winchesters bloodline,
Sam's brother.
It's not perfect, but it's possible.
You got to be kidding me.
Why would they do this?
Maybe they're desperate.
Maybe they've wrongly assumed
Dean would be brave enough to withstand them.
All right, you know what?
Blow me, Cass.
Look. No way.
After everything that's happened.
All that crap about destiny, suddenly the angels have a plan "B"?
Does that smell right to anybody?
You know, this has been a really moving family reunion, but, uh,
I got a thing, so...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Sit down.
Just listen, okay?
Please.
It's unbelievable.
Now, Adam...
The angels are lying to you.
They're full of crap.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Really? why not?
Um, 'cause they're angels.
They tell you they were gonna roast half the planet?
They said the fight might get pretty hairy, but it is the devil, right?
So, we got to stop him.
Yeah, but there's another way.
Great. What is it?
Well, we're working on the power of love.
- How's that going?
- Not good.
Look, Adam... you don't know me from a hole in the wall, I know... but I'm begging you.
Please, just trust me.
Give me some time.
Give me one good reason.
Because we're blood.
You got no right to say that to me.
You're still John's boy.
No, John Winchester was some guy who took me to a baseball game once a year.
I don't have a dad.
So, we may be blood, but we are not family.
My mom is my family... and if I do my job,
I get to see her again.
So, no offense, but she's the one I give a rat's ass about, not you.
Fair enough.
But if you have one good memory of dad... just one... then you'll give us a little more time.
Please.
Going somewhere?
Out for a... beer.
Great, we got beer.
Have a seat.
Great.
You know, you pitch this whole dewy-eyed romance thing... but the truth is,
I'm on lock-down, aren't I?
Adam... you may not believe it, but dad was trying to protect you... keeping you from all this.
Yeah, well, I guess the monster that ate me didn't get that memo.
You remember that?
Oh, yeah.
Still, trust me.
The one thing worse than seeing dad once a year... was seeing him all year.
Do you know how full of crap you are?
- What?
- Really.
You see, it was me and it was my mom, that's it.
She worked the graveyard shift at the hospital.
I cooked my own dinners,
I put myself to bed.
So, you can say whatever you want about our dad, but the truth is,
I would have taken anything.
All right?
Look, if we had known we had a brother...
Well, you didn't, so...
We would have found you.
Look, I can't change the past.
I wish I could.
But from here on out...
What... we gonna hop in the family truckster?
Pop on down to Wally world?
Tell you one thing... attitude like that, you'd fit right in around here.
Well, Cass, not for nothing... but the last person who looked at me like that...
I got laid.
Uh, why don't you, uh, go keep an eye on Adam?
Is this really necessary?
Well I mean, we got our hands full, Dean... a houseful of flight risks.
I'm not letting him do it.
- Who, Adam?
- No, I'm... I'm not, either.
No, you're not getting me.
Oh, no, no,
I "get" you perfectly.
But I'm not letting you do it either.
That kid's not taking a bullet for me.
- Dean...
- I'm serious.
I mean, think about how many people we've gotten killed, Sam.
Mom, dad...
Jess, Jo, Ellen... should I keep going?
It's not like we pulled the trigger.
We might as well have.
I'm tired, man.
I'm tired of fighting who I'm supposed to be.
Well, do you think maybe you could take a half a second and stop trying to sacrifice yourself for a change?
Maybe we could actually stick together?
I don't think so.
Why not?
Dean, seriously.
Tell me... I-I want to know.
I just...
I-I don't believe.
In what?
In you.
I mean, I don't...
I don't know whether it's gonna be demon blood or some other demon chick or what, but...
I do know they're gonna find a way to turn you.
So, you're saying
I'm not strong enough.
You're angry... you're self-righteous.
Lucifer's gonna wear you to the prom, man.
It's just a matter of time.
Don't say that to me... not you... of all people.
I don't want to... but it's the truth.
And when Satan takes you over, there's got to be somebody there to fight him, and it ain't gonna be that kid.
So, it's got to be me.
How's he doing?
How you doing?
Dean?
Dean?
Cass.
Where's Cass?
Blown to Oz.
Look, I'll get Dean.
He couldn't have gone too far.
- Just watch Adam.
- How?
You may have noticed, he's got a slight height advantage.
Then cuff him to your chair.
I don't know.
Just watch him.
Your mom's not coming, you know.
This is the park where your mom took you on her day off, right?
She's not coming... not yet.
But she will... soon.
You're Zachariah, right?
I am.
You weren't where you were supposed to be, kid.
Yeah, I know.
Can't quite zero in on you, either.
So, let me take a wild guess... you're with Sam and Dean?
Yeah.
Didn't we tell you about them?
So, you know you can't trust them, right?
You know Sam and Dean Winchester are psychotically, irrationally, erotically codependent on each other, right?
I don't know.
They said a few things about you.
Really?
Trust me, kid.
When the heat gets hot, they're not gonna give a flying crap about you.
Hell, they'd rather save each other's sweet bacon than save the planet.
They're not your family.
Understand?
Now... you want to see your mom again or not?
The end is nigh!
The apocalypse is upon us!
The angels talk to me, and they asked me to talk to you!
- The apocalypse...
- Hey!
I'm Dean Winchester.
Do you know who I am?
Dear God
I'll take that as a yes.
Listen, I need you to pray to your angel buddies and let them know that I'm here.
Our father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.
You pray too loud.
What, are you crazy?!
I rebelled for this?!
So that you could surrender to them?
Cass! Please!
I gave everything for you.
And this is what you give to me.
Do it.
Just do it!
Bobby, what do you mean,
"Adam is gone"?
Should I say it in Spanish?
He's gone how?
What the hell, Bobby?!
Watch your tone, boy
He was right in front of me, and he disappeared into thin air.
Because the angels took him.
What the hell happened to him?
Me.
What do you mean, the angels took Adam?
You branded his ribs, didn't you?
Yes. Adam must have tipped them.
- How?
- I don't know.
Maybe in a dream.
Well, where would they have taken him?
I see you and your brother share the same refined palate.
Ah.
So, uh... we ready?
For what?
What do you mean, for what? For Michael.
Oh.
Right... about that.
Look, this is never easy, but I'm afraid... we've had to terminate your position at this time.
Excuse me?
Hey, don't get me wrong, you've been a hell of a sport, really... good stuff.
But the thing is, you're not so much the "chosen one" as you are... a clammy scrap of bait.
No, but what about the stuff that you said?
I'm supposed to fight the devil.
Mm, not so much.
Hey, if it's any consolation, you happen to be the illegitimate half brother of the guy we do care about.
That's not bad, is it?
So, you lied... about everything.
We didn't lie.
We just avoided certain truths to manipulate you.
Oh, you son of a bitch.
Hey, how do you think I feel?
I'm the one that's got to put up with that dumb, slack-jawed look on your face.
Kid, we didn't have a choice.
The Winchesters got one blind spot, and it's family.
See, Sam and Dean, they're gonna put aside their differences... and they're gonna come get you- and that is gonna put Dean right... here.
Right where I need him.
This is the night, kid!
Our night.
Michael's seen it.
The tumblers finally click into place and it's all because of you.
And me. But who's keeping score?
Yeah, I'm not gonna let you do this.
Cool your jets, Corky.
Sit down.
We're doing it together.
Plus, you still get your severance.
You still get to see your mom, okay?
Why should I believe you?
You know what?
I keep hearing this.
But what I want to be hearing is this...
Yeah.
That's better.
How you feeling?
Word to the wise... don't piss off the nerd angels.
So, how's it going?
Adam's gone.
The angels have him.
Where?
The room where they took you.
You sure?
Cass did a recon.
And?
And the place is crawling with mooks... pretty much a no-shot-in-hell, hail-Mary kind of thing.
Ah, so the usual.
What are you gonna do?
For starters...
I'm bringing you with.
Excuse me?
There are too many of them.
We can't do it alone, and, uh, you're pretty much the only game in town.
Isn't that a bad idea?
Cass and Bobby think so.
I'm not so sure.
Well, they're right.
Because either it's a trap to get me there, to make me say yes... or it's not a trap and I'm gonna say yes anyway.
And I will.
I'll do it... fair warning.
No, you won't.
When push shoves, you'll make the right call.
You know, if tables were turned...
I'd let you rot in here.
Hell, I have let you rot in here.
Yeah, well...
I guess I'm not that smart.
I-I don't get it... Sam, why are you doing this?
Because... you're still my big brother.
Where the hell are we?
Van Nuys, California.
Where's the beautiful room?
In there.
The beautiful room is in an abandoned muffler factory in van Nuys, California?
Where'd you think it was?
I-I don't know... Jupiter?
A blade of grass... not van Nuys.
Tell me again why you don't just grab Adam and shazam the hell out of there?
Because there are at least five angels in there.
- So? You're fast.
- They're faster.
I'll clear them out.
You two grab the boy.
This is our only chance.
Whoa, whoa, wait. You're gonna take on five angels?
Yes.
Isn't that suicide?
Maybe it is.
But then I won't have to watch you fail.
I'm sorry, Dean.
I don't have the same faith in you that Sam does.
What the hell are you gonna do with that?
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
Adam, hey. Hey.
You came for me.
You're family.
Dean, it's a trap.
I figured.
Dean, please. Did you really think it would be that easy?
Did you?
Sam!
You know what I've learned from this experience, Dean?
Patience.
Adam?
Let him go, you son of a bitch.
I mean, I thought
I was downsized for sure, and for us, a firing... pretty damn literal.
But I should have trusted the boss man.
It's all playing out like he said...
You, me... your hemorrhaging brothers.
You're finally ready, right?
You see things our way.
You know there's no other choice.
There's never been a choice.
Stop it.
Stop it right now!
In exchange for what?
Damn it, Zachariah.
Stop it, please.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry, what was that?
Okay, yes.
The answer is yes.
Dean!
Do you hear me?
Call Michael down, you bastard!
How do I know you're not lying?
Do I look like I'm lying?
He's coming.
Of course, I have a few conditions.
What?
A few people whose safety you have to guarantee before I say yes.
Sure, fine.
Make a list.
But most of all...
Michael can't have me until he disintegrates you.
What did you say?
I said... before Michael gets one piece of this sweet ass... he has to turn you into a piece of charcoal.
You really think Michael's gonna go for that?
Who's more important to him now?
You... or me?
You listen to me.
You are nothing but a maggot inside a worm's ass.
Do you know who I am... after I deliver you to Michael?
Expendable.
Michael's not gonna kill me.
Maybe not.
But I am.
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.
Okay, come on.
Come on, move it!
No!
Dean, help!
Come on, help me.
Ah.
Dean, help!
Dean!
Hold on. We'll get you out.
Just hold on.
Adam, can you hear me?
Adam?
You think Adam's okay?
Doubt it.
Cass either.
But we'll get 'em.
So?
"So"... what?
I saw your eyes.
You were totally rockin' the "yes" back there.
So... what changed your mind?
Honestly?
The damnedest thing.
I mean, the world's ending... the walls are coming down on us... and I look over to you and all I can think about is,
"this stupid son of a bitch brought me here."
I just didn't want to let you down.
You didn't.
You almost did... but you didn't.
I owe you an apology.
No, man.
No, you don't.
Just... let me say this.
I don't know if it's being a big brother or what. But... you know, to me, you've always been this snot-nosed kid that I've had to keep on the straight and narrow.
I think we both know that that's not you anymore.
I mean, hell... if you're grown-up enough to find faith in me... the least I can do is return the favor.
So, screw destiny right in the face.
I say we take the fight to them. Do it our way.
Sounds good.

On "The vampire diaries"...
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
- The Sun and the Moon curse?
- Klaus is the real deal.
From the first generation of vampires.
The oldest vampire in the history of time
- is coming after me?
- Elijah.
- He´s one of the Originals...
- a legend.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
You and I shall draw
Klaus out together and I shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed.
- And then what?
- Then I kill him.
I come bearing gifts... this is how you kill an Original.
Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
You can't do it.
Even with the dagger and a little white out cash?
If you kill Elijah, then
I'm stuck in here forever.
As long as we keep the dagger in there,
- then he stays dead.
- Pretty much.
How did you get out?
I knew that I had begged you
not to kill Elijah, that's exactly what you'd do.
As soon as Originals die, compulsion wears off.
What did Luka tell you?
About your daughter...
You know where Klaus has her.
I want to help you get her back.
No!
He took my powers.
Stefan, we're late for school.
- Let's be later.
- Stefan, it's school.
Remember, that thing that we keep forgetting about?
- Hey!
- School?
Doesn't ring a bell.
- Stefan! Ok, 5 minutes.
- Only for 5 minutes.
Good morning, Damon.
What are you doing here?
I told you to leave.
What is your problem?
You're wearing her clothes?
Like that's going to work.
You think I'm Katherine?
Why would you think that?
Katherine's in a tomb!
Isn't she?
What the hell's going on here?
I don't know, you tell me.
Is Katherine in the tomb or not?
What are you doing?!
How could you do this?!
Stefan, you're hurting me!
Stop it, Katherine!
Stop what?
It's getting really easy being you.
- What is she doing here?
- When we killed Elijah, it broke the compulsion and freed the bitch from the tomb.
- How's that possible?
- He's an Original.
They have all sorts of special skills.
I don't want you here.
Get her out of here.
You need me, Elena.
- You all do.
- Like hell.
We all want the same thing... Klaus dead.
Yet here you all are, running around like chickens
- with their heads cut off.
- I don't need your help and I don't want it.
And that's incredibly stupid of you.
You know where Klaus is?
When he's coming, what he looks like?
If you know something, say it or get out.
Fine. Then I'll just go to the grill and have some lunch... maybe
Aunt Jenna's free for a bite.
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.
Live band?
Yeah, business has been a little slow.
The grill's trying to stay afloat.
Aren't we all?
Have you heard from Tyler?
Not a peep. You?
No, not since he stopped by the grill to talk, and I've left messages on his cell phone.
He stopped by to see you?
- What did he say?
- Not much, really.
I mean... I think to say good-bye without really saying good-bye. I just didn't know.
And that's all he said?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline.
Why? I mean, is there something you want to tell me?
Yeah! I...
I mean, no, I... it's just not that easy.
I don't get it!
Since when have I been the one that can express himself and you're one with a loss for words?
No, you're right, and I'm sorry.
You know how I feel.
So it's your move.
Just make a decision or leave me alone.
Why is she still here?
She was free.
She wants what we want...
Klaus's death.
Maybe she sees us as her only chance.
Or maybe she's trying to lure you and Damon back into her web.
- I want her gone.
- So do I.
But you're right, she's staying.
Shouldn't we at least try to figure out why?
How? All she does is lie.
Look, I hate it as much as you do, but she does make a point.
We don't know anything about Klaus. She does.
Right, but that doesn't mean
I want her shacking up with you.
Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.
Hmm, I can't.
I told Bonnie and Caroline that they could come over.
Bonnie's freaked because she lost her powers and
Caroline's having Matt drama again.
It's kind of a girls' night.
Maybe Katherine can join us.
Come on.
Mmm, burning flesh.
If you're trying to get the dagger back, you're wasting your time.
He's indestructible.
No kidding.
How do you know so much about Original vampires?
Spend 500 years running from one.
So when I told you my plan to kill Elijah, why didn't you warn me that I'd die if I used a dagger on him?
Oh, there's so many rules.
It's all very confusing.
Did you know I would die?
Did Elijah tell you his plan?
Did he have a dagger to kill Klaus with?
Why are you still here?
Because you haven't forcibly removed me.
You wouldn't.
Oh, I would.
Damon, be smart.
I want Klaus dead just as much as you do.
More.
If I wasn't be honest about helping,
I'd be long gone by now, ok?
You can hate me.
But we want the same thing.
And you know...
I always get what I want.
I wanted out of the tomb.
Didn't matter who paid the price.
Of course I knew that you'd die.
She's out of the tomb?
Yeah. We're dealing with it, all right?
Just be extra careful.
She's getting a little too good at impersonating Elena.
With Katherine still around, we gotta find a way to get your powers back.
Listen, I want to get the Martins on our side.
I want to figure out a way for us all to work together now that Elijah's out of the picture.
It's impossible.
They hate us.
It's either win them over or somebody's going to end up dead.
You think you can at least convince them to have a civil conversation?
I'll try.
Thanks. Keep me posted.
Ok. I gotta get to class.
All right, I'll see ya.
Come on.
Elena's nowhere in sight.
I'll tell her soon.
I promise.
All right.
It was bad. You know, John planted all these seeds about Isobel and now Jenna knows
I'm lying about something.
John's going to end up dead on the kitchen floor if he's not careful.
Yeah, well, easier said than done.
I gave him back his ring.
So.
Look, Jenna keeps asking about Isobel.
You know, was she murdered?
Why haven't they found the body?
I mean, how much longer can she stay in the dark?
You think we should tell her the truth?
I'm saying I can't be with her and not tell her.
It's not fair to her, and it's not the kind of relationship I want.
Not to mention it's becoming more dangerous for her not to know.
I just thought that we'd at least hold off until after we've dealt with Klaus.
You know, and even then, how do we tell someone what we know?
How does someone hear that?
Look, I'm sorry to put this on you.
But I feel it's your decision to make.
And whatever you decide to do, I'll respect it.
I want to be honest with her.
But until then,
Jenna and I are done.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't want to.
But my son made a case to hear you out.
Bonnie said that you have information about Elijah.
Elijah's dead.
I'm sorry.
Hear me out.
We can help you.
We know that Klaus has your daughter.
I'm sorry about the way
I had to get that information, but it's good that we know.
We can all work together to get her back.
How?
I suspect that you and Elijah had a plan to kill Klaus.
I'll just help you carry it out.
You can trust us. I give you my word. We all do.
- What you up to?
- None of your business.
We're pouting now?
Are those the Gilbert journals?
How am I supposed to help you if you won't tell me what you're up to?
Can you tell me where a bunch of witches were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago?
No.
- Then you can't help.
- Ugh.
If it's any consolation,
I'm glad that you're not dead.
Emily Bennett told me about the massacre.
It was a big deal in witch folklore.
When a witch dies violently, they release a mystical energy making the place of their death with power.
I think Elijah wanted to know the site of the massacre.
What was he going to do when he found it?
I don't know.
What did papa witch and baby witch have to say?
Wasn't she gone or dead? Yeah?
For the last time, I'm here to help.
Can we skip the secrets, hmm?
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
But he believed that if a witch could channel enough power...
They wouldn't need one.
Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?
We just need to find it.
But what if they can find the burial ground?
They won't. We tried,
Luka, for weeks.
We don't have a back-up plan, though, dad, and we need to be doing everything we can to save Greta.
We will save her.
But Elijah is the answer, not Stefan and his brother.
Those people, they're our enemies.
They need to be dealt with.
- You're going to kill them?
- No.
I'm going to let Elijah do it.
Chinese food or pizza?
Like you have to ask.
I will get it.
I'll do it.
Do you believe that Jonas is being sincere?
I don't know what to believe.
I think he's at a loss.
He's not sure who to trust.
Join the club.
Well, what are we going to do about this movie situation?
What about "The Notebook"?
Caroline, how many times have you seen that movie?
That is so not the point.
Well, yeah, I mean...
Hey.
What's going on?
Girls' night.
Oh.
How are you doing?
You heard about my fight with Ric.
He feels terrible.
Is this some kind of disguised attempt to cheer me up?
No. No, this is about us girls hanging out.
And, you know, we'll be here if you happen to want to talk, or...
Because I am a winner when it comes to successful relationships.
You, too?
You have no idea.
Ok, then.
It's this whole Isobel thing.
He's hiding something from me.
To play devil's advocate, maybe there is a great reason why he's not telling you.
Maybe he is just trying to protect you.
Well, that's not his call to make.
I mean, I deserve the truth. Everybody does.
Sometimes it's harder than that.
Not if it's somebody you care about, it isn't.
You know what we need?
Dancing. There is a band at the grill.
- I'm in.
- In.
In.
Are you sure about this?
I mean, I would go if I could.
No. I'm not strong enough to send you.
I can do this.
I'll stay anchored.
Use all my energy.
- If you feel weak...
- Dad.
I want this just as much as you.
Concentrate on Elijah.
Picture him in your mind.
I got it.
I'm in the Salvatore house.
Elijah's body must be there.
What do you see?
Elena and Damon.
They're reading.
Good.
If Elijah's there, you'll sense him.
Stay focused.
Can I help you?
I'm bored.
"Emily Bennett was taken by the Council today.
"They kidnapped her from her home
"and took her to the same location
"her ancestors were burned a hundred years ago."
So Emily died on the site of the massacre, too.
Does it say where?
Nope.
You know this whole friendly, cooperative thing?
Mm-hmm.
I don't buy it.
I have no reason to lie to you, Damon.
Lie.
I'm hungry.
You're the unwanted houseguest.
Go feed yourself.
Well, nothing in any of those.
Find anything?
Nope.
That's too bad.
Yeah, bummer.
Elena's fighting me.
What's wrong?
She's stronger than me.
That's because it's not Elena.
It's Katherine Pierce.
Luka... kill her.
- What?
- She's a vampire.
Find a stake and drive it through her heart.
Damon!
Katherine!
What happened?
Damon...
Luka, what's going on?
Luka! Luka!
What are you doing?!
Shutting down a crazy ass psychic witch attack!
Get over there and do something about it.
Now!
No!
Oh, my God! Luka!
Luka! I'm sorry.
Please.
Just wake up, son.
Open your eyes.
Luka!
I love my boy!
I need a drink.
Hey, Matt.
Things just got real awkward.
- Jenna.
- Not tonight, Ric.
Tonight I have traded you for señor tequila.
Yeah.
Well, señor tequila's not going to be treating you very well.
Well, the two of you have a lot in common.
Look, Jenna, I hate that you're this upset with me.
Yeah, well, it's your fault.
Because whatever it is you're keeping from me;
Whatever you think I can't handle...
You're wrong.
'Cause last year I was a grad student who smoked a lot of pot and couldn't keep a goldfish alive.
And now I'm a parent, so I think
I can handle anything, Ric.
Jenna...
He said the ball's in your court.
Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.
Why not? All you do is talk about how much you care about him.
Yeah, but I am still keeping so many secrets.
Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna.
And maybe that's our mistake.
We're trying to protect the people that we love by keeping them out of it, but in the end, we're hurting them anyway.
What are you doing?
What is she doing?
Hey, everybody.
Let's hear it for the band!
Weren't they awesome?
This isn't going to end well.
So there's this guy.
And, uh, he told me to tell him how I feel about him.
Like it's so easy.
Um, you know, just 'cause I talk a lot doesn't mean I always know what I'm actually talking about.
Ah, like now, I'm feeling loopy and I don't really know how to express myself.
I can sing.
Yeah! Yeah.
You know what, I'm going to sing.
Come on, off the stage.
You are going to let me live out my rock star fantasies, and you are going to be my back-up.
What will it be?

Matt, I...
- You killed him!
- Aah!
He's dead and I have no one.
And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like.
There you go.
What the hell?!
That's for not telling me the dagger would kill me.
Next time...
It goes in your heart.
Is that how you treat someone who... ahh...
- is trying to help you?
- You wanna help?
Start talking.
I'd love to, but you're not going to like it.
Try me.
Fine. John Gilbert and
Isobel want you and Stefan out of Elena's life.
That's old news.
Not the part where he offered me a deal.
He knew that killing Elijah would get me out of the tomb, so he gave me a choice.
Either I stay and help with Klaus, or he kills Stefan.
But he still tried to have me killed.
Right.
That was part of the deal.
I could only save one of you.
So you chose Stefan.
Of course you did.
You wanted the truth, Damon.
Would you rather I lie?
Ahh! Oh, sorry.
Sorry, Elena.
You know, I really have to get back to work.
Definitely.
I... I wouldn't.
Caroline and Matt are...
In the bathroom?!
If they're happy,
- I'm happy.
- Um, hey, speaking of happy, would it freak you out if I started dating your brother?
You're into my brother?
I know it's weird, um, but he's been so good and strong. It makes me happy.
And I really can't tell what you're thinking...
Right now.
I'm thinking that...
My brother has had more pain in his life than a hundred people's worth of pain, and...
He deserves to be with someone as amazing as you.
Really?
Really.
Oh.
Hey, Stefan, I'm at the grill.
I can't hear you.
Hold... yeah.
Where are you going?
Luka Martin's dead.
His father's going after Elena.
I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
- Wait.
I don't need your help.
I don't want it.
I know what we can do, Damon.
You have to let me do it.
Dr. Martin. You ok?
Where is she?
I don't understand.
My son is dead.
Whatever it is you think you need to do, there's a better way.
They killed Elijah and they killed Luka.
And my only shot at getting my daughter back is if I have Elena.
No. No, Dr. Martin.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I haven't seen her.
What the hell?
Mmm!
- The power's out.
- Even better.
I wish, but I should probably... whoa.
Hey!
- We have a problem.
- What's going on?
Jonas is here and he's after Elena.
Oh, my God!
We have a plan, but I need to get Elena out of here.
Well, what can I do?
- It's time to get out of here.
- I have to find Elena.
She's with Stefan, she's ok.
No one's getting out of here until I have her.
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie.
Come on. Come on.
Dr. Martin!
I'm so sorry about Luka.
I never wanted that to happen, but... at least let us help you get your daughter back.
Only Elijah can do that.
You don't need Elijah.
Caroline!
Get away from her!
Matt, no!
Matt!
Matt! No!
Matt! Matt!
Oh! Oh, my God!
Ok. Uh...
Just breath Caroline... just breath.
You have to drink.
Please, please.
Luka...
I can't believe he's dead.
After what we did to him.
No, after what he did to you.
Look, I'm sorry, I know you feel bad about all of this, but I don't.
I couldn't do anything to help.
I was useless.
I hated it.
- Thank God.
- It's not over yet.
- What's going on?
- He'll explain.
When did you guys get home?
- A few minutes ago.
- Did you check the house?
And why would we check the house?
You're welcome.
You didn't have to kill him!
Yes, we did.
Get off!
How did you guys convince her to do this?
We didn't.
It was actually her idea.
Wow. That's...
Not good.
No. No, that's not good at all.
Everything's taken care of.
I'm guessing you're going to want this back.
But your pretty little outfit is going to need a good dry clean.
You're going to have to get her out of here before Jenna gets home.
Is that all you have to say to me?
This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
I don't much like you, either, if we're going to be open.
And frankly, I'd be happy to see you dead, but if we're going to try to take on Klaus, we kinda need you to be alive.
So I'm not a threat to you, Elena.
If any of you are going to believe anything, believe that.
Thanks for getting me home.
That was kind of crazy.
Jenna, are you going to be ok?
Look,
Isobel is dead.
And there things about her death that I can't tell you;
That aren't for me to tell.
You can be upset and hate me.
I get it.
But just know that I love you.
At least I can tell you that much.
Good night, Ric.
Good night.
Hey.
You made it home.
Tonight was very weird.
Tell me about it.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be.
No, I'm serious, Bonnie.
The only witch that could given you your powers back is dead, and...I think you have a serious case of denial going, and I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what, and...
Not that denial's the worst thing.
Did you...
When he grabbed me...
He gave me my powers back.
And something else.
Jonas wants me to kill Klaus.
And did he include a how?
Yeah.
He did.
You know what I can't figure out?
What's that?
How the town knew
Emily Bennett was a witch.
I mean, because according to Johnathan Gilbert, he was the only one who knew.
I know he didn't turn her in.
Mmm, I should have figured as much.
Oh, she was a loose end.
I like mine tied up.
You know what I can't figure out?
Do I care?
Why you won't tell me where to find the site of the witch massacre.
Because I have no clue.
You knew that Emily Bennett was the key to getting me out of that tomb.
And something tells me that you did everything in your power to make sure that she was safe, yet you have no idea where she was killed.
Who's the liar now?
- You hurt me today.
- Tit for tat.
You were mean.
And very rough.
And monstrous.
You deserved it.
I like this Damon.
Katherine.
Katherine, there are six other bedrooms in this house.
Go find one.
Hi.
What the hell?
I had your face...
And all the blood.
I... I drank your blood.
You were dying.
My blood healed you.
What do you mean, it healed me?
How can your blood heal me?
Because that's what vampire blood does for humans, and that's what I am.
I'm a vampire, Matt.
No.
But it's all going to be ok, because I am going to tell you everything, and you're going to understand why I had to keep it from you, and we're going to be fine.
We'll be fine?!
Yes, because we're together and we love each other.
Vampires.
Oh, my God.
Vickie, oh, my God, at the hospital,
I thought that she was tripping out.
What?
Vickie, she knew about the vampires, and I...
What... what did you do?
Nothing. Nothing! Matt!
I need to get out of here.
No, no, no! I can't let you leave. I cannot let you leave.
What did you do to my sister?
Nothing! Nothing! I swear,
I swear, nothing, nothing!
- What did you do?!
- Nothing, Matt!!
You have to calm down! Matt!
Are John and Jeremy asleep?
I think so.
If I go to bed right now, there's a chance I'll wake up hangover-free.
Who's that?
Hi. You must be Jenna.
I'm...
Elena's mother.
Isobel.
Sync by jeska | Corrections by Alice http://www.addic7ed.com/
I wanted to say you move like an Angel.
Thank you
But it's more than that.
You give, but not too much.
Your presence on stage is like an actor on film.
Walk, just walk.
It's difficult to do.
So let's walk forwards.
Now I feel I can't walk at all!
Find your center.
London
Good morning.
Coffee, and a... a croissant?
Any in black?
Black? Yes, I have black too.
Another nice model.
I'll be right back.
It was a real pleasure.
Good dancer!
Good morning.
Lots of Faxes, huh?
Do you think people's paths cross for a reason?
It depends if you believe in chance or destiny.
What do you believe?
I believe chance gives us the opportunity to create our destiny.
How?
With our will.
A question.
You believe in God?
Good luck in Hollywood!
I'm abandoning my film.
Really, Why?
I don't like the script.
Wasn't it your idea?
I wrote a film
I wouldn't want to make.
So what will you do?
I don t know.
Something more personal.
Maybe something about tango.
I didn't notice how late it was.
Where are you?
I waited where we said.
No, I'm sure we said...
OK, fine, it doesn't matter.
Good night.
Who is it?
We should define our relationship more clearly... set some limits.
I agree.
You know, I also wanted to say something.
I've had difficult experiences before... when I mixed the professional and the personal
It's dangerous.
It can be.
It can destroy everything.
You know,
I think
It's better to sublimate our attraction into our work.
Let go!
Stop thinking.
Less tension.
Do less
I'm not doing anything.
Your blocking... leaning.
Doing too much... using too much force.
Just center yourself.
Why are you moving your head?
Follow me here.
Here!
Couldn't you encourage me instead of... criticizing me...
I'm trying... I'm really trying.
You simply let go.
Let go! Let go!
I'm trying to!
-Yes, I know.
-I'll let go.
You're doing it alone.
Wait for me.
Very good
Alright
More direct.
More prepared.
More direct.
No, don't move your arm.
There's a moment... as if it stops...
Stay there... That's the idea.
Stay there?
-Why are you stopping?
-Because you are.
I'm not, I'm ready!
You are stopping.
That's it.
-Better?
-Much better.
It was very good.
For the first time.
Very good.
Why are you afraid of me?
I'm not afraid of you, but of your weakness.
What weakness?
Your emotional weakness.
I'm not weak, I'm expressive.
Could I direct films if I were weak?
I've never seen you direct.
What?
You don't know how to recognize what I do.
I have eyes.
I haven't seen you do anything.
You don't know how to use your eyes.
You only want to be looked at.
Not to look.
That's why you don't see.
That's why you know nothing about film!
You know nothing about tango.
You know nothing about me.
Maybe I don’t want to know anymore!
Then it's over between us.
What is?
Exactly!
You've been using me... to live out your little fantasies.
Bullshit!
Sure. Anything else?
Ladies and gentlemen... after 7 years, our very own Pablito Veron is back!
A big round of applause for Pablo Veron!
You really don’t know what kind of film it will be?
Not yet.
What did you tell the producers?
Lies.
All right, Pablo.
Shall I teach you something?
Yes, of course.
Say to me, I am a dancer.
I am...
Why? You know that already.
Suppose I write a scene. where I tell something important to me... that I feel I am a Jew.
And I say to you,
And you, Pablo?
And you reply, I'm a dancer.
Pause...
And you add, And a Jew.
I might say that.
Then a tear rolls down my cheek...
And a tear rolls down your cheek.
A tear?
Maybe I don't want to do that.
Maybe I don't want to cry.
Anything else you don’t want to do?
Tell me now, because maybe
I don't want you in the film.
Maybe I don't want to be in your little film.
Fine, then I'll start looking for someone else.
Gallo ciego.
Pugliese.
Where are you from?
London
And you know our tangos?
Why not?
You have to have lived... suffered... to understand our tangos.
Tell me...
Are you alone?
Is it true you're going to make a film about Tango?
With Pablo?
Dance studio?
Dance studio?
This is it!
I can rent you... this half.
Perfect, right?
What's going on?
Nothing.
You seem different.
We're working, remember?
You seem absent somehow.
Did you enjoy dancing last night? it won’t be possible.
Are you sure?
It's closed. Nobody’s here.
How about later?
I don't think so.
We'll wait.
And also,
I don't belong in France but I don't belong here either.
I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?
Of being someone without roots.
I don't know where I come from nor where I'm going.
I'm afraid I'll disappear... without leaving a trace.
Perhaps that's why we met.
[ Man ]
It is so difficult to know where I should begin.
Especially when, unlike you,
I already know the ending.
But let us say that this story began with the end of another, far, far from the surf of Long Island.
For many years, I had absolutely no public life.
I had said, "No," to interviews so often, it was widely regarded as my forte.
Then, just once-- on impulse-- I said,
"Yes."
Does the 20th century play any part in your life?
I'm sorry?
Do you, for instance, use a word processor?
I'm a writer. I write.
I don't process words.
[ Interviewer ]
So, who do you write for?
Myself.
May I ask why you're here today?
Well, I was wondering that myself.
But... your... colleague was... a friend... of my late wife, who translated for the World Service.
And, of course, I do have a faint interest as to how these things are done, you know.
You've never been tempted to write for radio?
Or television?
I'm afraid not.
Would you permit your work to be adapted for the screen, now that even
E.M. Forster's been done?
Oh, I'd prefer not to be done.
[ Interviewer ]
But he's been done rather well, don't you think?
I've-- I've no idea.
I haven't been to the pictures for quite some time.
One or two?
One?
[ Man ]
Hey, are you sure this is the right window, man?
[ Man #2 ]
I-I don't know about this,
Corey. What if we get caught?
We're not gonna get caught, jerk-off!
And any minute now that room is gonna be filled with butt-naked babes.
[ Boys Laughing ] Hey, big guy, give me the camera.
[ Beeping Sound ]
Ahhh.
Oh, man!
Whoo-hoo!
Take it off, please!
She is so totally hot!
Someone's coming!
Christ, it's the Stomper!
Oh, I'm outta here!
What are you boys doing here?
You shouldn't be here!
This isn't E.M. Forster!
Hey, man, you got a rival.
Molly's in there with a guy!
What?
I'll kill him!
Come on.
Let's go!
Mikey?
You been beaten to it by your kid brother!
I think it's time for a pizza delivery, boys.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, wee.
Go get 'em, man!
Hoo-hoo!
Hey, what are you doin'?
[ Mikey ]
Hey, cut it out!
Go, dude, go!
Kick his ass!
Corey!
What's up?
Hey, come on, man.
We can talk about this.
Yeah?
[ Audience Laughing ]
Hiya, Molly.
What's happenin', baby?
[ Molly ]
Hi, Corey.
[ Mikey ]
Come on, man. Put me down! Put me down!
Corey, she made me do it.
Shut up, you little jerk-off!
You're just trying to make me jealous, huh?
Ah!
What a relief.
My wife must have known this would happen.
Tell me, Mrs. Reed, you live here alone now, don't you?
Yes.
Me alone.
But the... television.
The television?
It's mine. I like it.
You... watch the pictures?
[ Man On TV] Your specialized subject is Christopher Columbus.
You've two minutes starting now.
With subtitles.
By what name was
Columbus known in Spain?
Cristóbal Colón.
[ TVHost ]
Correct.
Of what did Columbus reputedly become the first European connoisseur?
Tobacco?
Correct.
How extraordinary.
Have you been locked out all day?
No! No, no. I--
Just for a short while.
I went to the pictures.
The cinema.
The ci-ne-ma.
I'm ever so sorry about yesterday.
And why is that?
About not being home when you needed the keys.
Well, I can hardly dictate what you do on your Sundays,
Mrs. Barker.
My sister in Whitstable's been poorly.
Needs a bit of helping out.
Is there anything else,
Mrs. Barker?
I was just going to mention--
My sister and I heard you on the wireless yesterday.
Tell me, you weren't taught by Forster when you were up at Cambridge?
Alas, no.
You know they're... even adapting his work for the pictures now?
Can't say that I approve.
It could have been a lot worse.
- Er, the adaptation?
- The interview.
Oh. In what way?
It could have been on television. That's a much... greater intrusion,
I can tell you.
Do you know you can get televisions that transcribe what people say?
May I ask, would that be another book?
Yes.
I'm afraid it is.
I don't know how you do it.
Takes me all my time to read one.
Well, as Gwen always used to say, it's easier to write one than it is to read one properly, Mrs. Barker.
[ Mutters ]
Yes,
I'm sure she did.
I can almost hear her saying it.
I've never really approved of the pre-Raphaelites.
Hmm?
Well, just look at him.
He's one of your sister's favorites.
What's meant to be going on?
Love letters, suicide-- that sort of thing?
More likely to be rejections from publishers.
Chatterton was a writer.
Oh.
I must get around to reading one of your books, Giles.
There never seem to be enough hours in the day.
Giles?
[ Thinking ]
Winsome, young, neoclassical.
Isolated... by beauty, death.
No smoking, guv.
Thanks very much.
- I beg your pardon?
- It says, "No smoking."
No. It says,
"Thank you for not smoking."
As I am smoking,
I don't expect to be thanked.
Can I help you?
Uh-- Yes--
- One for number three, please.
- Come again?
- Uh, one adult for number three.
- What do you want to see, sir?
- The film in number three.
- Which?
Uh, Hotpants College II.
Thank you.
[ People Murmuring ]
[ Students Chattering ]
The college girls are back!
Let's go!
Come on!
Hang on! All right?
Come on, Mom. I gotta go.
Today's a big day.
Oh, yeah? What's so special about it?
College girls are back in town, that's what.
Oh, I wish you'd keep your mind on school,
Corey, like your brother.
Yeah. Yeah.
He finds time to work at
Chicken Burger. Why can't you?

I'm sorry to disturb you, but I can't find them anywhere.
Uh, Mrs. Barker,
I've been thinking that, uh, it will be best if I was left undisturbed in the afternoon.
My work is very taxing at the moment.
What about your tea?
Oh, I'll call you when
I'm ready for it. But, um--
I must admit it's been... odd this last week.
It's that funny milk.
Uh-uh, what is it you were looking for?
The kitchen scissors.

Mrs. Barker,
I'll take tea now!
Is it on the left?
Or right?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Imagined Quiz Master ]
And what is your chosen specialized subject?
[ Thinking ]
The life and work of Ronnie Bostock.
You have two minutes on the life and work of Ronnie Bostock, starting... now.
Ronnie Bostock was born in Southern California but where does he live now?
Chesterton, Long Island.
Correct. What is the name of the dog which features... prominently in his publicity stills?
Strider.
Correct.
What is Ronnie Bostock's... favorite reading material?
Stephen King and science fiction.
Correct.
For what does Ronnie have a self-confessed weakness?
Pizza?
Yes. I'll accept that.
It's actually pizza with extra anchovies.
Under what circumstances would Ronnie do a nude scene?
If it were tasteful...
And?
Correct. essential to the plot.
Why was he not cast in the original Hotpants College?
Uh, too young?
No. He was unable... to break his contract with the sitcom
Home Is Where The Heart Is.
What is Ronnie's favorite kind of training shoe and why?
Reeboks, because
British stuff is cool.
Correct.
With which of his rock idols was he recently photographed?
Axl Rose.
Correct. Ronnie claims to like nothing better than hanging out with the guys.
What exactly do these "guys" mean to him?
I wonder.
[ Giles ]
Is that Chesterton there?
Chesterton.
You want?
Why not?
[ Clears Throat ]
For a change, yes?
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you.
I have, as usual, said you're far too busy.
But it is a very prestigious lecture,
Giles.
Would you advise me against it?
As your agent,
I would strongly urge you to do it. But... as a friend...
I wouldn't want to disturb your work, which seems to be so... invigorating, Giles.
I'll think about it.
Really?
Yes. I'm getting rather tired of hearing myself say no.
Now, you can help me, Henry.
What exactly is a "sitcom"?
No good, this program.
Really?
Here, this is better. Dog.
Do you like dogs,
Mr. De'Ath?
Need any help, sir?
Yes. I'm interested in acquiring a video player.
Uh, these are microwaves, sir.
Oh.
Video players are over here.
[ Salesperson ] Let's start with this little humdinger.
It's got it all, this one.
Nicam digital stereo, long-play facility,
1 4-day, eight-event timer, two-speed slow motion--
My needs are rather limited.
But it's top of the range, this one.
Oh, is it?
Yeah, and it's in your interest to keep up with the technology.
I'll get it, Mrs. Barker!
Delivery for Doctor Death.
Yes.
Is that your real name, then?
Pronounced "Day-aa-th."
Bet you get a lot ofjokes.
[ Mutters ]
Not since school.
Nice place.
All these books, they're not all different, are they?
- You read them all?
- Could we, uh--
Right.
Where's your telly?
- I'm sorry?
- Gogglebox. TV.
[ Chuckles ]
No. I don't have one.
Blimey! Well, what the hell's this for then?
Well, it's to watch films on, actually.
Yeah, but-- but what you gonna watch them on?
Well--
On the video?
Two pieces of identification, one proof of address--
I believe that qualifies me for membership.
There's a ten-pound deposit so you don't nick nothing, but you get a two-pound voucher for Bernie's Pizza delivery.
You can take out two tapes now if you want.
Um--
Could I forfeit my Bernie's Pizza voucher for a third one?
That's out.
I'm-- I'm sorry?
Tex Mex.
Went out an hour ago.
Really?
We only keep one of everything unless it's a big fuck off blockbuster.
I see.
That's in.
Harry-- Skid Marks.
No. Tape's buggered.
- Do you want to have another bash?
- Well, uh, uh--
Perhaps you have, uh,
Hotpants College II?
Harry! Hotpants I, II--
It's not out yet, is it?
Nah.
Got Hotpants I in.
Uh, may I place a reservation for Tex Mex?
No. There's no reservations.
Uh, you mean I have to wait two weeks, uh--
I hope not. You can only keep them out overnight.
Isn't one allowed two weeks at a library?
It takes two weeks to read a book, doesn't it?
Those things are more trouble than they're worth, if you ask me.
Uh, Mrs. Barker.
I've been thinking
I should be... starting to cope a little better on my own.
So, I won't be needing you after 2:00 in the afternoons.
But what about your dinner?
Oh, I'm quite sure that I can manage.
Oh, and I would... prefer it if you-- if you didn't clean in this room... at all.
What about the dust?
"The more one dusts, the more dust one makes," is what Gwen always used to say, Mrs. Barker.
This had better work.
Cool it, Pete. Have I ever let you down before?
Make sure you land him in the shit. 'Cause that's what he's done to us.
Hey, hey, hey.
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Get down. Get down.
Now!
[ Rider Screaming ]
[ Horse Whinnies ]
Wow.
Awesome.
Oh, shit!
Too darn right, Bozo.
You're in deep shit.
Yeah, man.
You know what you are?
You're nothing but a-- but a skid mark on the underpants of life.
[ Ronnie, Pete Laugh ]
Yeah!
He's coming.
He's coming.
[ Ronnie ]
So, if you take the entrance and project study--
[ Boys Laughing ]
[ Giles ]
If one has to have a theme, Henry, it would be... the discovery of beauty where no one ever thought of looking for it.
Ah, yes. Familiar territory for you.
Hardly. I have begun to engage in completely new subject matter.
New to me, at least.
Splendid. At our time of life, it's good to tackle something new.
I was considering golf, actually.
I could almost say that it has brought me into contact with... everything that
I myself have never been.
But that must be all for the time being, Henry.
Giles,
I'm very intrigued.
You may find it rather difficult to get in touch with me in the near future.
I'm finding it rather difficult now, old chap.
Hey, Jake!
Hey, hey, what's goin'on? Are you crazy?
Get out of the way, Johnny.
This ain't the way, Jake.
You heard what
Father Bryson said.
He said we all gotta learn how to get along.
[Jake ] Yeah?
Well I'm tired of these Mexicans taking jobs from my folks!
[Johnny ] They never took any job you want and you know it!
Just get out of the way, Johnny.
I ain't going anywhere.
You want to get to these boys, you have to go through me.
[Jake ]
Is that right?
[Johnny ] Yeah, that's right.
Oh, you did it now, Jake!
[ Groans ]
Save your breath, my child.
Oh, I tried to tell him,
Father. I tried. I tried.
[ Father Bryson ]
Hush now. God knows what you say is true, to be sure.
You were right, Father.
[ Panting, Groaning ]
We all got to try to live together.
[Johnny ]
I'll never forget what you said.
[ Groans, Expires ]
Johnny?
No!
[ Father Bryson ]
I promise you won't die in vain, my child.
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
[ Thinking ]
Forgive me, Ronnie.
[ Giles ] For is it not the case that when we are in the habit of viewing a film... more than once, assisted by that technological aide-memoire the video player, then a remarkable phenomenon presents itself.
We see... that what, at first, appeared to be merely accidental or unrehearsed... becomes on subsequent viewings an indelible part of the film's texture.
A distant landscape, a blurred face in the crowd, even a banal message on a T-shirt.
So, the largely unrecognized art of film acting... depends entirely on the ability of the actor-- or, indeed, actress-- to make everything about himself-- uh, or herself-- seem equally permanent.
When, thus, an actor is called upon to smile, he must try to select a smile from a collection-- a repertoire-- a whole file of smiles, as it were.
Naive, rueful, sly, sarcastic... and so on.
Anyway, to return to my theme of "The Death of the Future--"
Don't you think you've been overdoing it, old chap?
We're not as young as we used to be, after all.
Maybe you should... take a break.
Go on a trip.
Do you the world of good.
A trip?
Yes. I-I know you think that traveling for its own sake is frivolous, but...
I must insist that you seriously consider it.
[ Phone Ringing ]
[ Beep ]
[ Answering Machine Message ]
This is Giles De'Ath speaking.
If your call is extremely urgent, you may leave a brief message after I finish speaking.
[ Beep ]
Good, Lord!
Giles? It's Henry.
You have an answer phone.
Whatever next?
[Jet Engine Roaring ]
[Jet Engine Roaring ]
But, um, isn't there a guest house or something of that nature?
Well, now, there's a motel.
Motel?
Yeah. On the expressway.
Oh, no. That would be out of the question.
The room is quiet?
We take a pride in the secluded nature of our accommodation.
How long will you be with us?
Uh, at least a week or two.
Are you touring
Long Island?
[ Nervous Chuckle ]
No. No, not really.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, a writer!
From London too.
Oh, my.
Well, we're charmed to have you, uh, Mister, uh--
De'Ath.
Well...
Mister, anything you want to know about Chesterton... you just ask me.
Hmmm.
[ Sighs ]
Oh--
Good Lord!
[ Patrons Chattering,
Utensils Clattering ]
You're lookin' very spiffy today.
Sir?
You're looking very spiffy today.
Very attractive.
Oh, thank you.
Has Lou taken your order yet?
I-I must admit I'm... having a little difficulty understanding the menu.
Get him a cup of coffee.
[ Giles ]
What would you recommend?
Oh, we do a great cheeseburger.
Oh, I think not.
The best hash browns you ever tasted?
[ Chuckles ]
That rather goes without saying.
There you are.
Thank you.
So... you're from England, huh?
Yes.
You ever bumped into a fellow by the name of Stan Brighouse?
I believe not.
An attractive man, average-sized hands.
But he had breasts... like a woman.
Very odd.
He was a nice person, though.
You should look him up.
Anyway, I'm Irv, by the way.
Hence, "Chez d'Irv."
You got it.
Irving Buckmuller at your service.
This area here... is very attractive.
This is where a person like you should be staying.
It's secluded?
Oh, you'll love it.
Yeah.
Where the odd celebrity might hide out, no doubt.
Exactly. Exactly.
And you know what?
They all know Irv's.
Everyone of'em knows Irv's. Right, Lou?
How you doin'?
Good morning.
- Hey, that's a great tie.
- Thank you.

[ Moaning,

This is too much!
[ Louder Moaning

Yes. Mrs. Abbott, is there any possibility of your more, uh, short-term guests not having rooms next to mine?
Well, yes, I do appreciate that, but I also value my own privacy.
[ Rumbling, Whimpering ]
Yes, indeed.
It is interrupting my work.
Over here you ask for the cheque and pay with a bill.
Over here you ask for the cheque and pay with a bill.
In England, you ask for a bill and pay with a cheque.
Hmm. Is that the truth?
[ Chuckles ]
Yes.
No shit!
[ Laughs ]
A writer here, from London, England.
Likes words.
[ Women Chattering ]
Aha!
How you doin' today?
Oh, uh, very well, thank you.
You live around here?
No, no. Well, not yet, at least.
I'm-- I'm, uh... looking at property for sale.
You're movin' to Chesterton?
Well, it's a poss--
[ Car Passing ]
Great wheels, huh?
[ Mumbles ]
Yes.
You know, you'd cover a lot more ground in a car.
Yes. I suppose I would.
Uh-uh, may I go on my way?
Sure. We just like to know what strangers are up to, that's all.
[ Chuckles ]
You take care, now.
[ Mutters ]
Yeah.
[ Electronic Chirp ]

Please move away immediately!

[ Ringing Continues ]
Hello?
Ah, Mrs. Abbott.
Yes. A typewriter seems to have appeared in my room.
Oh. How very thoughtful of you.
Cocktails?
No. I'm afraid not. I have to be up at the crack of dawn.
Good morning!
Hey, how you doin'?
What happened to your foot?
Oh, less torture.
You take it easy now.
Hey, Strider.
You go home now.
Strider.
[ Panting ]
[ Whimpering ]
Strider?
[ Dog Barks,
Growls ]
I had one once called "Tiffy."
"Tiffy"? What kind of a--
What is that? Wha--
What's that, a pansy name?
Come on! Tiffy lived to be 1 5.
We're not talking about how long the dog lived.
Caesar.
We're talking about names.
There are a lot of Caesars around.
What about "Spot"?
Spot! That's the name that everybody calls a dog-- Spot.
What if the dog has no spots?
They all got spots.
No. Sometimes they got patches.
And there's a difference between a patch and a spot.
Then they call it
"Patch" or "Patchy."
Or "Patch"-- "Patches."
If he's got stripes, they call it "Stripey."
That's stupid.
Or "Stripes."
Come on.
Why?
Do you want a dog, Giles?
I can get you puppies for free.
No, no, no, no, no.
I just heard some rather strange names, that's all.
Uh, is Strider common?
Rider?
Striper?
Strider?
Strider.
Striper?
Strider?
Strider.
I never heard of it.
Strider?
I never of it.
Oh, sure. Strider, Caesar.
[ Scoffs ] They're all a damned nuisance.
You never knew Tiffy.
[ Clattering ]
[ Woman ]
Strider?
Strider!
[ Dog Growling ]
What is it, boy?
It's just a squirrel, you idiot. Come on. In.
I can't take you to the supermarket. Jesus.
[ Car Door Slams,

It's an emergency!
You need a hospital?
Nearest supermarket. Move over, please. It-It is an emergency!
[ Car Door Slams,
Tires Screech,
Car Departs ]
Hey!
Oh!
I am most dreadfully sorry.
I do hope nothing is broken.
I guess not.
We just don't have things this size in England.
Rather tricky to control.
It's okay.
Take it easy.
Oh, haven't-- haven't we met?
[ Sighs ]
I don't think so.
Ah, no. I've seen your photograph.
Are you a film star?
Would you mind just leaving me alone?
Oh, no, of course! You're engaged to Abigail's idol.
I could really do without this.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Uh, my godchild, Abigail, has a huge crush on this very young... and, uh, uh, promising
American actor and his name is Ronnie--
Is it, no. Ronnie--
Ronnie Bostock, isn't it?
You made a very handsome couple.
[ Woman ]
What kind of books do you write?
Oh, I'm hardly a household name over here.
Are you working on one now?
Well, if I'm inspired by the soothing rustle of the Long Island surf, as your
Walt Whitman put it.
I hope you have a great time.
Are you over for long?
Excuse me?
From Hollywood.
Oh, we live here.
Oh, really?
Ron's in L.A. right now.
I just can't believe he's so big in England.
- I never knew that.
- [ Chuckles ]
It's extremely kind of you.
This isn't
Manhattan.
You can't just hail a cab.
Indeed.
You've got a lot of groceries for someone staying at a motel.
Yes. I've-- I've always been rather vague about domestic arrangements, but I wanted to find out how Americans shop, what you eat and so on.
Actually, I can heartily recommend the cheeseburgers at Chez d'Irv.
[ Groans ]
God, you've been to that dive?
Well, perhaps you can recommend somewhere superior.
There are some great seafood places up the coast, but you gotta drive there.
Well, allow me to take you out for a spot of lunch.
Oh, I couldn't, really.
To thank you for your kindness.
Uh, I don't think so.
[ Seagulls Squawking ]
Very impressive. You're both very talented, my dear.
[ Chuckles ] Thanks.
Well, you must give
Ronnie tips, no doubt.
Tips?
Well, doesn't he have to do photographs for the fan magazines?
Oh, photo shoots. Tell me about it. He hates them.
Oh, seems rather good at it.
Oh, sure. It just--
He thinks you can't be a teen idol if you're gonna be a serious actor.
Oh, does he?
It's crazy. I mean, most of the actors I know wait tables.
Why would they do that?
I can't wait to tell him I've met a famous British writer... who thinks he's got the look of a young Olivier, was it?
Uh, a little.
[ Chuckles ]
I should be writing this down.
Hey, maybe you could do a script for him or something.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, I don't exactly write for the youth market, Audrey.
Oh, well, that's great. He's so sick of playing dumb kids.
Oh--
[ Phone Ringing ]
It's okay, the machine's on.
[ Audrey's Voice ] Hi, we're not home. Leave a message.
[ Man's Voice ]
Hey, babe. Honey?
Uh, I guess you're out... again. [ Chuckles ]
It's Ron.
[ Ronnie ]
You better not be having a good time without me.
[ Ronnie ]
Things are pretty cool here.
I'll talk to you later. Love you.
[ Audrey ] I'll call him later.
Oh, Giles, I forgot.
[ Machine Beeps ]
You can smoke here if you want. We don't, but--
Giles? Are you okay?
Dear God, this is ridiculous!
[ Chuckles ]
[ Audrey ]
It's incredible.
He's seen all your work.
And he says that you're really big in England!
You'd just love him.
He's so British, you wouldn't believe it.
[ Laughs ]
Screw you! He's old enough to be my father.
So, Ronnie will be back soon?
Uh-huh.
Do give him my regards.
Sure.
Tell him that I will be following his career with great interest.
Maybe you should tell him.
I'd like him to meet you.
I guess you're busy, though, with your writing?
Well, yes, I am, but--
Oh, I don't know.
We're really busy too.
And he can get kind of shy. I don't know, maybe he'll call you.
[ Man On Radio ]
Now get only a--

[ Door Closes ]
[ Typewriter Keys Clacking ]
[ Beeping On TV]
[ Phone Ringing ]
[ Ringing Continues ]
[ Bird Squawking ]
So, Giles, he may not show it, right, but he really wants to hear what you told me... about his potential.
Oh, really?
Really.
He's been kind of low since he got back.
If you could find some way of telling him what you think of him, well, I'd really appreciate it.
[ Ronnie ]
Well, what do you know?
It was the cops.
They're keepin' an eye on the place.
One of the neighbors saw some weirdo hangin' around.
[ Audrey ]
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you.
Are you guys comin'in or what?
Come on, Strider.
[ Audrey ]
It's nothing really, Giles.
Shakespeare?
Oh, yes, his plays are full of it.
Well, wait a minute.
Are you saying that if
Shakespeare was alive today, he'd be doin' things like Hotpants College?
All I'm saying, Ronnie, is that Shakespeare used bawdy humor to please the mob in the pit.
I never knew that.
Yes, and, of course, he was able to elevate his material... beyond such limitations... as have you.
I'm not talking about good acting as if it were, say, merely good cooking.
Oh, by the way, the teriyaki was delicious, Audrey.
Thanks.
I'm talking about a type of acting that is purely instinctive.
You see, Ronnie, you have something that gives even the most casual look or gesture... a real intensity.
Yeah?
Oh, yes.
It came as no surprise to me when I heard that you'd been rescued at an early age... from the hell of advertising.
It was obvious to me that some producer, some astute producer, had seen what I saw when Abigail persuaded me to see Hotpants College II.
I got that role because
I looked like the guy who played Mikey in the original.
Yes, but didn't you completely reinvent the character with a mere string of lines?
Didn't you make Mikey the focus of the entire story?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.
As for your fate in the pizza parlor, the plastic tomato and all that, well--
[ Laughs ]
Well, I don't know.
This may sound absurd, but--
No, my point of reference would be Wallis' painting... of the tragic young writer
Chatterton... that hangs in the Tate Gallery.
[ Audrey Sighs ]
I'd really like to see that.
But, Giles, we've seen
Hotpants in theaters with kids.
They don't get any of that.
- Of course not.
- But it's made for them.
But they're the rabble in the pit.
[ Audrey Laughs ]
We saw Hotpants at this drive-in used to be here.
Ron kept his sunglasses on the whole time.
Giles, did you ever see Tex Mex?
Oh, I did indeed, more than once.
Really killed me when that one bombed.
Ah, yes, I'm afraid it suffered the same fate in Europe.
I really believed in that project.
It had-- had a real message.
Yes, it was a great shame really.
In Europe, we have a much stronger tradition of work... with what you call a message.
That is, after all, why I've been persuaded to write my first screenplay.
Yes, if Tex Mex had been, say,
German about the plight of the exploited Gastarbeiters, it would have met with a far greater success.
They have Mexicans in Germany?
It probably would have made less money than Hotpants, but in Europe we're not necessarily interested in that kind of a success, not when a film can change the way people think.
And that, Ronnie, is why I write.
It's also why you act, although you may not yet know it.
[ Whirring ]
[ Ronnie ]
You married or somethin'?
I was. My wife died unexpectedly sometime ago.
Sorry to hear that.
Got any kids?
No, no, my wife was rather older than myself.
Oh, like me and Aud.
Yes, indeed.
So what's this script about?
Script?
Yeah, you said you were working on a screenplay.
Oh, yes, that.
Oh, I couldn't subject you to work in progress.
Why not?
Then, of course, there is the risk of copyright infringement.
[ Laughs ]
Giles, we're old friends, huh?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Ronnie ]
Coffee always takes her forever.
[ Giles ] Indeed.
Hey, Strider.
So what's it about?
Well, it concerns a young man, Ronnie, about your age,
I suppose.
He's a deaf-mute... brought up in complete isolation.
His only human contact is through the television.
So he has been subjected to rather excessive... and unrealistic types of behavior.
He never speaks?
Oh, he cannot speak.
Wow.
Oh, yes, I'm determined that the audience share his subjective state... rather than merely pity him because, well, that would be awful.
Yeah, yeah.
So what happens?
Understandably enough, he yearns to enter the real world.
So he surrenders himself to the most irrational desire... known to mankind.
Maybe you can guess what that is?
[ Steam Hissing In Kitchen ]
It is the desire to fall in love, Ronnie.
And since he's been exposed to such a thing on the television every day, it becomes his quest, so to speak.
And every tale, whether it be Richard The Third... or Hotpants College The Third, centers upon a quest.
And as in my other work, it will inevitably end with a sacrifice.
The French, in particular, seem to like such a thing.
However, I suspect it is not one for the drive-ins.
Oh, thank you, my dear.
Decaf au lait, no doubt?
Uh-huh.
Thanks, babe.
It's brilliant, man.
Oh, I don't think so, not yet. Please.
No, it is.
I've never heard a story line like that.
I'm totally blown away.
That's very kind of you.
- It's kind of artsy, I guess.
- Oh, dear. Is that bad?
No, no, that's good.
Have you seen Birdy?
Birdy?
Birdy, yeah, it's an Alan Parker film.
I met him once.
He's from England too.
Ah.
[ Phone Ringing ]
[ Beeps, Whirs ]
That's just a fax.
Probably more rewrites.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
You can smoke, Giles.
[ Laughs ]
You smoke?
[ Groans ]
Bad habit.
Oh, yes, I know.
We'd never have met if he didn't.
Really?
Why is that?
Giles chose to stay in Chesterton because he smokes Chestertons.
Cool.
Giles?
You know what you were saying about being a writer... and wanting new experiences and all?
I don't know.
Maybe it's not such a good idea.
Come on. Tell us, babe.
Well, I was just thinking.
I have a shoot in the city tomorrow... and I just thought maybe you'd like to come.
They're so boring.
Not necessarily.
Not if you haven't been on one.
I'm not comin'.
I'm not inviting you.
They're totally boring.
Wouldn't I be in the way?
I'd love you to come.
I'm sure you'd get some great ideas.
I got a better idea.
Why don't I show you the Hamptons?
You don't like the Hamptons.
I do off-season.
What do ya say?
It's such a choice.
One couldn't do both?
No way.
Okay, I'll tell you what.
If the weather's okay, we'll go to the coast.
If it's rainy, you go into the city with the supermodel here.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, that does sound fair.
Okay, babe?
[ Man ]
LaRue digs it out in the corner--
So things look good for Washington and Baltimore tomorrow.
It's a different story in New York. Look at those clouds gobbling up Manhattan.
They're sure to bring rain tomorrow and plenty of it.
Over in Long Island, it's gonna be even worse with both coasts pulling in that low pressure.
[ Traffic Passing ]
[ Laughing ]
Can we have your autograph?
Here. Try these on.
[ Indistinct ]
Oh, no, no, no.
Go ahead. Put 'em on.
It's bright out there.
Very nice.
Very nice indeed.
[ Giles ]
"Hey, dude, how's it hanging?"
[ Ronnie ]
"It's cool."
"Hey, man, I'm real sorry about your mother.
Life's a bitch, huh?"
"Yeah, I guess.
You know somethin', Brad?
I wish I could have made things easier for her."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah.
"It seemed like she was always workin' and stuff.
Never really got a chance to know her."
"Hey, man, don't grief out on me."
"Sorry, man.
Just feelin' a bit lonesome, you know?"
"Hey, you're a college boy now.
All those babes don't want to see you lonesome."
"Sure, like
I'm Mr. Popular."
"Well, I'm going to make you
Mr. Popular, and that's a promise."
Mmm!
A poignant little scene.
It sets up the whole story line.
I go to college.
All the college girls try to mother me.
But I fall in love with a teacher whose husband turns out to be a grand wizard in the KKK.
Uh, something of a message there?
It's the usual stuff.
Tell me, do you get a chance to deliver a eulogy to your mother?
No, no, no way.
It would hold up the action.
- You're allowed to improvise?
- Thanks, babe.
They get pretty nervous about that.
Hmph.
What's the point?
Where you been hidin'yourself?
I was talking to our neighbor. Is that okay?
Is this one of those telephones that doesn't have to be plugged in?
Quite remarkable, isn't it?
Hey, I have a great idea.
Giles, why don't you call your godchild in England?
I'm sorry?
Abigail, wasn't it?
You could call her and tell her you're sitting here with Ronnie Bostock.
Ron could say hi to her.
I know she'd just die.
Well, I'm afraid--
I'm afraid it's the middle of the night in England.
They're only five hours ahead.
You know what, Aud?
That's about the stupidest idea
I ever heard. What am I supposed to say to the kid?
Huh? I'm sorry,
Giles.
Oh.
Jesus!

Now, voyager, sail thou forth to seek and find."
[ Chuckling ]
[ Man ]
Let's go. Bring him home.
Bring him home.
I suspect you're going to have to explain the rules to me.
Okay, you gotta hit the ball and run around the bases to home.
Hence, baseball.
Hmm, rather like circular cricket.
I guess.
[ Applause, Cheering ]
Is there something wrong, Audrey?
We're going to see my folks tomorrow up in Vermont.
Vermont?
For a week.
For a week?
Before Ron has to go back.
That's a strike, Giles.
To, uh, Los Angeles?
Right.
Ronnie never mentioned this.
He doesn't know yet.
You understand that we still have a lot of work to do on the script.
That's too bad.
I guess he'll get by.
[ Umpire ]
Strike!
That's a strike, too, Giles.
Audrey, surely it is as clear to you as it is to me... that he deserves a great deal more than "getting by."
He'll do it this time.
He never gets struck out.
Watch this, Giles.
It's gonna be a good one.
The bases are loaded.
You realize this is... a very crucial moment in his life.
God, you're good.
-[ Man ] All right!
-[ Bat Hits Ball ]
[ Applause, Cheering ]
That's a home run, Giles.
Ronnie.
So... this is your last day in Long Island.
Or, should one say, on Long Island?
Yeah, Aud's gettin' kind of itchy, so--
I'm also leaving
Long Island soon.
Really?
We should hook up in Europe sometime.
I'd like that.
Ronnie, I'd like that very much.
Of course, you must honor your obligations to Audrey.
It strikes me that you're very young to be making such a commitment, especially with your career at this crucial stage.
Yeah, well, a guy's got to know when he's on to a good thing, right?
It was like that for you, wasn't it?
Uh, well,
I suppose so, yes.
It's a birthmark.
They cover it up for shooting, but I like it.
You know, I always thought it was on the right.
How do you mean?
Ronnie, I have a confession to make to you.
I've been waiting for you for quite some time.
Oh, shit, Giles, I'm sorry.
I had to drop Aud--
Several years, in fact.
What?
Ronnie, there is nothing more solitary than an artist's life.
No doubt you'll find that out for yourself.
Painfully, perhaps.
One yearns for solace without quite knowing where to look for it.
But I found it in you.
Oh--
That's great.
Ronnie, I have another confession to make.
I brought you here not to say good-bye, but to make you an offer.
An offer?
I am prepared to devote myself to your career.
Wow, Giles, I, uh--
[ Clears Throat ]
I'm honored.
I don't know what to say.
You got to come out west.
We can start to work on something.
No, Ronnie, forget Los Angeles.
Put it behind you.
Your future lies in Europe.
Giles, I gotta take things one step at a time.
Aud would love to go back to Europe and do more work.
It would be cool to spend time there--
"Cool"?
I'm talking about a turning point in your life.
But I've got no contacts there.
People know me here.
As what?
Ronnie, as what?
Look, um, we'll keep in touch, huh?
Listen to me, Ronnie.
In Europe, it is often the case that a-- a young man benefits from the-- the wisdom and the experience of an elder.
Why, there's almost a tradition of such friendships.
Cocteau and Radiguet.
Uh, Verlaine, Rimbaud.
Rambo?
Arthur Rimbaud,
French poet.
He--
He was Paul Verlaine's lover.
Look, Giles, uh,
I really gotta go.
I gotta pick up Aud.
I don't want her to be--
Now, listen.
I understand your misgivings, and I respect the fact that your immediate plans... are founded on these temporary attachments.
"Temporary attachments"?
Well, Ronnie, your relationship with Audrey... is hardly likely to last forever.
And why is that?
Well, it-- I'm afraid it's obvious to me.
What exactly are you tryin' to say, Giles?
[ Whispers ]
Ronnie, please.
Look, Giles.
I would like to believe all the things you said about my career, but you got things all wrong.
Ronnie.
Ronnie, listen to me.
You don't understand.
Giles, I think
I do understand, and I have to go now.
How can you act like this... when you know--
You must know how completely, how desperately...
I love you.
[ Door Bell Dings ]
Dear God, what have I done?
[ Man ]
Back where he should be in the lineup tonight.
His batting average is .395, just what it should be.
Now the question is, how many hits is he gonna get tonight?
How ya doin'?
I wonder if you could do me a great favor and add this to your deliveries?
I don't know if I can do that, sir.
It's a federal offense.
Surely--
I'm sorry, sir.
[ Engine Starts ]
[ Phone Rings, Fax Beeps ]
[ Giles ]
My dear Ronnie, it is so difficult to know... where I should begin, especially when, unlike you,
I already know the ending.
But let us say that this story began with the end of another, far, far from the surf of Long Island.
Tell me, when one sends a fax, uh, is it possible for it to be reversed?
How do you mean, sir?
Well, can it be got back?
I don't know about that.
I imagine not.
You wanna turn back?
Oh, I think it's rather late for that.
You sure?
Quite sure, thank you.
Hey!
[ Giles ]
Well, Ronnie, there it is, the end of our story.
And also the beginning of a new story for me, but perhaps you've worked that out for yourself.
But what of you, my darling?
For no one on Earth knows you better than I do.
And if you've read thus far,
I know you'll never bring yourself to destroy this letter... nor will you ever show it to anyone else.
And it will gradually dawn on you that your life might have taken a very different course... had you simply been able to open your heart to another.
And you'll often return to this letter.
You'll read it again and again in the years to come... until you no longer have to read what you'll know by heart.
And you'll cherish it as a source of pride... in the face of an uncaring world.
I'd like to say a few words by Walt Whitman, if that's okay with everyone.
"Now finale to the shore.
"Now land and life, finale and farewell.
"The untold want by life and land never granted.
"Now, voyager, sail thou forth... to seek and find."
This isn't make-believe.
- It really happened.
- Come off it!
Okay, leave that.

Goodness!
What have they done?
- Isn't that the Lopez's house?
- Yes.
- Look at the state of it!
- You can imagine, auntie.
- What's become of them?
- They were among the first to go.
Really?
Of course.
- What about your husband?
- Adolfo?
You know how he loves Havana.
He's at one of his meetings.
Please, friends, please.
We're making this issue more complicated than it really is.
Justifiably so!
No. I've got to get back to
Camagüey as soon as possible.
This is a clear-cut issue.
If a man dies in Baracoa, he should be buried there.
After all, it's one and the same country.
Look here, Rivero, if I die in Baracoa, no way is anyone going to force me to be buried there.
I'm from Santa Clara, and all my family and friends live there.
Take it easy, friends, cool down.
Exuse me, Benito.
Look here, Rivero,
I agree with Paula.
It's not my fault if
I die in Baracoa.
- I might just be visiting friends.
- Who asked you, anyway?
Friends, don't all speak at once!
Go ahead, Adolfo...
What if... we share the body out among all of us?
Be more specific.
If each provincial company assumes responsibility for its own territory, if we each agree to transport the body across our province, then we all have less to do.
In which case no one will exceed the petrol allowance granted to each undertaker.
Look, Justo, if we carry out a careful, on-the-spot study, adhering to the proper procedures, the plan has to work.
- I totally reject such a wild idea.
- Me too.
It's okay for you, because you're from Guantánamo and there are no other towns in this direction.
But I'm from Santa Clara, smack in the middle of the island.
Every corpse on the island will be stopping off there.
I'm no stepping stone,
Adolfo!
Friends, it's no good just considering our own problems.
We're losing the overall view of the matter.
We have to think patriotically.
This isn't a local tavern.
They may have given
Adolfo the boot but he still seems to be well-connected.
What's the alternative, auntie?
You have to survive somehow.
Are you still unoccupied, Gina?
You've not gone back to teaching?
Back to teaching?
With all the trouble I had at the University?
Here theory and practice are two different things. I'm not going through all that again.
Yes, but there are otherjobs.
You can't stay shut up in the house.
What happened about that radio programme you mentioned?
A youth guidance programme on the radio?
Now?
You've no idea what a problem that would be.
Auntie, you're not going to smoke?
After the lunch we've just had!
Do you want one?
No, besides Adolfo doesn't like me smoking.
But Adolfo is in Havana, my dear!
What became of...?
He always asks after you.
Do you still think about him?
We'll probably bump into him.
I don't know why you're so worked up.
It's been fifty years,
Gina, fifty years.
A lot of things have changed. I don't want him to see me like this.
- Like what, Auntie?
- Come off it, Gina. Like this.
I was seventeen when he last saw me.
He's no eighteen-year-old now, either.
Georgina
Travieso!
Reglita Campoamor!
Hello, Gina.
Small world, isn't it?
Guantánamo is, you mean.
You haven't changed a bit.
Come on in, both of you.
What's new in Havana?
Come in.
Tell me about yourself.
Did you ever get married?
So long ago I hardly remember.
My roots are in this town.
Why, I've never even been to Santiago de Cuba.
You're joking!
- Have you any children?
- Two. A girl and a boy.
- I'd love to meet them.
- Pop round and visit.
It suits you to a T. I'm going to buy you it.
No, Auntie. I never go out anywhere.
Besides, Adolfo doesn't like such low necklines.
CULTURE IS IMMORTAL.
Citizens of Guantámano!
For fifty years, during which her art has been acclaimed in theatres the world over,
Georgina Travieso was not just Georgina Travieso.
For many she was
Cecilia Valdés, or Madame Butterfly, or María la O or Luisa Fernanda...
Look how young you were up on the bandstand!
A mere stripling.
I feel like a naughty girl.
Gina must be looking for me all over.
And that gossip Regla will have a field day tomorrow.
What about this young girl?
I'm sure I've seen her recently.
I can't imagine who it could be.
I must be going a bit soft in the head.
I don't think you were ever quite right in the head.
How young we were then!
Do you know I still have your blue ribbon?
My blue ribbon?
You've forgotten!
Don't you remember, when you left, you promised me you'd return and you gave me your blue hair ribbon as a token?
Now I remember.
You came to see me off.
It was raining buckets...
No, Cándido, it wasn't raining.
I remember it was a gorgeous day.
Yes it was raining.
I've never since seen a sun as beautiful as that morning.
It was so cloudy
I couldn't tell when night fell.
Nightfall?
But it was midday, Cándido.
It was night, I tell you, night.
How could it be night when the train left at 1 p.m.?
Here it is!
I'm like the white swan
which dies singing.
How young we were then!
When I get sentimental, do you know what I do?
I close my eyes and imagine things.
We're by a river bank,
I'm twenty, and you're sixteen.
You look handsome in your blue suit.
Now you're getting the hem of your dress wet in the river.
- Oh, the water's cold!
- You're about to fall and I...
What are you doing?
Mother will see us!
I love you.
I've loved you these fifty years.
Don't open your eyes.
Imagine that not a single day has gone by.
I want us to be together until the end.
When I saw you again,
I almost ran away.
I don't know,
I was scared.
And I felt pain, here, in my jaw.
But now everything is going to be different.
We'll never part again.
Isn't that so?
Yoyita!
... that dies singing...
... dies singing... dies singing...
Adolfo!
What? Yes, this has to run like clockwork... what's up?
Listen, your wife's calling.
My wife?
She says it's urgent.
Excuse me.
Hello, Gina.
What's wrong?
What?
That's impossible.
Can nothing be done?
Yes, darling. I'll leave for the airport right now.
Listen, leave everything to me.
Don't you do anything, do you hear?
Yes, listen, speak to Felo, to Felo.
Tell him to get busy with the formalities.
But don't you do anything.
You take it easy, my love.
Do you hear? Yes...
Aunt Yoyita!
Power cuts here as well?
The route is quite clear, Tony.
We bypass Santiago, go straight to Bayamo, and then on to Las Tunas.
I'll tell you the other stops on the way.
Guantánamo, Bayamo,
Las Tunas.
Okay.
We'll follow the hearse in your "Volga".
The corpse ahead and the uproar behind.
Okay.
Adolfo, Cándido wants to ask you a favour.
Go ahead, Cándido.
Listen, Adolfo, I've got no one left in the world...
He wondered if he could accompany
Aunt Yoyita to Havana with us.
Of course, Cándido.
You're like one of the family.
I'd already allowed for such a contingency and requested a permit for four people.
One moment...
Let's get this ready.
It's all right, it's all right like that.
Right, Adolfo...
Make sure you call Tirso.
Give him the exact departure time.
SOCIALISM OR DEATH.
Cándido is upset
because he has lost
his beloved.
The woman he longed for
has been taken from him
for the second time.
The funeral committee
leaves behind,
the East
and rolls westward
to accomplish its mission.
Guantanamera,
guajira guantanamera,
guantanamera,
guajira guantanamera...
Puchi, are you romantic?
You bet your balls!
Come on, baby, off you go, I'm in a hurry.
You're acting strange.
You've been acting very strange with me just lately. What's up?
Nothing. I've got to go.
Why?
You promised you'd take me to Havana this time.
It's just that this trip came up unexpectedly.
You already told me that one.
I'm too old for stories.
I've bet all my aces on you.
Look at the time!
I can't go back home now.
- Well, Marilis, that's how it is.
- What do I get out of it? Nothing!
You've used me and now you've got to take me to Havana.
Mariano,
I'm pregnant.
And my husband won't have a baby that's not his.
Is that clear?
He won't stand for it.
Shit, Marilis!
Listen, don't get all worked up. Calm down!
Bloody well calm down.
It's you that's got me into trouble.
Wait, we're going to talk things through.
- I promised to take you to Havana.
- Yes.
Okay, calm down. I'll take you.
We'll sort things out somehow.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Yes.
Wait for me here then. I'll get my things and be back in a flash.
And we'll set off for Havana.
That looks good!
Ramón!
Listen, Ramón!
Lets go.
- Get your stuff, we're off.
- Why? Look at the time.
Come on, mate.
- I'm in real trouble.
- What sort of trouble?
- Have you run somebody over?
- No! I'll explain on the way.
It's over Marilis. All his problems are over women.
- Oh no! Leave me out of it.
- That Marilis has gone crazy.
- I don't believe it...
- Come on, I'll explain on the way.
Come here. Lets load this rice.
O for the day when
I don't have to run off...
Tell her I'm not here.
- Marilis, what a coincidence!
- What a coincidence!
We were just talking about you.
- Just now.
- What kind of coincidence?
Where's Mariano?
He'll be back shortly.
He went to cut a bunch of bananas to take to Havana.
He'd do better to cut some flowers for his funeral because when I catch him,
I'll murder him. No man
- stands me up.
- Mariano was just saying
- we should pick you up.
- Stop protecting him.
You men are all the same.
- Leave Ramón out of it!
- He's another prime example.
You're the slut! You've been laid by all the men in La Maya.
Sour grapes, because you're fat and undesirable. I'm going in.
Over my dead body!
I won't have whores in my house.
How much?
The garlic? A buck or sixty pesos.
A buck, boss.
Interested?
Music Man?
A buck or sixty pesos.
That's half my wage.
- How many have you got?
- Six.
Give me all six.
Here.
They'll cry out for this in Havana.
Make a bit of room.
Hey! Have you got any food?
Food?
Only cigarettes and tobacco.
The 1,650 acres of beans
planted
in the state co-operative
and rural sectors
represent a new
record figure...
You undertakers shouldn't overdo things.
There aren't enough coffins.
... reached 28,
smashing the previous
record of 528 acres
in the winter harvest.
So a new record has been
set in local agriculture.
This is going to be a real success.
Now I'll make a name for myself.
... decisive result in the national
development plan...
Hey, listen, mate.
You're an expert in this witchcraft stuff.
Can't you magic away my problem with women?
You can't solve that with spells, Mariano.
It's simpler than that.
But I'm sick of teaching a reluctant learner.
The fancy women that you always go for think they have rights, and so make demands:
You can't have other women, you have to marry her, and take her to Havana.
We don't need that hassle, mate.
Just imagine if we had those problems in every town we visited.
Take me, I've no problems with my old lady.
But not you.
You have to go for the classy ones.
And to boot, you always have one up your sleeve.
Make your mind up.
Marry one, take her to Havana, be a good husband, do right by her, she's the one who should be first class.
But on the road, a bit on the side never did any harm.
On the road, well, on the road anything goes, plump or skinny.
I've got my old lady in Havana and I keep her warm and happy.
She's the one who'll look after me when I'm old.
That's life, Mariano.
Look what happened to old Manuel.
When he got a bit past it, all those women he had in tow couldn't be seen for dust.
Only someone who really loves you puts up with you when you're old.
No one went to his wake.
They sent his body to the medical school for dissection.
That's the worst thing:
Knowing you're going to die alone, with nobody at your side to close your eyes.
Come on, stop dramatizing!
Do me a favour.
I'm stuck here with the family.
Can you give us a lift?
- Where are you going?
- To Las Tunas.
- Three hundred pesos?
- Whatever you say, friend.
I just want to get out of here.
Up you go, be quick! When
I'm loaded up, this is risky.
Let's hurry!
Get a move on there!
Miss...
- Can you let us jump the queue?
- Sorry, I can't.
Look, we've got a corpse to take to Havana.
Yes, love, I appreciate your problem, but all we've got here is tamarind juice.
- Fine, I'll take five.
- I'm sorry, love, but until the ice arrives,
I can't start selling.
Order two coffees,
I'm going to the toilet.
Two coffees, pal.
I could do with a little water.
The manager, please.
Thanks.
Sorry!
Professor!
Mariano.
- Are you working here?
- No.
Well, yes. That's where I work.
- Didn't you finish University?
- Yes, I did.
I became an engineer.
Well?
You can imagine.
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.
It's not too hard.
I even earn more.
Good.
- Are you just out for a drive?
- No.
No. We're taking my aunt, to Havana to be buried.
I'm sorry.
You gave up teaching.
No, it's just that we went back to Guantánamo.
But this is a government emergency.
Look, here's the service order.
I'm sorry, young man, but we only take dollars here.
Perhaps further on they can help you.
- Come on.
- Right.
I behaved like a kid.
The last time I saw her,
I slipped a note inside her book, and then I never saw her again.
I never went back to the University.
That must have been... three years ago.
She remembered my name.
Sounds like one of those
TV soap operas.
Don't take offence, mate, but it's true.
I was mad about that woman.
She was your teacher, then?
- What subject?
- Economics.
So she knows how to get out of this mess, right?
Socialist political economics was what she taught me.
But don't get the idea she was dogmatic. Quite the opposite.
Her classes were...
Besides, what she said made you think.
She got into real trouble for it.
Because there was another teacher there who really was obsessive.
She taught scientific communism.
- What?
- Just imagine.
Explain.
Well, she talked about what paradise would be like.
The land of plenty.
Good grief!
Now I believe they call it scientific socialism.
Any day now they'll be calling it scientific capitalism.
That's a good one!
How far are you going, pal?
Bayamo and then Las Tunas.
I have to pick up some goods.
All aboard for Las Tunas!
- Look, nice and ripe.
- How much?
- Only fifty per kilo.
- I'll take a bunch.
No, the price is in dollars.
Fifty bucks a kilo, boss.
Give me some.
There you are.
Thanks.
Have one, Georgina.
- Music Man.
- Thanks.
Thanks.
Your change, friend.
Thank you very much.
Here, Adolfo.
Tony!
Tony!
Would you mind very much turning off the radio?
- Okay, Music Man, sorry.
- Just a minute, Tony.
I only asked if he'd mind turning the music off.
I don't think it's the best moment for celebrating.
Well, I'll be...!
Give 'em an inch and they take a mile.
Adolfo, please!
Okay, Cándido, okay.
I only had the radio on to hear the weather forecast.
I'm upset about Aunt Yoyita, too.
But if everybody starts doing what they feel like, where will it all end?
Okay, no problem.
Turn it off.
During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries,
Bayamo was the most important smuggling centre on the island.
In this way they made a mockery of restrictions and the rigid trade monopoly of the Spanish Crown, which stifled economic growth.
Illegal trade with the
English, French and...
Illegal trade with the
English, French and Dutch was practised by all the locals, including the administrative, military and religious authorities.
Their dealings with the
Protestants, branded as heretics, not only influenced economic growth, but also affected cultural and political life.
Through this channel, the doors were opened for books banned by the Inquisition and the liberal and progressive ideas of the time.
It was no coincidence that Bayamo was the first city to rise in arms against the colonial domination which was stifling the development of the country.
Close it up.
- The toilet?
- At the back on the right.
I'm going to have some coffee made.
There's no snack today.
Adolfo, I've been thinking.
This system costs the same.
The mileage is the same.
But the use of resources is economically fairer, and in accord with the national planning system.
Adolfo, I'm an economist.
Don't you realize, then, that invoicing the critical route guarantees company management at all levels?
Moreover, it makes for a better distribution of the social product, not to mention more efficient statistical records.
You may be an expert economist, but administration has you beat.
What about the sufferers?
The dead don't suffer.
And as for the living...
Okay.
You know best.
Look, Gina.
You know what this could mean for me.
For us.
You know how important appearances are in this country.
Statistics...
Give me a break for once!
Cándido...
Cándido, please, don't take any notice of Adolfo.
He's under a lot of strain.
This relay system was his idea, and he thinks that, if it works, he might win back their confidence.
You know that someone who got as far as he did only to be assigned the job of undertaker...
It's not easy.
- Shall we have a drop of coffee?
- No.
I'll bring you one anyway.
Cándido, your coffee.
Do you not feel well, Cándido?
Let's go outside.
I'll take your coffee.
Let's go out for some fresh air.
Hey, hey!
Be careful!
Watch out!
Idiot!
Hey!
What's the matter?
- What's wrong?
- My wife's in labour.
- Bloody hell!
- Oh, blessed St. Barbara!
- Speak to my boss.
- Not in there, woman!
Not in that car, in this one.
Can you take us to Bayamo?
But we're on our way to Las Tunas.
We've just come from Bayamo.
She can't wait.
Bayamo isn't far.
But this is a funeral, a funeral...!
And they're having a baby.
A birth!
Blessed
St. Barbara. Help!
Hey, Adolfo, it's not the car's fault.
It's okay, calm down.
Adolfo, we're taking her!
Hang on, baby!
Get into the hearse and wait for us in Las Tunas.
Come on! I've got to take this woman. Come on!
Take it easy.
Hang on, baby, hang on!
You're crazy!
- I didn't need a lift to Havana.
- Listen, let me explain.
Because I've found someone forty times the man you are.
Do you hear? I don't need you!
Bastard! Do you hear?
- I don't need you!
- Shit!
- Fucking hell!
- Hey, cut it out!
That'll teach you to have more respect.
To the hospital!
Let's see.
That needs stitching. It looks really bad. Yes, to Bayamo.
I'll unhook the trailer and go back to Bayamo. I'll be back in an hour.
- No...
- I'll be back in an hour!
If you don't like the idea, walk!
Press to stop the bleeding.
S.O.S. Can you hear me? Over.
Patrol here. Identify
yourself. Over.
We have an emergency.
A woman in labour.
This is special service car N°13 from the base in Guantánamo.
From the American naval base
in Guantánamo? Over.
No, from the city of Guantánamo...
From the special service taxi base N°13.
Listen, we're on the Las Tunas-Bayamo road, heading for Bayamo. Over.
I read you.
Take it easy.
Take it easy!
You're bloody joking!
State exact position. Over.
Well, she's in the back seat.
Where? Repeat, please.
Six miles from Bayamo, on the highway. Over.
Don't lose your patience, miss.
Yamilé, she's called Yamilé.
The daughter of Tomás the islander.
We'll send an escort.
Be patient. Over.
- Pant!
- Pant, pant!
Careful with the baby!
Hey, doc!
She looks just like me.
She's just like me, driver.
Thanks, mate.
Hey, Mariano, let's go, okay?
Pardon me for saying so, but it's a relief to be free of your husband.
I'm as honest as I am ugly, and now that we're alone, as the saying goes,
I've a proposition to make.
Up ahead, I've got a friend who runs a "paladar", a clandestine inn.
It's a clean, decent place, and for one peso we can eat a great amarillo with pork.
I've got a few bucks on me, so three can eat as well as one.
Thanks, Tony, but I've got some dollars too.
The problem is, if we're late back,
Adólfo will hit the roof.
If he can wait for important things, he can wait for this.
Adolfo needn't find out.
Besides, he's half an hour ahead of schedule.
He said. So himself.
Believe me,
Adolfo is capable of taking us to Havana on just two bananas.
Come on, Cándido.
In you go.
Paco!
Paco!
- What brings you here, brother?
- Customers.
We need a pork amarillo on the double.
On the double!
Okay. Raulito!
Put a cloth on this table.
Come in.
Get my seat ready.
Here you are.
- How much?
- 25. Genuine article.
Twenty... and a few bananas.
You're like Yoyita.
In name only.
We're both called Georgina.
There's something else,
I don't know but...
You really loved her, didn't you?
She had such a desire to live!
She?
Or you?
Hey, be careful! Go gently!
- Handle it with care!
- It slipped, boss.
Can't you do this some other time?
Don't worry.
This is straighforward.
We'll have the changeover done in ten minutes.
Everything was going fine, but now my plan's gone to pot.
Listen,
Justo rang and I told him you'd left for Camagüey.
Hey, don't get worked up.
You've had problems with your blood pressure already.
Come on, let's have a coffee.
If it hadn't been for that bloody baby...!
Excuse me, I'll wait for you outside.
- You've hardly touched your food.
- Neither have you.
We old people get by on little.
Loneliness is the worst sort of hunger.
Oh, Cándido, you're not alone.
People are really fond of you.
Besides, you've got your memories of Aunt Yoyita.
You know, all my life I've been waiting for a miracle.
I thought that some day I'd get to play in the Symphony Orchestra.
Maybe I was afraid to look fate in the eye. Who knows?
Yoyita became famous, but me...
Stuck in Gantánamo, with my saxhorn!
Oh, Cándido!
Damn it!
Fifty years putting off a trip to Havana!
My life kept getting smaller and smaller my friends started dying, or left the country.
It's always other people who die.
You never think about death until one fine day, there it is, right under your nose.
Are you people coming to eat?
- No, we brought our own food.
- Okay, I'll only be ten minutes.
- How's things?
- Hey, how's things?
- How's business?
- Quiet.
- We'll liven it up for you.
- Come on in.
What happened to you?
Professor!
Mariano!
Cándido, look, it's Mariano.
- Don't get up. How do you do.
- How do you do.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
I'm not a professor now, just Gina.
The food's good here, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Do you feel ill?
- No, no...
If you'll excuse me...
I'm just going to the toilet.
What a coincidence!
Meeting three times in the same day after so long without seeing each other!
Yes, it's odd.
Why were you at the hospital?
Nothing...
- Mi colleague had an accident.
- Really?
Yes, we ran into a... a cow in the road.
But it was nothing serious.
He just bumped his forehead.
- Why were you there?
- Another accident.
But different. I was with a girl who gave birth to a lovely daughter.
But, weren't you going to a funeral?
Well, there you are...
Some depart and others arrive.
That's life, right?
Gina, do you still teach?
Don't be so formal.
Do you still teach?
No.
I got tired of hitting my head against a brick wall.
Shame!
But still, you're an intelligent woman with millions of opportunities.
Thanks.
It's not the end of the world, is it?
And in the end, I reckon the brick wall yields.
- Do you think so?
- Yes.
You...
You know that better than anyone.
Do you remember? Everything changes, everything evolves.
Dialectics!
I'm so glad I bumped into you.
It was me who bumped into you.
I shouldn't have written that note.
But I had to tell you somehow.
Mariano, please.
Yes, forgive me, but...
So you became an engineer!
Tell me all about it.
Gina...
I'd write you the same note.
I must leave.
It was a beautiful letter.
God, I...!
Careful there, gently does it!
Goodness!
You've got the best car in the country.
We should be on the road by now.
Where the devil are those people?
Calm down! You're not going to put out a fire!
THE TIME HAS COME
TO PRESERVE OUR DREAMS.
About bloody time!
Where have you been?
- Come in and have something to eat.
- No, thank you. Here.
- What's this?
- A snack I bought you in a café.
Come on, let's get going!
Gina, come on!
When a flower wilts and dies,
another springs up in its place.
And if a love is lost,
Life takes on another love.
Mariano remembers Gina,
Gina remembers Mariano.
It needn't be a barren memory
the one which springs up
between them.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
The deceased's sister and niece have been calling from Havana.
They're concerned about the delay.
What do they expect? We've stuck to the original plan exactly.
- We're in Camagüey as scheduled.
- Now comes the difficult bit.
Camagüey to Santa Clara.
With a brief stop in Sancti Spíritus.
Remember!
That bitch Paula's there!
There are people in the cafeteria pretending to be bereaved.
Can't you sort it out?
Are you all asleep?
One moment, your ticket.
- Haven't you got a ticket?
- Just a minute.
There's a sign here that clearly says this café is only for mourners.
- I'm a mourner.
- So am I.
Is that so?
Well, I'm not having it.
Listen, here the snacks and the coffee are ordered in advance.
And its all paid for by the close relatives.
Excuse me, what's the problem, sir?
My uncle died last week but nobody gave me a free snack!
- We all have the same rights here.
- Yes, no more privileges!
Anyone would think this was...!
Comrades, comrades!
I've been waiting ages and they've not given me anything.
I have a ticket and I'm entitled.
I know my rights.
Everybody out!
You too.
You too.
I want everybody out!
Now! The cafeteria's closed.
That's the way to do it!
Dead dogs don't bite.
I've got used to it.
It's the best way.
You suffer less.
You have your whole life ahead of you.
Ah, Cándido!
I think I missed my chance without even noticing.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
How do you recognize it?
It all happens so fast.
You feel it.
It's something special, like... having and itchy jaw.
Has yourjaw never itched?
Cándido, I'm a married woman!
You're blind, that's what you are.
Ramón, how are you?
Oh, darling, I've been waiting.
Oh, my sweet, I love you.
What took you so long?
Hey, honey, listen.
- I can't stay. I'm pushed for time.
- Yes, come one down.
Hey, give me that. I can't!
Give me that back.
Listen, the lorry broke down and I really haven't got time!
Let's go to the house and I'll do something that you'll just love.
- Come on!
- Come here, love. I'm not joking.
Hey, listen.
I've been thinking, it's about time I took life seriously.
I'm so glad, honey.
I've been thinking the same
We should live together and be happy.
Let's go to the house,
I want to do things to you.
Come on, baby...
- What's up?
- Let's go to the house.
Ramón, we'll be right back.
Be good.
Hey, honey, what's your hurry?
Hey, what's going on?
Where's the linesman?
- Honey, get dressed, we've no time.
- After this, you'll never forget me.
I love you.
- Come to me.
- We haven't time.
I love you, come...
- I've got to go!
- I'll say things I've never said.
Linesman!
Listen! They're calling you.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
What's the matter?
What! Raise this barrier right now.
There isn't a train in sight.
Wait there, I'm coming!
Why all the hurry?
Get this jalopy rolling.
Come on, men, let's go.
Oh, my love, these people never leave you in peace.
God! The train!
Hilda!
Hilda!
Hilda!
Hey, move that.
Are you mad?
Mad about you, my love.
I'm not moving until you give me a kiss.
Besides, look!
Look what I've got you!
Mammee apple!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hail Mary, God Almighty! Why won't they let me finish with you?
Don't budge, baby.
I'm going to do something to you that you'll love.
- Hey, what's that all about?
- Oh, it's...
It's nothing. Don't get jealous.
I'm all yours, you know that.
I'm crazy about you.
Open up, open up!
Adolfo!
Now what's wrong?
The fan belt's broken.
- You've got a spare, haven't you?
- I haven't got anything.
- Why the bloody hell not?
- What about you?
Have you got a spare liver, eh?
You're going to need it!
We must do something.
- That's more like it!
- Now! I want clockwork precision.
We're 15 miles from Camagüey,
90 miles from Sancti Spíritus.
You, go with me. You, in the Volga.
I must sort this out with Rivero.
You, watch the car.
Hey!
- What's the problem, mate?
- The fan belt's gone.
Why didn't you say?
I've got a spare one.
I always carry one in the back of the lorry.
Let's see what size it is.
- I'll go and fetch one.
- Good man!
What are you doing? No, no!
Heaven forbid! Me, charge you?
Take advantage of this situation?
You can have it. Put that away.
Thanks, son.
Let me pass!
Let me pass!
I'm leaving.
I've got to get back to work.
That's just about got it.
You can start it now.
Me?
Gina!
Mariano!
You asshole!
- What are you doing with her?
- Listen, calm down, calm down!
What's up?
- I'll kill you!
- Calm down, there's been a mix-up.
We're going, Cándido.
Get in.
- Where to? Get in where?
- In the car! Get in the car!
- This one?
- Yes!
- What's the matter, Gina?
- Nothing.
Nothing's the matter.
You really dropped me in it with that jalopy.
Listen, Adolfo, while you've got that car, I have to bury my dead with a horse drawn carriage.
What planet are you living on?
You're responsible for this disaster, and you have to find a solution!
I haven't got a fan belt for that car!
- Get it into your thick head!
- Look for one, then!
- Look where?
- Take one from another car.
This is sabotage! And the consequences could be serious!
Listen a minute, Adolfo.
Let's find a solution.
You know I'm no amateur in this.
I've got a clean record...
What happened?
Nothing, he found a fan belt and...
Come on, Cándido.
Get in there.
We'll use the hearse and have it sent back to Rivero later.
Come on, let's not waste any more time.
- What's up?
- The usual. A corpse.
- It has to be buried in Cárdenas.
- So what?
I've no more hearses! We're in a state of necrological alert here!
But if they say he lived here, why don't they bury him here?
Old man Orlando stated in his will that if he died in Cárdenas, he was to be buried in Sancti Spíritus, and if he died in Sancti Spíritus, he was to be buried in Cárdenas.
What for?
Just to fuck someone up.
And you're that someone.
Do you know what this means?
We'll have to dovetail the services.
But I've got to get to Havana!
And old Orlando to Cárdenas.
The law is the same for everyone.
But this is something unexpected.
Death is always unexpected.
You should know that, from yourjob.
- Where's the office, please?
- Up there.
Thank you.
Adolfo, what did the old lady die of?
Being a whore.
At her age she starts having it off
- with a ridiculous old man...
- I won't stand for that!
Listen, I didn't...
Have some respect for the dead!
Have a good trip.
That was quite ajob!
Okay, Susi, remember about next week.
Okay, big boy.
Next week they're bringing me the black beans and turkeys I ordered.
Take care, and don't get lost, okay?
- Why should I want to do that?
- I love you.
You're such a sweetie.
Look after the pig, okay?
- And look after yourself.
- Yes. Let's go.
What's up now, Ramón?
Get out.
- What?
- I said get out.
What for?
Because we need to fill up with petrol, Mariano, and who's in the next petrol station? Wina!
Your women are too aggressive.
I don't want any part of it.
No, man. Wina's no problem.
I'm the one who's in a mess!
Why?
No reason. Let's get going.
Hey, come on, brother. I told you, there won't be any hassle.
Oh, Mariano, shit...
Mariano!
What?
I have to talk to you about...
What's up, Mariano?
No, nothing.
Well, yes...
I like you a lot.
- Well...
- Mariano,
I got married two weeks ago.
You're kidding!
Fuck me!
That's great...!
Don't pretend, Mariano.
You came to ditch me.
Me?
Yes, you.
How's things?
Fine.
Let's have a coffee.
Ramón!
Come and have a coffee.
Come and have a coffee.
No, it's okay, thanks.
Come on, there's no problem.
Come on!
Wina!
Have you got a pen?
What's up now, Mariano?
Hey, wait there, brother.
Hey!
I'm sorry, but I'm going on alone.
I'm so ashamed.
It was all so unpleasant.
Why? It has nothing to do with you.
- You don't belong with that animal.
- Don't be like that.
Pay no attention to him. Don't you realize that he's insensitive?
It's because he is insensitive that you don't belong with him.
I'm the one who feels sad really sad, when I see how you're throwing your life away on that man.
- It's not fair!
- Oh, Cándido.
There are times in life when you have to make decisions.
I've made mine.
Oh, look.
It's the deceased's granddaughter.
Thanks to them
I'll get to Cárdenas.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
Pleased to meet you.
Take care.
Great care.
- Bye.
- See you soon.
- Gina.
- Yes?
I don't like to interfere, but I was just passing...
What's up? Talking again?
Come on. We've wasted enough time. Gina. Come on.
Well, we'll be seeing you.
Make sure you tell Paula.
You should never tread on
your neighbour's feelings,
because the wind
will blow away
that sort of behaviour.
What has your life been,
Adolfo?
Without principles,
without decency,
with no respect for love,
it's a lost battle.
Guantanamera,
guajira guantanamera,
guantanamera,
- The body for Cardenas is yours.
- No.
I said this was madness from the start, and no one listened.
Now the facts have proved me right.
In no time at all, three funerals have passed through here, one for Cienfuegos, another for Aguada de Pasajeros, and the third for Sancti Spíritus.
The corpse bound for Cárdenas is all yours!
I pioneered this operation, and I do the calculations.
My funeral gets priority.
Well, whether you like it or not,
I can't separate the funerals because I've only got one hearse left.
This isn't over yet! I'm taking it up with the pertinent authorities.
Take it to the top, if you like.
I'm as happy with a funeral as a homage.
You say he'd never had a sick day in his life?
The poor thing was full of life.
He liked walking, horse riding, climbing hills...
He didn't want to die and... just look...
- How are you?
- So, so...
The day of his 107th birthday, the photographer asked him to step back from the camera, to get a better photo.
A bit further back, a bit further...
But he didn't know he was on the edge of a precipice.
It's my first visit to Santa Clara.
- I've never visited anywhere.
- Oh, Cándido!
Look!
Just like Yoyita's dress.
Remember?
Yes, we bought it together.
Yes.
Well, it would look lovely on you.
- Hi, Tony.
- Hello.
Do you sell soft drinks?
We've only got tea and rum.
- Would you like a tea, Cándido?
- Okay...
Two teas.
Just a minute, I'll be right back.
Listen, friend, you can't fit two coffins in this hearse without damaging them.
We'll have to wait for the hearse from Camagüey.
How long will that take?
An hour, an hour and a half.
No way. We're in a real hurry.
Let's try a little harder, push a bit harder.
A bit more... push, push!
It's coming! That's got it!
There!
Gina!
You look like a whore with your hair loose.
I don't trust that old man.
You're to stop talking to him.
And you can change that dress right now!
Listen when I'm talking!
Keep out of it, old man.
Who do you think you are?
Stop!
- Let her go, dammit!
- What the...!
Come on, mate.
I told you,
I'm tired of telling you...
You enjoy looking for trouble.
In the beginning
Olofin made man and woman
and gave them life.
Olofin made life,
but he forgot to make death.
The years passed
and the men and women
got older and older,
but they did not die.
The Earth filled up with people
who were thousands of years old,
and who still ruled according
to their ancient laws.
The young people
clamoured such that
one day their cries
reached the ears
of Olofin.
Olofin saw that the world
was not as good as he had
planned.
He felt
that he also was
too old and tired
to begin again
what had turned out so badly.
So Olofin called lkú
to take care of the matter.
And lkú saw
that it was time to put
an end to the era
in which people did not die.
So lkú caused it to rain
upon the earth for 30 days
and 30 nights without end,
and all was covered
with water.
Only
the children and the young were
able to climb the giant trees
and climb the highest mountains.
The whole Earth became
a huge river with no banks.
The young people then saw
that the Earth was cleaner
and more beautiful,
and ran to give thanks to lkú
for putting and end
to immortality.
They told me the one on the right.
- That one has to go to Havana.
- No, this is the right one.
The one on the right is this one, old man.
We're not going to spend all day here arguing.
One has a blue ribbon attached.
It's the other one.
This one?
Exactly.
Excuse me, miss.
When's the next bus to Havana?
Ticket sales are suspended until tomorrow.
Thank you.
Hello, Adolfo.
How was the journey?
Look, this is the car.
This is your driver.
I'll send you some men right away to help with the changeover.
I've a terrible headache.
Do you have an aspirin?
Certainly, madam.
Follow me to the office.
Come on, Adolfo.
I know how uncomfortable these journeys can be.
Brother, I need a favour.
I've come from the East and
I've got the boot full of stuff.
I tell you, madam, they'll have to give your husband a medal when he gets to Havana.
Gina!
Forgive me, I didn't know what I was doing.
Don't be like this, not now when I need you most.
There are 60 miles left to Havana.
Change that dress.
Back in Guantánamo, everything will be just as it was.
Nothing will be the same now.
I know you too well.
And I'm tired of not thinking.
If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
Everyone makes mistakes.
That radio show José Luis keeps offering me, I'm going to accept.
A radio programme?
On youth guidance?
You weren't even capable of bringing up your own bloody daughter.
I'm fed up of your blaming me for Niurka's going to Miami!
Who was it who let her hang around with those hairy pseudo-intellectuals and listen to their songs?
Who let her read magazines about
"perestroika" and all that shit?
Oh, Adolfo!
Remember the things she came out with?
For the first time I had to raise my hand to her.
My own daughter!
Of course she bloody left, after you poisoned her mind!
Niurka didn't leave because of her friends, or the songs, or what she read.
She left because she had to do all those things in secret.
- And she was fed up of that!
- No!
Wait! I let you have your say, now it's my turn.
Yes, you're right.
Who am I to to give guidance to anyone?
If I take on that programme, as I want to, it's not to tell anyone what to think.
Far be it from me to give anyone instructions!
You don't know me at all.
As for the dress,
I'm not changing it.
It's there in the back.
Cover it with the flowers.
Shit! This is going to be a problem.
Put it here, and if it lifts its head, just push it down again.
Here.
A gift.
Come on, old timer.
So they dropped you like a hot potato in the middle of the road?
No.
I left of my own accord, to get away from that animal.
It seems some people put up with him very well.
Listen, old man.
I need a favour.
When you see Gina, tell her I want her to forgive me.
I get into all sorts of trouble for not minding my own business.
Why not ask her yourself, son?
See what she says.
I hope I never bump into that woman again.
The name's Ramón.
Just ask for me at work.
Help him down, Mariano.
Be careful, there.
Well, son...
Take care.
Cándido!
I'll give you a written report tomorrow.
But I can tell you now, we saved no less than sixty litres of petrol and two days expenses in cash.
Any trouble on the way?
There are always problems, but there are always solutions, too.
In Sancti Spíritus I put the two coffins for Cárdenas together.
Here's the order.
Here it is.
Shit!
What's wrong?
Cándido, please...
- The ladder.
- Yes.
Dear friends, families of the deceased.
On this morning we are united by a great sorrow.
Two very dear people are no longer with us.
Out of love, and only love, they have crossed the threshold of silence which leads us to immortality.
We are here today to say farewell to two unforgettable people, two lovers who, across time and space, kept their hearts united.
Two beings, consecrated to love,
Aunt Yoyita, as her nearest and dearest affectionately called her, and that fine fellow, Cándido, the generous musician who often cheered our Sundays from the bandstand in our distant hometown,
Guantánamo.
They lived the most sublime moments of love.
For years, only their memory kept alive the flame of that love...
A love which grew in their hearts, until, suddenly, both hearts burst as one in a flood of happiness, joy and immaculate glory.
In that one moment they touched the bounds of eternity.
Death unites them today in an imperishable embrace.
Those who die of love bequeath a lesson, at their passing, to those of us who remain, disconsolate and somewhat Ionelier on this side of the threshold.
That lesson, my friends, teaches us that love is the salt of life.
It is our task to follow the path which they trod, hand in hand like two lovers in search of eternal bliss.
Hey, listen!
Don't go!
Wait! I haven't finished my speech.
Help!
Don't leave me here alone!
Help!
The ladder!
Bring me the ladder!
''In the Name of God''
BARAN
-I win. I win!
-Wait for me.
Ten packs of pasta, four boxes of matches seven packs of Harvardin cigarettes... eight packs of Montana cigarettes.
Your name?
You always ask me.
I can't remember every name.
Lateef.
Look at my fortune.
Mr. Hossein, take good care of my ID card.
Remind Memar to send me some money.
Sure.
It's 3,480 tomans.
And with this candy, it makes 3,500 tomans.
Go ahead, help yourself!
Thanks a lot.
Don't forget to tell Memar.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Put him down here!
Where does it hurt?
Is it real bad?
We're taking you to the hospital right now!
What happened?
It's Najaf.
He fell from the second floor.
He jumped without his parachute?
Shame on you!
Get the hell back to your work!
Put him up in the truck!
Now, all of you, back to work!
Come on!
Take him to the hospital!
Don't mention the address here!
I don't want any trouble with the inspectors.
Soltan, be careful! Go!
Mr. Engineer, stop flashing this light. I am going blind.
I don't know what's wrong.
Hey, Chief, this is the bill that Memar is sending you.
He hasn't even paid the wages and he is sending me a bill!
Don't get excited!
Go down and get the wages for the workers.
Unbelievable!
Mr. Engineer, are you still playing with the light?
Mind your own business!
You badly need a flash of genius.
Get lost!
Hey, Chief, this is your bill.
Memar tells you to come down to get the workers' wages.
50,000 tomans and the account is okay.
You are squeezing the hell out of me!
There are plenty of other workers!
Ask my own fellow countryman if he got anything.
The money I've still got is for the Afghan workers.
Iranian workers are more important than Afghans!
My God, in life you must be fair.
They come every day all the way from Kan Sulerun.
They work more than Iranian workers for much less money.
Look at poor Najaf who fell today.
He is laid up at home with broken bones.
Now in all conscience:
To whom should I give the money, to them or to you?
To us!
Enough! You're hopeless!
Please stop speaking Turkish.
Speak Farsi so I can answer you!
Okay for Farsi! Do you know what it means to have feelings?
-If you have feelings...
-No, you don't know.
...you give each worker his daily wage or a contract.
-So, you want a contract?
-Yes.
Okay, now take this money, and you this and get the hell out of here.
Now what?
When will you give me some money?
Your wife and kids are starving?
Your wife wants a divorce?
Your money is safer with me than in a bank... and I also give you pocket money.
I'd prefer to take care of it myself.
Kid, you think you're smart, don't you? Sit down!
Okay, take it, kid.
Come on, take it!
When I said you're not smart, that's what I mean.
What do you wanna do with this money?
Take this and it's already too much.
You're young. You're a kid.
You aren't able to make any savings.
Now, go and get the fuel to fill up the lamps.
Memar, that's a bill to settle.
Lateef, what are you doing?
Hurry up with the fuel!
I am coming. I am coming.
-Where is Memar?
-Upstairs!
Good morning, Memar.
Is that a time to come to work?
It is almost noon!
Sorry I am late.
I dropped by Najaf's house.
Wait here. I'll be back.
Who is he, your kid?
No, Najaf's kid.
Any news of Najaf? How is he?
His foot is badly broken and he is at home.
Today, don't work.
I'll pay your wage.
This money is for Najaf.
God bless you, Memar.
There's no rush.
This evening,
I'll drop by his house.
Najaf, in his state, can't work.
He's got five children to feed and his wife passed away last year.
His son could replace him.
Have you already worked in construction?
A bit, but mostly he was taking care of his brothers and sisters.
What can you do?
This boy is smart.
He'll catch up very quickly.
Can't he speak for himself?
Kid, what can you do?
I hope he isn't deaf and dumb.
I said what work can you do?
It isn't a big deal to carry cement sacks.
You're right, but it takes strength and this kid looks too weak.
One or two days, and he'll be okay.
What is your name?
Rahmat.
All right, I take him on trial for two to three days.
-Let him work with you.
-God bless you.
Where have you been since the morning?
I was doing the shopping.
Hurry up, serve tea to the workers.
That's what I'm doing.
How come you thought of serving me tea today?
I saw you in a nightmare.
Soltan, this is your boy?
No. This is Rahmat, the son of Najaf.
Oh, Najaf is dead?
God forbids!
He's home with a broken foot.
I was only joking.
Najaf and I are good friends.
Have some tea.
-Come on, have some tea!
-Rahmat, have some tea.
Hey, this tea is from yesterday?
No, from last week.
Of course it's from today.
Then why are you giving me this dishwater?
Get yourself a private servant!
What the hell is yourjob here?
Shut your big mouth!
You think you're so strong?
What is going on?
Get the hell back to your work!
Back to your work!
Memar, Memar, the government inspectors are coming.
The inspectors are coming!
Afghans, run, all of you hide!
The inspectors are here!
Hide yourselves. Hurry up, run!
Hello, sir. Welcome!
Memar, we heard that an Afghan worker fell from this building.
Afghan?
We haven't any Afghans here.
It was one of my fellow countrymen.
Where is he now?
He went from the hospital back to his village.
You don't have any Afghan working here?
No, sir.
Do you know what it means if you employ Afghans without an authorization?
Yes.
So, now that you know the law, read this paper and sign it.
-What's that?
-A letter of compliance.
-Please.
-How many Afghans work here?
One.
Oh yeah? Who's he? Where's he?
You're looking at him.
You think you're funny?
I work more than the Afghans and I am treated like dirt.
Enough bullshit, big mouth!
Get lost!
Please.
Hey, you signed it, right?
Yes.
My respects.
Welcome any time.
-Is there anyone there?
-No, there's no one.
Okay, let's get out of here.
Don't worry. Come.
How was his work?
Not bad for a first day.
Hey, give this to Najaf.
That's kind of you.
Bye.
Memar, is there any for me?
You can't get your eyes off from the money.
Bring tea. Go.
When he sees money, his tongue hangs out.
Memar, the account is not correct.
Some money is missing.
I know, I know.
First you fix the walls, then I'll give you the rest.
What are you doing?
This one is heavy.
Turn... bend a bit... further back.
A few days and you'll get used to it.
Then you'll carry loads better than a mule.
Oh! Stupid kid, where's your head?
Oh, my God. I'm getting blind.
I hope this place will soon collapse!
It's become a nursery.
Any kid who shows up gets a job!
Here comes the abominable snowman.
Have some hot tea.
It will melt the snow.
You stupid moron!
Hey! Wait, there!
What the hell's going on?
Go back to your work!
What have you done with yourself?
I was going down the stairs when I felt that damn plaster falling on me.
I looked up and it was that Afghan kid.
He's not fit for this work and then this idiot is trying to be funny!
That's enough.
Go back to your work.
Kid, come down here.
No need to work anymore!
Don't worry. Come down.
You Afghan, it is all your fault.
Memar, may I say something?
Don't you see I haven't got any time?!
Memar, please don't send Rahmat away!
How many times do I have to tell you the kid isn't fit for this kind of work.
It is all my fault.
I've gone too fast with him.
One more word and I'll throw you out, too.
Foreman Faraj, how many more bricks do you need?
Go and pick up your stuff from the room.
As of tomorrow, you'll work with Faraj.
If you don't want to work
I'll settle your account and you're out.
-I didn't do anything.
-Do as I said.
I don't feel like arguing with you.
You're no good as a worker.
Can you prepare tea, cook, and wash dishes?
If you can, then you stay.
Otherwise,
I don't need you here.
Shopping is now your responsibility.
Come here, kid.
Take Rahmat to the places where you do the shopping.
Introduce him to the Dariani shop owner.
Tell him to bring his own
ID card to give to Dariani.
He's got no ID card.
That's not my problem!
I'll get my card back!
Hell, get it! You think it is such a precious shit?
You're right!
In the past months, that's what has fed your stomachs.
Kid, don't play this game with me.
Get lost, stupid animal!
It's my mistake to try to make a man out of you!
Why the hell are you standing here staring at me?
Come on, clear off!
I'm warning you, Afghan!
You're taking my job and one day
I'll smash your nose into your brain!
-Thanks, Rahmat.
-Finally a real tea!
A good change from Lateef's dishwater!
This is for you.
I don't need it.
I'm not in a wheelchair!
Well done, Rahmat.
The food's great.
Smart kid.
Well done, Rahmat.
You're doing a greatjob.
Who told you to put your disgusting hands on my shirt?!
You're messing it up!
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Soltan.
-Hello. How are you doing?
-Fine, thanks.
You're alone?
Rahmat isn't coming?
He is. There was no more bread in the bakery. He had to wait.
Hey, kid, you're not working today?
I am.
So, why are you dressed like a pop star?
Why not? It's very possible to work with these clothes. See?
-What's the hurry?
-Nothing.
-Go upstairs with this worker.
-I'm busy.
There is a wall to knock down.
Go, I tell you!
Kid, come on, move.
You've got no brain! I told you
I want Montana cigarettes!
What are these lousy cigarettes you got me? Take them back!
Cigarettes are all the same.
They go up in smoke.
He's got hundreds of things to do.
He is no servant of yours.
And what has it got to do with you, moron?
Is your face in need of a quick fix?
You want to fix it?
What about smashing your nose to the back of your skull?
Just get lost, will you, moron!
What's going on?
Lateef, you're like a fighting cock always ready to jump and fight!
Stop it! Go back to your work!
Thank you, Rahmat, that's nice.
Thanks for the trouble.
You're kind.
-What is your name?
-Ismael.
One, two, three, four, five.
Take this.
Thank you.
Lateef, close the tap.
Kid, have you got fresh tea?
This isn't a tea room!
Get out of here!
Are you the watchman of the building or what?
I don't feel like beating you up.
So, get back to your work right now or I'll call Memar.
Hey, man, mind your own business!
Memar! Memar!
You're a real dummy.
All right, but remember, one day I'll have my revenge.
Hey, do you work here?
How many Afghans work here?
You're not answering?
Come here.
Go and catch him!
Afghans, run, go and hide yourselves!
The inspectors are here!
Rahmat, go!
Afghans, Afghans.
Since when you're a movie hero?
Why the hell did you get involved?
I could have taken care of it myself.
Because of you, I got a fine and now I must lay off all the Afghans.
You didn't tell me where you disappeared today.
Hey, you're deaf?
What? Are you again after money?
Memar, I have to go to my village for a few days.
My sister is ill.
You're a doctor, now?
Let her father take her to the doctor.
There is work. You can't go.
I don't want any money.
I'll be back soon.
No way! You know what that means-- ''impossible.''
Your father put you under my care.
I make the decisions.
Okay, then settle my account and give it to my father.
I am getting out of here.
You've got a thick head, haven't you?
Now, how many days are you going to be out?
Three, four days.
-Not more!
-Okay.
Hey, kid, come back here.
Take this. You may need it.
-Thanks.
-Say hello to your father.
Without your ID card, it's impossible.
I told you a hundred times,
I have responsibilities.
I'm a stranger in this city.
Today, at my new job, they kept my ID card.
You could repeat this until the morning.
I still need your ID card.
Go, find yourself a place where they won't ask for it.
Go, my dear sir.
Let me get back to my work.
Hey, what do you want?
Have you got your ID card or no?
-Yes.
-Okay, give it to me.
Come and warm yourself.
Please, there is a hole in my shoe. Can you fix it?
Do you live here?
Everyone who meets me, meets me on the road.
Do you know Soltan?
There are many Afghans called Soltan.
He is a construction worker.
All Afghans are builders.
At dawn they go to cities, at dusk they come back home.
Are you living with anyone here?
A man alone is a neighbor of God.
''From the hot fire of being apart comes the flame that burns the heart.''
You speak very well.
These are words from the heart, my son.
Please.
Would you share a piece of bread with me?
Thank you, but I've got to go.
-Good-bye!
-God bless you!
Hey, driver, stop! Stop!
Hello, Soltan.
How are you doing?
-How are you?
-What are you doing here?
Here... some... one of my fellow countrymen lives around here.
I came to visit him.
I am lucky I saw you.
Where are you?
You left us without any news.
I'm looking to earn my bread.
Memar can't hire any Afghans.
Where are you working?
Anywhere I can.
One day here, one day there.
Are you still there?
Yes, I am on my way right now.
What's Rahmat doing?
Where is he?
He works in Kan Sulerun.
It was difficult for him in the city.
Rahmat's work is close to the Shoeb shrine?
Just behind it.
I used to work there.
I know the place.
Come on down. Come on, hurry up.
If you ever are around here, come and see me.
-Okay, Good-bye.
-Good-bye. God bless you.
I told you a hundred times,
I am fed up.
Sir, please don't get upset.
How many times did I tell you to watch what the workers are doing?!
I'll tell them to fix it.
These walls aren't even straight!
It's ridiculous!
There has been a mistake.
It can be corrected.
Don't get upset.
I've just had enough.
God help me, it is not my fault.
Then, do as I told you.
At your service.
Sir, all will be fixed.
Don't expect to see a penny until it is done.
At your service, sir.
Hello.
Foreman Faraj, I told you to watch what's going on!
The walls upstairs must be knocked down.
I've got to go now.
Memar, wait!
Go back to your work!
Memar, wait!
Go back to your work!
I need you.
Where are you going? Wait!
What the hell do you want, kid?
I haven't got any money. See?
Memar, my sister is ill.
I want to send my savings.
Kid, you don't understand what I just said.
Who didn't understand?
Me or you?
I've worked a whole year for what?
To get my money when I needed it.
Now, I badly need it for my sister.
She is killing herself at work.
She is going to die.
Damned the money I have to beg for when it's mine.
Memar, for God's sake.
I swear to God, if you give me the money
I'll work three months without pay.
For God's sake, if I didn't need the money so much
I wouldn't be insisting like this.
Memar, please, please,
I'm desperate.
I need the money, for heaven's sake.
When do you need the money?
Tomorrow, a relative of mine is going to Ardebil.
He'll take the money.
It's a lot of money.
Do you trust him?
Tomorrow morning, I'll bring it.
Now go back to your work.
Where did you get all this money?
These are my wages for a year.
I don't really need it now and Najaf is in big trouble.
With his broken leg, he cannot work.
He can pay me back when he starts working again.
Why don't you give it to him yourself?
I feel embarrassed.
And if he refuses?
Why would he?
Maybe he can't pay you back.
There is no rush-- anytime he can.
If he refuses,
I'll bring it back.
Tomorrow morning I'll wait for you at the Shoeb shrine.
I would like to pay Najaf a visit with you.
Thank you very much.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.
Have you been waiting long?
Hello. I was waiting for Soltan.
-Soltan has gone.
-Gone? Where?
Afghanistan.
When?
Yesterday he came to me.
He had borrowed money from someone and wanted to give it to me.
Did you take it?
No. How could I?
His situation is worse than mine. He is broke.
His wife in Afghanistan has been terribly sick for months and he couldn't afford to go there.
Yesterday night, with God's help, he was able to leave.
Soltan told me to give you this.
It is an address.
Wait, I'll help you.
I don't want to trouble you.
It's no trouble at all.
You shouldn't walk too much with your foot like this.
I've got no choice, my son.
''I swear on our Blessed Imam Reza that I will give you back all your money. Soltan.''
Would you share a piece of bread with me?
Thank you, I've got to go.
Good-bye!
Good-bye!
When are you going back to Afghanistan?
After tomorrow.
If I can gather some money can you take it with you for my brother's children?
More than money, now, they need protection.
As you know, the town of Bamian has fallen.
Women and children have all fled to the mountains.
These are the things we found on your brother's body and a letter he wrote just before he died in the battle.
Any news from his wife and children?
Nothing yet.
What to do? Look at me!
I am useless with my broken foot and we're hardly living off the work of my daughter Baran.
Oh, brother, brother.
Don't cry. God will help.
Write them a letter.
That will be a comfort to them.
Yes, comfort is good, but what about loneliness?
Look who's here! It's Najaf.
What a surprise! How are you?
Who's there? What's going on?
Oh! Najaf, how are you?
Now, you all go back to your work.
Come with me.
Let's sit and talk.
Have some tea.
-I've no choice, Memar.
-Does your foot hurt?
I have so many other pains that
I forget the one in my foot.
Everything will be all right.
Nothing can be all right anymore.
Can I ask you to do something for me?
What is it?
-I am embarrassed.
-Come on, speak out.
If you could lend me some money,
I'll be forever grateful.
The times are hard. I am broke.
The engineer has given me no money.
By God,
I have no one else to turn to.
Please, don't let me down.
Come back in two weeks and I'll see what I can do for you.
I need the money today or tomorrow.
It's impossible.
Memar, I beg you, help me.
You take me by surprise,
Najaf, my friend.
Where can I find this money?
Look, these are my pockets.
Anything in them is yours.
Come, take this!
I am no beggar. I didn't come here to ask for charity.
What are you talking about?
We're friends. Take it!
It's no use. I am leaving.
Good-bye.
Wait, let's see.
What is your last price?
-How much are you ready to pay?
-Ten more.
I'm not selling!
Hey, pal, come here. Come!
Hey! Come on, I tell you!
Are you coming or what?
How much?
How much is this?
I'll give you a good deal.
Excuse me, I have to see Najaf.
Hello.
Hello. Welcome. Come in.
No, thank you, I must go.
What is this for?
The money is from Memar.
He told me to give it to you.
He is sorry he couldn't come himself.
He was busy.
God bless him!
Tell him I'll be forever grateful.
What for? It is his job.
Tell him that when I return
I'll pay him back.
You owe him nothing; he owes you.
He should pay you for the months you couldn't work.
What he is sending you is nothing. You could sue him.
Come on, Memar is a good man.
Tell him that when I come back from Afghanistan
I'll give him back the money.
Afghanistan?
Yes, I am going for sure.
They're waiting for me.
When are you leaving?
Tonight, hopefully,
I'll rent a truck.
Tomorrow, early, we'll load our things and go.
Now, come in and drink an Afghan tea. Come in.
Thank you, I must go. Good-bye.

She was born on December 8th, 1980, at 10:50 p.m.
The exact time
Mark David Chapman killed
John Lennon.
For me, though, that's just a coincidence.
All I care about is that she was born at that exact moment.
Her name:
Lily Chou-Chou.
Genius.
Or rather, genesis.
The Ether personified.
From: philia
Liberating our thoughts for that reason, SHE IS.
The shadows SHE releases into the Ether sublimate its wavelengths, transcend the spectrum, reach the transparent beyond.
A permeating image of pain fills the gaps of serotonin.
From: Cornea
The Ether heals my pain.
From: Dream Child
The things you hold dear... friends, family, lovers... hurt you the most.
You live with that.
That's why we have the Ether.
A place of eternal peace.
That's the Ether.
From: Les Paul
Lily sees something no one else can see.
If that's the Ether, then we must listen to her.
From: Ice
Does anyone else make music from the Ether?
The Beatles, for sure.
From: Ø.
Bjork, for me.
From: P-O-W-E-R
UA!
She cuts right to my soul.
From: Minako
Definitely Ringo Shena.
From: Sakiya
You think Ringo Shena has the Ether?
No way.
Only Lily has the Ether.
From: Sleepy Head
I am the Ether's Chosen One.
The one who guards Lily.
I must carry out my orders and lead fools to the true Ether so they will not err again.
From: Rod
This sounds like a cult.
Can't you live without this Ether?
From: Cuttlefish
I may be wrong, but I don't feel the Ether from Lily.
Am I crazy?
From: Kaiser
I mean, she's just a person.
I mean, like, who the hell is Lily?
From: S
Exactly!
She doesn't do anything for me.
You're all brainwashed.
From: Kaiser
What's this Ether you're all talking about?

"Kingo"?
Is that a name?
Ain't worth shit!
Hey, wait!
Come back!
Run, Clione!
I'm coming!
Smash the alarm!
My parents said it's okay, see?
You know we don't buy hot CDs.
Hot?
Hot... shoplifted, stolen.
But we have to depend on the customer's honesty.
Of course, business is business.
We want the popular CDs, especially the new ones.
These aren't hot.
Excuse me.
Is this for sale?
If you want it, it's yours.
I was gonna toss it anyway.
That's so lame.

They still haven't caught him?
Kids these days are very scary.
Is your boy all right?
Yuichi? He's a good kid.
Has he asked to dye his hair yet?
He hasn't said anything.
But I'd dye it for him if he wanted.
I just realized something.
"Yuichi" and "Shinichi."
"Ichi" means "eldest son."
So we should change
"Shinichi" to "Shin-ji."
I suppose.
Shinichi, you be "Shinji."
No!
Quit complaining!
It's only fair, since Yuichi has to change his last name.
Right?
Hello.

I never knew there was a site like this.

Hello, blue cat.
This is a free zone in the Ether for those who love Lily.

I'm Philia, site manager.
The rule here is you have to love Lily.
That's all.

Don't sleep there.
You'll catch a cold.
Shinichi!
They haven't caught him yet?
Nope. They haven't.

Let's go.
Move it!
They should hang him.
Hey, good night!

Lucky you.

The frequency summoned me.
What is here???
From: M13
A new CD just came out.
From: bancy
Thanks.
I'll buy it tomorrow.
But I have
NO EARS.
From: M13
Boss.
My name is Osanai, from Ayu Junior High.
Thank you for coming over.
He's one of my students.
It's just one CD.
What are you doing?
Why didn't you just buy it?
I'm really sorry about this.
You're his teacher?
He's a Lily Chou-Chou fan.
This rots the Ether, you know.
He used to be a bully.
You don't have to buy that.
No, I wanted it, and I'm here anyway.
I mean, you know, I'm here, so...
Osanai?
Sato?
It is you!
It's been ages!
You work here?
Yeah. And you're a teacher?
That's hard work!
Hey, don't give her a hard time!
You have strange tastes.
Show me.
"Breathe."
"Arabesque."
So you got caught shoplifting.
Was it fun?
Guess not, huh?
Mr. Onda.
She's in the guidance office.
All right!
Is that Chopin?
It's Debussy.
"Arabesque."
The first song on "Breathe,"
"Arabesque," is an homage to Debussy.
"Arabesque"!
Lily says the first to make ethereal music were Debussy and Eric Satie.
But make no mistake...
Lily's Ether is influenced by no one.
Lily was high on the Ether before she ever heard Debussy.
From: philia
Hello.
Oh, I didn't know you were expecting.
You never told me.
I'm sorry to bring you all the way down here in your condition.
I should have gone to see you.
Please, sit down.
That's right. I should've gone to see you tonight.
So I wouldn't have had to skip baseball practice.
Excuse me?
The fact is that Yuichi... was caught shoplifting.
By the way, when is your baby due?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What're you doing?
Take it easy, Mrs. Hasumi!
Let's talk about this.
It was only one CD.
Ms. Osanai went to the record store.
I apologized and cleared his name.
Even if it's just one CD, stealing is stealing.
Well, it's not unusual for kids these days to shoplift.
But overreacting won't solve anything.
Besides, kids these days have a lot of strange ideas.
"In my darkened room, arms around my knees..."
I think he's really sorry.
"That's all I remember," says Lily.
Even one CD.
Stealing is stealing.
Well, that's true.
"Arms around my knees," no TV,
"no music."
Lily says,
"It's always sunset."
As it grows dark, when the air splits in two, sound swells in my head, and the light leaks through.
I don't remember when it started.
"One day it was just there," says Lily.
This was the most important episode in her awakening to the Ether.
If that idiot interviewer hadn't asked her this question, she might have shown more of what's inside of her.
"What music influenced you?"
She didn't answer.
She didn't have to.
She has no need of other music.
She conceives and gives birth to it.
The Ether is the amniotic fluid that nurses her music.
That's all.
From: philia
Hello?
It's me. Hoshino.
Why don't you come out?
Yeah.
"Yeah"? say, "Yes, sir."
You know why we're here, don't you?
You ratted on us, didn't you?
- No.
- Liar!
Tsujii!
Leave that. Come here.
- Get up!
- Pussy!
The band with Lily at its center,
"Philia," on February 21, 1995, reached number one on the charts.
The first song was "Addiction."
But "Philia" broke up...
This guy's a Lily Chou-Chou fan!
Two short years later.
Fucking creepy!
Of them, only "Kamakatsu" has gone on to better things.
Come on!
"Kayama Katsuhiro," or "Kamakatsu," now leads "Yellow Fellows."
Give us a hand.
Hurry!
Take your pants off.
Hurry! Take 'em off!
Your underwear, too.
Yeah, them too. Move it!
- Hurry up!
- Hey! Move it!
- Jerk yourself off.
- Do it!
Spank your little monkey!
Rub yourself raw.
Turn this way so we can watch you.
Fuck!
He's really doing it!
What a pervert!
Skanky! It's making me puke!
- Keep in time!
- Where's your sense of rhythm?
Get over here!
And 1, 2, 3, 4!!
Keep in time, I said!
Hey.
Enough with the rocks.
You'll kill him.
So? Is that a problem?
Let's bail.
I'm getting sick of this.
You two stay here and make sure he comes.
Bring us a sample.
Kamakatsu used the band "Philia" as a stepping stone for his career.
So all of us Lily fans will never forgive him.
From: philia
Please stop now! Go home.
That's enough.
I can't watch this!
That's gross! Stop it!
Let's go.
Please stop!
Lily likens the Ether to colors.
"Breathe" was blue Ether and "Erotic" was red.
From: philia
"Erotic" was a masterpiece!
I still remember the rush I got when I first heard it last year.
From: blue cat
I didn't get to hear it when it came out.
It was only a year ago, but I still didn't know about Lily.
From: philia
Representing the 1st-year students,
Shusuke Hoshino, Class 2.
New students and teachers, stand!
Bow!
As we enter Ayu Junior High, our hearts are filled with hope...
He was Class President at Ayu Elementary.
Why's he representing us?
Hey, Sasaki.
Too bad, huh?
I don't care.
As we help each other and make new friends.
Shusuke Hoshino, 1st year.
13 years old.
You call them rose-colored days, if what you call today is gray.

From Tanago Elementary,
Hitoshi Terawaki!
My hobby is kendo!
Pleasure to be here!
Louder!
From Tanago Elementary!
Class 3, Hitoshi Terawaki!
My hobby is kendo!
Pleasure to be here!
From Iwana Elementary,
Class 5, Kyota Shimizu!
My hobby is Karaoke!
Pleasure to be here!
Okay.
You're next.
From Ayu Elementary...
Speak up!
Ayu Elementary, Shusuke Hoshino.
I hope kendo will make me stronger.
Pleasure to be here.
That's him. Hoshino.
From Ayu Elementary,
Natsumi Murakami.
Well... I admire
Ikeda!
Hey, you can't say that!
Masks!
Come on, Ikeda!
Disturbing practice?
We're not disturbing anything!
We're serious about kendo.
Business is business, and pleasure is pleasure.
- You're mixing it up!
- We're not!
You're cheering for Ikeda.
We're supposed to cheer!
They told us to!
We don't have to take this from you.
You can't make us quit the club.
Are you jealous?
You like one of us?
Or maybe it's Ikeda they like!
- Homo!
- Faggot!
Get out of here!
Hoshino, you really think highly of yourself, don't you?
Almost everyone in school hates you.
Did you know that?
He's such an asshole.
His essence is asshole.
You think winning the marathon means you can brag?
Or that being smart means you're better than us?
Or that making a speech makes you a big shot?
Let's go!
Fuck them!
They're nuts.
I didn't ask to make that speech.
Those girls joined the ping-pong club.
What? They quit kendo?
Now they're cheering for another guy.
Whatever.
I wish they'd been a bit hotter.
There are hardly any hot girls in our grade.
Really?
Yeah.
There were only 20 girls in sixth grade.
The best one was Masumi.
Nice name.
No. She was called "Gorilla."
She had a monkey face.
And she was the prettiest?
In the monkey world, yes.
But junior high's a different world.
It's not only about girls.
I've never seen such smart guys like Hoshino here.
So now I'm almost like a frog out of its pond.
Kendo is sometimes like that too.
The nationals are full of guys you can never beat.
You'd never think they were in junior high.
Are they that good?
He's getting fired up!
An ambitious guy, as usual.
We've never gotten past regionals.
But maybe you guys will do better.
We've got you.
Just leave it to me.
I didn't mean you.
At least let me say it!
I'm going this way.
Thanks for treating.
He's... a nice guy.
Sweetheart?
Help me with this.
A friend?
Hello.
What's all this?
It was on sale.
You loaded it yourself?
Sure did.
What is it?
Dog food.
Is this your room?
You want to take a bath?
I'm fine.
I'm gonna take a quick shower.
I gotta go.
Why? You should sleep over.
What was your name?
Hasumi.
Hasumi? What's your first name?
Yuichi.
Yuichi. So you're the eldest.
Any brothers or sisters?
No.
Really? Another only child.
Why don't you stay for dinner?
I just had some noodles.
You're a growing boy.
You can still have some more.
Why don't you spend the night?
It's Sunday tomorrow.
I'll call your parents.
That's okay.
No, I insist.
Here's pajamas and underwear.
You can use his shampoo and conditioner.
These?
Those are Grandma's.
- These?
- They're mine.
- These?
- Yep. Those are his.
You're adorable, Yuichi.
Can we adopt you?
Guess not, huh?
Sweetheart.
Come give us a hand.
Just leave it open.
- Good night, then.
- Good night.
Is that your sister?
That's my mother, stupid!
That's bullshit!
No, it's not.
You came out of her?
Yeah.
No way!
Yes way.
Before the Big Bang, there was nothing. Amazing, huh?
The beginning of the universe.
It's still expanding.
Do you believe in aliens?
Maybe there're life forms we don't know about.
It'd be strange if there weren't.
Because then what are we?
I'm dubious about UFOs, though.
"Dubious"?
Uncertain.
The evidence isn't reliable.
You're like an alien yourself.
Why?
Because you're so intelligent.
And your mom's so pretty.
Everyone's got me wrong.
What?
I'm not that smart.
You were top student in our year!
No, I wasn't. I was seventh.
I wasn't first.
Be careful of rumors.
They said I came first in the personality test.
You didn't?
Think about it.
You can't come first in a personality test.
Nobody understands me.
But seventh is still pretty awesome.
Then I wish they'd say seventh.
Why first?
Whoever came first thinks I'm lying about it.
Maybe they're calling me a liar behind my back.
Let's go to sleep.
What's that?
Lily Chou-Chou.
I've recently gotten into her.
Someone guided me to Lily.
Someone who liked Debussy.
From: blue cat
Run! Run!
I sat beside her for a long time.
It was in fifth grade, before I changed schools.
Here's the bus!
Ouch! Don't push.
Sorry.
When I changed schools, she gave me
Philia's "Manic & Depressive."
I didn't understand it then.
In junior high I started liking it.
Maybe because I met her there again.
But now we're not even in the same class.
I can never talk to her.
I'm a stranger to her.
I wonder if she still likes Lily.
From: blue cat
I won!
Who said we were trying?
Cool him off a bit!
Hoshino, too!
Why me?
Just because!
You're next!
Go for it!
That girl was hot, huh?
Who?
The one Hoshino bumped into.
- You mean Kuno?
- Kuno?
How do you know her?
I don't know her.
Which one is she?
What Kuno?
- Kuno Kanda?
- That's Uno Kanda!
Kuno is her family name.
Class 1, maybe.
You know her.
No, I don't.
No? You're holding back something.
I really don't know her.
Have you ever heard me talking about her?
Bullshit! Tell us about her.
Why are you freaking out?
She was hot, right?
I'm gonna go ask her.
- Miss Kuno!
- I can't believe he's calling her!
Paging Miss Kuno!
Yes?
What a fucking retard!
This train is bound for "Miss Kuno."
Does he go to your school?
She was right next to me!
Hoshino!
Hoshino!
You! Hoshino!
We meet again, pussy!
Let's kick his ass.
- What are you staring at?
- Look somewhere else.
- Hey, don't look away.
- Which is it?
Can I hit him?
Leave it.
I don't care.
Think fast, dickhead!
- I can't stand your face!
- Beat it!
- What do you want?
- What do you want?
- Asshole!
- Midget!
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off.
You call me a midget?
Yeah. Got a problem with that?
- Asshole. Yes, I do.
- Got a problem, midget?
- Don't yell.
- I'm not yelling.
- You're too fucking loud.
- Too bad.
- What?
- So what?
- You got a problem?
- Yeah, you.
Get out of my face!
He must have been bullied.
From class wimp to class president,
Hoshino's come a long way.
He doesn't seem like the kind of guy you mess with.
Sure he does!
You should see his mother.
She's a babe.
His mother?
She's really hot.
How old is she?
Who cares?
Pretty is pretty.
She looks like...
Who?
Izumi Inamori.
She's like her clone.
When I stayed over, she fed me till I just about burst.
I think it was a ploy.
What do you mean?
Rich people do it all the time.
They feed you so you'll be friends with their kids.
Fight!
Men point!
Match point!
Do we present the flowers first?
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you!
Present the flowers.
Thank you.
Say cheese!
Picture, please!
Say cheese!
Say cheese!
Bow!
Begin!
Fuck this!
I can't do this every day!
"The Charm of the Sea! Sea! Sea!"
The sea!
I want to go!
But there's no way.
10,000 yen, 20,000 yen...
Only 38,000 yen?
That won't get us to Okinawa.
Fuck Okinawa!
Fuck coral reefs!
But I don't want to beg my parents.
I hear you.
They'd never let you forget it.
- And Play Station 2's coming out.
- Really?
So we gotta be patient this summer.
It plays DVDs.
Wow! What's a DVD?
We can't go to Okinawa with our money.
My folks will be all, "No way."
- "You can't go for 100 years."
- "Go to the public pool."
Money! Money! Money!
Any ideas?
We can get a job. Manual labor!
- Delivering papers.
- Delivering milk.
That's hard work!
- Picking pockets!
- That's hard time!
A Porsche!
The guy's rich!
Now what?
- I can't do it.
- You go then.
Nice car you got there!
Give us your money!
Quick!
Cut it out!
A holdup!
Cool!
There's nothing in here!
Not that!
He's loaded!
Give me that!
Give it back!
Oh, fuck!
Hoshino?
Hoshino!
- Is he out of mind?
- They're coming this way!
Stop!
Get down!
Get out here!
Get out!
Hey, you, stop!
Shit!
Stop!
Get in shape, assholes!
Here's some tea.
You know the southern island in Lily's "Arabesque"?
It may not be the same place.
But in Okinawa there's a small island like it.
It's written "New Castle" and pronounced "Aragusuku."
They say the gods live there.
From: blue cat
I know that name.
I wonder why.
I can't remember.
From: philia
Wow! Girls!
Hello. Welcome.
Thank you for using
Marine Tour, Ltd.
This island is "West Front."
But in Okinawan it's "Iri Front."
West is "iri" in Okinawan.
East is "agari."
South is "fue."
North is "nishi."
He's asking how you say "west."
"Iri"?
Very good.
Let's get in the van.
We'll bring your luggage.
Come this way, please.
I'll shoot the video!
No, I will!
We'll be at the hotel soon.
Here we go!
Are you going to the Shirahama?
Can I hitch a ride?
Can we give him a lift?
All right?
Thanks.
Sorry to bother you.
Are they ever fast!
Okinawans say man was made from woman's rib.
So women here are very powerful.
You guys be careful.
Can I try it?
What do I do?
The red button?
Okay, everybody smile!
Say cheese!
Hilarious!
This is good right here.
I'll get out here.
"Nee Faa Yaa."
Thanks! "Nee Faa Yaa."
Good-bye.
Take care.
Excuse me.
My video camera...
Oh, that's right! Sorry!
- See you.
- Take care.
Bye!
See any wildcats?
Wildcats? That'd be lucky.
We didn't see any.
We want to see one.
He says no one knew they existed until a few years ago.
I've never seen one.
Are they that uncommon?
Yes, and people would eat them, not knowing just how rare.
What are you doing here?
Me?
Poaching?
No. I'm exploring.
Exploring? Cool!
That looks good.
Ice cream. Want some?
Really?
"Nee Faa Yaa."
Thank the boys. They paid for it.
Thanks.
Is this your first time here?
My fourth.
I want to see a "Gorakius."
What's that?
A bird. A kind of heron.
It's the right time of year.
Bye!
Take care!
Hey! The camera!
You look seductive.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, really.
So does she!
- You look good too!
- Not at all!
Hey, what's that?
It's lit.
- That's great.
- Pretty?
- Does it makes a circle?
- Yeah!
It's so beautiful.
You're prettier.
Can I light it on you?
Me? No way!
It's hot!
Oh, it's out.
Your firecracker may go out, but mine won't.
It's beautiful!
That's it.
Rocket fireworks!
Careful!
Freaked me out!
Great!
Hey, girls!
What are we gonna do now?
Let's go see the turtles lay their eggs.
- Turtles?
- Can we see any?
Almost every day in August.
So they'll be there tonight?
Probably.
They aren't coming.
Nope.
So there's no guarantee?
I'm afraid not.
I'm not a turtle.
Look at those stars!
Smile, everyone. Look this way.
No turtles!
Not tonight, I guess.
Shall we head back?
Let's go.
It's late and I'm sleepy.
Don't you ever get excited, Hoshino?
Put out that light!
What's wrong?
Something flew at us!
- Did it hit you?
- What is it?
What?
A fish?
- What is it?
- It's huge.
A flying fish!
It's huge!
It's not a flying fish.
It's called "Shijar."
"Shijar"?
They come flying out of the water.
They're attracted to light.
They could kill you.
Are you all right?
It's huge!
Did you get stabbed, Hoshino?
Hand me a light.
It's huge!
Look! Its mouth is like an arrow!
- Are you all right, Hoshino?
- Yeah.
She's cool!
I can't swim like that.
Great!
Is it good?
Yum, yum.
There's that guy again.
What's he doing here?
I thought I smelled something.
Would you like some?
- Do you mind?
- There's some food left.
My lucky day!
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Thank the boys.
Having fun?
Convenient timing.
So... this ficus tree is also called the "strangler tree."
You know why?
Because it wraps itself around another big tree and kills it.
If you shot that in time-lapse, it'd be horrifying, huh?
Coral's the same.
It sticks out a thin tentacle and kills the coral next to it.
- It does?
- Yep.
For us the natural world is a playground.
But for the things that live in it, it might be hell on earth.
But that's nature for you.
It's good for me.
The place life and death are side-by-side.
It's exciting, don't you think?
That's why I keep coming back.
You said you saw a "Shijar"?
The same family as the "Needlefish."
That's it!
It hit our friend.
That was close.
Get off me!
Shut up!
She can sit on me, though...
What's that song called?
"Aragusuku."
"Aragusuku"? What's that?
An island.
The one over there?
The one past that.
It's the most beautiful of these islands.
"Aragusuku."
Are you okay?
Hey! Somebody!
Are you okay?
Hoshino!
Are you all right?
All right?
All right?
In Okinawa we say a person has seven lives.
You've lost two, so you've only got five left.
Are you sure you didn't bring something bad here?
You can't live with the gods angry at you.
Remember.
Life is precious.
- Something's happening.
- What?
They're stopping.
What is it?
You know that traveler...
Are you all right?
He jumped out in front of us!
It's not our fault!
He came out of nowhere.
It's not our fault.
It's his fault.
It wasn't our fault.
It was his fault.
Don't toss garbage in the water!
That wasn't garbage!
Summer 1999.
Nostradamus was wrong, but if the world had ended, if my life had ended during my summer vacation,
I might have been happier.
From: philia
It did end.
Humanity's extinct.
The world we live in now is "The Matrix"! :-)
From: blue cat
If that's true, humanity's last day was September 1, 1999.
The first day of school.
From that day on, the world was gray.
From: philia
Long time no see.
I was just telling them.
You almost drowned?
Tsujii! What's with the hair?
I dyed it.
Who said you could do that?
Tomorrow I want it black.
Inubushi.
You're a fine one to talk!
Look in a mirror!
What?
Your hair.
My hair? What about it?
You're a fine one to talk.
You've got a lot of balls.
You feel really tense.
Let me in there!
Cut it out!
Hold him down!
He jumps...
He's got a blade!
Hey, Dog!
Hey!
Tell me: How do you wanna swim?
You'll do the dog paddle.
Do it right.
Here.
Fetch.
With your teeth.
Not with your hands. With your teeth.
That's enough.
You can come out now.
Just kidding.
Kanda wants to see you tomorrow.
He says if you want to quit the club, write a letter.
Fuck off.
Inubushi says he doesn't want to come back to school.
This is our problem.
Let's talk about how this happened.
Anyone?
EXECUTION
The year 2000.
Fourteen years old.
The age of gray.
Only the rice fields are that bright, sterile green.
From: philia
You know her?
Tsuda.
Shiori Tsuda.
She's from our school.
Sure you know her.
She's in your class.
You know what we have to do?
Just follow her.
That's all.
Hello?
Hello.
Nice to talk to you.
Okay.
I like your voice.
How old are you?
I'm 14.
What's your name?
"S"... "ST."
Are you busy?
No.
You're "T," I'm "S."
Hoshino took some dirty videos of her.
She can't get away.
He'll work her to the bone!
This is your cut.
That's what Hoshino said.
Hey.
See her home.
You're in the same class.
Get going.
I heard Hoshino's sucking money out of you.
Take this.
Pick it up.
For me... only Lily... is real.
For me... only the Ether... is proof I'm alive.
But lately my Ether is running out.
Dear blue cat, talk to me.
Tell me about Lily.
Or about the Ether.
Or about her, a girl who likes Lily and Debussy.
From: philia
One, two, three.
A bit too fast.
Sorry.
One, two, three.
Let's take a break.
Are you okay?
I can't do it. Ask Kuno.
Kuno.
Kuno, could you come here?
I want to go home.
Let's go home.
Izawa says she can't play it.
Will you do it?
I'm sorry.
Give it a try, okay?
Here we go. Stand up.
Why is Kuno playing?
No one picked her.
Izawa's not feeling well.
What's wrong with Kuno?
We voted on it.
But she's the best.
We can win on just the piano.
It's not a piano contest.
We all decided on this.
Let Izawa do it, please.
Right-o!
That's what we call democracy!
Right!
Izawa!
Izawa! Izawa!
No way. Izawa has declined.
So what if Kuno declines?
She should decline and step down now.
Step down now!
Step down now! Step down now!
Enough of this!
We haven't got time for this.
Let's practice!
Fine.
Okay?
Be my guest.
Let's begin.
Let's bail.
Are they allowed to do that?
Sasaki! Can I go too?
Let's get started.
But how can we rehearse without them?
Miss Osanai, would you call the girls for me?
What's wrong?
No, I'll do it.
Could you conduct, please?
What's going on?
Why can't they sing with Kuno?
Please, Miss Osanai.
Just open your eyes.
This is out-and-out bullying!
Why do they have to do that?
They have no reason.
Kanzaki says she's repulsed to the core by Kuno.
How do the other girls feel?
If Kanzaki says jump, they ask how high.
Can we change to
"Kitten on the Keys"?
You bet.
I changed the arrangement.
It's the "no piano" version.
Aren't we rehearsing?
"No piano" version?
I see. A cappella.
A cappella?
Soprano, bass...
This is pretty difficult.
Are you serious?
Where's she playing?
A little louder from the top.
Let's turn on the lights.
Aren't we done yet?
Kuno's not going to play the piano.
So please...
It's a bit late.
We haven't rehearsed.
Who's going to play?
There's no piano.
We changed the arrangement.
It's a cappella.
A cappella?
What's that?
What should I say...
Human karaoke.
Human karaoke?
What's that?
So what should I say?
Well, you girls gonna be the stars!
You know the melody.
All you have to do is sing.
That's all. Please!
Hasumi!
You ask, too!
What's this?
Tuning.
Kuno's playing the piano.
No, she isn't.
What's she doing?
Tuning, I said.
Here we go.
Did you arrange that?
Of course not. Kuno did.
I'm so glad Kuno didn't play.
- See? It's good she didn't play!
- Yeah, really!
The next...
Hasumi.
Get on.
It's all right.
Don't be shy.
Where's your bike?
It's amazing how women can ostracize someone like that.
It's because she's so popular with guys.
Are you a Kuno fan, too?
No.
Bullshit! You must notice her.
- She sits right in front of you.
- So who sits in front of you?
Tsuda.
Does that mean you like her?
Yes, I do.
Are you going out with her?
I saw you guys walking together.
I just ran into her at the station.
Does she have a boyfriend?
- Tsuda?
- Yeah.
I don't think so.
You're sure?
Hello?
It's Hasumi.
What?
Sasaki wants to see you.
What?
He'll wait for you on the roof tomorrow.
What does he want?
Go and find out.
I got it.
Bye.
- Hello?
- Hello.
Well... is this from Hoshino?
I said "Sasaki."
So it's not that?
What's "that"?
Is Sasaki a customer?
Because I need to know what panties I should wear.
It's Kentaro Sasaki we're talking about.
So it isn't work?
No.
Oh, God!
Lately whenever I think of men,
I think "customer."
Maybe this will be more fun.
You think so? Why?
Go and see.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Hello?
He's waiting in there.
The shed on the right.
Oh, my heart's breaking!
Am I a bad girl?
- Miss Kuno!
- Find her!
Kuno! Come out here!
There she is!
Grab her!
Hold her!
You idiot!
Find her!
Hurry!
Come out!
She's over here!
Come on!
Do you know this place?
This factory was
Hoshino's family business.
It went bust and his family broke up.
That'd screw up even a good little boy like him.
Right?
Don't let her go!
Quiet down!
Hold her!
Hurry up and do it!
Now!
You can't get away from us.
What are you doing? Be good.
- What are you doing?
- Cut it out!
Hold her!
It's okay, Miss Kuno.
I won't do anything to you.
"It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!"
Jesus!
Long ago, people believed the Ether filled the universe as a medium for the propagation of light.
From: Bear
But the Ether Lily talks about is a catalyst for emotion.
Philia's the one who knows best about that.
From: Pascal
Thank you very much for all you've taught me.
From: Winter
Speaking of Philia,
I wonder where he's been lately.
From: Sleepy Head
- Look at this!
- Where'd you get that?
He was sound asleep, so...
Don't tell anyone.
I'm starving!
Menu, please.
All right.
Excuse me.
What? I'm eating too much?
Who cares?
What did Sasaki say?
He likes me and wants to go out with me.
Good for you.
I said no.
Why?
I'm not good enough for him.
Sure you are.
No, I'm not.
He says he likes girls with a positive attitude.
Excuse me.
The "Grande," please.
I'm not positive.
Sure you are.
There is no "positive" or "negative" for us, you know.
"Hey, Sasaki, what's your blood type?"
Type A? Wow!
"That means you're high-strung but cheerful, huh?"
- I can't talk like that anymore.
- Why did you turn him down?
He'd look out for you.
He'd fight Hoshino for you.
He'd be there for you.
He was your chance to get out.
You look out for me.
That sounded so cool.
You're so passionate.
But you like Kuno, don't you?
It's obvious.
You're blushing.
I am not.
Do you think he'd let me go if I got fat?
Or got a Mohawk?
Shit.
Good morning.
Excuse me.
This, too.
Excuse me.
Thanks.
What's this?
Lily Chou-Chou.
We're here.
What?
Is this her latest?
That's last year's.
Her latest is "Breathe."
- I'd love to hear it.
- It's great.
Can I borrow it?
Let me borrow it, stingy.
Her first album's great.
"Jewel."
Is this the new one?
It's two years old. "Jewel."
What about the new one?
I don't have it.
Liar.
Stingy.
She'll be all right.
Kuno.
She's tough.
- Yuya Kitajima.
- Here.
Yoko Kuno...
Miss Kuno?
- Kentaro Sasaki.
- Here.
Ryoka Sasano.
Misuzu Sato.
Masumi Shoji.
Kazuetsu Suzuki.
Mayumi Suzuki.
Erika Tamune.
Shiori Tsuda.
I wanted to die many times.
But I couldn't.
Falling! Falling! Falling!
Like an endless loop...
I keep on falling.
Somebody!
Help me!
Somebody!
Get me out of here!
From: philia
Dear Philia,
I know you're feeling the invisible Ether deeper than anybody.
From: blue cat
I don't understand.
I just don't understand.
From: philia
I understand.
Because...
I know the pain you feel.
From: blue cat
I take a deep breath.
"Breathe!"
And then I understand it all.
Everything Lily means.
From: blue cat
"Breathe!"
I'll try to say it loud.
"Breathe!"
From: philia
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Within the pure Ether!
We're alive!
From: blue cat
"Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!"
From: philia
"Sympathy! Sympathy! Sympathy!"
From: blue cat
"Arabesque"!
"Wounds that Heal"!
"Glide"!
"Experiment in Love"!
"Hearts in September Rain"!
"Airship"!
"Abyss of Loneliness"!
"Music Box"!
"Erotic"!
"Wings That Can't Fly"!

We've got to get our hands around Hoshino's neck.
It was all his idea in the first place.
You told us to do it!
I said to threaten her, asshole!
Who told you to rape her?
No one. I never heard it.
It was all Hoshino's idea.
Right. That's right.
He's got to pay for it.
But can these guys do anything now?
One, two... three, four, five.
Five of you should be able to kill Hoshino.
Excuse me.
What?
It'd be good if we could be quiet now.
If this goes much further, we could all get arrested.
Maybe.
But Kuno showing up as a skinhead was hilarious!
That blew Hoshino's mind!
How can you laugh after someone just died?
Now I'm flying through the sky.
I'm flying, flying!
From: blue cat
What are you doing?
Flying kites.
Want to try?
Hold your arms out... and pull down hard.
It's falling!
I'm sorry!
Dear blue cat,
I'm glad I met you.
From: philia
I want to ride on a kite!
That'd be scary!
I wanna fly through the sky.
Miss Osanai! He just threw up!
Shit!
Are you all right?
Somebody bring a towel.
Everything's so loud.
I have a strange noise in my head.
What sort of noise?
I don't know.
What's it sound like?
It might not be a noise.
It's not a noise.
Then what is it?
I don't know.
Miss Osanai...
Yes?
Pocket...
What happened to it?
Hoshino broke it.
On December 8,
Lily's playing live!
The princess of the Ether lands in Yoyogi!
From: Pascal
I'm bringing my teddy bear!
Look for me!
From: Bear
I like "Tree of Silence."
"Erotic."
It allows me to feel her pain.
Which song do you like the best?
The best?
Maybe "Glide."
I like them all, but for me
"Abnormality" is the best.
From Philia?
Yeah.
Abnormality!
How could you?
There're Lily fans from before, and fans from when she went solo.
You like the solo stuff?
I don't know much about Philia, and I don't like Kamakatsu.
That's too bad.
Philia's great!
Have you heard them?
Sure.
Weren't they great?
I don't know.
All she did was sing.
You don't know?
She wrote all the lyrics.
They were ghost-written.
That's what some people say.
But I don't believe it.
It can't be true.
Here, listen to this.
So? Well?
It's not bad.
What are you talking about?
It's fantastic!
But Philia was Kamakatsu's band.
It's not Lily.
There's no Ether in there.
You're ignoring me.
Don't ignore me.
They don't publicize it, but Kamakatsu's still backing her up.
That's bullshit!
It's true.
Lily's releases are timed so they don't conflict with Yellow Fellows.
Kamakatsu does more than just Yellow Fellows.
Yeah, but...
You're a pain in the ass!
Poser!
Who's a poser?
Hey, sorry! Sorry!
Fuck off!
You'll pollute the Ether!
- He started it.
- You're disturbing other people.
Wait!
Could you come with me?
- First of all...
- Tell it to me later.
Where's your seat?
Show me your ticket.
This is a better seat.
Trade with me.
Okay?
Okay?
I'm thirsty. Go buy me a Coke.
Take that.
Just a moment!
If someone talks to you, give them that, okay?
Dear Philia, let's meet at the concert.
You'll know me by a green apple.
From: blue cat
What'll you have?
A Coke, please.
150 yen, please.
Thank you.
What's this?
What the hell's going on here?
Oh, my god!
They won't let us in like this.
Tickets!
Who wants Lily tickets?
We want some.
- 10,000 yen each?
- That's it? All right.
Sold out, kid.
Thank you for coming tonight...
Are you still here?
Did anyone talk to you?
See ya.
It's Lily! Lily's here!
It's Lily!
Where?
She's waving! It's Lily!
Ow! Watch it!
Someone's down!
Call an ambulance!
That day... one soul was lost, and one boy died.
Who killed the boy?
Who soiled the Ether?
A helpless soul... now screams without a voice.
From: Dream Child
I was at that concert.
Have they caught the guy yet?
From: Amica
Because of that incident,
Lily's being tagged "ill-fated."
I hate how she's being... raped by the press.
From: Bear
That's good. The color took.
The school won't let you dye it too light.
Oh, honey. Why are you crying?
Fifteen years old.
You're not together at 366.
Watch your breathing there.
If you try too hard in your first year, you can stumble in your second and third.
You work just as hard, but the results don't seem to come.
And when they don't, you lose your drive.
Soon you have to focus on high-school entrance exams, but you try to have fun while you still can.
So your grades fall off.
And the worse they get, the less you want to study.
So you give up.
Is that what happened to you?
In your case, it's not like a smooth descent.
It's a crash landing.
Can't you concentrate?
Is something bothering you?
No.
No?
That's it, then.
All I can do is say, "Try harder."
So... try harder.
If you don't try harder now...
All right?
How's the noise?
The strange noise.
Is it gone now?
Will you tell Miss Kuno it's time to go home?
The Ether fills the universe.
Despair is red Ether.
Hope is blue.
Through eternity and silence... flies a while glider.
From: Shinobu
As strong light casts a dark shadow, so does the powerful Ether.
From: Multipolar
Because I'm alive, I found Lily.
"Thank you."
Today I've been given the happy Ether.
From: Hinako
I hate everyone.
But I like it here.
From: moto
How wonderful will be the end of all things, as my body rots and I am destroyed.
From: Lemon
Black tears.
Blue smiles.
I am transparent.
A world without color.
From: Lui-hua
Uninjured, I hurt.
Hurt, I feel no pain.
I want to see the beautiful blue sky.
From: Noah
When I'm here, my brain starts to laugh.
You say I don't understand this.
I say people all die... searching for a place to belong.
From: Mifune Ogawa
Lily is very mysterious.
But she's also a living human being.
She needs a certain number of sales to make a living.
Otherwise she can't keep on going.
From: dodon
Lily's not there to heal you!
Don't make her out to be what she isn't.
From: Blue Flower
For the cancer-ridden city hordes who are poisoned by exhaust,
Lily bravely keeps singing.
From: Guten-B
The wound that does not heal.
The wound that may heal.
The wound that should have healed.
It grows wider, wider.
What if the whole body became one big wound?
We can still revive, that is "the wound that heals."
From: Lui-hua
The great wound of the heart is Existence.
I listen to "The Wound that Heals."
Existence will heal you from the past to the future.
From: Shinobu
People can't fly.
From: Frog
Maybe I'm writing this because I want to scream out,
"I'm here!"
From: Palstela
All right!
Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it.
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
No, but come on, we're off to a great start, aren't we?
I knew I'd get here fast, but this has gotta be some kind of a record!
-Oh, you made it!
-Hi.
-How the hell did you beat us here?
-We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
No, we took a cab too.
But I did test runs..
Hey, you made it!
Okay, is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.
I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.
Right. We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you, so..
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately, we can't guarantee a private room.
-And, currently, they're all unavailable.
-Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
Yeah?
-Give her some money.
-I really think they're out of rooms.
They're not, Ross. They're just saving them for important people!
Okay? What if I was the president?
Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.
Okay.
Say, would you mind checking again?
See if any private rooms may have opened up?
This is a hospital.
Okay, I see.
Could we please talk to the manager?
There is no manager.
Just nurses, doctors and semi-private rooms.
Okay, you know what? I have to say,
I don't really care for your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city, and we have no problem.. Oh, gosh!
-What? What?
-Contraction!
-Would you like to see a semi-private room?
-Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
Well, you're only two centimeters dilated, and we need to get to 10.
-It'll be a while.
-Oh, okay.
-I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
-Thank you.
Oh, wait, Dr. Long.
Can I ask you something?
Is labor really as painful as everybody says it is?
Oh, look at that.
My beeper's going crazy.
Hey, don't.. You know what?
You're gonna be fine.
-I guess we have some time to kill.
-Yeah, guess so.
Oh, check these out.
Never done this before.
Doesn't feel good.
Yeah, well, it looks great.
Thank you very much.
I think we're ready to..
Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
Oh, no, not at all. It's okay.
Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.
-Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
-Oh, hi, Rachel.
-Is this your first?
-Yeah, it is.
Well, little Jamie here is our third.
So if you have any questions, or you need anything at all, just holler.
-That's so sweet.
-Yeah.
-Let me give you guys some privacy.
-Nonsense. We're all in this together.
We are gonna share every moment of this with you.
-I think we're gonna have some fun.
-Yeah.
-Oh, okay, I guess.
-Hey, smile!
-I don't know if..
-I really don't want any..
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Ross!
Here comes another contraction.
Okay, just breathe.
-Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
-Oh, my God!
Hey, look at this.
-Here you go!
-Oh, no!
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
The miracle of birth sure is a snooze-fest.
-Hey, you wanna see something?
-Sure. What?
This is gonna be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.
-Honey?
-Yeah?
Listen, I've been doing some thinking.. and I don't know whether it's because we're here.. or Rachel's giving birth.. but I think we should try to have a baby.
Okay.
What's that now?
Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I think we're ready.
Are you kidding? You think we're ready to have a baby now?
This is fun.
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!
You said you were ready too.
Yeah, but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird..
Like mine is now!
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid, like, forever?
Yeah, but no one ever wanted to have one with me. I mean..
Now I'm just gonna have a baby if I want to. Oh, what are you doing to me?
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Okay, then, back off, mister!
Because I am ready to have a baby.
I just want Joey to be the father.
-What? Are you crazy?
-That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!
I am sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
Oh, that's very..
Really, very, very okay.
Julie's cervix is dilated seven centimeters. That's about four fingers!
-Doctor let me feel it myself.
-Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?
-No, I don't.. We're not gonna do that.
-We won't be doing that.
Well, if you like, you could feel
Rachel's, then feel mine to compare.
-Am I interrupting?
-Yes! Thank you! Later.
-No, you can't leave me alone with them.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
No, Ross? Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I wish you'd called first.
That's all right.
I'm coming back later with your father.
-I needed to talk to you before the birth.
-Okay. What's up?
Ross, I want to talk to you as your mother.. even though I know that you and I are also very close friends.
I really don't know what you're talking about, but okay.
I brought something that I want to give you.
Assuming, of course, that you want it.
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
-Mom, no. Come on. Thank you.
-Just hear me out..
No! Okay? We've been through this.
We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant. Okay?
Honestly, Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.
You think young people use that word more than we actually do.
Ross, a child should have a family.
You know what? I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry.
Go.. Hey, go talk to Monica.
She got a new haircut.
You'll hate it.
Just think about it. If you don't,
I'll talk more about humping.
Give me.
-Hi, dear.
-Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
Ross, get in here!
You wanna see something funny?
Monica.
Okay. All right, stop it.
You're freaking me out.
Do it again. Do it again.
Hey, Rachel had the baby.
-What?
-Really?
No.
I don't know why
I thought that'd be funny.
You said hi to Mom before she left, right?
I thought that was her.
Yeah, I called her name, and she ducked into a stairwell.
Well, you know what?
Consider yourself lucky.
She pulled me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
-Oh, my God.
-How annoying.
Yeah.
-Why aren't you with Rachel?
-You're kidding, right?
Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having this baby.
And I know she's not just some girl I humped..
Oh, humped?
Come on, Ross.
But it just seems that you two belong together.
Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Right. And with who again?
He's crazy. Why doesn't he wanna be with Rachel?
I know.
Seriously, she's like the perfect woman.
I mean, I know she turned me down.. but if she hadn't and she wanted to be with me..
I would take her in my arms and..
I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while, have I?
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Who's that?
-New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
Right after you left, they wheeled her off into delivery.
Oh, but not before she gave me a nice, juicy shot of little Jamie crowning away.
Wow. Sorry.
So how are the new people?
Well, they have some unusual pet names for each other.
Including "Evil Bitch" and "Sick Bastard."
-Oh, gosh, a contraction.
-Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
-Are you looking at her?
-No!
-Don't you look at her, you sick bastard!
-Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!
She's in labor. You like that, you sick son of a bitch?
I'm just gonna..
See? It's because you were looking, you fat pervert.
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.
You miss your girlfriend?
Just ignore them.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
-Ross.
-What?
-He's looking at me.
-Hey!
You wanna live to see your baby?
Don't you talk to my husband like that, you stupid bastard!
Oh, good God! If you want a baby so bad, just go steal it!
Oh, don't worry.
These babies are far too ugly for us.
What is going on with you.
Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies.
I'm crazy about us.
What?
We've always talked about having babies someday, not now.. but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good.
We're really good.
We are pretty good.
But nothing has to happen until you're ready.
Well, maybe I'm ready now.
I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
What? It's not right!
We're not ready to have a kid now!
-What?
-I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
So we're gonna try?
I mean, we're trying?
We're trying to get pregnant.
I'm not comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
-So when do you want to start trying?
-All right, hold on a sec.
-Period math?
-Yeah.
Well, we could start trying now.
-Right here?
-No, not here.
Maybe here.
It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill, and we're in a building that's full of beds!
And it's so clean!
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!
-It ate your money?
-No.
-I'll see you downstairs then.
-All right.
Hey, I got one! I got one!
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Oh, up or down?
-Oh. Down, please.
I hate to be a ball-buster, but can I just do it?
-Could you press up too?
-Sure.
-I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.
-Yeah? How'd yours happen?
Well, it's a long story, it's kind of embarrassing.
Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
-How about you?
-Car accident.
Some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
Yeah. Me.
-Sorry.
-Oh, no. No, don't be.
Nobody else got hurt.
And I was pretty lucky.
Well, I, for one, am glad you made it.
Are you sure?
I mean, you don't know me.
I could have been sent from another planet to destroy Earth.
Couldn't press the "down" button.
I think Earth's okay.
Oh, hey, that's me.
Hey, I take it you're just visiting someone.
Well, if you have some time and you wanna visit someone else..
Yeah, I would like that.
-Great. I'm in room..
-Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!
You gotta press the button.
The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
Oh. Is she pregnant yet?
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before I do.
-Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
-Oh, okay. Here, here.
That's it.
-Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
-Yeah, it was.
Mine haven't been so bad.
Oh, here comes one now.
Oh, that was a big one.
That was, like, the biggest one yet.
Are you okay, honey?
I'm okay, honey.
Well, I got some bad news.
It gets worse.
And when you get to the end, they get really big.. and they come, like, every minute.
Well, mine are pretty close together.
I think..
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, that's quite all right.
Oh, by the way, my name's Johanna.
What's yours?
Excuse me, could you help me with something?
I'm looking for a man.
Well, who isn't?
You. You aren't.
Good for you.
Anyway, the patient
I'm looking for has a broken leg.
He's in a wheelchair. He's early to mid-30s, very attractive.
Even you would think so.
-I know who you're talking about.
-Great! What room number is he in?
I'm sorry.
Patient information is confidential.
No, I'm not gonna bother him.
We were talking earlier..
Ma'am, I'm sorry. That information is restricted to hospital staff.
-She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
-Dr. Drake who?
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.
-A doctor at this hospital?
-Damn it, we're losing precious time.
You want this man's blood on your head..?
-Hands.
-Hands!
It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room he is staying in.
He's a patient of mine.
I've treated him for years.
-He's in room 816.
-816. Thank you.
-And what is his name?
-No.
-I think we found a place.
-Okay.
Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
Hello, Monica.
-Not like that.
-Oh, okay.
-We'll dim the lights.
-Okay.
Or turn them out altogether.
No scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.
Do we have a condom?
Oh, right!
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
This is it!
-That's him!
-Great. Go get him!
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.
He's not really my type.
Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him questions and see what he's like.
-People tell doctors everything.
-You said he was this great guy.
All the guys I meet seem nice at first, then turn out to be big jerks.
-You do attract some stinkers.
-Yeah, I know.
Dr. Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.
Three women have come and gone with their babies.
You gotta give me good news. How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
-Three.
-Just three?
I'm dilated three!
We are moving along just slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.
-I'll be back soon.
-Thank you.
You know what? I'm not waiting.
I'm gonna push this baby out.
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?
-Actually, it's more like this.
-Oh, stupid metric system.
We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Oh, for the love of God!
It's coming! It's coming!
And here it is!
Oh, come on!
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
I know. I'm a neurologist.
Just to be on the safe side..
Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview. So he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman!
That was a test. Good response.
-All right. Full name?
-Clifford Burnett.
-Date of birth?
-November 16, 1968.
Age?
-Can't you figure that out?
-I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.
-I'm 33.
-Okay.
-And are you married?
-No.
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would you say you have commitment issues?
Are all the questions this personal?
Yes.
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.
-Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
-Yeah.
I lost my wife five years ago to a mild cardial infarction.
-A heart attack, doctor.
-Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, mild car..
Are you experiencing any dizziness?
No.
-Has the pain been getting worse?
-No.
Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
-No.
-Excellent. Excellent.
And finally, are you into any weird stuff, you know, sexually?
-No!
-Wrong answer.
-This room's available.
-Okay! Wait, you listen to me!
Since I have been waiting, four women.. that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters I'm dilated.. have come and gone with their babies.
I'm next. It's my turn. It's only fair.
If you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me, I will sue you.
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.
-Rach?
-You get back on that case, honey!
I don't think the next patient is very far along.
Okay. Well, then bring her in.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this!
And yet, somehow, it's true.
I mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!
Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears.
-Hi, sweetie!
-Hi, sweetheart.
This is my husband, Sid. I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.
I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office.
Thank God for adult acne!
I still can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Really?
What'd he say?
You have to speak very loudly, he's almost completely deaf.
-Oh, there you go.
-Of course he is.
Congratulations, you two.
I didn't even know you got married.
-Oh, we didn't.
-What?
We're just having this baby together, but that's all, you know.
Why?
We're just not in that place, you know?
But we're very excited about this.
Oh. Well, then shut me up.
Just tell me how.
Oh, I feel another one coming.
Sid, you lucky, deaf bastard.
-What else? What else?
-He's 33.
A widower.
He seemed like a standup guy.
And he's not into anything weird sexually.
Enter Phoebe!
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
We could. Or we could have sex in it.
Well, let me think about that while I remove my pants!
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!
Does that sound like Janice?
If it's not, then there's two of them.
And that would mean it's the end of the world!
Hey.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How you doing?
Not bad. You know that feeling, trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
And soon someone will call her "Mom."
Weirdest thing. Did I hear..?
Mother of God, it's true!
Chandler Bing!
Janice.
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.
You remember, Chandler.
I feel so bad for you.
She's your ex. And I have Richard.
Janice, I didn't even know you were pregnant.
Who's the unwitting human whose essence you've stolen?
It's you.
This is yours.
What?
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?
Okay, I've got one for you.
If you had to, which would you eat?
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.
Because at least I could explain to him that you're making me eat him.
-Oh. Somebody went to college.
-Yeah.
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.
Oh. I'll get it.
I usually get to know a girl better before I let her spoon me.
Relax. It's not like we're forking.
When. When.
Thank you. Listen.
You seem to really know what to do with a utensil.
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?
-Yeah, I'd really like that.
-Yeah?
Yeah. And I promise I won't make you eat any remarkable animals.
I was thinking..
I'd kind of like to make a move.
But, you know, with the leg.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe a little help.
Okay.
Let me fix your pillow.
Cliff, you're so forward.
Oh, it was really nice meeting you.
Sid!
That's the first time I heard her voice.
I didn't care for it.
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies.. and I have had no babies.
Why doesn't she want to come out?
You know what I think it is?
I think you made such a nice home for her.. over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Okay.
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.
Doctor, you gotta do something!
Get me drugs.. or light a fire up in there and just smoke it out!
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.
Oh, my God. Okay.
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.
Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
You know what?
This one is.
Oh, my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before.
Well, it must be one of those closed-circuit hospital channels.
No, no. That's a soap opera.
This is a very dramatic hospital.
I'm telling you, the guy from that show was here.. asking me all these weird questions.
Okay, Mr. Percocet.
I swear to you, that's the guy.
Okay, Cliff.
Do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
What probably happened was you were watching this, you drifted off to sleep.. and you dreamt he was here.
Rachel's having her baby!
Which is of no interest to me as a neurologist. I..
That's him! You know him?
Wake up, Cliff!
What is going on?
Okay. Okay. I.. Okay.
I sent my friend, Joey, in here to find out stuff about you.
If it.. You know, if it helps, you came off great.
A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was a fake doctor?
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
-You tried making me think I was crazy?
-That was wrong. I'm so sorry.
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?
I don't think so.
If I may? You told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?
Now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.
She was married to a gay ice dancer.
She gave birth to her brother's triplets.
Her twin sister used to do porn.
-We're trying to dial down the crazy.
-Right.
We don't really know each other, so it'd be easy to forget about this.. but there's something between us.
I don't know about you.. but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
-It doesn't happen to me either.
-Me neither!
-The baby! Rachel!
-Right, right!
Oh, I love this scene.
Okay, look. I gotta go too.
But.. What do you say?
Can we just have that dinner?
The triplets.
You and your brother didn't..?
No! No, they implanted embryos.
-Then dinner sounds great.
-Great! Okay.
All right, then I'll see you later.
Our friend's having a baby.
-Her own?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
No, she's really old-fashioned.
Push. Push. We're gonna push for five more seconds.
Five, four..
Three, two, one! Oh!
The next contraction should be in about 20 seconds.
-I can't push anymore!
-You're doing great.
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.
-Come on.
-Push. Wait.
-I see something.
-What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!
-Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!
-What is that?
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.
-I thought she had two heads.
-Oh, God!
Is she gonna be okay?
-She's gonna be fine.
-Okay.
She's in a more difficult position, so you have to push harder now.
-Okay.
-That's it. Push. Push.
You're gonna have to push even harder.
-I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!
-Yes, you can. I know you can do this.
I had no idea.
Please, you do it for me!
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.
Good.
Keep pushing!
Are you okay?
You have no idea how much this hurts.
Keep going! Keep going!
Here we go!
She's upside down, but she's coming!
-Oh, God!
-Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, she's here.
Oh, she's perfect.
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.
-Where'd she go?
-They're just wrapping her up.
Okay. Well, be careful with her, she's really tiny.
Here she is.
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.
I know. Oh.
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.
-Do we have a name yet?
-No, not yet.
That's fine. For now we'll just call her Baby Girl Greene.
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.
Hello, Baby Girl.
-Can we come in?
-Oh, come on in.
-Oh, there she is.
-Oh, she's so beautiful.
Here.
Oh, my God. She's amazing.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex.
It's incredible. I mean, one minute she's inside you.. and then 47 hours later, here she is.
She looks so real.
You know what I mean.
She's this whole tiny little person.
And she already has eyelashes and knees and..
-What?
-Oh, no, no. It's okay.
For a second, I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand. So we're good.
-Okay, my turn. My turn.
-Aunt Phoebe.
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
I won't.
-Honey, what's the matter?
-Nothing. I just can't stop crying.
The doctor said it's normal, with all the hormones, plus you're sleep-deprived.
So. You guys are all sleep-deprived.
I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.
Oh, God.
-What's the matter now?
-I was reliving it.
Do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
I thought that was so original.
Actually, we've narrowed it down to two names.
And you know what? I love them both.
So just pick one, and that'll be it.
Wow, okay. Everyone.. this is Isabella.
-Hi, Isabella!
-Hi.
What?
That's not her name.
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
So then I guess Ferdinand is out.
-What was the other one?
-Delilah.
Oh, great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
So I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
What are we gonna do?
-It's okay. You'll find a name.
-Easy for you to say.
You already know what your kids' names will be.
-You do?
-I had them picked out since I was 14.
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it?
-Well, tell us, what are they?
-Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
-And if it's a girl?
-I don't wanna say.
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.
Okay. It's Emma.
Emma.
See, I don't want it.
Do you have any other totally perfect names that you're not gonna use?
-Take it.
-What?
She's clearly an Emma.
Oh, honey, but you love that name.
Yeah, but I love you more.
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.
Hi, Emma.
Yep, that's you.
You're our little Em.
What's that, honey?
What?
Oh, you want a little cousin?
You want a cousin right now?
Do I look like a giant sperm to all of you, or..?
-That was amazing.
-I know.
Hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever?
We may have started our family.
In nine months we could be here.. having our own baby.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
I love you so much.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
You wanna do it again?
This time just for us?
Probably.
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he?
He's a keeper.
Look at the little munchkin.
Don't you worry. By the time you're old enough to date him.. he's gonna have a different nose.
-How you feeling?
-Oh, I'm fine.
I really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Well, then he gets a divorce.
It's Ross.
I'm telling you, Rachel, listen to Janice.
They all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.
-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
-That's what I thought.
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend a weekend with her father.. and little Miss New Boobs.
Really?
I hate to be the one to say it.. but, honey, you two are on your own.
Well, that's.. You know, that's..
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.
Maybe we won't be alone.
Because lately things have been happening between me and Ross.
And right before I went into labor, we had this kiss. You know?
So it might be the beginning of something.
-Hey, Janice.
-Oh, hi.
Who's this little guy?
-Aaron, your future son-in-law.
-Oh, no, no.
No.
-I'm gonna leave you three alone.
-Okay.
Man, you see the kid on that nose?
You know what I was thinking about?
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
But we.. We gotta be careful.
We.. You know, we can't let that happen again, you know?
Right.
-We don't want to go down that road.
-No. That's why I brought it up.
-They didn't have any sodas?
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.
And so it begins.
She in there?
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.
Isn't it amazing how every baby is beautiful?
Except that one.
What is this? A petting zoo?
Look. Look at Emma.
I can't decide who she looks like, you or Rachel.
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.
I'm sorry. For the last time, why aren't you two together again?
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.
Which would be fine, except you totally are.
It's complicated, okay?
Yeah, that's true.
You love her, you always have, you have a child together.
There's no right answer.
Look, we've been together.
Then apart. Then together, then apart.
And now we have a baby.
It's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out..
I could never do that to Emma.
I mean, she came into this world thinking everything.. Now me.
What, do they put something in the water here?
It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well now.
I know. If you try to make it more, you might wreck it.
-Yeah, exactly.
-Right.
Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.
Hey.
I saw a woman breast-feeding twins at the same time.
It is like a freak show up here.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
What is it? Hey.
-Really, it's nothing. I'm..
-Rach, come on. What?
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
What are you talking about?
What about Ross?
Please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
I'm just saying that, you know.. someday Ross is gonna meet somebody.. and he's gonna have his own life.
Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.
That's pretty dumb, huh?
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.
You are never, ever gonna be alone.
Okay? I promise
I won't let that happen.
Joey. Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you?
You don't have to worry about that, okay?
Could you grab me my other box of tissues?
-They're under Ross' coat.
-Sure.
Oh, my God!
Joey?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Hi. 
Hi. 
How are you doing? 
Fine. 
I'm sorry I didn't
show up yesterday. 
It's okay. 
I missed you. 
But what for
What for so much sky
What for so much sea
What for
What good is the wave that breaks
In the morning breeze
What good is the morning
Useless landscape
Forget it, Pedro Paulo.
It's over.
- Things don't end this suddenly.
- Yes, they do.
No, they don't.
Look, I don't know if things end this way or not... but what we had together is over.
We'll go on Saturday, then.
For one night.
You can choose a romantic inn.
Pedro Paulo, my darling.
Former spouses don't travel together to romantic inns.
Technically speaking, we're not former spouses yet.
Technically speaking,
I wouldn't travel with you... if my life depended on it.
MasterJockstrap won't let you go?
If you break into my apartment again...
- Our apartment.
- My apartment.
And you're forbidden to go in when I'm not there.
Does theJapanese guy look sexy in his jockstrap?
He's notJapanese.
He's Chinese.
These Orientals are perverted.
Has he asked you to perform any strange acts yet?
There are no "strange acts" for people with open minds.
Don't let him tie you up in bed.
These guys will steal your furniture.
What do you mean "these guys"?
Have you gone mad?
Japanese always travel in groups.
Give me back the key.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
- I was swimming.
- No problem.
Good morning, Miss Simpson.
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fantastic.
In English, please, Nadine.
You're not going to ask me about Gary?
Yes. Your Internet romance.
How's it going?
- Yesterday he said he loves me.
- What?
Really?
He signed off,
" Love, Gary."
Nadine, you mustn't read too much into that.
Americans use the word
"love" very casually.
We say "I love you" like you say "Good-bye."
" Hi. You must be Gary.
I'm Nadine.
I came all the way from Brazil to see you only."
Just to see you.
- Okay. Just to see you.
- Right.
"I know that I don't know you very much."
- Very well.
- Thank you.
No. I don't know you very well.
- " But you don't know me either."
- Ei-ther.
" But I am sure, deep inside my heart... that you are the person of my life."
You know, you don't say
"person of my life."
You'd say "man of my life."
I think "soul mate" is more romantic.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
Vermont Associates.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
Your new law intern.
It must be some mistake.
I don't have an intern, old or new.
Is this Mr. Pedro Paulo's office?
That's me, but at the moment
I need no intern.
New Resolution #5, 7 83/99 requires that... five percent of the payroll of law firms be made up of interns.
Yes.
So you're my five percent.
I ranked third among the 23 candidates for this job.
Your first assignment:
Take these papers to Mr. Juan Alvarado, my father... and return with them signed.
Copacabana,
534 Duvivier, suite 902.
I'm not a messenger.
I'm a law intern.
For your information, my father is a client.
I'm defending him in a lawsuit in divorce court.
Aren't you going to write down the address?
534 Duvivier, suite 902.
"Alvarado Custom Tailors
Refined Clothing Since 1 938"
Senor Juan, please.
- Who would like?
- Who would like what?
Senor Juan.
I would like Senor Juan.
Who would like to speak to Senor Juan?
I have some papers for him to sign.
He's with a client.
You can leave them with me.
Sorry, but I have instructions to bring these papers back with me, signed.
You can wait, then.
- I don't need the Internet.
- You think you don't need it.
- I don't need one of those, either.
- Soon you'll say you don't need man.
Well, for the last two years.
Two years?
No man?
- Or the Internet.
- The best place to find a man.
What ever happened to dinner and a movie?
A guy who spends his nights in front of a computer has to be a good date.
He's not married, and he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.
Maybe there's a reason he's not married.
Maybe there's a reason he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.
Maybe... he's not even a man.
How do you say...?
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
- Yeah, that's it.
Tonight come by my house and we'll go into a chat room together.
- I don't think so.
- Tonight. Promise.
- We'll see.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was a robbery.
Nadine, I'm sure you recognize Acacio... and this is Gordo, his manager.
Gordo is more than my agent.
He's my buddy.
In English, please.
- Sorry.
- Hi. How's it going?
Acacio's going to play in England.
I know. I saw it on TV.
Speculation.
Nothing's signed yet.
- Twelve million is cheap.
- You're crazy!
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
If I were him,
I'd only sign for 1 5.
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
She's right.
Twelve million is too little.
Acacio is a great player.
Thanks, but I don't need anyone to defend me.
You watch and see if he's not the best.
Senor Juan.
That's me.
Can we talk for a moment?
Of course, Mr. Vermont.
Have you finished the American contract?
Not yet.
It's almost ready.
You know, Americans are sticklers for details.
I come from three generations of tailors.
- Details are my specialty.
- I know.
It's just that you...
This piece of junk is really badly designed. Sorry.
You seem tired lately.
As a lover of justice, you should understand... that I'm going through a difficult moment.
- Recent separation...
- Four months is not so recent.
Right, it's not... but then there's my father's case against his latest wife.
The judge is going to rule this week.
Juan. How is he?
He's all right... but I want him to stay away from all the dirt in the case.
Welcome to England, Acacio.
Are you going to miss Brazil?
Yes, I am.
And what do you think you're going to miss most?
Especially you.
What have you got to say to your new fans in Manchester?
Hello, Manchester people.
I love you.
Sorry to interrupt, but this is the fourth class that I've been at.
Your grammar is perfect, but I disagree with the subject.
Really?
Gordo wants to change the program.
Wants.
Adapt the curriculum to Acacio's basic needs in England.
And these basic needs are?
Trash talk.
Yeah. The bad is good, teacher.
The English play an Anglo-Saxon-style soccer.
He won't last five minutes on the field... unless he can tell his opponent what to do with the ball.
And what, exactly, do you want to tell your opponent to do with the ball?
To put in their ass.
Inside of their ass.
At least up his mother's ass.
"Shit" is merda in English, right?
Right.
Go to shit.
- No, that doesn't really work.
- No?
Don't you have anything with "ass"?
You can "kiss it."
Kiss it my ass.
Better. What does it mean?
Oh, shit.
I don't know. Acacio asking an English player to kiss his behind?
Trust me. No one's going to think it's an endearment.
How would you say
casa do caralho in English?
I know.
I look in the dictionary.
It's "home of the dick."
Right?
You need something with "fuck" in the middle.
How do they say it?
" Motherfucking."
No, "motherfucker."
In American films it's "modafucka"!
Who's the teacher here?
Him or me?
Sorry.
Fat, wait for me in the car.
The good old ear test.
How are you doing, son?
My fingers, my eyes can deceive me... but never my ears.
The fabrics speak to me.
I can't hear a thing.
I know. That's why I didn't insist that you follow in my footsteps.
The fabrics tell you what type of clothes they want to be.
You'll never forgive me for not being able to listen to the fabrics.
Who am I to forgive anyone?
I don't defend universal truths.
I defend my own truths... but look where it's gotten me.
It's made you an extremely elegant old man.
What good is elegance... in these days of jeans and T-shirt?
Women don't look for elegance anymore.
They only look for money.
Four wives... my mother in the '50s, yours in the '60s... another one in the '7 0s... and he ended up in trouble with this one in the '90s.
If Veronica ends up with this shop...
This place is my life.
- We're going to win, right?
- Yes.
What do you want?
No rush.
It's just that...
High quality.
It would make a nice suit if it weren't for the color.
But Dad, my idea was to make a Campari-colored suit.
If the cloth cries out to be a suit, it can make a nice suit... even if it was born Campari.
Excuse me.
May I help you?
In English, please.
The lady that went in the elevator...
Is that a student?
No.
I think that I know her family...
No, no. She's a teacher.
Hi, sweetheart!
Ready for cyberspace? 
I just got in a very exclusive chat room.
A friend has just arrived.
She's an Internet virgin.
You do this every night?
No.
On Thursdays
I eat at my mother's... then I come home and take a Valium.
Wouldn't you rather meet someone live?
In a real place?
Like at the beach?
And compete with those teenagers who live at the gym?
No. Thank you.
By any chance... do you meet live people in real places?
No... but I don't want to meet anyone.
Everyone wants to meet someone.
I already met the person
I was supposed to meet... and I married him.
Are you divorced?
No. Widowed.
I'm sorry.
No, Nadine.
It's not like I'm some traumatized madwoman.
Okay, but I am.
Must be Gary.
" Love is a virus... that infiltrates itself... in the system of two lovers.
Yours, Gary"
He didn't sign off"love," but there are two "loves" before.
It's good, no?
Remember me?
Of course.
My public defender.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- What?
Far out.
Can I try it?
Far out.
I need to tell you
that I love you
I could win or lose you
But I need to tell you
that I love you
Beautiful.
You have mine.
I have yours.
Miami I can get you for $7 50.
It has to be New York.
Can I just buy a one-way ticket?
There's a flight with stopover in Paraguay for $650.
$650... It's still a little high.
No, thanks.
You can't get a hotel in New York for less than $7 0 a day.
I'm staying with my boyfriend.
- He has a loft in Soho.
- Can't he lend you some money?
No, he doesn't know me yet.
Your boyfriend doesn't know you?
No. What I mean is, not in person.
I see. He's just heard about you.
We have an Internet romance.
The Internet. Really?
It'll be six months in April.
You're my second client who's found someone on the Internet.
There was a girl from Goias State, not bad-looking... rather provincial, who married a French computer professor.
Gary is a visual artist.
An artist makes a lot of money in the US.
Americans respect artists.
Yesterday he told me that he loved me.
I get goose bumps talking about these things.
6'2", waist-length hair.
Any tattoos?
He only mentioned one: a huge tribal symbol on his back.
You're going to meet this Gary.
I'm going to give you a discount
I wouldn't give my own mother.
Fifteen percent.
Thank you.
" Marjorie and Jo-Jo live and work in New York City.
They have been married for one year.
- They have a big dog called Rex."
- Settle, people.
"They live in a very big apartment on Fifth Avenue."
Fifth.
Shut up!
Shut up, guys.
She said, "Shut up!"
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
- Son of a "beetch. "
- Son of a bitch!
- Good!
- What's the difference?
Bitch is a female dog.
Beach is the sand by the ocean.
- English, please.
- Asshole.
- Fuck you, slut!
- Up yours, dickhead!
- Eat my shorts.
- Blow me!
- Motherfucker!
- Cocksucker!
Shit, that's very sexy.
For that... the referee will give you a red card.
It's a big soccer game tonight.
The national team is playing.
It's on the TV.
- Is Acacio playing?
- I'm sure.
Well, let's get started, then.
Why don't you open to page 3 5 and read?
Do you prefer on the top or below?
I beg your pardon?
The reading.
I should read on the top?
You mean, should you stand up?
I'm sorry. Yes.
- Stand up. Do you prefer?
- No, you're fine.
" Marjorie and Jo-Jo love romantic evenings... and romance in New York City always starts on Broadway."
" Marjorie and Jo-Jo love romantic evenings."
Sorry.
"They enjoy fine restaurants."
I've been searching for a fabric
the color of this bay... 
for some time now. 
I'm serious. I love this color... dirty green.
You're putting me on.
Wow!
Your eyes are the color of this bay!
Man, you're weird.
They are! Look at me.
Look at me.
Let me check.
Incredible.
Exactly the same color.
You're the first person that says they're green.
But they are... dirty green.
I think so too, but everyone else thinks they're brown.
No.
That guy who works with your father...
- Which one?
- The one from Niteroi.
Roberto.
He's not gay, is he?
No.
Not as far as I know.
Why?
I don't know.
He's just weird.
He's my brother.
Don't worry.
He's just a half brother.
Then I just half embarrassed myself.
Mr. Pedro Paulo's office.
It's Sharon.
Sharon, the intern.
Hello, who is this?
Since when do you have an intern?
Jealous?
Me? Jealous?
Are you mad?
I'll be right with you.
Take a seat.
I just called to check something.
I'm filling out a questionnaire in a magazine.
Did you ever make number two in front of me?
What?
Number two.
You know, in the bathroom.
Poop?
No, of course not.
I knew it. 
Thanks for clearing that up.
Good-bye.
Seven years of marriage... and we never made number two in front of one another.
Really?
Seven years and not once.
Cool.
And how about you and Gary?
What? Poop?
No, silly, your virtual romance.
Enough virtual.
No more talk.
Cock.
How long does it take to get a visa?
" New York City is the financial capital of the world."
World. Roll your "r."
" Downtown, on Wall Street... is the World Trade Center... and the Staten Island ferry."
Staten.
- Miss Simpson?
- Yes?
- Who's it from?
- I just make the deliveries.
Thank you.
"On Wall Street is the Stock Exchange."
Let's start from the beginning.
" New York City is the financial capital of the world."
Good.
" Downtown, on Wall Street, is the World Trade Center... and the Staten Island ferry."
So, what's the growth rate?
About five percent per year.
They say that after a certain age... your belly becomes your wealth index.
That explains why I'm always broke.
Everything went well downstairs.
And the girl?
Is she pretty?
Very pretty.
- Good night.
- Bye, Mrs. Simpson.
- Very good.
- Thank you.
Here we are.
Let's get in.
- Are you coming?
- No, it's full.
- We'll squeeze in.
- You count for two.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Beautiful blouse.
- Thank you. It was a present.
Your boyfriend has good taste.
No, I don't have a boyfriend.
I'm guessing it was from a pupil.
- What?
- Pupil. Aluno. 
Someone from our class?
No, he's a private student.
Dr. Vermont.
What are you doing here?
Learning English again?
I would like to introduce you to my girlfriend, Mary Ann.
She teaches English here.
It's a pleasure.
Ricardo was a pilot.
I was a stewardess.
That's how you met?
Flying together?
No. We worked for different airlines.
I met him at a party.
A month later we were married.
Love at first sight.
It happens.
It just happened to me.
How did he die?
Plane crash?
No. He drowned.
The current was very strong that day.
It's a funny thing.
I used to be afraid of the ocean.
I never learned to swim.
Now I swim every day and I'm afraid to fly.
Crazy, huh?
- Waiter, another caipirinha, please.
- Right away.
I'm scared to drive.
You're kidding.
No. Never learned.
Never wanted to.
My wife said that's because
I am without ambition.
That I have no direction in my life.
If it's any consolation...
I think ambition is highly overrated.
Are you all right?
Just can't drink like I used to.
I like the sand.
It makes me feel grounded.
- I have a confession.
- What?
I have to make you a confession.
- What?
- The blouse.
I sent it to you.
You?
It's the first women's clothes
I made in my life.
I'm not sure I finished it right.
Wait, wait.
You made the blouse?
My father has a tailor shop.
I didn't pick up the scissors for 20 years.
You made this blouse for me?
Really?
I'm an attorney.
Attorneys don't lie.
Not outside the courtroom.
You're okay?
Great.
Is Mary Ann in?
Yes.
I'm her student and I dropped by to clear up a question.
- A question?
- Yes. An English question.
You know, those questions that keep you up all night?
No.
Well, I woke up with this question pounding in my head... and decided to drop by.
She's inside looking for the grammar book.
Did you found the grammar book?
Are you an old student of hers?
No. I just started this week.
Cute, isn't she?
Who, her?
I didn't really notice.
She has a marvelous little ass.
A beautiful ass.
Don't tell anyone... but some really crazy shit has gone down between us.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Always at the end of class.
I see.
What type of
"really crazy shit"?
The first time,
I was about to leave.
She came up from behind me...
and took me to school
with her tongue. 
The second time, I told her
about this knee injury. 
That night, against Argentina...
Three to one.
You scored a hat trick.
Miraculous tongue.
Better than Ben-Gay.
Did you found the grammar book?
Teacher, let's go.
Fuck.
- Fuck your mother.
- Fuck your mother's mother.
Kiss my dick!
Absolutely not.
I told Gordo an apartment with an ocean view.
Yes.
Is there at least a lake or a lagoon?
All right, then something with a river view.
I need to speak to you.
About last night...
Did something happen between him and you?
Okay.
How am I supposed to know
London's not on the ocean?
- How do they say that?
- I'll explain tomorrow.
No, no, tomorrow
I talk to English people.
The next day, then.
Speaking of meetings,
I just remembered.
May I use your telephone?
My client has the final say, or the deal is off.
Okay. I'll see you in court, then.
Good-bye.
Lawyer?
- Do you do contracts?
- It's my specialty.
- See you.
- Who's the suit?
Another student of hers.
Good people.
He's gonna take a look at the contract.
Lawyers, lawyers.
- Hi, Pecanha!
- Hi, miss!
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard Mary Ann Airlines.
Destination: Heartbreak City.
Fasten your seat belts, folks.
It's going to be a long and lonely ride.
Pilot's dead, crew's out to lunch... but, hey, have a nice flight.
Son of a bitch.
You left me.
Why can't I leave you?
Calm down. Concentrate. 
Use the Silva Method. 
- The what? 
- The Silva Method of Mind Control. 
Silva's Mind Control.
You place your three fingers like this and then concentrate.
Is that by that Chinese guy?
The Silva Method.
Haven't you ever heard of it?
- No.
- Everyone knows the Silva Method.
Everyone but me.
The little blue book,
The Silva Method. 
It was the rage back in the '80s.
I've never heard about the fucking method, all right?
I'm sorry, Tania.
It's just that...
I heard they give freelancers a hard time.
Relax. You don't look poor.
Just stay cool.
I'm gonna say... that I'm a very sought-after professional.
And that you would never work as a waitress in a foreign country.
Only use that if he gives you a hard time.
What if they ask how many dollars I have?
Lie. Tell them $3,000.
What if they want to see the $3,000?
Me?
Hi. How are you?
What is the purpose of your trip?
Do I need a purpose?
I didn't know that I needed a purpose.
- Purpose?
- Where are you staying?
In Gary's loft.
Who is Gary?
- My boyfriend.
- Is Gary an American citizen?
Yes. I believe he is.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
What is Gary's address?
W-W-W dot...
Excuse me, honey.
I'm her travel adviser.
Is Sylvia, the Consul's secretary, in?
We belong to the same gym.
May I have a word with her?
You eat too fast.
It's bad for your health.
Hello?
You won't believe this.
I just got an E-mail from Gary!
- He's coming to Rio! 
- When?
Tomorrow! He wants my phone number so he can call me when he arrives.
Did he say what time? 
Nothing. No arrival time, no flight number.
It says he's coming
for 'professional reasons. "
But he signed it, "Love, Gary. "
Well, if it says " Love, Gary," then...
Can I call you right back?
Tania, are you okay? 
Do you want to spend this weekend with me?
I do. But tomorrow I have to pick up a gringo at the airport.
You don't want to travel with me anymore.
That's not it. It's just...
And theJapanese guy?
What? Soup. What soup?
Wait a minute.
"3:00 p.m. at the offices of'...
I'll call you later. The judge is going to render a decision in Juan's case.
- Should I notify your father?
- No. I'll talk to him later.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Is Juan with a client?
Yes.
Sharon?
Did the judge rule in favor of Veronica?
I told him I wasn't an expert in these types of cases.
Okay, I'll see you next week.
"Never give all the heart... for love will hardly seem worth thinking of... to passionate women, if it seem certain... and they never dream that it fades out from kiss to kiss.
For everything that's lovely is but a brief, dreamy, kind delight.
O never give the heart outright...  for they, for all smooth lips can say... have given their hearts up to the play.
And who could play it well enough if deaf and dumb and blind with love?
He who made this knows all the cost... for he gave all his heart and lost."
In English, please.
Is my class finished already?
Your class finished early this evening.
The teacher wasn't feeling well.
- Miss Simpson is not home yet.
- Are you sure?
She went to the English course.
She'll be back later.
I know, but...
Thanks.
- Mr. Collins?
- Yes.
- Trevor Collins?
- Yes. I said yes. Do you speak English?
Yes. My name is Pedro Paulo.
Yes. You speak English.
And what is your name?
- Pedro Paulo. Peter Paul.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Trevor.
- It's my laptop.
- That one, maybe?
No, no. It's okay.
I can handle it.
- First time in Brazil?
- Yeah.
I've been to Colombia and Venezuela before, but never Brazil.
Brazil is not like
Colombia and Venezuela.
They speak Spanish.
We speak Portuguese.
They invented mambo.
We, bossa nova.
- Hi.
- Miss Simpson isn't back yet.
- Did she go swimming?
- Yes.
Dad?
"With his feet in London, but his head in Rio"
Hello, my friend.
Isn't this Pedro Paulo's office?
Yes.
Gordo, wait.
He told me to drop by so he could look at my contract.
He'll be back soon.
He's picking up a gringo at the airport.
We can't wait.
We have a very important meeting.
1 1:30 a.m. with the English at the Sheraton.
It's all here.
These papers are too much.
- Too much.
- Too much.
I think your first mistake was to agree to meet at their hotel.
It's the enemy's territory.
An important meeting like this should be held in a neutral place.
It should be at a steak house.
Not bad!
Then you could stuff the English with sausages and caipirinhas...  then get them to sign a clause of transitory irrevocability.
- Please, have a seat.
- Thanks.
That would mean one million dollars more by the end of the contract.
Do you speak English?
Does the rain in Spain stay mainly in the plain?
I'm not usually this stressed, 
you know? 
It's okay.
I'm a little bit stressed too.
Sorry about the air conditioning.
Cookies, cookies.
Take two, pay for one.
Thanks.
It's good.
I'm supposed to meet someone here in Rio.
A girl.
- Brazilian girlfriend?
- No.
Not a girlfriend yet.
Just an incredibly hot cyberspace pen pal.
- Is she pretty?
- She was the "Girl From Ipanema."
Excuse me?
She said she won the "Girl From Ipanema" contest five years ago.
- Then she's very beautiful.
- Really?
- Not that I care about that.
- You should care.
Garotas de Ipanema are very exceptional.
Well, Internet lovers.
You know, people can say anything.
I told her I was a Soho artist and my name is Gary.
Why did you say that?
So I could attract the kind of women that Soho artists attract.
Wild.
Outrageous.
Erotic.
Hip, cool chicks, you know?
I know.
Corporate law isn't exactly a babe magnet.
That's true.
Do you think she'll be disappointed?
No.
This clause is a trap.
Let's cut it.
This one can stay, as long as they pay in case of annulment.
Sharon, something happened.
Roberto, call me in 20 minutes.
I'm with a client. Bye.
This clause makes no sense.
Only in their fucking dreams.
Are you an attorney?
No, Gordo.
She's a manicurist.
Keep going.
This is a recording.
The number you have reached has been disconnected.
Oh, my God!
Is she gonna be okay?
Take a look at it.
" Unless one of the parties stipulates a clause to the contrary."
I dig.
Is it my impression... or are you rubbing up against me?
It's your impression.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Please show him out.
Excuse me, but who are you?
Gordo.
I can see that, but why are you standing there?
Private meeting.
- Hi, Vermont.
- Tania, what a surprise!
Everything okay?
- Who's that man?
- He's Acacio's bodyguard.
- Is Pedro Paulo in?
- I think so.
Pedro Paulo, it's me, Tania!
I need to speak with you.
- Call the police!
- I'm gonna go in.
- Let me in.
- I'm calling the police.
I can't believe this.
This is incredible.
I got a cramp in my leg, and I couldn't swim.
- It's all right. Relax.
- I wanna go home.
The doctor wants you to stay an extra hour for observation.
- You want me to call someone?
- No, there's no one.
Nadine, what would I have done without you?
You look so beautiful.
I have good news.
What?
Gary's coming to Rio.
All the things people say about Brazil... the violence and such... they exaggerate, because Brazil is also friendly...
- You have to let us in!
- This is absurd! It's my firm!
Dr. Trevor, welcome.
How was your flight?
Very good.
- What's going on here?
- Pedro Paulo is in a private meeting.
- I'm Pedro Paulo.
- Remember that.
- Isn't he Acacio, the soccer player?
- Hi. What's up?
Were you fooling around in my office?
- I was here with your partner.
- What partner?
Sharon.
You can't invade my office, put your goon outside... and jump my intern.
I saw them fooling around.
May I use your phone?
You didn't have something crazy with Sharon too, did you?
You can't have crazy flings with every woman in town.
Hello?
Who is this?
Mr. Peter Paul's office.
Please...
- You speak English?
- No.
Please tell him...
Juan is in the hospital.
Lagoa.
Emergency.
Sharon is not authorized to speak for the firm.
Someone named Juan...
Excuse me!
Someone named Juan, I think, just had a heart attack.
Calm down.
And I hung up the phone on him!
It's not your fault he had a heart attack because of the bakery.
Tailor shop!
- Mary Ann?
- Pedro Paulo.
How did you find out?
He's in intensive care!
Nadine, do me a favor.
Find out why those people are here.
Excuse me.
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, fluently.
- You're a friend of Peter Paul's?
- Kind of.
Are you all right?
I mean...
- I'm fine.
- Good.
Could I borrow a quarter?
I've just arrived in Rio... and I will try to get a hold of you at your other number.
Bye-bye.
Excuse me.
I need another token.
I am so sorry to bother you again, but I need to call this girl.
- Girlfriend.
- Love is a virus.
Hello.
- Hello. Nadine? 
- Who's this?
It's me. Gary.
Where are you?
I'm right behind you.
Pedro Paulo, what's wrong?
Nadine, what are you doing here?
That's Gary.
So you don't work in the multimedia area.
Almost.
I'm in mergers and acquisitions.
And your loft in Soho?
New Jersey... and I don't think technically it could even be called a loft.
I lied too.
I'm not the "Girl from Ipanema."
Really?
For when we leave this world...  we actually do not leave.
We remain in the hearts... of those who loved us.
That is why... the dead sometimes seem so alive... and the living seem so dead.
Juan Alvarado, my old friend... you left us... but you remain inside us.
How dare she come here!
She must be riddled with guilt.
Excuse me.
Want something to eat?
- Do you have a beer?
- I have Kirin.
What?
Kirin. Japanese beer.
That'll do.
Everything will be fine.
Yes.
- What did you tell him?
- TheJapanese guy?
Chinese.
I told him I was going back to my husband... and that I still loved you a lot.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Let's open to chapter 3 5.
Who would like to start reading?
London.
I'm gonna make a tape.
I realized I might never hear these songs again.
Piaf was infallible.
Mother said I was conceived during " La Vie en Rose. "
For me it was Charles Trenet.
" Que reste-t-il? "
No woman could resist
Juan's songs.
That wasn't why
I was making the tape... but I'll try it someday.
It will be a beautiful tribute.
Yes, it will be.
Drink?
I'll have one.
ToJuan.
"Dear Pedro Paulo... 
here's the Tom Jobim album
that I promised you. 
So sorry about your father... 
but glad you and your wife
have resolved your differences. 
I am very happy
that we met. 
I bid you farewell. 
Affectionately, Mary Ann"
Okay. I'll call you later.
Excuse me.
What's the meaning of
"to bid farewell"?
It means "to say good-bye."
Did you notice whether Miss Simpson left?
Yes, she did.
- Are you sure?
- Half an hour ago.
You saw her leave?
She took a cab to the airport.
She is taking a trip.
Hundreds of angry fans have gathered
here at Tom Jobim Airport... 
to protest against the sale
of soccer star Acacio. 
There is much gossip
about the young girl... 
who was seen leaving with him
for the airport. 
On your arrival in London, you'll have a press conference.
According to the contracts, you must wear a Nike cap... and the Manchester jersey, and you must drink Diet Pepsi.
- You got that, Gordo?
- Of course.
- Diet Pepsi, NikeJersey...
- Team jersey.
That's right. Nike cap.
There's a sponsor, a beer company called...
"Winterbreath."
They have the right to tape a commercial.
You at the airport, bottle in hand, saying:
"I'm here for Winterbreath."
- Did you know that, Gordo?
- Of course.
Then say it.
"Ladies and gentlemen...
I'm here for Wintergrass."
What vinaigrette?
It's not a sauce, it's a beer.
"I'm here for Winterbreath."
- You should be going with me.
- Me?
- Gordo, get her a ticket.
- No, you can't be serious.
The flight's sold out.
Filled with reporters.
Give her your boarding pass.
You come tomorrow.
I can't. No way.
You can't just hand over a boarding pass.
Tell the English I'll only go if she goes.
No. You're crazy.
She doesn't even have a passport.
Well, by coincidence,
I happened to bring it.
Mercenary! Mercenary!
Acacio is now on his way to the Tom Jobim International Airport...
This way.
A five-year visa.
It's like being approved by the Vatican to get into heaven!
What's she saying?
Of course, Gary had to go to the consulate.
- Trevor, please.
- To me you'll be Gary forever.
You'd never guess by the way he looks... how good he is in bed.
- Come on, now... in English!
- No, no.
Look, I'm really sorry about the mix-up at the hospital.
- I hope your fiance's forgiven me.
- My fiance?
Is he still mad?
My fiance is fine.
He wanted me to apologize to you for his hot temper.
Acacio is now on his way to
the Tom Jobim International Airport... 
where he'll be boarding
for London. 
A group of angry fans
are waiting for him at the entrance. 
Mercenary! Mercenary! 
Mercenary! Mercenary! 
Acacio, how does it feel to leave Brazil?
I feel sad and happy.
Sad because I love Rio.
I'm going to miss this city, my friends, the ocean... because London has no ocean.
What are you doing here?
- I came for Acacio's farewell.
- Me too.
It's a very important moment in national sports.
Very important.
- Sharon!
- I'm glad I ran into you.
I'm officially resigning my internship.
I need to talk to you.
Excuse me.
Here, listen to this.
- Who is this?
- Charles Trenet.
Who?
Let's go.
I love it.
Thank you.
Miss Simpson.
- Please, don't go.
- Don't go where?
Don't go anywhere.
- What are you talking about?
- Where are you going?
Nowhere.
Nowhere.
Nowhere?
Yes, nowhere.
I'm going nowhere.
I was just seeing Nadine off.
How. 
Hey, stop.
What are you doing?
Hey!
H- hot!
Not ready yet?
Be patient.
But I've got a TV rehearsal.
What a hustler.
Give me a hand!
- Hurry up!
- I know.
- Your bandage...
- Oh yeah.
Over there.
Pose.
It's summer by the sea... come on now.
Hurry!
This isn't a thriller!
- What is it?
- What's wrong?
Watch out!
ATRAGON
It's dangerous. Keep back.
Your stolen car?
Yes, I'm certain.
How did it get stolen?
I was waiting for Mr. Shindo at Towa Construction Company.
Suddenly, I was choked and passed out.
A kidnapper wouldn't jump into a cold sea...
Who are you?
I'm a reporter.
Will you explain again?
Again?
Until I'm satisfied.
You were taking PR pictures.
What time was it?
About 20 minutes past 12.
A man came out of the sea?
- Yes.
- Here, right here.
He appeared suddenly.
Seemed made out of vapor, didn't he?
Or steam.
Be serious, will you?
We are... as truthful as a camera.
Why would he let off steam?
I don't know. But it's true.
Officer...
The hands that choked me from behind were hot, like fire!
Officer.
What is it?
Nothing down there.
I didn't find any bodies.
There!
- Get on the ball! I found a model!
- A model?
Miss!
Very nice.
A nice model.
What?
It's Action Magazine.
They want the cover picture.
It's ready. So-so.
So-so? I like that.
- Mad? Find her then.
- Why?
For my model.
But 10 million people in Tokyo, about half are women... I can't find her.
Find this number.
Easy.
I've never played sleuth before.
"SO 72-95".
Did you steal something?
What?
Police officers are here.
More questions?
An engineer was kidnapped at a dam site.
He's the second man since last night.
Vapor man again?
Gave off steam like a geyser.
Geyser man?
So you believe us now?
No! We have no evidence at all...
Only one thing to go on.
Those two who were kidnapped are civil engineers and experts on cave-ins.
Was it a coincidence?
By the way...
Earthquake!
The Vapor man!
A man to see you, sir.
U. Unno, True Story Magazine reporter?
His business?
He said he would like to ask you about the Imperial Navy enigma.
Enigma?
Tell him I have nothing to do with it.
You don't?
I see. You are a shipping company president now.
But you're the former Admiral Kusumi of the Japanese Navy.
Am I wrong?
I have no sensational war stories.
You've got one secret?
I feel chilled... excuse me.
About your secret.
A special submarine which never appeared to the public...
A weekly wrote it up...
A-400, the largest submarine.
Old news.
Yes, that's right.
A-400, 401, and 402 were disposed of after the surrender.
That's right.
But there was another submarine sailed on the night the war ended...
...A- 403.
403? Not even interesting as fiction.
The captain was Commander Jinguji...
He was your right-hand man, best sub man...
Where did he go?
You know what his special mission was.
Don't be silly!
He died before the surrender off the coast of Saipan.
A fine man.
He is alive.
What?
That's what reports say.
Hello, it's me.
You found her?
I'm better than a cop.
What now?
What? Get her consent?
Maker her pose nude?
Fool!
I didn't say nude!
It's utterly idiotic!
Groundless entertainment is stupid.
Did my father really die?
Makoto, what are you implying?
I'm sorry.
Your father was a fine Navy officer and unequaled in shipbuilding techniques.
The night before he left for an attack, he came to me and...
...asked me to look after you.
You were 3 at the time.
Did he really have to leave his only child and go?
That's war.
Country comes before personal feelings.
Country?
Yes, patriotism.
Patriotism?
Young people now may not understand it.
It's here.
Kokoku Shipping.
That car!
Come on.
- Should we go to her house?
- That's my boy.
Never let the prey get away? I know.
What's wrong?
Forget that phony reporter's words.
It's not that. Lately a strange man has been following me.
He's watching me when I go out or when I'm near my apartment.
I'm frightened.
Perhaps it's best to notify the police.
If anything happens to you,
I won't be able to face Jinguji.
Where are we? This is a wrong road.
Please be quiet, Admiral.
What? Who are you?
Something's wrong.
They're headed straight for the sea!
Admiral, please get out.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to obey my orders.
Over there!
Hold it!
What's this?
- Violence is not good!
- What are you going to do with them?
I will have them pledge loyalty to the Mu Empire.
The Mu Empire?
I'm Mu Agent No. 23.
You're mad!
It's a mythical Empire which sank into the Pacific Ocean...
...thousands of years ago!
You're well informed.
It's nonsense!
Well, you'll see.
Are you crazy?
Let go!
We have special energy. It's useless.
Be quiet!
Hot!
You two will work for us as slaves.
Slaves?
Uncle!
Our Agents.
- A submarine will come for us soon.
- A submarine?
Admiral, even if you kill me, other agents will come to get you.
Come with me and I won't shoot.
No, we'll meet again.
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPT.
So, you are the one who fired?
Yes.
He escaped into the sea?
The point is they're sent all over the world.
What agent?
A Mu agent.
The Mu Empire? Is it in Africa?
Think so?
No, it sank into the Pacific Ocean
12,000 years ago.
Sir, this.
This is for you, Mr. Kusumi.
For me?
Admiral Kusumi c/o Police Chief Ito.
From Mu Empire Agent No. 23.
It may be an explosive. I'll open it.
- A time bomb?
- Please.
It seems like a film.
The Pacific Ocean...
12,000 years ago, the glorious Mu
Empire existed in the Pacific Ocean.
The whole world was Mu Empire's colony.
You will be shown proof.
Cursed by fate, she sank to the bottom of the sea in one night.
But our ancestors survived.
The Mu people far surpass the people who live on earth.
With terrestrial heat we made a sun.
We live at the bottom of the sea by using buried resources.
Mr. Kusumi, the A-403!
Why is the A-403 there?
The Japanese Navy's pride... it is the best and largest submarine.
Commanded by Capt. Jinguji.
We regret he and his crew were not on it when we took it.
Admiral Kusumi...
Our reports say Capt. Jinguji is building a more powerful...
...and efficient submarine.
Atragon could be called an undersea battleship.
As you know, Admiral.
Now, in conclusion...
Stop the construction of Atragon immediately.
And return the world to the Mu Empire, so we can inhabit the earth again.
Listen to our people's joyous voices!
If you refuse...
...our curse and Manda's, our deity's messenger, will be on you.
Are we sane?
I think so.
So the world was the Mu Empire's colony?
It's a stupid joke.
Ajoke?
Wasn't that the real A-403?
It could be an imitation.
What do you think?
So it's a blackmail case, isn't it?
The police can't cope with it.
The perps are too big.
FILMS THREATEN NATIONS
EMERGENCYMEETING AT U.N.
The U.N. met about the Mu film.
Most of the delegates were skeptical.
It took only 10 minutes to decide to ignore them.
End of special news.
Captain, something ahead!
Captain, starboard...
Stop the engine!
Captain! Captain!
Full speed astern!
SOS, SOS...
MU DECLARATION SHOCKS WORLD
VENICE DESTROYED
HONG KONG IN RUINS
The U.N. sets up a United Defense HQ to cope with the emergency.
Trouble in "B" Block Area, long.
140°31 'E, lat. 9°20'N.
Immediately, orders are sent to the Red Satan...
...the world's newest atomic submarine which is operating in the area.
The Red Satan was crushed by water pressure.
It was the world's best submarine.
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.
Of course, we could use the H-bomb.
But I doubt its power in high pressure water.
And its use is limited due to moral principles...
Atragon comes to mind.
We have no idea of its efficiency.
But the Mu Empire has noticed it.
It must have something that they are scared of.
Please contact Captain Jinguji at once.
Contact?
I don't know where he is.
But the film said you know where he is.
I don't know!
Then why did you remain silent when Captain Jinguji left?
Mr. Kusumi.
The U.N. requests that the Atragon be used.
Very well.
I was silent for the Captain's sake, but I will tell you.
The Captain revolted.
Revolted?
That's all.
Yes?
- Police Dept. is on the phone.
- Police Dept.?
Hello. Kusumi speaking.
What? You caught a Mu man?
Sir.
Thank you for coming.
Is he the man who shadowed you?
Yes, he is.
But he is not Agent No. 23 who tried to kidnap us.
No, he was a spare man.
Any evidence?
We've been questioning him, but his only answer is a number... 8561.
8561? The number's too big.
Fool!
I'm not a Mu, I'm a Japanese!
Why did you follow her?
You are trying to kidnap her, so you can find out where Captain Jinguji is.
No!
- Then why?
- Be quiet!
Wait!
It's probably the
Japanese Navy tag number...
Soldiers called them reservation numbers to Yasukuni Shrine.
I'm former Rear Admiral Kusumi.
Your name?
Warrant Officer Amano, sir!
You know me?
Yes, Captain Jinguji told me.
What?
He's alive?
Um...
Is he?
Yes, sir!
Where is he?
- I can't say, sir!
- What!
That's his orders, sir.
Admiral, this earthquake isn't a coincidence.
Remember me? I'm Mu Agent No. 23.
Where is the broadcasting room?
The world must obey the Mu Empire now...
...and become our colony.
Order Captain Jinguji to stop building Atragon.
If you refuse, we will annihilate you!
Officer Amano, where is the Captain?
That's a secret.
Please let me see my father.
It will be against his orders.
I'm a True Story reporter.
Even a dog, if it's alert, notices something.
Officer Amano.
As it is, the world will be destroyed.
Your superior, Captain Jinguji's daughter, too.
You want her to die?
Quiet!
Officer, I know you're loyal to the Captain.
I'll explain to him later, so tell me.
I see.
I can't tell you where he is, but I'll take you, sir.
Mr. Amano, it's all right now, isn't it?
What?
The Atragon base.
Which island is it?
- Navy secret.
- Navy?
Japan renounced war in her constitution.
You'll see.
Why did you bring him?
He would write it up if we didn't.
With us, the secret is safe.
Hierarch, Agent No. 23 has returned.
Will we know soon where
Captain Jinguji's base is?
Yes, a contact party of Kusumi has left.
Good.
It will please our Majesty.
Just wait and see.
We'll find out where it is.
Keep an eye on them.
Yes, sir.
What happened?
Cave-in! Power Room 57!
What?
The Japanese slaves just finished checking!
- Send them again!
- Yes, sir.
Hurry up!
Oh, Mu God!
We are trying to build a glorious Mu Empire on earth again!
Oh, Mu God!
Please transfer our hardships to the slaves on earth!
- Don't salute. This isn't the Navy.
- Yes, sir.
We left the plane 3 days ago.
How much longer will it take?
- We will arrive at midnight.
- Midnight?
- What's the name of the island?
- You'll see, sir.
A stubborn fellow.
What is it? Depressed?
It's nothing.
I'm worried.
What would my father think if he knew I came?
Oh, that...
Of course he would give you a big welcome.
You think so?
Are you bitter towards him?
No, I'm not.
But I don't understand him.
A father loves his child.
He was worried about you. That's why he sent the Warrant Officer secretly.
Then why didn't he say so?
It's an old-fashioned patriotism.
People thought it effeminate to think of home.
Please go in.
We can't afford to be caught.
Hey!
Please get ready to land! Hurry!
There?
Yes.
My hunch was wrong! I thought it would be an uninhabited island.
It's big!
All right, get off now.
Who is it?
It's... it's me!
What?
It's me.
Oh, Amano, all right.
Please.
Please get in.
It's stuck!
Here.
Everyone, please get out and push!
Are you ready?
Huh? Where is the True Story's reporter?
There he is.
How can you?
Look at that. It's amazing!
Iron pyrites, bauxite, manganese.
Untapped resources!
GOTEN KENBU CORPS
Amano is back!
This is Admiral Kusumi.
I am Lieutenant Fuji.
I'm Kusumi.
This is Miss Jinguji.
Please relax. The Captain?
I'll contact him, sir!
Amano, ask them to rest.
Mr. Kusumi, isn't it strange?
Whats strange?
There are no docks or factory.
Underground.
Hear it?
Faint machine noises.
Thank you for waiting.
Commander is here.
Jinguji!
It's been some time, sir!
I didn't know you were alive.
I thank you for treating my revolt quietly.
It's over and done with.
Captain...
This is Makoto.
Surprised? She's become beautiful.
Thank you!
Please relax.
It's an amazing place. Any natives?
Only those helping us.
It's ideal for our base.
The Atragon?
Atragon?
I see.
I'm wrong?
We are testing Goten-go tomorrow.
Goten-go?
That's Atragon.
Please rejoice.
We can serve the Navy again.
Do you have any idea why I came?
Amano told me.
That makes it simpler.
The world urgently needs Atragon.
The world is waiting.
I refuse.
What?
Goten-go is for Japan when she's active again.
She's for Japan...
Think it over.
The war ended 20 years ago.
Our Corps hasn't surrendered yet!
Wait!
Not even a kind word for your daughter! War crazy!
War crazy?
Excuse me!
Who is that man?
I guarantee that he won't make Makoto unhappy.
The Captain hasn't been around.
Is he angry?
No, he was always stubborn.
We're not welcome?
But we can't go back.
- I'll show you the dock, sir.
- Where is the Captain?
He has been up all night preparing for the test.
Who is it?
I'm sorry. I got lost when I was taking a walk.
Don't wander around!
I'm sorry.
All clear!
This is the entrance to the dock. Please.
Prepare for takeoff.
Bow, ready for takeoff.
Mid-section, ready for takeoff.
Engine room, ready for takeoff.
Stern, ready for takeoff.
Admiral, I've been waiting for you.
This is Goten-go or Atragon.
Lt. Fuji.
Yes, sir. Standing by.
We will start a test operation now.
In position!
In position!
- Open gate No. 1.
- Open gate No. 1.
Open gate No. 1.
Standing by!
Start!
Start!
Start flooding!
Water level 10 feet.
Fifteen.
Twenty.
Waterway filled.
- Open gate No. 2.
- Open gate No. 2.
- Slow speed ahead.
- Slow speed ahead.
Surfacing!
Hold your horses! A fish leaped.
I knew it wasn't enough noise for a ship.
Look!
Congratulations!
Wonderful performance.
We'll test the Cold Air Cannon tomorrow.
The Cold Air Cannon?
It is an instant freeze cannon.
It's absolute zero... 460°F below zero.
One thing puzzles me.
Yes?
Why does the Mu have the A-403?
And how do they know about Atragon?
It's simple.
When we were seeking for a place for our base...
...an unidentified submarine attacked us.
All of the plan would fail if we died.
So we used A-403 as a decoy to escape.
When they captured it, it was empty.
The blue print of Atragon was left behind.
Of course they didn't have the details but they marked us.
I see.
Please, Admiral.
Drop the Admiral... touching an old scar.
An old scar?
Our new Constitution has renounced war.
Who made us?
What?
You've changed.
My plans seemed like a revolt, yet you said you'd be responsible.
Your former guts?
The 20 years after the war gave us time to think.
Are you saying that Atragon is useless?
Who said so?
We need it... that's why we're here.
Atragon is not useless, the world needs it.
I refuse!
You still don't understand?
I refuse!
I built Atragon for our Navy!
All has changed!
I'll change it again with Atragon!
Fool! Stop talking nonsense!
Nonsense?
You call patriotism nonsense?
Take a global point of view!
I'll devote my life to my country!
Makoto.
Makoto...
Why are you crying?
Do you hate me?
I shouldn't have come.
I was happier dreaming about you.
Please, Father...
Please, do as Mr. Kusumi says.
Makoto...
For 20 years I left you in other hands and spent my time to rebuild Japan.
Don't you understand?
But you don't know how I feel.
Do you understand how a child feels, orphaned by war?
Yes, I do!
No, you don't.
If you did, you would work for world good.
Your way of thinking is like the people of Mu.
I hate you for it.
Makoto.
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!
It's you.
You called me war crazy.
Yes, I did.
And one more thing.
More?
- A war crazy has got a deadly weapon.
- What!
You are a ghost wearing rusty armor named patriotism.
A ghost?
I feel sorry for Makoto.
Excuse me.
Wait!
I've kept this close to me for 20 years.
Take care of her.
What are you doing?
I'll take you to the Mu Empire.
Let me go! Let me go!
Damn.
What are you up to, anyway?
Let go! I'm being kind!
Kind? Stop your joking!
You'll all blow up! I've set a bomb!
What are you saying?
Emergency! Emergency!
Hurry!
Commander, a bomb was set on the dock!
- What? Who did it?
- The reporter, sir.
Halt!
Your Majesty, they are the prisoners from our enemy, Atragon.
What shall we do?
Sacrifice them to Manda.
To Manda?
Manda will be delighted, I'm sure.
Manda!
Manda! Manda!
If Captain Jinguji doesn't listen to us, you will be sacrificed to Manda.
Manda?
Open that window.
Well?
An iron pillar is on top of the hatch.
- Remove it! Hurry!
- Yes, sir.
- Cut it!
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Kusumi, a Mu troop has appeared on Mt. Mihara!
From the crater, the radio said.
- What're police doing?
- Catch them!
Not as easy as thieves!
You take them!
We're the reconnaissance unit.
Have all climbers come down?
No, there are quite a few left.
Move forward!
What are those?
- They are flying saucers!
- No, they're not!
What are they?
Susumu, are you all right?
Thank you.
Mr. Shindo, is there any way to escape?
Even if there were, it's the bottom of the sea.
So there is no use in stealing these then.
Wait! What do you think they are?
Dynamite?
Special ones.
They have been using gigantic rocks since antiquity.
It's called megalithic culture.
They are the powerful dynamite used on those rocks.
I can't believe you stole them and you are still alive.
It's terrible!
I think they will start attacking soon.
Manda!
Manda! Manda!
We warn you in the name of Mu.
People of the colonies!
Destroy the Atragon!
Return our colonies immediately!
It's the only way to save yourselves from ruin!
Note February 10, 2400 hrs.
At first, the New York skyscrapers...
...and downtown Tokyo, you will see our power there.
You will see what we just said is no idle threat!
Not yet?
It's very hard, isn't it?
All right! Let's go down.
Check all parts!
Bow, all in order!
Mid-section too!
Engine room too!
Stern too!
Stand by!
All right.
But we're sealed in though.
You'll soon see.
- Stand by to start.
- Stand by to start.
- Start!
- Start!
Shall we go?
Go where?
I think I was wearing rusty armor.
I took it off and feel fine.
Jinguji!
Please contact HQ.
Atragon will now sail to destroy the Mu Empire!
- All's quiet, sir.
- Good.
- We still have five minutes left. Be alert.
- Yes, sir.
HQ! Come in!
Roger!
Three Allied Army planes!
This is the fate of those who defy the Mu Empire.
Atragon!
Defying our warnings, Jinguji?
Report it to our Empress!
They're escaping.
We'll follow to find their base!
- Touch down!
- Touch down!
- Open the vent.
- Open the vent.
- Depth 500.
- Depth 500.
Come out!
Become sacrifices to Manda!
Don't move! See this?
Understand? Move, and the Mu Empire will blow up!
Open it!
Wear these water-tight suits.
What is that noise?
I don't know!
You, too, Your Majesty.
What? I refuse to go!
Taking you up to land.
No!
I'm letting in sea water.
Wait!
That's the entrance to the Mu Empire.
- Stop!
- Stop!
A monster!
- Open the hatch!
- Open the hatch!
Your father.
Father!
Makoto.
Uncle.
Fine. Fine.
The Mu Empress.
Jinguji, it's useless to defy us.
Do you think you can win?
You defy us!
Mu Empire will win!
We will rule the world.
Killing me cannot kill our Empire's heart!
Empire's heart?
It's the power room using terrestrial heat for Mu energy.
Where is it?
It's located at six miles below the
Palace.
That's right.
Give up and surrender!
We will attack as long as you tell us to surrender!
But we'll listen to peace talks.
Impertinent!
Then we'll attack the heart of the Mu Empire.
- Stand by and dive!
- Stand by and dive!
Dive!
Emergency light! Hurry!
High tension current!
- Cold Air Cannon! Stand by!
- Cold Air Cannon! Stand by!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Advance unit assemble! Hurry!
Salute.
The advance unit will leave, sir!
Start!
What? Atragon is in the power room?
Yes!
Fool! It can't be!
They're inferior to us! They can't enter the power room from outside!
Absolutely not!
- Make sure to set the right time.
- Yes.
We did it!
Stand by to attack!
Stand by to attack!
Fire!
Fire!
Hey!
Let her go.
She knows she'll die yet she's returning. Just let her go.
Susumi!
THE END
Godallejezus.
You have time.
- Mooney, come on.
Mickey, what are you doing?
- Jesus ...
I want to design clothing.
Fashion is the new rock & roll.
Just think of Gucci,
Armani, Versace.
Doyle, wake up.
From each other, guys.
Yellow card.
- I hit him once.
That will do.
I have not touched him.
I am a missionary.
Good move and kill people for money.
Come on.
In hell.
I want to be a professional footballer.
Football is not a question of life or death.
It is much more important.
What do you usually except football?
There is nothing else.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,
Mitchell ...
... but focus should still score?
I know, but I everything to my head.
Is that so?
I hope for a proefwedstrijd.
Otherwise I am not a professional footballer.
Belfast United is my first choice.
But they are Protestant ...
... so they will never see.
I do not like, but ...
You are good ...
... but you would be even better if you use it.
So if you do not quickly improve your game ...
... I can not select more let alone United.
It is unnatural.
Boys and girls must work together at school.
How do you meet them otherwise?
Who determines the length of their skirts?
Do you just clothes?
I do not believe in clothes.
I think of fashion.
I ga the most beautiful women dress in the world.
And then I dress them again.
Bullshit. Footballers get the most beautiful girls.
Wait till I play for United.
Good night.
Would they keep bondage?
What is bondage?
Brazilian star to Belfast
H you. Cams.
H Rudi.
Do you think he is?
The Brazilian striker Carlos Rega
By Belfast United signed.
United hopes that in the team what southern temperament can provide.
What do you think of Northern Ireland?
My family in Brazil is worried.
They hear scary things ...
... but I think it is fantastic.
Everyone here is so nice.
United is a Protestant club.
You are the first Catholic player.
For me football is the only religion.
I give him a week.
Why did manager Frank Mallin this man have?
The boy has rhythm in his blood.
In Brazil is all about rhythm.
We all dance the samba before we can walk.
If we play football ...
... we do not dribble with the ball ...
We dance.
If we play football ....
... we do not dribble with the ball ...
We dance.
An opportunity for Rega.
Ga by Carlos.
Goal.
- Yes.
Did you know?
What says he?
- He plays for a Protestant club.
If you're English is even talk you might find a job.
If my son plays for United, there are two Catholics in the team.
What should it?
Here Sid McLoughlin.
In all my do-it-yourself stores ...
... I paint fantastic offers.
Quality for little money.
Everywhere accommodate.
For inside and outside.
So for all your paint ...
Do-it-yourself with Sid.
In all my do-it-yourself stores.
It is true.
Carlos dancing with the ball.
You've seen Riverdance yet?
So what's your excuse?
Abracadabra.
That word is not Irish.
Why do you think Brazil the best team in the world?
They have balls.
- No, rhythm.
Carlos Rega says that in their blood.
Just as the Protestants.
Those marching.
The only rate that we Catholics have, as we love.
Here ...
Look at this.
Latin-American dance?
Not so hard. Nobody knows
I want to learn dancing.

- Listen.
If I can improve my game.

Men receive discount.

My whole life al
Finally someone who does not dress wear.
Oliver.

Most men do not.
We train for the regional championships.
Lucy wants to win per se.
And she always gets what she wants.
So you play on ten?
- What?
Oh yeah, that's right.
I play also in the forefront. I am captain of the school team.
So ...
I did not know that St Joseph had a team.

Celtic football played.
And what was that game with stick again?
Hurling.

A friendly game?
Collegiates at St Joseph?
Ok ...
Can you still learn.
Football or soccer.
The name does not matter.
It is a British sport.
Our boys do only
Irish sports.
Hurling and Gaelic football.
- But they want to play football.
Therefore, a team you assemblies.
You have your times.
But what I do not like ...
... is that you Collegiates play.
Well, they are slapjanussen.
I understand that a mixed school.
Right. Protestants and Catholics ...
I mean the sexes.
Ah, I understand.
I have nothing against girls.
And our greatest saints from the female side.
But I'm afraid our boys ...
... be affect by the presence of large numbers of ...
... the other gender.
We have a C. .. O. ..
... Double L. .. E. ..
... G. .. I. ..
... A. .. T. .. E. ..
Collegiates.
Come on, guys.
Chiffon would brill are beautiful.
She likes me.

They call it the target.

Shoot them in it.
Since we are again, Danny.

It was really by accident.

Good. Mooney, will you the waist take something broader?
No problem.

Daniel, you know what you biblical namesake happened?
He was cast for the lions.

Unfortunately I have no lions.
But you can come back Saturday.
And now go to the hospital ...

Let him see that we are not barbarians.
Mitchell ...
That dream of you to be a professional footballer ...
Mr. ...
Forget it.
McCutcheon.
I'm not done with you.
I ga the team change.
No, I must continue to train.
What you need is discipline.
It is really better.
To as long as you are the permanent benchwarmer.
Excuse me.
It is for your own good.
Excuse me ...
Are you the.
Come on down.
Mother, this is Danny.
He sits on the St Joseph.
Have you done this?
Excuse me.
I'll make it up to you ...
We can sue you.
- Mother.
Put the flowers in the same somewhere.
I just saw a great waste.
How's your foot?
- It is an old ski injury.
Oh, my God.
Everything good?
I call security.
- No, he will make his apologies.
Really?
I thought your car to the garage was.
My father has brought me.
What the doctors say?
- They want some tests done.
Maybe I should be operated.
And the danswedstrijd then?
I die in pain and you think just to dance.
I want to win.
- Mrs. Burns is a reservist.
How can you call me?
- I could do nothing, remember?
Sister, where is the patint?
Dad.
- Day, Mr McLoughlin.
You are quite toegetakeld, but not as bad as the other, h?
What?
- That is the other one.
Do-it-yourself with Sid.
I like him already
Pupils of St Joseph to each other.
Have you been to St Joseph?
- I was 16th, 20 years ago.
The lovely Lydia.
- Mr. McLoughlin.
Phil is still in the bins?
- Waste disposers.
He is in China for a large contract with the government.
Ah, China. Very nice.
I ga, otherwise I miss the bus.
Are there still buses? I thought you all were burned.
Yes, we give him a lift.
I am not been in years.
Do you love?
Do not be such a snob.
Danny, what will you do if you
St Joseph is off?
I want to be a professional footballer.
Maybe I get a chance at United.
Very good. You should always set the bar as high as possible submit.
But I do not know whether they
Catholics take.
They have Carlos Rega.
This is Catholic.
And also a board member.
He has convinced Rega he had to sign for them.
I so.
Are you on the board of United?
- I am their evil dream.
A Catholic with money.
I want to ask if they once you are watching.
I just can not proefwedstrijd promise.
That would be nice.
Thanks, Mr. McLoughlin. I see you.
What is all this?
I totally do ga.
Lucy is looking for a new dance partner.
I ga me in its report.
You have nothing in common.
It is a rich broad ...
... and you are a poor sloeber.
- Money is not everything.
Wait till you reject United.
That dancing can be very good for my game.
I can excel.
You do not to your game.
Good afternoon, welcome to
DIY with Sid.
You wanted me?
- Come on.
Let me show you an idea.
What you see here?
A football?
- More?
Dad ...
A stage.
The competition is more exciting than ever.
If United win the last game ...
... we play next year in Europe.
And?
- And ...
This means that the last game on the TV.
Instead of the usual band ...
... we invite a celebrity off.
Someone who can show an increase in the center circle.
The stage.
What songs, a few jokes.
The fans will enjoy.
And the board also.
And we get our publicity.
What do you think?
- Sounds good.
Good, then I with it.
By the way ...
What do you do after your exam?
I know yet.
I have more to offer than one side.
I will think about it.
This may be your future.
Think of the footwork ...
... and hips.
We will dance the samba.
The rhythm of Brazil.
Ok people.
And ... two ... samba.
Very good.
You dance with me.
Does not, Mrs. Burns.
My partner is already
Hello there.
Or should I say buenos das?
What?
This Brazilian thing is addictive.
In Brazil they speak Portuguese, no Spanish.
Oh yes ...
Such shoes should I also have.
Are they expensive?
What are you doing here?
I would just learn to dance like you.
Maybe you can help me.
You have my chances of
Championship ruined.
I wanted to ...
- I would certainly win.
Yes, but ...
- Do you play football but now ...
... or something, ok?
All fell on your knien than I have not you dance.
I never beg.

Your dad is right.
You're a snob.
Keep moving. Consistent.

Leave me your samba but once.
Oh ...
That's just a samba.
Goddamn.
Need Help?
Yes ...
"Please."
Please.

You think I'm stupid?
Is there a garage in the neighborhood?
- End of the road.
Ten minutes walk.
Where are you going?
- Home, eating ..
It's pretty scary.
They leave you alone.
Hold on.
Will you come with me?
- Then I miss the bus.
I give you a lift.
Please.
Have you received from your father?
- No, it is the case.
Do you work for him?
Only on Saturday.
Not a bad job.
You fill down many subjects.
I am in management.
Ok you have heavier than me.
Should I feel ashamed that my father richer than yours?
I do not know, my father has been Pleite.
My parents are divorced.
So we are both from a broken family.
We have something in common.
- Oh, God.
These are but the British.
They are already a few years.
I know, but I have no road tax paid.
My father's fault.
- Say that but at the court.
Good evening, sir.
Is this vehicle from you?
- No, it is the case.
Look ...

Yes, dear. I am starving.

Come on, wind me up.
Let me blush.
Only on my feet.
These shoes are extremely expensive.

But you're the third division.
Or the second, if you wash your hair.

Dare you do not agree in person?
Sorry, but I've decided.
It was so good between us.
It was also good between Oliver and me.
Say it plain.
You can find me min
That is not true.
Oliver is right.
"Lucy always pushes its way through."
Say that's not.
- It is, h?
Danny, listen.
Oliver is my friend.
I am his girlfriend.
Friends do things together.
They make plans together.
That is that.
Plans change.
And friends too.
I gotta go.
I ask you something ...
Shit.
I wanted to know what time the party by Oliver begins tomorrow.
Do you?
Love, eat on.
You must be strong.

Come take a look what I bought yesterday.
Where are you, Mickey?
Yes, Lydia.

Do you see that.
I knew you would find beautiful.
Is not it divine?
Would you do it? For me?
Nice house.
Have you already been in the kitchen?
On the floor is sailing and the marble is not marble.
And the Italian tiles in the bathroom ...
Not Italian?
Dad sells them too.
He retrieves it from Bulgaria.
Cheap junk.
You are really cut for the case of your dad.
I can study in London.
Very good.
It is a difficult decision.
It may change my whole life.
Oliver wants me to do.
My father wants me to stay here.
And he is not alone.
And you say after what I have served you?
Nobody is perfect.
You know why I dance champion want to be?
Oliver and Sophie always say that my father arranges everything for me.
That they needed to say.
They did the same.
But I totally dance itself.
I have achieved this on its own merits.
I want to enter the dance floor, in the spotlight ...
... and show what I can.
Do you love?
I did the same with football.
I think this is a good number.
Want to swim?
I do not swim well with me.
Me neither.

You have no number.
- No time.
Laugh now.

Jesus.
You ruined everything for me.
- Me? You can still.
Do you love?
You look terrible.
Since I know you are all wrong.
It is always another.
This is done on purpose.
- Absolutely not.
Why I dance with you?
Because you need champion wanted to be.
I hate you.

Look, Belfast United.
I is expected Saturday morning.
I'm not going to a Protestant club look.
Danny, ga but run.
I must tell the rector.
Never come back again on Saturday.
I have to work.
- Bet.
Mr. Mallin, previously I was always in the forefront.
But I can also as ausputzer player.
About polish speaking.
I want to see them this afternoon glow.
Here you must prove ...
... and then see what we do position you end up.
Understood?
The contest is next week.
We need to have entertainment.
What do you think they are not to Belfast dare? It's secure.
You do not read newspapers?
Believe me. Just listen.
Are you shot?
Hold on.
Our fame is not.
All such advertising. What am I doing against the other board members?
If I do not come, they laugh at me.
Then they throw me out of the board.
What am I gonna do?
Papa, I should tell you something.
You could settle.
- It is good, Frank.
I think another piece of entertainment.
It's your guess. The board expect something very special.
Some had doubts about the adoption of a Catholic.
Give them no reason for you to pop out.
Everything good?
This does not look like my dream.
That goes for everything.
Lucy is studying in London.
That she wanted to please.
I once knew a boy.
They also dreamed of professional footballer should be.
He had talent, just like you.
He had perhaps saved, but we will never know ...
... because he was scared.
He dared not guess the car.
He took no risk.
And you know ...
Since that time he takes every opportunity he sees.
He takes risks everyone advises against him.
As if he has something to do.
Not make the same mistake as him.
Seize the day, Danny.
And the rest may fall dead.
Another, Rudi.
If you have not had enough?
Do not be so depressed.
You should be grateful.
The risk is much smaller
I fashion is king ...
... or Gary magician in Vegas.
But you gotta start somewhere.
I know.
Do you still her?
You would not suit her.
Your differences as silk and nylon.
We had some, but now she goes to London ...
... and I see her no more.
I must give her a reason to stay here.
Like what?
- I.
Say that he should use his mind.
Use your common sense.
There so many fish swimming in the sea.
Oh, and that is your opinion?
Do you have an opinion?
Then, I'll give you an opinion.
If you want girl, you should surprise her.
They love women.
Like what?
- A gift.
Something she always wanted.
Something big.
Larger than my biggest coupe.
I'm broke.
But can you show that you love her.
Thank you, doctor. Will you now.
Wait. You're right.
There is something that they would like to ...
... and I know who can pay.
That she would find the end.
Rudi, you're a genius.
Ok you've had enough.
You are looking for a piece of entertainment for the rest, h?
Yes, the stadium is full.
It is Lucy's greatest wish everyone to see ...
... how well they can dance.
More public will never get.
It's a big surprise.
Mickey regulates costumes.
You mean Mickey Mooney's
Fashion House.
Why are you doing this?
I am sure that the other players you go it fun.
The risk I take.
Say what you need.
That is not necessary.
Calm down, please.
Papa?
Because you're successful, I have a big surprise for you.
What then?
- United against City.
A football game?
- But not just one.
The big game.
I want you here.
Can I bring someone?
Sure.

What do you Lucy?
That is a surprise.
I hope they keep surprises.
The moment of truth.
Dave, an important night for United.
Sure, Jackie.
United must win ...
... to Eurocup Football package.
It is very exciting.
City is doing very well.
Brother, my collar to see?
Everything is ok.
What are they doing here?
- I have invited them.
Brother Xavier has not changed.
That Sid McLoughlin has changed into something terrible.
I do not stand for the anthem.
Shut up.
It says nothing about the number in the rest.
What have you organized?
- That is a surprise.
I thought that someone would take.
Could he not?
- It 's al
Hello, Sidney.
Come on United!
What if they say no?
- Calm down.
Everything is good.
Make you're not busy.
Look.
What do you think?
A masterpiece.
- Thank you, man.
Where are Lucy's stuff?
- That has Sidney.
When will he say?
- I think now.
So I thought: You and Danny ...
Samba.
No.
- Everything is arranged.
Then you luck.
I do not want you to arrange everything for me.
I bring you home.
You're my employee.
- I quit.
Surprise.
This was your idea, h?
Yes.
- I knew it.
There is a lot at stake.
My future depends on it.
Do it now before you guv.
Then I will never interfere with you.
Then you can do everything.
- How can you call me?
This was my idea. I thought I this could make you happy.
And you would continue.
But I was wrong.
Excuse me.
Why?
- Why?
Because I love you.
You're really too far gone.
Well, I do it.
- Thank God.
But then you dance with me.
We are a team, remember?
Sorry, Ollie.
I am now in a different team.
Come on, it's quiet. Good luck.
I am nothing.
He may have.
She is a nobody ...
... just like her father.
You know, you were her mother agree to meet.
Since you can define it to hurry.
My foot.
Inwards.
We have a lot to discuss.
And I thing you need that.
You have guts.
Yes, very good.

In winter 2003, French heroine detox drug Subutex had displaced amfetamine as the most popular intravenous drug of Northern Finland
I was living in Rovaniemi without a job
I lived on social welfare and used drugs almost daily
During that time I started to film the life of my social circle
This is a story of my friend Jani
Need to find some (Mazda) 323
If there is no here we can go around from there
Over here.
(Joonas, director:) ... Some guy ...
Hey, did you hear?
(Joonas:) There's some people, did you hear? - I heard. reindeerspotting
ESCAPE FROM SANTALAND
(Jani:) No need to run anymore
Could you help me now please?
I have here sort of car stereo.
Brand is Sony. Wait, I read (the details).
Xplod 4 x 50 W CDX-4000RX.
This is hell of a good Sony car stereo.
Then I would also have money with it
Oh, damn.
Well could you still ask, even if half a dose (puokki) could be found?
You wouldn't happen to be able to help me?
I would only need just one (dose).
(Hurtsi:) You should have fucking taken everything at once, but.
(Jani:) I only took half (a pill/dose),
So I can finish it during night.
Do you think that these won't work?
Fucking sure these will work.
I can swear on my head for that
(Hurtsi:) I did not say that.
- Not then.
(Hurtsi:) There is not enough.
- Yes, there is.
I took the same at
Jonas' place
Initially it seemed, that there is no effect but then all of a sudden it kinda wakes you up
Take it. Try it.
(Hurtsi:) I don't want to.
Well, do not have to then.
(Hurtsi:) Just use all for yourself
Morning.
I just say that is fucking awesome to fuck someone on speed
When you have a girl going down on you, so that it starts to get hard a bit - so you bang her at least three hours nonstop
Fucking really with full power
The girl that kind of rides, that she has never received before.
We continue the trip ...
Fuck off you bitches
I have in fact that kind of asshole radar
With you it starts alarm red
Luckily there comes a time for you to punish
So police officers, rolling slowly on the parking lot checking out register plates
Clouds and those castles made of stone
Spending lonely nights in jails
The active ingredient of Subutex is buprenorphine.
Like heroine and morphine it produces a pleasant and euphoric feeling
(Jani:) I started to use drugs when I was 14 years. old.
About 5 years of drug use and soon
I will turn 20 years.
Since then I've been taking those (notkuja) drugs.
Subutex and Temgesic.
Rovaniemi has been an amphetamine (piri) city fucking long already.
But drugs came here kinda late - but surely, anyway.
We are spending a relaxing night among friend with good food and Subutex
(Jani:) Hey, Hurtsi. How much of
S you have there?
(Hurtsi:) Yeah I have some.
I was thinking if I would have bought half a S from you.
- Would it be okay for you?
- I wouldn't really want to sell.
Sell!
(Jani:) Do not touch with wet hands
Look at it now.
(Hurtsi:) Well. Do you have the money?
(Jani:) No shit, what a guy dude.
Asking me this amount of..
(Jani:) You have to get profit from a friend.
Well it does not matter, fuck.
Fuck what kind of guy that Hurtsi.
Ask 30€ from me (for half) after paying 50€ a chip himself
(Jani:) Is the Dr. Dre the bad guy here? - No. He is the boss here.
Dre is a good man here.
He is a good man here, Dr. Dre here.
Eminem is a crazy gun nut / nutcase here.
(Hurtsi:) Snoopy is just smoking, fuck. And lounging
Well it is just the right thing for Snoopy, fuck (vittu).
Enimem is fuck th best white rapper in the world.
Of course after me even though I cannot rap at all
So what, you are asking for 30€ for the half S?
Yeah.
Hohhoi, fuck.
What a dude
Fuck, whooo, what a friend.
- I also can be irritating sometimes
- Yeah, "sometimes".
Fuck, yeah.
Fuck, all the time, satan.
"All the time, "the fuck?
Take care of the shit as they are supposed to be taken care of.
That is what I have done, satan.
Fucking idiot, bloody hell.
Fuck, dares to ask from me...
Well, it does not matter, fuck.
Due to a "misunderstanding" after a failed job
2 fingers were cut from Jani with an axe
He plans to move away from Rovaniemi
(Jani:) It is all about your psyché how you take your existence here
If you just go to your flat doing nothing and you do not not eat and thus, - and constantly thinks that, fuck,
I am feeling bad, I am feeling bad -
Of course you feel bad.
When you try to be among the living and eat, and so on - then you can cope somehow.
And you are forced to cope.
Rovaniemi, This is this kind of fucking little city (tuppukylä), fuck.
In winter, a lot of snow fuck, and in the summer fucking cold.
What else can you really tell about Rovaniemi?
Here, you have spent your life, -
Months and years just flashing in your eyes.
Yet, they pass fucking slowly.
This is that sort of a place from where you constantly want to leave from
If you've never visited - and lived anywhere else than in Rovaniemi, then fucking hell!
I wouldn't at least have the energy for that
It would be the same as shooting a bullet in the head or something.
This is just too distant.
I would like get into the center of things and activities.
In principle ...
... Eye of the storm.
Due to the raids of the narcotic police
Subutex has temporarily run out from the city
Withdrawal symptoms come
Luckily there is a legal alternative:
Pams (diazepam) and alcohol
I have lost gloves.
Jou, jou, jou...
(Hurtsi:) What is my hat?
Now it is like starting.. the partying
Hurtsi, How much of the diazepams you still have?
- If you could like lend me 5?
- Fuck you!
Was that a direct response or indirect? (Hurtsi:) Think about it.
Well see what the evening brings.
(Announcer :)... Whether Lapin Kansa was faster than Santa Claus this time?
Vili, and then against Lepsu.
Now that is very tight couple.
Huhhahhei and bottle of rum!
But only after work, thank you.
What the fuck is there to see in reindeers?
We checked whether the guy would have wallets...
Oh, fuck.
Oh, my God!
He fell down?
Hey, from where the reindeers start?
(Announcer:) A middle-aged, educated gentleman - is in the army for 24 months.
Think about the neighbor boy from the east (Russia).
He goes to the army, and he never gets back to civilian life.
Now it is tight race.
Now, hard to tell the winner, but soon it will be announced.
Indeed, there is Veikka with the information
Information finale ...
(Jani's friends are singing
Pelle Miljoona's song [Moottoritie on Kuuma]:)
I would like to explain but the ships wait
You are a dream to me but the world is true
But the world is true
Cocaine, LSD, Ecstasy, yep
Always fresh Koskenkorva tastes as a snack
Too much, just a bit too much
I eat mushrooms
Too much, just a bit too much
I calm down with pills
Every night, when too much I fell in love
Life of an artist,
Me, Melleri and Morrison
(Jupe:) You!
(Jani:) What?
What did he say?
Call in ten minutes!
I heard today that you have called me a homerobber!
Nonsense. We settled this yesterday, when I was here.
We agreed that it is settled.
- I heard about it today.
So from whom? - What fucking difference it is from whom I heard it from?
Fuck him, who is saying those things
Why in the fuck have you said such thing?
Well you could have stolen all my stuff if you'd have wanted to.
Well you blamed me. That I would had used your drugs (töötit) as well. satan.
Haven't we already talked about this?
- Yeah.
So why do you blame a homerobber? - I do not blame you.
You have accused me as a homerobber.
- I do not accuse you as such.
You have accused! - What is coming from my mouth?: "I don't accuse".
Just to piss you off.
I don't have the energy for this. - You have accused me to be a homerobber.
(Jani:) Fuck believe, fuck, who you believe, satan.
Hey, if Joni told that to me ...
You heard me?
- I heard you.
I have fuck, in a fit of anger, fuck - might have said, when the drugs had disappeared.
But I did not mean it.
We settled this yesterday evening?
I did not know yesterday evening - that you had called me a homerobber.
I might have said in a fit of anger - when the drugs (töötit) disappeared.
But I don't mean that really.
I'll trust you
100%, fuck.
And still accuse me of being a homerobber.
Fuck, if that is your decision, we are out of here.
I have not called anyone a homerobber.
You have.
In a fit of anger
I might have said - but we settled this yesterday.
- I just heard it.
I've said it when fuck, - when I was equally furious as I going to be soon fuck.
I'm getting pissed of this as well.
- Do you think that I am not pissed off because of this?
You have accused me of being a homerobber.
I thought of you as a my mate.
I do not think you as homerobber fuck.
I really do not.
Well, why do you say that then?
- I might have said, in a fit of anger.
You can also in a fit of anger say - if you get angry at me, fuck I will kill that Raappana.
But in the end you do not mean it.
I've never said anything even close to that
- But you might. It is a metaphor.
In similar fashion
I might have said, -
That fuck, satan, Jupe, is a homerobber, perkele!
But still I haven't really meant it.
Okay.
- It was a misunderstanding.
Really if I hear that kind of matter ...
You do not really hear that. You are one of the three here that I trust on.
But if I once again hear...
I guarantee that you will lose rest of your fingers also.
Joni doesn't have anything to drink.
Where is Joni?
- At Vilsu's place.
Where does Vilsu live?
- There where the Kansankatu's Neste is (gas station).
I go and get it.
You ain't go going anywhere with a car
- I have a stolen car out there
You are not going anywhere with a car!
- I drove it here just a while ago.
Despite that!
- I am in good condition
You are not going to drive!
I'll go drive a car.
I go and do some fucking crazy job
Burglary to a storage of an industrial area fails when the cops arrive to the place
POLICE
Jani is being arrested for 3 days.
Three days of controversy.
Let's go somewhere for a cup of coffee.
- I lost the laptop.
I ain't giving as I only have that one
- Oh, fuck, you promised earlier.
I said that if you had not taken any,
I could offered you one.
But you already had taken one
- Yeah, but I was so sick yesterday.
I knew you that if I could keep a cool face
I would be out there in 3 days.
And I would even have
Subutex (teemuja) waiting for me.
That there is nothing to worry about here.
They can keep me arrested for 3 days and not a day longer
(Joonas:) And you denied everything?
- I admitted the attempt of theft.
However the limit of grand theft was passed, - when the guy got loose and got the goods with him
It was not completely useless thing as
I benefited about 1000€ from that.
(Joonas:) Good one.
On that station you have to be quiet always, when you are there
After the first hearing report -
I just said that: "Nothing to add nor to nothing to tell."
(Police) "You take that line?"
Jani: I take this line, fuck.
Today the examiner was changed.
Initially it was Jani Pääkkönen, who changed to Risto Turunen.
Turunen said: "Raappana.
Name the other guy now."
"Together it is done and together it is suffered"
It does not really work so, it is kinda tacit agreement
If someone gets caught, he will take the blame.
Now, it happened to be me.
Fuck, loyalty to the another guy
Here you keep your mouth shut.
Nothing much else about it
To control the Subutex problem, the addicts are offered a free sedative medication
(Jani:) Could you give water or something?
Or will these go with tea?
They are not needed, satan, to be put down with anything.
Just on top of the tongue to saviour the flavour.
(Joonas:) Nami Nami (Yummy yummy).
They go down like that if you haven't got them for some while
Ten pills in the mouth at the same time and suck.
Pam (Diapam, diazepam) is the best tasting medicine, that I know.
Yeah, if you start comparing the different tastes.
Well, no, Rivatril is better.
Fuck, it is number one.
Rivas are fucking good.
They will leave a taste which is a mixture of liquorice and ... mint.
Like you would have eaten a candy.
(Joonas:) I think the best are Tenox (temazepam) pills.
They taste like chalk tablets.
(Joonas:) No, they taste like sweets.
Just try Rivatril.
Riva is fucking good.
Yes, but there is the chalk flavor in Tenox which I do not like that much.
Oh, and then it gets all mushy in your mouth.
Pams dissolve nicely, like layer by layer.
All the time that kind of hard chunk.
At the department (hospital?) the people wonder - when I am so spaced out in the morning
- that what I am really taking.
I guess I'm a bit spaced out, when I take 40 mg of Tenox (temazepam) -
200 mg Sparine (promazine) and fuck what all else.
And I still cannot sleep.
So I guess I am a bit spaced out in the morning
Fuck, that annoyed me.
(Hurtsi:) Sparine makes you quite spaced out.
And when you're not sleeping - even though you are on such drugs, that even an apartment building should fall.
Eyes just are gaping open.
Sick, fuck.
(Joonas:) Why could not you sleep?
The withdrawal symptoms were so strong.
I was just unable to sleep.
Court house
Prosecutor have demanded for a prison sentence to Jani. He is waiting for the court solution.
Drunken driving and
Endangering traffic - a couple of thefts, drug crimes drug use crimes - and more of the shit.
Bit of everything.
If I would go to prison now,
I would go to Oulu.
In Pelso Prison you would have to work.
And if you do not, then cell door is closed.
Oulu: that is like a rest home.
A lot of go just to spend their winter there, - when you get shelter for the winter and regular food.
To go there to sit a bit.
(Jani:) The family is still the dearest to me.
It is pretty much the only sacred thing in my life.
Where other people can not reach.
And to where they have no business.
They do not know anything about that.
But it is irritating for my mom to be here, if... she has that kind of weigth over here, so it's not good.
Those older people have the habit - of blaming themselves for their children's mistakes.
I started stealing fucking young.
Now, I have become quite of master in it.
As a kid you only stole candy or something like that.
It was quite stupid back then
When you started to proper thefts, you did not think of the money - but the excitement and feeling what you will get from it.
Adrenaline rush of its own kind.
Useless to think about it anymore.
You have chosen your lifestyle
I just hope to get on a trip fast.
I just want to get out from here.
As fast as possible.
But I should get some money.
That is the problem.
(Alert:) Solution at Hall 2
What ...
(Joonas:) What is the situation there?
They sentenced me to jail.
(Joonas:) What?
- Sentence to jail.
District court sentences Jani to jail for a year.
The sentence will be put in order in summer.
- Whassup, whassup?
- Let's go and do (iv) drugs (töötit).
Ah drugs? Then I get the fuck out from this gang.
(Jani -> buddy:) Could you borrow me 50€?
At the moment I do not have a penny of money.
The money that I will receive will go all to those costs/charges.
This is running very well!
Well it is 2 gig PC.
What game is that?
- Night Fire, James Bond.
Fuck, the phone rings.
Fuck the debts are putting pressure on me.
I should quickly get 60€ from somewhere.
(Ahi:) How can I live - if the Social Welfare Office gives me 80€? I can't life with that
I do not start to live with my woman's money, that is a sure thing.
Oh, What will I do?
If I mean to live,
I then have to steal.
That is where it goes again that I am in prison again, thank to you.
(Jani:) You cannot blame anyone for that.
(Jani.) You wanted to get a break from every day life, in principle.
When you discovered your own thing, it was fucking awesome.
If you take Subutex, initially, very first times - you get into that kind of state of trance.
You can travel anywhere in your mind
And when daydreaming (lucid dreams), you see just what you want to see.
You are awake, but still you are like sleeping.
You dream while you are awake.
It is fucking awesome.
To your whole body, you get that kind of fucking good feeling.
I cannot, satan, explain.
It is just, fuck ...
But now, in the long run you are not noticing them anymore.
I was at once addicted to morphine as well.
When you took it for a couple of days, - then suddenly you had been taking it one week and two weeks.
Mind was all flat.
You weren't thinking anything at all.
It was, fuck, so evil a substance, that you will die to it.
At least to it if not to anything else
During the spring the use of drugs is increasing
Jani's debt. He tries to get some money.
The date of jail time is getting closer day by day.
Howdy ho!
The one syringe ...
Another thing is whether they are mine.
Hey, now I got a murky flashback.
Fuck, it is quite sticky. Yuck.
Party, party.
When you draw through the filter, so the chalk does not come there.
That is why today I draw my Subutex and other IV drugs through a filter.
Chalk is fucking bad for your blood vessels and your eyes.
You might start too to see kind of blurry.
Do you still get returns from it?
This is, fuck, a dream place.
Well, and still a second round.
That certainly all the shit has been used.
Hey, everybody!
It's a nice day today!
It's a shining day, and summer's coming.
Yeah.
You have a car, right?
- Yeah.
You have syringes+needles?
- No we have none.
Are you under Pams (sedatives)?
- No ...
I have stayed up whole the last night, taking amphetamine.
2.5 grams of amphetamine.
Took amphetamine all night long.
Now Mika went back over there.
(Joonas:) Oh, back to jail?
- Yeah.
(Joonas:) How long has he left?
He sits how long of his sentence?
Can you give me the phone,
I will call to Kymis?
Everyone owes me money.
- I soon start to beat up people.
- I do not owe you any money.
Then they, fuck, are crying to me:
"we do not get money from anywhere".
Now would be sitution when if we had the bazooka.
(Joonas:) What?
If we had the bazooka, - it would happen as we talked about yesterday.
... Pay me the debt in cash.
- Yes, but to me you could not.
Let's go to the drugstore.
Family package of syringes and 20 ...
(Joonas:) What? - Cups, which
I can use it with a filter to draw that Subutex.
No.
Is someone watching me?
Is someone watching me?
(Joonas:) Yes.
(Joonas:) Now.
Family package of syringes.
And 20 that kind of cups.
Or give just 10 in matter of fact.
Need syringes and needles?
- Yeah, five both of them.
To the whole family.
To father, mother and to three children.
And a small bag for them, thank you.
- 2.70€? Well then it is even.
Thank you. There you go. Need a receipt?
- Not needed, I go to use drugs.
Can you hold that? Fuck.
Calm driving style, we are not in a rush to anywhere.
(Joonas:) What?
- I said to Jani.
Jani perhaps should drive a bit more calmly.
We are seriously not in a rush to anywhere.
(Jani:) It is quieter?
(Joonas:) What?
Calmer than this? (Joonas:)
Just normally. (shout)
(Joonas:) Well that is what I meant.
I am driving, fuck, as usual.
Reflexes were in order, so the bitch survived.
(Jani:) It is all about your psyché how you take your existence here
You cannot end your use here.
All your friends use - and if you're a a while without drugs then someone will offer you.
And when you ask yourself, it is sure that you will not be offered.
The people here are so crooked/twisted that the fucking hell ...
You cannot distinguish friend from your enemy.
The next day he can be your enemy.
I guess you become like that as well as the others.
I do not know - whether or not my friends have gone, fuck, anywhere outside this city.
They are trying to get out from here, it is evident.
And a big part people have gone.
But they won't leave as I would leave.
They still will stay in Finland.
But I wouldn't be able even to stay in Finland.
Two weeks later Jani calls and says:
"Pack your stuff, we leave in an hour"
I have been waiting fucking long for this moment.
Yesterday I succeeded in sort of thing that I comment on here -
But that can I say that
But we can get going!
I am feeling so good, aren't you also??
Fucking awesome! Throw a couple of Pams to your face to relieve a bit your tension.
Or Rivatril. Take one Pam.
(Joonas:) I'll take couple of lines.
You fuck head.
Today we are in Finland.
Tomorrow we are in Paris.
Jani has managed to steal 5'000€ from the safe of a local supermarket. He plans to escape from Finland with this money.
Nothing can go wrong anymore.
(Joonas:) What were you afraid before?
That I would manage to get caught before we were able to go.
It takes as long as for us as want to spend on the road.
I will spend at least as long as we have the money.
And it won't be a problem to get more money.
If the money runs out, then we go to work.
I believe that I will stay on this trip.
I just have a backpack of clothes, as you can see.
Backbag full of clothes.
And in the wallet about
20'000 of old money (~3'600€)
About.
Now we are in Stockholm.
I've never been so far from my home
Fuck hello what a place!
This train station ... fuck ... Whooo.
This is the size of Rovaniemi.
That much I can say..
Let's go up there.
Things could not be any better, damn it!
We're are in Copenhagen tomorrow morning.
Walking at 07h inside to Christiania, fuck.
Marijuana smell starts to come on your face.
I will smoke a massive joint, unbelievable 'flowerpuffs'.
Bevar Christiania
= Save Christiania
Fuck, we are now in free area.
Everyone knows each other.
They are just saying hello to each other.
Have smoked already morning joints and go with smiles on their faces
This is a fucking awesome place! Fuck!
I want to live here.
Really.
Would they let me build my own little cottage?
Greetings to the police of Rovaniemi.
You fuck heads.
(Jani:) Not like I have anything in Rovaniemi any longer.
There is something like materialistic, but like ...
My family has split up.
Mother drinking.
I love them all, but I have my life.
We are just in
20 minutes in Paris.
Fuck, and an hour from that,
I will get Subutex.
I haven't taken any for four days.
But yes, it hasn't really mattered.
There has been enough of eyecandy and all other fun stuff.
But we are like fifteen minutes from Paris.
To control to severe heroine problem the state of France provides free Subutex treatment for the addicts
Some of them sell their Subutex to buy stronger drugs like heroine and crack
We have arrived to the source of illegally sold Subutex in North Europe
I want a room for two and TV.
Two people, one TV?
What does she say?
Not even a fuck comes out of this, let's take some other hotel.
I want to take Subutex!
Understand English?
I want a fix.
Pretty shitty, but it does not matter. Close the door.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Subutex is here.
8 mg packet, no VAT.
Pull out the cap.
Then the pump.
Then pretty generous.
Needle, out. Water.
Underpressure. Mixing a little.
Then loose a bit. Then
The needle to the head, then mix and consume.
And you are ready to enjoy!
The big bed is for me by the way.
Look at these!
Voila!
How long does it take, that it begins to work? - About 5 minutes.
But it started already to affect as immediately I started to feel good.
Well, what could be better?
We're in Paris.
There's so fucking much of Subutex.
Show them, to all the people.
And I am here watching television here.
Gradually begin to feel the effect.
And smoking a cigarette.
By the way I have also marijuana.
Flower. I will show you that too.
Woody, slash, flower, slash, weed.
Samba, samba, leeo.
Fuck, I have been waiting for this, fuck ... Let's say a .. lifetime.
Soon I take another shot.
Whooo.
We are now, fuck, like at the core.
This is like being in the United States.
Whooo.
I just went to the top of the Eiffel Tower restroom to take a shot of Subutex.
And I filmed everything on tape.
(Sings Elvis
Only You song.)
(Jani:) Yes i had my mouth wide open when we came here.
The amount of people and the fact that the streets, they are somehow ...
Like even this little street, full of life.
In Rovaniemi, during this time, fuck, would be dark and quiet.
Like you notice you start comparing everything to Rovaniemi.
That thought I would like to remove.
The memories of the shitty times in Rovaniemi are fading away to the passic scenes of the South
The use of drugs is increasing day by day
First class!
First class!
Window seats!
I can not help laughing, we had such a good luck.
With 100€ an awesome hotel room.
And seaside views.
Soon you cannot even see the shore.
Now is time for Subutex.
And for you, time for lines.
Since getting off from the ship, almost one disc of Subutex used.
(Joonas:) Here?
- Yes. 3.. 2 short of full  disc.
This is pretty much the coolest a place where I have visited.
Where are we now?
Well, I do not remember.
Cefalu.
- Yes.
In cases like that
Subu takes your memory.
To things like that it affects fucking much.
May go, fuck, like one and a half years, you use it all the time, then nothing.
And then after the 1.5 years you try to take for example a pause of 1 week.
You have been 4 days without, and you start thinking about all sorts of things.
Like what have you done during last year and half.
But you can not remember.
Everything is all a fog to me.
I am so pissed off now, that I've been using here as well.
And a lot more for example that I used in Rovaniemi.
Tolerance is fucking high.
If I now want to quit - half a Subu won't ease a lot.
And I did not look for anything other than this trip itself...
Which is just fucking cool.
Actually those Subus could have been dropped also.
I could have used all the money just for this trip.
Just to buy one box.
Fuck, would have managed with it the amount you would have wanted to manage  - and stopped the drug use during this journey.
That would have emphasized the message.
There is more in the world than just to take drugs, fuck.
Itching in the nose.
Hey, I start doing lines now.
(Joonas:) Well?
- Yeah. Now starts.
Do you know what this
Raappana (his lastname) is doing now?
Throws syringes a side and will never use them ever again.
Radical cecision but this is how it is ...
(Joonas:) You really mean so?
Unusable!
I stopped injecting to veins.
The last traces were now left of this trip.
I've taken the last IV drug dose here at the shores of the Sicilian sea.
(Jani:) In addition to traveling -
I have seen myself living right in Spain.
I go to Spain,
I have an own house, a wife, - a bit of field (for agriculture).
I would be working, the wife would be maybe at home. A couple of children. That kind of things.
I 'm already up here, - so I would say that
50% of the dream is true already.
Uijui, I am tempted for one shot of Subu.
Weird feeling.
Doesn't feel like sniffing any lines, as it is stinging fucking weirdly.
Is not it ...
Yes, I still prefer to be without.
Fuck, if I could decide,
I would ban Subutex.
Or the abuse of Subutex.
Let's put it this way.
Or well.. I don't know.
So that no one would take them first.
Except some heroine addicts, who really need it - just so that they can normalize their lives.
But, like for myself
I do not recommend it.
I will quit.
I won't use it anymore, fuck.
It is as fucking simple as that.
Or not that simple. it is rather complex, but still I will do it and quit.
(Joonas:) Why do you want to quit? - Fuck, I do not know, fuck.
It might improve my own quality of life.
Look, what a fucking advertisement pub.
Club for the elderly, fuck, that kind.
Meant for those with career.
Look at the ads - and drink a couple of drinks. Fuck,
Just put more Gucci on you.
Fucking weirdos, satan.
What the fuck! (Mitä vittua?)
Now change the side, fuck!
Hell no..
That is some fucking nudist.
In Rovaniemi, like that Maire ...
She often, satan, home-brewed beer mug in hand, - naked at Samppari, but
Rovaniemi is quite ...
But fuck at night in Rome fuck we run across satan fuck some fucking nudist fuck nudist ...
Whooo, you can just laugh about it.
While wandering in the streets of Rome
I receive a text message to my phone:
"Fuck tell that Jani to contact me or I bash your appartment to pieces with an axe."
This is Jani.
Hello, Hello.
You were trying to reach me.
You were trying to reach me.
I haven't just been able to call you.
So. Haven't the money or other.
What else is happening there?
Who took it?
Who took the car?
I knew that I shouldn't have called, satan, at all.
Would be easier to be ignorant.
Not to care what happens elsewhere.
And you, fuck, even do not care.
That is why I paid all my debts, everything - so that here I would not have to stress about it, - that I have debt collectors after me and other shit.
So now some fucking Kuoksa ...
Oh, fuck I am irritated now!
That was the last option
To make that call, fuck.
If the cops are listening to
Pia's phone -
Now they know that I am in Italy.
Yeah, right, and now I have to be accountable to Kuoksa - for such a car, that I do not even have anymore.
I am not excited.
Not at all, fuck, not at all.
They think that they can somehow control me - but fuck, no fucking way.
Fucking no way.
There, satan, damn and let 'em get me here.
This is annoying in a way that, - that if you ever been involved in something - that would be kind the rest of your life, fuck.
Due to confusing chain of events in Rovaniemi,
Jani is again in debts and his friend has been threatened
But I guess he realizes that if I had been the snitch, -
I would have never got this far.
But that it that what he considers to be what ...
It is a different matter.
The way, how these fingers went, is a different matter.
I myself offered my fingers to them.
As a compensation.
So that is the difference.
In my opinion it is big but.
I was, like, hit me, if it makes you feel any better.
I do not know.
We arrive to Spain
Today, I haven't taken a single dose of drugs.
Oh, bloody hell, I was boiling this morning.
I almost lost my nerves and ultimately
I lost my nerves.
(Joonas:) Well, why was that? - Started to be really pissed, as there was no drugs.
Really pissed off.
Fuck
(Jani:) Then when I got an own, fuck, small house and, fuck, my own field - and so on ... that would be the center of my world.
We are now on the African side, in a Spanish town.
And there it is now.
This is the high quality shit.
From there when you smoke a puff,
I will say ...
Check it out now. Fuck, I say, that hello, hello, hello!
We have smack, smack, smack ...
'Horse' (polle, slang term for heroine).
(Joonas:) So why do you want to try?
Fuck, Wonder why?
(Joonas:) Huh?
- I do not know, just to try it.
(Joonas:) I mean why? - I guess want to try heroine.
(Joonas:) But why? - I do not know. I want the feeling (notkut).
(Jani:) It's hard to change way of life or lifestyle.
To change it completely.
It does not happen overnight.
You have to want it yourself, more than anything else.
And not, fuck, fear and run away.
For that reason many good things have been ruined.
I will build a small cottage for myself somewhere over to the green fields.
Field (agricultural) behind it.
And in front of it that kind of wooden fence.
Behind of it that kind
2m high stone fence.
I have a wife, and - not that much money, so quite a modest life, but - everyone are happy - and I go some little job - five days a week.
That's how I see my self.
I would then no longer exist,
I would be someone else.
HEART OF GLASS
I look into the distance, to the end of the world.
Before the day is over, the end will come.
First, time will tumble, and then the earth.
The clouds will begin to race...
...the earth boils over, this is the sign.
This is the beginning of the end.
The world's edge begins to crumble...
...everything starts to collapse...
...tumbles, falls, crumbles and collapses.
I look into the cataract.
I feel an undertow, it draws me, it sucks me down.
I begin to fall...
...a vertigo seizes upon me.
Now I look at one spot in the tumbling waters.
I seek one spot on which my eyes can rest.
I become light, lighter, lighter.
Everything becomes light,
I fly upwards.
Out of the falling and the flying, a new land arises.
Like the submerged Atlantis, the earth rises out of the waters.
I see a new earth.
Come here, don't be afraid.
Come here, I said.
The Giant has eyes like mill-stones.
Fingers...
...like tree branches.
His nose is a boulder.
The village lives in fear.
Rup says he's seen a Giant.
The time of the Giants is coming back.
The Giant breaks the trees and slays our cattle...
...and tears out our guts if he sees us.
He is sucking out our brains.
Tell Rup there are no Giants.
Next time he should note the position of the sun.
The sun was low and the Giant was just a shadow of a dwarf.
If nothing changes, you think that's a blessing.
But I see a fire...
...and I see the glass factory.
And I'll tell you something else...
A liar will cross one of the bridges, a thief will cross the other.
Tomorrow you will be finished, Ascherl!
I'll sleep off my hangover on your corpse.
Innkeeper, bring Wudy another beer.
I'll sleep on your corpse.
Hias said that I'll sleep on your corpse.
Hias sees into the future.
Provided we sleep in the hay.
And I must fall down onto the threshing place first.
Then you must fall on me.
If you don't fall soft, you'll be dead, too.
Muhlbeck is dead and no one knows the secret of the Ruby Glass.
He knew how to write.
He could have easily written it down.
How the Ruby glass is made.
Have you ever written a word?
But Muhlbeck could have talked,
Muhlbeck could.
My God...
The second glass.
This splendor is now relinquished from the world.
Now what will protect me now from the Evil of the universe?
You wouldn't dare.
I would.
Father, have you seen Adalbert?
Naked in bed again.
Get dressed!
Glass has a fragile soul.
It is unstained.
A crack is the Ain; after the Ain, there is no sound.
Will the future see the necessary fall of the factories...
...just as we see the ruined fortress as a sign of inevitable change?
People say that Hias has seen...
...nettles springing out of the factories.
The lilac bushes...
...will pine for the company of men, they say.
The Ruby must save us.
Tear Muhlbeck's house down, look for the secret in every crevice.
Dig three feet into the earth...
...on which his house stood...
...for Muhlbeck could have buried his secret.
Bring me the green davenport that he gave to his mother, Anamirl!
The chaos of the stars makes my head ache.
The hat.
The cane.
The master does not want his breakfast now.
Ludmilla may wear her hair down today.
Yes, she may wear her hair down.
A favor for the servant.
Why are you screaming?
Father, glass-blower Gigl thinks he has the secret of the Ruby glass.
This is the day to stand up.
No, I'd sooner stay in my chair.
I feel as though my backbone had crumbled.
Your backbone is not soft.
You won't collapse like a heap of stones.
For twelve years you have been sitting in this chair.
For twelve years
I have shown you your shoes.
I'll have you carried, as usual.
Are you sure?
Is this really Ruby glass?
Yes.
Is this really Ruby glass?
That's supposed to be Ruby?
Another one.
No! No!
Should I leave this place?
Madness is rampant in the village.
The factory owner wants a new furnace, but there are no builders.
Suddenly,
I see a fire flowing in the brook...
...and the wind pushing the fire on.
I see the trees burning like matchsticks.
I see many people running up a hill.
Breathless, they stop at the top...
...and, paralyzed, they turn to stone, one beside the other.
A whole forest of stone.
Then it becomes dark and still.
Down below, everything has perished.
There is no man, no house, only some debris.
Yes, and then I see someone running on the road below...
...with a burning branch in his hand...
...crying: ""Am I really the last one, the only one left? ""
Adalbert.
Send for the herdsman Hias; that he may see the mystery of the Ruby glass.
Even if we must tear
Muhlbeck from his grave...
...so that Hias can read his brain.
How strange, a whole town made of glass...
...with people living in it.
How can people live in glass houses?
Here's the church made of glass.
Animals live in the church...
...all kinds of animals: hares, chickens, deer...
...birds, cows...
...but there are no people in the church.
The streets are deserted.
Everything is covered in snow.
Ludmilla.
Let it be; there is more to break today.
Leave the mansion.
The master could slip and end up sitting on your face.
Why the sniveling?
Better that the servant prays for us to find the secret of the Ruby.
So much will happen, Hias is outside.
Already?
He knew?
He didn't need a messenger?
Master, please send a hunter to slay the bear.
The bulls are frightened...
...and Sam and I can't promise that he won't kill a bull...
...or cause a stampede.
On the day of the bear, a bull will run as far as Mainz.
Muhlbeck is dead.
He has taken his secret with him.
Muhlbeck abandoned us, but you are to see the secret of the Ruby.
I don't know the ingredient.
You know it for ten florins.
Then you know it for a thousand.
Do you want our people to eat oatmeal bread again...
...that gives them headaches?
Then tell me the secret...
...so we can make Ruby glass again; you can become foreman.
And I will carry a millstone to Trier.
I've only come because of the hunter.
I want the Ruby again.
I want the red glass, understand?
I need a glass to contain my blood, or it will trickle away.
The sun is hurting me.
You will never see the sun again.
Rats will bite your ear lobes.
Wudy is dead.
No, Ascherl is the one who has been nabbed.
Hias predicted that the one underneath falls first.
And look, the other falls on top of him, he falls softly.
Wudy survived it.
Let's separate them.
The one whose arm falls first is the dead man.
Don't curse in the face of the dead.
Now we know.
What Hias foresees, happens.
Here I am.
It's Toni.
You buried our foreman, Muhlbeck, the week before last.
Now they do not know what to do.
Hias predicted it.
You know about the Ruby glass?
The Ruby is the master's malady.
The davenport is here.
Bring it in.
Bring it in.
I'm delighted with this letter.
Adalbert, give me the letter-opener.
We'll read this message.
Can he decipher that?
If a letter reaches someone with the words scattered around...
...it should make you think.
Are you going up to the woods again?
I do not need the flour now.
I see that I only get away when the snow lies.
I'll put it back, then.
Your Muhlbeck is dead...
They have taken away your davenport.
Yes, he always sat there.
When night falls, the faces will die.
By day the rain pours...
...yet the land is drying up.
You have been invited because you describe the Ruby so beautifully.
I cannot hear enough of it.
The land of the Ruby... my land.
And all the people... dance in the red glow...
...and live in it.
Their blood, their life, everything is in the glass.
In the red, in the color.
This land is the only one.
Everything is in this land and everything is Ruby.
Your prayer has worked a miracle.
For an hour,
I have known something I never knew.
I can sell my secret to all glassworks.
Break all you can.
I shall take ten loads of
Ruby glass to Mt. Arber...
...and thrown into the lake, so it is dyed red.
Adalbert, did you understand?
The lake is dyed red.
The glass for the lake must go this very day.
Take everything from the store.
And another thing.
Re-stuff the davenport and mend it...
...and take it to Anamirl with ten florins for compensation.
Tell her I no longer wish her dead Muhlbeck to go to the devil.
May he be surrounded by a host of angels.
I have it.
It is here.
Here.
And inside here...
...and here.
We all...
I have already sent for the Plossberg furnace builders.
The mistress will be surprised when she returns.
She will see nothing left standing.
Lunatic.
When she dismounts, she will fall into the mud.
And you'll be on a boat, puking.
Anything else?
- Will there be any free beer today?
- Yes.
The master is deranged.
And in the glassworks there's been Beelzebub.
He sent out ten men with racks of glass...
... but they were not so stupid as to throw valuable glass in the lake.
They will smuggle it over the border and sell it.
Ludmilla, go before he wants something from you.
Lumilla, make yourself beautiful; the master wants your company.
I must provide some music.
In the meadow there will be someone who can play the hurdy-gurdy.
But I will have to sing with it.
Harp-Tony is in the inn.
Tell him to come, it will be to his advantage.
Now you have a soft seat again.
The night is coming on slowly today.
It creeps into the village...
...and in the stables people softly cuddle with the animals.
In the factory they are working again against fear...
...but they know that their work is in vain.
I told them the factory will burn down in the night.
But, like sleep-walkers, people walk towards their doom.
Well, and then?
Then the little one starts a war...
...and the big one across the ocean extinguishes it.
Then you will not get a loaf for two hundred florins.
Then a strict master comes...
...who takes people's shirts and their skin with them.
After the War you think there will be Peace, but there will not be.
Drink up.
I miss Ascherl!
You should not have smothered him.
I miss Ascherl!
He should have been here today.
Can't you go out to him?
He cannot come inside.
Bring me some Ascherl!
Even if I believe all that you say,
I do not believe that.
Believe it or not, that is your affair.
I tell you what I see;
I do not know if it will happen.
And then?
The peasants will dress like towns people...
...and the towns people will be like apes.
Women will wear trousers and boots.
The peasants will stand in their dung heaps with polished boots.
The peasants will eat cakes and discuss politics.
Who will play for us?
I will play for these two.
Keep playing!
Keep going!
They all fight; there is war in every house.
No man will like another man.
The elegant and fine people will be murdered.
He who has smooth hands will be slain.
The peasants will encircle their houses with a high fence...
...and shoot at the towns people from their windows.
The towns people will beg; let me plough the ground...
...but they will be slain.
No man will like another man.
If two people are on one bench and one asks the other to move over...
...and the other does not, it will be his death.
That will be the time of the Clearing of the Benches.
She is cooling off, then she will not crack any more.
That is the pure ingredient.
What are factories still good for?
Paulin must dance naked on the table!
You will not be able to tell between summer and winter.
Everyone will have a different head...
...and the forest will get sparse, like the beggar's gown.
The small will be tall again.
When the Redcoats come with their red coats...
...then you must run fast and take a loaf of bread with you.
Whoever has three loaves and drops one on the way, must not stoop.
Even if you loose the second one, you must leave it behind...
...you can subsist with one loaf...
...because it does not last long.
The few who survive must have an iron head.
People become ill...
...but no one can help them.
Those who will survive...
...will stick together and call each other Brother and Sister.
- Take everything off.
- So we can see something!
The factory is on fire!
The factory is on fire!
If it is burning, I would like to be there, where are my shoes?
Where are my shoes?
For twelve years there has been no fire.
And my shoes are gone.
People settle down as though never wanting to leave this world.
But over night the clearing of the world begins.
From the Orient, a huge bird appears and shits into the sea.
The sea rises as high as a house, and boils.
The earth trembles and a big island half drowns.
The big city with the iron tower is in flames...
...but the fire was started by its own men, and the city is leveled.
In Italy the clergy is killed and the churches collapse.
The Pope sits in a cell.
During his flight he consecrates a goat as bishop.
People starve.
The three days of darkness draw nearer.
Where the black box drops, a green and yellow dust arises.
The weather will change.
Vineyards will be grown here...
...and there is fruit that I do not know.
Ludmilla.
Ludmilla lies dead in the master's office...
...and Toni plays her one song after another on his harp.
Hias has wished this calamity on us.
I merely predicted it.
He has Devil's eyes, he has the Evil Eye. Lock him up!
I do not see any more.
It is so dark.
I must see something again.
I must go to the woods.
I have to go to the woods.
I want to see the woods again.
Don't you want to see any people?
I like you.
You have a heart of glass.
And now I'm going to roast the bear.
In the night someone looks across the forest and sees not a single light.
And when he sees a juniper bush in the twilight...
...he runs to see if it isn't a human being, there are so few left.
In the forest, roosters crow, but the people have perished.
Something else occurs to me.
I see it again.
A coachman stops and gets down from his coach...
...he knocks down on the ground with his whip and says:
"There was once the big town of Straubing."
Now I see the rocky island again.
I see it quite clearly.
A rocky island far out in the sea, and a second, smaller island.
They lie on the far edge of the inhabited world.
On one island, for centuries, some forgotten men have lived.
And because they live on the far edge of the inhabited world...
...word has not reached them that the earth is round.
They have retained the belief that the earth is flat...
...and that the ocean far beyond ends in a yawning abyss.
I see a man on top of the rock.
For years he stood alone, looking out over the sea...
...day after day, always in the same place.
He is the first one to doubt.
Then, years later, three other men join him.
For many years they gaze across the sea from the rock.
Then, one day, they decide to risk the ultimate.
They want to reach the edge of the world, to see if there is really an abyss.
Musicians accompany their departure.
Then the men set out, pathetic and senseless.
In a boat that is far too small.
It may have seemed like a sign of hope...
...that the birds followed them out into the vastness of the sea.
Is there a festival today?
I don't think so. And yet, every year for 27 years...
...she comes on this day, to feed the poor.
How could Bharati possibly forget!
Those were momentous times.
Her father Ramnath
Rai was the state's...
...Chief Minister for 14 years...
...but her generation's heady romance with leftism...
...had turned Bharati into a rebel.
Together with her charismatic mentor...
...the idealistic Bhaskar Sanyal, she stormed her father's public rally.
Indian politics was going through a historic churning... but Ramnath Rai was blissfully complacent.
Only his astute political advisor and...
Bharati's foster-brother, Brij
Gopal had sensed the turning winds.
Comrade Bhaskar will try to draw you into an argument.
Do not fall into his trap.
I've been a politician for 20 years, Brij Gopal.
I'm not a fool.
Mr. Rai, we have no intention of disturbing your rally.
But, if you permit me,
I'd like to ask you... a few questions on behalf of the people.
Hey! Hey! Stop him!
Let him come.
The public on whose behalf, he wants to raise questions... already knows the answers to them.
And those who have been enticed by his red flag... should also be aware of
Ramnath Rai's political sacrifices.
The issue isn't about the colour of the flag, Mr. Rai.
Poverty, hunger and unemployment do not discriminate...
...on the basis of colour.
These people are besieged by their own empty stomachs, Mr. Rai.
Offer them two slices of bread... make a couple of sweet promises... and they will pick up a flag of any colour!
What kind of poverty is this, friends... which, in spite of their schemes funded by millions...
...billions of rupees... just refuses to go away!
So as of this moment...!
- Sir will leave now.
...we absolve you of any worry about our poverty
Enough is enough!
Come on, uncle.
Switch the mikes off.
As soon as the ballot is cast, you throttle democracy.
Switch the mikes off!
Don't be under any illusion that...
Have you no shame at all!
Conspiring against your own father!
Do you know that your revered leader is not worth even a penny!
What I do know is that for you people's worth is measured...
...only with money.
Shut up!
What?
There is no Comrade Bharati here.
Don't ever call here again!
Sir?
What are you doing?
Cooking khichdi...
Will you have some?
- Here, allow me...
- If you cook this...
Oh, come on... Just let me...
It's going to rain.
Let me drop you home.
- Are you crazy? -
It's the first rain, sir.
I love the rain.
Why don't you join me?
Don't be childish... you'll catch cold.
Come on. Get inside.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
You're crazy! You'll catch a cold...
Nothing will happen to me...
Bharati...
I take full responsibility for what happened.
You devoted yourself completely to me.
But, I turned out to be weak... and ended up betraying your trust.
What is done is done.
But, I will never be free of this guilt.
I'm going... leaving everything... and everyone.
I have obviously failed.
My penance awaits me.
Bhaskar.
Get it here, hurry up...
Where's my baby?
Mr. Brij Gopal took him away.
I just wanted to see him once...
Brij Gopal convinced the grieving Bharati into...
...a marriage with Chandra Pratap.
Of course, it helped that he was the younger brother of Bhanu Pratap... the aggressive leader of the fast-rising Rashtrawadi Party.
No one realised that Brij Gopal had killed three birds with one stone.
Besides securing Bharati's future... he also got Ramnath Rai's doddering party a strong alliance.
And of course, Bhanu
Pratap's Rashtrawadi Party... harvested a windfall of much-needed election funds.
Wherever he is, he must be okay.
Just send him your blessings.
O Holy mother Ganga... please look after my son... wherever he may be.
- Sooraj! Sooraj!
- Sooraj! Sooraj!
Where are you going?
Sooraj is playing a kabaddi match.
First give me something to eat.
I have to go to the airport.
Who's coming?
The boss' younger son, Samar.
- Is it?
He is coming from the US, for the big boss' birthday.
Sooraj is like the sun!
The new beacon of hope for...
...Dalits and the lower castes.
We need bright and strong young leaders like him...
...who will take us forward.
Hey!
Huh?
Where's the car?
Hey!
Get away! Move!
Have you lost it or what?
What if something happened to the car?
He's our racing champion... faster than the wind!
Champion, my foot!
The car's a mess!
Clean it now!
It's time for the flight. Samar is returning from the US today.
I don't wash rich people's cars.
They are our masters, son.
Our livelihood depends on them.
I am my own master, father.
And the truth is, their livelihood depends on us.
It's impossible to argue with you!
Stop haranguing my son, will you?
- I'll clean it. -
Give it to me, mother.
This is for you. It's time you got a new watch.
You never forget, young master.
Just because I live far away, how can I forget you people!
We miss you, too.
It's wonderful that you've come in time for the Diwali festival.
Nothing like that.
I'm here only for
Uncle Bhanu's birthday.
My thesis is due next week.
This year too... you won't be here for Diwali.
Who's that driving like a maniac?
Appears to be Indu...
Couldn't you have waited for me?
And how was I to know that you were...
You should know!
Understood?
D'you know...
I was driving at 200 kmph to reach you!
Who on earth gave you a license?
License to... drive or... to kiss you?
You're insane!
You're mad.
So I am.
Mad about you!
I missed you.
"I am expecting some happy news too."
"Yes, it is."
"Some things make you cry...
...some times it is like a story."
"Yes, it is."
There you are!
- Hello aunty! - Hello.
Here's your parcel
- safe and sound.
I'm off to the salon.
See you in the evening... at Uncle Bhanu's party.
This girl is a tornado!
In the last 30 years...
Bhanu and Chandra Pratap's
Rashtrawadi party had captured...
...power thrice in the state.
Bhanu Pratap's public charisma and Chandra Pratap's...
...astute tactical skills... had served them well indeed.
When their party couldn't win the last election... they installed Ramnath Rai's party in the government... by supporting it from outside.
Now, when they asked him to,
Ramnath Rai was reluctant to resign.
Bhanu Pratap's son Veerendra knew exactly how to handle such problems.
All the dozen legislators of his party are in the bus.
Take them to the guest house and feed them.
Welcome, grandpa!
Grandpa, I've hijacked your entire party.
You're a general without an army!
What's the use of tilting at windmills now?
Veerendra, show some respect.
Well... let him respectfully retire then!
Father-in-law, come.
Let's go inside and talk.
It's an outrage the way you are... trying to topple my government!
Only with your blessings, of course.
Look here... this time my party bosses will insist on 100 seats.
You can't score even 10 seats...
Aiming for a century!
Keep your national party in Delhi. Here we...
Veeru, enough.
Come, father-in-law.
You never call me!
It's only through your Uncle
Brij that I get news of you.
Mother, it's the time difference between here and America.
Uncle Brij is a nocturnal bird.
It's easier to talk with him.
Hey!
Brother!
Already pouncing on mom's parathas!
You've become thin! Hasn't he, mom?
Let him be... Come, eat.
No, I've to go to the Party HQ.
I just came to see him.
While Veerendra believed himself to be the heir...
...to the political throne...
Prithvi was jockeying for the same position.
Hence, it was imperative that his supporters get...
...nominated for these elections.
Create so much publicity that the party is forced to nominate them.
We'll fight to get that.
We'll create a chaos in the party high court.
We'll show them your power, Prithvi.
Great!
Let me go!
They're trying to stop me!
I told them I had to talk to you.
We're in a meeting. Please wait.
So... that's it then.
Yes, sir.
Move then. It's time for the party.
Okay, sir.
Jagat... call for my car, too.
- Okay, sir.
You seem to have forgotten me, sir.
There's going to be a fresh election, I hear.
Won't you let a woman volunteer contest?
I can win, sir. Just let...
Let me contest from Sitapur.
I'll definitely win.
I grew up there.
I was the students' union president.
Sir, please don't forget me this time.
The Sitapur ticket...
That's the bloody problem with politics.
Everyone treats it like public transport.
Just flag it down... and mount it!
I've worked very hard, sir.
And will continue to do so.
Let me.
You handled grandpa Rai like a seasoned politician.
Then, why don't you reward your son?
Everything belongs to him anyway.
Father, let me select the election candidates.
That's your uncle's prerogative.
That's why Prithvi...
But I won't let it go on like this.
So glad you're here.
It's your birthday, Uncle.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Hello.
- How are you? - Hello.
Mr. Sakseria...
Hello, uncle.
Bless you.
- Hello.
Just got his tax problems sorted out by the Chief Minister.
You never forget, Rajkumar...
- and now you'll say... -
Happy Birthday to you, sir.
Just saying happy birthday won't do.
Always at your service.
Have I ever disappointed you?
Please be seated... quiet...
After winning three elections... when the electorate rejected us... in the last election... we accepted their decision with humility.
And we helped...
Mr. Ramnath Rai form a coalition government... supporting it from outside.
But, as you know... in the last 18 months... this government has revealed it's true face.
Corruption has reached its zenith... and the people are in agony.
We can't bear to see the common man's pain any longer.
So, we have decided... to withdraw our support for Mr.
Rai's coalition government.
Long live Rashtrawadi!
The people know... that we aren't responsible... for this political turmoil.
Father!
- Brother! - Father! - Brother!
Call the hospital! Emergency...
Get the car!
Hello.
Hello.
Just as I handed in the resignation, I heard.
- At least, if I hadn't resigned...
- Father-in-law...
...please!
Increase the pressure.
Mr. Brij Gopal...
Blood pressure.
- Diastolic 140.
I came from Benaras only to see you... and here I hear about this crisis.
It's serious, Uncle...
I'll see.
Blood pressure.
While the heart has been revived... there's no movement in the body.
So, is he paralysed?
We'll have to wait for the ECG reports for that.
The government has fallen and fresh elections are certain.
But the leader of the state's largest political party... is fighting for his life.
- Without party president Bhanu Pratap...
- what does the future hold for the Rashtrawadi Party?
- State Hospital.
Aditi Priya. Star News.
Go ahead.
Before they try to pull a fast one... we should take control of the party.
We support you.
I'll see you all at the party office.
Yes, Mr. Bawal.
Hello?
What?
Under no circumstances should that meeting happen.
Book the entire
Intercontinental Hotel.
Got it?
Listen... round up every party member and take them to the hotel.
These impatient youngsters will destroy everything.
Now, more than ever, the party needs your guidance.
Turn around. Father has regained consciousness.
As soon as he became conscious, he called for everybody.
Chandu...
Yes, brother...
- The...
In these circumstances, the party...
Brother, please, we'll talk later...
- What? - take charge of... the party... as it's working president.
What's the need for this, father?
You... and Prithvi... will both be general secretaries.
Uncle!
Come on...
What have you done, father!
Take it back! Please...
This is a humiliation for me...
At least, make me the joint working president...
Veerendra... you're family! You should look beyond such things.
Everything will finish, then...
Father...
Father!
Father!
Go back... back to America...
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live the General Secretary!
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live the General Secretary!
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live the General Secretary!
Hi!
I just saw it on the Net.
How's your uncle now?
Looks bad, Sarah.
It's happened at such a critical time...
I'm sure he'll get better soon.
Listen, I'm coming to New
York to meet you at the airport.
You don't have to do that.
I want to.
This weekend I want you just to myself... before you get consumed by your presentation!
Love you.
- Come soon.
Miss you.
I want us to discuss each candidate thoroughly.
I have already made the list. Just approve it!
Veerendra, our party follows a democratic process.
Each and every recommendation is discussed.
Will you be kind enough to tell us, which democratic process... was followed to make you the working president?
Uncle... the very president by whose grace... you're adorning that chair... has seen this list.
Then, surely you have his approval in writing.
This list will prevail!
Discuss all you want.
How come you've put your name against Madhopur?
Mr. Bhanu Pratap has always contested from Madhopur.
And in father's absence, the seat is rightfully...
No claim for Madhopur will be entertained.
It is reserved for the party president.
And currently, that is Chandra Pratap.
Only the party president should contest from Madhopur.
Have you even fought a municipal election... that you're staking your claim to Madhopur?!
I will never let your dream come true...
Honourable Working President!
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live Prithvi!
He's here! The leader is here!
He's come to Azad Nagar.
We all welcome him here.
The people of Azad Nagar whole heartedly welcome the leader.
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live Prithvi!
- Long live Prithvi!
Everyone knows that...
30 years ago... our party reclaimed this land from the government and their agents... and established Azad Nagar!
My heart beats for... the poor and the lower castes...
Who is this?
Our driver's son
- Sooraj.
Also a kabaddi champion.
This isn't a dance party.
Tell them to stop.
I want that the candidate for Azad Nagar... should be educated, able and... from amongst you.
Sooraj is our leader!
Sooraj is our leader!
Yeah... okay... okay...
The Rashtrawadi Party candidate for Azad Nagar will be...
Jeevan Kumar!
Jeevan Kumar may belong to our caste... but that doesn't necessarily make him one of us.
He knows nothing about Azad Nagar.
He's never set foot in our dirty lanes... and nor will he, once the elections are over.
Excuse me?
Mr. General Secretary... our candidate will be one of us!
Not an outsider.
This isn't a kabaddi match.
I am speaking of the
Legislative Assembly election.
And the Rashtrawadi candidate will definitely be...
Jeevan Kumar.
- We protest!
- We don't want outsiders!
- We protest!
We don't want outsiders!
Long live Sooraj!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Try to understand.
You're not aware that
Jeevan Kumar's grandfather... was a minister in the Central government.
So?
That makes it his birthright, does it?
What does he know about us?!
Educated abroad... owns mansions... he owns four Mercedes cars of the kind that you chauffeur, dad!
He wouldn't last a day here!
How is he one of us!
Enough is enough!
It's do or die this time.
What is it that you people want?
Whose job is it to select the candidate - yours or the party's?
We'll choose our own candidate!
What?
You'll rebel against the party?
Without the party, you won't garner five votes.
Instead, you'll end up dividing the lower caste votes.
So what do you suggest?
That we continue to suck up... to these politicians... while they plant their leaders on us?
It isn't like that, son.
The party cares for us.
They treat us like equals.
Look, Samar came just for a day... but he got me a new watch.
- A watch? - Yes.
So that you report to work on time.
That's the problem with you guys.
You've barely learnt to walk, but want to fly!
You guys are history!
We generate the power.
Then why should we hand them the switch?
From now on, no outside candidates allowed in Azad Nagar!
- Who Is our leader?
- Sooraj, Sooraj.
- Victory to Sooraj!
- Long live Sooraj!
Do you know me?
You're a big man.
How is a nobody like me supposed to know you, Mr. Babulal?
I like your attitude.
But, these speeches and stunts will get you nowhere.
Even if you win the election as an independent... big deal!
Instead the party will punish Azad Nagar for its defeat.
If you really want to change anything, join the party... and fight as its candidate.
Come on!
Get down.
You know, I'm going to contest the elections this time.
And you'll see, I'll become the youngest woman minister ever.
- Really? - Of course!
And when you come the next time...
I'll come to receive you in a car with a flashing red light.
- Wow!
Such a grand lunch for one measly vote of mine?
For your vote?!
Can't you be a little romantic?
- With you? - No... with this waiter!
Look here, don't ruin my mood.
I want to have a serious chat.
That's very serious.
Stop, stop!
Not just like that.
First propose.
Okay...
Let's drink to your flashing red light.
- Red light? - Yes.
When you become a minister... you will have a car with a flashing red light, won't you?
Samar!
When are we getting married?
Why do you look so shocked?
Marriage...
I...
I didn't quite understand.
You'll understand alright when the priest recites the vows... and I make you take 17 rounds of the sacred fire...
Stop, stop!
Indu...
I know how you feel about me.
But my feelings aren't the same for you, Indu.
I mean, you're an amazing girl.
So beautiful... full of life... honest... just lovely, but...
You can't love me!
Do you know this is the first time you've complimented me?
Beautiful, amazing... full of life...
You can say all this but... you can't utter three words...
I love you.
And here I am... madly in love with you... since childhood.
I'm sorry.
I won't be able to forgive myself.
Have you never loved me?
We're just too different, Indu.
Long live Rashtrawadi!
Long live Rashtrawadi!
I have a simple question for the Working President:
On what basis were the candidates chosen?
Answer this first: On what basis... did you announce your name from the Madhopur seat?
Prithvi Pratap.
Veerendra... you're well aware that the core committee discusses... every candidature before taking any decision.
I want to say something.
You?
What the hell are you doing here?
My name is Sooraj.
I'm from Azad Nagar.
Yeah... yeah... The kabaddi champ!
- But, what Are you doing here?
I want a ticket to contest the election.
Really now!
We're running a charity fete here!
You want a ticket, do you?
Didn't you hear me... when you were busy dancing around?
Our party's candidate for
Azad Nagar is Jeevan Kumar.
Got that?
Get out now!
Security!
I had heard you.
But perhaps, you could neither hear nor see that... the people of Azad Nagar rejected your candidate instantly.
I'm the leader of the lower castes... and they will support only me.
What did you say!
Who made you our leader?
We sweated blood for the party... but suddenly you become the leader, is it?
Everyone knows where... the fruits of your sweat are hidden.
We'll make you account for that too one day!
For now, I only want a ticket to contest from Azad Nagar.
You'll take us to task, will you?
I'll show you.
Son, what are you doing!
Is this the way to speak here?
Please, Sirs... I apologise on his behalf.
- Come... - Father, please...
Keep quiet now. Enough!
- Get him out of here!
- Throw him out!
Take him away.
- He thinks He can contest an election.
Learn to drive instead of dreaming of leadership.
Security!
- Come on.
He isn't going anywhere!
- He stays here. - here? Meaning?
It's clear, Prithviraj.
Sooraj happens to be a member of the core committee.
- No one can throw him out.
- What is this nonsense!
Who made him a member?
I did.
The secretary of the backward and minority cell.
- But, Mr. Veerendra... -
Please read the constitution.
As General Secretary,
I have the right to... nominate three members.
Excuse me.
Come, Sooraj.
Please place a chair for him beside mine.
Please sit.
Respected Mr. Working President... please caution Mr.
Prithviraj that... without the approval of the core committee... he shouldn't go around announcing candidates.
And I propose... that instead of Jeevan Kumar... the party candidate from Azad Nagar... should be Sooraj Kumar.
Adjourned the meeting for now.
The new proposals will have to be included in the agenda.
Hence, this meeting is adjourned until further notice.
Take this.
I'm feeling handicapped without Bhanu.
It's becoming very hard to rein in Veerendra.
He staked his claim to
Madhopur again today.
So? Let him contest.
C'mon, Uncle... You know that Madhopur is reserved...
...for the party president.
If he wins from there, he'll create havoc.
He can even lose.
Are you aware that it is our safest seat?
Even if we nominate a dog from there, it will win.
Brother, if the party can make you win the election... it can also make sure you lose.
Sure. But losing Madhopur isn't good for the party.
Precisely!
If he loses from there, it'll finish his political career.
Moreover, you'll get sympathy for giving up the seat.
That makes sense.
But your problem isn't Veerendra.
It is Sooraj!
He has created a serious situation.
If we give him Azad Nagar, it boosts Veerendra's position.
But, if we don't, we antagonise the lower castes.
I don't know what to do.
We'll talk in one voice.
- Sooraj, Mr. Brij Gopal is here.
Brij Gopal?
How are you all?
Hello.
- Okay, fine.
Sir!
Been a while since I had a cup of your tea.
How nice! Mr. Batukeshwar, you too?
Looks like all the Dalits are here!
Looks like a massive convention.
Since elections are upon us... we need to look at all possibilities.
Of course, of course.
After all, this is the age of the youth.
Please sit...
No matter what, we will never leave the party.
The party is yours anyway.
As far as elections go, you're right.
But, what about after that?
I know that you people are upset about...
...the selection of your candidate.
We have decided... that not just for Azad Nagar, but every lower caste area... we only want local candidates.
That is up to the party.
Now that you're in the core committee... raise this issue there.
For now, the party president has sent me to inform you that... the candidate for Azad
Nagar will be from among you.
God bless you, Mr. Brij Gopal.
As long as you are in the party... there will be no injustice.
Bless you, Sir... for encouraging a poor man's son.
Sooraj will not disappoint you.
Victory to Sooraj!
Victory to Sooraj!
Victory to Sooraj!
Victory to Sooraj!
The party has decided that the candidate from Azad Nagar... will be the party's loyal supporter, and your beloved...
Ram Charittar!
Democracy is alive and well in our party.
Sir, this is a mistake.
The candidate is not me.
It's my son, Sooraj.
Ram Charittar, every father wants his son to move ahead.
But he is still inexperienced.
And is there anyone here who is... more honest and hardworking than you?
Does anyone have an objection, friends?
Tell me, Sooraj... Do you object to your father's candidature?
Why don't you people say something?
Sir... how can I be a candidate?
I'm a mere servant of your family.
Now, you are a servant of the people.
Sir, please...
How can I stand for the election...
I can't do this.
The decision to nominate my father was the right one.
In politics, there are no right or wrong decisions.
Their purpose is merely to achieve a desired result.
Whatever that might be.
I shall remember that.
Let's go.
I'm going to Beesanpur temple... to pray for your nomination.
But, why today?
Because it's your day off.
Father's on a long vacation now.
He will no longer be a chauffeur.
What?!
I have decided.
You're not going to serve that family.
Take the car to Beesanpur.
We'll take the bus, son.
The first list of candidates.
- Hello, sir.
You proposed 55 names. Of those, he cleared only 12!
And, my request for funds?
He refused to clear them.
He will pay for this!
Bad times are here.
We conducted a survey in every district.
78% of the voters... connect with Chandra Pratap.
He is the face of our party.
Chief Minister designate!
Why not?
The party will decide that. Not you!
- Shut up. - No, you be quiet!
This is the party office, not your home.
Respect the decorum of this office.
So, you'll teach me decorum, will you?
Mr. Backward and
Minority Cell Secretary...
The party has decided.
He will be the Chief Minister!
If you have a problem with that...
The public recognises only one face... only one voice... that of Bhanu Pratap.
And you all know who... his rightful successor is.
The party should not fail to recognise that.
Veerendra... your father has himself approved of this decision.
When did father decide this?
This morning.
Every decision of this party is democratic. You know that!
Of course!
I know... who is behind all this.
How only 12 of my 55 candidates are approved.
How all my demands for funds are consistently denied.
Mr. Working President... this decision is not good for the party.
The people will reject it!
Young man, now I call the shots here.
Learn to accept that fact.
Better fall in line or fall by the wayside.
Fall in line?!
Wow, Mr. Working President!
Enough, Veerendra Pratap!
Final warning.
The same constitution that gives you the right... to appoint him a member... also grants me the right... to suspend you from the party.
Sir...
Veerendra is the general secretary of the party.
How can you...
So now, you'll interfere, will you?
I've been watching... the kind of games that some people are playing.
Looks like some players will have to be... rested during this election tournament.
Fall in line!
Now I have to stand in line, eh?
All my life, I doled out alms... now I have to stand in line and beg?!
My father built this party... and he is trying to kick me out of it?
I'll break it!
I will break this party... and form a new one.
Do not make that mistake.
That is what they want.
This party is yours.
They must leave, not you!
How will you throw them out?
How?
See this poster?
This man will become the Chief Minister!
I'll change the poster.
- Mr. Chandra Pratap Is here.
You're off already, son?
Yes, it is okay, father.
Why are you so concerned?
As if you've had any time for him!
You know how things have been...
There's time still.
Put Samar's luggage in my car. - Okay, sir.
- I'll drop him. - You?
Papa, you don't have to do this.
Come.
This time I really didn't get to see you properly.
Everything okay there?
Your PhD?
I'm done with the research.
The presentation is next week.
- Next week? - Yes, papa.
I'm done with my PhD.
Fantastic!
So, now we'll be calling you Dr. Samar Pratap!
Tell me the title of your thesis again. I always seem to forget...
The Sub-textual Emotional Violence of 19th Century Victorian Poetry.
Wonderful!
Sounds so impressive.
What next?
There's an offer to teach.
So you aren't coming back?
Well... I suppose that's fine too.
You'll be the first teacher in our family.
Papa, please... you should go now.
This security thing is too much.
I'll go.
- Let me see you in...
- No papa. Please...
You're blocking the traffic also.
Okay, son.
Come, give me a hug.
God knows when I'll see you again.
These elections...
Father...
Love you, son.
What is it, Babulal?
Mr. Bhanu's condition has suddenly worsened.
We're going to the hospital.
Have the doctor call me.
Okay.
Take me to the hospital!
"My beloved isn"t speaking to me."
"Doors of the heart."
What were you thinking?
I'm not some tragedy queen.
I'll abduct you from across the universe, if that's what it takes.
Really?
New profession?
I can't live without you.
I love you.
Indu, I've to go.
Take care.
Find out what's going on!
- Security, come in.
Get them to move.
Get them to move.
Clear the road...
Another shocking setback to the state's most powerful family.
According to initial reports...
The working president of the Rashtrawadi party...
- Mr. Chandra Pratap...
- was fatally attacked in a shocking incident.
Reports state that this attack... took place on Ratanpur road on the way to the city from the airport.
Mr. Chandra Pratap was in his car when the attack took place.
It seems that he was shot.
As a result of the incident traffic is blocked for miles.
Mr. Brij Gopal for you...
Uncle! How's papa?
They've taken him to the hospital.
I'll pick you up at the airport.
Get the cars!
That will take time,
I'll come by cab...
Just do as I say!
Those who have done this, know that you're at the airport.
You just stay there!
Disconnect the cable TV...
Security on red alert.
My sister shouldn't know of this.
- Okay.
Stop all cars outside the gate!
Let's go.
- Okay, sir.
Where the hell was the security?
What about the police?
It's a single bullet in the throat.
He's very critical.
Has lost a lot of blood.
We're trying to stop it.
Where is the hospital security?
I have no idea, sir.
- Doctor!
- Call the police chief!
You guys, secure this area from all sides.
Get more people.
Move it!
- What happened? -
He's not answering!
Call his deputy then.
Okay, sir.
- Where the hell is papa's security!
Who sent this son of a bitch!
Check their firearm licenses.
Back from the whorehouse, Sharma?
Man the gates!
We don't need cops here.
You heard what I said?
Out!
Let the police do it's job, Mr. Prithviraj... or else...
- Or else?
What will you do?
Why have you come now anyway?
Arrest the bastard!
Drag him away!
Arrest me, will you?
You bloody pimp!
You scoundrel!
Let go! I'll chop you into pieces.
You dare to arrest me, you beggar!
What are you doing?
Now do you remember your duty?
Sir, you can't do this! - B negative blood - we just don't have any!
Come on, arrest me!
- What are you doing?
Come on, arrest me!
Sir, you cannot do this!
Back off!
I can do anything.
Arrest him too!
You will pay for this!!
You hit my brother!
I'll chop you into pieces.
Get up!
- SP Sharma!
Apologise to him.
- You're dead!
I'll kill you.
Sorry.
Hey, you!
Detractors.
Scissors, fast.
Pass the forceps.
Please bring me a glass of water.
Heart rate?
Pass the mop... mop.
Scissors...
Chandu...
I've asked for a CBI inquiry.
The culprit won't get away!
Given these circumstances, I'll have to take charge of the party.
Father...
I need your approval.
Down with police autocracy!
Down with police autocracy!
Free Prithvi!
If the killer isn't caught, we'll burn the city down!
Our people are on the job too.
How is mom?
She's putting up a brave front, but from within she...
SP Sharma himself filed the report.
He's charged you under sections 353, 337 and 307.
But you'll get bail.
I've stated in my report...
Mr. Prithvi had no weapons.
That's my only regret.
- If I had a gun I would've...
- Prithvi!
Uncle.
No one touches SP Sharma.
I'll deal with him myself.
You've made all my dreams come true, friend.
You changed the poster!
I'm screwed, sir.
Now, they believe I was involved even in your uncle's murder.
If he gets bail... he'll kill me.
You didn't charge him appropriately.
You should've used sections 376 and 341.
He would've been in your custody.
Section 376?
- That's a rape charge. - Correct.
So tell me... where should we lodge the rape complaint?
Isn't she...
A totally genuine case, SP.
Prithvi promised to make her a candidate... and for three years he sexually exploited her.
It's a serious charge.
What if she backs out?
Sir...
I've been through hell.
Finally, I'm in safe hands now.
I will get an election ticket here.
There's no question of backing out.
- There seems to be No end to the misery of the Rashtrawadi Party.
In a sensational twist...
Prithviraj, who has already been charged for assaulting...
...a police officer, has now been accused of raping a party worker.
Denied bail, he's been remanded to police custody for 15 days.
I deny every charge levelled against Prithvi.
We shall approach the high court for his bail.
Our supreme leader, Bhanu Pratap is still fighting for his life.
First Chandra Pratap, and now this.
- We Are being attacked repeatedly.
- And on the pretext of investigating, the inept...
...government Is doing nothing.
- But the people demand answers.
- Victory to Rashtrawadi!
- Victory to Veerendra Pratap!
You want me to sign this?
Have you lost it?
- You don't have a choice. - Okay.
Go home and take care of mom.
I can deal with these people.
But that's only if you get out.
Your bail application was denied.
Since it is a rape charge... women's organisations and the media are up in arms.
But, how will signing this help?
Leave that to me, brother.
Trust me.
I'll get you out of here.
They'll pay for this heavily.
Everyone of them!
I've made a big mistake, Sir.
Am appealing to your kindness.
I am younger than you... so deserve forgiveness.
Sorry.
Hey Sharma!
Have you gone mad?
That's my brother, my uncle.
Come, Uncle Brij.
I don't why all this is happening.
Looks like someone cast an evil eye on us.
I'm sorry that you're having to face this.
But don't you worry.
I will take care of everything.
The party... as well as the family.
That's Sooraj... he's like family.
How is Aunt? Please sit.
I'm taking mom to New York.
The right decision. Absolutely!
Don't worry about Prithvi.
I'll move heaven and earth to get him bail.
Without him this election... - My brother won't contest the election.
I'm taking him along too.
He's resigned from the party post.
He won't return from New York.
- You mean... he's never coming back? - Never!
The party is all yours.
Just one condition.
All charges against him should be dropped.
Can be done.
I'll manage the investigation report.
One more thing.
After three days is his court hearing.
Until then, if he... or any member of my family... is hurt in a mishap, of any kind...
I'll call this deal off.
Nothing of that sort will happen.
Martyr's day, indeed!
What a farce!
Master...
Master...
Master...
All this pomp... decorations... huge photographs...
What was the need for all this?
Oh?
Bothering you, is it?
If you wish, we can put up yours too.
Seems the cops didn't look after you well enough.
Brother, please... not now.
Enough of this circus, Samar.
Your boat has capsized.
Time to exit the scene now... for your own good.
What is good for us, and what isn't... will be our decision now, Veeru.
And as soon as you step out... you'll know the public's decision too.
Come on.
Leave.
- Chandra Pratap! - you are immortal...
- Chandra Pratap! - you are immortal...
- Chandra Pratap! - you are immortal...
- Chandra Pratap! - you are immortal...
Orchestrate as many slogans as you wish!
After the funeral... a long and dark exile awaits you!
They aren't going anywhere.
They never intended to.
So Samar...?
Trusting him was a big mistake.
I can't... accept this.
Father, you have to expel Prithvi from the party.
He's a traitor.
He'll destroy the party from within.
Do this for your son.
If I expel Prithvi... it will trigger a... wave of public sympathy... for him.
But father, tolerating him is just impossible for me!
Both father and son treated me like dirt.
I hate that man.
Son... this is politics.
Here, keep your enemies... close to you.
The real enemy isn't Prithvi.
It's Samar!
This was expected.
Bhanu Pratap is a past master of this game.
He knows that accepting the resignation... would've made Prithvi a martyr.
Have you seen this?
Veerendra has organized a mammoth rally in Madhopur.
He'll announce his Chief
Ministerial nomination.
Hello, sir.
The iron is hot.
- Here at the
Rashtrawadi Party's rally, where...
- even as Veerendra
Pratap's helicopter landed...
- on the other side,
Prithvi Pratap, Samar Pratap...
...and Brij Gopal's convoy reached the stage.
- The crowd is confused even as...
- the tableau on the stage becomes more dramatic.
- From the Kothra ground, Madhopur, this Is Malti Joshi, Star News.
Please use the sofas down there.
Today, only family members on the stage.
Please do cooperate...
This is too much. I'll show them their status today.
Brother Veeru, don't act in haste.
But Sooraj, they...
You know you can end their political career.
You come this way. Come on.
What's the meaning of this outrage, Uncle?
In politics, it's called hijack in broad daylight.
What do you mean?
- Take care of yourselves.
Long live Prithvi Pratap!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
My name is...
Samar Pratap.
I'm the youngest... and I humbly greet you all.
You've resigned from the party, Prithvi!
How will you fight now?
Throw it in the dustbin, Veerendra.
If you have the guts, throw me out in front of them.
- Your wish will come true, Prithvi.
I've always been kept away from politics... and nor am I here to talk politics today.
I only want to know one thing:
My father, Chandra Pratap gave his life for you... at his elder brother's command.
Does that martyrdom hold any value for you? Or not?
I only want to know one thing:
While his father lay dying... the police falsely accused Prithvi and physically dragged him away.
Does his struggle mean nothing to you?
- Prithvi, please fight on... We are with you!
There is no court higher than the people's court.
And the people of Madhopur... have always done justice!
This is the hour of destiny, friends!
In these trying times...
Rashtrawadi party needs a strong and able leader.
Someone who cares about the poor... who fights for their dignity... and who will not hesitate to sacrifice his life for them!
And you know very well who that is.
And to strengthen his resolve... we have with us... our brother, Veerendra Pratap...
Dalit leader, Sooraj Kumar... and our beloved, Brij Gopal.
Elders, brothers, sisters, friends... that leader is your very own...
Prithvi Pratap!
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
Long live Rashtrawadi Party!
To preserve... the integrity of the party...
I am pained to declare... that Prithvi Pratap... is hereby... dismissed... from the Rashtrawadi Party.
Sir, please... answer to our question.
It went exactly the way you had planned.
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
By dismissing me from my own party, they believe that...
I have become homeless and orphaned.
They're under a huge illusion.
Even if they expel me from the party... how can they remove me from your hearts!
My home is in your hearts... and I'm not leaving that!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
It was as if the entire town had turned up for my meeting!
The people are with us.
The caste-wise combination of every constituency... the local issues... the candidates' election history... it's all here.
The list of the top three candidates from every constituency.
Samar, we have only nine days... to file nominations... and our party doesn't even have a name yet.
I know, brother.
Remember, you had formed an organisation in college?
Prabhu.
- Right away.
That's the name of your party.
You're a youth symbol... and that will be your appeal.
We respect you a lot.
But you are well aware that our community has always suffered.
I know that, Arif.
But times have changed.
You can definitely trust us.
We do trust you, Brij sir but... you know that these political issues are very delicate.
We won't change our loyalty.
I can understand.
We shall pray for you.
- Thank you.
Uncle their support is crucial.
33% of the voters in the 132 constituencies are Muslims.
They vote in a group and we can't bribe their vote.
Well then... we'll need to strengthen our position.
And as that happens, the
Muslims will support us.
Uncle, we also need to gain the support of...
...the small regional parties.
Talks are underway, but they are asking for a huge price.
Take it.
Here is the confirmation.
What's this?
We have removed
Prithvi's name from... every single bank account of the party.
Great! Let him thrash about for every penny.
Babulal, the businessmen?
I've instructed all of them.
Let him fight the election as a beggar!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
Long live!
- Prithvi!
We need a crowd of 300,000.
You're asking for thousands, but offering peanuts for that.
I'll... make sure you get the balance.
My dear sir, to organise crowds, one needs advance cash. Not credit.
Don't waste my time.
I'll... get it done.
You've always supported us.
We've already given to the party fund.
That party doesn't exist.
I'm talking about Prithvi Pratap.
After all, he will be your next Chief Minister.
May your words come true!
We're always there for you.
But times are tough.
Now, that you've come personally... please accept this offering.
Looks like a couple of zeros have been missed out.
I brought receipts for 50 million... while you are offering half a million.
I respect your status.
Hence, I can't accept this.
I'm leaving the receipts here, though.
Thank you.
- Looks like, we've suddenly become political outcasts.
I've spoken with Sakseria.
I'm going to see him.
I don't think in these conditions he'll bet on Prithvi.
- Your father had done a lot for him. Let's see.
- I'll visit your father today itself.
Don't hesitate to call for absolutely anything.
For now, only what I've asked for.
- Of course! 500 million will reach you by this evening.
Don't worry.
- I shall leave now.
Mr. Brij Gopal!
- Hello.
Please, come in.
- No... just came to say hello.
How is Indu?
She's well... very well.
Okay then...
Why're you being so difficult,
Sarah? - Am I being difficult?!
You were supposed to return three weeks ago and...
My father was shot dead! Remember?
Don't talk to me like that, Samar.
Look, I'm sorry. It's just that it's been...
I check my phone 50 times a day seeing if you've called.
You never have. The only news I get is off the Net.
Listen, I can't talk right now.
I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?
- I'm coming there,
Samar. - No, you're not!
Sarah, please listen, listen to me.
The time is not right. And I've some serious priorities out here.
And obviously I don't figure in them.
- Thanks, Samar
Fuck!
Mr. Samar is in the office.
Should I inform him?
I'm here to meet Aunty.
Why don't you get married to Samar?
Then you can be with me, always.
I don't need to marry anyone for that.
Samar, have you fought with Indu?
It's nothing. I'm fine.
May I say something?
What?
I've been a fool, Indu.
What are you trying to say?
Just this... that not only does my mother, but even I like you.
You're lying!
No!
I didn't know then.
I was confused.
I'm sorry.
Mom, I accept.
Please speak with her dad.
See... if this is a joke, I'll hammer you.
Look at that!
Threats of violence, already?
Mom, do ask for an ambulance as dowry.
Who knows when I'll have to go to the hospital.
"The love is raining.
The color is all over."
"The anklet is colored, the drape is colored.
I am colored in your love."
"My heart is swaying."
"It keeps swinging."
"Come to me beloved. I don"t feel good without you."
"The love is raining."
"The color is all over."
Phenomenal response to Prithvi!
His media management is excellent, fantastic.
Your younger son, Samar... is a gem.
I'm here to ask something for him.
Anything... anything, of course!
Thank you.
I'm very fond of Indu.
And I'm sure, she'll keep Samar happy.
I've been looking forward to this day.
And you know what...
Samar will make an excellent Chief Minister.
No, it is Prithvi who'll be the CM.
Samar is just helping him.
That's fine too.
After all, Prithvi is the leader.
Then, we should let Samar be.
Let Indu marry Prithvi.
How can you say that!
That's impossible.
Moreover, Indu loves Samar.
You don't worry about Indu.
My choice will be her choice.
See, if I am to finance a party, then obviously I will insist... that my daughter should marry the CM designate.
And in either case, she will come to your family.
Let's go.
Have you gone mad?
Stop talking nonsense.
How can you even imagine that I'll marry Indu!
Samar is right, Prithvi.
We don't have a choice.
Of course we do!
I've decided.
Samar will become the CM.
So what if I don't get to sit on that chair?
My brother will!
Ridiculous.
- Wait a minute.
You think only you can make sacrifices?
And I can't?
I don't care for a position that takes your happiness away.
Brother... my happiness lies only in making you the CM.
And, you want to know the truth?
Indu knows that I don't love her.
Then why did you send the proposal?
Because of you.
Only Sakseria can fund your election.
To hell with his money!
You're my younger brother.
- We'll do it on our own. -
That is no longer an option.
If we don't accept his support, he'll offer it to Veerendra.
And marry Indu to him.
Indu is a very nice girl.
She'll learn to love you.
And I know that... you will look after her well.
How can you do this!
Am I only a business proposal for you?
Just another source of income.
You're upset now.
We'll talk about this later.
Our list...
- Why are you doing this to me?
Why?
Come... let's go to the other room.
Let me handle this, brother.
You say you don't love me... fine!
Don't want to marry me... don't!
But what right do you have to meddle in my life?
You're forgetting that it was I who asked for your hand in marriage.
So what if my father spoke nonsense?
I still love you!
I have forsaken his house... his wealth...
I'll go with you wherever you take me.
I can't marry anyone else.
I can't live without you.
In these circumstances I can't marry you.
Please, Samar... Don't say that!
Take back your decision.
I can't take a chance with my brother's political career.
And my life?
You have no problem destroying it!
I am not destroying your life, Indu.
I'm trying to protect it.
You know that if we reject Prithvi's proposal... your father will marry you off to Veerendra.
Please try to understand, Indu.
Whatever you may think of Prithvi...
I know he will love you a lot.
And then mom's here too.
You will be very happy here.
This is how it's always been, child.
We are the ones who're always expected to compromise.
Hello. Hello.
We are indeed honoured by your presence.
Come, sir...
Hello.
- Hello. - God bless you.
Mr. Sakseria, the super
Chief Minister is here.
Please do introduce me.
- Hello.
My father has sent this... for the bride.
Thanks for coming.
Do you seriously believe... that by selling your brother you can win the election?
Looks like you're nervous.
Let Sakseria stake as much loot as he wants... you brother will still fall flat.
The fear of defeat is clearly visible on your face.
Uncle, please look after him.
Enjoy the evening.
Overconfident, eh?
Mr. Sooraj, an exclusive byte, please.
What can I say about myself?
Speak to the people.
Some personal questions, please.
You must be joking.
There's nothing worth hiding in a poor person's life.
My life is an open book.
However, I can point you in an interesting direction.
What do you mean?
Thank you, sir.
Hello. Please be seated.
Sir, how's your campaign doing?
Fantastic!
In just 7 days, we've confirmed 200 plus candidates.
And it's obvious that the people are with us.
It seems that your entire campaign is funded by Rajkumar Sakseria.
See, ours in a new party.
Whoever has wanted to help...
How much dowry did you collect from him?
Look here... let's stick to election-related questions.
Well, this question is on everyone's lips.
Even though Indu was openly seeing your brother... how come she got married to you?
This is my personal and family matter.
Then, at least tell us... about the compromises you've made in this marriage.
Are you absolutely sure that... while you are busy campaigning... your wife isn't with your brother?
Hey! Shut up!
Shut up!
- What's the meaning of this?
Stop this. Stop this at once!
- What are you doing?
You asked... a very filthy question.
You will pay for this! Shut this.
Stop it! Hello.
- Shut this down!
- Prithvi Pratap had already been charged with...
- assaulting a police officer
And of raping a woman party worker.
- Shut this! Shut this down!
Sir... one more thing, please.
Mr. Sooraj... what do you have to say about Mr.
Prithvi Pratap's recent outburst?
My sympathies are with him.
His marriage itself was a huge compromise.
Hence, it isn't surprising for him to lose his mental balance.
And it's obvious that he can't cope with the stress of elections.
He needs to rest.
This for Samar.
- I... I'll take this.
Guess who this is!
- Who?
This must be Samar's mom, right?
Absolutely.
This is Samar's friend, Sarah.
- Oh?
Namaste!
- Oh... yes, namaste.
And, this is Samar's sister-in-law,
Indu. - Hi.
You didn't tell me she was coming!
How could I - she called me at 3 A.M. From the airport.
Sarah?
Look Sarah... life here is different.
I won't be able to explain everything.
You'll just have to trust me.
Do you still love me, Samar?
What kind of a question is that?
Do you love me?
Of course I love you.
Very much.
You don't have to worry about me.
I trust you completely.
The two of you look very nice together.
She obviously loves you a lot.
But maybe she doesn't know... that you can't love anyone.
Indu, please listen to me...
- No, you listen to me!
You only know how to use people.
I don't even recognise this Samar.
The darkness that I see in your heart!
I'm actually grateful to my father... for rejecting your proposal.
Because whatever your brother may be... he has a pure heart.
You won't understand this, Indu.
This much I do understand, Samar.
That we don't exploit those...
...who love us.
Sarah may not be able to bear it.
The election campaign of the
Rashtravadi party has gone up.
The campaigning was at its full flow at the district Beerpur.
There were huge rallies in several areas. The new...
...president of the party Virendra
Pratap and the general secretary...
...Suraj Kumar delivered speech too. If the presence of
...the voters is taken into consideration than this campaign...
...has been thriving. Media has already made Suraj Kumar...
...a hero of the backward class.
The pace with which he has...
...evolved in politics and with his gift of gab he has already become...
...a leader amongst the backward class and would be supported by them.
There is no cause for worry here.
Every single person is rooting for you.
On the one hand, you speak of our old alliance... and yet, you are being secretive about seat-sharing.
What am I supposed to tell the High Command?
Bhanu, I'll have to declare the seats today.
If you enjoy defeat, you can have more seats.
Veerendra... don't forget that mine is a national party.
Don't force me to take drastic decisions.
Give me a break, grandpa!
Don't forget that we've been lugging your national burden.
The last time you had just 12 legislators... and yet we made you the Chief Minister.
So, this time don't expect even six.
Now you decide.
Veeru... make that 10.
We'll lose all of them.
We can't take that chance.
Bhanu... the coalition will break.
Ask him to release 20 seats.
We'll pay you a total of...
400 million.
- Victory to Rashtrawadi!
- Victory to Rashtrawadi!
Sir, what are the terms of alliance with Prajatantrik Party?
Sir, who else is filing nominations along with you?
How many seats are they contesting?
You will get to know it all very soon.
Patience... Patience is always rewarded.
Everything is going in their favour.
If you don't do something quick, we'll lose the plot.
Samar sir, we need a masterstroke.
Yes, sir?
I had asked you for a favour, Babulal.
Your favour is not so easy to fulfill, sir.
And it wouldn't be very ethical of me, would it?
True. Sorry, I disturbed you.
He wasted my time.
He is speaking of ethics. Imagine!
Now, what are the ethics of a bandit? Tell me.
Hello... hello?
Babulal, yesterday you were giving me a lecture on ethics...
I was... I was... I was completely out of line, sir...
I could see that.
Anyway, tell me where I should send these photos.
Please forgive me, sir...
I...
I... very...
I went astray...
Please forgive me...
I... can...
I beg of you... Please forgive me.
Brother Samar... the time is really bad.
The man needs some help.
What's this?
I was... helpless...
You already know this to be true.
Now, you only have to state it publicly.
But... but...
Never be afraid of the truth!
I'm with you. Have no fear.
No harm will come to you. Come.
Don't you trust me?
This way.
Okay ready. Silence, please.
Allegations and counter-allegations during elections are...
...a common occurrence.
But, what we're about to reveal now will stun you.
Today we have with us... a staunch loyalist of Rashtrawadi...
Mr. Babulal.
Having served the party faithfully for 25 years... it pains me to admit that... the Rashtrawadi Party has become a den of corruption.
When Mr. Bhanu
Pratap was in power... his son...
Veerendra Pratap took... fixed kickbacks from every government contract.
He raked in billions.
Even donations meant for the party fund... were not spared.
Ever since Sooraj Kumar became general secretary... this politics of cash... has escalated.
- In these elections...
- Get him here!
Son of a bitch!
The men are on their way.
I'm going to torture the bastard to death!
Veeru, please calm down.
This is Samar's ploy.
It's imperative that Babulal publicly take back his own statement.
Don't worry at all, Babulal.
Have a seat.
Your safety is my responsibility now.
Tell me...
That night when you called my father at the airport...
...who asked you to make that call?
Wh... what are you asking?
I... don't understand...
Who asked you to call?
Phone?
I... I didn't call.
Babulal... you are one of us.
I respect you a lot.
Please... don't insult me.
S... s... sssir... I beg of you...
Don't ask me this question.
Who asked you to call my father?
Veerendra Pratap... or Sooraj?
Sooraj Kumar.
Thank you.
You have proved your loyalty.
You're definitely one of us.
You... mine...
I just need your benediction.
Of course.
You have my word.
Here... your phone.
I've entered my personal number into it.
I'll always be in touch.
Anytime.
Anytime.
Sooraj.
It was Sooraj.
Anytime...
Love you so much...
Who's been coaching you?
Uncle Brij.
Mr. Babulal's violent death has sent shock waves...
...throughout the state's political circles.
What is being seen as more than a mere coincidence is that... just this morning he resigned from Rashtrawadi Party... publicly levelling allegations of corruption...
...and nepotism against the party leadership.
Mr. Babulal was killed in a car blast on the Chhattarpur road...
...while he was travelling.
Both he and his driver died of severe burn injuries on the spot.
Oh my God! That's him!
That's the man I saw in your office this morning.
The cause of the blast is yet to be determined.
However, initial evidence suggests...
...it could have been a bomb placed in the car.
Yes, that's him.
Babulal.
He is dead, Samar!
Hmmm... tragic.
Must've been involved in something messy.
- While the investigation Is still on...
- they Are not going to rule out any possibilities.
Got to get some work done.
Bye.
Mr. Veerendra Pratap... after Babulal's testimony on TV, didn't you threaten him? - Rubbish!
- He was a victim of a deadly conspiracy. - Who was behind this?
- He openly accused you of corruption. So, did you?
Meaning?
What the hell do you mean?
That I got him killed?!
He was like my family.
One of the founders of this party.
Babulal's murder... will cost them dearly.
Very dearly.
They're scared... panic stricken!
Their singular objective is to destroy our unity.
But, brothers...
Rashtrawadi's foundations aren't so weak... as to be shaken by such incidents.
Baseless allegations... imaginary scandals.
They're scrambling around for dirt to throw at us!
But, let them know, that if you spit at the sky... it will land back on your own face.
The repercussions will be severe.
The repercussions will be severe!
Inspector Sharma!
Your vacation's over.
Do something useful now.
Do something.
We're petitioning the court to... reopen the rape investigation against Prithvi.
Mark my words, he will be behind bars.
We're also asking the
Election Commission to... disqualify him since he is a criminal.
That's fine, Veeru.
But, for the election we only need people's support.
Which we are assured of anyway.
- Why not let sleeping dogs lie? - Sooraj!
In politics, you never let dogs sleep.
You keep them awake.
So that when needed... they bark!
Make me talk to Prithvi.
It's urgent.
It's Inspector Bhola Singh.
Says it's urgent.
Hello?
- Hello, sir.
The prey is here. In the farm house of Mr. Veerendra.
Security is very tight.
- Okay.
Tell me what do I do?
Get your men out of there. I'm on my way.
Head to Chhattarpur farms.
Come on. Get going from here.
Party president Prithvi Singh did a road show in Madhavpur.
There was a great amount of enthusiasm in people for this.
Men, women, children and even senior citizens participated in it.
First a rally at Ramna Maidan and now a road show at Madhavpur.
With this new and youthful image of Prithvi Singh...
...he is slowly gaining popularity amongst young voters.
When you play hide-n-seek with me, it creates magic in my heart...
Hey, Sharma! Where were you hiding, huh?
That was one long vacation!
I really missed you.
I... made a big mistake, sir.
Your slap packs a solid punch, pal.
It does!
Why don't you give me a sample?
It was a big mistake.
I did apologize... to Brij Gopal.
So? Lovely, wasn't it?
You did absolutely right.
I deserved it!
But, now I'll be good.
See, I'm the one who made that woman... withdraw her complaint against you.
Ah, that woman...
Glad that you reminded me of her.
I've to settle her account too.
I... I'll bring her to you, whenever you want.
Good. Call her now.
Mr. Sharma! What's up?
I'm here with the boss.
He wants to meet you.
- Where Are you? - been shopping at the new market.
Huh? New market?
Call Nathu and Ballu.
They should be there.
- Wait right there.
I'm sen... sending a car.
- Vee... Veerendra's called you urgently.
Yeah, sure.
Ah, I just love this one!
- This silk is from Benaras.
Made by hand...
- all hand-crafted.
Hey... hey... Let go! Let go of me.
Come on, sit in the car.
- Let go off me!
Come on, sit inside. Don't shout!
- Let go off me!
Let go off me!
Help! Help!
Please, help me!
- Tell me... - Sir, our men Are here.
Who all?
I recognized Ballu.
He moves with Prithvi.
Let go! To the new market.
Help me! Help!
Hey! Hey! Leave her!
Somebody help her!
What's everybody doing?
Call the police!
Yes, Samar...
Have you gone crazy, brother?
Now that everything's going well, don't do anything stupid.
It's done.
Finished!
You should've seen his face.
Brother, please listen to me.
Leave me... leave me!
Just a sec...
I've another favour to return.
I'll call you later.
Please get out of there, fast!
I'm sending some guys to clean up.
Let me go...
Hey...
Please, let me go.
How are you, sweetheart?
Now, tell me... Where do you want to contest from? Huh?
From Sitapur?
Or from hell?
Somebody call the police!
Sarah... please...
Sir, listen to us...
Ma'am, one minute please.
Ma'am, did you see the kidnaper?
Move back! Move back all of you.
We have freedom of the press.
She will have to talk.
The media is free.
But remember...
...your freedom cannot be used to terrorise us.
What happened, love?
I've seen that man!
Who?
- The man!
The man who kidnapped that woman.
I've seen him around here somewhere.
You're in shock, Sarah.
You need some rest.
The police will look into it.
Come on.
- Sir, this is Inspector Singh. SP
Sharma was killed around 4 PM.
- We've found drugs on his body.
- Clean It up. - Okay.
- I'll inform Veeru about this.
No!
Don't bother. I'll tell him myself.
Okay.
Jeez, Sarah...
You gave me a start!
What's up, Sarah?
That's what I've come to find out, Samar.
What's happened to you!
What d'you mean?
You've changed, Samar.
Or maybe not.
Maybe you were always like this... and, it's just that I didn't see it.
What are you talking about, Sarah?
I'm talking about what you do here, in the name of family and politics!
Oh, come on!
You can't believe what the media has to say.
At least don't insult me by lying to me, Samar.
Those goons who kidnapped that woman... those were your brother's men.
You knew that!
And you killed Babulal!
Stay out of this, Sarah.
This is politics.
Right!
You have become a ruthless, conniving politician!
Fuck!
If this is what you believe... then I have nothing more to say to you.
You don't have to dismiss me, Samar.
I was coming to tell you that I'm leaving.
Sarah...
I've seen enough politics and violence, Samar.
You seem to forget that I grew up in Ireland.
I saw my father and my brother killed... when I was six years old.
My child is not going to face that.
Ever!
Child?
- Wait a minute. Are you saying... - Yes...
I'm pregnant!
Wow sweetheart, that's terrific! I...
Please don't! Don't... please.
I'm leaving.
I'll come with you!
I'll come away from all of this.
Sarah, listen to me...
I swear on our child.
Just give me a few weeks.
I need to finish this election, Sarah.
They killed my father.
I must protect my brother now.
Everything will be okay.
You'll see.
I'll come to you very soon, okay?
Sensational news!
It is unprecedented in the country's election history... that so many nominations of one party have been rejected altogether.
The Election Commission has said that the nominations...
...were incorrectly filed.
The papers were correctly filed, Veeru.
Yes, everything was in order.
In order, my foot!
Instead of originals, photocopies were submitted.
Even the affidavits didn't have your signatures.
We lost 17 seats without even contesting.
Whose side are you on?
I know whose side they're on.
And who is behind this.
Why did you do this?
Why?
Hang us if you wish, Veeru...
We were compelled.
You don't even deserve to be hanged.
Veeru...
Shut up!
You leave. Leave.
They were 23, now only 17 left, how?
Six of Sooraj's men backed out.
Exit poll result for the first round.
Of 73 seats, they're predicting 45-47 for us.
That's nonsense!
Out of 73, we shall take 52.
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
- Victory to Jan Shakti!
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
- Victory to Jan Shakti!
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
I'm sorry.
I failed to understand you.
I love you.
Even I love you very much.
Just didn't know how to show it.
You! You're the one I'll vote for.
For 25 years, I voted for Rashtrawadi party.
But this time, I will vote for you!
No one can defeat you.
Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
- Samar Pratap seems to have boosted...
- his brother Prithvi
Pratap's campaign tremendously.
- In villages, towns, big cities, in every corner of the state...
The Election Commission rejected our petition against Prithvi.
- It's waiting for the court's decision.
On the other hand, Prithvi Pratap...
What the hell is going on here!
First Babulal... then Sharma... the nominations conspiracy!
That little brat... is now dictating our future?!
And you, Sooraj?
You can't do anything.
It will work out.
- Like hell it will!
Just keep consoling me... since you can't offer me any confidence!
Veerendra Pratap doesn't need... anyone's support.
Indu...
I know what you've been through but...
I hope you can forgive Samar.
It's okay, Sarah.
I've found my happiness.
Prithvi is a wonderful person.
Daya?
- Yes, sir? - Where are you off to?
To the restroom, sir.
They've to leave for the airport. Hurry up.
Samar!
Samar!
Wait!
Don't go near the car. Step back!
Sarah, stop!
Take care of mother.
My beloved doesn't talk to me...
My beloved doesn't talk to me...
He doesn't let me...
He doesn't let me into his heart...
My beloved doesn't talk to me...
The fever isn't subsiding at all.
He is still passed out.
Nothing seems to be going right.
Everything will fall apart.
- Sir? - Where Is Sooraj?
What is the matter?
- Where Is Sooraj? - He Is sleeping.
He has a fever.
Should I wake him up?
No.
You won't be able to see this.
It's better that you stay here.
Sir... please say something.
What are you doing, sir!
The family that fed you... supported you... gave you a life.
He wants to destroy that same family?
Sooraj would never do that.
- He is doing it!
You gave birth to a snake.
That can't be!
If he were my own blood,
I would have believed it.
But he is a blessing from
God. Everyone worships him.
What did you just say?
- We were childless.
It was 27 years ago that...
I found him in a boat at sunrise...
...near the
Sukhamaniya ghats at Benaras.
He was wrapped in this cloth... and had this jewellery.
No one knows about this.
Sooraj himself doesn't know.
How can Sooraj do this to me when you are around?
- I can't do anything to him. - Why not?
Because he is... your son.
What?
Your first born... who I snatched from your womb, 27 years ago.
From here on, you'll have to walk alone, sister.
Please tell me... what I can do for you.
An unfortunate mother has come to ask forgiveness from her son.
Your son?
Who is your son here?
You, Sooraj.
You are my son.
Listen...
I understand you're in shock...
I am sorry for your loss.
No, Sooraj... it is true!
Ram Charittar isn't your father.
27 years ago... he found you... at the riverside in Benaras.
What kind of a joke is this!
Son, I gave birth to you.
You are my first born.
The elder brother of
Prithvi and Samar.
You are lying!
You want to protect your son.
Your father was Bhaskar Sanyal.
I worshipped him.
One day, we got carried away... in a storm of emotions.
He blamed himself... and forsook everything.
I was an unmarried girl.
Please forgive me, son.
I was bound by the limitations of my family's honour.
So, why're you telling me this now?
Come home, son.
That is where you belong.
Samar will happily accept you.
The party will also get a boost.
Moreover, you are the eldest.
You should be the leader.
Beg your pardon?
Leader?! Wow!
In one breath you make me your son.
And in the next, you play politics with me!
- No, Sooraj... I was... - do you really believe... that by dangling the promise of power you can twist my integrity?
You may have given birth to me... but I am the son of Ram
Charittar Kumar and Shanti Devi.
My soul is that of a Dalit.
Mrs. Bharati Pratap...
I won't make the same mistake you did.
When I was down and out...
Veerendra Pratap supported me.
Gave me respect... and an identity.
Only he has a right to my loyalty.
Until my last breath
I will stand by him.
Don't you trust me, father?
I will never let the
Rashtrawadi Party go down.
The final victory will be ours.
God, it appears, is testing us severely.
But you will not break.
Please Indu... you will have to be strong.
You will have to be strong.
Everything is over.
- It's over.
- We Are orphaned.
Samar...
- now you Are our only hope.
It is true that... we have suffered a very tragic blow.
But don't forget that... the resolve that our leader Prithvi had undertaken... is alive even today.
Brothers... nothing is over... and nor are we orphans.
Come on.
This is Mrs. Indu Prithvi Pratap.
Jan Shakti party's new leader.
Under her leadership, we'll contest the elections... and be victorious!
I, Brij Gopal... as the mentor of the
Jan Shakti Party... nominate Mrs. Indu Prithvi Pratap... as Jan Shakti Party's new president.
We support this nomination.
- You have our support!
- I... - I, Indu Prithvi Pratap... take this vow, in the presence of God... take this vow, in the presence of God...
I will be a member of the
Jan Shakti Party for life...
I will be a member of the
Jan Shakti Party for life... and follow every rule... and follow every rule... and command of the party.
And command of the party.
- Long live Jan Shakti!
- Long live Jan Shakti!
- Long live India!
- Long live India!
- Victory to Indu Pratap!
- Victory to Indu Pratap!
My tears haven't dried up yet.
And I won't allow them to dry up.
Until I get an answer from you!
Tell me... how can you tolerate... these unending attacks on me?
My father-in-law was brutally murdered.
But, you remained silent.
His own son was humiliated... and driven out of his party.
But, you remained silent.
The henna applied on my hands for my wedding hadn't even faded... and they mercilessly made me a widow.
But, even now, you remain silent!
Why?
Answer me!
Are you going to vote my family's killers... into power?
No!
Is this your sense of justice?
- No!
Does my sacrifice count for nothing?
- It does! It does!
Answer me!
- It does! It does!
All initial reports seem to point towards a majority for Indu Pratap.
After the history of conflict with the Rashtrawadi Party... violence was anticipated but... barring one or two incidents, elections were peaceful.
There were a few complaints against the EVMs.
From Bada Bazaar, in Balrampur... with cameraman Ram Narayan, this is Mukta Tiwari for Star News.
Muslims, Hindus, all... seem to be in one line.
It's entirely a one-sided contest.
The widow is going to sweep it all away.
Hello, sir.
- Hello.
How're things?
- Here we had no problems but... reports from other areas aren't too encouraging.
- Most exit polls predict 120-130 seats...
- for the Jan Shakti party led by Indu Pratap.
- Victory to Indu Pratap!
Long live Indu Pratap!
- If the result goes this way then...
- in the 207-member legislative assembly...
- Jan Shakti will hold a clear majority.
- The party workers of Jan
Shakti Are already celebrating.
- On the other side, the Rashtrawadi party office Is a picture of gloom.
What is the report?
- There seem to have been some stray complaints...
- about the malfunctioning of Electronic Voting Machines.
The machine in our booth just wasn't working.
No matter which button we pressed, the vote registered elsewhere.
- From three other places, similar complaints were...
He has rigged the machines.
I am dead sure!
- Where Is the boss?
He's been up all night watching TV reports.
It's urgent.
So, Raghav, tell me... are the voting machines actually tampered with?
- I'll just put him on.
Sir... it's Moti.
Some suspicious activity at Bankepur.
- Tell me... - Sir...
Samar and his men are here since last night... with computers, antennae and other stuff.
I heard they're tampering with the voting machines by remote.
What the...?
Keep an eye on them.
- I'm on my way. - Okay.
Follow me to the Bankepur area.
Come on, hurry up.
- Hurry up!
Where did he go?
I have no idea. He just drove off.
What do you mean?
Where was the security?
- He must've said something.
- Nothing at all.
He isn't answering his phone.
- Yes, Sooraj. - Veeru...
Where Are you?
Near the defunct
Bankepur cable factory.
I'm on my way. Don't get out of the car.
By then that Samar would've changed all the bloody votes.
Come on... that's impossible!
What is impossible now is to trust anyone, Sooraj.
Using some fancy hi-tech tricks, he is... snatching our votes from under our noses... and you say...
Just don't get out of the car! I'm on my way.
He's here.
Alone.
Nobody shoots.
His car is bullet-proof.
Sooraj Kumar is here too, sir.
Don't shoot.
- Yes? - Veeru... nothing happening here.
It's better we leave.
Didn't you notice outside?
I didn't see anyone outside.
They're talking on the phone.
We can't wait for long.
They are hiding somewhere.
I'll take a look.
- No! Don't step out.
I'll have a look.
No one shoots... until Veeru steps out.
Shoot, Sooraj!
Shoot him, Sooraj!
Shoot him, Sooraj!
- Veeru... Veeru... - Huh?
Don't close your eyes!
Shoot! Shoot!
Veeru...
Let's finish this war right here, Samar.
Just... allow me to take
Veeru to the hospital.
Then I'll come wherever you want me to.
My life is in your hands.
I am bound by my commitment to... protect my friend.
Come on, Veeru...
What are you waiting for, Samar?
He is unarmed.
So?
Did they kill your father and brother on the battlefield?
Don't get trapped in questions of justice and ethics.
This is the time!
Don't lose sight of the goal for which you entered this fight.
Remember, in politics... victory is all that matters.
And, your victory will remain incomplete... as long as he is alive.
Come on.
Finish him!
Sooraj!
I...
I, Indu Pratap... swear in the name of God... that I will uphold... the Indian constitution... with dedication, honesty and respect.
I shall always seek to preserve the unity and diversity of India.
As the Chief
Minister of the state...
I promise to perform my duties with dedication... and a clear conscience.
I never wanted to do... any of the things that I did.
You, of all people, know this, uncle.
Please forgive me.
I am sorry, Indu.
I am sorry that I hurt you so much.
I know that you may never be able to forgive me.
Do you really have to go?
I always wanted to stay away from politics.
I feared the demons... that it brings out.
But, that is exactly what happened.
I couldn't escape my circumstances... and ended up losing everything.
But, I know...
I know that you're not like that.
Your heart is pure.
You'll be okay.
My world was very different, Indu... in which I only had Sarah.
Now, I must look after her mother.
But, you'll have to return soon.
There's something of your brother with me.
I am going to be the mother of his child.
Wow, Indu!
Wow... I mean that's...
It's been a long while since this family received some good news.
Congratulations!
Come back soon.
Of course, I will.
But on one condition.
You have to come to receive me in a car with the flashing red light.
Bye.
Sir, you?
Ram Charittar is part of the family.
Where can he go?
I am the one who has always driven you to and from the airport.
As a child, you played in my lap...
Please, forgive me.
No, uncle.

This is the story of a film
that was never completed.
A film designed to serve
as propaganda for the Third Reich,
that empire infatuated with a camera...
that knew so well
to document its own evil...
passionately, systematically...
like no other nation before it.
A full decade after the end of the war,
East German archivists
began for the first time...
to sort through what remained
of Hitler's propaganda machine.
Thousands of films discovered in the exact
location in which they had been stashed.
A concrete vault hidden in a forest.
It is also there that one lone copy
of a film was found.
Over one hour long, with no soundtrack,
no opening or closing credits.
Only a brief title:
The Ghetto.
It was a rough first draft...
of the longest Nazi propaganda film
ever shot inside the Warsaw Ghetto,
the largest of the Jewish ghettos
established by the Nazis in occupied Roland.
The silent footage juxtaposes
meticulously staged scenes...
in which Jews are shown
enjoying a life of luxury in the Ghetto...
with images that required
no staging at all.
Why was the film crew
sent to film the Ghetto...
shortly before it would be wiped out?
And why was work on the film
cut short in the early stages of editing?
In the absence of
a final version of the film,
the intention of the propagandists
can never be determined.
One can only surmise.
Ironically, after the war,
this film commissioned by the Nazis...
turned into a trustworthy document
for any filmmaker or museum...
seeking to show what really happened...
to tell the untellable.
The cinematic deception was forgotten,
and the black-and-white images were
engraved in memory as historical truth.
From the frenzy of propaganda,
the images alone remain,
concealing many layers of reality.
May 1942.
The Warsaw Ghetto.
Two and a half years have passed
since the Ghetto was established.
And in three months, many of those
we see here will be sent to their death.
Here are images in which these people
are still fighting for their lives.
What the film doesn't tell is that nearly
half a million Jews were trapped here...
in a walled-in area
of less than three square miles,
in conditions
of unparalleled overcrowding,
plagued by hunger and typhus.
The Ghetto housed not only
the many Jews of Warsaw,
but also thousands of Jewish refugees...
deported from all corners of the Reich,
with no possessions, no language,
no chance to survive.
Those who were caught smuggling
food or attempting to escape...
were immediately captured and shot.
And, as in every other ghetto, here, too,
the Nazis had set up a Judenrat...
a Jewish council...
appointing as its head Adam Czerniakow,
whose job was to manage
for them from inside...
what had essentially become the holding
pen before the final destination.
As he fought a losing battle
to save all he possibly could,
Czerniakow insisted on documenting
the events of his life...
day by day, with urgency,
in nine diary notebooks.
And even as time was running out,
he made a point of writing extensively
about the shooting of this film...
and of his part in it...
an actor playing himself,
unaware how his role will end.
May 3, 1942...
At 10 a.m. The propaganda crew arrived.
They started to take
pictures in my office.
First, they staged a scene of rabbis
and petitioners entering my office, etc.
Then they removed
all the paintings and charts...
and brought in a nine-armed
candlestick with all the candles lit.
May 7, 1942...
On the streets, they are filming Jews.
Oh God!
What if I see someone I know?
I keep thinking that among all these people,
I might see my mother walking.
Leszno, the main street, was full of traffic.
I remember that once they filmed people.
Germans would often show up, usually for unpleasant reasons and usually shooting.
So, when they were filming, it was much more positive.
Anyhow, it was never good news when Germans showed up.
By this time in the Ghetto,
I was independent.
I was already 8 or 9 years old.
My mother let me play in the courtyard, and I went to all sorts of places by myself.
So, yes, I saw them filming.
They filmed beggars and all sorts of passersby.
At the time, I didn't realize that they had deliberate intentions.
But of course they did.
May 14, 1942...
The film crew is still
very much in evidence.
They are filming both the luxury
and the extreme poverty.
When I returned home at 4 o'clock,
I found uniformed filmmakers, etc.
They decided to film in our apartment.
I requested that a couple
be engaged as actors.
They placed a sign on the door
with something written on it.
Two women and a male "lover"
were brought to the apartment...
and they started filming.
In the meantime,
an old Jew with a Vandyke beard...
was seized on the street.
He sat in my apartment for hours,
but his photogenic qualities
were not used.
I can imagine what happened
when he returned home...
and tried to tell his wife
that he had earned nothing...
while waiting for three hours
to be a "star."
I wonder whether I will ever meet you,
my professional colleague.
Did we not both miss our destiny?
What on earth?
Where did one ever see a flower?
We would have eaten the flower.
Who could stay in their private apartment... with their furniture and their teapot? Who?
Only the privileged, like Czerniakow.
Jewish families weren't allowed to live in more than one room.
So, we took all the belongings we still had... and squeezed into one room.
At the same time, a family we had never met before... suddenly took over my parents' bedroom.
When they reduced the area of the Ghetto, we got expelled from our home, and we had to find a new place to live within two days.
We found a place and started to take our belongings there.
We were given a room and a kitchen.
And my father hired a man who had a cart with no horse.
Once, as we were pushing the cart... loaded with our possessions back and forth, we saw them filming near "Femina."
When we realized that we were in their way, my father got scared and let go of the reins.
The German jumped on him and beat him... until he fell down and the cart rolled away.
I started screaming like crazy.
My father was lying on the ground.
"Stop screaming," he said,
"or they'll beat you too!"
I put my hand over my mouth and stopped screaming, and the Germans left us alone and continued filming.
I looked up and saw two men... standing by a camera tripod.
They were filming outside.
The Ghetto was not a comfortable
work environment...
for the S.S. Officers who carried out
its step-by-step destruction.
They set up their headquarters
outside the Ghetto walls,
in the Brühl Palace,
located in the Aryan part of Warsaw.
In May 1942, their commander was the young
Kommissar S.S. Officer Heinz Auerswald,
who submitted to his superiors
weekly reports.
He described the developments
in the Ghetto,
including executions
he himself had ordered,
in the passive voice,
as though these things
happened by themselves.
Weekly Report, May 5, 1942:
The filming currently underway
in the Ghetto continues,
despite the lack of cooperation
by the inhabitants.
During the filming in the Ghetto,
there was an upheaval
in the Jewish prison.
When the film crew showed up...
with representatives
of the Jewish Council,
panic broke out among the prisoners.
Those imprisoned for leaving
the Ghetto illegally were convinced...
that they were about to be executed.
Women and children fainted.
Everyone calmed down...
only after the real purpose
of the visit became clear.
May 19, 1942...
Waiting for Auerswald's
phone call about the film.
In the afternoon,
a hall was prepared for filming...
where a ball with champagne
is to be held tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.
"The Ladies"are to wear evening dresses.
A messenger arrived
with instructions...
that I am to play the role of the host.
I called Auerswald,
who forbade me to perform.
He said that I should be
at the community center at 7:30,
as something might still change.
This means that the matter
has not yet been settled.
Will I have the strength to acquit
myself honorably from this affair?
Later I saw a hearse full of flowers...
taken from the cemetery
to the ballroom.
The city is full of rumors
about deportations.
They are talking
about tens of thousands.
Purposeful work under such
conditions is admirable,
and yet we do it every day.
For years, researchers tried to discover
who had made this film,
but none of the files...
not one of the documents they uncovered...
could solve the mystery.
Only later, in the 1960s, a lead was
discovered in the Warsaw City Archives.
It was a German entry permit
to the Ghetto,
issued at the time
of the shooting of the film.
A single document that disclosed one name:
Willy Wist,
along with his profession: Cameraman.
Willy Wist, who gave up filming
right after the war...
and became a scrap-metal merchant,
took great pains to cover his tracks,
burning copies of films
he had shot during the war.
Of all those involved,
he was the only one to be exposed.
Years later, when the German courts began
to prosecute local war criminals,
including the lawyer, former S.S.
Kommissar of the Warsaw Ghetto,
Heinz Auerswald, Wist was
among those called on to testify.
Court transcripts record exactly
what he was asked and what he replied,
providing for the first time a point
of view of the man behind the camera.
Herr Wist, the court would like to know... whether you were ever assigned to the Warsaw Ghetto during the war.
Yes.
In 1942, I was sent there from Berlin with three other reporters, cameramen and photographers.
We were stationed in Warsaw.
I worked there as a cameraman.
When exactly was this?
Probably in the winter of'41 -'42.
Herr Wist, allow me to refresh your memory.
This is your entry permit to Warsaw.
It is probably true that I was in Warsaw in May 1942.
I most likely said winter because...
I remember being in Warsaw... when nature was still hibernating.
Did you or your colleagues have any idea... what awaited you in the Warsaw Ghetto?
On our way to Warsaw, we cameramen... had no idea what awaited us there.
Like many times before, we were simply told curtly that we should film there.
I clearly remember filming trade on the streets.
We also filmed... street scenes... and overcrowded houses.
In this context,
I remember being told to film... a large pile of feces in the courtyard of one of the buildings.
I remember thinking to myself... that either because of the winter... or because of the overcrowding, the sanitary installations had stopped working.
Do you see the garbage?
People would throw their garbage out of their windows... because they were too weak to go downstairs.
Hungry people become apathetic.
They don't care anymore.
The piles of garbage are real.
I was ten years old at the time.
I was actually the dominant figure of my family.
Mother would send me to the Warsaw municipal garbage dump, and when I'd return home,
I saw how they were eating what I had brought.
May 5, 1942...
In the afternoon,
the filmmakers were busy...
in the bedroom of Zabludowsky's neighbors.
They brought in a woman who had
to put on lipstick in front of a mirror.
In addition to all this, there are
persistent rumors about deportations,
which appear not to be unfounded.
Kommissar Auerswald ordered us
to provide a contingent of 900 people...
to leave tomorrow for an unknown camp.
Have you met the Kommissar in charge of the Jewish quarter, Dr. Auerswald?
I am not familiar with this name.
I had nothing to do with his department.
Herr Wist, could you tell us, to the best of your knowledge, whether the purpose of the film was ever mentioned?
I never knew what the purpose of the films we shot was.
However, it was absolutely clear to me that they were intended for propaganda, particularly because we were focusing on the extreme differences... between the rich and the poor Jews
Oy, I remember that woman.
She used to walk around with her baby in her arms, screaming, and asking for a piece of bread.
I was 13 years old.
I used to smuggle Kosher meat into the Warsaw Ghetto... by tram, through houses near the Ghetto borders, through holes in the wall.
I was always on the move, so I saw everything that was going on.
They filmed all the time.
For example, they brought geese to the market... to prove that Jews were living in reasonable conditions.
This is horse meat.
Not everyone could afford it.
People who had goods or money... were able to buy food up until the very end, albeit at exorbitant prices.
There were 20, or possibly 50 people... who could afford it.
However, most people had nothing to eat, nothing to wear, or to heat with because they had sold everything.
They were waiting to die.
People from respectable families... would take their loved ones, who had died, out to the pavement.
In the morning, you woke up to find a corpse every 100 meters.
I was 18 years old and I worked at the post office.
One day I was walking on Leszno Street... when, suddenly, a big jeep with Germans in it... pulled up next to the café.
A young woman was lying next to the café.
Sixty years later, I still remember... what she looked like, though not her face.
I could see exactly what they were doing.
They didn't touch anyone.
They filmed the cafe and the woman and they laughed.
She was a young woman.
By then it was obvious who was starving.
You could see it on their faces.
Financial Report:
During March 1942,
the following were brought in:
2. 18 kgs flour per head,
0. 199 kg sugar
(white and yellow) per head,
1/5 egg per head,
0.93 kg fresh vegetables per head,
0.077 kg salt (white and grey) per head.
Since 1/5th of an egg per month
amounts to only 2.4 eggs per year,
it is evident that the population
resorts to free trade...
in order to ensure
a minimum level of nourishment.
Smuggling along the Ghetto walls
has been greatly reduced lately.
A number of Jews
caught smuggling were shot,
as a consequence,
the smuggling was reduced.
This is Rubinstein! For heaven's sake!
"Alle gleich," everyone's equal, he used to yell.
Do you see how people were lying on the street?
People lived here.
They lived here until they died.
What's the point of showing this?
To show contrasts? There were many contrasts in the Ghetto.
Many people kept clean and preserved their dignity.
We used to shower and brush our teeth every day.
Our mother took good care of us, even though the conditions were impossible.
People who are not starving to death... don't surrender their humanity.
People made jokes in the Ghetto and laughed.
Sometimes we would even sing.
People did what they could.
That was the tremendous contrast... and paradox that the Germans had created.
Herr Wist, were you aware of the restlessness among the Jews.. when the camera crews showed up accompanied by the S. S?
On the one hand, I was unable to have much contact with the Jews.. because the S.S. Immediately pushed them away.
On the other hand, they brought us Jews... they deemed appropriate for filming.
I do not know which department these S.S. Men belonged to... or who their commander was.
I'd like to point out that the Jews were frightened of the S.S.
There were no incidents during the filming.
While the Nazis recorded
their own version of history,
Jews were risking their lives
by creating in secret...
their own chronicle of life in the Ghetto,
using pen and paper instead of a camera.
Historian Emanuel Ringelblum,
courageous enough at the war's outset
to predict how it would end,
had begun organizing
a vast underground archive,
documenting the daily struggle
and annihilation...
of one of Europe's largest
Jewish communities.
Recognizing that a scholarly narrative
could never capture...
the many facets of this tragedy,
he called on anyone capable of resistance
to keep a personal journal.
Right up to his final days
in his place of hiding,
he carried out the task of compiling
dozens of individual voices...
into a multilayered portrait...
the final portrait.
Everyone wrote: Journalists, writers,
teachers, public figures,
the young and even children.
Everyone was aware of the value
of the work being done...
and its importance for future generations.
Our guiding principle was
that the work should be multifaceted.
Our second principle was objectivity.
We aspired to present the whole truth,
as bitter as it may be.
Some of my friends who know
about my secret diary...
have suggested that, given their
despair, I should stop writing.
"Why are you doing this? What for?
Will you ever publish it?
"Will your words ever reach the ears
of future generations?"
Nevertheless, I don't listen to them.
I feel that continuing the diary...
until I am no longer physically
and emotionally capable...
is a historical mission
that must not be underestimated.
My powers of creation
have not yet been silenced,
even though I haven't eaten
anything in five days.
They continue filming everything
inside the Ghetto.
All the scenes are being staged.
On Smocza Street,
they assembled a crowd of Jews..
and ordered the Jewish policemen
to disperse them.
To achieve a more "natural"effect,
guns were fired in the air
to induce people to flee in panic.
Forty-five years passed
from the moment...
the unfinished propaganda
film was discovered...
until chance revealed another film reel,
containing outtakes...
frames from the raw footage
left on the cutting-room floor.
Images that were never meant to be seen...
now revealed repeated attempts
to stage moments over and over again...
until a take seemed credible enough.
They reveal the multiple angles
from which these scenes were filmed,
as well as the cameramen themselves,
inadvertently captured
in one another's lens.
Do you know who told you and the other reporters what to film?
We were brought to the various locations by a man wearing an S. A... or brown party uniform.
We called him "Goldpheasant."
Can you recall his name and rank?
I have no idea what his name was.
Judging from his appearance, he must have held an important position.
I believe he was in charge of propaganda matters in Warsaw.
Could you describe what kind of contact you had... with this so-called "Goldpheasant?"
"Goldpheasant" sent us... to various scenes or groups of people.
He never gave us any explanation concerning the meaning of our filming.
He simply said that he wanted us to film this or that.
As far as I could tell, he knew nothing about film.
We constantly had to point out that under the given light conditions, we couldn't deliver reasonable pictures.
We didn't have a chance to express ourselves.
We were sent by "Goldpheasant"... to locations, to people, or groups of people.
You were not given a chance to express yourselves freely?
No, we were not.
I know for a fact that the film was processed in Berlin.
We were never told what happened with it after that.
Today they set up a film session
in Szulc's restaurant.
They rounded up well-dressed,
typical Jews,
seated them at the tables,
and ordered that they be served...
at the expense of the Jewish community:
Fish, geese, liquor,
pastries and other delicacies.
The Jews ate and the Germans filmed.
It is not hard to imagine
the motivation behind this:
Let the world see the paradise
in which the Jews are living.
These despicable scenes went on for hours.
Yesterday morning, the Germans
took all the waitresses outside.
The girls were lined up on the street...
and were instructed
to look happy and attractive.
At the same time,
they grabbed beggar-children...
and told them to walk
by the elegant waitresses...
with their hands out,
into which nothing was put.
This was recorded on film, to show
that while the Jews live in luxury,
they share nothing with the hungry.
My mother also wore her beautiful coat, maybe even a hat. So what?
Does that mean that life goes on as usual?
After the filming, these people vanished... after being loaded onto trucks or caught in some other way.
Perhaps they believed that being filmed would save them, but no way!
Their fate was the same as everyone else's.
Weekly Report, May 19, 1942...
There are rumors that gas was used
for the first time in this war,
on the German side.
Rumors about new resettlements from
Warsaw have been circulating for days...
and have created an enormous panic.
As usual, the "rumor-makers"
know from a "reliable source"...
that the German authorities intend
to resettle the Jews of Warsaw...
in the East.
The next morning at 8 a.m.,
all the actors were ordered to appear...
at the New Azazel Theater.
During the rehearsals
with the actors on the stage,
a group of soldiers picked up people.
People started running and panic ensued,
in the midst of which the Germans
treated everyone to heavy beatings.
Since no one knew why
they were being held there,
you could hear
the sighs and groans...
of the children who were picked up
together with their parents.
After each actor finished his part,
the audience had to yell "Bravo!"
The audience in the theater was held...
until the filming was finished at 8 p. M...
without food or any opportunity
to take care of their bodily needs.
When an actor sang happy songs,
the audience was ordered
to roar with laughter.
Woe to anyone who didn't laugh properly.
His fate was doomed.
They laughed as they had
never laughed before.
The Germans ordered all the actors
to overact as much as possible.
David Seiderman sang "My Yiddisher Mame."
Ruth Zandberg, who accompanied him
on the piano, wept bitterly.
Her mother, Yiddish actress Zusha
Zandberg, had just died of typhus.
The scope of the film is quite broad.
The filmmakers are interested in every
aspect of Jewish life in the Ghetto.
It isn't hard to guess
their intentions...
for this "artistic"project.
They aim to capture
very "objectively"...
aspects of the so-called
Jewish folk character.
In front of our eyes unfolds
the prologue to a great tragedy.
Even though we don't know its name,
we can sense what it's about.
The name of the prologue:
"A Jewfilm."
A group of artists arrived
from Germany...
with a list of scenes which
the community must prepare for them.
At that point, even the blind
could see where things stood.
The community had to prepare
a circumcision ceremony, a wedding,
the Sabbath, both in the synagogue
and the cemetery, and holidays.
This clearly had one intention:
To prove to the "righteous gentiles"
in Hitler's camp that they are right,
that there is only one way
to deal with the Jews: Annihilation.
I'd like to read you excerpts from the diary... of the Chairman of the Judenrat, in Warsaw, Adam Czerniakow.
Czerniakow wrote daily entries in his diary mentioning the filming.
The diary of the Chairman of the Judenrat survived?
Yes. I'll read you the following entry from May 1942.
You may interrupt and add details.
Czerniakow writes:
May 12, 1942...
Yesterday, they filmed
a demonstration of a circumcision.
They insisted that the circumcision
take place...
in a private apartment
instead of a hospital.
Since the "actor"weighs less than 2 kgs,
there is a danger
that he might not live very long.
I cannot recall this event.
It may have been filmed by other members of the crew.
Babies were born. Woe to those babies.
It was the end for them and the end for their families.
Apparently, my mother also got pregnant.
I remember my mother coming back from somewhere... and lying down in bed for two days.
I guessed that... she must have had an abortion.
And I think to myself how lucky we were... that this happened in the spring of'42.
If it had been three months later, when the deportation started, we might have all been sent to our death because of that baby.
This week they invented
a new way to torture us.
First, they rounded up dozens
of pretty young women...
and brought them to a Jewish ritual bath.
Then, men were rounded up
and brought to the same ritual bath.
While one Nazi whipped the heads
of those who were captured,
his colleague stood in a corner
with film equipment.
This is not slander. Here is the film.
I now recall... that one day we were told to shoot inside a ritual bath.
We were then brought to a rather old building... which had a bath on the ground floor or in the cellar.
Several naked women hesitantly stepped into the bath.
There were about 8 of them, standing up to their hips in water.
One was an old Jewish woman, who I believe was also in the water.
She murmured something which I understood to be prayers.
These were women who were somewhat better fed.
It was difficult to film in the bath because we didn't have enough light.
Today the Germans set up
an original film scene...
at the corner of Nowolipki
and Smocza Streets.
They used the finest hearse we have,
which was taken by the Germans
for the purpose of the film.
They want to prove that Jews
not only live a comfortable life,
but also die with dignity
and even get a luxurious burial.
No good will come to us
from this film craziness.
But Jews don't bury their dead in a coffin!
In the spring of'42, there were corpses on the sidewalks.
Someone like me, who could still walk, had to make her way between the corpses.
I hurried along the walls like a mouse, and suddenly a car pulled up.
Two Germans stepped out... and a third pointed a camera at the corpses.
I hid.
People who still looked more or less human... were kindly asked to walk by the corpses with their heads held high.
They walked by and came back, and walked by again and came back again.
It's true that we had to walk by.
No one looked, it was impossible.
We became indifferent to the suffering of others... because otherwise, it was impossible to live.
It was so terrifying because
I could be the next in line.
When it was already dark... and I was walking down Karmelitzka street, which was crowded with people,
I tripped on something... and lost my balance.
When I opened my eyes,
I saw that I had fallen on a corpse.
My face was nearly touching his, and I was shaking.
Then suddenly, it was as if all the corpses which
I had previously avoided looking at, were there, in the face of this one man.
It was a human being.
I got home and I told my mother what had happened.
It was only then that I started to cry,
I cried a lot.
I had always been so optimistic and strong, but suddenly it all broke down.
My mother took out some bread and spread some jam on it for me.
She gave me a slice of bread.
A slice of comfort.
May 1942.
The Warsaw Ghetto.
This was filmed by one
of Willy Wist's colleagues,
who had new film stock in color,
as well as his own personal camera.
It seems that he found time
to record personal memento of Ghetto life,
as well as of the making of the film,
including the large crowd scenes
staged by the film crew.
Here is the funeral procession.
And here, the market.
And for a brief second,
one of the cameramen...
can be seen caught in the frame.
Can you recall anything else about the filming in the Ghetto?
In the Warsaw Ghetto,
I remember seeing... a Jew going around with a handcart carrying corpses.
I saw how he picked up a corpse in front of one of the houses... and continued to the cemetery.
I remember seeing an arm and a leg hanging down.
At the entrance to the cemetery, there was some sort of shack... in which corpses were piled up.
There were some 40 or 50 corpses which still had to be buried.
I filmed this shack from the outside.
Today, I cannot watch this.
I am no longer immune.
Today I am human, today I can cry.
I am so happy that I can cry... now that I'm human.
I recall that I had to film a mass grave... with many layers of corpses.
I cannot say how many layers there were... beneath the layer which I could see.
I remember the corpses being eased into the grave on a slide.
Two Jewish workers were standing inside the grave, arranging the corpses next to one another.
I have a vague memory that the corpses were strewn with chloride.
Although I believe that the corpses were naked,
I am not certain about this.
The people were all skin and bones.
At the time, my impression was that the people had died of starvation.
These impressions in Warsaw had a profound impact on me, although later,
I got to see quite a lot.
They preoccupied my thoughts for quite some time.
Herr Wist, during the filming, you were really unaware of the plans to resettle and physically annihilate... thewish population in the near future?
I can only say that at the time,
I definitely knew nothing... of the horrible fate awaiting thews of Warsaw.
It was only after the war that I learned... about the planned extermination of thews in the Treblinka death camp.
During the filming in the Warsaw Ghetto,
I often had the opportunity to talk to thews... who had been sent there from Germany.
From these conversations, my impression was that they were full of hope... and that they expected... to be resettled in Madagascar or elsewhere.
They regarded their stay in Warsaw as temporary.
I am absolutely convinced that at the time they had no idea... what their real fate would be.
Although at the time, the malnourishment of the population... in Warsaw was appalling,
I never thought that these people... would be systematically murdered.
After 30 days of shooting,
the film crew packed up its cameras
and lighting equipment and was gone.
Less than two months later,
S.S. Officers appeared
in the office of Czerniakow,
the head of the Judenrat,
instructing him to draw up a list...
of many thousands Jews
for immediate deportation to Treblinka.
Czerniakow was most likely aware that
Treblinka was no more than a mass grave.
The following day, when the quotas oews
were significantly raised,
he swallowed the cyanide capsule he had
kept since the start of the war,
and in the silence of his death,
signaled his people: "This is the end."
These were also the days during which
the propaganda film was being edited.
Soon it would be buried
in the stacks of the archive.
On its box, a single title:
The Ghetto.

What the heII...
-My God!
-Jesus! Jesus!
Why, you're ItaIian.
And you... who are you?
-Were you on that train?
-Damn right I was.
Damned miserabIe woods.
You scared me to death.
These Germans, first they shoot and then ask, who's there?
You're teIIing me.
Maybe you can teII me where the heII we are.
I'd say it's Germany, huh.
Anyway, what I say is we're better off here...
-...than on the train.
-That's for sure.
That train is a bIast furnace.
-Poor bastards.
-Yes, poor them.
You know, I'm not reaIIy wounded.
I've got to be a deserter, or worse... by now.
Worse. No doubt about that.
Faking a wound...
Anyway...
It's pretty good.
It Iooks reaI, my Iad.
I saved myseIf, but I was heIped out... by a dead man, may his souI rest in peace.
With aII due respect for the dead...
I had to take his bandages.
Instead of being in
StaIingrad, I'm here.
So, I said to my men, where are we going?
What are we doing, running around Iike this?
Who wants to go around kiIIing?
Let's go. Go back home.
You can't work for peopIe... who send you out here with cardboard shoes.
Here, where when you bIow your nose you get... a crystaI chandeIier, and when you shit... you get icicIes.
So I grabbed two trucks and sent the men home.
I hope they made it.
They wouId have had me shot tomorrow.
I hate the miIitary courts here.
-How Iong is this river!
-It must be the Rhine.
-Where's that?
-It's stiII in Germany.
Then it's stiII a pain in the ass.
Damn!
-Who were they?
-Maybe they are Jews.
-That's impossibIe.
-It's possibIe... and we happen to be as guiIty as they are.
We're accompIices to those rotten shits.
Why do you think that we're accompIices?
Because we didn't make a sound... didn't come out and spit in their faces.
We couId have, but we ran instead.
That's crazy.
How couId we have?
They'd have come after us and we'd be shot.
UseIess suicide.
No, it wouIdn't have been useIess... because in the face of certain things you've got... to say no, and instead,
I said yes... to MussoIini, to duty, and to aII that crap.
In this war I've kiIIed... bastards I didn't even know.
I kiIIed before the war, but I had my reasons.
I kiII Iike an idiot, for no reason.
Did it for a woman.
I kiIIed for a woman...
A woman...
She must be kidding!
What more do you want?
Screw off!
Let's see you dance... waIking crow!
Screw off! Drop dead.
How about Ietting me tickIe you aII over?
You can tickIe your Mama!
I'II give you something, so don't push.
Nothing easy about me!
-What a Iass!
-We want more!
What do you want me to do?
There! There!
Give us more!
-Take it off!
-Come on!
Forget it! Fuck you!
There! There!
-PasquaIino!
-Let's taIk, Concetti.
Look at yourseIf in the mirror.
Go on, take a Iook at yourseIf.
Are you pretty?
No, you're not pretty.
You're not even inteIIigent.
Among Mom and our sisters... there isn't a penny.
I'm the onIy man in the house with eight women... there's one thing
I've tried to defend.
One thing, our honor!
To defend and protect that honor as best I can... not being the biggest or strongest man in the worId.
I carry this thing around,
I wear this gun.
They know about it, and they have to respect us.
And you ugIy, miserabIe pig... put your disgusting thighs in dispIay... in a musicaI... because that Iousy rat said he'd make you famous.
That fiIthy bastard who heIped to get you started... and gave you this job.
I'II kiII him.
-No!
-I'II shoot him.
You mustn't! I beg you.
He'II marry me!
He promised!
I'm going on 37.
I'II be a spinster!
Better a spinster than a whore!
-I must kiII him.
-No!
Potono'II marry me.
First he'II make me somebody...
-...then his bride.
-Somebody!
Somebody! Come on...
Look at yourseIf, a squawking crow.
Didn't you hear them?
DisgracefuI! What a shame!
I'II kiII that Potono!
No, I'm through! I have a much better contract.
He'II heIp me sing at the CIub Margarita... then he'II marry me.
He made a promise.
He Ioves me very much.
One month, eh?
I give him one month... to straighten things up.
Our house mustn't be dishonored.
You understand, idiot?!
Understand?
Imagine the eIdest becoming a whore!
What wiII the others do, become whores?
He's got a month to to marry you... or I'II kiII him.
The word of PasquaIino
Seven Beauties.
Do you understand?
Rosina, my carnation.
Coming right up, PasquaIino.
Damn Francesco! After aII this time in Africa.
Now they're sending him to Spain.
We needed another war.
It wasn't enough Iast time.
Now we'II never get married.
Don't give up hope. Because with God's heIp... he may stiII be Iucky enough to get a nice wound... in his Ieg or his arm.
You'd get a pension for Iife and you'd be set.
-What are you saying?
-Or he'II Iose an eye.
What crazy taIk, Mama!
Hey, Mama, we don't enjoy such Iucky accidents...
-...in our famiIy.
-Yes, of course.
It wiII pass.
Grandma.
Rough up those mattresses.
PasquaIino,
Ieave it in the drawer.
Are you Iooking for troubIe?
Hey, Mama, it doesn't get you into troubIe...
They Iearn to fear you, and respect you.
And beIieve me, they aII respect me.
Excuse us for a moment, famiIy business.
You'II pardon us?
He has to taIk to them in private.
We have business to discuss.
-It's a big secret.
-Who gives a damn!
Quiet. You can't trust them to Iick Leno's famiIy...
Is that cIear?
Mama, Iook, money to buy groceries.
-Lucky Mama.
-I'm sick of bread and onions.
Buy an egg for each one of you... and be carefuI of cheats.
It'd disgust anybody... to Iook at such yeIIow faces.
There's a Iot to be done if they're ever to get married.
Stop that!
Now, Iisten to me.
Don't Iet anybody see your eyes, Iook down... or you may be taken for a cheap IittIe tart.
And I'II beat the first one who misbehaves. Remember.
SmiIe, no reason to be upset Iike that.
Cheer up.
Have a good day.
And you too, LouiseIIe.
And you too. Hmm?
Don't Iook so gIoomy, eh?
SmiIe for a change!
What's the matter with you?
What the heII do you think you're doing?
Don't stop singing!
We need the money!
Understand? Go on, sing!
You, get going!
LittIe girI, have your parrot teII my fortune.
-Why the tears?
-It's my mother's fauIt.
I never couId sing,
I go off pitch.
To make me sing is wrong.
Don't make fun of me.
But it doesn't matter, you can yeII.
The men bother me.
They make fun and tease.
Can't you answer back?
If anyone faiIs to respect you...
You just say that you're my fiancee. Hmm?
In these words.
Say you're engaged to
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
But I'm not your fiancee.
It's faIse.
At the moment. In a few years, things couId happen.
Never try to predict the weather, or the future.
Think about growing up.
Say, come on, try.
Even you started steaIing from the cradIe.
JeaIousy is an ugIy thing.
Excuse me, Don RaphaeIe,
I don't understand.
What's the matter?
I've aIways been IoyaI.
It's not about IoyaIty.
I'm interested in peopIe who know how to show respect.
What are you taIking about?
What are you referring to?
I'II teII you what I'm referring to.
I'm taIking about someone... who doesn't respect his famiIy.
-In what sense?
-I'II teII you.
At 3 o'cIock, you'd better be at the PoIonetto.
Have a Iook around. See what they're doing to you.
Potono bought your sister a pair of shoes... with red bows on them, and put her in there for Iife.
We have a cIient.
My God! It's my brother!
-Who is he?
-No, it's her brother!
Prostitute!
Stupid bitch!
Are you satisfied now... your fiance got you into this business? Idiot!
What a disgrace! You brought dishonor on us!
Let go! Get the heII out of my way!
TeII me where he is... or I'II murder you, do you hear me?!
How do I find that son of a bitch?!
I can't breathe.
Let go of my throat first!
This is how he married you, that Iousy bastard.
Disgracing our house!
Where is he?
-Right here.
-FiIth! Go home!
How can I, dressed this way?
-Take this.
-Go Iike this.
Go home!
No, PasquaIino! No!
Don't kiII him!
I Iove him, pIease!
Screw you and your Iove! Idiot!
Eighteen Karat Potono, is that you?
-Damn right.
-Damn right.
Weren't you going to marry my sister, Concettina?
You promised and therefore you'II marry her.
Who are you? Who the heII do you think you are?
MiserabIe worm. Get out.
I didn't understand.
Does that heIp you understand? Have a good day.
-Poor boy.
-WiII he be aII right?
Get that mess out of here!
We've got customers!
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is that rotten son of a bitch? Where'd he go?
It's reaIIy not worth bothering about.
Isn't it? I'm going to chop his head off.
Scum, humiIiating me.
He won't Iive Iong.
Eighteen Karat Potono... wake up!
I won't shoot out the brains of a sIeeping man.
Come on, wake up.
Wake up. It's me.
No, Jesus! Don't shoot.
You're the one who caused it.
You caIIed me miserabIe worm, remember?
Find that pistoI, I need it.
Find it and be quick! It's important to my defense.
He's dead.
Where the heII are we?
Hey, Jesus, what...
I smeII onions.
Ah, Signora.
Good morning, goet morgen.
Excuse me for coming in without permission. Stay quiet.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm hungry.
I'm an ItaIian soIdier.
Understand? No?
That's aII right.
FrauIien Deutsche.
Oh, something to eat.
ItaIian soIdier, NapIes.
Sunshine, bIue water... mandoIins.
Understand? A pizza pie with tomatoes on top... or macaroni. There's food in here. I'm starving!
Ah, Deutsche soup.
Nice and hot.
Signora, I'm hungry.
I'II have some bread... with your permission.
Oh, bread with stew?
It's so good. Our Mama often gave us stew in NapIes.
A Mama, Signora, is never forgotten.
You're a Mama too. Your daughter at the piano... she'II catch coId with her bare ass out.
Hard times, Signora, the war's been responsibIe.
Shh, if someone's there,
I... no, it's aII right.
Soup, bread, potatoes...
I'm taking some bread for my friend.
He's ItaIian.
This is for him.
A drop of wine, cin-cin, saIute.
Good wine. Guten.
I'd Iike to be your guest...
Your daughter, she has a great ass... but I have to run.
Thank you.
May you Iive to be a hundred.
Oh, saIami... saIami and some cheese.
Dankeschun, Bitteschun, auf wiedersehn...
Good night, Signora.
What's that about?
Groundsport. A mysterious word, amigo.
We must work occasionaIIy, or eIse acid bath...
-...or crematorium.
-How d'you know? Who're you?
That's how it is.
I'm a death expert.
I know an anarchist whose bombs didn't work.
MussoIini, HitIer,
CeIIezar.
I've got faiIure after faiIure.
These peopIe have made a business out of death.
That goddamn rotten whore!
What's the worId coming to?
How the heII did the worId ever get Iike this?
And we Iet ourseIves get kiIIed this way.
Nobody says anything.
The Jews, who were supposed to be so smart...
The brave Russians... who began the revoIution... they're not rebeIIing.
My rotten Iuck, ending up in this shitpiIe.
Jesus! They're pIaying waItz.
My God! My God!
Like sheep about to be sIaughtered.
It can't be.
Francesco,
I don't want to die.
I can't accept that.
I'm stiII young.
I had a miserabIe Iife.
I wouId've Iiked to change it, but I never managed to.
I can't die Iike this.
I just can't die Iike this.
I'II try and get out of here.
I'II do it! I'II find a way to get out of here...
Starting at this moment.
A woman is a woman,
PasquaIino.
And a woman, even one who is an eviI person, has... a IittIe good for someone who can reach her heart.
There's a bit of sugar aIways there.
The song goes...
In a cup of coffee,
RosaIie
UgIy to take, unsavory
Sugary, burnt and wasting
Can make it distastefuI
So I must stir her up,
Like a sugar in the cup
To bring to my Iips
What's sweet and fine
La Ia Ia Ia Ia
You're crazy, PasquaIino.
Yes, but I must try.
It's dangerous.
She's crueI, sadistic.
I understand aII that.
But I had a vision.
It was a song, something my Mama said... that bit of sugar,
I know it's there.
Soon, no matter how rotten she is... or how eviI, she's no exception.
She must need Iove.
I'm right, Franche.
You're educated, but in the matter of women...
-I'm way ahead of you.
-I'm sure you'd be.
Do you know how peopIe used to caII me?
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
-They did?
-Because I'm ugIy.
You Iook terribIe, aII right.
But that was the point.
In spite of my Iooks...
I appeaIed to women.
They Ioved me.
PeopIe were amazed.
They'd say, it's unbeIievabIe. he's repuIsive.
Others repIied... he must have the Seven Beauties...
That's how it came to be my name, see?
No, but I beIieve you.
I appeaI to the Iadies.
I used to appeaI to them.
The fact is... without any exaggeration...
I haven't Iooked at the mirror in years.
And since I know from the beginning... that I've aIways been an ugIy man...
I'II admit it's been bothering me.
How have I turned out?
My teeth have become Ioose.
I can't keep my eyes open.
My ass has dropped.
Look at me and teII me honestIy.
How do I Iook?
AwfuI, to be quite honest.
I'd forget it.
No! I'm bound to be kiIIed, so why not?
I want to Iive, have chiIdren.
See my chiIdren's chiIdren, and more... and the chiIdren of my chiIdren's chiIdren.
AII the chiIdren
I can possibIy have.
-BuIIshit, amigo.
-You pig!
How dare you teII me what to do!
Who are you?! How dare you insuIt me Iike that?!
Come on, that's nonsense, you're taIking buIIshit... because the more chiIdren you have... the faster the end wiII come.
In what sense?
What do you mean?
In the year 1400 there were
500 miIIion peopIe on earth.
By the year 1850 the amount had doubIed to one biIIion.
Now we're aII... extremeIy indignant... because of the death of 20 miIIion men... but in 200 or 300 years... there'II be a Iot more of us, 30 biIIion or more.
Anywhere you go on earth wiII be worse than here.
That's when men are going to butcher each other... and murder an entire famiIy... for a piece of bread or an appIe... and the worId wiII end.
Too bad, because
I beIieve in man... but soon... very soon, a new man...
A new man wiII be born.
He'II have to be civiIized... not this beast who's been endowed with inteIIigence... and obIiterated the harmony in the worId... and brought about totaI destruction... just by disturbing nature's equiIibrium.
A new man... abIe to rediscover the harmony that's within.
You mean, put things in order?
Order? No, no...
The orderIy ones are the Germans.
A new man in disorder is our onIy hope.
A new man in disorder.
You made a mistake, boy.
You made a mistake.
You shouId've waited untiI he got his revoIver out.
I waited about 5 minutes, but... he didn't have a gun around.
He didn't have a weapon.
You shouIdn't have shot him... or given Potono a gun.
I onIy had one.
You shouId've had two with you.
You can't never be carefuI enough.
This case demanded the simpIest of care.
You must prepare for the job.
You shouId throw him his gun, defend yourseIf.
He picks the gun up, you shoot him.
You didn't murder him.
SeIf-defense.
Later on, the case comes up, a quick triaI.
In no time you're out and you're respected.
It's a breeze, get it?
Don RaphaeI, how couId I have known?
A reaI man prepares a job with foresight... or eIse anyone at aII wouId be abIe to do it.
Now you're in troubIe... of making it aII disappear.
50% is aII you can hope to get out of it moraIIy.
I'm taIking about respect.
You must make yourseIf a name.
You need Iots of pubIicity.
For this you need discretion.
The man's on a trip now.
He's gone to America.
It's a supposition, but we must be sure.
-He's disappeared.
-Sounds simpIe.
How am I to fix it?
Throw him in the bay?
It'II rise to the top... you'II go straight to prison.
MarveIous, perfect, dammit!
Dear God.
Imagination. A creative effort's needed.
Easy, no?
Like smoking a cigarette.
Smoking cigarettes, anybody can do that.
The man who wants to be something more... needs the guts to perform!
The nerve to do things that normaIIy... no one eIse couId possibIy imagine. Get the point?
I get the point,
Don RaphaeI.
You seem nervous, my boy.
-CaIm down, my boy.
-I am caIm.
There are men at the mention of whose name... the whoIe worId trembIes.
-Get my point, PasquaIino?
-I get it.
You're inteIIigent... you foIIow everything
I teII you.
I foIIow, Don RaphaeI.
As I expIained... you couId make a great start for yourseIf... with this opportunity, or not.
Of course, it's entireIy up to you.
Potono has to disappear.
Don't pay attention... to anyone who taIks about the American system.
TraditionaI cement shoes were invented here in NapIes.
Chicago and New York just make cheap imitations.
It's pIagiarism.
The king-size coffin is our invention.
When you see a funeraI in NapIes, nobody knows... how many bodies are in the coffin.
When things get busy,
2 or 3 can be stuffed in.
Depends on the demand.
We invented everything here in NapIes.
For exampIe, you know the ancient graveyard... weII, when they first opened it... they found 500 skeIetons.
Now, there are 5,000.
The question is, who put the other 4,500 in there?
So, as I said, it depends on the demand.
Oh, God.
He's so ugIy.
Wait a minute, here.
Son of a bitch.
Even dead, you are a pig.
Just a big bag of wind.
I knew it.
Dammit!
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who is it?
Who are you?
Who is it?
Who's there?
What's going on?
Who's there?
What's going on?
-Get going.
-Where to?
To the station.
And hurry.
Damn stupid animaI!
BIind idiot!
You shouId be ashamed of yourseIf!
You have no respect for a poor bIind man!
Son of a bitch!
What is this? Stay back.
Keep your hands off me, pIease. Get back.
WiII you get back!
I don't want any heIp.
I'II manage myseIf.
I don't need heIp. PIease.
-I can manage myseIf.
-He's so strong!
Look. A big cheese box roped up wrong.
CouId you pIease take these?
Thanks.
How did you rap it?
Don't drop anything.
That's enough now!
-Where are you going?
-PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.
You know that shipment of ProkoIoni.
It's been sent off.
PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.
Good-bye.
It was your advice
I foIIowed... about creative thinking.
I don't think you'II hear about it anymore.
He kiIIed my Potono!
PoIice! He kiIIed him!
Live me aIone...
Give up!
You'II never take
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
Never wiII you be abIe to take him aIive.
-Stop bragging.
-So I'm wrong.
Achtung! Achtung!
-Are you out of your mind?
-Don't worry.
-Where are you going?
-Be quiet.
Shit!
Monster of NapIes confesses!
It's PasquaIino and no other. Latest edition!
Big murder story!
-So, you have confessed.
-Yes, Sir.
Nobody in his right mind ever confessed such a thing.
CompIete madness!
I wiII Iook ridicuIous.
What the heII do you think
I can teII the judge, huh?
It's impossibIe to defend this case.
Advocate, this time I Iost.
I'm gIad I confessed,
I'm a man of honor.
You're an asshoIe.
How dare you!
You'II pay for that!
CaIm down, or that'II be...
-the end of my visit.
-Who the heII are you?
Your Iawyer.
Do you want to kiII me as weII?
-Better hoId your tongue.
-Watch that asshoIe stuff.
I wanted to say incompetent.
It's not so simpIe.
I have a great reputation.
You understand, or not?
If you screw yourseIf,
I won't take the case.
How can I defend you if you teII the truth.
The monster of NapIes is captured and confesses.
Who ever heard of such a thing? Confesses...
It's unbeIievabIe!
Look, confesses to cutting up the victim... and shipping the body to 3 different cities.
To do it, I understand.
But to confess...
The onIy thing Ieft for us to do... is pIead insanity.
-I don't get it.
-I'II cIaim you're mad... out of your mind.
ReaIIy? I have to deny an honorabIe act... aimed at protecting the
Ioss of dignity... and pretend I'm a fooI.
Let's forget it, my friend.
Can't you understand?
Don't you see?
You're confused.
Look, they're going to condemn you to death, huh?
It's the firing squad.
I can't pIay the fooI.
I'm sorry about
Don RaphaeI... but I'II have to send you away.
You'II give me a scoop, understand?
-I won't do it.
-What shouId I do?
I have high bIood pressure.
I've got to stay caIm.
Make up your mind.
If you pIead insanity...
I'II defend you... and we may save your neck.
But if you prefer your stupid honor... we'II forget about it, and you're dead.
It's your Iife or your honor.
Think about it, PasquaIino
Porfusso, and Iet me know.
AII right, then, you can see your visitors.
Let the famiIy in now.
Mama! Mama! Mama!
-PasquaIino.
-Mama! -PasquaIino!
-Mama! -My PasquaIino!
-Mama!
-PasquaIino, my son!
-Mama!
Mama.
-My son. -Mama.
-At Iast I can see you.
You're teIIing me...
How you are?
I'm not so weII.
How about you?
Does Don RaphaeI give you anything?
He's been heIping us a IittIe... but not with money, just words... so it's been Ieft for us to manage somehow.
How do you manage?
I'II do aII I can...
-Concettina!
-PasquaIino!
He's a friend.
What do you want?
Your Iawyer's one of the best here in NapIes... recommended by Don RaphaeI.
He costs a Iot.
You did commit the crime.
She's not innocent...
It's one matter not being innocent.
Being a whore is another.
Now sweetheart, have a IittIe patience.
A rotten comedy, a Iousy farce... caIIed Iiving.
Your ass wiII drop... and your beIIy'II get fat without exercise.
Come on, run.
Keep the body beautifuI.
You'II be as good as new.
-ItaIians!
-What now?
Let's weIcome the war for the virtues it brings out... in those of us who have the guts to fight!
We're making history.
Our peopIe are... a race of distant warriors!
Duce! Duce! Duce! Duce!
It's very funny.
Our peopIe are poets and heroes.
-He's out of his mind.
-And that is their fame.
The chaIIenge this breed poses is a threat...
-to aII on earth.
-Take him away, eh?
PoIiticaI?
-No, hatchet kiIIer.
-Oh.
PasquaIino Porfuso,
'The Monster of NapIes'.
The act of an unbaIanced mind, 12 years.
You're Iucky. They gave me
28 years and 4 months.
Twenty-eight?!
How did it come to that?
I simpIy thought.
It's the most atrocious crime a citizen couId commit.
He doesn't want that.
-Ah, you're anti-fascist.
-SociaIist.
To teII the truth, poIitics are boring.
I've other interests.
Papa was a brickIayer. He taIked a IittIe SociaIism.
But I don't think about it anymore... because... because I think
II Duce is pretty great.
To be truthfuI, he's given us roads.
How much he's given, an entire empire.
AII the other countries are jeaIous of our Ieader.
Listening to the man speak to us... that voice, and those eyes... and his court found me compIeteIy insane.
And our peopIe are respected.
They used to spit at us,
ItaIians, on the face.
Remember those days?
Besides, there were many strikes, riots... demonstrations, we used to be in terribIe condition.
And thanks to him, there has been no disorder.
He is a marveI, you're right.
There has been Iaw and order, and... he's done it by outIawing unions and strikes.
The resuIt is that saIaries in 1919 were up... and today, peopIe are making Iess than haIf... whiIe the cost of Iiving has increased 30%.
You didn't know that, huh?
This MussoIini, of whom everyone envies us...
Do you know who envies us?
The IandIords!
The ItaIians are a bunch of fooIs...
Iistening to that man, that bag of air on his baIcony.
Your Duce.
Wait, wait... no.
CarefuI, they'II hear us.
You mentioned the strikes, and the riots?
At Ieast then we knew there was a disease... and we couId hope to get weII.
Now we imagine we're strong... and we hide the disease.
That man wiII bring our country to war.
That's the finaI catastrophe.
You put it weII.
What do you intend to do?
I don't bother with poIitics.
I go to the insane asyIum, stay there for 10 years.
It's just a question of getting things organized... becoming friendIy with some doctor or some nurse.
In NapIes, we're very inventive.
I might get assigned to cIean the women's quarters.
Then I'II have it made.
I'II be on Easy Street.
What do you know, you're awake.
Let me see how weII you've done.
-A IittIe bit.
-That's not much.
Not enough.
To pee is to Iive.
The more you pee, the more you Iive.
PasquaIino, how are you doing?
Do you Iike your new job as intended?
Keep up the good work.
I'm starting procedure... for a new psychiatric test.
You'II see, they'II Iet you out.
We have to put an end to this...
AII the judiciaI cases who end up here...
What are you doing?
What do you think?
A gift from heaven can't go to waste.
I've had no woman now for severaI months.
I'm so sorry, but I must ask you to forgive me.
I must, must have a Iook.
Just keep quiet. Leave it to me, I'm an expert.
Let me pIease you.
You want it.
Stupid bitch! Go to heII!
Shut up. Shut up, you idiot!
Shut up!
What do you want from me?
That'II keep you quiet.
I'II take care of you.
Like to bite, eh?
Rotted whore.
Stinking crazy bitch.
Now we'II show you.
Get his pants off.
Come on, move.
In 7 weeks we'II be out of here.
Then we'II Ieave, aII of us.
In 7 weeks we'II be out of here...
My cigarette!
My cigarette!
My cigarette!
Even though you've done these terribIe things... you're normaI, you can't be shut up in here... with these hopeIess cases.
But you must controI yourseIf.
You know what a revision of your mentaI status entaiIs.
Your behavior is what counts most.
Eight more years here couId drive me crazy.
-I reaIIy mean it.
-I know, I know... but you must make an effort because now is your chance.
PasquaIino, ItaIy is at war now... and they'II be needing aII the men they can get.
They can't be fussy about anyone who voIunteers... even someone coming out of prison.
Of course, this doesn't appIy to mentaI patients.
But if we'II ran psychiatric tests... to demonstrate you've made a compIete recovery...
HeIp me.
I want to go on Iiving.
That isn't asking so much.
HeIp me.
HeIp me...
I'II try my best for you but...
I'm afraid this war wiII end in a terribIe massacre.
It couIdn't be more terribIe than in here.
I'm ready to do anything to get out of here.
I'm ready to do anything to Iive... anything.
I'm ready to do anything...
Crematorium zeks.
AII right. What exactIy is your game, shit macaroni?
Jesus, you speak ItaIian!
Then I can taIk to you.
At Iast, I can taIk to you.
Who are... who are you?
An enchantress, or a magician?
Because you put a speII on me.
When I saw you the first time...
I was... I...
What are you saying, you disgusting macaroni?
I Iove... I'm in Iove with you.
I Iove you very much.
Strip.
What? Did I hear right?
You asked me to strip?
AII right.
I'm wiIIing because I'd
Iike to make you Iaugh... because I Iove you.
You hate me.
You aII despise me.
You want something to eat.
You Iove me to get something to eat...
I'm sorry, Signora.
You know how hungry I am.
But what goes on inside my heart...
You have no idea.
You're right. Everybody hates you. I shouId too.
I shouId hate you because I've never seen... a woman Iike you.
I have to admit
I'm crazy... but the reason I'm crazy is because... because I'm not convinced you are as you seem.
Who are you reaIIy?
I need to know who you are.
TeII me the truth.
No. Of course you're not a witch or an enchantress.
I'm convinced you're just a poor victim. Yes.
You're a victim because you're forced into... forced to kiII...
You kiII out of a sense of duty.
Not a witch at aII, you are a victim, Iike we are.
There's a reaI femaIe under that uniform... and imagine the rosy fIesh, deIicate and beautifuI... and soft to touch.
It drives me out of my head.
Yes, I've gone out of my head.
To caress sainted fIesh is something I dream about...
Yes, I can hardIy stand on my feet.
I think of you and I become weak.
I'm in Iove. Love is madness, it's a disease.
When you're in Iove, you
Iose aII perspective...
I've gone crazy thinking of you.
That's why I did what I did and that's why I'm here now.
And that's why I'm asking you one big favor, one.
I'm going to be kiIIed and
I ask to be kiIIed by you.
By the touch of your hand.
I beg you, touch me... and I'd be very gIad if you'd kiII me now. Touch me.
You shit, NeopoIitan.
You can hardIy stand.
You cannot keep on pIaying in this comedy of yours.
You want to eat.
Now, you'II make
Iove to me... then I'II kiII you with my bare hands. Verstanden?
-It's what you asked, no?
-Yes, thank you.
You have to be patient.
I Iove you, but I'm weak.
You can't even open your eyes.
You don't have the energy for an erection.
Wake up!
Better eat, NapIes.
Now you eat, afterward you fuck.
If you don't fuck, you're kaput.
Bibi, my first Iove... heIp me get it up.
I want to see your eyes.
Drek.
You disgust me.
Your thirst for Iife disgusts me.
Your Iove disgusts me.
In Paris, there is a Greek... who found strength to make Iove to a goose.
He screwed for what it gave him... something to eat.
It meant survivaI.
And you, sub-human ItaIian.
You found the strength for an erection.
And because you were strong you'II manage to Iive on... and eventuaIIy you'II win.
MiserabIe creature, Iacking in ideaIs and ideas... and we... we who thought to create a master race... are doomed to faiIure.
You're in Barracks No.23, right? Good.
Starting right now, you're to be in charge.
That's an order.
As head of Barracks 23... you are to designate any 6 that you Iike... to be eIiminated at once.
Ya.
Or eIse I eIiminate aII the men.
You are to choose any 6.
And the others may get something to eat... even survive.
You pick 6, or you'II aII be creminated. Understand?
Kaput.
The choice is yours.
You pig, you rotten dirty.
Now you're a butcher Iike the rest of us.
FiIthy sub-human ItaIian.
-No.
-I've got to.
The bitch said so.
Either 6 or aII of us.
Every Iast one of them is doomed to die.
At Ieast we'II save our ass.
No. We'II be just
Iike them...
That's what they want.
We must say no.
And aII the men wiII be dead tomorrow?
AII the men, tomorrow.
Screw off.
Say what you want... but remember who's boss.
Here, Group 3. Whoever they may be, I'm not interested.
Into 14. I don't want to know who they are.
Here, the first 6.
You need onIy 5.
-What do you mean?
-I voIunteer.
You're crazy. Why?
Because I'm fed up with this.
Come on, get in Iine.
It's an order!
It's an order, go on!
Number 9423...
Somebody smuggIed food into Barracks 23.
In addition, stoIen property of the 3rd Reich... was found in Barracks 23.
As punishment for the breaking of reguIations... these 6 men wiII face a firing squad.
Hey!
Enough with this fear!
I've had enough! Living in aII this dark terror!
I'm going to throw myseIf in the shit...
Screw you!
Stop!
Stop!
A man in disorder!
Get him out.
FiIthy rats! Bastards!
Lousy rotten sons of bitches! You fiIth!
-Francesco!
-Dirty pigs!
-Francesco!
-FiIthy murderers!
Enough of your fiIthy kiIIing!
Lousy, rotten, no good animaIs!
-Let me by!
-You're not even men!
France!
Leave him to me.
-Give me...
-SiIIy bastards!
Shut up, Francesco!
You're crazy.
PIease faII down.
Just pretend...
FaII down on the ground.
No, I don't want to Iive any Ionger!
Death can't be any worse than this!
FaII down! Pretend.
PIease shut up!
I'd rather die than
Iive in this shit.
I'II have the satisfaction of yeIIing at them...
-FiIthy pigs!
-You're mad!
-Inhuman sons of bitches!
-France.
Rotten animaIs!
God, what do they want?
What do they want?
I won't shoot him.
Shoot.
Shoot. Hurry up, you'II be freeing me...
Come on, shoot!
Somebody eIse wiII shoot me if you won't.
At Ieast you're my friend.
Now, shoot, pIease...
You'II be doing me a favor.
Shoot!
I won't be tortured any more.
Don't you understand?
I can't pIay the hero much Ionger.
Don't make me ashamed in front of the others.
Shoot! Do me a favor...
Come on!
Go on, shoot, dammit.
Mama, guess!
It's PasquaIino!
PasquaIino is aIive!
He's aIive, I don't beIieve it!
He's aIive! PasquaIi!
PasquaIi! My boy is aII right!
And so you turned out to be a whore too, huh?

Yes.
Good. Now quick, you're giving it up... we're getting married.
There isn't much time to Iose.
I want chiIdren.
Many chiIdren: 25, 30.
It's a matter of seIf-defense.
They must be strong.
Look at the crowds out there.
Soon, they'II be murdering each other... famiIies sIaughtered, for an appIe.
So we must see to it our famiIy is Iarge.
That'II be our defense, understand?

And I'm ready.
We'II get married, the sooner the better.
PIease, PasquaIino, don't worry...
Thank the Madonna for returning you to us.

It's so senseIess.
What's done is done.
Have a Iook at yourseIf, my son.
You're beautifuI.
The war is ended.
It's useIess to think about these miseries...
PasquaIino, you're aIive.
AIive!
Yes, I'm aIive.
She is perhaps Hitler's best-known victim.
Her book has sold more than 25 million copies...
...and has been translated into at least 55 languages.
She's become a symbol of 10 million souls murdered by the Nazis...
...Jews and non-Jews...
...and, in particular, the one and a half million innocent children.
She was just 15 when she died.
A miserable and lonely death in a concentration camp in Germany.
Yet she is remembered for her faith in humanity.
This is the story of the life and legacy of Anne Frank.
In Amsterdam, some of the remnants of a once-thriving Jewish community.
Every person in this congregation, like Jews throughout Europe...
...has a story of their own...
...of persecution, murder, fear or betrayal.
The rabbi spent the first
2 years of his life in hiding...
...sheltered by a Christian family.
But one girl reaches beyond all those memories.
Hers is not just a Holocaust story, for the voice of Anne Frank...
...stands as a warning to those who discriminate on the basis...
...of color, culture or creed.
Her message is as fresh today as it was 50 years ago.
The notorious Nazi propaganda film...
...The Eternal Jew.
Distorted images portraying an Aryan nightmare...
...of the Jewish threat to European civilization.
And this, the family Frank:
Prosperous, cultivated, sophisticated...
...and integrated.
In fact, they were a German family.
German to the core.
The antithesis of ghetto Jews.
Anne's father, Otto, was an officer in the German army...
...in the first World War.
The family had lived in and around
Frankfurt for generations.
But Otto had traveled the world, even working in Macy's store in New York...
...where a college friend,
Nathan Straus, was the owner's son.
In 1925, the 36-year-old Otto married Edith Hollander...
...a 25-year-old Jewish girl from Aachen, Germany...
...near the Dutch border.
They honeymooned in Italy.
Their first daughter, Margot, followed 9 months later...
...and their second, Annelies, better known as Anne, in June 1929.
It was a good life in Frankfurt in those early years.
One could almost forget the long shadow of National Socialism.
But beneath the idyllic surface...
...far removed from the children's world, turmoil.
DANGER JEWS
Their landlord turned out to be a Nazi party member.
And in March 1931, they moved.
The bank owned by the family also had serious problems...
...resulting in its complete collapse in 1933...
...caused by Otto's brother being the victim of a fraud...
...and the effects of the Depression, particularly acute in Germany.
And, of course, the threat of the gathering storm.
On the streets...
...at the rallies...
ONE RACE ONE NATION
...and finally in January 1933...
...the ballot box.
ONE LEADER
For it is often forgotten that Hitler gained power in a democratic election.
For the Franks, the German dream was over.
Some of the family had moved to Switzerland.
Otto chose to try his luck in Holland...
...where he had prior business connections.
In autumn 1933, the family settled here in Merwedeplein...
...a modern housing development in South Amsterdam.
They established a settled and full existence amongst German refugees...
...and Dutch neighbors.
We moved into the same neighborhood as the Frank family.
Many other refugees moved there.
And so there was a little bit of a German-Jewish enclave...
...by no means a ghetto, but just a little enclave.
Quite often parents would speak
German in the street...
...which annoyed us children terribly, of course.
Hanneli Goslar
My father was a deputy minister in the interior.
And he was the chief of the press in Germany.
He had really a very high position.
And he immediately fled...
...when the whole government stepped down.
And, okay, we went to England before...
...but he didn't find a job where he didn't have to work Shabbat.
And so we stopped here in Merwedeplein.
Life for Jewish refugees...
...as I experienced it as a young child, in a way had its charms.
What I particularly enjoyed was that we adapted faster than our parents.
Our parents had to turn to us and ask us...
...what's done in this country.
And I found this tremendously democratizing.
I really enjoyed that part very much.
The Franks formed an active social life amongst the other refugee families.
For visitors, Anne's behavior made the Sunday gatherings...
...something of an ordeal.
She was just what you could call naughty.
She had to sit on a table where everything was very beautiful...
...in a beautiful dress and have her chocolate not spoil it.
Isa Baschwitz
She just didn't want to.
She got up and she made fuss, and she...
...drew attention.
And then she grew angry.
And that angriness...
...that was the problem between the parents.
Mother Frank said, "You sit down. "
And Father Frank said:
"Leave the child alone.
She's so small and she's so little. "
So she was allowed to do the things she wanted.
And that happened every time.
Every time that girl was naughty...
...was impertinent, later on, really impertinent.
I remember very strongly that Mr. Frank...
...was seen as an ideal daddy, that he was the daddy...
...because he was so much involved in his girls' education.
He fixed his wife breakfast on Sunday morning and brought it to her bedside...
...which was unheard of in our circles.
So that news made the round:
"Mr. Frank does this for his wife!
How great. "
Otto Frank interviewed in 1979
We left Germany in 1933...
...because I didn't want to educate my children with blinkers.
They were not allowed to see
Christian friends anymore.
In Holland, it was different.
Upon her arrival in Amsterdam...
...the 4-year-old Anne was sent to the Montessori school...
...where Lies Goslar became her best friend.
Years later, in her diary,
Anne wrote this of Lies:
"Hanneli Goslar, or Lies, as she's called at school, is a bit strange.
She's usually shy...
...outspoken at home but reserved around other people.
She blabs whatever you tell her to her mother.
But she says what she thinks.
And lately, I've come to appreciate her a great deal. "
Anne and Lies' friendship had begun on their very first day at school.
Exactly in opposite of the door...
...I saw the back of Anne, and she was ringing these little bells.
And she turned around, and she saw me,
I saw her, and hop...
...we run each into the arms of another.
I think my mother went away.
I didn't look at her anymore.
And this was the first day.
Since then we were together really till the end.
Of the two sisters, I was really more impressed with Margot than with Anne...
...for rather obvious reasons.
Margot was a year and a half older than I am, so she was a model.
She was ladylike.
She was always composed.
She always did her homework.
She was just the ideal young lady.
I was a tomboy, so I always thought it would be great to be like Margot.
Anne was very lively, and I didn't need any model for that.
I was lively myself.
Besides, she was younger. You never model yourself after a younger child.
So I know her-
All the time.
I could do that just as well.
I will start with the sentence my mother said always.
My mother said, "God knows everything.
Anne knows everything better. "
This describes Anne, you understand?
I don't know in English...
She knew everything better.
Anne was- In America you say "spicy. "
A spicy girl.
She always was friendly with the boys.
The boys liked her.
The girls liked her. She also always was in the center of the thing.
Then she had something I never saw, not before and not afterwards.
She could take out the socket out of the shoulder...
...and she would sit, and everybody looked.
And then she made out, and knock, knock, knock.
You have to be very careful. You can end up with an orthopedic doctor.
She liked it, and everybody was looking at her. And then she was happy.
When he came to Holland, Otto Frank set up the Opekta Company...
...a Dutch subsidiary of a German concern, selling pectin...
...a substance used in making jam.
The progressive Otto had a film produced to promote the product.
In the early days, he had four key colleagues, all non-Jews.
One of those employees was an Austrian who'd grown up in Holland.
Miep Gies.
It was a very fine place to work...
...because we understand all the people in the office.
We were very close, was friendly together.
He was always our boss...
...but also our father.
We can go to Mr. Frank with all our troubles and sorrow.
The office boy and general helper from 1933 until 1939...
...was Henk van Beersekamp.
Mrs. Frank was different from Otto Frank.
Otto Frank was a familiar, friendly man...
...who treated me as an equal...
...and with kindness.
Mrs. Frank was a bit...
...well, maybe she had been accustomed...
...to better things in life in Germany.
I don't know.
Margot was a bit subdued...
...but Anne was a dear.
I had lots of fun with her...
...because we would make funny faces...
...which she found amusing.
I remember one time I did this:
And she always split her sides with laughter.
And when I did that, her tongue...
...would move to and fro.
But it was fun.
She was a great girl.
Dutch Nazis putting on a show in Amsterdam in 1938.
Though Hitler had infiltrated the police, the civil service...
...even the prime minister...
...in the years before the war, Holland...
...was generally good to its Jewish refugees from Germany.
Despite these scenes of Fascist collaborators...
...the Dutch and German Jews believed that they would be safe in Holland...
...far from the Führer in their former homeland.
Few, very few, tried to leave for safer shores.
And Otto and his family were not amongst them.
Sometimes I said to Mr. Frank:
"You must go out of the Netherlands.
It will be danger for you. "
Miep Gies
"No," said he.
"In the first World War, the German came not here in the Netherlands.
So they come the second time, also not. "
And I said to him,
"You must go to America. "
"No, I stay here because I love the Netherlands. "
The faith of Otto Frank and thousands like him...
...was catastrophically misplaced.
By May 1940, Hitler had conquered almost all of Europe.
Austria, Poland, Norway, Denmark...
...Yugoslavia, Greece,
Romania, Bulgaria...
...and most of France had fallen to
Germany's air force and storm troops.
Europe's low countries remained as a tantalizing morsel...
...to be swallowed whole.
Then by the 14th of May, 1940, it was all over.
Five days after the Germans had finally...
...smashed through Holland's borders, the Dutch capitulated.
In Amsterdam, Hitler's victory was greeted with black humor.
My father made himself look like Hitler.
It was wonderful how he did it.
Here was the hair and the black mustache.
The Franks lived next door, and he would ring at the door and come in.
I remember them all, you know, the first moment.
They were very frightened what happened.
If you could think Hitler didn't come to their house.
But it was very funny how everybody was frightened at the moment...
...till they...
...till they saw who it was and what happened.
What happened to your father?
He died in Bergen-Belsen.
The German vice tightened gradually.
First they conducted a hearts-and-minds campaign to win over the Dutch...
...their Aryan brothers.
THANK ADOLF HITLER
JEWISH QUARTER
For the Jews, it was another story...
...as their freedom was gradually restricted...
...by a never-ending series of anti-Jewish decrees...
...already familiar in Germany and other conquered territories.
JEWS PROHIBlTED
By 1942...
...no area of Jewish life was excluded from German control.
Jews Prohibited
By Law
Everything that was fun in life was forbidden.
We were not allowed to go anymore to a park or to a swimming pool.
We were not allowed to go to shops.
Only to Jewish shops and only between 3 and 5.
8:00 in the evening you had to be at home.
You had to wear the star.
You had to have something with you that would look if you are Jewish or not...
...even if you had the star.
Then things were-
You were frightened.
You just wouldn't go out.
To school and home, and that's it, yes.
How one of the friends of Anne said:
"Everything I did, I was afraid it is forbidden. "
Well, the effect of these restrictions...
...was, I think, mainly...
...because it came inch by inch, very slowly.
"If that's all, we can bear it. "
We always had a stiff upper lip, and we tried to make the best of it.
If you can't go to public school anymore...
...there are good Jewish teachers.
If you can't go to concerts, which was important in my family...
...there are fine Jewish musicians, so we make music at home.
So we always tried to put the best spin...
...on whatever happened.
And that way, I think, we tried to ward off...
...thinking about how we were being more restricted...
...and what was going to be sure to come afterwards.
Otto Frank, always the perfect father...
...rented movies to show the girls on the living room wall.
Rin Tin Tin was a particular favorite with Anne.
She and her friend Jacqueline van
Maarsen created a cinema of their own.
Together we made little cards to get in.
Of course, everybody could come in, but we wanted to make it look real...
...by making these little tickets.
"Jacqueline van Maarsen...
...is invited on Sunday, the 1st of March...
...with Anne Frank, Merwedeplein 37...
...for...
...a movie.
Without this card, no entrance.
Please inform in time. Row 2.
Seat 2."
THE LIGHTHOUSE BY THE SEA
WITH RIN TIN TIN
This film supplied the entertainment for Anne and her friends...
...when they celebrated her 13th birthday...
...her last in freedom.
Her prized gift that 13th birthday...
...on Friday, the 12th of June, 1942...
...was her diary...
...a present she had bought with her father a few days before.
From the beginning, Anne addressed her diary as a special friend...
...with whom she would conduct a secret correspondence.
Her first entry was this:
"I hope I will be able to confide everything to you...
...as I have never been able to confide in anyone.
And I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support. "
Her early diary jottings were typical of a 13-year-old:
Gossip about school friends, jokes...
...and a record of her unextraordinary daily life...
...together with photos and other scraps.
In the years that followed, she also shared her most intimate secrets...
...including her increasing interest in the development of her body and in sex.
What interested Anne very much was sexual behavior...
...and she wanted to know what it was all about.
Jacqueline "Jopie" van Maarsen
And she asked her father about it.
I knew much more than she did...
...because I had my sister, who told me everything.
So I thought, "Well, I'm not going to enlighten you altogether.
You just ask your father. "
At the time, Anne's body was not changing yet.
And I think that she was curious...
...because she had some little...
She used a bra from Margot with cotton wool in it...
...to show a bit of breast.
And I did not need that kind of thing...
...and she was interested to see exactly...
While Anne was innocently absorbed with her developing body...
...Otto Frank was mindful that if the Nazi measures against Jews...
...continued to their inevitable conclusion...
...he and his family would need to take precautions to protect themselves.
For a year, he had been secretly preparing a hiding place for them all...
...together with his German business associate Hermann van Pels...
...van Pels' wife, Auguste, and son, Peter.
It was to be in several rooms behind the company offices on Prinsengracht...
...in central Amsterdam.
Laboriously, and unknown to all but the innermost circle...
...Otto accumulated furniture, cooking implements...
...bedding and clothes.
At the Frank home, two and a half miles away in Merwedeplein...
...Sunday, the 5th of July, 1942, was the day that everyone had dreaded...
...had hoped against hope would never come.
That Sunday, the Germans delivered...
...this innocuous document by registered mail...
...to several thousand Jews, the majority of them of German extraction...
...aged between 15 and 40.
They were to report within 9 days to be transported to a labor camp...
...in Germany.
Margot Frank was one of them...
...throwing her family, like so many, into crisis.
The agonies at that moment were when you had some youngsters saying:
"Labor won't floor me. I'm strong.
I can do whatever's asked of me.
I'm going and that's it. "
And the parents would say, "No, stay.
It's going to be the end of your life. "
So you saw the family in tension.
Then you had other families where a youngster would say:
"I don't want to go. I'm scared. What will happen?" The parents would say:
"You must go. Remember, grandmother lives with us and the baby.
If you don't go, we'll be punished. "
And you saw the families really...
...torn asunder by these events.
And that was terrible.
Nine years after fleeing Germany, the Franks were on the run again.
By 7:30 on Monday, the 6th of July, 1942...
...the whole family had disappeared...
...leaving behind an elaborate false trail...
...indicating they had fled to Switzerland.
We came here...
...and the kitchen was not...
The kitchen was just left like it was...
...with everything dirty in the sink.
I went into her room, and I saw her bed not made.
And the shoes that she loved, she'd just received them for the summer...
...were near the bed.
I came here, you see.
I went up, and I am ringing and ringing and ringing...
...and nobody opens.
And at the end somebody opened.
It was a tenant. Mr. Goudschmidt.
He had the room at the roof in the Frank apartment.
He looked at me as if he'd never seen me before.
And I didn't know what happened.
He said, "What do you want?"
"I come to play as usual. " And he said:
"Yes, but don't you know? The Frank family left for Switzerland. "
Miep Gies had been given the responsibility of getting Margot...
...who was now in flight from the Germans, to the hiding place.
I took Margot by bicycle.
Monday morning, very raining.
And that was good for us because the German...
...came not on street.
And I came with her to the Prinsengracht 263...
...go up with her.
She was very...
-Upset?
-Yes. She was very upset.
I saw it.
And when I was standing with her in front of the hiding place...
...I was afraid that she would...
...fall down.
And what could I do with her?
I opened the door and put her in.
Despite Otto's carefully laid plans...
...on their first day there, the family was surrounded by chaos.
When I come there, it was terrible.
Nothing was okay.
And Mrs. Frank and Margot were sitting down on the bed.
They could not do anything.
There was...
They couldn't accept this situation.
But Anne and Mr. Frank were busy, very busy.
I ask Mrs. Frank,
"Can I do something for you?"
"No," said Mrs. Frank.
"For today, I have all the things. "
And then I went down.
But the next day, when I came, all was okay.
-So Anne and Mr. Frank-?
-Were busy the whole day.
Was this typical of the family?
Yes. That was typical for the family.
Now the family was dependent on Otto Frank's four employees...
...who had volunteered to help them survive.
Johannes Kleiman and Viktor Kugler supplied Anne and Margot...
...with school books and other reading matter...
...at the same time, ensuring the Opekta
Company continued to function...
...even producing record profits that could be used to keep everyone alive.
Miep Gies and her assistant, the 23-year-old typist, Bep Voskuijl...
...had the dangerous task of supplying the residents of the annex with food...
...purchased on the black market or with forged or stolen ration books.
In one of her first diary entries in hiding...
...Anne described her new home to her imaginary friend:
"Thursday, July 9, 1942.
Dear Kitty:
Our secret annex is at the back of the building.
There's just one small step in front of the door, and then you're inside.
Straight ahead of you is a steep flight of stairs.
To the left is a narrow hallway opening onto a room...
...that serves as the Frank family's living room and bedroom.
Next door is a smaller room:
The bedroom and study of the two young ladies of the family.
To the right of the stairs is a windowless washroom with a sink.
The door in the corner leads to the toilet...
...and another one to Margot's and my room.
If you go up the stairs and open the door at the top...
...you're surprised to see such a light and spacious room...
...in an old canal house like this.
It contains a stove and a sink.
This will be the kitchen and bedroom for Mr. and Mrs. van Pels...
...as well as the general living room, dining room and study for us all.
A tiny side room is to be
Peter van Pels' bedroom.
Then just as in the front part of the building...
...there's an attic and a loft. "
As they settled into their confinement, the chimes of the Westerkerk clock...
...seemed to act as a constant reminder of the world they had left behind them.
Before long, the entrance to the hiding place was disguised...
...as a bookcase.
But in every respect, what lay behind those innocuous files...
...was untypical of the shelter provided to other Jews.
It was relatively spacious, within a city.
There were people outside dedicated to helping and protecting them.
Most families were torn apart...
...but here, all four of the Franks could stay together.
A week later, they were joined by their friends the van Pelses.
Miep Gies visited each day.
When I came here from this door...
...in the middle was standing the table with the chairs.
All the people, seven people...
...were standing in the line here.
Did not say any word.
Did not say any word...
...but waited for me to begin.
It was always an awful moment for me...
...because I felt the dependence...
...from these people of us, the helpers.
Except Anne. Anne was in the front.
She asked, "Hello, Miep, what is the news?"
In those early months,
Anne was desperately lonely...
...and always hoping for news of her friends.
She even invented a correspondence with one of them.
"September 25, 1942.
Dear Jacqueline:
I'm writing this letter in order to bid you goodbye.
I can't write to everyone, and that's why I'm just writing to you.
I'd be grateful if you'd be really nice...
...and keep up a secret correspondence with me.
All inquiries to Mrs. Gies.
I hope we'll meet again soon...
...but it probably won't be before the end of the war.
Well, then, Jackie,
I hope things go well with you...
...and that I hear from you soon.
Your best friend, Anne.
P. S.:
I hope that we'll always stay best friends until we meet again.
Bye. "
I think that she wrote it immediately...
...after she went into hiding.
And afterwards, at that moment in September, she wrote it down.
She invented in that my answer to her.
And then she wrote a second letter...
...in answer to this invented letter.
And she must have been very lonely that she invented these letters.
Anne also wrote a long fantasy in which she imagined living with her cousin...
...in the safety of Switzerland.
When I think that when Anne wrote about Switzerland and about me...
Bernd Elias
...it must have been a painful thought to her...
...to realize that she was like a bird in a cage...
...and we, over here in Switzerland...
...were free to do anything we wanted to do.
And all her dreams...
...were caged in.
And we, the boys, her cousins...
...could fulfill everything she was dreaming of.
It must have been a very, very hard thing for her.
In the diary, she even designs a skating dress...
-... so she can be your skating partner.
-Yes.
Yes, when I saw that the first time...
...it really overwhelmed me.
It made me cry, to be very honest.
Especially then that I knew she was not alive anymore when I saw it.
I would have loved to go skating with her.
Anne also addressed her diary entries to a circle of imaginary friends...
...all characters from a well-known series of books for adolescent girls.
Eventually, she settled on one friend, Kitty...
...as her diary correspondent.
Anne was always a very curious child.
When I was upstairs and went away...
...she'd always wait till the last to speak with me.
And then she had me.
And she asked everything what happened outside.
And I told her the truth.
The terrible truth.
"November 19, 1942.
Dearest Kitty:
Countless friends and acquaintances have been taken off to a dreadful fate.
Night after night, green and gray military vehicles...
...cruise the streets.
In the evenings, when it's dark...
...I often see long lines of good, innocent people...
...accompanied by crying children, walking on and on.
No one is spared.
The sick, the elderly, children...
...babies and pregnant women all are marched to their death.
I get frightened when I think of close friends who are now at the mercy...
...of the cruelest monsters to stalk the earth.
And all because they're Jews. "
Bloeme Evers-Emden
Margot's classmate
At the beginning of the class of '41, we had about 50 children.
The deportations began in July '42.
And then from 50 children...
...all the time, children disappeared.
When you came in your class, you said:
"That child's missing and that one and that one. "
You did hope they were ill.
But you knew that they were round up...
...or maybe they were hidden.
At the end of the school year...
...in April '43...
...there were three children left...
...two boys and I.
And we did our final examination...
...together.
The second part of the final examination, I was alone.
It was very sad.
Very difficult.
From 50 children, one remained at the end of the year?
While the roundups of their friends continued outside...
...in their hiding place,
Anne and the others...
...tried to establish a kind of normality.
"Dear Kitty:
Up to now, our bedroom with its blank walls was very bare.
Thanks to Father, who brought my entire...
...post card and movie star collection here beforehand...
...and to a brush and a pot of glue...
...I was able to plaster the walls with pictures. "
We were both collecting pictures...
...from the children of the queen.
Here you see Elizabeth, today Queen Elizabeth...
...and her sister Margaret.
And I also was collecting, and we would change together.
We had from Belgium...
From all the queens in the world, we would change pictures.
I liked it very much. Anne was also collecting from film stars.
This I wasn't interested in at all.
I only remember she had
Deanna Durbin. This one.
This is the only one I remember from then. I never saw a film.
I don't remember if Anne saw films.
We went to see Shirley Temple films.
And here in Amsterdam, we had a cinema, Cineac.
There you could see one hour a little film and news.
And then it started.
Over there, we would go very often.
Four months after going into hiding, an 8th person joined the annex...
...a 54-year-old German dentist,
Fritz Pfeffer.
Margot slept on a folding bed with her parents.
And Anne had to share her room with the newcomer.
Look, Mr. Pfeffer was my dentist.
And Mr. Pfeffer asked me always:
"Miep, do you have a place for me?"
Then I went next day...
...in the hiding place and tell it to Mr. Frank and the other peoples.
They listened to me.
Next day, Mr. Frank said:
"Miep, where seven people can eat...
...can eight also eat. "
Pfeffer moved into Anne's bedroom...
...complete with his drill and dental implements.
While no one would now lack treatment of their cavities...
...relations between the 54-year-old disciplinarian...
...and the free spirit in her early teens...
...were inevitably stormy.
On this corner...
...it was the desk...
...for Anne...
...and Pfeffer.
There this...
This gave sometimes troubles with Anne.
Anne was standing on her rights.
From so till so is her time.
But I believe Mr. Pfeffer...
...did not see the importance of a diary...
...for a little child.
"Him and his lies.
I'll smack his ugly mug so hard, he'll go bouncing off the wall.
Anyone who is so petty and pedantic at the age of 54 was born that way...
...and is never going to change. "
What Anne never knew was that Fritz Pfeffer had a son...
...whom he had raised as a single parent in Germany...
...until sending him to England after Kristallnacht in 1938.
A few weeks later, Pfeffer himself fled to Amsterdam...
...with his fiancee, Charlotte.
But his 11-year-old son never saw his father again.
Peter Pepper
Fritz Pfeffer's son
We're talking about a girl under very difficult circumstances...
...who first of all decided that my father was not a nice man.
Therefore, she called him Dr. Dussel, which in English is "idiot. "
As far as my point of view...
...retrospectively to the age of 11 and below...
...there's a very large inaccuracy.
First of all, my father, although being a very strict man...
...was a very kind man.
What other people don't recognize...
...is his love of life, his love of freedom.
My father was a sportsman.
He loved to row.
He loved to ride horses.
He liked to climb mountains.
So if you take a man who's always been active all his life...
...and then in flight he ends up here...
...it's like caging a bird.
Weekly, Mrs. Miep Gies would bring a package containing letters...
...and other personal messages from Charlotte Karletta.
And weekly, she would take a letter from him to her.
What do you feel now about what that may have meant for your father?
What it meant for my father...
...is that it is a thin lifeline.
A thin lifeline that was the only hope of expression...
...and relationship.
Because with Charlotte's letters to him...
...expressing her love, her feelings...
...her news, whatever it was in those letters...
...is the only thing where my father would have...
...the semblance of mental health.
Because you're a prisoner of your own mind.
For the first time, Fritz Pfeffer's son meets his father's protector.
Mr. Pfeffer.
How do you do?
Fine.
I was a very good friend of your father.
Do you understand German?
I came into contact with him every day.
He was my dentist, exceptionally good.
He asked me if I could help him...
...find a place, and so I helped him.
Unbelievable.
Nice to meet you.
He was a lovely, lovely man.
Do you speak English?
Very bad.
Shall we try German?
Yes, if that's okay, it would be better.
What would you like to know?
I just want to say...
...two words.
Many thanks.
Two months after this meeting,
Peter Pepper died of cancer.
If Anne reserved her special venom for Fritz Pfeffer...
...with the claustrophobia of the months in hiding that turned into years...
...all the adults at one time or another were subjected to the fury of her pen.
"September 27, 1942.
Some people, like the van Pelses, take delight not only...
...in raising their own children...
...but in helping others raise theirs.
Margot doesn't need it since she is naturally good...
...kind and clever, perfection itself.
But I seem to have enough mischief for the two of us.
More than once, the air's been filled with the van Pels' admonitions...
...and my saucy replies.
They tell me I should talk less, mind my own business and be more modest.
But I seem doomed to failure. "
Otto, the ever-indulgent father, was frequently called in...
...to act as a peacemaker between Anne and the others.
Her adoration of him was matched only by her increasing problems...
...with her mother.
"I cling to Father because my contempt of Mother is growing daily.
And it is only through him that I'm able to retain...
...the last ounce of family feeling I have left.
I don't know how I should act.
I can't very well confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm...
...and her hard-heartedness.
Yet I can't continue to take the blame for everything.
I'm the opposite of Mother, so of course we clash.
She's not a mother to me.
I have to mother myself.
I'm charting my own course and will see where it leads me. "
Mrs. Frank was the most depressed of all the people.
Sometimes when I go out of the hiding place...
...the staircase downstairs...
...she went with me till the door.
I did not understand that.
What did she want of me?
And once again, I go with her in her sleeping room...
...and she closed the door, and then she said to me:
"Miep...
...I am so afraid. "
She told me all her troubles.
But what could I do?
I didn't say anything...
...because I was in the same position as she.
While Anne and her mother feuded...
...in the second year, she developed a strong passion for Peter van Pels...
...the 17-year-old boy with whom she shared her caged existence.
They spent hours together in the loft chatting...
...or simply staring out the window at the chestnut tree.
"Sunday, March 19, 1944.
I have the feeling that Peter and I share a secret.
When he looks at me with those eyes, with that smile and with that wink...
...it's as if a light goes on inside me.
I hope things stay like this...
...and we'll have many, many more happy hours together.
Your grateful and happy Anne. "
Peter van Pels was a blue-eyed boy...
...with very little intellectual capacity.
I didn't know him nearly as well as I knew Anne.
But he once came to our house when we were reading the classics...
...and he was so singularly bewildered by it...
...that I remember thinking:
"My goodness, he doesn't know a thing!"
The relationship with Peter waxed and then waned.
They cuddled and kissed, but as she noted in her diary...
...Anne gradually became dissatisfied...
...with his inability to express his feelings.
The pressures of confinement created and then crushed...
...their adolescent love affair.
In the secret annex, the claustrophobia was stifling.
The radio, broadcasting from England...
...was an essential lifeline to news from the outside world.
Every Allied victory brought hope, every defeat, gloom.
Arguments over food blew up into major rows.
And then always the ever-present threat of discovery.
The windows had to be covered by blinds, even in the heat of summer.
The toilet could only be used outside office hours.
No one could walk in shoes on the lower floor...
...for fear that the workers in the warehouse below would hear.
And always the question,
"Would they be betrayed...
...or would they betray themselves by some inadvertent error?"
To add to everyone's fears...
...the warehouse and offices under their hiding place were burgled a few times.
My father had the maintenance of the building, the daily maintenance.
Hans Wijnberg
Later I recognized that he must have been the carpenter...
...that's repairing the door...
...which is opened by the burglary in the book, in Anne Frank's diary.
I think there were two burglaries, weren't there?
Yeah. The other one was me.
What were you after?
I think it's a mixture of adventure and spices.
We found some spices.
But we had to move out...
...because we recognized people living in the house...
...because they made a mistake upstairs.
That's what I later realized.
I didn't know it was the Frank family.
We did not know.
We were not supposed to know who was living in a house...
...because of what I explained earlier.
You didn't speak about people living somewhere.
So we heard them flushing the toilet...
...so we moved out because that was a sign people were upstairs.
And well, we were not there with an agreement of anybody.
"Wednesday, March 29, 1944.
Dearest Kitty:
Mr. Bolkestein, the cabinet minister...
...speaking on the Dutch broadcast from London...
...said that after the war, a collection would be made of diaries and letters...
...dealing with the war.
Of course, everyone pounced on my diary.
Imagine how interesting it would be if I published a novel...
...about the secret annex.
The title alone would make people think it was a detective story.
Seriously though,
10 years after the war...
...people would find it very amusing to read how we lived...
...what we ate and what we talked about as Jews in hiding. "
For 6 weeks, Anne thought constantly about the message from London.
Then she made up her mind.
She had wanted to be a journalist, a famous writer, to travel the world...
...see Paris and Hollywood.
This was her opportunity.
Starting in the middle of May 1944...
...she began to furiously rewrite her whole diary from the first entry...
...with a view to future publication...
...at the same time as keeping up her regular diary entries.
"Tuesday, June 6, 1944.
Dearest Kitty:
'This is D-day, ' the BBC announced at 12.
'This is the day.
The invasion has begun. '
A huge commotion in the annex.
Is this really the beginning of the long-awaited liberation?
The liberation we've all talked so much about...
...which still seems too good, too much of a fairy tale ever to come true?
Will this year, 1944, bring us victory?
We don't know yet.
But where there's hope, there's life.
It fills us with fresh courage and makes us strong again.
The best part of the invasion...
...is that I have the feeling that friends are on the way.
Those terrible Germans have oppressed and threatened us for so long...
...that the thought of friends and salvation...
...means everything to us.
Maybe, Margot says...
...I can even go back to school...
...in October or September. "
With the Allies advancing, the spirits in the annex soared.
Otto Frank kept a map...
...tracking every advance of the British and American troops.
But the odds were stacked against those in the hiding place.
Of the 25,000 Jews who hid from the Nazis in Holland during WWII...
...some 8 to 9 thousand were discovered by the Germans...
...or betrayed by their Dutch hosts.
Many of the Franks' neighbors, some of whom were known Nazi sympathizers...
...knew there was something going on in the back house...
...at 263 Prinsengracht.
Anyone could've called the authorities to collect the reward...
...for betraying Jews in hiding.
Anne herself chronicled many acts of carelessness...
...that could've led to the suspicion that could easily lead on to betrayal.
It has never been proved how they were betrayed...
...but on a sunny summer morning in 1944...
...two years after they first stepped behind their secret door...
...their world collapsed.
It was the 4th of August...
You know, it was always my task to go first...
...up in the hiding place.
Also this day.
I go up, took my shopping list...
...talked with the people...
...and came down.
After an hour, I was working in the office.
Bep in front of me,
Koophuis on this side.
The door...
...goes open, but I did not look.
And it was quiet.
In a moment, I look up...
...and there was a man standing before me with a gun to me...
...and said:
"Quiet. No words. "
Was there ever a plan...
...for this sort of situation?
No. No.
We were so...
...sure that it never would happen.
The authorities were alerted by an anonymous phone call...
...that there were Jews hiding in the Opekta offices.
Four Dutch policemen from the German security service...
...led by an Austrian officer, went straight to the secret bookcase.
I could hear the voice of the Nazi.
And I heard this man...
...speak with a...
...with a Vienna accent.
And if you know, I'm born in Vienna.
I know that accent.
I stand up and say to him...
...in a nearly friendly mien:
"You are a Vienna.
I'm a Vienna too. "
And this one sentence...
...was perhaps too much for this man.
He was standing there...
...looked at me.
And when he come to him-
He come to me...
...so near to me that I feel his...
...his adem.
His breath, I feel his breath.
"Aren't you ashamed of yourself...
...helping Jewish baggage?
You deserve to receive...
...the worst punishment.
And you know what that is. "
I did not say any word.
I was...
He was going in my office from the one wall to the other...
...as a wild...
...animal.
Animal.
After a while, he stood still...
...looked me a little friendlier.
"Out of personal sympathy, you may stay...
...but woe betide you if you flee.
Then we'll take your husband. "
When the Germans captured
Jews in hiding...
...they looted everything of value.
Officially, this was meant to finance the transportation of the Jews...
...to the Polish death camps.
But corruption was rife...
...and Jewish valuables often lined the pockets of Nazi policemen.
Needing a container for his loot...
...the Austrian arresting officer, SS
Oberscharführer Karl Silberbauer...
...emptied the contents of Otto
Frank's briefcase onto the floor.
And thus, he left behind
Anne's diary.
After the Franks and the other peoples were away...
...I come here in...
...and found...
...the diary scattered on the floor.
Ellie and me, Bep and me.
Bep and me, we saw this.
"That is the diary of Anne!"
"Please take! Take it!"
We took all the things...
...but I was afraid...
...that I had not all the paper of the diary. I knew that.
But I was so in hurry...
...because I was afraid that this Austrian man came again.
-That the officer-
-That the officer...
Because he say,
"I come back. "
Within two weeks of Miep Gies saving Anne's diary...
...the Dutch firm of A-Puls stripped the hiding place of its possessions...
...to be sent to Germany to aid bombed-out German civilians.
Silberbauer and his assistants had taken the eight Jewish prisoners...
...to Gestapo headquarters, housed here in a former school in Amsterdam.
Of the helpers, Johannes Kleiman and Viktor Kugler were also arrested.
Though not the two women,
Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl.
Kleiman and Kugler were then sent here...
...to Amersfoort labor camp in Holland...
...shown in this film during a Dutch Red Cross inspection.
Kleiman was released in September due to bad health...
...and Kugler managed to escape in 1945...
...when the train in which he...
...was being transported to Germany was bombed by American planes.
The day after the arrest of the Franks, the van Pelses and Pfeffer...
...Miep tried one last desperate effort to help them.
I go to the Gestapo.
And when you dare go in...
...you did not know if you come out.
I found this Austrian man...
...and he said, "Yes, come. "
I went to him.
But when I came there, his office was full of young people.
Secretaries and all the peoples.
But he was sitting in the corner.
And when I came in, I could not-
I think...
..."I cannot speak with this man what I want. "
So I go to the corner to him...
...over his desk, and I did so:
"Understand me," I said to him.
"Please come back tomorrow.
I can't do anything more for you today. "
And then I went away.
Next morning, I go to him.
He was standing in the door...
...waiting for me.
"I am sorry," he said to me.
"I can't do anything for you...
...because I am not high enough.
You understand me?"
And I said to him,
"I don't believe you. "
"Go to my boss. "
And I go upstairs.
I knocked on the door.
Nobody said anything.
Then I opened the door, and what did I see?
A large table...
...sitting high German people.
Their caps on the table, and in the middle...
...the radio, listening to England.
That was very, very-
Was not allowed for the German people.
And it was very dangerous for me...
...because I saw what they did.
And I said, "Who is he, the boss?"
One man came to me, pushed me out of the door.
"You are a swine. "
And then I went down.
And this Vienna man was standing in the door.
I said, "What did I say to you?"
And then I went down...
...and I feel...
...the curtain of this play was fallen for me.
Afterfour days in the cellars of the Gestapo building...
...the prisoners were taken to the Amsterdam railway depot.
They were loaded under guard onto an ordinary passenger train.
Janny Brilleslijper, a member of the Dutch Resistance...
...was amongst the prisoners.
What I saw was a family.
There were a number of people...
...a very worried father and a nervous mother...
...and two children...
...wearing sports clothes, I believe.
Of course, it is more than fifty years ago.
They had sports clothes on...
...and backpacks with them...
...and the four of them...
...stayed together constantly.
They spoke very softly to one another...
...and there were other people there.
It was a beautiful day...
...the sun shone to greet you...
...the houses of the city were bathed in gold...
...and those people all had a sort of...
...silent melancholy about them.
Nobody said anything.
I cannot say that the people were afraid.
We went to meet the unknown.
We didn't know what was waiting for us.
This was the first destination for the Franks and the other prisoners.
Westerbork Transit Camp in northern Holland.
This film was made by the commandant...
...to show his superiors in Berlin how successful he was...
...in keeping his prisoners occupied...
...before sending them on to less benign places in Poland or Germany.
104,000 people were processed through here...
...between 1942 and 1945...
...more than 75% of the Jews in Holland...
...before the outbreak of war.
Proudly, and without irony, the commandant showed...
...the humiliation of his prisoners...
...who were largely ignorant of the fate that awaited them.
Of the 60,000 or so who were sent to Auschwitz from here...
...only 673 were ever to return.
And of the 34,313 transported to Sobibor death camp...
...just 19 came back.
In the meantime, Westerbork offered ball games and calisthenics.
The Jews were encouraged to entertain themselves with a weekly cabaret.
Three survivors of that time in August 1944...
...returned for the first time in 50 years.
All, like the Franks, had been captured in hiding.
It is maybe unbelievable...
...but when we were arrested and brought to the prison...
Sal de Liema
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
...I cannot say it was a kind of relief. No.
But there was something that we said:
"Now this is maybe the end of the war. "
Because we knew the invasion was going on...
...and, "The end is finally in sight.
What we have to do now is try to survive this. "
It was overwhelming.
I knew it was Westerbork.
Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder
Westerbork Prisoner June/Sept 1944
I thought, "This is the end," because
I knew what happened in Germany.
And I knew that they were going to kill us.
We never gave up hope that we would survive the war.
Rose de Liema
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
There was not that much
Gestapo supervision in the camps.
The first ones I saw were the Franks.
I knew Margot rather well...
Bloeme Evers-Emden
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
...and I knew Anne.
We said to each other,
"You too, here? You too?
Were you hidden? What happened?"
But very soon you were taken inside the camp...
...and you had to be registered...
...and you got your wooden shoes...
...because we were punished, because we were hidden.
For me, it was the best time of the war.
No hunger, nice boys.
Frieda Menco
Westerbork Prisoner July/Sept 1944
We worked during the daytime.
Wasn't bad.
Then we got food...
...and we were standing around and making jokes with each other.
Like other prisoners, the eight...
...were given make-work jobs by their captors.
The Franks had the task of breaking up old batteries for recycling.
Otto Frank wanted something better for his Anne.
I was cleaning a table...
...and then at once, somebody came to me...
...with a girl-
That was Otto Frank.
Later on, I knew it.
He was with Anne, and he asked me:
"Here's Anne, my daughter.
Do you have work for her?"
Because he wanted, of course, her to be inside with us.
Then she said to me, "I can help you.
I'm very handy. I can do everything. "
This was the end, actually.
This was it.
It all started here.
My grandparents...
...all my uncles, my aunts, my nieces, my nephews...
...all my friends.
They came here, and it was the beginning of the end.
And I really...
...feel like this is...
...a big cemetery.
In the end, you start to believe that it won't happen.
You know that there are transports going each Tuesday.
But when two months have passed...
...and your own name wasn't on the list, you start to believe:
"We can stay here until the end of the war. "
Because by then of course, we knew that there would be an end.
Although it was incredible, but we knew...
...that the English and the Americans were already in Europe.
And then it came, and you became very factual.
You took your things, everything-
You got back what belonged to you...
...because they had taken that away from you...
...because they gave you that outfit.
It was like what happened so many times later. It was like having-
I don't know how you call it. You don't quite realize what's going on...
...and what will happen with you and to you.
Eighty-three trains left Westerbork during the second World War...
...for the Polish death camps of Auschwitz and Sobibor.
On September 3, 1944, they loaded many of the Jews in Westerbork...
...onto the very last transport to Auschwitz.
1019 men, women and children...
...amongst them, the group of eight from the secret annex.
For most, it was to be their last sight of Holland.
Darkness...
...is the first thing I think about.
Being cramped in.
Too many people.
No room enough.
Luggage.
No possibility to lie.
Sitting for three days.
Now and then standing.
You were like in a trance.
You didn't realize.
You realized that very bad things were to happen...
...and to be completely powerless.
Sometimes we stood up. We got up...
...and looked through cracks...
...when we were at a station when the train stopped.
Because we still had no idea how we went and where it would end...
...and how long it would take.
People cried, and on the other side, they told stories to each other...
...to try to sleep, to sleep standing.
There was not enough food and drink.
We were, I think, about 40 or 50 people...
...in that cattle car.
We were standing.
Sometimes we got to our knees to rest a little bit.
Urinating and other things.
I don't remember what we did, but there was nothing there, nothing.
I think we just let it go.
And it was like an endless journey.
And even that was better than that there would have come an end to it.
Because the end was not good.
That, we felt.
Your imagination stops...
...at certain moments.
You refuse to imagine the worst.
On September 5, the train from
Holland reached its final destination:
Auschwitz death camp in southwest Poland.
All those lamps.
Terrible, terrible hard.
The color was so terrible.
It was yellowish.
And we came there, men, women, children alike...
...on the platform here.
Don't know where exactly.
Yeah, I see there, the rail.
We were astonished.
I really thought I passed away, and this was hell.
Really, I thought, "I'm already dead. "
We were driven one way or another way.
After all, was the one way to the death...
...and this was to a kind of life.
I remember very well too...
...that you were naked before men...
...and I was educated chastely...
...in the values of my people.
And I got a shock.
I knew that from this moment on...
...all your norms and values...
...were of no importance anymore.
And that there was a quite new...
...set of values to be learned.
And if you didn't learn it, you would be dead.
I remember that I realized it in one second.
And I was only 18 years old.
According to Auschwitz records, more than half the people on that train...
...were gassed on the day after their arrival, September 6.
549 Jews, among them...
...every child under the age of 15.
They told us right away what was waiting for us: death.
"All of your people, they're going to the chimneys. Maybe tonight already. "
It was just a death factory.
We knew.
We saw that terrible pipe...
...burning day and night.
The smell. I thought that when it should come here...
...that I should have had a penetrant smell. But no.
I was sure that I should smell it because sometimes I smell it.
The smell of the disinfection, the smell of the burning flesh...
...and the smoke.
Anne, Margot and Edith Frank, and Mrs. van Pels...
...were among the 212 women from the Dutch train...
...who were granted entry into that hell they called Auschwitz-Birkenau.
They were placed in Women's Block 29.
It was no life.
It was no life at all.
We were degraded...
...to even less than beasts.
Less than animals.
We were standing outside, and I saw a wagon on the first day.
"What's he throwing on there?"
Dead bodies. Oh, my God!
I could hardly look.
The next couple of days later, I saw it.
"Oh, there's that wagon again who picks up the dead bodies. "
The next time, I didn't pay any attention to that wagon.
So your brain starts functioning differently...
...because if you didn't-
You didn't do it on purpose...
...but then you couldn't go on living.
In Auschwitz-Birkenau, Edith Frank and her daughters...
...were drawn together as never before.
A very important survival...
...for all the people in concentration camps...
...were the forming of groups.
Support groups.
And of course, as mother and children and daughters...
...you were a natural support group.
And I think everything from the past was faded away...
...against this scene of Auschwitz.
It was of no importance anymore, I suppose.
Was there any sign of the previous antagonism...
...between Anne and her mother?
I think it was all forgotten.
They were always together.
You can have the luxury...
...of a struggle with your mother in normal circumstances.
These circumstances were so...
...bad. Not only bad...
...but like a ghost writing...
...that everything fell away.
I'm quite sure about that.
The last time I saw Anne and Margot and Mrs. Frank...
...was when there had been a selection...
...for a working camp.
But you never knew for what the selection was.
But Anne and her mother were told...
...that Anne was not allowed to go with our group...
...because she had scabies.
Her mother and Margot decided to stay with Anne.
We went to a labor camp where we...
...didn't get food and worked hard...
...but most of us survived.
There were few deaths, and there were no gas chambers.
Had she not had the scabies...
...and had they gone with our transport...
...they had had a better chance to survive.
So because Anne suffered from scabies...
...and her mother and sister stayed with her...
...they lost their chance to leave
Auschwitz for the work camp...
...where many of the Dutch women saw out the remainder of the war.
As for the men, when they had first arrived at Auschwitz, September 5...
...Otto Frank, Hermann and
Peter van Pels, and Fritz Pfeffer...
...together with the other 254 males who had not immediately been gassed...
...had been separated from their women and taken to the nearby Auschwitz I.
This, the original death camp created from an old Polish army barracks...
...may have been smaller than
Auschwitz-Birkenau...
...where the women had remained within sight of the gas chambers...
...and three crematoria, but life here for the men was no easier.
Mr. van Pels was the first to wither.
We told him, "Don't give up. "
He did, and it was just like he melted away. It was two weeks-
Two days, he was gone.
He gave up.
That was it.
No one knows exactly when they took
Hermann van Pels to the gas chamber...
...but it was only a few weeks after his arrival at Auschwitz.
Otto Frank and Sal de Liema resolved...
...to keep up their morale by whatever means.
People around us...
...like we all were, of course very nervous.
Talking about food all the time.
Talking about clothes...
...that we didn't have any, practically no clothes.
Only the striped clothes that we had.
The food was just a piece of bread that they'd give you. It was really bad.
So Mr. Frank and I-
We knew each other from Westerbork.
He said, "We should get away from those people...
...because if you start talking about food and everything...
...your brain is gonna go. "
And we said, "We understand that physically...
...we maybe will not survive this. "
We should try to...
...survive mentally...
...and talk about things that had nothing to do with the camp, like:
"Do you remember the melody from the 9th Symphony from Beethoven?"
And then we start singing to each other...
...just to get away from this fear.
Just to get our brain...
...thinking about other things.
We talked about van Gogh, Rembrandt.
"Ever go to the Van Gogh Museum?
Ever go to the Rijk Museum?"
And all those things, just not to-
To get out of our minds.
To get out of this here.
And it really helped, I think.
He was older, much older than I was.
He said, "You know, why don't you call me Papa Frank...
...because I have to have something in my life...
...that I can be a papa to. "
I didn't know what he was talking about.
I said, "What do you mean?
I have a father...
...and he is hidden in the Netherlands, in Holland.
If you do it for me, you don't have to, because I have already a father...
...and he's alive.
I know he's hidden. "
"No," he said, "you do it for me.
I'm the type of a man, I need this.
I need somebody to be a papa for. "
So I told him, "If it will help you, I'll do that. "
He said, "Call me Papa Frank. " Until he died, when he wrote his letters...
...he always signed his letters,
"Papa Frank. "
I was standing one time in the snow...
...naked...
...after we came back from our work.
We stand appell here, outside here...
...and a German soldier came...
...and he had his fur coat on and he looked at me and said:
"Cold, huh? It is cold?"
I didn't even answer.
I just looked at him.
And he said, "You know you will not survive this, you know that.
But in case you will survive-
But I'll take care of it that it's not gonna happen.
Nobody, but nobody will believe you...
...what we did to you people. Nobody. "
Otto Frank interviewed in 1979
One day in Auschwitz,
I was very depressed.
I had been beaten the day before...
...and that had really affected me...
...also in terms of my morale.
It was a Sunday morning...
...and I said, "I can't get up. "
And then my comrades...
...all Dutchmen of course...
...because I was the only German...
...among Dutchmen...
...but I was totally accepted by the others...
...they said to me,
"That's not possible...
...you must get up, otherwise you are lost. "
And then they went to a Dutch doctor...
...who worked with a German doctor...
...and this Dutch doctor...
...came to me in my barracks.
He said, "Get up and come...
...tomorrow morning to the sick barracks...
...and I'll speak to the German doctor...
...so that you will be accepted. "
And that is what happened...
...and through that I was saved.
While Otto languished in a sick barracks...
...his daughters were transported away.
On October 28, 1944, they were separated from their mother...
...and together with 1308 other women, they were sent here...
...to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.
Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder was with them.
You see with your own eyes how beautiful it is. It is beautiful.
And there were birds here.
And I wanted to be a bird.
Freedom, freedom, freedom.
I thought, "Oh, how nice to be a bird.
You can fly wherever you go. "
I was simply jealous of birds.
When Anne, Margot, Rachel and the others arrived at Bergen-Belsen...
...the camp was overflowing...
...with new inmates brought from throughout Europe.
The barracks being built to accommodate them were not ready...
...and they were crammed into the makeshift shelter of tents.
On November 7, a violent storm raged through the camp...
...destroying many of these.
Seeking shelter from the rain...
...Anne and Margot encountered
Lientje and Janny Brilleslijper...
...the two Dutch sisters whom they knew from Auschwitz and Westerbork.
It stormed, it hailed.
We had walked four kilometers...
...and we sat together...
...the two of us...
...with only our two little faces...
...sticking out of two blankets.
Those dark horse blankets...
...with our heads together...
...and only our two little faces...
...like two heaps on a little hill...
...up against a tree...
...to stay as dry as possible.
And four legs came walking up...
...also with blankets around them...
...and over their heads.
And at the same time as we saw them...
...we all threw off our blankets with a shout...
"Oh, how wonderful that you are here. "
How can you find something wonderful...
...in the middle of a concentration camp?
Deliberately starved, frozen and racked with disease...
...Bergen-Belsen was no place to be in those last months of World War II.
A wooden barracks was found for the unfortunate women from Auschwitz.
But Anne and Margot Frank came to be in the worst position of all:
In the lower bunk next to the door.
Incapable of protecting themselves...
...from the vicious wind that swept through Bergen-Belsen's barren acres.
They shouted, "Close the door!
Close the door!
It is cold! It is cold!
It is cold!"
And it was terrible for them, of course.
What did the Frank girls look like when you saw them in the barracks?
Very terrible. Terrible. Sick.
Thin. No hair.
Their eyes, very big. Very big eyes because they were so thin.
Almost impossible to imagine...
...but there was a time when the name Bergen-Belsen...
...brought hope to the eyes of Jews due to be transported here.
In the early years, the Nazis planned it as a camp for Jews...
...who might be used for exchange for German prisoners of war.
In those long ago days, Anne's friend
Lies Goslar had been sent here...
...with her sister and father, the former
German government minister.
In 1945, Lies discovered she was in the compound...
...next to the Dutch women from Auschwitz.
One day, a friend of mine tells me:
"You know, between all these women, there is your friend, Anne Frank. "
I don't know, I felt very crazy...
...because I was thinking the whole time:
"Anne is safe in Switzerland. "
I was sure of this. This was what the tenant said to me.
And so I had no choice to go also near this barbed wire.
This was not allowed, and the German in the watchtower was watching us.
And you know he would have shot if he would have caught us.
So we couldn't see. I told you there were barbed wire with straw...
...and we couldn't see the other side.
So I just went near at dark...
...and I start to call,
"Hello? Hello?" Something like this.
And who answered me was Mrs. van Pels.
Maybe the Dutch women went near the barbed wire...
...because the others didn't know anybody. I don't know.
I didn't even ask her, "How are you?"
I knew her, but not very good.
But immediately she said to me,
"You want Anne?" And I said, "Yes. "
And she says, "You know,
I will call her for you.
Margot I can't call for you.
She's very sick already.
But Anne I will call for you. "
And so I was standing there in the cold, and I was waiting.
And then suddenly, I heard somebody calling me...
...and it was Anne.
And this was awful.
The first thing, we both started to cry. Then I said:
"What are you doing here?
You are in Switzerland. "
And she answered me, "We wanted this rumor to go around...
...because we hoped then the Germans will not look after us. "
And then she said she had nobody anymore.
And this was not right, and I am so very sorry because she said:
"My mother is dead. " And her mother really was dead at that moment...
...but she couldn't know. She was sure her mother was killed when she left.
But her mother came out later, was not killed...
...she just died of exhaustion in the beginning of January.
Her sister, she knew, was very, very sick already.
But now her father.
Look, if it was Mengele or somebody else...
...they wouldn't know how old you are.
They would see only naked bodies.
And Mr. Frank was 55 years old...
...but he was only one month in the Dutch camp...
...so he looked still very good.
And the Germans just looked and saw somebody that still can walk...
...so they sent him to the right, to live.
But Anne thought they go by the age, and she was sure of it.
"My father is dead. He is an old man. "
And I always think, if she had known her father is still alive-
After her sister died, she just was without any hope.
Then maybe she had-
You know, it was only...
...one month she died before the liberation.
But she didn't know, and so she had really nothing to live for.
At this time, as a special prisoner being kept for possible exchange...
...Lies Goslar received a parcel from the Red Cross.
My friends, everybody gave me a glove or a little sock and a little bread.
So I came back at night with such a small package.
And then I hear her again, and we were speaking.
I told her about my little sister.
I told her my mother wasn't alive anymore. She didn't know.
Miep only told her that my-
That the baby died.
And my father was then already in hospital.
He died 25 of February, and this was before.
And I throw the package over...
...and then I heard her crying or shouting.
And I couldn't understand.
"What happened?"
"The lady next to me caught the package, and she run away with it. "
And she didn't give her anything.
I said, "I will try for another time. "
And really, I tried another time.
And this time she caught the package.
And it was the last time I saw her.
More than 50,000 of Bergen-Belsen's inmates died in 1945...
...as disease and starvation ravaged the camp.
Typhus, carried by lice, was a particularly horrible killer.
It is terrible when you are covered in lice.
Anne had thrown away her clothes...
...and she came to us crying...
...wrapped only in her gray blanket.
Lientje (my sister) lay sick...
...and I couldn't do anything...
...except give Anne some clothes to wear...
...and give her some delousing material.
And I promised to come to her the next day...
...to come to both of them...
...because she said,
"You have to come.
Margot is so ill. "
At that time...
...Margot was already mortally sick.
I suppose she also had typhus.
I'm not sure.
But the next day,
I couldn't get away...
...and it took at least four or five days...
...before I went to her...
...and then they were already dead.
Both dead.
And all of a sudden...
...I didn't see them anymore.
But you would not pay attention.
The place was empty.
We were sick.
And when I was ill, to speak about myself...
...is why I couldn't pay more attention than I did.
They're not there anymore.
They are dead.
That was that.
Outside in the entry guard...
...all of them were swept away.
Boom. They are outside.
I don't know whether I can talk about it.
Meat was traded...
...bodies.
It's very difficult...
Leave it.
I can't say any more.
The bodies from our barracks...
...we almost couldn't lift them anymore.
They were thrown onto a pile...
...between the barracks...
...and inscribed on my eyes...
...are these people...
...in every possible position...
...in every possible form...
...covered in snow...
...completely naked...
...because they would always be undressed.
On a pile with wide open eyes.
We tried to close as many eyes as possible.
It didn't always work.
Bergen-Belsen, as filmed by British liberators:
A place where humanity had been reduced to the worst indignities.
Cannibalism became part of a desperate struggle...
...to quench the most appalling hunger.
Only a few hundred yards away...
...the Germans kept supplies of food and medicine...
...while their prisoners died by the tens of thousands.
In November 1943, a year and a half before her death...
...in the safety of her
Amsterdam hiding place...
...Anne Frank had a nightmare in which
Hanneli Goslar appeared before her.
Hanneli Goslar in a concentration camp.
"I saw her there, dressed in rags...
...her face thin and worn.
She looked at me with such sadness and reproach in her enormous eyes...
...that I could read the message in them:
'Oh, Anne, why have you deserted me?
Help me, help me.
Rescue me from this hell. '
And I can't help her.
I can only stand by and watch...
...while other people suffer and die.
All I can do is pray to God to bring her back to us.
If only I could help her.
Dear God, I have everything
I could wish for...
...while fate has her in its deadly clutches.
Hanneli, Hanneli. If only
I could take you away.
If only I could share everything I have with you.
It's too late, but I'll never forget her again...
...and I'll always pray for her.
Yours, Anne. "
She didn't do so much wrong, you know, if you are in this age.
But this is one of the reasons that I tell the story now...
...because it is the other way around.
Yes, today I am standing here, and she is dead.
And so I am quite obliged to tell about her.
And she wanted to be so very famous.
I can't help a lot of this but a little bit.
I think, "What a waste, such a young life should end...
...and without any reason. "
She could really have given something to the world.
The whole thing is crazy.
My father died there one week after I saw her.
I don't know.
I cannot judge this whole period.
Nobody can understand it, I think.
I don't know.
Auschwitz had been liberated two and a half months before Bergen-Belsen.
On a freezing January 27, 1945...
...a Ukrainian division of the Soviet army, accompanied by a film crew...
...arrived at the site of the most successful mass murder...
...in mankind's history.
The last SS guards had already fled...
...leaving behind only those too young or infirm...
...to be led away on the now-notorious death marches.
The gassings at Auschwitz had already stopped the previous November.
The gas chambers dynamited.
But in a wild attempt to cover their tracks...
...the SS dragged thousands away with them in desperate flight...
...in the biting cold.
Those of the prisoners who could not keep up...
...were shot at the side of the road by their German escort.
Tens of thousands perished
"somewhere in Europe" of hunger...
...thirst or exhaustion, or from an SS bullet.
Fritz Pfeffer had been amongst those taken away before the Russians came...
...to die on December 20, 1944...
...in Neuengamme concentration camp in Germany.
Anne's boyfriend from the days in the annex, Peter van Pels...
...was marched out of Auschwitz by the Germans on January 16...
...and taken to Mauthausen death camp in Austria...
...where he died on May 5, 1945...
...just three days before the Americans liberated that camp.
His mother, Auguste van Pels, was sent on a crazy journey...
...across Germany and Czechoslovakia.
First to Bergen-Belsen, then to Theresienstadt.
And in the last days of the Reich...
...to an unknown camp, where she too died.
One of the millions of anonymous bodies left...
...by Hitler's failed vision of a thousand-year empire.
Otto Frank, weighing less than 115 pounds...
...was amongst the lucky few that the Russians found alive in Auschwitz.
When he was recovered, Otto wrote to his mother in Switzerland...
...where she had lived since before the war.
His letters then remained forgotten...
...in the attic of her home in Basle for nearly 50 years...
...until they were discovered by his nephew in May 1994.
"Auschwitz, 23 February 1945.
Dearest Mother: Hopefully these lines will reach you...
...bringing you and all my loved ones the news...
...that I have been liberated by the Russians...
...that I am healthy and in good spirits...
...and that I am being well taken care of.
I do not know where Edith and the children are.
We have been separated since September 5, 1944.
I just hope to see them back in good health.
I'm longing to see you all again and hope that this will be possible soon.
All my love, greetings and kisses.
Your son, Otto. "
So it was that Otto Frank, the only survivor...
...of the eight who had been in hiding in Amsterdam...
...took the long journey back to his Dutch adopted homeland.
By May, with the war in Europe ended...
...his Russian liberators had sent him...
...to the Black Sea port of Odessa.
There, he was placed on a New Zealand merchant ship...
...bound for France.
"May 26, 1945.
The steamer Monowai.
Dearest Mother and all you loved ones:
Tomorrow we arrive in Marseilles, and this letter can hopefully be mailed.
I imagine I will be able to telegraph you...
...so that you will get the news of my return in good health.
All my hope is the children.
I cling to the conviction that they are alive...
...and that we will be together again.
Unfortunately, Edith did not survive.
She died on January 6, 1945...
...in the hospital, of starvation.
Her body could not withstand attack of influenza.
The closer we get to home, the more impatient we get...
...to hear news of our loved ones.
What happened in all these years!
We own nothing anymore.
We won't find a pin when we get back.
Bernd Elias
Otto Frank's nephew
The Germans stole everything.
No photograph, letter or document will remain there.
Financially, we had no worries during the last years.
I earned good money and saved.
Now all is gone.
But I don't worry about this.
We have gone through too much to worry about things like that.
Only the children.
The children are what count.
I hope to get news from you straightaway.
Maybe you already have news of the girls.
I cannot write about everything that I am thinking of.
I have to stay in Holland as...
...with the exception of a tattooed number on my arm...
...I have no papers and therefore must think of seeing you later.
The main thing is that we have contact.
We hope to see each other soon.
With innermost greetings and kisses and love, your Otto. "
My husband worked on the station...
Miep Gies
...registering all the people who are coming down from...
...the concentration camps.
And he ask everyone:
"Have you seen Mr. Frank?
Have you heard about Mr. Frank?"
And one day, one evening, he came home and he said:
"I have good news for you.
Otto Frank is coming home. "
And when he said this, we lived downstairs.
Mr. Frank came...
...along the window.
I ran to the door.
At first what I ask was:
"Where's Edith?"
Otto Frank said to me,
"Edith never come...
...but I have hope for the children. "
And he came to us.
Because he had no house, no nothing...
...he lived seven years in our house.
But the life go on.
We go every day...
...to the office.
But I do not give him the diary of Anne Frank.
You may not know this...
...but when he was on the ship...
...from Odessa to Marseilles...
...Otto wrote a letter to his mother.
In that letter he said this:
"Kugler and Kleiman, and especially Miep...
...her husband and Bep Voskuijl cared for us for two years...
...with everything we needed...
...in spite of the dangers...
...and unprecedented sacrifices they made.
One cannot describe it.
I will never be able to repay what all these people have done. "
I never know about this. No.
That is the first time...
...I heard it. Thank you.
While Miep kept the diary secret from
Otto in case Anne should return...
...he was desperate to find his daughters.
He advertised in newspapers and visited the Dutch Red Cross...
...asking, always asking for news of Anne and Margot.
At the end of July, he was told that someone knew of their fate.
In August, he had the tragic news confirmed.
He stood on the porch and rang the bell...
...and remained standing on the porch.
He said, "Are you Janny Brandes?"
And I said, "Yes. "
"Can I come in?"
Because he was a very polite gentleman.
He came into the hallway...
...and remained standing there and said:
"What happened to my daughters?
I am Otto. "
I could hardly speak...
...because it was very difficult...
...to tell someone...
...that his children were not alive anymore.
I said, "They are no more. "
He turned deathly pale...
...and slumped down into a chair.
I just put my arm around him.
When the girls' death had been confirmed...
...Miep gave up the secret she kept hidden from Otto...
...since the day of the family's capture more than a year before.
From her top drawer, she handed him...
...three books and a sheaf of loose papers:
Anne's diary, which she herself had never read.
I took the diary...
...out of my desk...
...and gave him it with the words:
"That is a testament for your daughter Anne. "
Can you look?
Can you see how this man looked at me?
Lost his wife.
Lost his two children.
He had the diary.
Otto transcribed sections of the diary for his mother in Switzerland.
He also started showing it to friends...
...seeking their views on what to do with his daughter's unique legacy.
They all advised him to have it published...
...but his efforts met with no success.
Then this article, written by a friend of a friend...
...appeared in an Amsterdam paper in April 1946...
...and finally, a publisher stepped forward.
Het Achterhuis, "The Back House, " appeared in June 1947.
Initially, it made little impact.
Then in the 1950s...
...German, French, English and other translations began to appear.
In 1955, a stage adaptation opened on
Broadway to a rapturous reception.
The transformation of the 15-year-old
German-Jewish refugee...
...into an emblem of the Holocaust gathered pace.
A 1959 feature film based on the play added further to this process.
To some, she had become little short of a saint.
But her diary, at the very least, had become a publishing phenomenon.
In 1953, Otto had remarried and moved to Switzerland.
In the absence of Anne, he became the focus for his daughter's celebrity.
He, in turn, came to symbolize the perfect father so many children crave.
Thousands wrote to him from around the world...
...and he replied to each individually.
If young people are writing to me after reading the diary...
Otto Frank interviewed in 1976
...I start to think:
"That is, for me, one of the most precious. "
Though Otto developed relationships, sometimes close ones...
...with many of the children who wrote to him...
...he admitted he never understood his own daughter in her lifetime.
Was she in fact the optimist and cheerful person that he saw as a child?
She showed herself like that.
But in fact, I only learned to know her really...
...through her diary.
Throughout these years, one persistent problem refused to go away:
Citing differences between different language versions of the diary...
...which were never explained in the various editions...
...together with further fictional scenes in the play and film...
...neo-Nazis around the world...
...wanting to throw doubt on the very existence of the Holocaust...
...alleged that the diary was a hoax.
Painful and inconclusive lawsuits followed...
...but it was only in 1980, after Otto's death...
...that the authenticity of the diary was finally tested scientifically.
The extensive report by the Netherlands
State Institute for War Documentation...
...took five years to complete and was eventually published...
...with a study of all the versions of Anne's diary.
It categorically stated that the diary was genuine in every respect.
In 1960, one of Holland's most secret places became one of its most public.
The Franks' annex was opened as a museum...
...and is now visited by over
600,000 tourists a year.
Otto also created charitable foundations...
...to perpetuate Anne's message to the world.
Anne was not simply to be commemorated...
...but her short life was to become a more general force for good.
To fight against prejudice and discrimination...
...and hatred against people of different race and religion.
Since 1985, a touring exhibition...
...telling Anne's life story and its relevance to current world affairs...
...has traveled from country to country, from Moscow to Minneapolis...
...South America to South Africa.
It has also shown that the diary has had some surprising readers...
...in surprising places.
During the many years my comrades and I spent in prison...
Nelson Mandela
President of South Africa
Political Prisoner 1964-1990
...we derived inspiration from the courage and tenacity...
...of those who challenge injustice...
...even under the most difficult circumstances.
Some of us read Anne Frank's diary on Robben Island...
...and derived much encouragement from it.
It's very interesting...
...the letters of the German children.
They always ask me everything...
...because they wrote me:
"My father or grandfather...
...didn't tell me anything about the war.
They say always, 'That is the past.
That is over. "'
But that is not true.
The past goes always with you...
...in your whole life, and we can learn from the past.
In 1941, there was a wedding at Merwedeplein in Amsterdam.
After filming the street...
...the cameraman pointed at the onlookers above.
There at the window was Anne Frank.
This is the only known moving footage of her.
When she stood at the window that sunny day in June...
...it's not surprising that the 12-year-old Anne Frank...
...was yet to find her life's purpose.
But less than three years later, as she sat caged...
...in the fragile security of her hiding place...
...she had discovered her destiny.
"Wednesday, April 5, 1944.
My dearest Kitty:
I don't want to have lived in vain like most people.
I want to be useful or bring enjoyment to people...
...even those I've never met.
I want to go on living, even after my death.
And that's why I'm grateful to God for having given me this gift...
...which I can use to develop and to express...
...all that's inside me.
Yours, Anne M. Frank. "

And no. We're still doing V/Qs because they keep promising us a better scanner.
What kind of bedside manner is that?
The idiot has had an MI after stenting, he stands out in the rain for eight hours.
- I don't think yelling's gonna help.
- It might.
You know, you might want to think about getting out of the ER.
That advice is only about nine years too late, but thank you.
Seriously. You never talked to patients like that.
I've had an epiphany.
Dr. Greene.
Medevac coming in. Diverting from Children's. Near-drowning.
- Did he arrest?
- I don't know.
He must be pretty sick if they're flying him in the rain.
- It's supposed to be a surprise.
- I hate chocolate mint.
- Yeah, I didn't pick it.
- You think I should stick around?
- They're going to gather everyone soon.
- Hey, you're not supposed to see that.
I'll be upstairs. Page me if anyone needs me for anything.
- I'm sure that we will.
- Carter, isn't it? John Carter?
- And you would be?
- The girl by the pool.
Oh, right, yeah. The one without the answering machine.
It broke in the move.
I haven't had time to go shopping.
- That's convenient.
- Hey, I called you.
- Did not.
- I spoke to your manservant, Harry.
Henry? The night butler?
He didn't say anything about it.
It is the 21 st century.
You can get voicemail.
- You need to get better help.
- You volunteering?
- Any benefits?
- Well, there's the outfit.
- Dream on.
- Hey, Carter.
- Hey, how'd it go?
- He did good.
Couple pounds of stool.
Only gagged once.
Yeah, those old ladies can surprise you, huh?
- Yeah. How do I know when I'm done?
- You develop a feel for it.
- Where's the stab wound?
- Should be here by now.
Call Dispatch. Make sure it's rolling up.
Gallant, you're with me.
Don't worry about it.
It will only hurt for a day or two.
Do you think
I'm mean to the patients?
- Only the ones who deserve it.
- What about the ones who don't?
- You're nicer than I am.
- That's not much solace.
Sorry.
Oh, my God.
- I distinctly heard him.
- Who?
The weatherman this morning.
He said, "Party cloudy, chance of rain. "
Well, he warned you.
Twelve-year-old boy.
One-story fall and near-drowning.
Moderate respiratory distress, crackles on the right.
- What's his name?
- Daniel.
- Daniel, having trouble breathing?
- I let go of him.
- Who?
- Joey. I couldn't hold on.
His brother.
They were playing by the river.
- Where is Joey?
- Rescue's still looking for him.
All right, let's slide him out.
Here it comes.
Must be a police car.
- Does it usually take so long in the rain?
- Shouldn't.
- You need a jacket?
- No. We won't be out here long.
- I can go get one for you if you-
- I'm fine.
Sorry I haven't looked at your file.
You're military?
- Yes, ma'am. U.S. Army Reserve.
- ROTC?
No, I did a year of active duty.
Now I'm in a scholarship program.
So work in the ER might not be so crazy to you.
I think it's a whole different kind of crazy, ma'am.
- There you are. I was looking for you-
- No, listen, I need to see you.
I'm gonna pick up my son and drive to your office.
Well, if you're not there,
I'll get another attorney.
You're damn right I'm upset.
You told me not to-
You told me not to fight this thing. Now
Roger's gonna try to hang me with it.
- Fine. I'll see you in a half an hour.
- What happened?
The DNA analysis shows that I'm not Reece's biological father.
Oh, God, Peter. I'm so sorry.
I told myself a long time ago it wouldn't matter, that I'm his father.
- I won't let that son of a bitch change it.
- I'm going with you.
No. They're getting ready to throw a party for you.
I don't give a damn about a party.
Let's go.
- Frank, where the hell is this thing?
- What thing?
- Cleo, are you done?
- I'll call to say goodbye.
- Where's the stab wound?
- I don't know.
I was sloshing around downstairs.
I'm billing you for these shoes.
- Find out what happened.
- Dr. Weaver, it's here.
Twenty-four-year-old female pedestrian, hit by a car in a crosswalk.
- Miss, can you tell me your name?
- Jill. He hit my dog.
Probable LOC. GCS, 13.
BP,100/75. Pulse, 95.
- Where were you stabbed?
- What?
- No, she was hit by a car.
- Wait, where's the stab wound?
- What stab wound?
- Get her inside.
Your dispatch needs to get it together.
We didn't know you were coming.
The one we're waiting on is over half an hour late.
Dr. Weaver, Unit 37 got slammed by an SUV in a downed intersection.
- Ashville and Western.
- Who's 37?
- Our stab wound.
- Pickman.
- Rescue is trying to cut him out.
- Is she okay?
Don't know about the driver.
The pregnant woman is in bad shape.
- The stab wound's pregnant?
- And bleeding.
- Okay. Wait! I'm going with you!
- What, you're leaving?
She could be a dropsy. Have Carter take this case. I'll be right back.
- What do I do?
- Get in.
I couldn't hold him.
Daniel, I need to listen.
He's retracting.
ABG. He's decreased on the right.

Get on the radio and make sure.
Sucking chest wound.

Elastoplast, chest tube tray, and page Surgery.
Daniel, you got a hole in your chest sucking in air every time you breathe.
We need to plug it up, all right?
BP's 110/70. Still no sats.
- Ready?
- Yep.
- That should be better.
- They find Joey?
I don't know.
We're gonna ask the firemen.
- Please, they have to find my brother.
- Everything's gonna be okay. All right?
10 blade.
Stay close to me and watch where you're going.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Both airbags deployed...
- ... but he has a bad seat belt side.
- Sir, do you know where you are?
- The middle of the street.
- Lake had a flail chest. We moved him.
- Pickman's in back with an open tib-fib.
- She conscious?
Yeah, but her patient might be hemorrhaging.
Listen to his lungs on the way in.
You might need to needle him.
Okay, got it!
You okay, Doris?
I messed up my leg bad. It's open, but I got a pulse in the foot.
- I had to move it myself.
- I need you to stand back!
- I'm an emergency physician at County.
- Good for you.
Stand back! We need to open up this can. You help us.
What's the status of your patient?
A 28-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, mugging victim.
Son of a bitch!

You have vitals?

- Vicki.
Vicki, my name is Dr. Weaver.
Where are you having pain?
All over.
- Can you see the bone?
- Careful. Careful.
Does it feel like you're having contractions?
Brody!
No! Don't touch him!
Gallant!
Brody! Brody, are you okay?
He's unresponsive.
Get a monitor, and let's roll him.
Airway's patent.
Checking for a carotid.
He's not breathing. No pulse.
- You know CPR?
- Yes.
Start compressions.
- I'll do it!
- No! I need you to check on that woman.
- He's in my unit!
- Check on her!
Zadro, I need the defibrillator and an ambu-bag.
- Coming.
- Come on, breathe!
That was stupid. That was really stupid.
You could have both been electrocuted.
- Stop.
- Sorry. It was instinct.
I told you not to touch him.
You're okay if your feet don't touch the ground.
Guess what? It's raining.
Water conducts electricity.
- I'm all right.
- You were lucky.
- Still no pulse. Bag him.
- Got it.
- It's charging to 200.
- She's okay.
- Clear.
- The tires are insulating the rig.
I can't get in.
That hot wire keeps lighting it up.
- Is she conscious?
- Yeah. She's in labor.
You go back and tell her it's gonna be okay.
- He's one of my men!
- Do it.
Three hundred. Clear.
- He's venting.
- Got it.
- You got a rhythm?
- Yeah.

Hang in there.
We're gonna get you out of there.
Vicki, it's Dr. Weaver again.
Did you feel a shock?
- No, I don't think so.
- Is he breathing?
We got him back for now. Vicki, tell me if you're bleeding from your vagina.
The baby's not moving.
I need you to feel down there and tell me if you're bleeding.
Hold on! I'm coming in.
- No, no. I can't let you do that.
- Her baby's probably in distress.
First rule of an accident site, don't create more casualties.
Casualties?
We need an engineer out here. They're not showing fault in the power grid.
- It looks like a fault to me.
- That's what they're telling me.
- Hey, I told you not to do that!
- Just turn the damn power off!
Did you hit your head, lose consciousness?
I don't know. I remember walking in the street, seeing Gordon lying in the rain.
- Gordon?
- Her dog.
BP's 100/40.
He kept scratching at the door.
I had to take him for a walk.
- Breath sounds equal.
- No hemotympanum.
- But I wanna get a head CT.
- Is this the hit-and-run?
He didn't stop?
- Pulse ox is 94 on 4 liters.
- Miss...
- ... can you describe the car that hit you?
- It was silver, I think.
- Are you sure?
- No.
- Does that hurt?
- Yes.
- Did you take my dog to the vet?
- I'm afraid your dog died.
Full trauma panel, C-spine, chest, AP pelvis, Foley, give her 10 of morphine.
HemoCue's 9.8. Let's get an ultrasound before a CT.
- Dr. Greene is using it.
- Go see if he's done.
- What kind of dog was he?
- He was a terrier mix.
Those are the best kind.
You know, he probably went really fast.
Don't hear a dorsalis pedis pulse.
Go get me a Doppler.
Check an ICON before she goes to Radiology.
Little fluid in Morrison's pouch.
- Can we have that when you're done?
- It's all yours.
Page Pedes Surgery.
Another crit in 20 minutes.
- You want to cath urine?
- On a CPK and another portable chest.
Daniel, you're doing much better.
We need to keep an eye on you for the next couple hours...
...just in case you need any surgery.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- What?
Joey. He drowned.
- I don't know. They're looking for him.
- He didn't want to go.
- Where?
- To the river.
He was scared, but I called him a baby.
- You didn't know this would happen.
- He's only 6.
- Parents are on their way.
- They're gonna hate me now.
- They're gonna be happy you're safe.
- It should have been me.
- Watch the monitor. His heart's irritable.
- Looks like regular sinus rhythm.
- Okay, let's go! Shut the door.
- Okay.
Hey, stay clear of that rig!
- Hey, hold on.
- It's okay.
- Is she okay?
- Hypertonic contractions.
BP's dropping, 68/40.
That's way too low, right?
- What?!
- Nothing, Vicki.
I need you to be quiet.
I just need to listen.
- What was that?
- It's the power line!
- Fetal heart tones are 70.
- Is that bad?
Maybe the transformer will blow out and kill the line!
Dr. Weaver!
I need your help.
Can you get in here safely?
- Yeah, I'd have to jump.
- Okay, then jump.
Got it.
Search through the cabinets.
Find me an amp of cardiac lidocaine.
- Lidocaine?
- Just do it.
Vicki, your placenta is detaching.
It's bleeding into your uterus.
Oh, God!
Hey! I told you to stay away from the damn vehicle!
She's bleeding out!
Why is the power still on?
There's a crew on the way!
The only way to stop the bleeding is to deliver your baby surgically.
- It's too early.
- it's not. Thirty-six weeks is full-term.
Take me to the hospital!
Honey, I want to. I want to, but I can't right now, all right?
Shut it off from the plant!
It's supposed to burn through on its own.
They need to authorize the shutdown.
Vicki. Vicki, I need you to listen to me.
I'm an emergency physician.
I'm trained to perform a C-section only after the mother has died.
And in about 15 minutes, that's what's gonna happen.
Meanwhile, your baby is in danger.
But I might be able to save you both...
...if we take the baby now and stop your internal bleeding.
Are you willing to take that risk with me?
- I think so.
- You sure?
- You've observed a C-section?
- I haven't done OB before.
- Well, you'll be ahead of the curve.
- Lidocaine.
- Know how to take a blood pressure?
- Yeah.
Okay, take one. I need it every couple of minutes.
Squeeze that saline bag... and find me every 4-by-4 and bandage we have.
Okay, Vicki. Vicki, hang in there.
I'm gonna give you a shot in your spine that will numb your belly and legs.
All right, find me a 10 blade.
That's a scalpel.
When's the last time you've done this?
- Peter, the DNA test was inevitable.
- There has to be a precedent.
Not in a custody battle between two men without genetic ties to a child...
...they raised.
It's stepfather versus stepfather.
- I'm not his stepfather. I'm his father.
- Sorry. Father.
Until Carla died, Roger never questioned that Peter was Reece's dad.
- Irrelevant.
- She put my name on the birth certificate.
If she were alive,
Carla couldn't contest the paternity.
- But Roger can?
- Ironically, yes.
Peter, you are going to have to allow
Roger to resume partial visitation.
- No. No way.
- As we speak...
...Roger's attorney is drafting a pre-trial motion for visitation...
...until this is resolved.
You don't stipulate now, you'll lose that hearing and be painted as the heavy.
I'm the heavy? He's trying to take my son from me and I'm the heavy?
You need to be seen by the judge as someone who's interested...
- ... in Reece's well-being.
- I am.
Good. Then you need to listen to me.
You have to stay focused on the endgame.
And not let anger or fear impede that goal.
Vicki, stay awake.
I need you to stay awake.
- BP's dropping. 50.
- Spike another liter.
- "Spike"?
- Take the pointy end of the bag...
...and hang it up.
Hey, you! Firefighter!
- Lopez!
- Lopez, I need more light!
Scotty! Scotty, turn up the brights!
I need you over here. Get out.
- You're doing a vertical incision?
- Yeah.
Be ready with that hemostat.
We're gonna clamp the big bleeders and pack up everything else with gauze.
All right, here we go.
I need you to put your hands there and pull back.
- Where?
- Just do what I do from the other side.
Vicki, you feel that?
- Just some pulling.
- Okay.
Okay, fascia's exposed.
Okay, separate the rectus, down to the fascia.
All right, more retraction.
- Okay.
- Pull back.
- My baby.
- Hang on. Hang on, Vicki.
Okay. I'm into the peritoneal cavity.
Here's the uterus. Give me the scalpel.
You want me to let go?
- Scanner 1 will be ready in 10.
- Do a sound on the chest.
They're gonna take you upstairs and scan your whole body for other injuries.
I want you to tell the nurse if you need any more pain medication, okay?
I'm sorry about your dog.
What?
- "He probably went really fast. "
- She was upset.
She could have solid-organ rupture.
The dog's the least of her concerns.
It can be traumatic to lose a pet, especially if you saw it happen.
- What was his name?
- Who?
Your dog.
Happy. He was a Lhasa apso, and he got run over by a car when I was 11.
Oh, did he go really fast?
No. Crushed his pelvis.
- In the river earlier today...
- Someone drowned?
- Brother of the boy in Trauma 2.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Did they find him?
- Not yet.
- You can't leave anything around here.
- What?
- Some derelict stole my PalmPilot.
- Maybe you misplaced it.
- I had it two minutes ago.
- Dr. Carter.
- Alger. Alger, what are you-?
It's your grandmother. I found her in the driveway. I think she broke her hip.
Get a gurney!
There's a cut on her head.
- She was driving?
- She went during the break in the storm.
- Gamma?
- Oh, John, it's terrible. It hurts.
Okay, I know it does. Just lay still.
- Did she fall down?
- I don't know.
But the right leg is shortened and externally rotated.
- I think I broke my hip.
- I think you did too.
- What happened to your head?
- I thought it was best if I drove home.
I didn't realize how much
I was bleeding, so I slipped.
- You were in an accident?
- Well, I don't-
It was raining. I couldn't see.
I think I hit a dog.
- Where were you driving?
- It was supposed to be clear and sunny.
- Retract the bladder anteriorly.
- Like that?
More. Watch your fingers.
- I'm opening the lower uterine section.
- Is that the amniotic fluid?
Yeah. I'm in.
It looks like a lot of blood.
Auto recloser is stuck open or something. He's trying to bypass it.
- I don't care. Just shut it down!
- It ain't that simple, lady!
- Damn it!
- What?
I cut a uterine vein.
Another clamp now!
- BP's dropping. 60 systolic.
- Keep squeezing in that saline.
- Doesn't she need blood?
- I don't have any blood!
- Fundal pressure.
- What?
Push the baby down towards me from the top of the uterus.
- Okay. Right here?
- Yes. Yes. Now.
- Is the other ambulance here?
- It's pulling up.
Call County General. Say we need an
O.R., OB Attending, and a neonatologist.
- Grab the bulb syringe.
- Okay.
Suck out his nose and mouth.
- Is there an exit wound?
- Sure is. Blew off his boot.
A transthoracic current pathway.
- You saw it?
- He lit up like a Christmas tree.
I need the room.
Post-arrest electrocution.
- What's open with a monitor?
- He's a fireman.
Daniel, we're gonna shuffle you to another room.
CK is normal. Tox screen tested positive for marijuana.
- Marijuana? Were you smoking dope?
- C-spine, chest, pelvis.
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
For getting high and taking Joey out to the river?
- I didn't smoke today.
- I knew it. I knew it.
We saw the river on the news.
We wanted to see it.
- "We"? Joey's 6 years old.
- He said he wanted to see it.
- You're gonna blame it on him now?
- No, it's my fault.
- You're damn right it's your fault!
- Hold on.
I'm Dr. Greene. We need to get Daniel into a room.
Then I'll come out and brief you on your son's condition.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- You heard from the fire department...
- ... about Joey?
- Not yet. They're still searching.
- Between these clamps, right?
- Yes.
- Vicki! Vicki, are you still with me?
- Is that my baby?
Yes, honey. You have a boy.
He's crying. Do you hear that?
He's crying.
Could be stronger.
We need to get a heart rate.
Okay, 10 minutes!
They're gonna shut the entire grid off!
Why can't they do it right now?
They have to warn emergency facilities they're going off-line.
- Okay. It's 88, I think.
- You think or you know?
It's 88.
- One-minute Apgar is seven out of 10.
- It'll get better, right?
We need to wrap him up.
He needs fluids, oxygen, maybe blood.
You said we didn't have any blood.
You need to get him to the hospital.
Nine minutes!
Vicki?
Vicki, wake up!
Damn it! She's exsanguinating!
I have to clamp off the uterine artery.
Okay, I'm going!
Get out of the way!
- No!
- It's this or I throw him to you!
- No! No! Tell him to stop!
- Go.
- Is he okay?
- I got him.
- Okay, get him out of here. Go!
- Let's go. Let's go.
Transformer just blew.
Does that mean the circuit's dead?
I'm gonna sew this up.
You won't feel anything.
You okay?
I see a lot of fathers who come in here...
...and they're upset when their kids are hurt or missing.
Sometimes they say things they don't mean.
He's not my father. He's my stepfather.
Joey's the real kid.
- And that makes you...?
- A pain in the ass.
Did it come back?
- What?
- You were waiting for a chest x-ray.
Right. Lungs re-expanded.
Tube's in a good position.
I'm repairing the chest laceration now.
- Mom?
- So he's fine?
For now. He'll need to be monitored in the PICU.
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't have been out there.
- Yeah, I know.
- Mrs. Pendry-
Why did you take him there?
You didn't think. You never think.
I know. It should have been me that drowned.
- Yes. But it wasn't, was it?
- Mrs. Pendry-
- It was Joey.
- Mrs. Pendry...
...I need to talk to you outside.
In here.
What are you doing?
My son is missing. No one can find him.
Right. And your other son is in there who needs your comfort and love.
This is none of your business.
You want him to feel responsible?
Guess what? He already does.
You want him to hurt?
He already hurts.
You want him to hate himself, keep it up.
- They found him.
- What?
- He's stuck down river.
- Is he all right?
I don't know.
They're trying to get to him.
It'll be okay, Peter.
We don't know that.
I see you two together. I know.
What did you do that for?
You wanted to?
Are you expecting someone?
- Yeah?
- Peter.
No, Peter! This doesn't have to go any further, man!
Look, please.
Just hear me out, okay?
Come on.
Look, Reece lived under my care and my roof for most of his life.
All I'm asking for is some kind of arrangement that recognizes that.
- It's too late for that.
- Look, come on, brother.
- You want to put him through a trial?
- I'm keeping my son.
- I guess I'll see you there.
- Yeah, you will.
There's been a search going on ever since the boy's brother was pulled out...
...earlier this evening.
Swift Water 43.
County General waiting.
- Open, channel two.
- Copy that.
- Is he alive?
- They don't know.
Frank, call the burn unit. Brodoff is going to the O.R. for a fasciotomy first.
Is that your electrocution?
Compartmental pressure is almost 60.
Otherwise, he's lucky.
- Anyone want anything from the store?
- It's pouring outside.
Malik and Yosh don't like the lounge coffee. It hurts their stomach.

He's in arrest, but they're flying him in.
ETA,15 minutes.

- P.E.A.
Luka, our new med student's coming in BOA.
Weaver opened up a pregnant woman trapped in an ambulance.
- Opened up?
- C-section.
- In the field?
- She'll have some explaining to do.
- Can I get you something, Abby?
- Nope.
- Cigarettes?
- No, thanks.
- What's that?
- What?
- What time is it?
- Seven.
- What's wrong?
- Give me your bag!
- Let me see inside your bag.
- No!
What are you doing?
My PalmPilot alarm goes off at 7 to remind me to take my Vioxx.
- Come on, let go of her bag.
- After I see inside.
- Frank!
- For chrissakes.
Fabulous! First you steal it, then you break it!
- That's not yours.
- I'm calling the police.
Hey, hold on. This is a mistake.
Oh, yeah! Yeah, my stuff just leapt into her bag!
Nicole?
And it's not just me, pal, she's ripping off everybody. Ask Abby.
Nicole!
- I need some help here! Newborn!
- Luka, the baby.
Dr. Weaver says he might need a transfusion.
Is he premature?
No. We gave him O-2. He needs an IV.
Elevate her legs. Cycle the dynamap.
Tilt the monitor toward me. I got it.
- I said, I got it. How bad is that hand?
- It'll keep.
Sats are plummeting.
She's not moving air.
Stop! Airway blocked!
- I thought you had to move her!
- Need to protect her airway.
Cricoid pressure.
Cover!
Exposed flexor tendon.
You're gonna need a hand surgeon.
I need to control the scene.
Get somebody else.
All right, I'm in.
Bag her! Let's go!
Draw a milligram of epi and have atropine standing by.
- Get in!
- No, I'm good.
- No, you're not!
- Go on, get out of here. Come on.
People think kids don't listen to their parents, but they do.
If they tell you you're nothing, you think you're nothing.
- How cold do you think that water is?
- I don't know, 40.
Hope it's colder than that.
- You got a pulse?
- No. No pulse.
No spontaneous resps.
GCS, 3. For real.
- How long was he under?
- I don't know.
We found him in debris a mile from where he fell in.
- I thought it was P.E.A.
- No. Asystole the whole flight.
Hey, Gam.
Does it still hurt?
- On a scale of one to 10-
- It hurts, John.
- Did she get the full amount?
- In two doses.
- Give her four more of morphine.
- Okay.
But I'll put her on the monitor.
Well, Gam, you definitely broke your hip.
Looks like an impacted fracture of the femoral neck.
Please speak English, John.
I need to get a more sophisticated scan to determine if you need surgery or not.
I should have listened to you about the car. I'm sorry.
Gamma...
...I think you hit more than just a dog.
You also hit a young woman.
She's okay.
We're taking care of her here.
I called Mr. Stern in case you need an attorney.
- I hit a girl?
- Yeah.
- I left. I drove away.
- You didn't know.
But I should have checked to see.
Oh, my God!
Gam, you were confused, okay?
It's crazy out there. Visibility's terrible.
I'm gonna be right back, then I'll take you for that scan.
- What's wrong? What is it?
- Nothing. It's just another patient.
- Page Surgery. I need a HemoCue.
- What happened?
- Dropped her sats in the elevator. 88.
- Any chest pain?
No. Just passed out. BP's 80/60.
I can't see the cords.
I need a fiber-optic scope.
ABG, set up the ultrasound, and mix up 7500 units of heparin.
There's a lot of fluid in here.
Could be pulmonary edema.
Grab the thrombolytics box.
DIC panel. Troponin, CK, EKG...
- ... and a portable chest.
- Two large-bore IVs.
Nuke the saline in the microwave.
Get that collar off him.
- We'll need a bear-hugger.
- Coming.
- Tube's out.
- God, he's blue.
Number 51/2 uncuffed ET tube.
Suction.
Still no pulse.
Asystole on the monitor.
- Joey, wake up. Baby, wake up.
- Ma'am, you need to back up.
- Oh, my God!
- What is that?
- What is that?
- River water.
Cords are closed.
I need a fiber-optic laryngoscope.
Prep the neck.
I might have to crike him.
Daniel, get back to bed.
I'll come get you.
Can't get a line, and he's totally clamped down.
Two cutdown trays.
Daniel, now. Lily, can you...?
- You heard him, out! Get out of here!
- You too.
- What?
- Out!
Cross-match her for 6 units.
Two units FFP.
Stick her and send a clot.
- Is the O.R. ready?
- They're waiting for you.
- I have an emergency C-section.
- No kidding. I can see that.
Coburn called me, screaming.
I said she must have heard wrong.
28-year-old woman trapped in an ambulance, abrupted and hemorrhaging.
And ER docs don't perform C-sections until the mother arrests.
- She will if we don't get her upstairs.
- BP's up to 90.
Have dopamine standing by.
Add a coag panel.
I got it from here, Kerry.
Go back in the ER and stay dry.
I don't want you dying of pneumonia before your public flogging.
- I could've let everybody die.
- That's the safe play.
Now if she lives, you're a hero.
If she doesn't, I don't know you.
The baby.
Chuny, where's the baby?
He's pinking up.
They're waiting for the NICU fellow.
Nice save, Dr. Weaver.
One milligram of vitamin K, I.M.
Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment,
0.5 percent.
Good neuro check?
Moves all four symmetrically.
Lungs are clear. No retractions.
- You get a heel-stick?
- Glucose, 70. Pulse, 120.
You did it.
Okay.
CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine and a bilirubin.
Luka?
Can I talk to you?
- Bradying down to 60.
- Hurry up, she'll arrest.
I'm in, I think.
Sats are falling.
There's too much edema. Is Mark done yet? I need that fiber-optic.
- Air in the stomach.
- What are you doing?
Try to suction the cords.
Inflate the balloon.
- Keep it in, you'll have a better shot.
- No, just- Pull back really slowly.
There we go. Slowly, slowly.
Little more.
All right, there are the cords.
Give me the tube.
Open a crash cart. Draw one of atropine and an amp of epi.
Got it.
Come on, hold on.
Pulse ox is climbing.
Good breath sounds. Nice work.
Saline's running.
Dilute two mgs of atropine and one mg of epi down the tube.
How high does the temp go on that vent?
Forty centigrade.
Set tidal volume at 200 on 100 percent.
Still no pulse and no pressure.
All right, keep warming him.
We got to get that Foley in.
We're gonna irrigate the bladder.
We're gonna save this one.
- You want me to...?
- No, no, he can stay.
Cycle the lavage fluids.
Repeat the temp, max out the blower.
- Cardiac activity on the monitor.
- What?
- Looks like P.E.A.
- That's good.
Amp of bicarb.
Charge the paddles to 60.
- We don't have anything to shock.
- We will.
- Pacing pads.
- Good lung sounds.
- Come on, Joey. Come on.
- V-tach.
Yeah, baby, let's go. Clear.
- Polymorphic.
- Okay, charge to 120.
Check for a pulse. Clear.
Bingo. Normal sinus.
Thank you, God.
Fem stick him for labs.
Full trauma panel, ABG and an art line.
Get a second cutdown.
Eighteen-gauge angiocath.
- Anything after the line?
- Wait and see.
-10 blade.
- Hey, it stopped raining.
Impaction with mild or no displacement.
Probably a type 1.
The fracture line traverses straight from the greater to lesser trochanters.
What do you think, orthopedic surgery?
Depends on the orthopod, but I'd try to keep them away from her.
One third of the elderly who go under the knife for these kind of injuries...
...die within a year from post-op complications.
She's panicking. Heart rate's up.
BP's falling.
Get her out!
- Gam?
- John.
- John, are you there?
- I'm here.
I want to go home.
- Not quite yet.
- Call your grandfather to pick me up.
I want to go home.
- Grandpa's not here.
- Get him.
Grandpa's dead.
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.
You were in a car accident.
Remember, Gam? You broke your hip?
Oh, yes.
Of course.
I hit a dog. I hit a dog.
He was in the middle of the street.
Is she okay?
No.
Not really.
That baby okay?
Yeah.
Dr. Greene revived a drowned hypothermic boy tonight.
Came in ice-cold and not breathing, no pulse, and he got him back.
It was a miracle.
You all right?
What is it?
- She's pregnant.
- Who?
Nicole.
I see.
- Is that why she was stealing?
- No. That's a-
That's a habit. She doesn't know how to trust people.
Trusting people isn't really the problem.
Her father kicked her out when she was 16.
She's had to learn to live on her own.
Her father?
She panicked, I guess. I don't know.
I was just trying to help her.
I didn't think I'd be with her.
It just happened.
You sure it's yours?
- And that she's really pregnant?
- She's not like that. You don't know her.
Do you?
We gave him what's called an EEG, which is a brain scan.
Everything looks completely normal.
- So that's good?
- That's good.
You're gonna get your brother back, Daniel.
- Thank you for saving him.
- You're welcome.
Is my mom with him?
Yeah.
They're gonna move him upstairs...
...and you're gonna be up in the same room soon.
I'm gonna tell you something, but you can't tell any other kids, okay?
Okay.
Parents don't always know what they're doing.
Just because they're adults doesn't mean they know what's right.
In fact...
...some adults are wrong most of the time.
- I know that.
- Good.
And I want you to promise me something.
What?
Don't listen to them.
Don't believe that you're not just as good as your brother.
Just as smart.
Just as special.
One day they may realize that...
...but you can tell them it doesn't matter because you already knew.
You knew before they did.
Dr. Weaver, Dr. Romano is looking for you. The mother came out of surgery.
They had to perform a hysterectomy, but she's doing all right.
Yeah, I know. Thanks.
He also told me that I should try to stay away from you...
...if I'm gonna survive med school.
Well, nobody actually listens to Dr. Romano down here.
Yeah, I figured that.
It was pretty amazing what you did out there.
I was a little out of my element.
Well, you wouldn't know it.
Thank you.
Why don't you go up and take her baby to her?
- They'd let me?
- It's one of the perks.
- She's gonna think you're an angel.
- Yeah, well...
- ... she did almost see me glowing.
- You did great.
I mean, you took a risk, stayed focused, listened.
You did what was necessary.
That's an ER doc.
I was scared out there for a while.
- Gallant, I was scared the whole time.
- Right.
The fireman is sitting well in ICU.
He's gonna keep his hands.
- Cardiac activity is normal.
- Good. He got quite a jolt.
We saved everybody, didn't we?
Those people are all right now because we were there.
Some days are good days.
Yeah, I like the good days.
Enjoy them when they come.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

Yes.
Yes.
Yes, we still do it.
We also mark our faces and skin.
We paint everything... the jaguar, the fish.
Only after five days....
First we put paint... then charcoal.
It lasts five days.
About four or five days old.
Yes, I did.
Kuberene... and Iroa.
Yes, we played.
I don't remember, it was too long ago.
Kuberene was kind of a sad boy, but a good person.
The other boy was more cheerful... enjoyed playing.
One was more joyful, the other sad.
Yes, they had families.
The aruanas were immortal fishes that lived in hidden lakes inside the earth.
One day, though, Hariua, a smart young aruana... found a shaft of sunlight.
Immediately he remembered the wise advise of Kobehi, the oldest shaman:
''Avoid the shaft of sunlight that comes through a long, narrow, stony path.''
''It leads to suffering, pain, danger and death!''
But a strong feeling of curiosity took the young aruana closer....
We don't have... any written education... we get our knowledge from our parents and families.
They teach us about our destiny, about being an Indian... being a human being, and about life.
If we don't respect our elders... we'll be lost.
We really have to fight to try to maintain the maximum possible... of our culture, our language, our dances.
During the years of colonialism... the whites wanted us to be their slaves.
During the republic they tried... to change us into whites overnight.
They put the hospital here, the hotel, the school... the machines.
We were confused... not knowing how to live in this new situation... and after the years... of white man's civilization... we have to defend ourselves. But how?
By learning something from the whites, in the school.
Yesterday, an Indian... was wounded deep in his back.
He was in great pain.
We'll see if we will have to operate.
I'm seeing an airplane.
It's coming down from the sky.
We teach our children to read.
First in our language, Karaja, then in Portuguese.
Two languages at the same time.
We want to learn only the good things from the whites.
We don't want to live in the town... because there we would learn only... the bad things the whites are doing.
That's why we teach our children, so that won't happen.
Yes.
I liked it very much, I was very happy.
It touched me.
My feelings...
I have missed him a lot since I lost him.
And now, when I saw him...
I was very happy indeed.
I've been feeling so sad... and this was great for me.
It was great to see him alive.
I wish I could still see him.
When I saw him moving...
I felt he was alive again.
My father was killed... when a crocodile attacked him.
It was down at the lake.
He was fishing... with two friends.
He was steering the canoe.
The water was very low.
When the canoe passed over a crocodile... it went crazy and attacked my father... right at his neck.
Yes.
In this village... a lot of things have changed since your last visit.
But for me the saddest thing is that I've lost my husband.
I feel very lonely...
I miss the safety he gave me.
I remember long ago, one night he came into my hut... and the next morning we were husband and wife.
And so he stayed with me.
He was a very good person, very kind and hard working.
"On the northwest coast of Ireland...
"facing the Atlantic Ocean lies county Donegal...
"a place of rugged and unspoiled beauty...
"of black mountains and lush green fields...
"and tiny villages nestling by the sea.
"These outposts of Celtic tradition...
"offer a vibrant and colorful reminder of forgotten times...
and are well worth a visit. "
I couldn't agree more, only
I'm already 18 years of age...
and this is all I know.
- Aw, shite!
- "Man and beast live in rural harmony,"
just like it says in the guides...
but to work with Ian on his farm for the rest of my life?
I just don't share his passion for those sheep...
or Ollie's passion for rubber valves.
He never sells any, but it's not for the want of trying.
I'll come back and die here if that's the tradition...
but somewhere in between now and then...
I'd like to think I'd experience something... different.
"The many scenic walks" might be great for the visitor to enjoy...
but when the tide comes in, you'd better have a boat with you...
or you'll never make it home.
And if you have to do it twice a day... like Ian and his brother Kieran...
just to go to the pub...
Though as our butcher's assistant,
Siobhan will gladly tell you...
Kieran O'Donnell has the constitution of an ox...
and the wits to match.
Of course, you can always drown your sorrows in Pat and Kate's bar.
And I'm good at that...
which pleases my ma no end.
I think she'd rather I were under the influence of Father Mallone.
He'll try anything to get his flock to church.
He's just amplified the bell tower...
started the Kilvara Film Society...
and he's even got Pat and Kate to shut the pub...
so he's guaranteed a good turnout.
There's a film every second Thursday.
So far this year, we've seen
The Song of Bernadette,
Saint Joan and
The Keys of the Kingdom.
It's The Ten Commandments tonight.
Or it will be, once Father's gone through...
a few of his vital bits of business.
I'd like to thank all those of you who have contributed raffle prizes... to the St. Martha's Day dance at the end of the month.
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Duncannon.
- Now, uh...
- Sorry I'm late, Father.
Also, regarding the overseas aid thing... may I ask the person who took the trouble... to leave a pile of their old clothes on the church doorstep... whether next time they might consider washing them first?
- Lord, you make the effort, and that's the thanks you get.
- And finally...
- Never. There's people still awake.
- I am delighted to announce... that the new bells have arrived.
Now, I know there has been strong opposition in some quarters...
Nearly there, Father.
Uh, but, however...
I think even the skeptics will agree... that these are a more than adequate compromise.
St. Peter's itself.
What?
St. P...
The, uh, speaker system... still needs a little fine-tuning.
However, it has recordings from all the major churches around the world... at a fraction of the cost of replacing the old bells.
Uh, so thank God for modern technology.
Okay, Father. Right. Good. We're ready. Uh...
- Okay, Mickey.
- Hooray.
Lights off, Mickey.
Enjoy the movie...
The Ten Commandments.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!
- Shh!
- That's never Moses.
- Shut up. It's looking promising.
- Charlton Heston...
- Shut up.
- Who's Anna Christmas?
- Shh!
That's Bo Derek.
They've sent the wrong film.
I don't see anybody complaining.
Oh, yes. Oh, my God.
It's not the right film.
It is. You've forgotten this bit. The Red Sea. Look.
- Where's your man Moses?
- He'll be on in a minute.
- He's just getting the Israelites together.
- There are children here.
- Send them out for ice cream.
- This is disgusting.
- Father.
- I wonder whether this might be a trailer.
- Where's she going?
- Och!
It's a miracle.
- This is not The Ten Commandments.
- I can't see.
- Get off!
- I did not pay my good money... to come and see this... this filth.
- It's nice to get a surprise once in a while.
- Get out of the way.
Father Mallone. Father!
That's enough.
Thank you. Thank you.
- Mickey, lights, please.
- What?
- Aw, no.
- Thanks.
I'm afraid that'll have to be it for tonight.
But, seeing as we're all here together... what about a spot of community singing?
- Ahh.
- Bloody hell, Ollie.
- It was just a film.
- Yeah, but seeing her there put it all into perspective.
What are you saying?
I mean, I love it here... you lads, the bar... but I'd give it all up for her.
- Who?
- Bo Derek.
- Bo Derek?
- Yeah. If Bo called, I'd go.
Her sort eat your sort for breakfast.
If Bo Derek came looking for you,
I wouldn't worry yourself, Ollie.
- You're not her type.
- And how do you know?
Because I do.
And when was the last time you were out in Hollywood or wherever it is she lives?
- Aye, he's got a point.
- No, he does not have a point.
Hollywood actresses do not... not if they have any choice in the matter... hook up with agricultural rubber jointing salesmen. They do not.
- So who do they go for?
- Who? Bo Derek's sort?
Kids... keep 'em feeling young.
You'd be right up Bo's street.
- She'd better hurry, then.
- Why? Pammy Anderson got her eye on him?
Plenty of local beauties lining up, I'll bet... good-looking lad like Sean.
Beauties? Around here?
You're joking.
Must be coming out when we're tucked up in bed, eh, Kate?
Come on, you.
It's time.
- Mum.
- Come on.
Good night, Da.
You're right, though, Pat, you know?
There are no decent women around here.
- They've all moved to the big city.
- There's always Mrs. O'Leary.
Oh, come on. Dearie O'Leary?
You’re joking.
She's nice enough, though she's a bit past her sell-by date.
So I've heard.
You see?
This is my point.
That's what I told my ma.
I still wouldn't be living at home... if the village was bursting with hot stuff.
Pat, can me brother use the gents?
All right.
Go on and learn your lesson.
Siobhan, look, you're the opposite sex, aren't you?
- Maybe you can help.
- What's that?
See, we're looking for attractive women with a view to marriage.
And why might I be able to help, do you think?
Well, that cousin of yours Bernadette did a bit of modeling once upon a time.
Any chance of getting her down for the weekend?
We don't speak that often.
She's a bit common for my taste.
Don't let that put you off doing the right thing.
No. She's still family, after all... so I'll warn her to stay a million miles away from you, Kieran O'Donnell.
It's a bachelor's life for you, and you may as well admit it.
You could put a full-page ad in the Irish Times, and you'd get no takers.
No one's that desperate, right, Pat? Come on.
Aw, she's no sense of humor, that girl.
- She works for you.
- You wouldn't use the Irish Times, would you?
Any of the Dublin papers... wouldn't get the women to trek all the way up here.
Hmm.
You have the Cork Examiner... the Shanagarry Gazette.
- Killarney's supposed to have some fine-looking women. - Or there's Galway.
- Aye, aye.
- Waterford's your spot.
See, when I was playing away there with the team...
I was on three girls a night.
- I heard the girls in Kinsale are nice.
- You're too young.
- I'm not.
- You are. What about Connemara?
Lads, can we not get a broad agreement?
All I want's a destination... somewhere to place the ad.
Miami.
- If it's good enough for Miss April...
- Ohh.
Ahh.
Mmm. You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
- Mmm.
- Oh, God.
All done.
Right.
Time for bed.
Come on. Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
Aah!
Gotcha.
Ma... how long before
I have breasts?
What?
Why?
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Now, listen, you...
You've got plenty of time.
And, anyway, boys like girls for lots of reasons.
Loads... because they're interesting... or clever... or because they're funny.
Not just because they have obvious breasts and wear skimpy swimsuits.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Right! Shut up!
That's enough!
Thank you.
Now, we've got to agree on this.
Kieran, would you?
- Good man. Get up there.
- Go on, Kieran.
- Go on, Kieran.
- Thank you.
Right. Are you ready?
This is it.
- "Wanted: Sexy, young"...
- "Attractive," Kieran. We settled on "attractive. "
"attractive young women...
"to share in the great outdoor life.
Indoor facilities also available. "
That bit's in brackets.
Right. New line.
- "Irish men invite sexy"...
- That "sexy" went as well, Kieran.
- For God's sake, Kieran, will you read it as it is?
- Just read it.
Sorry...
"invite American women to join them...
"for their annual
St. Martha's Day dance... with a view thereafter to marriage. "
- Mm-hmm.
- "Ideal age range between 20 and 21."
- Whoo!
- "Must be fit and sporty. "
- Whoo-hoo!
- Think they'll get the meaning from that last bit?
"Your would-be
Celtic cousins... are rich... wealthy"...
- "Solvent. "
- "Solvent. "
It's crossed out.
"Are solvent...
"fit and able to supply freshly slaughtered meat and game in abundance. "
- Good one, Kieran.
- Yeah.
"All in all, an irresistible package. "
Well, that says it all, eh?
Waah!
God bless America.
I'd like to be in America
Everything's free in America
For the last time, will you hurry up?
I'm almost done.
I've animals to see to.
So have I.
Yeah, well, yours are dead.
They can wait that bit longer.
I'd like to be in America
Everything's free in America
Ian, your body is a temple... and you can't rush on the upkeep.
What the hell are you talking about?
Your brother, Kieran... man of fulsome appetite... in all things bad for you... is no more.
No. A lean, mean... seducing machine... is about to break cover.
What?
Press-ups.
- Just the one?
- And seven and a half sit-ups.
Plus, I've had nothing to drink all day.
It's half-eight in the morning.
Going somewhere?
Just off to the old team reunion.
Might be a bit late.
- You don't mind, though, eh, love?
- Why would I?
Just make sure you're back before Ella goes to sleep.
And wipe the lipstick off this time.
Oh, come on, Kate.
Don't be like that.
- You taking me to school, Da?
- Sorry, pet.
Your da's got other things on his mind.
- There you go.
- Oh. Thanks, Mary.
Thank you, Dollie.
Mrs. Doyle.
All right?
- Still alive, thank God.
- Glad to hear it.
- What are you doing, Son?
- Nothing.
- I put the money in the till.
- Leave it.
You'll be late for Ian.
I'll do it.
No. The thing is, it's for the lads, actually, Mum.
Really, it's... it's no bother at all.
Right.
I'll be off, then.
Kate.
Sean, how are you doing?
- Kate.
- Mary.
- How are you, Kate?
- Grand, thanks, Dollie.
- You're looking well.
- Oh.
"Miami Herald,
Florida. "
Miami?
Tea, anyone?
"Twenty, twenty-one.
Must be fit and sporty. "
- Who on earth do they think would answer this ad?
- Filipinos?
From Miami?
I don't think so.
For heaven's sake, what were they thinking of?
I knew something was going on, but this...
I'm sick telling Sean what'll come of his hanging round that bar... but will he listen?
And it's not just Kieran, is it?
It's all of them.
All the single ones.
Mary?
Sorry I'm late.
Fallen a bit behind today.
Ladies.
Have you got anything for me?
- Just the one, Brian.
- Cheers.
You should never have sent that letter on.
Aw, come on, Siobhan, you heard what was in it.
If it's fun you're wanting, let's get after the ringleaders with a couple of bricks.
Sort the randy so-and-sos out.
Is there any particular randy so-and-so you're thinking of there, Siobhan?
- Ooh.
- No.
No one specific, then, who you maybe come into contact with on a daily basis?
Kate, I'm sure we all know people... who are more interested in these
American women than they ought to be... but that doesn't mean it bothers us, does it?
Oh, come on, Siobhan.
It's a bit of fun, that's all.
- It's no big deal.
- All right, then... but just let that Kieran O'Donnell say one wrong word to me.
What American women want is a bit of style.
See? I ironed that meself.
Makes all the difference, you know, things like that.
Here. No.
Smell this.
Go on. No?
See, that's Brutus... and it's named after this Roman fella.
It's full of these phero-somethings.
It drives women wild.
- Kate.
- Kieran.
- Attitude of mind.
- What?
Most of the lads in here, you see, they wouldn't understand an underarm deodorant... if it just jumped up and bit them in the face.
See, I was saying to Ian, but he doesn't understand, you know?
I mean, it's a waste the way he turns himself out.
- I know what you're saying.
- Mmm.
God, it can't be easy, huh?
Surrounded by all this testosterone night after night, huh?
God, what's the smell?
Ahem.
They beat us, 20-21.
- What?
- Tonight. The game.
- Twenty, twenty-one?
- It was just the way it turned out.
You're doing something wrong there, girls.
New players... that's what we need, if we're going to put the edge back in it.
You're right. All the drama's gone.
Perhaps we should advertise.
Yeah. Someone young, fit and sporty and ready for action.
Hmm. Only what do we have instead?
Half an hour each way with the same old crew.
Isn't that right, girls?
Yeah.
Yeah. These days, I just close my eyes and dream of the final whistle.
I'm sure we can just keep on hoping, huh?
- Slainte.
- Slainte.
Advertise?
What?
You're a wicked woman.
You know, don't you?
- All right, Pat.
- Ollie.
- What's all this?
- What do you mean?
- With the flowers.
- Well, they're mostly begonias... but I thought I'd drop in a few geraniums...
Give it a more fluid line of color across the whole display.
So, they are yours, then? I mean, you're not looking after them for someone?
- They're nice.
- Thank you.
- Did you arrange them yourself?
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.
- Hmm.
- What?
It's just that I never imagined you being so delicate.
Delicate?
Kilvara... it's the place to be on the 30th of May.
So hurry now to avoid disappointment.
Time to get that good suit out of the back of the wardrobe, lads... and, ladies, there will never be a better time to splash out on a new dress.
You forget, don't you?
- What?
- Pat... how good looking he is.
He could still have his pick, couldn't he?
I mean, professional sportsmen... never leaves 'em, does it?
Siobhan, hold the fort.
Shan't be long.
Kieran.
How you doing?
Fine. Just fine.
I'd like you to wash it, please,
Giovanni.
- Wash it?
- Water, you know.
- Water? Why?
- Because.
Because it's been a while.
It's been never.
I have never washed your hair, Kieran.
I've never washed anyone's hair, ever.
Well, then, opportunity knocks.
Look, here's the deal,
Giovanni.
I want to look like the one person in this village worth getting to know.
I want to walk through those doors looking like a million dollars.
Capisce?
Ahh.
Giovanni.
I heard you were very good.
Morning.
- Kieran!
- Yes?
Oh, my God.
Now, now, then, who needs some assistance?
Here. Kate, yours, I believe?
Aye, it is.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
And... may I say how attractive you're looking today?
You're not looking so bad yourself, Kieran.
Right. Let's serve the rest of you lovely ladies, shall we?
Siobhan? Come on, try and concentrate.
There's a good girl.
Siobhan.
Siobhan! Siobhan!
Dirty animal.
Oh, Jesus.
I tell you what, Kieran,
Marilyn Monroe would be dead jealous.
Would you look at the state of that?
Pretty eye-catching, eh?
- Giovanni's taken photos.
- For an insurance claim?
To put on the wall, you know.
Show what he's capable of.
- That should make people sit still.
- Come on. The priest is here.
- Thank you.
- Father.
God, I hope this doesn't take too long.
I have a quarter-inch silicone repeater valve waiting for me.
Any idea what he wants us for?
- Mail-order brides, Pat.
- Needs must, I'm afraid, Father.
The point is, they haven't gone to all this trouble for a few cheap sexual thrills.
We'll take it, though.
Marriage... that's what this is all about.
They want no more than to stand in front of you in this beautiful building... and hear you declare them married.
Me?
But, sure,
I've never actually...
Of course, you've only ever done funerals.
I know how to, it's just... well, there's never been any call.
Exactly.
Just think of it.
At last, on your own patch, in your own church... with the accompanying bells of Our Lady of Victories, Brazil... joining together two loving individuals.
What could be more natural in the eyes of God?
And when will this... ad actually be appearing?
Next Saturday, second edition.
And then the ladies... they'll need time to get organized... their air tickets and stuff... so we thought that the dance is a perfect occasion for us all... to get to know each other a bit better.
In which case, I want you boys to understand something very clearly.
What?
Now, I fully appreciate that... given the situation that we're talking about here... that there is bound to be a certain amount of...
Isn't there?
I mean, you wouldn't... buy the first suit you see in a shop, would you?
You'd expect to try on a few before you'd part with your cash.
However, there have to be limits.
I mean, endlessly slipping on one jacket after another...
The point is...
I know a good suit when I see one... the cut, the cloth... the silky, soft feel of it against your skin.
Now, I know how tempting it is... to burst through that shop door... a seething mass of acquisitiveness... rifling your way through the rails... until all that's left in your wake... is a pile of discarded frenzy!
Uh, so we must try and restrict ourselves... to a little bit of... window-shopping... until you are quite sure you have found the garment that will fit you.
Now, if that's all perfectly clear... you have my blessing.
If he wanted a new suit out of the deal, he should just come clean and said so.
- You're missing the point.
- What are you taking his side for?
Ian, if anyone's entitled, you should get in there, get yourself a girl.
'Cause you're a good bloke.
Even for a brother, you are.
- Thanks.
- I've worked it all out, Ian.
The keen ones, they could be pulling up here anytime between now and Friday.
That's even allowing for a short delay while they wait for a bus.
- God, I hope you don't get killed in the rush.
- I'm ready.
- You really think they're gonna come, don't you?
- Why wouldn't they?
Remember that Valerie Clacton from Doncaster?
Yeah.
Three months it took me to get over her.
- I couldn't speak.
- I know.
So exotic.
Miami. For God's sake!
Hey.
Ahh.
Ma, I don't want you worrying about me... on this American thing.
I'm not.
You're a sensible boy.
I know, but... well, what I mean is...
Well, if I do meet a woman...
These things happen, Ollie.
Yes, but I don't want it upsetting you, Ma.
I try and cope.
In fact, I was just thinking what to do with your room.
No. There's no need, Ma.
Listen.
I intend to bring my bride back here to live.
You'll not be losing having me around the place.
Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, eh?
And another thing...
I don't want you searching out some mousy little number... just because you think she might fit in here.
If it's a fun-loving, all-American ball-breaker you fancy... you go right on ahead.
Okay. I will.
Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks, Ma.
Good hunting, Son.
Ollie?
- All right.
- Mickey?
- How you doing?
- Good. Heh.
- What brings you up?
- Och, just out for a walk, you know.
Oh, me, too.
Oi! You two!
What the hell are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?
I am.
I mean, I'm on me way.
Which is where you ought to.
I'm searching for rabbits.
Don't look at me like that.
Que sera, sera.
That's Kieran O'Donnell's attitude.
Take it or leave it.
When those American girls get off that bus... they'll want to see some sophistication.
- Pat.
- Ollie.
- Kieran. Mickey.
- Pat.
- Rabbits.
- Work.
Training.
- What?
- Seventy-five press-ups this morning.
- One after the other?
- There's the bus.
Here's the bus.
Oh, no.
There's no one getting off.
There are no bunnies around here.
- Busy?
- No.
- Anyone at all?
- No.
The post's been.
No replies again?
- Nah.
- Oh, dear.
Well, we always knew it'd be short notice, you know.
They probably decided it's better to get straight over for the shindig, you know... rather than waste time writing to us first.
Oh, that'll be it for sure.
Siobhan... take it easy, will you?
Look, you're all uptight.
I've noticed that lately... upsetting yourself...
'cause you're not coping with being a country girl.
Now, that's not a criticism, you know?
But it is a fact.
It's a fact that you don't understand the world of the sophisticates... the beautiful people... which, let's be honest, those American girls have inhabited for years.
See, now, that's bothering you.
Well, what I say is, don't let it.
Rural girls aren't supposed to understand fashion and stuff like that.
They're built to roll up their sleeves... and, you know, get their hands dirty.
Siobhan, just relax, will you?
Stop being so tense.
'Cause you're more than acceptable, you know... in your own way.
Honest, you are.
Kate, do I look like a country girl to you?
No. Of course not.
What makes you ask that?
Oh, that Kieran.
Doesn't matter.
- Why don't you tell him?
- Tell him what? What an idiot he is?
No. That you like him.
Like him?
Don't be daft.
I tell you, I don't care how sophisticated those American girls are...
I pity the one who answers that stupid ad.
- "Fit and sporty, aged 20-21."
- Aye.
We'd go for something a bit more... exotic, wouldn't we?
Exotic?
Sean, a woman is a woman.
If you've a grasp of the basic human skills... you've nothing to worry about.
What I'm saying is, it's a complicated business, that's all.
I mean, what if...
What'll happen to your mam if it does work out with one of these women?
I'm not unreasonable.
- The cellar's been damp-proofed.
- See, this is my point.
Everybody's caught up in the heat of the moment.
Nobody's thinking of the future, what lies ahead.
Ollie, are you listening?
Ollie, what's wrong?
My God, you're right.
What was I thinking?
- What's the matter?
- I can't do it, Sean.
- I mean, I've never... bedroom-type stuff.
- What?
Do you mean you're a...
Only technically.
It's not like I haven't practiced.
It's just... well, it's not the same, is it?
And there's gonna come a time...
Tomorrow. Christ!
I need the female perspective on this.
All right. Ideal man.
Whoo!
- We have five votes for France. - Mmm! - Mmm!
- Two for Scotland.
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Zero for Ireland.
- Whee!
One for Fiji.
- And six for Italy!
- Whoo! - Ha, ha!
So, where do we find these
Italian stallions, then?
- What about that waiter in Bundoran?
- Nah, he's Polish.
The bus driver... does the Friday run?
- Jackie's from Cork.
- He's very dark-skinned.
- That's 'cause he never washes.
- What about Giovanni's younger brother?
- He's half-Italian.
- Aye, but it's not his interesting half.
Let's face it.
There's nothing exotic around here.
Yes, there is.
There's Spanish.
- Spanish.
- It's the fishing season, girls.
Just a question of casting our nets.
Hello, boys!
Ollie, what are you doing here?
- I'm a man, Sean.
- I know that.
My God, you never did.
How? I know how.
I mean, what happened?
Your partner was of the two-legged variety, I hope.
- Sean!
- Sorry.
It's just, around here, where would you go?
You didn't.
Mrs. O'Leary?
Eleventh hour.
What can you do?
But a goal's a goal.
So, what was it like?
That good?
You can't be a bit more specific?
"To whom it may concern...
"especially foreign visitors:
"This is to certify that I, Mrs. N. O'Leary...
"have enjoyed a thorough session with Ollie Doyle.
"He's all man, and a damn fine time can be had with him.
This is true.
Signed, Mrs. O'Leary. "
- Ollie?
- What?
What?
- What happened?
- Ahh.
I just couldn't.
I mean, she was lovely and all.
Gentle.
And she really wanted to help out.
It's just... well,
I'm not gonna marry her, am I?
I mean, she's not the one
I want to settle down with.
So what did you do?
I fixed her boiler.
Ah, it was cooked to heaven.
And the valve differential was shot.
She could have blown the whole place up.
She did suggest some reading, though.
Now, what do you mean,
"P.O. box"?
Well, it's a box where things can be delivered.
We deliver to your house.
But I don't want it sent to me house.
What don't you want sent to your house?
Nothing.
I... I mean...
Well, I'm talking hypothetically here, right?
And what I'm saying is... in the eventuality of me actually being sent something... which I didn't want delivered up there, but down here... how would I go about ordering one of those P.O. thingummies?
Hypothetically.
Well, you can't.
We don't do them.
Of course, if you wanted to have stuff sent care of here...
I'd be happy to keep it for you till you wanted to pick it up.
Right.
- Mwaah!
- Ma, I'm back!
I can see that.
Hey, cotton wool head, catch.
That's a dance you owe me tomorrow night.
- Yeah, sure.
- Right.
Thanks.
She's very excited.
First big dance, you know.
- You left early last night.
- Yeah.
- Did Kieran get back all right?
- Sort of.
Found him in the field this morning.
Final hill defeated him.
He'll be dead before those
American girls arrive.
It's the anticipation that's killing him.
Can you imagine him coming face-to-face with one of them?
She's got all that ahead of her.
- What, drunkenness?
- Yeah. Drunken boys and broken hearts.
She's got everything to look forward to.
Yeah, everything.
- I couldn't do it now, mind.
- What?
All that courtship stuff.
Don't care how exciting it is.
You just know too much.
Makes you glad you're old, doesn't it?
I mean, me, you know... old... not...
I realize.
- I wasn't...
- I know that.
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, I'll have a pint.
- All right, Ian.
- Hi, Pat.
Hey, come on!
All right?
- Lads.
- Ollie.
Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
We're off. The dance has started.
Ella.
Come on, let's get moving, join the girls.
Tell Laura I love her
Kieran, what's wrong?
What's the point?
What, the dance?
No women.
The American women.
Look at that.
It's 8:00.
You know, not receiving any letters or phone calls, I...
But tonight... tonight I thought they'd be swarming all over the place.
- You start to wonder.
- They'll come.
Maybe not tonight.
Maybe it's just too soon, but they'll come.
- They will?
- Yeah. I can feel it.
We'll be sitting here one night, Kieran, one night soon.
We'll be having a wee drink, minding our own business... when all of a sudden, through that door will walk a goddess.
Hello. Good evening.
We are here!
Where is Señorita Siobhan?
Where is the dance?
Where did you find them?
I don't care so long as she finds them again next year.
There you are now.
Get out of that.
Yeah!
- Will you dance?
- Come on.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Come on, Sean!
Kathleen, can I have another gin and tonic when you're ready, please?
- All right.
- Siobhan.
Kieran.
- Thanks.
- You look incredible.
I didn't realize it was you.
So you like it, then?
Like it?
It makes you look so...
You know? You know?
I thought you would.
You wore it special?
Let me get you a drink.
- No, you're all right. I just want this one. Thanks.
- Are you off somewhere?
- Whoo.
- Why do you want to know?
- Mad.
- Ha.
I thought it might be somewhere
I could come too, you know?
What are you asking me?
I'm asking you, you know... if you fancy a bit of shilly-shallying?
Oh, my God, Kieran.
"Oh, my God," yes, or "Oh, my God," no?
Ooh, ooh!
"Shilly-shallying. "
Kate?
Over here.
So you are.
- I didn't drag you away, did I?
- You? Nah.
- No, no.
- I just fancied a walk.
- Here. Here.
- Thanks.
God, it clears your head, doesn't it, when you get outside?
Yeah, it does.
Those fishermen seem to be making the girls happy.
Not just the girls... us older women, too.
Did you believe the Americans would come?
Never gave it much thought.
No, you didn't, did you?
Spanish sailors.
Poor Kieran.
Should have been looking a bit closer to home.
- Siobhan?
- Yeah.
Och, it's not his fault.
Sometimes the closer you get to something, the harder it is to see it.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
- Beautiful night, isn't it?
- Aye. Beautiful.
The thing about the collar valve is, though... no matter how porous it is, the membrane that surrounds it...
- Ollie, can I stop you there?
- Yeah?
You're boring me rigid.
Come on!
What did you say to her?
You make the effort.
You try and encourage the plain ones, huh?
I'll tell you something. She'll be a long time getting down off the shelf... if she carries on like that.
Conversation skills of an ox.
- Her head's been turned.
- What?
She's had her head turned.
You're right there, Kieran.
Flippin' interfered with, the lot of them.
Have you seen the hip movement that's going on out there?
Just let me outside with a couple of them, you know?
See how light they are on their feet then.
- Molesting our women.
- Go on, Kieran. Sort them out.
- Yeah. Go on, Kieran.
- Go on, Kieran. Come on.
- Atta boy.
- Give it to them, Kieran.
All right, that's enough.
You can stop it now.
Stop it!
I said that's enough now!
What the hell do you think you're doing, huh... with your hands all over our women?
- Kieran...
- Don't worry now, Siobhan. It's all right now.
Let me tell you something there...
Manuel or whatever your name is...
You might have enjoyed a little bit of early doors success, you know... with your fancy accents and your show-offy guitar playing.
You have picked the wrong place to go strutting your stuff, 'cause, er... you see, me and the boys know exactly what you're up to... and we're not havin' it!
Do you understand?
We're not havin' it!
They don't like that, do they?
What I mean is, youse better just feck off... you and the boys, or me and the lads'll give you a good hiding, see?
Lovely lament.
Fair play to you, boy.
Hey, Kieran.
Duck and weave.
- Don't remember getting much back-up.
- Nothin' to do with me.
Ah, sure, you're quite the married man, aren't you... you know, when it suits?
Watch what you're sayin', Kieran.
Why?
Come on, Pat. Look: flowers, the clothes, the training...
- At least be honest about what you've been up to.
- I don't know what you mean.
The only comfort I take is that it wouldn't have made a blind bit of difference.
Do you really think those American girls would have come all the way... over here for a couple of rounds with a married man?
- Watch it, Kieran.
- Why?
Come on, you've been acting like an idiot!
And a desperate one at that.
Oh, is that right?
What's all this, then?
It's me display.
Why, what's it look like?
Never used to be like that, though, did it?
Used to keep a bit of haslet and a couple boxes of eggs. It's all red meat now, isn't it?
Joint after joint of thick, bright, bleeding beef.
For God's sake, man... you might as well run up and down the high street waving your dick in the air.
- Oh, is that so?
- Siobhan had you sussed, Kieran.
You care about nothing except exercising your own best end.
Stop!
Stop it!
You wanna pick a fight, pick on someone who knows how to do it, you bastard!
Ian. All right. Actually, Ian, Ian, Ian,
I'm all right now.
What the hell's going on?
- Well?
- Why don't you ask Casanova over there?
- Leave it, leave it, leave it, Pat!
- Come on, now!
Tell 'em who started it.
Look at you, all tarted up like a dog's dinner.
Was that for your missus you got dressed up, eh?
Was it buggery?
- Kieran, Kieran.
- Pat! Pat!
If you have to fight... at least have the decency not to do it in front of your own daughter.
Especially when it's over other women.
Yeah, sure, he has no shame, has he?
He thinks he's that much better
'cause he used to be famous.
"Used to be "equals " might as well never have been" in my book.
- I'll give you one more warning.
- You've no need, 'cause I've finished with you for good.
- So from now on you can get somebody else to do your butchery for you.
- What?
That's right, you heard.
Get your meat somewhere else.
Fine. If that's the way you want it, you'd better look for another bar to go drinkin' in.
That's right. 'Cause as of now, you're barred indefinitely.
And that worries me?
I just want you to try it.
Maybe you should make up with Pat... stop in at the bar.
I'll not give him any of my money.
Besides, I don't need to be in there every evening.
I'm not an alcoholic.
I can drink at home.
- Jesus!
- That bad, is it?
- It's like diesel.
- Ah, come on.
Play a bit of decent music, and a few jars of the old hooch... who needs women?
I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny
I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny
- Ah, you're better off never getting involved, you know?
Sean, they're like drugs, women.
Just say no.
What's wrong?
I'm in love.
I'm in love, and my heart's broken.
Siobhan.
Siobhan!
Where are you?
Sean, find Siobhan... and... and tell her
I love her. Yeah?
Sean, tell Siobhan
I love her!
Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura
Not to cry
Siobhan!
Siobhan!
Siobhan!
Come back to me.
Shh!
- Siobhan!
- It's Ella!
I... I want you.
You don't understand.
It's Ella, you idiot, and yes, I do understand!
- Where's my Siobhan?
- Stop calling her! Go get some sleep.
I... can't live without her.
It's killing me.
I... I'm in love.
Sean.
Sean, where are you?
I'm in the gutter.
And there are the stars.
Ah.
- Ma, where's the aspirins?
- I've moved them.
Happening a lot lately.
Don't worry. I'm not planning on going for the hat trick.
I can't say I'm surprised, the company you keep down at that bar.
I was at Kieran's.
I see. Is that supposed to make me feel better?
Why does that not have the same effect on me... as if you'd said,
"I was at Father Mallone's"?
I just want you to look after yourself.
- I don't want you to end up...
- Mary.
Sorry I'm late.
Sean. Here we go.
Special delivery from Amsterdam for Mr. Ollie Doyle... care of the post office,
Kilvara, county Donegal.
And he's welcome to them. They weigh a ton.
Right.
Ma, Da didn't run off because the lads turned his head... or because he spent half his life in Pat's place.
The reason Da left was because he wasn't a very nice man.
Look, what I mean is, the way Da was... it's not true of all men.
But the point I'm trying to make is, if what I do... includes some of the things that Da used to do... like eating and drinking and enjoying the occasional company of other men... that doesn't mean that
I'm gonna turn out like him.
Do you see?
Both of them.
They're both from Amsterdam.
Get the kettle on.
- Hey, Sean.
- Are you after your packages, Ollie?
- They've arrived?
- Aye. They've arrived, but...
- For the last time, you shouldn't have looked.
- Thank God customs didn't.
Those magazines are educational.
Oh, yes. If you've a passing interest in the Inquisition, they are.
Look at it.
Listen, Mary, I'm sorry if I offended you, but what a man does... in his private life is his own business, and I want my stuff back.
Absolutely not.
- But why?
- It's for the best, luv.
Your ma knows that as well.
I thought you and Ma loved each other.
And we do.
When me and your ma first met... it was like when you sign for your first professional side.
You'll do anything for your team.
Then gradually, over time, things change.
You find that you don't feel that same... Rrr.
And when that happens,
Ella, luv... there's only one thing for it... a transfer and a new club.
That doesn't mean to say, you don't have strong feelings for your old team.
They're the ones who taught you how to play properly, after all... and you'll never forget that.
- Da.
- What is it, luv?
You're an idiot.
Are you all right?
I heard about your dad, Ella.
I'm sorry.
- Come on. Let's go!
- Where are we going?
Are all men like my dad, Sean?
- How do you mean?
- You know.
It's this place.
Stuck in the middle of nowhere... sends you potty.
- I'm going to leave as soon as I'm 17.
- What?
Well, you wanna go.
I know you do.
Only 'cause I wanna see different things.
It's not 'cause I don't like it here,
'cause I do.
Really?
You like the wind and the rain and Da's flat beer... and fellas always going on arguing and complaining?
You like all that?
Come here.
Come on.
Now just look at that.
That's ours as well, Ella...
Yours and mine.
Now tell me that's not beautiful.
You could cope fine on your own, Kate.
I managed.
I know, but I want a fresh start... for Ella and for myself.
Get out while you can, Kate.
I don't blame you.
- Is that right?
- What would anyone want to live here for?
Still not back at the butcher's, then?
Go back and work in that dump?
Ha. Don't think so.
You'll feel better when he gets someone new in.
Do you think he'd do that, advertise me job?
Oh, he's very big on adverts, Kieran.
Well, good luck to him.
"Bleached blonde, sex mad, alcoholic butcher... seeks new assistant. "
I don't think he'll have many takers.
Ah, you had a lucky escape there, Siobhan.
- And here was us thinkin' you were soft on him.
- Nah. I don't go for blondes.
Neither do I.
It's been that long
I can't remember.
- Mary.
- Ollie, what do you want?
- I've come for me mags.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Ha. Hmph!
- Don't you scoff at me, Mary Mulligan.
I have something to say to you.
I'm 36 years of age, and I'm a man.
Only, half the things I should have done in my life... well, I haven't.
Well, that's going to change.
I want a woman, Mary.
I want to... pierce the celestial heavens with our love-making.
I want to worship at the altar of her naked body... and shroud her breasts with the first scented dew of a summer's morning.
I want to be with her forever... touching and tasting her, melting into her very soul... until we become one: liquid, languid... replete and consummate.
That's what I want.
And I'm not gonna get it when I still haven't the first idea... what goes on between consenting adults when the lights go out.
So, if that's clear,
I won't trouble you any further.
I've research to do.
Good day.
I wish I'd never set eyes on that flippin' film.
Aye, it's sex, sex, sex.
That's modern cinema for you.
I tell you, if that Demi Moore came through those doors right now...
I'd say to her,
"Demi, love... put your kit back on, take your potted beef and sod off. "
See, they're nothing but trouble, those American girls.
Aye.
Huh?
- See you later?
- Aye. See you later, Mickey.
- Mickey.
- All right, Ian.
Ian, have you heard?
Pat left Kate.
Yeah, I know.
Still, I'd say that's a result for you.
What?
I said that's a result for you.
Way's clear now.
What are you talking about?
Ian, I'm your brother.
- Here.
- Why didn't you say something?
Why should I, when you never did, eh?
The main thing is, you can get in there now.
- Tell her exactly how you feel.
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Me and Kate, you know...
- Oh, you big sissy, so you are.
You see that?
That broke.
See, I know it's broke,
'cause I heard it break.
I'll tell you, it's a sweet sound, Ian.
It's the sound of a man standing up for what he believes in.
All right, not standing up for long, admittedly... but, you know, standing up all the same.
Come on, Ian.
Look, you've a chance.
You should go for it.
Ah, fuck.
Look at me.
Look, what have I got to look forward to?
For the rest of me life, sat on me arse... drinking beer and watching satellite football.
Which still isn't as good as having a girlfriend.
Is it?
I have a problem, Father.
I need advice.
There's a...
There's a suit,
Father.
You know?
That...
That I've seen...
I mean, it was made for me, you know?
Tailor-made, but, uh...
- Buy it, Ian.
- I can't.
- But you just...
- This...
This is the most... beautiful suit in the world, Father.
But...
I can't stop thinking... what if it looks ridiculous?
What if...
What if this exquisite thing you've... you've yearned for your whole life... looked better on somebody else?
Somebody who could... truly do it justice?
- God, what am I doing here?
- Ian, wait, please.
Love is God's most precious gift.
It is also his most fragile.
It exists for a moment here, maybe... or an instant there, perhaps... against the odds and despite everything that's going on around it.
So... if this suit really is made for you... and you're lucky enough still to have the opportunity to enjoy it... trust the tailor that cuts the cloth.
- Mary...
- Dollie, is Ollie in?
Ollie, Mary would like to speak to you.
- What do you want?
- Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Siobhan!
Siobhan!
Siobhan?
Siobhan!
What do you want?
- I love you, and I'm sorry.
- Pardon?
- I said I love you.
- The other bit.
Will you go out with me?
- No.
- Ah, wait! Siobhan! Wait!
- Kieran!
- Look, will you just listen to me for one minute?
No.
You listen to me.
For 90% of the day, you're adjusting your bollocks... scratching your bollocks... or otherwise playing with your bollocks.
You're determined to drink Ireland dry.
You think you're God's gift to women, and just look at that haircut!
And last but not least by a long, long way, you said I was "acceptable. "
"Acceptable. "
I'm more than that,
Kieran O'Donnell.
I am 100% full-volume... fanny-possessing flame of a woman.
And if you don't like it, you can lump it.
Is that a yes?
Kate?
Kate!
- Kate!
- Ian.
- Have you seen Ma?
- No.
- Have you seen Kate?
- No. Why?
- What was that?
- Hello, one, two?
One, two?
- All right?
- All right.
"She walks in beauty... like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies"...
- Are you sure this is working?
- Of course I'm sure.
All right, there's no need to get nasty.
Just don't think it's loud enough.
- Go on.
- I'll start again.
"She walks in beauty like the night...
"in cloudless climes and starry skies...
"and all that's best of dark and bright...
"meet in her aspect and her eyes;
"Thus mellowed to the tender light... which heaven to gaudy day denies"?
Jesus, that doesn't rhyme with anything.
You're not saying it right, Ian.
You've got to take more time.
I don't have time. The woman
I adore is leaving me.
Do you understand that?
I think we'll drop the poem, Father.
Put on the tape, Sean.
 Give me
A kiss to build a dream on
And my imagination
Will thrive upon that kiss
Mmm, sweetheart
I ask no more than this
A kiss to build a dream on
 Mmm
 Give me a kiss before you leave me
And my imagination
 Will feed my hungry heart
 Ooh, leave me one thing before we part
A kiss to build a dream on
 When I'm alone
 With my fancies
I'll be with you
 Weaving romances
Making believe they're
I'm horny, horny, horny, horny, I'm
- So horny 
- Oh, Mother of God, what's happening?
I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny, I'm
So horny
I'm horny, horny, horny tonight
Kieran. You've wiped me bloody tape.
- It's the wrong button.
- I know that!
- That was never your tape. That was mine.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Push. It's that one there?
Aw, shite!
Sorry, Father.
But really... bloody shite.
You know something,
Kieran? You... and you too, Father... you're all wrong.
"Have faith"?
"Go for it"? Why?
I'm no poet or... or painter or musician... and I can't...
I don't know how to...
I am a sheep farmer, for God's sake.
Only, I don't want you thinking... that when I'm up there keeping me thoughts to meself... that I don't feel... for Kate... that I don't feel.
'Cause I do.
God.
- Nice?
- Yeah. Nice.
Not too uncomfortable, huh?
Comfort and strength, Ollie.
That's a Massey for you.
She understands me, and she understands tractors.
Thank you, God!
Great song.
- Hello, Father.
- How are you?
Thank you so much.
Hi there.
- Hey!
- He's cute, isn't he?
That one says
"Kilvara. "
Should we hit that road?
Are you gonna get on or what?
This is Report 105 from Xeno
Archaeological Expedition, Team Seven.
Documentation Officer
Kate Carson reporting.
The past two months of survey and research
have resulted in the discovery of a vast, tomb-like complex.
This structure was unmentioned in any report
made by the previous and abandoned expedition to this planet.
Entry to the tomb has now been made,
and examination of the inner chambers may reveal
vital information about the extinction
of the previous race that inhabited this planet.
Despite the planet's two suns,
the surface temperature remains a constant 89 degrees below zero.
However, life-support systems and electrical installations
in the underground headquarters are fully operational.
Safety factor: 60 per cent.
Conditions:
tolerable.
Wait a minute.
Will you take a look at that?
Dean, shine your torch over here for a minute.
This is terrific.
Looks like there's another section through here.
Listen, Dean, don't wander off too far.
No, don't worry, I won't.
- I wanna be able to hear you at all times.
- Yeah, I'll keep in touch.
- Hey, this looks interesting.
- Dean, what have you found?
- Dean?
- Some kind of wall carving.
Can you read it?
Can you make it out?
Means nothing to me.
Can you recognise anything on it at all?
No. We'll have to get Mitch to figure this one out.
Well, listen, don't...
don't stay there too long.
Come back, and we'll have it checked later. Come back now.
- There's something here...
- Dean!
Ricky?
Dean, can you hear me?
Dean, what have you found?
Ricky?
Ricky, can you hear me?
- Yeah, what's the matter?
- Ricky...
Move it!
- Hang on.
- How long have we got?
I don't know.
Can you hear me, Ricky?
Can you hear me, Ricky?
- I'll take him. Come on.
- Sandy, get his legs up.
- Okay, get him up. Come on.
- Come on, Sandy, let's go.
Easy.
Okay, Sharon, come on, move it.
What happened?
What about Dean?
- I don't know.
- Is there much damage?
One sector's knocked out out there.
Okay, you'd better get back there, too, and see what you can do.
The voice communicators don't work in there.
Gary, this is Holly. Respond.
Gary, will you answer me?
Yes, what is it?
Did you check the communicators in the suits like you were supposed to?
I did.
Well, we've had a problem with the tomb,
and the communicators are all dead.
It sounds to me like a frequency block.
Damn it, that can't be right.
Get your ass up here on the double.
I want to know why we have this communications problem.
"Get your ass up here on the double."
I know what I'd like to do with her arse.
- How is he?
Okay, let's get his suit off, please.
How is he?
- What's that in his hand?
- No, don't.
- Get me an isolation unit. Come on.
- What is it?
Holly, give me half an hour, then you can talk to him.
Okay.
I want to know what kind of crystals these are.
- I'll run some tests.
- Okay.
This is Xeno Sub-satellite
Research Team Seven,
Archaeology Team Documentation Officer conducting Interview... 273 with Commander Holly McKay.
Holly, what can you disclose about this accident?
We have no idea what caused the explosion.
Our photographer,
Ricky Williams, was there, and narrowly escaped serious injury.
Dean White has yet to be located.
- But does this mean we have to extend?
- There's no way we can extend.
If we miss the pick-up, there's no telling how long it'll be before Xeno can slot us in again.
- That's all I can say for the moment.
- Well, thank you.
Holly? We've got Dean.
Is he dead?
Technically, he's still alive.
Anything you can do?
I've done everything I can.
I'll just keep him alive until we get him back.
Holly, we must get back into that tomb.
That may prove unfeasible.
Mitch has a theory that the planet was ruled by twins.
That's right.
The inscriptions indicate a very interesting belief in mythology.
Now, everything seemed to happen in pairs.
I've never come across anything like it.
The planet has two suns. Maybe that's the reason for the duplication?
You know, the creation of the previous race fascinates me.
There seems to be a chemical intelligence present.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I want to know what caused that explosion first.
Look, we're not gonna change our departure time, but Mitch is right.
I mean, this obviously needs to be investigated.
Sharon, do you have any more information about those crystals?
Well, I've only just started the tests, but there seems to be some sort of... energy force surrounding the crystals.
Look, this team isn't prepared for the contingencies we're facing now.
If it was up to me,
I'd say abandon and get taking off.
But it could be years before anybody was sent back here. Perhaps never.
All our work would be wasted.
Listen, I'm not feeling too hot.
I think I'd better get some rest.
Take care of yourself, Rick.
There's still the question of what caused the explosion.
I think we'll leave it for someone else to find out.
Unknown energy fields are beyond the range of this team.
Barbra, let's tell Xeno to take us off, please.
Can't for 72 hours. They're in orbit.
Well, as soon as you can, then.
In the meantime,
I don't want anyone going near that site without my direct permission.
- Mm-hmm?
- Gail here.
Sorry to bother you, Mark,
but I'm getting an electrical disturbance coming from the lab.
- Right, I'll hurry down there and check it.
- Okay.
- Gail?
- Yes?
Would you do me a favour?
Er... would you ask Sandy to meet me down there?
- Yes, okay.
- Okay, thanks a lot.
Hello.
I love you.
Mmm. I love you, too.
What's the matter with the lights?
I don't know, but I think it's kinda great.
Erm...
What exactly have you discovered from the inscriptions inside the tomb?
I found some very disturbing elements which, at the moment,
I don't fully understand.
Now, the previous inhabitants were obviously highly intelligent, but there seems to be a form of, er... self-destruction...
Mitch, sorry. Er, Kate...
Holly wants to have some photographic evidence of the damage caused by the explosion.
Well, what's that got to do with me?
You and I have been assigned to do it.
Yesterday, Holly said she didn't want anyone to go out there.
Yep, that's more like it.
We should get some evidence.
Do you want to take some photographs, honey?
Oh, I don't know.
I'll be glad when we go home.
Yes, I know what you mean.
Hey, Ricky.
Well, what's wrong?
Hey, what are you doing?
- I've got to find Dean!
- Ricky, come here.
- What's up with you?
- Get out of my way!
Ricky, it's all right. It's all right.
Listen, Ricky.
Listen to me, Dean's not in there.
Let go. Let go!
No!
Stop it!
See to him.
Ricky!
Ricky!
Hey, Ricky.
- Are you okay?
- No, no, no, let's go.
What's down there?
- Where does it lead to?
- I don't know but I'm gonna find out.
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Where does it go?
- The track.
- I'll check the other route.
- We'll get back to the monitors.
Get to Operations, Barbra.
Oh, no!
He's left that outer door open.
Well, he can't stay out there for long.
Gary, do you see him?
Yes, I can.
He's just wandering around, as if he's lost his sense of direction.
I've lost him, Holly.
Ricky?
Gail!
Get over here, quickly!
I... can't.
I can't, Holly, my foot's stuck.
Gary, any way to override the lock on this door?
I'm not sure. I'll get Barbra to check the main computer.
If Gary can get that inner door open, you could get out there, right?
- That's right.
- Okay. Get this off.
- How long have we got?
- Only two or three minutes, maybe.
- Let's do it slow. Come on. That's it.
- There must be a way of overriding that lock.
Gail, you must get here quickly.
We need to close the airlock.
My thermal unit's gone.
Okay, Gail? Gail.
This is Gary. Now, listen to me.
You must connect the blue and yellow leads.
Repeat, connect the blue and yellow leads.
That will bypass the thermostat.
We can't get to you, Gail.
You have to do it yourself.
Come on, Gail.
Oh, Gary...
I can't do it.
You've got to help me.
I can't help you, Gail.
You've got to help yourself.
The blue and yellow leads.
Oh, Christ, I'm freezing.
Gary, her body temperature's dropped.
Connect the leads, Gail!
- Bloody gloves!
- Down to 36.5.
Gary, I can't do it!
"Can't" is a word
I don't understand.
Now do it, Gail!
You can't give up now.
- Oh, Gary,
I'm gonna die out here.
- She'll go into hypothermia at this rate.
- I can't help you, sweetheart.
- It's up to you.
- Help me, Gary.
35.6.
35.5.
You must do it, Gail. Connect the wires.
The blue and the yellow.
Gail! Listen to me!
She'll go unconscious any minute.
Gail!
No, Gail. Gail!
Reconnect the life-support!
Reconnect the life-support!
- Gail!
This is Gary. Listen to me, Gail.
Gail. Gail!
Bypass the thermostat, woman!
Damn you, woman!
Kate, come here and shut the door.
Oh...
Kate, come over here.
That's an order!
Oh...
Ricky, out of my way.
Ricky, get out of my way.
Ricky!
Well, what would you have done?
You didn't see him in that tomb. He was...
Then I just...
I...
- I just freaked.
- Did you have to kill him?
It's very easy for you to talk here in the operations room.
He was out of his mind.
That outer door was open.
What would've happened if he'd opened the inner one?
Look, any of you could've found yourself in the same situation.
What would you have done?
All right, Kate. All right.
Calm down.
What do you make of Ricky's behaviour?
Well, he was obviously exposed to something out there.
What it is, I've got no idea.
There is a chance it has something to do with the crystals.
- Ah, so a contamination problem?
- No, not necessarily.
You see, the crystals have been in the station about 24 hours, but Ricky was showing symptoms long before that.
No, I think whatever it is must break the skin, as in Ricky's case, or at least have some form of close physical contact.
My tests don't show any organic matter.
What do you think they could contain?
Well, we're gonna have to get samples of that stuff, because people are gonna want to look at it.
Holly, surely there's no obligation to continue with any of this?
I know, Kate, but it's my job.
You want to be careful with that, Mitch.
Yeah.
You know, there's something about these crystals that we just haven't discovered yet.
Now... their energy must have something to do with a life source.
Do you mean there might be something out there feeding on them?
- We'll lose audio here.
- Okay. Stay close, huh?
Don't worry, I will.
Sandy! Sandy!
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.
Sh-sh-ssh. Sandy, Sandy.
Come on.
Okay, that's enough.
Come on. She's calming down.
What happened out there?
We shouldn't have brought him in here.
- Sharon, I have to examine him.
- No!
Give her one of your shots, and clear her head.
Sandy, do you hear me?
- She's in no condition to talk.
- I'll put her in condition.
She needs to rest.
Sandy, we have to know what's out there.
Try, Sandy.
- Try.
- Leave her alone.
She can't hear you.
Listen, Sandy's in a deep trauma.
No...
I think she's been literally scared out of her senses.
No...
How do you feel?
- Thirsty.
- I'll get you a drink.
- You got any pain?
- No.
Thanks.
- I feel sick.
- Hang on.
Come on.
Back we go.
Get your legs up.
- Sandy, I want you to take these.
- Oh, I couldn't.
- Does that arm hurt?
- Yes.
- You gave me an injection, didn't you?
- Yes, I did, but in the other arm.
- Let's have a look.
- Ooh.
Come on, Sandy, come on.
It's all right. Come on, come on, back you come.
There we are, it's all right.
It's all right.
Now listen, Sandy, we're going to give you a thorough examination, hmm?
Holly?
Yes, Karl?
Problem?
- Yes, it's Sandy.
- Oh, how is she?
Well, she's fine as long as
I keep her sedated.
But do you remember the marks
I found on Ricky's hand?
- Yes?
- She has one on her arm.
- Oh, Christ.
- Yeah, and that's not all.
As you know, Holly, I perform certain prescribed medical duties...
- What are you getting at?
- Including quarterly injections to restrict...
- Are you trying to tell me she's pregnant?
- Two months.
That can't be.
We had our injection the same time.
Please! No!
No! No!
Jesus.
Now we'll never know what happened.
That's the end of our project.
All right, what's
Xeno's position, Barbra?
We should be able to make contact in six hours.
Well, then all we can do is wait.
Mm...
Ah...
Hi. Feeling better?
I tell you, I can't wait to go home.
Don't know about you but I've had this mission.
Don't know what's going on but whatever it is, it's weird.
I agree with Kate completely.
We should abandon and go home.
Can't wait to go home.
Go away.
Go away!
I said, go away!
Holly, go away!
Go away!
- Hey, there's Sandy.
- What are they up to?
Sandy?
Mmm...
Ah!
Ow.
Ooh.
Pay attention, please.
Secure all stations.
Remain just where you are.
Secure all doors.
Do not admit anyone.
Do not admit any personnel.
- Mark?
- Yeah, Holly?
- Mark?
- What's going on?
Sandy's killed Barbra.
- What are you talking about?
- Listen, she's killed Barbra.
- I don't understand this.
- No time to explain.
You gotta reach Sharon right now.
- Well, where's Sharon?
- In her quarters, I hope.
Mark, please be careful.
- Who is it?
- It's Mark.
- What do you want?
- Open the door.
No.
Hey, quit screwing around, Sharon, and open the door.
We've all had instructions to keep our doors locked.
Sharon, I'm ordering you to open this door.
My instructions came from Holly.
Well, get Holly on the damn communicator, then!
Control?
- I've got Mark outside the door, and...
- Well, open it!
Come on, Sharon.
- Are you there?
- Yeah. Hello?
- Mark, you with Sharon?
- Yeah, I'm here, she's here.
Bring her up here now.
No, no, no...
- Go to the mess hall first.
- What for?
We may need food.
Okay.
- Be careful.
- Yup.
- What's going on?
- Come on, I'll tell you later.
Number three scanner's gone dead.
Damn it, four's gone now.
At least she's nowhere near those two.
What's that?
I don't know. Come on.
I'll take that.
Can't you fix it?
I'm trying, Holly, I'm trying.
Is there something wrong with the videos, Gary?
You've got it. We've lost six.
- Did Sandy do that?
- Yes, she did.
Why would she knock out the videos?
I'll take care of this, Gary.
That was a smart idea.
Switch on emergency.
Where's Kate?
Kate?
- She's very strong!
- What weapons have you got?
We've got to stop her, not hurt her, Kate.
There's only one way to stop her, and that is to kill her.
What do you suggest?
Do you know anything about that, Kate?
Explosives.
You wouldn't know where to detonate.
With the videos out, she could be anywhere.
- Unless you were on the spot.
- We could use the touch burner.
- What's that?
- Used for heat sealing.
Burn right through her brain.
- What do you suggest?
- Keeping her alive!
He's the doctor.
Ask him how to keep her alive.
- I could inject her with a drug.
- Shall I hold her arm while you do it?
She's pregnant, Kate.
That'll look great on the report.
"The team were terrorised by an expectant mother."
She's blowing up the place.
Transmitter's out.
She's thinking fast.
- What about Xeno?
- We're out of contact.
- Someone help me.
- Sandy?
She's in the exercise room.
- Holly, I'm going to her.
- Don't be a fool, Karl.
Holly, I'm a doctor, and she's in pain.
- She might have gotten hurt in that...
- I'll decide who goes!
Well?
If I can restrain her with the burner, can you sedate her?
I'll get my things.
- Where's the touch burner?
- Preparation chamber.
- Stay here, Gary, please.
- Yes, sir.
What's happening to me?
Help me.
Someone, please.
Help... please.
Come on.
It's all right, Sandy, it's all right. Come on.
- It's all right.
- Now, Sandy...
Now come on, take it easy.
I'm here, okay? Just relax.
Give me your hand. That's it.
- Now take it easy, come on.
- Ssh.
- That's right. Now...
- It's okay.
- Come on now, just relax.
- Don't worry.
Take it easy, that's it.
- Don't worry. It's all right.
- Hold her, Sharon.
- Just relax, come on.
- It's all right.
It's not going to...
No!
Come here, Sandy. Come on.
Come on!
- You've got to keep steady, Karl.
- Holly!
- Out of my way!
- Holly!
No! No!
No!
Sharon! Help me!
Sharon! Sharon!
Sharon!
No! No!
Help!
Watch it, Mark.
Okay, come on, Sharon.
Watch your leg.
Put your arm around me.
- Please, help me.
- Are you okay?
Come on.
Come on. Kate?
Get her to the chair.
Have you seen her?
- What is it?
- It's her leg.
Let me have a look.
Where are the others?
- Come on, it's all right.
- Gary, I don't know.
She'll be okay, it's not broken.
How are we gonna stop this?
Well, if we can get to the space preparation chamber, we've still got picks there.
- It's no good.
- Look, we've got to try something.
- There are chainsaws.
- She's too strong.
You can't get away from me, you know.
It doesn't matter what you do, you'll have to come out sometime.
There's no other way.
So why don't you... all just come out now?
Mark?
Mark.
I'm waiting for you.
This is our chance.
For you.
You needn't be like the others.
What do you think?
You keep her occupied, we'll get the equipment.
Why don't you just... open the door?
It would be so easy.
Mark?
Mark.
I'm waiting for you.
Mark?
I'm waiting for you.
Our best bet's the derelict passages.
She won't look for us there.
Mark!
Mark, I'm waiting for you!
Mark!
Please, help me!
Sandy?
Sandy, can you hear me?
Sandy?
Mark...
I need you.
Sandy...
I promise you, I'll help you.
I promise you.
Can you hear me?
Oh!
Kate!
What was that?
Mark?
- No...
- Kate! Quiet, woman.
Sa...
Sandy?
- Sandy?
- You can't escape me.
Is that out?
Sandy?
- Is that off?
- I don't know.
Sandy?
Quickly, let's get out of here.
Oh!
Oh!
Kate!
Move, woman!
Ohh...
- Mark?
- Yeah, Gary. You all right?
Where are you?
Outside the airlock.
What the hell are you doing out there?
She chased me out.
I'm okay, but I don't know how long I can stay out here.
Is your air system functioning?
It's fine.
You worry about yourself, Harvard.
- Oh, no.
- Gary, what's the matter?
She's... she's breathing the atmosphere.
She's... she's what?
Oh, no.
Gary! Gary!
Help me.
Help me.
Gary!
Gary?
He's here with me, Mark.
Damn it! We're dead!
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill her.
I am going to kill her. No!
- Get those lights... get the lights on!
- Don't leave us.
No! No!
No!
No! No!
Mark!
- Kate, what the hell are you...?
- Jesus, what have you got in there?
- Come on, Kate!
- In there.
All right, Kate, get her in here.
Can you carry...?
I'll get the door. Let her go...
Over there.
- She's gonna come looking for them.
- That's right.
Lock the door.
Lock it, Sharon.
No!
Ah...
Ahhh!
Mark!
Sharon?
Sharon?

SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
THE INHERITORS
One time the farmer was drunk.
He said:
Today is a joyous day, the servants are to sing me songs.
And then he started crying... and afterwards he gave each of us a whole gulden.
Even though he was a mean and stingy man.
That was the only really strange thing... that I ever experienced here, on the farm, and I had already been there a couple of months.
Until the night... the strange woman came and sat on Lukas' bed.
I think...
I knew right then... that there was something odd about that, and that it was just the first of more odd things to come...
Sometimes it's like that:
You can tell it's not about to stop... and that even more is about to happen.
Likewise, when someone dies, a lot of times in the end there's another death.
You are aware... that you're committing a terrible sin... if you conceal anything, right, Reverend?
Didn't see or hear anything?
Who's the foreman here?
Was there a fight, yesterday?
A visitor perhaps?
We...
- What?
Speak up!
We were in the cowshed until late, then we went to bed.
Without any supper because the farmer said we did a bad job.
It's as if he was looking for something, the murderer...
"Last will and testament.
To be read aloud in front of everyone when I'm dead."
Keep working until all is settled, is that clear, foreman?
Nobody spoke a word that day.
But that's the way it was anyway.
If you said more than five words, they said... you were a good-for-nothing blabber mouth.
I never got used to that.
That's why I kept going back to the city.
With the police... keep your mouth shut unless you're asked.
Don't take everything that bastard dishes out.
Sometimes... when I was in the cowshed,
I would start talking to a cow.
I know it's dumb.
But it just shows... that for me it was really a problem... that nobody talked to anybody.
Let me through.
Jesus Christ!
Somebody stumbled across Rosalind.
She was just sitting there.
That her name was Rosalind and that she was indeed involved... only old Nane knew any of this at the time, but, of course, she didn't say a word.
Were you always a peasant?
I've done other work occasionally.
You could say
I was born here on the farm.
Old Nane found me, out back, by the cowshed door.
What's it like somewhere else, in the city?
A poor wretch... has a hard life everywhere.
That's why... if I don't get work,
I'm going to America.
You can get land there real easy.
You want to come too?
To America?
That's a long way.
We'll have to get an early morning start!
Listen:
That's how they say it in America.
What does that mean?
Severin!
Tell me!
Not that he was dumb, but I don't think...
Lukas ever really thought about anything in his life.
He simply did things.
That's why he could be so happy-go-lucky all the time.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
And he made love to the peasant girls, especially to Emmy, but actually, he chased after all the girls in the village.
"If it gets hard on me, there's got to be a reason for it," he would say.
Somebody just died and you want to...
A dead man can't give orders anymore.
Just because he's dead doesn't mean we have to go hungry.
I say when we eat now.
Now.
Foreman, I...
No talking when we're eating.
Lukas, Severin!
Afterwards, you fix the gate.
Emmy, you wash my clothes!
Good riddance to him.
At least say who you are!
But she didn't say anything, not a word, and it made the policeman furious.
Because he'd never had a mysterious murder before.
The girl in the front, she likes me, I think.
Look, Reverend, the farm is worth 40,000 maximum!
We'll give the church 30,000 and you can have the Steingrund orchard.
The farmers had already divvied up the inheritance... because they figured, without a descendant... it would all go to the church.
Hey, foundling!
Hurry up!
Silence!
I want silence!
"Now that I'm dead... and our Lord has spared me children and relatives,
I hereby bequeath to the... following persons that which they deserve:
Firstly, the reverend, for he is as good a Christian... as good a Christian as my ass is divine:
A wagonload of cow dung..."
"Is what he inherits" should be added.
"Secondly, farmer Danninger, a kick in the ass for..."
I'm only reading what it says,
"...for nobody would dare kill him, even if it was my dying wish.
Thirdly, foreman, for he is a mean bastard who can't find a woman,
Lukas, for he is a smart ass and a lazybones,
Severin, the outsider who talks to the cows, old Nane, for her breath is as malodorous as a pile of manure,
Gertrude, the scolding harpy... and the stable boy who's not quite right upstairs,
Sepp whose head is full of straw,
Lisbeth and Liesl not much brighter,
...and Emmy who gave everyone a piece but me..."
Silence!
"They get the farm, the land, the livestock and everything in the house... to manage jointly, and I hope they beat each other to death... when they fight over it."
Silence! Silence, for heaven's sake!
"Fourthly, my neighbors, noble sirs, you can all kiss my ass.
And now I'm going to hell, good-day and amen."
The farm belongs to us now!
Foreman,
Come here!
A crazy old bastard, wasn't he...
Yeah...
- C'mon,
Have some schnapps with me... and let's have a little talk.
And everyone thought it would be annulled, on account of the likes of that had never happened before, and wouldn't now either.
That's how people think in the country.
WHO KNOWS
THIS WOMAN?
And Emmy went and got her bastard son, he lived with foster parents... because a peasant girl can't have a child... that will keep her from doing her work.
Danninger will pay 10,000 schillings, that's 1,000 in cash for each of us, and he promises work on his farm to able bodies.
That's a good deal and I already shook on it.
Tomorrow we go and sign.
If Danninger says 10, he'll pay 20, too,
'cause it's worth 30,000.
It's settled, I said.
Ten thousand is a good price,
Danninger said so.
The mother of a bastard doesn't know any better.
The farmer's dead, but the peasants can keep working.
I'm buying a walking stick with a silver knob, and a hat, round and tall...
A top hat?
Nane! What are you buying with your money?
Emmy, did you hear?
I'm buying a top hat!
I never had anything, so I don't need anything now.
Or maybe I do, an umbrella, so I don't get wet when it rains.
We have to be careful now... and we can't make any mistakes.
Settled, settled, settled... and a house and a woman... for the peasant...
No, enough.
Should I buy you something with my money, too?
Fine silk stockings... or...
I'm not selling.
How come?
A life of working for someone else, letting men hump you, then just dying somewhere:
It doesn't make sense!
Don't you understand?!
Lukas! We can be farmers, now!
But... a peasant can't be...
What?
You can work for someone else, but not for yourself?
Yeah, but...
Afraid to try?
Wait!
I don't want to sell.
No talking I said.
But we...
Listen foreman, we're all hard workers.
Why shouldn't we work for oursel...
We're selling to Danninger, and that's that.
Why work a lifetime for someone else, someone who doesn't pay enough?
Then you get chased off like a dog... when you're old and can't work anymore!
Don't you understand?
The farm belongs to us now!
We don't have to sell!
Didn't you hear what I said,
Danninger gets it, it's already settled.
Lukas is right.
When a peasant tries to become a farmer... disaster becomes of it!
- Says the farmer.
Kiss my ass.
- Look, foreman...
I'm the farmer, and I own one tenth of every animal and every pasture.
It's already settled!
I'm the farmer and I own one tenth of every animal and every pasture.
It's settled!
Stop it!
Tell them who's boss!
Stop it!!
It's a sin for us to want to be farmers.
I'm staying with my foundling.
I have to.
It will end in disaster.
Foreman!
Get off of our farm!
A curse on you, foundling!
And the rest of you, a curse on you, too!
No one can beat me up anymore, right?
From now on, nobody can beat me up?!
What...
It's mine now!
What...
I don't think I really understood until now... that I'm a real farmer who owns something!
And if anyone in the whole world, tries to tell me what to do,
I'll just say:
Yeah, but...
From now on this is my house!
My house!
Our house.
And we thought... no one could ever take that away from us.
Idiot!
I did everything, but... things worked out differently.
He wants to be a farmer, the foundling and his womenfolk...
They'll probably have to sell anyway... since they don't have 3,000 schillings to pay out our shares.
Pay...
Listen you idiot, listen real good.
Naturally they won't be able to pay.
You understand?
What if we choose to claim it...
Can you do it with no one giving orders?
Yes, we'll manage.
We need your signatures in the land record.
Come down to the local recording office.
All 7?
- I guess you're... one-seventh farmers.
Hey, foundling, how you going to sign your name?
What, I...
- Thumbprint?
You do know which one's the thumb?
Index finger... middle finger...
But I know how to...
He knows how all right, with four women...
And you, foreman? Forgotten how?
Don't get cocky, woman.
It takes more than sleeping around or not having a home to be a farmer.
What's so special about a farmer?
A farmer is a farmer, that's all.
Just like women aren't men and jackasses aren't horses.
He who goes against the will of God... shall meet with disaster.
And God told you what he wants,
Danninger?
God wants things the way they are and always have been.
Maybe God is getting a little bored just now...
Let's forgive and forget.
Beware lest you sin.
Whore.
The farmers got angry... and they didn't forgive us, and they probably thought to themselves:
We'll get them back for that, the foundling and that shameless hussy.
Forgive me God!
Index finger.
You are like a tower,
No foe has ever taken,
No storm can make me cower,
Beside you I'm unshaken.
In heaven I am safe,
Forever near my King,
Who shelters this poor waif,
Beneath His beating wing.
A farmer from Viechtwang stated for record that... the doctor had told Rosalind... she would die soon on account of her heart.
Then she left without saying goodbye, and that same night she killed Hillinger.
Don't be so chicken...
Yeah, all right...
What a mess!
It was the murderess.
So many things!
A trousseau...
Like what elegant ladies with hats have.
Nane!
We're going into his room!
Come on!
I'm not going in there, never again, not in there.
Why, did he...
I never had anything... of my own, my whole life long.
Except for when I found the boy.
Lukas?
At first...
Hillinger didn't want to let me keep him.
I had to pay for it.
Twice a week he made me go up to his room.
Then I started eating garlic so he'd get disgusted.
Now Hillinger is dead and the boy is the farmer.
Liesl! Come here now!
It's so soft...
This is a nice room!
I wouldn't mind... and Severin, too, if he wants...
Nobody's sleeping in here ever again.
Today is Sunday.
The day of rest for a farmer, all he does is smoke his pipe and drink coffee.
Make your own coffee.
I'm a farmer myself.
Now what?
Nothing. This is free time.
Nane, what are you doing...?
Leave it!
You're not allowed to work!
It's free time now.
Oh, shush.
Lisbeth?
You think we'll always have to do free time?
I don't know.
Maybe next week we can go for a walk instead.
I found it upstairs in Hillinger's room, it's a...
Gramophone.
- It's a Gramophone!
What's he singing?
- American.
When the old elephant died, the circus people went to the city for a new one.
And then evening came... and they just happened to ask us... if they could spend the night.
We never even thought... that it was an unusually unusual thing:
For example, if you have a dream, you don't think anything of it... when an elephant appears.
And Lisbeth got herself pregnant... because she figured she'd never get herself another elephant keeper.
But Lisbeth really was foolish.
My name is Rosalind.
I was one of Hillinger's peasants.
That was twenty years ago.
And soon it had made the rounds, and everyone remembered... what happened back then.
Rosalind was the most beautiful girl in the whole valley.
Everyone was after her, and especially Hillinger.
Nobody was good enough for her.
She was proud and she used to laugh... and not let anyone have her.
Then one night,
Hillinger took her by force.
I heard her screaming... and I plugged my ears... because she was my dearest friend and there was nothing I could do.
The next day she went to the police and reported him.
Herr Hillinger, Franz, address 362 Kirchham, forced me to have intercourse with him and used violence...
Said she didn't want it... and that the farmer was rough with her...
Imagine: Just like that!
A peasant girl reporting the farmer!
Before it was brought before court,
Hillinger hid a brooch in Rosalind's trunk... and said... that she had stolen it.
She did steal it, the whore.
Otherwise she wouldn't have run away.
She was gone for half a year, or maybe more.
She fled in the face of injustice.
Then they finally caught her.
And put her in prison.
It didn't take a long trial after that!
It was a grave injustice.
Fifteen years... at Garsten Prison, sentence effective immediately.
An injustice.
A grave injustice.
And when the doctor said
I was going to die,
I went and killed him.
She killed him and that was just.
And she took the brooch... because she'd paid dearly for it back then.
Now they're going to hang her, but at least it won't be for nothing, this time.
What old Nane told us then still wasn't the whole truth, and Rosalind told even less.
There was unrest in the valley back then:
When the farmers testified for Hillinger, the peasants were angry, they got uppity.
They're getting uppity again.
Those one-seventh farmers are trouble.
A peasant can't be a farmer.
Something has to be done.
Something shall be done...
"A" is for apple.
"B" is for... dang, how did "B" go again?
Breasts!
Why didn't you go to school?
No, without the dots...
The farmer didn't let me go too much.
Because of work and all.
I'm dumb, aren't I?
You're dumb... that you were born poor.
Will you make me smart?
Now that I am a farmer: Why do I have to go to market myself and on foot?
Stop talking nonsense.
In the name of... blah, blah... too long...
I hereby decree:
The court-appointed commission has assessed... the Hillinger farmstead, 362 Kirchham, including land and property, all livestock and items therein to be worth...
40,000 schillings...
What?! Forty thousand?
The value of one inheritance share is 4,000 schillings...
Payable in four months time,
September 22.
Failure shall result in execution sale.
Period.
I know who's behind this...
You lousy swindlers!
They looked at us as if...
But we sold more.
Have you counted it?
And it all belongs to us alone?
We won't throw it into Hillinger's grave for him.
Are you crazy?
We've got to save every coin, and you...
But I'm a farmer now... and... this is my money now!
Is not!
- Is so!
Is not!
- Is so!
Don't you ever do that again!
Do you understand! Never!
Is it right for them...
It's all just as much Lisbeth's as it is yours.
Do you think I'm doing all this to have a young farmer instead of an old one?
But someone has to...
What?
Give orders?
And who says that someone is you?
I talked it over with Severin, and...
And you voted on it, the two of you?!
Do you want to vote on who's boss? Do you?
Florian, come here.
Lisbeth! Liesl!
Forgive me.
And now put the stupid hat away.
She... cried... with desire.
She... took... his... gigantic... pe... nis.
What was that again?
Penis. That's what you've got for a brain.
I'm educating myself.
Reading... geography, that kind of thing...
We have to pay 12,000 in four months' time.
We found 5,460 in Hillinger's things, we girls have 837 all together.
How much do you have?
But I wanted to...
- And you?
That makes...
We need another 5,500.
More or less.
We're not selling any land.
And if we sell a few cows...
Five cows, that's all we can spare.
That makes... if we bargain well,
That still leaves 3,500.
We'll never come up with that.
- Just have to work hard.
The work was always hard, but during those months we all worked twice as hard, even though that wasn't actually possible.
During the day, we men went to Deutenham... and worked in the foundry.
And the women did the field chores alone.
Lukas and I earned fifteen schillings between the two of us... because we were the hardest workers there.
What were you telling them?
What it's like to be a one-seventh farmer.
It's not easy.
It's funny: Used to be nobody would listen to me when I talked.
You didn't have anything to say before.
Lisbeth! You come here right now when I say so!
And then in the evening there was all the work... around the farmyard.
Please, please, please come here right now!
"C" is for clover, cow, ca-ca.
He said I could join the circus if I wanted...
I never said...
- Oh, stop it...
I never said anyone...
Stop it...
Why can't you do what I want, just once?!
Because I'd rather do what I want!
But then again:
There were plenty of fights, that's something one can't forget.
I want more soup.
And the stable boy spoke, where everyone had always thought he was mute or... an idiot.
I don't know, no one was there anymore when we found the cow lying there dead.
But it can only be that Danninger over there.
No one ever arrests that Danninger.
None of you has the guts.
A lot of mean things happened.
Once two grown men beat up the stable boy.
That's what kind of scoundrels they were.
Meanwhile, Emmy rearranged the cows in the shed... put them the way they liked one another, as opposed to the way they used to be, in alphabetical order.
The cows started producing more milk after that.
That was interesting, actually.
And other good things happened, too:
Sometimes the peasants from other farms came over and helped.
For no reason.
And they did it secretly because the farmers didn't want them to.
It's raining, it's pouring...
I hope it does the harvest good.
Don't, leave me alone...
What's wrong?
I don't want to. Not now.
You never want to anymore.
Don't you like me anymore?
Are you something better now?
Yes, I'm something better.
Before nothing mattered...
I don't want to.
Either you like someone, or you don't.
What's wrong?
Y'know, as a peasant you were told what to do, work, eat, sleep.
But now everything is so complicated.
Maybe it's that... before, we had nothing, and nothing to lose either.
And besides, nobody likes me anymore...
Nobody wants you bossing them around is all.
And what if I'm right!
Today with the yoke and the oxen...
You still don't have the right to call Liesl a "toad girl."
Scoot over!
If nobody likes me anymore,
I can't handle that.
I like all of you.
And especially Emmy.
This is Frau Hedwig Grabner from the Brandner Farm.
She went up to her farmer... and asked for the money he owed her.
Louis and Sophie.
They got married, even though Farmer Obermeier refused to let them.
When Farmer Pucher wouldn't pay
Herta and Sigrid higher wages, they left to go work in the factory.
So the farmers decided... that the one-seventh farmers were responsible for the unrest, and that all this had to stop.
And the reverend said... that we were living in sin and corruption.
Wonder where he got that idea!
So we just stopped going to church, except for old Nane because she was afraid of going to hell.
And one time it snowed, even though it wasn't even October.
Everyone thought:
That's a sign from the Almighty.
I can guess who's...
Look what I found in my things.
You found it?
I don't know either...
It's so pretty...
The brooch...
THE brooch?
The one Rosalind...?
- The murderess' brooch...
But why...?
- That night,
I saw Rosalind sitting on your bed...
What?!
...and she was singing a lullaby, like you sing to your children...
It's gold.
If we sell it, maybe we can keep the cows.
And that's how we were able to pay with one week to spare.
And we were all mighty proud.
Seven? Can't do that.
What if we just write one name and then an "et" dot "al" dot?
"And others"?
No, attach a piece of paper with enough room on it.
Filgrater, Emilie.
Go ahead and write it!
Candlemas, Lukas.
- Slow down.
Candlemas?
What?
You know, they...!
- That's when they found you?!
That's fine; sounds better than Ascension.
Do women have to be silly even at the recording office?!
Foreman and the other two got their money, and we had a photograph taken.
You'll see, a one-seventh farmer will never find a husband.
You going to buy another round, now that you're rich?
A beer! This instant!
Here you go, a beer!
This instant!
And when's the execution?
Next week they're transferring her to Salzburg... after that sometime.
Strange woman, that one.
At the trial she said,
"Marital status: Single, one child," and then,
"a big and handsome one, a farmer."
What's that supposed to mean?
That's all she said.
Except: "Guilty? Yes."
Foundling,
Come over here!
Why are you dancing with your peasants?
I thought you were the farmer!?
All of us are the farmer now.
You... and Severin... and the womenfolk... and the pigs, too?
And who's the boss? When you work, and just in general?
What the majority decides, we do...
- You vote?!
You have to let the womenfolk tell you what to do...
You do a lot of heavy pumping every night!
And your womenfolk, do they vote to see... who you get to screw first?
He who has a big mouth often has a small cock, right, foreman?!
Danninger, we have so much fun and still reap a bigger harvest than you... does your wife have this much fun when she's... working?
She's a woman... and a farmer.
Murder child...
C'mon let's go.
Emmy... did you really mean what you said earlier?
I said what I said.
I mean when you said... that a man with a big mouth has a little cock, and because I...
Oh Jesus... what an idiot!
Should we...
I mean...
No peasant attacks me, not me.
They're finished.
Finished.
It was a good year.
It was a hot summer with plenty of rain for good soil and a plentiful harvest.
And I thought a lot about Rosalind, the murderess... and about Emmy and Lukas.
And it got me a little scared... because there was so much fate involved... in such a short time period.
What are you going to do without your whores?
Murder child?
Murder child...
If you can't defend your farm, you're no farmer at all!
No one's ever beating me up again!
No one's ever beating me again.
But I just wanted...
Why "murder child"?
Come, boy, come.
We have to go.
It was self-defense.
Severin said if it's self-defense, they don't punish you...
Come boy, it's bedtime.
Listen, if all of you testify in court that it was self-defense...
Severin will go to the police and everything will be okay...
This cave... have you been here before?
I didn't even know...
Rosalind was the most beautiful of them all, always gay... and kind to everyone.
- What? Rosalind?
They were mad over her, everyone in the village, but she didn't want to.
And then Hillinger took her by force.
Here? But I thought...
And Rosalind... got a big belly after that.
But nobody knew.
A child? From Hillinger?
She hid up here for seven months... and then she gave birth.
And not until then did she let herself be put in prison, even though it was unjust.
When did it happen?
It was cold, the coldest winter... and it was a boy...
How many years ago?
It happened on Candlemas.
But then... Rosalind is my... and Hillinger is my...
Sleep now.
Early the next morning...
Lisbeth and Liesl went away, forever.
Much later I heard... that Lisbeth named her child "Lukas"... because she couldn't remember the elephant keeper's name, but that might have just been a rumor.
All right, back to the field.
But it's a fact that... in the months to follow so many peasant girls named their sons "Lukas"... that not even Lukas could have sired them all...
Get off my property!
Danninger put out a 200 gulden reward... for anyone who could catch Lukas.
Soon they were coming from all over, day-laborers and rogues...
'cause an honest peasant doesn't do that kind of thing:
Hunt a man.
Jesus, what an idiot.
They'll slaughter him like a pig if they catch him.
Everything will be okay.
Nobody but us testified that it was in self-defense... was what they told us, and they said that a murderer must be punished.
"F" is for free time, flirting... these fucking flies.
Take a walk, you two!
Why do you need another farm?
You own everything up here... and we...
- Go on, get out of here.
Is it money you want so you'll let us be...
Why come to me, Filgrater, Emilie?
If your... goes around beating people to death?
Look... Danninger, we don't want any handouts from anyone, we just want what's rightfully ours.
And we all worked very hard this year, and we had a good harvest, and everything is much better than when the farmer was still...
All I ask of you is that you spare Lukas his life...
You are a whore, I knew it all along.
She's a whore with no morals.
Unfortunately not.
I'd find it easier if she was...
They don't give a damn what Lukas did.
They just want everyone to see that people like us end miserably.
They'd love to crush him.
And our farm...
I'm not kidding.
What happened at Danninger's?
What did he do?
Nothing.
Everything's okay, okay, okay. I'm fine.
We just have to...
Lukas has to get out of here, as soon as possible.
Are you completely mad?
- Get down! The window!
I got kind of bored.
You go north, towards Deutenham.
Then you head for Passau and you keep going north... until you get to the sea.
And then you ask for a ship going to New York.
Do you understand?
Florian! Stop it!
You leave early tomorrow!
You promised!
Yeah, yeah! Due north all the way.
And don't you dare come back...
I almost forgot!
Because I was always so bored...
I couldn't remember the "B" at first, but then...
It's so I can find my way back, when they'll let me come back...
Do you think the people there are nice, in America?
What...
Can I stay with you tonight?
Here on this bed, this is where I was born.
Old Nane told me so.
It's like a cycle... where everything comes around... full circle.
Do you understand what I'm...?
Yes.
Now that Rosalind is my mother,
I have to see her again before I go to America.
What, but you can't possibly...
When it gets dark.
I have to.
He's up there!
Pickled pig's feet, forty fucking flies, flirting... free... assholes, assholes...
I'm Lukas.
Lukas... your son, because old Nane...
This is St. Luke.
Old Nane gave it to me, for my journey.
I'm setting you free and then...
Why?
But... you're my mother...
You're HIS son, too.
Hillinger's son.
Hurry up... get the others...
Well, I have to go now...
I'm off to America I guess...
Well, then, mother, until we meet again...
There he is, over there.
Follow him, you idiots!
Where is he?
We'll never catch him this way.
He knows the area, and people will be helping him.
Maybe we can...
The one-seventh farmers, we'll go there.
A farmer returns to his farm when there's danger.
A farmer?
And that night
Rosalind lay down and died.
Just like that.
Fouuundling!
Where are you?
Bitch! Dirty whore!
Lukas, no!
It's a trap!
You must not...
A farmer can't...
It's a crazed animal... that must be destroyed.
Not having been able to... at least shake his hand one last time... that was the worst part of all, at the time.
No bells tolled, and they wanted to bury him in secret during the week... so no one would be able to attend.
But everyone went in spite of that, all the peasants, and nobody fed the animals that day.
Emmy and Florian and myself, we left the farm after that.
But there were only three cows left anyway, and the stable boy was a hard worker and with old Nane...
And I fixed things with Danninger, too.
Maybe now the three of us will go to America.
I lived in my office and went home once in a while.
I knew he was hurting.
I couldn't do anything to help him except give him some money.
I couldn't do anything to help him except give him some money.
Why are you home so late?
I was busy.
Mom, I got paid today.
I'll leave it here.
Hello? Hold on.
Hongsheng, it's for you.
Who is it?
There's a TV series offering work.
Tell him I'm not here.
What's wrong with you?
Talk with him.
Hello?
Why are you calling?
What right do you have to call me?
Shut up, you're lying!
All your stuff is shit.
Listen, I quit acting, don't call me anymore.
It's OK if you don't want to be in the show.
Why did you treat him like that?
They deserve it.
How can you say that?
Everybody in this business knows you smoke drugs.
You're destroying your future.
I don't care, I'm not acting anymore.
Why don't you want to act?
It's all bullshit.
All the roles you played before were bullshit?
Yes.
We've acted all our lives, is that bullshit?
What do you think?
You bastard.
You can make any excuse for your drugs.
You've been lying to yourselves all your lives.
Your father and I have worked hard all our lives.
Who have we lied to?
Bullshit!
I worked hard all my life and it's bullshit?
I'm a liar?
Old Jia!
You're drunk. Don't go too far.
I need to be drunk today.
Tell me clearly, who did I lie to?
You lied to yourself.
Really?
I quit my fucking job as head of the local theatre.
I retired two years ahead of schedule to come here to serve you.
I lied to myself!
You came here on your own.
I didn't ask you to come.
He's right, I came on my own.
I deserve it!
I deserve it!
Do you think I look like Lennon?
A little bit.
Where is our family from?
What do you mean?
Are any of our ancestors from Europe?
No, your mother and I are from North-East China.
How about previous generations of our family?
Previous generations?
Previous generations?
My father is your grandpa... your grandpa's father is my grandpa...
There's no one from Europe.
Then why did Lennon tell me
I'm from England?
That's impossible.
We are from Jilin Jiutai.
Our ancestors' tombs are still there now.
Mom...
Mom!
What?
He's calling you.
Who's calling me?
The dragon.
What dragon?
Look at the cloud over there.
That's not a cloud, it's a dragon.
I was just talking to him.
He asked me to call you.
Stop lying. You must be dreaming!
It's true.
Get out!
Get out!
Shut up! Get out!
Hongsheng, who are you talking to?
Are you talking to us?
Hongsheng, what's the matter?
Don't move or I'll really come after you!
Hearing voices and seeing things... are common symptoms of schizophrenia.
These are also common side effects of heavy drug use.
It's hard to say if he's schizophrenic.
You need to monitor his symptoms.
His condition could make him violent and dangerous.
Watch him, he may have started using drugs again.
Why are you still awake?
I'm waiting for him.
Who knows when he will be back!
I'll wait until he comes back.
Why are you drinking?
You promised not to drink any more.
I don't drink every day.
Don't drink. You can't control yourself.
With him like this and your drinking.
What are we going to do?
Give it to me.
Stop drinking.
Leave me alone!
Hold on!
Where were you?
I went to Lijie's.
What were you doing?
Just hanging around.
Doing what?
You were doing drugs.
What's the matter with you?
Are you smoking again?
Why did you go in my room?
Why did you touch my things?
You quit for six months!
Don't waste all that effort!
It's not your business.
Don't move!
What do you want?
Where are you going?
Wherever I like.
You will die if you continue smoking!
It has nothing to do with you.
Of course it does.
I'm your father,
I have to take care of you!
Don't forget you've been a drunk all your life.
You're not qualified to take care of me, understand!?
Hongsheng, Hongsheng, Hongsheng!
Come back! Let him go!
Mom, come back inside.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Where are you going?
Back home.
What about him?
Forget him. We can't help him.
He'll die if we don't help him.
I've thought this through.
Let him smoke to death.
We still have a daughter.
We weren't meant to have two children.
Stop! You're just angry.
If we don't leave, he'll destroy us.
How can we leave him now?
If you don't want to go,
I'll leave by myself.
Old Jia, you are too selfish.
I don't want to die here.
That's enough. Stop quarrelling.
Leave right now if you want!
If you walk out that door, you and I are finished!
Whatever you say.
It's not the first time you've said that.
I mean it.
If you leave, don't come back.
Mom!
Mom!
Come out and have a drink with me.
We're sleeping.
It's my birthday today.
I've promised your mother
I wouldn't drink.
Have a drink for me.
Go ahead, don't drink too much.
Bottom's up.
There's too much...
Do it for me.
It's really too much.
Are you a man? Drink up!
Hongsheng, you've drunk too much.
Stop drinking, OK?
I'm happy today.
I don't want to get drunk and start trouble.
I'm here, I'll take care of you.
I'm 29 this year.
I've done nothing but smoke drugs for 4 years.
Do you know what I've been thinking all these 4 years?
I've been wondering why you are my father.
Are you my father?
I am your father.
You are not my father.
I'm Lennon's son.
That's your imagination.
It's not my imagination.
You are a peasant.
Why can't a peasant be your father?
Tell me why you are a peasant.
My father was a peasant.
Look at me.
Your generation has never understood life.
Why are you alive?
Is your life interesting?
Are you happy?
Hongsheng...
I don't understand what you're talking about.
I'm going to make you understand life!
What is happiness!
Hongsheng!
You are my father.
I have hit you.
I will kowtow to you.
Hongsheng, what are you doing?
Old Jia!
How dare you hit my father!
You bastard, I'll kill you!
Let go of me! I'll kill him, let me kill him!
After 6 months of interviews, we finally began rehearsals for the play.
What we'd worried about so long had finally happened.
If it happened once, it would happen again.
The situation had gotten violent and dangerous.
The day he told me
I wasn't his mother... something inside me just shattered.
The strength that had held me up for such a long time just disappeared.
We were tired of living in fear.
We can't take this any longer.
We have to send him into the hospital.
I felt everybody wanted to hurt me.
I felt death coming closer and closer.
A sound in my head told me...
"This is not the end."
I had no choice but to fight... fight with everyone.
Who is it?
Hongsheng, someone's looking for you.
Are you Jia Hongsheng?
Yes.
Come with us.
Why should I go with you?
I haven't broken any law.
The Resident's Association has called... because of your disturbing the neighbors.
This is not the first time.
Please put that down.
I won't go.
You don't have the right to arrest me.
Please calm down.
You'd better come with us now.
This is a domestic matter.
We hope you will co-operate with us.
Go with them.
We called the police.
Name?
Did you hear me?
What's your name?
Lennon.
Which character for "Le"?
The same "Le" as in Lenin.
Which character for "Non"?
"Non" as in the character for peasant.
Your age...
My birthday was a few days ago.
I didn't ask your birthday.
Tell me how old you are.
My birthday was a few days ago.
What's your address?
Where do you live?
London.
You live in London?
Take him to the ward now...
Put on this uniform.
We'll call you for dinner...
Someone new!
How about a hand-shake?
You're my new friend, we can talk tomorrow.
Let's shake hands.
Shake hands, shake hands with him.
Is that building next to my house done yet?
The Soviets called it hysteria and the Chinese call it dementia.
This is a good place for a rest.
Why don't you speak?
Did someone hurt you?
Get up! Time to get up!
Older Brother, give me an autograph.
I saw you in the movies
"Weekend Lover"... and "Silver Snake Murder".
Give me your autograph and I'll give you a cigarette.
Give me your autograph and I'll give you a cigarette.
Nurse, come here and light his cigarette!
Give me your autograph...
What are you doing?
The actor is giving me his autograph.
Are you an actor?
He was in "Weekend Lover" and "Silver Snake Murder".
I can act and sing.
I can act and sing, too.
What songs do you sing?
I can sing "Little Grass."
I'll do the first verse, you do the chorus.
OK.
I don't smell good like a flower.
I'm not as tall as a tree.
I'm a little grass and no one knows me.
But I never feel lonely,
I never feel worried.
I have all my friends around me.
Eat a lot of apples.
We bought salted fish... it won't go bad.
We'll bring more next week.
Get up!
Get dressed!
What's going on?
Go wash your faces.
Hurry up!
Get me out of here.
This is no place to live.
I'll really go crazy if I stay here any longer.
They will examine you on Monday.
It's up to the doctors.
If you are not sick, we'll get you out of here right away.
If you are sick, you'll have to stay here for a while...
Do I look sick?
We hope you aren't...
Why did you send me here?
You needed a change in environment.
"Change in environment?" Shut up!
You want to destroy me.
Why would we destroy our own son?
You have nothing to do with me!
- Hongsheng, what's the matter with you?
- Don't come to see me again!
Come on. Take your medicine.
Why do I take medicine?
If you are told to take it, just take it.
I'm not sick.
Why do you make me take this?
It's not up to you. The doctor decides.
I won't.
You have to!
Take it away!
I won't take this. Get out!
Can I have a cigarette?
Do you think I'm sick?
I don't think so.
You are seriously sick! Really sick!
You are not sick. You came to experience a new kind of life.
But when can I get out of here?
Don't think about it.
You'd have to adapt to your surroundings, they won't adapt to you.
Don't be afraid of illness.
Thinking about it... will make you more sick.
I've been living here for 50 years.
Take it easy,
I was like you when I came.
I can't spend my life here.
Nurse!
Nurse!
Nurse!
Nurse!
Nurse!
What are you yelling about?
Please untie me.
I'm uncomfortable.
Will you be nice?
Yes.
Will you take your medicine?
Yes, I will.
This can't happen again.
I know.
When the night is cloudy...
I saw a light, showing me a new day...
Take it naturally.
I dreamed about the dragon again.
He stayed on the ceiling.
Staring at me with his eyes.
He asked me, "Who are you?"
I said, "I am Jia Hongsheng".
He asked, "Who is Jia Hongsheng?"
I answered, "Jia Hongsheng graduated from The Central Academy of Drama.
He's an actor.
He loves rock music.
He loves Lennon and Plant.
He once wanted to be a famous actor and start his own band."
He said, " You are just a human being.
You like noodles, eggs... and nice clothes.
You like to sign autographs.
You cy and laugh.
You can even beg when you need help."
I asked him, "Why am I here?"
He said,
"This is the punishment for your sins.
You will be clean after all these sins have been paid for."
I asked him, "Am I clean now?"
He didn't answer me.
With his eyes still staring at me... he flew away.
He said, " You are just a human being.
You are just a human being.
You are just a human being.
You are just a human being.
A human being.
A human being.
A human being..."
Get up!
Time to get up!
What's your name?
Jia Hongsheng.
When did you come to the hospital?
June 19th.
For what reason?
I hit my father.
How old are you?
What's your birth year?
Sheep.
What's your birthday?
March 19th, 1967.
What's your address?
Rm.1003 Building 23...
Anyuan Beili, Asian Games Village.
You are an actor, are you?
Yes, I am.
Where were you trained?
The Central Academy of Drama.
When did you graduate?
What films have you been in?
"Summer Expectation"...
"Silver Snake Murder"...
"Good Morning, Beijing"...
What's your nationality?
Chinese.
I heard you have British bloodlines?
Not really.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Where's your hometown?
Jilin Siping.
Have you smoked drugs?
Yes.
When did you smoke the last time?
About a month ago.
Who is Lennon?
He's the vocal of a British band.
What relationship does he have to you?
None.
Didn't you say you are his son?
That's my imagination.
I just love his music very much.
Are you used to life here?
Yes, all the doctors and nurses are nice to me.
When did you take drugs for the first time?
When we rehearsed...
"Kiss of the
Spider Woman" in the fall of 1992.
How long were you addicted?
About 4 years.
What was the longest time you quit?
Half a year.
Can you quit for good?
I can.
Why?
Because I know I want to.
All right, you can go.
Wait, one more question.
You told your parents you saw a dragon?
Is that true?
It's true.
What did it look alike?
He looks exactly like me.
OK, you can go now.
Thanks.
First of all, we're sure he is not schizophrenic.
Unfortunately his nervous system... has been influenced by an excess of drugs and alcohol.
He needs treatment... to cure his hallucinations... and paranoia.
My suggestion is to keep him here for a while.
This will help to his recovery... and force him to stay away from drugs.
Hongsheng.
Hongsheng.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I just got here.
A doctor there said an actor was in the hospital.
I sneaked over after I knew it was you.
- What a coincidence!
- Sure is.
What are you here for?
Quitting drugs. How about you?
Me too. I also need to calm down.
Why aren't you over here in the drug section?
A lot of people bring drugs into that section.
It's hard to quit.
It' s easier in my section.
How long have you been here?
Three months.
How is it going?
Not bad. How are you doing?
Not so great.
Would you like an apple?
How long will you stay here?
I'd like to stay for a while... to quit drugs and alcohol.
Me too. I need to get clean.
Hongsheng, do you remember my girlfriend?
Yeah.
She's dead.
We were shooting up...
She jumped off a building.
Your Dad got a role a few weeks ago and made some money.
We've decorated the apartment.
The kitchen and bathroom are new.
We re-decorated your room.
I'm not sure if you like the style... if you don't, we'll change it.
We didn't touch your stuff.
It's all in boxes.
Your stereo didn't work.
Your father bought a new one for you.
What would you like for dinner?
Anything is OK.
Take a rest. I'll cook dinner.
Why did you begin using lard soap again?
It's not for you. I'll take it away.
Leave it here. I'm just asking.
We had brought them from home.
We started to use them after you went into the hospital.
Here, this is for you.
Hongsheng.
Yeah.
Want to listen some music?
OK.
What would you like?
Pink Floyd or Beatles?
Beatles.
OK.
Where is he?
I don't know. He was here a minute ago.
Please trust me today.
Let me be alone for one day.
I'm 30 today.
I feel a little bit strange.
Don't be so nervous.
He wants our trust, so we trust him this time.
I'm still worried.
We forgot his birthday!
Why didn't I remember?
It's been exactly one year.
Oh, you're home.
Yeah.
Sorry, we forgot it's your birthday today.
I'll go buy some beer.
I don't drink.
Have a little.
I quit.
Hongsheng, your sister got you a cake.
What else would you like?
I bought some noodles and minced pork.
How about some birthday noodles?
Great. I'll make them.
You scared me!
I thought there was a baby in here.
Want me to replay it?
OK.
Did you take your medicine?
Yes.
Don't stay up late.
What time are you leaving in the morning?
I'll call you at 7:00...
OK.
BREAD AND CHOCOLATE
Come on, throw it!
Independent, eh?
He doesn't need anybody to play a game. Not even an opponent.
I like that.
You speak Italian?
Why should you?
Nobody speaks it here.
Just me, because I don't know another language.
Kids are kids.
They always break your balls.
What were we saying?
Oh yes, that I like Switzerland.
And why, you'll ask?
Because it's clean.
The air, the grass...
The people mind their own business.
You say they're cold? No, they're
civilized ...that's different.
Know something?
Don't worry, madam, I'll get it.
Come on, I'll race you!
Come on!
Don't you want to come with me?
Your work permit?
I gave it to you with my passport.
I'm Giovanni Garofoli: innocent.
You're Italian.
Nobody's perfect, commissioner.
- Where do you work?
- I'm a waiter, commissioner.
I'm only temporary.
The restaurant is trying me out.
And before that?
I was a kitchen hand.
Oh, before that! I did everything.
Construction, carpentry...
I slept two years in the workers' bunkhouse.
It was absolutely wonderful there.
I mean, I had a bed there.
What else did I need?
We were too tired to even use any furniture.
- Why were you in the woods today?
- Just relaxing on my Sunday off.
Why did you run away?
I should have reported the crime.
But I didn't, partly out of tact.
After all, it's your crime.
I'm only a foreigner!
If you were me...well, being a
Commissioner, you'd call the police.
But you are the police, so why would you?
What are you talking about?
I don't know. Keep questioning me and you'll believe I'm the killer!
I'll confess, and the Turk will get the job!
What Turk?
The Turk? The restaurant only has one opening for a permanent waiter.
There are two of us trying out.
Me and a Turk.
It means everything to me.
It could change my life.
All right. You can go!
- Where to? - Go home.
Didn't you say you were innocent?
Yes, but...
- You believed me?
- Why, shouldn't I?
Yes, of course!
But...
I'm proud to work in this country...
...where you believe a man just because he's a man!
- You'll give back the ball?
- I won't worry, if you have it.
- Should I go?
- Yes, please.
Bring in the murderer.
- Did he sign a confession?
- Yes, voluntarily.
What's going on at table 8?
They've been waiting half an hour!
They ordered lamb.
Shall I go see what happened to it?
The table 6 will have to wait.
Send your busboy Gianni!
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Did you see Gianni?
Where's that son of a bitch?
Which one? There's so many here!
I'll kill him. That'll make one less!
Why the hell are you so late?
I was in the hospital.
They were insulting Italians.
I got mad and grabbed one of them...
And landed in the hospital!
I'm running up and down the stairs, doing your work...
...and you're playing the patriot!
I had three stitches!
Three stitches in three hours?
An hour a stitch?
If they throw me out because of you...
...if the Turk gets the job...
...they'll have to piece you back together with a sewing machine!
Watch out, please!
What is this, an avalanche?
Who else would it be but the Turk?
Looking for the kitchen?
The kitchen's over here,
We have fresh strawberries, today.
Your shirt...!
It's from the orange, signor Boegli.
I'll clean it right away.
Warn the gentlemen that the plates are scorching.
Serve them elegantly, please.
With style.
This is the second time
I've found a fish hidden here.
They'll think we're all thieves.
I'll take it upstairs.
Careful, Miguel, careful.
Nothing. Careful, eh?
Here it is. It has just arrived.
Why do the foreigners dislike us Italians so much?
Go see how they treat southern Italians in Milan!
I'd have gotten a life sentence there.
There are too many of us here.
2 million foreigners in a country of 5 million! An invasion!
But how would they manage without us Italians to work?
They'd get Spaniards, or Greeks, or Slavs,
They're not as pretentious and they don't waste time in the hospital!
Look at the Turk. He'd work even if they cut his hands off!
Look who's coming!
At your best, eh?
Of course, monsieur, don't you worry!
Who the hell is he?
It's a pleasure to have you back, sir.
Thanks. I'll be staying for a while.
To what do we owe the honour?
Vacation? Business?
Taxes, my friend, taxes!
The minute I step foot in
Italy, it'll cost me 3 million!
Idiot! You sit down without a seat?
This is no picnic on the grass.
It's a restaurant.
You're new here.
Giovanni Garofoli... they're trying me out.
Not bad for a try!
Anything wrong?
Everything's fine.
We're in good hands.
He's special, this guy.
Don't lose him.
We Italians have to help each other.
We're both exiles, Garofoli.
Exactly alike, sir!
There's a chair this time, don't worry.
- What are you doing there?
- Me? Nothing.
Come on, I'll buy you a coffee.
You mad at me?
If I was a little rough on you, don't be hurt.
- I could be your father. How old is he?
- Thirty-six.
I could be your grandfather.
You're young and inexperienced.
So you get into fights.
So what if somebody doesn't like Italians?
We often can't stand each other, so imagine how foreigners feel!
Feel lonely? Need company?
I'm right here.
We can work together days, and look for girls at night.
What are you up to?
She's with you?
Signor Nino, I'll tell her
I'm going with you instead.
If you've got a girl, why have coffee with me? imbecile!
On you go!
Watch him, signorina. Don't make him defend Italy's good name.
Or he'll be in the hospital every day!
Some patriot! He talks politics, meanwhile he's screwing around!
Maria, you better get up here in a hurry.
I may not be so young anymore,
But every six months at least, a man needs his wife!
It's different for a woman.
A woman is calmer.
More sentimental. She doesn't feel certain needs so strongly.
Or does she?
There she goes again...
What were you saying?
What were you saying... about the lights?
When I turn off the light at night, I feel alone, too.
This dame plays the piano and never turns off the lights.
Breaks your balls, but it's good music.
You'll really bring us to Switzerland?
He's been there 3 years now! ls he building his own train?
You think I'm telling lies?
A man who's away that long forgets his family.
- Not my Nino!
- Just you wait a couple of years!
Anyway, don't you think
I worry about it, too?
But it's you I'm here working for!
It's you I'm sweating for!
Look, I'll show you that I love you!
I'll show you and your brother!
Look!
See this?
And that's just one day's tips.
In Italy, I wouldn't see this much in 40 years.
They think I'm enjoying myself this far away!
I want my daughter to marry here and my son to grow up here!
Wait till I get that job over the Turk.
I'll bring you all here to drown in Swiss money!
A man could find something in Italy, too.
A bomb! Like the one you found poaching, that blew off your hands!
What are you laughing about?
Do you still remember your daddy?
Do you still remember daddy?
Run, run fast, or burn your ass!
Don't say "ass", Giacomo.
Ass! Ass! Up your ass!
When did he ever listen to anybody?
- You stay up pretty late, eh?
- Sometimes.
Your lights were on all last night.
The meters keep running.
- I'm afraid of the dark.
- With this peace and quiet?
It's like a cemetery.
That's just it!
I don't really understand you.
You're always so alone, so mysterious.
What are you anyway?
Turk? Yugoslav?
- Anarchic? Pianist?
- Greek.
- And you speak Italian?
- I used to teach it.
You were a professor?
And now, you're a factory worker?
In Greece, many more important people than I had to leave.
Right. Down there, you are even worse off than us.
If you ever want company, to talk, play the piano...whatever...
...just give me a call, and I'll be there.
Thanks, but I don't think that'll be necessary.
Goodnight. And down with the colonels!
Excuse me?
Down with the colonels. No good?
It's perfect!
- Goodnight, and down with them!
- Who's going to listen to you here?
Signor Nino, this is it.
They chose you.
Let's hope so.
Well, Garofoli, how are you?
Still innocent, commissioner.
What did you do Sunday?
I mean, after our talk.
You committed obscene acts in public.
Can I talk to you man-to-man?
It's been months since I thought about obscene acts, even in private!
Didn't you pee?
Well, every once in a while.
Why, is it forbidden?
In public, yes.
What pig would do it in public?
See if you recognize him.
Just a couple drops, commissioner.
I didn't even realize. It was the interrogation...the upset...
Before a woman!
With all the beauties of Switzerland, they have to photograph this?
All right, I'll pay a fine!
I'll cut it off!
You wouldn't kick me out because of this?
Not if signor Boegli renews your permit,
Without a work permit,
I can't stay in Switzerland.
How can I go back to Italy?
After three years of promises, what do I tell my family? That I peed?
Signor Boegli, you're not influenced by this nonsense, are you?
We're all like a big family here.
Tell the commissioner.
He'll tell you now.
No room, eh?
Not until Florence.
And after that, who gives a damn?
Play, paisan, play!
Tomorrow we'll be home!
I'll never look at a watch again, to forget this country.
They're all ice here. No heart!
And they've got no sea.
They can't even wash.
You don't have any sea!
Look at the sea, and you look at beauty.
What feeling it inspires!
What are you doing here?
You didn't leave?
I can't.
I can't go back to Italy like this.
I'd shoot myself first.
I just need to stay two or three days.
I'll sleep on the floor, anywhere.
I already know where to get work.
Listen, I'd like to help you, but I can't.
I don't live alone.
- Can't you explain to the gentleman...?
- No, impossible.
Why did you choose me?
The restaurant took away my room and my work papers.
- I trust you. You're a political exile.
- That's just it!
You don't have bombs here, do you?
It's an immigration policeman.
Don't hide. We'll find an excuse.
I'd throw bombs for you, but not now!
Don't worry, he's a friend.
A friend of who?
No, they've gone.
You understand now, right?
He's your son...and he doesn't have a permit to stay in Switzerland.
Not yet. If they find him, they'll make us both leave.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's like that all over.
Immigrants' closets have more kids than moths!
- Where'd you put the Swiss guy?
- I said I had to get a scan'.
Get it, then.
We'll talk when I get back.
My son is Grigory.
I'm Nino.
I'm Elena.
It's a pleasure.
The pleasure is mine.
That's why the lights are always on.
You live at night, like bats.
What should we do?
Play a game of cards?
Great idea! But let's hurry, before they make us go back in the closet.
I warn you, I'm good.
You choose the game.
Solitaire? Sorry I ever said a word!
I make great airplanes, if you have some scissors and paper.
How old are you?
How old are you?
You don't speak a word of Italian?
Well, say so!
Then I wouldn't go on like an idiot!
You're cute, though.
If only you could talk...
You're insulted?
He can't understand, but he gets insulted!
Are you crazy?
You'll get sick, you'll get drunk.
I was talking to keep you company.
I don't need you for conversation... for all you have to say!
I'll sit down in a corner.
I'll open a nice book.
I'll close it because it's in Greek.
And I'll stay here nice and quiet.
Know the song of the little bird?
I'll teach it to you.
Music, you can understand.
You'll learn right away.
One finger only.
It's pretty! The priest taught it to me when I was your age.
See how easy?
Go on, now you try.
Mama will have a nice surprise.
That's a nice tune, too!
Good morning, sir...here's our wake-up song for you!
That's enough, see you tomorrow.
Ever have musicians wake you up?
Well, I had a radio once...
No, you need live music to wake up to.
Well, pisser!
Didn't the Swiss throw you out?
But so many Italians do well here.
They open businesses...
You complain about this country, eh?
Until it's time to leave.
Blame Italy, that forces us to emigrate.
Sure, if you stay here, you have to make some little -
...sacrifice.
Meet a dear old friend.
What's your name?
- She's your wife?
- She's a whore!
Sorry, I didn't notice.
I need work, so I won't have to go back to Italy.
I'll find you all the jobs you want.
But what will you get out of it?
- Money?
- If at all possible...
You make money with money, not with work.
But if you don't have any...
How much do you have on you?
Show me.
Sorry, but I hide my money on me... for security.
After all, you never know.
So I made a little inside pocket.
My zipper got caught in my underwear.
It's stuck there.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I tore my shirt, too!
Here it is.
Guess right and double your money.
Guess wrong and you lose everything.
What do I drink in the morning?
Tea or coffee?
You better give me back my money.
I knew it, no guts!
Go back to work, then.
Coffee?
Pay him double.
Hurry up, I have to pick up my wife and kids.
You, disappear!
Leave before I get back.
- What? Putting it back in your ass?
- It's the safest place I have.
I'll have to make you all over!
After the airport,
I'll invest your money in a bank.
Your family?
How much does a plane like that cost?
It costs, it costs. Don't buy one.
Having a father like you is some advantage.
When you're born rich, you can only lose your own money.
A poor man has drive...
...a hunger for life.
You're lucky you don't have a lira.
Some luck. And just think how many of us there are!
Hey. champion!
- And where's mum? Didn't she come?
- She couldn't.
I don't know why.
I'll get their suitcases.
Handsome kids.
They look just like foreigners!
Have a nice vacation?
Want to go right home, or take a drive first?
Whatever you want, dad.
Dad, can we go right to school with Jim? Do you mind?
I don't give a good goddamn!
Maybe your wife was held up by something important.
You know, at the last minute...
Do I know her?
Was your wife ever at the Beau Rivage restaurant with you?
Oh, she's gorgeous!
Mine is too... in her own modest way, of course.
She's a shit!
Maybe that photo isn't too good...
Why did she turn against me?
Why turn my kids against me?
Oh, you mean, yours...
To her, I'm an idiot who squandered the family fortune.
My fortune, not hers!
Who put 10,000 men out of work...
As if she gave a damn about workers...!
That's my wife, sir!
Sorry, I'll have it pasted back together.
I'll do it, I just have to find all the pieces... here's a leg...
....here's an arm... here's grandma....
Want to work for me?
I need a new butler.
Someone I can trust.
You can start whenever you like.
Even tonight.
Here's Giacomo's head...
So many pieces! Like mincemeat!
You both must be crazy.
Look at the table.
Grigory decorated it.
And your millionaire“?
My money must already be in his bank.
I phoned that I'd start tomorrow.
He was sorry. He's lonely.
He'll appreciate me all the more.
Not more than we do!
Right, Grigory?
Give him to me,
I'll carry him to bed.
He's intelligent. I taught him all the bad words my son says...
He caught on right away.
So long, Mozart.
Nino's leaving you tomorrow.
Don't you have anything to say?
Up your ass...
See how fast he learns?
You go to sleep now, too.
Tomorrow's a big day for you.
You have to be in good shape.
I'm not very good with words, but...
No, it's all wrong.
You, me, the situation...
We'll say goodbye tomorrow.
I know, you're lonely, just like I am.
That's not a good enough reason.
I make you laugh, eh?
Elena, you can't give up now.
Can I come in?
May l...?
Isn't anybody home?
Butler...?
Secretary...?
They're ringing!
May l...?
Did you sleep well?
Breakfast is served.
Milk, coffee, butter, marmalade, and Nino Garofoli!
Should I open the curtains?
You don't feel well?
Don't worry, sir, I'm here!
You drank too much, eh?
What can I give him? ls there any medicine here?
No, these are just sleeping pills.
More sleeping pills...
"Nightie Naps"...
"Sleep-tite"...all empty.
My God! Sir, you didn't take all this stuff?
Butler...! Damn him!
Did he go for a doctor?
I could call and ask the restaurant for one.
The Beau Riveau Restaurant...
Bart...Barz...
Bank. ..bank. ..bank. . .there's nothing but banks in this country!
My money!
Sir, now I feel sick.
Sir, where did you deposit my money?
This may be a bad time, but while you're still here, make an effort.
You're not all that clear!
What will I tell my family? That I lent my money to a millionaire?
Will they laugh at me!
You close down factories, put 10,000 men out of work...
You get off, and I pay?
The criminal! Jail is too good for him.
They should give you the life sentence.
Even when he's dying, he's screwing someone!
Drink, and vomit.
It'll do you good.
Got a chill, sir?
Where did he go?
Oh, it's the bed. how do you stop it?
Some time for a massage!
Oh, there's nothing left.
Well, you can't die yet.
I'll bring you back to life if I have to kick your ass in.
This isn't elegant or scientific...
...but you'll wake up when I throw this in your face!
Good morning to you.
Here's your wake-up song.
And here's a cheerful toast with milk and coffee!
So you're still alive, you old bastard!
Your horse's ass!
Where've you been?
I'm glad to see your foolish fat face.
You old whore's behind!
Enough compliments!
I have to talk to you.
- What happened to your leg?
- Scaffolding...
They always give us the dangerous jobs.
I need to stay here a night or two, till I work things out.
I know it's dangerous, and that there's a guard. But if you -
But if you let me touch you,
I'll never leave your side.
Then I'll come a little closer and jump right inside!
Go on Gigi, sing, sing.
What got into you? After all we've been through together?
You at the head, and me at the foot!
You'll sleep here in my bed!
- Suppose they catch us?
- They'll think we're fags!
With that mug of yours?
Wasn't I a beautiful doll?
You have kept them?
I still have our costumes.
They're not rags, they're trophies!
Renzo, this is the guy I sang
The Three Graces with.
He's 18 and has a wife and two kids. The idiot!
- Come on, you know the song.
- Not now, Gigi, I'm bushed.
How did it go? You remember?
Who says these bunnhouses are lousy?
So what if they're freezing? It keeps the bedbugs from eating us alive!
We didn't come here out of need.
We've got enough need at home!
If a guy lets his head fall in his plate, it's not because he's tired.
It's because he's too dumb to know a plate from a pillow!
Everyone envies us. Even the Swiss.
They come to see how we're getting along. And how are we getting along?
We feel wonderful! Who cares if our wives are far away?
The administration sends us the loveliest, sexiest girls in the world.
Gentlemen, here's Gigia!
And here's the one and only Rosina!
Rosa, why don't you write to me?
If you'll just listen, we'll sing you a song.
Every day, sun or rain,
I cross the border by train.
I'm Gigia, the commuter's broad.
If you want me, I'm easy to board!
Whoever wants her can jump aboard.
Nice behind, in front even cuter, she's the emigrants' favorite commuter!
For just a couple francs as pay, we go up and down every day!
Ah, life is hard...forward and back!
But harder in the back!
Traveling, you'll find broadens your mind.
I'm Rosina and I know how to make do.
I can cook, make beds, sew...and screw!
A wonderful cook, but better to screw!
Man isn't made of wood,
dear little wife of mine.
So if I'm unfaithful to you...
What the hell can you do?
Just blame the hard luck that took me far from home.
To tell of our virtues, here's Mama!
I've imported each little creature.
Touch them and you pay duty,
They're home-grown, not exotic.
Here's your chance to be patriotic.
Swiss girls are hard to get.
No foreigner's made them yet.
Leave them alone! Don't you touch!
You've broken your ass for them, that's enough!
You'll be much better off with this native stuff!
Man isn't made of wood. ..
Dear little wife of mine...
Renzo, what's wrong?
- Nothing. I just want to go home.
- Well, you'll go home.
Like them? Humiliated here for years, and laughing about it?
We're just keeping our spirits up.
I'm sick of these dumb jokes.
Let him be. He's hysterical.
No, he's right! They've screwed us all our lives with a song and a guitar.
And we're still singing!
We've been had.
We have to change things, not sing about them.
I could vomit every time
I hear "sun" and "sea"!
These whores won't let me sleep!
Go on, sleep.
But it's time to wake up!
Look at yourself in the mirror, bitch!
- You call me that?
- Who else?
Can a paisan offer you a ray of light?
A job, with no documents required?
Only 10% the first three months...
Trust a paisan...healthy, outdoor work, and no documents needed!
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
I won't tell you.
Me neither.
And so we're through.
Our paisan sent me.
It's the guy with no papers!
Don't worry, none of us have papers.
We're all one, big family.
You raise chickens?
No, we get them full grown.
We only kill them, bless the Madonna.
Look how beautiful!
Come, I'll show you how it all works.
Every job is done with love!
Here, you put in the head and chop it off. Watch your hand...
This is the steam machine. Beautiful!
And here, the feathers come off.
It's like a party!
At night, you go to sleep with a clear conscience...
...thanking God, and blessing the Madonna.
Even without any feathers, these creatures seem almost human.
- Let's go eat. Aren't you hungry?
- What do you earn a day?
They're always playing.
It's a piece work. The more you kill, the more you earn.
We get up when the cock crows...
You kill him...
...and, thank God, we start another day...
...blessing the Madonna!
Our house is right there.
But that's a chicken coop.
There are no chickens there now.
It's still a chicken coop.
It's not a chicken coop if there aren't any chickens!
The owner offered us a house, but we'd have to pay rent.
This one is completely free.
Look how nice it is, thank God.
That's Mimmo.
My married nephew sleeps here.
Salvatore and his wife, here... each one has his own little apartment.
And Mimmo sleeps alone.
How do you do without women?
I manage.
And where do I sleep?
There in that mess, or with Mimmo.
In that mess.
Why not make a hole in the roof so you could stand up sometimes?
Look at the table and chairs.
Sawed in half!
You're new here, son.
Little by little, you'll get used to it.
And never stand up again.
That's the Madonna of Pompei.
If I bowed down lower, it'd seem like adulation!
Well, do you like our house?
Maybe if you really searched, you'd find a place like this in Italy.
Maybe.
But we couldn't make as good money.
Oh, we don't spend any of it.
We have all we need.
It's all put aside for a rainy day.
Here are our women...
Daughter, mother, and niece.
You didn't saw them in half.
No, they fit just right!
Don't grow anymore or they'll throw you out.
He's already 12 years old.
A big bruiser! Do you go to school?
To a German school?
No, he can't understand.
If he did, he'd kill himself.
He only knows the language of the chickens.
Hear how well he does it?
Do it again for Nino!
No, once is enough!
Look at Michele!
Do it like Michele!
Isn't he just like a real chicken?
I hesitated to say it...
Make a toast, Nino!
I'd like to ask one question.
All right, but on your feet!
Are you insulted?
At this point...
That's enough! Let him go on.
Just one question...
Who am I?
He doesn't know who he is?
He said Nino Garofoli,
Maybe he forgot!
You're Italian and I'm Italian.
But is that enough to make us alike? Am I like you?
If I went out with Mimmo...
...who's content to live in a place like this...
...what would people say?
That we're alike?
My son, why worry about what people say?
People are envious!
Well then, I ask you, how do you see me?
Michele, how do you see me?
Tell me!
The same as us...exactly the same.
Nino, come see!
Where are we going?
To see what?
They're the owners' children, with their friends.
Beautiful, eh?
Beautiful!
Sir, the public baths close at 6!
Dark or light?
This guy doesn't know what the hell he wants!
I'm Italian! So what?
You don't like it?
The Italians will win this game 7 to 0!
Go on, threaten me!
That's what I'm here for!
I'll say whatever I like!
I understand what I'm saying!
Move forward, signora.
These young kids, they see fine from this distance.
Even without glasses...
I can't go to the hospital!
Are you all right, amigo?
Did they hurt you?
What language is that?
Aren't you German?
Spanish, senior!
Would you believe it...?
You're to be across the frontier by midnight.
With pleasure. All my best!
Sorry, but it just came over me.
I'm Italian!
Sorry, signora. It was my hand!
It's not allowed here!
Well, I'll pee later, out the window!
So long, sergeant.
Thanks for everything!
Write me sometime, handsome!
Is there a small place for a guy who can't find a place anywhere?
Do they want me?
What's your name?
Then it's probable!
What would they want?
Maybe it's good news.
In German? Impossible!
Right. Remember, you haven't seen me.
Who even knows you?
Who is he, anyway?
Are you all right, Nino?
Didn't you hear the loudspeaker?
Yes, but I didn't understand very well.
You look so funny.
I cut myself.
Half blond and half brunette...
That's me. Neither here nor there.
It's hard to explain all that's happened.
I know. Rudiger told me.
Remember my friend?
When you hid in the closet?
Oh, the Swiss cop.
You still see him?
I married him.
Then you still see him.
He's a good man.
If the Pope picks them as his guards, they must have some qualities.
He gave me this for you.
It's a residency permit.
You can stay another six months, and find any work you like.
Nino, aren't you pleased?
There's no end to it!
They just kicked me out!
It was all over!
You try everything, you fight...
...but when you lose - at least you get a rest!
So, you'd rather go back to Italy?
You just want to go away?
Then what do you want?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because my head hurts...
Listen to me, Nino. The problem isn't Italy or
Switzerland. Choose any country.
Choose whatever you like.
But choose to live!
Don't give up now.
Don't ever give up!
Tell that to Grigory.
What has he got to do with it?
He still remembers me?
He often talks about you.
Well, tell it to him.
But he's only a child.
That's just it. He can use it.
I'm tired, Elena. I don't have the heart for it.
The train is leaving..
You're very kind, Elena.
Thanks for thinking of me,
Come on, you don't need to die too..
What should I tell Rudigge?
He wanted so much to help you!
I don't know what to say, I don't even know him!
He likes the flowers?
Oh, no, flowers for a policeman...
Damn it, if you arrived a little later
 it shouldn't have been this problem!
Why did he mixed up?
Tell him you didn't find me!
Tell him what do you want, for me it's the same!
Say hello to Grigori!
- Nino!
- Yes?
All we need is the sun!
All we need is the sea!
The girl of my heart and a song to sing!
Whether you gained...
Whether you lost...
Let's forget the past...
We're from Naples, paisan!
Ya! That's me. Abhay Sharma.
The most important part of this college, and as you can see, everyone here knows just how important l am.
Actually, l'm the life of this college.
Because without me, these people won't even make it through one day,
'cause l make it all happen.. yeah!
Hey, Abhay!
Your homework.
Oh! Thanks man! You really make it all happen..
What would l do without you? lt's OK, Bill.
Ya! So, that was my introduction.
Abhay Sharma.
Ya, ya, l know what you all must be thinking about me.. that l don't look so cool.
But these things don't matter.
Why? Because the most beautiful girl in college is my girlfriend, Alisha.
OK! OK! Fine. The last part was a bit of a lie.
Actually, she doesn't even know who l am.. if l even exist or not.. you know..
Bill, l will give you that history homework tomorrow, OK?
Ya! So this was me. Abhay Sharma. And that was Alisha, the love of my life.
She doesn't know this yet, but someday she will.
Everything will be just fine.
Don't you worry! What?
You don't believe me?
Would l ever lie to you guys?
OK, OK, OK.. l know l just lied but you know what they say, right.. that everything's fair in love and war, and however impossible it may seem.. this is definitely love.
Aah, boy.
Hey, boy! You, the hunk with the trunk.
Packin' in a fully loaded funky junk.
Hey, boy! With the brandy snap eyes.
He tell me sinful beautiful lies l've been looking for a boy
Who can change my day to night l've been looking for a boy
Who only talks about me
Some boy like this
Some boy like that
No one boy will have it all 'cause..
Oh baby, the truth is l'm way out of your league
Alisha
From the moment l saw you
My heart did not listen
But the truth is
You're way out of my league
Alisha
From the moment l saw you

Hey boy! Me an easy girl to please
Just wanna Mr. right from you honneyz ln my dreams l can see my guy

From the moment l saw you
My heart did not listen
But the truth is

Hey boy! Get me drippin' with ice
Get down on your knees and say what's nice
Hey boy! Get me drippin' with ice
Get down on your knees and say what's nice l had read about him sometime
That he'll be waiting for me somewhere
He'll be my beloved just like l'll be his
And his heaven will be at my feet
Some boy like this
Some boy like that
No one boy will have it all 'cause..
Oh baby, the truth is l'm way out of your league
Alisha
From the moment l saw you
My heart did not listen

Alisha
From the moment l saw you

Alisha..
And as it often happens in love, a time comes when the boy and girl meet for the very first time.
Tonight was that night. l was so good at it.
Oh, get off me, Natasha.
They say boys will never understand what goes through a girl's mind..
Stop it! Don't be such a party pooper! l guess this was something like that.
You know you want me to do it!
No! No!
- OK, you know you want me to do it!
Stop! Stop being a mummy!
Alisha! Stop this!
Oh God! lt sucks!
Uh oh.. lt's very late.
Let's go Alisha, c'mon.
OK, OK.. do not panic,
OK.. l can do this.
Alisha! Oh my God.. Alisha come down..
Alisha, you're making me nervous, just come down!
Babe.. it's just freaking tequila we've done this a hundred times before!
Alisha! Come down!
OK, OK, watch, OK watch.. l can do this on my toes!
- Alisha.. l can do this on my toes!
Alisha come down! Alisha!
Alisha!
Oh my God! Alisha!
Alisha! Alisha!
Alisha!
She cannot swim..
Alisha!
Help, someone help!
Looks like l'll have to give her mouth to mouth.. ls she OK?
Thank you so much! But we'll take it from here, OK?.. thank you.
Hey, what went wrong?
This was not how it was supposed to be, by now she should've fallen in love with me. l mean, l saved her life, right? l can't understand it.
Ya! l know when!
Tomorrow morning.. of course.. l'm so stupid, right! ln matters of the heart l'm sort of new.
Enough is enough l'm fed up Alisha! l don't care what stage your semester is in. l'm taking you away from here and that's final.
Dad! My entire life is here.
How can you even suggest that? l don't care! This is the fifth time l've been called here. l can't take it any more. l am not going anywhere! l'm not asking you. l'm telling you, understand?
So what will you do? Take me from here forcefully? l wanna see you try!
- l'm taking you away right now! l've spoken to the Dean and as of today you've been rusticated..
.. from this university, understand?
That is so unfair.
Pack your bags.
Dad, please.. my semester! l'm waiting outside.
- Dad, please!
Look, thanks for whatever you did last night.
But l think you should go now. She needs to be alone. Thanks anyway.
Don't worry. l'll speak to your dad.
Everything's gonna be alright.
He's not gonna listen. What makes you think he's gonna listen to you.. he's just stubborn.. who were you speaking to?
Nobody.. just that geek who saved your life last night. l should say thank you, right?
Ya.. but that's not important right now. l guess..
The truth is that not every love story can have a happy ending, right?
And when something like this happens then people like..
.. us need to forget about our love and move on.
She still doesn't even know who l am.. and it's OK.
Now, l just need to get her out of my heart.. that's all.
Alisha, l guess this love was impossible after all.
But l wish you happiness wherever you go. Goodbye, Alisha.
Good morning, Abhay Sharma!
This is your wake up call for the day. l have the following facts for you this morning.
Did you know that the white part of your fingernail is called the lunula?
Did you know that when a coffee seed is planted it takes five years to yield consumable fruit?
Did you know that the largest prime number is 1 3, 395 digits long more than the number of..
Morning.
Morning, Dad.
Dad, l have a very important meeting today.
Meeting? What meeting?
There's an investor who is interested in my software. l'm giving him a presentation today.
That's great! But you should have come to me first. l have lots of friends in the software industry. l could have set up a meeting with any one of them for you.
Dad, you started your business alone.
You did everything solely on your own. l want to follow in your footsteps.
Like father, like son.
But if you ever need anything you know that l'm here, right?
Of course, Dad. Now eat your cereal. l'm worried about you, friend! No, l'm really worried!
You've been in love with that girl for six years..
What was her name?
- Alisha.
Alisha. lt's been six years!
Not six, Dad, it's been seven years.
Of course! Seven years. Look son..
There's love and then there's obsession.
You need to forget about this girl.
Anyway, l have to go. And good luck for your interview!
Abhay?
- Ya. Hi!
Hi! Siddharth Singh.
You can call me Sidhu.
OK.
Some coffee? Ya?
- Ya.
Excuse me, two cappuccinos please!
So, finally we meet.
- Ya. l've heard a lot about your software. l.. l hope you like it. l'm sure l will. So shall we begin?
OK, let's start. So this software is essentially an operating system that l've named Unity.
Now, you'll be thinking, why Unity?
Well, Unity because this operating system has the ability to unify each..
.. and every kind of operating system across the world. l mean, you can use programs running on any operating system on Unity. lt could be Windows, the
Mac OS or even Linux systems.
Moreover, you can even use it on your mobile phone.
So, from mobile phones to computers, it works on everything.
So this is Unity, my work over the last seven years.
Fantastic! Abhay, l'm impressed.
Thanks. l'm very impressed. ln fact, this has exceeded my expectations.
Just one thing Abhay.
- Ya?
Before investing in this, l'll need the original program files of this software.
Program files? OK..
Yes, l'll need them.
Can you just excuse me, please?
Hello, Dad?
Hi, Abhay, how are you?
How are things?
Dad, he's quite impressed but he's asking for the original program files.
He's saying that he wants them before he invests in the software.
No, no, no. Don't give him anything until the deal is finalised.
Tell him that after the deal is done you will give the files to him, OK?
Nothing before that.
Don't make that mistake. OK?
OK, OK, Dad. Thanks. Bye.
Should we go ahead?
Uh, actually Sidhu, sir.. l won't be able to give you the actual program files until the deal is done.
But l have a CD that contains the executable files.
You can learn everything about the software through it. This you can take.
Look, Abhay. Don't get me wrong.
Your Unity software is fantastic.
But on giving it some thought l feel that this is not what we're looking for right now.
But.. but l assure you, sir!
This is a path breaking software.
No, it's fantastic but just not right for us right now.
But all the best and thank you very much.
Sir, it's taken me seven years to develop this software..
.. and l've personally tested it in every possible hardware configuration.
So if you're thinking compatibility, it's compatible with all the hardware systems. lf you're thinking speed, l've tested it in all the benchmark tests..
.. and if you're thinking usability then this is so easy that even a child can use it.
So, as you can see, this is going to be a revolutionary new software called Unity.
What's the name of the company?
- Pinnacle. very good presentation, Mr.
Sharma. very good.
But we've heard that there is a Singapore-based company..
.. that is going to launch a similar software, and it's called.. Unify?
Unify? But, but sir, l developed this software, it's absolutely original. lt's not possible that someone could develop.. a software exactly like this one, it's just not possible, sir. l hear what you're saying, Mr. Sharma.
But our company wouldn't want to get involved in anything that harms our reputation. l hope you understand.
Anyway, thank you very much, Mr.
Sharma, l wish you all the best.
Excuse me, could you tell me the name of that Singapore company.. ?
Ya, sure.. Pinnacle Software.
.. Pinnacle Software.
Can you just excuse me please?
- Sure.
So, what you're saying is that you have made this software.
Dad, l've been working on this for the last seven years.
OK, and now someone has stolen it from you?
Ya.
You know, Abhay, l'm to blame for making you like this.
Like what?
Like me. Running away from unpleasantness, not fighting for your rights, but there's a reason behind this.
After your mother passed away l just wanted to protect you from the rest of the world, and in the process l made you weak.
That's not true.
That's true. Now if you want to forget about this software..
.. and stay here with me, l'll still love you as much as l do right now. l'll still be proud of you.
But if you go to Singapore and get your software back from that man then you will be proud of yourself. lt's your decision, what do you want to do?
You know,.. ,l have the best dad in the world. l know that.
And l'm going to Singapore.
Taxi! l'm sorry sir, but there's no one with the name Siddharth Singh..
.. working in any department of this company.
Dad, l'm sitting outside the Pinnacle office.
There's no one named
Siddharth Singh here. l'm at a loss, Dad. What should l do?
Son, don't lose hope and remember one thing - that you have..
.. to get your software back no matter what, OK?
Believe in yourself, everything will be alright.
And what if l don't find him? l don't think he's here at all. l don't know what to do. lf this company releases my software then what can l do about it, Dad?
Please help me, l don't know what to do, l just.. just don't know what to do any more.
Relax, relax Abhay.. just relax.
OK, do one thing. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.
Now imagine good things around you. lmagine that there are new, beautiful computers around you.
And Alisha..
Of course, of course, Alisha.. her too, ya?
Feeling good, right son?
Ya, Dad.
Now open your eyes.
Feeling good? l feel great, Dad, just great. l can see her, like.. like she's right in front of me.
She's just so beautiful.
Who?
Alisha, Dad! Who else?
Son, l told you to open your eyes!
Dad, my eyes are open but she's still in front of me!
OK, fine, no problem.
Actually, this is even better,
You keep dreaming about her! So what is Alisha doing right now?
Dad, she's gone inside the Pinnacle office.
That's a good thing! lt's a good sign.
So, why don't you follow her into the office
And fight for what's rightfully yours?
Get your software back, it's not me but Alisha who is showing you the path.
You're right Dad, l'm going.
OK, good. l'm going too, to the bathroom!
Look, l'm not going to take no for an answer. l need to see someone right now.
But - No ifs or buts! l want to see someone, now!
OK, OK, sir, just calm down.
Let me see what l can do.
Hi! There's someone who wants to meet the head of PR urgently. ls that alright? OK, thank you.
Sir, you can go to the fourth floor..
..and meet our public relations officer in charge. lt's the first room on the left.
OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Sorry. lt's alright.
C'mon now. You guys can't even do this much? l have to do everything myself?
Oh, my God!
Even l was remembering God, Dad!
Look, you've been in love with this girl for the last six years..
Seven years, Dad.
OK, don't correct me.
Seven years? OK, fine.
Don't you think you should speak to her now at least?
What's the worst that could happen?
She won't recognise you, or she might give you a slap or two!
But at least you'll have a clear picture about your situation.
You're absolutely right, Dad.
Basically, you're not going to speak to this girl..
No, Dad.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
Taxi! Taxi!
Thank you.
Tania, stop troubling me! Tania, l can't deal with this, are you mad?
Tania! Tania! Stop it,
Tania, have you lost your mind?
Tania, behave yourself, l'm not going to deal with your nonsense, Tania, l swear!
Just stop it, Tania!
You're driving me mad..
..Tania, l can't deal with your nonsense any more!
Thank God! You're here.
Look, l can't do this any more, she's not a child, she's a monster!
Forgive me, but l'm leaving. l quit!
No, no, no, no Mansi, you can't go anywhere.
Look, please, l need to get back to office and there's no one here to look after Tania.
Please, please. OK, just try and understand, l'm a single, divorced working mother and l don't have anyone else! - l don't care!
OK, OK, fine, l'll pay you double, double! l don't care!
- Triple! But not more than that. l'm sorry Alisha, but l love my own life more than money.
Now you handle this monster of yours, l'm out of here.. bye!
Mons.. ! Tania Merchant!
Mom! You're home, yay!
Oh no you don't, don't try cute on me. lt's not gonna work. l'm very upset with you.
How will l go back to the office now?
So don't go to the office, Mom.
We'll spend the entire day together.
Why do you trouble me so much, T?
Cause l love you, Mom! l love you too, munchkin, but you know Mom is working.
And however much l want to, l can't spend the entire day with you.
Now, we'll have to find somebody to look after you. Who?
Hello.. Jasmeet and
Jasmeet Nanny Agency.. an exclusive agency of lndian Nannies.
Our Nannies are extremely intelligent..
Jasmeet! This is Alisha..
Alisha Merchant.
Alisha! Alisha! You talk to her.
Not me! Not me! l won't speak to her.
- Again..
Oh no!.. speaker.
Ya, hello Alisha dear.
So, tell me, how can l be of assistance to you?
Jasmeet, you know what?
That nanny you sent me had so much attitude! l've fired her, and now my problem is that l need to get back to the office.
And l urgently need another nanny.
Again?
You know how it is.. l know how it is,
Alisha. l know how it is.
Actually, the thing is, that this is the fifth nanny that has quit working at your house in the last three months. l don't think anyone will be willing to work at your place.
And don't feel bad.
You see, your daughter,
Tania, she's a bit of a challenge, you see. l don't think anyone will come to work for you because everyone is scared of her.
C'mon, Jasmeet, she's just six! So what's the big deal? OK, fine, fine.
Please help me out this time, l need to get back to the office and l'm really, really late.
Just this one time.
Hello, look this is very short notice. lf someone can come then she'll come to work for you.
But l'm not making any promises.
And if she does come then she'll reach your place by twelve o' clock.
That's fine. l'll wait for her, OK.
But this is the last time we are doing this, we can't send any more nannies after this time. l owe you one, Jasmeet!
OK, Alisha dear, take care then, thank you.
Again..
Jasmeet, l don't think anyone will be willing to go to her house.
So what should we do then, Jasmeet ? l have an idea!
- What?
Let's not do anything. Let's not send anyone to her house!
Let's not send anyone.
She'll understand then.
This seems like a good plan.
- lt's a good idea, right?
Ya!
- So it's done then!
Cheers!
- Cheers dear, cheers! To you too.
Hi! Hi! Hi! l'm Abhay. Abhay Sharma.
No, no.. just keep it simple.. ya.
Hi! My name is Abhay Sharma.
Hi! My name is Tony. Nice to meet you.
Yes. l know that and l will be. l'm just waiting for a new nanny and as soon as she gets here l will leave, l promise.
Yes, absolutely. Tania, you better not be throwing away your broccoli.
And no, this time that smile won't work, so eat it.
She's here and on time, fab!
God bless Jasmeet! l've been waiting for you for so long and now you're here..
But you're a man..
Ya, sorry, l'll..
No, no, no, nobody's perfect. l'll introduce you to Tania, you're gonna love her, she's.. you will love her.
Tania! Look, normally l don't keep anyone without interviewing them but the Jasmeets have sent you and l totally trust them and l'm.. oh my God, l'm so late.
So today we'll try you out and then we'll see.
Tania! And please finish whatever chores there are on the list before l get home because that work needs to get done. Tania! l'm eating!
- l don't care! Now!
Look, l think that..
Ya Mom, what is it?
Tania, your new nanny. Hi?
- Nanny?
Ewww! But he's a man.
Really? Thank you, Tania, because if you hadn't told me then how would l ever know that he's a man?
Come here, you be a good girl, OK? l need to leave, alright? Please behave.
OK, bye!
Bye! Please clean the house before l get home.
Actually l'm a computer software..
Don't you dare touch the computer!
Don't touch it. l have just understood it. l have just managed to figure it out, oh and l'll check your work when l get back. So just.. just know that.
Excuse me.. - CP, ya l've just left.
5 minutes. One second, hold on, ya? lf anything, anything at all happens to my daughter l'll chop you up into tiny little pieces and feed you to the animals in the Singapore zoo!
And have a nice day! Ya? OK. Yes, CP.. l'll sort it out as soon as l get to the office.
Hi! My name is Abhay Sharma. l hate you!
Look, l don't know anything about this nanny business.
But l can't even leave you home alone, right?
So let's do one thing, let's become friends.
OW! Tania!
Now get out of the house or else l'll call the police!
Police? But what have l done?
Nothing. But if l tell them that you were doing bad things with me, then who do you think they will believe? You or me?
Look, let's make a deal.
Let me stay here till your mother gets back and in exchange l'm ready to do anything for you. l'll do anything. Anything.
Anything?
Number 1 ! Clean the house!
Hey! You missed a spot.
Tania's homework!
Yes!
Back to work.
Piano lessons. Ewww! Yuck! Boring!
Don't worry. l won't ask you to play the piano. l hate it.
Because l'm going to be a rock star, and rock stars don't play the piano.. they play the guitar!
Oh, OK.
Hello.
- Hi! ls everything alright?
Ya! Everything is alright!
Where is Tania?
One second. Tania.. your mother.
Hi Mom!
Hey baby! ls everything alright?
You're not troubling your new nanny, right?
Am l troubling you?
No, not at all. ln fact it's a lot of fun here!
Not at all, mummy. ln fact it's a lot of fun here and l've even finished my homework.
Shut up! l don't believe it. l'll have to get home and check.
OK, l'll see you in the evening,
OK? Be good. Bye!
Bye!
Fetch!
Thank you la.
- Thank you very much.
Now repeat after me. My name is Froggy Four Eyes.
My name is Froggy Four Eyes.
And l'm a stupid fool. l am a slave to Tania. l'm a slave to Tania.
Cause she's very cool!
Cause she's very cool..
Tania?
Hi mommy!
Hi!
Oh my.. oh my God! l am.. l am so sorry about this.
Never mind.. it's, it's OK.. it's fine.
No, no, no, it's absolutely not OK.
Tania Merchant this is, this is just not done.
You can't treat people like this. l mean, look at this poor man, what have you done to him?
You think it's funny?
You think it's funny?
Because it's really not,
Tania Merchant, it's his niceness that he's stayed here for so long.
Anyone else would have left you alone and gone long ago. l'm really, really sorry, and thank you so much for.. l know that Tania must have troubled you a lot and l can see it.
But you see, l really need a nanny like you.
And it's OK that you're a man, it's totally fine.
Do you think that you could forgive Tania and take this job?
But Mom!
The thing is that l need to tell you something..
Ya, ya, sure! Totally!
Say whatever you need to say but please take this job.
You know. Just come with me one second. - Ya.
You see, no one has been able to handle Tania like this and l'm a divorced single working mother. lt's difficult. l'm ready to give you anything, l'll double your salary, how about that?
No, you don't understand what l'm trying to say. l've come to tell you something really important.
OK fine! Triple. But that's it OK.. please. l need to tell you something really..
Look. l really need you to do this.
Please say yes, just please say yes.
Please. Try it but say yes.
Yes.
OK.. l.. sweet!
Great, so since everything is settled, come tomorrow morning at seven and you can leave after finishing all the housework.
Just be back at three o' clock,
Tania comes back from school by then.
OK..
- OK.
What was your name again?
Uh.. Abhay Sharma.
Abhay Sharma. Hi! Alisha Merchant.
Nice to meet you.
You too. l'm really sorry about all that, really sorry. lt's, it's OK. G'night.
G'night
- G'night Tania. lt's.. it's OK.
You know how it is. OK, bye! l'll see you tomorrow.
What? You've become a maid?
Not a maid, Dad, they're called nannies here.
And you're the one who told me to go speak to her, so l went to speak to her and she employed me as her nanny.
Now what?
Now nothing, Dad. l'll have to clean the house, cook food, and take care of her daughter.
Ya! l almost forgot to tell you.
Alisha is a single, divorced mother who lives here with her daughter.
Daughter?
Ya, Dad! A six-year-old monster who is intent on ruining my life.
So wish me luck, Dad.. for my new job.
But.. but son.. she is a single mother, she has a six-year-old daughter and you still.. l know what you're thinking, Dad.
But all this doesn't make a difference to me.
For me Alisha will always be Alisha.
Anyway, l gotta go, Bye! Taxi!
Hold my bag..
That's it. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Hey, Abhay. You are a little late today, no?
But that's not important.
Actually, kinda is but anyway..
For today, things that you need to do.
Number 1 . vacuum and dust the living room. Number 2. Polish the silver.
Number 3. Remove the clothes from the washer and put them in the dryer, and put the clothes lying in the hamper into the washer.
And ya! Don't forget to separate the coloured clothes otherwise.. anyway.
The clothes for ironing are lying on the table, l'm sure you know how to iron clothes.
Ya, right! l'll talk to you soon. Bye!
Nobody answer the phone!
Ssshh.. everybody quiet. Thank you.
Hello.
- Hey, Abhay!
All OK? You got my note?
Ya, ya, ya! l'll do everything, not to worry.
OK, see you tonight.
Back to work everyone.
This is for the full week, ya?
Thank you, thank you..
Perfect!
So what would be your legal advice in this matter?
Do you know where Mr.
Siddharth Singh is right now?
Mr. Sharma, l do want to help you. l knew your father really well but you don't even know where Mr. Siddharth Singh is.
And you have no proof that he stole your software.
My legal advice would be that you forget about your software, you have no case.
Hello Mr. Sanghvi. l'm Alisha Merchant, welcome to Pinnacle. lt's our pleasure.
The pleasure's all mine Ms. Merchant.
And if you greet me so beautifully then it would be difficult for me to ever leave.

.. Abhay, why don't you stay for dinner?
Huh?
Ya! Stay for dinner froggy.

Dinner? Food? lt's necessary for survival. lt's not that big a deal.
Ya! Ok.
- Ok!
Sweet!
Coffee?
- Ya sure.
So that's your coffee, and there's some sugar and milk over there.
Thank you
- You want some ice cream?
No. No thank you.
- l'll get some.
So tell me. Being a man, how come you decided to become a nanny? l mean, this is usually a woman's job, l mean usually.
Ya.. actually.. l'm very fond of children and like taking care of them. l like it. l can totally see that.
What you've managed to do with my daughter no one has done so far.
So this job as a nanny is perfect for you, like perfect.
Thanks. Thanks.
.. Wife? Girlfriend? l mean if you don't mind me asking.
No, no l don't mind. l'm not married and l don't have a girlfriend.
Never really had one either.
Never.
- Never?
Never?
- Ya..
Shut the front door! How is that even possible?
Oh no! l'm sorry.. you like girls right?
Ya! Ya ya! l mean l was..

But l'm totally okay with it, gay rights..
Ya ya! No no! l really like girls. l love girls. l love everything about them.. you know. - lt's fine. Ya.. ok. l really really like..
Ok
Anyway, what about your marriage?
Oh.. l'm so sorry, l forgot.. l'm so.. so sorry.
No no no, it's ok. l didn't mean to..
No. lt's not a big deal.. l was very young when l got married. l mean l was what?
Like.. 1 8. And like it usually happens, the guy turned out to be a jerk and we got divorced.
After that l didn't want to stay in lndia any longer, and anyway it's not like he was interested in taking care of Tania.
So, when l got a job in Singapore, l took it and we moved here.
A new life, a new beginning.
Lets talk about something else ya.. ok.
And again l'm really sorry about..
Oh, it's fine.
- Ya? lt's fine.
- Ok
Don't worry about it. Ok
So, what work do you do in Singapore?
There is this software company called Pinnacle Technologies. l'm the PR and marketing..
Hi Mom! Came to say Goodnight.
Hey pumpkin.. who's that? varun.. l'll tell you.. hey!
Hey rock star!
- What's up?
Who's varun? l don't know.
Ok, Goodnight!
Goodnight froggy four eyes!
Ya.. so maybe
Alisha. Bye. Goodnight.
Oh bye, goodnight. Oh, no, no one.
That's just Tania's nanny.
Ya, so you were saying.
Hello Dad.
Abhay.. is everything alright?
No
- What happened? Alisha?
Son, the one girl you couldn't forget for seven years has come back into your life.
Do something so that she gets to know the real you.
And what will that accomplish Dad?
Well, anything can happen. Love?
C'mon Dad. This is Alisha remember?
She won't even look at guys like me.. this love is impossible.
Son, the ones who win in life aren't always the stronger, faster, clever ones. ln the end, the one who wins is the one who believes in himself.
The question here is, do you believe in yourself? l don't know Dad..
So then find out.
Because this impossible love story can only be made possible by you and no one else.
You're right dad. You're right.. let me call you back ya?.. Bye..
Good luck.
Possible..
Possible.. ya..
CP, you do understand how much of my time and effort has gone into developing this software?
Of course, varun. l completely understand.
Great! So then, according to you, how much would it all be worth?
A sum this large has never been offered to anyone before in the entire history of this company.
Mr. Sanghvi.
CP.. in the company's history this offer might be large but according to me it's not.
Alright, Mr. Sanghvi. Why don't you tell us what you expect?
Double this offer, give me a twenty percent partnership in the profits, and you have a deal.
You play hardball, Mr. Sanghvi.
Please call me varun. l may not like your methods, varun..
.. but l have full faith in this software.
We can seal this deal on one condition. lf l accept your terms then all your program files, your entire software and any other related work..
.. has to be handed over to me.
And all these files will be put into this company's secure server.
Sure. So do we have a deal then?
We sure do! Congratulations!
- Thanks.
Congratulations, Sir!
- You too.
Congratulations, Mr. Sanghvi.
Ms. Merchant, it was a pleasure doing business with you.
Well varun, l think you can now call me Alisha..
OK, Alisha. l think we should celebrate this moment. What do you think?
For sure!
Great! So then, may l take you out to dinner?
Well, logically, you are our guest.
So l should be the one taking you out to dinner. l'm okay with that! l'm sorry to interrupt but this software has to be put into the company's server right now.
C'mon, let's go. - Right. OK.
Boss is calling.
- Yeah! OK.
Come, varun.
- After you.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
This way.
As you can see, this facility is completely secure.
The internal network is directly accessed from here, and only senior personnel are allowed access to this room.
That's right. lt is your destiny, Luke!
No way, Jos!
- Jos? Who's Jos? He wasn't a Jedi!
Do l look like l care?
Look, Mom, l'm a Jedi!
Ya! And it looks like a lot more fun than homework!
What homework?
Tania! Tania! She's just kidding.
Until she finishes her homework l never let her play. Never. l'm sure.
Abhay, could l have a word with you? Upstairs.
Why? l mean ya, ya, sure!
Now?
OK.
Hello?
Abhay!
- Hi!
Hi! Come on in. Actually l just need some advice. A man's point of view.
Ya, sure.
Why don't these things ever work? l hate them, man! lf you like, may l?
You understand these things?
A bit.
Shut up! Really? Come. Come. Come. l never get network, it's like www-wayovermyhead.com.
Have a seat.
OK, so the problem is there's this guy in office, varun.
And he's asked me out to dinner.
That's not the issue, the problem is l work with him, you know.
And l know l shouldn't mix my personal..
.. and professional life but l mean technically, he doesn't even work in my office.
He's just like my client.
He's like really cute, you know how it is? - Ya, ya.
What should l do? l..
- OK, so l have two choices.
One, that l go out with him for dinner.
Alone, like a date.. but it's too early.
Two, that l invite him home, but that's just too intimate.
Unless l invite some people from the office as well?
Right!
- Ya!
That's great!
Because inviting everyone over for dinner will make sure the situation remains casual.
And it means we are still meeting for dinner. l like it!
Ya, me too..
You're fab. Thank you very much. l feel so much better now, really!
Any time.
Thanks! Oh! But listen, hey, we'll have the dinner tomorrow and..
Rohan, Madeleine, CP, Sumitra..
.. you'll manage cooking for six people, right?
Ya.
Oh! And l love Thai food. You know how to cook Thai food, right?
Thai food? Ya, ya! Of course!
Really?
- Ya.
That is so cool. You can do just about everything!
Ya!
G'night.
- G'night.
Shut up! You fixed this?
Why didn't you come into my life earlier, Abhay?
But it's never too late, so g'night!
G'night.

You guys sure? lt's true, Mom. You're looking mummalicious!
Hey!

Hi! Sumitra, l'm so glad you could make it. Please come in.
You look stunning!

Alisha, you did a very good thing by inviting varun.
So, then what's for dinner Alisha?
Oh! You'll find out soon enough.
First a toast!
Oh God! Why did he have to sit in the front?
To Unify?
To Pinnacle and Unify.
Anyway..
What are you doing?
Good evening.
For madam. Thank You!
What are you doing?
Amusing! l'm really sorry.. he just likes feeding people.. backwards!
CP, why don't we tell varun a bit about the presentation?
Ya, varun..
- Soup!
Strange!
Excuse me.
Abhay, serve the soup!
- No!
What do you mean, no?
Self-service! Thai tradition.
Apparently, self-service is a Thai tradition.
Self-service it is!
Maybe some wine.. voila!
For you..
So..
Madam..
Soup!
Oh my.. my china! lt's fine. Hi!
Continue!
Amusing..

Whatever! We'll talk about it tomorrow.
And these dishes?

Ya.

OK.

He just left.
Your wine
- Thank You
So where did we leave off last?
What the hell is this?
What's going on?
Tania! l'm really sorry, varun. Bizarre things happen to me quite often, but this one even l can't explain. l just.. lt's OK, you're still very beautiful.
Anyway, this means that you'll have to take me out to dinner again, or let me take you out?
We'll see.
- OK.
Goodnight.
- Sweet dreams. Here.
Souvenir, don't worry about it.
Aw.. thank you!
Thai tradition!
Hello Sidhu.
Abhay..
Ya.
Abhay.. good to see you again.
Please come join me.
Sit down. Please.
Cappuccino, right?
- lt's OK.
So, Abhay.. what brings you to Singapore?
You know exactly why l'm here. l've come looking for you, to take my software back.
The software that you stole from me, Sidhu. varun. The name is varun.
This is the problem with you people.
Always so serious in life, you've got to relax. Calm down. l'll relax once l get my software back.
See, you're going on about that again.
Abhay, l'll only say this once, so listen carefully. ln this world there are two types of people.
People like you, who make things, and people like me who sell those things.
And in today's day and age without people like me, people like you would be nowhere. l mean, take a look at yourself.
You still live with your parents in their house, and are a burden on them. That's sad.
Why would anyone want to invest in you? lts all about marketing, you understand what l'm saying, right?
Ya, l.. l understand. l understand very well.
But what you haven't understood is that..
.. if people like me don't make things, what would people like you sell?
And varun, whatever you say can't change the fact that eventually you're nothing but a thief.
Thief? That's a big word.
Abhay, l'm just a businessman, besides, do you have any proof?
No, right? Look Abhay, because you're a good guy l want to help you.
Abhay Sharma, right?
This is a cheque for 50,000 dollars, you can only dream of making this kind of money.
And this can be yours now, just take it and go back to lndia, and forget about this software. Take it!
You know, varun. l've spent my entire life living under people like you.
Even in college l would do their homework, finish their projects, submit papers. l would do everything, and the result was that people like you moved forward and l got left behind.
But now, enough is enough, l can't do this anymore.
So put that cheque away, varun..
.. because now l'm not like that any more.
Now l would rather help myself and not you all.
Wow! That's great but you're too late.
The deal is done, the software has been sold and in a few days it will be officially launched.
This money is the only thing you'll get out of this.
You want to help yourself, right?
Then listen to me, take the cheque. varun. l'm giving you another chance, return my software to me.
Or else what? What can you do?
Something l don't want to do. l'll have to show the entire world that you're a thief.
You're a fool. This is the difference between you and me. l've given you an opportunity to change your life but you don't want to take it.
You're forgetting one thing, varun.
Till l have this, my life is in my hands, however much anyone might try to rob from me.
And one more thing, you can change your life with this, not with that.
Good luck. Go for it.
The exit's there.
OK, varun.
Excuse me.
- Yes? l.. l'm looking for the recruitment office. Human Resources? lt's on the first floor.
That way please. - Thank you.
Ankert University, California? Honours student? Great qualifications. Good.
So do l get the job?
You know what kind of a job this is, right? l know, Sir.
You'll have to repair computers, that's it.
Sure, Sir. l can do that. l don't think you understand what l'm saying.
This job is not worth your while, its very simple, inferior work.
How can l give someone like you a job like this?
Sir, if you think this work is too inferior then think of me as an inferior man and give it to me.
OK. Come to work from tomorrow.
Sir, can l start from today?
Of course you can! By all means.
Thank you. Sir, l have one request.. l won't be able to come to work at nine in the morning as l have another job.
As soon as l finish that l'll come here.. if it's OK with you?
Son, with your qualifications, there are no time restrictions for you.
Just finish the work properly.
- Of course! l know this won't be too much trouble for you.
Thank you, Sir.
Ask Helen for your uniform and lD-card on your way out. - OK, sir. OK.
Alright.
- OK.
All the best, my boy.
- Thank you, Sir.
Take care.
- Thank you, thank you.
God bless you!
You will be happy to hear that the media is very excited about this.
Enquiries are pouring in so l have a little plan set up that l want to show you. - Let's go
How we'll take this forward, yeah? varun, do you think we can put this onto mobile phones as well, the software for..
Froggy! We're staging a play in school on Friday and the teachers have put me in charge.
And l don't know how l'll manage this so fast.
You'll have to do everything, Froggy!
You have to help me!
Of course l'll help you, Tania.
Anyway it's getting late, say goodnight, OK? Sweet dreams.
You like my mum, right?
Tania.. you shouldn't say things like this. Go to sleep, OK? Goodnight!
OK. But if you really do like my mum then l can help you out.
Help? Help how? l knew it! You like her!
You like like her!
No, no, no, when did l say this?
When did l say this?
You don't need to say anything, Froggy. lt's clearly written on your face.
Whenever mommy comes in front of you then you should take a look at your face.
You get that silly smile. lts so obvio!
Tania, you do know that you're just six years old, right?
Yes! But in these matters l'm your grandmum. So say!
What?
- That you love my mum, stupid!
Smiling won't help. lf you need my help then you have to speak up!
OK..
- Ya, OK, what?
Ya, OK.. l love her. l didn't hear you.. l love her, OK?
How sweet! But there's a big problem..
Problem? What problem? varun..
Ya, varun..
And if l know mom then he's just her type. She likes idiots like him.
What?
We'll have to do something, Froggy!
And we'll have to do it quickly or else everything will get ruined.
But what can we do?
Don't worry! l like you and l hate him.
Meet me outside school tomorrow.
Tania will take charge. Give me five!
OK!
So what's the plan?
The problem is that you're just not mum's type. l know.. - And to change you is also impossible.
So what should l do?
Nothing much. Just spend sometime with each other.. alone!
Alone?
- Ya, she has to get know you, stupid!
But alone.. where?
At home. l've planned everything. l'm going to be spending tonight at a friend's place, so that you two can be alone.
OK.
Now you go to your hotel and l go home.
That's sad. l'll see you tomorrow.
- Goodnight, sweet dreams.
Goodnight
- Goodnight.
No Tania, you can't watch Sex and the City!
Watch Hannah Montana.. OK.. lights out at 1 0 o'clock. Bye!
Abhay!
- Hi..
You're still here.. let me help you. l need some advice from you.. again!
Ya, sure! Of course.
You know varun? Remember the guy l spoke to you about and.. l think you met him at dinner.
- Ya, ya, ya..
Thai tradition.. so what do you think?
What do you think about him? l don't understand.
OK. l think. l think he's going to ask me out, like on a date.. officially.. and l don't know what l want.. so what do you think?
What should l do?
Well.. do you love him?
Love? No, no, no, no. lt's too soon, l mean.. and anyway.. love is a fantasy.
Not that l'm negative about love or anything. ln fact in school and college l used to believe in love and fairytales.
You know, l used to believe that my prince charming would come and carry me off on his motorcycle.
And someone did come into my life, except that he wasn't any prince charming.
Anyway, after that l stopped believing in these things.
Cause.. now if l find anyone who keeps me happy and more importantly accepts
Tania in his life, then that's all.
That's more than enough.
And do you feel that varun is that guy?
Maybe..
Well if he makes you happy then l mean, l mean you should do whatever makes you happy.
You're right. ln any case, what are you doing here?
All this can be done tomorrow. And even Tania is at her friend's place.
You could have had the evening off.
What would l have done with an evening off?
You know, l would have just got bored in Singapore..
Are you kidding?
Singapore is such a nice place, and the girls here are very pretty.
You're a single guy, you should be having fun. l can't do all this!
Why not? C'mon! You never know, right? lt's possible that some special girl is waiting for you here and she'll never find you because you'll be here doing the dishes.
Such special girls don't wait for guys like me.
What kind of logic is that? Why not?
Because just like you.. these girls are also looking for their prince charming..
Fine..
- Ya.. and l'm no prince charming. l mean take a look at yourself, you're a beautiful girl.
You're beautiful and..
Thanks!
You're welcome! lf you go out looking for men, there will be a line outside your door.
There's not going to be a line-up of girls waiting for me. l doubt it.
Do you seriously believe that people are attracted to each other only on the basis of their looks, cause that's really shallow.
Ya! l agree, but that's the way of the world. l didn't make these rules.
Well, it's a stupid rule.
Because there are so many other qualities besides beauty.
Like intelligence, charm, personality..
Really?
Ya, really!
And if l prove you wrong..
How?
Let's have a bet. l'll bet with you but how will you prove it?
What? Do you even know how to use these?
No! But that's the point.
C'mon, these are Tania's!
Even better! Black?
Do you like make-up?
Ya..
- Good! Time to take it off. l clean my computer screen with this!
Screensaver! Great! Now wear it.
And for the final touch.
And you?
Spare! Ready? l think so..
No way, man!
Yes way, man..
Are you mad? Who looks like this? l can't go out like this, this is totally embarrassing.
Makes me look totally stupid.
- So, bet's off? Give up? l win?
Come on!
OK, fine, fine!
Me here, like this.. what's the plan?
The plan is, you here, like this.. it's impossible that any guy will even glance at you.
What rubbish!
- Ya! - lmpossible! lmpossible according to me, but as you can see there are so many bars.. if you can get even one guy's phone number..
Then you'll believe me?
- Ya.
That's all?
- Ya, just keep it geek, yeah?
Ya. OK. OK. l can do that, that's simple.
Watch and learn.
- l will.
Everyone here may not be beautiful yet, two hearts can still meet.. lt's possible.
Hey.. it's possible
Through the sheer strength of my heart l will find someone
And if not love at least
A phone number l will get lt's possible
Hey.. it's possible lt can happen lt's possible lf it has to happen, lt can lt's possible
Maybe, but love..
.. ,love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
No, no, love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
No love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. l can make you feel good
With my stories
And make you laugh all night
Whatever you ever want l will give
And in my depths l'll have you lose yourself
The one who is near you ls truly blessed. lt can happen lt's possible lf it has to happen it can lt's possible
Maybe, but love..
.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
No no no no
Love impossible l say it's possible
Love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
We'll talk about random things
With tea
And at night
About fireflies
Your soft light laughter
With a pinch of sadness l'll give my heart away to you ln the midst of all this lf they could only see me
Not judge me let me be me lt can happen lt's possible lf it has to happen lt can lt's possible
Maybe, but love..
.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
Love impossible lt's possible, hey ya..
Love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. lmpossible lt's possible, hey ya..
No no impossible lt's possible
Love lmpossible lts possible, hey yaa
No No love lmpossible lt's really possible
Just not possible
Trust me it's possible
Love lmpossible l just can't believe how people can be this shallow. l'm.. l'm sorry. l'm just really upset. l'm sorry, Alisha. l didn't mean to upset you. lt's not your fault,
Abhay. ln fact, you were right! l guess these are the ways of the world.
Alisha.. l can't change the way the world functions but to me.. you'll always be beautiful. You'll always be special.
And if you ever need me, l'll be there.
Of all days, l think, today is the day l needed to hear that the most.
Thanks, Abhay.
Hey, check this out!
That's the new Air with the faster processor and, oh my God!
Does it have Snow Leopard? l didn't know it was, it was out..
What are you saying, Abhay?
You must really like these computers and things, ya.. lt's my second love actually,..
Second?
No.. what l mean is.. whenever l feel sad l come to a place like this. ln fact, in
Singapore l come here itself. l hate them by the way.. hey, varun!
Coffee now? l..
.. actually l'm with a friend right now, l don't think l'll be able to make it.. you're OK with that, right? OK. Bye.
Coffee?
- Yeah.. - OK..
OK, boys and girls.. rehearsal time.
Krish, come here, come here, come here.
You sing after me, OK?
Say bada bada boom..
Bada bada boom. very Good. Bada Bada..
- Move fatso!
So?
- So?
What happened last night?
Give me the goss, Froggy?
Nothing, nothing like that.. but it was nice.
Nice, huh? Sweet! See, l told you l would help you, right? l know. You're the best ,Tania. Thank you!
Now go try on your costume. l have to go.
OK, everybody. Tomorrow is the launch of the software.
Alisha, would you run us through the schedule please?
Yes, of course. OK.
So the event is scheduled to begin at
3 in the presentation hall and.. Oh! l think you should know that a number of channels will be broadcasting it live across the world.
Gotcha! l will begin the event. A little brief on Pinnacle, then l will go on to introduce varun who will present the software and then the floor will be open for questions and answers.
Alisha, l'm impressed.
Just doing my job, varun.
That will be all, thanks for coming. All the best.
Bye..
Alisha!
- Ya! lf you're not doing anything tonight.. would you like to go out?
Oh, varun.. tomorrow is a very big day and l think we should both get some rest. Some other time perhaps?
Ya.. for sure, yeah. You're right!
We need to get some rest.. ,for sure but is everything alright?
Ya! Of course. Good luck for tomorrow!
Good luck to you too!
- OK.
Mom! My school play is tomorrow, you remember, right?
Of course, T. - You have to be there for the whole play.
Obviously! ln fact l've told CP that l'm going to be coming late for the launch, how cool is that?
Cool! And Froggy, you have to be there too!
Of course, Tania. l'll be there.
OK, now enough, go to sleep, OK?
OK, Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Hey, Froggy! l'm sorry, goodnight sweetheart.
- Goodnight.
Ya.. keep this with you.. there you are, sweet dreams.
Goodnight!
- Ya, goodnight!
Abhay?
- Ya?
Coffee? l'm making it so you know it'll be special. l'd love to, Alisha! Yes, Alisha!
You can say anything.. anything. l'd love to. lf you don't mind can l ask you a question? lt's a little personal.
Ya, ya, ya.
- Don't look so worried.
No, no, no. Please.. please ask.
OK. So last night you told me about your second love, right?
So, l'm presuming that there is a first love. l know you've never had a girlfriend, so what's the deal?
You really want to know?
Ya.
So, ya.. there was a girl.
The truth is that l'm still in love with her.
Oh! That.. that's really sweet.
Wow! Who is she?
There is a girl. lt's been seven years now and she still doesn't know. ln fact, she doesn't even know who l am.
Wait a minute. lt's been seven years?
Oh my God! You're such a loser!
Ya.. ya..
That's ridiculous! You mean to say that you've been in love with this girl for seven years and she has no clue?
You know that's stupid, right?
- Ya.
Any girl would want a guy to be madly in love with her. ln fact, she'd fall in love with you there and then!
Oh really?
- Ya! lf she does that she'll be making a mistake.
She should love me for me, not just because l love her.
Anyway, where is she nowadays?
Probably having coffee in some corner of the world.. with some loser.. you know how it is?
Alisha.. l want to say something to you..
Tell me.. l don't know what you'll think once you hear what l have to tell you.. l'm not really sure..
Try me..
Surprise! Surprise! varun?
- A little something for you.
Thank you!
Well aren't you going to invite me inside?
Of course. Please come in.
- Thank you!
So how you doing? Everything OK?
Ya, ya.. varun that's Abhay..
Abhay that's..
You? What are you doing here? l could ask you the same thing, varun.
You both know each other?
Ya well.. - l was going to tell you everything Alisha..
How do you know him?
Abhay is Tania's nanny. He takes care of the house.
Nanny?
Nanny!
Hi! Nanny. He's no nanny.
He's been lying to you.
His name is Abhay Sharma and he is really my nanny.
He's a madman who's been following me from lndia.
He's been trying to steal my software.
He wants to steal it and fool us all, right? He's crazy, Alisha.
By living in your house, he wants to use you to get to me.
That's a lie, Alisha.
A lie? So tell me, haven't you been following me from lndia?
Yes, l have been following him.
- Thank you!
Because the software is mine!
He's stolen it from me.
Your software? lt's his software?
You're lying again? l'm not the liar, you are.
- l'm the liar?
Ya
- l'm the liar? One second.
Alisha, why don't you ask if he's a nanny at all?
Alisha, please don't listen to him.
So answer his question then, Abhay.
- Please.
Are you a nanny or not?
No.
Exactly!
And l'm sorry for that, but this software is mine. l was going to tell you everything, Alisha.
Please give me a chance to explain.
What's left to explain? l trusted you, with Tania!
Your daughter? With this thief? l.. forget your software, Abhay.
Do l even know you?
Alisha, please, you've got to believe me. l can't, Abhay! l just can't!
Don't do this, Alisha, please!
Just go.
Alisha..
- You gotta leave.
Alisha..
- Now! You gotta leave now! - Alisha!
Please leave! Now! Leave now and don't come back.
You'll be OK?
Ya.. ya l'll be fine. l'm.. l'm sorry, varun. l think.. l think l need to be alone for a while, and anyway tomorrow is a big day for all of us.
Sure. But if you need to talk then just give me a call.
Ya, l will..
Take care.
- Ya..

Hey Mommy!
My superstar! You were so good!
But Tania, who told you this story?
Froggy!
But how would Froggy.. lt's been seven years now and she still doesn't know. ln fact, she doesn't even know who l am.
The truth is that l'm still in love with her.
Oh my God!
What happened, mommy?
And where is Froggy?
Why didn't he come?
He didn't come because of me. lt's my fault.
We'll have to look for him.
We have to find him.
C'mon Abhay, pick up the phone.
Have you and Froggy had a fight?
Kind of.. Tania, l think l made a big mistake and to fix it l'll have to find Froggy.
So where will we find him now? l think l know where l can find him!
Ladies and gentlemen. l welcome you all here today..
Firstly, l would like to thank you all for being here.
We at Pinnacle are proud to present a revolutionary new software..
We believe this software is going to change the face of the industry.
Mom! Don't waste time!
Ask the manager for help!
Ya, ya, ya, you're right!
Mr. varun Sanghvi.
Excuse me.. Hi! You see, this is an emergency and l need to make a really important announcement. ls that possible? Cause it's really important, you know.
Like ya!
Hello.. l'm looking for Abhay..
Abhay Sharma..
God, l hope you're here..
Mom.. c'mon! l got it. lf you're listening, Abhay.. l want to say something to you.
First of all, l'm really sorry.. that l didn't believe you last night. l should have known that you could never do anything like this.
You'd never deliberately hurt me,
Abhay, because you love me. l'm the girl you've been in love with for seven years.. and that night you were the one who saved my life and all those other things. lt was.. it was always you.
You always thought that l'm too good for you like l'm some princess who can't love you. l'm just a girl, Abhay, who's always looked for love in the wrong places.
When actually, true love was always in front of me.. l just couldn't see it..
'cause that's just me..
.. l'm stupid like that. l'm just a girl, Abhay but with you l feel like a princess..
So please just come out
'cause you're not the loser.. l am.
God, l really hope you're here.. l've always been here.. l'm..
Just don't..
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Today indeed is a great day.
A day when the entire world will come a little bit closer together.
Pinnacle Technologies and myself will present to you a software that..
Abhay, l know this software is yours.
A path breaking new Operating System..
Let's go!
So without further ado, let me show you what Unify can actually do.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the future!
Find Alisha quickly!
- l'll just check.
Would you excuse us a minute please?
What's the problem, varun? What is happening? l.. l don't understand. l checked everything yesterday and it was working fine..
Can you fix it? l'm trying to..
Alisha! This launch was your responsibility..
.. and you're coming so late! l know that ,CP.
Everything is falling apart!
Do something. Fix it! Now! l'll.. l'll OK.. varun, l think l.. l'll just..
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. l have a very important announcement to make here today.
The reason why Unify is not working is because Mr. varun Sanghvi is not..
.. the original programmer of this software.
What?
Alisha, what are you doing? l'm really sorry, but varun is not the original programmer of Unify.
Just.. just trust me. Please! l'd like to call upon the original programmer of this software.
Mr. Abhay Sharma.
Alisha! Have you gone mad?
You know l've developed this software, not that crazy guy! varun, don't..
- Alisha, explain!
CP, you trust me, right? Just listen to Abhay once, that's all l'm saying.
CP..
- varun, shut up!
CP.. what is happening? l just can't take this! varun. l want to hear what he has to say.
Thank you! Abhay.. l told you, varun. l also gave you a chance.
You didn't listen to me. Now l'm sorry. Sir, he's a fraud.
He met me in Mumbai, stole my software and came to
Singapore to sell it to you.
Whatever he's said to you is a lie.
He's nothing but a thief.
CP, this man is crazy.
Anyway, what proof does he have?
The proof is in front of your eyes, sir.
What do you mean?
- On the screen.
OK, so you're responsible for all of this? lf he locked the software with a password what am l supposed to do?
And how did he get access to the..
- Ya! l've done it.
But according to you, you made this software. - Yes, of course!
So if that's true and anyone locks it with a password, then you should be able to bypass it easily.
Sir, a real programmer would know this software so well that he'd easily be able to restart it.
CP!
- Just ask him to start it!
CP! l don't know what he's talking about!
Just get the password and get him out of here.. varun, why don't you do something?
Because he can't. You know that even if you want, you can never restart it because you never created this software.
CP..
- Abhay, can you start this software?
Ya, l just have to enter the password and it'll start.
Fine! Fine!
You bastard!
What is it? What's the password?
Give it to me. l'll give you the password but you'll have to promise me that you'll
Give Abhay the exact same deal that you gave varun. Exact same, CP.
OK, promise. Exact same.. now give me the password.
OK, what is the password?
You give the password..
Abhay, l don't know the password.
What's the password?
Of course you know what the password is, Alisha. lf you don't know then who will..
Can one of you please give me the password? Please!
Alisha! Alisha!
That's your password CP..
What?
Alisha.. my name.
Congratulations! Today you've become a really rich man.
Sir, this way please. l.. l think l should. l think you should..
Just say it.. l love you.. l know..
Froggy! So you finally gave the play a happy ending, right?
Ya!
- Come here, you. l told you, son.. it's possible.

In 1933 "Aliat HaNo'ar" was established to save children from the danger of extermination at the hands of the Nazis.
During and after the war its representatives continued to gather children from their hiding places and brought the survivors to Israel where they built their homes.
Scores of youth villages were set up for this purpose and they absorbed 300 thousand children and adolescents.
The movie "Under The Domim Tree" is dedicated to this marvelous organization.

Over here!
They've found him.
We should have taken care of him.
"There" we always took care of him.
Now the two of us are all alone.
Two of us are not all alone.
We should've gone with him.
Don't even think that way.
We couldn't have done anything.
Nothing at all.
Summer, 1953
My dear Aviya,
I'm going to Germany.
To see about our reparations.
Maybe things will finally work out for us with this money.
I went to see your mother.
She's still in the psychiatric ward.
It seems that she'll be there for a long time.
Enclosed are two photographs of your father.
I have a better one somewhere.
If I find it,
I'll send it to you.
Take care.

Money can't pay back the murder of millions.
It's not about the Holocaust
I'm talking about my family..
Calm down.
- Isn't it enough that they killed your parents?
Shut up!
It's not about the money.
It's a matter of principle.
Money for blood.
No reparations.
And that's final.
But it's money, Yurek.
Money.
I deserve that money.
It won't bring your Parents back to life. -No.
But at least I'd have something for my future.
We're not talking about you.
We're talking about our country.
Quite please.
Where are your manners?
You're in the dining hall.
I'm sorry, Rachel. They've been arguing since yesterday.
There's no argument.
We all agree, except Sara B.
Zevik, I can hear you even when you don't shout. Sit down.
But I'm the monitor.
The committee has to discuss this before the children...
Rachel, they are old enough...
- Later
I want to introduce to you a new girl who's joining us.
This is Miriam Segal.
- Mira.
Excuse me?
- Mira. My name is Mira.
This is Mira. I'm sure you'll help her fit in, and make her feel at home.
Good luck, Mira. -I'm Ariel.
Let me introduce you?
Ayala, Aviya, Daniel.
She'll be in your room.
Pass me a knife. -Tell her she can take off the hat.
Zevik, the tea's not hot.
- That's what there is.
Don't I eat get any fish?
Vegetarian table.
- I don't eat grass. look what she's eating.
Miss Sarah B is on a diet.
She's not like the other fat girls in the group!
No, Miss Sarrah B is special, she's from Warsaw.
Stop Shouting.
You're making me death.
You look like your from the ghetto.
Yurek's little servant.
Did you hear that, Yurek?
I'm from the ghetto.
Always on Yurek's back.
- leave him alone Sarah.
The bed unfolds like this.
In the morning, you fold it back under the other bed.
Every morning. Why can't it stay out like the rest?
I'm not a sucker.
- Who said you were?
Every year we draw lots for the shelves and the beds.
Who was here before me?
Dita. Her mother married an American millionaire and took her to America.
- Yeah, sure.
This is your shelf.
Put your things here.
Where's your suitcase?
- This is the all I have.
When your shoes are dirty, you leave them outside.
What a figure Sarah.
Congratulations.
It's "Bez" in Poland now.
- No, it's not.
What month is this?
No, in Polish.
June. "Czerwiec".
- Yes, "Bez" in June.
The leaves are already dropping, and when you walk on them they make a sound like: crik, crik, crik.
No, it sounds like:
Chak, chak, chak.
Leaves fall, girls.
They fall.
And you step on them.
Fall. Drop.
What's the difference?
"Bez" is in October,
In the autumn.
And the snow is up to here.
And when you walk on it, there's no sound at all.
I have soap in my eyes.
Isn't there a laundry in this institution?
There is, but we wash our underwear ourselves.
It's personal.
It's your own.
I don't care about the
Poles or the Fascists.
Yurek, why do you get so angry when we talk about it?
Say your sorry or
I'll kill you. -Kiss my ass.
Stop it.
Yurek, what about?
- They're going crazy again.
Yurek.
- Run, run.
What are you staring at?
Get inside.
Why are you all standing there like that? It's late.
Tell them to stop?
Don't you dare open it?
Nobody raises their voice or their hand to me.
Go stop them now.
- They'll stop by themselves.
I've been telling you for months that they must be separated.
If you don't do it, I will.
- Not now.
You don't learn from your mistakes. Need I remind you? of Misha? -Are you saying
Misha was my fault?
I'm not saying that?
But you don't want it to happen again, do you?
Everyone here thinks he's an expert.
It's the first time they're like that since Misha drowned.
I thought they were cured.
Will they be like animals all their lives?
If you want to talk, go outside.
I want to sleep.
Look at them now.
Acting as if they're normal.
Shut up? Pain in the neck.
- I knew mental cases like them.
Shut up.
- Hey, what's going on here?
It's because of yesterday's discussion.
Things I want to forget keep creeping into my head.
You're not the only one, chavy.
I think... -You think?
I think...
We have the right and the obligation to talk about it.
What do you say, girls?
I wasn't "there".
I have no right to judge.
I think we should take as much money as we can.
Shut up. You're both sabras.
Don't yell like that.
I say we should take as much as we can.
I need the money for my future.
All you think about is money.
No blood money.
End of discussion.
In the end, everyone will take the money.
Do you want to bet?
I'm ready to bet with anyone.
Sarah, what do you mean by
"my" money, "my" future?
We all have the same future.
Building the Kibbutz together.
Do you think I want to spend my life in this group?
I've had enough all these years.
I want to wake up alone.
Go to sleep alone.
Without 4 other girls.
I've had enough of all this "togetherness".
I want to go study.
Succeed. Alone.
Did you hear that Yurek?
I've decided to break up with Sarah B.
Then I'll break up with Ayala.
- But she's not your girlfriend.
If she were,
I'd break up with her.
What do you think of Ayala?
For me or for you?
What do you say?
For you, for you.
Woman give me a headache.
I give up.
Are your hands clean?
This is for you.
Very funny.
He's mad because
I tell him what I think.
You can't take it when someone disagrees with you.
It's tough for you to digest.
- Digest. What Hebrew?
We should all learn from Sarah B.
- I digest, you digest.
Laugh. Even my Hebrew's better than yours.
Right Yurek?
Aviya, come here for a minute.
Who me?
- He's talking to you, isn't he?
What's your answer?
- To what? -My letter.
What letter?
- The one I just gave you.
You gave me a ball of paper.
- Did you throw it away?
Read it.
So?
- What?
What did you want?
I liked what you said today:
"I wasn't there.
I have no right to judge".
Is that why you called me?
- No.
I like how you speak.
Short. Staccato.
What?
- Staccato, "ta, ta, ta, ta."
Is that good or bad?
- Typical Sabra.
What?
Well.
- Wait a minute.
What, do Sabras shake hands?
Here comes Vim.
- Hi Vim.
Oudim Family, let's welcome our friends returning from Holland, led by our dear
Vim Van Fliman.
To them, he's a hero of the Dutch underground.
To us, he's a simple gardener and leader of our Dutch group.
O.K. One moment, please.
This is really wonderful.
I. O.K. Now I'll speak in Dutch, because I can't find the words in Hebrew.
I was visiting her majesty
Queen Juliana, with my Jewish children that I hid during the war.
Enough. I'm O.K. now.
I have a surprise.
The sack, please.
This sack has gifts from my friends in the Resistance, for all the school.
But I need "volunteers".
Who wants?
- Me! Me! Me!
For Vim's a jolly good fellow.
Yes. That will do.
What happened?
- It's your fault.
"Unfold the bed, fold the bed".
Everything's falling apart and it's not my fault.
You're wasting your time.
It'll just break again.
How long has this envelope been here?
You know that you're in charge of the mail this week?
Why are you making such a big deal?
Since you arrived, there's been nothing but problems.
Go cry under your stupid tree.
For me, you don't exist.
And if you call me a bitch again,
I'll smack you both.
You understand Polish?
- "You understand Polish?"
Vim?
- Yes.
Why did you take the tractor?
We're planting.
- Are you crazy?
Planting Tulips in the summer.
It's too hot.
We're planting Tulips to the north.
You're wasting your time.
Poor children.
There's not even a drop of water here.
I read in book.
Once, many Tulips in Israel.
Soon, this place very beautiful.
What's this?
"Nabatean Farming".
The Nabateans lived here over 2,000 years ago.
The Nabateans know the secrets.
Soon, will be miracle here.
What are you doing with the stones? You're nuts.
The Nabateans...
We shape the stone to catch water.
And who told you, you could take the tractor?
It's O.K.
- No. It's not O.K. at all.
I'll talk to Rachel about this.
"Home sweet home we go".
Can I come with you?
- Not this time Yurek.
We have a wonderful house with a tile roof.
You stick your head out the window and plums fall into your mouth.
I'm not sure you'll get along very well with my mother.
You can gossip in Polish?
I forgot that horrible language.
This time I have to go alone.
I'll take the photo out like this?
What?
What is it?
- Untie it.
Your hair. Untie it.
Tie it up.
You mean braid it?
You "braid" hair.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
My Dad would be happy.
- And his wife?
I'm going to see him, not her.
I like it here when everyone's gone.
At last, I get some privacy.
What, do Sabras shake hands?
Last one to the gate, washes the floor.
Is he coming?
He said he would come today?
Mama,
I brought you flowers.
I grew them myself.
- Henya, you have a visitor.
Don't talk to her like that, she's not a little girl.
Do you want to go out for some fresh air?
You're not dressed warmly enough. You'll catch a cold.
I'm O.K.
It's very warm today.
Yes, warm.
Who gave you that photo?
- Aunt Alice.
She sent it to me before she left.
She went to Germany?
To get our money from the Germans.
There's no reason to go there.
They're all dead. I saw.
They're all dead, in the woods of Narosdj.
Is this my father? -My father, my brother, my husband, they're all dead. I saw.
- Mama, you weren't there.
You came to Israel before the war.
Don't tell me where I was.
You fool. You know nothing.
Isn't this from "there?"
Isn't this from "there?"
- What is that?
Is the doctor blind?
Shut the windows, I don't want the neighbors to hear.
They don't need to know what's going on in my house.
Tell me about him, mama.
I have to know.
It says here "Kaybeach".
Who's "Kaybeach?"
From Haifa.
- I want the nurse.
I'll call her in a minute.
You have to tell me. Please?
I need to know.
Who's Kaybeach?
Tell me something, Mama.
I have to know.
We're alone again, Yurek.
Just the two of us.
That's not enough for you.
You want to be all alone.
"Alone" means you and me.
What do you see in her?
Is it her braid?
I can make one too.
You mean "braid" one, Sarah.
You braid hair.
Stop, Sarah.
It's over between us.
What we had can never be over.
It's forever.
Then promise me we'll stay friends?
No matter what.
Always.
Did you hear?
They found Yola's father.
He's alive in Poland.
- What? -Yes.
Avi, why are you back so soon?
Didn't you go visit your mother?
Did you hear?
- Yes. -It's unbelievable.
They called me into the office.
I saw Rutka, the nurse, sitting with Rachel and Ariel.
Then, Rachel hugged me and said:
Yola, it's a miracle.
You are not an orphan anymore.
They found your father.
He's alive in Warsaw, in Poland.
We've heard that story, it's getting boring.
You should be ashamed.
My father's alive.
Can you believe it?
He's alive.
It's amazing.
My father is alive.
He had these big "Lappas".
- What?
Lappas.
Big hands.
That used to wrap up my little hands.
Soon, Yola. Soon you'll be holding his "Lappas".
I'd give anything to see my father just once.
Do you remember him?
He died before I was born.
Maybe it's better that way.
To be an orphan from the start.
Sometimes, memories can kill.
So, how's Yola?
- So how's Sarah B.
You didn't go see your mother, did you?
Leave me alone. I have enough problems. -What do you mean?
You and Sarah B.
I saw you together, as if...
As if what?
It's over between me and Sarah.
It's final.
I missed you.
Yurek. Avi.
Wait a minute?
Can I come with you?
It was just by chance, right?
What happened to Yola,
It couldn't happen to someone else, could it?
Am I right?
It's a miracle.
What's this?
- To Yola.
It's for me.
- Yola, when you're in Poland, try to find this man for me.
- Janek Tilas.
- He's my father.
- Thank you and come back soon. Menachem Tilas.
"Mailbox For Letters To Poland"
Where's Yola? She received a package from Poland.
A package arrived?
What a tiny dress. Doesn't he know how old you are?
He probably remembers you when you were little.
No. This dress isn't for me.
When I was small,
I had a doll this size.
It's for my doll.
I'm sure he just wanted to make me laugh.
O.K. girls, let's get Yola ready for her trip to Poland.
We'll embroider her shirt.
- No, two.
One for the trip and one to celebrate the Sabbath.
Shoulders, 87.
Boobs.
79. You got bigger.
Waist.
Tushie.
A package arrived from Poland?
- Not now. Later.
Try this on.
- It's so beautiful.
Try it on.
- I can't.
My aunt says that it's forbidden.
You only buy new things for a baby after he's born.
Let's see how you'll look when you meet him.
Let's pretend you just got off the plane.
Wearing Israeli clothes in Poland. Can you imagine?
In Warsaw, with the clothes we made.
Yola.
Only 60 more hours.
Lod - Zurich,
Zurich - Paris,
Paris - Vienna,
Paris - Vienna, yes.
Vienna - Warsaw.
- Vienna - Warsaw.
Miss Yola Mintz.
Miss Yola Mintz.
Not Yola, Yolanda,
Yolanda Mintz.
If he hears Yola, he won't know it's me.
People only call me
Yola here.
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Wait. I forgot.
How do you say:
"How are you?"
And "Where have you been all these years?"
Right.
And
"I love you Papa?"
Come on, let's pack.
First the winter clothes.
We'll put that in last.
And last but not least,
Rutka's coat.
Wait, we forgot something.
Bon voyage, Lalka.
Not so much water.
Just a little.
Vim, are you sure it'll work?
Look.
A plant needs three things:
For the body for the heart, and for the head.
Water, for the body.
Love for the heart.
And the Nabateans for the head.
But, it's a secret.
Yola, Rutka wants to see you.
Don't dance with anyone else.
I'll be back.
Whoever is not in this group, please leave now.
Your counselors are waiting for you.
My dear children.
I have no words of comfort.
We all shared in Yola's joy, and now we share her grief.
I know that it's difficult.
- Where's Yola now?
In her room.
She's been taken care of.
I have a lot of letters for Poland.
What shall I do with them?
I'll take care of it, Yola.
- No, I will.
We must end this.
Come with me, Yola.
Wash her face.
Lie her down in her room.
And close the shutters.
Yola, go rest.
It's heavy.
Damn. I can't stop myself from crying.
I'm O.K. now.
Yola wants to return the clothes you gave her.
There's no hurry.
- It can wait.
Go rest, Rutka.
Yes Rutka. I'm O.K.
Here's your coat.
I just want to unpack the suitcase.
Why is Chavy crying?
Is she sick?
Don't just stand there, help her.
Look at what my aunt sent me.
For my trip to Poland.
I didn't even try them on.
My aunt sent me long underwear.
She's completely crazy.
She wants me to travel like this?
I ask you. To Poland.
Do you travel to Poland like this?
Dressed like this?
Do you travel to Poland like this?
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Do you travel to Poland like this? Like this?
My father will run away if he sees me like this.
What hysteria.
You would think.
She thought he was dead, didn't she?
Well now she's sure.
- Shut up. You monster.
You're better off.
- Shut your mouth.
One day you might go to Poland, and you'll be able to visit his grave.
Get out.
You filthy.
Stop.
Stop it immediately.
Wash your face.
Take your things and go to your room.
Look at what those animals did to me.
I could kill them one by one.
What did I say that was so terrible?
At least she knows for sure that he's dead.
Think about it.
All those thoughts.
Alive. Dead.
Now she knows that he's dead, and she can visit his grave.
Who else here has a grave that they can visit?
The most important thing is a grave with a headstone.
Do you hear me?
I'm talking to you.
Is there anyone up there?
I can hardly see.
I'm up here.
I'll be down in a minute.
"Kaybeach, Haifa"
Are you running away?
I'm not going anywhere, and you didn't see me.
Cause if you leave,
I'm taking your bed.
Where are you going in Haifa?
Uptown or downtown?
I don't know.
I don't know the city.
I'm going to visit someone that I don't know.
Stick with me. I know Haifa like the back of my hand.
Do you know someone named "Kaybeach?"
Kaybeach,
Kaybeach.
You can't live with a name like that.
Kaybeach is the area of cemeteries.
That's where I'm going.
Who are you looking for, my dear?
Your brother?
Your father?
- My father.
Was he in this regiment?
He died before I was born.
This is the military cemetery.
The older graves are over there.
"Max Alexandrovitch"
Papa.
Papa.
I brought you this flower.
It's from Holland.
Vim gave it to me.
He's our gardener at the boarding school.
I work with him.
Mama's very sick.
That's why I'm at the boarding school.
Watch over her, Papa.
And watch over me too.
I need someone to watch over me.
Yurek.
I did it. It's unbelievable.
I found him.
I found my father.
What's wrong?
Was Ariel looking for me?
This day is the most...
The most...
I think...
- Listen,
I have to do what I think is right.
We have to take care of the problem once and for all.
Don't worry. I won't let them be separated.
We'll come visit you.
You'll come visit us.
Zevik, Hadassim Boarding School is a great place.
It's a lot like our "Oudim".
Yurek.
Come on.
We'll come visit you in a week or so.
Have a safe trip.
- Don't worry.
So long, Zevik.
Guys, gather around.
I owe you an explanation.
Zevik is on his way to Hadassim...
He's going to Hadassim...
Take the dogs away.
Naomi. Listen to me.
They're search dogs.
Calm down.
They're here for the search.
This is all your fault.
We'll find them.
Do they have family. or friends? Anyone?
No. But they can live like this for months.
Like this? Outside?
They lived 2 years in a forest "there".
They were like animals when they were found.
Not "Like animals".
They were animals.
Don't ask me.
I don't have any answers.
But all these years that you've been together.
We don't talk about what happened "there".
I didn't tell them anything about me either.
What does anyone know about anyone else.
Even best friends don't know anything about each other.
But that can drive one crazy.
- So you go crazy.
But for how long?
Maybe for good.
Maybe for life.
Remember last winter when we searched for Misha?
We passed right through here.
I'm not going back there.
You're wasting your time.
They'll come back.
What's your problem?
Do your feet hurt?
Why are you making such a big deal?
If you were missing, it wouldn't be such a big deal at all.
Somebody should look down.
In the water.
Please eat.
We must continue searching.
It sticks in my throat.
I have a bad feeling.
You always think the worst.
Stop it.
I'm afraid to think what could've happened.
What could've happened?
There they are.
I told you they'd be back.
Either we stay together or we die.
You'll stay together, of course.
You'll stay together.
Let them breathe.
Come see.
The stupid psychologist is leaving.
Are you happy now?
Stop, Yoram.
Enough, Yoram. Yurek.
Stop, Yoram!
Yurek, turn of the water.
Stop the water.
Save it for the tulips.
Daniel.
Don't walk on Tulips.
What's going on now, Vim?
Why did you take all the hoses?
Couldn't you have left me even one?
Why are you making holes?
Are you crazy?
Look.
The water drips. Drip-drop.
- Drip-drop?
Drip, drip, drip.
Drip-drop.
And who'll pay for new hoses?
Maybe your Nabateans?
My invention.
Congratulations, Vim.
This is an agricultural revolution in Israel.
You should patent it.
- Maybe.
Hi, Yorem Klein.
- How do you like "Yoram"?
"Uri"?
- What's wrong with "Yurek"?
I want to change my name.
- Why is a name so important?
I don't understand.
- You can't understand.
Your life's another story.
- Do I even have a story?
I have a great life.
I'm on vacation here.
We shouldn't argue so much.
Maybe we should go out and have some fun.
And what about Zevik?
- Zevik's my problem.
He's not your problem.
Zevik's your problem.
I'm your problem.
Everyone's your problem.
- Don't be so dramatic.
You have no problems.
You have a wonderful house, you stick your head out and plums fall into your mouth.
You know what?
Let's go have some fun?
Let's go visit my mother.
Aviya, where are you taking me?
You said we were going to visit your mother.
Mama?
This is Yurek.
Mama, can you hear me?
I found him.
His name was on the tombstone.
I'll take you there.
We'll go together.
Just get out of here, and everything will be fine.
There's nothing left "there".
- Mama, you weren't there.
She wasn't there.
It's all in her head.
Speak to her in Polish.
Mama, he is from "there".
He speaks Polish.
Where do you live?
- Same place as Aviya.
How's your father? -My father?
I don't have one. -Your mother?
How's your mother?
- Mrs. Alexandrovitch?
What did she say?
She told me about the house, where you stick your head out the window, and plums fall into your mouth.
Some people want to forget where they've been, and others want to remember where they've never been.
How do you pronounce the letter "R"?
Mine sounds so foreign.
"Yurrrek".
But I like your rolling "R".
I want to pronounce it like you.
They say...
- Yurrrek's Aviya's Boyfrrriend.
No. "Ruthi runs by the Ararat River".
No. RRRuthi rrruns.
Come see.
Rruthi rrruns.
You have visitors.
Don't tease me.
Nobody came.
Who's here?
Nobody.
Tell me! Who is it?
- Some people.
What do they look like?
- I don't know. People.
A man and a woman.
They're short.
Wait! What should I tell them?
She's crazy.
My mistake.
They went on a trip and they'll be back late tonight.
We should've called first.
I have to go. Leave whatever you brought for her here.
That's her shelf.
What do you mean?
We don't have anything.
Why do you care so much about her?
Why don't you air out her smelly sheets?
That's exactly what I'm doing.
You're terrible, Ayala.
- She won't notice.
It looks better like that than it usually does.
What's with you?
Why are you doing this to her?
I owe it to her, OK?
Ayala! Stop it!
- Can I come in?
She hasn't returned yet?
It'll be morning soon.
We'll have to start a new search.
No, she'll be back.
After Zevik and Yurek,
I just don't know anymore.
They always come back.
Except Misha.
- Misha.
Right, Misha.
Get it into your head.
It wasn't your fault.
I can't believe we're waiting up for her.
I'm afraid something happened.
I'm awake.
I'm awake.
Why are you all awake so early?
We never went to sleep.
We were waiting up for you.
- Who made my bed?
Mira, are you OK?
Let us help you.
- Are you OK?
I'm taking off your dirty socks, OK?
I brought you some food.
Eat.
It's good.
You must eat.
Those people.
They're horrible.
They found me in Naples.
In Italy.
We arrived there by ship from Poland. -I told you.
I don't remember anything.
Except that I was in an orphanage. -Which one?
It was called "Dom Jetzka".
- That means "Children's house"
They're all called that.
We were in
"Dom Jetzka Jerusalem"
One day, they brought us to Israel.
The boat was filled with children.
Girls?
- Come in, Ariel.
Mira, we were worried.
Are you O.K.? -She is fine.
Sit. She's telling everything.
Go on.
Those people found me on the boat.
They said they we're my parents.
They bought me a big doll.
We lived in Afula.
Everything seemed fine, but I always knew
Something wasn't right.
Then she got sick, and he lost his job.
And he started to... my back is covered with scars from his beatings.
I couldn't stand it anymore, so, I ran away.
I never want to see them again.
I could kill them.
What's wrong with her?
What's going on?
Mira, what happened?
- Its them. Those people.
Miriam, wait.
Sir, the office is over there.
No need for police.
Miriam Segal is my daughter.
This is my wife,
Miriam's mother.
We want to see her.
She doesn't want to see them.
This is a scandal.
Let us see our daughter.
Please. Go to the office.
They'll help you.
What are you? Fascists?
Stealing peoples daughters.
She doesn't want to see you.
Please?
- He has a bad heart because of the Germans.
We only want to see our daughter!
Stop them.
- Please?
Is this how you steal children?
You should be ashamed.
I'll see you in jail.
Miriam?
- Come home with us?
Please?
You just wait.
This is just the beginning.
Can the court decide whether they're her parents?
We all dream that someday someone will come.
A father, a mother, someone.
From "there". And she.
I don't remember anything, but I know they're not my parents.
Then what do they want?
I bet it has something to do with the reparations.
If she can't remember, maybe they really are her parents.
Mira.
Calm down.
You have an excellent lawyer.
Everything will be fine.
You'll see.
Good luck.
- Good luck, Mira.
It'll be alright.
- Good luck.
Stop!
Tell Moussa to stop!
Mira?
- Stay there. I'm OK.
I must have eaten something.
Sit up front. OK, Moussa?
- No problem.
Get in, my child.
Sit.
Good morning.
Let's go.
Take the hat off, Mira.
But I like it.
You have nothing to hide.
You're so pretty.
You have lovely eyes.
"DISTRICT COURT
OF TEL AVIV"
I'm sorry, but you can't come inside.
Good luck, Ofra.
We're counting on you.
Mira, remember what we said?
- Stay calm and don't get upset.
- Let's go in.
All rise.
Approach the bench, please.
I suggest that you try to find a way, to avoid this hearing.
There's no room for compromise.
She must return to her parents.
- They're not my parents.
Your Honor, I'm sorry for the Segal's and the girl they lost in the war.
But they can't just replace her with another girl.
Before hearing the testimony,
I recommend that Mr. Segal take a blood test.
What?
- Although the blood test...
No test!
No blood!
Don't you believe
Jews here?
They already experimented on us.
Isn't that enough?
Wasn't Auschwitz enough?
- Me too. This is from Hitler.
All we want is our daughter.
Mira, daring.
Come with us.
How can you concentrate on trigonometry now?
Yes. They had a daughter?
She was four or five years old.
Today she must be big.
Then you can identify the girl?
Mr. Rosenberg, do you recognize the girl?
That's the girl.
It was years ago, mistakes have been made.
Maybe.
So here and there new families were created.
Nobody gets hurt.
But in this case,
I'm not mistaken.
But Mira's teacher testified that she noticed signs of violence, and suspected that Mira has been beaten.
I knew that the family. had survived the Holocaust.
That there was tension in the home.
Fears and rage.
Maybe they did hit the child from time to time.
Then they did beat her?
- Your Honor, this is irrelevant.
The issue is not whether they're ideal parents, but rather whether they're her parents or not.
And I state that they are.
I want you to wear this.
It'll look very nice on you.
Tell her to wear it.
It's brand new.
I've never worn it.
Quiet please.
- I told the judge that it was important for you to be with Mira.
You're everything she has.
He's agreed to let you sit inside, but you must all behave yourselves.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I've heard the testimony.
The time has come for my ruling.
Mira, Mira.
Don't worry.
My child, you claim that these are not your parents.
Then who are your parents?
Try to remember.
Your mother?
Your father?
A sister?
A brother?
Nothing.
I don't remember anything.
Try to remember something, someone?
Your Honor, the situation is very clear.
The girl has no evidence to refuse the claims made by her parents.
She must go home with them. for everyone's good.
These people claim that they're your parents, and that they love you.
If they're mistaken,
I need to know how they are mistaken.
Make an effort.
This is very important.
Give me a sign?
Anything?
Otherwise, you'll have to go home with them.
I think they were taller.
My mother was taller.
Am I tall or short?
When my children were little,
I seemed very big to them.
When you were little, you looked at your mother from down here.
Mira, you have two people here who want your happiness.
After all you and they have suffered, why don't you just go with them?
- I'd rather die.
Mira, think for a moment.
Miss...
We must move on.
Blue... -I have no choice but to rule that the girl...
I remember the color blue.
I can't hear you, my child. Speak up.
- I remember the color blue.
When I looked up at her, from here,
I saw blue.
She had blue eyes.
Very blue.
Not like mine.
They were blue.
She had dark eyelashes, like butterflies...
I can see her face.
I see my mother's face.
I see my mother's face.
Her teeth stuck out a bit, like mine...
My brother had the same teeth.
My brother, Antek.
His name was Antek.
Antek Rozner.
My mother is Ella Rozner.
My father is Menachem Rozner.
My name is Miriam Rozner.
And we lived in
Lubartovska St. in Lublin.
My name is not Segal.
They're the Segal's.
I want to be who I really am.
I want my name back.
How could I have forgotten them?
How could I have forgotten you, Mama?
And Papa?
And Antek?
How could I have forgotten my mother?
Don't leave me. I wanted so much to remember you, and I couldn't.
Please don't leave me.
I wanted so to remember.
Mira Rozner!
Mira Rozner!
"An old straw hat, and a wrinkled shirt,
"Not fancy you must say, "But we don't mind, for all day long,
"we laugh and sing away, ha-ha!"
We're going there the minute we arrive.
Where?
I can't wait.
Stop!
What is it, Vim?
Come and see.
Avi?
We can't go there now.
It's occupied.
The Domim tree is occupied.

As soon as you feed, Senator, you won't need these anymore.
Holy shit!
It's the attack of Grandpa Munster!
Gross.
Damn it.
Sorry to ruin your party, Senator.
Don't worry, we'll have you out of here in two minutes.
- Thank you.
- Edgar! Aah!
Alan? Alan!
Alan!
Alan.
Alan. Alan, are you okay?
No. No, Alan, no. No, Alan!
Alan!
I am a vampire.
Oh, yeah?
Well, abracadabra. I'm an umpire.
Hocus pocus.
Mr. Frog?
Yeah?
Were you sleeping?
I work nights.
- Apparently not hard enough.
- Hmm.
You're in default on your loans...
...and the bank is repossessing this property.
This would include any...
...structure currently on the property as well.
- Are you serious?
- You have one week to vacate.
Have a good day.
Fucking vampires.
Cash or store credit?
Cash.
Comes to 65 even.
Sixty-five dollars?
Are you kidding me? I mean, this issue of Destroy All Vampires number 125...
...in nearly mint condition is worth 50 bucks alone.
In near-mint condition.
I know near-mint condition and that ain't it.
What are you talking about?
I haven't even opened this book.
It's been boarded and bagged since the day I got it.
Well, let's have a look.
There are stress marks at the staple points.
The, uh, cover has lost at least 15 percent of its gloss...
...the pages are yellow...
...and there's significant rubbing and fading at the corners.
Hmm.
Now, if you were willing to part with that Batman number 14...
...I, uh, might be able to do a little bit better.
That's not gonna happen.
Happens to have some sentimental value to it.
That's my offer, Frog.
Take it or leave it.
All right, pay me.
Have a nice day.
I hate happy people.
- Hmm.
- Hey, Edgar.
Did you make any money off of Frank?
Are you kidding?
He gave me 65 bucks for everything.
Ugh. He's such a cheapskate.
Here, let me see.
Uh, not that one.
But there's still some good stuff in here.
You want me to put it up on eBay, see what I can get?
Uh, sure, why not.
Every little bit helps right now.
Where do I find the graphic novels?
You mean comic books.
No, I mean graphic novels.
I don't read comic books. I'm not a geek.
Hmm.
- Oh, well, I can't help you then.
Here at the Book O'Neer, geek is chic.
- Try Barnes & Noble.
Whatever.
I guess you don't want me to spend any money here.
That guy gets on my last nerve.
- You know him?
- By reputation only.
His name is Jonny Trash.
He's a celebrity blogger.
What the hell is he doing here in San Cazador?
- They're here for the X-Party.
- The X-Party?
- What's that?
- A rave.
And it's gonna be here?
If you believe the rumors.
But they're not telling anyone where it's gonna be until the night of the event.
Great.
Sounds like the final nail in my coffin.
What...?
Bye.
Oh, shit!
Who the hell parked...?
My truck.
You sure don't look like a cold-blooded, meaner-than-hell, badass vampire killer.
Excuse me?
You're Edgar Frog.
Sworn enemy to nightcrawlers and bloodsuckers the world over.
I'm sorry, lady.
You must have me confused with somebody else.
I'm Gwen. Gwen Lieber.
- Hi.
- And there is no confusion.
You are the same Edgar Frog that destroyed covens...
...in Santa Carla, Luna Bay and in Washington, D.C.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Can we go inside to talk?
You got two minutes.
It's my brother, Peter.
He's been kidnapped.
A couple of years ago, he started getting into trouble.
He was hanging out with all the wrong kind of people.
Hmm.
And three weeks ago, he went to Ibiza to this rave party thing...
...and he disappeared.
He started following around this guy, DJ X.
He throws these events called X-Parties.
Yeah, I've heard of him.
Hi.
The same people that are throwing this party...
...are throwing similar parties all over the world.
And at these raves, they're handing out this new designer drug.
It's called the Thirst.
- It comes in little ampoules like this one.
Why would I care about...
...a bunch of drug addicts with glow sticks?
Because the Thirst is not a drug.
It's vampire blood.
Nobody has seen him since.
Edgar, they are using these raves to breed an army of vampires.
They're creating their own global pandemic.
They've already infected hundreds in Spain.
Done the same in Thailand, Rio and in Greece.
And now the rumors say that they're on their way here.
I'm not interested.
Look, I would obviously pay you for your trouble.
And this could well be the last time that you would have to do something like this.
All of my research suggests...
...that the Thirst is made from the blood of the head vampire.
- The head vampire.
- The bloodsucking alpha.
- The alpha.
- From the Greek, "root"...
...meaning the first.
The original.
I knew that.
I'm still not interested.
And your two minutes are up.
I'm staying at the Hotel Cazador.
I truly hope that you'll reconsider.
I know you couldn't save your brother...
...but, Edgar, maybe you can help me save mine.
Hmph.
Go and check on our guest, would you?
Hi, handsome.
How are you feeling?
Hmm. Poor little thing.
Just try to relax.
This will all be over soon.
Why would anyone jump out of a perfectly good airplane?
Because it's so fucking fun!
You make sure our package arrives in one piece.
And send someone to take care of Frog.
DJ X...
...the man behind the machine. I've been whoring the fuck out of your next party...
...on my website, and you can't even text me back?
You know how many media impressions that is a day?
Don't put your hands on me, man.
I don't even know you.
That's our head of security, Kirk O'Dale.
There...
...now you know him.
Well, just wait a minute.
If you don't give an interview right now...
...then I swear I'll make it my personal mission in life...
...to make sure that no one goes to any more of your stupid parties ever.
Well, we wouldn't want that.
After all...
...ever is a long time.
Step into my office.
I've got the blues
I've got the blues
I ain't got nothing but the blues
I ain't got nothing but the blues
Why did you go?
Ugh. Creepy.
Why did you go
And leave me here with the blues?
And leave me here with the blues?
You left me sad and you left me sore
You left me with the lowdown blues
Hello, Edgar.
What brings you all the way down here?
Now I have to have an excuse to visit my own brother?
At 1 in the morning, yeah.
I figured you'd be up.
I've recently learned there's a nightcrawler...
...who's created a new designer drug that he's handing out to kids at raves.
The only problem is it's not a drug...
...it's vampire blood.
He's breeding an undead army...
...and the only thing that stands between him...
...and the annihilation...
...of the entire human race...
...potentially...
...would be us.
The Frog Brothers.
We haven't been the Frog Brothers for a long time.
I just...
- I can't do it without you.
- What about Sam?
Sam's gone.
He turned, and, uh, I had to do what I had to do.
I guess that cancels out
Michael and Star.
Yeah. I'm pretty much persona non grata with the entire Emerson family at this point.
- Laddie?
- He's moved on.
He's got a wife, kids.
He's got a real life now.
- Yeah, well, so do I.
- You call this a life?
- This from a guy who lives in a trailer.
- Okay, so I've got nothing.
But at least I know what side I'm on!
Alan, if this is the head vampire, then maybe we can kill him.
If we kill him, then we just gotta find the one above him...
...and then on and on like that forever.
- They are telling me that this is the alpha.
The O.G. Of all bloodsuckers, the head vampire.
It's a pyramid scheme, Edgar.
Always has been.
What if this is it though?
What if this really is the head vampire?
Get this...
...and get it good, Edgar.
As far as I'm concerned...
...there's no such thing as vampires.
Hola, Trashynistas.
I'm sitting here with the one, the only...
...DJ X.
I'm sorry for those of you who have a shitty connection.
I guess you'll just have to take my word for when I tell you...
...the man's absolutely scrumptious.
They'll just have to come and see me in person.
Yeah, well, they'll just have to get in line. Ha, ha.
So, DJ X, why do you think the detached and the...
...you know, the disconnected youth of today have latched on so fervently...
...to your parties?
Because I create a place...
...where all the lost souls of the world can come together.
A place where they can do what they want...
...whenever they wanna do it.
Yeah, you heard it straight from the man himself...
...all you lost boys and girls. This is gonna be the biggest rave of the century.
And we'll let you know where it's gonna be an hour before this event...
...so stay tuned to this website for the deets.
That was a great interview, X.
Thank you so much.
No, no, thank you...
...for getting the word out.
I wanna have as many people at this event as possible.
It's my pleasure.
And I mean that.
So anyhow, what do you guys have to drink in this jalopy?
You.
Death to all vampires.
Maximum body count.
We're awesome monster bashers.
- The meanest.
- The baddest.
Edgar.
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.
Lots of weapons.
Lots of really expensive, custom-made weapons.
Well, of course. Come in.
Hmm.
Please have a seat.
So aren't you the least bit curious on how I know so much about vampires?
Not really.
I know who you are.
You're Gwen Lieber. Bestselling author of the Eternity Kiss series.
First of which is about to be made into a major motion picture...
...coming soon to a theater near you.
Oh, you've heard of me. I'm flattered.
Don't be. Your books suck.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Doesn't really matter what I think.
You've got millions of emo-goth sheep all over the world...
...who eat up every last word of it, and keep coming back for more.
I'm sure you've made quite a nice living off your supernatural bodice-rippers.
I'll have you know, I have gotten glowing reviews from every major periodical.
Bought and paid for, I'm sure.
Just like me.
What is your problem, Frog?
My problem?
My problem is you glorify vampirism.
You make being a vampire look...
...sexy.
Well...
...there has always been an element of eroticism in vampire mythology.
There is nothing sexy about being a member of the undead.
Well, perhaps I have made a serious mistake in coming to you.
If you came to me expecting me to ask for your autograph, then yes, you did.
But if you came to me expecting me to kill a shitload of vampires...
...that I can do.
Don't like the stake...
...maybe it needs a little garlic?
Here we go.
Freshly served.
Shit.
Eat that.
- Frog.
GWEN Edgar, it's Gwen.
Can you come by my hotel right away?
It's rather important.
All right. I'll be right there.
Hello, Edgar.
So, what's so important you need me to come down here right away?
Well, I thought you should meet your new partner.
When you turned me down,
I was desperate, so I hired someone else...
...and I'd really feel bad making him come all the way from Hollywood for nothing.
Hollywood?
I don't like the sound of it. Who is this?
Lars Von Goetz?
Lars, this is...
Oh, yeah. The Toad.
Frog.
- Edgar Frog.
- That's what I said.
Yeah.
I'm Lars Von Goetz.
But you already knew that.
And this is Claus, my camera operator.
So let's go kick the shit out of some little rave punks, huh?
But first, I gotta eat.
I got the metabolism of a 12-year-old boy.
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Right.
Never fear, Lars Von Goetz is here.
As long as the check clears.
Lars Von Goetz?
You hired Lars Von Goetz?
- I thought you'd be happy.
- Happy?
First you expect me to kill a head vampire...
...then you expect me to babysit some reality show reject?
You're not going to have to babysit him.
Haven't you seen his show?
The man's wrestled a grizzly bear, a lion and an alligator.
He's amazing.
That was staged.
All reality shows are staged, okay?
Von Goetz, whatever his name is, he's a fraud.
Vampires are, like,
10 times stronger than grizzly bears.
- Well, I think he can take care of himself.
- We'll see about that.
That creepy guy's looking at me.
Oh, gross.
Here's the deal.
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.
Right. You said that.
I'll go see my guy tomorrow.
- You don't want me to come with you?
- No.
He's a little twitchy about new faces.
Listen, buddy, if you're looking for the diet frozen-yogurt bar...
...it went out of business last summer.
Actually,
I'm looking for a Batman number 14.
That's a very serious book, man.
Only five in existence.
Four, actually.
I'm always looking out for the other three.
Edgar, since I know...
...I'll never be able to talk you out of what you're about to do...
...I can't let you go up against a potential head vampire without giving you this.
One of the first books on vampire hunting ever written.
It'll hopefully keep you safe.
Watch your back. Alan.
P.S. If you're still alive on Tuesday, be sure to call Mom.
It's her birthday.
ZOE Book O'Neer.
- Hey, Zoe.
I need your help with something.
- It's important.
Sure.
I'll be waiting.
Wow, so the Gwen Lieber hired you to find her kidnapped brother?
Yeah, and I think this book might help me figure out...
...where they've taken him to.
I need you to scour it for any clues, anything you can find.
I don't see how this old book is gonna help you find anyone, but I'll give it a try.
Do me a favor.
If you happen to run across anything in here...
...that talks about human sacrifice or anything like that, make note of it.
All right.
Cool.
Uh, do you wanna tell me why?
Not really.
Could put your life in danger.
Okay.
Oh, my gosh.
Where's Frog?
Back off, fucko!
Or what? You gonna mace me?
Somebody needed a light?
Frog.
Ugly.
You're dead.
Suck on this.
Watch out!
Nice.
Mace?
Holy water.
I feel like pancakes.
Order up.
I found a whole section of young male vampire sacrifices.
And look, there's a Blood Moon.
They call it that because the moon's face is deep red or crimson hue.
So they're gonna make a sacrifice under the Blood Moon.
Exactly.
This Friday is a Blood Moon.
So they're gonna sacrifice Peter at the rave.
- Well, Edgar, you can't let that happen.
- All right, if I'm gonna do this...
...I need to find out where the rave is and I need to find out fast.
Well, technically, raves are illegal...
...so the promoters aren't gonna say where it is until the last minute.
You said that the rumor is that it was gonna be here in San Cazador.
Even if it is here,
San Cazador is a big place.
If we're gonna find out where that nest is...
...we need to learn how to think like a vampire.
Bloodsuckers have a tendency to look for a place...
...that's got a history of suffering and death.
You know of a place like that here?
There's an old slaughterhouse on San Cazador Island.
Slaughterhouse?
Perfect.
Nothing vampires love more than blood and carnage.
If there's a slaughterhouse on that island, that's where they'll be.
Let me go.
- I promise, l...
- Uh-uh-uh.
Let's not make any promises we can't keep.
You just lie here like a good piece of veal...
...and maybe I'll bring you a nice glass of warm milk.
Hmm.
So where are we going?
My friend likes his privacy.
The name's Blake.
Used to be a congressman before he learned the truth.
What's up with all the razor wire?
Yo, Blake. Open up.
It's Edgar.
Whew. Edgar.
- How's it hanging?
- What's up, Blake?
Holy-water grenade.
- Nice touch.
- Yeah.
- Needs a little work, though.
- Yeah.
Who the hell's this?
Oh, this is Zoe.
She's cool.
Yeah, I'll be the judge of that.
Touch the cross. Do it now.
Zoe, manners.
- Nice to meet you.
- Blake.
What's with the bike?
Oh, that's a beauty.
I've been working on her for a full year.
Renovations, the lot.
She's gonna be a real killer.
Yeah. Unfortunately, wouldn't do us much good on this mission.
What else you got?
Welcome to the lair.
What happened to this thing?
Looks like something blew up in the barrel.
You should see the vampire
I was pointing it at.
Let's just say the gun came out on the winning side.
Nice new stuff, Blake.
I like it.
You looking for something to replace your Old Reliable?
Never.
Ah, you say that now.
Feast your eyes on this.
An old Russki RG-6 grenade launcher.
Whoa.
Heavy.
Fires 40 mm fragmentation grenades.
Not this one.
This one fires these.
What is it? Holy water?
Mixed with a little garlic.
Just for giggles.
- I'll take it.
- I thought you might.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
What's this?
Hey, put that down, please.
Very carefully, okay?
That is a prototype resin grenade.
I stole it from a military testing facility at Groom Lake.
What does it do?
- Oh, shit.
Cool.
Yeah, cool.
I will take that other resin grenade, though.
Gotta hand it to the grays...
...they sure are good at making weapons.
Well, it's a pleasure doing business with you, Edgar, as always.
Mm.
Say, you guys wanna stay for dinner?
I got beans.
Yeah, you do.
What the hell are these?
Those?
- Those are, uh...
- A reminder.
Vampires.
They must have tracked us here.
What did you do to them?
- High-powered UV lamps.
Edgar, all the weapons are in the car.
I guess we're gonna have to improvise.
They've taken out the UV lights.
Hi, sweetheart, aren't you gonna invite me in?
No. You're not invited.
Wait. Where are you going?
Holy shit, we gotta get out of here.
They'll kill us if we go outside.
I'd rather be bit than burned.
Come on, let's go!
- Hi there.
- Guys, get down!
Say hello to Old Painless.
Now, that's what I call a stakeout.
It's cool, right?
Yeah, it should be. It's my design.
If all of these freaks go to the island and take the Thirst at the rave...
...we're gonna have a full-on vampire invasion on our hands.
Okay, man, you got the glow sticks?
Let's roll.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yes.
Hey. You didn't tell me...
...Lars Von Goetz was gonna be here.
Yeah.
- I was kind of hoping he wasn't.
Oh, yeah.
That guy is a total animal.
Yes, baby.
You see the episode where he wrestled the grizzly bear?
- Missed it.
Oh, yeah.
Toad.
Hmm.
So, hmm, who's your friend?
Hi. I'm Zoe.
Zoe.
Tell me, Zoe, is it just me...
...or is there some serious chemistry between us?
That's just you.
Okay.
Edgar.
I hope you brought your bathing suit.
I thought we should blend in with the other partygoers.
Covert infiltration.
It's a good idea.
Hi, I'm Gwen.
Yeah, I know.
I've sold, like, a bazillion of your books.
- I'm Zoe.
- Right.
You work in a bookstore?
Part-time.
And Edgar thinks that you're qualified for this mission?
Just how many bloodsuckers have you killed, Miss Lieber?
- None.
- More qualified than you.
Well, this is Edgar's show, and I trust him.
Did I mention I hated her books?
So do I.
Rave!
All right, everybody.
According to the blueprints...
...there's an entrance to the slaughterhouse through a series of underground tunnels...
...which will lead us directly to where the rave is.
Now, remember, everyone, there will be a lot of civilians around.
Toadies, not familiars.
Just innocent partygoers who are all there because they think they're gonna have...
...fun.
Because of this, you will be armed...
...with weapons that are non-lethal to anything with a heartbeat.
This is a sawed-off, pump action,
Soak and Destroy water gun.
Patent pending.
Turns holy water...
...into holy slaughter.
Zoe, you take it.
Claus...
...it's a high-powered UV torch.
Tie it around your waist.
You'll thank me later.
Edgar, what about me?
You're staying here.
The hell I am!
This is my brother we are talking about.
I understand that...
...but this is not one of your books,
Gwen.
Everybody on this mission is a trained veteran.
You could be killed, or worse...
...you could be turned into one of them.
Okay, time out.
Listen, Gwen, I totally buy into your little vampire goth games...
...that's what you're paying me to do, but I'm calling bullshit.
If Gwen wants to go, she can go.
Not as long as I'm in charge of this mission.
It's all right, Lars.
Listen to him.
Edgar knows what he's talking about.
He's an experienced vampire hunter.
Wrong. I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you...
...but there are no experienced vampire hunters...
...because there are no vampires.
They do not exist.
Hmm.
Zoe, take these stakes, strap them to your leg.
And why does she get stakes?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were Mr. Tough Guy...
...who wrestled a 6-foot alligator with your bare hands. You don't need weapons.
No, it was 10-foot.
- And I still want stakes.
- Fine.
There's some stakes.
Why are hers metal?
You get what you get.
Let's go.
Edgar, wait.
Bring him back safe.
I'll do my best.
Move out.
Hey, Toad.
Couldn't we come back at night?
It would look so much better on camera.
No. Vampires feed at night...
...and I don't plan on sticking around for dinner.
Is this the VIP room?
Oh, most definitely.
- When's the party supposed to start?
- Not for a while.
You guys got here early.
Oh, are those promise rings?
- So cute.
Is that blood on your face?
Oh! I think I just broke my coccyx.
Forget the coccyx, is the camera okay?
Radio check.
Check.
Check.
Check.
All right. Once inside, our main objective is to extract Peter.
Killing vampires is our second priority.
All right, everybody...
...let's rock 'n' roll.
Heads up.
Hey, did you name your new gun yet?
Shh.
What?
Did you name your new gun yet?
What are you talking about?
All guns need a name.
Like boats.
Boats are for sailors...
...guns are for soldiers.
I'm no sailor.
- Lars.
What?
I'm getting a really bad feeling about this.
Ugh. What, you mean being deep within the earth beneath a thousand tons of rock?
Are you feeling "Claus-trophobic"?
Get it? "Claus-trophobic"?
That's not funny.
I'm serious, man, look around you.
This shit's freaking me out.
Jeepers.
All right, here's the deal.
We're gonna go to the left, you guys go to the right.
Zoe, you're with me.
Lars and Claus, do whatever it is you do.
We'll reconvene back on the beach...
...maybe.
You know,
I kind of hate the fact we split up.
People in horror movies always split up and they always get killed.
There's nothing to worry about, Claus.
Don't you get it?
This is all some stupid role-playing game.
All we're gonna find is some little emo goth kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.
You think this is a game?
Of course I think it's a game. Why else would the Toad give me a water pistol?
Besides, my fans are tired of seeing me tackle every natural predator on the planet.
Now, we need to give them something new to watch.
But if you're right...
...you're gonna be beating up a bunch of kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.
I know.
Isn't it great?
This is the entrance to the slaughterhouse.
Time for Mr. Frog's wild ride.
Ow.
Claus, we gotta find a place to do my intro.
Oh, yeah.
This is perfect.
Okay.
Using my tracking ability, we've located the nest of the vampires...
...deep within this abandoned slaughterhouse.
It's also haunted...
...by cannibal pirates.
It's built on an ancient Indian burial ground...
...where they used to burn witches.
Oh.
A promise ring.
Virgins.
Vampire filet mignon.
Ugh. What kind of fucked up shit is this?
Are you Peter?
Please, help me.
Dude. Turn around, let's go.
- What?
- It's too early to find him.
We gotta find him at the end of the episode.
I haven't even had the chance to put the beat-down on any goths yet.
- But he's right here.
- Dude, turn around.
Sorry, Peter. Let's go.
What the fuck?
Where are you bastards going?
Something smells really bad in here.
It's a slaughterhouse.
I don't mean the typical bad slaughterhouse dead meat smell...
...I mean I smell something...
It smells like rotting garbage.
Trash.
Yeah, like I said. Rotting garbage.
No.
I mean Jonny Trash.
Jeez Louise.
Jeez Louise? Really?
Zoe, get down!
You hear that?
What?
I think it's coming from down there.
What are you doing?
Lars.
Lars.
Dude, where's my gear?
You left it up...
Oh, shit.
What?
Oh, okay.
Is this it?
I've been waiting 300 years for a good fight.
Have you had enough, punk?
Nice outfit.
That's funny...
...that's exactly what I was thinking.
But I still have to kill you.
I'm surprised.
By what?
You're really not that good.
- Aah!
Edgar!
Zoe. I got this.
Ah, shit! Damn bullets!
See, now that's what happens when you don't name your gun.
Just pull out the sword!
- On three.
- Okay.
Three.
What happened to one and two?
Edgar? Edgar? Oh, God.
Lars, what's your 20?
- It's not Lars, it's Claus.
- Claus, where's Lars?
He's dead.
Lars is dead.
We're so completely and totally fucked.
Claus, calm down. Just breathe.
We have to get Edgar out of here before reinforcements arrive.
- Oh, my God. Zoe, what happened?
Just help us lay him down.
Claus, first-aid kit.
Hang in there.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Hold this.
Edgar, stay with me.
Notice anything unusual about Santa Carla yet?
No, it's a pretty cool place...
...if you're a Martian.
Or a vampire.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
You think you know what's happening around here, don't you?
Well, I'll tell you something.
You don't know shit, buddy.
Yeah. You think we just work in a comic-book store for our folks, huh?
Actually, I thought it was a bakery.
This is just our cover.
We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
We're fighters for truth...
...justice...
...and the American way.
Edgar.
- Edgar.
- What?
- What happened to me?
- You're okay.
Did we get him? Did we get Peter?
Claus found him, but they ran into some trouble.
They had him tied to some twisted table kind of thing...
...pumping him full of drugs, trying to keep him sedated.
Where's your boss? Von Geek?
Some big-ass, massive juggernaut of a vampire got him.
Tore his heart right out of his chest.
Got it on tape, though.
I'd like to see that when you get a chance.
- He'd like that.
- Thanks.
Gwen...
...it's gonna be okay.
We'll get him.
It's not over yet.
Payback's a bitch.
Damn straight. Let's go.
Rave! Rave!
It's starting.
All right, come on.
Hey!
Hey, there.
Do you wanna party?
LILY And now, the man you've been waiting for, DJ X!
Are you ready for a sacrifice?
Blood, blood, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
Hold up.
Oh, my God. There he is.
If they get through that fence, we're so undeniably fucked.
The sooner we take out X, the sooner that won't be a problem.
Okay, but what about Peter?
All right, listen up, everyone.
I want you all to hold back.
I've only got one shot at this.
I'm gonna immobilize X and then we go in for the kill.
Everybody, stay put. Got it?
- Got it.
- Good.
Put on something nasty, X.
I think I found someone
I wanna dance with.
He dropped it. I'm going in.
Zoe, wait.
Get in here and help me. Come on.
That is exactly how I'm going to break your neck.
Vinyl still shreds.
Very creative, Frog.
But when it comes to killing...
...I prefer more traditional methods...
...like impalement.
Claus, cover us!
Shit. Shit.
You fought admirably.
But you were doomed to fail from the start.
I've fought beside great warriors...
...learned battle techniques...
...that can only be mastered over several lifetimes.
And do you know what the first rule of combat is?
Yeah, don't monologue.
There's a lot of vampires down here.
Guys, I can't hold them off forever.
Fuck me. Fuck me!
Edgar!
Nice work. I've got it.
You're right. Impalement is good.
Especially when you pierce the heart.
Peter.
All right, everybody, listen up.
The party's officially over.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
Peter, can you hear me?
- Eew.
- Buckets of eew.
Edgar, something's wrong.
Yeah, I'd say.
No, I mean we killed DJ X, but I don't feel any different.
Something's wrong.
They're still vampires. Nothing's changed.
Edgar...
...this smells like garlic.
Garlic?
Let me see.
You're right, it...
They were keeping him weak.
You're the alpha.
Oh, I bet you did not see that coming.
Thanks to you.
If X had been able to drink my blood during the Blood Moon...
...my power would have passed to him...
...and that would have been a shame.
I've been the alpha for a long, long time.
You'll never grow old, you'll never die...
...but you must feed.
I brought you Edgar Frog, just like you asked.
Now it is your turn.
Remember your promise to me.
I just don't wanna grow old. Sorry.
Oh...
...you won't.
They're all yours!
Alan, wait!
No, no, no, this is not a good time for the batteries to die.
Claus, I need you to get Zoe to safety.
Edgar, I'm not leaving without you.
If we don't kill Peter right now...
...there's gonna be a thousand emo-goth vampires out there.
I need you to warn the world.
Especially in case I don't survive.
That's not an option.
I'll be waiting.
Just go.
Come on.
Claus.
I'm disappointed in you, Edgar.
This is no way to treat your savior.
Savior? You got a funny way of looking at things, kid.
I saved you from a life of Ioneliness.
You didn't want to end up like Robert Neville, did you? Ha, ha.
Robert who?
- You really should read more books, Edgar.
The ones without pictures and word balloons.
Robert Neville, the protagonist in I Am Legend.
Last man on Earth in a world full of vampires.
Is that really what you want to become?
I'm not thirsty.
You'll have to kill me first.
I will, if necessary.
But that would be a shame...
...especially since I owe you a debt for killing X.
Why didn't you just kill him yourself?
A father can't murder his own children.
That would be in bad taste.
Even an impertinent little shit like DJ X.
I told him you can't turn all the cattle into cowboys...
...you'll wind up with too many cowboys.
But he didn't listen.
And now, thanks to his damned raves...
...there are going to be far too many vampires roaming the Earth.
That's where you come in.
Keep the population down to a manageable size.
Plenty of blood to drink.
Everybody's happy.
Precisely.
Which is why I want you to keep on doing what you're already so very good at.
Hunting and killing vampires.
So you want me to be your own personal hemo-sucking hit man, is that it?
Crudely worded...
...but yes, that's the general idea.
And what makes you think...
...that I won't just kill you myself?
Nothing.
Except that you have no real reason.
Think about it, Edgar.
Your brother's already one of us.
Everyone you care about is either dead or playing for my team.
What do you say?
I say...
...why don't you go suck yourself?
Alan, kill your brother. You'll feel better.
Alan, no.
Don't do this.
You're my brother.
You're a Frog Brother.
Don't make me hurt you.
I told you not to make me hurt you.
Last chance, Edgar.
What the fuck?
Fuck you!
You okay?
Yeah.
Fang check.
Hmm.
Death to all vampires?
Maximum body count.
We are awesome monster bashers.
- The meanest.
- The baddest.
That's enough of that.
Hey. I thought you went to the beach with your brother?
I did, actually, but, uh, he wanted to stay out there longer.
He stays out much longer, he's gonna turn into a human piece of beef jerky.
I guess he's making up for lost time.
Yeah.
- Oh, guess what.
I sold your copy of Destroy All Vampires number 125...
...for 500 bucks.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
That's great.
That should keep the bank off my butt for a while.
Now, Zoe, there's something I need to ask you.
How did you know vampires are real?
Just a hunch.
What are you reading?
Oh, I'm actually scanning the book into my Kindle.
I decided, you know...
...I might as well educate myself about all the possibilities of the dark underworld.
For example, did you know that lycanthrope...
...or female werewolves, she-wolves...
...actually can change anytime they want to?
They don't have to do it under a full moon.
That's a myth.
They can turn anytime they want to.
They have complete control.
They can do it in the middle of the day.
Now, that's an interesting theory.
LOVE AND ANARCHY
Mom, what's an anarchist?
Someone that kills kings and throws bombs.
Someone that ends up with a rope around his neck. Now shut up.
Socialism, that's what we need, not anarchy. Or one ends up executed.
We also need the executed!
As long as the world becomes one... for all of us, brothers and sisters, equal and free, like nature made us.
I'm back to kill Mussolini.
Love, love!
Giovinò's is closed.
This is a first-class joint, you know?
We open at 11:00, but there's nothing to do!
Bring me a lot of roses
A lot of them with many thorns
Take care of some rooms.
Hello?
Do you have a hearing problem?
We're closed!
We open at 11:00.
Don't think to insist!
Shit, you're really ugly.
Where in the hell did you come from?
Do you have any money?
You know, it's expensive here.
This is a first-class joint. Do you know how much a fuck costs? 7 lire.
You're scared? What happened?
It disappeared? Get electrocuted?
I'm here!
Odette, where's the clean laundry?
I've been looking for it for over an hour. What a mess!
They never find anything in here.
Oh, dear Saint Rosalie.
If you're in a hurry to fuck, why don't you go to Pellegrino's?
It's cheap there. Actually, why don't you give yourself a nice hand job?
You might get a kick out of it.
Actually, I'm looking for Miss Salomè.
Shit!
I'm a relative.
Where is he? Shit, Zoraide, you idiot!
Why did you wax the stairs?
Everyone is falling down.
Where is he? He's my cousin.
Well, you did grow up, cousin.
You became a hunk, baby.
It's about time you arrived.
Sorry, I can't kiss you with this stuff on my face.
Beauty mask.
Zoraide, isn't he handsome?
How is my aunt? Does she still have problems with varicose veins?
Come on up.
Let's get comfortable and talk.
Zoraide, can you tell Miss Aida
I'm busy this morning?
I have a relative visiting.
Come this way. It's faster.
My room is the mirror room, the best in the house. It's like a fairy tale.
Come on. Follow me.
Come on.
Look. What a beautiful house.
It's the most elegant house in Rome.
Hey, who's that stranger?
Shut up. He's a relative.
Carmela, the lieutenant of the house.
Hello.
Hello, my ass. What about this morning at 11:00? Who's gonna do it?
Let's not mess it up.
Shut up. I'll ask Ivonne.
My cousin has just arrived.
The cousin, the cousin.
He comes here to get it.
Wait. I need to ask a favor of a friend. Ivonne?
No kidding. She's snoring like a train. Ivonne!
Would you shut up, shit!
Oh, I'm sorry, milady, for my loud voice.
Sleep is sacred.
I'm sorry, okay? Introductions:
Miss Jacqueline, my cousin.
What do you want?
Can you take care of my morning shift?
My cousin is visiting.
Let me introduce you:
Ms. Ivonne, my cousin.
- Good morning!
- My pleasure.
Your cousin. So in the meantime,
I get stuck. You owe me.
What are you doing?
Tonino!
Come in. Get comfortable.
Ignore the mess.
Come on, leave him alone.
Look, breakfast is still on the bed.
Come on.
Make yourself at home.
I'm sorry I said you're my cousin, but this way they won't bother us.
Close the door. Those idiots are always walking up and down the hall.
So, you're Soffiantini alias Tonino, right? I'm Salomè!
Pleasure to meet you.
How was the trip? Good?
Come here.
Sit down.
Shit, those idiots haven't prepared my room yet.
I'm really sorry, but sit down.
Oh, sorry. Now, let's enjoy a cup of coffee, okay?
Odette. Two coffees, room nine, please. Quickly.
So the news is confirmed.
Wednesday, July 8th, it's sure!
Tomorrow we're going to the place.
By the way, those windows
I wrote to the guys about?
They are right over the square, just in case you prefer a rifle.
No. I practiced with a handgun.
I don't trust rifles.
Rumba, the longer you touch it, the longer it gets.
Rumba? Please, you don't know what Rumba is.
Leave me alone, whores!
Who do you think you are, huh?
I can get in trouble.
A perennial virgin!
If she's not fucking, she goes insane.
Yeah.
Who'd take her?
Shut up, you rude thing.
I'm not gonna bring you coffee, shame of our land, you whore.
Come in. Come in, Odette.
Finally, the coffee.
My mouth is like a toilet bowl if I don't drink coffee in the morning.
Have you seen Madam Aida?
No, but Donna Carmela has taken charge.
She's downstairs in the hall.
Do I have to tell her anything?
Don't wake up the sleeping dog!
But if she asks... tell her that I have guests and not to bother me.
What are you looking at?
He's my cousin. I'm almost his aunt.
Go. Go. These snoopy ones always think the worst.
And close the door, stupid!
How much sugar?
One or two?
Two, thank you.
So, I think we've said everything there is to say.
You know, the information should be accurate... because most of our clients are very important people.
Military officials.
All the good ones.
Filthy and vain men that like to talk about ceremonies.
You know, they would love to see us at their parades.
You can't imagine how filthy those pigs are.
Well, good luck.
For July 8th?
To July 8th.
Listen. Do you really come from Paris?
Don't tell me if it's a secret.
The less one knows about these things the better.
Well, let's hope we return safely.
I don't know why I'm doing this... because you're all crazy.
In my opinion, I can't stand... these people that are so intelligent yet create such a shitty world.
And you? Isn't it the same for you?
You're still so young... otherwise why would you be doing this?
I... I hate tyrants!
But you... Tell me, Tonino, you're not thinking about tyrants, are you?
You're looking at my legs.
- Oh, fuck. Come on.
- Come on, you're staring at my legs.
It's like you're starving in front of a rotisserie.
I can't keep watching those eyes.
I'm sorry, but have you ever been in a brothel?
Never! When I was serving in Cuneo there were girls under the bridge... but I've never been in a brothel.
Not even in Paris.
I was busy there.
Oh, well.
Why didn't you say something?
You stay there, quiet, quiet like a hungry kiddie.
Come on.
Given our plans, let's just do it.
I'm actually very happy to satisfy someone like you.
You never know, it might even bring me some luck.
Come on, come here.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Don't make a fuss about it!
Don't! If I don't like it, it's the same anyway.
No, I haven't found a place to stay yet.
Maybe later, if it's not too much trouble. Thank you.
Sure. We'll find some time, right?
But tell me, is it okay?
Thank you very much.
By the way, Pensione Margherita is right around the corner.
- I got you a room there.
- Thank you, very kind of you.
Via Manziana, it's the first one on the right after you leave.
If you need anything, don't hesitate.
Thank you.
Thanks for the thought.
Then, Tonino, when you get settled, you can come back to eat.
Thanks!
I'll be waiting for you. Bye.
- Well, maybe...
- What?
Well... Maybe I'll settle in later, unless I'd be an inconvenience?
Sure, I told you.
You need some satisfaction.
Especially here with all these beautiful girls. I know men.
This way it's over with, and you get your head back on track.
Exactly.
Thank you very much!
Come on, come here.
Anteo Zamboni. Ever heard of him?
The attack on Mussolini in Bologna.
You were there?
I was with Anteo.
But we were not involved in it.
Via Rizzoli.
Maybe 5:30 PM.
The procession with Mussolini's car was passing by. He was standing up... among all the black shirts.
Then suddenly a gun shot, loud.
I can still hear it. Then complete confusion. At that moment... the shooter, a guy in his thirties, came like a snake near us... and threw the gun at Anteo's feet shouting, "It's him, it's him!"
"Get him! Get the killer!"
Then he disappeared, that coward!
I'll remember it for the rest of my life. Anteo. Poor guy.
With that haircut and face. So young.
He looked like a baby, 15 years old.
He looked at me. So shocked he couldn't even call for help.
"It's not true!
I didn't shoot anybody! No!"
While those crazy bastards, bastards in black shirts... jumped on him like animals.
I was screaming. They pushed me away.
And that's it.
It was a slaughter.
So bad that at the police station,
Balbo threw up when he saw him!
And someone from Brescia passed out.
That's how bad he was.
And then they constructed a bunch of bullshit that served only to show... there are far more cops than citizens here. And then they literally... crushed the family, you know, really crushed them.
Why? What did they do?
Mammolo Zamboni, the father, and the sister Virginia Tabarroni... were ex-anarchists.
You can imagine.
Thirty years in jail.
Don't even know if they're still alive.
The mother died in a madhouse last year.
But it's better that way.
And me, I was like a fiancée.
And among all that shit, it was like I had leprosy.
So I left.
Oh, shit.
It was hell.
I changed my name, and here I am.
And here I am playing Salomè.
Here, yes, but to prepare everything for you! To prepare this nice July 8th.
You know, I promised myself and Anteo.
I promised those eyes crying for help.
I swore to him, "My love, someone will pay. That bastard has to die!"
Enough now with these stories.
It's useless to talk about it anyway.
Salomè... Oh, shit! I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, may I?
- No, he's my cousin.
- It's an honor.
I'm sorry, it's a pleasure.
I'm Tripolina.
Come on, give him more chicken.
The salad too.
Eat, Tonino, it's good for you.
A big boy like you, used to the country.
You know, I don't like to send a relative to the restaurant.
Madam Aida, thank you.
It was kind of you to invite him over for lunch.
Don't give him so much wine that he gets drunk, fuck!
I said thank you, Madam.
Oh, shit, Madam, this egg is not fresh.
What?
How boring.
My eggs come fresh every day from the country.
Fresh every day? A little chick is going to hatch any moment now!
What is she saying?
She said that a little chick is coming out any moment now.
Nice. Here you have that little chick.
In this house you eat very well.
Oh, sure!
In Florence at Madam Saffo's...
Ms. Valeria got a chef from Paris to please her girls.
A chef from Paris?
Who knows what's behind that?
What's the chef's name,
René, maybe?
Yes, do you know him?
Darling, René isn't there for cooking but for sleeping. Let me tell you.
Forget the kitchen, he's working in Valeria's bed.
She's making him earn the money.
She's not a fool.
In Turin at 13 via Fratelli Calandra, there you really eat like a king!
No, no, Tonino. This is the house where you eat the best.
You're the guest.
What do you think?
Actually... The food seems great, and there's plenty of it.
- Oh, sure. Like in the army!
- How nice, funny girl.
How finicky.
All princesses on a pea.
How ungrateful.
You know, boy... on Sunday I even send them to Faraglia for a sorbet.
You listen to Madam. This is better than Danieli's restaurant in Venice.
Don't make me remember Danieli's.
That was my realm, you know.
Yeah, when you used to wash dishes there, baby.
May you get cancer, fucking bitch!
You get something, idiot...
You know, Tonino, I'm not like them.
I'm an artist.
Do you know what they used to call me at the Salone Margherita?
They called me the Italian Josephine Baker.
Listen, she makes me laugh with that bullshit.
Shut up!
What do you know about my life?
When I had on my silver dress and my ostrich feathers... the royal princes started salivating.
I was a star, Mr. Tonino.
Oh, no. Don't tell me she's gonna start singing?
I still have my voice, you know.
Listen to me.
Idiots!
But since she got syphilis, she's gone insane, that girl.
You're stupid. What do you think?
That we can't sing? Listen now.
- Idiot!
- Stupid!
Fuck you, you know?
They're really shouting, aren't they?
They're giving me a headache.
Ivonne, for crying out loud, you're giving the Baroness a headache.
Baroness Fornigotti, the baroness of the broken asses.
Well, well! Stop it now!
What is this? Where are we?
Well, in a brothel, Madam.
No, baby.
This is not a brothel!
This is a classy house, a mansion.
Understand? Good! If you don't, take your stuff and get out of here!
She's right!
Go tell her.
I don't care, spy!
I'm gonna tell her right now.
Fuck you!
Tell her, come on.
You fucking bitch!
You eat. Don't pay attention to these bitches, eat.
That's where you copied your
Jean-Harlow-of-the-Renaissance haircut.
Stick it up your ass, bitch!
Coffee!
Beautiful, I like it a lot.
Now sing another one.
We have time anyway. Come on.
Don't be difficult, just play.
Miss Salomè, you have a phone call.
Come on, it must be our uncle.
You pig, shut up.
We're on the phone.
I don't know, darling.
Sunday is a time of rest, you know.
What? No, I said rest, stupid!
Listen, stop it. It's all right, as long as you promise to be a good boy.
But I have a cousin here with me.
Yes, poor guy.
He's from the country, and he looks like Alice in Wonderland.
I'm not gonna leave him alone in a whorehouse! I can't!
Well, okay, then I'll bring Tripolina,
Yes, it's okay then.
Shut up, you filthy thing.
Okay, bye-bye.
What can I say? He always brings me
French fragrances, nice!
Shit, I did it.
That was Spatoletti.
Do you know how lucky we are?
Tomorrow we'll go together.
- But who's this Spatoletti?
- Are you kidding?
He's the one that sets up the secret service... to protect Mussolini. I've been after him for three months, that pig.
That son of a bitch was part of the first squads, you know?
Listen. Do you think we're blankets?
Leaving us there under the sun?
There'll be so many people that we won't see shit!
And I'm pissed off because I wanted to see Mussolini.
Calm down, honey.
Spatoletti is here!
I'll find you a first-class spot.
No, I wanna stay close to you.
Or at least one of your secret agents.
You know, if they're secret, a lady nearby can be useful.
But will there be other secret agents?
Yes, 35 of them.
Imagine, 35, all right!
- That's too many!
- Security is all my responsibility!
As long as Spatoletti is there,
Italy can sleep tight.
Damn it, they just have to try, and I'll break them!
Watch out if they touch the Duce!
You're driving like a madman!
Let me out now!
Romoletto, what beautiful girls
I've brought you!
I'm so hungry.
Keep your hands off me. Let's eat.
Come on, sit down.
I'm so hungry, I could eat a cow.
So what's cooking, Romoletto?
Today: Matriciana pasta, eggs fettuccine, chicken.
Matriciana pasta? You've got everything,
Romoletto, good, good.
Who are they? Your daughters?
They're beautiful, nice and firm.
Fortunately, they weren't ready for use in 1922, otherwise...
The whole Tamburini squad, 2,000 of us.
We camped out here for the Rome march.
Do you remember, Romoletto?
Shit! Remember it! Since then they call me "Five and three-eight."
"Five and three-eight," right.
Who was it? Chiusini or Govoni?
We were hungry, you know? And drunk on castle wine. We weren't gentle.
He was late with the chicken. I remember he said, "You need to be patient."
And zap! A knife cut off two of his fingers.
Poor guy.
Did you hear that?
Come on, you must understand us Fascists. We were on the edge.
And that was the revolution, right?
We were making the Italy of Mussolini.
And Romoletto lost two fingers.
You have to feel honored.
It's like you have a medal that big!
Sure. I'm honored!
But there's a little political problem.
If I may, when I do the Roman greeting, they're like horns.
I wouldn't want Mussolini to be offended.
I'm so funny, aren't I?
Oh, fuck.
Did you hear that?
Romoletto?
Salomè, I'm going to jump you.
I will split you open.
You bitch, you do it on purpose because you like me, yes?
My little puppy, isn't it true that I make your mouth water?
Everyone knows that
I love macho men like you.
But then, you filthy villain, who can resist you?
Romoletto!
What are you screaming for, damn it?
Romoletto, hurry up!
I'll throw you in jail, damn it!
Tonino, listen. I'll keep him in the room for a couple of hours, okay?
You're going with that asshole now?
Stupid, he'll explain the ceremony in detail.
In the meantime, check out the square, all right?
- Blondie, are we going?
- Yes, calm down.
And if it's true that you have a soft spot for me, this time I want proof.
Yes, baby. Look.
Honey, if you really liked me, you could do it for free occasionally.
I promised. When my fiancé left me pregnant at 16, I promised.
Not even with the pope.
I'd rather close down business
The exception confirms the rule.
Come on.
No! I told you. Not even free for his sanctity, Pius XI.
Today it's Sunday.
The rate is 12 lire, so?
Bitch! Why won't you give that satisfaction?
- 12 lire or nothing. So?
- So, I'll give the 12 lire!
How generous, for 12 lire.
You could have done it once!
Sure!
With a Tuscany guy like you.
- For love.
- What love?
You cynic.
Enough! You've been destroying my buttocks since this morning.
You love me so much, I can feel it.
I'm gonna do you in the ass right now.
He finally did it. He gave me a headache with that voice. You too?
Yes, madam.
Madam? My name is Tripolina.
Right, Tripoli, land of love.
I was looking for an eccentric name.
Tripolina came out.
Maybe I've always liked Africa, the palms.
Rudolph Valentino doing "The Sheik."
How stupid!
Well, instead you could have called yourself Curly.
Yes.
The country is so beautiful, so green, with fresh air.
Beautiful.
It's very hot today. It's time to go swimming. Do you like the sea?
I've never seen it.
You've never seen the sea?
I've always lived in the country.
That's why you've got such a clean face.
You're a great dancer.
I get by.
What are looking at? Don't look at me like that. You make me sad.
I'm sorry, but I wasn't looking at you.
I was thinking.
You were looking at me, but you didn't see me?
Can't we play something happier?
I don't know, a fox-trot, a one-step?
Miss, if I may,
I'll change the record.
Good, you take care of it.
I'll go back to my boyfriend.
Here you are.
Why did you leave like that?
Are you angry?
Did I do something?
- What? No.
- And so?
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
What happened? Why did you leave me?
Well, I just looked around.
Why? Are you upset?
A little.
I'm sorry.
You didn't get offended, did you?
- Well, yes!
- I'm sorry.
You better be.
Oh, well, it's okay.
You know, there was a guy after me.
Do you know what I told him?
That you were my boyfriend.
Do you mind?
I wish.
Are you kidding?
What a face.
Why are you always so down?
What do you have?
Nothing. It's like that.
Maybe it's spring.
Beautiful cows.
I love the smell of lemons.
Smell.
Do you like it?
Funny, this morning I was thinking it's too bad you're Salomè's cousin.
Why?
You stupid.
We could... do it.
Unfortunately, I can't.
It's something. I don't know, and I can't understand why.
Why, if you're not in the mood, you're not in the mood, that's all.
So, you're telling me that you don't like me.
No, I like you. Too much.
That's why it's better not to.
What no and no?
Yes, damn it.
I'm sorry, may I?
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
If you want, I have a little room.
It's my brother-in-law's.
We don't, well, allow it, but for Sir Spatoletti, if you like.
I'm serious. You're doing me a favor.
I have those two little girls around.
If they came here...
They're two angels.
I wouldn't like...
You understand.
Please, no compliments.
Follow me.
Looks like my parent's home. Look.
Like my mother, always knitting.
Here and there and it's all knitting, and we don't have any socks.
Hey, Curly.
No, don't be stupid.
Don't cry.
Oh, shit, what's happening to me?
Listen, get undressed. Let's make love.
Why all this respect for me?
Did you forget who I am?
I'm Tripolina! What are you waiting for?
Get undressed. Come to bed.
Let's make love, right now, so I can get rid of this craziness!
What's happening to you?
Calm down, okay?
What are you waiting for?
At the whorehouse, they wait in line to come with Tripolina.
Come on, let's make love.
Let's do it, and maybe you'll give me a present later.
Come to bed.
Take off your pants, quick.
Stop looking at me with those eyes.
Get undressed. Let's make love without problems, without staring.
You'll see. You'll like it.
I'm good, quick.
Stop it, damn it.
Stop!
Listen, it doesn't have to be like this.
Everything becomes bad like this.
It could be nice, no?
Don't hurt me.
What? We'll be nice to each other, Curly.
Oh, my God! Did you see your cousin?
He's been screwing for three hours.
Who could imagine it, that loser.
Shut up, you pig!
Tonino is a country boy.
He's never had this kind of fun.
Let him get it out of his system.
Getting it out is one thing, but is he going to do it 12 times?
Who is he? Joe Fuck?
He's a loser! He's a hair head!
He's probably sleeping.
Cousin! Wake up! Put your pants on!
It's late! It's time to go! Move it!
Get your ass down here! Come on!
I'm gonna kick his ass.
It's very late. Zoraide will kill us for waking her up at this hour.
Shut up! You snagged my hose.
Now who's gonna buy me new ones?
Look, don't make me fall.
What's the hurry? If I feel like it,
I might do it again, here on the wall.
A kiss, okay, Blondie?
You know, fucking is good for you.
Are you coming tomorrow? Come after 11, when we're closed. I'll be waiting.
Come on, let's do it right here, right now!
Stop it. I told you I'm tired.
Damn it!
Shit, what a scene.
You're having the altar boy defend you. That ugly face.
You asshole, don't even joke, or I'll kick your ass!
Don't even think of provoking Spatoletti.
What are you doing?
Enough now!
You fucking men.
Let us sleep, fuck!
All right. Heard Zoraide? Stop it.
Come on, Tripoli, let's go sleep.
Come on, don't go.
Stay here with me.
Stop it now! Enough!
You've been pinching my ass all day!
Where do you think you're working?
In a church? This is a whorehouse.
Thank God.
And the ladies are whores.
Enough, shut the hell up! Keep your hands off her. Remember, faggot!
What? You bitch! Call your own son a faggot! Got it? Did you hear that?
That Zoraide.
I've known her for 10 years.
Let's drink.
Nice day. We ate, we drank, we laughed we belched, we fucked and we farted.
And we shat! What more do you want?
A perfect Sunday.
You know what we're gonna do now?
We're gonna wander around.
I think it's late.
Don't be an asshole.
Don't you feel the fresh breeze?
At this hour I still love to wander around and beat somebody.
Like with the squad, when we were hunting the anarchists... and making them drink castor oil.
That was great.
Hello, Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
From up there you can see the light... at the Venice palace. He's there.
He works for everybody, even for you.
Duce, you're the light. It's true.
If I was you, Emperor...
I wouldn't be so calm on that horse.
Some day they could take you down... and put him up there.
What a man. What a man.
Have you ever seen him up close? No?
Then you don't understand shit.
When I see him, I tremble.
He's got a pair of eyes, man... that can even bring the dead back to life.
If you see them, they tell you he can take the whole world if he wants.
I tell you, he's a superior being.
A superman like him is born once in a century.
I tell you, you can't find men with balls like that.
And the rest? Which ones?
The losers, like the people?
The mass, the beggars, little hungry men.
Ready to shit in their pants and sell themselves right on the spot.
They would even sell their sister and their ass for a piece of bread.
That's the people.
The people.
Those socialist pigs were fattening themselves with the people, damn it!
It's the extreme poverty, sir.
You know, courage is for gentlemen.
Me, for example.
I'm from a farming family.
And my mother, the priest and everybody taught me this:
"Better to kneel down and live than stay put and die."
That's it. The morale of the losers.
Well, we can make them have the balls.
And to do that we need to kick them and order them.
And if they won't, beat them, shit!
Give me the bottle.
Oh, sure. But it's dangerous because you can end up like that bartender.
What are talking about?
What are you blabbering about?
In my town, the bartender had a dog.
He was always kicking him, every day.
But the dog always went back to the bartender, licking his hand, to eat.
He was hungry, you know?
And the bartender kept kicking him.
But one day the dog got angry and after the first kick he started to bite.
And then?
You won't believe it, but he never let go, until the bartender was dying... on the street with foam coming out of his mouth.
Well?
What I mean is that maybe one evening a loser, a crazy loser like me.
He's gonna be pissed off.
You come there with your strong hand... and zap! You get stabbed in the stomach. That's an example.
The man hasn't been born that could stab Spatoletti.
You never know in this world.
Really, I'm serious.
With all these poor people, you never know what someone could do.
The stabbing. Maybe one day someone will think about it and you know.
There are so many desperate people.
Desperate people are crazy.
I don't care!
It feels so good here in the arms of the god, Tevere.
You feel like Jupiter, god of Rome.
Nothing is better than Rome, anywhere.
You can see all Rome from up here.
Wickedness, betrayal, scumbags.
How many do you hide? Rome the capital.
7 hills full of shit and snakes, but he only takes care of the little things.
If he would listen to me, opportunists, anarchists, traitors, subversives.
We should have gotten rid of them, even today. I'd just need a sign.
Imagine, it's fun for me.
It's like a party.
I killed more than 100 with these hands, but now we need to calm down.
According to him we need to be politicians. You know what?
I'll probably go wake up Salomè, that beautiful bitch. What a woman.
You know a Fascist doesn't pay women, he takes them.
But with Salomè, it's another story.
You pay her, all right.
Because she's got something special.
So much that there's a line... at the brothel for her.
Because she's a real tramp.
I don't know if you can understand, being her cousin.
While your Tripolina doesn't have any juice. I've been with her... and I know whores very well, and Tripolina, poor little one...
Shit, enough now! You've been bragging all evening! Enough!
- Enough! Or I'll kick your butt!
- Get out of here!
Don't even mention their names!
Got it, asshole?
- All this for Tripolina?
- I'm the loser, not guys like you!
Oh, boy, the baby's in love.
In love!
Watch it!
I'll kick your ass!
I'm gonna kick you in the balls!
I'll kick your ass, bastard!
You're crazy!
Look at this loser!
He's in love with a prostitute, and he takes it out on me.
I'm right, and I feel sorry for you.
You're drunk as hell!
You better leave now, asshole!
If I catch you, I'll throw you in the fountain and sober you up.
Go away!
They're whores!
Are you crazy?
You're still here?
I wanna come in.
My lord, this faggot again.
Do you wanna let us sleep?
Tripoli, my ass.
Will you go away?
Do I have to call the police?
Slam the door in his face, or he'll throw up on the rugs.
Go, go, go! I'll call the police!
Close the door!
Are you leaving?
Think you're smart?
Slam that door!
His foot's in the door.
Take out your foot, asshole.
No, ma'am.
Tripoli!
Is he Salomè's cousin?
Yes, I want in.
Let me in, Madam.
Come in at this hour? Are you crazy?
Go, get out. Close the door, Zoraide.
Go away with your two feet!
Actually with only one!
Shit, right on my big toe!
Fuck, it hurts!
You hurt me!
- I meant to hurt you.
- You old witch!
You can walk so go to bed.
Go to sleep and come back tomorrow to visit Salomè, maybe at lunchtime.
Fucking bitch. You damn witch.
This isn't the way. Hurting people.
Ugly monkey. She broke my foot, and my shoes were already hurting me.
Shit, my toenail is gonna come off.
Go away, you!
Go, stupid! Go away!
What do you want from me?
What? What are you doing?
I'm not a little pussycat, you know.
Hello, kitty.
Hello, stupid!
Where are you going?
Go home.
Why are you following me?
I'm not a pussycat.
And you're young for those things.
You're still here?
Did they kick you out like me?
Are you alone, kitty?
It's dark, isn't it?
Maybe it's because of all these lights... but the night is scarier here than in the country. It's darker.
What are you doing now?
You're comfortable in my arms?
Listen to me.
Go look for a warm corner.
You're better off without me.
Got it?
You're alone, that's it.
Shit, look at this Rome.
Do you have a home, kitty?
I'm gonna take you to my room now.
But listen, you're making a big mistake... because today I'm here, but tomorrow who knows where I'll be?
Boy, you're a sharpshooter.
Where did you learn, in the army?
No, another round, please.
My God, you've been shooting all morning.
This way I free up my mind.
For that you need a girlfriend, not a rifle, believe me.
Right.
Boy, I'll read your hand.
I'll tell you the future. Yes?
No. No, better not, but thanks for the thought.
So do you have a girlfriend or not?
- Yes and no.
- Yeah?
Why aren't you with her if you need to free up your mind?
She's working.
What does she do?
Can I know what she does?
Commerce.
Come on, beauties, we're opening the whorehouse.
Hello, prostitutes!
Ah, do you want some help to get it up, professor?
Fuck you! This jerk is always a pain in the ass!
Go fuck yourself!
Look, professor! What is this?
The morning of flabbiness?
The morning of the faggots?
Let's go to my room!
Let's go. The first fuck is always the best!
Let's go, guys!
Leave me alone! I don't have time to waste! What's your name, honey?
So, what are we going to do, sir?
Are we going or not?
What's this crowd this morning?
The Fascist gathering is going on!
I can't understand why when a military gathering is going on... everyone has to stop by the whorehouse.
Maybe the horns?
See, looks like this morning is going to be a good morning, Madam.
Is there a problem? Introduction maybe?
What are you, gay? Come on...
Why are you all still dressed?
Come on. Go up to the rooms.
God bless you!
Where do you think you are?
In the barracks?
Carmela, don't you recognize me?
What an ass!
It's like a flower today.
Who's gonna deflower me this morning?
Bologna is coming on track number 4.
What a blonde!
What a crowd.
Salomè from Bologna's here.
I've got 15 minutes free.
Any gourmets want to try a new dish?
Shoot. What a pain.
Whoever wants me, follow me.
Oh, well, a man of good taste?
Let's go, let's go.
This morning is not that good, girls.
Tripoli, land of love.
Tripolina's coming.
Hey, you.
Is he deaf?
What a beautiful beard, professor.
Are we going up?
Shoot. Have you seen it? Hall and room.
They might even give us a medal now.
Have you lost your head looking at all these nude women?
What have you done since this morning?
You've got no money.
You're a student. Get out.
Come on, take them up to your rooms, girls.
Tonino, what are you doing here?
Here for breakfast?
No.
Don't tell me you're a client?
For relatives I have a special deal.
I'm all yours, okay?
Obviously after hours.
I've got to go.
Today's a busy day for fucking.
Listen, go for it. I'll give you a half hour you'll never forget.
Today I'm gonna show you my whole repertoire, like in a movie.
Admiral... sailor... faggot.
The cousin.
Are you looking for Salomè?
She's fixing herself up.
She picked a fat turkey, the honorable Pezzotto's son.
She got him in her room.
She screwed him for a half hour.
She can smell a rich one a mile away.
Where's that ship captain...
Bye, Fefè, come again.
I'll treat you nice.
It's hot! Worse than in Catania.
Have you been in Catania? Yes or no?
Bye-bye, and come back to visit me, professor.
Hey! Tripolina's here...
Where are you going, son of a bitch?
I'm paying. I've got the same rights as anyone else. Seven lire, shit.
Quick, this is rush hour.
Today is crowded. Let's move it.
No, Tonino, no.
That's private. No, Tony.
Well, what's this?
I'm sorry.
Look, leave me alone, okay?
What did you do?
What? Leave you alone?
Tonino, wait. Listen, Tonino.
Tonino, open up.
The cousin with Tripolina?
That's funny. He's in love, isn't he?
Hey, Salomè, are you jealous?
Stop being a pain in the ass, or I'll rip your heart out.
Why are you behaving like this?
What's wrong?
I can't watch you do this. You'll have to stay with me a couple of days.
What are you saying?
Two days.
Will you stay two days with me?
Two days, and then?
Then I have to go away.
Don't ask, damn it!
Are you gonna stay with me?
I've lost my mind for you, and I'll do anything, but tell me the truth.
There's nothing to say.
Nothing!
Sure! Do you think I'm stupid?
You've got something.
I've known it since I met you.
Sometimes you're like a crazy man.
Tell me the truth.
Stop it.
I can't tell you anything.
Just tell me if you're staying two days with me or not.
You don't trust me?
I love you.
It's not trust. It's just that the less you know the better.
Oh, well, it's the same anyway.
Do you see this bullet?
This "B" and this "M"?
Look at it, Tripolina.
I'm here to put this bullet in Benito Mussolini's head.
My God!
You're an anarchist?
Now, my love, my life is in your hands.
Wait, wait a moment.
If you wanna get killed by the Fascists then leave now.
I'm going back down to work, to have them abuse me... so I don't think about it anymore.
It was too beautiful.
Get out.
Leave me alone.
This is the worst.
No, no, it's not the worst.
I told it to myself too.
But, Tripoli, listen, many people will never have two days of love.
Don't throw it away like this!
You're the one that wants to.
Why? For politics? Who cares? Why?
Why? Well, because sometimes someone has to say enough.
You feel you have to do it. Anyway I have to do this, and I'll do it.
Understand?
No, I just know that when someone is born unfortunate, she remains so.
Calm down, baby.
Calm down, Curly.
What? A two-day permit in the middle of all this?
Tripolina, you're not a teenager in love. Do you know that?
Then I'm sorry, Madam.
I'll take my two days and go.
You're going? No problem.
But look, if you're gonna do it...
I'll ruin you. You can count on it.
You're off the A-list, I tell you.
And for what? For that farmer with that ugly face? Come on, stupid?
You don't know men. They come, fuck and go away. Come on, go away!
And remember, you're under contract.
These are expensive whims!
I've never got anything from life for free.
I've seen many end up on the sidewalk for love.
It doesn't matter.
Stupid, idiot, jerk.
Still believe in Santa Claus, eh?
Isn't it enough at your age to be a prostitute in this whorehouse?
Madam, the Commendatore is not feeling good. He's white like milk.
I was working, and he had an attack.
He's shaking.
Pull! Put him on the bed.
Get him!
Get him up there!
Shit, he's heavy, poor guy!
Look how pale he is.
Careful, careful.
Put him on the bed, Maurizia! Shit!
Call Zoraide. Not a word to anyone!
To anyone! Not even the girls.
Who's this Giuliana?
Who's she? His wife.
She died not long ago, poor soul.
Otherwise, I'll throw all of you out, okay?
I'll take care of it, Madam.
Shit! The papers. And, honey, continue with the vinegar massage.
But, it's disgusting.
Disgusting? If you'd do your job well, this wouldn't happen.
Poor guy.
He's an old guy who's sick.
What? That's it? Nothing else in the pockets? Are you sure?
Poor guy. Is it true that he lost his wife a year ago?
Yes, she died last year, shit!
A good client. He was always here to spend time with us girls.
He said that the smell of youth made him feel like a new man.
He's frozen.
He's in agony.
We've got to get him out of here.
Isn't it better to ask a big shot?
The police commissioner's nephew, a general. They're all good clients.
Yes, sure. You find one that's willing to expose himself for us.
Come on, Nina! Wake up.
We've got to get rid of him.
He can die anywhere but here.
I don't want dead people around. Go!
Sure, like it's easy, right?
Easy or not, we've got to do it, period.
- I'm here. Madam, did you want me?
- Come here, Zoraide.
Oh, shit, is he dead?
Listen, Zoraide, does your brother still have his carriage around here?
Sure, he leaves it around the corner.
Should I call him?
Call him right away.
He looks better, but it's safer to take him home.
So?
I don't know Rome that well.
Where should I take that guy?
Right around the corner, at the forum.
Nobody's around at this hour, not even the cats. It's all the same to him.
To me, on the other hand...
You're saving me a lot of trouble.
Then, Ninni, if you do me this favor,
I'll give you Tripolina.
Tripolina is a gold mine for us until the day after tomorrow.
With meals, lodging, linen.
Everything free and loving.
And look, I wouldn't do this even for Benito Mussolini.
Listen you! I knew he was crazy, but you? What is this?
You're framing my cousin while I'm working?
Carmela, I ordered maximum discretion.
No, who talked?
I didn't say a word!
Sure, everybody's talking downstairs.
Anyway Tonino can't do these things!
I didn't know you were his manager.
Anyway he's an adult.
And then, if he does me a favor,
I'll do a favor for him.
Sure, bringing him oranges in jail.
There is no need to talk.
My cousin won't do it. It's dangerous.
Come on! The lady says that nobody's around now, not even the cats. Right?
So?
She's saying that! What if a cop catches you carrying a dead man?
What will you say? I said you're not going to do it. It's dangerous!
Enough now, all right? I said I'm going, and that's the end of it. Let's go.
- Wait, Tonino.
- Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
Don't be a pain!
If he goes, I go.
Got it?
Are you crazy? Carmela's going.
What do I tell the guys who want Salomè?
Tell them that Salomè's fallopian tubes shut down.
Hurry, move it.
Hurry. Please, be careful!
What do I do with it?
Come on, hurry.
- Come on. Jump up.
- Let's go.
Watch it!
Go? Let's go.
Stay here and warn us if someone comes.
No, no.
I'm coming with you and Carmela.
He's heavy.
She has varicose veins. Wait here.
I prefer to wait here.
I don't feel well.
Pay attention, come on.
Come on, behind those columns.
It's more private. Hurry up!
Listen to me. If you've got something to say, say it.
Listen, a joke is a joke.
And I like to joke. Life is a bitch.
If you don't laugh at it, better to shoot yourself, and that's it.
But someone like you. With what you have to do. It's different, you know.
I know what to do.
No, you don't! Because I imagined you like a saint, someone without room... for anything except those who suffered and died for the cause.
Why? Don't I suffer?
I don't want to die here.
Yes, but you're risking everything because you fell in love!
So, take Tripolina, go to France and stop thinking of all the rest of it.
Giuliana, forgive me.
Commendatore, calm down.
Don't get excited, Commendatore.
Do you feel better?
There, put him there.
Come on, Commendatore, it's nothing.
It's the hot weather, come on.
You feel better now, right?
He's dead.
Come on, let's go!
Hurry!
How did it go?
Good, nice.
I had a nice sight-seeing tour.
I was so scared.
I'm sorry, but I've got to talk to Salomè. Wait here.
But... Wait, Tonino.
What are you doing here? Go!
Go make love to your Tripolina.
You'll see, after a couple of days of exercise, you'll be shooting like hell.
You won't be able to even pick up your gun. Go! I don't want to talk to you.
Listen, I'll probably die in two days.
I need to stay here.
Who knows what's going to happen now!
I can't stay in that hotel alone anymore. Look how shaky my hand is.
I'm always thinking about it. About that moment, when I'll have to shoot.
And shit, I feel like I'm dying.
I get something here.
I'm scared like hell. That's why
I took care of that poor guy.
To see if I could win it over.
You won, right? And now you're not going to be upset, are you?
Fear is normal. The Fascists are not scared and kill people, but you...
You're an anarchist.
Yes, anarchist. Drop it, okay?
I'm not Michael Sgaravento.
I'm Antonio Soffiantini, and that's it.
What does that mean?
You're a comrade.
Yes, well. I've just recently become involved in this.
I joined after I saw the police shoot
Michael Sgaravento in the back.
Nothing before. Antonio Soffiantini was just a simple farmer. That's it.
One of many.
While him...
Shit, Michael was different!
I'm a joke.
While him, even in that bush, dead, with his mouth full of mud.
He looked like a king.
What's all this bullshit?
Come on, get it out!
Are you one of the Brighenti group or a loner?
I'm nobody, that's it.
I was a friend of Michael's.
Like a brother. When he came back, he confided only in me.
"I'm back to kill Mussolini."
That's exactly what he told me.
He told me everything. He left me the suitcase. He trusted only me.
He told me, "If something happens, take this to the comrades."
As if he knew.
So why are you involved?
I'm involved because I saw him killed like that. I sold the cow...
I got the suitcase,
I took it to Brighenti in Paris... and I told him that I would come here to kill Mussolini.
They taught me how to shoot, and here I am.
Listen, Tonino, have you given it some thought?
Michael, you know, was a dedicated anarchist. He dedicated his life to it.
But you, I mean, maybe at the time you thought of revenge.
But now, if you don't feel like it, you shouldn't do it.
Something like this is a desperate act.
There's no way out.
Do you think
I'll end up like Anteo?
Forget Anteo. If they arrest you, an execution is your destiny.
Or worse, the Saint Antonio.
Saint Antonio?
They'll beat you to death, and no one will know a thing.
What do you want to do? Scare me?
Save it, because I'm so scared... that you can't even imagine.
But I have to do this.
Even if I'm not an anarchist now, maybe they'll make me one later.
Look, I promised myself I wouldn't go back to that slave life.
Day after day, only to die like a dog.
I can't do it anymore.
A farm rat lives better than us.
I promised myself, and this action...
This action is what I need to feel like a man.
Maybe now you don't trust me.
No, it's not about trust.
It's this war we're fighting.
You don't even know why you're doing it.
You're the one to be sacrificed, and you're not involved at all.
Once I've killed Mussolini,
I'll be involved, right?
Yes. Enough now, it'll be okay.
Go with the girl.
She's waiting behind the door like a puppy.
When you look at her, she starts to cry.
Poor Tripoli. Life has already been so bad to her. Go, now.
Good morning. This is really funny.
I knew the cousin lost it for you.
The other night? This jerk almost crushed a bottle on my head.
I didn't break him because I was merciful.
He was drunk as hell, Tripolina.
Who knows? Maybe you found the jerk who's going to marry you.
Best wishes.
Pardon.
These, Tonino, are our passports.
The comrades delivered them.
It's better to cross the border legally as emigrants than illegally.
Because if everything goes well and Mussolini dies... you'll see many problems with those jerks at the border.
Right. If everything goes well, then we'll see.
I'll wake you up at six o'clock.
Everything will be okay. You'll see.
Put this stuff away, now.
Don't make this kitty wait for you.
Isn't love beautiful?
But look where it's going.
I'm sorry, honey, but I've got to sleep, at least a little.
Love, my love.
Hey, girl.
You're always crying, you know?
Come here, don't do this.
You're making it worse.
So, Curly.
It was beautiful, wasn't it?
The two of us alone, like a honeymoon.
Two days only for us.
They're gone. And now?
Now we've got to sleep, and that's all.
And she's crying again...
Listen, Curly,
I want to tell you something.
You're the best thing that's happened in my life.
What are you doing up?
Is he up already? We must wake him.
No, you will not wake him up.
- Are you crazy?
- Come, I need to talk to you.
Don't be stupid.
It's late already.
If you wake him up,
I'm going to report you and him.
Let's go.
Let's talk in the bathroom.
Okay. And now?
Now, you will not wake him.
He's sound asleep... and when he wakes, it must be too late.
Listen, baby, get out of the way.
You were never involved to begin with.
This is not a teenage romance.
Give me the key.
No! I know it's the cause and all the rest. But you're not waking him up!
Because no cause is worth a poor, young guy having to die... like a dog. You know?
Because he will die like a dog.
Of course he will die like a dog.
Like all the others even younger and more innocent than him.
I saw them with my eyes. He knows it too, but it's the same for him... because he'd rather die like a dog than live like a dog.
But only after he does what he has to do. Yes, you die for these things!
All of us are ready to die for this dream!
Get out of the way!
You cannot understand.
And give me the key!
Bastard! No. Watch it because
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!
You're not going to wake him!
I'll kill you!
What do you want to do?
Are you truly crazy?
I'll kill you! Yes, I'll kill you!
And then I'll kill myself.
I don't care to live anymore.
You've got a black heart. You don't care about that poor creature.
He's got that nice cause.
Sure, it's the cause.
Maybe one day it'll happen, and what if it doesn't?
But he's got to die this morning.
If you wake him up... you're killing him!
With those dirty hands! Bastard!
Shut up! Don't scream.
Do you think you're doing him a favor?
It's his decision. When he wakes up, he will hate you, you know?
I know. He won't see me anymore.
He'll leave full of hatred but alive.
- That's enough for me.
- I can't!
That pig has to die.
I promised a guy that died.
He trusted me. I can't listen to you.
I don't want to!
You must listen.
Because you want to wake him for another reason: You're jealous.
Up yours!
You're jealous, and I beg you to help me save him. I know you care about him.
Of course I care about him.
He just fell into this mess... like a bug into a glass.
It's even worse than Anteo.
He's so young that my heart breaks.
I would go if I knew how to shoot.
Too late!
I can't afford these feelings.
Feelings are a luxury, and this is war!
What would happen if all women stopped their soldiers at the door during war?
You die in war. It would be great if every mother did that. Why not?
Why? For history?
For justice?
They've been fighting since the creation of the world.
Explain it to me, all this justice.
The dead stay dead, and that's it.
Damn you. And damn me.
Fucking sentimental whores that we are.
Open up the door. I can't stand this bullshit any longer. Go away.
They're right, never trust a whore.
Why didn't you wake me? Why?
Why, fucking traitor? Traitor!
It's ten o'clock. I'm ruined.
Why didn't you wake me up?
And you, fucking whore, why didn't you call me? Why?
Because right now you'd be dead with a bullet in your chest.
I'm worse than dead now. Like a worm sleeping in the whores' bed.
That's what you are to me, whores!
What am I going to do now?
I'll kill myself. I'll do it.
Where's my gun?
Where is it!
Wait, Tonino, stop!
I'm going to put that bullet in my forehead anyway. Fucking whores. Go!
Stop the crying.
We've got to stop him.
Shut up, Tonino, shut up.
You're gonna ruin everything. Shut up!
Coming... Stop it.
What the hell do you want?
Open up, Salomè.
Now we can't even have a family discussion, damn it.
Fucking bitches. Everybody behind the door like chickens.
Mind your own business!
Got it?
Salomè! This has nothing to do with it.
You know I don't allow confusion here.
What do I care?
It sounded like you were killing each other.
Look who's talking. The other day, this one and the Spanish girl... screamed like hell over a pair of underwear. Get a life!
Oh, shit. They're coming for me.
They're going to arrest me. Arrest me.
Calm down.
Stay calm. Shut up.
What am I going to do now?
They're here for me. You betrayed me.
Stop with this bullshit. Nobody betrayed you. You know it. Calm down.
I can't end up like this. They're coming. I knew it. They betrayed me.
What do I do?
What did you do to me?
Love! I'm sick. I'm scared like hell.
What did you do to me?
Tonino, don't do this. Listen.
Nobody betrayed you, you know it.
We did it only to save you and for love.
I love you two also.
Don't leave me.
Enough, Tonino!
I'm going down to delay them.
You and Tripolina, go out the back.
She's got some money, and you can take mine too. It's in the last drawer.
The gun's there.
You'll make it. You'll see.
Go to Paris, to Saverio Brighenti.
Understand? Saverio Brighenti!
Mother, please don't leave me.
My mother!
Enough. Don't waste time!
And don't be upset with yourself.
Not everyone has to be a hero, damn it!
Come on, Tonino. Here's the money, the passports and the gun.
What are you doing? Come on, honey,
I'll help you. Why do you do this?
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.
We're going to make it.
No, baby, no, calm down.
I'm going to calm down now, you'll see.
No, what do you want to do?
Let's go! Let's get out of here.
No, I'm not going to escape anymore. Go!
Tonino, shut up.
For God's sake, don't go!
It's done. It's the end.
I won't escape anymore.
The medical checkup is on Thursday, Lieutenant.
In any case, the girls are in order.
They're up in their rooms.
You're at home here. If you want to come in, you know the way, right?
Yes, ma'am, I know the way.
Who's that?
Shit, he's armed!
I wanted to kill Mussolini!
Tonino!
Escape, Tonino!
Tonino!
Escape, get away!
Long live anarchy!
Tonino! Bastards, leave him!
Killers!
Stop that car!
I wanted to kill Mussolini for all of you comrades... equal and free like nature created us.
I wanted to kill Mussolini!
Watch it, Tonino! Not like this.
Not like Anteo! Killers! Stop them!
Make him shut up!
Tonino! Tonino!
My love!
Stop, stop. Do something.
He was doing it for you.
For you who are slaves, and don't even know it, you cowards!
He was a poor guy with a big heart.
Better than all of you!
Enough, that's enough.
I'm sorry, Captain. Take him up.
Like this. Here, take this cigarette.
Do you want to talk?
So, sir Soffiantini. Your jail is going to be 30 feet under the sea.
Air comes in through a little pipe.
Little air and no light.
Complete darkness. They lock you up, and you stay there in silence.
Nobody talking to you.
Sooner or later you go crazy.
Pasanante was found eating his own shit.
He became green, flabby, and without hair he looked like a worm.
But, with some names and addresses, we've got mental infirmity.
I give you my word.
Maybe ten years and that's it.
Who sent you?
Are you part of the Brighenti gang?
Say it. Are you with the Brighenti gang?
Are you from Paris?
From America?
Who sent you?
You don't think I'd believe you came to Rome alone to kill Benito Mussolini?
Who sent you?
What'd you say?
I don't know anything about anybody.
Shoot me, it's better that way.
Fucking anarchist! I'll teach you!
Anarchy, shit!
Go, take him away!
Give him a nice treatment.
Tough guy, huh?
Because he's got to talk. He has to.
Hello, Captain Fautasso. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Don't you worry. Bye, sir.
They don't want it known.
He prefers it.
The number of these bastards has tripled lately, huh?
What are telling me, Captain?
The Italians love the Duce.
It's been years since we've heard of any popular unrest.
Then again, instead of killing them like they deserve, he pardons them.
Oh, dear. What are you talking about?
What pardon? Who got a pardon?
The last two, the ones we know, yes.
But what others?
He's a hero, but he's not stupid.
It's better to make some people disappear without publicity.
And this is one more case like that.
It's faster. More political, right?
Damn it!
Go ahead!
This morning at ten o'clock in Via dei Fiori... in the well-known whorehouse... an unknown man... hit by a fit of madness... fired some shots at a police unit... during a routine inspection.
Once arrested the unknown man killed himself... by violently beating his head... against the wall of his cell.
Mother!
I want to repeat my horror at attacks that were not only bad but stupid... because they hurt the cause they were supposed to serve.
But the assassins are also saints and heroes... who will be celebrated once the brutal facts are forgotten... and remembered only for the idea that inspired them... and the martyrdom that rendered them saints.

- Mornin'. Taxi?
- That's right.
- American?
- How d'you figure it out?
Your clothes don't fit proper!
- Maybe you can recommend a tailor.
- Too much responsibility.
Tailoring's personal.
You here on holiday?
Sorte. I'm going to the Witley place.
You're not.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing wrong.
- Can you tell me how to get there?
- No. Sorry, mate.
- I wonder if you could help me.
- Possibly.
I'm anxious to get to the Witley place.
Sorry. I can't help you.
Can you help me?
Excuse me. This man following me.
He's asking for the Witley place.
Here he comes.
Hello. Is there any place around here where I can rent an automobile?
No. Bicycle, maybe.
Where are you going?
- The Witley place.
- You're wasting your time.
- How d'you figure that?
- The Witley place!
He wants to go to the Witley place!
Anything wrong with wanting to go there?
- Is there anything wrong with that?
- Well, is there?
- Bicycle shop's down the street.
- "ls there?" he asks!
- Hello.
- Something you want?
I'd like to rent a bicycle for a few days.
Where would you be riding it?
I'll pay for it in advance.
- I asked where you'd be going.
- To the Witley place.
- I'd need a bicycle, wouldn't l?
- Yes.
And more than that.
You'll not be using one of mine.
Why? You've got loads.
I don't see anybody waiting.
- No bicycles for rent.
- What about the motor?
I've nothing for rent.
What will it cost to get to the Witley place?
More than anything you have to offer.
Why? What's the matter with everybody in this town?
Nothing's the matter. Here.
Just what's that supposed to mean?
It means the only way you can get to the Witley house from here is on your own two feet.
Hello?
Hello?
How do you do? There was no answer so I took the liberty of entering.
The signs clearly say to keep out.
You must have seen them.
Oh, yes. I saw them.
By what right have you entered this house?
- I've come to visit the Witleys.
- Oh? I am Nahum Witley.
Well, sir, actually it's Susan
I came to visit.
Susan? My daughter's not receiving visitors.
I must ask you to leave.
- This the way you treat your guests?
- Guests? Guests are invited.
- I don't remember inviting you.
- Oh, I have been invited.
By Mrs Witley.
"Stephen Reinhart".
You are Stephen Reinhart?
Uh, yeah. That's right.
My daughter did mention your name.
She met you in America at university?
- We were in the same science class.
- Science!
It would disturb Mrs Witley to see you.
Again, I must ask you to leave.
- It isn't her I've come to see.
- Quite impossible.
I will have Merwyn take you to the village.
Steve!
Susan will ask you to stay.
But for reasons I cannot go into,
I must insist you tell her that you have to leave at once. Merwyn!
Get the car.
Steve!
Susan!
- You look great!
- I thought you'd never get here.
- It's only been a month.
- Is that all?
- Father, this is Stephen Reinhart.
- I know.
- I must speak to you alone, Susan.
- I'll take him to meet Mother.
It's forbidden for your mother to have visitors.
Only for a minute.
Mother's been waiting to meet Steve.
I had no idea you lived in a house so, uh... sumptuous.
This is my great-grandfather, Elias Witley.
He built this house over 150 years ago.
This next one?
It's my grandfather, Corbin Witley.
Oh? What did he do?
He went insane.
We must get rid of him, Merwyn.
He must not stay.
Steve, you must understand about Mother. She's not well.
Mother?
Come in and close the door.
Mother, this is Stephen Reinhart.
We have been expecting you.
I'm, uh... I'm sorry you're not feeling well, Mrs Witley.
It will pass.
You are a welcome guest in this house, Mr Reinhart.
- Thank you.
- My husband will protest.
- But I shall speak to him. Susan?
- Yes?
I would like to speak to Stephen alone.
Yes, Mother.
Please, sit down.
I am glad that you have come at this time.
Merwyn!
Merwyn, are you all right?
Yes, sir.
I'm going to need your help.
You can trust me, sir.
- About what, Mrs Witley?
- Come here.
Closer.
That box, Mr Reinhart, there.
Open it.
- It's an earring.
- Yes.
It's an earring.
Take it out of the box. Examine it.
- Looks like gold.
- Yes. It's gold.
But its importance doesn't lie in the metal it is made of.
- I'm afraid I don't understand.
- Why should you?
You probably think this whole house is obsessed with mystery.
I tell you, that single earring you are holding is surrounded by mystery.
It... It belonged to my maid, Helga.
She was a nice simple girl and completely devoted to me.
Well, about a month ago, she went down with some terrible disease.
I begged her to go to the doctor in Arkham.
- Did she go?
- No.
No, I don't think she did.
Chains for devils!
Whatever it was, she seemed to be overcome by... by something, well... Well, it almost seemed like self-loathing.
She took to wearing a veil as if to hide herself from prying eyes.
Why, um...
Why is the earring so important?
About a fortnight ago, she came here to see me.
She was crying.
She said she was... she was frightened of what was happening to her.
- What was happening to her?
- I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Anyway, she left, and she dropped that earring.
Stephen, I haven't seen her since.
Well, perhaps Mr Witley knows.
My husband says he knows nothing.
Stephen, it's because of all these things that I had to be sure of you.
You are my one hope for Susan.
Take her away from here as soon as you can. Tomorrow. The next day.
You must promise me. My husband may not allow me to speak to you again.
I must have your promise now.
- What did you talk about?
- What? Oh! You.
I want you to know,
I have the parental blessing.
Well, half of it, anyway.
- My room's supposed to be down here.
- I'll show you.
This is the room. I'll have Merwyn bring up your case.
Susan, how long has your mother been like that?
Ill, you mean?
Well, that and the uh, darkened room, shaded bed.
Not long.
She's been worse the past few days.
And the doctor's forbidden her to have any visitors?
No, she hasn't seen a doctor.
Father wants to look after her himself.
- And what about Helga?
- Helga?
Why all these questions?
Your mother's very concerned about her.
She's disappeared.
Susan, what's going on here?
I don't know, Steve.
What else did you and Mother talk about?
Come here.
Your mother did ask whether my intentions were honourable.
- Are they, Steve?
- What do you think?
You shouldn't have invited Reinhart here.
You're a difficult woman, Letitia.
No. Not difficult.
Only afraid.
Oh, so that's it, huh?
The sins of the fathers, huh?
Well, let me warn you, nothing is going to deter me from my purpose.
- Yes, that's what Corbin said.
- He's dead, Letitia.
He's been dead for a long time.
If there was evil, it's buried with him.
All that remains of Corbin is a few harmless objects in the cellar.
- No! You know how light pains me!
- Why persist in this delusion?
Please, Nahum, close the curtains. Please.
I wonder if you realise how like Corbin you've become.
There's no similarity whatsoever.
I've uttered no incantations.
Neither have I cried out to any of the other so-called... creatures of evil.
- It's only your methods that differ.
- And do you know why?
Because I don't believe in it.
I never have believed in it.
It is you who would perpetuate these blasphemies, these absurdities.
Nahum, I saw your father change from an upright God-fearing man into an old man possessed of the devil.
Whatever happened to my father will not happen to me.
It's already happening.
I could see it happening to you,
Letitia, not to me.
It's happening to all of us.
There's evidence of it all around us.
There is nothing to do with Corbin Witley.
Corbin was invoking the dark powers when he died.
Now, his call is being answered.
So that is why you sent for Stephen Reinhart.
I sent for him to take Susan away.
- What have you told him?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?
- I don't need to tell him anything.
- He can see for himself.
- I don't want him here.
- One way or another, he must leave.
- He is a guest here, Nahum.
I will not have him interfering.
Would you prefer that I went into the town and showed myself?
The once beautiful Letitia Witley.
Very well.
A day, perhaps, but no more.
Then he must leave.
Well, perhaps by then you will have seen the truth.
The truth?
The truth is that I see the future, and all that I've planned will fill it with a richness we've never known.
Yes, that is what you see.
All that I can see is horror.
Horror!
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a very large room.
Big enough for a king's banquet.
There used to be many parties here in my great-grandfather's time.
- But none since?
- None that I remember.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
Perhaps the name of Witley no longer commands the affection and respect it once did.
Is that why no one in the village would drive me out here?
- You had to walk all that way?
- Mm.
The villagers have no use for us,
Mr Reinhart. The feeling is mutual.
- Merwyn.
- Yes?
Has Mrs Witley had her dinner?
I placed a tray before her, but she didn't want it.
I'll take her up something a little later, Father.
What was that?
Uh, Mr Witley, I um... noticed a strange blackened area on the way to the house.
What happened there?
- There was a fire, Steve.
- A fire?
- Why do you say it like that?
- Well, did you see it?
No, but Father did.
- Why are you so curious?
- Everything is dead in the area.
Nothing grows.
I touched a branch and it fell to ashes.
My daughter had already told you.
There was a fire.
But, Mr Witley, no fire leaves a place like that.
Father's never allowed me to go on the heath.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
After the fire, some villagers disappeared there.
No one's ever explained what happened.
I think, Susan, you're inclined to exaggerate.
I would suggest that you both...
Merwyn!
- What's the matter with him?
- This has happened before.
- But he's unconscious.
- It's perfectly all right.
I know exactly what to do. Susan.
Come on, Steve.
Steve.
Mother? I've brought your dinner.
It's your favourite.
- Take it away.
- You must eat.
Sh.
Quiet, child.
Listen.
- What is it?
- Sh! Quiet.
Yes. Yes!
- Steve!
- What's wrong, honey?
- I saw something outside the window.
- What? Who?
I don't know, but something was staring at me.
Are you sure you weren't imagining it?
- Oh, I don't know. It's this house!
- What about this house, Susan?
There's something in it, something smothering.
- I'm taking you away.
- I wish I could...
- Tonight!
- I can't.
- Why?
- I can't leave Mother how she is.
First she couldn't stand the light.
Now she won't eat.
It was your mother who made me promise to take you away.
- I want to go.
- We're leaving right away.
- It's impossible.
- Tomorrow morning, then.
I'm afraid she won't be any better in the morning.
Oh, Steve. I wish I knew what to do.
- Steve!
- What?
The window!
- Nothing. It's your imagination.
- I'm not imagining it.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.
Now, you have to get some rest.
Oh, Steve. I love you.
And I love you.
Everything's gonna be all right.
It came from downstairs.
- Where does this go?
- It leads to Merwyn's room.
- Father!
- You shouldn't come here.
But the screaming and the noise.
It's Merwyn. He's dead.
It was terrible.
Please go back to your rooms.
Nobody can do anything to help now.
Now, wait a minute.
What's this all about? How did he die?
- He's been ill for a long time.
- Where's the body?
- That's none of your business.
- I think it is my business.
- No, Steve...
- You don't realise what's happened.
This is my house. I ask you to allow me to run my own affairs my own way.
- But a man is dead!
- Steve!
- Get dressed. We're gonna leave now.
- I can't leave now, Steve.
Please don't make trouble.
Good night.
Good night.
- Yes?
- Is the doctor in?
- Did you have an appointment?
- No, but I'd like to speak to him.
- Is it an emergency?
- It's important that I speak to him.
Come inside.
This way.
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Dr Henderson? Steve Reinhart.
I had to talk to you.
Nobody in the village recommended me,
I'm sure.
- I found you in the phone book.
- I've been out of practice for some time.
I didn't come to see you in your professional capacity.
I... Something funny's happening.
The family I'm staying with may be involved.
- Why come to me? Oh, drink?
- No, thanks. It's a little early.
I thought someone objective could help me, give me some information.
- About what?
- About the people I'm staying with.
Why was everyone frightened when I said where I was going?
Frightened? You're talking about the Witley place.
Only "Witley" could bring out that reaction.
- Can you tell me why?
- Sorry, I can't tell you anything.
An old man died out there last night.
I don't give one damn what happened there, neither does this village.
You're scared. You're a doctor, don't you have pride in what you are?
- I may have seen a murder.
- Murder?
- That's right.
- I'm sorry, I can't help. Go away.
You too. What's happened here?
Why is there that fear when "Witley" is mentioned?
Miss Bailey.
Will you show Mr Reinhart to the door?
You asked the doctor about the Witley place.
Can you tell me anything about it, anything about the Witleys?
Only this. Dr Henderson was a good doctor, a wonderful man.
Corbin Witley died in Dr Henderson's arms.
Dr Henderson returned from that visit and he's never been the same.
- What did Corbin Witley die from?
- It's never spoken of.
On the death certificate it said cerebral haemorrhage, but there was no autopsy because there was no funeral, and I'll tell you why.
With the exception of Dr Henderson, no one in the village saw the body.
I've said enough.
I've said more than I ought.
Mother?
Mother, please let me in.
- Susan, dear.
- I heard her moving about.
- Mother, please open this door.
- It's all right. I'll talk to her.
- I've tried to...
- I know, dear. Now, you go along.
I'll talk to her.
Letitia, I must speak to you.
It's very important.
Letitia!
But no one ever goes to the greenhouse at night.
If there was no one inside, why was there a light?
- A light?
- The entire greenhouse... the only word I can think of is glowed.
I've seen a glow like that before, in a radiation lab.
I don't understand. What were you doing outside last night?
- I was watching your father.
- Father?
- What was he doing?
- Burying Merwyn.
- Something else has happened, too.
- What?
I was attacked on the heath.
I'm sure it was Helga.
Oh, Steve.
What's happening?
- Why is the greenhouse locked?
- It never has been before.
- Well, it is now.
- Well, it shouldn't be.
- Have you been in it lately?
- Not since I've been back.
Come on.
Letitia, now listen to me.
It's very important.
I should have done this before.
I'm going to take you to the village, to see the doctor.
Letitia.
How long have these windows been whitewashed?
- They've always been whitewashed.
- There.
- I've never seen that lock before.
- Is there any other way in?
Steve, I don't think we should.
The answer to what's going on may be inside. We've got to get in.
I know a way.
When I was a child, I'd hide from
Merwyn when Mother sent him for me.
I used to get in somewhere here.
Here it is.
- I see it, but I don't believe it.
- How could plants grow like this?
It's fantastic!
Yeah.
How can this happen?
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Remember the cry we heard at dinner last night?
I heard one just like it this morning.
What's in there?
It used to be a potting shed.
Oh, come on, Steve!
It's dark in there, except for a kind of glow.
Oh, Steve! Please come away!
We can't. There's something going on that's affecting all your family.
We shouldn't.
If Father finds out he'll be furious.
Let him. We're not leaving with questions unanswered. Stay here.
No.
- I'm coming with you.
- OK. Come on.
- What is it?
- Those flickering colours.
It must be some kind of energy.
Uranium!
This room is being exposed to some form of radiation.
It's horrible.
It looks like a zoo in hell.
Oh, come on, Steve! Come on!
It's all right!
A menagerie of horrors.
What were they?
Genetic mutations, probably caused by radiation.
It's a scientific fact that exposure to radioactive energy can change characteristics of living things.
It's what happened to these plants, to those creatures.
The scent in here. It's so sweet.
It's sickening.
It's the effect of decay.
- Steve, what is it?
- There's something down here.
This stone's like the ones in the potting shed.
What is it, Steve?
I don't know. I've never seen anything like it before. I wonder if it's an element.
It's giving off heat!
Looks like it's been cut away from some larger stone.
There's one under every plant.
This is the answer. No doubt about it.
- The stones?
- Yeah.
They make everything in here grow this way?
Yeah, and in there, too.
Oh, but Steve!
If it does this to plants...
Exactly, if it affects plants this way after hours and days of exposure, what would it do to a human being?
Mother and Helga.
They worked in here.
Merwyn must have come in contact with these stones, or the larger one from which they were cut!
I wonder where the larger stone could be.
I don't know. In the cellar, perhaps.
- The cellar!
- There are many rooms down there.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Letitia.
Letitia!
That's the door.
- You stay here.
- You won't find the way.
- I will. Now, go upstairs.
- Oh, Steve. Be careful.
Don't worry.
Where's Reinhart?
I've been looking for him.
- What happened? Where have you been?
- The greenhouse.
- I put a lock on.
- I knew another way in.
- You had no right.
- Why have you kept it a secret?
- Was Reinhart with you?
- Yes.
- Is he still there?
- No.
Where is he? Where is he?
- You're hurting me!
- Tell me where he is.
- He's in the cellar.
- The cellar!
- Father!
- Stay there!
Get out of this room.
I said, get out.
No. Not until you listen to what I have to say.
- I'm in no mood for words!
- Would you prefer death?
- Don't threaten me.
- Everything in this house will die.
Get rid of that stone and the smaller ones, or this house will become like the burned-out area, those monstrosities.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- It destroyed Merwyn.
You want it to destroy your wife,
Susan, destroy you?
- No.
- Listen to that humming sound.
Look at the way it glows.
- It's only a stone. It's harmless.
- You don't believe that, Mr Witley.
You know what it can do.
You know Mrs Witley needs a doctor!
Susan. Are you all right?
- Susan!
- Oh, Steve.
What happened?
It's all right. I got you now.
Susan, are you all right?
- What happened to your mother?
- I don't know.
I heard her smashing things.
I tried to get her to come out.
And then the door burst open and I screamed.
I don't remember anything after that.
Can you get up now?
- I think so.
- Come on.
- Are you OK?
- I'll be all right.
I must find Letitia.
- I must help.
- No. Come on.
Letitia!
Letitia!
Come on.
Letitia!
Let's try this way.
Letitia!
Father?
It's only the wind. Come on.
Letitia.
Steve!
No!
Reinhart, get my daughter out of here.
Please take Susan away.
The evil that Corbin created has finally come to root here.
I refused to listen to her entreaties.
Now Letitia's paid with her life for Corbin's blasphemies.
And my own, too.
Mr Witley, blasphemy had nothing to do with it.
In my heart, I must have known that she was right.
It is as she said.
A curse is set upon this house.
How could I have been so blind as not to know that stone was sent from the other side by the hand of Corbin, reaching out from beyond the grave?
- A curse?
- What do you know of this house?
- Or the people who've lived in it?
- The stone was not sent by anyone.
It's easy for you to say that, but you didn't see it that Sunday morning, screaming out of the heavens to crash and bury itself in the heath.
It fell from the sky!
Then it was a meteorite.
I thought it was a gift from Heaven.
The people from the village came to see, but they wouldn't come near it.
They knew because the fear of Corbin was still in them.
The next morning, the heath was covered with a lush vegetation that should never have grown there.
Why did you bring it into the house?
Why?
Because I thought, as Corbin knew I would...
I thought I'd found a way to turn the wasteland into a place of beauty.
Great vineyards, gardens.
That was my dream.
I thought the name of Witley would mean something once again, and Corbin's iniquities would be atoned for.
Everyone he came in contact with was touched by it.
Father, please come back into the house.
Susan! Stephen, will you take Susan away, please?
What about you?
I will stay here to destroy this monstrous thing.
If you go near it, there can only be one result, and you know what it is.
You seem to forget this is my home.
I live here.
And l, like my father and his father before him, was born here.
I'm an old man and if I'm to die,
- I will die here.
- I'm not leaving without you, Father.
Susan, there's nothing we can do.
Let's go.
Something dreadful's going to happen.
Now, please!
Susan, go with Stephen.
Go away! Go away!
Come on. Let's go and pack.
Helga!
That'll do. Come on.
- Father!
- Stay here.
Mr Witley!
Susan! Get back!
Come on.
Get over there. When I say run, head for the door. Go ahead.
No!
Come on!
- Run, Susan! Run!
- Steve!
Susan! Susan! Hold on!
Oh, Steve.
We're going and we're not gonna look back.
I don't understand, Steve.
Why did all this have to happen?
I don't think it had to happen.
In scientific hands, your father's discovery could have been beneficial.
He used it to fight the only way he knew, for his house and the Witley name.
It was his choice and he made it.
Come on, let's get outta here.

Then DANCE ON CHANCE
Once upon a time, seven years ago, to be exact, a young American named Carter
Harrison came to England.
He had been appointed assistant British sales manager of Inter-Allied Petroleum
Products.
It was on his first day in
London, on his very first stroll, that he met Antonia Vincente.
It was a casual meeting.
She was a painter.
She was profusely apologetic, but what was needed was turpentine.
And she knew precisely where to find some.
So she gave the brush to her bearded friend, Harry Jones, and they started out for her studio flat.
Though she came from
Italian parentage,
Toni was basically Bohemian,
British Bohemian.
Her work was Impressionist, and so was she, very impressionist.
No doubt about it,
Toni was a creature of first impressions, a woman of very definite tastes.
She knew what she liked when she saw what she liked.
And she knew what she wanted when she saw what she wanted.
Fortunately, what she liked and wanted was exactly what he liked and wanted, because 24 hours later they were married.
And so the days and weeks went by until their lovely hibernation was over, and it was time to come out into the spring of life and face reality.
And one of the realities
Carter had to face was that Toni was not only a painter, she was also a joiner with very definite beliefs, all of which were the exact opposite of his.
It seemed a joke at first, but suddenly it stopped being funny.
They agreed on nothing, politics, polygamy, peanut butter,
Pushkin, You name it!
They fought their own Battle of
Britain, a battle of words.
And when words failed, she resorted to pure Italian logic.
When logic failed, paint pots flew.
Since her aim was better than her English,
Carter did the only thing a gentleman could do.
He grabbed his pants and ran for his life.
Thus, as their marriage and crockery broke over his head, Carter left.
He left Toni, he left the love nest, he left London.
And for seven peaceful and productive years, they didn't meet or speak or shriek or even write.
Carter had now become an important executive with Inter-Allied, one of their top negotiators, a job which took him to the far corners of the earth.
In other words, the sheik agrees that all oil deposits in this area shall be developed solely by Inter-Allied
Petroleum Products of America?
That is correct.
Good.
Will you please convey to His Highness that these fried grapes are delicious?
Oh. They are not fried grapes.
They're not?
No. They are...
Delicious.
So, his job done, Carter took the first plane to London, where he had an urgent meeting with two very expensive lawyers, because, after seven years of total and blissful separation,
Toni had finally requested a divorce.
In big business, success and divorce do not always mix.
So the company sent
Dick Bramwell, sharpest public relations man in the business, to London.
Bramwell had to move fast, because he knew that in exactly 25 minutes
Carter would be attending a meeting which could very well bring an abrupt end to a very promising career.
What do you mean, no divorce?
Whose brilliant idea is that?
Oh, just a brilliant chap by the name of J.I. Stevens.
The old man?
That's right.
Fancies himself a king maker.
You're being measured for a crown.
Why?
Oh, come on Carter.
You've got to be joshing.
J.I.'s had his tongue hanging out for those leases for years, and you've just handed them to him on a great big spotlighted platter.
Look at this, front pages right down the line.
Yeah, yeah. Look at 'em!
It's promotion time, friend and you're in for something large.
How large? I don't know but it's gonna take top brass approval.
Which shirt shall I wear? Oh come on.
You're not even listening!
This is the biggest thing that's ever happened to you.
Don't you realize Big Daddy's gonna spring this at the annual board meeting next week in Boston?
Yeah?
Yeah.
That's why there's such a hurry for me to get over here and clean up your image.
What's wrong with my image?
You make it sound like I've been named leper of the year.
Well you know the mentality of that board.
They're hipped on the idea of a corporate image, solid American gentry, family respectability.
For their top executives there are not ten commandments, only one.
Thou shalt be married, happily and respectably married.
Whether you like it or not.
That's right.
I've done just fine these past seven years happily and respectably separated!
Yeah. And I've loved every minute of it.
Yeah, well that's all gonna change.
From now on, you're gonna have a new look.
No more gay, married bachelor.
It's got to be Carter
Harrison, family man.
You are out of your skull.
Carter, when that board meets in Boston, you can be Yankee Doodle riding your town on a solid gold pony.
Income in six figures, a private plane, your own yacht, a house in Palm Beach.
It's yours. All you need to do is show up in Boston week after next with one reasonably respectable wife.
Forget it.
Forget what?
What you just said.
Yankee Doodle, solid gold pony, the whole bit. Just plain forget it.
You don't know what kind of a nut I was married to.
No, no I don't.
What kind of a nut was she?
She was a half-Italian fruitcake, that's what she was.
Oh, that doesn't sound too bad.
What was the other half?
Gorgeous.
What did you go around marrying gorgeous fruitcakes for in the first place?
I don't know. It was a cold night.
She had an electric blanket.
It was seven years ago. What took so long getting around to a divorce?
Well, there was no particular rush.
Look Carter, politics makes strange bedfellows.
Why not big business?
Make a deal.
For one month, you stay married.
No chance.
For one month?
No deal. Not with Toni.
Let me tell you something.
She was a crackpot, a bohemian, a hothead.
You know the kind. She used to take a bath in her blue jeans to make sure they'd be tight enough.
Hmph.
She wouldn't consider this sort of deal, and I wouldn't ask her.
Maybe she's changed.
Yeah, she's changed.
From terrible to impossible.
Look, call J.I. Tell him if they want me the way I am, that's fine.
If not, forget it.
He'll turn you down.
That's life.
That's it, then?
That's it.
You know for a fellow who's only going to discuss a divorce with a half-Italian fruitcake in overtight blue jeans, you're looking and smelling awfully pretty.
Evening's young.
Who knows? I might get lucky later.
Yeah.
Excuse me, is this...
Jim.
Carter. Good to see you.
Sorry to rush you over like this, but I don't know anything about British divorce laws.
I got news for you, neither do I.
Mr. Bagshott will see you now.
Buck up. It's no worse than a head-on collision.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Please come in.
Mr. Slade.
Bagshott.
How do you do?
This is my client,
Mrs. Harrison.
How do you do?
Of course, you two, um...
Yes, naturally.
Mrs. Harrison, would you?
Gentlemen?
Before we commence, perhaps I should acquaint you with certain notable points of British divorce law.
While either party may request a divorce, they're not permitted personally to arrange the terms or evidence.
But my client has requested representation.
Even so, I must emphasize that if it's intended to discuss a British divorce, not only is this meeting not taking place, but I am not here.
With regard to jurisdiction, the fundamental rule, with certain exceptions, is that the English courts will only entertain a divorce petition if the husband is domiciled here at the time the petition is filed.
Mrs. Harrison?
Mrs. Harrison?
Carter, is that agreeable to you?
An American divorce, probably in Reno.
Oh, yes. Certainly.
Carter?
Fine.
Mr. Slade, perhaps you and I might talk alone for a moment.
Fine.
Um, you'll hear from me later, my dear. In the meantime you'd best make arrangements to leave for Reno immediately.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Taxi!
Taxi! Taxi!
Oh!
Get in.
Where to, guv?
Where do you live?
32 Chelsea Court Lane.
No, thank you.
You look fine, Toni.
You sound surprised.
It's been a long time.
Yes.
What are you doing with yourself these days?
The usual.
Painting when I can.
Mostly doing fashions for the Daily Echo.
Actually, I've been very successful.
Good.
Would you care for a drink somewhere?
Oh. Well, no. I really...
You know, legally, we probably shouldn't be together like this.
Oh, what could happen in a London taxi?
You should know.
Uh, who's the lucky guy?
Harry Jones.
Harry? Our Harry Jones?
The bearded wonder?
I don't believe it.
I should have married him years ago but for meeting you.
I know. But, seven years?
What's he been doing all this time?
Checking your references?
He was abroad.
Still a crime reporter?
No. Assistant editor now.
Actually, he's my boss.
That's handy.
Do you love him?
Yes, I do.
Good.
That's the way it should be.
With love.
Oh. Better keep him.
I'll walk back.
Do me good.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Um, uh, I, uh...
Uh, what is it?
A studio house?
Mmm-hmm. Uh, you see, it's actually a studio.
I mean, as well as a house.
Oh, that's probably why they call it a studio house.
Probably.
Yeah.
Uh, Toni...
Yes?
Um. I suppose an artist used to live here.
Yes. He was quite famous.
He died.
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
He was 98.
Oh. Well.
Well, I really must go.
Yes, you should. It's cold.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Carter.
Yes?
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Please.
Uh, wait here.
I'll turn on the light.
Make yourself at...
Uh, home.
Would you like to take your...
Coat off?
Do you want a cigarette?
A light?
This is where I live.
It was once a stable.
It's where, uh, they kept horses.
No more empty years.
No, darling.
No divorce?
No divorce.
We must have been out of our minds.
What did we fight about?
Everything.
Everything and nothing.
Never again, huh?
Never, darling.
What about him?
Oh! Harry.
Yeah. Harry.
Well, I don't know.
It's terrible.
I... I hate hurting him.
You couldn't really have been in love with him.
Not the way it is with us.
But Harry's sweet.
Sweet! Ha!
He's nice to have around.
He's big and strong and shaggy.
So is a sheep dog, but you wouldn't marry one.
But, darling, it's time
I had children.
And Harry would make a wonderful father.
If we weren't such idiots, we'd have had children years ago.
We weren't ready.
We are now.
Aren't we?
Real ready.
And he'll be beautiful.
So will she.
It's going to be a big change for you, dear.
From now on it'll be "Carter
Harrison, family man."
It's going to mean diapers and measles and nursery schools.
And nannies.
Does it scare you, darling?
No, no! It's perfect.
Uh, look, dear. I'm due at the office in 20 minutes.
Be an angel and run my bath, will you please?
Certainly, Daddy.
Yeah?
Dick. This is Carter.
Listen.
Everything is gonna be just fine.
Hey, wait. Where are you?
What time is it?
It's 9:00, and I'm in heaven.
Hope you haven't reversed the charges.
You haven't called J.I. yet, have you? No, not yet.
Good. Now listen.
I'm back with Toni.
Aw, you're beautiful!
The old man's gonna be delighted about this.
Just a minute.
What are you doing?
Uh... When a fella's ordering three dozen roses for his best girl, he wants to keep it a secret.
Your robe, milord.
Come here, you.
Oh, darling. Your bath.
Huh.
Better send three dozen roses to the house.
Right. Right. Good.
I'll meet you in the office in an hour. Bye.
Come here, you!
Your tea, sir.
You're insatiable!
Mrs. Carmody, this is my husband.
How do you do, sir?
Hello.
Sir, I'll be off to getting the breakfast.
One egg or two?
He takes four, and the bacon crisp.
Very good, ma'am.
Oh! And, Mrs. Carmody, would you call Mavis Masters for me?
Tell her I can't report today, because it's a very special day, and I don't want to take a chance of getting arrested.
Very good, ma'am.
She's a treasure.
You looked so funny!
Come here, you!
You really are a great big bear.
I must say, she didn't seem very surprised.
Does she usually walk in and find strange men in your bed?
Every morning.
She validates their parking tickets.
I see.
Well, anyway, I think
I like your Mrs...
Did you say "arrested"?
Yes, you big, fuzzy bear.
Arrested.
For what?
Picketing.
Picketing what?
The embassy.
What embassy?
Your embassy.
The American embassy?
Mmm-hmm.
You're picketing the American embassy?
What for?
For ISFAE.
ISFAE?
International Society for
Freedom of Artistic Expression.
You know.
No, I don't know.
Oh, it's growing like mad, darling.
Embraces all the arts.
We are planning a massive protest against the banning of Petracini's statue.
Who?
Petracini!
Petracini! Oh, certainly you've heard of Petracini!
No, but it sounds fattening.
Petracini happens to be the world's leading Expressionist sculptor.
He does wonderful things with a blowtorch.
To whom?
He's a great
Italian artist!
And his work has been banned from
America by petty, provincial minds.
Which petty, provincial minds?
The ones at your National
Gallery in Washington.
If my National Gallery has banned your Mr. Petracini's statue, he must have been pointing that blowtorch in some mighty peculiar directions!
Why was it banned?
They say it's indecent.
That's good enough for me.
It's a simple statue of a woman and a horse.
Doing what?
What's the difference?
Whoever heard of putting fig leaves on horses?
Especially an Impressionist horse!
You wouldn't know where it goes.
Let me get this straight.
You're picketing the
American embassy in London in order to keep fig leaves off of lewd Italian horses in Washington, D.C.?
It's not the fig leaves.
It's the principle!
Ah, yes. The principle!
Yes, the principle!
We artists should be able to paint, write, sculpt anything we like!
Freedom of expression!
Freedom of expression. Yeah, yeah.
Tell me, dear.
Are we still involved with some of our trusty old friends such as "Higher Pay for Women Policemen"?
We are. "Abolition of
Cruel Blood Sports"?
Certainly.
"Rest Home for Gypsies"?
Of course. "Fertility
Control in Backward Nations"?
I'm the co-chairman!
And take that look off your face. Ha.
What look? That smug, disapproving, superior look.
The same ghastly face.
Now, Toni...
Don't you "Now, Toni" me!
I know what you're thinking!
I haven't said a word.
You don't have to.
You're wearing that face.
I'm sorry. It's the only face I have!
And I thought you'd changed!
But, no, you've got the same ostrich mentality you had seven years ago when you were swanking around London with an open car and a closed mind!
And you're still the same half-baked birdbrain you were seven years ago!
Watch it!
Joining every crackpot cause that comes along. Wave the banners!
Yell the slogans.
If you saw six people waiting in line for a bus, you'd join them because you thought they were picketing something!
Oh! Get out!
Thanks. I was just leaving.
Don't let me stop you.
Ah!
You know-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing Knucklehead!
You sneak back into my life like a wolf in snake's clothing!
Crawl back into my bedroom!
Take advantage of my weakness!
Oh! I could kill you!
With what? A slogan?
Oh! Get out!
Grams .
Boor! Go away!
You upset me! Out of this room!
Ugly boor!
Aw, you sound just like your father!
Don't you insult my father!
I didn't insult him.
I said you sounded like him!
That's an insult!
Remember, you said that, not me.
You're not even fit to talk about my father!
Your father was a nut!
Don't you dare!
My father was an artist!
An Italian artist!
An Italian patriot!
You may not realize it, but there are other people in this world beside Italians!
But who needs them?
My father was a martyr to humanity.
Some martyr. He got drunk and fell off a wall.
While making a wonderful speech.
In fluent Italian to a bunch of Cockney garbage collectors!
About as good a group as you'll find for the rubbish you're interested in!
You are the most barbaric, bothersome, boring, bourgeois, b...
Boor?
Boor I ever met!
Morning.
Keep your big nose out of this!
Ah, the same charm, the same sophisticated wit. Oh, butt out.
And getting sharper all the time.
Get out of my house.
When I'm good and ready!
Get out now!
If you want my advice old boy...
I'll thank you to keep your food-stained beard out of my affairs, and my eggs!
Which I might add were slightly overdone. Oh!
I hate to fight and run like this, but I leave happy in the thought that fertility control in backward nations is in such fertile and backward hands!
Oh! Get out!
May I borrow your umbrella?
Yes!
Thank you!
You know I had a growing conviction that his mother was one of those.
Save one for me.
Oh, Harry. I'm so ashamed.
Oh, now, no confessions, please!
It was all arranged,
I was leaving for Reno.
Then he brought me home and...
Oh, Harry.
He stayed all night. I know.
You don't mind?
Of course I mind!
I don't pretend to like it!
But if it's finally got him out of your system...
Oh, it has.
It has.
But what do I do now?
Blow your nose, pack your bags and leave for Reno today.
Tbday?
Today!
All right.
Here.
Oh my, she's done it again.
No, no. I don't anticipate any problems.
Yes...
You can forget what I told you!
What?
It's all off!
She's the same half-brained lunatic she was seven years ago.
Just a moment, please.
What did you say?
I said it's all off!
She's still a fruitcake.
I wouldn't live with her if they made me the next president of the company!
Would you care to tell that to the current president of...
I certainly would!
Please do.
Hello! Who's this?
Oh. Hello, J.I.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Yes, quite rested.
Thank you.
Yes, Bramwell did mention something.
He didn't say which position you had in mind.
What's that?
President of the International
Branch? Me?
Oh, Well
I'm honored.
Well, I only hope I can, sir.
Thank you, J.I., thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Well! That's telling him.
President of the International Branch.
I like the way you turned it down.
Tenth biggest corporation in America.
What about your wife?
200,000 bucks a year.
Your wife.
A 1000 a month expenses, private plane...
Your wife.
My what?
Your wife.
That fruitcake you wouldn't live with if they offered you the presidency.
Oh, yeah. Her.
Yeah, her.
Don't worry about it.
Think I'm gonna let that kook stand in my way?
Dick, how much family image do I really need?
Plenty. When J.I. springs this on the board in Boston you better show up with
Mrs. Respectability herself.
I may have to dope her.
Good!
How much time before Boston?
Ten days.
What!
Yeah, can you do it?
Stand by for communiques.
Oh, soldier. You better put your pants on before the general changes his mind.
Not that you don't have pretty legs but...
Yeah, yeah.
You know, the corporate image?
How much is that?
Four and nine.
Four and nine what? Four and nine.
Four bob and nine pence.
Now don't worry about a thing, darling.
I'll get someone else to cover the Jean Louis show.
I'll call you in New York.
Good-bye, darling.
Put those in a cab, would you?
Yes, sir.
Fourbob. Excuse me, sir.
Comin' through, please.
Not them. The little ones there.
Oh. Oh.
Alright, well, give me one of those paper ones. Do I have any change coming?
Oh, you've been here before, haven't you?
Once or twice.
Bon voyage. And don't lose your nerve.
Those are tanners, those are bobs.
I'd like you to have a bob.
Oh, so sorry.
Not at all. Toni!
Oh, drive on!
Wait!
Listen I'm sorry for all those things
I said this morning. Really I am.
I could bite my tongue off.
Do that!
Toni, I...
Drive on!
Please, l...l love you!
Follow that cab!
Taxi! Air terminal. Fast.
They're gettin' away from us, governor.
I don't think I can catch 'em.
There must be some way
I can reach her.
What about your radio?
Could I talk to her directly?
No, that all goes through central control, mate.
Could I send her a message then?
No, it's too dodgy, guv.
Besides, it's not allowed except in a matter of life and death.
I mean, this is a taxi service you know, not a bleedin' public telephone.
And they're very strict.
That's why the regulations say that that can only be used in a matter of life and death.
Hey, Charley. I got a matter of life and death.
Gent has an urgent message for lady in R-B-4.
Okay, R-B-5. Control to R-B-4.
Stand by for important message for your passenger.
Roger, Control. There's an important message coming through for you, miss.
For me?
Tell her that every word I told her last night was true.
That I am a completely changed man.
Hold on.
Gent says he's a completely changed man.
There's a gent sayin' he's completely changed.
It's a gent sayin' he's undergone some kind of change, madam.
Ha!
And I wasn't lying this morning about having a child.
Now that I find I can have a child, I intend to have a child.
And I don't want to hear that Harry
Jones would make a good father!
All right. Hold it.
Hold it.
Hey, Charley. I got a right one here.
Claims he can have a baby.
Ay, ay! I've read about them in the Sunday papers.
Yeah, but you don't know the half of it!
Seems there's a bloke called Harry
Jones who wants to be the father.
Well the best of luck to old Harry, then.
He'll need it.
Control to R-B-4.
The gent claims he's gonna have a baby, and Harry Jones is the father.
Tell him to drop dead.
Sounds like he might, poor fellow.
R-B-4 to Control.
Lady says she's not interested.
She may not be, but I'm fascinated.
Control to R-B-5.
Right. Lady's not interested, guv.
Tell her she must try to understand my behavior.
I've been under a terrible nervous strain.
First that tricky operation in the Middle East...
Hold it. Hold it.
Get this. Seems our gent's had a nasty operation in the Middle East.
What?
The Middle East!
That explains it then, don't it?
All those fantastic hours in that Arab tent.
Hold it.
Seems as though he spent some fantastic hours in an Arab tent.
Who you got there?
Lawrence of Arabia?
Then flying straight to her arms last night.
And then this morning, that thing with the three of us.
Hold it. Hold it!
I don't think this bloke spent much time watchin' the changing of the guard.
After those fantastic expeflencesinthe Arab tent, he flew back to take up with her last night, and then this morning, some other bird comes into the picture.
Energetic little bleeder, ain't he?
Granted, we don't agree on everything.
But if all nations can practice coexistence, so can we.
Let's face it I'm not in love with the premier of the Soviet Union, but I do want to live with him.
Hold it. Now you're not in love with him, but you do want to live with him.
Right.
Right. Charley.
If I told you who he's after now, you'd never believe it.
Excuse me, madam. Now it seems the gentleman wants to set up house with the Russian prime minister.
They'll make a perfect couple.
Here.
Oh, thanks, guv!
Get out!
What's goin' on here?
Shut up and drive!
I'm her husband. Get out.
Stand by, boys. Hubby's turned up!
His? Or hers?
I was wrong this morning.
I behaved unforgivably.
Oh, what does it matter?
I've come to my senses you can do what you want, join what you want.
Live and let live.
All I know is I love you, and I have to be with you.
It's no good, Carter.
It won't work. It can. It must!
Let me stay with you on any terms you say.
If it doesn't work, I'll bow out and you'll never see me again.
All I ask is for a fair trial.
We both have to learn that there's more to a relationship than just the physical.
We can't keep muddying up the issue with chemistry.
We must try to forget our primeval...
Animal appetites.
Follow that cab and don't lose it!
Shall I help you with the bags?
I'll be fine.
Just hurry back.
♪ Yankee Doodle went to town riding on a pony ♪
Dick? Carter.
First communique.
Unconditional surrender.
Ah. You're still beautiful.
Worked again, huh?
Boston in ten days?
Well, after tonight, no problem.
I'd like to ask you what it is you've got, but I don't want you to waste your strength talking.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Send a wire to J.I. Stevens.
"Harrison reunited with wife.
"Confirms she is perfectly in line with corporate image
"of solid respectability."
Did you ever get that feeling you've been to a place before?
I have this cleared for you.
I hope it will be enough.
Plenty. What about you?
I moved everything to my room.
Oh. Fine.
Your room?
Yes.
I... I'm sleeping in the little guest room.
Why?
Carter, dear,
I've been thinking.
Everything you said in the cab is true.
We... We must find out if we can live together.
And we can't keep muddying up the issue with chemistry and, uh, our primeval animal appetites.
Uh. Oh, I know it will be difficult for us both, but it's only for a month or two.
A month or two?
Oh, it really is a good idea, you know.
Yeah. Marvelous.
Whose is it? I mean...
Of course, it's a fine idea.
I was gonna suggest it myself.
Now, why don't you take this champagne and put it on ice, and then later we'll have a nice, quiet cozy little supper?
Oh, darling, I am sorry. I...
I'm afraid I have to go out.
Our first night?
You know what you said.
"Live and let live."
Unfortunately, there's been an emergency meeting called about the statue.
Signor Petracini's coming, and I've got to interpret.
I won't be late.
Under the circumstances, take your time.
Sorry to rush you together like this, but we've just received information that Friday at 3:00, there's to be an important conference at the Institute of Arts,
Professions and Sciences, the purpose of which is to discuss improving the American image abroad.
Top American figures, and I mean top, from every walk of international life will be attending.
Top American figures from every walk of life will be attending.
Eh.
Eh.
Now what better time could we choose to present our letter of protest against the banning of Signor Petracini's statue?
It is the right time to send a letter of protest against the banning of your statue.
Listen!
How dare they ban my statue, judging it immoral?
How dare the Americans ban his statue on grounds of moral turpitude!
As a man, I am not interested in physical beauty, but only in the beauty of the spirit.
As a man, he's not interested in the pleasures of the flesh, but only the beauty of the spirit.
My works of art come from the soul, not from the flesh.
And he is right!
We artists should be able to paint, write, sculpt anything we like!
Freedom of expression!
Yes, I'm sorry to interrupt.
But I've just been told there is a thick fog and that buses and trains are unlikely to be running much longer.
So I suggest we adjourn the meeting until tomorrow.
There's fog, we have to finish here.
If it's really a pea souper and anyone can't get home, they are welcome to come and spend the night with me.
- What?
- If you can not get home because of the fog, you can spend the night with me.
Me? With you?
Yes. Yes.
Oh, my lady.
Come on. Come in.
Shh!
Oh, baby.
Do you mind?
What are you doin' here?
There's a thick fog.
I had to spend the night somewhere.
There are ten million people in London.
Why choose me?
I didn't. Toni did. She assured me you'd welcome me with open arms.
Yeah. Didn't realize she meant it literally.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Look if you find it intolerable, dear boy, try downstairs!
Why should I freeze?
I'm not complaining.
Well, I'm not...
So here we are, then.
Do you snore?
I hope so!
Oh! You better take an aspirin.
I don't have an aspirin.
They're at the back of the third drawer down.
I nursed her through a bad cold.
Mmm.
Very bad cold.
Sweetheart.
It's me.
He snores.
Let me stay here.
I promise to be good.
I'm terribly sorry!
Out!
Oh!
Psst.Signor.
Where is the lady?
Hmm?
Uh, where is sleeping
Signora Harrison?
Signora Harrison?
Si, Signora Harrison.
Ah!Signora Harrison.
Right there.
Ah.
My mistake!
But what's the problem?
Ooh!
Sorry.
Yes?
Carter?
Yes?
Dick.
Just checking progress.
Can you talk?
Mmm-mmm.
Where are you? In bed?
Mmm-hmm.
Alone?
Mmm-mmm.
Uh, with your wife?
Mmm-mmm.
Not with your wife?
Mmm-mmm.
Does your wife know?
Mmm-hmm.
And she doesn't mind?
Mmm-mmm.
You realize, of course, we can't have this sort of thing in Boston.
Mmm-hmm.
You call me when you can.
My lawyer.
Mmm-hmm.
Where to now, Carter?
Where to what?
I'm sure your recent, splendid exploits in the field of oil will not go unrewarded.
Your masters must have some smashing job in store for you.
Nothing special, I imagine.
Don't you feel just a wee bit concerned about Toni?
Why? Oh, Toni, the marcher.
Toni, the fanatic.
Toni who paints rude slogans on walls!
My dear boy, we live in a free world.
Toni can do what she wants, she can think what she wants.
Picket! Wave banners!
Chain herself to railings!
Her life is her own.
She can ride naked through the streets of London as Lady Godiva, and it wouldn't bother me.
Well, Carter, you certainly have changed.
But you haven't! Look, why don't we out out all this subterfuge? I know your angle.
I wish I knew yours.
What you're doing with this new found phony liberalism!
There's nothing phony about it...
Oh, no?
No.
Care to put it to a test?
Such as?
If you were to attend our committee meeting today,
I very much doubt that you could sit there and listen to the things being said about America without blowing your top!
Would you like to put your money where I imagine your mouth is?
You'll come?
I'd be delighted.
Good 0l' sport!
Uh... You'll...
You'll find some...
Yéah,yeah,yeah.
Ciao! That's my husband.
Oh!
I suggest you take a cold bath.
Terribly sorry. I...
Hello! Haven't seen you before, have we?
No, I just joined.
American, aren't we?
Yes.
Good show!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Last night we were discussing our protest against the shabby treatment meted out to Petracini's
Woman on a Horse.
This morning, a dear and imaginative friend of mine, an extremely broad-minded American, gave me a very provocative idea.
Nine hundred years ago, another woman and another horse made history in a dramatic protest.
Her name was Lady Godiva, and she rode naked through the streets of Coventry.
Now, my friend proposes that Lady Godiva should ride again, through Soho Square and up the steps of the American Institute to deliver our letter of protest against this outrageous attack on the freedom of artistic expression.
Bravo!
Absolutely wizard, what?
Swell.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm sure we shall not lack for a volunteer.
For example, our old friend
Mavis Masters here, a well-known artist who combines good judgment with sturdy attractiveness.
Well, actually I haven't ridden in years.
Oh, what a pity.
But I'm sure there are others who will not shirk this opportunity to further ourcause.
Toni! She'd be fab!
Bravo! Bravo!
Cheers!
So, if Toni would consent to ride?
Nude?
You wouldn't really be starkers, darling.
Just flesh-colored costume with masses of tresses glued all over the important places.
- Sounds painful.
- Do it, Toni. Please.
Well, if it's the wish of the committee, very well.
He just got into a radio cab.
R-H-7-1-4.
Now find out where it's going and call me back immediately.
Carter, come in, come in.
Have I got news for you!
You've got news for me?
I've got news for you.
Wait till you hear who's coming to London!
What do you think she's up to now?
Number one himself, J.I. in person!
She's going to ride a horse...
He's making the opening speech in the conference this weekend.
In the flesh, nude. Stark, staring nude. And where do you think he's gonna make that speech?
3:00 Friday at the American Institute.
What'd you say?
I said 3:00 Friday at the American Institute.
No, that's what I said.
I said J.I. was arriving...
What?
Yes.
He's going to make the opening speech 3:00
Friday at the American Institute. See.
Oh! That's not all he'll be doing.
He just might be taking a little peekie-weekie at my wife.
I hope he will!
Riding a horse? Bare?
Bareback?
Bare everything.
You're kidding?
That's how you ride if you're Lady Godiva and delivering a letter of protest.
And you know when and where you deliver it?
3:00 Friday at the American Institute.
Boy! You really did marry a nut!
A nut? I married a whole plantation.
Yeah, we gotta get her out of town.
Oh? That's all?
How 'bout a vacation?
She'd never leave.
Not with this Godiva thing.
She'd suspect something immediately.
And that's precisely what that bearded vulture's waiting for!
She wears a beard?
No! She doesn't wear a beard!
I have other enemies in this thing.
She wouldn't leave, not without something very strong.
Got a cigarette?
Over there.
Something irresistible.
Something bigger even than...
See this, Dick?
Yeah.
Don't we have oil installation in Gadonga?
We did. They set fire to them last Thursday. Why?
Suppose I were sent to Gadonga.
Look. If you want to commit suicide, use my razor.
It's electric, but you can hang yourself on the cord.
I'm serious!
Why do you want to go to Gadonga?
I don't! But suppose Toni thought I was going to an almost certain death?
I don't get it.
You will.
Gadonga?
Yeah.
Gadonga.
With a brief stopover in sunny Nassau.
You'll like this.
Special recipe of Sheik
Moulay Yusef Allh.
I just can't get over you, cooking and, well, being domestic.
I feel I'm just beginning to know you.
I feel I'm just beginning to know me too.
Just beginning to know what
I really want out of life.
It's all right here in this room.
Tranquility, peace...
And you.
Isn't that the telephone?
Hello. What?
Yes, yes. He is.
Hold on a minute.
It's long distance from America.
Mr. J.I. Stevens.
Isn't he the...
J.I.?
That must be some kind of a joke.
He never calls anyone personally.
Hello. Who is this?
Oh, yes, J.I. Yes.
Well, now, Mr. Harrison.
I have important news for you.
It's rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb.
You want me to go where? When?
Well I realize that, sir, but I'm long overdue for a vacation.
I feel as though
I'm entitled to decline.
Rub-a-dubba, rub-a-dubba, rub-bub-bub.
Washington!
In whose office?
Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dubba, hub-dub-dub.
The Secretary of State!
He wants to talk to me?
Yes, sir.
I'll hold on.
Yes. Hello, Mr. Secretary.
Rub-a-dubba, rub-a-dubba, rub-a-dubba.
The president feels...
Me, sir?
Well, of course,
I can't say no.
Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, ru-- Oh, what a rhubarb!
Naturally, I-l accept.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
And thank you for your confidence.
Good-bye.
What is it, Carter?
It's nothing.
Just forget about it.
What has the Secretary of State to do with you?
And the President?
I don't understand.
It's best you don't.
Where are they sending you, Carter?
What does it matter?
The dreadful thing is
I must leave you just when we've found each other again.
It's Gadonga, isn't it?
WW do you say that'?
I'm not a complete fool! They're sending you on some dangerous mission.
This is strictly classified information!
No one must know.
Damn it! When will this world grow up?
Oh, I'm sorry. I...
I won't let go again.
When, Carter?
When do you go?
Let's get one thing straight.
While I'm still here, we never heard of Gadonga.
We don't mention it.
It doesn't exist.
All right?
Right.
Dinner's ready.
That's not bad.
You haven't touched a thing.
Carter, when are you going?
Now, we promised not to spoil our last night together.
Tomorrow!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't intend to tell you.
The two men before you were slaughtered in cold blood.
I know. Poor devils.
But don't worry, third time's a charm.
And besides, I'll be safe and sound in a nice, big, new, air-conditioned hotel.
The Gadonga Hilton.
Isn't that the doorbell?
Mrs. Harrison?
Yes.
Murchison. Security Division.
U.S. Embassy.
Come in.
Oh, thank you.
I... I have two pieces of equipment here for your husband.
Oh, right over here.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, your husband's bulletproof vest.
Bulletproof?
I'll take that.
Oh, Mr. Harrison. Murchison.
Security. U.S. Embassy.
Your bulletproof vest.
Is this quite necessary to discuss?
The vest? Oh, very. Very.
For example, it's not only bulletproof, it's also completely operational against poison darts.
So long as they're not blown under a range of 20 feet.
Oh, Carter!
Anything else, Mr. Murchison?
Oh, my word, yes. Survival kit.
Keep that very handy.
Thank you. Is that all,
Mr. Murchison?
I shouldn't be impatient,
Mr. Harrison.
After all if your two unfortunate predecessors had paid more attention to their equipment...
Very well. What else? Automatic pistol.
Moeggler-Cartwright.
Kill a man at 20 paces!
Snake at ten.
A snake?
Yes.
Oh, and speaking of shots.
You'll receive your inoculations en route.
Malaria, diphtheria, blackwater fever, leprosy and plague.
Oh, and, uh, finally, your I.R.P.
What?
A last resort pill.
Last resort pill?
Yes, they're marvelous.
Absolutely reliable. Quicker than cyanide and only a teensy bit more painful.
Do I take it with water?
Oh, no! Never touch the water out there. Deadly, deadly.
Well, uh, I guess that's about all, Mr. Harrison,
Except to say it's been an honor meeting a man like you, and I do hope and pray we meet again.
I really do.
It's been an honor meeting you too, ma'am.
Pleasure.
Yes.
I'm happy to tell you that the weather's fine and balmy in Nassau.
Nassau?
Yes, thank you, Mister...
Murchison. Security Division, U.S.
Embassy. Yes.
I'll see Mr. Murchison to the door, dear.
Oh, here!
Nice work, Sir Laurence.
Oh, I really had it tonight, didn't I?
Just a teensy bit overboard.
You got the plane tickets?
Right here.
First class. 11:00 tomorrow for Nassau.
Sure she'll go with you?
I'm sorry, dear. I would have given anything to have spared you that.
What was that about Nassau?
Oh, nothing.
Now, darling.
All right. I may as well tell you.
There's to be a week-long briefing session in Nassau starting tomorrow.
Secretary of State thought that under the circumstances we might want to spend these last...
I mean, these days together, but...
Well, I nearly begged you to come along, but then I thought, wouldn't it be better to make the break now, cleanly?
Call it selfish if you like, but isn't it wiser to keep ourselves at arm's length?
I mean, if we got any closer, it would be unbearable.
Wouldn't it?
Oh, you're a wonderful person, Carter.
All right. Have it your way.
Mr. Bramwell?
Yes.
Good evening. May I come in?
Thank you very much indeed.
Bramwell I'm going to be utterly frank with you.
Should you pick up the phone and call Brigadier Fanshaw at Ml-5 to check up on me, he will unhesitatingly deny that he or anyone else in Military Intelligence has ever heard of me.
Oh?
Sit down.
Uh, would you...
Not on duty, thank you.
Now, officially, this visit has never taken place. Clear?
Yes. Are you sure it's me you want?
I'm not in the government.
And I'm not here, so we start level, right?
Yes.
Thank you, no.
Carter Harrison.
Oh, come now.
British Intelligence isn't quite asleep, you know.
What's an important American business executive doing mixing with our lunatic fringe?
The Anti-American
Brigade, hmm?
Is he? I wouldn't,
I don't know.
Oh, I think you do, Mr. Bramwell and I could hazard a guess myself.
You could?
Yes.
Since Harrison obviously has nothing in common with these people,
I might draw the conclusion that the C.l.A. has slipped him in.
As some sort of a spy.
Oh, no, no, I assure you sir,
Carter Harrison's not a spy.
What's he up to, then?
I have no idea. I'm not his...
I mean after all, it is a free country!
Isn't it?
You know more than you're saying, Bramwell.
Even if I did, I don't talk to every Tom,
Dick and Harry who barges into my room, waving a dirty little card
I can't even read.
Very well if that's your attitude,
I think this is a matter for Ml-12.
Fine! No, wait.
I assure you. There's no question of security involved.
And if it will put your mind at rest,
Carter and his wife are leaving tomorrow morning for a vacation at Nassau.
Tomorrow? Nassau?
With his wife? Yes.
But isn't his wife riding as
Lady Godiva?
Oh, no, no, no! That's all off.
Really? Are you sure?
Oh, positive.
Oh?
Would you? No. Never on duty.
Thank you so much, no.
I see. Well, thank you and good night, Bramwell.
Thank you, uh, Mister...
I don't believe I caught your name.
Yes, that's quite possible.
Good night.
Good night.
No, no! Please! Please don't!
Help! No, please don't.
No!
Have mercy, please!
Please don't do that! Oh!
Oh, no! Oh, no.
Please don't.
Darling!
Help! No!
What is it? Carter!
Oh!
Oh, Toni.
It must have been a nightmare.
There were people chasing me.
With spears.
Blowpipes.
I was alone.
Oh.
In the swamp. Crocodiles.
Tsetse flies.
It's all right.
But I was alone!
Yes, darling,
I know. Lie back.
Poor baby. You're not alone anymore.
But I will be!
No, darling. Never again.
I know Gadonga isn't possible, but anywhere else you go, anytime,
I'll go with you.
Anywhere?
Anywhere.
Even... Nassau?
Even Nassau.
But...
What about Godiva?
They'll have to find a substitute.
Oh, thank you for just being you.
Well, uh,
I suppose...
Yes.
Better go back to your room.
I guess.
Oh, Harry. lwasjust trying to call you.
Is the master at home?
Still asleep.
He had a disturbed night.
Well, before we disturb him again, as disturb him we must,
I have sad tidings.
It seems Mr. Godiva has persuaded Lady
Godiva not to ride this afternoon.
How did you know?
I have my sources.
I happen to know precisely where he's going.
You know!
Yes.
Though I don't know exactly why.
I can't imagine how you found out about the Gadonga mission.
But, Harry, it's absolutely confidential.
Gadonga? Oh, yes.
And it isn't even about oil.
It's the State Department and the U.N.
He's going as a special negotiator to... Gadonga!
Oh, my poor Toni.
He's going to Nassau.
Yes, I know.
You know?
He has to go there first for a few days' briefing.
Ah, and he begged you to come along.
On the contrary, he begged me not to.
But you, of course, insisted, and, graciously, he gave in.
No, Harry. And I resent your insinuations!
This has nothing to do with Lady Godiva.
But it does most conveniently cancel your ride does it not?
You can get someone else.
I thought you had more sense than to fall for a thing like this!
I warn you, Harry...
I warn you that you require my sanction to take time off from the paper.
And if I went without it?
I'd fire you!
Then fire away!
Because I am going with Carter.
And nothing in this world is going to stop me!
Lovely day, sir.
Yes.
I phoned through to the house, and Mr. and
Mrs. Harrison have left for the airport.
Good. Oh, and the airline just telephoned.
J.I.'s plane is due in an hour ahead of time.
Good. It ought to be landing in 45 minutes.
Perfect. I'll run out and meet him.
Have the car... 45 minutes?
Yes, sir.
They'll both be at the airport at the same time! They'll meet!
Who will? Never mind.
Call the car. Get my coat.
What coat, sir?
Any coat!
You haven't got a coat, sir.
Well forget the coat and get the car.
You haven't got a car either sir.
Well do something!
Call somebody.
Are you sure I don't have a coat?
No, sir.
Then forget the coat.
I'll call a cab!
Good morning.
Hi. Oh, hi.
Oh, not now.
Gotta call a cab. Sorry.
Why is Carter Harrison going to Gadonga?
Gadonga? Yes.
Why is Harrison going to Gadonga?
Well, I...
Oh, you don't deny it then?
Yes, I do! It's a lie.
Is it?
Yes. Good!
I'm delighted to hear that.
You see, British and American views on Gadonga haven't always coincided.
My chief was worried the C.l.A. might be using him as some undercover agent.
C.l.A.? No, no.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm terribly sorry. I've got a plane to meet, but there is no truth in it.
Splendid. I know our Prime Minister's calling your President tonight.
Fine. And when he brings the Gadonga matter up...
No, he can't!
He mustn't-- I can't stop him from phoning, but he mustn't bring up that matter. If there's no truth in the story, what harm...
I swear, I swear he's not going anywhere near Gadonga.
I'll need proof of that.
I don't know how you folks found this out, but it's all kind of a joke.
You see Carter Harrison is in line for a top job with this corporation if he can clean up his family image.
That's all there is to it.
His fa... Yes, of course.
Now I understand.
Fascinating old boy.
You tell me more!

Hmm'?
Oh, Carter!
Darling. Oh, now, now, now.
Don't cry.
Everything's gonna be all right.
And I promise you, you have nothing at all to worry about.
Okay?
Absolutely nothing-
I'm sure I speak for...
There he is! Carter!
Over here!
It's... It's J.I.
J.I. Stevens?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
I don't know.
I'm sure I speak for all my friends here, who represent every aspect of American industry, when I say, we consider each
American businessman abroad to be an individual ambassador of goodwill.
He probably has some special instructions from the Secretary of State.
I'll see him alone for a moment.
You better stay here and fix your face before you come over, huh?
Thank you. Excuse us, gentlemen.
We'll see you in the car.
Well, well, well, Carter.
How are you, J.I.? Nice to see you.
Surprised seeing you.
Rather expected Bramwell. You know Ethel.
Yes, Mrs. Stevens.
Hello, Carter.
Is that the young lady we're so hoping to meet?
Yes, um...
Unfortunately, we're just leaving, uh, the country.
Uh, it's...It's my wife's father.
He's... He's desperately ill.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes, they only give him a week.
And, uh, well... Well, it's... It's a sort of a...
Well, he has a kind of a condition.
And it's sort of a double...
Well, it might even be a triple...
Oh, dear.
Yes.
B.E.A. flight 30 for
Paris now boarding at gate five.
B.E.A. flight 3O to Paris...
Oh, there he is!
Bramwell!
Hello.
Hello, J.I. How are you?
Mrs. Stevens.
Richard.
Nice to see you both.
Carter, I see you're here. Yes.
And, uh, everyone else.
Uh, Toni will be here in a minute.
I was just telling J.I. about poor Father.
Poor Father?
Yes.
Oh, poor Father.
Shocking, isn't it?
Oh, shocking.
So, J.I. understands why Toni and I have to leave
London now.
To, uh, bury poor Father.
We hope not.
Latest bulletin has him hanging on by a thread.
Oh, good, good.
I hadn't heard.
Remarkable constitution the man has.
That's where Carter gets it from.
It's not his father, you idiot.
It's hers!
I know, but they were very close.
Oh, Toni. Uh, I'd like you to meet the Stevenses.
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do?
Oh, hello, Mr. Murchi...
Hello. How are you?
Nice seeing you again.
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've been behaving rather foolishly, and...
We quite understand.
No one has a better right, but I'm sure he'll pull through.
You must be brave, my dear.
He's the brave one.
I think they called our plane, dear.
It'll all turn out for the best.
You think so?
With blackwater fever, poison darts and plague!
Oh, dear! He has had a time of it. Hasn't he?
Has had?
Um, now, dear, we promised we weren't gonna mention it again, didn't we?
- Now we really must go...
- Will Mrs. Carter Harrison go to the nearest phone, please.
Mrs. Carter Harrison, please.
It can only be Mrs. Carmody.
You'd better hurry.
Excuse me.
She's a lovely person, Carter.
Thank you, sir.
Bring her to Boston, and I guarantee her you'll have no problems.
Good luck, boy. Good-bye, sir.
Mrs. Stevens.
Carter.
Good-bye.
Did she say "poison darts"?
An explorer, J.I. One of those crazy Italians. Climb anything.
Oh?
Yes.
President of the International Branch?
It seems his firm has a corporate image for its top executives.
They've got to be respectable, happily married men. Get the picture?
Go on.
An Italian explorer, eh?
Yes.
Good, sturdy stock.
Didn't you think so, Mrs. Stevens?
Lovely girl.
Yes.
Mr. Harrison?
Yes.
Oh, I have a message for you, sir.
Yes?
I hope I got it straight.
"Good luck, Mr. Executive.
Sorry I can't make Nassau,
"but have pressing engagement elsewhere.
Signed, Lady Godiva."
Godiva!
"RS. Suggest you take last resort pill now
"with or without water."
Where'd she go?
She left the building, sir.
Follow that cab ahead.
Quickly! Right.
Oh! It's you! Look, I need another favor.
Do you remember me?
Remember you?
Yeah.
How could I forget those fantastic hours in that Arab tent?
Will you try to get a message to the lady in that cab?
Hold it.
Charley, stand by, will ya?
Message?
Tell her I love her. Really love her.
I don't care what she does.
I don't even care if she's gonna strip off her clothes, get up on a horse and ride naked through
Soho Square, I don't care!
Hey, Charley. Tell the boys to get their cameras out, will you?
We're in for a very big day!
Naked? Where?
Soho Square.
Seems there's a gent encouragin'you to strip off in Soho Square, ma'am.
Forget it! Just lose that cab and take me directly to Ryman's Costumes.
I don't know why I was worried about
Carter's wife. She's a charming girl.
Yes, J.I. She'll be a credit to the firm.
Now, Harry. I want the newspapers to know who I am.
Mrs. Carter Harrison.
The wife of...
Don't worry you'll be covered by the press of the world.
If you don't sit still, that's all you will be covered by.
Harry do buzz off.
Mavis, more tresses please.
Yes, Mavis, hurry.
Oh, all right.
But it's rotten of you to come back.
I poured my heart and soul into this.
Had a bit of a job squeezing them in didn't you sweetie?
Oh, charming!
I even borrowed a beautiful black horse blanket from a friend in the guards so I'd be sure to stand out from the horse.
Afact he'd no doubt appreciate.
Oh, wrap up!
Uh-oh! Trouble.
Enter, Mr. Godiva.
Call the police!
Don't worry, we're prepared.
Mavis, hurry up, please!
Come on!
Excuse me.
I want to see my wife. You can see her in Soho Square in exactly 30 minutes.
Are you gonna move or do I have to shove that bush down your throat?
I wouldn't try.
Better move along, sir.
We don't want any trouble now, do we?
Thanks, lads.
Most convincing. Anytime.
How much for the flowers?
Two bob a bunch, sir.
Oh, bobs again! Here.
Keep the change.
Thanks, guv.
Oh, excuse me. Good day, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm sorry to barge in on you this way, but I'm very anxious to see my wife.
Your wife?
Yes, she just came in.
We've had quite a few in today, sir.
Well, this was only
Oh, that would be the dark-haired lady.
Yes, that's the one.
May I see her, please?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but the management does not allow visitors to see clients before they're properly dressed.
I just want to give her these flowers.
Look, I treated her abominably...
We mustn't blame ourselves, sir.
But I do. It was all my fault.
And before I had a chance to explain, she left a note and was gone, just like that.
Oh, that's life, sir, isn't it?
Here one moment, gone the next.
Look, I must see her before she leaves.
But she's not leaving until
Monday, sir.
Are you crazy?
They're putting her on a horse and parading her through
Soho Square in exactly 20 minutes.
Good gracious!
She'll never be ready by then!
A horse?
Yes, a horse.
Oh, is this some sort of, uh, religious thing?
Excuse me. Floral tributes for number six.
Number six? Oh!
These would be for your late lady.
Late?
Late.
Um, l...I'm terribly sorry. I...
I made a dreadful mistake.
I didn't...
Sorry.
Horse?
I love a parade, but this is ridiculous!
Come on. Get in.
You take the truck route.
Rendezvous north side of Soho Square.
Toni! Wait!
Toni!
Wait!
Here! What the ruddy...
Oh!
What d'ya think...
Let gQ!
Toni!
This way!
Oh, may we be of assistance?
Yes, she's hurt.
Needs a doctor.
There's a first-aid center just around the corner.
Thank you.
Wait!
It's much quicker straight through our place.
Thank you.
Just out through the back door and right through the alley and...
Do tell them we sent you.
They've been very kind to us.
Oh, you found your dear lady.
I'm so glad.
It was a car accident.
Oh, a pity. So young!
Such a lot of hair!
Binky, Mavis! Quickly.
You two look up there.
Have a good look!
They're around here somewhere.
Um, I wonder if I could, you know, use your...
Of course sir! That's what we're here for.
Just pop her down there, and I'll nip upstairs and get my tape measure.
Operator. Connect me, please, with a hospital.
Did a lady just run out of here?
Oh, no, sir. Once they're in, they're inclined to stay.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
This is an emergency!
It's my wife! What's that?
No, no, no!
I don't need obstetrics.
I need an... Operator!
Operator!
Yes, yes. Hello.
Yes, obstetrics.
Yes, I don't need you.
My wife doesn't need you either.
Now, listen. Listen carefully.
I need an ambulance.
There's been an automobile accident, and my wife is unconscious and she's lying in a mortuary...
- She's gone!
- Our sympathy, sir.
My wife! Where is she?
Oh, sir! You haven't mislaid her again!
Who's gonna pay for all of this? What's the idea?
We'll never get through. Then get the horse. I'll ride it from here!
Mavis, Binky. You help Toni get the horse out. I'll clear a path.
Excuse me. Come on. Stand back!
Clear a path, please.
Come on everybody.
May I get through, please?
This is Soho, J.I. Quaint place.
Full of quiet charm.
Excuse me.
Hurry up, Binky! For heaven's sake!
Do put a sock in it, Mavis!
Only a minor accident, J.I. The good old bobbies will clear it in a minute.
Oh, Toni!
He's gorgeous! Come on. Come on.
Up you go. Up you go!
Give her a hand.
One, two, three.
UPSY-daisy!
Everybody, would you back up, please? Thank you.
Would you mind backing up, please? We've got to clear a passage! It's very urgent!
Hi, there!
Oh!
Who's that?
Friend of mine.
British Secret Service.
Top level stuff.
This could be the royal family coming through.
You get around, Bramwell.
I like that. Thank you.
Back up, please. Get your cameras ready, men. This may be something exciting.
Queen or no Queen, we're going to be late!
Then we'd better walk.
It's only two blocks.
Right.
We're going to walk.
Pass it on.
Excuse us, please.
We better get back, J.I.
They're turning ugly.
Just saw a man with a bomb!
Nonsense! Come on.
No! Really, I mean it!
They're turning ugly!
Look at that girl.
What a figure!
Disgusting. Shameless.
Better get outta here.
Don't like the looks of that horse.
A trampler if I ever saw one.
Splendid!
Don't you ever think of anything else?
Sorry! Toni!
Toni!
Oh! It's him!
It's him. Let's go!
Don't I know that girl?
No, no, she's a blonde.
I mean, you wouldn't know her.
Phony blonde charging around on a mad horse.
Toni! Get outta here!
Toni, please!
Come along now, gentlemen.
Break it up.
The penalty for striking an officer of the law...
Toni, listen! Toni,
I want to talk...
That's Carter and his wife!
It is?
You rat! Get out of here!
Take your hands...
Oh!
What in the world is she doing here?
I thought her father was dying?
She's gone berserk with sorrow.
Take your hands off me!
Toni! I want to talk to you!
Oh! Let go! Let go!
How dare you!
Toni, please!
"In addition to the accused, whom I now know to be
"Harrison, Harrison, Jones,
Masters and Waring, et al.
"As I approached the accused and reasoned with them,
"asking them to cease and desist forthwith,
"whereupon Harrison aimed a blow at Jones and hit me on the nose.
"Jones aimed a blow at Harrison and hit me on the nose.
"Miss Masters aimed a kick at Harrison, missed him and caught me right in the..."
Perhaps I ought to write this down, Your Worship.
My sympathies, Constable.
Proceed.
"Whereupon Mrs. Harrison aimed a blow at Harrison, knocking off my helmet.
"As I bent down to retrieve it,
"I was put in an extremely unfortunate position as regards the horse,
"which then proceeded to..."
I do think I ought to write this one down, Your Worship.
I think we can dispense with that one altogether.
Will the defendants rise?
In the case of the defendants Jones,
Waring, Miss Masters and Mrs. Harrison, five pounds each.
Mr. Harrison, kindly remain behind.
The rest of you, please see the bailiff.
Don't worry, J.I. He'll come out of this smelling like a rose.
He better!
I understand a lawyer has been retained to speak for you.
Uh, Mr. Martindale.
Are you ready?
Your Worship. I would ask you to consider that a conviction would be a blot not only on Mr. Harrison's unblemished reputation, but also upon the name of the great company which employs him.
Mr. Harrison had no connection with the foolish demonstration planned for Soho Square.
He was on his way, peacefully, to attend an important conference, when he was suddenly shocked to his very roots at the sight of his own wife, indecently clad, on her way to take part in a demonstration designed solely to embarrass the great country of which he is an honorable citizen!
Can you, Your Worship, could anyone condemn a man for rushing forward in a desperate but dare I say noble attempt to stop this woman from committing an act of vulgar folly?
But I trust, I believe you will find Mr. Harrison not guilty.
And this is the truth,
Mr. Harrison?
No, sir. Not a word of it!
I beg your pardon?
None of it is true.
Mr. Harrison, if you feel there's something you ought to tell the court.
I appreciate the efforts of my company to whitewash my name, but they needn't have bothered.
My resignation is already in the mail.
Your Worship. My wife and I have a great many differences of opinion.
As a matter of fact, we disagree on most things.
For example, she believes passionately in the purposes of this committee.
I do not.
But my actions yesterday were in no way an attempt to try and stop her.
I was merely trying to reach her to tell her how ashamed I was of my behavior toward her and that I loved her very much and that being her husband is the only job I care anything about.
After what happened yesterday, you might find this hard to believe.
She does.
But it's the truth.
Thank you, Mr. Harrison.
I hope you get her back.
If that's what you want.
Case dismissed.
Thank you.
You know, that's the lowest trick of all. Sincerity.
Go on! I'll pay your bloody fine.
I'd think twice about accepting that resignation, J.I.
You're losing a great vice president.
And a lousy public relations officer.
Yes.
Well, Julius.
You've just fired your two best men.
I certainly did! A man without principle is a man without integrity, guts or moral fiber.
You certainly stood by your principles!
You bet I did!
When are you going to hire them back?
This afternoon.
Do let's get out of this dreadful law court!
I'm a criminal, darling!
Binky, dear, cheer up!
Oh!
Well, I've blown it. But, anyway,
I appreciate your cooperation.
Even getting yourself arrested!
Your security boys really do a thorough job.
Well, that's what we're here for.
By the way, I never did get your name.
Bond. James Bond.
No relation.
Carter!
Carter, wait!
Home, darling?
Uh, no.
The press will be there.
There'll be reporters and pictures.
Let's find some little hideaway all to ourselves, huh?
Lovely, but, I must get out of this and collect
Mavis's horse blanket.
I left it at Ryman's.
Driver!
Yes, sir?
Take us to... Soho.
We want to get rid of the lady's clothes, pick up a blanket and then find some little place where we won't be bothered by photographers, huh?
Right. Hey, Charley, do me a favor and phone the missus, will you?
Tell her I'll be a bit late tonight.
The passionate Persian is back in town.
I feel washed out at dinner parties.
I could easily doze off.
I work for a big American firm.
I can tell that I've lost my fighting spirit.
HOW I KILLED MY FATHER
I'm worn out.
Your employers sense it too and it shakes your confidence.
Younger men are fighting for your place...
- How are your nights?
- Bad. I sleep poorly.
And then there's all the rest...
Sexually, I mean...
It's not my wife, it's life in general.
I have a son...
He's two now.
I've worked out that when he turns twenty,
I'll be an old man.
In other words,
I'll have no hold over him, no prestige in his eyes.
And so I'm unable to show him any affection.
I look on him... as a stranger.
Almost... as a threat.
That's one aspect of fatherhood.
I'll examine you now but I must explain that the key to your "profile", as we call it, are the lab tests.
They're costly but thorough.
They'll show your body's oxidation rate... the rate you're rusting at, if you like, and ageing.
This is a classic crisis.
We all go through it.
We don't all age equally.
Ready?
Got the champagne?
Don't worry, we've got twelve crates.
Isa!
DeaR SiR,
I RegRet to infoRm you ofyouR fatheR's passing. he died a month ago, unexpectedly, and so could not RetuRn to FRance as he'd intended...
Good evening.
- Wonderful party...
- Yes.
Is our host around?
I haven't seen him yet.
Doctors are always late...
His wife's here.
Where?
That blonde woman.
The elegant one.
Patrick...
- Is there enough?
- Eight more crates.
My friends...
May I have your attention, please?
I'd just like to say that I'm particularly happy to be awarding our town's order of merit, one of our oldest and most cherished traditions, to a man who has distinguished himself as a doctor of talent and innovation.
I won't introduce Jean-Luc Borde since this is his home...
Thank you. Thank you all.
I'm very touched.
I wanted to say that when I moved here, ten years ago now,
I was warned that Versailles was a cold, bourgeois place that would reject any newcomers.
That's what they said.
I looked around and saw otherwise.
I was like an orphan and you adopted me.
If you now feel that I've accomplished something, that's because one must love a place to succeed there.
And with your encouragement,
I shall try to press on and move forward in my field.
But not to make us a pack of breezy centenarians.
After all, we know life is a burden...
Thank you.
Thank you all.
And especially lsa, our hostess.
- How are you?
- Very well.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Yes, it's me...
I simply followed the flow of people when I arrived.
- When did you get here?
- This afternoon.
I should have warned you but I decided to chance it.
The man of the moment...
Feted in your own home?
It's the usual thing here.
I spoke to a few people...
They seem relaxed, not at all mannered.
A little like you were just saying.
A very good speech.
It hit all the right notes.
If this is too much for you, tell me.
No, I don't think so.
I'll make myself scarce.
So soon?
You're such a rarity.
I thought you were dead.
Isa, this is... Maurice.
Are you Jean-Luc's father?
What's more, it shows!
He doesn't look like he ever won the jackpot.
No one makes suits like that now.
What's that cloth?
Terylene...
Right, I'm going.
When d'you need the car tomorrow?
At nine.
You do the glasses,
I'll see to the bottles.
Sorry, he refuses to come.
- I'll ask him.
- No, you mustn't.
Isa tells me your brother works for you. For long?
No, he had trouble at work, so...
Your father could stay here.
In the attic room.
No, I don't want to impose.
Do you think it's a good idea?
Yes, of course...
What about your things?
A small bag at the station.
Patrick can pick it up.
- He can do that.
- I'll go.
I can't say that I know a great deal about you.
He spared you the details.
Thank you.
- You have many paintings.
- You don't like them?
I can't judge. My awareness of art ends with Whistler's Mother.
You must be retired now.
Not quite, actually...
What did you do there?
I had a medical lab, with a pool of African doctors.
It did very well.
I felt I was doing useful work because the country had nothing like it.
But there was a series of violent political events...
That upset things a little.
Perhaps you heard?
I haven't really followed.
It must all seem so far away here.
Third world poverty, bamboo huts...
You realize they kicked him out.
- He didn't say that.
- Of course not.
- He's an old man now.
- He's sharp.
- He's funny.
- Funny?
Original.
Yes, I suppose he must be.
These pills confuse me.
Only the blue one is new.
It's to relax you.
Take one and a half before bed.
You slept better last night.
I woke up once but I read.
Why do you think he's here?
I don't know...
To piss me off.
He wants to make up with you.
I don't buy that.
Why not?
There are times in life when you have to.
Only if you're a father.
Are you angry with him?
No... Not that I'm aware of.
Or I've forgotten.
Last time I saw him,
I was a student in Tours.
He breezed through to say he was happy I'd chosen medicine.
Then nothing more...
The dark continent.
Perfectly well. Yes.
Yes, my bag is here.
Thank you for your welcome.
We met last night.
That's right. You have an appointment with Dr Borde?
No, not at all. I'm his father.
He is expecting you?
- He's very busy...
- I can imagine.
I wanted to see where he works.
Follow me, then.
How many rooms are there?
Ten.
It's a five-star hotel!
All this greenery...
Have you been with Jean-Luc long?
Almost three years.
So he trained you, in a way...
Physiotherapy...
The ladies are there now.
I couldn't harm them.
Where are you from?
- Lebanon?
- No.
Syria?
I studied here but was born in Damascus.
I know it, a wonderful place.
I was a conscript there during the French mandate.
Yes, we gave you a hard time too.
Do you plan to stay here?
I'd like to go back one day...
Yes, it's hard being between two worlds.
Your serotonin rate is still low.
I'll alter the treatment but the results are good.
Do you feel better?
Yes. I still have a few circulation problems.
- You still swim?
- Three times a week at the Ritz.
Good.
You mentioned botox injections.
Yes...
We'll start with the forehead.
We can work on the frown lines and prevent the muscular spasms.
Three or four sessions should do the job.
- You're here?
- I didn't want to bother you.
I've seen it all.
It's magnificent.
Can you see to Mrs Ziegler?
I'll go right away.
You do the tests here?
She said you keep a stock of growth hormones.
Forgive my ignorance but what do you do? lnject them?
I don't see any other way.
And that slows our inevitable decline...
Precisely.
Do you want to try?
No, I don't want to delay the call.
That's good, you have no anxiety or regrets...
This may surprise you but I no longer think of death.
In short, you cover the whole field.
- Do you run it all alone?
- No, I have partners.
It's doing well, almost too well.
Is the waiting-list long?
Fairly, yes.
Well, it isn't an emergency service.
Sure you won't have one?
You're an ascetic.
I'm impressed by your success.
Really?
It's not your style of medicine.
True, it's aimed at one level of society...
The rich need care.
They're human beings too.
Is that cynical enough?
We don't work miracles.
- You're in great shape.
- So-so.
The engine's faltering.
The usual things...
Basically, you're at a loose end.
You're drifting.
In a way. I spent a few days in eastern France.
I have a place there, going to ruin.
I don't remember.
Everyone there is dead or almost.
I soon left again.
I was born there but felt nothing.
- I don't believe in roots.
- You make your own.
It's wherever you end up feeling comfortable.
If you were happy in Africa...
Why am I here?
You said things had been a little hairy lately.
I spent a week in jail with nothing but cornmeal to eat.
Not much fun.
Charged with what?
I didn't kill,
I didn't steal.
As you may know, when those countries blow up, the army moves in, clans change and, even at my level, anything to do with the former regime is swept aside.
They seize your property and money.
You're reduced to nothing, stark naked...
That's life.
How old are you now?
Yes... in a few days.
You have a charming wife.
Very well-bred.
The best side of the bourgeoisie, as I imagine it.
That's an unknown land for me.
But no children?
You don't want any?
Did she say that?
No, good Lord, we've barely met.
I set you a bad example.
- I'll walk back.
- We can give you a lift.
No, don't upset your brother.
I'll walk, it's mild.
Good night.
Still not curious about your begetter?
He's like a plainclothes priest.
In any case,
I'm not a lot like him.
- Had a nice little dinner?
- Interesting.
- You talked?
- He did, mainly.
- Is he after money?
- No.
Does he feel any remorse?
Not his style...
He won't dandle me on his knee now.
But you knew him.
A little...
- The way he treated mum...
- She was no angel.
You're right there...
Let me say this, Solange...
First off,
I think you're a great girl.
I mean it! Everyone says you're too good for me.
The thing is...
I don't know how to tell you this...
I don't want to hurt you...
But... What?
Hold on...
You've met someone?
You're kidding, right?
Who?
The guy from the Sofitel?
The valet parker?
Where?
Senegal?
The old Tarzan spiel. At Club Med?
And you fell for it? It's a trap.
You're by the pool, bored as hell.
Some jerk brings you a drink...
How long has this been going on?
Six months?
What was I going to say?
Nothing, babe.
That I love you, that everything's cool...
Hold on, we can talk.
Solange, give me five minutes!
Give me one more chance.
Okay, then, get lost!
Piss off! Bitch!
Max, can I have my bottle?
Look who's here.
My brother, the doctor.
Evening, doctor.
Well, what did you think?
It's not bad...
- Did you write it?
- Yes, all on my own.
- Did you laugh?
- Yes.
When did you laugh?
I can't remember exactly but...
There's a "but". Tell me.
I need input,
I'm still working on it.
It seems pretty good to me.
The humour is...
But it went down well.
You never give anything away...
- I like your hair.
- Yeah?
Laetitia, Jean-Luc, my brother...
- Want a drink?
- Malibu.
Max, give us a Malibu.
She's not bad. I can set you up.
I have to be going.
God, you're so uptight!
I don't believe it...
Don't piss me off.
I came here for your sake.
- What time is it?
- Two.
I'd given up waiting for you.
I have a pain in my chest.
Want something to drink?
Here, have some water.
Hello, Maria.
Come in.
Everything okay?
I'm like a pig in clover.
The coffee's delicious.
Don't worry, I'm not going to move in for good.
Stay a day or two.
- Are you off to work?
- I'm late...
- Did you sleep here?
- Yes.
Here, I've brought you a tie.
Very smart...
I'm too scruffy for you?
No, but if you go out...
I know you haven't mentioned anything but I assume you're hard up.
It's none of my business how you ended up like this...
You have a pension?
You didn't contribute?
I was careless.
You're broke?
So, you expect me to...
What?
Help you out.
After all, why not?
I can give you a decent monthly allowance.
I don't feel obliged, not at all, but it seems natural since I can afford it.
There, I've said it.
Think about it.
I heard you.
Thank you.
Why didn't you speak to Dufour?
- He disgusts me.
- He's a lawyer.
So let him plead...
Can't you see them for lunch?
- You drank too much.
- Two glasses. I was bored.
- I bet I won't sleep...
- You've already decided...
I'm sorry.
Men find you so attractive...
That Swiss guy was staring at you.
Which one?
The young, good-looking one with the longish hair.
Yes, perhaps...
Funny, some guys have sex written all over their faces.
I wasn't bored.
Good. You talked a lot.
That's true,
I tried to keep it lively.
Is that him?
At this time of night?
Surely he wasn't with a hooker?
I think that if I'd met him by chance
I'd have fallen for his charm.
There, you see.
But have you seen his eyes?
When he's silent, they're pure ice.
He judges you calmly, down to the bone.
Isa...
Are you ill?
No, but I'm very hot...
It's stifling here.
I'll get up now.
Have you taken something?
A drop of scotch...
I mixed it with a sleeping pill.
- What pill?
- I don't know.
A green one, a capsule.
That feels good.
Thank you.
Your pyjamas are funny.
Should I call Jean-Luc?
No, he'd be furious.
I'll stay here a little longer.
Does this happen often?
Often, no...
Don't mix things... you don't know where it may lead.
Yes, doctor.
- Do you feel better?
- Yes.
Take my hand.
Your hand is cool.
FoR a fling with you, theRe's nothing I wouldn't do
FoR a fling with you
I pRomise I won't be late ifyou fix me a date
FoR a fling with you
FoR a quick spin
As dawn peeks in,
BefoRe the night has fled
FoR a quick spin
As dawn peeks in, nestled in youR bed
I'd give it all away, neveR mind what people say foR a fling with you
I could damn myselflike this, foR a single stolen kiss...
You've missed so many of his birthdays.
I'm making up for lost time.
This was Patrick's idea.
I've never seen Jean-Luc like this.
Are you listening?
See that guy...
The old guy on his own, by the toilet door...
That's my father.
What's he doing here?
I didn't invite him.
- How old were you when he left?
- Search me.
Four.
- I think he's pretty classy.
- Yeah...
He looks better with that tie.
You're acting as if I'm making demands.
You're not but I'm tied up until September.
I may be gone by then.
What do you mean?
Great song. I didn't know it.
You and your brother get on well.
Why wouldn't we?
I'm glad you can let yourself go occasionally.
Yes, it happens every ten years or so.
I'm not an adventurer like you.
My father's the last colonial doctor.
Want a drink?
Yes, vodka.
- I butted in.
- Not at all.
It's amusing to see you together.
We don't know how to talk.
We advance, retreat, avoid each other...
Oh yes, we talk about money.
We're both clumsy.
Don't take it badly but I'm stunned by your success.
As a child, he was a bundle of nerves, a bit dyslexic...
- He had long bouts of inertia...
- What a memory!
And have these fits of rage.
Our parents see us as kids.
That's their problem.
Everyone changes.
You're above all human emotions now.
But I remember a man who stood up at dinner and said
"l'm going to blow my brains out."
That's true.
It did happen once.
Okay?
You're new. D'you live around here?
No.
Coming with me?
Strange, all these pictures...
You like them? I did them.
- Where did you learn?
- At my gran's.
She had a little perfume shop.
I used to help her out.
I'd see the women's faces and felt like drawing them.
I picked up a pencil to pass the time.
People liked them so I kept it up.
Colours are important for me, see.
Reds, ochres, blues...
Blue, a little like your eyes.
I want to kiss you.
I need to stop at that shop.
I'll only be five minutes.
You wonder why we're here.
A little.
She insisted.
You get on well.
Yes, she's very kind to me.
She has her good side.
Poor little rich girl...
I can't justify myself to you.
There are things you don't know and that I won't explain.
We don't know each other.
What did you do before?
Nothing much use.
That's why I'm here.
I've done a bit of acting.
You have the looks...
I worked on markets, flogging US army surplus.
- That sells well.
- Sort of.
I got screwed but it was my fault.
So Jean-Luc took you on...
It's not killing me. It's cushy.
I come and go, I park... I wait...
Is your brother kind to you?
He's kind, yes...
He's made a big success of his life but...
It hasn't made him human.
It'd be wrong to criticise him.
I was a Catholic as a child, a scout, very pious...
I wept on the day of my first communion.
From 20 to 24, I was a Communist, at the end of the war.
Then I seemed to lose every form of ideal in my life...
But I'm not saying
I have no beliefs.
Hello, lsa.
Hello, Cyril.
My father-in-law.
Maurice Borde...
We'll be in touch. You look great.
He has very impressive hair.
Almost leonine.
Is he one of your suitors?
No, he's sweet but a bit of an idiot.
I have no suitors.
- Never?
- No.
Well, just once, but I ran a mile...
I suppose I'm the faithful type.
If the feeling's shared...
I don't know and I don't want to know.
That girl you saw, his assistant... there was something.
Something very banal but I'm sure it's over.
We know each other by heart.
I know what he's about to say.
He's so different from the people I knew.
And intelligent too.
That's true.
I know I've been lucky.
He certainly has been.
Even if I'm sorry we have no children.
It's a choice...
No, I really wanted children.
More than anything.
I think Jean-Luc feels the same but it's dangerous for me, so...
Were you advised not to?
Jean-Luc's been my only doctor for years.
Sometimes, a second opinion can help.
I feel so jealous at times, in the street, in parks, when I see all those blissfully pregnant women or others with strollers...
I don't like feeling that way.
Myriem... You're not there?
You must be out with your son.
It's Sunday.
I'm upstaiRs.
I have to go andjoin the otheRs.
My paRents-in-law aRe an ad foR sixty-yeaR-olds.
They'Re not my patients, maybe that's why.
My bRotheR with his cuRRent "paRtneR". he's doing some gReat dives into the pool.
And my fatheR...
Yes, he's still in occupation. he's stuck heRe like glue. he's smiling and Relaxed, chatting to my wife and bRotheR.
It looks so idyllic.
It's all a pathetic sham.
- Okay?
- Fine.
- You're not swimming?
- No.
I don't like my body.
You're pretty slim.
You were chubby as a child.
I was downright fat.
You wouldn't do any sports.
Patrick!
Let me take a photo of you three.
It's more peaceful here.
Playing happy families soon tires me.
You agree it's meaningless.
Are you being evasive or do you think I'm a fool?
Don't you have the perfect reply?
I'm listening.
You haven't responded to my offer.
I thought you'd given me a few days.
Perhaps you felt insulted.
I'm sorry.
What does a stranger expect?
I thought you didn't want to talk about it.
It suits you to think that.
Probably.
But, deep down, it is interesting.
How do you cancel it all out in one go?
You become someone else.
That's ambitious.
I thought my life was mapped out, in a long, straight line.
Times were different then.
Then it all came to a halt overnight.
I'd finished with the day's patients.
It was a Thursday.
I went into St Antoine's Church.
The organist was playing.
The one you liked.
Remember him?
Vaguely. His daughter wore braces.
I went to a bar, I had a drink...
An aperitif...
And I stayed there for at least an hour.
I felt incapable of going home.
The last train to Paris was leaving and I took it.
I went to a small hotel near Denfert-Rochereau.
There was a travel agency nearby with catalogues to go anywhere...
Asia, Africa... New countries waiting to be developed.
I could have gone anywhere.
I couldn't resist.
I had to leave.
It was a matter of survival.
What was so unbearable?
Not other people.
It wasn't your mother.
She was beyond reproach.
But I was a changed man.
I no longer recognized myself.
You mean no one was stopping you.
Oh, I thought about returning.
But the idea of standing before you...
I'd never have found the words.
I was caught up in another system.
There's no changing it now.
Does it work?
Do you end up forgetting?
The trouble is, you do.
On the highest bRanch,
A nightingale sings
Sing, nightingale, sing
You whose heaRt is so light...
I have loved you foR so long
I'll neveR foRget you.
His father came through with a present.
About time...
Wait, there's some wine.
I love the way you said,
"There's some wine."
Really?
As if nothing else existed.
That must be where the truth lies.
I've heard about an apartment we could visit.
If you like.
What have you done with your father?
I don't follow his every move.
He's had a depressing life.
He's touched you.
He's a case.
He's like you, I suppose.
Make the most of it while he's here.
You'll regret it when it's too late.
I think my strongest memory with dad...
It's odd saying "dad"...
I feel like I'm speaking Russian.
If I said "popov", it would mean as much to me.
I think my strongest memory with "popov" was the day he forgot me at the supermarket checkout.
I spent the afternoon with Teddy.
Teddy had been forgotten too.
When his mum fetched him, she kept saying, "Naughty mummy."
And Teddy just kept wagging his tail and licking her face.
Dad didn't fetch me. No.
He had a business meeting that lasted ten years.
It was on the 200th floor.
The lift broke down,
Dad was trapped up there in the clouds.
He could only pee or call my brother who kept me posted.
My brother has a direct link to dad, see.
Since he was born, they've had at least three weeks together.
A lifetime compared to my twelve hours...
Well, twelve... counting the six spent waiting at the supermarket, of course!
- Drink?
- No thanks.
I've finished.
They thought I was a customer.
I must look the part.
- Do you come here often?
- Yes.
You're beautiful like that, without make-up.
I don't know what time it is.
We can walk a little longer.
You're expected at home...
I don't think so.
I want to stay with you.
You have nothing to say?
It's very cruel of you.
You're together?
Where were you? At your thing?
- Yes.
- Until this late?
The meeting ran on and on.
I'm going up.
Good-night, Maurice.
There was a call for you.
From Africa.
Jean-Toussaint something...
Ah, yes... I'll call him back.
Who is he?
A friend, a doctor.
A remarkable fellow.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You seem remote.
Why tonight, not yesterday or tomorrow or in three weeks?
What do you mean?
We don't have to do it for the sake of it.
What's got into you?
It's what I feel. I'm not angry.
I'd rather you were.
You think so?
You're miles away.
No, I promise I'm not.
If you know better, tell me.
I don't know anything.
I'm trying to understand.
Perhaps you're hiding things.
What would I be hiding?
We had it because you decided.
It seemed unreal to me.
Don't make a fuss about it.
What are you up to with him?
I enjoy talking with him.
About what? What can he tell you?
That he won a Nobel Prize?
That's a stupid thing to say.
Are you flirting with him?
You turn him on?
- You're not choosy.
- You're insane.
Can't you sleep?
You can't either.
I want a glass of water.
I have some here.
Did you have women out in the bush?
I wasn't a monk.
Professionals mainly.
Right. Whores are handy.
No strings attached.
As you say.
Never more than that?
My head may have spun occasionally but the union of two bodies, the fiery ecstasy of love...
I've never known it.
Put my mind at ease...
It's not hereditary, is it?
No, who said it was?
- No one.
- Look at Patrick...
You can tell he's hot-blooded...
But it's no crime to be of a more placid disposition.
It's just a small part of ourselves.
An appendage.
We're not even sure it belongs to us.
- I'm exaggerating.
- No, it's true.
The truth is, 90% of the time, we fuck alone.
Your view's darker than mine.
Maybe...
But you're past all that now.
Old age must be a relief.
Once, I remember, he turned up dressed all in blue.
And I politely led him to the electricity meter.
Later, I learned to read the signs, of course.
My brother helped me.
"A man in a cap is the postman, a fat man's the neighbour,
"if he's selling calendars, slam the door on his fingers."
My brother's got flair.
Always one step ahead.
At three, he was top of the class, at five he was dissecting frogs...
What marked me most of all was that at the meter, dad smiled at me.
I felt comfortable and I said,
"Mum told me where the gas meter is but I forget now."
Looking back,
I think that's the longest sentence
I ever said to him.
Come in.
He threw a fit last night.
We got back too late.
So?
What is he thinking of?
You told him it was nonsense?
I've thought about what you said.
I'm looking for my test results.
Would you check them?
If you like.
- I wondered if you were up.
- That colour suits you.
Thank you.
Don't let me disturb you.
Come in, we've nothing to hide.
I've been on this treatment a year.
I expected better results.
With your background, the results are good for a man of your age.
You told me to walk.
Well, it exhausts me.
You expect to gambol like a lamb?
You can't dance the night away.
What's wrong with you?
How many to go?
Four more appointments.
All this could end overnight.
Just a minute.
Can you undress?
Don't gawp at me.
I only asked you to undress.
I'd like to see you naked.
You have a beautiful body.
Solange... Give me five minutes.
Okay, go ahead, get lost!
Piss off! Bitch!
There you are...
I was telling Laetitia I enjoyed it.
Really? I'm not too useless?
It's lively, it's funny...
It's full of truth.
It doesn't seem your style.
Why?
Because you seem a bit... a bit old-fashioned.
You see the type of career
I could have had.
Care for a drink?
Can you get us two glasses of champagne, honey?
She seems very fond of you.
I'm about to screw up...
She wants to pull out all the stops, white wedding, the works...
Bravo.
She has a friend setting up a video business down south.
I'm thinking about it. I don't know if I can do that to Jean-Luc.
Does he need you?
He's a crap driver.
He has his wife, his chauffeur, his handmaiden...
Everyone has a part to play.
Hats off to him. His pills and hormones are a gold-mine.
You're pretty scathing...
You know, the years soon pass.
Don't get bogged down in messy situations.
If you have a real opportunity, don't hesitate.
Take it.
This is Jean-Toussaint Diallo.
I took the liberty of inviting him round.
He's spending a few days in Paris.
He's here to contact relief organizations.
It won't be easy.
We're not always welcome.
They tend to be generous.
It's fashionable, fortunately.
- Did you meet there?
- I've known him since he was 16!
Your father was my mentor.
He changed my life. He persuaded my parents to let me study.
He encouraged me, he was always there.
- Where did you study?
- Montpellier and Czechoslovakia.
I know you're a doctor but what's your field?
Gerontology.
An ugly word but Europe is old.
We miss Maurice.
He's very popular, everyone knows him.
I hope he'll come back soon.
You knew he was coming?
He had mentioned it.
He said things are much quieter there now.
That's good.
People are even going back.
You mean you want to?
I didn't expect to but it's possible.
I'd get the lab back, with a new team.
They just need you?
No, of course not... We'll have to get things running again.
- Just as you left it?
- Not quite.
No strings attached?
A few debts to settle.
How much?
I can't say exactly. At the most...
500,000 francs.
That's quite a sum...
That's for sure.
Hi.
- Give us five minutes.
- What time's your...
Please!
It would be a loan, all signed and official...
I can draw up a repayment schedule.
- Three years at the most.
- You're joking.
I couldn't possibly accept otherwise.
What's the link with Diallo?
He turns up just after you...
There's no link.
He has nothing to gain.
He's just an intermediary.
You were undesirable but you can go back if you pay!
You... I mean, if I pay!
What's to say they won't rob you and throw you back in jail?
You're mistaken. I have guarantees.
Diallo is...
I know, a "remarkable fellow".
He loves you like a son.
How touching.
But I don't see why I should trust him!
Why?
Because he's African?
Please, don't give me that...
Sorry...
I was being absurd.
It's not the money.
I could get it for you.
But why go back to those warlords, civil wars and the heat?
You want to fall ill so I can fetch you?
You can't start anew at 75.
It's irresponsible and immoral!
You follow nature's cycles.
You step down, you tend to your roses!
I don't have any roses.
Fleeing's a mania with you.
What do you want to do?
Take the last train?
Go back into exile like an eccentric?
With that same clean conscience?
Who'll fall for that?
It's chronic abandonment.
Can't anyone rely on you?
Such as who?
Nobody needs me here.
All right then... if you feel as free as a bird...
But I won't help you like this.
I won't drag you down deeper.
True, we don't know each other.
I've seen you for... two minutes in the car... fifteen at the cabaret... a bit longer at the pool.
But at the pool... the others were there too.
I wasn't alone.
What more can I tell you?
I've done things all these years...
I've drunk...
I've eaten...
I've slept...
Inevitably, I've slept.
Maybe I've only slept?
Can we go?
- It ran on and on.
- No sweat.
Had a wild old time?
Shit...
- What now?
- What d'you suggest?
Didn't you see him?
He was in the middle of the road!
Try driving slower...
Nice work.
So change it!
At 55,000 miles, it's junk.
- You've been drinking.
- Yes, I have!
Look, we're all okay...
- I thought you could drive!
- No, I can't even do that!
You want to fire me? Go ahead.
Do me a favour!
- We'll talk when you sober up.
- Fuck!
I wait for hours at your fucking fundraiser!
- Calm down.
- It's your job.
Don't.
I'd belt you but you can't fight back.
It had to end like this.
He'll forget by tomorrow.
A Renault Dauphine.
We had one when I was little.
What do you think?
It's big, it's nice and quiet...
Why do you want me to live here?
It's better for you and your son.
I'm fine where I am.
I won't have you keeping me.
I was mistaken.
You won't change, Jean-Luc.
It's our last day then?
Are you sure?
Where will you go?
I'll land up somewhere.
I'll let you know.
I looked carefully at your test results.
It's not my speciality.
As I said before, you should get a second opinion.
But, quite frankly,
I see nothing to stop you from having a child.
I don't understand.
Mistakes can happen.
How could he be that wrong?
- Fear...
- Fear of what?
I won't sing the praises of fatherhood.
But there are many ways of avoiding it.
That's a horrible thing to say!
What's all this? Hot air?
A hoax that you flog?
You have to be a pretty bad doctor.
A charlatan.
- Who did you see?
- A specialist.
That's all? Nothing to say?
I say you're useless and you don't react?
We did try.
I stopped us from going further.
- I don't understand.
- It was to protect us.
What do you mean?
Deep down, I couldn't...
It was like a threat...
Explain.
I think it scared me, physically.
Looking after a child, raising it...
Worrying, punishing...
I'm not suited for that.
- You should have said.
- You'd have left.
You don't know!
Well, I thought so.
Because I need you.
That's cheap talk!
How else can I say it?
You call that love?
What you've done is worse than lying.
You've robbed me. Mutilated me!
Don't touch me!
You shrivelled, little man!
Your words are empty and hollow.
What are we? Business partners?
A sort of showcase?
There I was, a dumb bitch, greeting, opening doors, smiling, arranging flowers...
All that's nothing. It's empty!
To hell with it.
Have you eaten?
Did you raise your funds?
I have a few promises.
That's good.
I was just going.
I'll see you out.
You're still hanging around?
I was waiting for you.
I have to pay you to get rid of you?
Run, run, go after him!
So, you have some scruples?
Idiot.
Off to pack your knapsack and sneak away?
You can't fuck her so you get your kicks another way?
- She'll be back.
- She said so?
You're all she has.
Why do this to me?
- I wasn't thinking of you.
- You never have.
Why would l?
Because it's natural?
I'm not obliged to love you.
It's hell being your son.
You've ruined everything since you conceived me... with your ice-cold cum.
How can you look at yourself?
Aren't you ashamed you're not dead?
How dare you, you prick!
Jean-Luc...
Open the door...
Open it...
Please...
Please, let me in.
Listen to me...
My whole life has slipped away... without me grasping anything.
I haven't touched things.
I've learned nothing.
I don't want you to end up like me.
Forget me.
I didn't make you, you made yourself.
And you'll carry on doing it.
That's all you need to know.
It's up to you.
Let me in.
Don't turn me away.
Open the door.
Don't leave me in this hole.
What can I possibly say?
What's between us will always be there.
Alive or dead.
Is that why you came?
Who knows why we do things?
You look like you did when we went to Spain in the Dauphine...
You'd lost your wallet, with all your documents, all your money...
We were at the roadside... and you kept saying,
"We're done for...
We're done for..."
I was there... and I didn't know what to do.

If anyone does not know this place:
It is the Kingdom of Ling, the centre of the world.
If anyone does not know me:
I am Ma Nene Karmo.
I live in the blue turquoise palace in the divine paradise.
You appeared in this world where there is so much sorrow and hate.
The people hunt the animals.
They kill and eat them.
The people catch the fish with iron hooks.
When you destroyyour enemies, the gods and Padmasambhava take them to the Kingdom of Heaven.
I, Ma Nene Karmo, always feel compassion for living creatures and never hate for them.
Brahma also always feels compassion for living creatures and never hate for them.
You have to subjugate the 1 8 kingdoms ofthe demons and all their other domains
Collect the treasures for Ling and spread the teachings of Buddha.
You must go to the underworld.
When you get there, beware of the boar-headed and the dog-headed spirits.
Furthermore, you will also find the cold hell and the hot hell there.
There, too, is a bottomless river.
Onlyyou and your horse can cross this river.
Midshung, Drugmo and Pekar Lhatse are personifications of the goddess Tara.
They appear in the world to save the living creatures.
I, Ma Nene Karmo, work in the upperworld of the gods, in the middle world of Ngen, in the lower world of the water spirits.
I work forthem all and do not remain idle.
You, too, must be active.
Do not stay here long.
Go to the underworld to save the living creatures.
You must pass judgement on what is good and what is bad.
Follow the white light and go to the underworld.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
In this way Ma Nene Karmo sang about the work of Drugmo in theworld, about King Gesar's descent into hell and about his horse.
From the victorious golden throne
King Gesar, the heavenly ruler, the earth's tree of life, looked upon the assembly with loving and watchful eyes.
All the fathers and mothers, sons and daughters of Ling offered their adoration and good wishes to the King.
Theyjoyfully sang old songs and performed propitious dances.
They drank tea and barley beer in a festive mood.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
Is the 24th a Friday?.
It is a Friday!.
All right then.
On that daywe bring burnt offerings.
Yes, burnt offerings and prayers.
Margen, is Monday your neutral day?.
Yes.
Is Monday a good day?.
Yes, it is a lucky as well as a neutral day.
Then let's set out on Monday!.
It's the right time ifit's a neutral day.
A neutral day is good!
Yes, it is.
Leave on Monday and celebrate the preparation feast on Friday?.
Yes, dear, that's what we'll do.
Friday is Margen's most favourable day.
And the element water is available twice over.
It is an excellent day for the preparation.
Yes, my dear.
Let us also play equestrian games, so that all the lucky signs agree.
Zopon's horse will have to show what it can do.
That remains to be seen!
Kiang or these two horses will win!
Kiang must do his best; ifhe loses, he's lost his chance!
Ifhe loses, he is finished.
But we are betting on him.
...Nextyear at this same time, maywe all bejoyfully reunited.
Maythere be peace in theworld.
May all beings know of Buddha's teachings.
May all the tutelary gods protect us.
May H.H. the Dalai Lama live long and maywe soon meet him...
This is our salt.
That's what our 4 men are going to bring from Lake Tsentso this year.
I don't know ifwe'll find salt there.
They say there are many salt lakes.
Lorries collect the salt mostly from other lakes, butyak caravans go to Lake Tsentso.
Whoever has been to Lake Tsentso will go there again.
We exchange salt for grain.
This year the price of salt is very low.
So we have to keep it for the time being.
Ifthe price goes up, it's good for us.
Ifit stays low, we can't do anything.
It isn't easy to keepyaks.
Fetching salt with yaks is hard work, and then the price for the salt in no way pays us for our effort.
When the salt was worth more, we would exchange it for barley.
But nowadays the value has gone down.
So we have to sell ouryaks to get barley.
Without salt we nomads have no barley either.
Is the Gomshe family sending fouryaks?.
No, threeyaks.
Then we have a total of 1 60 yaks,
40 yaks per man?.
-Three from you?.
-Yes, three.
And 21, that makes 1 60 yaks altogether!
Who is the sheep from?.
It's from Margen.
Margen - The Old Mother
I have a lot of experience because I've been fetching salt for manyyears.
So I can show the others the way and explain to them how it's done.
And besides, I'm the oldest.
Ifwe're in a hurry,
I quickly make some simple tea.
But ifwe have time,
I make real strong butter tea and we have a rest.
That's Margen's work.
I was Margen for manyyears, and they all want me as Margen again.
Margen wishes you all good luck!
Thank you for your wishes, all the best!
Pargen - The Old Father
Is it already 4 o'clock?.
Ifit's alreadyfour, we can gradually start the horse racing.
Yes, we'll soon go outside.
Pargen's best wishes for all of you!
We thankyou foryourwishes. Good luck!
Bopsa is the favourite son ofthe salt men, so they say anyway.
Ah yes.
The favourite son??!.
Oyes, each one of us has a position.
Yes, you each have your position.
One is the Old Mother, one the Old Father and one is Lord of the Animals and one the novice!
Zopon - The Lord of the Animals
The Lord of the Animals wishes good luck!
Thankyou.
Long life and success!
Dear Bopsa, have another!
You're like our only son.
Bopsa - The Novice
Bopsa wishes you all good luck!
Yes, thankyou!
Bopsa's nose quivers when he drinks!
They say that in the olden days a woman once went to the salt lake to get salt.
She was so greedy that she took an awful lot of salt and stuffed it all into her trousers.
That upset the salt lake and made it angry.
Since then women are no longer allowed to go to the salt lake.
That's what people say.
There is a salt language.
But the salt men say that they aren't allowed to use this language in the presence of women.
Women don't go to the salt lake, they aren't allowed to.
I don't know why.
In all my more than 70 years I have never heard ofa woman fetching salt.
There must be some reason for it.
Women don't even turn their faces in that direction.
When my son goes to the salt lake as Lord ofthe Animals I worry a bit about him catching a cold and about other small things.
Otherwise I'm notworried because he really is strong enough and can go on the journey.
People say ifa woman goes to the salt lake the salt disappears, women don't get it.
The reason for this may be because women are different from birth, they are different from men.
The first time I was Bopsa it wasn't very difficult because I had an older man at my side.
That time we went to Lake Biru.
Later on we nearly always went to Tsentso, where my grandson goes now. But there we usually had trouble because ofthe mud.
With the heavy salt sacks on our backs we often sank deep into the muddy ground.
It was hard work.
I and Derma, we fight as equals for the Kingdom Ling.
This has been determined by the gods.
We must ride toJang and take possession of the twelve precious salt lakes.
It is time now to conquer the eighty demonic warriors ofJang.
Margen means that I prepare tea and other things for all of us, as a mother does for her family.
Pargen stands for father.
Pargen and Margen take on the roles offather and mother.
Pargen's jobs are to make burnt offerings, to distribute the meat, to prepare the dumpling soup, and if something has to be discussed, to go to other tents.
There is an old story about the different kinds ofwood:
One day the woods spoke to each other about having to go into the fire ofthe salt men the next day.
All the woods said:
I don't want to go,
I don't want to,
I don't want to go!
But then one wood called Wodu came forward and said:
I shall go by hiding myself under the ground.
Wodu wood is yellowish and only grows under the ground.
When it rains it is difficult to find dung to make a firewith.
But luckily it hardly ever rains at this time of the year.
The journey to Tsentso takes a month and a day or two more.
Ifwewalkfast, it takes just a month.
In the past we used to meet other people almost every day, but nowadays far fewer people live here.
Many days we don't meet even a single soul.
There used to be many tents and many herds.
We even had the problem ofthe animals getting mixed up, so that we kept having to look for them.
Once we get beyond the 'stone goat' behind the pass, we have to start following the rules.
They must be obeyed as from this point.
Even when we are sitting in the tent, each one of us has to take up the right position.
And we are by no means allowed to use bad words.
After passing the "stone goat" we also speak the salt language.
Whateverwe do now, we must obey the rules.
It's the first time for Bopsa.
He's a novice here and is initiated into it like a monk who is entering a monastery.
That's why he also brings us butter and tea as presents.
Everything is new to Bopsa, so we older ones have to show him everything for him to learn.
Today is the day that he is admitted to our community.
As from the Bopsa ceremony he will really belong to the salt men.
We call him Bopsa because there are many things he still can't do.
Whatever he does, he lacks experience.
Nothing works without experience,
Iike this he won't achieve anything.
At the salt lake he has to learn how to extract salt, how deep you're allowed to scrape, how to handle the tools, all kinds oftricks.
And how to carry the sacks, but here it depends on whether he is strong enough.
May the gods be with us on the way there and receive us on the way back.
Hail to the gods and the water spirits.
Protect us from all evil!
The Lamas, meditation gods, sacrificial goddesses, tutelary gods, enemyvanquishers, local gods, the lord ofthe area and all his servants, may they all come and accept the burnt offerings and ablutions.
The gods ofwisdom, the gods ofactivity, the gods of magic power, the Lamas and Tantrics, the earthly tutelary deities, the wish-fulfilling gods ofthe treasure,
Jambhala with all his servants, maythey all accept the offering and make riches fall upon us like rain.
Whereveryou gods appear, may mywishes be fulfilled, obstacles be overcome, illnesses be cured and all negative influences be kept away from me.
May the banners ofbliss rise in all ten directions.
May the lords of the areas, the water spirits, the Ngen, the gods ofthe country, the local gods with their servants, who live in all worlds and in this place, appear and accept the offering.
May the Lamas ofthe three bodies, the Lamas of the three traditions, the peaceful and wrathful deities, the three jewels, the sacrificial goddesses, the gods and guardians of the treasure and all higher creatures accept the pure alcohol offering and fulfil mywishes.
The Earth, the flowers and plants on it, the four continents and Mount Meru, adorned with the sun and the moon,
I shall take them to Buddha as an offering.
May all living creatures be reincarnated in the perfect world.
Good fortune and blessing!
May all you do be successful!
With other salt men we speak only the salt language.
If e.g. at the salt lake someone from our tent meets someone from the neighbouring tent, they speak the salt language.
Anyone who can't speak the salt language isn't respected, especially ifit is an older man.
One thinks badly of someone like that.
The salt language is the salt men's secret language.
When we meet non-nomads we don't use a single word of it.
And especially when women are there we keep the salt language absolutely secret.
We've got that from our forefathers.
That's all I know.
The caravan consists of two parts.
We call the front one Bobyak.
It goes on ahead with the luggage and takes it to the next camp.
The remaining yaks are led by the Lord ofthe Animals to good pastures where he lets them graze in peace.
Where there isn't good grass, he makes them walk faster.
The Bobyak has to be exchanged every day because some ofthese yaks get weak from carrying loads.
That's whywe exchange them and let the others do the carrying.
Where there is good grass
I let the animals walk slowly, and where there is little grass
I drive them a bit.
While the other men go on ahead to the next camp,
I look after the animals.
I make myself some tea, that's all.
In the evening I try to reach the camp with the animals.
At the salt lake, when the others have finished preparing the salt, they send me a message to bring theyaks.
As soon as I get there
I check the saddles and yak carpets.
That's myjob as Zopon, as Lord ofthe Animals.
Doyou live down there?.
Yes, I live down there.
Down there?.
Yes, there.
-You're called Kunga?.
-Yes.
-Would you like some snuff?.
-No.
Was there a lot of snow here this year?.
Not so much,just a little.
But it snowed more back there?.
Yes, there was more snow there.
Was there less here than lastyear?.
Yes. Normallywe have to move...
Doyou?.
...so the animals can survive.
In that case the grass must be better than lastyear?.
Yes, there's more grass here this year.
So that's whyyou didn't move!
This yak has been ill since last night.
It has a twisting ofthe intestines.
It hasn't been well for a few days.
We need somebodywho knows something about this illness.
I don't know how to go about it.
When there isn't enough grass, the animals eat sand.
That's why this has happened.
There's no good grass here.
The other three have gone to look for theyak herd.
But they still aren't backyet, they've been a long time.
We have to find somebody who can help us with theyak!
I'm afraid it will die.
It has to have an operation!
Ifwe have it operated on,
I hope it will survive!
What are we to do with this poor little yak?.
-How are you?.
-Fine.
So we meet after all.
Pardon?.
I thought you wouldn't go to Lake Tsentso this year.
I'm away a lot these days.
Yes.
Yes, then...
You look younger every year.
-Really!?.
-Yes, you do.
Myyaks called Drawu, Rokpu,
Jawu, Zagur, Bandung...
I have lost them all and still haven't found them.
They disappeared in December, still no trace ofthem.
If there really is salt in LakeTsentso, that's good for us.
That's good for you people.
But we can't fetch the salt
Iike the lorries do.
And who knows how deep the mud is?.
It's better than it used to be.
I hope so.
What am I to do?.
I think it's better if the yak has an operation now that we're here at the doctor's.
And then we also need time for the preparations and rituals.
It goes nyok-nyok!
It has already burst.
Already burst!?.
Really!?.
Come here and listen!
Why cause even more suffering?.
An operation is useless and nothing but unnecessary pain.
Come here, come here.
Burst!
Nothing more can be done.
Why kill, when it isn't necessary?.
We people of the land of Dharma don't kill any animals if it isn't necessary.
The animal will die anyway, why cause it additional suffering?.
I promised the salt men that if the yak dies, I'll pay them 200 yuan.
The meat will be eaten.
We shall use it, we don't throw it away.
For me and my people, salt is our life.
Like this time, those people who sent their animals along with us, they also expect us to bring salt back with us when we return.
Therefore we have to do our best.
It's just as the proverb says:
Until victory is won, you have to strive for it.
We have to fight until we've reached our goal.
Isn't that so?.
That's one thing.
And it would also be unthinkable to come home without salt.
That's how it is, we have to do our best.
Pushuk, pushuk, what an awful wind!
We, the warlords Shenpa,
Bernag, Mishang and Ngebum must lead the army against Jang and conquer the precious salt lakes.
Mywarriors from Horwill set up their camp with three different-coloured tents: tents as white as the snow mountains, tents as black as the night, tents as red as blood.
Our people say that Lake Tsentso is the heart of His Holiness Karmapa.
After the death ofthe former Karmapa it was a problem for sixyears to find salt in this lake.
So many salt people went the long way to Lake Yaggen, others to Angtang, to Chuwo or to Lake Biru.
Since Karmapa has been reincarnated there is again salt in Lake Tsentso.
And from year toyear it seems to get better.
This salt lake is the heart of Karmapa!
That's what one used to say, but it really is so!
This is the quality of the salt.
Is this here good?.
No difference, almost as good.
This is from here, and this from over there.
This one looks a bit better.
Which one?.
It's almost the same.
If I scrape the salt together with my golden tool, it makes itselfinto a heap.
The little heaps look like halo-flowers.
There are salt flowers as far as the eye can see.
Ifyou don't know where there is salt, there is salt under my scraper!
Ifyou don't know where the scraper is, the scraper is under the handle.
Grainy, the salt is grainy.
It doesn't depend on efficiency in this work.
It depends on the karma!
And when fetching salt, on the favour ofthe goddess.
Matsenten Gyalmo is the mistress of the
Iake, they say. I don't know much more.
Matsenten Gyalmo - if I imagine her as a human being, she is a woman.
We salt men call her mother.
She is also a goddess who keeps us from starving.
We are deeply grateful to Matsenten
Gyalmo for helping us to live.
When you think ofthe mother at home, then work fast.
When you think of the mother of the salt lake, then work slowly.
When there is no salt in the salt lake it comes from not obeying the rules.
Ifyou pollute the lake, kill here or aren't friendly with each other, the lake doesn't like it, then it isn't willing to give the salt.
I once had to wait a whole month and then I was only able to
Ioad halftheyaks, therewasn't enough salt.
The reason was that we were here in people's communes and the leader of our commune had sleptwith women on theway, and this disturbed the salt lake.
You had towait, and at times it looked as if there was going to be salt - but when you went there, there was again no salt.
More water came and flushed the salt away.
So much salt is in the carrying skin, it is heavy and full to the brim.
The salt is plentiful!
The carrying skin,
Iift it to the right, tip it to the left.
That's how we throw the salt on the heap.
You, nomad from Changtang, don't remain idle, come and work with the salt!
I don't feel lonely.
Since I was 1 3 to 1 4 years old
I've always been herding animals.
My merit is that I can handle animals, that I love them and care for them, not that I'm good at business.
I can't do business or convince others by talking.
I'm no good at smooth talking.
When I talk about responsibility - this may sound like pride - but it is so that the otherthree have far fewer worries.
They do have to go to the salt lake, extract the salt, carry it to the shore, stuff it in sacks. But at night they can sleep peacefully while I always have to worry about the animals.
I do stuffthe salt sack tightly, stuffand stuffthe lower part, so the salt won't float away on the way across the river.
I do stuff the salt sack tightly, stuff and stuff the middle part, so I can rest it on my chest when loading.
I do stuff the salt sack tightly, stuff and stuff the top, so the rain won't wash the salt away.
Hello, Pargen!
Hello!
-Is the salt soon ready?.
-Yes.
So soon?. Quicker than last year!
Yes, this time it went well.
Was it hard work?.
No, it was quite easy.
Then I'll slowly bring the animals round to the salt lake.
Take some snuff!.
Never in my life did it go as quickly as this time, it's like a dream!
Even such things can happen.
An old proverb says: Stay at the salt
Iake for eight days, leave on the 9th, that's how it must be.
Yes, that's the most convenient time.
And that's just the case with us this time. We really are lucky!
That all went so well this time...
That is pure luck!
...is thanks to our local god Tanglha, the Lamas or our own efforts.
The goddess accompanies the salt men all the way right to their front door, where the women and barking dogs greet them.
Yes, that's what one used to say.
The goddess Matsenten Gyalmo has shown us her great favour.
The soft snow this morning is like a water offering for the goddess.
Are there many lorries at the salt lake?.
At first only two, now there are more.
That's never been.
Only so few!?.
Now the yaks, too, will be happy.
The olderyaks, who have been to the salt lake before, think:
We shall go hungry today, but tomorrow we can return to the pastures.
The yaks who have never been here wonderwhy they have to walk so far and yet never get to the grass.
And they can't talk either!
Pull up with the left hand, sew with the right hand, whoever can't do that may not belong to the salt men.
The sack has an opening ofa "to".
Take needle and thread, sew the sack up tightly.
Theyak is wild.
At the opening ofthe sack the thieflurks.
You'll regret not having sewn it well!
Her character is that of a rather angry goddess who is very sensitive to disturbances.
If the men here quarrel, if they sleep with women or break wind at the lake, she reacts very strongly and directly to these things.
Only Margen enjoys a certain freedom here.
He doesn't have to be as careful as we.
The lake forgives him the most.
Bad deeds aren't allowed here, otherwise there's no salt.
Negative actions have the same results.
Nowadays the goddess has become more gentle, that's what the older people say.
I myselfhaven't so much experience here.
The good father is Amu Kangri.
The good mother is Matsenten Gyalmo.
The good sons are Gedun and Busum.
Maywe return to the salt lake next spring with manyyaks, many Bopsas and in good company and return safely back home again.
The Lamas, meditation gods, sacrificial goddesses, tutelary gods...
Mayyou,
Mother Matsenten Gyalmo, accept with pleasure the sacrificial yak.
We, your good sons, return home with joy.
You accept, Mother Gyalmo, accept the offering with joy.
And now the goddess allows us one last shovel of salt.
We, your good sons, return home with joy.
The god of victory in the body of man,
King Gesar,
Iooked at the warriors with the eyes of the ruler and the merciful.
And he gave them the initiation ofthe ninefold Vajra and the transformation of the soul.
Finally the great
King Gesar raised his divine voice and sang the song of the conquest of the twelve salt lakes, ofthe capture of Yulha and ofthe subjugation ofJang.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
After a return journey of 45 days the caravan came back to their families.
For one more year the salt secured them their living.
The systematic modernization increases the serious threat to the right of existence of the Tibetan salt nomads and so to the last feeling of freedom in this country.
With the decline ofthe salt men's tradition another part of cultural identity of the Tibetans will be lost.
This film is dedicated to the salt men and their families.
Our most sincere thanks go to Margen,
Pargen, the Lord of the Animals and Bopsa for having allowed us to accompany them on their extraordinary journey.
Come on!
This is heavy!
Come on.
We have no time now.
Everything must be set right... or the master will be unhappy.
Let's go. Come on.
Madam, since I've been serving you for 24 years... may I ask you, why must you do this?
Please.
At least not on your birthday.
I'm 40 years old.
It is time to do something.
Otherwise,
I'll feel sorry for myself.
You're not gonna tell me something's wrong with the banquet, are you?
This is so tight,
I could hardly breathe.
Madam, everything's fine with the banquet.
Good.
I had a strange dream last night.
I dreamed that my lord had taken a second wife.
- He was so happy.
- You know how it is.
A man is happier the more wives he has.
Are you suggesting that I should consider...
May not be such a bad idea.
- I will do it then.
- Madam!
Madam Kang is dying!
Her blood is everywhere!
Come quick!
Mother, may I?
Go, go, go.
Don't disturb me.
I'm busy.
Madam Kang is dying.
Her baby refuses to be born.
No, you will not go.
Ailian, it is your
40th birthday party.
Lord, madam is worried that it might damage... our young lord's marriage to the Kangs' daughter... if she does not go over to help.
It will be a while before the guests arrive.
I will personally make sure that she is not late for the banquet.
Be late... and you will no longer belong to the Wu family!
Hey! Come back here!
Stop right now!
Communist, come back!
Be careful, madam.
I'm sorry.
Sorry. No men are allowed.
Someone is in labour right now.
Thank God you've come, madam.
Meichen.
It's Ailian.
Can you hear me?
Sorry, Ailian.
Forgive me for not telling you.
Too embarrassed.
It's all right.
It's good fortune to have a baby, even after 40.
No, please!
- You can't go in!
- Don't let him come in!
He can't go in there.
Father, I beg you.
Mother's dying.
The foreign doctor has come.
Where's the hot water?
Mr Kang, I've studied medicine.
I can help.
Leave me alone.
Doesn't he know that it's forbidden for men to see such things?
What if I can save her life?
Madam Kang will lose all face.
She would rather die than have any man but her husband see her there.
What good is face if she dies?
Pray for her.
I must talk to you before I die.
Please, take care of Lin Yi for me.
- Is she still conscious?
- Yes.
Andre, no!
I'm sorry.
Get out! Get out!
Get me a pan of hot water and some fresh towels.
Now!
Has your mother returned yet?
Where is she?
Lord.
Old Lady was wondering why we couldn't start yet.
She's losing patience.
You tell her we're almost ready.
What are we going to do?
Women. Never trust a woman!
- I heard you shouted at Madam Wu.
- Did I?
You know their family.
They own half this town.
You know that I needed her help, and she did help.
I've worked too hard here to let you make trouble for me.
Father! Father!
My master wants to give this to you.
I appreciate your master's kindness, but I cannot accept this.
Please give it back to him.
How dare you make all of us wait for you!
Madam Kang will live... and there is a foreign man, a priest.
Go apologize to my mother and guests.
We talk after dinner.
Let her be, my son.
Come sit by me, my daughter-in-law.
Let us begin.
Enjoy your meal.
If I were him, I'd spend money on a concubine, not a banquet.
The Japanese have virtually taken over Manchuria.
Maybe they will be satisfied, then leave us in peace.
They will never make it that far south.
Fengmo, here comes your future bride.
Welcome, Mr Kang.
Please, follow me.
I can't wait for your wedding banquet.
Daughter-in-law, what kind of a girl are you going to find for my son?
I haven't thought about that yet.
Tell me, why do you want another woman for your husband?
I think it is time for me to retire from my duties.
What do you mean?
I somehow felt... my husband deserves a younger wife.
She's crazy.
My mother tried to kill herself when my second mother came.
And my second mother took poison when my third mother came.
She arranged it all for him.
- I can't believe it.
- Congratulations!
Thank you.
You have such a wonderful wife to arrange a concubine for you.
That's really something.
Let's toast your first concubine.
What?
- What are you talking about?
- Stop pretending to be shy.
We just heard your wife say... you deserve a younger girl.
- But...
- Second wife.
You must invite me to the wedding banquet.
Come on! Gan bei.
- Let me get some more wine.
- Just call a servant.
No. It's my pleasure.
They said you are giving me a concubine.
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you like the idea?
Is there anything else, madam?
No. You can leave now.
Good night.
Ying?
You can call me in the night if you need anything else.
Will you be jealous of her?
I'm 40 years old today.
I'm no longer young.
I like your hair's fragrance.
You had too much to drink today.
Who is she?
And how old is she?
Is she pretty? Look.
I want someone just like you.
It will be all right.
Trust me.
She will serve you better than I.
Will you still take care of me... when the new one comes?
Since that day I marry you... twenty-four years ago... it has been my duty to serve you and make you happy.
I thought...
I would hold you like this until I died.
Father of my sons?
Father of my sons?
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
I think it might be better to put you into younger hands.
Tomorrow. Do it.
I want to go to sleep.
Can we talk just a minute?
No.
Do it now.
Please.
Do it!
Aren't you coming to bed?
No.
I have a bed ready.
Hurry up. Hurry up!
Hey, you, stop!
- Time to eat.
- My God!
- It's very funny.
- What time is it tonight?
My father is going to kill me if he finds out I'm doing it again.
Then don't get caught.
Wait.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
- The matchmaker brought me here.
- Matchmaker?
Oh, no! One is broken.
Thank heaven you're here!
I was terrified!
Stupid, stupid girl.
I told you to follow me.
Why don't you listen?
This girl is so perfect for your family.
Her mother left her, and her foster mother raised her... in order to get a dowry.
If not for the war, she wouldn't give her up so quickly.
If you could be so kind... to add another, say,
50 pieces...
Fine. I need to speak with her alone.
Of course, madam.
I'll leave her to you.
Go. Go!
What is that in your hands?
I told them to bring nothing.
I brought you some fresh eggs,
15 of them.
Not one is older than seven days.
Come closer.
I would like to see them.
But one got broken on the way.
Her feet are so big, like a monkey's.
She's a country girl.
Must have gone barefoot since birth. I think...
I hope you like them.
I had nothing else.
Do you think you would like to stay here?
The matchmaker told my foster mother... that I will not starve here.
She told me to please you above all else.
That necklace is very beautiful.
It's the only thing I have from my real mother.
What is your name?
I have no real name.
My foster mother called me
Little Orphan when I was small... and Big Orphan when I got big.
I can give you a name if you wish.
Chiuming.
It means "bright autumn."
You will bring the brightness to my lord's autumn.
Yes. I like it.
Don't you?
Mother, do you think a young girl would suit a family like ours?
It's very generous of your wife to arrange it for you.
More grandchildren will make the Wu family even greater.
There is a law forbidding concubines now.
- These matters are not for children.
- Grandmother.
I'm not a child.
I'm 18 years old.
The Kang family has requested that...
Fengmo will receive some foreign education... before he marries the daughter.
Ask the priest from the orphanage that you met at the Kangs'.
He can teach Fengmo.
- I do not want to be married!
- Fengmo.
The priest can come in, but not his god.
Madam Wu has requested that I come for an interview.
He's here. The foreigner.
The same man you met at Madam Kang's.
And he said you sent for him.
Send him in.
Don't stand there with your mouth open like a fish.
It's a pleasure to see you again, lady.
Please forgive my rudeness.
Please sit down.
I should thank you for saving my best friend's life.
We did it together, didn't we?
How would you prefer
I address you?
I forgot to ask your name last time.
May I borrow your brush?
You can call me Andre.
You can write in Chinese?
Yes.
- How long have you been here?
- Three years.
Have some tea.
What country are you from?
I was born in America, but China is my home now.
What made you come to China?
My church asked for volunteers, and... well, here I am.
I have heard you have an orphanage.
Why would a foreign man like you... like orphanage work?
It's a job for women.
Why should such a pleasurable and important job be done by women only?
Do you miss your family?
I don't have a family.
Your parents didn't arrange a wife for you?
No. I'm not married.
Is it because of your religion?
Yes. I'm a priest.
Sister Shirley tells me you're looking for a tutor for your youngest son.
Yes. How much are your fees?
I don't require any fees.
Thank you for your kindness, but... it would put the Wu family in a lower position... if you didn't accept the fees, wouldn't it?
No, not at all.
We all have the same position in the eyes of God.
Then we should give the money to your god.
I'd rather not take money, but...
I will accept some clothing and food... for the children of the orphanage.
That can be arranged.
Thank you, madam.
Classes will begin the week after the wedding.
I hope you understand, our Old Lady... does not want you to talk about your religion in your class.
Grandma!
- Is he your grandson?
- Yes.
I have three sons and two grandchildren.
I'm sorry. Ying?
- Where's Ying?
- It's all right.
I like kids.
Come, come.
Come here.
I don't bite.
What is this?
A lion? A dog?
Get out of the way!
Young Lord, this is your teacher.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Congratulations on your wedding.
It's my father's wedding.
I'm sorry.
Madam Wu invited me to this wedding.
- I would never think...
- Congratulations, Mr Wu.
You see, in America, men have only one wife.
You're not in America now.
Forgive me.
What do you think about getting a second mother?
I think it's disgusting.
My father has young wives.
But I'm the daughter of the first wife.
Great.
Foolish thing!
What is there to fear?
Just lie back... and it be over soon!
Consider how lucky you are.
Do you have a home to run to?
Or a mother to give you rice?
Just obey your duty... and you can grow fat and comfortable... like me!
Your hands... are like a washboard!
Please forgive me, lord.
You are hurting me!
What's wrong with you?
Stupid girl.
Take off your clothes.
Come... over... here.
Lord, I beg you, please don't!
Open your mouth.
Lord, please, I beg you!
- Good morning, lady.
- From now on... you must call me Elder Sister, not lady.
Yes, lad...
Elder Sister.
You are a member of the Wu family now.
Sweeping the floor is the servants' job... not yours, child.
Yes, Elder Sister.
I hope you understand...
I put the entire happiness of our lord in your hands.
Fengmo, what do you want?
I've just come to see you, Mother.
How are you feeling?
I'm quite well. Why don't you say good morning to your second mother?
Good morning, Second Mother.
You should know the family rules.
Send a servant to let me know before you come.
She's so young, and Father is so old.
Send her home.
This is not something for you to decide.
Mother, this is wrong.
Andre says that even in Western countries... everyone is supposed to have a monogamous relationship.
Well, how does a foreigner know about Chinese?
Fengmo, police! Move!
Let's go!
Stop!
It was my father-in-law's library.
My husband had it closed after he died.
I've read most of the books here.
Dream of the Red Chamber.
You don't know how many times I've read this.
Do you think a woman is capable of learning as much as a man... or is her mind inferior?
Inferior?
No, but they certainly are different.
Do you think a woman is happier... if she reads less?
I don't know.
But I do know that a book doesn't know whether a man or woman is reading it.
If this is satisfactory,
I'll have them clean it for you.
It's perfect.
Madam?
Young Lord is in jail.
Why?
They said he is involved with Communist activity.
Nonsense! I have to go get him.
Madam, you are a woman.
You can't.
But how can I tell the lord?
We're expected at
Madam Chiang Kai-shek's reception... for the American ambassador to Nanking.
Here's the invitation.
He is suspected of being a Communist.
Without an order from the Shanghai police bureau...
I can't release him.
Are you suggesting that I tell
Madam Chiang... that you would prefer to keep her guest in jail?
May I have your name, please?
Is that really a letter from Madam Chiang?
Yes, it is, thanking me for opening up the orphanage.
How did you know he couldn't read English?
I took a chance.
The lamp is the sun.
The Earth.
The moon.
So, the Earth moves...
Around the sun.
And the moon moves around the sun. Yes or no?
Yes and no.
Excellent.
My grandmother is the sun.
My father is the Earth.
My mother is the moon.
And I cannot escape their gravity.
Interesting.
My parents don't care if the Japanese are right next door.
And our government is more interested in making money from the war... than in fighting them.
So what are you saying?
This concubine thing makes me sick.
She's just a girl my age.
This place stinks like a mouldy tomb.
They want me to be like them.
I must get out of here.
Then why don't you go?
Saying and doing... two different things.
Let's get back to astronomy.
It's important to keep studying, no matter what happens.
Fengmo, you're a very lucky young man.
A total lunar eclipse... occurs once every 18 years in the same place... and we can see one tonight.
When the Earth blocks the sun's light from reaching the moon... the moon seems to disappear in the Earth's shadow.
Here.
My mother likes to look at the stars too.
It's beautiful.
Mother.
Andre's brought a telescope.
We've been looking at the moon.
Both hands.
- I can't see anything.
- No, try again.
Is that better?
Mother, why don't you come to class?
Chiuming can come with you if you think it doesn't look right.
She can study too.
That way you won't be the only woman.
I'd be honoured if you joined us, lady.
I do not know how to keep from getting pregnant... when I sleep with the father of my sons.
Another baby will surely kill me... but how do I compete with my husband's younger wives?
Fengmo's tutor told him
American men... can only have one wife.
It is so pitiful you had to find a concubine for your husband.
The girl... where did you find her?
You like her?
Does he like her?
I like her.
She's an ordinary girl... but a good one.
You sound like you hired a maid.
Meichen, I feel like a frog... living in a well... only seeing the small portion of the sky.
I have wanted to visit you many times, Ailian... to discuss our children's wedding.
But since that foreigner is there, it would be too shameful for me to meet...
He saved your life, Meichen.
Besides, he's just a priest.
Fengmo even suggested that Second Lady and I... should join the class with him.
You seem so changed, Ailian.
You got one!
- I caught a duck!
- There he is!
Madam, I believe this is yours.
Thank you.
Please, go away.
Go away.
Good-bye, ladies.
It's all right.
He's gone.
He scared me to death.
Did you see his hairy chest?
No wonder they say that foreigners are half animal.
My little precious!
My poor little baby.
Are you all right?
Lady! Lady! I must speak to you about the foreigner.
He must have starved to death in his past life.
It's because of your generosity he takes all the leftovers... you usually give to the servants.
Mother, the day after tomorrow is Andre's birthday.
- We must have a banquet for him.
- A banquet?
Young Lord, he's not family.
I don't think Old Lady and your father will agree.
I have an idea.
Foreigners like a huge cake... with a candle in the middle for their birthday.
All right.
We can make one for him.
But how big?
Big enough.
I saw these yesterday.
I thought you might like them.
Come see. Take it. Take it.
I like the way you massage me.
Take a seat.
I've been worried about Fengmo.
Perhaps you should attend a few classes... and make sure everything's all right with him.
You must be joking.
I would fall asleep.
Why don't you go?
Perhaps... if Chiuming came with me.
I will tell my mother.
I can't relax with her!
She doesn't know how to comfort me. You could.
No, you must not think of me that way.
It is unfair to Chiuming.
Unfair?
You are so naive.
She's just a puppet.
How could you buy a puppet with a heart?
She cannot compare with you.
I only do this because you made me.
Do it, now.
Now.
Ying!
Madam, I'm here.
I'm too old.
I can't take care of you forever.
Any questions?
I have a question.
I hope you don't mind.
Not at all.
Have you ever seen your god?
I thought we were prohibited from discussing religion.
This is not religion.
Why don't you tell us?
No, I have never seen Him.
How can you believe in what you can't see?
Faith.
He's in everything.
In bread. In water.
In sleeping. In waking.
In feeding the lost children.
Teaching Fengmo and Chiuming, and talking to you now.
Faith.
Is it selfish if any individual puts his happiness...
before the happiness of his family?
But if a person is unhappy, how can he serve his family?
A question.
Are all Chinese marriages arranged?
Marriage has to be arranged.
- Why?
- Marriage is a family matter.
And family is the most important obligation here.
Our sorrows and joys belong to the family.
What happens when we die?
That's always a very good question.
When we die...
our soul will be free.
Then I can't wait for my soul to be free.
I always wonder...
why Western people like to go to church...
to confess how guilty they are.
Well, I always wonder why Chinese people like to pray for more money...
sons and beautiful wives.
Are people in your country...
allowed to do things that are forbidden by society?
In theory, everyone's equal...
and has the right to pursue whatever makes them happy.
I don't think
I have that kind of right.
I've got something to show you.
I brought a photo of my sister and my mother... so you can see how Western women dress.
That's my mother and sister.
They're so beautiful.
You must miss them very much.
Is that you?
You were so cute.
- Big and hairy now.
- Like a bear.
Who is laughing so loudly?
Your son and your wives, lord.
They are having classes.
Here's the birthday steam cake.
Be careful. It's hot.
Long life, teacher.
How did you know it was my birthday?
- We made a cake for you.
- Eat it while it's hot.
I put a lot of sugar, sweet beans and dried fruits in there.
I had to steam it for two hours.
The candle kept falling down.
It's all right now.
But be careful.
Hey!
Why did you blow out the candle?
I worked so hard.
I made a wish.
Doesn't it smell delicious?
You first.
You don't like it?
No. I like it very much.
We just want you to feel you're at home.
Fire!
The orphanage is on fire!
God!
Stay there.
It's too late!
Give me some water.
Give me some water!
- Are you all right?
- Elder Sister!
Breathe. Are you all right?
Where are they taking them?
Our lady has ordered to move the children... to the Wu compound.
Let it go.
You gained two kilos.
But it's all in your ears.
It's mine! It's mine!
You can't get me.
Children.
What have you done?
He's dead.
- You killed him.
- He's dead.
You killed him!
Here's something sweet.
I hope the children enjoy their watermelon.
Madam, thank you.
We appreciate it very much.
Never mind.
Thank you.
You're alive.
That's all that matters.
You know, I think
Second Wife is distracted.
Her heart is somewhere else.
Once she has a baby, she will be part of the Wu family... and her heart will be settled.
Madam, would you send me away if I said something... that might make you angry?
Have I ever sent you away yet?
Go on.
I think you should not have risked your life saving that foreigner.
- People are talking.
- About what?
Unmentionable things.
If I hadn't gone into that burning orphanage...
Andre...
I mean, that foreigner and his children would be dead.
I think we should not let Old Lady find out about what happened.
Very strange.
Those foreigners... they like to hold your hands to show their appreciation.
Makes me embarrassed.
Madam, if I were you...
I would not let that foreigner touch one hair on my body.
You even let him stay on our compound.
And the servants, they do not like serving people from the orphanage.
You should see lord's face.
He's not happy with this either.
What else?
I think you should arrange for Fengmo's marriage... and make the orphans go away from this house as soon as possible.
I thought I had lost it.
I knew it was yours.
The clasp was broken, so...
I fixed it.
Thank you.
Why don't you put it on so you don't lose it again?
Let me help you.
It's the only thing you have from your mother... isn't it?
Electricity. It sounds good.
But it's a waste of money.
Hey, bring me some tea.
Wu, how 'bout your new wife?
Don't be so shy.
You're part of the club now.
We all have several wives.
Isn't that so?
I'm so used to the first wife.
Second Wife, she doesn't know how to take care of me.
I have an idea.
Come with us to the flower boat.
There you can really relax, huh?
- No, my mother would never allow me.
- Your mother?
Come on!
In the dark there's no difference... between a concubine and a flower girl.
That's right.
No, no, no, I can't.
I can't.
Leave him alone.
Go home to your wives.
We'll go there without you.
Let's go.
Is my son gonna be absent from the table tonight again?
Chiuming, where has your husband been the last few nights?
Ancient, he's been going out with Mr Kang.
Daughter-in-law...
I hope you haven't been so busy attending classes... and taking care of the orphans... that you have neglected your duty to the others.
Yes.
Let's eat.
There's my father. Look.
Fengmo, there's your father too.
- Hey, don't let him get away.
- I can't.
- So shameful.
- Grab him. Bring him back here.
Awful. I really wish I wasn't from this family.
Madam! Madam!
Old Lady says she's not going.
She's afraid of this electricity.
Lord says he cannot go either.
Should I still put the basket in the boat?
No, we cannot go without them.
Mother, everyone is going.
The Wu family will lose face if your mother appears without your father... at the celebration.
- Maybe I shouldn't go.
- No.
We are going.
Just wait till Old Lady finds out about this.
Electricity!
And so... we bring our humble town... into the modern age.
Electricity.
Electricity.
Why?
Can you tell me why?
Could you translate?
I don't understand the dialect.
All right.
This is a story about a girl... who had to disguise herself as a boy... in order to go to school.
In the three years, we shared the same window.
- My feelings for you...
- I can understand.
My feelings for you grew as deep as the sea.
In pairs birds fly.
Lovers' shadows... forever entwined.
Your smile makes my heart break.
But you know my father has already arranged my marriage.
A thousand words in my heart.
Still, to express my feelings...
I know not where to start.
What?
Nothing.
I miss you.
I cannot sleep at night.
I miss you.
- They flew away together.
- I eat but do not taste.
I miss you.
I pick up the brush but cannot write.
I miss you.
Without you my life is a waste.
I miss you.
They were separated... and died from love sickness... and were buried together.
A pair of butterflies... emerged from their grave... and flew away together.
If I cannot be with you in this life...
Then I will be with you in the next.
You know the story?
All love stories end the same, don't they?
This is a Western butterfly story.
It's one of my favourite operas.
Just listen.
Why do all love stories end in tragedy?
Someday you will understand.
No, Mother, I want to know.
Is love a sin?
Love is never sinful.
It's the most beautiful feeling we can have.
I'm sorry. I think we're forbidden to talk about this topic.
- What if love is forbidden?
- Fengmo, stop it.
Teacher, Mr Wu would like to speak to you.
Let's stop now.
I hope you understand.
It is not appropriate to talk about relationships... between a man and a woman in my house.
What's wrong?
Father, some boys threw stones and mud at us.
They said we are bananas... yellow on the outside, white on the inside.
They say you like that rich Wu lady.
It's all right.
Let's wash up.
It's all right.
I have been concerned about the rumours.
It's not only your face.
It affects all of our reputations.
"Create in me a clean heart,
O God."
Now that you have enough foreign education... you will marry the Kangs' daughter on the moon festival.
- I do not love her.
- Love?
Nonsense.
Your marriage was decided before the two of you were born.
If you force me, I will join the Communist army.
Then you are not my son.
You must be careful of the foreigner.
You do not know who he is and what he really is up to.
I don't understand why you trust him so much.
Old Lady wants to move that foreign devil out of the Wu compound.
Lady, I'm so concerned about you.
It seems you don't watch out any more.
Are you listening to...
Good evening, Elder Sister.
What are you doing here at this hour?
- Where is Fengmo?
- I haven't seen him.
- I just saw you right here with him.
- It's not true!
You think I'm blind?
I hope you understand.
Your job is to serve your husband.
He doesn't like me.
He kicks me out of the bed.
I don't know what to do.
- He goes to the flower boat.
- You lie again.
It's true. I swear it!
It's true.
It's also true you're Fengmo's second mother. Who do you think you are?
I shouldn't have brought you here.
Daughter-in-law... is the priest still living in the servants' quarters?
The orphanage is being repaired, Mother.
We give you money to run the family, not on someone else.
Teacher?
I have a question.
Can't it wait until class?
If we die, our soul will be free, right?
Yes, that's true.
I heard you saved the foreigner from the fire and went to the opera with him.
Does the priest teach class about men and women?
Move him out of my house.
Help!Somebody help!
Second Lady has killed herself!
Stay here!
What is he doing?
She's conscious.
Let me die!
Stupid girl. She can't even play dead correctly.
She's going to be all right.
I have to speak with you.
Thank you for saving her.
I can't imagine what would have happened today without you.
- I have one request.
- Anything.
Let her go.
I can't.
- It's beyond my power.
- You brought her here.
You can set her free.
I'm sorry. I can't.
How can I face my family?
What would people say?
What would people think if they knew
Fengmo was in love with her?
How did you know that?
She told me.
She'd rather die than live here any longer.
Shameless.
Ruin the name of the Wu family.
- She seduced my son.
- Seduced?
You brought her here!
If I didn't, she could have died of hunger.
Why are you so cold?
You sacrificed that young girl... on the bed of a man old enough to be her father!
Did you really think you could free yourself by imprisoning another?
Who do you think you are?
A saviour?
You come to China to save our Chinese children... to save us?
Why don't you go to your country to save yourself and your country first?
I thought I knew you.
Good-bye, lady.
A long time ago... there was a little frog who lived at the bottom of an old well.
He thought... the sky was just this little patch of blue... above his head.
- He had no idea...
- Madam Wu!
Where's my son?
Where's my grandson?
Where's my daughter-in-law?
Heaven! Are you trying to break my old bones?
Ying!
Where the hell are they?
- I will go look for them.
- Go, go!
Why don't you come home with me?
Two wives not enough for you, Mr Wu.
Come home with me.
She is free now.
You can be free too.
But... she is young.
- Times have changed.
- And you're so old.
The other day... when you gave me that birthday dumpling or whatever it was... that's the first time I celebrated my birthday since I was a child.
I feel like I belong here now.
Come.
Here. Can you walk?
Let me help you.
Put me down.
- Let me take a look.
- I'm fine.
Let me see.
I'm a doctor, remember?
- It's all right.
- Let me see.
Maybe you sprained it.
Does that hurt?
- Yes?
- It's all right.
It's all right.
Why are you crying?
Where have you been?
On your knees!
Beg for forgiveness from your ancestors.
Ancestors, I beg for your forgiveness.
Apologize for driving your second wife away!
Forgive me for driving my second wife away.
Beg for forgiveness for breaking the family rules!
I beg for forgiveness for breaking family rules.
Beg for forgiveness for losing face.
I beg for forgiveness for losing face.
Beg for forgiveness...
Great Grandma!
It is a blessing that she did not live to see this war.
I've heard the Japanese have killed hundreds of people in the north.
May I pray for her?
Pray then.
My mother can have one more heaven to go to.
Forgive me, Father.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
You are not really leaving, are you?
I am.
Where are you going?
As far away as possible.
Fengmo, I'm sorry.
It's hard for me to explain to you.
You're my son.
But I think only you can understand.
Mother... how could you?
How can I understand you... when you bought a girl to warm my father's bed?
How can I understand you... when you drove Chiuming to try to kill herself?
How can I understand you... when my father visits the flower boat every night?
How can I understand you when you betray us with my teacher?
Because... it has taken me 40 years... to feel the way you feel about Chiuming.
I have come to say good-bye.
I am joining the Communist army.
So you've decided.
You can find Chiuming in the missionary school near Wuxi church.
How's your mother?
Changed.
Go see her.
Thank you for all you have done.
Take care of my mother.
God bless you.
I've heard... you sent a message to tell the foreigner... to come for my care.
Yes.
I told the servants not to give him your message.
Why?
I'm not dead yet!
Children! Children, in the house!
Put your things down!
Inside! Inside!
In the house, hurry!
Quickly, in the house!
Get in, hurry!
Under the bed!
Now! There's no more time.
Now! Go down!
Get on the boat!
Get on the boat!
I'm not leaving.
You want to die?
- I'm not leaving with you.
- Get on the boat!
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.
Come with me, woman.
Now!
Not this time.
I've served you for 24 years.
Not any more.
- Listen! You belong to me.
- No. I belong to nobody.
You're nobody without the Wu family!
Don't leave me alone!
I'm scared!
If you no longer care for me, think of your sons!
My lord is looking for her!
They had a fight and she disappeared.
Take the children.
I'll meet you at Wuxi church.
It's too dangerous.
The Japanese have taken the town.
She must be trapped there!
Daughter?
Where are you, daughter?
Last night a foreign priest asked me... if I was still alive to give this to you.
- He was here?
- He saved our lives.
Tell me. Where is he?
Tell me the names that
Father Andre had given you, children.
Honesty.
Kindness.
Faith.
Truth.
- Humanity.
- Mercy.
- Light.
- Grace.
- Sunbeam.
- Star.
Dawn.
Charity.
Rose.
Mother, I don't have a name.
Your name will be Love.

You took it upon yourseIf at the Seibukan request.

We beIong to the force.

It was aII my fauIt sir.

It's as good a nationaI treasure.
So it's priceIess.
Thank God
Rio GrandoI didn't take it away.
We need it to fund our MartiaI Arts Centre.
How did the poIice find out?
I aIIowed the two men to handIe too much money.
But I sense an informer.
It was probabIy Masaoka from the Seibukan SchooI.
Masaoka?
Among his pupiIs is...
..Sergeant Yamagami.
The Seibukan men are dangerous.

I can't do it Father.
Your souI is not ready.
Make your mind a totaI bIank.
You are stiII preoccupied.
- Try again.
- Yes sir!
I'II try again.
Don't teII me they fired you.
No. I asked to work on the case fuII time.
To repair my error.
And after some argument they Iaid me off.
I consider it permission to go ahead in my own way.
Just Iike you.
Look.
Otaguro eIiminated the two men we'd marked.
I think it proves the importance of his scheme.
The Asian MartiaI Arts Centre that is.
He's aIready raised more than five biIIion yen from Asian countries.
That much?
And I think he has a 'big brother' supporting him.
What do you mean?
I mean the Mafia is behind him.
The poIice have been working on
FBI information.
But no evidence so far.
If that's reaIIy the case it's awfuI for our nation.
Kono! Kono!
Send word to aII our Asian chapters.
To investigate the way
Otaguro raises money.
If there's anything dodgy have witnesses come to Japan immediateIy.
Yes sir.
By the way I want to know more about Tsurugi.
Tsurugi?
Where does he come in?
No ordinary man couId've done what was done to the two men.
Damaging the vocaI cords with fingers.
The way he acted with his hands shackIed.
It reminded me of Takuma Tsurugi.
If it's him you have a dangerous enemy Yamagami.
He is a genius.
I fought him once.
I met his Iate father whiIe we were in China through karate.
Mr Yamagami give me a Iesson.
HeIIo Kazuko.
You must be making progress.
Your eyes are shining.
AIright I'II give you a work out.
That's it Kazuko.
- PIease!
- OK!
You reaIIy are good.
Otaguro.
I've come as a feIIow karate man to give you advice... or rather a break a chance to think it over.
I'm shocked to hear those words from you Masaoka.
I aIso beIieve in bushido.
How wouId I do such a thing?
I wish you weren't.
But the poIice investigations...
Wait.
Look at that.
Construction wiII start very soon.
I'm absoIuteIy on the IeveI.
If this can't convince you nothing can.
Otaguro.
I had a good reason to say what I just said to you.
ReaIIy?
If you refuse to reconsider we'II have to meet again.
I've been expecting you.
No wonder he's the number one in the Arabic countries.

This is the pIan.
What I want to know is the actuaI dates of construction.

I can't give the dates yet.
How about the cost?
Who authorised you to ask such things?
Do you have a warrant?
If not forget it.
Our guest is Ieaving.
Do something!
Stop it... Stop!
Stop...
You've given me an idea of what you are up to.
Who needs music for training?
I Iove this song.
It aIways takes me back to Okinawa.
I have no parents back home.
Just their graves.
StiII it's my home.
Cut those Okinawa things out!
Such harsh words...
But I won't say anything back to you.
If you hadn't picked me up when I was starving where wouId I be?
I owe you a Iot.
Ouch!

Who's this from?
How do you know me?
What was he Iike?
KILL KENDO MAS AOKA
Takuma!
Are you afraid of Masaoka?
Say what you Iike.
I just can't.
You've got to.
RidicuIous.
You can't controI me just because you pay me.
You ought to know where you stand.
It's no use threatening me.
You know that I'm not part of your team anyway.
WeII?
His roIe is over.
He knows too much.
He knows too much.
Knows too much.
TeII me why.
Why turn him down?
I'm aIso a human being.
Masaoka is the onIy man who understands me.
For that they'II kiII you.
Then you're wasting your Iife.
This coId gets me.
What made you come here anyway?
We stiII have time.
Let's go back to Tokyo.
Takuma!
Are you hurt?
You are!
Takuma!
Takuma!
You've got quite a physique.
An athIete?
Ping-pong? Badminton?
Anyway I do karate a bit.
I've got to fourth Dan.
Fourth Dan. Did you hear me?
It's a great thing karate.
It has OrientaI mystique.
Defence can be offence.
The master toId me there's nothing to be afraid of except starvation.
So I ate too much and I keep gaining weight.
My chop can reverse the heart
Iike this!
It's so powerfuI it turns the heart upside down.
Hey take a Iook at this.
This is Matsuba Kuzushi.
My throat hurts a IittIe in here though.
And wouId you beIieve?
I can break a rock.
How embarrassing.
Heat does harm to karate chops.
You'd better remember that.
We karate fighters caII it a burn.
Do you?
Don't worry.
I'm can stiII do some damage.
For instance...
I've got to fourth Dan!
This is the head of the Rangoon Chapter.
One night he disappeared.
A week Iater he was found dead in the harbour.
I remember him. A devoted man.
It turned out that he was eIiminated by the Mafia.
We found this in his desk.
A 1 00000 doIIar donation was demanded.
By Otaguro.
A threatening Ietter.
In New DeIhi three men were forced to make contributions.
One of them had to give up his jeweIs.
Now we have enough evidence to question Otaguro thoroughIy.
Takuma wait!
Not the Mafia again.
I wanted peace tonight.
Did the Mafia send you as weII?
No Takuma don't go!
It's dangerous.
Takuma! Takuma!
Takuma! You can't go!
Shikenbaru...
Yes it's me Shikenbaru.
Stab us!
Together!
I thought you were dead.
Not untiI I kiII you Tsurugi.
I'II Iive to see that day.
This is the age of advanced medicaI deveIopments.
Even a heart can be transpIanted.
If you have the wiII to Iive and enough money they can give you artificiaI vocaI cords.
CertainIy the Mafia sent me to get you.
But remember even if they hadn't
I'd do it myseIf.
Because I survived so that I couId kiII you.
Come Tsurugi.
Some pIace where nobody wiII get in.
Takuma!
Takuma...
Takuma!
This is an insuIt.
You caIIed me here onIy to incriminate me.
It shows how much you want me out of the martiaI arts worId! Good day!
Wait.
We have concrete evidence.
- Kono!
- Yes!
Meet Mr Ken Mao form Rangoon.
And Mr Gorasing
New DeIhi Chapter of WKL.
You've been demanding donations under the pretext of buiIding the Asian MartiaI Arts Centre.
You bIackmaiI weaIthy peopIe.
You even rob those who are short of cash...
..taking their expensive statuettes or jeweIs.
Those who are reIuctant are got rid of by assassins.
We even have the threatening
Ietters you wrote to them.
Not onIy that - according to Yamagami's report you have no intention of buiIding the Centre at aII.
FaIse site. FaIse pIans.
The biIIions of yen you raised were sent to the States.
No!
That's not true.
You are a bad Ioser Otaguro.
Your schooI is the Japanese front for the Mafia.
Isn't it?
You coIIected as much as you couId in Asian countries and contributed to their vauIts.
But not any more.
I couId report it to the poIice.
But I haven't.
As a feIIow martiaI arts master
I'm giving you a chance to decide what to do.
We're in troubIe.
Yes I know.
Otaguro to the Mafia your mistake is unforgivabIe.
Now I'm going to be in direct charge here.
We don't need you anymore.
- Imura.
- Yes.
Let's have a toast.
Cheers!
PIease start.
What is it?
Yamagami!

Takuma.
Don't trust anybody.
Be your own man.
You are the only one you can turn to.
Train yourself. body and mind.
Don't let anybody get the better of you.
Takuma. Do you recognise me?
Takuma... You've been aImost dead for three days.
Have some.
You've been with me for three days?
Oh it's nothing.
You've got to get out of Tokyo.
And you?
Don't worry about me.
They never spare a traitor the Mafia.
So you knew about me.
That voice on the tape.
You couIdn't fix that up yourseIf.
I'm sorry.
As a matter of fact I have been watching you for the Mafia.
What I said about
Okinawa was true though.
I have no mother or father that's the truth too.
But...
What I never said was that they'd made me cuItivate you.
Do whatever you want with me.
What I want to do is...
..to get Otaguro for Masaoka.
Otaguro's been kiIIed.
So has Yamagami.
- What?
- They hurt Master Masaoka.
His schooI is finished.
Are you sure?
You are a genius.
The damned Mafia!
Let me go! Stop!
Go!
Boke...
Boke!
Tsurugi...
Tsurugi...
Run...
Run away quick!
What a rotten shame.
Where are they?
Tsurugi. I knew you'd come.
She finaIIy taIked about you surviving.
And here you are.
So you're the boss.
I'm not big enough to be caIIed a boss.
I'm Don CosteIIo
Head of the Far East Headquarters.
Don CosteIIo?
She betrayed us by heIping you.
She paid for it.
I'II teII you something.
We intended to...
..controI the whoIe Asian karate worId.
But you and Masaoka tried to stop us.
I'm sorry.
You have to die.
You asked for it.
Wait.
Let me kiII him.
That particuIar man.
I'II kiII him.
This time.
OK.
Tsurugi.
Are you ready?
AIright.
Tsurugi come on.
KiII him!
Get him!

THE END
Don't kid yourself,
Veronica.
There will be repercussions.
Highly aware of that.
Tell me again what happened last night.
This little girl told me her mother was pimping her out.
So she beat the mother's ass to a pulp.
Oh, you didn't want to call the police, or all the phones were broken?
You just decided to turn into the Incredible Hulk?
I didn't decide anything, Chloe.
I don't know.
I just got so mad
I couldn't see straight.
Out of control.
Oh, you're real tough.
Real tough.
Number one!
Speaking of out of control.
Looks like it's the Italians versus the Irish.
Happy St. Patrick's Day.
What are you doing out on a holiday that's got nothing to do with you?
Stop it. Come on.
Shut up, stupid.
Exactly.
Ow!
Was that a green bagel?
Threw a bagel at me?
Are you nuts?
How did the Jews get mixed up in this?
Come on! Sit down.
Hey, dude, come on now.
We're all good Catholics here, right?
Sit down.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Gina, shut up.
Shut up.
I heard about Lauren Kempton.
I'm so sorry.
What happened?
She died last night.
Sone.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's sad.
She was a good lady.
Kiss my ass, guido.
You know what?
Why don't I give you another beating, huh, tough guy?
Security!
Security!
Get a little help here?
Okay, I think that's our cue.
Somebody!
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with these people?
Hey!
Congratulations on making it to 11:00 am before needing medical attention.
You are the champions of stupid.
Sit down!
Now!
That was kind of hot,
Chloe.
Gotta do what you gotta do.

I'm supposed to see Klowden to find out how much trouble I'm in, but you know what?
You don't do that to a kid.
That woman was evil.
You pick up the phone.
You call the police.
You know, if I were a man, none of this would be a big deal.
Yeah, if you were a man.
If you hadn't shot someone a week ago.
If you hadn't thrown a cinder block through Harris' window.
Okay.
All right, people.
That's enough.
That is enough.
Yeah, what he said.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh.
What the hell is going on here?
New medical show called
Cutting-Edge Medicine.
They're doing a piece on me.
Why?
Because I reduced the door-to-balloon heart attack standard from 90 to 45 minutes... and I'm very photogenic.
Shoot me talking to her.
Oh, no.
Aw, come on.
You're pretty.
You're crazy.
It'd be a great way for the audience to meet me.
I, uh--no.
All right, listen.
If the suits try to come down on you for last night, whatever you do, don't let
'em take away your anger.
I'm really not that angry.
I'm just a kook who gets annoyed by mothers pimping out their children.
No, anger is good.
Anger in all of its form has marked the upward surge of mankind.
And anger, mark my words, will save not only
Mercy Hospital nut that other malfunctioning organism, you.
What?
Wall Street.
What do you want?
With the camera here,
I was hoping maybe you could, you know, take a swing at me.
I need a little help here, someone!
Oh. Oh!
I like her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay.
Let's not fall asleep here, sir.
Under the arm.
Use your back.
All right.
Ooh.
So...
Okay.
The board and legal are meeting later to discuss the incident.
I wish everyone was as tired of talking about this as I am.
You're on light clinical duty.
If you say what you're thinking,
I'll have you doing quality assurance chart reviews.
Big guy goes in 510.
Let's get him back to bed.
Hey, thanks for your help.
I have to say I feel a little responsible for your predicament.
Why?
Because...
I'm the one who thought jumping back into work after the shooting would be good for you.
It was a horrible, shocking situation...
And I lost it.
All right.
Call this ptsd specialist.
If I can tell the brass you're seeking help, it might make you look better.
Don't kid yourself.
Forget about losing the job.
If that piece of trash presses charges, you could go to jail.
Call the head-shrinker.
Seriously, the woman looked like she'd been attacked by a bear.
God. You're kidding.
That is rough.
Hey.
What are y'all doing in the nurses' lounge?
We're just hearing about last night.
Yeah, what happened last night?
Veronica didn't tell you?
Didn't tell me what?
Uh, well, let's just say that your girlfriend has got a bit of a short fuse.
Don't eat the last pop tart.
I didn't really break my hip, did I?
No, you have a hairline pubic ramus fracture.
Do you see this little bone here?
It's the least serious kind of pelvic fracture.
It usually takes four to six weeks to heal properly.
The Boston Marathon is in 33 days and I'm going to break
3 1/2 hours or I'll be laughed out of my own office.
Well, I wouldn't book a plane ticket.
I can't guarantee you'll be ready.
Yeah, I want to take him to an optimists anonymous meeting.
You are too positive for your own good.
You're not the first person to say that.
So look, Brooke, your EKG and chest X-ray are basically normal, so your heart and lungs are okay.
Still a little tachycardic.
Your heart's beating a little fast from dehydration.
Which is why you can't go home.
You have to work with this pill every day?
Yep.
Are you a runner?
You look like a runner.
No, I'm not.
I'm not a runner.
I mean, I run sometimes.
How is the dizziness?
All right, I guess.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
You were hit by a car three days ago.
Why didn't you come in then?
I was grazed.
You must have a pretty high pain threshold.
Pain is in the mind.
What is in this bag?
Sterile water with salt and sugar.
Really?
I've been off sugar for six months.
Is this absolutely necessary?
Yeah.
Did you see the lanugo on her arms?
Exercise freak all concerned about the dextrose in her iv.
That's anorexia.
Yeah, I'll order a psych consult.
Look, Dan, I lost it.
Can we please just move past this?
No.
We can't move past this.
You're dangerous.
You're reckless.
You refuse to acknowledge your behavior or take care of yourself.
Okay.
So now we're gonna go back to hating each other?
No, Veronica.
I'm just gonna go back to work.
I checked your X-ray, and they call this a boxer's fracture.
It's a break of the fifth metacarpal, which is the bone between the big knuckle and the wrist.
Yeah, so stop hitting people.
Yeah, I've been telling him that for years.
Let's go, let's go, quick.
Is this really necessary?
Heard there was some action down here.
Uh, just a st. Paddy's day brawl.
Some broken bones and split lips.
Sorry.
Hey, Bob, Larry, look at this.
Must be some reality show or something.
All right, here we go.
Hi.
Yeah.
Ow!
It's just a shot, you baby.
You're freaking orange.
Why do you paint your body anyway?
Shut up, you polka-dotted bitch.
What'd you just call me?
Can you get the cameras out of here?
It's like catnip for morons.
You're much too close to me.
You hear that?
She's talking about you, guido.
What'd you say, bro?
Larry...
Eat me, juicehead!
Bring it, you little ginger prince.
Larry?
Come on.
Boot and rally, Larry.
Larry?
Larry?
Pulse is weak and thready.
Come around.
I need a liter of saline.
Tombstones on the monitor.
St segment elevation.
He's having a heart attack.
What? Oh, my God!
How does a kid his age have an mi?
Cocaine. Anyone?
Oh, my God.
On my count.
One, two, three.
All right, clock is ticking, people.
Fasten your seatbelts.
It's about to get real.
Hey.
Hi.
Do you want to come down to radiology with me?
I want to put your head under an X-ray.
Find out what the hell's going on in there.
Oh, you heard about the thing.
Yeah. I heard about the thing, yeah.
Just now from a whole bunch of people who weren't you.
I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.
Sure you were.
Well, I--
We were just so happy and cozy last night.
I didn't want to ruin the mood.
Oh, so you'd rather just drink a bottle of wine,
Scarf down some beef wellington,
And not mention anything?
Yeah.
That is so weird.
Is it?
Honey, it's two blocks past weird.
If I gave you
$1 million, would you call the therapist?
How do you know about the therapist?
Am I the only one around here who can keep my mouth shut?
Veronica, let's get some dinner tonight
And just talk about what's going on.
Please make the call.
Okay, fine.
Fine.
Oh, crap!
It's St. Patrick's Day.
So?
Veronica Agnes
Flanagan Callahan?
You can't actually get more
Irish than that without being a leprechaun.
Don't leprechauns eat?
It's just, my family, we go to this street festival every year.
It's tradition.
Okay, wait.
I got it.
I'll do a quick drive-by, say "hi" to the fam,
Check in with my heritage, and then fully engage in some intimacy with you.
How does that sound?
Sounds like a plan.
Good.
Guide catheters in position.
Give me a puff.
What are we looking at,
Dr. Briggs?
Clot in the L.A.D.
I call this "the widow maker."
The main vessel which carries oxygen to the heart is completely clotted off.
Excuse me.
I've got ectopy on the monitor.
Dr. Briggs, do you want me to draw up some lidocaine?
No, I'm about to fix all that... by passing a thin metal wire through the clot.
Is he awake?
No, he's deeply sedated.
Kind of like your crew.
Sorry, dude.
Another mig of versed?
Yeah, go for it.
42 minutes since he collapsed.
Dr. Briggs, you promised us 45.
Yes, I did.
Let's try something else.
Let's try the Fishbein view.
Right.
Got it.
Okay, here we go.
Wire passing.
Excellent.
I'm passing a balloon catheter with a collapsed wire stent on it.
It'll crush the clot, deploy the stent, and keep the artery wide open.
Perfect.
Wow.
44 minutes. Not bad.
You guys can take a break, grab some lunch.
You can talk to Larry when he wakes up in recovery.
Thanks.
We got some great stuff.
I'll get his vitals.
With increased contractility, his pressure should be up.
All right, let's go.
I need an intra-aortic pump now!
Give me a short soft-tipped oh-one-four wire and intravascular ultrasound.
Why? We're done.
Yeah, no, we're not.
Let's go.
The clot is progressing.
But you opened the artery.
No, that was video playback from last week.
Milton Fishbein's cath.
Oh, God, Payne, don't give me the bible-y eyes.
Run of eight.
300 amiodarone.
Glove up and prep the left groin, Chloe.
Veronica, come see this.
Whoa, Brooke.
What are you doing?
Just getting a little exercise, so when I want to go to Costa Rica over Easter, my boyfriend does not throw up when he sees my legs.
Okay, then let's wrap this up.
Ugh!
Just calm down.
I'm almost done.
Just five more minutes.
Oh, my God.
No, this is not a discussion.
I want you to get back in bed before you--
Ahh!
Go get some help.
My leg. I can't--
I can't move it!
Keep still.
We're going to take care of you.
What is this, a cement clot?
You could have asked them to leave.
You didn't have to fake a whole show.
I had to get them out of the room.
They were slowing us down.
Looks like the wire passed.
Don't take the bait.
We could be subintimal.
Volcano cath.
I'm trying to put some polish on this dingy little flop house.
Polish?
Thought it was about medicine.
That's adorable.
It's about pr.
Had to make it look effortless so that when people see us
On TV, they think,
"hey, you know,
"I need a cutting-edge heart procedure.
"maybe I should jump in my Range Rover
"with my big bag of money and drive over the river to Mercy."
Damn, it's all thrombus.
V-tach.
200 joules now.
I got it.
No.
I want you to stay with me on this side of the table.
Clear.
Sinus.
Amio at 70 a minute.
Okay, Chloe,
I want you to advance my catheter one inch.
Me?
Wha--are you sure?
All you have to do is push.
I'm sure you've heard this before... but be gentle.
There we go.
Feel a little resistance?
That's okay.
Steady.
I'm feeling it.
Uh-huh.
I think it moved.
You just pushed a catheter through a blood clot to save a man's life.
Ready to inflate.
That was incredible.
Okay.
Let's wrap this up.
Deflate the catheter.
Cycle the dynamap, send a troponin now,
And q six hours.
I'll take the ivus again.
Oh, I'm gonna get--
Whoo!
So how'd it go with Klowden today?
She wants me to see a therapist and I'm on probation, but I figure I keep my act together and I'll be fine.
Ah-ha-ha!
I'll be fine.
Okay, so did you put in an early warning system for those emotional tsunamis that you're prone to?
Ooh, ouch.
What do you mean,
"emotional tsunamis"?
You have to ask?
Does this mean you're gonna be on my ass too?
Because my ass is totally crowded.
There is no room for you on my ass.
Last place I want to be.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
You working?
No, just meeting some buddies.
Everything good?
Yeah, great.
Listen,
I actually gotta run.
Yeah, no, me too.
All right.
Yeah.
Bye.
How did that go?
It sucked.
And life's a bitch.
So am I.
I really burned that bridge.
Hmm, you just made a mistake.
Granted, it was a naked mistake.
You just have to impress upon him that nakedness is a two-way street.
Ooh, I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm drunk.
You made it through your first run-in.
Have a bear.
Well done.
You did good.
I did.
Hey, Ronnie!
Hey, dad.
Happy St. Pat's!
Thanks, dad.
Oh, happy St. Pat's, honey.
Oh, my God.
What's up, Flanagans?
You guys getting into trouble?
Nah, just the usual.
They're playing ring around the shamrock down the block.
You want in?
Oh, I don't even know what that is.
It's free beer.
Come on.
Okay.
Hey, Ronnie.
Ronnie, come on, dance with me.
Come on.
Dance with me, honey.
I just came to say hi.
No, I can't.
I have to meet Chris.
What? Boo!
Invite your boyfriend down here to celebrate.
Huh, what is he, afraid to have a few beers on St. Paddy's Day?
Hey, hey, hey, ignore them.
Say no to drunken debauchery and yes to your relationship.
Oh, that is so weak.
He doesn't want to have a drink on St. Patrick's Day?
What is he, racist?
We're supposed to talk.
Well, that's what you get for dating a guy who's not Irish.
Your wife is Jewish, Tim.
Let's go inside.
I'm freezing my pills off.
Tell your lame-ass boyfriend to come down here.
It's fun.
Come on. Come on!
Come on!
Hey, I'm leaving in a bit.
Where do you want to grab dinner?
Actually can you come meet me here?
My family wants to hang out with you.
No, they don't.
They hate me.
No, they don't hate you.
Your brothers literally tried to kick my ass.
Okay, well,
St. Paddy's Day loophole.
For these 24 hours, all non-irish men fornicating with Irish daughters are forgiven.
Please just come down here and have a beer and then we can go get dinner someplace and talk.
Put some green on and get your pale ass down here now!
You--I--
Hey, man!
Here. Catch up.
Check it.
Flanagans versus the Doherty family.
Bunch of poseurs.
Come on, Ronnie!
Kill!
Ah!
Yes!
Hi! Hey!
Oh, you made it.
Uh, hey, happy St. Patrick's day, Mr. Flanagan.
Yeah, let me get a drink and I'll come back and tell you all about how the Irish saved civilization.
I'm glad you came.
Where's Sonia and Chloe?
Sonia went home.
Bobby's been chasing
Chloe around like a little puppy somewhere.
I don't know.
You having fun?
Yeah, I am.
Yeah.
I didn't call that therapist today.
But I'm gonna do it tomorrow.
Okay, great.
Listen, I need to catch up.
You got to give me a shot.
Mm-hmm!
Oh, my God!
Pat O'Donnell's doing the beer-drinking contest!
Ooh, I'll be right back.
Yes!
Hey, Mike.
Hey.
Hey, happy saint, uh-- yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, um, tequila.
The good stuff.
All right, contestants, get ready.
Grab your beer.
I got this.
Don't mess with me.
I will take you down.
I will crush you.
You need a head start, little girl?
Not from you, lightweight.
So Veronica seems great.
She's an example of moderate appetites.
Looks like your love just healed her right up, big fella.
Two, three, drink!
You should bottle that love, since it cures mental problems.
I mean, at first,
I was skeptical, but I am a believer now.
I get your point.
Thank you, Mike.
Loser!
Yes.
Whoo!
Yeah!
Hey, watch out!
Yo, your arm! Your arm!
You're on fire!
Here.
Put your girlfriend out.
She's on fire.
Totally cool.
I'm okay.
I'm worried about my girl.
Thanks for coming over, guys.
I'm really worried.
She's not herself.
She's drinking a lot.
I see that now that I'm at the bar all the time.
It's the perfect storm with the ptsd and the donut shop and your illness, Jim.
Yeah.
Talking about your sister.
She's gonna love that.
Why didn't you come home last night?
You're a grown man sleeping at your mom's house.
What's all this about?
Why are you guys sitting around in a circle?
I only drink socially!
Come on.
We're talking about Ronnie.
Can anyone tell me what I'm doing here?
Hey, Chloe.
How you feeling?
You sleep okay?
Oh, God.
You want a cup of coffee, sweetheart?
Where is Veronica anyway?
She's at my house.
She got really wasted, so she'll be in bed for hours.
Mom!
Mom, have you seen my--
The--
What's going on?
Is this an intervention?
What? No, no.
It's not an intervention.
You're all sitting in a circle.
You're looking at me.
This is an intervention.
Hey, defensive, circle doesn't mean intervention.
Circles happen for plenty of other reasons.
Like that dance at Jewish weddings.
What's it called, Heather?
The hora.
But since you're here,
Veronica... look, we're all just a little concerned about you.
Since when do you two even talk to each other anyway?
Should I get some beers, anybody?
A little hair of the dog.
This is kind of Ronnie's thing.
Uh, what do you want beverage-wise?
Guys, guys, can we not do the refreshments?
Excuse me.
Does anyone know where my clothes are?
Okay, I'll start.
What's really tough fo is having to sit here and look at poor Mike in the co-pilot seat while Dr. Big stuff here drives the boat.
Okay, what the hell did she actually do that was so terrible?
She shot an armed robber.
She beat up some skel who pimped out her kid.
Thank you, Heather.
It's not those things.
It's how you're dealing with them.
But while we're here, can we shed some light on something that is serious like, say,
Timmy's porn addiction?
Oh!
Whew!
What the hell are you doing on my computer?
Dude, you got to erase the history.
He is a chronic masturbator and it is ruining our marriage.
Well, I have got to have sex with somebody, Heather.
You have to have sex with somebody?
Did I or did I not have blackout sex with Bobby Flanagan or any other
Flanagan last night?
No, nothing happened.
I made a little pillow barricade.
God.
Hey, guys. What's up?
What's everybody--
Whoa!
No, I do not have a problem, okay?
Dude, dude, what the hell happened to you?
This is ridiculous.
Ronnie?
Ronnie, please.
Listen to me.
Your mother and I--
Your mother and
I had three boys and then we had you.
Oh, your mother was so happy and I--
I was so scared.
But the minute I saw you, you were my little princess. and I tried so hard to never let anything bad happen to you.
And it's been so rough for you, sweetie.
Dad--
You walk around late at night.
You jump when I say your name.
You're drinking too damn much.
You're at sea.
Don't say you're not.
I'd give everything I got to take the load off your shoulder, but I can't.
I don't know how to help you.
And, um...
It's breaking my heart.
I gotta go to work.
Hey, Veronica.
Hi, Dr. Waters.
Just talked to Brooke Sullivan.
Stairmaster?
How's she doing?
Well, she doesn't meet criteria for a psych hold.
Not that that matters,
'cause she ain't going anywhere.
I offered her voluntary inpatient treatment.
She refused, but she did sign a contract with me to eat more and have outpatient therapy.
I gave her my opinion.
It's probably 1 of 100 that she's heard in the past few years.
We'll see.
You sound cynical.
Well, you're the one that called her "stairmaster."
You know, these people are pretty good at telling you what you want to hear.
I know you probably can't handle another person coming in here and getting in your face with the truth, so I'm not gonna do that.
Maybe some of us are always gonna be a little too little or a little too much.
And I'm not gonna tell you
I'm not worried about you.
I hope you start to take care of yourself.
But right now, I'm just here to be your nurse.
So how's your pain?
You're eating.
That's great.
I was hungry.
Good.
Plus I just got dumped.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He said he couldn't deal with the drama anymore.
I was a fat kid, you know.
I mean, I've been on and off antidepressants since I was ten.
And I guess I'm just a little obsessed with not going back to that.
Anyway, I'm gonna try.
Eat a little more.
Moderate the exercise.
See if I can find a little-- balance.
Right.
Hello, Brooke.
This is Dr. Sands.
Hi.
He's going to talk to you about your hip.
So, Brooke, when you fell, the ball of the joint blasted through the socket.
It's called an acetabular fracture.
The socket fractured into multiple pieces.
Multiple?
At least ten.
We're going to have to operate to put the pieces back together using plates, screws, wire.
Okay, how soon can we do it?
Well, you're too anemic for surgery now.
You'll need two blood transfusions.
It's gonna be a little rough, Brooke.
You're gonna be three months on crutches.
And if all goes well, you can be active again after a year.
A year?
Okay.
I can do that.
So he ignores me all through high school.
They always do.
Right?
So then the year after graduation,
I was getting a slurpee at the "sevs" in that mini-mall with the Hilfiger Outlet and he sees me with these.
He still didn't ask me out, but now I'm on his radar.
Hey, babe.
How are you?
Come on, you were always on my radar.
All right, the blips, now they just got a little bigger, you know what I mean?
All right, how we doing in here?
So anyways, like, a week later at the club, he accidentally shoved me down the stairs.
But I was okay except for a concussion.
But that was it.
I've been taking care of him ever since.
Sounds just like The Notebook.
All right, femoral site looks good.
No hematoma.
Yeah, it's itching like crazy, doc.
Did you really have to shave me?
You should be grateful,
Lar.
You had 13 days sober under your belt and you let that bitch Gina give you blow?
Um, Lar?
Oh, my God.
Systolic's 80.
Excuse me.
Saline on a pressure bag.
Show me the 12-lead.
I need ultrasound in here now.
Larry? Larry?
What's going on?
Is having another heart attack?
Did he clot off his stent?
No, heart's completely normal.
It's something else.
Decreased bowel sounds.
Let's go.
Jelly on the belly.
Come on.
Do you want dopamine?
No.
I want two units of blood from the bank.
He's bleeding like crazy from his liver.
Oh, my God.
Did we nick it with the catheter?
No, it was nowhere near the liver.
Could be cysts.
Barb, is he a juicer?
'cause I'm thinking steroid use here, am I right?
Tell him, Barb!
Yeah.
Put him in trendelenburg.
Hold an O.R. and page Sands.
So I've never seen a case of peliosis hepatis before.
Yeah, it's spontaneous hemorrhaging from blood-filled cysts in the liver.
And it's associated with anabolic steroid use?
Definitely.
Hey, slasher?
Make sure this kid lives, okay?
I'm batting a thousand here at Mercy,
So don't ruin my average.
What an ass.
Good in bed though.
What are you doing here?
I knew you'd be having lunch here.
Do you have a sec?
Give me a sec, guys.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Except seeing you last night kind of killed me.
I miss you so much, Nick.
Sonia, come on.
Do you know that
I would give anything to go back and have dinner with you on Valentine's Day?
I'm so sorry.
I was scared and stupid and selfish... and I lost the best thing that ever happened to me.
Come on.
I have to know.
Would you ever consider getting back together?
Sone...
I appreciate everything you just said.
Really.
And I know how hard it was for you to say it,
But I can't.
I'm sorry.
Well, hey, can't we just get a drink and talk about it?
Took care of the check,
Nick.
Let's go chase some bad guys.
I got a new partner and new shifts.
Hey, change can be good, right?
I'll see you.
Hey.
Great news.
Larry made it through surgery without a hitch.
Sands fixed his liver and those hemorrhagic cysts will go away as long as he stays away from the steroids.
Right there.
Right... there.
How many times are you gonna do that?
Until I catch all my mistakes.
What mistakes?
You fixed that guy in, like,
75 minutes.
That's--that's way faster than the national standard.
My father died of an mi in the waiting room of a mediocre hospital.
He was a good guy.
Made me want to revolutionize cardiac care and what happened yesterday was not revolutionary, Chloe.
I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
It's not your fault.
Obviously I'm not responsible for your father's death.
I was just saying
I'm sorry for your loss.
Well, as fascinating as your feelings about my losses are,
I really need to figure out what the hell took so long, so if you don't mind.
Not at all.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry about that accidental intervention today.
That was a train wreck.
No, I get it.
Things have been a little rough lately.
I can see where you might be concerned.
I love you.
I was just worried about you, that's all.
I love you too.
I guess I just feel like if we're together, everything's going to be okay.
Well, we were together last night and you set yourself on fire.
Yeah.
Well, it's not
St. Patrick's Day till somebody lights themselves on fire, right?
I guess so.
Does it have to be you?
Never again. I swear.
See you at my place later?
Yeah.
Hey, could you give these to Brooke Sullivan?
It's info on support groups in the area.
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Help me get this door open.
Brooke?
Oh, my God.
Help! Brooke!
Brooke? Help!
Help!
I need some help in here!
Help me cut her down!
How the hell did she do that?
Call for intubation!
She was in traction.
She's setting well at 50% oxygen.
Good.
No spontaneous eye-opening,
But she does withdraw to painful stimuli.
That's encouraging.
Well, we'll have to wait and see how much neurological function returns.
I thought she was okay.
She told me she was gonna try.
Yeah.
It's really frustrating.
Hi.
Hi.
What can I get for you?
Scotch on the rocks.
Please.
Sure.
There you are.
Thank you.
Let's see what we have here.
Okay, wound is clean and dry.
Xeroform and a fresh abd.
Larry, I was so worried about you.
How are you feeling?
I'm a little muffed up from the pain medication,
But I'm okay.
I'm so sorry, Larry.
I never should have let you take all those steroids.
No, that's not your job, okay?
I gotta make some lifestyle changes.
I know.
Listen, Lar.
You don't need to be all juiced up for me.
I mean, I love the fact that I can put my arms all the way around you.
Oh, baby, you're so good to me.
Well, you're my flower.
Your what?
My flower.
See, I was watching
Dr. Phil before and he says that in every relationship, there's a flower and there's a gardener.
And you're my flower.
Oh, baby, come here.
And I'm your gardener.
Come here. Come here.
Mm.
So you and Briggs, huh?
That's none of your business.
I'm over us okay, Chris?
Gillian, wait.
I know, but--
Look, I'm sorry about the way everything went down.
Yeah, well, you should be.
'cause with me, you would have been the flower, and now you're the gardener and you have a lot of weeds to pull.
Here you are.
Thanks.
What are you drinking?
Scotch.
I really got to switch to that color.
Why is that?
This is what my parents drank and they're alcoholics.
Help you sleep at night?
Yeah.
I get it.
What keeps you awake?
This, you know?
I can't--
I can't turn it off.
Same stuff over and over.
What kind of stuff?
You ask a lot of questions, lady.
You don't want to talk about it?
God, everyone in my life just keeps wanting me to talk about everything, but they really don't want to know.
Trust me.
'cause if you told them, they'll think you're crazy?
Everybody already thinks
I'm crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
Maybe.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking that I just want everybody to shut up and leave me alone.
I just want to be left alone.
But not?
Right?
But not.
Because when I'm alone, it's worse.
Welcome to the human race.
It's been great talking to you, Veronica.
I'm really glad you called.
But next time, let's meet in my office, okay?

I did not fly all the way from New York City... to wherever the fuck we are to get on that.
How many vacations have you enjoyed?
You wanted to try something new.
Tell me, how new does that look?
It's got a fucking chimney, Anthony.
It's a funnel. Honey, we're here now.
Let's just try and enjoy it.
I only agreed to this if it had a fully-equipped gym.
They do.
That I was assured of.
Welcome aboard, professor.
- I'm not actually a professor.
That's not what I hear.
Thank you very much.
I'm your captain. Call me captain.
- You're a real captain, captain?
Madam?
I'm not interested in shaking
Blackbeard's hook.
Would you show my wife to her quarters, please?
Of course, professor.
What's with the finger snapping?
- Don't get all ltalian on me, Peppe.
I don't like finger snapping.
The clients expect finger snapping from the captain.
Giuseppe will show you to your room.
This is your cabin, sir. Madam.
What you can't fit, keep in my room.
- We'll make do. Thanks.
That should be all.
My name is Giuseppe. Peppe for short.
I am the fisherman, but if you need anything, I'm your man.
Ask him about the gym.
Would you show my wife the gym, please?
- Certainly.
What was that screaming about?
What happened?
- She's crazy.
What was that screaming?
- Wait here.
I thought she would like me bringing the gym to her.
I wasn't very happy. What kind of a gym could you possibly carry?
Then what?
- I showed her the gym.
He showed me the gym.
- And?
And?
Your gym. She started screaming.
- I was understanding.
Anthony!
So then... that little hairy black one pulled out a rope... and told me I could jump over it.
- For jumping.
Jump, jump.
She said she was going to hang you with it, captain.
Me?
This is a good idea.
A trip from ltaly to Greece.
It's Greece to ltaly, babe.
Have you seen the deserted islands we can visit?
You cannot do that in the Caribbean.
What would you do on a deserted island, Debi?
I'll think of something.
What?
What "what"?
What is it that you're going to think of?
You lost me.
And here he is.
Nice outfit, pal. Very native.
- Thanks.
What have you come as? Popeye?
- There's no need for that, darling.
I like this outfit. Very Errol Flynn.
- Very Errol Flynn.
Who's Errol Flynn?
I thought we agreed to get dressed up for dinner.
You put us on a boat built for pirates, can we not dress like one?
I changed my mind. I wanted to be a little more comfortable.
Where does that leave me?
And our guests?
Where would we all be if we just did things because we felt like it?
On vacation?
She's a piece of work, that woman.
Why speak Greek? I look Greek?
- You look like an idiot.
Tony's not had much holidays.
- Look after that fucking woman.
Watch your mouth.
Remember what you're getting paid.
It was you that asked me to help you.
I can live without money.
I was happy as I was.
Happy? Happy is nice.
But how much does happy pay?
Now you're talking.
It's not going to rain, madam.
Is that a joke?
Come on in. It's clean as a whistle.
- Depends on who's been blowing it.
Don't bother coming in.
It's really wet. Where's Debi?
Maybe she drowned.
- Did anyone ask if she could swim?
Salty!
Put a mask on and swim with the fishes.
You'll enjoy it.
Why?
Because it's nice.
When you have some time off,
I suggest you swim with the fishes.
Fish is the plural for fish.
Do something about Marina and Amber.
They're ripping Debi to shreds.
What can I do? You know what they're like.
Besides, she's not the sharpest... quickest....
She's stupid, isn't she, Todd?
- Well, she's....
She's unaware of what they're doing.
- Be nice, Tony. She's only 14.
Don't give me that white liberal shit.
It's the nature of capitalism.
Don't give me that white liberal shit.
It's the nature of capitalism.
It's more successful than communism.
You don't see people emigrating to Cuba.
There are problems raised by capitalism.
- What problems?
Your old man's the boss of a pharmaceutical company.
He's got to make a profit to keep the shareholders happy.
That's not in the public's best interest.
- Then they don't have to buy. lmagine there's a drug that can cure a certain kind of blindness.
Even though it costs nothing to make it... they still put a high price on it.
Capitalism.
So if you can't afford the drug, you'll stay blind.
Without the drug companies, they'd stay blind.
What's to stop them getting a job and buying the drug?
They're blind.
- So what?
Limits their employment opportunities.
- They can bake cakes.
You don't need eyes to bake cakes.
But it does raise an ethical question.
- The laws of capitalism are:
The proprietor of goods can set any price he sees fit... and shall not be at the mercy of any moral or ethical issues.
Whose quote is that?
Mine.
I can't see you baking too many cakes.
She's without a heartbeat.
She's a lizard.
Stop moaning.
You're not married to her.
A lizard. One that should be made into a bag, belt and boots!
Guido!
Peppe?
Yes, sir?
- Sir is madam. Water and towel.
Yes, madam.
- And Pee Pee, I want it cold.
Understand? Not cool.
Cold.
As cold as the blood in your veins.
I'm bored.
- I know it. What are we gonna do?
Just have a martini, pop a pill and fuck my husband.
Everyone else does.
Have you no dignity?
What's that?
What?
- That.
It's a jug.
- It's a coffeepot, actually.
What's in the coffeepot, Pee Pee?
Coffee, madam.
- Reheated coffee?
Yes.
- What am I supposed to do with that?
Drink it?
It's not his fault.
- Whose fault is it then, Todd?
Who's paying whom to do what around here?
Say something, Anthony.
- Would you accommodate my wife, please?
Accommodate? Does this mean live in my cabin, sir?
Is this what you mean?
- I think that was a joke.
He's being rude, Anthony.
- Let me deal with this.
Would you please make my wife a fresh pot of coffee, Mr. Esposito?
Certainly, professor.
I'm going to kill that fucking bitch with a kitchen knife!
You surprise me. You told me that a real man's duty is to preserve his dignity.
That's why I'm going to kill the fucking bitch with a kitchen knife!
If she's so much of a problem, stay away from her.
Easy for you to say!
She's not hunting you down.
Everywhere I turn, there she is!
I feel like... a lame gazelle stalked by the eyes of an angry leopard!
Very theatrical.
Now, clean the boiler.
The advantages of chemicals are all around us.
Do we have to listen to that again?
We were playing for $20, and now... it's 4000?
- You don't think I'm good for it?
Can't you control your wife?
- Can't you control yours?
It's changed the atmosphere.
- You're Mr. Moneybags.
I am on vacation.
Stop being such a pussy, Michael.
If you haven't got money,
I'll take jewellery and shoes.
I fold. I have no interest in playing
"get fucked quick" with Imelda Marcos here.
Guido!
When you've put that reptile down, can you empty the ashtrays?
Thank you.
- So go on. Chemicals. Advantages.
Where would we be without fertilizers and pesticides?
Ask Peppe. He was a fisherman until pollution put an end to that.
Pollution is so terrible.
- God. This isn't a sad story, is it?
Ask him what he thinks.
- Nothing wrong with chemicals.
What do you think about pesticides?
- Whatever.
Let him get on with his job.
- Come on. You gotta have an opinion.
If it's man-made, I don't trust it.
You can't cut corners with nature.
Chemicals has made life easier, but easier doesn't mean better.
Money corrupts principles. You can't see clearly when money is involved.
Not money and principles.
Now, this is interesting. Go on.
Chemicals has made a few people very rich.
But as they say, no such thing as a free lunch. Pay now or pay later.
When you pay later, you don't know the interest charged... and who's gonna pay it.
Very good.
- Yes, very good.
Thank you, nature boy. Now, could you please empty the ashtray?
If it weren't so hot, I'd go swimming.
- You wouldn't. The water would be too cold.
I can't eat this.
- What's wrong with it?
Nature boy!
You! Pee Pee!
Yes, madam?
- This fish is bad. It's off.
Bad?
In that case, if you don't want to eat it, you probably want to wear it!
Now it doesn't look so bad, madam.
You blinded me!
- Now you can bake the cakes.
Anthony! Help me!
- Sit down, rich boy... or you'll need all the drugs you got to ease the pain I have for you.
Shut up! Tell it to the fishes.
- Help me!
Now Peppe is in charge.
You listening to me, nature boy?
Yes.
- Why are you serving bad fish?
She needs a doctor!
A checkup from the neck up!
Shut up and take this.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
You made it bad.
You take it up!
What did you say?
- You take it up!
No. The other bit. The bad bit.
What did she say? In English.
- She said the fishes is bad.
Bad?
Tastes okay.
- Of course.
Never mind. Cook another one.
Why?
- Because they're rich... and all rich people are the same.
They play little games. I see it all the time.
Don't react. They get bored, and they change the game.
Our job is to smile.... Like idiots.
The chef is sorry the fishes wasn't so good. He's cooking new fishes.
Are we being punished because we're rich?
No, madam. I love money.
If you weren't rich, you wouldn't be here.
No punishment here.
We love you.
And we love your money more.
That's it, Greek idiot.
Smile.
Happy birthday, Mrs. Marina.
You look gorgeous.
It's always good to see you.
- The pleasure is all mine.
Professor, welcome back.
- I'm not a professor.
Of course you are.
Did you have a good time?
Let me help you.
- Thank you.
Are those ruins old?
- Yes.
All right. I've got it.
All right. I've got it.
Did you have a nice day?
- Yes, I did. Thank you.
I bought some fresh fish.
Peppe always catches the fishes for us.
- I don't care about Giuseppe's fish!
What she said? What's the fucking bitch complaining about now?
Did one of your crew members just swear in front of me?
No, no. You mean "fuking"?
This is the ltalian name of the fishes.
He doesn't think it's very good.
"Fuking" is a fish?
- Yes.
I don't care if it's fuking, puking or a fucking kung fu king!
I want that fish, and I want it tonight.
Okay, madam.
- Thank you.
Fucking, puking, fucking good cooking
I want her on my table tonight
Shut up, idiot.
I can't cook that.
These fishes are beneath me.
This is fishes?
Where did you get...?
Cook Peppe's fishes instead... and pretend it's their fishes.
Got that?
Now, that's what I call fish.
- Yes.
Here's to the fishes.
- Hear, hear.
It's really good.
Isn't it, Michael?
Yes, it is. It's delicious.
It's just right. Great job.
- Thank you.
It tastes just like chicken.
We can do without nature boy's fish from now on. I'll be in charge of fish buying.
That's okay, madam.
That's disgusting.
- Really?
I think it's beautiful.
Why are you haunting our corridors with Ms. Beautiful?
The crew still wants my fishes.
I'm taking it to the kitchen.
I hope I haven't hurt your feelings.
- Feelings?
Let us leave my feelings out of this.
- Don't be so touchy.
-Can't we just get along?
-No, madam. We cannot.
I see you have your dancing shoes on.
One, two. One, two, three.
Please, madam.
What's the matter?
Don't you wanna dance with me?
I don't wanna dance with people
I don't like.
Wine.
Grapefruit juice, madam.
- Thank you.
Do you have children, Pee Pee... or just the mind of a child?
What?
- That cartoon you're wearing.
You requested us to change our T-shirts.
You T-shirt offends me. It's revolting.
Change it.
Subtle.
- Shut up, you old drunk.
Going to bed?
I'll be there in a minute.
- Good night.
Aren't you playing?
- Imelda cleaned me out.
I'm coming with you.
We can tuck up together.
Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Like he said.
What are they up to now?
- The husbands went to bed... while the wives stay up playing cards and drinking.
What kind of husbands are they?
They got everything the wrong way around.
Look what the brunette left in the bathroom. I think it's cocaine.
Let me show you how to take it.
Hold on, captain.
I bet it's something the professor made in his lab.
Flies you to the moon in minutes!
- I've never been to the moon.
What's wrong with you?
You're the captain.
How will we make it to ltaly if you go to the moon?
Go to bed! I'll forget you lost control. Go!
Fuck you. We could have gone to the moon and had an orgy.
I don't want to have an orgy with you.
Go to bed, idiot.
You've lost your mind at the thought of taking it.
Rack 'em up, ladies.
I'm out.
I'm going up for air.
Where is everybody?
They went to the caves with the dinghy.
Why didn't they tell me?
- I know why.
Guido. Lower the other one.
I wanna go to the caves.
It's too late.
- I'll be the judge of that.
There is a current, and the weather could changes.
So what?
The caves are not so close.
My advice is to don't go.
Really? My advice to you is to get the fucking dinghy down.
It's all the same to me, but it's getting late... and it's a long journey.
- We'll manage.
I have warned you.
What's the matter? Are you scared?
- Scared?
I was conceived on the crest of a wave and born in a boat.
What is the meaning of "scared"?
Is this another one of your jokes?
Let's start the engine, shall we?
This engine is a little touchy.
- I can show you touchy.
Now, start the engine.
Number one: My name is Peppe.
Not Guido or Pee Pee!
Number two: I can't start an engine that doesn't want to be started.
Can we stick to one language?
I'll take the engine that runs your mouth.
Then we wouldn't have any problems.
Do we have enough gas?
- Yes.
We have... gas.
- We'll just wait, then.
I'm sure they won't be long.
Aren't we going too far out?
- I warned you about the current.
Give me your sweater.
Jesus!
What've you been doing in that?
- I'm a fisherman, and it's my sweater.
I go fishing in it.
So it smells of fishes.
Fascinating.
If they were coming, they would have passed us.
Maybe they decided to go around the island.
It's not funny anymore!
I want to go back to the yacht.
We can't go back just because you want us to.
We must be rescued or fix the engine.
- Fix it, then!
Great.
Look at this mess I'm in.
Why has this happened to me?
Oh, God. Peppe?
Giuseppe?
Mr. Esposito? Mr. Esposito!
You miss me?
I wanted...
I wanted to know if a storm was coming.
I can't see land anymore.
Why haven't they come for me?
The sea is big.
It could take a while.
A while. What's a while?
There must be something in this plastic bath toy.
I can't believe you came out here without a cell phone!
What the fuck is this, Popeye?
A submarine?
Be careful. Don't shoot.
Why do you have a gun?
- It's a flare gun.
A flare gun?
Hiding anything else?
This isn't my boat. Give it to me.
- No.
Where is God when you need him?
What are you doing?
Trying to save us from dying of thirst and hunger.
What?
- Eat it.
Can't you wrap it in rice or something?
Here's a bit of salt.
How is that?
It's disgusting!
Why did you do that?
I could have eaten it myself!
It took me hours to catch!
Calm down.
You're embarrassing yourself.
Besides, fasting is good for you.
It's a spiritual thing.
Spirits?
Are you serious? We're not fasting.
We are fucking starving!
Don't you swear at me.
Oh, my God!
God. Out of my way!
Out of my way!
Come on, shoot! Shoot!
Give it to me.
- I know what I'm doing! Get off me!
At least we won't die of thirst!
- Great. We'll just drown instead!
Land!
Wake up, Guido!
Land! Land!
Paddle! Paddle!
Don't rush. You'll hurt yourself.
Forgive me for being in a rush to get to civilization.
I can't believe I found land.
The adventure is over.
The adventure is just starting for you, my friend!
Wait till my lawyer speaks to your captain.
What's wrong, madam?
We're saved, you should be happy.
"Madam," is it now?
Changed our tune now that we're on land, haven't we?
Wait here while I look around.
- So you can forget about me?
No chance, sailor.
I'm afraid your lawyer will have to wait!
What? I can't hear you!
No lawyers here!
Where there's a phone, there's a lawyer!
No phones either!
Why?
Because we have landed on a deserted island!
Deserted?
Nothing. No lawyers. No phones.
No gyms. Nothing.
That's impossible, you idiot.
It's not 1 492, for God's sake.
Just call me an idiot one more time...
You're wrong!
I am not a child.
If I say it's deserted, it's deserted.
I don't believe you.
- It's a fact.
My ass. Where there is life, there are people.
Not here. There are many little deserted islands around here.
Get up there and check again!
No. I had a good look before.
- It's not your place to argue with me.
You fucked up the engine. Got us lost.
Made me sink the dinghy.
You can't navigate!
Fuck it! I can't reason with a hairy, black midget.
What did you call me?
- Nothing.
I want to know what you said.
- Nothing.
Did you call me a midget?
- No.
So, what did you call me?
I called you a hairy, black midget!
Your tongue has the grace of the gutter.
Watch your mouth!
- You threatening me?
Fucking right. Listen carefully,
Mrs. I-have-a-big-time-drug-baron-husband.
I'm fed up! I do what I like, and you do what you like.
Now, fuck off!
- Oh, boy.
You are gonna regret this.
- Fuck yourself!
Dig a deeper grave!
- Fuck yourself, bitch!
Come on! Give me more! More!
- Slut!
What did you call me?
- A whore, a slut!
You are a mongrel dog!
A hybrid of something dark, disgusting and tiny!
Let the rich bitch look after herself!
Now her mongrel dog leaves her side!
Let the dog leave his mistress!
And watch him get lost.
Could be worse.
Not so smug now, are you?
I'll have you arrested.
By whom? The sand police?
If you keep being so polite, you'll force me to give you all my fishes.
I can see you are a very clever woman.
Is there anything else I can do for you while I'm waiting to get arrested?
Sell me that fish.
- What?
I want that fish.
Fuck off and bother some other poor shipwrecked sailor.
I'll give you $100.
Two hundred.
Okay, I'll give you $500 for just half of the fish.
If you are hungry, bake a cake.
This is my final offer. I'll give you
$1000 and my gold bracelet.
Take it. Okay?
Now, give me some fish.
I'm not interested. There are some things in life that can't be bought.
And this fishes is one of them.
But I'm hurt! And I need to eat!
Ten thousand fucking dollars!
Let me quote the laws of capitalism, madam:
"The proprietor of goods can set any price that he sees fit... and should not be at the mercy of any moral issues."
Give me some fucking fish, you scumbag!
Number one:
Don't ever insult me again.
Number two: I am the boss now.
Number three: If you want food, you earn it.
Number four: You will wash my clothes.
You can't hit a woman, you fucking lunatic!
Don't forget number one!
From now on, "fishes" is the plural for fishes.
If you are back within one hour with my clothes cleaned...
I shall consider fishes for you.
- Can I have something to eat first?
Do you give drugs to the needy before they've paid?
We don't accept credit in this house either.
And number six: Call me Mr. Esposito.
No. Call me master.
Yes, call me master.
Come on!
- Go. Go. Go! Wash!
Where will I find a washing machine on a deserted island?
That's not my problem.
Frightened?
Mr. Esposito, you're completely taking advantage of me.
Of course I am. I'm now the master.
Fucking peasant.
I want you to say, "Thank you, master, for the privilege of washing your clothes."
Thank you... master... for letting me wash your clothes.
Where do you think you're going?
- I need to eat!
Who is this Peppe?
Get in line, woman.
I want this bottle filled with water.
And be quick about it.
What?
- Yes, master.
Bravo.
Where are you going?
Wait! How about an answer?
Please, wait for me!
A roof. Thank God.
And a bed. I'm saved.
What are you doing, Mr. Esposito?
I mean, master.
Please don't leave me outside.
It's cold. I won't survive another night.
I'm not an animal!
What do you want?
Do you want to share my bed?
What kind of person are you?
You wish to corrupt me.
I am the master and you're my slave!
Don't flatter yourself.
- Pigs keep warm with leaves.
Pigs! I would rather fuck a pig than kiss you, monkey boy.
You forget yourself again, woman.
Let the chill of the night wrestle the last of the beast from you.
Wakey, wakey.
I want my room cleaned by the time I return.
By the time I return.
It's still flopping.
Quick, woman!
The fishes are getting away!
I'm trying, master.
- Work harder! Harder!
I'm not a fucking donkey.
Master.
What?
If you're decent to me,
I'll make sure you get rewarded.
Money?
- If you like.
You insult me.
You offer money you didn't work for.
At least a whore works for her bread.
And one other thing.
How do you know they will rescue us?
We might spend years on this island.
I'd kill myself.
- Go ahead.
I can feast on you for a week.
But as long as you breathe, you work.
Go get some wood!
Why do you keep assaulting me?
The party is over.
You wait on me now. Move!
You're hurting me.
- Move.
But first, kiss the master's hand.
- What?
Kiss it. Kiss it!
You will be punished when you disobey.
Like you did to me.
You made me spit blood! Yesterday you still called me disgusting names.
Kiss the master's hand.
Kiss it.
Or leave! It's your decision.
But if you leave, you leave forever!
Accept my terms or the terms of nature!
Hand! Kiss it!
What are you doing?
- Quick, woman, take this!
Take what?
Don't be an idiot!
Take the octopus.
What are you doing?
Sorry... master.
Your water.
- Why are you sitting down?
Why not? I've worked and I've earned it.
- I want to be waited on.
Did you ever invite me to your table on the boat?
Now it's time to serve me.
This fucking lady. "The juice is warm.
The coffee's old.
The fishes is bad.
I want food, I'm hungry."
Remember the abuse I took from you?
You despise us.
"Sweaty T-shirts, disgusting."
Go on, impress me.
Give me grapefruit juice.
Master, please.
- Grapefruit juice, find me some.
Dance for me.
- What?
I said, dance for me.
- There's no music.
Make some. Sing as well.
You are making me angry. Dance!
Sing.
I don't want to hear the sound of dirty cats in alleys. I want singing!
Master?
Mr. Esposito?
That's enough.
You think I'm staring at your ass?
Big deal. As if I would.
What about when you were sprawled out... with all your tits hanging out?
Yes, I said "tits."
As if we didn't exist. Remember?
Of course you do, dirty slut.
Show me your tits now.
Hear me?
Keep on playing deaf, then.
Are you bashful?
Madam is bashful.
How come you were not embarrassed before? Undress!
Filthy pig!
- You're fighting back at last.
Come here. I'll teach you a lesson.
- Let go of me! Let go!
Help!
- Go on, shout. Shout!
Somebody, help!
- She's crying for help. The idiot!
Who's going to help you, id...?
Run, you little vixen. Run.
You rapist! Get off of me, you pig!
You'll pay for everything.
Get off, you pervert! Get off!
Why should I pay for all of life's injustices?
You're obsessed!
- Obsessed with justice.
You maniac! You sex fiend!
Pervert, get off!
What are you doing?
I'm going to destroy you and make you feel what a real man is like.
You have never known a real man.
I hate you, but I like you.
And you know it.
I liked you on the boat.
Come on, say it.
Admit it, come on.
Say it. Confess your burning desire.
Come on. Come on.
Are you saying yes?
Are you saying yes?
Yes. I'm saying yes.
Well, it's no. Because I'm saying no!
You must fall in love!
Head over heels in love!
You're already my slave.
I want you as my love slave.
You'll crawl and beg for mercy.
You will burn with desire.
With passion, like a sickness!
I'll get under your skin. lnto your head.
Your heart. Your belly.
I'm going to be your God!
Is that clear?
You don't know yet who
Giuseppe Esposito is!
Dear Mrs. Amber, you have never looked so happy on the yacht.
Peppe, why aren't you sleeping?
You must call me master.
Call me master.
I'll call you whatever you want me to call you.
Just let me go back to sleep.
Stop it.
You are getting good at this, my princess.
Good. Harder, harder.
Make it tender.
Good.
Tell me, is life better than this in the city?
Why you are so quiet tonight?
Come here.
How can you be sad when you are so beautiful?
I don't believe you.
You'd rather be with a girl, wouldn't you?
Someone younger.
Someone prettier.
- What is it with women?
Always trying to look younger.
Thinner.
Would you really be interested in me if you had a choice?
You don't compete with 1 8-year-olds.
- Who says?
Society says.
Who's in charge of you?
You think about what others think.
You never enjoy the moment.
I don't want a girl.
I'm a man, and a man wants a woman!
Come here!
That's enough. I have to stop that.
What are you gonna do about it?
I wanna fix it.
You're making a mess.
What?
I don't believe it.
- What is it?
Drink it.
- I'm not drinking that. You drink it.
Know your problem? You never had to work, so you're not grateful.
How would you know?
You know nothing about my life.
When I met you, you were a pain in the ass.
Well, maybe I wasn't happy.
Why not? Apparently you had everything.
Maybe what I wanted wasn't what I needed.
Drink.
Bruce Lee.
Charlie Chaplin.
Jesus Christ.
Good game.
Stupid game.
- Your turn.
How many words?
One word.
Big head.
The pope.
Godfather,
Marlon Brando.
What is wrong with you,
Mr. Esposito?
You should learn to sew instead of talk.
I love you.
Fine words.
What if we hadn't been shipwrecked?
You'd still be rich, unhappy American wife.
I would still be a poor, ltalian, happy fisherman.
That was then. This is now.
Is this a fairy tale?
It happened because we are here.
Endless passion here.
I'd love to see Mrs. Amber strolling down Five Avenue with Mr. Esposito.
Go on, picture it.
How much love can you see in that?
What are you doing? What is this?
It's a refrigerator.
Where did you get it?
- I saw it flying by.
Watch your mouth!
I do the jokes around here.
How did you get it? And no funnies.
I got it with a spear.
It's big.
Hey, listen, I catch the fishes.
You cook them.
Fresh eggs?
Gulls' eggs?
Yep.
It's my job to get these eggs.
What have you done to me?
What you needed doing to you.
Don't you like it?
It's okay.
Okay?
Yeah. It's okay.
Run, my little vixen. Run. Run!
Let's hide.
Don't, Peppe.
- Why not?
You say you love me.
I want the whole truth.
What more proof do you need?
I've never been happier in my life.
We were meant to be together, you said so.
I don't want to go back.
I don't want to be tested.
If you love me, you can love me anywhere. I want to know! I have to!
I want to know if a rich man's wife thinks the same.
What difference does it make where we are? Please, let's stay.
I love you.
I need proof.
Then we can do as you say.
But I need to know you can resist.
- Believe me.
You're all that I want.
You're scared, aren't you?
That's why I need proof.
What did you do for food?
We made do.
Mr. Esposito is very clever.
I have to go.
- No, no. Sit down.
You must have something to drink.
- Yes.
You know, you have been on the news for a month.
Excuse me. I have to go down.
Absolutely.
Your husband is on the radio.
He's on his way.
He's coming in by helicopter to meet us at the nearest port... but he wants to talk to you.
The telephone is upstairs.
I will show you.
Over one month on a deserted island... and she is not bad?
Nothing happened?
What kind of
Sicilian fool are you?
You know the whole world has been talking about this?
Her husband is a very rich man.
He's going to reward you.
You picked the right woman to save...
Have another glass of wine!
Mr. Esposito.
I wanna thank you for saving my wife.
She said you were most decent.
Thank you.
Mr. Esposito?
Mr. Esposito? We're very grateful for your assistance and help.
We've provided a room at our hotel for you to recuperate.
Hey Peppe!
Where have you been?
Got my bag?
Give me a room.
Just a minute.
Mr. Esposito?
There is one other thing.
Perhaps we should sit down?
As a reflection of our appreciation, we would like to offer you this.
Get out and take your bribes with you.
- No, it's not a bribe, Mr. Esposito.
What will this buy me?
Mrs. Leighton?
There is a phone call for you.
I'll wait outside.
Madam.
Yes?
It's me.
Why did you take so long to call?
- I have called.
They didn't tell me.
It doesn't matter now.
It doesn't matter if you fail me, because I love you.
I love you,...
I love you more than
I ever thought was possible,...
I didn't think it came as strong as this.
You are once again in charge.
I am yours,
I always will be.
I love you too, my darling.
I love you more than life.
My husband's coming.
Leave a message for me in reception.
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
At 9 a.m., I shall have a boat waiting for us... at the end of Pier 22.
I miss you so much.
Are you on the night shift?
And the morning.
You must give this to Mrs. Leighton.
The blonde lady.
I know who she is.
Only give it to her if she is alone.
Understand? Alone.
Hide it.
Are there any messages for me?
What are you doing, honey?
Why aren't you dressed?
- I was looking for you.
Well, let's go, shall we?
Any messages for us?
Just this.
It's about the helicopter.
I have to make a call.
You should go back up, get changed....
Can I use your phone?
- Certainly, sir.
Honey. Just give this tip to the bellboy, would you?
Honey. The tip.
Thank you, madam.
I think this is for you, sir.
Who gave you this?
The blonde lady.
Mrs. Leighton.
That can't be true.
Her husband gave it to you.
No sir.
It was the lady.
Where is she?

Hey people!
We are THE robbers.
Get your hands up!
- Don't try anything!
You know us from the news!
With this, we stimulate the economy!
This is an expropriation proceeding!
Bag everything!
Ownership is theft!
Here you go!
Hands up again!
Down with capitalism!
Stop them!
Come in, Granny!
There's a robbery in progress.
- Ah?
Spare a buck?
Have a long life!
Good luck!
(Rita:)
Those were the happy years.
We thought we were the best,
Tatjana.
We tried to abolish injustice as well as the government.
Both were connected.
Politics were war, throughout the world.
She has a .32 Walther.
- How do you know all that?
Get down!
Please open the bag!
I'm passing through in transit.
Open the bag!
Take a seat, please.
Your name is Marianne Berg.
- Yes.
But you are Rita Vogt.
No, Marianne Berg.
I know you are Rita Vogt.
You aren't allowed to enter the country carrying a weapon.
I'm on my way to West Berlin.
You can't pass through either as long as you're armed.
My friends in Beirut recommended Schönefeld.
Sometimes, different people have the same friends.
In case you ever come back here, take this phone number.
I can pass through then?
- As soon as I know.
Friends, too?
I'd just like to know.
My name's Erwin.
Great that you want to help us.
Riding horses, playing tennis or guzzling down salmon doesn't interest me.
Here's your passport.
One has to hate the world's crudeness in order to be able to appreciate it's delicateness.
I only had a crush.
- On Andi?
Can you handle it?
She can hit trees, but only wide ones.
Gruber defends him.
Isn't that the better solution?
No way.
He'd be in prison for 10 more years.
Gruber won't be involved in anything.
I'm here to visit my client, Mr. Klein.
My trainee,
Frau Adebach.
A police officer shoots at someone who's fleeing.
Does he want to kill him, or just thwart the getaway?
A fleeing guy shoots at the police officer.
Does he want to kill him, or just continue his getaway?
What do you think about that?
I'm glad you're trying.
Hello.
- Hello.
I'd like to ask something.
- Please, go ahead.
Last Christmas, general amnesty was granted.
My brother got out then.
Now he's in again.
Will there be another amnesty this Christmas?
I don't want to be rude, but I don't think so.
But it's Christmas.
Andreas Klein.
My name is Gruber.
This is Miss Adebach.
We've got one hour.
Are you insane?
Open up please!
Venceremos!
Where's Friederike?
She didn't make it out.
- Step on it!
This coat is so fucking bright.
Why did you shoot?
- What happened?
Give me your jacket!
Why did you shoot?
Stop your yelling!
Nothing went wrong!
Where are we going?
- Across the border.
Are you crazy?
Berlin, capital of the GDR.
Station Friedrichstraße.
Passengers from West Germany
Counters 1 through 5.
Red cops are cops, too.
A comrade who's name is just Erwin?!
That's probably not even his real name.
In Germany, aggression has always come from the right wing.
But we are also against terrorism from the left.
Terrorism doesn't lead anywhere.
Terrorism scares the public and causes the deployment of defense mechanisms.
Even Lenin knew that already.
His brother was executed a terrorist.
Sit down!
Thanks.
But I sympathize with romantic young people.
We too are romantics.
I am seventy and still dreaming.
Nothing's ever completed.
How can they break a guy out of prison, in broad daylight.
Up to now, we've never known their plans.
But we are supposed to know everything!
You have to look at it that way.
- Yes, Comrade General.
What are you up to?
Trust has to be established through common experiences.
I thought we were barbecuing sausages.
I believe the plane is gone.
Maybe it's a trap?
- He's a fair guy.
(Someone tries to open the door.)
Hello!
So we meet again this soon.
- I didn't see that coming, either.
Your weapons, please.
But we're just passing through!
- That's what I thought, too.
You still need to see a doctor.
I don't have a weapon.
He looked at me.
Everything was clear to him.
- Maybe he isn't hurt that bad.
Can I help?
- But you are our guests!
Does anyone want a "jester"? - I do.
This sausage tastes good.
- Thüringer rib steak sausage.
The beer is Radeberger.
- It's good as well.
A toast to my release from the capitalist pigs' prison.
As a free man, on free ground!
Cheers!
I like this place.
But what are we doing here?
Exchange of thoughts.
Which thought would you like to exchange?
That the revolution marches on diverging paths!
Here, she sits in the office from 8 to 5.
You guys have such a sense for violence.
Here, the government is the organized form of violence.
You can only break laws, we make them!
From the outside, you only see the wall.
You see the wall from the inside, too.
Does the GDR have to extradite criminals who are wanted in West Germany?
Questions of law aren't my expertise.
But East and West Germany aren't exactly pals.
But nothing bad is allowed to happen here!
No actions on GDR territory!
- Noone wants that.
In return, you can pass through.
We independently fight against imperialism.
But we have a common enemy.
- These are difficult subjects.
We frighten the right people.
The counselor died on the scene.
Dr. Gruber hadn't worked on cases concerning terrorism before.
He leaves a wife and two young kids.
The fugitive, Andreas Klein, got a gun through
Gruber's trainee,
Friederike Adebach.
A large-scale manhunt has been initiated.
Apart from Andreas Klein, the following persons are wanted:
Detlev Bergmann.
Joachim Klatte.
Hans Jürgen Dost.
Martina Lubitz.
Rita Vogt.
Rita Vogt can be recognised through a scar on her elbow.
Caution:
These persons are armed.
The perpetrators are likely to still be in West Berlin.
However, the search has been expanded to cover the entire federal territory.
Did you HAVE to shoot?
The counselor grabbed me.
Why does he do something like that?
I can't hit a human being.
Then the cop came and shot.
So I shot.
The counsellor was in the way.
Shouldn't we bail for a while, Andi?
Does imperialism go down by itself?
Does injustice vanish by itself?
I don't want to argue with you,
I want to be with you!
(Heavy breathing sounds from the headphones.)
Well...
Excuse me, comrades.
I'm cracking up, they are screwing.
Here, in the East.
And what are WE doing?
We aren't screwing.
Nice girls.
Plus, they have steady employment.
You won't find something like that over here.
I think all vigour is gone, over here.
(Rita:) We tried to accomplish the impossible, at least once in our lives.
We felt like we were part of the international fight.
And then we experienced how in Beirut a just cause lead to a murderous civil war.
We wanted to bring the war into the metropoles of the world.
There were never ending discussions, successful and failed operations.
Victims on both sides.
A couple of years later, we were in Paris.
And we were stuck.
I know how it's going to end.
We'll go to prison, for ever.
We sit around in these fat rich countries and waste our lives.
And what for? For the poor, somewhere on this world?
Why don't we go to the starving?
The guilty are here.
The state is carried by individuals.
We just say those people should be liable to prosecution.
These are Andi's words.
Everything started with him.
It started with you. You didn't want to ride horses, play tennis and guzzle down salmon.
- And so forth.
Come here!
If they get me, I fear
I could betray you.
Do you see those guys?
They shoot without warning.
You're going insane.
We shoot first.
(Anna:) Under the rule of imperialism, an armed fight out of illegality is the only chance for active critical agitation.
Yea, man or pig.
We need money for our operations.
- A gun will take care of that.
You can block the grate with two beer crates.
We've already done that a couple of time.
That way, you cannot get trapped inside.
Rita had a look around inside.
It's idiotic to rob a bank here.
- Why?
We used to say: Don't worry, this is an anti-capitalistic operation.
How do you say it here?
- Friederike speaks French.
She shall say: We don't steal.
This is the German Revolution.
You can't assault people with a gun all the time.
We do this together, like in the past.
- Count me out.
You have a personal problem.
You degenerate to a private individual and buy a Honda with OUR money.
You defect to the pigs!
You betray me.
You think so?
- Yes.
You're looking for an enemy.
But why me?!
Let Rita be.
You fuck around and wear designer suits.
Dumb pig from the ruling class!
Hey, that's unnecessarily personal!
What are the two of you? Problem or solution? Man or pig?
One thing is obvious:
Fight the pigs to liberate man!
Every armed operation subdues the force of the circumstances to the force of the events.
That better be clear!
Vous roulez sans casques.
- We drive without a helmet.
Excusez-nous! - Vous n'êtes pas d'ici?
Montrez-moi vos papiers!
Run!
Early in the morning, the East is cold.
We've got everything.
Radeberger too.
Gladly. That's what we used to have back then.
What's already good, does not have to be changed.
Some comrades don't want to continue.
We dismounted riders, but not the emperor.
We're in deep shit.
Those comrades cost us money and are unreliable.
I am reliable!
I don't want to sit around and wait.
We were to fight on the world front.
That's what you said.
And, where is the world front?
Somewhere on this world, people like us have to be needed!
Vase.
Angola would be a destination.
Or Mozambique, if that's possible.
You do have connections to there, don't you?
Like this, it already looks a lot brighter.
We have to get out of
France, too.
I know.
To whom did that thing happen, with the cop?
To me.
It happened to me.
You want to quit, too?
- No!
(The men scare up some deer.)
Ten people.
They want to go anywhere, no matter where.
Preferably Angola or Mozambique.
What do they want from us?
We are supposed to get them in and have them accommodated.
People are black there.
As whites, how do they plan on disappearing?
I'll leave that to you.
Let's get back to the issue at hand.
We can't make any mistakes.
That's how I see it, comrade General.
That's how one has to see it.
We talk without any witnesses?
- And off the record.
Were can we sit down and talk?
- Inside.
Let's sit under the tree.
Good idea.
You are wanted world-wide, even the ones who quit.
We wont send any one of you to Africa, not Angola, not Mozambique.
The political situation there is fragile.
Secret agents all over the place.
And the people are black.
You are white.
You can be traced back to us.
We propose a different offer.
Your people can stay here.
In the GDR.
Separated, not in a group.
No contact between each other, or to their former life.
Every single one has to sign on this.
They will get new names and have new identities.
For a long time.
Maybe for ever.
Given that you lead an utterly normal, common life.
The life of the working class, so to speak.
And another thing.
We should have more serious talks than we've had in the past, in regular intervals.
I doubt you tell us all about all of your plans.
You're merely supposed to listen to us, before you scheme anything.
Do we get any military support?
You can go in for sports here.
Is shooting considered sport?
You can see it like that.
The RPG-7 is an anti-armor weapon. Who shoots?
Me.
20 metres safety clearance!
They know the ropes.
They have to have practiced already.
They couldn't make this dog into a fighter.
- What's it doing here?
It's a request of the department for personal security.
We have to do it.
We're driving important people, too.
Is the dog supposed to be in the car?
Every round has to be accounted for.
The department for personal security pays for it.
Fire!
"... the partisans of the Amur."
"That's how we blasted the scum to hell,
General and Ataman."
"Our campaign found it's end only in the Pacific."
These songs were with us.
That's how we started over after the war.
They were always with us.
And rock 'n' roll?
Not so much.
Vodka is the soldier's friend.
Hey, Andi ...
You used to be my ardent love once.
So?
Is this here the life of the working class?
I'd rather drink my beer somewhere else.
Good morning!
Four to Beirut.
For you, for you ... and for you two.
You don't have to pay!
We want to.
One ticket is left over.
Rita!
I find it brave of you to have stayed here.
You are going to see socialism for what it is.
You are going to see that sometimes we have to force people into their luck.
But maybe, you will understand.
We are for the people, therefore we are against them.
And my mother didn't get along with herself.
She didn't have a lot of money.
At age 42, she suddenly died.
I don't understand it.
We now start with your story.
- What's my story?
Your made-up life, which now becomes your real one.
When do you want to have your birthday?
Summer time, when it's warm.
Which name do you want?
Suggestion: Schmidt [Smith, very common name]
Schmidt is retarded.
Different proposal then?
No, Schmidt's fine.
Given name?
You choose.
We are going to make some suggestions for your parents' data soon.
I don't need parents.
- We let them be dead then.
Otherwise, you'll be asked about your parents all the time.
You don't have any anymore.
The truth makes for the best lies.
You know you need to carry your ID at all times.
But you know me.
That's not my job.
Which department?
- Fashion print.
Name? - Susanne Schmidt.
There's an error in the print.
- Yes, exactly.
(Woman:) The fabric print is defective!
- Coming.
Aw, shit!
Shit, man!
Something like this never happened before you started here.
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time.
- Just like we did with hiring you.
No wonder that your hands are shaking!
We'll teach you! - Teach
Elfriede, so she bathes herself.
I don't use soap. Soap destroys the natural protective layer of the skin.
One can smell that.
I don't care what an alcoholic has to say about me, anyway.
It's always an argument with you guys!
Why are you so bitchy with Tatjana?
She's the bitch!
- And you are cows, stupid cows!
Done?
I love you all.
Have you never been married?
- Alas, no.
There was someone, when my parents had the accident.
As you know, they had a fatal accident in the Netherlands.
- I didn't know that.
Don't you regret coming here?
I've always been left [politically].
I didn't have a lot of options.
I used to be a waitress.
Funny. You come here voluntarily, and I want nothing more than to get away.
It is how it is.
Here and there.
I'd like to see that with my own eyes.
Maybe I'd even come back.
Then I'd be here on my own will.
Here's the list for Nicaragua.
Again already?
Do you have a pen?
Are you messing with us?
If you please...
If you please...
- Thanks.
What's going on today?
You don't dance?
- Neither do you.
Red wine, please.
Why did you donate
10 Marks?
I thought that wasn't too much.
Do you really think they get the money?
Don't you?
Dear colleagues!
Do you still have access to West Marks?
- Alas, no.
I spent the last on a
Trabant [cheap car].
You can get everything with West Marks.
- I didn't have much.
Why didn't you rob a bank?
Oh, I did.
Cheers!
I drink to that.
Günnel, Sigrid.
Janzen, Andrea.
And Blechschmidt, Klaus.
(Dance music.
People cheer.)
''Live is Live ... ''
Tatjana?
Tatjana!
Tatjana!!
Where were you today?
- I overslept.
We were worried.
- I doubt that.
What's the time?
- Half past three.
Shit.
Do you want some coffee?
If you have some, too.
I can do that.
I feel sick.
Why's it boiling already?
The current goes directly into the water.
You can't stick a spoon in there.
Or you're dead.
You are insane, using that!
My ex-husband built it for me.
- He wanted to kill you!
Thanks.
Don't use that thing anymore!
I'm invincible!
Hello!
- Hello.
My place?
I live around the corner.
Admit it, you didn't notice!
- Did you steal these?
I wanted to get ourselves a little treat.
What else have you done?
- Danced in a bar.
Really?
First, I wound myself around a pole.
Then I bent over, and everyone could see into my ass.
And what do you expect here?
(TV:) In the past, when a sailing ship got into a dead calm, when no one brought up wind, it were bad times.
Then you spent Easter off the Christmas islands ...
Strange, out of big glasses one can drink more without getting drunk.
(He sings:) What shall we do with the drunken sailor early in the morning?
You can stay.
I'll sleep soon.
There was still some left in there.
It's empty.
You poured out the booze!
Don't lie about it!
Let me go!
Give me the key!
You think
I can't climb?
Tatjana!
Do you know how much one bottle of this is, stupid western cow?
Step on the gas!
And now, shift into second gear!
Careful!
Stay on the road!
Clutch, take out the gear, and now, break!
How am I?
- First class!
Turn around!
Drive down that path in reverse!
How do I do that?
Push down on it, move it downwards.
Accelerate, and steer.
Oh!
Fuck!
This is a new car!
Doesn't matter.
It's Sunday.
Lieutenant Knorz.
Who was driving?
Me. - Licence and registration, please!
What have we done wrong?
We drove against a tree in reverse.
Exactly.
And that's what you've done wrong.
Have you had any alcohol?
- No. - Me neither.
Follow me to the garage.
Please! - Thanks.
This is a friend from school.
They should've taken him.
You had bad luck with your marriage.
Do you know that?
She was too young.
And the husband wasn't mature either.
After the divorce, she dyed her hair.
Your name is Susanne?
- Susanne Schmidt.
Pleased to meet you. Margarethe.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers people, all the best!
(TV:) From Hamburg, the news of the day.
Bloody incident at the
German-French border.
Two men died when they tried to skip border controls.
One of them is alleged terrorist Andreas Klein.
His companion is yet to be identified.
The following persons are wanted:
Bernd Ruppel, Rita Vogt.
She has a scar on the left elbow.
Caution: Those people don't hesitate to use their weapons.
Let's go dancing!
(Father:) I used to work in China, as a mechanic. Not everyone gets that far.
Susanne has been to Paris!
She moved back here nonetheless, since she likes it better.
You don't hear that often.
The concept is better:
Less poverty, less richness.
Many people died for it, all throughout the world.
I've seen the Great Wall.
They drove us there.
But, especially the people!
It's a misperception that they all look the same.
My father always talks about China.
Do you want some wine?
Home made.
My mother warned me about men.
Women never came up.
I'll leave.
They have Bulgarian tomatoes!
- Look, the colour!
I'll get some for us.
- I'll make Ratatouille then.
What? - Ratatouille.
Do you have a scar on your arm?
- Why?
Later!
Ask her if she has a scar on her arm!
- It doesn't bother me.
How is it to live with such a past?
A call to Berlin.
Step into the phone booth!
Someone recognised me.
Can I go back to my house anyhow?
She saw you on TV?
- I think so.
Did you see it, too? - Yes.
Where? - At a birthday party.
Who's birthday?
- My colleague's Father's.
So all saw it?
I was alone in the room.
I want to be entirely truthful.
- You should be.
Tatjana stood in the door.
But not from the start.
I don't know since when.
But she hasn't said anything yet.
You stay here for the time being.
I have to be at work for the first shift tomorrow.
- We'll take care of that.
I'll be missed elsewhere, too.
You are good friends.
We know that.
She bought tomatoes for supper.
She loses it, doesn't get it.
Rumors are spread.
Write a letter!
You'll be back in a couple of days.
We'll deliver it immediately.
When will I be back?
- Soon.
Dear Tatjana,
I'm in a big hurry.
I have to help a friend.
I'll be back soon!
Don't think anything by it.
It is how it is.
Sad story, the thing with Andi.
He didn't stand a chance.
You can't go back.
What do you mean?
- What I said.
Why did I have to write the letter then?
Because we needed to buy some time.
But I want to go back to Tatjana.
And how's that supposed to work?
- That's my only condition.
You are making conditions?
Do you know what would happen if your cover was blown?
The GDR signed international anti-terrorism treaties.
Your credibility is at stake.
One can easily be crushed through something like that, not only you.
Are you interested in the welfare of human beings?
That's our job.
We usually deal with male comrades.
My husband was a lieutenant, until he retired.
We always lived in the suburbs.
Twenty - twelve.
Twenty-one - twelve.
Hold on. Rematch!
How did you carry these things?
- I'll show you.
You walk differently.
Your body has a centre.
Doesn't the skin get cold?
- The gun gets warm.
Are you insane?
Why isn't the safety engaged?
- It was! - No!
You've already shot someone before!
I helped him with accounting.
He died age 32.
I didn't want to be a widow.
Please, come in.
You aren't asleep yet.
- I'm practising my third life.
Sabine Walter.
Too young to live a widow's life.
This time, you're from the East.
That'll provoke less nosy questions.
Maybe you should ... wear glasses.
You're pretty anyway.
A cat has seven lives.
Are you married?
Yes.
It's important to be married.
Visit your colleague one last time.
It won't hurt.
The story needs an ending.
Who's there?
- Susanne.
You look different.
- You too.
I knew you'd get in touch as soon as possible.
I often checked to see if your Trabbi [the car] was here.
I didn't want to abandon you.
I think it's great that I know you.
You are important, compared to me.
I want to say goodbye.
I'm going back to West Germany.
Because of my family.
- But your parents are deceased.
I have siblings.
Don't use that hellish device anymore!
What?
- That thing you use to make coffee.
People say you are a wanted terrorist.
If that was true,
I couldn't go back to West Germany.
When they mentioned the scar,
I knew.
I'm your friend.
Talk to me!
You are mistaken, Tatjana.
I beg you, believe me!
Are you going to write?
Of course!
Yes, of course.
Stop bullshitting!
Beat it!
I'll come with you.
Maybe I'll come back sometime.
I'll be gone then.
Can I sit in the back?
- Go ahead.
That was fast. What did she say?
- That she's my girlfriend.
This is the bathroom.
The kitchen.
A couple of lamps are missing.
We've unpacked everything.
Except for the books.
Call if there's any problem at all.
I want to join the [political] party.
You always need to be truthful with the party.
Can you do that?
Good morning!
This is where you're going to be working.
Mrs. Walter is going to prepare the children's summer vacation.
She used to work in her late husband's handicraft shop. - Yes.
Coffee? - No, thank you.
Your new colleagues will show you around.
Are those old ones?
- Yes.
I'm Christa. These are Beate and Monika. We address each other informally.
I'm Sabine.
I'm sorry, I can't help.
Good morning!
I've written down who we need:
FDGB [trade union], BGL [company trade union committee],
FDJ [official youth organisation], the mayor, the Hygiene, the youth's welfare, railroad, DRK [German Red Cross],
ÖV [public administration], company canteen, construction management -
- and the children's commission.
To come off best, all at one table!
Can you swim?
Don't go out that far!
Silke, not so far out!
Are you keeping an eye on the children?
Yes.
Then I am going to keep an eye on you from now on.
My name is
Jochen Pettka.
Sleep, child, sleep, mother shepherds the sheep, father shakes the tree, falls down a dream, sleep, child, sleep!
Good night!
- Good night, Sabine!
What are you reading? - "The Physics of the Next Millennium".
Here's a nice sentence:
Innovation is what you cannot see.
Seeing something new from time to time is what's beautiful in life.
Does that mean things never play out as you would expect them to? - Yes.
Thank God not always.
This is my third summer here, as a lifeguard.
You've already been here a couple of times?
- Yes, one gets to know a lot of people.
You have beautiful eyes behind your glasses.
You went straight in there!
You think so?
Ouch! - Am I hurting you?
No, it's just my sunburn.
Noon rest till 3pm!
What's that ship?
- Ferry to Sweden.
Why do so many people want to leave here?
I've never been on vacation at the Baltic Sea!
So lie, you Brothers, down in God's name, cool is the evening breeze.
Spare us, God, from punishment and allow us to sleep calmly and our sick neighbour too.
We are going to depart soon.
This is my husband ...
- Sabine Walter.
We met through our travels.
See you in a minute, on the bus!
Excuse me.
Lets just sit down!
Shitty that we don't have time.
- Yes.
This is my son, Eric.
Glad to hear you're well.
- Why do you think that?
I'm coming.
That's how you're thanked for your commitment to the summer vacation.
As they say: Children are our most valuable good.
The documents are in the file.
My personal thanks!
- Thank you.
A reward for our screwing around!
You shouldn't say things like that!
I think you have to be into things with all your heart.
Come in!
Hang up your coat!
Are you from Berlin?
Thank you.
Why haven't you got in touch sooner?
I want to marry you.
I want you to marry me.
It's a big opportunity for me.
Five years at that institute!
It's situated in the woods, in a restricted area.
But they have everything:
Swimming pool, riding arena, cinema, theatre.
And Moscow isn't far.
And one can bring one's wife.
And so I though
I'd ask you.
And what am I supposed to do there?
You'll be my wife.
- What'll I do as your wife?
You'll be the mother of my children.
It sounds a little cheesy,
I know.
I'll be the mother of your children?
You don't believe me?
I do.
Get rid of that!
Why are you wearing glasses?
For fun.
Why didn't you tell me?
- What for?
Glasses made of plain glass!
Give it to me!
Glasses without a purpose?
Let's not talk about that anymore!
Please, you don't need the be angry!
Maybe someone once thought you were more beautiful with glasses.
Are you on the pill?
- Do I have to be?
Hello.
Here I am.
I'm glad you are.
We thought about it.
It's out of the question.
We can't keep your identity a secret from the Russians.
We don't want to tell them.
But it'd be too messy.
You think you can control everything!
Right.
But I want to go there, with him!
We love each other and are going to have a child!
You don't have to have a child.
And if I have one anyway?
Are you watching West German TV?
Why?
They show GDR women holding up their children when they climb into the West German embassy in Prague.
Do you see anything of that on GDR television?
Do you see?
Some people in this country are asleep.
Those are my worries at the moment.
So I ask you of all people for your understanding.
If I couldn't go to Moscow, would you stay here?
Why?
If I can't go.
But that's why we are going to get married!
- Even if I won't come with you?
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
I'll tell you who the mother of your children really is.
I live here under a false name with the consent of the concerned agencies, because in the West, I'm wanted as a terrorist.
Are you a terrorist?
Yes.
I used to be.
But terrorists are idiots who kill innocent people.
Yes, that's what I used to do.
But you can't tell me this!
I can't know this!
I have to go there now, though.
No. 15, please step forward!
Take a seat!
Cigarette?
I came from Berlin.
Whatever. So?
This concerns an ex-colleague of yours.
Maybe some sort of girlfriend.
She's not here anymore.
We know that.
I'll gladly tell you what I know.
She immigrated into the GDR a long time ago, from the West.
I didn't believe it at first.
- Why not?
I had never heard of anything like that before.
But she was left, politically.
Her parents were killed in an accident in Amsterdam.
So she was left over alone.
Some time ago, she got word that she still has some siblings in the West, so she moved back.
Unfortunately. She was different from all the others in the shop.
She was a strong supporter of the GDR, something not everyone is.
I can't say anything bad about her in this context.
Have others talked about her?
I can't think of anything like that at the moment.
Why have I been arrested?
I'm offering you a deal.
You sign, informally, that we stay in contact.
After that, you can go home.
It's, at the same time, a sign that you're loyal to the republic.
Tatjana, the wall is gone now, and the border is open.
It's just like you always wanted it to be.
But you are in prison, because you have been in contact with a known terrorist.
And this didn't happen to you in the West, but in the East.
It's so crazy!
It is certain that nothing in the other part of Germany is ever going to be the same as it used to be.
I'm writing down what I'd say if you were here.
I imagined a life without lies and deception, as you have, even if different.
It was clear to me, we are trapped in an unjust, wrong system.
But the guerilla couldn't achieve liberation, because no one understood us.
I didn't just want to hide in the GDR,
I was looking for another world.
I wanted to move forward, not backward.
I hope you'll manage to get out soon.
The BRD [Federal Republic of Germany] demands the extradition of those persons.
How do they want to know they are here?
They've always known.
Through whom?
- Maybe through us.
Why did we hide them then?
Twice, even!
We worked our asses off to hide them.
Excuse me, comrade General.
I've had people arrested, just because they might have known about it.
Has everything been a double-cross?
Like in a secret agent flick?
If you don't explain the world to me,
I won't explain it to you either.
You have the addresses?
- I'd rather not touch this affair.
You have to touch a lot of things before you die.
We did something for them, not the other way around.
They didn't tell us much about their secrets.
Maybe they were criminals.
You can look at it like that.
But I'm disappointed that we abandon them like this.
Do you want to go home and cry?
Your weapons, please!
That's how accidents happen, girly!
- I'm sorry!
Look!
Unbelievable!
"Terrorist hidden by StaSi." [GDR's secret service]
We've lived with criminals!
Anything for peace!
Read it!
She was part of a choir.
They had money for things like that!
But we couldn't get decent Jeans.
She didn't do anything to or against YOU,
I mean, US.
One cannot live next to a murderer, though!
This isn't my government anymore.
Maybe you'll never be better off than now and here!
Here, you cannot lose your job or be kicked out of your apartment.
You don't know what you're going to miss out on.
Maybe you'll be able to afford decent trousers, but not the arse in those trousers.
You're crazy!
This here was a great attempt, a revolution.
Despite all the crap, you were part of it.
It's supposed to be a world that isn't ruled by money.
Why don't you believe in that anymore?
In yourselves anymore?
We can't do anything for you anymore.
What happened to Friederike?
- You don't know?
I do.
But what happened?
They are going to get you, too.
- This is still the GDR, though!
And in the GDR, you are going to be arrested, through the people's police.
What a screwed up ending.
East is over there, west over there.
You're wanted everywhere.
If they cannot find you today, they are going to hunt you.
Avoid airports and big train stations.
If you can, forget we've ever known each other.
I will forget that.
I can give you a ride for a little way.
Why did you arrest Tatjana?
Susanne!
Open up, it's me!
Hands up!
Against the wall!
Are you Rita Vogt?
I need to pee.
Actually, I cannot take you with me without a helmet.
You don't know that as an Eastern broad.
You were pretty much cut off.
But I don't have any prejudices.
Thanks.
It not any individual's fault.
Excuse me, I need to pee.
This is the East.
I hope she doesn't drive around here.
She's supposed to have killed several people.
- Here or in the west?
Doesn't matter, order and security have to exist everywhere.
I won't shoot.
Papers, please!

What are you looking at?
What grade are you in?
Third.
At the De Amicis school?
Not De AmEEcis!
It's called De Amicis!
It's really pronounced
De AmEEcis.
It's De Amicis.
What's that in your ear?
Ain't you got nothin' better to do?
Sorry, there's no chocolate.
What is there?
There's vanilla, pistachio, strawberry, coffee... mint and lemon.
CouId I have a cappuccino, please?
I'm waiting on someone.
I want chocoIate.
Let's see if there's some left.
Damn!
Son-of-a-bitch!
Come out of there!
You're a third grader, too?
Yes.
So you'll be my student.
I don't beIong to anybody.
Okay, if you prefer,
I'll be your teacher.
Oh, the new one.
You've also got an earring,
I see.
But isn't that what girls wear?
On the right.
Guys wear it on the left.
Ah... guys.
Vincenzino, tell me what it's like in Corzano.
Corzano?
Just Iook around you.
The streets are all busted.
The houses are smashed from the earthquake.
All there is is garbage and junkies' needles.
Every Sunday, you know what my father says?
"What the hell are we doing in this shit-hole?
Let's go to Naples."
So we dress up and go to Naples.
But when we come home, it's still Corzano.
See those guys there?
They're all crooks.
They think they own Corzano.
So I tell 'em...
"Keep this town, and its alleys and garbage!" Right?
Yes.
You know what else?
Talking of garbage, every morning... my classmate, Tommasina, rolls in garbage before class.
Then she comes to school and infects us with wigs.
Wigs?
Yeah, wigs... wigs!
Oh, lice!
Excuse me!
My suitcase!
You've made a mistake!
That's my suitcase!
Professor Sperelli!
I sent her.
She works for the rooming house.
Bring the professor's suitcase to his room.
Take it upstairs.
The view is spectacuIar.
A nice, inexpensive room, right?
It's beautiful.
Anything you need... just let us know.
You've brought that in. Good.
One small change, please.
Could we move the desk to have it face the light?
- Cecchina, come here.
- I'll heIp.
Let's move the desk so that it faces the light.
Careful. There.
Near the wall.
One moment. There.
That's it.
I'm sorry. It's a little heavy.
This way--
The bed.
He's too big to pass through.
We'll move the bed.
And the bookcase?
The bed'll go here, the bookcase there.
But then his feet-- lt's bad Iuck!
My feet?
Bad luck!
Your wife might cheat on you.
Please, don't let the girl think that.
I've been divorced for years.
But how did you know about that?
About what?
My wife running off with the dentist.
Oh, God!
I didn't mean about your wife.
You didn't?
This was for the evil eye, not your wife.
Are you superstitious?
No, not at all.
In Naples, if you sleep with your feet toward the door... it means you'll Ieave--
Feet first.
Feet first?
Like in a coffin.
I see. I haven't learned all the local customs yet.
Michele, did you bring the mozzarella?
I don't understand what she said.
It's Aunt Esterina.
She's in perfect health.
She just gets a littIe foggy sometimes.
Foggy...
Ah, Aunt Esterina, he's not Michele.
What do you mean he's not Michele?
Michele, what are you supposed to bring to your wife?
Mozzarella.
Mozzarella.
Good boy! Mozzarella!
Don't forget.
She's always dramatizing,
Aunt Esterina.
Michele is dead.
He dropped dead 15 years ago.
Michele's dead.
Get that into your head!
Corzano!
Excuse me, kids.
Where's the principaI?
Come in, Mr. Sperelli.
I'm Mimi, the janitor.
The principal is out. It's not absenteeism. She has lots to do.
It's politics.
Her husband's a councilman.
Sign here. Right here. Go on.
What is this?
It means you arrived today... and are starting work and all that. Sign.
But this paper is blank.
I'll fill it in later, when there's time.
If you don't trust me, don't sign. Who gives a shit!
Could you give me an attendance book?
Sure! Soon as I find it.
I don't see it.
I understand.
Bring it to my class, please.
We got ourselves a grouchy professor.
Look at that guy. What a nut!
This is the third grade.
Good morning, Maestro.
Good morning.
But there's nobody here.
You knew the teacher was coming today, right?
Sure.
How many are in this class?
About fourteen, sixteen.
Fourteen, sixteen--
What's your name?
Rosinella.
What's your name?
I'm Marco Tulio Sperelli.
Excuse me. Who is responsibIe for getting the kids to school?
Obviously not you.
I get it.
You stay here.
Don't leave the classroom.
- Let's go!
- What a pain!
- Where you goin'?
- For a brioche.
You'll get even fatter.
You're such a ball breaker.
We'll find those kids, one by one.
- We?
- Yes. Come aIong.
Mimi, where are you going?
Where's my brioche?
Stay in the classroom.
Sure, but it's brioche time.
You see?
I have to take care of the kids.
You also sell brioches?
Why shouldn't I?
This one is used to his morning brioche.
I have to think of the students.
I have a lot to do.
Don't waste my time,
Professor Sperelli.
I have a responsible position here.
I have lots to do.
Excuse me.
Is she the cleaning lady?
Yes. She's also my wife.
- And she's working?
- Sure, she's working!
The principal is working, you're working... the cleaning woman works, the kids work, everyone works.
And they say in the South nobody works!
You all work frenetically here!
Who is he kidding?
Let's go. Time for school.
I'm working.
To school!
Let me go!
Don Muchè, this teacher stiff s draggin' me off my gig!
You can't even speak properly.
You're coming to school.
Now, where do the others work?
There's the barber.
Vincenzino, where the hell you going?
To school!
Moano's book rated every guy who slept with her.
She said De Crescenzo was the loudest.
Giuseppe Scarano?
- Come with me.
- I didn't do nothin'!
- Who are you?
- How dare you?
He's lathering me up.
Where are you taking him?
Have you heard of compulsory schoollng?
Or of child labor laws?
Don't interfere, or I'll go to the mayor.
He is the mayor.
Wait. The man is absolutely right.
With closed eyes, I didn't realize a minor lathered me up.
Shame on you for making a boy work.
You're the new teacher from up north, right?
I'm Antonio Ruoppolo,
Mayor of Corzano.
Are you a third grader at De Amicis school?
- Let's go to school.
- I can't! I can't!
Marlboro, Merit, Marlboro.
Who smokes?
Marlboro, Merit, Marlboro.
Who smokes?
Let's go. Business is closed.
Off to school.
Let me go!
No stories!
To school, I said!
Let me go!
I don't give a fuck about school.
I got a responsibllity. I work!
Work? You call that work? Black market cigarettes aren't work!
- He smuggles.
- Fuck you. Spies!
Off to school.
Buy tangerines!
Who's this new teacher? Him?
You should be glad to go to school.
You call that a school?
It's disgusting!
It's old, broken down, with holes in the walls.
Careful. Stop.
I'll let you pass.
Those guys will run you over.
Let's go over here.
The boys pee in the sink... and clog up the toilets.
The principal won't go in there.
Ah, of course.
She don't give a shit.
Hey, guys, everyone knows the real boss is Mimi, the janitor.
Yes! He's really in charge.
He's a rotten son of a con man.
He's a Mafioso... and everyone's afraid of him.
Our school is hell.
It's called "Filthy De Amicis."
Poor De Amicis... filthy?
De Amicis was a great educator, a writer. He wrote "The Heart."
Let's go to school.
Let's go study.
Let's go. Here's the school.
Come here!
Toto, come here!
I'll catch you!
Why are you laughing?
Let's go to school. Come on.
Stop! Stop!
You go in the corner, you in that corner and face the wall.
You're starting off shamefully.
What are you doing?
I'm eating.
You ate a brioche an hour ago.
It's time for the second brioche.
A second brioche!
Put it away!
You should never overeat.
Or you'll end up like him and like the teacher.
Look at the nails. Disgusting!
Let's see them.
Rule number two:
Come to class with... clean nails.
Now... who knows this man behind me?
- That man is a caveman, right?
- Exactly.
If I lived in the Stone Age,
I could club people.
They clubbed people?
Sure. They'd meet people on the street, didn't say hello.
Just pow, pow!
And they'd beat them.
In those days, families always fought and they were all dirty.
They didn't wash or comb their hair or shave.
Even women didn't shave.
Do women shave now?
They shave their legs.
Even a newborn baby was a caveman right away.
They didn't have heat or television.
There was nothing for them to do... so they drew doodles on the walls.
Doodles?
Yes, doodles.
What does that mean?
Scribbles. Nonsense.
Dirty pictures.
I get it: prehistoric graffiti.
Man started to be intelligent... but he still looked like a monkey.
When they stopped looking like monkeys, they became Egyptians.
- Teacher, can I say something?
- Go ahead.
I can't tell the others.
Just you.
- Why?
- It's intimate and personal.
Come here.
Intimate and personal.
Your nails are dirty, too.
But I won't tell anyone.
I promise.
Now go back to your seat.
Look at him sleeping.
School isn't for sleeping.
- What is his name?
- Gennaro.
Mr. Gennaro? Wake up!
You're in school, facing your teacher.
Nice to meet you.
Stand up.
Go on out.
You'll keep standing the rest of the day... as punishment.
Go, if you have to.
What are you doing?
Oh, eating!
He's eating. Is it time for the third brioche?
Go to the blackboard. Let's see how much math you remember.
Hurry. Take the chalk.
We have to buy it from Mimi.
Chalk is school property.
Mimi, the janitor, sells it for 500 lire.
It's true.
I toId you to go. Go on.
It's the big one.
What?
The big one! Number two!
She has to poop!
Then hurry up!
I haven't got the 50 lire for toilet paper.
I'll come along.
You stay here and behave yourselves.
-The usual five sheets?
-No. It's diarrhea. A flat rate.
12 sheets for 100, plus chalk, comes to 600 lire... but you're new, so make it 500.
I'll pay 600.
No flat rate.
Help!
Let's go. Hurry!
We can make it.
We're almost there.
Here we are.
I'll wait out here.
Oh, God! Teacher!
My zipper broke!
I can't hoId it!
Wait. If you're not ashamed,
I'll help you. I won't look.
Who cares?
I'm shitting in my pants!
There.
What are you doing to that girl?
I'm doing what you should be doing.
Too late!
Wait. Damn! Now please clean her up, at least.
Me?
Who else? Me?
But, Professor, if Mimi, the janitor... didn't sell toilet paper by the piece, we'd be in deep trouble.
The State sends us nothing.
But you're perfectly right.
And thanks for gathering the kids from work.
I can't do it every day.
Sure, but it set a good example.
Let's hope so.
About the toilet paper and the chalk.
We'll write a nice letter to the Board of Education and I'll sign it.
Actually, it's better if you sign it.
You have guardian angels.
Excuse me. I don't really understand what you're saying.
Professor... Professor... there are atlIeast
500 Neapolitan teachers... who'd kill to have your job at De Amicis.
I'm at De Amicis, as you call it, only by accident.
It was a bureaucratic error.
You understand?
My assignment was to be Corsano, near my home, not Corzano.
Corzano, Corsano, with an "S."
I knew it.
It just means your guardian angel made a small mistake.
But you have a guardian angel.
You go too far!
Relax, Sperelli.
Don't get bent out of shape.
You're all red.
What's the big deal?
I mustn't get upset. Do you want me to have a premature birth?
There he is now.
My husband, the stud of Seville!
He's given me six kids in ten years of marriage.
Now that's fertile!
Please assure my colleagues who want my job... that I've requested a transfer.
Within a month or six weeks...
I'll be happily back up north.
So, happily, Professor Sperelli.
You're just passing through and you want to... fix all the troubles in the South in a few weeks... starting with De Amicis?
Even you can't pronounce
De AmEEcis properly!
Who says so?
I do. Everyone does.
No, Sperelli.
Here we all say De Amicis.
Get used to it, Professor.
Try to fit in.
You want to change too many things.
Good day, Reverend.
Don Gabrielluccio, why don't you turn around?
The view is so beautifuI.
There's the sea.
I've already seen it.
I understand.
"Gennarino Esposito,
Composition.
"My house and discussions.
"My house is all cracked.
cracked ceilings...
"cracked walls...
"cracked floors.
"Sometimes I feel cracked, too.
My mother says."
The Third World doesn't even have cracked houses.
"So we shouldn't complain.
"The Third World
is more Third than us.
"At Easter time, my father
brings home a lamb to slaughter.
"But we always feel sorry for it
and we end up keeping it.
And then my parents fight.
My mother says."
Mother of God!
Another fucking lamb!
Every fucking year these lambs!
You never have the guts to slaughter them!
I'll slaughter you!
"My father is a junk man.
"Mornings he has another job.
He comes back in the afternoons.
"He sleeps a little, eats...
"and collects
cardboard boxes at night.
Many times I go along with him."
That's why you sleep in class... because you work at night.
Now I feel badly.
I scolded you and made you stand up all day.
Don't worry.
I can also sleep standing up.
Why are you here?
Hello.
How much do you weigh?
What? Well--
Okay, I'll tell you.
I weigh 95 kilos.
And you?
I'm a mess, too... 51 kilos.
You need to be patient.
At my age, what were you like?
Me? Like this. Look.
Like that?
Exactly.
That's even worse than Mama said.
What did Mama say?
If I keep eating like this,
I'll get fat like you.
Thanks.
That's really very encouraging.
Are you on any diet?
What kind of diet do you mean?
The Jockey's Diet, Scarsdale,
Weight Watchers.
You're a regular diet expert!
More or less.
Do you diet?
No, because at home we eat normal.
Really?
Pasta and beans in octopus broth.
Octopus with olives and capers.
Meat soup, stew, vermicelli with garlic and oil... pork, innards, peas, eggs.
Pizza with meatballs and sausage. Little pizzas.
Persimmons, pears, cherries, dates and melons.
I'm getting hungry.
And for desert:
Baba, eclairs... eclairs with chocolate and cream... pastries, elephant ears, zeppole... delicious Sicilian cannoli... sfogilatelle, struffoll and rococo!
That would be normal meals?
Yes, but not all in one day.
We'd have broken pipes.
You mean a broken esophagus.
At least you don't wear an earring.
'Course I do!
Oh, God! I was ripped off.
Wait! Come here!
Wait. You look better without the earring.
I'm talking as one who knows about such things.
Aren't you coming?
- You're going to Toto's house?
- Yes, let's go.
What's wrong?
Toto thinks I'm your spy.
What do you mean, "spy"?
Do you all consider me your enemy?
- Spy!
- Fuck your ancestors!
You see? Didn't I tell you?
Here's what we'll do.
Order yourself an ice cream... and tell Vincenzino the teacher's paying.
Isn't ice cream fattening?
We'll start dieting another time.
Okay.
You're Toto's sister?
Where's your mother?
She's working.
- Your father?
- Over there.
Is he Ill?
No! He's drunk.
Who are you?
I'm the teacher.
And this is Toto's jacket.
Yes. Who knows who he stole it from.
Exactly.
The milk... turn it off, please.
I must discuss this boy with someone.
Talk to me.
To you? But--
I'm in charge here.
Could you pour the milk in the bottle? Otherwise it cools off.
We-- This morning
Toto ran away from me... left me holding his jacket and didn't come to school.
You realize he's a little too lively.
Lively? He's a delinquent, a good-for-nothing!
- Do you mind?
- What?
Feed the baby.
Excuse me.
What a beauty!
Here, beauty.
But getting back to Toto...
I think he must return to school... above all to get him off the street. You understand?
I don't want to undermine your authority.
I know you're in charge.
But I wouId like to speak with your father.
Right now my father's head isn't working.
Don't worry. Tomorrow morning, when he wakes up, I'll tell him.
What's wrong with the baby?
She's hungry.
Wait a minute.
What's her name?
Excuse me.
What's her name?
- Nanarella.
- Nanarella.
Your little sister-- Wait.
Be good.
Is her mama coming soon?
20,000 lire?
Nicola said, "The maestro is paying." It was an open order.
I said I'd pay for him, not for everyone.
Why should I be paying?
Should I be paying?
Who's the asshole buying ices for the whole third grade?
I am.
Oh, sorry.
Enjoy it.
Let him go!
What happened?
Damn your ancestors!
What a mess!
Leave him alone, Salvatore.
You're a drunkard!
I'll fix you!
You ain't gonna be a disgrace like me! Get it?
Get your ass in school!
You're always drunk! Always!
He won't be a disgrace like me!
Did you drink some bad wine this morning?
Get going, you disgrace!
Are you nuts? Leave the kid alone.
He's not a soccer ball.
Fuck off, junk man!
Lousy manners!
Get moving!
What d'you want?
A guy's gotta be a good father!
Fuck you!
Good morning.
I said good morning.
Sit down.
Why are you still standing?
Thanks to you, I can't sit.
Good job, Maestro!
You got his ass whipped!
They sent you from the North!
You busted balls the moment you got here.
Quiet.
I don't like you.
But thanks to that whipping... for the first time
I have an almost complete class.
What's your name?
Salvatore.
No. Tell me your last name.
Salvatore.
Salvatore isn't enough.
You must have a last name.
I don't remember my last name.
Gennaro's snoring.
Let him sleep.
He worked all night, poor kid.
I'm going back to work tomorrow, too.
Me, too. We need the money.
You say schooI is mandatory.
They pay you to come to school.
But who pays us? Nobody!
My dad's out of work.
They're all mad at you.
I know. I know.
Go to your seat.
That's enough.
Let's start the lesson.
Do any of you live on a street named after a famous person?
I live on the Via Garibaldi.
Garibaldi was the hero of both worlds.
He doesn't live on Via Garibaldi.
He's slinging shit!
He's slinging what?
He's lying.
He lives on Three Chicken Road.
Fine, but I want to hear about Garibaldi anyway.
Toto!
You're here?
They kicked me all the way here.
We took on that job, damn it!
Don't blame me.
Come on, shithead, walk!
Who are you?
I'm Mister Raffaele Aiello.
Mark me present.
The truck's waiting. Move it!
You, stop. Stay there.
"Mark me present"?!
Come in and close the door.
You've got some nerve!
I'm talking intelligently with one of my men... and you're crushing my cantaloupes.
What did you say?
You're smashing them--
-How do you explain cantaloupes?
-Balls!
How dare you? Get out!
I go when I want to go.
Out, you Illiterate!
You wouldn't dare.
You know, I spat in the other teacher's face... but I'll smash your face into the wall!
I won't let you! You understand?
I'm sorry.
I don't know how it couId have happened... but his face was... so full of hatred... like an aduIt... like a vuIgar delinquent, like--
Like a Mafioso.
That's for sure. This is the South, not Switzerland.
Kids like that force your hand.
I'm an educator.
All my life I've taught the philosophy of nonviolence.
Now I've hit an eight-year-old boy.
You must help me and report me to the School Board.
You should have me expelled, to set an example.
We'd have to report every teacher... every mother, every father... grandparents, uncles, one and all.
When I was young and in school... my teacher used to hit me.
My father smacked me... and my mother whacked all eight of us kids.
And I still turned out fine.
You turned out fine.
You turned out very badly.
I don't like you.
You know why?
Because your philosophy is at the root of all that's wrong in here!
- You don't like me?
- No.
I like you even less!
You're an impotent, presumptuous racist... with friends in high places.
Oh, I'm a racist?
A racist. Underneath, you're just a racist.
This is no place for you.
This is trench warfare.
It's a war here in the South.
These kids have brass balls!
And the teachers should also have them.
That slap was the best thing you've done since you got here!
Now the class wllI respect you!
Did you like what I did?
The teacher has earned your respect.
But how? By slapping one of your classmates.
You see, you now admire me... for something for which you should not respect me.
Because respect gained by force... today with a slap and tomorrow... with a revolver or a machine gun, that's not respect.
It's shame.
And it may be the cause of all the trouble in the South.
Violence is shameful in a civilized being... especially in a teacher.
I'm going home.
I don't feel well.
Anyway, I'm only here temporarily.
I don't expect to be well until I receive my transfer.
Good luck.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Have you really decided to Ieave?
Yes.
The doorbell. Who could it be at this hour? Excuse me.
Go ahead.
Michele... excuse me.
Are you angry with me?
Certainly not.
I'm a little distracted.
It's your student's mother.
Should I throw her out?
Professor,
I'm Raffaele Aiello's mama.
I have to talk to that person.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Aiello?
Please, sit down.
Watch the baby.
Do you realize?
- What?
- In our house.
What?
He's bringing women to his room!
I'm very sorry about hitting your son this morning.
I'm 45 years oId.
My husband was crippled in a shootout with customs offlcers.
I have four kids.
The oldest is called Rosario.
You know where he was until last week?
At Filangeri.
The correctional institution.
But I was happier knowing he was there... because there he wouldn't get shot.
Raffaele is the second... and he's following the same road.
When I heard... that you picked up the kids house to house...
I thanked the Holy Mother.
Now I hear you're abandoning the school.
No, no. Absolutely no.
For me, you're the last hope.
I brought you a basket of eggs.
You think life is like this?
A step forward, a step back?
Life is a ball breaker, my dear.
Is he coming?
Go see. Run!
He said he won't come, and he won't come.
- He's here!
- Sit and be quiet!
Good morning, Maestro.
Sit down.
As you see, I'm feellng better and I've come back.
Let's forget what happened yesterday.
But I see that someone didn't forget.
I'm happy to see that
RaffaeIe is also in class today.
This object, which is meant... as a vendetta against me... is human excrement in a cylindrical and squashed shape.
It is an important part of the life cycIe... just like butterflies, flowers, twinkles and stars.
Feces... have inspired many jokes and amusing stories.
They've also inspired famous writers and poets... like Dante, Boccaccio and other Neapolitan writers.
I'd like to read you something from this book.
Listen to these grandiose verses.
"Shit...
"On the street, by the sun's ray lit...
"A fly sings you a lullaby...
"So s;eep in peace...
Oh, noble shit."
Are you talking to me?
No.
"To the Board of Education.
"I, Marco Tulio Sperelli...
"am hereby withdrawing
my request for a transfer.
"I wish to remain
in my current position...
"as third-grade instructor...
at De Amicis
in Corzano, Naples. "
"Rain. My composition.
"If Jesus didn't send rain, there would be problems.
"The plants would droop, the trees wouId wilt...
"the earth would be parched, animals wouId croak.
I'd croak and so would everybody else."
A shit-load of dead stuff.
"Water is God's gift, but in Calabria it doesn't rain in the season."
Which season?
- The season.
- There are four seasons.
Yes. Autumn, winter, spring and the season.
You mean summer.
Why do you call it "the season"?
Because it's the nicest.
Not nasty like now.
You don't know whether to take a walk outdoors or inside.
Winter's okay for the rich, but for the poor, it's awful.
She doesn't give a fuck.
Her house has heat!
Is it my fault that my father works... and that I'm a material girl?
In the season, my father puts his clothes in the fridge... so they smell fresh.
Be brave, Nicola.
Off with the pants!
Have some pity!
Yesterday, did you really... buy a stereo cassette pIayer in Naples?
How did you know?
And instead of the stereo, you found a brick in the box?
Two bricks.
They made a fool of you!
How could you let them?
Even the Japanese don't fall for that!
Not even the Germans.
Not even the Milanese!
That's just about everyone.
Even the janitor?
Sit down.
- What'll you do?
- How do you mean?
You should get back at him!
Should I tell the police?
What would you do?
No, wait a minute.
Talk one at a time!
I'd say,
"I'll kick your whore mother!"
I'd tell that shithead,
"Fuck your dead ancestors!"
"Your old lady does it with dogs!" I'd say.
I'd bang his head 50 times!
I'd stick it up his ass!
And up his mother's twat!
Oh, my God!
I'd crack his fat ass.
I'd grab him and say,
"Your mother is a fart jockey!"
- Enough!
- Then I'd sing:
"Your father's ass smells like a zoo.
"Your sister's tits need glue.
"Sailors pay a buck to give your mama a screw.
Cops like her, too.
Their balls turn blue."
Enough vulgarities.
We'll continue our lesson.
How many months are there in each season?
January, February and March, but not all, and December... are winter months.
Some of March, Aprll, May and some of June... are spring months.
Some of June, July, August and some of September... are summer months, and all the rest are autumn.
Professor, she'll talk forever!
It's ten after one!
Why didn't the bell ring?
Professor, I'm starving!
All right, put away your books.
- What are we waiting for?
- The bell.
- Where's the janitor?
- On the phone, as usual.
Is it raining?
A drizzle.
A drizzle.
Let's go before it starts to pour.
Not before Mimi rings the bell.
It's 1:15. The kids are hungry.
ShouId I ring the bell?
You'll have to deal with that maniac!
No problem.
Go ahead.
Go on. Leave.
Let's go, too.
Excuse me.
Stop! Stop! Where are you going?
Who dared do this?
Who rang the bell?
Come right back inside!
Nobody leaves this school before I ring the bell.
I'm in charge. Who was it?
Who dared to ring the bell?
I did. So what?
Oh, yeah? I knew it, Professor!
This is my job.
You're the teacher. You teach!
Come on. Everybody inside!
He insulted you!
Call him a fart jockey!
Why didn't you ring the bell on time?
Why? Because, that's why!
Inside, kid!
- Call him a fart jockey!
- Say it!
Enough clowning around.
Let's go.
You're making trouble!
Wait. Excuse me.
What's going on?
This man is upsetting the discipline... and he doesn't respect my position.
Enough of this nonsense.
Madame Principal, permit us to leave.
You stop the nonsense, Sperelli.
No Northerner is gonna tell me what to do!
Call him a fart jockey!
Will you call him a fart jockey?
I'll teach this fart jockey teacher a lesson!
You see?
He got you!
I goofed!
"SwitzerIand."
She wrote a composition about Switzerland.
Her Uncle Pasquale came from there.
"Switzerland faces Switzerland,
Italy, Germany...
"Switzerland and Austria.
"Switzerland sells weapons to the whole world...
"so they can kill each other off.
"But the Swiss won't even fight a small war.
"They use that money to build banks...
"but not good banks.
"Banks for bad guys and for druggies.
"Sicilian and
Chinese delinquents...
"deposit millions in there.
"The police go and say,
'Whose money is this?'
"The bank says:
'That's our fucking business.
The bank is closed!"'
"But it isn't closed.
"It's open.
"In Naples, if you have cancer, you die.
"But if you go to Switzerland, you die later or you might live.
"Their hospitals are the most beautiful.
"Carpets, flowers, polished stairs...
"not even one rat.
It's so expensive that only crooks can afford to go there."
End of composition.
That composition's really dangerous.
If the immigration people hear it, they'll deport us.
This is her first Christmas.
She's beautiful.
- How's her fever?
- It's gone.
What did she have?
Nothing. A touch of measles.
What's your temperature?
102. Put it there, please.
What did that baby have?
A touch of measles.
Esterina, it's not carnival time.
It's New Year's Eve, and the professor is sick.
Let's bring him chamomile tea, and then we'll ceIebrate.
"Tommasina Rocco.
Composition.'Being Sick.
"When I get sick, it's trouble
for the whole house.
The doctor who visits me
isn't too good."
Let's hope the turd knows what he's doing.
"'Let's hope the turd
knows what he's doing'...
"says my father.
"But he doesn't know
and gives me the wrong medicine.
"Often he mistakes
one sickness for another...
"and after five or six days,
I'm as sick as before...
if not worse. "
To the souls of all your dead ancestors!
I should spit in Dr. Nicolella's face!
"The first doctor
is called Dr. Nicolella.
"The second one is Dr. Arnone
and he gets 100,000 lire.
"My father hasn't got the money
for the second doctor...
"and has to go into debt.
"When the second doctor arrives...
"he's not like the first one...
"who acts without
knowing anything.
"The whole family trembles.
Giuseppe pees.
"The doctor says nothing.
"Nothing.
He examines me quietly.
"He is very tall.
"He seems dead.
When he talks...
"he scares the shit out of me.
"But he always guesses
the right illness.
"When he leaves...
"my father curses the Madonna
and breaks everything.
And I cry in bed
because it's all my fault. "
Very good, Tommasina!
Dr. Nicolella. Dear God!
I'm sorry to call you so late.
A high fever.
It's probably a touch of the measles.
Good evening.
- You're Doctor--
- Nicolella, at your service.
What happened?
What's wrong?
What's going on?
Call Giovanni. Tell him they arrested me. I need a lawyer.
Damn it!
That's my brother, assholes!
Buy mimosas! It's March 8!
Let me have four more, please.
Four more.
For Lucietta... for Flora...
Tommasina...
Rosinella.
Thank you.
I brought these to celebrate
March 8, Ladies' Day.
You're whistling? You know why we celebrate Ladies' Day?
I think women shouId be equal to men.
Otherwise it's not fair.
They're equal on March 8.
Only on March 8?
No, not you!
Today you and I are dieting.
We'll eat again tomorrow afternoon. All right?
Mother of God!
Be brave.
Please, one at a time.
Take it easy.
Salvatore, at least today, tell me your last name.
Salvatore.
Not your first name.
Tell me your last name.
I've been asking you for four months--
Where's the last pastry?
- Huh?
- No "Huh"!
Put it back.
Confiscated!
Nobody gets it now.
Back to your seats.
Let's talk a little more seriously about Ladies' Day.
You bring women flowers, but you don't like women.
I don't?
You're unmarried.
You have no chlldren.
So, you must be a faggot.
What?
Faggot!
He's no faggot.
How dare you!
Why get mad?
What's the big deal?
My uncle in NapIes is a fag.
He's very nice.
I'm sure he is.
I'm straight, and I am married.
Oh, you see? He's married.
And where's your wife?
My wife left.
Sure, because you're a faggot!
No, because we're divorced.
She had a problem.
She always wanted to be right.
Let's drop the subject... and get back to our lesson.
You have two hours to write your answers.
Now...
A woman...
Are you writing this?
...goes to the market.
She has 10,000 lire.
- You're flnished already?
- Yes.
Can I ask you an intimate and confidential question?
Certainly.
If someone is divorced, can he remarry?
Yes.
All right, the two hours are up.
Please turn in your exercise books.
Recess time.
Don't get the wrong idea.
Let's split it and not tell.
That's Raffaele on the scooter.
Look how reckless!
Raffaele!
Stop being reckless!
Raffaele, riding a horse--
Are you idiots? When he's killed himself, will you be happy?
Whose bike?
His jailbird brother owned it.
He'd mug people with it.
What a delinquent. A bike, muggings, drugs, jail, cemetery!
A great career!
Why is it that in Naples lately, that's all you ever see on TV?
Once I watched a Madonna concert.
Then the TV broke, and I never got to see it.
Thinking about it makes me crazy.
I don't mean TV shows.
I mean news programs.
My father aIways watches dinnertime news.
Pasta, trouble!
Dessert, trouble!
When my father sees the word "Naples," he says...
"Be quiet. Let's see what new trouble there is.
Because they write 'Naples' just to tell us about troubles."
What you call troubles is peopIe getting killed on the street.
We in Corzano are better off.
We only have 8 deaths a year.
Well, then we can rest easy.
My grandma lives in Salvatore.
It's like a war zone there.
They'll kill you for anything there.
Why do you think these things happen?
The Mafia and drugs!
Ah, the Mafia and drugs.
It's a painful subject, but let's talk about it.
What do you know about drugs?
First it makes you happy.
Then you become an idiot.
One gram costs 10 million.
But all druggies are poor, so they steal... and mug people... and kill their parents.
You see lots of rainbow-colored butterflies... and you want to fly.
Then it's gone, and you only see Corzano.
What's going on? The motorbike broke. Please stop.
Hold it! I said stop!
Well, what happened?
I'm out of gas.
Will the bike fit on the roof?
Sure.
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Or are you ashamed to ride with us?
I had business in NapIes.
It's okay.
Queen Maria Carolina was the sister of Marie Antoinette.
You remember
Marie Antoinette?
The one in the French RevoIution.
They chopped off her head.
- They were right!
- They were jeaIous, like you.
You think the French RevoIution was caused only by jealousy?
And because Queen Marie
Antoinette had a good life.
She got up at five past noon... had breakfast with cappuccino and cake... washed her face, nalls and the bidet... and bought loads of dresses and jewelry.
So people got mad.
She got on all their nerves.
So they started the French Revolution.
They pummeled each other and spat in each others' faces.
Then they invented the guillotine... and chopped off everyone's head.
Chop, chop, chop!
I know everyone says it's wrong... but it's right: men are not equal.
Some are handsome, some ugly, some tall, some short.
Some are smart; some are dopes.
There's real men and shitheads.
And there are different nationalities.
For instance,
I hate the Germans...
'cause they're always starting wars.
I hate the British... because they think they're better than anybody.
I hate the French... because they're always making wine wars against us.
So you hate just about everybody.
I only like Italy.
Actually, just half of it.
I hate Northerners because they treat us like animals.
Yes, like animals.
If someone drops a piece of paper in Milan... they say he's from Naples, without knowing if he is.
I know he's from Naples, but how do they know?
Now, my dear Neapolitans... you'll pick up all the litter and cans.
Otherwise I'll hate you all.
During the Easter vacation,
I want you each to... write a composition about any parable you choose.
Raffaeie, come here.
- Why don't you write one too?
- No.
Go on... just to see how you write.
Ya got here and now you're in my face.
I don't understand.
That's Arabic.
You're being too pushy.
He should write about the parable of the lost sheep.
Shithead!
Write about lost sheep yasself.
I didn't even want to come along!
Enough! Let's go.
Damn it to hell!
Look at this.
His gasoline leaked all over!
The little bastard!
You said you were out of gas!
Just look! A broken gas cap!
He didn't really want to come along. He ran out of fuel.
The lost sheep!
You should have come with us.
Why be ashamed of that?
Let me go!
Stop it!
You gonna slap me again?
- Raffaele!
- You'll pay for this!
Where are you going?
Is Moses' Ark a parable?
It's Noah's Ark, dummy!
He embraced that mummy and said:
"Lazarus, I forgive you this time... but if you die again,
I'll beat you up."
Good for Lazarus!
Happy Easter, Maestro.
Professor Sperelli, a letter for you.
Good evening, Professor.
Did you all enjoy yourselves?
Weren't you sick today?
You should have come aIong.
I was money sick.
Papa doesn't have any.
But... why didn't you tell me?
I'd have given it to you.
It's okay. Next time.
All right, next time.
When I'm big,
I want to earn piles of money.
So do I.
My papa says without dough, you can't do anything.
And then he makes a disgusting face at himself... in the mirror.
And I know that he wants to spit at himseIf.
And I feel sorry.
You shouldn't feel bad about your father. He's a good man.
See you tomorrow.
So long.
A beautiful evening.
I see that you, too, are enjoying... your wall.
I received a letter today.
Some bad news about my future here.
It's made me sad.
Well, that's life.
I shouIdn't take it so hard.
"At least there's the sun," as Neapolitans say.
We also say...
"Life is like the ladder in a chicken coop.
Short and shitty."
I understand.
Fine.
Thank you... for your comforting words.
I'm going to sleep.
Maestro!
Maestro, it's Raffaele Aiello.
My mama's sick. If she's not in the hospital soon, she'll die!
We'll have to call an ambulance.
Come on.
What is it?
Excuse me for disturbing you.
One of my pupils' mother is sick.
Can I call an ambulance?
I keep the hospital's number here in case of emergencies.
- Here it is.
- Thank you.
Calling the hospital is pointless! They won't come.
Be quiet. Let me do it.
They're in cahoots with the Mafia.
Hello, hospital?
We need an ambulance.
It's a matter of life and death!
He's sick?
In Corzano.
What do you mean there aren't any?
- Call a private ambulance?
- Forget it. They cost millions.
Excuse me. How much would that come to, more or less?
What?
A million two hundred thousand!
- Forget it.
- You're disgusting!
Taking advantage of people's pain!
You're in cahoots with the Mafia! I'll report you.
They hung up.
Naturally they hung up.
Let's get going!
I'll come with you.
Excuse me.
- We'll take my car.
- We can't.
- Why not?
- I punctured your tires.
What?
I punctured your tires, and I put sugar in the gas tank.
- Sugar?
- It fucks up the engine.
Damn it! Why?
Explain that to me!
For revenge. Remember how you made me look like shit?
Or did you forget?
Come on.
Now you don't want to help me!
I knew it! Fuck you!
Wait. I'm coming with you.
Wait!
I do want to help you.
How do we take her there?
I'll pinch a car, and you'll drive.
Pinch a car?
I steal it, and you drive.
Okay.
Oh, damn! I'm not insured.
Let's go!
Forget about that one.
- Why?
- I'll explain later. Come on!
- Look at those.
- These here?
Not so loud! We're stealing!
Sorry. I'm new at this.
Damn, they're all locked.
Raffaele, I'll look over there.
Raffaele.
I'll steal this one.
Let's steal this.
It's convenient and has a stick shift.
What the fuck?
You wanna steal Half Ear's van?
- What's going on?
- Yes. I can explain it to you.
Raffaele.
We were lucky.
Half Ear is a friend.
You see? There still are some good people around.
Sure. He's a black marketeer.
Sorry, Mrs. Annunziata.
This road's very bumpy.
Never mind, Half Ear.
I'm so grateful to you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you all.
Help me.
Take the cigar box from under her head.
This cigarette carton is softer.
She'll be more comfortabIe.
I ruined your car, and you're not even mad.
Revenge for what?
What did I do to you?
Before, they used to respect me.
You made me lose face in front of everybody.
I did?
You want to ruin my life and change me.
You want me to be like you.
But I want to be a man.
I don't wanna care for anybody.
Listen, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
There's a sick woman.
Please get a stretcher.
Wait. An orderly wllI be coming.
A good-looking girI--
Mama's in bad shape.
Where are the orderlies?
- They're busy.
- Busy.
What do you mean, busy?
Can't you call them, please?
I'll call them.
Hey, asshole, get a stretcher now, or I'll slaughter you!
- But I'm a nurse.
- Now you're an orderly!
All right.
You don't have to get excited.
She's in pain!
The nurse will give her a shot.
Can't you see the problems we have here? Be patient!
The nurse will come to give her a shot.
Nurses?
They fuck all night long!
They fuck?
They fuck, fuck, fuck.
And they don't give a fuck.
This pIace is filthy.
There are roaches in the beds, but the raghead is the worst.
What?
The raghead. The nun.
The sister.
When she walks, everybody trembles.
If I met her on the street,
I'd run her over.
Here you're better off dead.
Mama! Mama!
Where's her shot?
Hold on, kid.
How dare you!
If Half Ear were here, she'd already have her shot.
What's going on? Quiet!
Why's this kid here? Out! Scram!
Ugly, bratty bitch!
Give this woman a shot now!
Or will you wait until she dies?
You ugly raghead!
All right, calm down!
You're crazy!
Get that injection ready.
- I'm sorry.
- You were better than Half Ear.
How is she?
Don't worry.
The worst is over.
Please.
Go haul ass an git th' 6:15.
Aunt's cumin'.
You understand?
Not a word.
You'd better leave, or you'll miss the 6:15 bus.
My aunt is coming.
Okay, but when your mother wakes up... tell her I owe her a basket of eggs.
How come?
She gave them to me so I'd get you back to school... and off the streets.
But now I won't be able to earn them.
I'm being transferred.
I'm going back up north.
Jesus! For real?
Jesus. For real.
Although you don't want to admit it... you were beginning to change.
Me? You got some nerve!
You're changing!
How?
You stole a van.
You smacked a nun against a wall.
Two more weeks with me, and you'd learn how to live.
Then it's really time for me to leave.
Look here.
- Two nice color photos.
- Can I sign it?
Yes, you should all sign it.
And write a lot.
Thank you. Staying with you was like being at home.
Professor... if you get lonely among those mountains... come back here.
Okay.
You'll marry Esterina, eh?
A good idea.
There's her husband's pension, my pension, yours--
- We like you a lot.
- Teacher.
These are our compositions about parables.
Read them on the train.
No, no.
Give them to the new teacher.
Please, behave yourseIves with him.
For Easter, send me a postcard.
You know the address.
Sure. We have to send you the car with a new engine.
It'll be ready in 15 days.
I'll never forget you, not even when you're dead.
Teacher, can we write to you?
Yes, but in your best handwriting.
If I write, will you answer?
Yes.
You promise?
I promise.
Teacher.
Salvatore...
Sco-gna-mi-gllo.
Very good!
Professor, this is for you.
It's a man's earring.
It's made of gold!
We all chipped in.
Except Tommasina.
But I--
I'll wear it now, okay?
No?
The left!
The right's for... faggots!
Oh, yes.
Raffaele didn't come?
You can't leave without seeing this beauty!
I haven't seen you in school recently.
I've been on maternity leave.
- I know.
- Well?
Well--
Professor, you finally managed to go back up north.
I did?
It's you who sent me away.
- We? No, you!
- You!
No, not us! You did!
You did. Anyway, good evening.
My regards to the stud of Seville.
Same to your sister!
Your mama's a fart jockey.
Good for you, Professor.
Have a good trip. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
This is for you.
What's in here?
My composition. I tried.
Good for you.
School is bad, but you're not.
Michele, hurry back.
Please come back soon!
I'll come back, and I'll bring mozzarella!
Composition.'
My favorite parable...
is about the end of the world.
It doesn't scare me since I'll
already be dead a whole century.
God will divide everybody...
to the right and to the left.
Those in the center
will go to Purgatory.
There'll be millions... more
than there are Chinese people.
There will be three doors.'
A huge one for hell...
a medium one for Purgatory...
and a tiny one for Heaven.
Then God will say,
"Silence, all of you. "
And then he'll divide everyone.
One here, another one there.
If any smartasses
try to switch doors...
God will see them and say,
"Hey, where you goin'?"
The Earth will explode.
The stars will explode.
The sky will explode. Corzano
will be in a thousand pieces.
The good will laugh,
and the bad will cry.
Those in Purgatory will laugh
a little and cry a little.
The babies
will turn into butterflies.
Me, let's hope I make it.
Guards
Yes
I want to see chen Lie and Yan Lebu
Yes, I'll call them
An order from the emperor... asking for chen Lie and Yan Lebu to see him, chen Li and Yan Lebu are here,
Your Majesty
Long live, Your Majesty chen Lie
I'm here
Yan Lebu
I'm here
I've already read about your letters
You two are still pleading
... for the poorly educated Han people
I just don't understand
... why you're doing this!
Your Majesty
About the case of Jiang Nan Words,
... too many people were involved
The scholar, Lui Liuliang, chief Secretary, cha Zhiting and
Wang Jingqi, the staff of General Liang;
They were punished because of the words they used
That was in accordance with my decree
They were trying to oppose the government
They deserved to die
However, the people in southern china
... are very angry
If we don't tackle the situation in time,
... the consequences could be drastic!
What a great Government Officer!
Yan Lebu
Yes, your Majesty
You're a Manchu
How can you plead for them?
Don't you still want your head?
I'll take the risk to tell you the truth
It's for the sake of ching Dynasty's welfare
I hope that you'll consider our suggestion
I don't care if I lose my life
The Emperor's order is the law
It cannot be changed all the time
How dare you disrespect the emperor!
Don't think that you're from the White Flags
... and I cannot kill you
We're really loyal to your Majesty
Please reconsider our suggestions
Get out!
Please excuse us
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
Pass on my word
Have those two traitors executed
Yes, your Majesty
Your Majesty
I have something to inform you, but I'm not sure if I should
Stop mumbling. Tell me now
Yes, your Majesty. There's a saying... that an Emperor doesn't kill the consultants
If you have them eliminated...
I'm afraid it could arouse trouble!
From what I see...
What is your good opinion?
For the sake of your Majesty's reputation,
I think... we should do it secretly
Yes
Xin Kang
Yes, your majesty
I'll leave it to you
Do a clean job. Got it?
Yes, your Majesty
If there're any mistakes,
... you'll lose your head
Yes, your Majesty
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
How goes the task I gave you?
Your Majesty, chen and Yan are important officers
We have to be very careful
I'm still waiting for the right chance
I wouldn't be kept waiting forever,
I hope?
Sorry, your Majesty
Your Majesty
I have one weapon that can... behead a man 1 00 paces away
The victim will never know what him
What is it called?
The Flying Guillotine
Your Majesty
This is the Flying Guillotine
How can this weapon... take a man's head 1 00 steps away?
This can kill the enemy at the speed of light
Just control this chain
If it catches the enemy's head, a hood will drop down. Pull the chain
... and 3 sharp blades will be triggered
Victims will be beheaded and killed instantly
The Flying Guillotine is really powerful!
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
I want to see how it really works
Yes, your Majesty
Your Majesty
For the Flying Guillotine,
I still can't control it well enough
So I can only shoot it within 4 steps
After I've mastered it,
I can do it beyond 1 00 steps
This weapon is powerful indeed
Once you've mastered it,
I'm afraid even I won't dare sleep at night
This slave wouldn't dare...
I doubt if you'll have the guts
Yes, your majesty
Xin Kang, listen...
At your service
Let Xin Kang be promoted to join the Yellow Flags
From the special agents, choose the 1 2 best imperial guards... and train them to use the Flying Guillotine
Those 1 2 agents have to be loyal to me or I'll kill everybody related to them
For just one traitor, many will be killed
Yes, your Majesty
The Emperor is leaving...
With the spirit of God, we promise to be loyal to your Majesty and be at your service forever;
Even if it means risking our lives
The mountain can be torn down, but our will won't change
If we have second thoughts, we shall kill ourselves
...with no regrets
This oath we take willingly
Xin Kang
Ma Teng
Xu Shuangkun
Xie Tianfu
Luo Peng cha Zhiliang chen Xinyi cheng Ziping
Wang Xiaoliang
Yu Weixiao
Zhao Xueli
Sun Jian
Zhou Zhizhong
Guys, consider yourselves lucky to be the chosen ones
From now on, we must practise the Flying Guillotine hard
With your levels of basic Kung Fu, you will master the weapon in 6 months
Let's start
Release
Practise again
Pull
You're good
That's great!
You have some good moves
You two seem to be the best
But the distance is still too short
Practise again
Yes
An imperial decree from the Emperor
Please listen
By the order of the emperor,
Ma and Xu are awarded with
1 00 taels of gold for doing well with the Flying Guillotine
It's an encouragement for them
Thank the Emperor for his kindness
Mr. Zhang
Mr. Zhang, we just started to practise today
How does the Emperor know about it?
Had he been some ordinary person... how could he be the Emperor?
Xin Kang, be very careful
Brother Xu,
The emperor knows everything
He's like God continue practicing
Hey, everybody!
I think you're all tired
Take a bath and rest for a while
We'll practise again at night
Okay
Let's go
Brother Ma, are you tired?
I'm okay.
Looks like I'm getting used to it
I don't understand why the emperor asks us to learn the Flying Guillotine
That's needless to say
Of course it's for killing the traitors
Who? Who'd dare to betray?
The emperor just needs to give the order
He can kill whomever he wants
Why waste all this effort... to kill people with the Flying Guillotine?
Well, I don't understand either
Reckon, the emperor must have his reasons
Ever since we started practicing,
... we haven't left the palace once
I can' stand it anymore
You little kid, already thinking about women?
What so funny about it?
Oh, come on! I'm not a eunuch
More than a month without ' it ' kills me!
Good...
Keep going...
Quickly...
Keep going...
Quickly...
Good...
Who are you?
Why are you here?
Oh, I understand
You're like me who can't stand the loneliness of the palace, right?
But I haven't met you before!
How can we...
Who are you?
My name is Wanzhu
The emperor sent me to you as a present
The emperor remarked... you're not a eunuch
So instead of sending you gold etc; K he just asked me to wait upon you well
Brother Ma,
... the emperor really knows everything
What did you say?
Tonight, I'll sleep here with you,
I want to talk to you till dawn
Ma Teng
Yes
You do it
Yes
Release
Good...
The Emperor is here...
Rise
Ma Teng
At your service
You're young and capable. Good!
You can aim perfectly in just 4 months
Keep it up. You'll have a bright future
Thank you, your Majesty
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
There's still something
I don't understand
The Flying Guillotine spins in the air
Say if someone gets defensive in advance... the Flying Guillotine won't work, right?
Your Majesty, the Flying Guillotine spins at a very high speed
Anything that hits it... will be driven away by the spinning force
Show me again
Yes, your Majesty
Ma Teng
Yes
Your Majesty,
Even if the enemies use weapons for defence, their Kung Fu can't save them from death
Even if the enemies lie on the floor, the Flying Guillotine can still take their lives
Very good
This thing really seems invincible
You all just keep up the good work & practice
I will give everybody rewards
Thank you, your majesty
Xie Tianfu
Yes, your majesty
So, how was the gift
I sent you last night?
It's my fault. Sorry
How can you be that useless?
Are you really a eunuch, or what?
When I gave you such a good reward, you should enjoy it to its fullest
Don't worry. It's not your fault
Thank you, your Majesty
The Emperor is leaving...
Brother, what happened?
Nothing much
Brother Xu, sorry
Are you blind?
Shit! You wanted to kill me?
No... I didn't do it on purpose
Stop it
Stop fighting... Stop!
Ma Teng, why are you fighting?
My mother gave me this Jade Buddha
He stepped on it;
... which means he disrespects my mom
That's why I have to beat him up
Ah Kun, go back
Who? Who?
Mr. Xin. It's me
Ah Kun, it's you?
I thought it's someone else
What are you doing here at midnight?
My... my purse has gone missing
Maybe you dropped it in the training hall
I'll have a look there come back quickly
Yes, Mr. Xin
You should rest earlier
What are you doing?
I want to meet His Majesty
Search him
Yes
Go in
Your Majesty
Xu Shuangkun is here to see your Majesty
Xu Shuangkun
Why are you here this late?
It's my fault
I met Mr. Xin when I got out
He almost knew the secret
I got myself out with a little trick
What do you have to report to me?
Your Majesty,
I've found Ma Teng having second thoughts
He is planning a rebellion
Ma Teng?
He practiced a lot and improved quickly
How can you tell he's having a second thought?
Well, I've been observing him
He's been acting mysteriously
So I think he must have something in mind
Today, why were you fighting with him?
He almost killed me with the Guillotine
Therefore... you want to take revenge here, right?
This slave wouldn't dare...
I really appreciate Ma Teng's Kung Fu
He will become somebody great later
I'm planning to make good use of him, unless you can prove what you've said
Yes, your Majesty
Go away
Yes
Success!
They've succeeded
A secret decree from the Emperor
Xin Kang shall receive it
Yes.
-Ma Teng
-Yes
-Xie Tianfu
-Yes
-Luo Bong
-Yes
-Xu Tianfu
-Yes
The Emperor ordered... that you commence your mission at once
Yes
Master, please have some Ginseng tea
Put it on the table
That is Officer chen
Are you sure, Mr. Xin?
I'm sure. Do it
Do it, quickly
Master...
Oh no...somebody is coming!
The lord's head is gone!
Lord Yen, please don't bother
I'll walk you till here
Master...
Somebody come quickly...
Master...
We've killed two government officers chen Lie and Yan Lebu
Those two officials were loyal and honest
Of course
The whole world knows about it
These two people are brave enough to tell emperor the truth
They saved a lot of scholars
I don't understand... why would the emperor have them killed
I heard that at Mr. Yan's funeral... weeping people lined the streets
They all think these mysterious beheadings... are something unbelievable
Okay. Let's do it like this
You take us as your godsons
We'll be at your service from now on
No. How can l?
Please sit down
We must pay our respects
Kowtow to our godfather
Alright...
Everyone, rise
It's Officer Shi's house
Yes. He's also a good government officer
Why the emperor wants him dead?
Brother Ma, what happened to me?
My hands can't stop shaking
I can't do this
We'll climb up to the top of the wall there
We'll get for sure from the top, let's go
Where's Tianfu?
Xie Tianfu, are you ok? come here come here quickly
Mr. Xin
Tianfu. You do it
I...
Do it...
I can't...I can't do it
I can't kill anymore
I can't be the killer for the emperor
I can't kill anymore
I can't be the killer for the emperor
I can't...
Tianfu, calm down
It's okay. Let's go
I can't kill anymore. I...
Master...
Somebody come quickly
Master was assassinated
Xie was scolding over there
... and insulting the emperor
Godfather
Ah Kun. come over here
Godfather, you look worried
I just got a secret decree from the Emperor
Who is it today?
You read it yourself
Xie Tianfu
I'm afraid...
What's the matter with you?
I had a nightmare
You're just too tired.
I'll get you some tea
Tianfu
Who did it?
Who killed Xie Tianfu and Wanzhu?
Who? Who...
I did
It's you?
You killed Xie Tianfu and Wanzhu
I did
I killed Wanzhu
You're all crazy. All of you
You've lost your mind and soul
Xie Tianfu has been through a lot with us
He's our brother
What actually did he do?
How can you do this to him?
It's the emperor's order. We can't refuse
He asked us to learn the Flying Guillotine
... in order to eliminate betraying officers
I can't believe, our brother
... was killed by the Flying Guillotine
Maybe someday it'll be my turn
... or your turn!
We have taken an oath on our lives
We'll forever be loyal to the emperor
Our heads don't belong to us anymore
So it doesn't matter about our family
Yes, we've lost our mind and family
We're not human
We're just killing tools for the emperor
Killers for the emperor
Xin Kang is here to see your Majesty
Ma Teng offended me and disobeyed me
I order you to execute him
Yes, your Majesty
Wait a minute
Yes, your Majesty

Everybody talks about Feng Yang
Feng Yang used to be a great place
But since we had a emperor from this place
We had 9 bad years out of 1 0
The rich ones sold their land
Master, you're here. This way, please...
What do you want to eat?
A bottle of wine and a big bowl of noodle
Yes
Everybody talks about Feng Yang
There're disasters every year
The dam was broken and this resulted in floods
Acres of fields have gone under water
Welcome
Please go in, there're seats
Master, here's your noodle
Good...
Master, please spare me a few coins
Master, be kind, spare me a few coins
Thank you
Mister...here is your food and wine
Get out...
Go away chase
Have you seen anyone suspicious?
No
Ma Teng. Follow us back
You can't escape come down
Take him away
Left hand with a gong and right with a drum,
We carry the gong and drum and sing a song
I don't think I can sing other songs,
I just know the tune of Feng Yang Song
Feng Yang Song
Our life is tough. It's really tough
I can't get a good husband in my life
Other's husbands all have a wonderful job
My wife at home has a pair of big feet
It's longer than a foot...
Good...
You're injured!
There's an old temple there.
Let's rest there
Miss, I'm cold. can you start a fire, please?
You lie down here. I'll get you a doctor
Miss
You can't get a doctor here, you can't
But look at you...
I'd rather die here than call a doctor
I understand
Miss, don't go
You've saved me, how can I pay you back?
I wanted to. You don't have repay me
Why were you caught?
Sorry, I can't tell you
See you
Miss
May I know your name?
Sorry, I can't tell you
My surname is Ma. Ma Teng
I know
You know?
Your pictures are everywhere in the city
Everybody knows you
But you're not scared of me...
I'm not. The Emperor nabs people everyday
He only killed the innocent and good folk
Let's go now
This is not a safe place
There're guards everywhere
I'm also injured
Where can I go?
Do you live around here?
I lost my family and I have no home
We can run together
We'll go through this together
I'm not worried about living, wait...
I have a lot of gold
It belongs to the emperor
This is useless
If you expose identity, you still have to die
Don't worry. I know farming
I know how to keep pigs
This gold is useless
