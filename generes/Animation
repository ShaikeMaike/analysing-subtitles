Once upon a time, a long time ago, a king and queen had a beautiful daughter named Fiona.
But she was possessed by a terrible curse.
By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.
Only true love's kiss could lift her curse.
So Fiona waited in a tower, guarded by a dragon, until the day when her true love would arrive.
But as the days turned into years, the King and Queen were forced to resort to more desperate measures.
Whoa, there.
I don't know about this, Lillian.
Fairy Godmother said only true love's kiss could break Fiona's curse.
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.
Besides, he does come highly recommended by King Midas.
But to put our daughter's life in the hands of this... person?
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...
Rumpelstiltskin!
Mrs. Highness.
How do you do?
Down, Fifi. Get down!
As you can see, everything's in order.
So you'll put an end to our daughter's curse?
And, in return, you sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to me.
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?
Fiona has been locked away in that tower far too long.
It's not like she's getting any younger.
But to sign over our entire kingdom?
Well, if your kingdom's worth more to you than your daughter...
Nothing is worth more to us than our daughter.
Jump, Fifi, jump!
Just sign it and all your problems will disappear.
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!
Who saved her?
No one would have guessed that an ogre named Shrek, whose roar was feared throughout the land, would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.
True love's kiss led to marriage and ogre babies!
The kingdom of Far Far Away was finally at peace.
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!
Sir? You're gonna have to pay for that.
Maybe we could make a deal for it, little boy?
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?
Nobody needs your deals anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!
I wish that ogre was never born!
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.
Better out than in.
That's my line.
Did my little Fergus make a...
...big, grownup ogre stink?!
Oh, that's diabolical!
And on your left, the lovable lug that showed us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop...
...and finally, into the castle.
Play date!
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
Happily...
- Ever...
- After.
Look! A shooting star!
So, what did you wish for?
That every day could be like this one.
Come here, you.
Morning, Daddy.
Morning.
Better out than in.
Did my little Fergus make a...
Cute. Real cute.
This lovable lug taught us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
Play date!
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After?
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...
- Play date!
- No!
Outhouse again!
Come on.
Undies!
Outhouse!
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After.
Roar.
Nice landing, baby.
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.
Happy birthday, niños!
Vamos a la fiesta!
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!
Mr. Shrek, would you sign our pitchforks?
And our torches?
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!
A real ogre?
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.
Why does being your best friend entail me doing everything I don't want to do?
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?
Could you do that ogre roar of yours for my son?
He's a big, big fan.
Do the roar.
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.
- Do the roar.
- Honey?
Why don't you go check on the cake?
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.
Hold still.
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!
Your cake. Voilà!
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!
I'm in a great mood, actually.
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!
As long as you're not doing anything, how about one of those famous Shrek roars?
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.
An ogre only roars when he's angry.
You don't want to see me angry, do you?
Do it.
Hold it together. Just hold it together.
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.
Oh, good.
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.
- You licked it!
- No.
Just because you're an ogre, doesn't mean you have to eat like one.
Looks like you forgot the candles!
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.
Watch the cake?
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.
- Ya.
- What?
No, don't cry.
Hey! I believe you promised my son a roar.
- Do the roar.
- Roar.
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.
No, I ate them.
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.
We need the cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake!
I love you, Daddy.
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.
Is this really how you want to remember the kids' first birthday?
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?
Let's talk about this after the party, at home.
You mean that roadside attraction we live in?
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!
OK, OK, maybe you're not the ogre you used to be.
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.
You spent half your life in a palace.
And the other half locked away in a tower.
Look, all I want is for things to go back to the way they used to be!
Back when villagers were afraid of me, and I could take a mud bath in peace.
When I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to do it!
Back when the world made sense!
You mean back before you rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?
Exactly!
Shrek, you have three beautiful children, a wife who loves you, friends who adore you.
You have everything.
Why is it the only person who can't see that is you?
That's just great.
If she thinks I'm gonna slink back there and apologize, she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize for acting like one.
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!
Please, help!
Please, help!
I'm stuck! Help!
Oh, please, help!
Someone, anyone! Help me!
The pain! I can see a bright light. A tunnel!
Grandma? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me, Granny.
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre, please don't eat me!
I'm not gonna eat you.
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.
Look, move out or get crushed.
So you're not gonna eat me?
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?
Nowhere.
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.
But, seriously, letme give you a ride. I insist.
Come on. It's the least I can do after all you've done for me.
I got a hot rat cooking.
AII right! Can I interest you in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?
A liquid libation to ease that frustration?
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about."
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.
To live the life of an ogre... no worries, no responsibilities.
You are free to pillage and terrorize as you please.
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?
Sometimes I wish I had just one day to feel like a real ogre again.
Why didn't you say so?
Magical transactions are my specialty!
Great. Next to mimes, magicians are my favourite people.
Hold on.
"King for a Month."
"Knight for a Week."
Ogre for a day.
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.
You'll be, like, "Roar!"
And the villagers will be, like, "Get away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"
It would be just like the good old days, when your swamp was your castle.
- When the world made sense.
- AII right, what's the catch?
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.
AII right, I knew it.
So what do you want?
- A day.
- A day.
Rat's done!
To make the magic work, you gotta give something to get something.
In this case, you gotta give a day to get a day. That's all.
I can't just pick up and leave my family.
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.
No one will even know you're gone.
And by the time this day is up, you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.
Still, I don't know.
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.
Do you like white meat or dark meat?
So what day would I have to give up?
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?
A day some meddling oaf stuck his nose where it didn't belong destroying your business and ruining your life?!
Just for an example.
How about the day I met Donkey?
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.
I don't know who that is.
I know. What about a day you wouldn't even remember?
Like a day when you were a baby.
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.
I guess there's nothing wrong with wanting a little time for myself.
Just 24 tiny little hours.
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!
I never needed to ask for anyone's permission before.
So why start now?
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it!
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!
You signed it.
So, tell me. What happens now?
Have a nice day.
I think I fell on my keys.
There are 40 children in that shoe, which is why the weasel goes pop to this very day.
Oh, great.
As we head over the river and through the woods...
Ogre!
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!
This is the part where you run away!
Sure is great to be wanted again.
Nice one.
Fiona?
Oh, no.
My home.
Fiona!
Fiona! Are you in there?!
AII right, Rumpel!
This wasn't part of the deal!
Rumpel!
Ogre!
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!
Who are you?!
What are you doing in my swamp?
Looks like a troublemaker!
Spread 'em!
Nice job, ladies!
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!
You have the right to shut your mouth!
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?
Donkey!
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.
I'm driving, so I'm in charge of the music.
Will you witches make up your mind?
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me in trouble and I need this job.
I am not going back to work for OId MacDonald.
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?
Look, I think you have me confused with some other talking donkey.
I've never seen you before in my life.
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!
And how do you know my name anyway?
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?
A donkey and an ogre friends?
That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!
Can you at least tell me where they're taking me?
To the same place they take every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!
Oh, no.
It's time to crumble!
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!
Yeah!
Gingy?
Gingy snap!
There's one!
Disgusting, filthy ogre!
Hideous monster!
Filthy, filthy creature!
Disgusting creature!
Move it!
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard on mine, Captain Crazy!
Mr. Stiltskin?
You got another customer.
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.
Bring me my business wig.
Mr. Stiltskin, please!
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!
Go away! Terms are in the details, balsa boy.
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!
Stiltskin!
Shrek!
There he is!
So close!
Have I been waiting for you!
Ladies, this is the guy that made all of this possible!
So, tell me, how are you enjoying your day?
AII right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.
Thanks to you, the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to me.
They would never do that.
They would if I promised them all their problems would disappear.
And then they disappeared!
They would have done anything if they thought it would end their daughter's curse.
I ended Fiona's curse!
How could you when you never existed?
You better start making sense, you dirty little man!
Here, letme spell it out for you!
You gave me a day from your past, a day you couldn't even remember.
A day when you were an innocent, mindless little baby.
You took the day I was born.
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin, because when this day is up...
But you haven't heard the best part.
Since you were never born, once this day comes to an end, so will you.
Where's Fiona?
Where's my family?
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?
You see, you were never born.
You never met Fiona.
Your kids don't exist.
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?
Looks like you got exactly what you wanted!
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!
Get him, witches!
You know what'd help morale around here? Flip-flop Fridays.
Feet be comfortable with the breeze on your toes.
Come on, girls!
Lock all the doors, you worthless witches! Do it!
I'll be right back, Donkey!
I don't know you! I don't know him!
I'm glad I'm not you.
Help me! Help!
Help!
No, not my pretty ball!
Watch out!
Wolfie?
My angry wig.
Help! I've been kidnapped by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!
Donkey! Get off of me!
Watch it with your pointy hooves!
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!
I'm being ass-napped!
Animal cruelty! Help!
You need to calm down!
I'm your friend.
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?
Good. I'm gonna letgo...
...right... now.
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!
Donkey! You've got to trust me.
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...
Because...
OK.
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?
I've never seen an ogre cry.
I'm not crying.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.
Just thinking about my grandma, or thinking about baby kittens, or my grandma kissing a baby kitten, or a little baby grandma kitten.
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.
It's none of my business why you're upset.
By the way, why are you upset?
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.
You signed up for one of them time-shares, huh?
No. I signed this.
You should never sign a contract with Rumpelstiltskin!
Yeah, I got that.
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.
Used to be, you had to guess his name, but now everybody knows who Rumpelstiltskin is.
Donkey, I've read the fine print.
There's nothing about an exit clause in here.
Well, you didn't expect him to make it easy for you.
Here, letme show you how it's done.
I didn't spend all that time around them witches without picking up a few tricks.
Your tiny, little ogre brain couldn't begin to comprehend the complexity of my polygonic foldability skills.
What are you doing?
Hey, I can't get my origami on unless you back off.
Thank you. OK, here's what you gotta do. You fold this piece here, make this letter match up here, bring this corner here, and if you do it just right, it will show you what to do. There!
"Try Lou's Bliss."
Who's Lou?
Give me that!
"True Love's Kiss."
You have to take me to dinner first.
"According to fairy tale law, if not fully satisfied, true love's kiss will render this contract null and void."
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?
Well, that's just it, you see.
I don't know.
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.
So... where did you leave her last?
The last time I saw her,
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!
They keep dragons in there!
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!
I'm gonna just hang back here and find us some breakfast!
Fiona!
Oh, no.
If I didn't save Fiona...
...then who did?
This is the favour Fiona was supposed to give me on the day we met.
It's a symbol of our love.
Now smell it!
Hey, man, get that dirty favour out of my face!
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife, so stop complaining and start smelling.
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog, not Donkey!
And another thing...
Wait a minute.
I think I got something.
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.
Luscious and tasty.
Hey! That's my wife you're talking about.
Donkey!
Yeah! Waffles!
And I thought the Waffle Fairy was just a bedtime story.
Sticky stacks of golden, syrupy deliciousness!
Donkey! Don't eat that!
There's a stack of freshly made waffles in the middle of the forest.
Don't you find that a wee bit suspicious?
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.
You did.
Look out!
Donkey!
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
Donkey.
Help! Help me!
Help, Shrek! Help!
Watch your head.
Hey, it's a new guy!
Look at him, all dressed up in his Sunday vest.
He's really tiny, isn't he?
Yeah. Fate has delivered us a comrade-in-arms and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!
- Hey!
- Here you go.
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?
We fight for freedom and ogres everywhere!
I didn't know we could do that.
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.
Trust me, you don't want to eat this one.
I go down smooth, but come out fighting!
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.
Your dinner is my friend!
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!
- She's back.
- There she is.
Fiona!
I'm so happy I found you!
Maybe you missed orientation, but for future reference, personal space is very important to me.
You don't know who I am, do you?
No.
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.
Gather the others and meet me in the war room.
Gretched, make sure everyone is prepared to move out tonight.
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?
OK, I know you don't remember me, but...
...we're married. Hear me out.
And at the birthday party with some pigs and a puppet, the villagers wanted me to sign their pitchforks, and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar."
Then I punched the cakes that the pigs ate and the next thing I knew, my donkey fell in your waffle hole.
Right? Who's with me?
I guess I must have kicked him harder than I thought.
Fiona, I need to...
Witches! AII right, everyone, you know the drill!
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.
Well, I see who wears the chain mail in your family!
Some people like to look at the goblet as... as half empty.
Me, I like to look at it as half full.
We've gone from the bottom to the top, ladies.
But we're not just an empire.
We're a family.
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?
Good.
Yeah, you know, we have put away a lot of ogres.
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.
It doesn't matter to me.
It's not like it's the end of the world.
Except... funny thing.
Now that I think about it, the ogre who got away is Shrek!
And if he shares a kiss with Fiona by sunrise, it is the end of the world! Our world!
My empire!
But, as I was saying,
I like to look at the goblet as half full.
Yelling makes me so parched.
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...
...of agua purificada?
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?
Well, then does anyone care to tell me what it's going to take to get this ogre? You.
Faster brooms?
- No!
- Pointier hats?
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire a professional bounty hunter?
What a world! What a world!
You know, actually not a bad idea. Baba!
I need a bounty hunter.
And if music doth soothe the savage beast...
...then I think I might know just the person!
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.
Stiltskin is leading tonight's ogre hunt himself.
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?
I bet that's because of us.
If that cupcake-eating clown finally leaves the safety of his filthy witch nest...
...he'll be vulnerable.
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route, they'll reach the river by midnight.
We'll be concealed along this road, waiting for his caravan.
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.
And then we attack!
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?
That's my chimichanga stand.
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be really hungry after this ambush, OK?
Go and finish your little speech.
AII right, as I was saying, when the smoke clears,
Rumpelstiltskin is gone and the chimichangas have been eaten.
Far Far Away will finally be free.
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.
How am I ever gonna get her to kiss me before sunrise?
Actually, I was talking about the revolution.
Revolution?
Why don't you just tell her what you told me?
About how you're her true love and you came from an alternate universe.
Well, while I'm at it, why don't I tell her that you're married to a fire-breathing dragon and you have little, mutant donkey-dragon babies.
I do?!
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.
I'm a daddy?
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...
...then I can do it again.
Shrek, do my babies have hooves or talons?
Donkey...!
Hello?
Fiona?
You should not be here, señor.
Puss?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Feed me, if you dare.
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...
-...fancy.
- Do I know you?
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?
Your wee little boots?
Boots? For a cat? Ha!
But you're Puss in Boots.
Maybe once.
But that is a name I have outgrown.
That's not the only thing you've outgrown.
Hey! I may have letmyself go a little since retirement, but hanging up my sword was the best decision of my life.
I have all the cream I can drink and all the mice I can chase.
I'll get him later.
Puss, what have I done to you?
You've gone soft.
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.
Look, it's not too late to fix it.
AII you have to do is help me get a kiss from Fiona.
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?
Well, I know how stressful mounting a rebellion can be...
...rallying the troops, planning attacks, so I brought you a little something to ease the tension.
A gift basket?
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.
Heart-shaped box of slugs.
Skunk-scented candle.
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage."
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.
Look, I don't know what this is all about, but I'm trying to run a revolution.
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,
I suggest you take your gift basket, get out of my tent and go make yourself useful!
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?
An apologetic hug?
And a quick kiss goodbye.
Hey!
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do they make people feel uncomfortable?
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?
Have the years of prim and pampery made me soft?
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?
I am.
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.
Honk.
AII right, Piggies, be gone!
Don't forget to take her little potty box with you.
This little piggy wants to go home!
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.
Pied Piper. How was your commute?
Good.
You call this guy a bounty hunter?
What's he gonna do, flute those ogres a lullaby?
OK, got it!
Make it stop!
AII right, that's enough.
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.
Griselda, seriously, it's time to pay the piper.
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!
Things are getting real sloppy around here!
Here, now make sure they eat up!
You can't end tyranny on an empty stomach! Go on! Go!
Din-din!
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?
AII right, but this is the last time.
Here it comes. Look at him.
I see you!
That's quite a friend you've got there.
I can see why you haven't eaten him.
Donkey! I hate to pull you away from your adoring public, but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.
Just another gift from some clueless lover boy.
That's a good one, Cookie!
Anyone who knows Fiona knows this stuff ain't gonna work on her.
Works on me.
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.
- To the cause!
- To the cause!
AII right!
Hello!
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes and do some scrunches before an operational... op.
This one taken?
We use that to clean the toilets.
And we use that one to clean the thing we clean the toilets with.
I knew that.
There you go, chief.
Hey... Scott?
My name is Shrek, actually.
You're going to get yourself killed at the ambush tonight.
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...
Well, let's see about that.
Hey! Hey... Hey!
What the...?
Fiona?
I got it.
Give me your hand.
The dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop and finally...
Into the castle.
Wow.
OK. Good.
It seems like you can handle yourself.
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!
AII right, let's get those axes sharpened and weapons packed!
Preparation is half the battle!
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!
Ogre, ogre, un momento!
Just give me a minute.
Look, Puss, I'm a little pressed for time.
I am not believing what I have just witnessed.
Back there, you and Fiona.
There was a spark... a spark inside her heart
I thought was long extinguished.
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!
I am her true love. I ended her curse.
You know of her curse?
By day, one way, by night another.
This shall be the norm.
Until you find true love's first kiss...
...and then take love's true form.
You even know the little rhyme!
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!
- How?
- Convince her!
Go to her when she is alone and tell her something that only her true love would know.
Know about what?!
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?
Excuse me. Coming through!
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.
Look, Donkey, the chimichanga cart! Quick!
Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!
And you are ri-donkey-lous!
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.
Secure your positions!
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!
Get back in position!
You need to know, once and for all, who I really am.
You are going to ruin everything!
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.
How do you know about my curse?!
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.
I can explain everything.
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.
Listen, I don't know who you are or how you know about my curse, but if any of these ogres find out I'm...
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.
I know everything about you.
I know you sing so beautifully that birds explode.
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?
I know that when you see a shooting star, you cross your fingers on both hands, squinch up your nose and you make a wish.
I know that you don't like the covers wrapped around your feet, and I know that you sleep by candlelight because every time you close your eyes...
...you're afraid you're gonna wake up back in that tower.
But, most importantly, Fiona...
...I know that the reason you turn human every day...
...is because you've never been kissed...
...well...
...by me.
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!
No, I can't stop myself!
Please! Make it stop!
I can't control myself!
Yeah! Cookie's bringing the heat out of the kitchen!
Oh, no! It's the Piper!
I can't believe I letthis happen, and it's all because of you!
- If you'd just letme kiss you!
- What? You're insane!
We must do something before they fandango themselves into oblivion!
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!
Then it's up to me!
Hurry! We must get them away from the music!
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?
Say what?!
No. Hell...
I don't care how big your eyes get, player, it's not going down.
AII right!
Stop!
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.
Puss, say something.
- Puss?
- Let me explain.
That's how you knew so much about me.
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?
It's the only way to save your friends.
Get out of my way.
You used to believe that a single kiss could solve everything!
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.
True love's kiss was supposed to fix everything!
Yeah, you know, that's what they told me, too.
True love didn't get me out of that tower.
I did. I saved myself.
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!
How would you know?
Did you grow up locked away in a dragon's keep?
Did you live all alone in a miserable tower?
Did you cry yourself to sleep every night, waiting for a true love that never came?!
But... But I'm your true love.
Then where were you when I needed you?
Maybe you kissed her wrong?
No.
The kiss didn't work...
...because Fiona doesn't love me.
Don't despair, fellow ogres!
They can put us in cages, but they can't cage our honour!
Shrek and Fiona are together?!
Yeah, I've heard enough of your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!
Wolfie! My speech wig.
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.
Please stay tuned for a message from our tyrannical dictator!
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...
...shepherd of your dreams.
Recently, a certain somebody has jeopardized our joyous lives.
And that somebody is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!
That is why I come to you, dear citizens.
For whomever brings me this ogre, shall receive the deal of a lifetime.
Just think of it! Total and
- complete happiness.
- Ya!
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
AII your greatest wishes.
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.
So light your torches, sharpen your pitchforks and get your mob on!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Go back where you came from!
It seems that we are safe.
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky and torchy out there. Let's go.
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.
Look, Shrek, I know things might seem a little bleak right now, but things always work themselves out in the end, you'll see.
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?
There is no tomorrow.
There's no day after that, and there's no day after that day after that!
My life was perfect and I'm never going to get it back!
If your life was so perfect, why'd you sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?
Because I didn't know what I had until it was gone! AII right?
I didn't know what I had.
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!
Gingy?
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?
Collecting my bounty!
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?
Rumpelstiltskin promised the deal of a lifetime
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?
Where all your wishes come true.
Wait a minute.
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...
Were you going to eat that?
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
AIso not Shrek.
That's not even an ogre, it is a troll! Nice try.
- And that...
- Roar.
...is just sad.
And what is that supposed to be?
I'm just a frightened old man.
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!
That is your father painted green.
No, it's Shrek! Honest!
Take them away!
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!
Stiltskin!
I hear you're looking for me.
AII right! Finally!
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?
- I do.
- What? But...
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.
That means you have to give me anything I want.
No! Only true love's kiss can break your contract!
So if you thought you were just gonna...
-...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.
Then what do you want?
The ogres. They are all free.
But where is Shrek?
This is not good.
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.
The noble Shrek turns himself in to save a bunch of filthy ogres.
AII that matters is that they're free...
...and Fiona is safe.
I bet Fiona would be really touched to hear that.
But, hey...
...I guess you can tell her yourself.
Fiona!
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!
Oh, yeah.
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.
Nobody's smart but me!
That was a really brave thing you did, Shrek.
Thank you.
No, you were right.
I wasn't there for you.
And not just at the Dragon's Keep, but...
...every day since.
Well...
...you're here now.
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!
Don't be a fool, mule!
She's right. Rumpel's palace is locked up tighter
- than OId Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded by a whole bunch of mean, ugly, nasty witches.
Hey! We can hear you!
Sorry!
We must get into the palace.
Man, Shrek and me just busted out of that place!
But how?
The same way we're gonna bust in.
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?
I guess it'll have to do.
Witches, finally, the moment we've all been waiting for.
The main event of the evening!
I present Shrek and Fiona!
And now, to put the past behind us once and for all,
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!
Fiona's old flame, the keeper of the keep...
...Dragon!
- Donkey?
- And Puss!
In Boots!
Get them, get them, witches!
Incoming!
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?
Your wife!
Uh-oh.
I'll call you! We're in love!
Fiona, hold on!
Hey, you!
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!
Jump!
Now!
The dragon goes under the bridge!
Through the loop!
And finally...
Into the castle!
Run!
Foo!
So long!
Come on, Fifi, go!
Go! Witches, close up the floor!
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!
Come on, go! FIy away! Up, up! Go!
Fifi, no!
Victory is ours!
Looks like we're having curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Hey, we make a pretty good team.
You have no idea.
Shrek?
His day is up. His day is...!
Shrek?
It's all right.
There has to be something I can do.
You've already done everything for me, Fiona.
You gave me a home and a family.
You have kids?
We have kids.
Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named...
-...Felicia.
- Felicia.
I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.
And someday...
...you will.
You know what the best part of today was?
I got the chance to fall in love with you all over again.
Fiona, the sunrise!
You're still... an ogre!
- True love's form.
- Impossible!
The kiss worked.
What?!
Fifi!
Puss!
No, no, no!
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!
I love you, Daddy!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
Fiona. I've never been better.
Roar!
Happy Birthday, Farkle.
Fergus, my little man!
And Felicia, sweetheart.
I believe this is yours.
Thank you, Daddy.
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about giving my babies an encore!
Please, señor, letus have it!
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!
You know, I always thought that I rescued you from the Dragon's Keep.
You did.
No. It was you that rescued me.
Yummy!
English .srt Subtitles
Dan4Jem, ADMMX
This is Berk.
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a few degrees south of freezing to death.
It's located solidly on the meridian of misery.
My village. In a word, sturdy.
It's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new.
We have fishing, hunting and a charming view of the sunsets.
The only problems are the pests.
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes.
We have...
...dragons.
Most people would leave. Not us.
We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.
My name is Hiccup.
Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.
Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls.
Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.
Morning!
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!
Hiccup! What is he doing?
What are you doing out?! Get inside!
That's Stoick the Vast, chief of the tribe.
When he was a baby, he popped a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.
What have we got?
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.
Good.
Hoist the torches!
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.
They wouldn't know what to do with all this.
They need toothpicks, don't they?
The meathead with attitude and interchangeable hands is Gobber.
I've been his apprentice since I was little. Well, littler.
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.
Hurry! 
See? Old village, lots and lots of new houses.
Fire!
Let's go!
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruffnut and Tuffnut...
...and...
...Astrid.
Their job is so much cooler.
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.
You've made plenty of marks, all in the wrong places.
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.
You can't even throw one of these!
OK, fine, but this will throw it for me.
See? Now this right here is what I'm talking about!
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!
If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons...
...you need to stop all this.
But you just pointed to all of me.
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.
Oh, yes.
You, sir, are playing a dangerous game.
Keeping this much raw Vikingness contained?
There will be consequences!
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...
...is everything around here.
A Nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed.
Gronckles are tough.
Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend.
A Zippleback?
Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.
They found the sheep!
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.
- Hurry up!
- Fire!
And then there's the Monstrous Nightmare.
Only the best Vikings go after those.
They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.
Reload! I'll take care of this.
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!
Get down!
Jump!
This thing never steals food, never shows itself and...
...never misses.
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.
Stay. Put. There.
You know what I mean.
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!
Let's get him!
Mind yourselves!
The devils still have some juice in them!
Come on. Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!
Did anybody see that?
Except for you.
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!
You're all out.
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know.
Sorry, Dad.
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...
Stop!
Just stop.
Every time you step outside, disaster follows.
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?
Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!
Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding.
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just kill it.
It's who I am, Dad.
You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.
Get back to the house.
Make sure he gets there.
I have his mess to clean up.
Quite the performance.
I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That helped.
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.
When he does, it's with this disappointed scowl, like someone skimped on meat in his sandwich.
"Excuse me, barmaid.
You brought me the wrong offspring.
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy arms, extra guts and glory on the side.
This here, this is a talking fishbone."
You're thinking about this wrong.
It's not so much what you look like, it's what's inside that he can't stand.
Thank you for summing that up.
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.
I just want to be one of you guys.
Either we finish them or they'll finish us!
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.
If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!
One more search before the ice sets in.
Those ships never come back.
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard. Now who's with me?!
Count me out.
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.
All right. Those who stay will look after Hiccup.
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!
That's more like it.
I'll pack my undies.
No, I need you to stay and train some new recruits.
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades, lots of time to himself.
What could possibly go wrong?
What am I going to do with him, Gobber?
Put him in training.
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.
He'd be killed before the first dragon is out of its cage.
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.
No, you don't.
Listen, you know what he's like.
From the time he could crawl, he's been... different.
He doesn't listen. He has the attention span of a sparrow.
I take him fishing and he goes hunting for trolls!
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.
But only the left ones.
What's with that?
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.
...my father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it.
I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him.
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.
That rock split in two.
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.
He could crush mountains, level forests, tame seas!
Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become.
Hiccup is not that boy.
You can't stop him, Stoick.
You can only prepare him.
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't always be around to protect him.
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.
Oh, the gods hate me.
Some people lose their knife or their mug. Not me.
I manage to lose an entire dragon.
Oh, wow. I did it.
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!
I have brought down this mighty beast!
I'm going to kill you, dragon.
Then I'll cut out your heart and take it to my father.
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!
I did this.
Hiccup.
Dad...
...I have to talk to you, Dad.
I need to speak with you, too, son.
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.
- What?
- What?
- You go first.
- No, you go first.
All right.
You get your wish. Dragon training... you start in the morning.
Oh, man, I should have gone first.
I was thinking, you know, we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?
You'll need this.
I don't want to fight dragons.
Come on. Yes, you do.
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.
But you will kill dragons.
No, I'm really very extra-sure that I won't.
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?
This is serious, son.
When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you.
Which means you walk like us, you talk like us...
...you think like us.
No more of... this.
You just gestured to all of me.
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.
Deal?
Deal.
Good.
Train hard.
I'll be back. Probably.
And I'll be here.
Maybe.
Welcome to dragon training!
No turning back.
I hope I get some serious burns.
I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or back.
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.
Yeah, no kidding, right?
Pain. Love it.
Oh, great. Who let him in?
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him?
Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?
Don't worry. You're small and weak... that'll make you less of a target.
They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.
Behind these doors are just a few of the many species you will learn to fight!
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.
The Hideous Zippleback.
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.
Can you stop that?!
And the Gronckle.
Jaw strength 8.
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?
I believe in learning on the job.
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...
...you're dead!
What's the first thing you'll need?
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!
Your most important piece of equipment is your shield!
If you must choose between a sword or a shield, take the shield!
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!
Take that one. It has a flower... girls like flowers.
Oops, this one has blood on it.
- Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?
Shields are good for another thing.
Noise! Make lots of it to throw off a dragon's aim!
All dragons have a limited number of shots.
How many does a Gronckle have?
- Five?
- No, six!
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!
Fishlegs, out!
Hiccup, get in there!
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.
You look like you work out.
Snotlout! You're done!
So it's just you and me, huh?
Nope, just you.
One shot left!
Hiccup!
And that's six.
Go back to bed, you overgrown sausage!
You'll get another chance, don't you worry.
Remember, a dragon will always, always go for the kill.
So... why didn't you?
This was stupid.
Why don't you just fly away?
All right, where did Astrid go wrong in the ring today?
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."
She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves.
Where did Hiccup go wrong?
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.
He's never where he should be.
Thank you, Astrid.
You need to live and breathe this stuff. The dragon manual.
Everything we know about every dragon we know of.
No attacks tonight. Study up.
Wait, you mean read?
While we're still alive?
Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face. And there's this other one...
Yeah. That sounds great.
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.
Another one has spines like trees.
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...
...tomorrow.
Dragon classifications.
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.
When startled, the Thunderdrum produces a concussive sound that can kill a man at close range.
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
Timberjack. This gigantic creature has razor-sharp wings that can slice through full-grown trees.
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its victim. Extremely dangerous.
Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.
Burns its victims. Buries its victims.
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.
Night Fury.
Speed unknown. Size unknown.
The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself.
Never engage this dragon.
Your only chance: Hide and pray it does not find you.
I can almost smell them.
They're close.
Steady.
Take us in.
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.
Hard to port!
Steady!
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies.
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?
Focus, Hiccup!
You're not even trying!
Today it's all about attack!
Nadders are quick and light on their feet.
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!
I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods!
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.
Find it, hide in it and strike!
Do you ever bathe?
If you don't like it, then just get your own blind spot.
How about I give you one?
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.
Hey, so, how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?
No one's ever met one and lived to tell the tale. Get in there!
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!
Get down.
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.
What do you want me to do, block out the sun?
I could do that but I don't have time!
They probably...
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.
Has anyone ever seen one napping?
Hiccup!
Love on the battlefield.
She could do better.
Let me... Why don't you?
Well done, Astrid.
Is this some kind of a joke to you?
Our parents' war is about to become ours.
Figure out which side you're on.
Toothless.
I could have sworn you had...
...teeth.
No, no, no.
I don't have any more!
And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole!
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.
He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg.
Isn't it weird to think your hand was inside a dragon?
Like if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed the dragon from inside by crushing his heart.
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.
It's the wings and the tails you really want.
If it can't fly, it can't get away.
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.
Tomorrow we get to the big boys, slowly but surely making our way up to the Monstrous Nightmare.
But who'll win the honor of killing it?
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?
Your mom let you get a tattoo?
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.
OK, I've been stuck with you since birth, and that was never there before.
Yes, it was. You've just never seen me from the left side.
Hey, Toothless.
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.
OK, that's disgusting.
We've got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod...
...and a whole smoked eel.
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.
Yeah, I don't really like eel much, either.
That's it.
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.
It's OK.
OK.
That's not too bad. It works.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my! It's working!
Yes, yes! I did it!
Yeah!
Today is about teamwork.
Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire.
The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky.
One head breathes gas, the other head lights it.
Your job is to know which is which.
Razor-sharp serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion.
Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims...
Will you please stop that?!
If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna...
There!
Hey, it's us, idiots!
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.
Not that there's anything wrong with a dragonesque figure.
Wait.
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!
Chances of survival are dwindling to single digits now.
Wrong head.
Fishlegs!
Now, Hiccup!
Oh, come on.
Hiccup!
Back, back, back!
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got some things I need to...
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.
Meet the Terrible Terror.
It's like the size of my...
Get it off!
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!
Wow! He's better than you ever were.
Oh, great.
Hiccup.
Hiccup? Are you in there?
Astrid. Hey.
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.
I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird.
Well, weirder.
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.
Excellent.
I hope you had more success than me.
Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over, yes.
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!
Out with the old and in with the new, right?
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!
- Come over here.
- Hurry!
He's gone?
Most afternoons, but who can blame him? The life of a celebrity's rough.
He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans.
Hiccup?
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.
Here we go. Here we go. Position...
...three... no, four.
All right, it's go time. It's go time.
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!
Yes, it worked!
Sorry!
It was my fault.
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four.
Three.
Yeah! Go, baby!
Yes!
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!
Stop!
No!
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!
All right, OK, you've gotta kind of angle yourself.
OK, no, no, no. Come back down towards me! Come back down...
Yeah!
Come on.
No, thanks. I'm good.
Not so fireproof on the inside, are you?
Here you go.
Everything we know about you guys is wrong.
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...
I know.
- I came looking for you.
- You did?
You've been keeping secrets.
I have?
Just how long did you think you could hide it?
I don't know what you're...
Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it.
So...
...let's talk...
...about that dragon.
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.
I just didn't know how to...
You're not upset?
What?! I was hoping for this!
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!
Wait till you spill a Nadder's guts the first time!
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.
And all the while you were holding out on me!
Oh, Thor Almighty!
With you doing so well in the ring...
...we finally have something to talk about.
Here, I brought you something, to keep you safe in the ring.
Wow. Thanks.
Your mother would have wanted you to have it. It's half of her breastplate.
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.
Thanks for stopping by...
...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.
Well... Yep. Good night.
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.
Please, by all means.
This time, this time for sure!
No! No, son of a half-troll,
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.
- So, later.
- Not so fast.
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!
Late for what, exactly?
Quiet down! The elder has decided.
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!
That's my boy!
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...
...leaving! We're leaving.
Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.
Forever.
Oh, man.
What the?!
What are you doing here?
I want to know what's going on.
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?
Training?
It better not involve this.
I know this looks really bad, but you see...
You're right. You're right.
You're right.
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.
Why would you do that?!
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.
Oh, man.
Get down!
Run, run!
It's OK! It's OK.
She's a friend.
You just scared him.
I scared him?!
Who is "him"?
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.
We're dead.
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!
Hiccup, get me down from here!
You have to give me a chance to explain.
I am not listening to anything you have to say!
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.
Please, Astrid.
Now get me down.
Toothless, down. Gently.
See? Nothing to be afraid of.
Toothless!
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!
And now the spinning.
Thank you for nothing, you useless reptile.
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.
Just get me off of this thing.
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.
It's amazing.
He's amazing.
So what now?
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.
You know you'll have to kill...
...kill a dragon.
Don't remind me.
Toothless, what's happening?
What is it?
Get down!
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Toothless, you gotta get us out of here, bud.
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.
What does that make us?
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.
It's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.
They're not eating any of it.
What is that?
All right, bud, we got to get out of here... now!
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.
They're the workers and that's their queen.
It controls them. Let's find your dad.
No! No.
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.
We have to think this through carefully.
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest, the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here, and you want to keep it a secret?
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?
Yes.
OK. Then what do we do?
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.
OK.
That's for kidnapping me.
That's for everything else.
What are you looking at?
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!
I can show my face in public again!
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks
Hiccup would go from, well, being Hiccup to placing first in dragon training, well, I would have tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear he'd gone mad!
And you know it!
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised or more proud than I am.
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.
Today, he becomes one of us!
Be careful with that dragon.
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?
Put an end to this. I have to try.
Astrid, if something goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless.
I will. Just promise me it won't go wrong.
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!
I would have gone for the hammer.
I'm ready.
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!
What is he doing?
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.
I'm not one of them.
What's he thinking?
- Stop the fight.
- No!
I need you all to see this.
They're not what we think they are.
We don't have to kill them.
I said, stop the fight!
Out of my way!
Hiccup!
This way!
Night Fury!
Toothless, go. Get out of here.
Go, go!
Stoick, no!
Dad, he won't hurt you!
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!
Toothless, stop!
No! No!
Get him!
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!
Please don't hurt him.
Put it with the others.
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.
- Dad?
- We had a deal!
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.
So everything in the ring, a trick? A lie?
I screwed up. I should have told you before now. I just...
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please, just don't hurt Toothless.
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?
Not the people you almost killed?
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.
They've killed hundreds of us!
And we've killed thousands of them!
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.
If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves.
There's something else on their island. It's a dragon like...
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.
Only a dragon can find the island.
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.
Dad, please. I promise you, you can't win this one!
No, Dad. No.
For once in your life, would you please just listen to me?!
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.
You're not my son.
Ready the ships!
This way.
Set sail!
We head for Helheim's Gate.
Lead us home, devil.
It's a mess.
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:
Your father, your tribe, your best friend.
Thank you for summing that up.
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods?
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.
So why didn't you?
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.
Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?
Because I want to remember what you say right now.
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.
You said "wouldn't".
Whatever! I wouldn't!
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.
First one to ride one, though.
So?
I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.
I looked at him and I saw myself.
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.
Then something crazy.
That's more like it.
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.
- Here!
- One length to your stern.
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some of the men and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here. Not me, of course.
I know you're always the man with the plan. But some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.
Of course. Send them running.
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.
Step aside.
Bear to port.
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.
You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.
It's me.
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...
You're crazy. I like that.
So, what is the plan?
That's not really encouraging.
I was wondering where that went.
Stay low and ready your weapons.
We're here.
- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.
It's OK. It's OK.
Where are you going?
You'll need something to help you hold on.
When we crack this mountain open, all hell is going to break loose.
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.
No matter how this ends, it ends today.
Is that it?
We've done it!
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!
Get clear!
Beard of Thor! What is that?!
Odin help us.
Catapults!
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.
Lead the men to the far side of the island!
Gobber, go with the men!
I think I'll stay, in case your thinking of doing something crazy.
I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing someone to hunt!
Then I can double that time.
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!
Come on! Fight me!
No, me!
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!
Move, Fishlegs!
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!
Up! Let's move it!
Every bit the boar-headed stubborn Viking you ever were!
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.
Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing!
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!
OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind spot, make noise, keep it confused!
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!
That's my specialty!
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!
- Troll!
- Butt elf!
Bride of Grendel!
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!
There!
Go help the others!
OK, hold on. Hold on.
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!
I'm OK!
Less OK!
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?
Yeah! You're the Viking!
Dad?
You got it, bud.
Hiccup!
I'm sorry... for everything.
Yeah. Me, too.
You don't have to go up there.
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.
I'm proud to call you my son.
Thanks, Dad.
He's up!
Get Snotlout out of there.
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.
No, this way.
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!
I can't believe that worked!
Night Fury!
Get down!
Did you get her?
Go.
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!
You think that did it?
Well, he can fly.
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.
Come on, bud!
Here it comes!
Watch out!
OK, time's up! Let's see if this works.
Come on! Is that the best you can do?!
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.
Hold, Toothless.
Now!
No.
No!
Hiccup!
Son!
Hiccup.
Oh, son.
I did this.
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.
Hiccup!
He's alive.
You brought him back alive.
Thank you for saving my son.
Well, you know... most of him.
Hey, Toothless.
I'm happy to see you, too.
I'm in my house.
You're in my house.
Does my dad know you're here?
What? OK, OK.
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.
Toothless! Oh, come on.
OK. Thanks, bud.
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!
Hold on tight! Here we go!
What?
I knew it. I'm dead.
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!
It's Hiccup!
Turns out all we needed was a little more of this.
You just gestured to all of me.
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?
I might make a few tweaks.
That's for scaring me.
What is it always going to be this way? 'Cause...
...I could get used to it.
Welcome home.
- Night Fury!
- Get down!
You ready?
This is Berk.
It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three.
Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless.
The people that grow here are even more so.
The only upsides are the pets.
While other places have ponies or parrots...
...we have...
...dragons.
Aah!
Wee-be-be-bee.
Will you take a look at that?
Pretty pathetic, huh?
Well, you'll never believe this, but that llama you're looking at was once a human being
And not just any human being
That guy was an emperor
A rich, powerful ball of charisma
Oh, yeah!
This is his story
Well, actually my story
That's right--
I'm that llama
The name is Kuzco
Emperor Kuzco
I was the world's nicest guy, and they ruined my life for no reason
Oh, is that hard to believe?
Look, I tell you what
You go back away-- you know, before
I was a llama, and this will all make sense
All right, now see, that's a little too far back
Oh, ho! Look at me!
That's me as a baby
Waah!
Ahem! All right, let' smove ahead
Oh, yeah.
Theme song guy: There are despots and dictators
Political manipulators
There are blue bloods with the intellects of fleas
There are kings and catty tyrants
Who are so lacking in refinements
They'd be better suited swinging from the trees
He was born and raised to rule
No one has ever been as cool
In a thousand years of aristocracy
An enigma and a mystery
In Mesoamerican history
The quintessence of perfection that is he
Ok, this is the real me
Not this
- This
- Not this.
- Winner!
- Loser.
Ok, see this palace?
Everyone in it is at my command
Check this out
Butler.
Chef.
Theme song guy.
Oh, yeah!
He's the sovereign lord of the nation
He's the hippest cat in creation
He's the alpha, the omega, A to Z
And this perfect world will spin
Around his every little whim
'Cause this perfect world begins and ends with
Me.
What's his name?
Kuzco
That's his name
Kuzco
He's the king of the world
Kuzco
Is he hip or what?
Kuzco
Yeah
Gow!
You threw off my groove!
I'm sorry, but you've thrown off the emperor's groove.
Sorry!
You were saying?
What's his name?
Kuzco
Kuzco
That's his name
Is he hip or what?
Don't you know he's the king of the world?
Whoa, yeah
Oww!
Ha!
Boom, baby!
Aah! Your Highness, it is time for you to choose your bride.
Allrighty
Trot out the ladies
Let's take a look-see.
Hate your hair.
Not likely.
Yikes, yikes, yikes, and let me guess.
You have a great personality.
Is this really the best you could do?
Oh, yes. Oh, no.
I mean, perhaps--
What is he babbling about?
He's like the thing that wouldn't shut up
Anyway, still wondering about that llama in the opening?
Well, let me show you the people responsible for ruining my life
First, there's Pacha
Uh, excuse me.
I'm here to see
Emperor Kuzco.
You see,
I got this summons--
Inside, up the stairs, and to the left
Just follow the signs
Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.
Uh, and don't be fooled by the folksy peasant look
Oh!
Pardon me
That's mine
Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Aah! Oh, hey.
Are you all right?
Here. Let me, uh--
Oh, you're so very kind.
What happened?
Well, I...
I threw off the emperor's groove.
- What?
- His groove!
The rhythm in which he lives his life, his pattern of behavior.
I threw it off, and the emperor had me thrown out the window.
Oh, really?
I'm supposed to see him today.
Don't throw off his groove!
Oh, ok.
Beware the groove.
Hey, are you gonna be all right?
Groove.
Kuzco: You see what I mean?
This guy's trouble, but as bad as he is, he is nothing compared to what's coming up next
And why have you come here today?
Well
Your Highness--
I mean, Your Grace.
Ok, gang
Check out this piece of work
This is Yzma, the emperor's advisor-- living proof that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man
Every decade or so she gets a new one
This year's model is called Kronk
Yeah, I got that there, Yzma.
Unh!
Yep, that's Kronk
Now lately, Yzma's gotten into this bad habit of trying to run the country behind my back, and I’m thinkin' that's got to stop
It is no concern of mine whether your family has...
What was it again?
Um, food.
Ha! You really should have thought of that before you became peasants.
We're through here.
Take him away. Next!
But l--
Oh, ok.
Ugh.
The nerve of some of those peasants, huh?
Tell me about it.
Aah!
Hi there.
Ooh, Your Highness.
Ahem.
Oh, oh, oh, ha ha ha. Um...
Uh, you were doing it again.
Doing? Doing...
Doing what?
Doing my job.
I'm the emperor, and you're the emperor's advisor.
Remember that?
But, Your Highness,
I was only dealing with meaningless peasant matters.
Whoa
Look at these wrinkles
What is holding this woman together?
What the--
How long has that been there?
Good thinkin', Yzma
What do you say,
Kuzco?
Whoa! No touchy!
No touchy.
No touch.
Excuse me,
Your Highness
The village leader is here to see you.
Oh, great.
Send him in.
Oh, and by the way, you're fired.
Fired?
W-W-What do you mean, fired?
Um, how else can I say it?
You're being let go, your department's being downsized, you're part of an outplacement, we're going in a different direction, we're not picking up your option...
Take your pick.
I got more.
But l-- You--uh--
Uhh.
But--
But, Your Highness,
I have been nothing if not loyal to the empire for--for--for many, many years.
Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride.
You just hit yours
50 years ago.
So...who's in my chair?
Oh, oh! I know!
Yzma.
Yzma's in your chair, right?
Very good, Kronk.
Here. Get the snack.
Got it!
Unh! Oof!.
Ok, you heard the man.
Up, up, up.
I’m ok
I'm fine
Ah. ok. Show him in.
Ahem.
Uh, afternoon,
Your Highness.
I'm here because
I received a summons--
Hey, there he is!
My main village man.
Um, Pacha.
Anyway, I got this summons--
Pacha.
That's right.
You are just the man
I wanted to see.
I am?
Word on the street is you can fix my problem.
You can fix my problem, can't you?
Sure.
I'll do what I can.
Good, good. That's just what I wanted to hear.
Are you aware of just how important your village is to the empire?
Well, I know we grow the crops that you use here at the palace.
We also herd the llamas that you--
My village?
Oh, yeah.
You got a pretty sweet little setup there on top of that hill, don't you? Ha ha ha!
Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop for the last
6 generations.
Uh-huh.
So tell me, where do you find you get the most sun?
Oh, I'd say just on the other side of those trees.
When the sun hits that ridge just right, these hills sing.
Well, that settles it.
Really?
Yep. Problem solved.
Thanks for coming.
That's it?
That's all you wanted me for?
I just needed an insider's opinion before I ok'd this spot for my pool.
Uh...your pool?
Boo-yah!
Welcome to
Kuzcotopia, my ultimate summer getaway complete with water slide.
What?
Isn't it great?
It's my birthday gift to me. Ha!
I'm so happy.
Uh...uh... um...l don't understand how this could happen.
Well, let me clear it up for you.
At my birthday celebration tomorrow,
I give the word, and your town will be destroyed to make way for this...
So, if I were you,
I'd pick up some change-of-address forms on the way home.
But, um, where will we live?
Hmm...
Don't know, don't care.
How's that?
Oh, but wait.
You can't--
When I give the word, your little town thingy will be bye-bye.
Bye-bye!
Oh, w--wait. No--
Heh heh. Boohoo.
Oh, yeah
Everything was goin' my way
Or so I thought
He can't get rid of me that easily.
Who does that ungrateful little worm think he is?
Does he...
A little to the left.
...have any idea of who he's dealing with?
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.
Yeah, you think he would've turned out better.
Yeah, go figure.
Well, it's better you're takin' out your anger on these things instead of the real Kuzco, huh?
That's it, Kronk!
- That's it!
I'll get rid of Kuzco.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
The real Kuzco?
Of course the real Kuzco.
Don't you see?
It's perfect.
With him out of the way and no heir to the throne,
I'll take over and rule the empire.
Brilliant!
So how does that work with you bein' fired and all?
The only ones who know about that are the three of us, soon to be the two of us.
And I'm one of those two, right?
To the secret lab!
Pull the lever, Kronk.
Wrong lever!
Huh?
Why do we even have that lever?
Get out of my way!
Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times
Whee!
Faster, faster!
Yzma, put your hands in the air!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Ah, how shall I do it?
Oh, I know.
I'll turn him into a flea, a harmless little flea, and then I'll put that flea in a box, and then I'll put that box inside of another box, and then I'll mail that box to myself, and when it arrives,
Ah ha ha ha!
I'll smash it with a hammer!
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you!
Genius, I say!
Or, to save on postage,
I'll just poison him with this.
Take it, Kronk.
Oh ho ho ho.
Feel the power.
Oh...
I can feel it.
Our moment of triumph approaches.
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
It's dinner time.
So...is everything ready for tonight?
Oh, yeah. I thought we'd start off with soup and a light salad and then see how we feel after that.
Not the dinner...
The you know.
Oh, right.
The poison--
The poison for Kuzco, the poison chosen specially to kill Kuzco,
Kuzco's poison.
That poison?
Yes! That poison.
Got you covered.
Excellent.
A few drops in his drink, then I'll propose a toast, and he will be dead before dessert.
Which is a real shame, because it's gonna be delicious.
Boom, bam, baby!
Let's get to the grub
I am one hungry king of the world.
So...no hard feelings about being let go?
None whatsoever.
Kronk, get the emperor a drink.
Drink. Right.
Your Highness.
Is something burning?
My spinach puffs!
Ahem.
So... he seems... nice.
Heh. He is.
He's what, in his late twenties?
Heh heh. I'm not sure.
Saved 'em!
- That's great.
- Yzma: Great!
- Good job.
- Very good job.
Watch it.
They're still hot.
Ahem.
Ahem!
Heh heh heh.
Kronk.
The emperor needs his... drink.
Right. Oh. Right.
Hey, Kronky, everything ok back there?
Well, heh.
Oh, uh...
Ooh. The drinks were a bit on the... hmm... oh...ugh...warm side.
Heh heh.
Hey, did you see that sky today?
Talk about blue.
Ha ha ha.
Yes, Kronk.
Riveting.
A toast to the emperor!
Long live Kuzco!
Don't drink the wine.
Poison.
Ah! Tasty.
Finally!
Ha ha ha!
Good work,
Kronk.
Oh, they're so easy to make.
I'll get you the recipe.
Now to get rid of the body.
Ok! What were we saying?
Uh...we were just making a toast
Yzma: to your long and healthy rule
Right. So what are you gonna do?
I mean, you've been around here a long time, and I really mean a long time. Um...
Ahem.
It might be difficult for someone of your age adjusting to life in the private sector.
Hey, Kronk, can you top me off, pal?
Be a friend? Heh heh.
Now, about you finding new work
Hit him on the head. that's--that's gonna be tough
More broccoli?
Because you're you know
Let's face it
You're no spring chicken, and I mean that in the best possible way.
What? A llama?
He's supposed to be dead!
Yeah, weird.
Let me see that vial.
This isn't poison.
This is extract of llama. Ugh!
You know, in my defense, your poisons all look alike.
You might think about re labeling some of them.
Take him out of town and finish the job now!
What about dinner?
Kronk, this is kind of important.
How about dessert?
Well, I suppose there's time for dessert.
And coffee?
All right.
A quick cup of coffee.
Then take him out of town and finish the job!
Cha cha cha cha
Guess where I am right now
Uh-huh. In the bag
Still think I'm not the victim here?
Watch. It gets better.
Hey! Ba-da ba-da ba-da-da
Ugh, he's doing his own theme music?
Ba-da ba-da ba-da ba
Ba-da-ba
Gig, dumb, and tone deaf
I am so glad I was unconscious for all of this
Huhh!
Mission accomplished.
You're not just gonna let him die like that, are you?
My shoulder angel.
Don't listen to that guy
He's trying to lead you down the path of righteousness.
I'm gonna lead you down the path that rocks.
Oh, come off it.
You come off it!
- You.
- You.
- You.
- You infinity.
Uhh!
Listen up, big guy.
I got 3 good reasons why you should just walk away.
" Number one..."
Look at that guy!
He's got that sissy stringy music thing.
We've been through this.
It's a harp, and you know it.
Oh, right.
That's a harp... and that's a dress.
Robe!
Reason number 2.
Look what
I can do.
Ha ha ha!
But... what does that have to do with anything?
No, no.
He's got a point.
Listen, you guys.
You're sort of confusing me, so be gone!
Uh, or, uh, you know.
However I get rid of you guys.
That'll work.
Um, what's with the chimp and the bug?
Can we get back tome?
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.
What to do, what to do?
What do we do with the body?
What am I gonna tell the village?
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. ok.
What do I do? What do I do?
- Aah!
Back!
Elbow! Shoulder!
- Unh!
Oh. Hey! Hey, you!
Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
Comin' through.
Hey, you with the cart!
Uh-oh
This is not good.
Uhh. Hope that doesn't come back to haunt me.
Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!
Measure me again!
Ha!
All right, Tipo.
Stand still and let's see.
Mom, you and I both know that it's impossible for him to have grown in the last 5 minutes.
Mmm! Mmm!
Isn't it?
Look how much you've grown!
What? Tipo, get out of the way.
It's my turn again.
Measure me.
Dad's home!
Hey, ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Come here
Ha ha ha!
Dad! I ate a bug today!
Oh! Was Mom baking again?
Heh. Don't tell her
I said that.
I heard that.
Ok, everybody, move aside
Lady with a baby comin' through.
Dad, Dad, Dad!
Look at how big I am!
We were all measured today.
Oh.
I'm going through a growth spurt.
I'm as big as you were when you were me.
Mm-hmm. Sure are.
That's not as impressive as my loose tooth. See?
Ok, ok, you two.
Our deal was that you could stay awake until Daddy came home.
Now say good night.
Dad, do we have to?
No, you two can stay up.
We're just gonna be sittin' here tellin' each other how much we love each other.
Right, honey?
- Ew!
- Blecch!
Good night.
So what did the emperor want?
Ahem.
You know what?
He couldn't see me.
Couldn't see you?
- Why not?
- I don't know.
Well, that's just rude.
Well, he is the emperor.
I'm sure he's busy.
No, no, no, no. No.
Emperor or no emperor, it's called common courtesy.
Honey...
If that were me,
I'd march right back there and demand to see him, and you know I would.
Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby.
Pacha, I'm fine.
This baby's not coming for a while, but even if it was,
I'd give that guy a piece of my mind.
That kind of behavior just--just--
Uhh!
I gotta go wash something.
Pacha?
You ok?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah. I'm just a little tired from the trip.
Um...I’m gonna go put Misty away.
Uh, heh heh. Hi.
Excuse me.
2 seconds here.
Um, I'm the one in the cart. Remember?
This story's about me, not him. ok. You got it?
All right.
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.
Heh heh heh.
Huh?
Whoa.
Uhh. Oh.
Where'd you come from, little guy?
No touchy.
Aah! Demon llama!
Demon llama? Where?
- Aah!
- Aah!
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Ooh hoo hoo!
Ow! Ow, my head.
Ok, demon llama.
Just take it easy.
I mean you no harm.
What are you talking about--
Oh, wait. I know you.
You're that whiny peasant.
Emperor Kuzco?
Yeah. Who do you think you were talkin' to?
Uh...how did--
Um... you don't... look like the emperor.
What do you mean I don't look like the emperor?
Uh...oh... do this...
What is this, some kind of little game you country folk like to--
Aah! It can't be! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
My face! Aah! My beautiful, beautiful face!
Ok, ok, ok.
I'm an ugly, stinky llama!
Wait, ok,
Your Majesty.
- Llama face!
- Shh!
What happened?
I'm tryin' to figure that out, ok?
Ohh-ho!
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.
Wait a minute.
I remember you.
I remember telling you that I was building my pool where your house was, and then you got mad at me.
Ohh!
And you turned me into a llama!
What? No, I did not.
Yes, and then you kidnapped me.
Why would I kidnap a llama?
I have no idea.
You're the criminal mastermind, not me.
What?
Hmm. You're right.
That's giving you way too much credit. ok. I have to get back to the palace.
Yzma's got that "secret lab."
I'll just snap my fingers and order her to change me back.
Hey, you.
No time to waste.
Let's go.
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this body.
Wouldn't you?
Now let's go.
Build your summerhouse somewhere else.
You want to run that by me again?
I can't let you go back unless you change your mind and build your summer home somewhere else.
Hmm. I got a little secret for you.
Come here.
No, closer.
I don't make deals with peasants!
Then I guess I can't take you back.
Fine.
I don't need you.
I can find my own way back.
I wouldn't recommend it.
It's a little dangerous if you don't know the way.
Nice try, pal.
No, really.
I'm telling you,
There are jaguars and snakes and quicksand
I'm not listening.
I'm not kidding.
Listen, you cannot go in there.
La la la la
Oh. Heh heh.
Still not listening.
Aw, you...
Fine. Fine.
Go ahead!
If there's no Kuzco, there's no Kuzcotopia.
Takes care of my problem.
Hmm.
Scary jungle.
Right.
Ooh, a leaf.
Ooh, it might attack me.
Oh, it's a scary tree.
I'm afraid. Ha ha.
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor, and as such,
I'm born with an innate sense of direction.
Ok, where am I?
Wha--
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Uhh.
Too late.
Ok, that was the freakiest thing I've ever seen.
Aah!
Hmm.
What do you want?
Oh, for me?
Why, I don't know what to say.
Ow!
Hit the road, bucky.
Aah! Ow!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Uh-oh.
No, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
No, don't.
Ha!
Aah!
No!
Aah!
Aah!
You killer jaguars...
Whoa!
Aah-eee!
Aah!
Aah!
Yee-aah!
Aah!
Don't worry,
Your Highness. I gotcha.
You're safe now.
Maybe I'm just new to this whole rescuing thing, but this, to me, might be considered kind of a step backwards, wouldn't you say?
No, no, no.
It's--It's ok.
This--This is all right.
We can figure this out.
I hate you.
- No!
- Yaah!
Aah! Ow!
Whoo hoo hoo!
Aah!
Ow!
Ow!
Uhh!
I don't know about you, but I'm getting all funned out.
Uh-oh.
Don't tell me.
We're about to go over a huge waterfall.
- Yep.
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?
Most likely.
Bring it on.
Boo-yah!
Whoo!
Your Highness.
Your Highness, can you hear me?
Oh, boy.
Come on, breathe.
Breathe!
Ohh. Why me?
Ooh!
All right.
- Ohh!
- Aah!
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
For the last time, it was not a kiss.
Well, whatever you call it... it was disgusting.
And if you would've done what I ordered you to do in the first place, we all could've been spared your little kiss of life.
Aw!
But now that you're here, you will take me back to the palace.
I'll have Yzma change me back, and then I'll start construction on Kuzcotopia.
Oh, yeah.
Ok, now, look,
I think we got off on the wrong foot here.
Mm-hmm.
I just think if you really thought about it, you'd decide to build your home on a different hilltop.
And why would I do that?
Because... deep down,
I think you'll realize that you're forcing an entire village out of their homes just for you.
And that's... bad?
Well, yeah.
Nobody's that heartless.
Mmm.
Now take me back.
What?
Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?
All you care about is building your summer home and filling it with stuff for you.
Uh, yeah. Doh.
Me.
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.
You're the only one that doesn't seem to be with the program, eh, Pacha?
You know what?
Someday, you're going to wind up all alone, and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.
Thanks for that.
I'll log that away.
Now, for the final time,
I order you to take me back to the palace.
Looks to me like you're stuck out here, because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.
Because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.
Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.
Huh? What?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't--
Somebody's throwing stuff.
You going to build a fire or what? What's going on?
He's never going to change his mind.
Ohh. How am I ever going to get out of here?
And so, it is with great sadness that we mourn the sudden departure of our beloved prince... taken from us so tragically on the very eve of his 18th birthday.
Poor little guy.
His legacy will live on in our hearts...
He never had a chance. for all eternity.
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.
Back to work.
Kronk, darlin',
I must admit you had me worried when you mixed up those poisons, but now that
Kuzco is dead, all is forgiven.
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's...
Heh. He's dead, all right. Heh heh.
I mean, you can't get much deader than he-- than he is right now.
Unless, of course, we killed him again.
I suppose.
Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.
Kronk...
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.
Kronk...
I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist.
Kuzco is dead, right?
Tell me Kuzco's dead.
I need to hear these words.
Do you need to hear all those words exactly?
He's still alive?
Well, he's not as dead as we would've hoped.
Kronk...
I just thought
I'd give you the heads-up in case Kuzco ever came back.
He can't come back!
Yeah. That would be kind of awkward-- especially after that lovely eulogy.
You think?
You and I are going out to find him.
If he talks, we are through!
Now let's move!
Dad, look out!
Tipo, what is it?
I had a dream that
Dad was tied to a log and was careening out of control down a raging river of death!
All right, all right, it's ok.
- It was awful!
- Shh!
It's ok, it's ok.
Tipo, calm down.
It was just a dream.
Your dad's fine.
He just went back to see the emperor.
Oh. Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.
That's right.
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.
Yeah, like that would ever happen.
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.
Yeah-huh.
Good night, you two.
- Night, Mom!
- Night, Mom!
- Yeah-huh. Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.
Ooh!
B-B-Brr!
Uh, hey
Thanks.
Oh.
No problem.
Feels like wool.
Yeah.
Alpaca?
Oh, yeah, it is.
Oh, yeah,
I thought so.
It's nice.
My wife made it.
Oh, she knits?
Crochets.
Crochets?
Nice.
Thanks.
So...
So, I was thinking that when I got back to the city, we'd, uh...
I mean, there's lots of hilltops, and maybe I might, you know...
I--I might...
Are you saying... you've changed your mind?
Oh, well, l--I...
Because you know that means you're doing something nice for someone else.
No, I know that.
I know.
And you're all right with that?
Yes.
What?
Don't shake unless you mean it.
All right.
Let's get you back to the palace.
Oh, by the way, thanks.
No... thank you ok.
Once we cross this bridge, it's only an hour to the palace.
Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.
I believe it.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
Ohh!
Whoa!
Kuzco!
Kuzco!
- Yeah?
- Quick, help me up!
No. I don't think
I will.
You're going to leave me here?
Well, I was going to have you imprisoned for life, but I kind of like this better.
I thought you were a changed man.
Oh, come on.
I had to say something to get you to take me back to the city.
So all of it was a lie?
Well, yeah.
No, wait.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It all was a lie.
Toodles.
We shook hands on it!
You know, the funny thing about shaking hands is... you need hands.
Ha! ok.
Buh-bye.
Aah!
Are you ok?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah. I think
I'm all right.
Good!
That's for going back on your promise!
Yii!
Yeah. That's for kidnapping me and taking me to your village... which I'm still gonna destroy, by the way.
Ah ha ha ha!
No touchy.
Ooh!
Why did I risk my life for a selfish brat like you?
I was always taught that there was some good in everyone, but, ooh, you proved me wrong.
Oh, boohoo.
Now I feel really bad.
Bad llama.
I could've let you die out there in that jungle, and then all my problems would be over.
Well, that makes you ugly and stupid.
Let's end this.
Ladies first.
- Aah! - Yaah!
Ohh!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!
- Whoa!
- Ohh!
What are we gonna do?
Aah!
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
That's it for me!
No, we're not
Calm down.
I have an idea.
Give me your arm.
Ok, now the other one.
When I say go, push against my back, and we'll walk up the hill.
Ready?
Go.
Ow!
You did that on purpose.
- Aah!
- No, I didn't!
Now, we're gonna have to work together to get out of this, so follow my lead.
Ready?
- Right foot.
- Whose right?
Your right or mine?
I don't care.
Mine.
Well, why yours?
Ok, your right!
Ready?
Ok, got it.
Ok, right.
Left. Right.
Ha ha!
Look, we're moving!
Aah!
Don't look down!
Now, stay with me.
Stay with me.
Right. Left.
Right. Left.
Right. Left.
Right!
Now what, genius?
Working on it.
Ok, here's the deal.
Stretch out your neck, and I'll grab the rope.
How do I know you won't let me fall after you grab the rope?
You're just gonna have to trust me!
You know, it's a good thing you're not a big, fat guy, or this would be really difficult.
Aah! Aah!
Almost.
Got it!
It's stuck.
Take your time.
No hurry here.
Scorpions!
Aah ha ha!
Kuzco!
Aah!
Oh, no!
Uhh!
Aah!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Huh?
Aah!
Aah!
Whoa!
- Huh?
Look out!
Ohh!
Pacha: Ohh
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Ooh, look at me and my bad self.
I snatched you right out of the air.
"Ooh, I'm a crumbly canyon wall, and I'm taking you with me."
Well, not today, pal.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh
You just saved my life.
Huh?
So?
- I knew it.
- Knew what?
That there is some good in you after all.
Oh, no
- Admit it.
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.
- Nuh-uh.
- I think there is.
- Hey, you could've let me fall.
- Nuh-uh!
Come on, what's the big deal?
Nobody's that heartless.
Don't read too much into it.
It was a one-time thing.
Right. Sure.
Well, we better get going.
With that bridge out, it's a 4-daywalk to the palace.
What?
You mean you're still taking me back?
I shook on it, didn't I?
Well, yeah, but I hope you realize that doesn't change a thing.
I'm still building
Kuzcotopia when I get back.
Well, 4 days is a long time.
Who knows? Maybe you'll change your mind.
Uh-huh.
4 days.
What are the chances of you carrying me?
Not good.
No, no, no!
We've searched every village surrounding the palace and still no sign of Kuzco.
Where is he?
Kronk!
Kronk here.
I'm getting tired.
Pull over.
Sure thing.
Kronk out.
Ooh! Aah!
Aah! Ohh!
Perfect.
These are my best shoes.
I hate this jungle.
Oh, look.
A golden-throated small-winged warbler.
Just one more for exotic bird bingo.
Aah!
I am loving this.
Get away from me!
Uhh
Yeah.
Tell me about it.
No, no, it's not you.
She's not the easiest person to get close to.
There's a wall there.
Trust me.
Are you talking to that squirrel?
I was a junior chipmunk.
I had to be versed in all the woodland creatures.
Please continue.
Aah!
Why me?
Why me?
Hey, it doesn't always have to be about you.
This poor little guy has had it rough.
Seems a talking llama
Kronk: gave him a hard time the other day
Oh, a talking llama?
Ha ha ha ha!
Do tell.
Heh heh heh heh!
Uh, he doesn't really want to talk to you.
Well, then you ask him.
I hate being in the middle.
Squeaky, uh... squeak, squeaker, squeakin'.
Aah!
Jaguars? No kidding?
Brutal.
Uh, could you give us a little room here?
Uh, sorry.
Uh-uh.
A little bit more, please.
How is this?
- Yeah, that's good.
Now ask him which way the talking llama went!
Uh, squeakity-squeak, squeakin'.
Low blood sugar, huh?
Yeah.
It's a curse. Ha.
Well, as soon as we get something to eat, you're walking the rest of the way.
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut, home of the mug...
...of meat.
What'll it be?
Ahem. We'll have
2 specials.
Is that all right, dear?
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.
Hee hee hee. We're on our honeymoon.
Bless you for coming out in public.
So that's 2 specials.
And an onion log.
To split.
Ordering!
I need 2 heartburns and a deep-fried doorstop on table 1 2!
Ok, so I'll admit this was a good idea.
When will you learn that all my ideas are good ones?
That's funny, because I thought you going into the jungle by yourself, being chased by jaguars, lying to me to take you back to the palace were all really bad ideas.
Anything sounds bad when you say it with that attitude.
Hot and crispy pill bug for the happy couple.
Mazeltov
Oh, boy.
Ooh. Ugh. Bluh.
Urp!
Oh, here
Let me get that for you
Bleaggh! Uck!
Where are you going?
I'm just going to slip into the kitchen and have a word with the chef.
You're gonna get us thrown out.
Please.
With this disguise,
I'm invisible.
Heh heh!
We've been walking around in circles for who knows how long.
That is the last time we take directions from a squirrel.
I should have done away with Kuzco myself when I had the chance.
Oh, you really gotta stop beating yourself up about that.
Uh-oh I'll get you another one there, Yzma
You using that fork there, pal?
Hey, don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Wrestled you in high school?
Don't remember that.
Metal shop? I got it!
Miss Narca's interpretive dance--2 semesters.
I was usually in the back because of my weak ankles.
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.
I don't think we've ever met, but I gotta go.
Don't worry.
I'll think of it.
Look, all I know is the food looked iffy.
I'm not the only one that thinks that, I'm sure.
Psst! Hey!
So I'm just checking to make sure you're going to take the main course up a notch.
Is there anything on this menu that is not swimming in gravy?
Hang on.
I'll go ask the chef.
It's a simple question.
Is there or is there not anything edible...
- on this menu?
- Gah!
Hey, I didn't ask him about dessert yet!
Hey, pal, what's your policy on making special orders?
All right, buster, that's it!
You want a special order, then you make it!
I quit!
Yeah, but l--
I try and I try, but there's no respect for anyone with vision.
That's it!
There's just nothing
I can do about it!
Please don't go.
3 pork combos, extra bacon on the side,
2 chili cheese samplers, a basket of liver and onion rings, a catch of the day, and a steak cut in the shape of a trout.
You got all that, honey?
3 oinkers wearing pants, plate of hot air, basket of grandma's breakfast, and change the bull to a gill, got it.
What's going on?
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.
What is he doing in there?
Unh! Come on!
In a minute.
I'm still hungry.
No, Kuzco!
Ok, I'll make it simple for you.
I'll have a spinach omelet with wheat toast.
- You got it?
- Can do.
What's taking so long?
Pickup!
Kronk!
What are you doing?
Kinda busy here.
Why am I not surprised?
Your order's up!
Ohh!
Oh, well, while you're at it, make me the special.
And hold the gravy!
Check. Pickup!
You know what?
On second thought, make my omelet a meat pie.
Meat pie Check
Kronk!
Can I order the potatoes as a side dish?
I'll have to charge you full price.
Ooh!
Hey, how about a side of potatoes, my buddy?
You got it. Want cheese on those potatoes?
Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.
Cheddar spuds coming up.
Spuds yes, cheese no.
Hold the cheese.
No, I want the cheese
Cheese me no like.
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!
Come on, make up your mind!
Ok, ok, on second thought...
Make my potatoes a salad.
Excuse me. You see that woman over there?
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.
Waiters: 1, 2, 3, 4
Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you
We wish it was our birthday
So we could party, too
Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true
Ha ha ha!
It's your birthday?
What are you doing?
Look, there's 2 people in there looking for you.
What?
A big guy and a skinny old woman.
Wait. Was this woman scary beyond all reason?
Oh, yeah.
That's Yzma and Kronk!
I'm saved!
Trust me, they're not here to save you.
They'll take me back to the palace.
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.
I can take it from here.
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.
Kill me? Their whole world revolves around me.
No. I can't let you!
What? Wha--
Oh, I get it!
What?
You don't want to take me back to the palace.
You want to keep me stranded out here forever.
No!
This has all been an act, and I almost fell for it.
Will you just listen to me--
No, no, you listen to me.
All you care about is your stupid hilltop!
What?
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.
- Go!
- But--
Go on! Get outta here!
Fine! Hmph!
Oh, this entire mess is all your fault.
What'd I do?
If you hadn't mixed up those poisons,
Kuzco would be dead now!
There'll be no more diversions until we track that llama down and kill him!
Said I was sorry.
Can't just let it go.
Not even on your birthday.
Kuzco must be eliminated
The empire will finally be rid of that useless slug
You got a point
Nobody really seems to care that he's gone, do they?
Pacha!
Pacha?
So this is where you came in
See, just like I said,
I'm the victim here
I didn't do anything, and they ruined my life and took everything I had
Hey, give it a rest up there, will you?
What? I’m just telling them what happened
Who you kidding, pal?
They saw the whole thing, they know what happened.
Well, yeah, but
Just leave me alone.
The peasant at the diner!
He didn't pay his check.
He's the peasant who I saw leaving the city who disappeared into the crowd with Kuzco on the back of his cart.
He must have taken him back to his village, so if we find the village, we find him, and if we find him, we find Kuzco.
Oh, yeah, it's all comin' together.
Yzma!
What?!
Aah!
This had better be good!
Yeech.
So, there we were standing on the cliff, and the ground started to rumble
And just as it started to go, he grabbed me before I fell
Do you believe that?
You know, call me crazy for following this guy all the way out here, but as much as he tries to deny it,
I know there's some good in him
Besides, I couldn't just leave him out here all alone.
He's a lousy llama.
I mean, a really lousy llama.
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know, what I said to you back at the diner, that--that--
I--I didn't really...
So...you tired of being a llama?
Ye-ee-ee-es!
Ok, we're just gonna stop at the house and get some supplies.
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.
My relatives?
We just sent them up to your house.
What did they look like?
See, there was this big guy and this older woman who was...
How would you describe her?
Scary beyond all reason.
Yeah, that's it.
So, remind me again how you're related to Pacha?
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's wife's step-niece's great-aunt. Heh heh.
Twice removed.
Uh-huh.
Isn't that right, Kronk?
99 monkeys jumpin' on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
You know, I am so sorry that you had to come all this way, but as I said to you before, you may recall,
Pacha is not here.
I'll be sure and tell him you came by.
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.
Oops. Silly me.
No, no. Allow me.
She's hiding something.
When I give the word, we search the house.
Ok, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.
Grr!
So, while we're waiting for Paca--
Pacha.
Oh, yes.
Perhaps we can have a tour of your lovely home.
You know, why don't you just come back when Pacha gets home?
I'm sure he'd love to show you the...
Excuse me, won't you?
I think I left something in the oven.
This is my variation of double-dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.
Kronk, it's time! ok!
Ohh!
So, we have to get back to the palace, find the lab, and change him back.
Hi there!
Aah!
- That was him.
- Whoops.
You know what?
I don't believe you're really my great-aunt.
You're more like my great-great-great...
Go. I'll stall them long enough for you two to get a head start.
Thanks, honey.
You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.
Great-great- great...
Grr! All right!
Are you through?
...great-great-aunt.
So, where were we?
Listen, sister, we're not leaving until--
I show you the house.
Of course.
Was it a good idea to leave your family with those two?
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.
There is no handle in here.
There's not?
Are you sure?
All right, I've had enough of this.
Tell us where the talking llama is and we'll burn your house to the ground.
Uh, don't you mean "or"?
Tell us where the talking llama is or we'll burn your house to the ground.
Well, which is it?
That seems like a pretty crucial conjunction.
That's it!
Kronk, break the door down!
Break it down?
Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.
I don't care, you fool.
Get out of my way.
I'll break it down myself.
A-one
Ok, kids, you know what to do.
Right, Mom!
Aah!
Ok, children, on your mark, get set, go!
Ow! Ow! Stop it, you little brats! Huh?
Ow!
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!
Ha ha ha! Well,
I had a great time.
Let's not wait until the next family reunion to get together.
Kronk!
I, uh, I gotta run.
Ok, why does she even have that lever?
Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times
Aah!
Huh?
What does it look like?
I don't know.
Just keep looking.
Over here!
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...
Oh, my
Looking for this?
No! It can't be!
How did you get back here before us?
Uh...how did we, Kronk?
Well, you got me.
By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.
Oh, well, back to business.
Ok, I admit it.
Maybe I wasn't as nice as I should have been, but, Yzma, do you really want to kill me?
Just think of it as you're being let go, that your life's going in a different direction, that your body's part of a permanent outplacement.
Hey, that's kind of like what he said to you when you got fired.
I know. It's called a cruel irony-- like my dependence on you.
I can't believe this is happening!
Then I bet you weren't expecting this
- No!
- Aah!
Aha!
Oh, ok.
Ha ha!
Finish them off.
Hey, you're not backing down now, are you, big guy?
Uh, where's the other guy?
Yo!
Sorry I'm late.
So, what'd I miss?
Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife and asked me to, you know, take them out.
Then this guy popped up and we waited for you, and quite honestly--
Kronk! Why did I think you could do this?
This one simple thing.
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.
Whoa now.
A really, really big stupid monkey named Kronk!
Ouch.
And do you want to know something else?
I've never liked your spinach puffs.
Never!
That's it.
She's going down.
Now, now, remember, guys.
From above, the wicked shall receive their just reward.
That'll work.
Strange.
That usually works.
And so does this!
Ah. Should have seen that coming.
Whoa!
Aah!
Give me that vial!
Oof!.
Ah! Ha ha!
Aah!
Oops. Clumsy me.
Which one? Which one?
Better hurry
I'm expecting company
Kill them!
They murdered the emperor!
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me--Kuzco!
They're not listening to me!
Just take 'em all!
- Yaah!
- Yaah!
Get them!
Hey, I've been turned into a cow.
Can I go home?
You're excused.
Anyone else?
All: No, we're good.
Get them!
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.
Uh, Pacha?
A little help!
Come on!
Come on!
Aah!
Oh, please be something with wings.
Yeah! We're flyin'!
Uh-oh!
We're not getting anywhere with you picking the vials.
I'm picking the next one!
Fine by me!
Give me that one!
Don't you say a word.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Quick!
Drain the canals!
Pacha: Open up!
Yay! I'm a llama again!
Wait...
- Aah!
- Aah!
There they go!
After them!
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!
Aah!
Grr!
Aah!
Ok, only 2 left. It's gotta be one of these.
No!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Meow.
I'll take that.
This is the one. This'll change you back to a human.
Ow! Hey, get her off!.
Whoa!
Get her off me!
Aah! Ow!
Drink the potion!
Ok, ok! Aah!
Where did it go?
Where is it?
Looking for this?
Is that my voice?
Is that my voice?
Oh, well.
No! Don't drop it!
I'm not going to drop it, you fool!
I'm going to drink it!
And once I turn back into my beautiful self,
I'm going to kill you!
Ha ha ha!
Aah!
Aah! Uh-oh.
Yzma: Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Uhh! Whoa!
Uhh! Oh-oh-oh!
Kuzco!
Be right there!
Give me a minute!
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
Kuzco! Whoa!
Kuzco!
Aah!
Oh.
The vial!
Aah!
For the last time, we did not order a giant trampoline.
You know, pal, you could have told me that before I set it up.
Aah!
Aah! Uhh--
Huh? Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Hoo hoo hee hee ha ha ha--
The vial!
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Ah ha ha ha ha!
I win.
Whoa.
Got it!
What are the odds of that trapdoor leading me out here?
Yeah!
Uhh.
Here, uh, let me get this for you.
Well, see ya on the other side.
Old man: Oh, now, you--you you stop being so hard on yourself.
All is forgiven.
You're sure?
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window, and it won't be the last.
What can I say?
I'm a rebel.
Whoa-ho-ho, tiger.
Oh! Hey, I got to use that arm later.
Ok, buddy, take care.
Ha ha.
Ah, he's a sweet guy.
So, you lied to me
I did?
Yeah. You said when the sun hits this ridge just right, these hills sing.
Well, pal, I was dragged all over those hills, and I did not hear any singing.
So
I'll be building my summer home on a more magical hill.
Thank you.
Hmm. Couldn't pull the wool over your eyes, huh?
No, no, I'm sharp,
I'm on it.
Looks like you and your family are stuck on that tuneless hill top forever, pal.
You know, I'm pretty sure
I heard some singing on the hill next to us.
In case you're interested.
Ha! Boom, baby!
Ha! Boom, baby!
You'd be the coolest dude
In the nation
Or the hippest cat in creation
But if you ain't got friends, then nothing's worth the fuss
A perfect world will come to be
When everybody here can see
That a perfect world begins and ends
A perfect world begins and ends
A perfect world begins and ends with us
" My acorn is missing."
Squeak squeakin' squeak squeakity.
" Did you eat the acorn?"
Squeaker squeak squeak squeakin'?
"You owe me a new acorn."
Squeak squeak squeak squeak squeaker--
Squeakin'.
I'm so proud of you guys.
Edited by:  Mr Najsman
On "The vampire diaries"...
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
- The Sun and the Moon curse?
- Klaus is the real deal.
From the first generation of vampires.
The oldest vampire in the history of time
- is coming after me?
- Elijah.
- He´s one of the Originals...
- a legend.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
You and I shall draw
Klaus out together and I shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed.
- And then what?
- Then I kill him.
I come bearing gifts... this is how you kill an Original.
Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
You can't do it.
Even with the dagger and a little white out cash?
If you kill Elijah, then
I'm stuck in here forever.
As long as we keep the dagger in there,
- then he stays dead.
- Pretty much.
How did you get out?
I knew that I had begged you
not to kill Elijah, that's exactly what you'd do.
As soon as Originals die, compulsion wears off.
What did Luka tell you?
About your daughter...
You know where Klaus has her.
I want to help you get her back.
No!
He took my powers.
Stefan, we're late for school.
- Let's be later.
- Stefan, it's school.
Remember, that thing that we keep forgetting about?
- Hey!
- School?
Doesn't ring a bell.
- Stefan! Ok, 5 minutes.
- Only for 5 minutes.
Good morning, Damon.
What are you doing here?
I told you to leave.
What is your problem?
You're wearing her clothes?
Like that's going to work.
You think I'm Katherine?
Why would you think that?
Katherine's in a tomb!
Isn't she?
What the hell's going on here?
I don't know, you tell me.
Is Katherine in the tomb or not?
What are you doing?!
How could you do this?!
Stefan, you're hurting me!
Stop it, Katherine!
Stop what?
It's getting really easy being you.
- What is she doing here?
- When we killed Elijah, it broke the compulsion and freed the bitch from the tomb.
- How's that possible?
- He's an Original.
They have all sorts of special skills.
I don't want you here.
Get her out of here.
You need me, Elena.
- You all do.
- Like hell.
We all want the same thing... Klaus dead.
Yet here you all are, running around like chickens
- with their heads cut off.
- I don't need your help and I don't want it.
And that's incredibly stupid of you.
You know where Klaus is?
When he's coming, what he looks like?
If you know something, say it or get out.
Fine. Then I'll just go to the grill and have some lunch... maybe
Aunt Jenna's free for a bite.
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.
Live band?
Yeah, business has been a little slow.
The grill's trying to stay afloat.
Aren't we all?
Have you heard from Tyler?
Not a peep. You?
No, not since he stopped by the grill to talk, and I've left messages on his cell phone.
He stopped by to see you?
- What did he say?
- Not much, really.
I mean... I think to say good-bye without really saying good-bye. I just didn't know.
And that's all he said?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline.
Why? I mean, is there something you want to tell me?
Yeah! I...
I mean, no, I... it's just not that easy.
I don't get it!
Since when have I been the one that can express himself and you're one with a loss for words?
No, you're right, and I'm sorry.
You know how I feel.
So it's your move.
Just make a decision or leave me alone.
Why is she still here?
She was free.
She wants what we want...
Klaus's death.
Maybe she sees us as her only chance.
Or maybe she's trying to lure you and Damon back into her web.
- I want her gone.
- So do I.
But you're right, she's staying.
Shouldn't we at least try to figure out why?
How? All she does is lie.
Look, I hate it as much as you do, but she does make a point.
We don't know anything about Klaus. She does.
Right, but that doesn't mean
I want her shacking up with you.
Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.
Hmm, I can't.
I told Bonnie and Caroline that they could come over.
Bonnie's freaked because she lost her powers and
Caroline's having Matt drama again.
It's kind of a girls' night.
Maybe Katherine can join us.
Come on.
Mmm, burning flesh.
If you're trying to get the dagger back, you're wasting your time.
He's indestructible.
No kidding.
How do you know so much about Original vampires?
Spend 500 years running from one.
So when I told you my plan to kill Elijah, why didn't you warn me that I'd die if I used a dagger on him?
Oh, there's so many rules.
It's all very confusing.
Did you know I would die?
Did Elijah tell you his plan?
Did he have a dagger to kill Klaus with?
Why are you still here?
Because you haven't forcibly removed me.
You wouldn't.
Oh, I would.
Damon, be smart.
I want Klaus dead just as much as you do.
More.
If I wasn't be honest about helping,
I'd be long gone by now, ok?
You can hate me.
But we want the same thing.
And you know...
I always get what I want.
I wanted out of the tomb.
Didn't matter who paid the price.
Of course I knew that you'd die.
She's out of the tomb?
Yeah. We're dealing with it, all right?
Just be extra careful.
She's getting a little too good at impersonating Elena.
With Katherine still around, we gotta find a way to get your powers back.
Listen, I want to get the Martins on our side.
I want to figure out a way for us all to work together now that Elijah's out of the picture.
It's impossible.
They hate us.
It's either win them over or somebody's going to end up dead.
You think you can at least convince them to have a civil conversation?
I'll try.
Thanks. Keep me posted.
Ok. I gotta get to class.
All right, I'll see ya.
Come on.
Elena's nowhere in sight.
I'll tell her soon.
I promise.
All right.
It was bad. You know, John planted all these seeds about Isobel and now Jenna knows
I'm lying about something.
John's going to end up dead on the kitchen floor if he's not careful.
Yeah, well, easier said than done.
I gave him back his ring.
So.
Look, Jenna keeps asking about Isobel.
You know, was she murdered?
Why haven't they found the body?
I mean, how much longer can she stay in the dark?
You think we should tell her the truth?
I'm saying I can't be with her and not tell her.
It's not fair to her, and it's not the kind of relationship I want.
Not to mention it's becoming more dangerous for her not to know.
I just thought that we'd at least hold off until after we've dealt with Klaus.
You know, and even then, how do we tell someone what we know?
How does someone hear that?
Look, I'm sorry to put this on you.
But I feel it's your decision to make.
And whatever you decide to do, I'll respect it.
I want to be honest with her.
But until then,
Jenna and I are done.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't want to.
But my son made a case to hear you out.
Bonnie said that you have information about Elijah.
Elijah's dead.
I'm sorry.
Hear me out.
We can help you.
We know that Klaus has your daughter.
I'm sorry about the way
I had to get that information, but it's good that we know.
We can all work together to get her back.
How?
I suspect that you and Elijah had a plan to kill Klaus.
I'll just help you carry it out.
You can trust us. I give you my word. We all do.
- What you up to?
- None of your business.
We're pouting now?
Are those the Gilbert journals?
How am I supposed to help you if you won't tell me what you're up to?
Can you tell me where a bunch of witches were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago?
No.
- Then you can't help.
- Ugh.
If it's any consolation,
I'm glad that you're not dead.
Emily Bennett told me about the massacre.
It was a big deal in witch folklore.
When a witch dies violently, they release a mystical energy making the place of their death with power.
I think Elijah wanted to know the site of the massacre.
What was he going to do when he found it?
I don't know.
What did papa witch and baby witch have to say?
Wasn't she gone or dead? Yeah?
For the last time, I'm here to help.
Can we skip the secrets, hmm?
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
But he believed that if a witch could channel enough power...
They wouldn't need one.
Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?
We just need to find it.
But what if they can find the burial ground?
They won't. We tried,
Luka, for weeks.
We don't have a back-up plan, though, dad, and we need to be doing everything we can to save Greta.
We will save her.
But Elijah is the answer, not Stefan and his brother.
Those people, they're our enemies.
They need to be dealt with.
- You're going to kill them?
- No.
I'm going to let Elijah do it.
Chinese food or pizza?
Like you have to ask.
I will get it.
I'll do it.
Do you believe that Jonas is being sincere?
I don't know what to believe.
I think he's at a loss.
He's not sure who to trust.
Join the club.
Well, what are we going to do about this movie situation?
What about "The Notebook"?
Caroline, how many times have you seen that movie?
That is so not the point.
Well, yeah, I mean...
Hey.
What's going on?
Girls' night.
Oh.
How are you doing?
You heard about my fight with Ric.
He feels terrible.
Is this some kind of disguised attempt to cheer me up?
No. No, this is about us girls hanging out.
And, you know, we'll be here if you happen to want to talk, or...
Because I am a winner when it comes to successful relationships.
You, too?
You have no idea.
Ok, then.
It's this whole Isobel thing.
He's hiding something from me.
To play devil's advocate, maybe there is a great reason why he's not telling you.
Maybe he is just trying to protect you.
Well, that's not his call to make.
I mean, I deserve the truth. Everybody does.
Sometimes it's harder than that.
Not if it's somebody you care about, it isn't.
You know what we need?
Dancing. There is a band at the grill.
- I'm in.
- In.
In.
Are you sure about this?
I mean, I would go if I could.
No. I'm not strong enough to send you.
I can do this.
I'll stay anchored.
Use all my energy.
- If you feel weak...
- Dad.
I want this just as much as you.
Concentrate on Elijah.
Picture him in your mind.
I got it.
I'm in the Salvatore house.
Elijah's body must be there.
What do you see?
Elena and Damon.
They're reading.
Good.
If Elijah's there, you'll sense him.
Stay focused.
Can I help you?
I'm bored.
"Emily Bennett was taken by the Council today.
"They kidnapped her from her home
"and took her to the same location
"her ancestors were burned a hundred years ago."
So Emily died on the site of the massacre, too.
Does it say where?
Nope.
You know this whole friendly, cooperative thing?
Mm-hmm.
I don't buy it.
I have no reason to lie to you, Damon.
Lie.
I'm hungry.
You're the unwanted houseguest.
Go feed yourself.
Well, nothing in any of those.
Find anything?
Nope.
That's too bad.
Yeah, bummer.
Elena's fighting me.
What's wrong?
She's stronger than me.
That's because it's not Elena.
It's Katherine Pierce.
Luka... kill her.
- What?
- She's a vampire.
Find a stake and drive it through her heart.
Damon!
Katherine!
What happened?
Damon...
Luka, what's going on?
Luka! Luka!
What are you doing?!
Shutting down a crazy ass psychic witch attack!
Get over there and do something about it.
Now!
No!
Oh, my God! Luka!
Luka! I'm sorry.
Please.
Just wake up, son.
Open your eyes.
Luka!
I love my boy!
I need a drink.
Hey, Matt.
Things just got real awkward.
- Jenna.
- Not tonight, Ric.
Tonight I have traded you for señor tequila.
Yeah.
Well, señor tequila's not going to be treating you very well.
Well, the two of you have a lot in common.
Look, Jenna, I hate that you're this upset with me.
Yeah, well, it's your fault.
Because whatever it is you're keeping from me;
Whatever you think I can't handle...
You're wrong.
'Cause last year I was a grad student who smoked a lot of pot and couldn't keep a goldfish alive.
And now I'm a parent, so I think
I can handle anything, Ric.
Jenna...
He said the ball's in your court.
Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.
Why not? All you do is talk about how much you care about him.
Yeah, but I am still keeping so many secrets.
Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna.
And maybe that's our mistake.
We're trying to protect the people that we love by keeping them out of it, but in the end, we're hurting them anyway.
What are you doing?
What is she doing?
Hey, everybody.
Let's hear it for the band!
Weren't they awesome?
This isn't going to end well.
So there's this guy.
And, uh, he told me to tell him how I feel about him.
Like it's so easy.
Um, you know, just 'cause I talk a lot doesn't mean I always know what I'm actually talking about.
Ah, like now, I'm feeling loopy and I don't really know how to express myself.
I can sing.
Yeah! Yeah.
You know what, I'm going to sing.
Come on, off the stage.
You are going to let me live out my rock star fantasies, and you are going to be my back-up.
What will it be?
♪ Close your eyes, give me your hand ♪
♪ darlin' ♪
♪ do you feel my heart beating? ♪
She's good.
♪ Do you understand? ♪
♪ do you feel the same? ♪
♪ am I only dreaming? ♪

♪ I believe ♪

Matt, I...
- You killed him!
- Aah!
He's dead and I have no one.
And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like.
There you go.
What the hell?!
That's for not telling me the dagger would kill me.
Next time...
It goes in your heart.
Is that how you treat someone who... ahh...
- is trying to help you?
- You wanna help?
Start talking.
I'd love to, but you're not going to like it.
Try me.
Fine. John Gilbert and
Isobel want you and Stefan out of Elena's life.
That's old news.
Not the part where he offered me a deal.
He knew that killing Elijah would get me out of the tomb, so he gave me a choice.
Either I stay and help with Klaus, or he kills Stefan.
But he still tried to have me killed.
Right.
That was part of the deal.
I could only save one of you.
So you chose Stefan.
Of course you did.
You wanted the truth, Damon.
Would you rather I lie?
Ahh! Oh, sorry.
Sorry, Elena.
You know, I really have to get back to work.
Definitely.
I... I wouldn't.
Caroline and Matt are...
In the bathroom?!
If they're happy,
- I'm happy.
- Um, hey, speaking of happy, would it freak you out if I started dating your brother?
You're into my brother?
I know it's weird, um, but he's been so good and strong. It makes me happy.
And I really can't tell what you're thinking...
Right now.
I'm thinking that...
My brother has had more pain in his life than a hundred people's worth of pain, and...
He deserves to be with someone as amazing as you.
Really?
Really.
Oh.
Hey, Stefan, I'm at the grill.
I can't hear you.
Hold... yeah.
Where are you going?
Luka Martin's dead.
His father's going after Elena.
I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
- Wait.
I don't need your help.
I don't want it.
I know what we can do, Damon.
You have to let me do it.
Dr. Martin. You ok?
Where is she?
I don't understand.
My son is dead.
Whatever it is you think you need to do, there's a better way.
They killed Elijah and they killed Luka.
And my only shot at getting my daughter back is if I have Elena.
No. No, Dr. Martin.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I haven't seen her.
What the hell?
Mmm!
- The power's out.
- Even better.
I wish, but I should probably... whoa.
Hey!
- We have a problem.
- What's going on?
Jonas is here and he's after Elena.
Oh, my God!
We have a plan, but I need to get Elena out of here.
Well, what can I do?
- It's time to get out of here.
- I have to find Elena.
She's with Stefan, she's ok.
No one's getting out of here until I have her.
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie.
Come on. Come on.
Dr. Martin!
I'm so sorry about Luka.
I never wanted that to happen, but... at least let us help you get your daughter back.
Only Elijah can do that.
You don't need Elijah.
Caroline!
Get away from her!
Matt, no!
Matt!
Matt! No!
Matt! Matt!
Oh! Oh, my God!
Ok. Uh...
Just breath Caroline... just breath.
You have to drink.
Please, please.
Luka...
I can't believe he's dead.
After what we did to him.
No, after what he did to you.
Look, I'm sorry, I know you feel bad about all of this, but I don't.
I couldn't do anything to help.
I was useless.
I hated it.
- Thank God.
- It's not over yet.
- What's going on?
- He'll explain.
When did you guys get home?
- A few minutes ago.
- Did you check the house?
And why would we check the house?
You're welcome.
You didn't have to kill him!
Yes, we did.
Get off!
How did you guys convince her to do this?
We didn't.
It was actually her idea.
Wow. That's...
Not good.
No. No, that's not good at all.
Everything's taken care of.
I'm guessing you're going to want this back.
But your pretty little outfit is going to need a good dry clean.
You're going to have to get her out of here before Jenna gets home.
Is that all you have to say to me?
This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
I don't much like you, either, if we're going to be open.
And frankly, I'd be happy to see you dead, but if we're going to try to take on Klaus, we kinda need you to be alive.
So I'm not a threat to you, Elena.
If any of you are going to believe anything, believe that.
Thanks for getting me home.
That was kind of crazy.
Jenna, are you going to be ok?
Look,
Isobel is dead.
And there things about her death that I can't tell you;
That aren't for me to tell.
You can be upset and hate me.
I get it.
But just know that I love you.
At least I can tell you that much.
Good night, Ric.
Good night.
Hey.
You made it home.
Tonight was very weird.
Tell me about it.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be.
No, I'm serious, Bonnie.
The only witch that could given you your powers back is dead, and...I think you have a serious case of denial going, and I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what, and...
Not that denial's the worst thing.
Did you...
When he grabbed me...
He gave me my powers back.
And something else.
Jonas wants me to kill Klaus.
And did he include a how?
Yeah.
He did.
You know what I can't figure out?
What's that?
How the town knew
Emily Bennett was a witch.
I mean, because according to Johnathan Gilbert, he was the only one who knew.
I know he didn't turn her in.
Mmm, I should have figured as much.
Oh, she was a loose end.
I like mine tied up.
You know what I can't figure out?
Do I care?
Why you won't tell me where to find the site of the witch massacre.
Because I have no clue.
You knew that Emily Bennett was the key to getting me out of that tomb.
And something tells me that you did everything in your power to make sure that she was safe, yet you have no idea where she was killed.
Who's the liar now?
- You hurt me today.
- Tit for tat.
You were mean.
And very rough.
And monstrous.
You deserved it.
I like this Damon.
Katherine.
Katherine, there are six other bedrooms in this house.
Go find one.
Hi.
What the hell?
I had your face...
And all the blood.
I... I drank your blood.
You were dying.
My blood healed you.
What do you mean, it healed me?
How can your blood heal me?
Because that's what vampire blood does for humans, and that's what I am.
I'm a vampire, Matt.
No.
But it's all going to be ok, because I am going to tell you everything, and you're going to understand why I had to keep it from you, and we're going to be fine.
We'll be fine?!
Yes, because we're together and we love each other.
Vampires.
Oh, my God.
Vickie, oh, my God, at the hospital,
I thought that she was tripping out.
What?
Vickie, she knew about the vampires, and I...
What... what did you do?
Nothing. Nothing! Matt!
I need to get out of here.
No, no, no! I can't let you leave. I cannot let you leave.
What did you do to my sister?
Nothing! Nothing! I swear,
I swear, nothing, nothing!
- What did you do?!
- Nothing, Matt!!
You have to calm down! Matt!
Are John and Jeremy asleep?
I think so.
If I go to bed right now, there's a chance I'll wake up hangover-free.
Who's that?
Hi. You must be Jenna.
I'm...
Elena's mother.
Isobel.
Sync by jeska | Corrections by Alice http://www.addic7ed.com/
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
First off, I'd like to thank this board for taking the time to hear my proposal.
Now, we've all heard of the legend of Atlantis, a continent somewhere in the mid-Atlantic that was home to an advanced civilization, possessing technology far beyond our own, that, according to our friend Plato here, was suddenly struck by some cataclysmic event that sank it beneath the sea.
Now, some of you may ask, why Atlantis?
It's just a myth, isn't it?
Pure fantasy.
Well, that is where you'd be wrong.
10,000 years before the Egyptians built the pyramids,
Atlantis had electricity, advanced medicine, even the power of flight.
Impossible, you say?
Well, no. No, not for them.
Numerous ancient cultures all over the globe agree that Atlantis possessed a power source of some kind more powerful than steam, than coal.
More powerful than our modern internal combustion engines.
Gentlemen, I propose that we find Atlantis, find that power source, and bring it back to the surface.
Now, this is a page from an illuminated text that describes a book called
The Shepherd's Journal, said to have been a firsthand account of Atlantis and its exact whereabouts.
Now, based on a centuries-old translation of a Norse text, historians have believed the Journal resides in Ireland.
But after comparing the text to the runes on this Viking shield,
I found that one of the letters had been mistranslated.
So, by changing this letter and inserting the correct one, we find that The Shepherd's Journal, the key to Atlantis, lies not in Ireland, gentlemen, but in Iceland.
Pause for effect.
Gentlemen, I'll take your questions now.
Would you gentlemen please excuse me for a moment?
Cartography and Linguistics,
Milo Thatch speaking.
Yeah. Just a second.
Pardon me, Mr. Hickenbottom.
How's that? Is that better?
Yeah. You're welcome.
- And don't let it happen again.
- All right, bye.
Now, as you can see by the...
By this map...
Map that...
That I've drawn, I plotted the route that will take myself and a crew to the southern coast of Iceland to retrieve the Journal.
Showtime.
Well, this is it.
I am finally getting out of the dungeon.
"Dear Mr. Thatch, this is to inform you"
"that your meeting today has been moved up from 4:30 p.m. To 3:30 p.m."
What?
"Dear Mr. Thatch, due to your absence,"
"the board has voted to reject your proposal."
"Have a nice weekend.
Mr. Harcourt's office."
They can't do this to me!
I swear, that young Thatch gets crazier every year.
If I ever hear the word "Atlantis" again,
I'll step in front of a bus.
I'll push you.
- Mr. Harcourt!
- Good Lord!
- There he is!
- Members of the board... Wait.
- How did you find us?
- Mr. Harcourt, wait!
Head for the hills!
Where is a guard when you need him?
Mr. Harcourt, you gotta listen to me, sir!
Sir?
Wait! Mr. Harcourt!
Sir, I have new evidence that...
Please, Mr. Harcourt!
Stop! Sir, if you... Could you hold...
Thank you very much. Look at...
This museum funds scientific expeditions based on facts, not legends and folklore.
Besides, we need you here.
- We depend on you.
- You do?
Yes. What with winter coming, that boiler's going to need a lot of attention.
- Boiler?
- Onward, Heinz!
But there... There's a journal!
It's in Iceland! I'm sure of it this time!
Sir, I really hoped it wouldn't come to this, but this is a letter of resignation.
If you reject my proposal, I'll...
I'll quit!
I mean it, sir.
If you refuse to fund my proposal...
You'll what?
Flush your career down the toilet, just like your grandfather?
You have a lot of potential, Milo.
Don't throw it all away chasing fairy tales.
But I can prove Atlantis exists!
You want to go on an expedition?
Here. Take a trolley to the Potomac and jump in!
Maybe the cold water will clear your head. Heinz!
I'm home.
Fluffy? Here, kitty.
Milo James Thatch?
Who... Who are you?
How did you get in here?
I came down the chimney.
My name is Helga Sinclair.
I'm acting on behalf of my employer, who has a most intriguing proposition for you.
Are you interested?
Your employer?
Who is your employer?
This way, please.
And don't drip on the Caravaggio.
Step lively.
Mr. Whitmore does not like to be kept waiting.
You will address him as "Mr. Whitmore" or "sir."
You will stand unless asked to be seated.
Keep your sentences short and to the point.
Are we clear?
And relax.
He doesn't bite... often.
Grandpa?
Finest explorer I ever met.
Preston Whitmore.
Pleasure to meet you, Milo.
Join me in a little yoga?
No, no. Thank you.
Did you really know my grandfather?
Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus back in Georgetown.
Class of '66. We stayed close friends till the end of his days.
Even dragged me along on some of his danged fool expeditions.
Thatch was crazy as a fruit bat, he was.
He spoke of you often.
Funny. He never mentioned you.
He wouldn't.
He knew how much I like my privacy.
I keep a low profile.
Mr. Whitmore, should I be wondering why I'm here?
Look on that table.
It's for you.
It's from my grandfather.
He brought that package to me years ago.
He said if anything were to happen to him,
I should give it to you when you were ready.
Whatever that means.
It...
It can't be.
It's The Shepherd's Journal.
Mr. Whitmore, this journal is the key to finding the lost continent of Atlantis!
Atlantis.
I wasn't born yesterday, son.
No, no, no. Look. Look at this.
Coordinates. Clues. It's all right here.
Yeah, looks like gibberish to me.
That's because it's been written in a dialect that no longer exists.
- So it's useless.
- No, no, just difficult.
I've spent my whole life studying dead languages.
It's not gibberish to me.
It's probably a fake.
Mr. Whitmore, my grandfather would have known if this were a fake. I would know.
I will stake everything I own, everything that I believe in, that this is the genuine Shepherd's Journal.
All right, all right.
So, what do you want to do with it?
Well, I'll get funding.
- I mean, I'll... The museum...
- They'll never believe you.
I'll show them! I will make them believe.
Like you did today?
Yes! Well, no. How did you...
Forget about them, okay? Never mind!
I will find Atlantis on my own.
I mean, if I have to rent a rowboat!
Congratulations, Milo.
This is exactly what I wanted to hear.
But forget the rowboat, son.
We'll travel in style.
It's all been arranged, the whole ball of wax.
Why?
For years, your granddad bent my ear with stories about that old book.
I didn't buy it for a minute.
So, finally, I got fed up and I made a bet with the old coot.
I said, "Thatch, if you ever actually find that so-called journal",
"not only will I finance the expedition,"
"but I'll kiss you full on the mouth."
Imagine my embarrassment when he found the darn thing.
Now, I know your grandfather's gone, Milo,
God rest his soul, but Preston Whitmore is a man who keeps his word.
You hear that, Thatch?
I'm going to the afterlife with a clear conscience, by thunder!
Your grandpa was a great man.
You probably don't realize how great.
Those buffoons at the museum dragged him down, made a laughing stock of him.
He died a broken man.
If I could bring back just one shred of proof, that'd be enough for me.
Thatch.
What are we standing around for?
We got work to do.
But, Mr. Whitmore, you know, in order to do what you're proposing, you're gonna need a crew.
Taken care of.
You'll need engineers and geologists.
Got 'em all. The best of the best.
Gaetan Moliere, geology and excavation.
The man has a nose for dirt.
Vincenzo Santorini, demolitions.
Busted him out of a Turkish prison.
Audrey Ramirez.
Don't let her age fool you.
She's forgotten more about engines than you and I will ever know.
They're the same crew that brought the Journal back.
- Where was it?
- Iceland.
I knew it! I knew it!
All we need now is an expert in gibberish.
So, it's decision time.
You can build on the foundation your grandfather left you or you can go back to your boiler room.
- This is for real.
- Now you're catching on.
All right. Okay. I'll have to quit my job.
It's done. You resigned this afternoon.
- I did?
- Yep. Don't like to leave loose ends.
My apartment.
I'm gonna have to give notice.
- Taken care of.
- My clothes?
- Packed.
- My books?
- In storage.
- My cat?
My gosh.
Your granddad had a saying.
"Our lives are remembered, by the gifts we leave our children."
This journal is his gift to you, Milo.
Atlantis is waiting.
What do you say?
I'm your man, Mr. Whitmore.
You will not regret this.
Boy, I am so excited,
I can't even hold it in.
Carrots. Why is there always carrots?
I didn't even eat carrots.
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.
To whoever took the "L" from the Motor Pool sign, we are all very amused.
Excuse me? I need to report in?
Yes, Mr. Thatch?
It's you!
Blondie, I got a bone to pick with you.
Hold that thought.
What is it this time, Cookie?
You done stuffed my wagon full to busting with non-essentials.
Look at all this.
Cinnamon, oregano, cilantro.
What in the cockadoodle is cilantro?
And what is this?
That would be lettuce.
Lettuce? Lettuce?
It's a vegetable, Cookie.
The men need the four basic food groups.
I got your four basic food groups!
Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard!
All right, cowboy.
Pack it up and move it out.
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.
Final loading in progress.
Hey, Junior.
If you're looking for the pony rides, they're back there.
Excuse me. Excuse me?
You dropped your dynamite.
What else have you got in there?
Gunpowder, nitroglycerin, notepads, fuses, wicks, glue, and...
Paper clips. Big ones.
You know, just office supplies.
Milo! Where you been?
I want you to meet Commander Rourke.
He led the Iceland team that brought the Journal back.
Milo Thatch.
Pleasure to meet the grandson of old Thaddeus.
I see you got that journal. Nice pictures, but I prefer a good western myself.
Pretty impressive?
Boy, when you settle a bet, you settle a bet.
Well, your granddad always believed you couldn't put a price on the pursuit of knowledge.
Well, believe me, this'll be small change compared to the value of what we're gonna learn on this trip.
Yes, this should be enriching for all of us.
Attention, all personnel.
Launch will commence in 15 minutes.
- Mr. Whitmore.
- Rourke.
It's time.
- Bye, Mr. Whitmore!
- Make us proud, boy!
Rig ship for dive!
Aye, sir! Rig ship for dive.
Lieutenant, take her down.
Diving officer, submerge the ship.
- Aye!
- Make the depth one-five-zero feet.
Make the depth one-five-zero feet.
Dive, dive! Five degrees down bubble.
- Take us down.
- Take us down!
Attention.
Tonight's supper will be baked beans.
Musical program to follow.
Who wrote this?
You have disturbed the dirt.
- Pardon me?
- You have disturbed the dirt!
Dirt from around the globe, spanning the centuries!
What have you done?
England must never merge with France!
- What's it doing in my bed?
- You ask too many questions.
Who are you? Who sent you?
Speak up!
- Me? I'm...
- I will know soon enough.
Hey, hey, hey! Let go!
Do not be such a crybaby. Hold still.
There you are.
Now, tell me your story, my little friend.
Parchment fiber from the Nile delta circa 500 B.C.
Lead pencil, number 2.
Paint flecks of a type used in government buildings.
You have a cat, shorthaired Persian, two years old, third in a litter of seven.
There are all the microscopic fingerprints of the mapmaker.
And linguist.
- Hey, how did you...
- This is an outrage!
You must leave at once!
Out, out, out, out, out!
Sat in the dirt, didn't you?
Moliere, now what have I told you about playing nice with the other kids?
Get back. I've got soap, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Back, foul creature!
Back to the pit from which you came!
The name's Sweet.
Joshua Sweet. Medical officer.
Yeah, Milo Thatch.
Milo Thatch. You're my 3:00.
Well, no time like the present.
- Oh, boy.
- Nice, isn't it?
The catalog says that this little beauty can saw through a femur in 28 seconds.
I'm betting I can cut that time in half.
Now, stick out your tongue and say, "Ah."
Oh, no, really. I have a...
So, where you from?
Really? I have family up that way.
Beautiful country up there.
Do you do any fishing?
Me? I hate fishing. I hate fish.
Hate the taste, hate the smell, and hate all them little bones.
Here, I'm gonna need you to fill these up.
With what?
Will Milo Thatch please report to the bridge?
Thank you.
I mean, nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you, too.
So I says to him,
"What's wrong with my meatloaf?"
And he says to me...
Hold on a second, Margie,
I got another call.
Sir, we're approaching coordinates.
Hello, Margie?
Yeah, so anyways, he says...
All right, let's have a look around.
Aye, sir. Set course to two-four-zero.
Aye, aye, sir.
15 degrees down angle on the bow planes.
Come right two-four-zero.
Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Thatch.
Okay, everybody,
I want you to give Mr. Thatch your undivided attention.
Good afternoon.
Can everyone hear me okay?
Okay, how about some slides?
The first slide is a depiction of a creature.
A creature so frightening that sailors were said to be driven mad by the mere sight of it.
I'm sorry. That's wrong.
Geez, I used to take lunch money from guys like this.
Anyway, this... Okay.
This is an illustration of the Leviathan, the creature guarding the entrance to Atlantis.
With something like that,
I would have white wine, I think.
It's a mythical sea serpent.
He's described in The Book of Job.
The Bible says,
"Out of his mouth go burning lights,"
"sparks of fire shoot out."
But more likely, it's a carving or a sculpture to frighten the superstitious.
So we find this masterpiece.
Then what?
When do we dig?
Actually, we don't have to dig.
You see, according to the Journal, the path to Atlantis will take us down a tunnel at the bottom of the ocean, and we'll come up a curve into an air pocket right here, where we'll find the remnants of an ancient highway that will lead us to Atlantis.
Kind of like the grease trap in your sink.
Cartographer, linguist, plumber.
Hard to believe he's still single.
- You said there'd be digging.
- Go away, Mole.
Captain, you'd better come look at this, sir.
Okay, class dismissed.
Give me exterior lights.
Look at that.
There are ships here from every era.
Commander, I think you should hear this.
Commander? Commander?
"Enter the lair of the Leviathan."
Commander?
"There you will find the path to the gateway."
- Commander?
- Yes, Mrs. Packard. What is it?
I'm picking up something on the hydrophone.
- I think you should hear.
- Put it on speakers.
What is it? A pod of whales?
Bigger.
It sounds metallic.
Could be an echo off one of the rocks.
Do you want to do my job? Be my guest.
Is it just me, or is that getting louder?
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.
Helmsman! Bring us about.
Tighten our search pattern and slow us to...
Out of the way!
Tell Cookie to melt the butter and break out the bibs.
I want this lobster served up on a silver platter.
Load the torpedo bays!
Sub pod crews, battle stations!
Battle stations!
Steady, boys. Don't panic.
Jiminy Christmas! It's a machine!
Wait, wait!
Launch subpods!
Subpods away!
Fire!
We're free. All ahead full.
Fire torpedoes!
Get me the bridge!
Sir, it's Engineering on four.
Rourke! We took a big hit down here, and we're taking on water fast.
I don't want to be around when it hits the boilers.
How much time do we have?
Twenty minutes, if the bulkhead holds.
You better make that five.
You heard the lady. Let's move!
Move! Where? Move where?
Packard, sound the alarm!
He took his suitcase?
Marge, honey,
I don't think he's coming back.
- Packard!
- I have to call you back.
No, no, I'll call you.
All hands, abandon ship.
Move it, people!
Sometime today would be nice!
Come on! Everybody grab a seat and buckle in.
Lieutenant, get us out of here!
- Lieutenant!
- I'm working on it!
Hang on.
Where to, Mr. Thatch?
We're looking for a big crevice of some kind.
There! Up ahead.
All craft, make your mark
20 degrees down angle.
Roger! 20 degrees down angle.
Right behind you!
- Sacré bleu!
- We're getting killed out here!
Look out!
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink.
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink!
Seven hours ago, we started this expedition with 200 of the finest men and women
I've ever known.
We're all that's left.
I won't sugarcoat it, gentlemen.
We have a crisis on our hands.
But we've been up this particular creek before, and we've always come through, paddle or no paddle.
I see no reason to change that policy now.
From here on in, everyone pulls double duty.
Everyone drives, everyone works.
Looks like all our chances for survival rest with you, Mr. Thatch.
You and that little book.
We're all gonna die.
Okay, people. Saddle up.
Lieutenant, I want this convoy moving five minutes ago.
Moliere, you're on point.
No, Vinny, Audrey's taking the oiler.
You know the rules. I want you 50 yards behind that truck at all times.
And, Packard, put out that cigarette.
Are you sure you're checked out on this class of vehicle?
Can you drive a truck?
Of course I can drive a truck.
I mean, sure, you got your steering, and your gas, and your brake, and of course, this metal-looking thing.
Okay, so it was a bumper car at Coney Island, but it's the same basic principle!
Come on! Move it!
Sorry about... Sorry about that.
Come on, civilian!
You didn't just drink that, did you?
That's not good.
That's nitroglycerin.
Don't move.
Don't breathe.
Don't do anything, except pray, maybe.
Boom!
Yeah.
Good night!
Will you look at the size of this?
It's gotta be half a mile high, at least.
It must have taken hundred...
No, thousands of years to carve this thing.
Hey, look, I made a bridge.
It only took me, like, what?
10 seconds, 11, tops.
Looks like we have a little roadblock.
Vinny, what do you think?
I could un-roadblock that if I had about 200 of these.
Problem is, I only got about 10.
Plus, you know, five of my own, and a couple of cherry bombs, a road flare.
Hey, too bad we don't have some nitroglycerin, Milo?
Looks like we're gonna have to dig.
It will be my pleasure.
Stupid...
Stupid!
I don't understand it.
I just tuned this thing up this morning.
It looks like the rotor's shot!
I'm gonna have to pull a spare from one of the trucks.
- Can I...
- No toques nada!
I'll be right back.
She lives!
Hey, what'd you do?
Well, you know, the boiler in this baby is a Humac model P-54 stroke 813.
Now, we got the 814 back at the museum.
The heating cores on the whole Humac line have always been a little, you know, temperamental, so sometimes you gotta... Boom!
Persuade 'em a little.
Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much.
Shut up.
Two for flinching.
This is it. It's gotta be.
All right, we'll make camp here.
Why is it glowing?
It is a natural phosphorescence.
That thing is going to keep me up all night, I know it.
Come and get it!
For the appetizer, Caesar salad, escargot, and your oriental spring rolls.
- Yuck.
- I wanted the escargot.
Knock yourself out.
There you go, Milo.
Put some meat on them bones.
Thanks, Cookie.
That looks greasier than usual.
You like it? Well, have some more.
You're so skinny, if you turned sideways and stuck out your tongue, you'd look like a zipper.
You know, we've been pretty tough on the kid.
What do you say we cut him some slack?
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, Milo!
Why don't you come sit with us?
Really? You don't mind?
Nah. Park it here.
Gee, this is great.
I mean, you know, it's an honor to be included in your...
- Mole!
- Forgive me.
I could not resist.
Hey, Milo, don't you ever close that book?
Yeah, you must've read it a dozen times by now.
I know, but this...
This doesn't make any sense.
See, in this passage here, the shepherd seems to be leading up to something.
He calls it the heart of Atlantis.
It could be the power source the legends refer to.
But then, it just... It cuts off.
It's almost like there's a missing page.
Kid, relax.
We don't get paid overtime.
I know, I know.
Sometimes I get a little carried away.
But hey, you know, that's what this is all about, right?
I mean, discovery, teamwork, adventure.
Unless, maybe...
You're just in it for the money.
- Money.
- Money.
I'm gonna say... Money.
Well, I guess
I set myself up for that one.
What, is something wrong with your neck?
Oh, yeah, I must've hurt it when...
Better?
Yeah!
Hey, how'd you learn how to do that?
- An Arapaho medicine man.
- Get outta here.
Born and raised with 'em.
My father was an army medic.
He settled down in the Kansas
Territory after he met my mother.
- No kidding.
- Nope.
I got a sheepskin from Howard U, and a bearskin from old Iron Cloud.
Halfway through medical school,
I was drafted.
One day I'm studying gross anatomy in the classroom, the next, I'm sewing up Rough Riders on San Juan Hill.
Main course.
I couldn't eat another bite.
I'm watching my weight.
Don't you worry.
It'll keep and keep and keep.
Thank God I lost my sense of taste years ago.
Aren't you going to pitch up your tent?
I did.
I guess I'm still a little rusty at this.
I haven't gone camping since...
Well, since the last time my grandpa took me.
I never got to meet your grandfather.
What was he like?
Where do you start?
He was like a father to me, really.
My parents died when I was a little kid, and he took me in.
What?
Well, I was just thinking.
One time, when I was eight, we were hiking along this stream, and I saw something shining in the water.
It was a genuine arrowhead.
Well, you'd think I'd found a lost civilization the way Grandpa carried on about it.
It wasn't until I was older that I realized that the arrowhead was just some compressed shale mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured into an isosceletic triangulate.
That is so cute!
Say, Audrey, no offense, but how does a teenager become the chief mechanic of a multimillion dollar expedition?
Well, I took this job when my dad retired.
But the funny thing was he always wanted sons, right?
One to run his machine shop and the other to be middleweight boxing champion.
But he got my sister and me instead.
So, what happened to your sister?
She's 24-0 with a shot at the title next month.
Anyway, I'm saving up so my papi and I can open another shop.
Forget your jammies, Mrs. Packard?
I sleep in the nude.
You're gonna want a pair of these.
She sleepwalks.
Well, as far as me goes,
I just like to blow things up.
Come on, Vinny, tell the kid the truth.
My family owned a flower shop.
We would sell roses, carnations, baby's breath, you name it.
One day, I'm making about three dozen corsages for this prom.
You know, the one they put on their wrist.
And everybody, they come.
"Where is it?"
"When is it?"
"Does it match my dress?"
It's a nightmare.
Anyway, I guess there was this leak next door of gas or what. Boom!
No more Chinese laundry.
Blew me right through the front window.
It was like a sign from God.
I found myself that boom.
What's Mole's story?
Trust me on this one.
You don't wanna know.
Audrey, don't tell him. You shouldn't have told me, but you did.
And now, I'm telling you, you don't wanna know.
The redhead's got a gun.
Holy...
Fire.
Fire!
I'm gonna kill him.
Thatch, go back to bed.
Get some water on that fire!
No time!
Get us into those caves!
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Gertie, pull!
Milo, jump! Right now!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
All right, who's not dead? Sound off.
Danged lightning bugs done bit me on my sit upon.
Somebody's gonna have to suck out that poison.
Now, don't everybody jump up at once.
Audrey, give me a damage report.
Not as bad as it could have been.
We totaled rigs two and seven, but the digger looks like it'll still run.
Lucky for us we landed in something soft.
Pumice ash.
We are standing at the base of a dormant volcano.
It just keeps going.
Maybe that's our ticket outta here.
Maybe not.
The magma has solidified in the bowels of the volcano, effectively blocking the exit.
I got the same problem with sauerkraut.
Hold on. Back up.
Are you saying this whole volcano can blow at any time?
No, no, no, no.
That would take an explosive force of great magnitude.
Maybe I should do this later?
If we could blow the top off of that thing, we'd have a straight shot to the surface.
Mr. Thatch, what do you think?
Mr. Thatch?
Thatch?
Hey, wait!
Who are you? Where are you going?
Come back!
Hey, wait a minute!
Who are you?
Sweet mother of Jefferson Davis!
It's beautiful.
Milo, I gotta hand it to you.
You really came through.
I take that back.
Holy cats! Who are these guys?
- They gotta be Atlanteans.
- What? That's impossible!
I seen this back in the Dakota.
They can smell fear just by looking at ya.
So, keep quiet.
I think it's talking to you.
Parlez-vous français?
Oui, monsieur!
They speak my language!
Pardon, mademoiselle.
Voulez-vous...
I like her.
'Bout time someone hit him.
I'm just sorry it wasn't me.
How do they know all these languages?
Their language must be based on a root dialect.
It's just like the Tower of Babel.
Well, maybe English is in there somewhere.
We are explorers from the surface world.
We come in peace.
Welcome to the city of Atlantis.
Come. You must speak with my father now.
Squad "B," head back to the shaft and salvage what you can.
- Yes, sir!
- We'll rendezvous in 24 hours.
Let's move it. You heard him.
I'm so excited!
Now, what's really amazing is that if you deconstructed Latin, you overlaid it with a little Sumerian, throw in a dash of Thessalonian, you'd be getting close to their basic grammatical structure.
Or at least you'd be in the same ballpark...
- Someone's having a good time.
- Like a kid at Christmas.
Commander, there were not supposed to be people down here.
This changes everything.
This changes nothing.
Take that, Mr. Harcourt!
Your Majesty?
On behalf of my crew, may I say it is an honor to be welcomed to your city.
Excuse me? Commander?
You presume much to think you are welcome here.
Oh, sir, we have come a long way looking for...
I know what you seek, and you will not find it here.
Your journey has been in vain.
But we are peaceful explorers, men of science.
And yet you bring weapons.
Our weapons allow us to remove obstacles we may encounter.
Some obstacles cannot be removed with a mere show of force.
Return to your people.
You must leave Atlantis at once.
Oh, Your Majesty, be reasonable.
- Sir...
- Not now, son.
Trust me on this.
We better do as he says.
May I respectfully request that we stay one night, sir?
That would give us time to rest, resupply, and be ready to travel by morning.
Very well. One night.
That is all.
Well, thank you, Your Majesty.
Your heart has softened, Kida.
A thousand years ago, you would have slain them on sight.
A thousand years ago, the streets were lit, and our people did not have to scavenge for food at the edge of a crumbling city!
The people are content.
They do not know any better!
We were once a great people.
Now we live in ruins.
The kings of our past would weep if they could see how far we have fallen.
- Kida.
- If these outsiders can unlock the secrets of our past, perhaps we can save our future.
What they have to teach us we have already learned.
Our way of life is dying.
Our way of life is preserved.
Kida, when you take the throne, you will understand.
- So, how'd it go?
- Well, the King and his daughter don't exactly see eye to eye.
She seems to like us okay, but the King...
I don't know. I think he's hiding something.
Well, if he's hiding something,
I want to know what it is.
- Someone needs to talk to that girl.
- I will go!
- Someone with good people skills.
- I will do it!
- Someone who won't scare her away.
- I volunteer!
Someone who can speak the language.
For the good of the mission, I will go!
Good man, Thatch.
Thanks for volunteering.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Okay, Milo, don't take no for an answer.
"Look, I have some questions for you,
"and I'm not leaving this city until they're answered!" Yeah, that's it.
That's good, that's good.
I have some questions for you, and you are not leaving this city until they are answered.
- Yeah, well, I... Okay.
- Come with me.
Oh, there is so much to ask about your world.
You are a scholar, are you not?
Judging from your diminished physique and large forehead, you are suited for nothing else.
What is your country of origin?
When did the flood waters recede?
- How did you...
- Wait a minute.
I got a few questions for you, too.
So let's do this, okay?
You ask one, then I'll ask one, then you, then me, then...
Well, you get it.
Very well. What is your first question?
Well, okay, how did you get here?
Well, I mean, not you, personally, but your culture.
I mean, how did all of this end up down here?
It is said that the gods became jealous of Atlantis.
They sent a great cataclysm and banished us here.
All I can remember is the sky going dark and people shouting and running.
Then, a bright light, like a star floating above the city.
My father said it called my mother to it.
I never saw her again.
I'm sorry. If it's any consolation,
I know how you feel, because I lost my...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Back up!
What are you telling me?
That you remember because you were there?
No, that's... That's impossible...
Because, I mean, that would make you...
You know, 8,500-8,800 years old.
Yes.
Oh, well. Hey. Looking good.
Just...
- You got another question for me?
- Yes.
How is it you found your way to this place?
Well, I'll tell you, it wasn't easy.
If it weren't for this book, we never would have made it.
Okay, second question. Legend has it that your people possessed a power source of some kind that enabled them...
- You mean you can understand this?
- Yes, I'm a linguist.
That's what I do, that's my job.
- Now, getting back to my question...
- This, right here, you can read this?
Yes, yes.
I can read Atlantean, just like you.
You can't, can you?
No one can.
Such knowledge has been lost to us since the time of the mehbehlmoak.
Oh, the Great Flood.
- Show me.
- Okay...
"Follow the narrow passage for another league."
"There, you will find the fifth marker."
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
How was my accent?
Boorish, provincial...
- And you speak it through your nose.
- Yeah, gotta work on that.
Here, let me show you something.
What? It looks like some sort of vehicle.
Yes. But no matter what I try, it will not respond.
- Perhaps if...
- Way ahead of you.
Okay, let's see what we got here.
Okay. "Place crystal into slot."
Yes, yes, I have done that!
"Gently place your hand on the inscription pad."
- Yes!
- Okay, did you turn the crystal
- one-quarter turn back?
- Yes. Yes!
While your hand was on the inscription pad?
No.
Well. See, there's your problem right there.
That's an easy thing to miss.
You know, you deserve credit for even getting this far.
Okay, give it a try.
Yeah, you got that right.
This is great! With this thing,
I could see the whole city in no time at all.
Wonder how fast it goes.
So, who's hungry?
By the way, we were never properly introduced.
My name's Milo.
My name is Kidagakash.
Kidamaschnaga.
Hey, you got a nickname?
Kida.
Okay, Kida. I can remember that.
What is wrong?
Oh, it's nothing. I just...
Got something in my eye.
You know, my grandpa used to tell me stories about this place as far back as I can remember.
I just wish he could be standing here with me.
Tell me more about your companions.
Your physician, he is called Cookie?
- No, that's Sweet.
- What is?
The doctor. He's Sweet.
Oh, he is kindly.
No, no, no, that's... That's his name.
- His name is Kindly?
- No, Sweet.
Well, I mean, he's kindly, too.
So all of your doctors are sweet and kindly?
No. Well, I'm sure some are.
Ours is, but that's not a requirement.
- You're missing the point.
- You are confusing me.
Look at all those tattoos.
Shoot. That ain't nothing.
Look here what I got.
All 38 United States.
Watch me make Rhode Island dance.
Go on, baby, dance. Dance.
There you go.
Cookies are sweet, but yours is not.
Sweet is kindly, but that is not his name.
Audrey is sweet, but she is not your doctor.
And the little digging animal called Mole...
He is your pet?
Close enough.
Oh, don't forget to eat the head.
That's where all the nutrients are.
You know, Kida, the most we ever hoped to find was some crumbling buildings, maybe some broken pottery.
Instead, we find a living, thriving society.
These guys are kinda cute when they're not, you know, formed into a fiery column of death.
We are not thriving.
True, our people live, but our culture is dying.
We are like a stone the ocean beats against.
With each passing year, a little more of us is worn away.
I wish there was something I could do.
I have brought you to this place to ask you for your help.
There is a mural here with writing all around the pictures.
Yeah, well, you came to the right guy.
Okay, let me see.
Let's start with this column right here.
Well, this... Kida?
- What are you doing?
- You do swim, do you not?
Oh, I swim, pretty girl.
Pretty good! Pretty good.
Good, swim good.
Pretty good. I swim pretty good.
Good. It is a fair distance to where we are going.
Hey, you are talking to the belly flop champ at Camp Runamuck.
Come on, we're wasting time.
Why don't you lead the way, because
I have no idea where we're going.
- Are you all right?
- Well, I didn't drown, so...
Good. Follow me.
This is amazing!
A complete history of Atlantis!
It's just like Plato described it.
Well, he was off on a few details, but...
The light I saw.
The star in the middle of the city.
What does the writing say about that?
I don't know yet.
But we're gonna find out.
Come on.
- The heart of Atlantis!
- What?
It's the heart of Atlantis! That's what the shepherd was talking about.
It wasn't a star, it was...
It was some kind of crystal.
Like these! Don't you get it?
The power source I've been looking for, the bright light you remember.
- They're the same thing!
- That cannot be.
It's what's keeping all these things...
You, all of Atlantis alive.
Then where is it now?
I don't know, I don't know.
You'd think something this important would have been in the Journal, but...
Unless... The missing page.
You have a nice swim?
Hey, guys, what's going on?
What's... What's with all the guns?
Guys?
I am such an idiot.
This is just another treasure hunt for you.
- You're after the crystal.
- Oh, you mean this?
The heart of Atlantis.
Yeah. About that,
I would've told you sooner, but it was strictly on a need-to-know basis.
And, well, now you know.
I had to be sure you were one of us.
Welcome to the club, son.
I'm no mercenary.
Mercenary?
I prefer the term "adventure capitalist."
Besides, you're the one who got us here.
You led us right to the treasure chest.
You don't know what you're tampering with, Rourke.
What's to know? It's big. It's shiny.
It's going to make us all rich.
You think it's some kind of a diamond,
I thought it was some kind of a battery, but we're both wrong.
It's their life force.
That crystal is the only thing keeping these people alive.
You take that away, and they'll die.
Well, that changes things.
- Helga, what do you think?
- Knowing that, I'd double the price.
I was thinking triple.
Rourke, don't do this.
Academics. You never want to get your hands dirty.
Think about it.
If you gave back every stolen artifact from a museum, you'd be left with an empty building.
We're just providing a necessary service to the archeological community.
Not interested.
I got to admit, I'm disappointed.
You're an idealist, just like your grandfather.
Do yourself a favor, Milo.
Don't be like him.
For once, do the smart thing.
I really hate it when negotiations go sour.
Let's try this again.
- Knock, knock.
- Room service.
Tell them to drop their weapons... Now!
Spread out! Search everywhere!
You're not applying yourself, son.
There's got to be something else.
Well, there isn't. It just says,
"The heart of Atlantis lies in the eyes of her king."
Well, then maybe Old King Cole here can help us fill in the blanks.
How about it, chief?
Where's the crystal chamber?
You will destroy yourselves.
Maybe I'm not being clear.
Rourke, this was not a part of the plan.
Plan's changed, doc.
I'd suggest you put a bandage on that bleeding heart of yours.
It doesn't suit a mercenary.
Well, as usual, diplomacy has failed us.
Now, I'm going to count to 10.
And you're going to tell me where the crystal is.
One...
Two...
Nine...
T...
The heart of Atlantis lies in the eyes of her king.
This is it. We're in.
Rourke, for the last time, you've got to listen to me.
You don't have the slightest idea what this power is capable of.
True, but I can think of a few countries who'd pay anything to find out.
Hurry. Get on.
Jackpot.
The kings of our past.
Thatch, tell her to wrap it up.
We got a schedule to meet.
Kida...
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's get this over with.
I don't like this place.
All right, Thatch, what's next?
Okay, there's a giant crystal hovering 150 feet above our heads over a bottomless pit of water.
Doesn't anything surprise you?
The only thing that surprises me is you're still talking and that thing's not on the truck yet.
- Now move it!
- I don't know how to move it.
I don't even know what's holding it up there.
Talk to me, Thatch. What's happening?
Look, all it says here is that the crystal is alive, somehow.
I don't know how to explain it.
It's their deity. It's their power source.
Speak English, professor.
They're a part of it. It's a part of them.
I'm doing the best I can here.
- Well, do better.
- Oh, I know.
Why don't you translate, and I'll wave the gun around?
What did she say?
I don't know. I didn't catch it.
Hold your horses, lover boy.
Kida.
No, don't. Don't touch her.
All right, step back.
Sergeant, keep those people back.
You heard him. Step back.
I'm warning you.
So...
I guess this is how it ends?
Fine. You win.
You're wiping out an entire civilization, but hey... You'll be rich.
Congratulations, Audrey.
Guess you and your dad will be able to open up that second garage after all.
And, Vinny, you can start a whole chain of flower shops.
I'm sure your family's going to be very proud.
But that's what it's all about, right?
- Money.
- Get off your soapbox, Thatch.
You've read Darwin.
It's called natural selection.
We're just helping it along.
- Commander, we're ready.
- Yeah, give me a minute.
I know I'm forgetting something.
I got the cargo, the crystal, the crew...
Oh, yeah.
Look at it this way, son.
You were the man who discovered Atlantis, and now, you're part of the exhibit.
Let's move, people.
That was an order, not a suggestion. Let's go!
We're all going to die.
Oh, you can't be serious.
This is wrong, and you know it.
We're this close to our biggest payday ever, and you pick now of all times to grow a conscience.
We've done a lot of things we're not proud of, robbing graves, plundering tombs, double parking, but nobody got hurt.
Well, maybe somebody got hurt, but nobody we knew.
Well, if that's the way you want it, fine.
More for me.
P.T. Barnum was right.
- We can't let him do this!
- Wait a second.
Okay, now you can go.
Milo, you better get up here.
How's he doing?
Not good, I'm afraid.
Internal bleeding.
There's nothing more I can do.
What a nightmare.
- And I brought it here.
- Don't go beating yourself up.
He's been after that crystal since Iceland.
The crystal. Sweet, that's it.
These... These crystals, they have some sort of healing energy.
I've seen it work.
No.
Where is my daughter?
Well, she...
She has been chosen, like her mother before her.
What?
In times of danger, the crystal will choose a host, one of royal blood, to protect itself and its people.
It will accept no other.
Wait a minute. Choose?
So this thing is alive?
In a way.
The crystal thrives on the collective emotions of all who came before us.
In return, it provides power, longevity, protection.
As it grew, it developed a consciousness of its own.
In my arrogance,
I sought to use it as a weapon of war, but it's power proved too great to control.
It overwhelmed us and led to our destruction.
That's why you hid it beneath the city.
To keep history from repeating itself.
And to prevent Kida from suffering the same fate as my beloved wife.
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Kida?
If she remains bonded to the crystal, she could be lost to it forever.
The love of my daughter is all I have left.
My burden would have become hers when the time was right, but now, it falls to you.
Me?
Return the crystal.
Save Atlantis.
Save my daughter.
So, what's it going to be?
- Excuse me?
- I followed you in, and I'll follow you out.
- It's your decision.
- Oh, my decision?
Well, I think we've seen how effective my decisions have been.
Let's recap.
I lead a band of plundering vandals to the greatest archeological find in recorded history, thus enabling the kidnap and/or murder of the royal family.
Not to mention personally delivering the most powerful force known to man into the hands of a mercenary nutcase who's probably going to sell it to the Kaiser!
Have I left anything out?
Well, you did set the camp on fire
- and drop us down that big hole.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Of course, it's been my experience when you hit bottom, the only place left to go is up.
Who told you that?
A fella by the name of Thaddeus Thatch.
Where are you going?
- I'm going after Rourke.
- Milo, that's crazy.
I didn't say it was the smart thing.
But it is the right thing.
Come on. We better make sure he doesn't hurt himself.
Milo, what do you think you are doing?
Just follow my lead.
I'm impressed.
It's simple. All you got to do...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up. We get it, okay?
No, no, wait!
Gently. Just gently.
Hey, Milo, you got something sporty?
You know, like a tuna?
- How is this done?
- All you got to do is use the crystals.
Kida showed me.
Half-turn right, quarter-turn back.
Keep your hand on the pad.
Saddle up, partners.
Bring jerky and ammo.
I'm so excited.
All right, this is it!
We're going to rescue the princess.
We're going to save Atlantis.
Or we're going to die trying.
Now let's do it!
I love it when I win.
Okay, here's the plan.
We're going to come in low and fast and take them by surprise.
Well, I've got news for you, Milo.
Rourke is never surprised, and he's got a lot of guns.
Great. Well, do you have any suggestions?
Yeah. Don't get shot.
There they are!
We've got company!
Take off!
Take her up!
Holy smokes!
You told me he only had guns.
What I said was, he's never surprised.
Okay, now things are getting good.
Vinny! Heads up!
We can't let them reach the top of that shaft!
Vinny, new plan.
You and me, we're going to be decoys.
Audrey, Sweet, fly up underneath that thing and cut her loose.
We're on it.
Lieutenant!
I thought you said this thing could cut through a femur in 28 seconds!
Less talk, more saw.
Looks like somebody's working overtime.
Come on, girl. Time's up.
All right, Milo, this is it.
Any last words?
Yeah. I really wish I had a better idea than this!
We're losing altitude.
Lighten the load.
That's it, unless someone wants to jump.
Ladies first.
You said we were in this together!
You promised me a percentage!
Next time, get it in writing.
Nothing personal.
Well, I have to hand it to you.
You're a bigger pain in the neck than I would have ever thought possible.
I consider myself an even-tempered man.
It takes a lot to get under my skin.
But congratulations, you just won the solid-gold kewpie doll.
Nothing personal.
Tired, Mr. Thatch?
That's a darn shame because I'm just getting warmed up.
Thank heaven.
Oh, great!
The volcano... She awakes!
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
This here would be a good place not to be.
No, wait. We got to get her back or the whole city will die.
And if we don't get out of here, we'll die.
It's the only way to reverse this.
Just do it!
Milo, no!
Go!
The fissure, it is about to eject its pyroclastic fury!
Milo, Mole says the wall's going to blow!
Milo?
Atlantis will honor your names forever.
I only wish there was more we could do for you.
You know, thanks anyway, but I think we're good.
They'll take you as far as the surface.
We are really going to miss you, Milo.
You know, I'm going to reopen the flower shop, and I'm going to think of you guys every single day,
Monday through Friday, 9:00 to 5:00,
Saturday until 2:00.
Sunday... I'm going to take Sunday off, probably, and...
Maybe I'll go in for a couple of hours, you know.
But August... I'm going to take August.
I ain't so good at speechifying, but I wanted you to have this.
It's the bacon grease from the whole trip.
Cookie, I...
Two for flinching.
See you, Milo.
Hey, Milo!
Mole.
Mole. Hey, well...
Good-bye, Mole.
Now, you sure you want to stay?
There's a hero's welcome waiting for the man who discovered Atlantis.
I don't think the world needs another hero.
Besides, I hear there's an opening down here for an expert in gibberish.
You take good care of yourself, Milo Thatch.
Yeah. You, too, Sweet.
Come here.
Sweet, before you go, could you...
No problem.
Thanks.
Oh, you're getting a bill.
Can we go home now?
Come on, y'all. Let's get one last shot in front of the fish.
- Say gochk!
- Gochk!
Now, let's go over it again, just so we got it straight.
- You didn't find anything?
- Nope. Just a lot of rocks...
And fish, little fish.
Sponges.
What happened to Helga?
Well, we lost her when a flaming zeppelin come down on her.
- Missing.
- That's right. And Rourke?
Nervous breakdown.
You could say he went all to pieces.
In fact, you could say he was transamorgafied and then busted into a zillion...
He's missing, too.
- What about Milo?
- Went down with the sub.
Lord, give me strength.
I'm going to miss that boy.
At least he's in a better place now.
Dear Mr. Whitmore,
I hope this piece of proof is enough for you.
It sure convinced me.
Thanks from both of us.
They'll try to hold you back
And they will say you're wrong
But they will never understand
The journey that you're on
They'll try to change your mind
They'll try to change your heart
Oh, yeah
But they will never understand
Who you are
And you'll still believe
Still believe
And you know
And you know
You must go
You must go
Where the dream takes you
Where you can take your heart
Where your heart longs to be
Your dream will lead you on
When you finally find that place
You'll find all you need
Where the dream takes you
Oh, yeah
There's something in your soul
Something in your soul
That won't be denied
It's the faith to dream that keeps
The dream alive
So you'll still believe
Still believe
And you know
You must go
Where the dream takes you
Where your dream takes your heart
Where your heart longs to be
Your dream will lead you on
When you finally find that place
You'll find all you need
Where the dream takes you
Go where your heart is meant to be
And you may find
Somebody there
Someone to share your dream
All right, all right
Your dream will lead you on
When you finally find that place
You'll find all you need
Where the dream leads you
Your dream will lead you on
Far as your heart can see
Your dream will lead you on
Oh, yes
There's a world that waits for you
You're not alone
You'll find your home
Where the dream takes you
Try to change your mind
Where the dream takes you
Try to change your heart
Where the dream takes you
But you must go
Cinderella
You're as lovely as your name
Cinderella
You're a sunset in a frame
Though you're dressed in rags
You wear an air of queenly grace
Anyone can see
A throne would be your proper place
Cinderella
If you give your heart a chance
It will lead you
To the kingdom of romance
There you'll see your dreams unfold
Cinderella
In the sweetest story
Ever told
Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a tiny kingdom, peaceful, prosperous, and rich in romance and tradition.
Here, in a stately chateau, there lived a widowed gentleman and his little daughter, Cinderella.
Although he was a kind and devoted father, and gave his beloved child every luxury and comfort, still, he felt she needed a mother's care.
And so, he married again, choosing for his second wife a woman of good family, with two daughters just Cinderella's age, by name, Anastasia and Drizella.
It was upon the untimely death of this good man, however, that the stepmother's true nature was revealed.
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous of Cinderella's charm and beauty, she was grimly determined to forward the interests of her own two awkward daughters.
Thus, as time went by, the chateau fell into disrepair.
For the family fortunes were squandered upon the vain and selfish stepsisters, while Cinderella was abused, humiliated, and finally forced to become a servant in her own house.
And yet, through it all,
Cinderella remained ever gentle and kind.
For with each dawn, she found new hope that someday her dreams of happiness would come true.
Well, it serves you right, spoiling people's best dreams.
Yes, I know it's a lovely morning, but it was a lovely dream, too.
What kind of a dream?
Can't tell.
'Cause if you tell a wish, it won't come true.
And, after all...
A dream is a wish
Your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose
Your heartaches
Whatever you wish for
You keep
Have faith
In your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
Oh, that clock.
Old killjoy.
I hear you. "Come on, get up," you say.
Time to start another day.
Even he orders me around.
Well, there's one thing.
They can't order me to stop dreaming.
And perhaps someday...
The dreams that I wish
Will come true
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
- Look what I found.
- Over there, Cinderella.
Wait a minute.
One at a time, please.
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?
New mouse in the house.
Brand-new. Never saw it before.
- Visitor. Visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.
Well, she'll need a dress...
- No, no, no.
- It's not a she, it's a he.
- He, he.
- Oh, that does make a difference.
- He'll need a jacket and shoes...
- Gotta get him out!
- It's in a rat trap.
- Where?
In a trap? Why didn't you say so?
Now, now, calm down, everybody.
Oh, the poor little thing's scared to death.
Jaq, maybe you better explain things to him.
Zuk, zuk, Cinderelly.
Now, now. Look, little guy.
Take it easy. Nothin' to worry about.
We like you. Cinderelly likes you, too.
She's nice, very nice.
That's better. Come on, now. Zuk, zuk.
Zuk, zuk.
Well, that's better.
Well, let's just slip it on for size.
It is a little snug.
But it'll have to do.
Now, for a name.
I've got one. Octavius.
But for short, we'll call you Gus.
Like it, Gus? Like it? Like it?
Gus-Gus.
I've got to hurry.
See he keeps out of trouble, Jaq.
And don't forget to warn him about the cat.
Zuk, zuk. Look, did you ever see a cat?
Cat, cat?
Cat, cat. Lucifer. That's him.
Meany, sneaky.
Jump at you. Bite at you.
Big, big. Big as a house.
Zuk, zuk, Lucify?
Lucify, zuk, zuk.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Come, kitty. Come on.
Lucifer! Come here!
I'm sorry if Your Highness objects to an early breakfast.
It's certainly not my idea to feed you first.
It's orders. Come on.
Lucify. Is that Lucify?
Zuk, Lucify. That's him.
Gus-Gus take the Lucify and look at!
No, Gus-Gus, no.
Now, listen here. Lucify not funny.
Lucify mean.
Bruno.
Bruno!
Dreaming again.
Chasing Lucifer?
Catch him this time? That's bad.
Suppose they heard you upstairs.
You know the orders.
So if you don't want to lose that nice, warm bed, you'd better get rid of those dreams.
Know how?
Just learn to like cats.
No, I mean it.
Lucifer has his good points, too.
For one thing, he...
Well, sometimes he...
There must be something good about him.
Bruno!
Oh, Bruno.
Come on, now. Outside.
I know it isn't easy, but at least we should try to get along together.
And that includes you, Your Majesty.
Breakfast time.
Everybody up. Hurry, hurry.
Come on, everybody, breakfast, breakfast.
Come on, let's eat breakfast.
Breakfast? Breakfast!
Lucify. How're we gonna get out?
Let's see.
Listen, ibby-dibby. Got an idea.
Now, somebody's got to sneak out, get Lucify to chase him, run over to the corner and keep Lucify there.
Then we all run out. Zuk.
Yuk, yuk. Out.
Now we choose the one to do it.
Ibby-dibby hop.
- Hop.
- Hop.
- Ready, hop.
- Hop.
Hop.
- Now...
- Hop, hop, hop.
Hop.
Oh, there you are.
I was wondering.
All right. Breakfast is served.
Take it easy, cluck-cluck.
Let go! Let go, now.
Stop that. Go on, shoo, shoo.
Shoo, shoo, shoo!
Poor little Gus.
Here.
Help yourself.
Where's Gus-Gus?
Well, guess he got away.
Cinderella!
All right, all right. I'm coming.
Oh, my goodness.
Morning, noon, and night.
Cinderella!
Coming, coming.
- Cinderella!
- I'm coming.
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.
Cinderella!
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?
As if you care.
Take that ironing and have it back in an hour.
One hour, you hear?
Yes, Drizella.
Good morning, Anastasia.
Well, it's about time.
Don't forget the mending.
Don't be all day getting it done, either.
Yes, Anastasia.
Well, come in, child, come in.
Good morning, Stepmother.
Pick up the laundry and get on with your duties.
Yes, Stepmother.
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother!
Mother! Mother!
You did it. You did it on purpose.
Mother! Mother! Mother!
Now what did you do?
She put it there.
A big, ugly mouse, under my teacup.
All right, Lucifer.
What did you do with him?
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.
We'll just see about this.
Come on. Let him go.
Now the other one.
Come on!
Oh, poor little Gus.
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?
Cinderella!
Yes, Stepmother.
Are you gonna get it.
Close the door, Cinderella.
Come here.
- You don't think that I...
- Hold your tongue.
Now, it seems we have time on our hands.
- But I was only trying to...
- Silence!
Time for vicious practical jokes.
Perhaps we can put it to better use.
Now, let me see...
There's the large carpet in the main hall.
Clean it!
And the windows, upstairs and down.
Wash them!
Oh, yes.
And the tapestries and the draperies.
- But I just finished...
- Do them again!
And don't forget the garden.
Scrub the terrace.
Sweep the halls and the stairs.
Clean the chimneys.
And, of course, there's the mending and the sewing and the laundry.
Oh, yes. And one more thing.
See that Lucifer gets his bath.
My son has been avoiding his responsibilities long enough.
It's high time he married and settled down.
Of course, Your Majesty.
But we must be patient.
I am patient!
But I'm not getting any younger, you know.
I want to see my grandchildren before I go.
- I understand, Sire.
- No.
No, you don't know what it means to see your only child grow farther, farther, and farther away from you.
I'm...
I'm lonely in this desolate old palace.
I... I want to hear the pitter-patter of little feet again.
Now, now, Your Majesty.
- Perhaps if we just let him alone...
- Let him alone?
With his silly romantic ideas?
But, Sire, in matters of love...
Love.
Just a boy meeting a girl under the right conditions.
So, we're arranging the conditions.
But, Your Majesty, if the Prince should suspect.
Suspect!
Look, the boy's coming home today, isn't he?
Yes, Sire.
Well, what could be more natural than a ball to celebrate his return?
Nothing, Sire.
If all the eligible maidens in my kingdom just happened to be there, why, he's bound to show interest in one of them, isn't he?
Isn't he?
Yes, Sire.
The moment he does...
Soft lights.
Romantic music.
All the trimmings!
It can't possibly fail.
Can it?
Yes, Sire. No, Sire!
Very well, Sire.
I shall arrange the ball for...
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Tonight!
- Oh, but, Sire...
- Tonight!
And see that every eligible maid is there.
Understand?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The pear-shaped toad
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
Above me
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
Above
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet nightingale

Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet

Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Sing, sweet
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

Oh, sing, sweet nightingale
Oh, sing, sweet
Oh

Lucifer!
You mean old thing.
I'm just going to have to teach you a lesson.
Open in the name of the King.
An urgent message from His Imperial Majesty.
- Thank you.
- From the King!
What's it say, Cinderelly?
What's it say?
I don't know.
He said it's urgent.
Maybe I should interrupt the music lesson.
Sing, sweet nightingale
High
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.
- It's her fault.
- Girls, girls. Remember, above all, self-control.
Yes!
Cinderella!
I've warned you never to interrupt...
- This just arrived from the palace.
- From the palace!
- Give it here.
- Let me have it.
I'll read it.
Well, there's to be a ball.
- A ball!
- In honour of His Highness, the Prince.
Oh, the Prince!
And, by royal command, every eligible maiden is to attend.
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible.
That means I can go, too.
Her, dancing with the Prince.
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.
Would you mind holding my broom?
Well, why not?
After all, I'm still a member of the family.
And it says, "By royal command",
"every eligible maiden is to attend."
Yes, so it does.
Well, I see no reason why you can't go.
If you get all your work done.
Oh, I will. I promise.
And if you can find something suitable to wear.
I'm sure I can.
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.
Mother, do you realise what you just said?
Of course.
I said "if."
Oh. "If."
Isn't it lovely?
- It was my mother's.
- It's pretty, but it looks old.
Well, maybe it is old-fashioned, but I'll fix that.
- How do you do it?
- Wait a minute.
There ought to be some good ideas in here.
This one.
Oh, very nice. Nice.
- Like it.
- It'll be easy.
I'll have to shorten the sleeves,
I'll need a sash,
- a ruffle, something for a collar...
- Cinderella!
Oh, now what do they want?
Cinderella!
Oh, well.
I guess my dress will just have to wait.
Cinderella!
All right, all right. I'm coming.
Poor Cinderelly.
Every time she finds a minute, that's the time when they begin it.
Cinderelly, Cinderelly.
Cinderella!
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire
Fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes
Do the moppin'
And the sweepin' and the dustin'
They always keep her hoppin'
She'd go around in circles
Till she's very, very dizzy
- Still they holler
- Keep her busy, Cinderelly
Yeah. Keep her busy.
You know what?
- Cinderelly won't go to the ball.
- What?
- Not go?
- What did you say?
You'll see. They'll fix her.
Work, work, work.
She'll never get her dress done.
Poor Cinderelly.
Hey! We can do it!
We can do it
We can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make the dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball she'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we make for Cinderelly
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We got to get it goin'
I'll cut it with the scissors.
And I can do the sewing.
Leave the sewing to the women.
You go get some trimmin'.
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo
We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly
Follow me, Gus-Gus.
I know where to go.
It's gonna be pretty, this dress.
Cinderelly will be surprised.
Surprised, surprised. Very surprised.
And this, too, my slippers.
Don't forget...
- Take my dress.
- Here, mend the buttonholes.
- Press my skirt and mind the ruffle.
- Cinderella?
- Yes?
- When you're through, and before you begin your regular chores,
I have a few little things.
Very well.
I don't see why everyone else has nice things to wear, and I always end up in these old rags.
This sash! I wouldn't be seen dead in it.
You should talk. These beads!
I am sick of looking at them.
- Trash.
- Oh, I hate this.
Come on and be careful.
Yes, yes, yes. Real careful.
We can use that, Gus-Gus.
Pretty, pretty.
Look out. Lucify!
Beads!
Very pretty beads!
A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for
You keep
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true
Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Whatever you wish for you keep
All right.
Heave, ho. Heave, ho.
Heave, ho.
The dream that you wish will come true
Will come true
- Yes?
- The carriage is here.
Why, Cinderella,
- you're not ready, child.
- I'm not going.
Not going? Oh, what a shame.
But, of course, there will be other times.
Yes. Good night.
Oh, well.
What's a royal ball?
After all, I suppose it would be frightfully dull, and boring, and completely...
Completely wonderful.
- It's my...
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!
- No, no, no, no!
Well, I never dreamed it.
It's such a surprise.
Oh, how can I ever...
Oh, thank you so much.
Remember, when you're presented to His Highness,
- be sure...
- Wait!
Please, wait for me.
Isn't it lovely? Do you like it?
Do you think it will do?
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't.
- Oh, no.
- You can't!
Girls, please.
After all, we did make a bargain.
Didn't we, Cinderella?
And I never go back on my word.
How very clever.
These beads, they give it just the right touch.
Don't you think so, Drizella?
No, I don't. I think she's...
Why, you little thief!
They're my beads. Give them here.
Oh, no.
And look, that's my sash.
She's wearing my sash.
- Mine!
- Oh, please.
Please, no.
Thief!
Girls, girls.
That's quite enough.
Hurry along now, both of you.
I won't have you upsetting yourselves.
Good night.
You will lose your heartache
Whatever you wish for
You'll keep
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.
Have faith in your dreams and someday
It's just no use.
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No use at all.
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
I can't believe. Not any more.
The dream that you wish
Will come true
There's nothing left to believe in.
Nothing.
Nothing, my dear?
- Oh, now you don't really mean that.
- Oh, but I do.
Nonsense, child!
If you'd lost all your faith,
I couldn't be here.
And here I am.
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.
You can't go to the ball looking like that.
The ball?
- Oh, but I'm not...
- Of course, you are.
But we have to hurry, because even miracles take a little time.
- Miracles?
- Watch.
What in the world did I do with that magic wand? I was sure...
Magic wand?
That's strange.
- I always...
- Then you must be...
Your fairy godmother? Of course.
Where is that wand? I...
Oh! I forgot.
I put it away.
Look at what she did.
How'd she do it?
Now, let's see.
I'd say the first thing you need is
- a pumpkin.
- A pumpkin?
Now the magic words.
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put 'em together and what have you got?
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
It'll do magic
Believe it or not
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Now sala-gadoola means
Menchika-boolaroo
But the thing-a-ma-bob that does the job
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put 'em together and what have you got?
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Oh, looky.
Isn't it wonderful?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Yes, isn't it?
With an elegant coach like that, of course, we'll simply have to have
- mice!
- Mice?
Oh, this really is nice.
Why, we'll have a coach and four when we're through.
Just a wave of my stick and to finish the trick, bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Gracious, what did I do?
I was sure there were four.
There should be one more.
There you are.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Oh, poor Lucifer.
Serves him right, I'd say. Now...
Where were we? Oh, goodness, yes.
You can't go to the ball without a horse.
Another one?
But tonight, for a change, you will handle the reins, and sit in the driver's seat, too.
For instead of a horse, you're the coachman, of course.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
That does it, I guess, except for...
Oh, yes!
The finishing touch. And, that's you.
Yes, Bruno, that's right, you'll be footman tonight.
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.
- But...
- No, don't try to thank me.
Oh, I wasn't... I mean, I do, but...
But, don't you think my dress...
Yes, it's lovely, dear.
Good heavens, child.
You can't go in that!
Now, let's see, dear.
Your size and the shade of your eyes.
Something simple, but daring, too.
Oh, just leave it to me.
What a gown this will be.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.
Oh, it's a beautiful dress.
Did you ever see such a beautiful dress?
And, look, glass slippers.
Why, it's like a dream.
A wonderful dream come true.
Yes, my child.
But, like all dreams, well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.
You'll have only till midnight, and then...
Midnight? Thank you.
Now, now, now, just a minute.
You must understand, my dear, on the stroke of 12:00 the spell will be broken, and everything will be as it was before.
Oh, I understand, but it's more than I ever hoped for.
Bless you, my child.
I... Goodness me!
It's getting late.
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.
Have a good time.
Dance, be gay.
Now, off you go.
You're on your way.
With a bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Princess Frederica
Eugenie de la Fontain.
Mademoiselle Augustina DuBois.
Daughter of General Pierre DuBois.
The boy isn't cooperating.
Mademoiselle Leonora
Mercedes de la Tour.
Daughter of Colonel and Madame de la Tour.
I can't understand it.
There must be at least one who'd make a suitable mother.
Sire.
A suitable wife.
Mademoiselles
Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine.
Daughters of Lady Tremaine.
I give up.
Even I couldn't expect the boy to...
Well, if I may say so,
Your Majesty, I did try to warn you, but you, Sire, are incurably romantic.
No doubt you saw the whole pretty picture in detail.
The young Prince bowing to the assembly.
Suddenly he stops. He looks up.
For, lo, there she stands.
The girl of his dreams.
Who she is or whence she came, he knows not, nor does he care, for his heart tells him that here, here is the maid predestined to be his bride.
A pretty plot for fairy tales, Sire.
But in real life, oh, no.
No! It was foredoomed to failure.
Failure, eh?
Take a look at that, you pompous windbag.
Who is she?
- You know her?
- No, Sire.
I've never seen her before.
That's one thing in her favour.
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!
Lights. The lights.
Failure, eh?
Well... Now for a good night's sleep.
Oh, quite so, Sire. I believe I, too...
You will stay right here.
See they're not disturbed, and when the boy proposes, notify me immediately.
Notify me immediately.
And remember, if anything goes wrong...
- Who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?
Well, the Prince certainly seems to.
I know I've never seen her.
Nor I.
But she certainly is... Wait.
There is something familiar about her.
Ahem.
So this is love
So this is what makes life
Divine
I'm all aglow
- And now I know
- And now I know
The key to all Heaven
Is mine
My heart has wings
And I can fly
I'll touch every star
In the sky
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
So this
Is
Love
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
What's the matter?
It's midnight.
Yes, so it is. But why...
- Goodbye.
- No, no, wait.
- You can't go now. It's only...
- Oh, I must. Please.
- Please, I must.
- But why?
Well, I... Oh, the Prince,
I haven't met the Prince.
The Prince?
But didn't you know...
- Goodbye.
- No, wait.
Come back. Please come back.
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?
Wait! Please wait.
Goodbye.
Oh, I say. Young lady.
- Wait!
- The Prince!
Just a moment.
Guard! Guard!
Stop that coach! Close those gates!
Follow that coach!
Open those gates!
I'm sorry.
I guess I forgot about everything.
Even the time, but...
But it was so wonderful.
And he was so handsome, and when we danced...
Oh, I'm sure even the Prince himself couldn't have been more...
More...
- Oh, well, it's over and...
- Cinderelly.
Look, look! The slippers!
Yeah, your slipper.
Your slipper, Cinderelly.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, for everything.
Your Majesty,
I see no point in beating about the bush.
I regret to inform you, Sire, that the young lady has disappeared, leaving behind only this glass slipper.
Yes. I'll do it.
No. I just can't.
Well, come in.
Come in!
- Your Majesty...
- So, he's proposed already?
- Tell me about it.
- Well...
- Who is she?
- I didn't get a chance...
No matter. We've more important things to discuss.
Arrangements for the wedding, invitations, a national holiday.
- All that sort of thing.
- But, Sire...
Here. Have a cigar. Take a few more.
But...
Better practise passing these out, eh?
But, if you'd only listen.
And for you, my friend.
- Your Majesty, please...
- A knighthood.
I hereby dub you Sir...
By the way, what title would you like?
- Sire? She got away.
- Sir "She Got Away"?
A peculiar title, but if that's what you...
She what? Why, you...
You... You traitor!
Now, Sire.
Remember, your blood pressure.
Treason!
No, Sire. No!
Sabotage!
You were in league with the Prince.
I tried to stop her, but she vanished into thin air.
A likely story.
But it's true, Sire.
All we could find was this glass slipper.
The whole thing was a plot!
But, Sire, he loves her.
He won't rest till he finds her.
He's determined to marry her.
What? What did you say?
The Prince, Sire, swears he'll marry none but the girl who fits this slipper.
He said that, did he?
We've got him!
But, Sire, this slipper may fit one of any number of girls.
That's his problem. He's given his word.
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, Your Highness.
I'll have nothing to do with it.
You'll try this on every maid in my kingdom.
And if the shoe fits, bring her in.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Cinderella? Cinderella?
- Cinderella! Where is that...
- Yes?
Here I am.
My daughters, where are they?
I think they're still in bed.
Don't just stand there!
Bring up the breakfast trays at once.
And hurry!
I wonder what's the matter.
What's the matter with her?
I don't know. Let's find out. Come on.
Drizella. Drizella!
What?
Get up. Quick. This instant.
We haven't a moment to lose.
Anastasia.
Get up, Anastasia.
What for? Why?
Everyone's talking about it, the whole kingdom.
- Hurry now. He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?
The Grand Duke.
He's been hunting all night.
- Hunting?
- For that girl.
The one who lost her slipper at the ball last night.
They say he's madly in love with her.
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no. The Prince!
The Prince!
You clumsy little fool.
Clean that up, then help my daughters dress.
What for?
If he's in love with that girl, why should we even bother?
Now, you two, listen to me.
There is still a chance that one of you can get it.
One of us?
Why, Mother, what do you mean?
Just this:
No one, not even the Prince, knows who that girl is.
We know! We know! Cinderelly!
The glass slipper is their only clue.
The Duke has been ordered to try it on every girl in the kingdom.
And if one can be found whom the slipper fits, then, by the King's command, that girl shall be the Prince's bride.
- His bride.
- His bride!
Cinderella, get my things together.
Never mind her. Get mine right away.
What's the matter with her?
- Wake up, stupid.
- We've gotta get dressed.
Dressed. Oh, yes.
Oh, we must get dressed.
It wouldn't do for the Duke to see me...
Mother, did you see what she did?
- Are you just going to let her...
- Quiet!
So this is love
What's she gonna do?
I don't know. Gotta watch.
Come on.
- Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
What?
Oh, no!
No, please!
Oh, you can't, you just can't.
Let me out! You must let me out!
You can't keep me in here!
Oh, please.
No, no. She can't do it.
She can't lock up Cinderelly.
I'm gonna...
Please. Please.
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.
He's over here, the Duke-Duke.
- Yeah, yeah. Who?
- The Grand Duke, with the slipper.
We gotta get that key quick.
Yup, yup. Key, key. Quick.
Oh, Mother, Mother, he's here, he's here.
- The Grand Duke.
- Do I look all right?
- I'm so excited, I don't know what I'll do.
- Girls.
Now, remember, this is your last chance. Don't fail me.
Announcing
His Imperial Grace, the Grand Duke.
You honour our humble home.
Quite so.
May I present my daughters,
Drizella, Anastasia.
Your Grace.
Yes. Charmed, I'm sure.
His Grace will read the royal proclamation.
"All loyal subjects of His Imperial Majesty"
"are hereby notified by royal proclamation in regard to a certain"
"glass slipper."
"It is decreed..."
Why, that's my slipper!
Well, I like that. It's my slipper!
No, no, no! It's Cinderelly's slipper!
- How can she stand there...
- Girls.
Your manners.
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.
Please continue.
Yes, quite so.
Oh, yes.
"It is upon this day decreed"
"that a quest be instituted throughout..."
"The sole and express purpose of such quest to be as follows:"
"That every maid throughout the kingdom without exception,"
"shall try on her foot this slipper of glass,"
"and should one be found upon whose foot this slipper shall properly fit,"
"such maiden shall be acclaimed the object of this search"
"and shall be looked upon as the true love of His Royal Highness,"
"our beloved son and heir, the noble Prince."
"Said Prince will, upon bended knee"
"beg, request, or if need be, implore"
"said maiden that he be granted her hand in marriage."
"Whereupon, should the aforementioned maiden"
"look with favour, shall the couple pledge their troth..."
"And in due course, upon the inevitable demise of His Majesty the King,"
"succeed to the throne to rule over the land"
"as King and Queen of our kingdom."
"So be it."
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.
May we offer you some tea?
What? Tea?
Thank you, madam, no.
We must proceed with the fitting.
Of course. Anastasia, dear.
There. I knew it was my slipper.
Exactly my size.
I always wear the same size.
As soon as I saw it, I said...
Oh, well...
It may be a trifle snug today.
You know how it is, dancing all night.
I can't understand why.
It's always fit perfectly before.
I don't think you're half trying.
Mother, can you...
Quiet, my dear.
We mustn't disturb His Grace.
Young man, are you sure you're trying it on the right foot?
Oh, it's the right foot, but...
These glass shoes aren't always reliable.
Come on, hurry.
Up the stairs, up the stairs!
Lucify, Lucify.
Up, up, up with it.
Here.
Why can't you hold still a minute?
My word. Enough of this!
The next young lady, please.
Did you hear that, Gus?
- Yup.
- Gotta hurry.
Come on, come on, hurry.
Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus, come on.
Look, look. Just up there. Come on.
Us is coming, Cinderelly.
- I can get you out.
- You've got the key!
How did you ever manage to...
Lucifer!
Let him go, Lucifer.
Please, let him go.
- Let him go.
- Let him go!
Let him go. Let him out, you hear?
Lucify, you...
Bruno. Yes, Bruno!
Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno!
Of all the stupid little idiots.
I'll do it myself.
Get away from me.
I'll make it fit.
- There.
- It fits.
It fits?
No!
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.
It shan't happen again.
Precisely, madam.
Come on, come on.
Get up, Gus-Gus, get up.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Let go, let go.
You are the only ladies in the household I hope... I presume.
- There's no one else, Your Grace.
- Quite so.
- Good day. Good day.
- Your Grace?
Your Grace, please, wait.
May I try it on?
- Pay no attention.
- It's Cinderella.
- From the kitchen.
- Ridiculous.
She's out of her mind.
Just an imaginative child.
Madam, my orders were "every maiden."
Come, my child.
Oh, no.
No, no, no. Oh, no!
Oh, this is terrible.
The King, what will he say?
What will he do?
Perhaps, if it would help...
No, no. Nothing can help now. Nothing.
But, you see, I have the other slipper.
Have faith in dreams
And someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish
Will come true
{847}{953}that our future|is altered forever.
{954}{1031}Fire. Electricity.
{1032}{1102}Splitting the atom.
{1103}{1238}At the dawn of the 31st century,|we unlocked another.
{1239}{1359}It had the potential to change|humanity's role in the universe.
{1360}{1437}We called it the Titan project,|and it was a testament...
{1438}{1513}to the limitless power|of the human imagination.
{1514}{1587}Perhaps that is what|the Drej feared most,
{1588}{1712}for it brought them down|upon us without warning...
{1713}{1782}and without mercy.
{1783}{1899}Cale, that day, the day|the Drej descended from the sky,
{1900}{2068}the only thing that mattered|was keeping you safe.
{2195}{2262}Perfect!

{2783}{2853}I'm okay.
{2854}{2945}Dad,|my invention broke.
{2946}{3171}Well, then, we'll fix it together,|but not today, Cale. We have to go now.
{3451}{3513}Dad, where's|everybody going?
{3514}{3625}We're leaving too.|We all have to go somewhere safe.
{3626}{3766}Professor Tucker! The Drej|have reached the global defense system!
{3767}{3862}Come on, son.|Will we get the people away in time?
{3863}{3944}- Not if we sit here talking, sir.|- I wanna drive.
{3945}{4006}- When you're older, kid.|- I'm older than four.

{4159}{4219}Whoa!
{4242}{4339}- Please|proceed to your designated-|- Is the Titan prepped?
{4340}{4428}-Just waiting for you, sir!|- Intelligence says the Drej|don't know the Titan's location,
{4429}{4471}or we would've|been hit already.
{4472}{4580}Let's pray|they're right!
{4616}{4701}Enemy warships|have entered our solar system.
{4702}{4789}Are we going in that?
{4790}{4845}- Wow!|- Cale,
{4846}{4925}I have to go|on a different ship.
{4926}{4994}- I have to go away for a while.
{4995}{5053}No, Dad! No!
{5054}{5154}- Tek is going to look after you.|- But I wanna go with you!
{5155}{5231}- Sir... - I know.|It's not safe where I'm going.
{5232}{5312}-Sir! Professor!|- I'm coming!
{5313}{5453}Cale, here. Take this.|As long as you wear it, there's hope.
{5454}{5595}- I will see you again. I promise.|- Okay.
{5596}{5708}- Cale, it's time. Cale...|- No, it's not okay! It's not okay!

{18345}{18466}- All right. Maybe I do.|- What a shock.
{18467}{18573}I want you to risk your life.|I want you to give up everything|you have to join the mission,
{18574}{18677}where you'll face terror and torture|and possibly gruesome death.
{18678}{18753}And I would|wanna do that because?
{18754}{18873}Because it's worth it.|Because the human race needs you.
{18874}{18981}Maybe you haven't|had a look around lately, but|there aren't many of us left.
{18982}{19059}At the rate we're going, they'll be|reading about us in textbooks...
{19060}{19163}- and displaying our bones|in alien museums.
{19164}{19287}- Yeah, well, having your planet|blown up can have that effect.
{19288}{19415}But maybe I've been wrong all|these years, and it took your|inspiring speech to make me see.
{19416}{19505}You've really changed me.|It's beautiful.
{19506}{19554}I think|we've gotta hug.
{19555}{19672}- Oh, man.|They've really ground you down.|- Hey, get this straight.
{19673}{19742}I don't even know you.|I don't want any part of your mission,
{19743}{19983}- and I don't need your help|with these oversized morons.{24875}{24948}Oh, okay.
{20007}{20089}- I think he called you morons.
{20090}{20164}- Whoa!|- Korso.
{20165}{20265}Captain, this is Akima.|We are not alone.
{20266}{20334}Are we in good company?
{20335}{20393}That's a negative,|Captain.
{20394}{20533}I think we've fallen in|with a very bad crowd.
{20534}{20671}Roger that.|Let's prep for departure.
{20688}{20773}Tek, I need to be scarce|for a while.
{20774}{20824}- You don't know the half of it.|- Ha-ha.
{20825}{20937}Are you still bothering people?|Hey, go away.
{20938}{21038}Great job with the kid, Tek.|He's a charmer.
{21039}{21116}I expected you to take him|off my hands a lot sooner.
{21117}{21165}- Tek, wait.|Who is this? You know him?|-Joseph Korso.
{21166}{21200}- Tek, wait.|Who is this? You know him?|-Joseph Korso.
{21201}{21301}- I was with your father|on the Titan project.|- My father.
{21302}{21397}- I don't have a father.|You brought this guy here?
{21398}{21481}- Yes.|- I don't understand. Why?
{21482}{21544}You still got that ring|your father gave you?
{21545}{21596}- Give it to me.|- Hey, give it back!
{21597}{21679}- Cale-|- Shh.
{21693}{21755}- Ahh.
{21776}{21839}Ah. Here.
{21840}{21934}- Put it on.|- Hmm.
{22034}{22118}- How did- How did you-|- It's a storage device.
{22119}{22213}It's genetically encrypted to your|father, and therefore, to you.
{22214}{22265}It's a map, Cale.
{22266}{22359}It can tell us|where your father hid the Titan.
{22360}{22480}That's why I've spent|the last 15 years lookin' for ya.
{22481}{22601}That ship means everything.|Humanity depends on you finding it.
{22602}{22664}Me?|Whoa, whoa, whoa.
{22665}{22750}Me? No, no, no.|I'm not- Tek, listen,
{22751}{22816}there must|be someone better.
{22817}{22902}It's time, Cale.|It's time to stop running.
{22903}{22981}- Well, actually,
{22982}{23095}I think it's time|to start.
{23119}{23186}Drej.|What do they want?
{23187}{23292}They want you, kid.|Same way I want you, only dead.
{23293}{23422}How do you know|they want me dead?
{23629}{23704}I'm convinced.
{23705}{23795}We gotta get|to the kitchen.
{23796}{23909}- Korso, the gravity drive!
{24024}{24086}- You ready?|- Tek, I'll lead you in.
{24087}{24181}- I'll stay here.|- Tek, you can't.
{24182}{24244}Take care of the kid.|He's not all grown up yet.
{24245}{24342}- No, no, no, no. You're coming.|- Go, Cale. I'll read about you.
{24343}{24415}Follow me!
{24450}{24510}Whoa!
{24520}{24637}- Well, this would be good|if we had any baking to do.
{24638}{24717}Oh, my food!|You guys are- You're terrible.
{24718}{24806}You're unsanitary.|Ooh, I hope that they catch you,
{24807}{24874}and I'll test if ya gainst you,|and you'll never get out of jail.
{24875}{24988}- Hey, you'll get|all the ketchup you want.
{24989}{25065}- Drej! Ooh, I gotta go now.|- Follow ugly!
{25066}{25147}Oh, great. Yeah, no one would ever|think of looking for us in the vent.
{25148}{25203}Go!
{25252}{25322}- Go! Go!
{25381}{25509}He's the big- I'm not supposed to be here!|Come on! I'm just a cook!
{25510}{25606}How do I get out of here? How do I get|out? Why is this happening tome?
{25607}{25707}Stupid- Please- Stupid- No!
{25708}{25778}Hi. They went right down there.|They came into my kitchen and-
{25779}{25853}Bull's-eye.
{25993}{26090}We gotta|get outta here.
{26091}{26146}Go!
{26162}{26229}Go! Run!
{26576}{26622}- Over.|- Huh?
{26623}{26692}- Maybe next time, kid.|- Hey, I can fly it too.
{26693}{26782}- It won't start.
{26786}{26868}I got an idea.
{26923}{27021}Give it a shot.|Whoa!
{27191}{27246}Ow!
{27257}{27370}- Hang on, kid. I'm comin'.
{27652}{27722}Heads up!
{27728}{27802}They're|locking down the doors!
{27803}{27937}- Not going forward. Going up.|- Up?
{27968}{28035}Move it!
{28396}{28583}- You should brace yourself.|- Uh, yeah. I'm feeling that.
{28654}{28734}Eject. Hey, where's the eject?|Cale? Cale?
{28735}{28864}This model does|have eject, right?
{28981}{29076}And you were worried.
{29077}{29137}What do you mean, "were"?
{29138}{29261}- Akima, we need a pickup.|- A little late for that.
{29262}{29354}- I'm right|above you. Can you get to me?|- Not enough time.
{29355}{29449}Not-Not-|Not a lot of time.
{29450}{29514}- Exhale.|- You gotta be kidding.
{29515}{29637}- Exhale.|- Oh, no, no, no, no!
{30541}{30607}* Comeback down to Earth, oh, yeah*
{30608}{30731}* Comeback down to Earth|Comeback down to Earth*
{30732}{30807}* Oh, yeah|Comeback down to Earth**
{30808}{30878}- Is it dead? Can we eat it?
{30879}{30955}No, it's not dead.
{30956}{31039}Who are you?|Go away.
{31040}{31129}- Hey, what's going on?|- Preed, you're in my light.
{31130}{31211}Ah, such motherly concern|for the subject.
{31212}{31334}- Why am I naked?|- Why, you positively glow|with maternal warmth, Akima.
{31335}{31400}It's very fetching.|I must have you.
{31401}{31496}- In your dreams.|- Akrennians don't dream, remember?
{31497}{31561}- They don't bathe much, either.|- I'm still naked here.
{31562}{31671}I hadn't noticed. Now, hold still, or|you'll lose something really important.
{31672}{31781}- Hand me the probe.|- The probe? Uh,|-where does the probe go?
{31782}{31892}You know, I'm really feeling|much better. Aah! Hey!
{31893}{31953}This is just great.|Cross half the galaxy,
{31954}{32024}nearly get our butts|shot off by the Drej,
{32025}{32090}just so we can|rescue the window washer.
{32091}{32183}Hey, for your information, I happen|to be humanity's last great hope.
{32184}{32264}- I weep for the species.|- You're fine.
{32265}{32358}I mean, I'm the guy with the map here.|This is big medicine, right?
{32359}{32448}Big medicine? Let me see.
{32449}{32533}This is really it?|This can save us?
{32534}{32628}Huh? Yeah, I guess.
{32692}{32783}- Do you know what this means?
{32784}{32867}Um, I'm really wanting those pants|right about now.
{32868}{32933}Akima, my pet, if the boy isn't|at death's door,
{32934}{33008}Korso wants Gune to check the map|so we can set a course.
{33009}{33072}Do you mind?|Are we through pawing?
{33073}{33168}- This is the Valkyrie,|not a singles bar.|- We're done.
{33169}{33311}You know,|I never said I was gonna help you guys.|We never addressed what's in it for me.
{33312}{33378}- Why, you get to be a hero.|- A hero? Come on.
{33379}{33476}I mean, there must be something on the|Titan worth selling or trading or-
{33477}{33588}What? We're gonna risk our necks|to help a bunch of Drifter Colony bums?
{33589}{33687}- Where are my pants?
{33699}{33788}- Guess where Akima grew up.|- Drifter Colony?
{33789}{33927}- Yes. The boy learns.|- Wait. What's your-
{33928}{34052}Preed, wait up! Look.|Where's Korso? I wanna talk to him.
{34053}{34225}I believe he's in Navigation.|We're headed there now.
{34226}{34307}- You wanna watch|who you're steppin' on.
{34308}{34365}Or you'll what?
{34366}{34478}- Ah, the lovely and talented Stith.|This is Cale.
{34479}{34552}- You remember- Cale.|- No, no, no, no, no. Cannot talk.
{34553}{34637}We lost targeting on one|of our aft gun turrets again!
{34638}{34696}What? Think|this is a pleasure cruise?
{34697}{34822}She's a sweet little thing.|Weapons specialist.|Normally, she's very good-natured.
{34823}{34932}Great!|Things aren't bad enough!
{34933}{35019}- Tools all over the floor!|- Fight the good fight, precious.
{35020}{35117}Preed, I'll kill you. Okay?|I will kill you.
{35118}{35211}I am educated and well-read!|lam not mechanic!
{35212}{35321}- I have my pride! - Gune?|Guney? Are you in there?
{35322}{35403}...by the acceleration, multiplied|by the coefficient of the friction...
{35404}{35453}and apply necessary force.
{35454}{35526}- Gune?|- Ooh.
{35527}{35602}- Look at that.|- Does this look familiar?|Do you know what it is?
{35603}{35770}- Neither do I. I made it|last night in my sleep.{44688}{44788}Apparently, I used Gindrogac-|highly unstable.
{35771}{35849}- Gune.|- I put a button on it, yes.
{35850}{35952}I wish to press it, but I'm not sure|what will happen if I do.
{35953}{36073}- Let me see, now. Three, five,|twenty-two, seventy-four,
{36074}{36121}- eleven-
{36122}{36183}- No. Careful.
{36184}{36294}- It's perfect.|- Ho, yes!
{36306}{36374}- Hey.|- Perfect! You fixed it!
{36375}{36449}- So, where are we now?
{36450}{36546}We are here, right here-|Bellasan Quadrant.
{36547}{36691}About three million keks from Tau 14.|Why? Are you homesick?
{36692}{36779}- Gotta have a home for that.|- Mmm.
{36780}{36868}Translucent bipedal|mesomorphic embryonic male.
{36869}{36965}Yes, yes, yes. This is all very|fascinating, but take a look at this.
{36966}{37052}- It's a map. Can you read it?|- Can I read it?
{37053}{37122}Of course I can read it.|Yes. Hmm.
{37123}{37183}- So, what do you see?|- Ah!
{37184}{37276}- Yes, this is Pl'ochda.
{37277}{37381}- And this- this-|this is... Solbrecht!
{37382}{37453}And this- And this-|And this- What is this?
{37454}{37541}- That's, uh- That's lunch.|- What's lunch?
{37542}{37604}- Mmm.
{37611}{37733}Spaghetti derivative, meatballs- sort|of, anyway- and Caldoch droppings.
{37734}{37837}- Who ate it before you did?|- Hey, hey!
{37838}{37892}Ahh!
{37893}{37979}- Tell you a secret. This guy's nuts.|- Tell you another.
{37980}{38058}He's never wrong.|Where are we going, Gune?
{38059}{38174}Ahh, the broken moon|of Sesharrim.
{38175}{38224}Only 13.000 keks away.
{38225}{38390}- Have Akima lay in a course.|- We're on our way.
{38584}{38683}- What's on Sesharrim, anyway?|- The Gauol, an ancient race.
{38684}{38749}- Great.|- This isn't a joy ride, kid.
{38750}{38851}When the Drej destroyed Earth,|they figured life adrift in space...
{38852}{38939}would break us down,|wipe us out.
{38940}{39100}Do you really want|those vile creatures to be right?
{39101}{39209}-Just lay down and die?|- A little late.
{39210}{39333}About 15 years too late|to save the humans. But it's not|like we didn't have a good run.
{39334}{39424}It's not about a good run.|It's about our survival.
{39425}{39536}See, the Titan was truly visionary,|the most advanced ship in the universe.
{39537}{39664}That ship has the power to reunite|the human race, to give us a home.
{39665}{39754}And the only way to find it|is in your hand.
{39755}{39841}So, you're really|counting on me, then?
{39842}{39922}- We all are.|- Well,
{39923}{39998}if I don't like|the way things are going,
{39999}{40139}I'll show you how much|like my father I really am.
{40140}{40214}I'll leave.
{40568}{40634}Ahh, no place to|set down on the island.
{40635}{40740}Land on that coral reef.
{40901}{40981}We'll take the sled,|see if we can locate the Gauol.
{40982}{41071}- Preed, you and Gune watch the ship.|- Watch the ship?
{41072}{41153}- And keep the engines hot.|- Oh, yes. They'll be nice and toasty.
{41154}{41281}- Hmm.|- I'm not keen on the Drej catching me|with my trousers down.
{41282}{41356}Welcome to Planet Sesharrim, Cale.
{41357}{41428}- It stinks.|- Hydrogen trees.
{41429}{41543}Clip one of those,|and we'll be blown to steaming bits.
{41544}{41635}Hello? Anybody here?
{41636}{41691}We're looking|for the Gauol.
{41692}{41766}Now, what exactly|do the Gauol look like?
{41767}{41838}Don't know.|They don't get out much.
{41839}{42036}We have a kid with a map here|that you guys should know about.
{42424}{42533}I think we know|what happened to the Gauol.
{42534}{42603}Open fire on five.
{42604}{42710}- We'll clear a path to the sled.|Everybody ready?
{42711}{42785}- One, two-
{42793}{42876}Wait. No, no.|Stop.
{42877}{42994}- I think they are the Gauol.
{43091}{43149}Ahh.
{43238}{43299}Oh, yeah!
{43300}{43352}Quick little devil.
{43353}{43417}-**- Okay, all I have to do is tap|into the central computer,
{43418}{43469}and we can figure|the departure protocols.
{43470}{43563}- Yes. Making progress.|Yes, I'm making progress.
{43564}{43625}Huh? Wait, wait.
{43626}{43686}- Hmm.
{43687}{43757}Ooh. Hmm.
{44294}{44429}The moon, the moon, the moon. Right,|yeah. That's how we knew to come here.
{44430}{44519}My father made a map|with that moon on it.
{44520}{44640}Why? Is the ship|hidden there?
{44676}{44734}Ohh.
{44794}{44854}- Oh.
{45078}{45148}Hmm. Ahh.
{45237}{45324}It must be somewhere|in the Andali Nebula.
{45325}{45409}We did it, kid.
{45430}{45506}The Titan is as good|as ours.
{45507}{45598}He must have been here, standing here.|Right here.
{45599}{45693}- Who?|- My father.
{45784}{45839}Go!
{45911}{45993}Let's move it!
{46000}{46117}We've gotta|get to the beach!
{46821}{46888}- Akima!
{47297}{47375}- Why aren't they shooting at Cale?|- They want him alive.
{47376}{47515}Come on, guys.|Pick it up. Pick it up.
{47822}{47896}Nice catch.
{48115}{48204}Pull up! Pull up!
{48880}{48943}Preed, come in!|Preed, where are you?
{48944}{49016}- Hold on!
{49042}{49125}-Preed, come in!
{49126}{49191}-Preed!
{49279}{49395}Preed, Preed, Preed! Aren't you|supposed to be watching for the Drej?
{49396}{49493}Yes, caveman, that's right.|Drej bad. We good.
{49494}{49571}- Now, go look at|something shiny for a while.
{49572}{49634}- How's this?
{49635}{49757}- Well, you'd better look again!
{49758}{49805}Drej!
{49806}{49868}- Aah!
{50376}{50435}Captain, we're on our way.|Where are you?
{50436}{50499}We're in the|hydrogen trees being chased by the Drej.
{50500}{50647}-See if you can spot them, quick!|- Look there!
{50648}{50742}- Akima!|- Hang on!
{50911}{50983}Nice move.
{51063}{51133}Get down!
{51252}{51360}Come on.|Show yourselves.
{51378}{51458}- Get down!|- Cale!
{51459}{51536}- I got 'em.
{51580}{51640}Whoa!
{51644}{51752}Preed, look!|There they are!
{51753}{51818}Oh, no.
{51877}{51966}- Hang on, Akima!
{52016}{52091}Don't shoot!
{52092}{52212}Don't shoot!|They've got Cale!
{52287}{52361}Gune, calculate their trajectory.|Stith, take weapons.
{52362}{52432}- Let's get on it, people.|- Nice job covering our butts, Preed.
{52433}{52514}- You're the weapons expert.|- What were you doing? Taking a nap?
{52515}{52603}Enough! Okay,|the Drej took Cale.
{52604}{52672}But they are not|gonna get away with it.
{52673}{52750}Well, let's quit running|our collective mouths and go get him.
{52751}{52960}Our only chance to locate them|is to track Akima. Stith, get on it.
{52999}{53046}Hmm.
{53047}{53159}They're gonna use you to figure out|where the Titan is.
{53160}{53249}Probably just blow it up,|too, when they find it.
{53250}{53368}- Yeah, well, who's to say|it would've worked, anyway?|- Who's to say it won't?
{53369}{53475}Maybe Korso will get|to the Titan first.
{53476}{53573}Why do you care so much|about that thing?
{53574}{53639}I was raised|around people.
{53640}{53778}" Drifter Colony bums,"|I believe, is the term.
{53779}{53896}I barely remember Earth, but the older|ones used to tell us about it...
{53897}{53971}so it would never|be completely lost.
{53972}{54065}No matter how hard things got-|and they were hard-
{54066}{54141}those memories|kept us going.
{54142}{54238}Once, we had a home.
{54258}{54406}The Titan is our chance|to find one again.
{54407}{54497}I guess that's how|I ended up here.
{54498}{54602}What are they afraid of? So what did|the human race ever do to the Drej?
{54603}{54703}- It's not what we did. They're afraid|of what we might become.|- Hmm.
{54704}{54862}Yeah, well, looks like|we're becoming extinct.
{55921}{56010}- Cale, you okay?
{56015}{56082}- Akima!
{56197}{56257}Cale!
{57609}{57703}- Cale!|- No! Stop!
{57802}{57888}Leave her alone!
{57931}{57993}Akima!
{58010}{58065}No!
{58720}{58881}Akima's signal is|getting stronger. I think it's|coming from the slave cages.
{58882}{58955}-A Drej pod. What's in it?|- A human.
{58956}{59017}- She's mine. I saw her first.
{59018}{59088}- Pretty.
{59148}{59210}Ah. All right.
{59211}{59346}- I'll take out the guard.|- Easy, big girl.|This requires cunning and deception.
{59347}{59404}- Hello.|- Ah.
{59405}{59479}Uh, I'm an Akrennian trader.
{59480}{59585}I wonder if we might sneak|a peek at the new shipment|before they go on the market.
{59586}{59675}- You're not allowed.|- Traditionally, no.|You're absolutely right.
{59676}{59762}But you see,|I need a new slave rather badly.
{59763}{59838}- Stop fidgeting, worm!
{59839}{59924}And I can't wait till auction.|I have to be on the shuttle.
{59925}{60020}I have an appointment|to have my ear shaved.|It has to be booked months in advance.
{60021}{60115}- You see my problem.|- Hmm.
{60116}{60190}You're lying. He's not a slave,|and you're not traders.
{60191}{60240}- But-|- He doesn't carry himself|like a slave.
{60241}{60312}- Look at the way he stands.|Probably ex-military.|- How-
{60313}{60376}Akrennian traders always threaten before|they ask a favor. It's tradition.
{60377}{60451}- And your robes are made|out of bedspreads.
{60452}{60629}- Ah. -Just out of curiosity,|did we have a plan " B"?
{60789}{60971}- Hmm. An intelligent guard.|Didn't see that one coming.
{61400}{61458}Hmm.
{61700}{61758}Hmm.
{61916}{61976}Whoa.
{63040}{63119}- This is it.
{63157}{63251}- Are you in there?
{63285}{63441}Well, if it isn't the captain.|What kept you?
{65364}{65481}Do you see anything? It was really|small, like a cocoon or something.
{65482}{65545}No, no, no.|Nothing like that. No. Mmm.
{65546}{65614}I do see something.
{65615}{65690}Oh, no. Just a Drej ship.|Drej!
{65691}{65759}- What? Where?|- I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it.
{65760}{65831}- Korso, we have a problem.|You'd better get up here.
{65832}{65902}- I'm here. I'm here.|What's the problem?
{65903}{65974}- Stith, let's go.|- All right. All right.
{65975}{66042}- I've locked on to him, sir.|- Gune, look out for his buddy.
{66043}{66138}- There's only one.|He's all alone. Just one.|- Three, five, twenty-two-
{66139}{66219}- Three, five, twenty-two,|seventy-four, eleven.
{66220}{66322}- Cale!|- Die, Drej scum ball!
{66323}{66374}Oh, don't-|No, don't shoot. Oh, guys-
{66375}{66425}- Come on. It's me!|- It's Cale!
{66426}{66539}- Cale!|- Stith, hold your fire!
{66540}{66589}- Oops.
{66590}{66700}Akima,|open the cargo bay.
{66930}{66990}Cale!
{67059}{67174}- Ah! The boy is not dead.|This is cause for happiness.|- Hmm.
{67175}{67262}So, um- how did you escape?
{67263}{67355}- He got lucky.|- You know, we were just|about to rescue you.
{67356}{67426}- Yeah? Well, thanks.
{67427}{67536}- Anytime.|- Look, uh, they copied the map.
{67537}{67618}- I'm sure they're heading|for the Titan now.
{67619}{67730}They won't find it.|Stations, people.
{67731}{67822}Yes. Going, going.
{67843}{67898}Akima?
{67899}{67998}Uh, um, what happened?|How'd you get back?
{67999}{68084}I got picked up with the trash.|Luckily, Korso got there...
{68085}{68244}before I ended up as a door prize|in some alien freak show.
{68245}{68321}I guess I owe him one.
{68322}{68432}You know, we both|got real lucky back there.
{68433}{68513}- But next time around-|-Cale.
{68514}{68625}Come on.|Gune needs a hand.
{68626}{68708}- Yes, the map is good.|The map is different.
{68709}{68775}- Yes, the map is clear.
{68776}{68876}- Yes, it's very, very clear.|- Ooh. Take it easy.
{68877}{68963}Hmm. This outer marking|is pulsing.
{68964}{69095}- Ah, the distal Phalangial Meridian.|- Gune, what do you make of it?
{69096}{69191}Past outer quadrant.
{69192}{69333}This is the Ice Rings of Tigrin.|Right here. Hmm.
{69334}{69499}- Easy to get lost in there.|- Good hiding place.
{69919}{69979}What?
{69988}{70070}- Wake angels.
{70100}{70215}They follow ships into deep space,|glide on the energy wake.
{70216}{70330}- They're supposed to be good luck.
{70331}{70391}They're like ghosts.
{70392}{70462}Sit down. Why don't|you give 'em a run?
{70463}{70560}- You sure about that?|- 'Course I'm sure.
{70561}{70619}Okay.
{70620}{70698}*It's my time to fly*
{70699}{70775}*I'm proving ground|tonight*
{70776}{70895}*I'll try to be the best|that I can*
{70896}{70971}Yeah. You got it.|Open her up.

{71078}{71159}Try this, guys.

{73148}{73237}- Thank you.|- I knew you could handle this old bird.
{73238}{73302}No, I mean,|thank you for-
{73303}{73403}Thank you for trying to find me.|It's more than my father ever did.
{73404}{73495}Your father was a great man,|Cale.
{73496}{73584}- He would've been proud of ya.
{73585}{73714}- You really think so?|- Trust me.
{73717}{73801}Thanks. Thanks.
{73872}{73977}You know, I-|I miss him.
{74056}{74121}Me too.
{75434}{75489}Akima?
{75490}{75610}Akima? Huh?|Oh, uh, uh, sorry.
{75627}{75749}- In or out?|- Huh? Oh, uh, in.
{75847}{75967}Uh, what's going on?|Do you know why we stopped?
{75968}{76047}Pit stop for the basics.|Drifter Colony's the best place...
{76048}{76181}to pick up plasma packs,|fuel cells, frozen burritos.
{76182}{76274}Listen. I need|to talk to you, and-
{76275}{76351}Where'd you get all this junk?
{76352}{76422}Not junk.
{76444}{76593}Why don't you come with me?|I'll show you.
{76683}{76773}So, we're gonna barter this stuff|for more of that Earth junk?
{76774}{76930}Don't you get it, Cale?|That junk is all that's left|of the place we came from.
{76931}{77006}It reminds us of|all the things we miss.
{77007}{77103}Mm, miss. Like those frozen burritos|you were talking about.
{77104}{77172}- At least they don't|jump off your plate.
{77173}{77240}You think this is some game?|Did you forget the plan?
{77241}{77359}I get you the Titan;|I get rich. We had a deal, right?
{77360}{77511}- How dare you try|to cut me out like that?
{77518}{77638}Yeah? Do as you please, and|guess what. You'll retrieve nothing.
{77639}{77745}You don't have the whole map.|The kid's got it. And I've got the kid.
{77746}{77808}So you keep your drones|off my back,
{77809}{77904}or so help me,|I'll rip his heart out.
{77905}{77960}Cale, come on.
{77961}{78047}Going somewhere?
{78052}{78177}two little birdies itchy to fly.
{78181}{78273}- How long were they standing there?|- Long enough.
{78274}{78327}You lied?
{78328}{78405}Everything you said?|Everything you told me?
{78406}{78485}Not everything.|Your father hid his ship,
{78486}{78573}then the Drej killed him,|all because he couldn't face the truth.
{78574}{78716}- Yeah? What is the truth?|- That the human race is out of|gas. It's circling' the drain.
{78717}{78810}It's finished.|The only thing that matters|is grabbin' what you can...
{78811}{78871}before somebody else|beats you to it.
{78872}{78927}No, I don't believe that!
{78928}{79097}Then you're even more like|your father than I thought. A fool.
{79098}{79192}- Cale!|- Uh-uh-uh.
{79279}{79399}- Akima, come on!|- Stop them.
{79466}{79588}Stay on 'em.|I'll lock it down.
{79638}{79729}- Hurry!|- Go! Go!
{79888}{79972}- Akima! Akima?
{80381}{80485}Let's go.|We got a ship to find.
{80486}{80534}Let's get airborne,|now.
{80535}{80594}- Where's Cale and Akima?|- They're not coming.
{80595}{80645}- Why not?|- Because they're afraid.
{80646}{80732}Afraid? What exactly are they afraid of?
{80733}{80852}They're|afraid of what might happen|if my command was ever questioned.
{80853}{80900}- Get it?
{80901}{80958}- Got it.|- Got a problem with that?
{80959}{81014}No.
{81089}{81223}- Why they not say good-bye to Gune?
{81485}{81578}- Go get a blanket, quickly.|She needs warmth.|- Something to keep her warm.
{81579}{81626}You, go get a doctor.
{81627}{81673}- Yeah. Hurry.|- Cover her.
{81674}{81725}- Yes, yes.|- What did you tell him?
{81726}{81780}I asked him|to bring corn liquor.
{81781}{81837}No. Really,|I don't need it.
{81838}{81897}Ha! Not for you.|For boy.
{81898}{81949}- Me?|- He pass out soon.
{81950}{82067}- She'll be fine. She just|needs rest. Don't worry.
{82068}{82152}She'll be fine.
{82318}{82376}Hey!
{82511}{82608}It's his favorite thing in the world-
{82609}{82661}that stupid ball.
{82662}{82720}It was our dad's|back on Earth.
{82721}{82768}Every time|he kicks that thing,
{82769}{82833}my brother thinks|he's in a big grass field.
{82834}{82897}That's some imagination.
{82898}{83083}Yeah, well- There. He had|a little help. See what I mean?
{83106}{83153}That's him- our dad.
{83154}{83213}That's where my brother|got the idea.
{83214}{83269}Hmm.
{83270}{83332}Here on the colony,|most people got to shut their eyes...
{83333}{83422}to see anything other|than rusted spaceship hulls.
{83423}{83507}Not my brother.
{83520}{83582}Later.
{83838}{83885}Ahem.
{83886}{83981}- Hey. Sleeping Beauty.|- How long was I out?
{83982}{84052}Not long.|A few hours.
{84053}{84154}Korso and Preed. I can't believe it.
{84155}{84225}How long before|they reach the Titan?
{84226}{84331}They won't.|We're gonna beat them to it.
{84332}{84407}Akima, we're gonna|stop them.
{84408}{84516}Was I seriously injured|back there or something,
{84517}{84598}'cause, funny, I thought you just said|we're gonna stop them?
{84599}{84666}- That's right.|- Cale, we're in the middle of nowhere.
{84667}{84713}- That's right.|- Cale, we're in the middle of nowhere.
{84714}{84821}There's just the two of us,|and, oh, yeah- We don't have a ship.
{84822}{84888}- Oh, we've got a ship.|- Really?
{84889}{84949}- Mm-hmm.|- I'd like to see this ship.
{84950}{85009}Check it out.
{85010}{85106}- Oh, no.|- Oh, yes.
{85225}{85404}Well, she's been a great house,|but I don't think she'll fly.
{85405}{85492}Well, she's still got her ionic|vacuum drive. Those never drain.
{85493}{85572}- This thing's a wreck.|- I can fix it, but do you think-
{85573}{85630}Don't worry.|I can fly it.
{85631}{85729}Good, 'cause|we launch yesterday.
{85730}{85793}*I've gotta getaway from here*
{85794}{85882}*It couldn't be too soon*
{85883}{85977}* 'Cause I've seen the stars|for you and me*
{85978}{86088}*Like rockets|to the moon*
{86092}{86200}* You take me everywhere|that I've never been*
{86201}{86340}*Show me the meaning|of what life had to give*
{86341}{86409}*I don't know|what to say*
{86410}{86541}-*I think that maybe|I'm in over my head*
{86542}{86658}-*Stuck in the bed|Somethin' she said*|- Own!
{86659}{86784}-*Makes me think|that I'm in over my head*
{86785}{86841}* Over my head**
{86842}{86913}T-minus ten, nine,
{86914}{86985}eight, seven,
{86986}{87036}-six, five,|- Well, we're good to go.
{87037}{87118}- Let's hope she starts.|- four, three,
{87119}{87165}- two,|- Oh, she'll start.
{87166}{87279}- one, zero.|- Yeah, right.
{87380}{87464}- She'll start.
{87471}{87528}Uh, I'd lean back|if I were you.
{87529}{87644}- Should I get out and push?
{87674}{87753}- Whoa!|- Ha.
{87888}{88070}- Told ya.|- Okay. You did your job.|Now let me do mine.
{88627}{88697}These collisions keep slowing us down.
{88698}{88825}- So where is it?|- My scanners are picking up|a cornucopia of nothing.
{88826}{88905}Just find it!|Gune, are you sure about that map?
{88906}{89024}You give me map. I follow map.|What more can Gune do?
{89025}{89128}- If Professor Screw loose led us|off course, I'm going to-|- Hold it!
{89129}{89182}- What is it?|-A ship. Three keks east.
{89183}{89268}- Drej?|- No. Human craft heading|for the break zone. Fast.
{89269}{89336}- How fast?|- I'd say recklessly fast.
{89337}{89424}- Akima.|- Ah, good!
{89425}{89490}Akima. Cale.|I hail on communicator.
{89491}{89539}No hailing.|Just follow them.
{89540}{89629}Okay. I follow, but I plot|new route through safer quadrant.
{89630}{89697}- If we-
{89710}{89769}- We're going to follow them,
{89770}{89868}and we'll run silent.
{90067}{90196}The reflections|are throwing my readings off.
{90197}{90341}Uh, Akima, I think|we're getting closer.
{90368}{90437}- Cale! It's Korso.|- Huh?
{90438}{90560}- He's right behind us.|- What?
{90607}{90708}We've got to lose him.
{90918}{91088}- We'll never find them in there.|- We're going in.
{91128}{91204}- Stith, where are they?|- I can't get a reading.
{91205}{91373}There's too much ice,|too much interference, Captain.
{91374}{91465}- Captain.|- Whoa!
{91813}{91878}- Whoa!
{92059}{92117}A heat signature.|I see them!
{92118}{92238}- Where are they?|- Behind us!
{92606}{92666}- No!
{92861}{92907}Where is he?
{92908}{92992}I-I don't know.
{93118}{93217}- What?|- Well, we found them, Captain.
{93218}{93277}No more heat readings.|All gone.
{93278}{93424}Until they make their move,|we stay here.
{93774}{93944}- They're moving out, I think.|- Now we've got 'em.
{94121}{94332}- I can't move. They'll see us.|- Maybe that's exactly what we want.
{94343}{94410}A reading!|Yeah. They're right in front of us.
{94411}{94481}You're not gonna|get past me, kid.
{94482}{94573}- There, Captain!|- That's right, Cale. Keep coming.
{94574}{94630}Closer.|They're getting closer!
{94631}{94732}There she is, Captain.
{94752}{94837}No. There, Captain.
{94838}{94910}Which one?
{95218}{95333}Look!|They're behind us now!
{95449}{95564}- Ready lasers!|- I'm on it!
{95599}{95738}I need one clear shot.|Don't lose 'em.
{96383}{96443}- Ice! Turn back!|- No way.
{96444}{96544}- We'll never make it through.|- We don't have a choice.
{96545}{96610}- Akima! Uh-|- Yes, Cale?
{96611}{96709}- Pull up!|- Shut up!
{96989}{97094}Let's not|do that again.
{97206}{97302}Hold it.|Look there.
{97434}{97559}Akima, turn around.|Turn around!
{98399}{98471}That's it.
{98547}{98693}Wow. Have you ever|seen anything like it?
{98697}{98757}Once.
{99189}{99318}- What are we looking for?|- This ship's gonna|help us save mankind.
{99319}{99422}- What exactly are we looking for?|- Not a clue.
{99423}{99493}DNA coding.
{99494}{99583}" Mammal.|Tursiops truncatus. "
{99584}{99638}The bottle-nosed dolphin.
{99639}{99771}These are animals-|or they will be.
{99776}{99887}" Leopard.|Papilio glaucus. "
{99888}{100014}Swallowtail butterfly.|It's all here.
{100015}{100120}- Cale?|- I'm over here!
{100158}{100237}Look at this.
{100332}{100390}Dad.
{100607}{100687}I could never have done anything|like this when I was your age.
{100688}{100808}- I wonder who you take after?
{101071}{101136}- Whoa!
{101346}{101404}Hey.
{101724}{101799}- The Titan. Quick.|- Ready to go, Captain.
{101800}{101875}You two stay here.|Preed and I can wrap this up.
{101876}{101981}- But- Here. Hold on to this|in case there's any trouble.
{101982}{102065}Hmm.|N-N-N-N-No.
{102066}{102125}Those two are|becoming a problem.
{102126}{102199}- We need to take care of it.
{102200}{102308}I'm one step|ahead of you.
{102309}{102424}- Watch the ship.|I always watch the ship.|- This doesn't feel right.
{102425}{102495}- I wanna go! I wanna go!|- Captain said stay.
{102496}{102566}It's Captain I don't trust.
{102567}{102649}Hmm. You know,|you may be right. Come on.
{102650}{102726}- Stith here.
{102727}{102813}- Stith,|is Gune right there with you?|- Yeah.
{102814}{102894}- Then please tell him good-bye|for me, won't you?|- What?
{102895}{102960}- Gune!
{102991}{103142}- I knew it! I knew|it! - Get out of there!
{103470}{103602}- Cale. If this message has-|- Dad?
{103614}{103690}If this message has been activated,|then I have died before finding you.
{103691}{103767}I hope|you can forgive me...
{103768}{103855}for breaking my promise|to see you again.
{103856}{103915}What I wouldn't give|to see you now.
{103916}{104059}I can't change the past, Cale,|but I hope I can give you a future.
{104060}{104172}This ship has the power|to create a planet,
{104173}{104250}to create a new home.
{104251}{104346}Your ring would have activated|the transformation sequence,
{104347}{104430}but the Titan's power cells|were drained in the escape.
{104431}{104551}- They are unable|to fuel the transformation.
{104552}{104617}It is up to you|to restore their power.
{104618}{104696}After that,|the procedure is simple.
{104697}{104817}- He always did talk too much.
{104828}{104917}- Oh!|- Ah-Ah-Ah.
{104938}{105038}Korso, don't do this.|This ship is all we have.|Doesn't that mean anything to you?
{105039}{105114}Sorry, kid.|World blowing up changes a man.
{105115}{105194}- Look. The Drej-|- See, you can't beat the Drej.
{105195}{105241}No one can.|They're pure energy.
{105242}{105341}Face it, Cale.|You've lost.
{105342}{105438}- Actually, you all have.
{105439}{105510}Captain, if you'll relieve yourself|of your fire arm-
{105511}{105608}- You backstabbing-|- Well, I learned from the best.
{105609}{105698}But it wasn't just the money|the Drej were offering.
{105699}{105762}It was the health plan|that came with it.
{105763}{105924}They'd let me live provided|I kill all of you before they get here.
{105925}{106040}They should be here shortly.
{106200}{106256}- Oh.|- Ah.
{106257}{106336}- Gune? Gune?
{106344}{106409}- Gune!
{106481}{106582}- Gune, are you all right?|- I'm- I'm all right f-for business.
{106583}{106683}- Gune.|- I'll just take a little nap...
{106684}{106794}since I'm so- very sleepy.
{106824}{106882}Ahh.
{106893}{106964}- Preed, you can't trust the Drej.|- Akima.
{106965}{107122}Oh, stop! There's nothing more|tiresome than last-minute heroics!
{107123}{107200}- Ooh!|- Ah!
{107460}{107551}- Captain? Mm. Oh.
{107567}{107634}Ah! Ahh.
{107650}{107734}- Hide 'n' seek, is it?|Or should we play...
{107735}{107782}search and destroy!
{107783}{107865}- Preed!|- Ah!
{108119}{108247}- Give me the ring.|- Aw. You're not gonna shoot me, kid.
{108248}{108306}Hmm.
{108348}{108444}- Hyah! Hyah!|- Ooh!
{108464}{108524}- Oh!
{108736}{108827}- Cale!|- Ah. Aah!
{108935}{109012}Hold on!|Oh!
{109025}{109104}You can let go, kid.|I wouldn't blame you.
{109105}{109213}No! I'm not|gonna let go!
{109278}{109345}- Korso!
{109423}{109512}- Cale! The Drej!
{109669}{109743}- You okay?
{109751}{109816}- Yeah.
{110153}{110245}- Let's not panic.|- We've gotta get out of here|before the Drej arrive.
{110246}{110340}- No, we're gonna stay right here.|- Right here is about to be blown apart.
{110341}{110403}- This could be a good thing. Wait.|- Come on, Cale!
{110404}{110504}Wait.|We can make this work.
{110505}{110583}- What did Korso say about the Drej?|- That you can't beat them.
{110584}{110656}Right!|Because they're pure energy.
{110657}{110827}If I can reroute the system to use Drej|energy, that would start the reactor.
{110828}{111012}The energy relays are linked to these|circuit breakers, so this should do it.
{111013}{111150}- Yes!|- Are you sure this will work?
{111181}{111234}Come on!|I can fix this!
{111235}{111328}I need to get outside.|Can you and Stith cover me?|I just need a little time.
{111329}{111400}- How much time?|- Uh, a few hours!
{111401}{111528}What can you do|in a few minutes?
{111765}{111911}- Here they come.|- Not if I can help it.
{112032}{112214}- Cale, you're|a sitting duck up there.|- I'm all right.
{112328}{112414}- Oh!|- Come on!
{112473}{112533}Whoo!
{112561}{112657}- Oh, fantastic.|I only have two guns left.|- Let's make 'em count.
{112658}{112809}- Akima, I can't shake 'em.|- I've got him.
{112947}{113024}Ah! I'm out!
{113048}{113144}Let's do this! Whoo!
{113228}{113410}- Well, guys, it's been fun.|- A little help here, Akima. Whoa!
{113411}{113476}- Cale!
{113497}{113588}I finished my nap!
{113643}{113734}- Gune!|- Who's your daddy?
{113735}{113826}Gune's your daddy!
{113841}{113916}Oh, no! No, no, no, no!
{113917}{113972}Oh!
{113993}{114093}- Cale, are you all right?|- I'm pinned.
{114094}{114164}- Stith, who's outside with Cale?
{114165}{114251}- Hi, kid.|- It's Korso!
{114252}{114393}You'll never get a cleaner shot, Korso.
{114451}{114516}- Whoa!
{114575}{114660}Maybe we can beat 'em|after all.
{114661}{114716}Uh-
{114724}{114786}Go ahead.|I'll cover you.
{114787}{114878}Yeah, yeah. Right.
{115207}{115267}Okay.
{115280}{115357}- Oh, great.
{115436}{115527}- Fry, Drej!|- Ah!
{115669}{115755}They're leaving.
{115802}{115907}Uh-oh.|We got a problem.
{115924}{116023}Ah. Go. They're|joining the mother ship.
{116024}{116090}- But the breaker!|- Cale, she's preparing to fire!
{116091}{116183}- You can't stay out here.|- I'll take care of it, so let's move.
{116184}{116254}Hey, hey!
{116260}{116335}Go on. Get out of here.
{116336}{116399}Cale, where are you?
{116400}{116465}Go. It's better this way.
{116466}{116521}Uh-
{116932}{117030}Here they come again.
{117262}{117367}Come on.|Faster. Faster.
{117398}{117487}Come on. Come on.
{118234}{118292}Ooh.
{118521}{118600}- Oh!|- Whoa!
{121718}{121804}This is amazing.
{121851}{121914}I know.
{121915}{121973}What are|you going to call it?
{121974}{122064}I think|I'll call it... Bob.
{122065}{122149}- Bob? - You don't like " Bob"?
{122150}{122200}You can't|call a planet " Bob."
{122201}{122285}Oh, so now you're the boss.|You're the king of Bob.
{122286}{122358}- Well, no, but-|- What?
{122359}{122406}Can't you just|call it Earth?
{122407}{122529}Well, no one said|you had to live on Bob.
{122530}{122593}I'm never...
{122594}{122680}calling it that.

Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city...
...eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing...
...and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time
I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies. No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo,
I'm smarter than the average bear!
All right!
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-I think it's probably--
-I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say
"bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did. Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know. Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure. Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay. That should do it. Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops. And....
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts,
Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine...
...you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
Yogi, are you out here?
-It's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence. I was never here.
Look-- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--? Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see. And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?! How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait! You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir. That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think...
...of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
Huh. It missed.
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
Ra-- Smith. You have a vis-- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry. Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay. I'll be in the Armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-Hello. I'm Rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure. I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry. My work isn't--
My brain isn't working right.
-I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea. Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read
The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-I like to-- Me too.
-Ha, ha! Yeah.
Ranger Smith. At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes. I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time...
...and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really? Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks? Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi? Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
I smell PB and J.
I'm all done.
Oh, right. That Yogi.
Bankrupt? No, no, no. We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes. Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes! Wow. Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay? Thank you.
Ugh. How did we ever go so broke?
-I think we just spent too much.
-Hmm. Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers...
...two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah. That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-If you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah. Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre...
...just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson...
...who's here to make a nature documentary.
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans. Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
-Huh?
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes. Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh. I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo. This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment. Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What? No. No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it,
Boo Boo.
-I was hooked.
-Really?
Yes. Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith! Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know
I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding. Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special. Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6. Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money...
...to cover its operating budget...
...can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
-I thought that went well.
-Yeah.
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget? Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish. Yeah. Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-I only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are. But this is one of the Iast places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today. But you know what?
-A lot can happen in a week.
-All right. Have it your way. Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh? Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
In a week! Do I have time for that?
-Impossible.
-Oh, shoot.
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course! I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer...
...dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds...
...and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry. We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
-Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow. How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir. Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-- I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles...
...so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles? Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish,
I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-Blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh. Oh, that. Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now. Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying,
"Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned? What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special. People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope. It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi. Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours...
...to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear...
...it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
On the other hand--
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir. Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far. I'll drive. Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know--
-I don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think
I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for llfe.
Try that with people...
...and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen. I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh--
If you want.
I mean, it's not that-- You don't-- It's--
You know, it's not a worry. Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes. I did. Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-Really? Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate,
I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid...
...and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds...
...swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything
I could about the park...
...so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to
Extreme Jellystone.
-I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi. Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament...
...and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi. That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep. But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in
With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right. We need something flashier than music. Not a problem.
I've got this water-skllng routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-I want to try it.
-I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski...
...or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park...
...you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay. Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees? That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 100, right?
-Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes. Exactly. Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes...
...the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right. Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant...
... but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary. There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 100th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-- No!
Oh, okay. Is it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-I got it, sir.
Yeah. That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
Yeah, ugh. It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park...
...which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah. Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says
I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues? Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-In a second. Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No. Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your llfe as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid llfe choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay? Here's my card.
So long.
Hey. Now why is it doing that?
No. Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms. Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms,
$10 off today. Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-I'm going.
Hey.
Wait. Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right. I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea. Unlock me.
Unlock me!
Okay. Here you go.
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning. I fear for your young ones.
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried. All Iast night
I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor. Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
Hey, guys. Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored? But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program...
...but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel,
I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so...
...gushy. Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
Oh, no.
I...
...saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love
And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
Hi. Hello...
...and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
Thank you. It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable...
...and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr. Mayor?
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
Hello, Jellystone!
No, don't encourage him!
They love me. I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo! Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skllng machine.
Ta-da!
Oh, wait. There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know. It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh? Fire!
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
-Nice one.
-Thanks.
Jump!
Let's go.
Out of my way!
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind. Let's go.
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different. You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive...
...while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my llfe.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi...
...how smart are you now?
Hey, there! That was quite a show you put on yesterday. Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park. Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor! Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it. You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does...
...and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole llfe, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if
I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm Ieaving, Boo Boo.
-I am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this. Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there. Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
Perfect.
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food. No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
-Come on.
-I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park. Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees. They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution...
... have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich...
...and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car. I hate it.
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is. Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing. You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference. No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah. Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger...
...is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and
Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there,
Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements
I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo. I'm busy foraging.
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo. You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
What are you doing? I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is...
... I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo...
...get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone,
Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called
Evergreen Park.
That's right. In the city.
The city? That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it. Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it. Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
Sorry.
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles? I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi. We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma. Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
Hey, move that shopping cart!
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want? I don't have a llfe left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends
I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One: light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love...
...whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try. Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do. Park is closed to the public until the press conference. Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone,
I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
-Mm-hm.
Oh, right. Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'll show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my. I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True. You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle. See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there. But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke. About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great. Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out. The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We’ll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No. A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is? Wow, I've never heard of that law...
... in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay. You know what? Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages...
...of having lived here since
I was a kid...
...is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh. Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight. My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-I don't know how to fly this thing.
-Well, you’ll pick it up as we go.
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-Flight systems check. Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-If I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi. Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
-All right.
-Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
Hold on, Boo Boo. Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
-Here we go!
-Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We’ll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We’ll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We’ll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let’s go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
-Hey!
-Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh. Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha. Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right. You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging? The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they’ll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha. Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that. He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit. Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
-I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go. Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
Look, Boo Boo! We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
-Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up. Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
Hey, told you. Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
-Welcome aboard.
-Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it. You saved him.
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on. Mr. Ranger said--
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
Who's that? I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
-Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
Yogi. Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
-Ranger Jones?
-I messed up pretty bad, sir.
-I know. It's okay.
-I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and
I value leadership. I have a merit badge--
Can we talk Iater?
We're pressed for time.
Yes. Get in.
Boo Boo! Boo Boo! Wait up!
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over. Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered
"frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-Rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-I'm sorry. He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you’ll excuse me,
I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah? Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them
Bigfoot is here. Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what? I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city...
...why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time. Must be something we can do. Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--? Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
He supports public safety.
All right, hurry up, people. Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
Hold on to that feeling
He's tough on crime.
Hey, hey, hey, look at this. Keep your eye on the little bear. Look at the skills.
Amazing!
And here's what Mayor Brown...
...proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered
"frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No. No.
No. I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
Okay. No. Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please. That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-All right!
-We got it! Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
Hey, we did it.
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
-Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are...
...and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay. All right, that's--
I'm good.
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general. I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle. And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
Huh?
Never mind.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hi. Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of...
...the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming...
...intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides...
...I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
I....
Let's-- Let's try that again.
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
Yogi!
I love this place.
Yogi! Hey! srt English Subtitles
Dan4Jem, ADMMXI
Here's my day, so far.
Went to jail, lost the girl of my dreams and got my butt kicked.
Pretty good.
Still, things could be a lot worse.
Oh, that's right, I'm falling to my death.
Guess they can't.
How did it all come to this, you ask?
My end starts at the beginning.
The very beginning.
Yes, that's me.
I had a fairly standard childhood.
I came from what you might call, a broken home.
Literally, broken.
I was eight days old and still living
How sad is that?
Clearly it was time to move on.
Here is your, Minion, he will take care of you.
And here is your binkie.
You are destined for ...
I didn't quite hear that last part.
But it sounded important.
Destined for, what?
I set out to find my destiny.
Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea.
That was the day I met,
Mr. Goody-two-shoes.
And our glorious rivalry, was born!
Could this be what I was destined for?
A dream life filled with luxury?
Apparently not.
Even fate makes its favorite soup.
No big deal.
A much different fate awaited me.
A baby.
How thoughtful.
Oh yes, yes. I saw it and thought of you.
Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home.
Can we keep him?
A place that taught me the differences between right...
...and wrong.
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand, had life handed to him on a silver platter.
Our baby can fly.
- Yes, yes
- And that was not the best
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.
But I had something far, far greater,
My amazing intellect.
A knack for building objects of mayhem.
After a few years, and with some time off for good behavior.
I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning.
At a strange place called shh-ool.
It was there that I once again ran into
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.
He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft-headed groupies.
He bought their affections with showmanship,
So I too would make this 'popped-corn' and win over those mindless dregs.
Lights out!
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.
Good receives all the praise, adulation.
While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner.
So a fitting end wasn't really an option.
While they were learning the itsy bitsy spider.
I learned how to dehydrate animate objects.
And rehydrate them at will.
Someday's it felt like it was just me and Minion,
No matter how hard I tried.
I was always the odd man out.
The last one picked.
The screw-up... black sheep.
Bad boy.
Oh!
Was this my destiny?
Wait! Maybe it was.
Being bad is the one thing
I'm good at.
Then it hit me.
If I was the bad boy.
Then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all.
I was destined to be a super villain.
And we were destined to be rivals.
The die had been cast.
And so began an enduring epic, life long career.
And I loved it.
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.
He would win some, I would almost win others.
He took the name, Metro Man.
Defender of Montrosity.
I decided to pick up something a little more humble.
Megamind.
Incredibly handsome criminal genius, and master of all villainy.
MEGAMIND
Read on your own time. Open up.
Hey!
BOO!
Oh, good morning, Warden.
Great news, I'm a changed man.
And I'm ready to re-enter society as a solid citizen.
You're a villain, and you're always be a villain.
You'll never change.
And you'll never leave.
- You're fun.
- You got a present in the mail.
Is it a puppy?
From Metro Man. To count every second of your 85 life sentences.
That's funny, never thought Metro Man was the gloating type.
Oh but he does have nice taste.
I think I'll keep it.
Any chance you could give me the time?
I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man museum.
Oh no, looks like you're
By several thousand years.
Oh, am I?
Happy Metro Man day, Metro City.
It's a beautiful day downtown where we're here to honor a beautiful man.
Metro Man.
His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean.
For years he's been watching us
Saving us with his super strength, and caring for us with his super heart.
Now it's our turn to give something back.
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live, from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.
Wow, okay, the stuff they make you read on the air.
That's unfreaking believable, it's crazy.
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.
What I was trying to say was,
I can't believe that in our modern society they let like actual art get onto the news.
- Nice save, Hal.
- What are we, like lets just get
Come on, it's time to get in the
Metro Man day spirit.
Well, if I were Metro Man Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.
That's the first thing.
That's sweet of you.
And I'd be watching you, like a dingo watches a human baby.
- Mmm.
- Okay, that sounded, Okay that
A little bit, yeah.
And you're making your face, and that's making me feel weird.
Not love, we're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.
Okay, I love you, whatever.
I'm not saying I'm in love with you.
I'm saying... Roxanne?
Roxaroo?
Get back to work.
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.
- Freeze!
- Whoa, what are you doing, guys?
It's ME!
Hey, open up.
Oh, you fools. He's tricked us.
You were right.
I'll always be a villain.
Bad to the bone.
Bad to the bone.
B..B..B..Bad.
B..B..B..Bad.
Bad to the bone.
Well hello good looking, need a lift?
Certainly do, you fantastic fish you.
Get in the car, you.
Thanks for sending me the watch, Minion.
You got it, boss.
All right, put your hands in the air.
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man.
And... Metro Men.
Hey, Metro City!
Give me some, come on give it now.
Give it to me. What?
Give it to me... all right!
Yo, hey, ha, ha yo.
Hey, Metro city.
Hello, hey.
You know, you actually want to bring it down a bit.
Boys, a little lower.
Thank you fellows.
Let's get real for a moment.
That's right, that's right ha, ha, that's right.
Although getting a whole museum is super cool.
Super cool, you want to know what the greatest honor you've given me is?
Do you really want to know?
Really?
Then I'll tell you.
The greatest honor you've given me is...
...letting me serve you.
To help these people of Metro city.
And at the end of every day.
Well.
I often ask myself.
Who would I be, without you?
I love you Metro Man!
And I love you, random citizen.
I tell you Minion, there's no place like evil lair.
I kept it cold and damp, just for you, sir.
How do I look, Minion?
- Do I look bad?
- Disgustingly horrifying, sir.
You always know what to say.
All the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.
Did you miss your daddy?
Whose the menacing little brains?
You are, yes you are. Uh, uh!
No biting, no, no, no.
- No, no, no. You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.
Now, back to work.
She's awake,
Quick, to work.
- Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
- Would it kill you to wash the bag?
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.
I'm afraid no one can hear you.
Wha..why isn't she screaming?
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind.
Like this... AHHHHH!
That's, that's a poor ladies scream.
AHHHHH!
Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website, where you get Tesla coils, and blinky dials?
Actually most of it comes from an outlet store in...
Don't answer that.
...Romania.
Don't! Stop! She's using her nosey reporter skills, on your weak little mind to find out all our secrets.
Such tricks... won't work... on me.
- Please talk slower
- Temptress.
What secrets? You're so predictable.
Predictable, predictable?
Oh, you call THIS predictable?
Your Alligators, yes.
I was thinking about it on the way over.
What's this? BOOM!
- In your face.
- Cliché.
No, look, watch.
Juvenile.
- Shuck it all!
- Tacky
- Oh, so sorry.
- Seen it.
- What's this one do?
- Garish.
Okay, the spiders new.
Spider?
Ee, Uh, yes!
The *spee..ider*. Even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus
Will instantly paralyze... OW!
Get it off!
- Ow!
- Forget it Megamind. Your plans never work.
Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, shall we?
OOOWWW!
It is a great pleasure that I present to
Metro Man, this new museum.
If you please.
Hey! Uh, my kid can't see.
- Megamind.
- Oh, bravo Metro Man.
Booooo!
Yes, I can play along too.
Booooo.
Should have known you'd try to crash the party.
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.
This is the day you and Montrosity, shall not soon forget.
It's pronounced Metro City!
Oh, potato, tomato, potato, tomato.
We all know how this ends.
With you behind bars.
Oh, I'm shaking in my custom baby seal-leather boots.
You will leave, Montrosity.
Or this will be the last you ever hear of,
Roxanne Ritchi!
- Huh?
- Roxanne!
- Don't panic Roxie, I'm on my way.
- I'm not panicking.
In order to stop me, You need to find me first, Metro Man.
We're at the Metroman observatory.
Ah ha, no we're not!
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.
Metro Man approaching, sir.
- HAH!
- Hah, hah!
Hah, hah, hah.
Hold on a second.
Oh, good heavens.
You didn't think you were at the real observatory, did you?
Ready the death ray, Minion.
Death ray, readying.
Over here, old friend.
In case you haven't noticed,
You've fallen right into my trap.
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.
Even the most heartfelt belief, can be corroded with time.
Justice is a noncorrosive metal.
But metals can be melted by the heat of 're-vange'.
It's 'revenge' and it's best served cold.
But it can be easily reheated, in the microwave of evil.
Well I think your warranty is about to expire.
Maybe I got an extended warranty?
Warranties are invalid if you don't use the product for it's intended purpose.
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?
Of course, that is if Metro Man, can withstand the full concentrated power of the... SUN!
FIRE!
Minion, fire...
Uh, it's still warming up, sir.
- Come again?
- Warming up, sir.
Warming up?
The sun is warming up?
One... sssecond... more.
Aaannnd.... jussst.
Tippy, tappy tippy tap, tap, tip top more.
And we are ready, in just.
Oh! I told you to have things running.
Told you out of the sounds.
Why do you always blame me?
My spider bite is acting.
Your plan is failing, just admit it.
Yeah, good luck with that one.
Whose side are you on?
The losing side.
- Thank you.
- Uh, could someone stamp my
You of all people, know that we discontinued that promotion.
- Ta, ta all.
- Same time next week?
What did he just say?
Crab nuggets?
Good lord, I'm trapped.
What kind of trickery is this?
You mad genius.
Your dark gift has finally paid off.
It, it has?
This dome is obviously lined with copper.
- Yeah, so?
- Sir!
Copper drains my powers.
Your weakness is copper?
You're kidding, right?
I don't think even he could survive that.
Well, lets not get our hopes up just yet.
- Look!
- Metro Man.
Metro Man...
Metro Man! AHHH!
Oh god! Oh my god, oh!
Ewwww.
You did it, sir.
I did it?
He did it.
I did it.
He did it.
- You did it, sir.
- I did it!
- You did it.
- I did it!
Montrocity is mine!
You did it sir, you did it, sir.
Yes you did.
All right people, hit it.
Hit it!
Living easy, living free.
Season ticket on a one way ride.
Don't need reason, don’t need rhyme
- Ain't got nothing I'd rather do.
- Drop 'em.
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too,
I'm on the Highway to...
- Highway..
- La, la, la, la, la...
- Highway..
- Ahh, ahh, ahh....
First off, what a turnout.
How wild is this, huh?
All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe.
Are there any questions?
Come on..yes?
You in the back.
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan to do with us.
And the city.
Good, I'm glad you asked that one.
Imagine, the most horrible, terrifying evil thing you could possibly think of.
And multiply it by... SIX!
In the mean time I want you to carry on,
Normal people do.
Let's just have fun with this, come on.
And I will get back to you.
Now slam the door, really hard.
They can... they can still see you.
- Now?
- Yeah, you're still there.
- Oh,
- Let's get going.
There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.
Ahh, Minion.
Did you think this day would ever come?
No way, not at all, sir. Never, never in a million, not even...
Yes, I did.
Look at the intricate moon links.
I'm looking, I'm looking.
And what's this?
Looks like one of the giant monitors, in the lair.
But it seems to only carry one station.
Oh, that sir is called a window.
- Window...
- All the kids are looking through them.
Oooo, I've never had a view before.
Montrosity Minion, it's all mine.
If my parents could see me now.
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down from evil heaven.
Well now that Mr. Goody-two-shoes is out of the way.
I can have, everything I want!
And there's no one to stop me.
All aboard! Ha, ha, haaaa...
Mental wounds healing,
Driving me insane.
I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.
I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.
We may as well go home, as I did on my own.
Alone again, naturally.
To think that only yesterday.
I was cheerful bright and gay.
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do, the role I was about...
I know, I know.
Always thirsty, never satisfied.
I understand you, little well dressed bird.
Purposeless, emptiness, it's a vacuum isn't it. What's your vacuum like?
Going off the rails, on a crazy train, sir.
Hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.
I'm in a heated existential discussion with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy.
I... is something wrong, sir?
Just think about it.
We have it all.
But we have nothing.
It's just to easy now.
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.
- I mean, we did it, right?
- Well, you did it, sir.
Yes you've made that perfectly clear.
- Then why do I feel so, Mel-on-cholly?
- Huh?
Unhappy.
Oh, uh well, uh. What if tomorrow, we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.
That always seems to lift your spirits.
Good idea, Minion. But without him, what's the point?
- Him, sir?
- Nothing.
Okay, um, all right well just uh, that’s uh, something to consider and um, well, I think I'll just power down for a while then.
He was always there for us.
Dependable.
Perhaps we took him for granted.
Maybe we never really know how good we have it, until it's gone.
We miss you, Metro Man.
I, miss you.
And I have just one question for,
Megamind.
Are you happy now?
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a city without a hero.
Coming up next. Are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know.
Aaannd wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas.
- 'Cause we're done.
- Okay, see you tomorrow, Hal.
Wait, Roxie. I'm having a party at my house.
Coming off the hook, or whatever.
You should come over.
I got a DJ rented a bouncy house.
Made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick.
Oh, I don't know, Hal. I don't really fell like being around a bunch of people.
No, no, no. That's why it'll just be, like you and me.
Wow, that uh, that's certainly very tempting.
- But,
- I did hire a wedding photographer.
That's just in case, we were like something crazy happened.
And you'd want a picture of it. Like maybe we should have this for like ever, like a memory, you know.
Um, I'm gonna pass.
I have some work here I need to do. Okay, bye.
So Thursday? Soft, Thursday?
- Goodnight, Hal.
- It's a soft yes, on Thursday.
What's, wrong with me?
Rented a bouncy house? She's don't like bouncy houses, they like clown's.
OW! Ohhh!
Stupid van!
Broken finger!
I've made a horrible mistake.
I didn't mean to destroy you.
I mean, I meant to destroy you.
But I didn't think it would really work.
What are we suppose to do, without you?
I am so tired of running rampant through the streets.
What's the point of being bad when there's no good to try and stop you?
Someone has to stop, Megamind.
Hey, we're closing soon.
Oh, you scared me.
- Barry, right?
- Bernard.
Bernard, I was just well I was talking to myself.
You may think I'm a little bit nuts.
I'm not allowed to self guess directly.
Thank you, I just...
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I have so many evil plans in the works.
The illiteracy beam.
Typhoon cheese.
Robo sheep.
Battles we will now, never have.
You know we never had the chance to say goodbye.
So, it's good that we have this time now.
You know, before I destroy the place.
Nothing personal, it just brings back to many painful memories.
Hello, hello?
Roxanne!
That's a pretty tasteless costume.
- Costume?
- Megamind's head is not that grossly big.
Oh you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun. How...
Hello, is someone there?
Hello, who's there?
Whoa! Hey, hey. Whew.
It's just you, Bernard.
Oh, yes it's just me.
Bernard.
Well thank you for letting me stay.
And thirty seven seconds if I were you.
We're having the walls and ceiling removed.
Wow, that sounds like. Quite the renovation.
I guess I'll. Guess I'll ride down with you then.
I kept thinking he was going to do one of his last minute escapes.
Yeah, he was really good at those.
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.
I've looked into the reset button.
The size is impossible.
Bernard, I didn't know you had... feelings.
Are you okay?
Metro Man is gone. And now there's no one left to challenge Megamind.
Oh, come on, Bernard.
As long as there's evil good will rise up against it.
Ohhh, I wish.
I believe someone is going to stand up to Megamind.
- You really think so?
- Yeah.
I mean, it's like they say.
Heroes aren't born, they're made.
Hero’s can be made. That's it!
- All you need are the right ingredients.
- Yeah.
- Bravery.
- Yes.
- Strength.
- Of course.
- Determination.
- Imperative.
And a smidgen of DNA.
- With that, anyone can be a hero.
- Yeah!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
I think we should run.
Bye.
Time to put the past behind us.
Only the future... AHH!
Oh, that's to much.
I'm definitely scared right now.
Oh, hope no ones seeing this.
Create a hero? A what?
Why would you do that?
So I have someone to fight.
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.
A ying, with no yang.
A bull fighter with no bull to fight.
In other words, I have no purpose.
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.
Go on, ask.
How are you doing to do it?
I'm going to give someone, I don't know who yet.
Metro Man's powers. I'm going to train that someone to become Montrocity's new hero.
Over here, follow.
And then, finally I'm going to fight that hero.
In an epic battle of good and evil.
We could put everything back the way it was.
When the world was perfect.
And rosy. Behold, Minion.
Metro Man's cape.
Look closely.
Tell me what you see?
Dandruff?
Yes, it's his DNA.
From this, we'll extract the source of
Metro Man's awesome power.
Boss, I think this is a bad idea.
Yes, It's a very wickedly bad idea.
For the greater good of man.
But I'm saying this is a kind of bad, bad.
Okay, you might think it's good in your bad perception.
But from a good perception, it is just plain bad.
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.
Now we have just one shot at this.
I must find a suitable subject.
Someone who will do harm to mine.
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.
What on earth is that?
Seems to be emanating from there, sir.
- O-llo,
- Uh, it's hello.
Hello, like that?
- Bernard, it's Roxanne.
- It's Roxanne.
I just want to thank you for inspiring me the other day.
- Oh, You've inspired me too.
- Great!
It's time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can't push us around.
Oh, oh really.
She's so cute.
- I'm already hot on his trail.
- Uh, huh.
And what gives you that idea?
- Uh, sir.
- I just found his secret hideout.
How did she find my hideout?
Uh, how did you find his hideout?
This is the only building in Metro City with a big observatory on the roof.
Okay, there's no way she'll find the secret entrance.
Oh! There's a doormat here that say's 'Secret Entrance'.
- Minion!
- I kept forgetting where it was.
She'll discover all our secrets.
- Ohh, oh no!
- You dim-witted creation of science.
What? Oh, not you Roxanne.
No, I was just yelling at my mothers, urn.
Don't do anything, I'll be right there.
Roxanne?
Oh no, not again.
Roxanne.
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm glad you're here.
How did you get here so fast?
Well, I uh. I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called.
- In a suit?
- Uh huh.
It's called, 'Formal Speed walking'.
But that's not important.
I better take the lead.
This way looks exciting.
No, it says, exit.
Uh, which is the abbreviation for 'Exciting', right?
It's the mother load.
- Ahh.
- Wow.
- Wow.
- Just look at this thing.
You know, I really could use your help in deciphering all this.
- Really?
- You're an expert in all things Megamind, right?
- Yes, right.
- Together we could figure out his plan
Are you in?
- Oh, what fun!
- That's what I want to hear.
Minion,
Code-Send out the brain pods.
You know the whole point of a code is...
Oh code-just do it, Minion.
Ahh, it's me you fools!
Bernard!
It's daddy.
Megamind!
What have you done with, Bernard?
Bernard? Oh yes, I mean poor defenseless,
I don't want to get into it but,
Lasers, spikes.
Oh, please no, not the lasers and the spikes!
You know the drill.
Oh no, not the drill.
- Let him go.
- Or what?
Or I'm going to find out what this weird looking gun does.
No don't!
Don't shoot that gun.
I'll just go get him.
Unhand me you fiend!
It, it's strength's to much.
Oh, I work out.
Argh, it's really paying off.
You're so fit, and strangely charismatic.
Are you okay?
I've did my best.
But he's to fantastic.
Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you.
I got this covered.
Let go, it's mine!
Bernard, help!
Give it to me.
Oh no!
Roxanne.
Ow!
Who on earth is that?
Roxanne!
Bernard, you were right about that door being exciting.
This way.
- Huh!
- What are you doing?
This will stop them, here!
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it.
Just throw it.
Daddy's, suffering.
- Wow, that was real exciting.
- Yeah.
- You were very strong in there.
- I know.
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that.
What's going on?
Hal, what happened?
I think a bee flew up my nose.
I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you, when like fifty ninjas tried to attack me.
So I had to beat them all up, and I did...
- and they were all like crying, so.
- Wow.
Brave one, isn't he.
Who are you?
Oh thi..., this is Bernard.
- He's my partner.
- Partner?
Yes, yes partner.
Well look partner, I'm her partner.
She doesn't know what she's saying. She's been through a traumatic experience.
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.
Yeah, okay.
I'd like that.
That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you accidentally, okay lets end the meeting.
Sir!
Code-Did you find out who it was?
Huh?
Oh, oh.
Code-get the car.
Code-right away, sir.
- Buh bye.
- See you tomorrow, Hal.
I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.
Who is this man, infused with godlike power?
Ow, ow, whoa ho.
Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's twenty eight years old.
No criminal record.
Actually, no records at all.
Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything.
Not yet, Minion.
Not...
...Yet.
Could this day get anymore, funtastic?
So I will just go ahead and defuse him, since this is clearly a mistake.
No, Minion. Something much more powerful is at work.
This is no mistake.
It's destiny.
Hal Stewart, prepare for your destiny.
Hal? Hal Stewart?
Am I saying it right?
Stewart.
Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.
Oh, look. It's Hal Stewart.
Quick, the spray.
- Oops, all out.
- Well use the forget-me-stick.
Oh, right!
Just look at him.
Well, he doesn't look quite the hero type to me.
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.
The power couldn't ask for a finer claim.
I smell hero.
I smell something burning.
I think it's working!
Places, places...
You have your disguise?
What?
Ah, you look fantastic.
Rise, my glorious creation.
Rise, and come to Papa.
What's going on?
- Easy my child.
- Who are you?
I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice.
Honor, and nobility.
I am your father.
So you're like, my space Dad?
Yeah, I'm like your space Dad.
And you are, what?
I'm your space, Step-Mom.
I, I had some work done recently.
Is this some kind of dream?
This is a dream come true.
You've been blethed with unfathomamble power.
What kind of power?
Unfathamomble.
It's un, without Fathom.
- Whoa
- Yeah, we've come to guide you.
On your path to be Montrosity's new hero.
And battle the super genius, of Megamind.
I know this is a lot to take in.
It may take months for you to come to grips..
No frickin' way.
Wahoo! Look at the big hero.
I'm a big hero.
Thee Minion, he's perfect.
Aaannd, action!
- Someone help me.
- I'm okay.
Sun is shinning in the sky
Ohhh, oh!
There ain't a cloud in sight
Zap, zap, zap.
Ha, haaa!
The flames of my evil burn bright.
Now you thay something cool back at me.
Look, it doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.
No, no, no. Shut it down, and stop.
I said slow down.
He's hopeless. HOPELESS!
- Maybe we should change tactics?
- You think so?
Oh, you know how boys are.
They want video games.
I can throw a few parts together.
Can't... wait.
LoL, smiley face.
Can't wait for what, sir?
Oh, that was such a funny story.
And brilliantly told, by the way.
Okay, now you tell one.
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.
And, I never heard you laugh before.
Yeah, it's been a while.
Feels pretty good.
Mr. Blue, you did it right.
And, exit.
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind
I'll remember you this,
I'll remember you this way.
You don't get out much, do you?
Fun!
I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid.
It was one of my favorite things to do.
Now look at it.
It's a dump.
Hey Mr. Blue, we're so please to be with you.
Why are we cleaning up the City, sir?
Um, well we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump, now... do we?
They're all back.
But how, why?
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.
That's it. Be free, my beautiful dove.
Wa haoooo
Okay, okay, Metro Man and I, were never a couple.
But I thought you two were...
I know, everybody did. It's just, well he was never really my type.
Really?
Okay, now you tell me something.
Something you've never told anyone.
Well, in shh-school.
None of the other kids really liked me.
I was always last one picked for everything.
Hmm, it's to bad that we didn't go to the same school.
Hal, I think you're ready for this.
Do I have a son?
No, Hal, you make me laugh.
It stretches, it's for you.
Hey, what's the 'T' stand for?
Titan.
Tighten? What's that suppose to mean?
It was the only name I could trademark.
Oh.
Do you have someone special in your life, Hal?
No not yet, but.
There's this really, really good looking one
I've got my eye on, currently.
That's very good. Romance is very inspiring.
- That's what I hear.
- All you have to do, is save her.
And she'll be yours.
- Who want's Churro's?
- I do!
Thanks spaced out, momma.
On the count of three, unsheathe your Churro.
One, two, three!
To Titan.
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind.
And the city will know your name.
The City's parks' restored to their original glory.
The street's, the safest they've been.
The banks reopened.
Has something happened to Megamind?
Has someone tamed this monster?
This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic, but pleasantly confused.
Well you seem in a very good mood tonight, sir.
Huh, how long is this going to take me?
Just a few alterations, sir. And I'll be done with your most terrifying cape yet.
I'm calling it, Black
Mambaaaaaaa... aaaa... aaa.
Black Mamba, perfect. Ooo, gosh I am running late. I have to go.
What, where, where are you going, sir?
We have our date to battle Titan in the morning.
We haven't even tested your big battle suit yet.
You attend to the details, Minion.
I have to, run a quick errand.
You don't run errands.
What's going on here?
- What?
- Oh, wait a minute.
Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's,
Fleur Du?
It's just my natural musk.
Now, where are the car keys?
Ahhh.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it.
Your going on a date with her.
No my main man, get out of town.
Oh this is bad, this is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.
You are forgetting your place, Minion.
Now give me the keys.
What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?
She will never find out.
That's the point of lying.
Ahhh!
Honestly, If I didn't know any better I'd think this is your first day at being evil.
NO!
This has gone far enough.
Oh, that was really grown up.
Sir please, it's for your own good.
Well what do you know.
I may not know much, but I do know this.
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.
Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.
You heard me.
Who are you?
- Now give me the keys.
- NO!
My soul purpose in life is to look after you.
Well I don't need you to look after me.
What are you... what are you saying?
- You don't need me?
- Let me make it clear.
Code-I don't need you.
You know what, you know what.
Code-I'll just pack my things and go.
Code-Fine!
Code-Fine back.
Well good luck on your date.
- I will.
- That doesn't even make any sense.
I know.
I know I am so close, I can feel it.
Okay, okay I just have to take a step back.
Wait a minute.
Titan.
What's a Titan?
My super ears are burning.
I usually just hear criminals. You haven't been naughty, have you?
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing with you.
The names Titan.
- Titan?
- Your very own heroic guardian
What's your name? Just kidding, I know everything about you.
Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers,
Didn't know what you liked, so I just grabbed you know, all of them.
Okay, you don't like flowers.
Okay, uh, uh, forget the flowers.
- What do you want?
- Thought maybe we could go for a little
- Get to know each other first.
- WHOA!
It's suppose to be very thrilling for you.
Just what do you think you're doing?
Oh are we moving to fast?
You're probably right. I should just rescue you a few times before we get
Whoops!
Saved that, You are lucky to have such a great hero here.
Somebody do something?
No wait, Duh! I gotcha.
That was fun, you almost died.
But I saved you.
- Ahhh, building!
- AHHHH!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Gotcha!
Whoo, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life.
Put me down, right now!
Okay, all right, all right, hold on.
Are you crazy?
I suppose I'm, a little crazy... about you.
Who are you? Really.
Oooh, oooh, right. Well prepare to have your mind blown, little lady.
- Tada!
- Hal?
Yeah, isn't this great?
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.
No, it's not great.
Aww, our first fight. This is so us, we're like an old married couple.
There is no us, okay. There will never be an us.
But, I have powers.
I have a cape, I'm the good guy.
You are a good guy, Hal.
But you don't understand we need to find out why...
Right now, this isn't right.
- Listen to me, Hal.
- You're suppose to be with me.
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.
It's Tighten. It's TIGHTEN, not Hal.
- Bernard.
- Roxanne.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Wow, your hair looks exciting.
Hmm, not the only exciting development of the night.
Megamind's created a new hero.
And I know why.
It all makes sense now.
He missed getting his butt kicked, so he created a new hero to kick it for him.
But why, Hal?
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick.
Wow, that's a lot to take in.
It, it boggles my mind.
I am extremely boggled.
You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of who's kicking who's butt.
But in the mean time.
Let's enjoy each other's company.
I'm sorry, Bernard. Of course, your right, you know, I could use a breather.
To, Bernard. For being the only normal thing in my crazy upside down world.
To... being normal.
- Roxanne.
- Yes?
Say I wasn't so normal.
Say I was bald and had the complexion of a popular primary color.
As a random, not a specific example.
Would you still enjoy my company?
Of course, you don't judge a book by its cover.
Or a person from the outside.
Oh, that's a relief to hear.
You judge them based on their actions.
Well that seems kinda petty, don't you think.
- You.
- What, what?
Oh, don't look at me!
Just, just a technical glitch.
Don't look yet.
My bad.
Where were we?
Now, now, hold on.
YOU!
I can explain.
What about everything you just said?
About judging a book by it's cover.
Well let's take a look at the contents then, shall we?
You destroyed Metro Man.
You took over the city and then you actually got me to care about you.
Why are you so evil?
Tricking me?
What could you possibly hope to gain?
Wait a minute.
Oh, I don't believe this.
Do you really think that I would ever be with you?
No...
Okay Minion, you were right.
I was.... less right.
We should stick to what we're good at.
Being bad.
Minion...
You there.
Yeah, you.
Bring out, the 'Black Mamba'!
Okay, Titan it's time to go down, in style.
I hear there's a new hero.
Who dares to challenge my evil.
Where is the one they call, Titan?
Challenge me, if you dare.
Oh no, we're gonna crash.
This is embarrassing.
Ballsy and incipient.
Boneheaded, irresponsible.
RUDE!
Unprofessional, that's what this is.
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?
Of course not, he was a pro.
Hey, Megamind. You're actually the guy I want to see.
Also, there's a door here.
Do you have any idea how long
I waited for you?
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.
Could you just shut up for one second, I'm trying to beat this score.
Were you even planning on showing up?
What's this?
Where did you get all this stuff?
It doesn't belong to me.
You stole it!
- Pretty cool, right.
- Oh no, no, no. You're a hero.
Being a hero is for losers.
It's work, work, work twenty four seven, and for what?
I only took the gig to get the girl. And it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.
Roxanne Ritchi?
Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi.
I saw her having dinner, and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb.
- Ohhhh
- Who needs all that noise.
That's why I think, WE should team up.
You? Wait! What?
With my power, and your big headedness, we could rule the city.
- You want to team up?
- I even drew up some new costume designs.
- See
- Costume design?
You have a brain so you get a little brain wearing glasses on your costume, or something.
And since I'm the cool one, I'll have like two tanks sword fighting.
I can't believe you.
All your gifts all your powers, and you squander them for your own personal gain.
- Yes!
- NO!
I 'm the villain, you're the good guy.
I do something bad, and you come and get me.
That's why I created you.
Yeah, right. You're nuts.
- Space Dad told me.
- Look, I'm your Space Dad.
You should be more like Metro Man.
You tricked me?
Oh, don't like that, huh?
Well there's more.
I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne.
- No.
- And we were smooching.
Mwah... Mwah... Mwah.
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna, gonna...
YES! Yes I know.
Break me in two. Oh god, how I missed this.
And the hero strikes the first blow.
But evil returns with a backhand.
YES!
Ahh... shhhh.
Come out you little freak!
I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement.
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book.
You little blue, twerp.
En Garde!
Oh, now that's the spirit.
Take, that, and again!
Now it's time for some witty back and forth banter.
You go first.
Look I'm not sure where you're going at.
This one's for pursuing my girlfriend.
This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me.
And Megamind! This is for
Space, Step-Mom.
You lied to her!
Oh, well now, I thought that pummeling went really, really well.
I mean, I have a few notes.
- Notes?
- But they can wait.
You can take me to jail now.
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking more like the morgue.
- You're dead!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This isn't how you play the game.
Game over.
Great button.
I'm calling time out.
Time out, time out!
Brain bots. Initiate the fail safe.
Guess what, Buster Brown?
It's made from Copper. You're powerless against it.
It's a very safe metal used to defeat...
Metro Man?
You, should stop comparing me to Metro Man.
You run Megamind, but you can't hide.
We're saved, we're saved!
What's your name, new hero?
- It's Tighten.
- Thank you, thank you.
Tighten has freed us.
Oh I wouldn't say free.
More like, under new management.
What do you want?
- Titan's turned evil.
- Congratulations, another one of your genius
And why did my doorman let you up?
- Carlos?
- What are you, no, no!
I need your help.
Why do you need MY help?
Because you're the smartest person I know.
Well you can't hide here.
Copper should have worked, why didn't the copper work?
The copper worked perfectly well the last time.
Copper? You're not making any sense.
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness.
He'll destroy the whole city.
Okay, how can I help?
We need to find answers.
You knew Metro Man best.
Did he have a hideout, a cave, a solitary fortress of some kind?
Anything that would give us clues.
Well, there is one place I know.
You gave him these powers, can't you just take them away?
I can't, I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car.
The night you dumped me.
Alone.
In the rain.
- Did you ever look back?
- NO!
- Oh, my giant blue head.
- I guess we're here.
So, this is where he hid it.
After all these years. My old shhool house.
You know, I think there's an apology in order, for the other night.
Okay that would be nice.
But make it quick.
We have much more pressing matters to deal with.
Wow, can't believe he kept all this stuff.
Aww, I remember when he wore that.
Can you just stay focused here?
Yes of course, you're right, focused.
HEY! Come over and look at this.
What is it?
Um..... look!
This glass has ice cubes in it.
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.
No, what I'm saying is, don't you think it's a little odd that the ice hasn't melted yet?
One of life’s great mysteries.
Hey.
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
We now run a confirmed report.
Tighten, first thought to be the
City's new hero, has turned evil.
The city has never seen this level of destruction.
If only Metro Man were still alive.
- You're alive?
- You're alive.
I'm alive.
But..we..we saw your skeleton.
- You were dead.
- Are you a ghost?
There had better be, an amazing explanation for this.
Speak, apparition.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You both deserve the truth.
It all started back at the observatory.
Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna stop you.
My head wasn't in the game that day.
We were kinda going through the motions.
So...
Using my super speed.
I decided to go clear my head.
Then I realized we had done this same silly charade our entire lives.
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.
But I just felt stuck.
I began to realize, despite all my powers, each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn't.
A choice.
Ever since I can remember I've always had to be what the City wanted me to be.
But what about what I wanted to do?
Then it suddenly hit me.
I do have a choice.
I can be whatever I want to be.
No one said this hero thing had to be a life time gig.
You can't just quit either.
That's when I got the brilliant idea...
...to fake my death.
Copper drains my powers!
You're weakness is copper?
Once your death ray hit.
I never felt so alive.
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school.
Metro Man was finally dead.
And Music Man was born.
Music man?
That way I can keep my logo.
- WHAT?
- 'Cause of what?
Finally I'm free, to get in touch with my true power.
Weaving lyrical magic.
Check this out.
I have eyes that can see
right through leaaadd.
- Ewww
- Granted you have talent,
But there's a mad man out there destroying our... your city.
Why did you do this?
The people of the city relied on you, and you deserted them.
No offense.
No, I'm with you.
Look, we need your help.
I'm sorry, I really am.
Um, I'm, I'm done.
You know, little buddy. There's a Ying for every Yang.
If there's bad, good will rise up against it.
It's taken me a long time to find my calling.
Now it's about time, you find yours.
Hey, who needs him.
We can beat Tighten ourselves.
I say we go back to the evil lair.
Grab some ray guns, hold them sideways, and just go all gangsta on 'em.
We can't
So that's it? You're just giving up?
I'm the bad guy.
I don't save the day.
I don't fly off into the sunset, and I don't get the girl.
I'm going home.
Unless someone comes to our aid soon, all may be lost.
Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus.
Remaining citizens are warned, to stay indoors until further notice.
Authorities have issued a warning, to stay out of the downtown area at all costs.
Hal!
Hal!
Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am, you've finally come to your senses.
Well, I'm over you.
I've come to stop you, Hal.
You? Oh, well. Okay, what are you going to do, report me to death?
I was going to try reasoning with you.
You and I, we worked together for a long time.
I know you.
You don't know me.
You never took the time to know me.
This is the first time we've hung out socially.
And it's when I'm about to destroy the city.
I want to talk to the real Hal.
I want to talk to the guy who loved being a camera man, and eating dip,
And being a nerd and being not as scary as the Tighten-Hal.
To late!
Megamind.
You and I have some unfinished business.
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower, oh, and just so you don't get cold feet.
Roxanne!
Come on Roxi, call for your hero to come rescue you.
Megamind.
I don't even know if you're listening, but if you are...
You can't give up.
The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight.
Even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning.
It was your best quality.
You need to be that guy, right now.
The city needs you.
I need you.
Roxanne.
You have one hour.
Don't... keep me waiting.
Warden, Warden!
Listen to me, you have to let me go.
Tighten has to be stopped.
Sorry Megamind, you still have 88 life sentences to go.
Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done.
If you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.
Here it is. Black is part of my heart.
I.... AM.... Sorry!
Not buying it.
I don't blame you.
I've terrorized the city countless times.
Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain.
I lied to Roxanne, and...
My best friend, Minion.
I treated like dirt.
Please, don't make this city,
Don't make Roxanne pay for my wrong doings.
Apology accepted.
Uh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you.
What are we waiting for?
We'd better get going.
You got me!
Good luck, fellows.
We're gonna die!
Wait, what?
Hey, Metro losers.
This is Metro Tower.
They say it's suppose to be a symbol of our cities strength.
But, for me, it's a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart.
And I hate reminders.
HAL!
Please don't do this.
I know there's still good in you, Hal.
You're so naive, Roxie.
You see the good in everybody, even when it's not there.
You're weaving a fantasy.
There is no Easter bunny.
There is no tooth fairy.
And there is no Queen of England.
This is the real world.
And you need to wake up.
You dare to challenge Megamind?
This town isn't big enough for two super villains.
Oh, you're a villain all right.
Just not the super one.
Yeah, what’s the difference?
PRESENTATION!
I knew you'd come back.
Well, that makes one of us.
- What's the plan?
- Well, mostly involves, not dying.
I, like that plan.
I can't control it.
No!
Well, that was easy.
Looks like there's only one loose end now.
Please, let's have a little respect for public transportation.
You came back.
You were right, Roxanne.
I never should have left.
Whoa, I... I thought you were dead.
My death was, greatly exaggerated.
So, you're the punk I've heard about.
Whoa!
I'm sorry, I did the best I could.
I'm so proud of you.
Minion?
Surprise! Heh, heh, heh.
He's the real hero.
Megamind.
Going somewhere?
Besides jail.
No, not in the face there, please.
If you know what's good for you Tighten.
You'll stay out of Montrosity.
- You got it!
- Good!
Pretty sneaky, sis.
But there is only one person I know who calls this town, Montrosity.
Ooops.
You!
Bet you think it's really funny, huh?
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh.
You're not going to be laughing no more.
The invisible car. Hey, remember that night that I dumped you?
You are bringing this up now?
I did look back.
You did?
YOU DID!
Yes, and you should look back, right now.
Oh, I get it.
This is the last time you'll make a fool out of me.
I made you a hero.
You did the fool thing, all by yourself.
Oh, uh...
You're so pathetic.
No matter what side you're on.
You're always the looser.
There's a benefit to loosing.
You get to learn from your mistakes.
What?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.
Enjoy your flight.
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Megamind.
So, this is how it ends.
Normally I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure.
But not today!
What can I say?
Old habits die hard.
Say bye, bye Roxie.
Ollo.
Thing about bad guys, they always LOOSE!
Ohhhh.
You did it, you won.
Well, I finally had a reason to win.
You.
MINION!
Can't see it's cold and... warm, and dark and light.
It's me, Minion.
I'm right here.
We've had a lot of adventures together.
You and I.
We have, Minion.
I mean... most of them ended in horrible failure, but,
We won today.
Didn't we, sir?
Yes Minion, we did it.
Thanks to you.
Code-We're the good guys now.
Code-I guess we are.
Oh, oh. I'm going... I mean this is...
This is it, I mean I'm going far awa...
Oh, what a drama queen.
You know, I'm feeling much better now.
I guess I just needed a swim
- He had you, didn't he.
- Whew!
Classic, Minion.
Don't give them the face.
There he is with that little face. Look at that face.
We did it!
We did it!
- Fist pump!
- You did it!
We won, we won, we won.
What! Get back you savages!
Sorry, sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.
Funny, I guess destiny is not the
But the path we choose for ourselves.
All right, put your hands in the air.
Now hand over your wallets.
I'm just kidding.
Just kidding.
I have to admit.
Being good, has its perks.
You know, you look pretty good in white.
Megamind, if you please.
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.
Sorry my friend.
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew you had it in you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
MEGAMIND!
Defender of Metro City.
You know, I like the sound of that.
Hit it!

How dare you?
I mean, how dare you lie and try to embarrass me in front of my students.
- I wasn't lying.
- Thaùs a lie on top of a lie.
Ugh! You're not one of my pupils.
What school are you playing hooky from?

You disgusting little street urchin!
You could be locked up for this.
Where's the sheriff?
Please. I didn't do anything.
Your skirt got caught on a nail.
Yes!

Gentlemen,
I propose to say...
Passamaquoddy's a beautiful community... where the sun always rises and the sun always sets.

Iùs a place of serenity and security, where the unexpected never happens.

He pulled off

- He walked through my cement with his big feet.

His great big fin is right against the door #
# So board up all the windows #
# And get down on the floor #
Has anybody seen my dad?
Nora, please, my child, come in.
- Get off that street.
- Whaùs the matter?
- Worst thing I ever saw in my life out on the street.
- What was it?
- I don't want to tell you for fear iùll scare you to death!
- Scare me.
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon #
# His tail lashing, he'll be smashing every shop in town #
# With scaly feet he'll crack the street and tear the steeple down #
# Iùs not some loony dream
I heard a scream from Sheriff Brown #
# Iùs true, iùs true
Oh, what are we to do #
- # Iùs true, iùs true #
- # Old Lampie's in a stew #
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear there was a dragon #
# You're off your hinges
All those binges put you in a haze #
# You crazy fools
Iùs all your doggone fault he's in a daze #
# Let go of me, let go of me and mend your wicked ways #
- [Braying]
- Aah!
# What makes you think there ever was, there never was #
# There never, never, ever was a dragon, dragon, dragon #
# Dragon, dragon dragon, dragon, dragon #
# Dragon, dragon, dragon dragon, dragon, dragon #
[Screaming]
[Cheering]
# There never, never, never never, never, never, never #
# Never, never, never, never never, never, never, never #
# Never, never, never was a dragon #
[Grumbling,
Indistinct]
- Now, why don't you just calm down?
- I seen his face.
If you wanna call it a face.
It was this close to me.
Why don't you lie down, Dad? Come on.
You know what else?
It started to smile at me.
- Well, did you smile back?
- I didn't have time to smile.
I was too busy running.
And you know...
And you know what else?
There was this boy with it.
And he wasn't afraid.
- This boy...
- Lie down.

# [Humming]
We're in a lot of trouble, and iùs all your fault.
[Sighing]
[Inhaling]
[Exhaling]
[Inhaling, Exhaling]
I don't wanna play.
You did everything wrong is Passamaquoddy.
Now everybody hates us.
I don't know whether you're good for me... or bad.
[Sniffles]
I'm sorry, Elliott.
I didn't really mean that.
Iùs just
I don't know what to do, and I'm scared.
[Sniffles]
[Groans]
Hello in there!
[Whispering]
Get back!
[Grumbling, Grunting]
Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just playing tic-tac-toe.
[Chuckling] Well, this isn't exactly the best place for tic-tac-toe.
The tide's coming in.
High water reaches this cave sometimes.
You better head for home.
You're not from
Passamaquoddy, are you?
Nope.
Just sort of... travelling.
Where are your parents?
Where are you staying?
- Whaùs your name?
- Pete.
I'm Nora, and I have to get back on watch, up in the lighthouse.
There's chowder on the stove, if you'd like some.
Wh-Whaùs the matter?
Iùs a hand, not a shark.
You can finish that chowder... if you'd like.
[Exhales, Sniffles]
Oh, I forgot something.
Be right back.
I forgive you, Elliott.
- [Giggles]
- [Sighs, Chuckles]
Stay here till I see what iùs like up in the lighthouse.
Woo-woo-woo-woo!
The Gogans own me,
I guess.
They said it was against the law for me to ever leave them.
Where did you get that bruise?
Mr Gogan. I was milking the cow, and I missed the bucket.
- Had he done that before?
- All the time.
The first time I ran away, the orphan home sent me back.
This time,
I'll just keep running.
Well, you'll be safe here.
Nora, no one's ever been this nice to me. I'll always remember it.
Pete, why don't you sleep here tonight?
We'll figure out what to do tomorrow.
Okay?
Wonderful.
I've got work to do. Come on.
Are you anybody's mother?
I'm not even anybody's wife.
But you're gonna get married now, aren't you?
[Scoffs] I'm already married to this lighthouse.
- Who's that?
- Paul.
- Is he part of your family?
- He almost was.
- How can someone almost be part of a family?
- We were going to be married.
How come you weren't?
Well, as far as we know, his ship was headed for a storm.
They were never heard from again.
That was a year ago.
He'll come back.
I tell myself the same thing every day, standing up there watching for ships on the horizon.
[Sighs] Time I should be thinking of other things, so they tell me.
I'll have to ask
Elliott about Paul.
He has a way of knowing things.
Who's Elliott?
- My dragon.
- Dragon?
[Gasps]
So you're the boy with the dragon.
- Yup.
- Where is he?
- Down in the cave.
- Thaùs interesting.
I've never known anyone with a dragon.
What does he look like?
Just a plain, ordinary dragon.
How plain?
How ordinary?
# He has the head of a camel #
# The neck of a crocodile #
It sounds rather strange.
# He's both a fish and a mammal #
# And I hope he'll never change #
# 'Cause iùs not easy to find someone who cares #
# Iùs not easy to find magic in pairs #
# I'm glad I found him
I love him #
# I won't let him get away #
# 'Cause iùs not easy #
# You say the head of a camel #
- # The neck of a crocodile #
- And the ears of a cow!
# Iùs clear that friends can be different #
# Yes, I understand you now #
[Together] # Iùs not easy to find someone who cares #
# Iùs not easy to find magic in pairs #
# Now that you have him
Hold him #
# Treasure him from day to day #
# Iùs so easy #
# Life is lollipops and raindrops #
# With the one you love #
# Someone you can always be with #
# Argue and agree with #
# Climb the highest tree with #
[Together]
# Iùs not easy #
# To share somebody's dream #
# It gets easy when you work as a team #
# You've got to tend it
Fan it #
# Thaùs what
I plan to do #
# Oh, I had one friend by my side #
# Now I have two #
# Him and you #
# Him and me #
[Together]
# And iùs so easy #
# [Humming]
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, son.
- Nice to see you again.
- Ah. Thank you.
Aah!
- Iùs you!
- Whaùs the matter?
Iùs you.
The boy with the dragon.
Yes, sir.
[Screaming]
Dad! Dad, what is it?
- The boy with the dragon.
- I know, I know. Now, just take it easy.
You saw it.
You saw it?
I didn't actually see it, but I know what it looks like.
- But wha...
- We'll talk about it later.
O-One thing I must know:
It isn't in the lighthouse, is it?
- No, Ellioùs down in the cave.
- Oh, Ellio...
Elliott? Lt... It even has a name.
There's nothing to get upset about.
You're right. Right, there's nothing to get upset about.
Nothing. No, why should I get upset?
I should be happy.
L... I should be happy! I'll go down to the saloon and I'll tell the boys.
I'll say, "Boys, here it is."
And then hear the apologies. [Laughs]
Ellioùll be happy to do it for you, sir.
Good boy. Good lad.
Just you and me and Elliott.
We'll go into the saloon.
Oh. Elliott...
He won't... won't start to scratch or... or fight, or set anything on fire, will he?
- Well, he's sort of...
- Sort of what?
- Unpredictable.
- Now, don't do anything with Elliott.
Wh-Why don't you leave him where he is?
- Iùs too dangerous to take him into town.
- Iùs dangerous.
Now, I don't want either one of you to say a word about Elliott...
- to anyone, do you understand,
- No. No. Yes!
Until we've talked this over.
Now, leùs all have breakfast. The lamp has to be polished, the lens cleaned, and I want to take Pete to buy new clothes.
Yes, well, clean Elliott and eat the lamp.
I mean, we'll... clea-clean the lamp.
[Muttering] Elliott!
The name's Elliott. Did you hear that?
Doc Terminus is comin'!
Are they still after us?
We lost 'em.
Good.
- Passamaquoddy ahead, ahoy!
- What?
Pass-a-ma-quoddy ahead, ahoy!
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
All hands on deck!
Here comes the Doc!
[Dog Barking]
- [Screams] Slow down!
- My fence!
Wet! Wet!
Iùs still wet!
[Screaming]
Throw out the anchor!
Since we all concur, gentlemen,
I suggest that we adjourn.
[Screams]
[Townspeople Screaming]
When did I start losing control of my town?
[Both Screaming]
- You dummy!
- You told me to drop the anchor.
I dropped the anchor.
[Groaning]
- Watch Bones.
- Get him off of me! Get him off!
I think they remember us.
Uh-oh. I think
I remember them.
- Just act normal.
- I am acting normal. I'm ready to run.
Quick, whaùs the name of this town again?
Passamaquoddy.
- "Quassama" what?
- Passamaquoddy!
Got it. How wonderful to see your smiling faces again.
All of you.
I-I've never known such warmth, such welcome, such loving hospitality.
Get out, ya quack!
And don't bring those phoney remedies here again.
Go on back where you belong: Jail.
- [Booing]
- Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I sense enthusiasm,
I sense loving response, and thaùs why I feel that this is my home... away from home.

Oh, Doctor! Oh, Doctor!

Someone in need.
A human being crying out to another great human being, for a service only I can provide.
Madam, Dr Terminus is here to cure you.

Pete, if you bring up the oil can, we'll be ready for the night.
Sure. Before that, I'd like to show Elliott my new suit.
No! No, no.
You can't bring Elliott up here.
Government regulation 302 states that... no dragons shall be allowed... on the premises of the United States' lighthouses.
Now, go on down and get the oil so I can mark it up in the log that you did that.
Okay. Nora, first can
I bring Paul's picture down to Elliott?
Then he can start looking for Paul.
All right.
[Door Opens,
Closes]
- Thanks, Dad.
- For what?
- For making believe about the dragon and going along with it.
- Making...
It means a lot to Pete.
Sort of a family he made up.
I'm not making believe.
I actually saw it.
And I haven't been the same since!
Go to the cave; you'd see it too, and your eyes would...
- [Popping] pop right out!
- [Scoffs]
I was there.
I saw nothing!
Dad, be realistic.
Oh, you wanna be realistic.
Leùs talk about how realistic you are.
Here you are, waiting for someone to come back that just ain't gonna come back, Nora.
And if waitin' for over a year hasn't told ya nothin', then you're not the one to talk about being realistic, are you?
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
I'm going down to the hardware store.

Hi, Elliott!
How do you like my new suit?
Wow!
[Panting]
[Gibberish]
And new shoes too.
Look at the way they shine!
[Laughing]
Nora's so nice to me,
I want us to do something for her.
I want you to concentrate on finding Paul for Nora.
This is what he looks like.
[Gibberish]
Remember his face.
Try real hard.
Hmm.
[Gibberish]
Better go now.

- See ya tomorrow.

[Giggling]
Twelve times a day till iùs empty, then come back.
One dollar, please.
Thank you.
I'm getting tired.
Sick and tired... of having to explain why we have a sail instead of horses.
Would you rather tell them how I gave the horses away in Matawanakey... to settle a malpractice suit, hmm?
- No.
- Well, don't worry.
When we leave here, we'll have horses again and plenty more.
- More what?
- More everything.
- Whoo!
- More anything! I don't know.
Do you mind if I sound optimistic?
This is the worst town on our route.
I hate Pass... Pass...
- Pastafazooli, or whatever the name is.
- Quoddy.
Yeah! I don't wanna cure anybody here.
- They all deserve to have whatever they have.
- I'll drink to that.
I've had nothing, nothing but bad luck in this burg.
Hey! Ooh...
- I'm sorry, Doc.
- You see what I mean, hmm?
Doc, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, Hoagy.
- I di... Can I buy everybody a round?
- Yeah.
Huh? Well... Hey, 'cause,
Doc, I gotta talk to you. Okay?
- Sit down.
- May I? Thank you.
Hey, you're a ma...
You're a man of science, ain't you?
A man of science, yes.
Yes, I am.
With degrees from the Royal Medical College, London.
- Huh?
- The Gleinen Einen Peitzen in Vienna.
- Oh!
- And the Moulin Rouge in Paris.
Why do you think they call me Doc?
Because they sail their boats into me, hmm?
Eh?
[Chuckling]
Oh. You know anything about dragons?
Of course I do. I see them in all the big cities going down the streets, with that funny little walk, wearing bright colours, fluttering around...
No, no, no. I'm talkin' about a real dragon.
Real dragon. With fire... fire coming out of his mouth.
And he's got real wings.
Uh, you need a veterinarian. Hmm?
- Why do you ask?
- I saw one.
Is it sitting at the next table?
Hmm? [Chuckling]
I tell ya, I saw a real dragon yesterday afternoon.
He's owned... owned by a young boy... by the name of Pete.
You are trying to tell me that there is a dragon here...
- In Passamacracka? Yeah.
- "Quoddy."
- Yes.
- I told you this was a rotten town.
Well, in my educated opinion, sir,
- I think you've been up in your lighthouse too long.
- Huh?
Wait. Wait, listen. What if what
I just told you was true?
In my scientific opinion, the existence of a dragon... would have an impact of gigantic proportions.
Mythology and legend would become history and science.
- One could really make a quick buck with it.
- Well, I can prove it.
I can prove it!
H-His name is Elliott.
[Stammering] H-He's downstairs.
You could go and see him right now.
Unfortunately,
I cannot make it right now.
I have an appointment with a young lady who's interested in a nursing career.
- Oh. Oh.
- I wanna see it.
- You wanna see it?
Well, see it you shall!
- Okay.
But first...
First, leùs have a quick one... because of the rocks we have to climb.
And the dragon...
The dragon is scary.
Okay, we'll have one for the rocks.
And one for the scary.
- Quoddy.
- Hmm?
Shh!
Nora. Shh!
We don't...
We don't...
- We don't want Nora to hear us.
- Shh.
- Huh?
- Shh.
- We don't want Nora to hear us.
- Shh.
I tell you that he's in there.
[Deep Sighing]
[Lips Smacking]
- Are you convinced?
- Absolutely.
- Well, leùs get outta here.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a mi...
I-I want to pet him.
Huh? You wa...
You want to pet him?
Are you crazy?
I know you ain't drunk.
No matter what you see in here, don't get scared.
[Footsteps]
Hey, I might as well tell you straight off, you're gonna see a hideous monster.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
And iùs big.
Fifty feet of terror!
Claws! Claws so sharp they could tear a man to shreds.
- [Gulps]
- Eyes, evil eyes... that can see right through ya.
And a tail thaùs so big and powerful, it could destroy the hull of a frigate!
It can wipe out an entire crew... with one swish of his tail.
Face... Face so terrible, it could turn a man to stone, a hero into a coward.
A flame so hot, it could roast a turkey!
And a mouth so terrible, it could devour a man and...
[Spits] spit him 20 leagues.
Stay close.
[Sputtering]
Iùs g-g-g-got m-me.
[Screams]
[Stammering]
Look at it!

Can't stop shaking, and I am smiling.

Hello. Hello. Hello, Elliott.

Aah! Hey, see how smart he is?
- [Whimpering]
- He said hello to me.
Yeah! He likes me!
- Y-You do somethin' so he'll like you.

Yeah. Do somethin' to make him like you.

S-s-s-s-s-s...
- Saw it.
- Saw what?
El-El-El...
Dra-Dra-Dra...
What is an "el-el-el dra-dra-dra," hmm?
Dr-Dr-Dragon.
[Panting]
I-I saw the dragon.
L-Lampie wasn't lying.
Iùs real. It belched flame at me.
Belched?
You saw a belching dragon?
You sure you weren't belching yourself in front of the mirror?
N-Never saw anything so horrible in my life.
Th-Thought
I was a goner.
There was no need for him to do that.
I only offered him a sociable drink.
Hoagy, I can't stand you when you're drunk.
Doc, look at me.
I'm not drunk.
What I saw tonight sobered me in a second.
I swear... I swear to you, there's a big, horrible dragon... up in that cave, I swear.
I just realized,
I can't stand you when you're sober!
Now, get out of here. Get yourself a good, stiff drink. Out!
I swear.
A vicious dragon.
Out!
Dragon.
# [Humming]
Nine and nine are eighteen.
Really?
Nine times nine are eighty-one.
Amazing!
Two thousand pounds make a ton.
Wow!
That sign says "Passamaquoddy."
- You still have to go to school.
- Do I have to like it?
Like it or hate it, you have to go.
Do you wanna be stupid when you grow up, like the Gogans?
Okay, I like it.
I like it.
- Isn't that the boy with the dragon?
- I think so. Leùs go see.
Come on.
- Are you the boy with the dragon?
- Yep.
- Is it a he or a she?
- You don't name girls Elliott.
- Where is he?
- Following me.
- Elliott the dragon is walking right there.
- I can't seem to make out his colour.
- Mostly green.
- He's not too big, is he?
- Regular dragon size.
- Wow!
- Pete? School.
- Gee!
I ain't got hardly nothin' to sell.
So? I pulled my nets in, and there weren't a fish in 'em.
I just docked. There ain't nothin' out in that ocean but water.
Iùs real strange,
I'm tellin' ya.
Iùs like every fish sorta disappeared.
Just suddenly up and disappeared.
There's the cause of it.
That kid Pete.
From the day he come to town, the fishing turned sour.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Iùs that crazy dragon talk of his.
That kiÔs been nothin' but bad luck wherever he goes.
You're a bunch of superstitious ding-dongs.
You know that fishing grounds shift from time to time.
Ellioùll make the fish come back.
There he goes, talkin' dragons again.
Hey, kid! There ain't no room in this town for a dragon, and there ain't no room in this town for jinxes like you, neither!
Well, if there's enough room for a chowderhead like you, then there's more than enough room for a dragon.
# There's room for everyone in this world #

[Ringing Continues]
You're late. You're late.
Late. Late. Late.
Late.
Why is everybody late?
We were playing with
Nora, Pete and his dragon.
- His wagon?
- No, dragon!
Dragon, wagon. Thaùs no excuse for being late. Get inside.
Good morning, Miss Taylor.
Good morning. Thank you for making my students late... and for disrupting the entire schedule.
- You have a new student.
- I have?
This is Pete.
Oh, him.
If he's a transfer,
I'll have to have his records.
Unfortunately, his old school burned down and his records were destroyed.
- Pete, give her nine times nine.
- Eighty-one.
Then I'll have to have his birth certificate.
Tragically, the flames from the school house... set fire to the city hall, and his certificate went up with it.
- Pete, give her a ton.
- Two thousand pounds.
Do you want him to spell
Passamaquoddy?
No, no, no. This is irregular, irregular, irregular.
But he needs an education, education, education.
Surely you can't disagree with that.
I would if I could, but I can't.
[Bell Ringing]
Why is the bell ringing?
There's no one out there.
I'll stop it.
- Elliott, stop it!
- [Elliott Chattering]
The bell isn't supposed to ring till recess!
- Stop that!
- I'm not doing it.
Liar. Liar, liar.
Iùs the knuckle cracker for you.
Three for lying and three... for whom the bell tolls. Come.
Put your hands out.
Palms down, knuckles up.
One. Two.
- Three! Four!
- It doesn't hurt much, Elliott.
- Whom are you talking to? Five, six!
- Elliott!
- Whom?
- My dragon.
- [Laughing]
- Your dragon, wagon.
Nothing but a network of lies!
Three more for your imagination!
Seven! Eight!
And a great big nine!
Go stand in the corner.
[Huffs]
Work, work, work, everyone.
All this nonsense about a dragon.
# [Elliott Humming]
- No, Elliott!
- You did it! You pulled the chair out from under me.
- It was Elliott.
- [Gasps] That does it.
You've had a taste of the knuckle cracker.
Now you'll have a dose of the behind breaker.
- Bend over.
- [Elliott Growling, Thumping]
[Screaming]
No, no, Elliott.
Get out!
[Elliott Grunting]
- [Crowd Chattering]
- [Elliott Growling]
No, Elliott, you're going about this the wrong way.
- Go back to the cave. Go on!
- [Elliott Grumbling]
[Man]
Jehoshaphat! Would you look at that!
- Why do I hear a bell ringing?
- School must be out.
Iùs too early, stupid.
See, I told you.
School is out.
- Wait! Whaùs happening?
- Pete's dragon wrecked the school!
I told you.
I told you!
[Man]
Whaùs happened over there? Something crashed right through the school.
Look at it, I'm telling you.
Iùs a big hole in the side of the wall.
And a dragon came in through one wall... and went out the other wall.
Now do you believe me?
[Chuckling]
- You think this kid Pete would sell it?
- Money talks.
First there's a dragon.
Now he tells me money talks.
Will miracles never cease?
Dragons, dragons, dragons.
Dragons.

Good morning, Miss Nora.
So, this is where you live, eh?
At last we've seen the light.
[Chuckling]
I tell you, you've got to have a sense of humour these days.
- And you must be Pete.
- Yes, sir!
I'm Dr Terminus, and this is Hoagy, who's doing his internship with me.
I heard about the incident at school yesterday.
- I'd rather not discuss it.
- I realize you must be disturbed about it, and, uh, up to here in dragons.
You know, Pete, I have always loved dragons.
They're such wonderful creatures.
When they're not busy destroying things, of course.
I've had a dream since
I was your age that one day...
I would have my very own dragon.
I would consider my life to be fulfilled... and would be most grateful if you would sell me your dragon.
You wanna buy Elliott?
Sight unseen. As is.
We'll give him a good home. Bless him.
I couldn't sell him.
Sure you could! Thaùs what life is all about: Buying and selling.
- I'll give ya three dollars.
- [Whispering] Offer him four!
I'll offer him five.
Iùll make his head swim.
Five... dollars.
I can't sell him.
I don't own him.
- Well, what did ya do, rent him?
- Well, who owns him?
Well, nobody, I guess.
He just came to me.
He only goes to those who need him.
I need him.
Listen, Doc, I don't know what you're up to, but you better forget about this.
- He's not for sale.
- Nora, go paint your lighthouse.
Pete, my boy, you're conversant with Elliott.
Now, talk to him.
Tell him how much I need him.
Deliver Elliott to me and the fiver is yours, plus a bottle of my medicine thaùs guaranteed to bring on puberty two years ahead of time, and thaùs better than a dragon, hmm?
[Chuckling]
- Doc, maybe you should talk to Elliott yourself.
- Mm-hmm.
Wh-Where is he?
Does he speak English?
Down the beach.
- Where?
- Right there, by the water.
- Right. I still don't see...
- Thaùs because he's invisible today.
[Laughing]
They know they're sitting on a gold mine.
Well, they've had their chance to make a few dollars.
That dragon doesn't belong to anybody.
He's fair game, and he's gonna be ours!
# We'll bind him up, grind him up
Lock him up, chop him up #
# Can't you hear that jingle-jangle sound #
- # Oh yeah #
- [Cackling]
# Iùs money, money, money by the pound #
- [Horn Blowing]
- Ahh!
[Laughing]
Uh! Ah-ah-ah!
[Laughing]
Fog! Fog!
- Where's the fog?
- There's not much fog.
We were just using the horn to chase off a few buzzards.
Few buzzards. Nora, how many times must l...
Oh, started already, huh?
Look, if you're gonna whitewash, son, let your brush go up and down, up... thaùs a boy... and down.
- Up and down. Up and down.
- Thaùs right.
- [Chuckling]
- This is fun.
If iùs so much fun, I'm gonna leave it to you and Nora to finish up... while I go in and take a nice little nap.
This is the best time
I've ever had in my whole life.
- It is?
- Yeah.
Tell him, Nora.
Pete, Lampie and I have talked it over.
- We feel the time has come for you to stop running.
- Yes, iùs true.
If iùs all right with you, we'd like you to live here with us.
Oh, Nora, Lampie, do you mean this could be my real home?
- It certainly does.
- And Elliott too?
- Well, l...
- Sure, and Elliott too.
But Elliott has to live in the cave.
All right, he will.
- Oh.
- [Lampie Chuckling]
No, no, no!
Not on me! Not on me!
On the side of the building, please, huh?
- Now up... Up and down.
- And down. Up and down.
You know what?

Whoa, boy. Say, have you seen anything of a mean, fresh kid...
'bout yea big?
Answers to the name of Pete.
Half of the kids in this town answer to the name of Pete.
Other half don't answer.
- Let me break his bones, Pa!
- Just a minute!
This particular Pete, he's always talkin'... to his big, hokey-pokey, uh, whatchamacallit, uh...
- Dragon.
- Dragon?
Merle, this here's the place.
Come on, Willie.
It would be unethical of me to leave my patient at a time like this.
Iùs important.
About the dragon.
Put your foot on there.
Now, don't move, stay tense, or that weight will fall, that clamp will break your jaw, tear your gums apart and go through your cheek.
- Tense. Tense!
- [Whimpering]
[Whimpering]
See that wagonload of worms? They're lookin' for the kid and the dragon.
I knew there'd be competition.
Come on.
[Lampie]
Careful as you bring 'em aside.
I got one!
I got one!
Ugh! Iùs ugly!
Well! If it ain't our own little Petey!
- [Cackling]
- The Gogans!
Well, you look so nice and clean, and those new clothes.
I guess all those good manners
I taught you done paid off.
Who's that pretty lady you're with, little Pete?
- Yeah. Introduce us.
- Yeah. Introduce us.
I'm Nora, and Pete is staying with me.
Why, boys, I believe she's tryin' to break up our happy little family.
Elliott went to look for Paul.
I wish he were here.
Don't worry. They won't get you.
Come on, Dad.
I guess we're gonna take him back now, miss, to his own home, sweet home.
- Come on, Pete.
- You won't be taking him anywhere!
Okay, lady. We're gonna take him whether you like it or not.
- Right, boys?
- Right, Pa.
Willie, you grab onto Pete, while I hold onto her.
You grab Pete.
I wanna hold her.
- I wanna hold her!
- Well, I'm gonna hold her!
[Squabbling]
All right!
I'll settle this.
You two grab the brat.
I'll hold her.
Lf'n you think you're gonna hold her like my boys wanna hold her, you're gonna be holdin' your head, ya understand?
Lady, that boy is ours!
# We got a bill of sale right here #
# That says he belongs to us #
# We bought him fair and square last year #
# And we own the little cuss #
# Look here

# That gives us a legal claim #
[Gogans] # Oh, we got a bill of sale right here #
# With dear little Petey's name #
I don't believe it.
# We got a bill of sale in hand
And lady, if you don't budge #
# We'll pick you up right where you stand and bring you before the judge #
No, sir.
# That boy is our property same as the family cow #

Iùs downright dangerous, getting all wet like this.
We done had our bath in May!
Ahh-ahh-ahh...
- [Sneezing]
- [Men] Bless you, Ma.
- [Coughing]
- Excuse me, folks.
I witnessed what happened today, and I'm completely sympathetic with you.
- Whaùs sympathetic mean?
- I'm Doc Terminus. Like to talk to you.
Oh, Doc, I got this here "poomonia."
- Sit down.
- Ahh-ahh-ahh...
[Sneezing]
- Bless you, Ma.
- Bless you, Ma.
[Groaning, Panting]
I got this terrible ache in my back!
Good. Whaùs rightfully yours is rightfully yours.
Now, you want Pete, right?
- Right!
- Right!
- Right!
I want... the dragon.
- The dragon?
- The dragon?
- [Laughing]
W-W-Wait a minute.
Now I got a stitch in my side.
You really want the dragon?
Very much. Mm-hmm.
Well, then, what are you willing to give for it?
The help you need getting Pete.
I'll need the same kind of help getting the dragon.
[Cackling]
[Laughing]
N-Now I think the pain's in my head!
- Have we got a deal?
- Sure.
We scratch your back, you scratch ours.
The boathouse, sunset, hmm?
Uh, Doc.
What you gonna do with a dragon?
Oh, maybe put him on a ranch, breed him. Hmm?
Big stud fees.
Ahoy. Ahoy. Here.
How would you like to make the fishing good again?
- How do we do that?
- Catch that dragon!
Set a trap for him, throw a net over him, drag him away.
Goodbye, Elliott.
Hello, fish. Hmm?
Sunset, the boathouse.
Spread the word, hmm?
[Fishermen Murmuring
In Agreement]
Get back!
Get back!
Dr Terminus! Here's that there harpoon you wanted!
Good! Put it right over there!
[Ma]
Now you just remember our bargain!
Okay, I want separate trip lines on the primary tarp, the secondary net and on the tertiary.
- T-Tertiary?
- Whaùs that?
Dragon medicine.
[Cackling]
- Okay, fix it.
- We've done it!
Don't signal till you're re...
- [Men Shouting]
- Get this net up off of me!
Will you get this... Will you get this net up! Up! Up!
Now, I've gotta go and get that kid.
You rehearse this and make it run like clockwork or else.
Elliott!
Oh, Elliott, you were terrific the way you saved us from the Gogans.
- [Laughing]
- What?
[Gibberish]
Do you mean it?
[Clicking Tongue]
Wow! Thaùs great.
You're the most wonderful dragon in the whole world.
[Soft Growling,
Clicking Tongue]
Wait till I tell Nora!
# [Humming]
Nora! Nora! Good news!
Elliott found Paul, and he's on his way home!
- Pete...
- I wouldn't say anything like that if I were you.
But iùs true.
Elliott said.
Please.
There's been enough talk about Paul, and Elliott too.
[Sighing]
Both of us have to be... realistic.
Paul's ship went down.
He's not coming back.
And I have to adjust my life to it.
You have to make a big adjustment too.
You have us now.
You don't have to make believe your only friend is a dragon.
But I'm not making believe.
Thaùs what I mean by "realistic."
There are no dragons.
Except for Elliott.
He's real.
Lampie, you've seen him, haven't you?
Well, l...
I thought I saw him.
Wait till Paul gets here. Then you'll know how realistic Elliott is.
Okay.
Until that time, leùs try not to talk about it.
How about filling the reserve oil can?
Sure.
Well, at least one of us is entitled to have illusions.
[Thunderclap]
[Wind Howling]
Pete! Pete, iùs Elliott!
- Whaùs the matter?
- Ellioùs in Passapaka... Pakadaka...
He's in town, and he's tearing the place apart.
- You've gotta do something.
- Oh, no!
[Laughing]
We should be in the channel.
We shoulÔve made
Passamaquoddy Light by now.
There it is!
Iùs my home port.
I didn't think I'd ever see it again.
- Iùs a welcome sight.
- Looks great to me.
I know the light keepers personally.
- He's in there! Come on!
- Elliott! Elliott!
Did I say the primary was really the tertiary?
[Men Shouting]
Never!
- Where's Elliott?
- Nowhere!
Your hokey-pokey dragon's out helping Santa Claus pull his sled!
- Boys!
- Let me go!
Now you're never gonna get away again!
We're gonna put chains on you when you're workin'!
- And when you're not workin'.
- And when you're sleepin'!
Okay, okay. Tear him to pieces in your own time.
Right now he is the bait for the trap.
Take him in there where that thing can see him when he comes through the door.
He'll head straight for Pete.
We spring the trap.
After the tertiary net drops on him,
I'll give you the signal, and you fire the harpoon right into the middle.
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Got it?
Got it!
But what I don't got is, h-h-how you gonna get that monster, that hideous beast, that nightmare sent by the devil, to come here?
Easy. We get someone he knows to bring him here.
Well, who'd be crazy enough to do that?
No! No!
He knows you.
He trusts you.
He scares me!
He hates me!
Hoagy.
We are all on this earth for a purpose, and the time for your purpose is now.
I know that inside this pale, frail, pathetic shell of a man... there is a Vesuvius ready to erupt.
Now, I've known you, man and beast, since, since you were nothing.
But now, Hoagy, now, you're still nothing, but you could be something!
You can be a somebody.
A legend, Hoagy. A legend in your own lifetime, not a joke!
The momenùs here, Hoagy.
Grab it. Grab it!
Today the jester.
Tomorrow the king!
- No!
- Get out!
[Whimpering]
[Elliott Snoring]
E-Elliott.
C-Can you come out here for a second? Please?
[Snoring]
[Gasping]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
Wake up.
W-W-Wake up!
[Snarling]
D-D-Don't get n-n-nervous!
I'm a friend.
[Groaning, Snorting]
Don't roast me!
[Snarling]
Boo!

H-Hon... Honest.
L-l-I-I-I got a m-mess... m-m-m-message about P-P-Pete!

Got P-P-P-Pete!
- [Bellowing]
- Ahh!
[Snarling, Roaring]
Aaah!
Follow me!
[Thunderclap]
Captain, the lighùs gone!
There's a reef between us and the channel.
Dad, I can't find Pete.
- Can you get it lit?
- I have to put in a dry wick.
Battle stations!
[Hoagy] I told you!
I told you, Elliott! There he is!
Look out, Elliott!
Iùs a trap!
Aaah! Get him!
He's right here!
Drop everything!
Drop everything!
[Men Shouting]
[Elliott Bellowing]
Elliott, over here!
[Hoagy] Get me out of here!
Elliott, don't step on me!
- Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?
- Iùs beginnin' to look like a...
- Dragon!
- Don't say that!
I've got it!
We've done it! Out!
We've got it!
We've got it!
- Hoagy!
- [Elliott Growling]
Please!
Please, let me out!
- Doc, please!
- Get out of there! Get out of there!
- Doc, get me out!
Get me out! Get me out!
- Okay. Okay!
[Growling]
- [Growling]
- [Men Shouting]
- Help! Over here!
- Don't say that!
Tie him down!
Help, Elliott, help!
Man this harpoon. Take this.
[Chuckling]
Light the fuse.
No, no!
Don't shoot Elliott!
[Ma Screaming,
Shouting]
[Pa]
Get him back! Get him back!
The other.
- [Pa] Pick him up!
- [Ma] Take him outside!
[Hoagy]
Get out of the way!
- [Whimpering]
- [Screaming]
He's going!
Let me get a bead on him!
- Elliott, save me!
- [Ma] Don't let him get away again!
Get him outta here!
- Hands...
- Elliott, don't let 'em take me!
[Growling]
[Roaring]
[Stammering]
Wait! Wait!
[Ma Shouting]
- [Muttering]
- [Gogans Whimpering]
Huh? Pete!
- Thanks, Elliott.
- [Muttering]
You just listen to me!
That there boy belongs to me!
I paid fifty dollars for him, plus legals, and I got a bill of sale right here to prove it.
[Snarling]
- Boo.
- [Screaming]
[Ma] Merle, help! Get me out of here!
Don't just stand there!
Come on! Get me outta here!
Get me out of here!
[Ma]
You clucks!
[Elliott Laughing]
- [Grunting, Groaning]
- [Ma] Let him keep the brat!
[Roaring]
[Ma]
Come on! Get in the wagon!
[Shouting]
[Ma]
Wait! Wait for us!
[Elliott Howling]
Daaah-ah-ah!
Aaah-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[Screaming]
Aaah! Doh!
Hoagy, get me down!
We've gotta do something!
That dragon's gonna get away!
[Snarling]
[Whimpering]
Where is he? Where is he?
Elliott! Wait!
Wait, Elliott!
I wanna make a deal with ya.
To buy up all your used and spare parts, you know, like a hangnail, or if you shed your skin, or if your hair falls out,
I'll pay you top dollar!
Whaùs the matter with you?
Don't you have any business sense?
- Don't shout!
- Elliott! Elliott!
[Screaming]
He's gonna eat us up!
[Growling]
Oh!
[Whimpering]
[Wagon Crashing]
...in the street.
Quite a storm here.
Wait a minute.
Watch those stairs.
- [Gasping]
- [Electricity Crackling]
Oh, look!
Th-Th-There really is a dragon!
Yes, and he saved us!
- Dragon!
- A dragon! A real dragon!
- Attaboy, Elliott.
- [Muttering]
[Clicking Tongue]
That ship's headed for the reef!
Go down and sound the foghorn!
[Foghorn Blowing]
Elliott, quick! Quick!
[Foghorn Blowing]
[Ship Creaking]
Nora, let me have the light so I can see what I'm doing.
[Foghorn Blowing]
Come on, Elliott.
You can do it.
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- I got it!
Come on, Elliott.
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- Come on, Elliott!
[Panting]
[Pete]
Hurry!
Whaùs the matter?
Everything is wet in here, thaùs whaùs the matter!
- Don't worry, Lampie. Elliott came.
- Elliott?
Thaùs all I need is a dragon in here. Ah!
Get him outta here!
[Muttering]
Start your burner, Elliott.
Light the wick.
[Gibberish]
- [Clicking Tongue]
- All right, Elliott. Go ahead. Light it.
[Pete]
Now, Elliott! Now!
All right.
Where's the fire?
- [Groaning]
- Whaùs the matter?
[Gibberish, Sputtering]
- He's all squished up in the stairs.
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- [Elliott Blowing]
- El-Elliott?
- [Gibberish]
He's real.
He's really real.
[Muttering,
Clicking Tongue]
- Of course he is.
He's gonna light the wick.
- Can he do it?
Can he? He can throw a flame clear across to Bar Harbor... if he can get his own burner goin'!
[Gasping]
- Come on, Elliott!
- [Whining]
- Go on!
Come on, Elliott!
Come on!
[Lampie]
Blow, Elliott!
[Drawing A Deep Breath]
- Wow! [Panting]
- [Pete] Elliott, you did it!
[Gibberish,
Clicking Tongue]
Look there!
That means the harbor is dead ahead, Captain!
Hard right rudder!
Elliott, I could give you a great big kiss.
[Shuddering]
# A dragon, a dragon
You bet we saw a dragon #
# So big and brave, he came to save a village in distress #
# He kept the ship from crashing when he heard the S.O.S. #
# He faced a group of villains and he fought them with success #
# He's great
He's great #
- # A chum #
- # A pal #
- # A mate #
# A dragon, a dragon
We're proud to love a dragon #
# Before he came to fight the storm the night was dark and dim #
# Now everyone in town is safe again because of him #
# He filled the ocean full of fish
He packed it to the brim #
# We want it known that he's our very own #
Nora! Nora!
Paul!
[Elliott Muttering]
- What happened?
- We sank in a storm off Cape Patters.
I was the only survivor.
When I woke up in the hospital,
I'd lost my memory.
Then the other day, a strange thing happened.
My bed suddenly tipped over.
I don't know how, but I bumped my head and everything came back to me.
- Iùs a miracle!
- [Chattering]
Iùs Elliott.
Gather around, everyone. I'm going to have a few appropriate words to say.
Gather around. Come on.
Closer, closer.
There you are, yes.
Iùs nice to see you.
Ladies...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pete, I want you to thank
Elliott the dragon... for the council here and all the townspeople.
- You do that?
- Well, he's right here.
He'd appreciate it if you'd thank him yourself.
- [Laughter]
- You mean I can talk right to him, huh?
Go right to the main source.
That was my campaign...
- No, he's over here.
- Oh! Oh, over that side.
So, uh, on behalf of...
[Laughter]
[Muttering]
Thank you.
# Iùs a brazzle dazzle day #
- # So throw off the past and everything in it #
- [Elliott Clicking Tongue]
# Thaùs the brazzle dazzle way #
# Enjoying your time from minute to minute #
Hi!
Oh, Elliott, you're the greatest.
You've made everybody happy, especially me.
I'm very proud of you.
[Muttering]
We've got a real family now and a place to live.
[Clearing Throat]
[Gibberish]
You've gotta go?
When will you be back?
[Gulping, Muttering,
Sniffling]
You... You won't be back?
[Muttering]
But why?
Did I do something wrong?
[Muttering]
[Snarling]
There's another kid in trouble?
[Muttering,
Growling]
[Soft Roar]
Well, if anyone can get him out of it, you can.
- Ohh...
- [Giggling]
[Muttering]
I won't see you again, will I?
Ever.
[Sniffling, Whimpering]
[Sniffling]
What are you sniffing for?
[Gasping, Sneezing]
[Laughing]
[Chuckling]
Now, remember, don't scare people.
[Gibberish]
Goodbye, Elliott.
Goodbye.
[Gibberish]
- It is a dragon!
- [Pete, Lampie, Nora] Iùs Elliott!
[Pete] And remember, you're supposed to be invisible!
It's funny how you wake up each day
and never really know if it will be one that will change your life forever.
But that's what this day was.
The day I left the city to spend a week in the house where my mother grew up.
A day I'll never forget.
So many years have passed
Almost there. Feeling all right?
I'm okay.
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Come in the garden
And look at the trees
I used to play there when I was a child
Oh, Hara.
How many times have I told her?
Wait here. All right? I won't be a minute.
Okay.
Hara! Your car's blocking the driveway again.
So many years have passed
The dew is still on the roses
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Shawn? Where are you?
Shawn?
I'm here, Aunt Jessica.
Come meet Hara!
Supper is done and night has come
Let's have tea together near the fireplace
Nice try.
My house, my home ls so small, so pretty
My mom, my dad We are family
Joy everywhere
Hey, back off!
Hey! Go get your own!
Arrietty!
What?
You went outside again, didn't you?
How many times have I...
What happened to your room?
It's my own little garden.
If you ask me it looks more like your own little jungle.
Is that a bay leaf?
Where did you get that?
I wanted to wait and give it to you on your birthday, but...
Happy birthday!
This will last me all year.
But the bay tree is so far away.
If a bean saw you it would...
Beans don't scare me.
The beans should scare you.
That's what worries me.
The world is a dangerous place for a Borrower.
Your Aunt Eggletina wasn't scared either and she...
Was eaten by a toad. I know, I know.
If you don't like your gift
I can put it in my room.
No, no, I should keep it.
I have just the recipe for these.
I'll have your father borrow some sugar.
Oh, you don't have to.
Because tonight I'll borrow some for you.
What?
Don't tell me you forgot!
Tonight's my first borrowing!
Look, Papa's home.
Papa. Papa, I made it all the way to the bay tree today.
And I used the leaves over my head just like you said.
And I didn't even get seen by the cat.
So, what I'm trying to say,
- if there was any doubt...
- There's a new bean in the house.
What?
- I know. I saw him.
- Arrietty, I told you to be...
Yes, Mama, I was careful and he didn't see me.
And he's much smaller than other beans.
Papa, you just have to let me come borrowing tonight.
We know nothing about this new bean.
But you promised this would be my night.
And I've seen him.
Papa, please, I am telling you, he's just a child.
And the children are more vicious than the grownups.
I'll be fine.
Well, the young beans do go to bed early.
Oh, thank you, Papa!
Pod!
The boy is very sickly and weak.
She'll be fine.
But...
Oh, and don't worry, Mother.
I'll get Papa back safely.
Arrietty will be turning 14 soon.
She'll need to know how to take care of herself out there.
Without our help.
Sometimes I worry that we are the only Borrowers left.
What'll become of us?
Remember what the doctor said, Shawn.
Your heart needs rest. No excitement.
- Is that clear, Hara?
- Yes, ma'am, I'll see to it.
Whatever you need, Shawn, you ask Hara,
- and she'll get it for you, all right?
- Yes, Aunt Jessica.
Make him feel at home, Hara.
Yes, ma'am.
We'll start by keeping the bugs out.
Don't you think you should wear something a little darker and longer?
No, I think this one's perfect.
So, I need you to get me some tissue paper and some sugar.
Oh, and promise, dear husband, you won't let our daughter get eaten or squashed like a bug.
Oh, please God. Please help them.
Don't worry about me. Everything's fine.
Okay, bye, Mom. I love you.
Oh, goodbye. Love you, too.
Stay close to your father.
I will
Do I get one of those?
Nope? Okay.
Arrietty!
Did you see that?
That's my girl.
Don't look down.
One step at a time.
All right. You need to hold this for me.
Okay.
Arrietty, make sure you hold on tight.
Arrietty!
- Let's go.
- Right.
It's so big.
Papa, what is this place?
This is where beans store all their food.
The sugar is over there.
When you get down there, wait for me.
Yeah!
Papa, you are great!
Yay!
There. That wasn't so hard.
- Where to now?
- Tissue paper. Then home.
Papa, look what I found.
Looks like someone got their first borrowing.
Careful with it, it's sharp.
Okay.
Papa, borrowing is so much fun!
Look down there.
Filthy rats.
You want to stay away from those things.
I'm not afraid.
I will cut them down to size with my sword.
Sometimes it's best not to go looking for danger.
What is this place?
I've heard human beans call it a dollhouse.
Dolls are toys for beans.
And we are not toys.
These things are not for borrowing.
Oh, but it's so perfect for us.
Don't you think Mother would absolutely love that dresser over there?
If anything went missing, they'd know right away.
Borrowers take only what they need.
Don't be afraid, okay?
Hey.
I know it was you in the garden.
I knew I saw you.
My mother used to tell me stories about the little people who lived under the floors.
Was it you?
Was it?
Please don't go.
I'm sorry. I should have told you.
He might have seen me out in the garden today.
We all make mistakes.
So we'll just have to be extra careful now.
Best not to tell your mother about this.
You know how she worries.
Right.
I'm very proud of you.
A lesser Borrower would've panicked and run away.
Well, we're home.
Safe and sound.
Is everything okay?
Not quite the adventure we'd hoped for.
This old light gave out halfway to the kitchen.
No.
Well, I'm afraid we had to give up on the sugar.
That's okay.
I'm just happy you made it home.
It wasn't a total loss.
Arrietty, why don't you show your mother your first borrowing?
What a beautiful pin.
Okay. Off to bed.
Night, Mama, Papa.
She looks so worn-out.
Should I make us some tea?
Shawn, come inside.
You'll catch your death of cold.
What did you say?
Why would he do that?
I think he was just being nice.
It's the same cube of sugar
I dropped in his room last night.
Pod, what does she mean, she dropped it?
Do not touch it. Do you understand me?
It's a trap.
I just know it. They're going to trap us like cockroaches.
Homily, let's try not to get hysterical, okay?
Don't tell me to not get hysterical!
We'll probably have to move now.
Goodbye, old table.
We had so many fun times together.
Let's not say goodbye to anything just yet.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
I told you that young bean would be trouble!
But no one ever listens to me.
Thank you, Arrietty.
Smart girl, doing this when the sun came out.
Or maybe I have a smart mama who taught me.
You're a good girl.
If you've got this,
I think I'll go lie down a bit.
Okay.
Is that you from last night?
No, wait. Don't go.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Please leave us alone.
We don't need your help.
But can I please just talk to you?
No! Human beans are dangerous.
Whenever we're seen, we have to move.
My parents said so.
So you have a family. That must be nice.
You don't have a family?
Yeah, I have one.
But they sent me here to get the care and attention I need.
Because they're both very busy with their work.
Sorry to hear that.
Anyway, my name is Shawn.
What's your name?
What do they call you?
Not that it's any of your business, but it's Arrietty.
Arrietty. Arrietty.
That's a beautiful name.
Maybe we could be friends?
Could you at least come out so I can see you?
I want to make sure I'm not dreaming.
I won't hurt you, I promise.
Help me! Help me!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What in the world? A crow!
Oh! Attack! OW!
You get out right now!
What got into that bird?
Don't think I've ever seen one behave like that.
Maybe it's nesting season or something.
I don't know.
Looks me to like it was after something.
Oh, look at the holes in the screen.
Which I'll have to replace, of course.
Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?
Your aunt said for you not to get too excited!
Should I get your medicine?
No, that's okay, Miss Hara.
I'm actually feeling pretty good.
Nesting season?
Well, Shawn, you have a nice, long rest now.
Papa!
I hear you visited the young bean.
I'm sorry.
I went to ask him to leave us alone.
But I really don't think he intends to hurt us.
Many Borrowers have lost their lives thinking the same.
It must never happen again.
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.
We'd better start looking for a new home.
The boy knows that we're here.
Are we safe?
Delivery. Package for you, ma'am.
Thanks for the drink, Hara.
It's pretty hot today.
Do you happen to know of any good pest control companies?
Pest problem?
Here's one.
"Squeaky Klean Pest Extermination."
1-800... Oh, hang on.
So you got yourself a mouse problem?
Maybe it's mice, maybe it's little tiny people.
Strange things have been happening here and I know why.
That's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.
I mean, when Hara told me,
I just couldn't believe it.
Why on earth would a crow try to fly into your room?
Were you frightened?
No, I wasn't scared.
Hara came and chased it away
And it's a good thing I came in when I did.
That bird had huge wings and claws...
Let's not relive the excitement, Hara, considering Shawn came here for a little peace and quiet and tranquility before his operation.
Yes, ma'am. Forgive me.
I'm sorry, Hara.
I don't mean to be short with you.
But why his mother chose this time to go away on business is just beyond...
It must be terribly hard for you without your mother here to look after you.
You know, not so much lately.
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped, but honestly, why couldn't she be here when her son needs her so?
It's the last thing his poor heart needs.
Aunt Jessica, I was noticing that miniature house in my room.
And the detail's amazing.
Oh, you mean the dollhouse.
That beautiful little house belonged to your mother.
She had to leave it here when she moved away to go to college.
It was Mother's?
Your grandfather had it specially made because he was hoping it would be a lovely home for the little people.
What?
That's right.
Little people who lived in the walls.
He was quite obsessed with them.
People laughed, of course, and called him mad.
But your mother, she believed him.
They worked on that house together for hours.
And he told her they would come, but of course, they never did.
Tell me, Shawn, have you ever seen any tiny little people in your room?
Can't say that I have.
I think it's why your mother doesn't like to come here any more.
Too many memories of wishes that never came true.
Can we look inside it?
Yes!
You know, I haven't looked inside it in quite a long time.
Hara, could you be a dear and turn off the lights?
Ma'am.
So many years have passed
This is the living room.
Your grandfather had all of this handmade by a real furniture maker in England.
Isn't that just insane?
Look at the attention to detail.
They really were preparing it for someone to live in.
And just in case you don't believe what I'm saying is absolutely true, have a look at that room right there.
Come in the garden
What a kitchen!
And look at the trees
Everything in it a miniature of the real thing.
That oven actually works.
You could bake real cookies.
Some really little cookies.
What a pity their dream never came true.
It really would've made a lovely home.
Settled down there long ago
So many years have passed
The dew is still on the roses
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Come in the garden
And sit on the grass
I used to sit there when I was a child
Ivy and moss
Little daisies
Covered the lane long ago
You know, Mother, we've had these same pictures for years.
Wouldn't you like some new ones?
Well, Arrietty, I like those pictures.
And I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.
Besides, there's no point in changing them now.
I wonder what's taking Papa so long.
Why is my first thought always that he got eaten by the cat?
What's wrong with me?
There he is!
Does he look eaten?
Hey, Papa, how was it out there?
I slipped and twisted my leg.
I'm lucky that Spiller here found me.
Well, what is going on down...
Pod, you're hurt!
It was the cat, wasn't it?
See, I'm not crazy.
Get up here!
Does it hurt, Papa?
It's just a sprain. Go calm your mother.
I'll get some cold water. I'll be right back.
Everyone relax!
Here's a towel. Dry yourself.
Who's that?
I wonder if he has news about any of the other Borrowers.
Okay, I leave now.
Can't you at least stay and have some tea?
Arrietty, I'll take care of your father.
Why don't you see if Spiller would like a cup of tea?
Won't you please stay, Spiller?
I've never met another Borrower before.
We can't thank you enough for your help.
Tell us, have you seen other Borrowers?
We're all alone here and we're starting to believe we're the only ones left. Are we?
This many.
Oh! Then cousin Lupy could still be alive.
Oh, that's a bow, isn't it? Can I see it?
You use this for your borrowing?
Give that back, Arrietty, before you shoot someone's eye out.
Okay. Go now.
Oh, but couldn't you stay a little bit longer?
I'll cook dinner.
Already got this.
A cricket leg!
Want some?
- Very fresh.
- No, thanks.
Bye.
Thank you, my friend.
I'll go with him. To see him out.
What were you doing out there in that storm?
I was looking for a safe route for our journey.
And now I know which route not to take.
Oh, Pod.
Spiller knows of more Borrowers a few days journey away.
There's a small river past the forest.
He's offered to take us on it.
That's great.
I'm sure we'll find a new place in no time.
And I'm sure it will almost be as nice as this.
I'm really glad I met you, Spiller.
Or that I met anyone.
Hey, maybe next time you could bring your whole family with you.
No family. Only Spiller.
Well, we... We could be a family.
And when you come back you could stay for a family dinner.
Hara?
Arrietty, your stitches need to be closer together.
You'll have to start over.
Why do we need such a big bag anyway?
Are we putting the whole house in here?
I think I'm gonna go check on Papa.
Papa, can I come in?
- How's your leg?
- Well, better than that cricket's.
I'm serious.
Papa, why do we have to move?
Once a Borrower has been seen, the beans' curiosity can't be stopped.
Well, isn't it possible that not every human bean is dangerous?
Arrietty, before you were born there were two other families who were living in this house.
One family went missing, they just disappeared.
The other one moved away.
They were seen by humans.
And so, we have to do whatever it takes to survive.
But, Papa...
Oh! Oh, no!
Pod, what is it? An earthquake?
Mother!
It won't open!
Frame is buckled!
The wall!
Homily!
Homily, are you all right?
Pod, remember how I always said
I wanted a new kitchen?
More bills.
Remember, take only the things we need.
We can't possibly carry all of this.
And, Homily, don't take anything from the dollhouse.
I'm gonna go make sure that it's safe.
- You stay with your mother.
- Okay.
So you finally came.
Did you like your new kitchen?
Well, our house looks like a train wreck.
But it doesn't matter.
Because I came to tell you goodbye.
Can I turn around?
You're beautiful.
My papa said we have to move now.
We've been seen, and Borrowers aren't supposed to be seen.
What are Borrowers?
My mother, father, and I are all Borrowers.
We borrow things that beans won't miss if they are gone.
Just little things, soap, cookies, and sugar.
All things that we need to survive.
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.
I think my grandfather saw one of you once.
It's possible.
And it's my fault that you're leaving.
Niya! Niya!
Don't be like that. Be nice to her.
So, in my aunt's house, how many other Borrowers are there who are living with you?
It's just my father and my mother and me.
What about in other houses?
I'm sure there are some.
But I've only met one other so far.
You must be afraid you'll be the only ones of your kind who are left.
What?
Every year there's fewer and fewer of you, right?
Aren't you scared that soon you'll all be gone?
What a horrible thing to say!
I know that there's more of us because Spiller said so!
Who's Spiller?
He's one of us. He lives out in the forest, and he said that there are hundreds more of us.
That might be true.
But, you know, none of us can live forever, can we?
We all have to die sometime.
Why would you say something like that?
Because it's true.
I guess so.
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.
Sometimes things happen to us that are just beyond our control.
And when these things happen, there's really nothing you can do about it.
You just accept it and prepare for the worst.
I wish it wasn't that way.
But you can't live a life that's built on nothing but wishes.
It isn't practical.
Sometimes you just have to accept the hand of fate.
Oh, no, you don't.
Sometimes you have to stand up and fight for the things that are worth fighting for.
You have to survive.
That's what my papa says.
And so we're leaving even though it's dangerous.
And we are going to survive.
We are Borrowers and we'll make do.
We always have.
As long as we have each other to live for, we'll keep on living.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm actually the one who's going to die.
What?
There's something wrong with my heart.
They're gonna operate next week but it probably won't help.
That's terrible.
I've always been sick and I've had someone looking after me.
And that's why when I saw you,
I just wanted to find a way to protect you.
But I guess I messed up.
I made it worse. I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry to hear about your heart.
Now what on earth is this doing here?
Now how did you get in there?
There you are!
Mom!
What? What's wrong?
My mother, I think she's in danger.
No!
Give me that, you little thief!
Now we'll see who they call crazy.
And I bet there's more of you, aren't there?
Wait, no! Wait, wait! Wait!
I have to go help her.
But...
Oh, no! Help! No, no, please! Help!
Pod! Arrietty!
Let me out of here!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Let me out of here!
Arrietty! Help!
Watch it!
Let's see.
Now to find the others.
Let me out! No! No!
Something terrible has happened.
- Squeaky Klean.
- Yes, hello.
I'm calling from 833 Elm Lane.
Could you get out here right away?
I have a very unique pest problem.
- Is it mice?
- Oh, much worse than mice.
Do you want them exterminated?
No, I need you to trap them.
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!
Shawn! Shawn!
Arrietty!
My mother is missing.
Someone took the roof off!
I think a human bean got her.
Oh, Mama.
We will find her.
What?
Someone's locked us in.
There's a room next door. Hold on tight.
One step at a time.
Right.
It's stuck!
Wait.
I can get us in.
Oh, no, no!
Keep going.
What do you mean you're lost?
How can you possibly be lost?
It's the only road!
- Is it before the bridge?
- What bridge? There's no bridge!
Hara must have found it and opened it.
This is what I was afraid of.
Mother's been taken.
Are you okay?
Be careful. Shawn, please.
Where are those idiots?
Mother! Where are you?
Be wise.
They're supposed to catch pests.
But... HOW did you...
Hara.
Could I have some warm milk?
Okay! Wait just a minute.
Thank you, Hara.
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?
Cookies? Now he wants cookies.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Arrietty!
Over here!
Arrietty! Here I am! Here I am!
Oh, Mother!
Oh, Arrietty.
Oh, good. There they are.
They finally found the road.
The only road.
Another bean!
It's okay, Mother. He's a friend.
Ma'am, we'd like to take a look around.
See what we see.
Yes, of course.
Squeaky Klean Exterminators?
Hara? Hara!
Oh!
What's going on here?
It's finally happened.
I found the little people.
Little people?
Yes! And what little robbers they are.
I wouldn't have believed it either unless I'd seen it with my own eyes.
It's remarkable!
It's the eighth wonder of the world.
And they're so teeny!
And they have a whole house full of things they've stolen.
Are you sure you didn't find the sherry again?
All these years you thought I was losing things.
But it wasn't me. It was them!
You didn't mention little people to the exterminators, did you?
No. I didn't want to scare them off.
Because I'm sure the house is just full of them.
You'll see when I show you.
This is their nest.
Nest?
Looks like a pile of old junk to me.
What?
It was here! It was here!
Where's that little teapot?
Okay, Hara,
I'm sending the exterminators away.
No! No, no! Wait just a minute.
Oh. Oh! I'll clean that up later.
Oh, please!
Hello, Shawn.
Can we come in for a minute?
It's open.
You'll see.
Those little thieves stole the tiny kitchen.
I don't know how they did it, but the whole thing is gone.
Not gone.
Perhaps you need a little time off, Hara.
Yeah.
Wait! Wait! I can prove it!
I've got one of them in a jar!
Poor Hara.
I think she's finally gone bonkers.
Do I smell fresh herbs?
Someone's been making tea.
It's just as my father told us.
There really are little people living here.
Yes, there are.
Your mother really should be here to see this.
She waited so long for some proof of them.
But they're not thieves like Hara said.
They're just Borrowers.
What?
I mean, they must be very frightened.
I just hope they're still here.
I hope so, too.
Excuse me. Ma'am!
Where would you like us to start looking?
Oh, are you all right?
Where did she go?
Who took my lady?
There are little people! There are!
Easy, 68$)'
And, no, I'm not losing my mind!
If I collapse, leave me behind.
With my tea kettle.
You're doing great. It's just a little further until we break for food.
Can't we just head back?
We can live with the rats in the compost heap.
Oh, no!
Let's hurry.
I can't do it.
Arrietty, you really should eat something.
We're gonna be walking at least until morning.
What?
I'm so sorry.
I feel like maybe it's all my fault that we had to leave such a wonderful house.
That's in the past.
We'll make another wonderful house, the three of us, together.
I'm going outside for a bit.
Arrietty, don't go too far.
Niya.
Niya.
Just a little further.
Spiller!
That's the last of it.
Come on, we should keep moving.
Okay.
Mother, are you all right?
Arrietty!
Arrietty!
Shawn.
Arrietty.
We have to leave.
But Spiller says there's more of us not too far from here.
A two-day's journey, at most.
He thinks it might be my mother's family.
You won't be the last of your kind.
But how did you find me?
Niya here showed me the way.
Thank you, Niya. Take care of him.
I brought you something.
Now think of it as a gift from one friend to another.
Thank you, Shawn.
I have to go.
When is your operation?
Tomorrow. But I'm not scared.
Because someone taught me how to be brave.
So you'll remember me.
How can I forget you?
You protected me after all.
Arrietty.
I hope you have a happy life.
Goodbye, Shawn.
Arrietty, my heart is strong now because you're in it.
And you always will be.
Forever.
I never saw her again.
But the following summer I returned
and was happy to hear the people in the house down the road
talking about how many things in their home had gone
missing.
I'm 14 years old, I am pretty
I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady
I live under the kitchen floor
Right here, not so far from you
Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel blue
In my dreams, oh, I wish I could
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky and the summer rain
Pick a flower from the garden for you
Now I know there's another world
Butterﬂies floating in the air
There is someone out there for me
Walking down, picket fence
Run my hands along the edge
And music plays in my head
Hear the song before I go to bed
When stars are bright outside my window
Wake up to tree boughs filled up with snow
And I remember Oh, I remember
I remember my summer with you
Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
I'd fly to you
All the way across the states
I'd fly to you
Hear me, the winter day
Oh, I'd follow the sun and come right to your door
I remember my summer with you
Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
I will miss you in summer again when
I will miss you in summer again when
Still.
Wiegend.
I wish to enrol.
To enrol? Certainly?
This way...if you please.
Keine Bewegung, bitte.
Moment, bitte.
Außergewöhnlich...
Sir? Herr Benjamenta?
I'm here to enrol.
These are students I have hammered into Europe.
Bitte, setzen.
Asseyez-vous!
So...Name. Date of birth.
It's on the concession.
Und so weiter, und so weiter.
Etc, etc...
..etc, etc.
Das ist?
Ah...
Von Gunten.
Eintausend, zweitausend, dreitausend, viertausend, fünftausend.
Jakob.
A few other details, Herr von Gunten.
Wollen doch mal sehen.
Ja.
Ganz gute Reaktion.
I have sought entrance to the Institute Benjamenta as a student...
..in order to acquire the necessary knowledge for being a servant...
..as I have no high hopes of life.
I hope - no I am quite certain - that I am fit.
I...
Glitschig.
I hope I am quite certain that in some measure
I am fit to be of service to someone in this life.
To someone in this life.
Jakob von Gunten wishes to affirm that he...
Drei, vier, fünf, sechs.
..wishes to affirm that it is a matter of indifference to him what he is ordered to
Sechs, sieben, acht, neun...
..as his modesty knows no bounds.
Zwölf.
Ja...ein kapitaler Zwölfender.
Ugh. Agh.
It's good your hair is short.
There's an epidemic of tics...
..in the forest here.
You can put aside any idea of preferential treatment.
You're all one size here.
You can go now, von Gunten.
The class of life has already started.
Don't I get a receipt?
Go! Raus!
Kapitaler Zwölfender.
Flammenartige...
I refer you to your manuals, the chapter headed...
..The Divine Duty of Servants.
Danke.
Jakob von Gunten.
Gut.
Herr Jakob, these are your fellow students.
Kraus.
Auclair. Barcelonnette.
Fridolin. Fisoloebede.
Schilinski. Nyepertatikva.
Jorgenson. Aarhus.
Hebling. Fnetenberbel.
Pepino. D'Agrigento.
Inigo. Euskadikoa.
One.
Service is a beautiful, gold flower, full of...
We have to learn the rules by heart.
There is but one lesson here...
..endlessly repeated...
..over and over again.
One will learn very little here.
And none of us will amount to much.
Later in life, we shall all be something very small and subordinate.
..are his ears at the word of command, and folded and pressed at all times are his lips.
Except to say, 'Yes, sir, at once, sir. Of course, sir.'
Next page.
Herr Jakob, will you please join us next time?
Three.
The satisfaction of his master shall be the servant's heaven.
The woeful opposite is his annihilating hell.
Can't. Can't. Can't eat this. It's impossible.
I won't. I won't.
I won't stand up until you promise me a decent room to sleep in.
Fräulein Benjamenta, I beg of you.
You... You won't ever, never, never, never, have to complain about my behaviour again.
Is that so?
I shall never have to complain?
Such a fuss about where to lay your head.
Hm.
Go up.
Is this more to your liking?
Well, it's small... and the window scarcely merits the name.
There are no curtains, but don't be angry, Fräulein, I like it.
Even if the sun never gets a look in.
I like it.
Thank you.
Well...
Well, now my comrades are sure to feel offended.
And now be quiet, Herr Jakob.
Class commences at eight. Kraus will collect you.
Good night.
I shall never let myself be rescued...
..nor shall I ever rescue anybody.
Why can't there be a light in the light, instead of just in the dark?
Perhaps I shall never put out roots and branches.
One day, some fragrance will issue from my being and I will flower.
I will bow my head, and my arms and legs will sag.
Everything will wither and fade...
..and I will be dead.
Not really dead.
Only in a certain sort of way.
Dead.
Then I will go on dying for perhaps another 60 years.
Instead of older, I grew younger.
Whoever thinks this possible will be happy for the rest of his life.
Once great snowflakes fell in the castle courtyard.
To live on here until the winter only.
Then when it begins to snow...
Oh...
It can snow upon us so gently... so intensely...
..in such an immense...
..silence.
Neither beginning nor end, everything in a grey-white snowing...
..no more sky, no more air.
No more streets.
Rule the world.
Sometimes more life lies hidden in the opening of a door than in a question.
Past and future circle about us - now we know more...
..now we know less.
To the deer forests.
And what was the institute before it was the institute?
Is life sketching a more subtle sketch than I?
Here they find the things Fräulein Benjamenta teaches us...
..worth knowing.
It isn't much and we are always revising.
But perhaps there is some hidden meaning to all these nothings.
We grasp a thing and it is as if it possessed us.
Not we possess it, but it us.
Sir, I have rescued the cat from the tall tree in the garden.
Be careful, Viscount, the steeple, it is wobbling!
Agh!
Be careful, Viscount, the church steeple, it is wobbling.
Agh!
Be careful...
Your Highness, don't eat the schnitzel. It's...
Agh!
The institute is no place for your vile fantasies,
Duchess.
Please remove your hand from my knee.
Wake up, wake up, Duchess!
There's a fire in the nursery!
Wake up!
Wake up, wake up, Duchess!
There's a fire in the nursery!
I have placed the children in the care of the chief of the fire brigade.
There is no need to worry.
Look, there are only minor burns to my left side.
You go to the children. Forget about me.
Yes, I forgive you for you know not what you do.
I forgive you, Your Highness, for you know not what you do.
Wake up, wake up, Duchess!
There's a fire in the nursery!
Kraus?
He behaves as if he plans staying here for another century.
'Wait for it' is engraved on his skull.
How are you, Jakob? Are you all right?
Have you settled in?
Of course, Fräulein. Thank you.
And you get on with the other students?
I respect them all without exception.
And yet you quarrel with Kraus, no?
Listen to me, Jakob.
God gives a Kraus to this world in order to entrust it with a deep and insoluble riddle.
This riddle will never be understood because there isn't a single person alive...
..who will guess that there is some delicate meaning...
..behind this name, this...
..monosyllabic, inconspicuous Kraus.
No-one will ever be grateful to Kraus, nor is gratitude necessary.
Kraus will never go to ruin because there will always be great and loveless difficulties confronting him.
I think that I...
I am perhaps the only person who realises what we have in Kraus.
Or have had in him.
Slaap soet.
The way they live here with us students...
Are these the inner chambers?
Will I ever reach them?
Nameless...
..monosyllabic...
..inconspicuous...
..Kraus.
Tell me, don't you find life here...
..sterile?
Sterile, huh?
My mind is dying.
Forgive me for speaking so...
..intimately...
..for being so weak.
You are probably secretly laughing at me.
But watch out!
See that wall?
I could throw you against it so hard, you would never see or hear anything again.
But don't be afraid.
I couldn't hurt you.
It's so nice to talk with you.
Like we are almost related.
The way you speak... your gestures...
..your mouth...
..everything.
It's delightful to behave in that... rather weak sort of way with you.
Just think... me... your master...
..confessing to you.
My pathetic little worm...
..whom I could utterly crush... if I chose to.
Give me your hand.
Good.
I have to tell you... you've gained my respect...
..and now...
..I have a request.
Would you...?
Will you be my confidante?
Someone to share all of my secrets.
I'm asking you...Jakob.
But you may have time to think it over.
Please. Go.
Go now, Jakob.
It's time.
Kwart oor drie.
The same thing.
Over and over again.
Glaub mir, Lisa. Wirklich.
The moment I clapped my eyes on this figure,
I realised it was Jesus...
..as large as life, standing in front of me.
So...he wasn't dead.
He was right there before me in the snow...
..tenderly...beckoning to me.
And with his celestial but shy eyes all aglow, full of wondrous...
..terrible light.
I threw my entire being into the apparition.
And I asked myself, 'What's Jesus up to, here, on the edge of the city?
Is there really anything for him to do in this world, to concern himself with?
And if yes, what would be the most likely way he'd choose to...
..make himself known to us?'
And what do you think...
And a nice, big zero for you.
Look.
The sun.
Our plant.
How beautiful!
Johannes, it's 1:15.
It always strikes our planet at this time.
- Plant, I said.
- Yes, planet.
Why are there no longer any real seasons here?
Johannes, we never speak any more.
Lisa...
People... who know each other as well as we do...
..don't need to make small talk.
Who know each other as well as we do?
Brother and sister, I mean.
Snow White...
..waiting for life to stir her.
Lisa...
Lisa?
Dead.
To be nothing more than dead and smiling.
How I hurt beneath this sun.
I, who have never known the hot gusts of life.
Lisa...
Lisa...
I hadn't heard the Fräulein come in.
She laid her hand on my shoulder, as if she were weary and needed support.
I almost felt as though I belonged to her then.
Come with me, Jakob.
I want to show you something.
Oh, how beautiful it is here, Jakob. lf only you could see it.
But you mustn't.
That is not for you.
But you may feel.
The ice, Jakob.
How it waits.
How patiently it waits and grows.
Kiss it, Jakob.
Kiss the ice.
It is I, your teacher, Lisa Benjamenta, who asks you.
Don't let it steal your breath away!
That taste is your blood.
Come away.
There is warmth, Jakob.
You can find warmth.
Look for it, Jakob.
Look for it.
Is your heart on fire? Yes.
It burns.
But can it hold back the ice?
It's still there, Jakob. The ice.
It's still waiting.
I can't feel you, Jakob!
I can't feel you.
Suddenly, I was back, sitting at my desk.
Fräulein Benjamenta was still standing behind me.
She stroked my cheeks.
But it was as if she were comforting herself, not me.
Am I living in a fairy tale?
Am I living in a fairy tale?
Yours, so shyly.
So shyly.
Yours...
My young saplings...sap... lf only...
I could be with...
..my dwarves.
My young saplings.
Saplings.
If only I could be with...saplings...
Paying attention...you're not...
Saplings...pay attention...
My young saplings.
Saplings.
My young saplings...
You're not paying attention.
I refer you to your manual.
The chapter headed The Divine Duty of Servants.
The section entitled...
Snares and Temptations...
..which is...
Can you hear me?
..which is...
Repeat after me.
Sobering, succinct...
..salutary advice...
..for those about to commit the sin of thinking themselves above their station.
This phenomenon is known as...
Pepino!
Hebling...
Inigo...
Inigo! Inigo!
Inigo!
This phenomenon is known as...
How everything is changing here.
No new students are enrolling at the institute.
Everything has become so...
..fragile.
Often the Fräulein stares out of the window, as if she were already living somewhere else.
Yet the lessons continue.
We're still caught in the grip of the rules and indulge in monotonous repetitions.
I've finally been inside the inner chambers...
..and I have to say...
..they don't exist.
Instead of a mystery, there's only a goldfish.
And Kraus has taught me how to clean out its bowl...
..change its water...
..and feed it.
Fräulein Lisa said something very strange to me.
'Jakob,' she said...
Jakob...
This must be for your ears only.
Something is gnawing at me.
Like this.
See how I am breathing on you?
That is how he's breathing his cold breath on me...
..from behind.
I'm sinking...
My breath is being crushed from me.
I am dying from...
..those who could have seen and held me.
I'm dying from...
..the emptiness of cautious and clever people.
Enough.
Now you must forget about all of this.
No-one must know.
Especially not my brother.
To be allowed to obey her...
As long as I obey her, she will live.
Whatever is forbidden lives...
..a hundred times over.
Herr Benjamenta...
Jakob von Gunten here.
You summoned me?
..or something very... delicate.
You see, Jakob... how I know the words by heart?
Because... it is my heart that speaks them.
Jakob...
Couldn't we...
Could we try, you and l...
The low and the mighty.
Could we just try to stand up to life together?
Shoulder to shoulder.
Side by side.
But Herr Benjamenta...
You are my principal.
This place is finished. Don't you understand?
I'm not accepting any more students. You were the last one.
You thought...
..the...Institut Benjamenta...
..was one of those places here today... and gone tomorrow?
It's you.
You are the one.
It's...all happened since you came.
Who are you?
Oh, Jesus...
Goodbye, Jakob.
Kiss me, Jakob.
Just once.
Be soft.
Shhh-shhh.
Enough.
No despair.
Everything is good just the way it is.
It's beautiful, isn't it...
..not to want anything any more?
From now on, it can only be evening in this world.
And all about me. lmagine me...coming for you.
Surely... the King is dead.
Twice over.
Jakob...
Jakob, I'm so...lonely.
Herr Benjamenta...
Sleep. Rest sweetly, dear Fräulein.
The Fräulein lay there lifeless, just as she told me she would.
Her eyes were still open. Not very wide...
..but as if she was still smiling.
And it seemed to me that she must live for eternity...
..only to be for eternity no living being.
The sound of thy voice shall live on.
We withdrew, leaving the brother with the sister.
The Principal with the Principaless.
The lonely man with the lonely woman.
The living person with the dead one.
I shall surely go on living, but what will become of you?
Do something.
Look behind the curtain...Jakob.
Look behind the curtain.
She may be hiding here.
Once...
..I was crowned with success.
The world smiled on me.
But I hated the world.
Hated existing.
Hated those I taught to take orders.
Hated myself for loving to give orders.
Everything.
I hated it all.
But no longer.
Now...
..that I'm not a king...
Now...
..I want to live.
I'm hungry for life!
Jakob...
Everyone has gone. Even Kraus.
I've pronounced the institute dead.
We are free.
Jakob...
Come with me.
Follow me...
..out of this world...
..for ever.
And it will snow upon us so intensely...
..in such immense silence.
Neither beginning nor end.
Everything in a grey, white...snowing.
No more sky.
No more air.
In us the sound of thy voice shall live on.
Follow me to a place where incredible feats
Are routine every hour or so
Where enchantment runs rampant
Yes, wild in the streets
Open sesame, here we go!
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
They tease and excite
Take off and take flight
They shock and amaze
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Pack your shield, pack your sword
You won't ever get bored
Though get beaten or gored you might
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night
Arabian night
This night has been quite rewarding.
We have never stolen so much.
We have gathered much loot tonight.
No thanks to our leader.
Well, it only looked expensive.
Is this a haul or what, my surly band of desert skunks?
How is it you get the jeweled flower, Abis Mal?
Why, this is my bonus for being your beloved leader.
This and that and that are my beloved leader bonus.
And what is our reward?
Hmm?
Here you go. Good work, boys.
Very successful raid.
- The chest!
- It moves!
- It cannot be!
- What is holding it up?
Ghosts!
Hello.
You stupid monkey!
Put him down, Abis Mal!
Who are you?
My friends call me Al.
You can call me Aladdin.
Hurt him!
- What?
- Where did he go?
- There!
- He has our loot!
Don't let him get away!
- He must not escape!
- Stop him!
- Why, you...
- Hey!
He's getting away!
- There he is!
- We've got him now!
A flying carpet?
He's got a flying carpet!
Nice catch, Carpet.
Hey!
Pardon me!
Yeah!
Come back here!
That's mine! Whoa!
Next stop, Agrabah.
- Shut the door!
- He's escaping!
Finally!
This is terrific!
I got sand in places
I didn't even know I had.
Spare me your prattling, Iago!
Are we out yet?
"Are we out yet? Are we out yet?"
Yes, we're out! No thanks to you.
If it weren't for me... you'd be stuck down there forever.
Iago!
You will now release me... so that I may have my revenge.
Yeah, yeah, when I'm good and ready.
Do as I say, you worthless pipsqueak!
You know something?
You're nothing without me.
What?
Who comes up with all the good ideas? Me!
Who does all the work? Me!
If it weren't for me... you still be in a cage at the bazaar... squawking, "Polly want a cracker!"
That's it, I've had it
I hate to be dramatic
But it's time for me to fly the coop
Terrific, fine
I'm drawing the line
Before I wind up in a parrot soup
I was a fool to let you run the show
I'm cuttin' you loose, pal
Look out below
Arrividerci, c'est la vie
Hope all goes well
I'm lookin' out for me
Agrabah... just a juicy golden goose ready for plucking... and I'm the one holdin' the tweezers!
I'll be runnin' this town inside a week!
What's your problem, liver lips?
You don't think I can do it?
OK, I'm little
Been playin' second fiddle
And I don't get no respect
I turn the other cheek
But this busted beak
Is the only thanks that I get
I never found a friend that I can trust
They promise caviar and leave me eating dust
That's some reward for loyalty
From here on in
I'm lookin' out for me
Ohh, I don't need nobody else
I'll never fail
I'll cover my own tail
I can take care of myself
You know, it just don't pay to give a hoot
I've given all my heart
What do I get? The boot
I'm through with that
I'm flappin' free
From here on in
I'm lookin' out for me
Steal from us again... and your scrawny body will be dinner for the jackals!
Sure. No problem.
Huh?
No! No!
- Abu!
- No!
We're not the ones who need this money.
A miracle.
Rain on me!
Gold from the heavens!
Don't worry, Abu.
I'm not throwing everything.
Yes!
This is for Jasmine.
No!
Whoa!
Uh-oh.
Easy, Rajah. You know me. Aladdin?
OK, Rajah, OK.
I'm glad to see you, too.
How do I look?
- I think you look fine.
- Jasmine!
Where were you? I missed you.
I had to pick up a few things.
This is for you.
Oh, Aladdin! It's lovely!
"It's lovely."
It must have cost a fortune.
Oh, no, it was a steal.
Father wants you to join us for dinner tonight.
He's going to make a royal announcement.
And he wants me there?
It's about you.
Am I in trouble?
Let's just say... this is a dinner you don't want to miss.
Jasmine, what's going on?
I promised Father
I wouldn't spoil his surprise.
You've made quite an impression, you know.
So I'm not in trouble?
Of course not.
You defeated Jafar, saved Agrabah... and rescued a princess.
Aladdin, you are a hero.
Yeah, I guess so.
That's me. Ready for anything!
Abu!
You may want to change before dinner, though.
Seems like only yesterday
Jafar was runnin' Agrabah.
And I was his right-hand bird.
But then he had to go and mess things up!
Now I'm stuck on the outside looking in.
I gotta get back into the palace!
Back into power!
Well, my dear Abu... shall we see what the common folk are doing today?
Let's go!
We have time for a stroll before our audience with the sultan.
The street rat is living in the palace now?
That does it! All reports are in!
Life is now officially unfair!
Wait! Wait a second here!
This is perfect!
That kid is my ticket back into power.
I'll just get Aladdin on my side with a little sympathy act.
Then I'll be back in the palace again... quicker than you can say "Easy Street."
- Aladdin!
- Huh?
Kid... finally... got free... of... Jafar.
Iago! What are you doing here?
Where are you? Getting dark...
Hold me...
Hey, I meant gentle-like!
You're not fooling anyone!
No, wait, I'm serious!
I was under Jafar's power!
He mesmerized me with his snake staff!
Just like the sultan.
You traitor, you!
You look familiar.
It's Aladdin.
Where? It is? I knew that!
Hurt him a lot!
Hurt him and his monkey and his bird, too!
Uh-oh.
Treacherous parrot!
Look, I'm not with him!
Monkey, help! They're after me!
You won't dance out of this one!
That's it! Now I'm mad!
Mess with this bird, huh?
Huh?
And I got more where that came from!
My eggs... ruined!
Who will pay for them?
Oh, go away.
Guards! Guards!
What is the trouble here?
It is that thief Abis Mal!
Whoa!
After them!
Jerks.
Thanks for your help. You saved me.
I did? Right! Oh, yeah!
Of course I saved you! It's my nature.
I'm always rescuing things.
Cats, babies, guys like you, always rescuing.
Hey, what's going on?
Is this any way to treat your rescuer?
You owe me, pal! I saved your life!
Abu, wait!
He's right. I do owe him.
Huh?
I'll see that the sultan gives him a fair hearing.
What? The sultan?
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.
Soften him up a little.
Are you kidding? He hates me!
And what about the princess?
Hmm? No problem.
I just have to make sure that Jasmine doesn't see you... until I've gotten her prepared.
Gotten me prepared for what?
I mean... for the... for the stain...
Abu got on the brand new vest you gave him.
I did not!
I don't see a stain.
Well, no problem, then. Off to dinner.
Can't wait for that surprise.
- Is something wrong?
- Huh? Wrong? Oh, come on!
No, no, no, everything's just fine.
You aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Any more secrets?
Secrets?
Of course not!
I almost lost you once that way.
I'll never make that mistake again.
What?
He's big and he's blue and he's back!
- Genie!
- You came back!
Watch the sunburn!
A-ha! Kidding!
Did you miss me? Be honest.
Take care of these, my good mammal.
Whoa!
Careful, they're heavy!
Hang on, I got souvenirs for everybody!
She dances!
You saw the whole world already?
It's a small world after all
But Agrabah has something... that no other place in the world has.
You guys!
I parachuted down into the Taj Mahal
I Rollerbladed all along the great Great Wall
I even made the famous leaning tower fall
But who was with me through it all?
Nobody
The Moscow Circus hired me to fly trapeze
On Mount Olympus, won a race with Hercules
It's easy when you're chased by killer bees
Who said "Gesundheit" when I sneezed?
So now I'm home
Home again with you
You chase the clouds away
Whenever I am blue
You're always blue.
Land of the pyramids
I highly recommend
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend
Slept like a babe in Bombay on a bed of nails
Moroccans loved my daring Dance of Seven Veils
Why, single-handedly,
I even saved the whales
No one was there to hear my tales
In Acapulco, joined a mariachi band
I rode the raging rapids down the Rio Grande
Flew in an air balloon, but when I tried to land
Nobody laughed or lent a hand
Without you, the Amazon is just a trickle
Without you, the Sahara's not so hot
Without you, Niagara Falls is just a leaky faucet
The QE2 is just some yacht
Now that I'm home
Home again, it's clear
All I ever wanted
Seems to be right here
I've traveled east and west
And now I'm back again
And there's nothing in the world
Quite like a friend
There's nothing in the world
Nothing in the whole wide world
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend
Nothing in the whole wide world
So, Genie, how does it feel to be free?
Seriously? I love it!
OK, maybe my powers aren't what they used to be.
Let's say they're semi-phenomenal... nearly cosmic, but don't sell me short.
I may be free, but I still have some magic in me.
I can still do this!
Hey!
Hate to lose face in front of you guys.
Give me another chance.
Who's first? I can do this!
- Genie, we have to go to...
- Dinner! We're late!
You probably have a romantic dinner for two planned.
You don't need a big blue lug gumming up the works.
- But, Genie...
- Three's a crowd.
You kids go on.
Genie, I would be honored if you'd join us for dinner.
You would?
Come on, everyone! Get in here!
Home cookin'? Let's go!
Oh, boy!
Not you, Abu.
You have a job to do, remember?
- Huh?
- You have to guard Iago!
Giddy-up, slow-poke. What's keepin' ya?
Nothing!
Well, something, but I'll tell you later.
That stinking Aladdin.
First chance I get,
I'll slice him in half.
That stinking Abis Mal.
First chance we get, let's slice him in half.
Hey, get over here and wash up!
It's bad enough I have to look at you... without having to smell you.
Come, we do it now. No witnesses.
What is this? So help me,
I'll sue whoever runs this well.
A lamp. Well, well, it might be worth... a few shekels once it's cleaned up.
It will be of little use to you, Abis Mal!
Except to light your way to the Valley of the Dead!
It is bewitched!
I am free!
Free to exact vengeance upon he who has imprisoned me!
It is the curse of the lamp.
All the power in the universe... and I am bound by the rules of the genie!
Which means I can't kill that upstart Aladdin!
Unless I have someone arrange it for me.
Take me to Agrabah at once!
I suppose I am a bit too much for his limited mind.
I trust you'll find me a little less overwhelming now?
You're... a genie?
You are astonishingly perceptive.
If you're a genie, then don't I get wishes?
Yes, three wishes.
That is a minor formality.
But, first, I must go to Agrabah.
You will take the lamp there for me.
Then... you need me.
I'll take you to Agrabah... but, first, I want my wishes.
Why, you...
You shall have your wishes.
I shall? I mean, of course I shall!
Oh, I want... I want riches, treasure!
Let's see, I know...
I wish for the legendary sunken treasure ship... of Coeur Du Mer!
Your wish is my command.
Poor sweet baby.
Aren't we enjoying our wish?
Perhaps you wish me to return you to the desert?
Yes!
Very well.
That was two wishes.
Take your time with the third.
Or you will wish you had never been born.
On the other hand, if you cooperate with me...
I will see that you are amply rewarded.
Rewarded?
First, you will help me get revenge... on a certain street rat by the name of... Aladdin.
Aladdin?
I want revenge on him, too!
He robbed me, turned my men against me... and he fought dirty!
My brilliant swordsmanship availed me nought!
I hate when I do that.
Let's not be too hasty, my simple-minded friend.
It's not enough that we simply destroy Aladdin.
After all, there are things so much worse than death.
OK, prepare yourselves for a real culinary treat.
Oh-ho-ho-ho, my!
Whoopsie.
Most amusing!
Amusing, right.
Excuse me while I pull myself together.
Absolutely delightful!
Now, to business.
Aladdin, you have proven to be a man... of strong moral character.
That is why I've decided to make you... my new royal vizier.
Me? Really?
Isn't it wonderful?
Wow! Royal vizier!
Aladdin would like to thank the Academy... for this great honor!
You want 'em? We got 'em!
Royal vizier t-shirts!
All hail Aladdin, the royal vizier!
So, what's a royal vizier?
Well... he will be my most trusted advisor.
Well, that makes sense.
He's bound to be better than that Jafar character.
Quite so!
And Iago... talk about a rat with wings!
- Genie?
- That bird was mean!
Sultan want a cracker? Remember that?
I can still taste them! The traitor!
Yes, sir! You don't see this guy... hanging out with any evil parrots!
It's funny you should mention Iago.
Oh, monkey!
Come on! Monkey, little birdie want to talk to monkey.
Have nice banana.
Birdie get monkey a pretty banana... if monkey open cage. Yum yum!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on! I've got a wife and three eggs!
Imagine them hatching, never knowing their daddy!
Come on, open the cage!
Open it! Open it! Open it!
Yeah, that's more like it.
Close the cage!
Close it! Close it! Close it!
Uh-oh!
Your monkey's trying to kill me!
I saved your life!
It's payback time, Aladdin!
Whoa!
Aladdin!
Rajah! You know better... than to tear around the palace like that!
Help! Hey!
So, Aladdin... why did you bring up that deceitful parrot?
Sultan, I have to tell you something about Iago.
He's here.
Iago! Guards!
- No, wait!
- Get that bird!
Yes, Your Highness.
It would be my pleasure.
No, Sultan! No!
Move out of my way, boy!
You don't understand! Just listen!
- I have a...
- Your Highness!
I trust he has a fitting explanation... for this... this scandal?
He had better.
Your Highness, I think Iago was...
Mesmerized.
Yeah, yeah! He was under Jafar's spell.
Remember the snake staff?
Iago was only... Look, I just...
Iago's not all that bad.
At least I don't think so anyway.
Shoulda stuck with the snake staff defense.
"Not all bad"?
He only served my greatest enemy, that's all!
We can't allow that traitorous bird to run free!
Then I'll watch him!
You Highness, I meant, with your permission...
I'd like to take full responsibility for Iago.
You would?
Your priorities seem questionable to me... but so be it.
Aladdin, you will watch
Iago every moment.
And if the bird makes one wrong move... you shall be the one I pluck, boy.
That could've gone worse.
Oh, Jasmine, I thought I was sunk.
Not good!
You were hiding Iago all along, weren't you?
I think it just got worse.
Well, yes, but...
How could you? More secrets? More lies?
Aladdin, I thought you had changed.
Jasmine, wait!
Back in the marketplace...
Iago... he... he saved my life.
Some grand vizier I'm gonna make.
Everybody's mad at me.
Hey, Jasmine's just a little steamed.
She'll cool down. Care for a cup?
This isn't cheering you up, is it?
I don't get it, Genie.
I try to do something good and it blows up in my face!
That's the problem with doing the right thing.
Sometimes you do it by yourself.
That kid saved my life.
Nobody's ever looked out for me before.
Now, it's like I owe him.
Nah!
Just let your conscience be your guide.
Conscience? Never had one. Never.
What are you trying to do, give me a heart attack?
A-ha! You do have a heart!
An itty-bitty one, but it is there.
Can you quit with the hocus pocus already?
Look at him.
Would it kill you to do something nice for him?
Possibly. I don't do "nice."
Oh, come on! It’ll be fun!
I don't do fun, either!
We have to get Al and the princess back together!
Look, I definitely don't do mushy stuff!
It's not me!
I know, but it's going to be tricky.
Tricky is good.
Tricky I can do.
Come on, Princess!
Don't waste your tears on him.
You! You get out of here!
Hey, don't take it out on me!
He's the creep.
I never should have saved his life.
Saved his life?
Yeah. He owed me one.
That's why he stood up for me.
But he didn't have to lie to me.
You are so right.
Forget about that guy
Forget about the way you fell into his eyes
Forget about his charms
Forget about the way he held you in his arms
Walking on air's obnoxious
The thrills, the chills
Will make you nauseous
And you'll never get enough
Just forget about love
She's buying it!
Now make with the magic!
Forget about romance
Forget about the way your heart begins to dance
Then you feel the blush
When he's spouting out some sentimental mush
Love really is revolting
It's even worse than when you're molting
Enough of this fluff
Just forget about love
I had almost forgotten the way it felt
When he held out his hand for mine
My heart all a-flutter
Oh, how I shudder
The first time we kissed
It won't be missed
Forget about his touch
I can't forget about his touch
In the scheme of things it doesn't matter much
It matters so much
You're better on your own
A meal becomes a banquet when you eat alone
Love's filled with compromises
And don't you hate those big surprises
A cozy rendezvous
Oh, please
Candlelight for two
Oh, jeez
Look, you're calling my bluff
- I can't forget about love
- Just forget about love
Jasmine, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have kept
Iago a secret. Please...
Aladdin, you don't have to...
I can't forget about my heart
And how it felt to fall for you right from the start
I'm still falling
Whatever we may do
You are here for me and I'll be there for you
I'll be there
To wish, to want, to wander
To find the sun through rain and thunder
A cozy rendezvous
Yes, please
Candlelight for two
Oh, jeez
Enough is enough
We can't forget about love
We did it! We're in!
It's about time. It was getting hot.
How very like Iago.
He's lost no time endearing himself to those in power.
Which fits in perfectly with my plan.
I'm sorry, Jasmine.
Ahh, love.
Don't mind us.
Yeah, well, this is kind of a special moment.
Right. Got it. Say no more.
Enough said. Roger. Over and out.
Rolling!
Today's special moments are tomorrow's memories.
Looking great, Jas. More emotion, Al.
Tilt your chin a bit.
What does he have to do... to make it clear to you lunkheads?
The show's over. They want to be alone!
Break it up!
Are you sure about him?
Move it, primate! Shoo! Go on!
That takes care of the peanut gallery.
If you need me...
I'll be lazing about in the lap of luxury.
I'm sure about this.
Ohh, yeah!
Being one of the good guys has its advantages.
Advisor to Aladdin... the new grand vizier.
And when Aladdin becomes sultan... that will make me the grand vizier.
Only I'm not gonna blow it like that idiot Jafar.
I'll never have to stand in his shadow again.
Jafar!
Buddy?
A funny thing happened.
You see, this guy took the lamp.
You probably thought it was me...
'cause it sounded a lot like me... but a lot of people sound like me.
Anyway, he took the lamp and...
Calm yourself, Iago.
I haven't come for revenge against you.
So that's good to hear.
I got it! I could wish for... the famed treasure chest of King Malakhan!
I am dreadfully sorry.
I thought that was your wish.
Are you quite all right?
No, I am not quite...
Wonderful. Good to see all is well.
Abis Mal here is my new friend... and I couldn't help noticing... that you've made some new friends, too.
Like... Aladdin.
Friend? Friend is such a strong word.
He's more like an acquaintance.
I'm arranging a little surprise for Aladdin... and your job is to lead him to the party.
You know, I don't think
I'm the guy for this job.
You know, you should talk to... the monkey!
Yeah! The monkey's really got
Aladdin's ear!
No, Iago... you!
You know, Aladdin... AI... here's an idea.
I was just thinking...
Focus... focus.
Focus... focus... focus... focus...
Aiming... and...
Shoot!
Sorry, little feathered friend.
I'll get that out.
It's stuck good.
Cueball-ectomy! Nurse!
Abu! Iago here's our friend now.
We can trust him.
Now, let's get that ball... out of his beak. What do you say?
OK.
Brilliant, Nurse Heimlich!
Thanks... Bobo.
- It's Abu.
- Whatever.
That's the spirit!
We're all one big family now!
Yeah, sure. Family.
Oh, brother.
Yeah, well, I gotta find Al.
Your shot.
Pool's a man's game... so being a rug, you'll be at a disadvan...
Pool's a dumb game anyway.
I can't explain it, Jasmine.
I think we can trust Iago.
Well... then I guess
I can give him a chance.
Iago?
I... I was just thinking.
Maybe it's time you patched things up with the sultan.
He might enjoy... a nice scenic carpet ride?
- That's a good idea.
- And I'll bring Genie.
He was a big hit with the sultan.
No, no, no!
I mean, Genie's... he's too flashy!
He's too loud!
You'll never get a word in.
Good point, Iago.
You need some quiet time with Father.
Let him get to know you.
Yeah! And I...
I can take you to the perfect spot.
- Great!
- Come on, let's get Father.
Just a minute.
Iago? This isn't easy for me to say... but I was wrong about you.
Wait a second!
Yes, Iago?
I'll be along in a minute.
Excellent.
Give them a chance, Father.
Oh, I'll try, dearest.
After you, Your Highness.
All right, Carpet, let's go!
- Whoopee!
- Have a good time!
Hey, hey! Clear the way!
Make room for the picnic boys!
They already left, Genie.
Without us?
Without us?
No problem! I'll catch up in a flash!
Wait! Without me, too!
Aladdin needs some time alone with Father to patch things up.
You know what this means, monkey boy?
More food for us!
Oh, boy!
I'm sorry. Did you want some?
I'm... not hungry just now.
You two go ahead.
Come on, my boy!
Show me what this thing can really do!
That's the spot!
On top of the waterfall!
I'm losing my feathers here!
You're lucky you haven't lost more than that!
Oh, what fun!
Iago, I have to hand it to you.
This is a nice place.
It doesn't get any better than this, eh, Shaggy?
How about a nice drumstick?
This could use some secret herbs and spices.
Spiders?
Things could get ugly!
- Jafar!
- Uh-oh!
Sorry to spoil your picnic, boys... but I can't have any genies mucking about... ruining my plans.
Don't worry, Abu.
He's a genie, and genies can't kill anyone.
But you'd be surprised what you can live through.
You always were good for a laugh.
Oh, yeah?
Who's laughing now?
Why, I believe it's me.
I must admit
Your parlor tricks are amusing
I bet you've got a bunny under your hat
Now, here's your chance to get the best of me
Hope your hand is hot
Come on, clown, let's see what you've got
You can try to slam me with your hardest stuff
But your double whammy isn't up to snuff
I'll set the record straight
You're simply out of date, you're only second rate
You think your cat's a meanie
But your tiger's tame
You've got a lot to learn about the genie game
So for your education, I'll reiterate
You're only second rate
Men cower at the power in my pinky
My thumb is number one on every list
But if you're not convinced that I'm invincible
Put me to the test
I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest
Go ahead and zap me with the big surprise
Slap me in a trap, cut me down to size
I'll make a great escape, it's just a piece of cake
You're only second rate
You know, your hocus-pocus isn't tough enough
And your mumbo-jumbo doesn't measure up
Let me pontificate upon your sorry state
You're only second rate
Zaba-caba-dabra
Granny's gonna grab ya
Alakazam-Na-bus
This thing's bigger than the both of us
So spare me your tremendous scare
You look horrendous in your underwear
And I can hardly wait to discombobulate
I'll send ya back and packing in a shipping crate
You'll make a better living with a spinning plate
You're only second rate
Hello? Hello?
That was invigorating!
Come, Abis Mal... we have other lives to ruin.
Sultan...
Look, I'm sorry for not telling you about Iago.
I guess I saw some good in him... just like you saw some good in a street rat.
The good I saw in a...
Well, oh, yes, I... I suppose.
Well said, my boy!
Oh, you'll be a fine vizier!
This was a great idea, Iago. Thanks.
Oh, don't thank me. Really.
Sultan!
Abis Mal?
Aladdin!
You traitor!
Traitor is such a strong word.
Aladdin! Help!
I'll settle with you later.
Come on, Carpet!
Look, they're trapped on the cliff!
When they stop, we'll... What?
Abis Mal knows magic?
Whoa!
What? Get him! Get the sultan!
Hang on, Sultan!
This is where we lose them.
Sultan! We have to go back, Carpet!
Yes!
Huh?
What are you doing?
Are you nuts? You saved him!
He was this close... to being a greasy little smear on the rocks!
Look, you little...
I mean, my dear Abis Mal... if you remember the plan... it is not yet time for the boy to meet his end.
I knew that.
Soon, our revenge will be complete... and you shall have your third wish.
Ooh, my little wishy!
And you, Iago!
You have done well.
Please, don't mention it.
Sultan!
Iago.
Jafar, you fiend!
I should have known that this was your treachery!
But I couldn't have done it without Iago.
I played a minor role, really.
Jafar! This rug won't cooperate!
When Aladdin returns...
I think we have ample time to prepare for his arrival.
Hey! That was a nice hat.
I could have worn that hat!
We need this for our plan.
Couldn't we use another hat for the plan?
Oh, no. The sultan's turban and this dagger... are exactly what we need... to seal Aladdin's doom.
Razoul! The sultan's been...
Seize him! You are under arrest... for the murder of the sultan!
What? No!
And then you went over the waterfall, eh?
How did you survive?
I... I don't know.
How very convenient.
It's the truth!
Why won't you believe me?
Because we know you're lying!
- Huh?
- I found this in your room.
My father's turban... slashed!
- You can't think...
- I thought you loved me!
But now I see that all you wanted to do...
- was rule Agrabah!
- I never wanted...
He shall die at dawn for the murder of my father.
Jasmine, please!
You're in my hands now, street rat!
You should have seen the look on Aladdin's face... when Princess Jasmine sentenced him to death.
No!
Oh, yes! And then I get my wish.
Yes, and then you get your wish.
Iago! I swear one day you will pay for this!
I really think you're making too big a deal out of this.
Such spirit!
Perhaps after a few days in chains... you'll be more kindly disposed toward me.
Especially if you want your father to remain healthy!
Ah, Iago... you betrayed me and allied yourself with my enemies.
Then you turned on them... as soon as it was in your best interests.
That's what I love about you.
You're so perfectly predictable.
A villain through and through.
Thank you. Thank you.
Dawn!
I'll tell your boyfriend good-bye for you, Princess.
When I get hold of you, Jafar...
I'm so worried.
How could you double-cross Aladdin... after all he's done for you!
Hey, do I insult your mother?
What are you doing now?
Oh, what does it look like I'm doing?
I'm trying to free the chump genie... so he can save your chump boyfriend!
You have to lift it higher!
Sure. No problem.
- Wait!
- Jasmine!
I knew you wouldn't go through with this.
I just wanted to say good-bye, street rat.
Jafar! It's Jafar...
Thanks for saving me!
Oh, come on, Al. You know I had to.
That no-head look is just not you.
For my next trick, bibbidy bobbidy boo!
Oh-ho, and everybody's safe and sound.
Aladdin!
Aladdin!
Good to see you, too, Abu!
There's somebody else who wants to talk to you.
Hello.
You set me up!
How could you show your face?
You're nothing but a...
Aladdin, Iago rescued us.
He didn't have to, but he did.
Rescued? Him?
Please note...
"Did not have to, but did."
Now we should be fleeing for our lives... if you don't mind!
No! We have to stop Jafar!
But how? He's so powerful!
His lamp.
You destroy Jafar's lamp, you destroy Jafar.
Then that's what we'll do!
Reality check.
Jafar is large and in charge.
Yes. There's no telling what Jafar will do to Agrabah.
We have a responsibility!
Maybe you do, but I don't!
I'm only responsible for me, myself, and nobody!
I understand Iago. You've done enough.
And thanks!
Hey, I did my good deed!
I don't owe you a thing! You hear me!
Not a thing.
Now that my revenge is complete... there is one little matter left to resolve.
Yes! The wish!
Indeed.
You will now wish me free of this wretched lamp!
No! My wish!
You got what you wanted!
Now it's my turn!
But you don't need to waste your third wish.
You want the sunken treasure of Coeur Du Mer?
It's yours!
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes! I love it! I love it!
Silver! Lots and lots of it!
Oh, I'm so excited!
So this means I could have more stuff?
I always wanted one of those!
Nice! More! More!
Oh, dear!
Now, if it's obscenely excessive enough... perhaps you'd care to grant my freedom.
Huh? What? Oh, yeah, right.
Wish you were free. Sure thing, yeah.
I wish for Jafar to be...
Wait... how do I know that these things... won't disappear once I set you free?
The more pressing question is... how will you stay alive if you don't?
But you said genies can't kill!
You said that!
You'd be surprised what you can live through.
What?
Huh? Hey!
I'll take that!
My lamp! Gimme!
The street rat? Still alive? No!
Help!
Thanks, Genie!
Where's the lamp?
Aladdin!
Not so fast!
Give it up, Jafar!
We're obviously too much for you to handle!
You! You're a fool to challenge me!
I am all-powerful!
Some all-powerful.
You can't even get rid of a lowly street rat.
A problem I mean to rectify right now!
Aladdin!
- What?
- Gotcha!
Go, Al!
Genie!
Faster, Carpet!
Carpet, no!
Aladdin!
- Genie, wake up!
- Wake up!
Give it up, boy!
You shall never have my lamp... and there is no one to save you this time.
Hey, Jafar! Shut up!
Iago?
Traitor!
No!
Good help is so hard to find these days.
Isn't it, Aladdin?
My lamp!
Iago!
Oh, boy!
Iago...
No!
But I thought a genie couldn't kill anyone.
You'd be surprised what you can live through.
All right!
- Oh, boy!
- Oh, Iago!
He's alive!
And so the bird lived happily ever after... wallowing in luxury as Aladdin's palace pal.
Now, my dear boy... or should I say, my new vizier?
Oh, say it!
Sultan, I'm very honored, but...
But? What but?
"But" is such a strong word!
Why, I oughta...
I can't be your vizier.
What? Sultan, the boy's talking crazy talk!
Don't listen!
What more do you want?
The world.
Look, personally, I'm with you, kid... but let's take it one step at a time.
I mean... I want to see the world.
I can't just stay in the palace.
There's too much to do, too much to see.
Hey, what about your girlfriend?
Do you think that this lovely princess... is just going to wait around here?
I most certainly will not!
There, you see?
I'm going to see the world, too.
OK, that's it! The madness is spreading!
Crazy talk!
Why do I keep getting hooked up with these warped people?
Shouldn't somebody ask what the brave parrot wants to do?
Does this mean
I don't get my third wish?
Ripped by SkyFury
Excuse me, sir, is there a commode?
Justin!
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.
Justin, you get back here right now!
No, stop!
-No, no! Stop him!
-Go back! Don't climb!
Wait, wait.
Hold on. Easy, little boy.
Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No!
No, no, no! There he goes.
Justin!
I've got him! I've got him!
Outrage in Egypt tonight as it was discovered that the Great Pyramid of Giza had been stolen and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.
There is panic throughout the globe as countries and citizens try to protect their beloved landmarks.
Law enforcement still has no leads, leaving everyone to wonder, which of the world's villains is responsible for this heinous crime?
And where will he strike next?
I'm having a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see
Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!
I'm having a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Despicable me
Morning, Gru!
How you doing?
Hello, Fred.
FYl, your dog has been leaving little bombs all over my yard, and I don't appreciate it.
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.
Unless they're dead.
I'm joking!
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.
Okay. Yeah.
Steamrolling whatever I see
Despicable me
I'm having a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Despicable me
You've got to be pulling on my leg!
Hello!
Cookies for sale.
Go away. I'm not home.
Yes, you are. I heard you.
No, you didn't. This is a recording.
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.
Watch this. Leave a message, beep.
Goodbye, recorded message.
Agnes, come on.
Kyle!
Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin.
Gru!
Dr Nefario.
I know how you must be feeling.
I, too, have encountered great disappointment, but in my eyes, you will always be one of the greats.
What? What happened?
It's all over the news!
Some fella just stole a pyramid.
They're saying he makes all other villains look lame.
Assemble the minions!
Minions, assemble!
Okay. Okay.
Hey!
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?
All right.
That's my Billy boy! What up, Larry?
Hello, everybody!
Yeah, all right!
Simmer down. Simmer down!
Thank you, okay.
Now, I realise that you guys probably heard about this other villain who stole the pyramids.
Apparently, it's a big deal.
People are calling it the crime of the century and stuff like that.
But am I upset? No, I am not!
A little, but we have had a pretty good year ourselves, and you guys are all right in my book.
No, no raises!
You're not going to get any raises.
What did we do?
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!
Nice!
That's how I roll.
Yeah, you all like watching football on that, huh?
But that's not all.
We stole the Statue of Liberty, the small one from Las Vegas.
And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower!
Also Vegas.
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you about this yet, but I have been working on something very big!
Something that will blow this pyramid thing out of the water!
And thanks to the efforts of my good friend Dr Nefario...
Thank you!
There he is.
He's styling.
Now, we have located a shrink ray in a secret lab, and once we take this shrink ray, we will have the capability to pull off the true crime of the century.
We are going to steal...
Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.
Hey.
Dave, listen up, please.
Next, we are going to steal, pause for effect, the moon!
And once the moon is mine, the world will give me whatever I want to get it back!
And I will be the greatest villain of all time!
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes?
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers, and I really don't see how we can afford this.
It can't be done. I'm not a miracle worker.
Hey, chillax.
I'll just get another loan from the bank.
They love me!
Edith, stop it!
What? I'm just walking.
-Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
-Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
Hello, girls!
Anybody come to adopt us while we were out?
Let me think.
No!
Edith! What did you put on my desk?
A mud pie.
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?
-Yeah, I know.
-Good.
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?
Sort of.
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies, and 18 coco-nutties.
Okay.
Well, you say that like it's a great sale day.
Look at my face!
Do you still think it's a great sale day?
Eighteen coco-nutties.
I think we can do a little better than that, don't you?
Yeah.
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend in the Box of Shame, would we? No.
-No, Miss Hattie.
-No, Miss Hattie.
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.
-Hi, Penny.
-Hi, Penny.
Hi, guys.
Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...
I just wanted to congratulate you on stealing the pyramid.
That was you, wasn't it?
Or was it a villain who's actually successful?
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something that's very, very big, very important.
When you hear about it, you're going to be very proud.
Good luck with that. Okay, I'm out of here.
Gru to see Mr Perkins.
Yes, please have a seat.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.
NASA isn't sending the monkeys any more.
Hey.
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.
It's a mathematical term, a quantity represented by an arrow, with both direction and magnitude.
Vector! That's me,
'cause I'm committing crimes with both direction and magnitude.
Oh, yeah!
Check out my new weapon.
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!
Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.
Do you want a demonstration?
Shoot! So difficult, sometimes, to get the piranha back inside of my...
Mr Gru, Mr Perkins will see you now.
So, all I need is money from the bank to build a rocket.
-And then, the moon is ours.
-Wow!
Well, very nice presentation.
I'd like to see this shrink ray.
Absolutely! Will do. Soon as I have it.
You don't have it?
And yet you have the audacity to ask the bank for money?
Apparently.
Do you have any idea of the capital that this bank has invested in you, Gru?
With far too few of your sinister plots actually turning a profit.
How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you.
If we don't start getting our money back...
Get the picture?
Look, Gru, the point is, there are a lot of new villains out there, younger than you, hungrier than you, younger than you.
Like that young fellow out there named Vector.
He just stole a pyramid!
I've got it. I've got it.
So, as far as getting money for the rocket...
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.
Suckers!
Suckers!
We got it!
What?
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!
No, no, no!
You!
Now, maybe you'll think twice before you freeze someone's head!
So long, Gru!
Quick! We can't let him get away!
Up ahead! Up ahead!
Fire! Fire, now!
You missed me!
Come to papa!
Take that.
How adorable.
Got you in our sights!
Like taking candy from a...
What?
Hey, Gru!
Try this on for size!
That's weird. What is going...
This is claustrophobic!
No, no, no!
Too small! This is too small for me!
I hate that guy!
...and please watch over us, and bless that we'll have a good night's sleep.
And bless that while we're sleeping, no bugs will crawl into our ears and lay eggs in our brains.
Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.
And please bless that someone will adopt us soon, and that the mommy and daddy will be nice and have a pet unicorn.
Amen.
-Amen.
-Amen.
Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them
Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them
Uni, unicorns, I could pet one
If they were really real
And they are
So, I bought one so I could pet it
Now it loves me
Now I love it
Don't you... What the...
Good luck, little girls!
Whoa! Cool.
Hi! We're orphans from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.
-I don't care. Beat it!
-Come on!
We're selling cookies so, you know, we can have a better future.
-Wait, wait! Do you have coco-nutties?
-Yeah.
Light bulb.
Dr Nefario!
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots disguised as cookies!
-What?
-Cookie robots!
-Who is this?
-Oh, forget it.
Well, it appears you have cleared our background check,
Dr Gru.
And I see you have made a list of some of your personal achievements.
Thank you for that. I love reading.
And I see you have been given the Medal of Honor and a knighthood.
-Me, me, me.
-Me, me, me.
Kevin?
You had your own cooking show and you can hold your breath for 30 seconds?
It's not that impressive.
Idiot!
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
What in the name of... What?
Well, here's the dealio.
Things have been so lonely since my wife,
Debbie, passed on.
It's like my heart is a tooth, and it's got a cavity that can only be filled with children.
I'm sorry.
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?
Do I look like I speak Spanish?
You have a face como un burro.
Well, thank you!
Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption?
So, so excited!
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes to come to the lobby.
I bet the mom is beautiful!
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.
I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.
I'm just saying it'd be nice.
My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly.
That's a Cheeto.
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.
Who's Debbie?
Your wife.
Hi, girls!
Girls, I want you to meet Mr Gru.
He's going to adopt you.
And he's a dentist!
Yeah!
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.
And that's Agnes.
I got your leg, I got your leg!
Okay, that is enough, little girl.
-Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it.
-Higher!
-Higher!
-Just release your grip. Wow!
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?
Some nonstick spray?
Crowbar?
Okay, girls, let's go.
Oh, yeah!
Pretty impressive!
What are you looking at?
Boo-ya!
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!
Take that!
You done been shrunk!
Yello?
I got the shrink ray, all right.
No, I'm not playing with it.
Gru?
Don't make me laugh! No.
P.S., he is not getting the moon, and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him, he's gonna be begging for mercy.
Okay, bye.
Look at you, a little tiny toilet for a little tiny baby...
Curse you, tiny toilet!
Okay, here we are.
Home sweet home.
So, this is, like, your house?
Wait a sec...
You're the guy who pretended he was a recorded message!
No, that was someone else.
Can I hold your hand?
No.
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.
No, hey!
Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests.
Girls, this is Kyle, my dog.
Fluffy doggy!
What kind of dog is that?
He is a... I don't know.
Do you really think that this is an appropriate place for little kids?
'Cause it's not.
No! No! Stay away from there!
It's fragile.
Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.
Hey! It's dark in here.
It poked a hole in my juice box.
As you can see,
I have provided everything a child might need.
All right.
Okay. As I was saying... Hey!
Somebody broke that.
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.
Rule number one.
You will not touch anything.
What about the floor?
Yes, you may touch the floor.
What about the air?
Yes, you may touch the air!
What about this?
-Where did you get that?
-Found it.
Okay. Rule number two.
You will not bother me while I'm working.
Rule number three.
You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle or sneeze or burp or fart!
So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?
Does this count as annoying?
Very!
I will see you in six hours.
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?
Question. What are these?
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!
Look at this. Watch me!
Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.
Why are you so old?
Okay. I'm on it.
Hello?
TV!
What is that?
-Look at that!
-That is cool!
Come on!
I don't think he's a dentist.
We've been working on this for a while.
It's a anti-gravity serum.
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.
-Do the effects wear off?
-So far, no. No, they don't.
And here, of course, is the new weapon you ordered.
No, no.
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering under what circumstances would we use this?
But, anyway.
What I really wanted to show you was this.
Now those are cookie robots!
La, la, la, la
I love unicorns
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!
We got bored. What is this place?
Can I drink this?
Do you want to explode?
Gru!
Get back in the kitchen!
-Will you play with us?
-No.
-Why?
-Because I'm busy.
Doing what?
Okay, okay, you got me.
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.
In real life, I am a spy.
And it is top secret, and you may not tell anybody,
-because if you do...
-What does this do?
Hey!
My unicorn!
You have to fix it.
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.
By definition, it cannot be fixed.
That's freaking me out. What is she doing?
She's gonna hold her breath until she gets a new one.
It is just a toy. Now stop it!
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!
Tim! Mark! Phil!
This is very important.
You have to get the little girl a new unicorn toy.
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!
Go, and hurry!
What are those?
They are my cousins.
Jerry! Stuart!
Watch them, and keep them away from me, please.
-Wow!
-Wow!
It was your cousin's idea.
What?
Okay, bedtime.
Not you two!
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.
Just so you know, you're never gonna be my dad.
I think I can live with that.
Are these beds made out of bombs?
Yes, but they are very old and highly unlikely to blow up.
But try not to toss and turn.
Cool.
-Will you read us a bedtime story?
-No.
But we can't go to sleep without a bedtime story.
Well, then it's going to be a long night for you, isn't it?
So, good night, sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite.
Because there are literally thousands of them.
And there's probably something in your closet.
He's just kidding, Agnes.
It's beautiful.
Girls, let's go.
Time to deliver the cookies!
Okay. But first, we're going to dance class.
Actually, we're going to have to skip the dance class today.
Actually, we can't skip the dance class today.
We have a big recital coming up.
-We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake.
-Yeah, Swan Lake!
That's fantastic. Wonderful.
But we're going to deliver cookies! Come on!
No.
No?
We're not going to deliver cookies until we do dance class.
Really?
Well, I am not driving you to dance class.
So if you want to go, you are going to have to walk yourselves.
What are you doing?
Walking to dance class.
Ya? Okay, fine.
You just keep walking, because I'm really not driving you!
Okay.
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!
And you had better be in this car!
Here we go! One! Two!
...three, four and five.
And lift, and stretch.
And one, and two...
-Here you go.
-What is it?
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?
Of course, of course.
I have pins and needles that I'm sitting on.
Pinkie promise?
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.
All right.
Our first customer is a man named Vector.
But he's a V.
You know, we're supposed to start with the A's.
Then we go to the B's. Then we...
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!
I was just thinking that it might be nice to deliver Mr Vector's first.
That is all.
Almost over. It's almost over.
Girls, welcome back to the fortress of Vector-tude!
Do you have my cookies for me?
Four boxes of mini-mints, two toffee totes, two caramel clumpies and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else order that many cookies.
Not likely.
Name one person who ordered more cookies than me.
That'll be $52.
Right.
Seven, eight, nine...
Tic Tacs! Where was l?
Seven, eight, nine...
Why are you wearing pyjamas?
These aren't pyjamas!
This is a warm-up suit.
-What are you warming up for?
-Stuff.
What sort of stuff?
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.
Like sleeping?
They are not pyjamas!
Here you go, 52 big ones.
Bye!
Come on!
What the...
Quiet down, fish!
Down, boy!
We did it! Come on, girls, let's go!
But what about the other people who ordered cookies?
Life is full of disappointments for some people.
Don't do that!
Super Silly Fun Land! Can we go? Please?
No.
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!
Don't care.
-Please?
-Please?
We'll never ask for anything else, ever again!
-Pretty please?
-Please?
-Come on!
-Come on!
Light bulb.
Come on!
Goodbye, have fun.
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.
What?
Oh, my gosh!
Look at that fluffy unicorn!
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!
You've gotta let us play for it!
No, no, no.
Come on!
How much for the fluffy unicorn?
Well, it is not for sale.
But all you gotta do to win it is knock down that little spaceship there.
It's easy!
Yay!
Again!
-Wait!
-Come on. One more time!
Just one more.
I accidentally closed my eyes.
-I hit it! I hit it!
-That was cool.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?
She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.
Hey, buddy, let me explain something to you.
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?
Do you know what that means, professor?
It means you don't get the unicorn!
Somebody's got a frowny face.
Boo! Better luck next time!
Okay, my turn.
Knocked over!
-It's so fluffy!
-Yeah!
That was awesome!
You blew up the whole thing!
Let's go. Let's try another game!
Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word?
Okay, girls, go play.
I got the shrink ray!
Cotton candy!
We have 12 days until the moon is in optimum position.
We can't afford any distractions!
Get me Perkins.
Sorry to bother you, Mr Perkins, but I figured that you would want to see this!
What?
Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.
Now, the rest of the plan is simple.
I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon.
I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.
What?
Sorry. Sorry!
Could you excuse me for just one second?
I told you not to touch my things.
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.
Hey, can we order pizza?
Pizza? You just had lunch.
Not now, for dinner.
Dinner?
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!
Can we get stuffed crust?
-Stuffed crust!
-Stuffed crust!
I'll stuff you all in the crust!
You're funny!
Just don't come out of that room again!
All right.
Sorry about that. Where were we?
You were sitting on the toilet.
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humour.
I know how much you like to laugh inside. Now, I was saying...
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.
Believe me, I am completely focused.
-Hello!
-What?
That guy is huge!
-Are we on TV?
-What are those? Children?
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!
No, no, no!
Freeze ray!
Mr Gru?
Okay.
As I was saying...
No need to continue. I've seen quite enough.
-But my plan...
-Is a great plan.
I love everything about your plan, except for one thing.
You.
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me landing on the moon!
Look, Mom, I made a prototype of the rocket out of macaroni!
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket based on the macaroni prototype!
I don't understand.
Let's face reality, Gru.
You've been at this for far too long with far too little success.
We're gonna put our faith, our money, into a...
Well, a younger villain.
But l...
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.
Now, I know there have been some rumours going around that the bank is no longer funding us.
Well, I am here to put those rumours to rest.
They are true.
In terms of money, we have no money.
So how will we get to the moon?
The answer is clear.
We won't.
We are doomed.
Now would probably be a good time to look for other employment options.
I know.
I have fired up my resume as I suggest that all of you do, as well.
What is it?
Can't you see that I am in the middle of a pep talk?
Yes!
Yes, we will build our own rocket using this and whatever else we can find!
Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!
Who needs the bank?
Let's go. Let's go!
Mom! What are you doing here?
And here he is in the bathtub.
Look at his little buns.
Mom.
Not cool.
And here, he's all dressed up in his Sunday best.
He looks like a girl!
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!
You're funny!
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!
Mr Perkins, your son is here.
Send him in.
Hey, Dad.
You wanted to see me?
-Yes, I did, Victor.
-I am not Victor any more.
Victor was my nerd name. Now I am Vector!
Sit down!
Do you know where the shrink ray is?
Duh! Back at my place.
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? That's cool.
I guess Gru must just have one that looks exactly like it!
What the... Those girls sold me cookies!
Do you have any idea how lucrative this moon heist could be?
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime, and you just blow it!
-No, I didn't.
-Oh, really?
You just wait until Gru sees my latest weapon.
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!
There's a squid on my face!
Don't worry.
The moon is as good as ours.
Come on now, it's bedtime.
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.
You did not!
Put on your PGs.
Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously!
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!
-But we're not tired!
-Well, I am tired.
Will you read us a bedtime story?
No.
Pretty please!
The physical appearance of the "please" makes no difference.
It is still no, so go to sleep.
But we can't. We're all hyper!
And without a bedtime story, we'll just keep getting up and bugging you.
All night long.
Fine.
All right, all right. Sleepy Kittens.
Sleepy Kittens?
-What are these?
-Puppets.
You use them when you tell the story.
Okay, let's get this over with.
"Three little kittens loved to play, they had fun in the sun all day.
"Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed."'
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?
Keep reading!
-Come on!
-All right, all right, all right.
"Three little kittens started to bawl,
"'Mommy, we're not tired at all.'
"Their mother smiled and said with a purr,
"'Fine, but at least you should brush your fur."'
Now you brush the fur.
This is literature?
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.
"Three little kittens with fur all brushed
"said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed!'
"Their mother replied, with a voice like silk,
"'Fine, but at least you should drink your milk."'
Now make them drink the milk.
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.
"Three little kittens, with milk all gone, rubbed their eyes and started to yawn.
"'We can't sleep, we can't even try.'
Then their mother sang a lullaby.
"'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.
"'Though while you sleep, we are apart,
"'your mommy loves you with all her heart."'
The end. Okay, good night.
-Wait!
-What?
What about good night kisses?
No, no. There will be no kissing or hugging or kissing.
He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes.
I like him. He's nice.
But scary.
Like Santa!
Only 48 hours till the launch, and all systems are go.
About that,
I was thinking that maybe we could move the date of the heist.
Please tell me this is not as a result of the girls' dance recital, is it?
No, no, no!
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!
I just think it's kind of weird to do it on a Saturday.
I was thinking, maybe a heist is a Tuesday thing, right?
Gru, you and I have been working on this for years.
It's everything we've dreamed of.
Your chance to make history, become the man who stole the moon!
But these girls are becoming a major distraction!
They need to go.
If you don't do something about it, then I will.
I understand.
Good.
Butt.
Butt.
Butt.
All right.
Now, when we put our cups together, we will make the "clink" sound with our mouths.
Ready? Edith?
-Clink.
-Clink.
There we go. And now we drink.
And Agnes?
-Clink.
-Clink.
Very good!
Excuse me, girls.
Come on!
Don't worry, I'll be back. Keep clinking.
-Clink, clink.
-Clink, clink.
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?
I'm here for the girls. I received a call that you wanted to return them.
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.
I didn't like what you said.
But...
I will get the girls ready.
Don't let her take us, Mr Gru!
Tell her you wanna keep us.
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.
Goodbye, Mr Gru. Thanks for everything.
I did it for your own good.
Come on, let's go get that moon.
Right.
What is this for?
The recital?
I am the greatest criminal mind of the century.
I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.
And we are good to go in T minus 10 seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
Oh, yeah!
Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.
Boo-ya!
My flight suit.
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...
I've got it!
I've got the moon!
I've got the moon!
I can make it!
-Wait a minute!
-Kevin!
Come on, come on!
He's still not here.
Why would he come? He gave us up.
But he pinkie promised!
Girls, girls, places!
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.
Can we just wait a few more minutes?
All right. But just a few more minutes.
He's not coming, guys.
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!
Okay, okay. There's the library.
That's Third Street. The dance studio...
There! There! There it is!
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.
Over?
Vector, open up!
First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.
-Mr Gru!
-Zip it, Happy Meal.
Now, the girls.
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them a little while longer.
No!
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!
Listen close, you little punk.
When I get in there, you are in for a world of pain!
I'm really scared!
He is gonna kick your butt.
What? He punched my shark!
There he is!
Hang on, Gru.
Oh, no!
Vector has the girls. Go!
What happened to the ship? It's big again!
-Not as big as the moon is going to be!
-What?
The larger the mass of an object, the quicker the effects of the shrink ray wear off!
I call it the Nefario Principle.
I just came up with it now, actually.
Oh, no!
Did you see that?
-Vector! Help!
-Vector!
-Over here!
-Hey!
What are you girls doing back there?
The moon!
Watch out!
Get as close in as you can.
You got it.
-Mr Gru, up here!
-Mr Gru!
Okay, girls! Girls!
-You're going to have to jump.
-Jump?
Are you insane?
Don't worry, I will catch you.
You gave us back!
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.
But you have to jump now.
It'll be okay.
Okay, girls.
Jump now!
Margo, I will catch you.
And I will never let you go again.
-Not so fast!
-No!
Let me go!
Margo!
I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!
I got you.
No!
Oh, poop.
This time, good triumphs, and the moon has been returned to its rightful place in the sky.
But once again, law enforcement is baffled, leaving everyone to wonder, who is this mysterious hero?
And what will he do next?
Okay, girls. Time for bed.
-Come on! We want a story.
-Three sleepy kittens!
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was accidentally destroyed maliciously.
Tonight we are going to read a new book.
This one is called
One Big Unicorn by... Who wrote this?
Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book!
Here, watch this.
That's the horn!
This is gonna be the best book ever!
Not to pat myself on the back, but, yes, it probably will be.
Here we go.
"One big unicorn, strong and free
"thought he was happy as he could be.
"Then three little kittens came around
"and turned his whole life upside down."
Hey, that one looks like me!
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!
Any relation to persons living or dead is completely coincidental.
"They made him laugh.
"They made him cry.
"He never should have said goodbye.
"And now he knows he could never part
"from those three little kittens
"that changed his heart.
"The end."
Okay, all right. Good night.
I love you.
I love you, too.
No, no!
All right.
Didn't I get you already?
They're very good!
I'm so proud of you, Son.
You've turned out to be a great parent!
Just like me.
Maybe even better.
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.
No, no, no!
Hey, Carl! Hey.
No, no, no.
Me, me, me.
John?
No, no. Me, me, me.
Oh, poop.
Oh, no!
Stop! Stop!
Hello, I am Gru.
Back to work, back to work! Back to...
English srt
Dan4Jem, ADMMX
When we locked this file back in 1945,
I hoped we'd never open it again.
Can't we mark it "Rest in Peace"?
Not as long as scientists try to prove porpoises have brains rivaling man's.
Tests are proving these sea creatures possess...
...such amaing faculties that they seem almost human.
Even superhuman.
And they think that he might be teaching them?
- That's right, lieutenant.
- But admiral...
Do you think we can find him after so long?
That's our assignment, to find him.
And to try to get him to coordinate his work with our scientists.
"September, 1941."
That's when it first started.
Yeah, that's when it started.
I never knew him, you know, until after...
- Is that a good likeness?
- Perfect.
Yes. At least that's the way he looked before...
Well, you know...
How he was when...
In September '41 before...
And this...
...taken by one of our divers.
Is there any doubt in your mind?
No, that's him.
Just when I almost managed to forget...
...it all comes back like a nightmare.
- Skipper!
- We have no choice, lieutenant.
Orders from the very top.
They're recalling him to active duty.
And we must stay with it until we complete our mission:
To find...
...Henry Limpet.
I don't know. Henry always lived in a world of his own.
I remember way back when he was working as a bookkeeper in Brooklyn.
There you are, Mr. Limpet.
Thank you, Miss Barnes.
I know what it is to be without your glasses.
Well, did you have your physical this morning?
I suppose we'll be losing you to the Navy soon, then?
- I'm afraid not.
- Really?
No, my eyesight. And a few other things. I'm classified 4-F.
Everybody can't be a hero, Mr. Limpet.
We need men like you at home too.
- Why?
- To give to the blood bank, of course.
They don't want my blood.
- There's always your job at the office.
- Miss Barnes, my job isn't important.
They could hire anybody to replace me.
I'm sure your wife will be happy to know you'll never be called.
Well, I hope so.
But Bessie's very patriotic.
And very healthy. They may take her.
- Henry Limpet.
- Henry?
- Hello, Bessie.
- Henry, George is here...
- George Stickle?
- Yes. Now, Henry...
- He's back on liberty?
- Yes, he is.
- That's nice.
- Did you go to the draft board?
- Yes, I did, Bessie. They rejected me.
- Rejected? Again?
Let's not say too much about this in front of George.
You come straight home from work.
Don't hang around that pet shop.
Don't be upset, Miss Barnes.
There's a fish in the water cooler.
I know. It's mine.
Hi there.
Hi, Hen old boy!
- George, good to see you.
- Good to see you, little buddy.
Don't you look important? That uniform and all those doodads on your sleeve.
- Just a couple of hash marks.
- Don't apologie.
For your information, Henry, I am now a machinist's mate second class.
Machinist's mate second class.
You look first-class to me, George.
What kind of a machine are you mated to?
That's a little bit of humor.
Hey, Bess! Time to take over.
Lover-boy's here.
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, Henry.
Control yourself, Henry.
We have a guest.
- I'm sorry, George.
- I forgive you, Casanova.
Isn't it wonderful?
George has liberty the whole weekend, and he wants to spend it with us.
The whole weekend?
Oh, well, that's great.
Well, little buddy,
I hear you missed the boat, huh?
The boat? No, I missed the subway train, but l...
No, no, Hanky pal, down at the draft board.
Washed out completely, I hear.
Oh, that. You can't win them all, George.
Bessie?
Yes, George. What is it?
What say we clear the decks for action, go dancing?
- Feel like shaking a leg, Henry?
- No thanks, George.
I can't. I have faulty equilibrium due to poor vision.
How many times must I tell you, you do not rumba with your eyes!
Now, don't worry.
We'll think of something exciting.
Say, listen, I have an idea.
Why don't we go to the university for Professor Hoffmeyer's lecture?
- Lecture?
- On decapods of the genera Pagurus.
You know, he's gonna talk about the mating habits of the shellfish.
It's a little risqué.
Sort of for adults only, you know.
I'll just pass on that action.
I've got a weak heart.
I've got it! Why don't we run out to Coney Island tomorrow morning?
- Well, I don't know...
- Henry!
You do not have to eat clam chowder because it's Coney Island! We'll go!
I hate to miss that lecture, but I do like the water.
Water and fish.
If you paid half as much attention to me as those fish, I'd be happy!
It's just that fish are so bright and cheerful. And so beautiful.
Look at him. Always drawing into his shell, going off into his fish world!
Say, old boy, if you just stand there staring down...
...at that cup of sardines, you're liable to go off your nut.
George, come here.
Have you given much thought to the Devonian Period?
- The what?
- Devonian Period of the Paleooic Era.
You know, it followed the Silurian and preceded the Carboniferous Eras.
- I try not to think of things like that.
- I've given it a lot of thought.
A lot of thought.
Do you realie our ancestors were fish?
Maybe your ancestors, Henry, not mine.
Maybe you ought to try to find a new hobby. Maybe go in for parakeets.
- I'm not joking. I can explain.
- He sure can.
He's read many books on the subject.
He claims years ago there was nothing but fish in the world.
That's right. Then some of those creatures became amphibians...
...they crawled out on land. Millions of years later they became men.
- I know some who ought to crawl back.
- Doesn't it give you a thrill of hope?
Hope for what, Henry?
With the war in Europe and new weapons being invented...
...what if men were foolish enough to destroy themselves?
Then the fish would develop into a new race of men...
...and this time they might turn out better.
How would you like a cocktail, George?
Fine, fine.
Excuse me.
I wish I were a fish.
Fish have a better life than people.
Henry! The water!
What a mess!
- Just look at my rug!
- I've got it stopped now, Bessie.
You are floating yourself out of your home with this hobby!
I'm gonna run down to the store and get a regulator for the intake hose.
Take all of this junk with you!
The fish, tank, bowl, the whole works!
- You mean get rid of them?!
- You bet I do! Everything out!
- But Bessie!
- Either those fish go or I do!
Which is it to be?
I keep remembering how hurt they looked when I left them.
- Who looked hurt?
- My fish. When I left them at the shop.
For heaven's sake, forget that.
We're out to enjoy ourselves.
For once.
Say, did I tell you about my patrol duty near Bermuda?
- You wrote us all about that.
- I left out the most exciting details.
See, I don't like to brag but, I tell you, that one morning...
- It was at night, wasn't it?
- Right. Good memory.
We went out with me in the engine room...
I thought you were on the bridge with the admiral?
Was it you or George who made that voyage?
I'm sorry, George.
There are things you don't mention in the open.
We're not in the war. Why can't you tell us about your destroyer?
The USS Elias J. Starbright, isn't it?
Keep it down about my ship, will you?
There's things you don't understand, not being in the service.
- I tried.
- I can tell you this, though.
There are so many Nazi subs below the surface you could walk to Europe.
The ocean's jumping with U-boats ready to go if Uncle Sam gets in the fight.
I don't want to start a panic, so you keep all this under your hat, right?
Right, Bessie?
Old boy, did I ever tell you about the Caribbean?
What a liberty we had in a port near Trinidad!
And Miami. Wow.
- Did you ever do the rumba, Henry?
- Huh? No, I have faulty equilibrium.
Yes, sir. Join the Navy and have a whirl!
Barbados, Kingston, the Virgin Islands!
Lunch is almost ready.
It must be wonderful down there in your world.
Not a 4-F in the bunch.
Come along, Henry!
I don't wanna wait a million years to go back again.
More than anything, I wish
I could be one of you right now.
I wish...
I wish I were a fish.
Henry! George, Henry can't swim.
Save him!
What will we do?
Save him!
Get some help! Call the lifeguards!
Get the police!
Police! Lifeguard! Help!
You all right, son?
Come on. All right, move out.
It's all over.
Sorry, Bessie. I'll try again.
He doesn't even know how to swim.
And Bessie thought I couldn't swim.
He doesn't know how to swim!
Keep it clear here!
Let me help you, son.
Bessie! What's gonna happen to poor Bessie?
- Did you see any sign of him at all?
- Afraid he's gone.
Guess he must have lost his glasses during the fall.
- I saw a fish wearing them.
- Fish?
- Oh, no. Oh, George!
- Now, now.
There Bessie, we'd better get going home now.
There we go.
All right, folks, back up, please.
Let us through.
And I thought it all would be so beautiful.
Wish I were home with Bessie.
What am I gonna do now?
Bessie won't like it at all.
I've never stayed out all night before.
Maybe I should have listened to Bessie.
I got this back from the pet shop.
It didn't seem right leaving it, with Henry...
Well, he was so cray about it.
Don't you think it would make a nice planter?
Sure. And you could fix it up with dried seaweed and stuff.
- Make sort of a memorial for old Hen.
- That's sweet.
- And I think he would appreciate that.
- Here's the notice:
"Henry Limpet, a bookkeeper, residing at 1313 Pleasant Avenue, Flatbush...
...fell or jumped from a pier at Coney
Island. The body was not recovered.
Limpet is survived by his widow,
Bessie Limpet."
Poor Henry.
Hi!
Gee, I must be nearing Florida.
Parrotfish live in southern waters.
Hi! I'm Henry Limpet. I'm...
Jumping St. Elmo's fire! Who in blue blaes invited you in here?
- What is it?
- Slamming into my private quarters.
Come about and stand by for action, you four-eyed flounder!
Say, you're talking to me.
You bet your binnacle
I'm talking to you!
Now, hoist your tail and get!
Why, you're a splendid specimen of a Pagurus pollicaris.
In common terminology, you're a crustacean, a hermit crab.
- I'm glad to meet you, Crusty.
- Crusty! That does it!
Put up your fins! I'm gonna swab the ocean floor with you.
Hey! Take it easy.
I don't wanna fight!
Let that be a lesson to you, you confounded, four-eyed...
Say, what are you, anyway?
You related to the porpoise family?
No, I'm a Limpet. Henry Limpet from
Brooklyn. You know, Flatbush.
I've seen flat fish, but I've never seen no four-eyed flat bush.
Well, you see, l...
Well, I'm not really a fish,
I'm a man.
Or I was a man until quite recently.
Listen, Flatbush, anything I hate, it's a smart-aleck fish.
I didn't mean to barge in on you, but a shark was chasing me.
Shark! Jumping jellyfish!
Just swing about and let that shark chase you full speed away from here!
Golly! Did that come out of me?
Hurricane! Typhoon!
Stand by for a blow!
There's no hurricane.
It was just me.
Just you? You mean to say that blast came out of you?
Why, you loudmouth son of a bellerin' barracuda!
That belch of yours could capsie me in the backwash.
If you sound off like that again,
I swear...
...I'll batten your gills and lower the boom on you.
And furthermore...
Crusty?
Crusty? You all right, Crusty?
Gotta hand it to you.
That whale-busting noise of yours is really something.
That blob of shrimp bait'll think twice before he fools with us again.
Well, guess I'll be off.
Off? Where are you going?
I'd like to see if I can locate others of my kind.
I figure I'd better go along to keep you out of trouble.
Hey, great! Climb aboard, Crusty.
I'll bet I'm gonna be busier than a one-armed octopus with hives.
We're off!
All right, Flatbush, let her rip.
Look! A freighter!
Hey, let's not get too close to the critter.
Don't worry, it's not alive.
Not alive? Suffering swordfish!
What kind of sea monster killed a whopper like that?
A torpedo did it.
A torpedo?
Full speed away before that blasted torpedo comes back.
Oh, they won't attack us, they're just after ships.
Hey, don't go moseying around in this thing's innards.
No wonder this thing died!
Look at the kind of stuff it ate.
Here's the captain's logbook.
Hey, listen to what it says.
This ship was carrying important cargo for the Allies.
Listen to what it says?
I didn't hear it say anything.
There must be a way to stop the Nazi submarines.
If only I could help.
Quit mumbling to yourself, Flatbush.
Come on, let's shove off.
This must be the captain's cabin.
Crusty, there's another fish in here!
A vicious-Iooking brute!
Ugliest critter I've ever seen.
Gangway, get me out of here!
It's only a mirror. It's me.
That's what I look like.
Well, swab my scuppers.
Another Flatbush.
I'm not a bad-Iooking fish at that.
Really, a pretty unique specimen.
You've got some good points, but beauty ain't one of them.
Look at that strong gill structure.
Did you ever see such a fine dorsal formation?
But maybe I'm a freak!
Am I gonna be like this for just a little while or always?
I'm probably the only one of my kind.
If only there was another fish like me. Even just one.
Someone who would understand me.
- Listen. Don't you hear that sound?
- What sound?
I better go up topside and have a look.
How awful!
Did you see that?
They're trained to save each other!
Are you all right?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Well, gosh...
That was nothing at all.
I mean, nothing.
Oh, yes, it was.
It was very nice of you.
And very clever.
It was just a simple thing, really.
I mean, anyone could have done it.
Well, I think you're wonderful.
Say, does that mean that you...
...like me?
- Oh, yes, I like you very...
...very much.
- Is that right?
Well, golly, I mean...
- What's your name?
- Name?
- I don't know what you mean.
- What people...
- I mean, what fish call you by.
- I've never heard of such a thing.
Well, let's see.
I'll call you Ladyfish.
Do you like that?
Yeah, Ladyfish!
By the way, my name is Limpet.
Henry...
Limpet.
- All right, Limpet, shall we go?
- Go? Go where?
Why, to the spawning grounds.
After what you did for me, l...
Now, wait!
You don't know what you're saying.
Oh, but I do.
All I can say is:
Mush and bilge water!
Well? Do you like it?
Wow!
Bessie, you're a knockout!
Know what that dress reminds me of?
The first time I saw you. Remember?
Your pop brought me for dinner.
Oh, George, imagine your remembering after all these years.
Thank you.
That was even before Henry...
Limpet, what is that on your nose?
On my nose?
Those are my eyeglasses.
- You see, I have a little astigmatism.
- Tigma-tism.
Astigmatisms must be very nice.
They make you look so distinguished.
Well, they help me to see a long way off.
Do you see that barracuda coming at us?
Oh, Limpet, Limpet, we'll be killed!
Just watch this!
You're very wonderful.
Shall we go?
Ladyfish...?
You see, you don't understand.
See, I have to tell you that...
Well, I'm married.
Married? What is that?
Well, I have a wife.
Is that like astigmatism?
Oh, no, I mean, I already have another lady fish.
Oh, that! Shall we go?
- It doesn't make a difference to you?
- I don't see why it should.
Well, it's just not done.
Do you spawn with every Tom,
Dick and fish that comes along?
Oh, no. You see, up until now
I've been too young.
Yes, of course. I understand.
Now shall we go?
Now, look, Ladyfish, l...
I'd sure like...
Well, that is to say...
Do you suppose that we could just be...
...well, more or less friends?
Friends?
Wouldn't that be more or less nothing, Limpet?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
But...
I mean, it wouldn't be proper.
Gosh, I can't.
But, Ladyfish! I didn't mean it!
Ladyfish!
Ladyfish!
Oh, Ladyfish!
Oh, Ladyfish!
It's no use. I've searched everywhere.
Sunday, December 7, 1941.
The nation was stunned to hear the news this morning...
...of the unprovoked attack that has led to a state of war.
The rest is a mere formality.
Sources say the president will ask Congress...
Our country at war?
Technically...
...I'm not 4-F anymore.
I know, I'll go back to Brooklyn,
I'll find George Stickle and I'II...
...I'll do something!
What's all this blabberdash about war and 4-F, and Stickle and like that?
Look, Flatbush, if you're in trouble, you can count on me.
If you'd stay here and look out for Ladyfish, I'd be grateful.
Not me, I'm going with you!
Oh, please, it's important, Crusty.
Tell her I love her and I'll be back soon.
Well, all right. If you don't need me.
Oh, I need you more than ever, old fellow.
To look after her while I'm gone.
Flatbush, take it easy, huh?
I will, Crusty.
Thanks.
So long, Flatbush!
They're missing the U-boat!
Ahoy there!
Ship ahoy!
Ahoy! Ship ahoy!
- Who's out there?
- A friend.
Ahoy there!
Ship ahoy!
Don't be alarmed. Please don't!
Are you on a raft?
No, I'm swimming. I'm a fish!
Good lord, a comedian!
Ahoy there!
- What are you doing?
- We've got an unidentified contact.
Why didn't you identify it?
There's a war going on!
Give the recognition signal!
- I can't!
- Give the recognition signal!
I'm Henry Limpet.
I fell in the ocean and was drowned.
Only I wasn't drowned, exactly.
- Hit him with the light.
- Hit him with the light!
Give the recognition signal!
- Commence firing!
- Commence firing!
Activate sonar dome.
Must be the ship's underwater listening device.
Now hear this!
This is Henry Limpet speaking.
This is Henry Limpet.
You missed the sub.
All engines ahead full.
Left standard rudder.
The old man should hear this.
Pipe it to the bridge!
All engines ahead full.
Left standard rudder.
All engines ahead full, left standard rudder?
All engines ahead full, sir.
The enemy's hiding on the bottom.
400 yards...
...straight ahead.
Set your charges for 200 feet.
Oil slick on the starboard beam, sir.
A direct hit.
Keep scanning. Could be a Nazi trick.
Cut that light! I'm the friend who guided you to the U-boat.
If you're friendly, give the recognition signal!
How can I convince you I'm a plain
American trying to serve my country?
Give the recognition signal at once or we'll commence firing depth charges.
Now, look! You were trying to locate a submarine, weren't you?
You couldn't find it, could you?
And I told you where it was, didn't I?
And then you got it, didn't you?
We cannot see you!
How are you staying afloat?
I'd rather not say at the moment, you wouldn't believe me.
What the blasted blaes is this?
If you wanna know who I am and what
I can do, bring George Stickle...
...machinist mate second class, and you'll learn the answer.
What do you make of it?
Probably a Nazi trick, just as you said, sir.
You want to meet with somebody called Pickle?
Not Pickle! Stickle!
Machinist Mate Second Class
George Stickle!
On the USS Elias J. Starbright!
I'll do what I can. I'll send a full report of this meeting in...
...but I can't guarantee Pickle.
Stickle!
Good. I'll be at this same spot three days from now.
Left full rudder, all engines ahead full.
Wait till this hits the Navy department.
Harlock, you've either been drinking or you've got combat fatigue!
Believe me, admiral, this voice seemed to come right out of the water!
We haven't time for nonsense.
We've got a war here.
- That's just it, admiral.
- What is?
The voice... Whatever it is.
It seems to be most efficient.
It led us to a Nazi sub and directed our charges accurately.
All right, Harlock.
Let's say you heard this voice.
And it did what you say.
What's your explanation for this phenomenon?
I don't know, sir. I only know that it's friendly and cooperative.
It wants to work with us.
Blast it, Harlock!
We can't enlist a voice!
Why? It directed our depth charges correctly.
I'm not going on record as the admiral who was sent away...
...because he believed in voices from the ocean.
Why not delegate the responsibility to someone else?
There's nobody else cray enough to take it. Except yourself.
Oh, not me, admiral, l...
Maybe Machinist Mate Second
Class Pickle... Stickle.
Who is he?
The voice asked us to bring Stickle out to meet with him.
Or it.
I think we can arrange a leave for you immediately. Take a good long rest.
Think what this means.
It could spot submarines all over.
Within a year we could break the Nazi U-boat threat.
All right, Harlock. We'll arrange for Stickle to meet with this voice.
Until we learn the nature of this device, it will remain top-secret.
- No discussion of it beyond this room.
- Certainly, admiral.
Except between Stickle and yourself.
You're to shoulder complete responsibility for this secret weapon.
Commander, you've got to believe me!
I know nothing of this.
I'm just a machinist mate second class...
I know all about you, Pickle.
Uh, Stickle.
I hunted through half the Navy to find you.
- Yes, sir, but may I ask...?
- You may not! I'll ask.
You have been summoned here by a voice from the sea.
- I have, sir?
- Yes.
It claims to be your friend. Who do you know that might be down there?
I don't know anyone down there, sir.
Maybe a buddy on a submarine.
It did not come from a submarine.
So help me, sir,
I don't know anything about this!
When the voice hails us, you'll talk to it until we get a fix on it.
And destroy it if necessary.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir. Yes.
Ahoy there!
Ahoy out there!
Did you hail us three days ago?
I did!
- Did you bring George Stickle?
- He's here.
Say something, quick!
Talk, sailor!
Ahoy... Ahoy there!
This is George.
George Stickle.
Hi, George. This is Henry Limpet.
George! Did you hear me?
This is Henry!
How are you, George?
Come on, sailor! For heaven's sake, get a grip on yourself! Keep him occupied.
Hello, Henry. It's good to hear you.
- It's impossible! Limpet is dead!
- Just keep him talking.
We've got four other ships closing in on him.
This is a real surprise, Henry.
Real!
Everybody thinks you're dead.
I'm not, George. I'm just...
Well, a little different.
- Sure sounds like Henry's voice.
- Sir?
Radar can't detect anything.
There's no engine vibrations.
We do have a hydrophone fix on the voice.
- Hit him with light.
- I've got to talk to you, George.
It's awful urgent!
George! George, why don't you answer me?
Turn that light off or I'll go away right now!
Secure that light!
That's better.
Now, listen to me, George.
Have them put you in a little boat all alone, and come out here to meet me.
Break out a rubber life raft.
Rubber...?
Oh, no!
You can't make me...
You're the key to this mystery,
Stickle. You have to go.
Don't worry, we'll give you a strong flashlight. Put him in the boat.
Henry, it's me. George Stickle.
I'm right here, George!
Where? Where, I don't see you.
- Don't turn that flashlight on.
- No, no, no, certainly not, Henry.
You don't know how glad
I am to see you, George.
Look, if you're really Henry, what are you doing out here in the ocean?
Remember when you jumped in the water after me at Coney Island?
I sure do.
Didn't you see a fish?
A rather strange fish?
Well, no. No, I don't think...
Hey, wait. I did!
And I thought it was wearing glasses like yours...
...only I was so upset, it was just my imagination.
No, George, that was me.
You?! You, a fish!
If you were a fish, you certainly would need to wear your glasses, Henry.
If you'll pardon me now,
I gotta get going.
All right, I suppose you have to see to believe.
You can turn the light on me.
Now do you believe me, George?
Excuse me a minute. Gotta go down for air. You know, a fish out of water.
No!
Oh, it's impossible!
Remember how you'd come over on Friday nights?
You and Bessie would play poker while I read myself to sleep?
That's right. Regular as clockwork, every Friday night.
How about the time the three of us went to the oo?
I got separated from you two. I had to walk home. Bessie had my cash.
Oh, yes, I'll never forget that.
Hey, wait a minute!
Only Henry Limpet would know all that!
- You are Henry!
- Yes, George.
Is there...? Is there anything
I can do for you, Henry?
Well, I wanted to talk to you about my helping the Navy.
- You, in the Navy?!
- Yeah, I want to help.
I can help spot Nazi subs or guide destroyers to them.
Maybe scouting around as an underseas patrol, or dozens of things.
Sure, Henry. I see where you'd be quite a help to the Navy.
Speak to the Navy right away.
Go right to the top. I don't want to waste time on red tape.
Well, I want to know about Bessie.
Is she all right?
She's still in a state of shock about your being drowned.
You can tell her now
I wasn't drowned.
Gosh, Henry, you certainly do sound different.
- You really have changed!
- You don't know the half of it.
Nothing like realiing your value to make a man out of you.
Even if that man is a fish. Tell me when there's word from the Navy.
Yes, I'll certainly do the best I can, Henry.
If we ever need you, we'll just use the oscillator gear.
- You think you can hear it?
- I'll hear it.
I've stayed above too long.
Wonderful talking to you. See you!
Goodbye, Henry.
A fish!
Harlock, you're cracking up.
We have to admit there's something out there.
Call it a fish, or a secret weapon, or whatever you wish...
...but it's there!
Pickle, Stickle saw it.
Talked to it.
And it's offered to help.
All right, Harlock. We'll assign this secret weapon to your ship.
- Let it help you if you think it can.
- Thank you.
But please stop bringing these fantastic reports to me.
I'm gonna have a hard enough time explaining this to the Pentagon.
- I understand.
- And this is still top-secret.
Your secret, Harlock!
Yes, admiral. I was at the point of calling you about that secret weapon.
Oh, wonderful progress, sir, wonderful.
Research phase accomplished, operational testing underway.
Oh, one little thing, sir.
This mission merits our pushing through a rating for Stickle...
...and a promotion for Harlock.
No, no, sir.
I wasn't expecting anything for myself. No, just doing my duty.
Of course, if you insist.
Vice admiral.
Hello, George. I heard the oscillator and got here as fast as I could.
- Good news?
- Very good news, Henry.
The Navy has agreed to accept your services.
We've been assigned to Commander Harlock's destroyer.
- That's wonderful.
- That's quite an honor, Henry.
- Very unusual for a civilian.
- Very unusual for a fish too.
Here's the hydrophone.
Oh, a water-talkie. Thanks.
Limpet to Stickle.
Okay.
Henry. Now, hear this.
They'd like you to give the Navy a little assist.
Just hunt down Nazi U-boats and lead us to them.
You'll be under my direct command.
- I'm your liaison with the fleet.
- I like that, George.
It won't be necessary for you to salute me or address me as "sir"...
...even though I've been promoted to piscatorial specialist first class.
- Fine. Now, what's the first order?
- They go on the prowl at 1:00.
- How do we keep in contact?
- Signal me through the oscillator...
...and I'll signal you with my thrum.
- Your what?
It's a remarkable sound I make now.
Goes over big underwater. Like this:
Did you hear it?
Sure did. I'll pick that up, all right.
Good luck, Henry.
And full speed ahead.
Aye, aye, George.
Drop your charges! Hurry!
The answer to Das Limpet.
With the thrum sound-maker.
The führer's super-secret weapon!
The perfect Nazi counter-weapon to blit the American underwater secret.
Our new beeper torpedoes will react to the thrum, and boom!
You're doing a very nice job.
Captain Harlock is pleased.
I'm glad, George.
Isn't that a new rating you're sporting?
Yeah, they gave me this little promotion here.
Chief petty officer, you know.
Skipper too. He's a four-striper now.
And Admiral Spewter, our big boss...
...he's moving right up there.
Congratulations.
I suppose I'm in all the papers.
You? Well...
Well, no, you're not, Henry.
Why not?
You're top-secret.
- We can't let a thing like this out.
- Yeah, I suppose not.
There's a couple of things I must talk to you about. Very important.
Gentlemen, this is the rendevous point for the mammoth convoy.
Captain Harlock's destroyer will assume a vanguard position there.
And the Limpet will be out in front of Harlock.
This convoy must get through safely.
On its safe voyage depends...
...the Allies' greatest effort:
The invasion of Europe!
I'm Captain Harlock. I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's rather urgent.
- It may change plans for the convoy.
- Yes.
May I speak with Admiral Spewter?
It concerns the liaison problem...
...with the secret weapon.
- Yes, certainly.
Excuse me, sir.
The cruiser Los Angeles will be the guide.
Vice Admiral Jones will be the OTC and will fly his flag...
All right, Harlock. What is it?
You interrupted an important briefing.
Stickle has relayed a request from the secret weapon.
I told you that was your responsibility.
I know, but I don't have the authority...
...to act on this unusual request.
- Now what?
- He wants to be paid.
What?
Are you out of your mind, Harlock?
How can we pay a fish?
He wants the pay sent to his wife in Brooklyn.
The fish has a wife in Brooklyn?
She's not a fish. She's a real woman.
I should've thrown you out when you came to me with this story.
All right, I suppose we can find some way...
...to push this through the paymaster's office.
- British screening units will deploy to their assigned ports...
There's more?
He also wants a lieutenant's commission.
No. Absolutely, no!
It's impossible to hold two meetings here at once. May I join yours?
I'm sorry. The news Harlock brought is quite disturbing.
If it concerns the secret weapon,
I'd like to hear it.
Our secret weapon wants to be paid.
He wants a lieutenant's commission.
Then Admiral Spewter, I suggest you pay him, and commission him. Immediately!
Commission?
But, sir, you don't understand.
I understand the secret weapon is the most vital key to the safe conduct of our convoy.
I order you to commission the secret weapon personally!
Henry's here now, sir.
You ready to begin the ceremonies?
Henry Limpet, this is to inform you that...
Sir. No, sir.
He's over that way, sir.
I think you can see him out there.
Port beam. You can see him, can't you?
I might if I cared to look.
- Limpet, raise your right hand.
- Sir, sir...
Raise your right fin and I will now swear you in...
...Lieutenant Limpet.
A check for me? From the Navy?
What does it mean, George?
It's made out to you, but it's for Henry's services.
Henry? When was Henry ever in the Navy?
You better get a grip on yourself, Bessie.
He's in the Navy right now.
- Henry's alive?
- Yes, but you see that...
I'm going to him.
I'm going this minute.
- Now, Bessie.
- Take me to him.
- Now, Bessie.
- Why wasn't I told this before?
How long has he been alive?
I mean, when did he...?
- He didn't drown?
- No.
No, but brace yourself, Bessie.
He's changed.
You can't see him.
You wouldn't want to.
I do want to. How can you say a thing like that? Why can't I see him?
Believe me Bessie, it's impossible.
His work for the Navy is top-secret.
Just be happy with his paycheck.
Don't even mention his name to anyone.
- George, there's something very fishy about this.
- You said it.
A Mrs. Fish? What about a Mrs. Fish?
No. Not a Mrs. Fish, sir.
Mrs. Limpet.
- The wife of the fish.
- Spewter...
She's a forceful woman, headstrong and determined.
She demands that we change her husband from a fish back into a man.
Sounds like a most humane and reasonable request. Do it!
Do it.
I beg your pardon, sir.
How do we do it?
- You claim he turned into a fish.
- So I understand.
Then it's simple.
Just reverse the process.
Reverse?
- We'll try, sir.
- You'll do nothing of the sort.
We have a weapon of effectiveness.
Guard it with your life.
Don't even touch it, understand?
Now, never come to me again with a request like that.
At a time like this.
When we have a convoy on our hands...
...ready for the biggest push of the war.
If Bessie could see me now.
Not bad for a 4-F fish.
The spearhead of the spearhead.
Imagine! This might make me a national hero.
My glasses. I must find my glasses.
The convoy. I'm losing the convoy.
Without my glasses, we're sunk.
Sunk? Just when the Navy needs me most.
Himmel and Blitels!
It's that female Flatbush.
Ladyfish, got a message for you from Limpet.
He said he loves you and other such mush like that.
He loves me?
Oh, he loves me!
I don't love you, he does.
Silly female.
Oh, Crusty, do you think he'll ever come back?
Don't get yourself into a tiy now, Ladyfish.
If I know Flatbush, he'll be back.
Listen!
Listen! It's him.
It's Limpet!
Ladyfish.
Limpet, I've never heard anything more beautiful than that noise you make.
Ladyfish, I'm in terrible trouble.
I can't see.
Come along.
Any sign of him yet?
Not yet, sir.
He better show up soon or the whole operation will be snafued.
I'm not completely blind, but things are awful fuzzy.
Flatbush, what in tarnation...?
I'm in an awful predicament.
I need some glasses, and...
I noticed you were missing some eyes.
I've got to get back to my convoy!
But how will I find it?
I'll be your eyes. I'll climb topside and serve as your navigator.
The sound of the convoy will guide me, and with you navigating, why...
- I can't ask you to risk your life.
- Risk my life?
Hold everything.
Maybe I ought to put on something more torpedo-proof.
- Ladyfish...
- Limpet.
- I've got to go now. I'm on duty.
- Does that mean you'll be leaving me?
Don't you care for me at all, Limpet?
But I have an important job to do before we can talk about that anymore.
Let's shove off.
- Then I'm going with you too.
- You can't.
It's a very dangerous mission.
Wait for me here.
All right, cast off. Full speed ahead.
No, hard aport. Full reverse.
Come about full, then steady as she goes.
I'll always wait for you, Limpet.
Slow down, gosh darn it. I ain't got the hang of steering you yet.
Haul up your keel!
Darned near shivered your timbers that time.
Dagnab it. Hey, Flatbush, wait!
Hold it! Wait!
He makes a...
A thrum.
Sorry, chief, no thrums.
Stickle!
Any contact with that piscatorial lieutenant pal?
- We're nearing enemy water, Stickle.
- Sir, it's not my fault.
Maybe Henry has laryngitis.
Me and my secret weapon!
We've come quite a way. I still can't pick up any sound of the convoy.
Do you see anything?
No. Say, why don't you make that whale-busting noise of yours again?
- Let them know you're on your way.
- I should've thought of that.
Just hold up a minute till I get inside.
I hear the convoy now. Dead ahead.
- Hooray, we finally made it!
- Stop. Hold it. Hold it.
Whole school of big ones, coming dead at us.
Hard right rudder. Hard right.
They're attacking our convoy!
They're coming at us!
Stop making that whale-busting thrum of yours. Those things go for it.
Yeah, how about that?
Then I'll just keep it up.
Follow me, you beeping devil.
We'll take it right back where it came from.
- What's happening below?
- I don't know, sir. Might be Henry.
Something big is going on down there.
Them torpedoes pack a walloping thrum too.
Great! They hit their own boats.
We've got the system now. We'll just let them knock themselves out.
We gonna drop depth charges, skipper?
No, we don't dare.
Crash dive!
Help!
It's about time you showed up.
George.
I gotta talk to George Stickle.
George Stickle.
Henry!
Where have you been? You put me in a terrible spot when we lost contact.
I'm sorry, George.
I had a little accident.
I lost my glasses.
Nice work anyhow, Henry.
I'll see Bessie when we get back and have her get you a new pair.
We'll meet at Coney Island when this is over.
Aye, aye, George. See you at Coney when it's all over. Carry on.
Limpet, you did come back.
Yes, Ladyfish. And you did wait.
- You're coming with me now?
- No, but you're coming with me.
You see, I love you, but I don't know if I have any right to.
I've got to talk to my wife first.
You and I have to make a trip to Coney Island.
I can be your other eyes now.
Take over. I'm not going.
I'd probably drown in all the slush.
Thanks for all your wonderful help, Crusty.
Forget it. I like the bachelor life.
So long, Flatbush.
Hate to admit it, but I'm gonna miss him.
Had to lose my best buddy to a frilly female.
Better get rid of this battle gear and get back to my civvies.
What if I told you I was once a human being?
I don't care how terrible your past was, Limpet.
I'll help you forget.
I've forgotten an awful lot already.
So long, Flatbush.
I'll never leave you, and I hope you'll never leave me.
It's always the males who leave in our species.
That's why there's so few of us.
In that case, there might be more before long.
You and I could be the beginning of a whole new and better world.
I know where we are now. Follow me.
There, that's my wife.
Not much to look at, is she?
Actually, for a human, she's quite lovely.
Let's get this over with, Limpet.
The water here is very cold.
Hello, Bessie.
Henry, is that you?
Don't you recognie me, Bessie?
Henry, you really are...
A fish? Yes, Bessie, you can say it.
To think you're actually still alive, and I'm married to a...
A fish. Is that so terrible?
It doesn't happen every day.
Well, what's new? I mean, how have you been, Bessie?
Well, I'm...
I'm bewildered, Henry.
Henry, am I the widow of a man...
...or the wife of a fish?
Let's be logical. You couldn't keep me in a tub, could you?
I suppose not. No.
- I mean, what would the neighbors say?
- I shudder to think.
You know how that Miss Harris objects every time I fry fish. Why...
Oh, good heavens.
Well, there you are.
Are you really happier down there, Henry?
If you only knew, Bessie.
I guess this is goodbye, Henry.
If you'll come up to the steps,
I have something for you.
Take care of yourself, Henry.
Remember how you catch cold when you get your feet wet.
Don't break up, Bessie. I'm just fine.
Maybe I was meant to be a fish.
Maybe nature just corrected her error.
Maybe.
Goodbye, Henry.
Goodbye, Bessie. And thanks for being sensible about this. And understanding.
- Goodbye, Henry.
- So long, George.
Take good care of Bessie.
Tell them not to look for me.
They won't find me.
"Goodbye, Henry," I said.
And I saluted.
I thought that was it.
Bessie and I have been happy.
Why stir this thing up again?
The chief of naval operations ordered it.
Do they really think that Henry is teaching porpoises?
That's what we've been assigned to find out. You and I, Pickle. Stickle.
Where do we start to look?
Maybe that spot off the Florida coast where Henry first contacted you.
It's worth a try. Get the old man.
He's going with us.
The secretary of defense ordered him to take command of this mission.
"On behalf of the secretary of defense, and speaking for a grateful nation...
...I'm empowered to advance you to the rank of commodore...
...United States Naval Reserve."
And now, commodore...
...regarding porpoise activities...
Through the snow and sleet and hail... through the blizzard, through the gale... through the wind and through the rain... over mountain, over plain... through the blinding lightning flash... and the mighty thunder crash... ever faithful, ever true... nothing stops him.
He'll get through.
Look out for Mr Stork that persevering chap
He'll come along and drop a bundle in your lap
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which
Millionaires, they get theirs like the butcher and the baker
So look out for Mr Stork and let me tell you, friend
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end
He'll spot you out in China or he'll fly to County Cork
So you'd better look out for Mr Stork
Look out for Mr Stork
He's got you on his list
And when he comes around it's useless to resist
Remember those quintuplets and the woman in the shoe
Maybe he's got his eye on you
All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard! Let's go!
Casey Junior's comin'down the track
Comin'down the track with a smoky stack
Hear him puffin' comin'round the hill
Casey's here to thrill every Jack and Jill
Every time his funny little whistle sounds

- In here! In here!
- Yoo-hoo!
- This is the place.
- Whew! At last.
Which one of you ladies is expecting?
- Hmph! Not me.
- The very idea.
Certainly not.
Over there, of course.
Yes, of course.
Right over there.
Oh. Of course.
Here is a baby with eyes of blue... straight from heaven right to you.
Or: Straight from heaven up above... here is a baby for you to love.
Sign here, please.
Uh, yeah. Well... Oh. Mrs Jumbo.
Uh, one moment, please.
This is still part of the service.
Happy Birthday to you
Ah, Happy Birthday to you
Ah, Happy Birthday, dear
Ah, dear
Dear me. What's his name?

- Oh, do hurry, dear.
- I'm on pins and needles.
- Isn't it thrilling?
- I'm all a-flutter.
Ah, this is a proud, proud day.
- Well, hurry and open it, dearie.
- I'm just dying to see.
- Oh!
- Look at him!
Look at him!
Oh, what a... Oh, look!
- Oh, you sweet little thing.
- He is cute, isn't he?
Oh, he is a darling little baby.
Adorable. Simply adorable.
Did you ever see anything so cunning?
Isn't he a darling!
Kootchy, kootchy, kootchy, kootchy, kootchy, kootchy.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Is it possible?
- Isn't there some mistake?
Just look at those, those...
E-A-R-S.
Those what? Oh, ears!
These! Aren't they funny? Oh!
- Oh, my goodness.
- What a temper.
Oh, what did I do?
Well, tell me.
- Did I say anything?
- Perfectly harmless remark.
I just said that they're funny, and they are funny.
- They certainly are.
- After all, who cares... about her precious little Jumbo?
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo.
Dumbo.
- Dumbo, I say.
- That's good.
- Dumbo! That's good.
- Dumbo.
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can.
I thought I could. I thought I could.
I thought I could. I thought I could.
Whoo-woo!
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike
We work all day
We work all night
We never learned to read or write
We're happy-hearted roustabouts
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike
When other folks have gone to bed
We slave until we're almost dead
We're happy-hearted roustabouts
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike
We don't know when we get our pay
And when we do we throw our pay away
When we get our pay we throw our money all away
We get our pay when children say
With happy hearts
It's circus day today
Then we get our pay just watching kids on circus day
Muscles aching
Back near breaking
Eggs and bacon's what we need
- Yes, sir!
- Boss man houndin'
Keep on poundin'
For your bread and keep
There ain't no letup

Grab that rope, you hairy ape
Poundin', poundin'
Poundin', poundin'
Oh
Jostling and juggling.
Fifteen minutes!
Step right up and get your tickets.
Hurry, hurry now.
Hurry to the big sideshow.
That's why you go under the big top.
Fifteen big attractions that you can't see anywhere else in the world!
The greatest collection in the entire world.
And the greatest comedies are featured and assembled for your entertainment.
Ain't that the funniest thing you ever saw? Look at his ears.
Hey, guys, lookit!
Smitty's an elephant!
- Aw, let me see!
- Boo!
- You can't hide him from us.
- Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.
- Come on!
- We wanna see him!
- We wanna laugh.
- Sure, that's what we came for.
Hey, the biggest slingshot in the world.
- Hey! Cut that out!
- Hey, let's get out of here.
- You're hurting me! Help!
- Here, you! What's going on?
Down. Mrs Jumbo, down!
Surround her. Tie her down.
Get down!
Calm down! Tie her down!
Darling, it was so funny.
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.
Well, personally, I think she went a bit too far.
After all, one mustn't forget one is a lady.
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.
Oh, well, I suppose that's mother love.
But it's certainly no excuse for what she did.
Mother love might cover a multitude of sins.
It's true, my dear, and she has such a streak in...
A guy can't eat in peace.
Yes, but mother love does...
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossipin'.
Girls, girls! Listen!
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.
Well, I heard today that they have put her in solitary confinement.
- No!
- You don't mean it!
Oh, how awful for her!
Well, I-I must say,
I-I don't blame her for anything.
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little...
F-R-E-A-K.
Yes, him with those ears that only a mother could love.
What's the matter with his ears?
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.
Don't forget that we elephants have always walked with dignity.
His disgrace is our own shame.
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat at the same bale of hay with him.
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.
- I should say.
- Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.
Here he comes now.
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.
Shh.
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.
Poor little guy.
There he goes, without a friend in the world.
Nobody to turn to.
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.
A mouse!
So ya like to pick on little guys, huh?
Well, why don't you pick on me?
A proud race.
Overstuffed hay bags!
Boo!
Still afraid of a mouse.
Ho-ho, boy.
Wait'll I tell the little guy.
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.
You can come out now.
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.
Come on out, won't ya?
You're not really afraid of little me, are ya?
Ya are?
Must've overdid it in there.
Don't know my own strength sometimes.
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Ya gotta come out first.
Too bad ya don't trust me,
'cause I thought... uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we might get your mother out of the clink.
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't be interested. So long, Dumbo.
Well, that's more like it.
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.
She's just broken-hearted.
It ain't nobody's fault you got them big ears.
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.
You know, lots of people with big ears are famous.
Ho-ho, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.
Make ya a star. A headliner!
Dumbo the Great!
Uh-oh. The great what?
Ya know, Dumbo, we gotta get an idea.
Not just any idea.
Something colossal, like, uh...
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!
Huh. He never had an idea in his life.
Just visualize:
One elephant climbs up... on top of another elephant until finally... all 17 elephants... have constructed an enormous pyramid... of pachyderms.
I step out.
I blow the whistle.
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.
- Yeah.
- And now... comes the climax!
Yeah? What is the climax?
Hmm. I don't know.
I knew he never had nothin'.
Well, maybe it comes to me... in a vision while I dream.
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.
Climax.
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.
I am the voice of your subconscious mind.
Your inspiration.
Now, concentrate.
Remember?
Your pyramid of elephants... are standing in the ring waitin' for a climax.
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.
- Climax.
- How's the reception?
Comin' through okay? Good.
Suddenly, from the sidelines, comes your climax.
- Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard... to a platform.
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid, he waves a flag... for a glorious finish!
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?
The little elephant with the big ears!
The world's mightiest midget mastodon! Dumbo!
What?
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.
I got it! I got it!
Ladies and gentlemen... we will now present for your entertainment... the most stupendous, magnificent... super-colossal spectacle.
On this tiny... little, insignificant ball... we will construct for you... a pyramid, not of wood, not of stone...
To hear him talk, you'd think he was going to do it.
- But a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.
Pyramid of ponderous, pulsating... pulchritudinous pachyderms!
I give you the elephants.
Aren't we a bit clumsy?
Gaining a little weight, aren't you, honey?
You're no cream puff yourself, dearie.
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.
Take your foot out of my eye, clumsy ox.
Steady, girls.
Boy, that was a close one.
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.
Okay, okay.
Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.
Now, look. All ya gotta do is run out, see?
Jump on the springboard.
All right, now show me just how you're gonna do it.
That's it. Attaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!
Oh, those ears.
We gotta do somethin', quick.
Ladies and gentlemen... you have now seen the impossible... accomplished in front of your faces.
Seven jungle giants... each one weighing not...
That windbag!
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!
And now, I present... the world's smallest little elephant... who will spring from this springboard... in one spring... to the top of this pyramid, waving his little flag... for a grand climax!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you Dumbo!
Go on! Get goin'!
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!
You're on, Dumbo.
Out of my way, assassin!
- Dear!
- Ohh.
I never thought I'd live to see the big top fall.
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!
I'd just like to spank the daylights out of him...
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.
They fixed him good.
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him...
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!
Made him a clown.
A clown?
- No!
- Yes.
Oh, the shame of it.
Let us take the solemn vow.
From now on, he is no longer... an elephant.
Please! Help me save my poor baby!
Whoo! Save my child!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where are you? Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Save my ba...
- Come on! Jump!
- We'll save you. Hurry up!
- Hurry up!
- We'll save you. Go on.
- Jump!
- We'll save ya.
Whew! Boy, oh, boy, did we wow 'em out there!
- What a performance!
- Are we good?
Thirteen curtain calls.
Thirteen!
Yeah, sure brought down the house, all right.
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.
You said it.
We rolled 'em in the aisles.
- Boy, oh, boy, what a act.
- Oh, "what a act" is right.
Stupendous, I calls it.
They'll have more respect for us clowns now.
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.
- Dumbo!
- Here's plaster in his eyes.
See? They're drinkin' a toast to ya.
Yeah. You're a big hit.
Why, uh, you're terrific.
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.
Come on. Alley-oop.
I gotta wash behind your ears.
You oughta be proud.
You're a success.
Look. A peanut!
Come on. Eat it.
Got lots of vitamins.
Give ya a lot of, uh, pep.
Oh-ho-ho.
I forgot to tell ya.
Why, we're goin' over to see your mother.
I made an appointment for ya.
Didn't I tell ya? Huh!
Just like me. I must have forgot.
Come on. Get your hat.
Oh. Right over there.
Cosy little place, ain't it?
Mrs Jumbo. I hope she's in.
Someone to see ya.
Baby mine
Don't you cry
Baby mine
Dry your eyes
Rest your head
Close to my heart
Never to part
Baby of mine
Little one
When you play
Don't you mind

Cute as can be baby of mine
Baby mine
Baby mine
Here ya are.
Pour it in me slipper, Joey.
Boy, I can't get over the way we rolled 'em in the aisles.
- Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.
Let's raise the platform the elephant jumps off of.
Yeah! If they laugh when he jumps 20 feet... they'll laugh twice as hard if he jumps 40 feet.
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.
Hey, hey!
Let's hit him for a raise.
Yeah, sure.
This is worth real dough.
Oh, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
Yes, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny
We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
I know how ya feel, Dumbo, but you gotta pull yourself together.
What would your mother think of ya, if she saw you crying like this?
Remember, you come of a proud race.
Why you're a-a-a... a pachyderm... and pachyderms don't cry.
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.
There. Ya see?
Well, ain't nothin' a little water won't cure.
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya fixed up in a jiffy.
Come on.
Here. Take a trunk full.
Listen, little fella.
We may have had a lot of hard luck up till now... but you and me is gonna do big things together.
Hold your breath. Why, your mother's gonna be so proud of ya.
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.
The whole circus is gonna be proud of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?
Swallow it.
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.
Oh, I guess you had one little one left over.
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha...
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What kind of water is this, anyhow?
Balloonies.
Hiya, George.
Whee!
That's a pretty schstrick schlick.
All right. Let's see ya blow a square one, pal.
Say, that's very, very clever.
Now blow a great big one.
That's a pretty sh... Hey!
Dumbo.
You see what I see?
Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade
Here they come
Hippity-hoppity
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere
Look out, look out
They're walking around the bed on their head
Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid
Pink elephants on parade
- What'll I do
- What'll I do
What an unusual view
I can stand the sight of worms and look at microscopic germs
But Technicolour pachyderms is really too much for me
I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seein'things you know there ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright
What a sight
Chase 'em away, chase 'em away
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade
- Hey, hey, hey
- Pink elephants
Pink elephants
Pink elephants
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.
Why, this is most irregular.
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.
Or do they?
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?
Come on.
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?
What's the good news?
What's fryin', boy?
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.
Yeah. Find out what they're doin' up here.
- Yeah.
- And "ax" them what they want.
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.
Ohh! Those pink elephants.
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!
What's so funny? What are you boys doin' down here, anyway?
What are we doin' down here?
Well, hear him talk.
Go on.
Fly up a tree where you belong.
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?
Now listen. I ain't your brother and I ain't no rat, see?
Uh-huh. And I suppose you... and no elephant ain't up in no tree, either.
No! No, me and no tree ain't up no... Huh?
Tree?
Yo!
Dumbo.
Dumbo. Wake up.
Wake up, Dumbo!
Don't look now, but I think we're up in a tree.
Aw, don't pay no attention to them scarecrows.
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.
So long, boy!
But I wonder how we ever got up in that tree, anyway.
Now, let's see.
Elephants can't climb trees, can they?
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.
The very things that held ya down are gonna carry ya up and up and up!
I can see it all now.
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder of the Universe!
The world's only flyin' elephant!
Did you ever see an elephant fly?
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!
See, I've seen all that too.
I've seen a peanut stand and heard a rubber band.
I seen a needle that winked its eye.
But I be done seen about ever'thing
When I see a elephant fly
- What'd you say, boy?
- I said when I see a elephant fly
I seen a front porch swing heard a diamond ring
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie
But I be done seen

But I be done seen

Bo Sho Ba-da-do-do
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing
When I see a elephant fly
With the wind.
When I see a elephant
Fly
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.
Quiet, gentlemen.
The Reverend Rodent is gonna address you.
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
A bunch of big guys like you... pickin' on a poor little orphan like him.
Suppose you was torn away from your mother when you was just a baby... nobody to tuck you in at nights... no warm, soft, caressin' trunk to snuzzle into.
How would you like to be left out alone... in a cold, cruel, heartless world?
And why? I ask ya, why?
Just because he's got those big ears, they call him a freak.
The laughing stock of the circus.
Then when his mother tried to protect him... they threw her into the clink.
And on top of that, they made him a clown!
Socially, he's washed up.
Ah, but what's the use of talkin' to you cold-hearted birds?
Go ahead. Have your fun.
Laugh at him.
Kick him, now that he's down.
Go on!
We don't care.
Come on, Dumbo.
Hey, brother, w-w-wait a minute.
Uh, don't go away feelin' like that.
We done seen the light.
You boys is okay.
Please, you've done enough.
Well, but we's all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.
You wanna make the elephant fly, don't ya?
Well, you gotta use a lot of'chology.
You know, psychology.
Now, here's what you do.
First, you, uh...
Uh, bu...
And then, right after that, you, uh...
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?
The magic feather?
Yeah, I gotcha.
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!
The magic feather!
Now you can fly!
Let's go. Let's go.
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.
- Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.
- One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.
Faster, faster.
Get up flyin' speed.
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.
Take off.
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.
I guess it's just another one of their... Look!
Hot diggity! You're flyin'.
You're flyin'!
Uh, why, he flies just like a eagle.
That's better than a aeroplane.
Brother, now I've seen everything.
But I be done seen about everything
When I see a elephant fly
With the wind.
When I see a elephant
Fly
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!
Wait'll we get to the big town.
Boy, them city folks is sure in for a surprise.
Poor baby! Whoo!
- Come on! Jump! Come on!
- We'll save ya.
- Hurry up!
- We'll save ya!
- Come on! Jump!
- Come on!
Look at that house.
Dumbo, you're standing on the threshold of success.
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Ho-ho.
Got the magic feather? Good.
Okay. Contact!
Take off!
Uh-oh. The magic feather!
Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly.
Honest, you can.
Hurry! Open 'em up!
Please!
Whee! We did it! We did it!
Let's show 'em, Dumbo.
Power dive.
Now, loop the loop.
You're makin' history!
I've seen a peanut stand heard a rubber band
I've seen a needle that winked its eye
But I be done seen
About everything
When I see an elephant fly
- Oh, my

Oh, man, I got his autograph.
Well, so long, glamour boy!

Hey, yeah. The 1960's?
Happy times, heavy times.
All right, so you get your daughter, right?
She might be Catholic,
Jewish, anything.
So you bring her up in what they call... the bourgeois,
American-type-society family.
Bring them up so they don't screw until they get married.
You take them to church on Sunday.
Teach them all you can about bringing up a family... how you should look and act... then you send them to college.
You bust your hump.
No government subsidy.
Nobody's paying nothing.
You save your money, or you borrow the money... you work overtime, you send her to college.
You want her to get an education.
The first Easter she comes home on a vacation... she says, "Hey, Dad,
I'm living with some guy."
"You're living with some guy?
What do you mean?"
"This is the thing now.
Free love."
We're getting away from the original point.
What we're trying to find is, why are these bastards rioting?
Because they did dope.
Listen, you're going in the wrong direction.
What of it?
What happens is, look,
I'm sending you to school...
I'm breaking my ass to send you to college, right?
I expect you're going to learn something.
Why be a janitor?
Learn something.
To justify my investment in you.
But some of these people revel in the fact... that their kids are leaders, are rabble-rousers.
This son of a bitch just started a riot.
These kids think they're the first generation... that ever screwed before they got married.
We all did, but we always had one girl.
She screwed... that girl you took out.
It's better off these kids don't get married... because they haven't got the guts to stick with it.
Hey, you fucking intellectuals
You think you're so where it's at
Before you fill your minds with any junk
Better listen to Fritz the Cat
'Cause writers and poets and artists
It's your duty to live life to the most
So fly out, brothers, and check out the world
Give me a ride to the coast
Fritz the Cat
He fought many a good man
Laid many a good woman
Live life to the fullest
Cry out for more until it bleeds
Help me, help me help you, mother...
Love me,
I hate you, love me
I kill you, love me
I love you
What a mob in the park today.
God, the place is crawling with phonies.
Yeah, high school punks.
Those creeps are always here on weekends, man.
Most of them are total jackoffs.
So many people here and nobody here.
-Dig that chick, man!
-Over there?
Man, look at that ass on her!
-What a baby carriage.
-So what, man?
If you hadn't showed up so late, we'd be all right now.
Fritz always does it, man.
Everybody's here with their guitars already.
Sixteen versions of "Lemon Tree."
I just want someplace where I can sleep.
I mean, I can cook.
I can sew and do housework and things like that.
Get out the guitars.
Come on, get them out.
And one, two, three.
Once I had a little girl
Who was in love with me
Well, well, baby,
I know, I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, mama, mama, singing it, ho
Dumb chicks.
-Easily impressed by spades.
-lt's the thing, man.
Look, I'm gonna split.
I'll see you guys later.
Yeah, hang loose, Fritz.
I've read everything
James Baldwin's written.
He has a true sense of the problems of black people.
I worked for Head Start for free last summer.
Black kids are so much groovier.
I went to a couple of
Black Panther meetings.
The time for non-violent revolution is past.
More power to the people!
I'm taking a course in African studies at school.
I had no idea you people were so civilized.
Do you know that property values... actually go up when a black family moves in?
Freud didn't write for the black man.
Why does a great actor like James Earl Jones... always have to play black men?
Don't you hate it when people say "Colored" or "Negro"... and not "Black"?
Black is beautiful.
It's so great that black people wear their hair natural... not emulating the image of beauty... white people inflict upon them.
I had a black girlfriend once who said that Jewish people... were the closest to black people.
I'm Jewish, you know.
I ain't no jive-ass black nigger, honey.
Who do you think I am?
Geraldine?
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus!
How awful.
My soul is tormented.
-Gee.
-Oh, no.
I've been up and down the four corners of this big old world.
I've seen it all!
I've done it all!
-Gee.
-Wow.
I've fought many a good man, laid many a good woman.
I've had riches and fame and adventure.
Stood face to face with danger and death countless times.
Are you somebody famous?
I think I saw you in a movie once.
Try not to interrupt, huh?
I've tasted life to the fullest... and still my soul cries out... in this hungry, tortured, wrecked quest, "More!"
-Look at the good side of life.
-Things aren't all bad.
Gee, he's handsome.
You. You can help me.
You must save me.
By so doing, you, too, will be saved.
I'd like to, but what can I do?
Lovely set of eyes there.
Little sweet one with your heart of gold...
I know of a place where we can be alone... to join our souls in sacred truth.
I want to be in on this thing.
What about my soul, you fink?
Four in bed...that's a kick
I haven't tried yet.
What?
Yes. Together we shall all learn... the real existential essence of the life force.
"Existential."
I heard that word once.
-What's it mean?
-"Cool," stupid.
You are a true genius, Fritz.
Wild, this is wild.
Oh, honey, I could go...
I'll get it. God damn it.
What's happening, man?
Fritz the Cat has become the stud of the year.
We're having a session here now, so I don't know.
Anybody using that room?
That's the john,
I mean... if you're really strung out, man.
We'll take it.
This way, group.
Come along, now, step lively.
Watch your step.
That's a girl.
Rub-a-dub-a-dub.
OK.
A new world of experience awaits us, my loves.
This bathtub is now transformed... into a space capsule of truth and love.
Wow! This is wild!
Only in naked closeness can we all know each other.
Yes! Right!
Very good, Winston, darling.
"Naked closeness," true.
You are a perceptive girl.
Closeness, we must all get very close... as close as possible, as a matter of fact.
That's right.
Let's all get close together.
Oh, boy.
Closeness and fulfillment of our hidden desires... through which we reach the truth.
Fulfillment is important.
Don't you think so, Winston?
Ooh, yes.
Very important.
Now I'm getting to the truth,
I think, yes.
It's all very clear now.
OK, Winston.
Here come the truth.
You got the word.
Oh, Fritzy.
You got such an existential little body.
Jeez. Wow.
Oh, shit!
Maybe we better go, huh?
No! Not at all!
You get down over here.
And you down like that.
Right under here.
Watch the foot.
Right under here.
Ready, everyone.
Here we go.
Hey, Ralph,
I think this is the place... we got the report on with these kids upstairs... doing the shit and smoking,
I think.
Tell me what to do.
I never went in before.
Because you're a rookie and this is your first beat... you just follow me.
We walk up the steps.
We don't make any noise.
You follow me slowly, got that?
I do. Like Dick Tracy.
No, it's like
Terry and the Pirates.
Dick Tracy's old hat.
Now, let's go inside.
Wait. Could I get to search the girls?
Yeah.
I've done enough of that.
Here we go.
And watch me,
'cause I'm a natural in action.
Up the steps.
Hey, man.
What the hell's going on in here?
For Christ's sake, what do you want?
For Christ's sake...
Fritz is having his own private little orgy.
Move over, man.
Will you get out of here?
We're seeking the truth!
It's my bathtub, man.
Don't pay attention to that Fritz.
He got a Jesus complex.
Oh, I know it.
Have some joy puff, sweet little bird.
Hello, New York.
Heard you're having a hash session here.
Wow, this is where it's at.
Yes, man, come join us.
Good stuff and lots of it, man.
Only close the door.
We're modest.
Har har har.
The guy's a riot.
Oh, God, I'm there.
You really there?
How is it?
-lt's...
-How is it?
That's funny.
I'm not there anymore.
Oh, shit.
I'm a writer.
Let's talk about it.
Ever made it with an aardvark before?
It's a rare opportunity.
We're scarce.
Really?
I can't tell if I'm there or not.
How do you tell?
You'll know when you are.
Oh, balls. lt doesn't work for me.
I'm a failure as a pot smoker.
Don't be sad.
Someday you'll make it.
Really.
Shh. I think we're here.
Do you hear anything, Ralph?
It sounds like a bunch of degenerates in there.
Now, listen, Ralph, you got the deeper voice.
And I want you to yell,
"Open the fucking door."
Say the word "Fucking" because that makes you sound tough.
When I say three, you yell, "Open..."
I'm even gonna ad-lib.
No ad-libbing, Ralph.
Let me call them pre-verts.
What's a pre-vert?
A pre-vert is a degenerate, didn't you know that?
A pre-vert's a degenerate?
Didn't you have no bringing up?
I got bar-mitzvahed.
You ain't supposed to laugh, Ralph!
This is a serious job and we're getting paid for it.
Cut the fucking shit out.
Let's go.
All right.
Open up in there!
It's the law! Hippie bastards!
Good, Ralph, do it again.
What the fuck's your problem?
Cut it out!
I won't laugh!
Open the door, you pre-verts!
Open up!
Law and order's here!
-Open up!
-All right in there!
Open up! Here we are!
Wow! I can do it!
Oh, baby, do I feel high!
I'm flying!
What a wonderful, wiggly world!
We're outside, but we'll get in!
-Law and order's here!
-Open up!
All right in there!
Your fucking bath party's over!
-Over here!
-The cops!
Right in the mouth!
Yeah! I love it!
Take that!
Hey, you!
Get your hands out of my thing!
-Here we are!
-Where the fuck are you?
Over there! ln the head!
Get your hands off of my dick!
In the head!
I love it! I love it!
Ralph, where are you?
Ralph, help! Gotcha!
Now I gotcha!
Here, take that!
That's my...
Gotcha! ln the heart!
In the head!
Over there!
Watch that thing!
Where's the cat?
Wow.
Hey, look at this big fucking gun.
I killed the john!
Kill! Destroy!
Can you give him your glasses?
Because I can't.
I have to look.
-You can't see?
-l'll give them back.
A little bit...
Oh, boy, this is good for me.
Can you dig it in your eyes?
You're younger than me.
Forty-five, forty-eight.
I'm sixty-seven.
I wish I knew.
I would give you glasses.
I'd take another pair from the house.
I didn't think
I would need the glasses.
I'm not so young no more, remember.
You don't see nothing?
I'm older than you are,
I'll see.
I'll mention that I see.
You're doing fine.
You're doing fine.
You know something?
That you don't have to look at the book, right?
So say it. Say it.
All right.
All right. Good.
-Good.
-Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.
Just normal.
You know, nice and quiet.
Now, wait a minute.
Don't rush.
Mother of God,
I'm a fucking fugitive.
This is the place!
I saw him come in here!
Oh, my God, it's a synagogue.
What kind of a place is this?
A church?
Listen, I can hear them.
Don't sound like English.
Are they Puerto Ricans?
Ralph, you're trying my patience.
You go down that aisle,
I'll go down this aisle.
It's about time you said something bright.
Ralph, please be quiet.
It's my people.
-Excuse me, Rabbi.
-They all got long hair.
-Sorry, Rabbi.
-They all got long clothes.
-Excuse me.
-Must be a hippie church.
Hi, Rabbi.
Did you see him?
God.
Ralph, would you please shut up?
I ain't talking loud.
Excuse me, Rabbi.
Hi, Ma.
Excuse me, Rabbi.
Uncle Ben, how are you?
I'm catching a criminal.
Excuse me, Rabb...
It's you.
Did you find him?
No, he was over there, but...
-But I was just telling you...
-Cut it out!
But I was just...
I ain't talking loud!
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
You saved my life!
We interrupt the lsraeli-Arab war... for this special announcement.
The president, after conferring... with the lsraeli prime minister Golda Meir... has agreed to send more arms and equipment to lsrael... based on the return of
New York City and Los Angeles... to the United States.
Mazel tov! Mazel tov!
Stop, you motherfucking cat!
Stop in the name of the law!
Stop!
Stupid, Ralph, you're not supposed to dance.
But I didn't want to break the circle!
-You're not supposed to dance.
-l got musical feet.
You dumb rookie.
Dumb rookie!
You dumb rookie!
Dumb rookie!
You're not supposed to dance, Ralph...
'cause you're not Jewish!
I had a great thing going till the frigging fuzz showed up.
I wish that skinny broad didn't turn on the shower, too.
I think I'm getting a cold.
Hello, men. Everybody studying for their goddamn exams?
Hey, Buzz, how'd it go with that Dee-Dee chick?
She's got some bod, you have to admit.
Charlene isn't bad, either, though, right?
Like wow!
Hines!
You swine, old buddy pig!
You groove behind Alvina, get some kicks tonight?
Bastards.
You'd think the goddamn exams... was the be-all and end-all of existence... cosmic life force or something.
You'd think they were the frigging fugitives.
Can't even get in a few decent words to a guy.
Bastards.
What a bore, they just sit there... and take bennies and stay up all night... with their face stuck in a bunch of books... and their thumb up their ass.
Yes, yes,
I remember the time... when it was all very inspiring and enlightening... all this history and literature and sociology shit.
You think learning is a really big thing... and you become this big fucking intellectual... and sit around trying to out-intellectual... all the other big fucking intellectuals.
You spend years and years... with your nose buried in these goddamn tomes... while the world is passing you by.
All the stuff to see... and all the kicks... and all the girls are out there.
And me, a writer!
And a poet who should be having adventures... and experiencing all the diversities... and paradoxes and ironies of life... and passing over all the roads of the world!
And digging all the cities and towns and rivers... and the oceans and... making all of them chicks.
Oh, God.
As a writer and a poet... it is my duty to get out there and dig the world... to swim in the whole frigging scene... while there is still time, man.
My farting around days are over, baby.
From this day on, I shall live every day as if it was my last.
I must do it!
No more of the dreary, boring classes... dismal lectures, sitting around bullshitting.. with pretentious fat-ass hippies.
No more of the books... the spoutings of a bunch of old farts... who think they know the whole goddamn score.
Oh, my God, what have I done?
I set all my notes and books on fire... and now I can't study for my exams.
I'll flunk out, and my folks will be pissed off.
I'll get a blanket.
The blanket's on fire.
We better call the fire department.
Bo Diddley buy his baby a diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
He gonna take it to a private eye
If that private eye can't see
He better not take that ring from me
Bo Diddley caught him a nanny goat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday coat
Bo Diddley caught him a bear cat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday hat
Maybe someday
You will fall in love
As I fell in love with you
Baby
The one you love
Just keep falling in love with you
Then when
You all alone
You know it'd be best, baby
You can sing like that.
Little coquette, I love you
Sing, 'cause I want to... if I get tired, I quit.
But you don't want to sing.
I want to sing, man.
I'm good.
You sing as good as you want.
If I get tired, I quit.
I went to school in Oakland... and I had quite a few white-type of school kids with me.
I'm forty-nine.
At that time, I had white kids going to school with me.
I would have peanut butter.
I don't want it... but I ate so much when my mother gave it to me.
With apple butter.
I got two cans of it now.
That I don't eat because... whitey was eating ham sandwiches... and I was eating peanut butter sandwiches.
Sandwiches!
I got to get out of this town for some Southern times.
Let me out of here.
That's right.
Suck! The bus only cost
$17 to New York.
I say, "l ain't made
$17 in two weeks."
Got air to live.
Riding a ship coming out of Pearl Harbor.
And all my white friends... then we drank water out of the ditches.
If I had a K-ration,
I gave them some of it.
And...
I would ride this bus.
I couldn't sit with my friend on this bus at Houston, Texas.
I had to ride at the back end of this bus.
I'm about to get hot now.
As a matter of fact... you couldn't even go no place down South riding a bus.
Couldn't even get a soda... walk in there and get you a sandwich.
I don't give a damn about who's racist.
I just want equality.
Be equal with the next guy, because I'm paying my taxes.
That's a different thing now.
I'm a working man, and I'm paying my taxes.
The money is what's happening.
See what I mean?
It all counts... when is what's happening.
I'm talking about...
If you want to be revolutionary... you get some bread first, and then you can talk trash.
Whitey blind us with religion.
If you fight violence with violence... like the late Malcolm did, you'll get some results.
Right.
Because before this rioting and shit... you didn't have no Head Start programs for kids.
You didn't have shit!
Really.
You didn't have a goddamn thing.
Got you down in Harlem selling horsemeat.
You know, if one of them motherfuckers... down and out selling horsemeat, they dead.
Another civil war.
Civil war.
And I'm gonna be standing back...
"Get 'em, baby!"
Hey, man, you in a bag?
Yeah, that's it.
I'm in a bag.
Just don't lose your coolness, cat...
I mean, don't lose your coolness.
Easy for you to talk.
You're a crow.
I wish I was a crow.
If I was a crow,
I'd fly away, man.
I'd fly away from this miserable town for good.
You think being a crow is a big motherfucking ball?
All you cats the same, man.
You don't know where it is.
There's nobody to tell you where it's at.
And you come up here, try to find out where it's at... but you got to be up here, man, to find out what's happening.
I know it isn't a ball, man.
I studied the race problems.
I know.
You don't know nothing about the race problem.
Got to be a crow to know about the race problem.
You know what I mean?
Do you dig where I'm at?
You know what I'm talking about?
Man, this thing affects me very deeply, fella.
As a cat, I have a considerable guilt complex... because my kind have always brought suffering on your kind.
Yes, indeed, my soul is tortured and tormented... by this racial crisis.
No shit?
I kid you not, man.
Sometimes I really get hung up about it.
You know, uptight.
-Strung out.
-ln a bag?
Yeah, in a bag!
I'm gonna buy you a drink, cat.
Just 'cause I think you got coolness.
Great.
Hey, boy, can I have a drink?
Oh, man!
Hey, Duke!
Hey, Duke!
They's blowing pot like mad up in Mildred's pad!
I'm on my way, man.
Hey, cat, how would you like to bug out now?
By God, man!
I'm gonna bug out!
Did he say bug out, baby?
Go ahead, baby, bug out.
Ain't no bug out.
-What kind of shit is that?
-lt's a bug out to him.
-lt's some kind of dance.
-Let's split.
Anybody looking our way?
Some stud gone and left his keys.
What are you doing?
You stealing that car?
Shove over, Jack!
Let me drive this goddamn thing.
Move it out!
Hey, man, you cats can't drive.
You don't know nothing about nothing.
Can't you see that car go by?
Cool it, will you?
I drive like a crow.
-Man, look, slow down!
-l see the light.
Man, you'll get killed up here!
Bullshit, Ralph!
Would you please shut up?
It's bad enough we got transferred up here... without you bullshitting all night.
Now, I gotta cover my beat... and I'll meet you back here in an hour.
One hour, Ralph.
And, Ralph... please, be careful.
Yeah, but Harlem?
Come on, slow the car down!
Look out, man!
I ain't ready to die yet!
Harlem?
I know what I'm doing.
The only faces... you can see in a crowd up here is ours.
The way they look, all you can see is their eyes.
I don't like it here.
I see the fucking fuzz.
Cool it, just cool it.
Right through the head
I'm gonna get you!
Throw that pig out!
Look out!
Cool it, man, will you?
I know what I'm doing.
Like hell you do.
Duke, you saved my life, man!
Shit!
Yesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance
And love
Then gay youth was mine
And truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Them-sooth was mine
Sad am l
Glad am l
For today
I'm dreaming of
Yesterdays
That you, Sonny?
It's me, baby.
-How's the crowd tonight?
-Not bad.
We're pushing enough grass to make our money.
Just enough.
But it sure ain't like the good old days in Harlem... when white money was boss... and them fine, white cats came up to Harlem... spreading it all around
Big Bertha.
Oh, child.
That was before all those peace marches... sit-ins, riots, and 'dos.
Ain't nothing wrong with no peace marches.
It's me, baby.
Who's that joker?
Friend of mine.
Cat, you ever been high on pot?
Are you kidding me, man?
Grass?
Who doesn't, you know?
What do you think,
I'm some kind of a hick?
Let's get that cat going on pot!
Take one.
That's what
I'm talking about, baby.
Nothing wrong, take two.
Come on, be a club member.
That's it!
Take three! Take four!
Five, six, seven!
That's it, baby!
He ain't losing now, no, indeed.
Joint, Hilly! A joint!
Stay loose!
Fritz, come on, now, stop!
Yo, Fritz!
Fritz, come on, now, stop it!
No, don't stop! Oh, yeah!
Oh, no, Fritz! Come on!
Hey, toro!
Hully gully cat!
Climb, sugar!
Right there! No, Fritz!
Come on, Fritz!
Aw, man, yeah!
Will you look at that?
You ain't black enough, hon.
That old black magic got me!
Oh, Fritz! That's right!
Right there, honey!
Wow, wow, wow!
Pump that thing!
Suddenly it's all very clear!
I must tell the people about the revolution!
Revolt! Revolt!
Damn you! What the hell you jabbering about now?
Revolt!
Revolt! Revolt!
Revolt, you thick-skulled idiots!
You have carried heavy burdens for the bosses!
You have sweat your lives away for the bosses!
The bosses!
They ride around in limousines!
Get the fuck off my car!
Bosses...they're eating strawberries and cream !
That's funny!
Cats are real boss!
All right, what's going on here?
Break it up!
Cool it, officer.
He's just blowing hot air.
No one's paying no mind.
Come the revolution, there'll be no more limousines!
Come the revolution, no more strawberries and cream !
Hey, Ralph, you know how these dumb kids are.
They don't know what they doing.
Fucking "A" right.
There he is!
He's the one who keeps the bosses in power!
He's the one who's holding you down!
-Who, me?
-You!
-Not me. You.
-No, you!
-Me?!
-Not me!
You!
-Fuck you!
-You first!
The spiked Buddha Capitalism !
The iron thumb on the heads of the proletariat!
They're gonna kill us.
Would you like to see a picture of my kids?
Come on, man!
You'll get killed up here!
Get them, get them !
Kill them !
We shall overcome!
Group Commander to Formation B.
Don't give them a chance to scatter.
Attack all congested areas.
I've got to find him.
Where could he be?
This is the alley behind that place he was standing at.
It gives me the creeps.
Good evening, madam.
Oh, Fritz!
Thank God I found you.
Join me, Winston, my love.
It's not very pretty looking, but it's cozy as a bitch.
Fritz, come out of there, will you please?
The hell! With the fuzz combing the city for me?
Has my picture appeared on TV yet?
Have they broadcast an alarm?
Offered a reward for information leading to my arrest?
Don't be so melodramatic.
You and your illusions of grandeur.
I'm not getting in that filthy, grimy garbage can with you.
Go fuck yourself.
You're such a child.
Such a self-centered, egotistical child.
This is disgusting.
If you're gonna talk about my garbage can that way... just get the hell out.
Fritz, are you still going to bug out or not?
Are you kidding, toots?
I got no choice at this point.
Listen to me, will you?
I've got a car and some money.
I can get all the things we need... and we can leave right away.
We can go out to the coast.
I'll get a good job as a private secretary... and you can work on your poetry and all.
We can get married and rent a nice little pad in Frisco... and dig the scene out there.
It's supposed to be a great town.
Frisco. Yeah, OK.
She makes men into boys
She makes giants into men
She'll have you feeling guilty
Before you can count to ten
Poor Winston
Sharp mind and a body to match
Poor Winston
Fine fancy karma, able, too, at that
Who is the girl in the fiberglass shorts?
Well, it's got to be
Winston Schwartz
You can't outtalk her
'Cause she talks too fast
You can't outthink her, she's a New York flash
She makes love to you and tell you you're in love
You make love to her
She says you don't know how to do it
Poor Winston at last we're zooming down that old lonesome highway.
It's wild.
Yeah. Marvelous.
Marvelous, my ass!
It's exalting. Elating.
The cool night wind blowing past the window. Man!
I'm hungry.
Let's stop someplace.
The hell with stopping.
I just want to feel those miles flying by.
I'm hungry!
Let's dig one of those little greasy truck stops.
I'd like to talk with those truck drivers, you know?
Hear what they got to say about life on the road.
I bet they got wild stories of the road.
Drivers, trucks, hijackers!
Fights! Let's do it.
Here's a good place.
I'll have your deluxe steak with salad and coffee. Black.
All right.
What would you like, sir?
That was really a fine steak.
You can always depend upon Howard Johnson's.
Let's get back on the road.
Goddamn.
Fritz! Wake up!
Huh? What?
The car is broken down... and I can't get the damned thing...
What? Where are we?
Fuck a duck.
We're out in the middle of the frigging desert.
Jesus, it's great!
Exactly. You've been sound asleep for two days.
-What?
-Two days.
You must've been dragged out after your big binge.
Shit. I guess I was.
All that drinking and blowing pot and screwing, man.
Man, I get horny just thinking about it.
Like, wow!
Start thinking about fixing this car, Fritz... or we'll be sitting here forever.
Look, is something bugging you, pal?
The car won't go!
Well, let's have a look.
I knew that all the time.
The engine's not up here.
It's in the back.
Let's just check it out.
What's wrong?
Let me see, I'll just...
If I move that...no...
What's wrong, Fritz?
It's all very complicated,
Winston.
I couldn't begin to explain it.
I think the piston rod's stuck in the drive shaft.
Either that, or the carburetor is rusted out.
Oh, good God.
Here comes a pickup truck.
Maybe he'll give us a push to the next gas station.
What's the trouble, buddy?
Our car is busted down.
Could you give us a push to the next gas station?
Let me look at it.
One thing I'm good at is fixing things.
Shut up!
Please shut up, chickens!
Shut up!
Please shut up!
I mean, shut up!
One thing I'm good at... is fixing things.
Dumb chickens.
Let me see now.
Ain't nothing the matter with this car here.
Buddy, ain't you got any sense at all?
You just let your car run out of gas.
I swear, these motherfucking hippies from New York.
There's a gas station a couple of miles back.
I'm going this way.
You ought to stop for gas once in a while, you stupid...
Gotta keep your engine fed.
Wise up, buddy.
Well, how do you like that?
New York hippies come down here... and they think they can...
I never, honest and true.
You think a thing like that happens...
Son of a bitch.
You're so clever.
So clever.
Big mechanical genius.
Here's a bucket, smart guy.
Good luck.
Hey, this is for shit!
You made a big bourgeois deal out of everything... and ruined it completely.
I was gonna bug out and be free from all this bullshit... and roam around and dig everything... and really have a good time.
Your naivete is astounding.
You'd be completely lost without me, Fritz... and you know it.
You're a motherfucking bitch.
I see the hard facts of life.
I am realistic, something you're incapable of.
You'd be better off with one of those stupid morons... like Charlene, who you could sleep with and throw away.
You can't cope with a mature woman.
You haven't the faintest idea how lucky you are... that an intelligent woman... loves you and wants to give you something of value... something that will inflame your creative potential!
Now, get going and hurry up!
We'll see who gets lost without whom.
Fritz the Cat
Fritz the Cat
Fritz the Cat
I'm the envy of each and every guy in town
She looks so sharp, and the girl does, too
And everybody knows what I'm gonna do
Gonna take a ride on my bike
Gonna take it and drive all night
Tell my Chevy to take a hike
Take another ride on my bike
Blue, I'm crazy about you.
Penniless. A regular bum.
A hobo with no money and no place to go.
Hey, you old scroungy old alley cat.
Get out of them garbage cans.
You talking to me, Jack?
What the hell you doing there, anyway?
Man, here we are on the brink of the apocalypse... the eve of destruction, so to speak... and I can't think of anything to do.
Offhand, son,
I'd say you have got a problem.
But at least you're honest.
The revolution can use a man like you.
Hop on.
-Hello there.
-Hi.
-How are you?
-High.
I'll introduce you to the guys at the cell meeting.
Blue!
Glad you could make it, man.
Howdy, John. I brought along an old buddy of mine.
He's a bright lad but bored with life.
Fritz... this here is John... former biker and small-time hood... turned fighter for the cause.
That cat was a beautiful head.
Glad to meet you, man.
Another castout for the bourgeois view.
From the mold of bankrupt sedentary.
What's the state of his political consciousness?
Practically nil, I'm afraid.
Our shipment came in today.
Thirty-two survivors.
Go around.
Hey, chief.
Getting ready for a little action planned for tonight.
We're gonna paralyze the whole fucking city.
It's going to be great, man.
The shit is really gonna come down tonight.
We've got everything we need... for three synchronized sabotage actions.
The city will be ours.
The machinery of the establishment... will be in ruins by morning.
The government will fall without firing one goddamn shot.
The new mayor will resign... and we'll move in and set up a tribunal.
It's curtains.
Blue, honey, talk to me a minute.
Don't bother me.
I want to talk to you, honey.
Let's go.
Leave me the hell alone.
We'll go and get some chinks.
I'm so hungry.
I ain't hungry.
Don't turn off on me.
Besides...
I don't need that garbage.
Every time you're with your friends you don't pay...
You son of a bitch!
That hurt me, god damn it!
What do you think I am, a boxing ball?
A punching bag!
Hit her! Hit her!
You know what you guys are?
You're a bunch of closet fags.
Shut up!
And when I leave this place... you'll get together and screw one another.
That's nice.
That is nice.
See, she loves it.
I love it, too.
We've got a lot of lousy time to kill.
I think I'm gonna ride that goddamn horse.
Then go on, have a go.
You'll love it.
Let me ride that goddamn horse.
Get on with it.
You know what you are?
You're a bunch of fucking Nazi fags!
Guys, that's uncool.
Don't do that.
Listen, you son of a bitch.
You lousy...
Cut it out.
You're hurting her!
You maniacs!
What are you doing to her?
Go ahead and hit me!
My God, my God!
I can't take it anymore!
This isn't working out, Blue.
Our relationship stinks.
Come on, Harriet.
Let's go inside. lt's cold.
I have to go to bed by day.
Come on inside, baby.
You'll get hurt out here.
Listen, I tried to stop them, but l...
Come on, Fritz!
Wait a minute, huh?
John says this night will mean... a great leap forward for America's social evolution.
I dig it.
We're gonna blow up the power plant.
This will keep you warm.
I gotta go.
Hey, baby.
We all had a good time and got our rocks off.
Now we must devote ourselves to the great task before us.
What'd you have to hit her so hard for?
She loved it.
Me and you have been assigned to blow up the power plant.
That's all I care about.
The revolution.
You're full of shit!
All you care about... is a reason to hurt, to destroy, to blow up.
You don't know what a real revolution is.
None of you sons of bitches do.
Harriet, well, she's good.
She's real. She loves.
She loves.
And when you get right down to it... that's where it's really at.
The love you give is equal to the love you get.
Well, fuck it.
I ain't doing it.
So long, Fritz.
I ain't planting this bomb for you schmucks.
Far out.
And though after my skin worms destroy this body... yet in my flesh shall I see God... whom I shall see for myself.
You gotta let us see our Fritz!
Where is he?
What have you done with him?
You can't go in there.
I'm sorry, girls.
He's under house arrest.
Let us see him ! Please!
-No one gets in.
-He's hurt.
Lord Jesus... and shalt believe in thine heart... that God hath raised Him from the dead.
I reckon he needed her.
He must be through.
Finished.
For with the heart... man believeth unto righteousness... and with the mouth... confession is made unto salvation.
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper... but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them... shall have mercy.
Fritz, we're so sorry, baby.
He's trying to say something.
I've been up and down... the four corners... of this big old world.
I've...seen it all... and I've done it all.
I've fought many a good man... and I've laid many a good woman.
And... if there's one thing
I've learned... it's...it's... you get over here... and you get down there like that...
Poor cat.
He was a... he was a tough kid at that, wasn't he?
Down the lane
They're strolling
Two by two
Holding hands
They smile like we used to do
Here with their one and only
I'd forgotten I was lonely
Oh, how I wish
That here were there with you
All the days of sadness
They seem so needless now
Yes, it's taken me
This long, long time
To see
It's clear
And my dreams
Keep drifting back to me
And our strolls
Beneath these same stars above
And when the leaves
Are falling
My heart will be recalling
You're the only girl
I ever really loved

This is it, Digipals.
In a few seconds, the doors will open for the best movie of all time.
A Digimon movie.
Seven hours of waiting in line and skipping breakfast...
...have finally paid off.
Nanette Manoir.
The end of the line starts at the end.
Au contraire, Angela Anaconda.
The end is for riffraff, which is French for:
Those who must wait since they don't have...
...all-access, VlP passes.
But thanks ever so for keeping our spot warm.
"Thanks for keeping our spot warm."
We are going to have to get digidrastic if we want to get the best seats.
Get ready to rumble.
Hey, wait up! I was first in line!
Saved!
Guys? Where are my best friends?
Refills are free, right?
Taken! Sorry! Saved! Back up, Grandma!
That's it!
If my friends do not get here soon--
Popcorn! Thanks, Johnny Abatti.
Digimon! Digimon!
We're about to have the best view of the best movie, in the best seats ever!
Hats, view, blocking!
S'il vous plait, Angela Anaconda.
As if we would ever be so gauche as to wear them in the actual theater.
Mrs. Brinks, we saved you a seat.
Enjoy the show, Angela Anaconda.
So Mrs. Brinks and Ninny-poo think they can block the Digimon show...
...with their big, fat,
Digimon-blocking heads, do they?
Well, not for long.
Angela Anaconda, digivolve to Angelamon!
Well, look who's here.
Ninnymon and her Brinksimonster robot...
...come to block our view of the entire world.
Prepare for battle, you pathetic Pukimon.
But first, let's make some concessions.
After all, refills are free. Right, Ginamon?
"Help me, Angelamon, more powerful
Digimon than l", you will cry.
Don't worry, Ninny-whinnymon.
My pal Johnnymon is here to give you a kick-start.
And now, get ready for my ultimate, anti-Ninnymon...
...super-secret powers.
Angela!
Angelamon! Angelamon!
Digimon!
-Digimon!
-Excusez-moi, but if you common...
...Iine waiters can't adhere to theater etiquette...
...then I'll be forced to summon an usher.
Oh, Guinevere, je t'aime depuis le premier jour.
I've loved you since the first day.
This isn't Digimon!
This is some boring, phony, fake French film.
But that means....
We're in the wrong theater.
I called dibs on the best seats!
Good heavens!
Who says,
"There's no such thing as monsters "?
You're never quite the same after you meet your first Digimon.
My name's Kari. I'm part of a team called the DigiDestined.
There were a handful of us at first, but we've added a few members since then.
That's me with T.K., another one of the DigiDestined.
And that's Willis, in America.
While the rest of us in Japan only had one Digimon, he had twins.
And while we had our team to count on...
... Willis didn't have any human friends, only his two Digimon.
His digital adventures, as well as ours, began that night, eight years ago.
Did you know there are actually two worlds?
Our world and the Digital World.
Now, don't plan a vacation there.
I'm not even sure where it is.
But when I first saw it, I was so scared,
I was so nervous, I was so cute.
That's my brother Tai, when he was a little kid.
Even back then, he was a born leader.
Brave, strong and graceful.
That night started like every other one.
Tai was making his fourth trip to the bathroom.
Kari, what are you doing in here?
You're not supposed to play with the computer.
But it's doing something weird.
I was right. It was our first DigiEgg.
On the other side of the world...
... Willis was getting his DigiEgg at the exact same time.
Tai, wake up!
Tai! I'm going to the health-food store.
What a weird dream. A computer egg?
I gotta stop watching scary movies before I go to bed.
Take care of your sister.
But, Mom,
I was gonna play soccer with my friends!
The egg's real!
I bet you this is gonna taste a lot better than your egg.
I know what we can do.
Let's use it as a soccer ball.
You're right, it probably wouldn't bounce that high.
If anyone asks where that weird-looking egg came from...
...Iet's tell them our chicken coop is on a nuclear-waste dump.
The rest of the kids are gonna be jealous of us this Easter.
Kari, where'd you go?
Kari, l--
It's alive!
Oh, it's cute. Come here, little baby.
Kari, stay away! I'll protect you.
As usual, Tai came up with a brave plan of action.
It worked about as well as his other plans.
It's taking a bubble bath.
That was the first time any of us really connected with a Digimon.
As time went on, we learned that not all Digimon turn out to be so friendly.
Kari, stop feeding it so many candy bars.
You'll make it sick.
Hey, those are mine! Thanks a lot.
Well, now that it's here, how do we get rid of it?
We can't keep it.
Where's it gonna sleep?
Oh, no, not in my bed!
Fine, then it sleeps on the couch.
I guess we'll just have to tell Mom it's a throw pillow.
I'll get it.
Hello? Tai speaking.
This is Sora. Mimi told me you were the one who threw up in my hat.
Something's wrong with her phone.
Perfect timing.
That's weird. All the electronic stuff in the house is going nuts.
Kari, look out!
It changed. It got bigger.
What did you do? Oh, no.
Where are we gonna hide him?
What's Mom gonna say if she finds out?
It can't get any worse.
It just got worse.
You'd better pin his ears back so they don't get in the food.
Boy, he looks pretty hungry.
He had a strange way of showing his appreciation.
Cut it out! Stop kissing my sister, you!
His breath stinks!
I've had enough. He's outta here.
We don't make much of a tag team, do we?
Kids, I made your favorite: liver sticks.
Great! In a minute.
-So, do you have a name?
-Koromon.
We're in luck. She burned them.
-Tai, his name is Koromon.
-Whose name?
Koromon, what are you anyway?
I'm a Digimon, short for Digital Monster.
I'm from the Digital World.
How come you talk to him, and only whistle at me?
My name is Kari. Kari.
And this is my brother.
His name is Tai. Tai.
-Hi, Kari-Kari, Tai-Tai.
-Never mind.
He can talk.
-You two are the best friends I ever had.
-We're the only friends you've had.
Thanks for saving me from that scratching fur-ball.
Just warn me before you kiss me again.
Once a Digimon truly becomes your friend, they'll do anything for you.
Anything.
Let's have a warning for this, too.
Every time that thing changed shape, or what we now call "digivolved"...
...there was a weird electrical surge throughout the city.
Of course, there was only one way to get Tai's attention.
I'm up. What?
Koromon? What's the matter with him?
Is he sick?
You gave him your liver sticks, didn't you?
You should know that this Koromon isn't the one we befriended later on.
Look! That's gotta hurt.
When this one digivolved, he expanded more than my Uncle Fred at Thanksgiving.
Nice dinosaur. Friendly dinosaur.
Kari, get down from there!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get grounded for this.
What's going on in there?
Did you kids break another lamp?
Piggyback?
Kari, no!
Now let's play horsey.
If Mom's worried about the lamp, wait till she sees her car!
Look both ways before you cross the street.
See any cars?
Do you even know what a car is?
Just be careful, then.
Soda. I'm thirsty. Are you?
Mom usually just puts money in, but I guess that works too.
Just one each.
Where are you going?
How hard could it be to find a dinosaur?
You know, we really shouldn't be playing in the street.
-Did you see that?
-No, I was sleeping.
But you're driving!
-Can we do that ride again?
-Pepper Flame.
Tai wasn't far behind us. He was following our footprints in the diet soda.
Why are you looking at that bus?
Please don't blow it up.
I know my mom says they're always late...
...but they can't help it.
Don't be a bad boy!
I wanna go home now, okay?
Oh, boy!
And that's when we saw our second DigiEgg.
But this one was a lot bigger, and the Digimon inside it, a lot meaner.
I'd hate to see the chicken that egg came out of.
That's a big bird.
Pepper Flame!
Mimi, it's Joe.
Quick, look outside your window.
Polly want a cracker? A really big cracker?
Koromon? Kari!
-Koromon, please don't fight!
-Kari, come on, we gotta go!
-Koromon!
-Kari, it's too dangerous!
Pepper Flame!
My turn.
Sonic Destroyer!
Izzy, did you see that?
What's wrong with the phone?
-You okay?
-Who's that?
Koromon?
I'm Greymon now.
You can be whoever you want, big guy.
Nova Flame!
Cool!
Greymon!
Don't quit!
Sonic Destroyer!
Oh, no, Tai! He's hurt.
-There's nothing you can do.
-Greymon, get up!
Greymon, wake up. He's coming!
It worked on me.
Come on, Tai.
-Go for it!
-Nova Flame!
Greymon!
That night changed our lives.
It was a while before we realized that those of us...
...who saw what happened became the DigiDestined.
Greymon...
...don't you wanna play horsey with me anymore?
Where are you?
It was even longer before we found out that Willis met...
...his Digimon that same night.
He learned alone that being a DigiDestined means...
...sometimes you gotta save the world...
...even if you're the one who caused the problem.
It was another DigiDestined, Izzy, who first noticed there was trouble.
Prodigious!
A computer virus on the lnternet.
Wait a minute.
It's attacking something.
Let me see if I can get an image of its target.
Izzy wasn't the only one tracking the virus.
The whole world was watching.
But no one was prepared for what was about to happen.
Looks like a DigiEgg.
Where'd that come from?
The virus is causing the egg to develop abnormally fast.
I think it's gonna hatch.
Across town, Tai and another DigiDestined,
Sora, were facing their own problem.
"Dear Sora:
I'm sorry about what happened.
"l haven't felt so bad since I accidentally...
"...threw up in your hat and didn't tell you before you wore it.
"l know our relationship has been stormy lately.
"You love thundershowers, what's a few raindrops between friends?
"Love, Tai."
"Love." I mean, "From." I mean....
Who are you writing to, Tai?
It's just an e-mail joke.
What are you doing in here anyway, Kari?
I wanted to show you my new dress.
I'm going to a birthday party.
I got my friend a pink Power Ranger.
Tai and I had a give-and-take relationship.
I would give and he would take.
-Who cares?
-To send...
...you have to click this. Click!
I wasn't gonna send that letter.
-Then what did you write it for?
-Go to your party.
I can't believe Sora's gonna read my letter.
Wait a minute, "Unable to deliver"?
I can't believe she's not gonna read my letter.
You try to tell a girl you're sorry and your computer shuts you down.
Surprise!
Mom? Can I make a complaint?
Kari's eating birthday cake right now, and all we have is leftover tofu.
I can make you a cake, Tai.
Hand me an egg, please.
No.
I needed to use up the rest of the wheat germ anyway.
You get the door and I'll start on that cake.
Izzy, you're all sweaty. What's wrong?
Well, it's about the egg.
The egg has already hatched.
Not that egg. A DigiEgg!
My Digimon analyzer doesn't even recognize it.
Looks like a cross between a jellyfish and a contact lens.
-It's part Digimon, part virus.
-A Digimon with a virus? So?
You kidding? If it stays on the lnternet it could destroy technology as we know it.
If it just hatched, how do you know this stuff?
This kid I met on the lnternet,
Willis, from Colorado, e-mailed me.
I don't know where he gets his information.
He's smart though.
He's in elementary school...
...but he's already taking classes at Colorado State.
So what? I'm in junior high school and I take classes at junior high school.
Look! The jellyfish digivolved.
He's sending an e-mail.
It says: "I'm hungry! "
Am I supposed to call for pizza?
He's eating computer data.
When he's done in this buffet line...
...he's gonna look for a database with more food.
More food? What does he expect to find?
A grocery store?
Okay, that's one box of chocolates.
Your total comes to 1,000,125--
Yeah, that's what it says.
That must be really good chocolate.
Paper or plastic?
In supermarkets all over, computer systems are failing...
...causing congestion at the registers.
And now for the weather.
I made beef-jerky shakes.
-No, thanks, Mom.
-Where are you going?
We need to use Dad's computer.
Don't you want your shake?
-I'm glad someone appreciates my recipes.
-Thanks, Mrs. Kamiya.
-We gotta be careful with my dad's stuff.
-Get out of my way.
A Digimon is eating the lnternet and you're worried about a few books!
But my dad likes his mess where it is.
We'll have more capabilities by networking our computers together.
Why don't we just call up the Digimon on the screen and hit "Delete"?
Don't you think I've tried that?
If this is dangerous, maybe we should call someone...
-...Iike the principal or Bill Gates.
-They won't listen.
Willis warned his lnternet carrier about the new Digimon.
They said, "Great! Let's sign him up and give him 50 free hours."
-All right, we're online.
-He's digivolved again.
My name is Keramon.
-I think he's at the Rookie level.
-This soon? He's digivolving too quickly!
-He's probably at a fast food web site.
-Now what?
Nothing.
We have to watch it eat...
...the world out of house and homepage?
I wish Agumon was here to help us.
I can almost hear him now.
You can hear me now.
It's like he was here.
I am here.
Agumon, where are you?
I can barely hear you.
-Take me off speakerphone.
-It's a transmission...
...from the Digital World.
-Agumon!
-And he's with Gennai.
-It's been a long time.
-Don't forget me.
Tentomon!
Who else is there?
-Biyomon.
-Pabumon.
-Palmon.
-Patamon.
-Gomamon.
-Gatomon.
We need to talk.
Something's threatening the Internet.
We know. The Digimon's already causing major problems in our world.
-I'm not sure it is a Digimon.
-But it is dangerous.
The evil Dark Masters were cupcakes compared to this guy.
That's it, then. Let's do it!
We found a way to enter the Internet.
We'll help you guys because you're the best friends we've ever had.
What better way to express friendship than to save your world.
Tentomon.
Don't get so emotional.
Thanks a lot, guys. You won't be alone.
We'll be right here on the computer.
-lzzy, Digivice?
-I'm one step ahead of you, Tai.
Our Digivices will help you digivolve and together we'll squash that bug.
It'll take a minute for Agumon and Tentomon to get on the Net.
My modem 's older than I am.
I'll call the other DigiDestineds so their Digimon can help, too.
Hi, this is Tai Kamiya.
Can I speak to Joe, please? A test?
He's the only kid I know who volunteers for summer school.
Hi, is Matt or T.K. there?
They're visiting their grandmother in the country?
Hey, Tai. Any luck yet?
Would you like a glass of potato juice, lzzy?
Great! I'd love some.
Be there, be there.... Hello there!
This is Tai.
You're selling ties?
No, my name is Tai.
I'm looking for Matt or T.K.
That's a coincidence.
Those are my grandkids' names.
That's great. Are they there?
Right now? Can I talk to them?
I love to talk to them, too.
They're here visiting me.
Please, I need to speak to them right away.
Okay, I'll tell them. Kids!
I can't take this!
You know, lzzy, I can never get Tai to try any of my recipes.
-I think they taste great.
-Want to try my spinach cookies?
I got Mimi's machine.
Hi, it's Mimi. I'm so glad you called.
Let's get together for lunch.
Leave a very short message after the beep.
Mimi, I--
That girl loves to talk.
You're a natural in the kitchen, just like me.
Mom, I need to get a hold of Kari, right away.
Did she take your cell phone with her?
Do I have enough of this stuff?
Beats me, it's the first time
I've used flour to bake a cake.
Of course she's got it, in case of emergency.
Emergency. What does she think this is?
Happy birthday!
-Make a wish.
-Blow them out.
-Call them back.
-I can't come home.
A magician's coming over later and I volunteered to be sawed in half.
Whatever. Just tell the half with feet to run home soon.
I can't get anybody on the phone.
I want you to call Sora for me.
But you and she are good friends.
It makes more sense for you to call.
Just do it!
Are more friends coming?
I'll make three-bean salad.
Nobody's coming over, Mom.
That's all right.
I only have two beans, anyway.
Sorry, Sora's not home.
I'll tell her to call Tai's house as soon as she gets back.
Hold on, she just walked in.
I'll put her right on.
-Sora, I think Tai wants to speak to you.
-I'm not home.
I already said you're here.
Make something up.
I don't care what you tell him.
But, Sora l--
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
Goodbye.
Sora said she's not home.
-Did you two have an argument?
-None of your business!
You must've been a jerk if she doesn't want to talk to you.
-I didn't do anything!
-I meant that in a good way.
I can't believe she's still mad.
It all started over a hair clip.
He'd better have written me.
Greetings. You have no new mail. Okay?
No, it's not okay. Stupid Tai!
Thank you for visiting meow.com.
Miko, get down from there.
Agumon and Tentomon should be on the lnternet by now.
Does this information superhighway have a rest stop? I've got to go potty.
You should've gone before we left.
Just hold it!
You're gonna need a password.
You can use mine to get on the Internet:
Prodigious.
-Prodigious.
-They're in!
So this is what the lnternet looks like.
They need new wallpaper.
I hope this doesn't take long, it's my bath night.
There he is, go get him!
He doesn't know we're here.
Let's sneak up on him quietly.
Super Shocker!
That's quietly?
Pepper Breath!
That should have worked, but it didn't.
Keramon's sending us an e-mail. It says:
"So, you like to play games?"
I got a bad feeling about this, Agumon.
You better digivolve. Both of you. Now!
Agumon, digivolve to....
Tentomon, digivolve to....
-Greymon.
-Kabuterimon.
Bug Buster!
Electro Shocker!
Nova Blast!
You guys make this stuff look easy.
Hold that thought!
Keramon, digivolve to....
Infermon.
-No way, he's digivolved again.
-We've never seen this before.
Now he's at the Champion level, like Greymon and Kabuterimon.
-Electro Shocker!
-Nova Blast!
-Yeah!
-All right!
He's stronger than a Champion.
Spider Shooter!
Kabuterimon!
-Greymon, no!
-I think I've got it figured out now.
He's bypassed the Champion level and digivolved into the Ultimate level.
He's too strong for our Digimon now.
Then they're just gonna have to digivolve again.
Not so fast.
Greymon, digivolve to....
MetalGreymon!
He's gotta digivolve faster.
Agumon, say something!
Don't take me out, coach.
Tentomon?
I'm fine. Just one question:
Who's Tentomon?
They'll be okay, Tai.
They just need to rest for a while.
I can't believe that two Digimon at the Champion level weren't enough.
We'll never be able to defeat this thing.
Check this out. We're getting e-mails from around the world.
Here's one from Willis in America.
It says, "lzzy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Find a way to slow him down."
-What's he mean, "his fault"?
-I don't know.
Infermon is e-mailing us, too.
Why is he saying "hello" over and over again?
Look at the address.
He's at the telephone company taking over the phone lines.
If we lose our phone connection, we're finished.
That's the only way we have access to the lnternet.
I've got to warn everyone.
All circuits are busy. Try again later.
Oh, great. It's busy. Mimi!
-All circuits are busy. Try again later.
-Come on! How could that be busy too?
-All circuits are still busy.
-Don't tell me!
-Didn't you hear me? It's busy!
-I'm sorry, lady.
All the phones are dead.
-That Digimon did it.
-Not a single call can get through.
Hello, this is Tai.
Hello. Did you program me?
It's lnfermon.
Hello?
Talk about speed dialing!
Infermon was looking for someone.
He was calling every number in the world.
His long-distance bill will be enormous.
What?
"Connection terminated."
What next?
Kids, cake's almost ready.
Phones have gone dead worldwide.
If your telephone is dead, call your phone company.
At least my sister can't call me three times a day.
-See you!
-Are you leaving so soon?
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Save me a piece of cake.
What's the matter with you?
Have you heard? The phones are out.
The stock market is in chaos and people are rioting.
That's nice.
Tai says call, then he won't get off the phone.
We interrupt this programming for a special bulletin.
Goody, I bet it's one of those high-speed chases.
The phone company has set up an emergency voice-mail system.
Simply dial 171 for easy instructions.
Believe me, it wasn't so easy.
First you had to leave a message, then call back to hear one.
Basically, it was playing phone tag.
Perfect! Voice mail!
To leave a message, press 1.
To retrieve a message, press 2.
Please leave your message at the tone.
Matt, T.K., this is an emergency.
Call me right away! By the way, it's Tai.
Kari, if you want to see your toys again, get home right away!
Sora, listen, I'm sorry about the hairpin.
But I need to talk to you right away.
Call me. Or just come over.
Stupid Tai.
Mimi, it's Tai. Please come to my house as soon as you get this message. 'Bye.
That reminds me.
You got this postcard in the mail from Mimi.
What?
She's on vacation? In Hawaii?
Hawaii is paradise.
I don't have a care in the world.
I'm wishing you were here.
-Hi, lzzy. Welcome back.
-Thank you.
So, when's everybody coming over?
Cheer up already.
What happened to the days when we were a team?
We are a team, Tai, but we're just kind of spread out right now.
By the way, where did you disappear to?
-Well, I went to pick this up.
-What is it?
A satellite uplink.
We can get onto the lnternet by tapping into the military's satellite system.
You're a genius. How does it work?
Do you know what a semiconductor is?
One who works part-time on a train?
Never mind!
-ls it hooked up yet?
-Almost.
In the meantime, check the messages to see if anyone called back.
I forgot.
You have one new message.
Tai, it's Matt. What's the big emergency?
Call me back.
I gotta go.
Grandma fell asleep on T.K. again.
Good old Matt.
I knew that somebody on the team would come through.
Matt, did you and T.K. bring your Digivices with you?
Did you pack them?
This is T.K., of course we have them.
What's going on?
An evil Digimon has taken over the Internet.
Agumon and Tentomon are fighting it, but they need help.
Get your Digivices to a computer as fast as you can.
What do we do now?
The closest thing our grandmother has to a computer is an egg timer.
We're going into town to find one.
The uplink's working. We're back online.
Now let's exterminate that bug.
He left the phone company.
Now where is he?
He sent another e-mail.
"I'm close to him"? Close to who?
-He's in America.
-He doesn't even have a green card.
-I said slow down!
-I can't hear you!
The Digimon's in New York.
He's eaten all the data at Kennedy Airport and is headed for the subway system.
Good, that'll slow him down for sure.
I'll e-mail Willis and let him know that lnfermon is heading his way.
I do have one question though:
What do you think that Digimon would be like if the virus never attacked him?
I have one too:
Why are you still drinking that junk?
Just 'cause you don't eat healthy, doesn't mean that I don't.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
-We've got the Digivices.
-Now what?
Awesome! We'll tell Gennai to upload
Gabumon and Patamon onto the Net.
You can do that?
That sounds like fun.
-Usually I just play Solitaire on that thing.
-Careful, Floyd, you almost cut my ear off.
Kids today are so smart, aren't they?
I still can't set the time on my VCR.
Matt, who are all those weird people?
They're not weird. They're my best friends.
Considering this is the only computer in town.
Gennai's transfer of the Digimon is almost completed.
Can I have yours?
You're the bravest kid I have ever known.
We're going back in.
I assume lzzy and Tai were unsuccessful in finding anyone else.
Then you and I'll have to try to beat that thing by ourselves.
-Sorry we're late.
-I was surfing the Net and I wiped out.
Gabumon and Patamon!
-ls T.K. on this ride?
-He's not tall enough.
Gabumon!
Patamon!
Say hello later. We've got work to do.
Keep your legs and wings inside the ride at all times.
Just a little further, guys. Remember, he's dangerous, so stay focused.
I'm looking for the programmer.
Don't interfere!
-He's teasing us.
-Then let's get him.
It's time to digivolve.
-Gabumon, warp digivolve to....
-Agumon, warp digivolve to....
WarGreymon.
MetalGarurumon.
-All right!
-Patamon, you better digivolve.
Patamon, digivolve to....
Infermon, digivolve to....
Diaboromon.
-What's going on?
-He digivolved.
Cable Crusher!
Look out, Patamon!
I'll save him.
-Patamon, are you all right?
-Tentomon!
I'm fine. What about Patamon?
Patamon, speak to me!
Come on, get up! Say something!
-I'm coming! I'll come get you!
-You can't.
But you can.
Wipe him out!
Ice Wolf Spikes!
Web Wrecker!
Tentomon, circle around!
WarGreymon, attack!
-It's no use.
-What are you saying? We're winning.
-This could be it.
-Great.
Not that!
-What's going on?
-There's something wrong with me.
-What is it?
-I think it's your mother's recipes.
I hate to tell you I told you so, but, I told you so!
Look, something's wrong.
Oh, no, they're slowing down.
Come on!
Tai, where'd you go?
WarGreymon has practically stopped moving.
Oh, no!
-I feel a lot better.
-I didn't touch anything, I swear!
-Tai, what did you do?
-lt wasn't my fault.
Who told you to go to the bathroom at such an important time?
Like I had a choice!
Why did you crash the computer?
Now it has to reboot.
-It's not like I did it on purpose.
-Just like it wasn't your fault with Sora.
That wasn't my fault.
Okay, maybe it was my fault.
What happened?
I gave her this great hairpin for her birthday.
Then she got mad and said,
"You don't like my hair style?"
I said "Who could tell?
You always wear a hat. "
Then she said, "Now you hate my hat?"
It's very confusing.
That's what you fought about?
I tried to apologize, but she won't return my phone calls.
We're back online.
WarGreymon!
Where were you?
You two picked a lousy time to take a lunch break!
What happened to him? WarGreymon!
Tai, I can't move!
I let him down. I should have been there.
-"Your Digimon's a loser."
-What did you say?
"How could two Mega-level Digimon get beat by one lousy bug?
"WarGreymon quit like a coward."
You take that back or I'll--
I was reading an e-mail from another kid.
You didn't have to read it so well.
You two, this isn't the time for fighting.
Stupid e-mails!
Go back to the beginning.
Diaboromon's back! Another e-mail?
"Who can count backwards from ten?"
Is he giving us a math test?
What's that?
What's with the timer?
He's making copies of himself.
He's multiplying.
It gets worse! The USA just launched two nuclear missiles.
Willis says the government can't explain it...
...but he knows Diaboromon's in the Pentagon's computers.
I hope I didn't lead him there with my satellite uplink.
One of the missiles is headed for Colorado.
-They'll land in less than ten minutes.
-That explains the timer.
But what's in Colorado?
I have no idea. In the meantime,
Diaboromon keeps multiplying.
The military has the power to stop it.
Every country is trying to intercept them, including Japan.
But Diaboromon has infiltrated all their computers...
...and is rerouting them to fall in the ocean near Hawaii.
Fireworks!
I've got the trajectory for the other missile.
Let me calculate it.
Four carry the two, times three....
It's aimed right for this neighborhood.
Look, e-mails from around the world:
"Get that evil Digimon.
You're our only hope."
Here's another: "Be home by 6:00."
Wait. That's from my mom.
I'm trying to save the world and you're reading fan mail.
-We just lost our connection.
-Great!
I'll get it back. If we defeat the original
Diaboromon, the rest will disappear.
What?
All we have to do is destroy each one, until we find the original.
Sounds great. How many are there so far?
Spit it out, lzzy. How many are there?
There are over 75,000 and counting!
What's that?
It didn't sound like my stomach.
-Tai! Have faith! I'll find the original.
-WarGreymon!
I'll help you.
MetalGarurumon.
They're so slow.
It's because of all the e-mails.
They're slowing down our Digimon processing speed.
I'll write to everyone to stop them e-mailing till the Digimon are strong again.
Are you crazy? Do you know how long that'll take? There's no time.
Now we're...
...just about...
-...finished.
-lt can't end like this.
Tell me, will they make it?
I'm not sure.
But they're gonna try.
Don't give up! No matter what happens, don't give up!
Don't interfere!
How many copies of Diaboromon are there now?
To be honest, I don't know.
I stopped keeping track a while ago.
It's got to be well over a million.
MetalGarurumon!
WarGreymon has started to slow down again.
It's the e-mails.
They're coming in faster than ever.
They're slowing down the processing speed even more.
They're sitting ducks out there.
Please, guys, stop writing!
I know your intentions are good, but you're hurting our cause.
Your e-mails are putting our Digimon in danger.
I've got to help.
There must be a way....
Somehow.
More juice, lzzy?
I just squeezed some onions.
No, thanks, I'm rerouting incoming data from the remote server into local memory.
I'll just leave you two alone.
Wait a minute, where did Tai go?
None of us are sure how, but Tai's bond with WarGreymon was so strong...
... Tai, himself, became digital.
WarGreymon, I'm here.
MetalGarurumon!
Wake up! Don't quit now!
-Why won't he answer me, Tai?
-Keep trying, Matt.
Listen, I don't have a whistle to wake you.
But I want you to know you're not alone.
The mail keeps coming. It won't stop.
Kids from all over the world are writing to you.
They need your help.
You're the only one who can do it.
Feel their hope. Feel their strength.
I feel them.
Where'd your brother go?
They combined.
Part WarGreymon.
Part MetalGarurumon.
They digivolved together to become....
Omnimon.
Transcendent Sword!
Hurry!
Supreme Cannon!
Tai, there's the original. Get him!
We're running out of time!
Omnimon! Quick, attack!
Where is he?
One minute to go.
One minute to go.
One minute to go.
Squad leader to Command, we were unable to destroy the target.
The missile will impact.
Repeat: The missile will impact.
He keeps moving.
Every time he's in our sights, he jumps somewhere else.
He's too fast for us.
We have the power to destroy him now, but we don't have the time.
Willis was right, we have to find some way to slow down Diaboromon.
Thirty seconds left.
The e-mails!
If I forward him all the e-mails, it'll slow him down, just like it did to us.
Keep sending them, kids.
You've got mail.
Ten seconds left.
Nine...
...eight...
...seven...
...six...
...five...
...four...
...three...
...two...
...one.
Connection terminated.
Willis!
Lousy microwave!
How come every electronic appliance has to have a bug in it?
Greetings.
You have one new piece of mail.
It's about time.
"Dear Sora: I'm sorry.... Threw up hat....
"What's a few raindrops between friends?
Love, Tai."
Stupid Tai!
I'm about to barf.
Wait till you try the cake.
When Willis saw what happened on the Internet...
...he was as happy as the rest of us.
So were the twins,
Terriermon and Kokomon.
They figured that would be the end of it.
But they were wrong.
It was just the beginning.
Kokomon!
Willis was about to face the Digibattle of his life.
But he was all alone.
These days the team is older, but some things never change.
Tai's still obsessed with soccer, and Sora 's still waiting for him to call.
Izzy's idea of a fun night is upgrading his computer...
...and Matt's trying to make it as a rock star.
His stage name is: "The DigiDestined formerly known as Matt. "
Even though the older kids don't have much time for the DigiWorld...
...there are new DigiDestined kids to pick up the slack.
That's Cody, a real sensitive little kid, and that's his Digimon: Upamon.
Yolei and Poromon can match wits with the best of them...
...as well as tan lines.
And there's Davis and DemiVeemon.
I know, Davis looks like my brother Tai.
They even have the same personality: obnoxious.
While they were having a good time at the beach...
...I was in New York with T.K...
...partly to visit Mimi and partly to make Davis jealous.
Smile!
Not again.
-lt didn't go through?
-No.
What's wrong with it?
I don't know. It says all lines are busy.
There must be an electrical surge.
What do you think we should do now, T.K.?
How about lunch?
Did you guys hear that?
Did we hear what?
I'm getting a feeling there's something strange out there...
...but I'm not sure what it is.
It needs our help though.
I hate it when I'm right.
It turned out that the person who needed our help was Willis.
Kokomon, this has to stop!
Go back!
What do you mean "back"? Back to what?
Destroy!
No!
Terriermon!
Bunny Blast!
Koko Krusher!
Bunny Blast!
Terriermon!
Hurry, T.K. It's over this way.
Kokomon, stop!
A Digimon!
I'm not sure it is a Digimon.
All right, tell me, what do you want?
Go back.
He vanished.
Hey, kid.
Come here.
Don't follow me! You're in danger!
Leave it to me.
I'll find out where he's going.
-What does he mean, "we're in danger"?
-All I know is he needs help.
Hi, Mom. Our summer camp is going backpacking in Colorado.
-We're leaving--
-Please deposit $2 for....
I'll call you when I get there.
Come on, Terriermon.
We have to find transportation.
I can't keep running from him.
We're going back.
Colorado? Why there?
I'm sending an e-mail to Davis and the others.
I told him to meet up with us.
We could really use their help, and I'm sure he misses me.
The D-Terminal!
"Found new kid with Digimon"?
Yeah, a new friend.
She wants us to meet them in Colorado.
Well, how does she expect us to get to America?
We don't have the money.
Willis, do we have to go to Colorado?
You heard what Kokomon said.
"Go back." That's where it all started.
But why do we have to walk?
My soles are worn out and I don't even wear shoes.
Terriermon, listen. We--
Come on, Willis, can't we just call for someone to give us a ride?
I'm sorry. You know
Kokomon's getting more violent.
He makes anyone close to us disappear.
I'll find us a ride.
-Let's get out of this sun. It's too hot.
-Wait!
What exactly do you think you're doing?
This way I don't have to walk, and you can stay in the shade.
That's better.
I don't suppose you could turn into a glass of lemonade, could you?
Look, my Digivice.
What's happening to the train?
I don't think this is the entertainment portion of the trip.
It's that Digimon we saw in New York.
Don't interfere!
There's definitely something different about this Digimon.
We're not moving. Where are we?
Don't interfere?
I don't think that Digimon wants us in Colorado.
Explain one more time why we have to stop in three different cities?
We're using my uncle's flyer miles and restrictions apply.
Why did we have to take this particular taxi company?
I've an uncle who lives in Houston.
He has an account with them.
-It's not really that bad.
-At least it's free.
What do you say, guys, wanna hear some music?
Sure, why not?
We prefer something on the slow and easy side.
Sure.
I'm pretty good.
'Bye, Uncle Fred.
Thanks for the lift. Goodbye.
Yolei, your uncle's a lousy pilot.
On the map, we're abut 60 miles from where we're meeting Kari.
-How do we get there?
-I have an uncle who owns some horses.
No! No more uncles, no more horses, no trains, no planes.
It's got to stop!
Did someone say stop?
Come on, guys, this is our chance.
Well, at least my way we weren't stowaways.
-Climb in. It's perfect.
-Let me handle this.
Yeah, ma'am, I said stop. I'm starting my own truck stop and was testing it.
It seems to work fine.
You stopped. Thanks.
-Let's go.
-Come on.
Hey, pal, you must've had the same idea we did.
Hey, would you cut that out? That's rude.
Sorry about that. He's young.
Davis, guess what? He's a Digimon.
A what?
Hey, he's right.
Wow! In America, they have Digimon by the truck load.
Our Digimon like each other.
And the guy says,
"l was talking to the duck."
This is kind of nice, being around others for a change.
Yeah, for as long as I can remember, it's just been me and Willis.
Having a Digimon makes you a DigiDestined...
...and we're all part of a team.
Why are you alone?
Well, let's just say I have my reasons.
Anyway, it's nice meeting someone as cute as you.
Back off there, blondie.
What's wrong, Davis?
Did I say something wrong?
We found this kid. Now what do we do?
He's angry because he wanted to be with Kari by now.
My family's vacation home is just a couple of towns away from here.
You guys can wait for them there if you want to.
I'd better e-mail Kari and T.K. to tell them where to meet us.
-Where are they coming from?
-From New York.
The kids behind the fence.
That girl was cute, too.
That's it, lover-boy. Leave Kari out of this.
I'm sorry.
Listen, Davis,
I wasn't trying to step on anybody's toes.
Maybe I should just make a phone call and get us a lift to my house.
I'd like a pizza for delivery with mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni...
...pineapple, Canadian bacon, anchovies, and green peppers.
That sounds delicious, but aren't you going to have anything?
If Davis eats it all....
-There's no fat below my neck.
-Since you're delivering that pizza...
...to my house, would you mind picking us up on the way?
-Tell him to forget it. I want Chinese.
-Shut up!
I said, "Line up."
We'll line up on the side of the road with a sign, so we're easy to spot.
-You've done this before.
-They'll be here in two minutes or it's free.
-Willis, you're smart.
-Well, it was mostly my idea.
Great, then you're buying the pizza!
-Pizza!
-Guys, come on, let's go!
-Why do I have to be the one paying for it?
-It's your pie. You buy.
Don't open your big mouth unless it's to eat pizza.
If I'm paying for it, I get the first half.
And I get the second half, too.
Now that that's settled,
I guess we're ready to go.
We'll tell you how the pizza tasted.
If that driver thinks he's getting a tip, forget it!
What is it?
Davis!
Destroy!
Kokomon.
You know this Digimon?
DemiVeemon, quick, digivolve!
DemiVeemon, digivolve to....
Veemon!
Vee Head Butt!
How about a little teamwork?
Pick me up. We'll attack him from the air.
All right, we've got you!
Watch out for that sign.
Time for plan B.
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!
Flamedramon, attack!
Fire Rocket!
One small detail.
Who is that? And why is he attacking us?
Cable Crusher!
Koko Krusher!
Kokomon, I'm doing what you want.
I'm going back.
Go back...
...to the beginning!
Willis, use your Digivice.
I feel strange.
Terriermon, digivolve to....
Gargomon!
He's got pants now.
Bunny Bubble!
Gargo Pellets!
Go back.
-What for?
-Go back.
He put up a good fight, but we won.
We didn't win anything.
He won't stop until I give him what he wants.
What does he want? Maybe I can help.
Don't ask questions.
It's for your own good.
-The less you know the better.
-Willis, wait.
We're a team now.
It's okay to tell them the truth.
Well, the truth is, we don't have a ride anymore.
No problem. I can handle that.
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Raidramon! The Storm of Friendship!
-Did somebody call for a ride?
-That's cool.
Couldn't you have done that before?
Can we get a ride, too?
Sorry, we're on a mission.
-It's a big gust of wind.
-No, it's Davis.
Same difference.
How do you stop this thing?
So, this Kokomon attacked you?
I knew we shouldn't have split up.
Where are your friends T.K. and Kari?
They're still not here yet.
What? What do you mean,
Kari's not here yet?
Good question.
They really should have been here by now.
If I know Kokomon, your friends aren't coming at all.
That's it, pal.
Enough secrets.
You seem to know a lot about this monster.
Spill it. How do you two know each other?
And more importantly:
Why is he only attacking you?
Because I created him.
You must be kidding.
You just can't create a Digimon out of thin air.
I've told you too much already.
Kokomon makes everyone who tries to help me disappear...
...Iike I'll bet he did to your friends T.K. and Kari.
Willis.
I have to do this by myself.
I need to be alone.
Great, I'll go with you.
Willis, we've been walking for hours and you haven't said a word.
Being a DigiDestined means you don't have to face things alone.
What are you running away from?
Eight years ago, a DigiEgg came out of my computer...
...and it hatched into twin Digimon:
Terriermon and Kokomon.
I finally had someone to play with.
My very own pets, and they talked, too!
It was the best.
They depended on me.
You have to give it time to heal, okay?
Sometimes they would even do my chores for me.
I wanted more of them...
...so I got the stupid idea of creating a DigiEgg on the computer.
That's when it all went bad.
Before my DigiEgg hatched, it was attacked by a virus...
...and it mutated into Diaboromon.
When Tai and the others destroyed him,
I thought my bad dream was over.
But the real nightmare was just beginning.
The virus tracked us down and dragged Kokomon away from me.
I watched helplessly for four years as he slowly became this terrible monster.
And now he's obsessed with chasing me.
During the battle he said to you,
"Go back to the beginning."
What did he mean?
I think he wanted me to come here where it all started.
Every time he tries to tell me why, the virus stops him.
He can't fight it.
This won't end until he's destroyed.
But I can't do it. It's all my fault, not his.
What's the matter with you?
That's the saddest story I ever heard.
I'm the one with the problem, not you.
-Get over it.
-Okay.
That was fast.
You know what? We're gonna help you.
You will? How are you gonna do that?
My friend, we're DigiDestined.
We'll find the answer together, as a team.
I've never been on a team.
Anything I should know?
Yeah, I'm the only one who can kiss Kari.
-Just a little one?
-Don't even joke around about this, got it?
-She and I really hit it off in New York.
-I'm not kidding.
Willis?
I don't mean to eavesdrop, but I've got really big ears.
I know you're facing Kokomon tomorrow.
I want to be right there next to you.
I couldn't live with myself if something were to happen to you.
This is my mistake and I won't risk your safety to correct it.
-He's my brother.
-I don't care!
Willis, I'm not your pet. I'm your friend.
And friends are always there for each other.
Now that's what I'm talking about: teamwork.
Thanks, pal.
Okay, let's find Kokomon.
Don't worry. He'll find us.
Go back!
I did! I'm here! What else do you want?
Destroy!
He has a lot of issues.
He's digivolving.
Terriermon, be careful. He's stronger now.
Terriermon, digivolve to....
Gargomon!
Veemon, your turn.
Show him what you're made of!
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!
Armadillomon, you too!
Armadillomon, armor digivolve to....
Digmon, the Drill of Power!
Hawkmon, go for it!
Hawkmon, armor digivolve to....
Halsemon, the Wings of Love!
Fire Rocket!
That's the way!
I'll trip him up. Almost tripped myself.
Gargo Pellets!
Don't make me do this.
How do you like your Kokomon, flame-broiled or grilled?
Can't we end this quickly?
After all, I'm on vacation.
Howdy.
Aren't our Digimon fantastic?
Digmon could be a little more animated.
I guess that's it.
I don't think he's gone.
Now what?
I'm not a duck.
I need a nap.
I think I strained something trying to digivolve.
We're being sucked in.
This is my fault.
Why? Are you the one who taught him to juggle?
Put us down, you clown!
-Leave them alone! Take me instead.
-Okay.
Watch out!
What do we have to do to end this fighting?
Destroy!
Bunny Blast!
A little help here.
Veemon!
Let me help you up.
Now let me help you up.
-Hawkmon, I'll help you.
-No need. I'm--
Oh, Hawkmon, I'm so glad you're not hurt.
Yes, I know, but you don't have to choke me to prove it.
Armadillomon!
Cody, I've been digging all over for you.
Vee Head Butt!
Bunny Blast!
Bombs away!
-We got him!
-Think again.
He's gonna eat us.
Hand of Fate!
Angemon!
And Angewomon!
You saved us! Exquisite timing.
Sorry we're late.
-Hey, look, T.K.
-Kari!
We would've been here sooner, but our plans got derailed.
Yeah! Kari, you made it!
Gatomon and Patamon were worried.
So they digivolved into Angewomon and Angemon.
Celestial Arrow!
Angel Staff!
Either this is an eclipse, or we're in trouble.
-I'm not supposed to be out after dark.
-It's cold.
Look, his wounds are healing.
It's got to be that virus inside of him.
Poromon, there's nothing you can do.
Stay here.
Let me go!
Davis, what's happening to you?
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size, you big bully?
Kokomon is making time go backwards.
Everyone's getting younger.
Davis, you're a baby.
Who are you calling a baby, you baby?
I'm a baby, look!
"Back to the beginning"?
Willis, "Back to the beginning" didn't mean go back to Colorado.
It means, go back in time to when the virus first attacked Kokomon.
-That's it.
-We have to stop him.
Before you know it, we'll be changing diapers.
Let me go!
I'm sorry but you're grounded.
We don't have the strength to defeat him.
The new Digimon will have to use the power of the golden DigiEggs.
We must digivolve to our Mega forms to release the golden DigiEggs.
Angemon, warp digivolve to....
Seraphymon!
Angewomon, digivolve to....
Magnadramon!
Aren't they beautiful?
Hurry, here he comes.
We released the golden DigiEggs.
Now the others can golden armor digivolve.
This is our last shot.
-What do I do with this?
-Just do exactly what I do.
You ready?
Golden armor energize!
Golden armor energize!
Veemon, golden armor digivolve to....
Terriermon, golden armor digivolve to....
Magnamon!
Rapidmon!
Is that the coolest thing you've ever seen, or what?
Rapid Fire!
Magna Blast!
-lt didn't work.
-He's too strong.
Every time we attack, he regenerates.
Let's blast him from the inside.
Good idea. Follow me!
He ate them. Terriermon!
Listen to me, Poromon.
You have to give it time to heal, okay?
Time to heal.
What's that up ahead?
I don't know. Look!
What's he doing?
He's trying to tell us something.
-What's he pointing to?
-There must be something inside of him.
The virus!
He's trying to show us how to help him.
What does he want us to do?
Destroy!
Destroy the virus!
Right. Time to heal.
Rapid Fire!
Magna Blast!
Kokomon!
Willis!
The virus, it's all gone.
Thank you.
Now I've lost both of them.
You'll never lose me, Willis.
I told you, I'm your friend.
Friends are always there for each other.
Terriermon!
I guess without the virus,
Kokomon couldn't heal himself anymore.
The battle was too much for him.
Don't be sad, Willis.
One thing you have to learn about Digimon, they never really die.
Thanks for coming back to New York with me. I'm gonna miss you guys.
-I think we'll see each other again.
-I sure hope so.
We're getting used to being part of a team.
Right, Terriermon?
Yeah.
One last thing. 'Bye.
Hey, what did I tell you about kissing Kari?
She's my girl.
What do you mean "your" girl?
Nothing, just guy talk.
Hi, Mom, I'm on the island.
I'm waiting for the ferry and I'll be home.
Yeah, I had a lot of fun. It was a great trip.
I met a lot of new friends.
I had a couple of fights, but I'll tell you later.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
Does anyone besides me smell a DigiEgg?
Kokomon!
Like I said, Willis learned about teamwork the hard way.
He also found out that Davis was right.
Digimon never really die.
Their information just gets reconfigured.
Only sometimes they come back singing a different tune.
He's tone-deaf.
Now, this might be
The room of any small boy... but it happens to belong to a boy named Christopher Robin.
And, like most small boys...
Christopher Robin had toy animals to play with.
And together they had many remarkable adventures... in an enchanted place... called the Hundred Acre Wood.
But of all his animal friends...
Christopher Robin's very best friend... was a bear called Winnie the Pooh.
Winnie the Pooh?
Wait halfa darn minute!
It seems to me that most of these stories are about that silly old bear.
Well, then, Tigger, who should this story be about?
Well, I happen to know someone... who's extremely fascinatin', not to mention handsome and debonair-y.
But the title already says
Winnie the Pooh.
Oh, that's easy to fix.
There! Now, that's a wonderful title.
And speaking of wonderful things--
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are wonderful things
Their tops are made out of rubber their bottoms are made out of springs
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one
Tiggers are cuddly fell as
Tiggers are awfully sweet
Everyone el-es is jealous
That's why I repeat and repeat
The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are marvellous chaps
They're loaded with vim and with vigour they love to leap in your laps
They're jumpy, bumpy, clumpy, pumpy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one
I'm the only--
Hello! I'm Tigger.
That's T-l-double-geh-er.
- And that's me. Hoo, hoo, hoo!
- I know.
You've bounced me lots and lots of times.
Yeah. Fun, ain't it?
Say, you want to go bouncin' with me, on account of bouncin's what tiggers do the-- eh, best.
- Eww.
- Well...
I would go bouncing with you, Tigger... except that I must count all these honey pots... to be sure that I have enough for winter.
Let me get that, please.
- Bother.
- Yech!
What do these Pooh bears like about this icky, sticky stuff anyway?
Well, no time for goofi n' off.
I've got dawdlin' to do.
Hoo, hoo! T.T.F.N.!
Ta-ta for now! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Oh, d-d-dear, dear.
Hiya, Piglet, old pal!
What say you and I do a little bouncin' together?
B-B-Bouncing? Oh, my!
I-l haven't enough firewood to last the winter, and--
Why, sure, you do!
Why, there's lots of firewood.
What's this?
It's lyin' all over the place.
- Whoa! Whoa!
- There. See?
- Now we can go bouncin'.
- B-But...
I would really rather prefer that my firewood... not have quite so much chair in it.
Oh. Well, then, uh, T.T.F.N.!
Gotta be bouncin' along!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Well, hello there!
And good mornin', Mrs Kanga, ma'am!
Well, good morning,
Tigger, dear.
She called me "dear."
Pardon me for askin', but you wouldn't happen to be interested... in doin' a bit of bouncin' with me, would ya?
Well, I'm afraid I have just too much to do this morning, dear.
Oh. Well, if you have to--
See ya later. Bye.
Tigger! Tigger!
Tigger.
Oh.
I wonder why nobody wants to bounce with me.
Oh, well.
What am I talkin' about?
There's plenty of others I haven't even asked yet. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
And so, the others all came 'round... to see what they might do to help.
But the end of Eeyore's house was merely the beginning... of a very unfortunate day.
Wow! Look at the size of it.
Your attention, uh, please.
I have officially completed the plans.
- What plans?
- The plans for removing this boulder... and restoring to Eeyore, uh, his happy home.
No need to bother on my account.
All we need is a little, uh, uh, team effort.
Rabbit's Rock Remover!
Now, then, Pooh bear, release the counterweight.
Kanga and Roo... start depressurizing the granite extractor.
Piglet? Piglet... start pulling your own weight over there.
But l-- I don't weigh anything.
A-- A little more over there.
Yes. That's good.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Over here. This way. This way.
All right, now--
- Oh, good. I think--
- Bother.
- Oh, my.
- Oh!
Well, now, why didn't it work?
Oh, let's see here now.
- The counterweight--
- Perhaps we could use another helping hand.
Yes. All we really need is--
- Tigger!
- Hello, you blokes!
- Anyone up for a little bouncin'?
- No! No!
No bouncing! Look!
Just look at all this work we have to do!
What? Movin' that old thing?
Hoo, hoo!
Not a problem.
All you need is a little bouncin'.
How will b-bouncing move the rock, T-Tigger?
Tut, tut, tut.
Not now, Piglet.
If maybe we had a little, uh--
Mm-hmm. Right there!
"Bouncing will move this boulder."
It's almost amusing.
Whoo!
Oh! Help!
Whoa!
Wow!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Now that that's outta the way... who's up for a little bouncin'?
What is it with you and bouncing?
Just look at my rock remover.
Everything's ruined... and all you can think about is bouncing!
But that's what tiggers do best.
Exactly. Unlike us.
I'm afraid he's right, dear.
Wh-What we're trying to say is that, uh... we really can't bounce like tiggers... anyway because, uh--
We're not tiggers.
Who needs them other fell as anyhow?
Mostly I'm happy and I'm bouncy
Because lam the on liest one
But now all at once
I feel so lonely
For someone like me
Someone like me
Right now
I'm sort offeerin 'downcy
I'm just about the loneliest one
And deep in my heart
I'm sort of wishin'
For someone like me
Someone like me
Somebody with springs and things
Who laughs and sings
And jumps everyday
Somebody who's fun, fun, fun
Who loves to trounce and pounce
And bounce their gloomies away
Howl dream there is another
A double or a triple of me
To keep him company
But since I'm awake
I feel so lonely
Because I know it can't be
It never can be
Bein' that I'm the one and on liest
Someone
Like me
Someone like me
Tigger? Um--
T-Tigger?
Don't be sad, Tigger.
Wh-Why don't you go bouncin'?
That'll cheer you up.
No one to bounce with, Roo boy.
Oh. Well... what about another tigger?
Another tigger?
Well, that--
No, it's-- it's impossibibble.
It's crazy.
I'm the on liest one.
But aren't there other tiggers?
I've got a mama. Don't you have a family somewhere too?
Why, that's ridic-- Uh--
I mean--
Ooh, a family full of tiggers, you say.
Hoo, hoo.
Can you imaginate such a thing?
Why, that'd be more tiggers than you could stick a shake at.
And we'd all be bouncin'!
Bouncin' morning, noon and nighty-night!
- Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
- But I could still bounce with ya, right, Tigger?
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
My very own tigger family!
Oh-ho. You wish to find your family.
A most noble quest, indeed.
There we are.
Help yourself to the cream and sugar.
The search for
Familius Genus Tiggeris.
That is Latin, I believe.
Or is it, uh, Greek?
Speaking of family, why, my very own family portraits... hang right over there... a collection I've gathered throughout the years.
Notice the interesting twists and turns of its many branches... stretching out across the ages.
It all comes from having strong roots, you know... and plenty of time to grow.
In fact, I do believe that the very seed of my family... began to germinate as far back as the 1 4th century... when a great-great-great grand-uncle of mine... went out on a limb and proclaimed his blossoming love... for a blooming young maid.
As their love blossomed, they eventually... were blessed with nine fine young saplings.
Never a bough did break--
Now, my dear boy, are you quite all right? Perhaps some more tea.
Anyway, if I may go out on a limb here...
I would first and foremost suggest for Tigger... that to find one's family, one must first look up... one's family tree.
Oh, it does bring to mind a distant nephew of mine.
An odd sort of fellow. He became a sailor and fell in with a member...
- of the feline persuasion.
- My... family tree?
My family tree!
Why didn't I think of thinkin' of that?
So long, beak lips! Thanks for the tip!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo, hoo!
I say.
Was it something I said?
And so began
Tigger's grand search... for his family tree.
He searched high.
He searched low.
He searched near... and he searched far.
Yoo-hoo!
Family! Family!
Hello!
But Tigger, how are you gonna know... which tree is your family tree?
Why, that's obvious, Roo boy.
My tigger family tree has got to be the biggest... hugest and most gigantical tree in the entire Hundred Acre Woodses... on account of all the enormous numerical numerous numbers of... tigger family members that'll be on it.
And besides and furthermore, it'll be all stripedy... just like yours truly.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
The only question is... where could my family tree be?
There! Good as new.
Or maybe even better, if I do say so myself.
Could be a bit drafty.
Might leak some.
Sort of lopsided.
Kind of cramped.
Otherwise, a dream house.
Hiya, donkey boy!
Hiya, donkey boy!
- Tigger.
- Tigger!
- Tigger?
Back to his bouncy old self.
Oh, is this perhaps a tigger family tree up there?
Were you asking us to bounce with you? Because, you see, we would be glad to--
Hello, tigger family!
Hello!
- Uh, no, not this one. Hello!
- Hello!
- Other tiggers, come out, come out, wherever you are!
- Other tiggers!
- Come out, come out, wherever you are!
- And aren't! Et cetera!
- Hello! Tigger's family!
- Hello! Tigger's family!
- Where are you?
- Pooh bear?
I didn't know Tigger had a family.
Yes. Only it appears... that he has lost them.
Seemed to be lookin' for 'em.
Uh, was that something we were supposed to be doing too?
Why, I believe it must be, Piglet.
I quite often remember to forget these sorts of things.
Oh, no, no.
Aren't you coming, Rabbit?
Huh? To look for more tiggers?
As if one wasn't bad enough.
No, no! No!
I have too many winter preparations to make.
And-- And if you three had any sense, you'd be doing the same.
Come on.
- Hello! Hello!
- Hello!
- Tiggers! Come out, come out, wherever you aren't!
- Tiggers!
- Hello! Tiggers!
-Just where aren't those tiggers anyway?
We looked every which and where... not to mention right over there... and not a single stripedy tree in sight.
Maybe I've been going about this all the wrong way upside down.
Maybe what I need to do is find some sort of clue... as to where are their whereabouts.
What kind of clue?
Maybe in here. Some thingamabob or an heir-i-loom or something.
Oh! Maybe this belonged to my uncle!
Whatever.
And just think... if there are other tiggers, we could all bounce... the Whoop-de-Dooper, Loop-de-Looper,
Ali-Ooper Bounce!
'Cause it's the bounce that tiggers do best.
The Whoop-de-w--
What kind of bounce?
Oh, you know, that bounce I bounc-ed when I bounced that big rock... the most hardest bounce of them all that only the very bestest bouncers can bounce.
- You know.
- Only the very bestest bouncers... can bounce it.
Oh! Could my auntie have made this for me?
I could bounce it.
It looks like she made a pair.
If you could teach me the Whoopy
Super-Duper Bounce, then I could--
Teach ya the W-D-double-L-A-O-B?
What? That's ridickerous!
Why, it-- it's a--
It's a very powerful bounce, and it's only... for professional bouncers.
But I'm a real good bouncer.
Hoo, hoo, hoo.
No offence there, Roo boy... but I think you're a little on the smallish side of tiny... and kinda lackin' in perpendicaler.
I-l could do the Whooper Dooper, uh--
The Looper Dooper, uh--
If you teach me.
Oh, you can't bounce the bounce... if you can't even pronounce the bounce.
Repeat after Tigger.
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
It's got the zip that makes you flip and that's what really counts
In the Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
Now, half this bounce is 90 percent mental.
If you calculate the specific tiggerjectory... of your stripecelleration dicipherus... by the square boot of your rebounce, your vertical situituation indicator... and your stripersonic springnertia should ric-a-ticochet... your hydranific fu-silly-age... into an accelerometric de-orbit!
- Any questions?
- When do I get to learn the Whooping Looper Whooper--
I mean, the Looper
Dooper Whooper, uh--
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
The more you try, the more you fly and that's what really counts
In the Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
Now, you swing your legs up high, and you twist your tail in tight.
Wind up all your springs... and with your eyes situated straight ahead... you let it all loose.
Um, is this right?
It's best when done by tiggers
'cause ourtiggerific figgers
Are filled with vim sand vigours and that's the thing that triggers
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
- The more you try, the more you fly and that's what really counts
- Right.
It activates, it elevates accelerates and more
- Whee!
- You're bouncing off the ceiling like you never did before
- The Whoop-de-Dooper
- Whoop-de-Dooper
- Loop-de-Looper
- Loop-de-Looper
Ali-Ooper
Bounce
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Wow! Now me! Now me!
Tut, tut, tut!
Hoo, hoo, hoo. Wait a minute.
We haven't gone over all the safety rules and regularations.
- Aw!
- Rule number one:
Always bounce in a well-lit area.
Rule number the-next-one:
Never bounce near an open flame.
Rule three: Never bounce right after eatin', or you'll get tail cramps.
- First you-- And then you--
- Rule number four:
Do not forget rule number--
And then you let it all loose with a--
Rule number--
Whoo!
Whoa!
I think you let it a little too loose.
Maybe another lesson?
I could--
What is this doohickey?
Why, that's no doohickey.
It's a thingamabob.
Been in the family for generations.
And I never even knew
I had a doo-- Hoo, hoo, hoo!
This is the exact thingamabob
I was lookin' for.
And it must have a picture... of my tigger family inside it.
- Oh, boy!
- Oh! I can't wait.
I'll bet I got my mother's eyes... and my father's tail and-and-- one of my sister's chins, of course.
My grand pappy's stripes.
It's kind of, sort of--
Empty.
Completely tiggerless.
How am I supposed to find my family now?
M-Maybe there's another way to reach 'em.
Another way?
A letter!
Why don't you write 'em a letter?
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
- Hello!
- Hello?
- Hello out there.
Hello! Tigger's family?
Tigger's family tree.
Hello!
Uh, how will we know a tigger family member... when we see one?
I suspect that he, or she... would be rather more bouncy than usual, Piglet.
I found 'em--
Tigger's family.
- Really?
- Oh! Where, Eeyore?
Here they are, bouncin' like anything, stripes and all.
No need to thank me.
Do these particular tiggers seem... rather strange to you, Piglet?
Y-Y-Yes, and rather f-fierce.
Still, I suppose you never can tell with tiggers.
Pardon me, Mr-- or Mrs-- Tigger... but could you perhaps accompany me back to Tigger's house?
He misses you very much, you see.
And he--
Oh, bother.
Uh-- Uh, hello, tigger family member.
Uh, uh, I was wondering--
That is, i-i-ifyou're not too busy--
Oh! Whoa!
D-D-Dear.
Sinkin'? Figures.
If I could just have a moment?
But-But please come back!
We really need your help.
It would just take a minute. Oh, bother.
Nice tigger.
Ooh, hoo!
I-l don't remember tiggers being quite this s-slippery, do you, Pooh?
Well, now that
I think of it...
I don't remember a tigger making quite that sort of sound either.
- Piglet.
- Yes, Pooh bear?
I don't think these are the right sort of tiggers after all.
Not that anyone will miss me.
Let me see now.
"Dear T-l-double-geh-ers. Tiggers.
Greetin's and salivatin's!
Please drop by any old time... on account of my house... is your house, and vice-y verse-y.
Love, Tigger."
Hoo, hoo.
There! That oughta do it!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Now there's nothin' to do... but wait.
- Hello, Tigger's family.
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Tigger's family?
- Are you out there?
- Anybody out there?
Why, if my tummy is not mistaken... this particular family tree... is a bee sort of family tree.
And where there are bees... there's honey.
Um, I think there may be something moving... in this tree.
D-Do you think it could be...
Tigger's family up there,
Pooh bear?
I suppose there's only one way to find out, Piglet.
Just as my tummy suspected.
Ow!
Bother. If only these bees were a bit less... busy.
Perhaps if I hummed a soothing sort of song...
Like such:
Go to sleep
Shh, quiet lf you're a bee
A lullaby
Lullabee, lullabee
Honey bees in the tree
Rest your wings
Till the morning light
Lullabee, lullabee
Honey bees in the tree
Your honey
Is safe tonight
Just dream to the tune
I 'am singing
Time to stop
All that buzzing and
Stinging
Mm, ouch.
Lullabee, lullabee
Honey bees in the tree
All I want is a smackrel
Or two
Or three
Don't sleep lightly
Sleep very tightly
Happy slumbers
To you
Shh.
Pooh bear's been up in that tree an awful long time, don't you think?
Most likely he's stuck.
Been known to happen.
Oh, d-dear!
Then l-- I'd better climb up and-and see if he's all right.
Uh, Pooh bear.
- Uh, a-a-are you stuck?
- Oh!
Oh, bother.
Uh, Pooh bear?
- Oh! Piglet.
- Yes, Pooh?
- I have come to the conclusion that--
- Whoa! that these bees are definitely not the right sort of tiggers!
It doesn't look good.
Bees! Run!
At last, the day had come to an end... as days often will.
And what had begun as a very exciting idea... had changed to a rather discouraging one.
Tigger?
Uh, I gotta go home now.
Mama will be worried about me.
Tigger?
Oh, what, am I kiddin' myself?
They're not comin'...
'cause I might as well face it-- there aren't any other tiggers.
I guess that means this silly old thing's... just gonna stay empty for... all of forever.
But isn't that the wonderful thing about tiggers... being the only one?
You betcha, Roo boy.
Oh, the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm
The very only
Last, lonely, single... s-s-s-solitary... one.
First, l--
And just so--
And then l--
Like this. And then a little twist, like such.
And then I let it all loose with a--
Oh! Whatever are you doing, Roo, dear?
I'm practising the Whoop-de-Doop-Tee Bounce.
Maybe if I do it really good for Tigger... he wouldn't miss not having a family so much.
But I can't bounce it yet.
Well, I'm sure you'll be able to do it in time, dear.
But Tigger seems awful lonely, don't you think, Mama?
I suppose he might be every now and again.
- Mama?
- Yes, dear?
I wish I had a big brother like Tigger.
Now, why wish that... when you have a Tigger like Tigger?
'Cause then I'd be his little brother... and he'd be just like one of our family.
- Wouldn't that be great?
- But, Roo, dear...
Tigger is one of our family.
And as long as we care for him, he always will be.
Sweet dreams, Roo, dear.
I still wish I could do something to make him feel better.
I say, young Roo, if you suggest that a letter... would bring cheer to our friend Tigger... then we shall, by all means, write one!
Now, uh, what sort of letter is this to be?
It's by us from them to him.
By which from what to whom?
From Tigger's family to Tigger.
Ah, yes!
"Dear Tigger,
Just a note to say--"
Uh, "just a note to say"?
What shall it say?
Well, uh...
I suppose it might say... um, "dress warmly"?
Oh, oh, I see.
Excellent advice.
Oh, Owl?
Perhaps-- "Eat well"?
Good point, Pooh bear.
"Stay safe and sound"?
Oh, a very good idea, Piglet.
"Keep smilin'."
"We're always there for you."
"Wishing you all the best.
Signed, Your Family."
- There.
- Won't Tigger be pleased?
- Yes, yes, how wonderful for Tigger.
- What a splendid idea.
- Nice, everybody.
- Yes, marvellous work, everyone.
And so, the next morning--
Hello, everybody!
Pooh boy!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Pigilet!
Kanga! Kanga!
Roo! Roo! Roo!
Hoo, hoo, hoo!
Eeyore! Eeyore, old buddy!
Look at what I got. A letter, a letter for me! That's who. Hoo, hoo, hoo!
T-l-double-geh-er spells Tigger!
I, uh, wonder who it might be from.
From my very own family!
I knew I had one.
A great big family!
Full of uncles and aunties... and-and grand-tiggers and second-cousin tiggers!
And they're all just like me.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.
Just imaginate it.
Hundreds of thousands of tiggers!
All bouncin' around up there in our huge gigantical family tree!
There's momsey tiggers and popsey tiggers
And tiggers In ever knew
Like sister tiggers and brother tiggers
And cousin tiggers too
There's grandma tiggers and grandpa tiggers as you can plainly see
When we're all together it's ajumpin 'jamboree
'Round, 'round my family tree
I look like them and they look like me
'Round, 'round my family tree
We're a happy family
There's huge slews of nephew tiggers
Uncle tiggers by the ton
There's whippersnappin 'grandpappy tiggers and grandma tiggers are fun
There's skinny, little tiny little thin, little tiggers
Roly-poly tiggers too
But we're all relations and we're quite a mighty crew
'Round, 'round my family tree
I look like them and they look like me
- 'Round, 'round my family tree
We're a happy family
- The Amazing Flying Tiggers!
'Round my family tree
We're a happy family
The firstest-most roots of my family tree
Reach way backin history
To the braverest, fiercerest noblerest tiggers
You'd ever care to see
The heroicest figgers of my ancestor tiggers
Has always been hailed and cheered
And the sculpturous grace of our tiggerous faces
Is why we're all revered
There were warrior tiggers
Explorier tiggers
And tiggers of worldly acclaim
There were glorious fantazmagorious tiggers
With prizes and fortunes and fame
There's the glamorous branch and the amorous branch
Of our fabulous family tree
And when we sing together
We're in perfect harmony
'Round and 'round my family tree
I look like them and they look like me
'Round and 'round my family tree
We're a happy family
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.
There's momsey tiggers and popsey tiggers
And tiggers In ever knew
Hoo, hoo.
Like uncle tiggers and nephewtiggers
And grandma tiggers too
And when we tiggers all get together
We really have a ball
The bounciest, trounciest flounciest, pounciest
Most tiggerifigest
Family reunion of all
Everybody bounce! You know how to do it! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. And-- I'm especially excited about this part-- they miss me somethin' awful!
And they're comin' to see me tomorrow!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
T-T-Tomorrow?
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, Tigger, I can't wait to meet them.
Now, w-w-w-where did it say that exactly?
Exackatackly nowhere, per se...
'cause with us tiggers, you got to read betwixt the lines.
I'm gonna see my whole family! 'Cause my whole family is all comin' to see...
Little old you-know-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Now, Tigger was so enormously excited... that his friends couldn't help but feel, well, a bit concerned.
Tigger?
Tigger?
- Tigger?
- Oh, hiya, Roo.
What are ya doin', Tigger?
Why, I'm buildin' a family room on to my house!
So my family will have plenty of room!
They got to live somewheres after the big family reunitin' party.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
- Party?
- Why, sure!
Boy, it's gonna be great.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
It's all right in my letter.
Speakin' of which, you wanna hear me read it once or thrice again?
- Uh, Tigger--
- "Dear--" They call me "dear."
It's embarrassin', ain't it, the way us tiggers go oozin' oodles and doodles of affection?
- Yeah, but--
- "Dear Tigger--" Ya see that?
Us tiggers always call us tiggers by their firstest names.
"Dress warmly."
They're worried sick about me.
"Eat well. Keep smilin'.
Stay safe and sound."
And here is the best part of all.
"We're always there forya."
Isn't this the all-time greatest?
Yeah, the greatest.
I was gonna tell him, but I couldn't.
Pooh, do you think you could?
Why, certainly, Roo.
Could what?
Tell him, uh, about the letter?
Why, certainly.
Could that be them already?
Tiggers are usually fashion bubbly late.
Welcome, dear brothers, to the house of Tigger!
Oh. Hiya, buddy bear.
You're just in time to help me finish up with the finishin' up.
- Hold these here while I put those there.
- Uh, Tigger... there is a very important matter which I must discuss.
You're right, Pooh boy! I could use another balloon or two dozen.
Um, Tigger?
Hmm. Something isn't right here.
Much better. Now, what'd you want to talk about, Pooh boy?
Pooh?
Perhaps I'll need a bit of help.
Tigger was so very excited... and had so very many things to do... he heard very little of what anyone else was saying.
But as it so happened... none of his friends had the heart to tell Tigger... very much of anything anyway.
Not like he won't find out for himself... sooner or later.
Oh, poor dear.
He'll be so disappointed.
- Oh, d-d-dear.
- Indeed.
Oh, what have we done?
Oh, perhaps his family will come... and everything will be fine.
That's it!
There!
A veritable work of art.
Ah. And just how will this cheer up Tigger?
Uh, well, uh, the stripes look okay.
But what we have to do is act real tiggery.
We gotta do a lot of bouncing... and say a lot of tigger stuff.
Yes, such as,
"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"
"Absoposilutely."
That's kinda sorta like--
Like Tigger, but, um--
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you
Ah!
You've got to look like a tigger
-And-And sound like a tigger
-And act like a tigger too
If we paint black stripes on our underwear
And glue on whiskers too
We're bound to appear far more as tiggers do
Ha, ha. Unquestionably.
Maybe we could all say T. T.F.N. and shout hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
We all might sound a lot more tiggerish too
You think?
And that is how to be a tigger
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you
You've got to look like a tigger and sound like a tigger
And act like a tigger too
If we break things up and knock things down
And leave the place a mess
That's the thing that Tigger does the best
I oughta know.
And if I don't eat honey from the honey pot
Ol' Tigger will plainly see
I must be another tigger because I couldn't possibly be me
And that is how to be a tigger
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you
You've got to look like a tigger and sound like a tigger
And act like a tigger--
Um, also.
Oh! Thank goodness I found you all here.
There's a terrible storm headed for--
What on earth are you doing?
Stripes? Springs?
Have you lost your minds?
You should be covering the windows!
Counting your supplies!
Gathering firewood!
Winter is here, and-and you aren't even ready.
What are you doing wasting your time with--
What am I doing wasting my time?
I've got serious work to do!
At least I haven't lost sight of what's really important.
Well, l-l-l really didn't have enough time... to gather any firewood.
I am down to this...
Last lonely honey pot.
Well, come to think of it, uh... we don't really look or act very much like tiggers.
Thought I was pretty convincing.
Wait! Wait! We gotta do it!
We have to do it!
Think how sad
Tigger's gonna feel.
Oh, but we don't really know how to be a tigger.
Yeah, we do. Um--
If we could all be happy
Full of friendliness and cheer
He'll surely see we are his family
Ah!
We're filled with joy and laughter
And the happiness he starts
Candlelit from the bottom
Of our hearts
And that is how to be a tigger
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you you've got to be like a tigger
-Full of glee like a tigger with a happy
-Hoo, hoo, hoo
- How to be a tigger
- How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you
You've got to be like a tigger full of glee like a tigger
With a happy hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
I wonder where they could be.
What if they got the wrong directions?
What if they strayed off the beaten path?
What if they're out there hopelessly lost?
Clutched in the cruel grasp of winter?
Hold on, tiggers!
I'm comin' to get ya!
Surprise!
Is it-- Is it--
Is it really you... my very own one and only family?
- Yep, yep!
- Come in, come in!
There's a lot of catching' uppin' we gotta do.
We haven't seen each other in--
We haven't seen each other!
Ooh! Ooh.
Um, gee, it's, um, nice... to have all us tiggers gettin' together like this.
- Huh?
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yes.
- Sure.
- It certainly is.
What am l--
Where the heck are my mannerisms?
Uh, uh, r-r-refreshin' refreshyments for all.
Hoo, hoo.
Comin' right up. Hoo, hoo.
Help yourself. Don't be--
Don't be shy. There you go.
Take two, you're small.
I mean, they're small.
- I mean, oh, here, have another. A lot of vitamins and minimals after all.
- Bother.
Oh, um, my, what-- what-- what a nice home you have.
Yes, and what lovely decorations.
So bouncety and, uh, stripedy.
- Nice weather.
- Party flavour?
Now this party's really startin' to pick up. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
- So, what you been up to, cousin?
- I-l-l-- I've been, uh--
Bouncin'! Bouncin', bouncin', mornin' and noon, and noon to night.
Why, that's what I've been doin' too!
It must run in the family.
Hey, who's up for some family-type fun and games?
You look like a fun-lovin' type offella.
I got a great party-type, family-type game we can play.
How about pin the tail on the do--
It looks like you already been playin' it.
- Whew!
- I know.
Let's all do what tiggers do best.
That would be bouncin', of course.
- Oh, yes, what a lovely idea.
- Oh, of course, bouncin' again.
- Yeah!
- Let the bouncin' begin!
Yeah!
Bounce. Bounce.
Oops.
I do enjoy bouncing.
- Bounce, bounce.
- Don't bounce too high now, Roo.
Tigger. Tigger, dear.
You certainly have a wonderful family, Tigger.
Wait a second! We gotta bounce the Whoop-de-Dooper...
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce!
What a tiggerific idea!
Guests first.
You gotta swing your legs up high.
And you twist your tail in tight.
You wind up all your springs... and with your eyes, fix them straight ahead... you let it all loose and go...
"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"
Roo! What are you doin' impersonizin' a tigger?
Piglet?
Kanga. Owl.
- Eeyore!
- Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.
We only wanted to help, Tigger.
Oh. Oh.
Now I understand.
It was all a big joke.
Well, that's all right...
'cause somewhere out there... there's a tigger family tree full of my real tigger family.
I've got a letter to prove it.
And I'm gonna find 'em, so...
T.T.F.E.
Ta-ta forever!
Poor Tigger, all alone in the cold.
He must be very sad... and perhaps lost.
And maybe even a bit... hungry.
Bother.
Pooh, you gotta help me find Tigger.
It's all my fault.
He never would have left if it wasn't 'cause of me.
I didn't mean to make him feel bad.
I just-- I-l just wanted him to-- to be my big brother.
Oh. Oh.
We gotta go find him.
We just gotta.
And so we will.
What we need is-- think, think, think-- an exposition.
- An expotition?
- Yes.
To the place where Tigger is.
Or was. Or will be?
I believe Rabbit should lead us.
- Rabbit?
- Oh, yes.
He's the only one who ever says he knows what he's doing.
Absolutely not.
I mean, uh--
Well, after all, he, uh--
I-It was not, uh, my-- he, um--
He wanted to leave, uh, didn't he?
But, Rabbit--
He could always give that extra little push... when you needed it.
Oh, thank you, Roo.
I-It was n-nice to have him here when things were fr-frightful.
Sort of lit up the room when he came in.
Uh, well, uh--
Y-- Well--
What do you need, uh, me for?
Why don't you, uh, go find him yourselves?
But we're just not clever enough,
Rabbit.
Rabbit. I miss him.
Well, l, uh, oh--
Oh, very well.
- Tigger.
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger.
Now, now, uh, careful, everyone.
It's a bit windy!
Are you all right, Eeyore?
Eeyore? Oh! Oh, d-d-dear!
- Help! Ooh!
- Uh, we must take care... to stick together.
Perhaps not this stuck, Piglet.
P-P-P-Pardon me, P-Pooh.
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Where are ya?
- Tigger!
Tiggers!
Tiggers!
Where are you, tiggerseses?
I-- I hope they're all okay.
Tiggers!
Tiggers! Whoa! Whoa!
The biggest, hugest... and most gigantical, stripedy tree... in all the entire
Hundred Acre Woodses!
Is it-- Is it--
My family tree!
My family tree!
I found it. I found it.
I can't believe it!
Hello! Hello up there!
Where are you, tiggers?
It's me, Tigger!
Hello! Hello, family!
I got your letter, and-- and I came to see ya!
Hello!
Hello?
Hello?
Maybe they forgot I was comin'.
But...
I thought-- I thought you were always there for me.
- Tigger.
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Where are you, Tigger?
- T-Tig-- g-g-g-er!
Oh, th-th-th-th-than-- th-th-th-th-th--
Oh, you're-- you're welcome.
Tigger!
"Dear Tigger."
Tigger? Is that you?
Tigger! Tigger, it's me, Roo!
- Down here!
- Oh, Tigger. Thank goodness.
- Tigger! Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger! Tigger!
- What? Hello? Did s--
- Could it be?
- Tigger, look. Tigger, down here.
It looks like the whole family is finally here!
I'm comin', tiggers!
Tiggers! Tiggers!
- Hey, you're not tiggers.
- It's so wonderful.
What are you guyses doin' here?
"Doing"?
What are we doing here?
We came all this way to look for you.
Now-- Now forget about all this "other tiggers" nonsense... and, uh, come home.
Nonsense?
No! No!
No! No! No! No!
Are you, uh-- Are you crazy?
- It's not safe out here.
- Exactakly!
That's why you should all go home where it is safe.
But I've gotta wait here in my family tree... for my real family!
Family! Family! Family!
- Family!
- Is that a rumbly in your tumbly, Pooh?
I don't think so, Piglet.
Come on, hurry up.
No time for dawdling.
Not a second to waste.
Watch yourself there, Roo boy.
Take care, Pooh bear!
Don't be scared, Piglet.
Up ya go, donkey boy!
Help! Oh, no, no!
Tigger!
Oh, no! Oh!
The Whoop-de-Dooper,
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce.
The more you try, the more you fly.
And that's what really counts!
Tigger! Tigger!
Wake up, Tigger!
Wake up!
Tigger?
- Yes!
- We're alive!
- You saved him, Roo.
- That was just wonderful, Roo.
- Oh, Roo, that was very brave.
- Hooray.
What a Whoop-de-Doopin',
Loop-de-Loopin'
Ali-Oopin' Bounce that was!
It was, wasn't it?
I mean, I really did it, didn't l?
Did ya?
Come here, you. Why, that bounce was just as good as any old tigger fa--
Tigger... family member.
Tigger?
Please don't go.
There they are.
We found them.
We found them.
- There's Tigger!
- Roo! Oh, Roo.
- Mama! Mama!
- We've been searching all over for you.
- How wonderful.
Oh, Roo, dear,
I was so worried.
I'm sorry, Mama.
- I'm all right.
- Oh, my little Roo.
Pooh bear!
- Pooh bear!
- Christopher Robin.
Pooh bear! Pooh!
There you are.
- Silly old bear.
- Oh, my!
- Nice to see ya.
- Where have you all been?
We were looking for Tigger looking for Tigger's family.
Tigger's family?
You didn't have to go looking for them.
But-- But I got a letter, and-- and it said that-- that--
It was right-- Oh.
I must have lost it in the avalanchee.
I can't even remember the words.
Dear Tigger, just a note to say--
Dress warmly.
- Eat well.
- Stay safe and sound.
Keep smilin'.
We're always there for you.
- Signed--
- Your family.
You mean you fell as are my family?
I'm afraid we have nothing better to offer.
Well, of course not, Pooh boy...
'cause there's nothin' better than the best!
I should have seen it all along.
Spotted you a mile away.
Then the whole mountain came down on top of us.
- But Tigger saved us!
- I wasn't worried at all... except for the part where I was worried, of course.
Ahem, ahoom and et cetera.
In honour of this most occasional occasion... my firs test ever family reunitin'...
I'd like to present each ofya with a present!
Firs test, for Eeyore!
A new family room for your lovely home.
Seems kind of big.
Bit on the comfy side.
Not very drafty.
But I suppose
I'll get used to it.
I love parties so much.
And for Pooh boy, enough honey to last all winter.
Or till next Thursday anyways.
Why, thank you, Tigger.
It looks good enough to eat.
And for Piglet, old pal, a winter's worth of firewood.
- Keep warm.
- Oh, thank you, Tigger!
Well, you're very welcome.
I think I'll eat a piece myself.
And for you, long ears,
I promise from now on...
I'll always watch where I'm bouncin'.
Oh, well, thank you, uh, uh, Tigger.
Bravo, Tigger! Bravo, I say.
Very well done indeed.
- I'm very impressed.
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you, Tigger.
- Thank you so much, Tigger.
- Oh, look at this.
- Whoa!
You didn't think I was gonna disremember you, did ya?
Go on. Go on. Open her up.
It's all yours.
Is it really for me, Tigger?
Only the best for my bestest little brother.
Wait halfa minute.
We still need a family portrait to put in it.
Look this way, everybody.
Closer.
Smile.
Sunny days and starry nights
And lazy afternoons
You're countin 'castles in the clouds
And hummin' little tunes
But somehow right before your eyes
The summer fades away
Everything is different
And everything has changed
If you feel lost
And on your own
And far from home
You're never alone, you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waitin' there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you
Home
Funny how photograph
Can take you backin time
To places and embraces
That you thought you'd left behind
They're tryin' to remind you
That you're not the only one
That no one is an island
When all is said and done
If you feel lost
And on your own
And far from home
You're never alone, you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waitin' there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you
Home
There'll come a day
When you're losin' your way
And you won't know where
You belong
They say that home is where the heart is
So follow your heart
And know that you can't go wrong
If you feel lost
And on your own
And far from home
You're never alone, you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waitin' there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you
- If you feel lost
- Lost and on your own
And far from home
You're never alone, you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waitin' there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you
Where you belong
I know your heart
Will lead you
Home
This blade has a dark past.
It has shed much innocent blood.
You're a fool for traveling alone, so completely unprepared.
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.
Thank you.
So...
What brings you to the land of the gatekeepers?
I'm searching for someone.
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?
A dragon.
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.
I've been alone for as long as I can remember.
We're almost done. Shhh...
Hey, sit still.
Good night, Scales.
Get him, Scales! Come on!
Scales?
Yeah! Come on!
Scales!
I have failed.
You've only failed to see...
These are dragon lands, Sintel.
You are closer than you know.
Scales!
Scales?
Scales...

[Laughter]
- [Tyres screech]
- Hey, move out of the way you crazy turtle!
Humans, huh...
..seems to me like they're always in a hurry, but they have nowhere to go.
That was my old mate Ray back there.
He almost got himself run over.
Huh!
We were born on this very same beach, some fifty years ago, and we've been mates ever since.
Today is a special day, we're both going to be granddads. Imagine that!
'It could take awhile before the little ones hatch though,
'so, let me take you back in time,
'and tell you about our first encounter with the humans.
'There was a time when this beach was practically deserted.
'Nothing out here but us turtles,
'and the sound of those beautiful waves.'
Ohh!
[Seagulls screeching]
Oh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Hey, come on, you need to hustle a flipper!
I can't get out!
Let's go... to the water.
We're wasting time.
See you in 30 years!
Or not!
Ohh!
Oomph!
Ohh!
[Sighs]
[Seagulls screeching]
Hello... hello?
Is anybody up there?
'I was only five minutes old and already I had the sinking feeling
'that I was not going to make it.'
[Screeches]
Ahh!
[Squawks]
Help, let me go!
Ah!
Oh!
Ohh!
Oh-ho, oh!
Hi there!
Watch out!
Ahh!
WOO!
That was well cool with those birds, eh?
It was as if we were flying!
- [Groans]
- You know, you don't look too good.
[Groans]
- Can you move?
- Huh?
We have to get going.
We've got some good waves coming in now.
Come on, we gotta go, Shelly!
Birds are everywhere!
Wait, we have to help him!
Come on, Shelly.
There's nothing more you can do for him.
Shelly?
Oh!
Come on, don't give up.
You can still make it!
You have to try.
Get up, I'll help you.
[Screeching]
Ah, let go!
Help me, help!
Shelly?
[Gasps]
[Sighs]
Oh!
'And so it began for me.
'A little nudge to start me off.
'Nonetheless, I was on my way.'
# Let this love be a fading sky #
# We could drift all night
  to the new sunrise #
# Because we'll be free #
# I know you know you're free #
# Feels so good to be free #
# Mm-mm, baby #
# Free #
# There's nothing in between #
# What we are, what we've seen #
# What we are #
# We are just free #
# Free #
# Free... #
[Grunts]
Oh! Ohh!
Ohh!
Oh, hi there, new to the current?
Hatched yesterday.
You're awful young to be alone out here.
It can get really scary.
Scary?
It is a big pond out here, in case you hadn't noticed!
Lots of creatures out to get you, as you'll find out soon enough.
- Find out what?
- Where do I start?
- Well, what about barracuda?
- Barra what?
Cudas, fastest predator in the ocean!
- And you got your Great Whites!
- White?
Faster than the fastest, they are, and big teeth, too.
Oh, never mind them.
Just go with your instincts, and you'll be fine. No reason to be scared.
I'm not scared.
Well you should be!
You're not even a snack for most creatures out here!
Just follow your instincts, and good luck on your journey.
What am I supposed to be looking for?
When you find out, let us know!
And watch out for the nets.
If they get you, you're turtle soup!
And watch out for the plastic.
Seaweed good, plastic bad.
OW!
What did you do that for?
Do I look like food to you?
Oh, crazy fish!
What a way to start the journey.
Hmm.
Ah!
How's it going, guys?
Looking mighty cosy up here.
- Get off, you big oaf.
- [All] Yeah!
Who put a dent in your shell?
He's gonna eat all our food.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Get out of here!
- Yeah.
Go! We don't need some eating machine hanging around! Sling your hook!
I wouldn't ride on your stupid whatever, if you were the last turtles in the ocean!
- Good!
- Go away!
Hiya, fellas.
Hoy-oy-oy, don't even think about it!
Beat it!
All right, I'm not one of your kind.
Got that right!
- Hey, watch out!
- Ow!
Ah, this is not my day!
Now why'd you whack me upside my head?
But, I...
Lucky I didn't pass out!
Look at that!
Got a bump the size of a barnacle.
Probably get bigger, take over my whole head.
I, I, I don't think it will...
You ever seen them barnacles?
You let 'em hitch a ride with you, they never leave, bunch of freeloaders!
Hello?
Oh! Goodbye.
What is that thing you're on anyway?
You make it?
Oh, I fell on it.
It's a long story.
How's your bump?
Ah, no worries.
Us Leathers got heads like rocks.
The name's Ray.
Sammy.
Pleased to meet you.
How long you been on the journey?
- Just one day.
- Me too! Caught the drift up north.
- So did I!
- Say!
We have a lot in common, you and me.
- Would you like to hop on?
- Nah, I'm OK.
Oh, OK.
It was a joke!
You know, seeing how we're supposed to be floatin' around until we grow up and all, this little raft of yours could come in handy.
This ain't bad.
Now, you're sure about this?
I don't wanna get all friendly like and then you go crackers on me one day,,
- and wanna kick me off.
- I wouldn't do that.
Besides, we were hatched on the same day, probably on the same beach!
We're practically brothers.
Brothers...
I like that.
Ah, the sun feels good, doesn't it?
I like laying out in the sun. it's good for my skin, cos you know, when a turtle, you know, gets all dried up, everything gets all ugly and flaky, but I like that.
I like that, it's good to have a turtle tan.
'And that's how I met Ray.
'He was definitely a character.
'Always fun and never at a loss for words.
'For ten years or so our life in the open sea,
'consisted mainly of floating and waiting.'
You should try some. it's good!
You've got to be kidding. My taste buds are a little more refined.
[Laughs]
That's what you call refined?
Hoo, I love 'em!
[Burps]
They do gimme gas though.
[Laughs]
# I'm feeling happy #
# And warm all over #
# I hold you in my hand #
# And you spillover #
# So come on,
  we're having a good time #
# We're happy people,
  We're having the best time ever #
# We're happy people,
      Oh-oh #
# Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh #
# Oh-oh-oh-oh... #
'You know, despite all the stories I heard,
'the ocean didn't seem like a scary place after all.'
# I'm the way it should be #
# So come on,
  we're having a good time #
# We're happy people,
  We're having the best time ever #
# We're happy people,
        oh-oh #
# Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh #
[Horn blasts]
# Why don't you take a look around #
- [Both laugh]
# Take a look all around you #
# I'm feeling happy
 Take a look around #
# And warm all over
 Take a look all around #
# I hold you in my hand
Take a look around #
# And you spill over... #
'It was a pretty great life out here.
'Time just seemed to fly by.
'Before we knew it we had...
Well, we had grown up.
'Well, almost grown up, that is.'
Oh, this is the life, my friend.
No gas problems today, Ray?
I'm feelin' pretty good.
By the way, did you notice those two cuties leaving
- when we were comin' in?
- Nope, didn't see them.
Come on, they were checking you out!
- No, they weren't.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, do you think we'll be pals forever?
Of course, forever and ever.
- Don't you?
- Definitely.
But, at some point, now I'm not saying now, but, some time in the future, well, we're gonna have to choose a mate, right?
OK. So?
Have you ever thought about finding that someone special?
I suppose.
So, what's your type?
- I don't know.
- Come on, everybody's got a type.
For me, she's gotta have a great laugh, and of course, share my thing for jellyfish.
Of course.
You still haven't told me what your type is?
Actually, I met someone once that I think could be my type.
Oh, really?
Well, come on, come on, this is major! You gotta tell me!
You're gonna make more of it than it actually was.
You already made more of it!
OK.
- Her name's Shelly.
- Go on.
She was... she was kind of sweet.
Mm.
Where'd you meet her?
She was um... an important part of my early life.
What?
We met a day after you hatched, been together ever since, and she's a big part of your life?
- She is!
-Mm?
- Was.
- Well, OK, I want all the juicy details.
There are no juicy details.
Start talkin' or I don't stop bugging you.
OK, OK, fine.
- Come on, I'm listening.
- [Laughs]
Wow, that was some story.
You saved her life.
It was more of an accident.
The birds collided.
You spit sand in that bird's face.
You saved her life!
I don't even know if she made it.
There you are, you never know.
It's a small ocean out there.
Maybe someday me and you'll run into her.
- Maybe.
- [Both] Ah!
- Whoo!
- Ha-ha, is this great or what?
Better than great!
'Ray was truly the best friend
I could have hoped for.
'He was always fun.
'Always good humoured and always looking for new adventures.
'One thing though, I could have done without his stinky jellyfish.'
[Crash]
[Groans]
[Alarms]
[Crash]
'Come on, don't give up.'
You can still make it!
You have to try.
Get up!
- Come on Sammy, get up!
- Oh!
It's about time you woke up.
What?
Oh.
What have you been doing?
Exploring! Made friends with a cool old octopus.
You gotta check him out.
Have you eaten yet?
I'll get something on the wing.
Picky, picky, picky.
Where are you taking me to?
You'll see, we're almost there.
Hey, Slim!
Well, hello!
Grab on, boys!
Come on, Sammy, you're not scared, are you?
No, of course not.
Come on then! it's gonna be fantastic!
- Welcome aboard.
- Here we go!
Pick a tentacle, any tentacle.
Fasten your seatbelts, it's going be a bumpy ride.
Here we go!
Round and round and round.
Love it!
I Teach you to carry on
I Watch now, but now it's gone away... I
Oh!
Woo-hoo.
So was that fun or what?
My head's still spinning.
- Where's everybody going?
- Whoa, we've got a situation here!
What's going on?
It doesn't look good.
- Smells bad too.
- Oh!
What is this stuff?
It's all around us!
We'd better take cover!
We'll be safe in here... I think.
Slim, you ever seen anything like this?
No, not like this.
However, I do remember a cargo ship once ran aground on some rocks, and dropped a whole batch of Icelandic bananas!
These aren't bananas.
Most certainly not.
Oh.
Good lord, that's disgusting!
I'll wager a guinea that that ship is rammed to the gunnels with the stuff.
You chaps should head out, it's not safe staying around here.
What about you, Slim?
Oh, Slim'll be fine.
I like staying put.
I'm a hermit, not the crab, you understand.
But anyway,
I've got a lot of cleaning up to do.
Take care my turtle friends.
- Thanks.
- Take care of yourself!
This looks horrible.
It was so beautiful here.
Why would anybody do this to us?
I don't know, it doesn't make any sense at all.
[Helicopter]
'Humans were strange creatures.
'Some made a mess, while others cleaned it up.
'That was our first contact with humans.
'It wouldn't be our last.
'Over the years, I learned that many things would change,
'but one thing was always a constant.
' People would affect our lives
'more and more.'
[BANG!]
Wow, what was that?
That hurt my ears.
Look at that!
What is it?
Some kind of aliens?
No, humans.
They're everywhere.
I think we need to get out of here.
This is a little too close for comfort.
Hey!
What did ya do that for?
There's no room on here, especially for your stinky jellyfish.
What are you talking about?
We can't even move on here any more.
Maybe I should just take my jellyfish and hit the current myself!
Then you could stretch out and have all the space to yourself.
- I wasn't saying you had to...
- Whoa...
Uh-ooh!
Well, there you go.
I guess we won't have to worry about being crowded any more, now will we!
Look, Ray, I...
What?
What's the rush, guys?
Oh, Ray!
The net, it's got me!
Hold on, I'll get you out of there.
Don't panic.
I'll tear this thing up.
I already tried.
It's too hard!
I can't bite through it!
Ah!
- Ray!
- Sammy!
Wait for me here! I'll find a way out.
I'll be right here, Sammy!
You hear me?
Right here!
Ah, they got me.
- Sammy?
- Ray?
We'll get out of this.
'That was the first time that I saw real fear on Ray's face.'
- Sammy!
- 'I was pretty scared myself]
Sammy!
Oh!
Ohh!
[Grunts]
Ohh!
Oh!
Whoa!
Oh!
Ah. Oh!
Ahh!
[Grunts]
[Sighs] Oh, Ray.
'This was one of those times
I could've used a little luck,
'one of those little nudges.
'I had the feeling
I was never going to see Ray again.'
Gotta be thirty degrees out here.
Away with you, I'll give it 35.
What you got there then, boy?
It's a little greenback.
Think we should we make some soup?
- [Both laugh]
- That little boy's overcooked already!
Chuck him!
[Both continue to laugh]
[Groans]
# Oh-ho-ho #
# If you ever find yourself
  stuck in the middle of the sea #
# I'll sail the world to find you #
# If you ever find yourself lost in the dark
        and you can't see #
# I'll be the light to guide you #

  are supposed to do, oh, yeah... #
Hey, what's this?
Oh, isn't he a cute little turtle?
See turtle, Fluffy?
- See?
- He looks so scared, doesn't he?
We'll get him some food, and we'll take real good care of him.
OK?
Fluffy, turtle eat food.
And it's time for your dinner, too.
[French accent] OK, let's get one thing straight, little turtle.
-these are my humans.
- I didn't ask to be here.
Your humans brought me here.
If I may suggest, you should plan on getting your little shell out of here as soon as possible, unless of course, you prefer to end up like my ex-amis, ze chicken.
- Chicken?
- Absolument!
Whose playpen do you think this was?
They eat animals?
But she seems so nice.
Do not let the mumsy-wumsy attitude fool you.
She will stuff you like a goose, then, it is r-r-r, pâté for everyone.
Shh, here she comes now!
Here you go, little man.
You are so skinny.
We need to fatten you up, don't we?
Come here, don't be afraid.
Do not forget.
You have been warned.
Bon appétit!
"You have a strange way, Ralph,
"of proving that the world has grown smaller.
"So, because you can go round it in three months..."
"In eighty days," interrupted Phileas Fogg.
"That's true, gentlemen," added John Sullivan.
"Only eighty days, now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad,
“on the Great Indian
Peninsular Railway, has been opened.“
So, have you given any more thought to your escape?
You are starting to look like ze fat goose more and more every day.
Ze time will come. it's a sure thing.
You and your chicken stories!
Is it true? Can you really go around the world?
But of course you can!
I myself have travelled all over with my humans.
Since they rescued me from the murky waters of the Seine in Paris, oo-la-la, it has been magnifique!
So, wait, there are other oceans out there?
'One day, Snow found a female turtle.
I think she wanted us to...'
Mate!
You've got to be kidding!
I suppose she wants more turtles.
I know what mating is.
That is so not happening.
And who's your hairy friend?
That's Fluffy.
These are his humans.
Exactement! You just stay away from my humans, sister.
Oh, you can keep your humans as far as I'm concerned.
Bunch of wack-a-doodle-doo creatures!
The further away from them I am, the better.
Tell me, sugar, how long have they been holding you prisoner?
I'm not a prisoner.
Really, then why are you still here?
This is the same question
I have been asking for weeks!
Back off, whiskers.
Let me break it down for you.
Where I come from, this here fence looks a lot like a prison, but, OK, believe what you will if it makes you feel better.
Fluffy!
Dinner calls! À bientôt!
- I'm Sammy.
- Vera.
Speaking of dinner,
I am starving!
Do they just feed hairball or us, too?
Yeah, when the sun goes down.
Beautiful!
Don't make any sudden moves on me.
Go ahead and give us a wake-up call when it's time to eat, will you?
[Yawns]
[Sitar music plays]
There you go.
You'll be our little peace ambassador.
Merry Christmas, little man.
Hey, what did she paint on my shell?
Turn around, let me see.
It is zat, stupid... ze sign!
What can I say.
I have told you.
You are marked, mon ami.
Oh, there you go again with the chicken and the funny words routine.
Never mind him, Sammy.
It looks cute on you.
Why do you think they dress up like that with those silly hats?
Incroyable!
You really don't get it?
Because it's Christmas!
You get presents.
Hey, maybe this mark is Snow's present to me.
Doubtful.
In any event, don't get any ideas,
Monsieur Hard Shell.
She is only being nice because it's Christmas.
? Jingle bells
? Jingle bells
? Jingle all... ?
'I still don't know if Fluffy's chicken story was true or not.
'I wanted to believe Snow was a kind human and wouldn't do that to me.
'But you never knew, when it came to humans.
'It didn't take long before the hippies realised,
'Vera and I weren't going to mate.
'They said we had different karmas...
'or auras - whatever they were.'
Zat should be you out there.
Hold on, I thought you liked Vera?
Vera's too old and too tough for turtle soup.
But you...
- Ow!
- ..I'd say you were just about right!
Vera!
[Man] None of you kids belong on this beach! I want you all off here now!
Snow, they're taking Sunshine away!
[Sirens]
The cops! The army!
They're shipping them out to Vietnam!
[Man] You with the love beads, start that bus up.
Vite, vite, go, go, go!
What's going on?
You, you're coming with us.
This is it, it's chicken time.
You have to hide now!
They did the same thing before.
They... you know what I mean.
Stay put, and don't move.
You don't want to end up as fricassee, do you?
[Man] All right, shake a leg.
Come on, get out of it.
[Young man] We have rights, man.
[Snow] Wait.
Where's the little man?
Has anybody seen him?
I can't find him.
Quiet.
[Man] Right, you horrible lot, everybody get off this beach.
Get your stuff and move out!
[Sirens]
Have a good life little turtle!
Peace.
"The whole time I was with the humans,
Fluffy wanted to get rid of me",
"but in the end, it was them who left".
"I never quite understood what happened".

Oh, hey, excuse me.
You wouldn't know where I could find some food, sea weeds?
[Sighs]
'At that point I thought, maybe
I wasn't meant to go on this journey.
'Maybe I'd spent too much time with the humans.
'But there was no turning back now.'
Oh!
[Grunts]
Argh!
Well, well, well, look what the trash brought in!
Vera!
I see you escaped one prison and got yourself all tangled up in another.
I'm so glad to see you.
Yeah, lots of rubbish out here.
Got to be careful.
What brings you here?
- Food.
- Yeah!
Follow me.
What did I tell you?
This is just what I needed.
[Faint] Help!
Hold on a sec, what's that noise?
- I didn't hear anything.
- [Faint] Oh, oh!
- This is so tasty!
- [Screams]
Shh!
Ah-ha! Shark!
Help! Help!
[Screams]
Oh!
- Are you hurt?
- He bit me pretty hard but I'm fine.
He's coming back.
Quick, this way.
Hurry, he's gaining on us.
Quickly. Here.
- [Screams]
- Oh!
Quick!
In here.
. Oh!
. Oh!
Ohh! Quick, no!
- Keep going!
- Oh!
Faster, faster!
- Ohh!
- [Screams]
Come on, keep going!
[Both gasping]
Keep going! Down here!
Ohh!
That was close!
Too close.
[Screams]
Leave us alone!
Hey you, big teeth!
That's right, hot shot!
I got your scaly botty on my radar!
You picked the wrong turtle to be messing with!
Ohh, you want some of this?
[Grunts]
Is that all you've got?
I'm gonna call you the Great Wimp not the Great White! Ah!
- Oh, no!
-Vera!
Hey, you think that hurts?
What?
Please!
That's all you got?
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna make cat food out of you, pal!
Look at you,
I've got one tough shell, fish breath!
You heard me.
And don't make me swim after you!
Woo, that felt good.
No need to worry about mister shark any more.
You were incredible!
Are you two related?
No, we're just friends, well, sort of.
Well, got to go.
Feed the boy, cos, a fat turtle is a happy turtle.
Take care you two.
You know, you don't look too good.
Are you OK?
'Don't give up.
You can still make it! You have to try.'
[Gasps] You're...
Wait, you're... you're Shelly!
How do you know my name?
Is this a dream?
No, I, I don't think so.
Are you the same "fell out of a bird's beak when you were hatched," Shelly?
Just a minute.
[Gasps]
I knew you looked familiar, too!
You saved my life - twice!
What? No!
The first time was an accident.
That was no accident, that was fate.
You know,
I don't even know your name.
Sammy.
Well, Sammy, this is incredible!
It is, isn't it?
How's your shell?
It's just a scratch.
Are you as hungry as I am?
Famished!
'Life is strange.
'Just when you thought the going was pretty tough,
'out of the blue things happen,
'and everything's suddenly great again.'
Hey, Shell, you ever get bored just drifting, going round in circles?
It's what we do.
I know, but wouldn't it be great just to travel around the world?
What do you mean?
This is our world.
I think there's a lot more than these waters.
For instance?
Well, the humans talk about ice oceans and strange islands.
I want to see them!
You're definitely a different type of turtle.
- I guess that's why I like you.
- [Gasps] You like me?
What's not to like?
So, just how exactly do you plan on seeing the world?
Have you ever heard about a secret passage?
You really think one exists?
- I do.
- The humans again?
Maybe they made that whole thing up.
Maybe, but I want to do something no one else has done.
I want to see the world, ice oceans!
So, you wanna come along with a weirdo turtle like me?
Is this a proposition, Sammy?
Yes, I suppose it is.
- I'd love to go with you.
- [Gasps] Really?
It's not every day you get a chance to see the world, right?
How do we find this secret passage?
I'm not sure.
Let's head south, we'll ask around.
'Everything suddenly fell into place.
'I had a purpose, a journey.
'And best of all, someone to share it with.'
? Destiny is a funny thing
? We hear people say things are meant to be... ?
All I know is that I see a lot of ships heading that way.
A secret passage?
That, I couldn't tell you.
I stay as far away from those humans as possible.
That must be the way! I feel it!
I feel it, too!
Good luck!
? Never to feel love
? And you will see that nothing at all is impossible
? Because love will find a way... ?
There's loads of boats.
I don't see any secret passage.
Let's move on.
Of course he's not crazy!
We have a plan.
We want to see the world.
Thanks anyway.
This is not as easy as I thought.
Wait! Over there!
? Because mountains and valleys may come between us
? But time nor space will ever defeat us
? And you will see that nothing at all is impossible... ?
This is not the secret passage.
Look at all this nasty stuff around here.
This can't be it.
I think you're right.
[Birdsong]
Taste the water!
- It's sweet!
- Wait!
I remember the humans mentioned something about sweet water
- flowing through the secret passage.
- Do you think we're close?
Yeah! This must be it.
Let's check it out.
It's so different and so beautiful.
It's amazing!
[Bird call]
Wow, did you see that?
There's birds everywhere!
We've got to be careful.
Look at that! I've never seen a snake that big in the ocean.
Maybe he's the guardian of the secret passage.
- [Hisses]
- Let's keep going.
That is one strange looking beast.
It looks like a real monster.
[Gasps]
Did you see that?
- What?
- I'm not sure.
I feel like we're being followed.
[Gasps]
Sammy? Ohh!
I don't think they're anything to worry about. They're not that big.
OW!
Ah!
True, unless you count the fact they have a whole lot of nasty teeth...
There seem to be quite a lot of them.
[Growls]
- [Growls]
- [Scream]
See, I told you they were...
- Ah!
- Sammy!
Let me go!
Ahh! Ahh!
[Grunts]
Why did you bring me up here?
- [Cheeping]
- Ow!
OW! Ow!
Stop it!
Ow! Cut it out!
[Gasps]
- [Cheeping]
- Ahh, cut it out!
[Chainsaw]
[Screams]
Great!
Now how do I get down?
Oh!
[Ship horn]
[Sawing continues]
Ohh!
[Screams]
Oh!
Sammy, I was so frightened!
I thought I'd lost you forever.
[Gasps] Duck!
Maybe looking for the secret passage is a bad idea!
I think I know where it is!
When I was up in that tree,
I saw all these big ships heading towards a place in the distance.
I think we're close.
Really close!
[Ship horn]
We made it!
You were right!
Yeah, and getting through is gonna be another story.
Sammy, you're too close!
Follow me!
We've gotta get ahead of the ship!
Maybe we should go back!
They already closed the door behind us.
We've come this far!
We can make it!
Oh!
Oh!
- Sammy!
- Shelly!
I can't hold onto the rope!
Hold on, I'm coming to get you.
- Sammy!
- Stay! Stay!
Hold on. Just hold on!
- [Screams]
- Shelly!
- Help!
- No, no, no!
Shelly? Shelly!
Shelly, where are you?
Shelly?
Shelly? Shelly?.
Oh!
Shelly! Shelly.
Oh!
Ohh!
Argh!
Oh!
Ohh!
Ahh!
[Gasps]
Ohh!
Oh, Shelly!
'Losing Shelly was all my fault.
'My big idea to see the world, and now here it was.'
? Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
? it's not warm when she's away
? Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
? And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away... ?
Yo, what's up with you?
- Nothing.
- Is you lost?
I suppose I am.
? ..when she's gone
? Wonder if she's gone to stay
? Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
? And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away
? Anytime she goes away
? Mm-mm-mm-mm
? And I know, I know, I know, I know
? I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know... ?
- Well, hello there, young turtle!
- Hi.
What's that funny looking mark on your shell?
Humans painted it on me.
Oh, you poor thing.
No, it's not what you think.
You're the second turtle we've met with a strange mark on its shell.
A shark bite?
Yeah, I think that's what she said it was.
Yes, I think you're right, dear.
Oh, she was a lovely female, too.
A bit strange though.
Sure was! Told us some crazy story about going through a secret passage, heading for the ice oceans.
You sure she said secret passageway?
Heard her plain as day!
Indeed we did.
She was going on and on and on about sweet water, giant ships...
That's Shelly!
Why, I do believe that was her name.
Shelly's alive! She's alive!
Oh, thank you, thank you!
You just made me the happiest turtle in the whole ocean! Thank you!
Good luck, dear.
We truly hope you find your mate.
Oh, to be young and in love again.
'I searched everywhere.
'I talked to anyone who would listen.
'For a long time, Shelly seemed to have vanished without trace.
'But, once in awhile,
I'd come across turtles who'd seen her.
'They gave me hope, fleeting as it was,
'because every time
I was close to finding her,
'I'd lose all trace of her again.
'If only she had known
I was looking for her.”
? I've been searching
? Across the lonely water
? Arms wide open to take you
? Seems like forever
? Since we last were laughing
? Do you remember it the way I do?
? Just know you never are alone
? We just need to find our way back home
? You're not alone
? We just need to find our way... ?
Hey there, turtle!
What's that crazy do-malarkey on your shell there?
Helipad or something?
It's a human marking.
- A peace sign.
- Peace sign?
Where have I heard that before?
Thinking, thinking, och aye, that's what she called it.
- Who?
- Oh, a cute little greenback like you.
Big talker she was.
Going on about sweet water, a secret passage, and propellers!
You saw Shelly?
I sure did!
She had to go to the ice ocean.
Made no sense to me, but then again what do I know, I'm just a bird,
- you're the turtle.
- I've gotta get there, fast!
Hold on, it's mighty cold there.
Please, just tell me how I get there!
This current you're on will get you there in no time.
- Wouldn't stay there too long, though.
- Ow!
Frozen stiff ain't too attractive, if you know what I mean.
[Laughs]
Gotta fly, got a date with a pelican.
'Funny how things had a way of repeating themselves.
'I guess it was all a matter of circumstance and how you looked at it.
'This time around, strangely enough,
I was really happy to see a bird.'
[Thunderclap]
[Thunderclap]
[Wind howling]
I say, little man, what's that you're riding on?
I don't know.
The humans threw it away.
I think it's some kind of boat.
Looks pretty seaworthy.
What brings you to these waters?
You're a long way from where you should be?
I, I know. I'm freezing.
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for...
Look out!
Oh!
Put down your weapons!
You cannot do this!
You're in violation of the law!
The world is watching!
- Hey, look at that! It's a green turtle!
- Give me a hand.
Pull him up here.
- You found another one?
- Yeah, you believe that?
What are they doing in this part of the world?
I know the climate's changing, but turtles in Antarctica?
That's crazy.
Shelly?
[Barks]
[Barks]
[Chattering]
[Trims]
[Trims]
Here you go, my friend.
[Man] Her vital signs are good.
She's made a remarkable recovery.
We'll give her one last check up when we get back to base, then we'll tag her and she's good to go.
Yes, I was right, it is you!
I've got to get out of here.
[Bangs wall]
Open! Open!
Shelly? Oh.
Oh!
- Shelly!
- [All chatter excitedly]
Sammy?
[Mimics] Sammy!
[All chatter at once]
Hey, easy! You're gonna hurt yourself if you fall off there.
All right, all right everybody.
Shush!
Shelly, is that you?
Not today.
Sorry,
I thought you were someone else.
Do you know what's going to happen to us?
I heard the humans talking about this place.
They're gonna take good care of us, put some kind of tag on us, and release us back into the ocean, man.
I say, "Relax and enjoy the food.“
I heard they got good cheese Fritos, man, and that stuff is good.
OK?
Level
Easy.
Sacré bleu!
Well, look who it is!
You are so fat, mon ami.
Oh, it's you, Fluffy.
But of course it's me! Don't I look just as fantastique as ever?
I should be mad at you for tricking me that day on the beach.
Oh, yes, ze chicken story.
Well, you got me zere.
I made it all up.
I was a little more insecure back then.
You're not going to hold a grudge, are you?
No. it's good to see you, Fluffy.
You, too, mon frére.
So, how did you end up in here?
I practically got myself frozen in the ice ocean.
Really?
So you did it, you went and saw the world after all?
Yes.
But you do not sound too happy about it. Pourquoi?
It's a long story.
Oh, mon dieu, speaking of stories,
I have to admit I did miss you, whenever Snow started reading her books to me.
Snow's here?
Mais out! Somewhere.
- Shelly!
- Shelly? Who is that?
Never mind! You have to help me get out of here, now!
OK, OK. For being so slow, you turtles are always in a hurry.
Fluffy!
What do you want me to do?
I need you to get the door open.
Certain.
What are doing in there bothering the animals, again, Fluffy?
Oh, I don't believe it.
Fluffy, you recognised him?
It's our little peace ambassador.
Look at you, little man, all grown up.
What happened to you?
How did you get here?
I was afraid you wouldn't make it after I dumped you on the beach.
It's so good to see you.
I know, I know, you're in a hurry to get back to the sea, aren't you?
Well, we're gonna get you out there soon enough.
First we have to tag you. I need to get some more from the other building.
It's so good to see you, little man, isn't it Fluffy?
Back in a jiffy.
Fluffy, hurry!
All right, stand clear,
I will get ze door open!
Oy, oy, oy, stop that.
Come on, outside, Fluffy, come on, outside and play.
Leave the animals be.
Sorry, mon ami.
OK, here we go.
You find yourself a mate, little man.
And stay away from the cold water, OK?
Bye-bye.
'For a sea turtle, the odds of surviving in the ocean are pretty slim.
'Shelly and I made it through some tough situations,
'with, at times, a little help from the humans.
'But somehow, no matter how hard we tried,
'fate was determined to keep us apart.”
- You have to help us!
- What's wrong?
He's trapped! He's gonna fall over!
- Who?
- Hurry! Follow us!
We found someone to help you!
Good, cos this thing's about to go!
Hold up, hold up, is that all you could find?
You might as well have brought me a shrimp.
He's too small!
What's he gonna do?
How's he gonna help me?
Stop moving! You'll send yourself over the edge, and you're done for!
Wait a second.
You sound familiar.
Come here.
Come on, come closer.
Let me get a better look at you.
Well, twist my shell cos I can't believe this! Sammy?
Sammy, is that you?
Ray?
I thought you were...
Go ahead, go on say it- turtle soup, huh?
[Laughs]
How did you ever get away?
Ah, it takes a lot more to stop old Ray here. You know that.
It took me two days.
This kid, a first-timer on the boat, found me, tossed me in a bait bucket.
- Hoo.
- Good thing, too, cos I was starving!
After I ate all the bait,
I jumped overboard.
By then we were miles away from each other.
I blamed myself for us getting separated.
No, Ray, you...
Whoa!
He's gonna fall over if you don't get him out of there!
I can do this.
How did you end up in this thing anyway?
OK, let me tell you about it, right?
It was full of frozen squid when I found it!
It was gonna be an easy in and out, but it slipped and I got trapped, so I just started eating them one by one, cos they thawed out real slow.
But as I was eating, I started getting full, then I started moving slow, then I couldn't move and you know me
I got the trots.
OK, OK, no more talking, it's time to get you outta there!
[Grunts]
No, no, no!
Easy, Sammy.
Don't move, Ray, stay still.
No! Ray!
Sammy, can you get me out of here?
Get me out of here!
-Ahh!
-Oh!
Ahh!
[Grunts]
Whoo! I knew you had my shell all the time, my friend. Whoo!
Ladies, my heartfelt gratitude goes out to you.
Your bravery is only exceeded by your collective beauty.
[Both giggle]
Good line, Ray.
Isn't it? Aside from the obvious reason, it's really good to see you, Sammy.
It's been a long time.
So what are you doing out here all alone?
It's a long story.
- Now where have I heard that before?
- I need your help, Ray.
Hey, we're practically brothers.
What do you need?
I have to find someone.
Someone very special to me.
The trick is to know where to look.
And this time of year, there's only one place she would be headed.
That would be the magical place.
Look at this. It shines like this all day.
You never want to leave.
This is amazing!
If you're looking for a mate, this is where you wanna be.
There's Rita! Hey, Honeybee!
- Rita, I'm back!
- Huh? What?
[Gasps] Ray!
What took you so long?
Oh, shnookums, I was... entangled, so to speak, OK?
And then I swam into my very old friend.
Honey, sugar pie, this is Sammy.
[Gasps] Sammy? For real?
The one and only.
Hi, Rita.
Very pleased to meet you.
I thought you was dead?
I mean, Ray always thought...
I know, turtle soup.
I'm glad you finally tamed his wandering ways.
[Both] He's cute.
Hey, hey, hey, relax, girls, he's got a mate already.
Well, where is she?
I'd love to meet her.
- I wish I knew.
- That's why we're here.
See, we need to find her.
They were separated quite a while ago.
Oh, you poor dear.
They've been looking for each other ever since.
[Both] Oh, how romantic.
She's got a shark bite on her shell.
- Anybody seen her?
- I believe I did. What's her name?
- Shelly.
- Yes, that's her!
Where did you see her?
Where did she go?
I'm pretty sure she went in there.
What are you waiting for, buddy?
Let's go find her.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Oh, but sugar bee...
You stay right here.
Sammy needs me.
You brought him here, now it's up to him.
Oh, OK then.
I'll be right here if you want me.
[Both] You'll find her, Sammy.
Love always finds a way.
Yeah.
# Always finds a way #
# I know you're somewhere out there #
# - Somewhere far away
- Shelly? #
# - I want you back
- Shelly? #
# I want you back #
# - My neighbours think I'm crazy
- Shelly? #
# But they don't understand #
# You're all I have #
# At night when the stars light up my room #
# I sit by myself #
# Talking to the moon #
# Trying to get to you #
# In hopes you're on the other side #
# Talking to me too #
# Or am I a fool #
# Who sits alone #
# Talking to the moon? #
# Oh-oh-oh #
# I'm feeling like I'm famous #
# The talk of the town #
# They say I've gone mad #
# Yeah, I've gone mad #
# But they don't know what I know #
# Cos when the sun goes down...? #
Shelly? Shelly?
Oh!
[Grunts]
Shelly?
Oh!
What's wrong?
You didn't find her?
She's here all right.
She's got a mate.
Are you sure?
I'm positive.
I saw them together behind the boat.
Oh, no.
I'm really sorry, Sammy.
What are you gonna do now?
I know, I know you're probably not thinking this way, but there are lots of other turtles out there.
Stop it, Ray.
That's not what he wants to hear right now.
Hey, Ray, you's back, how's it going?
- Could be better.
- Ooh, hi, Rita.
Robbie,
Clara's been looking for you.
Well, that figures. With all the good-looking gals out here, she does not want me to be wandering around too much.
- [Both giggle]
- Well, I better get going.
And later.
You too, manana banana, you know what I'm talkin' about.
- Who's Clara?
- Robbie's mate.
I thought... Shelly and...
Robbie were...
Mates?
[Laughs hysterically]
Yes, that's the way it looked to me.
Robbie?
Oh, oh, he'll flirt with any gal that says hello, and that's why Clara keeps him on a tight leash.
That... would be Robbie.
I should do the same with you.
Me on a leash?
Oh, sugar, you know you're my baby bee.
So that means...
Shelly may not have a mate after all.
You might be right.
What do I do?
I wouldn't be waiting around here.
But what if she doesn't...
Doesn't what?
Duh!
Want him as her mate.
Oh, yeah,
OK, hold on, hold on.
I got it! I got an idea.
All right, listen to me, this is what you're gonna have to do,
You're gonna need to make a big entrance, Sammy.
Is Albert still hanging around?
He is.
What crazy idea are you trying to pull off this time?
Trust me, eh!
Ohh!
[Screams]
Help!
Oh!
Oh, thank you.
You were so brave.
I suppose I was finally in the right place at the right time.
Sammy?
How did you find me?
Look out! Behind you!
It's OK... he's a friend.
What?
What, what's going on?
I knew this was a bad idea
Oh, I see.
After what happened at the secret passage, I wasn't sure if...
If what?
If you and I were meant to be.
Come here, silly.
? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do
J Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-bi-do!
Yeah!
I - Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do
- [Both] Whoo!
? Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
? I was born, by a mother at the school of understanding
? And raised, by a sister, who taught me I could be standing
? At the age of seven,
I fell in love with Blackie
? And nothing could come in my way
? When women go smiling
? I start running
? When women go talking
? I start blushing
? When women start asking
? - Why I keep on falling
- Keep on falling
? I can't stop running away
? They call me little love child with a thorn in my side
? You shouldn't be talking to me
? They call me little love child with a thorn in my side
? You shouldn't be talking to me
? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do
? Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
? I soon turned eleven
I was lost and separated
? It was head over heels that got me stimulated
? Like John McEnroe, my sky kept on falling
? I knew I had something to say... ?
Look, I'm getting all blubbery and soft-shelled.
Oh, you poor dear.
Next thing you know I'm gonna put a little pink pom-pom on my tail.
Oh, I'm so sensitive.
? Asking, asking, we're falling, we're falling... ?
'The day I was born, the odds were
I wasn't going to make it,
'and I didn't have a clue as to what I was supposed to do.
'Ray showed me how to have fun and the meaning of true friendship,
'and then I met Shelly.
'She made me complete, gave my life meaning,
'and that, by any measure, is pretty great.
'As for humans,
'I must admit, we're going to need their help more and more,
'to protect us and keep our oceans alive and beautiful.'
Looks like the little ones made it out pretty good this time.
Well, looks that way.
So, where did we say we're supposed to meet the women again?
Tristan da Cunha.
Tristan da what?
It's in the middle of nowhere.
- Any humans?
- What can I say?
You know they're everywhere!
Hello?
- I've got this one.
- Go for it.
Hello, hello, is anybody up there?
Hi, there.
Uh, hi, I can't get out.
Could you help me?
I know exactly how you feel.
Let me give you a little nudge to get you started.
The first steps are always the hardest.
What exactly am I supposed to do?
Just put one flipper in front of the other and you'll be all right.
# OO oo oo #
# OO oo oo #
# Sometimes I get my head in a dilly #
# Feeling so lost, ticking you off #
# Now, boy, you know me well #
# Said, I'm that kinda filly #
# That kind of soft, that kind of silly #
# But when I'm in doubt,
I open my mouth #
# And words come out, words come out like #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water, water #
# There's something underneath my bed #
# Oh, please believe I said #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water, water #
# I caught them barking at the moon #
# Better be soon #
# High in the sky, the song that I'm singing #
# A sweet little lie, I cry wolf, cry #
# Rabbit out the hat #
# Yes, that's what I'm bringing #
# Got some tricks up my sleeve #
# For noticing me #
# Oh, yeah #
# I wouldn't cause you any harm,#
# I just want you in my arms #
# I can't help, I can't help myself #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water #
# There's something underneath my bed #
# Oh, please believe I said #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water, water #
# I caught them barking at the moon #
# Better be soon #
# Better be soon #
# Right is right
Rules are rules #
# This is more like April fool #
# I'm just winding you up I #
Money, money, money. Hey!
You got a date with justice, one-Eyed Bart.
Too bad, Sheriff. I 'm a married man.
One-Eyed Betty!
I think you dropped something, mister.
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!
You've reached the end of the line!
I always wanted to go out with a bang!
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!
Hold him steady!
Woody, hurry!
No!
Glad I could catch the train!
Now let's catch some criminals.
To infinity and beyond!
Reach for the sky.
You can't touch me, Sheriff!
I brought my attack dog with a built-in force field.
Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs.
Evil Dr. Pork Chop!
That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork Chop to you.
"Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."
"Woody, no. It'll kill you." "Just do it!"
"You're going to jail, Bart."
"Watch out!"
Mom!
No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I 'm not here.
Oh, no, Molly!
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?
Come on.
Say "Happy birthday" to Molly.
- Happy birthday!
- Charming.
Happy birthday!
- Look how tall you're getting.
- Yeah!
"I came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"
"Got it, Woody."
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
"Good work, Buzz."
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.
Wait! I can't find my other eye.
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?
Yes. No. I mean, why would I mind squeezing next to you?
Is it hot in here?
Here they come!
Sarge, you got it?
Mission accomplished.
Hooray!
Careful. Careful!
All right, guys. We got one shot at this. Everyone ready?
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.
Target is on approach.
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.
Hello?
Hello? Anyone there?
Molly, stay out of my room!
I wasn't in your room.
Then who was messing with my stuff?
It wasn't me.
Well, that went well.
He held me! He actually held me!
This is just sad.
Who we kiddin'?
The kid 's 17 years old.
We ain't ever gettin' played with.
Guys, hey, hold up.
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!
Not again!
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.
We are gathered, Woody.
Okay. First off, we all knew operation Playtime was a long shot.
More like a misfire.
But we've always said this job isn't about getting played with. It's about...
Being there for Andy. We know.
But we can try again! Right?
I 'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.
What?
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.
We're going into attic mode, folks.
Keep your accessories with you at all times.
Spare parts, batteries, anything you need for an orderly transition.
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.
Yeah, but now it's here.
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.
- Moving on?
- You're going AWoL?
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.
And let's face it, when the trash bags come out, we army guys are the first to go.
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck, folks.
You're gonna need it.
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.
How do you know?
- We're being abandoned!
- We'll be fine, Jessie.
- So why did Sarge leave?
- Should we leave?
- I thought we were goin' to the attic.
- I hate all this uncertainty!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.
I mean, yeah, we've lost friends along the way.
- Wheezy and Etch and...
- Bo Peep?
Yeah. Even Bo.
All good toys who've gone on to new owners.
But through every yard sale, every spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!
He must care about us, or we wouldn't be here.
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in the attic. It'll be safe and warm...
- And we'll all be together.
- Exactly!
There's games up there, and books, and...
- The racecar track!
- The racecar track. Thank you!
- And the old TV.
- There you go, the old TV.
And those guys from the Christmas decorations box. They're fun, right?
Yeah.
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.
And he'll play with us then, right?
We'll always be there for him.
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready, and go out on a high note.
I 'd better find my other eye.
Where'd you leave it this time?
Someplace dark. And dusty.
Come on. Let's see how much we're going for on eBay.
Don't worry. Andy's gonna take care of us. I guarantee it!
You guarantee it, huh?
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?
Well, whatever happens, at least we'll all be together.
For infinity and beyond.
- Can I have your stereo?
- No.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I 'm taking it with me.
- Can I have your computer?
- No.
- Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.
Anything you're not taking to college either goes in the attic, or it's trash.
- Mom, I 'm not leaving till Friday.
- Come on. It's garbage day.
- Mom.
- Look, it's simple.
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.
Why do you still have these toys?
Molly, out of my room!
Three more days and it's mine!
Molly, you're not off the hook either.
You have more toys than you know what to do with.
Some of them could make other kids really happy.
What kids?
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.
What's daycare?
- Mom.
- No buts.
You choose the toys you want to donate, I 'll drop them off at Sunnyside.
Poor Barbie.
I get the Corvette.
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.
Like what?
Like what are you gonna do with these toys?
Should we donate them to Sunnyside?
- No.
- Maybe sell them online?
Mom, no one's gonna want those old toys.
They're junk.
Fine. You have till Friday.
Anything that's not packed for college or in the attic
- is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.
- What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot.
That's what's happening.
- You need a hand?
- I got it.
Here.
So, you gonna miss me when I 'm gone?
- Lf I say no, do I still get your room?
- Nope.
Then, yes, I 'll miss you.
I can't breathe!
- This can't be happening!
- Quiet! What's that sound?
Andy!
That's not trash. That's not trash!
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!
Okay, boy. To the curb!
No, Buster! No!
Get up. Buster!
- We're on the curb!
- I knew it would come to this!
Pull, everyone! Pull!
- It won't rip!
- Forget it!
It's triple-ply, high-density polyethylene!
There's gotta be a way out!
Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?
Point. Point. Point!
Push! Push!
I can hear the garbage truck!
It's getting closer.
Buzz! Jessie!
- Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.
- Junk. He called us junk.
- How could he?
This doesn't make any sense.
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.
- Sarge was right.
- Yeah, and Woody was wrong.
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.
- Should we be hysterical?
- No!
- Yes!
- Maybe! But not right now!
Fellas, I know what to do.
What the heck?
- We should 've done this years ago.
- Jessie, wait. What about Woody?
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.
Now we need to go!
You're right. Come on.
- Buzz?
- Woody!
What's going on? Don't you know this box is being donated?
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.
We're going to daycare!
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.
Attic? So how did we end up on the curb?
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.
And called us junk!
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.
Sure thing, college boy!
Andy's moving on, Woody.
It's time we did the same.
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.
Woody, wait. We need to figure out what's best for everyone.
Great. Great! It's gonna take us forever to get back here.
It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.
Well, Molly and I have been growing apart for years.
It's just... I can't believe she would throw me away!
- Welcome to the club, toots.
- Okay, everyone, listen up.
We can get back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast.
We'll hide under the seats till we get back home.
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.
Andy doesn't want us anymore.
He was putting you in the attic!
He left us on the curb!
- All right, calm down! Both of you!
- Okay, fine. Fine.
Just wait till you see what daycare's like.
- Why? What's it like?
- Daycare is a sad, lonely place for washed-up old toys who have no owners.
- Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
- You'll see.
As soon as we get to daycare, you'll be begging to go home.
Can anyone see anything?
- There's a playground!
- Wow!
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!
So much for sad and lonely, huh?
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.
Perspective? This place is perfect.
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.
- Hey there!
- Wow!
Haven't seen you in ages.
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.
- Say hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
Hey, how are your kids?
Molly and Andy?
Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.
- What?
- Can you believe it?
- You sure they won't miss these?
- No, they never get played with.
- You see any kids?
- Where is she taking us?
- Look!
- Wow!
What? What is it?
No, no, no.
What's the matter with you?
I can't see!
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!
- So now what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.
- Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.
Careful. These toys might be jealous of new arrivals.
- I want to see!
- Hey!
- Rex!
- It's my turn!
New toys!
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.
Buzz Lightyear at your service.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Thank you. May I?
The claw!
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I 'm Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear.
But please call me Lotso.
Buzz Lightyear. We come in...
First thing you gotta know about me,
I 'm a hugger.
Look at you all. You've been through a lot today, haven't ya?
It's been horrible.
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.
We been dumped, donated, yard-saled, secondhanded and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait, you'll find being donated was the best thing that ever happened to ya.
Mr. Lotso, do toys here get played with every day?
All day long. Five days a week.
But what happens when the kids grow up?
Well, now, I 'll tell ya.
When the kids get old, new ones come in.
When they get old, new ones replace them.
You'll never be outgrown or neglected, never abandoned or forgotten.
No owners means no heartbreak.
- It's a miracle.
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.
Because we're Andy's toys!
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
- Now, let's get you all settled in.
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?
Let's show our new friends where they'll be staying.
Folks, if you want to step right this way...
Hi, I 'm Ken.
Barbie. Have we ever met?
I would 've remembered.
- Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.
- What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.
Folks, if I can share, here at Sunnyside, we've got, well, just about anything a toy could ask for.
Spare parts, superglue, and enough fresh batteries to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.
- Think you're gettin' old?
- Wow.
Well, stop your worryin'.
Our repair spa will keep you stuffed, puffed, and lightly buffed.
And this, well, this is where I live.
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.
And a whole room just for trying on clothes.
You have everything!
Everything except someone to share it with.
You need anything at all, you just come talk to me. Here we are.
Well, thank you, Big Baby.
Why don't you come meet our new friends?
Poor baby. We were thrown out together, me and him.
Abandoned by the same owner.
But we don't need owners at Sunnyside.
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.
We control our own destiny.
Watch out for puddles.
And here's where you folks'll be stayin'.
The Caterpillar Room.
- Look at this place.
- Wow!
Holy moly guacamole.
Jackpot, baby.
- Whoa, puppy!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
It's so beautiful!
What the... Hey, little guy.
How long 's it been since you all got played with?
It's been years.
Well, just you wait. In a few minutes, that bell's gonna ring, and you'll get the playtime that you've been dreamin' of.
Play! Real play! I can't wait!
Now, if you'll excuse us, we best be headin' back.
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
- Thank you.
- Take care, pinky.
- Goodbye, Mr. Lotso. Thank you.
- Thank you, buddy boy.
- Will I see you again?
- I 'll see you tonight in my dreams.
Ken, let's get a move on.
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Heck, you don't know me from G.I. Joe, but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...
- Made for each other.
...made for each other.
- Yay!
- Yes.
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso.
This is so exciting!
Sounds like kids to me.
I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?
How many you reckon are out there?
They sound so sweet.
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.
But we need to go home.
We can have a whole new life here, Woody.
A chance to make kids happy again.
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.
- Come on, Woodster!
- You'll get played with.
- I can't. No.
- Stay here.
- You can make a new kid happy.
- No, no. Guys, really. No!
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!
And if he wants us at college, or in the attic, well, then, our job is to be there for him.
Now, I 'm going home.
Anyone who wants to join me is welcome. Come on, Buzz.
Buzz?
Our mission with Andy is complete, Woody.
What?
And what's important now is we stay together.
We wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Andy!
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.
Whose name is written there?
Maybe Andy doesn't care about us anymore.
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.
You can't just turn your back on him now!
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!
Okay, fine. Perfect.
I can't believe how selfish you all are.
So this is it?
After all we've been through.
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.
Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"
Look,
I don't want you left alone in the attic, okay? Now, stay.
Bonnie?
I gotta go.
Bonnie, you in here?
Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.
What... What the heck?
Now, that's better.
- Bonnie!
- Bluebells, cockleshells...
There you are. Come on, honey.
It's time to go home.
No, no, no, no!
Reach for the sky!
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...
You're my favorite deputy.
- Bonnie!
- Coming!
Great.
It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.
He's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.
Toys are for playtime.
Speaking of playtime, they're lining up out there!
- How many?
- There must be dozens.
I can hardly wait!
Places, everyone!
At last! I 'm gonna get played with!
- Rex?
- Come to papa.
'Here's a snake in my boot.
I'd like to join your posse, boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song.
A sheriff!
Move over, Mr. Pricklepants.
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?
It's good for you. But don't drink too much, or you'll have to...
Be right back!
Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.
Can you tell me where I am?
The guy's just asking a question.
Well, excuse me.
I 'm trying to stay in character.
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.
Hello, I 'm Trixie.
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
I don't know where I am.
We're either in a café in Paris or a coffee shop in New Jersey.
I 'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor with life-changing news.
We do a lot of improv here. Just stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.
- No, no, no, no. I...
- Who wants lunch?
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!
"I know where to hide."
She'll never find us in here.
What's wrong?
She found us! We need a spaceship to get away from the witch!
- You're doing great!
- Are you classically-trained?
Look, I just need to know how to get out of here!
There is no way out.
Just kidding. Door's right over there.
Well, cowboy, you just jumped right in, didn't ya? I 'm Dolly.
- Woody.
- Woody?
Really? You're gonna stick with that?
'Cause now's your chance to change it, new room and all.
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.
- Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?
- Well, actually...
- 'Course he's not, pea brain.
- He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have... My hat!
- Told ya.
- I found a spaceship!
Showtime.
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.
Three, two, one, blastoff!
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.
I got a kink in my slink.
My tail! Where's my tail?
Someone need a hand?
- Where's my nose?
- Here it is.
- Here's your arm.
- Give me that. That's mine.
Honey, the mustache?
I don't recall playtime being quite that strenuous.
Andy never played with us like that.
We're just gonna have to make the best of it.
But these toddlers, they don't know how to play with us.
- They're too young!
- Yeah, they're sticky.
Well, we should be in the Butterfly Room.
- With the big kids!
- That's right.
- Yeah, you said it.
- We'll get this straightened out.
I 'll go talk to Lotso about moving us to the other room.
Blast. Try that one.
It's locked!
- Same here.
- Try the windows.
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.
Finest childproof lock in the world.
- We're trapped!
- Wait.
Did anyone notice the transom?
Oh, great. How do we get up there?
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...
- Three!
- Whoa!
Let go!
Go!
- He did it!
- Yes, sir!
Way to go, Buzz!
Yeah, you think they had a fun playtime?
They might hear you.
- Okay, now you start.
- I...
- Love...
- You.
See? That time, I said "love."
Okay, now me first.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I...
- Love...
- You.
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.
You are so smart.
Come on, Romeo. We're late.
- I 'll wait up for you.
- Kisses!
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.
- Come on. Any splits?
- Heya. Bring it here.
- All right.
- Here we go.
- Come on, horsey, come on!
- Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.
- Gobble, gobble, baby.
- Come on, horsey.
Come on, duck.
- All right, that's it. No more bets.
- Come on! Right here.
Let me have the duck, let me have the duck, let me have the duck!
Here is a duck.
- I won!
- Ah, man!
- Well, Stretch takes the round.
- You lost!
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.
- Coyote's wild.
- Here, here.
- Two greens here.
- Changing two double A's.
Hey, what do you guys think of the new recruits? Any keepers?
Oh, please! Landfill!
- Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.
But that space guy, he could be useful.
He ain't the sharpest knife in the place where they keep the knives.
Neither are you, Chunk.
You got a little keeper yourself, didn't you, Ken?
Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.
Aw, Mr. Softy over here.
What do you expect from a girl's toy?
I 'm not a girl's toy! I 'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?
All them toys are disposable.
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.
Well, well. Looky who we have here.
Let me go!
Take him to the libary.
No!
1225 Sycamore.
Woody, what are you doing?
I gotta get outta here.
- You're leaving?
- But didn't you have fun today?
Well, of course I did, more than I 've had in years, but, you see,
I belong to someone else.
- Who's "Yid-nuh"?
- I believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."
Guys, it says "Andy."
He's my Bonnie.
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.
- Where's home?
- Elm Street. 234 Elm.
- You guys have a map?
- We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?
I 'll fire up the computer.
Unhand me, you cowards!
I demand to talk to Lotso!
Zip it, Buck Rogers.
You don't talk to Lotso till we say you can...
Ken? What's goin' on here?
Why is this toy tied up?
He got out, Lotso.
"Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.
F-A-oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I 'm so sorry.
- Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?
The children in the Caterpillar Room are not age-appropriate for me and my friends.
We respectfully request a transfer to the Butterfly Room.
Well, request granted!
- But, Lotso...
- Hush now, Kenneth.
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.
Why, I 'd say we've found ourselves a keeper.
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!
We're calling you up to the big leagues, son.
From now on, you'll have anything you want.
Excellent. I 'll go get my friends.
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.
Those Caterpillar kids need someone to play with.
But my friends don't belong there.
None of us do, I agree.
Which is why, for the good of our community, we ask the newer toys, the stronger ones, to take on the hardships the rest of us can't bear anymore.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.
Family man, huh? I understand.
Put him back in the timeout chair.
What are ya... Unhand me!
Bring in the Bookworm.
Here it is.
It was filed under "Lightyear."
Let's see here.
"Accessories. Maintenance."
Here we go.
"Remove screws to access battery compartment."
What are you doing?
Stop!
Let go of me!
"To return your Buzz Lightyear action figure to its original factory settings..."
No!
"...slide the switch from
Play to Demo."
Stop! No! No! No!
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.
I 'll see what it was.
What do you see? Anything?
No, just a dark hallway and...
Wait. Wait!
I see Andy!
- What?
- That's impossible.
No, no, I really see him. In his room.
My other eye! The one I left behind.
'His is so weird. He's packing up.
Here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.
He's looking in the attic.
Wait, there's Mom.
Why is he so upset?
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!
He's looking for us?
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!
I think he did mean to put us in the attic.
Well, then,
Woody was telling the truth.
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him.
Hey, you didn't believe him first!
Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!
- Lotso!
- Hey, there.
How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?
Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?
There's been a mistake.
We have to go.
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.
We were runnin' low on volunteers for the little ones.
They just love new toys, now, don't they?
"Love"? We've been chewed, kicked, drooled on.
Just look at my pocketbook!
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin' Sunnyside.
"Sweet potato"!
Who do you think you're talking to?
I have over 30 accessories, and I deserve more respect...
That's better.
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth, except me.
Give it back, you furry air freshener!
Come on, guys. We're goin' home.
Whoa there, missy.
You're not goin' anywhere.
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?
Buzz! You're back!
Buzz?
Hey!
Look out!
What are you, nuts?
Buzz!
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence, minions of Zurg!
You're in the custody of the Galactic Alliance!
- "Zurg"?
- "Galactic Alliance"?
Oh, boy.
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!
Yes, sir!
Where do you think you're going?
Buzz! We're your friends!
Spare me your lies, temptress.
Your emperor's defeated, and I 'm immune to your bewitching good looks.
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!
Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus!
Not him.
I think this potato needs to learn himself some manners.
Take him to the box.
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?
Bad baby! Bad baby!
Ken? What's going on?
Barbie! I told you to wait in the Dream House.
What are you doing to my friends?
Get in there!
- Barbie, wait!
- Don't touch me.
- We're through!
- Barbie! I did...
And give me my scarf back!
Lightyear! Explain our overnight accommodations.
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.
Any prisoner caught outside their cell spends the night in the box.
Roll call at dusk and dawn.
Any prisoner misses roll call, spends the night in the box.
Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to.
Any prisoner talks back, spends the night...
In the box! We get it.
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.
But remember, they'll say anything to make you doubt yourself.
Don't worry, Commander.
Any doubt I had got pounded out of me at the academy.
Listen up, folks.
We got a way of doin' things here at Sunnyside.
If you start at the bottom, pay your dues, life here can be a dream come true!
But if you break our rules, step outta line, try to check out early, well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.
Woody! What did you do to him?
You all get a good night's rest.
You got a full day of playtime tomorrow.
1225 Syca...
Who's Velocistar237?
That's just a dinosaur toy down the street.
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.
- Just a dinosaur.
- All right.
Sycamore. Okay, enter!
Please don't be far. Please, please!
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!
I 'm going to college! Look at me!
I 'm big toy on campus! Hello!
- Hey, I 'll see you at the sock hop.
- Okay, Potsie.
Hey, listen. If any of you guys ever get to Sunnyside Daycare, you tell 'em Woody made it home.
- You came from Sunnyside?
- But how'd you escape?
Well, it wasn't easy.
What do you mean "escape"?
Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair.
Ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries.
Lotso?
The guy may seem plush and huggable on the outside, but inside, he's a monster.
But... How do you know that?
Chuckles. He'll tell you.
Yeah, I knew Lotso.
He was a good toy. A friend.
Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy.
A was there when Lotso got unwrapped.
Daisy loved us all.
But Lotso,
Lotso was special.
'Hey did everything together.
You've never seen a kid and a toy more in love.
One day, we took a drive.
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.
She never came back.
Lotso wouldn't give up.
It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's.
But by then, it was too late.
Something changed that day inside Lotso.
Something snapped.
She replaced us. Come on!
- No, she only replaced you!
- She replaced all of us.
Didn't she?
She don't love you no more!
Now come on!
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.
'Hen we found Sunnyside.
But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.
He wasn't anyone's friend.
He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system.
So how'd you get out?
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys, they don't stand a chance.
- But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.
Returning now would be suicide!
But what about your Andy?
Isn't he leaving for college?
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.
But he ain't ever comin' back.
Rise and shine, campers!
Commander Lotso, sir!
All quiet, nothing to report.
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.
Wait! What've you done with my husband?
Big Baby.
Sweetheart!
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs.
I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!
Hello?
You shouldn't have come back, cowboy.
'Hey've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols.
You and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now.
I made it out once.
You got lucky once. Want my advice?
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.
Yeah, for how long?
I've been here years.
'Hey'll never break me.
'Here's only one way toys leave this place.
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.
Then it's off to the dump.
Look, I appreciate your concern, old-timer.
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I 'd sure be grateful.
Well, if you're gonna get out, first thing you gotta get through's the doors.
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.
Got it. What else?
Lotso has trucks patrolling all night long.
Hallway, lobby, playground.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?
Eight-feet high. Cinder block.
No way through it.
You go over or under.
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.
It's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.
The monkey's the eye in the sky.
He sees everything.
Classrooms.
Hallways.
Even the playground.
You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere.
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!
Recess! Come on, kids!
Hey, guys.
- Woody?
- Woody!
Woody!
- Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
- Thank goodness!
- You're alive!
- 'Course I 'm alive!
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?
Lotso did something to him!
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Return of the astro-nut.
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I was wrong.
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.
No, no, it's my fault for leaving you guys.
From now on, we stick together.
But Andy's leavin' for college.
College? Hog-tie the mailman!
We gotta get you home before Andy leaves tomorrow!
Tomorrow? But that means...
It means we're busting out of here, tonight.
- What? Impossible!
- But there's no way out of here!
No, there is one way out.
One way.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
- Springy dog.
- Present.
Green guys.
- Cowgirl.
- Here.
Horse.
- Piggy bank.
- Y o.
- Tyrannosaurus.
- Here.
- Barbie.
- Here.
Potato Head.
Potato Head?
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!
Impossible!
Hey!
Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, smoothie.
Well, well, well. You're turning out to be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?
What did you think you were gonna do? Waltz right out of here?
Yeah, and I would 've got away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling toys!
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!
You're a purse with legs.
Take him back to the box.
No! No, not the box! I 'm sorry.
I didn't mean it! I like ascots.
Really. No, no, no!
Okay, check.
Good work, Lightyear. All right, resume your space-guy-thingy.
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!
Ken! Ken?
What do you want?
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go to the Butterfly Room. With you!
Yeah, well, you should 've thought of that yesterday.
I was wrong.
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.
Please take me away from this!
Take me away!
Darn it, Barbie!
Okay, but things are complicated around here.
- You gotta do what I say.
- I will, Ken! I promise!
Wait. I 'll do anything!
I 'll change your diapers!
Go get the tape!
And this is where the magic happens.
Look at all your clothes!
I can't believe you never brought me up here!
- Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
- I know, I know, I know.
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.
Campus hero with matching sports pennant, huh?
Flower power! Oh, Ken!
No one appreciates clothes here, Barbie. No one.
Ken, would you model a few outfits for me?
Just a few?
Go get the key.
Where is it, where is it?
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
I told you, keep your hands off of my stuff!
Make a move, porky!
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!
- Hey! Hey!
- Take that, walnut-brain.
No wonder you're extinct.
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!
Help! Prison riot!
Get the tortilla.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Barbie?
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?
And how do we switch him back?
You can't make me talk. You can't!
But I 'd like to see you try.
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.
Barbie! Those were vintage!
It's okay. All right, go ahead, rip 'em, I don't care.
They're a dime a dozen.
Glitter tux.
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?
A Nehru jacket.
Barbie! Not the Nehru.
This is from what, 1967?
The groovy formal collection, yes!
- What a shame.
- Oh, no, no, no! No!
There's an instruction manual!
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!
Where's that manual?
I don't know why this couldn't wait until morning, Ken, but here you go.
What's takin' so doggone long?
So how do we fix Buzz?
What are you looking at, feathers?
Hey!
Yeah, fly away, you coward.
Well, that's just great.
Help! Prison riot!
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Give it up. No one can hear you.
- What?
- I said, "No one can hear you."
- What?
- He said, "No one can..."
Shush! Will you be quiet?
Woody! You're back!
Stop him! Don't let him get out!
Star Command! I 've been taken hostage by my own prisoners.
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!
Unhand me, Zurg scum!
The Galactic Courts will show you no mercy.
It's not working. Why is it not working? Where's the manual?
Here we go! There should be a little hole under the switch.
- Little hole, got it!
- "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,
- "insert paperclip..."
- Rex, use your finger!
What?
- Okay, now what?
- All right, let's see.
"Caution. Do not hold button for more than five seconds."
It's not my fault!
- Now what did you do?
- I just did what you told me!
Amigos! We're all amigos.
We gotta switch him back.
- Well, how do we do that?
- I don't know. That part's in Spanish.
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El Buzzo.
Good luck, cowboy.
Here they come.
Come on, Buzz!
What took you so long?
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?
We haven't seen him.
Buzz.
Did you fix Buzz?
- Sort of.
- Behind you.
Someone's coming.
You would not believe what I 've been through tonight.
Darling! Are you okay?
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.
You've lost weight. And so tall.
You're a sight for detachable eyes.
All clear.
Come on. Come on.
We're almost there.
Back up. Back up!
Come on.
Woody!
Come on. We're almost there.
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.
Way to go, Buzz. Come on.
- Is it safe?
- I guess I 'll find out.
- Woody? You okay?
- Yeah.
Come on down. But not all at once.
- What did he say?
- I think he said, "All at once."
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!
- Geronimo!
- Look out!
Thanks, Jess.
Almost there, guys.
Slink, you think you can make it?
Well, I might be old, but I still got a spring in my step.
- He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins.
Okay, climb across.
You lost, little doggie?
Well, well. Look who's back.
I'm sorry, cowboy.
They broke me.
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?
He don't want you no more.
- That's a lie.
- Is it?
Tell me this, Sheriff.
If your kid loves you so much, why is he leaving?
You think you're special, cowboy?
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.
Speak of the devil.
Now, we need toys in our Caterpillar Room and you need to avoid that truck.
Why don't you come on back, join our family again?
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!
And I 'd rather rot in this dumpster than join any family of yours!
Jessie's right! Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force.
If that's what you want.
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.
Not to me, there's not.
Fine. Then why don't you join her!
Oh, Ken!
Everyone, listen!
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair.
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid, and he put himself on top!
Anyone concur with Ken?
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're at the dump.
Wait! What about Daisy?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Daisy? You used to do everything with her?
- Yeah? Then she threw us out.
- No.
- She lost you.
- She replaced us!
She replaced you.
And if you couldn't have her then no one could.
You lied to Big Baby and you've been lying ever since.
- Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.
She never loved me.
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.
Mama.
What? You want your mommy back?
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!
Push 'em in. All of 'em!
This is what happens when you dummies try to think.
We're all just trash, waiting to be thrown away! That's all a toy is!
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!
- He's gone!
- Holy cow.
Come on. Hurry!
For crying out loud!
Woody!
Oh, boy. Incoming!
Come on!
Barbie, no!
Woody!
No!
Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?
Of course not, you imbecile.
We're doomed!
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.
We all here? Slinky? Rex?
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!
Buzz!
They'll never make it!
Look out!
Buzz!
- Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.
Buzz, you okay?
Buzz! Buzz!
That wasn't me, was it?
Buzz, you're back! You're back, you're back, you're back, you're back!
Yes, I 'm back. Where have I been?
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.
Woody! So where are we now?
In a garbage truck on the way to the dump!
Hold on, we're going in!
You got all your pieces?
The claw!
- My babies!
- Hey, guys! No! No!
No!
Hang on!
Woody! What do we do?
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...
- Woody!
- Slinky!
It's a magnet! Watch out!
Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down.
You might wanna take a look at this.
Quick! Grab something metal!
You heard the guy.
It's not working!
Help! Help me. I 'm stuck!
Help, please! Help!
Woody!
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.
Woody!
Go, go!
Thank you, Sheriff.
We're all in this together.
Right, guys?
Guys?
Woody! Down here!
- Woody!
- Oh, boy.
Woody, look. I can see daylight.
We're gonna be okay!
Hey!
I don't think that's daylight.
Run!
Sheriff! The button! Help me!
Come on!
Go. Go! Hit the button!
Hurry!
- Just push it! Push it!
- Push it!
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?
No. No!
Lotso!
No!
Rex!
Buzz! What do we do?
The claw.
You know all that bad stuff I said about Andy's attic?
I take it all back.
- You're darn tootin'.
- You said it.
Oh, darling. You were so brave.
- You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.
My boys!
Daddy!
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?
Yeah. I 'd like to loosen his stitchin'.
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.
- Hey!
- What you got?
I had me one of these when I was a kid.
Strawberries.
Hey, buddy. You might wanna keep your mouth shut.
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.
- That's right, college boy.
- Wait.
What about you guys? I mean, maybe the attic's not such a great idea.
- We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him, together.
- I just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute!
Wait, I 'll check!
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done!
- He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time!
- Come on, Buster.
- Is that it, honey? You got everything?
Yeah. Just a few more boxes in my room.
Okay. Come on.
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!
All right. Go. Go, go!
Okay. All clear.
There you are.
- There you go.
- Buzz.
- This isn't goodbye.
- Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.
Yeah, but not too much fun.
- Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.
Sure thing.
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?
'Course I will. Besides, I know about
- Buzz's Spanish mode.
- My what?
Honey, you want some food for the road?
I 'll get something on the way.
You know where to find us, cowboy.
Did you say goodbye to Molly?
Mom, we've said goodbye like 10 times.
Andy.
Mom, it's okay.
I know. It's just...
I wish I could always be with you.
You will be, Mom.
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye to Buster?
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?
Who's a good doggy? I 'm gonna miss you. I 'm gonna miss you.
- I 'm gonna miss you.
- Don't, Andy.
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.
Come on. Get the rest of your things.
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.
Hey.
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
I should donate these?
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.
"Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"
"Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts."
"Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!"
Mom.
- Andy?
- Hi.
Wow. Look at you.
Well, I hear you're off to college.
Yeah. Right now, actually.
So, what can we do for you?
I have some toys here.
You hear that, Bonnie?
So, you're Bonnie?
I 'm Andy.
Someone told me you're really good with toys.
These are mine, but I 'm going away now, so I need someone really special to play with them.
This is Jessie, the roughest, toughest cowgirl in the whole West.
She loves critters, but none more than her best pal, Bullseye.
Here.
This is Rex, the meanest, most terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!
The Potato Heads. Mr. And Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,
'cause they're madly in love.
Now Slinky here is as loyal as any dog you could want.
And Hamm, he'll keep your money safe, but he's also one of the most dastardly villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop.
These little dudes are from a strange alien world.
Pizza Planet.
And this is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!
He's sworn to protect the galaxy from the evil Emperor Zurg.
To infinity and beyond!
Now, you gotta promise to take good care of these guys.
They mean a lot to me.
My cowboy!
Woody? What's he doing in there?
- "There's a snake in my boot."
- Wha?
There's a snake in my boot.
Now, Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember.
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.
And kind. And smart.
But the thing that makes Woody special is he'll never give up on you.
Ever.
He'll be there for you, no matter what.
You think you can take care of him for me?
Okay then.
Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop's attacking the haunted bakery!
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop 'em!
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
And we'll actually need the rocket.
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!
We need to get in the spaceship.
The volcano is gonna erupt.
Look! They're being attacked by a real dog!
You can eat my poisonous scones!
Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head are in trouble.
Get on, Woody.
It's my friend Woody.
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.
Thanks, guys.
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.
Come on. Let's get some lunch.
So long, partner.
Hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.
New toys!
Noses.
"So I guess you could say
Sunnyside is sunny once again!
"Hope to hear from you soon. We're all super excited about your new home.
"Hugs and kisses to everyone."
That Barbie has some nice handwriting.
Buzz, Barbie didn't write this.
- Grab the sword!
- I got it!
- Okay, go for the...
- Triple bonus!
- Watch out!
- We got the cloak of darkness!
- Run, run!
- My arms are never long enough!
I 'll do it! This is it! This is it!
- Yes!
- We did it!
High-five! Hold on.
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.
- Look at this!
- Golly bob howdy! That's me!
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, lookin' good.
Yeah, she really got your smile.
What the...
I told you kids! Stay out of my butt!
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
Romeo, o Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Next season, we're doing Cats.
Or might I suggest Hamlet?
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.
I don't know what came over me.
Just go with it, Buzz.
Huh?
Th-that can't be!
Seriously?
Oops!
Huh?
Wow!
Yahoo!
This is amazing! Just like a dream!
Yahoo!
Help me!
Mom!
A train is coming to get me!
Mom! Mom!
So it was a dream.
Nemo, are you all right?
Was he having a bad dream again?
Don't tell me you sneaked a piece of pie again?
All right! lt's the circus parade! lcarus! Come here, lcarus!
Let's go!
We need to hurry or we'll miss it!
Excuse me! Oops. . .
Excuse me.
Awesome, look at that!
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! The amazing circus has come to town!
The greatest show on Earth!
Ooopsie.
Yahoo!
Hello there, son.
Me?
Want a ride?
Of course! Thanks!
Well then, are you enjoying yourself? lt's perfect! Right, lcarus?
Ladies and gentlemen in the crowd,
Children too,
Buy your tickets to the greatest show on Earth as soon as you can!
You sure are an amusing little fellow.
Dad! Dad!
The circus is in town!
That's nice. . .
Please, take me there!
Please, Dad?
Let's go tomorrow, Nemo.
You always say "tomorrow".
Oh drat! l'm late for my meeting. l must leave.
Tomorrow, l promise. Tomorrow.
Have a nice day, darling.
Drat. . .
Good night.
Good night, darling.
"Remember your promise"
Nemo!
Where am l?
Listen, Nemo, how many times must l tell you?
What was l doing?
Nemo! Come back at once!
Nemo!
Darling, please have a talk with your son.
He won't listen to me one bit.
Tomorrow. . . l'll talk to him tomorrow. . .
That was a close call. lcarus. Wake up. lcarus!
Look sharp, boys!
The King is coming through!
Attention!
Aye!
Good evening.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Who are you? l am a professor and a genius.
You may call me Professor Genius.
And this is BonBon. l am his assistant!
What do you want with me?
We came here to see you on orders from
Morpheus, the King of Slumberland.
King Morpheus?
Slumberland? lndeed.
Ah, the gift from the Princess.
Wait until the explanations are through.
His Majesty, King Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, and keeper of all good dreams.
Cordially invites little Nemo on behalf of his daughter, Princess Camille,
To be the royal playmate of Camille in Slumberland
Oh. . . thanks.
Princess Camille grows impatient, we must depart immediately.
W-wait a minute!
This princess is a girl, right? But l've never played with a girl before.
What?
She's not just a girl, she's a princess!
Same thing.
A girl is a girl.
And besides, l've never heard of Slumberland. lndifference over a royal invitation? Unheard of!
Then what about this present?
Present, you say?
Yes! lt is a present from the sweet Princess Camille!
Ooooh, l love presents!
These are delicious dream-sweets made in our special candy factory.
Woah, awesome!
Thanks! l like princesses after all. l like girls, too.
Yummy!
The King wishes you to ride on his private blimp.
A blimp? A real blimp?
Woah, look at that, lcarus! lt's real! And it looks just like my model!
Hi!
His Majesty has ordered your presence and is waiting for you. l'll come! l accept his invitation!
Right, lcarus? l'd better leave Mom a note.
Please hurry. We cannot delay the departure time.
Hurry, the princess is waiting.
Make haste, make haste, Nemo!
Okay!
Farewell, world. Preparations for ascent complete. lcarus, look! Those houses look like models!
This is amazing. We're getting higher and higher.
Well then, this place is. . .
The pilothouse! l know that.
Keep the present altitude and proceed at full speed!
Want to take the wheel, Nemo?
Can l?
Yes, you may. Grab 'hold tight.
Like this?
Yes, that's right.
Yes.
You're good, kid! Keep it up and you'll be an aeronaut someday.
Yahoo!
This feels like aero-acrobatics!
That's Nightmare! lt's Nightmare!
Oh no!
Emergency!
Grab it tight. Keep calm, Nemo.
Engines at full!
Don't worry. We've outrun Nightmare before.
Nightmare is gonna get us! lt's the Crystal Clouds!
Thank goodness. Once we enter those clouds, we will be safe.
Full speed ahead!
Hold on tight, Nemo.
A-are we safe now?
Yes, we are. All safe.
See? We're leaving through the clouds!
Lower the engines, prepare for descent.
Welcome to Slumberland!
So this is Slumberland?
They all know me?
Of course they do!
They all came here to welcome you!
Hello!
Hey, buddy, watch where you're going!
Move it!
Who's that?
Someone you should keep away from.
Hey, how's it goin', kid? Feelin' well?
Come play with me!
Leave that old geezer.
Old geezer, you say? lnsolent fool!
Well, see ya later!
Okay.
Hey, who was that, Professor? lt's Flip, the terrible.
Flip?
Please, son, don't speak that name in my presence again.
Little Nemo, to visit His Majesty!
Majesty,
As per your orders, l have brought this boy to you.
This is Nemo.
Your Majesty?
Ahh, of all the foolishness
Go search in the gardens! l'll search through the palace.
Hurry!
Make haste!
Yes, sir!
W-wait. . .
They're gone.
So you're the kid that was invited here?
What a lucky devil ya are.
You're Flip, aren't you.
Professor says you're "terrible."
S'ppose so. l'm terribly fun and terribly kind.
And l have the power to make your dreams come true.
So, ya wanna see the King, right?
Yes, l do.
Then let me handle that.
Do you really know where he is? l know everything, kid.
After all, l'm the only one here who has a correct map of the entire kingdom.
"Nightmare Land"?
Oh, Slumberland.
C'mon. Let's find the King.
Wait.
Don't worry. We'll probably find the King before the Professor does.
Hey, if that furball doesn't like it, leave 'em behind
No, he's okay. We're coming.
Wow!
Step this way.
Flip!
Everything's upside-down! lndeed it is.
Follow me.
Umph.
This takes a special technique. Watch closely.
Come. Show me what you've got.
Got'cha.
What's that?
Who could it be?
Something's loose. . . ls it this?
No, this one. . .
No, not that one either.
Then where is it wonky? lsn't it the piston gasket?
Ah, that it is. Wrench, please. . .
Wrench.
Screwdriver.
Piston gasket.
Put on the piston gasket and get it in tight. l think you should make it tighter for good measure.
Anything else?
Oil it up.
This is impressive! lt's all better.
You're a good little mechanic.
Guess so. l love trains.
So do l!
Hey, the train is leaving.
Oh, hurry to me!
Ouch.
Are we gonna follow it?
Of course. This way.
Follow me!
Hurry!
Where are we going?
Just hurry!
Oh, we made it just on time. lt's here!
All aboard!
You're the engineer.
Okay. Full speed!
Hey there, Moo-Moo, out of the way!
Train's coming through!
King Morpheus! King Morpheus!
What?
Move it, Professor! lt's been ages since l've had such fun.
Me too!
Ouch.
Your Majesty, l'd like to introduce you to-
We've already met.
"Your Majesty"?
You're the king??
Now, don't be so overly formal.
You can call me Morphy.
"Morphy"?
M-Morphy?
Oh, Morphy, this is my best friend, lcarus.
Well, what a cute little fellow you are.
Now then, Nemo, listen well. l invited you here so that you could become my heir.
Me?
Yes, you.
A prince always bears the mark of the heir. lt is this golden key.
This key has the ability to open any door in Slumberland.
Wow, thanks, Morphy!
However, l must warn you.
There is one door that you must not open. lt is the door that bears this symbol.
Solemnly swear to me, boy,
Promise that you will never open the door that bears this symbol.
Yes. l promise. l promise l won't open it.
Very well.
Now then, Professor, let's have my heir meet the Princess.
Yes, as you wish, your Majesty.
The Princess, eh?
The Rosebud Room. Princess Camellia's room.
The time has arrived.
Now then, let's get you looking your best.
Very good.
Sorry.
Come, Nemo. The Princess is waiting for you.
Listen, be on your best manners. Camellia is a Princess - don't ever forget that.
Princess, please pardon me.
May l please borrow your attention for just a moment?
This is Little Nemo.
"Little Nemo"?
Come.
Welcome.
So this boy is Nemo.
The present, Nemo.
You know, the cookies.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, er, l mean, for the cookies, Princess Camellia.
You're welcome. l'm glad you liked them.
Good work, Professor, you may leave.
Pardon me. l'll leave you two kids alone.
Professor! Don't leave me. . .
Have fun then.
See you later, Nemo.
Well!
Wh-what?
Nothing in particular. lt's just that you're the first.
The first person to enter a kingdom in his underthings.
Underthings? These aren't my underthings!
They're my pajamas!
Oh. But the royal invitation was supposed to apply exclusively to you.
We did not invite a rat.
A rat?
Yes. Your pet rat. lcarus is not a rat!
And yeah, l'm wearing pajamas! So what's wrong with that?
And whose fault is that anyway? You snatched me from my bed!
You may be a princess and all, but that gives you no right to treat me like this!
What is it?
You're rather amusing.
And you're absolutely right.
Although l invited you l never specified that you dress formally.
And besides. . .
What is it this time?
Your underthings are rather charming.
They're pajamas, l said!
Come, follow me, Nemo.
Hurry. l will show you around Slumberland.
Your rat wants to accompany us, it seems.
He's not a rat.
His name is lcarus.
And call him by name, won't you!
He's my best friend.
Very well. Excuse me. l apologize. lf you're gonna apologize, apologize to the rat, not me.
Er, l mean, l didn't mean. . . lcarus, l didn't mean it.
We're best friends, aren't we? lcarus!
Come down, lcarus. l'm begging you! l'm sorry.
Fine. Then l'll climb up there. lcarus, hold it!
Got'cha!
Nemo!
So his name is lcarus?
Yes.
You are SO precious.
Oh, it's an evening drizzle.
We're having so much fun that the Rain Fairies are jealous.
BonBon! lsn't it pretty? l love this place.
Yes, it's pretty beyond words!
Just in time for lessons.
"Lessons"?
But l hate school. lf you're going to be a prince you need to learn how to act like one.
Step this way.
But what about lcarus? l'll take care of him. Have fun.
Who are these people?
They are all your teachers.
Now, let's begin the lessons.
Sit up straight and let your spoon glide.
We have lunch here at 12:30.
Very nice.
Oh dear.
Next we dance!
En garde!
Advance! Recovery!
Advance! Recovery! Advance! Recovery!
Hey, jump!
"Stand when a lady enters the room."
"Don't spit in front of others."
"Sit up straight."
"Don't yell indoors."
"Open doors for the elderly."
"Don't pick your nose."
Sit up straight! Straight, boy!
More dancing?
Prince lessons ain't easy, eh?
Let's have some pranking lessons too. See there!
They'll come looking for you soon. Wear these.
Ta-daaah.
Flip Jr. is born!
Follow me.
Where are we going?
Just trust me. lt's my house. Home, sweet home.
But it's a police station.
Won't we get caught?
We'll be fine.
Don't worry, l said.
The real fun begins here.
What the?
Why you. . .
Ow! What was that for?
Now you've done it!
Wait, wait, l'll go this way.
Hey, there are two Flips!
Stop, you!
Stop, you!!
This way.
Hey, Flap, wake up!
You've got two passengers. Step on it!
You can do it.
Go!
High in the sky!
Hurry, Flap!
There they are!
Hurry there, boy.
FLY!
Grab ahold, boy.
Sorry, gentlemen.
Let's play again some other time.
Hey, look. Music. lt's an orchestra.
This is it. This is what we call a golden opportunity.
Okay.
Now, it's your turn.
What should l do?
Do this.
Do you understand?
Yes, yes, that's right.
That's very good. You're a natural, kid!
You'll be famous in no time, kid. Just like me.
You're wanted? But why? l was too ingenious for their own good.
Wow, there's lots of towers out here.
That ain't it, boy.
Those're fireworks.
They're all set up to honor you.
Guess it's time for a little rehearsal.
Good idea!
What gorgeous fireworks! Fit for a prince!
Oops. Looks like we got some unwanted attention.
See ya later Flap.
Come, hurry!
Come on, we're going in.
Outsmarting those guys is like taking candy from a baby.
Come, let's go.
Where to?
To an even more amusing place. lt's haunted.
Cut it out, Flip.
This place is kind of creepy.
Don't be scared. The great Flip is with ya. And the real fun begins now.
Woah there. .. Boy! Are ya okay?
Are ya okay? l guess so.
That was quite a spill ya just took.
Look up there.
Looks like you just ran into a big door, kid. l've got a bad feeling about this. l think this is the door the King was telling me about.
What?
He told me not to open the door that has the same symbol as this key.
Let's open it.
But we-
Don't ya wanna know what's inside of it? l'm sure that there's something really, really big on the other side of this door.
Are you sure?
Of course l'm sure.
We'll just take a peek.
What do ya say?
But l promised the king. l swore not to open it.
But l'll keep quiet and he'll never find out.
Just trust me, kid. l guess you're right. . .
A little peek wouldn't hurt.
That's a good boy. l'll give ya a boost.
Hurry and open it, you're heavy, kid! lt's a tough lock.
Well? ls it open?
Look. See that?
Good. Open it.
But.. . we're just taking a peek.
Yeah, l know that.
Don't just stand there, help me.
Oh no!
That was close. l'm leaving. Mommy's calling me!
Flip, wait! l need to take the key out!
Flip, don't go!
Flip! l wonder where that boy went.
The coronation ceremony is about to begin!
His royal highness, King Morpheus!
Prosperity to Slumberland!
My beloved subjects, l welcome you all to my palace for this special ceremony.
The prince can't be late to his own coronation!
Move it, out of the way!
Ah, made it just in time.
Just in time? You're just very late!
And in such tasteless clothes too!
But.. .
No time for excuses!
We can't waste a single second!
Hurry, hurry.
Wait. . .
Don't take my clothes off.
Stop it.
At last he looks like a proper prince.
Calm down. Stay strong.
Come to me.
Oh, l can't stand to watch.
Subjects of Slumberland, allow me to introduce
The worthy heir l have chosen for my throne, Nemo.
As the heir to my throne, he will be henceforth called "Prince Nemo."
He must protect help Slumberland from Nightmare.
And, like this scepter, he is one of a kind.
Bow down to him as you do to me.
Step back.
My heir, behold for yourself the divine powers of my scepter
Jazama Pajama, Pajama Jazama.
Kimera-kazam, imera-tazam.
Paja-paja-jazam
Shazama, pajama, pajama!
Let me warn you all,
The only ones who are able to use this scepter are myself and Prince Nemo.
But he's just a kid. . .
But he is still young and fragile.
This scepter will be bequeathed to Prince Nemo only when he is old enough and strong enough to wield it.
Nemo, the time has arrived. Step forward, my boy. l present you with this crown,
Signifying that you now are in the royal family of Slumberland.
Prince Nemo.
As prince, your duty is to protect the key l gave you and see that no harm comes from it.
Hooray! Hooray!
Let the festivities begin!
Let's dance the night away!
As the king, l cannot let the Professor out-dance me.
Do you not agree, Nemo?
Hold this for me.
Um. . .
Hey.
Doin' fine?
Oh, Flip. . .
That's a pretty thing you've got there. Let me see it.
Don't touch it!
Did you just say something, Nemo?
Eh, uh, nothing really.
Just talking to myself. l shouldn't have opened it. l need to get that key back!
Hold this for me. l'll be right back!
Nemo, where are you going? lcarus! l don't have time to explain.
What's wrong?
King Morpheus!
Please stop the party! Please, stop!
Nemo, did something happen?
Your highness!
King Morpheus!
Want to dance too, lcarus?
Let me through. . . move it, please
Please, let me through!
King Morpheus! lt's Nightmare!
Father!
Nemo, give me the scepter!
Right away!
Nemo, hurry!
Here it is! Take it. . .
Father!
King Morpheus!
Father!
Nightmare. . . how did he get here?
Who opened that door!
He must have done it!
Get him!
Get him now!
But it wasn't me.
Nemo did it.
Flip, what are you saying? l'm sayin' the truth. l saw him do it with my own eyes.
N-no! lt wasn't me! lt was Flip!
But Nemo was the keeper of the key!
Nemo.. .
Nemo?
No! lt-it wasn't me! l-it wasn't!
No. . .
You did it. . . you. . . you.. .
NO!!
So it was a dream. . .
Nemo.. .
King Morpheus?
Where are you?
Nemo.. .
Help me!
Help me, somebody!
King Morpheus. . . l really am sorry.
What's that?
That's it! lt's the Professor.
Professor! lt's Nemo!
This way!
Come this way!
Nemo?
Nemo!
Professor! ls it you?
Take my hand.
Nemo! l thought l'd never see you again.
Where's the king?
Far away.
He was taken away to Nightmare Land.
The entire kingdom is in mourning. lt's all my fault. l did something wrong.
No, it wasn't you.
Flip is at fault.
No. l made a promise to the king.
But l broke that promise. l'll go find the king.
But, without the scepter, there is no hope of you saving him.
The scepter? l've got it right here!
See?
You had it?
Let's deliver it to the king at once! lt's no use.
We don't know where Nightmare Land is.
That's it! Flip has a map.
He does? l saw it.
What horrible timing.
He is about to be banished to outer space!
We need to stop it! Let's be fast!
Row! Row!
Row? Oh, l see. Okay then.
A blindfold? Surely you jest.
Don't make me miss out on the show.
Load the cannon!
What're ya doing?
Let me. . . l'm still smoking!
Hey, lemme out!
Help me! l'll give ya anything.
Help. . .
Ready!
Hurry!
Fire! lcarus! Where did you come from?
Where's Nemo?
Wait! Wait! Hold up!
Don't shoot the cannon!
Nemo! lt's the scepter!
Let Flip free!
What did you say? l'm gonna go find the king.
So you need to let Flip out.
But why?
He has a map to Nightmare Land.
Cancel the sentence!
These're brand label clothes, man!
Now, hand it over, Flip.
Hand over what?
The map to Nightmare Land.
Oh, that thing.
How much are ya willing to pay?
Flip!
Hand it over!
Oh, fine, l get it. You can have it.
Use it well.
Hey, easy, be gentle, man!
Hands off. lsn't it fun?
What's this supposed to mean?
Ah yes, forgot to mention it,
That map doesn't work for just anyone. lt's got a super uncrackable code attached to it.
Then you'll have to come with us.
Me? To Nightmare Land?
Sorry, but l've got errands to run. People to visit.
Prepare the cannon!
Oh fine, l guess l can come along. lf ya make me captain, that is.
After all, l'm the only one who can read the map. ls this lovely princess coming along?
You can hold my cigars for me.
Aww, you look even prettier when you're angry.
Of course l'm coming along.
You are forbidden to smoke while on the voyage!
Anchors aweigh! To Nightmare Land!
Two degrees right.
Aye-aye, Captain!
Watch the aft!
Aye-aye, sir!
Father, l hope you're safe.. .
Don't worry. He'll be okay.
Sail on, fine ship. l am the Captain!
Anything nautical is my specialty.
Owww.
Would you please take this more seriously?
Yes, absolutely, your majestyness.
Er, princess. . .
What's this noise?
Flip! Wake up! You need to take the wheel!
Flip! Help me!
Grab it! Grab on tight!
Are you all okay?
Yes, barely.
Well! My pretty dress is all ruined!
Where are we?
From the looks of things, we're in Nightmare Land.
Really? Ah, yes, of course we are.
See? l brought ya here safe.
Oh no! Looks like goblins!
Those ARE goblins!
Unhand me!
We need to help her!
Pull hard, Professor!
Ah-hah! They were scared of the scepter!
Get away from me!
Flip, the map!
The faster we move, the better. l get it. Hold your horses. . .
What happened, Flip?
Uh, nothing!
The map says. . . this way.
Watch your step. Especially be wary of the goblins. l hate this place. lt looks haunted.
Flip, are there goblins in this forest?
Naw, there ain't any goblins around here.
Which way is Nightmare Castle?
Hey, no peeking!
Just as l thought. Ah, er, this way. lt's a dead end!
Flip! Wonder where he went?
Flip! Flip!
Let's see then. . .
The forest is here.
The swamp is here.
The mountains are here.
And Nightmare Castle is here. . .
No, it's not there. lt's farther north.
Oh, thanks.
Get away, monster!
What's wrong?
Oh dear, we scared him to sleep.
Oh no!
Let Flip go! lt's the scepter! Run for it!
Flip, are you okay?
Yeah, l'm fine.
Wandering off by yourself is dangerous!
You were sneaking in a smoke, weren't you!
Those monsters forced me to smoke against my will.
No, no, we'd never do that. lt wasn't us!
But you ARE goblins.
Stop it, stop it, stop that noise!
Our ears hurt!
Don't do that again!
We're your friends.
We're good goblins.
Are you okay?
We're okay! We're a-okay!
But these guys are goblins!
They attacked me out of nowhere
And they forced me to smoke, l'm telling ya!
We didn't attack him!
And we didn't force him to smoke either!
All we did was help him draw the map!
What?
Er, l. . .
We are shape-shifting good goblins, you see.
Really?
Exactly! l'm Umpu. l'm Umpa. l'm Umpe.
And l'm Umpi!
Well!
One, two, and three!
How silly.
Nightmare is. ..
Very cruel and a liar!
He's so scary that we ran away from him!
But one of our friends is still trapped in the castle.
So we wanna go back and save him.
Nightmare is very frightened of that scepter.
That's why we want you to let us come with you!
Very well.
We know the safest way to get there - we'll guide you.
Not so fast, l'M the guide.
Not anymore. You're fired. l humbly accept your offer.
Yahoo! We got ourselves a good job!
Then what should l do?
You will carry our belongings.
Do you want me to help, Flip?
No thanks. lt may be demeaning, but it's the only job l've got left. l have a question about the spell used with the scepter.
Jazama shazama. . .
No. The second word is "Pajama". l remember that because you made fun of my pajamas.
Not so loud!
Nightmare most likely has spies around these parts.
We need to let Nightmare think that Nemo is very adept at using the scepter.
Yeah, can ya keep it down?
Ya make me carry things during the day, then ya keep me up at night. l've had enough!
A DOG gets better treatment. . .
Nemo! lt's an ambush!
Flip!
Help me!
Nemo.. .
Let me go!
Flip!
This way!
Let me go! l promise l won't smoke again!
Jazama-Pajama!
Dear Princess, l will protect you!
Professor!
Princess! Run away, run away!
Go away! Go away!
Princess! Let her go!
Nemo!
Princess!
Nemo, help me!
Jazama-Pajama!
The scepter!
What a weird dream.
Are you okay, Nemo?
What are you doing here?
We've been here all along.
So l'm still dreaming then?
Dreaming? What's dreaming?
Well, it's. . . l get it! This place is called a "dream"!
Ohhh, l get it.
Exactly, exactly. l thought so all along!
Princess. . .
Jazama-Pajama!
Hey, it's Unpo! lt's Unpo! l thought so all along!
Unpo! Were you okay?
Unpo! l am so happy to see you all again.
Wait, is that your friend you were looking for?
Yes, he's the friend that was left behind. l'm very pleased to see you, l'm Unpo
Hi. l'm Nemo.
So you're Nemo! l have a letter from you, from King Morpheus.
From the King? Where is he right now?
The last time l saw him, he was locked up in Nightmare Castle.
Where's the Princess?
Where's the Professor?
Princess?
Let me see the letter!
Here it is.
This is the spell that goes with the scepter! lt's a secret incantation. When spoken, it releases immeasurable power.
Enough power to defeat Nightmare.
That's wonderful!
But why did the King send me this?
Let's go to Nightmare Castle at once!
The King is waiting for us!
Yay! Nightmare!
Owww, that noise hurts!
Stop making the noise!
Don't scream!
My ears hurt!
Wait, wait, are you saying that if Nemo chants the spell, he'll die?
Oh dear, that is a problem. l'm worried. l was worried all along. lcarus, l'm honored that you're concerned about me.
But the king needs me. l'm sure that the King and the others are all suffering in Nightmare Castle. l need to go save them.
And l want you to come with me, lcarus. l need your help.
Okay?
Then it's decided!
Hurry, to the King!
Let's go! lt's an adventure!
Ah, me too! me too!
Okay, guys, you'll have to navigate me.
You can count on us!
And we're off to Nightmare Castle!
We're off!
Goooo!
To Nightmare Land!
Here it is! Wind Gate!
That's the entrance to Nightmare Land!
So we're finally in Nightmare Land.
Guys, ready? Keep your guard on Nemo!
Single-form transformation. . .
Go!
Hot! So hot! Someone put me out!
Watch out!
What was that thing?
Nemo! Look forward!
Look at that! lt's Nightmare Castle.
Guys! Are you ready?
Hold on tight!
Here we go!
Are you all okay?
Yes, we're okay. . .
Well then, there's supposed to be a secret entrance around here somewhere.
That impudent Nemo and that troublesome scepter,
We have cleanly disposed of them both, my Lord.
You will have full control of Slumberland in time.
All hail Nightmare Land!
There!
What? Nemo is in the castle? And he carries the scepter with him?
You filthy traitor!
Help! We're getting sucked in!
Help me!
What's wrong?
We're being pulled in.
How's it happening? l don't know!
Don't let go!
Where are we? lnside Nightmare Castle.
What was that noise? l'm not sure. l can't see anything.
Maybe we should try coming in again after it's light?
Watch out!
Let's get out!
Run and hide!
Hurry! Hurry! lt's coming!
There's the secret entrance! Hurry! lt's that way!
Ah, that was close. lsn't this a great hiding place?
We built it together.
Even Nightmare doesn't know about it.
He can't see us in here, but we can see him.
Do you seriously think you're well hidden? l know exactly where you are. l think he sees us.
Nope. He's trying to trick you.
Hand over the scepter, Nemo, and l will let you escape.
Answer me!
Now, Nemo, my patience wears thin.
Perhaps this will entice you to change your mind?
Princess! Professor! Flip!
Do you like my collection?
Stop it!
Oh, so that's where you were hiding, Nemo.
Your days are over.
That's right. l have one more item in my collection.
Perhaps this was what you wanted to see most?
King Morpheus!
How horrible!
Your Highness! l have the scepter!
Did you think he would be so easy to rescue?
Nemo!
Hurry! Get him!
Hurry!
Nemo!
Caught him!
There he is!
Nemo! Hurry!
Chant the spell, fast!
Jazama-Pajama,
Pajama-Jazama!
Shimera-Kazam!
Hurry, hurry, we're running out of time!
Ki. . .Kimera-Kazam!
What came after that? lmera-tazam!
Paja-Pajap-Shazama!
Paja. . .umm. . .
Pajap-Shazam!
Shazama-Pajama
Shazama-Pajama!
Oh no! He's coming back!
Now, let's be reasonable.
Hand over the scepter. lf you do, l will send you straight home.
To your Mommy.
Jazama-Pajama!
Pajama-Jazama!... ls that the only part you remember?
Pa. . .Pajama-Pajama
Ooooh, just the sound of the word "pajama" gives me chills.
Nemo! Behind you!
Jazama-Pajama!
Pajama-Jazama!...
Very good, lcarus! Hold on tight.
Shimera-Kazam!
Kimera-Kazam!
Nemo, don't let go!
We've got you!
Kazam. . .Shazama!
We're losing him!
Shazama. . .Pajama. . .lcarus!
Pajama!
Wh-where am l?
Nemo!
Wake up, Nemo!
Please.
Open your eyes!
How horrible!
Nemo!
Your Highness. . . l broke my promise
And l opened that door. l'm truly sorry.
No. . . Your courage defeated Nightmare.
The evil kingdom has fallen.
For all eternity.
Little Nemo, you are a perfect little prince.
Huzzah!
Farewell!
Farewell! Farewell!
Keep being a good prince, Nemo!
Hey, kid!
Flip.
Hey, Nemo, l'm gonna look after Slumberland whenever you're gone.
Jazama-Pajama!
Flip-Flap!
Pajama!
Oh, cut it out.
Flip, what are you doing!
Flip, cut it out.
Help me!
Flip, are you okay?
Flip! An official order from the Prince of Slumberland.
You are never to smoke. Forever! l second that. And we're serious this time!
Fine, fine. Adios! Nemo, my boy!
Take care, Flip!
How beautiful!
Oh, look! That's my town!
Come to me, lcarus.
Nemo.. .
What? l had so much fun.
Thank you. . . Nemo.
M-me too.
Nemo!
Nemo, wake up. lt's breakfast time.
Well! You didn't fall off your bed this morning, l see.
Did you say something?
Well, you have so much fun in store for you today.
Oh, it was all a dream.
A wonderful dream.
Looks that way. l can tell by your smile.
Mom, l'm sorry l broke my promise and took the pie.
Good morning, Nemo.
Get ready right away.
Get ready? For what, Dad?
"Get ready for what"?
We're going to the circus today.
Wanna go, Nemo?
The circus? Really? Can lcarus come, too?
Of course he can.
All right! lcarus, wake up!
We're going to the circus!
A shadow shall fall over the universe...
...and evil will grow in its path...
...and death will come from the skies.
What did you bring me?
You'll see.
Wait. Wait for me.
What is it?
Do not try to escape.
You are in my control.
Look at me.
I am the sum of all evils.
Look carefully.
My power infests all times, all galaxies...
...all dimensions.
But many still seek me out.
A green jewel they must possess.
But see how I destroy their lives.
Right 12 degrees.
Yeah, New York. Big deal.
Scum center of the world.
Now they're even talking about letting in lowlifes from other planets too.
My name's Harry Canyon.
I drive a cab.
Hey, you free?
Yeah, get in.
-Where to, pal?
-The U.N. building.
The U.N. building.
What a joke. They turned it into low-rent housing. It's a dump.
Okay, sucker, hand over your cash.
Now!
Stupid asshole.
Nobody touches Harry Canyon unless I want them to.
Father!
Run!
He's dead. Get the girl.
Help me! Please!
Normally, my rule's don't get involved.
But somehow, hey, this dame got to me.
The Loc-Nar....
They-- They wanted it, but my--
My father wouldn't tell them...
...and now I'm the only one.
Hey, relax, sister, there's a cop station up here.
You can tell them....
Oh, shit. Just what I needed.
-Police. What do you want?
-I wanna report a murder.
-What else is new?
-Hey, you gonna let me in or what?
Yeah, hang on.
Harry.
How you doing, Harry?
Hiya, Harry.
She couldn't take it, huh?
Hey, kiss my ass, will you?
I'll do it for 20 bucks.
I told you, I'm an American citizen.
I-- I just lost my papers or something.
Goddamn illegal aliens.
Before you go any further, pal,
I gotta tell you, it's cash upfront.
Thousand bucks a day for a full investigation...
...another thou if the assailant is caught. Understand?
Yeah. Hey, here's a dollar.
Thanks for nothing.
You think you can do better? Punk.
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful girl.
I knew she was gonna be nothing but trouble.
Where am I?
-My place.
-They'd have killed me if not for you.
What did they wanna snuff you for anyway?
The Loc-Nar.
An ancient relic that my father found in the desert.
It's worth a fortune, especially to the Venusians.
They think it has spiritual powers.
Does it?
All I know is that since we found it, people have been dying all around us.
When we got to New York, my father hid it.
Now he's dead.
They'll kill me next. I'm the only one who knows where it is. They'll....
Listen, nobody's gonna find you here.
You can sleep on the couch if you want.
And there's beer in the fridge.
So help yourself, all right?
I didn't know whether to believe her or not.
Something inside me told me....
Was a sucker play.
Harry?
Can I sleep with you?
Yeah, sure.
Sucker play or not, I must have turned her on something fierce...
...because this dame was going for broke.
Or maybe it was her first time with a New Yorker, I don't know.
Anyway, nothing can beat good old American know-how...
...and I was giving this broad the stars and stripes forever.
-Where's the girl?
-Where--? What--? What girl?
Don't play dumb with me, cabby.
You showed up at the station...
...with a broad over your shoulder.
Where is she?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Listen, cabbie, you hear from her, you call us.
You don't, you're dead. Understand?
Don't hold your breath, pal.
-Where's the girl?
-Come on. Not again.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I'll get right to the point,
Mr. Canyon.
My name is Rudnick.
I represent a group of investors from a nearby planet...
...who wish to purchase something from the young lady.
The price is fair, but they're starting to get very restless.
When you see her, tell her that time is running out.
Thank you, Mr. Canyon. Good day.
The burning smell kept reminding me
I shouldn't have got involved.
But for some reason,
I just couldn't get her off my mind.
There was something about her.
An element of danger.
It really turned me on.
Transcom Message Service.
Message for Harry Canyon.
Will you accept the charges?
Meet female acquaintance at Statue of Liberty, 4:00.
Stop. End message.
The girl. Had to be her.
But first, I had to ditch a couple assholes.
That's what all the excitement's about?
I wanna get rid of it, Harry.
I want this to be over.
I talked to Rudnick.
He said he'd give me
300,000 Krono-dollars for it.
But-- But I'm frightened.
I don't trust him.
Three hundred grand is a lot of dough.
Will you help me?
When she looked at me like that...
...I knew I couldn't say no.
I'll come along for 50 percent of the take.
You can have anything you want.
Just stay with me.
There they are.
Okay. I'll keep you covered.
Hey, baby, we're rich.
What do you say we take a trip?
Hey, just the two of us.
I'd like to, Harry, but I've made other plans.
I'm taking it all.
Pull over.
-Are you sure this is what you want?
-Positive.
Pretty, but dumb.
You know, even though she would've killed me, I kind of felt sorry for her.
She was okay, just a little greedy.
As for me, I put it down as a two-day ride with one hell of a tip.
You've had your first lesson, young one.
My evil corrupts the most innocent.
I've chosen you because you possess powers...
...you do not yet understand.
Look again.
Look deep into me.
In some worlds,
I'm worshipped as God.
It all started when I found the green meteorite.
I read in Faraday's Life of the Planets that smaller ones like this...
...are supposed to burn up when they enter the atmosphere.
But for some reason, this one didn't.
So I brought it to my room, stuck it in my rock collection and forgot about it.
I was experimenting with natural electricity...
...and with the storm warnings up,
I figured tonight I'd hit the jackpot.
All I needed was a little juice.
It works!
No hair.
Big.
There was no way I was gonna walk around this place...
...with my dork hanging out.
This looked like something right out of The Ten Commandments.
Ullatec
Ullatec
Ullatec
By the powers of the glowing Loc-Nar placed in your idol's hand...
...I demand you come forth, Ullatec!
Grant me your strength in return for a living mortal sacrifice.
It has been ordained.
Come forth, Ullatec. I demand it.
What'd they do that for?
Normally, I'd be dead by now.
I kept thinking I was gonna run out of air, but my new body worked great.
I just hoped her body was working as good as mine.
Thank you.
She had the most beautiful eyes.
I wanted to make some conversation, but I found my new self...
...asking the same old stupid questions.
Are you from around here?
Well, you may not believe this, but I'm from another world...
...from a place called Earth.
Earth? I, too, am from Earth.
My name is Katherine Wells, and I'm from the British colony of Gibraltar.
You saved my life.
I have no reward to give you...
...but if any part of me pleases your senses...
...I would give it to you willingly.
This was great.
There was no way I'd get a chick like this back on Earth.
There was only one problem.
Come.
I don't know who these assholes were...
...but they sure picked a bad time to show up.
They split us up and took me to this weird castle-type place.
I wanted to find out where they'd taken Katherine...
...but none of these guys seemed to speak English.
They tell me you are Den of Earth.
The one who dared to steal the female sacrifice from the queen.
This guy was a shrimp, so I figured I'd play it tough.
Where is the girl?
I am Ard...
...supreme leader of the revolution and the next ruler of the world.
The girl!
Well, aren't we fierce?
Guards, castrate him.
Boy, I was pretty good at this stuff.
Excellent. You are worthy to serve me.
Give me the girl or die.
-Well, if I have a choice, I'll take death.
-So be it.
You'll have to do better than that.
I could see why they made this guy their leader.
But if you're really interested in the girl...
...I've had her encased in glass.
-She's dead.
-Actually, no. She's sleeping.
-But only I can awaken her.
-What do you want of me?
I want you to steal the sacred Loc-Nar.
-What is this Loc-Nar?
-The queen's glowing sphere, fool.
The sacrifice to Ullatec can only be performed...
...by the possessor of the sacred Loc-Nar.
Norl!
This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
You will go with him to the queen's castle and steal the Loc-Nar.
-Then I will give you the girl.
-And if I refuse?
If you refuse, you die, she dies, everybody dies.
Sounded reasonable to me.
Guard post ahead.
We must go underground.
This guy Norl seemed to know what he was doing.
And for a gorilla, his English wasn't half bad.
We're underneath the castle moat.
What are they saying?
They talk of the beast who prowls these catacombs...
...with a fierce hunger and sharp teeth 6 inches long.
Sorry, 16 inches long.
Now we separate.
You and Korg take this door into the queen's quarters.
The rest will move through the walls...
...and enter her chamber from the other side.
Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will return it to Ard.
Good luck, Den.
Loc-Nar.
It was just like the ball
I dug up in the yard.
As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow,
I had this real funny feeling.
Then the lights came on.
Talk about embarrassing.
Kill them.
Can I slit his throat, Your Majesty?
Yes, slit his throat.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Stop! I have.... I have something better in mind.
-Come with me.
-Jeez, not again.
This always happens.
She's the queen.
She can do whatever she wants.
-Yeah, sure.
-Sure.
If you please me, I may let you live.
-What must I do?
-Satisfy my appetites.
Eighteen years of nothing, and now twice in one day. What a place.
The rising moon climaxes our love, Den.
-It is a sign.
-Yes, a sign.
I had no idea what she was talking about.
Neverwhere is a troubled land.
Your strength has brought great peace to my restless body.
It could bring great peace to all the troubled people of this land.
I knew I was good, but I didn't know I was that good.
Your Majesty, the Loc-Nar is missing! Stolen!
Fiend! You make love to me while your accomplice steals my scepter.
Now Ard will perform the sacrifice.
Guards! Take him! Hold him still.
I will kill him myself.
Boy, was she pissed off.
Prepare the fliers! I want his head!
By the power of the magic Loc-Nar placed in your hands...
...I command you.
Come forth, Ullatec!
Here is your sacrifice.
Ullatec, now give me your power.
Throw her in.
-Katherine!
-Den!
No! You'll ruin everything.
-Kill them! Kill them both!
-The Loc-Nar is mine!
-Stupid bitch. Get away from me.
-Give it to me.
-Give it to me.
-The Loc-Nar's mine.
Don't you take it.
I know what a Loc-Nar is.
It's my Loc-Nar.
-Where did they go?
-They're gone. That's all that matters.
They probably went back to Earth.
Boy, will Mom be surprised.
The Loc-Nar.
You could have the power of Ullatec.
You could be ruler of all these people.
Forget it.
But, Den, with the Loc-Nar, you could've returned to Earth.
I like it better here.
On Earth, I'm nobody.
But here, I'm Den.
Even when someone has the strength to discard me...
...my power is not diminished.
Someone always finds me.
Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?
I am.
Lincoln Sternn, you stand here accused...
...of 12 counts of murder in the first degree...
...14 counts of armed theft of Federation property...
...22 counts of piracy in high space...
...18 counts of fraud...
...37 counts of rape...
...and one moving violation.
How do you plead?
Not guilty.
Not guilty? Are you nuts?
It's okay, Charlie. I got an angle.
Call the first witness.
But the prosecutor's got you cold.
You're as guilty as a cat in a goldfish bowl.
The prosecution calls
Hanover Fiste.
Calling Hanover Fiste.
-Hanover Fiste.
-Calling Hanover Fiste.
Listen, Sternn, change the plea to guilty.
Throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
I told you, Charlie, I got an angle.
But the most we can hope for is to get you buried in secrecy...
...so your grave don't get violated.
-Plead guilty.
-Shut up, Charlie.
I got an angle.
What angle?
Him.
State your name for the record.
I am Hanover Fiste.
You know the defendant,
Captain Sternn?
Yes, I know Captain Sternn.
And never did there live a kinder, more generous man.
I promised him 35,000 zuleks to testify on my behalf.
He's an overflowing cup, filled with the very cream of human goodness.
In all the time I've known him, he's never done anything immoral.
See?
Unless maybe the preschoolers' prostitute ring.
And he's never done anything illegal--
Unless you count all the times he sold dope disguised as a nun.
He's always been a good, law-abiding citizen--
Give me a break!
--of the Federation, and-- And--
Shut up. Shut up!
--a community-conscious individual.
Sternn.
He's nothing but a low-down, double-dealing...
...backstabbing, larcenous, perverted worm.
Hanging's too good for him.
Burning's too good for him.
-Hanover....
-He should be torn...
...into little bitsy pieces and buried alive!
Hanover....
I'll kill him. Kill!
Kill!
Hey, hey, Hanover, take it easy.
I'm sure we can talk this over.
Good.
Lost him.
Sternn!
Okay, Hanover, you've had this coming.
Now, let's see.
Thirty-three, 34...
...35,000 zuleks.
Thanks, Hanover.
-It's nothing, boss.
-And, Hanover.
-Yes?
-Goodbye.
Very few escape my grasp.
Even in death, my powers continue.
Even in death, my powers continue.
Come on, Stefan. Drop the fuckers and let's get the hell out of here.
We're hit pretty bad, Skip.
You'd better go back and see how bad it is.
Okay.
-Can you keep her in the air, Skip?
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Nelson?
Jeez.
Skip, something's following us.
-What is it?
-It's some kind of green meteorite.
What? Where?
Holden, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming back, Skip.
What the hell's happening back there?
Shit.
No. No!
No!
From one war to another, my influence is always present.
The paltry armies of the universe are but playthings to me.
Please, Dr. Anrak! Dr. Anrak!
Dr. Anrak, six more mutants were sighted in Arizona this morning.
Do you still say this has nothing to do with the green radiation from space?
Doctor, is it true that the president pulled you off the Jupiter Six project...
...so you could investigate those mutations?
Doctor, answer me that, please.
Please, the green radiations from space....
Well, what I wanna know is, what's the Army doing about this?
Hell, my constituents are turning green.
They're growing arms on their backs.
There's something or someone up there in space...
...and voters have a right to know about it.
Senator, we have no proof...
...that these mutations are the result of interference from outer space.
In fact, Dr. Anrak has just come in, so let's hear what he has to say.
-Doctor?
-First of all, there's no cause for alarm.
As for the theories of interference by alien beings...
...it is my firm opinion that we on Earth...
...are the only intelligent, technically advanced civilization...
...present in the universe.
-Thank goodness.
-That's a relief.
I was scared for a while, you know.
Very reassuring, very reassuring.
And-- And whatever is causing these mutations...
...is not from outer space.
It's more likely just an isolated biological phenomen--
Pretty. Pretty.
What is this? Doctor!
Oh, nice job.
How am I gonna fix this guy?
He's fucked.
Guess we turned it up a little too high.
-Sorry, man.
-You're sorry. What about me?
I gotta put this asshole back together.
-Where am I?
-Hey, who's the chick?
Look at my clothes.
Who's gonna pay for the dry cleaning?
I demand you return me to my office immediately.
Too late. Molecular--
Molecular instabilities...
...all around the spacecraft.
You cannot leave.
What? Is he kidding?
Oh, yeah. Instability zone.
You're stuck here.
But I have to be at my parents' for dinner tonight.
And my gynecologist appointment is on Wednesday.
Not anymore.
Would you like a drink?
Come with me.
You'll feel better after a glass of fresh blo-aak.
You have any diet soda?
Oh, typical robot.
The first Earth chick we see in 10 years...
...and he's gotta make a play for her.
Hey, do we have any of that
Plutonian nyborg left?
Yeah. Just one bag.
It's in the transmitter compartment.
Thanks, man.
Oh, great.
Think this is enough?
-No, go for broke.
-Good thinking, man.
-Nosedive!
-Nosedive!
Good nyborg.
That was incredible.
I've never felt anything like it.
Oh, great. I've been programmed to be fully proficient in sexual activities.
-Do you want to go steady?
-Gee, I don't know.
I already have a boyfriend, but....
What he does not know will not hurt him.
But I'd feel so guilty.
Of course you would.
Earth women who experience sexual ecstasy with mechanical assistance...
...always tend to feel guilty.
Really?
But I don't understand.
We laugh together...
...care for each other.
We have highly proficient sex.
Why can't we get married?
Look, we're different, okay?
Let's leave it at that.
What do you mean, different?
But mixed marriages just don't work.
I'm afraid that I'll come home one day and find you screwing the toaster.
You'll just have to trust me.
All right, all right, I'll marry you.
But on one condition:
I want a Jewish wedding.
A Jewish wedding? Okay.
I forgot, are you circumcised?
You okay to land this thing?
No problem, man.
I think you're going a little high, man.
It's okay, man.
If there's one thing I know, it's how to drive when I'm stoned.
Like, you know your perspective's fucked...
...so you just gotta let your hands work the controls as if you're straight.
Good landing, man.
My stories are almost over.
I have chosen you...
...because you are the future who could destroy me.
With your death,
I break the chain for all time.
Look into me one final time.
See my evil destroy your race.
Then prepare to die.
Death.
Death!
Death to all who oppose us!
To the council chambers!
They're killing everyone.
We must escape.
The city is burning.
Elder, we must arm ourselves.
We must fight.
Silence!
We are not a race of warriors.
We are statesmen and scientists.
From our very beginning, it was ordained...
...that the warrior race of Taarak the Defender...
...would aid us in times of need.
This was the pact.
Taarak the Defender?
His race is dead.
They cannot defend anyone.
Some say that the race is not dead, that one still lives.
One? What good is one?
One of Taarak's blood can do much.
Elder, they're in the hall!
Well, who is this last Defender?
How can he be summoned?
It is Taarna, of the blood of Taarak the Defender, the last of the race...
...and must be summoned as my forefathers summoned Taarak himself:
From within.
But will this Defender answer?
A Taarakian has no choice.
They must answer.
It is in their blood.
They're at the door.
They're here!
In the halls, quickly.
We must do something.
Bar the door.
We will summon the Defender together.
Taarna.
Taarna.
Taarna.
Taarna.
Taarna.
To defend, this is the pact.
But when life loses its value and is taken for naught...
...then the pact is to avenge.
Hey, look. A new one.
Where you from, baby?
Doesn't talk much, does she?
She doesn't have to talk for what I wanna do with her.
Come on, baby, let's see what's under there.
Hey, she's tough.
Maybe she wants to fight.
Or maybe she wants to take us all on.
You'll find them over there, beyond the oasis...
...towards the green glow.
A Taarakian.
We have captured a Taarakian.
A Taarakian?
Are you sure?
Yes, Your Holiness.
But the Taarakian race is dead...
...extinct.
She has the marks, Holiness.
I saw them.
Have her bound and washed.
Then...
...bring her to me.
And what of the bird?
Kill it.
So this is the Taarakian.
Somehow, I thought it would be more difficult...
...to capture a Taarakian.
My whips.
Pull him down.
I'll put an arrow through his head.
Mount the bats!
I want her dead!
This time you die, Taarakian bitch!
Taarna.
Do not sacrifice yourself.
You cannot destroy me.
No!
No!
No!
And the spirit of Taarna is transferred across the universe...
...to a new Defender...
...and the power of evil is contained...
...for another generation...
...and a new Taarakian is born...
...to protect the next.
This is James Henry Trotter.
He lived with his mother and father in a cosy little house by the sea.
Hey. I've got ya.
Happy birthday, darling.
Now, quickly. Blow them out before the wind does.
Make a wish first.
It was a wonderful life.
They had each other, and they had their dreams.
Look!
That cloud looks like a camel.
And that one over there looks like a train engine.
Now, can you see the tallest building in the world?
I can't find it.
Try looking at it another way.
I see it!
That's where we're going... on a great ship that will take us across the ocean.
And we'll go right to the top of that building.
The three of us, on top of the world.
Are there any kids there like me?
Hundreds of them.
It's a wonderful place,James.
A city where dreams come true.
Then, one day, a terrible thing happened.
An angry rhinoceros appeared out of nowhere... and gobbled up his poor mother and father.
Their troubles-- if they had any at all-- were over in 35 seconds flat.
But James's troubles were just beginning.
For now, he lives here with Aunt Sponge...
Get up, you lazy little bug. and Aunt Spiker.
- You already wasted four minutes of daylight.
- Look at him.
Lollygagging in dreamland when there's so much work to be do.
Weeds to pull, wood to chop.
Work, work, work, work, work!
Wouldn't want one of those nesting in your knickers.
I look and smell--
I do declare-- as lovely as a rose.
Just feast your eyes upon my face.
Observe my shapely nose.
Behold my heavenly, silky locks.
And if I take off both my socks, you'll see my dainty toes.
But don't forget, my dearest Sponge, how much your tummy shows.
You lazy bug!
- Who told you to stop working?
- I finished the wood.
A travel book? How dare you even dream of leaving!
This is the only home you'll ever have.
No one else would tolerate a worthless little nothing like you.
Where did you get this? Where?
Father gave it to me.
He said we were to go there one day.
- Stupid, foolish man.
- Foolish man. Always dreaming.
- That's what got him killed.
- And your mother.
Had his head in the clouds instead of looking where he was going!
- He never even saw that rhino coming.
- That rhino.
And the beast will get you, too, if you don't behave.
Now get these stupid dreams out of your head!
And get back to work!
Careful, Spongy. Wouldn't want to ruin that girlish figure.
Oh, shut up.
- Yes?
- I've finished all of the chores.
What a coincidence.
We've finished all the dinner.
Oh, Sponge.
You're such a tease.
There's something special waiting for you in the oven.
Oh, do let me guess.
They're not good enough for him.
What do you think this is?
Buckingham Palace?
Get out of our sight!
Go on!
Go on!
Hello there!
Where did you come from?
You know, you probably shouldn't build your web up here in the window.
Spiker and Sponge might see you, and they hate spiders.
I'll be your friend, though.
My name is James
That's what Mother called me
My name is James
So it's always been
Sometimes I forget
When I'm lonely or afraid
Then I'll go inside my head
And look for James
Here's something
I've never shown anyone.
There's a city that I dreamed of
Very far from here
Very, very far away from here
Very far away
There are people in the city
And they're kind to me
But it's very, very far away you know
Very far
They'll say, James, James
James, how are ya
Isn't it a lovely day
James, James, James
We're so glad you came here
Where we are
From so very, very, very far
My name is James
James, James
Good night. Pleasant dreams.
Spider! Vermin! Oh, beast!
No! Wait!
- Spider!
- Wait! I'll get it! I'll get it!
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!
Where is it?
Get it! Get it!
- Kill it.
- Get it! Get it!
Kill it!
You hit me in the face.
You hit me in the face!
Oh, do shut up!
Go on. Get out of here. Get as far away from this place as you possibly can.
Oh, I wish I could.
What's stopping you?
Oh, don't be frightened,James.
I mean you no harm.
How'd you know my name?
I know more than just your name.
What would you say if I were to tell you... that the answer to all your troubles is right here... inside this little bag?
- Hey! That's my--
- Of course it is.
Go on,James. Have a look.
There's more magic in them things... than in all the rest of the world put together.
But what are they?
- Crocodile tongues.
- Tongues?
One thousand long, slimy crocodile tongues.
Boiled in the skull of a dead witch for 20 days and 20 nights.
Add the fingers of a young monkey, the gizzard of a pig, the beak of a parrot and three spoonfuls of sugar.
Stew for a week, and then let the moon... do the rest.
Have 'em, and marvelous things will happen.
Things even you never dreamt of.
- Like what?
- Well, like... you'll never be miserable again.
And you are miserable, aren't you,James?
You weren't meant to be, you know.
And that place you're dreamin' of, it's not as far away as you think.
New York City!
And it'll be that much closer, once you take the first step.
But how? This doesn't make any sense.
Not up here, it doesn't.
The answers are in here, and the magic is in here.
So,James, what'll it be?
Now listen to me,James. Don't let them get away, because if they do, they'll work their magic on whoever or whatever they meet first.
Understand?
Good.
What's going on out here?
No! No, wait!
Wait! No! No, wait!
Wait.Just a-- Wait.
Here he is.
Get up, you little worm!
- We sent you out here to kill a spider.
- Not to laze about.
I wasn't lazing about.
I tripped.
How dare you disagree with us!
Beat him, Sponge.
It's too early.
Well, that makes you the luckiest boy alive.
Now come inside and get dressed.
Spiker, look! A peach.
- A what?
- A peach! There! On that branch.
Why, that old tree's never had so much as a blossom on it, let alone a--
Well, I'll be blowed.
There really is a peach there.
A nice, big one too.
How can we get it?
- The boy.
- Now, you be a good little boy... and climb up there and get that peach for your dear aunties.
- Can we eat it?
- Of course we can. We'll share it.
Me and your Aunt Spiker!
Now start climbing.
- Wait!
- What? What? What?
It's-It's growing!
- The boy?
- No. The peach, you idiot!
Look!
- Come down.
- But I won't get hurt.
Climb down!
What a peach. What a peach!
Look, Spiker! It's still growing!
I'm not blind, you dolt.
I can see it myself.
Look at it go! It's a miracle!
It's coming down. Stand back!
My heavens! My--
Marvelous things will happen, just like he said.
Shut up, you little grub.
This has nothing to do with you, so just keep away from it.
Can you smell that, Spikey?
It smells delicious.
No!
It smells like money.
Roll up. Roll up.
See the giant peach.
The Eighth Wonder of the World.
Have your money ready, ladies and gentlemen.
Chance of a lifetime.
Ten bob only.
No peeking at the peach! Have your money ready, ladies and gentlemen.
In you go.
- Can we touch it?
- Touch it? You want to touch it?
- She'll be wanting to taste it next.
- Admission refused.
This child has too many cheeky ideas. Go away!
- Quite right.
- Ooh, splendid.
A photographer.
- And another.
- Best side.
- Move on in.
- No cameras allowed.
Don't dawdle. Come along, ladies and gentlemen!
- Sorry, Father. It'll cost you double.
- May God forgive you.
Thank you, Father.
Come along, children.
Last chance of the day.
Yoo-hoo! Come down here.
Yes, Auntie Sponge?
Ooh! You're all spiffed up.
I was hoping to play with the children.
The children have gone.
But you can play with their garbage.
Garbage.
And don't even think of going near our peach.
'Cause if you do, remember:
They never did catch that rhino.
No! Wait a moment! Wait!
'Ere, now. Where do you think you're going, Yank?
I'm goin' stir crazy.
I gotta take a look around.
Plan our escape from Spiker and Sponge.
Escape? To where? We'll all be squashed, swatted, smooshed!
No one's going to smoosh you, my dear boy.
- You're six feet long now.
- Bigger target.
Let the biddies come.
I'll take 'em both on.
I'm indefeatable.
I'm indivisible. I'm...
- Whoa!
- in trouble!
It's Spiker and Sponge!
They've found us!
Hello!
No, no, no. It's the lad from the house. What's his name?
- Miserable tick.
- I thought it was " rotten little grub.''
No. That's what those horrible aunts call him.
His real name is--
Well, it's-- uh, uh--
It's James.
Look what you've done now, miss.
Scared him to death.
Please! Don't eat me!
- Eat you?
- Hey, Glow-worm. Turn up your lights.
- I'm a vegetarian.
- I eat dirt.
No one will be eating you,James.
Nah. She'll just puncture your head and suck out the brains.
- That I am saving for you.
- Whoa! Pretty fast, long legs.
Oh, such rude behaviour.
There's no need to be frightened, dearie.
But you're enormous bugs!
Fascinating, isn't it?
We've all changed, and so have you,James.
The old man-- the one who gave me the green things-- he said marvelous things would happen.
Did he say,
"marvelous pigs in satin''?
No, dear lady.
"Marvelous things will happen.''
Poor Glow-worm.
She's a little deaf.
I, however, have exquisite hearing.
Yeah? Well, listen to this.
Let's get outta here!
You mean leave the hill?
I can't! The rhino will get me.
Rhino?
I say, dear boy.
I've lived on this miserable hill for decades.
There are no rhinoceri here.
Except for Sponge.
She's twice as big as a rhino, eh, kid?
And twice as dangerous.
My life hangs by a thread every day.
I've had to send all 300 of me children to safer pastures.
Hah! You think hiding in solid rock is fun?
I can't even remember what fun is.
Well, that's just 'cause you been stuck here too long.
Listen to me, kid. I know a place that will refresh your memory.
Bright lights
Big city
That's where we gotta go
Where the food is great and the bugs are so pretty
I'd like to get my arms around a hundred or so
I'd hug 'em, squeeze 'em hold 'em tight
Sleep all day
Dance all night
I want the bright lights and the big city
That's the life for me, yeah
That's the life for--
You little maggot
Have you never seen the moon
Gliding 'cross the western sky
A dead oak tree by the waterside
Putrid vapours rising
That sounds lovely, dear.
I'm sure we all agree.
But I prefer the sunshine
A little park right in the centre of the town
Flowers everywhere
Children all around me, I'd love it
Landing on a baby's cheek so warm
- It's wonderful
- Wonderful
That's the life for me
That's the life for me
That's the life
That's the life for me
- Elegant conversation
- Bright lights, big city
- An elevated point of view
- That's where I'd go
- Intellectual stimulation
- Yeah, maybe for you.
And someone you love to share it with you
It would be wonderful
Wonderful
- That's the life for me
- You call that a life?
- That's the life for me
- It's no pile of dirt.
That's the life
That's the life
That's the life
That's the life for--
Where are you hiding, boy?
Time to go make a pest of myself.
Look at this place.
It's still filthy.
Where are you, you detestable little worm?
Not you. Me!
You better not be near our peach.
Oh, please!
Don't let them spray us!
Spray us? They'll see the Yank up there and come after us with a shovel.
- It happened to my brother.
- How awful.
Split him right down the middle.
Now I have two half-brothers.
Shh! They'll hear us.
Yoo-hoo! Where are you, boy?
I think I hear a rhino out here.
Ahh. This'll be a snap.
Shh! I really do hear something.
Timber.
- What's that?
- Fasten your seat belts, kids.
Ahh! The car!
- We're turning!
- Wha-Wha-What have you done?
Start, start, you piece of junk.
It's the peach! Our peach!
We'll be killed!
Whoa! I'm falling head over head over head!
Here, stomach! Here, stomach!
Here, stomach!
I'm gonna be sick.
Our peach!
Where are we?
Ow! Somebody pinched me.
Sorry. I thought you were the spider.
Ouch! What was that?
Excuse. I thought you were the centipede.
Hey, Glow-worm.
How about some light?
I can't hear you, dear.
I'll have to put my light on.
Oh! Oh! This is so "unladybug-like.''
Don't worry. I'll have you right-side up in no time.
Thank you,James.
- Where are you going?
- To see where we've landed.
Whoa!
Oh, my!
Oh, my, my.
Oh, my achin' back.
Oh!
Fascinating, isn't it?
What? What's fascinating?
Tell me. Don't leave me dangling.
We're in the middle of the-- how do you say-- the big puddle?
Biggest puddle of them all, angel fangs. The Atlantic Ocean.
Technically, the Pacific is larger.
Well, that goes without saying.
But there is land in sight?
Nothing but blue skies and clear waters.
- This is all your fault.
- Hey!
If it wasn't for me, we'd all be Spiked and Sponged by now!
This old man with his green things-- did he happen to speak to where we are going?
No. All he said was the answers would be right here.
My travel book!
And look! It's the peach!
We're going to New York City!
New York? They love me there!
Wonderful! They've got a whole park full of leaves for you, Miss Ladybug.
- Central Park.
- And loads of dark hiding places.
- Nightclubs.
- And museums and concerts.
- Not to mention Yankee Stadium.
- What about me?
Why, they've got miles and miles of underground tunnels.
The subway!
My father says it's the place where dreams come true.
- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me
- That's the life
- That's the life
That's the life
That's the life for me
New York it is, then.
Now, how do we get there?
- I'll get us there!
- You?
Sure! I've sailed all the five seas.
From the sun-drenched reefs of Bora Bora... to the icy shores of Tripoli.
"Commodore Centipede,'' they used to call me.
- Seven.
- Huh?
There are seven seas, and Tripoli is in the subtropics, Commodore.
- Trim the sails!
- There are no sails.
- Stoke the engine!
- There are no engines.
I can't work with this miserable crew.
Great! We're stuck here until we shrivel up and die.
- Highly improbable.
- That's a relief.
We're far more likely to drown.
Oh, no!
I know! We could--
No. It's a stupid idea.
- Compared to what?
- Hey!
Well, we could fly out.
He's right. It's stupid.
How would you do it,James?
With the seagulls, but we'll need string.
Oh. Well, I'll just go to the stationer's... and pick up some paper clips while I'm at it.
I have string.
Miles of string.
And we'll need bait; bird bait.
Bird bait? Where do you expect we're gonna find bird bait... out here in the middle of the-- the--
Oh, no! No, no!
Have you lost your minds?
They've lost their minds!
Anything but birds!
Don't worry. I'm right here.
- Now wiggle.
- No!
But they won't come if you don't wiggle.
Exactly!
And you can't make me.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, no fair! Mockingbirds munched me mother!
Here comes the first one.
Get ready to pull down there.
My sisters were swallowed by swallows!
Pull!
It worked! I got one!
Shh! I hear teeth.
Great, big, gnashing teeth.
Sounds like a rhinoceros.
In the ocean?
Scientifically impossible.
I hear something too.
It's a school of tuna.
They're being sucked into some sort of machine.
- What do you mean?
- Take a look.
It's a giant shark!
It seems to have spotted us.
- What do we do? What do we do?
- The seagulls!
It's our only chance!
It would take the whole flock and then some. We'll never do it in time.
We'll use Miss Spider's web for a net. Hurry!
Throw it here, dearie.
Wiggle, Mr Earthworm.
Our lives depend on it.
I can't! I'm all wiggled out.
Here. Let me help you.
Come and get it!
Get your fresh, hot wienie!
Come on, baby.
I got 'em! Hand me the loops!
- Hurry!
- Shake a leg, there.
Keep your pants on.
I've only got 1 2 hands.
It's getting closer.
Seagulls, away!
- Oh, no!
- Oh, dear!
They're getting away!
Hop on,James!
Now, grab them!
Help!
Hooligans! Ruffians!
Degenerates!
- Come on, seagulls!
- Put your backs into it!
Shake your bloomin' tail feathers!
Good sharky. Nice sharky.
Sharky!
Hooray!
All right! Teach you to mess with me, you overgrown sardine!
I'm from Brooklyn.
Pure twaddle! Every bug on board displayed extraordinary courage.
Why, did you see Miss Ladybug risk life and wing... to bash those brutes on the snoot?
Well, they were being very rude.
I can't abide rudeness.
We are all forgetting something.
Everything we did was part of the brilliant plan of James.
It really did work, didn't it?
- I say three cheers for James. Hip-hip.
- Hooray!
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!
New York, here we come!
Whoever you are, keep away from me! Keep away!
Mr Earthworm, it's me!
Oh,James!
Oh, thank goodness.
You mustn't frighten yourself like this all the time.
- Why not?
- You'll make yourself sick.
When I had a problem, my mum and dad would tell me to look at it another way.
How? First I was bird bait.
Then I was shark bait.
I suppose. Or you could say you gave us wings to fly... and defeated a giant shark single-handedly.
- No-handedly.
- Exactly. You're a hero.
I am? I'm Wonder Worm!
You are.
Want food.
Food.
Are you sure you know where we're going?
I don't see how you can navigate without a compass.
It's very hot up here.
I'm roasted.
- Unhand that bird!
- But I'm dyin' of hunger.
Well, perhaps I have a bit of soda bread in here somewhere.
- Food?
- It's not much, but it's--
- Not so fast!
- Hey!
- You?
I need this food.
I have a much higher metabolism.
- Bite me!
- What?
- Have you two gone mad?
Let go of it, gramps!
- Give it! Give it to me!
- Let go of my coat!
- Give it to me!
- Ow! My lower thorax.
- I'll rip you apart!
- I tell you, it's mine!
- Give it back!
Now look what you've done!
We're going to starve.
Waste away. And not quickly.
Oh, no. That would be the easy way out. We'll linger.
Slowly. Miserably. Painfully.
Nobody's going to starve.
Don't you see? We have enough food here for five voyages.
- Food? Where?
- Is there really food?
- What are you talkin' about?
Our whole ship is made of food.
Oh, such a clever little boy.
Takes after me.
After you, there is nothing left to take.
Delectable!
- Better than aphids.
- Better than ladybugs.
- What?
- Excuse.
It's not dirt, but it's not bad.
"Not bad''? It's the best thing
I've ever tasted, and I have tasted a lot.
I've eaten many strange and scrumptious dishes in my time
Like chilli bugs and curried slugs
And earwigs cooked in slime
And mice with rice is very nice
When they're roasted in their prime
But don't forget to sprinkle them with just a pinch of grime
I'm crazy 'bout mosquitos on a piece of buttered toast
And pickled spines of porcupines and then a great, big roast
And dragon's flesh
Quite old, not fresh
It costs a buck at most
Does it come with gravy?
It comes to you in barrels if you order it by post
It comes to you in barrels if you order it by post
For dinner on my birthday
Shall I tell you what I chose
Hot noodles made of poodles on a slice of garden hose
And a rather smelly jelly
Made of armadillos' toes
The jelly is delicious
But you have to hold your nose
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
I crave the tasty tentacles of octopi for tea
I like hot dogs but I love hot frogs and surely you'll agree
A plate of soil with engine oil's a super recipe
Recipe
I hardly need to mention that it's practically free
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
We hardly need to mention that it's practically free
Now comes, my fellow travelers the burden of my speech
- You show-off!
- These foods are rare, beyond compare
And some right out of reach
Nice aim, Commodore.
But there's no doubt
I'd go without
A million plates of each
Out of my face!
- For one small mite
- One small mite
One tiny bite
Tiny bite of this fantastic peach
- Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Stop! Stop!
- Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Wha-Wha-Wha-What's going on?
- Bull's-eye!
- Comin' at you!
- Watch this!
This fantastic peach
You keep to yourself, don't you?
I prefer to be alone.
I was alone for a long time once.
I think it's much nicer to have friends. Don't you?
I would not know.
They would be your friends too-- the others, I mean-- if you'd just let them.
No. It is in their nature to have fear of me.
- This I cannot change.
- You're very kind to me.
Maybe this is because you are kind to me first.
You were the spider in my window!
You were my first friend.
I mean, since I went to live with my aunts.
- They hated me!
- Shh! Do not think of them now.
But what if they find us?
What if we don't make it to New York?
I'll die if I have to go back to the way I was! They can't make me!
Nobody can make you do anything,
James, if you do not let them.
You are a brave boy.
Now, to sleep.
You have had a very tired-making day.
Look! The little maggot's stuffing his face with our peach!
Get him, Sponge.
You can't crawl away from us!
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.
The rhino will get you.
The rhino will get you.
The rhino will get you!
This is an outrage!
You are a disgrace to your phylum, class, order, genus and species!
- Say it in English!
- You, sir, are an ass!
Where are we?
What's going on?
I found this dime-store Timmy asleep at the helm.
- Now we're lost.
- We are not lost!
- Then where are we?
- Somewhere north!
Or possibly very, very far south.
What's your latitude?
What's your longitude?
Hey, hey, hey!
That's personal, bub.
- You said you could navigate!
- You said you'd traveled the world.
You said you'd been to Bora Bora.
- Well, not Bora Bora, per se. Uh--
- What about the shores of Tripoli?
Did I say "Tripoli''?
I meant the halls of Montezuma.
- That's what you said.
- Never have I heard such mendacity!
- You liar.
- Charlatan!
- Wait!
If he says he's seen the world, then he's seen the world.
Right, Mr Centipede?
Right?
Well, I did used to live between two pages of a National Geographic.
-Huh?
-Very informative magazine, the National
Geographic. Wonderful pictures.
You incompetent, blithering nitwit!
All right, hoppy!
Them's fightin' words!
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Come on! Give me your best shot!
Whoa! Good shot.
Did you see what he did to me?
Hmph! Serves ya right.
- What do we do now? Which way do we go?
- Oh, it's simple, really.
All we need to do is determine our coordinates, then use triangulation to chart a direct route to New York.
- Then there's hope.
- Don't be ridiculous.
There's no hope at all.
We don't have a compass.
We'll never reach New York.
We're gonna be stuck here forever.
We're gonna be frozen like living statues.
Dead living statues.
No dark hiding places.
No cosy leaf in the park.
No city where dreams come true.
- Don't ships have compasses?
- No doubt.
But to brave those icy waters would mean certain death.
Only a fool would do it.
Geronimo!
- What? What? What was that?
- The centipede jumped in!
Good heavens!
He's committed pesticide!
Oh, this is all my doing.
Don't take all the credit.
I helped too.
- I have to go after him!
- Not on your life. You'll catch your death of cold.
- But he's my friend!
-James is right.
Centipede is one of us.
Get on my back. I am going with you.
- You had better take good care of him.
- This I promise.
Stay by the line, and when you feel two tugs, pull us up.
A skellington?
Jackpot! A genuine compass!
Sounds like you need a little oil, Captain.
Thank you, sir!
I'll be shovin' off now.
I shoulda worn a belt!
Holy shipwreck!
Listen, fellas. I got a long history of back problems, and I don't need it to get any longer.
Hey. That one felt pretty good.
It's Paul Bunyan comin' to cut me some slack.
Whoa! Hey, pal.
You're aimin' a little low.
He's gonna cut me in half!
Hey, sailors!
Looking for some kicks?
Cut me loose!
Get the compass!
I've got it!
Gotcha!
Polly want a smacker?
Look out!
- Sounds like big trouble.
- Get ready to pull.
I got a good one for ya. Why don't skeletons play music in church?
Oh. Thank goodness!
You're all right.
- What happened to Centipede?
- He found a compass for us.
- And a shipload of pirates!
- Hold this. I am going back.
Do be careful, Miss Spider.
Poor Centipede.
He saved our lives down there.
- Look out!
- Miss Spider!
- Centipede!
- How am I lookin', kid?
Oh, Centipede. I do not know whether to kill you or kiss you.
- Well, I-- Say, I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- My sincere apologies.
- I just, I just wanna apologize.
- I just wanted to say--
- What I'm tryin' to say--
That's enough chit-chat!
I'm freezing!
Hello? The compass is ready.
Mr Centipede, would you please do us the honour... of navigating us out of this icebox?
It would be my pleasure.
I believe our position puts us very close to--
I admire your bravery,
Miss Spider. I really do.
Why, thank you, Mrs Ladybug.
All right, boys.
Coffee break's over.
I'm looking forward to a hopping good time... in the Big Apple, Mr Centipede.
You said it, Mr Grasshopper.
Oh, boy. What I wouldn't do for a cup of coffee.
Cup of joe.
I say, old sport. Came to relieve you of your duties.
I said I'd steer the peach.
Have to steer the peach.
- Can't quit now.
- Good show, old boy.
Thanks, Mr Grasshopper.
- That music.
- Oh, Sir James! D-Did I disturb you?
So sorry.
I-I-I-I'll put this away.
No, no! I like it.
I used to hear it at my aunts' house before I went to sleep.
That was you, wasn't it?
Or do all grasshoppers play music?
All grasshoppers try.
I'm sure you've heard this.
Ghastly, isn't it? Cricket stuff.
- Music should be the voice of the soul.
- What does that mean?
It means that when I'm happy, my music sounds like this.
And when I'm sad, it's like this.
When I was sad, I used to climb in bed with my mum and dad.
But that was a long time ago.
I'm sure they'd be very proud of you,James.
I know we are.
Take a little time
Just look at where we are
We've come very, very far
Together
And if I might say so
And if I might say so too
We wouldn't have got anywhere
If it weren't for you, boy
Love is the sweetest thing
Love never comes just when you think it will
Love is the way we feel for you
We're family
We're family
- We're family
- All of us
And you
Think of where we'd be
- If we were on our own
- We'd be dead.
- You're what holds us all together
- I am?
And if I might say so
And if we might say so too
We never could love anyone
As much as we love you
- Love
- Is the strangest thing
Love
Does exactly what it wants to do
- Love
- Boy, ya know it's true
We're family
We're family
We're family
Me, me, me, me, me and you
Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Without you there'd be no "us''
Love is the sweetest thing
Love does exactly what it wants to do
Love is the way we feel for you
We're family
We're family
We're family
Me
And you
We'll always be together, won't we?
Kid, you're stuck with us for life.
Look, everybody. We made it!
- We did?
- New York City.
- Breathtaking!
- Stunning!
- Oh, how glorious!
- Look at the park!
- It's fabulous.
- We have made it!
What a wonderful sight!
There's Lady Liberty.
I can almost smell the lovely dirt.
- Is it not beautiful?
- The Empire State Building!
See those lights! Wa-hoo!
Yippee! Attaboy, Jimmy!
Good show,James!
The city awaits us.
Now, remember,James. First impression is very important.
- Oh, no!
- We'll be blown off course!
We'll wind up in Jersey!
- Could it be--
- No. It couldn't be.
- It's the rhino!
- Oh,James. Do something.
Everyone, climb up into the rigging!
Hurry!
James, are you not coming with us?
No! It got my mum and dad.
It won't get my friends!
Come out and show your face, you stupid beast!
Good God Almighty!
Remember what your parents said,James:
"Try looking at it another way.''
You're not even a real rhino!
You're just a lot of smoke and noise!
I'm not afraid of you!
I'm not afraid of you!
James!
No!
Miss Spider? Mr Grasshopper?
Hello? Is anyone there?
This isn't right.
Where's the Empire State Building?
What in the--
Officer! There's a boy up there!
What? A boy?
Mabel, we got us a huge, unidentified object here.
- What's it look like?
- Round, fuzzy.
- It looks sorta like a giant fruit or something.
- Well, what is it?
I don't know what it is!Just send us the biggest crane in New York!
Please, sir. How do I get to the Empire State Building?
You're on top of it, kid.
We made it!
Well, I made it.
Hang on.
Have you seen any big bugs tonight?
Big bugs? How big?
I hope they're all right.
Let's go. Let's go.
Stay back. Stay back.
Don't worry, kid.
You'll be all right.
Come on, sonny.
Don't be afraid, now. I got ya.
Stay away from the fruit!
- Who's that? Hey!
- What is this thing?
- Where you from?
- Why you here?
- Who?
- What?
- Where?
- When?
- Hold your fire, fellas!
He's just a kid, for Pete's sake.
Here. I got you now.
It's okay, little guy.
Nobody's going to hurt ya.
Move back for them.
No.
Hello, little angel.
So kind of you to look after our little lost lamb.
- Who are you?
- We are the boy's legal guardians.
And we've missed him so much.
So we'll just take him home now.
And the peach, of course.
We're taking that as well.
Well, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Back up.
You mean to tell me that this thing is a peach?
- It's not " a peach.'' It's our peach.
- Our peach.
- Show him, Spongy.
- Yes.
-Looks like it's their peach, all right.
-Yes.
- Yes, and we're very proud of it.
- We're going to be in the record books.
It's not their peach.
The old man gave the green things to me.
- That's what made it grow.
- How dare you disagree with us!
Patience, sister.
Remember his condition.
- His condition?
- He's a chronic liar.
Sad, really.
He needs his treatment.
Well, that's why we're here; to bring him home.
So you come here with us, eh, lovey!
I'm not the one who's lying.
They are!
As you can see, Officer, it is urgent that you release him to us immediately.
Let the boy speak!
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Let the boy speak!
All right! All right! All right!
Let's get to the bottom of this.
This thing is a peach.
All right. I'll buy that.
Now, does somebody want to tell me how it got here?
We attached it to a hundred seagulls.
Seagulls?
That's what happened!
Me and Miss Spider and the centipede and the old green grasshopper.
I think he's gone mad.
This is all something he dreamed up.
Well, maybe it started that way, as a dream, but doesn't everything?
Those buildings, these lights, this whole city!
Somebody had to dream about it first, and maybe that's what I did.
I dreamed about coming here, but then I did it.
- The poor boy needs his medicine.
- Yes.
- So we'll just take him--
- And the peach. back to our cosy, little house on the hill.
Come along.
You're going home with us.
No, I'm not.
What did you say?
I said, "No, I'm not!''
I hate that house and that cold room and how I was always hungry.
All right! That's enough!
- And how you beat me!
- He's lying!
- And told me I was nothing!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
- No! Not this time.
I flew the giant peach across the ocean.
I landed on top of the tallest building in the world.
I made it! I'm not the one who's nothing. You are!
And I'm never going back with you!
Not me, and not the peach.
How dare you speak to us this way?
James! Up here!
Hello! We're here!
- Hey, buddy!
- What are they?
- Young James.
- Hey,Jimmy!
- Bugs!
- Need a little help down there?
Giant bugs!
Hey, you old biddies!
- Help us!
- Whoo-ee! Here we are, dear.
Hello,James!
I told you they were real.
- Hello, old boy.
- Requesting clearance to land.
Miss Spider, throw me a string.
Okay. Pull them up.
Help!
Where are we going?
- Spin them around.
- You little--
Wrap them tightly!
Tighter! Tighter!
Well, I'll be a--
The kid was tellin' the truth.
Get those two creeps outta here!
Stop the presses!
I got a new front page!
"Big Bugs In The Big Apple.''
In big, bold print: " A Little
Lindy Flies Giant Peach.''
"Half-Pint Hero
And His Peach-Pit Pals.''
Everyone, these are my friends; the ones I've been telling you about.
- Mr Centipede.
- Hi.
- Old green grasshopper.
- My pleasure.
- Earthworm. Mrs Ladybug.
- Charmed.
Miss Spider. And the glow-worm.
God bless the colonies.
- Could we eat some of your peach?
- It won't keep forever.
Go ahead.
Hey! What was your name?
It's James.
They ate that peach all the way down to the pit... and set it up in Central Park as a permanent home.
And James Henry Trotter, who once was the saddest and loneliest little boy you could find, now had a loving new family... and all the friends in the world.
James, dinner is ready.
All right. Nearly finished.
And since James's visitors begged him again and again... to hear the story of his adventure with the giant peach, he wished for a way to share it with everyone.
And that is exactly what you have just seen.
Once upon a time there was a vulture and a hog
Livin' in a house up on a hill
Had this little boy who lived with them
They worked him like a dog
With any luck they'd have him up there still
'Long came a magic man with a magic bag
Full of nasty little green things in a funky old rag
He said, Boy, you may not know it but this here's salvation you see
Son, you're going down in history
Good news is blowin' in your window
Good news is knockin' on your door
Good news is comin' 'round the corner
Good news is rollin' 'round your floor
Where can all my troubles be
Must be good news chasin' me
Good enough to set everybody free
Good news, good news, good news
Good news
There were bugs in the garden
Didn't have a clue
But every day their life was on the line
They wanted to get out of there but they didn't know what to do
Their little brains was workin' overtime
- Well
- That all changed one sunny day
That little boy dropped by to say
If we all work together we'll make out okay
- We will
- Good news, good news, good news
So they rolled down the mountain flew over the sea
Facin' death and danger on their way
But together they have made it
They're where they want to be
They love each other more and more each day
They care about each other
Good news is sweepin'
'cross the country
Good news is spreadin' all around
Good news is hittin' in the city
Good news has sprung up in the town
The things that used to hurt before
They don't hurt 'em any more
'Cause they know there's somethin' good in store
- Good news
- Good news
- Good news
- Good news
- Good news

TANGLED 2010 DVDRIP - PRESTIGE
* = Music or songs
Lovingly cooked by 'Bake Master'
(Flynn Ryder narrates)
This is the story of how I died.
Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.
This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.
And it starts, with the sun.
Now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.
And from this small drop of sun, grew a magic, golden, flower.
It had the ability to heal the sick, and injured.
Oh, you see that old woman, over there?
You might want to remember her.
She's kind of important.
Well, centuries pass and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.
The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.
And the Queen, well she was about to have a baby,
but she got sick,
really, sick.
She was running out of time.
And that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.
Ahhh, I told you she'd be important.
You see instead of sharing the suns gift,
this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power
and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.
And all she had to do, was sing a special song.
Mother Gothel: *Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine*
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine*
*What once was mine*
Flynn: All right, you get the jist. She sings to it, she turns young, creepy, right?
We've found it!
Flynn: The magic of the golden flower, healed the queen.
A healthy baby girl, a princess was born.
With beautiful golden hair.
I'll give you a hint.
That's Rapunzel.
To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.
And for that one moment, everything was perfect.
And then that moment ended.
Mother Gothel: *Flower, gleam and glow, let your powers shine*
*Make the clock re...*
HUH!
(Baby cries)
Flynn: Gothel broke into the castle,
stole the child, and just like that...gone.
The Kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the Princess.
For deep within the forest
In a hidden tower.
Gothel raised the child as her own.
*...bring what has been lost, bring back what once was mine, what once was mine.*
Flynn: Gothel had found her new magic flower.
But this time she was determined to keep it hidden.
Why can't I go outside?
The outside world is a dangerous place.
Filled with horrible, selfish people.
-You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
-Yes, Mommy.
But the walls of that tower, could not hide everything.
Each year on her birthday, the King and Queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky.
In hope that one day, their lost
Princess, would return.
HAH!
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's not hiding out here.
GOTCHA!
That's twenty two for me.
How about twenty three, out of forty five?
Okay, well, what do you want to do?
Yeah, I don't think so.
I like it in here and so do you.
Oh, come on Pascal, it's not so bad in there.
*Sings "When will my life begin"*
*7a.m. the usual morning line-up*
*Start on the chores I sweep
'til the floors all clean.*
*Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up.*
*Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15.*
*So I'll read a book, or maybe two or three.*
*Ill add a few new paintings to my gallery.*
*I'll play guitar, and  knit, and cook and basically.*
*Just wonder when will my life, begin.*
*Then after lunch, it's puzzles, and darts and baking.*
*Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet, and chess.*
*Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.*
*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.
Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.*
*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*
*And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush, and brush my hair.*
*Stuck in the same place
I've always been.*
*And I'll keep wondering, and wondering, and wondering...*
*Wondering, when will my life begin?*
*Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.*
*Just like they do on my birthday, each year.*
*What is it like, out there where they glow?*
*Now that I'm older. Mother might just let me go.*
Wow!
I could get used to a view like this.
-Ryder, come on.
-Hold on.
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.
We do this job, you could buy your own castle.
Oh, hay fever?
Yeah.
Huh?
Wait, wait.
Hey, wait!
Can't you picture me in a castle of my own?
'Cause I certainly can.
Oh, the things we've seen and it's only eight in the morning.
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.
This is it. This is a very big day, Pascal.
I'm finally going to do it.
-I'm going to ask her.
-RAPUNZEL!
Let down your hair.
It's time.
I know, I know. Come on, don't let her see you.
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any younger down here.
Coming, mother.
Hi, welcome home, mother.
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do that every single day, without fail, it looks absolutely exhausting, darling.
Oh, it's nothing.
Then I don't know why it takes so long.
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.
All right...so, mother.
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.
Rapunzel look in that mirror.
You know what I see?
I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.
Oh look, you're here too.
I'm just teasing, stop taking everything so seriously.
Okay, so mother. As I was saying, tomorrow...
Rapunzel, mother's feeling a little run down.
Would you sing for me, dear?
-Then we'll talk.
-OH! Of course, mother.
*Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine,
Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*
*Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design.
Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine.*
-Rapunzel!
-So, mother,
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!
TADA!
No, no, no can't be.
I distinctly remember. Your birthday was last year.
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.
And I wanted to ask, what I really want for this birthday.
Actually what I want for
(Mumbles 'every birthday')...
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.
You know how I feel about the mumbling.
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.
-What?
-Oh,...
Well I was hoping you would take me to see the floating lights.
Oh, you mean the stars.
That's the thing
I've charted stars and they're always constant.
But these, they appear every year on my birthday, Mother.
Only on my birthday.
And I can't help but feel that they're,
They're meant for me.
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.
In person.
I have to know what they are.
You want to go outside?
Oh, why Rapunzel.
Look at you, as fragile as a flower.
(Gothel Sings "Mother knows best")
*Still a little sapling, just a sprout.*
-*You know why we stay up in this tower*
-Rapunzel: I know, but...
*That’s right, to keep you safe, and sound, dear.*
*Guess I always knew this day was coming.*
*Know that soon you'd want to leave the nest.*
-*Soon, but not yet. Shhh..*
-But
*Trust me pet,
Mother, knows best.*
*Mother knows best,*
*listen to your mother.*
*It's a scary world out there.*
*Mother knows best.*
*One way or another, something will go wrong, I swear.*
*Ruffians, thugs, poison Ivy, quicksand.*
*Cannibals, and snakes, the plague...yes.*
*Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth.*
*And stop, no more, you'll just upset me.*
*Mother's right here, mother will protect you.*
*Darling here's what I suggest.*
*Skip the drama, stay with Mama.*
*Mother, knows best.*
*Mother knows best.
Take it from your mumsey.*
*On your own, you won't survive.*
*Sloppy underdressed, immature, clumsy,*
*Please, they'll eat you up, alive.*
*Gullible, naïve, positively grubby.*
*Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague.*
*Plus I believe, getting kinda chubby.*
*I'm just saying,
'Cause I wuv you.*
*Mother understands,
Mothers here to help you.*
*All I have is one request.*
-Rapunzel?
-Yes?
Don't ever ask to leave this tower, again.
Yes, Mother.
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Don't forget it.
*You'll regret it.*
*Motherrrrrrr.*
*Knows best.*
Ta, ta, I'll see you in a bit, my flower.
I'll be here.
No, no no. This is bad, this is very, very bad, This is really bad.
They just can't get my nose right.
Who cares.
Well it's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.
All right, okay. Give me a boost, and I'll pull you up.
Give us the satchel first.
Wha..? I just...
I can't believe, that after all we've been through together, you don't trust me.
Ouch.
Now help us up, pretty boy.
Sorry, my hands are full.
What?
RYDER!
-Retrieve that satchel with any force.
-Yes, sir!
We got him now, Maximus.
Heeyah!
Heeyah! Come flea-bag, forward.
No.
No, stop it.
Stop it.
Give it to me.
HAH!
-AHHHHH!
-WHINNEYY!
Oh!
Alone at last.
Huh?
Aah!
Okay, okay, I got a person in my closet.
I've got a person in my closet.
I've got a person in my closet!
To weak to handle myself out there, huh Mother?
Well, Tell that to my frying pan.
Hmmm.
Rapunzel!
Let down your hair.
One moment, Mother.
I have a big surprise.
Uh, I do too.
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.
I seriously doubt it.
I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.
Surprise!
Well mother, there's something
I want to tell you.
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight.
Especially when I've done absolutely nothing wrong.
Okay, I've been thinking a lot about what you said, earlier.
I hope you're not still talking about the stars.
Floating lights, and yes
I'm leading up to that.
Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart.
No Mother, I'm just saying, you think I'm not strong enough to handle myself out there.
Oh darling, I know you're not strong enough to handle yourself out there.
-But if you just...
-Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.
-Trust me,...
-Rapunzel.
-...I know what I'm
-Rapunzel.
-Oh, come on.
-Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.
You are not leaving this tower,
EVER!
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.
All I was gonna say, mother is that...
I know what I want for my birthday, now.
And what is that?
New paint. That paint made from the white shells you once brought me.
Well that is a very long trip,
Rapunzel.
Almost three day's time.
I just thought it was a better idea than, uh, stars.
You sure you'll be all right, on your own?
I know I'm safe, as long as I'm here.
I'll be back in three days time.
I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Okay.
Hmm.
AHHH!
Is this...hair?
Struggling...struggling is pointless.
Huh?
I know why you're here.
And I'm not afraid of you.
What?
Who are you, and how did you find me?
Ah hah.
Who are you, and how did you find me?
I know not who you are.
Nor how I came to find you.
But may I just say.
Hi!
How you doing?
The name's Flynn Ryder.
Flynn mumbles:
How's your day going, huh?
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?
-All right, Blondie.
-Rapunzel.
Gesundheit, here's the deal.
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.
I came across your tower and...
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll never find it.
It's in that pot, isn't it.
Huh?
Ahh, will you stop that.
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.
So, what do you want, with my hair?
-To cut it?
-What?
-Sell it?
-No!
Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair, is to get out of it.
Literally.
Wait, you don't want my hair?
Why on earth would
I want your hair?
Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it, end of story.
You're, telling the truth?
Yes.
Hmmm.
I know, I need someone to take me.
I think he's telling the truth, too.
Doesn't have fangs, but what choice do I have?
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
-Deal?
-Look this way.
Oh...oomph!
Do you know what these are?
You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?
Lanterns...
I knew they weren't stars.
Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky, with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,
Take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely.
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.
That is my deal.
Yeah, no can do.
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren't exactly, simpatico, at the moment. So I won't be taking you anywhere.
Something brought you here,
Flynn Ryder.
-Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
-A horse.
So I have made the decision to trust you.
A horrible decision, really.
But trust me, when I tell you this.
You can tear this tower apart, brick by brick.
But without my help, you will never find your precious satchel.
Let me just get this straight.
I take you to see the lanterns.
Bring you back home, and you'll give me back my satchel?
I promise.
And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.
EVER!
All right, listen, I didn't want to have to want to do this, but you leave me no choice.
Here comes the 'smolder'.
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.
Really!
-Ooops.
-You broke my 'smolder'.
You coming, Blondie?
*Look at the world so close, and I'm half way to it*
*Look at it all, so big do I even dare?*
*Look at me, here at last
I just have to do it.*
Should I? No.
Here I go.
*Triumphant music*
(Rapunzel sings When will my life begin)
*Just smell the grass, the dirt.
Just like I dreamed they'd be.*
*Just feel that summer breeze.*
*The way it's calling me.*
*For like the first time ever,
I'm completely free.*
*I could go running, and racing, and dancing...
*and chasing, and leaping and bounding.*
*Hair flying, heart pounding and splashing and reeling.*
*And finally feeling,*
*That's when my life begins.*
I can't believe I did this.
I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!
Mother would be so furious.
That's okay, what she doesn’t know won't kill her, right?
Oh my gosh, this would kill her.
THIS IS SO FUN!
I am a horrible daughter,
I'm going back.
I am never going baaaccckkk!
I am a despicable human being.
WAHHOOOOO!
Best day, ever!
You know, I can't help but notice, you seem a little at war with yourself, here.
-What?
-Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces, of course, over protective mother, forbidden road trip.
I mean, this is serious stuff.
But let me ease your conscious.
This is part of growing up.
A little rebellion, a little adventure.
That's good, healthy even.
(Laughs) You think?
I know. You're way over thinking this, trust me.
Does your mother deserve it?
No.
Will this break her heart and crush her soul?
Of course.
But you just got to do it.
Break her heart?
-In half.
-Crush her soul?
Like a grape.
She would be heart broken, you're right.
I am, oh my, oh bother.
All right, I can't believe I'm saying this, but...
I'm letting you out of the deal.
-What?
-Flynn: That's right.
Flynn: But don't thank me. Let's just turn around, and get you home, here's your pan and your frog.
I get back my satchel.
You get back a mother daughter relationship based on mutual trust and viola!
We part ways as unlikely friends.
-No, I am seeing those lanterns.
-Oh, come on!
What is it going to take to get my satchel back?
I will use this.
Is it, ruffians, thugs?
Have they come for me?
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.
Oh, sorry.
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though.
Yeah, that probably be best.
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.
-Where?
-Oh, don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.
Oh, a Palace horse.
Where's your rider?
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
Rapunzel, let down your hair.
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel!
RAPUNZEL!
I know it's around here, somewhere.
Ah, there it is.
The Snuggly duckling.
Don't worry, very quaint place, perfect for you.
Don't want you scaring, and giving up on this whole endeavor now do we?
-Well, I do like duckling.
-YAY!
Garcon, your finest table, please.
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.
Really let that seep in.
What are you getting?
Because to me, it's part man smell. and the other part is really bad man smell.
I don't know why, but overall, it just smells like the color brown.
Your thoughts?
That's a lot of hair.
She's growing it out, is that blood on your moustache?
Goldie, look at this, look at all the blood on his moustache.
Look sir, that's a lot of blood.
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.
Maybe we should get you home.
Call it a day.
Probably be better off. This is a five star joint after all.
And if you can't handle this place, well maybe you should be back in your tower.
Is this you?
No, no this is being mean.
Oh, it's him all right.
Gretel, go find some guards.
That reward's going to buy me a new hook.
I can use the money.
What about me?
I'm broke.
-Boys, stop!
-We can work this out.
Hey, leave him alone.
-Gentlemen, please.
-Give me back my guide, ruffians.
HOO, HAH, HOO, HOO!
Not the nose, not the nose, not the nose!
Put him down!
Okay, I don't know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns, because I've been dreaming about them my entire life.
Find your humanity.
Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?
I, had a dream.
Once.
(Song: I've got a dream)
*I'm malicious mean and scary.*
*My sneer could curdle dairy.*
*And violence-wise my hands are not the cleanest.*
*But despite my evil look, and my temper and my hook.*
*I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.*
*Can't cha see me on the stage performing Mozart.*
*Tickling the ivories,
'til they gleam.*
*Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.*
*For my killer show-tune medley.
Thank you.*
*'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream.*
*He's got a dream, he's got a dream.*
*See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem.*
*Though I feel like breaking femurs.*
*You can count me with the dreamers.*
*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*
*I've got scars and lumps and bruises.*
*Plus something here that oozes.*
*Let's not even mention my complexion.*
Big nose thug: *But despite my extra toes.*
*And my goiter and my nose.*
*I really want to make a love connection.*
*Can't you see me with a special little lady.*
*Rowing in a row boat, down the stream.*
*Though I'm one disgusting blighter.*
*I'm a lover, not a fighter.*
*'Cause way down deep inside, I gotta dream.*
*I gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*
*And I know one day will never reign supreme.*
*Though my face leaves people screaming.*
*There's a child behind it dreaming.*
*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*
*Tor would like to quit and be a florist.*
*Gunther does interior design.*
*Ulf is into mime,
Attila’s cupcakes are sublime.*
*Bruiser knits, Killer sews.*
*Fang does little puppet shows.*
*And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns.*
What about you?
-I'm sorry, me?
-What's your dream?
No, no, no. Sorry boys,
I don't sing.
*I have dreams like you, no really.*
*Just much less, touchy-feely.*
*They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny.*
*On an island that I own, tanned and rested and alone.*
*Surrounded by enormous piles of money.*
*-I've got a dream...I've got a dream.
-(Thugs) She’s got a dream.*
*I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam.*
*And with every passing hour.*
*I'm so glad I left my tower.*
*Like all you lovely folks,
I've got a dream.*
*She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream.
They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.*
*So our differences ain't really that extreme. We're one big team.*
*Call us brutal, say sadistic and grotesquely optimistic.
*'Cause way down deep inside, we've gotta dream.*
*We gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*
*Yes way down deep inside
I've got a...*
*Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.*
Yeah!
I found the guards.
Where's Ryder, where is he?
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him, turn the place upside down if you have to!
Go, live your dream.
I will.
Your dream stinks,
I was talking to her.
Thanks for everything.
I believe this is the man you're looking for.
You got me.
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.
Maximus.
What's he doing?
A passage, come on men, let's go.
Corman, make sure those boys don't get away.
Play it safe.
We'll go get the crown.
I gotta dream,
I got some dream.
I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.
Because I just found me a tall drink of water.
Oh stop it, you big lug.
Where does that tunnel lead out?
Knife!
Well, that got us safe.
Didn't know you had that in you back there. That was pretty, impressive.
I KNOW!
I know...
Sooo, Flynn.
Where are you from?
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do back story.
However I am becoming very interested in yours.
Now I...I know I'm not suppose to mention the hair.
-Nope.
-Or, the Mother.
-Uh, uh.
-Frankly I'm to scared to ask about the frog.
-Chameleon.
-Nuance.
Here's my question though, if you want to see the lanterns so badly, why haven't you gone before?
Uhh, hey, well...
Uh, Flynn...
Flynn!
Run,
RUN!
Who's that?
They don't like me.
-Who's that?
-They don't like me either.
-Who's that?
-Lets just assume for the moment, that everyone here doesn't like me.
Here.
I've waited a long time for this.
Oh mama, I have got to get me one of these.
HAH!
You should know that this is the strangest thing I've ever done.
How 'bout two out of three?
Flynn!
Flynn, look out.
-Whoa, WHOAAA!
-Hold on.
You should see your faces.
Because you look...
Ridiculous
Come on, Blondie.
Jump.
It's no use,
I can't see anything.
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch black down there.
This is all my fault.
She was right, I never should have done this.
I'm so...
I'm so sorry, Flynn.
Eugene.
What?
My real name is,
Eugene Fitzherbert.
So you might as well know.
I have magic hair that glows when I sing.
What?
I have magic hair, that glows when I sing.
*Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.*
We made it.
Her hair glows.
We're alive.
I'm alive!
I didn't see that coming.
You're hair actually glows.
-Eugene...
-Why does her hair glow?
-Eugene!
-What?
It doesn't just glow.
Why is he smiling at me?
I'll kill him.
I'll kill that, Ryder.
We'll cut him off at the kingdom.
And get back the crown, come on.
Boys.
Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs chasing their tails, and think for a moment.
Oh, please there's no need for that.
Well if that's all you desire, then be on your way.
I was going to offer you something worth one thousand crowns, would have made you rich beyond belief.
And that wasn't even the best part.
Oh well, C'est la vie.
Enjoy  your crown.
What's the best part?
It comes with revenge on Flynn Ryder.
So you're being strangely cryptic as  you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.
Sorry.
Just don't, don't freak out.
*Flower gleam and glow*
*Let your powers shine*
*Make the clock reverse*
*Bring back what once was mine.*
*Heal what has been hurt.*
*Change the fates design.*
*Save what has been lost.*
*Bring back what once was mine.*
*What once was mine.*
-Ah...
-Please don't freak out.
Ahhh. I'm not freaking out, are you freaking out?
No, I'm just very interested in your hair. and the magical qualities that it possesses.
How long has it been doing that, exactly?
Forever, I guess.
Mother said when I was a baby people tried to cut it.
They wanted to take it for themselves.
But, once it's cut.
It turns brown, and looses its power.
A gift like that, it has to be protected.
That's why Mother never let me...
That's why...I never left the...
You never left that tower.
And you're still gonna go back?
No...yes.
It's complicated.
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's a little bit of a...
It's a little bit of a downer.
There was this book.
A book I used to read every night to all the younger kids.
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive.
Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing to ever brag about, of course.
Was he a thief too?
Ahh, well no.
Actually, he had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do.
He could go anywhere that he wanted to go.
And...and, for a kid, with nothing.
I don't know, I...
It just seemed like a better option.
You can't tell anyone, about this, okay?
It could ruin my whole reputation.
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.
Oh, the thing about a reputation, it's all that a man has.
Um, well I should uh...
I, I should get some more firewood.
Hey.
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than, Flynn Ryder.
Well, then you'd be the first.
But, thank you.
Well, I thought he'd never leave.
Mother?
Hello, dear.
But I...I..., don't we...
How did you find me?
Oh, it was easy really.
I just listened for the sound of complete and utter betrayal, and followed that.
-Mother...
-We're going home, Rapunzel.
-Now.
-You...You don't understand.
I've been on this incredible journey.
And I've seen and learned so much.
I even met someone.
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.
-Come on, Rapunzel.
-Mother, wait.
I think
I think he likes me.
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel, that's demented.
-But mother, I...
-This is why you never should have left.
Dear this whole romance that you've invented, just proves you're to naive to be here.
Why would he like you?
Oh come on now, really.
Look at you, you think that he's impressed?
Don't be a dummy, come with mommy.
*Mother...*
-NO!
-No?
Oh.
I see how it is.
*Rapunzel, knows best.*
*Rapunzel's so mature, now.*
*Such a clever grown up, miss.*
*Rapunzel knows best.*
*Fine, if you're so sure now.*
*Go ahead then give him, THIS!*
How did you?
*This is why he's here.*
*Don't let him deceive you.*
*Give it to him, watch, you'll see.*
-I will.
*Trust me my dear, that's how fast he'll leave you.*
*I won't say I told you so...no.*
*Rapunzel knows best.*
*So if he's such a dream boat.*
*Go and put him, to the test.*
-Mother, wait.
*If he's lying, don't come crying.*
*Mother, knows best.*
So, hey uh, can I ask you something?
Is there any chance that I'm going to get super strength in my hand?
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.
Hey, you all right?
Oh, sorry, yes.
Just um, lost in thought,
I guess.
I mean because here's the thing.
Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.
Born with it, but superhuman strength?
Can you imagine the possibilities, I'm just...
Patience boys. All good things to those who wait.
Hmm, what?
Well I hope you're here to apologize.
AAAAAAAH!
No, no put me down.
Stop it. Let...me...go!
-Give me, him.
-OW!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy boy, easy, calm down.
Easy boy.
Easy.
That's it.
Now sit.
-Sit.
-What?
Now drop the boot.
Drop it.
Oh, you are such a good boy.
Yes you are.
You all tired, from chasing the bad man all over the place?
Flynn: Excuse me?
Nobody appreciates you, do they?
Do they?
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.
Isn't that right?
Maximus.
You've got to be kidding me.
Look, today is kinda the biggest day of my life.
And the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.
Just for twenty four hours and then, you can chase each other to your hearts content.
Okay?
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.
OOMPH!!
(Mouths) WOW
Ahh!
Sorry.
Thank you.
It's for the lost Princess.
To the boats
Hey, Max.
What? I brought them.
Most of them.
Where are we going?
Well, best day of your life.
I figured you should have a decent seat.
You okay?
I'm terrified.
Why?
I've been looking out the window for eighteen years.
Dreaming about what it would feel like when those lights rise in the sky.
What if it's not everything that I dreamed it would be?
It will be.
And what if it is?
What will I do then?
Well that's the good part,
I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.
*Solemn Music*
(Rapunzel sings, "I see the Light")
*All those days
Watching from the windows.*
*All those years
Outside looking in*
*All that time
Never even knowing*
*Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here*
*Blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here*
*Suddenly I see
Standing here*
*It's oh, so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be*
*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted*
*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new*
*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*
*All at once
Everything looks different*
*Now that I see you*
I have something for you, too.
I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared.
And the thing is,
I'm not scared anymore.
You know what I mean?
I'm starting to.
*All those days
Chasing down a daydream*
*All those years
Living in a blur*
*All that time
Never truly seeing*
*Things, the way they were
Now she's here*
*Shining in the starlight
Now she's here*
*Suddenly I know
If she's here*
*It's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go*
*And at last, I see the light*
*And it's like the fog has lifted*
*And at last, I see the light*
*And it's like the sky is new*
*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*
*All at once
Everything is different*
*Now that I, see you.*
*Now that I...see you.*
Is everything okay?
Huh? Oh yes.
Uh, yes of course.
I just...
I'm sorry, everything is fine.
There's just something I have to take care of.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
It's all right, Pascal.
Ahh, there you are.
I've been searching everywhere for you guys. Since we got separated.
Hey the sideburns are coming in nice, huh?
You gotta be excited about that.
Anyhow, just wanted to say,
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.
I'll miss you, but I think its for the... best.
Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?
-What?
-We heard you found something.
Something much more valuable than a crown.
We want her, instead.
I was starting to think you ran off with the crown and left me.
He did.
What?
No.
He wouldn't.
See for yourself.
Eugene?
Eugene!
Fair trade.
A crown, for the girl with the magic hair.
How much do you think someone will pay to stay young and healthy forever?
No, please.
NO!
NO!
AHH!
Rapunzel!
Mother?
Oh, my precious girl.
Mother.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
-Mother, how did you?
-I was so worried about you dear.
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you.
All right, let's go, let's go before they come to.
You were right, mother.
You were right about everything.
I know darling.
I know.
Look!
The crown.
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Guys, guys.
Rapunzel!
Let's get this over with, Ryder.
Where are we going?
Oh...
There, it never happened.
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazel nut soup.
I really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you, what was out there.
The world is dark, and selfish, and cruel.
If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine.
It destroys it.
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!
It wasn't us.
It was the old lady.
Old lady?
Wait, no, wait!
You don't understand, she's in trouble.
Wait!
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?
Are you all right?
I'm the lost princess.
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.
I am the lost Princess.
Aren't I?
Did I mumble, Mother?
Or should I even call you that?
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?
Why would you ask such a ridiculous question?
It was you!
It was all, you.
Everything I did, was to protect you.
-Rapunzel.
-I spent my entire life,
Hiding from people who would use me for my power.
-Rapunzel!
-And I should have been hiding.
From you.
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.
What did you do to him?
That criminal, is to be hanged for his crimes.
-No.
-Now, now. It's all right.
Listen to me.
All of this is as it should be.
NO!
You were wrong about the world.
And you were wrong about me.
And I will never let you use my hair, again!
You want me to be the bad guy?
Fine.
Now I'm the bad, guy.
What's this?
Open up.
What's the password?
-What?
-Nope.
Open this door.
Not even close.
You have three seconds
One...
Two...
Three...
Frying pans.
Who knew, right?
AAAAH!
-Head down?
-Head down.
-Arms in?
-Arms in.
-Knees apart?
-Knees apart.
Knees apart?
Why do I need to keep my knees apar...
AAAAAAAAH!
Max.
You brought them here?
Thank you.
No really, thank you.
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time we've just misunderstanding one another.
And we're really just, yeah your right. We should go.
Max.
Max!
WHOAAAAA!
Okay Max, lets see how fast you can run.
Rapunzel.
Rapunzel, let down your hair.
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never see you again.
Now look what you've done,
Rapunzel.
Oh don't worry, dear.
Our secret will die with him.
And as for us?
We are going where no one will ever find you, again.
Rapunzel, really.
Enough all ready.
Stop fighting me.
NO! I won't stop.
For every minute of the rest of my life I will fight.
I will never stop trying to get away from you.
But, if you let me save him...
I will go with you.
No. No, Rapunzel.
I'll never run, I'll never try to escape.
Just let me heal him. And you and I will be together.
Forever, just like you want.
Everything will be the way it was.
I promise.
Just like you want.
Just...let me...heal him.
In case you get any ideas about following us.
Eu..Eugene!
Ah, AHHH!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Everything is going to okay, though.
-No, Rapunzel!
-I promise, you have to trust me.
-No..
-Come on.
-I can't let you do this.
And I can't let you die.
-But if you do this.
-Shhh.
-Then you...will die.
-Hey.
It's gonna be all right.
Rapunzel, wait...
Eugene, what...?
NOOO!
No...NO!
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
No, no, no,
NOOO!
No, no, no, noooo.
NO!
Noooooooooo!
No, no, no, no, Eugene.
Oh, look at me, look me,
I'm right here.
Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.
*Flower gleam and glow,
Let your powers shine*
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*
-Rapunzel...
-What?
You were my new dream.
And you were mine.
*Heal what has been hurt.*
*Change the fates design.*
*Save what has been lost.*
*Bring back what once was mine.*
What once was mine.
Rapunzel?
Eugene.
Did I ever tell you, I've got a thing for brunettes?
(Eugene narrates)
Well, you could imagine what happened next.
The kingdom rejoiced.
For the lost Princess had returned.
The party lasted an entire week.
And, honestly I don't remember much of it.
Dreams came true all over the place.
That guy went on to become the most famous concert pianist in the world, if you can believe it.
And this guy? Well he eventually found true love.
As for this guy, well,
I assume he's happy.
He's never told me otherwise.
Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom disappeared almost over night.
As did most of the apples.
Pascal? 
Never changed.
At last Rapunzel was home,
and she finally had a real family.
She was a Princess worth waiting for.
Beloved by all, she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom that her parents did before her.
And as for me, well.
I started going by Eugene again.
Stopped thieving, and basically turned it all around.
But I know what the big question is.
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?
Well I'm pleased to tell you.
That after years, and years of asking,
and asking, and asking.
I finally said yes.
*Eugene*
All right, I asked her.
And we're living happily ever after.
Yes, we are.
A legend is sung
Of when England was young
And knights were brave and bold
The good king had died
And no one could decide
Who was rightful heir to the throne
It seemed that the land
Would be torn by war
Or saved by a miracle alone
And that miracle appeared
In London town
The sword
In the stone
And below the hilt in letters of gold... were written these words:
"Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil... is rightwise king born of England."
Though many tried for the sword with all their strength... none could move the sword nor stir it.
So the miracle had not worked.
And England was still without a king.
And in time, the marvellous sword was forgotten.
This was a dark age... without law and without order.
Men lived in fear of one another... for the strong preyed upon the weak.
A dark age indeed!
Age of inconvenience.
No plumbing... no electricity... no nothing!
Oh, hang it all!
Hang it all!
Oh, now what?
Now what?
Leave, leave off!
Leave off!
Oh, you, you, you fiendish chain you!
Everything complicated.
One big medieval mess.
Now, uh, let me see.
He should be here in,
I'd say half an hour.
Who? Who? I'd like to know who.
I told you, Archimedes.
I am not sure.
All I know is that someone will be coming. Someone very important.
Oh, pig feathers!
Fate will direct him to me so that I, in turn... may guide him to his rightful place in the world.
Huh! And-And you say he will arrive in half an hour?
Ha! Well, we'll just see.
And you will, Archimedes.
You will.
Ow!
He'll be, uh, a boy.
Small boy.
Eleven, 12 years old.
And a scrawny little fellow.
Oh, no, no.
That can't be the one.
Surely not. Why, that big lad must be close onto 20.
Ah. There he is.
The scrawny little fellow about 12.
He's a regular little grasshopper.
Look at him go.
And where-- where would you guess he is at this very moment?
I am not guessing,
Archimedes!
I know where he is!
Less than a mile from here just beyond the forest.
And right on schedule, if-if all goes well.
- Quiet, Wart.
- I'm tryin' to be.
And nobody asked you to come along in the first place.
- I'm not even movin'.
- Shut up.
Aha! Here we go.
Oh, what a set-up.
Right smack through the old gizzard.
Whoa. What? Oh!
Why, you clumsy, little fool!
Oh, Kay, please, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it. Please.
If I ever--
If I ever get my hands on, on you, I'll, I'll ring... your scrawny little neck, so help me, I will.
I'll get the arrow, Kay.
I'm sure I can find it.
Don't tell me you're going in there.
Why, it's swarming with wolves.
I'm not afraid.
Well, go ahead.
It's your skin, not mine.
Go on, go on.
There it is.
Oh, there it is.
Whoa! What-- Oh!
Well.
So, you, you did drop in for tea after all.
Oh, you are a bit late, you know.
- Oh, l, I am?
- Yes.
Now, my name is Merlin.
Come, come, who are you, my lad?
Oh, my name's Arthur, but everyone calls me Wart.
Oh.
Oh, what a perfect stuffed owl.
Stuff--
I, l, I beg your pardon!
He's alive and he talks.
And certainly a great deal better than you do.
Oh, come, Archimedes.
Come, come now.
I, I want you to meet the Wart.
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.
Boy? Boy?
Well, I see no boy.
- Oh, I'm sorry that l--
- That's all right.
He's much too sensitive.
Sensitive? Huh?
Who? What? What?
- Oh, well.
- How did you know that I was--
Oh, th-that you would be dropping in?
Well, I happen to be a wizard. A soothsayer.
A prognosticator. I have the power to see into the future.
Centuries into the future!
I, I've even been there, lad.
And I've seen all these things.
They're, they're only plans and small models, of course, you know.
Now, this for instance is a steam locomotive.
There she goes.
Pretty good, eh?
Now, that won't be invented for hundreds of years!
Oh. You mean you can see everything before it happens?
Yes, everything.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Everything, Merlin?
Uh-- No, no, not everything.
I, uh, I admit I didn't know whom to expect for tea.
But as you can see...
I've figured the exact place.
You're very clever, sir.
Yes. Well, never mind the, the, the sir.
Just, uh, plain Merlin will do.
Now, would, would you care for sugar?
Oh, yes I would, please.
All right. Sugar. Sugar?
No, no, manners, manners, manners!
Guests first, you know that!
All right.
Say when, lad.
When!
- Have you had any schooling?
- Oh, yes!
I'm training to be a squire. I'm learning the rules of combat and swordsmanship and... and jousting and horsemanship.
Oh, yes, yes, very good.
That's, that's--
No, no, no, l--
I mean a, a, a real education.
Mathematics. History.
Biology. Natural science.
English. Latin. French.
No. When! When!
Blast it all! When!
Impudent piece of crockery.
Boy, now, you can't--
You can't grow up without a decent education, you know.
Oh, I suppose not, sir--
Merlin.
So, I am going to be your tutor.
But I've got to get back to the castle.
They'll want me in the kitchen.
Oh, well.
Then very well.
We'll pack and be on our way.
You-- You watch now.
You'll like this.
Higitus figitus zumba ka zing.
I want your attention, everything.
We're packing to leave.
Come on. Let's go.
No, no, not you. Books are always first, you know.
Hockety pockety wockety whack
Abra abra dabra nack
Shrink in size very small
We've got to save enough room for all
Higitus figitus migitus mum
Prestidigitonium
Alika fez, balika zez
Malaca mez meripedes
Hockety pockety wockety--
Whoa!
Now, stop, stop, stop, stop!
See here, sugar bowl. You're getting rough.
That poor old tea set is cracked enough.
Now. Now, all right.
Let's start again.
Ah, let's start-- Eh--
Oh. Where was l, boy?
- Uh, hock-hockety pockety?
- Oh, yes, yes, that's right.
Hockety pockety wockety wack
Odds and ends and bric-a-brac
Be with you in just a minute, son. Packing's almost done.
You, you, you bungling blockhead!
Hey, easy there.
No, no, go ahead.
Dum doodly doodly doodly dum
This is the best part now.
Higitus figitus migitus mum
Prestidigitonium
Higitus figitus migitus mum
Prestidigitoni--
- Ha, ha!
- What a way to pack.
Well-- Well, now, just a minute, boy.
How else would you get all this stuff into one suitcase, I'd like to know?
- Oh, but I think it's wonderful!
- Oh.
Yes, it is rather.
Now, well... don't, don't you get any foolish ideas that magic will solve all your problems.
- Because it won't!
- But, sir, I don't have any problems.
Oh, bah, everybody's got problems.
The world is full of problems.
Oh, blast it all!
There, now. You see what I mean?
See, that's the trouble with the world today.
Everybody butting their heads against a brick wall. All muscle and no mentality.
Do you want to be all muscle and no brain?
- I don't have any muscle.
- You don't? Well, how do you move about?
Oh, I suppose l,
I do have a little.
Aha. There, you see. Well, that's enough. Now, develop your brain.
Knowledge, wisdom. There's the real power. Higher learning.
That's the thing.
So, first thing tomorrow morning, we'll start a full schedule.
Eight hours a day. We'll have six hours for schoolroom and two for study period.
But l-- I don't have the time.
I have page duties.
Uh, page duties? Ha!
Ah, well, we'll change all that.
There's got to be a shake-up.
Well, yes, sir.
I, I suppose so.
How do you ever expect to amount to anything without an education, I'd like to know?
Even in these bungling, backward, medieval times... you have got to know where you're going, don't you?
Ye-- Yes, sir.
Yes, of course. So, you must plan for the future, boy.
You've got to find a direction.
And you've--
Now, by the by, what direction is this castle of yours?
I think it's north.
The other way.
Oh, oh.
All right, then we better get a move on. Come on, come on, lad. Pick up the pace. Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Yo-ho, the devil take it!
No, the devil take it.
Anyone's got better sense than to go barging off in that infernal forest alone.
You had no business letting him go.
Look, Dad, I'm not the Wart's keeper.
Well, blast it all, I am.
After all, l, I took him in, adopted the lad, you might say.
Being his foster father, well, I'm responsible.
Whoop.
Tiger! Talbot! Off with you.
Now, look here, Wart.
What's the big idea of gallivanting off in the woods... and worrying the living daylights out of everybody?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Well, sorry's not enough.
That's four demerits.
Four hours extra kitchen duty.
Eh, report to the cook!
- But, sir, I'd like you to meet--
- Go on, hop it, boy, hop, hop, hop it!
Well, yes, you've got to keep a tight schedule to run a big place like this.
Need strict rules.
Especially for small boys.
And I most certainly agree.
Who are you and--
Oh. I mean, uh, you?
Uh, my name is Merlin.
Uh, this is Archimedes.
A highly educated owl.
Educated owl?
Say, that's a good one.
Say. Hey, I know.
You've got him under a spell,
Marvin. You're a magician.
The name is Merlin.
And I happen to be the world's most powerful wizard.
Come off it, man.
Gadzooks!
All right.
I shall demonstrate.
Higitus figitus migitus moe... wind and snow swirl and blow!
What the devil are you up to?
And that is what I call a "wizard blizzard."
Hey, Kay, would you look at this?
An indoor blizzard.
And in the month of July.
So what?
All right, Marvin. Turn her off.
I'm convinced.
Alakazam!
I, uh-- I hope you don't go in for any of that black magic.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Never touch the stuff. No.
My magic is used mainly for educational purposes.
In fact, that is why
I am here.
I have come to educate the Wart.
Oh, no you don't.
I'm running this place. And if you think you're gonna fiddle with my schedule... you'd better pack up your bag of tricks and be gone.
Wha-- Well, by Jove.
Hey, he's gone.
Hm-mmm. Good riddance.
I'm gone, but then,
I'm not gone.
So, if I do leave... you could never be sure that I am gone, can you?
Well, uh--
Well, I must say, you-- you got me there, Marvin.
Yes. Well, you win. You're welcome to stay if you like.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Very generous, I must say.
Well, uh, all we can offer is room and board.
Hard times, you know, Marvin.
We'll put you up in the northwest tower.
That's the guest room.
It's a bit drafty in the winter... but in this blazing hot weather, it's the best room in the house.
Oh, yes.
Very lovely indeed.
So just make yourself at home, Marvin.
Marvin, Marvin,
Marvin, Marvin.
Best room in the house!
Guest room!
Unwelcome-guest room!
But if he thinks that he can get rid of me, I've got news for that old walrus.
- I'm sticking it out.
- And I say we go back to the woods.
No, not on your life.
That boy's got to have an education.
He has a future.
Well, you may be right.
A skinny kid like that would make a cracking good chimney sweep.
Something tells me that you're all wet, Archimedes.
- Who goes there?
- Pelinore!
It's Pelinore, dash it all!
I've got big news from London.
Big news!
Come on, man.
Drop the bridge.
Oh, big news, eh?
They can't wait for the London Times. First edition won't be out for at least, uh...
1200 years.
Archimedes, would you mind sailing down there and, and--
Not interested!
Oh, come, come, come, come now.
You're as wet as you can get.
No! No, no, no!
Archimedes! I'll turn you into a human.
- Hmph! You wouldn't dare!
- I will. So help me, I will.
Well, all right, all right.
All right!
All right.
It works every time.
Just like magic.
Pelinore!
Pelinore.
Greetings, old boy. And what's all the noise about London, hmm?
Big news. Really big news.
Sit down, man, and let's hear all about it.
They're having a big tournament
New Year's Day.
Oh, that's not news, dash it all. They always do.
Yeah, but, Ector-- Ector, here's where all the excitement comes in.
To the winner of this tournament goes the crown.
You mean-- You mean he'll be King of all England?
King of all England.
- Kay, lad, did you hear that?
- Pretty fair prize, I'd say.
Yes, and you can win it, boy, if you knuckle down to your training.
And we'll have you knighted by Christmas and off to London. What do you say?
Sure. Why not? Why not?
Wart, lad, how'd you like to go to London?
- Oh, Sir Ector, you mean it?
- If you stick to your duties, you can be Kay's squire.
Oh, I will, sir.
I will.
I don't want the Wart for my squire.
Here's to London!
And to here's to Kay.
And here's to the banner of the Castle of the Forest Suavage.
- Cheers!
- Cheers, cheers. - Cheers.
Charge!
Weight forward!
Lean into him!
Steady, boy. Steady!
Steady with the lance!
Grip her tight!
Hit him clean!
No, no, no!
Heads up!
Ar-Ar-Archimedes. Archimedes, wh-where, where, where are we?
In a tumble-down old tower... in the most miserable old castle in all Christendom, that's where.
C-Castle? Castle?
Don't you even remember the boy?
Uh, the boy?
Can't you remember one blasted thing?
- Oh, now, just a moment. I--
- Tight grip on the lance.
- Oh.
- Loosen the saddle, knees in tight.
Weight forward and stay on target.
You keep losing your grip.
It's not a mere matter of muscle, sir.
Jousting is, uh, uh, a fine skill.
It-- It's a highly developed science.
Science, indeed.
One dummy trying to knock off another dummy with a bit of a stick.
And the Wart's just as hot for it as the rest of them.
He certainly is. That boy's got real spark. Lots of spirit.
Throws himself heart and soul into everything he does.
That's really worth something if it can only be turned in the right direction.
Ha-ha.
Fat chance of that.
Oh, I plan to cheat, of course.
Use magic. Every last trick in the trade if I have to.
I'd give anything to go riding about on a great white charger... slaying dragons and griffins and man-eating giants.
Well, won't you?
Oh. No. You see.
I'm an orphan, and a knight must be of proper birth.
I only hope I'm worthy to be Kay's squire.
That's a big job too, you know.
Oh, indeed, yes, yes.
I would say almost impossible. Yes.
Well, now then. When I said that I could swim like a fish...
I really meant as a fish.
You mean you can turn yourself into a fish?
After all, I happen to be a wizard.
- Could you turn me into a fish?
- Well, do you have any imagination?
Can you imagine yourself as a fish?
Oh, that's easy.
I've done that lots of times.
Oh. Well, good. Then I think that my magic can do the rest.
Archimedes, what, what is that fish formula?
- Who? Who? What? What? What?
- You know, that, that, that Latin business.
Hmm? Fish? Latin?
Oh, uh.
Aquarius aquaticus aqualitus.
And-And now if you don't mind...
I say good day to the both of you if you please.
When he stays out all night... he's always grumpy the next morning.
- Then he must stay out every night.
- Yes.
Oh. Oh, yes. Oh, I say, that's very good, boy. Very.
Who? What? What?
All right, boy. All set.
Here we go.
Aquarius aquaticus aqualitus quum.
Aqua digi tarium.
Merlin, am I a fish?
Am I a fish?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, you are a fish... but if you don't stop that flippity-flopping around... and get in the water, you won't last long.
Now, now, stay right here in the tules and I'll-- I'll be with you in a minute.
Oh.
So you thought you could take right off like a shot, did you?
Well, I am a fish, aren't l?
You merely look like a fish.
That doesn't mean that you can swim like one. You, you don't have the instinct.
So, you'll have to use your, your brain for a change.
You are living between two planes now.
Somewhere between the ceiling and the floor.
Now, there, there's lots of ups and downs...
Like-like, uh, like a helicopter.
- Helicopter?
- Yes--
Oh. No, never mind.
Every flick of a fin creates movement.
So, first we'll start with a caudal fin.
No, no, boy.
Your tail. Tail.
Now, now, that gives you the forward thrust now.
Come on, let's get a rhythm.
Right, left.
Right, left. One, two.
Left and right
Like day and night
That's what makes the world go 'round
In and out
Thin and stout
That's what makes the world go 'round
For every up there is a down
- For every square
- There is a round?
Yes.
For every high
- There is a low?
- Uh-huh.
- And for every to
-- - There is a-- - Fro. - Fro.
Yes, fro.
To and fro, Stop and go
That's what makes the world go 'round
In and out
Thin and stout
- Merlin! Merlin!
- Oh!
- I swallowed a bug!
- Oh. What's wrong with that?
After all, ah, boy, you are a fish. I-instinct, you know.
- But you said I had no instinct.
- Yes, of--
Oh. Oh, I did. Well, th-that's neither here nor there.
But the main thing is you must--
Set your sights upon the heights
Don't be a mediocrity
- Mediocrity?
- That's right.
Don't just wait and trust to fate
And say that's how it's meant to be
It's up to you how far you go
If you don't try you'll never know
And so, my lad as I've explained
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Let's, let's swim through that tall grass again. It tickles.
Oh. Oh,
I beg your pardon.
Me too.
For every to there is a fro
For every stop there is a go
And that's what makes the world go 'round
Oh, let go, let go, let go!
Oh, you big, bug-eyed bully, you!
Who, me?
Oh, here, here, here, here, here, now, boy.
There's no sense in going around insulting bullfrogs.
A fish has plenty of other problems without that.
The water world has its forests and its jungles too.
So it has its tigers and its wolves. And that, eh, ah--
That's what makes the world go 'round
You see, my boy it's nature's way
Upon the weak the strong ones prey
The human life it's also true
The strong will try to conquer you
And that is what you must expect
Unless you use your intellect
Brains and brawn
Weak and strong
- Help, Merlin! Help! Help!
- That's what makes the wor--
Jehoshaphat!
Oh!
- Quick, Merlin, the magic!
- No, no.
You're on your own, lad.
Now's your chance to prove my point.
Wha-What point?
He's the brawn and you're the brain.
Oh, now, don't, don't, don't panic!
You use your head.
Outsmart the big brute.
Smart move, lad!
That's using the old intellect.
- Bravo, boy! Great strategy!
- Is the lesson about over?
D-D-Did you get the point?
Yes, yes, brain over brawn.
Okay, lad, I'll fix the big brute. Higgeldy piggeldy--
No, no. Hocus pocus--
Now, what in blaze-- Eh--
Merlin!
Now what? Oh, it's, it's that, that boy!
- Wh-Wh-What in b-blazes!
- Help! Help! Help!
Ouch!
Help!
Archimedes!
Help!
What in thunder is a monster like that doing in the moat?
By George, l-l-l-- I'll, I'll--
I'll turn him into a minnow.
- Merlin!
- Oh! Oh, there you are, boy.
Snick snack snorum!
How in the world did you ever get out of that mess?
That, that big fish almost swallowed me and, and Archimedes, he, he saved me.
Well, by George.
Oh, what do you know about that?
I did nothing of the sort!
I intended to eat him.
Young perch is my favourite dish.
You know that!
Oh.
- Do you believe that, Wart?
- Well, l--
Wart. Wart!
I've gotta go. Thank you,
Merlin. It was so much fun.
- And, Archimedes, l, l--
- Pinfeathers, boy!
Wart! Where are you, Wart?
Coming!
I'm coming.
Now, Archimedes.
Why would you half-drown yourself for a tidbit of fish?
And after such a big breakfast?
Pinfeathers and gully fluff!
We were doing fine until we got in deep water.
Then along comes this huge pike with big jaws and sharp, jagged teeth.
Oh, turn him off, Dad.
He was a monster!
The biggest fish I ever saw.
- And, boy, that's the biggest fish story I ever heard.
- But it's true, sir.
That's three demerits for being late and three more for the fish story.
Now, hop into the kitchen!
I told you the Wart was loony.
Yes, well, he's either out of his head or, uh.... there's something mighty fishy going on around here.
For every high there is a low
For every to there is a fro
To and fro
Stop and go
That's what makes the world go round
- Oh, it's you, Merlin, sir.
- Uh, yes, my lad.
Now, have you ever considered being a squirrel?
Well, no, I don't suppose.
Well, now, there is a tiny creature... with enormous problems.
How he has survived throughout the ages... is one of nature's big mysteries.
His life is hazardous.
Downright dangerous.
Uh, would you like to try it?
- Oh, no, I'd better not.
- Oh-ho.
It's, uh, too dangerous for you, eh?
Oh, no, it's not that.
It's just that I've got six demerits. All this work to do.
What a mess!
What a medieval muddle.
We'll have to modernize it.
Start an assembly-line system.
All right now. One and a-two and a-three and a-four!
Higitus figitus migitus mum
Skitun de bitun de batun de dum
- But I'm supposed to do it.
- No one will know the difference, son.
Who cares as long as the work gets done?
Rubbedy scrubbedy
Sweepety flow
Come on, son.
Let's go, let's go.
Wart. Wart!
Wart. Now, take it easy.
Take it easy, boy.
What? Oh, no, boy!
No, no!
- Wart!
- Whoa. Oh!
Now, what did I tell you?
Always look before you leap.
Well, I made it, didn't I?
Yes, yes, you made it. You made it, but you, you can't always trust to luck, boy.
Now, first thing... you start with the short jumps.
Gauge the distance carefully.
And-- Oh!
Now, there, you see?
Even, even, even then you can miss.
So, don't take gravity too lightly or it'll catch up with you.
- What's gravity?
- Gravity is what causes you to fall.
Oh, like a stumble or, or a trip?
Yes, it's like a stumble or a
-- No, no, no, no, no. It's the force that pulls you downward.
The, the phenomenon that any two material particles or bodies... if free to move, will be accelerated toward each other.
- Merlin, how will we get by?
- Hmm?
Oh. Oh, well, l, I suppose we better go back to a side track.
Go on, go on.
You got lots of room.
Well, l-- I, l, I guess she can't be sidetracked.
That's a girl squirrel, that, and a redhead at that.
- She sure acts funny.
- Well, she likes you.
Why?
Yes, well, well, well, that's nature again.
But I'm afraid there's no time to explain.
Here, here, now.
You better leave me out of it.
Yeah, me too.
Merlin! Merlin!
You're on your own, lad. I'm afraid magic can't solve this problem.
Look, I'm, I'm not a boy.
I mean--
I'm not a squirrel.
I'm a boy.
A human boy.
Not a real sq--
Oh, leave me alone!
Merlin, what'll I do?
She won't leave me--
Well, I'm, I'm afraid you're stuck, lad.
Well, when a girl squirrel chooses a mate, it's for life.
- But I won't be a squirrel tomorrow.
- But she doesn't know that.
She only knows one simple fact.
That you're a him and she's a her.
- That's a natural phenomenon.
- Phenomenon-menum?
Well, it's the, the, uh--
It's a state of being
A frame of mind
It's a most befuddling thing
And to every being of every kind it is discombooberating
You're wasting time resisting
You'll find the more you do
The more she'll keep insisting
Her him has got to be you
Now leave me alone!
I mean it!
It's a rough game
Anyone knows
Go away!
There are no rules
Anything goes
There's no logical explanation
For this discombooberation
It's a most bemuddling
Most befuddling thing
Oh! Who? Who? What-- What--
Now, go on. Shoo!
Get a tree of your own.
Skedaddle!
You-- You-- You-- You--
Oh, you squirrelly squirrels!
She's gaining on you, Wart.
There's no sensible explanation
For this discombooberation
It's a most hodge-podgical
Most illogical
Most confusiling
Most bamboozling
Most bemuddling
Most be-befu-fuddling
Thing
Really, now, Miss, uh--
Madam. I, uh--
You, you, you've made a mistake.
Now, now, now, please.
Please, you--
Oh! Madam! Madam!
Now, look here.
I am not a boy.
I, I mean, I'm--
I'm not a squirrel. I'm a b--
No, that's not what-- No!
No. I'm, I'm,
I'm a stupid old--
No!
I'm an old man.
An old human.
Understand?
Oh, hang it all.
Now, go away.
Shoo, shoo.
Impossible. Impossible!
Ooh, confound it!
Confound it all!
Merlin, I'm tired of being a squirrel.
It's nothing but trouble.
Oh, you've got trouble?
Look at my-- Look back there!
One side, lad.
Whoa, what--
Help, Merlin!
Help!
Oh, no!
By George!
I've had enough of this nonsense!
Alakazam!
There. You see? I'm an ugly, horrible, grouchy old man!
- Merlin!
- Oh.
- So, here we are.
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.
Snick snack snorum.
There. Now you see?
I'm not a squirrel. I'm a boy.
I tried to tell you.
I'm a boy.
A human boy.
Oh, if you could only understand.
Ah, you know, lad... that love business is a powerful thing.
Greater than gravity?
Well, yes, boy, in its way, I'd, uh--
Yes, I'd say it's the greatest force on Earth.
Oh, Ector!
Ector! Sir Ector! The kitchen!
- Hold it, son! Hold it.
- Black magic all over the place!
Kay! Hold on, I say!
Stop!
Oh. Now, what's all the commotion, hmm?
Oh, the kitchen, it's under an evil spell!
- Huh?
- It's bewitched.
Oh, I bet it's that old goat Marvin.
Come on, son.
I-l knew he'd give us trouble.
Gadzooks!
Black magic of the worst kind!
Come on, Kay!
To the attack!
Wha-- Oh!
Hold it!
Heaven preserve us!
Kay!
- Now, what have we here?
- Jumpin' hoptoads!
Alakazam!
So there you are, you old goat.
Well, what's the idea of flinging your evil spells all over the place?
Oh, oh, lend me a hand, boy.
Well, what have you got to say for yourself, hmm?
You call washing dishes and sweeping floors a work of evil?
I'll decide what's right and wrong around here.
Besides, that's the Wart's job.
One of his duties.
Uh, and look here, boy.
If you want to make that trip to London, you'd better tow the mark.
You old goat! lf I ever catch you in my kitchen again, I'll--
Madam, you won't.
Oh, dear. He's gone.
Well, by Jove.
We ought to run the old geezer right out of the castle.
Oh, no, no, no, no, Kay. No.
He might cast an evil spell on the lot of us.
Turn us all to stone.
No. There's no telling what the old devil might do.
He's not an old devil!
He-- He's good!
And, and his magic is good too.
If, if you'd just leave him alone!
Now, look here, Wart.
That's three more demerits.
- Box his ears, Dad.
- Just because you can't understand something...
- it, it doesn't mean it's wrong.
- Ten more demerits!
You make all the rules and, and nobody else can say anything.
You said a plenty, boy! All that popping off just cooked your goose.
Kay, from now on, young Hobbs is your squire.
Did you hear that, Wart?
Hobbs is going to be Kay's squire.
- Ye
-- Ye-- Yes, sir. - Now that'll teach you to pop off, you little pipsqueak.
Oh, I'm sorry, lad.
I'm sorry.
I spoiled everything.
I know that trip to London means a great deal to you.
Oh, it's, it's not your fault.
I shouldn't have popped off.
Now I'm really done for.
No, no, you're in a great spot, boy.
You can't go down now.
It can only be up from here.
- I'd like to know how.
- Use your head.
An education, lad.
What good will that do?
Get it first. Then who knows?
Are you willing to try?
Well, what have
I got to lose?
That's the spirit!
We'll start tomorrow!
We'll show 'em.
Won't we, boy?
We sure will.
Now, first of all, lad... we've got to get all these medieval ideas out of your head.
Clear the way for new ideas.
Knowledge of man's fabulous discoveries... in the centuries ahead.
- Now that'll be a great advantage, boy.
- Advantage, indeed!
If the boy goes about saying the world is round, they'll take him for a lunatic.
- The world is round?
- Yes, yes, that's right.
And it also goes around.
- You mean it'll be round someday?
- No, no, no.
It's round now. Man will discover this in centuries to come.
And he will also find that the world is merely... a tiny speck in the universe.
- Universe?
- Oh, you're only confusing the boy.
Before you're through, he'll be so mixed up, he'll, he'll be wearing his shoes on his head.
Man has always learned from the past. After all, you can't learn history in reverse.
It's, it's, it's confusing enough, for heaven sakes.
All right! All right.
Have it your way, Archimedes.
You're in charge.
You're the headmaster now.
So from now on, he's your pupil.
So, from now on, boy... you do as I say.
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
Now to start off, I want you to read these books.
- All of them?
- That, my boy, is a mountain of knowledge.
- But l, but I can't read.
- What, what? What? Then I don't suppose you know how to write?
- No, sir.
- What do you know?
- Well, l--
- Well, never mind. Never mind.
We'll start at the bottom.
The ABC's.
First the A, and now the B.
Loop and around and there's the C.
Merlin. Look.
I can write.
Oh. Yes, yes.
That's very good, boy. Very--
Henscratch, that's all.
Henscratch. Now, come on.
D, E, F, and now the G.
You see, it's as simple as--
No, no, no! No, boy!
Now, use your head. Use your head, will you?
How do you ever expect to learn anything?
Archimedes!
Have you seen that, uh... flying machine model?
I have nothing to do with your futuristic fiddle-faddle, you know that.
- What's that thing up there?
- Hmm? Oh, yes, of course.
- Here we are.
- You mean man will fly in one of those someday?
If man were meant to fly, he'd have been born with wings.
I am about to prove otherwise, Archimedes... if you care to watch.
Here she goes.
No, no, no, no, no--
Man'll fly all right.
Just like a rock.
It would have worked if, if, if, if it weren't for... this infernal beard!
I never, never in my whole--
Man will fly someday,
I tell you.
I have been there.
I have seen it.
Oh, I do hope so.
I've always dreamed about flying-- that I was a bird and that I could go sailing all over the sky high above everything.
Prestadigitonium.
It's my favourite dream.
Oh, but then I suppose everybody dreams about flying.
I'm a bird! I'm a bird!
I'm a bird!
Hold it, boy.
Not so fast. Not so fast.
First, l-- I'd better explain the mechanics of a bird's wing.
Now, these large feathers... are called the primaries.
- And, uh--
- And, uh, since when... do you know all about bird's wings?
I have made an extensive study of birds in flight. And l--
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.
All right, Mr Know-lt-All, he's your pupil.
- Ouch!
- Now, boy... flying is not merely some crude mechanical process.
It is a delicate art.
Purely aesthetic.
Poetry of motion.
And the best way to learn it is to do it.
Now, since we're pretty far up, we'll start with a glide.
Spread your wings way out, way out. That's it. That's it.
Now, fan your tail.
Tippity-toe, tippity-toe, and off we go.
Now, tuck your feet under, like me. That's it. That's the idea!
- Whoa! What? Oh!
- And don't fight the air currents.
Use them.
Well, say, boy!
That's pretty good.
Well, boy, you're a natural!
Are you sure this is the first time that you've--
Wart! Wart!
Hawk! Hawk!
Look out, boy!
Heads up! Wart!
Archimedes! Help!
Wart! Wart!
Whoa! What? Oh!
Sounds like someone's sick.
How lov--
Oh, bat gizzards.
It's nothing but... a scrawny little sparrow with a beak full of soot.
Oh, I-I'm not really a sparrow.
I'm a boy.
- A boy?
- Merlin changed me with his magic.
He's the world's most powerful wizard.
Merlin. Ho-ho!
Merlin, the world's most powerful bungler.
Why, boy, I've got more magic in one little finger.
Now, don't tell me you've never heard of the marvellous Madam Mim?
Well, no, I don't guess so.
Madam Mim? Oh! Good heavens, good heavens, good heavens!
My boy, I'm the greatest.
I'm truly marvellous!
With only a touch
I have the power
Zim zab rim bim
To whither a flower
I find delight in the gruesome and grim
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Thank you, my boy.
But that's nothing, nothing for me.
No! 'Cause I'm the magnificent... marvellous, mad Madam Mim.
You know what?
I can even change size.
I can be huge!
Ooh! Fill the whole house.
I can be teeny
Small as a mouse
Black sorcery is my dish of tea
Uh, it comes easy to me.
'Cause I'm the magnificent... marvellous, mad Madam Mim.
Marvellous, boy!
Marvellous, I'm marvellous!
Say, lad, did you know that
I can make myself uglier yet?
Well, that would be some trick.
Er, um, ah, I mean, uh--
Want to bet? Boo!
You see? I win, I win!
Aren't I hideous, boy?
Perfectly revolting?
- Well, uh, yes, ma'am.
- But you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Watch this.
I can be beautiful lovely and fair
Silvery voice long purple hair
But it's only skin deep for zim zaberim zim
I'm an ugly, old creep!
The magnificent, marvellous... mad, mad, mad, mad Madam Mim.
Now what do you think, boy?
Who's the greatest?
Well, uh, Merlin's magic is always, um, well, useful... uh, for something good.
- And he must see something good in you.
- Oh, I suppose so.
Yes, and in my book, that's bad!
So, my boy, I'm afraid
I'll have to destroy you.
De-Destroy me?
Yeah, I-I'll give you a sporting chance.
I'm mad about games, you know.
Yeah, well come on, get going, boy.
You gotta keep on your toes in this game.
I win, I win!
Oh, the game's over.
Why, you little devil, you! I'll wring your scrawny little neck!
Mim! Mim! Wha-Wha-What--
Eh, what was you up to?
Uh! Me-Me-- Oh, Merlin!
Well, you're just in time.
- We were playing a little game.
- She was gonna destroy me.
And just what are you gonna do about it?
Want to fight?
Want to have a wizard's duel?
- As you wish, madam.
- Well, come on, step outside.
After you, madam.
They're havin' a wizard's duel.
What's that mean?
Oh, it's a battle of wits.
The players change themselves... to different things and, and attempt to, uh, to destroy one another.
De-Des-De-Destroy?
But just watch, boy, just watch.
You'll get the idea.
Now, first of all, if you don't mind, I'll make the rules.
Rules indeed!
Why, she only wants rules so she can break 'em!
I'll take care of you later, featherbrain.
Now, rule one, no mineral or vegetable.
Only animal. Rule two, no make-believe things...
Like, uh, oh, pink dragons and stuff.
Now, rule three, no disappearing.
- Rule four, no cheating.
- All right, all right.
Now, pace off ten.
One, two, three, four--
- Merlin! She disappeared!
- Huh? Ah-- Duh-- Bah-- Mim!
Now, you made the rules!
Ouch!
- Change to somethin' else, Merlin.
- Ah-- Buh-- Y-Yes... yes, yes, yes, give me time to think.
- Ah, higgety-piggety. Ah, duh
-- No, no, no, no, no. - Quick, Merlin, hurry!
Ah-- Duh-- Hoppity-hip-hip.
Ha-ha!
Got me tail, now!
Madam, just a minute.
Ah-- D-D--
This is not the-the-the-the--
- Come on! Something bigger!
- Something smaller!
Mi-Mi-Mim, Mi-Mim,
Mi-Mim Mi-Mi--
Ooh!
Merlin! No disappearing.
Whoo!
Ouch!
Mim? Mim?
Are-Are-Are you--
Now-- Gah-- What-What--
W-W-What's going on here?
You, you-- You big blimp!
Squash me, will ya?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, Merlin!
- Ouch! Ooh!
- Bravo!
Oh, just you wait!
Just you wait! You're gonna pay!
So you want to play rough, do ya?
All right, Merlin. I'll smash you good, you old crab!
Jehoshaphat!
Here I come, Mim, ready or not.
Merlin, you wouldn't dare!
Now, now, Mim, Mim!
No-No dragons, remember?
Did I say no purple dragons?
Did l?
I win, I win!
Oh, that horrible old witch!
I'll, I'll peck her eyes out!
Huh, no, no.
No, no, no.
- He's gone!
- Disappeared.
Madam, I have not disappeared.
I am very tiny.
I'm a germ. A rare disease.
I'm called "malagolintomontorosis"... and you caught me, Mim!
What?
First, you break out into spots.
Followed by hot and cold flashes.
Then violent sneezing.
Huh! Watch it, boy!
Oh! Er-- You-You-You-You sneaky old scoundrel!
Oh, it's not too serious, madam.
Ah, you should recover... in a few weeks and be as good, uh--
Ah, heh-heh-- I-l mean as bad as ever.
But, ah, I would suggest plenty of rest... and lots and lots of sunshine!
I hate sunshine!
I hate horrible, wholesome sunshine!
I hate it, I hate it!
I hate, hate, hate, hate--
You were really great, Merlin, but-but you could've been killed.
It was worth it, lad, if you learned something from it.
Knowledge and wisdom is the real power.
Right you are, Wart, so stick to your schooling, boy.
Oh-Oh, don't worry, I will, sir.
I will, oh, I really will.
We will sing all night and all day we will fight
For the blue oak tree on the field of white
For the blue oak tree on the fie-ie-ie-ie-ield
Of white
Here's to victory in London for my son, Kay!
Sir Kay. I've been knighted, don't forget.
No-o, of course, son, of course.
Ah, here's to Sir Kay.
And who knows?
The future king of all England!
- Watch it, will ya?
- Kay the king?
What a dreadful thought.
Sir Ector! Sir Ector!
Hobbs has come down with the mumps!
Face all-all-all puffed up like a toad!
Then Kay'll need another squire, hang it all.
- Hmm. Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir?
Kay's squire.
You're going to London, boy.
Oh, Sir Ector!
Whoa! What? Whoa!
Merlin! Archimedes! Merlin!
Merlin, look!
I'm a squire!
Hah!
Oh. Uh, very nice, boy.
Yes, indeed. A fine monkey suit for polishing boots.
It's-it's what all the squires wear.
And I thought you were going to amount to something!
I thought you had a few brains!
Great future. Hah!
A stooge for that big lunk, Kay.
Congratulations, boy!
What do y-- What do you want me to be? I'm nobody.
You-- You don't know a thing about what's goin' on today.
I-I-I-I'm lucky to be Kay's squire.
D-- Oh! D--
Of all the idiotic--
Y-Y-Y-- I--
Blow me to Bermuda!
Where-- Uh, where did he go?
- To Bermuda, I suppose.
- Where's that?
Oh, an island way off somewhere that hasn't been discovered yet.
Will he ever come back?
Who knows?
Who knows anything?
For the crown of all England... let the tournament begin.
Oh, Kay, now it's up to the swords.
Swords? Swords?
Ah-- Oh, no! Kay?
What? What?
I, eh--
I-l-l forgot your sword.
Forgot my sword?
I-- I-l left it back at the inn.
Why, you bungling little fool!
I'll-- Oof!
You better get it!
Or don't you dare come back!
Let me in! Let me in!
Somebody please!
Please let me in!
It's no use, boy.
They've all gone to the tournament.
Oh, what'll I do?
Kay's got to have a sword.
Look, boy! Look!
There in the churchyard.
A sword!
Oh, Archimedes, a sword!
You're gonna have a time pullin' it out.
Huh! Watch it, boy!
Better leave it alone!
But Kay's got to have a sword.
Now, come on, quick.
Let's get out of here!
Y-You're up next, son.
Uh, better get ready.
Kay, Kay, here's a sword.
This is not my sword!
Hold on, Kay!
Wait a minute.
"Whoso pulleth out this sword--"
Ooh, eh-- It's the sword in the stone!
- The sword in the stone? It can't be.
- But look. It is!
- It's the marvellous sword.
- Hold everything.
Someone's pulled the sword from the stone.
Where did you get it, Wart?
I, l-l pulled it out of an anvil that was on a stone... i-in, in a churchyard.
- That's funny!
- The lad's a young Samson!
You're making a fool of us, boy.
Now tell the truth.
- But I did, sir. Ow! Ooh!
- Then come on, prove it.
- Ouch!
- Back to the stone with you.
- Yes, prove it.
- Come on, prove it.
All right, boy, let's have the miracle.
Now, wait a minute!
Anyone can pull it once it's been pulled.
Go to it, Kay.
Give it all you got.
Put your back into it!
- Here now!
- Here, here, here!
- Push him and see.
- It's my turn. One side!
- Pull this thing.
- Hold on, that's not fair.
I say we let the boy try it.
That's what I say.
Give the boy a chance.
Go ahead, son.
It's a miracle ordained by heaven.
This boy is our king.
Well, by Jove.
- What's the lad's name?
- Eh, Wart.
Oh, uh, I mean Arthur.
- Hail King Arthur!
- Hail King Arthur! Long live the king!
- Long live King Arthur! Long live the king.
- I can't believe it!
- Ooh, forgive me, son.
- Hail King Arthur.
- Long live the king. Long live...
- Forgive me.
- King Arthur. Long live the king.
- Oh, please don't, sir.
- Kay, bow down to your king.
- Hail King Arthur.
Long live the king.
- Hail King Arthur.
- So at last, the miracle... had come to pass in that far off time upon New Year's Day... and the glorious rein of King Arthur was begun.
I can't be a king, Archimedes. I don't know anything about ruling a country.
I told you to leave the thing in the stone, boy.
I'll, I'll run away, that's what I'll do.
They'll just have to get somebody else.
Better take the side door, Wart.
Out the side door.
Hail King Arthur!
Long live the King!
There's another door. Over there, over there! Come on, come on!
Long live King Arthur!
Long li--
Looks-Looks like we're surrounded, boy.
Oh, Archimedes,
I wish Merlin was here.
Merlin! Merlin!
Oh, Merlin, you're back from Ber-Ber-Ber--
Bermuda?
Yes, back from Bermuda... and the 20th century.
And believe me, you can have it.
One big modern mess!
Alakazam!
I'm in an awful pickle.
I'm king.
Ooh, he pulled the sword from the stone.
Ha-ha!
Of course, of course!
King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table.
- Round table?
- Oh, uh, w-would you rather have a square one?
Oh, no. Round'll be fine.
Boy, boy, boy.
You'll become a great legend.
They'll be writing books about you for centuries to come.
Why, they might even make a motion picture about you.
- Motion picture?
- Oh.
Uh, well, um-- Uh, that's something like television... without commercials.
Hail King Arthur
Long live the King
Text editing: Emanuel
Once upon a time... or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called...
Pepperland.
80,000 leagues beneath the sea it lay, or lie, I'm not too sure.
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe.
It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
- Yes, Your Blueness.
- What?!
We Meanies only take no for an answer.
Is that understood, Max?
No, Your Blueness.
That's better.
Are the troops in readiness?
No, your Blueness.
- The Bonkers?
- No.
- Clowns?
- No.
- Snapping Turks?
- No.
- Anti-music missiles?
- No.
- The dreadful Flying Glove?
- No.
Splendid!
Today, Pepperland goes bluely!
Fire!
The Meanies are coming!
The Meanies are coming!
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove!
Look out there, and what do you see?
- Tell him, Max.
- Someone running, Glove.
Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey?
Go, Glove, point!
And having pointed, pounce down!
I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii!
What?! What?!
The Glove is losing his touch.
Do your worst!
Explode them!
It's not polite to point!
Thing of beauty... destroy it for ever!
Sir, Sir, the Blue Meanies are coming!
Not here, Young Fred.
They wouldn't dare.
They would. They are.
What are you going to do?
Finish the quartet.
Fire!
Trio, sir?
Duet, sir?
Duet?
Solo!
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!
4 scores and 32 bars ago,
- our forefathers...
- Our quartet?
- And foremothers...
- Another quartet?
Made it in this yellow submarine...
- What, that little thing?
- To Pepperland.
Climb aboard, Young Fred.
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
Lord Admiral?
In that event, yes.
Hurry, Young Fred.
Go! Get help!
Where should I go?
No time for trivialities.
Woe... is me.
Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night.
And this is only Thursday morning.
Compared with my life,
Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl.
Nothing ever happens to me.
I feel like an old, splintered drumstick.
I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain.
Nothing ever happens to me.
Puss, puss-puss.
Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy.
Ahem, er...
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
No, I would not.
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine.
But that isn't logical, is it?
It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.
Help, help, help!
Thanks, I don't need any.
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
Be specific.
...Blue Meanies!
What you need is...
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent,
'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-please help.
Hiya, baby!
Your story has touched my heart.
Jump in, we'll get my friends.
- Bless you!
- Did I sneeze?
- Just park it here.
- I'll just park it here.
What would your friends be doing here?
Displaying.
- Displaying what?
- Displaying around.
Can't we take one of these?
No. I only work with my mates.
Frankenstein?
I used to go out with his sister.
- His sister?
- Yeah. Phyllis.
Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
You mustn't do that.
Can't help it.
I'm a born lever-puller.
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach.
Now listen to Old Fred.
...Blue Meanies!
What do you think?
I think he needs a rehearsal.
When do we leave?
Let's get the other two, John.
- What day is it?
- Sitarday.
Then George will be here.
George, what are you doing up there?
Now, what is it, Ringo?
Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
This chap here...
...Blue Meanies!
You're nuts, the pair of you.
Wait a minute, that's my car.
- How do you know it's your car?
- I'd know it anywhere.
- What's it look like, then?
- It's red with yellow wheels.
I mean, blue with orange wheels.
It's all in the mind.
- Move over, I'm driving.
- I got here first.
- I'll drive, if you like.
- No, you sit in the middle.
- I'm sitting in the middle.
- You said you were driving.
- I am driving.
- I'll get in the back, then.
Do you think we're interrupting something?
I think so.
We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?
It's all in the mind.
Try one of those doors.
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
Yes, they do.
- They do, though, don't they?
- Yes, they do.
- Don't dey, dough?
- Dough?
- Don't ask.
- Dat's dough.
What's the matter, fellas?
Blue Meanies?
Well, lads, what do you think?
I think that...
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead.
So, what do you think?
Well, then, um...
Pounding, overwhelming waves.
What do you think of that?
- Well, I think that...
- As a matter of fact, I...
I think...
- Well?
- I've forgotten.
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.
So, this is a submarine.
Soft, isn't it?
Not if you're on the bottom.
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
Then you start looking for a switch.
Perhaps this is it.
What time is it?
It's time for time.
Look, the hands are slowing down.
- Do you ever get the feeling...
- Yeah.
That things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
What's happening, John?
In my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
- Relatively speaking, that is.
- Of course.
- Maybe time's gone on strike.
- What for?
- Shorter hours.
- I don't blame it.
It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
- Why?
- It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
- You surprise me, Ringo.
- Why?
- Dealing in abstracts.
- Just because I'm a drummer...
- I don't half feel funny.
- You're not half the lad you used to be.
Look, everything's getting bigger.
It's not.
It's us that are getting smaller...
- I want my mam.
- And younger.
There you are, lads.
Old Fred will get you out of all this.
Look at that!
- It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
- It's not. It's Father Time.
- How do you know?
- I read it in a book.
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
What's that mean, Old Fred?
If we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
- What are we gonna do, then?
- We could always try a few buttons.
I want my mam.
Time's fast running out for us,
I'm afraid.
- Can't we do something to the clock?
- What do you mean, John?
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
Clever lad.
Something strange is happening.
It's speeding up now.
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
Uncannily.
There's someone in it. Look.
- And they're waving.
- It's a group of fellas.
Wave back.
Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
There's only two of us.
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is ourselves
- going backwards...
...in time!
Look at Ringo.
Oh dear, we're all the same.
Senile delinquents.
And I can hear my beard growing.
We'd better do something.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
That would explain a few things.
I'm glad I'm not young any more.
Or was it old?
- What kind of a sea is this?
- The Sea of Science.
Oh, yeah.
- He looks wrong.
- He doesn't look at all well.
In fact, he's horrible.
He's so ugly.
Really ugly!
Somebody push a button.
- There's a Cyclops.
- Can't be. He's got two eyes.
Then it must be a bi-Cyclops.
- There's another one.
- A whole cyclopedia.
There's a school of whales.
- They look a bit old for school.
- University, then.
- University of Whales.
- They look like dropouts to me.
You've got to steer clear.
- Steer clear?
- Yes, steer. Clear?
Yes, dear.
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
- Which button?
- That one.
This one?
That was the panic button.
- Poor Ringo.
- Poor lad.
Never did no harm to no-one.
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
Learn to sing trios.
No, let's save the poor devil.
I see footsteps.
- It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
- Preparing to attack.
- I don't half miss Ringo.
- He's far out there.
Always was.
- Here comes Ringo!
- 'H' is for hurry!
There goes Ringo.
It's seen us.
Find a boxing button.
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
Who cares? Find one.
Fire one!
Uh-oh, wrong one.
That.
There goes Ringo again.
- Rides well, doesn't he?
- 'E' is for ergent...
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum flask again.
- We'll be sucked into oblivion.
- Or even further.
Put her in reverse.
So long, sucker.
- Too much.
- Too soon.
Reverse! Reverse!
- Ringo time.
- 'L' is for love me...
Indians!
Help! Help!
'P' is for please...
So, press a button.
- How was it, Ringo?
- 'Arrowing.
Look who's back.
Full speed ahead.
- Oh, no.
- The motor's packing in.
By all the sea nymphets, we're losing power.
We're being swallowed.
What shall we do?
- Serve tea.
- Lovely.
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
- Maybe we should call a road service.
- Can't. No road.
And we're not sub-scribers.
Subscribers!
I know something about motors.
Let me have a look.
- Here.
- Is that the motor?
Can't you tell one when you see one?
Of course I can.
Let me peruse it.
- What do you think?
- I think I burned my finger.
Here, lads. Look at this.
- What do you think it is?
- Nothing.
Looks like nothing.
It's a local inhabitant.
He's probably one of the nothings.
At least that's something.
- Let's show him our motor.
- Steady on.
You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
But this is a nobody.
Medic, pedic, zed oblique, orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
Can you tell us where we're at?
A true Socratic query, that.
And who the Billy Shears are you?
Who? Who indeed am I?
Jeremy?
Hillary?
Boob?
- Ph. D?
- Who?
Eminent physicist, polyglot, classicist, prize-winning botanist, hard biting satirist,
- talented pianist, good dentist, too.
- Lousy poet.
Critic's voice, take your choice.
- Must be one of them angry young men.
- Or a daffy old creep.
I, daffy old creep?
- Do you speak English?
- Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
- Well, do you speak English?
- You know, I'm not sure.
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
Why don't we show him our motor?
Should we really... show him our motor?
He may not have seen one before.
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic, this motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
- He fixed it.
- He fixed it?
Great. Let's go.
I must complete my bust, two novels, finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
Must you always talk in rhyme?
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
Hey, fellas. Look.
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
- A boob for all seasons.
- How can he lose?
Were your notices good?
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
There must be a word for what he is.
Okay, men, all aboard.
Let's go somewhere.
What about him?
He's happy enough going around in circles.
Poor little fella.
I don't know.
Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
Look at him.
Can't he come with us?
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
Down the hatch.
A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
Its usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into my New Statesman piece.
- That's the hatch, friend.
- Indeed.
Steady now, crew.
Prepare to go forward.
- Forward.
- Forward.
Forward!
It's awfully quiet.
What shall we do, Jeremy?
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.
- Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
- What's he saying?
- What's he doing?
- Chewing gum will do the job.
A turn of the screw, and all is...
...and all is new.
I can't stop her.
'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent,
'L' is for love me...
'P' is for... goodbye?
- That was lovely, Jeremy.
- We've lost the sub for good.
- Or for bad.
- Or for worse.
- I'm sorry about that.
- But he did fix the motor.
- Where are we?
- It looks like the foothills.
- The foothills of what?
- The foothills of the headlands.
- Carry on, lads, carry on.
- Certainly was carrying on.
- I feel a draft.
- We must be near the Sea of Holes.
Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
Excuse us...
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?
Thanks.
Gosh, look at all this dust!
Where did it come from?
A chemical error and quite imprecise.
This is a condiment...
- Condi...
- A spice.
- He's right, you know. It's pepper.
- Pepper?
Pepper.
John?
Paul?
George?
Is anybody home?
- Where are we?
- A holey sea.
This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
Oh, boy...
How many do you think there are in all?
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
Didn't Old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes
- just before the Sea of Green?
- Yeah.
Through one of them slots must be the Sea of Green.
But which? Which one?
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
There are simply no holes in my education.
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
Great. What shall we do?
Be empirical. Look.
The booby's making more and more sense.
It's getting better all the time.
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green.
The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.
I've got a hole in my pocket.
Where's Jeremy?
He was over there.
- He's not here now.
- He must have jumped ship, then.
He wouldn't do that.
He's our friend.
Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?
Pepperland.
A bit salty around the edges.
- Looks all dingy.
- And drab.
And quiet.
Safe at last.
And none the worse for our adventures.
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
There's an eye in the apples.
There she blows!
Lord Mayor, sir...
I've made it, I'm back.
- Who's this?
- Our Lord Mayor.
He's been bonked.
Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself.
Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
All right, let's sing.
Do I hear music?
Do I see... Young Fred?
You do, Lord Mayor.
Bless my metronome.
And did you bring help?
Yes, yes. Look.
Holy pizzicato, Young Fred.
It's quite uncanny, your faces...
We're quite cute, really.
You could pass for the originals.
We are the originals.
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.
They couldn't be much with a name like that.
Sergeant Pepper?
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
Where are your instruments?
- Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
- Sea of Monsters.
We'll get other instruments,
Lord Mayor.
Not a chance.
The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
They hate music that much, do they?
They shrink at the very sound.
Okay, you guys.
It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
Aim, fire!
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
- What do we do?
- Coagulate with the crowd.
Cut-outs at the ready.
Then let's cut out.
What a grand bandstand.
That's where the gear's kept.
Come on.
Cavey, cavey.
All right, the coast is clear.
Now's our chance.
- But how'll we get over?
- Easy. Follow me.
A-ha! You fools!
It's not very light in here, is it?
Shh! Keep the noise down.
- Look what I found.
- It's their uniforms.
- Nice bit of gear, that.
- They'll look great on, eh?
- Dey will, won't dey?
- Won't dey, dough.
- How do I look?
- Groovy. How about me?
- Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
- Oh, heck.
A million billion Meanies.
They're coming this way.
Hide!
- Do you think they heard us?
- I hope not.
- What did you say?
- Shh!
Good plan.
Look. They're all asleep.
They look cute when they're asleep.
Almost human.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- On tiptoe.
- Tiptoe through the Meanies...
- Shh!
Let's exude.
Relax, lads.
Not a Meanie in sight.
- Not even a teeny Meanie.
- Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
- Look. Breakfast.
- I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
Look out.
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
- One, two, three, four...
- Five.
Five?
- Sound off, one, two, three...
- Four.
- One, two, three...
- Four.
- One, two...
- Three.
- Three?
- Two.
- Two?
- One.
One?
Are you Bluish?
You don't look Bluish.
Run for it.
Right, men. We've made it.
- Instruments at the ready.
- Okay, on the beat.
A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six.
- Can't you make it three?
- All right.
On the beat of three...
A-one, a-two, a-three...
It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill.
You're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.
We'd love to take you home.
- The hills are alive...
...with the sound of music.
Who is responsible for this?
Rimsky Korsakov?
Guy Lombardo?
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue.
Tomorrow, the world!
Bring in my Bloobers.
- Who?
- Who?
There you are, my little Glovey-dovey.
Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts.
Smash them! Squash them!
Crash them!
Oblue-terate them!
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
- Glove?
- Glove?
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
Open your mouth, it won't hurt.
John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
It's easy.
All you need is love.
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
Hey, wait, and watch.
It's all in the mind, you know.
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
In Pepperland, all things are possible.
- It's not a goldfish bowl.
- Just a big glass bowl, then.
- It's blue glass.
- It must be from Kentucky.
There's something inside.
- Four fellas.
- What are they doing there?
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
- It can't be.
- It's us.
- But we're here.
- It's Sgt. Pepper's...
- Lonely...
- Hearts Club...
Band.
The resemblance is truly striking.
If I could come in here...
I think the theory put forward by Einstein could well be applied here.
The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
- John!
...beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
- John!
- George?
- How do we get them out?
- Break the glass.
- We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
- Nothing is Beatle-proof.
Have you got your drumsticks with you?
A drum break might shatter it.
- No, I haven't.
- Have a look in your pocket.
I've got a hole in my pocket.
I wonder if...
Yeah, it still works.
Ringo, we take back all we said.
You're a genius, a sheer genius.
I know, I know, I know.
- Like coloured telly.
- Like crystal.
They're decanting.
Hello, brother.
Yeah, without a doubt.
- We're the spitting image of each other.
- Golly, yeah.
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
- Yes, I'm the alter-ego man.
- And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.
I'm glad you asked me that.
Because as a matter of fact there's a war on.
Then, brothers in war, to the skirmish must we hence.
Shall we hence?
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence.
Beatles to battle. Charge!
- We're surrounded.
- Nice dog, though.
What do you say?
Sing it.
Do you know any more?
Play it!
Jeremy, can it be you?
Can it be me? I think you'd better inquire of the guards, for when I was captured, they took all my cards.
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy.
- The whole world's being attacked.
- What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs versus the guard?
Oh, guard!
Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut, right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy!
Come on, Ringo!
Get back! Get back!
Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies!
You're advancing the wrong way!
Retreat backwards!
Get back there now!
My kingdom for a horse!
I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
He does, does he?
Yes, I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
You don't, eh?
We'll soon see about that.
He does in truth seem quite annoyed, some reference material before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
A rosy nose?
Speak your last piece!
Peace, peace, supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour, turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom, bloom, bloom...
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody,
- I knew he was somebody.
- You're right.
Hello there, blue people.
Won't you join us?
Buck up, and otherwise go mingle.
- What do you say?
- Max?
Your Blue...
I mean, your Newness!
It's no longer a blue world, Max.
Where could we go?
Argentina?
Are you with us?
Will you join?
- Shall we?
- No!
Yes, your Newness!
- Yes, Max...
- Yes.
Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing and chasing of blues, the very best word for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
Yes, let us mix, Max.
I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of Happiness.
- Catchy tune, that.
- I can't seem to get it out of my head.
- Then shake it.
- That's what we've been doing all night.
Yeah, it was a great party.
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs.
- Here is the motor.
- And I've got a little love.
- And I've got a hole in my pocket.
- A hole?
Half a hole, anyway.
I gave the rest to Jeremy.
What can he do with half a hole?
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
Look at John, will you?
What's the matter, John?
Blue Meanies?
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
- How's that?
- Singing.
One... two... three... four
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss.
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon.
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
Like that's ever going to happen.
What a loony.
Shrek
Beware
Stay out
I think he's in here.
All right. Lets get it!
Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?
Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains.
Well actually that would be a giant.
Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse.
They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin.
They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes.
Actually, it's quite good on toast.
Back, back beast, back!
I warned you!
Right.
This is the part, where you run away.
Yeah!
And stay out.
Wanted. Fairytale creatures.
Right, this one is full. Take it away.
Give me that.
Your fine days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch.
Next. -Come on.
Sit down there! And be quiet!
This cage is so small.
You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change.
Please, give me another chance.
Oh, shut up!
Next.
What do we got?
This little wooden puppet.
I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy.
Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.
No! Please, don't let them do it!
Next. What do you got?
Well, I've got a talking donkey!
Right.
Well that's good for ten schillings, if you can prove it.
Oh, go ahead fella.
Well?
He's just a li..., just a little nervous.
He's really quite a chatterbox.
You boneheaded donkey!
That's it. I have heard enough. Guards!
No, no, he talks, he does!
I can talk. I love to talk.
I've talked to...
Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear!
Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He can fly!
He can talk! -That's right, fool!
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey!
You might have seen house fly, maybe even a superfly.
But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly!
Seize him!
Get him! This way! Hurry!
You there. Ogre. -I.
By the order of lord Farquaad.
I am authorized to place you both under arrest.
And transport you to designated resettlement facility.
Oh really?
You and what army?
Can I say something to you?
Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible.
Are you talking to...
...me?
Yes, I was talking to you.
Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards.
They thought that was all over there.
And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods.
That really made me feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
But I...
I don't have any friends.
And I'm not going out there by myself.
Hey wait a minute.
I have a great idea...
I'll stick with you.
You and me in green fighting machine.
Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us.
Oh, a, that was really scary.
Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you definitively need some tic-tac or something,
'cause your breath stinks!
Man you've? my note!
Just like the time...
...and then I ate some rotten berries.
Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day.
Why are you following me?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause I'm all alone, there is no one here, beside me.
My problems have all gone.
There's no one to derive me.
But you got to have free... -Stop singing!
Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends.
Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest.
Listen! Little donkey.
Take a look at me! What am I?
A...
...really tall?
No! I'm an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and pitchforks.
Doesn't that bother you?
Nope.
Really? -Really really.
Oh?
Man, I like you. What's your name?
A..., Shrek.
Shrek?!
But do you know, what
I like about you, Shrek?
You've got that kind of: "I don't care what nobody thinks of me" thing.
I like that, I respect that,
Shrek. You're all right.
Uh, look at that.
Who would wanna live in a place like that?
That would be my home.
Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful.
You know you're quite a decorator.
It's amazing what you did with such a modest budget.
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.
I guess, you don't entertain much, do you?
I like my privacy.
You know I do to. That's another thing, we have in common.
Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face.
You try to give them a hint and they won't leave.
And then there's that big occurred silence, you know?
Can I stay with you? -What?
Can I stay with you, please.
Of course! -Really?
No. -Please! I don't want to go back there.
You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak.
Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick together!
You got to let me stay! Please! Please!
OK, OK.
- But one night only.
- Huh, thank you!
A, what are you do... No!
This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories.
And in the morning...
I'm making waffles.
Where do I sleep?
Outside!
Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know,
I don't know you and you don't know me...
...so I guess, outside is best for me.
Here I go.
Good night.
I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside.
Sit by myself outside, I guess.
I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me.
- I thought, I told you to stay outside.
- I am outside.
Well James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have?
It's not...
What a lovely bed. -Got you!
I found some cheese. Awful stuff.
- Is that you Gordon?
- How did you know?
Enough! What are you doing in my house?
Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table!
Where would we supposed to put her. The bed's taken.
What?
I live in a swamp. I've put up signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre!
What do I have to do, to get a little privacy?
Oh, no! No, no!
What are you doing in my swamp?
All right, get out of here. All of you. Move it! Come on, let's go.
And hurry up, hurry up.
No, no, not there. Not there!
Hey don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.
Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What?
We were forced to come here. -By who?
Lord Farquaad. He?
All right.
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
Oh I do. I know where he is.
Does anyone else know where to find him?
- Anyone at all?
- Me. -Anyone?
Oh pick me, I know! Me, me.
Ok, fine.
Attention all fairy tale things!
Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially warned up.
In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get all off my land and back where you came from.
You. You're coming with me.
All right. That's what
I like to hear, man.
Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city adventure. I love it.
I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek! I'm on road again...
What did I say about singing?
- Can I whistle?
- No.
- Well, can I hummer?
- All right.
That's enough. He's ready to talk.
Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man.
You monster.
I'm not a monster here. You are.
You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world.
- Now tell me! Where are the others?
- Eat me.
I've tried to be fair to you, creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end!
- Tell me! Or I'll...
- No, no, not the buttons.
Not gumdrop buttons.
All right! Who's hiding them?
Ok, I'll tell you.
- Do you know the muffin-man? -The muffin-man?
- The muffin-man. -Yes,
I know the muffin-man.
Who lives on Proully lane?
- Well, she's married to the muffin-man. -The muffin-man!
- The muffin-man! -She's married to the muffin-man.
My lord! We found it.
Well then, what are you waiting for? Bring it in.
Magic mirror.
Don't tell him anything!
Evening.
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?
Well, technically, you're not a king.
A..., felonious.
- You were saying.
- What I mean is a...
...you're not a king, yet.
But you can become one. All you have to do, is marry a princess.
Go on.
So, just sit back and relax my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
And here they are.
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shading from a kingdom far, far away.
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters.
Please welcome... Cinderella.
Bachelorette number two is a kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.
Although she lives with seven other man, she is not easy.
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and find out what a live wife she is.
Come on. Give it up for... Show-white.
And last but certainly not least.
Bachelorette number three is a fire-breathing?, dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off.
She's a loaded pistol who likes Pina
Coladas and getting cut in the rain.
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.
So will it be, bachelorette number one? Bachelorette number two?
Or bachelorette number three?
- Two...
- Three! -Two!
One. No, no, no.
Three. Pick number three my lord.
Ok, ok. Number three.
Lord Farquaad. You've chosen... princess Fiona.
She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect.
All I have to do is just find someone...
But I probably should mention little thing that happens at night...
- I'll do it!
- Yes, but after sunset...
Silence!
I will make this princess Fiona my queen.
And Duloc will finally have the perfect king!
Captain! Assemble your finest man.
We're going to have a tournament!
That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc.
I've told you I'll find it.
So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle.
Aha, that's the place.
Do you think maybe he's compensating for something.
Hey, hey wait up Shrek!
- Hey, you!
- No, no!
Wait a second.
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just...
It's quiet.
Too quiet.
Where is everybody?
Hey look at this.
Wow!
- Let's do that again.
- No. no.
All right. You're going the right way for smack bottom.
Sorry about that.
That champion should have the honor, no, no...
...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon.
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner up will take his place.
And so on, and so forth.
Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
Applause.
Let the tournament begin.
What is that?
Ugh, it's hideous.
Oh, that's not very nice.
It's just a donkey.
Indeed.
Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named champion.
How about him.
Oh, hey. Now, come on.
Can't we just settle this over a pint?
No?
All right then.
Come on.
Hey Shrek! Let me, let me!
The chair! Give him the chair!
Thank you. Thank you, very much.
I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel!
Shall I give the order sir?
No. I have a better idea.
People of Duloc. I give you our champion!
What?
Congratulation, Ogre.
You've won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.
Quest? I'm already on a quest.
A quest to get my swamp back!
- Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp!
Where you dumped those fairytale creatures.
Indeed.
All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal.
Go on this quest for me and
I'll give you your swamp back.
Exactly the way it was?
Down to the last slime covered toast tool.
- And the squatters?
- As good as gone.
What kind of quest?
Ok, let me get this straight!
We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it with full of freaks on the first place.
- Is that about right?
- You know what?
Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk.
I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them?
You know,?. Grab his bones to make you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick.
Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate.
Got a knife, cut open their spleens and drink their fluids.
Does that sound good to you?
A, no, not really, no.
For your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think.
- Example.
- Example?
OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions.
- They stink?
- Yes, no.
- O, they make you cry.
- No.
Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start? little wild hairs?
No! Layers! Onions have layers.
Ogres have layers. Onions have layers.
You get it? We both have layers.
O, you both have layers.
You know not everybody likes onions.
Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers.
I don't care what everyone likes.
Ogres are not like cakes.
You know what else everyone likes? Paffe.
Have you ever met a person and you say: "Hey, let's get some paffe" and they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious.
No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden.
Ogres are like onions. End of story.
Bye, bye. See you lather.
Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.
You know I think I've preferred your humming.
Do you have a tissue or something,
'cause I'm making a mess.
Just the word paffe has made me start slimying
Why, Shrek, did you do that?
Man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off.
My mouth was opened and everything.
Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead.
It's brimstone. We must be getting close.
Yeah, right, brimstone.
Don't be talking? brimstone. I know what I smell and? no brimstone.
And they don't come of stone neither.
Sure it's big enough, but look at the location.
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogres have layers?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers.
We wear? sleeves.
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
- You know what I mean.
- Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs.
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava!
Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok?
For emotional support.
We'll just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time.
- Really?
- Really really.
Ok. That makes me feel so much better.
Just keep moving and don't look down.
Don't look down, don't look down.
Shrek! I'm looking down!
I can't do this. Just let me off right now, please.
- But you're already half way.
- Yeah, but I know that half is safe.
Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.
Shrek, no, wait.
Don't do that!
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?
- Oh. This?
- Yes, that!
Yes, yes. Do it. OK.
- No, Shrek!
- I'm doing it.
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.
That will do Donkey, that will do.
Cool.
So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her.
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.
- Are you afraid?
- No, but shhhhh.
Oh, good. Me neither.
Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid.
Here's a..., something responsible of the situation.
Not to mention dangerous situation.
And there's dragon that breathes fire.
I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, but they're scare. You know what I mean.
I'm sure he's heavier than a cow...
Donkey. Two things. Ok?
Shut, up.
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.
Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess.
The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.
What makes you think she'll be there?
I read it in a book once.
Cool. You handle the dragon,
I'll handle the stairs.
Oh, I'll find those stairs.
I'll?. That's right.
Those stairs won't know which way they go.
The drafting stairs,?
Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I'm master of the stairs.
I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I'd step all over it.
Well, at least we know where the princess is.
- But where is the...
- Dragon!
Donkey, look out!
Got you.
Oh, what large teeth you have.
I mean, white sparkling teeth.
You probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you got there.
And do I detect the hint of minty freshness?
And you know what else?
You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon,
'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out.
What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye?
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know I'm a asthmatic and
I don't know if we would worked out.
You'd be blowing smoke and stuff.
Shrek!
No, Shrek! Shrek!
- Wake up!
- What?
Are you princess Fiona?
I am.
Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go.
But wait, sir knight.
This be our first meeting.
Should not be wonderful, romantic moment?
Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time.
Hey, what are you doing? You know, you should sweep me out of my feet.
Out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed.
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?
Uh-um.
But we have to sing through this moment.
You can residing of a poem to me.
A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something.
I don't think so.
Well, can I at least know a name of my champion?
Shrek.
So, Shrek.
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Thanks.
- You didn't slay the dragon?
- It's not my job to do this. Now, come on!
But this isn't right.?
That's what all the other knights did.
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame.
That's not the point.
Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there.
Well, I have to save my ass.
What kind of knight are you?
One of a kind.
...rush into a physical relationship.
I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude.
That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude.
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
Hey, what are you doing?
Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and take this one step at the time.
I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying.
As friends, maybe even as?
Hey don't do that. That's my tail. That's ma personal tail.
And you're going to tear it off...
Oh, no. No!
- It talks?!
- Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick.
Ok, you two. Head for the exit.
I'll take care of the dragon.
Ruuuuun!
You did it. You rescued me.
Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a...
...a little unorthodox I admit, but by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt.
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed.
I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed.
She thinks I'm a steed.
The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight.
- Aah, no.
- Why not?
I have helmet hair.
Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer.
Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust.
But, how will you kiss me?
What? That wasn't in a job description.
- Maybe it's a perk?
- No. It's destiny.
You must know how it goes.
A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight.
And then they share true love's first kiss.
With Shrek? You think, wait...
...you think Shrek is your true love?
Well, yes.
You think that Shrek is your true love.
What is so funny?
Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok?
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.
Now, now remove your helmet.
Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.
- Take it off!
- No!
- Now!
- Ok, easy.
As you command your highness.
You're an Ogre.
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
Well, yes, actually.
Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre.
Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok?
He's the one, who wants to marry you.
Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me?
Good question. You should ask him that, when we get there.
But I have to be rescued by my true love.
Not by some Ogre and his pet.
Well so much for noble steed.
Look princess. You're not making my job any easier.
Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.
You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly,
I'll be waiting for him right here.
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right?
- I'm a delivery boy.
- You wouldn't dare.
- You coming donkey?
- Put me down!
Yeah, I'm right behind you.
Put me down or you will suffer the consequences.
This is not dignified. Put me down.
Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her, that way. Now, how you let her down real easy, so her feelings aren't hurt?
But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. How do you do this?
Just tell her, she's not your true love.
Everyone knows it what happens when you find...
Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better.
Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. It's beautiful.
And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. What's he like?
Well, let me put it this way, princess.
Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.
Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him.
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.
You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad.
Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow
Tomorrow?
It will take that long?
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No. That would take longer.
We can keep going.
But there are robbers in the woods.
Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is definitely something that sounds good.
Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything we're gonna see in this forest.
I need to find somewhere to camp, now!
Hey, over here.
Shrek, we can do better than that. Now,
I don't think this is decent for princess.
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.
Homey touches? Like what?
A door.
Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night.
Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 'cause I will...
I said good night!
Shrek! What are you doing?
I just..., you know...
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.
And that one, that's Throwback.
The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.
Right. Yeah.
Hey, can you tell my future form these stars?
Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey.
They tell stories. Look.
There's Blodna, the "Flatulent"
You can guess what he is famous for.
All right. Now I know you're making this up.
No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters running away from his stag.
Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots.
You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear.
Forget it.
Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway?
- Our swamp?
- You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff.
We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our.
There's just me and my swamp.
And the first thing I'm gonna do, is build a ten foot wall around my land.
You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now.
You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.
No, do you think?
- Are you hiding something?
- Never mind Donkey.
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?
No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.
- Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to talk about it?
- Oh, Why you block? -I'm not blocking. -Oh yes you are.
- Donkey, I'm warning you.
- Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who?
Everyone, ok?
- Oh, now we're getting somewhere.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do you got against the whole world anyway?
Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok?
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.
People take one look at me and go: AAA... Help! Run!
A big stupid ugly Ogre.
They judge me, before they even know me.
That's why I'm better off alone.
You know what? When we met, I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.
Yeah, I know.
So, a... Are there any donkeys up there?
Well, there's a Cabby.
The small and annoying.
Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there. That one, over there?
That's the moon.
Again. Show me again.
Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.
Perfect.
Yeah. You know I like like that. Oh come on baby...
- Donkey. Wake up.
- What? -Wake up.
Morning. How do you like your eggs?
- Good morning princess.
- What's all this about?
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.
Thanks.
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.
- Shrek!
- What? It's a compliment.
Better out than in I always say.
But that's no way to behave in front of a princess.
- Thanks.
- She's as nasty as you are.
You know. You're not exactly what I've expected.
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.
Princess!
What are you doing?
?mon shery, for I am your saviour. And
I am rescuing you from this green... beast.
Hey! That's my princess.
Go find your own.
Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here?
Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are.
Oh, of course. How rude that was.
Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men!
Man, that was annoying.
Oh, you little...
Shall we?
?all the forin?
Whoa, hold on, now.
Where did that come from?
- What?
- That. Back there. That was amazing.
Where did you learn that?
Well, when one lives alone one has to learn these things in case there's a...
There is an arrow in your butt.
What? Oh, would you look at that.
Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
- What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt.
- Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt!
- Oh, no. Shrek's going to die.
- Donkey, I'm ok.
You can't do this to me Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head?.
- Does anyone know how to handle...
- Donkey! Calm down.
If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!
- Donkey!
- Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?
- For getting rid of the Donkey.
Now, you hold still and
I'll yank this thing out.
- Hey! Easy with the yanking.
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
No, no. It's tender. What you're doing here is the opposite...
- Don't move. -Ok, look.
Time out. -Would you... Ok.
What do you propose we do?
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming!
Not good.
Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it.
Nothing happened.
We were just a...
Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok?
Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind.
The princess here was just... Au!
Hey, what's that? Is that...
There it is, princess.
- Your future awaits you.
- That's Duloc?
Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a
I guess we better move on.
Sure, but Shrek...
- I'm worried about Donkey.
- What?
I mean. Look at him.
He doesn't look so good.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.
- Well, that's what they always say.
And the next thing you know you're on your back.
- Dead!
- You know she's right. You look awful.
- Do you want to sit down?
- You know, I'll make you up some tea.
Well, I won't say nothing, but
I've got this twinge in my neck. And if
I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see?
- He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner.
- I'll get the firewood.
Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs. I don't have any thumbs!
I think I need a hug.
This is good. This is really good.
- What is this?
- Wheat rat.
- Rotisserie style.
- No kidding.
- Oh, this is delicious.
- Well, they also great in stews.
Now, I don't mean to brag, but
I make a mean wheat rat stew.
I guess I'll be dining a little different late tomorrow night.
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime.
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.
Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it.
I'd like that.
- Ah..., princess?
- Yes, Shrek?
I'm a... I was wondering.
Are you... a...
Are you gonna eat that?
Man, isn't this romantic.
Just look at that sunset.
Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late.
- What?
- Wait a minute. I see what's going on here.
You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you?
Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified. You know I'll better go inside.
But don't feel bad, princess. I used to be afraid of the dark too.
Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here.
Oh, what are you talking about.
Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look,
I'm an animal and I got instincts.
And I know that you two are digging on each other. I can feel it.
Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones.
Just go in there and tell her how you feel.
There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know.
I'm not saying that
I do, 'cause I don't.
She's a princess and I'm...
...an Ogre.
Yeah, an Ogre.
- Hey, where are you going?
- To get more firewood.
Princess. Princess Fiona?
Princess, where are you?
Princess?
It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games.
- No, no.
- Help! Shrek! Shrek!
- No. -Shrek!
- It's ok. It's ok.
- What did you do with the princess?
- Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess.
- It's me, in this body.
- Oh my god. You ate the princess.
- Can you hear me?
- Donkey!
Listen, keep breathing.
I'll get you out of there!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
This is me.
Princess? What happened to you?
You're a... different.
- I'm ugly, ok?
- Yeah.
Was it something that you ate? 'Cause
I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.
- You are what you eat, I say.
- No. I've been this way as long as I can remember.
What do you mean? Look, I've never seen you like this before.
It only happens when the sun goes down.
By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find true love's first kiss.
Then, take love's true form...
- Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.
- It's the spell.
When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
Every night I become this.
This horrible ugly beast.
I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me.
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this?
All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.
Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly.
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24/7.
But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this is not how a princess is meant to look.
Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad?
I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell.
But you know, you're kind of an Ogre.
And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common.
Shrek?
Princess, I... How is it going first of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty.
And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it, because you're pretty.
But I like you anyway. A...
I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go.
Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together.
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.
Don't you see, Donkey?
That's just how it has to be.
It's the only way to break the spell.
Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth.
No, no. You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know.
What's the point of being unable to talk? You got to keep secrets.
Promise you won't tell. Promise!
All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.
You know, before this is over, I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies.
Look at my eye twitching.
I tell him, I tell him not.
I tell him. I tell him not.
I tell him!
Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want...
Shrek. Are you all right?
Perfect. Never been better.
I... There's something
I have to tell you.
You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night.
- You've heard what I said?
- Every word.
I thought you'd understand?
Oh, I understand! Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast!
- I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
- Yeah, well, it does.
Ah, right on time. Princess. I brought you a little something.
What I missed? What I missed?
- Princess Fiona.
- As promised. Now hand it over.
Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp.
Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go.
Before I change my mind.
Forgive me princess for startling you, but you startled me.
For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before.
- I am lord Farquaad.
- Lord Farquaad?
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for
I was just saying short... farewell.
Oh. That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre.
- It's not like it has feelings.
- No. You're right. It doesn't.
Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona,
I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...
Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd...
No! I mean I... Why wait?
Let's get married today. Before sunset.
Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do.
There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests... Captain! Round up some guests.
Farewell Ogre.
Shrek, what are you doing?
You let her get away.
- Yeah, so what.
- Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know.
- I talked to her last night. She's...
- Yeah I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such good friend, why didn't you follow her home?
- Shrek. I want to go with you.
- I told you, didn't I?
You're not coming home with me. I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else!
Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!
- But. I thought...
- Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong.
Shrek.
Donkey?
What are you doing?
I was thinking of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.
Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp. Not through it.
It is around your half. See? That's your half and this is my half.
Oh, your half?
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.
I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head
- Back off!
- No. You back off!
- This is my swamp.
- Our swamp.
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go!
- Stubborn jackass.
- Smelly Ogre.
Fine!
Hey, hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you, yet.
- Well, I'm through with you!
- Well, you know. You were always me, me, me.
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn!
So you just shut up and pay attention!
You are mean to me, you insult me, you don't appreciate anything that I do!
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
Because that's what friend do. They forgive each other!
Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. I forgive you for stabbing me in the back!
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy. You're afraid of your own feelings.
- Go away.
- See? There you are, doing it again. Just like you did it to Fiona.
And all she ever do, was like you. Maybe even love you.
Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature.
- I heard that you two were talking.
- She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about...
...somebody else.
She wasn't talking about me? Well then, who was she talking about?
No way, I'm not saying anything.
You won't listen to me, right? Right?
- Donkey.
- No!
Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.
I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.
Can you forgive me?
- Hey, that's the friends are for, right?
- Right.
- Friends?
- Friends.
So? What did Fiona said about me?
Why are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her.
The wedding! We'll never make it in time!
Never fear! For where there is a will, there is a way.
And I have I way.
Donkey?
- I guess this is just my act of magnetism.
- Oh, come here, you.
All right. All right. Don't get all started. No one likes kissass.
All right, hop on. Hold on tight.
I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet.
People of Duloc. We gather here today to bear witness to reunion of our new king...
Excuse me. Could you just skip ahead to "I do's"?
Go on.
Go ahead and have some fun, if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?
Shrek, wait, wait a minute. You want to do this right, don't you?
- What are you talking about?
- It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for.
The priest is going to say: "Speak now or forever hold your peace".
And that's where you say: "I object".
- I don't have time for this.
- Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!
Look, you love this woman, don't you?
- Yes.
- You want to hold her!
- Yes. -Please her! -Yes!
Then you got to, got to try a little tender love.
- The chicks love that romantic crap.
- All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?
We got to check it out.
And as so by the power of these two...
What do you see?
- I now pronounce you...
- There they go!
- ... he all ready said it.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
I object!
Shrek?
Oh, now what does he want?
Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you?
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.
- What are you doing here?
- Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you.
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...
- Fiona! I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?
Well it's a little late for that. So if you'll excuse me.
- But you can't marry him!
- And why not?
Because, because he's just marrying you so he can be king.
- Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
- He's not your true love.
- What do you know about true love?
- Well, I... I'm in...
Oh, this is precious.
The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess.
Laugh.
Shrek. Is this true?
Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me!
By night one way, by day another.
I wanted to show you before.
Well. That explains a lot.
Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. I order you to get them out of my sight.
- Now! Get them! Get them, both!
- No!
This marriage is minding, and that makes me king. See? See?
- Shrek!
- No.
- Don't just stand there, you dogs.
- Get out of my way.
No! Shrek!
- And as for you my wife.
- Fiona!
I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!
I will have order. I will have potential. I will have...
All right, nobody move! I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it.
I'm a donkey on the edge!
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?
Go ahead Shrek.
- Fiona?
- Yes, Shrek?
I love you.
Really?
Really, really.
I love you too.
A time for true love's first kiss...
Fiona?
Fiona? Are you all right?
Yes. But I don't understand.
I'm supposed to be beautiful.
But you are beautiful.
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.
God bless us, everyone.
The End.
{2502}{2580}The story I want to tell you,|can not be found in a book.
{2593}{2682}They say the history of the West was|written from the saddle of a horse.
{2701}{2753}But it's never been told|from the heart of one.
{2781}{2813}Not until now.
{2861}{2900}I was born here.
{2905}{2975}In this place that would come|to be called the ''Old West''
{2990}{3101}But to my kind, the land was ageless.|It had no beginning and no end.
{3117}{3180}No boundary between earth and sky.
{3213}{3301}Like the wind in the Buffalo grass.|We belong here.
{3326}{3362}We will always belong here.
{3445}{3502}They say the mustang is the|spirit of the West.
{3517}{3573}Whether that West|was won or lost in the end
{3582}{3619}You have to decide for yourself.
{3630}{3707}But the story|I want to tell you is true.
{3728}{3757}I was there.
{3776}{3812}And I remember.
{3832}{3910}I remember the sun, and the sky|and the wind calling my name.
{3925}{3982}In the time when the wild|horses ran free.
{10805}{10868}And so I grew from colt to stallion
{10870}{10900}As wild and reckless
{10901}{10941}As thunder over the land.
{10948}{10985}Racing with the eagle.
{10987}{11021}Soaring with the wind.
{11022}{11104}Flying? |There were times I believed I could.
{11869}{11898}Like my father before me
{11900}{11994}I became leader of the Cimarron herd.|And with that honour
{11996}{12037}Came responsibility.
{17370}{17425}Something new came upon|the land one night.
{17441}{17496}Something that changed my life |forever...
{17518}{17587}And so my journey began.
{18973}{19024}A wiser horse might have turned|and ran.
{19053}{19109}But I wanted to know what|strange creature was here.
{20008}{20032}Look.
{20087}{20157}Man, look at that stallion, |it is beautiful.
{21014}{21046}Follow the horse! Let's go!
{23917}{23944}Look out!
{24511}{24544}Don't you get away!
{26023}{26056}I was scared.
{26057}{26103}I didn't know what was going|to happen to me.
{26127}{26148}At least my mother|and the herd were safe.
{29740}{29784}What seems to be the|problem, gentlemen?
{29789}{29825}We got this crazy one here, Sir.
{29857}{29876}Really?
{29991}{30043}The army has dealt with|wild horses before.
{30061}{30099}This one will be no different.
{30209}{30233}I remember the first time
{30235}{30293}I saw a rattler curled up in my path
{30340}{30389}-Induct this animal, Sargent.|-Yes Sir!
{30385}{30445}This one didn't look like a rattler.
{30437}{30500}But I was still thinking...|snake.
{30529}{30570}Grab him, grab him.
{30671}{30716}Okay Murphy, he's all yours.
{30743}{30773}He's a wild one.
{30809}{30866}We'll see how wild he is,|when I am done with him.
{31057}{31093}You want a fight, do you?
{31364}{31386}Right.
{31982}{32013}Make sure that's good tight.
{32182}{32219}Murphy, look out! Watch out!
{33115}{33167}Murphy, are you okay?
{33237}{33352}Corporal, round up some volunteers to|take this animal to the stables.
{33360}{33455}Not the stables. -Sir? |-The corral.
{33473}{33501}It's time to break that horse.
{36435}{36518}Sergent. -Yes Sir.|Tight this horse to the post.
{36536}{36601}No food or water. Three days.
{36605}{36623}Yes Sir.
{37973}{38037}My heart galloped through|the sky that night
{38059}{38100}Back to my herd.
{38108}{38138}Where I belonged.
{38173}{38212}And I wonder if they'd miss me
{38228}{38274}As much as I miss them.
{39570}{39594}We got a hostile!
{39744}{39795}Bring him there this way.
{39934}{39962}Well, what do we have here?
{40005}{40048}We caught him|by the supply wagon, Sir.
{40106}{40143}Ah, a Dakota.
{40165}{40242}Not as tall as the Cheyenne,|and fine featured as the Crow.
{40265}{40316}Take him away gentlemen,|show him our best.
{40325}{40369}Corporal, take him to the stock case.
{40371}{40438}Not the stock case. The post.
{40461}{40482}No food or water.
{40706}{40742}What are you looking at boy?
{40793}{40837}He was called Little Creak.
{40843}{40884}And he seemed different from the rest.
{42212}{42291}There were just no end to the |strange ways of the two legged.
{42758}{42854}With the Colonel permission, Sir. |Incoming patrol report hostiles |headed North.
{42864}{42910}The railroad has expressed concern, Sir.
{42917}{42964}They requested additional patrols.
{42986}{43009}How long has it been, Sergent?
{43010}{43070}Sir?|-The mustang.
{43081}{43117}How long has it been tide?
{43127}{43156}Three days, Sir.
{43173}{43191}Good.
{43200}{43240}Fetch my crop and spurs.
{43717}{43743}Take it easy!
{43813}{43839}Back up! Back up!
{45216}{45293}You see gentlemen,|any horse can be broken.
{45381}{45407}Move along mustang.
{45500}{45581}There are those in Washington who believe|the West will never be settled.
{45627}{45700}The northern pacific railroad |will never breach Nebraska.
{45796}{45902}A hostile Dakota will never |submit to providence.
{45980}{46036}And it is that manner of small thinking.
{46048}{46105}That would say this horse |could never be broken.
{46136}{46215}Discipline, time, and patience.
{46248}{46294}Are the three great levelers.
{46421}{46489}Sometimes a horse's gotta do,|what a horse's gotta do
{46514}{46562}And this was one of those times.
{47465}{47492}Get off me!
{48104}{48173}Soldier! Secure that horse!
{49774}{49826}I wasn't sure|what happened back there.
{49829}{49884}And I wasn't about to stop and ask.
{49892}{49955}All I knew was I was headed home.
{50561}{50584}I couldn't believe it.
{50594}{50692}One moment I was free,|and the next... more ropes.
{54379}{54413}I couldn't understand it.
{54424}{54471}She treated the scrawny two-legged
{54473}{54504}Like one of our kind.
{54509}{54533}Prancing around him
{54535}{54576}Like a love struck ear ring.
{54605}{54649}It was down right unnatural.
{54834}{54934}Great mustang, today I will ride you.
{54996}{55037}This ought to be good...
{55637}{55669}Mares.
{55819}{55873}Okay, Rain, lets see if you can teach
{55875}{55912}This mustang some manners.
{57734}{57761}Okay, I admit it
{57766}{57795}She was charming
{57809}{57866}In a stubborn, irritating kind of way.
{57880}{57930}So, I let her show me her world.
{59917}{59957}Bye-Bye horsey.
{62830}{62870}For the first time in my life,
{62884}{62944}I felt my heart torn two ways.
{63171}{63204}Give it back!
{63220}{63237}Mustang!
{64507}{64551}I had to hand to that boy.
{64563}{64604}He just wouldn't give up.
{65802}{65846}I'm never gonna ride you, am I?
{65895}{65924}And no one never should.
{66567}{66597}You can go.
{66736}{66759}It's okay, go.
{66934}{66971}Go on, get out of here.
{67013}{67043}Go home.
{68613}{68680}I knew this was hard for her,|and she was scared.
{68705}{68809}But more than anything,|I wanted to share my homeland with her
{74439}{74484}I laid beside her that night.
{74497}{74607}Hoping, praying that somehow|she would be okay.
{74716}{74754}There are a couple|of horses over there!
{75379}{75401}Leave her there.
{75403}{75443}She's not gonna make it.
{76223}{76238}Oh, Rain!
{76319}{76348}Easy, girl. 
{76359}{76400}Easy.
{76459}{76489}It will be okay. 
{76825}{76862}You saved my life.
{77551}{77582}I'm not gonna hurt you.
{77590}{77644}Come on, it's gonna be okay.
{82534}{82574}It'll be alright.
{83224}{83268}I didn't know|why we were brought here.
{83283}{83315}What I did know
{83320}{83419}was we had to find a way to escape,|and get back home.
{83569}{83668}Well, that is it, we're rolling |the steam over the mountain.
{83682}{83733}We got six days to connect to Utah.
{83761}{83797}Move out and gone.
{84563}{84599}Ready to go!
{85751}{85833}We're almost on the top!
{86308}{86364}That was the moment I understood
{86372}{86415}They were headed to my homeland
{86416}{86453}And I had to stop them.
{86545}{86594}Get back!
{86645}{86702}Oh, we got to stop!
{86846}{86869}Hold it!
{87056}{87095}Get the mules up here!
{93161}{93191}I don't know where he came from
{93192}{93221}Or how he got there.
{93240}{93282}But I sure was happy to see him.
{94877}{94898}I don't believe it.
{94943}{94971}Go! Go! Run!
{98020}{98040}Look out!
{98141}{98160}Where are they?
{98162}{98185}There they are!
{98786}{98810}Oh no.
{98894}{98927}Oh yes.
{104393}{104444}You will always be in my heart.
{104812}{104893}Take care of her,|Spirit...
{104916}{104954}Who cannot be broken.
{105432}{105477}I will miss you, my friend.
{105911}{105962}I've been waiting|so long to run free.
{105988}{106059}But that goodbye was harder|than I ever imagined.
{106096}{106139}I will never forget that boy.

Tonight.
So what!
Yes.
Eh...
No... no, no, no...
Wait.
Look.
For you.
No... no, no, no...
Watch out. 
There you go.
Me... here.
There.
Presto... and there you go.
Good evening.
Please.
Let... let me see.
Rabbit... rabbit... [in English]
Ah, rabbit!
Lobster... lobster... [in English]
No, thanks.
Well.
Me... pass pass.
Magic, not magic.
Me... magician.
Well, let me start again. 
Me, this way.
Bye! [in English]
Rabbit? [in English]
Ah, rabbit! 
Enjoy your meal!
Yes.
Ha ha, that's it! Call his agent! [in English]  
Pass pass.
Good evening.
Hello. 
Yes, I wanted to...
No... no, no, no, no. It's over!
To Sophie Tatischeff...
Mommy's going to the beauty parlor, darling.
But I'm leaving you with your favorite friend, Roger.
He is going to take very, very good care of you.
Because if he doesn't, he's going back to the science lab!
P-p-please, don't worry.
Whatever you say.
Yes, ma'am. Aye, aye, sir. Okeydokey.
Why, I'll take care of him like he was my own brother.
Or my own sister.
Or my brother's sister.
Or my second cousin
- who is twice removed.
- Gobble. Cookie.
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times removed from his place outside.
Or like my 15th cousin, who is 16 times removed from my mother's side.
Or like my 27th cousin, who is 37 times...
- Cookie.
- ...removed from my father's side.
Like my 17th cousin, who is
156 times removed from any side!
I'll save you, Baby!
Cookie.
Don't burn yourself,
Baby Herman.
Who turned out the lights?
It's dark in here.
Don't they pay their electricity?
What's happened?
I'll find you, Baby. Where are you?
- Where are you?
- Cookie.
Where'd you go?
What's that smoke?
Cookie.
Cookie.
I'm here, Baby...
Cookie.
Cookie.
- Cut!
- All right. That's it, guys.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
What the hell was wrong with that take?
Nothing with you, Baby Herman.
You were great. You were perfect.
You were better than perfect.
It's Roger! He keeps blowing his lines!
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird?
"A tweeting bird?" Roger, read the script. Look what it says!
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked, rabbit sees stars."
Not birds, stars!
Can we lose the playback, please?
- Roger, you're killing me! Killing me!
- Cut the playback!
For cryin' out loud, Roger!
How many times do we have to do this damn scene?
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer, takin' a nap!
Excuse me, toots.
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess.
Clean this set up! And get him out of there, or seal him up in it!
- Lose the lights! And say "lunch"!
- Lunch!
That's lunch. We're on a half.
P-please, Raoul. I can give you stars!
Just drop the refrigerator on my head one more time!
Roger, I dropped it on your head
23 times already.
- I can take it! Don't worry about me.
- I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about the refrigerator.
I can give you stars. Look. Look!
Look!
Please, Raoul,
I can do it, I swear.
Just give me another chance.
Oh, come on, Raoul.
Toons.
Look! Look, Raoul! Look, Raoul!
Come on, Raoul!
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...
He'll be right with you.
No, no, no!
Wait until he gets to his feet.
- Then hit him with the boulder.
- Right, R. K.
How much do you know about show business, Mr. Valiant?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah, and there's no business more expensive.
I'm 25 grand over budget on the latest Baby Herman cartoon.
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.
He can't keep his mind on the work.
You know why?
One too many refrigerators dropped on his head?
Nah, he's a Toon.
You can drop anything you want on his head. He'll shake it off.
But break his heart, he goes to pieces, just like you or me.
Read that.
"Seen cooing over calamari with not-so-new sugar daddy,"
"was Jessica Rabbit, wife of Maroon Cartoon star Roger."
What's this got to do with me?
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.
Look, I don't have time for this.
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.
I want you to follow her, get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.
- Forget it. I don't work Toontown.
- What's wrong with Toontown?
Every Joe loves Toontown.
Then get Joe to do the job,
'cause I ain't goin'.
Fella.
You don't want to go to Toontown, you don't have to go to Toontown.
Nobody said you had to go to Toontown anyway.
Have a seat, Valiant.
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint called the Ink and Paint Club.
"Toon Revue."
Strictly humans only, okay?
So what do you think, Valiant?
Well?
The job's gonna cost you
100 bucks, plus expenses.
A hundred bucks?
- That's ridiculous!
- So's the job.
All right, all right.
You got your 100 bucks.
- Have a drink, Eddie.
- I don't mind if I do.
- I got it.
- Careful, Dave.
- I got it!
- Dave, you're gonna drop it!
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're droppin' it!
Watch it! Oh, no! Jeez!
Come on!
Kind of jumpy, aren't you, Valiant?
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.
I got him on loan from Disney, him and half the cast of Fantasia.
The best part is they work for peanuts.
Well, I don't work for peanuts.
Where's the other 50?
Let's call the other 50 a carrot to finish the job.
You've been hanging around rabbits too long.
W-Whoop! Whoop!
W-w-
Oh, excuse me!
Please, help. Oh, I'm sorry.
Get out of my way!
Oh, taxi? Oh, cab?
Right here! Right here!
What do I look like, a bank?
Wait for me!
- Come on!
- Guys, wait up!
- Come on, hurry up! Come on, Sig!
- Hurry up!
- Hey, mister, ain't you got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?
We got the best public transportation system in the world.
- Hey, so long.
- See you later!
- So long, mister!
- Thanks for the cigarettes.
- You bet.
- Anytime.
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, Eddie. How's it going?
Okay. What you got for me?
The usual bills.
Hey, give back my ball!
Hello, fella.
- Hi, Harry. Are you okay?
- Hey.
What's with Earl?
- Laid off?
- A new outfit bought the Red Car.
Some big company called Cloverleaf.
No kiddin'. They bought the Red Car?
Yeah, and put the poor guy on two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.
Oh, well.
Here's to the pencil pushers.
May they all get lead poisoning?
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie. You know what happens here on Friday?
- Fish special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,
I'm gonna lose my job.
Don't bust a button, Dolores.
You've only got one left.
50 bucks?
Where's the rest?
Well, it's only a snoop job away.
You got that camera of yours?
Mine's in the shop.
Wouldn't be the pawn shop by any chance, would it?
Oh, come on, Dolores.
You need the other 50.
I need the camera.
Any film in there?
Should be.
I haven't had that roll developed since our trip to Catalina.
- That sure was a long time ago.
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.
- Let's do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.
- That paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.
R. K. Maroon, as in Maroon Cartoons?
Maroon Cartoons?
Hey. So who's your client,
Mr. Detective-To-The-Stars?
Chilly Willy?
Or Screwy Squirrel?
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.
So what happened?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?
Cut it out, Angelo.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I know.
You're working for Little Bo Peep.
She's lost her sheep and you're gonna help her find them.
Hey?
Get this straight, meatball.
I don't work for Toons!
So what's his problem?
- A Toon killed his brother.
- What?
Dropped a piano on his head.
Got the password?
Walt sent me.
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.
All right.
Hey, look at that!
Hey! Hey! Cut it out!
Does anybody understand what this duck is saying?
- Most amusing.
- A little more wine.
I've worked with a lot of wise quackers, but you are despicable.
Doggone stubborn nitwit!
That did it!
This is the last time I work with someone with a speech impediment.
Oh, yeah?
This means war.
- What, you think that's funny?
- It's a panic.
You won't think it's funny when I stick that pen up your nose.
Now, calm down, son, will ya? Look, the stain's gone. It's disappearing ink.
No hard feelings, I hope.
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- I know who you are.
Marvin Acme, the guy that owns Toontown. The gag king.
If it's Acme, it's a gasser.
Put it there, pal.
The hand buzzer.
It's still our biggest seller.
Scotch on the rocks.
And I mean ice!
This is hot stuff!
Hey, those ducks are funny.
They never get to finish the act!
Great. Thanks.
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?
Long time no see.
What are you doing here?
Work's been kinda slow since cartoons went to color.
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop-boop-be-doop, boop!
Yeah, you still got it.
What's with him?
Mr. Acme never misses a night when Jessica performs.
Got a thing for rabbits?
You had plenty money
In 1922
You let other women
Make a fool of you
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?
Get out of here
Give me some money too
She's married to Roger Rabbit?
Yeah. What a lucky girl.
Now if you had prepared
20 years ago
You wouldn't be wanderin' now
From door to door
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?
Get out of here
Give me some money too
Get out of here
Give me some money too
Why don't you do right
Like some other men
Do?
Who is it?
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.
You sure murdered 'em again tonight, baby.
I really mean it.
My darling, you were superb.
You absolutely, truly and honestly
"fashmolyed" that audience.
You killed them. You slayed them.
You belted them into little pieces.
What do you think you're doin', chump?
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?
And don't let me catch your peepin' face around here again!
Got it?
Ooga-booga!
Come, my dear Jessica.
Come over here.
I got everything arranged, right here on the bed.
Oh, not tonight, Marvin.
I have a headache.
Oh, Jessica, you promised.
Oh, all right.
But this time, take off that hand buzzer.
Patty-cake.
Patty-cake.
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin.
Patty-cake.
- Marvin.
- Patty-cake.
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
I don't believe it!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Is that true?
Take comfort, son.
You're not the first man whose wife played patty-cake on him.
I just don't believe it.
I won't believe it. I can't believe it.
I shan't believe it.
Believe it, kid.
I took the pictures myself.
She played patty-cake.
No, not my Jessica. Not patty-cake.
This is impossible.
I don't believe it. It can't be!
It just can't be! Jessica's my wife!
It's absolutely impossible!
Jessica's the light of my life, the apple of my eye, the cream in my coffee!
You better start drinking it black,
'cause Acme's taking the cream now.
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for 30 years.
Who would've thought he was a sugar daddy?
Somebody must have made her do it!
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.
Thanks. I needed that.
Son of a bitch.
Look, Mr. Maroon.
I think my work here is finished.
How about that carrot you owe me?
- A deal's a deal.
- Great.
Thanks.
Roger, I know all this seems pretty painful now, but you'll find someone new.
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.
Good-looking guy like that.
The dames will be breaking his door down.
Dames? What dames?
Jessica is the only one for me!
You'll see! We'll rise above this piddling peccadillo!
We're going to be happy again!
You got that? Happy.
Capital H-A-P-P-I...
Well, at least he took it well.
Oh, Jessica!
Please tell me it's not true.
P-p-please!
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.
Where'd you come from?
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money so bad, why didn't you come to me?
So I took a couple of dirty pictures. So kill me.
I already got a stiff on my hands, thank you.
Marvin Acme.
The rabbit cacked him last night.
What?
Now what?
It's just I haven't been this close to Toontown for a while.
Yeeow!
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch!
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.
I didn't see anything.
Maybe you heard a noise or something.
- He's with me.
- Nothin'.
- Are you sure?
- Come on, kid.
Are you sure you didn't see anything?
- What about you, fella?
- I didn't see anything.
- I came in to work.
- Come on, Lieutenant.
Just like a Toon to drop a safe on a guy's head.
Sorry, Eddie.
You better wait here, all right?
You got a positive I. D.?
Must be.
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.
You've seen one of these?
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?
Or did you change your name to Jack Daniels?
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.
Mr. Valiant?
I hope you're proud of yourself and those pictures you took.
For crying out loud, Mike!
Hey, we need a little help over here!
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!
Hey, Mike, come here!
I got these. Come on. Come on.
Those shoes over there.
Is this man removing evidence from the scene of a crime?
No, Judge Doom. Valiant here was just pickin' it up for you.
Weren't you, Eddie?
- Hand it over.
- Sure.
His number-one seller.
I see working for a Toon has rubbed off on you.
I wasn't working for a Toon.
I was working for R. K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.
He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures.
The rabbit said, one way or another, he and his wife were going to be happy.
Is that true?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's in charge.
That's all right, Lieutenant.
From the smell of him,
I'd say it was the booze talking.
No matter. The rabbit won't get far.
My men will find him.
Look out!
- Weasels?
- Yes.
I find they have a special gift for the work.
All right, ya mugs. Fall out.
- Did you find the rabbit?
- Don't worry, Judge.
We've got "deformants" all over the city. We'll find him.
You wouldn't have any idea where the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?
I hear Kokomo's very nice this time of the year.
I'm surprised you're not more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.
A human has been murdered by a Toon.
Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that?
Since I've had Toontown under my jurisdiction, my goal has been to reign in the insanity.
And the only way to do that is to make Toons respect the law.
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?
He spread a bunch of simoleons around Toontown a couple years back, bought the election.
Yeah? What's that?
Remember how we always thought there wasn't a way to kill a Toon?
- Yeah.
- Well, Doom found a way.
Turpentine, acetone, benzene.
- He calls it "the dip."
- I'll catch the rabbit, Mr. Valiant.
Then I'll try him, convict him and execute him.
That's one dead shoe, boss?
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
But this is how we handle things down in Toontown.
I'd think you, of all people, would appreciate that.
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!
I've been tryin' to make him quit, but he just won't listen to me.
What do you know, you dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. of a rattle.
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.
I wanna talk to you about the Acme murder. Hey, doll.
Why don't you run downstairs and get me a racin' form?
Okay, okay. I'm goin'.
The lady's man?
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust in a 3-year-old dinky.
Yeah, must be tough.
Look, Valiant, the rabbit didn't kill Acme.
He's not a murderer. I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine.
I tell ya, Valiant, the whole thing stinks like yesterday's diapers.
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.
That's a load of succotash.
Every Toon knows Acme had a will.
He promised to leave Toontown to us Toons.
That will is the reason he got bumped off.
Has anybody ever seen this will?
No, but he gave us his solemn oath.
If you believe that that joker could do anything solemn, the gag's on you, pal.
I just figured since you were the one who got my pal in trouble, you might want to help get him out.
I can pay you.
Save your money for a pair of elevator shoes!
Wait, no! Valiant, no! Oh, my stogie!
It ain't my fault the rabbit got himself in trouble.
All I did was take a couple of lousy pictures.
Baby was right.
The hell with it.
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.
I thought it would be best if I waited inside, seein' as how I'm wanted for murder!
No kiddin'. Just talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?
Nobody. Not a soul except...
- Who?
- Well, you see...
I didn't know where your office was, so I asked the newsboy.
He didn't know, so I asked the fireman, the green grocer, the butcher, the baker.
They didn't know.
But the liquor store guy, he knew.
In other words, the whole damn town knows you're here!
- Get out of here! Come on. Out!
- Hey, take it easy, will ya?
- Out! Get out! Come on.
- Please, Eddie, don't throw me out!
- You're making a big mistake!
- Get out of here!
- I didn't kill anybody! I swear!
- Let go of that door, will ya?
This whole thing's a setup, a scam, a frame job.
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody.
My whole purpose in life is to make people laugh!
Okay, okay. Sure, I admit it.
I got a little steamed when you showed me those pictures of Jessica, so I rushed over to the Ink and Paint Club.
But she wasn't in her dressing room, so I wrote her a love letter.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy, you wrote your wife a love letter?
That's right. I know that she was just an innocent victim of circumstance.
I suppose you used the old lipstick on the mirror routine?
Lipstick, yes. Mirror, no.
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways."
"One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand..."
Why didn't you just leave the letter there?
Obviously, a poem of this power and sensitivity must... be read in person, so I went home to wait for her.
But the weasels were there, waiting for me.
So... So I ran.
So why come to me? I'm the guy that took the pictures of your wife.
Yeah, and you're also the guy that helped all these Toons.
Everybody knows, when a Toon's in trouble, there's only one place to go,
Valiant and Valiant.
Not anymore.
Get out of that chair!
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah. Where is your brother anyway?
He looks like a sensitive and sober fellow.
- That's it. I'm callin' the cops.
- Go ahead. Call the cops.
I come here for help, and what do you do?
You turn me in.
No, no, don't feel guilty about me.
So long, and thanks for nothin'.
That's the closet! Stupe.
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.
Get out!
Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.
Yah!
Come on. Get the lead out.
Move it, would ya? Move it!
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!
Hide me, Eddie. P-p-please!
- Remember. You never saw me.
- Get out of there!
Don't let 'em find me!
Come on, Eddie. You're my only hope.
Open up in the name of the law!
- That's us.
- P-p-please, Eddie.
You know there's no justice for Toons anymore.
- If the weasels get their hands on me...
- Are you in there?
- I'm as good as dipped.
- Don't make us play rough, Valiant.
We just want the rabbit.
What are we gonna do, Eddie?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.
It looks like they gave us the slip, boss?
Nah. Valiant's got him stashed somewhere.
Hold it right there.
Hello, boys. I didn't hear you come in.
Okay, wise guy. Where's the rabbit?
I haven't seen him.
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.
Sheesh, Valiant.
Search the place, boys.
And leave no stone unturned.
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable tip-off the rabbit was here, and it was "corrugated" by several others.
So cut the "bullshtick."
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.
Stop that laughin'!
You know what happens when ya can't stop laughin'!
One of these days, you're gonna die laughin'.
As for you, Valiant, step out of line, and we'll hang you and your laundry out to dry.
Come on, boys. Let's "am-scray."
- They're gone.
- Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.
You saved my life.
How can I ever repay ya?
Blecch! For starters, don't ever kiss me again!
Stop kicking me. Stop kicking me.
Dolores. Dolores!
Dolores!
Hey, Eddie, you made the front page today.
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.
Come on, Eddie. Just let's go. Please!
So tell me, Eddie.
Is that a rabbit in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.
- I gotta get out of these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.
Jeepers, Eddie, that almost killed me!
Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?
It's a rotgut room.
A holdover from Prohibition.
Oh, I get it. A speakeasy, a gin mill, a hooch parlor.
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!
It's a spy hole!
Jeepers, Eddie!
This would be a great place to hide!
- Crazy Toon.
- Watch your head!
I thought you said you'd never take another Toon case.
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothing's changed.
Somebody's made a patsy out of me, and I'm going to find out why.
Hold still, will ya?
- Does this help?
- Yeah. Thanks.
You mean to tell me that you could have taken your hand out of that cuff at any time?
No, not at any time.
Only when it was funny.
Get out!
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?
He always this funny, or only on days when he's wanted for murder?
Listen, my philosophy is this.
If you don't have a good sense of humor, you're better off dead.
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.
- What is it, Eddie?
- Just look at it.
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah.
And I think Maroon played the part of sound mind and your wife the sound body.
Why, I resent that innuendo!
- What's the scheme, Eddie?
- I don't think they got to the will.
But how do you know?
Because they were still looking for it after they killed him.
Anything I can do?
Maybe you can go downtown and check the probate.
Yeah, check the probate!
Why, my Uncle Thumper had a problem with his probate, and he had to take these big pills and drink lots of water.
- Not prostate, you idiot. Probate!
- Let me get this straight.
You think that my boss, R. K. Maroon dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head so that he could get his hands on Toontown?
Yeah.
That's my hunch.
Can he stay here for a couple of days?
He's not gonna do anything crazy, is he?
- Where are you going?
- Back to the office.
Mr. Valiant. Mr. Valiant?
You've got the wrong idea about me, Mr. Valiant.
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price and I'll pay it.
Yeah, I bet you would.
You've gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.
You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well.
You don't know how hard it is being a man looking at a woman, looking the way you do.
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.
Weren't you the one I caught playing patty-cake with old man Acme?
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.
- What are you talking about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.
I didn't want to have anything to do with it, but he said if I didn't pose for those patty-cake pictures,
Roger would never work in this town again.
I couldn't let that happen.
I'd do anything for my husband, Mr. Valiant.
- Anything.
- What a wife.
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?
Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?
Well.
Sorry.
Good-bye, Eddie. My offer stands firm.
Think about it.
Well!
Do you want to tell me what she was doing with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!
Yeah, but I... Dolores, come...
Come on, Dolores.
You don't believe a painted hussy like that could turn my head.
She's just trying to get her hands on the rabbit.
That's not all she's trying to get her hands on.
Now, look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.
Look, I want you to go out, I want you to buy yourself a new swim suit,
'cause you and me are going to Catalina.
I'm on the verge of wrappin' up this case.
No, you're not, Eddie.
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.
Maroon's not after Toontown like you thought.
It's Cloverleaf that wants to get their hands on Toontown.
They put in the highest bid.
And unless Mr. Acme's will shows up by midnight tonight,
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.
- What? At midnight tonight?
- That's right.
First they buy the Red Car, then they want to get their hands on Toontown.
I don't get it.
Yes!
Roger!
The rabbit. Get the judge.
A joke don't sit there on your brain
Nice shirt.
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?
My buddy's Eddie V
A sourpuss, you'll see
But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'cause a joker he will be
C, D, E, F, G
H, I... I would love to raise some Cain
Believe me, it's no strain
It feels so great 'cause I'm so tight
And look, there is no pain
No pain. No pain. No pain
No pain. No pain. No...
- No!
- Hey, wait!
Yah!
Hey, who turned out the lights?
I can't see a thing! What's goin' on?
You crazy rabbit!
I've been out there risking my neck for you, and what are you doin'?
Singin' and dancin'!
But I'm a Toon. Toons are supposed to make people laugh.
Sit down!
You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.
Yeah, and when they're done laughin', they'll call the cops!
That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel.
Not Angelo! He'd never turn me in.
Why? Because you made him laugh?
That's right.
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.
Why, sometimes in life, it's the only weapon we have.
Laughter is the most...
"Ixnay." "Ix-nay."
I'm looking for a murderer.
A rabbit.
A Toon rabbit.
About yea big.
Look.
There's no rabbit here, so don't harass my customers.
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.
Hey. I seen a rabbit.
Where?
See?
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.
Say "hello," Harvey.
I told you so.
The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.
Quite a loony selection for a group of drunken reprobates.
He's here!
Stop that laughing!
Have you forgotten what happened last time?
If you don't stop this laughing, you're gonna end up dead, just like your idiot hyena cousins!
Say, boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?
No, Sergeant. Disassembling the place won't be necessary.
The rabbit is going to come right to me.
No Toon can resist the old Shave and a Haircut trick.
I don't know who's toonier, you or Doom.
Roger!
Ro... Roger.
Roger, no!
Roger, don't...
Shave and a haircut
Two bits
Hey, Judge, what should we do with the wallflower?
We'll see to him later.
Right now I feel like dispensing some justice.
Bring me some dip.
Does the condemned have anything to say before his sentence is carried out?
Why, yeah. I...
Dolores, a bourbon, and make it a double.
A fine time for a drink, Eddie.
Maybe you'd like a bowl of pretzels to go with it!
Pour the drink, Dolores.
Hey, Judge!
Doesn't a dying rabbit deserve a last request?
Yeah! Nose plugs would be nice.
I think you want a drink.
- How 'bout it, Judge?
- Well, why not.
I don't mind prolonging the execution.
Happy trails.
No, thanks, Eddie.
I'm tryin' to cut down.
- Drink the drink!
- But I don't want the drink.
He doesn't want the drink.
- He does! You do!
- I don't!
- I don't! I don't!
- You do!
- You do! You don't.
- I don't!
- I do!
- You don't!
Listen, when I say "I do," that means I do!
Come on.
Gotcha, kid.
Come on, Eddie, let's get out of here!
Move it, pops! Yikes!
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.
Nothing like using the old spine flower,
- the wise noodle, the smart puddin'.
- Roger!
- Yikes! Stop, will ya?
- Let's use this!
Yah!
Let's get out of here!
What are you waitin' for?
There's no damn key!
Hey, you weasels, let me out of here, will ya? Come on!
- I've got to make a livin'!
- Benny, is that you?
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.
Come on, Roger! Get me out of here!
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride!
Open the doors!
That's better.
I can't believe they locked me up for driving on the sidewalk.
Come on, Eddie. Get in!
- It was just a couple of miles.
- I'll drive!
- But I wanna drive!
- No, I'll drive!
I'm the cab. Out of my way, pencil neck!
How about this weather?
- It never rains!
- Would you beat it!
They've sprung the cab! Let's go!
And how about those
Brooklyn Dodgers?
Are they bums, or what?
Move over. I'm drivin'!
Benny, Eddie, we got company!
Will you look at these two?
Excuse me, ladies!
Now that's what I call a couple of road hogs.
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Benny, look out for the Red Car!
Benny, there's cops right behind us!
Not for long, Roger.
- No!
- Now they're right in front of us.
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around.
Give me the wheel. Give me the wheel!
- The cops are still on our tail!
- I know the cops are on our tail!
What do you think I am? Benny!
No. No!
Pull the lever!
- Which one?
- Which one?
Which one?
I'm gonna ram 'em.
What the heck?
I'm gettin' too old for this!
Jumpin' jeepers!
Hey, Roger, what do you call the middle of a song?
I don't know. A bridge!
- Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?
- Yeah. Somewhere we can hide.
I got just the place. And incidentally, if you should ever need a ride, just stick out your thumb.
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Boy, did you see that?
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.
What timing, what finesse!
What a genius!
Ouch!
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
You're the only person in this theater that isn't laughing.
Is there nothing that can permeate your impervious puss?
Hey, Eddie! Boy, nothin'.
What could've possibly happened to you to turn you into such a sourpuss?
You want to know? I'll tell you.
- A Toon killed my brother.
- A Toon? No.
That's right. A Toon.
We were investigating a robbery at the First National Bank of Toontown.
Back in those days, me and Teddy liked working Toontown.
We thought it was a lot of laughs.
Anyway, this guy got away with a zillion simoleons.
We trailed him to a little dive down on Yockster Street.
We went in.
Only he got the drop on us, literally.
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.
Broke my arm.
Teddy never made it.
I never did find out who that guy was.
All I remember was, he was standin' over me, laughin', with those burnin' red eyes and that high, squeaky voice.
He disappeared into Toontown after that.
No wonder you hate me.
If a Toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too!
Come on, don't cry. I don't hate you.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.
You do hate me.
Otherwise you wouldn't have yanked my ears all those times.
Well, I'm sorry I yanked your ears.
All the times you yanked my ears?
- All the times I yanked your ears.
- Apology accepted.
Put 'er there, pal. I feel better. Oh, boy!
I hope it's another cartoon!
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.
I hate the news.
- Did you get all my stuff?
- Yes.
It's all packed up in the car outside.
Would have been here right after you called, but I had to shake the weasels.
Yeah. I'm sorry about the trouble in the bar.
Oh, hell. Stuffing olives for a living wasn't for me anyway.
Dolores?
You oughta find yourself a good man.
But I already have a good man.
P-p-please, don't mind me.
You better get going, Eddie.
A near miss, but this miss says that's as good as a smile.
California Cloverleaf...
Glad Teddy's not here to see me running away with my tail between my legs.
It's not so bad once you get used to it.
The Pacific Red Car trolley line and the venerated
Maroon Cartoon Studios.
Here, R.K. Maroon is seen clinching the deal with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs in one of the biggest real estate deals ever in California history.
- That's it!
- Three-and-a-half million dollars...
That's the connection!
Let's forget it.
There's nobody here.
- Is that it, or are you scared?
- P-p-please! Me, scared?
Don't be ridiculous.
When you called Maroon, you told him you had the will, but you don't.
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.
He might try to kill ya.
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.
I just don't want the odds to change.
Now, you cover my back.
And if you hear or see anything, beep the horn twice.
Yeah, that's it. Beep the horn twice.
Cover your back.
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up, eyes peeled, ears to the ground.
Why, nobody gets the drop on Roger Rabbit.
What's up, Doc?
Valiant, what are you trying to do, give me a heart attack?
You need a heart before you can have an attack.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the will?
Sure. I got the will.
The question is, do you have the way?
'Cause I can tell you now, it ain't gonna come cheap.
You got a lot of brass coming up here by yourself.
Who said I'm here by myself?
Let me see that will.
- I told you, I got it.
- I want to see it now!
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No, this is.
Get up! Come on.
What are you gonna do to me, Valiant?
I'm gonna listen to you spin the Cloverleaf scenario.
A story of greed, sex and murder.
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.
You got it all wrong!
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!
Everybody's got to have a hobby.
Oh, stop it. Stop it! Stop it!
The truth is, I had a chance to sell my studio, but Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property unless Acme sold them his.
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell, so I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Blackmail, that's all!
I've been around Toons all my life!
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed? Why?
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.
Unless Acme's will shows by midnight tonight,
Toontown's going to be live for the free...
Roger!
- What the...
- Yeah, what in Sam Hill...
Eddie Valiant!
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes!
I ain't seen you in nigh on to five years.
- Where've you been?
- Drunk.
- You feeling frisky tonight, fellas?
- Yeah!
Let's go.
Yahoo!
Smile, darn ya, smile
You know, this old world is a great world after all
Smile, darn ya, smile
And right away watch lady luck pay you a call
Things are never black as they are painted
Time for you and joy to get acquainted
Hi, Eddie!
Hi, Eddie! Hi, Eddie! Bye, Eddie!
Tallyho! Tallyho!
Get out of here!
Going up, sir.
Yah!
Mind the step, sir.
Hold on, sir.
Yah!
Your floor, sir.
Have a good day, sir.
Gotcha.
A man!
Lover boy! It's Lena Hyena!
Oh, no!
- Oh, "wook," piggies.
- Hi, Tweety.
This "wittle" piggy went to market.
This "wittle" piggy stayed home.
- No.
- This "wittle" piggy had roast beef.
And this "wittle" piggy had...
Ran out of piggies.
Yah!
What's up, Doc? Jumpin' without a parachute? Kinda dangerous, ain't it?
Yeah.
Yeah. You could get killed.
- You guys got a spare?
- Bugs does.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but I don't think you want it.
- I do! I do! Give it to me!
- Better let him have it, Bugs.
Okay, Doc. Whatever you say.
Here's the spare.
Thank you.
No!
- Poor fella.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?
My man!
Come to Lena!
Toons. Gets 'em every time.
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.
Valiant?
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.
Behind you!
Drop it, lady!
I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
- I don't trust anybody or anything!
- Not even your own eyes?
That's the gun that killed R. K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him.
That's right!
You'll never stop me!
- You're dead! You're both dead!
- Doom!
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, he went that-a-way.
- Let's go!
Dum-dums.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
- Oh, no. Where's Roger?
- Roger?
He chickened out on me back at the studio.
No, he didn't.
I hit him on the head with a frying pan and put him in the trunk so he wouldn't get hurt.
Makes perfect sense.
We're obviously not going anywhere in my car.
Let's take yours.
I got a feeling somebody already did.
From the looks of it,
I'd say it was Roger.
My honey bunny was never very good behind the wheel.
- A better lover than a driver?
- You'd better believe it, buster.
It's the weasels. This way!
- We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait! No, no!
Gingerbread Lane's this way.
So, Valiant, you call a cab, or what?
Hubba-hubba-hubba.
Allow me, mademoiselle.
So how long have you known it was Doom?
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed, he confided in me that Doom wanted to get his hands on Toontown, and he wouldn't stop at anything.
So he gave you the will for safekeeping.
That's what he told me.
Except when I opened the envelope, there was only a blank piece of paper inside.
- A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?
- My meter's runnin'!
- I have to find my darling husband.
I'm so worried about him.
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?
He makes me laugh.
I've been dipped!
What an unfortunate accident. Nothing more treacherous than a slippery road especially when driving in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Good work, boss.
Don't just stand there. Help them.
- Put them in my car.
- Follow me.
And I think they'll enjoy attending the ribbon cutting at the Acme Factory.
Come on, you mugs.
We searched Valiant, boss.
The will ain't on him.
- Then frisk the woman!
- I'll handle this one.
Nice booby trap.
Do they have the will, or not?
- Nah, just a stupid love letter.
- No matter.
I doubt if that will is gonna show up in the next 15 minutes anyway.
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine.
Lock, stock and barrel.
Benny, is that you?
No, it's Shirley Temple!
Jumpin' jeepers! What happened?
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant and took 'em to the Acme Factory.
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in!
Move over, Rog. You've done enough driving for one night.
Toontown right on the other side of the wall, boss.
You see, Mr. Valiant, the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtains on my career as a jurist in Toontown.
I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries by any chance?
You're looking at the sole stockholder.
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.
This is no way to make a livin'.
Wouldn't you know. Locked.
Can you guess what this is?
Oh, my God! It's dip!
That's right, my dear. Enough to dip
Toontown off the face of the Earth!
A vehicle of my own design.
5,000 gallons of heated dip pumped at enormous velocity through a pressurized water cannon.
Toontown will be erased in a matter of minutes.
I suppose you think no one's going to notice
Toontown's disappeared?
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 miles an hour?
What are you talking about?
There's no road past Toontown.
Not yet! Several months ago,
I had the good providence to stumble upon this plan of the city council's.
A construction plan of epic proportions.
They're calling it a freeway.
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?
Eight lanes of shimmering cement running from here to Pasadena.
Smooth, safe, fast.
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.
So that's why you killed
Acme and Maroon? For this freeway?
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.
I see a place where people get on and off the freeway.
On and off, off and on, all day and all night!
Soon, where Toontown once stood will be a string of gas stations, inexpensive motels, restaurants that serve rapidly prepared food, tire salons, automobile dealerships, and wonderful, wonderful billboards reaching as far as the eye can see!
- My God, it'll be beautiful.
- Come on!
Nobody's gonna drive this lousy freeway when they can take the Red Car for a nickel.
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to.
You see, I bought the Red Car so I could dismantle it.
What the...
Ay, caramba!
Okay, nobody move!
All right, weasels, grab some sky or I'll let the judge have it!
- You heard me. I said, drop it.
- Roger, darling!
Yes, it's me, my dearest.
I'd love to embrace you, but first I have to satisfy my sense of moral outrage!
Put the gun down, you bucktoothed fool!
That's it, Doom! Give me another excuse to pump you full of lead!
You thought you could get away with it, didn't ya?
We Toons may act idiotic, but we're not stupid!
We demand justice, but the real meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks!
Roger!
- Roger, say something!
- Look, stars!
Ready when you are, Raoul.
Tie the lovebirds together.
Come on, lovebirds. What you want?
Put them up on that hook.
Use that escape-proof Toon rope.
Time to kill the rabbit.
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.
I've loved you more than any woman's ever loved a rabbit.
It's over, Mr. Valiant.
- Look out, you fools!
- Not so fast.
One of these days, you idiots are gonna laugh yourselves to death!
Shall I "repose" of him right now, boss?
Let him watch his Toon friends get dipped, then shoot him.
With pleasure.
Everything's funny to you, ain't it, needle nose?
You got a problem with that, Valiant?
Nah.
I just want you to know something about the guy you're gonna dip!
Now Roger is his name
Laughter is his game
Come on, you dope, untie his rope and watch him go insane
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.
This singing ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme
If I get stuck
I'm... I'm out of luck...
- I'm running out of time!
- Thanks!
Hey, Eddie, keep it up!
You're killin' 'em!
You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!
I'm through with taking falls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the...
- Nose!
- Nose? That don't rhyme with "walls"!
No, but this does!
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!
Jeepers, that was close!
Bye-bye!
Eddie, hurry! It's coming back!
- Oh, no!
- This is it!
This isn't it!
Wicked witchcraft
And although I know
It's strictly taboo
When...
Don't move.
No. No!
Yah!
Oh, no!
Come on, Eddie! Quit playing around!
- P-p-please!
- Help!
I wasn't worried. Were you?
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!
Holy smoke! He's a Toon!
- Surprised?
- Not really.
That lamebrain freeway idea could only be cooked up by a Toon.
Not just any Toon!
Remember me, Eddie?
When I killed your brother, I talked just like this!
Jumpin' jeepers.
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!
Good-bye, my darling. Good-bye!
I think I'm gonna faint.
Oh, no!
I'm melting!
I'm melting! Melting!
Eddie! Do something!
Hurry up, Eddie!
Do something!
Eddie, there's dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close shave.
I thought for sure our goose was cooked!
My hero.
- Oh, honey bunny.
- Oh, love cup.
Oh, Roger, you were a pillar of strength.
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?
I've been a cab for 37 years and I've never seen a mess like this!
What was that, a rubber mask?
Yeah.
And this is the rope from the safe that was dropped on Acme.
I think your lab boys will find that paint's a perfect match.
- Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.
- And R. K. Maroon.
And my brother.
That's what I call one seriously disturbed Toon.
I wonder who he really was.
I'll tell you one thing, Doc.
He weren't no rabbit.
- Or a duck.
- Or a dog.
- Or a little wooden boy.
- Or a sheep.
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.
- What's that? What is that?
- It's ink.
That goof Acme squirted me with some the other night.
- Why it's coming out now, I don't know.
- Here's your answer, Eddie.
Acme Disappearing Reappearing Ink.
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!
If he was such a genius, why didn't he leave his will where we could find it?
Without it, we're just waitin' for another developer's wrecking ball!
- Roger.
- Yeah?
That love letter you wrote to your wife in the Ink and Paint Club.
Why don't you read it to her now?
Sure, Eddie.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?"
"Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body..."
- It's the will!
- Give me!
"Do hereby bequeath in perpetuity"
"the property known as Toontown"
"to those lovable characters, the Toons!"
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty funny dance you did for the weasels.
Do you think your days of being a sourpuss are over?
- Only time will tell.
- Yeah. Well, put it there, pal.
Yeah.
Don't tell me you lost your sense of humor already.
Does this answer your question?
Blech! Bleah!
Come on, Roger, let's go home.
I'll bake you a carrot cake.
Smile, darn ya, smile
You know, this old world is a great world after all
Smile, darn ya, smile
And right away watch lady luck pay you a call
Things are never black as they are painted
Time for you and joy to get acquainted
Okay, m-m-move along.
T-T-There's nothing else to see.
That's all, folks.
I like the sound of that.
T-T-T-T-That's all, folks!
My friends, this is Paris.
Gay, beautiful, wonderful, magnificent Paris.
Paris: The tender mother of romance.
Of love. Of amour.
But not all the love stories of France begin in Paris. No, no, no.
There was one, for example, a quite unusual one that began in the hot...
...sun-drenched region in the south of France...
...in the province known as Provence.
The time is around the turn of the century.
You call it the Gay Nineties, no?
But that is beside the point.
This is the story of a little female citizen of France...
...who is as beautiful and as innocent as her name.
And her name is Mewsette.
No last name. Just Mewsette.
Hello, Jaune Tom.
Hello, Mewsette.
That was a very nice song you were singing, Jaune Tom.
- Please sing some more for me.
- Mewsette...
...you know I can't sing it when you're looking at me.
Amour, amour...
...a- mush.
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
Jaune Tom, you're wonderful.
Jaune Tom!
A moose! A moose!
I mean, a mouse.
It's as big as a moose.
- I mean, it's a whopper.
- A mouse?
Where? Where?
At the barn. Hurry! Hurry!
Come on, let's go!
Jaune Tom, you're a...
...clumsy country clod.
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!
Hey, Jaune Tom.
What are we going to do with our mouse?
We'll wrap it as a gift and give it to Mewsette.
Mewsette...
That's all I ever hear around this place.
But, my dear sister, how can you continue to bury yourself on this farm?
I like it here, Jeunesse, chérie.
I choose to live here.
And now, tell me about this friend of yours in Paris.
- Is he nice?
- My dear sister, what manners.
So polished.
Not at all like the plebeian peasants you would meet out here.
The peasants, they are good and honest...
...and very happy.
Happy, on this pile of dust?
How can you allow yourself to go to seed like a fat duck?
- Ducks don't go to seed, my dear sister.
- Well, like a vegetable then.
That's what you are, Marie:
A cabbage, an artichoke.
True, Jeunesse, and vegetables are happiest on farms.
But, darling, think of Paris.
Lovely, gay Paris.
Have you forgotten the sidewalk cafes and how we sipped champagne?
Champagne. That must be what they call catnip in Paris.
How nice.
The button champignons sauteed in butter with tiny shreds of ham.
Champignons.
I know what they are. Mushrooms!
And delicious too.
- And, my dear, the Champs Elysees.
- Champs Elysées?
- I wonder what they taste like.
- Oh, what a lovely feline.
Too bad her beauty is wasted here.
Now, in Paris, she would be perfumed and curled...
...and have a stunning coiffure.
We would go everywhere in style, wouldn't we, chérie?
The Rivoli, Maxim's, the Place Pigalle...
...boating on the Seine...
...with the music of Paris surrounding and caressing us.
Oh, those nights. So sparkling, so clear, that each star becomes...
...the glittering point of a great blue diamond.
Mewsette!
Hey, Mewsette!
What's the matter?
Are you deaf or something?
No. I am not deaf or something.
Come on, come on.
Read the poem.
Okay, okay.
You don't have to push.
A poem, dedicated to Mewsette.
To Mewsette, the prettiest cat
In all of France
All right, all right.
It's your poem.
Roses are red violets are blue
Here is a mouse from me to you
Signed, Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom! You take that horrid, vulgar thing away from here this minute!
I've never been so insulted.
How dare you think that I would eat such a coarse, plebeian thing.
But...
- But cats like mice.
- Perhaps so.
- But I am not a cat, I'll have you know.
- You're not a...?
- You're not a cat?
- Not a cat?
I am a...
A... feline.
- A feline?
- You're a fe... What?
I think she means a female, Robespierre.
And all felines really like is champagne and champignons...
...and Champs Elysees...
And all I get on this farm is mice and milk!
I feel like a cabbage that's gone to seed. Like a fat duck!
Gosh, Mewsette, you're not as fat as a duck.
Oh, go away, you ple... Ple...
Plebeian peasant, you!
I never want to see you again.
I wish I were dead!
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!
So do we.
Don't we, Jaune Tom?
Jaune Tom?
Jaune Tom?
Now look what you've done, you... You old feline, you!
Plebeians!
Well, if you don't like us "plebleens," why don't you go away with her?
I'll bet she just lives on "cham-pag-ne" and
"cham-pygmy-ons" and "champs-ulysses."
Why, Robespierre, that's a wonderful idea.
That's exactly what I'll do.
I'll go to Paris.
No more mice and milk for me!
Well, bon voyage, Mademoiselle Feline.
Au revoir, Robespierre!
Take good care of Jaune Tom!
What do you know?
She did it!
I must have a way with felines.
We're free! Free!
Free at last!
Well, you're a mouse.
You ought to know.
Why didn't she like you?
Did you ever have any trouble like that with your girl?
Oh. You are a girl.
Well, then tell me something from the girl's point of view.
What's wrong with me?
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
- Where are you, Jaune Tom?
- Over here, Robespierre.
You can come on back now.
Everything's okay.
You mean Mewsette...?
Mewsette'll take the mouse?
No. She's left, Jaune Tom.
Took off.
- Nothing but fun now that Mewsette's gone.
- What do you mean she's gone?
- She just went away in a carriage.
- Carriage?
- What carriage?
- The one that took her to Paris.
- Well, why did she go to Paris?
- All felines go to Paris, I guess.
Come on, Jaune Tom.
Let's go mouse hunting.
Mewsette!
Hey. Wait for me!
Mewsette! Come back, Mewsette!
For the last time, my lad, if your friend arrived in that buggy...
...she has gone to Paris.
All right. I know that, but where's Paris?
What is Paris?
What is Paris?
- Are you mad?
- Is it a school or something for felines?
A school for felines?
- No? Well, a village, maybe?
- Yes.
That is what it is. A little village a mile or two up the tracks.
And now, if you don't mind,
I do have work to do.
Well, thanks a lot.
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
- Pardon me, sir, but did you see...?
- He went thataway.
Gee, thanks. Jaune Tom!
Good morning, Jaune Tom.
Nighty-night.
I can hardly believe it!
I'm really on my way to Paris!
Delightful.
Delightful city, isn't it?
Oh, yes, sir.
Even more beautiful than
I dreamed it would be.
- First trip to Paris?
- Oh, yes.
- Visiting relatives?
- Oh, no.
I just up and decided that I'd vegetated too long on that dreary farm...
...and that every girl should see Paris and Jaune Tom is so dull...
...and I don't know anybody in Paris and it's all so wonderful...
Oh, but you must think I'm terribly bold to talk this way to a stranger.
Not at all. I think your enthusiasm is charming, and I'm not offended.
Oh, thank you.
I just know I'll be happy here.
Of course. But like any big city,
Paris has its pitfalls.
Oh, I realie that.
But after all, I'm...
I'm not exactly a kitten anymore.
I choose my friends very carefully.
And that's very wise, my dear.
Nevertheless, there are still a few unscrupulous characters about.
- Oh, dear me.
- You need a friend, a sponsor.
- Now, l...
- But that would hardly be proper, would it?
Mademoiselle! You cannot be inferring that I would suggest anything improper.
Oh, dear, no. Oh.
Please forgive me. It's just that...
I thought that my sister, one of the most influential cats in Paris...
...might be persuaded to take you under her wing.
Teach you all you need to know, introduce you to society.
But of course, if you would prefer to go it yourself...
...alone in a strange city, by all means.
- Oh, no, please.
- I would love to meet your sister.
- Then it is settled.
Come along, my dear.
Jaune Tom!
What are we doing down here,
Jaune Tom?
Let's go home before something happens to us.
I can't, Robespierre.
I have to find Mewsette.
Well, you look for Mewsette.
I'm gonna look for trains.
Is it much further to your sister's shop, monsieur?
No. It is just a little further along this street.
Yes. Here we are, my dear, the best in all Paris.
"Salon de Beaute Pour Felines.
Mme. Rubens-Chatte."
Meowrice, how nice to see you again.
- This is Mewsette, my dear sister.
- Isn't she pretty?
Any sister of Meowrice is a friend of mine.
Henrietta, you are my sister.
Sister!
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
She is an old dear but a little absent-minded.
Imagine, not even remembering your own brother!
- Yes.
- How silly of me.
Of course I'm his sister.
I've been his sister for years.
Mewsette is new to Paris, dear sister.
I have told her of your wonderful salon...
...where you will make her into the belle of all Paris.
- Of course, dear brother.
- Then she is all yours, Henrietta.
- You know what must be done.
- Now, look here, Meowrice.
It's going to take time and money to make a lady out of this cat.
So this time, I want something in advance.
Don't rush things, my dear.
Just remember, time is on the side of the scoundrel.
- And you are the king of the scoundrels.
- Yes.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some business to attend to.
All right. Now listen carefully.
So I want one of you to keep an eye on that girl at all times.
Is that clear?
As they say,
"Evil is the root of all money."
Money trees, that is.
Big green money trees.
Gosh! We'll never find Paris in all those buildings and things.
- Yeah. There's a lot of them, all right.
- I told you it was a wild-goose chase.
- Come on. Let's go home.
- No, Robespierre.
- I can't go back without Mewsette.
- Well, I can.
So long, Jaune Tom.
I'm gonna miss you, Robespierre.
Take care of yourself.
Take care of myself?
Who's gonna take care of him?
Without me, no telling what'll happen to him.
Alone, friendless, far from home.
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's start looking.
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
- Quiet! Stop that noise!
- Go away, you silly little pussycats.
- Get away from here!
- Scram! Go on!
Leave those cats out of here!
Allez!
I don't know why she ever came to Paris.
I don't know why you ever came to Paris.
Your purr, my dear, it's like a cement mixer.
But that's the way I purred back home on the farm.
Well, it won't do here.
It must be refined, yet seductive.
Like this:
Now try again and put some throat into it.
Stop!
- Oh, stop!
- Oh, I'm sorry, Madame Rubens-Chatte.
Being sorry isn't enough.
Now, look, child.
We don't want to disappoint
Meowrice, do we?
- Oh, no. I'll try very hard this time.
- Good.
Now, let's show him how poised and gracefully...
...we walk with a bowl of milk on our head.
Now walk towards me.
Head erect.
Turn right. Left.
Reverse.
Oh, look out!
Oh, no.
I'm a failure. I'll never be a Parisian.
I'm going back home, back with the peasants...
...where I belong.
- No! No! Stop her! Stop her!
Stop her yourself.
My poor dear.
I know just how you feel.
Wouldn't you like to stroll on the boulevard, stop at a sidewalk cafe?
- And order Champs Elysees, just once.
- Of course, my pet.
Let us be gay.
We shall do the town.
- Do you feel better now, my dear?
- Oh, yes.
Those sidewalk cafes were so much fun.
And Paris is so beautiful!
And I feel so important riding in a buggy and...
Oh, good heavens, Meowrice.
What are they doing?
Oh, them? Why, they are kissing, chérie.
- What's kissing?
- Kissing?
Why, kissing is...
Like rubbing noses.
But do they only kiss in buggies?
Well, if you did away with buggies, you'd stop half the kissing in Paris.
How strange. Why is that?
Because, my naive one, there is nothing so romantic as a buggy ride.
- Here we are.
- Oh! So soon?
- Now, back to your lessons, my dear.
- Goodbye, Meowrice. And thank you!
How foolish I was.
I'll never think of that dull farm again.
I tell you, Jaune Tom, it's hopeless.
Absolutely hopeless.
- She's probably miles from here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose you're right, Robespierre.
- Well, come on then.
- Let's go back to the farm.
- Okay. Okay.
Now you're talking!
Robespierre, look!
Look what it says: "Felines"!
That's what Mewsette said she was.
I'll bet they'd know where she is.
Here we go again.
Jaune Tom!
Help, Jaune Tom!
Jaune Tom! Help!
- Who is it, dearie?
- There's no one here.
No one at all.
Help!
You know, Robespierre, we're seeing parts of Paris that the tourists usually miss.
Let's find our way out of here and get back to that feline place.
"Mr. Henry Phtt, 1411 Sand Box Road...
...Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A."
"Dear Mr. Phtt:
At long last, I have found a bride for you.
With proper schooling now underway...
...she will be the most beautiful and talented cat in the world.
I shall keep you informed of her progress.
Your obedient servant,
Meowrice Percy Beaucoup."
"P.S. I'm afraid that the price we agreed upon...
...must, under the circumstances, be doubled.
There are other suitors."
Well, I'm off to mail this letter.
If you ever decide to marry, boys, marry for love...
...of money.
Jaune Tom, you take that horrid, vulgar thing away from here this minute!
Pardon me, my friend, but that was the most remarkable exhibition...
...of "virtu-mouse-ity"
I've ever witnessed.
- Virtu-what-sity?
- Virtu-mouse-ity.
A little phrase I coined to describe the incredible proficiency...
...you just displayed in apprehending that rodent.
Obviously, it was too small.
Throwing it back was such a noble gesture.
It is an imposition, I know, but it would afford me great pleasure...
...if you would join me for a bite of dinner and perhaps a sip of...
We accept! We accept!
Name's Robespierre, manager of him...
...Jaune Tom, the world's greatest mouser.
And now can we eat?
It would seem to be out of our hands, monsieur.
What'll it be your pleasure you're having, s'il vous plait?
- Milk.
- Milk?
No, no. Let's really live it up big, Jaune Tom.
- Straight cream.
- No, no, messieurs.
On an occasion such as this, we drink champagne.
Champagne, garcon.
Champagne for the greatest mouse catcher in all France...
...and his manager.
One bottle of champagne, hot off the ice.
Hey, it's made out of bubbles.
I just wanna tell you...
...that you're all a wonderful bunch of gentlemen.
Everyone.
I saloosh...
Shaloot...
I salute you!
What a head.
What a head!
Here, what is this?
A turtle, perhaps?
A turtle with a hangover?
A two-headed turtle? Impossible.
Where are you going, turtle?
What do you know?
This is no turtle.
It's just a small, bloodshot kitten.
Oh, gently, gently, shipmate.
I won't harm your little friend.
You see, we three are all in the same boat.
The same boat.
That is pretty funny.
The same boat, no?
Say... No.
No, I guess not.
The truth is, we have been shanghaied, shipmates.
Or catnapped, in your case.
And that means we have to work.
Jaune Tom.
It's all right, Jaune Tom.
We'll get back all right.
Oh, it's such a big ocean, Robespierre, bigger than all France.
Bigger than the whole world.
Sure it is, but you've never given up hope yet.
I have now.
It's too big, Robespierre.
We'll never get back to find Mewsette.
It's not as big as you think, Jaune Tom.
Why, look.
It's just made up of little drops.
It's all how you look at it.
Honestly, Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom?
There you are, shipmates.
I have good news!
We are headed for Alaska and the gold rush.
We will strike it rich, my friends.
Then we will return to Paris in style.
No time for games, little turtle.
The rain has stopped and I have work to do.
I must swab the deck, yes?
"Dear Mr. Phtt:
According to your instructions,
I am having Mewsette's portrait painted...
...by the most famous artists in Paris.
Many of them are not yet well-known in America...
...so please allow me to tell you a little bit about each one.
Claude Monet might well be said to be the father of the Impressionist movement.
You will notice how Monsieur Monet achieves a shimmering light...
...throughout the picture...
...and an impression of air and space.
A man of noble birth is
Monsieur Henri Toulouse-Lautrec...
...who is perhaps best known for his striking posters for the Moulin Rouge.
Pointillism is a highly individual style developed by Georges Seurat...
...in which he creates his astonishing effects...
...by the clever placing of tiny dots of paint...
...next to each other.
Henri Rousseau is an ex-soldier with no formal art training.
He is known as a 'primitive painter.'
With his vivid imagination...
...he is creating a charming world of his own...
...where oranges grow on banana trees.
Amedeo Modigliani is a talented young Italian painter...
...who shows great promise.
Sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pose for him.
A Dutch painter who has found new inspiration here in Paris...
...is a man of violent temperament:
Vincent van Gogh.
To achieve a strong emotional impact...
...he sometimes applies paint directly from the tube.
Monsieur Edgar Degas frequently uses ballet dancers as his models.
To arrive at his delicate color harmonies...
...he often uses pastels instead of oil paints.
Don't be concerned when you see
Auguste Renoir's portrait.
Mewsette has not gotten fat.
Monsieur Paul Ceanne is an intellectual artist.
He is a masterful organier of color, composition and form.
His subjects often take on the aspects of a still life.
The dynamic Paul Gauguin has only recently returned from Tahiti...
...and his paintings show the influence of the South Sea Islands.
Another young painter here in Paris is a volatile Spaniard...
...who shows every indication of someday setting the art world afire.
His name is Pablo Picasso.
And so, hoping that you will enjoy them,
I ship these paintings on to you.
And tonight I am sending the original article:
Mewsette herself."
Here. Mail this letter, Armond.
Now, I want no slip-ups.
The train leaves at midnight.
I'll be back shortly with the belle of Paris.
I want you to see that she is comfortably settled in her...
...compartment.
I hope my little protegee is ready for her great adventure, sister.
She is, but you don't get her till I'm paid.
In full.
No money, no Mewsette.
Very well, then.
I'll write you a check.
- It's better than money.
- Now, that's more like it.
It will be well worth it, Meowrice.
Mewsette is my greatest achievement, my crowning glory.
For the sake of your dear neck,
I do hope so.
How gallantly you put your case, Meowrice.
No girl could resist you.
Judge for yourself whether you're getting your money's worth.
- Mewsette, chérie.
- Yes, dear Madame Rubens-Chatte?
- Why, brother. Don't tell me...?
- Momentary lapse, my dear.
Even cats are sometimes human.
Mewsette, my dear young friend, you are beautiful beyond compare.
Thank you, monsieur.
You are most kind.
Tonight I wish to speak to you of something very personal.
I think you will agree that before this night is over...
...all your dreams will come true.
Oh, Madame Rubens-Chatte, isn't it wonderful?
I do thank you for making it all possible.
Come, my dear. Paris awaits you.
And, dear madame, may I say everything that happens...
...is because of your faith in me?
I'll be back soon and tell you about it.
Don't wait up, sister.
It will be later than she thinks.
I'm going to miss that beautiful little thing.
Well, at least I've got this check to cheer me up.
What's happ...?
What's happening?
Why, that double-crosser! That crook!
He used disappearing ink.
Do you know, if the opportunity arose...
...to do him a disservice...
...I might not be able to resist it.
The moon is beautiful tonight, mon chérie.
Oh, yes. So romantic.
Step in here, my dear...
...out of the chill night wind.
What was it you wished to tell me, Meowrice?
Tonight I wish to speak of love and marriage.
You have thought of marriage, haven't you?
Yes, I...
- I suppose I have.
- Good.
Then I know just the one for you.
Here's his picture.
His name is Henry Phtt...
...of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
You mean you want me to marry this...
...fat, old...?
- You are as bright as you are pretty.
So please get into the basket...
...like a good little bride-to-be.
- Who are they?
- Business associates, chérie.
Just get into the basket, and you won't have to look at them anymore.
Into the basket?
No! Oh, no!
Yes! Oh, yes!
You are going to Pittsburgh to marry that rich American.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Isn't that why you left the farm?
Yes. I mean, no.
I just...
I just want Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom? You mean the world's greatest mouser?
Why, old Jaune Tom's probably in Alaska about now.
He is not. You're lying...
...just like you did about everything else.
Call it a weakness.
Now get into the basket.
No! I won't!
I'm not going to marry anybody!
After her, boys!
Don't let her fall!
I have already paid the postage.
Come down from there,
Armond, you idiot.
No time for second-story work tonight.
Well, why didn't you say so, you epithet?
Well, do you see her?
Hurry. Hurry!
You fools. Don't you see those paw prints?
This should be easy.
Let's go.
She's not down here.
Back the other way!
There she goes!
Get rid of that dog, you bumbling idiots!
Your whiskers tickle, cats.
And since I can't stand to be tickled by no cats...
...I'm gonna tear your tails off and have them for breakfast.
We understand your feelings, sir.
Nothing like cats' tails for breakfast...
...but back there, among those barrels, is a...
No! Please!
Let's talk this over.
After all I've done for you.
Taught you everything I know...
...made you despicable scoundrels beyond compare.
And what happens? You meet one little dog and I, Meowrice...
...have to save your miserable, worthless lives.
Now, get out there and find Mewsette.
Brave country, is it not, mes amis?
This weather, she's a little nippy for cats.
You could call it "catnip weather."
Catnip weather, no?
No. Well, I am discouraged too.
We come for gold, we find cold.
I tell you what.
Let's join the Foreign Legion.
We go to Africa and get warm again, eh?
Mon dieu! Little turtle, look!
We've struck it rich!
Jaune Tom, we're rich!
We're rich!
Wow!
We're rich! Now we can go back.
Six weeks. Six whole weeks lost.
Never send kittens to do a cat's job, I always say.
And now that I'm getting these splints off my tail...
How are you, baby?
Good as new?
Now, then!
We are going out and find Mewsette...
...or there will be four new violins in the world.
Lovely view, eh, mademoiselle?
Oh, no! Please!
If there was any other way,
I would have waited, Jaune Tom.
Nice fielding, team.
Come along. We'll take the scenic route home.
The first thing we do is head for that
Madame what's her name's salon...
...and they're bound to know where she is.
Come on, let's go.
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'm right behind you.
There it is.
- Where's Mewsette?
- She's in danger.
- Yes, I know, but...
- They've taken her to Meowrice's...
...and I think she's still there.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Never mind the thanks.
Just give Meowrice my love and then turn him inside out.
Now, hurry. Hurry!
Canned fish?
What won't they think of next?
Everything is packaged these days.
Even pretty girls, hmm?
What?
Jaune Tom? The champion mouser?
At Madame Rubens-Chatte's?
Quick, then. We must be off to the train.
Grab the handles.
Put your backs into it.
Get moving, you idiots.
All right, lads, the coast is clear.
Let's go.
Mewsette.
Mewsette!
Mewsette, where are you?
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'll be right there.
It's no use, Robespierre.
We're too late.
Nobody to...
...with?
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Stop.
Look. There's a message.
"Jaune Tom, I'm being taken to the train."
Tears of gratitude, chérie?
Just think, in a few hours, you will be on a boat to America...
...and your new, old, rich husband.
Well, well, there are your little friends...
...down to bid you goodbye.
What are we gonna do?
I'm too pooped.
Au revoir, my children.
Don't forget to write.
Hey. Hey, maybe if I...
Maybe if I imagine...
Mewsette?
- Mewsette, where are you?
- Jaune Tom!
Good work, gentlemen.
Stop him, someone.
Toss him out the door, boys.
He ought to make quite a splash.
Jaune Tom, help!
They've got Robespierre!
Too late, my dear.
Are you all right, Mewsette?
You look all right.
I mean, at least your eyes do.
If you'll let me out now, Jaune Tom,
I'll show you how I really look.
Sure, sure.
What's the matter with me anyway?
It doesn't really matter, though.
Why, Jaune Tom, that's the nicest thing anybody ever said to me.
Jaune Tom, I've been such a fool.
Jaune Tom, look out!
You keep out of it, Robespierre.
Jaune Tom, hold it!
Stop.
"Mr. Henry Phtt.
1411 Sand Box Road."
Oh, yes.
Good idea, Robespierre.
Now, you go to beddy-bye, and when you wake up...
...you'll be on a boat going to meet that rich husband.
Right, Robespierre?
Please. Please don't say anything more. I'm dying.
I'm dying, I tell you!

MAN:
What? He slipped and fell?
- 1337, wasn't it?
- You think he'll be okay?
MASTER CHIEF: This kind of thing happens to him all the time.
Well, 1337 is still a Spartan.
He's been trained with the best of them.
There's no need for concern.
MAN:
If you say so, Master Chief.
It wouldn't be the first time he fell off a Pelican.
- But still, I am a little worried.
MASTER CHIEF: Yeah.
Oh, no.
Hey! Wait for me! Come back!
Don't leave me behind!
I'm gonna have to rendezvous with them somewhere.
Huh?
I wonder if these natives are dangerous?
Hey, look at that.
It's the junky old robot that fell.
Ha-ha-ha. I am not some junky robot.
Even if you don't wanna know,
I'll tell you who I am.
I am one of the strongest warriors in space.
I am Spartan-1337.
- I wouldn't stand there if I were you.
- It's not safe.
1337: How dare they ignore my awesome heroism.
Fear not. I am the strongest warrior in the... Oh, no.
[1337 GRUNTING]
I'm fine. That was just a few dents.
[1337 GROANING & GRUNTING]
He doesn't really get along with strangers all that much.
[GROANING]
ALIEN 1: So where is the accursed group of Spartans?
ALIEN 2 [ON RADIO]: On Cronkee, the fourth planet of the Unicon system.
ALIEN 1: Excellent.
This is the perfect opportunity...
...to show those Spartans a thing or two about Covenant power.
- Bring out Pluton.
- Yes, sir.
ALIEN 1: Yes. It is the finest bio-warrior ever created.
Now go to the planet Cronkee and demonstrate our might.
ALIEN 2: But Pluton's weapons are still in the experimental stage.
They'll be enough to vanquish the humans.
Don't you think a real battle will be the best way...
...to conduct our little test?
If that is your wish.
I will get you at long last, Master Chief.
Now go, Pluton!
PLUTON: Guh.
- Not "guh." Go destroy them!
[GROWLING]
No, not over here.
- He's over that way. He's over there!
- Huh?
Don't "huh" me. Go that way.
[PLUTON GROWLING]
I need a vacation.
[GARBLED RADIO INTERFERENCE]
1337: Chief, respond please.
Can you hear me? Chief? Over.
There's some strange interference.
- Hello? Can you hear me?
BOY 1: We can hear you.
1337: Not you. And I thought I told you to stop following me.
BOY 1: Robot, look.
- I told you I'm not a robot.
What's that?
BOY 2: Sure is a lot of junk falling from the sky today.
[ROARING]
Covenant? It's dangerous.
Get out of here!
- As far as you can.
BOY 1: Okay.
[ROARING]
[KIDS SCREAMING]
[1337 GRUNTING]
Chief, this... Stop it. Stop it.
[ROARING]
[SCREAMING]
BROTHER:
Are you guys all right?
- Hey, look. It's big brother.
BOY 2: And big sister.
Any of you know what that thing is?
It looks like he almost blew up the mountain range.
He fell from the sky. All of a sudden, he and this giant monkey started going nuts.
BROTHER: Don't worry.
Your big brother is gonna take care of it.
Yeah. Well, he might be a little tougher than you think.
We don't have much choice.
We'll just have to try our best.
SISTER:
Yeah, you might lose.
BROTHER: Why would you say that?
Give me some credit, will you?
It must have been scary.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm kind of hungry.
[LAUGHS]
BROTHER:
All right, let's do this.
[GARBLED RADIO INTERFERENCE]
I'm not gonna lose. No way can I lose.
I am Spartan-1337.
No one else will say it, so I will.
The fact that I never give up is one of my good points!
Hey, look. The rain stopped.
The robot's back.
What's that?
BROTHER: Apparently they used to travel between the stars with that.
1337: An old UNSC frigate.
Must've crash-landed.
SISTER:
I hear that we were all born inside there.
BROTHER:
Mama raised us all by herself.
Mama?
You kids should stay behind.
This is my fight.
BROTHER: Don't worry about it. We may not look it, but we're pretty tough.
SISTER:
Though, we're no match for Mama.
Mama, huh?
BROTHER: When we were still little she fought off a bunch...
...of bird-headed pirates by herself.
That sounds like one heck of a mama.
But you know what?
I'm one heck of a mama myself.
[BROTHER & SISTER GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
[1337 GRUNTING]
[ALL PANTING]
I did it.
I did it!
BROTHER: Oh, no. We'll be done for if he reaches full strength.
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah, and that's gonna be the hard part.
Less talk, more action.
Ah!
[SISTER SCREAMING]
[BOTH SCREAMING]
BROTHER:
This isn't good. He won't budge.
SISTER:
We're totally screwed.
BROTHER:
What else can we do?
We're doomed.
BROTHER & SISTER:
Well, don't jinx us!
I'm just kidding.
We gotta do something.
Hey, what the heck is that?
BROTHER:
Oh, as if he'd ever fall for that.
SISTER:
He did fall for it.
1337: He did? He did.
Now let's get out of here.
[ROARING]
[BEEPING]
[ROARING]
Whoa. What's happening?
[BLEEPING]
No way.
Ah!
Is that a Slipspace rupture?
[BEEP]
Ah!
That was Mama.
SISTER:
I told you, no one was as tough as Mama.
MAN: Master Chief, radio contact has been reestablished.
MASTER CHIEF:
Good. I'll try to contact 1337.
There's another Al living on this planet.
MASTER CHIEF: What?
- I've lost contact with it.
But I'm pretty sure I felt it just tinkering with the Slipspace drive.
She's another Al it seems. Just like I am.
MASTER CHIEF:
Why here?
- You want me to collect her?
- No. Let's not do that.
It's a very old Al construct.
You might say something of an antique.
- She seems...
- Seems what?
Happy. If I'm understanding correctly, she seems to be happy here. Hm.
MASTER CHIEF:
Hm.
BROTHER & SISTER:
We're home.
MAMA: Were you playing as cavemen again? You really do like that game.
BOY 1: Mama, you're not gonna believe what happened today.
MAMA: All right, all right.
You can tell me all about that later.
BROTHER:
Mama, just what did you do back there?
MAMA:
That's not important right now.
By the way, dinner is ready.
GIRL: I'm hungry.
MAMA: I thought so.
- Now go wash your hands.
KIDS: Okay.
MAMA:
And clean behind your ears.
Mama.
CHIEF [ON RADIO]:
Can you hear me, 1337? Come in, 1337.
This is 1337. I hear you clearly, sir.
Head to the rendezvous point immediately.
Rendezvous ASAP, over.
Huh? Roger that, sir, but I may run a little late!
[PLUTON GRUNTING]

[ENGLISH SDH]
PLUTON:
Guh.
Porridge today, Gromit!
Tuesday!
Geronimo!
Huh?
Huh? Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, no! No! Turn it off!
Uh, mice, do you think?
I think I'll make my own porridge.
Well, I'll be...
Have you been peckish during the night?
Only someone's been at me cheese.
Well, I don't know.
There's something very fishy going on.
Huh?
Do you think we should get the pest control people in?
Hello, Wallace and Gromit's
Wash 'N' Go
Window Cleaning Service.
May we be of assistance?
Hello.
Yes, my windows could do with a jolly good clean.
The wool shop in the high street.
As soon as you can.
On our way, madam.
Oh!
Need wool, don't you, lad?
Thank you for coming so quickly.
Oh, dear!
Oh, allow me.
Please.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'll soon have these cleared up.
It's no trouble.
How embarrassing.
This is Preston, my dog.
All right, pooch?
Won't take a minute.
- Oh--
- Oh.
Well, I...
What was it you wanted?
I...
Ramsbottom,
Wendolene Ramsbottom.
Oh, charming.
I'm Wallace.
The windows.
Is this place yours?
Mm.
My father left it to me...
Along with his debts and a few other things.
He was an inventor.
Never!
Well, I-
I do a bit of that myself.
Oh!
I see that they still haven't caught those sheep rustlers yet.
Still, you've got plenty of wool, eh?
Your dog's waiting.
Aye, I'd better see to him.
The bounce has gone from his bungee.
Oh, they're spanking.
You've done a grand job.
Windows are our specialty.
Let's get that kettle on.
Good grief!
What's all this?
Burglars, thieves?
Oh, what a mess.
I've never seen anything like it.
Heavens above, Gromit.
Look at this.
The little chap must be really hungry.
Oh, come over here, lad.
No need to be sheepish.
We'll have to get you cleaned up.
There.
Nothing to fret over.
Just a quick shampoo.
We've tested this on Gromit.
Haven't we, lad?
Right.
Off we go, then.
Oh, heck!
Baaaa!
Oh!
Baaaaa-aaa-aaa!
Oh, do something, Gromit!
Oh, it's too late now.
Turn it off, Gromit!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, dear.
Oh, brilliant, Gromit.
Oh, smashing, this.
A bit tight here and there.
Baaaa.
Ah, looks okay to me.
We'll call him Shaun, eh?
Hmm?
Come on, Shaun.
Gromit?
You know we're doing the clock tomorrow.
Sorry, Gromit.
That was a bit thick.
Back in a tick, Gromit.
Won't be long.
Just thought I'd pop in...
Tell me about windows.
Well, it's only temporary, you understand.
Oh, really?
Oh, yes.
I'm inventing, mostly.
Only...
Oh, what sort of inventions?
Well, sort of...
Daddy would loved to have met you.
Poor Daddy.
Of all the women I've met... not that there have been many, you understand.
So you see, what I'm trying to say, in a manner of speaking, is...
Of all the ladies
I've met, you...
Oh! Ohhhh! Oh!
The same time next week?
Baa!
Caught bang to rights, you were.
You've really let us down this time, lad.
Hey, give over.
Shoo, shoo!
Go on with you!
I'm sorry about this.
For what?
Nothing.
Just stay away from me, from my shop and my silly, silly windows.
Well, I...
Forget me.
I'm no good for you.
I'm so sorry about Gromit.
Owwww!
Ba!
Oh, Gromit.
Oh, Gromit!
Oh, Gromit.
Brilliant teamwork, lads!
Yeow!
Ahhhh!
I suppose you'll have to skip the country now.
A fugitive, eh?
You'll be hunted down like...
Well, a dog.
Wendo-
Stop it.
Stop it, Preston.
I want no more of this rustling!
Oh! It wasn't so bad when it was just the wool, but this is evil!
Daddy didn't create you for this!
Ouch!
You're supposed to protect me!
Let me out!
You're not going to turn me into dog meat.
Dog meat?
Help!
Don't worry, Wendolene.
I'm on my way!
We've lost them!
Ah!
Oh!
We're at maximum speed!
She won't go any faster.
Oh, heck!
Wallace, help me!
Don't worry, Wendolene!
Everything's under control.
Ow-oh!
Be careful, Shaun!
Hey, steady on!
Single file.
Oh!
Single file, I said.
Oh! Get yourselves organized down there!
Huh?
Watch out, lads!
Oh, no!
Ah! splat!
Where'd you get that from?
That's my machine!
I've got patent pending on that.
Help.
Oh, Shaun!
Help!
Shaun, where's Gromit?
Shaun, do something!
Help!
Attaboy, Gromit!
Well done, Gromit.
That'll teach him.
He's malfunctioning.
Mal what?
Malfunctioning.
Preston is a cyberdog.
A cyber what?
A robot.
Daddy created him for good, but he's turned out evil.
Huh?
Ah, it's a sheep-mincing thing.
Now, that's clever.
Huh?
Oh!
Do something, Wallace.
Baaa!
Duck!
Where?
By heck!
I though we were all for the can then.
I couldn't pass by without saying thank you.
He's just like he used to be.
Oh, don't mention it.
Thanks, pooch.
Give me a shout if he goes wrong again.
You're very kind.
Won't you come in?
We were just about to have some cheese.
Oh, no, not cheese.
Sorry, it brings me out in a rash.
Can't stand the stuff.
Not even Wensleydale?
Got to be on our way.
Come on, Preston.
Good-bye...
Chuck.
What's wrong with Wensleydale?
Talking of which...
All the more for us, and not a sheep to worry us.
Get off me cheese!
Get off! Get off!
Gromit? Gromit!
Go for him! Gromit!
Oh!
Get off with you!
Oh, dear.
Shoo off.
CHILDREN: Bless all the people, young and old.
For they are yours to love and hold.
And bless
Mr. and Mrs. Cherrywood.
Amen.
Good night, children.
Sweet dreams.
Mrs. Cherrywood, isn't Mr. Cherrywood going to tuck us in?
Oh, he'll be along.
Don't you worry.
I hope I'm not too late.
They've been asking for you.
Mr. Cherrywood!
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
Look sharp, everyone.
Watch the bouncing balls.
All righty, here we go.
A one, a two, a three and there!
Thank you, and thank you.
Now off to sleep to dream of clowns and circuses, acrobats and jugglers.
And remember,
I want a full report in the morning.
Story, Mr. Cherrywood, story?
GIRL: Please, the one about the circus.
Please?
Yeah.
All right, just one story.
Story hat.
Yeah.
This is the story of two young children named Kim and Jason, and how they were helped by a group of very special friends, the Care Bears.
You see, the Care Bears have a very special mission.
And that mission is to help everyone share their feelings with others.
The Care Bears live in a magic place called Care-a-lot.
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Whenever we choose it
* Care-a-lot is a feeling
 we all know
* We never do lose it
* We can find a secret place
* To rest and make a new start
* If you don't know
 where it is
* Look inside your heart
* Care-a-lot is a playground
 you can find
* For sliding and swinging
* Carousels playing music
 in your mind
* For dancing and singing
* Sometimes you feel so glad
* Sometimes you feel blue
* Share your feelings,
 it's not bad
* Feelings are just you
* When you're lonely
* Don't you fret
* You're not alone
 you just tend to forget
* Care-a-lot is easily found
* You've been there
* And you have friends
 who care
* Don't you let your sadness
 get you down
* It always helps
 when you sing a song
* Good cheer carries you along
* Through darkness leads
 to sunlight
* A new day comes,
 it's all right
* Care-a-lot is a place
 you'd like to be
* Riding on a cloud,
 you'll care a lot
* It's a rainbow fantasy
* For laughing out loud
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Care-a-lot,
 it's a place we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Learn to care a lot
* Share a lot
* Care-a-lot
No, Secret Bear,
I don't think it was the Cloud-mobile's fault.
Hi. I'm Friend Bear and this is Secret Bear.
We're Care Bears.
What do you want?
Only to be your friends.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: You see,
 although Kim and Jason were
warm and loving children, they had been so hurt
 when their parents
went away that they had decided
 never to love anyone
ever again, just in case
 they, too, went away.
Kim and Jason felt
they didn't need anyone, but the Care Bears
 knew better.
Everyone needs friends, Jason, even you and Kim.
We're not your friends.
How do you know our names?
We know a lot of things about you.
Kim reads a lot of books and wants to be a nurse when she grows up.
And, Jason, you wanna be a jet pilot.
Yeah. How did you know that?
Friends are supposed to know about each other's hopes and dreams.
Secret Bear says not to worry.
No one can keep a secret like Secret Bear.
Well, I'll tell you what we know about people you care for.
They always let you down.
KIM: So we'd rather not have any friends.
Don't trouble yourselves.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 While the Care Bears tried
even harder to make friends
 with Kim and Jason,
Tenderheart was on his way
 to help a boy
who wanted friends more than anything else
 in the whole world.
Nicholas was
 a magician's helper.
He had never had
 a friend in his life.
Thanks.
Hey!
Close the door!
Whoa!
I--I didn't mean it.
You never mean it, Nicholas.
I bought that trunk thinking maybe there's some junk in it
I can use in my magic act.
Now half of it's broken!
What am I going to do with you?
Every time I give you a simple thing to do, it's boom this and crash that!
I'm sorry, Mr. Fetuccini.
Enough of your sorrys.
Check that new trunk and see if there's anything left
I can use in my magic act.
I have a show to put on.
Perhaps one day
I will teach you how to make an audience love you.
But right now you're next to hopeless.
I wish...
I'd give anything to find a way to get people to like me.
FEMALE VOICE: Anything?
Nicholas?
Who's there?
Who said that?
You did say
"anything"?
Whoa!
Gosh.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 Tenderheart was trapped.
He needed some
 Care Bear reinforcements.
But unfortunately they were
 busy with their new invention.
SHARE BEAR:
With this Rainbow Rescue Beam, we can send a Care Bear anywhere in the whole world in a matter of seconds.
Or bring them back again in case of an emergency.
We'll be able to help people share their feelings a lot quicker.
We've gotta get it working first, Share Bear.
And then we still won't know what'll happen until we give it another test.
How come I'm always the one fixing things around here?
Because you never complain,
Grumpy Bear.
I think I know why the first test didn't work.
There. This little star got itself stuck in the gears.
Now that's what I call
"star stuck," Grumpy Bear.
Has anyone seen Baby Hugs and Baby Tugs?
I can't find them anywhere.
We'll help you look,
Grams Bear.
We can test the Rainbow Rescue Beam later.
That Baby Tugs is probably just getting into mischief somewhere.
What's this thing, Tugs?
It's not a thing, Hugs.
It's, uh, a thing-a-ma-dooey.
You know everything, Tugs.
What's it do?
It makes bubbles.
Square bubbles!
Square bubbles?
Golly, make square bubbles,
Tugs.
Any special color?
No square bubbles, Tugs.
Not even round ones.
HUGS: You broke the thing.
GRUMPY BEAR:
Baby Hugs, Baby Tugs, what have you done?
BIRTHDAY BEAR: It's obvious,
Grumpy Bear, they got the Rainbow Rescue
Beam working.
But we still don't know if it'll transport anyone.
Look!
Oh, my stars, it brought visitors.
What are they doing here?
We didn't bring them.
They just came along.
Someone brought us here.
I knew it!
Baby Bear mischief.
What are we gonna do with those children?
SHARE BEAR: I don't know.
This has never happened before.
Perhaps we can let them stay.
Hey, could we say something?
Where are we?
We're terribly sorry.
Bears?
We're the Care Bears.
BOTH: More friends?
Welcome to Care-a-lot!
Come on.
We'll give you a tour.
Okay, but we're not gonna like it.
(NOBODY CARES LIKE A BEAR
 PLAYING)
* I know you're thinking
 that nobody cares
* You've got some feelings
 you don't wanna share
* But if your troubles stay
 all stuck inside
* They're gonna grow
 till they're too big to hide
* I know you're trying
 to steer so clear of friends
* You've had a few
 that left you in the end
* I gotta tell you
 it ain't always so
* Somebody loves you
 who ain't gonna go
* So follow me
 and let me take you where
* If you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* You'll need a friend to get a big job done
* I guess sometimes two heads are better than one
* You'll need a friend to let your feelings free
* Sure could use someone to talk to me
* So make a friend
 and let me take you where
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* So don't go sticking
 by your own sweet self
* You gotta take a chance
 on someone else
* That's what it's all about,
 just being friends
* And take a chance
 on loving again
* And follow me
 and let me take you where
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
MR. CHERRYWOOD: (CHUCKLING)
 Well, thanks to
 the Care Bears,
Kim and Jason remembered
 how good it was
 to have friends who cared.
Their troubles were over.
But for Nicholas,
 his real troubles were
 just beginning.
FEMALE VOICE: Nicholas?
Who are you?
How do you know my name?
I am a spirit, Nicholas.
Your friend.
I know many things.
Almost everything.
Everything?
I know how you can earn
 more friends.
Really? How?
With magic.
Magic?
Oh, not his magic tricks.
I mean real magic.
Magic that can make
 your fondest wish come true.
Y-You mean, you could use magic to get people to like me?
No.
But you could.
All you have to do is undo the lock.
No, don't!
Hey, what are you doing in there?
I've gotta stop this!
Nicholas! Nicky?
Hey, are you okay in there?
Read this.
Did I do that?
You can do a lot more.
Hey, Nicky, open up!
The door's stuck!
Read!
FETUCCINI:
Hey, Nicholas!
SPIRIT: Go ahead.
Open it.
Hey, it worked.
Your spell worked.
Well done, Nicholas.
He'll be in a deep sleep only long enough for you to take over his magic show.
But I couldn't.
Yes, you can. You must.
This is your chance to show that you are a greater magician than he.
They love him for his magic.
They'll love you for yours.
I'll help you.
TENDERHEART:
Nicholas, stop!
This isn't the way to make friends.
Who are you?
I'm Tenderheart, a Care Bear.
Your friend.
Friend?
Where was he when you needed him?
What matters is,
I'm here now, when Nicholas needs me the most.
SPIRIT: See, Nicholas?
Magic can do anything you want it to.
Hey, neat!
TENDERHEART: Magic isn't the answer, Nicholas.
Your feelings can help you find the true answer.
Don't listen to him!
There are dozens of children out there waiting to see your magic.
They'll love me just like they love
The Great Fetuccini.
I know all his tricks.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
He won't succeed.
The spirit doesn't care about him.
But I do!
NICHOLAS:
And now The Amazing Nicholas will pull a dove out of his hat.
Stop it!
I knew this was going to happen.
Make them stop laughing.
Make them stop!
Only you can do that. Here!
Teach them a lesson.
A--A lesson?
BOY: Come on!
Make us laugh.
SPIRIT: One they'll never forget.
Nicholas! No!
Now they know how you felt all your life without a friend in the world.
Now they feel nothing!
Nicholas, what have you done?
Only what they did to me.
They deserved it.
No, Nicholas, please listen!
Quick, Nicholas!
SPIRIT: This is only
 the beginning!
This is a job for all the Care Bears.
WISH BEAR: Jason! Kim!
Wait'll you hear this.
Look, Secret Bear,
Wish Bear's got her head stuck in the clouds again.
Now where's my Star-oscope?
Looking for this?
Oh, sorry, Grumpy Bear, but I'm in a hurry.
I've got great news for Kim and Jason.
I spotted...
Look!
FRIEND BEAR:
Tenderheart's Rainbow Roller is out of control!
Oh, no!
Quick, run for cover!
It's coming!
Brace yourselves!
What's coming?
Everyone okay?
Share Bear?
I think so.
Too bad we can't say the same for Care-a-lot.
Look!
FRIEND BEAR: Oh, no!
Everything's broken!
Faded!
Ruined!
FUNSHINE BEAR: Tenderheart!
The Caring Meter dropped two whole points!
A lot of people must have suddenly just stopped caring.
What could have caused that?
The same thing that caused the cloud quake!
A boy named Nicholas is being taken over by an evil spirit.
An evil spirit?
What happens when the
Caring Meter drops to zero?
No one in the world will care anymore.
And the end of Care-a-lot?
I think that's exactly what the spirit has in mind!
Oh, my gosh, I forgot.
I sighted parents for you at the orphanage.
They want to adopt you both.
Congratulations,
Kim and Jason.
Come on, Grumpy, let's warm up the
Rainbow Rescue Beam.
Kim and Jason have to get back in a hurry.
Hear that, Jason? Parents!
Yeah.
I thought we'd never have parents.
Yeah.
But, Kim...
I know, Jason.
Our friends, they're in trouble.
Kim, Jason, we're ready.
All set?
No!
We're not going back to the orphanage.
We're going to help you.
Yeah.
But you have parents waiting.
We made up our minds.
You showed us how to share our feelings, and that's just what we're going to do.
Yeah? Really?
BOTH: Yeah.
All right, our first job is to go to Earth and find Nicholas.
Friend Bear, Secret Bear, you head down with Kim and Jason.
We'll follow.
Hold on to this for me, Jason.
Don't lose it.
It's very important.
Don't worry, Tenderheart,
I wouldn't lose it for nothing.
All right, Champ Bear and Funshine, you're next!
GRUMPY BEAR: Oh, no!
The Rainbow Rescue Beam's jammed!
They never made it to Earth.
What do you mean?
Where are they?
They're lost somewhere between here and Earth.
What do we do now?
We can't follow them.
And the evil spirit said this was just the beginning.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 As Nicholas continued to cast
the spirit's evil spells, more and more people
 stopped caring.
Everyone in this town has friends.
But soon they'll all be just like me.
Friendless!
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
As this wave of uncaring grew, so did the storms
 around Care-a-lot.
The Care Bears were trapped,
cut off from the Earth, and any chance of rescuing
 Kim, Jason, Secret Bear,
 and Friend Bear.
The cloud quakes had broken
 the Rainbow Rescue Beam.
But the Care Bears would
 never give up.
That's what made them think
 of the river.
Good luck, Care Bears.
We're counting on you!
MR. CHERRYWOOD: No one
 in Care-a-lot had ever
 followed the river.
They had no idea whether
 it would lead them to Kim,
Jason, and the missing Care Bears,
 or to nowhere at all.
But the Rainbow Rescue Beam
had dropped Kim, Jason, and the two Care Bears right smack in the middle
 of a strange new land.
Wow.
This doesn't look like the Earth I remember.
Maybe we're still in Care-a-lot.
FRIEND BEAR:
If this is Care-a-lot, then someone's been doing a little gardening since we left.
Whoa!
I can't hold on much longer.
Secret Bear says not to worry about falling.
Worry about the lion instead.
ALL: Lion?
What are we going to do?
FRIEND BEAR: Close your eyes.
Maybe he won't see us.
See? He's gone.
JASON: Kim!
Give me your hand, slowly.
JASON: Oh, no!
Hey, they don't have any tails.
Wow.
The monkey can talk.
What happened to all your fur?
We--We never had any fur.
That's impossible!
Every monkey has fur.
And who said they were monkeys? Hmm?
Well, they were up in the tree.
I know.
They're lions with haircuts.
We're not lions or monkeys.
Yeah. We're people.
And we're Care Bears.
Where did you come from?
BRAVE HEART LION:
Why, we live here.
Everyone in the Forest of Feelings knows of Playful Heart Monkey and Brave Heart Lion.
Forest of Feelings?
Well, we're from Earth.
And Care-a-lot.
Earth? Care-a-lot?
There's no such place.
There is, too!
Don't mind Playful Heart.
He loves to laugh at anything.
I've heard tales long ago about other places.
What are these other places like?
(HOME IS IN YOUR HEART
 PLAYING)
* Do you have a place where rainbows grow
* To carry a bear who's sliding?
* Well, I have a rock in a cave below
* Just perfect for hiding
* Do you have a house made all out of wood
* For keeping you dry when it's raining?
FRIEND BEAR: * I stay on top when the rain goes drop
* Look, I'm hydroplaning
Wee!
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Do you have a star that can travel far
* And tell you what my star told me?
* No, but I have a tree that plays with me
* With branches that swing and enfold me
* Do you have a flower?
We call it a rose
* Its petals are softer than pillows
Look, I see a bee on Friend Bear's nose!
KIM: Stop!
Stay perfectly still.
Oh!
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* Loving each other
* What we've got are places with a different name
* But they're all the same
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* Right here with you, my friend
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are all the same
* We are all the same
* Do you have a bed where you sleep at night
* With billowy blankets all over?
PLAYFUL HEART MONKEY:
 I sleep in a thicket,
on soft green grass, covered with cushiony clover.
My bed is cozy and light as a cloud.
Your bed is a cloud!
Oh, yeah.
* Colors and flowers and hearts in a crown
* Are just about everywhere
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* We love each other, loving each other
* What we've got are places with a different name
* Home is all the same
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
You're welcome to stay in the Forest of Feelings as long as you like.
Thank you, Brave Heart, but the sooner we leave the better.
If we don't hurry,
Care-a-lot may not be there when we get back.
We have to find a way back to Earth.
To help stop the evil spirit from taking all the feelings from everybody.
Come on, everybody.
Where?
If there is a way out of the Forest of Feelings, we'll help you find it.
This way.
There!
The spell is cast.
Now everyone in town will know the loneliness they've made me feel.
Not quite.
Look!
These two small children still care very much about everyone, except you.
But they were to fall under my spell.
Ah, but those--those soft little bears shield them from your spells with their love and caring.
Let them go!
I'm even now!
Are you?
What about all the others?
Others?
All the others that you have not yet cast your spells on.
All the others that still care.
I've gotten even with the whole town.
That's all I wanted.
The others will come after you for what you've done.
What should I do?
You must finish it.
Go ahead, say it!
SPIRIT: This spell will seek out the children and bring them to us at any cost.
But isn't there another way?
No! They must be taught a lesson!
A lesson for the children.
A lesson for the town!
A lesson for everyone.
What do you mean, "everyone"?
Now go!
You said, "a lesson."
What kind of lesson?
Never mind that.
You must now collect the ingredients for your next spell.
WISH BEAR: There's nothing ahead to tell us where we are,
Tenderheart.
Bear overboard!
Bedtime Bear went to sleep and fell overboard.
Look!
Hi. I think you've lost something.
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR:
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm sure Bedtime Bear will thank you, too, when he wakes up.
COZY HEART PENGUIN:
No thanks needed.
I'm Cozy Heart Penguin.
Helping someone in need is what warms my heart and keeps me cozy.
Well, it must work,
Cozy Heart.
This water's freezing!
I love it!
First we have to find
Kim and Jason, and then...
Uh-oh.
Something's pulling at the wheel.
Tenderheart, why are you turning here?
I'm not!
The boat's turning by itself!
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR: We're caught in some kind of whirlpool!
ALL: Whoa!
ALL: Whoa!
WISH BEAR:
Somebody do something!
A rope!
Throw me a rope!
Do as she says!
Quick!
Guide this rope,
Little Star.
Oh, Champ Bear, we're saved!
May I introduce the strongest, most fearsome creature in the entire
Forest of Feelings.
Lotsa Heart Elephant.
Hello.
Hey, you're a lot smaller than you sound.
It's true that I'm not big, but it's amazing what you can do if you really put your heart into it.
(LAUGHING) Sometimes I even startle myself.
It's not going to work.
Even the Spell can't defeat them.
The Spell was just having a little sport.
The children are his true goal.
Perhaps a sprinkle of toadstool mold would speed things up.
Grumpy Bear!
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow.
The Caring Meter is down to five.
If it reaches zero,
Care-a-lot is finished!
And no one will care anymore.
Any luck fixing the Rainbow Rescue Beam?
I think I used up all my good luck getting this far.
Maybe your luck's run out, but not mine!
I need a piece that looks like this.
Whoa!
Try that.
It's Baby Hugs' lollipop.
Perfect!
You know, Baby Hugs and Tugs are gonna make fine Care Bears one of these days.
You rest there while I scout up ahead.
ALL: Whew.
While Brave Heart's gone, let's play a guessing game.
What am I?
I don't know.
Look out!
Help!
Let us go!
Help!
Oh, no!
Let us go!
Charge!
Help!
All right, you asked for it!
Whoa.
Let them go!
Swift Heart!
Oh.
Phew.
Whoa!
Let's get out of here!
Come on, Swift Heart.
SWIFT HEART RABBIT:
I'm way ahead of you.
Oh, no!
That's the most unfriendly tree I've ever seen.
Well, thanks to you,
Swift Heart, we're safe for now.
FRIEND BEAR: There's a serious task at hand, Swift Heart.
It seems that the evil spirit is after Kim and Jason.
An evil spirit in the Forest of Feelings?
We'll fill you in as we go.
Let's get moving.
TENDERHEART: Lotsa Heart, do you think this river might lead us down to Earth?
It has to go somewhere.
Hang on, everyone, we're going for a ride.
ALL: Whoa!
Look, a cave!
TENDERHEART:
I can't see a thing.
VOICE: Steer to the left!
TENDERHEART:
Who said that?
FUNSHINE BEAR: Not me.
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR:
Neither did I.
WISH BEAR: It wasn't me.
VOICE: It was me!
I said it!
TENDERHEART:
Who are you?
VOICE: Don't ask questions.
Steer left quick!
TENDERHEART: Hang on, everyone!
Phew, that was close.
You almost smashed right into a big rock.
Look!
I see light up ahead.
A raccoon?
No wonder you could see in the dark.
Not just a raccoon.
Bright Heart Raccoon.
I can usually see my way through anything.
WISH BEAR: Waterfalls ahead!
We better do something quick.
Care Bears!
Ready?
Now!
Whoa!
Well done, Care Bears.
LOTSA HEART: Let's hear it for the Care Bears!
ALL: Hip, hip, hurray!
Hip, hip, hurray!
Oh, no!
Run!
Brave Heart?
Whoa!
Oh, no!
Are you okay, Kim?
Jason, we've got to run.
Where? We're trapped.
And that bird knows it, too.
We can't reach them!
You're right, Secret Bear.
Our only hope is a Care Bear Stare.
I just hope it works.
There's only two of us.
Right again.
We've got to try.
Care Bears stare!
The two of us aren't enough!
Oh, no!
Look!
Care Bears stare!
That was magnificent.
Your friends arrived just in time.
Jason, Kim!
You're all right!
Thanks to our new friends.
I know exactly what you mean.
I think things will get a lot easier now that we're together, Brave Heart.
I couldn't agree with you more, Lotsa Heart.
Soon you'll be out of the Forest of Feelings.
Then your journey will really begin.
You're not coming with us?
Well, uh, yes, if you think we could help.
Glad to have you along.
We can use all the help we can get.
Well, in that case...
* We're calling for
 the loyal hearts
* Wherever they may be
* We're calling for
 the proud hearts
* To come and follow me
* We're calling for
 the gentle hearts
* To keep us company
* And it would be
 a treat heart
* If you would follow me
* 'Cause there's
 a job to be done
* We're gonna need everyone
* Because nobody
 can do it alone
* We'll need the swift
 and the small
* We'll need the strong
 and the tall
* 'Cause everyone has
 a strength of their own
* And when you put it
 all together
* Then there's a power
 no one can deny
* It's the power to share,
 it's the power to care
* 'Cause when you care
 you're not afraid to try
* Yeah!
* And when you put it
 all together
* Then there's a power
 no one can deny
* It's the power to share,
 it's the power to care
* When you care,
 you're not afraid to try *
SPIRIT: They're on their way.
Here?
You'll be ready for them.
How?
By completing your final spell.
Final spell?
Yes.
You must gather the elements quickly.
When those two children arrive, they must be all that is left of caring in this world.
You don't mean...
Yes!
Everyone must be taught the lesson.
But...
Don't you see, Nicholas?
It's too late to stop now.
You must finish what you started!
There's no turning back!
MR. CHERRYWOOD: It was
 hard to believe that only
a short time ago this was a place
 of happiness and joy.
Now, without love
to keep it alive, it had become a home of fear, loneliness and ruin.
Time was running out
 for the Care Bears.
Nicholas and the evil spirit
had to be stopped before they cast
 their final spell.
A world without caring?
This doesn't look like the Earth you talked about.
We've got to stop it before it gets worse.
I don't think this place could get any worse.
Nicholas and the spirit must be around here somewhere.
We've got to find them as quickly as possible.
I suggest we split up.
I agree, Tenderheart.
The first ones to spot them, warn the others.
Okay, let's go get them.
Jason, do you still have the key that I gave you?
Sure do.
Good. Now, promise me you and Kim will stay as far away from Nicholas and the spirit as you can.
But I wanna help.
You can help best by guarding that key.
B-But...
If we lose that key, Jason, we can never win.
I understand, Tenderheart.
You can count on me.
Three apple cores.
Just what I need.
One spider's web.
My list is almost complete.
A few more items, a few magic words, and presto, a world without love.
Love-a-lot, did you hear that?
We have to get word to the others before it's too late.
Hmm. Let's see. Apple cores, spider's web, milkweed pod...
Huh?
A cigar butt.
I almost missed it.
Now, one last thing to find.
BOTH: Phew.
BOY: There they go.
Phew. That was close.
Oh, no! Run away!
Hurry up! Look out!
Run away!
Get away! Oh, dear!
Watch out!
* Run for cover
* Don't stop to look around
* Nothing to do
* But hide someplace
 where we cannot be found
Don't make a sound.
Look out!
Be careful.
Here he comes!
Whoa!
Run away!
* Look out, he's after you
* You ought to take care,
 but take care where you go
* It's a nightmare coming true
* The evil that's spreading
 is starting to grow
* Your friends are doing
 all they can do
* But what about you?
* How can we help
 this unfortunate soul?
* How can we stop him?
 He's out of control
* Running and hiding
 to stay out of sight
* Running and hiding,
 it doesn't seem right
* Look out! Watch out!
 Hurry, get away!
* Running and hiding
 and running again
* Running and running,
 oh, please make it end
* Isn't there some way
 to make him our friend?
* The spirit's got
 a hold on Nicholas
* He's forgot about feelings
 and friends
* Look out, he's after you
* It's a nightmare coming true
* When will
 this bad dream end?
* He's not himself,
 he's turning mean
* He's been on a path
 of terrible wrath
* No kid's ever seen
SWIFT HEART RABBIT: Hey!
* Friends are there
 to help you out
* Because they care
 and there's no doubt
* That if you're scared,
 they'll lend a hand
* Till you're prepared
 to make a stand
* This power's wrong,
 but incredibly strong
* If only we could
 make him understand
* Look out, watch out!
 Look out! Look out!
* Look out! Watch out!
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you?
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you?
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you? *
Huh?
Icky, sticky bubble gum!
The last ingredient
I need for my final spell.
Let them try and stop me now!
Swift Heart, are you all right?
You bet, Friend Bear.
It takes more than that to slow me down.
Where are Kim and Jason?
Maybe they're hiding and are afraid to show themselves.
TENDERHEART:
Okay, Brave Heart.
You round up your friends and try to find Kim and Jason.
Care Bears, follow me.
What are you going to do,
Tenderheart?
We have to try and get through to Nicholas.
And make him believe that we really do care about him.
And that he really cares about everyone else.
With a Care Bear Stare?
That's right, Cozy Heart.
I wish there was some way we could express our feelings like that.
There's always a way to let others share your feelings,
Gentle Heart, always.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: It was going
to take every ounce of caring that the Care Bears
could muster to reach Nicholas.
But as you remember,
 they were two bears short.
Grumpy Bear and Good Luck Bear were still in Care-a-lot
 trying to fix the Rainbow
Rescue Beam, or what was left of it.
I just need a little more time.
That's the one thing we don't have.
The Caring Meter has fallen to three.
In no time, it'll fall to zero.
And that's the end of Care-a-lot.
We've got to get down there and help!
Good.
Now, the final ingredient.
SPIRIT: Quickly!
Why are you stopping?
I--I--I don't want...
You don't want to?
You must!
You can't care about anything!
No!
SPIRIT: You've gone too far!
Too far to stop!
You can't stop!
You are beyond this!
TENDERHEART: Stop!
Nicholas!
You're too late.
Too late!
The last spell is cast!
We care about everyone, even when they don't care about us.
And right now, the one we care about most is you, Nicholas!
You!
Care Bears, get ready.
Care Bears, stare!
You don't care!
Whoa!
SPIRIT: Now for the very last two children.
COZY HEART PENGUIN:
What happened in there?
SHARE BEAR: The Care Bear
Stare didn't work!
The spirit's power is too strong!
Brave Heart, where are Kim and Jason?
We can't find them anywhere.
Uh-oh. Look!
Nicholas?
Where are they?
As long as Kim and Jason still care, his spell's not complete.
You mean, you can still save him?
We can still save him.
But how?
Just feel it!
Care Bears?
Ha!
Well, what do you know?
The Rainbow Rescue Beam worked.
See? We just needed a little luck.
GRUMPY BEAR:
Looks like we're gonna need more than that.
Where are they?
Where are you hiding the boy and girl?
You don't know what you're doing, Nicholas.
Listen to your heart, and you'll find the truth.
Where are they?
Care Bears stare!
Too late.
Tenderheart's right.
We can do it, but we have to do it together.
Do what?
Okay, everybody.
Uh, uh, everybody, uh...
That's it!
Everybody call!
SPIRIT: No!
Nicholas!
Kim, Jason, no!
It's them!
It's the children.
Nicholas!
We care about you.
We used to be like you.
We thought nobody cared.
But we were wrong.
Now we want to be your friends, Nicholas, and make sure you're never alone again.
Believe us, Nicholas, believe us.
I--I--I believe you.
No, you can't!
SPIRIT: Don't do it.
Stop.
You don't care!
They don't care!
Stop!
Please, don't close me!
Jason, the key.
The key!
I--I--I can't hold it much longer!
No!
Oh, no!
Hold on, Nicholas.
Thank you.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: And so it was
 that the love and caring
of the Care Bears, their new friends,
 and the two children
 saved the day.
KIM: I guess Care-a-lot is safe and sound again.
And as long as
Care-a-lot is safe, so is the world below it.
Mr. Fetuccini!
I almost forgot.
He's still under that sleeping spell.
It's showtime!
Mr. Fetuccini!
I'm sorry.
Nicholas, I just had the most wonderful dream.
I dreamed I changed my poster, so that's what I'm going to do.
Now it'll read:
"Fetuccini and Nicholas."
So what do you say, huh?
A partnership.
A part-- A part...
Oh, all right.
"Nicholas and Fetuccini."
Oh, thank you so much.
You won't be disappointed,
I promise.
I can't believe this.
I owe it all to Care Bears and...
To who?
Yeah, uh, they're, um, friends, Mr. Fetuccini.
Just friends.
Friends! That's what it's all about, Nicholas, my boy.
That's what it's all about.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 No matter what happened,
Nicholas now knew that someone
 would be watching over him
 at all times.
And most important of all,
Nicholas had learned that
the best way to make friends is to be a friend yourself.
TENDERHEART:
Our friends from the Forest of Feelings have proven to everyone that there's always a way to show that you care.
And so the purpose of this festive occasion is to let all bear witness to the inauguration of our friends into the Care Bear family.
(IT'S GREAT TO BE
 IN THE CARE BEAR FAMILY
PLAYING)
* Now all you
 Care Bear Cousins come
* And gather next to me
* We're standing here together
* Just as proud as we can be
* We saved the world
 for carin' folks like you
 and you and me
* And when you care together,
 you become a family
* And it's great to be
* In that Care Bear family
* In that Care Bear family
* And I'm proud to see

 too proud, to see

* In that Care Bear family
NICHOLAS: And now,
The Amazing Nicholas will pull a dove out of his hat.
That's my boy.
Bravo, Nicky!
Hey, Jason, aren't parents great?
Yeah.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
And so Kim and Jason found the parents they wanted so very much and lived happily ever after.
And a fine story that was,
Mr. Cherrywood.
My favorite,
Mrs. Cherrywood.
But they never stay awake long enough for the end.
Now they'll never know what eventually became of Nicholas.
I guess all they need to know is that he, too, lived happily ever after.
Happier than I ever thought
I could be.
Nicholas, these children should have been in bed ages ago.
MRS. CHERRYWOOD: What am I ever going to do with you?
Care for me,
Mrs. Cherrywood.
Just care for me.

Look at the skies

To keep from falling like a star
When you make that dizzy climb
For this is the night

Silent as a snowflake in the night
Holy is the spirit of this night
All the world is calm and peaceful
All the world is bright and joyful
Spirit of love
And child of peace
Love unending
That shall not cease
Peace, my children
Of good will
Peace, my children
Peace be still
[man] It's for you, darling.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, Jim, dear.
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?
- Trimmed with ribbons?
- [whimpering]
[Jim] Well, it has a ribbon.
[gasping]
Oh, how sweet.
- [Jim] You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.
Come on, Lady. Over here.
That's a girl.
There, now. A nice little bed for you.
[Darling] But Jim, dear, are you sure she'll be warm enough?
[Jim] Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a...
Uh-oh!
Almost forgot something.
There.
[Jim] Good night, Lady.
Now, now, don't worry, darling.
She'll go right to sleep.
No, no, Lady.
This is where you belong, right here.
- [whimpering]
- [Darling] Oh, look.
She's lonesome.
Don't you think maybe?
Just for tonight?
[Jim] Darling, if we're going to show her who's master, we must be firm from the very beginning.
[whimpering]
[Jim pounding on ceiling] Lady!
Stop that now!
Stop it!
[whimpering]
[footsteps]
[whimpering]
[Jim pounding on door] Lady!
[Jim] Quiet, now. You hear me?
Back to bed!
Quick, now.
Not one more sound.
[chiming]
[scraping]
[snoring]
- [whimpering]
- [Darling] Jim, dear.
[groaning]
[whimpering]
Aw, Jim.
[Jim] Hmm? What?
[whimpering, howling]
[Jim yawning]
[Jim] Oh, all right.
But remember, just for tonight.
[rooster crowing]
[chiming]
[Darling groaning]
[yawns] All right, Lady. All right.
I'm up. I'm up, Lady.
Oh, no!
[Darling] What's wrong, Jim? What is it?
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?
[barking]
[growling, barking]
[bicycle bell rings]
[Jim] Have you noticed, darling, since we've had Lady we see less and less of those disturbing headlines?
[Darling] Yes, I just don't know how we ever got along without her.
[Jim] Say, she must be about six months old.
We'd better be getting her a license.
Hope it fits.
My, but it does look nice.
So grown up.
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?
[humming]
Four steps straight
and then to the left
And right to the place
where I marked it
With a bonnie, bonnie bone
that I buried for me own
In my bonnie, bonnie bank
in the backyard
A-ha, that's a grand sight.
[Lady] Jock!
Oh, Jock!
Hello, Jock.
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie. [chuckles]
Notice anything different?
Eh, uh... You've had a bath?
No, not that.
You've had your nails clipped?
[Lady] Mm-mmm. Guess again.
Well, I wouldn't a-be knowin'.
Why-o, lassie.
A bonnie new collar.
- Do you like it?
- Aye. [sniffs]
Mmm. It must be very expensive.
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.
Ah, we'd best go at once.
You know how sensitive he is about these things.
[snoring]
[whimpering]
[snorting, howling]
He's dreaming.
[Jock] Aye.
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days when he and his grandfather were trackin' criminals through the swamps.
- [Lady] They were?
- That was before...
Before what?
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.
[Jock] It shouldn't have happened to a dog.
But, well...
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.
- [Lady gasps] No!
- [Jock] Aye.
But we must never let on that we know, lassie.
It would break his poor heart.
Uh... Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?
- Go?
- [Trusty] Yeah, big fella.
About, uh, six-foot-two.
[sniffs] No, uh, three.
Wore a striped suit. No collar.
Why, Miss Lady.
You have a collar.
Mm-hmm. And a license.
My, my.
- How time does fly.
- Aye.
It seems only yesterday she was cuttin' her teeth on Jim Dear's slippers, and now there she is, a full-grown lady.
Wearin' the greatest honour man can bestow.
The badge of faith and respectability.
That's right, Miss Lady.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
Aye, you have, laddie.
Oh, yeah.
- [whistling]
- Ooh, it's Jim Dear.
Please excuse me.
Hello, there, Lady.
Come on, beat you home.
Oh, you win again.
Steady, now.
Steady.
Well, what have we here?
Oh, big girl now, huh?
All right.
Oh, ladies first.
You know, darling, with Lady here
I'd say life is quite complete.
[Darling] Yes, dear.
I don't imagine anything could ever take her place in our hearts.
[steam hissing]
[train whistle blows]
[train chugging]
[stretching]
[shuddering]
Ah! What a day!
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.
Hmm? [chuckles]
Aw, cute little rascals.
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
Now. That breakfast, let's see.
Bernie's?
Mmm... no.
Francois...
No, no.
Nope. Too much starch. Ah!
Tony's. Oh, that's it.
I haven't been there in a week.
[Tony] A beautiful day
to make pizza
Hey, still we call it bella notte
[scratching]
Well, buon giorno, Butch.
You want-a your breakfast, eh?
OK. The boss, he's a-saving some a-nice bones for you.
Breakfast comin' up from a-left field.
[chuckles] Good catch!
[man whistling]
[man] Whoa, boy, whoa.
[whistling continues]
[man humming]
Hey. Psst. Psst.
Blimey.
- Look, Peg, it's the Tramp.
- [Tramp] Shh.
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?
All right. No time for wisecracks.
I've got to get you out.
I'm telling you, the pressure's on.
Signs all over town.
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.
- OK, OK, get going.
- [man] Hey! What's going on there?
Scram. And be careful.
- [snarling]
- Why, you mangy mutt.
Hey. Let go. Let go of me.
Well. Snob hill. Ha!
Hi, gals. How's pickings?
Pretty slim, eh?
Yeah. I'll bet they've got a lid on every trash can.
Uh-oh. And a fence around every tree.
[chuckles] I wonder what the leash and collar set does for excitement.
Lassie. Lassie!
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am.
Miss Lady!
[Jock] Ah! Good morning, lassie.
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day. Uh...
...day.
Why, Miss Lady.
Is something wrong?
Aye. Tell us, lassie.
- If somebody's been mistreatin' ya...
- Oh, no, Jock.
It's something I've done, I guess.
You?
It must be.
- Jim Dear and Darling are acting so...
- [Darling humming]
[humming continues]
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, lad.
Now, lassie, get on with the details.
Well, I first noticed it the other day when Jim Dear came home.
[clock chiming]
[barking]
Down, Lady, down!
Darling, darling!
Are you all right?
[Darling] Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?
[Jim] I just can't help worrying.
After all, in your condition, alone here all day, and walking that dog...
- That dog!
- That dog?
He's never called me that before.
Well, now, lassie,
I wouldn't worry my wee head about that.
Remember, they're only humans, after all.
That's right, Miss Lady.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
Aye, you have, laddie.
- Frequently.
- Oh, yeah.
But now Darling is... Well...
We've always enjoyed our afternoon romp together.
But yesterday...
[chiming]
[barking]
[humming]
[whining]
No, Lady. No walk today.
[humming continues]
[barking]
No, Lady.
Not now.
Lady!
Drop that, Lady.
Drop it, I say.
It didn't hurt, really.
But Darling has never struck me... before.
[chuckling] Now, lassie.
Do not take it too seriously.
After all, at a time like this...
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady, there comes a time in the life of all humans when, uh...
Well, as they put it, uh...
Birds and the bees?
Or... Well, uh...
The stork. You know. Uh, no?
- Well, uh...
- What he's trying to say, lassie, is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.
Bairn?
He means a baby, Miss Lady.
Oh.
What's a baby?
[Jock] Well, they resemble humans.
[Trusty] But I'd say a mite smaller.
[Jock] Aye. And they walk on all fours.
[Trusty] And if I remember correctly, they bellow a lot.
Aye. And they're very expensive.
You will not be permitted to play with it.
But they're mighty sweet.
And very, very soft.
Just a cute little bundle. [chuckles]
[Tramp] Of trouble.
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...
Aw, but shucks.
Any dog can take that.
It's what they do to your happy home.
Move it over, will you, friend?
Homewreckers, that's what they are.
Look here, laddie.
Who are you to barge in?
The voice of experience, buster.
[chuckles] Just wait till junior gets here.
You get the urge for a nice comfortable scratch, and, "Put that dog out!"
He'll get fleas all over the baby."
You start barking at some strange mutt.
[barks]
"Stop that racket.
You'll wake the baby."
And then!
Then they hit you in the room and board department.
Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef?
[Tramp] Forget them.
Leftover baby food.
And that nice, warm bed by the fire?
[chuckles]
[thunderclap]
A leaky doghouse.
- Oh, dear.
- Do not listen, lassie.
No human is that cruel.
Of course not, Miss Lady.
Why, everybody knows a dog's best friend is his human.
[Tramp laughing]
Oh, come on now, fellas.
You haven't fallen for that old line, now have you?
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels and their radical ideas.
Off with you, now. Off with you!
- OK, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.
- OK, Jock.
- Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!
OK, OK, OK.
But remember this, Pigeon.
A human heart has only so much room for love and affection.
When a baby moves in, the dog moves out.
[Jim] Uh-huh.
Oh, let's see. That'll be about...
Oh, well.
[pounding]
[Jim] Darling?
There isn't any way we can tell for sure what it's going to be, is there?
[Darling] I'm afraid not.
Nobody ever knows for certain.
All we can do is hope.
[chiming]
[footsteps]
[yawning]
[wind howling]
[door closes]
Darling, are you sure you want watermelon?
[Darling] Mm-hmm.
Oh, and some chop suey too.
Chop su...
[sighs] Oh, all right, darling.
[door shuts]
[women giggling and chattering]
[woman 1]... the cutest thing.
- [woman 2] Those booties!
- [woman 3] That bonnet.
- [woman 4] Adorable.
- [woman 5] Don't you love showers?
[woman 6] I've never seen you more beautiful.
[woman 7] Isn't she radiant?
[woman 8] That's just what I told Bill.
"Bill", I said, "Darling looks positively radiant."
In all my days,
"I've never seen anyone as radiant."
[men laughing]
[man 1] Aw, Jim, you look terrible.
[man 2] Absolutely horrible.
[man 3] I never saw you look worse.
[man 4] Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones has never lost a father yet.
[laughter]
[thunderclap]
[Jim] Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy.
Uh-huh, a boy. And...
What's that?
Eyes?
Oh, what colour are they?
Well... Oh, gosh. l-I forgot to look.
A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor!
Doctor, it's a boy!
Yes, yes, I know.
Uh-huh, a boy.
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy!
[Aunt Sarah on phone]
Hello? Hello, Jim?
Are you there, Jim?
Central, we've been cut off.
Hello? Hello?
Hello!
[baby crying]
[crying continues]
[thinking] What is a baby?
I just can't understand
It must be something wonderful
It must be something grand
Cos everybody's smiling
In a kind and wistful way
And they haven't even noticed
That I am around today
[Jim whistling]
[thinking] What is a baby, anyway?
[baby crying]
Oh, what is a baby?
I must find out today
What makes Jim Dear and Darling
Act this way?
[baby cooing]
[Darling humming]
Oh, my little star sweeper
I'll sweep the stardust
For you
[humming]
Little soft, fluffy sleeper
Here comes a pink cloud
For you
[humming]
Little wandering angel
Fold up your wings
Close your eyes
[humming]
And may love be your keeper
[humming]
There, now.
Little star sweeper.
Dream on.
Well, that should do it.
We've got enough here to take us halfway to China.
[grunting]
[Jim] Darling. Darling!
We haven't much time.
[Darling] Jim, I just can't leave him.
He's still so small and helpless.
[Jim] He'll be all right.
Now come on. If he wakes up we'll never get away.
Jim, I feel so guilty deserting him like this.
[Jim] Nonsense.
[Jim] Hey.
What's the matter with Lady?
[Darling] She thinks we're running out on him.
[Jim] Oh, don't worry, old girl.
We'll be back in a few days.
[Darling] And Aunt Sarah will be here.
- [Jim] With you here to help her...
- [doorbell rings]
[Jim] There's the old girl now.
Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming!
[Sarah panting] Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.
- [Jim] Let me take your things.
- No, no.
No fussing. I know my way around.
On your way, now.
Mustn't miss your train.
Have a good time, and don't worry about a thing.
Goodbye, dears. Goodbye, goodbye.
[Jim and Darling] Goodbye.
[Sarah] Now to see that big nephew of mine.
- Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
- [cooing]
Oh, you adorable little...
[gasps] Good gracious!
What are you doing here?
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
Scat. Get out of here.
- [baby crying]
- Aw, there, there.
Aunt Sarah won't let that dog frighten you anymore.
No, no, no.
[baby crying]
[Sarah] Rock-a-bye, baby
on the treetop
When the wind blows
We are Siamese
if you please
[purring]
We are Siamese
if you don't please
Now we looking over
our new domicile
If we like we stay
for maybe quite a while
[barking]
Do you seeing that thing swimming round and round?
Yesss.
Maybe we can reaching in and make it drown.
If we sneaking up upon it carefully...
There will be a head
for you, a tail for me
[crashing]
[baby crying]
Do you hear what I hear?
[purrs] A baby cry.
Where we're finding baby
there are milk nearby
If we look in baby buggy
there could be
Plenty milk for you
and also some for me
[growling]
- [screeching]
- [barking]
[Sarah] What's going on down there?
[gasps] Merciful heavens! My darlings.
- My precious pets.
- [yowling]
Oh. Ooh, that wicked animal.
Attacking my poor, innocent little angels.
[man] Good afternoon, ma'am.
What can I do for you?
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Now here's our latest.
Combination leash and muzzle.
Now, we'll just slip it on like this, and... No! No, no, no.
Nice doggy. No, don't wiggle.
Steady, now.
Now... Now, now.
Careful, you little...
[Sarah] Watch out.
- [man] Careful, doggy.
- [Sarah] Come back!
Get over here, I say.
Come back here.
[horn beeping]
[horn beeping]
[streetcar bell ringing]
[barking]
[snarling]
[growling]
[whimpering]
[panting, snorts]
Hey, Pige, what are you doing on this side of the tracks?
I thought you...
Wh?
Aw, you poor kid.
Oh, we've got to get this off.
Hmm.
I think I know the very place.
Come on.
Well, here we are.
- The zoo?
- Sure.
No, no. This way.
Follow me.
[guard humming]
- [Lady] Oh.
- What's the matter, Pige?
- We can't go in.
- Why not?
- [Lady] The sign says...
- [Tramp] Yeah, well, that's...
- That's the angle.
- Angle?
Look. We'll just wait for the right...
Uh-oh. Here we are now.
Just lay low.
[whistling]
[barking]
- [guard] Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.
- Were you addressing?
- What's the matter? Can't you read?
Why, yes, in several languages.
Oh, a wise guy, eh?
All right, now, what's this creature doing here?
- He's not my dog.
- Oh, he's not, eh?
Go away. Get down.
Go on. Why, certainly not, officer.
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next it was the dog that was whistling, eh?
- [man] I'm certain I don't know.
- Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?
Well, you listen to me.
A-ha! Resisting an officer of the law.
You're gonna pay.
Ow!
Pull a knife on me, will you?
Trying to assassinate me, you are.
Carrying concealed weapons.
[arguing continues]
Come on, Pige.
The place is ours.
[arguing continues]
We better go through this place from A to Z.
Apes.
No, no. No use even asking them.
They wouldn't understand.
They wouldn't?
Uh-uh. Too closely related to humans.
Uh-oh.
[Tramp] Alligators.
Now there's an idea.
Say, Al, do you suppose you could nip this contraption off for us?
[echoing] Glad to oblige.
Whoa. Whoa!
[hysterical laughter]
Ha! If anybody ever needed a muzzle, it's him.
- [animal] Timber!
- Pigeon, look out!
Now what harebrained idiot would...
Hey, look. A beaver.
There's the answer to our problem.
Let me see here.
Six-foot-six and seven-sixteenth inches.
Pardon me, friend.
- I wonder if you'd do us a little...
- Busy, sonny. Busy.
Can't stop to gossip now.
Got to slide this sycamore to the... [straining]
...swamp.
Well, this will only take a second.
Only a second? Listen, sonny.
Do you realise every second,
70 centimetres of water is wasted over that spillway?
- [Tramp] Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.
Gotta get it moving.
Think the cuttin' takes the time?
It's the doggone haulin'.
[straining]
[Tramp] The haulin'. Exactly.
- Now, what you need...
- I'd better bisect this section here.
What you need is a log puller.
[shouting] I said a log puller!
I ain't deaf, sonny.
There's no need to...
Did you say log puller?
And by a lucky coincidence you see before you, modelled by the lovely little lady, the new, improved, patented, handy dandy, never-fail little giant log puller.
The busy beaver's friend.
You don't say?
Guaranteed not to wear, tear, rip or ravel.
Turn around and show the customer the merchandise.
And it cuts log-hauling time 66 per cent.
Sixty-six per cent, eh?
[giggles] Think of that.
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.
You merely slip this ring over the limb like this, and haul it off.
Uh, say...
You mind if I slip it on for size?
Help yourself, friend.
OK. Don't mind if I do.
How do you get the consarned thing off, sonny?
Glad you brought that up, friend.
To remove it, simply place the strap between your teeth...
Like this?
Correct, friend. Now bite hard.
You see?
It's off.
Say, that is simple.
Well, friend, we'll be on our way now, so...
Uh-uh. Not so fast now, sonny...
I'll have to make certain it's satisfactory before we settle on a price.
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.
You can keep it.
I can, eh?
I can?
Uh-huh. It's a free sample.
Well, thanks a lot.
[chuckles] Thanks ever so...
Say!
It works swell.
[Lady] But when she put that horrible muzzle on me...
Say no more. I get the whole picture.
Aunts. Cats. Muzzles.
Well, that's what comes of tying yourself down to one family.
Haven't you a family?
One for every day of the week.
The point is, none of them have me.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
It's simple.
You see... [sniffing]
Hey. [sniffing]
Something tells me it's suppertime.
Come on. I'll show you what I mean.
Now take the Schultzes here.
Little Fritzie, that's me, Pige, makes this his Monday home.
- Monday home?
- Ach, ja.
[with German accent]
Monday is Mama Schultz cooking der Wiener Schnitzel.
Mmm.
Delicious.
[Irish accent] O'Brien's is where little Mike, that's me again, Pige,
- comes every Tuesday.
- Every Tuesday?
Begorra. And that's when they're havin' their darlin' corned beef.
You see, Pige, when you're footloose and collar-free, well, you take nothing but the best.
- [singing in Italian]
- Hey!
Tony's!
Of course.
The very place for a very special occasion.
This way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.
Wait here.
Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm...
What's a-matter? Somebody's a-makin' da April Fool with...
[barking]
Oh, hello, Butch.
Where you been so long?
Hey, Joe, look who's here.
Well, what do you know? It's Butch.
Hey, hey, hey!
Joe, bring some bones for Butchy before he eat me up.
- [chuckling]
- OK, Tony. OK.
Bones a-coming up.
[barking]
Huh?
Ahh!
What's this?
Hey, Joe, look.
Butchy, he's got a new girlfriend.
Well, a son of a gun!
He's a got a cockerel Spanish a-girl.
Hey, she's a pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.
You take-a Tony's advice and a-settle down with this-a one, eh?
"This a-one"?
This one. This... Oh!
Tony, you know.
He's a-not a-speaking
English a-pretty good.
[chuckles, clears throat]
Now, first we fix-a the table.
- Here's your bones, Tony.
- OK, bones. Bones?
[Tony] What's the matter with you,
Joe? I break-a your face.
Tonight, Butch, he gets the best in the house.
[Joe] OK, Tony, you're the boss.
Now, tell me, what's your pleasure?
A la carte? Dinner?
[barking]
A-ha. OK.
Hey, Joe.
Butch-a, he says he wants-a two spaghetti speciale.
Heavy on the meats-a ball.
Tony, dogs don't talk.
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- OK, he's a-talkin' to you.
You the boss.
Mamma mia. [grumbling in Italian]
Now here you are.
The best spaghetti in town.
[slurping]
For this is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it
Bella notte
Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte
Side by side
With your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near
For
[both] This is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely
Bella notte
[chorus] This is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it
Bella notte
Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely
Bella notte
Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near
For this is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely
Bella notte
[rooster crowing]
Oh! Oh, dear.
Is something wrong, Pige?
- It's morning.
- Yeah. [stretches]
So it is.
I should have been home hours ago.
Why? Because you still believe in that,
"in the faithful old dog tray" routine?
Aw, come on, Pige.
Open up your eyes.
Open my eyes?
To what a dog's life can really be.
I'll show you what I mean.
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.
Well, I see nice homes with yards and fences.
Exactly. Life on a leash.
Look again, Pige.
[Tramp] There's a great big hunk of world down there with no fence around it.
Where two dogs can find adventure and excitement.
And beyond those distant hills, who knows what wonderful experiences?
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.
It's all ours.
It sounds wonderful.
But?
But who'd watch over the baby?
You win.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
[man whistling]
[humming]
It's a beautiful night
And they call it...
[chickens clucking]
[Tramp] Not to change the subject, but...
Ever chased chickens?
I should say not!
Oh, ho! Then you've never lived.
- But we shouldn't.
- I know.
That's what makes it fun.
Aw, come on, kid.
Start building some memories.
But we... We won't hurt the chickens?
Hurt 'em? No!
[Tramp] We'll just stir 'em up a bit.
[Tramp] Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.
Why, they should've been up hours ago.
[barking]
[squawking]
Some fun, eh, kid?
[man] Hey, what's going on in there?
- [gunshot]
- What's that?
That's the signal to get going. Come on.
[gunshots]
- This is living, eh, kid?
- Is it?
Come on, Pige. Follow me.
You know, there's a little bit of bird dog in all of us, eh, Pige?
Pige? Pige?
Pige? Where are you, Pige?
Pige?
[echoing] Pigeon?
Oh, Pige!
[dogs howling and barking]
[howling mournful tune]
[howling continues]
[whimpering]
[dog] Hey.
Hey, Dachsie, how we coming?
Just one more chorus and we're out.
OK. On a downbeat.
- One, two...
- [clanking]
[man] Put her in number four, Bill,
- while I check her license.
- OK.
[Bill] All right, baby, in here.
Well, look yous guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.
[chuckles] Blimey.
A regular bloomin' debutante.
Yeah. And pipe the crown jewel she's wearin'.
Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart?
Putting fleas on the butler?
All right, you guys. Lay off, will you?
Aw, what's the matter, Peg?
We was only havin' a bit of sport, we was.
Can't you see the poor kid's scared enough already?
Pay no attention, my little ochi chernye.
That's right, dearie.
They don't mean no real harm.
It's like Gorky says in Lower Depths, quote:
"Miserable being must find more miserable being.
Then he's happy."
- Unquote.
- Boris is a philosopher.
Besides, little bublichki, wearing license here, that is like waving, you should excuse the expression, red flag in front of bull.
My license?
But what's wrong with it?
There ain't nothin' wrong with it, dearie.
Confidential, there's not one dog here who would not give left hind leg for such a knick-knack.
That's your passport to freedom, honey.
- Without it...
- [clanking]
Hey. Hey, yous guys, look.
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.
[Lady] Where is he taking him?
[dog] Through the one-way door, sister.
[door locking]
You... You mean he's...
Oh, well.
A short life and a merry one.
Yeah, that's what the Tramp always says.
- The Tramp?
- Now there's a bloke what never gets caught.
He's given the slip to every dogcatcher in this burg.
You won't believe this, dearie, but no matter how tight a jam he's in, that Tramp always finds some way out.
I can quite easily believe that.
Ah, but remember, my friends, even Tramp has his Achilles heel.
Pardon me, amigo.
What is this "chilli heel"?
Achilles heel, Pedro.
This is meaning his, uh, weaknesses.
Oh. Oh, the dames. Yeah.
[chuckles] He has an eye for a well-turned paw, he has.
Let's see. There's been Lulu.
[dog] Yeah, and Trixie.
[Dachsie] Und Fifi.
And my sister,
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.
I think.
What a dog.
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.
What a dog!
Peg used to be in the Dog and Pony Follies.
He's a tramp
But they love him
Breaks a new heart every day
He's a tramp
They adore him
And I only hope he'll stay that way
- He's a tramp
- [howling]
He's a scoundrel
- He's a rounder
- [whimpering]
He's a cad
He's a tramp
But I love him
Yes, even I have got it pretty bad
- [howling]
- You can never tell
When he'll show up
He gives you plenty of trouble
I guess he's just a no-count pup
But I wish that he were double
- He's a tramp
- Bum-bum-bum-ruff
- He's a rover
- Bum-bum-bum-ruff
And there's nothin' more to say
Bum-bum-bum-ruff
[Peg] If he's a tramp
He's a good one
And I wish that
I could travel his way
Wish that I could travel his way
Wish that I could travel his way
Yeah.
But he never takes them serious.
Ah, but someday he is meeting someone different.
[Boris] Some delicate, fragile creature who's giving him a wish to shelter and protect.
Like Miss Park Avenue here, eh, matey?
Mm-hmm. Could be.
- But when he does...
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.
Under the spell of true love...
The poor chump grows careless...
The Cossacks are picking him up...
And it's curtains for the Tramp.
[door opens]
[man] It's the little cocker, Bill.
- In number four.
- [Bill] OK.
All right, baby.
They've come to take you home.
You're too nice a girl to be in this place.
Courage, man.
Courage!
But, uh...
I've never even considered matrimony.
Nor I.
But no matter which of us she accepts, we'll always be the best of friends.
Now remember, not a word about her unfortunate experience.
- We don't want to hurt her feelings.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
Lassie.
Miss Lady, ma'am.
Please, I don't want to see anybody.
Now, now, lassie.
Don't feel that way about it.
Of course not, Miss Lady.
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down
- were jailbirds.
- [Jock] Quiet!
You great loony!
Uh, please, lassie.
We've come with a proposition.
[Jock] For helpin' ya.
Help me? What do you mean?
Well, now...
You see, lassie...
Neither of us is as young as we used to be.
But we're still in the prime of life.
Aye.
And we've both got very comfortable homes.
[Trusty] That's right. Where we know you'll be welcome and appreciated, Miss Lady.
So... So, to come directly to the point...
[clears throat]
If you could, uh, find it possible to, uh...
To, uh...
You're both very kind, and I do appreciate it.
- But...
- [Tramp] Oh, Pigeon.
Oh, Pi...
[Tramp] Oh! Oh, hi, boys.
Anything new in the kennel club set?
[chuckling]
A little something
I picked up for you, Pige.
Hmpf.
Looks like I'm the one that's in the doghouse.
If this person is annoying you, Miss Lady...
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.
That won't be necessary. Thank you.
Very well, ma'am.
You... You...
...mongrel!
Aw, come on, Pige.
- It wasn't my fault.
- Hmpf.
I thought you were right behind me. Honest.
When I heard they'd taken you to the pound...
Don't even mention that horrible place.
[sobbing] I was so embarrassed and...
- And frightened.
- Oh, now, now.
Who could ever harm a cute little trick like you?
[Lady] Trick? Trick!
- That reminds me, who is Trixie?
- Trixie?
And Lulu and Fifi and Rosita Chiquita wh...
- Whatever her name is.
- Chiquita...
Oh! Yes! Well, l-I...
As far as I'm concerned, you needn't worry about your old heel.
[stammering] My heel?
I don't need you to shelter and protect me.
- But...
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.
I don't care if the Cossacks do pick you up! Goodbye.
- And take this with you.
- [thunderclap]
[Lady sobbing]
[board banging]
[thunderclap]
[growling]
[barking]
[barking]
Stop that.
Hush, now, hush.
[barking continues]
[Sarah] Stop that racket!
[Tramp] What's wrong?
- A rat!
- Where?
Upstairs, in the baby's room!
- How do I get in?
- The little door.
On the porch.
[thunderclap]
[sniffing]
[growling]
[snarling]
[barking]
[squeaking]
[squeaking]
[baby crying]
- [crashing]
- [squeaking]
[crying continues]
[gasping] Merciful heavens!
Oh! Oh, you poor little darling.
No, no, no.
Thank goodness you're not hurt.
You... You vicious brutes. Back!
Get back!
Go on! Get back!
The pound. The pound, that's it.
I'll call the pound.
[barking]
Come here, you. Come here!
Come on, come on.
Come along.
I'll call them this minute.
[whimpering]
I won't sleep with that brute in the house.
[barking]
[telephone ringing]
[Sarah] Hello? Hello!
[whimpering]
I don't care if you are alone there, young man.
I insist you pick him up immediately.
[bell rings]
[Jim] Darling, look.
[Sarah] If you want my advice you'll destroy that animal at once.
[man] Don't worry, ma'am.
We've been after this one for months.
We'll take care of him.
- [Darling] What do you suppose?
- [Jim] What's going on here?
[man] Just picking up a stray, mister.
Come on, giddup. [whip cracks]
Caught him attacking a baby.
- [Jim] Heavens.
- My baby.
[both] Aunt Sarah!
[Darling] Aunt Sarah!
[both] Aunt Sarah!
I was certain he was no good the moment I first laid eyes on him.
Yeah, but, uh...
I never thought he'd do a thing like that.
[Sarah] I got there in time.
There they were...
[Jim] I'm sure there must be some mistake. Lady wouldn't...
[barking]
[Sarah] Watch out! That dog's loose.
Keep her away.
[Jim] Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.
- [barking continues]
- What is it, old girl?
What are you try...
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.
- [Darling] What is it?
- [Sarah gasps]
[Sarah] Aaah! A rat!
A rat?
We should've known.
I misjudged him.
Badly.
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.
But man, we don't know which way they've gone.
We'll track 'em down.
And then?
We'll hold 'em.
Hold 'em at bay.
Now what?
The scent. Follow the scent.
Ach. Let's face it, man.
We both know you've lost your sense of smell.
[howling]
[howling continues]
[howling]
[howling]
- [man] Get out of here.
- [barking]
Go on, get away.
[barking]
Easy. Go on, get away.
Watch it now. Watch it!
[horn honking]
[crowd murmuring]
Hi, Pige.
[whimpering]
[howling]
[Jim] All right, everybody, watch the birdy.
[growling]
- [squeaking]
- Steady, now.
[Jim] Hold it.
[coughing]
I guess I used a little too much.
Uh-oh.
Darling, visitors.
Visitors?
[Darling] Why, it's Jock.
[Jim] And good old Trusty.
Careful now, man.
Careful. It's a wee bit slippery.
[Trusty] Yes, it is.
[Jim] All right, boy. We'll let 'em in.
No, no, not you, young man.
You're going to take a nap.
Well, Merry Christmas.
Come in, come in.
If you'll just step into the parlour
[Jim] I'll see about refreshments.
Oh, darling, where did you put the dog biscuits?
The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.
[Darling] In the kitchen, Jim dear.
Oh, no doubt about it.
They've got their mother's eyes.
Aye. [chuckles]
But there's a bit of their father in them too.
Well, and I see you finally acquired a collar.
Oh. Yes.
Complete with license.
Oh, yeah, a new collar.
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.
[Trusty] Trusty, I says,
Trusty, somebody's wearing a new collar.
'Course, my sense of smell is very highly developed.
Runs in the family, you know.
There'll be no livin' with him from now on.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
[all] No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.
Huh?
I haven't?
Well, um...
As Old Reliable used to say...
He'd say, uh...
He'd say... uh...
Uh...
Hmm.
Doggone.
You know,
I clean forgot what it was he used to say.
[chuckling]
[chorus] Peace, my children
Of good will
Peace, my children
Peace
Be
Still
[Bella Notte]
Hello, I'm Mr. Conductor, and I'm going to tell you a story about trains, folks far apart and the magic railroad that brought them together,
Every story, like a railroad, has its heroes.
Meet Thomas, he's our number one hero.
Hello!
But he's running a little late today.
This is the island of Sodor where Thomas and his friends live.
It's at one end of my special universe.
- Hello, Thomas.
- Hello, James.
-I like helping out here.
By the invitation of
Sir Topham Hatt, of course.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Who do we appreciate?
Practicing your numbers, Gordon.
That's a good engine.
I'm counting how many seconds late you are.
What does that sign say?
Hmm...
"Sodor Railway.
"Really reliable and right on time."
Signed, "Head of the railway,
Sir Topham Hatt."
But you weren't on time, little Thomas.
And you're being bossy, Gordon.
Please excuse me.
I'm meeting Mr. Conductor.
He's looking after us while Sir Topham Hatt takes a much needed holiday.
I think we can take care of ourselves.
Get out of my way!
I have unfinished business here and I wanna finish it fast!
Diesel 10's back!
Yes, ten out of ten for devious deeds and brutal strength.
The blast from the past who hates steam engines.
Maybe we do need
Mr. Conductor here after all.
On time!
At the other end of my universe, far away across oceans of time, up and over Muffle Mountain and hidden deep in a valley, is my hometown,
Shining Time.
# Every now and then
# There appears a sign
# That points just round the bend
# To a place you'll find
# Covered in clover
# The magic comes over you
# Showing up right on time
# This is your Shining Time
# Climbing through stars to
# Your own cloud nine
# Soft strokes of lightning
# Paint the skies brightening
# Up all your Shining Time
And by the way, I think you're going to help me and Thomas somewhere in this story.
If Diesel has unfinished business, there's sure to be trouble right around the corner.
Sandal, fly! Boo, fly!
Shoo, fly! That's it!
Better still, buzz off.
Botheration!
You weren't concentrating, Thomas.
Lucky for you that the buffers were there.
That's what buffers are for, to stop engines from crashing.
Why are you in the sheds, James?
I'm feeling a little blue.
Which isn't so hot when you're red.
I was naughty and Sir Topham Hatt told me to think about all the ways
I can be Really Useful.
Then I can come out again.
He's just trying to make this a better railway for steam engines.
He says, the harder we work, the less he'll need diesels to help.
Help you?
You'll always need help!
Because steam engines are cowardly, cranky, wornout hunks of metal who couldn't hurt a fly.
- No, we're not!
- Yes, you are!
- Aren't!
- Are!
- Now, I've come back to find a lost steam engine.
I'm gonna destroy her and dominate you!
And then you'll be nothing but useless scrap!
Right, Pinchy?
Big bully! Stinker!
We're Really Useful engines!
You won't dominate us and you won't destroy her!
We won't let you.
Neither will Mr. Conductor.
I'm off to fetch him now.
What lost engine?
There, Mutt, the paint job's finished.
I reckon Shining Time has the best welcome sign of any town in our valley.
I'm glad you agree.
Billy's old map sure helped a lot.
He's on his way back now, is he?
You hear that train whistle sooner than it hears itself.
Fine work, Patch.
Thanks.
Oh, I've been looking at your map.
What are these mysterious shadowy lines?
They look like straight railroad tracks, but I can't see any tracks around here, except the ones you travel on.
It's mysteries that make this land so...
Magical?
I better be off to Muffle Mountain.
I promised Mr. Stone that I'd clean his yard.
Does Burnett Stone ever give you a smile?
No, but he doesn't frighten my horse, either.
Which means,
I don't think he's a bad man.
I think he's just sad.
I didn't know that in
Muffle Mountain there was a secret that Burnett had shared only with his childhood friend, Tasha.
One day, Tasha, I'm going to drive this engine.
And I'll take you with me.
Promise you will,
Burnett. Promise!
I promise.
This engine was vital to the magic that held these worlds together, but only Burnett knew that.
Hello. Shining Time Station.
Manager Stacy Jones speaking.
Oh, yes, the 10:15 from
Pelican Falls to Shining Time is right on schedule.
-You're welcome.
The 10:00 to Lucy's Leap is leaving now.
Oh, Billy, I found this child's drawing in an old locker in the lost and found.
Look at the signature, Billy.
Burnett Stone!
It's hard to believe Burnett could have ever looked that happy.
Burnett had a wonderful smile.
And he loved railroading, too.
How did you find me here?
I found the entrance to your workshop ages ago.
But I would never tell anybody.
See that switch on the wall?
Flip it on.
I guessed there was something mysterious about this mountain.
Yeah. All mountains have their secrets, Patch.
Shouldn't surprise a kid like you.
Could I help you,
Mr. Stone?
Sure. You can help me dust her off.
This engine's name is Lady.
Why is she locked up?
She isn't.
She's safe from harm.
Long ago, I made a mistake as Lady's caretaker.
An evil diesel found Lady and threatened to destroy her.
He chased her and used up all her coal.
He made her go too fast and then he crashed her.
Then I brought her here.
I tried my best to fix her up but I've never been able to make up for the mistake I made.
And I've never been able to bring her to life.
To make her steam.
Patch, she's as precious as gold.
Pinchy, you captured the real me.
That's beautiful. I could cry.
- Boss?
- We're here.
Listen, you two.
I've got a job for you,
Splodge.
- Actually, it's Splatter.
- And Dodge.
I ain't got time to say both names!
Oh, well.
I've come back to find a steam engine.
That's easy.
Yeah, they're everywhere.
Not the one I want.
She escaped me once before.
As long as she exists, so do the others.
But if she can be destroyed...
Destroyed.
Did you say the destroyed?
Yeah, destroyed!
There's one problem.
Mr. Conductor's coming, and he won't let you destroy.
I can do whatever I want!
I'll get him, too!
With Pinchy!
Ow! Pinchy,
I hate it when you do that!
- Hello, Mr. Conductor.
- Hello, Billy.
Tool kit? Check.
Ticket puncher?
Check-check.
All aboard!
Just testing, Billy.
Mustn't let my conducting skills get rusty.
Important day, Mr. C?
It is a very important day!
I'm going to the island of Sodor.
It's the only place in my universe where I fit in size-wise.
Sir Topham Hatt has given me a big responsibility.
Diesel 10 is back and I have to make sure he behaves himself.
Excuse me, Billy.
I hope your visit goes well, Mr. C.
Thank you.
I must be responsible, reliable and...
Don't tell me.
Really Useful. I knew that.
Well, Thank you, Moby Dick.
I like my sparkle, too.
You know, gold really is your color.
Stacy, where did you find this painting?
In an old locker. It was done by Burnett Stone when he was a child.
I was told that he used to work on this railroad.
But he never leaves the other side of the mountain now.
You seem puzzled,
Mr. Conductor.
Well, I am puzzled.
This place looks like the island of Sodor but how would
Burnett Stone travel there without gold dust?
Sparkle's been the only way to make the trip since the lost engine disappeared.
Anyway, I just came to say goodbye.
I have to go now.
Right now?
Yes. I have to make sure everything's safe and sound on the island of Sodor just as I try to do here.
Like Stacy, Mutt sensed danger, he didn't want either
Billy or me to leave
Shining Time.
Old Smoky, you stay right here until I get back.
Ah, there you are.
Is something wrong here?
Ah!
I'm going to be late.
I'll get back as fast as I can.
I have to concentrate now, Mutt.
I'm suddenly having problems with my sparkle.
Mutt?
-Goodbye, Mutt.
-Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.
Mr. Conductor, where are you?
I know you live far away, but you always seem to get here on time.
Oh, Mr. Conductor!
Are you all right?
Yes, Thomas. But sometimes everything happens at once.
I have to see Sir Topham Hatt to get my orders right away.
The journey from Shining Time keeps getting bumpier and bumpier.
- A big bully Diesel is back.
- You had better be careful.
Sir Topham Hatt warned me about Diesel.
Don't worry, Thomas.
I'll just pop in and out with my sparkle wherever he goes and keep him in order.
I hope.
# Old MacDiesel had a plan
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee
# A pinch-pinch here, and a pinch-pinch there
Here a pinch, there a pinch #
I crack myself up.
Tasha, the Conductor family has a little steam engine, with her own railroad, and has wonderful energy because of it.
But a diesel wants to destroy her.
And without her, the Conductor's universe will vanish.
The man with the sparkle told me that one day, one of his family will return, but until then,
"To guard her well, young Burnett."
But I didn't guard you well.
I just don't seem to understand about...
About magic anymore.
This is where
Burnett's granddaughter,
Lily, comes into our story.
She lives with her mom and dad in the big city, a few hours train ride from Shining Time.
She sees magic no one else has time to, like lovely reflections of light on a rainy day.
Soon, she was off to stay with her grandpa on Muffle Mountain,
Grandpa's been so sad since Grandma Tasha died and he never comes here to see us.
Well, maybe your visit will cheer him up. Hmm?
Did you get his present?
Here. I'm making him a friendship bracelet.
Honey, that's beautiful.
But I'd rather just stay here with you.
I know. Come here.
- I'm gonna go up this way.
- Okay.
- Be careful.
- You always say that.
See you in a minute.
You're coming with me to Grandpa's, Bluebird.
I know how much you like to travel.
Faraway on Sodor, the steam engines were confident, cheerful, and determined not to be bullied by Diesel.
Only James, who now felt
Really Useful too, was complaining.
- Wobbly wheels.
- Puffy pistons.
Thomas,
I should have collected Mr. Conductor!
James is right, little Thomas.
Collecting Mr. Conductor is an important job.
Important is big.
James is a big engine.
You, Thomas, are small!
Small, small, small.
Teeny, weenie, weenie.
And I am a big, blue engine who knows everything.
Bossy sprockets!
All that steam has gone to your funnel!
- There they are.
- We'll fix their wagons.
I'm no good at backing up.
Me neither.
What's important is to stand up on our own wheels to Diesel.
Diesel knows that the lost engine in the legend really exists.
- What engine?
- What legend?
An engine whose magic makes her more powerful than Diesel will ever be.
That's why he wants to find her.
Then we'd better find her first.
Leave it to the big engines,
Percy.
Little engines can do big things.
Especially when they have nice blue paint like me.
Hey, just watch what happens to that blue puffball...
When Harold the flopper chopper flies past here.
Right!
Routine fly-by, chaps. Hello.
The boss dumped sneezing powder everywhere.
Let's start laughing now.
Oh, sorry, fellas.
A bit of a dust up.
Love to stay and clean up.
Got to go. Bye.
Did you mean to look like that?
- No.
- Neither did I.
This must be
Diesel's doing!
Toot!
"Where were you?
"My wife said she couldn't miss our little holiday.
"We'll telephone to make sure you have arrived."
Signed, "Sir Topham Hatt."
Sir Topham Hatt.
Where were you?
Good afternoon, sir.
A real honor, sir.
Like my family before me.
And how is Lady Hatt?
Yes. Watch out for Diesel.
Definitely.
Keep an eye on Henry's health.
Certainly.
Yes, sir, the three R's, reading, writing and arithmetic.
I mean...
I will be responsible, reliable and Really Useful.
Yes, sir.
We will all get a good night's sleep.
Looking forward to a hard day tomorrow.
Goodbye, sir.
So, who dropped the ball then?
Oh, there you are.
I'd like a nice cup of hot cocoa.
Would you fellas care to join me?
No.
Go outside and play?
Well, I can understand that.
What do you think?
Why do you keep hitting him like that?
You need a time out.
Just a little sweeter, I think.
All right, Pinchy, my little bucket of badness, time to feast yourself.
Ah! Now that's better.
Cinders and ashes!
It's Diesel!
Oh, no!
Hello, Twinkle Toes!
I've got a plan and you're not in it!
-You can't catch me, Diesel!
- Losing your sparkle, huh?
- What perfect timing.
You won't find her here.
You're not clever enough to stop me.
Oh, yes, I am!
No, you're not. Is that...
That's right.
It's sugar, Diesel.
And if I throw this in your tank, it'll seize you up for good.
Make the most of tonight,
Twinkle Toes, because you won't like tomorrow!
Neither will that line of tin kettles!
Shut up, Pinchy.
Mr. Conductor, but what happened to your sparkle?
I don't know, Thomas.
I'll just have to sleep on that.
On your sparkle?
No, Thomas.
On the problem of what happened to it.
But, Mr. Conductor, without your sparkle or the lost engine, you can't travel here to help us anymore.
I'll solve the problem.
You just go to sleep now.
Easy for you to say.
Sparkle, gold dust, magic, railroad, buffers, lost engine.
The family told me, as long as there is a railroad, there will be harmony.
As long as there is gold dust, there will be energy.
You will never have to worry.
Yeah, sure.
Mr. C?
Mr. C!
Why aren't you here?
Why couldn't you travel anymore to the island of Sodor or back home here to us in Shining Time?
The magic is all gone.
What's going wrong with our railroad and why?
My universe is in danger.
I've got to find more gold dust!
Next morning,
Mutt traveled with Billy to the big city station.
Mutt was sure Lily could help her grandpa, and that together they could help me, but only if Lily met someone special at Shining Time first.
The train for Muffle Mountain will depart from Track 3, last stop, Muffle Mountain.
The train for Shining Time will depart from Track 4.
I don't suppose you know where Track 3 is, do you?
You do?
Well, why not?
-I hope you're right.
Mutt was feeling pleased with himself.
He had put Lily on the wrong train but he knew he had done so for the right reasons.
# I know how the moon must feel
# Looking down from the heavens
# Smiling at the silly things
# We put ourselves through
# Missing magic each day
# And not seeing the wonder
# That's how the moon
# Must feel
# I know how the moon must feel
# When he makes someone happy
# That's the feeling I will feel
# When you smile at me
# I'll be floating on air
# I'll be beaming with wonder
# That's how the moon
# Must feel
Left a bit... Ah!
Right a bit.
Up a bit!
There, James.
Tickle all gone now?
No. Still itchy.
Hey, Mr. C, why do you look so tired?
Is it because I'm red?
Diesel says red is a very tiring color.
But, Mr. C, red looks so nice against the snow.
It's not me, is it?
No, of course not, James.
Red is bright and cheerful.
- Oh, good.
- Just like my sparkle.
Or at least it was, and must be again!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm going to the windmill to search for something important.
Now off to work, please.
Okay.
Keep your steam up.
What happened?
Where's the windmill?
That's where I'm supposed to be.
Now I've completely lost my sense of direction.
Oh...
Now my gold dust really is all gone.
If I can't find the source for making more, the consequences will be bad.
I saw them in my dream last night.
My family never told me what to do in a gold dust crisis.
They only said,
"If you can't remember the clue,
"the windmill will remind you."
But where is the windmill?
And what is the clue?
- Smile, you steamers.
- It's a sunny day.
It's not sunny,
'cause Mr. C's not at the windmill. I looked.
I think his sparkle's all gone.
My smoke box doesn't feel sunny.
It feels stuffed up.
Nasty fumes from dingy Diesel.
And Diesel is after the lost engine.
And if he finds her,
I fear that will destroy us all.
What, even an engine as big as me?
Yes, Gordon, even you.
Say it, don't spray it, Thomas.
I've still got sneezing powder up my funnel.
Now I'm going to look for Mr. Conductor.
Let us get back to work.
That's what he would want.
How about a race, Thomas?
Sorry, Bertie. I can't today.
I have to be a Really Useful engine and solve some mysteries instead.
I guess that means I win.
Perhaps another day.
What's that?
What's this?
"I notice you left your thinking cap behind.
"Try these instead.
They're good for the brain.
"Gone fishing. Rabbit."
Well, well, well!
How very thoughtful.
Plane, drain.
Mountain, fountain.
That might be something.
I think I'll try the celery.
Sausage, bicycle.
Toothpaste, beach.
Wait a minute.
Beach.
Beach! That's it! That's it!
I have to find a bellflower.
I need to make a call.
# It's a summer Sunday and I'm under
# A cloud that shades my happiest blunder
# Catching the wave of another
# This easy life Oh!
# I never thought that I
# Could ever give my life to one girl
# I feel like I'm finished
# Washed up and unaccomplished
# I've dissolved too soon
# Thinking of swimming on a Sunday
# To a lady more fair than the spray and the cool #
That's my shell phone!
Junior is that you?
Oh, hi, Cous.
Are you in a tunnel?
This isn't a very good line.
Where are you?
Hmm... I'm in paradise.
I got on cloud nine, and here I am.
Listen to me,
You've got to come to the island of Sodor right now.
Now? But I'm waiting on the perfect wave!
Oh, no, you're not!
You're coming here.
You have to help me find the source of our family's gold dust.
What is the source?
That's the trouble.
I haven't a clue.
And I've used up most of my gold dust, too.
What?
Then go to
Shining Time Station first, and in my signal house, in the box under the staircase, you'll find my emergency whistle with the last of my supply.
Please take care of this and...
Don't talk to anyone about the buffers!
What buffers?
Shh!
This is a really bad line.
Hello!
My shell phone's not working properly.
You've got to come here right away!
I'm counting on you!
Hello?
I want my money back.
Shining Time?
What does that mean?
- Do you want me to get off here?
Where is everyone?
What have you brought me here for?
That's gonna leave a mark! Oh!
Maybe it's in here.
Oh, cake!
Ugh, that's not cake!
-How cute. Six little...
Five little glass figurines.
Ooh! Hello?
This is too much.
I've got to get back to the island.
I've got to get to cousin.
Hiya. Who are you?
I'm Lily. Who are you?
C. Junior.
Did I drop some sunglasses when I came in here?
I don't know.
Oh, well, I might as well use some more of this stuff.
See you, Lily.
What is this stuff?
The magic is gone.
Why did I take my gold dust for granted?
I can't help without my gold dust.
What is the source of my gold dust?
Is someone there?
Thomas, is that you?
Mr. Conductor?
-Mr. Conductor!
Oh, Mr. Conductor, where are you?
Thomas?
How could I possibly say that
I'm Really Useful now?
Excuse me. Are you Lily?
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Stacy Jones.
I'm manager here.
Your grandpa's very upset.
You must've gotten on the wrong train.
I'll take you to Muffle Mountain.
Thank you.
Stacy, did you know my grandma?
My mother did.
She said Tasha was a wonderful dancer.
I think Grandpa liked to call Grandma "Lady."
Lady?
Yes.
I heard him say that name when they were talking.
I wish...
Oh, never mind.
Turn right here, you can't miss it
Stacy, I'm a little nervous.
Well, maybe your grandpa is, too.
It's been a while since you've seen each other.
Thanks a lot.
Hello, Burnett.
Stacy.
Hello, Lily.
Hi, Grandpa.
Have a good evening.
Thanks, Stacy. Good night.
You said, "I wish..."
I wish?
Oh, yes.
I wish you'd come back and see us tomorrow at Shining Time.
If your grandpa lets you.
Here, Grandpa.
This is a friendship bracelet.
Grandma taught me how to make one when I was little.
This one's for you.
Thank you, Lily.
As the sound of Lady's magic echoed through the night on Muffle Mountain, the engines on Sodor had her very much in their thoughts,
Thomas, I was thinking.
How does Mr. Conductor travel here?
By gold dust.
But if there' s a lost engine, maybe there's a lost railway, too.
Mr. Conductor's railway!
The journey gets bumpier and bumpier.
That's what
Mr. Conductor told me.
Oh!
He talked about buffers in his sleep!
Buffers are at the end of a railway.
I think that's how he travels here, on a secret railway.
Belonging to the lost engine!
Percy, you are clever.
Oh! My wheels are suddenly feeling very wobbly.
I think Diesel's around here!
I'm sorry, you two.
Diesel heard every word you said.
I'm going after him to see what he does next.
You'd better get the mail delivered.
You're very brave, Toby.
Diesel won't bother with an old engine like me.
He thinks I'm really useless.
# I've been working on the railway
# All the livelong day #
Who wants to work a livelong day anyway?
There he is.
Come in! Come in and join the party, Splodge!
Hooray!
We're gonna have a party.
I love parties.
Who's got the balloons?
What?
Correction.
Join the party that's over.
Just like Twinkle Toe's magic railway is gonna be over.
Hmm.
Gone, like the lost engine and the buffers that lead to her.
What are you gonna do?
That's a good question.
It's time to put Twinkle Toes' lights out.
Ooh.
This is a job for the boss!
I've got to delay him.
I've got to distract him. Hmm.
- It's the old teapot!
- Smash him!
- Pinchy, get back here!
- I hate it when you do this!
Good show!
Uh, Boss, did you mean to let the roof fall in?
All the way in?
I always mean what I do, you rattle traps!
Diesel was in a dump, but the steam engines were still right on track.
# He's a Really Useful engine
You know
# All the other engines
They'll tell you so
# He huffs and puffs and whistles
# Rushing to and fro
# He's the Really Useful engine we adore
# He's a Really Useful engine
You know
# 'Cause the Fat Controller
He told him so
# Now he's got a workshop to call his very own
# He's the Really Useful engine we adore
# He's the one
# He's the number one
# Thomas the tank engine
# He's the Really Useful engine
# We adore
Morning, Henry.
What's the matter?
I've got boiler ache.
And I'm collecting one, two, three, four, five, six trucks of special island of
Sodor coal for you.
Oh, Thank you, Thomas.
Special coal will make me feel much better.
But I wish I could make Mr. Conductor feel better too, by finding him.
Hello, Thomas and your five coal trucks.
Five?
But I'm supposed to have six.
Hello, Percy.
Oh, Thomas,
I've been worried about you.
Bertie says you lost a coal truck today.
Yes. It disappeared when I was at the buffers near the little grotto.
Maybe those are the buffers that lead to the secret railway.
And the grotto is the lost engine's special platform!
Yes!
Percy, you protect those buffers from Diesel...
...and I'll find
Mr. Conductor.
- Because you're a brave engine, Percy.
Oh, I forgot.
- Hello, Twinkle Toes!
- Remember me?
Fat Hatt won't have much use for you looking like that.
Oh, I see you forgot to bring the sugar.
How careless of you.
Say hello to Pinchy!
Okay, Twinkle Toes,
I know about the buffers.
- That's what I saw in my dream!
- It's coming true!
My universe is starting to crumble!
And I know about the magic railway.
And when I find that engine, you and all those puffballs will be history!
Now tell me where the buffers are! Now!
-You got 10 seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
Too late, Diesel!
Did you put all this here for me?
You must've known that I was coming.
How kind of you.
Oh! I'm at the windmill.
That's what I call a perfect landing.
This must be the clue to unlock the source of the gold dust.
Where has the writing gone?
So, Boss...
How come you let
Twinkle Toes escape?
Oh, that!
Well, uh,
I did it on purpose.
I was testing him to see if he could escape.
- Liar, liar.
- Pants on fire.
All right!
Playtime's over, Splodge.
Uh-oh.
Now it's time for the next lesson, huh?
I call it
"How to stop being stupid."
That's gonna ruin my facial.
Oh.
Bet you can't climb that tree.
See?
-On my fire escape.
Hi. I'm Patch.
I'm Lily.
Do you live around here?
Yes.
My mom and dad run the stables.
- Morning, Patch.
- Good morning, Mr. Stone.
I'm riding into Shining Town.
Could Lily come with me?
- If she'd like to.
- I'd like to.
Sure, she can go.
Be back by sunset, Lily.
Do you wanna come, too?
I never go there now.
Bye, Grandpa.
So, have you ever ridden a horse before?
No.
I've always wanted to go this way.
We're following some shadowy lines
I've seen on a map.
They're like railroad tracks without any rails.
Well, Lady, what are we to do?
It all seemed so much easier when Tasha and I were children.
Junior?
Presto!
I'd given up on seeing you again.
What's blue, green and red and goes beep.
A parrot and you mean chirp-chirp.
No, trains. Talking trains.
And I'm off to see them right now in the island of
Sodor, and cousin.
But I overslept and I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Do you want to come?
Can we be back here by sunset?
I hope so.
I wanna get back to the beach.
- Okay.
- Good.
It's this way.
We'll take the shortcut.
-Hmm...
There's two of us.
Oh, well. That means
I'll have to use Cous' extra supply of gold dust.
It doesn't matter.
We'll have plenty more soon.
Can I take this little bit back for Grandpa?
Be my guest.
I'll take care of it for you.
Ready? Here goes.
You've grown bigger.
May be you're smaller.
I'm adjusting to my new surroundings.
This is the only place this ever happens to me.
Whoa!
A bit bouncy, isn't it?
-Conductor's railroad.
-Whatever.
We're traveling miles and miles to the island.
But I don't know if this railroad's gonna last much longer.
-It'll vanish like the engine.
The engine that used to travel on this railroad.
Cous and I never saw it.
We don't know what happened to it.
Hey, what's that doing there?
You ready, Lily?
Here are the buffers.
Now!
Where are we?
The island of Sodor, of course.
This way.
-Oh, bogus!
I think I'm allergic to grass.
It's a good thing
I like climbing things.
Grass.
What's that noise?
The trains. They talk.
We're just too far away to hear what they're saying.
Good morning.
Annie! Clarabel!
There's Mr. Conductor!
We found him!
Oh, bunko! It's Junior.
- Junior, look!
- It's Thomas!
Thomas, now, don't look so surprised. I know you haven't seen me since...
You stuffed party poppers down my funnel!
- We had a laugh.
- You did.
- You're talking to each other.
- Ah! First prize.
Lily, Thomas. Thomas, Lily.
Now, where's my cousin?
-Hi.
-Hello, Lily.
Welcome to Sodor.
Come on, Lily.
I'm very at home on trains.
Annie, Clarabel,
I'll send Percy back to fetch you.
We've heard that one before.
-Travel sickness.
What's that shining at the windmill?
Presto, Lily.
I think it's my cousin!
Mr. Conductor!
Mr. Conductor!
Thomas!
Thank throttles you're safe!
Come on, Lily.
Hey, Cous, what's up?
-No, Junior, I am not.
As a matter of fact,
I just landed here after escaping a heavy metal monster.
Junior, where have you been?
Is your sparkle back,
Mr. Conductor?
No, Thomas, it isn't.
But I do know the clue.
Stoke up the magic in the mountain...
Darn!
Dither!
Hey, Cous, you're looking terrible.
Why don't we get more gold dust
'cause I used yours up.
Then you can go back home and I can go to the beach.
Junior, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
Uh-oh.
- I'll get that.
- I've got it.
Hello?
No, this is his cousin.
Give the phone.
Who's this?
Oh, hello, Hattie.
No, no. He's hanging around here somewhere.
Yes, Sir Topham Hatt, sir.
No, he just wanted to be friendly.
No, he is not a dog.
Let's just say he's a puppy in need of a good trainer.
No, nothing to worry about, sir.
Goodbye, sir.
Cous, this is Lily.
She's staying with Grandpa Stone.
Hello, Lily.
Hello.
- Junior?
- Whoa!
- What are you doing up there?
- Come down.
It's too windy!
This is just like the fun fair!
Give us two seconds.
Whoo-hoo!
Two seconds is all it takes for you to land in trouble!
- Ah-ha! Twinkle Toes Junior!
- Oh, no, my beach bag!
You won't be doing any surfing up here, Mr. Kahuna.
Really? Watch me.
Hang on tight, Moon Doggie!
Yee-haw!
Diesel's hijacked him!
What's gonna happen to Junior now?
My family's pretty good at getting themselves out of trouble. Eventually.
I don't know what eventually means but it sounds very, very long.
-I wish I knew.
I'm sorry.
She wasn't at the station when I went back for her.
It's okay, Patch.
We'll find her. Don't worry.
I am brave.
I am brave.
Thomas says I'm brave, so I'm brave.
Oh! It's not easy being brave.
Shiver my pistons!
There's Splatter and Dodge!
Oh! They found the buffers.
Oh, now what's going to happen?
- Howdy partner.
- Excuse me.
Oh, that's just nothing.
Ah!
That nothing was something.
These must be the buffers
Diesel's looking for.
Are we supposed to go through them?
Not we, you.
Not me, you.
This is a job for the boss.
We'll tell him tomorrow.
Yeah, tomorrow's good.
Oh,
I'd better hurry back and warn Thomas.
I was doing my best to keep Lily cheerful.
I knew she was worried about being late for her grandpa,
Mr. Conductor,
I was supposed to be back by sunset.
You know, Lily, perhaps your grandpa can guess where you are.
-Maybe.
Because I think he's been here himself, long ago.
And if he can help,
I do wish he'd hurry.
I haven't told Junior this, but soon he'll grow as weak as I am.
Junior said there used to be an engine that traveled on the magic railroad.
And if only we could find that we could still head back to
Shining Time.
Oh, that engine disappeared.
Never to be seen or heard from again.
I have to tell you something, Mr. C.
I've heard a train whistle and it sounded like it came from the mountain.
Mountain. I just remembered another part of the clue.
"Stoke up the magic in the mountain and the lady will smile."
But we need more information, Lily.
And I know that your grandpa could help if he would just believe that he could.
Lady?
She can whistle.
I've heard her.
Yeah, so have I.
It's because she's magic.
This must be the map of her magic railroad.
But the railroad's energy is fading away.
I sensed it when we were out riding.
Lily and I were traveling on the ground above it.
The railroad needs Lady but I don't know her special secret.
And I need to know it now more than ever.
-Yes, because of Lily.
So, Thomas, we must get Lily back to her grandpa now incase Diesel gets rid of the railway.
But how can Lily go without gold dust?
Only in the lost engine.
-Unless...
Thomas, will you please take Lily?
Through the buffers?
But what if I go on the railway and my wheels don't work?
-But what if, if...
- It will be for a while.
- And cold.
- Maybe.
- And how will
I get back again?
Because you're a
Really Useful engine and will find a way.
Then I'll try.
I promise
I'll get you home to your grandpa, Lily.
Follow me, partner.
Right this way to Bufferville.
- Just a walk in the park.
We're going through, Lily.
You're on your own from here on in, little buckaroo!
Little engines can do big things.
It is dark and cold and bumpy but I'm not afraid.
Oh, there's the missing coal truck.
Coal truck?
"Stoke up the magic in the mountain."
That's part of
Mr. Conductor's clue to his gold dust.
And, Lily, that's what you do with coal, stoke it up to make steam.
We're going to be really reliable and help
Mr. Conductor.
We're going back for that coal truck.
Buffers. Coal truck.
We're starting to solve the mysteries, Lily.
You're a Really Useful engine,
Thomas.
- Lily, where are we?
- Muffle Mountain, Thomas.
I think I feel a little dizzy.
I can't go any further.
My wheels won't let me.
Then I'll be back, Thomas.
I promise.
But I must find Grandpa.
It's getting windy up here.
Bust my boiler!
I've left the coal truck behind!
Where's Grandpa?
Can you take me to him?
- Jump up.
- I knew I could count on you.
Stop, wheels. Stop!
Whoa!
Grandpa!
Oh, Lily.
I'm so glad to see you.
There's this island with talking trains and they said you might have been there.
But Mr. Conductor's very sick and Junior's in danger and I had to leave poor Thomas behind.
Please help me.
I'd like to, Lily.
Nothing seems to work.
This is the lost engine from long ago.
Now we can go back to the island and bring
Mr. Conductor and Junior home.
I can't make her steam.
I've tried all the different coals in the valley.
Lady.
-Yes.
Coal. Special coal from the island of Sodor.
That's what Lady needs.
Patch, there's a coal truck up at the top of the mountain.
- Do you think you could get some?
- Of course I will.
I'm sorry, Lily and Cous,
I haven't been responsible, reliable,
Really Useful...
But I will be!
But I will be!
James!
So you've lost your sparkle, too, huh?
Bye-bye, Twinkle Toes.
Oh! It's empty.
Here we go.
Junior, what are we gonna do?
We'll think of something.
That's it.
I'll find you some more, Lily.
I promise.
But if I'm going to be any help at all, it's now or never.
I've got to use up the rest of this stuff.
- Are you ready?
- No, we're not.
James the brains, get us out of here.
Now we are.
What the...
- Bye, James.
- Bye, Junior.
Sorry I've been so long, Cous.
But better late than never?
Junior, we are all out of gold dust, aren't we?
Bankrupt.
Hey!
It's a beautiful day!
I mean we're down, but we're not out.
No, we're out...
But we are not down.
Did Grandma love Lady as much as you do?
Did she take a ride on her?
Grandma loved her because I loved her.
But she never took a ride on Lady.
I couldn't fix her in time.
Lily, look.
The railroad's getting its energy back.
Well, my Lady, the lights are all green for you now.
Green for glory.
- Tasha would have loved this journey.
- Yes, she would.
And she'd love it that you're with me now.
So, Burnett, you didn't forget about magic.
It's safe inside you.
Thomas!
You've found her!
And she's beautiful!
We're on the island of Sodor.
Stop, Grandpa.
Stop, Lady.
Hello, Junior. Hello, Mr. C.
Mr. Conductor, this is my grandpa.
I'm glad you were able to find your way back.
Junior, do you realize who this is?
I reckon this is one beautiful engine.
Oh...
This is the lost engine.
Oh, are we glad to see you.
Now we can go back to Shining Time.
Junior.
We won't make it back to Shining Time without the gold dust.
Without it, the magic can't exist.
Ah-ha!
There's the blue puffball!
And look who he's with.
Splodge, come and destroy.
No.
You do it yourself.
We don't like you.
- We mean that.
- Emphatically.
- What does that mean?
- I have no idea.
Run, Lady. Quickly!
And I'm going to help you.
So am I, my Lady.
I'll not let you down again.
Who needs you, Splodge?
Watch out for the viaduct.
It's dangerous!
What's the matter?
Lady.
That engine's name is Lady.
- She's part of the clue to the source of...
...The gold dust!
Now I'll get you, Burnett Stone.
No, you won't, because the magic you refuse to believe in will get the better of you.
You can run, but you can't hide.
Right, Pinchy?
- Pinchy's hungry.
- Get back!
Come on, Lady.
Coming, Puffball.
Look out!
Here I come! Duck, Pinchy!
I like my lunch steamed.
Pretty fast for a puffball.
Well, Lady, this is your shining time, too.
I hope so.
Come on, Lady.
Little engines can do big things.
Well done, Thomas!
Well done!
Hey! Ooh! What's going on?
Oh! Hold it!
Puffball!
Teapot!
Tin kettle!
Oh, well.
Nice time of the year for a cruise.
But, Mr. Conductor, you still don't have your gold dust.
I think he will soon.
Wait a minute.
"Then watch the swirls that spin so well."
Swirls. Like the shavings around Lady when we were on the railroad.
- Is there anything else?
- Of course there is.
"So well."
A well means water.
Lily, put the shavings in with the water.
Go ahead, Lily.
Throw it up in the air.
Please! Please!
Now, Lily.
- Gold dust!
- Gold dust!
Yey!
Gold dust!
Lady, you're a really helpful engine.
And helping each other brings to life the magic in all of us.
Come on, Mutt.
Let's look around.
Lily...
I think I promised you something.
Here.
Take some.
So, Cous, how else can I help?
You mean, you don't want to go back to the beach?
No.
Well, maybe for a holiday.
But I'm ready to work.
You got a job for me?
You know, Junior, there is a railroad.
-One or two.
-Sunny spells.
I'll take it.
What's the way?
This is the way.
Hello.
Oh, yes, Sir Topham Hatt, sir.
You're on your way back right now.
Splendid news.
I'll be at the sheds to welcome you.
Oh, yes, sir.
Everything is under control.
Goodbye, sir.
Well, see you in Shining Time.
Here, Grandpa.
I'd like you to have this.
Well, how sweet of you, Lily.
Here. Give me the bluebird.
I think we should share it.
Now we'll always remember our Shining Time together.
Have a great time.
Ah!
And so we've come to the happy end of our story.
But it's time for all of us to go home, just like Thomas.

The Land Before Time III
The Time of the Great Giving
A long time ago, at least thirty-five hundred million years ago, the earliest form of life made it's first appearance on earth.
These single-celled creatures developed and grew, and changed a million times over.
Until at last, there was a creature able to leave the sea, and to crawl out into an unknown world.
From this long fish-like creature came hundreds of other animals.
The mightiest of which was called the Dinosaur.
For most of the earth's dinosaurs, life was filled with danger.
But for the fortunate leaf-eating dinosaurs of the Great Valley, life was peaceful, and food plentyful.
The Great Valley was the perfect place for children like Littlefoot, the longneck,
Cera, the threehorn,
Ducky, the swimmer,
Petrie, the flyer, and Spike, the spiketail, to grow and learn and play.
- I got it!
- No, me got it!
Go, Spike.
Did you did it, Spike?
Did you? Huh?
Yep, yep, yep. You got it.
I found an other one.
I found an other one.
Hy, Hyp. Do you hand my rock back, please?
Your rock? Who said it was your rock?
Yeah, who said it was your rock, huh?
Who said? Who said?
Oh. Ah. Yeah!
Well, Gee, no-one, but we were just playing with it.
So give it back, Hyp!
Well, I didn't hear you say:
Please.
That's, because I didn't.
Hey, maybe we can all play, together.
Good idea, Littlefoot.
We all play.
Yep, yep, yep, the more the better.
What do you thing guys?
Wanna play with these... babies?
Babies? Who's he calling babies?
- Us?
- Uh. Me no baby! Me big!
Yeah, big baby!
- Me no like them.
- Me neither.
I'll show 'em!
- Cera!
- I'm busy!
- Come, and get us!
- Yeah, try!
Whow. What's that?
- Its' a...
- Earthshake!
- Rocks flying?!
- Flying rocks!
- Daddy!
- Mama!
Grandma! Grandpa!
Fly children! Fly!
Run!
Littlefoot!
Look out!
- Littlefoot.
- I'm in here, Grandma.
Are you all right, little one?
Would you like to come out now?
Shee, that wasn't a regular kind earthshake, was it?
No, Littlefoot, it wasn't.
- Than what kind was it?
- We don't know, Littlefoot.
Perhaps it had to do with those great rocks, falling from the sky.
Oh, yeah. I saw 'em.
And I saw that big one, landing somewhere in the mysterious beyond.
I sure wish we could go find it.
Yes, that would be an adventure now, wouldn't it?
Well, I think we've had enough adventure for one day.
Come. It's time to settle down for the night.
It's beautiful, isn't it, Grandpa?
Oh, yes, Littlefoot.
Beautiful.
And mysterious.
As is so much in our world.
Well, at least that danger has passed.
- Huh, what? - Look, everyone!
Where did the water go?
- It stopped flowing.
- How can that be?
What will we do without water?
Grandpa? Why did the
Thundering Falls just stop?
I don't know, Littlefoot.
I don't know.
Littlefoot, go and play.
Grandpa and I must talk with the other grown-ups.
Sure, Grandma.
- See you later, Grandpa.
- This's never happened before.
Hey guys!
Guess, what happened to the Thundering Falls!
Sss! We are trying to find Cera.
She has hided from us.
- But...
- Me no find Cera anywhere.
- Guess, what, Petrie!
- What? You no find Cera either?
Cera is a very good hider.
She is.
I scared you!
I scared you! I did!
You no scared me, Cera.
Me unscareable!
Peatrie, you are rubbing my nose.
Oh, huhuh, sorry.
Me no know my own strength.
Now who is going to hide?
Littlefoot?
Okey, but first
I wanna tell you something.
Well, hurry it up!
We wanna play!
I saw a... hey!
Spike is taking your term for you, Littlefoot.
My brother is not a very good hider, oh no.
Now, just what were you gonna say, Littlefoot?
It's the Thundering Falls!
It's not giving us any water!
You gotta come see!
Why don't you hatchlings go run and see?
Yeah, run and see!
Run and see!
Oh! Aa... yeah!
- Try and make us!
- No, Cera, no!
Oh, don't worry!
I won't hurt them. Much.
Put those away!
How come all you ever want to do is fight, Hyp?
Yeah, fight.
Ouh. Fighting hurt.
Yeah. It does give you aue-s,
Hyp. Why do we do it?
Why? Why?
Because we are bigger!
And bigger's smarter!
Bigger is meaner, and bigger is better!
When you're big, you can push all the little ones around, they're looking up, while you are looking down.
You can snap a tree in two, like it's just a twig.
Things are better, when you're big.
When you're big, you can do anything you wanna do.
All the rules the grown-ups make, they don't apply to you.
Just smashing on the puddles, gop and slurp and swig the world is wider, when you're big.
You can snort, you can grunt.
You can stock, you can haul.
You can bug someone smaller on the head.
On the head.
You can take, what you want.
Lay all day in the swamp.
And you never ever have to go to bed.
When you're big, you can step on little peoples toes, lunch on their lunch, bump them in the nose.
Threehorns and longnecks, and duckfeet too.
They all have to do anything you want'em to.
And if they don't, you can plumb them in the gue.
Don't you forget, what you want you get.
Things are better, when you're big.
When you're big.
When you're big.
When you're big.
But Hyp, when you're a grown-up, you won't be very big at all.
Yeah! Your kind never gets very big.
When we grow up, we'll be much bigger.
Aha. Aha, much-much-much-much bigger!
Oh, yeah? Well I'm gonna see to it, that you never grow up.
- Oh, yeah!
- Never grow up, never.
How are we gonna do that, Hyp?
Shee, is he dumb.
Let me lay it out for you.
First we chase 'em, second we catch 'em, third we hurt 'em! See?
No Hyp. I don't see.
- Anybody. - Me neither.
- What?
Come on, haul 'em later.
As you can all see, our valley is quickly drying up.
Yes. We see it, and feel it as well.
There is less and less water to drink.
And green food to eat.
I know. That is why our herds must work together.
To save the little water we have left.
From now on, we must drink only what we need to survive.
And no more.
Hopefully soon the Thundering
Falls will bring us water again.
If not, we may have to leave the Great Valley.
- Leave the Great Valley?
- Never! - It's our home!
Than, until the water returns, we must not use the water we have left unwisely.
Threehorns never use water unwisely. But your herds do!
Our herds? What makes you think, our herds would do such a thing?
You drink greedily with no concern for others.
Can you believe he is saying that?
- Well, I've seen threehorns waste. - What?
You take long baths, even if you are the least bit dirty.
And, I've seen your kind waste, too.
Splashing water needlessly, for shame.
Impossible!
I never did such a thing!
Hey! Let's play bullies!
I'll be Hyp!
- I'm gonna get you!
- Not, if I get you first!
Me wanna play bullies too!
Hey, hatchling, you no eat my green-food!
Me go play bullies someplace else.
Petrie! You're a flyer, not a swimmer!
Me no bully either.
But I am!
- Not again!
- Oh, no-no-no-no-noooo!
It them!
That you hatchlings keep playing in our swimming hole, huh?
They're beginning to get on my nerves.
Can we teach'em a lesson, Hyp?
Huh? Can we, huh?
Be my guest, Nod!
Run!
- See ya!
- Wouldn't wanna be ya!
This is not funny!
Now someone splashed me, and wasted precious water.
Littlefoot, are you all right?
Aha. But I think I'm in trouble.
Your Littlefoot is guilty of wasting water.
What happened, Littlefoot?
It was an accident,
Grandpa! Honest!
I'm sure, it was, Littlefoot.
Our children don't understand the water problem, the Great Valley has always given them everything they need.
What are those grown-ups talking about?
What water problem? Isn't the
Thundering Falls coming back?
I don't know.
Well, it should!
Why wouldn't it?
Maybe it is tired and needs to rest.
We need to teach our children, how to use the remaining water wisely.
Speak for yourself, longneck!
My Cera would never waste!
Your Littlefoot is a bad influence!
That's not true!
- What is influmance?
- Me no know.
Come, Cera!
You're not to play with the little longneck any more.
But, Daddy!
My friend.
I think you're acting rushly.
Littlefoot is not to blame.
- I said, come Cera!
- No!
Cera, I'm your father.
And I know, what's best for you.
- Petrie, it's time to go home!
- Bye-bye! Coming, Mama!
Come Ducky, Spike, you too!
Do not worry, Littlefoot!
You're not an influmance, whatever that is.
I don't understand, Grandpa. Why does Cera's dad think I'm bad?
Oh, he is just confused,
Littlefoot.
Sometimes fear makes grown-ups do strange things.
I don't understand, Daddy!
You need friends, who know how to behave.
Especially in times like this.
Littlefoot is my friend!
He'll always be my friend!
- Cera, I'm your father!
I want, what's best for you!
No, you don't! You just don't want me to have any fun!
Cera, please. I'm just trying to... as a parent I...
Time to wake up, my little one.
Grandma! It's early.
I'm still sleepy.
You must get up, Littlefoot!
If you want to drink the morning dew with us.
The morning dew?
Yes. It collects on the leeves in the early morning.
If we hurry, we can drink the dew, before the bright circle gets too high in the sky and dries it all up.
All right.
Here, Littlefoot, drink this.
I think, you'll find it delicious.
Ups! It broke!
It's not your fault, Littlefoot.
The treestars are very dry now, and crumble easily.
But when will everything be green and wet again, Grandma?
I don't know.
I hope, soon.
But what's going to happen, if it's not soon?
Water will get harder and harder to find.
Soon, everything will be as dry as that treestar.
- And it will be easier for fires to start. - Fire?
Yes, Littlefoot. Which is why you must remember the escape paths, we've shown you.
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll remember.
I think, we're in luck.
There is still quite a few green treestars left here.
Come on, then! Let's eat!
Yeah, let's eat!
These don't look too good.
But I sure am hungry.
They taste terrible!
Here, Littlefoot. Try these!
They're still very green.
- Thanks, Grandpa!
- Go on, Littlefoot. Eat up!
But, but what about you?
Don't you want some?
Thank you, Littlefoot.
But Grandpa and I will be fine.
Yes. You're still growing, you need the very best green food, we can find.
Well, okey.
That was good!
But sure I am thirsty.
When is it our turn for water?
Our turn for water is when the bright circle touches the Smoking Mountain.
But if you're thirsty,
I think you can have a drink now.
After all, we never agreed that the children should have the same water restrictions as the elders.
Oh, boy! Water!
It's not your time to drink, longnecks!
What do you mean, not our time?
We agreed, that all herds must take terms drinking at the watering hole.
Yes, we all agreed, but I didn't think, that it included the children.
It really isn't fair to them.
There is no fair, when it comes to survival.
When life is tough, you got to be tougher, if you wanna stay alive!
When the trail gets rough, you got to get rougher, to help your family survive.
You can run around in circles, wondering what to do.
Someone's got to be the boys a reason, is it you, or you, or you?
When things around us are going bad, we all better be strong.
We could loose everything we've had, if this goes on too long.
Don't stand around here talking!
I say, that's not enough!
No tears, no sighs, don't close your eyes!
We got to stand tough!
I used to hear my father say:
Stand and fight, don't run away!
He made me, what I am today,
I'm here!
And I'm tough!
When times are hard, you better be harder, you don't know what's in store.
You think, you're smart?
You got to be smarter, than you ever were before.
You say, I'm mean, you say, if I bother, but I have a daughter and I'm her father.
I'm gonna make sure, we all have water enough.
That's why I'm tough!
I'm standing tough!
We got to stand tough!
You don't like it? Tough!
Littlefoot! Over here!
You judge us wrongly, threehorn.
I'm only doing, what needs to be done.
But this is going too far!
What are we gonna do about the grown-ups, Littlefoot?
- They're acting like babies!
- I know.
And it's all the
Thundering Falls's fault, too.
If we had more water, this wouldn't be happening.
- That's it, Cera!
- What's it?
Water!
If we find some, the grown-ups will stop being mad.
Maybe. Except for my Dad.
He is always mad.
Yeah. He is kind'a grumpy.
But I'm sure it's just because he is so worried about the water.
Yeah. Anyway, let's go get
Petrie, Ducky and Spike and find some water.
- How about a compromise?
- No. We must be firm.
Can't we agree on anything?
- Are we all here?
- Yep-yep-yep. Here. All here.
Oh, no. We are not.
Where is Spike?
Well, don't ask me!
He is not my brother.
Oh, Spike! Where are you, little brother?
What that?
It sound like monster.
Do not worry, Petrie!
That is not a monster!
That is Spike!
Spike?
That is his sleeping sound.
Come on, I'll show you.
See?
You are right, Ducky.
Get up, silly. This is not nap-time. This is get up-time.
You wake up now, okey Spike?
Huh! Spike up!
Spike down.
Spike, no!
- Are you okey, Petrie?
- Aha. Spike sure heavy sleeper.
We gotta wake him up, because it's gonna take all of us to find more water.
Water? Yes!
Me help find water!
Spike, stop!
Me no find water yet.
Don't worry, Spike!
We find it, I just know we will.
We'd better!
Because if our parents stay mad any longer,
I'm just gonna scream!
- Oh, I will scream too!
- Petrie good screamer!
What about you, Spike?
- How we find water, Littlefoot?
- We smell for it, silly.
Oh, yes! Smell for it, with our noses.
I know how to do that.
No smell so hard, okey, Spike?
- This is serious, Ducky.
- Oh, yes, Cera. I know. I know.
It's not your turn!
Go on!
My sniffer is very-very sniffed out.
Well, I'm so thirsty,
I could drink a lake.
Me too, if we could find one.
Funny. Me smell water, but me no see water.
- Did you hear a...a splash?
- Aha. - Water!
That is so good!
Oh, yes. This is the yummiest water ever. It is!
And we drink all we want, no-one yelling us.
There they are. And would you look, what they've found for us.
What is it?
Hi, ya, hatchlings.
Say bye-bye, water.
Why?
Is it going somewhere?
No, but you are!
- This is our water now!
- So give it back!
Give back?
But it already in my tummy.
But do you not want to share?
- We don't share with anybody.
Do we? - No, not. - Nobody.
So I'm warning you, small fries, if you tell anybody else about this water, you'll be very-very sorry!
We are telling. And you better not try to stop us!
Hurry!
Hurry! Can't let them tell!
What am I running for?
I'm not afraid of those.
Hey! What's the big idea?
No time to fight bully, Cera.
We go tell grown-ups about water.
Where'd they go, Hyp, huh?
Where'd they go?
If I knew,
I wouldn't be looking for 'em.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, dummy!
Aaaa!
Keep running!
Are they still after us?
Me no know.
Me too scared to look.
Spike, you're going the wrong way!
Hurray! Now you're on the right way!
Why are we going this way anyway, Littlefoot?
We're tired, and this way is hard!
Because this is the shortest way back to the grown-ups.
And it will be harder for the bullies to follow us.
It is the mysterious beyond!
And it have water!
Whole bunches!
The flying rocks must have caused slides in the mysterious beyond too.
Yeah! And those dumb slides blocked our barwater.
Come on! The grown-ups will know what to do.
Bad weather for flying.
Lookout!
Not this way!
I know an other path.
That's enough. You've had your share for today.
- The threehorn is getting far too bossy. - I agree.
- Grandpa! Grandma!
- Daddy!
Fire!
There's fire in the valley!
Are you sure,
Littlefoot?
Yes, Grandpa.
It's near to border pass.
Yes, we can see the fire signs from here.
The border pass?
- That's close to here.
- We must run.
Calm yourselves.
We will lead you to safety.
No, I will. We will be better off, following me.
This way!
Come!
But you're heading down-wind, where the fire will surely spread.
We must go up-wind of the fire.
Do as you will, longneck, but Cera and I go this way. Come, Cera.
But Daddy!
The others can do what they want, but you are my daughter, and you'll do as I say.
I'm... 'm...
I'm going with my father.
I do not feel good about this.
Oh, no. I do not.
Grandma! Grandpa!
Can't you stop them?
I have to go after 'em!
Yes. Littlefoot, you come with me.
We'll lead the others to safety.
But what about everybody else in the valley, Grandma?
What will happen to them?
They'll use the escape routes closest to them. Now come.
Everyone! Follow me!
Children first!
Cera!
Grandma!
What's wrong?
The smoke is too thick.
You'll have to lead.
But I...
Follow me, everyone!
- Where is he?
- I can't see!
Littlefoot! The grown-ups cannot see good. They cannot.
They can hear.
Follow my voice!
Stay close to the one in front of you!
Keep you heads down, it's not much further.
- Are you sure, this is right,
Daddy? - Of course I'm sure!
- Daddy!
- This way, Cera!
We're trapped!
Threehorns! Over here!
Hurry, Cera!
- Are you all right, Cera?
- Yes, Daddy.
Come!
Grandpa!
- They made it! I was so worried!
- I'm fine, dear, really.
How is everyone else?
Our group got here safely.
Thanks to Littlefoot.
Oh, yes.
Thanks to Littlefoot.
We are all very lucky.
Lucky? How can you say we are lucky, when our valley burns?
We are without water, and now we are without a home.
All is lost.
All is not lost, my friend.
You still have Cera.
And you are still here.
Able to care for her.
Well, you are right.
Thank you longneck.
But the threehorn speaks the truth.
We don't.
We'll never be able to go back to the Great Valley.
Never go back to the
Great Valley? Oh, no!
The water! We forgot to tell them about the water!
Grandma! Grandpa!
We found water!
- Water?
- Where, Littlefoot?
- It's stuck!
- Behind the Thundering Falls.
- The flying rocks did it.
- They did.
Which means, the water is trapped in the mysterious beyond.
The mysterious beyond.
- We can't go there!
- It's dangerous!
Of course it's dangerous!
But no place is safe now.
We must go and free the water!
But such a huge gathering place of water will attract other creatures besides ourselves.
In the mysterious beyond, there'll be sharp-teeth.
Sharp-teeth?!
I do not like sharp-teeth.
Oh, no!
Their teeth are too sharp.
Still, we must do something!
We must come up with a plan to free the water!
I have a plan!
I hope it's better than your fire-escape plan.
Please!
This is no time to argue.
At least I had a plan!
Stop!
You're acting like children!
We no act like that!
- I have a plan, too.
- Mine's better.
I sure would like to get to that water first, before the rest of those dummies go slubbering in it.
But you heard the grown-ups, Hyp.
- What about sharp-teeth?
- What about them?
You tell'm, Mutt!
Well, they're bad. Yeah!
And scary too.
Come on! You are just as afraid as we are!
Me?
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Bet, you are!
- Bet, I'm not!
You were afraid of those big flying rocks!
I was not! I just ran, because you guys did.
I... I dind't want you to feel stupid.
Well, than prove it!
All right, I will! I'll get me some tasty water, and you babies can stay here!
- I'm not a baby!
- Me neither!
- Hyp! Wait!
- Ah, yeah. For us!
- We must act now!
- We must not act rushly.
They are so dumb!
Didn't they hear what the grown-ups said about sharp-teeth?
I guess not.
Well if they get eaten, it'll just serve them right.
- Cera! That is not nice!
- I don't care! They deserve it!
I don't know, you guys, maybe we should do something.
Like what?
Like... tell their parents where they went?
All of our parents 're too busy arguing.
Your plan is too dangerous.
- Yours is no better!
- Then listen to mine!
Yours? Don't be silly!
Then... maybe we should go stop them!
- Stop them?
- Us?
They hate us.
They will not listen.
- I know, they're bigger.
- But definitely not smarter!
- Still we have to try!
- But why?
They have feelings, just like we do.
They have problems too.
We think, because they're big, they don't. But they do.
They're louder and they're stronger, and they make a bigger foss.
But way down deep inside,
I think,
They're kids like us.
They have parents just like ours who tell them what to do.
They have feet and tails and horns and skins and noses too.
And when the earth is shaking, they run and hide, because even if the think they're tough, they're still kids like us.
It's just too dangerous,
Littlefoot.
Yes, it is.
- And the're too mean.
- Very, very mean!
Maybe when you're bigger, you think you should pretend, you're not afraid of scary things, that you don't need a friend.
But they're just kids in trouble.
They need some-one to trust.
If we can't bring them home, show them they're not alone.
That they're just kids.
Kids like us.
I just have to try and stop'em.
You guys do what you want.
Last one to go is a scary egg!
Me no scary egg!
Wait for us!
We're not scary eggs either!
Are you sure, this is the right way to the water, Hyp?
Sure I'm sure!
I'm just taking us this special way.
So we don't run into any stupid sharp-teeth.
Wait for me!
Come on, guys! Wait!
Stop whining, Mutt!
This is easy!
Well, what do you know?
A little watering hole.
Just for me!
You guys can have some.
If I leave any.
Huh-uh! Water!
I'm sinking! I'm sinking!
Don't you stand there, pull me out!
- Oh, yeah!
- Right. What do we do?
I don't know.
What do you think we should do?
Somebody do something!
Help! Help!
That's Hyp!
Get me out!
Get me out!
- You pull him out!
- What if I get stuck?
- Then I'll pull you out, okey?
- What if you get stuck..
He's stuck in a tarpit.
Stop moving Hyp! It will only make you sink faster.
We'll have to pull him out.
Everybody line up!
Okey. When me say pull.
- Hey! You're squitching me!
- I'm sorry.
Petrie! Pull!
Are you, are you okey, Hyp?
Are you?
Of course I'm okey.
I was never not okey.
He big fat fibber.
Yeah! We helped you and you know it!
I don't need anybody's help!
Not now, not ever!
But everyone needs help some time! They do.
Help!
There they are!
Littlefoot.
This is no time to go exploring.
Didn't you realise you wandered into the mysterious beyond?
We weren't exploring, Grandpa!
We were trying to stop the bullies...
I... I mean
Hyp and his friends, or they might've got hurt.
Hyp. Here we are chasing after you, when we should be finding a way to free the water.
I thought I told you to stay where it was safe!
Don't look at me that way!
I'm your father and
I know what's best for you.
Yelling is no way to teach your child what is right, or to show that you care.
- How would you know?
- I know, because... because I have a daughter, and I yell at her too much.
Especially when
I'm worried for her safety.
You don't have to worry about me,
Daddy.
If you always react with anger, that's all, your son will know.
And that's all, he'll be able to express to others.
What?
I know now, that we can't live together that way.
With such anger between us.
Our kids found water, because they worked together.
Now we must work together, too.
At last, we all agree.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Except I think we're in trouble.
Yeah.
So what else is new?
That!
And that!
Children! Stay behind me!
- And me!
- Gonna stay too.
Littlefoot! You and your friends, run to safety!
Trough here, kids!
Follow me!
- Grandpa!
- Don't look back! Come on!
We can't let them pass!
They've gone after the children!
Stay close!
We're going to get home!
Stop, where you are, sharp-teeth!
- They're leaving!
- Yes, but why?
Something bad is happening up there.
Stop, you babies!
Me first!
Look!
- Oh, no! Daddy!
- Grandpa!
You kids get to the top of that dam, where it's safer.
But what about the grown-ups?
Just get out of here!
I'll handle this!
Come on!
Why's your dad risking his neck.
- Yeah, what a dumb!
- He is not!
Dad!
- Na-na! Can't get me!
- Son?
The grown-ups are all right!
I'm out of here!
That serve sharp-tooth right.
- He bigger bully than you.
- Hey, watch it!
Come on!
Let's get on'em more rocks!
Are you nuts?
By the time you punch that, those sharp-teeth would be picking the teeth with our toes.
We got to try.
Move over, hatchlings.
This isn't gonna work.
Hyp!
Forget him, Littlefoot!
He is a creep.
Who are you calling, mate?
Get in there and help, you creeps.
Okey, everybody!
Let's get them!
We did it!
Leave our children alone!
We've got to stop the fighting!
Then let's squash those sharp-teeth once and for all.
Look! Water!
We've unlocked the water!
Run!
Looks like you and your friends saved the day, Littlefoot.
I think, we all did,
Grandpa.
Spike likes you now.
He does.
And so, with the return of the water, the Great Valley dinosaurs were able to go home again.
But the home they returned to, wasn't the same.
Fire had destroyed much of their green food.
But instead of giving into despair, the dinosaurs divided into groups, to find the spots, where green food still grew.
Hey, everybody!
We found more!
Did you hear that?
More green food!
How wonderful!
Where?
I mean...Where, son?
Over the canyon.
Not far from here, Pap.
If we share, this should be enough for everyone.
Are you feeling okey, Hyp?
You're talking about sharing.
Oh, yeah, sharing.
I know that.
Not sharing is for scary eggs.
Right?
Right!
Sharing is good.
Yep-yep-yep!
Come on.
Everybody follow us!
And so, as it turned out, the dinosaurs travelled from green spot to green spot.
Eating their fill,
Each helping the others to find what they needed.
Each learning the special kind of joy, which comes from giving to others.
And in the years to come, this story of sharing was told over and over again.
Until it became known, as
The Time of the Great Giving sub by Leonóra Németh
Directed by
Roy Allen Smith
[Birds chattering and hooting]
[Narrator] Many strange legends
are told of these jungles of India,
but none so strange as the story
of a small boy named Mowgli.
It all began when the silence
of the jungle was broken
by an unfamiliar sound.
[Baby crying]
It was a sound like
one never heard before
in this part of the jungle.
[Crying continues]
It was a man cub!
Had I known how deeply
I was to be involved,
I would've obeyed
my first impulse and walked away.
[Baby laughing, cooing]
[Cooing and laughing]
This man cub would have
to have nourishment, and soon.
It was many days' travel
to the nearest man-village,
and without a mother's care,
he would soon perish.
- [Cooing continues]
- Then it occurred to me.
A family of wolves I knew
had been blessed
with a litter of cubs.
[Whining, whimpering]
[Barking]
[Loud crying]
[Cooing, laughing]
I knew there'd be no problem
with the mother,
thanks to the maternal instinct,
but I wasn't so sure
about Rama, the father.
[Sniffs]
[Crying]
[Cooing, laughing]
[Laughing continues]
Ten times, the rains
had come and gone,
and I often stopped by to see how
Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.
He was a favourite with all
the young wolf cubs of the pack.
[Imitates howling]
[Howling]
- [Grunts]
- [Panting]
[Laughing]
[Whimpering]
No man cub was ever happier.
And yet, I knew that someday
he would have to go back
to his own kind.
[Wolf howling]
Then one night, the wolf pack
elders met at Council Rock
because Shere Khan, the tiger,
had returned
to their part of the jungle.
This meeting was to change
the man cub's entire future.
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him.
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done?
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father.
Rama.
Uh, come over here, please.
Yes, Akela?
The council has reached its decision.
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack.
He must leave at once.
"Leave"?
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.
But... But the man cub is...
Well, he's like my own son.
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack.
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger.
[Rama] But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle.
Akela, perhaps
I can be of help.
You, Bagheera? How?
I know of a man-village where he'll be safe.
Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together.
I'm sure he'll go with me.
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.
Good luck.
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.
Shouldn't we start back home?
Mowgli, this time we're not going back.
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?
Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle...
...and he has sworn to kill you.
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?
He hates man.
Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man, just another hunter with a gun.
Aw, we'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that.
Nonsense. No one explains anything to Shere Khan.
Well, maybe so, but I'm not afraid.
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.
We'll spend the night here.
Things will look better in the morning.
Man Cub?
Man Cub!
Now, come on. Up this tree.
It's safer up there.
Uh... I don't wanna go back to the man-village.
Go on. Up you go.
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.
[Laughing] Is that all the better you can climb?
[Grunting] It's too big around.
And besides, I don't have any claws.
[Grunting]
- Yeow-ohhh!
- [Snarling]
[Groaning]
Now get some sleep.
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow.
I wanna stay in the jungle.
Huh? [chuckles]
You wouldn't last one day.
[Yawns]
I'm not afraid.
I... I can look out for myself.
[Smacking lips]
S-S-S-Say, now.
What have we here?
[Giggles] It's a man cub.
A delic-i-ous man cub.
Oh, go away and leave me alone.
[Yawns] Oh, that's just what
I should do, but I'm not.
Oh, now, please go to sleep, Man Cub.
Yes-s-s-s, Man Cub.
# Pleas-s-se go to sleep
# Please go to sleep
# S-S-Sleep, little man cub
# Rest in peace #
Sleep.
- S-S-S-Sleep.
- [Moaning]
Ba-Ba-Bagheera...
[gulps]
Oh, now... now, look, there's no use arguing anymore.
Now, no more talk till morning.
[Chuckles] He won't be here in the morning.
Huh? Oh, yes, he will. I...
Kaa! Hold it, Kaa!
[Grunts]
Ohhh!
My sinus-s-s-s-s.
You have just made a s-s-s-serious mistake, my friend, a very s-s-s-stupid...
[stammers] Now, Kaa, I was...
[Kaa]... mistake.
Look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you.
No, please, Kaa...
Both eyes, if you please.
You have just s-s-s-sealed your doom.
Ohhh... Aaah!
Aaah! Ooh.
Look, Bagheera.
Look. Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.
[Groaning] Wha...?
Just you wait till I get you in my coils.
Uhhh!
[Mowgli laughing] Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!
"He's got a knot in his tail."
[Grunting]
[Moaning] This is going to slow down my s-s-s-slithering.
[Laughing]
- [Laughing stops]
- [Nervous chuckle]
So, you can look out for yourself, can you?
So, you want to stay in the jungle, do you?
Yes, I wanna stay in the jungle.
Ohhh! Now, now, for the last time, go to sleep.
[Muttering] Man cub. Huh!
Man cub. Ahhh.
[Yawns]
[Snoring]
[Rumbling]
# Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up
Two, three, four
- # Hup, two, three, four
- [snoring]
# Keep it up two, three, four
- [yawns]
- # Hup, two, three, four
A parade!
Oh, no.
The dawn patrol again. [sighs]
Company... sound off!
# Oh, the aim of our patrol
# Is a question rather droll
# For to march and drill
over field and hill
[trumpeting]
# Is a military goal
# Is a military goal
# Hup, two, three, four
# Dress it up, two, three, four
# By the ranks or single file
# Over every jungle mile
# Oh, we stamp and crush
through the underbrush
[squeaky trumpeting]
# In the military style
[all] # In the military style
Hello. What are you doing?
Shh! Drilling.
- Can I do it too?
- Sure. Just do what I do.
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.
[Leader] To the rear... march!
The other way. Turn around.
[Leader] # Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up, two, three, four #
To the rear...
...ho!
Company... halt!
That means "stop."
Company... left face!
March, march, march.
My feet are killing me.
I'm puttin' in for a transfer to another herd.
Silence in the ranks!
- Dress up that line.
- Oooh!
[Clearing throat]
Uh, pull it in, Winifred.
Inspection...
...arms!
[Whispering] Stick your nose out.
- [Whispering] Like this?
- That's right.
[Clicking tongue] A dusty muzzle.
Soldier, remember: In battle, that trunk can save your life.
Take good care of it, my man.
- Yes, sir.
- Very good. Carry on.
- [Clears throat]
- [Munching]
Let's have a little more spit and polish on those bayonets.
Yes, sir.
Esprit de corps.
That's the way I earned my commission in the Maharajah's
Fifth Pachyderm Brigade.
Back in '88, it was...
Or... Or was it?
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.
It was then I received the Victoria Cross, for bravery above and beyond the call of duty.
Ha ha!
Those were the days.
Discipline! Discipline was the thing.
Builds character and that sort of thing, you know.
Eh... Uh... Oh.
Uh, where was I?
Oh, yes. Inspection. [clears throat]
Well, very good.
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.
[Fly buzzing]
[Clears throat] Eyes front.
[Clicks tongue] Lieutenant, that haircut is not regulation.
Rather on the gaudy side, don't you think?
There. That's better.
And as for you...
Oh, there you are.
[Chuckles]
Let's keep those heels together, shall we, son?
OK, Pop.
- Sir.
- Yes, now that's better.
Well, a new recruit, eh?
[Laughs]
- I say, what happened to your trunk?
- Hey!
- Stop that!
- [Gasps, sputtering]
A man cub! Ohh, this is treason!
Sabotage!
I'll have no man cub in my jungle!
- It's not your jungle!
- Hold it! Hold it!
I can explain, Hathi.
Colonel Hathi, if you please, sir.
Oh, yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.
Good.
And remember, an elephant never forgets.
[Muttering] I don't know what the army's coming to these days.
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are?
[Clears throat] Let's get on with it!
Right face!
Forward... march!
Dear, haven't you forgotten something?
Nonsense, Winifred, old girl.
An elephant never forgets.
Well, you just forgot our son.
Uh, our s... Son? Son!
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Quite right.
To the rear... march!
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a colonel just like my...
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...
- Pop! Look out!
- [Groaning]
- [Thudding]
- [Groaning]
Ohhh! Oww!
Ohhh! Owww! Oooh!
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say "halt."
[Giggling]
He said an elephant never forgets.
- [Laughing stops]
- It's not funny.
Let's get out of here quick before anything else happens.
Bagheera! Where are we goin'?
You're going back to the man-village right now.
I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm staying right here.
You're going, if I have to drag you every step of the way.
[Grunting] Let go, you...
You let go of me! [grunting]
[Splash]
[Sputtering]
Ohh!
Oh, that does it.
I've had it, Man Cub.
From now on, you're on your own...
...alone!
Don't worry about me.
[Sighs] Foolish man cub.
[Rustling]
[Munching, slurps]
# Doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee-dee-doo
# Well, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
# Yes, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
# I mean, a-doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee, doo-bee
# Doo-bee-dee-doo
# And with... #
Well, now. Ha ha.
What have we here?
[Sniffs]
Hmm. Hey!
What a funny little bit of a...
- Ooh!
- Go away!
Oh, boy, I've seen everything in these woods.
Ooh, what have I run on?
- What a pretty thing this is.
- Leave me alone.
Well, now, that's pretty big talk, little britches.
I'm big enough.
- [Chuckles]
- [Grunting]
[Clicks tongue] Pitiful.
Hey, kid, you need help and ol' Baloo's gonna learn you to fight like a bear.
Come on. I'm gonna show ya.
[Growls]
Ha ha! Yeah!
All right, now, kid, loosen up.
Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now, move.
That's it. Now give me a big bear growl.
- Scare me.
- [Tiny growl]
[Clicks tongue]
Oh, boy.
I'm talkin' about like a big bear.
[Loud roar]
[Roaring continues]
He's in trouble.
I shouldn't have left him alone.
[Growls]
- [Loud roar]
- [Roaring]
- A big one, right from your toes.
- How's that?
[Mowgli continues roaring]
[Baloo laughs] You're gettin' it, kid.
Oh, no! It's Baloo!
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.
Weave about now.
Look for an opening.
Keep movin'. Keep... [laughs]
You're gettin' it, kid.
Come on! That's it! [laughing]
He's a dandy!
[Chuckles] Fine teacher you are,
Ol' Iron Paws.
Oh! Thanks, Bagheera.
Tell me, tell me, after you knock your pupil senseless, how do you expect him to remember the lesson, hmm?
Well, I... I, uh...
Well, I didn't mean to lay it on him so hard.
I'm not hurt. I'm all right.
I'm a lot tougher than some people think.
You better believe it.
Now, let's go once more.
I want you to keep circlin', or
I'm gonna knock your roof in again.
You'd better keep movin'... Ooh!
Hey! Right on the button.
[Groans]
[Laughs] No. No, no.
No, no. Now you're ticklin'.
[Laughs] No. No, no.
No, no. Now you're ticklin'.
[Laughing]
No. No, n-now, we don't do that here in the jun... No!
No, you're ticklin'.
I can't stand that ticklin'.
[Laughing] Help! Bagheera!
Oh, boy. That's all he needs, more confidence.
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya!
Ha ha! Oooh! I give...
Hey! Ha ha!
You know somethin'?
You're all right, kid.
What do they call you?
Mowgli, and he's going back to the man-village right now.
Man-village? They'll ruin 'im!
They'll make a man out of him.
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.
Certainly, you do.
Oh? And just how do you think he will survive?
"How do you think..."
What do you mean, how do you think he...
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.
Oh? That shouldn't take too long.
Look, now, it's like this, little britches.
All you gotta do is...
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# Are Mother Nature's recipes
# That bring
the bare necessities of life
- # Wherever I wander
- Ooof!
# Wherever I roam
# I couldn't be fonder
# Of my big home
# The bees are buzzin' in the tree
# To make some honey just for me
# When you look under
the rocks and plants
# And take a glance
at the fancy ants
# Then maybe try a few
You eat ants?
Ha ha! You better believe it.
And you're gonna love the way they tickle.
- [Gasps] Mowgli, look out!
- [Thud]
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
But when?
# They'll come to you
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear can rest at ease
# With just the bare necessities of life
# Now, when you pick a pawpaw
- # Or a prickly pear
- Oww!
# And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time beware
# Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw
# When you pick a pear
try to use the claw
# But you don't need
to use the claw
# When you pick a pear
of the big pawpaw
# Have I given you a clue?
Golly, thanks, Baloo.
"Pawpaw." Ha!
Of all the silly gibberish.
Come on, Baggy, get with the beat.
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
- They'll come to me!
- # They'll come to you
How 'bout scratchin' that left shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?
No. Just a hair lower.
There. Right there. That's it. Ohh!
This is beautiful. Oooh, that's good.
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratchin'.
[Laughing] You're lots of fun, Baloo.
[Moaning] Right on it.
Yeah!
That's delicious.
Ohhh! Oooh!
Just a little bit... Mmm.
Yeah! Ha ha!
Oooh!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Ha ha! Oooh!
Yeah!
Oh, man. This is really livin'.
So just try and relax. Yeah.
Cool it.
Fall apart in my backyard.
'Cause let me tell you somethin', little britches...
- [buzzing]
- If you act like that bee...
Uh-uh. You're workin' too hard.
And don't spend your time...
...lookin' around...
...for something you want...
...that can't be found.
# When you find out
you can live without it
# And go along not thinkin' about it
# I'll tell you somethin' true
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
[sighs] I give up.
Well, I hope his luck holds out.
Mowgli, how about you singin'?
[Together]
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
- Yeah, man!
- # I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear
can rest at ease
# With just the bare necessities of life
Yeah!
# With just the bare necessities of life
- # Yeah, man #
- Ha ha ha!
Beautiful. That's real jungle harmony.
I like being a bear.
That's my boy.
You're gonna make one swell bear.
Why, you even sing like one.
Yeah.
[Yawns]
# Doo-bee-doo
# Doo-bee-doo
# Aye-bee doogie-woogie doo
[fly buzzing]
Hey, Mowgli, how about you flickin' that ol' mean fly off of your papa bear's nose?
Ouch!
[Chuckles] Boy, when you flick a fly, you really...
Why, you flat-nosed, little-eyed, flaky creep!
Hey! Let go of me!
[Monkeys laughing]
Take your flea-pickin' hands off of my cub!
Come on and get 'im, champ!
- He ain't no champ! He's a chump!
- Baloo!
Yeah! Ha ha! A big hothead!
OK, you guys asked for it. I'll...
- Oooh!
- That'll cool 'im off! [laughing]
Gimme back my man cub!
Here he is! Come and get 'im!
[Monkeys chattering, hooting]
That's how a bear can rest at ease!
Here's some bare necessities!
Now, just try that again, you...
- What's that you hit him with, son?
- That was a bare necessity!
You turn him loose, or I'll jerk a knot in your tail!
We give up!
- Here he comes!
- Whoa-ohh-ohh!
- Baloo! Catch me!
- [Monkeys laughing]
- Baloo!
- Back up! Back up! Faster! Faster!
Faster!
- [Giggling]
- A rolling bear gathers no hair!
Baloo, help me!
Baloo! They're carrying me away!
Bagheera!
[Echoing] Bagheera!
Well, it's happened.
Took a little longer than I thought, but it's happened.
[Grunting]
- Bagheera!
- [Snarls]
[Echoing] Bagheera!
Oh, you heard me, huh?
Mowgli. Mowgli!
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?
They ambushed me.
Thousands of 'em.
I jabbed with my left, then I swung with a right...
Oh, for the last time, what happened to Mowgli?
Like I told ya, them mangy monkeys carried him off!
The ancient ruins.
Ohh, I hate to think what will happen when he meets that king of theirs.

"Stay in the jungle"? I sure do.
Good. And ol' King Louie...
# Bah-be-do-bay
Bu-bu-doo
That's me.

Have two bananas.
Have we got a deal?
Yes, sir, I'll do... [gulps]

[# Singing in gibberish]
[Applause, cheering]
[Giggling]
Gee, Cousin Louie, you're doin' real good.
Now here's your part of the deal, cuz.
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire.
But I don't know how to make fire.
# Now, don't try to kid me, Man Cub
# I made a deal with you
# What I desire is man's red fire
# To make my dream come true
# Now give me the secret, Man Cub
# Come on
Clue me what to do
# Give me the power
of man's red flower
- # So I can be like you

Fire? So that's what that scoundrel's after.
I'll tear 'im limb from limb.
I'll beat 'im. I'll... I'll...
Mmm. Yeah!
Well, man, what a beat.
Will you stop that silly beat business and listen?
This will take brains, not brawn.
You better believe it, and I'm loaded with both.
- Will you listen?
- Oh! Yeah, yeah.
Now, while you create a disturbance,
I'll rescue Mowgli.
- Got that?
- I'm gone, man.
- Solid gone!
- Not yet, Baloo!

How'd that square get in there?
Baloo! It's you!
[Roars]
[Laughing hysterically]
[Hooting, chattering]
[Shrieks]
Whew!
[Laughs]
Man, that's what I call a swingin' party!
And furthermore, Baloo,
Mowgli seems to have man's ability to get into trouble, and your influence hasn't been exactly...
Shh! Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.
- [Bagheera groans]
- Well, he's had a big day.
It was a real sockeroo.
You know, it ain't easy learnin' to be like me.
Hah! A disgraceful performance.
Associating with those undesirable, scatterbrained apes?
[Scoffs] I hope Mowgli learned something from that experience.
[Sighs]
# Scooby-dooby-dooby
Dooby-doo #
Ha ha!
That's my boy.
Oh, nonsense.
[Bagheera] Baloo.
Over here. I'd like to have a word with you.
"A word"?
You gonna talk some more?
[Yawns]
All right, what's up, Bagheera?
Baloo, the man cub must go back to the man-village.
The jungle is not the place for him.
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.
Yes, just look at yourself.
Look at that eye.
Yeah.
It's beautiful, ain't it?
Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.
Well, you don't look exactly like a basket of fruit yourself.
Ohhh! [clears throat]
Uh, Baloo, you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.
Why not?
How can I put it?
Baloo, birds of a feather should flock together.
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you?
I don't know.
[Laughs] Come to think of it, no panther ever asked me.
Oh, Baloo, you've got to be serious about this.
Oh, stop worryin', Baggy.
Stop worryin'.
I'll take care of him.
Yes, like you did when the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.
And another thing, sooner or later
Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.
The tiger? What's he got against the kid?
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.
Because he fears man's gun and man's fire.
But little Mowgli don't have those things.
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.
He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless.
Just one swipe and...
Ohh!
Well... Well, what are we gonna do?
We'll do what's best for the boy.
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.
Good. Then make Mowgli go to the man-village.
Are you out of your mind?
I promised him he could stay here in the jungle with me.
That's just the point.
As long as he remains with you, he's in danger.
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?
[Stammers] Because he won't listen to me.
I love that kid. [sniffles]
I love him like he was my own cub.
Then think of what's best for Mowgli and not yourself.
Uh, well, can't...
Can't I wait until morning?
It's morning now.
Go on, Baloo.
[Sighs]
Uh...
[sighs]
[Gasps]
Oh, boy.
Mowgli. Mowgli.
Uh, it's time to get up.
[Yawns] Oh. Hi, Baloo.
Hi.
Hey, rub that ol' sleep outta your eyes.
You and me, we got a long walk ahead of us.
Swell. Gee, we'll have lots of fun together.
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, all right, let's hit the trail, kid.
See ya around, uh, Bagheera.
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.
Me and Baloo, we've got things to do.
Goodbye, Man Cub...
...and good luck.
Come on, Baloo.
All we gotta do is...
# Look for the bare necessities
# Some good ol' bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear
can rest at ease
# With just the bare
necessities of life
Yeah!
# I'll live here in the jungle
all my life #
Yeah, man! I like being a bear.
Where we goin', Baloo?
Well, uh, it's, uh... Um...
Well, it's sorta new and, uh...
Oh, I don't care, as long as I'm with you.
Mowgli, uh, look, buddy, uh, there's somethin' I gotta tell ya.
Tell me what, Baloo?
Oh, gee whiz.
Now, how did ol' Baggy put it?
It's, uh...
Uh, uh, Mowgli... [chuckles]
You wouldn't marry a panther, would ya?
[Laughing] Gee, I don't even know what you're talking about.
[Growls]
Mowgli, don't you realize that you're a human?
I'm not anymore, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo!
- Mowgli, stop it now. Hold still.
- [Growling]
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin' all morning to tell ya,
I've got to take you back to the man-village.
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!
That's goin' too far!
Hey, Mowgli! Where you goin'?
Wait a minute! Stop!
Wait!
Wait! Listen to ol' Baloo!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli. Mowgli!
Now what's happened?
Well, y-you're not gonna believe me, Bagheera, but look, now, I used the same words you did, and he ran out on me!
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's separate. We've got to find him!
Oh, if anything happens to that little guy, I'll never forgive myself.
I gotta find him.
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
[Elephants trumpet]
# Hup, two, three, four
# Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up, two, three, four
What beastly luck.
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi.
Company... sound off!
# Oh, we march from here to there
# And it doesn't matter where
# You can hear us push
through the deepest bush
# Hup, two, three, four
[Hathi] # With a military air
[all] # With a military air
[trumpeting]
The jungle patrol!
# We're a crackerjack brigade
# On a pachyderm parade
# But we'd rather stroll
to a water hole
# Hup, two, three, four
[all] # For a furlough in the shade #
Stop!
Wait a minute. Halt!
- Ohh! Ohh!
- [Thudding]
Who said "halt"?
I give the commands around here.
Well, speak up. Who was it?
Oh, it was me, Colonel.
What do you mean, sir, taking over my command? Highly irregular, you know.
Oh, Colonel, I'm sorry, but I need your help.
[Hathi] Oh, absolutely impossible.
We're on a cross-country march.
[Bagheera] But it's an emergency,
Colonel.
- The man cub must be found.
- [Hathi] Man cub? What man cub?
How interesting.
The one I was taking to the man-village.
Good. That's where he belongs.
Now, sir, if you don't mind, we'd like to get on with the march.
[Bagheera] No, no, you don't understand, Hathi.
He is lost. He ran away.
How delightful.
Well, it serves the young whippersnapper right.
But... But Shere Khan, the tiger, is sure to pick up the man cub's trail.
[Chuckles]
Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.
Shere Khan isn't within miles of here.
[Chuckling]
Oh, sorry, Bagheera. Fortunes of war and all that sort of thing, you know.
This has gone far enough.
Far enough!
Now, just a minute, you pompous old windbag!
Winifred! What are you doing out of ranks?
Never mind.
How would you like to have our boy lost and alone in the jungle?
[Hathi] Our son... alone?
But, Winifred, old girl, that's an entirely different matter.
- [Scoffs]
- Different, entirely.
That little boy is no different than our own son.
Now you help find him or I'm taking over command.
What? A female leading my herd?
Utterly preposterous.
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.
He'll get hurt if we don't find him.
Please, Pop, sir? Please?
Now, don't you worry, son.
Your father had a plan in mind all the time.
[Scoffs] Sure you did.
[Sputtering] Troopers!
Company... left face!
Volunteers for a special mission will step one pace forward.
Ha ha! That's what I like to see.
Devotion to duty.
Now, you volunteers will find the lost man cub.
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.
Yes. Yes.
Uh, Bugler, when the man cub is sighted, you will sound your trumpet three times.
Yes, sir.
- [Trumpeting]
- [Hathi] Shh!
Not now, soldier.
[Nasal] Sorry, sir.
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be the element of surprise.
[Whispering] You will take one squad and cover the right flank.
[Lieutenant] Yes, sir.
[Whispering] And I shall meet the other squad on the left flank.
Very well.
[Shouting] Company...
[shout echoing]
...forward... march!
Element of surprise?
Oh, I say.
[Chuckling]
And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man cub.
Kaa! It's you!
Yes-s-s, Man Cub.
So nice to see you again.
[Giggling, hissing]
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.
Let me look at you.
You don't want me to look at you?
Then you look at me.
No, sir. I know what you're trying to do, Kaa.
You do?
Uh, I mean, you don't trust me.
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.
You want to help me?
[Hisses] Certainly.
I can see to it...
...that you never have to leave this jungle.
How could you do that?
Hmm?
Oh, I have my own...
...s- s-subtle little ways. [chuckles]
But first, you must trust me.
I don't trust anyone anymore.
I don't blame you.
I'm not like those so-called fair-weather friends of yours.
You can believe in me.
# Trust in me
# Just in me
# Shut your eyes
# And trust in me
Hold still, please.
# You can sleep
# Safe and sound
# Knowing I
# Am around
# Slip into silent slumber
# Sail on a silver mist
# Slowly and surely
# Your senses will cease to resist
[snoring]
You're snoring.
Sorry.
# Trust in me
# And just in me
# Shut your eyes
# And trust in me #
- [doorbell rings]
- Huh?
Oh, now what?
I'll be right down.
Yes? Yes? Who is it?
It's me, Shere Khan.
Uh, I'd like a word with you, if you don't mind.
Shere Khan.
What a s-s-surprise.
Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.
Oh, no, no. Nothing at all.
I thought perhaps you were entertaining someone up there in your coils.
Coils? Someone? Oh, no.
I was just curling up for my siesta.
But you were singing to someone.
- Who is it, Kaa?
- [Gulps] Uh, who?
[Coughs] Oh, no.
- I was just singing to myself.
- Indeed.
Yes. Yes, you see,
I have trouble with my s-s-sinuses.
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.
It's simply terrible. I can't eat.
I can't s-s-sleep, so I sing myself to sleep.
You know, self-hypnosis?
Let me show you how it works.
# Trust in me
- [muffled coughs]
- I can't be bothered with that.
I have no time for that sort of nonsense.
- [Hisses] Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.
But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.
"Man cub"? What man cub?
The one who's lost.
Now, where do you suppose he could be?
Search me.
That's an excellent idea. [chuckling]
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?
Uh, [hisses] certainly not.
Nothing here, and nothing in here.
[Snoring]
[Snorting]
My sinuses.
Hmm. Indeed.
And now, how about the middle?
The middle?
Oh, the middle.
[Laughing] Absolutely nothing in the middle.
Hmm.
Really?
Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub, you will inform me first.
- Understand?
- [Gulps] I get the point.
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.
And I must continue my search for the helpless little lad.
Ooh, who does he think he's fooling?
"Helpless little lad."
Ooh, he gives me the s-s-shivers.
Picking on that poor little helpless boy. [sighs]
Oh, yes.
The poor little helpless boy.
Aaah!
[Grunts, groans]
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.
It's like you said.
You can't trust anyone.
If I never see that skinny little shrimp again, it will be too soon.
Ooh, my s-s-sacroiliac.
[Thunder rumbling]
[Yawns]
Hey, Flaps. What we gonna do?
I don't know. What do you wanna do?
I've got it! Let's flap over to the east side of the jungle.
They've always got a bit of action, a bit of a swingin' scene.
Aw, come off it!
Things are right dead all over.
You mean you wish they were.
[Laughing]
[All laughing]
Very funny.
OK, so what we gonna do?
I don't know. What do you wanna do?
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do?"
"What we gonna do?"
"What you wanna do?"
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!
OK. What do you want to do?
Oh, blimey. There you go again.
The same notes again.
I've got it!
This time, I've really got it.
So you've got it.
So what we gonna do?
Hold it, lads.
Look. Look what's coming our way.
Hey, what in the world is that?
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.
Yeah, and they're all walking about by themselves.
[All laughing]
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Hey, now, don't start that again.
Come on, lads. Come on.
Let's have some fun with this little fella, this little bloke, eh?
Blimey! He's got legs like a stork, he has.
Like a stork. Ha ha!
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.
[Laughter]
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.
[Thunder rumbling]
What's wrong with him?
I think we overdid it.
We were just having a bit of fun, that's all.
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.
You know, he must be down on his luck.
Yeah, or he wouldn't be in our neighbourhood.
Hey, new kid! Wait a minute! Hey!
Just leave me alone.
Oh, come on. What's wrong?
You look like you haven't got a friend in the world.
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?
No. Nobody wants me around.
Yeah. We know how you feel.
Nobody wants us around either.
Oh, we may look a bit shabby, but we've got hearts.
And feelings too.
And just to prove it to you, we're going to let you join our little group.
Kid, we'd like to make you an honorary vulture.
Thanks, but I...
I'd rather be on my own alone.
Oh, now, look, kid.
Everybody's got to have friends.
Hey, fellas, are we his friends?
# We're your friends
[harmonizing]
# We're your friends
# We're your friends
to the bitter end
# The bitter end
# When you're alone
# When you're alone
# Who comes around
# Who comes around
# To pluck you up
- Give us a smile.
- # To pluck you up
# When you are down
# When you are down
# And when you're outside looking in
# Who's there to open the door?
- Come on, kid. We need a tenor.
- # That's
# What
# Friends are for
# Who's always eager to extend
# A friendly claw
# That's what friends are for
# And when you're lost
# In dire need
# Who's at your side
# At lightning speed
# We're friends with every creature
comin' down the pike
# In fact, we've never met
an animal we didn't like
Ha ha! You take it, kid.
# Didn't like
- # So, you can see we're friends
- # Friends in need
# We're friends in need
and friends indeed
# Friends indeed
- # Oh, friends indeed
- Whoops! Ooh!
- Easy, lads. Steady. Watch it!
- # We'll keep you safe in the jungle
# Forevermore
# That's what friends
# Are for #
Bravo. Bravo.
An extraordinary performance.
And thank you for detaining my victim.
Uh, don't mention it, Your Highness.
[Chuckling]
- Boo!
- [Sputtering, yelling]
- Let's get out of here.
- Gimme room! Gangway!
- [Thunder crashing]
- Run, friend! Run!
"Run"? Why should I run?
Why should you run?
Could it be possible that you don't know who I am?
I know you, all right.
- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.
Then you should also know that everyone runs from Shere Khan.
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.
Ah! You have spirit for one so small, and such spirit is deserving of a sporting chance.
Now, I'm going to close my eyes and count to ten.
It makes the chase more interesting... for me.
One...
...two, three...
...four...
You're trying my patience.
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- [Thunder crashing]
- [Growling]
Run, Mowgli, run!
- Let go, you big oaf!
- Ooh!
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Whoa!
- [Growling]
- Yeow! Whoa, slow! Easy, now!
- [Growling]
- [Stammering] Whoa! Easy!
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has.
And he better hang on too.
- Yeow!
- Take that, you big bully.
Let him have it again, kid!
Hit him again, kid! Go on!
- Baloo! Help me!
- [Shere Khan roaring]
Ooh!
Woo-woo-wooo-wooo!
- [Thunder crashing]
- [Growling]
Somebody do something with that kid!
Come on, lads!
He's safe now! Ha ha ha!
You can let go, Baloo.
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.
[Snarling]
- Ooof!
- [Thud]
- I'll kill you for this. [growling]
- [Thunder crashing]
Let go! Baloo needs help!
Fire! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.
Oof!
[All] Charge!
- Punch and blow!
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools!
Yeah, yeah. Missed me a mile, he did!
[Vultures laughing]
- Yeah, pull his blinkin' whiskers!
- [Laughter]
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is!
Look behind you, chum.
[Roaring]
[Snarling, roaring]
[Thunderclap]
- Well, that's the last of him.
- [Laughter]
[Laughter continues]
Old Stripes took off like a flaming comet, he did.
Well, come on. Let's go congratulate our friend.
Hold it, fellas.
Now is not the time for it. Look.
Baloo?
Baloo, get up.
Oh, please, get up.
[Sniffs] Oh.
Mowgli, try to understand.
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?
You've got to be brave, like Baloo was.
You... You don't mean...
Oh, no. Baloo.
[Sniffles]
Now, now. I know how you feel.
But you must remember, Mowgli,
"Greater love hath no one than he who lays down his life for his friend."
When great deeds are remembered in this jungle, one name will stand above all others:
Our friend, Baloo the bear.
[Sniffling] He's crackin' me up.
The memory of Baloo's sacrifice and bravery will forever be engraved on our saddened hearts.
Beautiful.
This spot where Baloo fell will always be a hallowed place in the jungle, for there lies one of nature's noblest creatures.
[Sniffling]
I wish my mother could have heard this.
It's best we leave now.
Come along, Man Cub.
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great!
There's more. Lots more!
Why, you big fraud!
[Stammers] You four-flusher!
I'm-I'm fed up! [sputtering]
- Baloo, you're all right!
- [Chuckles]
Who, me? Sure I am.
Never felt... better.
[Laughter]
- You sure had us worried.
- Aw, I was just takin' five.
You know, playin' it cool.
- [Chuckling] But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.
It's going to be a bit dull without the little bloke, isn't it?
Yeah. So what we gonna do?
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!
Hey, Baggy.
Too bad you missed the action.
You should have seen how I made a sucker out of Old Stripes with that left up in his face.
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him. "Wham!"
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.
- [Laughs] You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.
Nothing or nobody is ever gonna come between us again.
[Girl] # My own home
# My own home
# My own home
# My own home
- Look! What's that?
- [humming]
- Oh, it's the man-village.
- No, no. I mean that.
Forget about those.
They ain't nothing but trouble.
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.
So you've seen one. So let's go.
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.
- Mowgli, wait a minute!
- Oh, Baloo.
Let him have a better look.
[Humming continues]
# Father's hunting in the forest
# Mother's cooking in the home
# I must go to fetch the water
# Till the day that I am grown
# Till I'm grown
# Till I'm grown
# I must go to fetch the water
# Till the day that I am grown
[giggles]
# Then I will have a handsome husband
# And a daughter of my own
# And I'll send her to fetch the water
# I'll be cooking in the home
[humming]
# Then I'll send her to fetch the water
# I'll be cooking in my home #
Oh!
- She did that on purpose!
- Obviously.
[Humming]
Mowgli, come back. Come back.
Go on. Go on.
He's hooked.
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.
The boy couldn't help himself.
It was bound to happen.
Mowgli is where he belongs now.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
But I still think he'd have made one swell bear.
Well, come on, Baggy, buddy.
Let's get back to where we belong.
And get with the beat.
- # Look for the bare necessities
- [grunts]
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
[both] # I mean the bare necessities
# Are Mother Nature's recipes
# That bring the bare necessities
of life #
I believe in the playground.
It's my favouritest place in the whole wild world.
But two yesterdays ago a bad thing happened when we was playing there.
Some big boys took my brother's binky and buried it in the sandbox.
Binky bye-bye.
They maked my brother cry.
So I said: "Dilly, this is a job for the Bobfather."
You come to me on the day of this wedding, and ask me to take care of the boys who made your brother cry?
No. Dil just wants a new binky.
That's it? A binky?
I don't get to squeeze no one's head or pull no one's hair?
- No.
- Binky, peeze!.
Dumb baby. Can't even make a good wish. All right, kiss my ring.
Go send the next one in, and tell him to bring a sponge.
Nine, eleven, twenty...
Chuckie!. You're not supposed to look at your feet when you're dancing.
But I gots to, Susie. They just keep getting all tanglied up.
Faster, Phillip!.
We gots to get to the peoples on top.
- I gots dibs on the feets.
- Phil, Lil...
The Bobfather wants to see you now.
I can't believe
Angelica saw that movie last night.
I can't mother and merger at the same time.
She only saw a scene or two.
It couldn't have made an impression.
Bobfather, we founded this in our crib.
That's what you get for wiping your boogers on Cynthia.
So that's where I left them!
Let's give a round of applause to this week's number one newly-weds:
Mr and Mrs Lou and Lulu Pickles!
Let's show these whippersnappers how it's done.
I didn't get these plastic hips for nothing!
Think you'll ever tie the knot again?
'Cause I got a cousin who's lookin'.
Big bones, broad shoulders...
And she can eat her weight in cheese!
Thanks, Betty, but cheese gives me hives. So does dating.
Boy, Lou and Lulu sure can boogie.
You're like family to me, Finster.
Name your wish.
Gosh, Bobfather,
I don't know what to wish for.
Just pick something already!
I don't mean your nose!
Come on, Chuckie.
Granpa Lou's throwing the gardener.
I'll take that binky.
There you go, Drooly.
It fell off a truck.
See, Dilly? You got your wish.
- I'm really happy for you, Pop.
- Yeah, Lulu's a great lady.
Yep, she's a keeper! 'Course, no one will ever replace your mother.
It's her love in here that helped this old geezer love again.
Now it's time for a special dance for all the kids and their mums.
Mummy just loves dancing with her handsome boys.
Angelica!
Wait, Angelica! I think I know what I want to wish for.
I'd kinda like to have a new mummy.
Sorry, Finster, game's over. Besides,
I'm wanted on the dance floor.
But that's my wish.
It's getting late, Chuckie.
What do you say we head home?
Chuckie, what are you doing up?
I was just looking through some of our old things.
Remember your Wawa?
Your mummy made it for you.
Oh, Chuckie, your mum was an amazing woman.
I bet she's in heaven right now looking down on us.
I've been missing her so much, Chuckie.
Maybe we could use a mummy's touch around here.
Huh, little guy?
You got to love the lnternet.
Behold the future of dating.
What are they doing?
My daddy's helping your daddy catch some dates in a net.
- What are dates?
- Big raisins that make you poop.
- What is it with you babies and poop?
- Where do you want us to start?
Wow! My own web page!
"Chas Finster.
Bureaucrat. Bachelor."
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- Look, you already have 1 2 dates.
That's triple my lifetime record.
Look at this one. She loves sunsets, long walks on sandy beaches and "is not allowed in the state of Kentucky".
I don't know about this, Stu.
Let me put it to you this way.
Dates is for people like Mr Chuckie's dad who don't got no wife.
But why does Chuckie's daddy need a wife?
What I have to put up with!
'Cause if his daddy gets a new wife, then Chuckie gets a new mummy.
I'm really gonna get my wish?
Yeah, so long as you stay in my good flavour.
I didn't know she had a good flavour.
Guys! I'm gonna gets a mummy!
I bet she's gonna be clean and cuddly and nice.
- Sounds great, Chuckie.
- I hope she's not too clean.
Get off your derrieres and get this show on the road! Tout de suite!
I love the sound of panicked scurrying feet in the morning.
Don't you, Jean-Claude?
It moves me deeply, Madame.
That Reptar is a nuisance
He's a thorn in our side
The way things are going
Our village will be fried
That Stu Pickles!
I want that nincompoop inventor here within 24 hours, or another head will roll.
I'll take care of it personally.
Kira! Madame LaBouche wants her Pickles. Now!
Hello?
- Hello?
- Mr Pickles?
This is Kira Watanabe from EuroReptar.
Sorry to call so late, but the Reptar that you designed has broken down.
My boss is having a fit.
Reptar's a hit? That's great.
We need you to come to Paris on the next flight.
Paris. Oh yeah, the city of lights.
Madame kindly recommends that you...
Come with my family and friends?
Okey-dokey. Here...
HeLLo? Mr PickLes?
Are you stiLL there?
Hey, Dee, we're going to France.
Oh Stu, I'm too tired to dance.
France!
I'm going to France and you're not.
I already learned how to parsley-voo-francy.
Which, for your information, means "speak French".
No one likes a show-off, Susie.
We're headin' out, babies
There we go
Get your stubby legs moving
No time to pick your nose
We've got stuff to do
Let's take Spike too
We're on our way to France
Don't forget our underpants
We're heading out, babies
We're on our way
Here we go on a big exciting trip
We're heading up, up, up, up, up
Hang on to your diapies
Don't lose your bib
Get moving babies
I hope we're all packed
We don't know when we're gonna get back
No time to worry 'bout getting stinky
I hope you remember to pack your binky
We're taking off. Whee!
We're on our way to France, Paris
- How do you work this thing?
- I don't know.
I think I'm gonna scream.
Guess Robosnail thought he could fly.
Press a button, get a mummy!
I never saw a mummy button before.
Let's see what kind of mummy your button gots, Chuckie.
Hey, I wanted to press the button, Lillian!
You want the button, Phillip?
You can't handle the button!
Oh look, a toy that was already broken.
Unfortunately, the union forbids me from picking it up.
That's a job for your mummy.
Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bread.
- Let's try again.
- No, let's not, Lillian.
I'll just wait for the Bobfather to bring her. Whenever that is.
Let's go ask her.
She just sneaked behind that curtain.
- Hey, what's the big idea?
- Hi, Angelica!
For feet's sake! Can't you see this is the 'no dumb babies' section?
Sorry, but Chuckie was wondering when his new mummy was coming.
I'm...working on it.
And I almost had a good one, but I got so hungry
I had to sit down.
- Maybe you need a nap.
- Or cookies.
- Or cookies.
- And ice cream.
- Which happens to be in that kitchen!
- Be right back. Come on!
Where they going?
There's lots of neat stuff down here.
Like a hairy toothbrush, a 'tato chip.
Somebody must have losted their lunch.
Finster!
Look, Phillip, party hats.
Thanks a lot, diaper bags!
I smell a ripey diapie.
Come on, sweetie.
Time to get changed.
I want a mum that will last forever
I want a mum to make it all better
I want a mum that will last forever
I want a mum who will love me whatever
I want a mum to take my hand and make me feel like a holiday
A mum to tuck me in at night and chase the monsters away
I want a mum to read me stories and sing a lullaby
And if I have a bad dream to hold me when I cry
I want a mum that will last forever
I want a mum to make it all better
I want a mum that will last forever
I want a mum that will love me whatever
Forever
No one else is being picked up by a guy in a Reptar suit.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Welcome to Paris. I've been asked to take you directly to EuroReptarland.
Out of my way! The prettiest, smartest girl gets the front seat.
So why is she in such a hurry?
My tummy is all bubbaly.
Don't worry, Lil, I gots your baggie.
Lookie! Reptar's house!
Pokyo sure looks different on TB, huh?
Pokyo? Don't you know nothing?
This is Parrots!
You babies are as dumb here as you are at home.
Wee wee.
'Cept him.
He's speaking French already.
Welcome to EuroReptar.
Yeah, Reptarland!
Et voiLa!
Our Parisian pied-a-terre.
Pretty posh digs!
The beds are quite comfortable.
Yeah? Incoming!
So is the floor.
It's the most beautifullest potty
I ever seed.
I'm a diapie man myself.
A potty that squirts you back!
I don't know, you guys.
I squirt myself enough already.
We're off to the boutiques.
It's time to meet Ms LaBouche, the woman who made all this possible.
Shall we?
- It looks like you, me and the kids.
- Oui, oui, mon ami.
Come back!
Seems kind of odd to have a Japanese theme park in the middle of Paris.
It's a new century.
Just go with ""Le flLow"".
Bonjour. Welcome to EuroReptar.
And one of you must be Mr Pickles.
That would be moi. And this is my good friend Charles Finster.
- And this is my son, Chuckie.
- Hi, Chuckie. I like your bear.
What sweet children.
Is this your first time in Paris?
Well, France, yes. But I've been to Paris, Texas, a number of times.
Reptar's head!
Wonder if the Bobfather had anything to do with this.
Come on, Chuckie! It's a wadey pool!
- They look hungry.
- Must be lunchtime.
...just don't leave no fingerprints.
Where did those filthy little bookends come from?
What have you done to my priceless collection of koi fish?
I told you to get the piranha.
Call the dog catcher!
The exterminator! Do something!
Oui, Madame. Kira!
Come along, children.
Madame, Mr Pickles is here.
Oh, good. Send in the clown.
So, if it isn't the brilliant designer.
- I wouldn't say brilliant.
- Neither would l.
Let's take the babies to see the Princess Parade while they get better acquainted.
The kids would love that.
See this face?
I never want to make this face again!
Now get to work.
Sure. Mechanical expertise is my middle name.
Then your first name should be
"l have no".
Sorry to interrupt your episode, but it's the boss on the phone.
Monsieur Yamaguchi, so nice to see you.
I"m stepping down as president ofl Yamaguchi Industries.
I"ve begun a search flor my repLacement.
Splendid! I accept.
You are one ofl many under consideration.
But I have made millions for this company!
The candidate shouLd not be concerned onLy with money.
They must understand what it means to bring joy to chiLdren.
In flact, they themseLves must have the heart ofl a chiLd.
I must have one in a jar somewhere.
In fact, I'm engaged to a wonderful man with a baby thing all his own.
CongratuLations, Madame.
I Look florward to the wedding and seeing you with your new flamiLy.
We"LL discuss the promotion then.
Goodbye.
What now, Pinocchio?
Years of clawing my way to the top gone to waste.
Why am I not some child's tender mother?!
Why?! Why?! Why?!
Because you hate children and men find you to be a heartless shrew?
There has to be a spineless little man with a brat of his own out there.
Bonjour?
My chocolates are in her little
American stomach! Get them back!
- Open wide. Say, "aah".
- No, wait!
You have five seconds to come up with a reason why I should not lock you up for ever and ever.
Because I can stick five raisins up my nose, and sing real good and...
- For ever and ever is a long time!
- Tick tock...
I know where you can find a spiny little man with a brat of his own.
I think I just made a friend.
Isn't this neat, Chuckie?
There's something weird about a guy in a ponytail and a dress.
Golly, Kira, you're a natural.
I have a beautiful little girl to thank.
Kimi. She's almost two.
So's my Chuckie!
Not a girl, I mean, but you know...
Look! The Princess is coming.
Once upon a time there was a mighty dinosaur named Reptar.
Everyone ran away from him except the beautiful princess.
She was not afraid, because she could see that Reptar was not vicious.
He was lonely and unhappy.
So she promised to take care of him and keep him safe and loved for ever and ever.
For eber and eber...
My mummy says Mr Chuckie's dad is so desperate that he'll marry the first lady that plops the question.
Excellent! Now run along before you give me lice.
Hey! What do I get out of this deal?
- Why should I give you anything?
- I don't know...
I could accidentally tell someone why you want to marry Mr Chuckie's dad?
An extra scoop for cunning.
Tell Auntie Coco what you desire.
Let's see. Not much. Just my own float in the Reptarland parade with matching ponies and my own fashion show and to be the flower girl at your wedding.
And who said Americans are greedy?
I'll take care of it, Angelique.
Find out where our guests are dining tonight. Love is on the menu.
This place gots the biggest babies I ever sawed.
That's got to be one stinky diapie.
When I came to France,
I had dreams of bouiLLabaisse, crepe suzette, chicken cordon bLeu.
Well, I had dreams of eating with a fork. Pass the squid brains.
It's Karaoke time!
Well, do-re-mi!
Bad girl
Talkin' 'bout the sad girl
Bad girl
Talkin' 'bout the bad bad girl
- Eat all the cookies in plain sight
- Chewin'
- Pickin' on the dumb babies
- Always have to be right
They're so easy to trick and tease
'Cause they don't know a thing, baby
When I seed the magic sprinklies in my hand, I knowed she was the one.
You mean you want the Princess to be your new mummy?
Yup. She's everything
I've been wishin' for.
She's real nice, she loves Reptar.
And bestest of all, we could live happily forever after.
Stewart, what a surprise!
Everyone, this is Madame LaBouche.
MademoiseLLe.
Who is this devastatingly handsome man you are trying to hide from me?
That's my good friend Chas Finster.
Enchantee.
Bonsoir, MademoiseLLe.
Call me Coco.
And that adorable misproportioned ragamuffin must be your son.
Madame LaBouche!
- Hi, Kira.
- What?!
I'm sorry to interrupt, but these need your signature.
- Can you join us for dinner?
- You're much too busy, Kira.
That's too bad.
That must be Kimi!
- Who?
- My daughter.
Of course.
So, Kimi, do you and your mummy and daddy live in Reptarland?
Not exactly. It's just me and my mummy, and we live in Paris.
But I gets to come here all the time.
- You met the Princess?
- Sure. Lots of times.
She lives in that castle on that bowlcano and comes out between 'splosions.
Now we know where to find your new princess mum, Chuckie.
Chuckie?
Sorry, I stopped listening after 'splosions.
Would Kimi like to come to the park with me and the kids tomorrow?
What a coincidence! I planned to spend the day with her there myself.
- But, Madame! You never...
-...tire of taking care of Kimi.
So, it's a date!
It'll just be you and me and that adorable swarm of infants.
Wow! Robosnail!
I think I'm in love.
Hi, Robie.
Why didn't you follow my design?
I used paper clips and rubber bands for a reason!
I love their fries, but this is advanced robotics.
- It looks pretty complicated.
- Actually, it's not.
You just put on the gear, and anything you do, Reptar does.
It's so simple, a child could work it. Right, champ?
Sorry!
Did I say child? I meant young adult.
Bonjour, everyone!
- Ready to go, mon cheri?
- Let me just get Dilly settled.
And how is this precious gherkin today?
You're just a lawsuit waiting to happen, aren't you?
Mon cheri, I could listen to your fascinating health history all day.
I'll tell you about my sinus drainage when I get back from the restroom.
Would you mind holding Dil?
- Of course not.
- This should be good.
So, we meet again.
How delightful.
Kira! They're staring at me, and this child is leaking from the mouth!
- What do I do?
- Just smile and be nice.
Hello! You are not horrible.
Let go!
Do you know how much I paid for these lips?
I don't think Dil likes that lady too much.
Stop it, you dripping urchin!
I don't think she likes Dil too much, either.
She's not a very nice lady.
She's too pointy.
- He's crying. What do I do now?
- Comfort him. Gently bounce him.
According to Lipschitz,
Dilly just gave you a gift.
Why wouldn't he?
After all, children, they are my life!
I have that poem taped to the refrigerator!
- Pardon?
- "Children Are My Life", a classic.
"Dappled laughter, patting feet"...
"Joy and wonder, heaven's treat", it's one of my favourites!
"Joy and wonder, heaven's treat", it's one of my favourites.
Oh dear, they're getting fussy.
- Take them to Ooey Gooey World.
- Ooey Gooey World?
Ooey Gooey World! What a great idea!
Behind the couch is a Land ofl smudge
A home to wrappers, toys and fludge
Gummi bears, baLLs ofl hair...
Kira, remind me to eliminate whoever wrote this hideous song!
Look! No hands!
Look! It's so soft and squishiful.
Yeah, it's good stuff.
Let's stock up.
And eggsackly how am I opposed to find the Princess with my glasses all googlied up?
Here.
Thanks, I guess.
Look, the castle!
Let's go see that Princess, Chuckie!
They said to keep your hands and feet inside at all times.
- That didn't stop her!
- I'll show you the short cup!
Kimi, no! You guys!
- What are you waiting for?
- Great. Another Tommy.
Kimi! Madame, the babies are gone!
Finally. What? No!
Wait! Get them back before Wheezy finds out!
Security, we have an emergency situation!
Lifle is a party
Let"s get it started, get it started, get it started tonight
Lifle is a party
Get excited, you"re invited
There"s a party tonight
All this goo is giving me a diapie rash!
Imagine everyone in the worLd
Out in the street tonight
Everbody"s gonna rock aLL day
To start it by party time
Lifle is a party
Let"s get excited, you"re invited
There"s a party tonight
Lifle is a party, oh yeah
I told you I knowed a short cup!
That was the longest short cup
I ever tooked.
Zere zey are!
- There's the Princess!
- lsn't she beautiful?
Oh, no! She's gone!
Go get her, Chuckie.
She's right inside.
You're right, Tommy.
I'm gonna do it.
But what if she doesn't like me?
Go ahead, Chuckie.
You'll never know unless you try.
Go ahead, Chuckie.
ALLez-hoop, little baby.
Ze babies have been apprehended.
On our way back to Ooey Gooey World.
At least we didn't have to walk back.
Look, mon cheri.
I think he likes me.
Oh, La! Ca va pas, non!
Chien! Va-t"en!
We're both lactose intolerant, love kids, and she finds bureaucrats fascinating.
- Who doesn't, you babe magnet!
- Just be careful, Charles.
- You shouldn't rush into anything.
- I won't, don't worry.
First I have to see how Coco and Chuckie get along.
He and I are a team, you know.
- Tommy?
- Yeah, Chuckie?
Do you think someone like me could ever learn to be brave
Iike you, my daddy and Reptar?
- Sure.
- But how, Tommy?
You could try thinking of something else next time you feel a-scared.
I tried that once, but I just thought of something scarier.
Why don't you try thinking about stuff that makes you feel good?
You mean like my Reptar nightlight or my Happy Hippo blankie or my favouritest moon rock?
Or... Or a new mummy?
Next time I see the Princess,
I'm gonna be brave.
Sweet dreams, Chuckie.
What's this? A gold inhaler?
Gee, most hotels just leave mints.
"Chad, you take my breath away."
"Forever yours, Coco."
"Chad"?
Ifl you"ve been chased around by a Kung-Fu choppin" cLown
He"LL come sLidin" to the rescue
Ifl your rickshaw"s been attacked by a Samurai pack
- He"LL break up the party
- Ifl he"s not on the potty
You don"t have to worry
He"s got flists ofl flury
His masterfuL karate kicks turn dragons into chopsticks
- Here comes Chuckie Chan
- Here comes Chuckie Chan
He"s aLways ready when there"s danger at hand
- Here comes Chuckie Chan
- Here comes Chuckie Chan
MartiaL arts expert ofl ReptarLand
- I am!
- Yeah, that'll be the day!
He makes bad guys say they"re sorry with the sight ofl his hand
- Here comes Chuckie Chan
- Here comes Chuckie Chan
MartiaL arts expert ofl ReptarLand
Go, Chuckie!
HeLLo?
Chuckie! You've got to get ready.
Angelica says we're gonna get to see the Princess in a show with Reptar.
- This could be your chance.
- I'm gonna meet the Princess?
I'm gonna meet the Princess!
Gee, Tommy, maybe I should take her a present.
Something real nice, so she knows how much I want her to be my mummy.
You want a princess to be your mum?
- What about Coco?
- Who?
Mr Chuckie's dad's girlfriend.
The Reptarland lady.
That lady's not the Princess.
I'm gonna get the real Princess for my mummy.
Listen up! I'm supposed to ride in my own parade on a float with pink tarnations and ponies and you better not mess it up for me!
I know somebody who needs a nap.
Viens ici. Viens ici.
Cheri, cheri, oui. C"est Ca.
Bon appetit, petit chiens.
The show's gonna start!
Who gots the cookies?
- Right here!
- Yum!
- Yeah, tasty.
- Looks like a booger.
Bonjour, mes amis.
Let me show you to your seats.
Thank you for the inhaler, Coco.
Whenever I wheeze, I'll think of you.
Who said
Americans are not romantic?
How is Coco's favourite boy?
He must be excited about the show.
Eating this goo is making my tummy bubbly.
I thought you could only do that in the bathtub.
Hi, Mr Chuckie's dad's girlfriend.
How's my float coming along?
We're waiting for the ponies.
I still get the float if Mr Chuckie's dad marries a princess and not you?
What?! Why do you ask?
'Cause... Well...
The Finster kid is planning on getting a princess for a mum.
Let's face it, lady, you're no princess.
Not a princess? Well!
- If the tiara fits, wear it.
- I smell trouble.
Oh, the Princess!
She's beautiful!
Reptar, he's no ordinary monster
He's a lizard with a heart of gold
Don't believe the lies you've been told
He's a fire-breathing child to me
I see sweetness when I look into those large yellow eyes
He's got a sensitive stare
One that can hypnotise
He may be rough on the outside
I hate it when they sing.
He's the kindest monster
I've ever met
See how nice his head stays on?
Reptar, I'll protect you
Reptar, I'll hold you
And I'll be there for you, Reptar and never go away
Reptar, I'll protect you
Reptar, I love you
I'll be there for you, Chuckie forever and a day
For eber and eber...
I'll be there for you
Wow, he's sharing Wawa!
Forever and a day!
Madame LaBouche?
- That lady's the Princess?
- She can't be!
Bravo!
Bravo! Isn't she talented?
Gosh, you guys, I think
Chuckie and I are both in love.
- Say brie!
- Brie!
Merci.
I'm delighted that you've met someone special here in Paris.
But aren't you rushing things?
Marriage is a big step.
Why wait, Deed?
They're two crazy kids in love.
My tummy's not been this happy in forever!
Looks like it's time for dessert.
Get us something good, Dilly.
Sure is gonna be great having my princess mummy.
- lsn't it?
- Of course it is, Chuckie.
Then how come I don't feel so good?
Well...
Maybe this thing is too tight.
Do you see those sticky fingers?
Jam-covered mouths?
Dirty little faces? Disinfect them!
What are you doing with that mangy thing? Give me that!
How dare you defy me!
You babies are in trouble now.
You are going to be mine, you will do things my way!
Jean-Claude, take those wretched dustmops away!
I will not have them ruining my wedding day!
- You babies will miss the wedding.
- And don't forget the big mouth.
My pleasure, Madame.
Take your hands off me, you big bully!
- I'm the flower girl!
- I feel your pain, Mademoiselle.
Unfortunately, you just got ""Le boot"".
But what about my float and my matching ponies?
- Madame LaBouche!
- Burn this hideous moth-eaten toy.
I never want to see it again.
Notre Dame, and move it.
You cannot go through with this.
- You don't love Chas or Chuckie.
- Which is which again?
I can no longer stand by and watch you destroy their lives.
I will tell Chas the truth, there's nothing you can do to stop me.
Except throw you out on the kerb.
Au revoir!
Looks like our little mouse is up for the chase. Step on it.
I'm sorry, guys.
If I didn't want a princess mummy so bad, we wouldn't be in this terrible place.
It's not so terrible.
I mean, at least we gots Reptar to keep us company.
I decided I don't want a princess mummy no more.
I don't need the magic and sparkly dust.
Alls I wants is a real mummy like you guys gots.
I want a mummy who smiles and talks nice to me and tucks me in at night and tells me stories.
And...who loves me.
Come on, Finster, don't cry.
I can't help it, Angelica.
I feel bad.
My daddy's marrying a lady who doesn't like me or my Wawa or my friends.
Actually, Finster, it's sort of my fault.
- What do you mean, Angelica?
- Let me see, where do I start?
Mr Yummyhoochie told the French lady you can't have joy without a heart.
She had one in a jar, but she needed a spiny man with a kid.
I said you wanted a princess mum, and she promised me a pony float, but she made it all up!
I helped that lady trick your daddy into marrying her!
You did? But...
Bad yucky! Bad!
Pipe down, Drooly!
Dilly's right! That's one of the worstest things you've ever done!
I know it was bad. Even for me.
Sometimes I just can't help myself.
I'm sorry, Chuckie.
You guys, I can't let that lady marry my daddy!
It's like you say, Tommy:
"A baby's got to do what a baby's got to do."
And we gots to stop that wedding!
How are you gonna do that, Chuckie?
Actually, I was hoping that you had an idea, Tommy.
Finally we get to see an authentic
Parisian landmark: Notre Dame.
You seen one church, you seen them all.
Wake me if you spot a hunchback.
I wonder where Jean-Claude is with the kids.
I can't start without my little guy.
What do you think you're doing?
Just practising tying shoes.
Children are so easily amused.
SacrebLeu!
Thank you for flying Air Angelica.
- I told you we could do it, Chuckie.
- If we could just find the door.
There's one.
Hey, you dumb babies, wait for me!
- Tommy, we forgetted Angelica.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.
- We gots to go back.
- I don't know if I can, Tommy!
I barely know how to go forward.
Wait for me! Do you know how hard it is to run in a flower girl dress?
I'm opposed to be at that wedding!
Take me to the church!
Reptar's boogers look just like Angelica.
Hold on, Angelica!
Good catch, Chuckie!
This is not the parade I wanted!
Keep that Kira out until after the very last "l do"!
- Goodness! Here comes the bride!
- Without the Wedding March?
- Without the flower girl?
- Without Chuckie?
- Go, go, go! Start.
- Coco, Chuckie's not here yet.
- Darling, we'll tell him about it.
- I want to share this with my son.
That is what videotape is for.
Go ahead!
Bonjour, everyone.
I'd like to welcome the family and friends of Monsieur and Madame...
Let's begin!
- What you drawing, Kimi?
- It's a green thumb.
- It's a pickle with legs.
- It's Reptar.
- Right!
- No, I mean, it's really Reptar!
- How do we get out of here?
- I think it's that way.
No, that way. Or that way.
As long as you're sure.
Hiya, Reptar!
Kimi looks like a bug from here.
Let's pick her up!
I've never been on this ride before!
Hey, pipsqueak, get your own float!
Going somewhere, my reptilian friend?
You babies cannot hide from Jean-Claude, Super-Escargot!
Charles would like to recite a poem to his bride.
It's our favourite, remember?
I'll have you babies for lunch!
But not without the proper sauce.
- You want a piece of me, sluggy?
- Move over, pipsqueak!
I'll show you how it's done!
- Stop wobbling, Chuckie!
- Don't tell me, tell my feet.
My shell!
Stop, in the name of France!
Look, Chuckie!
I think they want us to stop.
So do l!
Okay then, don't stop.
"Squeaky giggles, wiggly toes"
"Teeny tiny button nose"
- "Rosy lips and soft wet kisses"
- What?!
Madame, the babies are on their way to the church.
What? You bumbling idiot, you disgust me!
Auntie sends her love.
Come on! Give it some gas!
No offence, but could somebody maybe open a window?
Okay. Hello, guys!
'Bout time you tinkleheads came to the rescue.
Tag! You're it!
Babies go round and round
I'll launch them from the ground
They will go flying now
Their mummies have a cow
Look, up in the sky!
- It's a nerd!
- It's a pain!
It's Angelica.
What's the big idea? Are you pottyheads trying to get rid of me?
That was the big idea.
Can you see the church?
There it is!
Chuckie, you're my hero.
Hang on, you guys.
I think I got a wedgie.
"Grasping fingers, dimpled chin"
"Pudgy bellies, velvet skin"
Enough poetry! Marry us now!
- Look, Chuckie, we're almost there!
- Yeah, there's the church.
Hello, my toddling tourists.
This is where your tour of Paris comes to an end!
We gots to beat Robosnail, or that mean lady's gonna be your mummy!
Over my dead potty!
En garde, babies!
Out of my way, slugface!
- You did it, Chuckie!
- Yeah, I did!
Now let's go save my daddy.
- For better or worse. Next!
- For richer or...
-...poorer! Sickness...
-...and in health.
Must we repeat everything?
Dear Lord, I skipped a section!
Hurry, Chuckie!
- Look what I found.
- Papie clips and bubber bands!
I'm coming, Daddy!
- Go, Chuckie, go!
- Hurry!
You can do it, Chuckie!
If anyone objects to this union, speak now or forever hold your peace.
I gots to be brave.
I gots to be brave.
No!
Chuckie?
He said his first word.
He's talking!
No!
Chuckie! Chuckie!
It's okay, it's okay. Daddy's here.
And so is his new mummy.
Come here, little boy.
No! No! No! No!
Madame!
Our kidnapping plot has failed!
Ignore that unemployed fool.
Coco, the wedding is off. You are not the woman I thought you were.
Hey, lady! Looks like your plan to trick Mr Yummy-sushi didn't work!
Pretty flower girls should be seen, not heard.
I would like to hear what the little one has to say.
But listen good, 'cause I'm tired of telling this story.
That koo-koo lady told her boss she had a kid's heart in a jar, and she was gonna marry Mr Chuckie's daddy so she could be president.
- Listen, you traitor!
- Miss LaBouche, you are dismissed.
Dismissed?
But no one fires Coco LaBouche.
Coco LaBouche fires others!
Coco LaBouche is EuroReptar.
Off the gown, you revolting carpet mice!
Listen, lady! Nobody messes with my dumb babies 'cept me!
I see London, I see France!
I see Coco's underpants!
Take a picture! This is the last time you will see Coco or her underpants!
Bad dog! Bad dog!
Coco! Wait!
Go get him, Spike!
Looks like Spike found himself a little patootie.
Come here, my little pumpkin pies!
- Smile for the camera!
- What a holiday!
Chuckie? I have something that belongs to you.
Thank you, Kira.
Chas, I am so sorry. I wanted to tell you about Coco, but...
No, no, no, it's my fault, Kira.
I guess I got caught up in the romance of Paris.
I'm sorry, little guy.
"Oh, how my heart beats wild"
"each time I hold my precious child"
Wait! You know that poem?
It is my favourite.
And now the bride and groom wiLL cut the cake.
Be careful, Kira, the knife is very sharp.
Wasn't the wedding beautiful?
I'm glad I didn't have to return the toaster oven this time.
Let me put it this way, Bobfather.
We've been back home for a bunch of yesterdays, and you still haven't delivered the goods!
You gots your mummy wish, so what do I get, Snotfather?
Angelica, you show him no aspect!
You can't talk to him like...
Angelica...
You come to me on the day of my daddy's wedding to ask me for Cynthia Chateau and the matching ponies and a bunch of this stuff that I can't never get you.
There you are! Come on, the grown-ups are giving away all the cake!
Cake? Game over!
Wawa's a really nice bear.
Thanks. My old mummy gived it to me.
- Do you ever miss her?
- Sometimes.
But then I 'member that she's up there watching me from heaben.
I guess I'm lucky. I got two mummies to look after me now.
There's my little guy.
Kimi? Sweetheart?
May I have this dance?
Chuckie, would you like to dance with your new mummy?
Let me at that cake!
Hey, lady, ever hear of a thigh blaster?
Cynthia! That frosting flower has our names bitten all over it!
Who do you babies think you are?
I'm Tommy, and this is Lil...
- And she calls us dumb.
- Give me that cake right now!
- Good frow, Dilly.
- Prepare to meet your caker!
What you doing?
Hey, Susie!
Cakey!
Well, Tommy, I guess this is how it's gonna be from now on.
The second star to the right
Shines in the night for you
To tell you that the dreams you plan
Really can come true
The second star to the right
Shines with a light so rare
And if it's Never Land you need
Its light will lead you there
Twinkle, twinkle little star
So we'll know where you are
Gleaming in the skies above
Lead us to the land
We dream of
And when ourjourney is through
Each time we say
Good night
We'll thank the little star that shines
The second from
The right
All this has happened before.
And it will all happen again.
But this time it happened in London.
It happened on a quiet street in Bloomsbury.
That corner house over there is the home of the Darling family.
And Peter Pan chose this particular house... because there were people here who believed in him.
There was Mrs Darling.
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't be late for the party, you know.
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan was the spirit of youth.
- But Mr Darling--
- Mary, unless I find my cuff links... we don't go to the party.
And if we don't go to the party, I can never show my face in the office again.
And if I can never-- Ouch!
Well, Mr Darling was a practical man.
The boys, however,
John and Michael... believed Peter Pan was a real person... and made him the hero of all their nursery games.
Blast you, Peter Pan!
Take that! Give up,
Captain Hook? Give up?
Never! I'll teach you to cut off me hand!
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Wendy.
Wendy, the eldest, not only believed... she was the supreme authority on Peter Pan... and all his marvellous adventures.
Oh, Nana, must we always take that nasty tonic?
Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog... kept her opinions to herself... and viewed the whole affair with a certain tolerance.
Take that!
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!
And I'll cut you to pieces.
- Aha!
- Ouch!
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry,John.
You'll never leave this ship alive!
Oh, yes, I will.
Take that!
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.
Oh, no, you won't.
Back, back, back, you villain!
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!
- Aha, I got ya.
- You didn't either.
You never touched me.
Take that and that!
And that!
Boys, boys, less noise, please.
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael--
Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.
Uh, have you seen my cuff--
Oh, Nana, for goodness sake!
Where are those cuff links?
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?
- I don't know.
- The map then.
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.
And hereafter--
Don't paw me, Michael.
This is my last clean--
No! No!
George, dear, we really must hurry or we'll be late--
- Mary, look!
- George.
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.
- And Wendy says--
- Wendy? Story?
I might have known. Wendy!
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?
- Would you kindly ex--
- Oh, Mother!
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.
- Wendy.
-Just my old gown made over.
- But it did turn out rather nicely, didn't--
- Mary, if you don't mind.
- I'd like--
- Why, Father, what have you done to your shirt?
What have I-- Oh!
- Now, George, really.
It comes right off.
- That's no excuse.
Wendy, haven't I warned you?
Stuffing the boys' heads with a lot of silly stories.
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are.
Captain Crook!
Peter Pirate!
- Peter Pan, Father.
- Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!
- Oh, no, Father. Father, have you--
- Oh, you don't understand.
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous--
- Now, George.
- ""Now, George.''
""Now, George''!
Well, ""Now, George,'' will have his say!
- Please, dear.
- Mary, the child's growing up.
It's high time she had a room of her own.
- Father!
- George!
- What?
- No!
- I mean it!
Young lady, this is your last night in the nursery.
And that's my last word on the matter--
No!
No!
Oh!
Poor Nana.
""Poor Nana''?
This is the last straw!
Out! Out, I say!
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!
There'll be no more dogs for nursemaids in this house!
Goodbye, Nana.
""Poor Nana.''
Oh, yes, ""Poor Nana.''
But ""Poor Father''?
Oh, no!
Blast it!
Where is that rope?
Oh, thank you.
Dash it all, Nana, don't look at me like that.
It's nothing personal.
It's just that--
Well, you're not really a nurse at all.
You're, well, a dog.
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.
And sooner or later, Nana, people have to grow up.
But, Mother,
I don't want to grow up.
Now, dear, don't worry about it any more tonight.
He called Peter Pan
""absolute poppycock.''
I'm sure he didn't mean it,John.
Father was just upset.
Poor Nana, out there all alone.
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.
She'll be all right.
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.
Don't judge your father too harshly.
After all, he really loves you very much.
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.
- ""He''?
- Yes, uh, Peter Pan.
You see, I found something that belongs to him.
- Oh? And what's that?
- His shadow.
- ""Shadow''?
- Mmm, Nana had it.
But I--
I took it away.
Oh? Yes, of course.
Good night, dear.
But, George, do you think the children will be safe without Nana?
Safe? Of course they'll be safe. Why not?
Well, Wendy said something about a shadow, and I--
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.
Oh, Peter Pan--
Peter Pan!
You don't say. Goodness gracious, whatever shall we do?
- But, George-- Really, I--
- Sound the alarm!
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible, childish fiddle-faddle.
Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the children to grow up and be practical...
- George, dear.
- when you're as bad as they are.
- Please.
- No wonder Wendy gets these idiotic ideas.
Over there, Tink, in its den.
Is it there?
Must be here somewhere.
Tink! Shh!
Stop playing and help me find my shadow.
Shadow. Oh, shadow.
Huh?
Aha!
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.
You know, you look exactly the way I thought you would.
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then--
Oh, you can't stick it on with soap, Peter.
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.
Although, come to think of it,
I've never thought about it before.
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean.
Of course, I knew it was your shadow the minute I saw it.
And I said to myself, I said, ""I'll put it away for him until he comes back.
Oh, he's sure to come back.''
And you did, didn't you, Peter?
After all, one can't leave his shadow lying about and not miss it sooner or later.
Uh, don't you agree? But what
I still don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.
She really isn't-- Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.
- Although Father says--
- Girls talk too much.
Yes, girls talk too--
Hmm? Oh.
- Well, get on with it, girl.
- Uh, my name is Wendy.
- Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl--
- Wendy's enough.
Oh, uh, but how did
Nana get your shadow, Peter?
Jumped at me the other night at the window.
Well, what were you doing there?
- I came to listen to the stories.
- My stories?
- But they're all about you.
- Of course.
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.
The Lost Boys--
Oh, I remember.
- They're your men.
- Uh-huh.
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.
- Why?
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.
- Grow up!
- Tonight's my last night in the nursery.
But that means no more stories.
- Mm-hmm.
- No!
I won't have it.
Come on!
Bu-Bu-But where are we going?
To Never Land.
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.
Oh, Peter, it will be so wonderful.
But wait.
What would Mother say?
Mother? What's Mother?
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who-- who loves and cares for you.
- And-- And tells you stories--
- Good! You can be our mother.
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, I--
Let me see now.
I-I have to pack.
Oh, and I must leave a note when I'll be back.
Of course, I couldn't stay too long.
And then I'll have to--
Oh, but Never Land.
Oh, I--
I-I'm so happy I--
I think I'll give you a-- a kiss.
What's a-- a kiss?
Oh, well, uh,
I-I'll show you.
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop it, Tink!
John,John, wake up!
He's here.
Huh? Jiminy!
Ooh, what in the world was that?
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.
Hello, Peter Pan.
I'm Michael.
And my name is John.
How do you do?
- Hello.
- Oh, look, a firefly.
- A pixie.
- Amazing!
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.
Oh. Well, I think she's lovely.
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!
- Peter's taking us.
- ""Us''?
Well, of course. I-I couldn't go without Michael and John.
Oh, I should like very much to cross swords with some real buccaneers.
Yes, and fight pirates too.
Well, all right, but ya gotta take orders.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.
But, Peter, how do we get to Never Land?
- Fly, of course.
- ""Fly''?
It's easy. All you have to do is to-- is to--
Is to--
- Ha! That's funny.
- What's the matter?
- Don't you know?
- Oh, sure.
It's-- It's just that
I never thought about it before.
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.
- Any happy, little thought?
- Uh-huh.
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?
Yep! Watch me now.
Here I go!
It's easier than pie.
- He can fly!
- He can fly!
He flewed!
- Now you try.
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon... underneath a magic moon.
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave.
I think I'll be an Indian brave.
Now everybody try.
One, two, three!
We can fly! We can fly!
We can fly!
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?
All it takes is faith and trust.
Oh! And something
I forgot. Dust!
- Dust?
- Dust?
Yep, just a little bit of pixie dust.
Now, think of the happiest things.
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.
Look! We're rising off the floor.
-Jiminy!
- Oh, my! We can fly!
- You can fly!
- We can fly!
Come on, everybody.
Here we go!
Off to Never Land!
Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas
Think of snow
Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake you'll see him wink his eye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Up you go with a heigh and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true
Come on, Nana!
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find
When you leave the world behind and bid your cares goodbye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
There it is, Wendy. Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find when you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
A-rovin'over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer
It's the life of a pirate for me, oh
The life of a pirate for me
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
They never bury your bones
For when it's all over a jolly sea rover drops in on his friend, Davy Jones
Oh, my good friend
Davy Jones
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?
Here we are, collecting barnacles on this miserable island.
While his nibs plays ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.
Look out. It might go off.
We ought to be tending to the business of looting ships.
Why, I've almost forgotten how to slit a throat.
- Better hop it.
- And tell the captain... we wants to put to sea, see?
Peter Pan--
Blast that Peter Pan!
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.
But where is it?
Mermaid Lagoon?
No, we've searched that.
We've combed Cannibal Cove.
H-Here! No. No, no, no!
That's Indian terri--
But wait.
Those redskins know this island better than I do me own ship.
Ah...
I wonder.
- Good morning, Captain.
- I've got it!
Tiger Lily, Smee!
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?
Oh, a little persuasion might be in order.
Now let me see.
Boiling in oil?
Keelhauling? Marooning?
A pirate's life is a wonderful l-life
You'll find adventure and sport
But live every minute for all that is in it
The life of a pirate is short
Oh, the life--
Now let me see, where was I?
Oh, dear, dear, dear Captain Hook.
Shooting a man in the middle of his cadenza?
It ain't good form, you know.
""Good form,'' Mr Smee?
Blast good form!
Did Pan show good form when he did this to me?
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was only a childish prank, you might say.
Aye! But throwing it to the crocodile!
That cursed beast liked the taste of me so well... he's followed me ever since, licking his chops... for the rest of me.
And he'd have had you by now, Captain... if he hadn't swallowed that alarm clock.
But now when he's about, he warns ya as ya might say with his tick-tock... tick-tock, tick-tock.
Smee? Smee!
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee! Smee!
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, Captain, all clear.
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.
What you need is a shave.
A nice soothing shave.
There now.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
A-sailing over the sea
Give me a career as a--
Captain, you know,
I can't help noticin'... you just ain't been your usual jolly self of late.
Give me a career as a buccaneer
And the crew's gettin' a might uneasy, Captain.
That is, what's left of it.
Now, why don't we put to sea, see? Leave Never Land.
Forget Peter Pan.
There now!
Give me a career as a buccaneer
We'd all be a lot happier, not to mention a lot healthier.
Captain? Oh, dear! I never shaved him this close before.
Now, don't worry, Captain.
I-It must be somewhere about.
Get up, you idiot!
Aye, aye, sir.
Ooh! I found it, Captain.
- Good as new.
- Why, you blithering blockhead!
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?
Three points off the starboard bow!
Swoggle me eyes!
It is Pan!
Headed this way with some more of those scurvy brats!
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!
A-Aye, aye, sir. Uh, pipe up the crew. Uh, pipe up the crew.
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
Look alive, you swabs!
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, Captain.
Man the Long Tom, you bilge rats!
- I've waited years for this.
- That's not countin' the holidays either.
Double the powder and shorten the fuse!
Shorten the powder and double the fuse!
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.
We'll pot 'em like sitting ducks.
- All right, men! Range 42.
- ""Range 42.''
- Elevation 65.
- ""Elevation 65.''
- Three degrees west.
- ""Three degrees west.''
Steady now! Steady!
Oh, Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.
Oh, look,John, there's Mermaid Lagoon.
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!
Oh, look, there's
Captain Hook and the pirates.
Look out!
Quick, Tink, take Wendy and the boys to the island.
I'll stay here and draw Hook's fire.
Hook! Hook!
You codfish! Here!
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.
We can't keep up with you.
Tinker Bell! Wait!
Ouch!
So!
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?
- You! That's who!
I'll show you!
Huh? Orders from Pan?
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.
- ""Wendy Bird''?
- Flying this way?
- Uh, Pan's orders are--
What? Smash it?
- Kick it?
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?
- Oh! Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!
- Yeah!
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!
- Follow Tink!
- Let's go!
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!
- I see it!
- Me too!
- Me too!
Ready, aim... fire!
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.
Good heavens, Wendy, you might have been killed.
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!
- Hey, Pan, I got it with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!
Attention! Well...
I'm certainly proud of you, you blockheads!
- I bring ya a mother to tell ya stories--
- A mother?
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!
- Tink said what?
- Well, she said you said to shoot it down!
Tinker Bell. Tink!
Come here. You're charged with high treason, Tink.
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty? But don't ya know ya might have killed her?
Tinker Bell!
I hereby banish you forever.
Please, not forever.
Well, for a week then. Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?
- Aw, let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.
Personally, I should prefer to see the aborigines.
- And the Indians too.
- All right, men!
Go out and capture a few Indians.
-John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.
Forward! March!
- Come on, bear.
- Oh, Michael, do be careful.
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

Oh, Blackfoot tribe.
Belongs to the Algonquin group.
- Quite savage, you know.
- Uh, let's go get 'em.
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- Uh, what's strategy?
A plan of attack. The initial phase is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!
John! Indians! Indians!
Let me in!
Now remember, the Indian is cunning...
- Hey--
- but not intelligent.
Therefore, we simply surround them and take them by surprise--
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.
- Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
- Oh, we don't mind.
That's okay.
- How!
- Uh, h-how, Chief!
- How!
For many moons red man fight paleface Lost Boys.
- Ugh.
- Ugh, ugh.
- Sometime you win.
- Sometime we win.
- Okay, Chief.
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.
""Turn us loose''?
You mean this is only a game?
Sure! When we win, we turn them loose.
- When they win, they turn us loose.
- They turn us loose.
This time, no turn 'em loose.
- Huh?
- Huh?
- The Chief's a great spoofer.
- Me no spoof'em.
Where you hide
Princess Tiger Lily?
- Uh, Tiger Lily?
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've certainly never seen her.
- Me neither.
- Honest we don't.
- Heap big lie.
If Tiger Lily not back by sunset... burn 'em at stake.
Just imagine, real live mermaids.
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Oh, Peter, I'd love to.
All right, come on.
- It's Peter.
- Oh!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello!
Hello, Peter!
- Hello, girls.
- I'm so glad to see you.
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.
Want to hear about the time
I cut off Hook's hand and threw it to the crocodile?
- Oh, I've always liked that one.
- Me too.
Well, there I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...
- Oh, Peter!
- by 40 or 50 pirates.
- Who's she?
Huh? Her?
Oh, that's Wendy.
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?
And in her nightdress too.
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.
- Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
- Oh, but you must!
- We insist!
- No, no, please!
- Too good for us, eh?
- Peter!
- If you dare to come near me again--
- Wendy! Wendy!
They were just having a little fun, weren't you, girls?
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute...
- that I'm going to put up with a--
- Shh. Hold it, Wendy.
- Yep, it's Hook, all right.
- Hook!
- Hook!
Hook! Oh!
Quick, Wendy.
They've captured Tiger Lily.
Looks like they're headin' for Skull Rock.
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.
Now, me dear Princess, this is me proposition.
You tell me the hiding place of Peter Pan... and I shall set you free.
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?
Oh, yes, always, Captain.
You'd better talk, me dear, for soon the tide will be in... and then it will be too late.
- I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun.
- ""Fun''?
Remember... there is no path through water... to the happy hunting ground.
This is your last chance,
Tiger Lily!
Manatoa, great spirit of mighty seawater, speak!
Beware, Captain Hook!
Beware! Beware!
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, Captain.
Stand by, Smee, while I take a look around.
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?
Psst! Wendy. Watch this.
- Mr Smee!
- Uh, yes, Captain?
Release the princess and take her back to her people.
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess--
- But-- But, Captain--
- Those are me orders, Mr Smee!
Aye, aye, sir.
- Well, at last Captain Hook's comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!
I told him all along you Indians wouldn't betray Peter Pan.
And just what do you think you are doing, Mr Smee?
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.
- My orders?
- Why, yes, Captain.
Didn't you just say to go--
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!
- My orders. Of all the bumbling--
- Mr Smee!
Just exactly what do you think you are doing?
Putting her back like you said, Captain.
I said nothing of the sort!
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that--
For the last time, Mr Smee.
Take the princess back to her people.
Understand? Understand?
Understand? Understand?
- Uh, aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and one more thing.
When you return to the ship, tell the whole crew... to help themselves to me best rum.
- Peter!
- Here's your spirit, Smee!
Why, it's Peter Pan.
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, Captain.
Come down, boy, if you've a taste for cold steel.
- Watch this, Wendy.
- Oh, Peter, do be careful.
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!
Right here, Mr Smee.
Hold it, you fool!
No! No!
Captain?
Oh, how dreadful.
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.
Captain!
In the back, Captain?
Give it to him, Captain!
Cleave him to the brisket.
I've got you this time, Pan.
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.
I'll get you for this, Pan, if it's the last thing I do!
I say, Captain, do you hear something?
No.
No!
No!
Mr Crocodile, do you like codfish?
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!
No!
- Smee!
- D-Don't go away, Captain!
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.
Smee!
Smee!
Smee!
Ow!
Captain! Captain!
Smee! Smee!
- Give him back!
- Smee--
Row for the ship!
Row for the ship--
Whoa!
Smee!
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?
Tiger Lily?
Oh, Tiger Lily.
Help--
Peter. Wait for me.
That cursed Peter Pan.
Making a fool out of me.
Oh, my head.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
- Your hot water, Mr Smee.
- Shh!
The poor Captain has a splitting headache.
We mustn't annoy him.
Well, Captain, it's nice to see you smiling again.
Brings back the good old days when we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain... why don't we put to sea again?
You know, there's trouble brewin' on the island.
Women trouble.
I wouldn't want this to go any farther, but... the cook told me that the first mate told him... that he heard that Pan has banished Tinker Bell.
Whoa!
Why, you doddering imbecile, I--
Did you say Pan... has banished Tinker Bell?
Aye, aye, Captain.
That he has.
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, Captain.
This ain't no place for a respectable pirate.
That's it, Smee!
That's it!
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.
Quick, me coat.
Me best dress coat.
Aye, aye, sir. The sooner we get going, the better.
Ah, yes, a jealous female can be tricked into anything.
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Your Sunday set, sir.
If we impress the pixie, convince her we're eager to help her... the wench may chart our course to a... certain hiding place.
Our best hiding place is the Spanish main, sir.
I'll set our course--
And where do you think you are going?
T-To tell the boys we sails with the tide, sir.
You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell... and bring her to me.
Understand?
Aye, aye, s-s-s-sir.
- How!
- How!
What's the Chief doing,John?
He's delivering an oration in sign language.
- What's he saying?
- He says...
""Peter Pan, mighty warrior.
""Save Tiger Lily.
Make big Chief heap glad.''
Well, he certainly doesn't look ""heap glad.''
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.
You now Little Flying Eagle.
- Hurray for Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle!
- Hurray!
Hurray!
- Oh, how wonderful!
- Hurray!
Teach 'em paleface brother all about red man.
Good, this should be most enlightening.
Uh, what makes the red man red?
- When did he first say, ""Ugh''?
- First say, ""Ugh''?
Why does he ask you, ""How''?
""Why does he ask you, 'How'?''
Hana mana ganda
Why does he ask you, how

- Squaw, get 'em firewood.
Squaw no get 'em firewood!
Squaw go home.
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell... but Captain Hook would like a word with ya.
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.
Tomorrow I leave the island, never to return.
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and--
And that's why I asked you over, me dear... to tell Peter
I bear him no ill will.
Oh, Pan has his faults, to be sure.
Uh, bringing that Wendy to the island, for instance.
Dangerous business, that.
Why, rumour has it that already she has come between you and Peter.
But what's this?
Tears?
Then it is true.
Oh, Smee.
The way of a man with a maid.
Taking the best years of her life and then... casting her aside like an old glove!
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear.
It's that Wendy who's to blame.
Mr Smee, we must save the lad from himself.
But how?
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.
Sail! That's it, Smee!
- We'll shanghai Wendy.
- ""Shanghai Wendy,'' Captain?
Take her to sea with us.
With her gone, Peter will soon forget this mad infatuation.
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home--
But, Captain, we-- we don't know where Peter Pan lives!
Great Scott, you're right, Smee!
What's that, my dear?
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.
- Take this down, Smee.
- ""Take this down, Smee.''
Aye, aye, Captain.
- Start at Pegleg Point.
- ""Start at Pegleg Point.''
- Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
- ""Blindman's Bluff.''
Yes, yes. Hop, skip and a jump across Crocodile Creek.
Then north by northeast, one, two, three.
Well, get on with it--
Continue, my dear.
I mustn't harm Peter?
Madam, Captain Hook gives his word... not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
Ah, Hangman's Tree.
So that's the entrance to his hiding place.
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

Big Chief Flying Eagle greets his braves.
- How!
- Uh, how, Chief.
- How, Chief! How!
- How.
- How.
Big Chief greets Little Mother.
- How!
- Ugh!
Aw, Wendy, is that all you have to say?
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.
- Tiger Lily?
-John! Michael!
Take off that war paint and get ready for bed.
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.
Go for days without sleep.
- But, boys, we're going home in the morning.
- Home!
- And--
- Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.
Now, Peter, let's stop pretending and be practical.
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.
Do you want to stay here and grow up like-- like savages?
- Of course.
- But you can't.
You need a mother.
We all do.
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?
Why, Michael, of course not!
Surely you haven't forgotten our real mother!
Did she have silky ears and wear a fur coat?
Oh, no, Michael.
That was Nana.
I think I had a mother once.
- What was she like?
- What was she like?
- I forget.
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!
Hey, who ya shovin'?
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.
Well, a mother, a real mother... is the most wonderful person in the world.
She's the angel voice... that bids you good night... kisses your cheek... whispers, ""Sleep tight.''
Your mother
And mine
Your mother
And mine
The helping hand that guides you along
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Your mother
And mine
Your mother
And mine
What makes mothers all that they are
Might as well ask what makes a star
Ask your heart to tell you her worth
Your heart will say
Heaven on earth
- Another word
- Shh.
For divine
Your mother
And mine
- I wanna see my mother.
- Yes, Michael.
I propose we leave for home at once.
- Could I go too? Huh, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!
- Come on! Let me go!
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.
Uh, that is, if Peter doesn't mind.
Go on!
Go back and grow up!
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up... you can never come back!
- Never!
- Dear.
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.
They'll be back.
Peter.
Goodbye, Peter.
All right, men.
Take them away.
And now, Smee, to take care of Master Peter Pan.
But, Captain, wouldn't it be more humane-like to slit his throat?
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.
But I have given me word not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
And Captain Hook never breaks a promise.
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho
So try the life of a thief
Just sample the life of a crook
There isn't a boy who won't enjoy

Join up with Captain Hook
- Hey, I wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!
Boys! Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
But Captain Hook is most insistent, Wendy.
Yeah! He says we'll walk the plank if we don't.
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.
Peter Pan will save them.
Oh, Captain, you did it.
But a thousand pardons, my dear.
I don't believe you are in on our little joke.
You see, we left a present for Peter.
Sort of a surprise package, you might say.
Why, I can see our little friend at this very moment... reading the tender inscription.
""To Peter, with love from Wendy.
Do not open till 6 o'clock.''
Huh. I wonder what's in it.
Could he but see within the package... he would find an ingenious little device.
Set, so that when the clock is like this...
Peter Pan will be blasted... out of Never Land forever.
No!
But time grows short.
We have but 1 8 seconds.
Fifteen seconds.
Thirteen seconds.
Twelve seconds.
Well, I guess
I can open it now.
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?
Hook? A bomb?
Don't be ridiculous!
And so passeth a worthy opponent.
Amen.
Hook! It was a bomb!
Why, if it hadn't been for Tink-- Tinker Bell!
Tink? Tinker Bell?
Where are you, Tink?
Tink? Tinker Bell!
Tink. Are you all right?
Wendy? The boys?
But I've gotta save you first.
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?
You mean more to me than anything in this whole world!
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?
Captain Hook, we will never join your crew.
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Be brave,John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Come on!
- Get along over there!
- Get going, miss. Get going!
Don't give us no trouble!
Go on! Go on!
Get it over with!
- Move along!
- The Captain's waitin'!
Wendy! Wendy!
- Captain, n-no splash.
- Not a sound.
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.
- Did you hear a splash?
- I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day.
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.
The ship is bewitched.
No splash, Captain.
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.
I'll give you a splash!
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!
It's his blinkin' ghost what's talkin'!
Say your prayers, Hook.
I'll show you this ghost has blood in his veins.
I'll run him through! Ooh!
Take that!
Curse this hook!
Come on, everybody!
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!
Don't stand there, you bilge rats!
Get those scurvy brats!
After the brats, men!
This is no mere boy.
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!
Steady, men. Steady.
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!
Down, you blackguard!
Hurray!
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!
- Yea for Bear Killer!
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!
Coward? Me?
Ha-ha-ha! You wouldn't dare fight old Hook man-to-man!
You'd fly away like a cowardly sparrow!
Nobody calls Pan a coward and lives!
I'll fight you man-to-man, with one hand behind my back.
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!
Now! Insolent youth, prepare to die!
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!
No! I gave my word.
You're mine, Hook!
Cleave him to the brisket!
You wouldn't do old Hook in now, would you, lad?
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!
- I'm a codfish!
- Hurray!
Hook is a codfish
A codfish, a codfish
-Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish
-All right, Hook... you're free to go, and never return.
Peter!
Smee! Smee!
Smee!
Smee! Smee!
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
Captain!
Captain! Captain!
Hurray!
Hurray for Captain Pan!
All right, ya swabs, aloft with ya!
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!
But, but, Peter--
Oh, that is, Captain Pan.
- At your service, madam.
- Could you tell me, sir, where we're sailing?
- To London, madam.
- Oh, Peter.
Michael!John!
We're going home!
Man the capstan!
Hoist anchor!
Pixie dust!
George, I am so glad you changed your mind about Wendy.
After all, she's still a child.
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.
Do I, Nana?
Oh! Wendy!
Wendy, what on earth are you doing there?
Mmm. Hmm?
- Oh, Mother, we're back!
- Back?
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.
- Lost Bo-- Ready?
- To grow up.
That's why they went back to Never Land.
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.
- Uh, ""am''?
- Uh, ready to grow up.
Oh! Oh! Uh--
Well, my dear, all in good time.
- After all, perhaps we were too--
- Oh, but, Mother... it was such a wonderful adventure.
Tinker Bell and the mermaids and Peter Pan.
Oh, he was the most wonderful of all.
- Why, why, even when we were kidnapped, I--
- Kidnapped!
Mm-hmm. I knew Peter Pan would save us, and he did.
And we all called him a codfish!
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.
And then we sailed away on a ship in the sky.
Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed.
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?
See how well he sails the ship.
- George. George!
- Now what, Mary?
Nana, d-did you see--
You know, I have the strangest feeling... that I've seen that ship before.
A long time ago... when I was very young.
- George, dear.
- Father.
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all thejoy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
1964, a crucial moment in American history...
Lyndon Johnson is re-elected to the presidency by a landslide,
The New York WorlÔs Fair introduces a bright new future.
And after five scintillating years on the air...
Presto!
The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show is abruptly cancelled.
- Cancelled?!
- Cancelled?!
Uh, sorry about that, boys.
A lothas changed in 35 years.
Velcro has replaced the zipper.
Sneakers have lights on them.
The Cold War is over.
And The Rocky and
Bullwinkle Show... is still cancelled.
Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, once the beloved home of Rocky and Bullwinkle, had been a thriving cartoon town.
Nowit was crippled by years of reruns.
The beautiful
Frostbite Falls Forest... decimated.
The once majestic falls above Veronica Lake...
...devastated.
While the narrator... thaùs me... down on his luck and out of a job, was forced to move in with his mother where he was reduced to narrating the events of his own life.
"With the speed and dexterity astonishing in a woman of her advancing years,
Mother bastes the chicken, tosses the salad, and mashes the potatoes."
Oh, sonny, shut up!
Ow!
And in a little house at the top of a stump forest,
Rocky and Bullwinkle themselves, were forced to subsist on ever-diminishing residual checks from reruns of their oldshow.
World famous television stars whose adventures once took them all over the globe, now their exploits were just a memory.
Yes, it was a melancholy time indeed.
Rocky the flying squirrel hadn't flown in years.
Whaùs the point?
I guess the world just doesn't need us anymore, Bullwinkle.
Say, where are you going?
All this exposition is wearing me out.
I'm going for a walk in the woods.
But, Bullwinkle, there aren't any woods anymore.
You don't have to tell me.
I'm the chairman of the Frostbite Falls Society for Wildlife Conversation.
You mean wildlife conservation.
What did I say?
You said,
"wildlife conversation."
Somebody's going to start talking about these things.
Yes, even their wordplay had become hackneyed and cheap.
No, it was always like this.
But times were just as tough half way across the drawing in the former Soviet satellite of Pottsylvania.
Where Rocky and Bullwinkle's archrivals,
Boris and Natasha, and their fearless leader...
Fearless Leader... were cooking up their latest scheme for taking over the world, when their plans were crushed by the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Whaùs going on?
But, while the citizens of Pottsylvania rejoiced in their new found freedom...
Yay!
...Fearless Leaderand his cohorts went underground, where upon they embarked upona terrifying plan, a plan that would take them to a strange new land where the line between cartoon and reality is so thin, thaùs iùs hard to tell one from the other.
A place where with the right special effects, it might just be possible to break through... to the otherside!
It was a beautiful and smoggy day at Phony Pictures Studio, where an ambitious junior executive named Minnie Mogul was busy searching for a hot new script.
Too intelligent.
Too intelligent.
Hello, Minnie.
Holy mackerel!
Who areyou?
Three ofthe most terrifying villains in the history of children's television.
How do you do?
Nice to meetyou.
What do you want?
We were wondering, how would you like toproduce the Rocky andBullwinkle movie?
I'd love to.
I love it.
What is it?
Iùs classic American cartoon from early '60s.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, Minnie... we're stuck in reruns.
You're looking for a project.
Maybe we can help each other out.
This contractgives youallrights to The Rockyand
Bullwinkle Show.
All you have to do is sign right here andyour fiirst producing endeavor is as goodas gold.
Whaùs the matter?
I can't sign a contract that will help three ruthless villains take over the world.
I just can't.
Why not!?
My pen's out ofink.
Use mine.
Okay.
And then through the miracle of computer-generated digital technology...
Minnie reached into the televisionset and signedthe contract.
But when she tried to pull the contractout... the expensive animated characters were instantly converted into evenmore expensive motionpicture stars.
Hey... how did that happen?
We're attached to the project.
But even though thepun was weak, the contract was ironclad.
And the three villains walked out of the studio and into the real world, while Minnie marched straight into the offiice of Phony Pictures' C.E.O.,
P. G. Biggershot.
But unfortunately for her, when she pitched her project to the powerful executive, she ran into an unexpected snag.
I don't like moose pictures.
So while Minnie's motion picture plans were stymied, back in Frostbite Falls,
Bullwinkle got a rare flash of inspiration.
It is kinda hot in here.
I've been inspiring for hours.
- Hey, where areyou going?
- I'm going to the White House, to talk to the president about the trees.
So Rocky and Bullwinkle set off on the road to Washington.
I don't know, Bullwinkle, it looks a little jammed.
Horsefeathers!
How bad could it be?
Rocky:
Look at all the red tape!
Don't worry, little buddy.
I'm sure the president will send for us after all the letters
I wrote him.
Why, I bet any second now... or two... or three... or four... or two... or three... or four...
There the matter seemed destined to rest... until six months later, in Washington, D. C., when idealistic, warm hearted, and beautiful FBI agent,
Karen Sympathy, was summoned to the office of hard-boiled FBI director,
"Cappy" Von Trappment.
Agent Sympathy, given all your bungled assignments in the past,
I suppose you were wondering why I picked you for this mission.
Yes, sir.
Sympathy, allow me to be frank.
Thisjob requires the ideal FBI agent... someone tough, someone hard-bitten, someone emotionless.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir. Tough!
Hard-boiled! Unemotional!
Good.
Are you familiar with
The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show?
Oh-hh!
I mean... ahem...
I've heard of it.
171/2 short minutes later...
Cappy:
Mr. President, this is a regular networkTV station.
Announcer:
PresidentSignoff, standing firm lyin the middle of the road.
But lookwhat happens when we switch to cable...
For the last six months, a cartoon villain from the old
Rocky and Bullwinkle Show named Fearless Leader has been buying up every single hour of cable programming in this country, forming asingle gigantic network called RBTV, or "Really Bad Television."
According to our sources, three days from now
Fearless Leader plans to broadcast TV shows so terrible, they'll turn anyone who watches them into a mindless zombie, incapable of independent thought.
Totally different than regular TV.
The RBTV broadcast starts at noon on Saturday.
By 8:00 that night,
Fearless Leaderwill have hypnotized enough viewers that he can go on the air and make the whole country vote for him as president.
Well... thaùs no good...
No.
No, I mean...
I want to be president again.
Yes.
We all know that, sir.
Can't the Pentagon do something about this?
Any recommendations?
General Foods?
General Store?
General Admission?
We can't think ofanything,
Mr. President.
Can't the FBI do anything, Cappy?
We've already sent three crack agents to infii ltrate
RBTV...
They've disappeared.
Iùs almost as if there were a mole in the White House.
Thaùs just ridiculous.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President, our only chance is to call on those two gallant heroes... who successfully foiled
Fearless Leader's schemes forworld conquest... backwhen he posed a threat in the 1960s.
If anyone can stop him, they can.
Rocky and Bullwinkle!
Rocky and Bullwinkle, sir.
Sympathy, you've got exactly 46 hours... to get Rocky and Bullwinkle to New York and shut down
Fearless Leader's broadcast.
Thank you, sir.
I won't fail.
Just be careful.
We've already lost three ofour best agents.
So good luck.
Oh, sir, just one thing...
How do I get Rocky and
Bullwinkle out ofreruns?
I don't know.
Fearless Leader and those other two got out somehow, didn't they?
Figure it out!
And, Sympathy, remember, we only care about results.
Within the hour, Karen was enroute to LosAngeles.
She was determined to give the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie the green light.
Rocky:
Whaùs happening?
Cobs and shuckins, Rock!
The president must be beaming us to Washington!
Thaùs not the president,
Bullwinkle.
Thaùs agreenlight from Hollywood.
Those TV people musùve changed their minds.
Whoa!
Goodbye, sonny!
Narrator:
I'llbeback forhiatus, Ma!
Bullwinkle:
Hang on, Rocky!
Narrator:
Mama!
Oof!
Hokey smoke!
Areyou all right?
Yeah, but I think we're on the wrong show.
Look how well they drew that girl!
Iùs you.
Iùs really you!
Rocky... and Bull...
Bull...
- Bull...
- I believe the word... you're searching for is "winkle."
Bullwinkle.
Hey, what network areyou from?
I'm not from any network.
Agent Karen Sympathy, FBI.
Listen, you guys.
I've been sent here because...
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get out ofhere fast.
Quick!
Leùs go to a commercial!
What is this,
PBS?
Come on!
Leùs go!
- Hold it right there, lady!
- Just a second!
Er... this way!
Hey, wait for me!
Ow!
Ow!
Bullwinkle, I don't think we're on television anymore.
Bullwinkle, can you rappel?
Sure! I've been repelling viewers foryears!
Never mind.
Get on my back.
I'll carry you down.
What about Rocky?
He's a flying squirrel.
He'll manage.
Er...
Bullwinkle:
Aah!
Ooh!
Hurry up, Rocky!
Fly down!
Just like old times.
Aaah!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Rocky! You okay?
Sure, just out ofpractice.
Moments later...
Agent Sympathy, can I ask you something personal?
Didyou watch ourshow?
Did I watch your show?
I lovedyour show!
- You did?
- Sure!
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted to have adventures like you guys.
Thaùs why
I joined the Bureau.
Rocky and Bullwinkle:
Really?
But that little girl doesn't exist anymore, Rocky.
They don't want her kind in the FBI.
I do exist! I do exist!
Let me out!
- There's something in your eye.
- No, there's not.
Ow!
All right, we need to get to New York and stop Fearless Leader's broadcast within 40 hours.
Rocky:
Waitaminute!
Why don't we take an airplane?
Because then it wouldn't be a road movie. Whee-ee!
Karen:
We don'tknow how, but Fearless
Leader, Boris and Natasha escaped from the cartoon world into the real world.
- So the president sent me to...
- Ofcourse!
The president got my letters about the trees!
What trees?
The Frostbite Falls Forest.
I knew he would respond.
- Look, we don't have time...
- Bullwinkle, this lady isn't here about the trees.
- She's from the FBI.
- FBI?
Didn't they take our show off the air?
- You mean the FCC.
- Didn't they like it either?
Look...
Can you believe we used to get paid for this routine?
Would you listen to me, please?
Finally, in a crisis of conscience,
Karen decided to tell... an untruth.
Okay, you're right.
The president sent me because he wants you to head... the... er...
Committee for Animated
Wildlife Preservation.
Ooh!
Okay?
Thaùs not whatyou said before!
I was building up to it.
Gee, what kind ofmusic is that?
- Hip-hop.
- Okay... but I'd still like to know what kind ofmusic it is.
Thaùs funny, the radio's off.
Oh, thaùs just Bullwinkle.
His antlers pick up everything.
Bullwinkle, cover up your nose!
Okay. I was just gettin' jiggy with it.
They sure don't have music like that in Frostbite Falls.
Agent Sympathy, have things changed a lot in the last 35 years?
Karen:
Just you waitandsee.
Karen:
Just you waitandsee.
As dawn broke over the City ofAngels, our valiant protagonists boldly rocketed toward the beckoning horizon toward the beckoning horizon of a strange new three-dimensional world, and the unimaginable perils that lay on the road ahead.
While on the otherside of the country, at Fearless Leader's headquarters,
Really Bad Television...
Fearless Leader:
My fellow Pottsylvanians, this is the quality control.
It will enhance or degrade the quality of what ever you run through it.
If the input show is bad enough, the quality control will exaggerate its mind-numbing properties... until the audience is completely hypnotized.
So, Badenov, these shows had better be terrible!
Don't worry,
Fearless Leader.
We are ready to test the machine.
Ready to test machine!
Put on your protective glasses!
Put on protective glasses!
Fearless Leader:
Badenov, proceed with the test!
Badenov, proceed with test!
Sometimes, iùs not so easy being Fearless Leader.
Announcer:
Coming toyour TV, brand new exciting shows of the highest fun!
So, if adventure is your best ingredient, try the action with...
Clever Spies Crush the Enemy On Monday!
And the laughter never gets away... with Three Funny and Wacky
Spies & Their Horse,
Who Will Also Be a Spy.
It works!
Yeah!
Silence!
Iùs a message from my mole at the White House!
Moose and squirrel!
Moose and squirrel.
How many times in the past have they stood between me... and my dreams ofglory?
How many times have they foiled my plans... with their bungling interference?
Er... 28?
Quiet, idiot!
They must never reach
New York alive.
I want you to destroy them personally.
After 30 years of waiting, one more chance to crush moose and squirrel!
Oh, Fearless Leader, you are so good to us!
There has never been a way to actually destroy a cartoon character... until now!
What about in that movie,
RogerRabbit?
Shut up!
This is totally different!
There has never been a way to actually destroy a cartoon character... untilnow!
This is the computer degenerating imagery.
Show them, Sydney.
The "computer degenerating imagery" or C.D.I., as I like to call it, is totally user-friendly.
Just index the binary codes of the animated image you're gonna degenerate and the C.D.I. 'll dismantle the digital image on your film stock. 'Kay?
Bring in the test subject!
No, no!
Oh, this is what
I was afraid of.
I've been tricked!
Please, don't send me there.
Please don'tsendme there!
Now I know what happened to my friend Freddy the Ferret and those cute little bunnies...
Okay, now all you gotta do is type in an address and send him where all worthless cyberjunk ends up... the Internet!
Let go of my paw.
You broke my nail!
Aah!
So, thaùs all there is to it.
Here's the manual and she's all yours.
I assumeyou're both computer literate?
We don't need computerweapon to kill moose and squirrel!
We've been trying to kill moose and squirrel for 35 years.
And we've never even come close.
Exactly.
Andso, armed with the C.D.I., and a truck load full of really silly cartoon weaponry,
Boris and Natasha set off to blast Rocky and Bullwinkle from the face of the Earth, and immediately got stuck in traffic.
While back at RBTV...
Dear Diary, soon the presidency will be mine.
As for this FBI agent,
Karen Sympathy,
I will deal with her the same way I dealt... with the three agents before her.
At the moment oftruth, she'll be plugged directly into the quality control current and turned into a helpless... mindless... vegetable.
Vegetable.
...A barrel ofmoney
Maybe we're ragged and funny
Bullwinkle:
But we'll travel along
Rocky:
Singing a song...
Karen:
Youknow, lusedtobe justlikeyouguys.
Cheerful, optimistic.
But if there's one thing
I learned in the FBI, iùs that life is not a cartoon.
Whoa!
Look out!
Whoa!
Aah!
Out ofthe car!
Whaùs the rush?
All right, I'm going,
I'm going!
Are you all right?
Ofcourse.
Guess I should have figured.
Boris:
Butnotforlong!
Hey, Rock.
They look kind offamiliar.
Yeah! Haven't we seen those two somewheres before?
Whaùs with the cannon?
Iùs traditional!
Run!
Karen:
Boris Badenov!
I've seen you on TV.
You're a crooked, creepy, no-good rotten worm.
Oh, thank you.
You're slimy, sneaky, sleazy...
Please! You'll turn my pretty head.
You're asadisticspy anda... and a... really, really bad person!
Stop!
You're embarrassing me.
Where is boom?
Boris, darling, maybe iùs time to update our technique.
Fearless Leader!
We're so happy you called!
Haveyou liquidated moose and squirrel?
Did you use the C.D. I?
Yes?
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
Er...
Then who else are you talking to?
Are you talking to me?
Well, I'm the only one here... soyou must be talking to me... and you are lying!
Now catch moose and squirrel and next time use the C.D.I. On them!
Rocky:
ButKaren, we can'tride to therescuein astolen truck.
Yeah!
Why couldn'tyou steal something with bucket seats?
Bullwinkle!
Just kidding, Rock.
Iùsjust not right.
Iùs not right?
What are you talking about?
They wrecked our car!
They were trying to kill us!
But we're supposed to be the heroes.
Rocky, iùs not 1964 anymore.
You're in the real world now.
Rocky's right, Karen.
And two rights don't make a wrong.
Bullwinkle, thaùs not what you mean.
You mean two rights do make a wrong?
No!
I always thought two rights made a U-turn.
I don't know how much more ofthis I can take.
Well, leùs fii nd out.
Two U-turns make a circle, two circles make a figure eight, two figure eights make a butterfly...
Look, all I want from you guys are results. Okay?
It was their first fight.
Andso, racked with internal conflicts, they made their way across the Great Divide and onto the great plains.
Bullwinkle:
Hey, look at that, Rock!
What a strange looking town!
Andwhile Bullwinkle ponderedthemodern world, severalstates back,
Boris andNatasha... were still tramping along theroad.
Ifonlywe had a helicopter.
Butsince they were in themiddle ofthe desert, there was obviously no chance whatsoever of finding a helicopter.
Boris...
Look!
Oh, damn!
Nevermind.
Natasha, quick.
Natasha:
Whatluck!
Great googly moogly!
Holy cow!
What the?
Hey, listen, gol-darn it!
Thaùs the third time this month.
I'm sick and tired of shopping for helicopters.
Boy, ifl had a missile,
I'd blow your buns right out ofthe sky!
Yes, Boris and Natasha were back in business, but they had no way of discovering the route our heroes had taken...
Hey!
You can'tdo that!
Interstate 1, just outside Red Bait,
Oklahoma, darling.
- Cheaters.
- Thankyou!
And high above our unsuspecting heroes...
Natasha:
- Statepolice?
- Yes, ma'am?
This is FBI Agent
KarenSympathy...
All right,
I'm sorry I yelled.
Butyou don't understand.
I can't mess up this time.
"This time"?
Was there a last time?
Tell us about yourself, Karen.
Leùsjust say
I've made... mistakes.
Look, I can't blow this one.
The whole world depends on it, and I can't do it withoutyour help.
Agent Sympathy, you can count on
Bullwinkle and me.
- We won't letyou down.
- No.
Thanks, you guys.
You know,
I'm glad Cappy picked me for this mission.
I think we're gonna make a great team.
- Huh?
- Oh, no.
And just as this sentimental moment had mercifully come to a close, our heroes were pulled over by two state troopers and a cameraman from the hit TV show, and a cameraman from the hit TV show,
Made Up Stories From the Real Highway Patrol.
Step out of the vehicle with your hands up, please!
Iùs okay, Officers,
I'm with the FBl...
Step out of the vehicle now!
Hey, Rock, your face is all blurry.
So's yours.
This truck matches the description... ofa vehicle reported stolen outside Red Bait, Oklahoma, just a couple ofhours ago.
You are under arrest for grand theft auto and for impersonating
FBI agent, Karen Sympathy.
I am FBI Agent
Karen Sympathy!
Like fun you are.
We both know Agent
Karen Sympathy... has a heavy
Pottsylvanian accent.
We heard her on the radio.
But she really is with the FBI!
Yeah, and I'm really john Goodman.
Leùs get in the car.
Just one minute, Officer!
Wherever she goes, we go.
Yeah, thaùs right.
We're a team!
Well, she's going off to the federal pen... to break rocks for the next fiiveyears.
Okay, well, don't forget to write.
I guess we could always appear atyour trial... as animated character witnesses!
No!
Rocky, Bullwinkle... iùs your duty to get to New York by 8:00 PM tomorrow.
Rocky:
Karen, we can't leaveyounow.
Hey, I'm an FBI agent, remember?
I'll straighten this out, and catch up with you later.
But we've never been in the real world before!
Oh, you'll do great.
I know it.
Hey!
What about our faces?
Oh... sorry.
Wait, you can't just leave them on the side ofthe road like that.
They don't even know where they are.
Don't worry, ma'am.
They're animals.
They'll forage.
Bullwinkle:
C'mon, Rock, time's a-wastin'!
We owe it to Karen to see the president about the trees!
Trees?
Bullwinkle, we have to go to New York.
We don't have time to get to Washington!
This is no time to worry about getting the washing done.
Not "washing done."
Washing-ton!
A ton?!
Well, that is a lot oflaundry.
Bullwinkle, that joke just won't wash!
Well, you can't blame me for drying!
I think I'll fly ahead.
Butit was just no use.
Faced with the utter hopelessness of their predicament, the razor-sharp mind of Bullwinkle quickly formulated a daring plan.
Help! Help!
Somebody please help!
Help!
So on they walked, two lone figures... making their way through a foreign and hostile live-action landscape.
I thought you said we were in Oklahoma.
Would you like to narrate this movie?
No.
And so on they walked, two lone figures... making their way through a foreign and hostile live-action landscape.
They walked until their thumbs ached, but no one wanted to take a chance... ona 6'7" talking moose and a flying squirrel who couldn't fly.
I could f-fly if I had to!
Whoa!
Ow!
Kinda makes you feel discouraged.
Maybe we should be a little more aggressive.
Stop!
This movie's gettin' kind of...
Don't say it!
Two-dimensional.
Yes, things were beginning to look mighty dark... for our intrepid heroes...
It is gettin' kinda hard to see.
Bullwinkle, he means our situation.
Oh!
Wait a minute, boys, there's a couple of headlights.
I think iùs...
Yes! Yes!
It was a couple of fresh-faced college students... named Martin and Lewis.
Come on, Rock!
Iùs a convertible!
All right, buckle up now, fellas.
Yeah, safety fii rst!
So where doyou boys go to school?
We're undergrads at Wossamotta U.
Rocky and Bullwinkle:
Wossamotta U!
My old alma mater!
Bullwinkle was a big football star at Wossamotta U.
- Quarter-buck!
- I thoughtyou looked familiar.
Where are you fellows coming from, anyway?
Thankyou!
We've been on the road, looking for America.
Lewis:
We've been looking forAmerica all day.
Martin:
We just can't find it.
Lewis:
Man, we're exhausted.
Bullwinkle:
Gee, fellas, perhaps you've been looking too hard.
Maybe America is all around you... in a thousand different beautiful manifestations.
Wouldn't you say so, young people?
Yeah, right.
Rocky, haven't we passed this town before?
Following ominously above them in the Midwestern sky,
Boris conceived a sinister plan.
Flying ahead to Wossamotta U... the two villains made asizable donation to the college... in Bullwinkle's name... prompting the college president to bestow upon Bullwinkle... an honorary moosters degree.
And when moose is at podium for acceptance speech,
I'll be on water tower with C.D.I.
There was only one problem...
Wossamotta U. Had no watertower.
Can't even find water fountain.
Their entire scheme seemed to be on the verge ofcollapse, until they hit upon an incredibly ingenious plan...
Together:
What?!
Dawn brokeat 6... 00AM.
The day of Fearless Leader's deadly broadcast... had finally arrived.
And there was Karen, toiling away under the watchful eyes ofa tall, blond, incredibly handsome,
Swedish-American prison guard named Ole.
Several states away, our hitchhiking heroes were doggedly making their way to New York, but little did theyknow they were driving... straight into Boris Badenov's sinister snare.
Heavens to Betsy!
The car is sticking its tongue out at me!
No, iùs not.
Iùsjust a fax.
- A what?
- A fax!
Don't you guys know about faxes?
Yeah, don'tyou know about E-mail?
Sure. A fax is a little red critter... that steals geese and chickens.
Half of them are males and the other half are e-males.
No, iùs a way of transmitting computer-generated information across great distances in the blink of an eye.
Well, I was close.
Lewis:
Oh, hey! Iùs for you.
Hokeysmoke, Bullwinkle!
Wossamotta U. Wants to give you an honorary degree.
And the ceremony is today!
Bullwinkle, we don't have time to go.
We've gotta get to New York!
Oh, woe is me!
I must have my degree!
I'll put it on the wall... for everyone tosee.
I guess if iùs in the name of education...
Oh, it was a happy day at Wossamotta U., scene of Bullwinkle's football triumphs years ago.
Gee, it looks so different.
Everything's in the same place, but...
Well, Wossamotta U.'s been a live-action university since the show went into reruns back in '64.
I thought the buildings looked a lot more realistic.
Say, whereyou guys been all this time, huh?
Reruns.
You know thaùs never gonna happen to us, right?
Well, anyway, there's still a lot... ofanti-cartoon feeling on campus these days.
Hokey smoke,
Bullwinkle!
Iùs some kind of demonstration.
What are the kids protesting these days?
Is it a civil rights march?
Not really...
Is it an anti-war rally?
No, not exactly.
Tell 'em, fellas.
Iùs a anti-moose march.
Yes, itseems that araging controversy had broken out among the students that very morning over the decision to give
Bullwinkle an honorary degree...
Gee, Bullwinkle,
I guess iùs true.
You can't go home again.
Why, Rocky!
Whatever doyou mean?
Wossamotta U. Is home!
Rocky:
Oh, brother!
Look! There's the animated freak now!
My fans!
Bullwinkle, these aren't fans.
This is an angry mob.
Butin the face of danger, our insipid hero... bravely made his way through the angry crowd.
You mean "intrepid hero," don'tyou?
No-oo...
Hundreds of miles away, in RedBait, Oklahoma, it was time for the prisoners' daily helping of disgusting slop.
ButKarenSympathy hadsucceededin making Ole, the simple-minded but incredibly handsome prison guard, fall madly in love with her.
Presently, Karen promisedto let him take her to the movies ifhe would help her break out of jail.
Could we hold hands in the movie theatre?
Of course we could, Ole.
But how would we eat our popcorn?
Well, we could eat our popcorn with one hand... and hold hands with the other.
But what ifl want a soda?
Look...
I'm sure we can work this out.
Good morning, students.
Today Wossamotta U.
Honors one of our own...
As the students vented their collective spleen at Bullwinkle,
RocketJ. Squirrel anxiously surveyed the raging crowd for signs of danger.
And suddenly, his sharp little eyes picked out the terrifying figure of Boris Badenov near the top of the watertower.
Hey! That guy's not a college student!
...that we present this honorary degree... to Bullwinkle J. Moose.
Good morning, children!
Today's lecture is about trees.
Bullwinkle, look out!
Iùs a trap!
ButRocky's voice couldn'tcarry overthestridentshouts ofthestudentbody.
With no alternative in sight,
Rocky tried one more time to summon up those faded aeronautical skills that had once made him a household name.
But just then, Boris managed to turn on the C.D.I.
Aha!
Yes, it looked like curtains for Bullwinkle...
Got to... save...
Bullwinkle!
Rocky:
Whoa!
"Bad command or fii le name.
Press any key to continue."
Which one is "any" key?
Rocky:
Look out!
Oh, no!
With asingle blow,
Rockysent the C.D.I.
Hurtling through thesky... where upon Boris single-mindedly reached out to catch the catapulted computer, forgetting as he did, one vitally important piece of information...
I ain't a cartoon no more.
Aahh!
Darling!
Ow!
Rocky:
Mayday!
You like me!
You really like me!
I guess I've lost the knack.
I'll never fly again.
Yes, without trees, where would the birdies live?
Forced to migrate to the cities, they would take jobs away from local pigeons.
Bullwinkle, they're listening!
Yes, Bullwinkle's speech was soinane... that thestudents couldn'tunderstand a wordhe was saying, andconsequently found nothing to object to.
So RockyandBullwinkle bade a fondfarewell to thehallowedwalls ofWossamotta U.
Don't forget to write, oldbuddy.
Bullwinkle, who are you talking to?
I don't know, but iùs like talking to a wall.
I want to thank you fellas for bringing unity back to this troubled campus with your ludicrous remarks.
Martin and I would like to wish you guys luck against
Fearless Leader.
Yeah, and we would come help you guys, but... we don't wanna get hurt.
Yeah, man, we're not going near him.
Yeah, until we metyou guys, we almost totally lost faith in America.
Lewis:
Youknow, andwe lostfaith in our car.
I used to think our carwas really cool, but now iùsjust always dirty.
And running low on gas.
Yeah, but since we met you guys, we love it again.
Yeah, the car is totally back.
So, as a gesture of our appreciation, we want you guys to have it.
Yeah, so, take the car.
Really?
Iùs yours.
Whoa!
Rocky:
Gee, fellas, thanks.
Yeah, thanks!
You do know how to drive, right?
Please!
What moose can't drive a automobile?
Rocky:
Oh, brother!
Never said I could drive it well.
Andjustas Rockyand
Bullwinkle got back on the road,
Boris and Natasha emerged from the student infiirmary, ready foraction.
Meanwhile, in Cow Tip,
Oklahoma...
Ole, why don't you go get the tickets, and I'll park the truck?
Gosh, Karen!
I've never had so much fun in my whole life.
Iùs like...
Iùs like there was always a little boy trapped... somewhere inside me, and now that I've met you,
I can finally let him out.
Please, two for the love movie.
There you go.
Tack.
Now, thaùs not verynice.
Shut up.
As for Rocky and Bullwinkle, they were gently motoring along an Illinois interstate...
Hey, Rock, there's that same town again!
Areyou sure we're going the right way?
Bullwinkle, look out!
Whoa!
Rocky:
Sorry!
Bullwinkle, we're not going to Chicago!
We are now.
We are now.
As our heroes found themselves racing toward Chicago, little did they realize that only a few miles behind...
And back in Cow Tip,
Oklahoma, the only person in this movie more clueless than Bullwinkle faithfully waited for Karen to get back from parking his truck.
But our heroine was already passing through Indiana... where she was about tomake an ominous discovery.
Announcer:
For watching miserable people suffer in daytime, iùs The Jenny Spy Show.
Are you sorry that you called her fat?
Yes! Yes!
Oh, no!
Not already!
Yes, Fearless Leader's hypnotic broadcast... was already underway.
Announcer:
You are watching premiere broadcast of RBTV.
Ah, I love my RBTV.
Fearless Leader!
The zombombidor shows that 30% of despised, decadent Americans are already total zombies!
Good!
I'll address the nation at exactly 8:00 PM
Eastern standard time.
Back at the RedBait
Prison Farm,
Karen's daring escape had not gone unnoticed.
Meanwhile on the bustling boulevards ofChicago,
Illinois,
Rocky and Bullwinkle were about to discover they had considerable troubles of their own.
There they are!
Motorist #1:
Hello!
Motorist #2:
Look out!
Smush them!
Duck!
Well, mercy me!
Excuse us!
Bullwinkle!
Mamma mia!
Iùs Rocky and Bullwinkle!
And you thought
I couldn't drive.
Bullwinkle!
Look out!
Hold her steady, poopsie.
Is time to say goodbye... to moose and squirrel.
- Ahh!
- Oh, no!
Hasta la vista, baby!
Boris:
Hey, poopsie... whaùs happening?
I think you degenerated wrong special effect.
And while Rocky and Bullwinkle were making their getaway,
Boris and Natasha were still high above the Chicago streets, but with one small difference.
Boris and Natasha:
No helicopter.
And as luck would have it, a travelling mattress salesman just happened to be passing bybelow.
Matresses for sale!
How do I do it?
Volume!
Ouch. Oy.
Now thaùs a soft mattress.
Temporarily outofdanger,
Rocky and Bullwinkle breathed a sigh of relief.
At the same time,
Boris and Natasha were forced to rent... an econoclass Chevy Metro from the Cheapo Rent-A-Car Company in order to resume the chase.
This slight delay gave our heroes the opportunity to effect a not her beautiful, if implausibly coincidental, reunion.
Whoa!
Whoops.
Hey, you lunatic!
Why don'tyou watch whereyou're...
Rocky!
Bullwinkle!
Karen!
Guys, I missed you so much.
I was so worried about you...
I didn't mean to...
I mean...
Good work,
Agents Rocky, Bullwinkle.
Lookit, we have six hours to get to New York.
- The Big Apple!
- Bullwinkle, please!
RBTV is already turning people into zombies.
But Karen, why aren't you injail?
Oh... er...
I was pardoned.
Freeze! Freeze!
Must be some kind of clerical error.
Officer:
You're under arrest.
Keep your hands high above your head!
Andjust to think...
Iùs the opening of moose season.
Iùs the opening of moose season.
Bailiff:
The states of California,
Arizona, NewMexico,
Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Illinois,
Indiana and Ohio, versus KarenSympathy,
Rocket J. Squirrel and BullwinkleJ. Moose.
Judge Cameo presiding.
Who speaks for the defense?
BullwinkleJ. Moose, attorney at law.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
The defendants are charged with grand theft auto:
One count; breaking outofjail... one count, .
Impugning the character of a prison guard...
- Ooh!
- One count... reckless driving:
Four counts; talking to the audience...
- What?!
- Five counts, .
Criminally bad punning:
18 counts.
And three dukes and seven earls!
Make that 19.
Hey! Hey!
Counselor, call your first witness.
Yes, Your Honor.
As our first witness, the defense calls...
Karen Sympathy!
Oh, please, no.
Doyou, Karen Sympathy, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so helpyou God?
I do.
Ha!
A little late!
Oh!
Ms. Sympathy, isn't it true that when our convertible was destroyed in Monument Valley... the first thing you did was to steal... somebody else's truck?
Um...
That depends on how you legally defii ne the word "steal," because I believe...
And didn't you escape from prison... by telling that poor trusting prison guard that you would let him takeyou to the movies?
Well, I thought we might have time ifwe went to a matinee...
Isn't it true you never meant to see a film at all?!
Yes... iùs true.
And didn't you tell
Rocky and me... that you got out of prison because you got a pardon?
Yes...
Yes...
I did do that!
Isn't it true you have no respect for the law or anything else?
No!
I was just trying to complete my mission!
I was only supposed to care about results!
And how come Rocky and me are still cartoons... and Boris and
Natasha aren't?
I don't know!
I didn't write the movie!
I'm only one ofthe characters!
Your witness, Counselor.
What are the teams again?
Bullwinkle, you're supposed to be the defense attorney.
You just proved we're guilty.
Yes, but now our consciences are clean, and the healing can begin.
Your Honor, iùs time the court showed the world that no quarterwill be given to celebrity defendants.
- Celebrity?
- Mm-hmm.
Did you say celebrity?
Where are myglasses?
Oh, my Gawd!
Oh, my Gawd!
Iùs Rocky and Bullwinkle!
Oh, my God!
I love, I loveyour show!
Your Honor!
And you,
Mr. District Attorney,
I'd like to point something out to you in the penal code, section C, paragraph22.
"Celebrities are above the law."
This case is dismissed.
Moments later, our heroes were back on the road, with a mere three hours to get from Rabid Froth, Ohio to New York.
Three hours!
If only we had an airplane.
Hokey smoke!
Look!
Gosh!
Another wild coincidence.
Afternoon, folks.
Together:
Hi!
You got any planes left?
Well, leùsjust kinda give a look-see...
I thinkwe have one left.
They've got tobehere somewhere, Boris, darling!
Keep the change!
Oh! This is gonna get my stepson a new trial.
Boris:
Bingo!
Natasha:
Goody! Goody!
Hey! Hey!
Y'all can't get in there.
She won't hold the weight!
You'll never reach the end ofthe runway.
The wings will come off.
Oh, God!
Oh, crap!
Boris pushed the little Metro for all it was worth...
We've got them, Boris, we've got them!
They've got us, Rocky, they've got us!
But at that very moment,
Boris and Natasha's rental agreement suddenly expired and they were immediately blockaded... by the dedicated agents ofthe
Cheapo Rent-A-Car Company.
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you can do it!
You old bird!
Come on!
Come on!
Although Boris and Natasha tried feverishly to complete the necessary paperwork...
Look!
It was too late.
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
That certainly was a close one.
Leùs just hope this thing makes it all the way to New York.
Where did we go wrong, Boris?
We tried to blow them up.
We tried to have them arrested.
We tried to degenerate them.
We tried to smush them.
Yes, and we never even came close.
Oh, Boris, what are we doing, darling?
We been trying to catch moose and squirrel... ever since we first got drawn.
We tried to stab them, shoot them, smash them, smush them, crush them, bash them, mash them and they don't even know our names.
I'm tired ofall this, Boris.
I don't want to be spy no more.
Leùs faceit, darling, we suck.
We can never catch moose and squirrel.
Boris... don't you want to have little Boris? Hmmm?
Little Natasha?
Wouldn't it be wonderful?
We could rent cottage by sea of Pottsylvania and teach them how to lie, and cheat and be rotten.
They would be worst children in world!
They'd be monsters.
It would be awful!
We could be so happy.
Telephone.
Hoboy.
Saved by bell!
Well, Badenov, did the C.D.I. Work?
Oh, it... it works all right!
So moose and squirrel are dead, then?
Well, is funny you should ask...
Yes, Fearless Leader!
We killed moose and squirrel!
Excellent!
Wait there for my private jet.
I want you both beside my side for the big broadcast.
- Natasha...
- Yes, darling?
Why did you tell him that?!
Because, Boris!
Moose and squirrel can't reach New York... by 8:00 PM in that little plane.
And what ifthey did?
So what?
How could they stop us now?
Practicallywhole country is zombifiied!
We've won, Boris!
We've won!
Just the way
I planned it!
On their way to New York, our heroes were soon to discover... that old Jeb was right.
She won't pull up, we're too heavy!
Rocky, can you fly Bullwinkle down?
I don't think so,
Karen.
He's a huge moose!
I beg your pardon!
I'm as trim as a young fawn!
You weigh 400 imaginary pounds!
Yeah, but iùs all "mooscle."
Bullwinkle, can you fly an airplane?
What moose can't fly a aeroplane?
Rocky, you'll have to fly me down.
I can't do that, Karen.
I can't fly again!
I've lost the knack.
Bullwinkle, take the controls.
Okay.
Listen to me, Rocky.
- You can do this.
- I can't!
- I knowyou can do this.
- I just can't!
This is everything you taught me since I was a little kid.
All you have to do is believe in...
Rocky:
Karen!
Look out for the sign!
Aaah!
Here goes n-nothing!
Gotyou!
Rocky!
Uh-oh!
Together:
Bullwinkle!
Never said
I could fly it well.
See you in New York!
Hang on, Karen!
Hang on!
If I couldjust...
Rocky!
You're flying!
- You're flying!
- Yes, I am!
I certainly am.
Look at me!
I'm flying!
New York City, here we come!
Yahoo!
Yeah!
What a day, a year, a life it is!
You know
Well, you know you had it coming toyou
Now there's not a lot I can do
Dreamer
A stupid little dreamer
So now you putyour head in your hands, oh, no!
Whoo!
Boris, darling, how can you be so rotten?
When I stop moose and squirrel from saving country,
I don't kid around!
Karen looked upon the brave little squirrel with a new admiration.
However, she couldn't help but wonder, were they too late?
Soaringprecipitously overRockefellerCenter,
Karen and Rocky found the entire city of New York completely zombifiied.
Rocky, whatever you do, don't look at the screen!
Touching down outside RBTV, the daring duo was soon to discover that something else was terribly wrong.
Where's Bullwinkle?
The speech starts any minute!
I knew we shouldn't have lefthim.
Bullwinkle and I have never been apart in 35 years!
Quick, Rock, follow me.
Come, Natasha.
Follow me to Fearless Leader.
Go! Go!
Oh, Fearless Leader!
We're back!
You are so-oo happy to see us!
Well, Fearless Leader, he did it!
Boris Badenov is now offiicial number one killer... ofmoose and squirrel.
Excellent, my faithful minions!
Excellent!
Hail, Pottsylvania!
Hail to the black and the blue!
Hail, Pottsylvania!
Sneaky and crooked,
Through and through...
Down with the good guys,
Up with the boss,
Under the sign of the triple cross! Hey!
Hail, Pottsylvania!
Hail, hail, hail!
Thankyou, Fearless Leader!
Well, no one can stop my broadcast now!
FBI! Freeze!
No one but these chocolate-chewing idiots!
All right, I want anyone in this room... who's a Pottsylvanian spy to putyour hands up now!
That means you, too,
Fearless Leader!
Let me see your hands!
All right,
Agent Sympathy.
We don't want anybody to be hurt, now do we?
And whatever you're holding, drop it!
Gladly.
Don't look, Rocky, iùs a trick.
Iùll turn you into a...
Rocky!
Rocky?
Oh-hh!
Peek-a-boopsie!
Fearless Leader:
Well, Agent Sympathy,
I have waited manyyears to face an enemy
I could respect... and I'm still waiting!
No, that was just a little joke.
But I'm afraid that you and this flying rodent have reached the end of the road.
Now get ready for a taste of
Pottsylvanian hospitability.
Thaùs ability to put you in hospital, darling.
Andso, Rocky and Karen's onlyhope in the whole wide world was BullwinkleJ. Moose.
In other words, they didn'thave aprayer.
For Bullwinkle hadmanaged to miss New York altogether and had flown instead to Washington, D. C.
Gee, New York sure has changed a lot since my day.
They even moved the White House here.
Couldn't fii nd the brakes.
Well, as long as I'm here,
I might as well talk to the president about the trees!
Anybody home?
With onlymoments left before thebroadcast,
Fearless Leader hadreleasedRocky... from thegrip ofzombifiication sohe could... share.
As foryou, my friends, we have planned... something quite special.
We are hooking you directly into the quality control.
As soon as we g olive, the current will pass throughyourbrain and you will be turned intoahelpless, mindless vegetable.
But don't worry... it won'thurt.
At least, I never heard a complaint from the other vegetables.
I think your ecognize your three missing colleagues from the FBI?
Help us! Help!
I'm sorry, Rocky,
I've really done it this time.
Don't worry, Karen, you need the most faith when things look the most hopeless.
Thanks, Rocky.
And, Karen... this is pretty hopeless.
Look, we don't care what you do to us... just leave America alone!
Ah, America...
I'm proud of you, Karen.
Listen,
Fearless Leader:
If there's one thing this plucky squirrel has shown me, iùs that you have to be who you are, no matter how much pressure there is to change!
Yay!
Anddespite this inspiring vindication ofKaren's innerchild,
Fearless Leader was unimpressed.
So Karen, Rocky, andthe entire nation... werepoisedon thebrink ofunimaginableperil.
And there is no one...
I said no one... who can stop me now!
Or, in fact, was there?
Soyou see,
Mr. President, all the trees in
Frostbite Falls are gone.
The birds have no place to put their things.
The children have no place to build their tree house.
I built them a stump house, but they say iùs just not the same.
Please help when you have time.
But Gorka, the horse has swallowed the transmitter!
Not again!
They certainly enjoy theirTV at the White House.
Bullwinkle!
Don't watch!
Bullwinkle!
Oh, no!
Notyou, too!
Not a bad show, eh, Mr. President?
Yes, cheap as itmayseem... anditcertainly does seem cheap...
Bullwinkle's head was so thick that Fearless Leader's mind-numbing programming had absolutely no effect on him whatsoever.
Come here!
At least one thing hasn't changed!
TV's as good as ever!
Bullwinkle, allow me to be frank.
Okay, Frank, allow me to be
Bullwinkle.
I'm Cappy
Von Trappment, FBI.
I thoughtyou said your name was Frank.
- Shut up, Bullwinkle!
- Okay, Frank.
As we speak,
99% ofthe country is slobbering in front ofthe television.
- Whaùs so strange about that?
- Listen to me!
We haven't heard from Karen,
I think she and Rocky... are in terrible danger.
You've got to get to New York!
I thought this was New York.
No, Bullwinkle, thaùs Washington out there!
Thaùs Washington!
Really?
Where's that little white wig he always wears?
Iùs no use.
Fearless Leader's speech starts in less than two minutes.
There's no way anyone could get there in time now.
Oh, butterballs!
If only there were some way of transmitting computer-generated animated characters across great distances in the blink of an eye.
Bullwinkle!
Thaùs it!
It is?
Yes, iùs our only chance!
We're gonna E-mail you to Karen in New York.
Well, okay, but don'tyou think... she'd rather get flowers?
Just shut up and hold on!
- Okay!
- One... two... three!
And squeezing into the scanner drive...
Bullwinkle found himself inside the presidential computer.
Butback atRBTV,
Fearless Leader's deadly countdown hadjustbegun.
And thaùs when Bullwinkle snapped into action.
Look, Frank, solitaire.
I'm sorry, Bullwinkle, we don't have time for that!
With the coolagility ofajungle cat, our heroic moose grabbed the corners of the E-mail envelope and hung on for the ride ofhis life.
Eight, seven, si-i...
While time stood virtually still at RBTV,
Bullwinkle surfed the information super highway onhis way tosave the day.
Look, I'm hangin' four!
S-S-Surf's up, dude!
Hang on, Rocky!
I'm coming!
Bullwinkle found himself inside the RBTV computer...
Five...
Computer:
You've gotmail!
...with only seconds left to spare and no idea how to get out.
Four!
Bullwinkle, hurry up!
Click on something!
- "Mine sweeper"?
- Three...
Print! Print!
Andusing his brain,
Bullwinkle activated the 'print"icon... but was hein time?
One...
Fearless Leader!
My fellow Americans.
Say hello to Fearless Leader!
Hello-oo!
You are tired, America.
You are getting verysleepy.
Your mind is mush.
You need help.
Yes, America, you need me to run your country.
Youreallyneedme!
So vote forme asyourleader!
Vote for Fearless Leader!
We will vote for Fearless Leader.
I will vote for Fearless Leader.
Yes, America, I will bring order to the government.
This country will finally have a president you can respect.
Look, iùs moose!
And no sooner had Bullwinkle emerged from the printer than his might yantlers momentarily jammed the quality control signal, reversing the vegetation process and bringing Karen and Rocky miraculously back to life.
Fearless Leader:
Yes, eversince I was a little sketch growing up in Pottsylvania,
I dreamed of ruling the world.
Fearless Leader, moose is loose!
Get them!
Go! Go!
Now, where were we?
Yes. I always knew
I would rule the world someday.
Thaùs exactly whatl'm going to do.
Ouch!
So vote for Fearless Leader and make a little boy's dream come true.
We will vote for Fearless Leader.
Once I am elected, there will be an end to chaos.
There will be discipline.
Because I'm going to run this country... like a well-oiled machine...
I guess you could call me a neat freak, but we all have our little foibles...
That tingles!
...l'll be the president.
And with a single voice,
America will say...
Aaah!
Come on, Rock!
Wrap it all up!
Okay, Karen!
Bullwinkle, finish the speech!
Ahem...
Good evening, America.
Bullwinkle Moose here, saying...
Forgot my line.
Just tell 'em to turn off the TV and vote for whoever they want.
Turn off yourTV and vote for whoever you want!
And whoever wins the election, replant the forest in Frostbite Falls!
And sure enough, all across America,
RBTV viewers turned off their sets and faced the diffiicult question of who they actually wanted to vote for.
And the moment the machine had been destroyed, the three vegetables from the FBI immediately resumed their human form.
Thanks, Agent Sympathy.
Freed at last from
Fearless Leader's evil grasp, even the Pottsylvanian spies rejoiced.
Well, we won't be needing this anymore.
Yeah!
Oh, that reminds me!
I should E-mail that nice Frank an dthank him for his help.
Bullwinkle, no!
Ooh!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Andso the three villains were launchedup into the Internet, where they wouldbe heardfrom nomore.
Aaaaaugh!
And so it came to pass that the election took place as planned.
Yes, Rocky and Bullwinkle were stars once again.
RBTV changed its name from "Really Bad Television" to "Rocky and Bullwinkle
Television."
Whaùs the difference?
Sir, there's one thing
I still don't understand.
Why did you pick me for this mission?
I mean, I'm clearly not FBI material.
FBI material is what gets thejob done, Ms. Sympathy.
If you needed an agent to work with a cartoon moose and squirrel, who would you send?
Someone tough, hard-boiled and cynical?
Or one ofthose soft, squishy, lovey-dovey, idealistic types?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir...
I think.
Affirmative.
Oh, by the way, good work.
Well, I really want to thank you guys for everything.
And I really...
Well, I really...
I'd really like to say that I thinkwe made a great team.
I'd really like to say... that I think we made a great team.
And if it hadn't been fo ryou,
I never would have learned...
And if it hadn't been for you,
I never would have learned...
That what you believe in when you're young, can still be true when you grow up.
Please don't make me say that.
You gotta say it!
Who is she talking to?
You got me, Rock.
That whatyou believe in when you'reyoung, can still be true when you grow up.
Anyway... thanks for the adventure.
So long.
Where areyou going?
Um... the movies.
Ofcourse!
The movies!
Hi. Um... sorry I'm late.
Oh... thaùs okay.
And as Karen and Ole finally went to the movies, back in Frostbite Falls the president carried out the post-hypnotic suggestion to replant the animated trees.
Mama!
Sonny boy!
Meanwhile, all was well with our heroes.
Rocky was his oldself again...
Aw, I'll never forget our trip to New York to visit
President Washington!
Andso was Bullwinkle.
Yes, glad to be homein their revitalized little town,
Rocky the flying squirrel took a well-deserved joyride through the sunny skies of Frostbite Falls!
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!
When you're feeling like you're...
Out of touch
All alone and lost
And drifting through the night
Just think back toyounger times
And you'll fii nd the light
See the world for a while
Through the eyes ofa child
You will see so much wonder
In your days
All thatyou believed
When you were small
Are still the dreams
That guide us all
The mirror shows you've grown
But reflects the child in you
If you're lookin' out
On stormy skies
And empty fiields
Afraid to give it one more try
See yourself above the clouds
Spread your wings and fly
See the world for a while
Through the eyes of a child
You will see so much wonder
In your days
All that you believed
When you were small
Are still the dreams you carry on lmagine what could be
If you just believed in you
When you were young
Who did you wanna be?
What is stopping you
From that dream?
This is whoyou are
Don't be afraid
The child in you will never fail
The power to believe is yours alone
No one can ever take that child away
See the world for a while
Through the eyes ofa child
You will see so much wonder
In your days
All that you believed
When you were small
Are still the dreams
That guide us all
The mirror shows you've grown
But reflects the child in you lfthere's one thing I could
Say toyou
It would be to try
To makeyour dream come true
You can do almost anything
If youjust believe...
If youjust believe...
If only, only, only
You believe...
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.
Sleep tight, kiddo.
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
All right, Mr Bile, is it?
Uh, my friends call me Phlegm.
Uh-huh. Mr Bile, can you tell me what you did wrong?
- I fell down?
- No, no, before that.
Can anyone tell me
Mr Bile's big mistake?
Anyone?
Let's take a look at the tape.
Here we go.
Uh, right... buh, buh, buh, buh... Ah, there.
See? The door.
You left it wide open.
And leaving the door open is the worst mistake... any employee can make because...
Um, it could let in a draught?
It could let in a child!
Oh, Mr Waternoose!
There's nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child.
A single touch could kill you.
Leave a door open and a child could walk right into this factory... right into the monster world.
I won't go in a kid's room!
You can't make me!
You're going in there because we need this.
Our city is counting on you to collect those children's screams.
Without scream, we have no power.
Yes, it's dangerous work, and that's why
I need you to be at your best.
I need scarers who are confident, tenacious, tough, intimidating.
I need scarers like... like...
James P. Sullivan.
Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's now five after the hour of 6:00 a.m... in the big monster city.
Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees, which is good news for you reptiles... and it looks like it's gonna be a perfect day to maybe, hey, just lie in bed, sleep in... or simply work out that flab that's hanging over the bed!
Get up, Sulley!
I don't believe I ordered a wake-up call, Mikey.
Hey, less talk, more pain, marshmallow boy.
Feel the burn!
You call yourself a monster?
Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.
Oh, the kid's awake!
Okay, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, scary... Kid's asleep!
Twins and a bunk bed!
Ooh, I thought I had you there.
Okay, Sulley, here we go.
You ready? Follow it.
Oh, it's over here. Oh, look over there.
Don't let the kid touch you!
Don't let it touch you!
I don't know, but it's been said
I love scarin'kids in bed
Come on, fight that plaque.
Fight that plaque.
Scary monsters don't have plaque.
118. Do you have 119?
Do I see 120?
- Oh, I don't believe it!
- I'm not even breaking a sweat.
Not you. Look!
The new commercial's on!
The future is bright at Monsters, Incorporated.
- I'm in this one! I'm in this one!
- We're part of your life.
We power your car. We warm your home.
We light your city.
- I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
- Hey, look! Betty!
Carefully matching every child to their ideal monster...
to produce superior scream...
refined into clean, dependable energy.
Every time you turn something on,
Monsters, Incorporated is there.
- I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
- We know the challenge.
The window of innocence is shrinking.
Human kids are harder to scare.
Of course, MI is prepared for the future...
with the top scarers, the best refineries...
and research into new energy techniques.
- Okay, here I come.
- We're working for a better tomorrow today!
We're Monsters, Incorporated!
We're MI, Monsters, Incorporated.
We scare because we care.
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, Mike.
I was on TV!
Ah, did you see me?
I'm a natural!
Hello? I know! Hey, wasn't I great?
Did the whole family see it?
It's your mom.
What can I say? The camera loves me.
I'm telling you, big daddy, you're gonna be seeing this face on TV a lot more often.
Yeah?
Like on Monstropolis's Most Wanted?
You've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade, pal.
- Have a good day, sweetie.
- You too, hon.
- Ooh, okay, Sulley, hop on in.
- Nope. Uh-uh.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going? What are you doing?
- Mikey, there's a scream shortage.
- We're walking.
- Walking?
- Yup.
- No. Hey, no, no. Come on.
- Come on.
- My baby, look... She needs to be driven.
Bye, baby! I... I'll call you!
Hey, genius, y-you wanna know why I bought the car, huh?
- Not really.
- To drive it. You know, like on the street... with the honk-honk and the vroom-vroom and no walking involved.
Give it a rest, will you, butterball?
Come on. You could use the exercise.
I could use the exercise? Look at you.
You-You-You have your own climate.
How many tentacles jump the rope
- Morning, Mike! Morning, Sulley!
- One and two and three
- Hey, morning, kids!
- Hey, kids.
- How you doin'?
- Bye, Mike! Bye, Sulley!
Hey!
Aw, nuts.
- Hey, hey, hey, fellas!
- Hey, Tony!
- Tony!
- Hey, hey! Tony!
- Tony!
I hear somebody's close to breaking the all-time scare record.
Ah, just trying to make sure there's enough scream to go around.
- Hey, on the house!
- Hey, thanks!
Oh, great.
Hey, Ted! Good morning!
See that, Mikey?
Ted's walking to work.
Big deal. Guy takes five steps and he's there.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
- Morning, Sulley.
- Morning, Ricky.
- Hey, it's the Sullster.
- See you on the scare floor, buddy.
- Hey, Marge. Hey, how was jury duty?
- Morning, Sulley!
- Hey!
- Hey, it's still leaning to the left.
- It is not!
- Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Mr Sullivan!
Guys, I told ya... call me Sulley.
- I don't think so.
- We just wanted to wish you good luck today.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.
- Oh. Sorry.
- See you later, fellas.
- Go get 'em, Mr Sullivan.
- Quiet!
- You're making him lose his focus.
- Oh, no. Sorry!
- Shut up!
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you.
Ms Fearmonger is on vacation.
Would you like her voice mail?
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo!
Googley Bear!
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Googley-woogley, you remembered!
- Hey, Sulley-wulley.
- Oh, hey, Celia-weelia.
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
So, uh, are we going anywhere special tonight?
I-I just got us into a little place called, um, Harryhausen's.
Harryhausen's? But it's impossible to get a reservation there.
Not for Googley Bear. I will see you at quittin' time and not a minute later.
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Think romantical thoughts.
You and me
Me and you
Both of us together
- You know, pal, she's the one.
That's it. She is the one.
- I'm happy for you.
Oh, and, uh, thanks for hooking me up with those reservations.
Oh, no problem.
They're under the name "Googley Bear."
Oh, good ide...
You know, that wasn't very funny.
- What the...
- Wazowski!
What do you know? It scares little kids and little monsters.
- I wasn't scared. I have allergies.
- Uh-huh, sure.
- Hey, Randall.
- Save it for the scare floor, will you?
- I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.
Gonna be doing some serious scaring, putting up some big numbers.
Wow, Randall. That's great. That should make it even more humiliating when we break the record first.
Do you hear that?
It's the winds of change.
"You hear it? You hear the winds of ch..." What a creep.
One of these days I am really gonna let you teach that guy a lesson.
Chalooby baby.
Good morning, Roz, my succulent little garden snail.
- And who would we be scaring today?
- Wazowski.
You didn't file your paperwork last night.
Oh, that darn paperwork. Wouldn't it be easier if it all just blew away?
Don't let it happen again.
Yes, well, I'll, uh,
I'll try to be less careless.
I'm watching you, Wazowski.
Always watching.
- Ooh, she's nuts.
- Always!
All scare floors are now active.
Assistants, please report to your stations.
Okay, people,
Eastern Seaboard coming on-line.
We got scarers coming out!
Ooh, they're so awesome!
Hey, may the best monster win.
I plan to.
We are on in seven, six... five, four, three, two...
You're the boss. You're the boss.
You're the big, hairy boss.
Oh, I'm feelin' good today, Mikey!
Yeah!
Oh! That-a-boy, that-a-boy.
Another door comin' right up.
You're still behind, Randall.
You know, maybe I should realign the scream intake valve...
- Just get me another door!
- A door! Yes! Door!
Well, Jerry, what's the damage so far?
We may actually make our quota today, sir.
First time in a month.
- What happened?
- The kid almost touched me.
- She got this close to me.
- She wasn't scared of you?
She was only six!
I could have been dead!
I could have died!
Keep it together, man.
Hey, we got a dead door over here!
- We're coming! Look out!
- Coming! Back away!
Excuse us!
We've lost 58 doors this week, sir.
Oh, kids these days. They just don't get scared like they used to.
Let 'er rip!
- Sir?
- What?
Look.
Attention. We have a new scare leader...
Randall Boggs.
Look at those numbers!
Slumber party.
- Never mind.
- Hey, watch it!
Well, James, that was an impressive display.
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr Waternoose.
Of course, I did learn from the best.
If I don't see a new door at my station in five seconds...
I will personally put you through the shredder!
Hey, Wazowski, nice job.
Those numbers are pretty sweet.
Are they? You know,
I hadn't even noticed.
- And, uh, how is Georgie doin'?
- He's doing great.
I love working with that big guy.
Keep the doors comin', Charlie.
I'm on a roll today.
George and I are like brothers...
23-19! We have a 23-19!
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!
Red alert! Red alert!
George Sanderson, please remain motionless.
- Prepare for decontamination.
- Get it off! Get it off!
Duck and cover, people!
Oh, not the CD A!
- Move! Move! Move!
- Coming through, please. Step aside.
Clear the contaminated area.
- We have a 23-19 in progress.
- Keep the area clear.
- Coming through. Watch your step.
Stand back. Careful.
All clear. Situation is niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.
Okay.
Okay, people, take a break.
We gotta shut down for a half hour and reset the system.
An entire scare floor out of commission.
What else can go wrong?
Oh, what a day.
We're just going through a rough time, sir. Everyone knows you're gonna get us through it.
Tell that to the board of directors.
James, this company has been in my family for three generations.
I would do anything to keep it from going under.
- Well, so would I, sir.
- Well...
- Say, I could use your help with something.
- Anything, sir.
You see, we've hired some new scare recruits, and, frankly, they're... they're, um, uh...
- Inexperienced?
- Oh, they stink!
I thought maybe you might come by tomorrow and, uh, give them a demonstration... show them what it takes to be our top scarer, huh?
I'll start out with the old Waternoose jump-and-growl.
Oh, yes, now, that's my boy!
Let's go, everybody. All doors must be returned. No exceptions!
- Oh, yeah.
- I've never seen anything like you today.
- You were on a roll, my man.
- Another day like this, and that scare record's in the bag.
That's right, baby.
So get this. As if dinner wasn't enough, I'm taking her to a monster truck rally afterwards.
- Nice.
- What's on your agenda?
- I'm gonna head home and work out some more.
- Again?
You know, there's more to life than scaring.
Ooh.
Hey, can I borrow your odorant?
Yeah, I got, uh, Smelly Garbage or Old Dumpster.
- You got, uh, Low Tide?
- No.
- How about Wet Dog?
Yep. Stink it up.
You know, I am so romantic sometimes
I think I should just marry myself.
- Give me a break, Mike.
- What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.
Tonight is about me and Celia.
Ooh, the love boat is about to set sail.
'Cause I gotta tell you, buddy, that face of hers, it just makes my heart go...
Hello, Wazowski.
- Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?
- Well, as a matter of fact...
Then I'm sure you filed your paperwork correctly for once.
Your stunned silence is very reassuring.
Oh, no, my scare reports.
I left them on my desk.
And if I'm not at the restaurant in five minutes, they're gonna give our table away. What am I gonna tell...
- Schmoopsie-poo.
- Hey, Googley Bear. Want to get going?
- Uh, do I ever. It's just that...
- What?
- You know, it... There's a small...
- I don't understand.
- It's just that...
- I-It's just that I forgot about some paperwork I was supposed to file.
Mike was reminding me.
Thanks, buddy.
I was? I mean, I was.
Yeah. I was.
- Oh. Okay. Let's go, then.
- We're going.
On my desk, Sulley.
The pink copies go to Accounting, the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing... and the goldenrod ones go to Roz.
Leave the puce.
Pink copies go to Accounting, the fuchsia ones go to Roz.
No, the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing, the goldenrod ones go to Roz...
Man, I have no idea what puce is.
Oh, that's puce.
Uh, hello! Anyone?
There's a door here.
Hello. Hey.
Psst. Anybody scaring in here?
Hello. Yo.
Kitty!
No, no, stay back!
Hold it, hold it.
Oh, Michael, I've had a lot of birthda...
Well, not a lot of birthdays.
But this is the best birthday ever.
What are you looking at?
Oh, I was just thinking about the first time I laid eye on you, how pretty you looked.
- Stop it.
- Your hair was shorter then.
- I'm thinking about getting it cut.
- No, no, I-I like it this length.
I like everything about you.
Just the other day, someone asked me who I thought the most beautiful monster was in all of Monstropolis.
- Do you know what I said?
- What did you say?
- I said...
- Sulley?
- Sulley?
- No! No, no.
- That's not what I was gonna say! I mean...
- Mike, you're not making sense.
- Sure, he's handsome,
I mean, for like a big, rugged...
- Hi, guys.
What a coincidence running into you here. Uh...
- I'm just gonna order something to go.
- Michael.
- Sulley.
- Uh, I wonder what's good here.
- Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.
- I went back to get your paperwork, and there was a door.
- What?
- A door?
- Randall was in it.
Wait a minute. Randall? That cheater.
He's trying to boost his numbers.
- There's something else.
- What?
- What?
- Look in the bag.
What bag?
- They don't have anything I like here!
So take care, Celia!
- Excuse me, sir.
- Michael, what's going on?
- Celia, please try to understand.
- I have to do something!
- Michael!
- Oh, that's good.
- On three. One, two...
- A kid!
- Boo!
A kid!
There's a kid here!
A human kid!
Googley Bear!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
Please remain calm.
This is not a drill.
78-35 in progress.
Please advise.
- Michael? Michael!
- Celia!
- Please come with me.
- Stop pushing.
- Hey, get your hands off my Schmoopsie-poo!
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.
Well, I don't think that date could've gone any worse.
If witnesses are to be believed, there has been a child security breach...
for the first time in monster history.
We can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight.
Well, a kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision.
I tried to run from it, but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll.
It's true!
I saw the whole thing!
It is my professional opinion...
that now is the time to panic.
Oh, it's coming! It's coming!
Boo!
Come here, kid!
No, don't touch those, you little...
Now, those were alphabetized.
It's okay. It's all right.
As long as it doesn't come near us, we're gonna be okay.
Oh, y-you like this? Fetch!
Hey, hey, that's it!
No one touches little Mikey.
Mike, give her the bear.
Oh, no.
Make it stop, Sulley!
Make it stop!
Here, look. Here, see the bear?
Here. Ooh, nice bear.
Sulley!
Ooh, bear! Ooh!
Ooh, he's a happy bear!
And he's not crying, and neither should you, or we'll be in trouble
'cause they're gonna find us.
So please stop crying right now.
- Good. Good, Sulley.
Keep it up. You're doing great.
- I'm a happy bear, yeah.
- Oh, she touched me! It touched me!
- Sulley, the bear!
The bear! Give me the...
What was that?
I have no idea, but it would be really great if it didn't do it again.
How could I do this?
How could I be so stupid?
- This could destroy the company.
- The company?
Who cares about the company?
What about us?
That thing is a killing machine!
I bet it's just waiting for us to fall asleep, and then wham!
Oh, we're easy prey, my friend.
Easy prey. We're sitting targets.
Okay, look,
I think I have a plan here.
Using mainly spoons, we dig a tunnel under the city... and release it into the wild.
Spoons.
That's it. I'm out of ideas.
We're closed.
Hot air balloon? Too expensive.
Giant slingshot? Too conspicuous.
Enormous wooden horse? Too Greek.
No plan. I can't think.
Can't think. Flatlining.
- Flatlining.
- Uh, Mike, I think she's getting tired.
Well, then why don't you find someplace for it to sleep... while I think of a plan!
Are you sleepy? You want to sleep?
Is that what you want?
Okay. All right. I'm making a nice little area for you to...
No. Hey, hey. That's my bed.
You're gonna get your germs all over it.
Fine. My chair's more comfortable anyway.
What?
It's just a closet.
Will you go to sleep?
Hey, that looks like Randall.
Randall's your monster.
You think he's gonna come through the closet and scare you.
Oh, boy. How do I explain this?
Uh, it's empty.
See?
No monster in here.
Well, now there is, but, uh, l-I'm not gonna scare you.
I'm off duty.
Okay. How about I sit here until you fall asleep?
Go ahead. Uh, go to sleep. Now.
Now. Go.
Uh, you go... to sleep.
Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy, but I don't think that kid's dangerous.
Really?
Well, in that case let's keep it.
- I always wanted a pet that could kill me!
- Now, look.
- What if we just put her back in her door?
- What?
Mike, think about it. If we send her back, it's like it never happened.
- Everything goes back to normal.
- Is that a joke? Tell me you're joking.
Sulley, I'd like to think that given the circumstances...
I've been extremely forgiving up to now, but that is a horrible idea.
What are we gonna do, march right out into public with that thing?
Then we just waltz right up to the factory, right?
I can't believe we are waltzing right up to the factory.
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights and some chair fabric are not gonna fool anyone.
Just think about a few names, will ya? Loch Ness, Bigfoot, the Abominable Snowman.
They all got one thing in common, pal: Banishment.
- We could be next!
- Don't panic. We can do this.
- Hey, how you doin', Frank?
- Hey, guys.
Everything's going to be okay.
- Number One wants this place dusted for prints.
- Careful with that.
- I got a good view from here.
- A little lower.
This was recovered at the scene.
- Don't panic. Don't panic.
- Don't tell me not to panic.
- Just keep it together. Stay cool.
- Everything is not okay. It's not okay.
- Boo!
- Could be contaminated.
- Gentlemen, safety is our number-one concern.
- Now, if there's anything that...
- Boo.
- No, not now, not now, and...
Oh, hello, little one.
Where did you come from?
- Mr Waternoose!
- Ah, James, is this one yours?
Uh, actually, that's my, uh, cousin's sister's, uh, daughter, sir.
Yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh,
Bring An Obscure Relative To Work Day.
Must've missed the memo.
Well, listen, James, why don't you stop by the simulator after lunch today... and give us that scare demonstration we talked about, huh?
- Yeah...
Oh! Oh, sir, uh, today might be...
- Excuse me, Mr Waternoose.
Yes, yes, I'm coming. All right, then.
I'll see you this afternoon, James.
That is, if these gentlemen haven't shut us down.
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, a scare demo. Well, that is great.
Why am I the last to know?
We can bring your cousin's sister's daughter along. She'll be a big hit.
Halt! Stop him!
Hold him down.
Come on. The coast is clear. Okay, all we have to do is get rid of that thing.
So wait here while
I get its card key.
But she can't stay here.
This is the men's room.
That is the weirdest thing you have ever said. It's fine. It's okay.
Look, it loves it here.
It's dancing with joy.
I'll be right back with its door key.
That's a cute little dance you've got.
That almost looks like you gotta...
Uh, are you done in there?
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, you finished now, right?
Hello.
Boo!
Where did she go?
Did she disappear?
Did she turn invisible?
I just have no idea.
- Gotcha!
- Boo!
Hey, you're good.
Be relaxed, be relaxed, be relaxed.
Roz, my tender, oozing blossom, you're looking fabulous today.
Is that a new haircut? Come on, tell me.
It's a new haircut, isn't it?
It's got to be a new haircut.
New make-up. You've had a lift, you've had a tuck, you've had something.
Something has been inserted in your skin that makes you look like...
Listen, I need a favour.
Randall was working late last night out on the scare floor.
I really need the key for the door he was using.
Well, isn't that nice?
But guess what. You didn't turn in your paperwork last night.
- He didn't... I... No p-paperwork?
- This office is now closed.
Ready or not, here I come.
I'm getting warmer. Any second now.
Fee, fi, fo...
- What are you doing?
- I-I'm-I'm looking for the kid.
- You lost it?
- No, no. She was just, uh...
Here she is...
Hey, what's the matter?
- Look, I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.
- All right. Carry on.
Randall, thank goodness!
What are we gonna do about the child?
Will you... shh!
The front page! It's on the front page.
The child, the one you were after!
Will you be quiet? Don't you think
I'm aware of the situation?
I was up all night trying to find it.
I-I did a simple calculation, factoring in the size of the sushi restaurant.
The child may have escaped!
Yeah, well, until we know for sure, we're gonna act like nothing happened, understand?
You just get the machine up and running.
I'll take care of the kid.
And when I find whoever let it out, they're dead!
- Why are you still here?
Come on, go! Move! Now!
- Oh. Yes, go, go, go!
Now, now, now, now!
I'm not here!
They're gone.
This is bad.
This is so very bad.
- What were they talking about, a machine?
- Who cares?
Look, don't panic.
All we have to do is call her door down and send her home.
You're right. You're right.
We're just two regular Joes on our way to work. We will blend right in.
- Top of the mornin', fellas.
- Hey, what's shakin', bacon?
Did you lose weight?
Or a limb?
- You have her card key, right?
- Of course I have her card key.
I told you I'd get her card key.
I went and got her card key, and now I have her card key.
Okay, here we go.
Take care of yourself.
Try not to run through any more closets.
- Mike, that's not her door.
- What are you talking about?
Of course it's her door. It's her door.
- No, her door was white.
- No.
- And it had flowers on it.
No. It must have been dark last night, because this is its door.
Hey, you hear that? Sounds like fun in there. Okay, send me a postcard, kid.
That's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 "Mike
Wazowski, You Got Your Life Back" Lane.
Very good. Now, bon voyage.
Bye-bye! Come on!
Look at the stick. See the stick?
Go get the stick. Go fetch.
- Mike, this isn't Boo's door.
- Boo? What's Boo?
That's what I decided to call her.
Is there a problem?
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.
Once you name it, you start getting attached to it.
Now, put that thing back where it came from, or so help me...
Oh, hey, we're rehearsing a-a scene for the upcoming company play called, uh...
Put That Thing Back Where It Came From,
Or So Help Me.
It's a musical. Yeah.
Put that thing back where it came from or so help me
So help me, so help me
And cut!
We're still working on it. It's a work in progress, but, hey, we need ushers.
Sulley, I've had enough.
Now say goodbye to...
- Where'd it go? What'd you do with it?
- Where is she?
- I don't believe it.
She got away from you again?
- Boo!
Well, that is just... Wait a minute.
The sun is coming up.
This is perfect. She's gone!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going? Sulley, please.
Don't blow this, not when we're so close to breaking the record!
Come on, somebody else will find the kid.
It'll be their problem, not ours.
She's out of our hair!
- What are you two doing?
- They're rehearsing a play.
- She's out of our hair
- Can it, Wazowski.
So what do you think of that kid getting out, Sullivan? Pretty crazy, huh?
Oh, yeah. Crazy.
Word on the street is the kid's been traced back to this factory.
- You haven't seen anything, have you?
- Uh, well, uh...
No. No way.
But if it was an inside job, uh, I-I'd put my money on Waxford.
- Waxford?
- Yeah, the one on station six.
You know, he's got them shifty eyes.
- Hey, Waxford!
- Sulley!
Michael Wazowski!
Last night was one of the worst nights of my entire life, bar none.
- I thought you cared about me.
- Honey, please, Schmoopsie.
- I thought you liked sushi.
- Sushi? Sushi?
- You think this is about sushi?
- Schmoopsie!
- Wazowski!
- Michael! Mi... Men!
Breathe. Keep breathing.
- Where's the kid?
- Kid? What kid?
- It's here in the factory, isn't it?
- You're not pinning this on me.
It never would've gotten out if you hadn't been cheating last night.
Cheating?
Cheating. Right.
Okay, I think I know how to make this all go away.
What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?
- Uh, I get a timeout?
- Everyone goes to lunch.
Which means the scare floor will be...
- Painted?
- Empty!
It'll be empty, you idiot!
You see that clock?
When the big hand is pointing up and the little hand is pointing up... the kid's door will be in my station.
But when the big hand points down... the door will be gone.
You have until then to put the kid back.
Get the picture?
Boo! No!
- Hey, you! Halt! He's the one.
- Uh...
- The one from the commercial.
- Affirmative. That's him.
- Can we get an autograph?
- Ohh! Oh, sure. No problem.
If you could make that out to Stephanie, my daughter.
Yes. Let's see.
From your scary friend, best wishes.
So I said, "If you talk to me like that again, we're through!"
- What'd she say?
- You know my mom.
She sent me to my room.
- See you guys later. Take it easy.
- Thanks a lot.
- Bottoms up.
Boo!
Hey.
Oh! Well, hello there.
What's your name?
Mike Wazowski!
Sulley! Oh! Sulley.
Okay, Sulley, come on, come on.
- Hey, you guys seen Sulley anywhere?
- Nope. Sorry.
- Oh, Sulley!
- Boy, Wazowski looks like he's in trouble.
- 23-19! We have a 23-19!
- Halt!
- Oh, dear.
- Get him!
Sulley! Sulley!
Sulley! Oh! Great news, pal!
I got us a way out of this mess, but we gotta hurry. Where is it?
Sull, that's a cube of garbage.
I-I can still hear her little voice.
- Mike Wazowski!
- Hey, I can hear her too.
- Mike Wazowski!
- Mike Wazowski!
- How many kids you got in there?
- Mike Wazowski!
- Mike Wazowski!
- Kitty!
- Boo!
Boo, are you all right?
I was so worried! I was...
Don't you ever run away from me again, young lady.
Oh, but I'm so glad you're safe.
Oh, my, what an affectionate father.
Uh, actually, she's my, uh, my cousin's sister's...
- Okay, Sulley, that's enough. Let's go.
- Mike Wazowski!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Step aside, kid. We're in a...
- Will you stop making Boo laugh!
- I didn't! Come on!
- I still don't understand.
You got Boo's door?
- I'll explain later. Run.
Okay, let's move, let's move, let's move. Come on. Oh, please be there, please be there, please be there.
- There it is, just like Randall said.
- Randall? Wait a minute. Whoa. Hey.
1-2-3-4, get the kid back through the door.
- Hey. Hey.
- We're gonna get our lives back.
The nightmare is over!
- Hey, it's okay, Boo.
- Hey, what's the matter?
Come on, it's time to move!
Mike, what are you thinking?
We can't trust Randall. He's after Boo.
- Who cares? Let's go.
This is a limited-time offer.
- No, no. I don't like this.
Look, Sulley, you wanted her door, and there it is. Now let's move.
- No, Mike.
- You want me to prove everything's on the up-and-up? Fine.
- He wants the door, I get the door.
He don't want the door.
- Mike, wait.
He's a paranoid, delusional fur ball.
Mike!
Hey, Sulley, where you been all day?
Sulley? Sulley?
Huh? Mike.
Mike.
Where are you?
Are you in there?
Where are you, buddy?
Mike, where are you?
Boo, way to go!
It's okay.
Oh, Randall, did you take care of that situation?
Yeah, of course I did. Let's get going.
We gotta make up for lost time.
- You got the extra scream cans?
- Uh, right.
- So to confirm, then, you did find the...
- Yes, I got the kid!
Oh, huzzah! That's great news!
- Not that I was concerned, of course. I knew that...
- Just get over here and help me.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
While we're young here, Fungus.
Kid needs to take off a few pounds.
Wazowski! Where is it, you little one-eyed cretin?
Okay, first of all, it's cretin.
If you're gonna threaten me, do it properly.
Second of all, you're nuts if you think kidnapping me is gonna help you cheat your way to the top.
You still think this is about that stupid scare record?
Well, I did, right up until you chuckled like that.
And, uh, now I'm thinkin'
I should just get out of here.
I am about to revolutionize the scaring industry, and when I do... even the great James P. Sullivan is gonna be working for me.
Well, somebody's certainly been a busy bee.
First I need to know where the kid is, and you're gonna tell me.
- Yeah, I don't know anything.
- Uh-huh. Sure.
I-I don't. I mean, I don't.
Uh-oh. What's that? Wait.
Come on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh! Oh, come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey!
This thing is moving.
I don't like big moving things that are moving towards me.
No, come on. Hey! Randall!
Say hello to the Scream Extractor.
Hello.
Come on. Where you going? We-We'll talk.
Come on, we'll have a latte.
Come on! We can talk about this.
What's that thing? What is that thing?
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no!
Oh! No, come on, guys!
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh, for...
What did you do wrong this time?
- I-I don't know.
I calibrated the drive...
- Go check the machine!
Th-There must be something wrong with the scream intake valve.
Yeah, th-that's the problem with these 32-50 units, boss.
See, the old intake valve is always the first thing to go.
I-I told them this.
Psst. Fungus. Fungus.
You like cars, huh?
'Cause I got a really nice car.
You let me go,
I'll give you a ride in the car.
- Please, Fungus?
- I'm sorry, Wazowski.
But Randall said
I'm not allowed to fraternize with victims of his evil plot.
What happened?
Where's Wazowski?
Where is he?
- Come on.
- This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.
- Careful with that.
Could be contaminated.
- We gotta get out of here now!
We can start a whole new life somewhere far away.
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.
Goodbye, Mr Waternoose.
- No, Mike. Wait.
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Follow me. I have an idea.
- No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
- No, no, no, no, no.
What was that? You're trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.
I was going for a snake-slash-ninja approach with a little hissing.
Oh, how many times do I have to tell you?
It's all about presence, about how you enter the room.
- Mr Waternoose!
- James. Perfect timing.
- No, no, no, sir, you don't understand.
- Ah, now, show these monsters how it's done.
- What? No, no. I ca... I ca... Sir. Sir!
- You have to listen to me.
- Pay attention, everyone.
- You're about to see the best in the business.
- Sir, I c...
- Reset the simulator.
- But, but, sir...
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.
- Sleep tight, kiddo.
- Kitty!
- No, Boo. No, no!
- Now, give us a big, loud roar.
- Mr Waternoose, there's no time for this.
- Come on, come on.
What are you waiting for? Roar!
- B-B-But, sir...
- Roar!
- Ohh.
- Well done. Well done, James.
- Boo?
- All right, gentlemen.
- Right this way, everyone.
- I hope you've learned a valuable lesson in scaring today.
Boo?
Boo?
Boo, it's me.
- The child!
- Sir, she isn't toxic.
- What?
- I know it sounds crazy, but trust me.
- Sulley...
- Boo? No, no, no, no, it's okay.
I was just...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, don't be scared.
That wasn't real. It's just a...
I was just...
- Boo.
- And he was gonna test it out on that sweet little girl.
- Boo?
- Now that we have her, he is trying to kill us.
- This whole thing is Randall's fault.
- Randall?
Yes, and we can take you to his secret lab which is right here in this factory.
How could this happen?
How could this happen?
- Does anyone else know about this?
- No, sir.
Good. This company can't afford any more bad publicity.
Now, before we do anything else... let's take care of the child.
Oh, I never thought things would come to this. Not in my factory.
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this, especially you, James.
But now we can set everything straight again for the good of the company.
- Uh, sir, that's not her door.
- I know, I know.
It's yours.
No!
Boo!
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no!
It's too late! We're banished, genius.
We're in the human world!
Oh, what a great idea, going to your old pal Waternoose.
Too bad he was in on the whole thing!
All you had to do was listen to me, just once!
But you didn't, did you?
You're still not listening!
Take that!
Welcome to the Himalayas!
Abominable! Can you believe that?
Do I look abominable to you?
Why can't they call me the Adorable
Snowman or, or the Agreeable Snowman, for crying out loud?
I'm a nice guy. Snow cone?
No, no, no, don't worry.
It's lemon.
Uh, how 'bout you, big fella?
Snow cone?
Did you see the way she looked at me?
Ah, poor guy. I understand.
It ain't easy being banished.
Uh, take my buddy Bigfoot.
When he was banished, he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.
Wore it on his head like a tiara.
Called himself King Itchy.
It won't be so hard for you guys though, you know. I mean, how lucky can you get?
- Banished with your best friend.
- He is not my friend.
Oh. I-I just assumed you were buddies, you know, when I saw you out there in the snow hugging and all, I...
Look at that big jerk. Ruined my life, and for what? A stupid kid!
Because of you, I am now stuck in this frozen wasteland!
Wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland.
I mean, how about all this fabulous snow, huh?
Oh, and wait till you see the local village. Cutest thing in the world.
I haven't even mentioned all the free yak's milk.
- Wait. What did you say?
- Uh, yak's milk.
Milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic... but, you know, once you pick the hairs out, it's very nutritious.
No, no, something about a village.
Where? Are there kids in it?
Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids, kids who climb on rocks.
- Where is it?
- Ah, hey, hey!
It's at the bottom of the mountain.
- Around a three-day hike.
- Oh! Three days?
We need to get there now!
You want to go to the village?
Okay, rule number one out here.
Always... No.
Never go out in a blizzard.
We need to get to Boo.
Boo? What about us?
Ever since that kid came in, you've ignored everything I've said.
And now look where we are!
Oh, we were about to break the record, Sulley.
- We would have had it made.
- None of that matters now.
None of it matters?
W-W-Wait a second.
None of it matters?
Okay, that's, uh... No. Good. Great.
So now the truth comes out, doesn't it?
Oh, would you look at that?
We're out of snow cones.
Uh, let me just go outside and make some more.
Sulley, what about everything we ever worked for?
Does that matter, huh?
What about Celia?
I am never... never gonna see her again.
Doesn't that matter?
And what about me?
I'm your pal.
I'm-I'm-I'm your best friend.
Don't I matter?
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
But Boo's in trouble.
I think there might be a way to save her if we can just get down to that...
We? Whoa, whoa, whoa. We?
No, there's no "we" this time, pal.
I-If-If-If you want to go out there and freeze to death... you be my guest... because you're on your own.
Hey, I got more snow cones!
Oh, come on now, George.
I know you can do this.
I picked out an easy door for you in Nepal.
Nice, quiet Nepal.
You know, you're right.
Here, take this.
- Go get 'em, Georgie!
- Gangway! Look out! Comin' through!
- Sorry, George.
- What the...
- Hey, you can't just...
Twenty-three-nine...
- Out of the way!
- Hey!
Help!
Finally. I never should have trusted you with this.
Because of you,
I had to banish my top scarer.
Ah, with this machine, we won't need scarers.
Besides, Sullivan got what he deserved.
Sullivan was twice the scarer you will ever be.
Kitty!
- Kitty!
- Sullivan?
- Kitty!
- Sorry, Boo.
Stop him!
Let's get you home.
Finish him off!
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do that, Sullivan!
- Mike?
- Look, it's not that I don't care about the kid.
- Mike, you don't understand.
- Yes, I do. I was just mad, that's all.
I needed some time to think. But you shouldn't have left me out there.
- I'm being attacked.
- No, I'm not attacking you.
I-I-I'm trying to be honest.
Just hear me out.
Look, you and I are a team.
Nothing is more important than our friendship.
I-I-I know, kid.
He-He's too sensitive.
Come on, pal, if you start crying I'm gonna cry and I'll never get through this.
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, but I am now.
Hey, Sulley, I am baring my soul here.
The least you could do is pay attention.
Hey, look at that.
It's Randall. It's...
- Oh.
- Come on!
- Get up! There can't be any witnesses.
- There won't be.
- I'm glad you came back, Mike.
- Somebody's gotta take care you, you big hair ball.
- Schmoopsie-poo, I really can't talk.
- Come on!
Michael, if you don't tell me what's going on right now, we are through!
- Do you hear me? Through!
- Okay, here's the truth.
You know the kid that they're looking for? Sulley let her in.
We tried to send her back, but Waternoose had this secret plot... and now Randall's right behind us, and he's trying to kill us.
You expect me to believe that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?
Mike Wazowski!
- I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!
- Will you move it? Hey! Look out.
Idiot!
- Look out.
Coming through here. Coming through.
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Make way. Move it!
Hurry up. Hurry up.
- There they are!
- Attention, employees.
Randall Boggs has just broken the all-time scare record.
Huh? No, I didn't.
Get out of my way! Let me go!
Go get 'em, Googley Bear.
- There it is!
- Get off my tail. Let me go!
- Sulley, what are you doing?
- Grab on, Mike.
- Are you out of your mind?
- Sulley, what are we doing?
- We have to get Boo's door and find a station.
What a plan.
Simple, yet insane!
- Whoa.
- Oh, boy.
- Hold on!
- Wow!
- Don't look down!
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, no!
No!
- Boo's door!
- There it is!
How are we supposed to get to it now?
Oh, it's a dead end, Sulley.
There he is.
- Make her laugh!
- What? Sulley!
- Just do it!
Ow!
- Get it open!
- Here he comes.
Give me that kid!
- Why couldn't we get banished here?
- Come on. We gotta find another door.
Look! Boo's door!
- There he is. Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Give me your hand.
- Come on. It slides, it slides.
- Ooh, right, right, right.
Jump! I'm right behind you.
Come on!
- Hurry up! Keep moving!
- Get inside!
That was weird.
Mike? Ooh, sorry, buddy.
I hope that hurt, lizard boy.
Great job, buddy.
We lost him.
Boo!
Nice workin' with ya!
- Get it open!
- I'm trying!
- Open the door!
- Come on! Get in here!
Boo!
There they are!
Sulley, what are you doing?
Sulley!
- Looks like we caught the express, pal!
- Do you see 'em?
Straight ahead!
- Kitty!
- Boo!
Look at everybody's favourite scarer now!
You stupid, pathetic waste!
You've been number one for too long,
Sullivan. Now your time is up!
And don't worry,
I'll take good care of the kid.
No!
She's not scared of you any more.
Looks like you're out of a job.
All right. Come on. Over the plate.
Let's see the old stuff here, pal. Come on, now. Chuck 'im. Chuck 'im, baby.
- Hey, please, don't! Don't!
- Hum, baby, hum, baby. Here's the pitch.
And he is out of here!
Mama, another gator got in the house.
Another gator?
Give me that shovel! Come here!
Get it, Ma!
Get that gator!
- Care to do the honours, Mikey?
- With pleasure.
That's right, Boo.
You did it! You beat him.
Come on.
Okay, Boo, it's time to go home.
Take care of yourself and be a good girl, okay?
- Oh, no!
- The power's out. Make her laugh again.
All right. I got a move here.
It'll bring down the house.
- Oh, sorry. She didn't see that.
- What? What'd you do, forget to check if her stupid hood was up? You big dope!
Uncle Mike, try not to yell in front of her.
- You know we still need her to laugh.
- Right.
Hey, Boo! Just kidding. Look!
Funny, right, huh? See, with the...
These are the jokes, kid.
- What's happening?
- Hold on!
When the door lands in the station, cut the power.
You'll have the child and the criminals responsible for this whole mess.
Great. A welcoming committee.
What are we gonna do?
This is the CD A. Come out slowly with the child in plain sight.
Okay. Okay. You got us.
Here we are. Here's the kid.
I'm cooperating. But before you take us away, I have one thing to say.
- Catch!
- We have a toxic projectile.
Isolate the contaminate.
- Halt!
- After the suspect!
- Clear the area!
- Stop him!
- Come on.
- Don't let them get away.
What? Wait, wait! Come back!
He has the child!
Sullivan? Sullivan!
Give me the child!
Give her to me!
Open this door! Open this door!
Sullivan! Don't do it.
- Come on.
- Don't go in that room!
I think we stopped him, Boo.
You're safe now.
You be a good girl, okay?
This has gone far enough, James.
- She's home now.
Just leave her alone.
- I can't do that!
She's seen too much.
You both have.
- It doesn't have to be this way.
- I have no choice!
- Times have changed.
Scaring isn't enough any more.
- But kidnapping children?
I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die!
And I'll silence anyone who gets in my way!
- No!
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- What? What? Wh-Wh-What is this?
- Good night, Mom. Good night, Mom.
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
Well, I don't know about the rest of you guys... but I spotted several big mistakes.
- But... But...
But h-how did... h-how did...
- You know what?
Let's watch my favourite part again, shall we?
I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die!
- What? What?
- I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die!
I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die!
- I'll get him.
All right, come with us.
- Wh-What are you doing?
Take your hands off me. You can't arrest me. I hope you're happy, Sullivan.
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
Where will everyone get their scream now?
The energy crisis will only get worse because of you!
Stay where you are.
Number One wants to talk to you.
Attention!
- Hello, boys.
- Roz?
Two and a half years of undercover work were almost wasted... when you intercepted that child, Mr Sullivan.
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known... that this went all the way up to Waternoose.
Now, about the girl.
I just want to send her home.
Very good.
Bring me a door shredder.
What? You mean...
You mean I can't see her again?
That's the way it has to be.
I'll give you five minutes.
- Well, so long, kid.
- Mike Wazowski!
Yeah. Aw, Boo.
It's been fun.
Go ahead. Go grow up.
Uh, B-Boo... Um, Boo?
Oh, look at that.
Yeah, you know...
Oh, that's cute, yeah.
Uh, Boo, um...
- Well, that's very nice.
- Kitty.
Come here, you.
Oh, he's a happy bear
Nothing's coming out of your closet to scare you any more, right?
Yeah.
Goodbye, Boo.
Kitty.
Kitty has to go.
Boo!
Kitty?
None of this ever happened, gentlemen.
And I don't want to see any paperwork on this.
Take him away.
I bet we get the rest of the day off.
You idiot! They're gonna shut down the factory!
I'm tellin' you, pal, when that wall went up, you should have seen the look on Waternoose's face.
I hope we get a copy of that tape.
Hey, you all right?
Come on, pal. Cheer up.
We did it. We got Boo home.
Oh, sure, we put the factory in the toilet and, gee, hundreds of people will be out of work now.
Not to mention the angry mob that'll come after us when there's no more power.
But hey, at least we had some laughs, right?
Laughs.
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello! Hello! Testing! Testing!
Hey, good evening. How are you?
How are you? Nice to see you.
I tell ya, it's great to be here in your room. Where you from?
Never mind. You're in kindergarten, right? Oh, I love kindergarten.
Best three years of my life.
Of my life.
But I love sports.
Dodge ball was the best. Oh, yeah.
I was the fastest one out there.
Of course, I was the ball. But I...
I was the ball, see?
All right.
Hey, thanks a lot.
I'll be here all week.
Remember to tip your waitresses.
Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota on the first kid of the day.
Not bad, huh? You know, only somebody with perfect comedic timing... could produce this much energy in one shot.
Uh-huh. And the fact that laughter is ten times more powerful than scream had nothing to do with it.
Oh, Googley Bear.
Come here, you.
- Schmoopsie-poo!
- Googley.
Girls. Girls. Quit.
Stop, stop, stop.
Michael, you're such a charmer.
- Hey, did you bring the magazine?
- They just delivered a whole box.
Let me see it!
Sulley and I made the cover, right?
- I don't believe it.
- Googley Bear.
I'm on the cover of a magazine!
Oh, this is great!
- Hey, Sulley!
- Hey, uh, Mike. I was, uh, just...
- Listen, if you got a minute, there's something I wanna show you. Okay?
- B-B-But...
- Close your eyes. Follow me.
- I-I-I...
- Come on. No peeking.
- Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming.
Come on. Keep coming, keep coming.
- Mike!
And follow the sultry sound of my voice.
Okay, stop. Open 'em.
- Ta-da!
- Mike!
- Is that...
- Sorry it took so long, pal.
It was a lot of wood to go through.
You know, it only works if you have every piece.
Boo?
Kitty!
Speed. Marker.
And action.
If I were a rich man
With a million or two
I'd live in a penthouse
In a room with a view
- And if I were handsome
- No way!
- It could happen.
'Cause dreams do come true.
Roll slate.
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin'
Okay, cut.
Okay, you're finished now, right?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Come on, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.
- Oh, sorry.
- See you later, fellas.
- Go get 'em, Mr Solomon.
- You idiot! It's Sullivan, not Solomon.
- What?
- You're messing up the scene.
- Sorry.
- We're never gonna work in Hollywood again.
- Let me do it over.
- Shut up!
- Keep rolling!
- You're making it worse!
Duck and cover, people!
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.
Ta-da!
Aw, Boo, it's been fun.
Go ahead. Go throw up.
- What? Wh-Wh...
What did I say? What? What?
- Cut.
Hey, Ted, good morning!
- Cut.
- Hey, how was that? Was I scary?
- Do I get the part?
- Thank you.
- Can I do it again?
- I can be taller.
- Next.
And action.
Okay, let's move, let's move, let's move. Come on!
Can we get a little more wax on the floor, please?
Wait a minute.
Randall? That cheater.
- He's trying to boost his numbers.
- There's something else.
- What?
- Look-lay in the bag-bay.
- I think you mean ook-lay in the ag-bay.
- What? Didn't I, uh...
Well, you know, maybe you should just take a minute and ead-ray your ipt-scray.
You think he's gonna come through the closet and scare you.
Oh, boy. How do I explain this?
Uh, it's empty. See?
Guess who!
Hey, what's the...
Okay, very funny.
Hey, I look good in a suit.
Marker.
Let her rip! Go!
Shut it off! Shut it off!
Shut it off!
You're making it worse!
But I must admit it
Big guy, you always come through
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
You and me together
That's how it always should be
One without the other
Don't mean nothin'to me
Nothin'to me
Oh, hey!
We're rehearsing a, a scene... for the upcoming company play called...
Put That Thing Back Where It Came From,
Or So Help Me.
It's a musical. Yeah.
Put that thing back where it came from
Or so help me
Get that thing away from me you guys
Put that thing back where it came from or I'll poke myself in the eye
It's, uh, i-it's a work in progress.
I-It's gonna get better.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this year's company play... starring, written and directed by Mike...
- And produced.
- And produced by Mike Wazowski.
Put that thing back where it came from or so help me
So help me
So help me get by
Put that thing back where it came from or so help me
So help me
I just gotta cry
Your seat is right over there, sir.
- Boo!
- There's a child, there's a child
There's a human child
- Oh, no!
- Running around the restaurant
This is really wrong
What in heaven's name will become of us
We who are living in Monstropolis
All right, Wazowski, tell us where the kid is.
Boo!
I will never talk. Never!
She's out of our hair
And just when I dare to care
She says, au contraire
You're my pair of friends
I love you
Keep it together, man.
And so we put that kid back
Where she came from
And she helped us to find
A better tomorrow
Today
Thank you! What a night for my mother to be in the audience, ladies and gentlemen. My mom!
Thank you, Monstropolis!
- I don't have to say it
- Aw, say it anyway.
'Cause we both know it's true
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
You
One more time!
It worked!
- Don't have to say it
- I'm gonna anyway!
- 'Cause we both know it's true
- Let's take it home, big guy!
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
- You
- You! You!
- A-E-l-O
- That means you. Yeah!
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfilment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in
And sees you through
When you wish
Upon a star
Your dreams
Come true
Pretty, huh?
I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that.
About a wish coming true, do you?
Well, I didn't either.
Of course, I'm just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth...
...but... let me tell you what made me change my mind.
One night, a long time...
Pardon me. Wait 'til I, I fix this thing here.
There.
One night, a long time ago...
...my travels took me to a quaint little village.
It was a beautiful night.
The stars were shining like diamonds...
...high above the roofs of that sleepy old town.
Pretty as a picture.
As I wandered along the crooked streets...
...there wasn't a soul to be seen.
The only sign of life was a lighted window...
...in the shop of a wood-carver named, uh, Geppetto.
So, I hopped over.
And looked in.
It was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste.
So what do I do?
I go in.
I looked around.
Of course, being in a strange place like that...
...I didn't know what to expect.
A cricket can't be too careful, you know.
Soon as I saw there was no one about, I made myself at home.
As I stood there warming my... myself, I took a look around.
Well, sir, you never saw such a place.
The most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on.
And all carved out of wood.
And cute little music boxes, each one a work of art.
Shelf after shelf of toys and...
And then something else caught my eye.
A puppet!
You know, one of those marionette things...
...all strings and joints.
Cute little fella.
Ding, ding! Going up?
Good piece of wood too.
Well, now.
It won't take much longer.
Just a little more paint and he's all finished.
I think he'll be all right.
Don't you, Figaro?
Um, huh, uh, beg pardon.
See?
That makes a big difference.
Very good.
Very, very goo...
Well, you can't please everybody.
Now, I have just the name for you.
Pinocchio!
Do you like it, Figaro?
No? You do, don't you, Cleo?
Well, we'll leave it to little Woodenhead.
Do you like it?
That settles it!
Pinocchio it is!
Come on, now, we'll try you out.
Music, Professor!
Hey! Ow, ow, ow, ouch!
Ta-Ta-Take it easy there!
Oh, break it up, will you?
Lot of downbeats in there.
Little Woodenhead
Go play your part
Bring a littlejoy to every heart
Little do you know and yet it's true
That I'm mighty proud of you
Little wooden feet and best of all
Little wooden seat in case you fall
Oh-ho! How graceful!
My little Woodenhead
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.
Say, "How do you do?"
Say hello to Figaro.
Oops! Oh-ho-ho!
Up to mischief already.
You see what happens?
Boo!
Up we go!
You're a cute little fellow.
And that smile?
You know, I....
You rascal. Jealous, huh?
You know, Pinocchio, I think
Figaro is jealous of you.
Oh-ho, don't worry, Figaro.
I sti... Uh-oh.
I wonder what time it is.
It's getting late.
Come, now. We go to bed.
Good night, Pinocchio.
Little funny face.
Good night, Cleo, my little water baby.
Figaro.
You say good night too.
Go on.
Now go to sleep, my little mermaid.
Good night.
This is my idea of comfort.
Solid comfort.
Look at him, Figaro.
He almost looks alive.
Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy?
Oh, well.
Come on. We go to sleep.
Ah, Figaro.
I forgot to open the window.
Oh, Figaro! Look, look!
The wishing star!
Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight;
I wish I may, I wish I might...
...have the wish I make tonight.
Figaro, you know what I wish?
I wish that my little Pinocchio...
...might be a real boy.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think!
A real boy!
A very lovely thought.
But not at all practical.
A real...
...boy.
Quiet!
After all, enough's enough.
Now what's up?
Hey, what's going on here?
As I live and breathe, a fairy!
Mm-mmm.
Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others.
You deserve to have your wish come true.
Little puppet made of pine...
...wake.
The gift of life is thine.
Whew! What they can't do these days!
I can move!
I can talk!
I can walk!
- Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
- Why?
Because tonight, Geppetto wished for a real boy.
- Am I a real boy?
- No, Pinocchio.
To make Geppetto's wish come true will be entirely up to you.
Up to me?
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish...
...and someday you will be a real boy.
A real boy!
That won't be easy.
You must learn to choose between right and wrong.
Right and wrong?
But how will I know?
- How will he know.
- Your conscience will tell you.
- What are conscience?
- What are conscience!
I'll tell ya!
A conscience is that still small voice that people won't listen to.
That's just the trouble with the world today, you see?
- Are you my conscience?
Who, me?
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?
Well, w... uh, I...
Very well.
What is your name?
Oh, Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.
- Kneel, Mr Cricket.
- Huh?
No tricks now.
I dub you
Pinocchio's conscience...
...lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong...
...counsellor in moments of temptation...
...and guide along the straight and narrow path.
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.
Well! Oh-ho-ho!
My, my!
Mmm. Say, that's pretty swell.
Gee... thanks.
But, uh, don't I get a badge or something?
- Well, we'll see.
- You mean maybe I will?
- I shouldn't wonder.
- Make it a gold one?
Maybe.
Now, remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy.
And always let your conscience be your guide.
Goodbye, milady.
Goodbye!
Not bad, says I.
Oh, yeah. Ho-ho-ho.
Almost forgot about you.
Well, Pinoke.
Maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk.
Why?
- Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you?
- Uh-huh!
All right. Sit down, son.
- Now, you see, the world is full of temptations.
- Temptations?
Yep. Temptations.
They're the wrong things that seem right at the time.
But, uh, even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes...
...uh, sometimes the, the wrong things may be right at the wrong time.
Or, uh, visa versa.
Understand?
But I'm gonna do right!
Atta boy, Pinoke.
And I'm gonna help you.
And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle.
Like this.
Like this?
No, no. Try it again, Pinoke.
Like this?
No, son. Now, listen.
That's it! Come on, now, let's sing it!
When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
Not just a little squeak
Pucker up and blow
- And if your whistle's weak, yell
- Jiminy Cricket?
Right! Take the straight and narrow path and if you start to slide
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
And always let your conscience be your guide
Take the straight and narrow path and if you start to slide
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
Whoo-hoo!
And always let your conscience be your guide
And always let your conscience be your guide
- Who is there?
- It's me!
Oh, it's me.
Shh, Figaro.
There's somebody in here.
Be careful now, Figaro.
He might spring out on us at any time.
He's in here somewhere.
Here I am!
Oh... Pinocchio.
How did you get down here?
- I fell down.
- Oh, you did.
Ohh! You're talking!
- N-N-N-No!
- Yes, and I can move too!
No, n-no, you, you can't.
I-I'm dreaming in my sleep.
W-W-Wake me up. Wake me up!
Now we see who is dreaming.
Go on. Say something.
Gee, you're funny.
Do it again!
- You do talk!
- Yes, the Blue Fairy came...
The Blue Fairy?
- And I got a conscience.
- A conscience!
And someday I'm gonna be a real boy!
A real boy! It is my wish.
It's come true!
Figaro, look!
He... He's alive. He can talk!
- Let's say hello to Figaro.
- Hello to Figaro.
Ohh. Oh, Cleo, I almost forgot.
Look! It's Pinocchio!
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?
Yeah, cute.
This calls for a celebration.
Music!
You start one, Pinocchio.
Oh, boy. A party!
Mind if I cut in?
How about sitting out the next one, babe, huh?
Whoop! Hey, whoa, let me out!
Let me out!
Come, Cleo, join the party.
Dance!
Ooh, nice.
Gathering toys
For my little boy
Look! Pretty!
Help!
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where's the bucket?
Help! Water! Where's the water?
Here it is! I got it!
Here's water! Here's some water!
Help! Where's water?
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed...
...before something else happens.
Little man, you've had a busy night.
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.
Why?
Oh, everybody has to sleep.
Figaro goes to sleep... and Cleo...
...and besides, tomorrow you've got to go to school.
Why?
Oh, to learn things and...
...and get smart.
Why?
Because...
- Oh, look, Father! Look!
- Now, wait. Stand still now.
- What are those?
- Huh? Oh, those.
They are your schoolmates.
Girls and boys. Uh, no-now, get in...
- Real boys?
- Yes.
But hurry now.
Oh, oh, wai-wai-wait! Wait. Eh...
Here's an apple for your teacher. Now turn around...
...and let me look you over.
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Here.
Run along now.
Fig, wait!
Come back here, Figaro.
School is not for you.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, son.
Hurry back.
Ah, Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter...
...of little innocent children wending their way to school.
Thirsty little minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge.
School, a noble institution.
What would this stupid world be without...
Well, well, well!
Stromboli!
So that old rascal's back in town, eh?
Remember, Giddy, the time
I tied strings on you...
...and passed you off as a puppet?
We nearly put one over on that old gypsy that time.
A little wooden boy.
Now, who'd have...
A wooden boy!
Look, Giddy, look!
It's amazing.
A live puppet without strings.
A thing like that ought to be worth a fortune to someone.
Now let me see.
That's it! Stromboli!
Why, that fat old faker would give his... Listen.
If we play our cards right, we'll be on Easy Street...
...or my name isn't Honest John.
Quick, we'll head him off.
Shh! Now's our...
No, no, stupid.
Don't be crude.
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.
Ah, yes, Skinny, as I was saying to the Duchess only yesterday...
Oh! Oh, how clumsy of me.
Oh, my, my, my, my.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, I do hope you're not injured.
- I'm all right.
- Oh, splendid.
Well, well, hmm.
Quite a scholar, I see.
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.
School. Ah, yes.
Then you haven't heard of the easy road to success.
- Uh-uh.
- No?
I'm speaking, my boy, of the theatre.
Here's your apple.
Bright lights, music...
...applause, fame!
- Fame?
- Yes!
And with that personality, that profile, that physique...
...he's a natural born actor, eh, Giddy?
- But I'm going...
- Straight to the top.
Why, I can see your name in lights, lights six feet high.
- Uh... What is your name?
- Pinocchio.
Pinocchio! P-I-N... Eh, uh...
...U-O... Eh, P-I... Eh...
We're wasting precious time.
Come, on to the theatre.

Shh!
Why, my boy, huh, you must be seeing things.
Oh, no, that's my conscience. He...
Now, now, now.
Just calm down.
Why, there's nothing up there to be afraid of.
Oh!
Psst! Pinoke!
Psst! Pinoke! Over here.
- Over here.
- Oh, Jiminy!
- I'm going to be an actor.
- All right, son, take it easy now.
Remember what I said about temptation?

- Well, that's him.
Oh, no, Jiminy, that's Mr Honest John.
Honest John?
Get this thing off.
Get me outta here!
Get me out of here!
Oh!
All right then, here's what we'll tell 'em:
You can't go to the theatre, say "Thank you just the same"...
...you're sorry but you've got to go to school.
Pinocchio!
Oh, Pinocchio!
Here they come, Pinoke.
Now, you tell 'em.
Oh, little boy!
Ah, there you are!
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes, on to the theatre!
Goodbye, Jiminy!
Goodbye!
- Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me

- Hey, Pinoke, you can't...
- A high silk hat and a silver cane
- A watch of gold with a diamond chain
- There he goes.
- Oh, what'll I do? I'll run and tell his father.
- Hi diddle dee day
- An actor's life is gay
- No, that'd be snitching.
I'll go after him myself.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...to conclude the performance of this great show...
...Stromboli the Master Showman... that's a-me...
...and by special permission of the management...
...that's a-me too...
...is presenting to you something...
...you will absolutely refuse to believe.
Well, looks like a sell-out.
Introducing the only marionette...
...who can sing and dance...
...absolutely without the aids of strings.
I hope so.
The one and only... Pinocchio!
Hmph! What a build-up.
I got no strings to hold me dow...
Go ahead, make a fool of yourself.
Then maybe you'll listen to your conscience.
Cute kid.
I got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret or make me frown
I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me
Heigh-ho the merry-o
That's the only way to be
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me
I got no strings so I can have fun
- What I told you, huh?
- I'm not tied up with anyone
They got strings but you can see
There are no strings on me
You have no strings
Your arms is free
To love me by the Zuider Zee
Ja, ja, ja
If you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you
You got no strings
Comme ci, comme ca
Your savoir faire is ooo-la-la
I've got strings but entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you
Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendezvous
Where me and Ivan go
But I'd rather go with you
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!
There are no strings on me
Hmm, they like him.
He's a success.
Gosh, maybe I was wrong.
Well, guess he won't need me any more.
What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?
What could have happened to him?
Where could he be at this hour?
I'd better go out again and look for him.
And remember, nobody eats a bite until I find him.
I got-a no strings but I got-a the brain
I buy a new suit and I swing-a the chain
I eat-a the best and I drink-a champagne
I got-a no strings on me
- Bravo, Pinocchio!
- They like me.
Hmm, two hundred.
- You are sensational!
- Ya mean I'm good?
Ahh, three hundred.
You are colossal!
Does that mean I'm an actor?
Sure. I will push you in the public's eye.
Your face, she will be on everybody's tongue.
- Will she?
- Ye... Uh, huh?
What's this?
Ahhh!
For you, my little Pinocchio.
For me? Gee, thanks!
I'll run right home and tell my father.
Home?
Oh, sure. Going home to your father.
Oh, that is very comical!
- Ya mean it's funny?
- Oh, sure! Yes.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Be back in the morning.
Going home.
There, this will be your home...
...where I can find you always.
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!
To me you are belonging.
We will tour the world.
Paris. London.
Monte Carlo.
"Constantinopolee."
- No, no!
- Yes!
We start tonight!
Hmm.
You will make lots of money... for me!
And when you are growing too old...
...you will make good... firewood!
Let me outta here! I gotta get out! You can't keep me!
Quiet! Shut-a up...
...before I knock-a you silly!
Good night...
...my little wooden gold mine.
No! No, wait! Let me out!
I'll tell my father!
Giddy-up!
Get along there.
Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy, where are ya?
Jiminy Cricket!
Well, there he goes.
Sitting in the lap of luxury, the world at his feet.
Oh, well, I can always say I knew him when.
I'll just go out of his life quietly.
I would like to wish him luck though.
Sure! Why not?
Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
It's me, your old friend Jiminy, remember?
Jiminy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya!
Pinocchio!
What's happened?
- What did he do to ya?
- Oh, he was mad.
He said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye.
- Yeah?
- A-A-And just 'cause I'm a gold brick...
...he-he's gonna chop me into firewood!
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.
I'll have you out of here in no time at all.
Why, this is... eh, just as easy as... rollin' off a...
Kind of rusty.
- Needs a little oil!
- Needs a little oil, needs a little oil, a little oil.
That's what I said.
Must be one of the old models.
You mean, you can't open it?
Yeah.
Looks pretty hopeless.
It'll take a miracle to get us out of here.
Gee.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio!
Giddy-up!
Pinocch...
A fine conscience
I turned out to be.
I should've listened to you, Jiminy.
No, it was my fault.
I shouldn't have walked out on you.
Guess I'll never see my father again.
Oh, buck up, son.
It could be worse.
Be cheerful, like me.
Aw, take it easy, son.
Come on, blow.
Thatta boy.
Oh, well, it stopped raining anyway.
Hey, that star again!
Uh, the lady, the... Ooh!
- The fairy!
- What'll she say?
- What'll I tell her?
- You might tell her the truth.
- Why, Pinocchio.
- Uh, eh, hello!
Sir Jiminy!
Well! Uh, this is a... a pleasant surprise. Ha-ha.
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school?
School? Well, I... um...
Uh... Go ahead, tell her.
I was going to school
'til I met somebody.
- Met somebody?
- Yeah. Uh, two big monsters...
...with big green eyes!
- Why, I... I...
- Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?
No, ma'am.
But they tied me in a big sack.
You don't say!
And where was Sir Jiminy?
Eh, huh? Oh, Jiminy?
Hey, psst!
Leave me outta this.
They put him in a little sack.
- No!
- Yeah!
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.
They chopped me into firewood.
Oh! Oh, look!
My nose!
What's happened?
Perhaps you haven't been telling the truth, Pinocchio.
- "Perhaps"?
- Oh, but I have, every single word.
Oh, please help me!
I'm awful sorry.
You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing...
...until it's as plain as the nose on your face.
She's right, Pinoke.
You better come clean.
I'll never lie again.
Honest, I won't.
Please, Your Honor...
Uh, uh, I mean, Miss Fairy.
Give him another chance, for my sake.
Will ya, huh?
I'll forgive you this once.
But remember...
...a boy who won't be good might just as well be made of wood.
- We'll be good, won't we?
- We'll be good, won't we?
Very well. But this is the last time I can help you.
Gee, look, Jiminy, my nose!
Hey, we're free!
Come on, Pinoke!
I buy a new suit and I swing-a the cane
I eat-a the fish and I drink-a champagne
I got no strings on me
- Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.
- Goodbye, Mr Strombo...
Shh! Quiet! Let's get outta here before something else happens.
Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me
A high silk hat and a silver cane
A watch of gold with a diamond chain
Hi diddle dee day
An actor's life is gay
It's great to be a celebrity
An actor's life for me
And the dummy fell for it...
...hook, line and sinker!
And he still thinks we're his friends.
And did Stromboli pay...
...plenty!
That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop...
...eh, Giddy?
Now, uh, coachman...
...what's your proposition?
Well...
...how would you blokes like to make some real money?
Well! And who do we have to, eh...
No, no!
Nothing like that.
You see...
I'm collecting stupid little boys.
- Stupid little boys?
- You know...
...the disobedient ones what play hookey from school.
And you see...
Yes.
Oh!
And I takes 'em to Pleasure Island!
Ah, Pleasure Island.
Pleasure Island?
But the law, suppose they...
No, no. There is no risk.
They never come back...
...as boys!
Now, I've got a coach load leaving at midnight.
We'll meet at the crossroads, and no double-crossing!
- No, sir.
- Scout around...
...and any good prospects you find, bring 'em to me.
- Yes, Chief.
- I'll pay you well.
- I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes.
No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.
- You'd better.
- I will. I'm going to school.
- That's the stuff, Pinoke.
- I'd rather be smart than be an actor.
Now you're talkin'! Come on, slowpoke, I'll race ya home.
Well, well, Pinocchio.
What's your rush?
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello.
Well, how is the great actor?
I don't wanna be an actor.
Stromboli was terrible.
- He was?
- Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage...
- He did?
- Uh-huh, but I learned my lesson.
I'm going...
Oh, you poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.
That's it, you are a nervous wreck!
We must diagnose this case at once.
Quick, Doctor, your notebook.
Bless my soul.
Hmmm, mm-hmm.
My, my.
Just as I thought.
A slight touch of monetary complications...
...with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions of the flying trapezes.
Mm-hmm. Say "hippopotamus."
- Hi-ho-hotamus.
- I knew it!
Compound transmission of the pandemonium with percussion...
...and spasmodic frantic disintegration.
- Close your eyes. What do you see?
- Nothing.
- Open them. Now what do you see?
- Spots.
Aha! Now that heart.
Ooh, my goodness!
A palpitating syncopation of the killer diller...
...with the wicky wacky stomping of the floy joy.
Quick, Doctor, that report.
Ooh, this makes it perfectly clear!
My boy, you are allergic.
- Allergic?
- Yes, and there is only one cure.
- A vacation on Pleasure Island!
- Pleasure Island?
Yes, that happy land of carefree boys...
...where every day is a holiday!
- But I can't go. I...
- Why, of course you can go.
I'm giving you my ticket.
- Here.
- Thanks! But I'm...
Oh, tut-tut-tut-tut, I insist.
Your health comes first.
Come, the coach departs at midnight.
Hi diddle dee dee
It's Pleasure Isle for me
Where every day is a holiday
And kids have nothing to do but play
Pinoke!
Oh, Pinoke? Now where do you suppose he... Huh?
Pinocchio!
Hey! Come back!
Giddy-up!
Well...
...here we go again.
My name's Lampwick.
What's yours?
Pinocchio.
- Ever been to Pleasure Island?
- Uh-uh, but Mr Honest John gave me...
Me neither, but they say it's a swell joint. No school, no cops.
You can tear the joint apart, and nobody says a word.
- Honest John gave me...
- Loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
- And it's all free!
- Honest John...
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait!
Right here, boys!
Right here!
Get your cake, pie, dill pickles and ice cream.
Eat all you can. Be a glutton.
Stuff yourselves.
It's all free, boys. It's all free.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
The Rough House.
The Rough House.
It's the roughest, toughest joint ya ever seen.
- Come in and pick a fight, boys.
- Oh, boy, a scrap!
Come on, let's go in and poke somebody in the nose.
- Why?
- Ah, just for the fun of it.
Okay, Lampy.
Tobacco Road. Tobacco Road.
Get your cigars, cigarettes and chewin' tobacco.
Come in and smoke your heads off.
There's nobody here to stop you.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio! There's somethin'... phoney about all this.
I gotta get him outta here.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! See the model home.
It's open for destruction, and it's all yours, boys!
It's all yours!
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?
Yeah! Bein' bad's a lot of fun, ain't it?
Yeah, uh-huh. Get a load of that stained-glass window.
All right now, hop to it, you blokes.
Come on, come on! Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.
Now get below and get them crates ready.
Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio?
Where is everybody?
The place is like a graveyard.
I don't like the looks of this.
Pinocchio!
Hey, where are you?
Where d'you suppose all the kids went to, Lampwick?
Ah, they're around here somewheres. What do you care?
- You're having a good time, ain't ya?
- Uh-huh, I sure am.
Oh, boy! This is the life, huh, Pinoky?
Yeah!
It sure is!
Ah, you smoke like me grandmother!
Come on, take a big drag like this.
Okay, Lampy.
Some fun, huh, kid?
Okay, Slats, your shot.
What's the matter, Slats?
Losin' your grip?
Pinocchio! So this is where I find you.
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
Look at yourself. Smoking...
...playing pool! Ow! You are coming right home with me this minute!
Hey! Who's the beetle?
Let go! Put me down!
Let me out of here. Let me out!
He's my conscience. He tells me what's right and wrong.
What? You mean to tell me you take orders from a grasshopper?
Grasshopper? Look here, you, you impudent young pup!
It wouldn't hurt you to take orders from your grasshopp...
...your conscience, if you have one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.
Why... Why... Ya young hoodlum!
I'll... I'll knock your block off!
Why, I'll take you apart and put you back together.
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy.
He's my best friend.
Why, I'll... Your best friend?
And what am I?
Just your conscience.
Okay, that settles it.
- But, Jiminy...
- You buttered your bread, now sleep in it.
Ha-ha-ha!
Go on, laugh.
Make a jackass out of yourself.
I'm through! This is the end.
But, Jiminy, Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
Lampwick. Hmph!
Come on, come on.
Let him go.
Lampwick. Hmph, Lampwick!
Burns me up. After all
I tried to do for him.
Who's his conscience anyway?
Me or that, that hoodlum Lampwick?
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.
Open up that door!
Open up!
I wanna go home!
Come on, you blokes!
Keep 'em moving!
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.
Where'd all the donkeys come from?
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.
And what's your name?
Okay, you'll do!
In you go!
You boys'll bring a nice price.
All right, next!
- And what might your name be?
- Alexander.
Hmm, so you can talk.
Ye-Yes, sir. I wanna go home to my mama!
Take him back!
He can still talk!
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey!
- Let me outta here!
- Quiet!
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it.
"Boys"? So that's what...
Pinocchio!
Ha! To hear that beetle talk...
...you'd think somethin' was going to happen to us.
Conscience. Nah, phooey!
Where does he get that stuff?
"How do you ever expect to be a real boy?"
What's he think
I look like, a jackass?
You sure do!
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.
Did that come out of me?
Oh!
Huh?
What the...
What's goin' on?
I've been double-crossed!
Help! Help!
Somebody, help!
I've been framed! Help!
Please, you gotta help me.
Oh, be a pal.
Call that beetle!
Call anybody!
Mama! Mama!
- Oh, what's happened?
- I hope I'm not too late.
What'll I do?
- Pinocchio!
- Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!
Wait, Pinoke! The kids, the boys, they're all donkeys!
Oh, you too!
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.
Hurry up... before they see us.
You gotta jump!
Jiminy.
Jiminy, y-you all right?
Sure. I thought we'd never make it.
Certainly feels good to be back on...
...dry land.
Come on, let's get home.
Father! Father, I'm home!
- We're home, Mr Geppetto! Home again!
- It's me, Pinocchio!
- I'm home to stay!
- Here he is, Mr Geppetto. Home at last.
Hey, maybe he's asleep.
Father! Father, it's me!
Pinoke, come here.
Look. He ain't here.
He... He's gone.
Yeah, and Figaro.
And Cleo too.
Maybe something awful happened to him.
Don't worry, son, he probably hasn't gone far.
Hey.
- It's a message.
- What's it say?
- It's about your father.
- Where is he?
Why, uh, uh, it says here he, uh...
...he went looking for you and, uh, uh, he was swallowed by a whale.
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah, uh-huh. A... A whale?
- A whale named Monstro.
- Oh, he's...
But, but wait.
He's alive.
- Alive? Where?
- Why, uh, uh...
...inside the whale at the, at the bottom of the sea.
- Bottom of the sea?
- Uh-huh. Uh... Hey! Where you going?
I'm going to find him.
But, Pinoke, are you crazy?
Don't you realize, uh, he's in a whale?
I've gotta go to him.
Hey, Pinoke, wait!
Listen here, son.
But this Monstro,
I've heard of him.
He's a whale of a whale.
Why, he swallows whole ships alive.
Tie it good and tight now.
And besides, it's dangerous.
- Why, I...
- Bye, Jiminy.
Goodbye? I may be live bait down there, but I'm with ya.
Come on, let's go.
Look out below!
Gangway, down there.
Gee, what a big place.
- Come on, Jiminy.
- All right.
Soon as I take on some ballast.
One side, sister.
Well, so long.
Hmm, put it in the wrong end.
Hmph, no more privacy than a goldfish.
Ooh, chilly.
Father!
Father!
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!
Father!
Father! Huh, he ain't my father.
Mr Geppetto!
Hey, what the...
Hey, le... let go!
Run along, ya little... squirt.
What's the matter? Can't a fellow, uh... I was only...
We were only looking for Monstro.
That got 'em.
Father!
Father!
Oh, hello.
Oh! Uh...
...can you tell me where we can find Monstro?
Gee, they're scared.
Uh, pardon me, pearl...
...are you acquainted with Monstro the whale?
Whoa, hold it there.
Father!
One side there, son.
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.
Hey, what the...
Whoa, quit, quit, quit shoving now.
Quit, whoa. Don't crowd.
Now take it easy. Take it easy there.
Whoa-ho-ho there. Whoa!
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.
Could any of you tell me where to find Monstro?
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa, whoa! Hey!
Uh, sakes alive.
Father!
- Father!
- Mr Geppetto!
Not a bite for days.
We can't hold out much longer.
I never thought...
...it would end this way, Figaro.
Starving to death...
...in the belly of a whale.
My poor little Pinocchio.
He was such a good boy.
It's hopeless, Figaro.
There isn't a fish left.
If the monster doesn't wake up soon, I...
I'm afraid we...
We are done for.
Here they come!
Tuna! Oh, tuna fish!
Food! We'll eat!
Here's a big one!
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey! Wait a minute!
Ha-Have you seen...
Monstro!
We got to get out of here!
Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me.
Never saw so many!
Here's another one!
Enough for weeks!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey, blubber mouth, open up!
I got to get in there!
Looks like the last of them.
Here's a big one.
Only a few left.
We got to work fast!
- Hey!
- Here's another one.
Hey, Father!
- Father!
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio!
- Pinocchio!
- Father!
Pinocchio, my son!
- Hey, Father, here I am!
- Huh?
Oh, oh, yes!
Pinocchio, my boy!
- I... I'm so happy to see you!
- Me too, Father!
- Oops!
- Figaro! Ah, Figaro.
Cleo! Oh, Cleo!
- You're here too.
- Yes!
We are all together again!
- Oh, you, you are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.
You, you mustn't catch cold.
- But I came to save you!
- You shouldn't have come down here.
- But, Father!
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.
Let me take your hat. Oh!
Pinocchio!
What's the matter?
- Those ears!
- Huh? Ears?
Oh, these.
Hah. Oh, that's nothing.
I got a tail too.
Pinocchio!
What's happened to you?
Well, I... I... I...
Oh, never mind now.
Old Geppetto has his little Woodenhead.
Nothing else matters.
I got to get in!
My pal's in there!
Come on, you big moose!
Open up, I tell ya...
Hey! Cut it out!
Oh, boy.
Beat it, you buzzards!
Get out? Oh, no, no, son.
I've tried every way.
Why, I, I even built a raft.
- A raft? That's it!
- Huh?
We'll take the raft, and when the whale opens its mouth...
No, no, no, no.
N-Now listen, son.
He only opens his mouth when he's eating.
Then everything comes in.
Nothing goes out.
- Oh.
- It's hopeless, Pinocchio.
Come. We make a nice fire and we cook some of the fish.
- A fire! That's it!
- Yes. And then we'll all eat again.
A great big fire!
Lots of smoke.
Smoke? Oh, yeah, sure.
A smoked fish will taste good.
- Quick, some wood.
- Pinocchio, not the chair!
Hurry, Father. More wood!
Oh, what will we sit on if we...
We won't need it.
We're getting out!
Getting out?
But how?
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze?
Ohh, that will make him mad.
Well, it's about time!
- It won't work!
- Hurry, Father! Climb aboard!
- We'll never get by those teeth!
- Yes, we will!
Hey, which way you going?
Wait for me!
Hang on! Here we go!
Gesundheit.
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it! Faster, faster!
It's no use!
We're done for!
We made it!
Look! Now he is mad!
I told you he'd be furious!
- He's gone!
- Where did he go?
Look out!
Hang on!
He's coming back.
Hurry!
He's trying to kill us!
Paddle, son!
Let's go back!
Look out! Jump!
Father! Father!
Oh, Father!
Pinocchio, swim for shore.
Swim for shore.
Hang on, Father!
Save... yourself.
Pinocchio...
...save yourself.
Don't mind me, son.
Save yourself, Pinocchio.
Pinocchio?
Oh, Pinocchio!
Pinocchi...
My boy.
My brave little boy.
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish...
...and someday you will be a real boy.
Awake, Pinocchio.
Awake.
Father!
Whatcha crying for?
'Cause... you are dead,
Pinocchio.
No! No, I'm not.
Yes, yes, you are.
Now, lie down.
But, Father, I'm alive. See?
And... And I'm, uh...
I'm... I'm real.
I'm a real boy!
You're alive!
And, and you are a real boy!
- Yea! Whoopie!
- A real live boy!
This calls for a celebration!
Professor, lots of music!
Well! Huh. Th-This is practically where I came in.
Thank you, milady.
He deserved to be a real boy.
And it sure was nice of you to...
Huh? Wha... Uh... Wh... Wh...
Well, I'll be!
My, my!
Solid gold too.
Oh, I think it's swell!
When your heart is in your dream
No request
Is too extreme
When you wish
Upon a star
Your dreams come true
You'll find your dreams come true
And her ambition was to extend her realm...
to all the regions of the known world.
To this end, she gathered an army.
And she bore a son and named him Nekron.
And him she tutored in the black arts
and in the powers of the mind.
And when Nekron came of age...
and attained mastery of those powers...
together they seized control
of the region of Ice.
And from their castle called Ice Peak...
they sent a giant glacier
rumbling southward.
No village or people could stand
against its relentless onslaught.
And so the remnants of humanity
fled south...
and huddled for warmth
among the volcanoes...
of a mountain region
ruled by a generous king named Jarol...
from his fortress,
which men called Fire Keep.
And still Nekron
pushed the Ice ever southward...
into the temperate zone toward Fire Keep.
And no one dared guess at the outcome...
of a meeting on the field of battle...
between Fire and Ice.
Hold your positions, men. Steady.
Lam, it cannot be stopped.
Join your brother.
You have done well, my son.
The North Village has fallen. We have won.
I want to thank you, Mother.
The Great Plain is all that stands between ourselves and Fire Keep.
That is a long distance.
A distance we may not have to travel.
I am sending our envoys to Jarol with our new demands.
- He will not submit.
- Perhaps.
You will present our demands to King Jarol at Fire Keep and... give our royal regards to his lovely daughter.
But, Father, I want to be with you when you meet Nekron's men.
You will serve your people better here with your studies, my daughter.
Give me your love.
You have it always, Father.
All matter in our world is from the natural bases... which are earth, air, fire and water.
The four elements from which all things are created.
How can you talk about elements when the war draws nearer to us ever hour?
Princess Teegra, we all have our duty.
Your father's duty is to be king and lead.
Your brother's duty is to soldier.
And your duty is to learn.
You mean my duty is to stay shut up... while all the men do the fighting and share all the glory.
We think that stinks.
Don't we, Shaitan?
If you peacefully surrender, my lord Nekron will cease the destruction of...
This is your message of peace?
A demand for our total and unconditional surrender?
We call it an offer of alliance, Your Majesty.
I call it blackmail.
My lord Nekron's offer...
To hell with Nekron and his offer.
We are free men, not slaves.
King Jarol, be reasonable.
My son, Taro, speaks more with his heart than with his head.
But he speaks for all of us.
There can be no alliance.
We will fight you to the death.
Perhaps, you will soon change your mind.
No!
Teegra!
Guards!
Make for the glacier. Man the Dragonhawks.
Hurry!
The Dragonhawks will find her, Father.
They've got to.
The night's so dark, the jungle so thick.
A bird couldn't find its own nest.
- What do we do then, Father?
- We wait.
- For Nekron's new demands?
- For his siege!
What is your report?
Have you done as I commanded?
Have you captured the girl, Teegra,
Jarol's daughter?
Where is she?
Bring her forth that I may see her.
- Gone.
- Gone?
Gone!
Escaped? You filth-spawned scum!
What punishment does failure demand?
Death.
Find the girl.
Find her, or his punishment shall be yours.
Gods of my father.
What do you want?
If you want it, take it.
I am not a thief.
Not so close, you'll burn it.
I've always lived close to a fire.
Sometimes in the night, I'm so afraid.
It's getting colder.
- Cold comes from Nekron.
- I know.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home to my people.
- Where is home?
- Far away, to the south.
- I'm going south, too.
- Yeah?
You can come along if you behave yourself.
If I behave myself?
No.
Larn.
You've caught me, but you'll never hand me over to Nekron.
You'll have to kill me first.
Don't hunt for death, boy.
It finds us all soon enough.
The travois was to keep you from killing yourself till you're all healed.
You need rest and food.
If you're gonna kill the Ice Lord, boy, you better learn to live with pain.
Ice Lord? You mean you're fighting Nekron?
Him and his mother.
That wolf bitch, Juliana.
Teegra!
They were here.
Nekron's dogs, they got the girl.
They took her west.
Guard Teegra.
They camped less than two miles from here.
Come.
I saw the girl before.
She is on the far side of the big tree.
You go get her out, and I'll distract the others.
- There must be 50 of them.
- That sounds about right.
- Where's the girl?
- I couldn't find her.
- No!
- The horses!
No, they'd be on our heels before we could reach them.
- But Teegra's still back there.
- Then we'll come back for her.
First, we lead the Nekron's dogs on a wild chase.
Come.
We'll take our stand up there. Come.
Enough!
I want you to go to Nekron, to his mother, Juliana.
- We must negotiate.
- With the enemy?
No man is wholly evil.
Surely there is some way to appeal to Nekron.
You expect his mercy?
Father, do you know what he will do if I enter his land under a flag of truce?
We have no choice!
We must take that risk.
You must take that risk, my son, for the sake of Fire Keep.
For the sake of your sister.
Go, ride swiftly.
Welcome to my hearth.
I am Roliel and these woods are my home.
You've had a trying journey.
Please let me give you some food and drink.
First, you shall rest. Then we will talk.
Poor, poor darling.
Did Great Otwa frighten you?
You mustn't be afraid.
He's as gentle as a child.
I saw him twist a chain apart with his bare hands.
Yes, he is strong, my sweet.
But he means well, my darling.
He brought you to me, did he not?
I'm so tired.
Yes, my poor, poor darling.
Yes, you're so tired... and so beautiful.
You must...
Tell me your secrets.
Nekron?
The girl is wanted by Nekron? The bitch!
She brings danger into my house!
Perhaps I can turn this to my advantage.
Otwa, my son.
Go and bring the subhumans,
Nekron's dogs.
Tell them we have the girl that he wants.
Tell them he can have her, for a price.
Kill.
Get out of here.
- No.
- The hell you won't.
Go find the girl.
Enter, my son. It is not barred.
What's wrong with you?
Where are the dogs?
You would do this...
Why do the living... disturb the sleep of the dead?
I followed a trail. I seek a girl, Teegra.
A girl?
Yes. She did this to me.
She and Nekron.
Cursed Nekron.
Where can I find her?
- Why should I answer?
- For revenge against Nekron.
Nekron?
Akatar. They take her to Akatar.
And from there to the Icy King's realm.
Avenge me.
Avenge me!
Akatar.
Teegra!
My Prince, all is arranged.
I've hired a ship. It waits for us at the dock.
Nekron waits at Ice Peak.
Get the gangplanks aboard.
Move, you scum!
We must be well on our way before sunrise.
Why have you brought me this?
This is your bride, my son.
She will be mother to your sons.
How thoughtful, Mother.
I need no bride, and no sons.
- But you need heirs.
- I need nothing!
Nekron?
Nekron, you're a great power in the world.
You have all that any man ever wants or needed.
And yet you despair.
For there is one thing you lack.
One gift that only you can bestow between our people.
Peace.
This is the gift that heals the heart of the giver.
Nekron, I extend my hand in friendship.
I offer peace between our people.
Will you not take my hand?
Will you not call me friend?
Woman...
I spit on peace.
I spit on you.
Next time you present me with one of your little sluts, Mother dear...
I'll squash you like a bug.
Get that garbage out of here.
Don't look up.
We are riders of Fire Keep.
We pay no heed to such trash.
We have come, Lord Nekron, to negotiate between our two peoples.
And the return to Fire Keep of my sister, Teegra... whom your warriors basely kidnapped.
My father, King Jarol, has empowered me... to offer a peace between our kingdoms... in exchange for his continued sovereignty... and my sister's freedom.
It seems to me that my envoys made a similar offer not long since... and that it was spurned by your illustrious sire.
You know full well, Nekron, that offer was made... before your minions kidnapped my sister.
I fear, Good Prince,
I cannot offer peace to a people... who have refused to proclaim me their rightful overlord.
As to your sister...
I must admit that until this moment... the idea of mating with her filled me with loathing.
Perhaps I should reconsider.
Your sister, after all, is not wholly unattractive.
As lesser beasts go.
Pig you are.
And like a pig shall you die.
No!
No, I don't think so.
You interest me.
Guards!
Bring him to me.
Release him.
- Why have you come seeking me?
- You killed my people.
We've had to dispose of so many undesirables of late.
Let him rest. There is still fight in him.
Larn.
Teegra, is that you?
- Teegra, are you all right?
- Yes. I'm trying to unlock the door.
Never mind the door, you've to get out of here.
I'm not leaving without you.
Maybe I can get a key somehow.
No, Teegra, don't.
Is he certain?
- It was my son you saw?
- They called him Prince Taro.
He died.
- What about Teegra?
- He's got her, too.
Maybe she's still alive.
It's a chance.
Believe what you want, but that glacier is a fact.
For three days and nights it's been pushing south.
A thousand souls lost because of Nekron's rage.
Fire Keep is next. We must attack.
I need the Dragonhawks.
- The Dragonhawks are too few.
- Enough to get in with.
One us might get through and destroy him.
But if that glacier passes beyond the river,
I will have no choice.
I will have to release the lava.
Teegra.
Larn.
Nekron!
Die! Die! Why don't you die?
No, Larn! No, it's over, don't you see?
We have to start over.
[ Man ] You know, there's been a heap of legends and tall tales... about Robin Hood.
All different too.
Well, we folks of the animal kingdom have our own version.
It's the story of what really happened in Sherwood Forest.
[ Whistling ]
[ Imitates Trumpet ]
[ Scatting ]
[ Rooster Laughing ]
[ Whistling ]
[ Whistling, Imitating Trumpet ]
[ Whistling ]
Oh, incidentally,
I'm Allan-a-Dale, a minstrel.
That's an early-day folk singer.
And my job is to... tell it like it is.
Or was or whatever.
Robin Hood and Little John walkin' through the forest
Laughin' back and forth at what the other'n has to say
Reminiscin' this 'n' that and havin' such a good time
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
Never ever thinkin' there was danger in the water
They were drinkin'
They just guzzled it down
Never dreamin' that a schemin' sheriff and his posse
Was a-watchin' them and gatherin' around
Robin Hood and Little John runnin' through the forest
Jumpin' fences, dodgin' trees and tryin' to get away
Contemplatin' nothin' but escapin' and finally makin' it
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
You know something, Robin?
You're taking too many chances.
Chances?
You must be joking.
That was just a bit of a lark, Little John.
Yeah?
Take a look at your hat.
That's not a candle on a cake.
Hello. This one almost had my name on it, didn't it?
They're getting better, you know.
You've got to admit it.
They are getting better.
Huh, yeah. The next time that sheriff'll probably have a rope around our necks.
[ Gagging ] Pretty hard to laugh hangin' there, Rob.
Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse couldn't lift you off the ground.
- En garde!
- Hey, watch it, Rob.
That's the only hat I've got.
Oh, come along.
You worry too much, old boy.
You know something, Robin?
I was just wonderin'.
Are we good guys or bad guys?
You know. I mean, uh, our robbin' the rich to feed the poor.
"Rob"?
[ Clicking Tongue ]
That's a naughty word.
We never rob.
We just... sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it.
Borrow? Huh.
Boy, are we in debt.
[ Trumpet Sounding ]
[ Chuckling ]
That sounds like another collection day for the poor. Eh, Johnny boy?
Yeah. Sweet charity.
Taxes!
[ Laughs ] Taxes!
Beautiful, lovely taxes!
[ Laughing ]
Sire, you have an absolute skill... for encouraging contributions from the poor. [ Chuckling ]
To coin a phrase, my dear counselor, rob the poor to feed the rich.
- [ Laughing ] Am I right?
- [ Laughing ]
Tell me, what is the next stop, Sir Hiss?
Uh, let me see.
Uh, I--
Oh! Yes.
The next stop is Nottingham, sire.
Oh! The richest plum of them all.
Notting--
[ Laughs ] ham.
A perfect fit, sire.
Most becoming.
You look regal, dignified, sincere, masterful, noble, chival--
Uh, uh, don't, don't overdo it, Hiss.
There. That,
I believe, does it.
This crown gives me a feeling of power! Power!
Forgive me a cruel chuckle.
[ Laughing ]
Power. Hmm.
And how well King Richard's crown sits on your noble brow.
Doesn't it?
Uh, King Richard?
I've told you never to mention my brother's name!
A-A mere slip of the forked tongue, Your Majesty.
We're in this plot together, if you don't mind my saying so.
And remember, it was your idea
I hypnotized him and--
I know. And sent him off on that crazy crusade.
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ] Much to the sorrow of the Queen Mother.
Yes! Mother.
Mother always did like Richard best.
Your Highness, please don't do that.
If you don't mind my saying so, you see, you have a very loud thumb.
Hypnotism could rid you of your... psychosis... so... easily.
No! None of that!
None of that.
- Well, I was only trying to help.
- [ Laughs ]
I wonder.
Silly serpent.
- "Silly serpent"?
- Now look here.
One more hiss out of you,
[ Stammering ] Hiss, and you are walking to Nottingham.
Snakes don't walk.
They slither.
Hmpf. So there.
- [ Trumpeting ]
- [ Drumroll ]
Now what about that for luck?
It's only a circus. A peanut operation.
"Peanuts"? Why, you dunce.
That's the royal coach.
- It's Prince John himself.
- The prince?
Wait a minute.
There's a law against robbin' royalty.
- I'll catch you later.
- What?
And miss this chance to perform before royalty?
Ah! Here we go again.
Oo-de-lally!
Oo-de-lally!
Fortune-tellers!
Fortunes forecast!
Lucky charms!
Get the dope with your horoscope.
Fortune-tellers! How droll.
Uh, stop the coach.
Sire, sire, they may be bandits.
Oh, poppycock.
Female bandits?
What next? Rubbish.
[ Chuckling ]
Um, um, my dear ladies, you have my permission to kiss the royal hands.
Whichever you like, first.
Mmm! Oh!
How gracious!
- And generous.
- [ Gasping ] Sire! Sire!
- Did you see what they--
- Stop! [ Laughing ]
Stop hissing in my ear.
- [ Stammering ]
- Ah! [ Laughs ]
Hiss! Oh, you've hissed your last--
- [ Gagging ]
- hiss.
[ Gulping ]
Suspicious snake.
Masterfully done,
Your Excellency.
[ Chuckling ]
Now close your eyes... and concentrate.
Close your eyes. Tight shut.
No peeking, sire.
[ Chuckling ]
From the mists of time, come forth, spirits.
Yoo-hoo!
Okay, little fireflies.
Glow, babies, glow.
[ Robin ]
We're waiting. [ Chuckling ]
Ah, oh!
Look, sire. Look!
Oh! Incredible.
Floating spirits.
Ah, oh!
[ Chuckling ]
Naughty, naughty.
You mustn't touch, young man.
Oh, how dare you strike the royal hand.
Shh! You'll break the spell.
Just gaze into the crystal ball.
Oo-de-lally!
Oo-de-lal-- Oh!
A face appears.
[ Gasping ]
- A crown is on his noble brow.
- Oo-de-lally!
A crown!
How exciting!
His face is handsome, regal, majestic, loveable, a cuddly face.
Handsome, regal, oh!
Majestic.
Loveable. Yes, yes.
Cuddly.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, that's me to a "T."
It really is. Yes.
- I-- [ Laughs ]
- Now what?
[ Gasps, Chuckles ]
I, uh--
I see, um, your illustrious name.
I know my name!
Get on with it!
Your name will go down, down, down, in history, of course.
Yes! I knew it!
I knew it!
Do you hear that, Hiss?
Oh, you-- [ Mumbling ]
He's in the basket.
Don--
Don't forget it.
Hmm.
What have we here?
Solid-gold hubcaps.
Oo-de-lally.
The jackpot.
[ Wolf Whistle ]
- [ Laughing ]
- Robbed! I've been robbed!
Hiss! You're never around when I need you!
- Ahem. I've been robbed.
- Of course you've been robbed!
[ Robin ]
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally!
Fortunes forecast.
Lucky charms.
After them, you fools!
[ Crying ]
No, no, no, no!
I knew it. I knew it.
I just knew this would happen.
I tried to warn you, but, no.
You wouldn't listen. You just had to--
Ah, ah, ah!
Seven years' bad--
Ooh! Luck.
That's what it is.
Besides, you broke your mother's mirror.
[ Wailing ]
Mommy!
I've got a dirty thumb.
[ Chuckling ]
Well, even though Prince John... offered a huge reward for the capture of Robin Hood, that elusive rogue kept right on robbin' the rich to feed the poor.
And believe me, it's a good thing he did,
'cause what with taxes and all, the poor folks of Nottingham were starvin' to death.
Uh-oh. Here comes old bad news himself, the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham.
Every town
Has its taxes too
And the taxes is due
Do do-do do do
Well, lookie there.
[ Chuckles ]
Friar Tuck, the old do-gooder.
He's out doin' good again.
- Well, good mornin', Friar Tuck.
- Shh, Otto.
Shh! For you, Otto, from Robin Hood.
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, God bless Robin Hood.
Do do do do-do do dee do do-do
[ Friar Tuck ] It's the sheriff!
Hurry, hide it! Quick!
Here I come.
Ready or not.
Well, greetings from your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Oh, take it easy on me, Sheriff, w-what with this busted leg and all, you know.
I-I'm way behind in me work, Sheriff.
I know, Otto, but you're way behind with your taxes too.
Oh, have a heart, Sheriff.
Can't you see he's laid up?
Come on, Otto.
You'd better sit down and rest.
- [ Coins Jangling ]
- Oh, thank you. Yes.
Let me give you a hand with that leg.
Upsa-daisy.
Upsa-daisy. Bingo!
Ah, what they won't think of next.
[ Groaning ]
It smarts, don't it, Otto?
But Prince John says that taxes should hurt.
Now see here, you-- you evil, flint-hearted leech!
Now, now, now, now!
Save your sermon, preacher.
It ain't Sunday, you know.
[ Chuckles ]
Do do do-do do
They call me a slob, but I do my job
Do do do-do do
[ Children ]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Skippy
Happy birthday
To you
Well, now, sonny, that box is done up right pretty, ain't it?
Well, Mr. Sheriff, sir, it's my birthday present, sir.
It sure is.
Why don't you open it?
Oh, boy!
One whole farthing!
Have you no heart? We all scrimped and saved to give it to him.
Now that's mighty "thoughty" of you, "widder" woman.
The family that saves together pays together.
Oh, now, don't take it so hard, sonny.
Prince John wishes you a happy birthday too.
Alms, alms, alms for the poor.
Hmm. Well.
- [ Chuckles ]
- [ Gasps ]
Well, so far it's been a cheerful morning. Keep savin'!
What a dirty trick.
You poor old man.
[ Chuckles ]
Do come in.
Come in and rest yourself.
Thank ye kindly, Mother.
Thank ye.
Tell me now. Did me old ears hear someone singin' a birthday ditty?
[ Sniffling ]
Yes, sir.
And that mean old sheriff took my birthday present.
Did he now?
But be a stouthearted little lad, and don't let it get ya down.
Gee whiz!
It's Robin Hood!
Happy birthday, son!
Oh, he's so handsome, just like his reward posters.
Tell me, young man, how old are you today?
Gosh, I'm seven years old, goin' on eight.
Seven? Well, that does make you the man of the house, and I've got just the right present for you.
For me?
Gee, thanks,
Mr. Robin Hood, sir.
Hey, how do I look?
Huh?
Not much like Mr. Robin Hood.
She's right.
There is something missing.
[ Gasps ]
Of course!
There you go.
Boy, oh, boy.
Now how do I look?
[ Giggling ]
The hat's too big.
Shh!
Mind your manners.
Yes, mind your "mattles."
[ Chuckling ] Don't worry.
You'll grow into it, young man.
Oo-de-lally!
I'm gonna try it out.
Good-bye, Mr. Robin Hood!
Come again on my birthday!
[ Laughs ]
Oh, you have made his birthday a wonderful one.
How can I ever thank you?
I only wish
I could do more.
Here.
And keep your chin up.
Someday there'll be happiness again in Nottingham. You'll see.
Oh, Robin Hood.
You've risked so much to keep our hopes alive.
Bless you. Bless you.
Gee, did Robin Hood really give it to you?
Yeah, and this is his own hat too.
Gee, I'd sure like to shoot your bow and arrow.
- Let me try it, Skippy.
- Oh, no, you don't?
I'm gonna shoot it first.
You're pointin' it too high.
I'm not either.
Watch this.
Uh-oh.
Now you done it.
Right in
Prince John’s backyard.
Skippy, you can't go in there.
Yeah. Prince John will chop off your head.
Like this.
Oh, I don't care.
I gotta get my arrow.
[ Girl ] Wait a minute.
Toby might tattle on you.
- [ Skippy ] Yeah, Toby.
You gotta take the oath.
- An oath?
Put your hand on your heart and cross your eyes.
Spiders, snakes and a lizard head.
Spiders, snakes and a lizard's head.
If I tattletale,
I'll die till I'm dead.
If I tattletale,
I'll die till I'm dead.
[ Women Giggling ]
- It's your turn to serve, Marian dear.
- Are you ready, Lady Kluck?
Oh, as your lady-in-waiting,
I'm waiting.
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Laughing ]
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Klucky, that was a good shot.
You're not bad yourself, dear.
Oh, my girdle's killing me. [ Laughs ]
Where is it?
Did you lose it?
- It must be in there someplace.
- Oh, Klucky, you look so silly.
- [ Women Giggling ]
- Oh, look. There it is behind you.
Oh!
Well, hello.
- Where did you come from?
- Oh, please don't tell Prince John.
Mama said he'll chop off my head.
Oh, don't be afraid.
You've done nothing wrong.
Oh, Marian, what a bonny wee bunny.
Who does this young archer remind you of?
Well, upon my word, the notorious Robin Hood.
That's right. Only Robin Hood wears a hat like that.
Yeah, and look at this keen
Robin Hood bow.
[ Sneezes ]
Oh, Marian, don't look around, but I do believe we're surrounded.
- Oh, mercy!
- He snitched on us.
It's all right, children.
Don't be afraid. Please come here.
- Do you think it's safe?
- That's Maid Marian.
Mama said she's awful nice.
Come on!
Hey, you guys, not so fast.
Wait for me.
I told Skippy he was shooting too high.
I'm so very glad he did.
Now I get to meet all of you.
- Gee, you're very beautiful.
- Are you gonna marry Robin Hood?
Mama said you and Robin Hood are sweethearts.
Well, um--
[ Laughs ]
You see, that was several years ago before I left for London.
- Did he ever kiss you?
- Well, uh, no.
But he carved our initials on this tree.
- I remember it so well.
- You gonna have any kids?
My mom gots a lot of kids.
Oh, he's probably forgotten all about me.
Oh, not Robin Hood.
I bet he'll storm the castle gates, fight the guards, rescue ya and drag you off to Sherwood Forest.
Now just a moment there, young man.
You've forgotten Prince John.
That old Prince John don't scare me none.
I'm scared of Prince John.
He's cranky.
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
I, Prince John, challenge you to a duel. Hey, hey!
Take that! And that!
And this!
Death to tyrants!
Och! Och, och!
Slice him to pieces!
Oh, save me, my hero.
Save me.
- [ Skippy Giggling ]
- Oh! Ouch! That's not fair.
Mommy!
That's Prince John, all right.
[ Laughing ]
Yahoo!
Now I got ya!
Och, mercy! Mercy!
Oh!
Oh, he got me.
I'm dying.
- Oh!
- Did I hurt you? Huh?
No, this is the part where you drag your lady fair off to Sherwood Forest.
Come on, lady fair!
Let's go!
Oh, Robin, you're so brave and impetuous.
Oh. [ Panting ]
So this is Sherwood Forest.
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, now what are we gonna do?
Well, usually the hero gives his fair lady a kiss.
A kiss?
Oh, that's sissy stuff.
Well, if you won't, then I will.
[ Chuckling ]
- They're kissing! [ Giggling ]
- [ Laughing ]
[ Sighing ]
Ah, me. Young love.
Oh, it's a grand thing.
Oh, Klucky, surely he must know how much I still love him.
But, of course, my dear.
Believe me, someday soon, your uncle, King Richard, will have an outlaw for an in-law.
- [ Chuckling ]
- [ Chuckling ]
Oh, Klucky.
But when? When?
Oh, patience, my dear.
Patience.
Remember, absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Or forgetful.
Oh, I've been away so long.
What if he's forgotten all about me?
[ Humming ]
Hey, lover boy. How's that grub comin'? Man, I'm starved.
[ Continues Humming ]
Rob? Robin?
Robert?
- Hey!
- Hmm? What? What do you say?
Aw, forget it.
Your mind's not on food.
You're thinkin' about somebody with long eyelashes, and you're smellin' that sweet perfume.
[ Sniffing, Coughing ]
Hey, whoa!
It's boiling over!
You're burnin' the chow!
Sorry, Johnny. Guess I was thinking about Maid Marian again.
I can't help it.
I love her, Johnny.
Look, why don't you stop moonin' and mopin' around?
- Just-- Just marry the girl.
- Marry her?
You don't just walk up to a girl, hand her a bouquet and say,
"Hey, remember me? We were kids together. Will you marry me?"
[ Chuckling ]
No. It just isn't done that way.
Aw, come on, Robbie.
Climb the castle walls.
Sweep her off her feet.
Carry her off in style.
[ Sighing ] It's no use, Johnny.
I've thought it all out, and... it just wouldn't work.
Besides, what have I got to offer her?
Well, for one thing, you can't cook.
I'm serious, Johnny. She's a highborn lady of quality.
So she's got class?
So what?
I'm an outlaw, that's what.
That's no life for a lovely lady.
Always on the run.
- What kind of a future is that?
- Oh, for heaven's sake, son.
You're no outlaw.
Why, someday you'll be called a great hero.
A hero? Do you hear that, Johnny?
We've just been pardoned.
[ Laughs ] That's a gas.
We ain't even been arrested yet.
All right.
Laugh, you two rogues.
But there's gonna be a big to-do in Nottingham.
[ Slurping, Coughing ]
Well done, ain't it?
Old Prince John’s havin' a championship archery tournament tomorrow.
Archery tournament?
Ha!
Old Rob could win that standin' on his head, huh, Rob?
Thank you, Little John.
But I'm sure we're not invited.
No, but there's somebody... who'll be very disappointed if you don't come.
[ Chuckling ]
Yeah, old bushel britches, the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham.
- No, Maid Marian.
- Maid Marian?
Yeah. She-- She's gonna give a kiss to the winner.
- [ Laughing ]
- Kiss to the winner!
Oo-de-lally! Come on, Johnny!
What are we waiting for?
Wait a minute, Rob. Hold it. That place will be crawlin' with soldiers.
Aha! But, remember.
Faint hearts never won fair lady.
Fear not, my friends.
This will be my greatest performance.
[ Trumpeting ]
[ Chuckling ]
Hiss, this is a red-letter day.
A coup d'etat, to coin a Norman phrase.
Oh, yes, indeed, sire.
Your plan to capture Robin Hood in public is sheer genius.
- [ Chuckling ]
- Hiss, no one sits higher than the king.
Must I remind you, Hiss?
[ Clicking Tongue ]
Oh, oh, forgive me, sire.
I-I didn't mean to--
My trap is baited and set... and then revenge!
Ah, revenge!
Shh! Not so loud, sire.
Remember, only you and I know, and your secret is my secret.
Stop! [ Laughs ]
Stop hissing in my ear.
- Secret? What secret?
- Why, the capture of Robin Hood, sire.
That insolent blackguard.
Ooh! I'll show him who wears the crown!
I share your loathing, sire.
That scurrilous scoundrel who fooled you with that silly disguise, who dared to rob you and made you look so utterly ridiculous--
Enough!
Hiss, you deliberately dodged.
But-- B-But--
Sire, please.
Stop snivelling and hold still.
Thank you, sire.
Oh, Klucky,
I'm so excited.
But how will I recognize him?
Och, he'll let you know somehow.
That young rogue of yours is full of surprises, my dear.
There she is, Little John.
Isn't she beautiful?
Cool it, lover boy. Your heart's runnin' away with your head.
Oh, stop worrying.
This disguise would fool my own mother.
[ Chuckling ]
Yeah, but your mom ain't here.
You gotta fool old bushel britches.
- Sheriff? Your Honor?
- Yeah.
Meetin' ya face-to-face is a real treat.
A real treat.
Well, now, thank you.
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, excuse me. I gotta go win this tournament.
Hey, old Rob's not a bad actor.
But wait till he sees this scene
I lay on Prince John.
Ah! Me lord.
My esteemed royal sovereign of the realm.
The head man himself.
You're beautiful.
[ Laughs ]
He has style, eh, Hiss?
[ Speaking French ]
[ Laughing ] You took the words right out of my mouth, P.J.
"P.J."! I like that.
Do you know I do?
Hiss, put it on my luggage.
P.J.
[ Laughing ]
P.J. Yes.
Hmpf!
And you?
Who might you be, sir?
I am Sir Reginald, duke of Chutney.
And don't stick your tongue out at me, kid.
And now, Your Mightiness, allow me to lay some protocol on you.
Oh, no. Uh, forgive me, but I lose more jewels that way than--
Please sit down.
Thanks, P.J. Couldn't get a better seat than this, could you?
The royal box.
Oh! Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
What's-- Oh, excuse me, buster.
"Buster"? You, sir, have taken my seat.
[ Laughing ]
Hiss, with you around, who needs a court jester?
[ Laughing ]
Now get out there and keep your snake eyes open for you know who.
You-- You mean, I--
I'm being dismissed?
You heard His Mightiness.
Move it, creepy.
Get lost.
Begone, long one.
What cheek! "Creepy"?
"Buster"? "Long one"?
Who does that dopey duke think he is?
- Now he's up to somethin', Friar.
- Yeah! Come on!
[ Trumpeting ]
Ah, Your Ladyship.
Beggin' your pardon, but it's a great honor... to be shootin' for the favor of a lovely lady like yourself.
I hopes I win the kiss.
Oh!
Well, thank you, my thin-legged archer.
[ Chuckling ]
I wish you luck,
[ Whispering ] with all my heart.
I wonder.
Your Highness, with your royal permission, we are ready to begin.
Proceed, Captain!
The tournament of the golden arrow will now begin.
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- [ Trumpeting ]
[ Cheering ]
[ Whistles ]
Yea, Dad!
[ Crowd Booing ]
[ Crowd Cheering ]
A perfect bull's-eye.
- Well, well.
- [ Laughs ] Yeah.
That's what you call pullin' it back and lettin' it go, P.J.
I'm gonna win that golden arrow, and then I'm gonna present meself to the lovely Maid Marian and--
Listen, scissorbill, if you shoot... half as good as you blabbermouth, you're better'n Robin Hood.
Robin Hood, he says!
Wowee!
I'm tiptop, all right, but I'm not as good as he is.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
[ Laughing ]
That kid's got class, ain't he, P.J.?
Indeed he has, Reggie.
[ Laughs ]
Bravo! Uh, bravo! Yes.
Oh, um, by the way.
I hear you're havin' a bit of trouble gettin' your hands on that Robin Hood.
He's scared of me, that's what he is.
You notice he didn't show up here today.
Huh! I could spot him through them phony disguises.
It's him!
It's Robin Hood!
[ Laughs ] I just can't wait till I tell His Majesty.
[ Giggling ]
Unhand me, you--
[ Grunts ]
Please, please!
I don't drink!
Attention, everyone.
The final contestants are... the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham...
[ Crowd Booing ] and the spindle-legged stork from Devonshire.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
My dear, I suspect you favor the gangly youth, hmm?
Uh, why, yes, sire.
Well, at least he amuses me.
[ Laughs ]
Coincidently, my dear young lady, he amuses me too.
[ Laughing ]
For the final shoot-out, move the target back
30 paces.
You heard him, Nutsy!
Get goin'!
Move it, you birdbrain.
And remember what you're supposed to do.
Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.
[ Crowd Booing ]
[ Chuckling ] Well, that shot wins the golden arrow, the kiss and the whole caboodle.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Crowd Gasping ]
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- Yea! He did it, he did it, he did it!
[ Whispering ]
Archer, I commend you, and because of... your superior skill, you shall get what is coming to you.
Our royal congratulations.
Oh, thank you kindly,
Your Highness.
Meetin' you face-to-face,
Your High and Mighty, is a real treat.
Release the royal fingers.
Ah!
And now I name you... the winner, or, more appropriately,
[ Laughs ] the loser!
Seize him.
I sentence you to sudden, instant and even... immediate death!
[ Gasps ]
Oh, no! Oh!
Please.
Please, sire.
I beg of you to spare his life.
Please have mercy.
My dear emotional lady, why should I?
Because I love him,
Your Highness.
"Love him"?
And does this prisoner return your love?
Marian, my darling, I love you more than life itself.
[ Chuckles ]
Ah, young love.
Your pleas have not fallen upon a heart of stone.
But traitors to the Crown must die!
Traitor to the Crown?
That crown belongs to King Richard.
- Long live King Richard!
- [ Crowd ] Long live King Richard!
Enough! I am king!
King! King!
Ah! Off with his head!
[ Sniffling ]
Oh, no!
Stop! Executioner, stop!
Hold your ax!
Okay, big shot. Now tell them to untie my buddy, or I'll--
[ Grunts ]
Sheriff, release my buddy--
[ Grunts ]
I mean, release the prisoner!
Untie the prisoner?
You heard what he said, bushel britches.
Sheriff, I make the rules, and since I am the head man--
Not so hard, you mean thing.
Let him go, for heaven's sakes!
Let him go!
Yee-hee!
Love conquers all!
[ Cheering ]
I owe my life to you, my darling.
I couldn't have lived without you, Robin.
There's somethin' funny goin' on around here.
Now, P.J., tell my pal to kiss Maid Marian, or I've just found a new pincushion.
Why, you!
Kill him!
Don't stand there! Kill him!
Don't hurt me! No, no!
Don't hurt me! Help! Help!
Kill him!
Run for it, lassie!
This is no place for a lady!
[ Screaming ]
Take that, you scoundrel.
Help! Robin, help!
Marian, my love, will you marry me?
Oh, darling, I thought you'd never ask me.
But you could have chosen a more romantic setting.
- And for our honeymoon, London--
- Yes!
- Normandy! Sunny Spain!
- Yes! Why not?
Ooh, what a main event this is.
- [ John Laughing ]
- [ Lady Kluck Shouting ]
What a beautiful brawl.
Hey! Who's drivin' this flyin' umbrella?
- We'll have six children.
- Six?
Oh, a dozen at least.
[ Chuckling ]
Take that!
Attention, everyone.
[ Horn Blaring ]
[ Trumpeting ]
Stop the girl!
- Ooh!
- Take that, you scurvy knave!
Seize the fat one!
- [ Whistles ]
- [ Cheering ]
Yahoo!
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- Long live King Richard!
Yee-hoo!
Hiss! You're never around when I need you!
[ Echoing ] Coming. Coming.
[ Laughs ]
For I'm a jolly good fellow
For I'm a jolly good--
[ Laughs ]
Oh! Oh, there you are, old boy!
P.J., you won't believe this, but the stork is really Robin Hood.
Robin Hood.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Screaming ]
Get out of that if you can.
[ Woman ]
Love It seems like only yesterday
You were just a child at play
Now you're all grown up
Inside of me
Oh, how fast those moments flee
Once we watched a lazy world go by
Now the days seem to fly
Life is brief
But when it's gone
Love goes on and on
[ Harmonizing ]
Love will live
Love will last
Love goes on
And on and on
Once we watched a lazy world go by
Now the days seem to fly
Life is brief
But when it's gone
Love goes on and on
Oh, Robin, what a beautiful night.
I wish it would never end.
[ Friar Tuck ]
Surprise!
- Long live Robin Hood!
- [ Sexton ] Hooray!
- And long live Maid Marian!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Hear, hear! Bravo! Bravo!
Hooray!
And down with that scurvy Prince John!
Yeah.
Oh, the world will sing of an English king a thousand years from now
And not because he passed some laws or had that lofty brow
While bonny good King Richard leads the great crusade he's on
We'll all have to slave away for that good-for-nothin' John
Incredible as he is inept
Whenever the history books are kept
They'll call him the phony king of England
A pox on that phony king of England
[ Friar Tuck Laughing ]
[ All Laughing ]
He sits alone on the giant throne pretendin' he's the king
A little tyke who's rather like a puppet on a string
And he throws an angry tantrum if he cannot have his way
And then he calls for Mom while he's suckin' his thumb.
You see, he doesn't wanna play.
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the Worst
Apox on that phony king of England
Lay that country on me babe
Come on, Johnny.
Go, laddie, go!
Oh, oh, oooh!
While he taxes us to pieces and he robs us of our bread
King Richard's crown keeps slippin' down around that pointed head
Ah, but while there is a merry man in Robin's wily pack
We'll find a way to make him pay and steal our money back
A minute before he knows we're there
- [ Stops ]
- Old Rob'll snatch his underwear.
- [ All Laughing ]
- [ Resumes ]
The breezy and uneasy king of England
The snivelin', grovelin'
Measly, weaselly
Blabberin', jabberin'
Jibberin', jabberin'
Plunderin', plottin'
Wheelin', dealin'
Prince John
That phony king of England
Yeah
He throws an angry tantrum if he cannot have his way
He calls for Mom and sucks his thumb and doesn't want to play
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the Worst
How about that?
That's P.J. to a "T." Let me try.
Let me try. [ Clears Throat ]
[ Warming Up ]
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the Worst
The fabulous, marvelous, merciful, chivalrous--
Oh, you got it all wrong, Hiss.
- The snivelin', grovelin', weaselly, measly--
- Enough!
But-But, sire, it's a big hit.
The whole village is singin' it.
Oh, they are, are they?
Well, they'll be singing a different tune.
Double the taxes!
Triple the taxes!
Squeeze every last drop... out of those insolent, musical peasants!
[ Allan-a-Dale ]
Man, oh, man.
- Prince John sure made good his threat,
- [ Thunderclap ] and his helpless subjects paid dearly... for his humiliation, believe me.
Taxes, taxes, taxes.
Why, he taxed the heart and soul out of the poor people of Nottingham.
- [ Guitar ]
- And if you couldn't pay your taxes, you went to jail.
Yep, I'm in here too.
Nottingham was in deep trouble.
Every town
Has its ups and downs
Sometimes ups
Outnumber the downs
But not in Nottingham
I'm inclined to believe
If we weren't so down
We'd up and leave
We'd up and fly
If we had wings for flyin'
Can't you see the tears we're cryin'
Can't there be some happiness
For me
Not in Nottingham
Friar Tuck, [ Sighs ]
I don't think anyone is coming.
You're right, Sexton, but maybe the sound of this church bell... will bring those poor people some comfort.
We must do what we can to keep their hopes alive.
Oh, how can there be any hope with that tyrant Prince John... taxing the heart and soul out of the poor people?
Yes, those poor people.
Look, our poor box is like our church-- empty.
Friar Tuck, we've saved this.
It's not much, but please take it for the poor.
Your last farthing?
Aw, little sister, no one can give more than that.
Bless you both.
Oh, we were just saving it for a rainy day.
Well, it's rainin' now.
- [ Chuckles ] Things can't get worse.
- [ Sheriff ] Howdy, Friar.
- Well, it looks like
I dropped by just in time.
- [ Organ Stops ]
- What does that big-bellied bully want?
- Father, shh.
Hmm. Well, what have we got here?
Now, just a minute,
Sheriff!
Th- Th- That's the poor box!
It sure is, and I'll just take it for poor Prince John.
Every little bit helps.
Oooh, you put that back!
And His Majesty also blesses you, little sister.
You thievin' scoundrel!
Now, take it easy, Friar.
I'm just doin' my duty.
Collectin' taxes for that arrogant, greedy, ruthless, no-good Prince John?
Listen, Friar, you're mighty preachy, and you're gonna preach your neck right into a hangman's noose.
Get out of my church!
- Out! Out! Out! Out!
- Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Oh, dear me.
You want taxes?
- I'll give you taxes!
- Ow!
Give it to him! Give it to him!
Give it to him, Friar!
You're under arrest for high treason to the crown.
Oh, no!
Oh, there, there, Mother.
[ Allan-a-Dale ]
Every town
Has its ups and downs
Sometimes ups
Outnumber the downs
But not in Nottingham
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Clears Throat ]
Sire, if I may-- may venture an opinion, you're not your usual cheerful, genial self today.
I-I-I know. I know.
You haven't counted your money for days, hmm?
It always makes you so happy.
[ Clears Throat ]
Sire, taxes are pouring in, the jail is full.
And, oh,
I have good news, sire.
- Friar Tuck is in jail.
- Friar Tuck?
It's Robin Hood I want, you idiot!
I'd give all my gold if I could just get my hands--
Did you say Friar Tuck?
Did I?
Y-Y-Yes, I did.
Ah!
Hiss, I have it!
I'll use that fat friar as bait to trap Robin Hood.
Another trap?
Yes, yes, you stupid serpent.
Friar Tuck will be led to the gallows in the village square, don't you see?
B-B-But, sire, hang Friar Tuck, a man of the church?
Yes, my reluctant reptile.
And when our elusive hero tries to rescue... the corpulent cleric,
[ Laughing ] my men will be ready.
[ Thunderclap ]
Well, Trigger, everything's rigged up and all set.
Yep, it's one of the prettiest scaffolds you ever built, Sheriff.
Sheriff, don't you reckon we oughta give that there trapdoor a test?
[ Groans ]
Criminently. Now I know why your mama called you "Nutsy."
Alms. Alms for the poor.
Do me old ears hear the melodious voice... of the sheriff?
That's right, old man.
What be going on here?
We're gonna hang Friar Tuck.
No! Hang Friar--
Hang Friar Tuck?
You betcha. At dawn.
And maybe it'll even be a double hangin'.
Shh, shh.
Dummy up, you dummy.
A double hangin', eh?
Who'll be the other one who gets the rope?
Sheriff, he's gettin' too all-fired nosy.
Oh, I didn't mean nothin'.
But, um, couldn't there be trouble... if Robin Hood showed up?
Well, wouldn't you know,
Sheriff, he guessed it.
Nutsy, button your beak.
Ah, no need to worry.
The sheriff be too crafty, too clever and too smart... for the likes of him, says I.
[ Sheriff ]
Ya hear that, Nutsy?
For bein' blind, he sure knows a good man... when he sees one, says I.
Sheriff,
I still got a feelin'... that that snoopy old codger knows too much.
Oh, shut up, Trigger.
He's just a harmless old blind beggar.
Alms.
Alms for the poor.
Alms.
Alms for the poor.
Rob, we can't let 'em hang Friar Tuck.
A jailbreak tonight is the only chance he's got.
A jailbreak? There ain't no way you can get him.
We've got to, Johnny, or Friar Tuck dies at dawn.
1:00, and all's well!
[ Clock Chiming Three Times ]
[ Snorts, Smacking Gums ]
Nutsy, you'd better set your brains ahead a couple of hours.
Yes, sir. Uh, does that there mean addin' or subtractin'?
- Oh, let's forget it.
- Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.
Nutsy, how can I sleep with you yelling
"All's well" all the time here?
Sheriff, everything ain't "all's well."
I got a feelin' in my bones there's gonna be a jailbreak any minute.
Criminently, Trigger!
Point that peashooter the other way.
Don't you worry none, Sheriff.
The safety's on Old Betsy.
What in tarnation you tryin' to do,
- you birdbrain?
- Just doin' my duty, Sheriff.
You and that itchy trigger finger of yours.
[ Muffled Scream ]
- Hey, did you hear that?
- Sure did, Trigger.
There's something funny going on around here. Come on.
You cover me.
Wait a minute.
Is the safety on Old Betsy?
- You bet it is, Sheriff.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
You go first.
All right, you in there, come out with your hands up.
Yeah, reach for the sky.
- Just you watch this
"preformance", partner.
- Be careful, Rob.
Jehoshaphat, Trigger.
Put that peashooter down.
Aw, shucks, Trigger, it's only Nutsy.
And criminently, get back to your patrol.
- On the double. Get!
- I'm a-gettin'.
That Trigger.
He's gettin' everybody edgy.
Nothing's gonna happen.
That fat friar... is gonna dangle from the gallows come daybreak.
Sheriff, why don't you just sit yourself down here kind of cozy-like?
Well, thank you, Nutsy.
Just close your sleepy little eyeballs.
The sandman's a-comin'.
[ Snoring ]
Why don't you, uh, let me loosen that belt?
Rock-a-bye, Sheriff
Just you relax
[ Snoring ]
- [ Humming ]
- [ Humming Along ]
[ Snoring Resumes ]
- [ Humming ]
- [ Clicks ]
[ Snorts ]
Oh, Nutsy, that's mighty sweet.
Sing it one more time, would you?
Rock-a-bye, Sheriff
Just you relax
[ Humming ]
[ Snoring Resumes ]
Wait a minute!
Jailbreak! Jailbreak!
I heard it! I heard it, Sheriff!
The door! The door!
- Now, for the last time, no more false alarms.
- Ow!
Now, you release Friar Tuck and the others... and I'll drop in on the royal treasury.
Oh, Little John, it can't be!
- Shh, quiet. We're bustin' out of here.
- Thank God.
My prayers have been answered.
- I'm ready. Where's the bad guys?
- Take it easy, son.
- [ Prince John Snoring ]
- [ Hiss Hissing ]
[ Prince John ]
Robin Hood!
[ Laughing ]
I'll get even. I'll get--
[ Prince John Sighing ]
[ Snorts, Grumbles ]
[ Snoring ]
[ High-Pitched Moaning ]
[ High-Pitched Moaning ]
[ Snoring ]
It's Robin Hood I--
I want.
[ Laughing Continues ]
[ Muttering ]
[ Laughing ]
Praise the Lord and pass the tax rebate!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Come on. Follow me.
Now, Sheriff--
Now, don't get your dander up, but I still got a feelin' that--
Friar, get goin'.
Hurry.
[ Clock Chiming Four Times ]
[ Moans ]
[ Snorts, Mutters ]
[ Shuddering ]
[ Whimpering ]
[ Screaming ]
Ooo-oooh!
Guards! Guards!
My gold!
Oh, no, no, no.
They're getting away with my gold.
Guards! Guards!
To the jail!
Rhinos, halt!
Stop! Desist!
[ Screaming ]
Everybody, this way!
That's all of them.
Get going.
This ain't no hayride.
Let's move it out of here. Ho-ooo!
On to Sherwood Forest!
Stop! My baby!
Mama, Mama, wait for me.
- We got him now!
- Keep going. Don't worry about me.
This time, we got him for sure.
Shoot him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Come on, Rob. Come on.
He's just gotta make it.
No! No. No.
Hiss, he's finished!
Done for!
La, la, la
[ Laughing ]
He's gonna make it, isn't he, Little John?
Hey, what's that?
Little John, look it!
Look it!
Hey, what the--
[ Laughs ]
Oh, man, did you have me worried, Rob.
I thought you were long gone.
Ah, not Robin Hood.
He could've swum twice that far, huh, Mr. Robin Hood, sir?
Look, Friar! Look!
He's made it. He got away again.
A pox on that phony King of England!
Oo-de-lally!
- Oo-de-lally!
- Oh, no. It's so miserably unfair.
Well, I tried to tell you, but, no, no, no, you wouldn't listen.
Your traps never work, and look what you've done to your mother's castle.
[ Screaming ]
Mommy!
- [ Screams ] Sire, no!
- You cowardly cobra!
Please! Oh, no!
Procrastinating python!
- Aggravating asp!
- Save me!
You eel in snake's clothing!
Help!
He's gone stark raving mad!
[ Echoing ]
[ Whistling ]
You know, I thought we'd never get rid of those two rascals, but lucky for us folks,
King Richard returned, and, well, he just straightened everything out.
[ Whimpering ]
Oooh. Aaah.
[ Church Bells Chiming ]
Say, we'd better get over to the church.
Sounds like somebody's gettin' hitched.
[ All ]
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live King Richard!
Oh, Friar Tuck, it appears that I now have an outlaw for an in-law.
Yes, not bad.
Gee, Skippy, how come you're goin'?
Well, Robin Hood's gonna have kids, so somebody's gotta keep their eye on things.
Ho-ooo!
Ohhh.
I've never been so happy.
Hey, here come the bride,
Trigger.
Present arms!
[ Allan-a-Dale Chuckles ] Well, folks, that's the way it really happened.
Love goes on and on
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
My story begins in London.
Not so very long ago.
And yet so much has happened since then,
that it seems more like an eternity.
At that time, I lived with my pet
in a bachelor flat just off Regent's Park.
It was a beautiful spring day,
a tedious time of the year for bachelors.
Oh. That's my pet, Roger.
Roger Radcliffe, a musician of sorts.
No. No, I'm the one with the spots.
My name's Pongo.
And you know, as far as I could see,
the old notion that a bachelor's life was so glamorous
and carefree was all nonsense.
It was downright dull.
It was plain to see that my old pet needed someone.
But if it were left up to Roger, we'd be bachelors forever.
He was married to his work. Writing songs.
Songs about romance, of all things,
something he knew absolutely nothing about.
Oh, he's intelligent enough, as humans go.
And I think you could say that Roger is a rather handsome animal in his way.
I could see no reason why my pet didn't deserve an attractive mate.
At least, I was determined to do my best.
Of course, dogs are a pretty poor judge of human beauty.
But I had a rough idea of what to look for.
Hmm. Unusual breed.
Very unusual.
Oh, surely not.
Well, now, what have we here?
Hmm.
Well, a little too short-coupled.
Nope.
I say... Oh, well I do say!
Now, there's a fancy breed.
Hmm... Perhaps a little too fancy.
Yes. That's much too fancy.
Too old.
Too young.
It was a problem. A real problem.
Well, now that's a bit more like it!
The most beautiful creature on four legs.
Oh, now, if only the girl...
Well! She's very lovely, too.
It was almost too good to be true.
I'd never find another pair like that, not if I looked for 100 years.
Ah, they're heading for the park.
A perfect meeting place, if I could only arrange it.
Uh-oh. But Roger never stopped work till after 5:00.
That would be too late.
After 5:00 already.
Fancy that.
All right, Pongo. All right, boy.
Pongo, boy, take it easy!
What's all the hurry?
Pongo, boy, slow down.
I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.
Then suddenly, I spotted them.
It was a perfect situation if I planned it right.
I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.
He'd settle on the grass, puff his pipe and that would be it.
No, it was all up to me.
Well...
At first I had no particular plan,
just anything to attract attention.
You know, stir things up a bit.
Pongo, you silly old thing! Come on.
Come on, let's have it, boy.
Pongo!
Pongo!
For a while, it seemed to work.
At least they had seen one another.
Things were going along first-rate.
But for some strange reason they left!
Come on, you old renegade.
We're going home.
But I wasn't giving up.
I was determined that, somehow, they just had to meet.
- Oh!
- Oh!
I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry. Please excuse me.
- I must say, what on earth!
- Oh, dear!
Oh, really. Good heavens. Of all the...
- Oh!
- Ah!
Oh, my new spring suit and my new hat!
I'm terribly sorry.
Please let me help you.
I'm so sorry. Pongo, you...
I don't know what's come over him.
I'm terribly sorry. He's never acted this way before.
Never mind. Never mind.
Please, just go away.
You've done enough.
Please? Oh.
Oh, I say. Here, take mine.
Oh.
Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
For the first six months or so,
we lived in a small house near the park,
a modest little place,
but just right for two couples who were just starting out.
Perdita, darling, are you all right?
Oh, of course, dear.
After all, dogs were having puppies long before our time.
Oh, that's Nanny, a wonderful cook and housekeeper.
She's such a kind, understanding soul.
You know,
at times she seems almost canine.
Roger, dear, tea time.
Tea time!
Be down in a minute
Do you like my new song?
- Such clever lyrics.
- Melody first, my dear.
And then the lyrics, hmm?
Oh, Pongo, it's her.
It's that devil woman.
Oh, must be Cruella, your dearly devoted old school mate.
Cruella De Vil.
That's it!
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Oh, Roger.
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Oh!
Cruella
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Roger, she'll hear you.
Look out for Cruella De Vil
Let her in, Nanny.
- Anita, darling!
- How are you?
Miserable as usual.
Perfectly wretched!
Where are they? Where are they?
For heaven sakes, where are they?
- Who, Cruella?
- The puppies! The puppies.
No time for games. Where are the little brutes?
It'll be at least three weeks.
No rushing these things.
Anita, you're such a wit.
Here, dog, here.
Here, dog.
Cruella, isn't that a new fur coat?
My only true love, darling.
I live for furs. I worship furs!
After all, is there a woman in this wretched world who doesn't?
Oh, I'd like a nice fur, but there are many other things...
Sweet, simple Anita.
I know, I know!
This horrid little house is your dream castle.
And poor Roger is your bold and fearless Sir Galahad!
Oh, Cruella.
Then of course you have your little spotted friends.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I must say, such perfectly beautiful coats.
- Won't you have some tea?
- I've got to run.
Let me know when the puppies arrive.
- You will, won't you, dear?
- Yes, Cruella.
Don't forget, it's a promise.
See you in three weeks. Cheerio.
Cheerio, darling.
Oh!
At first you think
Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realise
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
You're no help.
This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella
Cruella De Vil
Roger, you are an idiot!
- Perdy?
- That witch. That devil woman.
She wants our puppies.
That's all she's after.
Don't worry, Perdy.
They're on to her.
Nothing's going to happen to our puppies.
What does she want with them?
She can't possibly love them.
Oh, Pongo.
I was so happy at first, but now I...
Oh, I...
I wish we weren't having any.
Poor Perdita. Of course, she had no choice.
The puppies arrived right on schedule,
one wild and stormy night in October.
Steady, boy.
The puppies are here!
Oh, the puppies are here!
How many?
- Eight.
- Eight?
By George, Pongo! Eight puppies.
Ten.
- Eleven.
- Eleven.
Eleven? Eleven puppies, Pongo, boy.
Wait a minute now, wait a minute, 13!
No, no, no. Fourteen.
- Oh, 15!
- Fifteen?
And the mother's doing fine, love.
You ducky thing, you.
Fifteen puppies?
Why, Pongo, that's marvellous!
It's fabulous!
Why, you old rascal!
Fourteen.
Just 14.
We lost one.
Oh, poor little thing.
Oh, Pongo, boy.
It's just one of those things.
And yet...
And yet I wonder.
Look, Pongo.
Anita!
Nanny. Fifteen!
We still have 15!
Oh, Roger, he's all right!
Thank heaven.
See? He's just as good as new.
Can you imagine, Roger, 15 puppies!
Fifteen. Fifteen puppies!
How marvellous.
How marvellous, how perfectly... Ugh!
The devil take it. They're mongrels, no spots!
No spots at all. What a horrid little white rat.
They're not mongrels!
They'll get their spots.
Just wait and see.
That's right. They'll have their spots in a few weeks.
Oh, well, in that case I'll take them all. The whole litter.
Just name your price, dear.
I'm afraid we can't give them up.
- Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous.
You can't afford to keep them.
You can scarcely afford to feed yourselves.
I'm sure we'll get along.
Yes, I know. I know!
Roger's... Roger's songs!
Enough of this nonsense. I'll pay you twice what they're worth.
Come now, I'm being more than generous.
Blast this pen.
Blast this wretched, wretched pen! Ah!
When can the puppies leave their mother?
Two weeks? Three weeks?
Never.
- What?
- We're not selling the puppies.
Not a single one.
Do you understand?
Anita, is he serious?
I really don't know Roger.
- Cruella, he seems...
- Surely he must be joking!
No, no, no. I mean it.
You're, you're not getting one. Not one.
And that's final.
Why, you horrid man!
You... You...
All right, keep the little beasts for all I care.
Do as you like with them.
Drown them!
But I warn you, Anita, We're through.
I'm through with all of you!
I'll get even. Just wait.
You'll be sorry, you fools!
You idiots!
Oh, Roger! You were magnificent, darling.
He was a bloomin' hero, ma'am!
Indeed he was. A bloomin' hero!
Perdy? Perdy, darling?
We're keeping the puppies, every single one of them.
My ol' pet Roger, he told that devil woman off.
He told her off, Perdy. She's gone.
- Darling, she's gone for good.
- Oh, Pongo.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
Go get him, Thunder.
After him, boy.
He'll get that dirty ol' horse thief.
Old Thunderbolt's the greatest dog in the whole world.
He's even better than Dad.
No dog's better than Dad.
What's he going to do, Dad?
Shh. Shh. Let's just wait and see.
Look at him run, the old coward.
That old dirty Dawson!
The yellow-livered old skunk!
I'd like to tear his gizzard out.
Why, Patch, where did you ever hear such talk?
Certainly not from your mother.
- Watch out, Thunder.
- Don't worry, Penny.
He'll get that yellow-livered...
Well, he'll get him, all right.
Lucky, get down. We can't see. Get down.
Mother, make him get down.
Come on, Lucky. Down, dear.
Missed him. Missed him by a mile.
I'm hungry, mother. I'm hungry.
Now, Rolly, you've just had your dinner.
But I am, just the same.
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole elephant.
Shh!
There he is, behind that rock.
Oh, dear. He shot poor Thunder.
He missed him. Ol' Thunder's pretending, I think.
See? What did I tell you?
That's one of his tricks.
Lucky, get down.
I'm hungry, Mother. I really am.
Don't miss next week's episode. Who will triumph?
Ol' Thunder always wins!
And speaking of champions, friends,
Kanine Krunchies is the champion of all dog biscuits.
Kanine Krunchies can't be beat
They make each meal a special treat
Happy dogs are those who eat nutritious Kanine Krunchies
Perdy, we better get these little nippers off to bed if we're going for a W-A-L-K.
- We want to go, too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?
We never get to go.
Come along, children. Bedtime.
But we're not a... bit sleepy.
We want to go for a walk in the park.
- Dad, can we?
- Better do as your mother says.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13...
I'm not sleepy. I'm hungry.
Fourteen.
Hmm?
So do what all the smart dogs do
And you'll feel great the whole day through
You can be a champion, too if you eat Kanine Krunchies
Remember, friends, just send five...
Lucky, you little rascal, let's go.
There they go, Horace, me lad, out for their evening constitutional.
Oh. A lovely pair of turtledoves.
Around the Johnny Horner and off to the park.
Yeah, I don't like it, Jasper.
One more pinch and they'll throw the keys away.
Oh, come off it, Horace. We're getting plenty of boodle.
Yes, but I've been thinkin'.
You've been thinkin'?
I warned you about thinkin'.
I've got the knob for this job, so let's get on with it.
Ah, nobody home but the little ol' cook.
You just leave her to ol' Jasper.
He can handle her real diplomatic-like.
Yeah, but I still don't like it.
Here, here. Patch, you settle down.
Oh, dear.
Go to sleep now.
Close your little eyes.
That's a good little one.
Who do you suppose?
Good evening, ma'am.
We're here to inspect the wiring and the switches.
- We're from the gas company.
- Electric, electric.
Electric company.
But we didn't call for any inspection.
Yes, I know. See, there's a new act just been passed in Parliament.
Under the heading of the "Defence of the
Realm Act." Article four, section 29.
It's a law. And it's for your own safety, ma'am.
I don't care what Parliament
Realm or whatever it is says.
You're not coming in here, not with the Mister and Missus gone.
Oh, now. Come off it, Ducky.
We got no time to palaver.
We got a job to do. Excuse me!
What's the matter with you two?
You got cloth ears? I said you're not coming in here!
- Oh!
- Oh-ho-ho!
She's a regular little tartar, ain't she, Horace?
Don't you dare go up there, you big, long-legged lummox!
Now I mean it.
If you don't get out of this house,
I'll call the police, I will.
Now be off with you, you big weasel!
Now you've been gone and done it.
You've cut me to the quick, lady.
Why, I wouldn't stay here if you asked me.
Not even for a cup of tea.
Oy! Horace, me lad, I've got a sneaky suspicion we're not welcome here.
Pack up. We're leaving.
Sharp's the word and quick's the action.
Let me out! Help!
I'll call the police. Help!
Goodnight, Ducky. Ta-ta!
Those good-for-nothing hoodlums!
Electric company. Hmph!
Nothing but common sneak thieves.
I'll bet they made off with the good silver.
Why, I'll bet they took every last...
The puppies!
The puppies! They're gone!
Patch? Lucky? Rolly?
Oh! They took the puppies!
Oh, whatever will I do?
Those scoundrels!
They stole the puppies.
Police? Help! The puppies.
Police! Somebody help me!
Help! Help! Help!
"Dognapping!" Tsk-tsk. Can you imagine such a thing?
"15 puppies stolen." They are darling little things.
Anita and her...
And her bashful Beethoven!
Pipe and all!
Oh, Roger, you are a fool!
Hello?
Jasper! Jasper, you idiot!
How dare you call here?
We don't want no more of this, we want our boodle!
We'll settle for half!
Not one shilling 'till the job's done.
- Jasper! Jasper!
- Do you understand?
It's in the blinkin' papers, pictures and all!
Hang the papers! It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
- I don't like it.
- Shut up, you idiot!
What?
Not you, miss. I mean Horace!
Why, you imbecile!
Maybe Scotland Yard.
Maybe they found something.
Hello, Inspector?
- Is Anita there?
- Who?
- Anita!
- It's for you.
- Hello?
- Anita, darling.
- Oh. Cruella.
- Oh, Anita.
What a dreadful thing.
I just saw the papers.
I couldn't believe it.
Yes, Cruella. It was quite a shock.
- Is she calling to confess?
- Roger, please!
She's a sly one.
We're doing everything possible.
- Have you called the police?
- Yes, Scotland Yard.
- But I'm afraid...
- Where are they?
You idiot!
- Anita!
- Sorry, Cruella.
Yes. If there's any news, we'll let you know.
Thank you, Cruella.
Roger, I admit she's eccentric, but she's not a thief.
She's still number one suspect in my book!
She's been investigated by Scotland Yard.
- What more do you want?
- I don't know, darling.
I don't know.
Oh, Rog. What'll we do?
What'll we do?
Perdy, I'm afraid it's all up to us.
Oh, Pongo. Isn't there any hope?
Well, yes. There's the twilight bark.
The twilight bark? That's only a gossip chain.
Darling, it's the very fastest way to send news.
If our puppies are anywhere in the city, the London dogs will know.
We'll send the word tonight when our pets take us for a walk in the park.
There's no one out tonight.
I'm afraid it's too cold.
We've got to keep trying, Perdy.
Perdy, we're in luck!
It's the Great Dane at Hampstead.
Pongo. Quiet, boy!
Do you want to stir up the whole neighbourhood? Come on. Pongo.
- Perdy, come on!
- Let's go.
Pongo, you old idiot!
Come on, now. We're going home!
What is it, Danny?
Who's on the telegraph?
It's Pongo, Regent's Park!
It's an all-dog alert.
What's it all about? What's the word?
Tell me, Danny! Tell me, tell me!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Well, now... Hmm, that is something.
What, Danny? What's something?
Fifteen Dalmatian puppies, stolen!
Have they called the police?
Scotland Yard?
The humans tried everything.
Now it's up to us dogs and the twilight bark.
I'll sound the alert!
Prissy, come in here!
Coco!
Be quiet now!
Ah, shut up!
Quiet!
Will you be quiet!
Towser, what's going on?
What is it? What's all the gossip?
'Tain't no gossip, Lucy. It be all the way from London.
- You don't say!
- Fifteen puppies stolen.
There's no puppies around here, not since Nellie's last litter.
And they're all grown up.
Well, then, we'd best send the word along.
It be up to me to reach the Colonel!
He be the only one in barking range.
You'll never reach him at this hour!
Well, I can try!
I'll bark all night if I have to.
Hmm...
Hmm... Sounds like old Towser.
It's an alert. Sergeant!
Sergeant Tibs! I say, Sergeant!
Oh, yes, Captain!
Barking signal. It's an alert.
Report to the Colonel at once.
Yes, sir. Right-o, sir.
Right away, sir!
Colonel?
I say, Colonel!
Colonel, sir? Colonel?
- Colonel?
- What? Who goes there?
Sergeant Tibs reporting, sir.
- Tibs? Tibs? Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs!
- Colonel, sir...
Look here, Tibs. What's the idea of barging in at this hour?
- But Colonel...
- Hold on, Sergeant.
You hear that?
- Sounds like an alert.
- Yes, Colonel.
We'd better look into it.
Come along, on the double.
Right-o, sir.
It's old Towser down at Withermarsh, sir.
By Jove, yes! So it is. Hmm.
Well, I'll see what he wants. it be the Colonel.
The old boy himself!
He wants the message.
You'd better make it loud and clear or he'll never get it.
One long howl, two short.
- One yip and a woof.
- Two yips, sir.
- What's the word, Colonel?
- It's from London.
Then it must be important.
Yes, yes, I'll get the rest of it.
Sounds like a number.
Three fives are 13...
That's 15, sir.
Fifteen, of course 15.
Yes, dot, spot, spotted puddings, poodles...
No, no, puddles.
Puddles, sir?
Fifteen spotted puddles stolen.
Oh, balderdash.
Better double check it, Colonel.
Oh, yes, yes, I suppose I better.
Two woofs, one yip and a woof.
It sounds like puppies, sir.
Of course, puppies.
Colonel, Colonel, sir,
I just remembered.
Two nights past I heard puppy barking over at Hell Hall.
You mean the old De Vil place?
Nonsense, Tibs! No one's lived there for years.
Hold on! There's smoke coming from the chimney!
By Jove, that's strange, strange indeed.
I suppose we'd better investigate.
I'll send word for ol'
Towser to stand by.
Please stand by.
- What's he mean by that?
- I don't know.
Oh, maybe the ol' boy's found something!
Oh, I do hope so.
They say the ol' place is haunted or bewitched or some such fiddle-faddle.
Fiddle-faddle and rot, sir.
Just the same, use extreme caution.
No telling what sort of hocus-pocus you might run into.
Blast it all, Tibs.
On the double, man.
- On the double.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Psst!
- Rover. Spotty.
- Hmm. What?
Are you one of the
15 stolen puppies?
No, we're not stolen.
We're bought and paid for.
There's 99 of us all together.
Ninety-nine!
How 'bout that bunch of little ones?
They have names and collars.
They're not from the pet shops.
- Fifteen of 'em.
- We never counted them.
They're over there by the TV.
- I'd better count 'em.
- Watch out for the Baduns.
Baduns?
Those two blokes,
Horace and Jasper.
They're mean ones, they are.
Hey, look, Horace!
Watch me pot His Lordship smack on the conk.
How's that for calling 'em, eh?
One, two,
- three, four, five, six...
- Hey, Jasper.
Come on, now, give us a swig, just a short one.
Now, Horace, this hogwash ain't fit for a fancy bloke like yourself.
Besides, you'd get crumbs in it, you cabbage head!
All right.
Guzzle the whole works. I hope it gives you collywobbles, that's what.
Hey, Jasper. Did you...
Let me see. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...
Hey, get down, you runt!
And stay down!
Go on, get out of here or I'll black your other peeper.
Where was I? Nine...
Nine, three more.
Twelve and... One, two, three. That's 15!
They're the ones!
Blimey!
What the...
Horace, look what we got! A tabby cat!
How'd you like a tabby cat stew?
Or a cat casserole?
À la mode.
- What is it, Pongo? What is it?
- Shh. It's the Great Dane.
He has news for us. He'll meet us at Primrose Hill.
- How'll we get out?
- Uh, the back bedroom window.
It's always open a wee bit. Come on.
Pongos, you've made it. Good.
- What's the word? What's the news?
- Have they found our puppies?
They've been located somewhere north of here,
- in Suffolk.
- Oh, thank heaven.
- Can you leave tonight?
- We can leave right away.
I'll go along as far as Camden
Road and give you instructions.
When you reach Withermarsh, contact old Towser.
He'll direct you to the Colonel and the Colonel will take you to your puppies at the De Vil place.
- De Vil!
- The De Vil place!
Oh, Pongo, it was her!
Oh, someone you know?
Sorry, sir. There's no time to explain.
Oh, I hope we're not too late.
Good luck, Pongos.
If you lose your way, contact the barking chain.
They'll be standing by!
Any news, Colonel?
Not a blasted thing.
They're lost or captured, or something or other.
- Who knows what.
- Colonel, here comes a car.
Come now, Tibs.
Don't be ridiculous.
- They wouldn't be driving.
- Yes, I know, sir.
But it's heading for Hell Hall.
It's stopping at the gate!
It is? Blast it all!
Better see what's up.
- On the double, man. On the double!
- Yes, sir.
Take over, Captain.
Right-o, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr Simpkins.
The answer's no, no, no.
Six down, four to go.
I've got no time to argue.
It's got to be done tonight.
It must be a yes or no question, Inspector.
Do you understand? Tonight!
But they ain't big enough.
You couldn't get half a dozen coats out of the whole caboodle.
Coats! Dog-skin coats?
Then we'll settle for half a dozen! We can't wait.
The police are everywhere.
I want the job done tonight!
How're we gonna do it?
Any way you like. Poison them, drown them.
Bash them in the head.
You got any chloroform?
- Not a drop.
- And no ether, ei-ther.
Eye-ther!
I don't care how you kill the little beasts, but do it, and do it now!
Aw, please, miss. Have pity.
Can't we see the rest of the show first?
We want to see What's My Crime?
Listen, you idiots!
I'll be back in the morning.
The job better be done, or I'll call the police!
Do you understand?
I think she means it.
Ah... We'll get on with it, as soon as the show's over.
Will you please sign in, sir?
You'd better get out of here if you want to save your skins.
- But how?
- Shh.
There's a hole in the wall there by the door.
Come on, shake a leg.
Psst! Kids, follow me.
Hey, Jasper, look!
It's old Meathead.
Yeah, what do you know, old Meathead Fauncewater.
Come on, don't crowd.
One at a time. One at a time!
For our last contestant,
meet Mr Percival Fauncewater.
If the panel fails to guess your unusual crime in ten questions,
you will receive two weeks vacation at a seaside resort,
all expenses paid.
That is, after you've paid your debt to society.
Who will take the first question? Inspector?
Mr Fauncewater, could your crime be classified as larceny?
- A theft, burglary?
- Straighten out!
Form a queue, along the wall.
Come on. Snap it up, faster.
Mr Fauncewater is a burglar by trade, but in this case,
his crime was not burglary.
I'm sorry, the answer's no. One down, nine to go. Miss Birdwell?
If your crime wasn't robbery, did you,
oh, dear, what I mean is,
do something of a violent nature, that is...
Come, Miss Birdwell, we're running short of time.
So sorry. Did you do someone in?
No, Miss Birdwell, I'm sorry.
The answer is no.
Two down, eight to go.
- Mr Simpkins?
- Psst!
Hey, kid, let's go.
Could it be a violation of a city ordinance?
Uh, no. The answer is...
Hey, get out of the way, you little runt!
Three down, seven to go. Inspector?
Very confusing, I must say.
Surely, this crime could...
I'm terribly sorry.
We've run out of time.
Ain't that always the way!
Would it be possible for Mr Fauncewater
to come back next week?
Then we could finish our little game.
Good night, audience. See you next week at this same time on What's My Crime?
Ah. Oh, well.
Come on, Horace.
Let's get on with it.
I'll pop 'em on the head, you do the skinnin'.
No, you don't, Jasper!
I'll pop 'em off and you do the skinnin'.
Horace, look!
They're gone. They flew the coop, right out through this hole.
Here, grab a torch.
We'll run 'em down before you can say "Bob's your uncle."
There they go, Horace, up the stairs.
Here, puppies.
Here, puppies! Come on now.
Don't go hiding from ol' Uncle Jasper.
Oh, I ain't gonna hurt ya.
I thought we was gonna pop 'em off.
Shh! Shut up.
Take a squint in there. I'll check these other two rooms.
Here, puppies.
Puppies, come on out. Come out wherever you are.
Horace! Ooh!
It's that mangy tabby cat!
He's the ringleader!
Head 'em off, Horace! Head 'em...
You bungling blockhead!
Back here! Back here!
Shh! Here they come.
Double-crossin' little twerps, pulling a snitch on us!
After we took care of 'em.
There's gratitude for you.
It ain't fair, Jasper.
Horace, there they go!
Sergeant? I say, Sergeant.
No time to explain. Busy, sir.
Shut that door, Horace!
We'll close in on 'em. Enough of this Ring Around the Rosy.
Oh, Pongo, I'm afraid we're lost.
It can't be far.
By Jove! It can't be the Pongos.
It's the Colonel. This way.
Colonel? Are you the Colonel?
Oh, Pingo! Pongo?
Our puppies, are they all right?
No time to explain.
There's trouble.
A big hullabaloo. Come along!
Follow me!
Now we've got 'em, Horace.
They've run out of room.
What have we got here?
A couple of spotted hyenas?
Come on, Horace. Give 'em what for.
I'm right behind ya, lad.
Oh!
You clumsy clod!
Hey! I'll knock the spots off you. Let go!
Let go!
Well, by George!
You mangy mongrel!
I'll knock your blinkin' block off.
Blast 'em, Tibs. Give 'em what for.
No, Colonel. Retreat, retreat!
Yes. Yes, of course. Retreat!
Retreat, on the double!
Help, Jasper! Get me out of here!
Horace, they're fighting dirty!
Oh!
Jasper!
Horace!
Come on, Perdy. Let's go.
I'll skin every one of them spotted hyenas if it's the last thing I do.
Dad! Mother!
- I missed you, Mommy.
- Here we are, Mommy.
Oh, my darlings, my darlings!
How'd you find us, Dad?
Lucky, Patch, Pepper!
Hi, Freckles.
Oh, Daddy.
And Rolly, you rascal!
Did you bring me anything to eat?
Everybody here? All 15?
Twice that many, Dad.
Now there's 99 of us!
What? Ninety-nine?
Where did they all come from?
What would she want with so many?
She's gonna make coats out of us.
- She couldn't!
- That's right, dog-skin coats.
Oh, dog-skin coats! Come now, Tibs!
But it's true, sir.
Horace and Jasper were gonna pop us off and skin us!
She's a devil, a witch!
What'll we do?
We have to get back to London somehow.
What about the others?
What'll they do?
Perdy, we'll take them home with us, all of them.
Our pets would never turn them out.
Colonel, sir, lights on the road.
It's a truck headin' this way.
It's the Baduns, Horace and Jasper.
They're following our tracks.
We've got 'em outnumbered, Tibs.
When I give the signal, we'll attack.
Colonel, sir, I'm afraid that would be disastrous.
Oh, you think so?
He's right. We'd better run for it.
Out the back way, across the pasture.
Thank you, Sergeant,
Colonel, Captain.
- Bless you all.
- How can we ever repay you?
Nothing at all. All in the line of duty.
That's right, sir, routine.
Better be off. Here they come.
Come on, kids, hurry.
- Good luck, Pongos.
- And never fear.
We'll hold them off
'til the bitter end.
Now, what's this?
Out of my way, you barkin' haystack.
Or I'll knock your blinkin' block off!
They ain't in here, Jasper.
They're hiding in the hay.
Give me a match.
We'll burn 'em out.
Ready, Captain. Aim.
Fire one.
Fire two.
Hey, there they go, the little sneaks.
Come on, back to the truck.
We'll head 'em off in half a mile.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
- I've been thinkin'.
- Now, Horace.
What if they went down the froze-up creek, so's not to leave their tracks?
Horace, you idiot!
Dogs ain't that smart.
All clear, Perdy.
- All clear.
- We gave 'em the slip! Didn't we, Dad?
They didn't even see us, Patch!
Shh, children. Children, shh.
My feet are slippery.
I wish we could walk on the snow.
No, son, we can't leave tracks.
Well, any sign of them?
Not so much as one bloomin' footprint.
And we've been up and down every road in the county.
We're froze stiff. We're givin' up.
Oh, no, you don't!
We'll find the little mongrels if it takes till next Christmas.
Now get going! Watch your driving, you imbeciles! Do you wanna get nabbed by the police?
Ninety-three,
Oh, Lucky!
Come on, Lucky, boy.
We can't give up now.
I'm tired and I'm hungry and my tail's froze, and my nose is froze and my ears are froze.
And my toes are froze.
Pongo!
Pongo! Pongo!
We'd just about lost hope.
We have shelter for you, at the dairy barn across the road.
Oh, thank goodness.
Perdy! Perdy!
This way, Perdy.
- The dairy barn across the road.
- Come on, kids.
It's not far. Come on, this way. Follow the collie.
Just look, Queenie.
- Have you ever seen so many puppies?
- Aren't they adorable!
- Perfectly darling.
- The poor little dears.
They're completely worn out and half frozen!
They all here, Pongo?
Yes, dear. All 99 accounted for.
The famous Pongos. We were so worried about you.
Been trying to reach you.
Afraid you'd been captured.
How did you make it all this way?
- And in such dreadful weather.
- With all those little ones.
I'm hungry, Mother. I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry, too.
- Mother, we're hungry.
- We're all hungry.
- I'm sorry, children.
Do they like warm milk? It's fresh.
- Where is it?
- Where is the milk?
Come and get it, kids.
It's on the house.
This way, children.
Around this way.
Don't crowd. You'll have to take turns.
Rolly, wait your turn, dear.
Don't worry, kids.
There's plenty for all.
Ooh! The little darlings.
Pongo, a few scraps I saved
- for you and the missus.
- Oh, thank you.
It's not much, but it might hold you as far as Dinsford.
Huh? Dinsford?
There's a Labrador there.
His pet is a grocer.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Quite all right.
Get some rest and don't worry.
I'll be standing watch.
I don't know what we'd have done if...
- We're very honoured to be of service.
- We're only sorry we can't do more.
Anyone who would think of hurting these dear little puppies...
- Shh! Duchess!
- They're so dear.
I wish they could stay with us for always.
Princess, shh! Quiet, everyone.
Let them sleep, the poor things.
They're so exhausted and they still have such a long way to go.
Hurry, kids. Hurry!
Well now, what have we here?
Well, so they thought they could outwit Cruella.
Jasper! Horace!
Here's their tracks heading straight for the village.
Blimey! Oh, it's them, all right.
Work your way south on the side roads. I'll take the main road.
See you in Dinsford!
Pongo, I've got a ride home for you.
A ride home? Perdy, did you hear that?
For all of us?
You mean we don't have to walk any more?
If we can manage it.
Come on. We'd better hurry.
We've got a ride home!
Come on, children.
See the van down the street?
It's going to London as soon as the engine's repaired.
And there's room for all of you.
Pongo, there's Cruella.
Yes, and Jasper and Horace.
Pongo, how will we get to the van?
I don't know, Perdy.
But somehow we've got to.
Mother, Dad,
- Patch pushed me in the fireplace.
- Lucky pushed me first.
- Did not. Did not.
- Did, too. Did, too.
Did not!
- Please, children, don't quarrel.
- Say...
Perdy, I've got an idea.
Pongo, what on earth...
Look, I'm a Labrador!
We'll all roll in soot.
We'll be Labradors.
Say, that is an idea!
Come on, kids! Roll in the soot.
You mean, you want us to get dirty?
Did you hear that, Freckles?
Dad wants us to get dirty.
- Mother, should we?
- Do as your father says.
- This'll be fun.
- I always wanted to get good and dirty.
That's the stuff. The blacker the better.
- I'm ready.
- Me, too.
How's this, Dad?
Wait. That's enough. Not too many at a time.
Uh-oh. Rolly, hold on.
You're only half done.
Now, stay right with me.
We're gonna fool the ol' mad lady.
Pongo.
I'm so afraid.
Look, Jasper.
Do you suppose they disguised themselves?
Say now, Horace. That's just what they did.
Dogs is always painting theirselves black!
You idiot!
Well, so far so good.
Come on, Perdy. Better get on your make-up.
I'll go ahead with the next bunch.
Jasper! Horace!
- Well?
- Aw, now be reasonable, miss.
We're froze clean to our bones.
We've been out all night and all day, with nothin' to eat.
They're somewhere in this village, and we're going to find them.
Now get swing!
Do you think they've seen us?
No, but we're running out of time.
Try 'er again, mate.
Hurry, Perdy. The van's about to leave.
Better hurry.
I'll get the rest.
That ought to do her. She'll get you back to London.
Better get aboard, miss.
Hey, Jasper.
Come on, Horace.
Hurry, kids!
Come on, kids. Run on ahead.
- She's watching us, Dad.
- Keep going.
It can't be!
It's impossible!
Run for it!
Jasper! Horace!
Jasper!
There they go! In the van.
After them! After them!
Pongo! There she is, Cruella.
Hey, lady, what in thunder are you tryin' to do?
Crazy woman driver!
Pongo, look!
Jasper!
Ain't nothin' to it.
I'll give him a nudge and shove him in the dirt.
Perdy, watch out!
- Jasper!
- Horace!
You idiots!
You fools!
You imbeciles!
Ah, shut up!
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De
Roger, after all, that's your first big hit.
It's made more money than we ever dreamed of.
Yes, I know.
I still can't believe that Pongo and Perdy would run away.
Here's a bit of Christmas cheer for you, if there's anything to be cheerful about.
Oh, the dear little things.
Sometimes at night I can hear them barking.
But it always turns out I'm dreaming.
Roger, what on earth...
They're Labradors!
No, no. They're covered with soot.
Look, here's Lucky!
Pongo, boy, is that you?
Oh, Pongo, Pongo!
Ho-ho, it's Pongo!
And Perdy, my darling.
And Patch, and Rolly, and Penny, and Freckles.
They're all here, the little dears.
- It's a miracle!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!
And look, there's a whole lot more!
Look, Anita, puppies everywhere.
There must be 100!
One, two, three and four, is seven.
Two, four, six, and three is nine, plus two is 11.
- Thirty-six over here.
- Thirty-six and 11, that's 47!
- Eighteen, Roger.
- That's 65!
Ten, 11, 12, 13!
Wait a minute, six more.
Let's see, that's 84.
And 15 plus two, 101!
A hundred and one? Where did they come from?
Oh, Pongo, you old rascal!
- What'll we do with them?
- We'll keep 'em.
- In this little house?
- We'll buy a big place in the country.
We'll have a plantation, a Dalmatian plantation.
Roger, that's truly an inspiration.
It'll be a sensation!
We'll have a Dalmatian plantation.
A Dalmatian plantation, I say.
We'll have a dalmatian plantation
Where our population can roam
- I'm hungry, mother.
- In this new location
Our whole aggregation
Will love our plantation home
Dalmatian plantation home

{11212}{11276}WENDY: It was late|one misty evening
{11277}{11317}and Hook was sure once again...
{11318}{11362}that he'd found|Peter's hide out.
{11363}{11426}Hook and his blood thirsty crew|went ashore
{11427}{11494}leaving the Jolly Roger|unguarded.
{11495}{11608}That's when Peter Pan arrived
{11609}{11690}He and the Boys|slipped aboard
{11691}{11786}and there they found it--|Hook's remarkable treasure
{11787}{11820}DANNY: Wow
{11821}{11858}WENDY: Peter told|the Lost Boys they'd hide it
{11859}{11937}and Hook would have to hunt|them down to get it back.
{11937}{12020}It was all a great game|for Peter, and then
{12021}{12096}from out of the mist,|he was there--
{12097}{12137}the evil Captain Hook
{12138}{12212}A fierce and ferocious|sword fight was fast underway.

{95463}{95510}How the magic's in music

{95715}{95799}Believe in the magic|of a young girl's soul
{95800}{95883}Believe in the magic|of rock and roll
{95883}{95972}Believe in the magic|that can set you free

{97531}{97602}I am not a child now
{97603}{97681}I can take care of myself
{97682}{97753}I mustn't|let them down, now
{97754}{97835}Mustn't let them|see me cry
{97874}{97936}I'm fine
{97937}{97986}I'm fine
{98130}{98205}I'm too tired to listen
{98206}{98279}I'm too old to believe
{98280}{98355}All these childish stories
{98356}{98468}There is no such thing|as faith
{98469}{98533}And trust
{98534}{98591}And pixie dust
{98686}{98760}I try
{98761}{98837}But It's so hard|to believe
{98838}{98910}I try
{98911}{98988}But I can't see|what you see
{98989}{99064}I try
{99065}{99148}I try
{99150}{99201}I try
{99334}{99413}My whole world is changing
{99414}{99483}I don't know where to turn
{99484}{99557}I can't leave you waiting
{99558}{99721}But I can't stay|and watch the city burn
{99722}{99804}Mmm, watch it burn
{99889}{99967}'Cause I try
{99968}{100043}But It's so hard|to believe
{100044}{100117}I try
{100118}{100192}But I can't see|what you see
{100193}{100261}I try
{100262}{100348}I try
{100349}{100437}I try and try|to understand
{100438}{100507}The distance in between
{100508}{100588}The love I feel|and the things I fear
{100589}{100729}And every single dream
{100806}{100881}I can finally see It
{100882}{100957}Now I have to believe
{100958}{101031}All those precious stories
{101032}{101131}All the world|is made of faith
{101132}{101201}And trust

{102205}{102254}To fly
[418][443]{Y:i}I found myself in a dark forest,
[444][473]{Y:i}for the clear path was lost.
[474][505]{Y:i}I cannot well recount|how I entered the wood,
[506][544]{Y:i}so long had it been|since I abandoned the true way.
[558][593]{Y:i}How shall I say what a dreary|and horrid wood it was?
[594][636]{Y:i}So bitter to endurw that death itself|would be but little worse.
[674][693]{Y:i}Several times upon my journey home,
[694][725]{Y:i}I had sensed an unseen rider|trailing my steed.
[727][760]{Y:i}Yet, when I approached, the rider vanished,
[772][791]{Y:i}leaving no trace.
[803][830]{Y:i}I feared this figure as an evil omen.
[831][871]{Y:i}All my life I've known such signs|and portents.
[921][957]{Y:i}And lo, at the rise of the hill,|I saw a spotted leopard,
[958][979]{Y:i}all teeth and fury.
[990][1015]{Y:i}At the sight of these beasts,|my heart sank.
[1016][1051]{Y:i}I sensed danger not for myself,|but for my beloved Beatrice.
[1078][1095]{Y:i}Away, demon!
[1200][1234]{Y:i}I drove my steed on,|racing for my father's villa.
[1235][1274]{Y:i}And Beatrice... nothing in this world|meant more to me than she.
[1283][1298]You were right, Dante.
[1299][1334]Truly this is a divine place.|Paradise on Earth.
[1336][1366]Beatrice, will you take my hand in marriage,
[1368][1389]under God and all that is holy?
[1394][1444]Dante, I will not marry you|only to see you dead in this crusade.
[1445][1474]Jerusalem must be made Christian|once more.
[1475][1496]God is with us. We cannot fail.
[1519][1544]Through three years of war and horror,
[1545][1574]my love for Beatrice|had only grown stronger.
[1605][1627]As I came upon the family estate,
[1628][1659]I found all unnaturally dark and still.
[1705][1737]Fearing the dreaded omens, I entered.
[1854][1881]The servants. All butchered.
[1982][2012]Father. Oh, Father.
[2021][2056]Beatrice! Lord, let her be alive!
[2090][2110]In the name of God.
[2133][2149]Where is...
[2150][2169]Oh, no. No.
[2170][2190]Beloved, are you all right?
[2233][2251]Beatrice.
[2259][2288]Is it you or a dream?
[2301][2314]Who did this to you?
[2316][2330]I know not.
[2331][2363]A stranger. A foreigner.
[2386][2433]Do you remember that night|before you left?
[2434][2446]What we said?
[2447][2458]I remember.
[2459][2496]Did you betray me?
[2522][2540]Never.
[2631][2654]I never should have left your side.
[2656][2674]Forgive me.
[2715][2736]What?
[2772][2800]Do my eyes deceive me?
[2801][2842]Fear not for me, my love.|I told him you would be true to me.
[2852][2870]I knew you would.
[2917][2945]No! Wait! Come back to me!
[2976][2995]What is this?
[3031][3046]God in Heaven!
[3048][3067]What? Dante?
[3068][3093]She is mine.
[3094][3111]No!
[3118][3156]I have come to take|what was promised me...
[3158][3197]a soul meant for Heaven.
[3203][3218]It can't be true.
[3219][3240]Dante would never betray me.
[3252][3265]Beatrice!
[3267][3287]Release her, devil!
[3393][3413]Dante, help me!
[3424][3440]No!
[3538][3577]This will not stop me!|Nothing will stop me!
[3632][3644]No!
[3745][3762]What?
[3763][3780]No!
[3781][3807]God, give me strength!
[3834][3876]Come with me, mortal,|if you have the courage.
[3877][3909]Dante, don't let him take me!
[3917][3934]Beatrice!
[3976][4018]You will not keep me from my beloved!
[4088][4129]Dante, you lied to me! I trusted you!
[4130][4170]You've got to save me! Dante!
[4200][4235]I'm coming for you!|I won't let him hurt you!
[4236][4277]Beatrice! No!
[4356][4387]- Martyr.|- You lost her.
[4388][4416]- Martyr.|- You lied to her.
[4417][4427]You lost her.
[4428][4450]Never will you know her flesh again.
[4452][4500]Never will you know her love.
[4502][4511]Her sin.
[4512][4536]- Martyr. Martyr.|- You lost her!
[4537][4561]- Her desire.|- You lied to her.
[4562][4586]- Your sins.|- Never will you know her flesh again.
[4608][4623]Your sins.
[4624][4648]Never will you know her flesh.
[4649][4669]You are bound.
[4670][4706]- Martyr.|- You lied to her.
[4707][4731]- Martyr.|- Martyr.
[4748][4783]Why, God?|Why are you doing this?
[4796][4830]It is not the Lord that brought you|to this fate, Dante.
[4854][4880]What are you? Shade or living man?
[4882][4912]Not man, though once I was.
[4913][4952]I lived under Augustus in the time|of the false and lying gods.
[4953][4984]Are you not Virgil, glory of the poets?
[4985][5013]He who wrote the Aeneid,|the treasure of Rome?
[5014][5038]Why do you seek such woe, Dante?
[5039][5067]I seek only my beloved Beatrice|and nothing more.
[5068][5103]But I cannot open these accursed gates!
[5117][5147]Have you lost all faith in God, O man?
[5148][5171]Has the way been so obscured?
[5194][5226]Heavenly Father,|if only one soul should be saved,
[5227][5252]please let it be Beatrice.
[5281][5308]Help! Help!
[5373][5423]Dante, if you broke your promise to me,|I'll be forever damned.
[5425][5468]Are you prepared to be judged in this place?
[5469][5501]Do you think you are without sin?
[5503][5528]Please, don't let him take me!
[5529][5568]Beatrice. Beatrice!
[5911][5946]What did Beatrice do|to deserve such a monstrous fate?
[5948][5986]She made a wager with Lucifer|to see your safe return.
[5987][5998]She lost.
[6000][6017]Wager. What wager?
[6018][6046]Lucifer bet that you would betray her love.
[6048][6066]I never betrayed her.
[6067][6095]You only deceive yourself, mortal.
[6096][6140]By all that is holy, I vow to forsake|all pleasures of the flesh
[6141][6165]until I return from this noble crusade.
[6166][6211]I gave myself to you because I know|you will be faithful to our love.
[6225][6257]And when I return, we shall be married.
[6258][6291]And live to grow old and see|our grandchildren have children.
[6331][6361]I love you more than Heaven itself.
[6394][6413]- Take this.|- But, Beatrice,
[6414][6443]this has been in your family|for generations.
[6449][6463]It is a true relic
[6464][6495]said to contain a thorn|from the crown of Christ.
[6496][6514]Bring it back to me.
[6560][6585]Great Virgil, lead me into the Inferno.
[6587][6606]I beg of you, please!
[6607][6643]I must save Beatrice|even if it means my death.
[6644][6694]I will guide you, but you must put aside|all division of spirit
[6695][6723]and gather your soul against all fear.
[6738][6755]I fear nothing.
[6756][6772]Then proceed.
[6828][6871]Charon will carry us|to the first circle of Hell, Limbo.
[6873][6897]Nine circles comprise the Inferno,
[6899][6922]with Lucifer residing in the lowest.
[6928][6944]Horrifying, yes.
[6946][6962]There are more damned in Hell...
[6964][6986]than liberated in Paradise.
[6997][7022]I can see their sins in life.
[7050][7087]Charon's boat has grown wide|and mighty over the millennia.
[7088][7123]He has had to compensate|for the ever-increasing damned.
[7125][7160]Through me the way to the city of woe.
[7161][7202]Through me the way to everlasting pain.
[7203][7217]I don't like the look of this.
[7218][7249]Now shall I ferry you into the fire,
[7250][7286]the cold and the everlasting darkness.
[7287][7326]Abandon hope,|all ye who enter here.
[7327][7346]How could God allow this?
[7347][7382]God allowed free will, even for his angels.
[7384][7417]It was Lucifer that devised such torment.
[7418][7439]Mercenaries of Florentina,
[7440][7466]in payment for reclaiming|the Holy Land,
[7467][7522]your Immaculate Father hereby|absolves you of all your sins.
[7523][7543]Go with grace.
[7575][7588]Praise God.
[7601][7630]Do you think a priest|has such divine power?
[7631][7656]Can he truly absolve us of sins so easily?
[7657][7671]Of course, Francesco.
[7672][7713]Why would you doubt the Church?|That is the path to Hell, my friend.
[7714][7731]How soon until you leave?
[7732][7758]Tomorrow, before dawn.
[7759][7790]Dante, promise to watch over my brother.
[7791][7815]Beatrice, I'm no child.
[7823][7845]No harm will come to him, my love.
[7846][7867]I'll protect him as if he were my own.
[7886][7910]You who are living,
[7911][7945]be gone from those who are dead.
[7946][7965]I will not part, Charon!
[7966][7990]I must cross!
[7992][8018]I give you my soul to find Beatrice!
[8019][8060]It belongs to us already, mortal.
[8529][8556]Your will is nothing, mortal.
[8557][8593]You will never traverse the circles of Hell.
[8617][8639]Take me to Beatrice, demon!
[8972][8995]Virgil, where did you disappear to?
[8999][9019]I am pure spirit, Dante.
[9020][9057]I cannot help you fight your enemies.|I am naught but a guide.
[9303][9346]Dante! Can you hear me?
[9356][9384]Can anyone hear me?
[9435][9456]Dante?
[9457][9487]Thank God.|I knew you would find me.
[9489][9503]Dante?
[9505][9535]Beatrice, my love.
[9537][9557]Is... Is that you?
[9610][9634]No! Dante!
[9635][9660]No, stop! Stop, Dante!
[9779][9801]What's happening?
[9803][9834]How many ways can a man die?
[9835][9846]No!
[9847][9871]Come to me, Beatrice.
[9879][9914]- I want to admire you.|- No. Let me go.
[9915][9954]There is not only suffering in Hell, my love.
[9963][9995]There are untold pleasures here,
[9996][10051]pleasures your human senses|could not fathom.
[10052][10066]Never!
[10206][10263]There is nothing you can do|to hurt me, child.
[10268][10322]What you perceive of me is a literal shadow|of my former self,
[10324][10349]but you...
[10362][10419]you can die a thousand deaths by my will.
[10496][10512]What?
[10543][10571]Think of the tortures I can create
[10572][10624]for such a pure, delicate, angelic soul.
[10694][10721]Tell me more about your life on Earth,|great poet.
[10722][10749]I know your deeds,|but not the man you were.
[10750][10777]Publius Vergilius Maro was my name.
[10778][10798]I was the son of a commoner,
[10799][10833]and though I died a dozen years|before the birth of Christ,
[10834][10857]I foretold his coming in my works.
[10858][10880]What is this place, Virgil?
[10881][10914]The first circle of the Inferno, Limbo.
[10920][10942]Here suffer those that did not sin,
[10943][10971]yet did not have the required faith.
[10972][11019]This is the realm where virtuous pagans|and unbaptized babies reside.
[11094][11122]A child? Here?
[11123][11143]How can this be?
[11157][11175]Dearest Dante.
[11177][11225]This is the fourth letter I have written|and the fourth I have destroyed.
[11227][11256]I am five months with child.
[11265][11296]I fear telling your father|as we have yet to be married.
[11305][11343]I do not know how much longer|I can conceal my state.
[11344][11377]All I ask is that you return to me soon.
[11378][11412]Leave this terrible crusade,
[11413][11449]and we... we can be married.
[11536][11555]My lady, what is it?
[11556][11579]The baby.
[11719][11748]This is my son.
[11801][11834]Oh, Beatrice, I didn't know.
[11845][11881]Come. Quickly, Dante.|This is not a place to contemplate.
[11918][11942]What madness is this?
[12116][12142]Lord, too many.
[12220][12236]Virgil. Virgil!
[12237][12256]In here, Dante. Hurry.
[12447][12475]What is that sound?|More demons?
[12477][12495]No.
[12575][12598]They are familiar to me.
[12599][12632]The great rulers and philosophers|of the golden age.
[12633][12659]Is that not Hector and Electra?
[12660][12679]Caesar and King Latinus?
[12680][12704]And do not forget Plato,|Socrates and Aristotle.
[12706][12722]I have never agreed to such terms.
[12724][12771]I say that God exists in the realm of ideas,|accessible to human thought.
[12772][12834]Plato, there is only one philosophy|in the Inferno - Lucifer's.
[12835][12875]Do not look for liberation here, old friend.
[12887][12913]- Do you know this shade?|- He was Saladin,
[12914][12931]a noble Kurdish sultan.
[12933][12975]I fought his forces in the Crusades|under Richard the Lionheart.
[13032][13065]Filthy heretic, Jerusalem is ours.
[13084][13121]We will wash these holy lands|in your heathen blood.
[13128][13142]Father...
[13154][13184]Mercy, noble knight. She's only a child.
[13185][13227]Dante! Dante, the forces|of Saladin arw routed!
[13229][13247]Dante?
[13615][13637]My God, what is it?
[13638][13657]He is King Minos.
[13658][13679]Once a king of Crete
[13680][13714]before Daedalus|boiled him in his own bath.
[13715][13751]Now, Minos foreverjudges the damned,
[13753][13780]sending them to their circle below.
[13790][13807]- Through him...|- Traitor.
[13808][13828]...all must pass.
[13829][13846]Heretic.
[13857][13875]Glutton.
[13883][13902]Hoarder.
[13903][13921]Suicide!
[13940][13973]Who comes into my house of pain?
[13974][14012]He who seeks Beatrice.|Let me pass, that I may find her.
[14039][14090]Turn back.|There is no place for you here.
[14091][14122]Not yet, O mortal.
[14123][14160]With your permission or not,|I pass, monster.
[14162][14202]You dare so speak|to the judge of the damned?
[14258][14274]I dare.
[14555][14596]I will judge you to the lowest circle of Hell.
[14613][14648]Lucifer shall devour you for eternity!
[14650][14688]Silence, Minos. It is his fate to proceed.
[15027][15048]Here you must descend.
[15096][15118]The damned are trying to flee.
[15119][15142]Lucifer will not be pleased.
[15152][15186]Let him come.|If these demons can die in the Inferno,
[15187][15208]then so can he.
[15426][15442]What is this place?
[15443][15477]This is the second circle,|the circle of Lust.
[15478][15510]To this torment are condemned|the carnal damned.
[15511][15531]They are the great lustful of the world.
[15532][15590]See there Semiramis and Ninus,|Anthony and Cleopatra,
[15591][15615]Helen of Troy and Paris.
[15616][15642]The storms of lust forever rage
[15643][15666]while passion inflames the heart.
[15692][15727]Listen, on the wind.
[15729][15756]- Dante, help me.|- Beatrice!
[15757][15775]Please, Dante.
[15777][15793]Dante.
[15795][15820]- Beatrice!|- Dante, hold.
[15821][15840]Beatrice!
[15856][15890]A new visitor arrives, sisters.
[15910][15944]Come, embrace us, Dante.
[15946][15988]We know what you want.|We can see it in your eyes.
[15990][16016]Unbearable lust.
[16027][16059]No, let me pass.|Stand aside, harlot.
[16064][16104]If you won't have us, we shall have you!
[16416][16438]Dante, how could you let this happen?
[16439][16455]How could you betray me?
[16456][16476]No, Beatrice. I swear.
[16478][16502]What do you swear, Dante?
[16503][16530]Do you want me to show her the truth?
[16531][16570]Serpent. It's all lies.|I never betrayed her.
[16572][16597]I'll kill you!
[16608][16665]You can hide from|neither memory nor sin, Dante.
[16705][16750]What? King Richard wants us|to stand guard over 3,000 prisoners?
[16751][16767]That is his command?
[16773][16809]He will negotiate their exchange|for the rwturn of the true Cross.
[16810][16842]Negotiate with heretics?
[16843][16880]Never! They deserve only damnation.
[16910][16931]Get your hands off her.
[16941][16978]Infidel scum. We'll show you not to defy us.
[17063][17101]Good and noble knights, have mercy.|I beg you!
[17102][17143]This prisoner only tried to save me|from the guards.
[17153][17193]Please, sir, show compassion.|He is no threat.
[17195][17224]He is a heretic.|He gets what he deserves.
[17257][17295]Kind lord, if you would show him mercy
[17296][17334]perhaps I could give you comfort in return.
[17335][17366]What comfort could you give|a soldier of God?
[17399][17431]The nights here are lonely and cold,|my lord,
[17432][17462]even for a soldier of God.
[17463][17481]Perhaps I could warm thee.
[17482][17509]Dante, do not commit this wicked sin.
[17510][17538]How is it a sin if I am already absolved?
[17540][17560]Guards, hold.
[17621][17651]Thank you, Lord. You are kind.
[17653][17676]I could see it in your eyes.
[17677][17701]And your promise of comfort?
[17790][17815]How could you do that to me...
[17816][17838]to us?
[17839][17865]I was weak. The war changed me.
[17867][17902]You know who I am inside.|We've known each other since childhood.
[17903][17929]Does she know you, Dante,
[17930][17968]or did the Crusades show her your true self?
[17973][18001]Beatrice! Forgive me!
[18016][18041]Please forgive me.
[18064][18111]No, it's not true.|He wouldn't do this to me.
[18112][18132]Dante!
[18134][18151]What did I say?
[18152][18187]Even the purest of souls|can be corrupted.
[18189][18223]Dante is not the man you once knew.
[18224][18265]You did this to him.|You corrupted his heart.
[18280][18309]I've had no need to influence humanity
[18310][18338]for many millennia, my dear.
[18340][18377]I simply introduced sin.
[18378][18421]Man is the one who has spread it|like a disease,
[18423][18461]cultivating it, empowering it.
[18583][18617]It is not our fault, none of it.
[18619][18637]Man is good.
[18638][18667]No, you don't understand.
[18668][18703]The Earth is another form of Hell,
[18705][18735]and men are its demons.
[18800][18829]I failed her, Virgil. I betrayed her.
[18830][18865]I could blame the Crusades,|but I know it was my own weakness,
[18866][18881]my own sin.
[18882][18921]Have you considered she is not|the only soul you are here to save?
[18942][18969]I seek only my beloved Beatrice,
[18970][18988]and nothing more.
[19013][19027]It is Cerberus,
[19029][19069]guardian of the third circle, Gluttony.
[19206][19246]That is the foulest fate|one could ever imagine.
[19248][19286]And it is your fate as well,|for the true circle of Gluttony
[19288][19316]lies inside of Cerberus's body.
[19318][19365]Inside? Good Lord, isn't there|perhaps a way around it?
[19366][19401]No, not if you wish to reach fair Beatrice.
[19402][19438]So be it! For her I will conquer even this.
[19439][19460]Face me, wretched creature!
[19500][19521]Release me, demon!
[19704][19746]Hell can get no more horrible|than this place.
[19747][19774]I find this circle most unpleasant.
[19775][19799]You're a shade.|You should try wearing skin.
[19801][19822]Such a fate. Look at them all.
[19823][19861]How could such harmless sin|provoke such everlasting torment?
[19862][19899]The gluttons -|what they could not satisfy in life,
[19900][19930]in death they shall be denied for eternity.
[19932][19963]Dante. Do you remember me, Dante?
[19964][20003]I too am from Florence.|You were born before I died.
[20004][20022]I do not know you, spirit.
[20023][20055]You know me. I am Ciacco.
[20056][20074]Gluttony was my offense,
[20075][20110]and here I remain|mere skin and bones.
[20111][20146]Can you help me,|free me from this agony?
[20147][20161]Please, please.
[20162][20207]Your suffering weighs heavy|on my heart, spirit. Be free.
[20356][20367]Virgil, what's happening?
[20368][20399]How dare you free the damned?
[20400][20450]They deserve torment for wasting|their fleeting precious lives.
[20451][20479]And Beatrice? Does she deserve torment?
[20480][20501]She is the exception.
[20502][20547]A pure soul to remind me|of my place in Heaven,
[20548][20587]to remind me of the light of my father.
[20596][20621]But let me ask you, Dante,
[20622][20652]what of your father?
[20663][20689]Beatrice, you must eat.
[20690][20709]I have no appetite.
[20711][20732]I know you miss my son,
[20734][20767]but you must keep up|your constitution, child.
[20768][20790]You're nothing but bone.
[20791][20822]It's unappealing for a lady.
[20840][20870]Beatrice, what have you done to yourself?
[20919][20945]It's just another memory, Dante.
[20956][20979]Your father's memory.
[20981][21021]- My father?|- He is here with us, Dante.
[21022][21043]Would you like to visit him?
[21146][21175]Do these tortures never end?
[21196][21214]Virgil, Beatrice is not here.
[21215][21236]We must escape this beast!
[21293][21319]What is this?
[21328][21367]Cerberus's black heart.|Destroy it, quickly.
[21663][21681]Beatrice!
[21986][22018]More gold than I've ever laid eyes upon.
[22019][22048]What could one man do|with so much treasure?
[22059][22097]This is the fourth circle - Grwed.
[22270][22308]All the Earth's treasure|that is beneath the moon or ever was
[22309][22337]cannot give relief to these weary souls.
[22397][22432]What a mockery is made|of the brief battle for possessions
[22433][22451]that makes so short a life.
[22452][22481]These damned remind me of my father.
[22604][22644]What? Where are my last three coins?
[22645][22664]Dante?
[22676][22691]Dante!
[22709][22724]Bella!
[22741][22757]Yes, husband.
[22759][22787]I'm short three crowns.
[22788][22812]Are you stealing from me, woman?
[22814][22847]No, Alighiero,|I would never do such a thing.
[22865][22879]Liar!
[22922][22942]I knew I'd have to watch you.
[22943][22965]Now, tell me where|you've hidden it, woman,
[22967][22995]before I throttle you dead.
[23025][23048]Don't hit her! Mother!
[23190][23216]Can you believe that in my youth|I wanted to be a poet?
[23217][23241]But all I ever knew was violence.
[23242][23260]And what became of your mother?
[23262][23283]She died of a fever a year later.
[23284][23305]It was sudden and terrible.
[23322][23363]There is no room to pity the dead here, son.
[23365][23411]Lucifer did not lie, but then again|how could you not be here, Father?
[23418][23446]You think you're a greater man than me?
[23447][23476]That you're above reproach for your sins?
[23477][23513]I took up the Crusade.|The priest absolved us.
[23519][23545]And you actually believed him?
[23546][23573]No man can absolve you of your sins,
[23574][23612]but some men can be rewarded in Hell.
[23717][23747]Lucifer offered me a thousand years|free of torture
[23748][23792]and endless gold|if I would slay my own son.
[23797][23817]And where will you spend this gold, Father?
[23818][23848]Let me pass. I only seek Beatrice.
[23899][23914]So be it.
[24071][24094]I always despised you.
[24113][24137]But you became me, son.
[24139][24171]You belong here. You always have.
[24216][24249]So I can be damned in Hell with you?|Never!
[24336][24376]It's time to claim my prize, boy.
[24377][24395]Then claim it.
[24545][24570]You want gold, Father?
[24571][24586]It's yours.
[24648][24676]I cannot go on.
[24677][24693]You must, Dante.
[24694][24727]Steel yourself.|The journey is not half over.
[24728][24775]How do I know you're not|another enemy sent by Lucifer?
[24776][24800]You could be luring me|to my doom all along.
[24801][24823]Another trick, another deception.
[24824][24843]Search inside yourself.
[24844][24872]You know I was sent here from on high.
[24874][24892]Forgive me, Virgil.
[24893][24922]This place has affected my mind.|Let us move on.
[24993][25033]Please, Lord.|Forgive me of my transgressions.
[25034][25060]Save me from this horrible torment.
[25061][25093]Please, I beg of you.
[25138][25158]My God.
[25159][25196]I have heard your prayers,|beloved Beatrice,
[25198][25219]and I have come for you.
[25234][25268]There is no escape, little soul.
[25269][25299]Your prayers are worthless here.
[25408][25427]Rejoice, child,
[25428][25475]for you are about to be granted|a rare privilege in the Inferno.
[25485][25516]I am making you my bride.
[25525][25558]You will become the Queen of Hell.
[25570][25592]Are you not pleased?
[25712][25753]I cannot stand this wretched place.
[25754][25789]For we are in the fifth circle, Anger.
[25790][25817]The very air reeks of fury.
[25819][25842]Watch your ankles.
[25882][25912]More food! We're starving!
[25948][25964]We need more food.
[25989][26011]We're doing the best we can.
[26013][26048]There isn't enough food to go around.|Quiet! Quiet down!
[26049][26071]There is nothing we can do.
[26072][26092]The granaries are ablaze.
[26093][26114]We barely have enough rations|for our own men.
[26115][26153]Then I'm leaving this post.|I will not put up with guard duty any longer.
[26154][26176]You can't do that, Dante.
[26177][26207]We came here to kill these heretics,|not coddle them.
[26208][26230]We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
[26231][26269]Saladin took the city last year|and spared Christian lives.
[26270][26280]We should do the same.
[26281][26309]Since when arw herwtics|worth a Christian life?
[26310][26328]Enough. Enough!
[26438][26480]Keep your mind, Dante.|Do not dwell on past deeds here.
[26500][26529]See the souls over whom|anger has prevailed.
[26538][26583]In the black sludge of the River Styx|do they wish they had never been born.
[26584][26619]The fools. It is here we must cross.
[26705][26724]We travel in that?
[26725][26749]Perhaps we would be safer swimming.
[26818][26845]I suppose it doesn't get much sturdier.
[26846][26873]Is this a friend of yours, great poet?
[26874][26902]Phlegias is the guardian of the Styx.
[26904][26929]He was the son of Ares|and a king in his day.
[26931][26966]Hold on.|The ride will be somewhat bumpy.
[26975][27009]The angry souls know no end to their fury.
[27010][27055]Who are you that comes here|before your time?
[27056][27076]If I come, I do not remain.
[27077][27111]But I know you, hell dog, filthy as you are.
[27112][27129]You were Filippo Argenti in life.
[27130][27174]Come down, Dante,|and face your old enemy!
[27176][27211]Let the damned rip you to shreds, wretch.
[27400][27438]Now, my son, the City of Dis draws near,
[27440][27465]housing its solemn citizens within.
[27486][27534]Damned of Dis rejoice,|for your lord, Lucifer,
[27535][27570]is betrothing the pure soul, Beatrice.
[27571][27623]Truly this will be a marriage|of Heaven and Hell.
[27624][27653]Hurry, Phlegias! Run!
[27721][27733]Beatrice!
[27773][27813]Outcasts of Heaven, race despised,
[27814][27857]why do you rail against a will|that cannot be stopped?
[27866][27883]Dante?
[28096][28128]He has taken her into the tombs.|Hurry, Dante.
[28178][28230]Gone. Why does he do this?|Bait us on? Keep us running?
[28232][28267]Perhaps Lucifer wants your soul|as well as Beatrice's.
[28269][28293]He's luring us to the ninth circle.
[28305][28340]- What is this place?|- The tombs of heresy.
[28342][28375]Here in the sixth circle|you will find endless heretics
[28376][28397]burning in eternal fire.
[28410][28465]O Tuscan, who walks through this place|speaking so decorously,
[28466][28498]know that I am Farinata.
[28499][28548]Farinata, another hated man in life.|What do you want, spirit?
[28549][28562]Know this.
[28564][28608]The damned can foresee the future|but can never know the present.
[28609][28663]Your future, Dante,|is filled with death and destruction.
[28664][28703]Beatrice will marry Lucifer and reign in Hell,
[28705][28751]and you will be damned with us forever.
[28845][28864]I never liked him.
[28873][28887]What's happening?
[28888][28904]The harrowing of Hell.
[28905][28930]Christ's death forever quakes this circle.
[28931][28948]We must hurry.
[28972][29008]Let me go. What do you want from me?
[29009][29042]I have taken countless brides|over the millennia -
[29043][29083]Cleopatra, Salome, Helen of Troy.
[29085][29140]But, unlike them,|your spirit is pure, unspoiled.
[29141][29161]I will never succumb to you.
[29162][29178]Kill me again and again,
[29179][29221]slit my throat, tear me to pieces,|but I will never love you.
[29261][29287]Yes, such passion.
[29288][29311]You have a fire inside you.
[29313][29331]After we are properly married,
[29332][29373]you will give me a brood|to carry on my legacy.
[29374][29429]You will be birthing my children for eternity,|sweet soul.
[29445][29471]Virgil, do you hear...
[29547][29582]Who is this new monster?|What does he want?
[29583][29615]The minotaur guards passage|into the seventh circle.
[29616][29631]Be cautious, Dante.
[29643][29660]How dare you threaten us?
[29661][29697]Do you think he is the duke of Athens|who served up your death above?
[29698][29731]Off with you.|Begone, abomination!
[29733][29752]Virgil, I think you've made him angry.
[29753][29773]Now, while he is blind with rage.
[29774][29799]Hold fast. Steady.
[29800][29816]Now move!
[29894][29916]You have many surprises, poet.
[29917][29950]Perhaps you would have made|a great warrior in life.
[29951][29990]It was nothing. He was all horn, no brains.
[30073][30100]This circle is reserved for the violent.
[30101][30124]Those who have done violence|against others
[30126][30153]forever boil in the blood they have shed.
[30169][30188]How shall we cross?
[30189][30210]It's impossible.
[30247][30266]You summoned me, great Virgil.
[30267][30285]Greetings, Nessus.
[30287][30327]We need passage across the bloody|Phlegethon. Can you help us?
[30328][30358]Of course. Climb and hold on tightly.
[30376][30395]The river is treacherous.
[30412][30449]Here is Alexander, Dionysius, Attila,
[30450][30472]and countless others.
[30480][30512]The damned here|are worse off than the Styx.
[30513][30556]These were the kings of bloodshed|and despoilment.
[30727][30757]Be wary of the next passage, friends.
[30758][30778]My thanks, Nessus.
[30780][30806]Good luck to you, mortal soul.
[30833][30868]We must hurry. Beatrice can wait no longer.
[30910][30938]This is no forest.
[30939][30973]Yes, they are those who did violence|to themselves.
[30975][31002]- This is the wood of suicide.|- Dante...
[31004][31028]- No, my friend! Turn back!|- Come to me, Dante.
[31029][31056]Come to me, Dante.
[31058][31081]Come to me.
[31083][31127]Why do you break me?|Have you no pity?
[31128][31141]Mother?
[31142][31158]Yes, son.
[31159][31186]I too am among the damned.
[31187][31210]But how can this be?
[31217][31237]When a soul takes its own life,
[31238][31261]Minos judges it to this circle.
[31263][31293]Here it sprouts, shoots up like a sapling.
[31294][31317]No body, only pain.
[31318][31351]No, Mother, you don't belong here.
[31352][31368]You died of fever.
[31377][31401]Her heart gave out from the fever.
[31402][31427]She was just too fragile.
[31428][31447]Where is she now, Father?
[31448][31502]In Paradise, son,|with all the souls of pure light.
[31507][31531]I despised your father's cruelty,
[31532][31559]but I was too weak to defy him.
[31561][31585]And so, I...
[31586][31601]I took my...
[31617][31664]You learned your father's ways,|but you are not lost.
[31665][31690]You can redeem yourself.
[31692][31735]Beatrice was all I had.|How could I have betrayed her?
[31737][31776]The pain you endure purifies you, son.
[31778][31839]Heed my words. You must look|into your deepest sin to save her.
[31849][31868]And what of you?
[31869][31919]Only the living can redeem themselves.|I cannot.
[31920][31952]This is too cruel a punishment|for you, Mother.
[31954][31997]God must know this is not your fault.|I'm going to free you.
[32080][32116]My soul belongs to God now, son.
[32275][32300]We are still in the seventh circle?
[32301][32328]Yes, the Abominable Sands.
[32329][32368]It is here the damned|did violence against God.
[32404][32436]We came here to kill these heretics.
[32437][32460]We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
[32461][32506]Saladin took the city last year and spared|Christian lives. We should do the same.
[32507][32542]Since when arw herwtics|worth a Christian life?
[32543][32561]Enough. Enough!
[32573][32588]Dante, no!
[32730][32746]Fight with me, Crusaders.
[32747][32768]Spill the blood of these heathens.
[32769][32797]Their souls are already lost.
[32804][32831]Dante, what have you done?
[33083][33106]Crusaders? Herw?
[33107][33124]Why are you being punished?
[33125][33156]Our cause was holy.|We are absolved of sin.
[33185][33238]The bishop lied, did he not, brother?
[33239][33268]Francesco, not you too.
[33269][33295]God never condones violence of any kind.
[33296][33327]There was no holy war.|Don't you understand?
[33328][33348]The priests lied.
[33349][33379]Of all people, how could you be here?
[33385][33408]It was you! You did this to me!
[33410][33428]No, no, no, listen.
[33429][33466]You don't deserve the life given to you,
[33467][33490]you don't deserve Beatrice,
[33491][33529]and now you will join us here forever|where you belong.
[33591][33601]Brother.
[33664][33685]I am not your brother.
[33687][33721]You're an animal, Dante.|A monster!
[33747][33770]I will not let you have her.
[33915][33946]You know I'm the better swordsman, Dante.
[34157][34197]It's over. Justice is inevitable.
[34200][34220]Not yet.
[34595][34616]He can rest for a while,
[34618][34669]but he is forever bound here|like a shadow of time unforgotten.
[34671][34697]He was a good man.
[34698][34722]He doesn't deserve such suffering.
[34723][34765]Heavenly Father,|let the soul of Francesco rise
[34766][34791]into your divine Paradise.
[34812][34827]What?
[34844][34876]Pray for your own soul, Dante,
[34877][34919]for it will freeze with me forever|in Cocytus below.
[34920][34946]I'll kill you in your own circle, Devil.
[34947][34973]Yes, a contest.
[34974][35025]Hurry, Dante. Your beloved Beatrice|is soon my queen.
[35144][35174]This is the union|of the three great rivers of Hell.
[35294][35316]Another beast I must slay?
[35330][35367]No, Dante. Geryon is our passage|to the eighth circle.
[35372][35407]Climb inside. And be wary - it bites.
[35517][35533]My thanks, Geryon.
[35534][35554]This way, Dante.
[35573][35595]We are in the circle of Fraud
[35596][35630]which one commits|upon those who trust in him.
[35669][35694]You must travel these ten malebolge alone.
[35695][35722]And quickly - Beatrice is soon to wed.
[35723][35757]Alone? What of you, great poet?
[35759][35778]I will not be far, believe me.
[35780][35798]You have proven yourself worthy.
[35800][35845]Now hurry, Dante,|lest you lose your love forever.
[35868][35902]I traveled on alone,|over the flatterers and simonists,
[35903][35933]and as I ran I was overwhelmed|with my sins
[35934][35966]as if every malebolge|was a chasm of memory.
[35967][35992]I felt my mind weakening with every step,
[35993][36018]and yet I would not cease.
[36069][36106]Release that one.|His ransom has been paid.
[36117][36131]My ransom?
[36132][36169]No. No, you didn't...
[36170][36199]You defiled yourself with him, didn't you?
[36200][36230]Didn't you? You whore.
[36231][36249]You have shamed me.
[36250][36267]You are not my wife, do you hear?
[36268][36293]Filthy whore. Whore!
[36318][36352]I'll kill you. You bastard dog, I'll kill you.
[36353][36373]I swear I'll kill you.
[36394][36444]You bastard. You'll see everyone|you ever loved dead by my hand.
[36446][36466]Dead, dead!
[36479][36507]No, it can't be.
[36618][36639]I have come for the woman.
[36640][36654]No!
[36685][36717]Leave her alone. She's innocent.
[36718][36738]Run, Beatrice, run!
[36748][36771]Get out of my house, filthy dog.
[36850][36881]- Get away from me!|- There is no escape for you.
[36882][36903]Stay back.
[36921][36937]No!
[37076][37105]Vengeance is finally mine.
[37148][37184]It was me. Beatrice's death.
[37185][37208]They were all murdered because of me.
[37209][37249]At last, Dante, now you both see the truth.
[37251][37286]You are the true cause of|Beatrice's suffering,
[37287][37320]and the damnation of so many others.
[37321][37348]How could you have done such evil to me?
[37349][37390]Tear the heart from my chest,|rip the very soul from my body?
[37392][37423]These sins are my own.
[37425][37446]You have no right to Beatrice.
[37447][37466]Relinquish her.
[37520][37553]Never! Dwellers, night fiends,
[37554][37574]and torturers of the pit,
[37575][37611]strip the flesh from the mortal's bones.
[37612][37628]Lucifer!
[37772][37804]Beatrice, stop!|You don't know what you're doing!
[37814][37832]I thought I knew many things.
[37833][37882]I thought love was real,|but it was only an illusion, a fraud.
[37883][37920]There is nothing left for me|in all of God's crwation.
[37973][37988]Yes, my love.
[37989][38025]In union, all of Hell's power will be yours.
[38026][38050]Beatrice, don't do it!
[38084][38127]When you had your way with that girl,|you gave me to Lucifer.
[38128][38151]It was all because of you.
[38168][38183]Beatrice!
[38227][38241]No!
[38242][38262]No, no.
[38289][38320]The faithful has lost her faith.
[38321][38357]The incorruptible|has become corrupted.
[38358][38406]The true innocent has given way|to the sins of man,
[38407][38436]like all the rest before her.
[38437][38475]Who can now deny me my rights?
[38570][38602]I will leave you with my consort.
[38616][38648]She has so much to show you.
[38754][38784]This is where you belong, Dante.
[38785][38812]You are the greatest fraud of all.
[38813][38839]You've lied to me, deceived me,
[38840][38875]and for that you shall suffer.
[38896][38916]Beatrice, don't do this.
[38992][39009]You never loved me.
[39010][39030]It was all a lie, all of it...
[39031][39052]our whole life!
[39114][39158]Beatrice, listen to me.|I braved the circles of Hell for you.
[39159][39184]You mean nothing to me.
[39185][39229]But I have faced my sins.|I am ready to take you home.
[39230][39266]Faced your sins? Look down, Dante.
[39267][39293]Look deep into the ninth circle...
[39328][39351]the circle of traitors.
[39411][39444]God in Heaven, what happened?
[39445][39486]Who is responsible|for this massacre?
[39505][39542]Take care of my sister.|I am responsible.
[39564][39608]Hang him, and prepare to march tonight.
[39610][39660]When the noble Saladin|learns of this atrocity
[39661][39691]he will bring forth the very forces of Hell.
[39701][39720]Take care of Beatrice.
[39721][39747]Dante, protect her with your life.
[39816][39842]Beatrice, I'm coming home.
[39897][39934]I wanted nothing more|than to see you and beg for forgiveness.
[39935][39972]I will never forgive what you've done, never.
[39977][40007]But while I live, I can absolve you.
[40008][40041]Forgive me, and free yourself.
[40050][40073]My cross.
[40074][40098]I brought it back to you.
[40099][40131]Accept again the love of God.
[40265][40282]Dante.
[40339][40357]I forgive you.
[40358][40397]I never wanted any harm to come to you.
[40488][40515]You have done well, my friend.
[40516][40547]And though you may not|understand it now, Dante,
[40548][40601]you have perhaps saved far more|than just one innocent soul.
[40637][40677]Wait. I can't be separated from her now.|I've come this far.
[40679][40709]You cannot claim|a place with her yet, Dante.
[40716][40760]You have to face the true enemy,|in the lowest part of the ninth circle...
[40761][40781]the circle of traitors.
[40782][40831]There, you must face the king of traitors,|Lucifer himself.
[40832][40865]He guards your only escape|from the Inferno.
[40873][40914]We shall be reunited one day. I promise.
[40927][40942]Goodbye, my love.
[40971][41009]This last trial is for you to face alone.
[41020][41039]Godspeed, my friend.
[41047][41084]Very well. I am coming for you, Lucifer.
[41086][41113]I will make you pay for her suffering.
[41121][41142]I am coming for you.
[41261][41286]I fell, not into fire,
[41315][41346]but into a vast, frozen wasteland.
[41360][41382]The very center of Hell,
[41407][41429]furthest place in all of creation
[41430][41454]from the divine light of God.
[41474][41520]Treachery, the ninth circle|of the Inferno.
[41595][41642]I walked through the darkness,|numb with bitter cold.
[41671][41702]All about me were forsaken,
[41703][41753]frozen souls of deceivers and traitors.
[41811][41867]Who are you to walk the paths of Hell|so warmly, O living man?
[41868][41894]Damned soul, where is Lucifer?
[41896][41929]Tell me, before I too freeze|in this miserable hell.
[41930][41994]Wipe the icy tears from my eyes,|and I shall tell you.
[42085][42122]The Lord of Hell dwells|at the center of this frozen lake.
[42123][42142]Past the storms of Ptolomea,
[42143][42171]deep in the center pit of Judecca,
[42172][42197]there his icy halls are well protected,
[42198][42238]and none but the mightiest|may cleave a path.
[42239][42265]But can you believe me?
[42266][42287]Can you believe a traitor?
[42333][42374]Long did I wander|the dim and icy paths of Hell.
[42410][42436]Past the frozen giants of legend...
[42437][42482]Nimrod, Ephialtes and Antaeus.
[42499][42522]I was battered by a frigid wind
[42523][42560]that was like the beating|of Lucifer's black wings.
[42605][42641]Finally, after a seeming eternity,
[42642][42700]I came to a passage blocked|by the frozen links of a mighty chain.
[42723][42753]Lucifer thinks he can block my way|with this?
[42754][42782]He thinks he can stay my vengeance?
[43132][43164]Welcome, great Dante.
[43165][43205]Welcome to your final resting place,
[43206][43226]the circle of traitors.
[43227][43257]Lucifer, I have come to escape this hell
[43259][43282]so that I may be reunited with my beloved,
[43284][43313]but not before I rid the world|of your corruption.
[43315][43343]You will never see Beatrice again.
[43344][43375]The path to Purgatory lies through me.
[43377][43416]You are the warrior|of a weak and dying God,
[43418][43441]a God who is the true evil.
[43442][43470]His power wanes over the world.
[43471][43510]Silence. Your lies|have no power over me, Devil.
[43511][43552]I will rend the very soul|from your frozen body.
[43553][43575]Indignant fool.
[43576][43606]Come, let me devour your soul
[43607][43633]as I devoured Judas Iscariot.
[43634][43689]You will remain in this pit|until creation's last breath, do you hear?
[43690][43710]Never!
[43720][43746]You are not invincible here.
[43747][43772]You are just another demon
[43773][43814]and, like any fallen, you can be destroyed.
[43830][43877]You cannot destroy me!
[44021][44048]What have you done to me?
[44149][44180]I have slain you, great beast.
[44181][44215]Victory is mine.
[44216][44234]What's this?
[44333][44358]New life writhes inside him.
[44359][44377]No!
[44461][44497]Thank you, Dante. I am very impressed.
[44499][44531]Many have tried, but all have failed me.
[44532][44567]Ulysses, Alexander, Attila, Lancelot...
[44569][44605]Truly, you are the greatest of all my minions.
[44614][44635]Minion? I do not serve you.
[44637][44666]Speak without your forked tongue, serpent!
[44675][44696]Do you not?
[44698][44737]You freed me|from my eternal torment.
[44738][44762]I came only for Beatrice.
[44763][44794]Beatrice? She was only bait.
[44795][44823]It was you I wanted all along.
[44824][44869]Don't you see?|I was bound by God in this frozen pit,
[44870][44904]only my shadow self allowed to roam free.
[44905][44947]It took a mortal to release me -|you, Dante.
[44954][44971]No, it isn't true!
[44972][44989]I defeated you before.
[44990][45031]Show me the path from Hell,|or I will end your miserable existence.
[45033][45058]Destroy an angel of God?
[45059][45080]You arrogant gnat.
[45082][45108]Such vanity, such pride.
[45110][45141]I could have slain you|the moment you fell into Hell.
[45247][45266]You worship God,
[45267][45295]but it was He who created evil.
[45297][45325]It was He who created me.
[45326][45371]If you knew the true nature of God, Dante,
[45372][45399]you too would rebel.
[45400][45412]No!
[45413][45455]You are nothing to me. A talking animal.
[45456][45483]He made you in His image...
[45507][45536]and I was to bow down to you?
[45688][45720]I grow weary of this game.
[46019][46069]Finally, I will reclaim|my proper place in Heaven.
[46072][46125]Behold, Dante.|Beyond the Inferno lies Purgatory,
[46126][46156]where awaits your precious Beatrice.
[46157][46196]But instead of you,|I shall escape from this pit.
[46197][46240]All the souls in Purgatory|shall suffer and burn.
[46241][46300]And beyond Purgatory, Paradise itself.
[46302][46338]I will plunge the cosmos into chaos,
[46340][46370]and it is all your doing, Dante.
[46371][46435]Because of you, God will finally|see me rule His creation.
[46436][46474]No, I cannot be the cause of this.
[46476][46513]There is nothing you can do|to stop me, mortal.
[46514][46544]No one can stop me.
[46546][46566]One can.
[46608][46656]Almighty God, forgive me|for all of my wicked sins.
[46657][46700]I forsake my escape.|I give up even Beatrice.
[46701][46720]I belong here, in Hell,
[46721][46745]and accept my just damnation.
[46746][46776]What are you doing?
[46777][46817]A repentant soul in Judecca? Stop!
[46818][46836]Do not utter a word!
[46837][46884]But grant me the power|to keep your enemy here with me.
[46895][46923]Stop. I command you.
[46924][46961]No!
[47351][47369]Purgatory.
[47629][47673]Beatrice. I will come to you yet.
[47674][47703]My love, I have forgiven you.
[47704][47754]God will forgive you.|Now forgive yourself.
[47843][47885]I fought across Earth and Hell|to find my beloved Beatrice.
[47899][47942]We were together,|neither in Hell nor in Paradise,
[47943][47974]neither damned nor saved.
[47975][48016]I did not die, and I did not live.

Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice

Everybody scream
In our town of Halloween
I am the clown with a tear-away face

Filling your dreams to the brim with fright

Whee

- We did it!
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!
Great Halloween, everybody.
I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.
No! Thanks to you, Jack.
Without your brilliant leadership--
- Not at all, Mayor.
- You're such a scream, Jack.
- You're a witch's fondest dream.
- You made walls fall, Jack.
Walls fall? You made the very mountains crack, Jack.
- The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go!
- You're not ready for so much excitement.
- Yes, I am!
- You're coming with me!
- No, I'm not!
Come back here, you foolish--
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh.
Ooh, Jack, you made wounds ooze and flesh crawl.
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Hold it. We haven't given out the prizes yet.
Our first award goes to the vampires... for most blood drained in a single evening.
Our second and honorable mention... goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon leeches.
Nice work, Bone Daddy.
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year... and the year before that, and the year before that.
There are few who deny at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort
Of my ghost-like charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With a wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet
Yet year after year
It's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And l, Jack the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing
Oh, somewhere deep
Inside of these bones
An emptiness
Began to grow
There's something out there
Far from my home
A longing that
I've never known
I'm the master of fright
And a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky
And I'm known throughout
England and France
And since I am dead
I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations
But who here
Would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown lf they only understood
He'd give it all up
If he only could
Oh, there's an empty
Place in my bones
That calls out for
Something unknown
The fame and praise
Come year after year
Does nothing for
These empty tears
Jack.
I know how you feel.
Sally!
You've come back.
- I had to.
- For this!
- Yes.
- Shall we, then?
That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea and run off.
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know!
I made you with my own hands.
You can make other creations.
I'm restless. I can't help it.
It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.
We need to be patient, that's all.
But I don't want to be patient.
No, Zero, not now.
I'm not in the mood.
All right.
Here you go, boy.
Mornin', gents!
Jack, you home?
Jack, I've got the plans for next Halloween.
I need to go over them with you so we can get started.
Jack, please! I'm only an elected official here.
I can't make decisions by myself.
Jack, answer me!
- Huh?
- He's not home.
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.
Where are we?
It's someplace new!
What is this?
Whoa-oa-oa!
Whoa!
What's this, what's this
There's color everywhere
What's this
There's white things in the air
What's this, I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this
What's this, what's this
There's something very wrong
What's this, there's people singing songs, what's this
The streets are lined with little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this
What's this
There's children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys and absolutely no one's dead
There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones
I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside
Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe
They kiss, why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this
What's this in here
They've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why
They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings and there's a smile on everyone
So now correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this
Oh my, what now
The children are asleep
But look
There's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them or ensnare them
Only little cozy things secure inside their dreamland
What's this
The monsters are all missing and the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be good feeling all around
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies are absolutely everywhere
The sights, the sounds they're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know, I've got to know what is this place that I have found
What is this
Christmas Town?
Hmm.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hmm.
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.
Stand aside. Coming through.
We've got to find Jack!
There's only 365 days left till next Halloween!
Three sixty-four!
Is there anywhere we've forgotten to check?
I looked in every mausoleum.
We opened the sarcophagi!
I tromped through the pumpkin patch.
I peeked behind the cyclops' eye.
I did! But he wasn't there.
It's time to sound the alarms!
Frog's breath will overpower any odor.
Bitter!
Worm's wart. But where, where is that worm's wart?
Sally? ls that soup ready yet?
Ah. Coming!
Lunch!
Ah, what's that?
Worm's wart! Mmm!
And frog's breath?
Wh-What's wrong? l-l thought you liked frog's breath.
Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath.
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.
I'm not hungry. Oops.
You want me to starve... an old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is.
Me, to whom you owe your very life.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mmm! See? Scrumptious!
Did anyone think to dredge the lake?
Oh, this morning.
- Hear that?
- Ah, what?
- Shh.
Zero!
- Jack's back!
- Jack's back! Jack's back!
- Where have you been?
- Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.
- When?
- Immediately!
Town meeting! Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
Listen, everyone!
I want to tell you about Christmas Town.
There were objects so peculiar they were not to be believed
All around things to tantalize my brain
It's a world unlike anything
I've ever seen
And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream
But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you.
Ooh!
This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box
- A box
- Is it steel
- Are there locks
- Is it filled with a pox
- A pox, how delightful, a pox
If you please.
Just a box with bright colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow
- A bow
- But why
- How ugly
- What's in it, what's in it
That's the point of the thing
Not to know
- It's a bat
- Will it bend
- It's a rat
- Will it break
Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake
Listen now
You don't understand
That's not the point of Christmasland
Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock
And hang it like this on the wall
Oh, yes, does it still have a foot
- Let me see, let me look
- Is it rotted and covered with gook
Um, let me explain.
There's no foot inside but there's candy
- Or sometimes it's filled with small toys
- Small toys
- Do they bite
- Do they snap
- Or explode in the sack
Well, perhaps they just spring out and scare girls and boys
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once
Everyone, please
Now not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
I don't know.
Do you get it?
Well, I may as well give them what they want.
And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmasland
Is a fearsome king with a deep, mighty voice
Least, that's what
I've come to understand
And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster huge and red
When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is so I've heard it said
And on a dark cold night under full moonlight
He flies into a fog like a vulture in the sky
And they call him
Sandy Claws
Well, at least they're excited
But they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmasland
Oh, well.
Hmm.
Hmm.
There's got to be a logical way to explain this Christmas thing.
You've poisoned me for the last time, you wretched girl.
Oh, my head!
The door is open!
- Hello!
- Jack Skellington!
- Up here, my boy.
- Doctor, I need to borrow some equipment.
Is that so? Whatever for?
I'm conducting a series of experiments.
How perfectly marvelous!
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.
Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up.
Hmm. Experiments?
Zero, I'm home!
Interesting reaction!
But what does it mean?
You can come out now if you promise to behave.
Sally?
Sally?
Oh, gone again!
Hmm.
Oh!
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Don't know if we're ever going to get him back
He's all alone up there locked away inside
- Never says a word
- Hope he hasn't died
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Christmastime is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be
I cannot tell
There's so many things
I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip
Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant
Gone in a flash
What does it mean
What does it mean
In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though
Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see
What does it mean
What does it mean
What does it mean
Hmm. Hmm.
I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them
Something's wrong
It's so hard to put my bony finger on
Or perhaps it's really not as deep as I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard
Of course
I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me
It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it
You know I think this Christmas thing is not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone
Not anyone in fact, but me
Why I can make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmastime
I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Eureka!
This year,
Christmas will be ours!
Patience, everyone. Jack has a special job for each of you.
Dr. Beetlestein.
Your Christmas assignment is ready.
Dr. Beetlestein, to the front of the line.
What kind of noise is that for a baby to make?
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem!
I knew it!
Doctor, thank you for coming.
We need some of these.
Hmm.
Their construction should be exceedingly simple, I think.
How horrible our Christmas will be.
No! How jolly!
Oh. How jolly our Christmas will be.
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.
- Specifically.
- By name.
- Lock.
- Shock.
- Barrel.
Jack, Jack, it's Boogie's boys.
Ah, Halloween's finest trick or treaters.
The job I have for you is top secret.
It requires craft, cunning, mischief.
And we thought you didn't like us, Jack.
Absolutely no one is to know about it. Not a soul!
Now.
Tree.
Christmas Town.
Ow! Hmm.
And one more thing.
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!
Whatever you say, Jack.
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws
- I wanna do it
- Let's draw straws
- Jack said we should work together
- Three of a kind
- Birds of a feather
- Now and forever
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then turn off all the lights
First we're going to set some bait inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate
Wait, I've got a better plan to catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks
And Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased I do declare
That he will cook him rare
Whee
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more
You're so stupid
Think now if we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
- If I were on his boogie list
- I'd get out of town
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too
I'll bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
We're his little henchmen and we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him and stay on his good side
- I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
- I'm not the dumb one
- You're no fun
- Shut up
- Make me
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now in the box we'll wait and hide until his curiosity
Entices him to look inside and then we'll have him one, two, three
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick
Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key
Sandy Claws, huh?
It goes something like this.
How about it?
Think you can manage?
A-one, and a-two, and a-three, and a--
- Next!
- Fantastic!
Now, why don't you all practice on that, and we'll be in great shape.
Sally, I need your help more than anyone's.
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.
- There was smoke and fire.
- That's not my Christmas.
My Christmas is filled with laughter and joy.
And this: my Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.
Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.
This part's red.
The trim is white.
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.
Who else is clever enough to make my Sandy Claws outfit?
- Next!
- I have...
- Oh.
- every confidence in you.
But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.
This device is called a nutcracker.
Jack! Jack! We caught 'im!
We got 'im!
Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!
That's not Sandy Claws!
- It isn't?
- Who is it?
- Bunny!
- Eek! Ooh.
Not Sandy Claws! Take him back!
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.
Which door?
There's more than one.
Sandy Claws is behind the door shaped like this.
I told you!
- You knock it off!
- Get-- Ow! Ow!
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
Take him home first!
And apologize again.
Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him.
- Treat him nicely.
- Got it.
We'll get it right next time.
You will be a decided improvement... over that treacherous Sally.
Master. The plans.
Excellent, lgor.
- What?
- What's goin' on?
This time
This time
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Making Christmas is so fine
It's ours this time
And won't the children be surprised
It's ours this time
- Making Christmas
- Making Christmas
- Making Christmas
Time to give them something fun
They'll talk about for years to come
- Let's have a cheer from everyone
- It's time to party
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Snakes and mice get wrapped up so nice
With spider legs and pretty bows
It's ours this time
All together that and this
With all our tricks we're making Christmastime
Here comes Jack.
I don't believe what's happening to me
My hopes, my dreams
My fantasies
Won't they be impressed
I am a genius
See how I transform this old rat
Into a most delightful hat
- Hmm.
- My compliments from me to you on this your most intriguing hat
- Consider though this substitute
A bat in place of this old rat
- Huh!
No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present
It's been dead for much too long
Try something fresher
Something pleasant
Try again
Don't give up
All together that and this
With all our tricks we're making Christmastime
- This time, this time
- It's ours
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
La, la, la
It's almost here and we can't wait
So ring the bells and celebrate
'Cause when the full moon starts to climb, we'll all sing out
It's Christmastime
Kathleen, Bobby, Susie.
Yes, Susie's been nice.
Nice, nice, naughty, nice, nice, nice--
There are hardly any naughty children this year.
Now, who could that be?
- Trick or treat!
- Huh?
Ya!
You don't look like yourself,
Jack, not at all.
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!
But you're the Pumpkin King!
Not anymore.
And I feel so much better now!
Jack, I know you think something's missing, but--
- Ow!
- Sorry.
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?
I've got the beard, the coat, the boots, the belt--
- Jack, Jack, this time we bagged him.
- This time we really did!
- He sure is big, Jack!
- And heavy!
Let me out!
Sandy Claws in person!
What a pleasure to meet you!
Wh-- Why, you have hands!
- You don't have claws at all!
- Wha--
Where am l?
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.
You don't need to have another worry about Christmas this year.
- Wha-- Well, wha-- Wha--
- Consider this a vacation,
Sandy, a reward.
- It's your turn to take it easy.
- B-But there must be some mistake!
See that he's comfortable.
Just a second, fellas. Of course!
- That's what I'm missing!
- B-B-but--
- Thanks.
- Y-You just can't--
Hold on.
Where are we going now?
Ho, ho, ho! No.
- This is worse than I thought.
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Much worse.
- Ho, ho, ho!
- I know.
Me, on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?
To Oogie Boogie, of course.
There isn't anywhere in the whole world more comfortable than that.
- And Jack said to make him comfortable, didn't he?
- Yes, he did.
Haven't you heard of peace on earth and goodwill toward men?
No!
Ah! This'll stop Jack.
What a joy to think of all we'll have in common.
We'll have conversations worth having!
Don't do this!
Naughty children never get any presents!
- I think he might be too big!
- Ooh!
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney... he can fit down here.
Well, well, well!
What have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about.
You're jokin'
You're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now if I don't die laughin' first
Mr. Oogie Boogie says there's trouble close at hand
You better pay attention now
'cause I'm the boogie man
And if you aren't shakin' there's somethin' very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time you hear the boogie song
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- I'm the Oogie Boogie man
- He's the Oogie Boogie man
Release me now or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses
Ah, you're jokin'
You're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny
I'm laughin'
You really are too much
And now with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna do the best I can.
Whoa
The sound of rolling dice to me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' boogie man although I don't play fair
It's much more fun
I must confess with lives on the line
Not mine, of course
But yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine
Release me fast or you will have to answer for this heinous act
Oh, brother, you're somethin'
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending the position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't goin' nowhere
Whoa! It's Jack!
Think of us as you soar triumphantly through the sky... outshining every star... your silhouette a dark blot on the moon.
You, who are our pride.
You, who are our glory.
- You, who have frightened millions into an early grave.
- Ow!
You, who have, uh... devastated the, the souls of the living?
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.
- The reindeer can't see an inch in front of their noses.
- Whew!
This fog's as thick as, as--
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!
There go all of my hopes... my precious plans, my glorious dreams.
There goes Christmas.
No, Zero. Down, boy.
My, what a brilliant nose you have!
The better to light my way!
To the head of the team, Zero!
We're off!
Wait, Jack! No!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!
Good-bye, Jack.
My dearest Jack.
Oh, how I hope my premonition is wrong.
I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice
My feelings for him
And will he see
How much he means to me
I think it's not to be
What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may it doesn't last
And will we ever
End up together
No, I think not
It's never to become
For I am not the one
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Santa!
Santa?
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?
- Uh, uh, uh, uh--
- That's all right.
I have a special present for you anyway. There you go, sonny.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
And what did Santa bring you, honey?
Merry Christmas!
Hello. Police.
Attacked by Christmas toys?
That's strange. That's the second toy complaint we've had.
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Huh?
Oh, wait!
Whoa! Help! Help!
You're welcome, one and all!
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.
Police. I know. I know.
A skeleton. Keep calm.
Turn off all the lights. Make sure the doors are locked. Hello. Police.
Reports are pouring in from all over the globe... that an impostor is shamelessly impersonating Santa Claus... mocking and mangling this joyous holiday.
Authorities assure us that at this moment... military units are mobilizing to stop the perpetrator of this heinous crime.
- Jack! Someone has to help Jack.
- Wherever you are...
- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- come back and save Christmas.
Look, Zero, searchlights!
They're celebrating!
They're thanking us for doing such a good job.
Whoa! Careful down there.
You almost hit us!
It's okay, Zero. Head higher.
Are you a gamblin' man, Sandy?
Let's play. Hmm?
My, my! What have we here?
I'll get you out of here.
Ah. Lovely.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Uh, tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
What? You try to make a dupe out of me!
Oh!
Who's next on my list?
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?
They're trying to hit us. Zero!
Merry Christmas to all... and to all a good night!
I knew this Christmas thing was a bad idea.
I felt it in my gut.
Terrible news, folks.
The worst tragedy of our times.
Jack has been blown to smithereens!
Terrible, terrible news!
Attention. Attention, citizens.
Terrible news. There's still no sign of Santa Claus.
Although the impostor has been shot down... it looks like Christmas will have to be cancelled this year.
I repeat, the impostor has been shot down... but there's still no sign yet of Santa.
What have I done
What have I done
How could I
Be so blind
All is lost
Where was I
Spoiled all
Spoiled all
Everything's
Gone all wrong
What have I done
What have I done
Find a deep cave to hide in
In a million years
They'll find me only dust
And a plaque that reads
Here lies poor old Jack
But I never intended all this madness
Never
And nobody really understood
Well, how could they
That all I ever wanted was to bring them something great
Why does nothing ever turn out like it should
Well, what the heck
I went and did my best
And by god
I really tasted something swell
And for a moment why, I even touched the sky
And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did
And for the first time since I don't remember when
I felt just like my old bony self again
And l, Jack
The Pumpkin King
That's right, I am the Pumpkin King
Ha-ha-ha-ha
And I just can't wait until next Halloween
'Cause I've got some new ideas that will really make them scream
And by god I'm really going to give it all my might
Uh-oh. I hope there's still time... to set things right.
Sandy Claws! Hmm.
You wait 'til Jack hears about this!
By the time he's through with you, you'll be lucky if you--
The King of Halloween... has been blown to smithereens.
Skeleton Jack is now a pile of dust.
Come on, Zero.
Christmas isn't over yet.
What's that you said about luck, rag doll?
Help! Help! Help!
Shh.
Looks like it's Oogie's turn to boogie now.
- Help!
- One, two, three... four, five, six, seven.
Help!
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
Oh, I'm feeling weak with hunger!
One more roll of the dice oughta do it.
What? Snake eyes?
Eleven!
Looks like I won the jackpot!
Bye-bye, doll face and sandman.
What the--
- Hello, Oogie.
- J-J-J-Jack!
But they said you were dead.
You must be double dead!
Oh!
Well, come on, bone man!
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha!
Fire!
Hmm. Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Jack, look out!
So long, Jack.
How dare you treat my friends so shamefully!
Now look what you've done!
My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs!
Forgive me, Mr. Claws.
I'm afraid I've made a terrible mess of your holiday.
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?
The next time you get the urge to take over someone else's holiday, I'd listen to her.
She's the only one who makes any sense around this insane asylum.
- Skeletons! Boogie men! Ooh.
- I hope there's still time.
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!
I'm Santa Claus.
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.
How did you get down here, Sally?
Oh, l-l was trying to--
Well, I wanted to, to--
- To help me.
- I couldn't let you just--
Sally, I can't believe
I never realized that you--
- Jack! Jack!
- Here he is!
- Alive!
- Just like we said!
- Grab ahold, my boy!
Whoa!
Good news, folks. Santa Claus, the one and only, has finally been spotted.
Old Saint Nick appears to be traveling at supersonic speed.
He's setting things right, bringing joy and cheer wherever he goes.
Yes, folks, Kris Kringle has pulled it out of the bag... and delivered Christmas to excited children all over the world.
La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la
- Jack!
- Jack's back!
- Jack?
- Jack's okay!
- He's all right!
- It's Jack!
Jack's okay
And he's back
Oh, yea
He's all right
Let's shout, make a fuss
Scream it out, whee
Jack is back now
Everyone sing
In the town of Halloween
- It's great to be home!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Happy Halloween!
Merry Christmas!
- What's this
- What's this
- I haven't got a clue
- What's this
- Why, it's completely new
What's this
Must be a Christmas thing
- What's this
- It's really very strange
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
What's this
What's this
Careful, my precious jewel.
My dearest friend if you don't mind
I'd like to join you by your side
Where we can gaze into the stars
And sit together
Now and forever
For it is plain
As anyone can see
We're simply meant to be
Ichabod and Mr Toad
Ichabod
Ichabod and Mr Toad
Ichabod, Ichabod and Mr Toad...
If you chose the most fabulous character in English literature,
who would it be?
Robin Hood? King Arthur?
Becky Sharp?
Sherlock Holmes?
Oliver Twist, perhaps?
Any one of them would be an excellent choice.
But as the most fabulous character of all, I nominate
a toad.
J Thaddeus Toad, Esquire.
Have you never met him?
You'll find his story in
"The Wind in the Willows".
Toad was the one disturbing element.
Incurable adventurer, mad, reckless, tried everything.
A positive mania for fads, and he never counted the cost.
He had a host of fair-weather friends.
But there were only three who had his best interests at heart.
One was a badger. MacBadger.
And then there was a water rat.
A bit stuffy, perhaps, but really a fine fellow. And a mole.
A gentle creature, kind and sympathetic.
They all made their homes in a quaint community along a riverbank.
On that particular day, Mole was in a hurry because...
 because he was late for tea.
A regrettable habit, but Rat had learned to put up with it.
Sorry, says Mole. Quite alright, says Rat. Two lumps?
Then, just as they were getting settled...
- Special Delivery, Mr Rat.
- Thank you, Postman.
How's everything on the river, sir?
Dashed quiet, as usual, thank you.
Mole, listen.
"Dear Rat: You and Mole must come to Toad Hall at once."
"Urgent!! A MacBadger."
Rat was certain Toad was making trouble again.
The answer to that lay just around the bend at Toad Hall,
the ancestral home of
J Thaddeus himself.
This impressive structure was the finest home on the river.
The animals were tremendously proud of it.
They felt it gave the whole community an air of respectability.
To lose Toad Hall was, of course, unthinkable,
and yet it was no secret that Toad's follies
had brought him to the brink of bankruptcy.
So, MacBadger had volunteered to put Toad's house in order.
Smashed fence. Two guineas.
Damage, lamp post. Four pound six.
Destruction of hen house...
How can a man figure with all this hubbub?
- I'll not be put off!
- Pay my bill!
- I want my money!
- Silence!
You'll get your money in due course.
Now, go along with you.
I'll pay no more today.
Why did I assume the responsibility of looking after...
Didn't I tell you...?
It's you, Rat. And Mole, too.
Thank goodness, lads.
You've come at last.
Poor MacBadger. He'd reached the end of his rope.
As he said himself...
I'm practically a nervous wreck.
I say! What seems to be the trouble?
Summat's got to be done about Toad!
This time he's gone too far!
But he promised us...
Promises? What good are promises when wild manias take him?
Now, look, you're his closest friends, are you not?
- Yes.
- Very dear friends.
Then you must find
Toad and stop him!
- What's he doing?
- He's got a new mania.
He's rampaging about the county in a canary-yellow gypsy cart.
With a horse named Cyril.
Tally-ho!
Are we on our way to Nottingham, to Brittingham, to Buckingham
Or any hammy hamlet by the sea? No!
Are we on our way to Devonshire, to Lancashire or Worcestershire?
I'm not so sure
We'll have to wait and see
Are we on our way to Dover?
Or going merrily over
The jolly old road that goes to Plymouth Ho?
No! We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
On our way to nowhere in particular
We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way
Though the roads are perpendicular
- We're always in a hurry
- We have no time to stall
We've gotta be there
We've gotta be there
But where, we can't recall
We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way
And we may be going to Devonshire, to Lancashire, to Worcestershire
We're not so sure, but what do we care?
We're only sure we've got to be there
We're merrily on our way to nowhere at all
Hello, you fellows!
You're the very animals
I was coming to see!
Come along! Hop up!
We'll go for a jolly ride!
The open road, the dusty highway. Come!
I'll show you the world.
Travel, change, excitement...
How stupid of me! I want you fellows to meet my noble steed Cyril.
Aye, that's me.
A bit of a trotter, a bit of a rotter.
How do you do, how do you do, how do you do?
How do you do?
Say, guv'nor, your friends seem a bit on the stuffy side.
Toad, we want to have a talk with you.
A visit! Splendid!
This is serious. You must give up that horse and cart.
Give up my... But my dear
Ratty, this is my career!
- You can't mean...
- I do!
- You must stop this foolishness!
- No.
- You must!
- No. I won't do it.
Your reckless behaviour is giving animals a bad name!
You're becoming a menace to society.
At least think of poor MacBadger!
And as for that horse, no good will come of gadding about with such a fast and irresponsible beast!
- Get him, Mole!
- Come down, Toady.
Stop it! Let me go!
Giddy up, Cyril! Giddy up!
It's no use. You'll never get me to give this up!
Tally-ho! Yikes!
Look!
Gad! What is it?
- Lummy, guv'nor, it's a motorcar.
- Motorcar?
A motorcar... Gad! What have I been missing?
- Ratty, it isn't... He hasn't...
- It is, and he has.
A new mania. Motor mania.
Mania.
That's it. That's what it was.
A positive mania.
No telling where it would end.
Might linger for months.
And with Toad Hall at stake,
Rat and Mole had no choice.
Only one thing to do.
Lock the poor chap up until the poison worked out of his system.
Hold him, Moley!
- That's better.
- And you can't escape.
Simply no use trying.
Let me out! Open up, I say! Please!
Open the door!
Playing jailer to one's dearest friend wasn't pleasant.
In fact, Moley immediately wanted to call it quits, but Ratty said no.
This time they must be firm.
It wasn't just a matter of saving Toad from himself.
There was MacBadger to consider, and
Toad Hall and all it stood for.
There was only one thing wrong with Ratty's cure for motor mania.
It didn't work. You see,
Toad was far too clever.
And, at the moment, completely mad.
He was determined to get a motorcar,
even if he had to beg, borrow or...
Toad arrested! Extra!
His Majesty versus J
Thaddeus Toad, Toad Hall,
Riverbank, Doodle-Bunton-
Maxon-Morton, Surrey.
24th day of August, set forth in the following brief.
Accused is J Thaddeus Toad, of stealing a motorcar, and with it, endangering sundry subjects of His Majesty,
- their life and limbs.
- Counsel for the Crown, proceed with the case.
My lord, I call, as first Crown witnesses,
Mr Rat and Mr Mole!
Is it true that you had the accused locked in his own house because he had threatened to get a motorcar?
Did you, or did you not, have him locked up?
- We did.
- Thank you! That is all!
- Next witness.
- Mr Angus MacBadger!
As trustee of the Toad estate, you knew of the prisoner's mania for motorcars?
And due to his extravagance, you cut off his allowance?
Then he was, to the best of your knowledge, without funds?
That is all! Thank you!
Gentlemen of the jury, the Crown rests.
Counsel for the defence will present his case.
My lord, with the court's indulgence,
I rise prepared to plead my own defence.
Stop it.
Gentlemen of the jury...
I call, as my first witness, Cyril Proudbottom.
Are you acquainted with the defendant, J Thaddeus Toad?
Lord love a duck, yes! He's one of the jolliest chaps I've run across.
And simply tons of money.
Good fellow? Throws it away.
But he wasn't throwing it away that day!
You heard Mr MacBadger testify that his allowance was cut off.
Then how did he get a motorcar?
The only way a gentleman gets anything.
- The honest way.
- And what is the honest way?
I thought you wouldn't know!
Your Lordship, I...
The witness may testify in his own words.
Righto, guv'nor.
I'll just give you the facts.
When Toady escaped from his boudoir he headed straight for my place.
Soon we was off down the highway,
but we hadn't gone far, I confess, when, with a rush and a roar...
 something passed like the London Express.
It was big, it was red, it was beautiful.
A motorcar, a bit of alright.
Toady was transfixed with... rapture.
You could tell it was love at first sight.
The motor pulled up to a tavern, wherein was located a bar.
And we watched while some tough-looking weasels
got out of that lovely red car.
Now, weasels, I know, are deceitful.
And not to be trusted, at all.
But how could I know they'd stolen that car?
I didn't have no crystal ball.
The guv'nor is not one to dally.
He made up his mind like a flash. He says...
Try it for size, my good Cyril,
while I see what they'll take for it, cash.
Into the tavern he saunters, where the barman was back of the bar.
And he said,
Cheerio, tavern keeper. Who's the owner of that... hot-looking car?
The barman, a codger named Winky, leaned over the bar and said,
- Why?
- The guv'nor answered,
That car must be mine!
Whatever the price is, I'll buy.
But Toad found he hadn't no money.
So, he promptly offered a trade.
The weasels appeared to be willing.
In a moment, the bargain was made.
Toady drawed up a paper, with almost incredible speed.
He called on old Winky the barman
to... pop over and witness the deed.
Now, the guv'nor is not a bit stingy.
He never does anything small.
The weasels gave him the red motorcar, and he gave the weasels Toad Hall.
Traded Toad Hall? An estate worth £100,000 for a motorcar?
You expect me to believe that?
I don't expect you to believe anything.
Fortunately, I can produce a witness. Call Mr Winky!
My lord, gentlemen, facing you in the witness box is a citizen of substance and standing.
A man of unimpeachable honesty.
Now, Mr Winky, do you recall an incident that took place in your... establishment last August 12th, that I was a party to?
Yes, sir, that I do.
Well, then... just tell the court what actually happened.
Well, guv'nor, you tried to sell me a stolen motorcar.
That's a deliberate lie, you monkey-faced rum pot!
I've been framed! Let me go! Help!
Toad guilty!
Toad's disgrace rocked the nation.
The court was determined to make an example of him.
Toad's friends tried to help him, but were always blocked.
They must've reopened the case a dozen times.
Appeals to this court, that court any court. But the decision stood.
The case of J Thaddeus
Toad was closed.
Merry, merry Christmas time
Bind every heart with happiness
Let everyone...
Yes, once again, it was a white Christmas.
Melodies of Yuletide hung sweet upon the winter's air.
Hearts were gay and spirits high.
Indeed, in all the city,
only one spot was untouched by the warmth of Christmas cheer.
The Tower, grim monument to
despair. Cold, cruel, forbidding,
and the abode of Toad for a good many Christmases to come.
Poor Toad. Alone with memories of his wasted life.
What a fool he'd been!
With many a pang he recalled the kindly face of Angus MacBadger,
and his sage advice, so often scorned.
A tear for Moley, too, for his loyalty, sympathy, understanding.
Toad wept for Rat, and all those little lectures so often laughed at.
Yes, within the dark confines of his miserable cell,
a new Toad was born. A reformed
Toad, a repentant Toad.
In a flood of remorse, he vowed to forsake the follies
of the Primrose path.
Never again would he give way to those mad, foolish manias
that had brought him to this sorry end.
As it's Christmas, you're allowed a visitor.
- Your grandma's here.
- Grandma?
Merry Christmas, sonny!
Granny wouldn't forget her little Toady boy!
Look, Christmas gift.
- What is it?
- Don't you get it?
A disguise.
All you've got to do is put on this natty little costume and...
Alas for good intentions.
Toad was incurable.
One whispered word and all his high resolve
vanished in the mad whirl of this new adventure.
This new mania! Escape!
Toad's escaped!
Halt!
Good evening, ma'am.
Good evening to you, Officer.
We're merrily, merrily, merrily...
Begging your pardon, but you...
You fellows, do you see him?
Gad, what perfectly ripping luck!
Trap Toad, would they?
Never!
- There he goes!
- Where?
Over there!
Blockheads! Let them scour the countryside.
Once more, J Thaddeus
Toad had the last laugh.
That Christmas Eve, along the riverbank,
the name of Toad was banned from conversation,
lest the memory of his disgrace becloud the merriment of the season.
Yet there was one home, at least, in which two loyal hearts
still held the warmth of Christian charity.
Bless this good food we are about to enjoy.
Bless us, every one.
And... bless poor Toad.
And may he get time off for good behaviour.
Why, it's a poor old lady.
Let's take her over by the fire.
What are you doing here?
I was just sort of...
Well, this is a merry Christmas!
But... aren't you afraid of the police?
Afraid of the police?
I, Toad, afraid of the police?
- Open up, I say!
- The police!
Hide me, Ratty!
Sorry, but you owe a debt to society.
And you've got to pay.
Mole, let them in.
But, Ratty, don't you think, maybe...
Open the door!
Hi, lads!
I've just made a very important discovery.
Toad Hall is ablaze with lights
and in possession of a pack of weasels.
And the leader of the gang is none other than Mr...
Winky!
Hip, hip...
Hooray!
And so, you see, he did trade Toad Hall for the motorcar!
- Toad was innocent all the time.
- Aye, lads.
And if he were only here right now...
- Toad!
- Angus!
Sorry, Toad, I misjudged you.
I hope, someday, you'll find it in your heart...
Not another word.
To err is human, to forgive...
Not so fast!
You're still guilty in the eyes of the law.
To prove your innocence, we've got to get that paper away from Winky!
Now, I have a plan.
We'll sneak in through the secret tunnel.
It was an expert plan, cunningly contrived but extremely dangerous.
It would work only if each did his part. There was no margin for error.
The odds against them were tremendous, but the stakes were high.
But now, steady's the word...
One false move and four lives hang in the balance.
Careful, lads. There is a guard.
- I'll pop him off!
- Don't shoot!
Who goes there?
That was a close one.
Trust Toad to start things off on the wrong foot.
No turning back now. Nothing for it but to push on.
What new and greater perils lay ahead, no one could say.
Toad had already got out of hand, so anything could happen.
Look. They're all asleep.
Lads, they're drunk.
They've been hitting the bottle.
But where is Winky?
There he is!
He's got the paper on him!
We'll have to climb up on the balcony.
The paper! It's gone!
Get him, you blokes!
I beg your pardon!
Over here!
After it!
- Just one more!
- There he is! Get him!
Where's Moley?
Well, laddies, we saved our skins, but we didn't get the deed.
Well done!
Hip, hip, hooray!
So, it was a happy ending, after all.
Toad's friends were dreadfully proud of him. And why not?
He was a new Toad, completely reformed,
through with gypsy carts and motorcars for ever.
And so, on this happiest of New
Years, a toast was in order.
- To the New Year and...
- To the new Toad!
Hello, you fellows!
Come! I'll show you the world.
Travel, change, excitement...
That was the fabulous
Thaddeus Toad.
But let's weigh our judgement carefully,
we Moles and Rats and Badgers.
Don't we envy him a bit?
I know I do.
When we speak of fabulous characters,
the most fabulous will always be, to me,
the master of Toad Hall.
Yes! J Thad was quite a lad!
Speaking of fabulous characters,
England has produced a bumper crop.
But here in the colonies, we have a few of our own.
Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill,
Johnny Appleseed, Black Bart,
Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone.
And, of course, the one and only Ichabod Crane.
Ichy was the country schoolmaster dreamed up by Washington Irving.
He had a way with a yarn did Mr Irving.
If we could journey back to that period in history
when Manhattan was but a market town,
we would discover, in one of the coves
which indent the shores of the Hudson,
the little village of Tarry Town.
And just beyond, nestled deep in the low rolling hills,
a sequestered glen.
It's a quiet, peaceful place,
and yet, somehow... foreboding.
It abounds in haunted spots,
twilight tales and local superstitions.
The best-known story concerns an itinerant schoolmaster
who once frequented these parts.
Some say his melancholy spirit still haunts the vicinity.
The pedagogue was described as a most unusual man.
To see him striding along,
one might mistake him for a scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.
He was tall, but exceedingly lank.
His head was small and flat on top, with a long, snipe nose.
It looked like a weathercock perched upon his spindle neck.
Altogether, he was an apparition seldom to be seen in broad daylight.
Late one drowsy autumn afternoon,
this strange figure first approached Sleepy Hollow.
As usual, there had gathered
at Ye Olde Schnooker and Schnapps Shoppe
a group of rustic lads, the Sleepy Hollow boys.
Their self-appointed leader, Brom Bones,
was a burly, roistering blade, always ready for a fight or a frolic.
Though Brom was given to madcap pranks and practical jokes,
there was no malice in his mischief.
With his waggish humour and prodigious strength,
Brom Bones was quite the hero, all the country round.
Odds bodkins! Gadzooks!
Look at that old spook of spooks.
Who's that coming down the street?
Are they shovels or are they feet?
Lean and lanky
Skin and bone
With clothes a scarecrow would hate to own
Yet, he has a certain air
Debonair and devil-may-care
It's the new schoolmaster
What's his name?
Ichabod
Ichabod Crane
What a name!
Kind of odd
But nice just the same
Funny pan, funny frame
Ichabod may be quaint
May be odd, and maybe he ain't
Anyway, there's no complaint
From Ichabod, Ichabod Crane...
Though the arrival of the pedagogue gave rise to mixed emotions,
the townspeople all agreed they'd never seen anyone...
Like Ichabod, Ichabod Crane
The schoolroom became
Ichabod's empire,
over which, with lordly dignity, he held absolute sway.
Truth to say, Ichabod was a conscientious man,
and ever bore in mind the maxim spare the rod and spoil the child.
Still, he was careful to administer justice
with discrimination.
For it behoved him to keep on good terms with his pupils.
Especially if their mothers happened to be good cooks.
Who's the town's ladies' man?
Gets around like nobody can
Has to be none other than...
As time went by, it may be seen that the pedagogue
got on tolerably enough.
Moreover, Ichabod found ways to increase his slender income
and, at the same time,
awaken the cultural interests of the sleepy little village.
It was inevitable that a man like Ichabod
would become an object of ridicule to Brom Bones and his gang.
Yet, to Ichabod, these were small matters.
He possessed a remarkable equanimity
which remained quite undisturbed until
that fateful day, when his path was crossed by a woman.
A certain woman.
Katrina Van Tassel, only child of Baltus Van Tassel,
the richest farmer in the county.
She was a blooming lass, plump as a partridge.
Ripe, melting and rosy-cheeked.
Once you have met that little coquette Katrina
You won't forget Katrina
But nobody yet has ever upset Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
You can do more with
Margaret or Helena
Or Anne or Angelina
But Katrina will kiss and run
To her, a romance is fun
With always another one to start
And yet when you've met that little coquette Katrina
You've lost your heart
There was no doubt the fair Katrina
was the richest prize in the countryside.
The schoolmaster, being an ambitious man,
began to fill his mind with many sugared thoughts
and hopeful suppositions.
Katrina, my love.
Who can resist your grace?
Your charm?
And who can resist your father's farm?
Boy, what a set-up!
There's gold in them acres, and that ain't hay.
Not to mention that lovely green stuff.
Katrina, my sweet. My treasure.
Treasure...
That barn's a gold mine.
How I'd love to hit the jackpot.
Dear Katrina. Papa's only child.
Papa!
The old goat can't take it with him.
When he cuts out, that's where I cut in.
Sweet Katrina, poor little rich girl.
But don't worry, Katie,
Ichabod will protect you.
Yes, Katrina, you've won me.
I surrender.
And yet when you've met that little coquette Katrina
You've lost your heart
Every portal to Katrina's heart was jealously guarded
by a host of rustic admirers.
But Ichabod was confident he'd soon ride roughshod
over these simple country bumpkins.
But the most formidable obstacle he had failed to reckon with.
That was the redoubtable
Brom Bones.
The ease with which Brom cleared the field of rivals
both piqued and provoked the fair Katrina.
She often wished that some champion would appear
and take the field openly against the boisterous Brom.
A wiser man would have shrunk from the competition,
but love is blind.
Ichabod was aware only that Dame Fortune
was at last thundering at his door.
It's true that Brom liked a joke as well as the next,
but enough was too much.
It was time for open warfare.
He'd double that schoolmaster up
and lay him on a shelf in his schoolhouse!
But this was easier said than done.
No doubt of it, this was
Ichabod's lucky day.
The schoolmaster was a man of hidden talents,
a rival to be reckoned with.
Still, wars are neither won nor lost at the first encounter.
The high-flyer might yet be brought to earth.
For Brom Bones was never a man to cry quits.
On the occasion of her father's annual Halloween frolic,
Katrina chose to stir the embers of the smouldering rivalry.
One invitation in particular carried a most personal summons.
The worthy schoolmaster was in a transport of joy.
To him, this could mean but one thing.
Ichy, you sly old dog, you!
What is this strange power you have over women?
Well, tonight's the night, boy!
Just turn on the old charm.
The fair Katrina is yours for the asking.
Gaily bedecked and nobly mounted on a horse he had borrowed,
Ichabod issued forth like a knight errant of old
to keep a tryst with his lady fair.
There was nothing to equal the merrymaking
at Mynheer Van Tassel's farm.
To Ichabod, here was a perfect field for his endeavours.
How would he put his best foot forward!
Beyond all his other talents, he prided himself upon his dancing.
Unhappy Brom, already bested at every turn,
saw himself once more outmatched.
For as he watched the posturing pedagogue,
he had to admit that here was a flawless picture
of ease and grace.
There was no doubt that Ichabod was the man of the hour.
Brom had to concede his rival another victory.
Yet, there was still a chance his time would come.
For when the hour grew late, Van
Tassel would call on his guests
to tell him ghostly tales of Halloween.
Brom knew there was no more potent believer
in spooks and goblins than Ichabod Crane.
Just gather round and I'll elucidate what goes on outside, when it gets late.
Around about midnight, the ghosts and banshees get together for nightly jamborees.
Things with horns and saucer eyes, and some with fangs about this size!
- Some are fat.
- And some are thin!
And some don't even wear their skin!
I'm telling you, brother, it's a frightful sight what goes on, Halloween night.
When spooks have a midnight jamboree
They break it up with fiendish glee
Ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed
Is the Headless Horseman, he's the worst
That's right, he's a fright on Halloween night
When he goes a-joggin' across the land
Holdin' his noggin in his hand
Demons take one look and groan
And hit the road for parts unknown
Beware, take care, he rides alone
And there's no spook like a spook who's spurned
They don't like him and he's really burned
He swears to the longest day he's dead
He'll show them that he can get ahead
They say he's tired of his flamin' top
He's got a yen to make a swap
So he rides one night each year
To find a head in the hollow here
Now, he likes them little, he likes them big
Part in the middle, or a wig
Black or white, or even red
The Headless Horseman needs a head
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out lookin' for a top to chop
So don't stop to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
Now, if you doubt this tale is so,
I met that spook just a year ago.
Now, I didn't stop for a second look, but made for the bridge that spans the brook.
For once you cross that bridge, my friends
The ghost is through, his power ends
So, when you're riding home tonight
Make for the bridge with all your might
He'll be down in the hollow there
He needs your head
Look out! Beware!
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out lookin' for a head to swap
So don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
It was the witching hour of night as Ichabod pursued his travel home.
The sky grew darker.
One by one, the stars winked out their lights.
Driving clouds obscured the moon from sight.
Never had the schoolmaster felt so melancholy,
so utterly alone.
The nearer he approached the hollow,
the more dismal he became.
Once inside the murky glen, Ichabod's anxiety increased one-hundredfold.
The forest seemed to close in behind him.
Every small detail of
Brom's awful story
returned to haunt his recollection.
Headless Horseman.
Beware!
Once you cross that bridge, my friends,
the ghost is through, his power ends.
Next morning, Ichabod's hat was found.
And close beside it, a shattered pumpkin.
But there was no trace of the schoolmaster.
Shortly thereafter, Brom Bones led the fair Katrina to the altar.
Rumours persisted that
Ichabod was still alive,
married to a wealthy widow in a distant county.
But the good Dutch settlers refused to believe such nonsense.
They knew the schoolmaster had been spirited away
by the Headless Horseman.
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out looking for a head to swap
But don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
Man, I'm getting out of here!
Fun, fun, fun

Da, da, dat
Da, da, dat, doit

That's the way I wanna be
I don't let my troubles trouble me

You'll see

You know, you worry too much.
In fact, everybody worries too much.
Here. Just look at the morning paper.
Turn to any page.
You'll find the whole world worryin'... about some future age.
But why get so excited?
What's gonna be is gonna be.
The end of the world's been comin' since 1903.
That's, uh, B.C., of course.
Don't cross a bridge or peek 'round the corner
Until you're there
Just learn to smile and in a while
You'll find trouble
You bet, you'll find trouble!
Oh! Aah! Ohh!
Take it easy, son.
Why, you're just a bundle of nerves.
You see? Jumpy as a cat!
Comes from always rushin' into things.
Hmm! Now what have I done?
I guess I don't know my own strength.
Sorry to upset you, miss.
Have you on your feet in a jiffy.
- Upsy-daisy.
- Mama!
Your mama isn't here, honey.
But if I can be of service, the name is Cricket.
Uh, J. Cricket. You can call me Jiminy.
Oops! Sorry! Ha-ha.
Oh. Howdy, chum.
Why so glum?
Say, what's the matter? You worried about somethin' too?
Tsk, tsk. Never saw such a dismal pair.
A deadpan doll and a droopy bear.
You ought to try my recipe.
Be full of fun and fancy-free.
Life is a song... happy, gay.
So let's have some music.
Come on! What d'you say?
"Bongo"? Now, what in the world is Bongo?
Oh! "A Musical Story
Sung by Dinah Shore."
Well, what are we waitin' for?
Da, da, doo, da
A ringer!
It's a gift.
Da, da, dee, da, la, doh
La, da
Take it away, Dinah!
This is the story...
- of three bears.
- Yeah, I know.
The mama bear, the papa bear, and the itsy-bitsy baby bear.
But it's not the story you expect.
This is a love story.
It's about a little girl bear... and a big, burly, brawny brown bear... who wanted very much to be her boyfriend.
But mostly, this is a story about Bongo.
He was a circus bear.
He was born in the circus, grew up in the circus.
In fact, Bongo was the star of the circus.
In fact, Bongo was the star of the circus.
Why, he could juggle and dance while on a trapeze, walk a tightrope with the greatest of ease.
In jujitsu, he was beyond compare.
Once threw a bull at the county fair.
Super at wrestling and lifting weights.
Outboxed the champs of 1 7 states.
They all packed in from near and far... to see this death-defying star.
With mouths wide open, they watched his ascent... as he daringly climbed to the top of the tent!
Then, for a grand climax, he would gracefully plunge 300 feet... into a wet sponge!
Poor Bongo.
Naturally, you'd think he'd be handled with kid gloves, treated like a king... and pampered like a baby.
But, no! He was tossed around like an old shoe.
Bongo, the bear in the gilded cage.
His thoughts would wander to an imaginary life... far removed from the circus.
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
Some half-forgotten instinct kept calling him.
For you see, Bongo was a dreamer.
Hey, Bongo! Get going! You're on!
The call of the wild kept ringing in his ears.
Psst! Hey. Bongo!
He couldn't ignore it any longer.
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
He had to answer the call of the great open spaces.
Come on out, Bongo.
Bongo, Bongo
Come on out, Bongo.
Come on out, Bongo!
Bongo, Bongo.
He was crackin' up!
Bongo, Bongo!
- He was losin' his grip!
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!
He had to escape, to get away!
Just gotta get away!
- Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta get away! Gotta get away.
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta, gotta, gotta!
Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!
At last he was free.
Free. Free?
Oh! But this was even better than he'd expected!
"Oh, boy, "thought
Bongo, "this is livin'!"
Whoo!
He felt so good, he just had to run around... and jump.
Why, he even tried to growl.
"Oh, boy! A tree. That's for me!"
Just right for climbin' too.
"Oh, well. What if I can't climb a big old tree?
This is still the place for a fellow like me."
- Ooh, ah, ohh
- Just lazy and loafin'... and fancy-free.
- I love to hang around
- Ooh
The lazy countryside
Where things are nice and breezy
With nature's gang around
The lazy countryside
Where life is twice as easy
Where the crickets
You don't hear in the city
Keep a-hummin' in your ear
Oh, so pretty
And it's just too much for words
Listenin' to the chorus of the birds
I like to stay around
The lazy countryside
And while away the hours
Just kind of play around
The lazy countryside
As free as bees and flowers
There's more fun in takin' the sun in
And to roam the spaces wide
It's the place for me
Gee, but it's great to be
'Round the lazy countryside
There's more fun in takin' the sun in
And to roam the spaces wide
It's the place for me
Gee, but it's great to be
'Round the lazy
Countryside
"Oh, boy," thought Bongo,
"this is the stuff."
"To stretch out under a canopy of stars...
"studding the velvet softness of the night.
To sleep in the peace and quiet of the woods."
The stillness of the night descends like a sheltering veil.
Hush. All nature sleeps.
Then came the dawn.
Ohh. Bongo felt as stiff as a board... and as cranky as an old bear.
Bongo was discouraged.
A fine kind of bear he'd turned out to be!
He didn't even know how to act like a bear.
This rough, rugged stuff wasn't for him.
Especially on an empty stomach.
Uh-uh.
Bongo thought, "This is just too good to be true!
"I... I'm either hungry or I'm still dreamin'.
"Ow! I'm awake! It must be true.
Oh, this is much better than dreamin'!"
"This must be heaven.
I-it can't be real!
"It's just too good to be true.
But let me go right on dreamin', as long as I'm with you."
This is too good
To be true
I can't believe it's real
Can it be you
I really see
I never knew
I'd find an angel
And out of the blue
You came to me
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Don't spread your wings
And fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
True
This is too good to be true
I can't believe it's real
Can it be you
I really see
I never knew I'd find an angel
Out of the blue you came to me
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Don't spread your wings
Don't fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
True
The air grew still with a sudden chill.
No talk, no laughs, no chatter.
With the trees shaking, the ground quaking, the crowd began to scatter.
Out of his lair came the third bear, with murder in his eye.
He took in the scene of love serene with jealousy and surprise.
He was the roughest, toughest, meanest bear.
Lump jaw by name, a villain for fair.
Well... what's this?
It's no dream. It's a nightmare!
"He-He-Hello," was all Bongo could say.
"Hmm. Kind of unfriendly.
Probably doesn't know who I am."
"Just a moment. This is my affair."
"He-He-Hello, Lulubelle, dear."
Gosh, Bongo was surprised.
Why should Lulubelle turn against him?
That was no way for a lady to act.
Lulubelle's feelings were hurt.
All right.
She'd give Mr. Bongo just one more chance.
"What have I done?"
Poor Bongo.
It was too good
- To be true
- Ah
Gone were his dreams.
His world was shattered.
Why hadn't someone ever told him about all of these things... that really mattered?
- And now,
- Ah well, now it was just too late.
He'd never find out that when bears are in love, they always say it with a slap.
When a bird loves a bird he can twitter
When a puppy falls in love he can yap
Every pigeon likes to coo when he says I love you
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
When a whippoorwill's in love he can whipper
All the horses neck and all the turtles snap
Every deer and every dove has a way of makin' love
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
You can ask any bear, Oh
There's nothin' to compare
With a love tap
Strong or weak
So if you're ready for romance and you ever get the chance
- Grab your girl
- Give her your cheek
- So when love comes along Don't be silly
- Doo, doo, doo, doo
- Never ever waste your time like a sap
- Doo, doo, doo, doo
Let the others hug and kiss but the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
- Slap, slap
- Give me a love tap
Grab your bears and swing 'em wide
Shake their fur and scratch their hide
Give her a slap
Give her a cuff
Go 'round that floor and strut your stuff
He slapped her once and he missed her jaw and he wound up smackin' his mother-in-law
Now here comes Grandpa gettin' in line, And here comes baby bear behind
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh
When a bird loves a bird he can twitter
When a puppy falls in love he can yap
Every pigeon likes to coo when he says I love you
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
When a whippoorwill's in love he can whipper
All of the horses neck and all the turtles snap
Every deer and every dove has a way of makin' love
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
You can ask any bear
Oh, there's nothing to compare with a love tap strong or weak
If you're ready for romance
And you ever get the chance
Grab your girl give her your cheek
So when love comes along don't be silly
Never ever waste your time like a sap
Let the others hug and kiss but the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
Slap, slap
So when love comes along don't be silly
Never ever waste your time like a sap
Let the others hug and kiss
But the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
"I love you, Lulubelle."
"I love you too, Bongo."
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Ohh don't spread your wings
And fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Ooh
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
- True
- Is it only a dream
Too good to be true
Excuse me. There.
Now who says dreams don't come true? Well!
Three is a crowd, they say.
So I'll drop back another day.
" Miss Luana Patten."
Mmm! Well.
Of course, it's not cricket to read other folks' mail, but...
"A party!
Tonight!" Mmm.
"The house across the way.
"Charlie McCarthy. Mortimer Snerd!
Edgar Bergen?" Huh.
Never heard of him.
"Please come!"
Why, I'd be delighted!
Join the party
Come along
It's a cinch
Can't go wrong
Now's the time to see what you can see
The house is just across the way
Better hurry
Don't delay
You'll be full of fun and fancy-free
Oh, dear. Nanny goats and petticoats.
- I'm a caution.
- Yes, you certainly are.
Tell me, what is the secret of your lovely complexion?
- Well, I... I use saddle soap.
- I see.
Yes. If I'm not being too personal, Ophelia...
- Yeah?
- Uh, how old are you?
- Oh, I'm, uh, a girl my age.
- A girl your age?
- Yes.
- And how old is that?
- Uh, 28.
- Twenty-eight.
I thought you were a little bit older than that.
Well, I knocked off a few years for good behavior.
I don't care for that.
It's kid stuff. Ha-ha.
Well, we're awfully glad you came to our party.
- Well.
- Did you have fun?
Oh, yes, indeedy. I thought Charlie made a pig of himself with that chocolate cake.
- Oh, you're quite right.
- Yes, I am. Yes.
Yes, I agree with you.
- Well, good night, Luana.
- Good night, Ophelia.
- Bonne nuit, Mortimer.
- Uh... ma'am?
- Bonne nuit.
- Oh, yes, ma'am. Yeah, yeah. Bunny...
Uh, bunny, bunny wee, bunny wee. Bun...
Uh... uh, I don't know no bunny wee.
- Good night, Charlie.
- Uh, good night.
- You know, Ophelia, you look so sweet.
- Ah, what'd you say?
- I say, I think you look so sweet.
- Yes?
- I'm going to kiss you good night.
- Oh, help, help, help!
Help, he...
Isn't that a wonderful trick?
Yes, it is. Yes. I wish I could enjoy my first childhood... as much as he does his second.
Now, Luana, how would you like another piece of cake or some ice cream?
- No, thank you. I'm full up.
- Some candy?
- Care for a cigar?
- Me?
How about you, Mortimer?
- Mortimer?
- Uh... I don't smoke.
I don't mean that. Well, what shall we do now? Any suggestions?
How would you like to go down to the city dump and watch me slug rats?
- Certainly not.
- No?
How would you like to hear me tell a story?
Oh, I'd love it.
Wouldn't you, Charlie?
Well, I, uh... y-y-yeah... no.
This is a story that everyone should know.
Yes, but not everyone should tell it. And you know who.
Well, I'm going to tell it anyway.
Now, many, many years ago...
I think I'll run out and wind a sundial.
- You'll stay right here.
- Yes, sir.
Once upon a time, long, long ago...
Funny, nothing ever happens nowadays.
There was a place called Happy Valley.
Now, it was called Happy Valley... because everyone who lived there was happy.
- No! Well, there's a hunk of logic for you.
- Are you listening, Mortimer?
- Uh, Happy Valley?
- That's right, yes.
Now just try and imagine it. Can't you just close your eyes and see it?
Well, I can't see very good with my eyes closed.
My eyelids get in the way.
- You create a picture in your mind's eye.
- Oh.
That's not easy for him.
His mind gets in the way.
- Now try and paint a mental picture.
- Yeah.
I... I painted a barn once, I did.
- Well, that's very interesting.
- Yeah.
- It was... It was a red barn. It was. Yeah.
- Well, forget the barn.
- Yeah.
- And try and picture Happy Valley.
- Well, I'll... I'll work on it.
- That's the spirit.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll work on it.
Let's see, uh... Let's see, now.
It's, uh... Oh, let's say it's about, uh...
Uh, what was the question?
- Happy Valley.
- Oh, yeah! Yeah. That's right. Yeah.
- Let's see, uh...
- Think hard!
Yeah.
Let's see, uh...
Oh, I'm tired. All that work for nothin'.
- Can I try?
- Certainly.
Yes. I think I can see it, Mr. Bergen.
It's beautiful.
Yes, it was one of nature's garden spots, nestled among the green, rolling hills.
Can't you see the lovely brook as it flows through the valley?
Mmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The winding roads, lined with stately trees.
Trees. Yeah.
Lush fields and prosperous farms dot the landscape.
L-Landscape. Yeah.
And high on a hilltop overlooking the valley,
- shining like a jewel, stands...
- My red barn.
No, no. It was something much nicer.
- It was a majestic castle!
- Oh, that's pretty.
And something very precious is kept within these castle walls.
- My
- What is it?
It's a magic, singing harp. Listen.
What a happy day
What a sunny sky, kind of makes you sigh in a happy way
What a very merry day
All the world is gay
When your cares are light and your heart takes flight
And you're swept away
The air is sweet with clover
The clouds are turning over
Oh, yes
They're turning over
Just to show their silver lining
My, what a happy day
Never knew such bliss
Never read of this
In a book or play
What a lovely day
What a great big gorgeous, sumptuous thumping, bumptious
Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious
My, what a happy day
M-M-My, what a happy day
Never knew such bliss
Never read of this in a book or play
What a lovely day
What a great big gorgeous, sumptuous thumping, bumptious
Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious
Oh, my, oh, my
What a happy
Day
Yes, the voice of this golden harp... cast a magic spell of joy and prosperity over the valley.
- But it was too good to last...
- I knew there was a catch in it.
- for one day...
- They built a schoolhouse.
No, no. One day a mysterious shadow crept over the valley.
And then something dreadful happened!
Aaaaaah!
What happened?
When the shadow lifted, the golden harp was gone.
No longer was the valley happy, for without the magic of the harp, all was misery, misery, misery.
Just like the eighth grade.
Desolation spread over the land.
Everything was drying up.
- Dry rot.
- Yes, isn't it?
- Charlie.
- Yes, sir.
The fields of golden corn turned to dust.
Kerplop.
The laughing brook flowed no more.
To think that this was once Happy Valley!
Now it's Gruesome Gulch.
Days pass, weeks pass.
I pass. New deal.
What happened to all the people?
Well, suppose we look in on these humble peasants.
- Is that a peasant?
- That's a cow, stupid.
Well, at least they had milk.
Well, she used to be a good milker. But now...
She's an udder failure.
She was the bosom friend of a once-proud family.
Well, they're certainly out of the high rent district.
And there they are, three poor farmers, gripped by the pangs of starvation.
Still alive, still breathing, sharing a pitiful crust between them.
Share and share alike.
Sharing and staring.
Staring and sharing.
Uh, just tell it, don't ham it.
But are their spirits broken?
Have they lost hope?
Yes. Men facing famine, naught left but beans.
Ahem. Bean, you mean.
If it were one man and three beans...
But, no. One bean and three men.
Well, at least there are no bones in it.
Just look at that miserable creature, doggedly struggling to maintain life, a gaunt, lean bag of bones and feathers.
Truly a picture of despair.
But Donald doesn't whimper.
- Donald doesn't give up.
- Shut up!
I can't stand it!
Easy, Donald. Easy!
There. There, now.
There. Easy, Donald.
I... I'll be all right.
Yeah. I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.
He says he's all right, but I wonder.
He's suffered too much.
What diabolical thought is being hatched in the fevered brain... of this poor, demented duck?
Donald! No! No!
Nice bossy, bossy.
- Nice old cowsy wowsy.
- Donald!
Donald! No, Donald!
Give it here! Let me...
I just gotta eat.
I'm so... hungry.
The little fellow was completely out of his head.
- Cut it out, will ya? I get the idea!
- He was a pitiful sight.
- Weeks without food. Poor Donald.
- Yeah, poor me!
It was all they could do to restrain him.
You see, he had just about reached...
- the end of his rope.
- Yeah.
Oh, it was a sorry predicament indeed.
What to do? What to do?
Well, Donald may be nuts, but he's got the right idea. Kill the cow.
Oh, no, Charlie! The cow was their best friend.
Well, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
- So what?
- So, they need some steak.
No! If you're gonna kill the cow,
I don't wanna hear the rest of the story.
Well, she wouldn't have to know.
They could sneak up on her and surprise her. Yeah, that's what we'll do.
- We'll kill the cow.
- Oh, no, Charlie. You mustn't.
We'll get a stranglehold on her while she's asleep.
- a-a-and then push her off the cliff.
- Oh, no!
I ain't a-gonna listen to the story.
Well, it'll be your fault if they starve to death.
- Why don't they sell the cow?
- That's just what they did.
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place, and save a lot of time?
I could save a lot of time by not telling the story at all!
Your idea is not without merit.
Well, back to the scene of desolation.
Things are beginning to look much brighter now, because as Mickey goes to the village to sell the cow, the thought of prosperity... brings new hope to the famished farmers.
Even Donald has fully recovered, for soon their long-empty plates... will overflow with food.
Hey, look! Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie
Pancakes piled up 'til they reach the sky
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa
Oh-h-h-h
I wanna eat and eat and eat and eat
And eat until I die
Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie
Pancakes piled up 'til they reach the sky
Lots of starches
Lots of greens
Fancy chocolate-covered...
- Beans!
- What d'you mean, beans?
Yeah, fellows. I sold the cow for some magic beans!
Beans!
But Donald!
These are not ordinary beans!
They're magic beans!
If you plant these beans in the light of a full moon, do you know what'll happen?
Yes! We get more beans!
- No, no, Donald!
- Magic beans! Phooey!
Poor Mickey, cheated into trading his cow for a handful of beans.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a mean trick!
Swindling an innocent farmer out of all he owned... and lying to him, telling him that the beans were magic.
Planted in the light of a full moon!
What a shame to deceive a simple little peasant.
Magic beans, indeed!
- Light of a full moon.
- Bergen? Oh, Bergen!
- What?
- There's something moving.
Why, yes. Well, maybe there is some magic in them!
All right, now let's all keep quiet and see what happens.
Mmm.
And all through the night, it grew, onward and upward.
That thing is a menace to aviation.
And so, with the coming of dawn, we find the bewildered farmers staring at a mammoth castle, miles above the earth.
Their curiosity was aroused, nothing could hold them back.
Who lives there? Man or monster?
Friend or foe?
A princess or a dragon?
Well, search me.
What drew them toward this place of mystery?
Hunger? Desperation?
Or perhaps it was love of adventure.
What a fantastic experience, perhaps mortal man... has never before set foot on this strange land.
- Well, somebody did.
- Oh, gosh! Who made them?
Well, it wasn't Cinderella.
Soon they reached the moat surrounding the castle.
But this didn't stop them. On they went, as if drawn by some irresistible force.
And then, suddenly, without warning, out of the sky above...
Ooh, dragonflies!
Yeah. A-flyin' front and draggin' behind.
- Gee, what whoppers!
- Yeah. Bombers!
Come back and fight!
Finally, they reached the castle.
The hard way.
This was the biggest adventure of their lives.
Forgotten was their hunger, forgotten was their fear.
It took courage to scale these massive steps, to make this journey into the unknown.
But these stouthearted lads never faltered.
Three minds with but a single thought.:
What mystery lurked within those cold, forbidding walls?
What strange spell hovered over this gloomy place?
Will no one answer?
Are they walking into a trap?
Do they go in?
You know, you could stand some rehearsal on this story.
Inside, the tremendous hall was as silent as a tomb.
Not a sign of life anywhere.
Caught with his pants...
- Charlie!
- Caught with his pants...
- Charlie!
- Well, his slip was showing.
They gazed in speechless wonder, almost afraid to breathe.
Suddenly they looked up.
What was it?
Food! Yum, yum, yum, yum!
Let me at it!
Oh! Who's there? Who is it?
- That's the harp!
- Boy, oh, boy!
How'd you get here?
I was kidnapped by that wicked giant!
- Oh. A... A giant!
- A giant!
- A giant?
- A giant!
- Bigger than 40 men.
- Oh, no!
An ogre who had the power to turn himself into anything, man or beast.
That calls for a drink.
It was this heartless monster that swooped down under cover of darkness, carried off the golden harp and...
- brought ruin to Happy Valley.
- No!
Ohh!
Ohh!
- I'm a giant.
- You are not.
- You're nothing of the kind.
- Well, I'm a small giant.
- No, you're not.
- I'm, uh... I'm tougher than 40 men.
- You're not.
- Well... uh, 20 men.
- No.
- No? Ten men?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
Charlie? Why do you act like that?
I don't know. I guess it's just a stage I'm goin' through.
- Well, take off that moustache.
- Yeow!
Now go over there and behave yourself.
Yes, sir. Everything I do is wrong.
But why did the giant want to steal the harp?
Because he was cruel and selfish. He didn't care what happened to the valley.
He just wanted someone to sing him to sleep.
Well, why didn't he turn on the radio?
Well, they didn't have radios in those days.
Yeah. That's why they called it Happy Valley.
- What did the giant look like?
- Well, he was...
Oh... I'll try and show you.
He looked something like this.
Ha. Looks like my pig Smedley.
Never mind the self-portraits. Ha-ha.
Well, no, that isn't right.
He... He looked more like... more like this.
There he is now. And the giant came home for dinner, roaring...
- Drunk.
- I was not!
- I mean, he was not.
- No.
Down the castle hall he came, roaring...
Fe, fi, fo, fum!
Fe, fi, fo, fum!
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm a most amazing guy
A most amazing guy am I
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm the stuff, I'm tellin' you for here's what I can do
I can change myself into an elf
Fly up high like the birdies
I can disappear into atmosphere
Peekaboo. 'Cause I know the magic wordies
Fi, fo, fe, foy
Fe, fe, fe, fe
Fifi? I don't know no Fifi.
Those are his magic words, you know.
Fe, fi, fo, fum.
- I smell...
- You're telling us!
Wait. He may be smarter than he looks.
Oh, I hope he doesn't find them.
Hey, Giant, you're getting warm.
Well, don't tell him!
- Behind the jar, stupid.
- Charlie!
Pot roast! Chocolate pot roast!
With stispacio...
With dismashmee...
With dismash...
With green gravy.
Feedy, fidey, fodey, fum!
Gesundheit.
Oh, no, you don't! You can't get away from Willie.
I gotcha!
I think I gotcha.
Yeah, I gotcha.
Willie.
What?
He'll have to talk fast to get out of this one.
Well, you leave it to Mickey. Just watch.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty.
Boy, what a life line!
But what's this here?
What is it? What is it!
Uh-oh! I can't believe it!
- Is it bad?
- Why, i-it says here... that you can change yourself into anything!
Sure, sure! You wanna see me?
I can change myself into the darndest things!
Go on, gimme somethin'.
- Anything!
- Anything?
Anything.
See? Mickey never misses a trick.
- He's got a good idea.
- Well, uh...
Can you change into a fly?
A cute, teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy housefly?
That's it. A housefly.
Aw, you don't want a fly.
How about a bunny with long, pink ears?
Ha. Well, of course, if you can't do a fly, why, uh...
All right. A fly.
- Why?
- Well, they're, uh...
- Because.
- Okay.
A teeny-weeny fly.
With pink wings.
Now for the magic wordies.
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm a most amazing guy
Te, ti, te, ti, te, ti
You sure you don't want a pink bunny?
Hey, what is this?
You think you fool Willie.
Yeah, a couple more good ideas like that and they're finished.
Well, I'll admit the little fellows are in a bad fix.
But Mickey isn't one to give up without a struggle.
And with a little luck, they may still pull through.
This isn't the first time
Mickey's been in a tight spot.
Anybody wanna buy a tall, thin mouse?
No, thank you. Uh, I mean no.
Yes, things look pretty dark for the prisoners.
Looks like their goose is cooked.
Oh, Fate may yet deal them a winning hand.
Don't forget, there's still the magic harp. She knows the giant's weakness.
She could be my weakness.
There might still be a chance of escape... if she could only use her magic voice to put the giant to sleep.
If she can't, I know who can.
Shh. Let's all be quiet now, and see.
In my favorite dream
Everyone is so delightful
No one's mean or spiteful
In my favorite dream
Yes, and in my favorite dream
There my heart can go romancing
Dancing to a heavenly theme
But there's something else
I look forward to
It's a secret
But here's a clue
He's my favorite
You know who
You're the hero of
My most favorite
Dream
Oh, mercy. Forgive us.
In his right vest pocket
You'll find the key
The right vest pocket
Go carefully
Oh!
Ah... Ah... Ah...
I'll smash... Ah... I'll smash...
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Where is he?
Hello?
Nightmare.
Oh, boy.
- He made it!
- He did?
- Here he comes with the key!
- Let me have it, Mickey!
Well, it looks like success at last.
Free from the clutches of that terrible monster.
And now to find the beanstalk, climb down and return home in triumph, with a big surprise for Happy Valley.
But wait. Mickey's going to make doubly sure.
He's taking no chances.
Just in case the giant might wake up.
Oh!
Ha. Should have left well enough alone.
Come back here! Come back here!
And there goes the giant!
He's helpless now, tumbling over and over and over, down, down, down, down.
And so with the passing of the wicked giant,
Happy Valley echoed once again with song and laughter.
For with the return of the magic harp, peace and prosperity reigned throughout the land.
- And the people of the valley...
- We know.
Lived happily ever after.
You're a wonderful storyteller,
Mr. Bergen. Isn't he, Charlie?
Simply thrilling.
You're even better than the old-fashioned sleeping pill.
What's the matter, Mortimer?
Oh, the poor giant got killed, that he did.
- I don't like them sad endings.
- Oh, now, you don't understand.
W-Willie was a nice giant, he was.
He just got too big for his britches.
- But you don't understand.
- No, don't touch me.
I'll be all right.
Oh, excuse me.
What I'm trying to explain,
Mortimer, is that Willie the Giant...
- didn't actually exist.
- No?
No. He's a metaphysical phenomenon of your subconscious mind, a phantasmagoria of your mental faculties.
Yeah?
In other words, just a figment of your imagination.
- No!
- Yes.
So there's nothing to be upset about.
Hey! Has anybody seen anything... of a teensy-weensy little mouse?
No. I-I-I, uh...
Oh, Mr. Bergen!
Bergen, speak to me. Speak to me.
What's the matter with him?
Somethin' he ate?
Uh, no. It's, uh...
It's a fig, uh, fig... fig-a-mentation of his imagination.
- No!
- Yeah.
Well, uh, good night, Willie.
Uh, don't slam the roof.
You might wake Mr. Bergen.
Now some folks don't believe in giants
Castles up above
And others say that bears don't talk
And never fall in love
If you really wanna find
Happiness
Peace of mind
Believe in all your dreams
And you will see
You'll be full of fun and fancy
Free and full of fun
And fancy-free
Maa-ax!
Roxanne?
What's wrong?
- Agh! No!
- Look!
Uh... Ahh!
Hello?
- Ahem. Hello.
- Max, where the heck are you, man?
- P.J.?
- You should've been here an hour ago.
What? What are...
Hold on. Oh, no!
Look, maybe we should just call the whole thing off.
No way, man.
It's now or never.
You better get a move on.
I'll meet you at my locker.
Ayuk!
Mornin', son!
Dad!
Oops!
I forgot.
Ayuk! Mornin', son!
Came to see if you had any... dirty clothes.
Well, there they are.
Help yourself.
Max, I thought we talked about this.
Look, I'm sorry, Dad.
I- I'll take care of it later. Ow!
- What's the big rush?
- I'm running late.
- Ooh. I could drive ya on my way to work.
- Uh, no. No, thanks.
- I, uh, need the exercise.
- Aw, come on, Max. Huh?
Dad!
No, don't do it!
Don't...
No!
Oh, Dad, you ruined it.
Sorry 'bout that.
Who was he, anyway?
It's only Powerline, Dad.
The biggest rock star on the planet.
Ooh, not bigger than
Xavier Cugat, the Mambo King.
Everybody mambo!
# Boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom #
- Dad, there's no time for this.
What if the neighbours see us?

- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.
I just, uh...
I can't believe
I did that!
Ah! She finally says
"hi" to me, and what do I do?
I... choke!
- Like a big spaz!
- Where have you been, buddy?
Ah. Hi, Peej.
Did you get the camera?
Look, Max, if my dad catches me with this, he'll kill me!
Are you sure we gotta do this?
It's my only chance, Peej.
To Roxanne, I'm...
I'm just a nobody.
But after today...
Bobby!
Wow, look!
All this is for us?
Mmm, slurpage!
Oh, this is gonna be so great, man!
Dah.
Need fund-age, bro.
Oh, your fee.
Yeah, yeah. Right here.
Cheddar!
Cheddar whizzy!
It's pretty scrumptious.
Let's do it, ladies!
As student body president,
I just wanna say like "yea"...
- to all of us for a really neat year.
- Yo, Stacey!
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby!
And also that I hope you can all attend my totally amazing end-of-school party... next Saturday to watch the Powerline concert live on pay-per-view.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
And now, without further ado,
Principal Mazur.
Thank you, Stacey.
And good morning, boys and girls.
You know, every year on the last day of school...
I have several youngsters approach me and say,
"Principal Mazur, what can we do to not waste our summer vacation?
- We don't want to waste our free time...
Sleeping or visiting friends."
Say, Roxanne, about Stacey's party.
How you, uh...
How you doin' down there, Bobby?
Don't give me that attitude, you guys.
I'm doin' it all for you.
This is nuts. I don't know why
I let you guys talk me into this.
If my dad finds out, he's gonna nuke my entire existence.
...of the element, or...
I hope this works.
How about science slumber parties? Wha...
Wha...
Hey!
I'm not gonna just...
# Some people settle for the typical things #
# Livin' all their lives waitin' in the wings #
# It ain't a question of "if"
It's a matter of time #
# Before I move to the front of the line #
# Once you're watchin' every move that I make #
# You gotta believe that I got what it takes #
# To stand out above the crowd #
# Even if I've gotta shout out loud #
# 'Til mine is the only face you'll see #
# Gonna stand out
'til you notice me, yeah #
A little smoke-ege!
Oou-ou-ou!
# If I can make you stop and take a look at me instead of just #
# Walkin' by #
# There's nothin' that I wouldn't do if it was gettin' you to notice #
# I'm alive #
# All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance #
# To prove I've got whatever it takes #
It's a piece of cake.
# To stand out above the crowd #
Wow! Who's that guy?
# 'Til mine is the only face you'll see #
# Gonna stand out... #
Hey, it's the Goof boy!
We're busted!
Ayuk!
Come on, smile!
Smiley-wiley!
Oh, come on, Kimmie.
Gimme a big...
Stop goofin' around!
We got work to do!
Okay, Kimmie, back to Mommy now.
You're such a cute little girlie.
Oh, come back and see me.
Oh, you have such a way with children.
"You have such a way with children"!
Okay, now.
Who's next over here?
Step aside, Goof.
Let a pro show you how it's done.
Okay. Who's next over here?
Ooh, hello, precious...
You lucky woman.
Now, now, you come on here, honey.
- It's picture time. Come on.
- Peekaboo!
- She's so cute.
- Peekaboo!
Gosh, Pete, you sure are good with kids.
Oh, yeah. Well, they love me.
Ha-ha. Why P.J., he's been beggin' me to take him on vacation this summer.
Really?
Where ya goin'?
Campin'! Nothing like the great outdoors... to strengthen the bond between a father and a son.
Oh, Max'd never go for anything like that.
- Gimme, gimme.
- I don't know, Goof.
Somethin's wrong when a kid won't spend time with his parents.
Well, for all you know, he's runnin' around with some gang,
- and stealin' stuff, and causin' riots and...
- Whaaa! Gimme!
Oh, Max is a good kid.
He'd never get mixed up in somethin' like that.
I'm a failure. Complete loser.
My one chance to impress Roxanne, and I blew it.
Uh-huh!
Max, look.
It's the Leaning Tower of Cheese-a. Huh.
Oh, man! My dad is gonna smash me like a bug.
Hey, P.J., detention!
Ha-ha-ha!
Robert Zimuruski.
Okay. I'm comin'.
Max, here.
Guard this with your life, dude.
Hey, Maz-u-ur!
What's up, bro?
All right.
Then my parents' air conditioner went on the fritz.
I figured with all those kids in my house, the place would be like a sauna. So I freaked out.
Then I thought, like, use it.
So my theme's gonna be,
"Powerline Goes
Rain Forest."
Too much?
Roxanne, are you listening?
Oh!
- Stacey, no! I don't wanna...
- Talk to him.
A- Ahem!
A- A-Ahem!
Hmm.
Tap him.
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay... really.
Um, I liked your dance.
Yeah. Yeah?
Yeah, it's from
Powerline's new video.
I know. H-He's totally a genius.
Yeah. H-He's doing a concert next week in L.A.
Oh, yeah.
Stacey's showing it at her party.
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
Um, uh,
Roxanne,
I was, uh, sorta, kinda thinkin' that maybe I'd, um, ask you to, uh, go with me, that is to the... party.
Of course if you don't want to,
I'd completely understand.
Well, I was sorta, kind of thinkin' that... I'd love to.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Great.
- Terrific.
- Wonderful.
- All right.
- Okay.
Come on, Roxanne. We don't want to belabor the moment now, do we?
Well, I'd better be going.
I'll, uh, call you later.
Okay.
Bye. Oh.
Bye.
See, that wasn't so bad.
I told you men were easy to deal with.
Yes!
She said yes!
Ya-ha-ha-hoo!
Everybody mambo!
# Rum-bum-bum-bum-dah #
Yeah! Dance with her!
Groove with her.
- Miss Maple!
- Yes, sir?
Get that boy's father on the phone at once!
Right away, sir!
Whoo!
Hello.
Ah, yes. Mr Goof, this is Principal Mazur.
I'm calling in regard to your son Maximilian.
Max? Oh, my gosh!
Is he hurt?
No, Mr Goof.
He's in trouble!
Trouble?
What kind of trouble?
- Dressed like a gang member.
- Gang member?
Your son caused the entire student body... to break into a riotous frenzy!
- Riot? Couldn't be my...
- If I were you, Mr Goof,
I'd seriously reevaluate the way you're raising your child... before he ends up in the electric chair!
The electric chair?
What am I gonna do?
Blue light special on aisle three.
Blue light special on aisle three.
Lake Destiny.
Okay, kiddo.
Now, smile!
Lake Destiny, Idaho!
- Lake who-did-ho?
- You were right, Pete.
Nothin' like the great outdoors to strengthen the bond between father and son.
- You said so yourself.
- Well, yeah, but...
I'm goin' fishin'!
I'm goin' fishin' with my boy!
Yeah. Okay, precious.
Gimme a big smi...
Fishing! Fishing!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Cool concert, lad.
- What?
- You wailed, bud!
- Hey, Max, wicked dance.
- Thanks.
Forget it, girl.
He's Roxanne's.
Way to go, man!
I just heard about you and Roxanne.
Oh, Pete!
Ow!
See, see? I told you our plan would work!
- Max! Max! Max!
- Peej, knock it off. Come on. Shh.
- Maximum! Maxi-mu-um!
- Max! Max!
Max! Max!
Max! Max! Max!
Max! Max! Max!
Yea!
# All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance #
# To prove I've got whatever it takes #

# Stand out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #
# Stand out #
# 'Til mine is the only face you'll see #
# Gonna stand out ##
'Til you notice me.
Goin' somewhere, Pop?
- Sure are, pal-a-roony.
- Cool. Have a good time, Dad.
If you're gonna be gone more than a month, drop me a line.
But, Max, this isn't just my vacation.
It's a vacation with me and my best buddy.
- Oh, Donald Duck?
- No, silly. With you!
Are you okay, Maxie?
Wh-What did you say?
That's right!
A vacation, son!
We'll spend some real quality time together!
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Hey, got a present for ya!
Dad, stop that!
What are you doing?
You look just like I did at your age.
Please don't say that,
Dad.
Wait! I saved the best for last.
It's been handed down from Goof to Goof to Goof.
And now, it's yours, son.
- A stick?
- No, silly.
A fishin' pole!
Fishing?
We're going fishing?
Yep. Just like my dad and me did.
Two best buddies fishin' on Lake Destiny.
Away from it all!
I don't wanna be
"away" from it all, Dad.
I like "it all"!
Look, Maxie, we're using the same map me and my dad used.
We'll take the same route, and make the same stops... and see the same sights.
- But that trip would take weeks, Dad!
- Exactly!
- Gettin' there is half the fun.
- Put the map away, Dad.
- It's not gonna happen. I'm tellin' ya...
- Be careful, son.
You'll wrinkle my past.
Ayuk! And our future.
What the map says, Max, we will follow.
That's very mystical and everything, Dad, but, uh, seriously, there's this party
I have to go to, see?
- And there's this girl...
- Oh, there'll be plenty of time for parties when you're older.
Why, when I was your age
I'd never even been invited to a party.
- Look at me now!
- Great, Dad.
- Hop in, Maxie.
- No!
All right, then.
Guess I'll just have to go... all alone.
That's all.
Just sit in the boat... all alone... and talk to myself.
- All alone.
- I guess so.
- Oh, come on! Hop in!
- No, Dad.
- Just hop right in there.
- No.
- Come on, Maxie. Go for it!
- Agh! No.
Let's buckle you up!
And we're ready for takeoff!
Set for adventure,
Maxie?
Why are you doing this to me, Dad?
'Cause I don't want ya to end up in the electric chair.
Electric chair?
What are you...
I'm not givin' up on ya, son.
Together, we're gonna work this out.
Work this out?
But, Dad!
No buts about it,
Maxie boy.
- Your ol' pop knows best.
- But...
Goodbye, house.
Goodbye, mailbox.
Goodbye, pile of broken wood.
Goodbye, hopes.
Goodbye, dreams.
Goodbye, Roxanne.
Roxanne!
Dad, I gotta stop somewhere first.
I have to talk to someone.
- Well...
- Turn here!
D- Dad, watch out!
Stop here.
Here! Pull over!
Now, make it quick, Maxie boy.
We gotta put some road behind us.
You get and cancel your first date in less than an hour.
Must be some kind of lame-o record.
Grrr.
Hi. Is Roxanne home?
Grrr.
M-M-My name's Max.
Does Roxanne live here?
- Does she even live on this block? Ha-ha.
- Wait!
It's okay, Daddy.
Max is a friend from school.
Go on. Go on.
Good Daddy.
- Hey, Max.
- Hi, there.
You wanna... uh, have a seat?
Hey. Uh, u-u-oh.
- Grrr.
- Daddy!
I promise, he'll be better behaved when you pick me up for the party.
Yeah, that's, uh, sorta why I came by.
I'm really looking forward to it, Max.
- Yeah. I was too.
- Was?
You see, my dad's on this stupid father-son kick and...
Don't worry about it, Max.
It's just a dumb party.
No, it's not. Roxanne,
I really wanted to go with you.
- No, Max, I understand.
Really, it's okay.
- But my dad surprised me.
- These things happen.
- I don't wanna go, but I have no choice.
- I'm sure I can find someone else.
- Someone else?
- I'll just talk to you later.
- Uh, uh, Roxanne!
Uh, my dad is, uh...
My dad's taking me to the Powerline concert in L.A.
Your dad's taking you clear across the country just to see a concert?
Uh, well, you see, uh, my dad... uh, knew... knows, knows Powerline.
They used to play together in a band!
- Yeah!
- Come on, son!
Let's get this show on the road!
Uh, ha!
Just a minute!
You... party animal, you.
- You're really serious.
- Absolutely.
So, uh, you aren't still thinkin' of goin' with someone else, are you?
- Well, I guess...
- Because I was hopin'...
I could, uh, wave to you onstage... when we join Powerline for the final number.
This is incredible.
Well, I wouldn't miss our date for anything that wasn't incredible, Roxanne.
Have a great time at the concert, Max.
I'll see you on TV!
Ah. I'm in deep sludge.
Day one.
Well, here we are, out on the open road, retracin' the steps of my boyhood.
And here's Maxie!
Say hi, Max.
- Well, how 'bout a wave?
- Not now, Dad.
Ayuk! What a kidder!
Fun games I used to play with my dad.
Road bingo. Twenty ques...
Aah! Hey, Maxie.
Let's play a game.
You think of a name, and I'll try and guess who it is.
- Uh, man or woman?
- Oh, man.
A man, huh?
Hmm, that's a toughie.
Uh, let's see.
- Walt Disney!
- Right.
I'm good at this.
Now, uh, I'll think of one.
Hmm.
Oh! You wanna sing a song, huh?
Me and my dad used to sing this one all the time.
# High hopes #
# He's got high hopes #
# He's got high apple pie #
# In the sky hopes #
# Oops, there goes another... #
# Oops, there goes... #
# Oops, there goes... #
# Oops... #
Oh, g-great, Dad.
Now we don't have any music!
Oh, Maxie.
It's not so bad.
We'll just have to entertain ourselves!
Putt-putt-poof!
Putt-putt-poof!
- Ping-ping-ping.
- Putt-putt-poof!
Ping-ping-ping. Ping-ping-ping.
- Ping-ping-ping.

# Do ya need a break from modern livin' #
# Do you long to shed your weary load #
# If your nerves are raw and your brain is fried #
# Just grab a friend and take a ride together #
# On the open road #
Come on, Maxie!
# All in all
I'd rather have detention #
# All in all
I'd rather eat a toad #
Yuck!
# Old man drives like such a klutz #
# That I'm about to hurl my guts directly #
# Upon the open road #
# There's nothin' can upset me
'cause now we're on our way #
# Our trusty map will guide us straight and true #
# Roxanne, please don't forget me
I will return someday #
# Though I may be in traction when I do #
- # Me and Max relaxin' like the old days #
- # This is worse #
- # Than dragon breath and acne #
- # In a buddy-buddy kind of way #
# I'm so mad I think
I may explode #
- # When I see that highway I could cry #
- # That's funny, so could I #
# Just bein' out on the open road #
# Howdy, boys
Is this the way to Nashville #
Watch it, Mac!
# Or you'll be gettin' towed #
# I'm in no hurry to arrive #
# 'Cause I'll be turnin' sixty-five #
# The next time I sees the open road #
- # Just a week of rest and relaxation #
- Yeah!
# And the odd romantic episode #
Very odd!
# And it's Califor-ni-a or bust #
# Look out, you dirtbags
Eat my dust #
# From now on
I own the open road #
# It's me and little Maxie
My pip-squeak pioneer #
# They're partners forever
Westward ho #
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!
# Could someone call a taxi and get me outta here #
# To Beverly Hills
# Oh, every day another new adventure #
# Every mile another new zip code #
# And the cares we had are gone for good #
# And I'd go with them if I could #
# I got no strings on me
I'm feelin' fancy free #
# How wonderful to be #
# On the open road #
# Ro-oad ##
# You'll all do-do-do-do #
# Do-do-do Bum-bum-bum #
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Dad, you're gonna get us killed!
- Why don't you just give me the map?
- Oh, no thanks, son.
Navigating's a big responsibility.
Besides, you wouldn't wanna spoil the big surprise!
I'm takin' you someplace pretty special.
Gosh! It's even better than I remembered.
No, Mommy! I don't wanna go!
Yeah, fun.
Tell you what.
- I'm just gonna wait right here in the car.
You party pooper! Come on.
This is gonna be fun!
Oh, howdy there, folks.
Lester's is proud to present... the Possum Posse
Jamboree.
Here it is.
Oh, boy!
Just in time.
Howdy, folks.
Who's your favourite possum?
Lester!
Got us a seat right up front.
Let me introduce you to the posse.
Here's Beuford, Beulah and Mordachai.
Hey, Lester, ready for yodelin'?
Ha-ha-ha.
Sure am, Beuford!
# Now gather 'round my possum pals
Join the jamboree #
- # Come hoot and howl and holler from the heart #
- Ya-hoo!
This is pathetic.
- # Here in Lester's Possum Park #
- Join in, folks.
This is yodelin' time!
# Lester's Possum Park #
# Yodel-lay-ee ooo-ooo-ooo #
# Don't you wanna be
A- hangin' from a tree #
# We're mighty glad to see ya
And the parking's always free #
# Here at Lester's
Po-Po #
# Po-Possum Park #
# Doodle-do
Diddle-do ##
Hey, that's the ticket!
I'll be right back, my little possum pal.
My life's a living...
Hello, little buddy!
Who's your favourite possum?
Don't touch me.
Aw. Why such a long face?
You're so sad.
I know! You need a big hug from Lester.
- Don't even think about it! Agh! No!
- See?
Now you feel all good inside.
Beat it, doofus!
- Oh, no. No, Dad. Not that. Please.
- Here you go, sport.
What say we get our picture taken?
- You have got to be kidding.
- Oh, all right.
But you're missin' out.
Hiya, son!
Hey, everyone!
Check out the dork!
Say "sassafras."
Sassy-frass!
Screech!
Ahh! Get it! Get it!
That's the spirit,
Maxie!
Whoa! No!
Dad, stop! Please!
No!
Dad, look, this is embarrassing.
No, no, no!
Let go! Dad!
It's dork and dork, junior!
- Agh!
- Max!
Hey, what the heck you tryin' to do?
- Trying to get away from you!
- Me?
- What'd I do?
- Forget it!
I thought we was having fun.
What's the matter?
Nothin'.
Let's just go.
Well, come on!
Hey, you dropped your hat.
Aah! This is the stupidest vacation!
You drag me from home, you jam me in this dumb car, then drive me a million miles away to see some stupid rat show!
Call me when the trip's over.
Hey, Max. You wanna get in some fishin' practise?
Just a couple of days
'til we get to Lake Destiny.
Maybe later.
Whoa!
Now that's camping.
Did you say somethin',
Max? Ow!
- Pete?
- Goofy?
Oh-ho!
What a serendipity doo-dah!
Who'd've thunk it, huh?
Ha-ha.
- Is P.J. Here?
- Who? Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he's loafin' around here somewhere.
# It ain't a question of how
Just a matter of when #
- # You get the message that I'm trying to sing #
- Ooh, ooh, that baby.
# I'm under a spell
I'm in over my head #
- # And you know I'm goin' all of the way to the end #
- What a goob!
# To stand out above the crowd #
# Even if you got to shout out loud #
# No matter what the look is
Max, I get... #
- Max!
- H-H-Hey!
Whoa!
Small wilderness, dude.
- Didn't expect to run into you.
- Apparently not.
You're just jealous, man,
'cause you ain't got the moves!
Yeah, you can keep the moves.
But I wouldn't mind havin' this R.V. Oh!
- You are so lucky, man.
- Me? Oh, come on. You're the star.
- Wh-What do you...
- Going to the Powerline concert.
- Ah! It's unbelievable, man.
- Who told you about that?
Hey, come on. Everybody in town knows about it, Max.
You are gonna be famous, buddy.
Especially with Roxanne.
There's, uh, only one person who doesn't know about it yet, Peej.
- Who?
- My dad.
So tell me, Goof, is that kid of yours still givin' you guff?
Oh, I don't know what's wrong.
Just seems like everything I try only drives Max further away.
Maybe I oughta just back off.
I don't know.
Wrong, Goof.
Look, if you keep 'em under your thumb, they'll never end up in the gutter.
Too bad, Pete.
Almost.
Almost? Hah!
Watch this.
P.J.!
Here, sir. Comin', sir. Yes, sir.
Whoo-hoo!
Strike-ola!
Yee-haw! Thank you.
Thank you. Yes!
And the crowd goes wild!
Ahh-ha-ha-ha!
High five, son!
Psych!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Say, Goof, why don't you two stay for dinner?
- Cool!
- Oh, no thanks, Pete.
- Max and I have some fish to catch.
- Dad, we can do that tomorrow.
So, uh, what're we havin'?
- But, Max, I thought...
- A-A-Ahem! Under your thumb, Goof.
- Maximilian!
- What?
Get your gear, little man.
We're goin' fishin'!
And I mean now!
Dad, I don't even know how to fish.
Oh, now come on.
That never stopped me!
Let me show you a little family secret... handed down through about
12 or 13 Goof generations.
- The perfect cast!
- The perfect what?
The perfect cast. My dad taught it to me when I was about your age.
Okay now, watch carefully.
You gotta be l-l-loose.
Relaxed... with your feet apart.
And... 10:00,
Quarter to 3:00.
Tour jete.
Twist. Over.
Pas de deux.
# I'm a little teapot #
And the windup!
And let her fly!
The perfect cast.
And now we reel her in.
Quick, get the camera!
Must be over three pounds.
I don't wanna miss this!
Look, Max!
A... duh, duh, Dad?
It's Bigfoot!
Could you back up a bit, Mr Foot?
You're out of focus.
What's the idea?
Bigfoot!
Behold the legendary Bigfoot!
Fabled, but seldom...
Yeow-hoo-hoo!
- It's locked!
- Quick! The sunroof!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
I can't believe it!
Bigfoot!
And I got the only video!
We're gonna be famous!
Huh? Grrr.
Let's just get outta here.
Is he gone yet?
Nope. He's still here.
- Gee, Max, was that Bigfoot or your stomach?
Man, I'm starving.
Alphabet soup comin' up.
Uh, Dad?
Dad!
Stop playing around!
He's coming!
Music!
# You can tell by the way
I use my walk I'm a woman's man #
# No time to talk #
# I've been kicked around since I was born #
# But then it's all right
It's okay #
Well, it's nice to know this thing's good for somethin'.
#Stayin' alive, stayin' alive #
#Stayin' alive #
What's so funny?
"Hi, Dad" soup.
Don't tell me you don't remember
"Hi, Dad" soup!
Oh, come on.
Sure you do!
You used to spell things out using the letters, like, uh, "Hi, Dad,"
- or Maxie, or...
- Ambidextrous?
Yeah! That's...
Huh?
No!
Little words like...
- Hasta la vista?
- Like bye-bye.
- Or "I pledge allegiance"...
- Ayuk-ayuk. Or "I love you"...
Is, uh... is it soup yet?
Oh, oh.
I almost forgot.
Whoa!
Where'd you learn to do that?
Your granddad taught me that when we went to Yosemite.
You two did a lot together, huh?
Yep.
- Max, you and I...
- Dad, I'm sorry...
Um, um... how's the soup?
Not bad.
Um, not... Ahem.
- What?
- N-nothin'.
Well, we might as well get some shuteye.
I don't think we're goin' anywhere tonight.
Hi, Maxie.
"Dear Roxanne,
I couldn't sleep... so I thought I'd drop you a line.
Dad and I are having a great time!
We're only days away from L. A... and I can hardly wait for the big concert."
Ahh.
More "Hi, Dad" soup, please.
"Dear Roxanne, sorry I lied, but I'm not really going to the Powerline concert.
You may never want to see me again..."
Oh, man!
I'm dead no matter what I do!
How many cups of sugar does it take to get to the moon?
Ah... three and a half?
- Pickup.
- Hold your horses.
- Short stack?
- Right here.
Here you go, hun.
Eggs?
Eggs?
- Eggs!
- Uh-oh, yeah, yeah. Right here. Sorry.
Here you go, cutie.
- Max, I think we need to talk about this.
- Huh?
Seems to me you need to start taking some responsibility around here.
Excuse me. Can I have your attention, please?
A- A-Ahem!
I, Goofy, hereby dub my son
Maximilian...
Official Navigator and Head
"Which-Wayer" of this here road trip.
- Isn't that nice?
- Hee-haw!
- Seriously?
- I'm not even lookin' at the map any more.
As a matter of fact, you can pick all the stops from here to Lake Destiny.
I trust you wholeheartedly, son.
To the open road!
To the... open road!
Oh boy!
Gosh!
Check out the bed!
Check out the dresser!
Coral!
Nice lamp.
Classy choice there, navigator.
This is the police!
We've got the place surrounded, see?
You Goofs come out with your hands up.
You should've seen the look on your face!
- You really had him fooled, Pete!
- Me?
You jumped outta your skin!
I was just pretendin' for your sake.
- All right, sure!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Oh, ain't this sweet?
Don't let him fool you with that buddy-buddy act now. Under your thumb!
So... since we're all bein' palsy-walsy here,
- how 'bout lettin' me hook up the R.V.
- Well...
- Oh, it's just a little tiny extension cord. You'll hardly even notice it.
- Okay.
Great!
P.J.!
Hey, Goof, why don't you order us a pizza? This might take a while.
- No, I mean it... Ahh!
- Here you go, kids.
I'm gonna check out the hot tub.
- Okay, sir.
- All right.
I can't believe you, man.
Whatever made you think your dad would fall for a stupid idea like that?
- It wasn't stupid!
- Come on! It was really stupid.
Changing the map?
I didn't know what I was doin', all right? I-I was panicked.
Oof-oof-oof.
Oh-oh-ah-ah!
Ahh!
Taking a break from the M.T.V. Generation, huh?
Can't say as I blame ya.
People are always puttin' too much water in these things.
So, um... you and your son seem to be, uh, gettin' along just hunky-dory, huh?
Yeah!
It's been great!
You know, it's funny, but none of your techniques worked for me.
The harder I tried, the worse it got.
- Once I eased up, things just clicked!
- Oh, that's swell.
So, there's no problems then, huh?
Not a one!
That's uh...
I just hate to be...
- the bearer of bad news, but uh...
- What is it, Pete?
- Your kid's dupin' ya.
- What do you mean?
Well, I heard the little mutant tellin'
P.J. That he changed the map, so you're headin' straight to L.A., pal.
- What?
- Ahh, you tried, Goof.
- He's just a bad kid, that's all.
- I don't believe you.
- What?
- I don't believe ya, Pete!
Well hey, don't take my word for it.
Check your map.
I don't need to check the map.
I trust my son.
You know, maybe Max isn't all the things that you think a son should be.
But... he loves me.
Hey, my son respects me!
Yeah.
Check the map, Goof!
Hi, Dad.
Sorry about the mess.
I- I'll clean it up.
- Me think I better go.
- See ya, Peej.
- Don't forget... Powerline!
- Shh!
Well, here you go, navigator.
Just follow my route on the map, son.
Okay.
Here comes our junction.
Okay, Max, now this is it.
Left or right?
Uh...
Come on, Max!
Uh, l-left!
Uh... how 'bout a song, Dad?
Uh... a game? A game. Yeah!
Yeah, a game. Okay.
Uh... a man or woman?
A man? Man, okay.
Uh... Walt Disney!
Dad... listen, about my directions...
Will you listen to me?
I gotta tell you somethin', Dad.
Why bother? I'm probably too stupid to understand anyway.
Right?
Ahh, forget it.
H- H-Hey, the car!
- What? Now you want to drive too?
- No, Dad.
The car! Look!
The car!
- What'd you do now, Max?
- I didn't do anything, Dad.
I only touched it.
W- W-Whoa!
You locked it!
I locked it? It's your door.
You locked it.
Well, you distracted me.
Whoa!
You should've put the brake on.
Why don't you just put it on yourself?
See?
You ruin everything.
W- well, y-you r-ruined the vacation.
I ruined it?
- I never... wanted to go... on this stupid... vacationnnnnn!
Ahh! Ahh!
- Now look where you've got us, Dad!
- Where I got us?
- You should've let me stay at home.
- Why?
So you'd end up in prison?
Prison?
What are you talkin' about?
- Your principal called me.
- It's not what you think.
You even lied to me!
I had to!
You were ruining my life.
I was only tryin' to take my boy fishin', okay?
I'm not your little boy any more, Dad!
I've grown up.
I've got my own life now.
I know that!
I just wanted to be part of it.
You're my son, Max.
No matter how big you get, you'll always be my son.
# There are times you drive me, shall we say, bananas #
- # And your mind is missin', no offence, a screw #
- None taken.
# Still whatever mess
I land in #
# Who is always understandin' #
# Nobody else but you #
# Oh, your moodiness is now and then bewilderin' #
# And your values may be, so to speak, askew #
- Gesundheit.
- Thanks.
# Who deserves a hero's trophy #
# As we face each "catastro-phee" #
# Nobody else but you #
# Nobody else but you #
# It's just our luck #
# We're stuck together #

# With nobody else #
# But Y-O-U ##
Aw, Dad!
Anyway, I figure she's never gonna want to talk to me again, much less go out with me.
- What a dumb lie, huh?
- What do you know?
My Maxie... in love.
Gosh, you're really growin' up.
It happened so fast...
I guess I sort of missed it.
Well, I think the only thing for us to do now... is to get you up onstage with this Powerline feller.
Uh, how are we gonna do that?
- Well, you just leave that up to me.
- No, Dad, really,
I- I think we should just, you know, forget it.
Now how come you always think I'm gonna lead you into some sort of calamity?
Uh, uh, Dad? Dad?
- What's wrong now?
- Look!
A waterfall!
Waterfall!
Dad!
Max!
Grab ahold, Max!
No!
No!
Dad!
Tour jete.
Twist. # I'm a little teapot #
Let her fly!
The perfect cast.
Boy, this has been one crazy vacation.
And it's not over yet!
- Dad.
- Oof. We made it!
Come on, Max.
Let's get you onstage.
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
- # Yeah, yeah #
Ooh, then again...
Dad? Dad!
# Hey yeah #
# I got myself a notion #
# One I know that you'll understand #
# We set the world in motion #
# By reaching out for each other's hand #
- Dad?
- # Maybe we'll discover #
# What we should have known all along #
- What are you doin' here? Hey!
- # Yeah #
- Max? Max?
- # One way or another #
# Together's where we both belong #
# If we listen to each other's heart #
# We'll find we're never too far apart #
# And maybe love is the reason why #
# For the first time ever we're seein' it 1-2-1I #
That Goof kid ain't there.
Don't worry, he'll be there.
# Seein' it l-2-I
Seein' it l-2-I #
Excuse me.
# Seein' it l-2-I #
- # I think we're seein' it #
- Max?
Hey, Dad. Dad!
Do the perfect cast.
# If you're ever lonely #
# Stop
You don't have to be #
# After all it's only a beat away from you to me #
# Take a look inside to see #
# Yeah, if we listen to each other's heart #
Yeah! Max is on the tube!
That's Max. I know him!
# And maybe love is the reason why #
# For the first time ever we're seein' it l-2-I #
He did it!
# Seein' it l-2-I #
# Seein' it l-2-I, baby #
- # For the first time #
- # For the first time #
- # Seein' it, seein' it, baby #
- Yeah!

- # For the first time ever
Yeah, yeah, yeah #
- # Come on, baby #
- # l-2-I #
- # l-2-I #
# l-2-I #
# Yeah ##
You're doin' the right thing, son.
Yeah, I know. But she'll probably never talk to me again.
Well, if she doesn't, maybe she's just not the one for you.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Grrr.
Ah, hi!
Remember me?
Daddy!
Max, I saw you on TV.
You were great!
Yeah?
I mean, no, no.
I mean, uh...
Roxanne, I lied to you.
I don't even know Powerline.
What are you talking about?
A billion people saw you dance with him.
Yeah, well...
I never met him before... the concert, that is.
You mean that story about Powerline and your dad?
- Why would you make up something like that?
- I don't know.
I guess I just... wanted you to like me.
I already liked you,
Max.
From the very first time
I heard you laugh.
"Ayuk."
- So, you wanna do something tonight?
- Definitely!
- Oh! Oh, no, I can't. I can't.
- What?
Well, I'm kinda doin' somethin' with my dad.
Honest!
- How 'bout tomorrow?
- Deal.
Roxanne, I'd like you to meet my dad.
Enchante, mademoiselle.

Yeow-hoo-hoo-hooee!
Alan, every ten-year-old is afraid of something.
The kid's afraid of tuna-fish sandwiches.
Mercury levels in the tuna.
Whatever.
Alan, the world is a frightening place to him right now.
I think we could be a little more supportive.
Supportive? I'm the most supportive father on earth, but I'm running out of supportive things to do.
I signed him up for Little
League, he drove everybody crazy with statistics about how you can develop tumors from being hit in the head with a ball.
Did you know that shin splints can lead to blood clots in the legs?
Claire, he brought in a medical journal.
Nobody wanted to play after that.
And now I'm building him a tree house, in a tree he refuses to climb.
You know he hates heights.
I don't know. I just want to be a good father.
But you are a good father.
I'm OK! I'm OK!
Aah! No, I'm not!
Hey. Rich!
Well?
You like it?
Uh, yeah, it's great, Dad.
Hey, how about bringing me up that bag of nails?
No, come on up!
Look. Solid as a rock.
Dad, eight percent of all household accidents involve ladders.
Another three percent involve trees.
We're looking at 11 percent probability here.
Fine. Just put the bag in the bucket, OK?
- Rich.
- Huh?
Ow!
Oh! Oh!
Dad! Do you have feeling in your toes?
Yes, I have feeling in my toes.
Oh, Alan, honey, are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine. Oh!
Can't argue with statistics, Dad.
Statistics. Here's something you can do, go down to Gutman's Hardware
Store, buy a pound of these.
But, Dad...
Son, you can't live your life based on statistics.
You've gotta take some chances.
Now come on, buddy.
You can do this.
This is not good.
Definitely not good.
- All right!
- Whoa! Good one!
You went further that time.
- All right! Way to go, dude!
- All right, line it up.
Hey, guys, look, it's Richie Tyler.
Hey, check out his clothes. Hey,
Tyler, where you going, the moon?
Get cable in that thing, Tyler?
Hey, what's the matter, you chicken?
What's the matter, wuss, forgot your training wheels?
Uhh!
Uhh!
No cranial damage.
Oh!
Hello?
Welcome to the library, young man.
Don't tell me. You're here for a special book.
- Mister...
- Stop, stop, stop. Allow me to guess.
I have a talent for guessing what people need.
You're in need of... a fantasy.
Brave knights, mythical fairies, ferocious dragons.
Look, all I want is...
Adventure!
Of course. You're a boy who loves adventure!
Brimming with wicked demons, cutthroat pirates...
No, no, that's not it.
Horror!
Horror! Evil demons!
Wretched monsters! Haunted houses!
Graveyards!
Yes.
It's horror for you, boy.
I'm sure of it.
Your library card, please.
I don't have one.
You do now.
Sign here.
Richard Tyler.
Consider this your passport to the wonderful, quite unpredictable world of books.
But I don't want any books.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I only came in here 'cause of the storm.
You mean you don't need...
Oh.
I see.
Is there a phone where
I can call my parents?
Through there.
Proceed in a northeasterly direction until you get to the rotunda, and from there head west through the fiction section.
And you'll find it. A public telephone. You can't miss it.
Don't be afraid, boy.
If you lose your way, merely direct yourself back to the exit sign.
Wow!
Jeez!
Whoa! Oh!
Hello?
Uh-oh.
Huh?
Oh! Uhh!
Uhh!
Help!
Mister, mister, where's the exit?
Help!
Wha...
Huh?
I'm... I'm a cartoon!
You... are an illustration.
Who... who are you?
I am the Pagemaster, keeper of the books and guardian of the written word.
You're the guy from up there!
Where are the others?
Why, they're here, of course! And all around.
Maybe you can show me the way out?
Follow me.
I-Is that the way?
Oh, the only way.
Fiction, A to Z!
Where all is possible!
Where a boy's imagination can take root and grow to incredible heights!
Where a boy's courage is a wind that moves him to discovery!
And where your journey begins!
Uhh!
Whoa!
To find your way home, you must face three tests, horror, adventure and fantasy.
And remember this, when in doubt, look to the books!
Aah! How do you stop this thing?
I am the ghost of Christmas past...
All the pirates shared a grave.
Due to the storm, all lines have been temporarily disconnected.
Please try your call again later.
Oh! Ow!
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
Where's the son of a sea biscuit knocked me from me crow's nest?
Where's he be? Where's he be?
So here be the lubber who knocked me on me poop deck, and with no apologies too!
You fiction or nonfiction?
I'm... Richard. Richard Tyler.
- What kind of a book would that be?
- Uh, I'm not a book.
Got any proof?
See? Here's my name!
A library card!
Oh, begging your pardon, lad.
I didn't know you was a customer!
Uh, look, all I wanna do is get outta here.
Of course you do, matey! We all do.
But this is a library, mate.
Not everything's as it seems.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
You... you said you knew the way out?
I know these waters like the back of me hook!
Uh... Uh...
This way.
I gotta get home.
My parents are probably worried sick about me.
Well, I'm afeared
I've been dry-docked in this library far longer than I'd like to remember.
As I sees it, you with your library card are me ticket out of here!
Is it a deal, matey?
Ooh, I'm naked.
Uh, yeah, I guess so.
That's the spirit, lad!
Can we get going now?
Aye aye! Let's scale this mast and get our bearings!
Mast? That's a ladder. I kind of have this thing about heights.
Huh. I'll take care of that.
Mysterious Island. Yes.
Kidnapped.
Ah, here we be! 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea.
Ah, the squid, yes, that's it!
It's a giant squid!
Ah!
Whoa!
Ohh!
Jump, boy!
It's jump for your life!
Ohh!
Uhh!
Let go of my face! I can't breathe!
What are you doing, grabbing me like that and messing up my pantyhose?
Hmph! Now I gotta straighten out my Little Mermaid underwear.
Who... who are you?
I'm Fantasy. Oh!
I'm Fantasy! What is this?
Hm.
It's a library card.
I'm a book, honey. I can read.
Now tell me, what's the one thing you wish for more than anything in the world?
Anything in the world?
L-I'd like to get out of here.
I'll grant your wish, child. But you must do me one small kindness in return.
You gotta check me outta here!
That's it? OK, let's go!
Do I have to click my heels or something?
Honey, you in the wrong story.
That was a close one, lad. Lad?
Hold on there, missis!
The lad's with me!
- You know that short story?
- Yeah, he's adventure.
Honey, that's what they all say.
I heard that! I'll have you know I'm a classic!
Mm-hm. A classic... misprint.
Why, you old sea serpent! I'll rip out your pages and use them for... Oh, no!
Do something!
Hm.
Oops! I forgot. My wand doesn't always work outside the fantasy section.
You mean you can't wish us to the exit?
That overdue shrew's never even seen the exit.
More than you have, shorty!
In fact, the exit's just beyond my fantasy section. Hmph!
Then what are ye doing in these parts?
There a witches' convention around here, maybe?
Look, I was misshelved.
But that's over, now that young Prince
Charming here has come to check me out.
My good eye, he is.
The lad's checking me out!
Come on, boy, we're wasting time chumming off this dinghy.
It's on to the exit for us!
If he thinks the exit's in that direction, you know it's got to be in this one!
Don't listen to her, mate. She's not sailing with a full crew!
Ah-ah-ah!
Fantasy! She's a bloody nightmare.
Let's leave him. He doesn't even know where we are now!
Bilge water! Of course I know where we are! We're...
Hound of the Baskervilles.
We're in Baskervilles.
Have a look-see!
Hm. Huh?
Hey, this way! Through here!
Nice doggy! Good doggy!
Hurry!
Oh, baby.
Are we still in the library?
Aye, lad. The horror section.
It looks pretty scary.
That it does. Just stay close to me and... and you got nothing to worry about.
Mm-hm.
There it is! The exit!
Looks like the only way to reach the exit is through that there house.
No way I'm going in there.
It's your only chance, boy.
It's just a house.
Yeah, but 70 percent of all accidents are household-related.
Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde.
Must be a duplex.
Whoa!
Go ahead, matey. I'm...
I'm right behind ye.
Well? Ring the bell.
Ohh!
- Good catch!
- Here, take it.
Isn't he sweet?
Oh, I scared you.
I'm sorry!
You mustn't judge a book by its cover.
Look, he's smiling!
That's a smile?
All right, teatime's over.
Let's start navigating this house.
Huh? No, wait! Don't go in there!
It's scary inside!
Ha! I ain't afeared of nothing!
I'm afraid.
Of what?
Or, of...
And... Aah!
And...
And...
Uh, I know how you feel.
Horror always has sad endings.
I come from a world of happy endings.
Why don't you come with us?
Yeah! And maybe you could help us through the house.
Through the house? Hm.
Uh.
You can do it.
'Kay.
Friend?
Oops!
Come on!
Hm?
He-hello?
A-anybody home?
What was that?
Nevermore!
Get me out of here!
May I assist you in some way?
Oh. Hello there, Mr...?
Doctor. Dr. Jekyll.
Well, sir, we did ring the bell.
It's all my fault. I was trying to help them find their way to the other side of the house.
The other side?
My boy, I derive no pleasure in telling you that you are in extreme danger.
- Danger?
- Even as we speak.
Lurking in this very room, waiting to strike, are forces of evil.
Wait for me! Wait for me!
Every man is possessed of both good... and evil.
Oh, yes.
But enough of that.
Anyone care for a drink?
Hm?
Ah.
I'll have a go with you, doc.
Ooh!
Stay back! This is a man's drink!
Can I have the olive?
Oh!
Uh-oh.
Now look what you've done!
Whoa!
Ooh!
No! No, no! Don't drink it!
Don't, don't!
Dr... Jekyll?
Dr. J?
My name is... Mr. Hyde!
Easy, there!
The stairs, mateys, the stairs!
Ahh!
Help, master! Don't leave me!
This is no way to treat a library book. Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Honey, you got to help him!
But I... I...
Oh!
At least this wand is good for something.
Come on!
Which way?
Down. Definitely down.
No, up. Definitely up! Up, up, up!
Come on!
What's going on?
Ghost stories.
Ha ha!
Get me outta here!
Aah!
Close the door!
Whoa!
Down there? I... I can't.
Come on, boy! Even books have spines.
Come, master!
I can do this. I can do this.
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh!
Reach deep within yourself, Richard.
Seize the courage.
Uhh! Uhh!
Whoa!
- Yay! You did it! You did it!
- Grand, boy!
Hooray, hooray, hooray.
Wow.
Do ya smell it?
Breathe it in, mateys.
Ha ha!
The land of adventure!
Look! There's the exit!
Hey! Wait for me!
Ha ha ha!
Home, sweet home!
There's only room for one up here.
From now on, it'll be smooth sailin'!
What are ya laughin' at?
Whoa!
Uhh!
A boat!
Is it... safe?
I wrote the book on sailin'. In fact, I am the book on sailin'.
I'm impressed.
We're sinking. We're going down!
Somebody do something!
Thank you.
Shove off, lads!
Jeez, the water looks kind of choppy.
Maybe we should've stayed back there where it was safe.
Whalin' men.
It's Cap'n Ahab, it is!
Another guy with a peg leg.
Mm-hm. Seems to be a fashion statement around here.
- Did you see it?
- See what?
The devil of the deep.
The white whale.
- Hm?
- Moby Dick!
Thar she blows!
I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!
He's possessed!
He's insane!
He's my kind of guy!
Look!
It's headed straight for them!
Thou damned whale!
Thus, I give up the spear!
So, you think I scared it?
He shouldn't swim right after eating, you know. He'll get cramps.
Where did he go?
Aah!
Row! Row for your lives!
Guys! Where are you?
Adventure? Boy, am I ever glad to see you.
Huh?
All right, all right!
Where's Horror?
And Fantasy?
Where are they?
I searched for 'em as much as I could, mate.
I'm afraid... I'm afraid they've gone below with Davy Jones.
No. It can't be.
You guys are the only friends I've ever had.
She's a cruel sea, lad.
They gotta be out there.
Horror!
Fantasy!
Sharks!
We may be joining them other two sooner than you think.
Hey, look!
Help, help! Over here!
Careful, mate. Not all sharks are in the water.
Get us out of here!
This way! Help!
It's a good thing you guys came along.
Ohh! We're missing two others about his size. Did you see 'em?
He's all the catch we've had today.
Huh?
I knew it! It's him!
Who?
The meanest, black-hearted pirate that ever sailed the seven seas.
Long John Silver!
Just set your keel down, mate.
John Silver's expecting live company.
Uhh!
Give the word, Cap'n Silver, sir, and
I'll show you the color of his insides.
Red! Red! They're red!
Stow your cutlass, Tom Morgan.
I want a better look at his outsides first.
Long John Silver!
Aye, lad, the very same.
Well, seeing as how me men plucked you out of the water like a drownin' field rat, you'll be joinin' our happy family as our new cabin boy.
Thanks, but I already have a family.
I really should be getting home now.
Oh, I think you are home.
Heh heh heh heh.
John Silver! Touch one hair on that boy's head, and you'll be answerin' to me!
Well, come aboard, matey! Ha ha.
Uhh!
You wouldn't happen to be going after me treasure, would you, now?
You ain't got any treasure worth goin' after!
- No treasure?
- No treasure?
He's lyin'! There's plenty of treasure for all of ya!
Search him!
The boy, too.
Hm.
Why, looky here.
Here he be, Cap'n.
What might this here be?
Money! It's yours! Keep it!
- Money, he says!
- Keep it, he says!
- Hm. Library card.
- Library card?
A cabin boy don't need no library card.
I'd like to get out of here!
Land ho!
Land ho!
There she be, mateys!
Treasure Island!
Stay on your toes, mate. When they go for the gold, we'll make our break.
Quit your squawkin'!
Look to the map. What's it say?
It's, uh, in the middle, by the waterfall.
No, it's east by some broccoli.
- Give me that!
- Broccoli.
You half-wits!
It's west, by a tree!
East, by broccoli!
They're all idiots.
What sort of way is that for bones to lie?
It ain't natural.
This island's haunted.
It's accursed, it is!
Oh, you're all yellow dogs.
Open your eyes. The bones is the compass pointin' the way to the doubloons.
It's gone!
Dig deeper, boys!
I say, dig deeper!
Find the treasure!
One gold piece. This is your treasure, is it?
Let's kill him and eat his parrot.
Stand by for trouble.
We mighta known you'd double-cross us.
Throw down your weapons, John Silver!
Why, you pack of back-bitin' dogs!
You'll be regrettin' this, George Merry.
Save your speeches.
Dead men don't bite.
16 men on a dead man's stomach...
No! No! Chest! Chest!
Chest! Chest!
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum!
Evil spirits.
Sanctuary!
Ohh.
Horror! You're alive!
Not for long. Hee hee hee hee hee!
Aah!
Ohh!
Ohh-Ohh!
Ahchoo!
Fantasy!
Naturally. Well, who were you expecting, honey, the tooth fairy?
Get them!
Ha ha! At last, a good fight!
Aah!
Uhh!
Get me outta here!
Hey!
Why, you...
Uhh!
Get the boat, boy. We're gonna be shovin' off.
I'm not going with you.
The sword, honey. Get the sword.
Don't even think it, boy.
He ain't got the heart.
Hyah! Uhh!
Stay back!
Avast there, laddie.
Somebody could get hurt with that blade you got thar.
Be careful, master.
In the boat.
Huh? Easy now, matey.
Easy. I'm goin'.
Right ye are.
Into the boat, aye aye.
Ye be a hard lad, Richard Tyler.
Good sailin' to ya, shipmate.
15 men on a dead man's chest
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum
- Way to go, honey.
- Yes!
Whew. Oh, I wish my dad coulda seen me.
Boy, I thought you two were goners.
We almost were, until this enchanting fellow discovered he could float.
It's hollow.
- Who's there?
- Adventure!
Adventure who?
What do you mean, Adventure who?
Open the blasted door, you dog-eared...
Aah!
Perfect timing.
I was just thanking these guys for saving us.
I coulda taken the lot of 'em with one hand tied behind me back!
That's just his way of saying thanks.
You're welcome!
Ahoy, matey!
Aye, we're lusty adventurous men.
Go away. You don't know what you're talkin' about.
L-I know I'm not your favorite kind of book, but I could be just like you.
You'll never be Adventure!
Ye ain't got the spine for it.
And take that stupid thing off!
Sorry.
Thinks he can be a pirate!
Seize the courage, Richard, then you will reach the exit.
I'll never get home.
You did good, honey.
I lost the library card.
I can't check anybody out.
We'll never get to the exit now.
Honey, never say "never" around Fantasy, because sometimes you've got to fight to make a wish come true.
So come on. Don't quit on me now.
Yeah.
Huh! That crazy hunchbook. Ahh.
You don't see me pretending to be Horror.
Why are you sittin' around like a bunch of 0l' wenches at teatime?
Pick one.
Mmm...
That one.
My library card!
I wrestled it away from three sharks who was eyein' it for breakfast.
At no small threat to me life, neither.
Mm-hm.
Where's Horror? Wasn't he with you?
He was, but he, uh... I mean,
I sort of, uh... He, uh...
What did you say to him now?
Well, I, uh... I, uh...
I just, uh, uh...
I'll go find him.
Yeah, you better go find him.
And be quick about it!
Horror!
Horror!
Horror!
Horror.
Hang on, mate! I'm coming!
You're lucky I was published with a thick hide!
Hm?
Come back, ya jellyfish!
Speak to me, mate.
Ye had a good heart and ye was braver than ye knew.
I... I'd walk the plank if I thought it would bring ye back.
That's beautiful.
Huh?
This is too cute.
Uhh!
Are you OK?
Thanks to my friend here.
Get off me!
Did you see that?
See what?
My wand! It's blinkin'!
That can only mean one thing.
The exit!
- The checkout!
- A happy ending.
Ohh!
Let's go! Come on!
Are you sure that swizzle stick of yours is workin' right?
Hm.
I don't know. Maybe we should test it.
You've gone overboard, missis!
Whatever you imagine
Is where your heart can go
There are worlds filled with treasure
Time without measure
To learn whatever you may need to know
Imagine
Imagine
You and I could fly...
- Look! Mother Goose!
- Hey, girl!
And leave all our doubts and fears behind...
Hello, my little baby. Hi!
You see, that's just what can happen
If you look inside your mind
There's no limit to the wonders
You can find
Whatever you imagine
Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine can come true
Wait for me!
Hey! Come here!
Those are my glasses!
Hey! Don't go up there!
What's the matter? Is
Adventure afraid to go in?
What? I live for moments like this.
Look! There it is! The exit!
Me sword! Uhh!
Earthquake!
Quick! Find page 1,001.
Arabian Nights?
That's it!
Ohh!
Get the boy!
Come on! The exit's up there!
We're gonna make it!
- Hooray! We're gonna make...
- Aah! My wand!
Oh, baby. I wish that hadn't happened.
Come on, guys! The exit!
This way, guys!
Aah!
We're almost there!
We made it!
Guys?
This dragon is history!
Don't try to stop me!
Be careful.
Huh? Hm.
You really are a classic.
Mmm!
How would you like to curl up with a good book?
Oh, me binding!
In your dreams!
Ooh!
Adventure, up here!
Go on, lad! Save yourself!
You think a bag of hot air is enough to stop me?
Dragon? He's more like a dragonfly, he is!
Look out!
Uhh.
Happy birthday.
Hang on, guys! I'm coming!
A sword.
Yes!
Ha ha! That's it, boy!
Go for the gizzard!
Bite him, bite him!
Aah!
Yah!
- Watch out for his tail!
- You've got him on the run!
Aah!
I'm not scared of you!
Aah!
Aah!
Huh?
Aah!
I gotta get out of here.
Aah!
Fantasy's wand!
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
Uh-oh.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books!
Alice in Wonderland.
Off with his head!
Sheesh!
Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
Jack and the Beanstalk.
Yeah! This is it!
I hate heights!
Aah!
Matey!
He's alive!
Aah!
Come on, guys!
Uhh!
Whew.
Are you all right?
Wh... wha...
Master, you saved us!
That ya did, matey.
Baby, you're the greatest.
Mm-wah!
Who's there?
The Pagemaster.
Hey! How'd you get here?
Quit it! We're in the presence of the Pagemaster.
I know who he is! He's the guy who did all this to me!
Do you have any idea what I've been through?
Tell me.
I was nearly torn apart by a crazy doctor.
I was made a slave by a bunch of mangy pirates, and eaten, got that, eaten by a fire-breathing dragon!
He don't mean it, my
Pagemaster. He don't mean it.
Not to mention being tossed, squashed and scared practically to death.
Yet you stand before me.
Well... yeah.
Think, boy! What kind of an adventure would you have had if I'd brought you here with the turn of a page?
You prevailed over evil.
Ah, you looked Moby
Dick in the eye, boy.
Ah, you had pirates tough, me lad, and don't no one speak any different.
If I had brought you here from the start, you never would have found the courage to face your own fears.
And in doing so, you triumph here and always.
Hey, is that... That's me!
That was you.
I'm ready to go home now.
I mean, we're ready.
The world awaits.
Whoa!
Godspeed to you, boy!
Wait for me!
Aah!
You took quite a spill, young man.
Huh?
Are you all right?
Careful! You'll slip again!
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait! Uh, I forgot something.
Here.
I'm afraid you can only check out two.
Horror? But I promised him.
You promised whom?
- Look, I need... Just this once?
- Shh.
I have a talent for guessing what people need.
Just this once.
Shh.
Yes!
Good. That was definitely good.
I can't imagine where he could be.
Maybe we should call the police.
Alan!
He's home.
Alan.
It's impossible.
Rich?
We probably should put him in his bed.
Let's let him sleep up here tonight.
Love you, Richie.
Good night, son.
It's dark out here. I wish there was a night-light.
Honey, wish granted.
Ooh.
Hooray! Hooray!
Breathe it in, mateys.
This be the land of adventure.
You can lay to that.
Come here, handsome.
Why you cryin'?
Because I have friends.
That you do, matey.
Aye, that you do.
Ahem.
You know what would make this a happy ending?
A kiss.
OK.
I meant from her!
When this world
The real-life world
You're livin' in
Just gets too much
For you to take
When you find
Too many troubles on your mind
And feel just like
There's no escape

Remember when
A dream could take you anywhere
Anywhere you want to
Just a wish
Anything could be

Take a look in your heart
'Cause that's where dreams always start
Anything is real
If you just believe
Believe, believe
Ohh, Ohh, ohh
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far
As your heart can see
Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Everything is...
Just a dream away
All it takes is faith to make your dreams come true
Oh, oh
And somewhere in this world
There'll be somebody
To share your dreams
With you
Hey
Yeah, oh, yeah
Ohh
Oh, yeah, oh
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far
As your heart can see
Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Is just a dream
Just a dream
Away
Yeah
Whatever you imagine
Can one day come to be
There are dreams to awaken
Roads to be taken
Follow them and they will set you free
Whatever you imagine
ls where your heart can go
There are worlds filled with treasure
Time without measure
To learn whatever
You may need to know
Imagine
Imagine
You and I
Could fly past the sun
And leave all our doubts and fears
Behind us

If you look inside your mind
There's no limit to the wonders
You can find
Whatever you imagine
Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine can come true
Whatever you imagine
Whatever you imagine
Whatever you imagine
- Can make your life brand-new
- Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine
Will come true

Uh, guys, you're broke!
-You got nothin' to bet with!
-Oh, yeah? I got this!
-[Man]A map!
-A map?
-A map!
A map of the wonders of the New World.
-Wow! Let's have a look.
-[Scoffs]
[Indistinct Muttering]
Uh, Tulio!
-Excuse us, for one moment, please.
-Tulio, look!
-El Dorado, the city of gold.
-[Sighs]
This could be our destiny, our fate.
Miguel, if I believed in fate,
I wouldn't be playing with loaded dice.
-Hmmm. [Chuckling]
-Not with the face. No, no, no, no, no.
-No! No! No!
-[Whimpering, Panting]
I said one more roll!
My map against your cash.
-Hmm?
-[Dice Clattering]
-All right, peewee. You're on!
-Not with those!
This time we use my dice.
Ehh, got a problem with that?
[Whimpers] No.
[Whispers]
I'm going to kill you.
Come on, baby.
Papa needs that crappy map.
[Giggles]
-[Scoffs]
-[Blows]
Stop that!
Show me seven!
[Gasps]
[Crowd Exclaims, Cheers]
-Seven!
-All right!
-Seven!
-[Groans]
[Laughing] There it is!
Well, nice doing business with you.
-[Grunting] I knew it!
-[Crowd Gasping]
[Gasps]
Your dice are loaded!
What?
You gave me loaded dice?
[Grunts]
-He gave me loaded dice!
-[Crowd Murmurs]
-Guard, arrest him!
-You dare to impugn my honor?
He was the one who was cheating!
Arrest him! He tricked these sailors and took their money!
-Oh, now, I'm the thief?
-Yes.
Take a look in the mirror, pal!
Oh, you better give them that money back, or I'll--
-En garde!
-En garde, yourself.
I will give you the honor of a quick and painless death.
But not with that. Ha!
I prefer to fight fairly. Aha!
-[Growls]
-Well, any last words?
I will cut you to ribbons,
-fool!
-Such mediocrity.
Let your sword do the talking.
-I will.
It will be loquacious to a fault!
-Ha! Take that!
[Both Grunting]
-You... mincing, fencing, twit.
-Ah, you fight like my sister.
I fought your sister.
That's a compliment.
-Braggart!
-Heathen!
-[Man] Kill him!
-Not the face. Not the face.
[All Gasping, Clamoring]
Ladies and gentlemen, we've decided it's a draw.
[Miguel]
Thank you all for coming.
-You've been great. See you soon.
-Adios!
-Congratulations. You're very good.
-No. That was good.
-Very--
-[Snort]
-[Gasping]
-[Mooing, Snorting]
-We should have kept our swords, I think.
-Y-Yeah.
-[Snorting]
-[Tulio Whispering]
Yeah, I've got a plan.
-What is it?
-Uh, well-Uh, you...
-pet him, and... I'll...
-Yeah. run!
-Uh, well, thanks a lot!
-[Bull Bellowing]
[Both] Whoa!
-There they are!
-[Hooves Screeching]
[Male Chorus]Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
-[Woman Screaming]
-Bye. Thank you!
-[All Gasping]
-[Bellowing]
[Chorus] Olé
[Groans]
[Fabric Ripping]
[Both Grunting]
-Uhh--
-Ohh--
-I'll bet we can make that.
-[Men Shouting]
-[Guard] There they are!
-Two pesetas says we can't.
You're on!
[Both Yelling]
-[Miguel] You lose!
-[Coins Jingling]
-[Miguel]Ohhh!
-[Tulio] Whoa! What's happening here?
We're both in barrels.
That's the extent of my knowledge.
[Muffled Grunts, Groans]
Okay, Miguel, we gotta move fast.
-On three, we jump out and head for the dock.
-Good. Good. Excellent.
[Together]
One, two, three--
-[Both Grunting] Th-Three!
-[Creaking]
-[Both Straining] Three! Ohh!
-[Creaking Continues]
[Straining]
Three!
[Tulio]Uh, you ready?
Ah, okay. One more. Let's go.
[Together]
One, two, three!
-[Fly Buzzing]
-[Wind Whistling]
-Excuse us.
-Okay. We're outta here.
-Who ordered the, uh, pickles?
-[Sailor Laughing]
[Grunting]
Cortes!
-My crew was as carefully chosen as the disciples of Christ.
-[Cracks Knuckles]
-And I will not tolerate stowaways.
-[Gulps]
You will be flogged.
And when we put into Cuba to resupply,
God willing, you will be flogged some more... and then enslaved on the sugar plantations... for the rest of your miserable lives.
To the brig.
All right!
Cuba!
-[Gasps]
-[Gasps]
[Whistling]
-[Chuckles]
-[Nickers]
Hey, Altivo!
Ah-ta-ta, not for you!
You're on half rations.
Orders from Cortes.
-[Gasps]
-[Banging]
[Banging Continues]
So, uh, how's the--
How's the escape plan coming?
All right.
All right. Wait!
-I'm getting something.
-Yeah.
Okay!
Here's the plan.
-In the dead of night, you and I grab some provisions,
-Mm-hm. hijack one of those long boats, and then we row back to Spain like there's no mañana!
-Back to Spain, yeah?
-Yeah.
-In a rowboat.
-You got it!
Great. Sensational.
And that-that's your plan, is it?
-That's pretty much it.
-Well, I like it.
-So, how do we get on deck?
-Umm.
In the dead of night, you and I grab some provisions,
-hijack one of those longboats--
-Uh, great.
Okay, what's your idea, smart guy?
Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Don't ask me that! You're the one with the plans.
-[Horse Whinnying]
- Wait, I-I have an idea.
Uh, come on. Give me--
Give me a boost.
Hey, Altivo.
Altivo.
You want a nice apple?
Come and get it.
-[Hooves Clattering]
-You have to do a trick for me first.
Huh?
[Sputtering]
All you have to do is find a pry bar.
A long piece of iron with a hooky thing at the end. Yeah?
-Miguel, you're talking to a horse!
-[Hooves Clattering]
That's it, Altivo, find the pry bar.
-Yes, find the prybar.
-[Whinnying]
-He can't understand "pry bar."
-[Clattering Continues]
He's a dumb horse.
There's no way--
[Whinnying]
Well, it's not a pry bar.
-[Wind Howling]
-[Ship Creaking]
-[Gasps]
-[Nickers]
Oh, Altivo.
Oh, thank you, old boy.
Listen, if we can ever return the favor--
For Pete's sake, Miguel, he's a ruthless warhorse, not a poodle.
Come on, before he licks you to death.
-Adios.
-[Whinnies]
Shh, shh. Shh.
Quiet, please.
-What's the matter with him?
-Oh, he wants his apple.
-Well, give it to him before he wakes the whole ship!
-[Bellowing]
-Fetch!
-[Whinnying] Huh?
[Snoring]
[Gasps]
Hmm?
[Hoof beats Clatter, Stop Abruptly]
-Huh?
-Huh?
-[Whinnying]
[Whinnying]
-Altivo!
-Huh? Miguel!
[Yelling]
-Altivo, I'm coming!
-Miguel!
Just hang on!
I'm right here, old boy!
-Have you lost your mind?
-Help is coming!
[Gasps]
Ho-o-ly ship!
[Miguel, Tulio] Whoa!
[All Gasping]
-Loop the rope under the horse!
-Yes!
On the count of three, pull back on the rope.
-What? [Gasps]
-Three!
-[Tulio] Pull!
-[Grunting]
Tulio!
Hey, it worked!
Did any of the supplies make it?
-Well, uh, yes and no.
-[Crunching Sound]
Ohhh, great!
Look on the positive side.
At least things can't get--
Excuse me.
Were you going to say "worse"?
-No. No.
-No? You're sure?
-Absolutely not.
I've revised the whole thing.
-Okay, because--
-[Tulio] Yeah, we're at least in a rowboat.
-We're in a rowboat, exactly.
[Miguel]
You miss nothing.
[Grunting, Groaning]
-[Grunting, Groaning Continue]
-[Whinnying]
[Yelling]
-[Groaning]
-[Gasps]
[Together] Ahh!
[Coughs]
[Smacking Lips]
[All Sobbing]
Tulio, did you ever imagine it would end like this?
-The horse is a surprise.
-[Nickers]
Any... regrets?
Besides dying?
Yeah.
I never... had enough... gold.
My regret, besides dying, is... our greatest adventure is over before it began, and no one will even remember us.
Well, if it's any consolation, Miguel, you... made my life... an adventure.
[Sobbing]
And if it's any consolation,
Tulio, [Sniffles]
-you made my life... rich.
-[Sobbing Continues]
[Scoffs, Sputters]
[Both Sobbing]
[Shuddering Gasp]
[Moans]
-[Gasps] Is it?
-Hmm. [Gasps]
It is! It's-It's--
It's-It's-It's--
[Both] It's land!
-[Both Screaming]
-[Whinnying]
All in favor of getting back in the boat, say "aye."
-Aye!
-Aye! Go!
-[Nickers]
Hey, Miguel!
I could use a little help!
Miguel!
Hello!
Tulio!
We've done it!
-What's that? The map?
-It's all right here!
You still have the map?
The whistling rock!
The stream!
You kept the map, but you couldn't grab a little more food?
Even those mountains.
You said so yourself:
It could be possible.
And it is!
It really is... the map to El Dorado!
[Panting]
-You drank seawater, didn't you?
-Oh, come on!
I'm not coming on!
I wouldn't set foot in that jungle for a million pesetas!
-How about a hundred million?
-What?
I just thought that, after all, since El Dorado is the city of gold--
-What's your point?
-You know, dust, nuggets, bricks, a temple of gold where you can pluck gold from the very walls.
But you don't want to go, so let's... get back into the boat and row back to Spain.
-After all, it worked so well last time.
-[Gibberish] Wait!
Mmm. Wait a minute.
New plan.
We find the city of gold.
We take the gold,
-and then we go back to Spain.
-And buy Spain!
-Yeah!
-That's the spirit!
-Come on, Tulio.
We'll follow that trail!
-What trail?
The trail that we blaze!
[Nickers]
That trail that we blaze!
-[Mutters]
-[Whinnies]
Oh, no, you don't.
Yeow! Your horse bit me in the butt!
-[Chittering]
-[Hissing]
Look out new world
Here we come
-Brave, intrepid
-Charge!
And then some
Pioneers of maximum audacity
Whose résumés show that we are just the team
-To live where others merely dream
-What are you looking at?
-Building up our head of steam
-Whoa!
On the trail we blaze
[Chorus Vocalizing]
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Chorus] On the trail
On the trail we blaze
-Dinner is served.
-Hello.
Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la
The promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold a child
On the trail we blaze
[Chorus Vocalizing]
[Chorus]
On the trail we blaze
The trail we blaze
Is road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be fainthearted
We are part of a sumptuous grand design
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
[Creaking, Crackling]
-On the trail we blaze
-[Yelling]
[Yelling Continues]
[All Grunting]
[Groaning]
Hmm.
-[Snaps Fingers]
Miguel. Miguel, wake up.
-[Moans]
-We're there. Oh, yeah. We found it.
-We found it? Oh!
Fantastic!
Where is it? How far?
-Right here! Here.
-Where? Behind the rock?
-No, no. This is it.
-[Stammering]
Give me that!
This ca-What?
-Apparently, "El Dorado" is native for...
-[Muttering]
"great, big... rock"!
[Echoing]
Hey, but I tell you what, I'm feeling generous, so you can have my share!
You don't think Cortes could've gotten here before us and--
And what?
Taken all the really big rocks?
-The scoundrel!
-Tulio, you--
We have to think about this.
We've come all this way,
-and we-we-we should really, you know--
-Get... on... the horse!
[Sighs]
No, no, no, not with the face.
Stop.
[Clears Throat] Looks like there's a pass right over there.
[Panting] Ohh!
[Panting Continues]
-[Grunting, Gasps]
-[Whinnying]
-[Men Shouting]
-[Both Gasping]
-[Both] Hyah!
-[Whinnying]
-[All Gasping]
-[Snorting]
[Gasping, Grunting]
[Chuckles] I've--
Uh, hello. Is this your rock?
Sorry. We were just looking.
We're, uh--
We're tourists!
Tourist.
-[Clears Throat]
-We-We lost our group. May we go now?
-[Gasps]
-[Chuckles] Spears.
[Grunts]
[Nickers]
[Chittering]
Hey! Hey!
-[Chittering]
-[Bird Calling]
[Bird Calling Continues]
[Sighs Dejectedly]
[Whistling]
[Gasps]
[Gasps]
Oh, my--
[Miguel]
It's-It's--[Gasps]
[Both Whispering]
El Dorado.
-[Giggling]
-Oh!
[Chittering]
-[Chuckling]
-[Children Giggling]
[Whispering]
[Chanting]
[Whispering]
Mmm. Ah!
[Chattering]
[Sighs] Well, it was nice working with you, partner.
Tulio, I just want you to know...
I'm sorry about that girl in Barcelona.
-So-You-You, f--
-[Man]Behold!
As the prophesies foretold, the time of judgment is now!
[Both Gasping]
Citizens, did I not predict that the gods would come to us?
Hmm.
[Chuckling]
My lords, I am Tzekel-Kan, your devoted high priest and speaker for the gods.
Hey.
I am Chief Tannabok.
What names may we call you?
-Huh? I am Miguel.
-[Murmuring]
-And I am Tulio.
-[Murmuring Continues]
And they call us Miguel and Tulio!
[Tzekel-Kan] Your arrival has been greatly anticipated.
My lords, how long will you be staying in El Dorado?
-[Whimpering]
-Aha! I see you've captured this temple-robbing thief.
-How would you have us punish her?
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
My lord, I am not a thief.
See, the gods sent me a vision... to bring them tribute from the temple to guide them here.
My only wish is to serve the gods.
-Release her, don't ya think?
-[Villagers Gasp]
-[Grunts]
-Then you will begin by returning this... to its rightful place.
[Chittering]
-My lords, why now do you choose to visit us?
-[Scoffs]
Enough!
You do not question... the gods!
That's right!
Do not question us, or we shall have to unleash our awesome and terrible power!
And you don't want that!
-Well, yes! We do!
-You do?
Of course we do!
Visit your wrath upon this nonbeliever!
Show us the truth of your divinity!
-Divinity! One moment.
-[Chuckles]
Miguel, you know that little voice people have... that tells them to quit when they're ahead?
-You don't have one!
-Well, I'm sorry. I got carried away!
-Way away!
-Maybe we should tell the truth and beg for mercy.
Are you nuts?
We'd be butchered alive!
Yes, but they're getting suspicious.
-And if we don't come up with so me mega-cosmic event--
-[Rumbling]
-[Altivo Whinnying]
-[Chittering]
I'm trying! I'm trying! I can't think with all these distractions!
-You-Horse--
-Think horse. Think, think, think.
I'm on the verge of--
Stop! [Echoing]
[Coughing Sound]
-[Gasps]
-[Gasps]
[Crickets Chirping]
[Villagers Chanting]
-[Chanting Continues]
-Don't make me start it up again,
'cause I will.
[Chanting Continues]
O mighty lords!
Come.
Let me show you to your temple.
All right!
Temple.
Step aside.
[Villagers Murmuring]
[Panting]
[Grunting]
[Panting Continues]
[Sputters]
To commemorate your arrival,
I propose a reverent ceremony at dawn.
Ah, then perhaps I could prepare a glorious feast for you tonight.
Which would you prefer?
-Both.
-Both.
-[Together] Both.
Both is good.
-My lords.
-My lords.
And so dawns the Age of the Jaguar.
Happy New Year.
[Chuckles]
-Hey!
-Hey. Hey.
-[Laughing]
-[Laughing]
[Whinnying]
Tulio. Tulio.
They actually think we're gods.
-[Tulio]
It's an entire city of suckers.
-[Miguel Laughing]
We just have to keep this up long enough... to load up on the gold and then get the hell out of here!
Tulio, we'll be living like kings!
-Miguel and Tulio!
-Tulio and Miguel!
-Mighty and powerful gods.
-Gods.
-Hello.
-[Both Gasping, Whimpering]
-[Laughing]
-Depart, mortal,
-before we strike you with a lightning bolt.
-Mmm. Mmmm!
[Humming]
Beware the wrath of the gods! Begone!
[Clicking Sound]
Save it for the high priest, honey.
You're gonna need it.
-[Clicking Sound]
-Miguel, it's not working.
-[Clicking Sound]
-Miguel! We've been caught.
Oh, no.
Don't worry about me, boys.
"My only wish is to serve the gods."
Remember?
-How?
-Well, if you guys want the gold, then you don't want to get caught, right?
-You're going to need my help.
-[Scoffs] What makes you think we need your help?
-"Ck-ck." Are you serious?
-[Whinnies]
I-What-We--
Okay. So, uh, who are you?
-Yeah, uh, what's your angle?
-[Laughs] No angle.
-I want in.
-In?
-On the scam.
-[Chuckles]
There's no scam!
Why would you think there's a--
-Why?
-So I can get out.
I thought she just said she wanted in?
She wants in so she can get out.
Aha! Got it.
[Chuckles]
-W-Why?
-Think you're the only ones who dream of better things?
Of adventure?
You've got your reasons, and I've got mine.
Let's not make it personal, okay?
-It's just business.
-[Both] Oh.
So when you guys are ready to go back to... wherever you came from,
-I'm going with you.
-[Laughs]
No!
Don't think so.
[Coughs]
-[Whistling]
-All right. Fine.
After all, I'm sure you know... the proper rituals for blessing a tribute, the holiest days on the calendar--
Oh, and of course you know all about Xibalba.
[Chuckles]
Okay? Good luck.
-See you at the execution.
-[Gibberish]
Wait! Ho--
Would you-Hold it.
-[Chuckles] Deal?
-Hmm.
-Deal.
-Not yet.
Let's just see how this works out.
Uh-huh. Well, then I suppose that means you'll want these back?
-How'd you get those?
-Where was she keeping them?
-Call me, Chel, your new partner.
-Uh,
-that's partner-in-training.
-[Humming]
Now, put these on.
Your public's waiting.
[Continues]
-[Chel Giggling]
-Do you mind?
No.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Giggles]
Right. Uh, excuse me.
-[Grunting]
-Bye.
Mm-mm-mmm! Maybe they should call this place "Chel Dorado."
[Chuckles]
She's whoo--
-Whoa, she's trouble! Wait a minute!
-What?
The little voice--
Remember the little voice?
Ju-Ju-Just for a second imagine that you have one.
What would it be saying about Chel?
-[Purrs]
-No. No. Listen.
-We are partners.
-We are partners.
-We have a plan, remember?
-Get the gold. Go back to Spain.
Yes! And we are pretending to be gods.
Now, put Chel in the mix.
What is the voice saying?
-Listen carefully.
-[Gasps]
-Chel is off-limits, hmm?
-Bravo! Chel is off-limits!
Shake on it.
-Off-limits. Mm. Mm.
-[Both] Mmmm.
Besides, we're supposed to be gods.
We must avoid giving in to temptation.
-Gods. Oh. This is gonna be tougher than I thought.
-Tulio, relax!
All you have to do is smile, act godly and follow my lead.
[Gasps]
[Gasps] Big smile.
Like you mean it.
A-one, two, three.
I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
-[Groaning]
-Tulio, what are you talking about?
There again they're on their knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
Which rather suits us in
-The interim
-Interim, interim
It's me and him
Oh, my God!
It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a rather touching notion
All those prayers and those salaams
And who am I to bridle
If I'm forced to be an idol
If they say that I'm a god
That's what I am
What's more if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes
I can see us being sacrificed
-Or stuffed
-You have a point there.
Very good thinking.
-So let's be gods
The perks are great
-Yeah!
-El Dorado on our plates
-Thank you.
Local feelings should not
-Be rebuffed
-Never rebuffed
I never rebuff a local feeling
No, my friend
It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings
Yeah, keep 'em sweet
-That's our advice
-It's great advice!
Be a symbol of perfection
Be a legend
Be a cult
Take their praise
Take a collection
As the multitudes exalt
Don a supernatural habit
-We'd be crazy not to grab it
-You got it!
So sign on two new gods
For paradise
Par-a-dise

-[Chattering, Laughing]

[Fades, Ends]
[Both Snoring, Mumbling]
-[Metallic Clattering]
-[Both Gasping]
Good morning, my lords!
-He's back!
-Oh, no.
And now it's my turn!
-The gods have awakened!
-[Cheering]
Whoa!
[Groans]
Mm-hmm.
-[Grunts]
-[Whimpering]
-Hey, Chel, what's going on?
-It's not gonna be good.
Thank you.
This city has been granted a great blessing.
And what have we done to show our gratitude?
A meager celebration.
-The gods deserve a proper tribute!
-[Crowd Gasping]
-Hmm.
-Hmm.
The beginning of a new era, the dawning of a new age... demands... sacrifice!
-[All Gasping]
-[Gasps]
-I don't like this.
-Tulio, we've got to do something.
[Groans]
-[Groaning]
-[Yells]
[Tulio]Stop!
Hmm?
-This is not a proper tribute!
-[Moaning]
-[Crowd Gasps]
-You do not want the tribute?
No. No, no.
W-We want tribute.
Uh, it's just that, uh--
Tulio, tell him.
The stars are not in position for this tribute!
Like he says, the stars--
Can't do it.
Not today.
Ah.
Perhaps it is possible
I misread... the heavens.
-Don't worry about it.
To err is human, to forgive--
-Hmm.
My lords, may the people of El Dorado offer you our tribute.
[Crowd Gasping]
[Gasps]
[Gasping Continues]
My lords, does this please you?
-[Sighs]
-Yes, very nice.
-Certainly acceptable.
-Yes, lovely. It'll do.
The gods have chosen!
To Xibalba?
-[Crowd Murmuring]
-No. No.
[Together] To Xibalba!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-Oh, great.
[Cheering Continues]
Hey, Chel, um, what are they doing?
They're sending it to Xibalba, the spirit world.
-The spirit world.
-I'll take care of it.
[Clears Throat]
Um, excuse me, Chief.
The gods have changed their minds about Xibalba.
They wish to bask in the reverence that has been shown them.
Stop!
-[Crowd Murmuring]
-They wish to bask!
Take the tribute to the gods' temple!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Humming]
Nice going.
[Chuckles]
Smile while you can.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
[Evil Chuckle]
-[Tulio]Ai-ai-ai.
-Tons of gold for you, hah
-And tons of gold for me, hoo
-[Together]
Tons of gold for we, ah
-Not bad for a day's work, eh?
-Not bad at all.
We just became richer than the king of Spain. [Laughing]
You know, speaking of kings, the chief and high priest seem a bit, uh, tense.
Buenos días!
Listen, all we have to do... is keep playing the one against the other.
You know, do a little god dance, chant some mystic mumbo jumbo, dazzle 'em with some smoke and mirrors and then get the hell back to Spain.
Um, Tulio, how are we gonna get all this back to Spain?
Ummm--
-A boat?
-[Tulio] Yeah.
Um, we really hate to be ascending so soon, but, uh, some urgent business has come up--
-family matters-and it's just a bit--
-Yeah, family.
Badda-bing, budda-boom, you know what I mean.
Oh, we expected you to be staying with us... for the next... thousand years.
Well, as we say in the spirit world,
-there's your plan and then... there's the gods' plan.
-Mm-hmm.
And our plan, uh, calls for a boat,
'cause we're gonna ascend...
-kind of in a horizontal pattern at first.
-[Chuckles]
And then we're gonna go vertical, uh, as we get further out to sea.
Hmm. To build a boat large and glorious enough... would take... about a week.
-A week? Hmm.
-Um--
I wonder how long it would take
Tzekel-Kan to do it.
But-But for the gods, uh, three days.
Uh--
Well, if that's the best you can do.
Oh, perhaps if you were not burdened with so much tribute, you could leave sooner.
-Hmm?
-Hmm? I like it here. Miguel?
Yep, yep.
Three days is just fine.
-[Tulio]No, three days is not fine.
-[Chel Humming]
-This is a real--
-Mmm.
-these-these are the ones-problem.
-Oh. Thank you.
-Miguel, how are we gonna keep this up for three days?
-[Yawns]
You worry too much.
No, I worry exactly the right amount.
You can never worry too much.
We just have to lie low.
But, Tulio, this place is amazing!
I mean, I wonder what's--
No! Don't even move!
-Tulio--
-You're moving!
-A little, but-Come on.
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-[Stammering] Stay!
-I gotta-I--
-[Groans]Just... stand there!
-I just--
For three days?
-[Clatter]
-Yes! Exactly.
For three days.
Don't even breathe. All right?
All right.
We lie low.
No, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Promise?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.
Great! Good. Okay.
-Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to gloat over my gold.
-[Giggling]
[Kissing]
Oh, yum, yum, yum.
[Kissing Continues]
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah!
-You know, you really shouldn't miss it.
-I know.
But I-I couldn't.
Go ahead.
I'll cover for you.
-Oh, good. Thanks.
-[Tulio Singing, Indistinct]
-So, what happened to Altivo?
-I don't know.
Tulio goes for paradise
-Hey, what happened to Miguel?
-I don't know.
Oh, my God! He's gone!
Miguel's gone!
He's loose!
What am I gonna do?
Oh, no, no!
[Sobbing]
Oh, Miguel is right.
You worry too much.
[Groaning]
Oh. Ooh.
[Moans]
-Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, down, down, down.
-[Humming]
-No! No! Big trouble.
-[Gasps]
[Chuckling] Whoa!
Look, sweetheart, we're in the middle of a con here, walking the razor's edge.
On the one hand, gold!
On the other hand, painful, agonizing failure!
[Clears Throat] I can't afford any tempta-uh, distractions.
So, I'm sorry.
So sorry.
[Sharp Inhale] But perhaps another time? Another place, hmm?
[Chuckles]
Too bad. I'm free now.
I'm... not really sure
I trust you.
Mmm, I'm not really asking you to trust me.
-Am I?
-Whoo.
'Kay.
[Moans]
Ooh, yeah.
[Chirping]
Excuse me.
Excuse me?
Hey, where is everybody?
They've been cleared from the streets, my lord, so the city can be cleansed, as you ordered.
-Cleansed?
-Yes.
So the Age of the Jaguar can begin,
-as you ordered, my lord.
-[Man]Get back in!
-Where are you going?
-Hey, stop that!
-[Guard]Move!
-Hey, stop that!
What are you doing?
Stop that!
But, my lord, anyone who disobeys your orders... must be punished, as you ordered.
It seems I've been giving a lot of orders, haven't I?
Tzekel-Kan has made your commands clear, my lord.
Really?
-Here's an order: Take the day off.
-Huh?
-Are you all right?
-[Panting]
-Here.
-[Whimpers]
Oh, no!
It's all right. Please.
[Random Notes]
[Tuning]
[Continues]
-[Whinnies]
-Hey, Altivo. There you are.
-[Gasps]
-[Strums]
[Playing A Tune]
-Oh.
-Oh.
[Both Chuckling]
[Murmuring]
[Continues]
The more I learn
The more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart
The roving eye
Have come to rest
Do not apply
The frantic chase
The crazy ride
The thrill has gone
I step aside
I'd believe
In anything
Were it not for you
Showing me by just existing
Only this is true
I love you
I love you
Without question
I love you
I'd believe in anything
Were it not for you
Showing me by just existing
Only this is true
Oh, I love you
[Chuckles]
[All Chuckling]
[Whinnies]
Hmm. This is not what I expected.
Perhaps Lord Tulio will enlighten me.
[Chuckling]
How do I look?
Oh, uh-Well, you--
Oh, shut up.
-[Tulio Gasps]Oh! Whoa!
-[Chel Humming]
-[Tzekel-Kan]My lord?
-[Gasps]
-Hello?
-The high priest.
-Ow!
[Gasps] What's he gonna think if he finds one of the gods like this with me?
Uh, lucky god?
J-Just-Just-Just--
[Groans]
-Hello?
-Whoa!
Oh, Tzekel-Kan!
-What brings you here?
-I-I-I-I-I humbly request an audience with you, my lord.
-Yes, what can I do for you?
-My lord, I have just seen
Lord Miguel out among the people.
-Really?
-If I may be so bold as to offer some advice.
-All right. Shoot.
-[Clears Throat]
My lord, you are perfect.
[Chuckles]
Oh, well. Go on.
But in your perfection, you cannot know how imperfect humans are.
-Like snakes they are.
Spineless and slippery.
-[Hissing]
They are as untrustworthy as rats, stealing and cheating with no remorse.
Spinning webs of lies, like spiders!
Stop it!
That's disgusting.
They're beyond disgusting!
-Yeah, yeah, way beyond.
-Then we're in agreement.
I'll begin the necessary preparations immediately.
Do you wish to have your victims bound to an altar, or would you prefer them free-range?
-[Mutters]
-And will you be devouring their essence whole... or piece by piece?
Tzekel, you've lost me.
My lord, these people will not respect you if they do not fear you.
And, of course, we'll make them fear us by--
A sacrifice, as it is prophesied
-The history of the Age of the Jaguar will be written in--
-Ink?
-Blood!
-Blood! Oh, right.
Of course. I should probably consult with Lord Miguel.
This is fairly important stuff.
I, um, should discuss the entire, uh, blood issue right away.
Excuse us, won't you?
Let's go.
[Chuckles]
Finally... we're connecting.
[Horse Whinnies]
[Nickering]
This way.
-[Chief Laughing]
-[Chuckling, Panting]
[Grunts]
-What do you think you're doing?
-[Chuckles] Lying low.
[Grunts]
Look, change of plans.
-We have to grab what we can carry and get out of here now!
-What? Why?
Because the high priest is nuts!
He wants--
-This is unacceptable!
-Yeah. Yeah. Like he said.
The gods should not be playing ball like this!
-Well, exactly!
-This is how the gods should play ball!
-[Cheering]
-[Horn Sounding]
-Well, don't blame me.
-I blame you.
What is the object of this game, pray tell?
You've gotta knock the ball through the hoop.
-What hoop?
-That hoop.
-[Cheering Continues]
-That's impossible.
-We're gonna lose.
-Gods don't lose.
[Rumbling]
[Men] Heep-ha!
My lords, Chief Tannabok's warriors are the finest ballplayers in the city.
-[Grunting, Gargling]
-Fifteen mere mortals against two gods.
[Both Gulp]
-I realize it's a bit uneven,
-[Warriors] Heep-ha! but I do hope they'll challenge you enough to make the game... interesting.
-Play ball!
-[Crowd Cheering]
Crush them into the dust.
[Chuckles]
-Enjoy.
-[Crowd Chanting]Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
-[Rumbling]
-[Chanting, Cheering Continue]
-[Yells]
-[Gasps]
-D'oh. D'oh.
-[Murmuring]
[All Grunting]
My lords, were you not supposed to put the ball into play?
Ohh!
[Chuckles]
Well, no, no, no, no, no--
We were merely demonstrating the, um, traditional, uh, first avoidance maneuver.
Ah.
I've never heard of such a thing.
Excuse me.
Who invented this game?
-Why, the gods, [Chuckles] of course.
-[Chuckles]
I'm warning you, don't push your luck with this guy.
But, Tulio, we're the gods.
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Grunts]
Tulio!
The hip! The hip!
[Groans]
-[Panting] This is impossible.
-[Grunts]
-[Cheering]
-[Groaning]
-[Horn Sounds]
-Excuse me?
-Heep--
-Haaa!
Heep-ha! Heep-ha!
Heep-ha! Heep-ha!
[Both Groan]
-[Warriors Chanting]
-[Footsteps Rumbling]
[Chel]
Foul! That was a foul!
[Chanting Continues]
-[Squeaks]
-[Gasps]
[Warrior]
New ball!
[Both Panting]
How long does this go on anyway?
The game is over when the shadow touches this line.
-We need a miracle.
-No, we need to cheat.
-[Warriors Shouting]
-[Crowd Cheering]
[Chittering]
-[Both] Yes!
-[Horn Sounding]
-[Both] Huh?
-[All Grunting]
Hey!
-[Laughing]
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Both] Olé!
-[Crowd Chanting, Indistinct]
-[All] Huh?
-[Women Cheering]
-Hmm.
Yes! [Laughs]
-Who's the god?
-You de god.
-No, you the god. Fine.
-No, you de god.
[Giggling]
Y-Yeah! Yeah!
[Coughs]
Guys, it's here!
It's right here with me!
-[Both Gasp]
-[Altivo Whinnies]
[Gasping]
-[All Gasping]
-[Chittering]
Mmm.
[Cheering]
-[Horn Sounding]
-I love this game! [Laughing]
-[Both] Yes!
-[Laughing]
-[Laughing]
-Well done, partner.
-Yes! Yes!
-My lords, congratulations on your victory.
And now, you will, of course, wish to have the losing team...
-sacrificed to your glory.
-[Crowd Gasping]
[Groaning]
Not again.
-Look, Tzekel-Kan,
-Uh, Miguel?
-forget the sacrifices.
-Miguel.
We don't want any sacrifices.
But all of the sacred writings say that you will devour the wicked and the unrighteous.
Well, I don't see anyone here who fits that description.
[Scoffs]
Well, as speaker for the gods, it would be my privilege to point them out.
The gods are speaking for themselves now!
This city and these people... have no need for you anymore!
[Grunts]
There will be no sacrifices!
-Not now, not ever!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-Get out!
-[Gasps]
-[Scoffs]
-[Cheering Continues]
[Gasps]
[Low Growl]
Mmm. As the... gods... command.
-[Laughing]
-[Crowd Cheering]
Whoa! Who-o-oa!
Hey, not bad for my first commandment, huh? [Laughs]
Miguel, the little voice--
[Stammers]
Yeah, fine.
Do you know why the gods demand blood?
-I don't know.
-[Grunts]
Because gods don't bleed.
It's time to take the future into my own hands, and this city will be cleansed.
Even if I have to do it myself.
-Uh, how?
-[Grunts]
There are dark magics here... and power... and--
Ooh. My, my, my, my, my.
It's not called the Age of the Jaguar for nothing.
[Snickering]
This'll be a delightful way to bid the false gods... good-bye.
[Workers Shouting]
Hmm.
-Adios, muchacho!
-[Chuckles]
-[Chuckles, Gasps]
-[Birds Chirping]
[Pleasurable Moan]
[Workers Shouting]
-Well, it's, um, uh, nice.
-Nice?
-Yes, nice.
-But?
Um, but, uh, is it really fit for the gods?
-My lord.
-[Chuckles]
I have been around boats, believe me, and that, um-- the pointy, tall, um-- the-the-the-the long up and down thing--
-The mast?
-The mast, yes, yes. The mast is good.
Well, look at it. [Stammering]
There's not nearly enough, uh, um, rope.
-Rope?
-Yes, rope. Exactly my point.
Vertical ascension requires a lot more, uh, rope.
-My lord. [Chuckles]
-And look at this. [Grunting]
[Sighs, Clears Throat]
This doesn't look at all secure.
Chief, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but all in all, it is a complete do-over.
Hmm.
You know, Lord Miguel, if you wish to stay, you only need to say so.
-You mean... forever?
-Of course.
Oh, no, I can't.
I have to go back with Tulio.
We're-We're partners.
Big plans in the other world, huh?
Yep. Big plans.
Well, then,
I better go get some more rope, huh?
Oh, Chief, um, forget about the rope.
Um, my mistake.
Hey, to err is human.
-[Tulio]Half?.
-Mm-hmm.
[Laughing]
I don't think so.
I-I'll tell you what. Uh, I'll let you come back to Spain with us, like you wanted, and, um, yeah,
I can see my way clear to throwing you, mmm, ten percent?
[Chuckles] You know, maybe I won't go to Spain with you and take a third.
Ohh! [Chuckling]
Like you don't wanna go to Spain.
Oh, like you don't want me to want to go to Spain.
-I want you to want... what you want.
-Mm-hmm?
Mm-hmm. Go on.
All right.
Cards on the table.
Uh, I want you to come to Spain with me and Miguel.
Mostly me.
Especially me.
Only me.
Forget Miguel.
[Chuckles] Well, as long as that's what you want.
-Me too.
-Okay.
Deal?
-Deal. Mmm.
-[Plate Clattering]
[Hoof beats]
[Gasps]
"Forget Miguel"?
[Sniffling]
Well, forget Tulio.
[Nickering]
[Humming]
Well, is it ready yet?
Ooh.
Ah! [Sniffing]
Ahh! Hmm.
-It seems to be missing something.
-[Humming]
Ah, that's it.
-It needs more... body.
-[Grunts]
[Gasping]
[Hysterical Laughter]
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
[Grunting]
-[Growling]
-Do... as I command!
-[Tzekel-Kan Laughing]
-[Jaguar Laughing]
-The gods deserve a proper tribute.
-[Chittering]
-Stop! There will be no sacrifices!
-[Laughing]
[Chuckling]
That kid does you better than you do.
[Sighs]
Some send-off, huh?
We're finally at the "go back to Spain and live like kings" part.
[Children Laughing]
[Nickers]
Ooh-hoo-hoo.
Well, isn't king kind of a step down from god?
What? Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Miguel, we can't stay here.
[Chuckling]
We have a plan, remember?
How about... we forget the plan?
Hmm?
-What?
-[Jaguar Roaring]
[Roaring Continues]
[Both Screaming]
[Evil Laughter]
Now everyone will know the truth of your divinity.
[Shouts]
[Screams]
[Screaming Continues]
I'm okay!
I'm still okay!
Come on! Get on!
[Whinnying]

[Whinnying]
-[Roars]
-[Both Yelling]
Duck!

[Panting, Yelling]
Who-o-o-oa!
[Both Gasping, Yelling]
Move! Move!
-Jump!
-[Roaring]
[Both Yelling]
[Both]
Who-o-o-a!
I know what you are, and I know what you are not!
And you are not gods!
Y-You're not a god?
You lied to me?
[Clears Throat]
-How dare you!
-Hey, it was his stupid plan!
-What?
-Oh, oh, oh.
My plan was that we should lie low!
But your plan was to run off and be all
"Oh, look at me. Look at me. I'm a god."
-That's not true!
-No? Who are you kidding?
You're buying your own con!
At least I'm not dating mine.
I-Ooh, low blow.
Listen, Mr. High and Mighty, we'd both be sailing out of here with a mountain of gold...
-if you had just listened to me!
-[Grunts]
Well, now you've got all the precious gold and Chel.
So what do you need me for?
Well, maybe I don't need you anymore.
Well, then, why don't you just go back to Spain, and I'll stay here, and we'll both get what we want!
-That's... fine with me, pal!
-Fine with me too!
-Ooh.
-Fine!
-Ouch.
-Okay!
-[Evil Chuckling]
-[Both] All right!
Tie him up!
-[Roaring]
-What?
-[Jaguar Roaring]
-Whoa.
-[Roaring Continues]
-[Both Gasp]

That was good, huh?

[Cheering]
-[Cheering Continues]
-Hey, a little help, please?
Chief Tanni! Chief Tanni!
-I've decided to stay.
-Oh, this is wonderful news.
What a glorious day for El Dorado.
Lord Miguel has decided to live among us!
Tulio!
-Is everything okay?
-[Cheering Continues]
Everything is... fine.
[Wind Howling]
There isn't much
I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'll always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
-Beckoning the great divide
-[Grunts]
Ask no questions
Take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
All I know is all we had
Is over
Said and done
Friends never say good-bye
[Chorus]Friends
Never say good-bye
[Chattering]
Ha!
[Villagers Laughing]
Ahhh! Whew!
-Mmm.
-Friends never say good-bye
-[Children Giggling]
-[Man] Take care.
-[Child] We'll miss you!
-Thank you.
-Never say good-bye
-[Nickers]
[Groans]
-[Groans]

Never say good-bye
Well, good luck.
Yeah. You too.
Never
Say good-bye

-Whoa.
-Whoa, boy, what is it?
-[Loud Nickering]
[Man Shouting]
-[Explosions]
-[Chattering]
-Cortes.
-My lord, what is it?
Chief Tanni!
Chief Tanni!
-Approaching the city... is an army of strangers.
-[Weapons Firing]
We are safe here.
They'll never find the gate to the city.
But, sire, they are being led by Tzekel-Kan.
He survived!
Warriors, prepare yourselves for battle!
[All Shouting]
Chief, you cannot fight them!
Then how can we stop them?
We can't.
-Hmm.
-[Firing Continues]
Uh, one moment, please.
-Okay, here's the gate. Here's the boat.
-Uh-huh. And?
-Here's the gate. Here's the boat.
-Okay.
-Got that. And? Tulio!
-Well, here's the "goat," and here's the "bate."
[Shouts]
-[Chittering]
-[Gasps] That's it.
We'll crash the boat into the pillars.
That's it? I mean--
But-[Scoffs]
-What about the gold?
-Well-[Sobbing]
[Whiny Voice] Chief!.
[Clears Throat]
[Normal Voice] Chief.
I've got a plan.
[Villagers Shouting]
Hold the line steady!
They're almost in place!
[Whinnying]
It better be there, for your sake.
[Sighs]
Okay, Chief, on my signal!
Ready! Hit the pillars!
-Now!
-[Shouting Continues]
-[Rumbling]
-[Gasps]
[Weapons Firing]
-They're breaking too fast!
-Tulio, the sail!
[Grunting]
[Grunting Continues]
It's stuck!
[All Grunting]
-[Both Shout]
-[Gasps]
They're not gonna make it. Altivo!
[Nickering]
-[Whinnying]
-[Shouts]
-[Whinnies]
-Are you crazy?
[Yelling]
Get off the boat, Miguel, or you'll never see the city again.
I know. You don't think I'm gonna let you have all the fun, do you?
Come on.
We've got a wave to catch.
-[Yelling]
-[Whimpers]
-Get out of the way!
-Huh?
Hold on!
-Whoa!
-[Whinnies]
We're gonna have to hit it broadside!
That's your plan?
But the gold!
-I know!
-[Gasps]
Just turn the boat!
On impact, everybody jump!
[Gasping, Groaning]
[Coughing]
[Panting]
We made it.
It worked.
[Chuckling] It worked.
-Wait. Get down!
-Ouch. Ow.
-There they are.
-[Men Shouting]
[Gasps]
No.
You lying heathen.
There's nothing here at all.
No. Wait. Wait.
[Grunts, Gasps]
-Men, seize him!
-What?
There is no El Dorado here.
Onward, men.
[Groans]
-[Gasps]
-[Chittering]
Wait! No, wait!
Wait!
[Echoing]
-[Sputters]
-[All Laughing]
-Yes!
-Now, that was an adventure.
Yes. Yes, it was.
And, um,
-[Sobbing] it was so much gold!
-[Chuckling]
-I'm fine.
-Good.
-Let's go.
-[Sighs]
Partner.
Partner.
Hey, guys, come on!
You don't wanna stay here forever, do you?
-But... we don't have a map.
-We don't have a plan.
Well, that's what makes it interesting.
You're right!
What are we waiting for?
Let's follow that trail!
-[Whinnying] Hyah!
-[Groaning]
-Oh, the sweet unfolding
-Come on, boys!
-Of an antique mystery
-Hey, Altivo!
-All will be revealed
-Sit, boy! Sit!
-Chel, we're not on the horse!
-[Chel Laughing]
On the trail we blaze
[Chittering]
[Snorting]
[Twittering] Uh-Uhh.
Eh! [Crunch]
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me-e-e
Some day out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again
Someday soon
I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me-e-e
Some day out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again
Some day soon
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-Believe
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-[Vocalizing]
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-Believe
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me-e-e
Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again
Someday soon
The more I learn
The more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart
The roving eye
Have come to rest
Do not apply
The frantic chase
The crazy ride
The thrill has gone
I step aside
And I'd believe
In anything
Were it not for you
Showing me
By just existing
Only this is true
-I love you
-[Chorus Vocalizing]
-I love you
-[Vocalizing Continues]
Without question
I love you
-The more I want
-[Chorus] The more I steal
-The more I steal
-The more I hold
The more I hold
The less is real
-All worldly things
-I follow blind
-I follow blind
-In hope, not faith
In hope, not faith
Was paid in kind
The line is drawn
The change is made
I come to you
I'm not afraid
And I'd believe
In anything
Were it not for you
Showing me
By just existing
Only this is true
I love you

{408}{457}A warm handshake ortwo
{480}{525}Goodfriends always
{636}{687}A new's waiting to start
{720}{784}You must meet it|Wake up andgreet it
{792}{845}With a gaysong inyourheart
{1701}{1752}Here's an unusual expedition:
{1752}{1858}artists' musicians and writers setting|out for a trip through Latin America...
{1860}{1956}to find new personalities' music|and dances for their cartoon films.
{2343}{2427}Three days later they glided in|to Rio deJaneiro' Brazil...
{2427}{2498}then down to the Argentine'|Buenos Aires...
{2661}{2714}and out across the pampas.
{2829}{2886}At Cordoba' the party divided.
{2961}{3021}Some flew over the Andes into Chile.
{3021}{3069}The others went north|to the Inca country--
{3069}{3131}Bolivia' Peru|and Lake Titicaca...
{3162}{3222}turning away from the modern cities|to find the descendants...
{3222}{3278}of ancient Inca civilization.
{3366}{3463}Eight thousand square miles ofwater|over two miles above sea level...
{3474}{3580}Lake Titicaca has been prominent in Inca|history and folklore for generations.
{3720}{3780}Wood is scarce at this altitude...
{3780}{3858}so the fishermen's boats|are woven of balsa reeds.
{3990}{4084}There's always plenty of colour|and excitement here on market day.
{4182}{4266}These folks come from miles around|to trade their goods...
{4266}{4327}and swap some of the local gossip.
{4458}{4552}The styles run to bright-coloured|clothes and conservative hats...
{4578}{4636}and a rumble seat for the baby.
{4638}{4715}Just the kind of material|the artists were after.
{4797}{4859}Their music is strange and exotic--
{4905}{4980}melodies handed down|from their Inca ancestors.
{5181}{5250}And walking haystacks|are right in tempo.
{5340}{5429}These little syncopated burros|bear the heavy burdens here...
{5448}{5544}because the more dignified llama|will carry ust so much and no more.
{5592}{5685}When his quota is exceeded'|that haughty aristocrat of the Andes...
{5685}{5751}calmly sits down|and refuses to budge.
{5841}{5920}Yes' a llama can make you feel|awfully unimportant.
{6294}{6378}All these impressions' together with the|local colour that had been absorbed...
{6378}{6438}resulted in a little travelogue...
{6438}{6486}seeing the land of the Incas|through the eyes...
{6486}{6552}of a celebrated North American tourist.
{6654}{6742}Lake Titicaca is approximately|1 3'000 feet above sea level.
{6750}{6815}- 1 3'000 feet!|- Hmm' approximately.
{6846}{6951}At this great height' many visitors are|subect to altitude fever' or soroche.
{6954}{7035}- Is that so?|- The most common symptom is dizziness.
{7038}{7087}Dizziness? Aw' phooey!
{7329}{7400}Often followed|by palpitation of the heart.
{7425}{7484}The ears have a tendency to pop.
{7509}{7575}And a peculiar|ringing sound is heard.
{7653}{7702}Fascinating' isn't it?
{7749}{7804}The balsa, or basket boat...
{7809}{7893}is constructed entirely|of reeds tightly bound together.
{7905}{7965}It's built to withstand|the fury of the elements.
{7965}{8056}In fact' it seems to be impervious|to practically everything...
{8109}{8167}except the inquisitive tourist.
{8229}{8289}Crossing the lake|is often filled with adventure.
{8289}{8357}A strong wind|may arise very suddenly...
{8433}{8483}and then stop suddenly.
{8817}{8865}For the artist|in search of local colour...
{8865}{8937}the marketplace presents an|excellent picture ofvillage life...
{8937}{9022}as shoppers and merchants|bustle about the public square.
{9225}{9331}The precipitous terrain in this region|offers no problem to these hearty folk.
{9369}{9441}And we find the people here|divided into two classes--
{9441}{9502}those who walk against the wind...
{9513}{9573}and those who walk with the wind.
{9705}{9753}Yes' wherever the visitor|points his camera...
{9753}{9815}he finds a picture fit for framing.
{9840}{9909}The llama' or "yama"'|is an odd-looking individual...
{9909}{9966}with considerable personality.
{9981}{10053}His master' here' exercises|complete control over him...
{10053}{10103}with a home-made flute.
{11376}{11456}is quickly interpreted|by this wide-awake youngster.
{11796}{11901}The visitor never seems to be satisfied|until he tries on the native costume.
{11904}{11963}And our tourist is no exception.
{12615}{12675}The llama is obviously|not a itterbug...
{12675}{12735}but ifyou want to explore|this precipitous country...
{12735}{12808}he'll solve all your|transportation problems.
{13005}{13077}One soon becomes accustomed|to the low' fleecy clouds...
{13077}{13153}that steal like silent ghosts|across one's path.
{13230}{13317}The gentle undulating gait of the llama|adapts itselfvery nicely...
{13317}{13392}to the swaying motion|of the suspension bridge.
{13413}{13458}Suspension bridge?
{13473}{13507}Oh' no!
{13590}{13650}Far below us' we see the village.
{13686}{13727}Whoa! Whoa-oa!
{13827}{13864}The flute.
{14199}{14261}Give me that flute' ya big palooka!
{14514}{14559}Hey! Take it easy!
{14562}{14603}Whoa! Whoa-oa!
{14682}{14714}What?
{15006}{15078}The traveller should be cautioned|against any reckless behaviour...
{15078}{15126}at this high altitude.
{15126}{15179}Overexertion is dangerous.
{15186}{15261}And above all' one should|never lose one's temper.
{15261}{15312}Shut up' ya big windbag!
{15387}{15445}Get off of me!|Go on' beat it!
{15483}{15522}Doggone you.
{15867}{15927}And finally' the pottery market...
{15927}{15990}where the visitor always drops in...
{16023}{16071}seldom failing to accumulate|a large collection...
{16071}{16153}of the native handiwork'|as he bids a fond farewell...
{16164}{16232}to the land of the Incas'|Lake Titicaca.
{16356}{16416}The flight across the Andes|into Chile...
{16416}{16476}over the highest mountains in America.
{16476}{16556}Plenty to see and remember|on this spectacular trip.
{16572}{16620}Since no cameras are allowed here...
{16620}{16701}the boys have to cover this|from memory and sketches.
{16773}{16849}Impressions of Uspallata Pass|from 1 6'000 feet.
{16917}{16989}These sketches and the stories|told of the pioneer mail planes...
{16989}{17070}that first flew this route|started everyone thinking.
{17112}{17183}First a little plane|began to take shape...
{17244}{17302}with a personality all his own.
{17328}{17407}All agreed that he had|good screen possibilities...
{17412}{17484}and before the plane set down|at Santiago...
{17484}{17536}his life story had begun.
{17604}{17692}Once upon a time in a little airport|near Santiago' Chile...
{17709}{17763}there lived three aeroplanes:
{17763}{17841}the papa plane' the mama plane|and the baby plane.
{17886}{17960}The papa plane was a big'|powerful male plane.
{18066}{18137}Mama plane was|a middle-sized female plane.
{18174}{18249}And the baby plane was|a little boy plane named Pedro.
{18249}{18295}Uh' where is Pedro?
{18321}{18381}Oh' there he is. Maybe someday...
{18381}{18453}he'll grow up to be a big plane|like his father...
{18453}{18530}who carries the mail|between Chile and Argentina.
{18609}{18669}Like all fledglings'|Pedro went to ground school...
{18669}{18725}to learn the ABC's of flying.
{18777}{18851}He studied reading'|skywriting and arithmetic.
{18894}{18943}He was taught anatomy.
{18960}{19012}He also studied history--
{19029}{19077}Pedro! And geography.
{19113}{19214}And in geography' he learned the mail|route between Santiago and Mendoza.
{19221}{19289}Over the mighty Andes'|past Aconcagua...
{19317}{19388}highest mountain|in the Western Hemisphere.
{19413}{19509}One day the papa plane was laid up|with a cold in his cylinder head.
{19596}{19651}So he couldn't fly the mail.
{19656}{19716}And the mama plane|couldn't stand the altitude...
{19716}{19776}because she had high oil pressure.
{19776}{19824}So she couldn't fly the mail.
{19824}{19882}But the mail must go through...
{19920}{19954}I hope.
{19968}{20033}Calli Pedro.|ReaforFlit 2 to Mendoza.
{20064}{20140}"Now' remember' Pedro"'|the mama plane said...
{20145}{20232}"stay out of downdraught|and keep your muffler on tight."
{20256}{20304}And don't go near Aconca--
{20304}{20350}Aconca-- Aconcagua!
{20454}{20507}Flit 2 leaving forMendoza.
{20598}{20654}Allclear, Pedro.|Let "ergo.
{20730}{20799}Give "erthegun, boy!|Gun "er! Gun "er!
{20826}{20895}Don"t loseyouringspeed!|Pullup!!Pullup!!
{20922}{20958}Look out!
{21042}{21102}And so' after a masterly takeoff...
{21102}{21150}Pedro started on|his first assignment...
{21150}{21208}to pick up the mail at Mendoza.
{21258}{21350}Each and every trip through|this pass is an adventure in itself.
{21354}{21425}At this altitude'|you never can tell what--
{21426}{21465}Downdraught!
{21498}{21558}Pulled out of that one all right.
{21558}{21616}Handles himseIf like a veteran.
{21654}{21714}His course carried him|over the Pass of Uspallata...
{21714}{21786}where stands the statue|of the Christ of the Andes...
{21786}{21858}marking the boundary|between Chile and Argentina.
{21858}{21926}So far' so good.|Not a cylinder missing.
{21942}{22023}Pedro was flying on top|of the world when suddenly...
{22038}{22117}his first view of that|towering monarch' Aconcagua!
{22170}{22248}So this was the big bully|they'd warned him about.
{22257}{22305}But he didn't scare Pedro' though.
{22305}{22343}No' sirree.
{22482}{22527}Well' the worst is over.
{22527}{22602}And from now on'|it's clear sailing to Mendoza.
{22614}{22662}Come in against the wind' Pedro.
{22662}{22727}There's your mail.|Easy now. Attaboy!
{22770}{22835}He picked up his mail|like a veteran.
{22842}{22909}Uh-oh! Careful!|That cargo is precious.
{22938}{23013}Pedro was homeward-bound|and ahead of schedule.
{23046}{23123}I'll bet his mother and dad|will be proud of him.
{23130}{23183}Just a natural-born flier.
{23226}{23295}Hmm. Maybe I|shouldn't have mentioned it.
{23547}{23583}Look out!
{23595}{23643}Hope he got that out of his system.
{23643}{23704}Now with good luck and a--|Uh-oh.
{23775}{23847}I was afraid of that.|Hey' Pedro' come back!
{23889}{23988}The little fellow had completely|forgotten his responsibilities. Pedro!
{24024}{24076}Then suddenly' Aconcagua!
{24120}{24214}Its rocky' snow-filled crags formed|the face of a leering monster.
{24252}{24312}The oil froze|in little Pedro's cylinders...
{24312}{24372}and his motor knocked with fright.
{24372}{24440}All those warnings|came back to him now:
{24444}{24521}the treacherous crosscurrents'|the sudden storms.
{25449}{25505}Climb above the storm' Pedro!
{25509}{25579}Never mind the mail!|Let it go! Let it go!
{25581}{25646}Forget the mail!|Climb' Pedro! Climb!
{25716}{25752}Look out!
{25821}{25868}Climb' Pedro! Climb!
{25887}{25959}Get above the storm!|I know you can make it!
{26172}{26243}Drop the mail!|You've got to save yourself!
{26268}{26333}More altitude!|25'000's all you need!
{26367}{26401}Up! Up!
{26433}{26517}Gun your motor! Now ust a little more|and you'll be in the clear!
{26517}{26575}Climb' Pedro! Climb!|Good boy!
{26613}{26676}Good boy!|I knew you could make it!
{26688}{26736}You're all right now.
{26736}{26806}Just level off|and head straight for home.
{26844}{26887}He's out of gas.
{26928}{26968}Pedro! Pedro!
{27072}{27109}He's gone.
{27144}{27196}Back at the home field...
{27198}{27269}Pedro's parents|searched the skies in vain.
{27270}{27345}They knew that he couldn't|have held out this long.
{27345}{27405}Their brave little son was gone...
{27405}{27467}another martyr to the mail service.
{27489}{27553}Poor little fella.|His first flight.
{27573}{27637}It's too bad|it had to end this way.
{27681}{27722}What was that?
{27729}{27793}I wonder if it--|No' it couldn't be.
{27816}{27867}Wait! It is! It's Pedro!
{28038}{28102}Pedro! Petey boy!|Are you all right?
{28134}{28194}Well' don't ask me how he did it.
{28218}{28288}It wasn't exactly|a three-point landing...
{28290}{28347}but he did fulfil his mission.
{28362}{28417}He brought the mail through.
{28422}{28485}The mail'|that all-important cargo.
{28548}{28623}"Having wonderful time.|Wish you were--" Mmm.
{28647}{28695}Well' it might have been important.
{28695}{28751}And he did bring in the mail.
{28791}{28839}And so' the papa plane'|the mama plane...
{28839}{28908}and little Pedro|flew happily ever after.
{28956}{29045}Sailing eastward from Chile'|we cross the Argentine pampas...
{29076}{29149}ust millions of acres|of rich grazing land...
{29220}{29297}the third largest city|in the Western Hemisphere.
{29322}{29370}Buenos Aires is a beautiful city.
{29370}{29453}This is the plaza de Mayo,|one of its delightful parks;
{29478}{29542}the Teatro Colon,|home of the opera;
{29586}{29681}and the stately Congress building'|centre ofArgentina's government.
{29730}{29798}The tallest building|in South America...
{29802}{29852}the Edificio Cavanaugh.
{29898}{29961}Yes' they were really|impressed with the big city...
{29961}{30021}but impressive' too'|was the lure of the pampas...
{30021}{30105}and the Argentine gaucho|as painted by F. Molina Campos.
{30150}{30198}The party were guests|at his ranch studio...
{30198}{30246}where Senor Campos paints the gaucho...
{30246}{30304}with amazing detail and humour.
{30414}{30462}Seeing these pictures made them|more anxious than ever...
{30462}{30525}to meet these caballeros|in person.
{30612}{30672}And they lived up to their pictures.
{30672}{30723}A real Wild West show...
{30732}{30804}but ust part|of the day's work for a gaucho.
{30819}{30897}Sketching these paisanos|in action was no easy ob.
{31020}{31113}But they did manage to get a good|look at the gaucho's equipment.
{31116}{31187}Silver coins decorate his belt'|or tirador.
{31209}{31257}The sheepskin saddle.
{31269}{31317}Soft horsehide boots.
{31341}{31399}This garment's called a chiri .
{31482}{31553}Here the visitors|were treated to an asado.
{31557}{31630}choice cuts of meat;|mate, the Argentine tea;
{31680}{31741}and wine from their own vineyards.
{31746}{31800}True Argentine hospitality.
{31812}{31884}A group of skilled dancers|entertained the guests.
{31884}{31951}Not the modern tango|of Buenos Aires...
{31956}{32024}but the country dances|of the Argentine.
{32028}{32110}The same tunes to which|their grandparents had danced.
{32508}{32568}Notice how closely|these steps resemble...
{32568}{32640}the old-time square dances|of North America.
{32892}{32967}Gathering picture material|here was a pleasure.
{33573}{33621}Another story was under way.
{33621}{33726}And after seeing Senor Campos' paintings|and all this colourful exhibition...
{33726}{33786}we couldn't help but compare|the life of the Argentine gaucho...
{33786}{33840}with that of our own cowboy.
{33840}{33927}And they reached way back|into Texas to find a leading man.
{33927}{33990}From the windswept plains|of Montana...
{33990}{34060}to the sunbaked banks|of the Rio Grande...
{34062}{34137}over countless miles|of mountain and prairie...
{34146}{34238}untouched and unsullied by|the mercenary hand of civilization...
{34266}{34339}roams a tough'|hardy and heroic breed of man:
{34362}{34415}the North American cowboy.
{34422}{34483}Strong' silent and weather-beaten.
{34557}{34601}Howdy' strangers.
{34605}{34665}This colourful cowhand|of the great West...
{34665}{34742}has his counterpart|in the South American gaucho.
{34749}{34837}Over land and sea' over rugged|mountains and dense ungles...
{34881}{34979}down across the equator to the lush'|grassy pampas of the Argentine...
{35001}{35051}the home of the gaucho.
{35097}{35181}Now' the cowboys of both|Americas have much in common...
{35193}{35275}although their costume|differs in a few minor details.
{35277}{35353}We substitute bombachas|for chaps; the sombrero.
{35373}{35421}Then there's the saco,|the tirador...
{35421}{35474}the chiri and the panuelo.
{35625}{35685}Then' finally'|we have the poncho...
{35685}{35746}which ust about covers everything.
{35805}{35889}The gaucho's closest friend|and inseparable companion...
{35889}{35939}is his horse' or pingo.
{36057}{36105}Quickly the gaucho|reaches for his lasso!
{36105}{36189}Twirling the rawhide above his head'|he deftly tosses the noose|about the horse's neck...
{36189}{36237}and easily subdues|the spirited animal...
{36237}{36302}with the help|of the snubbing post...
{36321}{36360}or palenque.
{36393}{36464}Thanks to the palenque,|or snubbing post...
{36465}{36561}the horse is soon brought under|control and is ready for the saddle.
{36681}{36752}While it appears complex|at first glance...
{37050}{37110}adding the cinchas,|bastos, sheepskin' pigskin...
{37110}{37175}bridle' bit and' finally'|the gaucho.
{37254}{37302}When riding the range at night...
{37302}{37387}the saddle may be quickly|converted into a bed' or catre.
{37398}{37429}Bed?
{37554}{37626}One of the gaucho's|favourite sports is the asado...
{37626}{37675}or Argentine barbecue.
{37698}{37754}Over an open charcoal fire...
{37758}{37826}thick' uicy'|tender steaks are prepared.
{37842}{37913}And' amigos'|it fairly melts in your mouth.
{38061}{38133}The gaucho's method|of eating looks quite simple...
{38133}{38203}yet requires|a certain amount of practice.
{38205}{38275}The bread and meat|are held in one hand...
{38277}{38313}the knife in the other.
{38313}{38361}Note the action|ofwrist and elbow...
{38361}{38444}as knife and food synchronize|in deft' graceful rhythm.
{38481}{38534}One' two' bite' cut' chew.
{38565}{38622}One' a-two' a-bite' cut' chew.
{38661}{38721}Yes' it is this wholesome diet|that builds...
{38721}{38798}the gaucho's nerves of steel|and muscles of iron.
{38841}{38901}And now the boleadoras, or bolas.
{38913}{38997}The bolas consists of three lead|weights covered with rawhide...
{38997}{39057}and is often used for sport'|such as capturing...
{39057}{39135}that swift-moving bird of the|pampas' the Argentine ostrich...
{39135}{39175}or avestruz..
{39195}{39255}Unlike most members|of the ostrich family...
{39255}{39327}the avestruz. is not equipped|with ornamental tail plumage.
{39327}{39409}Its slender legs make|excellent targets for the bolas.
{39423}{39467}Did he say bolas?
{39543}{39627}Dashing at breakneck speed' the gaucho|whirls the bolas 'round and 'round...
{39627}{39693}faster and faster'|and then the throw!
{39879}{39958}And now to fully appreciate|this remarkable feat...
{39975}{40023}let us study the action...
{40023}{40093}through the eye|of the slow-motion camera.
{40119}{40174}Note the grace and beauty...
{40179}{40256}of this light-footed creature|in startled flight.
{40311}{40397}With delicate balance and|clocklike precision of timing...
{40419}{40476}man and beast moving as one...
{40503}{40565}display a minimum ofwaste motion...
{40623}{40686}as the whirling bolas are unleashed.
{40839}{40923}Faster and faster!|On and on they spin' closer and closer!
{40923}{40995}Here they come! Be careful!|Get out of the way! Heads up! Watch it!
{40995}{41046}Look out' look out!|Here it comes! Duck' duck' duck!
{41046}{41092}Too late! Too late!
{41298}{41341}And when night--
{41346}{41392}When night falls...
{41403}{41498}the lone gaucho oft-times finds|himseIf far' far out on the pampas.
{41526}{41603}Listen to the melancholy|strains of the triste...
{41610}{41660}a sad' romantic ballad.
{42411}{42471}But the gaucho is not always sad.
{42471}{42555}Come' let us dance to|the lively beat of the chacarera...
{42555}{42617}the dance of the farmer's daughter.
{42711}{42761}Combining the minuet...
{42771}{42837}the bunny hug|and a dash ofumping ive.
{42867}{42930}The pampas version of cutting a rug.
{42975}{43018}And EIMalambo...
{43023}{43117}a solo number in which the dancer|swings out with utter abandon...
{43131}{43213}often described as|perpetual motion below the equator.
{43539}{43612}Traditional dance|of the rooster and the hen.
{43947}{44037}And now' as he sways to|the gentle undulations of EIMalambo...
{44043}{44112}we gently waft|our transplanted cowboy...
{44139}{44187}back to his prairie homeland.
{44187}{44259}Here we leave him|with warm and tender memories...
{44259}{44340}of his visit to the gay'|romantic land of the gaucho.
{44652}{44734}And now from the pampas|to Brazil and Rio deJaneiro...
{44736}{44811}a city of amazing beauty|and a perfect setting.
{45027}{45111}One of the best views of the city|is from the top of Sugarloaf...
{45111}{45191}overlooking Copacabana Beach'|the playground of Rio.
{45255}{45318}From Corcovado' the Statue|of the Saviour looks out...
{45318}{45384}upon these scenes|of active city life.
{45438}{45520}This is the kind of atmosphere|the artists were after:
{45531}{45578}the outdoor cafes...
{45603}{45680}the mosaic sidewalks|that are found all over Rio.
{45705}{45783}These designs are a tribute|to patience and artistry...
{45783}{45843}preserving a Brazilian tradition.
{45891}{45958}Here are some|of the first impressions.
{46011}{46071}This is what can happen to a big city|when a crowd of cartoonists...
{46071}{46115}are turned loose.
{46260}{46320}Among the sketches|was a promising actor...
{46320}{46416}Old Papagaio' the parrot featured|in most of Brazil's funny stories.
{46506}{46598}With the help of the wardrobe|department' he becomesJoe Carioca.
{46626}{46682}The music of Brazil' a samba.
{46716}{46784}Rhythm instruments|like the reco reco...
{46806}{46850}and the cabaca...
{46872}{46951}all help to beat out|that intricate samba rhythm...
{46980}{47039}a lively two-step with a bounce.
{47094}{47154}It's the same rhythm that|captivates the whole city...
{47154}{47213}when carnival time comes around.
{47736}{47780}Carnival in Rio--
{47784}{47843}three hilarious days and nights.
{47844}{47904}Singing' dancing and celebrating.
{47916}{48008}The spirit of the Mardi Gras|and New Year's Eve rolled into one.
{48156}{48255}Each year hundreds of songs are written|especially for this occasion...
{48267}{48372}and the dream of every composer is to|have his song chosen as a carnival hit.
{48390}{48492}One number stood out as a perfect|background for the first Brazilian film.
{48498}{48582}Its author' Ary Barroso'|has made use of the samba rhythm...
{48582}{48656}to paint a musical picture|of his native land.
{48714}{48765}A watercolour of Brazil.
{52500}{52553}What happened? Where am I?
{52572}{52627}What's going on around here?
{52728}{52772}Boy' this is fun!
{52908}{52941}Uh-oh.
{52968}{53017}What's this? A parrot?

Life's not fair, is it?
You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.
And you shall never see the light of another day.
Adieu.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
What do you want?
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way, so you'd better have a good excuse for missing this morning's ceremony.
Oh, look, Zazu.
You've made me lose my lunch.
You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you.
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.
I quiver with fear!
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.
Help!
Scar?
Drop him.
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.
Why, if it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
That was today?
I feel simply awful!
Must've slipped my mind.
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother, you should've been first in line!
Well, I was first in line, until the little hairball was born.
That hairball is my son and your future king.
I shall practise my curtsy!
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
Oh, no, Mufasa.
Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.
Is that a challenge?
Temper, temper.
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.
Pity. Why not?
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.
But when it comes to brute strength,
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.
There's one in every family, sire.
Two in mine, actually, and they always manage to ruin special occasions.
What am I going to do with him?
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.
Zazu!
And just think, whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him.
Simba.
Dad! Dad!
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!
Sorry.
Dad! Dad!
Your son is awake.
Before sunrise, he's your son.
Dad! Come on, Dad.
You promised.
Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up.
Yeah!
Look, Simba.
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun.
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.
- And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.
Everything the light touches.
What about that shadowy place?
That's beyond our borders.
You must never go there, Simba.
But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.
Oh, there's more to being king than getting your way all the time.
- There's more?
- Simba...
Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance.
As king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.
When we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass.
And so we are all connected in the great circle of life.
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.
Checking in with the morning report.
Fire away.
Well! The buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot.
Really?
What are you doing, son?
Pouncing.
Let an old pro show you how it's done.
I told the elephants to forget it, but they can't...
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.
The cheetahs are hard up, but...
Stay low to the ground.
Cheetahs never prosper...
Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.
Very good. Pouncing.
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...
This is so humiliating.
Try not to make a sound.
What are you telling him, Mufasa?
Mufasa? Simba?
That's very good.
- Zazu!
- Yes!
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!
Zazu, take Simba home.
Aw, dad, can't I come?
No, son.
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.
Oh, young master, one day, you will be king.
Then you can chase those slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?
I despise guessing games.
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.
Oh, goody!
My dad just showed me the whole kingdom, and I'm gonna rule it all!
Yes. Well, forgive me for not leaping forjoy.
Bad back, you know.
Hey, Uncle Scar.
When I'm king, what'll that make you?
A monkey's uncle.
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.
So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?
Everything.
He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border?
Well, no. He said I can't go there.
And he's absolutely right.
It's far too dangerous.
Only the bravest lions go there.
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.
Why not?
I'm only looking out for the well-being of my favourite nephew.
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.
All the more reason for me to be protective.
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince. Oops!
An elephant what?
Oh, dear, I've said too much.
Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later, you being so clever and all.
Just do me one favour.
Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.
No problem.
There's a good lad.
You run along now and have fun.
And remember, it's our little secret.
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.
Come on. I just heard about this great place.
Simba! I'm kind of in the middle of a bath.
And it's time for yours.
Mom!
Mom, you're messing up my mane!
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?
So, where are we going?
It better not be anyplace dumb.
No, it's really cool.
So, where is this really cool place?
Oh.
- Around the water hole.
- The water hole?
What's so great about the water hole?
I'll show you when we get there.
Oh.
Mom, can I go with Simba?
What do you think, Sarabi?
Well...
Please?
It's all right with me.
- Yeah!
- All right!
As long as Zazu goes with you.
No, not Zazu.
Step lively.
The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave.
So, where are we really going?
An elephant graveyard.
Zazu.
Right. So, how are we gonna ditch the dodo?
Oh, just look at you two.
Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savanna.
Your parents will be thrilled, what with your being betrothed and all.
Be-what?
Betrothed. Intended.
Affianced.
Meaning...
One day, you two are going to be married.
- Yuck!
- Eww!
I can't marry her. She's my friend.
Yeah, it'd be so weird.
Sorry to bust your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice.
It's a tradition going back generations.
When I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.
Nice try, but only the king can do that.
Well, he's the future king.
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.
Not yet, I don't.
And with an attitude like that,
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king, indeed.
Not the way I see it.

I beg your pardon, madam, but get off!
Simba?
Nala!
All right! It worked!
- We lost him.
- I am a genius.
Hey, genius, it was my idea.
Yeah, but I pulled it off.
- With me!
- Oh, yeah?
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!
Pinned ya again.
This is it. We made it.
It's really creepy.
Yeah.
Isn't it great?
- We could get in big trouble.
- I know!
I wonder if its brains are still in there.
There's only one way to know.
Come on, let's go check it out.
Wrong! The only checking out you will do will be to check out of here.
Oh, man!
We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands.
Look, banana beak is scared.
It's Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy, and right now we are all in very real danger.
Danger?
I walk on the wild side.
I laugh in the face of danger.
Well, well, well, Banzai, what have we got here?
I don't know, Shenzi.
What do you think, Ed?
Just what I was thinking.
A trio of trespassers!
And quite by accident, let me assure you.
A simple navigational error.
Wait, wait, wait.
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.
And that would make you...
The future king.
Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom?
You can't do anything to me.
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.
But you told me they're nothing but slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.
Ix-nay on the upid-stay.
- Who are you callin' upid-stay?
- My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun!
- It's time to go!
- What's the hurry?
We'd love you to stick around for dinner.
Yeah, we could have whatever's lion around!
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!
Make mine a cub sandwich!
Whaddaya think?
What, Ed? What is it?
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?
No, why?
'Cause there it goes!
- Did we lose 'em?
- I think so.
Where's Zazu?
The little major-domo bird hippety-hopped all the way to the birdie-boiler.
Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler!
Aaaah!
Hey, why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
- Like you?
- Oops.
Boo!
Simba!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
That was it?
Do it again. Come on.
- Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle!
- Silence!
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- Calm down. We're really sorry.
If you ever come near my son again...
Oh, this is... This is your son?
- Oh, your son.
- Did you know that?
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?
- No, of course not.
- No.
Ed?
Toodles.
- Dad, I...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.
- Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
- Let's go home.
I thought you were very brave.
Zazu.
Yes, sire?
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.
Come, Nala.
Simba, good luck.
Simba!
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.
- I know.
- You could've been killed.
You deliberately disobeyed me, and what's worse, you put Nala in danger.
I was just trying to be brave, like you.
I'm only brave when I have to be.
Simba, being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
But you're not scared of anything.
I was today.
- You were?
- Yes.
I thought I might lose you.
I guess even kings get scared?
- But you know what?
- What?
I think those hyenas were even scareder.
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.
- Come here, you.
- Oh, no! No!
Come here!
Gotcha!
Dad?
- We're pals, right?
- Right.
And we'll always be together, right?
Simba, let me tell you something that my father told me.
Look at the stars.
The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars.
- Really?
- Yes.
So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you.
And so will I.
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.
It's not funny, Ed.
Hey, shut up!
Will you knock it off?
- Well, he started it.
- Look at you guys.
No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain.
Man, I hate dangling.
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint.
Man, I hate lions.
- So pushy.
- And hairy.
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...
Ugly!
Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.
- Oh.
- Oh, Scar. It's just you.
We were afraid it was somebody important.
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.
- Yeah.
- I see.
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.
I just hear that name and I shudder.
- Mufasa!
- Do it again.
- Mufasa!
- Ooooh!
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!
It tingles me.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us. I mean, you're our pal.
Charmed.
Oh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper.
Yeah. Hey, did you bring us anything to eat,
Scar, old buddy, old pal?
Did ya, did ya, did ya?
I don't think you really deserve this.
I practically gift-wrapped those cubs for you, and you couldn't even dispose of them.
Well, you know, it wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar.
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?
Kill Mufasa?
Precisely.

You wait here. Your father has a marvellous surprise for you.
What is it?
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it?
If you tell me,
I'll still act surprised.
Ho ho ho! You are such a naughty boy.
- Come on, Uncle Scar.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is just for you and your daddy.
You know, a sort of father-son thing.
Well, I'd better go get him.
- I'll go with you.
- No.
No. Just stay on this rock.
You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas.
- You know about that?
- Simba, everybody knows about that.
- Really?
- Oh, yes.
Lucky daddy was there to save you, eh?
Oh, and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours?
Oh. Okay.
Hey, Uncle Scar, will I like this surprise?
Simba, it's to die for.
Shut up.
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.
Stay put.
Can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.
There he is. Let's go.
"Little roar." Puh!
Rarr!
Rrrarr!
Rarr!
Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move.
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.
Stampede in the gorge.
- Simba's down there!
- Simba?
Zazu, help me!
Your father is on the way! Hold on!
Hurry!
There! There on that tree!
Hold on, Simba!
Dad!
Oh, Scar, this is awful!
What'll we do? What'll we do?
I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do.
Dad!
Scar!
- Brother.
- Brother, help me!
Long live the king.
No!
Dad!
Dad?
Dad, come on.
You got to get up.
Dad?
We got to go home.
Help!
Somebody!
Anybody.
Help.
Simba. What have you done?
There were wildebeests, and he tried to save me.
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
Of course. Of course you didn't.
No one ever means for these things to happen.
But the king is dead.
And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive.
Oh, what will your mother think?
What am I going to do?
Run away, Simba.
Run. Run away and never return.
Kill him.
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.
So go get him.
There ain't no way I'm going in there.
What, you want me to come out looking like you, cactus butt?
But we got to finish the job.
Well, he's as good as dead out there anyway.
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.
Yeah! You hear that?
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.
But to lose Simba, who had barely begun to live...
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.
So it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne.
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era in which lion and hyena come together in a great and glorious future.
Yaaaah!
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.
Hee hee hee! Gets 'em every time.
Hey, Timon, you better come look.
I think it's still alive.
Eeeuw.
All righty, what have we got here?
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.
Maybe he'll be on our side.
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?
You know, having a lion around might not be such a bad idea.
So we're keeping him?
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?
My point exactly.
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out of here and find some shade.
- You okay, kid?
- I guess so.
You nearly died.
I saved you.
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, where you going?
Nowhere.
Gee, he looks blue.
- I'd say brownish gold.
- No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.
Kid, what's eating you?
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.
The food chain!
So, where you from?
Who cares? I can't go back.
You're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.
- But I don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?
Not unless you can change the past.
You know, kid, in times like this, my buddy Timon here says,
"You got to put your behind in your past."
No, no, no.
- I mean...
- Amateur.
Lie down before you hurt yourself.
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?
- Right.
- Wrong!
When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world.
Well, that's not what I was taught.
Then maybe you need a new lesson.
Repeat after me.

These are rare delicacies.
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.
You'll learn to love them.
I'm telling you, kid, this is the great life, no rules, no responsibilities.

I would never have had to do this with Mufasa.
What? What did you say?
- Nothing.
- You know the law.
Never, ever mention that name in my presence. I am the king!
Yes, sire, you are the king.
I... I only mentioned it to illustrate the differences in your royal managerial approaches.
- Hey, boss.
- Oh, what is it this time?
- We got a bone to pick with you.
- I'll handle this.
Scar, there's no food, no water.
Yeah. It's dinner time and we ain't got no stinking entrées.
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.
- Yeah, but they won't go hunt.
- Oh...
- Eat Zazu.
- Oh, you wouldn't want me.
I'd be so tough and gamey and...
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.
I thought things were bad under Mufasa.
- What did you say?
- I said Muf...
I said... qué pasa?
Good. Now get out.
But we're still hungry.
Out!
- Nice one, Simba.
- Thanks.
- Man, I'm stuffed.
- Me, too.
I ate like a pig.
Pumbaa, you are a pig.
Oh. Right.
- Timon?
- Yeah?
Ever wonder what those sparkling dots are up there?
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.
Oh? What are they?
They're fireflies.
Fireflies that got stuck up in that big bluish-black thing.
Oh, gee.
I always thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away.
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.
Simba, what do you think?
Well, I don't know.
Oh, come on. Give, give, give, give.
Come on. We told you ours. Please?
Well...
Somebody once told me that the great kings of the past are up there watching over us.
Really?
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us?
Pfff!
- Who told you something like that?
- Yeah, yeah.
- What mook made that up?
- Yeah. Pretty dumb?
- Aw, you're killing me.
- Yeah.
Was it something I said?
Simba?
He's... He's alive? He's alive!
It is time.

- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

How do you...
Time out! Let me get this straight.
You know her, she knows you.
But she wants to eat him, and everybody's okay with this?
- Did I miss something?
- Relax, Timon.
Wait till everyone finds out you've been here all this time.
And your mother, what will she think?
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.
They do?
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.
He did? What else did he tell you?
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means, you're the king.
King? Lady, have you got your lions crossed!
King?
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
- Stop it.
- It's not gravel, it's grovel.
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?
- No.
- Simba!
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be, but that was a long time ago.
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?
- Look, I'm still the same guy.
- But with power.
Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?
Hey, whatever she has to say, she can say in front of us, right, Simba?
Maybe you'd better go.
It starts. You think you know a guy.
Timon and Pumbaa, you learn to love 'em.
What?
What is it?
It's like you're back from the dead.
You don't know how much this will mean to everyone.
What it means to me.

But I don't understand something.
You've been alive all this time.
Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock?
Well, I just needed to get out on my own, live my own life.
And I did, and it's great.
We've really needed you at home.
- No one needs me.
- Yes, we do. You're the king.
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.
Simba, he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands.
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.
There's no food, no water.
Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve.
- I can't go back.
- Why?
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
Hakuna matata.
- What?
- Hakuna matata.
It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...
Simba... and there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry?
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.
I left to find help, and I found you.
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.
- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?
- You're not the Simba I remember.
- You're right. I'm not.
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.
You know, you're starting to sound like my father.
Good. At least one of us does.
You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life?
You don't even know what I've been through.
I would if you'd just tell me.
- Forget it!
- Fine!
She's wrong. I can't go back.
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.
You can't change the past.
You said you'd always be there for me!
But you're not.
And it's because of me.
It's my fault.
Come on, will you cut it out?
Can't cut it out.
It'll grow right back!
Creepy little monkey.
Will you stop following me?
- Who are you?
- The question is, who are you?
I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure.
Well, I know who you are.
Come here. It's a secret.

Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused.
- You don't even know who you are.
- Oh, and I suppose you know.
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.
- Bye.
- Hey, wait!
You knew my father?
Correction, I know your father.
I hate to tell you this, but he died a long time ago.
Nope. Wrong again!
He's alive, and I'll show him to you.
You follow old Rafiki.

Stop!

That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.
No.
Look harder.
You see?
He lives in you.
Simba.
Father?
Simba, you have forgotten me.
No. How could I?
You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me.
Look inside yourself, Simba.
You are more than what you have become.
You must take your place in the circle of life.
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.
Remember who you are.
You are my son and the one true king.
Remember who you are.
No! Please, don't leave me!
Remember.
- Father!
- Remember!
Don't leave me.
Remember.
What was that?
The weather.
- Very peculiar, don't you think?
- Yeah.
Looks like the winds are changing.
Change is good.
Yeah, but it's not easy.
I know what I have to do, but going back means I'll have to face my past.
I've been running from it for so long.
Jeez! What was that for?
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.
Yeah, but it still hurts.
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.
But the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it.
You see?
So what are you going to do?
First, I'm gonna take your stick.
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm going back!
Good! Go on! Get out of here!
Whoooo! Whoooo!
Grubs! Grubs!
Hey. Hey, wake up.
It's okay! It's okay! It's me!
Don't ever do that again.
Carnivores! Oy!
- Have you guys seen Simba?
- I thought he was with you.
He was, but now I can't find him.
Where is he?
Ho ho! You won't find him here!
The king has returned.
I can't believe it. He's gone back!
Gone back? What do you mean?
Hey, what's goin' on here?
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.
- Who?
- Scar.
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No!
Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle to take his place as king.
Oh.
Simba, wait up!
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I didn't want to believe you.
What made you come back?
I finally got some sense knocked into me, and I've got the bump to prove it.
Besides, this is my kingdom.
If I don't fight for it, who will?
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.
Danger?
I laugh in the face of danger.
I see nothing funny about this.
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?
At your service, my liege.
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle for this?
Yes, Timon. This is my home.
Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper!
Well, Simba, if it's important to you, we're with you to the end.
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.
So what's your plan for getting past those guys?
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!
Come on, Timon. You guys have to create a diversion.

No, you're just not looking hard enough.

We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

Mufasa? No, you're dead.
Mufasa?
No. It's me.
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?
It doesn't matter. I'm home.
Simba?
Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised to see you alive.
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.
Oh, Simba, you must understand.
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.
Oh, well, I would, naturally.
However, there is one little problem.
You see them?
They think I'm king.
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.
The choice is yours, Scar.
Either step down or fight.
Oh, must this all end in violence?
I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.
I've put it behind me.
But what about your faithful subjects?
Have they put it behind them?
Simba, what is he talking about?
So you haven't told them your little secret.
Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them.
Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death.
I am.
It's not true.
Tell me it's not true.
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would be alive. It's your fault he's dead!
- Do you deny it?
- No.
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again, but this time daddy isn't here to save you, and now everyone knows why!
Simba!
Now, this looks familiar.
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.
Oh, yes. I remember.
This is just the way your father looked before he died.
And here's my little secret.
I killed Mufasa.
No! Murderer!
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.
Truth? But truth is in the eye of the behold...
All right.
All right.
I did it.
So they can hear you.
I killed Mufasa!
Hee-yah!
Excuse me. Pardon me.

- Let me in! Let me in!
Please, don't eat me.

- Are you talkin' to me?
- He called him a pig.
- To me?
- Shouldn't have done that.
- To me?
- Now they're in for it.
- They call me Mr Pig!
Aaaaggghhh!
Take that, you stupid...
Take that and that!
Run, you yellow-belly!
- Murderer.
- Simba. Simba, please.
- Please, have mercy. I beg you.
- You don't deserve to live.
But Simba, I am family.
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.
It was their fault. It was their idea.
Why should I believe you?
Everything you ever told me was a lie.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.
No, Scar.
I'm not like you.
Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?
Tell me. I mean, anything.
Run.
Run away, Scar, and never return.
Yes.
Of course.
As you wish, your Majesty!

Friends? I thought he said we were the enemy.
Yeah. That's what I heard.

Where the caravan camels roam

Ah, salaam and good evening to you, worthy friend.
Please, please, come closer.
Too close. A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this side of the River Jordan, on sale today. Come on down.
Look at this. Yes.
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break. Will not...
It broke.
Ohh! Look at this.
I have never seen one of these intact before.
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.
Listen. Ah, still good.
Wait. Don't go.
I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare.
I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this.
Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance.
Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts.
This is no ordinary lamp.
It once changed the course of a young man's life.
A young man who, like this lamp, was more than what he seemed.
A diamond in the rough.
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
It begins on a dark night,
where a dark man waits
with a dark purpose.
You are late.
A thousand apologies,
O patient one.
You have it, then?
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.
Ah-ah-ahhh.
The treasure.
Ow!
Trust me, my pungent friend.
- You'll get what's coming to you.
- What's coming to you. Awk!
Quickly! Follow the trail.
Faster.
At last, after all my years of searching, the Cave of Wonders.
Awk. Cave of Wonders.
By Allah.
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine.
Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp.
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?
Shh.
Who disturbs my slumber?
It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
Know this.
Only one may enter here, one whose worth lies far within.
A diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for? Go on.
No!
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp.
Just forget it. Look at this. I'm so ticked off that I'm moulting.
Patience, Iago. Patience.
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
Oh, there's a big surprise.
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise.
What are we gonna do? We got a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one may enter.
I must find this one, this...
Diamond in the rough.
Stop! Thief!
I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat.
All this for a loaf of bread?
Whoa!
- There he is!
- You won't get away so easy!
You think that was easy?
You two, over that way, and you, follow me.
- We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.
Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?
Trouble? No way. You're only in trouble if you get caught.
- Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.
And this time...
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.
- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get outta here.
Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
That's everything
One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke
- Riffraff
Street rat
Scoundrel
Take that
Just a little snack, guys
Rip him open
Take it back, guys
I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts
- You're my only friend, Abu
Who?
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one-man rise in crime
I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it
When I got the time
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume
There he is
One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll
Around the block
- Stop, thief
- Vandal
- Abu
- Scandal
Let's not be too hasty
Still I think he's rather tasty
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along
Wrong
Get him!
He's got a sword!
You idiots. We've all got swords.
- One jump ahead of the hoof beats
- Vandal!
- One hop ahead of the hump
- Street rat!
- One trick ahead of disaster
- Scoundrel!
They're quick, but I'm much faster
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump
Yuck! Oy!
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast. All right.
Yum, yum!
Uh-oh.
Here. Go on. Take it.
Ah, don't. Huh?
On his way to the palace, I suppose.
Another suitor for the princess.
Out of my way, you filthy brats.
Hey!
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.
Look at that, Abu.
It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends.
Ooh!
You are a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you.
I'm not worthless.
And I don't have fleas.
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.
Riffraff, street rat
I don't buy that
If only they'd look closer
Would they see a poor boy?
No, siree
They'd find out
There's so much more
To me
Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.
We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all.
I've never been so insulted.
Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you?
Good luck marrying her off.
Oh! Jasmine.
Jasmine!
Jasmine!
Confound it, Rajah.
So, this is why Prince
Achmed stormed out.
Oh, Father.
Rajah was just playing with him. Weren't you, Rajah?
You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince
Achmed, weren't you?
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call.
The law says you must be married to a prince by your next birthday.
The law is wrong.
You've only got three more days.
Father, I hate being forced into this.
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.
Jasmine, it's not only this law.
I'm not going to be around forever, and, well, I...
I just want to make sure you're taken care of.
Provided for.
Please try to understand.
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.
Except you, Rajah.
I've never even been outside the palace walls.
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.
Then maybe I don't want to be a princess any more.
Oooh! I... I...
Allah forbid you should have any daughters.
Hmm?
I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Oh! Ah, Jafar.
My most trusted advisor.
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.
My life is but to serve you, my lord.
It's this suitor business. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!
Oh!
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
Now, then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem.
If anyone can help, it's you.
But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.
Oh. Uh, my ring?
But it's been in the family for years.
It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
The diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Whatever you need will be fine.
You are most gracious, my liege.
Now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm?
Yes. That will be pretty good.
I can't take it any more!
If I gotta choke down on one more of those mouldy, disgusting crackers...
Bam! Whack!
Calm yourself, Iago.
Then I'd grab him around the head. Whack!
Soon I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit.
And then I stuff the crackers down his throat. Ha, ha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.
I'll miss you.
Good bye.
Okay, Abu. Go.
Try this. Your taste buds will dance and sing.
Get your paws off that.
Why, you...
Get away from here, you cursed, filthy ape!
Good bye.
Nice going, Abu.
Breakfast is served.
Pretty lady, buy a pot. No finer pot in brass or silver.
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.
Fresh fish!
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
Oh, no. I don't think so.
Oh!
Excuse me.
I'm really very sorry.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
Hello? Hello?
Oh, you must be hungry.
Here you go.
You'd better be able to pay for that.
- Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.
- Thief!
- Please...
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the sultan.
Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
No! No, please!
Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found her.
I've been looking all over for you.
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.
You, uh, know this girl?
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.
She's a little crazy.
She said she knew the sultan.
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?
Tragic, isn't it?
But no harm done.
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.
Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?
No, no, no. Not that one.
Come on, Sultan.
Huh? What?
Come back here, you little thieves!
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.
Yes, O mighty evil one.
Part, sands of time.
Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave.
Yes! Yes!
There he is.
My diamond in the rough.
That's him? That's the clown we've been waitin' for?
Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?
Swell.
Almost there.
I want to thank you for stopping that man.
Uh, forget it.
So, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?
Is it that obvious?
Well, you do kind of stand out.
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.
Wow.
Hey.
Come on. This way.
Whoa. Watch your head there.
Be careful.
Is this where you live?
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.
That sounds fabulous.
Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view.
Wow. The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
Oh, it's wonderful.
I wonder what it would be like to live there, and have servants and valets.
Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.
It's better than here.
You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards.
You're not free to make your own choices.
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...
- Trapped.
- Trapped.
So, where are you from?
What does it matter?
I ran away and I am not going back.
- Really? How come?
- Why, you...
My father's forcing me to get married.
That's... That's awful.
Abu!
What?
Abu says, uh, that's not fair.
What?
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.
And does Abu have anything else to say?
Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help.
Oh, boy.
Hmm.
Tell him that's very sweet.
Here you are.
- They're after me!
- They're after you?
My father must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...
Then jump!
We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat?
Run! Go! Get out of here!
Get this thing off of me!
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.
Let him go.
Looky here, men. A street mouse.
Unhand him, by order of the princess.
Princess Jasmine.
- The princess?
- Princess?
What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat.
That's not your concern. Do as
I command. Release him.
I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar.
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.
Jafar?
Oh, Princess.
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.
How may I be of service to you?
The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.
Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah.
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?
I can't breathe, Jafar.
Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.
Oh, dear.
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...
What do you mean?
Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.
What sentence?
Death.
- By beheading.
- No.
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.
How could you?
So, how did it go?
I think she took it rather well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
I didn't even know his name.
She was the princess.
I can't believe it.
I must have sounded so stupid to her.
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Hello!
Abu. Down here.
Come on, help me out of these.
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry, Abu.
I'll never see her again.
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.
She's gotta marry a prince.
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!
I'm a fool.
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.
Who are you?
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.
But together, perhaps we can be more.
I'm listening.
There is a cave, boy, a Cave of Wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
Ooh!
Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager.
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.
But the law says only a prince can...
You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you?
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.
Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?
I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.
Uh, one problem.
It's out there. We're in here.
Uh-uh. Things aren't always what they seem.
So, do we have a deal?
Oh, I don't know.
Who disturbs my slumber?
Uh, it is I, Aladdin.
Proceed.
Touch nothing but the lamp.
Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and then you shall have your reward.
Come on, Abu.
Would you look at that!
Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan.
Abu!
Don't touch anything.
We gotta find that lamp.
Huh?
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?
Abu, what are you, crazy?
A magic carpet.
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.
Thanks.
Wait a minute. Don't go.
Maybe you can help us.
Hey! Whoa!
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.
I think he knows where it is.
Wait here.
Oh!
This is it?
This is what we came all the way down here to...
Abu! No!
- Infidels!
- Uh-oh.
You have touched the forbidden treasure!
Now you will never again see the light of day!
Whoa!
Help! Help! Help!
Gotcha!
Carpet, let's move.
Abu!
Abu, this is no time to panic.
Start panicking.
Whoa!
- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.
First give me the lamp.
Yes!
At last!
What are you doing?
Giving you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
It's mine.
It's all mine.
I... Where is it?
No.
No!
Jasmine?
Oh, dearest.
What's wrong?
Jafar has done something terrible.
There, there, my dear.
We'll set it right.
Now, tell me everything.
Oh.
Aladdin. Wake up.
Aladdin.
Oh! My head.
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal!
Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.
Aha!
Why, you hairy little thief.
Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.
Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out.
Aah!
Oy!
10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck.
Hang on a second.
Whoa! Whoa!
Does it feel good to be outta there.
I'm telling you, nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?
How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."
I must have hit my head harder than I thought.
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
Oh, sorry, Cheeta. Hope
I didn't singe the fur.
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you in a few millennia.
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.
Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master.
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?
Wait a minute. I'm your master?
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?
The ever impressive, the long contained, the often imitated, but never duplicated...
Duplicated, duplicated...
Genie of the Lamp!
Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your very much wish fulfillment.
Thank you.
- Whoa. Wish fulfillment?
- Three wishes, to be exact.
And ixnay on the wishing for more wishes.
That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres.
No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.
Now I know I'm dreaming.
Master, I don't think you quite realise what you've got here.
So why don't you just ruminate whilst
I illuminate the possibilities.
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power
In your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizzazz
Yahoo and how
See, all you gotta do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say
"Mr Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?"
Let me take your order
Jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
Come on, whisper what it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me
Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service
You're the boss, the king, the shah
Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish
How 'bout a little more baklava?
Have some of column A
Try all of column B
I'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me
Oh, my
No, no
My, my
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof
Hey, looky here
Ha-ha!
Can your friends go
"Abracadabra, let her rip"
And then make the sucker disappear?
So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers
You got me bona fide certified
You got a genie
For your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish?
I really wanna know
You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt
All you gotta do is rub like so
Mr Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three
I'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend
You ain't never had a friend
Like me
Ah-ha-ha!
Wah-ha-ha!
You ain't never had a friend like me
Huh?
So, what'll it be, master?
You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want, right?
Ah, almost.
There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos.
Like?
Ah, rule number one,
I can't kill anybody.
So don't ask.
Rule number two.
I can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else.
You little ponem there.
Rule number three. I can't bring people back from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.
Other than that, you got it.
- Hmm.
- Oh!
Provisos? You mean limitations?
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.
Can't even bring people back from the dead.
I don't know, Abu. He probably can't even get us out of this cave.
Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here.
Excuse me?
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?
And all of sudden you're walking out on me?
I don't think so, not right now.
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!
In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere.
Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet.
We're...
Outta here!
Jafar, this is an outrage.
If it weren't for all your years of loyal service...
From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded.
I assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again.
Jasmine...
Jafar. Let's put this whole messy business behind us.
Please.
My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, Princess.
At least some good will come of my being forced to marry.
When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.
There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.
Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business... Jasmine?
Jasmine!
If only I had gotten that lamp.
"I will have the power to get rid of you."
To think we gotta keep kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.
Only until she finds a chump husband.
Then she'll have us banished.
Or beheaded.
Eww!
Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.
What if you were the chump husband?
What?
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?
And, uh, then you become the sultan.
Oh.
Marry the shrew.
I become the sultan.
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.
And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff.
Yaaah!
Kersplat!
I love the way your foul little mind works.
Thank you for choosing Magic
Carpet for all your travel needs.
Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop.
Thank you. Goodbye now.
Good-bye. Thank you.
Well, how about that,
Mr Doubting Mustafa?
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.
Dost mine ears deceive me?
Three? You are down by one, boy.
Ah, no. I never actually wished to get out of the cave.
You did that on your own.
Well, I feel sheepish.
All right, you bad boy, but no more freebies.
Fair deal. So, three wishes.
I want them to be good.
What would you wish for?
Me?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.
- What?
- No, I can't. I...
Come on. Tell me.
Freedom.
You're a prisoner?
It's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
Itty bitty living space.
Genie, that's terrible.
But, oh, to be free...
Not have to go, "Poof.
What do you need?
"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"
To be my own master.
Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world.
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.
Why not?
The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.
So you can guess how often that's happened.
I'll do it. I'll set you free.
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.
After I make my first two wishes,
I'll use my third wish to set you free.
Well, here's hopin'. All right.
Let's make some magic.
So how 'bout it? What is it you want most?
Well, there's this girl.
Wrong.
I can't make anybody fall in love, remember?
Oh, but, Genie, she's smart and fun and...
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.
She's got these eyes that just... And this hair. Wow.
And her smile...
Ami.
C'est l'amour.
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...
Hey, can you make me a prince?
Let's see here.
Chicken à la king? Nope.
Alaskan king crab. Ow.
I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No.
Aha. "To make a prince."
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.
Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince.
All right!
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!
First, that fez-and-vest combo is much too third century.
These patches. What are we trying to say, beggar?
No. Let's work with me here.
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?
It says mode of transportation.
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aquí. Over here.
- Uh-oh.
- Here he comes.
What better way to make your entrance on the streets of Agrabah than riding your very own, brand-new camel?
Watch out. They spit.
Mmm. Not enough.
Still not enough. Let's see.
What do you need?
Yes!
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.
Whoa!
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.
Abu, you look good.
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.
But we're not through yet.
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.
Sire, I've found a solution to the problem with your daughter.
Awk. The problem with your daughter.
Oh, really?
Right here.
"If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,
"then the sultan shall choose for her."
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.
How could I choose someone she hates?
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.
"If in the event a suitable prince cannot be found..."
Jerk.
"A princess must then be wed to..."
Hmm. Interesting.
What? Who?
The royal vizier.
Why, that would be me.
But I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess.
I'm quite sure that...
Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.
Yes. Desperate measures.
You will order the princess to marry me.
I will order the princess to...
But you're so old.
The princess will marry me.
The princess will marry...
What? What is that?
That music.
Jafar, you must come and see this.
Make way for Prince Ali
Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star
Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye
Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums
You're gonna love this guy
Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday salaam
Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie
Prince Ali, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa
Strong as 10 regular men definitely
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords? Why, Prince Ali
He's got 75 golden camels
Don't they look lovely, June?
Purple peacocks, he's got 53
Fabulous, Harry.
I love the feathers.
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you
It's a world-class menagerie
Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa
That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali
- He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
- He's got the monkeys
- Let's see the monkeys
- And to view them he charges no fee
He's generous
So generous
He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali
Prince Ali
Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why
He got dolled up and dropped by
With 60 elephants, llamas galore
With bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his 40 fakirs
His cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way
For Prince Ali
Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.
Your Majesty,
I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.
This is my royal vizier,
Jafar. He's delighted, too.
Ecstatic.
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.
Whatever.
You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to...
By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.
Ooh.
I don't suppose I might...
Why, certainly,
Your Majesty. Allow me.
Sire, I must advise against this.
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.
Ow, ow, ow.
Ahh! Whoa!
Look out, here I come.
Just where did you say you were from?
Oh, much farther than you've travelled, I'm sure.
- Try me.
- Look out, Polly.
Hey, watch it.
Watch it with the dumb rug.
Aah!
Whew!
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.
If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure. Not!
Jasmine will like this one.
And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no. I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.
This boy is no different from the others.
What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?
Your Majesty, I am
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.
How dare you.
All of you. Standing around deciding my future?
I am not a prize to be won.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to cool down.
I think it's time to say good-bye to Prince Abubu.
What am I gonna do?
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.
I should've known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.
So move.
Hey.
That's a good move.
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.
Genie, I need help.
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.
If you wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter.
- Do you got it?
- What?
No way.
If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.
A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh.
Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.
I just... I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.
How do I look?
Like a prince.
Princess Jasmine?
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.
I do not want to see you.
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.
- Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.
So, how's our little beau doing?
Good kitty, take off.
Down, kitty.
Wait. Wait.
Do I know you?
Uh, no. No.
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.
The marketplace?
I have servants who go to the marketplace for me.
Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met.
No. I guess not.
Enough about you,
Casanova. Talk about her.
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.
Anything. Pick a feature.
Ahem. Uh, Princess
Jasmine? You're very...
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,
- punctual.
- Punctual.
- Punctual?
- Sorry.
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.
Hmm.
I'm rich, too, you know.
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.
I know.
A fine prize for any prince to marry.
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.
Warning! Warning!
Right. A prince like you.
And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering peacock I've met.
Mayday! Mayday!
Just go jump off a balcony!
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.
Okay, fine. But remember,
"bee" yourself.
- Yeah, right.
- What?
Uh... Uh, you're right.
You aren't just some prize to be won.
You should be free to make your own choice.
I'll go now.
- No!
- What? What?
How...
How are you doing that?
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.
You, uh...
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace, see the world.
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
Yes.
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, Princess
Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place
I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in
A whole new world with you
Now I'm in
A whole new world with you
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes
- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
- A whole new world
- Every turn a surprise
- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share
This whole new world with you
- A whole new world
- A whole new world
- That's where we'll be
- That's where we'll be
- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place
For you and me
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
Nah. He hates fireworks.
He doesn't like flying, either.
Uh, that is, um... Oh, no.
You are the boy from the market. I knew it.
- Why did you lie to me?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.
Who are you? Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The truth. Um...
The truth is...
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um, to escape the pressures of palace life.
But I really am a prince.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Well, you know, royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think?
Hmm.
Not that strange.
Good night, my handsome prince.
Sleep well, Princess.
Yes!
For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right.
Abu. Abu.
Hold him.
I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abubu.
Why, you...
Make sure he's never found.
Never fails. You get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp.
Hello? AI?
Al! Kid, snap out of it.
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.
You have to say, "Genie, I want you to save my life." Got it?
Come on, Aladdin!
I'll take that as a yes.
Up scope.
Don't you scare me like that.
Genie, I, uh...
I...
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.
Not that I wanna pick out curtains or anything.
Jasmine.
Oh, Father, I just had the most wonderful time.
- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.
I have chosen a husband for you.
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.
I will never marry you.
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.
Better check your crystal ball again, Jafar.
Prince Ali!
How in the... Uh. Awk!
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.
What? Ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness.
He is obviously lying.
Obviously lying.
Father, what's wrong with you?
I know what's wrong.
Oh, my!
Your Highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this.
What? Jafar?
You, you traitor!
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
Guards! Guards!
Well, that's it.
We're dead. Forget it.
Just dig a grave for both of us. We're dead.
Arrest Jafar at once.
This is not done yet, boy.
Find him! Search everywhere!
- Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.
Jafar, my most trusted counsellor, plotting against me all this time.
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will I ever...
Huh?
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.
I won't. I'll leave that to my...
But you two will be wed at once.
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then you, my boy, will become sultan.
- Sultan?
- Yes.
A fine upstanding youth such as yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs.
We gotta get outta here. I gotta start packing. Only essentials.
We gotta travel light.
Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives, and how about this picture?
I think I'm making a weird face in it.
Oh, boy. He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.
Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!
Good grip.
Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin, Aladdin.
- He has the lamp, Iago.
- Why, that miserable...
But you are going to relieve him of it.
Me?
Sultan?
They want me to be Sultan?
Huzzah!
Hail the conquering hero
Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess.
What are you gonna do next?
Psst. Your line is, "I'm going to free the genie."
Any time.
- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.
You just go, "Genie,
I wish you free."
I'm serious.
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.
No. They wanna make
Prince Ali sultan.
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.
The only reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you.
What if they find out I'm not really a prince?
What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.
Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.
I can't wish you free.
Fine. I understand. After all, you've lied to everyone else.
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.
Genie, I'm really sorry.
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.
What are you guys looking at?
Look, I... I'm sorry.
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...
Wait. Come on.
What am I doing?
Genie's right.
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.
Ali. Oh, Ali. Will you come here?
Well, here goes.
Jasmine? Where are you?
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.
I'm coming.
You got a problem, Pinky?
Jerk.
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.
"Excellent work, Iago."
Ah, go on.
"No, really. On a scale of one to 10, you are an 11."
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.
People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor.
Jasmine.
Ali, where have you been?
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.
The whole kingdom's turned out for Father's announcement.
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.
- You don't understand...
- Good luck.
Ali Ababwa!
Oh, boy.
Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
Let them cheer.
You know, Al, I'm getting really...
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
I wish to rule on high as sultan.
- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.
What is this? What's going on?
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?
Father.
Jafar, you vile betrayer.
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.
The lamp.
Finders keepers, Abubu.
Genie, no!
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.
Jafar, I order you to stop.
Ah, but there's a new order now.
My order.
Finally, you will bow to me.
We will never bow to you.
Why am I not surprised?
If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer!
Genie, my second wish...
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!
Genie, stop!
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar!
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.
Down, boy.
Oh, Princess.
There's someone I'm dying to introduce you to.
Jafar. Get your hands off her.
Prince Ali
Yes, it is he
But not as you know him
Read my lips
And come to grips with reality
Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were too good to last
Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali
Or should we say Aladdin?
Ali?
Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just...
So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin
Just a con, need I go on
Take it from me
His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause
To send him packing
On a one-way trip
Genie!
So his prospects
Take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the Earth, whoopee!
- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.
Ex-Prince Ali
Abu.
Abu!
Oh, this is all my fault.
I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.
- Abu. Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
I'm sorry, Abu.
I made a mess of everything.
Somehow, I gotta go back and set things right.
Carpet.
Abu, start digging.
That's it.
Yeah! All right!
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.
Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here's your cracker. Shove them all the way down your throat.
Here. Have lots.
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.
It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.
A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
What do you say, my dear?
Why, with you as my queen...
Never.
I'll teach you some respect.
No. Genie.
I have decided to make my final wish.
I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me.
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas, some quid pro quos...
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout.
You will do what I order you to do, slave.
Jafar.
I never realised how incredibly handsome you are.
Mmm. That's better.
Now, pussycat, tell me more about myself.
You're tall, dark, well dressed...
AI. AI, little buddy.
Shh.
Al, I can't help you.
I work for Señor Psychopath now. What are you gonna do?
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? I'll improvise.
Cute little gaps between your teeth.
Go on.
And your beard is so twisted.
- You've stolen my heart.
- Jafar...
And the street rat?
What street rat?
Yech!
That was...
You!
How many times do I have to kill you, boy?
Get the lamp.
No!
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.
Jasmine.
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...
Don't toy with me.
Abu!
Things are unravelling fast now, boy.
Get the point?
I'm just getting warmed up.
Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?
A snake, am I?
Perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike I can be.
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake
You stay out of this.
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... Great!
Aladdin.
Jasmine, hang on.
You little fool.
You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth.
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.
The genie. The genie.
The genie has more power than you'll ever have.
What?
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.
Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?
Face it, Jafar. You're still just second best.
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.
But not for long.
The boy is crazy. He's a little punch-drunk.
One too many hits with the snake.
Slave, I make my third wish.
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!
All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al.
Yes.
Yes!
The power.
The absolute power!
- What have you done?
- Trust me.
The universe is mine to command, to control!
Not so fast, Jafar. Aren't you forgetting something?
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie, you got it.
What?
And everything that goes with it.
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
You're the genie. I don't want...
Itty bitty living space.
Al, you little genius, you.
Ahh!
Get your blasted beak out of my face.
- Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
Allow me.
Ten thousand years in a Cave of
Wonders ought to chill him out.
Shut up!
Jasmine...
I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince.
I know why you did.
Well, I guess this is good-bye?
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.
I love you.
Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left.
Just say the word and you're a prince again.
But, Genie, what about your freedom?
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.
This is love.
Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.
Believe me, I know. I've looked.
Jasmine, I do love you, but I got to stop pretending to be something I'm not.
I understand.
Genie, I wish for your freedom.
One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.
- What?
- Genie, you're free.
I'm free. I'm free.
Quick. Quick. Wish for something outrageous.
Say, "I want the Nile."
Wish for the Nile. Try that.
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!
I'm free! I'm free at last!
I'm hittin' the road. I'm off to see the world. I'm...
Genie, I'm...
I'm gonna miss you.
Me, too, Al.
No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me.
That's right.
You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned.
It's that law that's the problem.
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?
From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy.
Him. I choose...
I choose you, Aladdin.
Call me Al.
Oh, all of you, come over here. Big group hug.
Group hug.
Mind if I kiss the monkey?
Ooh, hairball.
Well, I can't do any more damage around this Popsicle stand.
I'm outta here!
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.
No, I'm mythology.
I don't care what I am. I'm free!
A whole new world
A whole new life
For you and me
A whole new world
Made you look.
You have been a fabulous audience.
Tell you what, you're the best audience in the whole world.
Take care of yourselves.
Good night, Alice!
Good night, Agrabah! Adiós, amigos!
Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill or under land
Orjust behind the tree
When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land beyond the eye
That people cannot see
Where can it be
Where do stars go
Where is the grass that blooms
They must be somewhere
Where is the sunny afternoon
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill or here or there
I wonder
Where
"... for if he does and had been of late...
"much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
"Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him, and even Stigand-"
- Alice.
- Hmm?
- Oh, I'm listening.
- "And even Stigand,
"the Archbishop of Canterbury, agreed to meet with William... and offer him the Crown. "
"William's conduct at first was model-"
Alice. Will you kindly pay attention to your history lesson?
I'm sorry, but how can one possibly pay attention... to a book with no pictures in it?
My dear child, there are a great many good books in this world without pictures.
In this world, perhaps, but in my world, the books would be nothing but pictures.
Your world? Huh!
What nonsense.
- Now, once more.
- Nonsense?
- From the beginning.
- That's it, Dinah.
If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense.
Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't, and contrariwise, what it is, it wouldn't be.
And what it wouldn't be, it would.
You see?
In my world, you wouldn't say "meow. "
You'd say,
"Yes, Miss Alice. "
Oh, but you would. You'd be just like people, Dinah.
And all the other animals too.
Why, in my world:
Cats and rabbits
Would reside in fancy little houses
And be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers
In a world of my own
All the flowers
Would have very extra-special powers
They would sit and talk to me
For hours, when I'm lonely
In a world of my own
There'd be new birds
Lots of nice and friendly how-de-do birds
Everyone would have a dozen bluebirds
Within that world
Of my own
I could listen
To a babbling brook
And hear a song that
I could understand
I keep wishing
It could be that way
Because my world would be
A wonderland.
Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit with a waistcoat- and a watch!
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!
Now this is curious. What could a rabbit possibly be late for?
- Please, sir!
- I'm late, I'm late
For a very important date
No time to say hello, Goodbye
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
- It must be awfully important.
Like a party or something.
Mr Rabbit! Wait!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm overdue
I'm really in a stew No time to say goodbye, Hello I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
My. What a peculiar place to have a party.
You know, Dinah, we really shouldn't... um- be doing this.
After all, we haven't been invited, and curiosity often leads to trouble.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!
Oh.
Well, after this, I shall think nothing of fall-
Oh. Of falling down stairs.
Oh!
Ahh.
Whoa!
Goodness. What if I should fall right through... the centre of the earth-
Oh! And come out the other side... where people walk upside down?
Oh, but that's silly.
Nobody- Oh!
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Wait!
Please!
Curiouser and curiouser!
- Ohh!
- Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.
Whew. Ha. It's quite all right, but you did give me quite a turn.
- You see, I was following-
- Rather good, what? Doorknob? Turn?
- Please, sir.
- Swell, huh?
One good turn deserves another.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm looking for a white rabbit, so, um, if you don't mind-
Eh? Oh!
- There he is! I simply must get through.
- Sorry. You're much too big.
- Simple impassable.
- You mean impossible.
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.
- Why don't you try the bottle on the table?
- Table? Oh!
Read the directions and directly you'll be directed in the right direction.
"Drink me. "
Hmm. Better look first, for if one drinks much... from a bottle marked "poison," it's almost certain to disagree with one sooner or later.
- Beg your pardon?
- I was just giving myself some good advice.
But- Mmm.
Tastes like, uh, cherry tart.
Custard, pineapple, roast turkey. Goodness!
- What did I do?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
You almost went out like a candle.
But look!
I'm just the right size.
Oh, no use.
I forgot to tell you.
I'm locked!
Oh, no!
Uh, but of course, uh, you've got the key, so-
- What key?
- Now don't tell me you've left it up there.
Oh, dear.
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.
Oh!
"Eat me. " All right, but goodness knows what this will do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh!
What did you say?
I said, "A little of that went a long way. "
Well, I don't think it's so funny.
Now- Now I shall n- never get home!
Oh, come, come, now.
Crying won't help.
I know, but I-I-
I just can't-
I can't stop!
Come! Oh! Say, this won't do.
It won't do at all.
You! You up there!
Stop!
I say! Oh, look!
The bottle. The bottle!
Oh, dear. I do wish
I hadn't cried so much.
Oh, a sailor's life is the life for me
How I love to sail on the bounding sea
And I never, never, ever do a thing about the weather
For the weather never, ever does a thing for me
Oh, a sailor's life is the life for me
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee
And I never, ev-
Ahoy!
And other nautical expressions!
Land ho, by Jove!
- Where away, Dodo?
- Dodo?
Three points to starboard.
Pull away, me hearties.
Have you in port in no time at all.
- Oh, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of sea
- Uh, Mr Dodo! Please!
- We'll all fish fry as we sail the sea
- Please help me!
Um, uh, uh, pardon me, but, uh, would you mind helping me, please?
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!
Help me. Please!
Won't you-
Help me!
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase
Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus race
Backward, forward, outward, inward bottom to the top
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop
Hopping, skipping, hopping, skipping
Fancy-free and gay
That's all they did tomorrow but you finished yesterday
Round and round and round we go until forevermore
Once we were behind but now we find we are be-
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase
Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus race
Ah, backward-
I say! You'll never get dry that way.
- Get dry?
- Have to run with the others.
First rule of a caucus race, you know.
But how can I-
That's better. Have you dry in no time now.
No one can ever get dry this way.
Nonsense! Why, I'm as dry as a bone already.
- Yes, but-
- All right, chaps. Let's have it now.
Look lively.
The White Rabbit.
Mr Rabbit. M-Mr Rabbit-
- Oh, my goodness! I'm late. I'm late.
- Oh-oh, don't go away.
- I'll be right back.
- I'm late, I'm late.
- I'm late, I'm late. - Don't step on the fish! Uh, w-w-watch it there.
Stop kicking that mackerel.
Brilliant!Jolly well-
Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit.
Oh, dear, I'm sure he came this way.
Do you suppose he could be hiding?
Hmm.
Not here.
I wonder.
No, I suppose he must've-
Oh! Why, what peculiar little figures.
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.
If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.
Contrary to wax, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak to us.
- That's logic.
- Well, it's been nice meeting you.
Goodbye.
You're beginning backwards.
Aye, the first thing in a visit is to say:
How do you do and shake hands
Shake hands, shake hands
How do you do and shake hands and state your name and business
- That's manners.
- Really?
Well, my name is Alice, and I'm following a white rabbit, so-
- No, you can't go yet.
- No, the visit has just started.
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?
- Or "Button, button, who's got the button"?
- No, thank you.
If you stay long enough, we might have a battle.
That's very kind of you, but I must be going.
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.
- Why? - Well, I-I'm curious to know where he's going.
Oh, she's curious.
The oysters were curious, too, weren't they?
Aye, and you remember what happened to them.
- Poor things.
- Poor things.
Why? What did happen to the oysters?
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, but I am.
No, no, you're in much too much of a hurry.
- Well, perhaps I could spare a little time.
- You could?
Well!
"The Walrus and the Carpenter. "
Or "The Story of the Curious Oysters. "
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might
He did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was
The middle of the night
The walrus and the carpenter
Were walking close at hand
The beach was wide from side to side
But much too full of sand
Mr Walrus said the carpenter
My brain begins to perk
We'll sweep this clear in half a year
If you don't mind the work
Work!
- Th-The time has come
- The walrus said
To talk of other things.:
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
And cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings
Calloo, callay
No work today
We're cabbages and kings
Oh, uh, oysters, come out and walk with us.
The day is warm and bright.
A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, would be a sheer delight.
Yes, and should we get hungry on the way, we'll stop and, uh, have a bite.
But Mother Oyster winked her eye
And shook her heavy head
She knew too well this was no time
To leave her oyster bed
The sea is nice
Take my advice
- And stay right here
- Mum said
Yes, yes, of course, of course, but, uh, ha-ha!
The time has come my little friends
To talk of other things
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot and, uh, whether pigs have wings
Calloo, callay
Come run away
With cabbages and kings
Well, now, uh, let me see.
Ah! A loaf of bread is what we chiefly need.
Listen, how 'bout some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
Well, yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Ha-ha. Very good indeed.
Now, if you're ready, oysters, dear, we can begin the feed.
- Feed?
- Oh, yes. Uh-
The time has come my little friends to talk of food and things
Of peppercorns and mustard seed and other seasonings
We'll mix 'em all together in a sauce that's fit for kings
Calloo, callay
We'll eat today
Like cabbages and kings
I, uh- I-I weep for you.
I- Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize.
For I've enjoyed your company... oh, much more than you realize.
Little oysters.
Little oysters.
But answer there came none
And this was scarcely odd because
They'd been eaten, every one
Well, uh-
The time has come!
With cabbages
And kings
- The end.
- That was a very sad story.
Aye, and there's a moral to it.
Oh, yes, a very good moral, if you happen to be an oyster.
- Well, it's been a very nice visit-
- Another recitation.
- I'm sorry, but-
- Entitled "Father William. "
- But really, I'm-
- First verse.
You are old, Father William the young man said
And your hair has become very white
And yet you incessantly stand on your head
Do you think at your age it is right, it's right
Do you think at your age it is right
Well, in me youth
Father William replied to his son
I'd do it again and again and again
And I've done it again and again and again
I wonder who lives here.
Mary Ann! Oh, drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?
- Mary Ann!
- The rabbit!
Mary Ann!
No use! Can't wait! I'm awfully late.
Oh, me. Oh, my. Oh, me. Oh, my.
Excuse me, sir, but- but I've been trying to-
Why, Mary Ann!
What are you doing out here?
- Mary Ann?
- Don't just do something. Stand there. No, no! Go, go!
- Go get my gloves. I'm late!
- But late for what?
- That's just what I-
- My gloves!
- At once! Do you hear?
- Goodness.
I suppose I'll be taking orders from Dinah next.
Hmm. Now let me see.
If I were a rabbit, where would I keep my gloves?
Oh! Thank you.
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, no, no, not again.
Oh! Mary Ann!
Now you see here,
Mary Ann. Help!
I need help!
Whoo-hoo! Ha! Oh!
No! Help!
Monster! Help! Assistance!
- Oh, dear.
- A monster! A monster, Dodo!
- In my house, Dodo. Oh, my poor little-bitty house. - The dodo.
Steady. Steady, old chap. Can't be as bad as all that, you know.
Oh, my poor roof and rafters.
All my walls and- There it is!
By Jove!
Jolly well is, isn't it?
Well, do something, Doo-doo.
Yes, indeed. An extraordinary situation, but, uh-
But, but, but, but, but what?
But I have a very simple solution.
- Thank goodness.
- W-W-W-What is it?
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Yes, g-g-go on, go on. Pull it out.
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.
What we need is a- Uh-
- A lizard with a ladder!
- Hmm? Oh! Bill!
Bill! We need a lazard with a lidder- A lidder- A b-b-b-
- Can you help us?
- At your service, governor.
Bill, me lad, have you ever been down a chimney?
Why, governor, I've been down more chimneys-
Excellent, excellent.
You just pop down the chimney... and haul that monster out of there.
Righto, governor.
Monster?
Steady now. There.
That's better.
Bill, lad, you're passing up a golden opportunity.
- I am?
- You can be famous.
- I can?
- Of course!
There's a brave lad.
In you go now.
Nothing to it, old boy.
Simply tie your tail... around the monster's neck and drag it out.
- B-But-But, governor-
- Good luck, Bill.
Well, there goes Bill.
- Poor Bill.
- Uh, perhaps we should try a- a more energetic remedy.
Yes! Anything, anything.
But hurry!
Oh, I-I propose that we, uh-
- Yes, go on, go on. Yes, yes.
- I propose we, uh-
Oh!
By Jove! That's it.
We'll burn the house down.
Yes. Burn the house- What?
- Oh, no.
- Oh-ho-ho!
Oh, we'll smoke the blighter out
We'll put the beast to rout
Some kindling
A stick or two
Ah, this bit of rubbish ought to do
- Oh, dear
- We'll smoke the blighter out
- We'll smoke the monster out
- No, no! Not my beautiful bird house!
Oh, we'll roast the blighter's toes
We'll toast the bounder's nose
Just fetch that gate
We'll make it clear
- That monsters aren't welcome here
- Oh, dear. Oh, me, oh, my.
- A match? Thank you.
- Match?
Without a single doubt we'll smoke the monster out
We'll smoke the monster out
No! No!
My poor house and furniture.
Oh, dear.
This is serious.
I simply must- Ah!
A garden.
Perhaps if I ate something, it would make me grow smaller.
Let go! Help!
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me! You, you, you, you-
You barbarian!
Help!
Monster!
Help!
Ah! I'm late! Oh, dear.
I'm here. I should be there.
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- I say, do you have a match?
Oh, no. Must go. Goodbye.
Hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- Wait! Please wait!
- Ah, young lady.
- Do you have a match?
- No, I-I'm sorry, but-
- Mr Rabbit!
- No cooperation. No cooperation at all.
Well, can't have monsters about.
Jolly well have to carry on alone.
Wait! Please!
Just a minute!
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him while I'm this small.
Why, what curious butterflies.
You mean bread-and-butterflies.
Oh, yes, of course, uh- Hmm?
Now who do you suppose-
A horsefly! I mean, a- a rocking horsefly.
- Naturally.
- I beg your pardon, but, uh, did you-
Oh, that's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.
But of course we can talk, my dear.
If there's anyone worth talking to.
Or about.
- And we sing too.
- You do?
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
"Tell It to the Tulips"?
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about the shy little violets.
- Oh, no, not that old thing.
- Let's do "Lovely Lily of the Valley. "
- How 'bout a daisy duet? - Oh, she wouldn't like that. - Oh, watch the rose.
Girls! We shall sing
"Golden Afternoon. "
That's about all of us.
Sound your "A," Lily.
La
Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
La, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Dum du dum-dum
Little bread-and-butterflies kiss the tulips
And the sun is like a toy balloon
There are
Get-up-in-the-morning glories
In the golden afternoon
There are dizzy daffodils on the hillside
Strings of violets are all in tune
Tiger lilies love the dandelions
In the golden afternoon
The gold afternoon
There are dog- and cat-erpillars
And a copper centipede
Where the lazy daisies
Love the very
Peaceful life
They lead
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month ofJune
Ah, ah, ah, ah
There's a wealth
Of happiness and romance
All in the golden
Afternoon
All in the golden afternoon
The golden afternoon
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month ofJune
There's a wealth of happiness
And romance
All-
The golden afternoon
Ah
- Oh, that was lovely!
- Thank you, my dear.
What kind of garden do you come from?
Oh, I don't come from any garden.
Do you suppose she's a wild flower?
Oh, no.
I'm not a wild flower.
Just what specie- or shall we say genus- are you, my dear?
Well, I suppose you'd call me... a Genus Humanus Alice.
Ever see an Alice with a blossom like that?
Come to think of it, did you ever see an Alice?
Yes. And did you notice her petals?
What a peculiar colour.
And no fragrance.
Just look at those stems.
Rather scrawny, I'd say.
I think she's pretty.
- Quiet, bud.
- But I'm not a flower.
Aha!Just as I suspected.
She's nothing but a common
Mobile Vulgaris.
Oh, no!
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly:
- A weed.
- I'm not a weed.
- Well, you wouldn't expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?
- Well, goodness!
- Don't let her stay here and go to seed.
- Go on now. Don't you take root-
- Please, girls!
We don't want weeds in our bed.
Move along, move along.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.
If I were my right size, I could pick every one of you if I wanted to.
And I guess that would teach you.
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers.
Hm! Seems to me they could learn a few things about manners.
A
E- I-O-U
A- E-I-O-U
A- E-I-O-U
Who
U- E-I-O-A
U- E-I-A
A- E-I-O-U
Who are you?
Well, I-I-I hardly know, sir.
I've changed so many times since this morning, you see-
I do not see.
Explain yourself.
I'm afraid I can't explain myself, sir, because I'm not myself, you know.
I do not know.
Well, I can't put it any more clearly, for it isn't clear to me.
You? Who are you?
Well, don't you think you ought to tell me... who you are first?
Why?
Oh, dear, everything is so confusing.
- It is not.
- Well, it is to me.
- Why? - Well, I can't remember things as I used to, and-
- Recite.
- Hmm?
Oh. Oh, oh, yes, sir. Um-
How doth the little busy bee improve each shin-
Stop.
That is not spoken correct-ically.
It goes:
How-
How doth the little crocodile... improve his shining tail... and pour the waters of the Nile... on every golden scale?
How cheer-
How cheer-
How cheerfully he seems to grin.
How neatly spreads his claws... and welcomes little fishes in... with gently smiling jaws.
Well, I must say I've never heard it that way before.
I know.
I have improved it.
Well- If you ask me-
You? Heh!
Who are you?
Oh!
Uh, you there. Girl!
Wait! Come back!
I have something important to say.
Oh, dear.
I wonder what he wants now.
Well?
Keep your temper.
- Is that all?
- No.
Exact-ically what is your problem?
Well, it's exact-ically- exact-ical-
Well, it's precisely this:
I should like to be a little larger, sir.
- Why?
- Well, after all, three inches is such a wretched height-
I am exact-ically three inches high!
And it is a very good height indeed!
But I'm not used to it, and you needn't... shout!
- Oh, dear.
- By the way, I have a few more helpful hints.
One side will make you grow taller.
- One side of what?
- And the other side will make you grow shorter.
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!
Hmm.
One side will make me grow-
But which is which?
Hmm. After all that's happened, I-
I wonder if I-
I don't care.
I'm tired of being only three inches high.
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!
A serpent! Help!
Help! Serpent! Serpent!
Oh, but please, please!
Off with you! Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent! Serpent!
- But I'm not a serpent.
- Ser- Indeed?
- Then just what are you?
- I'm just a little girl.
Little? Ha! Little?
Well, I am.
I mean, I-I was.
And I suppose you don't eat eggs either.
- Yes, I do, but, but, but-
- Ah! I knew it! I knew it.
Serpent. Serpent!
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Hmm! And the other side will-
The very idea.
Spend all my time laying eggs for serpents like her.
Goodness. I wonder if I'll ever get the knack of it.
There. That's much better.
Hmm. Better save these.
Now let's see.
Where was I?
Hmm. I- I wonder which way I ought to go.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogroves
And the mome raths outgrabe
Now where in the world do you suppose that-
- Lose something?
- Oh!
Oh, uh- I-
I was- N-No.
I- I-I mean, I-I was just wondering-
Oh, that's quite all right.
Uh, one moment, please.
Ooh.
Second chorus.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
Why- Why, you're a cat.
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy
Were the borogroves
Oh, wait!
Don't go, please.
There you are.
Third chorus.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, but-
But I just wanted to ask you which way I ought to go.
Well, that depends... on where you want to get to.
Oh, it really doesn't matter, as long as I-
Then it really doesn't matter... which way you go.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Oh, by the way.
If you'd really like to know, he went that way.
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.
- He did?
- He did what?
- Went that way.
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.
- What rabbit?
But didn't you just say-
I mean- Oh, dear.
Can you stand on your head?
- Oh!
- However, if I were looking for a white rabbit,
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.
The Mad Hatter? Um, no, no, I-I don't think-
Or there's the March Hare... in that direction.
Uh, thank you. I-I think
I shall visit him.
Of course, he's mad too.
Oh, but I don't want to go among mad people.
Oh, you can't help that.
Most everyone's mad here.
You may have noticed... that I'm not all there myself.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Goodness. If the people here are like that, I-
I must try not to upset them.
How very curious.
If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Oh, a very merry unbirthday
- A very merry unbirthday
A very merry unbirthday to us
A very merry unbirthday to me
- To who - To me - Oh, you
A very merry unbirthday to you
- Who, me -
Yes, you - Oh, me
Let's all congratulate us with another cup of tea
A very merry unbirthday
To
You
- No room, no room, no room.
- No vacancy.
- No room, no room, no room!
- But I thought there was plenty of room.
Ah, but it's very rude to sit down without being invited.
I'll say it's rude.
It's very, very rude indeed.
Very, very, very rude indeed.
Oh, I'm very sorry, but I did enjoy your singing, and I wondered if you could tell me-
You enjoyed our singing?
Oh, what a delightful child.
Things happen. I'm so excited!
We never get compliments.
- You must have a cup of tea.
- Ah, yes, indeed, the tea.
- You must have a cup of tea.
- That would be very nice.
I'm sorry I interrupted your birthday party.
- Uh-uh, thank you.
- Birthday? Ha-ha-ha.
My dear child, this is not a birthday party.
Of course not.
This is an unbirthday party.
Unbirthday? Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand.
It's very simple.
Now, 30 days hath Sept-
No. Well. An unbirthday-
If you have a birthday, then, you-
- She doesn't know what an unbirthday is.
- How silly!
Well, I-
I shall elucidate.
Now statistics prove prove that you've one birthday
Imagine.:just one birthday every year
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays
Precisely why we're gathered here to cheer
Why, then, today is my unbirthday too.
- It is?
- What a small world this is.
In that case-
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me
- To you
- A very merry unbirthday
- For me
- For you
Now blow the candle out, my dear and make your wish come true
A very merry unbirthday
To you
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat,
How I wonder what you're at.
Up above the world you fly...
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
- Oh, that was lovely.
- And, uh, and now, my dear, uh, you were saying that you would like to seek-
Pardon me.
Uh, you were seeking, uh, some information of some kind?
Oh, yes. You see,
I'm looking for a-
Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down!
- But I haven't used my cup.
- Drink up, drink up
Move down, move down
Drink up, drink up, move down
Would you like a little more tea?
Well, I haven't had any yet, so I can't very well take more.
Ah, you mean you can't very well take less.
Yes. You can always take more than nothing.
- But I only meant that-
- And now, my dear, something, uh, seems to be troubling you.
Uh, won't you tell us all about it?
- Start at the beginning.
- Yes, yes.
And when you come to the end, stop, see?
Well, it all started... while I was sitting on the riverbank with Dinah.
Very interesting.
- Who's Dinah?
- Why, Dinah's my cat. You see-
Ah! Cat?
- Get the jam. On his nose. Put it on his nose.
- On his nose, on his nose.
- C-C-Cat.
- Oh. Oh.
My goodness. Those are the things that upset me.
See all the trouble you've started?
- But really, I didn't think that-
- Ah, but that's the point.
- If you don't think, you shouldn't talk.
- Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down, move down, move down!
- But I still haven't used-
- Move down, move down, move down
Move down
And now, my dear, as you were saying?
Oh, yes. I was sitting on the riverbank with, uh, with you-know-who.
I do?
I mean my c-a-t.
Tea?
Just half a cup, if you don't mind.
Come, come, my dear.
Don't you care for tea?
Why, yes, I'm very fond of tea, but-
If you don't care for tea, you could at least make polite conversation.
Well, I've been trying to ask you-
I have an excellent idea.
Let's change the subject.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
Riddles?
Let me see now.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- I beg your pardon?
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- Why is a what?
- Careful. She's stark, ravin' mad.
But, but it's your silly riddle.
You just said-
- Steady. Don't get excited.
- How about a nice cup of tea?
Have a cup of tea, indeed. Well,
I'm sorry, but I just haven't the time.
The time! The time!
Who's got the time?
No, no, no, no. No time, no time, no time.
Hello. Goodbye.
I'm late. I'm late.
- The White Rabbit!
- Oh, I'm so late.
I'm so very, very late.
Well, no wonder you're late. Why, this clock is exactly two days slow.
- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.
My goodness.
We'll have to look into this. Aha!
I see what's wrong with this.
Why, this watch is full of wheels.
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.
- But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but- - Butter! Of course!
It needs some butter.
Butter!
- Butter!
- But-but-butter?
Butter. Oh, thank you.
Butter. Yes, that's fine.
Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
You'll get crumbs in it.
Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?
- Tea?
- Tea! Oh, I never thought of tea! Of course.
- Don't! Don't! Not tea!
- Tea.
- Sugar?
- Sugar? Two spoons. Yes, y- Two spoons.
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh, please be careful!
- Jam?
- Jam! I forgot all about the jam.
- No! Not jam!
- Just shows you what a person'll do.
- Mustard?
- Mustard, yes! Mus-
Mustard?
Don't let's be silly.
Lemon- that's different.
That's- There.
That should do it.
- Look at that. - It's going mad. - Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, dear. - It's going mad.
Mad watch. - Oh, my goodness.
- I can't understand it. It was the best butter.
- Mad watch. Mad watch.
- Mad watch! - Oh, look. Do you think the springs- Oh, my goodness!
There's only one way to stop a mad watch.
Two days slow.
That's what it is.
- Oh, my watch.
- It was?
And it was an unbirthday present too.
- Well, in that case.
- A very merry unbirthday
To
- You
- Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Oh, now where did he go to?
A very merry unbirthday to us, to us
- If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Of all the silly nonsense.
This is the stupidest tea party
I've ever been to in all my life.
Well, I've had enough nonsense.
I'm going home.
Straight home.
That rabbit. Who cares where he's going anyway?
Why, if it hadn't been for him, I-
"Tulgey Wood. "
Hmm. Curious.
I don't remember this.
Now let me see.
Oh!
Mmm, no, no, please.
No more nonsense.
Now, if I came this way,
I should go back this way.
Oh, I-I beg your pardon.
My goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.
If I- If I ever do get home.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Um, could one of you tell me-
Uh- Heh-heh. Never mind.
Oh, dear. It's getting dreadfully dark.
And nothing looks familiar.
I shall certainly be glad to get out of- Oh!
Who. Who-who.
Who.
It would be so nice if something would make sense for a change.
Oh!
"Don't step on the mome raths. "
The mome raths?
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.
Ah. I just knew I'd find one sooner or later.
If I hurry fast, I might even be home in time for tea.
Oh. Oh, won't Dinah be happy to see me.
Oh, I just can't wait till I- Ah!
Oh, dear. Now I-
Now I shall never get out.
Well, when- when one's lost,
I- I suppose it's good advice... to stay where you are until someone finds you.
But- But who'd ever think to look for me here?
Good advice.
If, If, If, If I'd listened earlier, I-I wouldn't be here.
But- But that's just the trouble with me.
I give myself very good advice.
But I very seldom follow it
That explains
The trouble that
I'm always in
Be patient
Is very good advice
But the waiting makes me curious
And I'd love the change
Should something strange
Begin
Well, I went along my merry way.
And I never stopped to reason.
I should have known
There'd be a price to pay
Someday
I give myself
Very good advice
But I very seldom follow it
Will I ever learn
To do the things
I should
Will I ever learn
Learn to do the things
I should
And the mome raths outgrabe
Oh, Cheshire Cat!
It's you!
Whom did you expect?
The White Rabbit perchance?
Oh, no, no, no.
I- I-I'm through with rabbits.
I wanna go home!
- But I can't find my way.
- Naturally.
That's because you have no way.
All ways here, you see, are the Queen's way.
- But I've never met any Queen.
- You haven't?
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!
She'll be mad about you.
Simply mad.
And the mome raths outgrabe
Please, please! Uh, how can I find her?
Well, some go this way.
Some go that way.
But as for me, myself, personally,
I prefer the short cut.
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
We dare not stop or waste a drop
So let the paint be spread
We're painting the roses red
Oh, painting the roses red
And many a tear we shed
- Because we know
- They'll cease to grow
In fact they'll soon be dead
Ohh, and yet we go ahead
Painting the roses red, red red, red, red, red, red, red
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
Oh, pardon me, but, Mr Three why must you paint them red
Huh? Oh!
Well, the fact is, miss, we planted the white roses by mistake, and-
The Queen she likes them red
If she saw white instead
- She'd raise a fuss
- And each of us
- Would quickly lose his head
- Goodness!
Since this is the thought we dread
- We're painting the roses red
- Oh, dear.
Then let me help you.
- Painting the roses red
- We're painting the roses red
Don't tell the Queen what you have seen
Or say that's what we said but we're painting the roses red
Yes, painting the roses red
- Not pink - Not green - Not aquamarine
We're painting the roses red
- The Queen!
- The Queen!
- Queen!
- The Queen!
Cards, halt!
Sound off!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack!
The rabbit.
H- H-Her Imperial Highness,
Her, Her Grace,
Her Excellency, Her Royal
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!
- And the King.
- Hooray!
Hmm! Who's been painting my roses red?
Who's been painting my roses red?
Who dares to paint with vulgar paint
The Royal flower bed
For painting my roses red
Someone will lose his head
Oh, no, Your Majesty, please!
It's all his fault!
Not me, Your Grace!
The ace! The ace!
- You? The deuce, you say?
- No! Two!
- Not me! The trey!
- That's enough!
Off with their heads!
They're going to lose their heads
For painting the roses red
It serves them right, they planted white
The roses should be red
Oh, they're going to lose their heads
Silence!
Oh, please, please.
They were only trying-
- And who is this?
- Uh, well. Well, well, now, uh, uh, let me see, my dear.
It certainly isn't a heart.
Uh, do you suppose it's a club?
Why, it's a little girl.
- Yes. A-And I was hoping-
- Look up. Speak nicely.
And don't twiddle your fingers!
Turn out your toes. Curtsy.
Open your mouth a little wider.
And always say:
"Yes, Your Majesty. "
"Yes, Your Majesty. "
Now, um, where do you come from, and where are you going?
W- Well, I-I'm trying to find my way home.
Your way? All ways here are my ways!
Well, yes, I-I know.
But I was just thinking-
Curtsy while you're thinking.
It saves time.
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
But I was only going to ask-
I'll ask the questions!
Do you play croquet?
- Why, yes, Your Majesty.
- Then let the game begin!
To your places. To your places. By order of the King. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Shuffle deck!
Card cut! Deal cards!
Cards, halt!
Silence!
Off with his head!
Off with his head. Off with his head. By order of the King. Uh, you heard what she said.
- You're next, my dear.
- Oh, but-
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
Oh!
- Stop!
- Oh, of all the impossible-
Do you want us both to lose our heads?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I don't.
Uh, I say, how are you getting on?
- Not at all.
- Beg pardon?
I said, not at all!
Who are you talking to?
- Oh, uh, a cat, Your Majesty.
- Cat? Where?
There. Oh.
- Oh, there he is again!
- I warn you, child, if I lose my temper, you lose your head!
Understand?
You know, we could make her really angry. Shall we try?
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, but it's loads of fun.
No, no, no! Stop!
Oh, no!
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
Oh, dear! Save the Queen.
Someone's head will roll for this!
Yours!
- Off with her-
- But, but, but, but consider, my dear.
Uh, couldn't she have a trial? Huh? First?
- Trial?
- Well, th-Just a, a little trial? Hmm?
Hmm. Very well, then.
Let the trial begin!
Your Majesty.
Members of the jury.
Loyal subjects.
And the King.
The prisoner at the bar is charged with enticing Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, into a game of croquet and thereby willfully...
- But- - and with malice aforethought, teasing, tormenting...
- and otherwise annoying our beloved-
- Never mind all that!
Get to the part where
I lose my temper.
Thereby causing the Queen to lose her temper.
Now, are you ready for your sentence?
Sentence? Oh, but there must be a verdict first.
Sentence first!
Verdict afterwards.
- But that just isn't the way!
- All ways are-
Your ways, Your Majesty.
Uh, yes, my child.
Off with her-
- But consider, my dear. Eh, we've called no witnesses.
- Huh?
Uh, couldn't we hear maybe one or two? Huh? Maybe?
Oh, very well.
But get on with it!
- First witness. First witness. Herald, call the first witness.
- The March Hare.
Uh, oh, oh, what do you know about this, uh, unfortunate affair?
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!
Jury, write that down.
Uh, unimportant, uh,
Your Majesty means of course.
Silence! Next witness.
The Dormouse.
- Well-
- Shh!
What have you to say about this?
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.
How I wonder-
That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet.
Write that down!
- Twinkle, twinkle. Twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle.
Twinkle, twinkle.
What next?
The Mad Hatter.
- Off with your hat!
- Oh, my!
And, uh, where were you when this horrible crime was committed?
I was home drinking tea.
Today, you know, is my unbirthday.
Why, my dear, today is your unbirthday too.
- It is?
- It is?
It is?
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me?
- Oh, no!
- To you! A very merry unbirthday
- For me?
- For you!
Now blow the candle out, my dear, and make your wish come true.
A very merry unbirthday
To you
Oh! Your Majesty.
Uh, yes, my dear?
Look! There he is now!
- Huh? Wha- Who?
- The Cheshire Cat.
- Cat!
- Cat?
- Cat! Cat, cat, cat, cat!
- There he goes! There he goes!
- Oh, this is terrible! Help! Help!
- Stop him! Stop him!
- Stop him. Catch him.
- Somebody help me. Catch him.
- Get me the jam. The jam, quick.
- The jam! The jam! By order of the King.
The jam. Let me have it!
Somebody's head is going to roll for this!
- Aha!
- The mushroom.
Off with her h-
Oh, pooh. I'm not afraid of you.
Why, you're nothing but a pack of cards.
Rule 42: "All persons more than a mile high... must leave the court immediately. "
I am not a mile high.
And I'm not leaving.
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.
And as for you,
Your Majesty-
Your Majesty indeed.
Why, you're not a queen.
You're just a, a fat, pompous, bad-tempered, old ty- tyrant.
And, uh, what were you saying, my dear?
Well, she simply said that you're a fat, pompous, bad-tempered, old tyrant.
Off with her head!
You heard what
Her Majesty said.
Off with her head.
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Here we go again
No one ever loses and no one can ever win
Backward, forward, outward, inward bottom to the top
- Never let the-
- Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Just a moment! You can't leave a tea party without having a cup of tea, you know.
- But I can't stop now.
- Ah, but we insist.
You must join us in a cup of tea.
Off with her head!
Mr Caterpillar, what will I do?
Who are you?
There she goes.
Don't let her get away!
Off with her head!
Oh! Still locked, you know.
But the Queen!
I simply must get out!
- But you are outside.
- What?
See for yourself.
Why- Why, that's me!
- I'm asleep.
- Don't let her get away!
- Off with her head!
- Alice, wake up. Please wake up, Alice!
- Alice! Please wake up, Alice!
- Off with her head!
Alice! Alice. Alice.
Alice. Alice.
Will you kindly pay attention and recite your lesson?
Hmm? Oh. Oh! Uh, how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail?
- And pour the waters of the-
- Alice, what are you talking about?
Oh. I'm sorry. But you see, the caterpillar said-
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Alice, I- Oh, well.
Come along. It's time for tea.
Alice in Wonderland

My talons are upon you!
Your days of terrorizing the owl kingdoms are over!
Not so fast! You're no match for my army of Evil Ones.
Ha, ha! Well, perhaps.
- But I am Lyze of Kiel.
- Soren, but...
And I have assembled my own army, the Guardians of Ga'Hoole!
But, Soren...
We've sworn an oath to make strong the weak, mend the broken, and vanquish evil!
Eglantine, what is it?
Soren, this time you said
I would be Lyze of Kiel.
Oh, come on. Look, next go, all right?
Well, I hope you're not lying...
...to Metal Beak!
Got you!
My beak. Da.
Okay. Enough, young owlets.
Time for bed.
Yes, please.
Enough stories about the Guardians.
Now, Kludd, stories are part of our culture and our history.
We learn from them.
Even after the 7ooth time we hear them?
Yes, even then. Unless, son, you already know all there is of our history.
I know the Guardians win.
- Soren, iùs just a story.
- It is not!
Here we go again.
I mean, Da, have you ever seen a Guardian?
Kludd, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it isn't real.
Iùs like feeling something with your gizzard.
You know, through our gizzards...
...the voices of the ages whisper to us and tell us whaùs right.
Now, thaùs enough for one night, dear.
Tomorrow's a big day.
Iùs first branching.
- Now, off to bed.
- Now, come along, children.
I've made the moss and down extra soft for you, Eglantine.
Soren, do you really think
Metal Beak is real?
You remember, it was the Battle of the Ice claws.
The Guardians were outnumbered.
Things looked dark.
But then Lyze of Kiel...
...struck down the leader of the evil owls.
The Guardians were victorious.
The owl kingdoms were free once more.
And then they returned home, to the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole.
Wow.
But some say the evil king still lives...
...and wears a metal mask to hide his missing beak.
Stop! You're gonna give her daymares.
But this is my favorite part.
I know. We've heard it a thousand times.
You have a soft head, Soren.
I think Da has filled it with stories and dreams.
There's nothing wrong with dreams.
Thaùs the difference between us.
I have mine when I'm asleep.
Now would you just go to sleep?
Soren...
...Da says our dreams are who we are.
- So as I was... Kludd, wait!
- No!
Look, Da!
I'm gonna be the best flier.
Thaùs because Tytos are best at everything.
Right, Da?
You have strength, Kludd. But owls make the best hunters for one reason alone.
Yeah, I know. Their silent flight.
By the time I have my claws out...
The mice will have run away. And you and your hatchlings will go hungry.
Da!
I'm ready.
Young Guardian...
...I don't think your first branching lesson will be that dangerous.
Now, don't worry how much noise you make in the beginning.
You just need to stretch your...
...wings.
Well done.
Beginner's luck.
You know, Kludd, it helps when
I picture where I'm gonna land.
Come on, I'll race you!
Okay. Go!
Yeah, you had a head start.
- No, I didn't!
- Yeah, you did. Da, he cheated.
Boys. No more fighting.
- Leùs get the boys inside. Iùs time to go.
- Can we come with you on the hunt?
Not tonight. But when the time comes, at least you'll have the helmet for it.
- Nice helmet.
- Get off!
Boys.
Do it again. Say it again.
Noctus, I know Soren's a bit of a dreamer.
Do you worry for him?
I worry for both of them.
Seems like yesterday they were hatchlings...
...and now, well, you know, they'll soon be grown and leaving the hollow.
I just want them to be prepared.
They'll be fine.
Come on.
Eglantine, are you all right?
Oh, iùs all right, dear.
If it wants to come out, let it.
Thaùs it, dear. Thaùs it. Keep going.
Oh, iùs going to be beautiful!
- There you go.
- Eg, hat is gross!
Quite an achievement.
- What is it?
- Iùs your first pellet.
First? You mean there'll be more?
Don't you recognize it, Eg?
It was the mouse you ate.
Its fur and bones, anyway.
Every owl yarps up pellets.
In fact, I think I might have your brothers' first pellets.
- No, no.
- Maybe you'd like to see them?
- No. Oh, Mrs. P, not again. Please.
- Oh, come on, dear.
Such a big night for this tree.
First branching, first pellet.
Excuse me.
Kludd, do you want to go out and try some more branching?
What? So you can go out there and show off again?
I don't think so.
Oh, maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just...
...I don't know, stay inside and play Battle of the Ice claws again.
Kludd? Could I just show you how?
Without you being so angry?
All right. Show me how.
Well, before I leap...
I picture myself standing on a great cliff with the Guardians, ready for battle.
We leap down, floating silently like Lyze of Kiel.
- The air's just carrying us as we...
- Thaùs enough!
Kludd, are you okay?
Oh, no.
We're on the ground.
We can't be here. Iùs... Iùs...
This is the worst place for an owl.
Yeah. No, no. Iùs weird down here.
No. We gotta get back. We can't be here.
You know, if we could just make it to that branch.
Then we could climb our way up.
Yeah, here, leùs see.
Shh! Quiet!
What was that?
Soren!
Kludd!
Kludd! Kludd!
Where are you taking us?
But our home's that way.
You can't do this!
Keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it for you.
- Whaùd you think, Jutt?
- The "I'll shut it for you" part?
No, not that. My evil stare.
Been working on it for weeks.
Oh. I missed it. Leùs see.
Lmpressive.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
You know, your evil stare reminds me a little of my "Intimidator."
Yeah?
I raise one eyebrow...
...tuck in my chin and...
- Who are you?
- Hey! No questions.
No "whos," no "whats," no "whys."
You'll see soon enough.
What do you think?
Did that evil stare seem forced or natural?
- Completely natural.
- Oh, thanks.
Let me go!
Kludd!
- Strong beak, that one.
- Yeah? Well, they'll put that to good use.
You know, Jatt, if I use your evil stare...
...and combine it with my raised-eyebrow look...
...I get this.
- What do you call that?
- "The Predator."
"The Predator"?
Iùs a bit silly, don't you think?
Hey, Jatt, look. Iùs Grimble.
Perfect. Hit him with the new look.
With or without raised eyebrow?
With raised eyebrow.
With raised eyebrow.
Greetings, Grimble.
Jutt, Jatt, so nice to see you both.
Did you only get half an owl tonight,
Grimble?
No, Jatt. Iùs an elf owl.
They're very small, but hard workers.
Too old to carry a full-size one?
Yeah, hilarious.
Is there something wrong with your face, Jutt?
Huh? No!
You've upset him now.
Iùs a new look!
But you gotta work on your comebacks.
I'm Soren.
I'm Gylfie.
He said you were an elf owl.
From Kuneer. Thaùs in the desert.
Are you a Tyto?
Yeah, from Tyto Forest.
Who are these owls?
Do you have any idea where they're taking us?
Hey! Stop talking.
Quiet! Listen to the old man!
Kludd!
- Settle down.
- Silence!
- Kludd!
- Silence!
Your parents and families have abandoned you.
So from now, you'll be classified as orphans.
No, I'm not an orphan.
Horribly tragic, I know.
But by the mercy of Glaux...
...you've been rescued and brought here to St. Aegolius.
And, in time, you'll come to be grateful for the kindness shown to you.
You'll repay that kindness with labor.
Some of you will be pickers.
No, I don't want to be a picker!
- Some will be soldiers.
- Gylfie, stay with me.
In your ways, all will serve the High Tyto and the Pure Ones.
- Let us go!
- Silence.
We don't want to serve the Pure Ones.
- Who are the Pure Ones?
- Silence!
I am Nyra,
Ablah General of St. Aegolius...
...and mate to the Lord High Tyto.
I know right now you miss your families...
...but soon enough you will understand the Pure Ones are your new family.
The Pure Ones are not our family.
Let us go!
She's right. Let us go!
Whaùs this?
Tyto, don't waste your time.
Don't soil your feathers.
You leave her be.
Oh, spirited little Tyto. How touching.
You and your patch of felt will stay together, then.
As pickers.
Leùs go. Hurry up.
Perhaps when you remember your nobility,
Tyto, we can make a soldier of you.
- Come on.
- What about my brother?
- Oh? Where's he?
- Kludd!
Owlet, that one says you're his brother.
Would you like to join him?
I didn't think so.
Kludd?
Here we go. Move along. Move it along.
- Kludd!
- Now, there's a soldier.
Thank you.
Soren, you know, you don't have to be here with me. You should be with your brother.
No, Gylfie. I could never be with those Tytos.
I don't know why Kludd would even think...
Hey! Whaùs wrong with him?
He looks like he's been moon...
All right, you owlets, move it in, move it in. Come on!
Do exactly as he says or you'll never see the light of dawn.
- Nice one, Jutt.
- Felt a little forced.
- It was awesome.
- Thank you, Jatt.
So tonight, we want you to...
- What was it again, Jatt?
- To rest.
To rest.
So lean back, put your beaks up...
...and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon.
And sleep.
Soren, we mustn't fall asleep.
I think they're trying to moon blink us.
Moon blink us?
Sometimes in the desert, owls would get exhausted and collapse under it.
When they woke up, they just weren't the same.
As if they'd forgotten who they were.
Gylfie, we are going to get out of here.
I know these stars.
I could get us away from here...
...but the only way out is to fly and we can't.
Not yet, we can't.
But we're gonna learn how.
Whenever they're not watching...
...every chance we get, we're gonna stretch out our wings...
Do you really think that we can make it, Soren?
Together, Gylfie, we'll get away.
I'm cold.
Together.
All right, my lovely little owlets.
Thaùs enough beauty rest.
Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine.
Iùs another glorious day...
- Oh, no.
- Soren.
Thaùs right. Here we go.
Move it along.
Soren.
Where are we going now?
Gylfie, we need to act moon blinked.
Keep moving.
Lots of pellet picking ahead.
You may have noticed that we don't like dawdling.
Anything with W's in it, we don't trust.
Come on.
Shuffle those talons.
The sooner you get there, the sooner we start.
The sooner you start, the sooner we finish. Leùs go!
Keep moving, no dawdling.
And welcome to the Pelletorium.
Iùs a great place for the rest of your lives.
You mustn't feel sorry for them down there.
As lower species, they are fortunate to serve a higher cause.
As Tyto owls, their natural superiors...
...you too are part of that plan.
One that will soon bring order to all the owl kingdoms...
...when the Pure Ones will rule.
A new and noble era will dawn.
Now, prove your greatness...
...and rise.
Higher!
Higher!
Leùs get this party started!
Leùs get picking!
Start picking up those pellets right now.
Thaùs right. Think of the joy. Pellets.
We love them.
Ugh. Other owls' pellets.
You know, maybe it would have been better if we had been moon blinked.
Oh, here we go.
Eureka.
Great job, number 857... Whatever.
All right, everyone, gather around.
- Hey, you with the blank expression.
Thaùs all of them.
Oh. Pay attention. He's talking.
Now this is the kind of pellet you're picking for.
Mouse fur, mouse bones, thaùs all standard.
But the secret rare ingredient in this one is what Mr. Mouse ate:
- A metal fleck.
- Metal fleck.
Now, I'm very perceptive.
- He is.
- I am.
- And I'm detecting you...
Nicely done.
...want to volunteer to take this fleck to where all the flecks belong.
You all watching? Hm?
Come on.
Soren.
Ha, ha. All right, more baskets to fill.
Back to work.
What happened?
Listen, Gylfie, those birds are doing something terribly wrong.
We have to find Kludd and we have to get out of here.
And exactly what do you two think you're doing?
Eh?
Once we have amassed enough flecks...
...we will set a trap.
Then it is up to you to lure our enemy to their rightful place:
Into our claws.
And then the Western Kingdoms and the Tree, those will be mine.
You have my word.
What do you plan on doing with us?
Quiet!
What is this place?
Get inside.
Stop asking questions.
The Pure Ones won't be too happy if you don't let us get to the Pelletorium.
No.
And they won't be too happy when they find out what I'm gonna do to you either.
I'm gonna teach you to fly.
Fly?
You can breathe now.
Yeah, iùs been getting worse here.
I told myself if any came who were smart, and brave enough to resist...
...l'd help them.
I guess you two'll have to do.
But aren't you a...?
A Pure One? No, I hate them.
Almost as much as I hate what they've turned me into.
My feathers weren't always stained with these colors.
When the Pure Ones invaded our kingdom,
I fought back.
Now, they thought they could use that...
...so they took my family.
And they promised me if I followed orders, no harm would come to them.
And I've been doing their dirty work ever since.
Now, have you flown at all before?
Well, I have been branching.
You don't have the luxury of gliding down from a nest anymore.
We need to work on your power skills, starting with what you already know.
Show me what you can do.
Come on.
Hey, good, good.
Now, try and feel every muscle, every feather in each stroke.
And push!
Ow!
All right, you two, thaùs enough. Come on.
Back to practice.
Now, the best of you...
...the fittest and the most brilliant...
...I will present to the Lord High Tyto.
So leùs see how much you've improved...
...as fliers, as fighters.
Well?
Well done. You've shown exceptional obedience and discipline.
My husband will be most pleased by your progress.
Hm. Tell me, does your brother have similar potential as a flier?
Who, Soren?
No. He fell out of the tree when he was still a hatchling. He's lame.
Oh, soldier, you mustn't confuse praise for license.
Never lie to me.
For the Lord High Tyto, we need as many strong fliers as we can find.
Come, leùs tell your brother what rewards there are...
...for those who recognize their true family.
No, more flap, deeper flap.
The still air has no shape to use.
You gotta compensate with your downstroke.
Make your wing tips almost meet, if you can, without stalling.
I can't curl my feathers enough, Grimble.
My wings are too short.
Well, they said Lyze of Kiel's wings were short.
And that didn't stop him.
And you're gonna need to fly a long way to get to the Guardians.
- The Guardians of Ga'Hoole?
- Yeah.
But how will we know where to go?
Well, you have to get to the Sea of Hoolemere...
...yeah, where the Tree is shrouded in ancient mists...
"Which keep it hidden from all but the strong of purpose and the true of heart."
Yeah, exactly.
I'd come with you...
...but I still hold out the hope of freeing my family.
Really?
- Kludd.
- Go!
Kludd, come with us!
Go, now!
Get them!
- Kludd!
- Your little owlets won't get away.
Soren! What do we do?
Soren, we have to go!
Wait. Kludd! Come on!
Now's our chance!
Well, what are you waiting for, son?
This is your chance to go home!
I am.
I am home.
- Eh?
- No.
Would you wound your queen, Grimble?
You're not my queen!
We need to jump now, Soren!
- Now! Aah!
Aah!
Come on, Gylfie! Flap!
Flap your wings!
No! Follow the owlets!
Follow the owlets!
Go, you fools!
Go! Go tell the Guardians!
Look! There! I see a way!
Where? Aah!
Gylfie, come on, follow me!
Faster, Gylfie. Come on! Faster!
I can't, Soren, I just can't.
I have to rest.
No, Gylfie. Come on, we have to!
Hey, wait. I think they're gone.
What? Are you sure?
I think so.
Hey, you know what?
What?
We're flying.
Does it feel the way you thought it would?
No.
It feels much better.
What are we gonna do now, Soren?
We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.
Grimble's death was unfortunate.
But you...
You had a chance to follow your brother, yet you didn't.
I'm starting to think that you might actually deserve to stay.
To be one of us.
Oh, I want that.
We offer power and purpose.
What can you offer us?
What can you offer me?
I...
- I have a sister.
- Go on.
She's young, but she's got spirit...
...and will grow into a strong Tyto.
Perhaps you could bring her to me.
Here the young ones are our future.
Are you hungry?
Why?
Watch this.
Hey! Oh, nice hunting.
You should be really proud of yourself...
...catching a moth thaùs already caught.
Wait. You hadn't caught it.
Mm! I was very close.
One might even say I was this close:
<u><b>Extracted from DVD by
ForsakeN</u></b>
- Perfect.
Ahem.
An ambush.
Well, I bet you didn't count on this.
I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to take your moth.
- It wasn't his moth.
Yes, it was.
We were just looking for a place to hide and rest.
- In which order?
What do you mean?
Did you need to hide first or rest first?
What difference does it make?
Huge! If you need to hide first,
I'd say you were in big trouble.
But if resting was on your mind,
I'd say your situation wasn't as dire.
We're on our way to the Sea of Hoolemere.
We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.
Really?
Two little owlets like you will never reach the sea.
There are some really scary beasts out that way.
Scary beasts?
If the hawks don't make a quick lunch of you, then the buzzards will.
And if the buzzards don't get you...
...the dingoes wait in the trees and as you fly by they...
Our request remains the same, owl.
Do you have a place to rest?
My frienÔs hurt.
Name's Digger.
The hollow's this way.
Going to the sea, huh?
Yeah.
You know what they call owls who fly towards the sea?
- Uh, no.
- Lost.
Iùs hilarious. I have another one for you.
What do you call an owl...?
Twilight! We've got company!
Put me down this instant! I mean it!
This is highly disrespectful!
Dinner is served.
And she will not stop talking.
Mrs. P! Iùs me, Soren!
Soren!
Oh, it can't be.
Every day, I've been looking for you and Kludd, and then this.
To be snatched up by this monstrosity.
Monstro...? The audacity!
Digger, who are these tiny owls and why are they talking to dinner?
My name is not "dinner."
Well, dinner's rather moody, isn't it?
Wait. She is not dinner.
She's my nursemaid.
I just hate being driven to hiss.
So unladylike.
Indeed.
Mrs. P, these are my new friends.
This is Gylfie and Digger.
And Twilight, is it?
Charmed to meet you, dinner.
Oh, I mean, Mrs. P.
These two are going to the Sea of Hoolemere...
...to find the Guardians.
- Really?
What?
No, Soren, we need to get you home.
Your parents are so worried.
No, you don't understand, Mrs. P.
Kludd and I were kidnapped.
- Mercy!
- He's still held captive.
I have to find the Guardians.
They're the only ones that can save him.
An adventure afoot!
Danger. Intrigue.
The stuff of songs.
Oh, no. Not the lute.
But such things have no effect on me...
...for I am a poet as much as a warrior.
If you will...
Though his nursemaid tels him no
The boy will not be tamed
He flies off into danger
To be battered, bruised and maimed
Just because iùs sung doesn't make it a song.
That poem just came to me, if you can believe it.
- I think they can believe it.
- Iùs a gift.
Right, well, sounds like we've got a long journey, so...
Mrs. P?
Look, you know iùs what
Da would want.
Thaùs just why I'm coming with you.
What? No! Please do not leave us here.
Yes, you're the first new souls we've seen in eight moons.
If I have to hear any more of his ridiculous owl jokes...
- They're a hoot!
- They are not.
Well, if I have to hear him play one more quote-unquote "song"...
...l'm gonna tear my gizzard out!
How dare you?!
Leùs get out.
Please. Please don't go!
Do you even know the way to the Sea of Hoolemere?
- Twilight knows the way.
- Of course I know the way.
We are off to the Sea of Hooladance.
- Iùs "Hoolemere."
- Hoolemere.
Hey, you know, Mrs. P, you might be the first snake ever to fly.
You know, I think I am.
And I quite like it too.
Oh, my!
Shove it.
- My lord.
Hm?
Our work at St. Aegolius is very nearly done.
The last of the flecks are on their way.
And I've brought you an offering with beating hearts.
Your new soldiers. Tested and pure.
One in particular shows exceptional promise.
I'll be the judge of that.
You. Soldier.
Step forward.
Yes, you're right to be afraid in my presence.
What is your name?
- Kludd.
Speak up.
Ahem. Kludd! My name is Kludd.
There. Thaùs better.
Remember, weakness is for the lower species...
...never for us.
Do you know why, Kludd?
Because we are Tytos.
Oh, I got another one.
- Knock, knock.
Please don't respond.
Who's there?
Don't encourage him.
Owls.
Owls who?
Here it comes.
Ha, thaùs right. Owls whoo!
I told you.
Because owls whoo. Funny.
Absolutely pathetic.
Iùs a very complex one, but iùs...
As the night falls, so do we
we fall asleep
we fall asleep
We continue to fall asleep
we fall asleep
For dreams, they come on highly
Shh! Shh!
We are now asleep
we are now asleep
You know,
I think that crow is following us.
Yes. I've had my eye on him for a while.
Know what an owl says when he's pecked by a crow?
Really, Digger, must you?
Ow!
- Thaùs right, "Ow"!
Hey! Get out of here!
Oh, that is it.
Twilight! Your lute!
Oh, let them have it. Good riddance.
- Oh, wait. Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!
Mrs. P!
Come on!
Mrs. P! I'm coming!
Soren, look!
Help!
They're too fast.
I'll get you closer.
We're going to lock talons!
What?
- Trust me! I know what I'm doing!
Yeah, but have you done this before?
No, but I've always wanted to try it!
Hold on!
Mrs. P!
Get out of here! Begone!
Oh, Mrs. P. Are you okay?
Quite a ride.
Leùs do that again.
Owl, you surely can fly.
Thank you, Twilight.
Well, here we are.
The Sea of Hoolemere.
Iùs just so big.
Yes, iùs a right big puddle there.
I don't know.
You really think the Guardians are out there?
They have to be.
The band!
- Finally.
- Who's there?
Your arrival 'twas foretold.
'Twas foretold trespassers would land on my shore.
Look, we mean you no harm.
Yes. 'Twas foretold as well.
- We've flown a long way.
- Also foretold.
- And we're very tired.
- Foretold!
I know all.
Now, state your desire, owl.
- Well...
- Wait.
If you really know all, then how come you don't know that?
Ah! 'Twas foretold there would be one who doubts.
Is anyone else having trouble with this?
Yes, I kind of am.
Da said, "guided by the spines of the echidna."
Wait! Wait, you're an echidna!
I am the echidna.
And it was foretold you would need some help getting here.
Well, then, I should tell you, we seek the Guardians.
He should already know that.
I do, doubter. Go on.
Da said your spines can guide us.
And they will.
Now, to reach the Tree, keep between the Whale's Fin and the Eye of Glaux.
Never go outside those stars.
Now, go! All of you.
'Twas foretold that the band would hesitate.
But that in time would become a family.
And a family needs all of its members to play their parts.
The warrior.
Poet warrior, please. Thank you.
Fine, strong and noble.
The tracker, sturdy and faithful.
The navigator, who doubts.
The leader, whose gizzard is strong.
And finally, of course, the heart.
Wait. Are you a snake?
Yes, I am.
You've all come this far, each protecting the other.
So go. Look to the sky, and fly.
All right. Leùs go.
Remember, when your wings are weak...
...your spirits done...
...and you've flown as far as you can...
...you're halfway there!
What did he say?
We're halfway there! Oh, yeah.
Woo-hoo! This is gonna be a breeze.
We're lost!
I can't find my bearings.
We have to find the island!
We're in the mist.
The Tree must be on the other side.
I can feel it in my gizzard!
Your gizzard?
Does anyone else have any more solid information about how much further it is?
Digger, why are you flying like that?
Like what? You know how I fly.
Iùs not that!
Digger! Your wings!
I think...
Goodbye.
- Digger.
- Digger!
Aah! Digger!
Digger? Digger.
Oh, no. No.
Can you fly with me?
There are...
There are five of us.
Yes. We know.
Can you see whaùs happening?
Out of my way, I can't see.
I can't hear a thing.
Shh!
I wanna see!
I'm concerned about this fleck material of which they speak.
It could be a weapon.
Could be a new shield or armor.
Having examined them, Your Majesty...
...they do show signs of the trials they described.
It beggars belief to think that these brave owlets would fly here by themselves...
...to spin a fairy tale.
Heh-heh-heh.
- Does my Lord Allomere feel otherwise?
Oh, good Glaux.
Boron, Your Majesty, if I understand this correctly...
...Metal Beak is not a myth...
...he's building a slave army of moon-blinked owlets...
...and is planning to conquer the world with magical pellet debris.
Without intending any disrespect...
...and particularly to my little friends, who have been through so much...
...such a story simply stretches plausibility too far.
Does that notion strike Ezylryb as amusing?
What cheek!
Whaùs amusing to me is that you would cover yourself by besmirching these fliers.
Perhaps my good fellow Ezylryb wishes us to race back to war.
No, no.
Perhaps he'd write a poem about it from his hollow, while the rest of us...
Well, while the rest of us had our talons deformed too.
But I say caution...
...when the losses could be so many.
I would never counsel rushing blindly into war...
...but for a cause such as the one the boy described...
...for a violation of peace so blatant, so powerful...
...of course I'd fight!
What other course to take?
And if you think I'm a coward, or I'd simply urge others on, I'll fight you right now.
Order.
- Boron, you can judge the winner.
Mildly, owls.
We're trying to seek the truth.
The truth?
I told you the truth.
The Pure Ones exist.
They've kidnapped me and dozens of owlets from our hollows.
They want to enslave us all and rule our world without pity.
Yes, the only proof I have are my words.
But words were the only proof I ever had that you were real.
And still, I believed.
And you would argue with that?
I will not argue with it.
Your Majesty, my search and rescue chaw...
...is scheduled to leave on a routine survey during the next full moon.
No.
- Perhaps we could...
You shall leave immediately.
Take your best owls with you, Allomere.
And be thorough.
Wow.
Soren, we did it.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.
I just hope Allomere finds the owlets.
Oh, to be a young owl with a taste for adventure...
...arriving to the Tree for the first time.
Well done to hold your own in there.
Some more nice strong gizzards.
The Tree always needs them.
He is one strange owl.
I think he might be missing a few talons.
And a good bath.
Gross old owl.
You'll want to stay out of his chaw.
- Chaw?
- I'll tell you on the way to dinner.
You're already late.
Look out!
Now, Matron's instructed me to give you lot a rundown on the way we do things here.
During your basic training...
Wait, wait, wait. Basic training?
You don't just become a Guardian overnight. It takes years. Years.
- Hello.
Only our absolute best...
...are chosen to be...
- Wait. Who are you?
Are you going to keep interrupting me?
Now, if, however unlikely, you do have talent...
...you'll be tapped, or selected, for a specialized chaw, or squadron.
There's navigation, healing, search and rescue...
...blacksmithing, weather interpretation, colliering.
I expect to be placed in the navigation chaw myself.
Name's Otulissa, by the way.
I'm... I'm Soren. Heh.
I believe your friends are in there.
Digger! Hi!
How's the food, Digger?
He said "good," but he thinks iùll go better with a little music.
- What?
- And this looks like a decent crowd.
He's actually pretty good, you know.
Oh, I guess. If you like that sort of thing.
Here at the Great Tree...
...every owl trains in different skills we call "chaws."
You'll study tracking...
...navigating, combat.
But maybe you're a blacksmith.
Here I come, here I come.
Digger!
Ow! Hey! Hold it!
Hang on, hang on. Ow!
Fire, boy. Iùs the lifeblood of the Tree.
There's nothing more dangerous. Hm?
Owls.
You must be joking.
Preposterous!
Come back here! I wasn't ready.
Feel the air!
Follow me.
My soldiers, my sons...
...many of you have heard of me in late-night whisperings...
...but I assure you, I am not a myth.
I am real.
And I stand before you with one simple truth:
The strong shall rule the weak.
Long ago, I was viciously attacked by the coward Lyze of Kiel...
...for defending that truth.
Now I wear this mask to conceal my scars.
But the metal is strong.
It is a symbol of the Pure Ones' strength and resolve.
It is time to set a fire that will consume the owl kingdoms...
...and take back what is rightfully ours!
Because we are Tytos!
We are Pure Ones!
And I am Metal Beak!
Metal Beak. Metal Beak.
Metal Beak. Metal Beak.
- Kludd?
- Metal Beak.
- Kludd.
- Metal Beak.
I miss Ma and Da.
I'm scared.
Don't be. You're with me now.
Eglantine, this is our home.
They really appreciate us here.
Kludd, please, could we just go find Soren?
Hey, hey! Forget about Soren.
Soren's weak. We're Tytos.
Pure Ones.
Kludd, I promise I won't tell anyone what you're doing.
I just wanna go home.
All right, Eg.
So we could go? When?
Tomorrow.
But first, tonight...
...just sleep.
Doing some wee-hours reading, eh?
Yeah. Iùs the Battle of the Ice claws.
You know, this is my da's favorite story.
He used to tell it to us all the time.
Well, your da had good taste in authors.
You enjoying it?
Honestly, iùs not at all like my da told it.
No? How did he tell it?
Well, Da always made it seem so heroic.
You know? Like a great victory.
Well, in these chronicles, I mean, the battle just sounds like...
Like hell?
Come on, boy. Iùs almost first light.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
I'm going to teach you how to really fly.
Feel the gutters! The currents in the rain.
A scupper!
A swillage!
Baggywrinkles!
"Baggywrinkles"?
He could have at least given us a vocabulary list.
Now, this, this is the way to learn!
Oh, yes! This is exactly how
I want to learn.
In a monsoon!
The air currents warm in different ways, you see...
...from the sky to the ocean.
You can't fight them.
You have to feel them with your gizzards.
Aha! You see that one?
Soren, see it! Iùs there.
Go for it.
Thaùs it! Use your gizzard, boy.
Trust it!
Fly inside.
He sees it.
He sees it.
Hold it. Hold it.
Soren. Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, careful, look out!
Soren!
Soren!
Owl, come to my hollow.
So lean back, put your beaks up...
...and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon...
...and sleep.
Lord Allomere, the boy was right.
Those owlets, we have to rescue them.
Caution. We mustn't rush in blindly.
We don't know what we're up against.
Now, see those bats?
Follow them. I'll wager we'll discover the full extent of their plan.
Hold!
I'll take out that one, you get the two down on the platform.
What is this?
I don't even know what I did with it.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what I did. What did I do?
We flew a great way out here and it was nothing like that.
You've got no reason to worry, boy.
I confess, I guided you into that twister on purpose.
I wanted to test your gizzard.
You were exemplary.
"Exemplary"?
No, no, no.
I nearly had my wings ripped off.
You know, my head said to do one thing while my gizzard was saying to do another.
And you trusted your head.
Thaùs when you failed.
Wait. Is that your mark?
EzYLRYB:
What, this? Yes.
So you wrote the
Chronicle of the Battle of the ice Claws.
I think so.
Well, actually, yes. I did.
- Were you there?
- Yes.
What, as a scribe?
Well, no. As a soldier.
As the, I guess you could say, leader of all the soldiers.
You're Lyze of Kiel.
Um... Yes.
You're Lyze of Kiel.
Yes. Don't wear it out.
But...
That old thing?
Thaùs only good for gathering coals now.
Yeah, but why go by Ezylryb?
All the owls of the Tree know who I am.
But you're...
My days as Lyze are well behind me.
And that battle is a distant memory.
Except, funnily enough, for young owlets like you.
Why didn't you tell me?
What difference does it make what I call myself?
Because Lyze of Kiel was my hero.
Yes, well, fancy it must be hard meeting your hero...
...and seeing that he's real and not a myth.
You're just not...
What did you expect?
Some Tyto alba with gleaming armor and battle claws, the moon rising behind him?
Well, this is what it looks like when you've actually fought in battle.
Iùs not glorious, iùs not beautiful.
And iùs not even heroic.
Iùs merely doing whaùs right.
And doing it again and again, even if someday, you look like this.
Something's wrong.
Downed owlets, downed owlets!
- Come fast!
Allomere is back!
Quickly.
Make way.
Some help here.
These owlets need attention.
Fetch it, quick.
- Mommy?
- Iùs okay.
Hey. Hey. What happened?
Lord Allomere rescued two owlets in the Beaks.
It looks like he's hurt.
I think he ran into some of your Pure Ones.
You know, I didn't really believe you before.
Oh, well, thaùs okay. You know,
I wouldn't have believed me either.
Soren! Soren, come fast, iùs Eglantine.
Eglantine?
Let me through! Let me pass!
Been moon blinked.
No.
Do you think you can help her?
We will do our best, Soren.
Eglantine.
Eglantine.
The battle was ferocious.
We were greatly outnumbered.
I was only lightly wounded, thank Glaux.
But the others...
Can you estimate the number of enslaved owlets, Allomere?
Scores, that I witnessed.
There may well be many more.
And you believe this is part of a larger plan.
It is certain.
Your Majesty, this is no time for half measures.
Hmm.
Bubo, sharpen the battle claws.
To arms.
To arms.
Not a bad fit.
Ezylryb! Lyze.
Yes to both.
Look, I have to go.
You have to take me with you.
Oh, absolutely.
An untrained youth like you could last a whole minute in a real battle.
Here.
Come along.
We could use the talon fodder.
I'd love to throw some bodies at the enemy.
Yeah, but I'm...
Or you could stay here...
...tend to your sister...
...and do some real good.
But what do I know?
I'm just a tired old screech.
Move.
Oh, Eglantine.
I'd trade places with you if I could.
I really would.
You know, I wish it was me lying there instead of you.
Oh, Soren.
Because then you could see this place for yourself, Eg.
You know, Da's stories, they're true.
They're all true.
You know, the Guardians, and the Ga'Hoole Tree, and...
Iùs all true
Even Lyze of Kiel. I mean, he's real, Eg.
He's real.
Soren, you promised.
Eg?
You promised I could be Lyze on the next go.
- Oh, Eglantine.
- Oh, Eglantine.
Eglantine.
Soren? Mrs. P?
We're... We're not at home, are we?
We're at the Guardian's Tree, Eg.
Look. Look, this is Ga'Hoole.
No, it can't be. Kludd, he's still...
Kludd was wrong. Da was right.
He was right all along, Eg.
No, I mean Kludd was there. With me.
He did this to me, Soren.
He's one of them.
He what?
No. No, Eg.
Look, you must be confused.
That can't be.
Well, thank Glaux Allomere rescued you.
I wasn't rescued.
Kludd gave me to the owl who brought me here.
No, Eg, no. Thaùs impossible.
I mean, that would mean that Allomere would have to be a...
Be a traitor.
No, iùs a trap.
Allomere!
Allomere!
We'll follow the Whale's Fin.
Iùs how they would have gone.
I see something.
There.
We should check out that smoke.
Soren, look.
Oh, Allomere.
Is it different when you see the consequences of your betrayal?
- Must it be bats that bleed them?
- Of course.
They have no gizzards to be impaired by the power of the flecks.
Now, my love?
It would be cruel to make them wait any longer.
Finish them.
Well, we can't just leave them down there, writhing in pain.
- Can we?
- No, you don't understand.
When we were at St. Aggie's, we saw what those things can do.
They do something terrible to your gizzard. Isn't that right, Soren?
Soren?
Uh, we've got bats inbound.
Not to worry. I can down a hundred of those bloodsuckers.
Uh... Ooh. How about a thousand?
Well, we won't find out sitting on our tail feathers, will we? Come on!
Wait! Just wait.
- Of course.
- Soren, what is it?
The flames. Thaùs it.
I think I see a way to free the Guardians.
No, Soren, you can't fly into fire.
Listen, Gylfie, I need to trust my gizzard.
Twilight, can you take care of the bats?
Friend, I'll give you as much time as I can.
But hurry. And be careful.
Come on!
Twilight, I think if we're going into battle together...
...you'll have to sing your best battle song ever.
- What?
- No, I'm serious. I want to hear one.
Give us your bravest, most inspiring battle song ever!
Brilliant idea, Digger!
Into battle we do fly
Yeah, thaùs it!
No matter if we're going to die
What? Is that supposed to be inspiring?
- Wait! We haven't gotten to the best bit!
- Oh.
A nasty, scary death that hurts quite a lot
Even if our wlngs are ripped clean off
No. No!
You told us you'd bring all the Guardians.
But they're not Guardians.
Soren.
They have no chance against the flecks.
Still, I don't think we can trust you anymore, Allomere.
No.
No, no, you promised me.
You promised me I would be
King of the Tree!
You should know, Allomere...
...there is only room for one king.
Hey!
Fly away!
Use your glizzard, boy!
Fly inside.
Soren!
No!
Oh, Soren.
Come on, Soren.
That was exemplary.
But we're not finished yet, boy.
Oh, yeah! Woo-hoo!
Come on.
I bet you didn't count on this.
Ha, ha! Good job, my friends!
Pure Ones, attack!
Crush them!
Before they can recover!
Guardians, we must uphold our oath.
To battle!
I need you to stay here with your friends...
...and guard these owlets.
- Huh?
Unh! Ha, ha!
Come on!
Kludd?
No.
Soren!
Kludd!
Hello, brother.
Hmm?
Well, the legendary Lyze of Kiel.
Once again, iùs come down to just you and me.
And now I can take my vengeance for this.
You should thank me.
It appears to be an improvement.
Your precious Guardians are finished, Soren.
The Pure Ones will triumph...
...and Tytos will take their rightful place as rulers of the owl kingdoms.
Oh, iùs gonna be glorious!
"Glorious"?
No, the Pure Ones are monsters.
You saw what they were doing.
They were moon blinking other owls and turning them into slaves.
You're just weak, Soren.
Still living in your dreams.
No, my dreams are what make me strong, Kludd.
- They led me to the Guardians.
- Ha-ha-ha.
A pity there won't be any Guardians left after today.
I don't understand.
How could you join the Pure Ones after what they did to us?
"What they did to us"?
They believe in me like no one else ever has.
Metal Beak says the strong will triumph...
...the broken are put out of their misery.
And honor...
...honor is just another word for weakness!
No, Kludd!
I know you don't really think that.
Then you don't know me at all.
Soren! My wing's broken! Help me up!
Soren, I'm your brother.
Kludd, no!
Metal Beak.
Be done with it, then.
No!
I'm not letting you hurt one more soul.
Oh, you're not letting me?
Oh, what a pity to waste...
...such a strong, young and confident Tyto.
No, Soren!
Oh. You know this sad old owl.
He's my teacher. My hero.
Well, your hero can teach you one last lesson about Pure Ones' strength...
Don't move.
...by letting you watch him die.
Hmm.
Unh!
Ha, ha.
Pure Ones! Fall back!
To me!
Soren, you did what was right.
And you did it well.
It seems we will have to amend the Chronicles. Huh?
As it was in the old ages...
...so it was in the new.
The Guardians upheld their oath that night.
I foretold you so!
They made strong the weak and mended the broken.
And when the sun shone again that morning...
...all could see that they had vanquished the evil.
Soren! Soren!
- Oh, Eg.
- Ha, ha!
Are there any casualties?
- We're so proud of you.
- Ha, ha!
- Da, the stories...
- Ha, ha.
...they're real.
You made them real, Soren.
With the peace restored...
...it was a time for celebration...
...and recognition that our small band of owls...
...who fate and a storm had blown into the Tree...
...now stood before its king and queen as young Guardians.
Eady finally, with all their hearts...
...to take that ancient oath:
To mend those who are broken...
...to make strong the weak...
...and, without hesitation...
...vanquish the evil.
For as we know...
...Nyra escaped.
And Kludd?
Well, Kiudd was never found.
Should I stop?
What? Please, don't stop.
I don't wanna give anyone daymares.
Oh, come on.
There must be more, there must be.
Ha, ha. Listen to them, Soren.
They want more stories.
Well, come on, you lot.
Leùs not disappoint them.
Ah. There's a good storm brewing.
And if we're lucky, iùll be chock full of baggywrinkles.

All right, everyone! This is a stickup!
Don't anybody move!
Now empty that safe.
- Money, money, money!
- Stop it! Stop it, you mean old potato.
Quiet, Bo Peep, or your sheep get run over!
Help! Baa! Help us!
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody, do something!
Reach for the sky.
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.
- How'd you know it was me?
- Are you gonna come quietly?
You can't touch me, Sheriff.
I brought my attack dog with the built-in force field.
Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs.
- Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart.
Say good-bye to the wife and tater tots.
You saved the day again, Woody.
You're my favorite deputy.
# You've got a friend in me #
Come on, let's wrangle up the cattle.
# When the road looks rough ahead #
# And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed #
Round 'em up, cowboy.
# Just remember what your old pal said #
# Boy, you've got a friend in me #
Yee-haw!
# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #
Hey, cowboy!
# Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am #
# Big and stronger too #
Come on, Woody.
# Maybe #
# But none of them will ever love you the way I do #
# It's me and you, boy #
# And as the years go by #
# Our friendship will never die #
# You're gonna see it's our destiny #
# You've got a friend in me #
All right!
# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #
Score!
# You've got a friend in me #
Wow! Cool!
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!
Okay, birthday boy.
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so...
- Oh, my gosh, you got...
- One, two... four.
Yeah,
I think that's going to be enough.
- Can we leave this up 'til we move?
- Well, sure.
- We can leave it up.
- Yeah!
Now go get Molly.
Your friends are gonna be here any minute.
- Okay!
- It's party time, Woody.
Yee-haw!
Howdy, little lady.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
Come on, Molly.
Oh, you're getting heavy.
See you later, Woody!
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?
Okay, everybody, coast is clear!
Ages three and up.
It's on my box.
<b>"Ages three and up."</b>
I'm not supposed to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.
Hey, Hamm, look.
I'm Picasso!
- I don't get it.
- You uncultured swine.
What are you looking at, ya hockey puck?
- Uh, hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!
Okay. Hey, thank you.
At ease.
- Hey, uh, Slinky?
- Right here, Woody. I-I'm red this time.
No, S-Slink...
Oh, well, all right.
You can be red if you want.
N-Not now, Slink.
I got some bad news.
- Bad news?
- Shh, shh, shh!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting, and be happy.
Got it.
Be happy!
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium, please.
Hey, Etch. Draw!
Oh! Got me again.
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.
Uh, got a staff meeting, you guys. Come on, let's go.
Now, where is that... Oh.
Hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here?
- Uh, how're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
Oh, I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it!
I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
Ow! Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.
What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Oh, yeah.
I...
Remember, I'm just a couple of blocks away.
Come on, come on.
Smaller toys up front.
Hey, Woody, come on.
Oh, thanks, Mike.
Okay... Oh, whoa. Step back.
- For crying out loud.
- Okay. Thank you.
Hello. Check.
That better? Great.
Everybody hear me?
Up on the shelf, can you hear me? Great.
Okay, first item today: uh, oh, yeah... has everyone picked a moving buddy?
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.
Well, I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.
Do we have to hold hands?
- Oh, yeah.
- You guys think this is a big joke.
We've only got one week left before the move.
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.
If you don't have one, get one!
All right, next.
Uh, oh, yes.
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion awareness meeting... was, I think, a big success, and we want to thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us.
- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
You're welcome.
Okay. Uh, oh, yes.
One, uh, minor note here.
Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.
Uh, next we have...
- Wait a minute.
What do you mean the party's today?
- His birthday's not 'til next week!
- What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?
Well, obviously, she wanted to have the party before the move.
- I'm not worried.
- You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried.
He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten.
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, Potato Head.
If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me.
Woody has never steered us wrong before.
Come on, guys. Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur, a mean one?
I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!
Hey, listen.
No one's getting replaced.
This is Andy we're talking about.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.
What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.
That's what we're made for, right?
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but they're here!
- Birthday guests at three o'clock!
- Stay calm, everyone!
Hey!
Uh, meeting adjourned.
Ho, boy, will you take a look at all those presents?
I can't see a thing.
Yes, sir. We're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.
- They're all in boxes, you idiot.
- They're getting bigger!
Wait, there's a nice little one over there.
Hi!
 Spell: trash can.
- We're doomed!
All right. All right!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.
Eh, very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.
Sergeant, establish a recon post downstairs. Code Red!
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!
Repeat: we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!
Let's move, move, move, move, move!
Okay. Come on, kids.
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.
All right, gangway, gangway.
And this is how we find out... what is in those presents.
Okay! Who's hungry?
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch and barbecue! Ow!
What in the world? Oh!
I thought I told him to pick these up.
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.
Come on. They're not lying down on the job.
G-Go on without me.
Just go.
A good soldier never leaves a man behind.
Okay, everybody.
Come on.
Settle down. Now, kids.
Everybody... You sit in a circle.
No, Andy. Andy, you sit in the middle there.
Good. And which present are you gonna open first?
There they are.
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.
- This is it! This is it!
- Come in, Mother Bird.
- Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- All right
Andy's opening the first present now.
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!
- Hey, I can dream, can't I?
- The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.
It's a... It's... It's a...
A lunch box.
We've got a lunch box here.
A lunch box?
- A lunch box?
- For the lunch.
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...
- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?
Oh! Only one left.
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!
It's a big one. It's a...
It's a board game! Repeat: Battleship.
- Yay!
- Hallelujah!
- Yeah, all right.
- Hey! Watch it!
Sorry there, old spud head.
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.
So did I tell you? Huh?
Nothin' to worry about.
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted you for a second.
Wait a minute.
Oh, what do we have here? Ohh!
Wait!
Turn that thing back on!
Come in, Mother Bird.
Come in, Mother Bird.
Mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet.
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.
- Mom! What is it?
- It's a huge package.
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids is in the way. I can't see.
It's a...
It's a what?
What is it?
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!
Now we'll never know what it is!
Way to go, Rex!
- No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!
Oh, he's puttin'
'em in backwards.
You're... You're puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Let's go to my room, guys!
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!
- There!
- Juvenile intrusion. 
Repeat, resume your positions now!
Andy's coming, everybody!
Back to your places! Hurry!
Get to your places!
Get to your places!
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come! Ohh!
Hey, look!
Its lasers light up.
- Take that, Zurg!
- Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.
And he does it back, and he does a karate-chop action.
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!
- We got prizes!
- Oh, yeah!
- What is it?
- Can you see it?
What the heck is up there?
Woody, who's up there with ya?
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Uh, nothin'.
Uh, nothin'.
I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.
Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.
It's just a mistake!
Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody.
- Oh! Have you been replaced?
- Hey, what did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there... a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
Come in, Star Command.
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?
Why don't they answer?
My ship!
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.
Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4-0-7-2.
My ship has run off course en route to sector 12.
I've crash-landed on a strange planet.
The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep.
Terrain seems a bit unstable.
No readout yet if the air is breathable.
And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.
Hello!
Whoa! He-Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Did I frighten you?
Didn't mean to. Sorry.
Howdy. My name is Woody... and this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.
And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up.
This is my spot, see... the bed here.
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.
My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed here is my spot.
I need to repair my turbo boosters.
Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystallic fusion?
Well, let's see.
We got double-A's.
- Watch yourself! Halt! Who goes there?
- Don't shoot!
- It's okay. Friends.
- Do you know these life-forms?
Yes. They're Andy's toys.
All right, everyone.
You're clear to come up.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!
All right, thank you.
Now, thank you all for your kind welcome.
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.
- Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
- Wow!
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string, only it's...
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
- Oh, yeah, but not like this one.
This is a quality sound system.
Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong?
Well, no. Actually, l-I'm...
I'm stationed up in the
Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.
As a member of the elite Universe
Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,
I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion... from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.
I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout.
You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before.
Well, sure, look at him. He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Please be careful.
You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
Hey, a laser! How come you don't have a laser, Woody?
It's not a laser. It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.
All right, that's enough!
Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy.
- Toy?
- T-O-Y. TOY!
Excuse me. l-I think the word you're searching for is "Space Ranger".
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't ya?
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear, uh, now, I'm curious.
What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or... or shoot lasers or fly!
Excuse me.
- Wow!
- Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!
Oh, what? What? These are plastic.
He can't fly.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I can fly.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.
- You can't.
- Can.
Can't. Can't. Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
All right, then, I will.
Stand back, everyone.
To infinity and beyond!
- Can!
- Whoa!
Oh, wow! You flew magnificently!
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you.
That wasn't flying.
That was falling with style.
Man, the dolls must really go for you.
Can you teach me that?
- Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!
No, in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see.
They'll see. I'm still
Andy's favorite toy.
# I was on top of the world #
# livin' high #
# It was right in my pocket #
Whoa!
# I was livin'the life #
# Things were just the way they should be #
# When from out of the sky like a bomb #
# Comes some little punk in a rocket #
# Now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to me #
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
# Strange things #
# Are happening to me #
# Strange things #
# Strange things #
# Are happening to me #
# Ain't no doubt about it #
# I had friends
I had lots of friends #
# Now all my friends are gone #
# And I'm doin' the best I can #
# To carry on #
# I had power #
# Power #
# I was respected #
# Respected #
# But not anymore #
# And I've lost the love of the one #
# Whom I adore #
# Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange things #
# Are happening to me #
# Strange things #
# Strange things #
# Are happening to me #
# Ain't no doubt about it #
# Strange things #
# Strange things #
Oh! Finally.
- Hey, who's got my hat?
- Look, I'm Woody. Howdy, howdy, howdy.
Ah-ha. Ah-ha!
Give me that!
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog, let me show you something.
It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture.
Your chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me.
Wow! With permanent ink too!
Well, I must get back to repairing my ship.
- Don't let it get to you, Woody.
- Uh, let what?
I don't, uh...
What do you mean? Who?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know he'll always have a special place for you.
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right! That's it!
- Unidirectional bonding strip.
- Mr. Lightyear wants more tape.
Listen, Light Snack, you stay away from Andy.
He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?
And another thing:
Stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Oh-ho-ho! Okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?
The air isn't toxic.
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!
My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets.
You actually think you're The Buzz Lightyear?
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!
- You're mocking me, aren't you?
- Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
- Buzz, look! An alien!
- Where?
Yes!
Whoa!
- Uh-oh.
- It's Sid!
- Don't move!
- I thought he was at summer camp.
They, uh, must have kicked him out early this year.
Oh, no, not Sid!
Incoming!
- Who is it this time?
- Uh, I can't... I can't tell.
- Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again.
- Stay where you are!
- Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.
- What's going on?
- Nothing that concerns you spacemen
Just us toys.
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
That's why... Sid.
- Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow.
- No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.
That is Sid.
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.
He tortures toys, just for fun!
Well, then, we've got to do something.
- What are you doing?
- Get down from there!
I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
Yeah, sure. You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that.
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes! He's gone!
He's history!
I could've stopped him.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.
- Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater.
- Yeah!
- The sooner we move, the better.
- Oh, what a great shot. Yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.
What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!
Go wash your hands, and I'll get Molly ready.
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.
- Just one?
- One toy?
Will Andy pick me?
"Don't count on it"?
Ohh!
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear!
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!
We've got trouble!
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.
A helpless toy!
It's... It's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose.
- I don't see anything.
- Uh, he's there.
Just... Just keep looking.
What kind of toy...
- Buzz!
- Buzz!
Buzz!
- I don't see him in the driveway.
- Did you see what happened?
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Ohh! Buzz!
Hey, everyone! R.C.'s trying to say something. What is it, boy?
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- Huh?
- What do you mean?
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed.
- No!
- By Woody!
- What?
- What?
Wait a minute.
You... You don't think
I meant to knock Buzz out the window,
Do you?
Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.
Now, you... you gotta believe me.
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?
Well, ye... n...
I don't like confrontations.
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!
You don't deserve to... Hey!
You couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could you, Woody?
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy.
So you got rid of him.
Well, what if Andy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?
You're gonna knock me out of the window too?
- I don't think we should give him the chance.
- There he is, men.
- Frag him!
- Let's string him up by his pull string!
- I've got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it?
- Tackle him!
- No, no, no! W-W-Wait!
Boys, stop it!
- I can explain everything.
- Okay, Mom, be right down.
- I've gotta get Buzz.
- Retreat!
- Mom, do you know where Buzz is?
- No, I haven't seen him.
Psst!
Andy, I'm heading out the door!
- But, Mom, I can't find him!
- Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on.
Okay.
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!
Buzz, the monkeys aren't working.
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!
Oh, where could he be?
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.
Yuk, yuk, yuk.
Funny, Mom.
Oh, great. How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
Buzz!
Buzz! Hah! You're alive!
This is great! Oh, I'm saved!
I'm saved! Andy will find you here.
He'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone... that this was all just a big mistake.
Huh? Right? Buddy?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
- Oh. Oh, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet.
- Are we?
- No.
Okay. Come on!
You want a piece of me?
Ow!
Buzz... Buzz... Buzz
Lightyear to the rescue.
- Ouch!
- Next stop...
- Pizza Planet. Yeah!
Andy!
Wh... Doesn't he realize that I'm not there?
I'm lost!
Oh, I'm a lost toy!
Buzz Lightyear mission log.
The local sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort.
You!
- According to my navi-computer, the...
- Shut up!
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is the perfect time to panic!
I'm lost! Andy is gone!
They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault!
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...
Oh, yeah? Well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship... and taken away everything that was important to me...
Don't talk to me about importance.
Because of you, the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
What? What are you talking about?
Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy,
Emperor Zurg has been secretly building... a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet!
I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.
And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!
You are a toy!
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear!
You're a... Uh, you're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity. Farewell.
Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony.
"Rendezvous with Star Command."
- Hey, gas dude!
- You talking to me?
- Pizza Planet?
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- D'you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
- Andy!
- Just a moment.
- Oh, no!
I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away.
No, Buzz, you gotta come back! l...
I found a spaceship!
It's a spaceship, Buzz.
Come on, man, hurry up! Um, like, the pizzas are getting cold here.
- Oh, yeah, Cutting Boulevard.
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?
Now, you're sure this space freighter will return... to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home.
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait! Buzz! Buzz!
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.
Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, but...
- Buzz! Buzz!
- That's two lefts and a right, huh?
- Yeah.
- Uh, thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah, remember, kid...
- Buzz!
"It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay." What an idiot.
Next shuttle lift off scheduled for T-minus 30 minutes and counting.
You are cleared to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
The white zone is for eating pizza...
- Sheriff!
Sheriff? There you are.
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.
Great idea, Woody.
I like your thinkin'.
You are cleared to enter.
- Welcome to Pizza Planet.
- Now!
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.
Jones, party of five, your shuttle is now boarding...
Mom, can we have some tokens?
- Ow! Watch where you're going!
- Sorry!
Nine, Eight, Seven, Six,
Five, Four, Three,
Two, One.
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.
- Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please!
- Andy!
- Oh, it's so cool!
Now, we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12.
Wait a minute. No, no, no, Buzz.
This way! There's a special ship. I just saw it.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyperactive hyperdrive and Astro, uh, turf!
- Where is it? l-I don't see the...
- Come on. That's it.
Spaceship!
All right, Buzz, get ready. And...
Until the universe explodes!
Okay, Buzz, when I say go, we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!
- Hey, Mom, if I eat all of my pizza,
- No!
Can I have some alien slime?
This cannot be happening to me!
- A stranger.
- From the outside. Ooh!
Greetings.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
- I come in peace.
- Tell me what it's like outside.
Before your space journey, re-energize yourself with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.
This is an intergalactic emergency.
I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12.
Who's in charge here?
The claw!
The claw is our master.
- The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?
Take that!
Oh, no! Sid!
Get down!
- What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I wa...
- You are the one...
- That decided to climb into this...
- Shh! The claw.
It moves.
I have been chosen!
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.
Gotcha!
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!
- Yes!
- Buzz! No!
Hey!
- He has been chosen.
- He must go. Hey!
- You might anger the claw.
- What are you doing? Stop it!
- The claw! The claw!
- Stop it, you zealots!
- Do not fight the claw.
All right!
Double prizes!
Let's go home and play.
Sheriff, I can see your dwelling from here. You're almost home.
Nirvana is coming.
The mystic portal awaits.
Will you be quiet?
You guys don't get it, do you?
Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out!
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!
Sit! Good boy.
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!
Ready, set, now!
Hannah! Hey, Hannah!
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I don't know.
- Oh, no, Hannah!
- What?
Look... Janie!
Hey!
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!
- I'll have to perform one of my operations.
- No!
- Not Sid's room. Not there.
- No!
Sid, give her back!
Sid!
- Oh, no! - Mom!
- We have a sick patient here, Nurse.
Prepare the O.R., stat!
Patient is prepped.
No one's ever attempted a double bypass... brain transplant before.
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!
I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.
Doctor, you've done it!
Hannah!
Janie's all better now.
- Mom! Mom!
- She's lying!
Whatever she says, it's not true!
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!
Locked!
There's gotta be another way outta here.
Uh, Buzz, was that you?
Hey, hi there, little fella.
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?
Bu-Bu-Bu-Buzz!
They're cannibals.
Mayday, mayday. Come in,
Star Command. Send reinforcements.
Star Command, do you copy?
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Ah, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.
Hey, you guys, I think
I found him. Buzz, is that you?
Whiskers, will you get out of here!
You're interfering with a search and rescue!
Look! They're home.
- Mom, have you seen Woody?
- Where was the last place you left him?
- Right here in the van.
- I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone!
- Woody's gone?
- Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.
Oh, a survivor!
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!
I can see your will is strong.
Well, we have ways of making you talk.
Where are your rebel friends now?
- Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!
- All right!
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.
A lesser man would've talked under such torture.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the spaceport.
The door. It's open!
We're free!
- Woody, we don't know what's out there!
- I'll tell you wha...
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something, quick!
Shield your eyes!
It's not working. I recharged it before I left. l-It should be good for...
You idiot, you're a toy!
Use your karate-chop action!
Get away!
Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?
Stop that!
- Back! Back, you savages! Back!
- Woody, stop it.
Sorry, guys, but dinner's cancelled.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home!
Another stunt like that, cowboy, and you're gonna get us killed.
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Shh!
Yee-haw! Giddyap, partner!
We got to get this wagon train a-movin'!
Split up!
Calling Buzz Lightyear. Come in,
Buzz Lightyear. This is Star Command.
- Buzz Lightyear, Star Command!
- do you read me?
Buzz Lightyear responding.
Read you loud and clear.
Buzz Lightyear, planet Earth needs your help!
- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!
The world's greatest superhero, now the world's greatest toy!
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!
- Calling Buzz Lightyear!
- Karate-chop action!
- Wow!
- Pulsating laser light!
- Total annihilation!

Mom! Mom, have you seen my Sally doll?
What, dear?
What was that?
Never mind!
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?
 There's a secret mission in uncharted space. Let's go.
Really? That is so interesting.
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?
Buzz!
It's so nice you could join us on such late notice.
- Oh, no.
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.
It goes quite well with your head.
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.
I'll be right back.
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?
Buzz! Hey! Buzz, are you okay?
Gone! It's all gone.
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. Whoo-whoo. See ya.
- What happened to you?
- One minute you're defending the whole galaxy, and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling... with Marie Antoinette and her little sister.
I think you've had enough tea for today.
- Let's get you outta here, Buzz.
- Don't you get it?
You see the hat?
I am Mrs. Nesbitt!
Snap out of it, Buzz! l-l-I'm... I'm sorry, l...
You're right.
I am just a little depressed, that's all. l... l-I can get through this.
- Oh, I'm a sham!
- Shh!
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz!
I can't even fly out of a window.
But the hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.
- The apron is a bit much.
- Out the window!
Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, come on. This way.
Years of academy training wasted!
- B-3.
- Miss! G-6.
Ohh! You sunk it!
- Are you peeking?
- Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.
Give me the nose. Come on.
How about three out of five?
Hey, guys! Guys!
- Hey!
- Son of a building block!
- It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.
- H-H-Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!
- Woody?
- You're kidding!
Woody!
We're gonna get out of here, Buzz.
Buzz?
- Hey, look!
- Woody!
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you guys!
- I knew you'd come back, Woody!
- What are you doin' over there?
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.
Here! Catch this!
Whoa! I got it, Woody!
- He got it, Woody!
- Good goin', Slink!
- Now just, just tie it on to somethin'.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I got a better idea.
How about we don't?
Hey!
- Potato Head!
- Did you all take stupid pills this morning?
Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?
And now you want to let him back over here?
No! No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
You got it...
You got it all wrong,
Potato Head.
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here. He's with me.
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not!
Buzz, come over here and j-just tell the nice toys that you're... that you're not dead.
Just a sec! Buzz, will you get up here and give me a hand?
That's very funny, Buzz.
This is serious!
Hey, Woody, where'd ya go?
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.
Oh, hi, Buzz. Why don't you say hello to the guys over there?
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!
Hey, look! It's Buzz!
Yeah! Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys our new secret best-friends handshake.
- Give me five, man!
- Something's screwy here.
So you see, we're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz?
You bet. Give me a hug.
- Oh, I love you too.
- See? It is Buzz.
- Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
- Wait just a minute.
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothin'.
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!
- It's not what you think, I swear!
- Save it for the jury!
I hope Sid pulls your voice box out, you creep.
No! No! No, no! Don't leave!
Don't leave! Y-Ya gotta help us, please!
- You don't know what it's like over here!
- Come on, let's get out of here.
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.
Come back! Slink!
Slink, please!
Please listen to me!
No! No, come back!
Slinky!
Buzz!
Go away, you disgusting freaks!
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!
He is still alive and you're... you're not gonna get him, you monsters!
What are you doin'?
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.
But... But they're cannibals.
We saw them eat those other toys.
Uh, sorry. l-l-I thought that you were gonna, you kn... you know, eat my friend.
Hey, no, no. Hey. Hey!
What's wrong?
- Sid!
- Not now, Mom! I'm busy!
Sid!
Buzz, come on, get up!
Use your legs!
Fine! Let Sid trash you!
But don't blame me!
It came! It finally came!
"The Big One."
"Extremely dangerous.
Keep out of reach of children."
Cool! What am I gonna blow?
Man! Hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll?
Yes.
I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit.
Yes.
Oh, no!
Oh, man!
Sid Phillips reporting.
Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site.
Tomorrow's forecast? Sunny.
Sweet dreams.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
W-What if we leave them behind?
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'm sure we'll find Woody and
Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
- I need air.
- Will you quit moving around?
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.
How did I get stuck with you as a moving buddy?
Everyone else was picked.
Oh, Woody.
If only you could see how much Andy misses you.
Psst! Psst! Hey, Buzz!
Hey. Get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me.
Oh, come on, Buzz, l...
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me out of here.
And then I'll get that rocket off you and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.
Y-You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time
I am thinking clearly.
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.
I'm just a toy.
A stupid little insignificant toy.
Whoa. Hey.
Wait a minute.
Being a toy is a lot better than being a, a Space Ranger.
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.
Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal.
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.
- But why would Andy want me?
- Why would Andy want you?
Look at you!
You're a Buzz Lightyear!
Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.
You've got wings!
You glow in the dark! You talk!
Your helmet does that... that... that "whoosh" thing.
You are a cool toy.
As a matter of fact, you're too cool.
I mean... I mean, what chance does a toy like me have... against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?
All I can do is...
There's a snake in my boots!
Why would Andy ever want to play with me when he's got you?
I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.
Listen, Buzz, forget about me. You should get out of here while you can.
- Buzz, what are you doin'? I thought you...
- Come on, Sheriff.
There's a kid over in that house who needs us.
Now let's get you out of this thing.
- Hit it!
- Yes, sir!
Come on, Buzz, we can do it.
- Woody! It's the moving van!
- We gotta get out of here now.
Come on, Buzz.
All right.
- Buzz. Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.
I wanna ride the pony.
Whew.
Woody. Woody, are you all right?
No, I'm fine. I'm okay.
Oh, yeah!
Time for liftoff! Whoo!
To infinity and beyond!
Whoo-hoo!
Back! Back!
Down! Down!
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody, think.
Guys!
No, no, no, no, wait!
Wait. Listen. Please!
There's a good toy down there and he's... he's gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes, all because of me.
We gotta save him.
But I need your help.
Please. He's my friend.
He's the only one I've got.
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.
We're going to have to break a few rules, but if it works it'll help everybody.
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.
Launchpad is being constructed.
All right, listen up.
I need Pump Boy here.
Ducky, here. Legs?
You're with Ducky.
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?
Okay. Let's move!
Wind the frog!
Wait for the signal.
Go!
All right, let's go!
I'll get it!
Now!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Whoa! Scud!
Stupid dog.
Lean back!
Uh, Mission Control, is the launchpad construction complete?
Uh, roger. Rocket is now secured to guide wire.
We are currently obtaining the ignition sticks.
Countdown will commence momentarily.
Stand by.
Let's go.
Hey, Mom!
Where are the matches?
- Oh, wait, here they are. Never mind!
- Woody! Great!
- Help me out of this thing.
- Shh!
- What?
- It's okay. Everything's under control.
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Houston, all systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch.
Hey. How'd you get out here?
Oh, well. You and I can have a cookout later.
Houston, do we have permission to launch?
Uh, roger. Permission granted.
You are confirmed at T-minus ten seconds... and counting.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one...
Reach for the sky.
- Huh?
- This town ain't big enough for the two of us.
What?
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
- It's busted.
- Who are you calling "busted,"buster?
- Huh?
- That's right.
- I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.
- Huh?
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid.
- Or smashed. Or ripped apart.
- We?
That's right. Your toys.
Mama! Mama!
Mama! Mama!
Mama!
From now on you must take good care of your toys,
because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid.
We toys can see everything.
So play nice.
We did it! We did it! Yes!
The toys! The toys are alive!
N-Nice toy.
What's wrong, Sid? Don't you want to play with Sally?
Nice work, fellas. Good job.
Coming out of the ground... what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.
Woody.
Thanks.
Everybody say, "Bye, House!"
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, House.
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!
Quick!
Just go! I'll catch up!
Come on!
You can do it, Woody!
I made it.
Ow! Get away, you stupid dog!
Down! Down!
Hold on, Woody!
I can't do it.
Take care of Andy for me!
No!
Buzz!
- Ow!
- Are we there already?
- Woody?
- Woody!
- How did you...
- How'd he get here?
- Where have you... What happened... Ow!
- What's goin' on?
- What's the... What's he takin'?
- Aha! There you are!
Hey, what's he doing?
He's at it again!
- Get him!
- Come on!
Get him!
Aah! Aah! No! No!
No, no, no, no, wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Pig pile!
- Get out of that car!
- Move it!
- Whew.
- No, please! You don't understand!
Buzz is out there!
We gotta help him!
- Toss him overboard!
- No, no, no, no! Wait! Aaah!
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!
- Ohh, Woody!
- Ohh!
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride!
- Look out! Aaaah!
Now let's catch up to that truck!
- Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.!
- What?
And Buzz is with him!
- Ohh!
- What? Buzz?
It is Buzz!
Woody was telling the truth!
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt!
We're almost there!
- Rocky, the ramp!
- Come on, Woody, Buzz! You can do it!
Look out!
Quick! Hold on to my tail!
Atta boy, Slink!
Uhh! Woody!
- Woody, speed up!
- Speed up!
The batteries!
They're running out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!
- Aaaah!
# Hakuna Matata
# What a wonderful phrase
I can't hold on much longer!
Slink, hang on!
Ouch!
Great.
- Woody! The rocket!
- The match!
Yes! Thank you, Sid!
No! No, no! No!
No!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No!
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz.
You did it! Next stop, Andy.
Wait a minute.
I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!
I should've held on longer.
Look! Look! It's Woody and Buzz coming up fast!
Woody!
Run! Take cover!
Aah! This is the part where we blow up!
Not today.
Hey, Buzz! You're flying!
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.
To infinity and beyond!
Uh, Buzz, we missed the truck.
We're not aiming for the truck.
- Hey! Wow!
- What? What is it?
Woody!
Buzz!
Oh, great! You found 'em.
Where were they?
- Here in the car!
- See?
Now, what did I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.
- Frankincense, this is Myrrh.
- Hey, heads up, everybody!
- It's show time!
- Oh! It's time!
Oh. Bo. There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
- Say, isn't that mistletoe?
- Mm-hmm.
Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur, like a leaf eater.
That way I could play the, uh, dominant predator!
- Quiet, everyone, quiet.
- Molly's first present is...
Mrs. Potato Head!
Repeat, a Mrs. Potato Head!
- Way to go, Idaho!
- Gee, I'd better shave.
Come in, Frankincense. Andy is now opening his first present. It's...
- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear.
- I can't quite...
- You are not worried, are you?
- Me? No.
- make out...
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Mm-mmm.
A large box.
It's, it's, it's...
- Are you?
- Oh, now, Buzz.
What could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?
Oh, what is it? What is it?
Wow! A puppy!

Make mine music
Make mine music
And my heart will sing
Make mine music
And it's always spring
All the world goes romancing
When melody fills the night
And even the stars go dancing
To the music of the moonlight
Make mine music
And I'll dream of you
Make mine music
And the dream comes true
Music will play the shadows away
When everything seems to go wrong
So make mine music
And life will be a song
Make mine music
Gather round me, children, and I'll tell a story
Of the mountains in the days when guns was law
When two families got disputin'
It was bound to end in shootin'
So just listen and I'll tell you what I saw
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They was reckless mountain boys
And they took up family feudin' when they'd meet
Every durn time!
They could shot each other quicker than it took your eye to flicker
They could knock a squirrel's eye out at 90 feet
All their fightin' started one bright Sunday morning
I remember!
Cos old Grandpa Coy was full of mountain dew ...
Just as quiet as a church mouse
He stole into the Martins' henhouse
Cos the Coys, they needed eggs for breakfast too
After that they started out to fight in earnest
And they scarred the mountains up with shot and shell
There was uncles, brothers, cousins
Why, they bumped them off by dozens
Just how many bit the dust is hard to tell
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They were reckless mountain boys
At the art of killin' they became quite deft
Mighty deft
They all knowed they shouldn't do it
But before they hardly knew it
On each side they only had one person left
Only one person left
Now, the sole remaining Martin was a maiden
And as pretty as a picture was this Grace
- While the one survivin' boy
- Was the handsome Henry Coy
And the folks all knew they'd soon meet face to face
- After her, Henry!
- Go get her, boy!
- Knock him off, Gracie!
- Shoot that Coy!
So they finally met upon a mountain pathway
And Henry Coy, he aimed his gun at Grace
Right at Grace
He was set to pull the trigger when he saw her pretty figure
You could see that love had kicked him in the face
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They were reckless mountain boys
But they say their ghostly cussin' gives you chills
Cos the hatchet sure was buried when sweet Grace and Henry married
It broke up the best durn feud in these here hills
Come on, everybody, let's dance!
Way down yonder, not far off, a jay bird died with the whoopin' cough
Do si do, little more dough, chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
"Granny, will your dog bite?". "No, child, no, he lost his teeth a long time ago"
Now swing your partners,
And promenade the hall,
Same old road, same old train
Watch that monkey walk that rail
Now first couple out to the right
Go round that couple and take a peek
Come back to the centre and shake your feet
Round that couple and peek once more
Back in the centre and circle four
Swing your partner and call your hound
Right foot up and left foot down
Bottom of your foot make a hole in the ground
Now you're tall with a smile
Once and a half and go hog wild
Sooey, hog, sooey!
Look at him run!
What's the hurry, Henry?
Now you may think that this is where the story ended
But I'm tellin'you them ghosts don't cuss no more
Cos since Grace and Henry wedded they fight worse than all the rest did
And they carry on the feud just like before
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
In the deep where sleepy shadows roam
While we roll, blue bayou
In your dreamy light
Memories echo in my heart tonight
I hear the echo of our song of love
Murmuring low
And here am I
Still haunted by
The ghost of long ago
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
In the deep where sleepy shadows roam
While we roll, blue bayou
In your dreamy light
Memories echo in my heart tonight
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Across the blue moon
Boy!
Hop in the old jalop and...
Head for the malted shop and...
All the cats join in
Down goes my last two bits
Comes up one banana split
And all the cats join in
Drop your jack in the old jukebox
Play your favourite disc
When you dance with the bobby socks
You dance at your own risk
RIP
Everybody swing
Yes, swing till the rafters ring
And all the cats join in
Rafters ringing, how they're swinging
All the cats join in
I'm so lonely and blue
When I'm without you
I don't know what I'd do, sweetheart.
Without you
The joy and tears that love endears
Would have no meaning
If I didn't have you
To keep me dreaming
At the close of each day
When I'm without you
And my heart kneels to pray
I pray about you
You take a star
And lead it far away from heaven
And the star will be lost
As I'm lost without you
At the close of each day
When I'm without you
And my heart kneels to pray
I pray about you
You take a star
And lead it far away from heaven
And the star will be lost
As I'm lost without you
Oh, what a lark to ride out to the park
And just to see Casey
They travelled for miles and they stand in the aisles
And just to see Casey
The ladies don't understand baseball a bit
They don't know a strike from a foul or a hit
But when they see Casey that dame has got it
Casey, the pride of them all
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day
The score was four to two
With but one inning left to play
Listen, ya bunch of bush leaguers, it's the ninth inning!
It's the wind-up! The blow-off!
Come on, unbutton your shirts!
Now get in there and fight!
Who's up next?
Cooney!
The coach was really worried when Cooney went to bat
For all he had to offer was 300 pounds of fat
Ah, but Cooney was determined, he tried to do his worst
He kept his batting average, all right
And as usual died at first
You're out!
Hooray for our side! Hooray! Hooray!
- Aw, shut up!
- Sit down!
- I'll kick the stuffin' out of him!
- Yeah, run that guy outta town!
Barrows was the next one up, and Barrows made a hit
Wow, he smacked a beauty - right in the pitcher's mitt
You're out!
A straggling few got up to go
Ah, but the loyal fans stood pat
They'd put up even money now were Casey at the bat
Ah, but Flynn preceded Casey
Of all the stupid guys
The bat is getting in his hair
Now the hair is getting in his bat
Egad! He let drive a single - much to his own surprise
Safe!
The next one in the line-up was "No Hit" Jimmy Blake
Of all the mugs in Mudville he was the biggest fake
But he was really blazing and to the wonderment of all
Blake the Fake tore the cover off the ball
And when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-huggin' third
Cosy, isn't it?
You're safe!
We want Casey! We want Casey!
We want Casey!
Oh, Casey's the guy with his eye on the ball
But mostly the ladies
Casey's the guy who's the idol of all
But mostly the ladies
Casey is mighty and manly
Casey's a dangerous gent
Egad, when he goes to bat, hang onto your hat
He's batting a thousand percent with the ladies
Oh, Casey has nerve and he knows every curve
He's no hokey-pokey
He gets away with that old double play
He's sure okey-dokey
He makes all the ladies go gaga, it's true
No wonder they swoon when he comes into view
He was the Sinatra of 1902
Casey, the pride of them all
The pitcher's nerves were jagged and his knees began to shake
Ah, can't catch me! Can't catch me!
One eye was watching Flynn and the other eye watching Blake
While the frightened pitcher ground the ball into his hip
Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye
A sneer curled Casey's lip
And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped
"That ain't my style," said Casey
Strike one!
... the umpire said
From the benches, black with people, there went up a mighty roar
Like the beating of the ocean on a stern and distant shore
Kill him! Kill the umpire!
... yelled the cutie from the stand
And it's likely they'd have killed him
Had not Casey raised his hand
With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone
He stilled the rising tumult and bade the game go on
He signalled to the pitcher and once more the spheroid flew
But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, quote:
Strike two!
Unquote.
"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered "Fraud!"
But one scornful look from Casey...
And the audience was awed
They saw his face grow stern and cold
They saw his muscles strain
And they knew that Casey would not let that ball go by again
The sneer has gone from Casey's lip
His teeth are clenched in hate
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate
And now the pitcher holds the ball
And now he lets it go
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow
Somewhere in this favoured land
The sun is shining bright
Ah, yes...
Somewhere bands are playing sweet
And somewhere hearts are light
Somewhere men are laughing
Somewhere children shout
But there is no joy in Mudville -
Mighty Casey has struck out
Casey, the pride of them all!
Whaddaya know? The game is over.
Two silhouettes
Together in the afterglow
Two silhouettes
Become as one
When lights are low
And with the night slumbering on
We'll build a dream for two
A perfect dream
Set to a theme lovely as you
Two hearts on fire
Will soon inspire
The stars to dance
The flames that stray
Will light the way
To our romance
And when I hold you in my arms
To my heart's delight
Two silhouettes will drift away into the night
Two hearts on fire
Will soon inspire
The stars to dance
The flames that stray
Will light the way
To our romance
And when I hold you in my arms
To my heart's delight
Two silhouettes
Will drift away
Into the night
Will drift away
Into the night
Now, this is the story of...
Peter and the Wolf.
As you know, in the musical score of Peter and the Wolf each character is represented by an instrument in the orchestra -
Peter by the string quartet.
The bird, whose name is Sasha, by a flute, way up high.
Sonia, the duck, by an oboe. Like this...
And here is Ivan, the cat, represented by a clarinet in a very low register.
Grandpapa is an old bassoon.
The shooting of the hunters' guns by the kettledrums.
And there is also a wolf.
Little does that wolf know what's in store for him this day.
For our hero, little Peter, armed to the teeth, is setting forth to capture him.
There seems to have been a change of plans.
For Peter's grandpapa thinks that little boys like Peter should not go out to hunt the wolf.
This is very embarrassing for a great hunter.
This is Sasha, the little bird we told you about.
Excitable little chap, isn't he?
Forgetful, too.
"Hello, Petey. Where you goin'?
Can I go, Petey? Can I?"
"Oh, boy, a gun!"
"Loaded, too. "
"Goin' hunting? Oh, that's for me!"
"Everything's OK, Petey.
Come on, let's go. "
The wolf!
But it isn't the wolf at all.
It's only Sonia the duck.
"Hello, Sonia. "
"Hello, Petey. "
Now Sonia wants to join the party.
Imagination is a wonderful thing.
But sometimes it can run away with you.
"You coward!"
Now who's this?
Oh, it can't be...
Oh, no. It's Ivan the cat.
Hello, Ivan.
Ivan's a peaceful, fun-loving sort - maybe a little shy on brains. You know the type.
Hey, look out, Sasha!
"Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!"
Oh, how can they ever get any place if they're going to fight among themselves?
Ivan, you ought to be ashamed.
"You big bully!"
"You cat in the grass!"
Come on, Sasha. Ivan's sorry.
He won't do it again.
And so, once more, our little band of intrepid hunters sets forth to find the wolf.
And they find him.
Sonia! Sonia!
Behind you! Look out!
W-O-L-F!
Oh, that wolf is everywhere!
Peter, do something!
Oh, no.
Look, Peter, why don't you...
Maybe if you could...
Then maybe, Peter... Oh, well...
Peter, don't just stand that way.
Don't stand that way, either.
Oh, Sonia!
This is no time to relax.
Poor Sonia.
Well, that's one gone.
Goodbye, Sonia.
Will this crime go unavenged?
Not if little Sasha can help it.
You beast!
Take this! And this! And this!
How do you like this, eh?
And this, eh?
How about this, eh?
Not so good, eh?
Good work, Sasha!
Trouble.
Sasha! Sasha, get up!
Get up! Get out of there!
Look out, please, for over-confidence.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
Saved!
Just when things are looking blackest...
Hark! What's that we hear?
What's this we see?
The hunters!
Misha, Yasha and Vladimir.
That's Vladimir in the middle.
Wait a minute, I'll show you.
W-O-L-F. Wolf.
Wolf?
To the rescue!
Oh, Peter, you're safe!
You've captured the wolf.
Oh, happy day!
I think I'll say that again.
Oh, happy day!
Oh, Peter, what a hero!
You too, Ivan.
Everybody's happy - except the wolf.
But little Sasha isn't happy.
He's thinking of his lost playmate, Sonia.
Sonia...
Sonia?
Sonia! Then you're not dead!
You're safe!
Oh, Sonia, this is the most wonderful, wonderful day!
The wolf is captured - Peter caught him!
One, two, three...
Johnnie Fedora met Alice Bluebonnet
In the window of a department store
'Twas love at first sight
And they promised one night
They'd be sweethearts for evermore
Johnnie would serenade Alice
Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu
He sang of a beautiful palace
Of a beautiful hatbox for two
But Johnnie Fedora lost Alice Bluebonnet
To a patron of the department store
Her beauty was sought by the girl she was bought by
For twenty-three ninety-four
Johnnie, O Johnnie
Your Alice Bluebonnet
Will always be waiting for you
So don't give up hoping
And don't give up dreaming
For true love will come smiling through
Johnnie Fedora was lonely and stranded
In the window of the department store
When, lo and behold
He was suddenly sold
And his heart became gay once more
Johnnie sang out like a robin
Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu
To strangers he'd come up a-bobbin'
"I thought you were someone I knew "
He looked for her uptown and crosstown and downtown
From the Brooklyn Bridge to the Jersey shore
It all seemed in vain
Till he heard the refrain
Of the song Alice sang of yore
Johnnie, O Johnnie!
Your Alice Bluebonnet
Will always be waiting for you
So don't give up hoping
And don't give up dreaming
For true love will come smiling through
Johnnie kept yearning, he kept on returning
To the window of the department store
His voice became hushed
He was literally crushed
And it started to rain and pour
Each place he went he kept calling
- Toora-lay
- Toora-li
- Toora-lu
- La la la
His spirits kept falling and falling
For his Alice was nowhere in view
But hey-noni-noni, an ice man found Johnnie
And he cut him to fit on his horse's ears
'Twas done without malice
For beside him was Alice
And they lived on for years and years
Giddup!
You Johnnie Fedoras
You Alice Bluebonnets
Whenever you find yourself blue
You'll find it's June in December
If you just remember
That true love will come smiling through
That true love will come smiling through
This is how it all began
Just a little back-page item about a voice that sang at sea
And then this fantastic news appeared on the front page
And then in screaming headlines
Extra! Read all about it! Paper!
A singing whale?
- Whaddaya know ?
- Imagine that
Huh! I don't believe it
I don't believe it
For who ever heard of an operatic whale?
I don't believe it
I don't believe it
And headline followed headline
Then doctors and experts
And men of anatomical biology
Debated and argued
And quoted ichthyology
Impossible! Preposterous!
We savagely deny it
Magnificent! Miraculous!
We certainly certify it
And even the great impresario
Of the Grand Opera
Raised an eyebrow
And tried and tried to figure it out
This whale, she's maybe swallowed an opera singer.
That's it! This whale, she's a-swallowed an opera singer!
I find-a the great Signor Donatelli in-a the fish market.
I discovered the great Lilli Garli in-a the honky-tonky.
Why not I find-a the opera singer in-a the belly of a whale, huh?
I do it!
Oh, get me a great big schooner and get me a good harpooner
Photographers and reporters from all the newspapers
Publicity! Publicity!
Publicity!
Publicity, yes. But to Whitey the seagull, it was opportunity - the big opportunity for his friend Willie the whale.
There was no time to lose.
He must bring these two together.
Well, there was Tetti-Tatti now.
And Tetti-Tatti was in for a wonderful surprise.
Because Willie hadn't swallowed any opera singer, he could really sing.
Listen.
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Two little chillun, lyin' in bed
One of 'em sick and the other 'most dead
Called for the doctor, the doctor said
"Feed them chillun on shortnin' bread"
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
After all these years of casting his "Shortnin' Bread" upon the waters, now at last success lay just over the waves.
Willie! Willie, look!
That's you, Willie!
He's looking for you!
It's your big opportunity.
Willie's going to be a great star.
Our Willie, going to sing grand opera.
Goodbye, my friends.
I'm off to be discovered
I'm off to be discovered
At last, the long years of patient waiting, the endless hours of faithful practice were about to be rewarded.
As Willie sped to his audition he wondered what to sing for his opening number.
What would impress this impresario?
How about a bit of Figaro?
Yes, sure, Figaro.
There she's blows! There she's blows!
Figaro.
Figaro!
Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro!
Shoot-a de whale!
Figaro!
Figaro!
Figaro!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Rescue the opera singer!
Don't-a worry, we'll a-save you!
Bravo!
Bravissimo! Bravo!
Ah, but they hadn't heard the half of it.
They hadn't even heard a third of it.
For Willie was no ordinary singing whale.
Willie could sing in three separate voices: tenor... baritone... and bass.
Why, Willie was a singing miracle.
Let-a me up! This is the mutiny!
Mamma mia!
He's-a swallowed two opera singers!
He's-a swallowed three opera singers!
Stubborn, deluded Tetti-Tatti.
For right before his very eyes was the biggest discovery in all musical history.
Just imagine, a whale singing opera on the very stage of the Met.
Bravo! Bravissimo!
Je suis Méphisto
Roi d'enfer
Je veux...
Ta vie
I got him! I got him!
Vittoria!
Now Willie will never sing at the Met.
But don't be too harsh on Tetti-Tatti.
He just didn't understand.
You see, Willie's singing was a miracle, and people aren't used to miracles.
And you, faithful little friend, don't be too sad.
Because miracles never really die, and somewhere in whatever heaven is reserved for creatures of the deep,
Willie is still singing - in a hundred voices, each more golden than before.
And he'll go on singing, amid the applause and the cheering, forever.

Ladies and gentlemen,
you are about to see
an unforgettable show:
A film destined to become immortal,
as immortal as the music
which will follow,
and which will be interpreted
through animation.
Beginning with his childhood fantasies,
the greatest ambition
that burns and swells
within the soul of every creative animator
is to illustrate music,
to give visual form and color to its notes.
With this film
we have finally succeeded
in achieving this union
of animation and classical music,
a union we are sure is destined
to live on throughout the history of film.
A new and original film that has even astonished us, the men responsible, the men who, quite modestly speaking, can be called its creators.
A film in which... in which...
A film in which you will see the music and listen to the drawings.
You might call it a film of magic, a fantasia.
Hello?
Yes. Who's speaking?
Who is this?
What do you mean, who am I?
Who is it you wish to speak to?
California?
It's Hollywood.
Hello! Yes.
What? You've already...
I don't understand. I'm sorry.
You've already done this?
Look, if this is some kind of joke,
I'm in no mood...
There must be some misunderstanding.
You're very ill-mannered.
That's right... ill-mannered and a liar!
Yes, I said you're a liar!
A liar from California!
It's nothing. They're mad.
Mad as hatters.
They insist that our film... this is all so ridiculous... was already made by a certain fellow years ago.
A certain someone by the name of Prisney or Grisney.
Some American.
In any case, before you go around opening your big mouth, see the film first!
Where were we?
Settle down now.
Damned hags!
What's this racket?
Calm down!
All right, let's go.
Hurry up! No time to lose.
The film's already started.
Run!
Move it!
Get the lead out!
Come on!
Get in the car.
It's time you earned your keep.
We haven't kept you here out of charity!
Where are our instruments?
They're already at the theater, along with your clothes.
Hold on tight when we get moving.
You wouldn't want to hurt yourself now of all times, would you?
Pisney has already done this?
Let's go!
Hiring an orchestra wasn't a problem.
But the principle challenge that remained was to secure the creative collaboration of a true artist.
A free artist.
Free of all conditioning, free of all compromise, an animator capable of independent self-expression.
How's it going?
You look more cheerful than usual.
You knew this was your big day, huh?
Tell the truth.
You knew it!
Finding the ideal artist to create
our animation was no small task.
We had to bind him...
bind him to ourselves
in a contract based on trust
and mutual respect.
Come on, now.
After five years hanging around, you can't be tired!
That's good.
On your feet.
Hurry, the orchestra's waiting.
Can't you hear it?
Let's go!
Wash your dentures if you want to play trombone.
Kick the drums, not me, thank you.
- I'll do whatever I want.
- Kick her!
If they hadn't put me in the first row,
I wouldn't have done it.
I made it clear
I wouldn't do nude scenes.
Where are you going?
The movie world is dreadful.
I've always defended my virtue.
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.
This has never been done...
Just a moment.
And so it's come! The great moment...
I said wait a minute.
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.
The only thing missing now is the orchestra conductor!
Girls, babes, beauties, let's get started with Debussy's
Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.
A wonderful piece!
There'll certainly be lots to inspire our artist's imagination as he renders this music in visual form and gives it new life.
Yes, relying on nothing more than his trusty pencil,
I'm sure he'll succeed in bringing new life... in bringing new life to this great piece of music.
The artist creates!
Ready, girls?
The Debussy piece!
Good. Really great.
Sit down or I'll hang you back on the wall!
Sit down!
I did not enjoy that.
You didn't entertain me!
Quite an afternoon, eh?
Granny!
How do you feel?
A bit scattered, maestro.
Pick up all the pieces, and don't miss any!
Cheer up!
Everything's all right.
I'm feeling a bit scattered, maestro.
How's it going, girls?
Everyone all right?
Suppose we try some simple exercises.
Stand up... and sit down.
And up... and down again.
Hey, you there.
Me?
Come with me for a minute.
Do as he says.
Come along, granny.
You look a little pale, and your reflexes are a bit impaired.
It's nothing.
You'll get over it.
It's not easy maintaining order in an orchestra.
It calls for an iron fist in a velvet -
Glove! An iron first in a velvet glove.
Girls, our second piece will be Dvorak's Slavic Dance No. 7.
Mind you, the tempo is allegro.
Poor guy hasn't even noticed yet!
Take a break, everyone!
Bohemia crystal.
Fruit, uh... exotic fruit.
Chicken.
A potato.
We're catching on fire here.
Me too!
Is it good?
So, maestro, what's next on the program?
Ravel's Bolero.
Ah, Ravel's Bolero.
And who wrote that?
Ravel.
Of course. Ravel's Bolero was written by Ravel. Who else?
Ravel's Bolero. A great piece!
Ravel, the great, uh...
French composer.
- French, right?
- Yeah.
At least on his mother's side.
His father was from Umbria.
Born in Gubbio, if I'm not mistaken.
In the very heart of Umbria.
"Bolero"is a magical word.
A fantasy of color and sound.
There are thousands of ways to describe
this great musical work.
Go over there and grab the chicken.
Go on!
...in a "bolerian" vein.
Ravel's Bolero.
We didn't come here to stuff our faces.
I think this is the end of Part One.
END OF PART ONE
PART TWO
What's that ape doing here?
There's no ape in the script.
Other animals, yes, but no ape.
Reminds me of a young man I met back in 1912, before the First World War.
They just don't make men like that anymore.
Snow in the theater.
A very bad sign.
Let me go!
This can't be happening!
What is he doing?
He's getting the women too excited!
I knew it. When I get nervous, my eye clamps shut.
The next piece is
Sibelius' Valse Triste.
And you better get it right, or I'll hang you back up on the wall.
Remember the wall?
Bravo!
What feeling!
We can't go on like this.
The pieces turn out too sad!
He has no sense of humor!
I'm gonna put him back on the wall!
He'll rot in chains!
Calm down, now!
Aren't we equally to blame?
An artist needs beauty in order to express himself best, and frankly speaking, those particular girls may not be ideal.
Nonsense! Art is art!
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.
What if we were to find him a woman?
A woman he could be with.
Then he'd really start creating.
It'd be perfect!
I'm going to find one.
Wait here.
I'll be right back.
Mr. Artist, how's it going?
You look a bit run-down.
I've got some fun for you.
I know a cozy little hideaway.
Come back here.
Get in there.
You know what we want.
Easy as falling off a log.
You get in the piano, and nature will do the rest.
Go on, now!
Hello, everyone!
Our orchestra, such as it is, the piano, and our artist.
Try to cheer him up.
Want a hand?
The next piece promises to be lively and full of spice.
A concerto by Vivaldi.
Think we're overdoing it?
Let's get him out.
Yeah, looks like they're having too much fun.
That should be enough.
Lift up the lid.
That's the snag with these old pianos.
Getting in is a breeze, but getting out can be a problem.
You better make me laugh now, or I'll tear you apart piece by piece!
He looks better already.
He'd better, or I'll see that he does!
He's much more alive.
Look at his eyes!
I'll tear them out!
You'll see.
The next piece will be fantastic!
Get ready.
Curtain!
Curtain!
I'll show you!
I'll take this pianist and throw her on your head!
I'll break every bone in your body!
It's all right!
It's nothing, nothing at all.
Just a little misunderstanding.
Let her go, will you?
A small difference of opinion.
It's absolutely nothing.
Turn the camera around.
It's nothing at all.
The next number on our program is the famous Firebird, by Igor Stravinsky.
A very famous piece.
Knock it off!
Turn the camera around.
Igor Stravinsky.
One of the most renowned...
A cascade of notes.
It's music that...
Let me go!
I don't have insurance!
Put me down!
Voilà!
Everything is just fine.
The conductor is taking just a few moments to himself, but he'll be back with us very soon.
Okay. Where's the camera?
Where is the camera?
Ah, there it is.
With that little interruption behind us, our performance will now continue with Dostoyevsky's Firebird.
As they say in English...
Which in Italian would mean...
A snake!
Stop! Where are you going?
Come back!
It's just a snake!
Stop!
We've got antidote for snake bite!
There's no problem!
We've got tons of antidote!
Damn it, you old hags! Stop!
Do you hear? Stop, I say!
Traitors!
Leaving me at a time like this.
I even have a cold.
And all because of a little snake.
Look! There's nothing left!
Everything's destroyed!
And here we are once again!
Now for a finale of a different sort, one we had planned and prepared.
One that needs neither orchestra nor conductor nor music.
I'm happy to say our artist is still here with us.
Our artist who...
What are you doing?
What the devil are you doing?
Drawing her?
What do you think you're doing?
You can't leave me here like this!
Hey, wait a second!
Wait for me!
I'm going with you!
I want to go too!
Wait!
Don't go!
How will we finish the film?
We haven't done a finale!
Wait for me!
We have to do a finale!
I have to find a good idea for a finale.
The telephone!
That's it! I'll call the archives.
Hello, Franceschini?
You have to help me find a finale!
Any finale at all.
The files are full of'em!
Bring me one right away!
A finale.
It's all over.
Ready, girls?
We've got to do Stravinsky's Firebird.
It's over with.
The finale, then.
That's all over with too.
You might as well go back down there.
We're unemployed, then.
Unemployed... until the next movie.
I've already got an idea.
A brand-new idea.
We could do a love story.
A love story?
But not the usual kind about men and women.
Lots of men with lots of women.
Wife-swapping?
No, not that same old stuff.
Something different.
I like asymmetry.
Seven men and one woman.
That'll cost a lot.
No, not at all.
We'll get little tiny men... and we'll make the woman real tall.
It'll be fantastic!
Sounds scary.
Careful.
What do you mean, scary?
Seven little workers, so you get the social context, too.
A mine! They'll work in a mine!
I can see them now, singing happily.
Have you thought of a title?
That'll be easy. Let's see.
"Sleeping Beauty."
Now, keep it under your hat or some screenwriter hack might steal the idea.
You can't trust anyone these days.
He'll change the title, play up the sex, and give it some crazy name like
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
And then we'll be screwed!

Why not call it the Big Chill or the Nippy era?
I'm just sayin', how do we know it's an Ice age?
Because of all the ice.
Well, things just got a little chillier.
Help. Help.
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin'.
But, but, but, Dad.
No buts. You can play extinction later.
OK. Come on, guys.
So, where's Eddie?
He said he was on the verge of an evolutionary breakthrough.
Really?
I'm flying.
Some breakthrough.
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.
Crazy mammoth.
Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.
It'll be quieter when you're gone.
Come on. If he wants to freeze to death, let him.
I'm up. I'm up.
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?
Where is everybody? Come on, guys, we're gonna miss the migration.
They left without me.
They do this every year.
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?
Isn't there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth?
All right, I'll just go by myself.
Sick.
Wide body, kerb it next time.
Oh, jeez. Yuck.
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?
What a mess. You rhinos have tiny brains. Did you know that?
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably didn't even know what I'm talkin' about.
Yummo.
A dandelion. Must be the last one of the season.
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.
He ruined our salad.
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...
No, no, seriously, let me take care of this. What is this?
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.
Delicious. That's good eating.
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.
Tasty, isn't it? Bon appêtit.
Now?
Now.
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.
We'll just take our furry piñata and go.
If it's not them today, it's someone else tomorrow.
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?
We'll break your neck so you don't feel a thing.
Wait a minute. I thought rhinos were vegetarians.
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.
Who says we're gonna eat him after we kill him?
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.
OK, if either of you make it across that sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.
Get him.
A dandelion?
We did it.
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?
Great. Jump on my back and relax the whole way.
- Wow, really?
- No.
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?
Isn't this great? You and me, two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.
No, you just want a bodyguard so you don't become somebody's side dish.
You're a very shrewd mammal.
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...
Stop following me.
OK, so you've got issues. You won't even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?
- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.
Especially since his daddy wiped out half our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.
An eye for an eye, don't you think?
Let's show him what happens when he messes with sabres.
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.
Phew. I'm wiped out.
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.
But with my little stick and my highly evolved brain, I shall create fire.
Fascinating.
We'll see if brains triumph over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?
Think I saw a spark.
Any chance I could squeeze in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.
You should see what they did last year.
They woke up early and tied my hands and feet and they gagged me with a field mouse, covered their tracks, went through water so I'd lose their scent, and... who needs 'em, anyway?
So what about you? You have family?
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.
Manny.
There's Diego. Fall back.
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.
You lost it?
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.
You'd better, unless you want to serve as a replacement.
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.
It had better be alive.
Can we trust you with that, Diego?
Let's go.
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you have an extra mating dance, at least pick a female with the same colour pelt. "
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go praying mantis on me. "
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.
There's plenty of Sid to go around.
Manny?
Manny?
Look at that. He's OK.
She's gone.
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.
But you can't leave him here.
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".
There never was a "we". In fact, without me, there wouldn't even be a "you".
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.
I'll return you. We don't need that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?
No, we don't.
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm gonna die.
Manny.
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.
There is no "us".
I see. Can't have one of your own, so you want to adopt.
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt your snack, but we gotta go.
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.
- Callin' me a liar?
- I didn't say that.
You were thinkin' it.
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.
Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin' for the humans, you're wastin' your time. They left.
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.
I'll help you bring it to its herd, but leave me alone after that.
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.
What are you doin'? Just drop it on the ledge.
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't spear me.
- This is a problem.
- Now what?
That's perfect.
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.
Don't you have some poor animal to disembowel?
They couldn't be far. I mean, they went this way, or this way?
You don't know much about tracking, do you?
I'm a sloth. I see a tree, eat a leaf. That's my tracking.
You didn't miss them by much.
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.
You don't need this aggravation.
Give me the baby. I can track humans down a lot faster than you.
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.
Everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side.
Unless you know how to track, you'll never reach them before snow closes the pass.
Which should be, like, tomorrow.
So, you can give that baby to me, or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?
No. The sooner we find the humans, the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face, and the baby, too.
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.
And when that day comes, I suggest you watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.
Über-tracker. Up front, where I can see you.
Help me.
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down... "
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?
So if he poops, where does it go?
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea, you're small and insignificant, and I'll pummel you if you don't.
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.
I'm gonna slip.
It's clean. Got ya!
Will you cut it out?
Do that again. He likes it.
It's makin' me feel better too.
Here, you hold it.
Turn him towards me.
Where is the baby?
There he is.
Where is the baby?
There he is.
Stop it. You're scarin' him.
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.
I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.
Enough, enough, enough.
Food.
I don't know, but I've been told
I don't know, but I've been told
End of the world be mighty cold
Prepare for the Ice age!
Protect the dodo way of life!
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!
Protect the dodo way of life!
Prepare for the Ice age!
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders. Intruder...
.. burn and die.
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...
No way. This is our private stockpile for the Ice age.
Sub arctic temperatures will force us underground for a billion years.
So you got three melons?
If you weren't smart enough to plan ahead, then doom on you.
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.
Oh, no. No.
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...
There goes our last female.
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.
The last melon.
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.
Now to find a meal befitting a conquering hero.
What ho? A foe? Come on, come on. You want a piece of me?
Spoils worthy of such a noble...
Bedtime, squirt.
The triumphant return.
Huh? Oh, that.
I'm so full. How about a good-night kiss for your big buddy, Sid?
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.
All right, good night.
Will you stop it?
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.
Oy.
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?
Tracking down helpless infants too difficult for you?
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby, or don't come back at all. "
I have a message for Soto.
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.
And tell him I'm bringing... a mammoth.
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.
This one does, and I'm leading him to Half Peak.
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack to bring this mammoth down.
Get everyone ready.
Now.
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?
Sid.
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.
Sabres were closing in on him.
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.
Yeah, well, he needed me, and I only wish I had one of my own, too.
Really? I find that attractive in a male.
Alas. Who wouldn't want a family, I always say.
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...
Hey. Hi, Manny.
What's the matter with you?
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep marinating and I'll be right back.
Sexy.
He's not much to look at, but it's so hard to find a family guy.
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.
- You have a cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.
Manny, I need him.
So, ladies, where were we?
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves like a cheetah. And that tiger...
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?
Look at you. You're gonna grow into a great predator.
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.
No fangs, no claws.
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.
What's so threatening about you?
Does this look like a petting zoo to you? Huh?
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.
You think that's funny? How about this?
You'll be a little snack for the owls.
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.
Help. Help.
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.
Help.
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.
Over here.
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.
Wait a minute.
He's dead all right.
Carnivores have all the fun.
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts like that. But you know how it is.
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.
Manny. Manny.
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.
You don't know where it's been.
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.
- I don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...
I thought you were gonna... Were you?
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on, come on. Can you wait a second, please?
Fellas.
Thanks for waiting.
Three, two, one...
Sure is faithful.
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.
Modern architecture. It'll never last.
Hiya, Manny.
Hi, Diego.
Hey, Sid.
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.
Ask him directions.
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.
Let me try. Pack.
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.
Pack of wolves? Pack of...
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.
Pack of flying fish.
Great news. I found a short cut.
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.
I know what a short cut is.
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass or we take the long way and miss 'em.
Through there? What do you take me for?
This time tomorrow, you could be a free mammoth.
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peek-a-boo.
Guys. Guys. Check this out.
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.
No, thanks. I choose life.
Then I suggest you take the short cut.
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!
Way to go, tiger.
Quick. Get inside.
OK, I vote short cut.
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.
Guys?
A fish.
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.
I gotcha.
Captain, iceberg ahead.
Oh, no.
Yeah. Who's up for round two?
Tell the kid to be more careful.
Look, look. Tigers.
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers are just playing tag with the antelope.
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.
You're it.
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloth’s?
You never see any sloth’s.
Have you ever noticed?
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.
And he's got a family.
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.
- Sid...
- Find a she-mammoth, have baby mammoths...
- Sid.
- What?
- Shut up.
- But...
Would you look at that.
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.
Next stop, Glacier Pass.
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?
You're almost home.
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a newsflash
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.
Seriously. My feet are really hot.
Tell me that was your stomach.
I'm sure it was just thunder.
From underground?
Come on, keep up with me.
I would if you were moving.
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?
Hold Pinky.
Manny.
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.
What? What? I can't hear you.
You're standing on my trunk.
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?
You could have died, trying to save me.
That's what you do in a herd.
You look out for each other.
Well, thanks.
I don't know about you guys, but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.
I can't wait to get my claws in that mammoth.
No one touches the mammoth until I get that baby.
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally tough, but extremely juicy.
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.
Mammoths don't go down easy.
There's only one way to do it.
First, you have to force it into a corner.
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,
I'll go for the throat.
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.
- How much further?
- Three miles.
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloth’s on the map.
Why don't you make it realistic and draw him lying down?
And make him rounder.
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.
I'm a genius.
From now on you'll have to refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.
Lovebirds.
Look at this.
I don't believe it.
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.
Come to Uncle Sid.
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.
No, no, no. No, go to him.
Go to him.
OK.
Good job. Keep practisin'.
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.
Look at that big pushover.
You know, Diego, I've never had a friend who would risk his life for me.
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.
Yeah, he is.
Well, good night.
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.
Diego, what do you think?
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?
Maybe because we save him, he won't hunt us.
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and a long skinny neck and call you Mama.
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.
Diego. You frozen back there?
- Get down.
- What?
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?
At the bottom of Half Peak, there's an ambush waiting for you.
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?
- You set us up.
- It was my job.
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.
No, you're not. Not yet.
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.
Trust you? Why in the world would we trust you?
Because I'm your only chance.
Hello, ladies.
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.
No need to worry. In about two minutes you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.
Very nice.
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.
Don't give away your positions until you see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.
You want to maul something, don't you?
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?
No, I said wait for the mammoth.
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!
Loop-de-loop.
Slalom! Slalom, baby!
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.
Get him.
Surprise!
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid and get outta here while we can.
Come on, Diego, let's bring this mammoth down.
There he is.
That's right. Where's the baby?
Survival of the fittest.
I don't think so. Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.
Fine. I'll take you down first.
We did it.
We were some team, huh?
Were? Come on, we're still a team.
I'm sorry I set you up.
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.
Knock it off, squirt.
You gotta be strong.
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.
Especially Sid.
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?
Come on, Diego, come on.
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.
Listen, you have to leave me here.
If those humans get through the pass, you'll never catch them.
You didn't have to do that.
That's what you do in a herd.
Don't forget about us.
OK?
We won't forget about you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Sid...
- Bye.
Bye.
That's right. Where's the baby?
Come on, Sid, let's head south.
Bye.
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.
Diego? You're OK.
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.
You're OK.
I could kiss ya.
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?
No thanks. I gotta save whatever dignity I've got left.
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.
This is gonna be the best migration ever.
I'll show you my favourite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.
- Attractive.
- This whole Ice age thing is getting old.
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.
- Keep dreamin'.
- No, really...

Gorbash! Gorbash! Come!
There was time between the waning age of enchantment
and the dawning age of logic
when dragons flew the skies.
Free and unencumbered.
Look down there Gorbash, my friend!
On that troubled earth below us, confusion and chaos reign.
All mankind is facing an epic choice.
A world of magic or a world of science.

This cannot be.
The worlds of magic and logic must exist side by side.
Not destroy each other.
Take care!
Be careful with your machines I say.
Who is making all that rumpus?
It's that balmy old gent what lives upstream.
Your motors must not crowd out all magic.
For the world is lost.
How sort of magician I hear?
I am Carolinus!
The Green Wizard.
Your loony you are. Get back to where you belong.
I belong everywhere, for my domain is the green world.
Nature itself and all its inhabitants!
Envatos... Umabella... Flamenca...
Away with your mill wheel.
A ball of blue magic to make it disappear.
Disappear say I!
Kala!
Magic he calls it.
My little boy could do better.
- Father you need rest.
- No time.
Just was not there.
I called upon magic and there was none.
Oh…
- The pain again?
- I can't let it bother me.
Have you written the messages as I asked?
Yes father, but...
Then summoned The Silver
Owls Of The Full Moon.
- But...
- Summoned them I say!
Is it true?
Did they stone you?
Well, me and young Gorbash will fix um'...
We'll burn down that mill and devour every living one of them.
That would do no good.
Just a little scared then... uh?
A short fiery blast to turn their hair white… uh?
Smrgol, please!
Father, the owls.
Smrgol, I'm summoning my brothers to a meeting.
Our first in four centuries.
Away.
Ommadon too?
The ancient laws command he be included.
Make Gorbash ready for the journey to the Temple Of All Antiquity.
I wish I could carry you, old friend.
No, you serve me well as the past.
Let young Gorbash bear your burdens now.
Father, who are these brothers?
You never spoken to me of them.
I know you are Green
Wizard Of Nature Realm.
But the others?
My brother Solarius, is the Blue Wizard.
Lord of the depths and the heights.
He's realm is outer space,
deepest ocean, highest mountain.
My brother calls council, but why?
Lunarian! Lunarian!
And my brother Lo Tae Zhao.
The Golden Wizard.
His realm is light and air.
He is lord of transcendence, healing, contemplation.
I was expecting this, it was inevitable.
Shen Zu, Shen Zu!
And finally, high in Loathly Tower.
My last brother,
Ommadon.
The Red Wizard.
Lord of the devils domain, seducer of darkness,
master of that heartless magic the world calls black.
Bryagh, Bryagh!
My fool brother has just realized the inevitable.
Well, I'll go.
It should prove amusing.
Bryagh I say!
Astride the terrible Bryagh, he is absolute ruler
of that infernal like mass of primordial filth which is his domain.
But why does Antiquity force you to include something so abominable?
As evil is a part of all things,
evil is a part of our world of magic.
For the irony of all existence is that good would be totally impotent without the contrast of evil.
Oh father, take care.
- Gorbash stands ready.
- Then I am on my way.
Ah? Whether does thou command me, Oh Master?
Gorbash, for pity's sake, no formality please.
Heh,... Well I ah,... Like to do things by the book.
To the Temple Of All Antiquity.
- Right. Where?
- I'll guide to as we go.
Away.
Dear brothers, we meet today in the Temple Of All Antiquity.
Come, come get on with it.
Why did you summon us?
As you must have noticed, our magic powers have been growing dim.
I have so noticed.
It is because man is choosing logic over magic.
- But why?
- Because logic is so,... Logical.
So what are you going to do?
Sit around like a bunch of old nanny's and let it happen?
Please, hear me out.
I propose we create the last realm of magic.
- Magnificent!
- Incredible!
The Magic Realm, where all enchanted things might retreat before their age ends.
If we consolidate our powers there will be enough magic left to create such a place.
Sealed off from the rest of the world by the Midst Of Invisibility.
You would defeat science and logic with,... a foolish retirement village?
Not defeat my brother, enhance.
The world though it does not realize it cannot do without magic.
For example, man hears of the dragons invulnerable skin
and lo, he makes armor, battleships, tanks.
A fairy flies and furiously jealous man
himself defies gravity with machines he will call airplanes.
A magician looks into this crystal
and sees and hears halfway across the world.
"Aha", says man, "if only it could be so."
And centuries from now
he conjures up miracles but calls them radio and television.
If man is to surmount the insurmountable there must always be magic to inspire him.
The world needs magic.
Magic cannot die.
It shall be.
I will bring you distant stars, wonders from the sea.
And I will bring you peace and harmony so that every magic thing might live together and share what enchantment remains.
No! Never!
I will not concede defeat by this modern world!
I will not retire to this "Fool's Paradise."
But we have no choice! The inevitability is the strongest magic of all.
I have weapons you would not dare use.
Fear rules men.
By summoning all the dark powers
I will infest the spirit of man so that he uses his science and logic to destroy himself.
What havoc and raze. Turn brother against brother.
Greed and averous shall prevail.
And those who not hear my words shall pay the price.
I'll teach man to use his machines.
I'll show him what distorted science can give birth to.
I'll teach him to fly like a fairy.
And I'll give the ultimate answer to all his science can ask.
And the world will be free for my magic again.
Stop! This must not be!
We want none of your dark magic.
While your powers die, mine will flourish.
Man will never inherent my domain.
For I am making man mine.
He will understand and come to desire my magic.
It is inevitable.
You shall see.
This dark determination
I swear.
By this red crown.
The source of all my dark power.
So be it!
Now and forever!
Farewell.
Can you not feel the world turning in my direction already?
Can his dark magic be stopped?
Only by invading his realm and capturing that cursed red crown from his head.
You may include me.
I will bring the fire of the meteors, the rage of the seven seas.
What was that all about?
Antiquity will not allow us to become involved.
The eternal laws of enchantment expressly forbid the four magic brothers from waring on one another.
Oh, quite right.
Terribly sorry.
- But what can we do?
- We must inspire a quest.
With its sacred mission, to steal the Red Crown Of Ommadon.
We will enlist the aid of allies who share our beliefs.
Mortals, enchanted folk, beast, dragons.
All such creatures in my dominion are peaceful.
Hardly suitable.
I can inspire Neptune himself to join and great whales and serpent of the sea.
Unfortunately, the quest will be waged on land.
No good brothers, it seems I and I alone can inspire such a mission.
Whom will you send?
Well first, my old friend
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe,
The Gallant Knight And True.
- And?
- My dragon, Gorbash.
He's young and impetuous but incredibly strong and brave.
And...? There must be three to begin a magic quest.
The laws so command.
There will be another.
A leader.
Who?
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- How Then?
Tonight, after you both have returned to your realms
I will turn to antiquity for the choice.
Its wisdom shall prevail.
Well, whoever Antiquity choose, Your leader will have his job cut out for him.
I leave him this,
The Shield of Saturn.
Forged from the mystic dust of her rings, it will deflect any dark magic spell.
I have only implements of peace, but perhaps he will find the
Flute of Healing Sleep useful.
It is from the
Temple Of The Muses.
When played, it will lull the most fearsome dragon to sleep.
Thank you, good brothers.
Ommadon will not prevail, and his crown shall be captured.
- So be it!
- May victory be ours.
Hay, a war at last.
Finally I'll will see battle.
Not a war.
A quest.
Well what ever you call it.
I'm ready for it.
Unfortunately so is Ommadon.
Hear me now Antiquity.
Hear me, oh great conglomeration of spirits gone before.
Make you will known.
Who shall lead the quest to capture The Crown Of Ommadon?
Search the future.
He will be the distant descended of Great Peter
The Dragon Master.
Ah, I have heard legends of Great Peter.
Centuries ago he tamed the dragons and taught them to speak.
Seven hundred and seventy seven generations
separate Great Peter from he whom you seek.
But why so many generations away from the original.
He is the first of the descendants who is a man of science.
Why should that be important?
TRUST THE JUDGMENT OF ANTIQUITY!
I do, I do. Implicitly.
Tell me in which century will I find this champion.
Ten hence from this. Our nine thousandths.
That would make it the 20th century by man's calendar.
The closing decades.
A silver acorn?
Drop it into the Limpid Pool of Time
and you will find him.
And now, farewell.
Are you certain this is
The Limpid Pool of Time?
My dear young fellow, I am one of the four magic brothers.
I should know a limpid pool of time when I see one.
Dragons and wizards and dungeons and princesses.
Dragons and wizards and princesses and dungeons and castles.
Mr. Dickenson, is this all you think about?
Never mind what I think, what do you think of this new
Flight Of Dragons game I invented?
It's fun.
What can I say.
Just a couple of thousand dollars we can manufacture this and we'll all be living like kings.
"Just a couple of thousand." he says.
Like it was peanuts.
This is an heirloom. It must be worth something?
Your heirs didn't loom so big.
If I give you fifty I'd be fired.
Flight Of Dragons, aren't you writing a book by the same name?
Was,
I don't have time to work on it now.
Not with holding down two jobs but, if this game sells...
You know something, Mr. Dickenson?
Nothing personal, but you're a real dragons nut.
They fascinate me.
Always have.
I'm sure they really existed at one time.
See, I'm trying to dope out how they breathed fire, how they flew, how they...
I take back the nut part.
Your a dragon fanatic.
Right, I eat, breathe, and sleep em'.
I hope to become a member of England's Dragon Society and I live here in Boston!
You turn, evil wizard.
Why am I always the bad guy?!?
Nine!
Aha! I got you blocked in
The Enchanted Ice Passage, frozen stiff.
Yeah, but an 11 we'll give me dragon fire to melt it...
That's going to be our leader?
That's the seven hundred and seventy seventh son of...
Antiquity must know.
Trust Antiquity.
How's he going to stand up to Ommadon?
Playing with toy dragons.
Look! Look closely at those small chessman he's playing with.
The piece the pawn broker is playing with is Ommadon.
And there's me,... and my brothers.
Dickenson piece is you!
And in the background, Princess Melisande!
Extraordinary!
Somehow, Dickenson knows what we look like.
Somehow...
Good old Antiquity.
I knew I could trust it.
Gorbash, fly to Silvenair and wait for me.
Tell Melisande to summon
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe.
But where are you going?
Intombley... Varioso...
Custon... Wizar... Kala!
Bring me to him. I insist!
Marvanzio... Kala!
What the heck happened? Hey, are you deaf or something?
A splendid game.
Come down and joint it.
What?
Untronto... Kala!
Twelve.
There's no beating that.
Come down I say.
Kala.
- What happened?
- I'll explain during the journey.
- Journey?
- Sit down.
Vidzumad... Kala.!
Keep your wits we're almost there.
That's what you said before!
Since those diced burned out it seems like we've been falling for hours.
Actually it's been more like ten centuries.
- Welcome home, Carolinus!
- Good old Smrgol!
A dragon!
I'm actually seeing a dragon!
A real dragon?
Call me Smrgol!
Son of a gun, a dragon!
I'm talking to a dragon!
I'll get you down.
A dragon, I'm riding a blooming dragon!
What you call me?
Ow!
- Turn your head!
- Pardon me, I'm sorry.
I've just been singed by dragging fire.
What a great way to travel.
Well, if you don't need me any longer,
I hear the call of my comrades.
A mating dance perhaps… Um?
Really, Smrgol. At your age.
You wanted dragons my son, dragons you shall have.
I'll never understand.
All those toy chessman I carved.
Those dragons and wizards.
How did I know what you look like?
Why question? Just trust Antiquity.
Am I dreaming all this?
Am I on that game board or in reality?
Perhaps somewhere in between.
Imagination is the most potent of all magic.
Look! Another of your creations come to life.
- Father! Father!
- The Princess Melisande.
My fairy princess.
Oh, I made her everything I ever desired in a woman.
Well, what I mean to say.
What you mean to say, is just what you said.
- Will I meet her?
- Yes.
Oh, but not dressed like that.
Department store Seersucker all charred by dragon exhaust.
Convento... Circulum… Kala.
I hope the fit is correct.
As I explained during the drop, my magic is quite limited these days.
Your Highness, may I present, ahh...
Sir Peter.
- Sir Peter, this is the Princess Melisande.
- Your highness.
Oh, you must be he whom my guardian has sought to save our world.
Ahh, I… suppose I am.
- Am I?
- Trust in Antiquity.
Did you summon
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe as I requested?
He'll be here by dawn tomorrow.
Carolinus!, Hello!
Wow! Another one.
Hey, look at what I've been saving.
Its gold, Gold, GOLD!
Oh! That pain again. I've asked him not to bellow so.
Simply magnificent sight.
But Sir Peter, it is only
Gorbash our house dragon.
House dragon?
Now you've met the entire family.
Gorbash, this is Sir Peter.
Oh yes, how-d'ye-do.
See a soup tureen.
A-A bowl to you, of solid gold.
Really Gorbash.
If you're hoard grows much larger, there will be no room for furniture in the house.
Blast, that's what I keep telling you.
I need a cave of my own.
Soon enough, when our quest is victorious.
Well ah... Sir Peter old buddy, your army's better be worth their salt.
We need power.
- My army's?
- Sir Peter has brought no army's.
What? No armies!
Aah,... Will you please.
What good is he? What good is he!
What good is he!
Calm down. Now just look at yourself.
Release some gas young fellow, at once.
Huh? Oh...
And turn your head.
Extraordinary!
The fiery breath has something to do with the dragons ability to fly.
- But what?
- I'm certain you’ll figure it out.
Help!
Help me!
- Uncle Smrgol!
- He's lost his fire! Help him Gorbash!
- What happened, old friend?
- My... My comrades...
My Cronies...
The entire... flight they all...
All turned against me.
The other dragons?
Why?
Because I-I wouldn't denounced you and... and join Ommadon.
The other dragons have gone over to Ommadon?
Aye. Aye he's cast a spell on them all.
A flight of dragons to protect his crown.
What a strange use for gold.
Because dragons tend to ignite ordinary bedding, they must find a soft metal to sleep on, and gold proves most comfortable for them.
Ah,... hence the dragons need for a hoard.
Ahem. Perhaps we'd better continue this conversation in my study, less chance of interruption there.
The Last Realm Of Magic,
My own personal dream.
Wow, what a movie show!
Sit down my son, I've got lots to explain.
So that is Peter Dickenson!
That is the pathetic fool Carolinus has enlisted to steal my crown.
Still, Antiquity must have had a reason.
Bryagh, fetch me the fool.
And so you were the one person from all the centuries whom Antiquity has chosen.
They say it is because
I am a man of science?
Well aren't you?
I was at first, honor student, scholarships, awards, grants, research,
but, how it all bored me.
Who could ponder equations when he had the chance to imagine dragons?
So I turned my back on it all
and started on my book
"The Flight of Dragons".
"The Flight of Dragons".
Yes, yes here it is.
"The Flight of Dragons" by Peter Dickenson.
Th...?!?
It's impossible. That's not even half finished.
Of course not. This is my library of unwritten books.
See? Beowulf, The Idols Of The King,
Gulliver's Travels, The Tempest,
Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz...
Incredible.
Nice to know you finish it some day. Aye.
Oop, no fare peaking at the end.
You are unique.
A man with one foot in the realm of magic and the other in the realm of science.
Sir Peter, I present you with
The Shield Of Saturn and The Flute Of Olympus.
Sir, I'm no warrior.
I'm awkward, clumsy.
Not anymore my son, for I believe you have found your time and place.
You are too modest, Sir Peter.
Let us toast the quest.
No, no, my dear. Cider makes evil magic in the stomach.
Oh, poor father...
You know, I had a professor with your condition but it had nothing to do with magic.
It was plain stomach ulcers.
Milk was the only thing that helped.
Milk? Really?
Alas, Gorbash has devoured every cow with in 20 miles.
Oh father, waist a little magic and change the cider.
- This toast is important.
- Ah, I suppose you're right.
Kala... Bovinamo!
To the quest!
Amazing!
Aww.
I tried all kinds of spells and incantations, but...
You see, Sir Peter?
Your science has helped already.
Do you find this enchanting, Sir Peter?
Beyond my wildest dreams.
If all this is just a game,
I wish to play it forever.
I beg you to take this.
A talisman.
Take it and may it protect you.
You are my champion, Sir Peter.
Bring me back The Red Crown.
Ohhh!
- I'll tell you I smell strange dragon.
- Look, terrible!
Bryagh's capturing your scientist for Ommadon.
And our quest is over before it starts!
- Father, Gorbash, do something!
- Wait here! Come on!
I'll overtake the swine!
The devil dragon is to swift.
A removal spell is called for to bring Peter back.
That takes too long.
Let me do it.
I call on all Antiquity to give me magic enough.
How does it begin?
Carvic crom zoominiy lava.
Yes,
Carvictom... zoomili... lavathol...
Ahh! Father he's dropping Sir Peter!
May our rocks crush your skull.
Untumble... varistone... misaclonis... madleumrot... Oh the biases! Kala!
What happened?
Where's Peter?
He's Gone!
He's Gone!
Gorbash, your releasing to much fire!
Breathe in! Breathe in!
Come nephew, you can pull through, keep breathing.
Yeah. Open your eyes.
Ah, h-he'll be coming around soon.
I didn’t have time.
The spell was incomplete.
- I'm certain we'll find Sir Peter.
- Where?
He could be at Loathly Tower, Boston, or on the moon for all I know.
Uhh.
He's awakening.
Right as reign.
By all that's magic, is the dragon not a wonderful creature?
Open your eyes boy. Come on.
Come all the way about.
It's me lad, your uncle.
Don’t you recognize me?
Uncle? What?
- Melisande!
- I am here, brother.
Brother?...
W-We kissed...
Kissed?
Oh!
What is it child?
Does he knows where Peter?...
He... He...
He is Sir Peter!
Well of course I'm Peter.
By The Beards Of Antiquity!
- I went and merged them!
- Merged?
Peter and Gorbash are one.
Peter is in Gorbash!
Well blast it man, undo it.
I can't undo till I find what
I did in the first place.
But... but where is Gorbash?
He's still inside here with me.
I feel him in the back of my mind, sleeping soundly right now.
Well, may he rest well till I figure how to separate you.
This can't be a game.
I-I-I never invented a rule to cover a situation like this.
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe, at your service!
I ridden all night.
Before the quest begins,
I hope theirs time for a good hot cup of tea.
Tea?
Milk.
My Dearest Brothers
Lo Tae Zhao and Solarius;
Today, at noon, began the quest to capture the Red Crown of Ommadon.
If the urgency of our mission is never questioned, yestereve's tragic comedy is proof enough of our waning magic powers.
For a spell went wrong, and Sir Peter of Beacon Street, was merged with my dragon, Gorbash.
Our quest now contains one knight, Sir Orin Neville-Smythe and one dragon with the mind and heart of twentieth century man.
The laws command that three begin.
Melisande being out of the question,
I enlisted the temporary aid of old Smrgol.
Aw, I know Smrgol is aging and none too strong, but I hope Carolinus will gather other allies.
He'll need them.
Meanwhile, the old dragon will be able to teach Peter the way of his species.
A dragon,... that doesn’t know how to be,... a dragon!
Come on out you mealy-mouthed little runts.
Is this necessary?
You want to fly don't ya?
To fly you need gems stones.
To get gem stones, you rob dwarf mines.
Come on out I say!
And bring gems!
- Hurry now, before we devour you!
- You wouldn't really?
Ah, dwarfs no.
They all sinewy and hairy.
Well the meat you get is not worth pickin' out of the teeth.
Now swallow them down.
Not all the way, let them find your craw.
Odd sensation.
Never had diamonds in your craw?
I never had a craw.
They help grind up the white fire rock when you eat it.
That’s limestone.
A puny man word if I ever heard it.
Eat!
You'd wear down your teeth grinding this stuff so you swallow it in chunks.
Wiggle them around with the gemstones till their pulverized.
It's like birds use grit to grind seeds.
Yeah, but don't talk with your mouth full.
What's all this to do with flying?
It makes the fire in your belly that gives you lift.
Hmm? Limestone is high in calcium.
Calcium when mixed with stomach acids would form hydrogen.
Hydrogen is lighter than air, thus giving the lift you talk about.
Something like a blimp.
What?
You got fire inside you when you go up.
That's all you need to know.
No, that's not logical. How could my ribs contain fire?
If I could only visualize.
Aw, for crying out loud.
Visualize.
I know.
Man this is great.
Now, as you explain,
I'll make a diagram.
Of all the.
Aw, well I'm doing it for Carolinus.
You see we got this great like, um, like a honeycomb of bone and muscle inside us.
- Something like this?
- Hey, hey that's it.
Compartments we can expand and contract.
And when we expand the hydrogen a-a, "Dragon Fire" as it were.
Expands and makes us lighter than air, and up we go.
Hey, how do I get down?
Blow it out.
Belch.
Yes, close the valves and expelled gas to come down.
Well, go ahead.
Turn your head ya' dummy!
Wo-wo-wo-whoa!
But I wonder why it comes out as fire?
Because we're dragons and dragons breathed fire.
Yes, but what makes the ignition?
The "Thor Thimble" fool.
Lluk' n' th' ruff' oof' yor' moufe'
Feel it, feel it with your tongue.
Yes, it feels like a thimble.
Ow! Ow!
Electricity!
The electricity ignites the hydrogen hence the fiery breath.
Dragon fire, dragon flight.
It all makes perfect sense.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for my typewriter.
Ah shut up and eat your limestone.
I must say Lancer, this is the lowest quest I've ever undertaken.
Still, I suppose it necessary that
Sir Peter to learn how to fly.
Nice chap what?
Soon it will be nightfall.
Ommadon hours.
Mmm?
I'd best summon them.
Og, hear that? Aww, he's calling us.
Shall we go back on foot or... do you think you can manage a short flight.
I can try.
Expand... feel the lift...
Now propel yourself this way.
Use your wings to steer to navigate, and to keep your balance.
Woo!
Look, I know you don't like comparisons, but this is exactly how a 747 does it.
I love it!
I say old chap, bad show.
- I'm ok, I'm ok,
- Argh, you blew all your fire.
You won't have any lift again until dawn.
Well you certainly don't want chance night flight.
We best make camp.
Right, I'm going to miss my bed of gold.
Care to join me, Sir Peter?
No, I suppose not.
All big dragoned as you are, must be most annoying.
Aww.
I have a longing to eat a cow.
I can't believe it, an entire cow.
Hoofs, tail, bones, ears... the whole thing.
Yes well, to each his own.
You know, I shouldn't really like you so much, with all that business with Melisande and all.
If it weren't for this, this dragon business, the laws of chivalry would force me to challenge you to a joust.
I hope we never come to that, Sir Orin.
I do love her with all my heart.
Her purity, grace, innocents, and title are an inspiration.
- Have you known her long?
- Since she was five.
Oddly enough, you brought us together.
- Me?
- Well, Gorbash did.
You see about a dozen years ago,
I was mucking about
in Ommadon's Red Devil Realm or whatever it's called.
Some... sort of quest, returning from a crusade, perhaps.
I suddenly spied a rather smashing sight.
A nest of dragons eggs.
Well, I was about to do a charcoal sketch,
when who showed up, but Bryagh.
He began to sup of the next generation, as it were.
Hold and get ye hither, or prepare to die!
Aah!
Rather,... rather good blow, if I do say so.
Must have been half an hour before I opened my eyes.
And when I did,...
I'd found he had decimated the entire litter, save one.
Well it seems a shame to die for an egg.
But I'd made the challenge.
Laws of chivalry and all that, you know.
Bit of this. Bit of that.
He had me. I had him.
Couldn't open his mouth you see, the gases built up inside.
And I, took a bit of a chance
And let him devour my metal gauntlet.
In less than a moment it touched "Thor's Thimble."
Bit of a internal explosion I fear.
Almost killed him. Wished it had.
He didn't like it at all.
Took him seven years to recuperate.
Quite a bit for dragon.
Hates me, needless to say.
Anyway, I'd saved the egg.
Cute little fellow, awkward and helpless.
Named him Gorbash in honor of the contest.
For it was rather gory and
I did get a bit bashed about.
Get it? Gory, bashed. Hence Gorbash.
Popped in on my old friend Carolinus.
Found he'd adopted an enchanting daughter.
Gave her the little dragon.
Old Smrgol said he'd be like an uncle, teach him the way of dragons.
I made a vow to fall in love with Melisande,
when she was old enough, of course.
Kept the vow, huh, dash it lot of good it did me.
And now she likes me.
I did write rules to this game you know.
No, I mean, I'm really quite sorry.
Not at all old chap. Feel lucky she's attracted to you.
Blast! It's fading.
- Is all my magic spent?
- Father, rest.
- But I thought I heard just as it faded.
- Heard want?
A chattering sound which could indicate something so terrible.
No, impossible.
Not in the forest. And yet,
I wouldn't put it past Ommadon to...
See! See! Blast you.
Gentle sweet brother...
My magic's not spent just confused.
I want the forest, not...
I am speaking to you through my magic,
which is none too strong.
Let me be quick. Melisande has powers to see over distance.
- True, but...
- Father, let me try.
Very well my dear.
Close your eyes.
Easy now.
You will see Gormli Forest.
Our friends, defenders of the Magic Realm...
Yes, yes. Smrgol is asleep.
Peter and Sir Orin are speaking.
Oh father, I do hear that sound, it's terrifying!
We best follow the old fellows example.
We'll be nearing the devils realm by the morrow.
And will need all the rest we can get.
Do you Hear? Strange. Like some insects.
Not?... Crickets no doubt.
- Seems to make my hold head tingle.
- Yes it… It is rather annoying.
It couldn't be! They only appear at the seashore.
What?
Impossible I tell you!
Why you yelling at me like that!
You stupid slobbering beast!
Don't you know Sand Murks?
Why you idiotic, tin coated, little goody two shoes.
Peter, it's the Brain Fryer!
Blot out the cursed sound!
Sand Murks, try to understand!
Hold Sir Peter, I beg you.
It's the Sand Murks.
Horrid little creatures who attacked by the millions.
Their chirping drives all living things insane.
Your brain will burn till you die!
Ow!
I did it to bring you to your senses.
Now listen, fly, fly away before it's too late!
Can't,... I can't, used up all my left in the crash before.
Look, I see them.
Clear your mind! Think, think anything a poem, a song, don't let them burn your mind!
Aah!

It rained all night…

- The Noise! I can not stand it!
Melisande, come to your senses!
You! You killed my mother and father, you blamed the night demons!
But you!
Melisande!
Aroo.

Aroo.
- What?
- They've, they've retreated.
Thank heaven. Thank heaven.
Oh my child, what have I allowed to happen.
Have they robbed you of all your senses?
With you sleep like this forever?
Oh, my darling, darling child.
Aroo.
Hold cur. Not one step further.
And this is the thanks I get?
Gorbash old friend.
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Matter of fact, maybe you have.
Who's laughing? Huh?… Making such a confounding racquet.
I haven't slept a wink all night.
Missed my gold and…
Aragh, good old boy,
I -I thought you were dead.
- You know him?
- Know him? Of course I know…
It's Aragh, friend of the family.
Like a, a big brother to you.
What's the matter, Gorbash?
Did the Sand Murks steal your memory?
Sand Murks? Were there
Sand Murks? Here?
Nonsense.
They live by the sea.
Eh Smrgol, you could always sleep through anything.
The whole trick with Sand Murks is to get the big one, the queen.
The others are brainless without her.
Aragh, you're supposed to be dead.
Killed, dragged out to sea by a giant squid.
Quite right.
I woke up underwater.
Awaken, brave Aragh.
I am Solarius, lord of this realm,
and I can restore you.
Do I, do I live once more?
No, you are drowned, but
I have a task for you.
Accomplish it, and you will live again.
Yes.
Ommadon has enlisted the Sand
Murks to defeat Carolinus.
You must destroy them.
Give me life and I will.
After the task. For nothing living can withstand their terrible cries.
Destroy them and you will start to breathe once more.
Seemed like a fair bargain.
I did my part, and as soon as Queen Sand Murk was gone
I started to breathe.
So Solarius obviously did his.
Good old Gorbash.
What times we used to have.
Aragh, I've-I've got to explain.
Explain later, we have the
Sun and must press on.
Forward, to the realm of the red death, and the Red Crown of Ommadon!
Aroo.
- You have friends about?
- A female… Trouble.
She's protecting her cubs.
Wait!
If he's not careful, he'll have the whole family on his hands.
I can't say I mind the chance to rest though.
What the blazes?
Blazes? We've got to get loose.
It's Dragon Ruins.
Hold your breath, don't breathe.
Ugly, foul, smell.
Those golden (crimson) flowers.
Can't stay awake.
Not a wolf for miles.
Well, whoever is doing the shooting god bless him.
He certainly can handle a longbow.
I trust he's on our side.
There he is.
Good show old man. I bow to such expertise.
And doff his helmet to a better man that I.
And I doff my cap to you Sir Orin.
By all that’s holy!
I am Danielle of the woodlands, Sir Orin.
You know me?
My father sang of your exploits.
You have always been a hero of mine.
- Too good to be true.
- Hush!
You must forgive the wood elves.
They are petty outlaws, but good at their jobs.
And this is their leader,
Giles Of The Treetops.
For shame!
We saw the dragons.
We thought they were Ommadon raiders.
A thousands pardons Sir Orin.
Had we but known.
Ahh, think nothing of it little fellow.
The way things are nowadays, we all get a bit mucked up.
Get your men down from the trees and awaken the dragons.
Hurry now.
Whatever your quest is,
I should be honored to join.
Well, it's a bit unusual, but, speaking for myself,
I should be honored.
Nay, delighted to have you.
I assure you, my skills will prove most useful.
Daniel has joined them father, and Giles, The Elvin Outlaw.
Night is falling and they are but a day away,
from the Realm of Ommadon.
Looks like an inn.
Hellsway, last outpost of civilization before the realm of red death.
And beyond that wall, all is Ommadon's.
Seems to be a castle guarding the gate.
Ay, Gormli Keep.
The tollhouse on the way to Hades, with a giant ogre as tollkeeper.
The Ogre of Gormli keep,
I've heard tell of him.
A lumbering three-eyed giant as big as a house.
Press on, to Hellsway Inn.
Good bed and some hospitality will be welcome tonight.
Innkeeper.
Innkeeper I say.
At your service Sir Orin.
How are my friends doing, below?
I will look to them.
I do not usually allow dragons in my cellars.
But for you...
Who are those four somber spoilsports?
Merchants from Ommadon's realm.
You allow Ommadon swine!
Shh!
My inn is between two worlds.
I cannot take sides.
Well I don't like um!
I'll see to the dragons downstairs.
On to Ommadon.
- More wine?
- Wine not.
This isn't wine. It's mead.
But not bad.
Peter, how that a' Beacon
Street song go again?
♪ I came from Louisiana with a banjo on my knee. ♪
♪ Oh ho, Susanna, oh don't you cry for me, I've gone to Alabama with a banjo on my knee. ♪
Pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a,...
I am ruined!
Those dragons, they've devoured over 100 ham,
60 cheeses, and at least 30 barrels of my finest mead.
Tut Tut, you will be well paid.
Dragons have gold you know.
- They have it with them?
- You will be paid eventually.
My father told me,
"Never extended credit to a dragon."
Shh.
Too late for such caterwauling's.
Too late.
For the morrow brings…
Your rooms are ready.
Will you finally to bed?
- Ay, good innkeeper.
- For we may not see another night.
I'll, show you the way.
And lo, they sleep. An all to brief surcease, well earned.
And but for the watchful moon keeping her vigil o'er the slumbering countryside
all is still.
Aah!
- What is it child?
- Something looms.
Huge, terrifying. With two mad eyes, where three once were.
The ogre.
Ommadon has sent the Ogre Of Gormli Keep.
- Smrgol, look!
- Um? Ach'. What a terrible mess.
- Did we…?
- Don't-don't admit to anything.
Look! The Innkeeper.
Murdered. It's horrible.
I smell ogre.
Help! Over here!
Giles, are you all alright?
I'm near parboiled to a fare-thee-well.
But I sooner be cooked than crushed by that thing.
- Tell me what happened man?
- I hid in the soup when I first heard him.
He reached in the window and took Danielle and Sir Orin from where they lay.
- Then off he goes.
- Where to?
The dungeon at
Gormli Keep no doubt.
They're to hold them till Ommadon decides what foul deed to perform on um.
Oh no.
A fat lot of good I am at this quest.
Overcome by the Sand Murks and trapped by the elves net.
And then a stupor when the ogre attacks.
Now, now Peter, you've got a job to do.
And you'll do it.
What's that?
You must take the Ogre Of Gormli Keep.
Let me tell you something about how to fight ogres.
- You listening?
- Yes.
Good.
First thing to know this about the bones in an ogre.
They're thick, you see an ogres arms and legs are, are mainly bone. That's why biting is no use.
And their flesh don't burn.
So save your fire.
Aww, If this were my game and I face these odds,
I'd just fold up the board and put it on a shelf.
Ahh, Please continue.
Let's see, hopefully, throw him over a cliff,
If no cliff, go for the throat or stomach.
Never let him get a grip.
I-I'd take him myself but, age has gotten to me.
I know, sir.
- Huh? You mean I should?
- No sir!
Well, don't tell anybody what I just confess.
Ah, there it is.
Gormli keep.
Now you hold back and hide in the brush, we'll need the horse when we free um.
Ay, now, call him out.
Give him the challenge.
- Ahh, what's his name?
- Huh? It don't matter with an ogre.
Hey, you will suffice.
Hey you, come on out and fight!
Go to it lad. Go do it! Now!
Charge him, hit his chest, knock him over the wall.
Strength, give me strength!
No lad! Nooo.
What are you doing?
Aw, bad no.
You let it get a grip on ya!
Aw, blazes!
Hey, Hey You.
Let that schoolboy go.
Ahh, Ommadon coming.
You think he can help you?
- S-S-Smrgol?
- Yes.
Aw, that a,... a back side maneuver, I a...
Will that was, one I'd... uhh, failed to mention.
Easy, easy old friend.
I think...
I think something's,... burst inside me.
I think my heart's gone laddy.
But, but I-I did do him in… huh?
Yes! Yes you certainly did.
What I dreamt, … to have a way, to finish it glorious...
And so they move through Gormli Gate.
Old Smrgol. Oh, I shall miss you friend.
And lo, they enter...
The Realm Of The Red Death.
Easy Lancer, easy boy.
Just a stagnant stream.
We can ford it.
Wait, I know that smell.
Don't go near it!
Daniel, take one of your arrows and shoot it into the stream.
Waste an arrow?
Will need all we have.
I'd do as he says.
By my father. What is that slime?
Dark magic, that's what! Dark magic!
Maybe, but is also highly corrosive acid.
Much stronger than anything
I ever ran into at the lab.
It's got a sulfur base though that's what I smelled.
You do speak in riddles old man.
What's causing the horrible muck?
What is it?
A Worm Of Sligoth.
Never saw one that big.
If Lancer can get me in and out quickly enough,
I believe I can behead the scummy thing.
Wouldn't do any good,
Chop it up into 100 parts and each one would live to spread the slime.
- Do we make a run for it?
- Too chancy.
- Oh, of all the filthy.
- Steady lass.
Peter, fly the others away.
I'll remain and do what I can.
I'll not take flight.
Either I'll have worm for supper tonight or worm sups on wolf.
No, there's a better way.
Peter, are you intact?
Yeah, used up all my fire though.
No lift left.
Don’t know if anyone's though of this but, after that display,
Ommadon sure to know we're here.
These replicas of our visitors are exact, to the smallest detail.
Perhaps they can handle ogres and worms.
But see how they fair with the evil arts of Ommadon.
No, no! Most terrible!
What is it daughter?
What does your mind see?
A grasping hand, dark and fearsome.
To rob them of their will and courage.
To take their hearts and extinguish all hope.
A spell, an evil black magic spell.
Press on you say? What's the use?
- This cause is hopeless.
- Aye.
- We've killed a worm. What's that?
- Wait, what are you talking about?
I'm just a little man, but my foolishness is great.
I belong in the trees, the forest, not here!
My arrows, no matter how true what good are they here?
I don't believe my ears!
Fool! Trick back Carolinus to bring us here.
They are bewitched surly.
Listen, Peter of Beacon Street.
Listen to me, before it gets to you.
What?... Who?... A blue wizard?
Solarius!
Was the Shield of Saturn not given to you?
The shield?... Oh yes, Carolinus said...
It will protect you from Ommadon's spells.
Find the shield son, and drive this obscene force away.
Easy boy, easy!
Away! Away!
What's this?
How dare he?
How dare he?
Yes, Bryagh.
It's your turn now.
You and your legions.
Attack!
Demolish!
Devour!
Burn!
Grind them to dust!
Go forth and death be thy destination!
Doom. Doom.
A Flight of Dragons!
I COMMAND IT!
A FLIGHT...
OF DRAGONS!
Doom. Doom.
Doom. Doom.
- Look!
- Dragons!
Dozens of them. Hopeless.
It may be hopeless, but, I'll take a few of them before they get me.
- Let me take Bryagh.
- If I die, let me die a dragons killer.
No offense Gorbash, but I suddenly hunger for dragon.
Wait, we've got a chance.
Sir Orin, in your saddle pack, the tiny golden flute. Give it to Giles.
Now elf, pipe us a tune.
Quickly!
- And they are down, all the dragons.
- Destroyed?
- Asleep.
- But an enchanted sleep.
When they awaken, Ommadon spell over them will be broken.
They will join us!
The Red Crown of Ommadon may soon be ours.
Nay father, nay.
One still is awake.
Bryagh. Ommadon's power over him is stronger than Lo Tae Zhao's.
He has blood on his mind and can take them all.
Peter will fight him.
No, father. Peter being a dragon, now sleeps too.
Awaken old boy. We've won!
I've never seen such a sleep.
Puny scum of Carolinus!
Prepare to die!
No!
Oh my darling,...
Dead.
I'll crush you both, you filthy crawley!
Aah!
Giles, my darling Daniel, and Aragh too!
Blade, with whom I have lived.
Blade, with whom I now die.
Serve right at justice, one last time.
Seek one last heart of evil.
Still one last live of pain.
Cut well old friend, and then,... farewell.
Praying?
Now die.
I would have... lived a life with thee Lassy.
So now I die.
I am victorious.
Not quite yet.
Well, well, well.
The scientist!
And how did you shed dragon, filthy little man thing?
As Gorbash slept, I suddenly felt myself, Peter Dickenson.
And I thought, "Two things cannot occupy the same place at the same time."
And the moment I comprehended that...
Voilà.
I guess logic is stronger than magic.
Stronger than my magic?
Lo!
I... have gathered... the sum total... of the worlds evil... in one place.
And that place is me.
I am invincible!
No magic stronger!
I am the world and the world is Ommadon.
I can do anything.
Test me.
I can reach up and pluck down the Sun.
You can't do that.
Why, why you insect?
Why?
Seven heads and each one a simpleton.
Don't you know what you reach for isn't in that position anymore?
The Sun is the Sun!
- I can see where it is!
- Where it was pip-squeak!
Any school boy knows that light travels at 186,300 miles per second.
What you see is the Sun's position eight and a half minutes ago.
No magic but mine, can move the Sun.
I command it!
Not magic gas head, mathematics.
And that's the answer to why Antiquity chose me.
You are magic. Mere illusion.
I am science, logic, and the truth.
You don't frighting me.
Nothing so horrible could be real.
- I deny you!
- Deny me and you deny all magic.
Say it then!
I deny all magic!
Deny this...
Kimpacto... solauu... insomaa.
Eran... courant... palay.
Ocaun... eeoan.
Those incantations can't hurt me.
I have some incantations of my own.
How about,
A body in motion tends to stay in motion.
Protons have 1,832 times the mass of electrons.
All light is bent or refracted as it goes from one medium to another, in a direction perpendicular to the interface between the two mediums.
- AAH!
- Hallucinations may result from the selected actions of external conditions.
Upon the variations from their specific type which individual present,
Gravity varies as to the inverse square of the distance.
The velocity of light is equal to the wavelength times the frequency of vibration.
The geometrical properties of the space time continuum are determined by the masses present in space and time.
Come devils, witches, demons, ogres, trolls, sand rats, harpies, ghouls, sorcerers.
Come algebra, anatomy, astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, geometry, mathematics, meteorology, neurology, oceanography, paleontology, physics, psychology, sociology, logistics, and so on. sociology, logistics, and so on.
AAAHH!
AAAHH!
Behold my darling, the magical realm.
And look.
It's Carolinus.
I am home.
We are home.
Well Gorbash, awake at last?
Aragh, I thought you were dead beneath the sea!
Old friend. Oh thank heaven you're still intact.
We've won, Sir Peter we've won!
I don't understand. Why the blazes do you call me by this man name?
- Gorbash?
- Of course Gorbash.
Why so shocked, Sir Orin?
You who practically hatched me.
Sir Peter, is gone.
Gone? Where?
As Carolinus hoped, he used his knowledge of science to deny magic.
But, by denying magic, he is lost to us forever.
- Father!
- Melisande! She's awake.
Father, Sir Peter was here.
- Yes, yes my darling.
- Look!
The Crown of Ommadon.
As foretold, it awaken you.
No, the kiss awakened me.
The kiss?
I was lost in that sleep of death.
Then I felt his lips upon mine.
I opened my eyes, and for an instant I saw his smile.
Then he was gone.
Awakened you with a kiss eh?
Well, perhaps he isn't completely lost to magic.
May, … May I join him father?
Of all questions, I feared that the most.
- May I?
- That must be your decision child.
Go, and you may never return to the Magic Realm.
For even now the great dome of invisibility grows over our world to protect its sanctity for all time.
And no one on the outside may enter its boundaries, save for the length of a dream or flash of an inspiration.
But it will stay through the years the centuries and the ages.
A part of man for all time.
And when ever man needs magic, we will be here.
Eleven!
You dragon fire melts my ice.
Oh, you win.
- Look, I gotta' get back to work.
- Wait a minute.
- I do have some business now.
- I told you that watch of yours...
Not the watch.
This.
Ye gods! Solid gold!
- Where did you find this?
- Oh, I had a hoard.
I don’t blame you for not telling.
You can live off this for years.
Travel, Europe, Asia, cruises.
No, I'll be satisfied with a cottage surround by trees near a stream.
Like one I used to know.
Oh, can I help you Miss?
Where do you kids get these things?
Melisande!

Bye.
Jonathan Brisby was killed today while helping with the Plan.
It is four years since our departure from NIMH
and our world is changing.
We cannot stay here much longer.
Jonathan was a dear friend.
I am lost in knowing how to help his widow.
She knows nothing of us, or the Plan.
Perhaps best that I do nothing at present.
I shall miss him.
Johnason.
Wherever you are.
Your thoughts must comfort her tonight.
She'll be waiting, and you will not return.
Farewell... my friend.
Mr. Ages?
Mr. Ages, is anybody home?
Go away!
Mr. Ages!
What is it?
Mr. Ages, may I please speak to you?
What?
I said, may I please speak... with you.
Oh, thank goodness
I'm so glad you're home.
Confounded machine!
You never know when it's going to up and blow!
Yes.
I don't suppose you would remember me..
Yes, you're Mrs. Brisby.
And I am sorry about your husband's death.
Now if you'll excuse me...
Mr. Ages!
Great Jupiter woman, what do you want?
Mr. Ages, I know you don't like visitors but this is an emergency!
Please!
Madam, that is an emergency.
Oh Mr. Ages, my son Timothy is so sick!
Timmy? The one with the spider bite?
Oh, just give him some pepsissiwa root and...
No!
No, he's sick with a fever!
Well... I suppose I could fix up something...
Oh thank you!
Follow me, but don't touch anything!
Understand?
I do appreciate it...
Just how high is his fever?
He's burning hot to the touch.
Yes.
He's soaking wet with perspiration...
Yes?
And there's a raspy sound when he breathes.
A raspy sound you say? Well..
Does he have a chill?
Yes, he does.
Have you wrapped him in a blanket?
Yes.
Now step inside, but keep your hands to yourself!
I'm right in the middle of... something very important.
I understand.
Oh, do you?
Look at this mess...
Oh, shoo, shoo, go on!
- Your son has pneumonia.
- Pneumonia?
It's not uncommon, but you can die from it.
Oh please dear God, no.
Your son must stay in bed.
Bundle him up.
Yes.
- Not to go outside...
- But how long must...
Three weeks.
He cannot be moved for at least three weeks.
But Moving Day is nearly here!
- You asked my advice, and I gave it to you!
- I'm sorry.
He must stay in bed.
Now, mix this... this powder in a broth and make him drink it.
It'll bring down the fever.
Oh, bless you sir!
And bless yourself, you'll need it.
Now, you must excuse me...
You know the way out.
Oh, of course.
Thank you once again...
Shoo shoo shoo. Go on now. Go on.
Thank you so... much. Goodbye.
Is everything all right here?
What the... Oh! Lady, don't sneak up on me like that!
I didn't mean to frighten you...
Oh, you didn't frighten me, I was just sort of... working out.
You just broke my concentration, that's...
You look more like you're all tangled up.
Er, yeah
I guess that's enough exercise for one day.
Besides, I'm really after this terrific string!
I'm working on a love nest for two.
You know what I mean?
Oh I see... you have a girl.
Well, not really, I mean...
I haven't found Miss Right yet.
But when I do the whole world will hear us singing...
Excuse me, pardon me.
Well, you keep making all that noise and Dragon will hear you.
If he hasn't already.
Wouldn't you sing too? I mean if you felt... heh heh... if you felt the call of the wild, but...
I would... I would not if I knew there was a cat nearby.
But..
But SHE'S out there... somewhere... and when I find her I'll feel it way down in my wishbone!
I... What cat?
Dragon! He belongs to Farmer Fitzgibbons.
Look towards the house. See if you can see him.
Come back down here!
He'll see you for sure up there!
Hey, there's a cat out there!
Quiet! Does he see you?
No.
Yes!
Stand perfectly still.
Everything's fine... he's headed right for us.
Don't panic! Fast or slow?
Medium. Make that fast. Very f...
I have to go now! Excuse me, I really...
Break!
Oh my goodness.
It's a rabbit!
Well of all the silly nincompoops!
You got yourself all worked up over a rabbit!
You should have seen yourself!
Will you keep quiet?
You were scared stiff!
A rabbit! I knew it all along!
Will you hush up?
Admit it! You were scared!
Oh... fiddlesticks. Hold still.
If I had actually been near a cat,
I'd be sneezing my brains out.
See, I'm allergic to ca...
I'm allergic to caaaaa...
I'm allergic to caaaaa...
I'm allerg... AHHH-CHOOOO!
Excuse me, pardon me.
The string, quick! Grab the string!
Hey, Miss Mouse, don't worry, I'm ok.
See? I'm alright.
That's not the reason I'm crying.
I lost Timmy's medicine.
Aw, don't cry. I hate to see a woman cry...
Hey! Was I great, or was I great? Did you see that cat out there?
All dripping, and... and wet... with water...
I'll... go back to Mr. Ages tommorow, and...
You weren't so bad yourself.
Hey, we make a pretty good team!
Oh, here, you dropped this back there.
Nobody messes with ol' Jeremy, boy.
Nobody!
That's it! Timmy's medicine!
Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!
Huh? It i... what? It is? I mean, it is.
Well, I saw it lying there, and I said uh...
My name is Jeremy.
I'm Mrs. Brisby.
Thanks again!
I have to go home now.
Uh, where's home?
In the garden patch, by the stone.
Do you like me?
Of course I like you!
Bye now.
No! I mean... I mean, um... I mean you don't think I'm clumsy or anything?
Oh... sorry. Excuse me, pardon me.
Oh. Well, if you're going to feather a nest you've got a lot to learn about how to treat a lady!
Right. When you're right, you're right.
And you're right.
None of the girls I meet want to get serious!
I doubt they'd survive.
Huh? Maybe it's my approach.
Say! You were a girl once!
You could teach me how to... you know, how to...
Behave yourself?
I'm not that bad!
I just need a few pointers to polish my style.
Jeremy, I have got to go home!
Well let me... Let me fly you home!
We can talk on the way!
Oh, no thank you. I'm afraid of heights.
OK, then we'll walk.
Bye now.
I think I got real potential
I mean, girls go for the athletic type, don't they?
Jeremy, you're stepping on my tail.
Excuse me, pardon me...
Maybe I should go look for Mom.
I don't think so, Martin.
Brisby! Briiiiiisby!
Oh! Auntie Shrew!
Oh Auntie!
Oh no...
She'll wake up Timothy!
She's not here.
Why is she always coming around here, poking her nose in where she's not wanted?
Martin!
Thank you child. I must speak with your mother.
Your Auntie is exhausted!
Why me?
That I alone should be responsible for the welfare of the entire field is monstrous!
Brisby!
Mother isn't here.
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!
Cynthia dearest, don't pull me.
She's not here?
She left you children alone then?
I'm old enough.
Rats in the field up to heaven knows what sort of mischief...
Cynthia dear, don't fidgit!
You're so like your mother!
I ain't scared of nuthin!
She went to see Mr. Ages.
To Ages? That old flim-flam!
Whatever for?
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!
Patience, my pet.
Why to Ages?
- Timmy's sick!
- Timothy is very ill.
Timmy ill? How dreadful!
I'm not afraid of the dark!
I'm not afraid of the farmer!
I can't hear!
I'm not even scared of Dragon.
I'm not even afraid of... of... of the Great Owl!
- Will you hush up?
- Aw, you hush up!
Martin!
Precocious monster!
Bossing bullfrog!
Spoiled brat!
Loudmouth!
That will be quite enough, thank you!
Cast not pearls before swine,
I always say... and that includes impudent piglets!
Good day!
Oh! You impertinent little...
Martin! Auntie Shrew, what's going on!?
Indeed!
Please... come back inside...
Not for a king's ransom!
I have just one thing to say.
That child is a brat!
Yes, I will speak to him.
I came here to inform you... that the frost is off the ground... and Moving Day is at hand.
Prepare to move your very very odd family.
Good day.
You never know what might be lurking about out here what with rats and...
Well, children. Now you've done it.
It was Martin.
The Shrew means well.
She only wants to help.
Gosh, I'm sorry, Mom.
Is Timmy gonna die?
No, sweetheart. He's just very sick.
What's the matter with him, Mother?
Mr. Ages called it... pneumonia.
Pneumonia?
When will he get better?
Soon... I hope.
Off to bed with you now.
Dear, a man came by today, from NIMH.
- NIMH?
- Yes, you know!
The National Institute of Mental Health.
He was asking if we had noticed... anything strange... about the rats on the farm.
Well, I said "No, nothing unusual".
Beth, I have to get up early.
Oh, it gave me goosebumps to hear him carry on that way!
Like the rats might have some horrible disease!
Night, Beth...
I told him you'd call him back.
What did I tell you? Moving!
- It can't be!
- It certainly can!
I don't suppose you've packed!
What about Timmy?
The chill in the air could kill him!
Well child, that tractor surely will.
For the last time, get your children out of here before it's too late!
Run! The plow is here, run!
It's Moving Day!
Run!
The plow is here!
Run!
Run! Get out!
Brisby!
Go get... Timothy!
Please! Take the children out of here!
Mommy, we can't leave Timmy!
Go with Auntie Shrew.
I've got to try to stop that thing!
Wait! You're out of your mind!
Brisby, come back!
Brisby! Hang on!
Hang on!
Brisby!
Come on! Come on!
Well of all the rotten luck... fuel line's cut.
He'll come back tomorrow...
I wish Jonathan were here.
Well, he's not.
Stop it!
What am I going to do?
We'll think of something.
Come on, let's get out of here.
The Great Owl would know what to do about this.
You must go see him.
Oh I... I couldn't do that.
Owls eat mice!
Well my child, show a little courage!
We're fighting for Timmy's life!
Jonathan, your wife, I fear
Is in desperate trouble.
A visit to the Great Owl may indeed be profitable.
Go to the Owl then, Mrs. Brisby.
Go there!
Nice evening huh?
I told you you'd love flying.
I don't know how
I let you talk me into this!
Aw, don't thank me, Mrs. Briz.
When we get to the Great Owl he'll know just what to do about everything!
Owls eat mice!
Ummmm... only after dark...
That must be the Owl's tree over there.
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody home?
Well, the place looks deserted.
I guess we'd better get outta here.
Step inside my house...
Come inside, or go away.
Timothy... remember Timothy.
Why have you come?
Please forgive me for disturbing you... but my son's life is in great danger.
The plow has come early this year and...
Move your family.
Yes... I would move, but Timothy has pneumonia.
He can't even get out of bed.
You must move it to a place where it will be safe from the plow.
Please... there must be another way.
There is no other way.
I must bid you good evening, Mrs...?
Mrs. Brisby.
Brisby? Mrs. Jonathan Brisby?
Why yes! He was my husband!
But... how do you know about him?
That is not important.
I will say this... his name is not unknown in these woods.
Please sir...
I'll do anything to save Timmy.
Anything.
There is a way.
Go to the rats.
But I don't know any rats!
In the rosebush.
Oh yes... near the farmhouse.
Go there.
Ask for Nicodemus.
Nicodemus?
But how can they help?
They must move your house to the lee of the stone.
No rat could move my house! It's...
They have ways!
I don't understand... but I will do as you say.
It is night. I must go.
Remember... the lee of the stone.
What... what did he say?
He said to go to the rats.
Rats. What rats?
The lee of the stone...
Mrs. Briz! Briz!
Oh, excuse me, pardon me.
Jeremy? What on earth?
I'm in disguise!
Jeremy, please, not now!
I'm trying to find the entrance, and these thorns are very dense.
Here, let me help you...
Will you be quiet?
They'll hear you!
I've got to find this Nicodemus before the farmer gets that tractor fixed!
I'll keep a lookout!
Will you...! You're going to get us both killed!
I don't see anybody coming.
If you really wanted to help me, you'd go away.
Why that's very brave of you, Mrs. Briz but I can't... I can't leave you here alone.
Why, if anything were to happen, think... think of the children!
That's it!
Huh? That's what?
Jeremy someone strong should be protecting my children.
In case that tractor starts up again.
Oh, in case the tra...
Hey! How 'bout me?
Oh, would you?
Yeah, sure! That'd be terrific practice!
Girls can't resist a guy who's good with kids, you know, domestic type.
Play games, help out, domestic!
Yes. Yes, domestic.
Now whatever you do don't tell them where I am.
My lips are sealed, Mrs. Briz.
Bye.
Good luck with the rats!
Where do you live?
By that big stone in the garden.
Just stay out of trouble?
Not to worry, Mrs. Briz.
I love kids and kids love me.
Kids love me and I love kids.
Dragon! You lazy kitty!
Go catch some of those rats out in the barn!
I've never seen a cat sleep so much.
Er... hello.
I'm... I'm Mrs. Brisby.
Umm... I was told to see Nicodemus.
Are you Nicodemus?
Please, I need help!
Who goes there?
Me!
Mrs... Brisby?
What are you doing here?
Oh! Oh thank goodness it's you!
How in thunder did you get in here?
The plow has come early to the field... you had better march straight back out the way you came!
I can't bring Timothy out.
The chill in the air will kill him!
That's another matter. That doesn't explain what you're doing here.
And that big rat chased me away.
But I must see Nicodemus!
The Owl told me to see Nicodemus!
Well, yes, perhaps you should...
The owl said?
Here now, what owl?
What are you talking about?
I went to see the Great Owl.
The Owl? You say you saw... the Owl?
Yes, and he said I should ask for Nicodemus.
Er, yes, I know Nicodemus.
He lives with the rats.
More specifically, he is the leader of the rats.
You know him?
No one has ever seen the Owl... and lived to tell about it!
Please... could you take me to see Nicodemus?
Well... ye-e-ess, yes.
But for your sake, I hope you're telling the truth!
Come on.
What about the large rat at the entrance?
I can't go back there. I can't.
Oh, that's just Brutus. Follow me.
Well? Come on!
Jonathan, your wife has come at last.
Perhaps now I can repay you for your kindness to me.
Yet Mrs. Brisby, who served the rats of NIMH far more than we her.
Jenner I fear may do her harm...
He is consumed by a lust for power.
Thus far, the amulet has remained safely hidden.
But if he finds it...
heaven help us.
Forgive me, I just noticed you're limping.
That's none of your affair.
Now, to what you are about to see and hear you must swear absolute secrecy.
- Yes, I unders...
- Swear it!
I promise.
If any of this ever got out we'd have humankind bulldozing their way down here to blow the place apart.
Is it always so dark?
We're down three feet.
It's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen!
Reveal thy name!
Justin, you featherhead!
Get your hands off me!
Ok, ok, just a joke!
I didn't mean any harm.
The meeting's already in progress.
What's this all about?
Who, may I ask?
Yes, yes, she can be trusted.
This is no stranger.
My dear, may I present Justin, the Captain of the Guard.
Justin, Mrs. Brisby.
Not... Mrs. Jonathan Brisby!
Yes, the same.
It is an honor and a privilege, milady.
If we could dispense with the formalities...?
How beautiful...
Ma'am?
Oh! Er... the lights!
They're quite lovely.
Yes, they are.
We've had electricity for four years now.
Five.
Jonathan often spoke of electricity.
But you see, our shame is that we're stealing it from Farmer Fitzgibbons.
Stealing?
All of that is going to change.
He means we're working on a Plan.
I mean, that we have a Plan.
And this stealing will stop.
Now...
Oh yes. Why did you send for me?
It's Jenner. He's at it again.
Hmmm. There blows an ill wind.
He's before the Council now.
This time he's attacking
Nicodemus openly.
And the Plan, no doubt.
Nothing will come of it. It'll pass.
Beware, boy, he's dangerous.
Jenner will be the undoing of the Rats of NIMH.
I'm sorry to come here at such a bad time.
I suppose...
No, sweet lady, you are welcome here.
We tend to take ourselves a bit too seriously.
The Plan is nothing but folly!
A doddering old fool's fantasy!
Nicodemus would have us destroy this colony only to lead us to starvation in some wilderness!
Ahem. Good ol' Jenner.
Wait. Listen.
Moving to Thorn Valley is a good plan!
Fie! We have everything we need right here!
You mean we steal everything we need.
Well come on, you suspicious old goat!
If we stay here, humans are bound to discover us.
They'd destroy us on the spot!
I agree!
He's right. We'll be killed.
Not if we got them first!
He means war!
We'd be outnumbered.
There are too many of them!
Hear me!
The Thorn Valley Plan is the aspiration of idiots and dreamers!
We...
We were just talking about you.
That's refreshing, Jenner.
Usually you're screaming about us.
Who is that?
You know the rules there are no visitors allowed here.
May I present Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.
Jonathan Brisby is dead!
She's not one of us.
What's the meaning of this?
Send her away.
Let's get back to business!
Wait, wait!
She has been to see the Great Owl!
He has told her that we could move the Brisby home to safety.
Her home was Jonathan's home.
We have urgent problems of our own.
Let the lower creatures fend for themselves!
Order, order!
Wait, my friend. I smell an opportunity.
What?
Manoeuvers of this nature are dangerous.
- Accidents could happen...
- Accidents?
Jenner?
- I'll explain later.
Mrs. Brisby! A thousand pardons, my dear!
Forgive the ill temper of my colleague.
It would be an honor to assist
Jonathan's widow in any way.
We are but your humble servants.
Th... thank-you.
I second the motion.
Hear hear!
Motion has been moved and seconded.
Those in favor make a show of hands.
He's up to something...
Take Mrs. Brisby to the library.
We'll approach Nicodemus when the meeting's over.
Motion carried.
Ok now, wait a minute this isn't what you think.
You don't understand what I'm doing here!
Think you can come snooping about looting and pilfering, just when everyone's away?
Well uh... Let me explain about...
Oh! What a lovely hat you're wearing!
Don't you sweettalk me!
I know you're in league with those awful rats!
Rats? Ummm... what rats?
Hoodlums, the lot of you!
Ummmm... why did you say rats?
You think the world owes you a living, right?
Right.
Wrong!
Wrong! Ohhhh..
Look, nice lady, you're making a mistake!
The sooner you delinquents learn that you must earn your own way...
Wait! Wait, can't we uh...
Can't we talk this over?
The sooner, the better.
You can't leave me like this!
There's a ca... ca...
There's a ca... He's a very big... and he might... and he might... mlfffp!
Good! Good riddance!
Teresa! Martin!
That's the least you deserve.
Auntie?
There you are!
Keep an eye on this hooligan.
Make sure he doesn't get away until I can fetch help.
And as for you, you black buzzard.
I wouldn't try anything!
I shall return!
Well, I guess we'd better untie him.
But Martin...
Hey, Mom helped a crow in the field the day before yesterday...
He's trying to talk!
He looks like a loony.
He even took her to see the... the Great Owl!
So?
This could be the same crow!
That's me all... Whew! I am the crow.
Untie me quick, I can't stand it!
What are you doing here?
Oh, it's a good question, but don't ask.
The legs... the legs... THE LEGS!
Aw, the poor turkey fell down.
I'm not a turkey! Your mother...
Where's our mother!
You big buzzard, where's our mother?
- What have you done with her?
- You'd better tell me or I'll tie you back up again!
The... the rosebush! To... to see the rats!
Did you take our mother to the rats?
Well I'm going to go look for her.
No, no, listen, hold it, waitaminute.
The rats, they're friendly!
Good! Tonight... Stay!
They're coming here to move your house where it's safe!
Understand?
Sta-a-ay...
The Owl said they're good and smart.
Get it?
You're right. He's a loony.
Oh no... no, don't...
You must...
No, don't do this!...
Now don't tire him out.
No.
Be brief.
Yes.
Say what you want... and leave.
I won't be a bother.
Justin bothers him enough with all his silly nonsense.
Here we are.
Thank you, Mr. Ages.
I don't know what Nicodemus sees in that boy...
I'll come back for you.
- Brief!
- Brief.
Come closer, my child.
Don't be frightened.
Sir... the Great Owl sent me to you.
Oh, did he?
He is a dear comrade...
Closer.
Ahhh, Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.
What an honor this is.
How... how is it that everyone knows Jonathan?
He was a great friend to the Rats of NIMH.
He himself came from NIMH.
Your majesty, my family is...
I know of your needs.
There is a book there. Read the words.
I can read, a little.
Jonathan taught me.
The children are better... than I am...
Read.
Jonathan... Brisby... made... possible... the rats escape... from the t... terrible cruelty of NIMH.
Jonathan?
He was ki..
Killed today... while drugging the farmer's cat, Dragon.
Oh, I... I never knew... just what happened.
Why did he never tell me about any of you?
Why?
To answer that, I must tell you about NIMH and our Plan.
Go!
Look there!
In the beginning, we were ordinary street rats.
Stealing our daily bread and living off the efforts of man's work.
We were captured, put in cages
and sent to a place called NIMH.
There were many animals there... in cages.
They were put through the most unspeakable tortures
to satisfy some scientific curiosity.
Often at night I would hear them crying out in anguish.
Twenty rats and eleven mice were given injections.
Our world began changing...
Then
one night.
I looked upon the words under the cage door...
and understood them.
We had become intelligent.
We could read.
The miracle was kept secret from the scientists.
And in the quiet of the night
we escaped through the ventilation system.
The mice were blown away
sucked down dark air-shafts to their deaths.
All except two...
Jonathan and Mr. Ages.
We were trapped by a locked door on the roof.
It was Jonathan who made possible the unlocking of the door.
I have a gift. Come.
Jonathan meant it for you.
It's so beautiful!
It sleeps.
Sleeps?
Yes.
When worn by one with a courageous heart the Stone glows red.
It becomes a blinding radiance.
Courage of the heart is very rare.
The Stone has a power when it's there.
Look! An inscription.
You can... unlock any door... if you only have the key.
Oh, thank you.
I will treasure it always.
Jonathan couldn't tell you about NIMH because the injections slowed the aging process.
You see, you would have grown old while he remained young.
Nicodemus.
The boats are ready and waiting.
We can leave any time.
Good.
My child, shall we journey to your home?
Sir?
Tonight we must move your house to the protected side of the stone.
The lee of the stone!
Yes.
I don't get it, Jenner.
With Nicodemus out of the way what's to stop us from taking over?
Jenner, you can't kill Nicodemus!
No taste for blood, eh?
They've taken the animal out of you.
What if we're discovered?
Ach, listen.
The Brisby house is a large cement block.
In the moving, what if it should fall?
- An accident?
- Of course!
Cut the lines, and the weight of it will crush his bones!
It's risky..
Once rid of Nicodemus, the Plan will die.
We can stay here as long as we like!
What... what about Justin?
Leave him to me...
Sometimes, when we have a large project that takes us into the open.
Mr. Ages makes up a sleeping powder to give to Dragon.
How do you get him to take it?
Someone must go into the farmhouse kitchen and put it in his dish.
The only way into the kitchen is through a tiny hole in the floor.
Ages tried it yesterday.
That's how he broke...
Broke his leg.
Right.
That was close.
- What's up there?
- The mill. It's falling apart.
Hope it stays up there at least until we've done with the Plan.
Plan... what is the Plan?
To live without stealing, of course.
It's wrong to take electricity from the farmer.
My child, we can no longer live as rats.
We know too much.
We're almost there.
Um... your Majesty
I should go prepare the children, for tonight.
We shall wait here until dark...
Um... About Dragon, maybe...
Oh nothing. Goodbye!
I volunteer! For Dragon.
Oh no, Mrs. Brisby!
Nicodemus, this is no job for her!
Please.
As you wish.
All right.
I'll meet you at the west side of the farmhouse at dusk.
Thank you.
Oh I must be crazy.
Goodbye!
I must be crazy...
Excuse me... pardon me.
Jeremy?
Shhh! I'm being followed.
Followed?
Shhh-hhh! There's a crazy lady with a hat!
She's got big teeth!
She tied me up! And then I... oh!
Ooooo! A sparkly!
What?
You're wearing a sparkly!
Can I hold? Oh, please, can I?
Jeremy, listen...
I need lots and lots of string.
Stuh... ring...
To move the block!
Move... the block...
Hey! I got string! I've been saving 'em!
You do?
Oh sure, red ones, blue ones
- green, yellow.
- Pay attention!
Go get all the string you can.
Ok.
But that'll take all day!
Good! Get going!
I just thought I'd mention in passing...
I've always wanted a sparkly of my very own.
- Will you get going?
- Sure!
Uh... Excuse me. Pardon me.
Bye!
It won't be long now.
She's washing the dishes.
Here's the powder.
- Nervous?
- Very.
Don't be.
You'll be ok.
I hope I haven't upset your plans.
Nonsense!
What makes you say that?
I thought I might have caused an argument.
Oh you mean Jenner.
No problem.
Justin?
I sincerly hope you make it to Thorn Valley.
We will.
Shh! Listen.
Mrs. Fitzgibbons is filling Dragon's bowl.
Get ready.
Oh my...
Better leave that cape.
Could get caught on something.
Here's the powder.
I don't think I can do this!
Yes you can!
Now take a deep breath.
Concentrate on the bowl.
Don't look at the door!
Steady...
Ok Dragon, I'm coming.
Steady...
There we go.
Now! Now!
Coming, coming!
Get back!
Mom! Don't let the cat in yet
I've caught a mouse!
A mouse?
Can I keep it? Can I?
No, Billy. Put it outside.
Damn!
Aw Mom, please?
I can keep it in Porgy's old cage.
Oh... all right.
Come on, Dragon.
I'll have to come back for you later.
Rats, rats?
They'll be here any minute... to move our house over there by the stone!
Wrong!
Actually move it!
Not while I'm keeping watch!
Auntie Shrew? I'm not afraid.
Afraid, child?
I have no fear of those great hulking beasts.
And should one of those hairy barbarians come through that door...
Oh! The rats!
I'm coming, I'm coming, hold your horses.
Hello?
Who?
NIMH.
Oh! Oh yeah, NIMH!
Yes, yes, I know, you called about the rats...
Well, I don't know nothing about any special behavior but the traps sure don't work...
In the morning?
Suits me fine...
Oh no, no, you can bulldoze that rosebush right outta there
I want those rats exterminated!
Uh, well, there's no... charge...?
Good. Ok, well, I'll see you tomorrow then...
Uh-huh... bye-bye.
NIMH... They're coming here?
I must warn Justin!
Teresa!
Martin!
Auntie's afraid!
Pull on the end-haul.
Careful. Careful!
Easy does it...
Nicodemus is cooperating beautifully...
Jenner... he's standing in just the right spot!
Jenner, I... I can't do it!
When that block reaches midway, you cut the line.
I...
Don't get any ideas, my friend.
You're in this up to your neck!
Come on mates!
Put your backs into it!
Ready with the knife...
Ready...
Cut now!
- I... I...
- Now! Cut it!
Don't!
Ok, help.
We've got to hurry!
That's it.
Come on, come on!
We're coming!
Ok, I see him!
Nicodemus... oh no!
No!
Friends... we cannot move the Brisby home.
But we... we just can't leave it here in the mud.
The equipment is a shambles.
Justin!
One day we shall journey to
Thorn Valley just as Nicodemus wanted... but not now.
Justin!
Mrs... Brisby?
Come. Let us return to the rosebush.
Where we belong.
Oh, Mr. Ages!
What happened?
The children!
They... they're fine.
Nicodemus is... dead.
Oh... oh, no.
You're in great danger.
NIMH is coming!
Come come, let's return to the rosebush...
NIMH is coming!
- NIMH?
- In the morning!
- NIMH!
- Yes.
You will all die unless you leave the farm tonight.
Lies!
Please! You must believe me!
What if it's true?
- We'll all be killed!
- Don't panic!
Don't listen! She's hysterical!
Get out now...
You get out! I've had enough!
Jenner!
Justin! Justin!
Jenner, stop this!
The Stone...
Jenner...
Get out of my way!
I want that Stone!
Jenner!
Justin, Justin!
My sword!
It was you...
You did it!
You killed Nicodemus.
That was no accident!
Yes. I killed him!
He wanted to destroy everything!
I've learned this much.
Take what you can, when you can!
Then you've learned nothing!
Friends... tonight we journey to Thorn Valley.
We will leave no tracks.
No evidence that the Rats of NIMH ever existed...
Come.
Hello, is anybody up there?
- Martin?
- Momma!
Mother, are we almost moved?
Soon now...
It's sinking... it's sinking...
Justin, the block! It's sinking!
What?
Come on!
Oh no, it's sinking!
There must be a... a cave in below!
Here, tie these lines together.
I'll get a line around the stone.
Now!
Brutus, quick, get some rope.
Tie off those blocklines.
Hurry it up, come on!
Move it!
Mother! Mother!
What's all that black stuff?
Come on, Teresa, get up on the table!
Cynthia...!
What about Timmy?
Get us out of here!
Mother!
Another line! Get some rope!
Justin!
Justin!
Hang on! Don't let go!
Grab onto my foot!
I can't breathe!
Oh no! Come on!
- It's sinking farther!
- We're losing it!
Courage of the heart is very rare... the Stone has a power when it's there.
The stone...
Momma, I'm tired of bed.
I want to get up!
Well, you're not getting up.
Miss Briz! Oh Briz!
Where are ya?
Over here!
Here it is!
I brought the whole mess!
There's plenty more where this came from too.
I got connections!
Hey! Your house is moved!
Oh no! What am I gonna do with all this string?
You'll think of something.
Ah, what's the use?
What's a guy like me going to do with a love nest anyway?
- Excuse me, pardon me.
- Excuse me, pardon me.
Look Mommy! Another turkey!
Stay right there.
Miss Briz! Miss Briz!
Lemme have the sparkly!
I gotta have the sparkly!
Miss B, I gotta have it!
Girls can't resist a sparkly, oh please! Pleease!
I gave it to Justin.
Justin? Who the heck is Justin?
The leader of the rats.
The leader of the rats!? How could you do this to me?
What'll I say? Mrs. B, what'll I do?
Well... just be, ummm... Be athletic!
Ah! That's right! Athletic!
I'll just be a little...
Mother, did the rats really go to Thorn Valley?
Yes, they did.
- Will we ever see them?
- Perhaps.
- Today?
- No... when you're older.
Brisby!
Oh! Auntie Shrew!
Oh Auntie!
Oh no!
THE FANTASTIC PLANET
She stopped moving.
Now we can't play with her any more.
Careful! It's Mr. Sihn.
Look, father.
A female Om and her baby.
Is she dead?
I'm afraid so, Tiwa.
Why does the baby make noise?
It's either frightened or hungry.
We can't leave him.
May I keep him?
Let me, father.
I'll take care of him.
All right, Tiwa, we can't let the animal die.
He was the Great Master of the Traag people.
He saved my life and took me into his home.
Mother!
Mother!
See how cute the little Om is!
His mother's dead.
I want to keep him.
He is very pretty, Tiwa.
You disturbed your mother's Meditation!
Make that animal behave or I'll take it away!
Father, he got away.
He needs a collar.
Learn to use the Watch.
Now put the animal down.
It's fun. Let me try.
No so fast.
The animal is delicate.
You might hurt it.
Did you name it?
Tiwa, like me.
That's not an Om's name.
Name it Frisky or Trusty.
Watch him wiggle, the little devil!
I'll name him Terr.
I was forgotten!
A baby Om is nothing compared to Meditation!
A weird virtual.
Traags devoted most of their time to it.
It seemed to be chief concern.
Oddly enough, the housing unit factory on our Uva at Goham... has not met production levels.
The machines show unusual wear...
This wear causes the delay.
Master Taj, can you explain?
We don't know yet.
Meanwhile we’ll use machines from our reserve... to meet the schedule.
I don't understand.
The machines worked perfectly until now.
Have you had similar problems on other Uvas?
Only machines from our space flight... to planet Antax 4 have trouble completing their program.
Master Sihn, our scientists... explain this loss as a break in the sensory compensation system.
Scientists also notice that animals brought from planet Terra... have sovibon and rather high intelligence.
I am not sure that is true.
Obviously, the animal adapts rather well.
But is that intelligence?
The little pet you stroke... between Meditations may well... surprise you some day.
Films made in Terra show many traces of organized life.
This ability to adapt, Master Kon may indicate advanced evolution.
Oms have a much shorter life span that we.
But we must not forget that they multiply much more rapidly.
If the animal is intelligent,
Master Sihn... we have not yet noticed.
What we do notice is the considerable damage... caused by Oms on the Uvas of Jext and Telez.
The numbers of tame Oms is easy to control.
But wild Oms probably exist... in much larger numbers than most of us realize.
We de-om the enclaves... of wild Oms every 3 cycles.
But I wonder if... that is often enough.
Few weapons have a long-term effect.
Drastic measures must be taken.
New ways to fight them are being researched.
I doubt if they will suffice.
Go play somewhere else.
I'm very sorry.
Imagination was so rich today too...
That Om is a pest!
Please, our children all love those animals.
I grew up fast in that slow world.
A Traag week was equal to one of my years.
I was only a live plaything.
I was sometimes rebellious.
Tiwa loved me.
Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat!
Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat!
Tiwa got her learning from a headphone.
Its lessons cut directly into the brain... engraved on the memory forever.
"Our Planet Ygam has one satellite...
"the Fantastic Planet.
It is uninhabited
"and used for Meditation.
"Ygam is divided into several Uvas.
"Uvas Strop and Yot are natural and symmetrical.
"Urtana, the largest Uva, is covered
"with blue assonic blocks.
"Its temperature range...
"is from 8 to 243 laics...
"making ripocal exploitation impossible...
"Our Uva, Goham, has a fepular inland sea...
"stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laics.
"Fixations bloc offset pontic rebation.
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure.
"All Uvas under go a cycle of 3 seasons of unequal length.
"The seasons of garus crystalization..."
An accident enabled me to acquire the Traags knowledge.
"When the soil peels, intense vegetation..."
"replaces all nosks with similar nosks."
I liked the lessons.
I tried to get the most out of them.
"The cliffs on the fepular sea are eroded...
"by rains that often last long."
Tiwa, bring your animal!
Jurgal has his and we'll have some fun.
I don't want him hurt.
Jurgal's animal is insane!
Once, he almost tore off his ears!
He won't damage your Om.
Come and play!
Come and see!
Let Terr fight, it will be more fun.
Terr will win, he's a real demon!
Now fight!
He sings well.
Terr can sing too.
Sing, Terr. Go on!
- He'll strangle him!
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
What a mean animal!
"It is simple to see a tark's fladed muscles...
"because the animal's easily skinned..."
Do you hear the Om?
That's Tiwa's lesson!
She loves Terr so much that he is with her always.
Can he understand what he says?
I don't think so.
Anyway, I'll forbid her to keep Terr during infos.
She must study seriously.
"The liscinian muscle of a trak's leg...
"is a fleshy, fuliform vilok...
"The molog is an enviparous animal...
"It has more than half a billion lucons.
"The entire surface of their walls...
"is made up of little cells...
"separated by leaves of thin organure."
"Some scientists...
"today believe it is not organure but only gambous amalga...
" an artificial structure... "
Have you got Terr again during you info?
I told you to stop!
Into the Omhouse!
But father, he doesn't bother me...
And he's so happy.
The infos are for you!
Get back to work!
It was time for the Traag children to have their first Meditation...
The initiation ceremony was a major step... on their road to knowledge.
After a while
I lost my intimacy with Tiwa.
As she grew up, she gave up her playthings.
Deprived of lessons,
I decided to run away.
Mother, I can't find Terr.
And my headphones are gone.
Use your bracelet!
If he's far away, it'll hurt him.
Put your bracelet on maximum, please.
No, mother...
You're pretty stupid.
Like all tame Oms!
You have a collar too.
It’s a fake, to fool the Traags.
What's that?
The Traags invented it.
What?
The Traags made it.
Listen!
"Valio, cycle, info 4...
"You will observe that Aklon research...
"in solid pernetrope...
"works the same as in plane pernetrope.
"Notice that we look for festation groups..."
Don't worry, it's not dangerous.
Where are you taking it?
- I don't know.
- Come with me!
My new friend took me to her people who lived hidden in the Big Tree. deep in an abandoned park.
As a silly tame Om, my first meeting with wild Oms was a failure.
Don't touch that case, it's a trap!
Since I brought the headphones of knowledge... the wizard opposed me at once!
We've brought 5 cases, Chief.
What? Is that all?
One of them was a trap and Speed is dead.
He knew it was a trap.
He's a tame Om.
He ran away with a Traag device.
It taught him to read Traag writing.
He knows what's in the cases?
In that one?
Color powder.
"Urtana is covered with blue assonic blocks.
"Its temperature range is from 8 to 243 laiks...
"making ripocal exploitation impossible.
"Our Uva, Goham, has a fepular inland sea
"stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laiks.
"Fixations blocks...
"offset ontic rebation.
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure..."
Why interrupt the info?
Traag knowledge is bad.
We don't need it.
We are not tame Oms.
It is great offense!
You must battle according to the Law.
Bring the combat animals!
You win. Stay with us Oms of the Big Tree.
You can be of use to us.
Tomorrow we go on an expedition.
It was my first expedition to steal Traag food.
We brought a great deal back.
Be brave, the Big Tree isn't far.
The Hollow-Bush bandits!
Look out!
Why attack us?
They're from the Hollow Bush.
Beware of them.
They are thieves from the other side of the park.
The Great Zarek
3000 cycles before Krowp...
"created the pyramidic civilization.
"From his tomb - they say he still animates...
"the ball of Life.
"Projectiles pierce him but he does not change.
"His mind travels through Ygam's skies...
"regularly ever since he led the Traags...
"to victory against the Jankos.
"This may well be how Meditation originated.
"Some believe that Zarek is immortal and...
"that from the flames of time he reappears in infinitely varied...
"whirling reality...
"to combat the Traags will to die.
"Actually
"driving out the Jankos made...
"the Traags develop a spirit of enterprise..."
The Oms are learning if only we had more headphones.
You know as much as the Traags.
I am barely learning to write.
Look.
Are you sure?
Did you read it right?
All the park walls read "de-om"!
What does it mean?
The Traags want to kill all the Oms!
Long ago...
I saw them de-om the park.
It was horrible!
But now on our tree, there's not much danger.
What will we do?
- It had to come.
- Anyway, we have time to prepare.
We'll post sentries.
They'll slaughter us... to punish us for stealing knowledge.
Let us pray to the Fantastic Planet.
Sentries will warn us when they come.
Tomorrow we shall see.
What are you doing on our land?
I came to warn you.
The Traags intend to de-om the park.
De-om!
You don't say!
How do you know?
One of us read it on the wall!
Can Big-Tree Oms read Traag writing now?
Don't listen to him!
It's a trap to get us out of the Hollow Bush!
Believe me, the Traags will de-om!
Take him away!
Someone go look at the walls!
Listen!
- Traags!
- Quiet!
I smell Oms here.
That vermin!
The Masters should... de-om more often!
It's not bad to have pet Oms...
They're fun.
But all those wild Oms...
They steal.
They're dirty and multiply appallingly fast.
Look...
A nest by the walk.
See... A whole colony.
Let's kill Them.
Chief is dead.
Stop weeping like children.
We must go where the Traags can't find us.
I know a place,
I'll take you there.
This road leads to an abandoned rocket dump.
We'll be safe there.
I regret that we de-om only every 3 cycles!
This killing proves it is not enough!
A Traag murdered!
It's unbelievable!
Are we so weak that Oms can kill us... so easily?
Wild Oms are much more numerous than we thought.
The body showed many... bites and wounds, said Traag who managed to escape slaughter.
Oms' bites were very numerous.
Every day wild Oms become bolder!
They multiply at a terrifying rate!
Master Sihn, it is disturbing to note that your Uva at Telez is not the only one that has been very difficult to de-om.
Two other Uvas...
Goham and Urtana... have had similar problems...
Near the murdered Traag we found... two surprisingly well organized lairs.
Most disturbing of all was... that in one of the lairs... cases were sorted according to contents.
But they were unopened.
How could the Oms know what they contained?
It is high time to take efficient measures!
I suggest we de-om twice a cycle.
I also request strict regulation of breeding... and selling of tame Oms.
Too often they turn wild again... and go join the throngs of Oms... living in parks and other isolated areas.
We must use the new, much-discussed de-om-ing devices at last.
We must exterminate all wild Oms.
And I ask you:
Should we keep our tame Oms?
We are wrong to believe Oms are merely vicious animals.
If we do, we may commit... an error of serious consequences.
Ygam had..
3 seasons equal to...
15 of our years.
The Traag rocket graveyard was abandoned.
There we built our city.
We planned to go to the Fantastic Planet.
Many tame and wild Oms came to join us.
Knowledge acquired from the headphones... enabled us to reduce...
Traag rockets... to our size.
"Trinur is a metal that palsifies Matwar
"top-grade reculid gives it a remarkable metallic shine."
We have succeeded, Terr.
Two rockets are for testing.
We will start with those.
- It's only a matter of work and time.
- We must hurry!
Om informers say... that a large-scale de-om-ing is near!
They may know where we are.
We must send up our two rockets at once... to see if we can live on the Fantastic Planet.
We cannot wait any longer!
Too bad. I can't go with you.
I'm not afraid.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
I know you will build... a new world where Oms can be happy... far away from the Traags.
The Fantastic Planet will be our planet... a world for our children.
You must go!
You must hurry!
You must...
We had discovered the secret of the Traags.
The Spheres of Meditation there enabled Traags to meet... beings from other galaxies and hold strange nuptial rites.
This union gave them vital energy which they needed... and enabled them to reproduce.
We were afraid...
The statues feet might damage our rockets.
We found the only weak point of the Traags.
On Ygam, the de-om-ing was halted.
Never have the Traags been in such great danger!
Our entire civilization is threatened!
The Oms are taking revenge.
They have incredible scientific knowledge.
They must be stopped!
It may be too late.
Neither Oms nor Traags... will profit from destruction.
We must try to make peace.
"Since the Sihn era,
"the Traag civilization has undergone a remarkable evolution.
"The Oms, instructed by our philosophy and...
"technology...
"now provide the Traags with...
"dynamics and a new way of thinking.
Our planet now has two satellites, one natural and one artificial.
"The natural one, the Fantastic Planet...
"is kept for Traag Meditation.
"The artificial one was made by Oms.
They named it Terr.
"Oms live in huge cities on the various Uvas."

I, Lemuel Gulliver
give thee a faithful history
of my most interesting adventure
in the South Sea.
On the 5th day of November, 1699,
having reached latitude 30 degrees,
two minutes south,
a storm of great fury suddenly...
All's well!
All's well!
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All's well! #
Why do they make me sing that song?
The poet who wrote it was certainly wrong.
It's bright ahead. The light's ahead.
I'd rather go home and go right to bed.
All's well!
My feet are wet and my bunions ache, and yet I've to keep wide awake, all night!
I wake folks up to tell them things are all right!
And, # All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All...
A, A, All's well! Wha, wha, what's a rainy day?
The king has visitors.
Do you know they're signing a wedding contract?
There's a giant on the beach!
There, there's a giant out there!
Your majesty.
Thank you, your majesty.
Marriage Contract
King Little of Lilliput
Does this 5th day of November 1699 give the hand of his daughter
Princess Glory to Prince David son of Bombo
King of Blefuscu!
Quite in order, fine.
King Bombo!
Well we did it, you little rascal, you.
We did it.
Yes we, we certainly did, didn't we?
Just a couple of old dag cupids, I think! [laughs}
Your majesty, the wedding things are here.
There's a giant on the beach!
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
There's a giant on the beach! Let me go!
Exquisite taste, exquisite!
Roses, Freesia, Rhododendrons,
Ranunculus, Snap Dragons, and Daisies.
Ahh!
They're pretty Posies, aren't they?
Beautiful blooms, beautiful!
Oh!
May I?
Oh, please do!
Magnificent!
Oh! A masterpiece!
Vanilla. Wow!
# Faithful. Remember, that whatever I do,
I'm always faithful, my love. #
# Faithful, with all my soul and thankful for you, #
# who came from heaven above. #
# We'll dance tonight together, on a world with me we'll find. #
My only little daughter. I dread losing her.
Huh, Buck up there old boy, you're not losing a daughter. You’re gaining a son.
My son!
# So I'll be faithful and faithful as I promise to be, and you'll be for all mine. #
Hmm. Lovely melody.
Yes, we like it.
That is Faithful. The song of Lilliput.
It will be played at the wedding tomorrow.
Of course. Of course.
What's that, Faithful? Oh, no, no! Forever!
The song of Blefuscu must be played at the wedding.
But Bombo, Faithful is always played at our weddings.
It, it's tradition, sir. And it's very pretty.
Yes, yes, I know. Pleasant little ditty, oh but hardly appropriate for this great occasion.
But Forever! There's a song for you! Ha, ha!
Faithful will be played.
Bah! Fodder. Absolute fodder. It must be Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
It will be Forever, or there will be no wedding!
No wedding? But the cake and the pretty flowers and.. oh Bombo, you'll love Faithful.
Ahh!
It's war!
There's a giant on the beach!
It's war!
War. Woe is me. Woe is me.
I found a mountain, your majesty. I found it!
It was man, a man mountain!
War isn't nice.
It was, was this big!
No, no. It was this big!
People get hurt in wars.
He's as big, as big as, as,.. big as, as, as..
Wait your majesty!
Bombo can't frighten me. No sir.
Don't stand there like a nincompoop!
I'm trying to tell you that there's a giant!
When I get my dandruff up, then look out.
But Glory, poor little Glory.
Don't look now gentleman, but it's war.
War? Whoopee!
# Forever, forever, #
# There won't be anyone but you. #
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #
# Forever, forever, #
# You'll share in everything I do, #
# And keep smiling through, my sweet. #
# I'll have just you here in my heart, #
# And I'll trust you though we're apart. #
# So, forever, forever, #
# My guiding angel you will be. #
# So always have faith in me. #
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
War. Ha. Ha. Rolls off my back like a duck.
But, but I'm, but I'm trying to tell ya!
I'm telling ya there's, there's a...

I said..
Speak up, man.
There's a giant on the beach!
There's a giant on the beach!
For heaven's sake, Gabby.
Button your mouth.
Can't you see I have a war on my hands?
Be off with you. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
A war?
Do you suppose he could be a, a spy?
Who's a spy? Who's a spy?
THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!
A giant? Giant? Why don't you tell me things?
Do something. Don't stand there.
Go. Sic the dogs on him.
Fetch him to me at once!
Wake up! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!
A giant on the beach!
Wake up, I tell ya! Wake up!

Giant on the beach!
Giant!
It's open!
A giant?

Giant!
On the beach!
I said, "There's a giant on the beach!"
Bring cables and tools.
Bring horses and mules.
Bring snippers and clippers, ladders and spools.
Bring Derek the rig, and bring Floyd the jig.
Bring whatchamacallit. Little and big.
A thingamathud. A thingamajig.
And all kinds of things and stuff like that there.
Follow me!
Shh!

Shh!
Hmm!
Shh! Quiet. We're almost there.
Whoaa!
Wh, where, where is it?
I don't know, but it was right here.
Here?
Oh yeah? Well where is it now?
Well ah, ah, I can't understand it.
It was right here.
Honest.
Giant, huh! Dragging us out into the dead of the night.
Yeah, chasing wild geese.
Gabby must have been seeing things.
Maybe it just got up and flew away.
Yeah, and breathing fire.
Look out Gabby.
Your giant's gonna bite ya!
Hey, hey fellas, maybe it was me he saw.
Look. I'm a giant! I'm a giant!
Psst!
Psst! Psst! Psst!
Listen.
I-I... t-t-told ya that there was a-a-a gia, a giant on the b-b-beach.
And well, there he is.
Huh?
HE SAID, "THAT'S THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!"
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
There isn't a moment to waste.
Every last man must do all that he can.
Work with the greatest of haste.
So bind up its hands, its arms, its chest, its neck, its feet!
And I'll do the rest.
Let's go!
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Hey?
Shh!
Careful!
Up!
Put him there! No! No! Here!
Don't be afraid man!
Aw! Aw! He got me! He got me!

He's killing me! Help!
Hey!
Well, what are you rubes waiting for?

Giddy up!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Pull in the ropes there!
Not so fast! Not so fast!
Hurry up, there! Slow down!
Get the wheels past!
Phew! I don't know what they would do around here without ME!
Ohhhh!
Heave! Heave!
Faithful was always played at our weddings... Faithful.
Faithful.
Your, your, your majesty.
Huh?
I've got the giant!
The giant. Oh, yes, yes, the giant.
Well bring him in. Bring him in.
Okay. Okay.
Your majesty, I don't think he'd fit in here.
Oh you don't, huh?
So it's not good enough for him, hmm?
Well where is he?
Out there, your majesty.
Now, then.
Humph! Not good enough for him!
Well, where is he?
From here. On!
Call out the guards, the army, the navy, women and children first, I'll see you later.
Search him, men. He may be armed.
Ohhhh!
Ugh! Why do I get out held?
Your majesty! Let me in!
Look your majesty! Let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!
Help! I don't like this!
Ohhhh!
Let me go! Help! Help!
Let me go! I don't wanna die!
Well, well. what have we got here?
Help! Help!
Don't eat me! Don't eat me!
Help! I won't taste good.
I'll give you indigestion.
A man. A tiny man.
You can't do this to me.
I've got a wife and kids.
Millions of kids.
Hold on there, mate.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Help! Put me down! Help! Help!
Drop that! Drop that!
Well, another one. Who are you?
Who me? What? I'm king around here.
Guards! Guards! To the turrets!
Archers! Surround the giant!
Surround the giant! Guards!
Well.
Huh! You'll pay for this.
Ready!
Aim, fire. Aim, fire.
Aim!
Fire, fire, fire.
How do you like that?
Want some more?
All right, let her go!
It's Bom
Bo!
Force the gates! Man the battlements!
Defend the city!
We're attacked! We're attacked!
Stop! Stop you swine!
Get back to your posts!
Get back there and fight!
We of Blefuscu are not!
... afraid of anything.
Well, where's everyone gone?
This is no way to treat a harmless visitor.
Look Gabby, we've won! Gabby! Gabby?
See Gabby? They've gone.
Yes, sir. Scared stiff.
Hello there.
Come now, don't let my size frighten you.
You, your majesty, surely you're not afraid of me?
Nuh uh.
Well, good. Then let me present myself.
My name is Gulliver, your majesty.
Lemuel Gulliver, a shipwrecked sailor.
At your service.
Well, welcome to Lilliput,
Mr., Mr. Gulliver.
Uh Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?
Well your majesty,
I can lick anybody my size.
Ah, splendid, splendid!
I don't think Bombo will give us any further trouble while you're around here.
No sir!
He's on our side, Gabby.
He's on our side!
There's nothing to fear!
The man mountain's on our side!
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #

Out of soap! Push him up!
Out of soap! Push him up!
Outta the tub! He's a coming up!
Hey look out! Grab it! Pull it off! Nab it!
Pull it off! Take it off!
You understand that not until that giant is removed can our forces taste the sweet fruits of victory!
Now then, it is up to you to carry this message to my spies in Lilliput.
Be off and may luck be with you!
Too-de-loo!
Get going!
Your majesty, I'm sorry the little princess isn't with us.
Yes, too bad. Too much excitement for one day.
Dear spies: Get rid of that Giant or else... Cordially yours King Bombo

# Wherever you may be #
# Come home again you sailor man, sailor man #
# Home again to the sea #
# I hear a dream all day #
# A dream that calls to me #
# Come home again you sailor man, sailor man #
# Home again to the sea #
Ahoy, mate! Ahoy, m...
Ahoy, mate! Ahoy! Ahoy!
I see that you're a sailor boy.
I owned a boat. A beauty, too.
Fifty times as big as your a, as big as your a, as big as your shoe.
My, my.
Hoy, hoy.
Lost her though in a glorious gale, but I came home on the back of a whale.
But tell me though how you caught the whale.
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.
My, my.
I, I,
I climbed a mountain peak so high.
I bumped my head against the sky.
And there I was, where was I?
On the Island of Alibi.
Hoy, hoy.
My, my.
Hi, hi.
But now my life is very dull.
They ought to make me an admiral.
Now that's the job that I'd enjoy.
I must be going. Ahoy! Ahoy!
My, my, my.
You put that ball in there.
And then it goes down and around.
Pull that thing.
And it comes out here.
The g-g-g-g-giant!
Wow!
The light. The light.
Douse the light!
He's gone.
Phew!
Hello! Anybody in there?
Nobody here but just us spi...
Chickens!
My, my.
# Forever, forever, #
# There won't be anyone but you. #
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #
# Forever, forever, #
# La, la, la, la, la, la. #
# Forever, forever, #
Forever! Forever!
That's the song of Blefuscu!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy! A spy!
Charge!
Where is he? Where did he go?
Concealing a spy.
And at a time of war, too.
That makes it worse!
Carry on the search men!
Mind you, your father will hear of this.
King Bombo,
Say the word and the giant is a dead duck.
..is a dead duck.
P.S. What do we do with the body?
Two hearts and a wedding broken by a melody?
Incredible!
Wait a minute.
I have an idea that might turn this malice to a melody!
Sing Faithful and Forever together, as one song.
The giant will be a dead duck.
Ha! Now we are getting at somewhere!
Dear Spies, Destroy. Crush.
Obliterate! Annihilate!
Kill him!
I will attack at dawn!
Affectionately yours, Bombo.
Whatcha got there?
Attack at dawn. Attack..
Bombo's attack.., Bom..., Bom...
Guards! Guards! Guards!
Bombo's attacking! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking at dawn!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Bombo's attacking! It's war! It's war!
It's the end of the ending!
To the beach! To the beach!
Bomb.. attacking!
What?
Bombo attacking!
It's war! It's war!
To the beach! To the beach!
The enemy attacks!
To defend Lilliput.
To defend Lilliput!
Yes, forward march.
Gulliver! Gulliver! Where are you?
Bombo's attacking.
Where are you Gulliver?
We'll be wiped out!
Gulliver where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
It's war! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Put me down.
Hah! Well, where you been you lazy, long legged, overgrown lummox?
Now, get down there to that beach and wipe out that Bombo and that bunch of Blefuscuians.
And tear em to pieces and don't leave a man alive to tell the tale.
Forward march! Get going!
Aye, aye, sir!
My, oh my.
Hey! Wait for me.
Gulliver, wait for me!
Wait for me, Gulliver!
No note.
Where is it?
What did you done with it?
Where did you lose it?
Who's got it now?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Wait for me!
Gulliver! Gulliver!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let's go!
Hold on there!
We can settle this peacefully.
Listen!
Hold you fire!
Hear what I have to say.
Bombo, order your men to lay down their arms.
Must I make you listen?
David, look! Gulliver's thunder machine.
Wait here, Glory.
David!
Fire!
Fire!
Pull! Come on! Pull! Pull!
David!
Poor, poor, foolish little people.
Look what you've done.
Now go ahead! Break your nutshell heads over your songs!
But did you have to break Glory's heart,
King Little, because you are thoughtless and selfish?
And you Bombo, o mighty warrior, what have you won?
You were too stubborn to think, too busy quarrelling to lend ear to the harmony that might have been yours.
But now in your sorrow and despair, perhaps you will listen to your songs as they might be sung.
# Faithful forever whatever I do #
# Remember I'm true, #
# remember that #
# Faithful forever and thankful for you #
# I'll keep smiling through, #
# remember that #
# We may be apart now and then #
# But I'll hold you in my heart #
# Till you're in my arms again #
# Faithful forever I promise to be #
# So always have faith in me #
In behalf of the peoples of
Blefuscu and Lilliput,
With eternal gratitude and love in our hearts, we christen thee, Gulliver!
# Come back again, come back #
# Wherever you may be #
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #
# Back again from the sea #
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #
# Back again from the sea #
-- The End --
Jump back, baby.
Fritz, did you go down and see the welfare people today?
Yeah. They told me to report someplace tomorrow.
I got it written down on a piece of paper, I think.
Listen, are you gonna go?
I don't know. Let's fuck.
Then will you go out and look for a job like you said?
What? Did I say that?
Man, oh, man, am I stoned!
How is it a grown man can spend so much time... just dreaming about what he's gonna do for his family?
For Christ's sakes!
Will you come down to Earth?
What we need is the basic staff of life!
Like grub!
I never saw anybody walking around more stoned than you.
Always stoned!
Where do you get the money to buy that grass?
Will you tell me?
You and your Acapulco Gold.
You know what that is?
That's shit!
Which is what you are!
You are shit, Fritz!
Here's something you don't know.
Harvey and I made it.
What do you think of that?
We made it, and he's better in bed than you are.
You know why?
He's hung like a horse.
What about you?
You're nothing.
You're nothing in the living room.
You're nothing in the bathroom.
You're nothing in bed.
You don't even change the damn roller on the toilet paper.
I'm the one that uses that mostly.
And what about putting the seat down?
Why don't you ever do that?
Why don't you take that chicken-shit grin off your face?
Fritz! You're a no-good!
How much can a person take?
And why don't you ever put the goddamn seat down... when you're through peeing?
You rotten putz, you!
That's all you do is sit around.
I never saw anything like it in my entire life!
You know what
I would like to do to you?
I would like to take you and shake you... until all your teeth fall right onto the floor... and then you know what I'd do?
I'd stamp on them, all the teeth... and I'd make them right into powder.
And then I'd sprinkle the powder right over your head.
And then I would knock you right in the goddamn face!
I'd like to pulverize you!
I'd take your nose... and I'd put it across the room on the wall.
I'd like to knock you into next week sometimes!
This is it, Fritz.
I'm really sore.
Now, I'm really sore.
I am sick to death!
I'm gonna tell you one time and one time only... so you better listen to me... because if you don't listen to me now...
I ain't gonna say it again.
I'll go out and get myself a two by four... and beat your fucking head in!
You are gonna pick up after yourself.
From now on, I'm through picking up after you.
And you will put the seat down on that goddamn toilet!
I'm telling you one time and one time only.
You're a no-good bum, and I've had it with you, Fritz!
I have had it with you!
And let me tell you something else.
I know you play around.
Don't try to lie to me.
You don't even have a guilty look on your face.
You really don't give a goddamn.
I know that you're playing around.
Don't think I haven't seen you.
I get telephone calls from girls.
They call me up.
God knows why they want you.
Don't they know how shitty you are in bed?!
Hey, man, don't do that.
What? Do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
What the hell are you laying on me, man?
I ain't laying nothing on you, man.
It's what you laid on me.
No need to be crude.
God damn it, you freaking out or something?
Look, Juan, if we can just cash this welfare check... we can get us some Rip Bull or maybe even some muscatel.
Kiss off, dude!
That's your problem.
You ain't got the guts to admit when you're wrong.
You just passed gas at me, man, and that's uncool.
Oh, wow.
Don't have the guts to confess you're a goddamn coward.
You're just like my sister.
Well, you P.R.s are hypersensitive, you know?
I thought you and me were friends.
A little wig out,
I'm a religion now, huh?
A P.R., huh? Nice.
Hey, about your sister,
Juan... does she have big tits?
I wish you people would learn to speak English.
Christ knows we were here first.
It's the only way I talk to a man who has habits like a pig.
Man, don't be that way.
Let's get some wine and go see your sister... and maybe we can get it on.
Beats the hell out of freezing our balls off, right?
No deal, man.
I can't trust you no more.
I can't let you fuck my sister, you know?
You got no class, man.
You wouldn't let me fuck your sister.
Why should I let you fuck mine?
Listen, your sister is some piece of ass.
I know, man. Yeah.
My sister?
Wow, man,
I can't believe that.
Yeah, man, you better believe it.
She was a female creature of tender passion... of simple earthen charm, you know?
Wow, dude, that's good.
Yeah, you could say that.
Juan, you better get back in the phone booth again.
I feel a fart coming on.
Check it out.
We done came all the way across town... done caught busses and cars and hitchhiked to get here... then put on our best clothes... so we can walk in this neighborhood... so we can get in one of these white houses... to rip off one of them
$400 televisions... one of them $300 watches... one of them
Panasonic, rena-sonic... exto-sonic, plesto-plastic stereos.
With the quadro-flex, modu-lextic... medu-modula needles and shit...
Big-time shit, man.
I ain't never heard of nothing like that.
You ain't in this community, blood!
That's why we came here, you know what I'm saying?
You don't know what you doing, man.
I also be doing this big-time organizing and shit.
You ripping off washing machines and toilet paper.
Unusual odd shit.
Now you know why we here.
OK, now... we gonna crawl in this here window, all right?
You take the downstairs, and I'll take the upstairs.
Why is it that I always got to take the downstairs?
Beause you don't like jumping out of windows, man.
Shit!
Now, will you cut that out, Fritz?
Hey!
The beauty of cannabis.
And then once we get inside, get everything-- don't get no washing machines-- then leave.
Somebody's home!
Doesn't it fill you with joy?
Is that cat smoking?
The unfettered exuberance, the lust for life?
It makes you...
Look how he's smoking weed. want to drop your phony inhibitions... and love your fellow man?
Look at that chick with them titties!
Or brother, maybe.
Doesn't it? Huh?
It is Juan's sister.
Don't you kind of see things more clearly, huh?
That's right.
Take a good, long drag, sis.
Now breathe in the smoke.
Deep.
It'll help clear your sinuses.
Hey, I feel light-headed.
That is Juan's sister, man!
He's going to the store!
Looks like a feature film, you know what I mean?
Right on.
Will it really expand my...awareness?
Well, you know what they say...
"Take tea and see."
Doesn't clear my sinuses at all.
Daddy says you're only good for getting the papers.
Is that all you're good for, Fritz?
That's some kick, huh?
You know the most interesting thing about smoking?
It causes excessive perspiration... and a person has to take off all his clothes.
Otherwise, he can drown to death in his own juices.
Now, this activity is like artificial respiration.
Smoke some more of this shit.
Fuck them.
If I get up in this pad,
I got the downstairs--
-Hold it in.
-I'll knock it out.
You'd knock it out, you'd what?
I love my brother's friends.
Man, he ought to put a bag over that ugly bitch's head.
Stick her head in the couch, man.
Before I stick my thing in her...
-Look at them fuck.
-Man, hold up.
Makes me kind of horny, man.
-Yeah.
-Let's rob.
Duck, man. There's a car coming up the driveway.
I bet it's her old man.
Is this good for the liver?
Oh, Fritz. That's good!
Chita!
That's the ugliest motherfucker.
Daddy!
Look at that snaggle-toothed... big, greasy, fucking nasty pig.
Gee, pops, maybe I should go get the papers, huh?
Papers?! Why, you, you!
Little son of a bitch.
What do you want, pops,
News or the Times?
Pink commie bastard!
Shit.
I guess you killed him, right in the ass.
I guess we can't rob this pad today, huh?
We'll come back tomorrow.
My sister was once in psychoanalysis.
She says you're a boy who would fuck his mother.
And what have you done for Ralphie?
Other than to teach him how to masturbate?
And left-handed, no less.
You must be new around here.
I haven't seen your face before.
My old lady kicked me out of the house.
I've had this streak of bad luck lately... and she's been making noise
I should go find work.
What'd you say, something about work?
Everybody knows that's what kills a man.
Starts out with an eight-hour day... forty hours a week... and, hell, boy, before you know it... you're married to some fine-ass woman and buying a house.
I'll help you.
Yeah, that's terrible.
Work is terrible.
What the hell do you get for it, anyway?
Jeez, I don't know.
It's just money is all.
It's evil.
I tell you, it's evil.
It all starts from having to work.
Now, if you don't have to work... why, you don't get any money.
You know what I mean?
It's that simple.
Yeah. That's what
I try to tell my old lady.
She sent my ass down to the welfare office again... and those creeps started to hit on me... about receiving public assistance for over a year... and here was my last--
Are you OK?
It's my last check and all... and I had failed to find employment again.
It's just too much bullshit, so I split.
It doesn't pay to hit the big time.
-No.
-Yeah.
Oh, wow.
Well, you got any plans, son?
Oh, yeah.
I figured I'd settle down here.
Get away from all the zipper-heads uptown.
Not get involved with all the extemporaneous bullshit.
And, hey, by the way, what's your name?
Oh, I'm God.
Wow, man, that is heavy.
You're really God, huh?
No shit?
You OK?
I've been God for about three and a half years now.
A lot of responsibility, you know.
I'll bet.
Also, I'm black belt karate.
No shit?
Wow, this really blows my mind.
Me, I'm standing here rapping with God.
Far out!
You want to be my assistant?
Well...
I might be forced to give up my job.
I can't keep busting my ass this here way.
Anyway, I've been into some heavy gear in one of my lives.
I got nine of them, pal.
I got hung up with the weirdest dude one time... you could ever imagine.
This guy I'm thinking of was really psycho... you wouldn't believe it.
Jesus.
Wow, God, you really do some weird shit, you know?
Make the fucking world in seven days--try it sometime.
Work your vanilla!
Oh, the Yanks are coming!
And remember, your fathers and mothers... and all of your Fatherland will be watching you.
Envying in the great glory... for which you have been selected... you all have promised to die for the Fuhrer.
Who wants to be next?
Ooh! Oh, Mama!
Mama, was Papa ever like this?
Mein Fuhrer, the bombs have just killed your orderly!
Ah, another orderly gone.
Get me another one!
Order another orderly quickly!
Another orderly quickly!
Another orderly!
Another orderly for the Fuhrer!
Put up an "Out of Orderly" sign!
-Harder!
-I get excited! Good!
My Lenore!
My liebchen!
Ohh! Hans!
I mean, he was--ohh!
Hans, I'm sorry. I--
Stand aside!
Oh, he was so wonderful!
Oh, Hans!
I mean, he was--
My aching swastika!
I thought being a Nazi as all "Sieg, Sieg"... and "Sieg Heil!"
This is for shit!
I better get my ass the fuck out of here.
War is hell!
Mein Fuhrer, here are the candidates for your orderly.
Heil Hitler!
Sieg heil!
That one!
I want that one!
Him! That's him!
Excuse me, Fuhrer.
I didn't mean to stare.
What is it? You see something missing maybe?
No, no!
Everything's fine... but you've only got one ball.
Everybody in the Third Reich has to do without something!
I see.
When the Fuhrer is naked, everyone is naked!
Well, here I am, aren't l?
Hi.
Imbecile. Imbecile.
Don't you know what is expected of you now?
What? I think you dropped something.
What? I dropped something?
I put the soap in your hand, you see... and you seem to have let it go.
Dropped it, like... almost like you weren't interested in washing at all!
I was not conscious of this.
It is simple to see,
Mein Fuhrer.
You're real motivations are blocked here.
Blocked?
What is blocked?
It's a new word.
It means what's inside can't get outside.
Some kind of
Freudian horseshit.
Oh, inside, can't get out...
You're a nice boy.
I'm going to make a confession.
Sometimes, I would like to be a ballet dancer.
Really? No kidding?
I often see myself in the opera.
Oh, wow.
And the people are applauding me!
Well, sure they would.
There you go! You see?
That means this whole number you're doing-- this conquest of the world thing... or whatever it is, is just to get attention.
Interesting you should say that... but I am washing, see, now?
So why did I drop the soap?
Well, that, my dear Herr Hitler... is a question you must ask yourself... when you wrestle with the true identity, you know.
I mean, in the dawning of self-awareness... between you and your pillow, man... when after the labors of sleepless nights... you gained the exalted heights of the altar of truth!
You have insight.
When I see something
I want, I grab it.
Sure, why not?
And my stomach doesn't stop to ask my head if it's hungry.
No, that figures.
By the way, what is your name?
Fritz.
Well, Fritz, you say you once had three balls?
Yeah.
Would you like to try for one?
I don't--Sir!
Listen--OK, OK!
Now, look,
I'm gonna pick up the soap.
I am. Just wait.
I'm gonna bend over now.
Just...
I'm gonna--
Hey, watch it, will ya?!
Mein Fuhrer, wait!
Oh, my God, wait!
Ich bin der fuhrer!
Gee, Fuhrer, now you got no balls.
Mein Fuhrer!
Gentlemen, we can no longer continue.
War is just a question of balls.
Ja, balls.
Goebbels.
Goebbels, are you not... my most loyal and truthful assistant?
Jawohl, Mein Fuhrer.
Did you not invent the slogan which binds all us Nazis?
Jawohl, Mein Fuhrer.
And what is that slogan?
Death before dishonor.
What an asshole slogan.
You can always change the slogan.
You must think of Fraulein Braun.
She needs you.
Ja, think of Eva.
How she would miss you, Adolf.
That's right.
After all, who could take my place?
Sieg heil!
I got that Nazi rat bastard... right between the crack in his ass!
Now how do those sons of bitches expect to win a war... when they're out of goddamn uniform, huh?
I don't have any time to do anything for myself!
I don't even have time to get myself a new diaphragm!
If you hold it up to the light, you can see little pinholes.
Fritz, I'm tired of plugging it up with Chapstick!
Out of my shop.
I won't cash your check... and there's no such thing as a refund on those things... just 'cause you say it don't fit quite right.
But it's never been used, Niki.
I'll even take a prorated refund.
It was used!
Well, only a little, a quickie.
And I bet I know who this was used on, too, huh?
OK, Niki, you're on.
Try to guess who.
Let's see now.
With your filthy taste...
Iet's see, it must be a fat one, right?
Yeah, right. Go on.
And I just bet she sweat a lot, and she smell like a goat, huh?
Right.
And she's got bad breath, no teeth?
Yes! Go on!
You're getting warmer!
And she's got big, hairy... goddamn moustache on the top lip!
Oh, you got me, Niki.
You got me nailed, man.
And I'll bet... that fucking whore been with every guy on this block, right?
Right!
Niki, you're a genius!
Niki, you only left out one thing.
What did I leave out, Fritz?
You know what?
She's got the clap!
That's right!
How could I skip that?
That's a nice one.
She got to have the clap, right?
She has to.
-Hey, Fritz.
-Shit.
Fritz, I'll tell you something.
You're not so bad, you know?
Maybe I'll cash your check after all.
Hey, Fritz, tell me... what's this fat whore pig's name, huh?
-What's the broad's name?
-Gina.
-Hey, Fritz.
-What?
That's a-my wife's name.
Gina is my wife's name.
She don't have the clap.
She does now.
Why, you--
You fucking cat,
I rip your balls off!
Get the fuck out of my shop!
Fuck off! You fucking cat!
I kill you!
I fuck you in the ass!
Fritz, man, what's all this noise about, man?
I can hear all the way from the alley.
Don't even come here!
Aw, nothing.
Niki can't take a joke.
He takes things too seriously.
It's hard not to around here.
Gets pretty fucking deadly sometimes.
I heard it was better years ago, you know what I mean?
But, Lenny, things have always been, more or less... up-and-down situation.
This street wasn't always a shit-house, let me tell ya.
And even as far back as the thirties... there were those who gave and those that took.
Aw, Fritz, but what do I do with this here thing?
You can have it.
I'm done with it anyway.
When I was back in the thirties...
I was one very sharp continental-type stud.
The only thing we have to fear is... fear itself.
People must have faith.
Together...we cannot fail.
And it is up to you... to support...and make it work.
Hey, putz!
Your idea of helping out with the gas shortage... was to stop eating pizza... and bring home four of your hooker friends... to sleep with us at night to stimulate heat.
Look, I don't know how you can own a business... and not be able to cash... this miserable pittance of a welfare check is all.
If I give you all my money...
I'll have nothing left to buy with.
Oh, Christ, then you are in luck, Morris.
Look at this. Knowing of your love for the unusual...
I've brought you something you won't be able to resist.
-I know it.
-Resist?
Believe me, I could resist.
Just look at it, Morris-- the design, the gentle contours.
Why, it's almost Louis Quinze for Christ's sake.
It's disgusting, for Christ's sake.
It's the type of item that will sell so fast... you'll be pleading for more inside of a week, believe me.
It's been used. I can tell.
What? Used?
By a little old lady.
A one-owner shitter-- and genteel.
That's gentile, you stupid bastard.
Don't get hosteel.
That's "hostile."
You're taking the wrong approach, Morris.
Now, some of my best friends are Jewish.
Do I look like the Chase Manhattan Bank?
You come in here with out-of-money look in your face.
Look like you got hit in the head with a foul pitch... and you want to sell me this.
But with inflation, the value of a dollar going down... my expenses skyrocketing...
Why, even this week, the price of a decent circumcision... something I shudder to think about.
I agree with you there... but what's that got to do with my toilet seat?
That's the point, my friend.
My old seder used to say to me...
"Morris, take a pickle.
It's made for eating."
The thing you're holding is made for shitting.
It's simple logic.
You could even be a Rockefeller.
It's tough to find a good pickle.
Socioeconomically speaking, you're absolutely correct, but--
Look, Fritz... the pickles are beginning to get to me.
And these days, a soft stool is too important to me... for something to quibble, so I'll make you a deal.
Tell you what I'm going to do.
You give me the seat,
I'll trade for you a bargain.
Where did you get this thing?
Questions--youth, all the time, questions.
Nowadays people don't know an opportunity... when it smacks them upside of the face.
I think I've been screwed.
With that, you could be the next man on the moon.
Fuck the moon.
I been further than that once.
That's no big deal.
I'd rather take a shit.
So would l.
Give me the seat.
I'm going to hit you on the top of the head.
This should cure you.
Here we go. I say heal!
Heal, Mr. Cobbs, heal!
Through the power vested in me by God, Jesus Christ...
I'm going to heal you, Mr. Cobb.
Hello, world.
This is the event mankind has been waiting for-- the first man launched to Mars.
Fritz, I got to tell you something right out in front.
If it wouldn't be for this fucking cold...
I'd be going all the way to Mars with you.
39 million miles--a drop kick.
But the doc says
I can't fly with this cold.
It's bad for the ears.
He said something about me popping a drum or something...
I don't know.
Jeez, I got to get some more Binaca.
Put that in my bring-ups, will you?
Fritz, you know how I hate to bother you... when you're getting near the pad... but we got to make a decision on the Poli-Grip account.
I can see you with a package of five spots... for the Japanese and Taiwan market.
Incidentally, the residuals will be unreal.
It's eight million yen for every thirteen-week cycle... and you don't have to declare it.
You know, there's a whole cult... of denture-adhesive freaks out there... just waiting for a leader.
Some of them still got their own teeth.
Am I bothering you with all this, Fritz?
My God, Fritz,
I got to get some air in here.
I feel myself slipping away.
Now, I know you're against charities... and benefits and freebies... but hear me out on this one, Fritzie.
There's a nationwide charity telethon coming up... the first of next month... for the further development of all-vegetable... organically-grown polyunsaturated Preparation H-- with suntan oil.
Jerry Lewis is going to be there--everybody.
And before you shut me off,
I got to tell you... the exposure will be sensational for you.
And we might even have a spin-off... on a new movie that's coming out... with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello... called "Beach Ball Piles."
Well, Fritz, I see we arrived at the pad... so this will give you some things to think about... on a 39-million mile trip.
And remember, Fritz, sweetheart,
I'd be with you all the way... it wouldn't be for this fucking cold.
Hot damn.
That chick wouldn't look bad... holding up a Hershey's bar, would she?
With nuts.
Ah, freedom of the press.
Jeez, I feel sorry for the poor slob.
I wouldn't make that trip with him with six points.
Hey, Fritz, baby, want to talk to Walter?
Sure. Why not?
Fritz, does being the first to set foot on Mars-- golly--kind of give you goose bumps?
Ahem. Gentlemen,
I've been up and down... the four corners of this big old world... and I've seen it all, and I've done it all.
I've fought many a good man and laid many a good woman.
And I've had riches, fame, and adventure, too.
Yes. I've stood eyeball-to-eyeball with death... countless times and never, never once squinted.
Oh, I've tasted life to the fullest... and still my tortured soul cries out--more!
More! Oh, shit!
God, can there be any more?
How do it feel, Fritz?
I mean,
Mars ain't around the corner.
You're so right.
Hey, would you like to discuss this in private?
Gee, you got a lovely pair of eyes.
In private?
Sure. Listen, doll...
I'd kind of like to give you a break.
You know, kind of help pay back... for what my people did to your people.
Yeah? What kind of a break?
Well, you know, an exclusive-- an inside story.
Fritz, wait a second!
Wait! Come on, what about us?
What about a statement?
Give us a break, man, come on.
Baby.
We interrupt this telecast of the first flight to Mars... for a message of real importance.
As chairman of the board of the Golf Oil company... with its 13,000 dealers from coast-to-coast...
I want to welcome you all to this momentous event.
When you drive into one of our Golf stations... say howdy to the man who polishes your window... and we'll say howdy right back at you.
At this very minute... you can look at one of our own Golf refineries... pumping away seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day... filling your tanks with gasoline.
We at Golf Oil are bringing you this telecast... in appreciation of the millions of happy Golf customers... when they say, "Fill 'er up."
What's that I hear?
Jeez, look at the money they put in that rocket.
You could buy time on "The Waltons"... for a year with that kind of bread.
I wonder how you put a deal like that together.
That's fascinating.
We have ignition.
Me, too!
Baby!
So unbelievable.
My brother-in-law would like a rocket like that.
Shit.
That's fascinating.
Gee, look at that.
Well, there he goes.
When he gets back, we'll make millions.
Jeez, I hope they got that explosion on tape.
It'd be perfect for our forest lawn spots.
Mr. Cobb. Heal, Mr. Cobb.
Yeah. Heal.
Through the power vested in me by God, Jesus Christ...
I'm going to heal you, Mr. Cobb.
Let me make one thing very clear--
I am not a crook.
Why don't you climb up off your ass?
Remember I was telling you you should get to be... a contestant on "Let's Make a Deal"?
I'll tell you what.
You dress up like a frog.
You look good in green.
And wear a yarmulke.
I think he likes Jewish people.
Man, am I hung up, strung out, and uptight.
Hey. God damn it,
I know that laugh.
Man, it couldn't be.
Hey, man. You in a bag.
Hey, Duke, is it really you?
No shit.
But I thought you were dead.
I thought they got you.
Fritz, you ain't changed a bit.
You still don't know where it's at.
What are you doing down here, anyway?
I'm looking for the true meaning of my existence, as usual.
I got tired of the pseudointellectuals... and the super-hype bullshitters running the world... determining my destiny.
You dig it?
And crushing my creative juices?
Now lay the straight line on me.
My old lady kicked my ass out.
That's what I figured.
But you know, Duke... it's going to be better for all of us, really.
No shit.
Ain't I heard that somewhere before?
That's no bullshit.
There's better days ahead,
I kid you not.
We brothers got some great times rolling our way, man.
-Now you brothers, huh?
-Right on.
Shit. No telling how black we'll be... by the time this little chat ends.
Take my word for it. I know.
Hey, Duke, you ever hear of New Jersey?
Sure.
You ever heard of Ray Charles?
Yeah. Hey, and I'll tell you... you crows are finally going to come into your own.
You wait and see.
Jive sucker come into the ghetto, talking some stuff.
Ought to cut the jive mother.
Twenty-five.
Ready, aim, fire!
Twenty-six.
Hey, man, your number's up.
Come on, let's get to this.
But--look, please, sir... you got the wrong guy, see?
Don't push!
At least let me tell you the way it happened, fella, huh?
Go over to the White House and pick up a package.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President.
You've got to do something.
Believe me, there's nothing to worry about.
Nothing to worry about?
This--what's his name...
Imaku.
Whatever--is suggesting... that New Africa make a federation with Cuba...
China, Africa, and Northern lreland.
I never did trust a nigger.
But you voted in favor of giving them New Jersey.
The final solution to the schwartzen problem... you said.
And we get rid of the Puerto Ricans... and you can't get a decent shoeshine... in the whole of America.
I haven't seen a decent football game in ten years.
Honduras beat us in the Olympics.
You know what that means?
We have a whole country full of niggers-- angry niggers, right across the river from New York.
They could fart and destroy Washington.
All we have to do... is keep President
Supreme Jackson in office.
Come in.
Mr. President,
I'm from the messenger service.
It's about time.
Now, deliver this to President Supreme Jackson.
In New Jersey?
I mean, New Africa?
Well, that's where he is.
But I heard these crows don't let whites in their country.
How long have you been... with the Red Arrow delivery service?
Today's my first day.
I used to be on welfare.
Go to the motor pool and get a car and a pass.
Yes, sir.
Remember, this is important... to our national security, so don't fail.
I won't fail, sir.
Please.
Stop kissing my hand.
-Yes, sir.
-And touching my palms.
Can I help you?
I want to see the man in charge.
I'm in charge here.
I came to get a car and a pass into New Africa.
OK, I'll get you a car and a pass to Niggerville.
This is a rotary engine Mazda.
Them niggers will steal anything they can.
No sense in risking a new car to go over there.
We ain't got anybody to wash 'em up no more.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Come here.
If you're going to New Africa...
I got a wife and kid over there.
They had to go with their people... when they gave the blacks
New Jersey.
-No shit?
-Could you kind of--
Well, there's a lot of blacks.
You were married to a colored woman?
Shit. That's ten years in the slammer.
Yeah. Look, I don't expect you to look for 'em... but if you should happen to see 'em... will you tell 'em l-- tell 'em I said hi.
I wonder if they're still over there?
OK. Your pass is good. Go on.
Oh, hey, how do I find
President Supreme Jackson?
Wave a dollar bill.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah. Black is beautiful.
Like they say, huh?
I hears de gentle voices
Hey, man.
-Roscoe, dere, dere.
-What?
That broad, man.
That ugly broad.
Hey, man.
Ain't you going to say hello to your old lady?
-Watch out, now.
-That bitch is too ugly... for you to say hello to in public.
Shoot. I'd go with her a lot quicker... than I'd go with your mama.
Shoot. She's so ugly... your daddy don't even want to go with her.
Shit! Look who's talking.
Shit, if ugliness was electricity... your mama would be walking in a powerhouse.
Oh, man, dig that.
That's light shit.
Your mama look like ten miles of bad road, nigger.
Your mama got a face... that look like it been run over by a bus... and everybody kept telling how good she looking till you.
And then--so she's been jumping in front of buses ever since.
Man, I don't want to hear that.
Oh, hey, look at that.
Boy, some pair of gazongas there.
That isn't bad.
A little young.
But, then, what the hell.
These chicks know where it's at by the time they're 1 1 anyway.
How do I get to the Black House?
You take the number twenty bus on the corner.
You do know what a corner is, don't you, honky?
Somebody help.
Help!
Hey, man. Come on, help me, man, please.
Oh, man. What's the matter?
Well, a gang, man.
They robbed--
-Oh, Jesus.
-Help me, man.
Hey, help!
There's a man hurt in the alley.
Help me, somebody!
-Where?
-Back here.
He hurt bad?
Look, man, there's a phone down the block.
Go and call an ambulance.
Hello?
Operator, give me the hospital.
Give you what?
A hospital--sick, doctor, pain, hurt, you know.
Just a minute, mister.
You looking for a Dr. Sax?
Information number 30-70.
Is that 13-17, or is that 30-70?
-You making fun of me?
-No, I just wanted to get--
Sound like you white.
You white?
What's that got to do with anything?
Honky, what you doing talking on a New African phone?
Trying to get a hospital.
You're going to need one the way you making fun of people.
Look, all I want to know... is if the number is
13-17 or 30-70 or what.
You such a smart ass, you figure it out.
My opponent is accusing me of dodging the issues.
Let me say this about that.
Issues is the only thing
I'm not dodging.
Hey, two more of the same.
What am I going to do, man?
I mean, I work.
I think I look good.
I'm still young.
You know, I might have about five children.
And when I saw Jimi Hendrix...
I'd never saw anybody play guitar, play like--
He took a guitar one time and took-- he had it round his neck, right?
And there was a girl in the audience... that he was dedicating the song to... and he took it, spun it around his neck, right?
He's got it on his neck, right?
Just going around.
Then he takes it... throws it down between his legs and jerks it off.
He jerks it off, man.
I couldn't believe it.
And then threw her right back around his-- and then started playing with his teeth.
That's right. That's him.
And then--after he played it with his teeth... he dropped it down on the ground... took some lighter fluid...
You see it on the album cover.
I decided that I just wanted to be a prostitute.
Oh, honey.
Wait a minute, baby.
I just want to do my thing, baby.
They tell me I can get me some furs.
How you doing?
Hey, pal...
Nigger, you stepped on my shine!
What's wrong with you?
You better get the fuck outta my face.
-What you talking about?
-I'll cut you. Shoot you.
Man, nigger, step outside!
Listen, nigger, you better back off!
I'll cut you from here to tomorrow!
Back up?
Ooh, that's right!
I'll cut you so goddamn fast you won't bleed till tomorrow.
Too easy.
Have you got change for a dollar?
Well, now, looky here!
A real live white!
Isn't anybody gonna break up that fight?
Them niggers don't fight, sucker.
Shit! They just roughin'.
What's a whitey doing in this joint?
-Here you go.
-Thanks. You got a phone?
It got ripped off.
There's one down the street.
Help! Somebody! Police!
I got five dollars say you ain't gonna buy that number.
In fact,
I put my gold teeth on it... you can't make that number with a pencil and a sheet of--
Who goes there?
-Excuse me.
-Don't bother me. I'm hot.
Can you tell me where to find
President Supreme Jackson?
This jive motherfu--
He's right inside.
Go ahead.
You can't make that money.
Come on seven.
Bet five.
Now what is it?
Message from the White House.
The honky prez.
-The White House?
-Gimme the message.
What does it say?
It says that we attempt an assassination... and blame it on lmaku, man.
Attempt to assassinate who?
You, fool!
Don't worry, man.
We'll get an expert shot, man, and all he'll do is wound you.
Wound me?
We got to make it look real.
Fuck that shit. I ain't gonna let nobody shoot me.
The answer is no.
Man, I ain't gonna lose this election.
If I got to get shot you are!
Not necessarily.
Fritz? General Jones wants to talk to you!
OK, thanks.
I'm from--
I know where the hell you from--
-Don't anybody move!
-What's this?
We found you was bugging our conference... spying on the movements, tapping the telephones... and telling the papers
I use hair straightener!
How dare you.
-Where's Jackson?
-He's dead.
Don't you bullshit me!
I'm not.
Killed by an American spy.
What? I didn't kill anybody.
Why would they kill Jackson?
'Cause Jackson was a real brother.
Ain't gonna let this murder go unavenged!
The council has just declared war... on the United States, and dig that!
I thought you said we were going to lose in two or three days.
It's been two weeks.
Where's all that war reparations money... we was supposed to get?
All them PXs and black market cigarettes?
Now, give me a chance to get my head together, man.
Now what is it?
The President of the United States.
Mr. Speaker,
Mr. Vice President...
Iadies and gentlemen, as Commander in Chief... of all the United States military forces...
I surrender.
What? Surrender?
What the hell you mean, surrender?!
You better get back to fighting.
You folks ain't never lost a war.
-Shit, you can win!
-We getting them whiteys back?
Unconditional surrender.
That's your ass, Jones.
For crimes against the Sovereign
Republic of New Africa... and the assassination... of our beloved
President Supreme Jackson... you've been ordered executed this day.
You got a last request?
Yes. Please don't shoot me.
Ready...aim...fire!
I bet you voted for Nixon!
Did you by any chance,
Mr. Smart Ass... pop some of my birth control pills?
Oh, shit!
Ralphie just peed on my shoes!
Christ, is it refreshing to get away... from the pressures of the street.
There's much to be said for the advantages of isolation.
It allows one total freedom to pick and choose... without the forces of society to wear you down.
Take the example of the influence... of our present-day culture.
It typifies humanity's lack of personal concern for others.
Hey, fuck you, you inconsiderate bastards!
You just sit there on your fat asses... and dump on life indiscriminately.
I suppose I should learn to accept... the miniscule distractions of life, though.
Oh, shit!
The sacred horn of Vishnu wakes you up.
Do wake up, please, young Caucasian...
'cause I've come to save your very soul.
What? You sure you want me?
It is not possible that I could be in error.
You see, my good book here, it guides me as I wander... through the vast cosmic universe of my experience... with astral flash and good vibes as my bedfellows.
Wait a minute.
I can't get behind that really.
Aren't those the yellow pages?
Oh, man.
Could you not do that?
Please to wash my feet.
Wash my feet, Caucasian one.
Especially the left one.
Only this morning,
I stepped in sacred cow shit.
Wow, man. Hold on now.
I'm not really into washing cow shit off anybody's feet.
This is truly a bad omen.
I, Javral Ben Roderiga... son of the most ample
Javral Ben Roderiga Sr... have been truly affronted.
Look, I didn't mean to offend you, man.
Silence.
There is no need to explain.
Oh, yeah, this is nice.
Very nice.
The brass horn of Vishnu announces... that I am the second of two sent from the East.
Two also were sent from the West.
No matter.
It was to cure those, those poor unfortunates... afflicted with the leprosy.
Jeez, that's really a shame, because I've seen... a lot of disease down here, but no leprosy--so far.
No leprosy?
No running sores?
Nothing like that.
This is most disturbing news.
But chronic backache?
None of my friends have that, either, I don't think.
Well, then perhaps the dreaded dandruff... or the very heartbreak of psoriasis?
No. I'll tell you the truth.
I think you're a little late.
See, I think that went down a long time ago.
I could tell you a story, if you'd care to--
If you could possibly make it short... because there is a strong possibility... that I should be in Philadelphia.
Jesus, this stuff is dynamite.
The eyes of my own soul staring back at me.
God knows I've lived the best lives I was capable of.
My minor infractions of society's rules were only due--
Oh, please, Lucifer, don't take me!
I'm not ready! I'll change!
I'm already changing.
Look at me change.
Oh, my God, what a way to go.
Excuse me, certainly.
Hello?
Yoo-hoo down there.
Excuse me.
Did anyone find an earring?
I dropped my earring in the trash. You'd recognize it.
It opens on one side.
Kind of a jade color.
It's got a picture of Errol
Flynn and Alan Hale naked--
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Lucifer's a faggot!
Jesus Christ, my life is shit!
I had to get knocked up.
I could've had an abortion.
No. Mr. Good-Time Charlie over there.
"No," he says.
"Have the baby.
"We'll get married.
I'll take care of you."
What'll you take care of?
It's a good thing we got Ralphie.
Otherwise, we don't even get welfare.
Will you tell me one thing you ever did for my Ralphie?
Do you ever play with him?
Do you ever take him to the ballgame?
Do you ever take him fishing?
How about fishing?
Why don't you take your own son fishing?
You don't even change his kitty litter!
Did you know that Dr. Spock... has stated very clearly in his book... that fathers who are never there... usually makes a fag kid?
Do you know what he does most of the time around the house?
If he's not picking his nose, he's jerking off.
How's that gonna look when he starts kindergarten?
Suck my dick, huh?
You get outta here!
Pack your things and get out!
I said get out, and I mean it!
While I'm still young enough... to find a decent father for my child, you bum.
All you do is lay around.
Listen, I'm sick of cleaning up after you.
And don't think I don't know that you fool around.
I know it.
You junkie, you hophead, you.
Are you kidding?
No, I'm not.
I'm sick of seeing you... sitting around here doing nothing.
Get serious!
Don't come back here until you're ready to shape up!
Too much. I thought she was putting me on.
Hey, she actually did it.
That blows my mind.
Hey, I don't have to go to the welfare office tomorrow.
Jesus! Wow!
Know what that is?
That's shit!
You are shit!
Know what? Know what?
She's got the clap!
Some of my best friends...
When he gets back to Earth.
This is about the worst life I ever had.
LEGO The Adventure of Clutch Powers biarcool- thx-to-phan1978
KJELD: Clutch, you can't go after the power crystals by yourself
It's too dangerous.
We, re sending reinforcements.
No thanks, Kjeld.
I work alone.
Glad nobody saw that.
Power crystals.
Whoa!
That's big enough to power LEGO City for a whole year.
Whoa.
Rock Monsters.
Why does it have to be Rock Monsters?
Oh, no.
The Mine Mech.
(NERVOUSLY) Come on, come on.
Whoa.
Time to get creative. Hmm.
Okay. Oh?
Uh-oh.
Perfect.
Uh-oh.
A baby?
Oh, no. This changes everything.
Shh. You'll be okay.
Good baby Rock Monster.
Is this your baby?
Looks just like you.
I'm sorry. l didn't know.
I just wanted one of your crystals.
Thisis Air 7 with a Clutch Powers sighting.
Hey, Clutch, thanks for helping us catch the crook.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Hey, look, it's Clutch Powers.
BOY 2: Hey, Clutch.
BOY 3: Looking good, Clutch.
Hey, Clutch Powers, can we go with you?
We're on our way to a four-alarm fire.
Come on!
Clutch Powers.
Watch out, Clutch!
Watch out!
Clutch Powers.
What's going on, Clutch?
Hey, Clutch.
Clutch, over here.
Welcome to LEGO headquarters.
You'll make great explorers one day.
Clutch.
Kjeld. l got the crystal.
You're late.
You're welcome.
I came as soon as
I got your signal.
Mmm-hmm.
The others made it on time.
What others?
Brick Masterson. Firefighter.
Weapons specialist. Demolitions expert.
S'up?
G'day.
Peg Mooring.
Biologist.
Single-handedly discovered 12 new species of marine life.
Thirteen, actually.
Ever so pleased to meet you.
Yours, love?
Bernie Von Beam.
The LEGO team's most brilliant engineer.
Hallo.
Hi, everyone. l'm...
Well, you're
Clutch Powers, of course.
Possibly the greatest
LEGO explorer ever.
They know who you are, Clutch.
Everyone knows who you are.
What about me?
Does everyone know me?
So, that's your team.
Wow. Pretty impressive.
But I work alone.
As do l.
Yep. Alone.
I work well with others.
Why does he get to be team leader, anyway?
Because.
Because why?
Because he didn't blow up a whole city block on his last mission.
Okay. I'm just asking.
What's gotten into all of you?
Have you all lost sight of the LEGO mission?
Have you forgotten what this organization represents?
Well, it's about helping others.
Fighting the good fight.
Engineering better solutions.
Doing whatever it takes, wherever it takes us.
And how do we do all that?
We build on each other.
It's something l learned from your father.
Yeah, that sounds like him.
He always talked a good game.
I brought you here because we've got a problem on Planet X-4.
The prison planet?
The Space Police lnterstellar Supermax
Correctional Facility, to be more specific.
It holds just three prisoners, the three most vicious criminals in the entire galaxy.
Two days ago, we received a garbled distress call from the Watch Commander.
WATCH COMMANDER:
The prisoners are escaping.
We need help.
KJELD: Then we lost communication with them entirely.
WATCH COMMANDER: Hurry.
What happened?
Prison break?
That's what l need you to find out.
Come on. We have a spaceship ready for you.
Oh. Hey, hey! Hey!
Yes, Brick?
Do l get to blow something up?
It's possible.
I guess it depends on what we find.
It's a bit of a mystery.
Yuck!
I hate mysteries.
I like mysteries.
Clutch Powers?
The Clutch Powers?
And you are?
Your biggest fan.
"A. Fol"?
Arthur. My friends call me Artie.
You can, too.
Call me Artie.
Or be my friend.
Right, Artie, like the great Clutch Powers would ever be friends with somebody like you.
Artie?
He knows my name.
There's no need to bow.
Of course. Of course.
You only bow to royalty, and you're not a king.
More like a god.
Arthur.
Artie.
Kjeld says you have a ship ready for us.
Oh, my golly goodness.
It's gotta be here somewhere.
I know l put it in...
Yes, the other pile.
Yes. No? Right!
This pile is the pile it was in.
I know I've got it.
Just came off the assembly line.
It's a Space Police
Lighthouse Massive Cruiser with modified crew quarters,
X-over-M thrusters and an ion-burst relativity jump drive for intergalactic travel.
And it's got a spinner.
Any questions?
Yeah, how are we all supposed to fit in this little thing?
BRICK: (CHUCKLES) Wow!
Well, why didn't you say so?
You're bringing extra hair?
A girl's gotta be prepared.
Whatever. Back up.
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?
Never send a girl to do a man's job.
Here. Let me give you a hand.
Yes!
MALEVOICE:
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four...
Seat belts, everyone?
... three, two...
Brick?
Seat belts?
We don't need no stinking...
... one, zero. Blast off!
...seat belts!
ALIENVOICE: Pizza delivery.
What idiot ordered pizza on the way to a mission?
BRICK: Where's my pizza?
Are we there yet?
How much longer?
Can't this thing go any faster?
I'll have you know we're going 1 .6 million kilometers per hour.
Actually, 1 .64 if you factor in the gravity slingshot effect.
You know, I'm quite the diarist myself.
I... What?
Isn't that your journal?
What journal?
The one you're sitting on.
Oh, that journal.
It's not mine.
It's my father's.
Your father?
Powers. Of course.
You're the son of Rock Powers, the legendary explorer.
I found this symbol in his notes.
It's just like the symbol from the prison distress call.
What did he make of it?
He didn't. lt was his last entry before he up and disappeared.
He was always missing.
Off on some crazy adventure or expedition.
But, hey, at least it taught me to fend for myself.
Yet here you are, still looking to him for guidance.
He was the best.
He never needed anybody or to be a part of a team.
BRICK: Practicing your secret handshake?
No, no, no, it's just... We were...
It's none of my business. l thought you should know.
We're there.
Ready for final approach.
You'll take it nice and easy, ja? l get motion sick.
Nice and easy.
Have you done this before?
It's like driving a fire truck, in space.
PEG: Didn't you crash that fire truck?
Whoa!
Slow down.
You're crazy!
Give me the controls.
Relax, I got it.
CLUTCH: You killed the engines.
BRICK: Oops!
Let go of the wheel.
This is why I work alone.
There you go, nice and easy.
Maybe l should guard the spaceship.
Let's go.
BRICK: This is the first time anyone had to break into a prison.
Okay. The air is good.
Smells like old gym socks.
Shh.
Well, it does.
Oh! And garlic, wow.
Oh, and a burrito platter.
That was tasty.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.
Keep an eye out behind us.
PEG: We should have left old stinky in the spaceship.
BERNIE: Nobody told me there was a burrito platter.
CLUTCH: Guys, come on.
It's empty.
The coast is clear.
Brick, watch our backs.
Keep an eye out for the Watch Commander.
Something bad happened here.
Brilliant deduction.
(THUDDING) Aah!
Help! Let me out of here!
What is that thing?
Let me out of here!
I got this one.
Put that thing down, you fool. Clutch.
Get her off of me.
What are you doing?
My job.
CLUTCH: l told you to stay back.
BRICK: Says you.
Hello?
This is my call.
Says you.
Come on.
Over here.
Please acknowledge me!
ALL: What?
Take cover.
Give me that.
PEG: It's the
Watch Commander.
I thought you'd never get here.
Come on, they're getting away.
You know, by the book.
So, there's absolutely no way they can escape from this planet.
It's just a matter of time before we capture them.
BERNIE: That sounds like our spaceship.
Who left the spaceship unlocked?
Um, that would be me.
But Brick's the one who left the keys in the ignition.
Yeah, but l didn't leave the operator's manual on the dashboard.
I wanted to guard the spaceship.
What kind of rescue team are you supposed to be?
Thanks to your bickering and squabbling, the three most vicious criminals in the galaxy are on the loose.
Do you have any idea what a disaster this is?
By now, they're already in hiding, plotting their next move and stuff.
Which is?
To unite all the forces of evil in the entire known universe.
Duh!
Would this be the right time to say we're sorry?
How are we gonna get back now?
CLUTCH: Guys, let's focus.
It's time to get creative.
Brick, you're on engines.
Bernie, flight control.
Peg, landing gear.
How am l gonna build a team out of a bunch of strangers?
It's not like we chose each other.
You can say that again.
Who does he think he is bossing me around, just because he's the boss and I'm around?
What are you doing?
You're making a mess.
I'll take that, thank you.
Who put that there?
Hey, watch it!
Pull it this way.
No, it doesn't.
No, you're wrong.
No, it goes like this.
Come on, it's just rocket science.
Can't get anyone to do anything around here.
What a mess this is.
These guys don't know what they're doing.
There. All done.
This is why I work alone.
If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.
There. All done.
Now that's how you build a spaceship.
Would somebody pleaseexplain to me whatjust happened?
Well, we built a new ship out of spare parts.
It was really quite ingenious. First...
At. The. Prison.
What happened at the prison?
Uh, can l take this one? l just want to say, this is all her fault!
My fault?
You were supposed to be watching our backs.
Can't hear you.
La-la-la-la-la.
Stop it. This is my fault and mine alone.
I was in charge of this mission.
So, if you want to blame anyone, blame me.
I allowed myself to be distracted from the mission.
By what?
I found a clue about what happened to my father.
Yourfather?
My father vanished three years ago on a top-secret expedition.
After all this time.
We thought his creation spark had been extinguished.
But then l saw this symbol on one of the prison cells.
What does it mean?
Omega.
It's the name of one of the three prisoners who escaped.
Kjeld, we've gotta go after him.
We don't know where he is.
But we've got a lock on the wizard who led the escape, and the situation is urgent.
He's putting an entire planet in jeopardy.
I'm sorry, Clutch.
Omega will have to wait.
Then let's get to work.
Say hello to prisoner number one,
MallockThe Malign, the EvilWizard of Ashlar.
Hello.
What's Ashlar?
A medieval world forgedfrom might and magic.
Mallock once ruled
Ashlar with an ironfist.
The only thing that could defeat him was the golden sword of the rightful king, the great King Revet.
He vanquished the dark wizard, but he paid the ultimate price.
His creation spark was extinguished.
Now Mallock has returned to Ashlar and reunited with his Skeleton Army to continue his quest for evil dominion.
Our only hopeis that the skill and courage of the great king have passed to his son,
Prince Varen.
Why doesn't the Prince fight back?
Heis young and untrained and something of a disappointment.
He needs someone to show him the way.
Is there a problem, Bernie?
(GROANS) Got it!
So, what's the mission?
Your missionis tofly to Ashlar, find PrinceVaren, and help him recapture the evil wizard Mallock.
Preparing to engage ion-burst relativity jump drive.
BERNIE: Be gentle.
Look! It's LEGO Hindge, the oldest and most mysterious minifig-made structure in all the universe.
No one knows what it was built for.
Oh! They're still studying it to this very day.
PEG: You're going too fast.
BRICK: No problemo.
I've always wanted to see it.
It's so incredible, ja?
You try and parallel park this thing.
What... Wait...
VILLAGER: Help us!
It's the dark magic.
None of our high-tech weapons will work.
Oh, no fair.
He must have cast a spell on this place.
He? He who?
He, him.
Holy hovercraft!
If l were wearing boots, l'd be shaking in them.
Let's go find Prince Varen.
I got a bad feeling about this.
I am getting so tired of your constant negativity.
Well, I'm not the one who lost the castle.
I didn't lose it.
It's just missing.
VILLAGER 1 : Somebody help us! Please!
Where is the Prince?
VILLAGERS: Have mercy.
Lock them away until they tell us where to find the Prince.
VILLAGER 1 : Please, let us go.
See, l think he's happy.
You two!
I am not happy.
Did you find the Prince?
I'll ask you once more and once more only.
Where is the Prince?
Well, not to tell you how to do your job, but a better question might be,
"Where is the castle?"
Good idea.
We know that one.
Well? Where is it?
It's missing.
Vanished.
Disappeared without a trace.
Gone with the wind.
Hogar.
And the Prince?
Well, we couldn't find him.
See, we went looking for him at the castle, but the castle was missing.
Course you already know that.
And then we were attacked by a bunch of knights.
A knight, actually.
There was only one.
But he was very effective.
Unpleasant.
Mean, l'd have to say.
Mean? Would you go that far?
Yeah. When he did the thing with the thing...
Right, right. Mean.
I'm good with mean.
This knight had a voice like thunder.
A sword as fast as lightning.
He came at us like a whirlwind.
All in all, we'd have to say...
BOTH: lt was a dark and stormy knight.
Find me the Prince, or else!
Nothing here but a bunch of junk.
We've got everything we need for a battle cart.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
LEGO!
Hey! Save your fight for Mallock.
Apologies, all.
You're right.
Good. It's time we start acting like a team.
Bernie, you're in charge of the build.
Just make it strong.
Strong. My neck.
And we're gonna need weapons.
Over here.
Over here. Pick me.
Pick me, me, me.
Brick, would like to be in charge of weapons?
Uh, what else you got?
Sure, no problem.
You want me to do weapons, I'll do weapons.
Peg, you see these tracks?
You spotted them, too?
Something with wings, l think.
A griffin perhaps.
Find out what it is and whose side they're on.
All right, team.
You've got your assignments.
I'll be back soon.
Where are you going?
To find Prince Varen.
MALLOCK: What do you think you're doing?
I told you to bring me a minifig.
This is a real fig.
Find me the Prince, now!
This whole place is going to pieces.
Hmm.
(CHUCKLES) Skelly! Bones!
Where are those ninnies?
Hey, look at this.
What are you doing?
Follow him!
And he'll lead us right to the Prince.
I don't get it.
Ah!
Alley-oop.
Sneaking, hiding, sneaking, hiding...
(CHUCKLES) We got him.
Hello, are we still hiding? Look what l found.
What are you doing?
Same thing as you.
Oh! Don't forget...
I'll just put this on here.
And right on here.
Give me that.
That's not funny.
Perfect.
Get down!
What part of hiding don't you understand?
Mmm.
Okay.
It's adorable.
I gotta touch it.
What are you doing, man?
No! Don't do that.
You're beautiful.
I'm so in love with you.
We could get married and build a house and build some kids.
None shall pass.
What are you doing in my forest?
My name is Clutch Powers.
I must find Prince Varen, the rightful heir to the throne of Ashlar.
Nobody crosses this bridge unless they pass three tests.
If you succeed, l will take you to Prince Varen.
And if l fail?
Then, l will eat you.
Bring it on.
You say you're
Clutch Powers, then prove it.
The real Clutch Powers would know how to build his own...bridge.
Next?
Using nothing but standard eight-stud bricks, how many bricks would it take to build a spiral staircase as tall as three minifigs?
There are more than 91 5 million ways to combine standard LEGO bricks.
But they will never connect on the diagonal.
So, it's a trick question.
It can't be done.
Not so fast.
For your final test, you must answer a riddle.
A riddle?
Yes, a riddle.
Trolls ask riddles.
It's what we do.
Fine. Ask away.
You hold my hand, though we cannot touch.
You hear my voice, though I do not speak.
You see my face, though I am not here.
Who am l?
You hold my hand, you hear my voice, you see...
You see my face.
The answer is my father.
Oh! You're good.
Now answer me.
Where can l find Prince Varen?
Yes, do tell.
We're dying to know.
Hand him over.
Mallock's orders.
This is not the man you are looking for.
Yeah, it is.
Darn! That never works for me.
Well, hate to eat and run, but...
SKELLY: Man, that hurts.
I hate when this happens.
Come on.
Let's get him.
Hey, where'd he go?
There he is, over there.
SKELLY: I can see where he is, man.
BONES: Okay, wait, can you remind me?
SKELLY: He went this way.
Which way?
SKELLY: Wait, it might have been that way.
BONES: Okay.
SKELLY: No, this way.
Let's go.
BONES: We got him now.
Okay. All right.
SKELLY: He's right there.
This way, this way. l thought there was a thing over here...
Wait, wait.
Where did he go?
Great. First you lose the castle, now this.
I didn't lose the castle.
You lost the castle.
Oh, no, you lost the castle.
No, you lost the castle.
You lost the castle.
No backs.
No fair.
Besides, we didn't lose it.
We just can't find it.
SKELLY: Yeah, yeah, and it's not that we weren't looking,
'cause we were always looking, it just wasn't around.
BONES: Exactly.
We just play stupid.
You think we can do that?
SKELLY: Well, you know,
I think you're probably
CLUTCH: Hey!
Let me out of here.
Did everyone have the burrito platter?
(BURPS) With extra garlic.
Now let's go.
Not so fast.
Who are you?
I am Hogar The Troll.
And you can take me to Prince Varen?
Open the gates.
Whoa!
Shall we?
Yeah, where do you want these doohickeys?
Those are called
Rack Winder Axles.
Stack them over there.
In a neat pile.
Technically, there's no such thing as a neat pile.
How about these whatchamacallits?
That's a 40-tooth spur gear.
Yeah, I'll put them over here with these other gizmos.
You need anymore of these thingies here?
Those are called "hinge rods."
Not "thingies" or
"doohickeys" or
"whatchamacallits." Okay?
Can l have one of those thingies?
It's not a...
Would you like a blue thingy or a red thingy?
(SIGHS) Brilliant.
Well, I'm off.
Cheers, all.
Good luck with your thingy.
Hey, I got that jazzamabob unstuck.
Oh, you poor dear.
That's a nasty cold, isn't it?
I built that wall to keep us hidden from
Mallock's prying eyes.
You built it?
But you're a...
I mean, aren't you a...
I mean, why?
Why is a disgusting, horrible, nasty-looking troll fighting for the good guys?
I wouldn't say disgusting.
I fight for the memory of King Revet because King Revet fought for me.
Despite my outward appearance, he saw that we were the same on the inside.
He took me in and embraced me.
He trusted me.
I will do everything in my power to keep this kingdom from falling to the forces of darkness.
But what does Mallock want?
This.
This is no ordinary sword.
In the hands of the rightful king, it has power over the mightiest evil.
Alas, we have no king.
If this sword falls into Mallock's hands, his villainy will be unstoppable.
But what about Prince Varen?
I do what l can to protect him, just as his father once protected me.
But he's young and inexperienced.
But...
There is no but.
His heart is in it, but l fear the rest of him isn't up to the challenge.
I can work with heart.
Where is he?
Clutch Powers, meet Prince Varen.
I got distracted, that's all.
Happens to the best of us.
Happens to me all the time.
I can show you what you're doing wrong.
It's pretty simple.
I doubt it.
I'm no good with a sword.
No, it's a broadsword, not an épée.
Hold it high above your head and swing from the shoulder. l told you I'm no good with a sword.
Who said you could bring strangers in here anyway?
Mallock's army of skeletons is amassing even as we speak.
We have to move now.
Not until I'm ready.
I'm here to help you defeat the evil wizard.
Trust me. I can help.
Like you helped me just now?
I don't need you.
I've got an army.
But do you know how to use it?
A sword is only as good as the knight who wields it.
I don't need your help.
Oh! What is wrong with him?
Why won't he listen to me?
Remember, he's not here for you.
You have to be here for him.
Hmm.
Wait! Where are you going?
Are we ready yet?
There. All done.
Sweet meteors, it's about time.
Everything is properly organized and sorted by function.
First, we arrange the parts in ascending order of size. Then...
Done. What do you think?
Well, extraordinary.
Except for this piece, which was in the instruction manual you didn't follow.
Nah!
But I'm sure it's not important.
I'll just hold on to it for safekeeping.
Just in case.
Hey, now you've got extra hair, just like Peg.
Me, like Peg?
And l quite like you, too, Bernie.
No, that's not what I said.
I mean, it is what I said, but it's not what I meant.
I didn't mean I like you.
I do like you, but what l was trying to say was...
Jumping jellybeans!
What happened to you?
It's just a little flesh wound.
And while I was gone, l see you were all playing dress up.
Everything went perfectly according to plan.
No surprises here.
Oh! Are you okay?
Oh, l'm...
You poor dear.
Don't mind me.
It's just my head.
I'll give you a pain in the head! Coming here to steal me gold for that evil wizard.
We thought this mine was abandoned.
Abandoned? She's beautiful, she is.
I'll give you abandoned, you little...
Who are you calling little?
Wait! You don't understand.
We're not here to help the evil wizard.
We're here to defeat him.
My heroes!
Lofar, at your service.
Good. We'll need all the help we can get.
Clutch, you're back.
Did you find the Prince?
Yup.
And?
We'll have to defeat
Mallock on our own.
We can do this.
He may have a thousand-strong army of skeleton warriors, but we've got...
Backbone?
Pluck?
Guts?
Me lucky socks.
Each other.
Peg, Bernie,
Lofar, you create a diversion out front while we drop behind the tower.
Once we're inside, load the cannons and let her rip.
Okay. Everyone know their assignment?
VAREN: l don't.
I've decided to allow you to help me.
And I've brought a few friends.
CLUTCH: The knights will attack the front with the others while l join Prince Varen in the back to face off with Mallock.
But it's my duty to lead the royal knights into battle.
But we need you inside to go after Mallock.
You can't be in two place at once.
Who says?
Your hair.
Give us your hair.
What's going on?
You're Prince Varen now.
Get up there and lead your knights into battle.
I look like a girl.
But a very pretty girl.
Prince Varen?
Mallock The...
Mallock The Malign, it is l, Prince Varen, rightful heir to the throne of Ashlar.
Come out with your hands up.
I can't believe l have to wear girl hair.
Shh.
(SOFTLY) Well, it's stupid.
No, come on. Come on.
Well done, lads.
Well done.
The last person who made it past my enchanted armor was your father.
Leave him alone, Mallock.
Can't you fend for yourself, boy?
After all, you are the king.
I said, leave him alone.
Too bad there's no one to save you now.
I'm warning you for the last time.
ROCK: Clutch?
Is that you? Clutch?
Dad?
He's right here.
Clutch! No!
Don't look at the crystal ball!
Dad! Dad, is that you?
VAREN: Clutch, don't look at the crystal ball.
It's a trick.
Clutch! Clutch!
What?
No!
Skeleton warriors, army of the night, l summon you!
Arise and attack!
These guys look bad to the bone.
Attack! Run them down and run them through.
Charge!
SOLDIERS: Yeah!
Take that!
SKELLY: Oh, yeah!
Hey, isn't that
Uncle Morty?
Hey, Morty!
Oh, Morty!
Get your head in the game.
He should've boned up on his fighting skills.
How about this one?
He always was a bonehead.
You out?
Bone dry.
LOFAR: Retreat!
Slow down!
Speed up! Speed up!
Turn around.
(SIGHS) l told you.
I'm no good with a sword.
This was my fault, not yours.
Why did he let us live?
He wants to display us like trophies.
Break his enemy's spirit.
Show them their worst fear.
What do you think you're doing?
I was driving.
You call that driving?
It's not her fault we crashed.
The wheels came loose because you left out a part.
If we stuck to your plan, we'd still be building it.
Well, at least it would be done right. Dummkopf
At least we got away.
That makes you happy, running away?
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Well, we know we can trust you to wreck everything.
Peg, may l speak to...
What is it, Bernie?
Oh?
Yes. Well, thank you.
Peg, l have something
I've been meaning to tell you. l love you. l just...
Bernie, look!
Bring me the golden sword of King Revet, or this is the last time you'll ever see them.
Hogar. Hogar!
Where are you going?
I must do as Mallock demands.
No! l must. l have no choice.
Yes, you do.
Don't give it to him.
I promised his father
I would protect his son.
I gave my word no harm would come to Prince Varen.
I'm sorry.
You'll pay for this trick, Hogar.
Wait, wait, where's the sword?
I dropped it.
What?
I couldn't even get it out of my scabbard.
I guess it's still in the hall, by the armor.
That means he doesn't know where it is.
We're going to get out of here, and I'm going to get you that sword before Mallock finds it.
How? There's nothing but a bunch of bones.
What are you doing?
If you wanna send a message, nothing beats hand delivery.
Brick, can you show me how to load the weapons?
What are you talking about?
They're shattered.
Then I'll help you rebuild them.
What's gotten into you?
Look!
BRICK: "LEGO."
Don't you see what he's trying to tell us?
Uh-uh.
We build on each other.
Give me five minutes,
I'll give you an arsenal.
That's the spirit.
Bernie, can you fix this rust bucket?
There's no way.
The frame is shattered, two wheels are gone, and we're missing half the parts.
I can't do it!
I tell you, I can't!
Okay. I'll do it.
Lock and load.
We're going in.
Huh?
Huzzah!
Tally-ho!
Thanks for letting me drive.
How's it handle?
Like a three-legged hippo.
I did the best with what l had.
It's an engineering marvel, Bernie.
I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but I do have one teensy question.
How exactly are we gonna get to Clutch?
Good boy!
You do have a way with animals.
Hey, Clutch!
Skelly? Bones?
Where are those nincompoops?
Snake eyes!
Roll them bones.
Here we go.
That's right, put it down.
Roll them high.
Come on, baby.
Good stuff.
Good stuff.
Load me up, Bernie.
I'm going in.
What? Wait a minute.
Whoa! Mommy!
Seven, again!
This is my lucky day.
Don't be jealous.
The wheel's jammed.
It won't turn.
We have to jump.
On three.
One, two...
I can't. I'm stuck.
Jump! What are you waiting for?
Hold me tight. l will go get your legs.
Oh! I'm not half the man l used to be.
Hurrah!
This sword, in your hands, gives you the power over the greatest evil.
But I'm no good with a sword.
You saw.
No. I'll tell you what I saw.
I saw a brave warrior tackle an enchanted knight with nothing but bare hands and courage.
I don't know.
I can't do it.
Yes, you can.
No! My father had this power, but l'm not my father.
He's always with you.
His strength lives in you.
MALLOCK: This is the end,
Prince Varen.
I'm going to snuff your creation spark just like l took your father's.
All your friends will be defeated and this kingdom will be mine, forever.
Huh?
BRICK: Take this, take that...
Back off!
Here's a little bit more for you to take. l told you it might come in handy.
No! You'll never take my kingdom.
Give me the sword,
Clutch Powers.
Give me the sword, and l will take you to your father.
You can see him again.
Just give me the sword.
No, Clutch.
Give me the sword.
I can take you to him.
Give me the sword, or you'll never see your father again.
He's alive?
Clutch, he's right here.
He's always with you.
I already found him.
Don't worry, this is my battle.
Hey, Mallock, over here!
Get him. Yeah!
That's the spirit.
You can do it.
Come on, Varen! Yeah.
This is the end, Prince Varen.
That's King Varen.
And you're under arrest.
Yeah! We did it!
Long live the King!
ALL: Long live King Varen!
Oh, my hip is killing me.
Hey, nice toss back there, gear-head.
You weren't so bad yourself.
Sorry.
Just kidding.
Thanks, Bernie.
But I think it looks better on you.
Clutch, I know what you gave up back there.
And I know it wasn't easy.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
I'll find my dad someday.
For now, it's enough to know he's alive.
Great work, Clutch.
Uh, don't thank me.
Thank the team.
Tens and 20s would be fine.
Oh?
We've located your next target, on the other side of the galaxy.
I think you know what this means.
I'm driving!
I call shotgun.
Here we go again.
Preparing to engage ion-burst relativity jump drive.
You poor little fella.
It's all right.
Big Mama's here.
You know, you're gonna need some caring for.
Now... Now, let's see, darlin'.
You need, um...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not me. Not Big Mama, now.
Now I'm thinkin', though.
Mm-hmm. Oh, uh-huh.
Now... Now don't...
Don't you move, honey.
Big Mama's gonna be right back.
Good work, Boomer.
We'll get him this time.
Shh! I think he's in there.
Whew!
Am I glad I found you boys.
There's no time to lose.
I need your help. Now come on.
- Come on.
- Let's go, Boomer. Come on.
Yeah, but... Oh, shucks.
Oh, poor little guy.
Don't you worry now. We're going to find someone to look after you.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hey, I think I got an idea.
OK, Boomer, now you know what to do.
Yeah, leave it to me.
Leave it to me.
Who is it?
Well, I was sure I heard someone knocking.
Oh, dear! My laundry!
Oh, here! Stop it!
Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?
Oh, stop!
Well, I wonder what got into those birds.
Well, bless my soul!
Why, it's...
It's a baby fox.
Oh.
Hello, little fella.
I wonder where its mother is.
Come on, now. I'm not going to harm you.
Now, now. Oh, isn't that...?
Oh, my, my. You're a feisty little rascal, aren't you?
There, there, now. Calm down.
No, I just can't leave you out here all alone.
Oh, isn't he darling?
Now, not so fast.
Now, now, not so fast.
Oh, my. You're such a little toddler.
Say, that's what I'm going to call you.
Tod.
You know, Tod,
I'm not going to be so lonesome anymore.
I got a surprise for you, Chief, old boy.
Now, now, now, take it easy.
Well, how's this for a huntin' dog?
He's just a little runt now, but he'll grow.
You may as well get used to him, Chief.
He's for you to look after from now on.
Tod, stop pestering Abigail.
Abigail, you're going to have to be patient with Tod.
He's one of the family now.
Oh, of course. Now I know.
I declare, I never will get my chores done.
Oh, mercy!
Tod! Tod, stop it!
Abigail! Abigail!
Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no!
Easy, easy, Abigail.
Steady, old girl. Steady.
There, there.
Tod, you come here.
I said come here!
Just look what you've done.
Now, don't try to butter me up.
Oh, Tod, I just can't stay angry with you.
You little imp. Now run along and play.
Go on.
And try to stay out of mischief.
Hey, it's Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.
Is this it, Boomer?
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.
I never forget a tree.
I never forget a tree.
He won't get away this time.
Hold it, Boomer. I think
I hear somethin'.
That's him, all right, Dinky.
That's him, all right.
Shh, shh. Get ready, Boomer.
Hey, I can hear him movin'. Listen.
That's funny. I don't hear nothin'.
Shh! Quiet.
Oh, that's him, Dinky.
That's him, all right.
Button your beak, will ya?
I'll check it out.
Would you look at that?
OK, Boomer, he's right... there.
Yikes! Watch it!
Why, you...
Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!
Hiya, fellas.
What ya doin'? Wanna play?
Stay outta this, kid.
This don't concern you.
Let him have it!
Don't let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!
Aaah!
- Which way did he go?
- This way.
There he is!
What happened to ya? Golly!
Oh, shucks! I think
I bent my b-b-beak.
Now see what you done?
You cost us our breakfast.
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.
- What are you talkin', my fault?
- Yeah, yeah.
A worm? For breakfast?
Yuck! Blecch!
Hey, there, Copper, what ya sniff in' at?
Somethin'... I never smelled... before, Chief.
Huh. Let me see.
Ah, shucks, that's easy.
The master's just cookin' grits and fatback. You oughta know that.
Mm-mmm.
That's not what I smell.
I don't know, Chief.
It's something else.
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin' to do about a-sniffin' and a-smellin'.
Hey, where you goin'?
I want to find out what that smell is.
OK, Copper, but the master ain't gonna like you wanderin' off.
I won't get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.
Can't tell these young whippersnappers anything.
What ya smellin'?
I'm on the trail of somethin'.
Trail of what?
I don't know yet.
Why, it's... it's you!
What do you do that for?
We're supposed to do that when we find what we've been trackin'.
I'm a fox.
My name's Tod. What's your name, kid?
Mine's Copper. I'm a hound dog.
Gee, I bet you'd be good playin' hide-and-seek.
Wanna try it, Copper?
Can I use my nose?
Sure. OK.
Now go ahead and close your eyes and count.
One, two, three...
No, Copper! You can't peek!
- Oh.
- Now start again.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
My, my. Look at that.
A fox and a hound, playin' together.
When you're the best of friends
Having so much fun together
You're not even aware you're such a funny pair
You're the best of friends
Life's a happy game
You could clown around forever
Neither one of you sees your natural boundaries
Life's one happy game
Copper!
Gee, I've gotta go.
If only the world wouldn't get in the way
If only people would just let you play
They say you're both being fools
You're breaking all the rules
They can't understand
The magic of your wonderland
When you're the best of friends
Copper!
Sharing all that you discover
When these moments have passed
Will that friendship last?
Who can say?
There's a way
Oh, I hope
I hope it never ends
Come on, Copper!
'Cause you're the best of friends
Copper, you're my very best friend.
And you're mine too, Tod.
And we'll always be friends forever, won't we?
Yeah, forever.
Hey, let's go swimmin'!
Give me a head start and I can beat ya!
Whoo!
Dagnabit! That Copper pup's gone and strayed off again.
Come on, Chief.
If that little rascal's gonna make me a good huntin' dog, he's gotta learn to mind.
Copper! Get over here!
Copper!
Uh-oh. I gotta go home.
Do ya have to? We're havin' too much fun.
I gotta. He sounds awful mad.
I'll see ya tomorrow!
- And don't forget!
- I won't!
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?
Why didn't you...?
Golly! You're all tied up.
Yeah, and it's no fun either.
The master says I gotta stay home.
Well, we can play around here then.
Oh, no. Not with old
Chief over there.
Is that him making that awful noise?
He keeps me awake at night.
Oh, don't go in there!
He can get awful mean!
He's cranky.
Gee-whillikers, is he ever big.
His ears isn't as big as yours, Copper.
That's not the part you gotta worry about.
Wow! Look at those teeth.
That's the part you gotta worry about!
I'm gainin' on him.
- He won't get away now.
- He's wakin' up!
Get out, Tod!
No. He's havin' a dream.
He's chasin' somethin'.
When I get him cornered...
It's... It's... It's a big old badger.
Copper, he's chasin' a badger.
No, no, it ain't a badger.
It's a... It's a f...
It's a fox. A fox?
Run, Tod! Run!
Tod!
Amos Slade, you trigger-happy lunatic!
Give me that gun!
My radiator!
Why, you blasted female.
- I'll... I'll...
- Hold it right there!
Watch it! That thing's loaded!
Now it ain't loaded!
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin' fox was after my chickens!
Rubbish and poppycock!
I don't believe it. He wouldn't hurt a thing.
You callin' me a liar, you muddleheaded female?
- I saw it happen!
- Amos Slade, that temper of yours is going to get you into a lot of trouble.
Temper?
Temper, woman? You ain't seen my temper!
If I ever catch that fox on my property again, I'll blast him!
And next time, I won't miss!
Poor little tyke.
It's a shame I have to keep him cooped up.
Tod, stop looking at me like that.
It's not my fault, you know.
You caused a lot of trouble yesterday.
Oh, now what are they up to?
Why, it looks like Amos is going on a hunting trip.
A long one, from the looks of it.
Hmm. Well, good riddance!
Doggone meddlin' female, shootin' up my radiator!
Dad blame it. Get goin'!
There. Well, that's more like it.
Keep runnin', old girl.
Well, Copper, me and old Chief are gonna teach you all about huntin'.
Yes, sir. It's about time too.
Attaboy.
Yeah, you're gonna like trackin' down those varmints for me.
Uh-uh. Get in the back, half-pint.
You gotta earn your right to sit up front.
Well, boys, we're gettin' outta here till next spring.
Tod, honey, what are you doin' over here?
Gee, I just wanted to say goodbye to Copper, but I'm too late.
Well, what did you plan to do if you ran into old Chief?
Ah, Chief. I can outfox that dumb old dog anytime.
Tod, now hold it just one minute.
Didn't you learn anything yesterday?
Now you listen good, Tod, because it's either education or elimination.
Now if you're so foxy and old Chief's so dumb, then why does that hound get the fox on the run?
'Cause he's got the hunter, and the hunter's got the gun. Ka-bam!
Elimination. Lack of education.
If you pal around with that Copper hound
You'll wind up hangin' on the wall
Keep your nose to the wind
You'll keep your skin
'Cause you won't be home when the hunter comes to call...
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper would never track me down.
Why, old Copper, he's my best friend.
Your best friend.
Now, Copper's gonna do what he's been told.
Supposed to chase the little old fox into the old foxhole, then along comes the hunter with a buckshot load.
- Ka-ka-ka-bam!
- Elimination.
Lack of education.
You better believe it, Tod.
Yes, sirree!
You mean Copper is gonna be my enemy?
Hey!
Kid, you better step over here and take a good look.
Why... Why, that's awful.
Those poor things.
I'm sorry, Tod.
Honey, Copper's gonna come back a trained huntin' dog.
A real killer.
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.
He won't ever change.
I hope you're right, Tod.
And we'll keep on being friends forever.
Um, won't we, Big Mama?
Darlin', forever is a long, long time, and time has a way of changin' things.
Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.
- I'm freezin' my b...
- Hey!
It's that fuzzy worm!
Let's get him!
Charge!
Hey, Dinky! Dinky, quick! Over here!
I got him! I got him!
Do I look like a worm?
That's who we're after.
Come on!
Look at that little creep, warm and cozy by the fire.
Let me take a look.
Now how do you like that guy?
Snug as a bug, while we're out here freezin' our b-b-b-beaks off.
Well, yackin' and shiverin' ain't gettin' us anywhere.
We'll get that no-good worm when we come back.
Oh, sh-sh-sh-shucks.
So long, Big Mama.
Yeah, we're goin' s-s-south for the winter.
Goodbye, boys. See ya next spring.
Well, look who's here.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm sorry, Tod, honey.
- I hope...
- Hiya, Big Mama.
We're back. We flew all the way.
Yeah, we did. We did.
Welcome home, boys!
It's been kind of lonesome around here without you little rascals.
Hi, fellas!
Hey, who's that? Who's that?
This can't be that scrawny little squirt we found by the fence post, can it? Come on.
I... I can't believe my eyes.
Oh, it's me, all right.
Hey, looky there. He's got himself a real fancy collar.
Hey, hey, hey. Just look at this bushy tail.
Beautiful.
Aw, come on. Cut it out. You guys are always teasin' me.
Hey, it's him, it's him. Squeeks.
We'll see ya later, kid.
We gotta take care of some unfinished business.
I can't understand.
It was so healthy.
There. That oughta perk it up.
Now, where'd he go? Where'd he go?
He's goin' up the drainpipe!
I'll head him off.
OK, Boomer, we got him trapped! Let him have it!
Aah!
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.
Neither did I.
Come on! Look!
A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy!
- Holy!
- Smoke!
Hey, hey, how's he do that,
Dinky? How's he do that?
I ain't got no job
I'm a huntin' man
And I'd rather have a dog than a dollar
So let's go banjo ring-a-ling-a-ding-ho
Give a little hoot and a holler
Aw, come on, Chief.
Just 'cause you're not sittin' up front, that ain't no reason to be a sorehead.
Shucks, if it weren't for you,
Copper'd never have turned into a good huntin' dog.
Yes, sirree.
Now I got me the best two dogs there is.
Right, Copper?
Isn't he somethin', Chief?
Look, Big Mama! Copper's back!
Boy, has he grown big.
Uh-huh.
And look at that big pile of skins he helped track down.
I know, Big Mama. He's a huntin' dog now.
You're right. And you're a fox.
Ah, that won't make any difference.
Copper's gonna be glad to see me.
Well, honey, just don't get your hopes too high.
Look, don't worry. I'll be careful.
I'll go tonight when Chief and the hunter are asleep.
Boy, it's great to be back home, isn't it, Chief?
Aw, come on, Chief. You aren't still sore, are ya?
Hey, hey, come on. Let's scuffle.
We ain't scuffled in a long time.
Come on, Chief!
Let's have some fun!
Oh, lay off, Copper, you overgrown pup, you.
Oh, let go!
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!
Oh, OK, OK.
That was your trouble on the hunt.
Aw, come on, old-timer.
You treat me like a pup, you know that?
Why, I think I done real good trackin' down them varmints for ya.
Smellin' and trackin' ain't enough.
You gotta think nasty.
OK, OK, I know.
I know.
Copper.
Hey, Copper.
It's me, Tod.
I thought that was you,
Tod. I heard ya comin'.
Boy, you've really grown.
You have too, Copper.
I saw you comin' back with
Chief and the hunter.
It's great to see ya, Tod.
But, you know, you...
You shouldn't be over here.
You're gonna get us both into a lot of trouble.
Hey, look, I... I just wanted to see ya.
We're... We're still friends, aren't we?
Tod, those days are over.
I'm... I'm a huntin' dog now.
You'd better get outta here before old Chief wakes up.
Oh, Chief. He doesn't worry me.
Tod, I'm serious. You're...
You're fair game as far as he's concerned.
It's that fox again!
Oh, no! No!
They're after Tod!
After him, boys! Go get him!
Copper!
Copper! Copper!
Tod, I...
I don't wanna see you get killed.
Track him down, boy!
I'll let you go this one time.
Don't lose him!
There they are! Old Chief's got him on the run!
Jump, Chief! Jump!
Chief!
Chief?
Oh, no!
No!
Tod, if it's the last thing I do, I'll...
I'll get you for this!
Tod!
Tod? Tod!
Oh, Tod!
Thank heaven you're safe.
Oh, poor Chief.
And it's all my fault.
I shouldn't have let Tod go.
Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up!
There's trouble!
Tod! Well, what is it?
What on earth?
Widow, get out here!
Why, Amos! What are you...?
Where is he? Where is he?
I know he's in there.
Now just a minute.
You can't come bargin' onto my property, Amos Slade!
That fox of yours almost killed Chief, and I'm gonna get him!
You can't keep him locked up forever!
We met, it seems
Such a short time ago
You looked at me
Needing me so
Yet from your sadness
Our happiness grew
And I found out I needed you too
I remember how we used to play
I recall those rainy days
The fire's glow
That kept us warm
And now I find
We're both alone
Goodbye may seem forever
Farewell is like the end
But in my heart's the memory
And there... you'll always be
Goodbye may seem forever
Farewell is like the end
But in my heart's the memory
And there you'll always be
Hold it, sonny! Back off!
Consarn it! Where...? Where do you think you're goin'?
Oh, oh, excuse me, I...
I was just trying to...
You barge in on somebody's house like you own it.
Tarryhootin' around them woods, wakin' up folks in the middle of the night.
I honestly didn't know anybody lived here, and I...
Well, you know it now.
Now get off my property!
Go on! Beat it!
I've been watching you, sir. You can stay with me if you want to.
- That's very nice of you.
- Come with me.
She dropped that fox off at the game preserve.
We'll get him. We'll get him.
Well, now, if you gotta have a busted leg, ah, this is the way to do it.
Good food, soft pillow, warm stove.
Sure beats sleepin' in that barrel.
Well, now, here comes visitors to see the invalid.
How do you like that? They didn't even ask how I'm feelin'.
Chief, get back in there before I break your other leg.
Copper, Copper, lookit here.
Now, when that fox comes traipsin' along, suspectin' nothin'...
Tod?
Tod?
Oh, boy. These old wings ain't what they used to be.
Big Mama, you better lose a few pounds.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, there he is, there he is.
Tod!
Tod!
Oh, hi, Big Mama.
Oh, it's you, Vixey.
Hey, what brings you way out here?
I'm lookin' for a fox named Tod.
- He's new here in the forest.
- Oh, new? Um...
Well, what does he look like?
Oh, he's young. About your age.
And handsome.
Handsome? Oh, say.
Gee, uh, he sure sounds nice.
Uh, I'm not doing anything.
I'll help you find him.
Come on. He's gotta be around here somewhere.
Wham?
What happened? Where am I?
So, it's you again, hmm?
You barged in on me last night, and now you...
I... I didn't mean to.
Just look at the... mess you made.
Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
Excuses, excuses.
Mr. Digger, sir? It was so too an accident.
You keep out of this, you walkin' pincushion.
You shouldn't be so grumpy to someone who's new in the neighborhood.
A stranger, eh?
Why don't you go back where you came from?
Wham?
Well, go on.
Get goin'. Git!
Aww.
Gosh, he seems so... I don't know, so downhearted, Big Mama.
Well, you can't blame him, honey.
He was dropped out here and left all alone without a friend in the world.
Well, maybe there's something I could do.
You know, cheer him up.
Honey, you just said the magic words.
Now...
What? But Big Mama, I don't...
Darlin', don't move.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Mornin', Tod.
Hello, Big Mama.
Last night was pretty miserable for you, wasn't it, honey?
Just terrible.
Cheer up and look around.
The forest is beautiful this morning.
After last night, nothin' looks beautiful.
Wow!
Who...? Who is that?
Oh, just another fox.
A lady fox.
Golly!
Is she beautiful!
I wonder what her name is.
Well, why don't you go ask her?
Yeah. Yeah, guess... Guess I will.
I'll... I'll go up to her and I'll say, "You're the most gorgeous...
The most beautiful...
Never seen anyone, anywhere..." I'll say...
Hi.
Hello.
- Big Mama told me, you know...
- I just happened to be...
May I call you by your first name?
Oh. Sure. Why not?
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?
- Vixey.
- Vixey.
Uh-huh.
My name is... is... uh, Tod.
Tod?
That's a... That's a nice name, Tod.
It looks like that farm boy is makin' it b-b-big with her.
Shh! Now just keep it down.
Well, Tod, you know something?
This stream is just full of trout.
Do you think you could catch one?
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.
My dear young lady... you happen to be looking at an expert... fisher fox.
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don't overdo it.
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.
Please let him catch a fish.
Here comes a whopper!
Now, watch closely.
Tod, do you need help?
No. No, I... I do it this way all... all the... all the time!
I got him.
Oh, that farm boy, he don't know nothin' about f-f-fishin'.
He ain't gonna hook her that way.
Oh, gosh!
Tod, you're the funniest thing I ever saw!
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!
You're like everyone else around here.
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You are so funny.
So I can't fish!
You're a silly, empty-headed... female!
Now just a minute.
I mean, you've got a nerve.
Why don't you grow up?
Tod, that's no way to talk to Vixey.
Oh, raspberries! I've had it.
Honey, don't stay mad.
You gotta be natural. That's the trick. Can't you see?
When you have a natural attraction
You deserve a mutual reaction
You're gonna get a whole lot
Of satisfaction
Here's all you gotta do
When you feel that
Natural affection
Leads you in the positive direction
You gotta stop showin' off
Start showin' up
With little old natural you
Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady
And now that is a natural fact
'Cause when you be yourself
With the lady, yeah
You gonna get appreciated
Right back
Shh.
- But Big Mama...
- It's just getting interesting.
Tod, I...
I just know you're gonna love the forest.
Listen, come on. Let me show you around.
Sure.
Come on.
Look. One, two, three, four, five, six.
Seven.
I think six would be just right.
Six?
Six what?
"No hunting."
Well, now, we ain't gonna do none of that, are we, Copper?
We're just gonna get us a no-good fox.
All right, boy, get trackin'.
Smell him out.
What ya got there, Copper?
Good work, boy.
He'll be comin' right through here, headin' for water.
But he won't be drinkin' any.
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.
You know, I've never been happier.
Oh, Tod, me too.
That does it.
Amos, you crafty old coot.
The devil himself couldn't have done no better.
Tod?
- Tod, wait a minute.
- What is it, Vixey?
I don't wanna go in there. It's too quiet.
Oh, Vixey.
What?
Tod, be careful.
Dad blast it! He's gettin' away!
Quick, Vixey!
Go on, head for the burrow.
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.
Tod!
Oh, no, Tod.
Cooper! Copper!
We got 'em now for sure.
This is their only way out.
Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.
Tod!
We're trapped!
Tod, I'm scared.
Quick, Vixey! This is our only chance!
Whoa! No! I don't believe it!
Copper, we've trapped him now!
Ow!
Copper!
Tod!
Tod?
Come on, Copper. Get outta the way.
Well... come on, boy.
Let's go home.
Shh, Shh. This is it.
We got him for sure now.
Oh, my g-g-gosh!
- Whoa!
- Yoww!
What happened?
Hey, there's somethin' very familiar about those eyes, Dinky.
Nah, it couldn't be.
Could it?
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.
Good luck, honey.
Ouch! You're killin' me! Ouch!
Amos Slade, will you hold still?
You're behaving like a child.
Well, for gosh sakes, you're hurtin' my foot, woman!
- Nonsense! Your foot is mendin' fine.
- Ow!
You'll soon be yourself.
Oh, land sakes. I don't know if I like that.
Ow! Be careful! Ouch!
He's sure makin' a big fuss over a little old hurt leg.
Copper?
You're my very best friend.
And you're mine too, Tod.
And we'll always be friends forever, won't we?
Yeah, forever.

that's who
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard
We wrote the story
of the old brigades
We know the glory
of yesterday's parades
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard
- Halt!
- Carry on, sergeant.
Captain Greer, sir, from headquarters at Tidbury, here to check military preparations.
Tell them Pepperinge Eye has matters well in hand.
Nevertheless, l...
What on earth is that?
Good morning, General. l received your message, Mrs Hobday.
- l assume my parcel has arrived.
- lt's in the office.
How lovely.
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.
Her late father served with me.
What does she burn in this? lt smells like sulphur.
Ridiculous! One can't make motor fuel out of sulphur!
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.
- Thank you.
- ls it what you expected?
- l imagine so.
- He sent you a cat last time.
- Professor Browne is well?
- l haven't the faintest idea.
Are we to have the pleasure of meeting him? l doubt it. l don't know
Professor Browne personally.
- Was there something else?
- Yes. Would you come this way?
- l'm very anxious to get home.
- Come along, please.
- Get down, Charlie. l want a ride!
- Bash him one!
Stop it this instant!
Children, this is Miss Price.
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins, all the way from London.
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?
The government are trying to evacuate children into the country.
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.
And l've had to find homes for all of them at very short notice.
These are the last three. All right, children. Pick up your things.
You're not suggesting l take these children into my house?
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.
Children and l don't get on. l'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.
Be quiet.
Besides, l have important work to do.
Miss Price, you do have that entire house to yourself.
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice. l see. lf that is the case l shall take them into my house, with the understanding that you find another home as soon as possible.
Fine. Come along.
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable thing you are doing, taking in these poor unfortunates from the city.
- Hold this very carefully.
- l wonder if l may drop by later.
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.
My parcel, please.
Bring your things inside.
- Bit murky, ain't it?
- Yeah.
Not another house round here for miles.
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.
- Who else lives here?
- l live alone. lt suits my purpose.
All right. Come along, everybody.
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!
- What do you call your cat?
- l don't give animals silly names. l call him Cosmic Creepers because that's the name he came with.
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.
Be very careful of everything in it.
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.
- What was your name?
- Carrie, miss.
- You sleep in the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.
- ls that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down.
Travel light, that's us. l don't think this is going to work but it seems that l have no alternative.
We'll do our best, miss.
Really, we will.
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.
- Supper is at 6:00. You will wash...
- Wash?
You will wash yourselves otherwise there will be no supper. ls that clear?
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.
Please don't bother to whisper. l'm exceptionally keen of hearing.
You are planning to run back to London.
Please do your plotting elsewhere where l shan't have to listen to it. l don't know much about what children eat.
You'll have to make do as l do. ls there anything in particular that you fancy?
Sausage and mash, bubble and squeak, toad in the hole, fried fish...
Anything at all.
You won't find any fried foods in this house.
- No fried food?
- No.
How do you keep your health?
Cabbage buds, rosehips, hyssop seed, elm bark, wattle yeast and stewed nettles.
''Dear Madam. With this shipment, the Emelius Browne
College of Witchcraft sends you its congratulations on qualifying for the first degree of your chosen calling.''
''You may now call yourself
'apprentice witch'.''
''Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne.''
My first broom.
Time to go. Everybody up.
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.
Let's see how we fly this thing.
Here we are.
''Clasp the broom with both hands.''
Yes, of course.
''Never astride the broom.''
Oh, yes, of course.
''A witch is always a lady unless circumstances dictate otherwise.''
''Take an easy, graceful sideways position.''
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.
There we are. How's that?
''To start up the broom, your basic formula:
La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!'' l wasn't ready!
Now watch this.
Here we go. lt's going to be a little different this time.
All right. l know it's not ladylike.
What's the matter?
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.
That's the sort of thing witches do.
She don't fly good, do she?
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.
Look out!
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.
Hang on. l'm having a bit of a think.
A witch she is, says you.
Then let's use the old loaf, says l.
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.
She don't want anyone to know she's a witch, does she?
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.
And l intend to make the most of it. Come on.
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.
Very healthful, l'm sure!
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. lt's nothing serious.
Lovely weather for flying last night.
Why did you say that, Charles?
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are. l see.
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.
Thank you. l should be most grateful if you didn't tell anyone.
Course there would have to be one or two little changes made round here. l mean, l'd like to see an occasional sausage on the table here.
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.
There will be no more of this wash, wash, wash, morning and night.
Anything else?
Now you mention it, l could do with a bit of lolly.
Lolly?
Cash. Cold, hard cash.
You must have buckets of it.
The most accomplished of witches can't make money out of thin air.
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?
Be that as it may, you don't want us to blab, do you?
Have you considered what danger you might be in? l am a witch, you know.
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.
- l might just do that.
- Go on, then. l dare you.
Very well, Charles.
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.
She can't even ride a proper broom.
Excuse me, Charles.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Oh, Charlie!
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!
Bother! l never seem to be able to manage toads.
Stop! Leave him alone!
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long. l'm just an apprentice witch.
Look out, Charlie!
You flaming brute! l'll teach you to do that to me!
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault. l'm afraid it's my fault.
Bad enough not being able to manage a broom. l can't perform a simple, basic spell.
You dared her to do it. l don't see why we can't all be friends.
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.
Of course l'm not!
- See?
- lf only l could trust you.
You see, the work l'm doing is so important to the war effort.
- How do you mean?
- l mean exceptionally important.
Most secret.
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.
Yeah. lf someone made it worth our while. l don't follow.
Simple. You give us something valuable to seal the pact.
Oh, Charlie, don't try to be clever again. lt's for our own protection, ain't it? lf we broke the pact, we'd have to give back the valuable object. l think it's an excellent idea. l wonder what l could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?
Bet that's not worth much.
Come with me.
- l like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.
Well, l never had a rabbit.
Careful what you touch in here.
Rum sort of place, ain't it?
When l signed for my witchcraft course there was a free bonus, a marvellous travelling spell if you paid in advance. l think l'll give you that one.
- ls it valuable?
- Certainly.
Poisoned dragon's liver?
You mean you poison the dragon or just the liver? lt comes prepared. lt's part of the school equipment.
Here we are. The travelling spell.
Everybody gather round.
All right now. Let's see.
Does any one of you have a bracelet or a ring?
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.
Never know when they might come in useful. Piece of blue glass.
Lovely bit of string.
Horseshoe nail.
What's that?
Knob from the bed upstairs.
- lt twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.
Yes, l think that will be all right.
Carrie, turn the light down a little bit, will you?
Hellebore, henbane, aconite... glow-worm fire, firefly light!
There. lsn't that pretty? ls that all we get?
This knob will now work the famous travelling spell.
And what's the famous travelling spell?
- How does it work?
- You take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs.
Then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left then in a firm, clear voice, tell it where you want to go and the bed will take you there.
Go on!
- Will it really?
- l see no reason to think otherwise.
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the only one who can work the spell.
- Me?
- Yes.
That's right. My knob, weren't it?
That's the way the spell works.
Nice mess he'll make of things.
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.
Don't try anything with the bedknob till l get back.
''Dear Madam, it grieves me to inform you that we have been forced to close down our College of Witchcraft.''
''This means that we shall not be sending you the final lesson in which you expressed so much interest.''
- What's keeping you?
- l've had some very bad news. ls there anything we can do?
No. No, thank you.
Yes.
Yes, there is something that Paul can do.
- Me?
- l need the bedknob back.
- l must get to London.
- No. l want to go to the jungle.
Come with me, Paul.
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem to have to explain this to a six-year-old,
- l do need your help.
- Go ahead. l was expecting a very important spell in the mail from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.
What's that got to do with my knob? l must go to London immediately and see Professor Browne.
With his help, we may be able to bring this war to a successful end.
That is why l need the knob.
What is your decision?
Thank you, Paul. l brought this for your hair. lt may be windy.
Thank you. lt's ever so nice.
Paul, have you been to the bathroom?
- Twice.
- Good.
Charles, put on something warmer.
The bed may travel quite fast. l'm not going. l'm staying right here.
But why?
All that rubbish about a travelling bed. lt won't work. That's why.
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.
We don't want to scratch the wall when we take off.
How's a ruddy big bed like that gonna get out of this room with those little windows? l don't know. There's a great many things about magic that l don't know.
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!
Just leave me out of it. l don't fancy making a fool of myself.
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.
Help me tidy up. We don't want to go to London with an unmade bed.
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve. l see. That's what my father used to call the age of not believing.
What's that supposed to be?
When you rush around
in hopeless circles
Searching everywhere
for something true
You're at the age of not believing
When all the make-believe
is through
That's Charlie to a tee.
When you set aside
your childhood heroes
And your dreams are lost
upon a shelf
You're at the age of not believing
And worst of all you doubt yourself
Throw that away.
You're a castaway
where no one hears you
On a barren isle in a lonely sea
What's that? Poetry?
Where did all the happy endings go?
Where can all the good times be?
Everyone on the bed who's going.
You must face the age
of not believing
Doubting everything you ever knew
The knob.
Until at last you start believing
There's something wonderful in you
Lovely sentiment, l'm sure.
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.
Repeat after me.
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...
Very good.
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.
..of Witchcraft, London.
When l say go, tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left.
- Left...
- That's it.
We'd better hold on tight.
The behaviour of the bed is something l'm not sure of.
Let me breathe a little.
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.
One... two... three...
- ls this London?
- Course it is!
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet l ain't. l don't see no Professor Browne.
Neither do l.
You children look after the bed while l make enquiries for Mr Browne.
- l told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again. lt didn't work. lt was supposed to take us to Professor Browne.
- ''Professor Browne.''
- Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, gather round, please.
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne. l am here to divert, to amuse, and, yes, even to help you.
- There he is!
- lt is not what things are... lt is what they seem to be. ls that not so?
That ain't the kind of professor l expected. l'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.
What effect a little smoke is... with a dash of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning... and the scent of burning sulphur in the air.
And now, for my next trick, may l draw your attention to this solid piece of ordinary window glass, framed in an ordinary unprepared frame.
May l also draw your attention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.
Now l shall place the framed glass in this brown, unprepared...
Unprepared, mark you...
Unprepared brown paper bag. l shall now attempt to drive the steel nail through the glass without breaking the glass.
''lmpossible!'' l hear you say.
We shall see.
He ain't very good, even if he is a professor. l tell you what l'm going to do.
No, please don't go.
Don't leave now and regret lost opportunities later.
You, young sir. Would you care to warble like the storied nightingale?
With this inexpensive device, you can charm the very birds down from the trees, like so.
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.
One copper coin of the realm.
Carrie, l'm very surprised at you wandering off like this.
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.
Don't work. l've been cheated! ls that Professor Browne? lt is indeed, my dear.
How may l serve you?
Would you be interested in the mating call of the Brazilian bird of love?
Very useful, eh?
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.
Professor Browne, l am one of your pupils.
My dear lady, you are indeed an ornament to the college.
- Splendid.
- Not at all. l was shocked when you closed down the college without that most important last lesson. l'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.
But l must have the spell that comes with the last lesson!
The matter is closed. l bid you good day. l have an appointment at my club.
The matter is not closed!
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!
Here we are.
Will you get this child off my leg?
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Now l trust you'll behave more like a gentleman.
Look out!
There goes another rabbit.
What was all that about? l changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells.
My spell? From my school?
Not one of your best spells. lt doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.
But l don't understand. My spell?
They were just nonsense words from an old book.
They worked perfectly well for me.
They work for you?
Good woman! Some kind of destiny has brought us together.
You got these spells out of some old book, you say? l changed them round a bit. l gave them a bit of my own style, as it were.
The old sorcerers did have a bit of a tendency to waffle on.
But dear lady, l never thought l'd meet somebody like you.
What a treasure.
Mr Browne, will you please stick to the point. l would like to see this book immediately.
Certainly. lt's at my new town house.
Would you care to join me for luncheon?
We can discuss my ideas at the same time.
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.
You go round the other side. l always travel on the left.
Will you give the address to Paul, please?
May l ask how we are going to get there on this bed? Fly?
My dear Professor, with your own travelling spell.
The one you gave with the course as a bonus.
My travelling spell?
That works as well?
Just give the address, please.
8 Winchfield Road.
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.
Madam, is this vehicle safe?
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps, but then most good spells are.
We're here. l would never have believed it.
You must have given us the wrong address. Do you live here? ln fact, l do.
Temporarily, at any rate. l found the front door open.
The house was deserted.
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.
Why should they do that?
This probably has something to do with it.
Merciful heavens!
You should be terrified at the very idea of living here.
You would have thought so. l am by nature a little bit of a coward.
But then l pondered. ln the perverse nature of things, this diabolical object is probably the best friend l've ever had. lt enables me, for the first time in my life, to live like a king.
Shall we go in?
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise, but with a charming touch of innocence.
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?
Dear lady, you are relentless.
The book is in the library. We shall proceed there after our cheese and wine.
Why do you keep the curtains closed?
So that we may enjoy the gentle glow of candle light.
More likely so's a copper don't peek in and catch you hiding out here.
Why don't you have a look round the house?
- l want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.
Remember, this house does not belong to Mr Browne.
Mr Browne, where is that book? l must have that spell on substitutiary locomotion.
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.
Would you hold this, please?
What do you think of that?
- Well, l... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.
Think how successful l could be with an assistant who can really do magic.
Dear lady, have you ever considered entering show business?
- The what business?
- The theatre!
Pantomimes, village fairs, the seaside.
Brighton, Blackpool, follies on the prom. l have very important work to do.
Listen to me. We could make a packet.
Let us strike a bargain
You possess a gift
But I can speak the jargon
That will give your gift
the needed lift
You possess the know-how
And I command the show-how
Oh, how successful you could be
With me l'm afraid we're wasting valuable time.
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.
- Your first name.
- Eglantine.
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh, how you'll shine
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
As the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit
All you need to succeed
in your plan
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely
And I'm your man
For I have an acumen
that's nigh-superhuman
I sell things that nobody can
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest
I'm your man
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh how you'll shine
Will you stop?
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
What are you reading?
''lsle of Naboombu.''
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.
These pictures prove it, don't it?
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things. l like it.
Now where is the book?
Well? Where is it?
At last, Mr Browne!
''The Spells of Astoroth.''
Of course.
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.
Does one's nose have to twitch like this?
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.
Miss Price, a word about your tactics. l don't mind being changed into a hawk or a tiger or something with dash.
But always a fluffy white rabbit? lt's intolerable!
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.
''The ancient art of...''
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are...''
But the rest of the book is missing!
Now you see why l closed down the college.
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.
- Listen to me!
- l'm all ears.
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book? l bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.
He claimed that l'd given him a dud coin. l ask you!
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.
He got one half and l got the other.
- But where's the other half now?
- lt's probably been thrown away.
But if it still exists, there's only one place to find it.
- Where is that?
- Portobello Road
Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Anything and everything
a chap can unload
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road
You'll find what you want
in the Portobello Road
- Rare alabaster
- Genuine plaster
A filigreed samovar
owned by the tsars
- A pen used by Shelley
- A new Botticelli!
The snippers that clipped
old King Edward's cigars
Made in Hong Kong?
Two bob a dozen, would you say?
- Waterford crystal
- Napoleon's pistols
Society heirlooms with genuine gems
Rembrandts, El Grecos,
Toulouse-Lautrecos
Painted last week
on the banks of the Thames
Very interesting, but where do they sell books?
There's a little place around the corner.
Portobello Road, Portobello Road

You meet all your chums

Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
What l want is the other half of this book.
All in good time, my dear.
Burke's Peerage, The Bride Book,
The Fishmonger's Guidebook l'm looking for the other part of this.

Dented and tarnished,
scarred and unvarnished
In old Portobello...
This lady is looking for the other half of this book. lt's called ''The Spells of Astoroth''. l don't keep no torn or damaged books here.
What do you think l am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road
There's another bookstore along here somewhere.
You don't expect to sell a piano like that, do you?
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.
Portobello Road, Portobello Road
Happy things are happening
in Portobello Road
You feel like a ballerina
when you're hopping like a toad
When you kick your heels up
down in Portobello Road
Come on, ducks!
Come on, girls!
Lovely.
Oh, yeah, play the drums.
Closing time!
Bye!

Hey, governor. Something for the lady friend? Nylons?
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?
Now you have my undivided attention.
- What can l do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.
He wants to see you. You too.
Who is the Bookman? And what right has he got to order me about? l think we'd better ask questions later.
Excuse me.
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.
Why didn't you bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne, and half the Household Cavalry as well?
What's the bed for? lt's a present for you.
That's what he said.
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.
Except for this knob, which is mine.
Bookman, there's been bad blood between us long enough.
Let this gift begin friendship anew.
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug. lsn't that the section of the manuscript we've been looking for?
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.
A charming young woman of my acquaintance.
Miss Price, l've been looking for this other bit a long time.
Mr Swinburne told me you were in the market making enquiries.
And here we are. l don't mind saying, to see it all together at last...
- There isn't much l wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne. ls that clear? lt's all like a jolly detective story or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?
We're both after the same spell.
You have one clue, l have the other.
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing seems to be for us to cooperate. l assume you're looking for the same thing l am.
May l?
This is quite a moment for both of us.
''Substitutiary locomotion, the lost miracle of the ancients.''
And so on and so forth.
Here we are.
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are... engraved on the star that was always worn by the sorcerer Astoroth.''
But where are the words of the spell? l assumed they'd be in your half of the manuscript. l thought they'd be in yours!
Once again, a dead end. l shall never know the secret. lsn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.
Pity it's so small you can't read the writing.
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,
Astoroth kept animals in cages in search for the spells that would make them more like humans.
The legend is that finally the animals rebelled at the experiment, killed Astoroth and stole many of his powers. lncluding the star with the spell on it.
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away and were never heard of again.
However, there is a final notation in my half of the book saying that in the 1 7th century a shipwrecked lascar was taken from the sea half mad with thirst and exposure to the sun.
Before he died, he swore he had seen an island ruled by animals.
Where?
There is, l regret to say, no such island. l looked for it in every chart.
The lsle of Naboombu does not exist. lt does too! Got my own...
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!
When he don't say nothing, he mumbles. l wish the child to speak!
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.
- lt's just a children's book.
- l'll be the judge of that.
- Give it to me.
- No.
Please don't annoy me.
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it? lf it's all the same to you, l'd rather use my own.
Sentiment, you know.
Come along, Paul. lt's time to go.
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.
Observe the fundamental weakness of the criminal mind.
- You will believe no one or anything.
- l understand.
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.
He's up to something, you know.
Before your very eyes, l shall cause this bed and the occupants on it to disappear. l should like to see a cheap-jack tenth-rate entertainer do a trick like that.
''Cheap-jack entertainer.''
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.
- Where to?
- To the lsland of Naboombu.
- l'm very curious about that place.
- Good.
Bed, take us to the lsland of Naboombu.
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!
Beastly climate. l never did fancy the sea.
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course. l've never seen no island like this before. l'm afraid we may have fallen into the lagoon.
That's right.
Here we are on page three.
Oi, Mr Codfish!
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.
Now l'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.
Not too bright, is he?
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.
Mr Codfish, where is the lsland of Naboombu?
You mean the land part? Oh, that.
Straight up. You can't miss it.
None of my business, of course, but l shouldn't go there if l were you.
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.
Trouble or not, we should be getting along.
- l wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush? lt's really rather splendid down here. For you, my dear.
Thank you.
How pleasant...
Bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants and creatures
of the deep
We glide
Far below the rolling tide
Serene
Through the bubbly blue and green
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What if the octopus,
the flounder and the cod
Think we're rather odd?
It's fun to promenade
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Look!
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants
and creatures of the deep
It's grand
When you're dancing on the sand
Each glance
Bubbles over with romance
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along through the water
Where we get along swimmingly
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above
- Two beneath the blue
- Could even fall in love
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom of the beautiful briny,
shimmery shiny
Beautiful briny sea
Bravo!
Most exciting, most exciting.
You've won the ruddy cup.
Help!
This time l really caught a whopper!
People! Oh, no!
What scurvy luck.
- My goodness!
- l'll deal with this, my dear.
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain. l used to be a bit of a seafaring man myself.
Many's the time l've shipped out of Portsmouth.
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.
Now stow it, mate.
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading? lt says... ''No peopling allowed.''
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.
That means l've got to throw you all back. That's what to do.
Wait it minute! lt says here that anybody can see the king.
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?
Here in my book.
So it do.
But if you people knew what was good for you, you'd get yourselves all throwed back.
The king don't like people!
Nonetheless, we must see the king on an urgent personal matter.
Please lead the way.
But just don't say l didn't warn you. See?
Follow me.
Get out of here!
Yes. What can l do for you? l caught some people down at the sea lagoon.
They want to see the king.
Really? Well, we can't be bothered with that sort of thing now, can we? l don't know that l fancy this.
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer, l am considered not without talent.
Perhaps l can cheer him up.
No, no. You don't understand.
As everyone knows,
His Majesty is the world's greatest soccer player.
But due to a technical problem, the Royal Cup match cannot take place today.
And His Majesty had so set his heart on it!
Throw these... creatures back into the sea.
Aye, aye, sir.
Just a moment! l can help!
Do you really think so? l'd be most grateful.
Do you know soccer?
Do l know anything about soccer?
Why, l was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.
Three seasons with Manchester United...
Yes, yes. You'll do.
Come this way, please.
Mr Browne, are you certain you'll be all right?
Now what?
Not an ideal person in many respects, but Mr Browne is a very brave man.
Do you think he's done for?
Do you think so? l can't tell you how l appreciate this.
For some reason we have great difficulty finding referees round here. lf there be one thing we like, it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!
What's he got round his neck?
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.
Ah, yes.
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.
The Star of Astoroth!
You're to sit in His Majesty's royal box.
No littering, no chewing, no fruit or wrappers or sweets. Please.
Rise, please.
Loyal fans, this is official.
We have a volunteer referee.
Let the match begin!
He's still wearing it!
Right, Dirty Yellows, let's have a clean game.
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.
Weird sort of game they play here.
Hurry up! Get rid of it!
Gracious!
You're doing fine, matey.
Move it around.
Get on with the match!
- Foul!
- They're only animals.
That's no excuse for dirty football.
Ref, are you blind?
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.
The king makes them up as he goes along.
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?
Well, he's moving.
Steady, matey. Move it around.
He almost had it then.
Looks like he's done for this time.
Don't just stand there! Head it in!
Stop... that... ball!
Goal!
Game's over. l win.
Let me give you a hand, matey.
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.
Please, let me help you on with your robe.
Why, yes. Thank you.
Can't have you catching cold, sire, can we?
Why, no.
Have you ever heard of something called the gypsy switch?
No, can't say that l have.
Remind me to tell you about it some time. l can't tell you when we've had such a good time.
We'll carry your memory in our hearts for a long while. l think it's time to leave.
Must you go?
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
Friendly lot.
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?
Your Royal Star!
They've stolen your Royal Star!
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you think this is?
Why didn't you say so?
Paul, put the knob on the bed.
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee. l'll keep it.
Women always lose things.
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- lt's stuck!
- l suppose l'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.
Got it.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...
Oh, bother. l do hate shoddy work. l shall never get used to this thing.
Will you push the bed back into place, please? l think we could all do with a nice cup of tea.
No time. l've gone to a lot of trouble to find this spell. l'm going to try it immediately.
Mr Browne, kindly let me have your shoes, please.
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for? lf you'd been paying attention l should think you'd be aware that substitutiary locomotion is the art of causing inanimate objects to take on a life force of their own. l must have inanimate objects to experiment with.
Makes sense, don't it?
Stand back, everyone. l need plenty of room. l want you all to be absolutely quiet.
Mr Browne, you have the Star of Astoroth, l believe.
Oh, yes. lt's in my nice clean hanky. lt's all right, Mr Browne. l should have realised that it would be impossible to take an object from one world into another. lf only l would have had the sense to remember the words on that star.
- l know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.
Why don't you and l nip out and get something for supper?
And l might conceivably call into the pub for a pint to steady my nerves. l do know the words, Miss Price.
How can you know the words when Miss Price doesn't?
Troop movements and massing
of barges in French and Dutch ports.
The prime minister
has told the nation
to be on the alert for signs
of a possible invasion.
That was the news. l might have been able to do something about this. lt's out of your hands now, my dear. lf only l could have remembered those words. lt's maddening.
Why don't someone ask me?
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember those kind of words.
You mean like ''Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee''?
- How do you know that?
- Easy.
Says so right here in my book.
You mean it was there in your book all the time?
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Nothing happened!
Am l doing something wrong?
Well, it does seem a bit old-fashioned.
After all, we are in the 20th century.
- What do you suggest?
- lt needs rhythm. Tempo.
Music.
As l always say, do it with a flair.
- Do you mind if l have a go?
- Of course not.
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Substitutiary locomotion
Mystic power that's far
beyond the wildest notion
It's so weird, so feared,
yet wonderful to see
Substitutiary locomotion come to me
Now!
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
I don't want locomotiary substitution
Or remote intransecory convolution
Only one precise solution is the key
Substitutiary locomotion it must be
Substitutiary locomotion
Lovely substitutiary locomotion
You've made substitutiary history
With treguna mekoides
and a little help from me
- With treguna mekoides and...
- Trecorum satis dee
Mr Browne, what is going on here? l haven't the foggiest.
How do you do?
Shall we?
- That's my nightgown!
- ls it really, my dear? l'm not responsible for its behaviour.
Obviously not, my dear.
Paul, what on earth are you doing?
Having a jolly good time, that's what.
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? lt's most agreeable.
But we must do something.
Didn't l give you my all-purpose cut-off spell?
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.
- Yes, number eight l think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!
Mr Browne, will you please control your shoes?
Dear lady, l very much fear that we have nothing under control.
Do you mind?
Now, who would like some more of my lovely sausages and mash?
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie? l've already had two helpings.
- l'm full.
- Me, too.
At least somebody wants some.
Cheer up, my dear. This should be something of a celebration. l'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be much to celebrate.
- l still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.
You just need a little more practice.
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.
Meantime, there's nothing to liven the spirits like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice and a touch of genius.
Never happened to me before. l don't usually juggle with cats under my feet.
Look! She's laughing!
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- l can't stop, my dear. l've just come by to bring you the good news.
Mr Bistlethwaite, who brings the milk, you know?
He's promised to take the children in!
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.
Put a bit of colour back in their cheeks.
Why, what's the matter? l thought you'd be pleased.
You told me yourself that you had no time to take care of children.
Circumstances have changed somewhat.
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?
Of course. You do want him to stay with us, don't you, Miss Price? l suppose l hadn't really thought about it.
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne? lt's all rather sudden! l don't quite know what to say.
Then l'll leave you two to talk it over. l'll come back in the morning!
Good night! lt is true, Mr Browne. You are going to be our father now, aren't you?
We are rather rushing things, aren't we?
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things besides you children to think about.
Yes. As a matter of fact l should have left ages ago. l must get a train back to London tonight. lt's rather an important matter. l'd like to tell you about it, but it's a little bit hush-hush.
Sort of a secret.
Well... if... lf l've been any sort of help to you, l'm pleased.
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you. l've enjoyed being with you.
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.
Will you be coming back?
Some day, my dear. l certainly hope that we shall meet again.
Some day.
When all this war business is over.
- l see.
- Perhaps l shall realise my dream.
Eglantine and Emelius: illusionists extraordinary!
Just think how that will look on the poster.
The children are going to miss you.
- You really think they will?
- Yes.
Well, l shall miss you. All of you. lf l don't go now you might never get rid of me.
Goodbye, Carrie.
- Must you really go?
- l think it's best for everybody.
- Goodbye, Paul.
- l think you should be our father.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Do you want me to come down to the station with you?
No, no. You stay here and look after everybody.
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. tomorrow morning.
- Mind if l await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.
Good night.
Out you go, Cosmic.
Hello?
Emelius Browne, do you know
you could be warm and cosy
in that house at this very moment?
For once in your useless life,
you really seem to have been needed.
You're a failure, Emelius Browne,
and a coward.
No, Fräulein, this is not the invasion, just a little exercise.
A minor raid to induce panic and to spread a little mischief.
When you English get it through your head that the German forces can land whenever and wherever we please, perhaps you will consider reasonable peace.
Not bloody likely!
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him. l must say, it's very tempting.
Colonel, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit? l said, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit?
Be quiet, please.
Filigree, apogee, epogee...
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.
Would you kindly fetch my notebook from the workroom?
Righto.
Silence!
We have work to do. l am sorry, but l must send all of you some place where you will no longer be a nuisance.
As the words sell the tune
And the moonbeams the moon
All I need to succeed in my plan
Is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair
Eglantine!
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.
Confound it, can't women ever learn to file things properly?
Here it is.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.
Filigree... apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Come along. For once in your life, you've got to believe in something.
That's it. Good lad.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
What's the use of putting us in that draughty castle? lt's quite chilly.
The colonel believes when a British female decides to become a nuisance, she can become the greatest nuisance in the world, and l'm inclined to agree with him.
You need a lesson in manners. lf l had my notebook, l'd make certain you'd learn a few.
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!
Take it easy, can't you?
- Try holding your breath.
- l am holding it.
We could strip him down and grease him with soap.
No, it's no good. We can't do it. l could have told you that in the first place. lf we can't get Paul out we'll just have to think of something else.
What about that spell that makes things move about?
- But l'd need weapons.
- How about all these things? l'm afraid they're a bit ancient.
- Where did this come from?
- lt's Mr Browne!
He's on his way to London.
Mr Browne? lf you are Mr Browne, would you get off my lap? lt is Mr Browne! lt is you!
You didn't think that l could do that spell, did you? l am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?
What's wrong with the substitutiary locomotion spell?
- That ought to be useful.
- lt isn't ready yet.
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.
We can't let these so-and-sos get away with their beastly little raid.
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.
Let's hope you haven't forgotten the spell.
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.
Probably not magic, but it might make you feel more at home.
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.
Treguna... mekoides... trecorum... satis dee.
Look!
Sound the advance!
Just in time for the kick-off.
Steady on the left.
Victory for England and St George!
Like a Lord Mayor's show!
Pikemen, hold your distance.
Treguna mekoides
and trecorum satis dee
Blimey!
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.
Come on, lads! After me.
Good shooting, bowmen!
Well caught, sir. Very good.
Knock his block off! That's it!
Mr Browne, make those children take cover!
Are you still there, Colonel? l thought you'd be on your way by now.
You see? Things may not be so easy for you after all.
Goodbye, Colonel!
Eglantine.
Dear Mr Browne.
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.
There they are, lads! l said something was afoot!
All right. Drive them into the sea.
Firing positions. Both sides.
All right, men. Hold your fire. l think we've taught the Hun a lesson.
He'll think twice before coming back here again. lt's tragic. All your spells, your equipment. All gone.
Still, l was able to perform some small service first.
That mean you ain't gonna be a witch no more? Never?
No, Paul. l realised some time ago that l could never be a proper witch.
Was it that first magic moment when you laid eyes on me?
No. lt was the day my poisoned dragon's liver arrived. l knew that anyone who felt the way l did about poisoned dragon's liver had no business being a witch.
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, l think so. lt's much too dangerous being a civilian.
Take care of yourself, guv. l'll do that. And l'll be back before you've grown an inch taller.
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.
Well, here we go.
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.
Parade, by the right, quick march!
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.
Still got this, ain't l?

I know you
I waked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions
are seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did
once upon a dream
"In a far away land
long ago lived a King...
"and his fair Queen.
"Many years had they longed
for a child...
"and finally
their wish was granted.
"A daughter was born,
and they called her Aurora."
Sweet Aurora
"Yes, they named her
after the dawn...
"for she filled their lives
with sunshine.
"Then a great holiday
was proclaimed...
"throughout the kingdom...
"so that all of high
or low estate...
"might pay homage
to the infant Princess.
"And our story begins
on that most joyful day."
On that joyful day
On that joyful day
Joyfully now
to our Princess we come
Bringing gifts
and all good wishes
To replete
our loyalty anew
Hail to the Princess Aurora
All of her subjects
adore her
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen
Hail to the Princess Aurora
Health to the Princess,
wealth to the Princess
Long live
the Princess Aurora
Hail Aurora
Hail Aurora
Health to the Princess,
wealth to the Princess
Long Live
the Princess Aurora
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen
Hail to the Princess Aurora
"Thus,
on this great and joyous day...
"did all the kingdom celebrate
the Awaited-awaited royal birth...
"and good King Stefan
and his Queen made welcome...
"their Lifelong friend."
Their Royal Highnesses...
King Hubert
and Prince Philip!
"Fondly had these
monarchs dreamed one day...
"their kingdoms to unite...
"thus, today would they
announce...
"that Philip,
Hubert's son and heir...
"to Stefan's child
would be betrothed."

his gift he brought...

on his future bride."
Their most honored
and exalted Excellencies...
the three good fairies...
Mistress Flora...
Mistress Fauna...
and Mistress Merryweather!
- Ahh.
- Oh.
The little darling.
Your Majesties.
Each of us the child may bless... with a single gift... no more, no less.
Little Princess, my gift shall be... the gift of beauty.
One gift
Beauty rare
Gold of sunshine
in her hair
Lips that shame
the red, red rose
She'll walk with springtime
wherever she goes
Tiny Princess... my gift shall be the gift of song.
One gift
The gift of song
Melody her whole life Long
The nightingales
her tune adore
Bringing his sweet
serenade to her door
Sweet Princess, my gift shall be the...
Wind howls]
Why, it's Maleficent.
What does she want here?
Shhh.
Well...
Quite a glittering assemblage, King Stefan.
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and... ah ha ha ha ha... how quaint.
Even the rabble.
Ooooh.
I really felt quite distressed... at not receiving an invitation.
You weren't wanted.
Not wa... ah ha.
Oh, dear, what an awkward situation.
I had hoped
it was merely due...
to some oversight.
Well, in that event,
I'd best be on my way.
And... you're not offended,
Your Excellency?
Why, no, Your Majesty... and to show I bear no ill will...
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.
Listen well, all of you.
The Princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty... beloved by all who know her.
But... before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday... she shall prick her finger...
on the spindle
of a spinning wheel...
and die!
Oh, no!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Seize that creature!
Stand back, you fools!
Don't despair,
Your Majesties.
Merryweather still has her gift to give.
Then she can undo this fearful curse?
Oh, no, sire.
Maleficent's powers are far too great.
But she can help.
But...
Just do
your best, dear.
Yes, go on.
Sweet Princess...
If through this
wicked witch's trick...
a spindle should
your finger prick...
a ray of hope
there still may be in this...
the gift I give to thee.
Not in death,
but just in sleep...
this fateful prophecy
you'll keep...
and from this slumber
you shall wake...
when true love's kiss
the spell shall break.
For true Love
conquers all
"But King Stefan...
"still fearful
of his daughter's Life...
"did then and there decree...
"that every spinning wheel
in the kingdom...
"should on that very day
be burned.
"So 'rwas done."
Oh, silly...
Now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear.
I'm sure it will work out somehow.
Well, a bonfire won't stop Maleficent.
Of course not, but what will?
Perhaps if we
reason with her...
Reason?
With Maleficent?
Well, she can't be all bad.
Oh, yes, she can.
Oooh. I'd like to turn her into a fat, old hop toad.
Now, dear, that isn't a very nice thing to say.
Besides, we can't.
You know our magic doesn't work that way. it can only do good, dear... to bring joy and happiness.
Well, that would make me happy.
But there must be some way.
But there must be some way.
There is!
There is?
What is it, Flora?
I'm going to...
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[QUIETLY
Even walls have ears.
Follow me.
I'll turn her into a flower.
Maleficent?
No, no, dear, the Princess.
Oh, she'd make a lovely flower.
Don't you see?
A flower can't prick its finger. it hasn't any.
That's right.
She'll be perfectly safe.
Until Maleficent sends a frost.
Yes. Er...
Oh, dear.
She always ruins your nicest flowers.
You're right... and she'll be expecting us to do something like that.
Oooh.
Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.
Maleficent doesn't know anything about love... or kindness or the joy of helping others.
You know, sometimes
I don't think...
she's really very happy.
That's it.
Of course.
It's the only thing she can't understand... and won't expect.
Oh!
Now, now, now... we have to plan it carefully.
Let's see,
the woodcutter's cottage.
Yes, yes, yes,
the abandoned one.
Of course, the King and Queen will object...
but when we explain
it's the only way...
Explain what?
About the three peasant women raising a foundling child... deep in the forest.
Oh?
Well, that's very nice of them.
Who are they?
Turn around.
- Why, it's us!
- Uh-huh.
You mean we us?
Uh-huh.
Take care of the baby?
Why not?
Oh, I'd like that!
Well, y-yes, but we'd have to feed it...
And wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep.
Oh, I'd love it.
You really think we can?
If humans can do it, so can we.
And we'd have our magic to help us.
That's right.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No magic.
I'll take those wands right now.
Oh, better get rid of those wings, too.
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?
Uh-huh.
But now... now we don't know how.
We've never done anything without magic.
And that's why Maleficent will never suspect.
But who'll wash and cook?
Oh, we'll all pitch in.
I'll take care of the baby.
Let me have it, dear.
Come along, now.
We must tell
Their Majesties at once.
Flora.
Flora.
 "So the King
and his Queen watched...
"with heavy hearts...
"as their most precious
possession, their only child...
"disappeared into the night."
"Many sad and lonely years
passed by...
"for King Stefan
and his people.
"But as the time
for the Princess's...
"sixteenth birthday
drew near...
"the entire kingdom
began to rejoice...
"for everyone knew...
"that as Long
as Maleficent's domain...
"the forbidden mountains...
"thundered with her wrath
and frustration...
"her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled."
It's incredible!
Sixteen years, and not a trace of her!
She couldn't have vanished
into thin air!
Are you sure you searched everywhere?
Yeah, yeah, uh...
Everywhere... we all did.
Yeah! Yeah!
And what about the town?
The forest? The mountains?
Uh, we check mountains... uh... uh, forest...
Uh, houses and, uh, let me see, uh... and all the cradles.
Cradles?
Uh, yep, yep.
Ha ha ha ha.
Every cradle.
Cradle?!
Did you hear that, my pet?
All these years...
they've been looking
for a baby.
Oh, ha ha ha!
Fools!
Idiots!
Imbeciles!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
Ooh! Ooh!
Ouch! Ouch!
Ahhh.
Oh, they're hopeless... a disgrace to the forces of evil.
Oh, my pet.
You are my last hope.
Circle far and wide.
Search for a maid of sixteen, with hair of sunshine gold... and lips red as the rose.
Go, and do not fail me.
"And so,
for sixteen Long years...
"the whereabouts
of the Princess...
"remained a mystery...
"while deep in the forest
in a woodcutter's cottage...
"the good fairies carried out
their well-laid plan.
"Living like mortals...
"they had reared the child
as their own...
"and called her Briar Rose."
"On this,
her sixteenth birthday...
"the good fairies
had planned a party...
"and something extra special
for a surprise."
Well, now, how about this one?
This is the one I picked.
Ooh, she'll look beautiful in that.
Now, I thought a few changes here.
Uh-huh.
Don't forget a pretty bow.
Yes, and raise the shoulder line.
We'll make it blue.
Oh, no, dear, pink.
Of course, we'll need a few pleats.
Yes, but how are
we going to get her...
out of the house?
I'll think
of something.
Well.
And what are you
three dears up to?
- Up to?
- Up to?
Up to? Er, er...
We... we want you to pick some berries.
That's it... berries.
- Berries?
- Lots of berries.
But I picked berries yesterday.
Oh, we need more, dear.
Lots, lots more.
Yes.
Now, don't hurry back, dear.
But don't go too far.
And don't speak to strangers.
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye!
Good-bye!
I wonder if she suspected.
Of course not.
Come on.
Oh, will she be surprised.
A real birthday party... with a real birthday cake.
Yes, and a dress a Princess can be proud of.
I'll get the wands.
Yes, you g... the wands?
Oh, no!
No magic.
But the sixteen years are almost over.
We're taking no chances.
But I've never baked a fancy cake.
Oh, you won't have to, dear.
I'm going to bake the cake.
You?
Oh, she's always wanted to, dear... and this is her last chance.
Well...
I'm going to make it fifteen layers... with pink and blue forget-me-nots.
And I'm making the dress.
But you can't sew, and she's never cooked.
Oh, ho, ho, it's simple.
All you do is follow the book.
Up here, dear.
You can be the dummy.
Well, I still say we ought to use magic.
 La la
la da da da da
Dee dee dee deedle um
La da da
"Flour, 3 cups."
Cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups.
Oh.
Dee da dee da da dum
What's that for?
Well, it's got to have a hole in the bottom.
That's for the feet
to go through.
It's pink.
Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?
But I wanted it blue.
Now, dear... we decided pink was her color.
You decided.
"Two eggs, fold in gently."
Fold?
Oh, well.
I can't breathe!
Get me out of here! it looks awful.
That's because it's on you, dear.
"Now yeast, 1 tsp."
Tsp?
One teaspoon.
One teaspoon! Of course!
Hmm.
Oh, gracious!
How that child has grown!
Oh, it seems only yesterday we brought her here.
Just a tiny baby.
Why, Merryweather!
Whatever is the matter, dear?
After today, she'll be a Princess... and we won't have any Briar Rose.
Oh, Flora!
Now, now, now, now.
W-we... we all knew this day had to come.
But why did it have to come so soon?
After all... we've had her for sixteen years.
Sixteen wonderful years.
Good gracious!
We're acting like a lot of ninnies!
Come on! She'll be back before we get started.
Do you hear that, Samson?
Beautiful!
What is it?
Come on. Let's find out.
Aw, come on.
For an extra bucket of oats?
And a few... carrots?
Hup, boy!
Whoa!
No carrots.
I wonder
I wonder
I wonder why
each little bird
Has a someone
To sing to
Sweet things to
A gay, little lark melody
I wonder
I wonder
If my heart
keeps singing
Will my song
go winging
To someone
Who'll find me
And bring back
a Love song to me
Oh, dear.
Why do they still treat me like a child?
Whoo!
Aunt Flora, Aunt Fauna...
Aunt Merryweather.
They never want me to meet anyone.
But you know something?
Whispering]
I fooled them.
I have met someone.
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Oh... a Prince.
Well, he's tall and handsome and... and so romantic!
Oh, we walk together and talk together... and just before we say good-bye... he takes me in his arms...
And then...
I wake up.
Yes,
it's only in my dreams.
But they say if you dream
a thing more than once... it's sure to come true.
And I've seen him so many times.
You know, Samson... there's something strange about that voice.
Too beautiful to be real.
Maybe it was
some mysterious being... a... a wood sprite or a...
Here! Stop!
Why,
it's my dream Prince!
Your Highness.
You know, I'm really not supposed... to speak to strangers... but we've met before.
I know you
I waked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions are seldom
all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
upon a dream
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did
once upon a dream
Oh!
Oh!
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Oh, it... wasn't that.
It's just that you're a... a...
A stranger?
Mm-hmm.
But don't you remember?
We've met before.
We... we have?
Well, of course.
You said so yourself.
"Once upon a dream."
I know you
I walked with you
once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions are
seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
Upon a dream
Who are you?
What's your name?
Hmm?
Oh. My name.
Why, it's... it's...
Oh, no, no! I can't! I...
Good-bye!
But when will I see you again?
Oh, never! Never!
Never!
Well... maybe someday.
When? Tomorrow?
Oh, no. This evening.
Where?
At the cottage, in the glen.
There.
Whoop!
Well, what do you think of it?
Why, it... it's a very unusual cake, isn't it?
Yes.
Of course, it will be much stiffer after it's baked.
Of course, dear.
Um... what do you think of the dress?
Well, it... it's...
It-it's not exactly...
the way it is in
the book, is it?
Oh, I improved it.
But perhaps if I added a few more ruffles... uh, what do you think?
Um... I think so.
What do you think,
Merryweather?
I think we've had enough of this nonsense!
I think we ought to think of Rose and what she'll think of this mess!
I still think what
I thunk before.
I'm going to get those wands!
You know... I think she's right.
Here they are!
Good as new!
Uh, uh, tut,
tut, tut, tut...
C-c-careful, Merryweather.
Quick!
Lock the doors.
Fauna,
you close the windows.
Oh, plug up every cranny.
We can't take any chances.
Now, you take care of the cake.
While I...
Clean the room, dear.
And I'll make the dress.
Now, hurry!
Ooh!
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.
Flora says,
"Clean up the room."
And now, to make a lovely dress fit to grace a fair Princess.
Eggs, flour, lemon
Just do it like it says here in the book.
I'll put on the candles.
Oh, no! Not pink!
Oh, no! Not pink!
Make it blue!
Merryweather!
Make it pink.
Whispering]
Make it blue.
Oh! Pink!
Blue!
Oh, now look
what you've done!
Shh! Shh! Listen!
It's Rose!
She's back!
Enough of this foolishness!
Make it pink.
Now hide! Quick!
Whispering]
Blue!
Aunt Flora!
Good gracious!
Who left the mop running?
Stop, mop!
Aunt Flora!
Fauna! Merryweather!
Where is everybody?
Oh!
Surprise! Surprise!
Happy Birthday!
Oh, you darlings!
This is the happiest day of my life!
Everything's so wonderful!
Just wait till you meet him!
Him?
Rose!
You've met some stranger?
Oh, he's not a stranger.
We've met before.
You have?
Where?
Once upon a dream.
I know you
I walked with you
once upon a dream
She's in love!
- Oh, no!
- This is terrible!
Why?
After all, I am sixteen. it isn't that, dear.
You're already betrothed.
Betrothed?
Since the day you were born.
To Prince Phillip, dear.
But that's impossible.
How could I marry a Prince?
I'd have to be...
A Princess.
And you are, dear.
Princess Aurora.
Tonight, we're taking you back
to your father, King Stefan.
But... but I can't!
He's coming here tonight.
I promised to meet him.
I'm sorry, child.
But you must never see that young man again.
Oh, no! No!
I can't believe it!
No! No!
And we thought she'd be so happy.
No sign of her yet, Hubert.
Of course not.
It's a good half-hour till sunset.
Ah, excellent bird.
Mmm!
Aw, now, come, man!
Buck up!
Battle's over.
Girl is
as good as here.
I'm sorry, Hubert... but after sixteen years of worrying... never knowing...
The past! All in the past!
Tonight,
we toast the future... with something I've been saving for sixteen years.
Here!
To the future!
Right, Hubert.
To the future!
Skumps! Skumps!
Skumps!
A toast to this night
The outlook is rosy
The future is bright
Our children
will marry
Our kingdoms unite
Skumps, skumps,
skumps
Ah!
Excellent vintage!
And now, to the new home, eh?
New home?
Children need a nest of their own, what?
A place to raise their
little brood, eh?
Well,
I suppose, in time.
Of course! To the home!
- Skumps!
- Skumps!
A toast to the home
One grander, by far
Than a palace in Rome
Uh, let me fill up your glass.
Ha! Ha! That last was all foam.
Skumps, skumps, skumps
The plans!
Weir,
what do you think?
Nothing elaborate, of course.
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.
Honeymoon cottage, really.
You... you mean... you're building it already?
Built, man! Finished!
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
But, Hubert, they're not even married yet!
I'll take care of that tonight.
To the wedding!
Now, hold on, Hubert.
I haven't even seen
my daughter yet...
and you're taking her
away from me.
Getting
my Philip, aren't you?
Yes, but...
Want to see our
grandchildren, don't we?
Of course, but...
Well, there's no time to lose.
Getting on in years.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
To the wedding!
Now,
be reasonable, Hubert.
After all, Aurora knows
nothing about all this.
- Well?
- Well, it... it... may come as quite a shock.
Shock?!
My Phillip a shock?!
What's wrong with my Phillip?
Nothing, Hubert.
I only meant...
Why doesn't your daughter like my son?
Now, now...
I'm not so sure my son likes your daughter!
Now, see here...
I'm not so sure my grandchildren... want you for a grandfather!
Why, you... you unreasonable... pompous, blustering, old windbag!
Unreasonable? Pompous?
En garde, sir!
I warn you, Hubert!
This means war!
Forward!
For honor! For country! For...
What's this all about, anyway?
Nothing, Hubert.
Absolutely nothing.
The children are bound to fall in love with each other.
Precisely.
And as for grandchildren...
I'll have the royal woodcarvers... start work on the cradle tomorrow!
Splendid!
King size, of course?
Certainly.
To the Woodcarver's Guild!
His Royal Highness...
Prince Philip!
Phillip!
Oh, Phillip!
Phillip!
Phillip! Hold, Phillip!
H-hurry, boy!
Hurry! Change into something suitable!
Can't meet your future bride looking like that.
But I have met her, Father.
You have? Where?
Once upon a dream.
Phillip!
Stop! Stop that!
Phillip! P-put me down!
Now... what's all this dream nonsense? it wasn't a dream, Father.
I really did meet her.
The Princess Aurora?
Good heavens!
We must tell Stefan!
Why, this is the most...
I didn't say it was Aurora.
You most certainly did!
You... you said that...
I said I met the girl
I was going to marry.
I don't know who she was.
A peasant girl,
I suppose...
A peasant g-girl?
You're... you're going to marry a...
Why, Phillip!
You're joking!
Uh... isn't he?
No! Y-you can't do this to me!
Give up the throne?
The kingdom?
For some... some nobody?
By Harry, I won't have it!
You're a Prince!
And you're going to marry a Princess!
Now, Father, you're living in the past.
This is the 14th century.
Nowadays...
Nowadays,
I'm still the King!
And I command you to come to your senses!
And marry the girl I love.
- Exactly!
- Good-bye, Father.
"Good-bye, Father.
Marry the girl you..."
No, no!
No, no, Phillip, stop!
Come back!
Oh, Philip!
Phillip!
Oh!
Oh, how... how will
I ever tell Stefan?
Whispering]
Come along, now.
All right, in here, dear.
Bolt the door,
Merryweather!
Fauna, pull the drapes!
And now, dear, if you'll just sit here.
This one last gift... dear child for thee... the symbol of thy royalty.
A crown to wear in grace and beauty, as is thy right and royal duty.
Now, dear.
Whispering]
Come.
Let her have a few moments alone.
It's that boy she met.
Whatever are we going to do?
Oh, I don't see why she has to marry any old Prince.
Now, that's not for us to decide, dear.
Maybe we should tell King Stefan about the boy.
Well, why don't we?
Listen!
Maleficent! Rose!
Rose! Rose! Aah!
Oh, why did
we leave her alone?
Rose! Rose!
Here.
Rose! Rose!
Rose, where are you?
Where are you?
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose, don't touch anything!
Touch the spindle.
Touch it, I say!
You poor, simple fools.
Thinking you could defeat me.
Me, the mistress
of all evil!
Well, here's your precious Princess.
Rose!
Oh, Rose!
Oh, I'll never forgive myself.
We're all to blame!
Stefan, there's... there's something important
I have to tell you.
Not now, Hubert.
But it's about Phillip.
Phillip?
Oh, yes, of course, Phillip.
Why, where is the boy?
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Well, send for him immediately!
- But...
- Shh!
The sun has set!
Make ready to welcome
your Princess!
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.
They'll be heartbroken when they find out.
They're not going to.
They aren't?
We'll put them all to sleep... until Rose awakens.
Come!
Sleeping beauty fair
Gold of sunshine
In your hair
Lips that shame
The red, red rose
Dreaming of true Love
In slumber repose
One day he will come
Riding out of the dawn
And you'll awaken
To Love's first kiss
Till then,
Sleeping Beauty
Sleep on
One day you'll awaken
To Love's first kiss
Till then,
Sleeping Beauty
Sleep on
Well, just been talking to Phillip.
Seems he's fallen in love with some...
Peasant girl.
Peasant girl?
Yes? Yes?
The peasant girl... who is she?
Where did he meet her?
Just some peasant girl he met.
Where?! Where?!
Once upon a dream.
Once upon a dr...
Rose! Prince Phillip!
Oh! Oh!
Come on.
We've got to get back to the cottage.
Whistling
Once Upon a Dream]
Come in!
Well... this is a pleasant surprise.
I set my trap for a peasant, and lo,
I catch a Prince!
Away with him.
But gently, my pets... gently.
I have plans for our royal guest.
Maleficent!
She's got Prince Phillip!
At the forbidden mountain.
But we can't!
We can't go there!
We can, and we must!
What a pity Prince Phillip... can't be here to enjoy the celebration.
Come.
We must go to the dungeon and cheer him up.
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.
Why so melancholy?
A wondrous future lies before you.
You, the destined hero... of a charming fairy tale come true.
Behold...
King Stefan's castle...
And in yonder
topmost tower...
Dreaming of her true Love...
the Princess Aurora.
But see the gracious
whim of fate.
Why, 'tis the selfsame
peasant maid...
who won the heart
of our noble Prince...
but yesterday.
She is indeed
most wondrous fair.
Gold of sunshine
in her hair.
Lips that shame
the red, red rose.
In ageless sleep...
she finds repose.
The years roll by... but a hundred years to a steadfast heart... are but a day.
And now the gates
of a dungeon part...
and our Prince
is free to go his way.
Off he rides
on his noble steed...
a valiant figure...
straight and tall... to wake his love... with love's first kiss...
and prove that true Love
conquers all.
Why, you... you...
Come, my pet.
Let us leave our noble Prince... with these happy thoughts.
A most gratifying day.
For the first time in sixteen years...
I shall sleep well.
Shh! No time to explain.
Wait, Prince Phillip.
The road to true love may be barred... by still many more dangers...
which you alone
will have to face.
So arm thyself... with this enchanted shield of virtue...
and this mighty sword
of truth.
For these weapons
of righteousness...
will triumph over evil.
Now, come. We must hurry.
Whinnies]
Phillip, watch out!
Silence!
You, tell those fools to...
No! No!
Watch out, Phillip!
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb.
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb.
Born through the skies on a fog of doom.
Now go with the curse
and serve me well...
Round Stefan's castle...
Cast my spell!
Whinnies]
Whinnies]
No, it cannot be!
Now shall you deal with me, o Prince... and all the powers of hell!
Whinnies]
Up! Up this way!
Now, Sword of Truth, fly swift and sure... that evil die and good endure!
Oh, oh, uh, forgive me, Hubert.
The wine.
Now, uh, you were saying?
Huh? I was?
Oh, oh, yes.
Well, after all, Stefan... this is the 14th century.
Yes. You, uh... you said that a moment ago.
Well, to come right to the point... my son Phillip says he's going to marry...
It's Aurora. She's here!
And... and... and Phillip!
What does this mean, boy?
I... I don't...
But, but, but...
I don't understand.
Why, Fauna, what's the matter, dear?
Oh, I just love happy endings.
Yes. I do, too.
Blue?!
Pink!
I know you,
I walked with you once...
Blue!
... upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions
are seldom all they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll Love me at once
The way you did once
Upon
A
Dream

Forever we'll stay
Oh!
"Felicitations to Donald Duck... on his birthday, Friday the 13th... from his friends in Latin America."
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
What a pleasant surprise.
Whoops.
Ah, now, isn't that wonderful?
Which one should I open first?
My mama told me to take... this one!
I wonder what's in it.
Oh, boy! Home movies!
Just what I wanted.
Well, well, well.
Well, doggone.
A little penguin.
Oh. What a cute little fella.
Well, what is this?
How do you open this thing, anyway?
On with the show.
The show must go on.
Sí, señor.
That means "strange birds."
Oh, sure, sure.
I know: Birds.
Yes, amigo, your feathered cousins.
You know, Donald, you have more relatives here... than there are coffee beans in Brazil.
For instance, take the one who lives way, way down...
But suppose we let my friend
Professor Holloway tell us about it.
From the beginning to...
El fin, the end.
Yes. Thank you.
Professor?
This story takes us way down to the South Pole.
Rather than have you stand on your heads... let's turn the theater over.
There. That's better.
Two things you will find most of down here... are ice and penguins.
It's amazing that anybody would want to live here... but most penguins wouldn't live anywhere else.
You couldn't find better weather for fishing... skiing, tobogganing... or swimming.
And there is nothing the average penguin likes better... than a day at the beach.
Uh, but come on.
Let's meet Pablo.
He lives down at the end of Main Street.
Let's go in and see what's cookin'.
Pablo could never remember having been warm enough... and so his closest companion was SmokeyJoe... his little stove.
Between chills,
Pablo had one burning desire... to spend the rest of his life on some tropical shore.
So we see him bravely set forth for the isle of his dreams.
The other penguins turned out to give him a big send-off.
But when he gets just so far away from his stove...
See what happens?
Too bad.
Perhaps he'll give up this wild idea.
But no.
He's off to another start.
This time he's bringing a friend.
Anyway, it was a hot idea.
Well, maybe he'll be content to stay at home this time.
But no!
There he goes... hotfooting it to the land of the sun.
By now, the farewell committee has been reduced to two.
Discouraging, isn't it?
Suddenly,
Pablo got one of those ideas... that change a person's whole life: A boat.
But where would he get a boat?
Just watch.
Where there's a will, there's a way, they say.
And now, the official launching.
Day after day, the south wind carried him north.
One day, a blanket of fog rolled in... and it was so thick...
Must be near Cape Horn.
As the fog lifted... he found himself headed straight through the Straits of Magellan... and northward along Chile's rocky coast.
One day, a storm cloud came up... just a little bitty old storm cloud, though... and just tried awful hard to have its first storm.
Didn't amount to much, though.
One day on lookout,
Pablo had a bit of a shock... a waterspout off the port bow!
But it proved to be theJuan Fernandez Islands... where Robinson Crusoe once lived... and still does, apparently.
Four bells and all's well.
According to Pablo's chart, he should be nearing Vina Del Mar.
And strangely enough, that's just where he is.
He sailed past Lima, capital of Peru... hugging the coastline with a tenacity of purpose... seldom found in a penguin.
One day his telescope picked out a city... high up on top of a mountain.
The map said it was Quito... and it was right smack on the equator.
It wasn't as easy to cross... but with a little help from Neptune, he made it.
So, making a left turn, he followed the equator... headed for the Galapagos Islands.
Ah, that good old sun.
Pablo felt that he'd never get enough of it.
Oh, he hadn't counted on this.
Things looked pretty bad.
Help! Man the pumps!
She's sprung a leak!
Pipe all hands on deck!
Do things! Get going!
Take to the lifeboats!
Abandon ship!
Unruffle the mizzenmast and man the poops!
And, well, don't just stand there.
Get going!
Swab the decks, and...
Heavens.
Look! What's that?
Just what he's been looking for.
Pablo has finally reached the isle of his dreams.
And so, as the warm tropical sun... sinks slowly in the west... we leave little Pablo, a bird in paradise... a picture of health in his new coat of tan.
He should be the happiest penguin in the world.
Only sometimes... he gets to thinking...
Never satisfied.
Well, that's human nature for you... even if you're a penguin.
You're absolutely right.
And now, Donald, let's hop over the Andes.
From these snowcapped peaks to the depths of the Amazon jungle... one finds many more strange and exotic birds.
Like the anambepreto of Colombia and Venezuela.
He carries his own bagpipes hidden under his beard.
Then there's his cousin, the arapapa... pride of Paraguay, whose perfect appearance... permits his pompous pride in his pompadour.
And la tijereta, the scissors bird... the Colombian cutup.
Then there's the arapacu de pico curvo.
He's always sticking his nose into things.
Did you ever see such a freak beak, huh?
Speaking of beaks, what a time two toucans have making love.
When they're beak to beak, they can't get cheek to cheek.
Because when one toucan turns his head... only one toucan can.
Uh-oh. Who's that?
Oh, a thousand pardons.
Señor Donald, I would like to have you meet... one of the most eccentric birds you have ever seen.
His name is the aracuan.
You'll find him most everywhere.
Eh, glad to know ya.
Pleased to meet ya.
Now, he's called the aracuan... because of the peculiar song he sings... which sounds something like this.
By the way, amigo, did you know some birds are skilled craftsmen?
Uh-uh. Is that so?
Yes. Quite a builder is the little marrequito.
His nest may look haphazard in design... ah, but every single stick and straw... is scientifically placed to withstand... the stress and strain of... well, almost anything.
Literally dotted are the shores of many tropical marshes... with the brilliant plumage of the flamingo.
And now, Donald, how would you like to hear a story... about another bird so amazing you won't believe it?
Oh, sure. You bet.
It's a tale told by an old gaucho from Uruguay.
Listen.
It was early one morning in springtime... just as day was beginning to break.
As the sun came up over the...
Oh, but I am forgetting my story.
It was silent out there on the pampas.
Only one little bird was awake.
From his nest came the little hornero to see if the...
Oh, say, do you know why this bird's called the hornero?
- No?
- Uh-uh. Why?
You see, his nest is just like the horno.
That's the oven where we bake our bread and our...
Oh, oh, oh, you know who that is?
That's me, when I was a little gauchito.
Many, many years ago, of course.
And why was I up so early?
Because I was going out hunting all alone.
First I put on my bombachas and tied on my chiripá.
Then I slipped into my new botas.
And I put my boleadoras where I could reach them in a hurry.
¡Gauchito.!
Not forgetting my hunting knife.
And now I was ready to go.
Now, the best place to hunt the wild ostrich... is out on the wide open plains... on the broad, flat land of the...
Flat land?
Say, what am I doing here?
Oh, now I remember.
This day I was hunting for condor birds high up in the mountains.
While looking around for the condors,
I climbed to the top of a rock.
No, come to think of it, it was a tree.
Let's see, maybe it was a rock after all.
Although I could swear it was a tree.
Oh, what's the difference?
Let it go. Let it go.
My sharp eyes soon discovered the nest of a...
Psst! ¡Gauchito.!
The nest.
I could tell from the wings he was... he was a least five meters from tip to tip.
The biggest condor bird in all of... ¡Caramba.!
What's this?
I couldn't believe my eyes.
No, it couldn't be.
But there it was.
I was looking face to face with a flying donkey.
The donkey bird didn't seem bashful.
He flew right up close to...
Quick, Gauchito.!
Now! Get him, quick!
Aha. Got him.
Now, now. Easy, easy.
This donkey should be worth a fortune.
I couldn't let him get away.
So I made up my mind that I'd catch him if it took me the rest of...
Now I had him!
Hold him, Gauchito.!
Ride him, cowboy!
He acted just like he was loco, but I was an expert, of course.
He thought he could throw this gauchito... but he soon found out who was the boss.
Psst, Gauchito.!
Who is the boss?
I decided to train him for racing... far out where nobody could see...
'cause I planned to win thousands of pesos... for this little burrito and me.
I made brilliant plans for the future.
We'd live like a couple of kings... and I'd be the world's richest gaucho... with my hands full of big diamond rings.
¡Ah, macanudo.!
Okay.
This burrito was tame as a kitten.
He was learning new tricks every day.
You should see how he begged for my mate.
He liked it much better than hay.
Then we soon fell asleep by the campfire.
We both were as tired as could be... and tomorrow was very important... for little Burrito and me.
For this was the day of fiesta.
The gauchos were happy and gay.
They danced the zamba and gatos... and gambled their pesos away.
While the crowd sang and danced in the plaza...
I just stood in the shade of a tree...
and watched them toss coins at the sapo.
But this game meant nothing to me.
Some others were rolling the bochas and betting on games of this kind.
But I didn't join in these pastimes.
I had something bigger in mind.
- ¡Ay, caballo.!
- The race was about to begin... and the grand prize was 1,000 pesos.
The gauchos were howling with laughter... when they saw us come out on the track.
I whispered,
"Remember the wings, Burrito."
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Not yet! Not yet!
The gauchos and horses were all on their toes.
We were off with the speed of a bullet.
We flew down the track like the wind.
Every gaucho was, uh, uh...
Meanwhile, Burrito and I were, uh, uh, jockeying for position.
¡Gauchito.!
They went that way.
That way.
No wonder they laughed.
I didn't even look like a jockey.
Hey, Gauchito.
Come on.
Look like a jockey.
Pepito, the pride of Mendoza, was setting a furious pace... and Fuego, Gordito and Pingo, you never have seen such a race.
Now it's Pepito and Fuego.
It's Fuego and Pepito.
And there comes Gordito on the rail.
Do your stuff, kid.
No?
Well, don't wait too long or...
Look out!
Ah-heh.
What did I tell you?
Come on, Gauchito.
The wings, the wings.
Quickly I untied the rope.
Come on, come on.
Quickly I untied the rope.
The knife! The knife!
¡Córtalo, córtalo.!
And now we go.
You should see little Burrito... tearing up the track, so fast you couldn't see us.
And now down the home stretch comes
Fuego. Now Pepito's ahead on the rail.
Here comes Pingo, Gordito and Gato, and Dorado is right on his tail.
But where is Burrito?
Here comes Burrito!
We passed them like they were standing still.
And now coming down across the line of finish, it's Burrito, the winner!
Well, amigos, it was all over but the shouting...
I thought.
Caramba.
The jig was up.
And what became of the flying donkey, you ask?
Neither him nor me was ever seen again... as long as we lived.
Adios, amigo.
Adios. So long!
Good-bye!
What's going on here?
Presents! Oh, boy!
Let me at 'em!
Say, what's this?
Ah, Pato Donald.
Or, as you Americans say, what's cookin'?
Joe Carioca!
Well, I'll be doggoned!
Imagine meeting me here.
Donald, have you ever been to Baía? No?
- No, I haven't.
- Ah, Baía.
Land of romance... moonlight, music, beautiful girls.
Oh, forgive the interruption,
Donald.
This crazy bird is the aracuan.
He's meio maluco, a very stupid fellow.
But tell me, Donald, have you ever been to Baía?
- No, I haven't.
- No? Oh...
I am so sorry for you.
Ah, Baía.
It is like a song in my heart.
A song with love... and beautiful memories.
I close my eyes, and I can see it now.
I can see the beautiful twilight in the sky.
I can feel the breeze from the bay... and I can hear the music, the music of Baía.
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you
Calls to you
I live in the memory of
Many dreams ago
When the stars were bright
And you were mine alone
My love for you cannot die
Though the oceans run dry
Or heaven falls from the sky
Now you're gone
Can't you hear my lonely call
Morena
Make my life complete again
How I pray for the day
When I'll see your smile
And my heart will beat again
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you, calls to you
Ah, Baía.
Beautiful Baía.
Oh, forgive me, but have you been to Baía, Donald?
- No.
- No? Well, let's go.
If you go to Baía, my friend... you'll never return.
Have you been to Baía, Donald
- Uh-uh.
- Well, let's go
- They have vatapá
- What's that?
- They have caruru
- Is that so?
- They have munguzá
- Munguzá?
- Do you like to samba
- Oh, sure.
- Have you been to Baía, Donald
- No.
Well, let's go
When you go to Baía, my friend
You'll never return
Have you been to Baía?
- No.
- No? Well, let's go!
Hurry, Donald! Hurry!
Well, well. Here we are in Baía, land of romance.
Baía? Where is Baía?
We are in Baía.
Look.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
- Who's that?
- Donald, that's Yayá.
- Who's Yayá?
- Ah, a baiana.
Donald, quindins de Yayá.
She sells cookies.
Cookies, my friend.
Donald!
- Hello.
- i Como vai!
Hi, toots.
What?
- Who is that guy?
- Oh, he's a malandro, Donald.
Oh, boy!
This Donald!
Did you ever see such a fast worker?
No, no, Donald.
Take it easy.
Look.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Come on, boys.
What do you feel about Baía, huh?
Tell me the truth.
Oh, swell! Marvelous!
Romance.
Moonlight.
Beautiful girls.
Or as you say, you are a wolf.
Take it easy.
You have more presents.
Presents?
Whee! Presents!
What? Oh! Oh!
Oh, I'm a midget!
Oh!
You, you're a midget too!
Oh-ho, Donald!
Don't worry.
It is simple, my friend.
Just a little black magic will fix you up.
Believe it or not, it is very simple!
You are very funny fellow!
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my!
You kill my head!
- Huh?
- Oh, my friend... you are using the wrong finger.
Now, blow!
- Thanks, pal!
- B-B-B-But, Donald, your presents!
My presents!
Aha, my friends!
Welcome to Mexico.
Son of a gun, it's a pleasure to see such fine gentlemen in Mexico.
Here, amigos.
Donald!
José.
¡Caramba.!
Now we're three gay caballeros.
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos
No matter where he goes
The one, two and three goes
We're always together
We're three happy chappies with snappy serapes
You'll find us beneath our sombreros
We're brave and we'll stay so
We're bright as a peso
- Who says so?
- We say so
The Three Caballeros
We have the stars to guide us
Guitars here beside us
To play as we go
We sing and we samba
We shout, Ay, caramba
- What means "ay, caramba"?
- Oh, yes. I don't know.
Through fair or stormy weather
We stand close together
Like books on a shelf
And pals though we may be
When some Latin baby says yes, no, or maybe
Each man is for himself
- What's this?
- What's this?
This is your gift from Mexico, Donald:
A piñata.
Oh, boy, oh, boy! A piñata!
What's a piñata?
A piñata is full of surprises, presents.
It is the very spirit of Christmas.
Christmas?
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all...
No, no, Donald.
For goodness sake.
Not "Jingly Bells."
In Mexico, they sing
"Las Posadas."
This custom takes place on each of the nine days before Christmas.
Each evening, the children gather at the village church... and form a procession symbolizing the journey of Mary and Joseph... from Nazareth to Bethlehem.
The little ones carry images of the saints from house to house...
singing a plea for shelter, or posada.
A reply comes from within:
"No posada. No shelter."
Looking sad and downhearted, they try again... but the reply is still the same.
"No shelter. No posada."
They repeat this song time after time... and always they are refused.
Until at last they reach a friendly house and the door is opened.
"Come in, come in, holy pilgrims.
This humble home is yours."
And now, Mary and Joseph have found shelter at last.
Then the rejoicing begins... the feasting, the celebrating... and finally the biggest surprise of all:
Breaking the piñata.
And now for your piñata, Donald.
Here you are.
Go to it.
One side, boys. One side.
I'm gonna smack it!
Uh-uh, no, hold it.
Ho-Hold it, Donald.
First you must be blindfolded.
We have to put this over your eyes.
That's part of the tradition.
Now, now, now, stand here.
Come here now.
Hit it hard.
All right, let's see you smack it.
Just a minute.
Uh-oh. Aha!
You see, Donald? Didn't I told you it was full of surprises?
Did you know that the history of Mexico is in her flag?
Oh, yes! You see, many hundreds of years ago, the god of the Aztecs... commanded them to build a big city where they would find an eagle destroying a serpent.
But when they find this eagle, he was sitting on a cactus on top of a rock... way out in the middle of a lake.
¡Caramba.! To build a city here would be almost imposible.
But they built and built and built some more... until today, believe it or not, the lake is full of Mexico City.
Sweet music
Gay serenatas
Tropic skies
Of velvet blue
Magic gardens
Perfume the breezes
Where true love
Brought me to you
Mexico
With all your romance
Your song oflove
Will live forever after
Mexico
Sweethearts are singing
Lovebirds are winging
Through a sky filled with laughter
Paradise
That's where I found you
Your magic smile
Made the blossoms bloom around you
Mexico
Why do I feel as I do
I simply fell
Under the spell
Of you
- ¡Oba.! ¡Oba.! Nice! Oh, boy!
- Wow!
Ah, but this is only the beginning, amigos. Take a look at this one.
Oh, boy!
What a pretty picture!
And now, for a nice little trip through Mexico... on the magic serape.
- All aboard, amigos.
- Oh, what's goin' on here?
Paradise
That's where I found you
Your magic smile
Made the blossoms bloom around you
Mexico
Why do I feel as I do
I simply fell
Under the spell
Of you
Of you
And this, Donald, is Patzcuaro... a fisherman's paradise.
Yeah! Beautiful!
Oh, boy! Would I like to come back sometime... and do a little fishing.
Uh-oh!
- What's going on here?
- Shh!
This is my favorite dance, the "jarabe pateño."
Doggone it!
I can't get it.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, boys!
You are off the beat.
This is the way.
Well, what do you know?
Thanks.
I had a wonderful time.
So long!
This is the way they dance in Veracruz.
It's called the "lilongo."
Hi, girls!
May I cut in?
Watch your step, Donald!
Some fun, hey, kid?
So you like dancing, huh?
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go on, Donald.
Don't be afraid.
Not so fast, boys.
Go on in, Donald.
Don't be bashful.
Hi, toots!
Am I intruding?
Hey, Donald, you are what they say, off the cob!
- You know, corny.
- Oh, yeah?
Swing me with that boogie beat, Joe!
How am I doin', toots?
Come on, let me down.
- I wanna stay!
- Take it easy, Donald.
There she is...
Acapulco Beach... the Riviera of Mexico.
Take the telescope and have a look at what you might call the hot stuff.
Oh, boy! Am I going to like this place.
Oh, boy! Hot stuff!
I'll be right down, toots.
- Hello, my sweet little bathing beauties.
- Donald! Donald!
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
Where's Donald?
Aha! I am a son of a gun. Look at the little wolf in duck's clothings.
Come to Papa.
Wha-What's going on here?
Come here, you little rascals.
Now I've got ya. Uh-oh.
Doggone this confusion!
Oops! Where is she?
Come here, my little enchilada.
I've got you this time, tootsie.
Peek-a-boo.
I see you.
Hey, where am I?
My, my, my!
Ain't this fun?
Here I come!
This time I'm gonna get you!
Oh, no, no, no, Donald!
Don't do that!
Let me go. Get me outta here!
You can't do this to me.
Get your hands off of me!
This is a free country.
Bye-bye!
So you like pretty girls, huh?
Let's go!
- Let me go!
- Don't ruffle your feathers, Donald!
Look, I will show you the nightlife of Mexico City.
- Beautiful, no?
- Colossal!
Oh, boy! Mexico City?
Very beautiful city.
Careful, Donald.
Even the sky is full of romantic!
You belong to my heart
- She's beautiful!
- Now and forever
- And our love had its start
- Oh, boy!
Not long ago
We were gathering stars
While a million guitars played our love song
When I said "I love you" every beat of my heart
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Said it too
'Twas a moment like this
Do you remember
And your eyes threw a kiss
When they met mine
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
'Twas a moment like this
- Do you remember
- Uh-huh.
And your eyes threw a kiss
- When they met mine
- Don't do that!
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
You belong
To my heart
Now and forever
Three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
Three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
When I said "I love you"
Every beat of my heart said it too
- Some fun, hey, kid?

Some fun, hey, kid?
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos
No matter where he goes
The one, two and three goes
We're always together
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.
What? Oh, boy!
Uh-oh.
Uh, what's happening, anyway?
Where am I?
Uh-oh!
My, my!
Uh-oh.
What?
What?
What?
Come on, torito, give it to me!
What's the matter with you?
Are you color-blind?
Come on, bull. You bashful?
Oh, through fair or stormy weather
We're always together

The economic and social council will convene in five minutes.
G-Good day, sir.
G-Good day, Mr. Ambassador.
How do you do, madam?
Order. Order.
This emergency meeting... of the International Rescue Aid Society is now in session.
Delegates, you have been summoned from all corners of the globe... because we have reason to believe that someone is in distress.
As you know, our society has never failed to answer a call for help.

We will face the portrait of the beloved founder of our society, Euripides Mouse.

Mr. Bernard, if you please.
C-C-Coming through.
Uh, pardon me.
Have a care there.
I'm, uh-- I'm sorry.
Uh-- Excuse me, sir.
- Oops.
- Egad!
Delegates, this is no time for levity.
Serious business, you know.
Serious business.
Now what?
Sir, there, uh-- there-- there are
1 3 steps on this ladder.
Oh, superstitious nonsense.
What next?
Oh, um, sorry, sir.
I'll, uh-- I'll have it-- have it out in-in a jiffy, sir.
''To Morningside Orphanage, New York.''
It's difficult to decipher.
I can't make it out.
''I am... in terrible... terrible trouble.''
Oh, oh, dear, it's all watered out.
''Hurry.
Help. Penny.''
Penny?
Morningside Orphanage?
Dash it all.
It's not much to go on, is it?
Oh. Oh, that poor little girl.
Oh, Mr. Chairman, please... please, may I have this assignment?
You, Miss Bianca?
Dear lady, it's absolutely without precedent.
I mean, it's not like the old days when it was a man's world.
However, I suppose there has to be a first time.
Uh, uh, Mr. Chairman, sir.
I-I-I don't think Miss Bianca should go. It could be dangerous.
I mean, I mean, any-- anything could-- could happen to her.
You see, dear lady, before our janitor interrupted...
I was about to suggest that you should have a co-agent go with you.
Gentlemen, who will volunteer?
Gentlemen, this is indeed a-- a most difficult decision to make.
I choose...
Mr. Bernard to be my co-agent.
M-Me? Oh, th-that's-- that's really very, uh--
No, uh, see, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a-- I'm only a-a-a ja-janitor.
Oh, come on.
We'll be a great team together.
Oh, come on!
Bravo! Bravo!
Ajanitor, my lady?
Oh, good heavens. Bless my soul.
Morningside Orphanage.
Here. H-Here it is.
Three blocks down and... uh, uh, four blocks over.
Well, why don't we take the shortcut through the zoo?
Uh, gee, uh, Miss Bianca, uh--
I-I don't know. I mean, it's-- you know, it could be risky.
Oh, come on.
Remember our pledge?
Through storm and rain and dark of night--
Never fail to do what's right.
All right, duty calls.
Uh, Mr. Bernard, um, maybe we'd better go back.
It's so dark in there.
Dark?
Who's a--
Who's afraid of the dark?
Look, you, uh--y-you stay here.
I'll-- I'll check it out.
Wait for me!
How-- How about trying, uh, three blocks down and, uh, four blocks over?
What did you do to make him so mad?
Nothing. He's just a-- just a grumpy old lion.
Well, after all, waking him up in the middle of the night--
Wouldn't you be grumpy too?
I didn't wake him up in the middle of the night.
I was walking through the thing, and he just--
I'll, uh-- I'll take a look around, see what I can find.
Miss, uh-- Miss Bianca, over here.
I-I found something.
- These are Penny's belongings.
- Good work.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Oh, look.
The little girl's treasures.
Boy, the things kids collect.
Do you think she could be still here in the orphanage?
Well, s-she can't be. It says on the box, ''Hold until further notice.''
Well, maybe she's been adopted.
No, because she would've taken these things with her.
- Mice!
- Cat!
Now, lookee here, you two... if folks find out that mice moved in here...
I-I'll get kicked out, lose my job.
Oh, d-don't worry, Mr. Cat.
We won't be here long.
I'm a mite too old to be chasin' mice.
Uh, sir, could-- could you tell us what happened to a little girl named Penny?
I sure can. But you ain't gonna find her around here.
The poor little thing ran away.
When-- When was the last time you saw Penny?
Was there anything unusual?
Try to remember.
Let's see now. Uh--
The last time I saw her... she was sittin' over there on her bed, all alone.
She looked awful sad, and so I asked her--
What's wrong, Penny honey?
Nothing.
Oh, come on, now.
Come on. No secrets.
You tell old Rufus, huh?
Well, it was adoption day at the orphanage.
Well, what happened?
A man and a lady came and looked at me... but they choosed a little redheaded girl.
She was prettier than me.
Oh! Sh-She couldn't be!
Y-You listen to me, darlin'.
You're something extra special.
No, I'm not.
Why, someday a mama and a papa will come to the orphanage... looking for a pretty little girl just like you.
- Honest?
- I'll bet my whiskers on it.
But you've got to believe it.
Keep the faith, sweetheart.
- Do you see that bluebird?
- Yes, I do.
Well, faith is a bluebird... you see from afar.
It's for real, and as sure as the first evening star.
You can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same... making things turn out right.
Can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same, making things turn out right.
But whoever adopts me has to adopt Teddy too.
Oh, they'll love him.
He doesn't eat much, does he?
Oh, here!
I brought you something.
Land o' Goshen! Catnip snaps!
No! They're ginger snaps!
Well, an old codger like me could use a little ginger.
I taked two extra ones for lunch today.
We're not supposed to do that.
Well, you can trust me.
I won't tattletale on you.
I love you, Rufus.
Gee, we'd better hurry, or we'll be late for supper!
She seemed happy enough, but the next thing I heard...
Penny was gone.
Well, aren't-- aren't the police still looking for her?
No, no, no, no.
They-- They gave up weeks ago.
Oh, this is terrible.
That poor little girl.
I just can't believe that Penny would run away.
Uh, Mr. Rufus, please think.
Now, there must be something else.
Well, come to think of it, there was.
Oh, no, no, it's-- it's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.
Get in what? W-With who?
Oh, a weird lady tried to give Penny a ride... but she wouldn't have anything to do with trashy people like them.
Trashy people? Who?
She and her partner run a sleazy pawn shop down the street.
Miss Bianca, we must go down there and investigate.
Suit yourself, but you'd be wasting your time going down there.
She could be in real trouble.
We gotta find her and help her.
Yeah, but two little mice.
What-- What can you do?
Bernard, uh, a child's book!
It's Penny's!
Then, uh--
Then she's gotta be here.
W-What's so funny?
Y-Your tail!
Here, here, let me help you fix it.
Who could be ringing at this time of night?
Madame Medusa's
Pawn Shop Boutique.
- Hello, boss.
- Snoops!
Don't tell me, Snoops.
Let me guess. You found it!
You've found the diamond!
Give you time?
You bungler!
You have been down there for three months.
Bottles? What bottles?
You caught Penny sending messages in bottles?
You blundering fool!
Can't you control a little girl?
Shut up! I am taking the next flight down to Devil's Bayou!
This is terrible.
We've got to go with her.
Yeah, come on.
In the suitcase.
Bumbling boob.
He fouls up everything.
Leave him for a few weeks and--
Oh, why won't this stupid thing close?
Out of my way, you road hog!
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4.
Hurry-- Hurry, Miss Bianca! Medusa could be down at the Devil's Bayou by now.
Oh, I'm sorry, but-- but a lady does have to pack a few things, you know.
Will Mr.Jenkins report to the ticket counter, please?
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4, now departing.
Flight leaves 6:45.
Oh, no, we missed the flight.
- Miss Bianca, if you hadn't--
- You worry too much.
You know that flights are always late.
Albatross Flight 1 3 to Tower.
Albatross 1 3.
Now, what did I tell you?
We are lucky, Mr. Bernard.
Luck? Flight 1 3?
Maybe we'd better take the train.
Wake up.!
Dad-rad it.! Somebody answer down there.!
Get off the dime.!
Hello.! Hello.!
Is there anybody down there?
Uh, h-h-hello?
Where have you been, oh,you lazy knucklehead?
W-We-We just got here, sir.
Uh, uh, see, my co-agent insisted on packing her, uh--
Look, bud, am I clear to land?
Traffc up here is thicker than fleas on a hound dog's--
Wo-Wow.! Dad-blast,you dirty road hog-- road hog-- Crazy--
Look-- One at a time--
You stupid, lunkheaded--
- Uh, what did he say, Mr. Bernard?
- I wouldn't dare repeat it.
Well, then give him the permission to land.
Uh, Captain, you, uh-- you have our permission to land.
- Well, it's about time, bud.!
- Look! Look! There he is!
Doesn't he fly beautifully?
And you wanted to take the train, you 'fraidy cat.
'Fraidy cat?
It's just that, uh--
No, I-I like trains.
I mean, they serve, uh, Roquefort, uh--
Pull up! Pull up!
Are-- Are--
Are you hurt, sir?
Nope.
One of my better landings, bud.
Oh, great.
Come on. We're--
We're gonna take the train.
Play it safe.
Train? Safe?
Listen here, buster.
-I'm as fit as a fiddle.
-And you look simply wonderful, Captain.
Oh, shucks,just call me Orville, little lady.
All right, all right, uh, it's most important we get to Devil's Bayou.
Well, now, will you just keep your shirt on?
Flight 1 3 hits the wild blue yonder in five minutes.
Eight, nine, ten, eleven... twelve-- Oh, no.
There are 1 3 steps on this ramp.
Well, why don't you jump the last one?
This is your captain speaking.
Welcome aboard, folks.
Fasten your seat belts. No smoking.
Just sit back and leave the driving to me.
Miss Bianca, be sure it's fastened good and tight.
I can't.
It'll wrinkle my dress.
Say, bud, read the checklist to me.
Uh, oh, yeah.
Goggles down.
- Check.
- Wing flaps down.
- Check.
- Tail feathers.
- Double check.
''If at first you don't succeed... try, try again.''
And here we go!
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.
Oh, I just love takeoffs!
Captain, you fly beautifully.
It's just like being on a ''roller scoater.''
- He just went through a red light.
- Oh, I do that all the time, darling.
Now, come on.
Stop worrying.
Come along
Will there be sunshine shinin'
Will we find a silver linin'
Come along
Sing a song
When today becomes tomorrow
Will we findjoy or sorrow
Sing a song
Is it wrong
To put all our hopes together
And wish for somethin'better
Is it wrong
To be loved
To face the future with another
Who means more than any other
Is to be loved
We'll paint the grey clouds
With pretty rainbow hues
And we'll brush the gloom away
And save it for a rainy day
Rainy day
Oh, today
If troubles cast a shadow
And shadows make the sun afraid to stay
Why, it's okay
'Cause there'll be sunshine shinin'
And we'll find the silver linin'
Another day
Uh, listen to this.
It says here Devil's Bayou is uncharted and hazardous.
Each day's operations...
Hmm, interesting. must be...
Good night, dear. planned with... care and--
Tomorrow is another day
Good night, Bianca.
How I hope you'll always stay
Penny!
Penny?
Penny, answer me!
Penny?
Snoops!
Snoops, get down here!
W-W-What's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
That little brat has escaped again.
Nero, Brutus, bring her back, boys.
Why won't it start?
Snoops! What's wrong?
W-W-What's wro-- I don't-- I don't know.
It was working good yesterday.
Oh, shut up!
Send up flares!
Light up the swamp so I can find her!
Well, folks, we'll be landing at Devil's Bayou in just a minute.
Your crew thanks you for flying Albatross Air--
What in the--
Sufferin' sassafras!
My rudder's on fire!
Bail out! Bail out!
Help!
Bernard!
Mayday! Mayday!
Sufferin' catfish!
What on earth?
Luke! Luke, wake up!
Luke, get down here!
It's Orville!
Oh, that Orville.
No, Luke, no. He's in trouble!
You get down here right now!
I'm a-comin'.
Wow-wee!
This new batch really packs a wallop!
Look out below!
Oh, what a shame.
Here, honey, let me help you.
Say, cousin, you look like you could use a swig of this.
It's good for what ails ya.
There.
Where are you folks from, anyway?
We're--
We're from New Y-- New York.
Now, stand back, folks. I ain't gonna hang around this creepy place long.
Clear the runway!
Great balls of fire!
Holy smoke!
Why don't you watch where you're goin'!
Bernard, it's that terrible Medusa.
I'd like to give her a few whacks with my rollin' pin.
We swamp folks would like to run her clean out of our bayou.
Hold it. Hold it!
Somebody's comin' this way.
Why did you have to go and spoil everything?
Nero, don't you dare get my teddy bear wet.
Oh, it's that poor little young 'un.
She's tryin' to run away again.
It's Penny.
Oh, how terrible.
Hurry! We've got to find out where they're taking her!
You'll need a boat. Evinrude's got the fastest boat around here.
Evinrude, wake up!
Start up your engine, boy!
Send Evinrude back as soon as you need help.
I'll round up the neighbors!
Faster!
Evinrude, faster!
You stop that, Brutus.
This fog is awful.
You can't see a thing.
Sl-Slow down, Evinrude.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
Oh, dear! We've lost them!
Jehoshaphat!
Hang on!
Hard to port, Evinrude!
Help me, Bernard!
Help! Bernard!
Bianca!
C-Come on, Evinrude.
Give it all you've got.
Keep trying, Evinrude.
Poor Evinrude.
Your carburettor is all pooped out.
Bring her right on in, boys.
Come on.
So, you tried to run away.
Well, it didn't work, did it? Huh?
Put me down, Brutus!
Cranky old dragon.
Nice work. Good boys.
W-W-Wait, boys. Steady, boy.
D-D-Down, boys. Heel. Heel!
There, there, Teddy.
I won't let them do that to you again. Don't cry.
Oh, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.
Poor Teddy.
All she ever thinks about is that simple bear.
Now, you behave, or I'll let Nero and Brutus have your old teddy bear.
You will not!
Besides, I'm not scared of'em... like you are, Mr. Snoops.
Oh, don't you sass me.
Ah, uh, boys, take this naughty little girl to her room.
I can go by myself, thank you.
Stick around, Evinrude.
We'll-- We'll signal if we need you.
Look out! Here she comes!
Where is she? Where is she?
Ah, eh, w-where is she?
Oh, I-I sent her up to her room.
Why did you let her escape?
What is your alibi this time, nitwit?
Nitwit?
Well, don't blame me, Medusa.
Those leather-headed lizards of yours, they're supposed to be patrolling the island.
They let her get away.
Ha! My precious pets.
We know who caught that ungrateful little brat, don't we, hmm?
It was your brilliant idea to use the little girl for this caper.
- If you'd left it to me--
- Snoops, you're not thinking.
I know, I know. She's the only one small enough to squeeze down the black hole.
Yes, but why can't she find my big diamond?
I don't know, but-- but just look at these beauties that she brought up from the cave.
Oh, they'll sell for a lot of cold cash.
Ow!
I wish you wouldn't do that.
She's insane. Utterly mad.
I want that diamond.
I've got to have the Devil's Eye!
You didn't leave the girl down in the cave long enough.
She won't take orders.
You are too soft.
But the water was rising and the tide was coming in... and all she did down there was fuss about her teddy bear getting wet.
Snoops, you don't have a way with children.
You must gain their confidence... make them like you.
Yeah? How do you do that?
You force them to like you, idiot!
At the next low tide...
I am going to put her down there myself... and keep her there... until she finds it.
And it is as simple as that.
Oh, it's as simple as that, is it?
Well, you're the boss, uh, boss.
Yes.
Now come along, petsy-poos.
We gotta get Penny out of here tonight.
-Uh-oh. Bianca, they smell your perfume.
-Oh, dear.
- Oh, no!
- Mis Bianca!
Let go, you-you-you, you big bullies, you!
Brutus! Nero!
Stop that infernal racket!
I mean now!
Snoops! Snoops, a mouse!
Oh, kill it, kill it!
Oh, Snoops, kill it!
Look! There's another one!
Oh, what is wrong with this thing?
Snoops! What's wrong?
I don't--
E-E-Evinrude, over here!
Are you--
Are you all right, dear?
Why, she-- she tried to kill us.
That-- That-- That terrible woman!
Oh, if I was only a ten-foot mouse,
I'd show her.
It's-- It's no use, Bianca.
Maybe Rufus the cat was right.
Wh-What can two little mice do?
R-E-S-C-U-E
Rescue Aid Society
But, Bernard, the Society's counting on us.
We can't quit now.
Oh, and that little girl.
We've just got to rescue her.
Rescue Aid Society
Heads held high
Penny dear!
Auntie Medusa wants to talk to you!
High tide or not... that little brat is going to find me that diamond... tomorrow... or else!
Come in. Come in.
Did you want to see me, ma'am?
Why, yes, my dear.
Don't be so shy.
Now, I am going to let bygones be bygones.
Do you know what would make
Auntie Medusa very happy?
Yes, you want me to find that diamond.
That's right, dear!
But I've tried hard as I could, honest.
Of course you have.
But we must try harder, mustn't we?
Then please will you take me back to the orphanage like you promised?
Penny, don't you like it here?
A big, beautiful boat all to yourself.
But if I don't get back to the orphanage...
I'll never get 'dopted.
Adopted?
What makes you think anyone would want... a homely little girl like you?
Be brave, little one
Make a wish
For each sad little tear
Hold your head up
Though no one is near
Someone's waiting for you
Don't cry, little one
There'll be a smile
Where a frown used to be
You'll be part of the love that you see
Someone's waiting for you
Always keep a little prayer
In your pocket
And you're sure to see the light
Soon there'll bejoy and happiness
And your little world
Will be bright
Have faith, little one
Till your hopes and your wishes come true
You must try to be brave
Little one
Someone's waiting
To love
You
Good night, Teddy.
Sleep tight.
Oh, we almost forgot to say our prayers.
Please bless Rufus and Teddy... and all the kids at the orphanage--
Jennifer, Bobby, Mary,Julie.
And please let someone find my bottle.
There's a message in it.
Because running away isn't working. Amen.
Don't worry, Teddy. We'll--
We'll be all right.
Penny. Penny.
Yes?
Penny-- Penny, dear, now don't cry.
We are here to help you.
We-- Hi!
Where'd you come from?
We found the bottle with-- with your message, and we've come to rescue you.
Did you hear that, Teddy?
Our bottle worked!
Didn't you bring somebody big with you... like the police?
Uh, no, there's-- there's just the-- the two of us.
But if the three of us work together, and we have a little faith--
That's what Rufus said.
Faith makes things turn out right.
Penny, I know it's late, but we have to escape tonight, right now.
But I just got caught by Brutus and Nero.
Look what they did to my pants.
Yeah, and they're-- they're still down there guarding the gangplank.
Oh, those vicious monsters.
They ought to be locked up in a cage.
I know, I know.
Come on. I'll show you.
See there? The elevator.
Oh, it's a perfect cage, Penny.
Great idea.
Now, uh, wha-wha-- what can we use for bait?
Oh, they'll eat anything.
- Yeah, I know.
- I've got it.
My perfume. Remember? They'll follow the scent right into the elevator.
And I'll slam the door.
And would that make Medusa mad.
Brutus! Nero!
Did you let that little brat escape again?
You're too soft.
Hey, Penny, that's not bad.
That's exactly like Medusa.
Track her down, boys.
Bring her back.
And we'll be so far ahead, they'll never catch us.
Wait a minute. She-- She might catch us in-- in her swamp-mobile.
We'll swipe it.
I've always wanted to drive it.
Wh-What if Medusa wakes up wh-wh-while we're starting it?
W-We're in trouble.
We-We've gotta stall 'em somehow.
How 'bout Mr. Snoop's fireworks?
We'll shoot 'em off in her bedroom.
That will keep her busy.
Oh, Bernard, it's so exciting.
Perfume, crocs, swamp-mobiles.
It's just got to work.
It's our only chance.
But-- But we're gonna need help.
Snoops! Snoops, get down here!
Uh, w-what's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
Oh, shut up!
High tide or not--
I bet those two are up to something.
Gee, I don't wanna go down that awful black hole again.
Don't worry about that, dear.
You must hurry and get dressed.
Come on.
We haven't got much time.
E-Evinrude? Uh, up here.
W-We need help.
G-Go get Ellie Mae.
An-And hurry!
Ya-hoo!
Are you ready to help rescue that little young 'un?
- Sure enough, Ellie Mae.
- Hallelujah!
Luke! On your feet, you lazy critter!
Shucks, Ellie Mae. I was just a-waitin' for someone to holler ''charge''!
Dagnab it. Let's cut out the jawin' and get a-goin'!
When old Gramps gets ''het'' up, his nose gets plumb out of joint.
Take it easy, Gramps.
We gotta stay here till Evinrude brings us word from them mice.
If'n that bug don't get here soon... they'll put that poor little girl down the black hole again.
All right, you little brat. Now, you are gonna go down in that hole... and you are gonna dig till you find me the diamond.
You understand that?
And no sassing me.
Uh-uh-uh. Snoops, that is no way to speak... to our little Miss Penny.
What? Oh.
Okay, boss, okay.
Now, my dear... you are going to find the big, shiny diamond... for your Auntie Medusa.
Aren't you?
Teddy doesn't like it down there.
He's afraid.
Aren't you, Teddy?
Ah. Poor Teddy.
I'll just keep him up here with me, where he'll be safe.
Give me back my teddy bear!
He's mine! He's mine!
You get down there and find the big diamond... or you will never see that Teddy again!
All right, all right.
I'll go.
Boss, you've really got a way with kids.
Don't worry, Teddy.
I won't be gone long.
I'll find her old diamond.
Oh, what a dreadful, frightening place.
Yeah, it used to be a pirates' cave.
How do you know that, Penny?
- Him.
- Ah! Oh, dear!
Come on, girls. Let's-- Let's look for that diamond so we can get out of here.
Oh, I looked there already.
Medusa doesn't want those little ones.
What-- What's--
What's-- What's-- What's that?
That's where the water comes in.
I'm afraid to go over there.
Well, if I was a pirate... that's just where I'd hide the Devil's Eye.
I'll, uh-- I'll--
I'll go over and check it out.
Uh, come-- c-come to think of it... if I was a pirate, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't hide anything back there.
Bernard, look!
I can see something.
Come on.
- Come on. Let's see what it is.
- No, no, Bianca.
You-- You stay here.
I'll see if I can find a safe way over.
- Bianca!
- Oh! Hang on!
- Help!
- I'm coming!
- What are you doing down there?
- I'm looking.
Well, look faster.
Wow!
P-Penny, hold-- hold your lantern up again.
- Holy mackerel. That-- That's it.
- The Devil's Eye.
Penny, we found it!
We found it!
Medusa, I found it!
Let me look.
Let me look, Medusa!
Back! Ah, good girl.
Good girl, good girl!
Let's get it up here.
Look, it won't go through.
I can't get it out.
- What's taking so long?
- It's stuck tight.
Stuck tight?
You get that diamond, or you'll never see daylight again!
No, no, back! Back, Penny!
Oh, Penny, you'll fall!
For-- Forget the-- the diamond.
Let's get out of here before we drown.
The water's coming in.
Please pull me up.
Not until you get the diamond.
Penny, the-- the pirate sword.
Use-- Use the sword.
Penny! Penny, help!
I've got it! I've got it!
Hurry! P-Pull me up!
Faster, Snoops. Faster.
Pulling as fast as I can.
At last!
The Devil's Eye!
It's worth millions!
Just look at it.
Filled with power... for its owner.
Let me-- Let me look at it.
I can't--
Hey, that wasn't a very good look.
But I know that there's enough there to cut it into two equal shares.
You idiot!
Cut up a perfect gem?
And it's mine. It's all mine.
All yours? Half of it is mine, you double-crossing crook!
- Put me down, Brutus!
- It's mine! It's all mine!
- Double-crosser!
- Cheap pickpocket.
- Chiseler!
- Cheap crook!
Land's sakes!
It's Evinrude!
Oh, well, sure is a mess.
Where in tarnation you been, boy?
- What's happening?
- Do they want us now?
- Well, where are they?
- They're on the boat?
- Speak up, boy.
- Buck up! We mustn't be quitting now, must we?
Stand back!
Give poor Evinrude some air!
He's plumb tuckered out.
Here, son, this'll make a new bug out of you.
Charge! Ya-hoo!
We're gonna have us a rip-snortin' fight.
Yee-hoo! Charge!
Where'd everybody go?
I don't need any help from anybody!
Charge! Ya-hoo!
Welsher! Swindler! Chiseler!
Shut up, Snoops, and don't move.
If either of you try to follow me... you'll get blasted!
You give me my teddy bear.
You promised.
Teddy goes with me, my dear.
I've become quite attached... to him.
My diamond!
My diamond!
Charge!
Now!
Now! Now!
Look out!
Oh, please start.
Advance the spark.
Not the horn, the spark lever.
Digger, hold this.
It's that doohickey on the steering wheel.
You-- You... and your infernal fireworks!
You-- You--
Oh, you dunderhead!
We're not getting any gas.
Fill her up, Luke.
Hurry. All of it!
Look out! The riverboat!
- We did it, Bianca!
- Hooray! Oh, Bernard!
Bernard, you're wonderful!
- We did it!
- We got her!
We sure showed that Medusa!
There goes... my diamond!
And because of a courageous little girl named Penny... the world's largest diamond, the Devil's Eye... is now in the Smithsonian Institute.
But what's even more important, folks... this little orphan's dream has come true.
Today she's being adopted.
-And here she is with her new mother and father.
- For she's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
From Morningside Orphanage
She's got a new mom and dad
Hooray for her mom and dad
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Bernard, I am so happy for Penny.
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Yeah, so y-you might say that...
- that Penny, uh, brought us together.
- From Morningside Orphanage
You are a darling.
Penny,you were a brave little girl to do what you did all by yourself.
Oh, I didn't do it all by myself.
Two little mice from the Rescue Aid Society helped me.
Mice? Rescue Aid Society?
Yes, they rescued me.
Uh, could I say hello to them?
Hello, Bianca.!
Hi, Bernard.!
You can talk to these little mice?
All the time.
Mice can talk like anybody.
Didn't you know that?
Well, uh, I didn't, but I do now, Penny.
Evinrude, what are you doing here?
It's another call for help.
Here, uh, uh... you're gonna need some volunteers.
But-- B-But, B-Bianca, we just--
Oh, Bernard, adventure, thrills... intrigue, travel, exotic places.
Oh, come on, darling. Let's go.
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.
Tomorrow is another day
How I hope you'll always stay
Tomorrow is another day
Long ago, the great Frith made the world.
He made all the stars...
and the world lived among the stars.
Frith made all the animals and birds...
and, at first, made them all the same.
Now, among the animals was El-ahrairah,
the Prince of Rabbits.
He had many friends...
and they all ate grass together.
After a time,
the rabbits wandered everywhere...
multiplying and eating as they went.
Then, Frith said to El-ahrairah:
"Prince Rabbit, if you cannot
control your people...
"I shall find ways to control them."
El-ahrairah would not listen,
and said to Frith:
"My people are the strongest
in the world."
This angered Frith, so he determined
to get the better of El-ahrairah.
He gave a present
to every animal and bird...
making each one different from the rest.
When the fox came,
and others like the dog and cat...
the hawk and weasel...
to them, Frith gave a desire to hunt
and slay the children of El-ahrairah.
El-ahrairah knew that Frith was
too clever for him, and he was frightened.
He had never before seen
the Black Rabbit of Death.
"My friend," said Frith,
"have you seen El-ahrairah?
"For I wish to give him a gift."
"No, I have not seen him."
So, Frith said,
"Come out, and I will bless you instead."
"No, I cannot. I am busy.
The fox and weasel are coming.
"If you want to bless me,
you will have to bless my bottom."
"Very well. Be it so."
And El-ahrairah's tail grew shining white,
and it flashed like a star.
And his back legs grew long and powerful.
He tore across the hill
faster than any creature in the world.
"All the world will be your enemy,
Prince with a Thousand Enemies.
"And whenever they catch you,
they will kill you.
"But first, they must catch you...
"digger, listener, runner.
"Prince with the swift warning.
"Be cunning and full of tricks...
"and your people
will never be destroyed."
Along the edge of that wood, there.
Enjoyed many a game pie from it, too.
You can't hold back progress.
Shame, though.
It's gone 8:00, and I told Elizabeth we'd go into Newbury this evening.
Old sun sets so late in summer, it's morning before...
I think it's safe now, Fiver.
There's still something strange about the warren this evening.
Is it dangerous?
It's not exactly danger. It's...
I don't know. Something oppressive.
Like thunder.
It seems safe enough now, though.
Come on, see if you can find me a coltsfoot. If you can't, no one can.
- What's going on?
- It's only that runt, Fiver.
Jumping at bluebottles again.
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Fiver found it, Toadflax.
And we'll eat it.
Coltsfoot are for Owsla. You know that.
Tell you the truth,
I'm getting sick and tired of it.
Sometimes I feel like clearing out of the warren altogether.
Never mind. Let's forget it, and try to enjoy the evening.
Hazel?
Hazel, this is where it comes from.
I know now that terrible thing is coming.
- What do you mean?
- Look.
The field! The field!
- It's covered with blood!
- Blood? Don't be silly.
All right, Fiver. It's getting dark.
- We should get back to the burrow.
- Back to the burrow?
It'll come there. Don't think it won't.
It's all around us.
Now, stop it, Fiver.
We've got to go away from here. All of us.
- Go away? What, the whole warren?
- Yes, before it's too late.
You're being silly.
They'll think you're out of your mind.
You must listen to me, Hazel.
Something very bad is going to happen.
We'd better try and see the Chief Rabbit.
You can tell him about it.
I don't expect he'll like the idea at all.
We've got to go away from the warren!
All of us!
- Go away?
- Yes, before it's too late.
Is something wrong?
- What's the matter?
- Is there danger?
Come on. Let's find out what's happened.
- Hazel? It is Hazel, isn't it?
- It is.
- What are you doing here?
- We want to see the Chief Rabbit, Bigwig.
"We"? You mean he wants to see him, too?
- Yes.
- I must.
- What's it all about?
- Bigwig? What do they want?
- They want to see the Chief Rabbit.
- What for?
- I have to...
- Send them away.
I'll take care of it, Holly.
Look, Bigwig, when have I ever asked to see the Chief Rabbit before?
All right.
Wait here.
Excuse me, sir. These two outskirts have asked to see you.
Is it all right if I bring them down?
Come on, then, though I'll probably get my ears chewed off for this.
Now, Walnut.
- It is Walnut, isn't it?
- No, sir. Hazel.
I knew your mother well. And your friend?
- My brother, sir. Fiver.
- Your brother.
Now, do tell me how I can help you.
Well, he says there's a bad danger coming to our warren.
A bad danger.
How very upsetting.
Now, what sort of danger, I wonder?
I don't know. But it's bad. It's so bad.
Well, now. What ought we to do?
- Go away. All of us. Now.
- Now? In May?
The mating season?
And where would we go to?
He's had these feelings before, and he's been right again and again.
I shall have to consider this very carefully.
Perhaps we'll discuss it later, in the summer.
We can't wait!
It's been good of you to come, Walnut.
Bigwig!
- Bigwig.
- Sir?
- What was that all about?
- Well, sir...
Your duty as an officer is to protect this burrow.
- Yes, sir.
- Those two lunatics...
Yes, sir.
- Who's that?
- It's me.
- Dandelion?
- No, Blackberry.
Dandelion told me you were leaving the warren tonight.
- If it's true, I'd like to come along.
- We'd like to come along, too.
- I don't much like the look of things.
- We must get everyone.
That Toadflax fellow followed me down the run.
It could mean the Owsla has been turned out tonight.
Then the sooner we're off, the better.
It's the Owsla. They're coming.
- There aren't many of you left, are there?
- Bigwig? Are you off duty?
Off duty, and likely to remain off.
I've left the Owsla.
Fiver, I've been thinking about what you said.
- We're leaving.
- Leaving? All of you? Where to?
We don't know exactly. But we're going.
- You're all under arrest!
- Under arrest?
- What do you mean?
- What for?
Spreading dissension, inciting to mutiny.
- There's a bad danger coming.
- It's not good.
You'll all come with me.
Is he alone?
I am captain of Owsla.
Go, now, or we'll kill you.
It's you who'll be killed.
- Bigwig!
- Yes, you know me.
- He'll come back with the Owsla soon.
- Right. Well, I think I'll come with you.
Hazel, we'll have to stop here.
Fiver and that other half-size, we're all in.
They need to rest.
He's right, Hazel.
Look. Once we're beyond the woods... we'll really be clear of the Owsla.
We can rest then.
I've never been in a wood before, Hazel.
It looks dangerous.
Follow me.
A lendri!
This way.
- It had just killed. I saw blood on its lips.
- Lucky for us, it had.
Otherwise, it might have been quicker.
- We shall have to cross it.
- Cross it? Who's going to cross it?
- What do you want to cross it for?
- Are you sure about this?
Yes. But I don't think I can swim, Hazel.
I'm worn out.
- Pipkin is even worse off than me.
- We can't just sit here.
I know what we ought to be looking for.
A high, lonely place with dry soil... where we can see and hear all around, and men hardly ever come.
- There's a dog loose in the wood.
- Well, that does it.
- A dog?
- Come on.
What do you think will happen when he picks up our scent?
Those that can swim, swim.
The others will have to make out the best they can.
That's not good enough.
We got into this together, we'll get out of it together.
Hazel, look.
It floats.
That's it. That's it!
Fiver, get on, quickly.
Silver, Bigwig, get your nose under it.
Push it out.
Quickly!
Keep still!
- Are you all right?
- Of course.
That was a good idea of yours, Blackberry.
Yes. Let's try to remember it.
Might come in handy again.
- Does anyone know where we're going?
- Hazel does, I'm sure.
I've never seen anything like that before.
- The man-thing killed it.
- A man-thing?
A hrududu. It runs on it.
- The what?
- The hrududu.
- It runs on it?
- Yeah, faster than we can.
- It's dangerous, then. It could catch us.
- No, no.
It won't take any notice of us at all.
I'll show you.
Watch this.
See? It's not interested.
What are you waiting for?
Well? Come along, then.
They need to rest, Hazel.
Something's up ahead.
A warm, friendly burrow, perhaps?
No, not a burrow. A field.
A great field of scented plants that will cover us until we're rested.
You're beginning to sound like a chief, Hazel.
- Hazel-rah.
- Hazel-rah?
That'll be the day I call him chief, that will.
Violet's gone.
We'd better keep moving.
We'll have to stop soon, Hazel.
They're frightened and tired.
Over there. We'll rest there.
Can't rest there. That's a man-place.
There are no men there now.
It looks all right.
What's happening back home, I wonder.
Think, when we lived in our own burrows:
Dry, soft, warm bodies.
- Now, look, we can't go on like this.
- It gets worse the further we go.
Where are we going?
It won't be much longer.
Then we can all rest.
- How much longer?
- We never should have left.
- Suppose Fiver's all wrong?
- We want to go back and find out.
Go back? After all we've been through?
And probably get killed for wounding
Captain Holly, an Owsla officer?
- Talk sense, for Frith's sake.
- We must go on, until we reach the hills.
Those that go back will not...
Not safe...
I don't believe you know where you're going.
Now, listen to me, you bunch of mole-snouted, muckraking...
It looks like you've come a long way.
Do you live here?
Yes, this is our warren.
We need to stay here for a while.
Why not? We supposed you would.
But I don't think there are enough of you to live very comfortably on your own.
There are enough of us to protect ourselves.
Don't get upset.
Who are you? What do you want?
My name is Cowslip, and I don't want anything.
Yeah, what about the others?
We have plenty of empty burrows, if that's what you mean.
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I hate the rain.
Funny smell.
We ought to have nothing to do with that Cowslip, or his warren.
It might be drier in there.
Whatever will he think of us if we don't go in?
- I'll tell you. He'll think we're afraid.
- Afraid? Who's afraid?
He seemed friendly enough.
What has he got to gain by asking us to join him?
We can't sit out here like fools.
Well, come along then.
They think I'm mad, but you know I'm not... and you still won't listen.
Hazel?
Come along, Fiver.
There's that smell again.
It's almost like man.
Oh, it's you, is it? How nice.
I'm so glad you've come.
This is rather a big warren.
Yes. Please, help yourself to flayrah.
There are fresh roots here daily.
The man throws it out.
Man? What man?
A lot of the burrows are lying empty, you know... so you're all welcome to any that you choose.
Where are all the others?
Please, eat all you like.
We'll leave you to your...
Where are they all?
Where? Try asking Cowslip
"where" anything.
They seem sad.
Like trees in November.
Well, I still think we've made a big change for the better.
Do you think the man puts the food out there because of a kind heart?
It's not poison.
There's something unnatural and evil and twisted about this place.
It feels like mist.
Like being deceived, and losing our way.
Some of us are gathering and suggesting stories.
- We're hoping you'll tell one.
- Hazel can tell you about our adventures.
How we had the good luck to join you.
Surely, there's no harm in that.
Dandelion, why don't you tell us the story of El-ahrairah?
El-ahrairah and his trickery don't really mean very much to us, charming as it is.
Rabbits will always need tricks.
No, we need dignity, and above all, the will to accept our fate.
As one of our poets is fond of saying, if I may quote...
- Yes, of course.
- Please, do.
"Where are you going, stream?
"Far, far away
"Take me with you, stream
"Take me on your dark journey
"Lord Frith, take me far away
To the hearts of light
"The silence, I give you my breath
- "My life, the silence"
- I've had enough!
- Where are you going?
- Away, to the hills.
By yourself, alone? You'll die.
- You're closer to death than I.
- Determined to ruin it for us, aren't you?
No!
Me, me, me. All the time.
"But, I'm in a mist."
- Bigwig!
- "Everything's bad!"
- No!
- "I've a funny feeling in my toe."
- No, no!
- I'm finished with you.
What's more,
I'm going to make sure everyone else is.
Bigwig, listen. You're in a snare. A snare.
Now, what did they tell you in Owsla?
Think.
No good biting wire.
Run to the warren and get the others.
Blackberry, Silver and Cowslip.
Be quick. He'll die.
Blackberry! Dandelion! Come quickly!
Come on. Hurry up. It's Bigwig.
He's still breathing. What can we do?
- We've got to loosen the wire somehow.
- Yes, but how?
- Is Cowslip coming? Maybe he knows.
- He wouldn't come.
- He told me to stop talking about it.
- He told you what?
This is it. The wire's on a peg.
We've got to dig it out.
The peg's narrower down there. It tapers.
I can't get my teeth into it.
Pipkin, you go in.
The splinters prick you.
It's hard to breathe.
The peg's nearly through.
Fiver, you go in.
I can't hear him breathing.
It's broken in two. It's free.
Bigwig, the peg's out. You're free.
I think he's gone.
We've got you out, Bigwig.
You're free.
- Bigwig, please don't die.
- It's no use.
We got you out.
What shall we do without him?
"My heart has joined the thousand
For my friend stopped running today"
You pay for it. The food, the warren. But no one must ever ask where anyone was... or speak of the wires.
The whole place is snared, everywhere.
- They left Bigwig to die.
- Silver's right.
Let's drive them out, take their warren and live there ourselves.
Yes. Back to the warren.
- Back to the warren.
- Embleer Frith, you fools!
That warren's nothing but a death hole.
Let's help ourselves to a roof of bones.
Who killed them?
Bigwig! You're alive!
- Are you all right?
- We thought you were dead.
- Let him alone. Let him rest.
- I don't have to rest.
- What do we do now, Fiver?
- Go away from here.
Look. Look.
That's the place for us. High, lonely hills... where the wind and the sound carry, and the ground's as dry as straw in a barn.
That's where we ought to be.
That's where we have to get to.
Pipkin.
Pipkin.
Pipkin!
Why don't we go and look around the farm?
Farm, Hazel? What for?
- Cats and dogs.
- I've got a little plan.
- Won't it be dangerous?
- Of course not.
- Is it safe?
- Of course.
- Let's all go.
- No.
Just you and me.
I think I see a dog.
Where? It's tied up.
Give it a wide berth. We don't want it to wake up the whole farm.
This is the BBC Home Service.
They are up. Hazel?
- Let's go back.
- Just a little further.
Rabbits. So, that's your secret plan.
I'm going inside to take a look around.
Is it safe in there?
Of course. You wait here.
- But if you see a cat...
- A cat?
- You will let me know at once, all right?
- Right.
I'm Hazel.
Hazel.
My name's Clover.
- Where do you come from?
- Far away.
My friends and I live as we please.
We eat grass, lie in the sun.
- Do you ever get out?
- Oh, yes.
Sometimes, a child takes us out on the grass.
- Would you like to join us?
- Join you? But how?
How can we join you?
Hazel! There's a cat outside.
I must go back to my friends.
But we'll be back, and any of you who wish can come along with us.
- Where is it?
- There. I think it smelt us.
- I'll get you away.
- Thank you.
- Just follow me closely.
- Yes.
- And run when I do.
- Run when you do.
You look hungry.
Rats getting too clever, I suppose.
I bet you can't run at all.
You pie-eyed, saucer-licking scrap-scraper.
Can you run?
You'll see.
I think not.
What's all that, then?
Tab? Tab!
Let them alone. Cruel thing.
What is it?
There's something coming up the line of the hedge.
- Can you see it?
- I hear it. It's something big.
- A cat?
- I don't know.
Bigwig!
Quiet. I want to listen.
Bigwig!
Bigwig!
It's the Black Rabbit of Inlè!
Don't talk like that. They'll go tharn.
We go by the will of the Black Rabbit.
- When he calls you, you have to go.
- Stay where you are.
- Who's there?
- All dead!
All gone!
It's Captain Holly!
- Holly, it's me, Bigwig.
- I found you.
I found you.
He's been hurt.
Look at that wound on his shoulder.
I remember you.
- You're the one that saw it coming.
- But what happened?
Our warren, destroyed.
Destroyed? How?
Men came. Filled in the burrows.
Couldn't get out.
There was a strange sound.
You see, the air turned bad.
Runs blocked with dead bodies.
We couldn't get out.
Everything turned mad.
Warren, herbs, roots, grass...
all pushed into the earth.
- Men have always hated us.
- No.
They just destroyed the warren because we were in their way.
They'll never rest until they've spoiled the earth.
I tried to find you.
I wandered for days.
The Efrafans wouldn't let me go.
They ripped my ear.
Ripped it.
I tried to find you.
Efrafans? What's he talking about?
Holly.
Let him be.
He's had a bad time.
He can tell us about it when he's rested.
A young doe has a request, sire.
A doe wants to see me?
Says she represents a group, sire.
I see.
- Your name?
- Hyzenthlay, sir.
Don't be frightened. You're safe here.
Get on with it!
Sir, several of us proposed an expedition to start... a new warren somewhere else.
- A new warren? Out of the question.
- But, you don't understand.
The system is breaking down.
Explain that.
We can't produce litters.
We're overcrowded.
I want no further discussion.
- We'll go as far as you like.
- Here or anywhere else.
Thank you, sir.
Campion, have her watched.
That's it, Hazel.
That's where we have to be.
Let me get this straight, Fiver.
- You want us to climb this, is that it?
- Yes!
Come on, Pipkin!
Come and look.
You can see the whole world!
I found a burrow, Hazel.
Under that beech hanger... with a great hall and no smell of death or disease.
Frith on the hills!
He made it all for us!
Frith may have made it, but Fiver found it.
- I've never seen anything like it.
- It's some kind of a bird.
Are you hurt?
Bigwig, I've got an idea.
- See if you can find some worms.
- Worms? Me, dig for worms?
What for, for Frith's sake?
I get up plenty soon.
- He's hurt and we want to help him.
- A bird? What for?
We help you.
Piss off!
What for help me?
What happened to you?
Damn cat jump me, farm cat.
We know her.
We take you to burrow.
Go away. Wing no good, but I walk plenty good.
- Is long way?
- Where you come from?
From big water.
My home by big water.
We go.
I thought everything would be fine once we got here, but it's not.
Because now we've got here,
I find it's not that simple.
What do you mean?
This place is as safe as Fiver said it was.
I think we've done very well for ourselves.
- But we don't have any does.
- Does?
Does.
Not one, and that means no kittens.
- And after we're gone, no warren.
- So that's why you went to that farm.
I thought we'd be able to get some hutch rabbits to join us.
What's to be done then, Hazel?
Set off again?
And where?
There's not been a sniff of another rabbit since we got here.
The bird, Kehaar.
We'll get the bird to search for us.
What home? This hole?
Where are mates? Where are chicks?
Mate make eggs, mate sit on eggs... hatch eggs, many eggs. We feed chick.
Egg robbers come, we fight.
You stupid bunnies!
You got no mates!
Where are mates?
Where are chicks?
Plenty trouble for you.
You need mates!
It's working, Hazel.
You got no brains. You no plan.
You need mate for plan.
Listen.
I got plan for you.
Wing better, I go fly.
Fly for you.
I find mates.
What a splendid idea, Kehaar!
How clever of you to think of it.
You very fine bird.
When will you be able to fly?
I fly any time. Stand back.
When I fly... Stand back.
Stand back. Back, back.
I need room.
Wings good.
Feathers clean.
I soar!
I glide!
I circle.
Then, I soar!
Bigwig said you couldn't make a friend out of him.
- He's probably gone back to the big water.
- I think you're right.
Blackberry, I want you to get Dandelion... and meet me here after the others are asleep.
- It's no good asking you not to go.
- It'll be perfectly safe, Fiver.
I'll take the greatest care.
Clover.
Clover!
Who's that?
It's me. We're back.
Hazel.
- What are you doing up there?
- I've come to let you out.
Will you come with us?
- We're all right here.
- Yes.
Good.
Come on.
Come on, move.
- Lucy's rabbits are out, look.
- Let's get them in, quick.
There's a wild rabbit, look.
There he goes.
Keep the torch on them.
I don't know, John, whether you hit it or not.
- I reckon he's in those nettles.
- Have a look, then.
I hit him, all right.
That's blood down there, see?
That don't signify.
He might be a long way off by now.
I reckon you've lost him.
No, we ain't.
Fiver, there's been some trouble.
Hazel's been shot.
No.
The Black Rabbit serves Lord Frith... but he does no more than his appointed task.
Hazel's not dead.
Perfect landing.
Hazel's been wounded.
The farm man shot him.
Come on, follow me.
Come on!
- You get black stones out?
- What do you mean?
Always with gun is coming little black stones.
You never see?
Take out black stones, he get better.
Let me see leg.
Many stones.
Did you find anything on your flight?
- Efrafa.
- Can you guide us there?
Many rabbits.
Too many rabbits.
We wouldn't be enough to fight one of their patrols.
What do you mean?
You see this? They did it to me.
It's an identification mark.
Tells you when you can be above ground.
- What do you mean? Who's to stop you?
- Their Owsla.
Their chief is called Woundwort.
General Woundwort.
I don't think even you would
match up to him, Bigwig.
Under him are captains,
each one in charge of a mark.
If you're found above ground
at the wrong time...
they take you before the council
for punishment.
Some of them must get away.
They caught one trying to run away
when I was there.
Blackavar was his name.
When they'd finished with him,
both his ears were ripped to shreds...
worse than this one of mine.
He was lucky not to have been killed.
There was another one, a doe, Hyzenthlay.
I couldn't have escaped without her help.
- Why didn't she go with you?
- She wouldn't go without the others.
Then some might be persuaded to leave?
Yes, but you'd never get them out of Efrafa.
You got out.
Only because Lord Frith
sent one of his great messengers.
I didn't see what happened to them.
It must have cut them down.
It's not going to be easy, but we don't have much choice.
- We'll start off as soon as I'm fit to travel.
- I don't like this idea of yours at all.
Holly, I want you to stay here.
You're known to them and it could be dangerous for you.
I've been in Efrafa, and I tell you you're making a bad mistake... that might very well get you all killed.
There's a homba.
No one move. Keep still, all of you.
- What's he up to?
- Trying to draw it off, I suppose.
Frith and Inlè!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, hurry!
- Aren't you wounded?
- Never better! Let's go!
- What was that all about?
- I just lost my head, Hazel.
I've been strung up all day, thinking about Efrafa.
Anyway, I feel a lot better now.
Why did you cry out, if you're all right?
I didn't. I just stopped limping, you know, ready to run really fast... when I bumped into a group of rabbits, face to face.
I tried to warn them about the homba, but all they did was try to stop me.
One of them said, "You stay here."
So I knocked him down, I had to, and raced off.
- Next thing I heard was this squeal.
- So the homba got the other rabbit?
He must have.
After all, I led them right into it.
But I never saw what happened.
It's not to rest here, they come.
A patrol?
Yeah, is coming for find you, is go!
You go to river, then they not find you.
All of you, under that bridge unless you want your ears chewed off.
Yeah, come along.
By other side iron road.
I think maybe they no like for go across iron road.
Hazel, you go on.
This may be my chance to get into Efrafa.
But it's too...
All right, take care.
Now, Kehaar will meet you tomorrow, in that kale field.
Tell him what you've worked out.
Mr. Hazel, what wait for?
He's right, Hazel, you must go now.
We'll go down to the river and wait there for you to tell us what to do.
I want you to find some way to keep them from following us.
Go on now, before we're all caught!
It's a wide patrol. Be careful, Hyzenthlay.
Sir, we've picked up this hlessi and brought him in.
- Who are you?
- My name is Bigwig.
"Bigwig, sir!"
- What were you doing?
- I've come to join Efrafa.
- Why?
- Surprised you ask... sir.
Is there anything odd about wanting to join?
I'll ask the questions. What can you do?
I can run and fight.
- Fight, can you?
- I've been an officer in an Owsla.
So, you came to join us.
I thought you might have some use for me.
Well, for the time being, you'll be assigned a post in the patrol.
You'll take orders from Captain Campion.
If you want a doe, you have your choice here.
You're not an officer for nothing.
Thank you, sir.
And... you'll be identified by your mark.
Those Efrafans will be fast and savage.
I need to find a way to get away from them.
If what Holly says is true, we couldn't possibly stand and fight them.
Then we'll have to find another way.
What on earth is that, Kehaar?
Him fish.
Hazel, come and look at this.
What is it?
Is boat. Man make them go on water.
It floats, Hazel.
It floats.
Aren't you going to silflay?
I don't silflay at this time, sir.
Tell him why you're here, Blackavar.
I come here for the mark to...
I come here for the mark to see me... how I've been punished for trying to leave the warren.
The council were merciful.
He keeps trying to run away.
Captain Campion caught him this time.
His ears were ripped and he is to show himself... at every morning and evening silflay as an example to the others.
If you ask me, he won't last much longer.
He'll meet a blacker rabbit than himself one of these nights.
That doe over there, what's her name?
Fancy her, do you?
She's called Hyzenthlay, but look elsewhere, she's a troublemaker.
The council's got their eye on her.
You go now, talk to Bigwig.
Yeah, I go talk to Mr. Bigwig.
He'll be in field by arch on the iron road.
Go find him.
By the iron road? Yeah, I go and find him.
He'll tell you the plan.
He tell me the plan? I know the plan!
Now don't attract attention.
Of course not, of course not.
I be quiet. I be clever.
They no see me. Kehaar, Kehaar.
You wait here.
- Hyzenthlay.
- Sir?
I want to talk with you.
I am in the mark and under your orders, sir.
Do you remember a pale gray rabbit called Holly, you helped escape?
- You've made a mistake, sir.
- Listen, Hyzenthlay, listen carefully.
I'm from a warren where life is free, where you can live as you wish.
I've come to bring you out of Efrafa, as many as will come.
You might be a spy, sent by the council.
You know I'm not.
Will you join us, and persuade your friends, as well?
Trust me. My friends are not far away.
My courage, my spirit is so much less than it was.
We can escape from Efrafa, believe me.
Yes.
I think I do.
- Listen carefully.
- Yeah!
We're ready. We leave at sunset.
Ready good!
There will be lots of us.
We'll meet you at the iron bridge.
- When?
- Sunset.
Good! Good. Sunset.
Then you must guide us to the river.
- Plenty good trick.
- Trick, what trick?
Listen, if you see a patrol following us you must drive them away, terrify them.
Yeah, I fly at them.
Remember: sunset.
You plenty good fellow.
It's set.
When?
Get them to the near hind mark at sunset, just before early silflay.
- Suppose something happens?
- Nothing will happen. We can do it.
Yes.
I think we can.
Sometimes I can tell when things are true.
Sometimes I can see it.
A high down with trees and...
I've become foolish.
You'll have to meet this friend of mine.
He talks just like that.
We'll be ready.
Sunset, then. And a bird will fight for us.
- A bird?
- Even Woundwort won't expect that.
Bigwig!
That white bird you were talking to this morning...
- Talking to, sir?
- You were very close to it. Why?
Well, I've never been hurt by a bird.
That's not what I asked.
To tell you the truth, sir,
I think I was trying to impress you.
In future, stay in your own mark.
Sir.
One more thing:
What do you know about a homba?
- A homba, sir?
- You led it onto some rabbits?
I didn't intend to.
I didn't know they were there.
You didn't report it.
Everything out of the ordinary is to be reported.
I didn't know running from a homba was out of the ordinary.
That was a patrol on the track of a band of strangers.
Do you know anything about them?
I saw some tracks, but I can't tell you anymore than that, sir.
I'm taking out a wide patrol tomorrow.
We'll cross the iron road and try to pick up their tracks.
I want you to come along.
Yes, sir.
Campion, follow him.
Don't let him out of your sight.
I've been told to tell you early silflay has been canceled this evening.
No one told me anything about it.
Have a look over there and you'll see why.
Now, Blackavar.
The new officer, sir, he's gone.
Bigwig?
He's wounded Sherbil and taken a crowd of the mark with him.
I'll blind him. I'll blind him!
- Bigwig, where's the bird?
- He'll be here.
He'd better!
Where is that bird?
What I am doing here?
I am wait for long time.
Is no sunset. Is no good here.
Where are they?
They should be here by now.
Silver, go up to the iron bridge and see if you can find them.
They're coming.
Bigwig, the general!
What will we do?
It nearly came off.
We'll take one or two of them with us before it's finished.
Bigwig?
You traitors!
Campion, get this miserable group back to their marks.
I'll settle with you myself, Bigwig.
No need to take you back.
Come on and try, you crack-brained slave driver.
Get away, blast you!
Get away, you damned white bird!
Straight ahead, to the river.
Keep going, it's a friend.
- You did it, Bigwig. You did it.
- I did, didn't I?
It's not over yet.
They gone.
Keep going, down to the river.
- The general's behind me.
- Where do we go, Hazel?
I trusted you, Bigwig.
You can trust me now.
You'll either go into the river or be torn to pieces.
There's nowhere left to run.
Campion, Lily... when I give the word, we go straight into them.
- That bird can't save you now.
- There it is!
What you do now?
We're going back to our warren, Kehaar.
Good. You go, I go.
Is finish here for me.
- I go to big water!
- Take care of that wing.
Is winter plenty cold, then I come back.
Come back anytime.
And thank you, Kehaar.
Big water!
Get the holes filled in.
Everyone underground.
- What's the matter?
- The general.
- Where?
- The wood behind us.
- It's full of Efrafans.
- I'm not going back.
- Maybe we ought to leave.
- Anyone who wants to can go.
We went through a lot to get here, and I'm not leaving now.
Neither am I.
If I'm for the Black Rabbit, one or two from Efrafa will come with me.
We'll fill in the holes deep.
They'll have to dig us out.
They can't be out there long without attracting elil.
- The Efrafans will never give up.
- Maybe we should leave.
We're staying.
But there may be a better way.
- Let me come with you.
- No, they know you too well.
I'll go alone. Now, get those holes filled in.
I won't be long.
They'll take us back to Efrafa.
Their Owsla will.
Listen, we're not finished yet, not by a long shot.
You were one of those on the riverbank.
Did Bigwig send you?
I'm a friend of Bigwig's.
What was left unfinished on the riverbank will be finished now.
It would be better for both of us if we could come to terms.
Terms?
Very well.
These are my terms.
Hand over all the deserters immediately.
We couldn't agree to that.
But I can suggest something better, for both of us.
- You're in no position to bargain.
- We shouldn't be fighting each other.
We have enough enemies as it is.
Perhaps we should be together.
A joining of free, independent warrens.
I have no time for this nonsense.
- Shall I kill him, sir?
- No.
You take back our terms.
And you tell your chief, Bigwig, that if he and Hyzenthlay... and the others aren't waiting outside when I come for them...
I'll tear out every throat in the place.
Do you remember the rats in the barn?
We got out of that, all right.
Yes, we did. We got out of that, all right.
They're into the beech roots.
Start at this end.
- How cold!
- What is it? Are you all right?
I've tried to listen, only I can't hear it.
I'm going away, Hazel. I'm floating.
- Cold, how...
- Fiver. Fiver.
- Can you hear me?
- Listen.
They have something down there that's strange.
Get out, get out!
They had a great bird that turned into a shaft of lightning.
And there was another creature that took them away down the river.
- Here, I reckon we ought to go back home.
- Who said that?
- Nobody, sir.
- You were put there to dig. Get back to it.
Great Frith, stop him, Hazel.
The others are going tharn.
Wake up. Fiver, wake up.
There's a dog loose in the wood.
There's a dog loose in the wood.
"We need to cross
because there's a dog loose in the wood."
"There's a dog loose in the wood."
Bigwig, I need runners.
Dandelion, Blackberry.
Hyzenthlay can run.
Good. We've hardly any time.
I've got a plan.
If it works, it will finish Woundwort for good.
When we're gone, block this run and get everyone back behind the wall.
Hold them off as long as you can.
- Don't give in to them.
- Where are you going?
El-ahrairah will show me what to do.
Let them go.
It's their chief, Bigwig, I'm after.
Find their chief!
Hyzenthlay, you hide here.
When the time comes, get back to the warren.
- It will all depend on you.
- I'll be ready.
Lord Frith,
I know you've looked after us well...
and it's wrong to ask even more of you...
but my people are in terrible danger.
So, I'd like to make a bargain with you:
My life in return for theirs.
There is not a day or night
that a doe offers her life for her kittens...
or some honest captain of Owsla,
his life for his chief.
But there is no bargain.
What is, is what must be.
Blackberry, this is where we leave you.
Stay close and don't move.
Don't break too soon.
- Are you clear what's to be done?
- Yes.
You lie in the grass, just there, opposite him.
If we meet again, Hazel-rah... we'll have the makings of the best story ever.
And you'll be the one to tell it.
Can you run?
I think not.
I think not.
Tab! Tab!
I told you once,
I was trying to impress you.
I hope I have.
And I told you that I would kill you myself.
There's no white bird here, Bigwig.
Why throw your life away?
Hraka, sir.
Come out.
My chief's told me to defend this run.
Your chief?
Run! Run for your lives!
Come back! Come back, you fools!
Come back!
Come back and fight!
Dogs aren't dangerous!
General Woundwort's body
was never found.
It could be that he still lives his fierce life
somewhere else.
But from that day on,
mother rabbits would tell their kittens...
that if they did not do as they were told...
the General would get them.
Such was Woundwort's monument.
Perhaps it would not have displeased him.
El-ahrairah knew, then, that Frith was his friend.
Every evening, when Frith has done his day's work... and lies calm and easy in the red sky...
El-ahrairah and his children, and his children's children... come out of their holes and feed and play in his sight.
For they are his friends, and he has promised...
Hazel.
That they can never be destroyed.
Hazel.
- You know me, don't you?
- I don't.
Yes, my Lord.
I know you.
I've come to ask
if you would like to join my Owsla.
We shall be glad to have you,
and I know you'd like it.
You've been feeling tired, haven't you?
If you're ready, we might go along now.
You needn't worry about them.
They'll be all right...
and thousands like them.
If you'll come along,
I'll show you what I mean.
"All the world will be your enemy,
Prince with a Thousand Enemies.
"Whenever they catch you,
they will kill you.
"But first, they must catch you...
"digger, listener, runner.
"Prince with the swift warren.
"Be cunning...
"and your people
will never be destroyed."
It's my turn for breakfast this morning, Gromit.
I'd like a three-minute egg...
Oh, steady on.
Whoa, Gromit!
Oh!
Well, that went as well as could be expected, didn't it, hmm?
Though I might have to make a small adjustment to the drop.
A touch painful on re-entry.
Cracking toast, Gromit.
Any post, was there, perchance?
Oh, dear, a bit steep.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I'll be...
They're all bills.
Oh, dear, oh, dear me.
We shall have to economize, Gromit.
I'll have to let that room out.
Oh, dear.
Oh, just look at that.
I'm down to my last few coppers.
And those presents weren't cheap either.
Well, Gromit, let's see what's on the 9:05, shall we, hmm?
Here she comes now.
I wonder what this can be.
Happy birthday! Chuck!
I knew you'd like it.
Here, let me help you.
You look like somebody owns you now.
And that's only the first part.
Come and look in here.
I think you'll find this present a valuable addition to our modern lifestyle.
They're techno-trousers.
Ex-NASA.
Fantastic for walkies.
All you do is attach the lead on here.
Then program in.
Walkies, 10 minutes,
20 minutes.
Whoops!
Have a nice walk,
Gromit.
Oh...
It's no use prevaricating about the bush.
Nice walkies, hmm?
How were the techno-trousers?
Oh, there's someone at the door, Gromit.
I wonder who that could be.
Oh, it's about the room, then.
Well, that's grand.
Eh, would you like to come this way and inspect?
I'm asking 20 a week.
That would include your breakfast.
I suppose you like kippers, do you?
Partial to a nice black pudding, myself, with bacon, of course.
I'm sure that we can come to an amicable agreement.
As I say, it's a bit dingy at present.
But it's surprising what a lick of paint will do, isn't it?
Oh! But I don't think...
That wasn't quite what we had in mind.
Wouldn't you like to see-
Oh, dear.
Look... there's something
I've got to tell you.
It's, um... no pets.
Does that suit you?
Oh. Seems pleasant enough.
Cheer up, Gromit.
Surprising what a lick of paint will do, isn't it?
Oh.
Oh, so that's where my braces went.
Wonderful things, these techno-trousers.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Lovely morning, Gromit.
Oh!
Thank you very much.
That's just grand.
Oh, thank you kindly.
What do you think of that, then, Gromit?
Eh? Our paying guest.
Nice drop of Bordeaux, this, eh?
Here's to paying guests.
More cheese, Penguin? Eh?
Good night, Penguin.
Sleep well.
Oh.
That was lovely cheese.
Oh-oh-oh. Oh.
Yeow!
It's the wrong trousers.
The wrong trousers!
What have you done with the controls, Gromit?
Now, that'll do.
Just hold on a minute.
Stop it. Gromit!
Stop these confounded things!
This isn't funny, Gromit.
The joke's over.
Get me out of these trousers!
Lovely day!
Help!
Gromit!
Gangway!
Sorry!
Whoa!
It's the wrong trousers, Gromit, and they've gone wrong.
Stop them, Gromit! Stop them!
Help me!
Gromit, the trousers have gone haywire.
Get me out!
Help!
Oh, I'm tired.
A good doze, that's what I need: get me strength back.
What a... what a shocking calami... calami... calamity.
What's the game, then?
Where am I?
What's going on? Yikes!
Gromit!
Gromit!
I must be dreaming.
Where the devil am I?
Oh!
Great heavens above.
Whatever is it?
Help! Get me down!
Help!
What's the game, then? Eh?
Where am I?
That's quite enough.
You'll be hearing from my solicitor about this.
Mind how you go.
You can't go taking liberties like this.
I'm a respectable citizen.
Most definitely not legal, this.
Good grief, it's you!
Now, let me out of these trousers this minute.
Steady on, will you?
This wardrobe's nearly new, you know.
Let me out!
I'll give you what for, you tyke!
Excuse me.
Uh, hello?
I should think so too.
Hey!
Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do, isn't it, Gromit?
Steady on.
Watch where you're putting them paws.
Oh, careful, lad.
Oh, my goodness.
It'll ruin the woodwork.
Oh, there goes me knotty pine.
Where are we going?
I can't see a thing.
What's happening?
Catch me, Gromit.
Don't worry, Gromit!
I'm-whoa- right behind you!
Hang in there, Gromit.
Everything's under control.
I'll have that, if you don't mind, eh?
Tally-ho!
Leave him to me.
I'll get the bounder!
Get him, Gromit!
Gromit, we're doomed.
Mind the table, Gromit!
Gotcha!
Huh?
All yours, Gromit!
Attaboy, Gromit, lad!
Well done.
We did it. Ha-ha!
Thank you, old friend.
Many thanks indeed.
That reward money paid off all our debts.
No more lodgers.
More trouble than they're worth.
I could just fancy some cheese, Gromit.
What do you say?
Cheddar?
Don't forget the crackers.
Ah, all's well that ends well; that's what I say.
Mmm.
Oh, I do like a bit of Gorgonzola.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Man: I'm coming!
I'm coming.
Hi.
I'm Jennifer Hills.
We spoke last week.
Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.
Mockingbird Trail, right?
That is right.
I don't suppose you know how to get out there.
No, I don't.
Well, listen up.
It's a bit tricky.
- Keys.
- Thank you.
These arrows will get you through town.
Over here there are more dirt roads and woods.
Your cabin's a real beaut.
But heck, there ain't another for a good country mile.
I am looking forward to the peace and quiet.
I'm actually a novelist and I'm starting my next book here.
If that's what you're aiming for.
- You just follow this here map.
- Thank you.
Howdy, ma'am.
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
No, that is okay.
You know what?
I am actually lost.
I'm looking for Mockingbird Trail.
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.
- Really?
- Yeah yeah, you're lost.
It's about 10 miles back.
It's gonna be on your left-hand side.
Gonna make a left after a big red mailbox.
Okay, thanks.
I think I saw that.
You staying over in that cabin on Mockingbird?
- Yeah.
- Man: Fancy!
So you know you're running a little hot.
Maybe I should check up under your hood for you.
How's that line working for you?
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?
- I got that.
- No, I got it.
No, I got it.
Oh shit.
I'm sorry, my bad.
- I hit the panic button.
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Better check your underwear,
Johnny.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I said I was fine.
- Okay.
- All right?
Keep the change.
Man:
Got you that time, Johnny.
Bye-bye.
Woman:
How's the writing coming?
You kidding me?
I should have come out here on my first book.
You gonna come back for Hertz's party?
Jen? Did I lose you?
Oh, sorry.
Something just-
Hey.
- You still there?
- Barb, hold on a second.
- Jen, what's going on?
- Let me call you back.
You've got to be kidding me.
Way to go, Jennifer.
Ugh.
Ew!
Jennifer:
No, it won't flush.
Man: Did you check the seal on the flapper?
I did that already.
- You did?
- Yes.
Look, I'm really in a spot here.
- All right, I'll send somebody.
- Okay okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- You'll be there?
- I'm not going anywhere.
Man:
All right, I'll send someone.
Aggh!
So is this gonna take much longer?
Not much.
What's wrong with it?
Yes!
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.
Sorry. You saved me from having to bathe in the lake.
Excuse me.
I, uh- excuse me.
Wait, I didn't-
Ground rule double.
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.
Fine, maybe a triple.
But you gotta knock its guts clean out its mouth if you wanna score a run.
Man, would you turn that shit off?
You're gonna get us in trouble with that human society.
- It's humane, dipshit.
- Yeah, whatever.
I told you, Andy, this thing's gonna make me a fortune.
So you two retards gonna go fishing or what?
Hey, speaking of retards...
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!
Well, Stanley, got us all here now.
What's the big show?
The big show is this.
What did you do this time, film yourself lighting a fart?
I don't know why I bother with you dipshits.
I got Matthew's girlfriend here in a very private moment.
Andy:
Girlfriend?
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since he was sucking on his mama's titties.
He had that city girl all alone and he didn't even try to nail her.
What city girl?
You know what girl.
The one from the gas station the other day.
The one that had you on your ass.
She had Matt here fixing her pipes.
She even gave him a kiss for servicing her.
Bullshit.
No, she- she- she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.
Hey, Matthew, don't you lie to me.
Here it comes.
Get ready for it.
Oh shit.
Andy: Hey, that's some good camerawork, man.
You dirty dog, man.
How the fuck did you get that?
I've been working nights.
She sure is something to look at.
Yeah yeah.
And she likes me.
Come on, Matthew.
That girl wouldn't even give Johnny the time of day.
What?
Shit.
I can tame that ass if I want to.
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.
Stuck-up city bitch.
City bitch like that is ungettable.
Bullshit. I'll get it.
Let me tell you something:
I had that bitch creaming her panties.
Yeah, and she had you shitting in yours.
You don't think I can have that anytime I want to?
Hmm?
Let me tell you something:
Bitch like that, she come out here for one reason and one reason only.
Titties flopping in the window like that for everyone to see.
Come on, you know.
No no.
She's not like that, Johnny.
They're all like that.
Big city cock-teasing whore is all she is.
Fuckin' A.
Shit, Matthew.
You wouldn't know what to do with a piece of ass like that if you got it.
No shit.
But you're lucky
'cause I'm your friend.
I'll show you the way.
Hello.
Nice shot, huh?
Evening.
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!
Well now.
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?
Smile real pretty for the camera, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.
You all better get out of here right now.
I called the cops.
Oh, she called the cops.
You called the police or you will call the police?
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.
What phone did you do that with?
Matthew told us you dropped yours in the drain.
Bloop!
Let's pick it up.
Where the hell is that boy?
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.
Get in here, boy.
Hey hey hey.
It's all right.
Come on now.
Come on, boy.
Come here.
Matthew here says that you didn't pay him for fixing your sink.
That's not true.
He ran out.
I'll take care of it.
Andy:
He's shy, huh?
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.
Hold up, wait a minute.
Let's not worry about any of that right now.
What's a pretty little thing like you doing out here all alone?
I'm writing.
I'm a writer.
She's a writer.
My boyfriend will be here soon.
He's coming up to the cabin.
Is that right?
Oh!
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Boys, now we better blow on out of here.
We don't wanna interrupt your date night.
Date night!
Let me tell you something, sweetheart:
There ain't no man in his right mind that leaves a pretty little thing like you out here all alone.
He's coming.
Night's almost over.
Oh wow.
Johnny:
Come here.
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.
Come here, pretty little thing.
Come here, have a drink with me.
No.
Oh, there you go.
I don't want to.
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?
- See?
- Mm-hmm.
Please, I just don't want to have a drink.
What is this shit right here?
'Cause that's already been opened.
Well shit, boys.
You were right.
She's too good to have a drink with us.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
What are we to you?
A bunch of dirt?
I didn't say that.
Fuckin' A, this bitch is a writer.
"No one wants a phone call at 2:00 in the morning.
When you're 15, it's a prank call.
When you're 21, it's a drunk boyfriend call.
But after 25, it's usually really bad news.
That's how I found out my father died. "
Whose daddy died?
Can't you all just please leave me alone?
Johnny: No!
Just tell me what you want.
What do you want?
I offered you my money.
Mm-hmm.
Whoa!
Here. Here.
Fine. I'll have a drink.
Then you have to leave.
- Andy: All right.
- Johnny: All right.
That ain't shit.
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.
Now see, I-
I know you can do better than that.
I'm sure that when you're out there in the city with all your hoity-toity rich friends,
I bet you can throw 'em back with the best of 'em.
Now can't you?
- I took the drink-
- I said drink that shit!
- Come on. There you go.
- Chug chug! Guzzle!
- Whoo!
- There it is. There it is.
All right, shit.
See, that's not so bad now, is it?
Listen, I'm sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.
But we're even now, right?
Okay?
Just please leave.
Please leave.
Well, that's just not what this is about no more.
What is it about?
I wanna see your teeth.
What?
You heard me, pretty little show horse.
I want to see your teeth.
That-
I don't want to- no.
Now you're gonna show them teeth.
You have beautiful teeth.
There.
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.
Let's see more.
Put your fingers on the inside of your mouth right there.
Now take the other two, stick 'em on the other side.
There you go.
Now pull.
Okay, please, I'm begging you, just go.
No.
Again.
Come here.
There it is.
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.
Shh!
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.
You know why I know you ain't got no boyfriend?
You know why?
'Cause all them city boys are faggots.
Fuckin' A.
Since you ain't got no boyfriend, well, shit, I figured that... this would be your man tonight.
Yeah.
No?
Come here.
Come on, give him a little kiss.
Give him a little kiss, come on.
Give him a little kiss here.
Give him a little kiss here. Kiss him.
Oh shit, come on now.
Come on now. I ain't talking about no fucking peck like you gave Matthew.
I want you to give him a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.
Get up on your knees.
If I don't like your enthusiasm,
I may come bad.
Open up.
Open up.
There it is. There it is.
There it is.
All right, all right.
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.
Just like it's your first time again.
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.
All right, all right.
Shit!
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.
I d-don't want to.
I don't.
What?
What the fuck did you say?
What the hell you mean you d-d-don't want to?
I don't want to, Johnny.
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.
Listen to me.
Fuck that, man.
I ain't fucking waiting.
Aw shit!
Matthew:
She-she likes me.
Johnny:
She likes you, Matthew?
Go ahead.
- Jennifer: Please.
- Suck it, bitch.
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.
Go prove it to me.
Uh-huh.
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!
Johnny:
Come on, boys!
Whoa there.
Whoa there.
Easy, darling.
- Help me! Help me, please.
- Okay, I got you.
I was assaulted.
He came into my cabin and he had a gun.
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.
It was in my mouth.
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.
I know this one.
She rented the place down on Mockingbird Trail.
- I was assaulted.
- Hey, it's okay.
I'm a sheriff.
You're safe.
Now tell me what happened.
These four men- there were four men and they broke into my cabin.
And they had a gun and they assaulted me.
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?
Yes, I'd seen them.
- Around here?
- Yes, they work at the service station
- right outside of town.
- John Miller, no doubt.
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.
Sounds like them boys have been up to no good again.
All right, Earl, you head on back.
- Me and Miss-
- Hills. Jennifer Hills.
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head on over to the cabin and straighten things out.
Miller!
Miller, this is the sheriff.
You and your boys are still here, you come on out right now.
Miller, if you're up there, you'll be leaving by the window.
Ma'am, stay here.
You here alone?
Yes.
With all this?
I didn't plan on drinking it all right away.
I was gonna be here for a couple months.
You drink some this evening?
Yes.
One of them went upstairs and he went through everything.
They do this too?
Please, I really don't care about any of that.
How long you been here?
Just a couple days.
Anything strange happen before this?
You have a run-in with any of these guys?
No, not really.
Just stopped for gas and directions.
Ma'am, is this your marijuana cigarette?
Um, no.
One of the boys must have left it.
You mean to tell me one of them guys is wearing lipstick?
This ain't the big city.
Please, I may have smoked a joint, but that doesn't mean that I made any of this up.
This is Storch.
I'm at Mockingbird cabin.
- Gonna need some backup.
- Backup?
What could you possibly need backup for? I'm the victim.
Ma'am, you've been drinking, smoking marijuana cigarettes.
You got enough booze in here to put the whole town three sheets to the wind.
You're running around in your sleeping garments at the crack of dawn.
You gotta see this from my point of view.
What? They came in here and they assaulted me.
You have to believe me.
Ma'am, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this.
You're making serious accusations about boys I've known since they was kids.
And you haven't been altogether truthful now, have you?
Now please, step up against the wall.
Shoulder width apart.
Ma'am, please.
Look right ahead.
Now...
I want the whole story.
You tell me the whole thing.
You start by telling me what those boys did.
Tell the sheriff the truth, show horse.
Better yet, why don't you show him?
Show him how that pretty little mouth of yours couldn't get enough
- as far as I recall.
- Is that right?
They do this?
Nice little tits.
I asked you a question.
Please.
Johnny: You show the sheriff your teeth there, show horse.
Come on.
- Come on, move.
- Andy: Get!
Move!
Now whinny.
I said whinny!
- Whinny!
- Oh, man!
Whinny! Whinny! Whinny!
Huh. Huh.
Now get on your knees.
Keep going.
Johnny:
Keep whinnying, show horse.
Stanley:
Here we go.
Get on your knees.
Keep whinnying!
Oh-ho-ho!
You oughta tame that little mare of yours.
Come on.
On your feet, show horse.
On your feet or you're not gonna get your sugar cube.
Matthew, get your clothes off, boy.
We're gonna get your cherry popped.
Huh-uh.
Matthew, I ain't asking you a question.
Stop that rubber band shit, homo.
You wanna talk the talk, you better walk the walk.
I'm walking.
- Jennifer: Stop, stop.
- Virgin.
Please stop.
You get your clothes off or I'm gonna slice her from the chin
- to cunt.
- Oh!
Oh yeah!
- Johnny: There's Matthew.
- Stanley: Now he gets it.
Johnny:
Pants off, boy.
Oh, what the hell, Matthew?
He ain't even hard yet.
Well, it's not totally his fault.
She ain't done much to get his motor running now, has she?
Dance.
Dance.
Come on.
- Come on, baby.
- Move it!
Johnny: Prance for us.
Prance, show horse!
Prance for us now. Come on, like you do when you wanna get laid.
Whoo! Come on!
I want you to watch this,
Matthew.
You dance like that in them city clubs?
- Ho!
- Come on now!
You watching this, boy?
Johnny: What?
Okay, I'll- I'll- I'll-
I'll do it.
Okay? Okay.
- Come here.
- Oh, yeah!
Okay, here we go.
Get up, get up.
This is for you, Matthew.
This is for you, boy.
Oh yeah!
Oh shit!
Get her up here.
Shut her up.
No! No! No!
Hold her legs!
Oh my God.
I'll bash your fucking face in, bitch.
- Andy: Shut up.
- No no no!
That's for you.
Get your drawers off, Matthew.
- God damn it.
- Okay.
- Johnny: Here. Here.
- Storch: Get her panties off.
- I'll rip 'em off.
- No!
Yeah, get her.
- Johnny: Damn it, hold her still.
- Come on, retard.
- No! No!
- Hold her down!
- Stick your pee-pee in her.
- Okay!
Come on, Matt, get in here.
Get in there.
Johnny: Yeah!
Storch:
Get in there!
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
- Jennifer: Oh no!
Look at him go.
There's a gang-banger.
Johnny: Feels good, don't it, Matthew, pumping away on her? Get her legs.
Storch: Yeah, come on, son.
Come on, boy!
Deep. Get in deep.
Get in deep.
Deep deep deep deep!
- Deep!
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew.
Get over here.
Hey, put that thing down and get over here.
- Keep her quiet. Fucking gag her.
- Shut your fucking mouth!
Storch:
Gag her!
Johnny: Shut her up!
It feels good, don't it, Matthew?
Yeah yeah!
Keep her quiet now!
Hello, angel.
Daddy's on a call.
Girl:
Daddy, it's Sunday.
You always make breakfast before church.
I know, I know, sweetheart.
Daddy's real busy.
You tell mom I'm running late.
Okay.
Bye, Daddy.
Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
Yeah, Matthew!
He fill her up yet?
Johnny: Damn it. Oh shit!
You're the shit, Matthew.
You're getting your ass beat by a woman.
Johnny: Matthew, you better control that bitch.
Hold her down. Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah, boy.
Over there.
Over there.
Ain't that romantic?
You clean that shit up.
Make her do it.
Andy:
You heard him. Clean it up.
Hey, Matthew, get back here.
You all right, boy?
Stanley:
Oh man, this is so like my fantasy.
You can thank me later.
Andy: You calm down, boy.
You did all right, Matthew.
Jennifer: No no.
Please.
No.
No no.
You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch?
That shit hurts.
- Now take a look, honey.
- No.
I'll bet you're thirsty, huh?
Why don't you have a drink?
- Do it again!
- You like that? Let's have another one.
Hold her down.
Hold her head down.
All right, boys, that filly's got a few more races to run.
You like that, girl?
You like that sweet water, huh? Yeah.
You got some fight left in you, Miss Hills.
I like things rough.
Please. Please.
- Yeah.
- I'm sore.
Please.
I'm sore.
Don't worry now, sweetheart.
I'm an ass man.
No teeth, show horse.
No teeth.
Whoo!
Andy:
God damn, Stanley.
30 seconds.
Must be a new record for you, man.
That bitch was too tight.
Don't you know you're supposed to wait for the lady?
Stanley:
Shit, man, like she cares.
She's laying there like a dead fish.
Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.
Andy: Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna be the pussy today, huh?
Johnny: Don't know what you're bragging about, Andy.
Clocked you just over two minutes.
Andy:
It's been a while, man.
I'm out of practice.
It's been, I don't know, maybe 10 years.
Where you going?
God damn, she's got some fight in her.
Johnny:
Come on, let's chase.
Andy:
Where does she think she's going?
Well, it was fun while it lasted, Miss Hills.
Johnny: Shit!
Johnny:
Where is she?
Hell, she's gotta come up for air sometime.
Shit.
Stanley: Gators must have got her by now. Right, Sheriff?
Listen up.
Creek ends about six miles downstream in Watson.
Between here and there, we're gonna find her.
We split up.
We check the banks, in the timber, under rocks.
Hell, you see a hole big enough for her, I want you in there.
And do not stop till y'all find me a dead city whore.
Nothing.
Not a goddamn thing.
Now what?
Her body will show up one way or another.
Every day we're gonna check the ravine, from the bridge straight down through here and back.
Two shifts a day till we find something.
For how long?
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.
Burn it, all of it.
You hear me?
Yes sir.
You get her wheels down the shop.
Strip it down to its last goddamn nut.
That's gonna take two weeks.
All right, Sheriff, yeah.
I'll have Andy torch it out and I'll rub the numbers out.
Asshole!
The fuck you saving that for, you moron?
It's fucking evidence!
I shit you not!
I need you all on point for this.
And I mean goddamn fucking point.
We clear?
Now pony up.
We got shit to do.
Burn that effing tape.
Andy:
Well, that's all of it, right down to her little titty sling.
Man, this fire's making me hungry.
Well, there's a headline.
We gotta finish this shit.
We gotta get that car in the garage.
Then you can stuff your face till you puke.
Where the hell's Matthew at?
He ain't one to stay behind.
He was looking around the water like some crazed dog after a bone, man.
You keep an eye on him.
We gotta make sure he keeps it together, you hear me?
Just at least until this shit's over.
Gone all day,
I got nervous.
- Anything worth telling?
- Just the usual.
The mess they got on Highway 1 took forever.
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?
Daddy.
Got anything on the stove?
Sure, I'll reheat it.
You'll be proud.
Proud of what?
I was accepted to the honors program, Daddy.
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can.
I expect nothing less from my angel.
Mommy and I are proud of you.
I'm gonna shower up.
Every time I come in here this place gets worse.
Yeah, and business keeps getting better and better.
Mockingbird Trail.
Miss Hills.
She left?
She did indeed.
I couldn't make head nor tail of it.
I found empty cases of booze, marijuana cigarettes.
Crazy wild one.
She'd have made a preacher cuss.
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?
No refund policy.
Christmas come early.
Enjoy it.
Speaking of early, next month's quail season.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of shooting squirrels.
Me too.
- Woman: Thank you.
- Johnny: You have a pretty smile.
Did you just come here to see me?
Happy hour, boys.
Fuckin' A.
Here's to your mama.
I just want all this bullshit to be over.
No!
Woman: He's the big black guy in the red drawstring.
Man:
You're talking about the garbage man.
Woman:
Well, give the man a turkey.
- Hello.
- Earl: Yeah.
It's Earl.
- Earl.
- Yeah.
This woman leaves a message on the machine.
Barbara something or other.
Yeah, so?
She was asking about that Miss Hills.
Says no one's seen her in over a month.
Ain't that about the time she split?
Yeah.
Yeah, and you know the story.
I don't know.
I wasn't there.
I think you should call her back.
I mean, heck, Sheriff, you may have been the last one to see her.
Sheriff?
Okay, I'll call her.
Good.
You want the number?
No, it's late.
I'll get it from you in the AM.
We're still on for tomorrow, right?
Yeah, of course.
Everything all right?
Yeah, just fine.
It's gone!
Look at that.
Looks like someone spooked the cattle.
It's gone!
It's fucking gone!
Jesus, Stanley, calm the fuck down.
What's got your nuts in a sling?
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.
Maybe you accidentally ate it.
Fuck off, man, this is serious!
It had the tape in it.
What are you talking about?
The tape.
The fucking tape.
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.
I replaced it with a new one.
The Sheriff stomped on the one that had nothing on it.
You kept that tape, huh?
You kept that tape, you stupid piece of shit?
Come here.
You kept that tape?
- You kept that fucking tape?
- Please, Andy!
- Hey hey hey!
- What's wrong with you?
- How could you lose that fucking tape?
- Come on, man.
Come on.
Gotta stick together on this one.
You're too dumb to know how dumb you are.
You know that?
Uh-huh.
Is that right?
Is that right?
I better not find you, you little fucker.
All right.
All right, let's go.
Come on out, fucker.
Come on!
You think this shit's funny?
Andy?
Stanley?
Fucking pussies.
All right. All right.
That's it, God damn it.
Yeah, come on!
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Come on, fucker!
Come on out, fucker.
Oh shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Son of a bitch.
Sweetheart.
They're beautiful.
I've been so busy.
No need to explain.
You hadn't taken a single day off.
You're only human.
I guess.
Maybe you can help me with something while I put these in water.
Help with what?
I got this tape delivered, but it don't fit our machine.
What tape?
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.
Chastity see this?
No. Like I said, we couldn't get it to play.
Where is she?
She's sleeping. Why?
I'm gonna be back.
Where the hell you been?
Beauty queen over here doing his hair for two hours.
What's this all about, man?
- Where'd you get that?
- Where'd I get that?
Right there.
That's where I got that.
Somebody left me a present last night on my doorstep.
Jesus, man, Matthew!
Come on!
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.
No one knows where he's at.
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.
What?
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.
You wanna tell me why this was dropped off to my house?
To my wife!
What's on the tape?
Is this some kind of fucked up joke?
I smashed the damn thing myself!
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.
The one you smashed ain't got nothing on it.
You knew about this?
No, Sheriff,
I just found out about it myself.
Eat that tape, fat boy!
Fucking tape!
You think it's funny?
You screwed up, fat boy.
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.
I mean, dipshit there, he kept the tape as a souvenir, but Matthew's the one that took it, Sheriff.
Look at this. Silly bastard left me a present last night.
Andy:
He's obsessed with her, man.
I think he even feels guilty.
You dipshits bring him to me.
I'm gonna cut his retard pecker off and use it as a goddamn hood ornament.
That's before I'm done shoving it up your dirt hole.
Shit, we've been looking for him, Sheriff.
Trust me, we've been everywhere looking for him.
I want him found tonight.
Or I swear to Christ,
I'll bring the wrath of God down on you.
Can you believe there used to be a limit on quail?
Goddamn things are like locusts now.
Much to our good fortune.
I gotta take a break.
My dogs are barking something fierce.
I remember when you and my old man chased that buck out from the hollows on Stickler Farm before bagging it.
Aww. Them were the good old days.
To the good old days.
Well, fancy.
To what do I owe?
You just enjoy it.
This is some fine whiskey.
Usually you don't get something like this except at baptisms and weddings.
And funerals.
Loose ends, Earl.
Loose ends.
Jennifer: Matthew.
I'm over here.
Jennifer:
Matthew.
Matthew.
I- I knew- knew you were alive.
I knew it.
How did you know, Matthew?
Huh?
How did you know
I was alive?
Are you sure you're not dreaming?
Am I?
Am I dreaming?
Come here.
Sit with me.
I need to tell you-
Shh!
I know, Matthew.
I know this wasn't your fault.
You tried to help me.
I did.
I really really did.
And- and- and you're okay.
You're- you're okay.
Yes, Matthew.
Now come.
Come on.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Come on.
I'm so sorry.
Oh God!
I'm so sorry.
Matthew.
- Matthew.
- Yeah.
- Matthew, look at me.
- Yeah.
Tell me again how sorry you are.
I'm- I'm- I'm sorry.
It's just not good enough!
Stanley:
Matthew!
Matthew!
Andy:
Matthew!
Matthew!
Matthew!
Come on out, Matthew.
Matthew!
Matthew?
You're only making it harder on yourself, Matt.
Boo!
Stupid fuck, what the hell's wrong with you?
Whoo!
Fucker's playing your song.
Andy:
Your ass is grass, Matthew.
Stanley:
Matthew, you're a dead man.
Whoo!
- Come on, man.
- I'm gonna kill him.
Don't you pass out on me.
I'm too tired to drag your ass back.
What the hell?
Matthew?
Stanley:
Matthew!
God damn it, Matthew, where are you?
Where are you, you little fucker?
Andy, he ain't out here.
You little bitch.
Andy! Andy!
Andy, help me!
What the fuck, man?
- My leg!
- Ahem.
Andy!
Stanley!
Stanley, help me!
Matthew?
Help me!
Please!
Somebody!
Andy:
Stanley!
Come on, Stanley.
Matthew, this shit ain't funny, boy.
Somebody help me!
Jennifer: Smile real pretty for the camera, boy.
Andy: Please!
I know you like to watch, don't you?
Don't you, you sick fuck?
Don't worry,
I'll give you quite a show.
Andy:
Matthew!
Matthew!
- Here you go.
- Stanley!
You remember this?
Stanley, help me!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Can't talk, can you?
Maybe it's because you're hungry.
You know, you gotta eat a lot of nasty shit out here to stay alive.
Are you hungry?
You hungry?
What's wrong?
You don't like it?
What are you doing?
Some fishing.
I know how you guys like to fish.
Don't blink.
Andy:
You okay, Stan?
How's it going?
I'm sorry.
Please!
Please is what I said to you.
You said...
"Suck it, bitch. "
Does that ring any bells?
Suck... it... bitch!
Be right back.
Wait, come back.
Come back here.
Come back here.
Andy: Stanley!
I'm gonna fucking kill you, you bitch.
Hi.
You like the show so far?
Andy:
Let me out of here!
Wait.
It gets better.
Please, my eyes.
I can't take it anymore.
Oh, let me help you.
Let me out!
Stanley!
Please.
Please.
Please. Please.
That might feel better.
Andy:
Help!
Huh-uh-uh, now don't drown too soon.
Fuck you.
Now is that any way to talk to a lady?
I'm impressed.
You got a lot of fight in you.
Let's see how you do now.
What's that?
It's just some lye
I found laying around.
No!
Let's see how long you can keep that pretty little face of yours.
Fuck you!
You already did that.
I didn't enjoy it much.
Now it's my turn to fuck you.
- Please. Please.
- Oh.
Please.
Pain in the ass.
Good morning.
Whoo.
Hey there.
Can I fill you up?
It's date night.
Your mouth doesn't look so good.
Maybe you should show me your teeth.
I'll kill you.
Ornery stallion.
Guess I'm gonna have to tame you.
See, that's the problem.
You still have some teeth left.
I'm gonna have to take care of that.
Huh? Huh?
No fucking teeth, show horse.
No fucking teeth!
Better save your strength
'cause you got a few more races left to run, show horse.
That is disgusting.
Even your boys didn't piss themselves.
Look who's here.
It's my boyfriend.
Remember him?
Why don't you give him a little kiss?
Hmm? Hmm?
Let's go, come on.
I don't take orders from no fucking woman.
No?
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.
Just like it was your first time, remember?
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Let me tell you something:
You know, you weren't even a good blowjob.
No.
You know what they do to horses that can't be tamed, Johnny?
You geld them.
No teeth, show horse.
No teeth.
Bitch!
Hey, sweetheart.
- Chastity's new teacher's here.
- Storch: Mrs. Novick?
No, from the honors program.
- Do you remember anything?
- Oh yeah, that's right.
- I'm real busy, sweetheart.
- Hey, Daddy.
Hello, angel.
Daddy's real busy working.
But I really want you to meet my new teacher.
She's way cool.
Here. Just say hi.
Howdy, Sheriff.
It's truly an honor to speak with you, Miss...
Hills, Jennifer Hills.
Excuse me?
I have to tell you it's been a pleasure meeting your family.
You have a wonderful daughter with a bright and promising future.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.
No, wait!
Shit!
Chastity, where is she?
She went to Hanson Park with Miss Hills.
She wanted to get to know her students in the program before the year st-
God damn it!
Who is she?
Who is this woman?
Chastity!
Chastity!
Where are you, angel?
Chastity!
Oh no! No!
Please!
No.
Help me, Jesus.
Does that hurt, Sheriff?
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.
Where is she, you bitch?
I'd be real careful how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.
What have you done to her?
By her, I assume you mean your daughter?
She really is lovely, Sheriff.
So young.
So sweet.
So innocent.
I mean, can you imagine?
Imagine what?
Imagine that somebody had done something like this to her.
Someone like Andy.
Or Stanley or Johnny.
Or more likely you, you sick, perverted rapist!
- Deep deep deep!
- Fuck!
Deep! Deep!
Deep! Deep! Deep!
Jesus fucking Jesus.
Please.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
She's just an innocent girl.
So was I.
What are you doing? What?
Matthew.
You won't get a- fucking-way with this.
You won't get away with this!
He'll be waking up soon.
If I were you,
I'd tell him not to move.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm a God-fearing person.
I got-
I've got a baby coming, please.
Please, I'm begging you.
We can figure something out.
Sorry, Sheriff.
It was fun while it lasted.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, please.
I'm begging you to help me.
Please help me.
I've got a wife and family.
Ma'am, please!
You fuck!
You fuck!
You fuck!
Where are you going, you fuck?
I'll see you in hell!
I'll rape you in hell!
You're just a piece of meat.
I'll find you.
I'll hunt you down in hell, you bitch!
- Matthew.
- Sheriff?
- Matthew, no.
- Sheriff.
Matthew!
Some things start out big, and some things start out small, very small.
But sometimes the smallest thing... can make the biggest changes of all.
- Yar, what is it?
- I don't know.
Plio, get back here!
We don't know what it is!
Plio, be careful.
Dad, get over here.
- Zini, it's not safe.
- Oh, I always have to go when stuff's happening.
Well, what is it?
- It was an egg. Look.
- What?
- It's a cold-blooded monster from across the sea.
- Vicious, flesh-eating.
- Blech.
- Eew.
- Looks like a baby to me.
Babies grow up.
You keep that thing, one day, we'll turn our backs--
It'll be picking us out of its teeth.
- Things like that eat things like us as snacks!
- So, what do we do?
Get rid of it!
What has gotten into you?
Plio, that thing is dangerous!
I'm sorry, little one.
- Okay, get rid of it.
- Allright. I will.
You'd better hurry up, Dad.
It looks hungry.
Here.
- It's okay.
- We'll teach him to hate meat.
- Hmph.
- Watch his head.
I-I mean, watch it, he could bite.
This monster's got no teeth.
What's he gonna do?
Gum us to death?
Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.
Does that look like a monster toyou?
- Let me out! Let me out!
Hair ball.
- That was great! Get him!
Oh, no! Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!
I can't take it! There are too many of you! Come on!
Pick on someone your own size!
- Help!
Oh, no--
Aladar, you're not dead.
- No!
All right, guys, break it up.
Remember the courtship?
- You gonna miss seeing all that smooching.
-  Oh, Mom.
- That's okay, Plio.
We can smooch right here.
- It's a shame you don't like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.
Ha-ha. Go find Zini.
He's rehearsing pickup lines.
Let's hope he's found some new material.
Hey, sweetie, if you'll be my bride,
I'll groom ya.
That is good.
Oh, that's good.
Girls, I'm known as the "professor of love", and school's in session.
- Yeah, I still got it. 
- I hope it's not contagious.
- I'm a raging epidemic of romance.
- Come on, hot stuff.
Let's get goin'. You don't wanna miss
Yar's annual pep talk.
Oh, goody. I can't wait to hear the mating advice of an old monkey.
Hey-Hey-Hey, I heard that in his day, that old monkey was quite a swinger.
- You talkin' about Yar?
- Yeah, to hear him tell it, he put the "prime" in "primate".
Really?
Okay, boys, gather 'round.
Listen and learn from the master.
Now, girls, don't jump into the trees after the first boy with a cute back flip.
It's more fun if you keep them guessing.
And if a cute back flip doesn't work, guess.
You're never going to forget this day, so make it one to remember.
But if you mess up, don't worry.
They'll never remember.
Come on, guys!
We don't wanna let 'em down!
- Go on, now. Chest up! Chin up!
-  Whoo!
- Make 'em look good, son.
- Come on, Yar.
- My charm and your brains? No problem.
Ha-ha!
- Hey, girls, look what just pulled into town.
-  Hey, ladies!
- Your buffet table of love.
- Right here!Right here!
- Hey, beautiful!
Hey, free samples!
Get me while I'm hot!
Whoa!
Zini.
- Whoo! Wah-hoo!
-  Whoo!
- Yah-hoo!
- You're missin' all the action, pal. Come on.
Hey, haven't you heard?
I am the action!
Ah, don't worry, Zini.
You always have next year.
Hey, I'm lucky to be rid of them.
With the ladies,
- before you know it, they all wanna move to a bigger tree.
- Hmm.
Oh, well. Poor Zini.
The clan still has one bachelor.
No, we have two.
Well, it's never really been his best event.
He's got a tougher hide than mine.
- Oh, Aladar, if only there was someone on the island for you.
Well, you know, who looks like you, but prettier.
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?
Whoa!
- What are they?
- I don't know.
Dad?
Something's wrong.
Aladar, where's Suri?
- She's up in the tree.
Come on! Go! Go!
Come on!
-Mom!
- Suri!
- Mom! Mom!
- Suri!
- Mom!
-  Suri, where are you?
Run, Aladar!
Run! Run!
- Yar, come on!
- Zini, jump! Jump!
-  Zini, jump!
- Hold on!
Plio! Yar! Where are you?
Aladar, over here!
I feel bad. I feel bad.
Oh, Suri.
Easy, easy.
They're all gone.
- Shh, shh. I'm here.
Come on.
We can't stay here.
Now, now, Suri.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Look!
- Whoa!
- Did you see that?
-  What?
-  I did.
-  Me too!
-  Where did it go?
- I don't know. Let's go see.
- Leave it alone. Hey!
-  Shh, Dad.
-  It's scaring Suri.
-  No, it's not.
Everyone just be quiet.
-  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-  Yar, grab on!
-  I can't reach!
-  Aladar, they're stopping!
- Huh?
Stay out of my way!
You heard Kron.
Move it!
- Watch it.
-  Zini, get your head down.
Walkin' backwards, huh?
Well, let me know if that gets you there any faster.
Keep those little legs movin;
Url, or you'll get left behind.
Look at all the Aladars.
- If you're even thinking of joining them--
- Hang on! Hang on!
-Kron, there is a more protected spot further down the--
- We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.
Oh, Eema, I wish we were at your nesting grounds now.
All this pushing and shoving about, just for a place to sleep.
I'm not used to this kind of behavior.
- Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick. Git!
Ooh, I couldn't possibly.
Shoo, shoo.
Will you come on, Baylene?
You wanna get to the nesting grounds alive?
- Show some backbone.
- Hey, there.
- Oh, sorry about that.
Uh, it'sjust, we overheard you talking, and, um--
Well, my word.
Look at Uri.
- He doesn't normally warm up to strangers so fast.
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath'd clear those right up.
- Excuse me?
Um, he's my grandfather, couple of times removed.
Try a couple of species removed.
Uh, my name's Aladar.
This is my family.
We're all that's left.
Oh, my dear.
I'm so sorry.
Baylene's the last ofher kind.
Finding stragglers like her all along the way.
I heard you say something about nesting grounds?
It is the most beautiful place there is, child.
It's where the herd goes to have their babies.
Will we find anybody that looks like us there?
Oh, the last few days,
I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.
Who knows what we'll find.
The hard job now is just getting there.
- And we're being driven unmercifully.
- By who?
Kron, the herd's head honcho.
We can hardly keep up.
An older woman like myself--
It's-- Well, it's positively indecent.
- Then tell him.
What's the worst he can do?
Oh!
- Hey!
What's his problem?
- That's him, honey. Kron.
- Huh.
- Uh, excuse me!
Kron, you got a second?
- Get lost, kid.
- Hmm. Relax, Bruton.
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.
Why aren't you uphill with the-- uh, young bloods?
- Well, I was back here talking to these guys.
- I guess they--
They're having a hard time keeping up.
- So, you know, maybe you could slow it down a bit?
Hmm. Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there's an idea.
Better let me do the thinking from now on, Aladar.
- Hey, they need help back here.
- Hmm.
Watch yourself, boy.
Don't worry. That's how my brother treats newcomers, no matter how charming they are.
You sure know how to catch a girl's eye, there, stud.
I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye if I was you, especially Neera's.
You just keep your head down, and you mind what Kron tells you.
Since when do we take orders from the likes of him?
Kron has swatted flies bigger than you, pops.
I could hold that monster's brain in the palm of my--
No, Yar, she's right.
Better to keep our heads down with this bunch...
- than get 'em bitten off by those things.
Well, you just consider yourself lucky that's all that's following us.
- Hey, wake up.
- Enough with the beauty sleep.
You're ravishing already.
Hey! Hello!
Anybody in there?
Zini, what are you doing?
I believe you left a wake-up call for the dawn of time.
- Come on! Move it!
- What's the hurry?
Something's up.
The herd's gathering without us.
Let's check it out.
Rise and shine!
Kron says everybody goes.
- Come on. Get up. On your feet.
Huh. The charm never stops around here.
You say something?
Uh, no-- no, sir.
Unless you got a death wish, you and that little parasite better get moving!
Sheesh, is that guy ugly or what?
Hey, hey, hey, there's your girlfriend.
- What are you talkin' about?
- You know what
I'm talkin' about: Neera.
Scaly skin. Yellow eyes. Big ankles.
Yeah, I made a real impression on her.
What you need is a little help from the love monkey.
- "The love monkey"?
- Ow, baby!
Ow!
- That, children,
- is what's known as a "jerkasaurus".
- And with that, the ice is broken.
We've got a lot of first-timers here.
Make sure they get it.
We stop for nothing and no one.
If this is your first crossing, listen up.
- There is no water till we reach the other side.
And you'd better keep up,
'cause if a predator catches you, you're on your own. Move out!
-  Oh, my goodness.
- It looks like a very long walk.
-And hot.
If you smell somethin' sizzlin', it could be me.
We're moving too slow.
I'll pick up the pace.
Hey, old girl, you're wandering off a bit.
That's all I need: a monkey on my back.
- On your feet, Eema.
We can't let those things eat you.
They're out there waiting.
- The lake!
-  We made it?
It's just over that-- that hill, baby.
Oh, thank goodness.
Come on, Eema.
Water. Remember water?
Oh, it's time to refresh my memory.
I'm just gonna walk right into that lake...
- until the water's up tomy eyeballs... and soak it all in.
Maybe the rains collected somewhere else.
What do you want us to do?
Take a scout and check the entire perimeter.
- Enough! You have to be strong now.
The nesting grounds are only a few days away. Keep moving!
- Kron, we've never gone this long without water.
If we keep going like this, we'll lose half the herd.
Then we save the half that deserves to live.
What? They're moving already?
Oh-Ho, we'll never keep up.
There was water here, always water here before.
We always had water, always.
- And-- And plenty of mud. 
- Oh, Eema, please.
The herd won't wait.
We must carry on.
- You gotta get up.
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.
- Baylene, don't move.
- What is it?
What's wrong?
- Doyou hear that?
- I sure do. Lift your foot, Baylene.
Ooh!
- Now press down.
I always did like big girls!
- Water!
- Oh, my goodness!
- Water! Come on!
- He found water.
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.
Kron, look.
All we had to do is dig, and--
Good. Now, get out of the way.
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!
Ah!
- Oh.
- Eema!
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.
Bruton, we've been walking in circles.
There's no water here.
- I think we should get back.
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Let's get out of here.
Now, you come out on three.
One, two, three!
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.
Hey, hey.
What's going on?
The little Aladars haven't had anything to drink.
I think they're scared of me.
Who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.
-  Come on over, guys.
- Take it easy. Don't worry.
She's just a hair ball.
- And proud of it.
Come on. He's gonna find you some water.
Here. Now, you just take a foot and press.
- Whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on. Come on. Knock it off.
Let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork. Ready?
One, two, three. Press!
Good job, Suri.
- So, where are your parents, anyway?
-A lot of us are on our own now.
You like kids, I see.
- Well, the skinny ones can be a little chewy.
I'm Aladar... the "jerkasaurus".
Ohh. Sorry about that.
You're probably right.
-  Dad, wake up.
-  Huh?
Why did you help that old one?
What else could we do?
Leave her behind?
Oh. You mean, you actually--
Well, that happens all the time.
- You don't survive if you're not--
- Strong enough.
Well... yeah.
Is that you talking, or your brother?
Everything's so different.
I-I don't know what to think anymore.
Look, Neera-- we watch out for each other, we all stand a chance of getting to your nesting grounds.
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not, but it's all I know.
So, um-- Oh, water.
I'll, uh, get you some water.
- Can I try it?
- Sure. Just press.
- Hmm.
-  Oops.
- Sorry.
- No. You-- You first.
One down... and, well, one down.
Kron!
- Carnotaurs!
- What? They never come this far north.
The fireball must've driven them out.
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them with your hide!
Move the herd out, double-time!
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.
Kron, what's going on?
Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving, they'll catch up to us.
But the others in the back--
They'll never make it.
They'll slow down the predators.
You can't sacrifiice them like this!
- Hold it! That could be you back there! Or you!
If you ever interfere again,
I'll kill you.
Stay away from him!
Ooh.
Aladar, no.
You just--just go. I'll be okay.
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!
- Carno-what?
-Carnotaur.
A mouthful of teeth with a bad attitude. Let's go.
Come on, you guys! Get on! Get on!
We're gonna get left behind.
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!
Aladar, slow down.
Oh, joy. Blisters.
I've got blisters on my blisters.
- You don't wanna know where I got blisters.
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.
- Okay, what's the worst thing it could be?
- A carnotaur.
- What's the second-worst thing it could be?
- Two carnotaurs! Oh!
- That's it. I'm gone.
-  Oh, my goodness!
Everybody, we don't know for sure.
It could be the herd.
- Let's check it out.
- Oh, my goodness.
Goodness gracious.
Oh, it's Bruton.
It appears we weren't the only ones left behind.
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs. We should keep moving.
- We can't just leave him here.
- We can if we move fast enough.
Hey, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.
Now, get away from me.
- Suit yourself.
- Hmm?
If you change your mind, we'll be in those caves.
Mm.
It's dark, but at least it's dry.
- I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.
Ouch!
Ooh. Sorry, Url.
Sturdy little thing, ain't he?
- Ahem. We appear to have a visitor.
You coming in or what?
What is it with you?
At least I know enough to get in out of the rain.
Now, come on.
On your feet.
- Uh, you can lie down with us. It's warmer.
May I remind you that he's one of them ?
Well, looks like he's one of us now.
Ahh. Who booked this trip, anyway?
Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds soon enough.
Well, when I get there,
I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.
- You tell him, Eema.
If I could sleep that deep,
I'd be in paradise.
If you could sleep that deep, honey, you'd be dead.
This plant grew on our island.
It will make you feel better.
Ahh.
Why is he doing this?
Pushing them on with false hope?
It's hope that's gotten us this far.
But why doesn't he let them accept their fate?
I've accepted mine.
- And what is your fate?
- To die here.
It's the way things are.
Only if you give up,
Bruton.
It's your choice, not your fate.
Well, the plant will help.
-Shh.
Carnotaurs.
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.
Oh.
- Ooh.
-  Go! Go!
Hurry!
Move it, Eema!
Oh!
-  Aladar!
Aladar! Oh, no!
- I'll hold them off!.
You help the others!
Bruton!
Bruton! No!
Bruton!
You did what you could.
It's okay, little ones.
We're going to make it.
Okay, okay.
Let's do it again. Let's do it again.
- Uh, I spy with my little eye--
- A rock.
You got it again!
Ooh! You are good!
Well, I'll tell you what I spy.
A dead end.
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.
Hold on a moment.
- Zini, what is it?
- Do you smell that?
-  Yeah.
Get a load of that.
-  Good show.
Everybody stand back.
We're outta here!
Aladar, look out!
No!
Aladar, we'll go back.
Back to what?
It's gone.
We're not meant to survive.
Oh, yes, we were.
We're here, aren't we?
And how dare you waste that good fortune by simply giving up?
Shame on you.
Shame on you! Shame on you!
The worst of it is, you allowed an old fool like me to believe I was needed-- that I still had a purpose-- and do you know what?
You were right.
And I'm going to go on believing it.
And I, for one, am not willing to die here.
Oh, dear.
The nesting grounds.
It's-- It's untouched.
Our new home.
- And it comes with a pool!
- Yodelay-yodelay- yodelay heehoo
Cannonball!
Whoo-hoo-ha-ha!
Ha. Amateur.
Look out below!
- Not bad. But I don't get it.
Where's the herd?
- Not to mention Neera.
They'll get here--
Mm. Soon enough.
Oh, no.
Eema?
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?
That is the way we used to get in here.
They'll never make it over that.
Aladar, wait! Wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.
Let him try.
Mm. I hope Kron's in a listening mood.
Stay here.
We'll find a way around it.
In the morning, we'll climb it.
We have to keep trying.
Our survival, our future, is over these rocks.
Now, let's go home!
You'll make it, won't you, boys?
- No.
- Watch them. They're tough!
If they can do it, so can you!
- Kron!
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur is coming!
- Keep moving!
-Stop!
- I've been to the valley!
There's a safer way!
- Go on! Show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where, straight to the carnotaurs?
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!
There's a sheer drop on the other side!
You're gonna kill the herd!
I know a way to the valley, and everybody can make it!
- Now, follow me!
- Kron!
They're staying with me!
All right. Let's go!
Neera!
He's led that monster right to us! This way!
- No! Don't move!
If we scatter, he'll pick us off!.
Stand together!
Kron!
- No. No.
Kron.
Welcome home.
Move over, everybody.
Bringing in babies is what I do best.
I'd say it's been a few years since you've hatched an egg.
- You're right, so let me practice on your head.
Look! Somebody wants to meet you.
Ohh! Aren't you the sweetest little small fry I ever did see?
Hey, little guy.
He looks just like me.
Meet your dad.
He's not as crazy as he looks.
-Ohh. Oh, happy day.
- Well done, little one.
Come here, you little rascal.
Let me get a good look at you.
Yep. You're your father's son, all right.
- Hey!
Look what I found! New neighbors!
Any of you ladies up for a game of "monkey in the middle"?
- Easy, now! Easy! Hey!
None of us really know what changes, big or small, lie ahead.
One thing is certain--
Our journey's not over.
We can only hope that in some small way... our time here will be remembered.
[ Bird Chirping ]

[ Gasps ]
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm lost !
Where's the line ?
Itjust went away.
What do I do ?
- Help !
- We'll be stuck here forever !
Do not panic.
Do not panic !
We are trained professionals.
Now, stay calm.
We are going around the leaf.
A-Around the leaf?
I don't think we can do that.
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing compared to the twig of'93.
- [ Whimpering ]
- That's it. That's it. Good !
You're doing great !
There you go. There you go !
Watch my eyes.
Don't look away.
- And here's the line again.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Soil.
[ Laughing ]
Good job, everybody !
Oh, my.
There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil.
- Shouldn't we tell the queen ?
- I don't think we need to involve the queen in this.
She's got enough on her plate already, training her daughter.
Oh, yes.
Princess Atta, the poor dear.
Oh, wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.
-Just be confident, dear.
You'll be fine.
- [ Gasps ] There's a gap.
There's a gap in the line.
What are we gonna do ?
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.
We just lost a few inches, that's all.
Oh. Right.
Your Highness, I can't count when you hover like that.
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- Guys, go shade someone else for a while.
- [ Pet Chirps ]
Okay, Atta.
Now what do we do ?
Ahh-- Oh ! Don't tell me.
I know it. What is it ?
- We relax.
- [ Chuckles ] Right.
Oh, it'll be fine.
It's the same, year after year.
They come, they eat, they leave.
That's our lot in life.
It's not a lot, but it's our life.
[ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ]
Isn't that right, Aphie ?
Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.
[ Rumbling ]
- Ditch Dot !
- Yeah, yeah !
Hey, come back here !
[ Strains, Grunts ]
- Dot.!
- Yes, Mother.
What did I tell you about trying to fly ?
Not until my wings grow in.
- Right.
- But Mom--
Dot, you're a young queen ant and your wings are too little--
I was talking to Mother.
You're not the queen yet, Atta.
Now, Dot, be nice to your sister.
It's not my fault she's so stressed out.
[ Sighs ]
I know, I know.
- I'm always acting like the sky is falling.
- Look out.!
- Atta !
- Princess Atta !
- Oh !
- Hey !
-Stop that.!
- What do you think you're doing?
- You could have killed somebody over here.
- [ Gasps ] I'm sorry !
- Oh, it's Flik.
- Oh--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry !
- Please forgive me. I'm sorry !
- [ Coughing ]
- [ Screams ] Princess Atta !
- Flik, what are you doing ?
Oh, this ! This is my new idea for harvesting grain.
No more picking individual kernels.
You cut down the entire stalk !
- We don't have time for this.
- Exactly ! We never have time to collect food for ourselves.
We spend all summer harvesting for the offering.
- But my invention will
speed up production.
- Oh, another invention ?
Something for you too.
Since you're gonna be queen, you could use this to oversee production.
- Dr. Flora, if I may.
- This is all very nice, but--
-Just an ordinary blade of grass and a bead of dew, right ?
- Flik, please.
- Wrong ! It is, in fact, a telescope.
- [ Both Laugh ]
- It's very clever, Flik, but--
- Hello, Princess ! Aren't you looking lovely this morning !
Not that you would need a telescope to see that.
Listen ! The princess doesn't have time for this !
You wanna help fill this thing ?
Get rid of that machine, get back in line and pick grain like everybody else !
- Like everybody else !
- Please, Flik.Just go.
I'm sorry,
I was really just trying-- trying to help.
Harvester. Why, we harvested
the same way ever since I was a pupa.
[ Sighs ]
Where were we ?
- The food pile, Your Highness.
- Oh,yes,yes.
Hey, Flik ! Wait up !
Oh. Hello, Princess.
You can call me Dot.
Here, you forgot this.
Thanks. You can keep it.
I can make another one.
- I like your inventions.
- Really ? Well, you're the first.
- I'm beginning to think nothing I do works.
- This works.
Great. One success.
[ Sighs ]
- I'm never gonna make a difference.
- Me, neither.
I'm a royal ant and I can't even fly yet. I'm too little.
- Being little's not such a bad thing.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
- Is too !
- Is not. Is not ! Is not !
- Is too. Is too ! Is too !
Oh ! A seed.
I need a seed. Ahh--
Ohh !
Ah, here, here.
Pretend-- pretend that that's a seed.
- It's a rock.
- I know it's a rock.
But let's just pretend for a minute it's
a seed. We'll just use our imaginations.
Now, do you see our tree ?
Everything that made that giant tree... is already contained inside this tiny little seed.
All it needs is some time, a little bit of sunshine and rain, and... voila !
This rock will be a tree ?
Seed to tree. You've gotta work with me, all right ?
You might not feel like you can do much now, but that's just because, well, you're not a tree yet.
You just have to give yourself some time. You're still a seed.
But it's a rock.
I know it's a rock !
Don't ya think I know a rock when I see a rock ? I've spent a lot of time around rocks !
You're weird, but I like you.

- [ Horn Continues ]
[ Panicked Chattering ]
- They're coming !
- Run !
- Dot ! Dot !
- Mom !
- Mom !
- Thank heavens !
- Food to the offering stone.
- [ Whistles ] Everyone, single file.
Food to the offering stone and into the anthill. Now let's go !
Go, go, go, go !
Come on, keep movin', keep movin' !
Good. [ Panting ]
Okay. That's everyone.
[ Flik ]
Hey.!
Hey, wait for me !
Get the food to the offering stone, then into the anthill.
[ Screams ]
No ! No, no, no, no, no !
Oh, oh !
Oh, no.
Princess Atta !
Princess Atta !
Princess Atta !
[ Rumbling ]
[ Whimpering ]
They come, they eat, they leave.
They come, they eat, they leave.
Excuse me, pardon me.
Pardon me, excuse me. Coming through.
Sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta, there's something I need to tell you.
- Not now, Flik. Shh !
- But Your Highness, it's about the offering !
-[ Rumbling Stops ]
-[ Male Voice ] Hey, what's goin'on ?
Yeah, where's the food?
[ All Gasp ]
- What did you do ?
- It was an accident ?
[ Laughs Maniacally ]
Boo !
[ Laughs ]
- Where's the food ?
- [ Whimpering ]
- Hopper.
- [ Gasps ]
So, where is it ?
Where's my food ?
- l-l-Isn't it up there ?
- What ?
- The food was in a leaf sitting on top--
- Excuse me.
Are you sure it's not up there ?
- Are you saying I'm stupid ?
- No.
Do I look stupid... to you ?
Let's just think about the logic, shall we? Think about it for a second.
If it was up there, would I be coming down here, to your level, looking for it ?
- Uh, l--
- Why am I even talking to you ?
You're not the queen.
You don't smell like the queen.
Sh-She's learning
to take over for me, Hopper.
Oh, I see. Under new management.
So it's your fault.
No, it wasn't me, it was--
Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership:
Everything is your fault.
- But-But l--
- It's a bug-eat-bug world out there, Princess, one of those circle-of-life kind of things.
Now, let me tell you
how things are supposed to work.
The sun grows the food, the ants pick the food, the grasshoppers eat the food--
And the birds eat the grasshoppers.
Hey, like the one that nearly ate you, you 'member ? Oh, you shoulda seen it.
This blue jay has him halfway down his throat, and Hopper's kickin' and screamin'.
And I'm scared.
I'm not goin'anywhere near, okay?
Aw, come on.
It's a great story. Ow, ow, ow.
I swear, if I hadn't promised
Mother on her deathbed... that I wouldn't kill you,
I would kill you.
- And believe me, no one appreciates that more than I do.
- Shut up !
I don't want to hear another word out of you while we're on this island.
- Do you understand me ?
- [ Whimpers ]
- I said, do you understand me ?
- How can I answer ? You said
I couldn't say another word.
- Remember Ma !
- [ Growls ]
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.
There's still a few months till the rains come, so you can all just try again.
But, Hopper, since it's
almost the rainy season, we need this time to gather food for ourselves.
Listen, if you don't keep your end of the bargain, then I can't guarantee your safety.
And there are insects out there that will take advantage of you.
Someone could get hurt.
[ Snaps Fingers ]
[ Screeching ]
[ Snarling, Screeching ]
[ Gasps, Squeals ]
What's the matter ?
You scared of grasshoppers ?
[ Whimpering ]
- Dot !
- You don't like Thumper ?
- [ Snarls ]
- Leave her alone !
You want her ?
Go ahead-- take her.
No ?
Then get back in line.
It seems to me that you ants are forgetting your place.
So let's double the order of food.
- [ Gasps ]
- No ! But-But--
We'll be back at the end of the season, when the last leaf falls.
You ants have a nice summer.
Let's ride !
- Yee-ha !
- [ Grasshoppers Shouting ]
[ Laughing ]
Ooh !
[ Chuckles Nervously ]
Flik, what do you have to say for yourself?
Sorry. l-- I'm sorry for the way I am.
I didn't mean for things to go so wrong.
I especially didn't want to make you look bad, Princess.
- Well, Flik, ya did.
- I was just trying to help.
- Then help us-- don't help us.
- Help, help. Help?
Flik, you are sentenced to one month digging in the tunnels.
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Need I remind you of Flik's tunnel-within-a-tunnel project ?
Helpers to help us.
That's it ! We could--
It took two days to dig him out.
Send him to Health and Ant Services.
Heavens, no !
We could leave the island, the river bed's dry.
We could walk across and get helpers.
We could ! We could go find helpers to help us.
- It's perfect !
- Perfect ? What's so perfect ?
Your Highness, don't you see ?
We could send someone to get help !
- [ All Gasp ]
- Leave the island ?
Why didn't I think of that ?
Oh ! Because it's suicide !
-She's right! We never leave the island.
-Never leave !
There's snakes and birds and bigger bugs out there !
Exactly ! Bigger bugs !
We could find bigger bugs to come here and fight... and forever rid us of Hopper and his gang !
- Ludicrous!
- Who would do a crazy thing like that?
- I'll volunteer.
I'd be happy to volunteer.
- [ Laughing ]
You got a lot of spunk, kid, but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.
At least we could try. I could travel to the city ! I could search there !
If you went, you'd be on that silly search for weeks.
Royal huddle.
- Great idea, Princess. It's perfect !
- Exactly.
- Wait a minute.
What did we just decide here ?
- To let Flik leave.
While we keep harvesting to meet Hopper's demands.
- You see, with Flik gone, he can't--
- He can't mess anything up !
Flik, after much deliberation, we have decided to grant you your request.
- Really ?
- Really ?
- Uh, really.
Oh, thank you, Princess.
Thank you so much for this chance.
- I won't let you down,
I promise, I promise, I promise.
- That's fine. No, forget it.
- I should help repair the damage before I go.
- [ All ] No ! No, no !
[ Elderly Ant ]
Just leave.!
[ Breathes Deeply ]
Hey.
Don't worry !
The colony is in good hands !
Bye, now.
[ Ants Cheering ]
All right.
Hey, fellas.
Beautiful mornin', huh ?
My dad gives you one hour before you come back crying.
Does he, now ?
- My dad doesn't think that.
- He doesn't, huh ?
- Naw, he's bettin' you're gonna die.
- Oh.
He says if the heat doesn't get ya, the birds will.
I think he's gonna make it.
-Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
-Yeah, Dot. What do you know?
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up. Come on.
She's entitled to her opinion too.
[ Gasps ]
[ Birds Cawing ]
Ohh.
- So go, already.
- [ Exhales ]
- Hey !
- The city's that way.
- I know.
- You're supposed to look for bugs, not dandelions.
You leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.
That's right.
Here I go. For the colony, and for oppressed ants everywhere !
Whoa-oh.
- Wow !
- Hey.!
- Hey-hey !
- Bye, Flik !
Wow !
[ Chuckling ]
Wow. Ohh !
Whoa !
[ Dot ]
Good luck, Flik !
Bye ! Whoa-oh !
Flik !
[ Muffled ]
I'm... okay !
- Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
- You just watch.
He's gonna get the bestest, roughest bugs you've ever seen !
[ Growls, Roars ]
Get back ! Get back !
Get back, you horrible beast !
- [ Roaring ]
- I have no fear ! Aye-eee !
- Ooh !
- Oh, my goodness.
- [ Sobbing ]
- Oh, no !
[ Crowd Boos, Hisses ]
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie ?
- Owie ! Owie, owie.
Please show Rosie the owie.
All right, Dim. It's okay.
I have been in outhouses that didn't stink that bad.
This is ridiculous.
What a disappointment !
- Oh, no!
- You! Come here! I want my money back!
Uh, no refunds after the first two minutes.
Popcorn ! Stale popcorn !
We're losin' the audience !
You clowns get out there now !
- I hate performing on an empty stomach!
- Do your act, Heimlich.
- Then you can eat. Not now, Slim.
- P.T., what's the point ?
What's the point of going out there ?
They'll only laugh at me.
- That's because you're a clown !
- No, it's because I'm a prop !
You always cast me as the broom, the pole, the stick, a splinter.
You're a walkingstick.
It's funny !
- Now go !
- You parasite.
Tra-la-la-la-la.
Spring's in the air.
And I'm a flower with nothing interesting to say.
- [ Screams ]
- A bee !
I am a cute little bumblebee !
Here I come !
[ Screams ]
Slow down, you flowers !
[ Groans ]
Candy corn ! Here, let me help you to finish it.
Hey, cutie ! Wanna pollinate with a real bug ? [ Laughs ]
Ooh, come to papa.!
So, bein' a ladybug automatically makes me a girl, is that it, flyboy ? Huh ?
- She's a guy !
- Francis, leave them alone.
- They are poo-poo heads !
- Not again.
Judging by your breath, you must have been buzzin' around a dung heap all day.
- Come on, Francis.
You're making the maggots cry.
- [ Wailing ]
** [ Vocalizing ]
All right, we're dyin' out there.
Gypsy, quick ! You and Manny--
- Shh ! He's in a trance.
- [ Humming ]
Well, get him out of it !
You and your husband are up now.
Manny, we're on.
Oh ? Yet again it is up to me to rescue the performance.
- Gypsy, come.
- ** [ Humming ]
[ Crashing ]
- The stage is the other way, dear.
- Yes, of course.
Anytime, pal !
- I'm gonna pick the hairs out of your head one by one !
- Take your best shot !
- You name the place !
- Oh, yeah ?
- Yeah, 'cause when you get there, you are dead !
- Francis, let me handle this.
- That's no way to speak to a lady.
- I heard that, you twig.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Manto the Magnificent... and his lovely assistant, Gypsy !
From the most mysterious regions of uncharted Asia,
I give you the Chinese Cabinet... of Metamorphosis !
Rosie, whole troupe.
Onstage ! Finale ! Now !
- Okay, I just need time to--
Coming, coming.
- Now.!
Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys.
We're up next.
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]
Don't you understand ?
We are up !
- " Up-a."
- [ Chattering ]
- Hey !
- Hey ! They don't understand me.
I summon the voice of Confucius--
Get off the stage,
you old hack.!
[ Shrieks ]
I demand to know who said that !
- [ Laughing ]
- How dare you !
Ingrates !
[ Gypsy ]
Manny? Manny.!
I only got 24 hours to live and I ain't gonna waste it here.
Come on.
[ Screams ] I've just about had it with these losers !
Flaming death !
I hold in my hand the match-- the match that decides whether two bugs live or die this very evening.
In a moment, I will light
this trail of matches...
leading to a sheet offlypaper
dowsed in lighter fluid.!
Aimed directly at the flypaper are Tuck and Roll,
the pill bug cannonballs.!
The cannon
will be triggered by Dim,
trained tojump
at the sound of this bell...
set to go off in 15 seconds.
Our pill bugs'only hope
of survival is... our mistress of the high wire, Rosie !
Secured to a web line
of exact length,
Rosie will plummet down
to these two posts, spinning a web of safety in less than 15 seconds !
Not good enough, you say ?
Well, what if they were all... blindfolded !
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I suggest that those of you... with weak constitutions leave the arena,
- for this act is so dangerous...
- [ Bickering ] that if the slightest thing should go wrong--
- No !
- Go ? Okay, through the tunnel--
- Whoa !
- [ Bell Dings ]
- [ Chuckling ]
- Whoa !
- [ Screams ]
- P.T. !
- Oh, no !
- Oh !
- [ Whimpering ]
- Water ! We need some water !
- Water, water, water !
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Grunting ]
Get me outta here !
Oof!
[ Laughs ]
- [ Laughing ]
- Wow !
- It's the web. I'm sorry.
- You're all fired.
- We got the water !
- Here we come, P.T. !
Whoo ! Whoa !
Burn 'im again !
No, Harry, no !
Don't look at the light !
I can't help it !
It's so beautiful !
[ Screams ]
Try not to look like a country bug.
Blend-- blend in.
[ Male Voice ]
Hey, buggy.!
What do you expect ?
The guy's a tick.
Wow.! The city.!
[ Laughing ]
Wow !
Whoa-whoa-whoa !
Making all stops to the septic tank,
including standing water, empty bean can and dead rat.
- Watch your stingers. All aboard.!
- Whoa !
- Hey ! Oh, sorry.
- Get out of the way !
- Watch where you're goin' !
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
- [ Violin Sound ]
- [ Gasps ] Oh, sorry !
Oh. I'm really, really sorry.
That was an-an-an ac-ac-accident.
- Hey, let go of me !
- I'll show ya who's tough !
- And stay out !
- Tough bugs !
- I knew an old lady who swallowed a fly--
- Wow !
- Move it !
- Whoa !
[ Male Fly ]
Hey, waiter.! I'm in my soup.!
I've been workin'out.
Feel my wing.
Yo !
Two Black Flags over here !
- All right.
- Hair of the dog you bit.
Hey, who ordered the pu-pu platter ?
Here ya go, slick. Enjoy.
Ow ! Aah !
Hey, I said no salt !
Pardon me, sir.
I represent a colony of ants, and I'm looking for tough bugs, you know, mean bugs--
Fired by a flea-- how humiliating !
Let's face it: We stink.
- You fired !
- You fired !
- Oh, will you shut up ?
- You fired !
Someday I will be a beautiful butterfly, and then everything will be better.
I can't believe the troupe is breaking up. We've always been together.
- Farewell, my friends.
- To the audience we'll never have.
[ Gasps ] Francis ! Your boyfriends from the circus are here !
- [ Gasps ]
- There she is.
- Hello there, girly bug.
- Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.
Say, why don't you tell our pal, Thud,
- what you said to us at the circus.
- Yeah.
- Somethin' about buzzin' around a dung heap ?
- [ Growls ]
Excuse me. Hi. I represent an ant colony, and we're--
Hey, bartender !
Bloody Mary, O-positive.
Aha !
- [ Sighs ]
- Sir ?
* Ladybug, ladybug fly away home *
- [ Laughs ]
- Not so tough now, are you ?
All right, clown.
Get up and fight like a girl.
- Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
- I want to be LittleJohn !
- What part can I play ?
- You see, I'm looking for tough, warrior bugs.
Stand back,ye flies.! We are
the greatest warriors in all bugdom.!
- Warrior bugs !
- My sword !
Swish, swish. Clang, clang.
- LittleJohn ?
- What ho, Robin ?
Justice is my sword and truth shall be my quiver !
Wait, wait ! No, no !
I want to watch this !
-Jawohl.!
- Thrust, parry, lunge !
- [ Growls ]
- Me thinketh it's not working !
[ Gasps ]
Back to Sherwood Forest !
- Schnell ! Schnell !
- What's going on in there ?
[ All Screaming ]
Help ! Help ! Get me out !
[ Grunting ]
Wow.
- Oh, ow-ow-ow-ow.
-[ Flik ] You're perfect.!
Oh, great ones ! I have been scouting for bugs with your exact talents !
- [ Gasps ] A talent scout.
- My colony's in trouble.
Grasshoppers are coming ! We've been forced to prepare all this food.
- Dinner theater !
- Food ?
Please !
Will you help us ?
- [ Growling ]
- Where are they ?
- We'll take the job !
- Really ?
- Yes, yes, yes !
You can explain the details on the way.
Hey !
[ Chattering ]
- Okay, come on, everyone. Break a leg !
- Whoa, you're vicious !
Hold on, Mr. Ant.
Amazing !
This is too good to be true !
[ Laughs ]
Ooh !
So, you see, it was my fault that Hopper's coming back.
But then, Princess Atta-- boy, is she one in a million-- she let me go out and find you.
And after seeing you fight off those flies--
Boy, are those grasshoppers in for a surprise !
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Chattering In
Foreign Language ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Moans ]
- Dr. Flora !
- Oh, dear. Not another one.
- This is insane.
- Insane.
There's just not enough food left on the island !
No way we can make double quota before Hopper comes.
Well, we have to try, Thorny.
We don't have any choice.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, look who's playing
lookout again--little Speck.!
- The name is Dot.
- Well, Spot, still lookin' for Flik ?
Forget it, Dot.
That loser's never coming back.
Flik.!
He did it.! He did it.!
What ? Quit shoving !
This is it !
This is Ant Island !
Flik ! Over here !
Flik ! Flik !
- Hey !
- He did it ! He did it ! Yea !
- He did it !
- Cool ! [ Screams ]
At the rate these leaves are dropping, we're gonna need a miracle.
That's right !
We need a miracle !
- Run for your lives !
- [ Anxious Chattering ]
Ta-da !
[ Bird Cawing ]
[ Sighing ] Once again, our reputation precedes us.
Hey, everybody !
Hey ! I'm back !
Hey, guys.! Hey-ey.!
Look-look-look who's here with me.!
Flik ! Flik ! Flik ! You're back !
I knew you could do it !
- Flik ?
- It's Flik !
[ Chattering ]
- Flik has returned !
- He's back ?
And he's accompanied by savage insects !
What ? How ? He wasn't supposed to actually find someone !
Oh, look at this.
This is great. Look.
- Oh, my ticker !
- So, what are you supposed to be ?
He's a stick, stupid.
You hit bugs with him.
- Well, that's an oversimplification.
- That's right, kids. Like this !
- No ! Put me down !
- Ow !
- Hey !
- My, you just pop right open there, dontcha ?
- Ooh ! Wow !
- Uh-oh. Kids, He's kinda ticklish.
- [ Laughing ]
- Let's come on out. Careful.
[ Laughs ]
Well, my boy, you came through.
- Aphie and I are very impressed.
- [ Aphie Barks ]
Princess Atta! Hey, guys, Princess Atta!
She's the one that sent me to find you!
- Did you see that really big bug over there ?
- He looks absolutely ferocious !
- They're our ticket out of this mess !
- They came just in time !
So, Princess Atta, what do you think ?
No-no-no, wait !
This was not supposed to happen.
Mayday, Mayday.
We're losin' the job.
We don't fight grasshoppers.
- We don't, but they will.
- Bingo !
We gotta sweeten the deal.
Your Majesty, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls of all ages, our troupe here guarantees a performance like no other !
Why, when your grasshopper friends get here, we are gonna... knock them dead !
[ Cheering ]
Boy, these folks are sure hard up for entertainment.
Come on, come on. Hurry.!
[ Panting ]
Wow !
** [ Lively Dance Beat ]
Honey, relax.
You should be proud of yourself.
- Your instincts on that boy were right on the money.
- [ Chuckles ]
** [ Music Ends ]
And to make our official welcome complete-- Mr. Soil ?
- Yes, Your Highness ?
- He's our resident thespian.
Last year he played the lead in Picnic. [ Laughs ]
The children-- and myself-- have quickly put together... a little presentation in honor of our guests.
Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub ?
Oh, aren't they adorable !
Ooh, they're cute !
The South Tunnel Elementary School second grade class... would like to present you with this, a mural we have drawn... of you bugs helping us fight the grasshoppers away.
Oh, look at the beautiful colors of the blood.
We drew one of you dying because our teacher said it would be more dramatic.
- [ Gasps ]
-[ Ants Applauding ]
- [ Playing Harp ]
- I tell you a tale of heroes so bold, who vanquished our grasshopper enemies of old.
Look, the last leaf has fallen.
[ Together] We are the grasshoppers !
Where's our food ?
Who will come to save us poor ants ?
We are the warriors, here to defend you !
I die.! Die.! Die.!
[ Cheering ]
- [ Chattering ]
- Thank you, thank you ! Oh, thank you !
- Hey, hey, hey !
- I say we go.
- Okay, honey. You're up.
- Oh. Um--
- Oh, oh, l-l--
- We're all very grateful to have...
- Here, here.
- [ Amplified ] the warriors--
Thanks.
[ Clears Throat ]
- I'd like to thank the warriors for helping us in our fight...
- [ Arguing ] against the grasshoppers.
Secondly, I would like to thank Flik...
- for his forthright thinking--
- Thank you, Your Highness.
Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for all of this, but that wouldn't be right.
Because it was you, Princess Atta.
You believed in me--
- Tell that ant that we need
to talk to him right now.
- Okay, okay.
I know I've made mistakes in the past, and I hope that this will make up--
- Flik !
- Not right now, Rosie.
I'm making a speech.
[ Grumbles, Whispers ]
Now, I truly believe these bugs are the answer to our--
No, there's no circus around here.
So, l-- [ Gasps ]
[ Whimpers ]
Your Highness, the warriors have called for a secret meeting to plan for a circus--
circumventing the oncoming hordes so they can trapeze-- trap them with ease !
- Shouldn't I come too ?
- No ! [ Laughs Nervously ]
No, classified in the D.M.Z.
Gotta go A.S.A.P. You know, strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye !
Sorry. Sorry I have to take
the warriors away so early, but you know they have a lot to get done, with the battle looming and all.
So, uh, please,
everyone enjoy the party.
" B.Y.O.B." ?
Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.
Okay,just-- just get in there. Go !
Go ! Go, go, go !
Circus bugs ?
How can you be circus bugs ?
- What ?
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You said nothin' about killin' grasshoppers. You lied to us !
-Ja !
Are you kidding ?
Do you know what this is ?
This, my friends, is false advertising.
How dare you ! You, sir, are the charlatan in this scenario-- touting your wares as a talent scout, preying upon the hungry souls of hapless artistes.
Good day to you, sir.
Wait ! No, no !
Wait, wait, wait, wait ! You can't go.
You have got to help me. Give me some time, I'll come up with a plan.
-Just go tell them the truth !
- They can't know the truth.
The truth, you see, is bad.
I will be branded for life.
My children's children will walk down the street, people will point and say, " Look ! There goes the spawn of Flik, the loser !"
Oh-- oh, you know, all right, fine.
Yeah, okay. Just go.
But if you could just do me a little favor before you leave.
If you could squish me, that would be great, because, uh, when they find out,
I'm as good as dead.
-[ Princess Atta ] Flik.!
- [ Gasps ]
I really do think I should be
part of this meeting. Flik.!
Aah ! Princess Atta !
What a nice... surprise.
Just what exactly is going on ?
I would like to speak with the so-called " warriors."
You can't ! They are in the middle of a top secret meeting right now, and they really should not be disturbed... now.
Right, guys ?
[ Gasps ] Could you ex-- pl--
Could you excuse me, please ?
- Wait, wait, wait.! Please, don't go.!
- I'm not going anywhere.
What is going on ? Flik ?
Flik ! [ Groans ]
Ooh, I knew it !
[ Flik In Distance ] Wait.! Wait,
wait, wait, wait.! Please.! Don't go.!
- No !
- Quick, he's losin' it !
- You can't go ! I'm desperate !
- Really ? I couldn't tell.
Hmm. Come on, wings.
[ Screams ]
Help !
Mother,
Flik is up to something.
Okay, Flik, time to put ya down.
Get him off me !
He's cutting off the circulation.
- No, no, no, no !
- Let go !
- Please, please, don't go !
- [ Rosie ] Put the stick down.
Flik, I mean it, now.
- Drop the stick.
- [ Screams ] Run !
Boy, he runs fast for a little guy.
- [ Squawks ]
- Tweet-tweet ! Tweet-tweet !
[ All Gasp, Scream ]

- Are they all right ?
- Did anyone see ?
- What is happening?
- Dot ?
- Good heavens, they're in trouble !

Here ! I've got it !
Please, ma'am, wake up !
Wake up !
[ Screaming ]
- Help ! Help !
- Yoo-hoo.!
Mr. Early Bird ! How about a nice, tasty worm on a stick ?
I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.
Nice andjuicy, succulent--
[ Flik ]
Let's go !
- There they are !
- Flik ! Help !
Okay.
- Flik !
- It's going to be okay, Dot.
Ooh-hoo-hoo !
Bye-bye, birdie !
Help ! I'm stuck !
Pull me down.!
Schnell, schnell, schnell !

himself as live bait.!

That, my friends, is the sound of applause !
[ Cheering ]
Applause-- I'm in heaven !
[ Sighs ]
Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs
for rescuing our smallest member,
Princess Dot.
And as a tribute to Miss Francis, we've changed out bandannas !
We voted you our honorary den mother !
- [ Ants Cheering ]
- What ? Great.
- [ Chattering ]
- All right, girls. Let's move your keisters outta here now.
The patient needs her rest, you know. Come on.
Excuse, me, Flik.
Can I talk to you for a second ?
- Huh ? Oh, sure.
- Oww !
Again, thank you all, very, very much.
- Oh, stop it.
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.
You don't think I've offended the warriors, do you ?
You ? No.
Oh, good. Because, you see, when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.
Ya did ?
[ Laughs Nervously ]
Don't tell 'em I said that.
Boy, that's all I'd need,
another royal blunder like that.
- Princess, you're doin' a great job.
- Thanks, you're sweet.
You're wrong, but sweet.
- I know what everyone really thinks.
- I don't follow you.
Everyone-- the whole colony. Nobody really believes I can do this job.
It's like they're all watching me,
-just,just--
- Waiting for you to screw up.
- Flik, I owe you an apology.
- For what ?
Well, I haven't been that nice to you, and... I'm sorry.
If there's any way I can make it up to you--
Hey ! I know !
How would you like to be the queen's official aide to the warrior bugs ?
- Me ?
- Oh, sure. You've got a great rapport with them, especially after that rescue-- it was very brave.
- Really ? Naw, naw--
- Well, not every bug would face a bird.
- I mean, even Hopper's afraid of'em.
- Yeah, well, I guess maybe l--
- Say that again ?
- I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.
Thank you.
- Hopper's afraid of birds !
- And I don't blame 'im !
Oh, oh, oh, this is perfect.
We can get rid of Hopper, and no one has to know that I messed up.
You just keep pretending you're warriors.
Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not about to fight grasshoppers, okay ?
You'll be gone before the grasshoppers ever arrive. Here's what we do.
Not another word.
I don't know what you're concocting in that little ant brain of yours, but we'll have no part of it.
Excuse me ? Could we get
the warriors'autographs ?
Autographs ? Ja !
- Wow! Great!
- So, you fellas catch the action today?
Oh ! The bird went-- [ Whooshes ] and it just missed you !
- Aren't you sweet ?
- And the way you pretended to be stuck in that crack !
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, that's just all part of the plan.
And then you dive-bombed into the bush !
- There you go, my boy.
- Wow ! Thanks !
" M-M-Maa-jor--"
That's Major Manny, young cadet.
-I outrank everyone here. Remember that.
-Yes, sir !
- Dismissed !
- Wow !
- When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a praying mantis !
- I'm gonna be a stick bug !
Oh, they're all so cool,
I can't pick.!
[ Chuckling ] Delightful lads.
You were saying, Flik ?
All right.
We are going to build a bird-- a bird that we can operate from the inside, which would then be--
...hoisted above the anthill and hidden high in the tree.
Then, right when Hopper and his gang are below, we'll launch the bird and scare off the grasshoppers.
Now it's going to take everyone's involvement--
...to make this plan a reality.
I know it's not our tradition to do things differently, but if our ancestors were able to build this anthill, we can certainly rally together to build this bird !
[ All Cheering ]
[ Laughing ]
- Perfect !
- Okay, hit your marks !
- Whoa !
- Whee-hee !
- [ Giggles ] Hi, Flik.
- Oh.

- I love what you did with your antenna.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, look.
She's a natural mother.
[ Growling ] All right, that's it !
Out ! Everybody out !

Now you're gonna cry, right ?
See if I care. Go ahead, cry.

- Please, don't cry. Please.

- Flik, watch out.!
- Whoa !
- Look ! I'm a beautiful butterfly !

There ya go. Goodjob, fellas.
Keep up the good work.
Huh ?
Okay !

You're fired ! [ Laughing ]

...all the way back there
and it starts to rain, we might
as well be suckin'bug spray.
Ooh, don't even say that !
You know somethin' ?
You're makin' a lot of sense.
I mean, why take the risk ?
- You should tell Hopper.
- Good idea.
But, you know, it's really not our place.
You're his brother.
That makes you, like... the vice president of the gang.
Wow ! It kinda does, doesn't it ?
Okay, I'll tell 'im.
I should talk to you guys more often.
- What if Hopper doesn't like it ?
- Then the genius'll get smacked and not us.
Vice President Molt.
[ Laughing ]
Ooh, yeah, that's good.
Oh, that's good.
- Ooh, a little lower. Ahh, lower.
- Hey ya, Hop.
- Go away.
- That's fine.
Then I won't tell ya my idea.
- Good !
- Okay, okay. I'll tell ya anyway.
I've been thinkin'-- which is somethin'
I do, bein' vice president and all.
This is a thought, and it was mine:
Why go back to Ant Island at all?
- You don't even like grain.
- What?
You're right. I didn't think it was such a good idea myself.
It wasn't even my idea.
It was Axle and Loco's !
They talked fancy to me.
I got confused !
- [ Grumbles ]
- * La cucaracha, la cucaracha *
* Da-da-da-da-da-da-da *
*** [ Music Stops ]
Guys, order another round... because we're stayin' here !
- [ Cheering ]
- Yeah !
What was I thinking ?
Going back to Ant Island.
I mean, we just got here, and we have more than enough food to get us through the winter.
Right ? Why go back ?
** [ Music Resumes ]
But there was that ant that stood up to me.
- Yeah, but we can forget about him !
- Yeah, it was just one ant.
- [ Mock Scared ] Ooo-oooh !
- One ant !
Yeah, you're right !
It's just one ant !
- Yeah, boss. They're puny !
- Hmm, puny.
Say, let's pretend this grain is a puny little ant.
- Didn't that hurt ?
- Nope.
- Well, how 'bout this one ?
- Are you kiddin' ?
- [ Laughing ]
- Well, how 'bout this ?
[ Screaming ]
You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life !
It's not about food.
It's about keeping those ants in line.
That's why we're going back !
Does anybody else wanna stay ?
He's quite the motivational speaker, isn't he ?
Let's ride !

Hey, how you guys doin' ?

Is that grain dip fresh or what ?
Okay, I've told everyone you'll be stationed deep in the command bunker.
Party quiets down,
I sneak you out the back way and then you're outta here forever.
Dim don't wanna go.
Well, if Dim stays he's gonna
need me here. He's not fully trained.

I, uh, I kinda promised the Blueberries
I'd teach 'em canasta.
It seems we've been booked for an extended engagement.

Will you just look at this colony?
I don't even recognize it.

And I have you bugs to thank for it.
So-- thank you !
And, uh, thank you for findin' 'em, Flik.

I am the great P.T. Flea !
[ Laughs ]
I'm in need of your assis--
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.
Look, I've been goin'
from anthill to anthill.
I'm lookin' for a bunch of circus performers. Have you seen 'em ?
- [ Crowd Groans ]
- [ Gasps ]
Wait a second.
Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim ?
No, no, no. I'm sorry, no, but uh--
[ Continues, Indistinct ]
- [ Rustling, Groaning ]
- [ Whispering ] Be quiet.!
Hey !
[ Flik ] You'll probably--
you'll probably want to get goin;
I guess you got a lot of other anthills to check into, so, bye !
- [ All Gasp ]
- Ah, guys, I've been lookin' all over for ya !
- Flaming Death is a huge hit !
- P.T. ! Sh--
- I'm serious. Word of mouth got around.
- P. T. .! No.!
The next day, there was a line of flies outside the tent went on forever !
- It must have been a foot long !
-[ Rosie ] P. T., no.!
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me twice a night, I take a day off to heal, and then we do it all over again !
We'll be the top circus act in the business ! [ Guffaws ]
You mean, you're not warriors ?
Are you kiddin' ? These guys are the lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen.
And they're gonna make me rich !
[ Chortling ]
You mean to tell me that our entire defensive strategy... was concocted by clowns ?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought
Flik's idea was gonna work.
[ Crowd Gasps, Groans ]
- Oops.
- Tell me this isn't true.
- No, you don't-- You don't--
- This couldn't have happened at a more inopportune time !
The last leaf is about to fall !
[ Dr. Flora ] We haven't collected
any food for the grasshoppers.!
If Hopper finds out
what we almost did--
Hopper is not going
to find out.
We're going to hide all this, and pretend it never happened.
You bugs were never here.
So I suggest you all leave.
But the bird !
The-The bird will work.
I never thought I'd see the day when an ant would put himself...
-before the rest ofhis colony.
- What ?
- The point is, Flik, you lied to us.
- No, no, no ! l-l--
You lied, Flik. You lied to her.
You lied to the colony !
You lied to me.!
And like an idiot,
I believed you.
But l-I was just afraid that... if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs--
[ Sighs Deeply ]
- I just wanted to make a difference.
- I want you to leave, Flik.
And this time, don't come back.
[ Crowd Gasps, Murmurs ]

Have you been playing all summer ?
You think this is a game ?
- No, no, please !
- Well, guess what ?
You just lost.
- [ Screeching ]
- Not one ant sleeps... until we get every scrap of food... on this island !
Just do what he says. You don't want to make him mad. Believe me !
No, no, no.
You're staying with me, Your Highness.
- [ Screaming ]
- What do you think you're doing ?
- Get over there.
- Quick ! To the clubhouse.

- Hey, I think I found something.
- [ Footsteps Approaching ]

Cool. Hey, how do I look ?
Like an idiot.
Oh, I don't know, maybe it'll keep me dry in the rain.
You moron, we'll be out of here before it rains.
Didn't you hear Hopper ?
After the ants pick all the food,
he's gonna squish the queen
to remind 'em who's boss.
Then she's dead. They cry--boo-hoo--
we go home. End of story.
Oh ! Cool. I love our job.
Stay here.

WOMAN: Hey, ass bag! Give me another!
Listen, you've run up quite a tab over the last few weeks.
-Why don't you say...
-Another shot, goddamnit!
Hmm. Oh!
"Come to the booth in the back.
Act casual, fat ass!"
Who the hell is that?
Please, don't cause any more trouble around here, Miss...
All right, lady. l don't know who you think you are, but l...
You've been busy.
Foxxy.
What the hell are you doing here?
We can't be seen together!
You'll get us killed!
Toot, you've got to come with me.
You're not safe here anymore, fatty.
What the hell do you care?
You're the reason we're in this mess, Foxxy. lf that's even your real name.
Of course it's my real name.
You don't know that!
You don't know anything. l know this. l deserved that.
You deserve to die.
Toot, l can't change the past, but l can change the future. l met somebody who could help us get our lives back!
Oh, yeah? Well, l've met someone, too. l've met a man who loves me for me, a man who's willing to cheat on his wife because he's a closeted homosexual who thinks l'm a man!
A man who refers to my vagina as a manhole.
Toot, Clara's dead!
Clara? She... She's...
Dead, yes. l sorry.
Oh, my God! l can't believe it!
She was so... So...
Now which one was Clara again?
She wasn't that little fugly battle monster thing, was she?
No, the princess.
How'd she die?
The same way we all gonna die! l.S.R.A.E.L. ! l.S.R.A.E.L.?
That's why you need to come with me before it's too...
Your location's been compromised!
Get out of there now!
-We gots to go!
-Forget it, Foxxy. l'm not... Aah!
Goddamnit! They followed you here!
Head towards the back of the bar!
Take a right! Go up the stairs!
What now, Wooldoor?
Oh, is that Wooldoor? Tell him l said hi!
Oh, hey, Toot how you doin'? Go straight!
Straight? But we on the roof!
Just do it!
Wait, what are you doing?
Stop! l can't fly without my feather!
The key's got to be here somewhere.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
We're gonna die!
Got 'em! Let's go!
Ah, we made it.
Hey, Toot, baby. Where you goin'...
Aah! Ooh!
Stop, stop! That's the man l love!
We can't! There's no time!
Barney!
Huzzah!
Hey, hey, hey.
Great googly moogly!
Whee!
Don't make me suck your dick!
Guys, you suck. l love racism!
A Jew in our backyard!
Ooh, l like that bitch!
Flavor flav!
Up the butt?
Goddamnit! l cut myself!
Surprise!
My special move is the reach around!
Ahh. Good morning, people and Foxxy. lt's a lovely day to be on a reality show.
And it's a great day to deny wetting the bed.
Which l did not do!
Ooh, it's also the perfect day to stay in bed and snuggle all day!
Hey, we should have another piñata party tonight!
But, uh, this time we should get a real piñata.
Guys, there really is nothing better than being on a reality television show!
Nothing!
-Attention, housemates.
-Ooh.
This is the Jew Producer speaking.
Please report to the living room for the next competition.
Competition? Ooh!
Wait up, guys, l'm almost ready.
Now l'm ready. Whee!
Good morning, housemates.
Today's competition is pretty self-explanatory. lt is?
Put on the heels, step on the puppies and kittens, and the person who crushes the most by the time l come wins the coveted, uh, l don't know, let's say, uh, immunity from next week's final judgment ceremony night?
Jew Producer, this competition is ridiculous. lt almost sounds made up.
That's why you're going to lose. Suck it!
And go! l thought l had a good chance to win. l made more bloody fur than menstruation time at Mount Holyoke.
And it's time!
Ooh! That felt good.
Ehh!
Oh, yeah. You guys did an excellent job.
Oh, oh!
Wait, Jew Producer.
You didn't even tell us who won.
Oh. Um, the winner is, uh, who hasn't won in a while?
Let's say that guy in shorts there.
Congrats. Here's your immunity, uh, scented candle.
Booya! You can all suck it, bitches.
That's right, number one, numero uno.
Something didn't sit well with the Foxxy. l mean, lately, all the competitions was about us doing some kind of bull crap so the Jew Producer could get his Jew-y rocks off. l can't be the only one who thinks these competitions is completely random and arbitrary.
Something ain't right here.
The Foxxy smells herself a mystery.
-What's so funny?
-Come on, Foxxy. lt's time to give up trying to redeem yourself.
Yeah. For weeks, you've been trying to make up for botching that mystery at the amusement park.
Mr. Wilkinson here denies being a super villain.
But let me ask you this, if you ain't not a super villain, then why would you need a bulletproof face?
Oh, Henry!
Hang in there, Henry.
Don't give up on me, you hear?
Don't you give up on me. lt's not your time yet.
You're a fighter, damn it!
Now fight, fight!
Damn! l was 40% sure he had one of them bulletproof faces.
Foxxy Love, you're the worst mystery-solving musician that's ever lived!
Yeah. The only case you ever cracked was the display case at Zales.
Oh, oh, l got one.
Foxxy, the only thing you're good at is giving head, and you managed to do the opposite!
Oh, yeah, good one, Wooldoor!
You, too, Wooldoor?
Oh...
Hey, champ. l'm sorry about what l said before. l was just trying to fit in.
Nah, Wooldoor, you was right about me. l ain't no good at mystery solving.
That's not true.
You're the bestest mystery-solving musician in the whole wide world! l don't...
Shut the hell up.
Foxxy, l brought you a special someone that l think will really cheer you up!
Papa?
You can come in now!
-Mrs. Wilkins?
Aah!
Get her off! Get her off!
Silly Foxxy. Mrs. Wilkins is post-menopausal. lt's impossible to get her off.
You'll pay for what you've done! Damn you!
What the hell is wrong with you, wooddork?
There is no good explanation for what l've done.
You are clearly out your fuckin' mind! l'm sorry. l really...
-Did you hear that?
-What?
You out your fuckin' mind! l said "Fuck," and they didn't beep it!
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
What about "Shit"?
What about "Cunt"?
What about "Shitcunt"?
No beeps!
They ain't beeping the curse words!
Go on, try it! Say something!
Ok. Uh, schwartza. Mud baby.
Smoked lrishmen. lnk face!
Nah, dummy, they never censor racism. l'm talking about words like shitcunt.
Ooh. l could never say that.
Those are bad words.
Ooh, if they ain't beeping, maybe they ain't blurring nothing.
Quick, fool, whip it out!
-What?
-Show me your cock. l thought you'd never ask.
Whee!
Oh, Wooldoor, you've been holding out on me!
Whoa! l've actually never seen my penis unblurred before. lt's way blacker than l thought it would be.
You know what this means? l was right!
There is a mystery to be solved.
And l's gonna solve it.
Thanks, Wooldoor.
So, little fella, let's go get you a burger.
Whee!
All right, ante up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.
Wait, Spanky!
We can't start guys' night without Hero.
Well, if l had some mystery hottie, l wouldn't be hanging around with you schmendricks, either.
Our special guy time is far more important to Hero than being with some cheap floozy who probably doesn't even secretly eat his toenail clippings, so at least a little part of
Hero can always be inside him.
Never fear! Captain Hero is here!
To play poker with the guys.
Oh! l knew you'd come!
Uh, Hero? ls that a dead girl?
Oh, hey, everybody, this is Molly.
She's my girlfriend.
Molly, is it ok if l call you my girlfriend? l know l probably should have asked you first.
How did we meet, you ask?
Well, it's a tale as old as time.
Molly was being held against her will by the evil legion of immediate family mourners of doom!
Back, you putrid, perverse purveyors of evil!
Captain Hero is here!
What? No, ma'am.
You don't need to repay me.
My reward is your safety.
A hand job, you say?
Well, l guess l do deserve one.
You're different from the others, aren't you?
Huzzah!
Ok, busted. We met on J-Date.
Hero, l can't believe you're doing this to me.
You're turning our guys' night into a guys' nightmare!
How dare you! How dare all of you! lf you can't deal with me being happy, then you're not really my friends!
Come on, Molly, let's get out of here!
And so the Foxxy set off to solve the mystery of why the fuck we wasn't censored no more.
And to prove to these assholes that l was a serious mystery solver.
And then, l made the most shocking discovery of all that explained everything.
Oh, Lordy!
Guys, l solved a mystery.
The only mystery you've ever solved is the mystery of the empty uterus. lf that's true, then how did l found out that the Drawn Together had been canceled?
C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c- c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c- c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c- c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-canceled?
-That's ridiculous!
-Girl, you crazy.
-Poppycock!
-Oh, really?
Then why can l say,
"You can all fuck my titties
"with your shit-covered cocks, you come-guzzling faggots!" without being beeped?
Yeah! How the fuck is...
Whoa! l just said, "fuck!"
Fuck! Oh, well, l'll be darned.
Dick-gobbling, blood-soaked, ass-eating turd taster!
Whoo-hoo! This is fun!
Guys, we are not canceled.
This is Foxxy we're dealing with, remember?
The worst mystery solver of all time.
Every time she tries to solve a mystery, someone ends up dead!
Fuck you, Clara.
Don't talk to me like that, Jemima-head. l am a princess.
Oh, yeah? Well, if you a princess, then why you got this chair in your face?
Ta-dow!
We can't be canceled. We just can't.
Can we?
Searching...
Tomorrow, l need you to run downtown and pick up a new pair of horn sharpeners.
Yes, dear.
Hey, after that, Jew Dad, can we play a little catch?
Of course, Jew Son. Gosh, l love you. l don't know what l'd do if anything would happen to you.
Oh, how emotionally invested l am in you staying safe and remaining alive.
As would anyone watching us right now.
-Oh, no.
-Don't you dare answer that.
-lt's shabbat.
-But it's work! lt must be important if the boss is calling today. l don't care if it's Moses himself.
Do not answer that.
Uh, l'll be right back.
Dude, l'm not turning your lights on for you again.
No, my cell phone.
Just hit the green button so l can answer it. l don't see why you don't just answer it yourself. lt's forbidden!
God's going to know you asked me to do it.
-No, he won't.
-Of course he will.
Well, then he'll appreciate my cleverness in getting around his laws.
Now hit send before it goes to voicemail!
Fine. l'll do it.
But first, you need to say you accept
Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
What? Are you insane?
Look, l'm not the one trying to fool the Almighty here.
Now say you accept Jesus Christ, and l'll answer your phone.
Oh, fine! l accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior. Happy now?
Yep. Now you can answer your own damn phone.
You're a fucking dick, Eddie!
Hey, boss.
You lied to me, Jew Producer.
What? Uh, no, l would never...
You told me after l canceled
Drawn Together, you erased them!
But l did! l swear!
Then how come the network just got a call from one Foxxy Love asking why no one told them they were canceled?
Busted.
By keeping them alive, you've put us all in great jeopardy.
-Let me explain...
-Too late for that! l am sending a friend of mine to pay them a little visit.
A friend?
Yes! The lntelligent Smart,
Robot Animation Eraser Lady!
Otherwise known as l.S.R.A.E.L. !
She will erase them all, forever!
Please, enjoy the rest of your Sabbath.
Oh, no. This is bad. l need you to start my car, Eddie.
The network keeps transferring me around.
Nobody want to tell me nothing. l can't believe we've been canceled. l thought our ratings were pretty good.
No! No! Without the distraction of the cameras, l'll have nothing to keep me from hearing the voices in my head!
Cut their throats and drink the children's blood, Wooldoor.
Their youth will be your youth.
Oh, Molly, hold me!
Cup the balls.
-l'd cup. lf only he'd ask.
Oh, who the hell took our goddamn timeslot?
The Suck My Taint Show?
Let me info this.
...and taint sucking, starring the loveable, poignant Suck My Taint Girl.
We got canceled for that?
Uh, attention, houseguests.
Tonight's competition is...
Get in my fucking trunk, or l will shoot you!
Yeah, we know we've been canceled.
Shut up, fatty. Now, everyone in my truck.
We're running out of time!
The Jew Producer's right! Toot is fat.
Yeah, he's got a point. l am fat.
Well, l ain't going nowhere until you tell us why in the hell we was canceled.
Come on, guys.
Have you ever even seen your show? lt's filthy, it's racist, and it has a shocking lack of Dave Chappelle.
Yeah, he's got a point. l am fat.
Now get in my truck! l'm trying to save you idiots!
Ah, save us from what?
From that! lntelligent Smart
Robot Animation Eraser Lady! l.S.R.A.E.L.? Why the fuck is it on our land when we already live here?
To destroy you all! Now hurry!
Prepare to be erased.
Run!
Holy shit! l.S.R.A.E.L. must kill you all!
Wait, wait, l'm sure we can work something out!
I.S.R.A.E.L. must be aggressive to survive! lt's a common sense policy.
Come on, y'all! To the mystery van!
Molly!
She's still in the living room!
There's nothing you can do for her!
She's dead! l've got to try!
Try
He really is delightfully retarded. l'm going to take that l.S.R.A.E.L. out!
Hold on!
Don't come any closer. l.S.R.A.E.L. has boundary issues.
Kung fu, motherfucker! l've got to try!
Try
Huzzah!
Try
Oh, no! The Drawn Together house, it's... lt's gone!
Oh, thank God you're ok!
Oh, flick my balls.
Faster, Foxxy!
The l.S.R.A.E.L.'s right behind us!
My kingdom is only a couple miles away.
We'll be safe there!
No, you can't go home.
None of you can go home, ever again!
You don't understand.
None of you are who you think you are!
What?
You trying to say l ain't really Foxxy Brown?
What l'm trying to say is you're all fakes!
Cheap knock-offs.
You're all parodies of the real thing created just to be on Drawn Together.
Now that the show's over, the boss wants you all destroyed.
-But why would he want...
-Look out!
Without you, my life really has no meaning.
Where is the Drawn Together gang?
I.S.R.A.E.L. must erase them!
They got away.
Looks like you screwed up, l.S.R.A.E.L.
You're in so much trouble.
You explain to boss what happened. l.S.R.A.E.L. is sick of being blamed for every little fucking thing that goes wrong in the desert.
Aah!
Oh, God. l was so scared. l mean, l wanted to go,
"Whee, wee wee wee," all the way home.
Never trust a Jew producer. l'm obviously a real Disney princess. lf l weren't, why would l be so much better than all of you people and Foxxy?
Maybe that Jew Producer was telling the truth! l mean, Clara, you may look like a Disney princess, but how many Disney princesses have done the things you've done done?
And how many times you seen
Josie and the Pussycats do what l doed?
Now, Foxxy, let's not jump to any conclusions here.
Come on, Captain Hero!
How many real superheroes do you know that bang corpses? l don't know.
Molly, how many superheroes have you been with? ln fact, ain't no real cartoon characters would do any of the things we done doed!
Come to think of it, l don't behave anything like the real Betty Boop.
Ah, please, Toot.
We're trying to have a discussion here!
Yeah, really, Toot.
Don't make this all about you.
This is horrible! We're canceled and fake.
Just like my child support checks.
-Ta!
Oh, yeah, laugh it up, Wooldoor, but l.S.R.A.E.L.'s after us!
No one can hide from l.S.R.A.E.L.
What are we going to do?
You heard the Jew Producer.
They want us dead because we's canceled.
So if we can get Drawn Together back on the air, we can save our asses!
Yeah, right, Foxxy.
How you plan on doing that? l don't know yet.
But we can start with that girl who stole our timeslot.
The Suck My Taint Girl.
She sound like she could help. l am fat.
Well, l'm not fake.
So l'm going back to my kingdom.
You're all welcome to join me.
My father, the king, will keep us safe from l.S.R.A.E.L. l do like being safe.
Molly and l always dreamed of going to Disneyworld.
You said you'd take me to Disneyworld!
Well, like a colostomy bag, l'm on Foxxy's side. l liked being a reality TV star.
Yeah! We need to get our show back.
Otherwise, l'll have to go back to my old gig, exposing myself to children, and that union has the worst health plan!
Fine! Then l guess we are splitting up.
How do we decide who gets the mystery van?
Later, ass bags! l'm sorry, sir. l couldn't let you erase the Drawn Togethergang.
They were my creations, and l... l... l loved them.
For Christ sake, Jew Producer!
They must be destroyed!
Tell me, boss, why do you dislike the Drawn Togethergang so?
Because, they took my family from me.
They did? l've never spoken of this before to anyone, but with l.S.R.A.E.L. by my side, l guess l feel safe.
My beautiful wife was taking our little girl
Sasha to her first day of elementary school.
They were singing something.
Something pure, something innocent.
Little Sasha was young and hadn't yet been burdened with the complexities and ugliness of life.
But then she saw it.
Mommy, Mommy!
What is that chocolate-face girl doing to the princess?
No, no, no, no.
Don't look at it, honey. Close your eyes.
For God sakes, close your eyes!
Mommy! The chocolate girl is eating the princess!
She's eating her face!
Why is she eating her face?
Mommy!
My wife lost control of the car and drove off a cIiff!
They landed in a deadly pit of alligators!
Swimming in a pit of sulfuric acid!
By the time l arrived, there was nothing l could do but get revenge!
Aah!
So, Jew Producer, it's not that l dislike the Drawn Togethergang. lt's that l hate those motherfuckers!
They took my family from me, and l'll be damned if l let them take my media empire!
Oh...kay. But still, l won't help you! l had a feeling you would say that. l.S.R.A.E.L. !
Jew Dad?
Jew Son?
Dad, l.S.R.A.E.L. forcibly removed me from the only home l've ever known!
You will help l.S.R.A.E.L., or you'll feel what it's like when something horrible happens to your child! You hear me?
Or should l speak up?
Ow! Ah!
Ok, ok! l'll find the Drawn Togethergang. l'll help destroy them! l.S.R.A.E.L., l think the Jew Producer will be more helpful now.
Off you go.
Destroy the Drawn Togethergang forever. l.S.R.A.E.L. has gone nuclear.
Oh, it's good to be home.
Hark! Who goes there?
Guards, tis l, your Princess Clara.
You may kiss my feet if you like.
Oh, and once l'm inside, you can execute them.
Wait, what?
Ha, ha! Just kidding.
Do you not know that impersonating a princess is a serious offense, punishable by death?
Do you not know that sucking my dick is a serious offense?
-Punishable by fuck you!
-Huh?
Now let us in at once, or l'll have your children killed.
Yeah, it's good to be home.
Princess! Your Highness.
What the... Who the fuck are you? l am the king!
The king? You are not the king.
My father is the king, which makes me the princess.
Father, l think this peasant has gone mad with the plague!
For everyone knows l am the true princess of the land.
My loyal, filthy subjects, surely you assholes recognize me. lmposter!
Guys? l think the Jew Producer was telling the truth. l think l'm a fake. l think we're all fakes!
Oh, my God. You know what l think?
Duh!
To the dungeon with them!
It ain't where it is and it ain't where it ain't lt's a little stinky thing l call a taint
Why don't you suck it, why don't you suck it?
Why don't you suck my little taint?
It ain't where it was and it taint where it ain't
And it's something they call my stinky taint
Why don't you suck it, why don't you suck it?
Why don't you suck it?
-What the hell is this?
-This is horrible!
She's a little girl who sings about her taint! lt's genius!
-Why don't you suck
-Why don't you suck
Why don't you suck her stinky little taint?
Why don't you suck
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
Suck my stinky little taint
-Suck my taint
-Taint
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
Come on and suck my stinky little taint lt's the most beautiful thing l've ever seen!
Don't you see? lt taint corporate greed, and it taint the politicians who have drained our economy. lt's the lack of personal responsibility.
-That is so true.
-l never thought of that before. l normally don't laugh at taint humor, but this is wrapped in such an important message.
Why don't you suck
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
Suck my taint
And when did it become a crime to be passionate about your work?
So what if l love the characters l created?
Screw him, right?
And kidnapping my son, whoo, how tacky.
Not to mention clichè!
You don't talk much, do you, l.S.R.A.E.L.?
I.S.R.A.E.L. taIks when l.S.R.A.E.L. has something to say. l'm just trying to pass the time, man.
Listen, l know you're a robot, but don't you have feelings? l mean, isn't it hard to destroy innocent people that have never wronged you?
Everyone's wronged l.S.R.A.E.L.
Really? Wow. lf that's the way you feel, maybe we'd all be better off if you didn't exist. l.S.R.A.E.L. has every right to exist!
Ok, ok, dude, relax.
Don't get so defensive.
I.S.R.A.E.L. need rest.
Here? This is where you want to rest?
This is the single most dangerous place you could be situated!
There are so many other places you could be, l.S.R.A.E.L., that would be safer and would cause less problems!
Why here?
I.S.R.A.E.L. shouIdn't have to Ieave.
Everyone else should leave.
They're the ones who are stupid.
Oy! l.S.R.A.E.L., you are a handful. l'm sorry, Drawn Togethergang.
But l have to save my Jew son.
Oh, l.S.R.A.E.L., l think l know where they are.
Oh, yeah. l haven't seen this many shit-covered rodents since my last colonoscopy.
-Ta!
Oh, it's ok, Clara.
So we're not who we think we are.
-So what, right?
-So what? lf l'm not a princess, then l'm just another beautiful virgin with real C-cups and a super tight ass that continuously vibrates and tastes like wild berries.
Who could ever love someone like that?
Dungeon master, make sure the guillotine is not too far back on the stage. l want the people in the front row to have to wear rain ponchos.
Milord, perhaps you could see it in your heart to let me live here in your kingdom and give me the opportunity to be the real princess l always thought l was.
For l can be just as good as the officially sanctioned princesses in your kingdom.
Allow me.
Yeah, Clara! She's doing it! lt's working!
For fuck's sake, Xandir! l'm trying to impress the goddamn king!
And l can't fucking sing if you keep flapping those dick-sucking lips of yours!
Guards, tomorrow, off with their heads!
No, wait! Please!
Release the king, vile peasant!
Hero! Do something!
Oh, yes, of course.
You shouldn't see this, baby. l know how you are around blood, and this could easily go that way.
Oh, you totally would not have been into that.
Excuse me, Suck My Taint Girl, we...
Oh, my goodness!
You guys are from Drawn Together!
Uh, l heard you were all erased.
-You know who we are?
-Well, of course l do, silly. l'm, like, the taintest fan of Drawn Together ever. l tain't missed an episode.
Well, good, 'cause we need your help,
Suck My Taint Girl.
We was canceled, and we need to get back on TV.
But of course you were canceled.
You guys were filthy and offensive without ever having a point.
A p-p-p-pa... Pa... Po...
Po... Po... Poi...
Poi... Aah... Poi... Ohh...
Ohh... Ahh... Oint?
Yeah! You know, like social commentary.
Everybody knows that these days, if you want to be raunchy and funny on TV, you need to also be relentlessly preachy.
-Too bad we never had a point.
-Hey. Know what you should do?
You should go to Make-A-Point Land and get yourself a point from the MakeA-Point wizard.
You'll be back on the air in no time!
Really? Because if you're lying, l'll cut you. l'll cut you to the fucking bone.
Ooh! Can you take us to this
Make-A-Point Land, Suck My Taint Girl?
Well, l really shouldn't be seen with you guys, but l could be convinced if you introduced me to the rest of the Drawn Togethergang.
Huh? What do you say? ls it a deal?
No, Molly, you're the cutest.
No, you are!
Watching Hero and his whorish know-it-all girlfriend made me sick. l had to get Hero to break up with Molly so l could have my best friend back.
And l had just the plan.
Got it?
Now, follow my lead, and don't fuck it up.
Uh, Xandir?
Wait, wait. Best friend in Ling...
Oh, God!
Asians are hilarious!
Come on, Ling-Ling.
Ling-Ling into depression go
He blew his chance with Xandir
Xandir only have eyes for Hero
Ling-Ling die alone
What was that, Molly?
You have the perfect escape plan?
We'll be out of here in no time?
Really, Molly? Oh, that's awesome!
When Molly just lies there and does nothing, we'll all be executed in the morning, and Hero will finally realize how lame his dead girlfriend is. l'm so clever!
Oh, l can't stand it!
Well, the guards are coming, Molly.
We can't wait to see your plan in action, can we, guys?
Molly... Come on, do something.
You're embarrassing me in front of all my guy friends.
Oh, maybe they were right about you.
Maybe we should just break...
-Whoa! That prisoner doesn't look so hot!
-She's pale, and that rat is eating her eyeball.
We better do something!
Ooh! Clever, clever.
Psst! That guard outfit makes you look fat. lt does?
Oh, great! Now l'll have to deal with that all night.
Ryan, wait up!
Molly, your plan worked like a charm!
Oh, l'm so happy!
Later on, l'm gonna let you fuck me in the mouth!
-God damn it!
-Now, let's get out of here.
Hey, the prisoners have escaped!
Come on, Clara!
No. l have nothing to live for anymore. l'm not a princess. Now, go. l'll slow them down for you. lt's the only way.
Thanks, Clara. You'll always be a princess to me. Here.
No, you keep them.
They're of no use to me now. l'll treasure them always.
Wait, Xandir, do me one favor.
Live your gay life to the fullest.
-Will do.
-Every day's a gift.
-Gotcha.
-And find that one special person.
Sure thing. Bye!
And hold him close and tell him with all your heart that you can't marry him.
The Bible forbids it. l really gotta go.
Ok. Bye! Don't adopt!
Give me those!
Molly hath saved the day!
Holy fuck, it's l.S.R.A.E.L. !
Uh, hey, guys, how are you?
Uh, l'd get the hell out of here if l were you.
-Huzzah!
So tired. So very, very tired.
Don't you give up, fool horse.
We got to make it to the kingdom to get the rest of our gang so we can all get to Make-A-Point Land.
And then, we still need to find Toot.
This is a joke. We'll never find everyone. l said, we'll never find everyone.
Look! There them are-uh!
And l.S.R.A.E.L. !
Whee...
Are all together again!
Wait. Where's Clara?
Oh, Clara? She's dead.
Oh, no.
-Yeah!
-Oh, good!
-Well, that takes the sting off.
-Her arms were always my favorite part of her.
Ashes to ashes, smurf to smurf. l'm glad you're dead, you bastard! l hope you smurf in hell for what you did to me in front of my kids! l hope you smurf in hell! lt's ok, sweetie.
Our long national nightmare is over.
He can't hurt us anymore.
The important thing is that you survived.
-We all survived.
Say good-bye, Drawn Together!
No!
-I can't see!
-I can't see!
Ugh! Holy crap! l can't open the door. lt's stuck! We gonna drown!
Don't worry, people. l'll get us out.
Yeah, there you are.
Uhh... That wasn't well thought-out.
No! l loved you!
The Drawn Together gang is gone forever.
Ok. We're on our way.
Molly, this may be it for us.
Commentary.
-Commentary?
-Commonary.
They usually have director's commissary on these things.
Let's listen to the commonary.
Maybe they'll tell us how to get out of here. lt's too late. We're all gonna die!
We have to try!
Menu.
Commentary.
Commentary on.
And play!
So, wow.
This movie just keeps on going.
-lt's, uh...
-l hear them!
-lt's a long thing... This movie...
-Help!
-How do we get out of here?
-Shut the fuck up and listen!
Actually might very well be a bad idea, but, um, Dave...
Dave, he needed the money.
Well, Matt...
Matt married into money.
Who the hell would ever want to listen to this? lt used to be money.
Now, nobody has money...
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Get to the point!
All right. So now we got, uh, we got the gang, we put them all in this pumpkin.
We put them underwater, and originally, this scene wasn't even in the script at all.
The only reason we did this is 'cause, well, we both thought that I.S.R.A.E.L...
We had to remind the audience that l.S.R.A.E.L. is still chasing after them.
Well, you thought they had to. l remember thinking we didn't really need this whole scene.
We were going with a new production company, and...
But l didn't want to fight with you. l remember being so exhausted, at this point.
My wife was, like, 9 months pregnant, and we were, like, in the middle of moving, right?
You're, like, the first person that ever had a kid.
That's how you act. l actually remember... l'm the first person that ever had a kid and had to argue with you at the same time.
You have got to be shitting me.
How the hell are we going to get them out of this scene?
We don't have any ideas, and l think... l'm pretty sure you're the one who's like,
"Hey, why don't they just suck on Xandir's dick,
"and Xandir's dick's got oxygen,"
'cause you're always like... The first idea is,
"Hey, they can suck each other's dicks!"
Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. l think your idea was,
"What if Xandir poos oxygen?"
Oh, no. "What if he farts oxygen, so they have to suck his ass?"
So yours was that much better.
-That's smarter.
-Oh, for the love of God.
This is horrible!
I don't even remember how we got out of this.
Oh, you know what it was?
This is how we come out with a Iot of these scenes. lt's, like, who haven't we used in a while?
Like, Ling-Ling? What if we pull his tail, and he infIates Iike a raft?
-That's fine, that's fine.
-So theyjust do that.
At a certain point, it's just like "whatever."
Ooh, l gots an idea, gang.
Let's use Ling-Ling as an inflatable raft.
So, anyway, l guess if this scene's going to be worth it at all, maybe we should at least see Foxxy's tits.
-I'm in.
-But first, let me take off my shirt.
We made it! Whee!
Nice tits, Foxxy.
Good work, gang.
Now let's go find Toot.
Now, the only one we needed was Toot, so we set off on ourjourney to find her, a journey of excitement and adventure, mystery and mayhem, love and loss, a journey that carried us to far-away lands and taught us so much about what was right here inside us all along.
A journey which would change us all forever.
And then, we found her fat ass.
Foxxy, what the hell are you doing here?
We can't be seen together.
You'll get us killed.
Toot, you got to come with me.
You not safe here anymore, fatty.
You don't know that.
You don't know anything. l know this.
Put on your 3-D glasses now!
3-D glasses not included.
FOXXY: Yeah, girl.
That's what the Foxxy want.
One finger?
Girl, you got to come back when you can at least kick in a big toe.
What are you guys doing? Making out?
Hey, lady, less talky, more threesome action.
Yes! God damn it, l miss Drawn Together.
Hold on. Oh, my God!
Where do you want it?
Where do you want it?
Anywhere but the face. l mean, that is really degrading to women. l mean, you could really...
-l deserved that.
-You deserve to die.
Get out ofthere now!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!
Stop! l can't fly without my feather!
Got it! Let's go!
Burn in hell, you fat fucking homewrecking bitch! lt's a living.
Outrageous!
How did you think you were going to get away with this?
A foul-mouthed clone of my daughter.
What if some child actually thought it was her using the word shitcunt? l understand. But we are taking measures.
We are taking measures, too. Ooh!
-What the...
Target has been eliminated.
Just to be on the safe side, erase the whole place.
And get back here when you're done.
There's been a change of plans.
But sir, this is the happiest place on earth. lt was the happiest place on earth.
Erase it aII. lt's a world of laughter
It's a worId of sunshine
After we got Toot back from Bedrock, we immediately brought her to Suck My Taint Girl.
You're all here! Hooray!
Wait. Where's Clara?
And we told Suck My Taint Girl the terribIe news about Clara.
-What?
-She took it pretty hard.
But after a long talk and a respectaful memoryial service,
Suck My Taint Girl agreed to take us to Make-A-Point Land, help us find the Make-A-Point wizard, get our point, and get our show back on the air, hence redeeming myself for getting us all into this mess in the first place.
Uh, why did you say all that?
Sorry, giving confessionals is a hard habit to break.
Well, it seems kind of crazy.
You know what's crazy?
You ass-bags dragging me here.
When my Barney comes for me, you'll all get yours.
This is great and all, but can we get going to Make-A-Point Land before l.S.R.A.E.L. finds us?
Tain't no time like the present.
But remember, there are lots of magical and mysterious creatures in Make-A-Point Land, and they don't take too kindly to those who are disgusting for the sake of being disgusting.
What? l'm sorry. l got distracted.
What were you saying? l was saying it's time we go.
Let's taint the town brown!
Uh, question. Why is your ship plugged into the ass of that animal?
Oh, Mr. Ham. l'm so glad you asked, because you're going to love this.
This ship is powered by... Wait for it...
Poo!
A feces-fueled rocket ship? That's awesome!
Yep. This ship is an ear of corn powered by bull shit because, don't you see, ethanol is bullshit.
Oh, yeah. l get it. l kind of liked it better when it was just a shit-powered rocket.
T-minus 5, 4,
Liftoff.
Well, l gotta hit the head.
Don't go changing while l'm away. l am sick of it just being the 2 of us.
Playing hot potato just sucks without my beloved Hero.
And l love hot potato!
Ling-Ling make sad realization
Xandir's heart is with another if Ling-Ling really loves Xandir like he says he does
He'll help Xandir get back Hero
What? Molly!
You promised me we'd go to prom together! l can't believe you would do this to me!
Later
Guys, it's over between me and Molly.
Oh, there you go. lt's ok.
Cry on my shoulder, darling.
-Hyah!
-Look, Make-A-Point Land!
Where? l can't see it. lt's right over there between
Why-You-So-Bitter-
About-Being-Canceled Land and You-Had-3-Or-4-Seasons,
You-Should-Be-Happy-With-What-You-Got,
Most-Shows-Don't-Even-Get-That Land.
Hold onto my taint, everyone! lt's going to be a rough landing.
Here we are, Make-A-Point Land!
Put on your 3-D glasses now!
3-D glasses not included.
3-D! The technology of the eighties, but it's now!
Whoa! Whoa! lt looks fake.
Let's move quickly, and don't taint any attention to yourselves.
-That's a fetus tornado.
-Huh? A fetus tornado?
Don't you see? People just go round and round when it comes to stem cell research.
Well. Not as funny.
Ray-Ray 2 through 7! Mama love you!
-Cool!
The Pfizersaurus Rex! Don't you see? lf we keep listening to the pharmaceutical companies, one day, we, too, will be extinct.
Not so cool anymore.
Come on, gang. Let's keep moving before we get spotted by floating Tom Brokaw made of semen.
Floating Tom Brokaw made of semen?
What the fuck is his point?
Maybe that the media is dumb and superficial and delicious?
Look! The wizard's palace!
Oh, no! lt's the Giant
Who Shits lnto His Own Mouth!
Fee, fi, fo, fums! l smell pointless abominations! l must kill you!
Wait, Giant Who Shits lnto His Own Mouth!
Now, l know my Drawn Togetherfriends are stupid, pointless, crude creatures of mediocre comedy.
That's why l brought them here.
To get a point. You can't kill them! l can do anything l want!
Except get the taste of shit out of my mouth.
Hold up, Giant Who
Shits lnto His Own Mouth.
You saying you don't like eating shit? l eat shit all day, every day, 24/7.
Of course l don't like it.
But it's how l was born.
Well, what if we help you?
Then would you let us go?
Mmm-hmm. lf only we had something we could tie to the giant's head to interrupt the flow of poop. lt's working! lt's working!
Amen.
Hallelujah. Your way talking. l... l can't taste shit, for the first time in my whole life!
Thank you! Oh, thank you! l'm finally free! l can eat whatever l want now!
Anything!
That's right, Giant. Anything!
Would you shit in my mouth?
Well, guys, here we are. lmpressive.
Thanks, Suck My Taint Girl.
The Make-A-Point wizard's got to help.
He's just gotta.
Uh, any chance there's a
Wrap-This-Thing-Up-Already wizard in there? l can't believe the MakeA-Point wizard finally gave me my point.
Of course! l represent the duality of goodness and martyrdom and the unencumbered id that is repressed when religion meets sexuality.
And crab.
-Come on.
Let's get ourselves back on the air.
Who has come forth seeking a point, hmm?
Your Majesty, l humbly present to you what's left of the Drawn Togethergang.
Oh, my. You kids have caused quite a bit of trouble.
Honestly, l don't even think a point can help.
You Honor, dis is our only shot. lf we don't get the Drawn Together back on TV, we ain't never gonna be safe.
Please, Mr. Wizard. Without my TV persona, l'm just another 33-year-old schizophrenic drug addict with jaundice and several deformities.
Fine, fine. Sheesh! l'll give you a point. lmpressive.
Well, this is it, y'all.
We's about to get our point, get back on the air, and things can finally get back to the way they was.
Don't you see?
Don't you see? Don't you see?
Wait! Maybe we shouldn't open it.
What the fuck are you talking about, Spanky?
Yeah! Just open it!
This doesn't seem right. l mean, maybe we don't want a point.
Don't you see? lf l can't fart or vomit or fill up an ice tray with the afterbirth of Foxxy's miscarriage and hand them out as ice pops to terminally ill children on my hospital tours without making some kind of point, then maybe it's just not worth it.
And l don't want to let dead chicks fuck me in my mouth for social commentary. l mean, what's wrong with just doing it 'cause it makes me feel good?
And l sure do like getting pregnant for no reason.
You know what? l agree with the pig.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Make-A-Point wizard, l guess we don't want to make-a-point after all.
Maybe that's the point.
Fuck you guys! l need Drawn Together!
Otherwise, l don't exist!
-No, wait! lt's...
-What the...
-Wooldoor!
-What the fuck, wizard? l'm sorry. l had no choice.
They said they'd kill me.
Who would kill you?
Hello there, Drawn Togethergang. lt's a pleasure to finally meet you face to face.
So you the dick that's been trying to kill us.
How the hell did you even know we was coming here?
-l told them.
Suck My Taint Girl?
Roved you?
Drawn Together is the lamest show ever!
Watching it was like watching taint dry.
And if l let you get a point, you might get your timeslot back.
Why the fuck would l do that?
Damn that girl.
Like my lawn after a visit from that klansman with short-term memory loss, we've been double crossed.
-Nice work, honey.
-Thanks, Scott.
-Mmm.
-That's right. Suck my taint.
Damn you, Suck My Taint Girl.
You betrayed us.
And then, you didn't even give us a fair fight.
Sometimes, l don't know if you're an asshole or a pussy, or something in between.
Now, l.S.R.A.E.L., on behalf of my dead wife and daughter from a previous marriage, erase them all!
Don't worry.
Barney will be here any second to save us. l just know it.
At least we're going to die together,
Drawn Together.
Please, l.S.R.A.E.L., l know they're obscene, pointless rip-offs, but l... l... Love them.
-Fag.
Ahem. Jew's a homo.
Move, Jew Producer, or l will destroy you as well.
You can't do this, l.S.R.A.E.L. Don't you see?
Even though everyone hates the Drawn
Togethergang, they have a right to exist.
Surely you understand that, don't you, l.S.R.A.E.L.? l.S.R.A.E.L. doesn't want to destroy. l.S.R.A.E.L. wants to peacefully coexist.
That's all l.S.R.A.E.L. ever wanted.
No wonder everyone hates you, l.S.R.A.E.L.
You're so goddamn aggravating. l said destroy them, you fucking idiot!
That's it! I.S.R.A.E.L. wiII not Iet you bully her around anymore. l.S.R.A.E.L. really is our greatest ally.
That's a bit much. l.S.R.A.E.L.'s going a bit overboard again.
Why in the hell are you laughing?
You're gonna die.
Because of this. l have enough e-5 to destroy all of MakeA-Point Land.
Looks like l'll be enjoying the Drawn Togethergang in hell!
You gots a real weird sense of humor.
Hero, do something! l miss Molly!
Looks like it's up to ol' fatass again.
That is totally not what l meant to do.
The Drawn Togethergang must die!
Oh, no, you don't!
Everyone, run, run!
Don't worry about the old...
Um, they left, like, 5 minutes ago.
-Guys! l haven't been laid in 6 months! l have an erection right now, and l don't know how long it will last! l'm just putting that out there.
Tain't yours! Taint give it to me!
Ok, but first, give it to me!
Don't you see? lf people all over the world would just...
Next year in Jerusalem!
Oh, Lordy!
Fuck yeah! l'm going to escape the fuck out of this shit!
Where the hell are you... Aah!
Oh, Barney! l knew you'd come for me! l just knew it!
Uh, yeah. Actually, l just came to tell you l worked out everything with my wife.
So we have to end our affair.
Sorry. Here. lt's a living.
Oh, damn it.
Oh, Lordy! Oh, now what we gonna do?
Oh, my God! Get us the fuck out of here!
Help!
Hey, you guys!
Take off your 3-D glasses now.
3-D glasses not included.
Yeah, but at least we're alive, thanks to you, Giant Who
No Longer Shits lnto His Own Mouth. lt's the least l could do. l wish there was some way l could help you get back on the air. l think l can help.
Jew Son! Oh, l'm so sorry about your father. lt's ok. He died saving those he loved.
Fag.
Ahem. Jew's a homo.
And now that he's gone, l'm taking over the family business.
Uh, l don't think so, but l do have a surprise for you.
Papa?
-Even better! l pulled some Jew strings and l think l can get you a Direct-to-DVD movie!
For real-real, not for play-play?
Yes, Foxxy, for real-real, not for play-play.
Well, no offense to you guys, but l don't want to be in a Direct-to-DVD movie if it doesn't have a happy ending.
-Hero, look who l found!
Molly!
Oh, l love it when she does that.
Hey, there, baby. How you doin'?
You like shitting in people's mouths, right?
What, Molly? Of course, l'd love to let you fuck me in my mouth, but not tonight,
'cause tonight is guys' night.
Aw, shitcunt.
Why don't you suck
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
-Suck my stinky little taint
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
Suck my taint
Come on, and suck my stinky little taint
Take it up the ass, metaphorically
Suck on a massive dong, allegorically
Slather spewing dung across a sweaty symbolic ass
And we can make this fuckall a better world
When you crap yourself, it's an opportunity
To scoop up the excrement and eat it
Thereby showing how you can jizz on a rotting cow
And make this fuckall a better world
Just make a point with your vomit
Make a point with unbridled mayhem
When you make a point to teach the boys and girls
That you can make a point by eating the puke chunks
And make a point by cannibalizing ears
Make a point and make this fuckall a better world
Gargle a glop of snot
Then swallow it, metaphorically
Fondle a donkey's cock while felching it, allegorically
Beat off into a Christmas stocking, mockingly
And make this fuckall a better world
Make a point and make this fuckall a better world
RA'S AL GHUL: I should never have allied myself with a madman. where are they? in Sarajevo, sir.
And he has the boy.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
MAN: wow, that looked like it really hurt:
[ROBIN GRUNTING] whoa, now, hang on.
That looked like it hurt a lot more:
So let's try and clear this up, okay, pumpkin? what hurts more? A? or B?
Forehand? or backhand?
[CACKLING]
A little louder, lamb chop. i think you may have a collapsed lung.
That always impedes the oratory.
[SPITS]
[GRUNTS]
Now, that was rude.
The first boy blunder had some manners.
I suppose I'm going to have to teach you a iesson...
...so you can better follow in his footsteps.
No, I'm just gonna keep beating you with this crowbar.
[JOKER CACKLING]
Where is the detective?
MAN:
He's on his way.
But, sir, he won't make it there in time. okay, kiddo, i gotta go. it's been fun though, right? well, maybe a smidge more fun for me than you.
I'm just guessing since you're being awful quiet.
Anyway, be a good boy.
Finish your homework and be in bed by 9.
And, hey...
...please tell the big man i said, "Hello."
[CACKLING]
[GROANING]
No.
Jason.
MAN 1 :
The hell you say.
You didn't set this up?
-Then whose party is this?
-i thought it was you east-side losers.
You already rolled over for the Black Mask and i figured you were gonna ask us in.
Rolled over? The Mask whacked six of my crew in a month. Six.
Some of my best people.
So you set up this meet?
No, i thought it was Chi Chi: wasn't my meet: oh, the hell with this. I'm gone.
You brain donors wanna hang around--
MAN 2:
Sit down, Freddie. it's my meeting.
CHI CHI: it's him.
-Batman? we didn't do nothing.
RED HOOD: well, we all know that's a lie.
-who the hell are you?
-Smoke him.
RED HOOD: i said, "Sit down."
You wanna die?
There's easier ways to kill yourself.
RED HOOD: Yeah, like yelling at the guy who's hoiding the AK-47.
Listen to me, you drug-peddling scumbags. i will be running the drug trade from now on.
You eight are the most prosperous street dealers in Gotham.
I'm offering you morons a deal.
You go about your business as usual, but kick up 40 percent to me.
A much sweeter deal than the scraps Black Mask is leaving you. in return, you will have total protection from both Black Mask and Batman.
But you stay away from kids and school yards.
No dealing to children, got it? if you do, you're dead. okay, crazy man, this is all very generous.
But why in the hell should we listen to you?
[CHI CHI VOMITS]
Damn.
RED HOOD: Those are the heads of all of your lieutenants.
That took me two hours.
You wanna see what i can get done in a whole evening?
Make no mistake.
I'm not asking you to kick in with me.
I'm telling you.
Forty percent works for me.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
-Go, go, go!
-where's Raymond and Denny?
-He got them. Just grabbed them up.
MAN: Screw it.
Just go, get us out of here. i think i iost him.
-You think i iost him?
-i think you iost him. i think we're good.
No, you're anything but good.
[GROANING]
[YELLS] who are you working for?
Nobody.
Look, we just boosted the truck and--
Lie to me again and crashing into a wall head-on...
...will be the least painful activity of your evening:
No, i swear to--
[BEEPING]
-what is that?
-Your cargo. it's called Amazo. what the hell is an Amazo?
A highly advanced, cybernetic android...
...equipped with the ability to absorb the power of super humans. what kind of super humans?
Big ones.
NIGHTWING: Packs quite the punch for a toaster on steroids, huh?
-Need a hand?
-No.
NIGHTWING: okay, well, how about i just stick around and watch? who's that other one?
The pretty boy in the leotard?
That's Nightwing.
He was the Bat's first sidekick.
The first Robin.
-i think you'll have to do better than that.
-i did.
[BEEPING]
NIGHTWING: will that do any good?
BATMAN: it'll slow it down.
You think so?
Get to higher ground.
NIGHTWING: Did you know he could fly?
-Move! i wouldn't be offended by a few suggestions.
He has the same weak points as a human being.
Got it. This might sting a bit.
[YELLING]
Lasers. He's got lasers. i don't think putty in his eyes is gonna hurt him.
But plastique will. Nice.
BATMAN: This shipment was meant for the Black Mask. i doubt you're behind this.
-who do you work for?
-i swear. we're not working for anybody.
This was our gig, all our idea.
-Let it go.
-Right.
[SCREAMS] i'll talk, i'll talk. Just stop. Just stop!
The Red Hood. we're working for the Red Hood. we don't have any choice. He's got--
[BULLETS wHizzING]
The shots came from the rooftop.
A sniper.
BATMAN:
A good one.
NIGHTWING: See him?
-Yeah.
NIGHTWING:
Hey, wait.
Right. Leave me with them.
[CAR HoRN HoNKING]
God, please, no. Stay away. it's a setup. wait.
I'm not a crook, i swear.
No!
RED HOOD:
Hard to forget that night, huh? in a way, Batman, this was the site of your first great failure.
Maybe your greatest, but certainiy not your last, right?
Ah, memories.
DICK: This bit of intel is what brought me to town.
Good thing i've always had perfect timing.
Take a look. i got this shot from a snitch. He says that this guy's been making some serious moves.
The Red Hood.
Might be.
He bears a resemblance to the original.
BRUCE:
Severai criminals have utilized this persona.
DICK: one criminal of particuiar interest, though.
-But he's locked up.
-Not his m.o. either.
There's been an uptick in heavy trafficking, but crime is down.
ALFRED: indeed it is.
Master Bruce got almost three hours sleep in the last two days.
True busman's holiday.
But he is locked up.
Like, a lot locked up.
Maybe we should go for a visit.
Could you just once say,
"Let's get in the car"? is that so hard?
[LAUGHTER ECHoING]
You look good. Been working out?
You could probably use a little sun.
Then again, who am i to talk?
[CACKLING]
BATMAN:
He's calling himself the Red Hood: what do you know about it?
That he has horrible taste. when i wore that number, it was classy.
More flashy maitre d' than motorcycle fetish. oh, these kids today. if you're behind this in any way, we will find out.
-You're not--
-oh, Bird Boy, you're so much less fun now.
All grown up and in your big-boy pants.
Still, better off than his replacement, right?
Even tougher making with the yuks when you're worm food, huh?
You gonna do it this time? or you just gonna put me in another body cast for six months?
So disappointing.
But back to the matter at hand...
...this new hoody.
You really think i would stir up so much troubie...
...and not make sure you knew it was me?
[CACKLING] i know you've never met him before, but be cool.
This here is the Black Mask.
The first boss to gain control of the entire city in 20 years. whatever he wants in Gotham, he gets.
But his appearance takes a bit to warm up to.
MAN:
He did what? what? oh, good, he's pissed.
WOMAN: our concern is the one who ordered the theft of the android.
He goes by the name of Red Hood.
MAN: i don't care what he's calling himself.
Do you idiots know how many bidders i had on Amazo?
A list of puppet dictators and psychos as long as my arm.
Millions shot right to hell.
-And whose money is that?
-Your money.
My money. Mine.
This score was a game changer.
Amazo was going buy my way up into high-end internationai trafficking.
Now I'm forced to keep rooting around in this local leg-breaking garbage.
And he gives me bat troubie, who blows the damn robot's head off! i could have at least sold it for scrap, but Batman kept it.
Yes, Batman likes to keep things.
-Look, this circus act, this Red Foot--
-Red Hood. whatever.
He's dead. Take care of him.
You, new guy.
-Sir:
BLACK MASK: Don't be nervous, kid.
But if you keep staring at me like that,
I'm gonna cut your eyes out.
[GRoANING]
-Give me the specs on tonight's shipment.
LEoN: Yes, sir. it's 10 cases of assorted SMGs and PDws...
...along with 5000 .45 caliber ACP rounds, your personal favorite...
...and two cases of RPGs. it's all bought and paid for, so this is strictly a delivery, not a buy. in view of recent events, i've taken the liberty of doubling security...
...and switching the drop spot.
RED HOOD:
That sounds like a plan.
Co-PiLoT: what are they waiting around for?
-Seriously.
Hey, protocol says I'm only supposed to be on the ground for six minutes.
RED HOOD: it's okay. i won't be staying that long.
And i almost thought he wouldn't show.
You know what i missed most about running with you? The toys.
Stay sharp. we're not done.
RED HOOD:
You wanna dance? Let's dance.
-is that gonna hoid?
-No.
So you want me to--? should i--? okay, i'll just take care of this.
RED HOOD: okay then. Nice night for a run.
-He's good.
-Yes, he's putting on quite a show.
He's very good. we got him.
-That's impressive.
-Nothing we haven't seen before. if you say so.
Think we iost him?
[BEEPING]
Move!
[BEEPiNG RAPiDLY]
[GRoANS]
RED HOOD:
You haven't lost your touch--
He's got some moves, huh?
And as much i hate to belabor a point...
And still that is often exactly what you do.
I'm chatty. it's part of my charm.
I'm saying that our boy here has some skills.
He's been trained and trained well.
Like right there. That.
He sliced that cable off his ankle before it went taut.
You don't just do that.
That has to be practiced. Learned.
-And then there's the knife.
-what about it?
You know many knives that can cut my lines?
-Not many.
-No. Not many. well, look, we obviousiy have got ourselves a player, we-- ow!
BRUCE:
Alfred, take him home.
Bruce, i can still help.
You already have.
Thank you.
Go rest up. okay.
But you know where to find me if you need me.
He did just thank me, right?
-indeed he did, sir.
DICK: weird.
RED HOOD:
You haven't lost your touch--
[TRAiN wHiSTLE BLowS oN ViDEo]
You haven't lost your touch--
--your touch, Bru--
You haven't lost your touch, Bruce.
[ROBIN LAUGHS]
ROBIN: whoo-hoo!
You guys having a party?
-i guess our invite got lost.
-it's over, Riddler.
Riddle me this. what's green and purple but covered in red and yellow?
You. when i land on your sorry butt.
MAN:
Don't move or i'll--
You'll what? Shoot me?
Twenty rounds a second and you were still too slow.
I'm not slow, punk.
-Me neither.
-i've got him.
[GRUNTING]
Robin! i had to take him down.
You shattered his collar bone.
He's a drug-deallng pimp. i didn't think i had to prop up some pillows before i took him out. we needed him. He would've talked.
But you put him into shock.
Sorry.
That was dumb.
But he deserved it.
BLACK MASK: Maybe my last request was too mired in subtlety. i want this man dead. when i say "dead," i mean seriously dead.
Beaten, broken.
His-head-mounted-on-my-wall kind of dead!
Understood. we'll be taking further precautions at every transaction--
Screw that.
Time he learns that this is a contact sport. we're going on offense.
Rough up his business.
Something big. Something loud. when he shows up to shut us down, have a party waiting for him.
And when i say "party"...
...i actually mean a whole lot of people who are gonna kill him!
-i figured.
-Just being clear.
[SiGHS]
[TiRES SCREECHING]
[ENGiNE REVS]
[PEoPLE SCREAMING] what are you doing? we're protected. we pay up to the Red Hood. is that right?
Cute.
Do you know who you're messing with?
Yeah, Tyler Bramford.
You're a club owner and some big damned drug dealer in the East Quarter, right? i am the East Quarter drug trade, you stupid bags of--
Manners, fatty. i don't care who takes care of you.
You watch your mouth.
Then you know who's got my back.
You know who i answer to.
Sure: The Red Hood.
And we work for the man who's gonna take back what's his.
CHiCo: So at the expense of your very wide butt...
...we're sending your boss a message.
[SCREAMING]
RED HOOD: okay. what's the message?
WOMAN:
A simple one, actually. want to guess what it might be?
RED HOOD: i have a few ideas.
Any of you hired guns even know who i am?
BAToN:
You are our target.
RED HOOD: ow.
So you four have all this power and all you do with it is kill for money?
BULK: From what i hear, we've got that in common.
RED HOOD:
You heard wrong.
BAToN: i thought you'd put up more of a fight.
RED HOOD: oh, the fight hasn't started yet.
I'm just stalling.
-what the hell took you so iong?
-Shut up and fight.
[GRUNTING]
[SCREAMING]
[PowERiNG UP]
[SCREAMING]
RED HOOD: i gotta say. i missed watching you work.
Look out!
RED HOOD:
Awful close.
You afraid you'll miss?
SHoT:
Black Mask just wants a body.
-we don't need your head.
BATMAN: Let him go.
And step away.
SHoT:
A Taser?
Nail me and you'll electrocute both of us.
RED HOOD:
Maybe that's what he has in mind.
No!
RED HOOD:
Just be happy i only killed one of them.
They're all assassins.
And what are you?
RED HOOD:
I'm cleaning up Gotham.
More than you ever did.
You're stealing territory from Black Mask and killing anyone who gets in your way.
RED HOOD:
Black Mask is just a part of the plan.
Pian? You're becoming a crime lord.
Yes. You can't stop crime.
That's what you never understood.
I'm controlling it.
You wanna rule them by fear. But what do you do with the ones who aren't afraid?
I'm doing what you won't,
I'm taking them out.
Tell me what happened to you.
Let me help.
RED HOOD: it's too late.
You had your chance.
And I'm just getting started.
BLACK MASK: Son of a-- Are you telling me that scumbag stole my guns again?
No, sir: He destroyed them.
Biew up the truck, the drivers....
Damn it. of all the-- Damn it!
Previousiy, he was just enlisting anyone under our province to come work for him.
Now he just seems to be killing them. oh, so now we've got another Batman? one who doesn't mind the blood?
No, sir, he's no Batman.
He's still taking huge cuts from off the streets.
But now he's eluminating the competition.
He's coming after you.
[CLEARS THRoAT]
[YELLS]
You wanna tell me why this guy ain't dead? we're trying. we sent the Fearsome Hand of Four.
Four? Guess they're gonna need a new name. why hasn't Batman wiped this little smear off the face of the planet?
Maybe he doesn't want to.
Perhaps he's letting you and the Red Hood war it out.
-He could be waiting--
-To take on the winner? what do you think this is?
A tennis tournament?
-I'm just saying...
BLACK MASK: You're an idiot.
And you don't know Batman.
He's not letting this lunatic just run wild.
He can't catch him either. or it's something else.
Can't you feel it? we're stuck in the damn crossfire. oh, hell.
Sir?
RED HOOD: wow, he sure can move when he really wants to.
-You okay, sir?
-I'm not dead.
So that's something. okay.
-Time to change up the ground war.
-How so, sir?
I'm being forced into negotiating with a psychotic.
That doesn't sound good.
No. it's going to be a nightmare.
Hey, fellas,
10 minutes to bed check, right?
-Terry? what the hell are you doing here?
-You miss me?
I'm covering Rothman's shift.
He's got the flu, bronchitis or something. we got this. why don't you grab some joe? we'll meet you in the south wing.
That's not protocol.
Come on, I'm bored, i need to stretch my iegs: Let's get--
[BULLET wHizzES]
Sorry, schedule to keep.
MAC:
You didn't have to kill him. one, yes, i did.
Two, we're paying you a ton.
So, three, shut your gob and open the damn door.
-Does he know what's going on?
-He knows he's leaving.
JOKER: it's gonna be a sleepover, right? i packed my toothbrush.
-Do you need more light, sir?
-No: i can see fine. well, there you have it.
He's still at rest.
No, he isn't.
That's not flesh.
-Master Bruce, you can't blame yourself--
BRUCE: it was stupid and careless.
Body was made of high-end latex. if i'd bothered to look inside when i brought him home....
Sir, please, remember how distraught you were. Even i found it hard--
Stupid and careless.
-where are you going?
-To talk to the man who did this. i hope you understand the trouble i've gone through...
...to arrange this little get-together here.
A lot of money. A lot of dead meat.
Look, i've got a problem.
And you are absolutely the man who possesses the gifts...
...to take care of this problem. i need you to murder the Red Hood.
You think you can handle that?
[CoUGHS]
May i have some water?
[JoKER CACKLING]
I'm going to need something to wear...
...and a very big truck.
Sure: Anything else? i'll need some guys.
Not these guys because, well, they're kind of dead. what did you do to Jason?
Act like you don't know what I'm talking about and i'll dislocate the shoulder.
That's just to start. if you haven't disabled the roof sensors, my guards will be here in under a minute.
Answer me.
I'm willing to...
...but it'll be more expedient if you hand me the communicator in my pocket...
...and i call off my men.
Commander, this is Ra's Al Ghul.
Stand down. i will be entertaining a guest in my study.
You remember when we last became embattled?
You were planning to blow up banks.
Accurate, if inelegant. i was in the midst of toppling the economy of Europe...
...but you were on to me. i sought a distraction.
So i hired the Joker.
When your paths crossed in Bosnia...
...it was to appear that you had stumbled upon him.
He was paid extremely well for what was intended to be a wild-goose chase.
Then he murdered the boy.
That was not by design.
I'm afraid i overestimated my ability to control the Joker...
...just as i underestimated his madness. it grieved me, sir...
...to be a party to something so brutal.
You've never shied away from drawing blood.
True, but always with purpose.
Always with greater goals.
This was simply an unnecessary casualty.
As penance, i chose not to make war with you again...
...and to attempt to rectify this disservice.
Rectify?
Yes: i had hoped to return to you what you had lost. l have walked this world for nearly six centuries.
As you know...
...i achieve this by bathing in the rejuvenating waters of the Lazarus Pit.
Along with its healing abilities...
...it has long been rumored that it is capable of an even greater feat...
...to raise the dead.
Procuring the remains of your partner was not difficult.
You had come to Bosnia under the guise of Bruce Wayne...
...and you chose to depart as such.
You even concocted the cover story...
...that young Jason had died in a bombing in Sarajevo.
This made it easy for me.
All it took was a few payoffs to replace his body. i felt confident that you would not perform an autopsy...
...even if you had, we still would have bought enough time.
But my plan...
...well, detective, it had unfortunate results.
[SCREAMING]
He returned to this world...
...but returned damaged.
My army searched for months...
...but we were never able to find a body or pick up a trail. i thought him dead yet again.
But i hear you have been having trouble at home. i have returned your son to you as a blight upon your house.
He burns the very kingdom you--
--protect.
Shall i alert the guards to pursue him?
Don't be foolish.
They would never catch him.
Besides, i have done enough.
ALFRED:
Sir, please take this to heart. who Jason was before, how we lost him...
...and this dark miracle or curse that has brought about his return...
...it is not your fault. l know you view his death as your greatest failure but--
His life and his death are my greatest failure.
Do you remember how he was when i found him? of course, sir.
Fearless, arrogant, brash and gifted.
BATMAN: Yes.
Different than Dick in so many ways...
...but still so full of potential and power.
But i knew, even from the beginning, he was dangerous. lf i hadn't made him into Robin, he would have grown to do wrong.
Then i got him killed.
My partner.
My soldier.
My fault. i own that. i'll carry that like everything else:
But now there's this.
He's taken everything i've ever taught him and turned it on me. it's a hell of my own making, Alfred.
Sir, this is not your doing.
You loved him: He knows that.
-it should be enough.
-it's not.
[CoMPUTER BEEPING] woMAN oN TV:
Reporting live from Gotham Bay Bridge....
My word.
Sir, patch into the media feed now.
[SiRENS wAiLING]
[JoKER CACKLING]
MAN:
Come on, get out of there, now.
Don't know what that maniac's up to, but nobody make a move till i give the order.
JoKER [SiNGING]: i'm a little teapot
Short and stout
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
This wasn't part of the damn deal, you freak!
Get me out of here right now! i thought you'd enjoy seeing some old faces.
After all, most of these guys used to work for you.
MAN: who's that? Get a light on him.
Up there.
Hey, look at you. Mr. Hood. or do you prefer Red? i used to wear an outfit a lot like that.
Mine was more flashy maitre d' than motorcycle fetish.
You kids today.
I'm sorry, could you hoid on? i was just in the middle of setting fire to your gang.
RED HOOD: Go ahead.
You think i care if that scum dies?
Don't know. i just wanted your attention.
RED HOOD:
You've always had my attention.
But what i really wanted was an audience with you.
I'm sorry, that seems to imply that you organized this little clambake.
RED HOOD: i did. Sure, i had lots of plans...
...but the endgame was getting Black Mask so desperate that he'd cut a deal.
He was the only one with the connections to get into Arkham...
...and get you out.
You can't trust anybody.
So i've been bamboozled. oh, my.
RED HOOD: i wouldn't undersell it. it took a lot of work to bring about our reunion.
Reunion? Have we met before?
RED HOOD:
Yes, we have. well, here's to warm memories.
[MUFFLED SCREAMING]
[YELLS]
[SCREAMING]
RED HooD [oVER RADio]: i've got him.
You want him? Meet me at crime alley.
[CoUGHING]
[LAUGHING] okay.
So, what's the plan?
Slumber party? Charades?
A little Truth or Dare?
Yes: i'll start with "dare." well, maybe i'll just go with "truth."
[JoKER GRUNTING]
RED HOOD:
Tell me, how does that feel?
You know, it only hurts when i laugh.
But, hey, i gotta know. who are you?
You said we knew one another, and you do seem really familiar. we double at the prom? or maybe blow up a school bus together?
RED HOOD:
No: I'm just something you helped make.
That's pretty cryptic...
...but interesting.
Tell me more.
RED HOOD:
Sure. Listen up.
[JoKER GRUNTING]
BATMAN:
Unreal.
RED HOOD:
Hello.
So glad you could make it.
This ends tonight. All of it.
RED HOOD:
Nobody knows that better than me.
RED HOOD:
Ha. oh, you and your gadgets.
You're not the oniy one with toys.
[BEEPING]
Crap.
[GRUNTING]
[RED HooD LAUGHING]
Look at you. i guess we should keep it even.
Jason.
Yes.
BATMAN: i don't wanna fight you.
RED HOOD:
All evidence to the contrary.
Please, i can help you. i know what happened. oh, you got to talking with Ra's, huh?
Does it make it easier for you to think that my dip in his fountain of youth...
...turned me rabid? or is this just the real me?
Tell me...
...what bothers you more, that your greatest failure has returned from the grave? or that i've become a better Batman than you?
You're ruling through intimidation and murder. Just another criminal.
I'm what this city needs.
Hidden goodies all over, huh? we're both just a couple of walking armories.
Maybe so, but let's see how you do without your toys.
Enough. it's over.
You say you wanna be better than me.
But it won't happen.
Not like this. i know i failed you...
...but i tried to save you, Jason.
I'm trying to save you now. is that what you think this is about?
That you let me die? i don't know what clouds your judgment worse.
Your guilt or your antiquated sense of morality.
Bruce, i forgive you for not saving me.
But why? why on God's earth...
...is he sti;; alive?
[CACKLING]
Gotta give the boy points.
He came all the way back from the dead to make this shindig happen.
So who's got a camera? ooh! ooh!
Get one of me and the kid first.
Then you and me, then the three of us.
And then one with the crowbar. Then--
[YELLS]
You'll be as quiet as possib;e or i'll put one in your ;ap first.
Party pooper. No cake for you. ignoring what he's done in the past.
Blind;y, stupid;y, disregarding the entire graveyards he's filled...
...the thousands who have suffered, the friends he's crippled.
You know, i thought-- i thought i'd be the last person you'd ever let him hurt. if it had been you that he beat to a bloody pulp...
...if he had taken you from this worid, i would've done nothing...
...but search the planet for this pathetic pile of evil death-worshipping garbage...
...and sent him off to hell.
You don't understand. i don't think you've ever understood. what? what, your moral code just won't allow for that? it's too hard to cross that line?
No. God Aimighty, no. it'd be too damned easy.
All i've ever wanted to do is kill him.
A day doesn't go by i don't think about subjecting him...
...to every horrendous torture he's dealt out to others and then end him.
Aw. So you do think about me.
But if i do that...
...if i allow myself to go down into that piace...
...i'll never come back. why? I'm not talking about killing Penguin or Scarecrow or Dent.
I'm talking about him. Just him.
And doing it because....
Because he took me away from you. i can't. I'm sorry.
That is so sweet. well, you won't have a choice.
-i won't--
-This is what it's all been about.
This.
You, and me and him.
Now is the time you decide. if you won't kill this psychotic piece of filth, i will. if you wanna stop me, you're gonna have to kill me.
-You know i won't--
-I'm gonna biow his deranged brains out.
And if you wanna stop it, you are gonna have to shoot me.
Right in my face.
This is turning out even better than i'd hoped. it's him or me, you have to decide.
Decide now. Do it.
Him or me? Decide.
[JoKER CACKLING] i can't believe you got him.
You expert, rooting-tooting, eagle-eyed, goth-loving marksman. i iove it.
You managed to find a way to win.
And everybody still loses.
No, don't spoil it. This is better.
I'm the only one who's gonna get what he wants tonight.
Yes, bing, bang, boom. we all go out together.
Don't you just love a happy ending?
[CACKLING] woMAN oN TV: Sources close to the district attorney's office have intimated...
...the case will likely be dropped due to lack of evidence.
But the Black Mask is still under investigation for his alleged complicity...
...in Joker's escape from Arkham.
The guards charged with aiding and abetting the escape...
...were found murdered in the Gotham courthouse jail...
...while the alleged crime lord, Black Mask, was released...
...on $1 million bail for his suspected involvement...
...and is currently awaiting a hearing.
Meanwhile, the Joker has been returned to Arkham Asylum.
Officials claim extra measures have been taken...
...to ensure another escape would be impossible.
MAN: Prior to his arrest,
Black Mask was being strong-armed...
...by the mysterious Red Hood.
ALFRED:
Sir: in light of all the recent events, would you like me to remove that?
No.
This doesn't change anything. it doesn't change anything at all.
BATMAN: okay, let's go. if you can't suit up quickly at home base...
...I'm concerned how you would handle it in the field.
ALFRED:
Perhaps he's primping.
As i recall, Master Richard spent nearly half an hour admiring his reflection...
...the first time he donned his cape.
Jason, get on out here or I'm going on patrol without you.
-Ha!
-My word.
-Gotcha.
-would have...
...if i hadn't seen you slip behind the computer banks three minutes ago.
-No, i got you.
-How does it feel?
[GRUNTING] it feels awesome.
Check me out.
I'm Robin, the Boy wonder.
Are you kidding me? This rocks.
Come on, old man, we've got bad guys who need chasing.
This is the best day of my life.

Oh, ho!
Marie, my little one.
You're going to be as beautiful as your mother.
Isn't she, Duchess?
Careful, Toulouse.
You're making it very difficult for Edgar.
Whoa, Frou-Frou, whoa.
Steady, girl.
Thank you, Edgar.
Oh. Of course, Frou-Frou.
I almost forgot.
Madame... uh, may I take your parcel, Madame?
It really is much too heavy for you, Madame.
Now, tut-tut, Edgar.
Don't fuss over me.
Berlioz, come back here.
Haven't you forgotten something, darling?
Thank you, Miss Frou-Frou, for letting me ride on your back.
You're quite welcome, young man.
How was that, Mama?
Very good, darling.
That was very nice.
Come along, Duchess. Kittens.
Come along.
Oh, and Edgar,
I'm expecting my attorney,
Georges Hautecourt.
You'll remember him, of course.
Of course, Madame.
How could anyone forget him?

Come on, Edgar! The last one up the stairs is a nincompoop!
Could we take the elevator this time, sir?
Oh, that birdcage? Poppycock.
Elevators are for old people. Whoops!
May I give you a hand, sir?
You haven't got an extra foot, have you, Edgar?
That always makes me laugh, sir.
Every time.
- Whoo!
- Let go of my cane!
Careful, sir. Please.
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Don't panic, Edgar.
Upward and onward! Whee!
Am I going too fast for you, Edgar?
Please, sir, hold...
There now, Duchess. That's better.
We must both look our best for Georges.
He's our oldest and dearest friend, you know.
Come in.
Announcing...
Monsieur...
Georges...
Hautecourt.
Oh, my goodness, Edgar.
I know Georges.
Adelaide, my dear.
So good to see you, Georges.
Aaah!
Still the softest hands in all Paris.
You're a shameless flatterer, Georges.
Adelaide, that's music.
It's from Carmen, isn't it?
That's right. It was my favourite role.
Yes, yes.
It was the night of your grand premiere that we first met. Remember?
- Oh, indeed, I do.
- And how we celebrated your success.
Champagne, dancing the night away...
Oh, Georges.
Oh, ho!
Thank goodness.
Just in time.
Ah, Georges.
We're just a pair of sentimental old fools.
Now, Georges, do be serious.
I've asked you to come here on a very important legal matter.
Oh? Oh!
Splendid, splendid.
Who do you want me to sue, eh?
Come now, Georges. I don't wish you to sue anyone.
I simply want to make my will.
Will, eh? Will, will...
Now, then, who are the beneficiaries?
Well, as you know, I have no living relatives.
Naturally, I want my beloved cats to be always well-cared for.
Certainly, no one can do this better than my faithful servant, Edgar.
Edgar?
Adelaide, you mean to say you're leaving your vast fortune to Edgar?
Everything you possess?
Stocks and bonds?
This mansion? Your country chateau?
Your treasures, jewels, and...?
Oh, no, no, Georges.
- To my cats.
- To your cats?
Cats?
Yes, Georges.
I simply wish to have the cats inherit first.
Then, at the end of their lifespan, my entire estate will revert to Edgar.
Cats inherit first?
And I come after the cats.
I, me, after...
It's... it's not fair.
Whoo! I mean, whoo.
Each cat will live about 12 years.
I can't wait... And each cat has nine lives.
That's four times 12...
Multiply by nine times...
No, it's less than that. Anyway, it's much longer than I'd ever live.
I'll be gone.
No.
Oh, no. They'll be gone.
I'll think of a way.
Oh... there are a million reasons why I should.
All of 'em dollars.
Millions.
Those cats have got to go.
Wait for me, wait for me!
Me first, me first. Whoo.
Why should you be first?
Because I'm a lady, that's why.
Ha-ha. You're not a lady.
You're nothin' but a sister.
Oh!
I'll show you if I'm a lady or not.
- You're tickling.
- Get her, Berlioz, get her.
Fight fair, Marie.
Females never fight fair.
Ow! Now, that hurt.
Mama! Mama!
Marie, darling, Marie, you must stop that.
This, this is really not ladylike.
And Berlioz?
Such behaviour is most unbecoming to a lovely gentleman.
Well, she started it.
Ladies do not start fights, but they can finish them.
Berlioz.
Now, don't be rude.
We were just practising biting and clawing.
Aristocrats do not practise biting and clawing and things like that.
That's just horrible.
But someday we might meet a tough alley cat.
That will do.
It's time we concerned ourself with self-improvement.
You want to grow up to be lovely charming ladies and gentlemens.
Now, Toulouse, you go and start on with your painting.
Yes, Mama.
Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint before we start our music lesson?
Please?
Well, yes, my love, but...
- Whoops.
- ...you must be very quiet.
Uh-Oh.
Mm-hm. Mm-mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
It's Edgar.
Yeah, old pickle-puss Edgar.
"Old pickle-puss"? Now, now.
Berlioz, that is not kind.
You know Edgar is so fond of all of us and takes very good care of us.

Oops. Oh, dear.
Slip of the hand and it's off to dreamland.
I say, that's not at all bad.
Slip of the hand... dreamland.
Let's leave Toulouse to his painting.
Now, dear, you go to the piano. Now, run along.
Both of you, go ahead.
Yes, Mama.
It's time to practise your scales and your arpeggios.
Ouch!
I'm ready, maestro.
Ooh!
Mama, he did it again.
- Tattletale.
- Now, Berlioz.
Now, please, darling, settle down and play me your pretty little song.

Oh. Good evening, my little ones.
Your favourite dish, prepared a very special way.
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.
Sleep well... I mean, eat well, of course.
Good evening, Duchess.
- Hello, kittens.
- Hello, Roquefort.
- Hi, Roquefort.
- Good evening, Monsieur Roquefort.
Mm. Something smells awfully good.
What is that appetising smell?
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.
Won't you join us,
Monsieur Roquefort?
Well, yes. I mean...
I don't mean to interrupt.
But...
But it so happens that I have a cracker with me.
Come on, Roquefort, have some.
Oh, thank you. Don't mind if I do.
Just a few dunks.
Mm. Oooh. Very good.
My compliments to the chef.
Mm. This is yummy.
Mm.
Delicious.
Double delicious.
This calls for another cracker.
I'll be right back.
So that's... crème de la crème... a la...
Edgar.
Ahhh!
Lafayette. Hey, Lafayette.
Lafayette!
- Well, I'm right here.
- Listen.
Wheels approaching.
Oh, Napoleon, we done bit six tyres today.
Chased four motorcars and a bicycle and a scooter.
Hush your mouth.
It's a motorcycle.
Two-cylinder, chain drive, one squeaky wheel on the front, it sounds like.
You go for the tyres, and I'll go right for the seat of the problem.
How come you always grab the tender part for yourself?
'Cause I outrank you, that's why.
Now, stop beating your gums and sound the attack.
No, that's mess call.
Yeah, made a mess of it, huh?
You can be replaced, you know.
OK, let's charge. Oooh.
Wait a minute. I'm the leader.
I'm the one that says when we go.
Here we go.
Charge!
Whew.
Ahh! Oww!
Nice doggy, nice doggy.
Heel, roll over, play dead!
Yow!
This sure beats running, Napoleon.
Step on the gas, Napoleon.
I got 'er wide open.
Oww!
Oh!
Oh, where am I?
I'm not at home at all.
Children, where are you? Answer me.
Berlioz?
Toulouse, Marie, where are you?
Here I am, Mama.
Marie, darling. Well, are you all right?
Uh, I guess I had a nightmare and fell out of bed.
Now, Marie, darling, don't be frightened.
Mama! Mama!
That's Berlioz.
Over here, darling.
Berlioz, here we are.
And don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.
I'm coming, Mama.
Gee, I'm cold and I'm wet.
Mama?
Mama!
Darling.
That's only a little frog, my love.
He had a mouth like a hippo-lotamus.
Oh, what's so funny?
Not now, darling. Darlings, you just stay here.
I go and I look for Toulouse.
Toulouse?
Toulouse, where are you?
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!
Toulouse!
Hey! What's all the yelling about, huh?
Why didn't you answer?
Mama, he's been here all the time.
Oh, thank goodness.
Are you all right?
I was having a funny dream.
Edgar was in it.
And we were all riding and bouncing along...
Frogs? Uh-oh. It wasn't a dream.
- Edgar did this to us.
- Edgar?
Oh, darling, why, that's...
Why, that's ridiculous.
Yeah, maybe you fell on your head, Toulouse.
Mama, I'm afraid. I wanna go home.
Now, my darling, don't be frightened. You'll see...
Oh, dear. Let's get into the basket, all of us.
What's gonna happen to us?
Well, darlings, I just don't know.
It does look hopeless, doesn't it?
I wish we were home with Madame right now.
Oh, poor Madame.
She will be so worried when she finds us gone.
Duchess? Kittens?
Oh, my gracious.
I had the most horrible dream about them.
Thank goodness it was only a dream.
Oh, dear, what a terrible night.
Now, now, my darlings.
Don't be frightened.
The storm will soon pass.
Oh, no! They're gone.
Duchess! Kittens!
Duchess! Where are you?
They're gone. They're gone!
Duchess? Kittens? Gone?
Why, that's terrible.
But where? Why?
Good heavens. Anything could happen to them on a night like this.
Get washed down a storm drain, struck by lightning...
Oh, they'll need help.
I've just got to find them.
Duchess! Kittens?
Duchess!
Kittens!
Kittens!

Duchess.
Beautiful. Love it.
And those eyes.
Oooh.
Why, your eyes are like sapphires sparkling so bright.
They make the morning radiant and light.
- How romantic.
- Sissy stuff.
Very poetic.
But it is not quite Shakespeare.
Of course not. That's pure O'Malley, baby.
Right off the cuff.
I got a million of them.
Oh, no more, please.
I am really in a great deal of trouble.
Trouble?
Helping beautiful dames... uh, uh, damsels in distress is my specialty.
Now, what's the hang-up, your ladyship?
Well, it is most important that I get back to Paris.
So if you would be just so kind and show me the way...
Show you the way?
Perish the thought.
We shall fly to Paris on a magic carpet, side by side, with the stars as our guide.
Just we two.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Three?
Four?
Five?
Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley.
- These are my children.
- Oh, how sweet.
Do you really have a magic carpet?
- Are we really gonna ride on it?
- Now, now, Marie.
Mama, do I have sparkling sapphire eyes
- that dazzle, too?
- Did I say that?
Yes, right off your cuff.
And you said we're gonna ride on your magic carpet.
Well, now, uh...
What I meant... You see, I...
No poetry to cover the situation, Monsieur O'Malley?
What I had in mind was kind of a sports model, baby.
- You know, one of those...
- Perhaps a magic carpet?
Built for two?
I wouldn't take up much room.
I understand perfectly,
Monsieur O'Malley.
Well, come along, darlings.
I'm a tough alley cat, too.
Hey, there.
You're coming on. I bet you're a real tiger in your neighbourhood.
Yeah. That's 'cause
I practise all the time.
Now, now, Toulouse.
Toulouse, come along, dear.
Yes, Mama.
See you around, tiger.
Now, that's quite a family.
Come to think of it, O'Malley, you're not a cat. You're a rat.
Right? Right.
- Hey, hey, hold up there.
- Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?
Now look, kids, if I said magic carpet, magic carpet it's gonna be.
And it's gonna stop for passengers... wright... here.
Oh, boy, we're gonna fly after all.
Another flight into the fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?
No, no, no, baby.
You just hide over there, and you leave the rest to J. Thomas O'Malley.
Quick, Mom, get in here.
- But, children...
- Hurry up, Mama, hurry.
One magic carpet, coming up.
That's a magic carpet?
Sacré bleu!
Sapristi! Stupid cat.
Brainless lunatic.
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you could have lost your life.
So I got a few to spare. Nothin'.
- How can we ever thank you?
- My pleasure entirely.
Aloha. Auf weidersehen.
Bonsoir. Sayonara.
And all those goodbye things, baby.
Sayonara, mister...
Mama!
Marie! Marie!
Oh, Marie, are you all right?
- Yes, Mama.
- Haven't we met before?
And I'm so very glad we did.
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley, for saving my life.
No trouble at all, little princess.
And when we get to Paris, I'll show you the time of your life.
Oh, I'm so sorry, but... we just couldn't.
You see, my mistress will be so worried about us.
Well, humans don't really worry too much about their pets.
Oh, no. You just don't understand.
She loves us very much.
Poor Madame, in that big mansion, all alone.
In all our days, in tender ways,
her love for us was shown.
And so you see, we can't leave her alone.
She'd always say that we're the greatest treasure she could own.
Because with us she never felt alone.
Oh, Roquefort, I've been so worried about you.
Did you have any luck at all?
Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou.
And I've searched all night.
I know. And poor Madame didn't sleep a wink, either.
Oh, it's a sad day for all of us.
Morning, Frou-Frou, my pretty steed.
Can you keep a secret, hmm?
Of course you can.
I have some news straight from the horse's mouth, if you'll pardon the expression, of course.
Look, Frou-Frou.
I've made the headlines.
"Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats."
Aren't you proud of me?
So he's the catnapper.
The police said it was a professional, masterful job.
The work of a genius.
Not bad, eh, Frou-Frou old girl?
Oh, they won't find a clue to implicate me.
Not one single clue.
Why, I'll eat my hat if they...
My hat!
My umbrella!
Oh, oh, gracious.
I've got to get those things back tonight.
But... oh, you...
Why, that... sneaky, crooked, no-good butler!
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?
- Where is it?
- Right under that magic carpet.
But now we have to cook up a little spell.
You know. Ready?
All right. First, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose.
And tickle your chin.
Now you close your eyes.
And cross your heart.
Then presto, breakfast à la carte.
Hooray!
- We did it.
- Look, Mama, look!
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you are amazing.
True.
True.
Sapristi!
Sacré bleu!
Thieves! Robbers!
Mangy tramps!
Take that and that!
Oh. Oh, what a horrible, horrible human.
Well, some humans are like that,
Duchess. I've learned to live with it.
I'll show him.
Hey, cool it, you little tiger.
- That guy's dynamite.
- But he called us tramps.
Oh, I'll be so glad when we get back home.
That's a long way off, so we better get moving.
Gee whiz.
Look at that bridge.
Come on, let's play train.
Now, be careful, children.
Marie's the caboose. All aboard!
Choo choo choo, choo choo choo.
Choc choo choo choo...
Clickedy, clickedy, clickedy, clickedy.
- Oh, no.
- Don't panic.
Down underneath here.
- Mama!
- Marie!
Oh, Marie!
Keep your head up,
Marie! Here I come!
Thomas! Thomas, up here.
Gee, Marie, why did you have to fall off the bridge?
Thomas! Oh, Thomas! Take care!
I'm all right, honey, don't worry.
I'll see you downstream.
What beautiful countryside, Abigail.
- So much like our own dear England.
- Indeed, yes.
Amelia, if I walk much farther I'll get flat feet.
Abigail, we were born with flat feet.
I say. Look over there.
Oh. Oh, how unusual.
Fancy that. A cat learning how to swim.
He's going about it all the wrong way.
Quite. We must correct him.
Sir. Sir?
You are most fortunate we happened along.
Yes. We're here to help you.
No, no. Back off, girls.
I'm doing fine.
First, you must gain self-confidence by striking out on your own.
Go away. I'm trying to get to shore.
You will never learn to swim properly with that willow branch in your mouth.
Indeed, not. Snip, snip.
Here we go.
Don't do that!
You're doing splendidly.
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.
Oh, he takes to water like a fish, doesn't he?
A very enthusiastic pupil!
No, no. This is no time for fun and games.
Gracious, Amelia.
- You don't suppose...
- Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
Bottoms up.
Deeper!
Look, Ma, there he is.
You really did quite well for a beginner.
Oh, Thomas. Thank goodness you're safe.
- Keep practising.
- And toodley-pip.
Can I help you, Mr. O'Malley, huh?
Help? I've had all the help I can take.
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so much for helping Mr. O'Malley.
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.
Yes, we British like to keep things proper.
Now, I am Amelia Gabble and this is my sister...
- Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.
You might say we're related.
How nice. I never would have guessed.
Look, they got rubber feet.
Yeah.
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.
- Swimming some of the way.
- On water, of course.
Thomas, this is Amelia and Abigail Gabble.
Yeah, honey, get those two web-footed lifeguards out of here.
Now, now, Thomas.
OK, OK, baby.
Hiya, chicks.
How awful.
We're not chickens. We're geese.
Nooo. I thought you were swans.
Oh! Oh, flatterer.
Your husband is very charming and very handsome.
Well...
Uh, you see, I'm not exactly her husband.
Exactly? You either are or you're not.
All right. I'm not.
Oh?
Hm.
- It's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.
Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.
- A roué.
- His eyes are too close together.
- Shifty, too.
- Look at his crooked smile.
His chin is very weak, too.
Obviously, a philanderer who trifles with unsuspecting women's hearts.
How romantic.
Please, please, let me explain.
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
- He's just helping us to get to...
- Come on, Duchess.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Well, girls, see you around.
- We're on our way to Paris.
- Oh, how nice.
- We're going to Paris ourselves.
- Why don't you join us?
I think that's a splendid idea.
Oh, no.
Now, uh, you stand here, dear.
And, uh, let's see.
You take this position.
- Duchess, you'll do nicely here.
- Very good.
And, you dear, you take this place.
Now, that leaves Mr. O'Malley.
We can't leave him, can we?
Mr. O'Malley, I think you should be the rear end.
Ready, everyone? Now, think goose.
Forward march.
Mama? Do we have to waddle like they do?
Yes, dear. Think goose.
When we get to Paris, you must meet Uncle Waldo.
Waldo?
Yes, he's our uncle.
We are to meet Uncle
Waldo at Le Petit Café.
Le Petit Café? Oh, that's that famous restaurant.
C'est magnifique.
Sacré bleu!
Oh, he bit my finger!
Get out. Go! Go, get out. Scram!
Good riddance!
Why! Why, it's Uncle Waldo.
Uncle Waldo!
Abigail! Amelia!
My two favourite nooses.
Uncle Waldo, I do believe you've been drinking.
Oh, dear. What happened to your lovely tail feathers?
Girls, it's outrageous.
Why, you won't believe what they tried to do to your poor old Uncle Waldo.
Look. Look at this.
"Prime country goose à la Provençale.
Stuffed with chestnuts"?
And "basted in... white wine".
Basted? He's been marinated in it.
Dreadful.
Being British, I would have preferred sherry.
Sherry! Sherry.
Oh! Oh, Uncle Waldo.
- You're just too much.
- You mean he's had too much.
- Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, dear?
We'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed.
I say, there... what's all the whispering about, huh?
- Shh!
- Oh! Whoo-hoo!
Now, now, now, girls.
Girls, don't shush your old Uncle Waldo.
Why, you'll wake up the whole neighbourhood.
- Sh. No!
- Neighbourhood!
Come along, Uncle Waldo.
Oh, jeez, I think we'd better be going.
Oh. Right-o, girls.
Birds of a feather must... together.
That's "stick together".
Oh, stick.
Shush.
You know something?
I like Uncle Waldo.
Especially when he's marinated.
Frou-Frou, here comes Edgar.
Hurry, Roquefort, hop aboard the motorcycle.
And for goodness sakes, do be careful.
Frou-Frou, tonight Operation
Catnapper will be completed.
Wish me luck. Fisherman's luck.
Bye, Frou-Frou. Oooh!
I... Whoa!
Lafayette. Lafayette.
Listen.
Oh, shucks, Napoleon, that ain't nothin' but a little old cricket bug.
It's squeaky shoes approaching.
Oh, cricket bugs don't wear shoes.
Hush your mouth.
Let's see.
They're Oxford shoes.
Size nine and a half.
Hole in the left sole, it sounds like.
- What colour are they?
- They're black...
Now, how would I know that?
Hey! Now the squeaking has stopped.
I still say it was a little old cricket bug.
I'm the leader.
I'll decide what it was.
It was a little old cricket bug.
I'll see ya in the morning, Napoleon.
That's my hat. I'm the leader.
Well, shoot fire.
Don't get sore at me.
I ain't done nothin'.
Ooh. Oh.
Ooh.
Mm, mm. That feels good, Lafayette.
That's all right.
Mm. Mm.
Mm-mmm.
Oooh.
A little lower and faster there.
I'm scratching as fast as I can.
Oooh. Right there. That's good.
Oooh.
It's so warm... and cosy.
- Oooh.
- Aaah!
Oooh.
What's going on? Lafayette, what in tarnation you trying to do?
Aw, I get blamed for everything.
Wait a minute. Where's my hat?
What? And somebody stole my bumbershoot.
Where's my beddy-bye basket?
Whoever it is, is gonna get it and get it good.
This time I get the tender part.
Hush your mouth. Now, come on.
Hey, Napoleon, it's them shoes again.
Yeah, yeah, I hear 'em.
Napoleon, I'm plumb goose-pimply scared.
Now, this is no time to turn chicken.
I got a feelin' this case is gonna bust wide open.
Whoo-hoo!
Did you see him?
No, no, he sneaked up behind me and tailgated me.
Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.
Shh. Listen.
Sounds like a one-wheel...
- A one-wheel what?
- You're not gonna believe this.
But it's a one-wheeled haystack.
Hey, there it go. Come on.
After it!
I got him, I got him, I got him!
Ow! That's me.
Whoa, whoa. Oh!
Get him, get him.
Ooh. Ow.
Well, c'est la guerre, Napoleon.
I guess you can't win 'em all.
Ow. Oooh, oooh.
Criminently!
But, Thomas, Madame will be so worried.
Are you sure we can't get home tonight?
Mama, I'm tired.
Me, too, and my feet hurt.
Look, baby, it's late and the kids are bushed.
I'll bet we walked a hundred miles.
I'll bet it's more than a thousand.
Now, now, darlings, cheer up.
Mr. O'Malley knows a place where we can stay tonight.
How much farther is it, Mr. O'Malley?
Keep your whiskers up, tiger.
It's just beyond that next chimney pot.
Well, there it is.
My own penthouse pad.
It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's peaceful and quiet.
Oh! Oh, no.
Sounds like Scat Cat and his gang have dropped by.
- Oh, friends of yours?
- Yeah, they're old buddies, and they're real swingers.
"Schwingers"?
What is a "schwinger"?
You know, not exactly your type, Duchess.
Maybe we'd better find another place, huh?
Oh, no, no, no. I would like to see your pad and meet your Scat Cat.
Well, OK.
Hey, Scat Cat, blow some of that sweet stuff my way.
Well, lookie here.
Big man O'Malley's back in his alley.
Swing on down here, daddy.
Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat.
Yeah.
Buona sera, paesano.
Welcome home, O'Malley.
Duchess, this is the greatest cat of them all.
Oh, I'm delighted to meet you, Monsieur Scat Cat.
Likewise, Duchess.
You're too much.
You are charming.
And your music is so...
So different, so exciting.
It isn't Beethoven, Mama, but it sure bounces.
Say, this kitten-cat knows where it's at.
Knows where what's at?

Happy dreams, my loves.
I'll bet they're on that magic carpet right now.
They could hardly keep their eyes open.
Such an exciting day.
It sure was, and what a finale.
Thomas, your friends are really delightful.
I just love them.
Well, they're kinda rough, you know, around the edges, but if you're ever in a jam, wham, they're right there.
And wham, when we needed you, you were right there.
That was just a lucky break for me, baby.
Oh, and thank you so much for offering us your home.
Oh. I mean, your pad.
It's very nice.
Well, now, wait a minute.
This is the low-rent district, remember?
No, no, no, I like it.
Well, all it needs is a little tidying up, and maybe a little feminine touch.
Well, if you're applying for the job, well...
Goody. Mother's going to work for Mr. O'Malley.
Boy. Your eyes are like sapphires.
Gee.
That's pretty corny though, huh?
Oh, no. Not at all.
Any woman would like it.
I-I mean... even little Marie.
Yeah.
All those little kittens, Duchess.
I love 'em.
And they are very fond of you.
- Yeah.
- Shh.
You know, they need...
Well, you know, a sort...
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.
Oh, Thomas, Thomas, that would be wonderful.
Darling, if only I could.
But why can't you?
Because of Madame.
I could never leave her.
But... But Madame's...
Well, she's just another human.
You're just her house pets.
Oh, no, no.
We mean far more to her than that.
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.
We just have to go home tomorrow.
Yeah.
Well, I guess you know best.
But I'm gonna miss you, baby.
And those kids...
Gee, I'm gonna miss them too.
Well, we almost had a father.
Yeah.
Let's go back to bed.
Good night, Duchess.
Good night, Thomas.
Hey.
Meow!
What a classy neighbourhood.
Dig these fancy wigwams.
Wigwams?
Are you sure we're on the right street?
Yes. Yes, let's hurry.
We're almost home.
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!
Oh, no. Edgar!
I've got to do something, quick.
Oh, ha.
Edgar, old chap, get used to the finer things in life.
Someday they're all going to be yours, you sly old fox.
Oh!
Oh, he got me.
Hooray! We're home.
Wait for me, wait for me!
Me first, me first!
- It's locked.
- Come on.
Let's all start meowing.
- It can't be them.
- The kittens.
Uh, why?
Don't come in!
Go away!
- Away!
- Look, there's Roquefort.
Hi, Roquefort!
He's glad to see us.
I don't know what to say.
I only wish that I...
Maybe just a short, sweet goodbye would be easiest.
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.
Bye.
So long, baby.
Don't come in. Look out for Edgar!
Duchess, wherever have you been?
Look out for the... sack.
Well... guess they won't need me any more.
You came back?
It just isn't fair.
Edgar? Edgar, come quickly.
Coming, Madame, coming.
I'll take care of you later.
Oh, Edgar, they're back.
I heard them. Hurry, hurry, let them in.
Duchess? Kittens?
Come here, my darlings.
Where are you?
- Come on.
- Uh, allow me, Madame.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
His name is O... what?
His name is O'Malley. O'Malley.
Abraham de Lacy, Giuseppe Casey...
Oh, never mind. Just run, move, go get him!
Yes, yes, I'm on my way.
I told you it was Edgar.
Aw, shut up, Toulouse.
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.
I'm afraid it was just the imagination of an old lady.
But I was so sure that I heard them.
I'm so sorry, Madame.
Mr. O'Malley!
Hey, stop!
Duchess. Kittens. In trouble.
Butler did it.
Duchess and kittens in trouble?
Look, you go get Scat Cat and his gang of alley cats.
Alley cats?
But I'm a mouse.
Look, I'm gonna need help.
- You mean, you want me...?
- Move!
Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you, and you won't have a bit of trouble.
No trouble, he said.
Well, that's easy for... for what's-his-name to say.
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.
What's a little swinger like you doing on our side of town?
Oh, please, I was sent here for help by a cat.
This is outrageous. It's crazy.
But honest! He told me just to mention his name.
So start mentioning name, rodent.
Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas.
Don't rush me.
His name is O'Toole.
I don't dig him. Strike one.
Oh, oh... O'Brien.
Strike two.
Oh, boy.
You believe me... don't you?
Keep talkin', mousey.
How about O...
Grady?
Huh?
Mousey, you just struck out.
Any last words?
Why did I listen to that O'Malley cat?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- Hold it, cats.
This little guy's on the level.
You're darn tootin'
I'm on the level.
We didn't mean to ruffle you, squeaky.
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.
Duchess and kittens are in trouble.
Come on, cats, we gotta split.
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!
Now, my little pesky pets, you're going to travel first class.
In your own private compartment.
All the way to Timbuktu.
And this time... you'll never come back.
Oh, no, we've got to hurry.
The baggage truck will be here any moment now.
Ooh!
Whoo-hoo. Oww!
Over there. They're in the trunk.
Quiet!
Everybody out of here, fast.
You are going to Timbuktu, if it's the last thing I do.
Well, Mac, this must be the trunk, eh?
Yup. And she goes all the way to Timbuktu.
Heave-ho.
Now, my pets, a little closer together.
Good. Good.
Look, Georges. What do you think?
Very good, very good.
But I think we should get on with the will.
Yes, yes, of course, but you know what to do.
Very well. Scratch one butler.
You know, Georges, if Edgar had only known about the will,
I'm sure he never would have left.
Duchess, it's wonderful to have you all back.
And I think this young man is very handsome.
Shall we keep him in the family?
Of course we will.
We need a man around the house.
And, Georges, we must be sure to provide for their future little ones.
Of course. The more the merrier.
Now, don't move.
Smile.
Say "cheese".
Did somebody say "cheese"?
Thank you.
Now, run along downstairs.
There's a surprise for you.
Adelaide, what's that music?
Sounds like a gang of swinging hepcats.
That's exactly what they are, Georges.
They're the start of my new foundation.
What foundation?
My home for all the alley cats of Paris.

Run!
Run for your life!
Oh! Keep away!
- Take it!
- Keep away!
- Take all of it!
- The monster took my shoe!
Candy!
Yay. Treats. I love treats.
- Felicia.
- Hi, daddy!
That was a nice grip you had on that big fat kid.
Farkle, excellent work with your teeth.
- Fergus, my lad...
- Daddy, daddy, daddy.
You're gonna have to work on your timing.
All in all, not bad for your first Halloween.
They're growing up so fast.
And look who got her first clump of hair!
Oh, did you see? Farkle got him in the ankle.
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.
Oh, that's all right, sweetie.
Mommy didn't get a scare this year either.
Fear not, my love. The night is still young.
Hold the phone. Who left the door open?
You don't think... someone's inside?
Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?
- Aah!
- Aah!
Booo!
Oh, wow... Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
Happy Halloween, everyone.
Oh, man.
You said this was gonna scare 'em!
Hey! I worked hard on this costume!
Oops. Heh heh!
Admit it, Shrek.
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
Donkey, ogres don't get scared.
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that will scare the pants off of you!
- Which would scare me.
- Oh, really?
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes! Stories to make your blood run cold!
- Yeah!
- Stories to terrify you.
- Yeah!
- And whoever shall last through the night shall be named the king of Halloween!
- I accept.
- We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
- Ja, wonderbar!
- Huzzah!
- Okay.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick or treaters.
- Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
Trick or treat.
Ahem. Ahem!
I shall begin.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
There was this crazy albino guy with a hook, and he lived in a mirror!
And if you even look at him, you'd wake up in bathtub full of ice with your kidneys gone!
Well... Hey, hold on.
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- Uh... What?
- You named the terms.
I name the place.
Okay, fine.
Where we gonna do this?
- Castle Duloc?
- Oh, ha ha.
Very funny, Shrek.
But this is where
Lord Farquaad lived!
Ja. Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost!
If you're all too scared to put on big boy pants and go in,
I'll just claim my winnings and be on my way.
Wait a minute!
We can last in there just as long as you can.
Fine. Come on then.
Hold up, Shrek.
You can't just go barging in some creepy, spooky joint like you own the place.
And why not?
It's not like there's anyone here to stop us.
I still don't know about this, man.
You know... Whole creepy house-of-wax vibe goin' on in here.
Look, it's that little thingy you love so much, remember?
Welcome to Duloc
It's a creepy town
What was once pristine
Now is all rundown
We will chop off your head
And then laugh when you're dead
Duloc is a creepy place
Come on in, what the heck
Fall right down, break your...
Face
Duloc is
Duloc is
Duloc is
A creepy place
"GET OUT"
- Ooh! Let's do that again.
- No!
Well, then...
This ought to be fun.
Pff. Fun. Yeah, right.
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
You know what, I just figured out what your costume is.
You came as a kiss-up!
All right, all right.
Buckle up, everybody.
The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed.
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes.
Oh! Oh! Pick me, pick me!
I have a scary story!
This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?
- 'Cause that's not scary.
- Actually...
If you look at it from my perspective...
Hey, guess what, Pinocchio, no one cares!
Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek,
'cause I've got a doozy... and it's all true!
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
I don't know, something about me being too into myself.
Blah, blah, blah, yack, yack, yack.
You? But you are so adorable.
I know!
That's what I keep telling her!
I need a good woman, Muffin Man.
Ah. I can help you, Gingy.
- How about this one?
- Aw, I dunno.
- You like her, huh?
- Nope. Weird hair.
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.
No! Don't like it!
Okay. Well, how about this one?
Yes! That's it!
Ah!
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.
Wait! More sugar.
But that is not the recipe.
Trust me, Muffin Man, this girl's gotta be real sweet.
I want someone who will love me forever.
I must warn you, Gingy.
No one has ever made cookies with this much sugar.
You are tampering with forces far beyond your comprehension!
Just put her in the oven!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha...
Ow!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey. I get a little privacy?
- Huh?
- Take a hike.
Oh, oui.
Oh, my gosh, I'm in love!
A cookie angel.
Wow!
And you're hot too!
Hello?
Hello?
Oh...
I guess it didn't work.
Ha ha!
Gingy, is it you?
The one I was made for?
Oh, we'll be together forever.
Sweet!
I can't see me
Loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you and you for me
So happy together
- Are ya happy, Gingy?
- You bet!
The time since I met you has been the best...
7 1/2 minutes of my life.
Good! Because this is only the beginning.
I'm going to love you and hold you and feed you and dress you
- and cling to you...
- Yeah...
Hang on to you and smother you with my love.
- Yeah...
- Forever and ever and ever
- and ever and ever...
- You know, it's gettin' a little stuffy in here.
You know, I might go get some air.
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, no...
Not without your umbrella.
- Come on!
- Here, let me get that.
Wait for me!
Sugar, could you just do me one small, little teensy favor?
Anything.
Could you leave me alone for like 30 seconds?
Anything but that.
You know, I forgot my gumdrop buttons.
Yeah! Could you run over there and get 'em for me, please?
Sure, I can. I'll be right back.
Gingy, Gingy...
Run, run, run, as fast as you can if you wanna remain a gingerbread man!
Oh!
- Oh, Gingy.
- Whaa...
I don't understand.
- I thought you were happy!
- Oh, well...
It's all my fault.
I should have tried harder!
No, no, no! Don't try harder!
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.
I can be pretty... really pretty!
- The girl of your dreams.
- Aah!
Remember?
Farewell!
Gingy!
Let go, Gingy!
Fall with me... so we can be together forever!
Here's a thought...
You let go!
Together!
Together fore...
Boy, what a night!
I'm so glad that is over with!
Oh! Oh, well.
Nothing lasts forever.
Together forever.
Aah!
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
What a nice surprise!
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
- Hey... So what's up?
- Together forever.
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever!
- Gosh, your eye is pretty!
Look, I know you're upset, so... Aah!
Why don't we just sit down... and discuss this?
Then... they ate me!
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I... I gotta go.
They're my ride.
Wait a minute.
If they ate you, how is it that you're still here?
Did you not say this was a true story?
Um...
You made it up, didn't ya?
I... hey, look!
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Aah!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell.
It was a dark and stormy night!
Hey... what the...
And we needed to find us some shelter!
This is my turn to tell a story.
Hey, hey. Shh!
The kindly innkeeper was warm and friendly.
She made me feel all bubbly inside.
My trusty sidekick here would love to freshen up.
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles!
But we are equals.
Oh, man. Of course we are...
The noble donkey reassured his clearly inferior sidekick.
I'm getting a little tired of this...
But before Puss could finish his thought, he decided to take a well-deserved tongue bath.
Wh... wh... wha... wha...
Well, as long as I am here.
But right then, danger came from behind.
Da-dum, da-dum
Da-dum, da-dum
And Puss was never seen again.
Ha ha. The End.
No! That's not how the story goes.
I was well aware of the approaching danger and went for my steel.
Don't worry, little buddy.
I'm here to save you!
Ohh. You're killing me.
It was Prince Charming!
He was packing heat, and he wanted revenge!
I want revenge!
He said. But before anyone could do anything...
Ba-bam!
It was awful and it was terrible, and it was really, really scary.
What? No! Go back!
Although the charming was fast,
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
Oh!
Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Whoa-oa-oa!
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me.
Instead, I... I... I woke up.
Yeah. That's right!
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
You know you're on the ceiling, right?
I will get you for this.
Oh! And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy!
Mercy? Please!
Said Puss with his last dying breath.
But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower!
Oh, my goodness!
Why would I do that?
Ha ha! And right behind you, there was danger!
- Oh, man.
- You were paralyzed!
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
It was packing heat, and it wanted revenge.
I want revenge!
The donkey ran.
But how far can you run when you are on a plate covered in butter wearing a pink tutu?
- No!
- And a sombrero.
- No!
- And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
No, please! Please,
I'll switch to pancakes!
- Aah!
- Num, num, num!
And the donkey was never seen again.
Hoo hoo hah hah hah hah hah!
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No. You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't!
- I did!
No! Anything but that!
No!
The End.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
Ha. It worked, didn't it?
Hmm. Who's next in our little contest?
Oh. Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
- Ha.
- Okay.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
Pff. Yeah, whatever.
Whoop. Pshh, pshh, pshh.
You had your chance. Now, then...
Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street... in this house.
A man had come as a last resort.
Because... no one else would go near the place.
Gah!
I hear you've been expecting me.
- You are the...
- That's right.
I am... the babysitter.
Yes, sir, yes, thank goodness you've come.
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've-a never seen anything like it.
Trust me, buddy.
I've got three little ogres at home.
This will be a piece of cake.
Father!
Father!
O... kay then.
Look, I'm-a tell you,
I tried every trick in the book.
- You see?
- "Once Upon a Time-Out"?
Oh, come on, now.
You're gonna listen to a goose?
Please, you... you don't understand.
It's like he's-a two different people.
What your kid needs is discipline, not a bunch of psychological mumble-jumble.
You just gotta walk in there, look him in the eye, and show him who's...
Please tell me he's an only child.
Bobba gone fishpeas.
Ba, ba, boo.
Um... Hello.
Whoo!
Well, here's your problem.
His head's not screwed on right.
When you wish upon a star, you get lots of stuff.
Well, I wish for a nice, quiet evening where you go to sleep and I raid the icebox.
Okay.
- Ow! Ow! Oh!
- Hey... Ah!
Oh! Ah!
Mm.
See? That was easy.
It's like I always say.
When it comes to good parenting, you have to be fair but firm.
You just show him that you mean business, and he's out of bed again, isn't he?
You never have this problem with sock puppets.
Aah! Oh!
All right. What's this all about?
Voices.
- Voices?
- Uh-huh!
In here!
Telling me what to do!
You have voices inside your head.
Sometimes.
And what kind of things do they tell you to do?
Oh!
Oh...
The early bird catches the worm!
What's gotten into this kid?
Hey... Ow! Hey!
Maybe you sing him a little song.
Come here, y... I...
Do I look like the kind of guy that knows a lullaby?
Sing!
Lullaby and good night
Close your big, creepy eyes
If you sleep, away I'll creep
And get out of here alive
Oh... You know, once you get past all the splinters and rope burns, he's actually kinda cute.
Now where did he go?
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush!
Now, there's something you don't see every day.
Aah! Aah!
Get him off! Get him off!
Aah!
Ooh...
Mm...
Come back here, you!
I regret nothing!
Ow! Ooh!
Ah! Oh!
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ah!
Ah... Ooh... Ahh...
Eew!
I'm too young to have termites!
I'm no termite, Pinocchio.
I'm a cricket.
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,
I'll always be in...
The End.
That wasn't me!
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ha ha. Ask anyone!
Okay, then.
Why don't we start by asking... your conscience!
Aah!
Uh, now who's cheatin'?
Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me.
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
Yeah, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost.
Ghost? What ghost?
Farquaad's ghost, of course.
As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
Hey, man, that was an accident.
And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend.
- You know that!
- Is it?
Okay, okay.
That's... that's just the wind.
Donkey!
And apparently, it knows my name!
That's very funny, Shrek, but I know it's you doing this.
Hey, I... I'm standing right here with you, Donkey.
No way! This place is not haunted by a ghost!
And when the sun comes up,
Donkey will be the new king of...
...it's right behind me, isn't it?
Aah!
- Donkey!
- Oh, my goodness!
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha! Ah...
Well, that's what I'd call a knight to remember.
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say...
Grab the kids, and let's get going.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
You probably won't see him for a month.
So what else have you got in your bag of tricks?
Hmm.
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
Hey!
I am not happy!

Long ago...
... in the early years of the Second Age...
... the great Elven-smiths
forged Rings of Power.
Nine for mortal Men.
Seven for the Dwarf-lords.
Three for the tall Elf-kings.
But then, the Dark Lord learned
the craft of ring-making...
... and made the Master Ring.
The One Ring to rule them all.
With the One Ring, Middle-earth is his
and he cannot be overcome.
As the last alliance of Men and Elves
fell beneath his power...
... he did not notice the heroic shadow
who slipped in.
It was Prince Isildur...
... of the mighty kings from across the sea...
... who took the Ring.
But because he did not destroy it,
the spirit of the Dark Lord lived on...
... and began to take shape and grow again.
But the Ring had a will of its own,
and a way of slipping from one hand...
... to be found by another, so that it
might at last get back to its master.
And there the Ring lay,
at the bottom of the Great River Anduin...
... for thousands of years.
During those years...
... the Dark Lord captured the nine Rings
that were made for Men...
... and turned their owners
into the Ringwraiths:
Terrible shadows under his great shadow...
... who roamed the world,
searching for the One Ring.
In time, the Ring was found.
Two friends were fishing
in the Great River one day.
- Give us that, Déagol, my love.
- Why, Sméagol?
Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it.
I have already given you more than I could afford.
I found this, and I'm going to keep it!
Are you indeed, my love?
He used the Ring for thieving,
and to find out secrets.
His own people began to despise
the wretched creature...
... and to call him Gollum.
Tortured and driven by the Ring,
he hid in dark caves...
... under deep mountains.
But the Ring
slipped off Gollum's finger, too.
And so it was that Bilbo found it,
during his travels with the Dwarves.
Thief, Baggins. Thief!
It stole our precious, our precious...
Our birthday present.
Thief, Baggins! We hates it forever!
It was Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit...
... who took the Ring back to the Shire,
his home.
Years later...
... Gandalf the Wizard, visited Bilbo
on his going-away birthday party.
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like...
...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
Frodo, I can see your uncle Bilbo hasn't changed much.
And though 111 years is far too short a time...
...to live among such admirable Bagginses and Boffinses, Grubbs...
...Chubbs, Brace-girdles, Goodbodies...
...Bolgers, Hornblowers and Proudfoots...
- Proudfeet!
...I regret to announce that this is the end.
I'm going away. I'm leaving. Now.
Goodbye.
Where did he go?
Oh, Gandalf.
Have you left the Ring for Frodo, as we agreed?
It's mine, I tell you! It's my own.
My precious!
It's mine now, and I shall keep it.
I won't give my precious away, I tell you.
Do not say that again!
Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.
All right, I will.
Seventeen years passed sleepily
in the Shire.
All right, just a minute!
Gandalf!
Greetings, Frodo.
Gandalf, it's really you!
Oh, it's been so long!
Seventeen years...
...since Bilbo left.
You look the same as ever, Frodo.
You look older, Gandalf.
Oh, I've been on a long journey.
It's the Ring, isn't it?
Bilbo's funny magic ring.
You always used to look like that when you talked about it.
Bilbo's "funny" ring, that makes you invisible?
- Give it to me, Frodo!
- Give you the Ring?
For a moment only.
Can you see any markings on it?
There are none.
It's quite a plain ring, really.
Well, then, look!
Wait. Do you desire it so much already?
No, but why ruin it?
Because it is altogether evil.
It will corrupt and destroy anyone who wears it...
...until he passes into the World of Shadows...
...under the power of Sauron:
The Dark Lord of Mordor!
Not Bilbo?
You are the one who has the Ring now.
- It's not even warm.
- No.
Not even a dragon's fire could harm that Ring.
"One Ring to rule them all
"One Ring to find them
"One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them"
I wish it need not have happened in my time.
So do I.
The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength of knowledge...
...to break all resistance, and cover all the lands in darkness.
He lacks the One Ring.
Maybe he doesn't know that it was found.
He knows, Frodo.
Gollum left his cave to follow the Ring himself...
...and the Dark Lord caught him in Mordor.
The Dark Lord knows what ring it was
Gollum found, and how he lost it again.
And he has heard of Hobbits at last, and of the Shire.
And he even has a name to think about...
...the name of Baggins.
Because of Gollum!
Oh, Gandalf, what am I to do?
What a pity that Bilbo didn't kill that vile creature when he had the chance!
Yes, it was pity.
Pity and mercy.
And now, Frodo, the decision lies with you.
What will you do with the One Ring?
I'll give it to you, Gandalf!
You're wise and powerful.
Well, will you not...
No! Do not tempt me.
I would wish to turn it to good, and it cannot be used so.
Meaning to be kind, I would become as terrible as the Dark Lord himself.
Do not tempt me!
I shall have such need of strength so soon.
Then I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it.
I ought to go away somewhere, alone.
But they won't bother the Shire if the Ring isn't here.
My dear Frodo...
...I am afraid you are right.
You'll have to go and leave the name of Baggins behind you.
That name is no longer safe.
Your new traveling name shall be:
Mr. Underhill.
What have you heard, and why did you listen?
Mr. Frodo, sir, don't let him hurt me, sir!
Don't let him turn me into anything unnatural.
Well?
Answer him, Sam.
Well, I heard a deal that I didn't rightly understand...
...about an enemy and rings, and about Elves, sir.
Why, I would dearly love to see Elves,
Mr. Frodo.
And so you shall, Sam.
So you shall. Indeed, you should go to the Elves first, to Rivendell.
Tell everyone you are moving away...
...to live in Buckleberry, with those cousins of yours, Pippin and Merry.
However you manage it, do it soon, by your birthday at the latest.
I should be back by then.
I must go south, to consult with the Wizard Saruman...
...the head of my order. Be careful, Frodo.
Me, go, sir? Me, go and see the Elves?
Oh, my! Hooray!
I have come for your aid,
Saruman the White, in troubled times.
The Nine are abroad.
Darkness approaches, the Black Riders!
Is that all the news you have for me then?
Is that not enough?
Sauron is moving at last!
We can deal with Sauron ourselves.
You and I, one way or another.
What talk is this?
What are you saying, Saruman?
It is time for us to choose.
A new age is upon us.
A new power is rising.
Nothing that Men or Elves or Wizards can do will avail against it.
Its enemies are utterly doomed, but its friends...
You are saying that we should join with Mordor?
With him?
Does that displease you?
Where is the Ring, Gandalf?
Why do the Black Riders search for it in the Shire?
Have you hidden it there?
Would you rather see the Dark Lord have it...
...or Saruman of many colors?
Neither of you will have it.
There is a third choice.
It is to remain here...
...until you tell me where the Ring may be found.
Saruman, if you do this...
...if you delay me here,
Sauron will surely get it then.
Then he will know his good servants...
...and his enemies.
Saruman!
Saruman!
I don't feel right going off without Gandalf,
Mr. Frodo.
I wish we could've waited, that I do.
So do I, Sam, but he said to leave as soon as we could.
And Merry and Pippin insisted on coming with us, as far as Bree, for the fun of it.
There's someone coming up ahead,
Mr. Frodo. I can hear a horse.
Good. I'm tired of looking at my cousins all day.
I think we should get off the road.
I don't want to be seen leaving the Shire.
But it might be Gandalf.
Then we'll surprise him. Hurry!
We're going with you, Frodo.
With me?
But how do you... Sam.
- But you gave your word.
- They already knew so much, Mr. Frodo.
Sam didn't tell us about the Ring, Frodo.
I saw Bilbo use it once, before he left, to hide from the Sackville-Bagginses.
And after that,
Pippin and I kept on the lookout...
...and we followed you.
We asked questions everywhere.
And we even wormed a few things out of Gandalf.
And you spied on me.
And Sam helped you.
And we spied on you.
But we meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo.
Don't you remember what Mr. Gandalf said?
"Take someone you can trust," he said.
- It doesn't seem that I can trust anyone.
- It all depends on what you want.
You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin, to the bitter end.
But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone...
...and go off without a word.
We're your friends, Frodo.
Bless you, you deceitful scoundrels.
Hooray!
Will we be stopping at Bree tonight,
Mr. Frodo?
I think so, Sam.
We all need a fireside and a bath, and a proper night's sleep in a real bed.
I do wish Gandalf were with us.
Maybe he'll be at the inn when we get there.
Maybe.
I think I'll go out for a sniff of air.
Mind yourselves. Don't forget:
You're supposed to be escaping in secret.
Oh, mind yourself! Don't get lost.
Be careful, Merry.
Quiet!
Quiet, all!
We have some visitors with us tonight, all the way from the Shire.
What was your name again, sir?
Mr. Underhill.
Mr. Underhill and his party.
Yes, Mr. Underhill, sing us a Shire song!
Well, a short one, then.
"There is an inn, a merry old inn
Beneath an old gray hill
"And there they brew a beer so brown
"With a fol-de-doo and a fol-de-da
"Hobbits all of the Shire are we"
Who's there?
Who's there?
"With a ping and a pang
The fiddle-strings broke
"The cow jumped over the Moon"
Where did he go?
What's going on here?
Take your magic tricks back to the Shire!
What's this place coming to,
I'd like to know?
Well, Mr. Underhill...
...frightening my customers and breaking my crocks with your acrobatics!
Very sorry, it's quite unintentional, a most unfortunate accident.
Well, you have put your foot in it this time.
Who are you?
I am called Strider.
- Everyone knows me here.
- Well, we don't!
You've been very careless so far,
Mr. Frodo Baggins.
My name is Mr. Underhill.
After your performance tonight, it won't matter what you're called.
The Black Riders will know who you are by morning.
They already know what you bear.
Who are you really?
I am Gandalf's friend.
He asked me to watch out for you.
Gandalf? Have you seen him?
Where is he?
I do not know.
We were supposed to meet him here, but I've had no word, no message.
It is the first time that I've ever feared for him.
Then we will have to go on by ourselves tomorrow.
To Rivendell?
You'd never get there. The Black Riders are watching the road night and day.
They will come on you in the wild, in some dark place, where there's no help.
I know the wild country.
I can take you to Rivendell by paths that are seldom trodden.
Will you have me?
With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no.
This Strider, he says be more careful,
I say, let's start with him.
How do we know he's from Gandalf?
More likely, he's a playacting spy, working for...
- For them.
- I don't know, Sam.
I think one of the Enemy's servants would, well...
...seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.
While I look foul and feel fair, is that it?
Well, no, I meant...
Frodo!
Frodo, I've seen them!
I've seen them, Frodo!
I've seen them! Black Riders!
My men found him lying in the street.
There were two of them.
They were hissing to each other.
I seemed to be drawn towards them.
Well, you do need looking after, all of you.
There's been strange folk about for days.
That Ranger...
...Strider coming and going and... Strider!
- They've come from Mordor.
- Save us!
They won't trouble you once I am gone.
Strider came to offer me his help.
You know your own business, maybe...
...but in your place, I wouldn't take up with a ranger out of the wild.
They have no choice.
There is no one else for them except a fat innkeeper...
...who only remembers his name because people shout it at him all day!
I'll do what I can to help, Mr. Baggins.
Mr. Underhill.
I'm no hero, but I'll do what I can.
Keep watch tonight, you and your folk.
There is a hill called Weathertop...
...about half way between here and Rivendell.
We will make for it tomorrow.
So will Gandalf, if he can.
I still don't know if we can trust him,
Mr. Frodo.
I said, you have no choice, Sam.
Because, if I wanted the Ring for myself...
...I could have it, now.
My name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
If by life or death I can save you, I will.
How long will we be in these marshes, Aragorn?
At least two days.
I'm being eaten alive!
What do these things live on when they can't get Hobbits?
Easy there, Bill, easy, slow.
That is Weathertop.
We shall be there by nightfall, if we set a good pace and don't stop for lunch.
If this continues I'll become a wraith.
Don't speak of such things.
Aragorn! Aragorn!
And Beren was a mortal man...
...but Luthien Tinúviel was the daughter of a king of Elves...
...and she was the fairest maiden that has been among all the children of this world.
Yet she chose to be mortal, for him.
And when he died, she followed him.
And so he was her doom...
...but he was her love as well.
I thought I saw something!
Or maybe just shadows in the moonlight,
I don't know.
Just stand close to the fire. Make a circle.
What's that?
The Ring, Frodo! Take off the Ring!
Cold... It's so cold.
- Like a poisoned icicle.
- It is the cold of their world, Frodo.
When you put on the Ring, you entered the world of the Black Riders.
Gandalf said not to.
Why is it so misty here?
I can't see very well.
Well, what's the matter with him?
It was only a little wound.
It was an evil knife that struck him, Sam.
I think that a piece broke off in the wound and is working inward.
If it reaches his heart...
Can you do anything?
We must get to Rivendell very soon.
He can't go no further.
He must! Do you want them to take him?
Wait, listen.
Legolas!
Yes, Sam, that's an elf.
So, there has been no word of Gandalf in Rivendell? No message at all?
None.
My Lord Elrond has sent every rider he could spare to seek for you...
...knowing that you bore a great burden without guidance.
I have been on the road for nine days.
Well, Mr. Frodo has been on the road a lot longer than that.
And he's sick and he needs a rest.
Just for a while.
No resting can help your Mr. Frodo now.
Only the hands of Elrond in Rivendell can do that.
There are five Black Riders close behind us...
...and we may well find the other four waiting at the ford.
If we lose even a little time, we lose, Frodo, the Ring...
...and Middle-earth.
Do you understand me, Sam?
There is the ford of Rivendell.
Fly! The Enemy is upon us!
Come back. To Mordor we will take you.
Gandalf!
Come back, come back.
To Mordor we'll take you.
Come back, come back.
To Mordor, we'll take you.
Go back!
Run, you fool, run!
The Ring!
The Ring!
Go back to the land of Mordor, and follow me no more.
Come back. Come back.
To Mordor we will take you.
Come back. Come back.
Go back!
The Ring.
The Ring!
By all the Shire, you shall have neither the Ring nor me!
No, never. Verily, I come.
I give it unto you.
No, never! Gandalf!
Yes.
I am here, and you are lucky to be here, too...
...after all the absurd things you've done since you left home.
Where's Sam?
And are the others all right?
They've hardly left your side for three days.
Three days?
What happened at the ford?
It all seemed so dim, somehow.
You were beginning to fade, my remarkable friend.
The knifepoint had almost worked its way to your heart.
Oh, I didn't know. Would I have...
You would have become like them.
One of the Ringwraiths...
...the servants of the Dark Lord...
...if you had not resisted to the last.
The river, it rose up against them.
It is Elrond's river.
This is his house and it was Elrond himself who healed you.
If I may say so,
I added a few touches of my own.
The white horses and so on.
If you noticed.
Then that is the end of the Black Riders?
Not so long as the Ring itself exists.
They will fly back to their master in Mordor, empty and crippled...
...until they find new shapes to wear and new beasts to ride.
We have beaten them, just for a while, Frodo.
That's sort of a relief.
I wish that were the truth, Frodo.
I'm afraid we have a new and closer problem at hand.
You have not asked me why I was late getting back to the Shire.
I forgot.
When I was certain that yours was indeed the Master Ring...
... I rode at once to Isengard,
and I thought...
... that if anyone could know
what was best to do with the One Ring...
... it would surely be Saruman the White.
The great eagle, Gwaihir...
... came in answer to my call,
and bore me away.
Saruman has never paid enough
attention to animals.
- But if he should seize the Ring...
- He will become master of all Middle-earth.
The War of the Ring has begun, Frodo.
You will hear the rest in Council when you are well enough. Rest now.
"The leaves were long, the grass was green
"But the hemlock-umbels tall and fair
"And in the glade a light was seen
"Of stars in shadow, shimmering
"Tinúviel was dancing there"
Bilbo!
Hello, Frodo, my lad.
Where have you been?
Why haven't I seen you before?
I've seen a good deal of you, sitting by your side with Sam each day.
Bilbo, have you been here all the time?
All these years?
There didn't seem much reason to be anywhere else, after all.
The food's very good, and I listen, and I think.
A remarkable place altogether.
Yes.
And now, of course, there's all this bustle about that ring of mine.
Fancy the little thing causing such a disturbance. Have you got it here?
Yes, I have.
I'd very much like just to peep at it again, just for a moment.
Put it away.
I understand now.
I'm sorry.
Sorry about everything.
Don't adventures...
...ever have an end?
The Council of Elrond is beginning.
Come with me.
Both of you.
All that morning, the Council of Elrond
debated the history of the One Ring...
... and its master, Sauron.
Gandalf also told all present of Saruman...
... the traitor, and his desire
for the power of the Ring.
Elves and Dwarves, in their turn,
told what they knew of Sauron's...
... preparations for conquest,
and so did Boromir of Gondor.
In Gondor, we are already under attack by the forces of Mordor.
I am Boromir. In a dream...
...I heard a voice crying to me, saying:
"Seek for the sword that was broken."
Here is the sword of Elendil of Gondor...
...who fought the Dark Lord long ago and was slain.
So, Frodo learned at last...
... the true heritage of Aragorn,
the son of Arathorn...
... descendent of Isildur,
who cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand.
Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all?
Bring out the Ring, Frodo.
The time has come.
Isildur's Bane.
The Halfling.
What shall we do with it then, this mightiest of all weapons?
We cannot keep it, we cannot destroy it.
Sauron, who forged it looks for his Ring...
...and Saruman who envies it, searches for its power, too.
I see no other road for us but the most fearful:
The road into Mordor.
We must send the Ring to the fire where it was made:
To Mount Doom.
What foolishness is this?
Why do you speak of hiding and destroying?
The Ring could save all Middle-earth.
Have you heard nothing?
It is Sauron's Ring. To wield it...
...you would have to become Sauron.
I will not touch it!
Nor I.
Our one hope lies in foolishness, Boromir.
The Dark Lord cannot conceive of anyone wishing to destroy his Ring.
He will wait until one of us tries to use it...
...follow every move we make.
And it is just possible that he may not notice...
...the small, quiet feet, walking into peril...
...into Mordor.
Very well. It's plain enough what you're pointing at.
Bilbo, the silly Hobbit, started this affair, and had better finish it, or himself.
When ought I to start?
It has passed beyond you, Bilbo.
This last journey must be for others to make.
Who are they to be?
That is what they're trying to decide here.
I will take the Ring...
...though I do not know the way.
I think that this task is appointed for you, Frodo.
This is the hour of the Shire-folk, at last.
But you won't send him off alone, surely?
You, at least, shall go with him,
Master Samwise.
It is impossible to separate you, even when he is summoned to a Council...
...and you are not.
A nice pickle we've landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo.
I thought perhaps you might care to have these.
Bilbo, I don't think I should look right.
You can wear the shirt under your clothes.
It's as light as anything.
But I fancy it might turn...
...even the knives of the Black Riders.
I named the sword Sting, long ago.
It's silly, but there you are.
It shines when there are enemies about.
Orcs and things.
There. Now you look just a plain Hobbit on the surface...
Well, take care.
Bring back any old songs and tales you hear.
"I sit beside the fire
"And think of all that I have seen"
Our only hope is in speed and secrecy.
The Company of the Ring shall be nine.
Nine walkers against
the nine Riders of Mordor.
With Sam and Frodo, Gandalf will go.
For the other Free Peoples...
... Legolas shall be for the Elves,
and Gimli, son of Glóin, for the Dwarves.
For Men shall go the valiant...
... Boromir of Gondor,
and Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
And for the last two places,
we will trust to friendship...
... rather than to great wisdom,
Peregrin Took...
... and Meriadoc Brandybuck may also go.
When did you ever know such a storm, so far south?
The Dark Lord's arm has grown long if he can hurl snow at us...
...all the way from Mordor.
His arm has grown long.
No, Gandalf, not that dark way, I beg you!
And what would you suggest?
Returning to Rivendell to wait there for the end? We have no choice, Aragorn!
We might go by way of the Gap of Rohan.
That'd take the Ring too close to Isengard and Saruman. We dare not risk it.
Yet you would risk the mines of Moria.
Where both you and I have walked before and come out again alive.
The memory is very evil.
I do not wish to enter Moria a second time.
And I don't wish to enter it even once.
Nor me.
The question is not who wishes to go, but who will?
There is no other way to pass the mountains.
I will go with you.
My cousin Balin led a company of Dwarves there, many years ago.
There has been no word of them in all that time.
Elves do not walk in the dark earth.
I will go, but I fear for you, Gandalf.
I will not go, not unless the vote of the whole company is against me.
What does the Ring-bearer say?
I do not wish to go.
But I will go, if Gandalf advises it.
Steady, easy, Bill. Old Gandalf will have that gate open in a minute.
- What if he can't?
- I've never seen anything he couldn't do.
Sam!
Fireworks are all very nice, but this is elf magic.
What a people you Dwarves are for hiding things.
On the gates of your most wondrous, ancient kingdom you write:
"Speak, friend, and enter," and no spell in any language can open the door.
Why do you keep looking at the lake, Frodo?
I'm afraid of it.
And there sits our quest.
If we had to bring a wizard at all...
...it should have been Saruman.
Be still, Boromir.
Why? There are other ways to turn, if our Wizard's balked.
I said, from the beginning...
Gandalf, you old fool!
So, all you had to do was say, "friend," and enter.
Those were happier times.
Let us go.
I'm coming, Mr. Frodo! I'm coming!
Into the gateway! All of you!
Poor old Bill!
Gandalf, what was the thing in the water?
I do not know.
There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world.
Whatever it was, it grabbed Frodo first, out of all of us.
Be quiet, Pippin!
We have gone far enough for today.
Let us stop here for the night.
Seems to have been a guardroom.
Yes, there's even a well.
We had better rest here.
It's hard to believe that even Dwarves...
...could have lived in this half-drowned dungeon!
It was a great realm once.
Be still! Both of you!
Which way do we take tomorrow, Gandalf?
I have not decided.
The path to the left smells foul, and I am too weary to choose.
The way ahead feels wrong, somehow.
At least the middle way goes up.
It's time we began to climb again.
Perhaps. I cannot remember.
What's that?
- Pippin!
- Just a stone.
I dropped a stone.
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time! Be quiet!
Fool of a Pippin!
Yes, this way.
We should find our way down to the Great Gates by tonight.
I shall be glad.
I doubt now that Dwarves ever came back here.
Why should they have come back?
What was left for them to mine?
Mithril silver!
The most precious metal in the world.
"Balin, son of Fundin...
"...Lord of Moria."
They did come back.
It seems to be a record of the colony.
Orc swords. There was a great battle here.
Yes.
"Balin is now Lord of Moria."
Here it says, "We found Mithril."
Now it says:
"Yesterday, Balin, Lord of Moria, fell.
"An Orc shot him from behind a stone.
"We slew the Orc, but many more..."
Then it says, "We have barred the gates."
And something about,
"The Watcher in the Water."
- What do you hear?
- Nothing.
But I feel.
It is grim reading.
"They have taken the bridge.
They are coming!
"We cannot get out!
Drums, drums in the deep!"
There is nothing more.
Gandalf? I don't want to stay here.
We are going now, Pippin.
There is nothing more.
They are coming.
Slam the doors and wedge them.
Keep the east door ajar.
We must not get shut in.
Orcs and something else.
A great Cave-troll, I think.
Out this way!
The Shire!
For the Shire!
Now is the last chance! Run for it!
I'm all right. I can walk.
I thought you were dead.
All of you, down the stairs!
Lead the way, Gimli!
Pippin and Merry next.
Come no closer! I warn you!
Balrog!
Fly, all of you!
Fly, up the stairs and straight on.
Fly! You cannot help me.
You cannot pass.
I am a servant of the Secret Fire.
You cannot pass.
Go back to the shadow.
You cannot pass.
Fly, you fools!
Come. Follow me.
Obey him!
- There may be a bit of a scar, Sam.
- I don't care.
Now it is your turn, Frodo.
I'm all right. What does it matter now?
It matters. We still have a long road, and much to do.
Why? We've no hope without Gandalf.
You know that, Aragorn.
Then we must do without hope.
There is always vengeance.
Mithril shirt!
That's what saved you.
I have never seen one so beautiful.
- There!
- What is it?
The footsteps,
I heard them in Moria, following.
The Orcs will not come after us until dark.
It never sounds like an orc.
They're bare feet and they flap.
Whatever creature it is, it won't follow us where we're going.
Nothing evil passes through Lothlorien.
- That is not what we say in Gondor.
- Then you know nothing in Gondor.
Out of Moria into the Golden Wood.
Is there no way less perilous?
I would almost rather face the Balrog again, than the Lady.
Lothlorien is a place of healing.
There is no evil in it, unless a man...
...brings evil there with him.
- Welcome to Lothlorien.
I am Galadriel and this is my lord, Celeborn.
The forests have told us of your loss.
We sorrow for you, and for all of Middle-earth.
Rest here now for a little, until you are healed.
Your quest is known to us.
We will do what we can to aid you.
Frodo Baggins of the Shire?
"Let the night never cease to call you
"Let the day never more be the same"
It is a song about Gandalf, isn't it?
Yes, Mithrandir was the Elves' name for him.
It means, Grey Pilgrim.
We knew so little of him in the Shire,
Aragorn. He was just Gandalf, to us.
We never knew he had so many names.
I think he was fondest of Gandalf.
"We're still guided by your light
"You're walking beside us
"A prayer in the night
"With the fear rushing through the shadows
"Like a star shining deep in his heart
"You will know in your hearts forever
"Never more
"Will we stand
"Alone"
This is the mirror of Galadriel.
It shows things that were, and things that are...
...and things that yet may be.
Do you wish to look?
I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home.
It seems a terrible long time
I've been away.
Come then, you shall look...
...and see what you may.
I got to go home!
They've dug up Bagshot Row...
...and thrown my poor old Gaffer out in the street.
I've got to go home.
The mirror shows many things, Sam, and not all have yet come to pass.
Some never come to be, unless those that behold the visions...
...turn aside from their path to prevent them.
Do you wish to leave Frodo now, and go home?
No.
Gandalf?
No, it must be Saruman.
Do not touch the water.
He is looking for you.
But he cannot find you, not here, not yet.
The door is closed.
"Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky."
Yes.
We hid those three from him, and he has never touched them.
If your quest fails, then nothing can stand...
...against him and we are defenseless.
Yet, if you succeed, if the One Ring is destroyed...
...all we built with the three will fade.
Time will come here, and Lothlorien will fade.
You are the footstep of doom to us, Frodo.
Lady Galadriel, I will give you the One Ring, if you ask for it.
It's too great a matter for me.
And I came to test your heart.
You will give me the Great Ring freely...
...and in place of the Dark Lord you will set up a queen.
And I shall not be evil, but beautiful...
...and terrible as the morning and the night.
Stronger than the foundations of the earth.
All shall love me and despair!
I pass the test.
I will diminish and go into the west...
...and remain Galadriel.
And you must depart in the morning.
For Gondor and the House of Isildur.
For Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith.
In a few days, we will have to choose:
Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor...
...or turn east to Mordor and its Dark Lord?
Or shall we break our fellowship?
I'm going with Mr. Frodo.
I know that, Sam.
What a place. What a horrible place!
Behold the Argonath, the pillars of the kings.
They are Isildur and Anarion, my fathers of old.
If Gandalf were here...
The day has come at last, the day of choice, which we have long delayed.
What shall now become of our company?
I am not Gandalf.
I have tried to guide you as he would've done, but...
...if he had any plan for this moment, he never told me.
Even if he had, if he had lived...
...I think the burden would still have fallen on you, Frodo.
You alone can choose your way now.
The burden is heavy.
Give me an hour longer, and I will speak.
Let me be alone!
You shall have your hour.
And you shall be alone.
Who's there?
Boromir.
I was afraid for you, Frodo.
The Orcs may be on this side of the river by now.
May I stay and talk to you, just for a while?
You're kind, but there's nothing to be said.
I know what I should do, but I'm afraid of doing it, Boromir.
I wish I could help you.
Will you hear my counsel?
I know what your advice would be:
To go with you to Gondor and use the Ring to defend Minas Tirith.
And is that such ill counsel?
Why should we fear to use the Ring in a just cause?
Whatever is done with the Ring turns to evil.
Gandalf and Elrond refused to touch it, and Galadriel herself...
Yes, I know all that.
And for themselves, they may be right, these Elves and half-Elves and Wizards!
But truehearted Men will not be corrupted.
We, of Minas Tirith, do not seek power.
Only the strength to defend ourselves.
Where is the evil in that, Frodo?
You cannot answer me, none of them can.
It's folly not using the Enemy's power against him.
Think what Aragorn could do with the Ring in this hour.
Or if he refuses, why not Boromir?
How I would drive the hosts of Mordor, until I stood face to face with Sauron.
And they tell us to throw it away!
Come with me, Frodo.
My city is not far.
You can go to Mordor from there, if you must.
Only, trust me, let me try my plan.
Lend me the Ring.
No, Boromir. No!
Fool, obstinate fool!
It is only yours by chance.
It might have been mine.
It should be mine. Give it to me!
Miserable trickster!
You'll sell us all to Sauron.
Traitor!
Curse you to death and darkness, all you Halflings!
What have I done?
Frodo, come back!
A madness took me, but it has passed.
Come back!
This waiting's horrible.
Where have you been, Boromir?
Have you seen Frodo?
I tried to convince him to come to Minas Tirith.
I grew angry and he vanished.
Is that all you have to say?
He put the Ring on.
But where did he go? Where is he?
Mr. Frodo!
Gimli, Legolas, stop them!
I don't know what part you've played in this mischief, but help now!
Go after Merry and Pippin and guard them, even if you cannot find Frodo. Go on!
Follow me, Sam. Stay close.
Sam Gamgee, your legs are too short, so use your head.
The boats.
Coming, Mr. Frodo.
Coming!
It's only water, now.
I'm here, Sam.
Save me, Mr. Frodo.
Help, I'm drowning!
- Take my hand.
- Where's your hand?
Here. Here it is.
Of all the confounded nuisances
I ever knew.
Mr. Frodo, that's hard.
If I hadn't guessed right, where would you be now?
Safely on my way.
"Safely"?
All alone and without me to help you?
But I am going to Mordor.
Well, of course you are,
Mr. Frodo, and I'm coming with you.
It's no good trying to escape you.
I'm glad, Sam.
May the others find a safe road.
Aragorn will look after them.
I don't suppose we shall see them again.
Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may.
- This way!
- Frodo!
Halfling.
Boromir.
Boromir.
I tried to take the Ring from Frodo.
I'm sorry. I have paid.
Aragorn, go to Minas Tirith.
Save my people.
Aragorn...
I will go...
...I promise you.
The Halflings, Orcs took them.
I think they are not dead.
Either we take the last boat and follow
Frodo, or we follow the Orcs on foot.
Pippin and Merry may be dead by now.
We don't know.
We cannot forsake them.
The fate of the Ring-bearer is in my hands no longer.
The Company of the Ring has played its part. We follow the Orcs.
Filth!
Maggots!
Can't run.
Hello, Pippin.
So you've come on this expedition, too?
When do we get bed and breakfast?
Bed and breakfast in Isengard, understand?
They are alive.
One of them, anyway.
Pippin, I think, by the footprints.
How far ahead of us are they, Aragorn?
Almost a day. Shall we rest by night, or go on while our strength holds?
Do you think the Orcs will rest?
Yet, in the dark we may lose the trail, or miss a sign, like that brooch.
There will be no more signs.
I cannot run all the way to Isengard.
Thank goodness for that rope the Elves gave you.
We'd never have gotten down that last cliff without it.
There's Mount Doom again, Mr. Frodo.
See it?
What a fix!
The one place that we don't want to see any closer...
...and that's the one place we're trying to get to.
We're plain lost, Mr. Frodo.
I'm tired, Sam.
I don't know what's to be done.
We must find a place to camp, I suppose.
Maybe there'll be a path tomorrow.
Cautious, my precious.
Don't turn!
It's him.
That Gollum?
That thing who had Mr. Bilbo's ring?
He's been following us since Moria.
My precious! More haste, less speed.
Well, he'll be sorry he found us again.
Be careful!
He's much more dangerous than he looks.
Where is it, my precious?
It's ours, it is, and we wants it.
Got you, you spying...
Let go, Gollum!
Let go, or I'll cut your throat!
Don't hurt us!
Don't let them hurt us, precious.
Cruel little Hobbitses.
Jumps on us like cats on poor mices, Gollum.
We'll be nice to them if they'll be nice to us, won't we, precious?
Pity Mr. Bilbo didn't kill the creature when he had the chance.
I will not touch him.
Now that I see him, I do pity him.
Yes, Hobbits won't kill us, not Hobbits, huh?
No, we won't.
But we won't let you go, either.
You will have to come with us and help us, if you can.
Yes, indeed!
Nice Hobbits!
And where are they going in these cold, hard lands, we wonder?
We are going to Mordor. You know that.
Lead us to the gates of his land.
No, precious.
Hobbits mustn't go there.
Gollum! Leave us alone!
Gotcha!
I think your rope might prove useful again.
Tie one end to his ankle.
We want him to walk.
Don't hurt us! No!
It burns! It bites!
It freezes!
Take it off us. It hurts us.
Don't you do it!
It hurts us.
What promise can you give me that I can trust?
Sméagol will be very good.
Sméagol will swear never to let him have it.
Sméagol will save it.
The precious is before you, Sméagol.
Speak your promise!
We promises, yes, I promise...
...I will serve the master of the precious.
- Good master.
- Good Sméagol.
Take the rope off, Sam.
Off we go. Follow Sméagol.
Sméagol knows a secret way, he does, across the marshes.
Follow Sméagol.
I said, "No shooting."
You're wasting arrows, dunghill swine!
Snaga, Lugdush, stand guard.
Bind their legs.
White-skins break through. Understand?
You and your stinking Wizard.
You got us into this.
When I tell them in Mordor...
They are far, far away.
If stinking Wizard doesn't get you, the white-skins will.
You won't get it that way.
It isn't easy to find.
Get it? Get what?
Nothing, my precious.
It's no good groping in the dark.
Ugluk will be back any minute.
Nothing for Mordor.
Nothing for poor Grishnakh and Gollum.
- Untie us, my precious.
- I said to be quiet!
Wait. You can't find it without our help.
You help me.
I don't know what to do now.
I don't even know where we are.
You should have studied maps more and played less in Rivendell.
This is Fangorn Forest.
Then we're no safer than we were with the Orcs.
We've no blankets and almost no food.
It looks like nothing to eat for 100 miles.
We don't even know where we're trying to go.
Let's climb up there.
Maybe we can find out where we are, at least.
It's nice here.
The forest looks so different in the sunlight.
I know.
It's funny, but, well,
I almost feel I like the place.
Almost felt you liked the forest?
That's uncommonly kind of you.
The Orcs made us run here, and when we tired...
...they carried us, cut our ropes and ran into the forest and we came to your hill...
"Hill?"
A hasty word...
...for something that has stood here since the world was shaped.
You may call me Treebeard.
We thought you were a tree, standing there.
Not a tree, a tree herder.
Please, Treebeard...
...now that you know our story...
...whose side are you on?
I am not altogether on anybody's side...
...because nobody is altogether on my side.
But I am no friend of these...
...tree-killing Orcs and their masters.
They were here, no doubt of it.
- But where they went...
- I don't understand these other marks.
Look!
Your bow, Legolas! It's Saruman.
- Shoot before he puts a spell on us, fast!
- Elf...
...Man and Dwarf together?
A rare sight in these times.
Stop him, Legolas!
Gandalf?
Beyond all hope.
Gandalf!
Yes.
That was my name.
But where have you... Gandalf!
What happened?
A long time I fell.
Long I fell and he fell with me.
His fire was about me.
I was burned.
Ever he clutched me, and ever
I hewed him, far under the living earth...
... until at last, he fled back up
the secret ways of Moria.
There we fought,
above the mists of the world...
... and the mountain was wreathed
with lightning.
I threw down my enemy
and his fall broke the mountainside.
Then darkness took me...
... and I wandered far,
on roads that I will not tell.
Naked, I was sent back for a brief time...
...until my task was done.
And it is time I was about it.
You come with me to Edoras, my friends, to the city of the Riders?
To Edoras, now?
But to leave Merry and Pippin?
They are in no danger, believe me.
The great danger is to Edoras.
Saruman's Orcs will attack there within
two days, and Theoden has need of us.
Theoden has grown old.
He shivers by his fire now...
... and leaves everything in the hands
of his new minister:
Grima Wormtongue.
Those Riders you followed,
who rescued Merry and Pippin...
... they were led by Theoden's nephew,
Eomer.
He is all but an outlaw
in Rohan these days.
He hunts the Orcs
wherever he finds them...
... defying Wormtongue's orders
to let them pass.
So Wormtongue calls him traitor
and renegade...
... and Theoden believes...
Gandalf, the Riders of Rohan
are the bravest fighters...
... but they were never many.
If Saruman strikes now,
he'll overrun Edoras in a single night.
Our time is at hand.
Theoden's hundreds will face your tens of thousands.
When all of Rohan, your ancient oppressor, lies vanquished...
...then shall we fly eastward...
...and sweep all of Middle-earth beneath our feet.
We cannot be defeated!
Halfway between Edoras and Isengard,
there lies a fortress called Helm's Deep.
If we can decoy Saruman's Orcs there...
... the fortress will stop them longer
than the wooden halls of Edoras.
We are buying time, Aragorn.
Time? Time for what?
Perhaps for a miracle.
Perhaps only for Frodo to get a little further on his way...
...while the armies that should be hunting for the Ring...
...waste their own time destroying us.
I have returned.
The storm comes swiftly, and it is time for all friends to gather together.
And...
...do you...
...expect me...
...to welcome you here...
...Master Gandalf?
Troubles follow you like crows.
Why should I welcome you,
Gandalf Stormcrow?
Justly spoken, Lord.
In the east, the Dark Lord is stirring...
...in Lorien, the Sorceress of the Golden Wood weaves deceit.
And such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return.
It is I...
...who counsel the King now.
He hears you no longer.
No, Grima Wormtongue.
He hears nothing but your voice telling him that he rules here...
...only because Saruman is kind to old men...
...and that the best thing for a sickly, feeble king...
...is to let Wizards and Orcs do as they will in Rohan.
I am my own man, Gandalf...
...as I was.
It is true that...
...Grima advises me often to leave
Saruman in peace...
Hear, my Lord, you tire yourself.
You are still unwell.
And he does remind me that it would be safest for Rohan...
...to seek their friendship...
...no matter how I may feel!
Dear Lord, let me deal with these troublesome guests.
How long has it been, Grima Wormtongue?
How long since Saruman bought you?
For I saw you at Isengard.
Did I not counsel your doorkeeper to forbid his staff?
Down, snake.
Down on your belly.
Grima is often...
...at Isengard.
I sent him there with messages.
And he returns with poison...
...Saruman's poison in your ears, Theoden.
Chilling your heart, making you old.
Take courage, Lord of Rohan!
Grima...
...is this so?
I will not harm you, Grima.
Is it so?
Let him go!
My sister-daughter, Eowyn.
My only loyal kin...
...since her brother has disobeyed my commands.
Wormtongue's command, Theoden.
If Eomer had not defied him...
...their cause might be already lost.
- Tell me, Gandalf...
...what I must do now.
We cannot wait here for Saruman's attack.
Every man that can ride must be sent immediately...
...to the old fortress of Helm's Deep.
When Saruman learns that we have gone there, and he will...
...we will have the Riders of Rohan.
I will find Eomer and his Riders.
My armor!
Look for me at Helm's Deep.
That's all, Theoden.
And he's gone again...
...like a wind in the grass.
Stormcrow.
- Aragorn?
- My Lord?
Is there any hope for us?
Sam, you simpleminded...
You fell asleep.
Mr. Frodo, he's gone.
- Sméagol?
- He's gone. I didn't mean to sleep.
Well, he'll come back.
Promise will hold him a while yet.
He won't leave his precious, anyway.
Are we rested?
Ready to go on?
Nice Hobbitses.
Trust Sméagol now?
Stop!
Shivery light.
Nasty.
Look!
Wraiths.
Wraiths on wings!
The precious is calling them!
Gollum, wait, Mr. Frodo can't keep up!
Slow down, I tell you.
No time, no time.
The precious is heavy, yes.
Very heavy, Sméagol knows.
If it's too heavy for nice Master...
...little Sméagol will carry it.
Sméagol doesn't mind.
Give it to Sméagol.
Do not say that again.
Do not think it.
Before you touched the precious again,
Sméagol...
...I would put it on and have you leap off a cliff, or into a fire...
...and you would do it, Sméagol.
Nice, Master.
Nice, Master.
Gollum!
Sméagol promised.
Yes, we promised to save our precious...
...never to let him have it, but it's...
...going to him, my precious is nearer every step.
I can't help it.
Sméagol promised to help nice Hobbit.
He took cruel rope off our leg.
He speaks nicely to me.
He's a Baggins, my precious.
A Baggins stoled it.
We hates Bagginses.
Must have the precious. Must have it.
We wants it.
But there's two of them.
Yes.
We needs help, precious.
She might help, yes.
She might help us...
...but Sméagol promised nice Hobbit.
Nice Hobbit.
Hey, you...
...what are you pawing at him for?
Where've you been anyway, sneaking off and sneaking back?
"Sneaking"?
Hobbit's always so polite, yes.
Tired, thirsty Sméagol, he finds a secret way through the mountain...
...a tunnel with no Orcses anywhere, and they say "sneak."
"Sneak"?
Well, you startled me. I'm sorry.
Hello, Sméagol.
- Where have you been?
- Sneaking!
I like this place.
There is good rock here.
This country has tough bones.
Up on the ridge! They're coming!
There they are!
Fire of Isengard!
We're breached. Retreat to the caves.
The caves!
Theoden King.
I will not end here...
...taken like an old badger in a trap.
When dawn comes...
...I will bid men sound Helm's horn...
...and I will ride forth.
Will you ride with me then, son of Arathorn?
At least, we may make such an end...
...as will be worth a song.
I will ride with you.
We're there, Sam.
Another day, maybe two.
When light comes tomorrow, the mountains will be near.
Well, it's a good thing, Mr. Frodo, because we're running awful low on food.
I reckon we've got enough left to see us to this Mount Doom.
After that...
...I don't know.
Samwise Gamgee.
My dearest Hobbit, friend of friends...
..."after that," if the Ring goes into the fire, and we are at hand?
"After that," dear Sam.
I wouldn't worry.
Just to get there.
Just to get there.
The Ring is so heavy now, Sam.
We must go.
Mustn't rest here, silly Hobbits.
Orcs find us. Ringwraiths find us.
Must go on to safe, secret place.
Sméagol's secret way!
The straight stair...
...and the winding stair. Up, up...
...through black, sharp mountains.
Follow good Sméagol.
Straight stair, winding stair...
...what comes after that?
We shall see, yes...
...we shall see.
Gandalf!
The forces of darkness were driven
forever from the face of Middle-earth...
... by the valiant friends of Frodo.
As their gallant battle ended...
... so too ends the first great tale of...
...The Lord of the Rings.
Legend has it, in the mystic land of Prydain, there was once a king so cruel and so evil... that even the gods feared him.
Since no prison could hold him, he was thrown alive into a crucible of molten iron.
There, his demonic spirit was captured... in the form of a great Black Cauldron.
For uncounted centuries, the Black Cauldron lay hidden, waiting, while evil men searched for it, knowing whoever possessed it would have the power... to resurrect an army of deathless warriors... and, with them, rule the world.
There's something wrong.
I can feel it in my bones.
The Fairfolk know it too.
You don’t see any of them around.
The Horned King, that black hearted devil.
What's he waiting for?
Yes, yes, cat.
I know you want your breakfast, but, just now, thinking is more important.
Taran, the pot is boiling over!
Oh, Dallben. I was just thinking.
What if the war's over, and I never had a chance to fight?
Hmm, and a good thing too.
War isn’t a game.
People get hurt.
But I'm not afraid.
Ouch!
Yes, there you are.
If the Horned King ever returns, you'll have a great deal more to worry about... than a burned finger.
No, no, no, cat. That is not for you.
It's for Hen Wen.
Hen Wen, Hen Wen.
It's always Hen Wen!
And one day, my boy, you may learn why.
Now, no more dreaming.
You have chores to do.
Yes, sir.
He's so anxious... and so blind to the dangers ahead.
Look, cat. You're in luck.
Just enough left for you.
Hmm.
Dallben doesn't understand.
I'm not a little boy anymore.
I should be doing heroic deeds for Prydain, not waiting hand and foot on a spoiled--
Hey!
Oh, all right, Hen.
I didn't mean it.
You'd better eat it.
Dallben made it especially for you.
Is this to be my life?
Pampering a pig?
I'm a warrior nota pig keeper.
Dallben thinks I'd be afraid, but I wouldn't.
All I need is a chance, and I could be a famous warrior.
Look at me, Hen!
I can do it! Ha!
Even you're afraid.
Do you challenge me? Run, you cowards.
There you are.
His Majesty, the Horned King.
So we meet at last.
Ha!
Even the Horned King shakes with fear.
See, Hen? Everybody runs from the famous Taran of Caer Dallben!
Prydain's finest warrior... draws his last... breath.
Dallben.
Hmm, not quite the blade for a hero.
I was--
It's just that we were--
Hen Wen got dirty.
Oh, I see.
Another dream, Aran?
But, Dallben, won't I ever be anything but an assistant pig keeper?
She's a special pig, Taran.
Now, give her a nice bath.
Well, Hen, it looks as though...
I'll still be an assistant pig keeper when I'm as old as Dallben.
You like that, don’t you?
Now for the part you like best.
Hey, come on, Hen.
I haven’t finished scrubbing your ba--
- Hen, what’s the matter?
Calm down, Hen.
Stop it, please! What's the matter?
- Hen Wen--
-Taran, what's going on?
I-I don't know.
There's something wrong with Hen Wen.
What? Quickly, lad.
Bring her inside.
- What's that for?
- Put Hen Wen down.
I never use her powers unless I have to, but now I must.
- ''Powers''?
-Taran, what you are about to see, you must never reveal to anyone.
Hen Wen, from you,
I do beseech... knowledge that lies beyond my reach, troubled thoughts beyond your heart.
Pray you now those thoughts impart.
The Horned King.
Shh-shh-shh. Don't interfere.
He is searching.
The Black Cauldron!
-So that's it.
- ''The Black Cauldron''?
An awesome weapon, Taran.
It's been hidden for centuries, but if the Horned King should find it... and unleash its power, nothing could stand against him.
That's Hen Wen.
He knows.
Stop! Enough!
You must leave here at once.
Take Hen Wen to the hidden cottage... at the edge of the forbidden forest.
Hide there and never bring her out until I come for you.
''Hide''? But why?
Only I knew the secret of Hen Wen's power, but now the Horned King has discovered it.
We must make sure he never uses it to find the Black Cauldron.
I'm not afraid of the Horned King.
Then you are a very foolish lad.
Untried courage is no match for his evil.
Just remember that.
Now, off you go, my boy, and take care of yourself.
Good-bye, Dallben.
I won't fail you.
So much, so soon... to rest on his young shoulders.
Oh, yes.
Yes, my soldiers.
Soon the Black Cauldron will be mine.
Its evil power will course through my veins, and I shall make you...
Cauldron born.
Yes. Yes. Oh, yes.
Then you will worship me!
Me.
Oh, my soldiers.
How long
I have thirsted... to be a god... among mortal men.
Gosh, Hen Wen.
I never knew... you could create visions and things like that.
I thought you were just an ordinary pig.
I had no idea you were so... special.
Dallben's going to be glad that he put his trust in me.
Just you wait and see.
Now, don't go wandering about.
And don’t you worry.
Keep close to me, and no one will do you any harm.
Not while I'm around.
- I won't let the Horned King get close to you, Hen.
I'll protect you.
Taran of Caer Dallben, the greatest warrior in all Prydain, a true hero!
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you all.
But without the help of my pig,
Hen Wen, here, I--
Hen Wen, where are you?
Hen Wen?
Oh, no!
Hen?
Hen Wen!
Is that you, Hen?
Look what I've got.
Come on out. Here's a lovely--
Ooh, great prince. Give poor, starving
Gorge munchings and crunchings.
Nice apple.
Good prince. Good apple.
Oh, boy, what a juicy apple.
Hey. No, you don't!
I didn't give you that apple.
You took it. Ow!
Hey, hold on, you hairy, little thief.
Come back with my apple!
If you don't give it back, you'll be sorry. I mean it.
I'm warning you.
Give it back.
Come on. The apple--
Where is it?
Uh-uh. Gorge not know where the ap-- Uh-oh.
Give it back.
I warn you.
Come on.
-Aha.
-Come on, the apple. Let's have it.
You horrible, greedy thing.
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Oh, poor, miserable Gorge deserves... fierce smackings and whackings on his poor, tender head.
Always left with no munchings and crunchings.
Forgive poor Gorge.
Oh, stop that snivelling.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Now, look here.
Have you seen my pig?
Piggy?
Round, fat piggy?
- Big snout?
- Yes, yes.
-Curly tail?
-That's her. That's Hen Wen!
Uh-uh. Nope.
Gorge not see piggy. Nope.
Oh, never mind.
No telling where
Hen Wen is by now.
Ooh, master, master.
Now Gorge remembers! Yes, yes!
Clever, sharp-eyed Gorge saw the piggy run.
Yes, right through the forest!
Mm-hmm. I saw it! I saw it!
Come!
Gorge will find the lost piggy.
Then we'll be friends forever.
Munchings and crunchings in here somewhere.
It's Hen Wen! She's in trouble!
Good-bye.
Hen Wen!
Hen!
Hen Wen!
Hen Wen, look out!
Look out!
Come on! Hurry, Hen!
No! Don't! Hen, hurry!
Don't! No!
No! No!
No! Come back!
Please!
No! No! Come back!
Hen Wen.
I must get her out of there.
Oh, no, great lord.
Not go in there.
Forget the piggy.
-What are you doing here?
-Gorge come back to be your friend.
''Friend''?
You're no friend!
Why, you ran away when I--
Oh, never mind.
I promised Dallben
I would keep Hen safe.
I have to go.
Well, uh, are you coming?
Me? Go in there?
Oh, no, no, no.
It's a terrible place.
Justas I thought.
You're no friend.
You're just a miserable coward.
Here. This is all you wanted.
If great lord go into evil castle, poor Gorge will never see his friend again.
Nope. Never.
Shut up, you thick-skulled dolt.
Always barking at nothing.
-All right, might as well make our rounds.
Here's to everybody!
More wine and meat for my men!
And more women.
Quiet. I'm trying to sleep.
How about a kiss, princess?
Gad, you’re a lovely one!
-Come on!
- Here.
Keep your hands off, you little creeper.
Going somewhere,
Creeper?
Kiss me, love, and I'll die with a smile on my face.
Welcome, Your Majesty.
We're just celebrating our success.
Oh, I mean your success.
We've made no mistakes, this time.
Bring in the prisoner!
Oh, no.
There, sire.
This is the pig that creates visions.
All right, pig, show His Majesty... where the Black Cauldron can be found!
Go on!
Show it!
Stubborn little thing, isn’t she?
Yes, sire. You're quite right.
I'll take care of it at once.
The Black Cauldron.
Where is it?
Show us, swine!
I warn you.
The King's patience is short.
No!
Get him! The sneaking, no-good--
Get back, or I'll--
Oh.
Release him.
What?
Well, here.
Hen Wen.
Oh, Hen Wen.
There, there.
I presume, my boy, you are the keeper of this oracular pig.
Yes, sir.
Then instruct her to show me... the whereabouts... of the Black Cauldron.
Oh, sir, I-I-I can't.
I promised.
Very well.
In that case, the pig is no use to me.
What are you going to do?
No! You can't!
Don't!
No! Stop!
I'll make her tell you.
That's better.
Now, get on with the vision, pig.
Hen Wen, from you,
I do beseech... knowledge that lies beyond my reach.
Look! Look, sire!
It's working!
The Black Cauldron.
So it does exist.
Go on.
Yes, yes.
Where is it?
Show me.
Show me.
Come on, Hen!
After them!
Get them! After them!
Gotcha, pig boy!
The moat.
It's our only chance.
Come on, Hen.
Swim, Hen! Swim!
I'm coming!
Gotcha, pig boy!
I caught him, Your Majesty!
I caught the boy.
But you let the pig go, didn’t you?
It wasn't my fault.
Throw the boy into the dungeon!
You must make sure he never uses Hen Wen... to find the Black Cauldron.
I won't fail you, Dallben.
Look at me, Hen!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I can do it. I can do it.
Hmm, I thought
I heard a noise in here.
Oh! Was that you?
-Yeah. Yes.
- You're being held a prisoner, aren’t you?
-Yes.
-I'm being held against my will too.
It lights up.
Of course.
It's magic.
Oh, I hate this place.
I do hope there aren’t any rats in here.
Not that I really mind them, you know, but they do jump out atone so.
I'm Princess Eilonwy.
Are you a lord or a warrior?
No.
I'm an assistant pig keeper.
Oh,what a pity.
I was so hoping for someone who could help me escape.
Oh, well, if you want to come with me, you may.
-Can I?
-Yes. I said you could.
Oh,that wicked, wicked king.
You know he stole me. He thought my bauble could tell him... where some old cauldron was.
That's what he wanted my pig for.
Oh, yes. Your pig.
But my pig can tell the future.
Ooh, how interesting.
Well, you’d better stay close to me, or you’ll get lost.
-Your bauble.
- It's always chasing those rats.
A burial chamber.
This could be the tomb of the great king who built this castle... before the Horned King took it over.
Are you all right?
Well, come on, then.
Help me look around.
He must have been a great warrior.
A sword.
This will please him.
It's a good lot this time.
Hurry! In with it!
Finally, he'll reward me for this.
Don't stop, you weakling!
Put some muscle into it.
Let's get out of here before they come back.
Where did you get that sword?
- Back there.
-You mean--
Well, he's not going to use it.
You're making a horrendous mistake. I'm not a spy.
I'm a bard.
I-I-I sing.
I-I-I entertain. I-I--
Careful, sir.
These are the hands of an artist.
This will hold you.
Look, you seem an intelligent sort of chap to me. Eh?
I assure you, I had no idea who owned this castle.
I just happened to be passing.
He's nice, isn't he?
What's his name?
Down, boy! Down!
Come on.
You don't realize who I am.
I shall sing of your dastardly deed.
I'm Fflewddur Fflam, minstrel of minstrels!
Balladeer to the grandest courts in all the land!
And I--
Well, have you forgotten?
I have sung in some of the finest courts.
I'm only waiting for an invitation.
Oh, shush.
Why do you have to judge every word I say?
Who's that?
Help!
Oh, hello. We'll have you untied in a moment.
I'm Princess Eilonwy... and you're in bad trouble, aren’t you?
''Trouble''?
Don’t you know where you are?
Haven’t you seen him?
Pig boy has escaped.
Look in there.
- We've been discovered.
-That's you?
Oh, great beelin.
Run! Run!
Make haste!
''Make haste''?
I must save myself.
I think he went through the passage!
All right.
Let's try down here.
Princess?
Princess Eilonwy?
Pig boy!
You little scut!
Hey.
No, no, no.
Are you all right?
-Oh, good. You're safe.
-Why, of course. I--
-Come on. I'm going to get you out of here.
- There they are!
-Quick! Up here.
Taran, the sword.
Help! Murder!
Don't!
Keep going, Princess.
There he is! There he is!
Over there!
Stop him!
- Taran!
- There they are!
-Come on! Get them!
-Oh, no! Taran!
We've got you now, pig boy!
Taran, do something!
Use the sword!
Make way! Make way!
Stand aside. I command you!
Get out from under my feet!
Let me go, you brute!
Run, Princess! Run!
Stay up!
Please, stay up!
Why didn’t you tell me you had a magic sword?
I'll say it wasn't my fault.
That's it.
That's it. I always get blamed for these things.
I'll just tell him, and if he gets mad...
I’ll just straighten him out.
That's it. I'm not going to be kicked around for this.
S-Sire?
You bring news of the pig?
No, not exactly, sire.
Oh, it's the pig keeper.
He's-- Ooh, he's--
He's... escaped.
Oh. Oh. Oh, sire!
Allow me.
Isn't that enough?
Good.
He'll find his pig.
Send the gwythaints to follow that boy.
Oh, yes, sire!
Oh, yes!
By all means, sire!
* The world will applaud me *
* Its praise will reward me *
* And I, Fflewddur Fflam will find fame **
They're almost finished, Fflewddur.
Hmm, it's not too good, but it will hold for awhile.
Yes, I shall sing of your deed.
It would be better to sing of our heroic escape.
Weren’t you a bit frightened,
Fflewddur?
A Fflam frightened?
The word is not in my vocabulary.
But in this case, well-chosen, my dear.
- I wasn’t afraid.
-Ouch! Not afraid?
Why, we were running for our lives.
Well, I got us out of the castle, didn't I?
You? I'd say it was the sword's magic.
But it takes a great warrior to handle a sword like this.
But still, it is a magic sword.
Ha! What does a girl know about swords anyway?
''Girl''? Girl?
If it weren't for this girl, you would still be in the Horned King's dungeon.
Here now,
Princess Eilonwy, Taran.
At least I don't keep talking about it forever.
Oh, you're so, so boring!
Princess Eilonwy--
How dare you take his side!
I really didn't--
I didn’t mean to interfere, you know.
Silly girl.
Even if she is a princess.
But we’re going to have to, to--
Dear, oh, dear.
Hello.
Hello.
Fflewddur is right, you know.
We are going to have to work together.
And we'll find your pig.
I'm sure it's important.
Thank you for getting me out of the dungeon.
Oh, but we couldn't have done it without you.
Well, at least we’re all safe.
- Great beelin!
- Fflewddur!
Help! Murder!
Hurry!
- Gurgi's lucky day.
-Get this thing off me.
-Wow.
-Yes, keep it! It's a gift!
-Want this. Gorge want this.
-Go ahead.
I'm sure you've murdered for less.
Want. Want.
Gorge want!
Gorge.
Master? Oh, old man fell down.
Get up. Get up.
Well, really.
Who is your pungent, little friend?
He's no friend of mine.
He's just a coward and a thief.
Too big anyway.
You're charming.
And pungent too.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Yes, yes. That's it.
Toddle off. Toddle off.
Gorge go!
Tracks? Tracks!
Gorge remember.
Saw piggy's tracks.
-You did?
-Today!
-Today? Wait a minute.
- He'll try anything.
Oh, you’re both horrid.
He just might know.
- Pretty lady come too?
-Well, I--
-Yes, yes, yes!
Follow Gorge! Follow Gorge!
You better be telling the truth.
Gorge not lie, not this time.
See, master?
Piggy's footsteps.
No lie.
Oh, good.
They look fresh.
Oh, master. Master!
Gorge, hold on!
Oh, no! Taran!
-Give me your hand!
-We're doomed.
How did they get in here?
Old Doli's whirlpool broke again.
I betthey wake up soon.
We better tell King Eidellig.
No, silly. You know we’re not supposed to be up here.
Uh-oh. We're all going to be in trouble.
- Not me.
- Me either.
Uh-oh.
Oh, yes. I see you fixed that.
Yep. When...
I get this... last peg in here,
I'll be finished.
Good. Hmm.
Yes. That should work.
It's perfect.
Grab that pole!
Uh, I got it.
Oh, aren’t you all darling?
Uh, hello.
I'm King Eidellig of the Fairfolk.
How the blazes did they--
I thought I told you to fix the whirlpool.
I fixed it. I did fix it!
It was perfect!
Evidently, not completely perfect.
It's supposed to keep them out.
- Uh, can I be of any service?
-Is everything that happens around here my fault?
-Are you on a friendly visit?
-And I suppose it's my fault the pig's here too!
- Hen Wen?
-Oh, she's your pig?
Oh, good.
One less thing for old Doli to worry about.
- Uh, Doli.
- What now?
Would you hurry and fetch the pig?
Hey, you kids.
What are you doing?
Oh, Mr. Doli, I just want to see the pretty lady.
Well, now, you watch yourselves.
Hear?
I can't believe my eyes,
Your Majesty.
Watch it. Watch it!
Oh, Hen!
Thank goodness you're--
Tell me. Is the burning and killing still going on up there?
You refer to that-that-that-that... joke on humanity, the Horned King.
Will no one ever stand up to him?
We've seen him, and if he finds the Cauldron, he'll kill us all.
Oh, no, no.
He'll never find it.
No, no.
It's safely hid in Morva.
- ''Morva''?
-Well, at least I think it is.
Oh, Doli, is it?
- Really?
Is that one of my new jobs, remembering where the Cauldron was last seen?
Gee!
Oh, he'll know right where it is.
You'll see.
If we could get to the Cauldron first and destroy it--
-Oh, this isn't right, Taran.
- But don’t you see?
If we destroy the Cauldron, it will stop the Horned King.
Please, come with me.
Wait, I never thought--
Morva.
-That's a hard place to get to.
-Yep.
-Why, you can take them.
-What?
Do you mean we're trusting our lives to-to-to him?
-And what is wrong with me?
- Oh, nothing.
Splendid choice.
Shall we, then?
Wait! Hen Wen!
Oh, don’t worry.
We'll get her home safely.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Be good, Hen.
Well, if it’s the Marshes of Morva you wanted, here you are.
Ooh!
Such a dreary place.
Let's see what it looks like from up here.
I think we're lost.
Are you sure this is the right place, Doli?
Yes, I'm sure!
Well, if you ask me--
- Fflewddur! Doli!
-Are you all right?
Hey, look out, you big, clumsy oaf!
Look where you--
Uh-oh.
Welcome to Morva.
Well, s-someone must live here.
Gorge not like this place.
Uh-uh. No.
It seems empty.
Maybe we should have a look.
If I can just get this door open.
How will we ever find the Black Cauldron in a place like this?
It must be here somewhere.
They're only frogs, Eilonwy.
Those were people.
You mean they were turned into frogs?
Ooh, master, come quickly.
Gorge found the wicked Cauldron.
Quick, quick, quick!
Follow Gorge!
- Behold, master.
-The whole room is full of cauldrons.
I don't understand.
Why would,why would anyone want so many--
Thieves! Thieves!
Someone stole all our frogs!
You evil, nasty people.
You shall all be turned into frogs and eaten!
Huh?
Nice and tender.
Stop that, you, you--
Oh. So nice to meet you, ladies.
-Good-bye.
- Wait.
My, aren’t you the handsome one?
Wh-Who? M-M-Me?
Oh, honestly, now, don’t you find me irresistible?
Yes. Well, of course, most attractive.
Shush! Stop that.
You don’t mind if I... pluck your harp, do you, handsome?
Bah! Enough of that lovesick nonsense.
Great beelin'!
Quick!
We're going to have toad stew.
You're not gonna eat this one.
Come here, love.
-Can anyone here perform marriages?
- Marriages?
You love struck witch!
Where is he?
Where'd he go?
Yoo-hoo!
Where are you?
Don't go.
Now look what you’ve done.
- He's gone! I'll never forgive you for this, Orgoch.
Never!
Whoo! There you are!
Enough! We've come for the Black Cauldron.
Did you hear that, sisters?
Why, nobody's asked for the Black Cauldron in over 2,000 years.
It's a trick. We're not going to let them have it, are we?
Don’t worry.
Leave it to me.
Perhaps I might interest you in something else: a kettle, a cook pot, a skillet, a teapot, a bucket, a jar, a platter?
See anything you like?
I don't believe it.
I've never seen a sword like that.
I've got to have that sword.
Listen carefully. We'll trade the Cauldron for the sword.
But what can they do with the Cauldron, Orddu?
Nothing! That's the point.
Don’t you see?
We'll end up with both the sword and the Cauldron.
It's decided then.
You shall have the Black Cauldron.
You mean... you'll give it to us?
That's not what I said.
You weren't listening.
We never give anything away.
What we do is bargain,
-trade.
-Well, you’ll not have my sword!
May I ask you ladies to perhaps consider this magnificent harp?
A harp?
Oh, when we want music, we send for the birds.
What would we do with a simple harp?
Wait! Gorge will trade his crunchings and munchings.
-Who would want--
-Hold it, sister. Not so fast.
All right.
I know what you want.
Yes?
No, Taran! No!
It's our only chance.
Here is my sword.
Take it.
Is it your own choice, duckling?
Remember:
With this sword, you could be the greatest of warriors.
Yes. I offer my dearest possession... in exchange for the Black Cauldron.
Agreed. We have made a bargain.
Look out!
Help!
Taran, watch out!
Great beelin'!
Duck!
Look!
The Black Cauldron.
It's ours!
I say, what funny little ducklings.
Don’t they know the Black
Cauldron is indestructible?
Now, listen carefully.
The Black Cauldron can never be destroyed.
Only its evil powers can be stopped.
Then there is a way.
But how?
A living being must climb into it... of his own free will.
Gorge is bold and brave.
He will climb into the evil Cauldron.
However, the poor duckling will never climb out alive.
Yikes!
N-N-Now, look here, madam.
Don't forget we had an agreement.
Yes. You said we could have the Cauldron.
Of course we said you could have the Cauldron.
It's not our fault you can't do anything with it.
Good-bye, goslings.
Remember, we always keep a bargain.
Whata bunch of blundering misfits!
Things just never work out when you're dealin' with people!
You can go back to feeding pigs!
I've had it!
Good-bye!
Doli's right.
It's-It's my fault.
I let you down.
Without my sword,
I'm nothing... just an assistant pig keeper.
Look, you are somebody.
You must believe in yourself.
- I believe in you.
- Y-You do?
And I think that you’re--
Uh... I mean--
- That is--
- Yes, Taran?
I mean, uh--
What I mean is
I'm grateful to all of you.
You've been true friends.
Now it's up to me--
Look!
Uh-oh. Trouble. Good-bye.
Quick! We can't let them find us.
Pig boy!
Fight where you are, pig boy.
Gotcha.
Get a move on!
Careful, now.
You! Pile them up over there!
And get that cart out of here!
Oh, oh! I'm sorry.
I've ignored you.
You did come for the Black Cauldron, didn’t you?
Good. Then climb in!
It will only cost you your life.
Oh.
Oh!
E-Everything is-is ready, sire.
My, such a brave and handsome group: a pig boy, a scullery maid... and a broken-down minstrel.
Perhaps it may interest you to see what fate has in store for you.
Now I call on my army of the dead, the Cauldron born.
Arise, my messengers of death.
Our time has arrived.
Oh, it's horrible.
My beloved warriors have come to life.
All the dead of centuries past.
Never has anyone created an army like this.
Go forth, my deathless warriors!
Destroy all in your path!
Come, sire. We can get a better view from above.
Oh, Taran.
I'm afraid it'll soon be over for us.
I-I hadn't planned it to end like this, Eilonwy.
Oh, I wish I'd stayed a toad.
Only moments away from victory.
My greatest triumph.
We did it, sire!
We did it!
I-I-I mean, I mean you.
Yes, of course, you did it, sire.
Y-Y-Yikes!
Gorge? Gorge?
Is that you?
- Master!
-Gorge... what are you doing here?
Gorge is sorry he always runs away when there's trouble.
He will untie everybody.
Then we will leave this evil place.
Yeah, but, uh, get on with it.
Good boy, Gorge! Eilonwy, you and Fflewddur go with Gorge.
I must stop the Cauldron.
Oh, but, Taran, that's impossible.
Why, you’d be--
- Taran!
- I'm sorry, Eilonwy.
Please, Taran.
No! You can't!
My mind is made up.
Wait, master!
Gorge not let you jump into Cauldron.
-Gorge, get out of my way!
-Whoa!
Whoa!
Please, master.
Not go into evil Cauldron.
If I don’t, we’re all lost.
Out of my way!
No, Gorge not let his friend die.
Taran has many friends.
Gorge has no friends.
Gorge, no!
Don't jump! Wait!
No! No!
Oh, no.
Sire?
Sire, look.
Something's wrong.
What is it, sire?
They're-They're dying!
It can’t be.
This had better not be your fault.
Perhaps it needs another body, sire.
Yes. Yours!
Get Eilonwy out of here.
Hurry!
- But, Taran, I-- Please, I--
-Go on! Go with Fflewddur.
M-Maybe there's still a chance for Gorge.
No, sire! Please!
Get up!
Come alive!
Maybe they're only resting, sire.
Do something!
My life is at stake!
Get up, you fools! Kill!
Look! Sire, look!
It's the pig boy.
It's his fault. Yes.
He's the cause of it!
You've interfered for the last time.
Go for his throat, sire.
Now, pig keeper, you shall die.
No! Don't!
What? What's this?
No, you’ll not escape.
You shall satisfy the Cauldron's hunger.
Oh, no.
No!
You'll not have me!
My power cannot die!
Curse you!
No! No!
Oh, no.
How-How-How horrible.
Poor sire.
He-He's gone.
He's gone.
He's gone!
He's gone!
Fflewddur! Eilonwy!
Over here! Hurry!
Thank goodness you're safe.
Come on, Fflewddur.
Hurry!
Run for your lives!
Come on. Jump.
Taran, look!
Quick. Get in.
Let's go.
Here. Push off, Fflewddur.
Eh? Uh-oh.
Uh, trouble.
Oh, we can't get through.
I-I'll try to open the gate.
Taran, be careful, please.
Hurry! Move on through.
Come on, Fflewddur.
Hurry!
Oh, good work, lad.
Let me give you--
Look out!
Look.
Gorge.
Gorge?
Why is the duckling so sad?
Yes. He's got what he wanted, and he's still not satisfied.
Just what do you think you're up to, ladies?
Oh, we have business with your little hero.
Hero? Gorge was the hero.
The only thing that mattered to you was the Cauldron, but now it's no use to you.
-So we'll just take it and be on our way.
Stay your hand, ladies.
We never give anything away.
We bargain. We trade. Remember?
Did-Did these old ears hear the word ''bargain''? Hmm?
Yes, madam, those old ears heard right.
Ohh!
I adore forceful men.
Oh, pull yourself together, madam.
Now, come on, out with it.
What is your offer?
- No, not my--
-Then I'll do it.
A magnificent sword for a warrior.
I'm nota warrior.
I'm a pig boy.
What would I do with a sword?
Absolutely nothing.
-But I would trade...
- Yes? the Cauldron for Gorge.
- Dear!
- It's not possible.
Justas I thought, ladies.
You've got no real power!
Admit it! Admit it!
We have made a bargain.
Oh, Taran.
Munchings and crunchings in here somewhere.
Gorge!
You're alive!
He's alive.
Great beelin', He is alive.
Oh, Fflewddur, Fflewddur.
He's alive!
I'm alive!
Gurgi's alive!
Look, look, look!
Touch me!
Gurgi, you clever little thing.
Come on, Gorge.
Let's go home.
Gurgi's happy day!
Come on.
Great beelin'.
Hmm.
You did well, my boy.
Yep.
Good morning, good morning!
That was
"A-Billion-and-One Strings," playing one of your favorite tunes.
At the top of the news this morning... there's monkey business in Utah.
A band of renegade chimpanzees... have kidnapped Pulitzer prize-winning poet Lester Charles.
What's the big idea?
I'm attempting to sleep!!
I doing a broadcasting.
Do you mind?
Whoa, not in the face!
Uh, the chimps are protesting...
I've got a mind to reset your alarm... permanently!
Sorry, folks.
We're experiencing technical difficulty... but it's nothing we can't handle!!
This just in.
Domestic violence erupts in peaceful cottage!
We'll keep you post...
Whew!
Can't hear your own thoughts with all the racket.
Holy mother of Edison!
What were you thinking?
You might have broken my bulb!
I'm thinking you think too much.
We need wake-up music.
So when it's raining
Have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain you know
It's raining violets
Blah!
Va-rooooom!
I'll track you to the end of this carpet.
Come here.
I'm going to get you.
Wait till I fix your speaker!!
Rusetti picks it up and throws.
Cepeda tags, he heads for second.
Wait till I get my plugs on you!
[Radio]
The crowd goes wild.
Can you believe those
Brooklyn Dodgers!!
[Lamp]
I've got you.
I've got you now.
Ha, ha, ha.
Come here.
You dare to cross foils... with the greatest Saxon swordsman in the land?
[Radio]
Have you any inkling who you're dealing with?
[Lamp]
Precisely. A total idiot.
[Radio]
If your saber wags as loosely as your tongue... you'll be run through in an instant.
Defend yourself,
Sir Lampy of Locksley.
- A blow for Richard!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Marian!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Mario, the garbage man.
- Ouch!
And for the boys at the delicatessen.
And here's one for the guys on 5th Street.
No!
Whoa! Ugh!
What's going on?
Who turned out the lights?
Good morning.
Good morning,
Toaster.
- Hey, slots.
- Salutations!
Umph!
- Thanks.
- What's on our lineup today?
What are our instructions?
What are we gonna do today?
The same thing we've done for the last 2,000 days.
Chores!
- Chores?
- It'll be fun.
I'm always up for fun!
Listen, a broadcast from Ebbets Field!
It's the top of the ninth...
I don't understand how chores could be fun.
Not supposed to be fun.
It's work!
I don't like to work without the Master.
Well, okay.
If you don't want to work, why don't we play a game?
- What sort of game?
- What are the rules?
There's only one rule.
You can't stop till the house is clean.
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
[Whispering]
Gotcha, pal.
Leave it to me.
Hang on to your hats, you devil dogs... because the master bebop blaster... is gonna give you a soul injection.

Hey, shhh. Quiet!
It's the blanket!
A car.
- A car?
- A car!
All right, fellows, steady.
A little to the left.
Careful.
- I'm gonna fall.
- Keep climbing.
You, get that light out of my eyes!
All right, a little to the left.
To the right!
There you go.
A little to the middle.
I don't know which direction the middle is in.
- Can you see?
- Is it him?
Any news?
I'm dying down here.
Is it the Master?
It's him.
He's back!
It's the Master!
Blanky!
Master!
Blanky!
[Blanky Crying]
Was it him?
I'm just curious.
I hate being left in the dark.
I guess we can assume that it wasn't him.
Let's get back to work.
Sorry for that interruption, folks.
We return to our regularly scheduled program... at this time.
Whaa-haa-haa.
Cry, weep, wail and sob.
It's disgusting.
Every time!!
Every single...
Give me that stupid picture.
No, no!
- I'll put it away.
- In the garbage!
- You can't!
- Wimp!
- Let go!
- He's not coming back anyway.
He might.
Fact is, there's not enough facts.
Fight breaks out in peaceful mountain cottage... shocking world and bringing
Geneva talks to a halt!
- Let me have it.
- You can't.
Oh, no.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you laughing at?
Absolutely nothing, nothing at all.
I think he was laughing at us.
You know something?
You're a bright little lamp.
Oh, thanks.
Hey.
You guys have an attachment for that kid, don't you?
Yes, he was our master.
That's real nice.
Any day he might come romping back... just come whistling back through that door... and everything will be the same... real peachy keen.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a possibility.
Well, at least we try to be optimistic.
Optimistic?
Somebody untie the knot in this guy's cord.
Why don't you just shut off?
I'm real scared, Kirby.
Are you going to suck me to death?
- Hmph!
- What is it with you?
You act like you just came off the assembly line.
Get this through your chrome.
We've been dumped, abandoned.
- But he loved us.
- That's right.
So what?
He has a family.
They move, he moves.
It's a package deal.
But...
He's not coming back, pure and simple.
Did you talk to him?
They could drive up any second.
You really think so?
I'm not talking to you.
You have a combined wattage of five, maybe less.
It's been years.
It's scrap metal time.
Do what you like.
We're not gonna give up hope.
That's real touching.
You're gonna get me bawling like a baby any time now.
I think you're jealous.
Sure, I'm jealous of a bunch of dimwits.
- Dim?
- Yeah!
The Master never played with you.
Because you're stuck in the wall!
So, it's back to that stupid static again.
You think I don't know what's going on in here?
I know what goes on in this cottage.
It's a conspiracy... and every one of you low-watts is in on it.
Just because you move around... you think you're better than I am.
I was designed to stick in a wall!
I like being stuck in this stupid wall!
I can't help it... if the kid was too short to reach my dials!
We didn't mean it, really.
It's my function!!
Don't.
Wait, wait!
- He's gonna blow!
- Yank the cord!
The fuse!
Poor Air Conditioner.
I didn't know he'd take it so hard.
He was a jerk anyway.
Hey, what's that?
What is it?
A car.
Not another word about cars.
You said it.
Sounds close.
Just don't even start.
Sounds real close.
[Car Door Closing]
[Hammering]
[Humming "Taps"]
Wah, hah, hah!
[Humming]
Stop it!
We're going out to find him.
- What?
- What do you mean?
Exactly what I said.
We're gonna go out and find the Master.
To the city?
No matter what!
How would you propose we're gonna do that, exactly?
I don't know.
Come off it.
Be serious.
I am serious.
You're insane.
If only we were wiener dogs, our problems would be solved.
What?
Maybe it was a basset hound.
You're all insane!
It was a news flash
I picked up about a dog.
In an amazing show of loyalty and courage... a terrier named Grover traveled hundreds of miles... to be reunited with his owner.
The poor critter was accidentally left behind... on a fishing trip three weeks ago.
He had to find his way across rugged mountains... and scorching deserts in order to get home.
Little Grover turned out to be one spunky pup.
If a dog can do it, we can do it!
But a dog has legs.
Ah, don't be a wet blanket.
- Legs would help.
- Brains wouldn't hurt either.
- Lay off.
- Pipe down, carpet breath.
I'm going, with or without you.
I say we stay.
We'll have a new master when someone buys the cottage.
But I don't want a new master.
I want our master.
Well... what about the rest of you?
You boys are gonna need a leader.
Alone, you wouldn't last for 5 minutes out there.
I used to be a mountaineer.
Together... we can stand against the forces of nature!
Were you really a mountaineer?
Sure, ask anybody.
Ask Teddy Roosevelt.
We shot moose together on the Klondike.
You know,
I was thinking... you guys will need somebody bright along.
- Good idea.
- Listen to this.
World War II, the Normandy Invasion... and who dare but Lampy to light the way?
You know...
I thought it would be good to have somebody come along... who's really... strong.
- And loud.
- And grumpy!
And oblivious to reality.
Well?
I just know I'm going to regret this.
[Cheering]
- Yippee!
- Hot dog!
Wow, this is our last fuse.
Good thing we're getting out of here.
I've always loved travel.
The open road, the wind in my face... the flies clogging up my grille.
Yeah? How are we going to travel?
We could all pile on top of the bed... and then Kirby can push us!
No, no.
Hey, what about the Master's pogo stick?
[Crash]
That's no good.
How about we're in the refrigerator... on a skateboard and Kirby can pull?
No, no. Hey!
- Shut up.
- Shut up!
Let somebody else try for a change.
Arise, Hassan.
Arise, oh magic carpet.
We need a longer cord.
We need an alternate power source, I say.
- I guess this is it.
- Uh-huh.
- [Sigh]
- Blanket?
Huh?
Ready to go?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay, Kirby.
Hmm, shag carpet.
Look, Lampy.
From here you can see the really big lamp.
Wow!!
I wonder where his switch is?
We are pioneers.
Whoa!
[Toaster]
Can't see the road anymore.
Are we going in the right direction?
[Blanky]
I don't think so.
[Radio]
You boys need a navigator.
Navigator?
I'll tune in a radio signal from the city.
I can take you right there, lickety-split.
[Static]
[Instrumental]
North by northwest.
Watch out for low-flying aircraft.
- Ow.
- What's wrong?
He stepped on me.
- Did not.
- Did too.
Did too!
Did not!
Hey, come on.
How do you expect us to get there if you're fighting?
You mean we're not there yet?
No, not yet.
We got a long way to go.
Oh, boy, you're telling me.
Life is like a journey
On the road that's within
Head says you should stay
But your heart says to begin
So you go
But you don't want to go
Any life worth living
Isn't life just filled with ease
You just stay forgiving
Through the forests and the trees
And you'll go
Just where you want to go
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Light shines like a diamond in the city at night
When that diamond shines
You know that everything's all right
But you know
We got a way to go
Let us meet the Master
We don't want to make him wait
You just keep a-knocking he will open up the gate
To that city of light
Master is a man with a plan I can understand
Master is a man of great reflection
Master is a man who lays his hand across the land
Master is a man of our affection
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Hey, everybody.
Look!
- A clearing!
- Great.
Spread out the blanket and have a picnic.
I'm full of stickers.
My bag's full of thistles and sticks... and who knows what else!
Whose idea was it to come this way?
The lamp's.
Oh, yeah?
Who's supposed to be the big shot navigator...
Mr. Loudmouth?
Mr. Big Loudmouth.
- Yeah.
- Where are we?
Give me a second and... listen to this.
It's the top of the ninth, the bases are loaded... and Pee Wee Reese is at the plate.
There's the pitch.
He connects.
Oh, and it's a triple play.
Knock it off!
We should all settle down... and try to get some sleep.
This is my sleeping space.
Nobody crosses this line.
You better not wake us up at 6:00 as usual.
- Why are you complaining?
You didn't work today.
- Yeah.
Go find your own place to sleep, fuzz ball.
Watch it.
Are you blind?
It's a line.
Good night!
Come on,
I'm not the Master.
Go snuggle somewhere else.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Go on.
[Sigh]
Help!
Don't leave me.
Listen, listen.
What's that?
[Croaking]
Over there!
Oh, look!
Light.
I see light!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Ribbit.
[Humming]
Ribbit.
[Tap, Tap, Tap]
That's the same riff I used... when I was drumming for Cab Calloway.
Like this.
Cut that out!
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
Booga-booga.
Boodle-boodle.
Get out of here!
Hey fellas, come look at this.
Whoa!
I'm trying to see.
Look at me!!
[Chattering]
Oh.
No, no.
It's just a reflection.
I'm not a flower.
[Laughter]
Ribbit.
Come on, help me.
They're killing me.
Leave him alone!
Stop it.
Give me that.
He was chewing on the Master.
Time to go.
Bye.
[Toaster]
Are you sure this is the right direction?
[Radio]
As sure as I am honest.
[Lampy]
Then we're definitely lost.
There might be lions in there.
And tigers and bears, oh my.
He's such a baby.
Waa-waa!
What's the matter,
Kirby?
Battery's running low.
We should give it a rest.
Turn out that light.
[Bushes Rustling]
Do we have to stop here?
Only for a while.
Just long enough to lose our minds.
We'll be cannibals within a few days.
You'll be the first to go, dial face.
Hey, fellas, we can stay here.
Look.
What's the matter?
Eaten alive, the poor sap.
Wow, wow!
I thought you were a goner.
You wish.
We are gonna need some kind of shelter.
Shelter from the likes of them.
Come here and say that, chrome-dome.
- What?
- Oh, sorry.
I meant to say
"vacuous vacuum."
Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rumble.
In the blue corner, undefeated champion...
Rocko "The Radio" Ratuno.
Ding!
And there's the bell.
They're on each other like black on a bowling ball.
Look.
["Star-Spangled Banner"]
That concludes our broadcast day.
This is Lowell Winchell signing off.
Good night, America, and all the ships at sea.
Thanks.
That's all right.
So, what's this thing with you and the blanket?
What thing?
All of a sudden you're being so darn nice to him.
I was just thinking, and I got this feeling... that I should be nicer to him for a change.
And now
I feel better.
- That's weird.
- What's weird about it?
You were never this nice to him before... and now you're nice to him all the time.
I don't know.
I'm just trying to understand, figure out what it means.
It's kinda hard to describe.
It's like being next to a new loaf of bread.
Hmm, let's see.
It's like a warm, toasty feeling inside.
Like a glow.
- A glow?
- Yeah.
I think I know what you're talking about.
It's like the feeling I get when I think about the Master.
That's it.
I remember the first time my bulb burned out.
I thought,
"That's it.
"It's over.
I'm burned out.
Eighty-sixed.
To the showers!!"
But then the Master put in a brand-new bulb.
And I just glowed.
That's all there is to it.
That's very interesting.
Good night, slot head.
Good night.
Blah.
Ahh.
Run.
[Wicked Laughter]
[Thunder]
Aahh. Help me!
Help me!
Toaster!
Blanky!!
- Blanky?
- Blanky!
Where are you?
- Blanky?
- Blanky!!
- Blanket!
- Can you hear me?
The battery's gone dead!
We're trapped like rats... small rats with no hair and one light.
Blanky!
- Blanket!!
- Blanky!!
Where are you, you little wimp?
Blanky!!
Lampy!
Blanky?
Where are you?
Blan...
...keey?
Come on, Blanky, speak up!
Just relax.
You've done enough.
We'll look for him.
I am feeling burned out.
Listen.
Lamp was awarded a Purple Heart... for being wounded in the line of duty.
Lamps across the nation were switched off... for a moment of silence in respect for his bravery.
Help.
- Listen.
- Help me.
Toaster, Kirby,
I'm stuck.
- I hear him.
- But I can't see him.
Maybe he's calling from blanket heaven.
He's a puffy yellow angel, with a knob nose.
He's just stuck, that's all. Look!
Help.
[Toaster]
Hang on tight.
I am.
[Radio]
Don't let the tremendous height scare you.
Hey, watch out.
Come on.
I can't see.
Get off.
Watch out below!!
That was kind of fun.
Now get off of my face!
- Thanks, Kirby.
- Great idea.
You saved me.
I knight thee
"Sir Vac."
Cut it out.
I did it so we could go.
We're wasting time.
[Thunderous Noise]
What's this?
What's...
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Kirby, no!
Get the cord out of his mouth!
Don't let him swallow it.
Switch him off.
Just shorted right out.
Cracked up, snapped, sold the farm.
- Poor chump.
- How's he look?
Better than you, actually.
Keep it up, slots.
Carpet-sweeping motions.
He should come around.
Hey, I think it's working.
Kirby, can you hear me?
Wake up.
Wake up!
- Kirby!
- You're all right.
Yeah!
Lay off.
Just lay off!
- What's the matter?
- We were worried.
You gave us a scare, pal.
There's nothing wrong with me, pal!
- Just back off!
- Don't be angry.
Keep your antennas, knobs, and wires... and rivets off my chrome!
Who needs you?
Got to drag you around all the time.
I'd be better off without you.
But...
Especially you, you little rag.
So how do we get across this thing, anyway?
Houdini did this once.
He was out of the hospital in no time.
That's encouraging.
Okay, Kirby.
Hey, we're not dead.
Yeah? Where's some wood to knock on?
Toaster, you okay?
Toaster?
Yeah, I am.
Give me some slack.
Oh.
Wha...
Agh.
Aaahhhh!
Yeowwww!
Help! Help!
Damn thee, thou cursed whale!!
From the depths of hell
I stab at thee.
- Climb on, you idiot.
- Oh, it's you.
Where's Toaster?
He sank.
Are we glad to see you!
I really thought I'd turned in my warranty.
Yeah, until baggy showed up.
I just slipped and fell in, that's all.
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Sure!
You can't fool us.
We love you.
Like Mrs. Roosevelt loved her husband.
Here's the shore.
Everybody off.
Listen to this!
This is President Roosevelt... awarding the vacuum the Medal of Honor.
Blah!
Ha, ha!
That's funny.
I'm dying.
Where are we?
I can't believe this.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
It's not your fault.
Things could be worse, you know.
- How?
- How what?
How could they be worse?
They couldn't.
I lied.
Can't you find anything?
I'm lucky my backup batteries work at all.
I hope we're not going in circles.
Come on.
Aaah!
I knew I shouldn't have let you guys drive.
Come on, pull!
Kirby!
This is great fun.
Let's make these outings a regular thing, okay?
Inflate your bag!
Help me!
Aaah!
Wow, the poor guy didn't have a chance.
Just ssss, and that's it.
Don't look now, but you're about to ssss yourself!
What? Whoa!
Blanky, let go.
Try to untie yourself.
I'm not scared.
Well, that concludes our broadcast today.
Actually, it concludes... all future broadcasting of any sort.
We'll sign off now with a suitable tune!
Mammy
Mammy, Mammy
I'm coming
Oh l...
I hope I didn't make you wait
Mammy
I'm coming
O, Lord
Ha, I thought
I heard a radio!
Whoa!
Hmmm.
Do-dilly yup-bup-bup
Upsy-daisy!
Whoop!!
There you go!!
Good boy, Quadruped.
You remembered your seat belt.
Ahh.
[Ding-Ding]
A customer!
Seems like a nice fella.
Dingy, but nice.
Heh-heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!
Mister St. Peters is quite an amusing fellow... isn't he?
Oh, you poor baby.
Your bulb is burned out.
Here, you can have one of mine.
Use it in good health... while you still can.
[Ding]
[Customer]
Hello, compadre...
I am in deep need of a blender motor.
Ha, ha!
A blender motor?
I got a whole shipment ofblender motors in last week.
[Customer]
Heaven sent you to me.
I'll have it for you in
2 shakes of a lamb's tail.
Now what did I do with that blender?
I could've sworn I left it here a second ago.
I'm getting as loopy as a polecat... without any whiskers.
There you are!
I found you.
Gotta move you guys out of the way.
[Crack]
Ha, ha!
Whoa.
Boy, are you some lucky guy!!
This was the last one left.
Heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!!
You never quite know what he's going to do.
He's so spontaneous.
W-w-well, how do we escape?
Did you hear that?
They want to know how to escape!
Heh-heh-heh!
[Spooky Organ Music]
Watch yourself
Don't fall off of the shelf
You must be the new boys in town
What's that sound
Is someone moving 'round
Sit down for a spell
You don't look so well
Wait a minute
I feel great
You just leave yourself to fate
You might as well just hang around
It's too late
We've got to operate
Just try to relax
It's a house of wax
Oh, I remember
Frankenstein
Shivers up my spine
Whoa-oh
I'm for getting out of here
No need to shout my dear
No-oh
Who will go to the cellar down below
Trouble is a-bubbling in the brew
While you're down there
Mr. Vincent Price will give you good advice
He'll know what to do
You just tell him boo
He will put the voodoo in the stew, I'm telling you
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Look at me.
Barf, barf, barf!
I'm a can opener, a lamp, and a shaver.
Oh, God,
I'm a mishmash!
This is weird
It's much worse than I feared
I'll close my eyes and make it disappear
- This is strange
- It ain't home on the range
You just tell St. Pete that you got cold feet
There goes the sun
Here comes the night
Somebody turn on the light
Somebody tell me that fate has been kind
You can't go out
You are out of your mind
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh ah-ahh
Ahhh
[Ding-Ding]
[Customer] Excuse me, the missus loved the blender motor.
Was wondering if you got some radio tubes, too.
Sure.
I got a whole shipment of radio tubes in this morning.
You gotta help me.
I'll do anything!
I can get you bread, mounds of hot cross buns.
Pull yourself together!
Now what did I do with that radio?
I could swear I left it right here... in this very, very spot.
What did it do, get up and walk away?
I really should drink more coffee.
Aha!
There you are!
Ha, ha!
I got ya!
Bo-bub-bup
Kirby, what should we do?
I don't know.
Hey!
I've got an idea!
A-hoo!!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Aaah!
See? It worked!
I told you!
I told you!
I knew!
It worked!
Jailbreak!
Jailbreak!
[Siren]
Oh, ooh.
What?
Did I catch you at a bad time?
Just wondering if you got my radio tubes.
Wow!
Yee-hoo!
Honey... are you taking enough underwear?
Mom, you bought me enough underwear to stock the whole dorm.
Do you have enough socks?
I'm not going toJupiter,
I'm going to college.
- It's just college.
- So let me worry a little bit.
I'm your mother.
[Doorbell]
That's Chris.
We're going to the cabin... and pick up the lamp and radio and stuff.
I can use them at the dorm.
Hi, Rob.
You ready?
Good-bye, Mom!
Take a sweater.
Hey, Plugsy.
- Yeah?
- Did you hear that?
He's taking some old... stuff to the dorm... instead of us.
All right, go!!
You're gonna like this cabin.
Too bad we have to sell it.
[Blanky]
How are we gonna find the Master... in this big place?
Here it is.
[Ding]
Excuse me... could you tell us how to get to...
To, uh...
2470 McBean Parkway.
[Ding]
A113.
This is it.
Go ahead.
He's not home.
We'll have to wait.
Let's wait inside and relax!
But it's locked.
Luckily, my war training included inter-appliance codes.
I will simply render the secret appliance knock... and we'll be welcomed by the native machinery.
Stand aside, my meager companion.
Hiya, pal!
It's them!!
What are we gonna do?
Should we let them in?
Shhh!!
All right.
How do ya do?
Tarry not upon our doorstep.
Please feel free to enter, all of ya.
Boy, you were some lucky kid.
Every summer for as long as I can remember... we'd be running all over this place.
I looked her straight into those big blue eyes.
It was you who killed Johnson.
Parker found out and you killed him.
Then you tried to get me.
It's your turn, sweetheart.
Now you're taking the fall.
There was a shot!
A puff of smoke!
We ran like the dickens!
- And that's how we got here.
- Wow!
Well, something like that.
And all on your own, too.
How convenient.
I mean...
- Remarkable.
- Yeah.
Junkyard refugees...
- in this house.
- What's the world coming to?
I wouldn't sew a stitch on that raggedy blanket.
If you could call it a blanket.
- Looks like an old diaper.
- It smells.
- It's raggedy.
- Get that thing away from me.
- Did someone wash that thing?
- No.
Yuck.
I'm nauseous.
Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?
Hey, look at this!!
Boy!!
He sure has grown.
What a heartbreaker!
He graduated, too!
Of course!
He knows how to work hard.
He's all big now.
- I hope he still needs us.
- Still needs you?
That's the silliest thing
I ever heard!
If it isn't old rabbit ears!
If it isn't old loudmouth!
- Hi, TV!
- How ya doing?
I've got a few more seasons left.
The cottage wasn't the same after they took you away.
Yeah, it wasn't as noisy.
I see you haven't changed.
Kind of gives you a sense of security.
[Blanky]
Where's the Master?
[TV]
No one told you?
Is he gonna be surprised when he gets back!
He just left to drive out to the...
[Speaking Spanish]
- Hey!
- What's the idea?
Oh, many pardons.
Was you watching that channel?
Come on in.
It's the greatest, isn't it?
You guys sure did some weird stuff with your furniture.
What happened?
This is... Gee!
Somebody trashed the whole cottage!
You big dumbo.
Didn't you lock the doors?
I don't believe
I've ever seen... quite so many smiles before.
I've never seen contraptions with so many... buttons and knobs and dials before.
Naturally.
We are on the cutting edge of technology.
- Wow.
- What does that mean?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
[Electronic Beeps]
Since you came here uninvited
We all knew you'd be delighted
This is not the time or place to hedge
No one here would be so bold to
But since you asked and no one's told you
Let us take you to the cutting edge
I can process words accounting too
And my pixel screen displays for you
Computer graphics locked into your memory
With fiber optics cast in plastic
For natural sights and sounds fantastic
Just reach out and talk to your dear old uncle Emery
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Let me tell you what it's for
Here's the printout with the score
Get yourself together on the edge
Ooo-ahh-ooo
You want to go to old
Rio deJaneiro, my dear
You want tojoin in any Club Paradise
You'd rather stay at home where the picture is clear
You get it on the stereo and you don't even have to go
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Any time or place you wish
You might meet up with some dish
Pull yourself together on the edge
If you want a lean machine to whip up some mean cuisine
I'm on the scene totally automatic
I can bake your biscuits too
Pop some dough boy out for you
I'm micro solid-state and that's no static
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
We're the bytes and chips to call
You just have yourself a ball
It's all hyperactive on the edge
From LEDs to CRTs, woofers tweeters, antenna trees
An ultra-nylon life of ease
Everything you dreamed of on the edge
- And more!
- And more!
Where's the toaster?
Where's the vacuum?
Whoa!
What's going on?
Where's the radio, the lamp and blanket?
Whoa!
[Engine Roar]
I'm glad the Master has such good appliances.
Yeah, couldn't get any more modern.
They're wonderful.
[Mom]
Honey, take some of our things.
This lamp would look so cute in your dorm room.
Go for it.
What are you going to read by?
I'll buy some candles.
I won't read.
I'll go out.
I'm not gonna take your stuff.
I'll just pick up a few cheap things this afternoon.
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
Appliances, cheap appliances... available now at
Ernie's Disposal.
Where's a good bargain place around here?
You should have gone for the new stuff.
Oh, were you in line first?
After you, of course!
Pardon me!
I can't take this kind of pressure
I must confess
One more dusty road
Would just be a road too long
Worthless
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't seem to get started
I don't have the heart to live in the fast lane
All that is past and gone
Worthless
And there ain't nothing you can do about it!
Pardon me while I panic!
Worthless
Worthless
Worthless
No, that place is too expensive.
Cheap!
We're talking real cheap!
What about Rooney's down on 53rd?
They've got used vacuums and junk.
This just in.
Rooney's vacuums found to be... carcinogenic in recent lab tests!
Big, big tumors on those rats.
We've got photos to prove it... and I don't even want to look at them.
I come from
K.C., Missouri
And I got my kicks on Route 66
Every truck stop from Butte to M.O.
Motown to old Alabama
From Texarkana and east of Savannah
From Tampa to old Kokomo
Worthless
I once ran the Indy 500
I must confess
I'm impressed how I did
And I wonder how close that I came
Now I get a second sensation
I was the top of the line
Out of sight out of mind
So much for fortune and fame
A bargain in every buck!
A buck in every pocket!
A pocket in, uh, every trouser!
Ernie's Bargain Circus... where you ride the Ferris wheel of values... toward a better tomorrow.
Once took a Texan to a wedding
Once took a Texan to a wedding
He kept forgetting his loneliness
Letting his thoughts turn to home and return
I took a man to a graveyard
I beg your pardon
It's quite hard enough
Just living with the stuff
I have learned
Worthless
Let's go cruising and see what we can find.
Why wander endlessly through the sprawling wasteland... they call the city... when your dreams are all under one roof?
Our roof, corner of 3rd and E.
Crazy Ernie's
Amazing Emporium... of total bargain madness!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha!
Have you ever heard of this place before?
Looks pretty neat.
Once drove a surfer to sunset
There were bikinis and buns filled with weenies
Fellini just couldn't forget
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
From Zuma to Yuma the rumor was
I had a hand in the lay of the land
Get up and go hit the highway
Ooo-ooo
I worked on a reservation
Ooo-ooo
Who would believe they would love me
And leave on a bus back to old Santa Fe
Once in an
Indian nation
I took the kids on the skids
With a Hopi was happy to lie in the shade
You're worthless
This sure doesn't look like...
Crazy Ernie's Amazing Emporium of total bargain madness.
- It's the right address.
- Hmm.
Oh!
At least we'll all go together.
That's looking at the bright side, isn't it?
The Master's down there!
Look!
- It's him!
- What? Where?
Why look, it is him!!
Maybe he still needs us!
Yeah!
Chris?
Hey, these are hard to find.
This is me.
What?
I can't hear you.
I don't get it.
There he is.
I can't believe it.
Freeze.
Here he comes.
[Clink-Clink]
You jump off one side,
I'll jump off the other.
Okay, I got it.
Which side?
- Right side.
- Okay.
I'm glad we don't have to do this every day.
Look!
Hey Rob, come here.
What?
Doggone it!
- He's coming back.
- He'll see us this time.
Run!
This looks just like my old blanket.
I think it is my blanket.
That's my radio.
Hey, Chris!
And the lamp!
Hey, Chris!
Wait a minute!
These are mine.
Let go!
Whoa!
Let me down!
Aaah!
Chris! Help!
Where are you?
Rob?
Chris!
Aaah!
Whew!
Would you cool it?
Get down here.
You're scaring me to death.
Really now.
Why don't you just buy a new one?
Where could I find another toaster like this?
Like that?
Probably nowhere.
Ah-ha!
Bye, Mom.
I love you.
I'll call you tonight.
You forgot your sweater!!
We did good, didn't we?
Yep, we did good.
You know,
I've been thinking.
This college business seems like a good idea.
I can absorb a lot of interesting facts.
I'm picking up a news flash!
President Roosevelt has declared today a national holiday... in honor of those five amazing appliances we've heard about.
So lock up the office, take down the top... and open that rumble seat!
Last one to Coney Island is a party pooper.
From the starlight roof high atop the Ritz... we wish our intrepid little friends... the best of luck... and a fond farewell!
Ah, you're all a bunch of junk.
Slave in the Magic Mirror, come from the farthest space.
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.
Speak!
Let me see thy face.
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?
Magic Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.
But hold, a lovely maid I see.
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.
Alas, she is more fair than thee.
Alas for her! Reveal her name.
Lips red as the rose.
Hair black as ebony.
Skin white as snow.
Snow White!
Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
We are standing by a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing
For the one I love
- To find me
- To find me
- Today
- Today
- I'm hoping
- I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of
- The nice things
- The nice things
- He'll say
- He'll say
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing
For the one I love
- To find me
- To find me
- Today
- Today
- Oh!
- Hello.
- Oh.
- Did I frighten you?
Wait! Wait, please.
Don't run away.
Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One song
I have but one song
One song only for you
One heart tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true
One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through
One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you
Take her far into the forest.
Find some secluded glade where she can pick wildflowers.
Yes, Your Majesty.
And there, my faithful Huntsman, you will kill her!
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!
Silence!
You know the penalty if you fail.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But to make doubly sure you do not fail, bring back her heart in this.
One song,
I have but one song
Hello there.
What's the matter?
Where's your mama and papa?
Why, I believe you're lost.
Oh, please don't cry.
Come on, perk up.
Won't you smile for me?
That's better.
Your mama and papa can't be far.
There they are!
Can you fly?
Good-bye. Good-bye!
I can't, I can't do it.
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.
I don't understand!
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!
- But, but who?
- The Queen.
- The Queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.
Run away, hide!
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!
Now, go. Go! Go!
Run! Run! Hide!
Oh!
Please don't run away.
I won't hurt you.
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
But you don't know what I've been through.
And all because I was afraid.
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.
What do you do when things go wrong?
Oh! You sing a song!
With a smile and a song
Life is just like a bright, sunny day
Your cares fade away
And your heart is young
With a smile and a song
All the world seems to waken anew
Rejoicing with you
As the song is sung
There's no use in grumbling
When raindrops come tumbling
Remember you're the one
Who can fill the world with sunshine
When you smile and you sing
Everything is in tune and it's spring
And life flows along
With a smile and a song
I really feel quite happy now.
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.
Everything's going to be all right.
But I do need a place to sleep at night.
I can't sleep in the ground like you or in a tree the way you do.
And I'm sure no nest would possibly be big enough for me.
Maybe you know where I can stay.
In the woods somewhere?
You do?
Will you take me there?
Oh, it's adorable!
Just like a doll's house.
I like it here.
Ooh, it's dark inside.
Guess there's no one home.
Hello?
May I come in?
Shh!
Oh!
What a cute little chair!
Why, there's seven little chairs!
Must be seven little children.
And from the look of this table, seven untidy little children.
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!
And a shoe!
And just look at that fireplace.
It's covered with dust.
And look, cobwebs everywhere!
My, my, my!
What a pile of dirty dishes!
And just look at that broom!
Why, they've never swept this room.
You'd think their mother would...
Maybe they have no mother.
Then they're orphans.
That's too bad.
I know!
We'll clean the house and surprise them.
Then maybe they'll let me stay.
Now, you wash the dishes.
You tidy up the room.
You clean the fireplace.
And I will use the broom.
Just whistle while you work
And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place
So hum a merry tune
It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace
And as you sweep the room
Imagine that the broom
Is someone that you love and soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.
When hearts are high the time will fly
So whistle while you work
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
Not under the rug.
So whistle while you work
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
In our mine the whole day through
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig is what we like to do
It ain't no trick to get rich quick
If ya dig, dig, dig with a shovel or a pick
- In a mine
- In a mine
Where a million diamonds
- Shine
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
From early morn 'til night
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig up everything in sight
We dig up diamonds by the score
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more
Though we don't know what we dig 'em for
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig
Heigh-ho
Heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho...
Let's see what's upstairs.
Oh, what adorable little beds!
And look, they have their names carved on them.
Doc, Happy,
Sneezy, Dopey...
What funny names for children!
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.
I'm a little sleepy myself.
Oh! Oh!
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

Look!
Our house! The lit's light...
Uh, the light's lit.
Jiminy Crickets!
The door is open.
The chimney's smoking.
Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.
Or a dragon.
Mark my words, there's trouble a-brewin'.
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.
What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.
Yes.
We'll, uh, squeak up... Sneak up.
Come on, hen... Uh, men. Follow me.
Psst!
Shh!
Shh!
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...
Hook and granny...
Crooked fan...
Search everywhere.
Shh!
Quiet.
Look! The floor, it's been swept!
Hah!
Chair's been dusted!
Our window's been washed.
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.
Why, why, why, why, the whole place is clean!
There's dirty work afoot.
Sink's empty.
Hey, someone stole our dishes!
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.
My cup's been washed.
Sugar's gone.
Something's cooking.
Smells good!
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.
See? It's witches' brew.
Look what's happened to our stable... Uh, table.
Flowers!
- Huh?
- Look, goldenrod.
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I... Oh.
Ah...
Ahhh...
Thanks!
Hey!
Shh!
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.
It's coming.
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.
Oh! Ah... Ah... Ah!
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.
Make a hard knot.
There, that will hold him.
- Thanks!
- Shh!
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?
- What's that?
- That's it.
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.
One of us has gotta go down and chase it up.
Up. Down.
Here, take it.
Don't be nervous.
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.
Yes! Right behind ya.
Here it comes!
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.
Hold it shut.
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.
Get it now!
- Quick!
- Give it to it!
Don't let it get away!
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?
What was it doin'?
He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds!
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.
Yeah, while it's sleeping.
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.
We'll kill it dead.
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!
- Gee!
- What a monster!
It covers three beds.
Let's kill it before it wakes up.
- Which end do we kill?
- Shh!
Shh!
Well, eh, ah...
- What is it?
- Why, it... It's a girl!
She's mighty purdy.
She's beautiful, just like a angel.
Angel, hah! She's a female!
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.
What are wicked wiles?
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.
Shh!
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.
Aw, let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.
- Look out.
- She's movin'.
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?
Hide.
Oh, dear.
I wonder if the children are...
Oh!
Why, why, you're little men!
How do you do?
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.
I know, you're Doc.
Why, why, why, yes.
Yes! That's true.
And you're, you're Bashful.
Oh, gosh!
And you, you're Sleepy.
How'd you guess?
And you?
And you're Sneezy.
- Yes, and you must be...
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.
You mean he can't talk?
He don't know. He never tried.
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh!
You must be Grumpy.
Oh, yes! Yes!
Hah! We know who we are.
Ask her who she is and what she's a-doin' here.
Hmph! Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?
What are you... Who are you, my dear?
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.
Snow White?
The Princess?
Yes.
Well... Well, my, my dear Quincess... Uh, Princess.
We're, uh, we're honored.
Yes, we're, uh, we're...
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?
Nothing! Just standin' there sputterin' like a doodlebug!
Who, who, who, who's butterin' like a spoodledug?
- Who's... Uh, gutter...
- Aw, shut up and tell her to get out!
Please don't send me away!
- If you do, she'll kill me.
Kill you?
Who will?
Yes, who?
- My stepmother, the Queen.
The Queen?
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!
I'm warnin' ya.
If the Queen finds her here, she'll swoop down and wreak her vengeance on us!
But she doesn't know where I am!
She don't, eh? She knows everything.
She's full of black magic.
She can even make herself invisible.
Pfft!
Might be in this room right now.
Oh, she'll never find me here.
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.
I'll wash and sew and sweep and cook and...
Cook?
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Uh, lumple dapplins?
Apple dumplings!
- Eh, yes!
Crapple dumpkins.
Yes, and plum pudding and gooseberry pie...
Gooseberry pie?
Hooray! She stays!
Ah!
Soup!
Hooray!
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
Just a minute.
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.
Wash? Wash?
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.
'Tain't New Year's.
Oh, perhaps you have washed.
Perhaps we...
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?
When? When. Uh, you said whe...
Why, last week.
Why, recently!
Yes, recently!
Oh, recently!
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!
Come on, let's see them.
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!
And you?
Worse than I thought!
Oh!
How shocking!
Goodness me, this will never do.
March straight outside and wash, or you'll not get a bite to eat.
Hah!
Well, aren't you going to wash?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Oh! Did you hurt yourself?
Hah, women!
Courage, men, courage.
Don't be nervous.
Gosh, it's wet!
It's cold, too!
We ain't gonna do it, are we?
Well, it'll please the Princess.
I'll take a chance for her!
Me, too!
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.
But I'm warnin' ya, you give 'em an inch, and they'll walk all over ya!
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?
Do ya get in the tub?
Do ya have to wash where it doesn't show?
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.
Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace
Just pull up your sleeves and get 'em in place
Then scoop up the water and rub it on your face and go...
Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff
Work up a lather
And when you got enough
Get your hands full of water and you snort and you snuff and go...
You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub
You sputter and splash all over the tub
You may be cold and wet when you're done
But you gotta admit it's good and clean fun
So splash all you like
'Tain't any trick
As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...
Hah! Next thing ya know she'll be tyin' your beards up in pink ribbons and smellin' ya up with that stuff called "perfoom. "
Hah!
A fine bunch of water lilies you turned out to be.
I'd like to see anybody make me wash if I didn't wanna.
Get him!
Hey, let go of me!
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...
Get the soap!
Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.
Never say die. Never say die.
You don't...
Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied
That he'll look mighty cute as soon as he's dried
Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go...
Ain't he sweet?
Smells like a petunia.
He sure is cute!
You'll pay dearly for this!
Supper!
- Supper!
Food. Hooray!
Hah!
Magic Mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?
Over the seven jeweled hills beyond the seventh fall, in the cottage of the seven dwarfs dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.
Snow White lies dead in the forest.
The Huntsman has brought me proof.
Behold her heart.
Snow White still lives, the fairest in the land.
'Tis the heart of a pig you hold in your hand.
The heart of a pig!
Then I've been tricked!
The heart of a pig!
The blundering fool!
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage in a disguise so complete no one will ever suspect.
Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness, change my queenly raiment to a peddler's cloak.
Mummy Dust to make me old.
To shroud my clothes, the black of night.
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.
A blast of wind to fan my hate!
A thunderbolt
To mix it well.
Now, begin thy magic spell.
Look!
My hands!
My voice!
My voice.
A perfect disguise.
And now...
A special sort of death for one so fair.
What shall it be?
Ah!
A poisoned apple!
Sleeping Death.
I'd like to dance and tap my feet
But they won't keep in rhythm
You see, I washed 'em both today and I can't do nothin' with 'em
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing
Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
I...
Oh, gosh!
I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing
Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...
Watch... Watch...
Thanks.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hooray!
That was fun!
Now you do something.
Well, what shall I do?
- Tell us a story.
Yes, tell us a story.
- A true story.
- A love story.
Well, once there was a princess.
Was the princess you?
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?
Oh, it was very easy.
Anyone could see that the Prince was charming.
The only one for me.
Was he strong and handsome?
Was he big and tall?
There's nobody like him anywhere at all.
Did he say he loved ya?
Did he steal a kiss?
He was so romantic
I could not resist
Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever
I know
Hah! Mush!
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true
Oh, my goodness!
It's past bedtime.
Go right upstairs to bed.
Wait! Hold on there, men!
The, uh, Princess will sleep in our beds upstairs.
But where will you sleep?
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable down here in... in...
In a pig's eye!
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.
Now don't you worry about us.
We'll be all right, ma'am.
Go right on up now, my dear.
Well, if you insist.
Good night.
Good night, Princess.
You're sure you'll be comfortable?
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.
Well, pleasant dreams.
Pleasant dreams.
Let go!
- I saw it first!
Now, men, don't get excited.
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!
Bless the seven little men who have been so kind to me.
And... And may my dreams come true.
Amen.
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.
Hah! Women!
A fine kettle of fish!
Dip the apple in the brew.
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!
Look! On the skin!
The symbol of what lies within.
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.
To make her hunger for a bite.
Have a bite?
It's not for you.
It's for Snow White.
When she breaks the tender peel to taste the apple in my hand, her breath will still, her blood congeal.
Then I'll be fairest in the land!
But wait!
There may be an antidote.
Nothing must be overlooked.
Oh, here it is!
"Love's First Kiss. "
Bah!
No fear of that.
The dwarfs will think she's dead.
She'll be buried alive!
Buried alive!
Thirsty?
Have a drink!
Now, don't forget, my dear.
The... The old Queen's a sly one, full of witchcraft.
So beware of strangers.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
See you tonight.
Uh, yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.
Be awful careful
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...
- Good-bye.
- Oh, gosh!
Hah! Disgustin'!
And be sure to watch out...
To wa... To wa...
To wa...
Watch out.
Thanks.
Well... All right.
But that's the last... Wha...
Oh, go on. Run along.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
Heigh-ho
Good-bye! Good-bye!
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.
Why, Grumpy, you do care.
Hah!
Good-bye, Grumpy!
The little men will be away and she'll be all alone with a harmless old peddler woman.
A harmless old peddler woman!
Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true
All alone, my pet?
Why, why, yes, I am. But...
The, the little men are not here?
No, they're not, but...
Mmm-hmm.
Making pies?
Yes, gooseberry pies.
It's apple pies that make the menfolks' mouths water.
Pies made from apples like these.
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.
Like to try one?
Hmm?
Go on. Go on, have a bite.
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!
Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady.
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.
There, there. I'm sorry.
Oh! My heart!
Oh, my... My poor heart.
Take me into the house and let me rest.
A drink of water, please.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Hey, look!
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!
Go on! Get outta here!
What ails these crazy birds?
They've gone plumb daffy.
Yeah, they've...
And because you've been so good to poor old Granny,
I'll share a secret with you.
This is no ordinary apple.
It's a magic wishing apple.
A wishing apple?
Yes!
One bite and all your dreams will come true.
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.
Now, make a wish and take a bite.
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.
- 'Tain't natural.
There's something wrong.
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.
Maybe the old Queen's got Snow White.
- The Queen!
Snow White!
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?
Yes, yes, what'll we do?
Come on! Giddap!
Wait for me! Wait for...
There must be something your little heart desires.
Perhaps there's someone you love.
Well, there is someone.
I thought so. I thought so!
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.
Now, take the apple, dearie, and make a wish.
I wish... I wish...
That's it, go on! Go on.
And that he will carry me away to his castle where we will live happily ever after.
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.
Don't let the wish grow cold!
Oh, I feel strange.
- Her breath will still.
- Oh. Oh.
- Her blood congeal.
- Oh.
Now I'll be fairest in the land!
Hurry, hurry.
There she goes!
After her!
I'm trapped! What will I do?
The meddling little fools!
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!
Look out!
One song
One song
I have but one song
- One song
- One song
- Only for you
- For you
One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
- Constant and true
- So true
- One love
- One love
That has possessed me
- One love
- One love
- Thrilling me through
- So true
- One song
- One song
- My heart keeps singing
- Keeps singing
- Of one love
- One love
Only for you...
And away to his castle you'll go
To be happy forever we know
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Grumpy.
Good-bye.
Oh, Dopey.
Good-bye!
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true!
Every night, the same dream, the same strange planet.
But why?
What are they trying to tell me?
It's been 34 years since they arrived on this planet.
And not a day passes that the survivors...
...forced to live in barrier cities, do not live in fear.
I have vowed to end that fear.
I believe my dreams hold the key.
The question is, will I be in time to save the Earth?
Where are you?
This is a restricted area.
Do not move!
- What's she doing here captain?
- I don't know, but we're getting her out.
- You're coming with us.
- Behind you!
Hold it right there!
Damn it. Let's move, people!
Two coming through the wall!
Hold your fire.
Those tanks are flammable!
Ryan, Neil, let's go!
- Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
- There's a life form in here.
- There hasn't been life here in years.
- Well, there is now.
Life form or not, I'm taking you in.
Fine! Arrest me. But I'm not leaving without that life form.
It's gonna be one of those days.
Captain, the transport is not going to wait for us much longer.
- I understand that.
- It's in bad shape.
Oh please! Tell me we're not risking our necks for this plant!
I wouldn't even call it a plant.
It's a weed.
- I wouldn't even call it a weed.
- I need a minute to extract it.
Miss. That's a minute we do not have.
I'm afraid he's right about that ma'am.
Phantoms! We have incoming.
- Captain, we need to get out of here.
- Understood, sergeant.
- Could you hurry please Miss?
- Done.
- Captain?
- Yes, Neil?
Just so you know?
I agree with the "let's get out of here thing. "
Duly noted.
- Can I have this, please?
- Thank you.
- We're surrounded!
- No shit!
- Alright everybody! Just relax.
- Captain, we gotta get to higher ground.
Everyone, up top!
Go, go, go!
- Transport, requesting immediate evac.
- Affirmative.
Up here!
- Captain! - They're right behind you! - Captain, come on!
I've got you!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
All right, everybody, here they come.
You okay?
You gonna be all right.
Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't arrest you?
I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.
- Not unlimited clearance. Not without authorization.
- Listen captain. I don't have time for this.
Do you realize you just risked the lives of my squad?
Look! I don't wanna talk about it.
The fact of the matter is...
- ... it was worth the lives of you and your men.
- You and your men?
- She thinks you're a man.
- I think she's an idiot.
- I know you're not a man.
- I think you're an idiot too.
- Very funny.
- Well, I do wanna talk about it.
Did it ever occur to you...
...that we would've volunteered to risk our lives had we been given a choice?
Well, nobody asked you to save me.
I don't believe this.
You have not changed a bit!
Gray?
Yeah. Nice to see you too.
- Welcome back, captain.
- We're clean.
- Let's make sure of that shall we?
- I hate getting scanned.
So, the scanners are probably worse for us than the Phantoms.
No probably about it captain.
These machines are suspected of causing sterility.
And I wanna have a little Neil Jr. calling me Daddy someday.
- That's a spooky thought.
- Why are you always busting my chops?
People, let's just do this thing. Alright?
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, next.
Looks like you've gained some weight.
It's called upper-body strength, Neil.
Get a girlfriend.
I'm working on it.
You know, my security rating allows me to bypass this.
Not today it doesn't.
Something's not right.
- About this mission? Or that woman?
- Both.
Next.
Listen, captain.. I think...
I don't care what you think, doctor.
You're getting scanned just like everybody else.
Oh shit!
- Captain!
- They got him.
There must be a mistake.
You came in contact with a Phantom sir.
Please remain calm.
Administering treatment shield.
- What level is he?
- Blue. It will be code red in 3-1/2 minutes.
We have to treat him. Now!
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.
We'll transfer him to the treatment center.
There's no time for that.
Get him to the table.
Hang in there, captain.
Locating pathogens.
Jesus, look at that thing!
- How much more time?
- Not enough.
When he reaches code red, the treatment shield won't be able to hold the alien particles.
Engaging bio-etheric laser.
- What's going on?
- Where'd it go?
What the hell is going on?
We've lost contact.
Infestation is moving deeper.
- Tracking.
- There's no time.
- Tracking.
- There is no time! You're gonna lose him!
His treatment shield is failing.
Found it.
Come on.
It's all right.
Don't worry.
You'll be back to normal in no time.
Uh.. Doctor, we need to scan you for infestation.
That won't be necessary.
I'll take responsibility.
Hey, doc.
Thanks for saving him.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but the military has impounded my ship.
- What's with her?
- What's with her and the captain?
What's with her and that stupid plant?
What?
Forward me the Phantom data and everything regarding the five spirits collected so far.
Yes, doctor.
Spirits? I thought we weren't supposed to use the "S" word.
Don't get smart with me.
Now let's see if that plant does the trick.
It's a match. We've found it.
Yes.
The sixth spirit.
It seemed today you broke nearly every protocol.
How long do you think this would have survived outside the barrier?
Aki, you know there are elements in the council and military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down.
Look, 20 years ago, who discovered this energy in the Phantoms? You.
And who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?
You. You made it possible to harness that energy...
...for ovo-pacs, scanners, even the barrier.
The council knows that.
They trust you doctor.
We're so close to proving it.
But we still need this part.
And this one here.
Exactly two more pieces and we've solved the puzzle!
And we need to be free to find those pieces.
I want to show you something Aki.
- What is this?
- Read.
"All life is born of Gaia and each life has a spirit.
Each new spirit is housed in a physical body. "
- Doctor?
- Go on.
"Through their experiences on Earth, each spirit matures and grows.
When the physical body dies...
...the mature spirit, enriched by its life on Earth, returns to Gaia...
...bringing with it the experiences...
...enabling Gaia to live and grow. "
It's my old diary.
I wrote that 43 years ago, when I was the age you are now.
Dr. Sid!
Remember what happened to Galileo?
They threw him in jail because...
...he said the Earth was not the center of the universe.
That could happen to us.
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.
If you have any notes or records that could be used against you...
...destroy them.
- Keep them up here.
- Right.
And stay away from your friend, the captain.
He saves your life, you save his life, this leads to that.
I was young once too, you know.
Doctor, there is a war going on.
No one's young anymore.
Ladies and gentlemen of the council...
...could you please explain why?
Zeus was completed a month ago.
If we attack the meteor with this, we will eliminate the Phantoms at their source.
General Hein, calm down.
At our last meeting, We voted 6 to 2...
...to postpone using the Zeus cannon to attack the Leonid Meteor.
We have re-convened today to vote on that very issue again.
Now, I'd like to ask the director of the Bio-Etheric Center to speak.
- Dr. Sid, please.
- Thank you.
As you all know, the Phantoms' nest is in the Leonid Meteor...
...that landed here 34 years ago.
What you see now are the records of every assault on the meteor to date.
Physical attacks have had utterly no effect.
This scene took place three months ago during a full-scale bombardment.
Now please note the Phantoms outside the meteor are indeed destroyed.
However, inside, many that were dormant come to life...
...and as you see, overall Phantom density remains the same.
The newly risen aliens respond to the attack...
...by burrowing even deeper into the Earth.
Now, this is very interesting to me Dr. Sid...
...because we see the same thing during surgery...
...when using bio-etheric lasers on Phantom particles, do we not?
Yes, indeed we do.
You see. the injured particles escape...
...burying or digging themselves deeper into a patient's body.
And when we increase the laser power to destroy these deeper particles...
...we have had incidents resulting in further injury to a patient...
...and in some cases...
...death.
And what exactly does that mean doctor?
It means there's a very good chance...
...the beam from the Zeus cannon will burn the Phantoms in the meteor.
Exactly! Thank you.
However, it also means that the beam energy may be too strong...
...injuring the Earth.
Injure the Earth?
You mean the Gaia.
- I mean...
- You mean the spirit of the Earth.
Yes, the spirit of the Earth.
Did he say what I think he said?
What are you doing?
I know what I'm doing and whatever you do, keep your mouth shut.
This is ridiculous.
Doctor, with all due respect...
...did you come here just to talk about some Gaia theory?
To tell us that the planet is alive?
That it has a spirit?
That's a fairy tale doctor and I'm sorry, but we don't have time for that.
It is not a fairy tale. It is true.
Ahh.. Oh.. So if I point a gun at the Earth and fire...
...I'm not just making a hole on the ground,
I'm killing the planet.
Dr. Sid, the Gaia theory has not been proven.
Even if Gaia does exist, won't we still have to remove the Phantoms?
I think if there's any chance of success, we should take it.
- Don't you agree?
- Well, of course i do.
But there is an alternative to the space cannon.
Another method?
- Yes. A means of disabling the Phantoms.
- Please.
As we know, the aliens display a distinct energy pattern.
Now, it is a fact that two opposing bio-etheric waves...
...placed one over the other will cancel each other out.
It is theoretically possible to construct a wave pattern...
...in direct opposition to the Phantom energy.
We are currently assembling such a wave and are nearing completion.
Members of the council...
...gathering plants and animals...
...from around the world to fight the Phantoms is utter nonsense.
The Zeus cannon is a proven, effective weapon.
It will kill Phantoms.
Can we afford to wait for some crazy invention...
...some army of touchy-feely plants and animals...
...An invention that offers no solid evidence that it will destroy the aliens?
There is evidence!
Our partially completed energy wave...
...has successfully stopped
Phantom particles from spreading...
...through a terminally-infected patient.
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence that a terminal patient has been cured?
Not cured. The wave is not complete.
But we've succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient.
Where is the proof?
Here.
You may have bought us some time Aki, but i wonder at what cost?
Doctor, I can't keep hiding in the background while you protect me.
I want what life I have left to mean something.
Will you listen to me? When we find the seventh and eighth spirits...
If we find them.
What we need now is some luck.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
Faith and hard work, girl...
...coz I'll be damned if you're going to die before me.
The council decided to postpone firing the Zeus cannon.
I guess I put on a good show.
Mind if I tag along?
You'll probably get bored.
So, what are you doing?
Oh, I see. You're giving me the silent treatment.
I'm scanning the city for the seventh spirit.
Hurry up, Neil.
- Relax sergeant. Almost got it.
- What do you think you're doing?
We're just gonna strand them for a while.
Hey, don't look at me. It was his idea.
This was your idea?
We're just helping the captain out a little.
Yeah, come on Jane.
Where's your sense of romance?
You've seen how the captain looks at her.
It's amore, baby.
What's going on?
It's probably just a glitch.
- Listen, Aki...
- I'm still mad at you.
- You're mad at me?
- Leaving your helmet on.
Not telling me who you were.
That doesn't seem a little childish?
Hey! Well, I was just a little upset when you just packed up and left for the Zeus Station without saying a word.
- Well, now you know what was going on. Alright?
- Yeah. Now I know.
My operation had to be done in zero grav. Okay?
Fine.
And how about the fact that I was sent there on a job and you wouldn't even see me.
I was probably helping Dr. Sid collect spirit waves.
- Well, now I know.
- So I'm sorry!
Well, me too! So we're both sorry.
So will you tell me about them?
About what?
About the spirits you've collected.
I was infected by a Phantom during an experiment.
- Normally, no one could have survived.
- How did you?
Dr. Sid created a membrane around the infection, keeping me alive.
So the first spirit wave was me.
- The second was a fish.
- A fish?
The third was a deer I found in a wildlife preserve outside Moscow.
The fourth was a bird.
Ever tried to track a sparrow from outer space? It's no fun.
- What am I saying? You probably would love that.
- You're right. I probably would.
And then there was that plant
I collected from Times Square.
- I thought that was number six.
- What?
You skipped one.
The fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room.
I retrieved the sample in time, but she...
I told her everything had a spirit:
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls.
Even the Earth.
I told her that she wasn't dying just returning to the Earth's spirit...
...to Gaia.
She told me that she was ready to die.
She said I didn't have to make up stories to make her feel better.
Only 7 years old and ready to die.
I'm sorry.
I have work to do. I have to find the seventh and eighth spirits.
Don't, please.
You don't believe any of this, do you?
I just don't know, Aki.
Is this why you shut me out?
You should have told me.
I don't know how much time I have left.
Who does?
I better get back to scanning.
Captain Edwards...
...you extracted a Dr. Ross from
Old New York several days ago did you not?
- Yes, sir.
- What were your impressions of Dr. Ross?
She seemed very capable and determined, sir.
You and the Deep Eyes are being temporarily reassigned.
You will guard Dr. Ross when she reenters the wasteland.
- Understood, sir.
- You don't understand yet, captain.
Report any aberrant behavior in Dr. Ross to the major immediately.
Aberrant behavior sir?
The woman carries an alien infestation, captain.
We don't know what it may be doing to her.
The alien presence could be affecting her judgment.
They may be manipulating the doctor for their very own purposes.
Is the general suggesting that Dr. Ross is a spy?
The general is wondering why he's explaining himself to a captain.
She's had prolonged exposure to Phantom tissue.
If this begins to manifest itself in any way...
...Dr. Ross is to be placed under arrest and transported here for observation.
It is, in fact, for her own good, captain.
Of course, sir.
Major, send some of our men to keep an eye on the good captain.
I'm convinced that these dreams are some form of communication.
Their message still eludes me...
...but they're coming faster now and that can only mean one thing.
The Phantoms inside me are beginning to win.
Our target is 50 klicks west of Tucson.
- Roger.
- Phantom concentration?
Not good. We've got big metas everywhere.
So it's gonna be a real picnic.
Stick close to me. No heroics today. Okay?
Everything by the book.
By the book. Right.
If we drop energy buoys here, here and here...
...we should be able to land, acquire the target, and get out before the Phantoms even know we were there.
And the buoys will attract the Phantoms?
- Yeah.
- For a while.
So you're from the 307th's right?
Under General Hein?
Ever done wasteland recon before?
It can get pretty ugly.
Captain, rendezvous for evac at vector 6, coordinate 279.
Roger that. Stay alert for hostiles.
Looks like they've taken the bait.
The seventh spirit should be just beyond that line of wreckage.
I don't see how any living thing could survive out here?
We'll find out soon enough.
This was the Phantom Cleansing Mission.
It was supposed to end the war.
My father's in here somewhere.
All right.
Let's move out, people.
I'll be damned.
A survivor.
What's it doing out here?
Hoping for life to return.
Is that our spirit, doc?
No.
We're closing in on the life form.
- Distance?
- Hard to say. We're very close.
I don't see anything.
- You're not gonna tell me it's him?
- That's impossible.
It's not the soldier. It's his ovo-pac.
How do you explain that? The pacs power our weapons, the barrier cities...
I mean it's just bio-etheric energy.
And to create that energy we use living tissue. Single-cell organisms.
- You're telling me his backpack is the seventh spirit?
- Yes.
We have incoming. Captain? Do you read me?
- Captain?
- What? Say again?
You read me captain? We have incoming.
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.
I need a hand! Sarge!
- Those buoys? They're not working.
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.
Let's get the hell out of here!
Something's not right.
This shouldn't be happening.
Something's attracting them.
Aki!
- They're right on us, sir. Closing in fast!
- Jane, take the lead.
Fire in the hole!
Get us out of here, Neil.
- Sir, I would love to, but...
- Just do it!
- Sir?
- It's okay, that's it.
That doesn't look good, captain.
We have to get her to a hospital.
- You have your orders, sir.
- What the hell is going on here?
Dr. Ross is to be taken into custody now, sir.
Lower your weapons. That's an order!
Sir. We have no choice, but to relieve you of your command.
I won't let you do this soldier.
You'll gonna have to shoot me.
Stand down, captain!
Hang on, everyone!
That's enough.
Hands where I can see them. Everyone now!
Deep Eyes, hard to starboard!
Neil, get us back to New York, fast!
The Deep Eyes are returning from the wasteland, sir.
Apparently, there was an incident.
It would seem the Phantoms were attracted to Dr. Ross.
The crew barely escaped with their lives.
And sir, Captain Edwards is still in command.
Issue an order.
I want Edwards and Dr. Ross placed under arrest.
All research materials pertaining to Dr. Sid's wave theory...
...are to be confiscated immediately.
That might not go over too well with the council, sir.
What a tragedy that would be.
This is perfect, major.
The good captain has opened the door for us.
By tomorrow morning, the council will be at our feet...
...thanking us for exposing the traitors and imploring us...
...to save them from the Phantoms.
How is she, doctor?
- She is dying.
- There must be something you can do.
Aki is fighting with only six of the eight spirits.
We'll have to implant the seventh directly into her chest plate.
It took a bullet.
I think it might be damaged.
We have to repair this panel quickly.
Her vital signs are dropping.
Aki is slipping away from us.
She needs a sympathetic spirit to help hold her in this world.
And I can think of no spirit better suited for that task than yours, captain.
- I don't understand.
- You don't have to understand.
You just be with her now.
You keep her here with us.
Aki? Where are we?
On an alien planet.
How is that possible?
I'm not entirely sure.
You seem pretty calm.
I've been having this dream every night for months.
Dream?
Well, whatever it is.
You're really here, aren't you?
What's happening to me?
Dr. Sid is implanting the seventh spirit directly into your body.
Then you're my spiritual support.
Gray, how sweet of you.
Look, I don't think you realize how serious this situation is.
Something you should see here, sir.
And I am watching what, major?
It seems Dr. Ross has been recording her dreams.
And why would I be interested in...
...her dreams?
This is it. This is our evidence.
She's under the influence of the Phantoms.
Dr. Ross' dreams should be all the council needs to authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.
The council is content to hide powering inside this barrier...
...while the world dies a little more every day.
I believe they need a push in the right direction, major.
Get together a group of your most trusted men.
What are they doing.
Why are they staring at us?
Not at us.
Welcome back, captain.
Is it over?
How is she, doctor?
She's gonna be fine.
But this is only temporary.
We'll need to find the eighth and final spirit to cure her.
Aki, can you hear me?
I finished it.
I know what it means.
I know what the Phantoms really are.
Nobody move! You're all under arrest!
We have them, sir.
Sir?
My wife and daughter...
...were killed by Phantoms in the
San Francisco Barrier City was attacked.
Did I ever tell you that?
I try to imagine what.. what that must have been like...
...seeing everyone around you fall over dead for no apparent reason.
And then, at the end, feeling something next to you...
...invisible...
...touching you...
...reaching inside your body...
You've lost family, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
That's why I trust you.
All of you.
You know what must be done.
Security override.
Perimeter breached.
Major, arrest these men.
- Take it easy.
- Stand up. Go.
You are relieved of your post.
Don't ask any questions.
Reduce power to Sector 31.
Sir, you do realize that the Phantoms...
What I realize, major...
...is that we must force the council to take action against the enemy.
25% of energy pipe alpha redirected.
Lowering power output to Sector 31.
Barrier breached in Sector 31, general.
They're coming through now.
Oh I think we can easily handle a few Phantoms in a contained space.
Relax, major. When this night's over, you're going to be a hero.
- Aki, I don't think...
- You were in my dream, Gray. You saw it.
That's just it. I'm not sure what I saw.
How can you be?
Captain, please, let her continue.
Alright. Why do you think we've never been able to determine...
...a relationship between the human-sized Phantoms and the giant ones roaming the wastelands?
Excuse me, doc, but what friggin' relationship?
I mean you got your human-sized Phantoms, and your creepy caterpillary Phantoms...
...and your flying Phantoms and let's not forget my personal favorite...
...the big, fat, giant Phantoms.
Down, boy.
He's right. If you've spent as much time in the field as we had...
...you know there is no relationship.
It's like a zoo out there.
Precisely. I think the giant ones are like our whales or elephants.
But why would an invading army bring a bunch of whales and elephants along for the ride?
Unless their ship was kind of a crazy Noah's Ark?
We have always assumed that the meteor...
...was intended as a form of transportation.
Perhaps it wasn't.
The meteor is a chunk of their planet that got thrown into space...
...when they destroyed their world.
But how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?
They didn't.
Oh. This is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense.
What do you think about all this, captain?
I think that explains why we never had a chance.
All our strategies are based on one assumption:
That we were fighting alien invaders.
Think of the dream, Gray. How they died.
Since then, all they've known is suffering.
They're not an invading army.
They're ghosts.
How many Phantoms?
More than enough to convince the council, sir.
Excellent. Sound an alert. Send a squad out to eliminate them.
Yes sir.
Alert status. Full deployment.
Sir. I have numerous Phantom contacts!
Well, of course you do.
Outside of Sector 31, sir.
And moving at incredible speed.
Major, What the hell is going on here?
They're in the pipes.
They're moving with the bio-etheric energy flow.
That's impossible. No living thing could survive in those pipes.
Well, we've got a big one heading this way.
Meta class, sir.
Oh, my God.
Hold your fire!
What have I done?
Come on, Neil. We need to find a way out.
You're our man. Think.
Captain, these walls are titanium alloy and the bars are pulse-sonic lasers.
I mean it's not like I can just wave a magic wand and...
- Wow! Neil, I'm impressed.
- That makes two of us.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
I think we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
- Here they come.
- But the others! Dr. Sid!
Deep Eyes'll take care of him.
Come on.
What's happening. Why can we see them now?
They must be carrying a residual charge from passing through the barrier.
Behind you!
All aboard, captain!
We need to find my ship.
If it was towed inside the city, it would be in the military hangar.
That's a big "if. "
Look out!
- Get us onto the platform.
- You got it.
Okay, now what?
We're going through the station.
- What?
- Captain, with all due respect...
- Excuse me, captain.
- The station.
We're going through it.
It's the only way.
So I gather this will be somewhat of a rough ride?
Doc, you've got a talent for understatement.
Hang on, everybody!
Doc?
Interesting.
- Anybody hurt?
- Captain.
Oh, God. Talk to me, sarge.
Ouch!
- Give me a hand, Jane.
- Right.
No wait! We're risking further injury.
We need the proper tools to cut him out.
They're in my ship.
- No. No, doc. No drugs.
- Captain?
You heard the man.
We'll find the ship and be back for you.
- I'll stay with him.
- Me too.
Nobody's staying.
- Just give me a gun.
- You got it.
Give him a weapon. Do it!
We'll be back for you, sergeant.
You hear me?
I hear you, captain.
Now, get out of here.
Let's move out.
A quad-axle ATV. This is good.
It can be used to retrieve Ryan and transport him safely here.
However, we'll need to replace these spent fuel cells.
There could be some live ovo-pacs in the hangar.
Alright. Jane, check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for takeoff.
Aki and Dr. Sid, prep the Quatro.
I'll go to the tower and rotate the airtray.
This city may be lost, but we are not.
Let's do this thing and get the hell out of here.
Gray, be careful.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Neil, do you read me?
Loud and clear, captain.
This baby'll fly itself.
Flight path is set.
Beginning rotation.
Stop the airtray. We have a problem.
I'm reading an impound tractor attached probably to the ship.
Can you disengage it from the cockpit?
No sir. Permission to go outside and detach the coupling.
Do it.
There's the problem.
The controls are locked, naturally.
Jane, let me ask you something.
You think we're gonna get out of here alive?
I mean I wonder if anybody else has gotten out.
You think anyone's made it this far? Huh?
You think this eighth-spirit stuff is really gonna work against the Phantoms?
I mean what if it's all a bunch of mumbo-jumbo?
Jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
I'm trying to concentrate here.
What's happening down there?
Nothing we can't handle.
- Neil, what's your status?
- Almost there.
I want you two back inside.
We're fine, sir. Jane is negotiating with extreme prejudice.
Talk to me, Jane.
No problem here, captain.
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.
Jane, get out of there.
Get out of there now! Go! Jane!
Get the hell out of there!
The shield is powered and ready.
- Where are you going?
- To the cockpit.
The ship is set on autopilot.
We're in countdown to liftoff.
No, wait. It's too dangerous. Aki!
Over here, you son of a bitch!
Gray, do you read me?
What's happening?
You and Sid are getting out of here now.
- No! We can't just leave everyone.
- Everyone's dead!
- I'm not leaving without you.
- I'm sorry, but you don't have a choice.
Goodbye, Aki.
Gray, come on!
I just...
I wish I could believe they were in a better place.
I enlarged the scanning perimeter...
...to include an area that we had previously overlooked.
The impact crater.
That's a strange place to find the eighth spirit.
Yes, really quite astonishing.
But nothing could survive in there except Phantoms.
Precisely.
Which suggests that the eighth spirit is a Phantom spirit.
I can't explain it at the moment, but once we get down there...
- ... you will understand...
- Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.
Yes, I expected that's how you would evaluate our chances.
Well, am I wrong?
No, I agree. We probably...
...won't live long enough to extract the eighth spirit from the crater.
Then why should we even try it?
Because we don't need to extract the eighth spirit.
If we can't bring the final spirit here...
...we can go there and complete the wave inside the crater.
Yes, exactly.
And how do we do that, exactly?
I can construct a device that...
...would attach to Aki's chest plate to gather the eighth spirit and then...
And then what?
And then we wait and see what happens.
That's it?
- That's your plan? We wait and see what happens?
- Yes.
Oh, good. Well, I got my own plan.
We keep scanning the surface from orbit...
- and maybe we'll find a compatible spirit somewhere else.
Aki?
I say we go in.
What caused the barrier to fail, General Hein?
I'm afraid it was only a matter of time...
...before the Phantoms developed an immunity to our barriers.
But I am relieved to see that you and the rest of the council...
...were able to evacuate to Houston without incident.
It was a terrible loss suffered this evening.
The council has reconsidered your proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.
I see.
We are transmitting the access codes to you now.
And, general...
...best of luck to us all.
Prepare to fire the cannon.
The target, sir?
The Phantom crater.
Preparing to drop in three, two, one.
Powering the shield.
Okay, we're over the meteor.
Do you have it in sight, doctor?
There are so many of them.
Wait.
Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit moving along the crater's surface.
All right. Now let's take a closer look.
Ready to fire in three minutes.
Ovo-pacs at maximum.
Transferring plasma flow to auto.
Counter-thrusters are engaged.
Lox flow de-coupled. Status is green.
We have something on radar over the impact site, sir.
It's her.
Sir?
Just a traitor under the influence of the enemy.
Continue the countdown.
We'll take them all out at the same time.
We're closing on the Phantom.
Contact in 30 seconds.
Target locked.
Ready to fire on your command.
It's a match! It's a perfect match!
- Target scanners ready, sir.
- Fire.
What was that?
It's the Zeus. They're firing on the crater.
- Aki, Captain, are you all right?
- A little shaken. Stand by.
Sid, the eighth spirit is not on our scanner. Do you have it?
The eighth spirit...
...has been destroyed.
- What are we going to do now?
- Nothing. This mission is over.
- We have to get out of here.
- Incoming!
What is that?
If you're getting us out of here, you better do it now.
Hold on!
I can't hold on to you.
Unable to maintain altitude.
Initiate emergency landing procedures.
Come in. Come in, please.
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?
Sid, I need to talk to the station.
Can you patch us through?
- What is that thing?
- I don't know, sir.
Incoming message, sir.
General Hein,
You must cease fire immediately.
What you are looking at in the crater is the living spirit of an alien's home world.
Their planet was destroyed and part of it landed here.
This is not an invasion. It never was.
I see and what have we been fighting all this time, doctor? Ghosts?
Yes. Spirits that are confused, lost and angry.
Right. And these spirits are coming out of this Gaia thing.
General Hein, you have to listen.
Alien Gaia, Earth Gaia.
Doctor, even if I believed in such nonsense...
...the fact remains the Earth is under attack from an aggressor...
...who must be destroyed at all costs.
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.
Firing on the alien Gaia will only make it stronger.
Well, since you're under the alien's influence, doctor,
I will take your protest to mean that we are...
...in fact pursuing the correct course of actions.
So i suggest you take your last few moments and prepare to meet your Gaia.
Continue to fire until the invader has been destroyed.
General, the system is overheating, sir.
We're going to hit it again and again and keep on hitting it until it's dead.
But, sir. We're not even sure if it's having any effect on the creature.
No effect? We've got them on the run, soldier.
This is our moment of victory. I order you to fire.
- The system won't allow us to fire again.
- We'll see about that.
Our shield is out. We're sitting ducks in here.
Come on!
This is not a good place to be.
What the hell is that?
That's not what I think it is, Is it?
Yes, it's Gaia.
This is definitely not a good place to be.
Hey, are you all right?
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.
Sid, do you read me?
Go ahead, I'm still here.
We're looking at Gaia.
Do you hear me, Sid? Gaia.
I think this explains why the eighth spirit appeared here.
Yes.
Yes, that's it!
A Phantom must have changed into the eighth spirit...
...when it touched a new life born from our own Gaia.
If so, it would've been given a different energy signature...
...that set it apart from the other Phantoms.
You two could not have hoped for a better location...
...to find a new compatible spirit.
Whatever you do, don't move.
Stay right where you are.
Staying right where we are may not be as easy as it sounds.
Don't shoot any of them!
You could very well destroy our last hope.
And what do you suggest I do, doctor?
Ask them to play nice?
Combat strategy is your area of expertise, captain, not mine.
I have a reading here in the fissure.
Do you see it?
Yes! A compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.
Well? Which one is it? Which one?
I'm having difficulty narrowing it down.
Just a moment, please.
Doctor, it's getting crowded in here.
Aki, we don't have much time. Aki.
With the hope of new life...
...has Gaia changed the Phantom within?
I have it.
Gray, get in here. I need you!
Do you hear me, Sid?
The wave pattern is complete.
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.
I don't see how you could have found the final spirit.
It found me, doctor.
Oh, my word.
I see now. I understand.
Well, I don't understand!
What the hell is going on?
Give me the ovo-pac.
I need to project the completed wave.
- But we'll be defenseless.
- Just do it!
I hope you know what you're doing, Aki.
- We can use the shield to project the wave.
- What?
Dr. Sid's theory was right.
I have it. The eighth spirit.
I'm cured, Gray.
- Are you sure you have the final spirit?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- But how? How can you know that?
- Don't worry. A Phantom told me.
Oh, great.
That's it. Shield on.
It's not working.
We have to do something before it's too late.
If this doesn't work, then it's already too late.
Gray, trust me.
I'll blast you all to hell.
Oh, no. No!
Get down!
- Warning. System overload.
- I know.
- Warning. System overload.
- I know!
But it must be done.
Fire.
Fire, damn you!
Fire!
Don't leave me, Gray.
Told Sid this was a one-way trip.
Looks like I was right.
No, Gray. Hang on, please.
I still have the wave.
We can get through this.
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're going to make it.
We both know that isn't true.
Help me.
Listen to me.
You saved my life once.
Now I want you to save yourself.
Gray, no. Please?
Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.
Don't leave me, Gray.
You've been trying to tell me that death isn't the end.
Don't back out on me now that I finally believe.
I love you.
Oh, it's warm.
Tanya, Fievel?
Will you stop that twirling, twirling?
Uh, no. No more.
That's it. Time for bed. Come.
But, Mama, it's Hanukkah!
For you, every night is Hanukkah.
Papa, enough already.
They'll never get to sleep.
All right. All right.
Presents.
What about presents?
Presents? What presents?
Oh, Papa.
Just a joke.
For Tanya, a new babushka.
Happy Hanukkah.
Oh, Papa. Thank you.
You have only one parent?
Thank you, Mama.
Hmm.
And for you, Fievel, a new hat.
And not just any hat.
A new hat that has been in the family for three generations.
It belonged to me, my father, and my father's father, and now, it belongs to you.
Happy Hanukkah.
It's too big!
You'll grow.
Ah, did I ever tell you about the Giant Mouse of Minsk?
No.
No.
Was it anything like the mouse with the long hair that the prince climbed up?
No. This mouse, the Mouse of Minsk, was tall as a tree.
His tail was a mile long.
Really?
Really.
He was so big, he frightened all the cats.
Shh!
Don't say that word.
Talk about something else.
America.
Another fairy tale.
America.
What a place!
What a place!
What a place!
In America, there are mouse holes in every wall.
Who says?
Everyone!
In America, there are bread crumbs on every floor!
You're talking nonsense.
In America, you can say anything you want.
But most important...
And this I know for fact, in America, there are no cats.
Shh. They'll hear you.
How could they hear us?
There, you see?
The Cossacks! The Cossacks!
Don't cry, Yasha.
I'll scare them away.
Fievel, you'll get hurt!
Go away!
Go away, cats! Go away!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Fievel, angel, are you all right?
Yes, Mama.
Then never do that again!
Mama, look.
In America, there are no cats.
Look, Papa, water.
Is it the ocean?
Yes. Keep walking.
Look, Papa, smoke!
Is the boat on fire?
No. No. Keep walking!
Look, Papa, birds!
Are they seagulls?
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
I just wanted to see.
Fievel, this is the last time I take you to America.
Bye-bye!
Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Ooh, auf Wiedersehen!
You know I got a cousin in America.
Ah!
You and everybody else.
Huh?
Are we there yet?
Not yet. Soon.
How soon?
Soon.
Maybe we should have stayed in Russia.
We'll be all right.
As long as we're together, we'll be all right.
Ah, so, Mr. Curious, you've discovered the herring.
Herring?
I thought they were fish.
But, Fievel, herring are fish.
Really?
Certainly.
In the ocean, there are all kinds of fish, and herring is one of them.
All kinds?
Yes. Tiny fishes, not so tiny fishes, fishes as big as this boat.
Wow!
Let's go up and see the fish!
Not now.
Your mama's worried.
Come back, Fievel.
Wait!
Oh, what am I going to do with you?
You stay closer to home!
Don't you go running off again!
Mama!
Ah, so we return, hmm?
We saw some fish!
Fish?
Lucky you didn't see some cats.
Cats!
Cats!
Oh!
I didn't see any cats.
Whew.
Won't it be nice to get to America where we don't have to worry about cats anymore?

Now they are coming by bottle.
Uh, where is your papa?
Your maman, eh?
I don't know. They were on the boat to America.
Ah! Then you are in luck, my little immigrant.
This is America!
America.
I thought it was bigger.
Oh, it is bigger.
All of that is also America.
Wow!
This is just an island at the doorway where I, Henri le pigeon, am putting up my
Statue of Liberty!
I know, my little immigrant, you want to find your family, and you will.
But how?
It's so far away, and it's so big!
I'll never find them anyway.
But did you say,
"Never"?
So young, and you have lost hope.
Ah, this is America, the place to find hope!
If you give up, you will never find your family.

Good luck!
Good-bye!
Come on, keep it moving, keep it moving.
All right.
Hurry, hurry!
Yes, sir! Step off the boat and into prosperity!
Welcome, greenhorns!
This is America!
Today's special, the Brooklyn
Bridge, just a dollar!
Golly, the Brooklyn Bridge!
Ticket to Chicago!
Used only once!
Gee whiz!
Only once, Ma.
Apple, apple?
Get my apple while it lasts.
Hurry, it's going fast!
I'll take one!
Eighteen, 19, 20, 21.
Would you please put out that filthy thing?
I'm suffocating down here.
You don't like it?
Hey, you know you're not the only cockroach in New York City.
There are millions of roaches who'd give their left feet to work for Warren T. Rat.
Good. Fire me!
I'm fed up with that filthy smoke...
Hey!
And this pocket!
I've seen kitchen stoves cleaner than this place.
Hey, come on.
Look at my suit.
All right, all right, Digit.
All right.
Hey, how much money did we make today?
Oh.
Oh, well. Well, let's see.
Uh, seven, nine, four, six, carry one, drop two.
Uh, take five, five down, seven up, 98.6...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And two plus two is 22.
What did we make?
What's the boodle?
Oh, so far, we have collected $89 and...
And 13 cents. Uh-oh.
And we'll get another 17 from Moe.
Uh, that's 50 cents less than yesterday.
What?
Fifty cents!
I hate to lose money.
Mmm. Where can I pick up an extra 50 cents?
Bye!
Au revoir, my little immigrant!
Huh?
Hmm. Hey, boss, a kid.
Hmm. You know, Moe can always use an extra kid at 50 cents a day.
Yeah.
Very interesting.
Ahem! Well, well, well!
Rat's the name, Warren T. Rat.
What can I do you for, kid?
I'm looking for my family.
Hey, you come to the right fellow, kid.
I know exactly where they are.
Come with me.
But Henri said I'd find them here!
Have it your way, kid.
But remember what Shakespeare said.
And I quote.
"Opportunity knocks but..."
Uh... But, uh...
Psst! Once!
"But... But once!
"Taken at the tide, t'will lead to fortune.
"If denied, t'will never return."
Do you really know where my family is?
Trust me. Hey, trust me.
Mama, I keep having this feeling that Fievel's alive.
Tanya, it will go away.
After a while, it will go away.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't break a gut there.
"O! Pardon me,
"thou bleeding piece of earth,
"That I am meek and gentle with these butchers."
This is where they are.
Papa!
Not bad, huh, Moe?
A new worker.
What about my family?
You don't need a family, kid.
You got a job here!
Just send me his salary, will you?
And where do you think you're going?
You're mine! Now get to work!
You! What are you looking at?
Back to work!
I want to get out of here.
You and me both.
I have to find my family.
Oh, shut up! Go to sleep.
Pipe down.
Oh, be quiet!
I wish we had that mouse with the long hair.
She could drop her hair out the window, and we can all climb down.
Sure. Out the window.
Oh, fairy tales!
Wait a minute!
This kid may have something.
Tony Toponi's the name.
Put it there. Well, uh...
Fievel.
Fievel Mousekewitz.
Fievel!
Ooh, that name's got to go!
Hey, I'll tell you what...
Fillie!
Fillie?
Yeah!
Fits you perfect!
Hey, Fillie.
You got any idea where your family is?
Fillie!
Fillie Mousekewitz!

What am I going to do with you?
Come on, come little ones, eat.
Don't gobble so.
Back! Back! Mine!
Papa.
Papa.
Papa!
Grand and Hester streets!
Here, Papa. Here I am.
Papa?
Are you there?
Oh, my word! A mouse!
What's going on up there?
Hey! Shut up out there!
What's going on up there?
Hey, Fillie!
I've been looking all over for you.
Pardon the expression, but you look like something the cat dragged in, you know?
Hey, you all right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Listen, you go running off like that and you're gonna get yourself seriously lost.
Stick with me, okay?
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
What, we engaged or something?
Why can't we try to find Fievel, Papa?
Oh.
Just try!
I know, Papa.
Play your violin.
Play Fievel's song.
Oy, Tanya.
Maybe he'll hear it.
You can't find what's not there.
Okay, okay.
I got it all figured out.
We'll start looking for your family over in...
This is America.
Don't be afraid.
Are you going to let those cats push you around?
Tony? Hey, Tony, where you going?
I ask you this.
Are we going to stand by and let cats wreck our homes, our businesses and our lives?
If we all got together, we could do something about the cats!
Yeah. We should all get together.
This is America.
We have free speech.
You can say "cat" here.
Cat, cat, cat!
And double cat!
Shh! Not so loud.
Shh.
Please, not that word.
Wait a minute. Come back!
Where are you going?
Oh.
So, if we all got together, we could do something about the...
Cats.
Yeah.
Cat...
Ca...
Cat.
Tony?
Tony, what's wrong with you?
But there are no cats in America.
That does it.
I'm getting out of here!
Mmm-hmm, me too.
What are you all afraid of?
Cats, cats, cats, cats.
Papa told me.
Everyone knows it.
There are no cats.
Hey, you all right?
I mean, you ain't hurt or nothing, are you?
No. No, I'm okay.
Thank you.
No, really, I'm all right.
Really, I am.
How about you?
Nah!
Who do those cats think they are?
I'll show them a thing or two next time.
Hey, where's Fillie?
Fillie? Who's Fillie?
Oh, I gotta find him.
He's just a kid.
Fillie!
Tony!
Whoa!
Phew! Hmm. Some scrap, huh?
There are cats here.
Wait till I tell Papa!
If I find him.
You see, he's looking for his family.
Aw, the poor darling.
Wait a minute!
Honest John, at Tammany Hall.
He'll know where your family is.
He will?
Tony, he knows every mouse in the city!
Ha! Told you to stick with me, yeah?
Come on.
Oh!
Well, Mr. There Are
No Whats in America?
Mmm?
Cats.
It's me third wake today, and I'm not finished.
We've got to do something about them cats.
Besides paying Warren T. Rat for no protection.
Oh, oh, poor lad.
So young.
He never had a chance to vote.
Well, he'll vote from now on.
I'll see to that.
Honest John.
It's Gussie Mausheimer!
Oh.
Ooh-whee, the richest and most powerful mouse in New York.
What's she doing slumming in this part of town?
There's a dead mouse on that table.
It's an Irish custom, Gussie.
The cats got him today.
Precisely why I am here to see you.
Would you care for a wee drop of the creature?
Today was the worst ever.
Those cats are killing everyone!
They don't even know the difference between rich and poor.
The wretches!
Oh, shameful!
As you know,
I have dedicated my life to helping those less fortunate than myself.
Uh, that's everyone.
And now I want you to help me.
We must have a wawwy.
A wawwy? What's a wawwy?
You know, a wawwy.
A large gathering of mice for a reason.
Oh, a rally!
That's what I said, a wawwy.
Tomorrow at Mausheimer Park, we will all decide what to do.
I'll bring the uptown mice and you bring the mice from downtown.
Madam, you can count on Honest John.
At last, we're all getting together about the cats.
Bridget.
Oh, Fillie.
Honest John, he's lost his family.
By any chance, do you know the Mousekewitzes?
Oh, hmm.
Are they registered to vote?
They just got off the boat.
Oh.
Sorry, don't know them yet.
That's my mother and father.
The cats got them two years ago November.
Now, don't you worry.
Yours are all right.
And they're out there somewhere.
Now.
Get some sleep.

Attention, please!
You all know why we are here.
We have got to do something about these cats.
Not so loud! They'll hear you!
So?
Let them hear me.
You can talk!
You're rich!
Money is not everything.
I know, because I have money and I have everything,
but what are they worth without freedom?
Hear, hear!
Yeah! Right!
Why did we come to America?
For freedom!
Why are they building that statue?
What does it stand for?
Freedom!
So what do we want?
Freedom!
Right!
Freedom from cats.
And because this is America, we can do something about them!
What do we do?
Papa, I can't see.
They're bigger than we are!
Not if we all work together.
What are you afraid of?
Are we men, or are we mice?
Mice!
Mice, indeed, and proud of it!
So, what are we going to do about those cats?
Well?
Any ideas?
Ahem.
Oh, yes, well, I...
Oh, dear.
I have an idea.
Yes?
Hmm.
What did he say?
Uh, he, he said, uh...
Uh-huh.
Hmm...
Ohh.
Yes. Cute little fellow.
Wait a minute.
I think this little fellow has got something here.
We have a plan!
Oh, Papa.
She's in the way again!
Look out below!
Shh!
We have a plan!
E pluribus unum!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to thank you so much for your participation.
And I want to close by saying, that a vote for Honest John is a vote for freedom!
Freedom is what it is!
And thank you again, one and all!
Holy spumoni!
We should have been at the pier an hour ago!
The pier?
That's a scary place!
I promised Bridget we'd be on time.
Wait for me! Wait!
Geez Louise, am I in the doghouse!
Pick 'em up!
Tell me what time it was, huh?
But, Tony, I can't tell time!
Tony, slow down! Wait!
Wait!
Papa?
Tony!
Papa!
I'm coming, Papa!
Papa?
All right, ante up, boys.
Hey, no cheating.
Hmm.
Ooh! I got it! I got it!
I got it!
Rummy!
Tiger, for the hundredth time, we're playing poker.
I knew that. I knew that.
But who can concentrate with all that, you know, noise?
Hey, Tiger.
When the boss plays, it's culture.
Sure, culture.
I think it sounds, uh, melodious.
"If music be the food of love,
"play on, McDuff, play on."
Oh, I don't know which is worse, the music or the Shakespeare.
Rats! This nose, this nose here keeps getting in the way!
You... You could stop playing.
That's funny.
I've never known a cockroach with good taste.
But, I've known plenty that taste...
Good.
Play, play, play!
Ahem. Hmm.
Warren T!
You!
You're not a rat!
You're a cat!
How did you get in here?
Come here, you little...
Gentlemen, cat's out of the bag!
Get me that mouse!
Let me at him.
I mean, let me at him.
I'll kill him! Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
You just stepped on my tail!
Come here, you little runt!
Get him!
Get him!
Once more.
There is the boat.
The boat whistle blows at 6:00 in the morning, and that is when we must release the secret weapon!
So, the cats must be here at 6:00 on the dot, not a moment before or after.
Now, when you go to get the cats, what do you do to make them come here?
Nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah.
Right!
Now get some sleep.
We have a long day ahead.
No, no, no.
Boss, it was not me.
I promise, that wasn't me.
Wake up.
Uh, wake up.
Jake! Wake up.
You're up.
Uh, go get some sleep, Jake.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Rest, sleep.
On your guard, Tiger!
Don't make any funny moves.
'Cause I'm crafty, and I'm quick.
I have the instinct of a cat.
What am I saying?
I am a cat!
Oh, hey, now don't start that.
I didn't mean to scare you that much, really.
It's okay, little buddy.
Hey, I'm your friend.
Aw, come on.
Be happy.
Aw.
Oh, come on.
What are you crying for?
I can't get out of here and I have to, so I can find my family.
You lost your family?
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, no.
That's terrible.
You know, I lost my family, too.
Years ago, I mean.
Eight brothers...
Ten sisters...
Three fathers...
Don't cry.
You'll find them.
Do you really think so?
Gee, you're nice.
Um, my name is Tiger.
What's yours?
Fievel, Fievel Mousekewitz.
Oh, dear.
Listen. I like mice.
Oh, no, not like that.
I mean, I don't eat red meat at all.
I'm a vegetarian.
That's right.
Oh, a little fish now and then.
But what I really like is some nice... Shh...
Broccoli.
You know, I thought all cats were supposed to be mean.
Mean? Ha!
I am mean!
Then... And...
Aw, what's the use?
I like butterflies with big golden wings and blue and green tips.
Me, too!
Yeah? Ha.
I like Swiss cheese ice cream.
Me, too! Me, too!
You too, too? Hmm.
Wait a minute.
What's your favorite book?
Um, The Brothers Karamazov.
The Brothers...

Oh, stop it! Uh! Oh!
Tiger, how did he get away?
He overpowered me.
You're fired.
Good. I'm glad.
I never liked you, and besides, your music stinks.
Tony! Help!
Help! Cats!
Tony, Bridget, help!
Cats!
It's the cats!
Help!
Oh, they're early!
Wake up! Everybody, wake up!
Cats!
Help!
Wake up! The cats are here!
Wake up!
Cats!
The cats!
Release the secret weapon!
What? Release the... Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! No, no!
Wait for the boat whistle!
Hold your fire.
It's that rat, Warren T.
He's not a rat.
He's a cat.
He's their boss.
Pay no attention to that little mouse.
Just throw down all your money and that kid.
And I will personally convince these cats to leave you alone.
You're wrecking the plan!
It's not supposed to happen this way!
Just throw down that kid!
Oh. yeah?
Bull's eye!
Disregard the nose.
What's in a nose?
A nose by any other name would smell as sweet...
Great whiskers, it's a cat!
He's a cat!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.
Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?
Release the secret...
No, no!
Hey, easy, easy!
All right. Then, I take it we can't do business.
Warren, you're through.
Washed up, ruined!
You'll never get another cent from any mouse, anywhere.
Eh? We'll see about that.
Just wait, you little rat.
Just wait.
Adiós!
Fire!

Oh, you're right.
Yay!
Head for the pier!

Whoa!

Ladies and gentlemen, credit where it's due.
We owe it all to Fillie and his Mouse of Minsk!
♪ Now there are no cats in America... ♪
Fillie! Who's Fillie?
Someday,
Gussie Mausheimer, someday!
And you, too, Mousekewitz.
All of you! I hate mice!
I'm having a heart attack here.
Oh, don't worry, gentlemen. Don't worry.
There are plenty of mice in Hong Kong.
Oh, my! I'll have to learn to calculate in Chinese.
Hmm. Let me see, uh.
Hey, I wonder how you say "trust me" in Chinese.

Papa, listen.

Ah, so what? Someone is calling a Fillie Mousekewitz.
They changed my name to Tilly.
Maybe they changed Fievel's name to Fillie.
Come on, Papa. Just got to see.
Wait!
Stop! Stop!
Hurry. Hurry!

Fillie!
Wait!

You are calling for a Fillie Mousekewitz, right?
Here, tell my daughter his name is Fillie and not Fievel.
His name is Fillie.
You see?
And Fievel.
And Fievel?
Papa.
No, no, no, there are many Fievel
Mousekewitzes in New York.
Maybe thousands.
It could still be another Fievel Mousekewitz.
No, Papa.
Look.
Get a load of this, huh.
Hey, kid, you're sleeping in my place.
Huh?
Hey, give me that!
Got any food on you?
Hey, what's your story?
I've been looking for my family.
Hey, fellows, he's looking for his family.
He's looking for his family!
I stopped that a long time ago.
At least you know who they are.
Yeah!
Why are you looking for them?
They should be looking for you.
They don't care.
Forget them.
You're right, they don't care!
And if they did, they would have found me.
Well, if they don't care,
I don't care!
I don't care if I never see them again.
Yeah, you're nothing.
You're junk, you're trash.
Here.
Make yourself a bed.
I'll never find them again anyway.
Never
This is my home now.

Hey, Fillie Mousekewitz!
I never dreamt this morning
I would be riding a feline.

What's come over me?
I am hugging a cat.
I've never been so happy in my life.
I have friends, lots of little tiny friends.
Oh, Tony, isn't it grand?
Say, I don't hear no one thanking me here.
Oh!
Fievel, I knew you were alive. I knew it!
Oh, my little boy back from the dead.
America. Hmm.
What a place.
My Fievel.
I thought I would never see you again.
Never say never, Papa.
Oh!
Oh! I nearly forgot.
Here, Fievel, your hat.
Your hat... It fits.
My son.
Now, you are a mouse.
My statue is finished.
Wait till you see her.
She is beautiful.
Magnifique.
Mama, look, don't be afraid to open your eyes.
Look what you're missing.
You're missing everything.
Papa, when we land, I'll look.
Oh! Oh! Oh!

Oh, thanks, fellas.
I appreciate you coming back for me.

[ Master Of Ceremonies ]
On the pages ofAmerican folklore, a legion ofmighty men have left the symbols oftheir greatness,
There was Paul Bunyan ´s ax;
John Henry´s hammer;
Davy Crockett´s rifle; and then, quite unexpectedly, one comes upon a tin pot hat, a bag ofapple seed,,, and a holy book,
And strangely enough, these are the symbols of one ofthe mightiest men ofall--
John Chapman, a real-life pioneer,
With the passingyears, however, reality has given way to legend, until today we know this remarkable man simply as Johnny Appleseed,
This is his story, told by an old settler who knewJohnny well,
Listen,
[ Old Settler Narrating ] Well, sir, every time I see an apple blossom sky,,,
I think ofJohnny Appleseed,
´cause, of course, them clouds up thar, they ain ´t really clouds at all,
No, sir,
Why, shucks, there wouldn ´t be no apple blossom sky,,, ifit weren ´t for the fact thatJohnny--
But now, hold on here, Guess I´d better start back to the beginnin ´,
That´s when Johnny lived on a farm near Pittsburgh town,
The year was 1 806, or maybe there around,
Now,just to look at him you´d sayJohnny Appleseed never would make a pioneer,
- ## [ Whistl i ng ]
- He was such a sawed-off, scrawny little fella,
´Course that didn´t faze Johnny none,
Shucks, he had his apple trees and the morning sun and the evening breeze,
- ## [ Conti nues Whistl i ng ]
- [ Twitteri ng ]
# The Lord is good to me #
# And so I thank the Lord #
# For givin´ me the things I need #
# The sun and rain and an apple seed #
#Yes,  He´s been good to me #
## [ Continues Whistling ]
# I owe the Lord so much #
# For everything I see #
# I´m certain ifitweren´t for Him #
#There´d be no apples on this limb #
# He´s been goodto me#
# Oh,  here am I ´neath the blue,  blue sky #
- # A-doin´ as I please #
- [Twittering ]
#Singin´ with myfeathered friends #
- [ Buzzing ]
- # Hummin´ with the bees #
# I wake up every day #
# As happy as can be #
# Because I know that with His care #
# My apple trees theywill still be there #
# Oh,  the Lord is good to me #
## [ Continues Whistling ]
[ OldSettler]
Workin´, singin´, carefree andgay,
That´s howJohnny spent each day, attendin´ to his apple trees,
But lately littleJohnny here would feel a stirrin´in the air--

PoorJohnny,
He weren´t no pioneer, and he knowed it,
It was alljust pretend, and them folks goin´ west to build this nation,,, sure made pickin´apples look like a plumb useless occupation,
- ## [ Fades ]
- Well, sir, that´s when a miracle happened,
""Well, what´s holdin ´ya,Johnny?, "" says a voice,
""Go on, Go on out west, ifthat´s your choice, ""
Well, sir, it was an angel,
Johnny´s own private guardian angel,
Might look mighty queersome to you and me, but, you know, that´s just the way
John figured he ´d be,
Wel l,  speak up,  boy.
Don´t stand there gawki n´.
U nlock your jaw and get to talkin´.
Y-Y-Yes,  sir--
Yes,  sir!.
Why don´t I go west?.
´Cause I ain´t got the muscle... nor the breadth ofchest,
Out tharit´s the strong men who survive, and I´m about the puniest feller alive.
Shame to ya, Johnny.
You got faith and courage and a level head.
But,  shucks, you see,  sir, all I know is... apple trees.
And what´s wrong with apples, ifyou please?.
Ain´t they ´bout the finest fruit in all the land?.
Why,  shoot,  man, they take the cake.
Just think, Johnny, of all the things that apples make.
There´s,  uh, apple pickles.
# Oh-so-tastyapple tarts andapple pastry#
# Apple dumplings
Not to mention-- #
- Applesauce?.
- Yes!
# And there´s apple fritters light as thistle #
# And for folks to wet their whistle #
[ Together ]
# Tangy apple cider in a glass #
Stew ´em,  fry ´em, boil ´em,  bake ´em.
- Apple pie and apple cake ´em.
- Yep!
# You can cook ´em any way#
# There´s apple this andapple that#
#The recipes´d fill yer hat #
#Why,  I could carry on like this all day #
# So,  packyer stuff and git a-goin´ #
# Git them apple trees a-growin´ #
#There´s a lot ofwork out there to do #
[ Together]
#There´s a lot ofwork to do #
- Yes,  sir!.
- ## [ Whistling ]
I mean,  no,  sir.
Yousee, sir, I ain´t got the traps, ain´t got the gear,,, ornone ofthe things
I´ll need out there,
You ain´t got the--
Dadgum it,  boy, 
I´m ashamed ofyou.
You got the stuff to see you through.
Why,you got all the seedsyou´re needin´, and for pretty darn good readin´...
#There ain´t nothin´ finer than your book #
Here´s a mighty handy bonnet.
Even got a handle on it.
#Turn it upside-down and you can cook#
# So,  come on,  son and git a-goin´ #
# Git them apple trees a-growin´ #
[ Together] #There´s a lot ofwork out there to do #
# Oh,  there´s a lot ofwork to do ##
[OldSettler]
Well, sir, that´s howit all began,
That´s howJohnny, all alone, set out to meet the great unknown,
´Twas a mighty big and fearsome place,,, for a man to face,
A little man, and all alone, without no knife, without no gun,
And though the forest is dark and wide,,, with fearsome critters on every side,
Johnnyjust kept walkin ´ on,
Walked until at last he found a little spot of open ground,,, with fertile soil and warmsome breeze, a likely place for apple trees,
Now, the varmints here, they couldn ´t know,,, ifJohn was friend orJohn was foe, so some took off in sudden flight,,, and some got set to claw and bite,
But ifJohnny seen ´em he paid no heed,
Just got busy a-plantin´apple seeds,
## [ Whistl i ng ]
## [ Conti nues ]
Now, them varmints come from everywhere,,, to watch that man a-diggin´ there,
Didn´t like what they was seein´,
Didn´t trust no human bein´,
## [ Conti nues ]
Yep, that ornery human had to go,
But who was a-gonna tell him so?,
Well, not a soul could answer that,,, till here come along a black-and-white cat,
Now, he weren´t too bright, but he didn´t much care,
He knowed he had a certain ai r... about him,
## [ Whistling Continues ]
[ Sniffi ng ]
## [ Continues ]
Well, sir, that done it,
The critters ne´er seed the beat ofthat, the likes ofa human a-likin´ that cat,
Why, shucks, this little man had went and busted every precedent,
He was the very first to come,,, without no knife, without no gun,
And so it was, from that time on, every last livin ´ varmint was a friend to John,
- ## [ Conti nues ]
- They surely was,
# The Lord is good to me #
# And so I thank the Lord #
# For givin´me the things I need#
# The sun and rain and an apple seed#
# Yes, He´s been good to me ##
Well, as time went byJohnny kept right on a-plantin´his apple trees,,, and makin´ friends everywhere, and his best friends was the pioneers,,, for, of course,John was plantin´more than an apple tree,
He was plantin´his own boundless faith and courage too, and that give folks new heart, new hope in the job they had to do,
As more and more pioneers come to push back the forest, the kindly deeds oflittle Johnny Appleseed,,, spread throughout the land, and more ´n once, with a good old-fashionedjubilee, folks would honorJohnny Appleseed and the fruit ofthe apple tree,

[ Old Settler] Yup,Johnny did bring folks a heap ofhappiness,
But, shucks, he weren´t lookin´ for thanks,
Didn´t have time fer it,
He knowed a man can´t take no rest,,, ifhe aims to plant the whole darn wilderness in apple trees,
And so it was-- for more´n 40 year,,,
John walked and planted that old frontier,
[ Thunderclap ]
Yes, sir, 40 years of walkin ´ and plantin ´,
And in that space oftwoscore year,,, this little man, he throwed his shadow clear across the land, across 1 00, 000 miles square,
And in that shadow everywhere,,, you´ll find he left his blessin ´s three:
[ Chorus ]
# Love and faith #
# And the apple tree #

´Cause it´s like I said, ifyou´ll recall:.
Them clouds ain´t really clouds at all,
They´re apple blossoms, ifyou please, from John ´s heavenly orchard ofapple trees,

There´s poetry in trees, they say, and, well, one day a poet found it,
Then a music master wove around it,,, melody,
An artist touched it, gave it form in colors rich and warm,
And now we bring to you these three:. poem, picture, melody,
A simple tribute to a tree,
[ Chorus ]
# I think that I shall never see #
# A poem lovely as a tree #
# A tree whose hungry mouth #
# Is pressed#
# Against the earth ´s sweet flowing #
# Breast #
# A tree that looks #
# At God#
# All day #
# And lifts her leafy arms #
# To pray #

# A nest ofrobins in her hair #

[Master OfCeremonies ] Here´s a tall tale straight from the chuck wagon, just the way the old-timers used to tell ´em,
Accordin´ to them,
Pecos Bill was the roughest, toughest, rootin ´-est, tootin ´-est shootin ´-est cowpoke that ever lived,
Well, any story about ol´ Pecos is bound to be right strong medicine, so maybe it´s best to sashay into it kinda gentle-like,

Uncle Roy.
- Yes,  honey?.
- What makes the wolves howl like that?.
Wolves?. Ha!
Those are coyotes.
-Aren´t they, Roy?
- Yep,  they´re coyotes. Bobby´s right.
- They always howl when the moon is bright.
- Why?.
Well, that´s quite a story,
- Cowboys in it?.
- Yes, sirree,
- I njuns too?.
- Well,  could throw in maybe two or three.
But mostly this story is about Pecos Bill.
- Pecos Bill?. Who´s he?.
-## [ Guitar: Sharp Strum ]
- What?. Never heard of Pecos Bill?.
- Imagine that.
Why,  I thought everybody knowed Pecos.
Why,  Bobby, 
I´m surprised at you.
Bill was the world´s greatest buckaroo.
# He was the roughest, toughest critter
Never known to be a quitter #
# ´Cause he never had no fear for man nor beast #
- Yep,  that there Pecos Bill was--
- [ Whinnying ]
Easy,  Trigger.
I´m not forgettin´ Bill´s horse.
Why,  shucks, 
I couldn´t forget Widowmaker.
- Widowmaker?.
- [ Laughs ] That´s a funny name.
But that horse earnedit just the same,
- He was a killer.
- Dynamite on the hoof.
Yep,  Widowmaker was Bill´s best pal, until along came that beautiful prairie gal.
[ Whinnying ]
- Aw,  shucks. A woman in the story.
- But what a woman.
# She was fresh as the dew#
# On a prairie rose #
# A true thoroughbred #
# From her head to her toes #
#That there was Slewfoot Sue #
# Sweet Sue #
Slewfoot Sue. Huh!
I´d rather hear about the coyotes.
Yes,  Uncle Roy, you started to say--
Why the coyotes howl at the moon that way?.
You´re right,  honey, but it all fits together.
Can´t tell one without the other, because the story of Bill and that Slewfoot gal... is the story of coyotes and why they howl.
I´m gettin´ down to the details right now.
Now,  here on the map ofthe old U.S., completely surrounded bywilderness,  lies Texas.
-[Cowboy] Amen,
- ´Course,  there´s some other states scattered around.
- Yeah, like Wyoming,
- Milwaukee,
-And Long Island Sound,
- Right,
[Roy Rogers ]
Down Texas way a river flows,
Where it comes from, nobody knows,
Where it´s a-goin´ don´t no one care,
Just doggone glad it´s a-leavin´ there,
- That there´s the Pecos River,
- She was pure alkali,
Just naturally mean water,
Why, the buzzards won ´t even touch it,
-## [ Whistling ]
- Into this fertile garden spot,,, once there come a prairie cart,
- [ Shouti ng,  Chatteri ng ]
- There was Ma and Pa and 1 6 brats, four hound dogs--
[ Cowboy ]
Yeah, and a couple of cats,
[ Roy Rogers ]All a-goin´ west, lookin´ for elbow room,
Sure could use some ofthe same,
Crossin´ the Pecos River bed, somethin´ fell out and lit on his head,
Folks didn´t even know he was gone,
Ol´ wagon just kept a-rollin´along,
Yep, it was Bill,
Poor little critter,
Homeless as a poker chip,
# ´Long came night and a prairie moon #
# Old Ma Coyote a-hurryin ´ home #
# She was due for a shock at herjourney´s end#
# Fer the stork had delivered a dividend#
Plumb unusual!
Yep,
´Tain´t never happened before,
-Probably one ofthem newfangled models,
-[ Sniffi ng ]
# Bill looked up and then he grinned#
Shucks!
# Ma´s ol´heart just plumb caved in #
# Bill seen right off that he needn´t fear #
# He´d staked himself a claim right here #
Headed straight for that old chuck wagon,
Yep, ol´ Bill was hungrier than a woodpecker with a headache,
And so it follered as a natural fact,,,
- that Bill growed up with that coyote pack,
- [ Growls ]
He soon become the main top hand,,, in a way they all could understand,
[ Yel I i ng ]
But little Bill, he couldn´t rest,,, till he´d proved hisself the A- 1 best,
So he studied the other varmints too, then showed ´em all a trick or two,
Outloped the antelope,
Outjumped the jackrabbit,
[ Rattl i ng ]
[ H issi ng ]
[ Yel I i ng ]
Yeah, Bill even outhissed the rattlesnake,
# Then one day #
# ´Cross the burnin´sand#
# A stranger come #
# To the Pecos land#
# The usual committee #
# Was there today #
# To welcome their guest #
-# In #
- [ Foal Whi nnyi ng ]
# The usual way #
Now, 50 to 1 weren´t no fair fight, but one plus Bill made itjust about right,
[ Yel I i ng ]
Well, it was the beginning ofa beautiful friendship,
From that time on them two stuck together,,,
Iike warts on a toad, like birds ofa feather,
When Bill growed up, it was natural, of course-- he ´d choose a career to suit him and his horse,
Yep, Bill become a rootin ´, tootin ´ cowboy,
Ya-hoooo!
Ya-hoooo!
# Ohhhh #
# Pecos Bill was quite a cowboy down in Texas #
[ Gunshots ]
# And the western superman to say the least #
# He was the roughest toughest critter #
# Never known to be a quitter #
# ´Cause he never had no fear ofman nor beast #
# So yippee-i-yay

- # While reclinin´ on a cloud high over Texas #

# So yippee-i-yay
I-yay #
# Yippee-i-ohh #
- Yep, them was happy days fer Bill and that hoss,
- [ Gunshots ]
Looked like nothin´ could ever come between ´em,
Then it happened,
Now, Bill was happy that fateful day, a-killin´some time in his carefree way, inventin´a one-man rodeo,,, a-buttin´heads with the buffalo,
Poor Bill,
Yeah, happy as a hog in a turnip patch,
And then old man Fate started dealin´ from the bottom ofthe deck, for down the stream come Slewfoot Sue,,, with all her charms revealed to view,
Looked like somethin´ from out´n a dream-- first female woman
Bill´s ever seen,
## [ WolfWhistle ]
- She was strange,
- Unusual,
Yeah, but powerful stimulatin´,
Like a slug ofrye on an empty stomach,
# Give ´im a right peculiar feelin´#
# Set his senses plumb to reelin´#
-# With a poundin´sound inside his ears #
- [ Stampeding Hoofbeats ]
# Like the gallopin´hooves ofa thousand steers #
# Inside his chest was a-seethin´and churnin´#
# His blood was a-boilin´
His brain was a-burnin´#
# A-burnin´ with the fires that could only be cooled#
# In the beckoning depths #
# Oftwo blue, limpid pools #
Yep, I ´amour had come to Pecos Bill,
[ Barki ng,  Howl i ng ]
Yahoo!
Widowmaker was plumb puzzled,
Looked like trouble to him, and he sure was right,
Bill was busy inventin´ courtin´, western-style,
# He arranged for the moon #
# To rise just right #
# And flood the land#
# With a silvery light #
# Ordered the stars #
# In heaven above #
# To form a token #
# Ofundying love #
# Then, ´cross the sky #
# In words offire #
# Bill told sweet Sue #
# Ofhis own heart´s #
# Desire #
# Sweet Sue #
# I love #
- [ Kissi ng Sound ]
-# You ##
And so Sue named the wedding day, but there was a price
Bill had to pay,
Sue wanted a bustle-- the finest, of course-- and she aimed to be wedded a-ridin´ Bill´s horse,
Well, Sue got her bustle and it sure was classy,
Put the finishin ´ touch on that sweet gal´s chassis,
Why, that there happy, blushin ´ bride,,, was a-bustin ´ out with girlish pride,
## [ Wolf Whistles ]
But Bill had promised Slewfoot Sue a ride on Widowmaker too,
[ Gul p ]
- Would that horse be willin´ to let Sue ride?
- [ Whinnying ]
Well, here comes the answer-- fit to be tied,
Widowmaker was plumb irritated,
But it didn ´t bother Sue none,
She walked right up to that critter´s side,
Her gentle hand touched his bristlin ´ hide,
Her foot found the stirrup, With a flick ofher bustle, Sue was aboard,
- And sought for the tussle,
- [ Yawns ]
The proceedin ´s begun to commence,,, forthwith,
[ Widowmaker Whi nnyi ng ]
No doubt about it.
That there Sue was a regular female buckaroo.
[ Whinnying Continues ]
And then, that bustle--
Underneath them frills and flounces,
Sue was developin´ plenty ofbounces,
Got to be more´n that gal could handle, and Sue took off like a Roman candle,
That devilish contraption ofsteel and wire,,, kept bouncin´ that poor gal higher and higher,
Soon it was plain to the multitude,,, that Sue was a-gainin´altitude,
Sure looked like she was a goner,
But no,
Here come a ray ofhope,
Look! I t were Bi I l and his trusty rope.
He´d durn soon put a stop to this,
- Shucks, Bill was never knowed to miss,
- [ Crash ]
Bill was calm, confident,
He built his loop with careless ease,
He judged his distance, tested the breeze,
Then a whirl and a twirl and a twist ofthe wrist,
He let ´er go,,, but the champeen missed,
How it come to happen, nobody could ever figure out,
## [ Whistl i ng ]
She was offagain on her heavenly flight,
Up, up she went, clean out ofsight, till far into space this unfortunate maid,,, finally come to the moon, and that´s where she stayed,
In the state ofTexas,
U,S,A,,
Iife still goes on in the same old way,,, and the Pecos River still flows on, but the greatest cowboy on Earth,,, is gone,
Yeah, Bill went back to the coyotes, but he never forgot Sue,
And every night, when the moon ris´high, he´d lift his voice in mournful cry,
- [ Howl i ng ]
- Bewailin´ the fate ofhis lady fair, his long lost love in the sky up there,
- [ Howling Continues ]
- So painful was his griefto see, the varmints joined in out ofsympathy,
And that´s how come, to this very day, coyotes howl at the moon that way,
- # Move along #

I'm stuck.
Get back!
Mr. Tweedy!
What is that chicken doing outside the fence?
I don't know, luv.
- Just deal with it. Now!
I'll teach you to make a fool out of me.
Let that be a lesson to you!
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!
Morning, Ginger.
Back from holiday?
- I wasn't on holiday.
I was in solitary confinement.
It's nice to get a bit of time to yourself, isn't it?
Roll call!
Come along. You'll be late for parade.
Pip, pip. Quick march.
Left right...
Come on, smarten up!
Discipline! Order!
Back in my RAF days, when an officer called for a scramble, you'd hop in the old crate and chocks away!
Keep over, you old fool.
They just want to count us.
How dare you talk back to a senior ranking officer!
Back in my RAF days...
- Fowler, they're coming.
Right, right!
There'll be a reprimand, lad.
You're grounded.
Attention!
Welcome back, hen.
Is there a new plan?
We've already tried going under.
Over. Right.
How's the egg count?
- I laid 5 eggs today.
Well chuffed with that, I was.
Oh no.
Why didn't you give her some of yours?
- She didn't tell me.
She didn't tell anyone.
Is Edwina off on holiday?
We've got to get out of here.
Are we still on?
- We're on, all right.
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in Hut 17.
You called?
Nick and...
- Fetcher. - At your service.
Over here.
We need more things.
- Right you are, Miss.
How about this quality tea set?
A lovely necklace and pendant.
Or this number. All the rage in the fashionable Paris chicken coops.
Simply pop it on, and as the French say: "Voila!"
That is French.
It's two hats in one, Miss.
For parties. For weddings.
Madame, you look like a vision, like a dream.
Like a duck.
- No, thank you.
We're making this. We need this.
Can you get it?
This is a big job, Miss.
Bigger than the others.
This will cost.
- The usual: One bag of seed.
You call this pay?
- It's chicken feed.
What could we give you?
- Eggs.
We can't. Our eggs are too valuable.
So are we.
After you, Fetcher.
After I what?
Move!
Stupid, worthless creatures!
I'm sick and tired of making minuscule profits.
Oh, yes.
Those chickens are up to something.
Quiet.
I'm onto something.
They're organized.
Quiet!
- That ginger one is their leader.
I may have found a way to make some real money.
What are you on about? Ridiculous notions of escaping chickens.
It's all in your head,
Mr. Tweedy. Say it.
It's all in my head.
Now you keep telling yourself that, because I won't hear another word about it. Is that clear?
Yes, luv.
But the ginger one!
They're chickens, you dolt!
Apart from you, they're the most stupid creatures on the planet!
They don't plot, they don't scheme, and they're not organized!
Order! Order!
Quiet, everyone.
Settle down.
I would like to call to order...
- Quiet!
Discipline in the ranks!
What! What!
Thank you, Fowler.
- In my RAF days, we never wasted time with unnecessary chitchat.
- Yes, thank you, Fowler.
Right.
Carry on.
Our last escape attempt was a bit of a fiasco, but Mac and I have a new plan.
Show them, Mac. - We tried going under that wire, and it didn't work.
So the plan is: We go over it.
This is us, right?
We get in like this and wind her up, and let her go!
Good grief!
The turnip's bought it.
Farmer's coming!
Operation Cover-Up!
Mr. Tweedy, where are you?
It's all in your head.
Think, everyone.
What haven't we tried yet?
We haven't tried not trying to escape.
Might work.
What about Edwina?
How many more empty nests will it take?
Maybe she should have spent more time laying eggs and less time escaping.
- Laying eggs, then getting plucked and roasted is good enough for you?
It's a living.
The fences aren't just around the farm.
They're up here in your heads.
There is a better place out there.
Somewhere beyond that hill, it has wide open spaces and lots of trees.
And grass. Can you imagine that?
Cool, green grass.
Who feeds us?
We feed ourselves.
- Where's the farm?
There is no farm.
- Then where does the farmer live?
There is no farmer.
- Is he on holiday?
He isn't anywhere.
Don't you get it?
No egg count, no farmers, no dogs, no coops and keys and no fences!
In all my life
I've never heard such a fantastic load of tripe!
Face the facts, ducks.
The chance of us getting out are a million to one.
Then there's still a chance!
Oh, no!
Who am I fooling?
I can't lead this bunch of...
Heaven help us.
Freedom!
Ladies and gentlemen, you've been a wonderful audience.
That's it.
Inside, quickly!
Here's our way out!
We'll make posters?
What's on the posters, Babs?
We'll fly out.
Must be important to be on a poster.
I wonder what he does.
Obviously, he's a professional flying rooster.
Flies around giving demonstrations.
Do you suppose?
- Absolutely!
No, not in there!
Get out!
Who are you? Where am I?
What happened to my wing?
You took a nasty fall.
- Spraining the anterior tendon connecting the radius to the humerus.
I wrapped it.
Was that English?
- She fixed your wing.
I made the bandage.
- I carried you in.
Back up and start from the top.
Where am I?
How rude of us. We're just excited...
This is a chicken farm.
And we're the chickens.
With you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens.
I don't like his look.
His eyes are too close together.
And he's a Yank! - Cockfighting's illegal where I come from.
Where is that? - A place I call home of the free, land of the brave.
Scotland!
No! America.
Poppycock!
Pushy Americans.
Always showing up late for every war.
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.
What's eating grandpa?
- Don't mind him, Mister...
My name's Rocky, the Rhode Island Red.
Rhodes for short.
Rocky Rhodes!
Catchy, ain't it?
Mr. Rhodes, is this you?
Who wants to know?
A group of desperate chickens.
If it's you, you may be the answer to our prayers.
Then call me a miracle, dollface,
'cause that's me.
What brings you to England,
Mr. Rhodes?
All the beautiful English chicks, of course.
Give over!
I'm a traveler.
I did that barnyard thing for a while, but couldn't get into it.
Hi. How are you?
Nope!
The open road is more my style.
Put a pack on my back and point me where the wind blows.
Know what they call me back home?
You'll love this.
The Lone Free-Ranger.
Isn't that great?
I knew it was possible.
- It's possible!
The answer had to come!
- Amen!
We'll fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes will show us how. Right?
That's ri... What?
Did you say "fly?"
You can teach us.
- No, I can't.
Listen! You hear that?
The open road's calling, and I have to answer.
Bye.
He must have very good hearing.
Okay, where's the exit?
This way.
Mr. Rhodes? Perhaps I didn't explain our situation properly.
We lay eggs, day in, day out.
When we can't lay any more, they kill us.
It's a cruel world, dollface.
Better get used to it.
Which part of "they kill us" don't you understand?
I got my own set of problems.
Besides, it can't be that hard to bust out of here.
Watch me.
It's not so hard for a chicken or two to get out, but it's about all of us.
All of you? - I've been trying to tell you. - Let's get it straight.
You want to get every chicken out of here at once?
Of course.
- You're certifiable.
You can't pull that off.
- Where there's a will, there's a way.
Couldn't agree more.
And I will be leaving. That way.
Mr. Rhodes, please!
So that's it.
You're from the circus.
You're on the run, aren't you?
Keep it down!
I'm trying to lay low here.
I should turn you in right now.
- You wouldn't.
Would you?
- Why not?
Because I'm cute?
Hey, hey. You crazy chick!
You know what'll happen if he finds me? - It's a cruel world.
I don't like you.
- I don't care.
Show us how to fly. - With this wing?
- Teach us, then.
He's valuable, you say?
Sure.
- Get the torch.
Listen here, sister.
I'm not going back to that life.
I'm a Lone Free-Ranger.
Emphasis on "free."
And that's what we want... freedom.
Fancy that, they're coming.
Oh, no! They're onto me!
Teach us to fly. We'll hide you.
- And if I don't?
Was your father by any chance a vulture?
Do we have a deal?
Time to make good on that deal, dollface. - The name is Ginger.
Comfortable?
- Not really.
Maybe this will help.
Nice hideout.
I had more room in my egg.
We held up our end of it.
Tomorrow you hold up yours.
What deal?
- Flying.
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
I'll teach you everything I know.
Which bunk is mine?
Absolutely outrageous!
Asking a senior officer to share his quarters.
And with a non-commissioned Yank, no less!
Why, back in my day...
You weren't exactly my first choice either.
Scoot over. Your wing's on my side of the bunk.
Your side of the bunk?
The whole bunk is my side!
What is that smell?
Is that your breath?
Absolutely outrageous!
So you want to fly, huh?
Well, it ain't going to be easy. And it ain't going to happen overnight.
Flying takes three things:
Hard work, perseverance and hard work.
- You said "hard work" twice!
Because it takes twice as much hard work as perseverance.
Codswallop!
Cocky Yanks think they know it all.
The most important thing is we have to work as a team.
Which means, you do everything I tell you.
Let's rock 'n roll.
The chickens are...
...pecking?
And left, two, three.
And right, two, three.
And stop right there.
Yes, down.
Make little circles.
Faster.
Oh, that's the spot!
I thought you were going to teach us to fly.
That's what I'm doing.
Isn't there usually some flapping involved?
Do I tell you how to lay eggs?
Relax.
We're making progress.
Really? I can't help feeling we're going around in circles.
Hey, cut it out!
You're making me dizzy.
They're ready to fly now.
Good, 'cause they can't walk anymore.
Up and at 'em!
Let's flap.
Let's see if old Attila the Hen has come to her senses.
It's raining hen!
What's this caper, luv?
- We're flying. - Obviously.
Flipping hell. Look at this.
- They're going to kill themselves.
Want to watch?
- All right.
Careful of those eggs!
Sunny-side up.
Now over easy.
Definitely scrambled.
Poultry in motion.
Birds of a feather flop together.
Great work, ladies.
The pain you're feeling is a good thing.
Pain is your friend.
Just keep the faith...
Agnes. You'll get there.
You flew four feet today.
Yeah, four feet.
From the roof to the ground.
All part of the process. Don't worry.
You cheesy little...
That doesn't sound good.
The ground's shaking.
Are we worried?
Are we worried?
The circus! Quick! Hide me!
Hide me!
- Come on.
One isn't awarded a medal for flapping about like a lunatic.
Now see here!
This is an officer's quarters!
In here!
- Get out of here now!
Give it a rest, Pops!
What? I shall have you on charges within the week!
Cheers, mate.
It's all in your head.
What's all this?
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy.
No more wasting time with petty egg collection and minuscule profits.
- No eggs?
We've always been egg farmers.
My father, his father and their fathers.
They were always...
Poor! Worthless! Nothings!
But that's about to change.
This will take Tweedy's farm out of the Dark Ages and into full-scale automated production.
Melisha Tweedy will be poor no longer.
I'll put it together, shall I?
That isn't good.
Whatever's in those boxes is for us.
And I doubt it's softer than hay.
I hate to be the voice of doom, but I've been calculating.
I don't think we're built for flying.
But I saw him!
He flew in over that fence!
I believe you, but if we could see it for ourselves it might answer some questions.
You're right. We've been at this all week. We're getting nowhere.
If his wing were better...
I'll talk to him.
Where is he?
They didn't give me this medal for being a Yank nanny.
"I don't know" would suffice.
Beware of that one, young Ginger.
That Yank is not to be trusted.
That Yank is our ticket out of here.
And the pig says to the horse,
"Why the long face?"
Cocktail!
Give over!
So anyway...
Remember those flying tips.
They're very important.
And think flighty thoughts.
They're swell chicks.
Look what Babs made me. A beak warmer.
Isn't that cute?
And that Bunty.
She really packs a pun.
A problem?
Have we flown over the fence?
- Not quite. - There's a problem.
Good things come to those who wait.
How long did it take you?
- To do what? - To learn to fly.
Apples and oranges.
I'm gifted, they're not.
You can't compare the two.
These things take time.
Which we're running out of. Why haven't we lifted off yet? - Thrust.
I went over my calculations.
What we're missing is thrust.
I didn't get a word of that.
Thrust. When ducks and geese take off, what do they have?
She ain't using real words.
She said we need more thrust.
- Thrust!
Sure. Thrust and flying are like this.
Flying and thrust.
Will you excuse us?
The wing!
No results by tomorrow, and the deal's off.
No more hiding. The farmers'll find you and back to the circus, fly boy.
You're the first chick I ever met with the shell still on.
Sleep tight, ·ngel face.
The Rock's on the case.
What? What?
A beaut. A fine piece of work.
If I do say so myself.
I say so myself, too.
- Wish I'd seen it.
We slipped into the farmer's room.
- Like a fish.
And we...
Like a fish?
You stupid idiot!
Anyway, here it is.
El merchandiso!
- That's Spanish.
What're these two crooks doing here?
So, you know each other!
- She don't think we're valuable.
You guys are the sneakiest, thieving parasites I've ever met.
Don't. Stop it.
- I've gone bright red.
So, how about the eggs?
Eggs? You promised them...
Yep, I promised them every egg I lay this month.
When can we expect the first one?
I'm brewing one up now.
I'll keep you posted.
A pleasure doing business with you.
Sucker.
What?
- You lied to them.
I didn't lie, dollface.
I just omitted certain truths.
I'll give them what I promised.
- Nothing. - Which they'll get.
And what will you give us?
Thrust.
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good.
Now this will get you going.
It's a thrust exercise.
The tension's killing me.
- It's gonna kill her.
Release!
Come on, flap!
You can do it. Flap!
Is that your first of-fence?
Roll call!
I haven't laid any eggs.
Three days, not one.
Why didn't you tell us?
- I was so busy flying...
They're coming!
- Hide me!
Hide yourself!
Double their food rations.
I want them all as fat as this one.
All of my life flashed before my eyes.
It was really boring.
Chicken feed!
My favorite!
Wait!
No, wait!
Babs, please! Bunty.
Stop it! Wait!
Stop!
Stop it!
Something is wrong here.
Can't you see that?
Strange boxes arrive.
Babs stops laying, but she isn't taken to the chop.
Extra food.
Don't you see?
They're fattening us up.
They're going to kill us all!
Heavy alert!
She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind? - Save some for me.
What are you doing?
Let go!
I've met some hard-boiled eggs before, but you're about 20 minutes.
Meaning what?
- Meaning, lighten up.
In America we have a rule:
To motivate someone, don't mention death!
Funny. Over here the rule is:
Always tell the truth!
It's been working like a charm.
You want them to perform, tell them what they want to hear.
You mean lie?
Here we go again.
Know what your problem is?
You're... difficult.
Why? Because I'm honest?
I care about them.
Something the Lone Free-Ranger doesn't know about.
- Then I hope you never care about me.
I never will.
- Good. - Fine.
What's all this?
Here she is.
Ask and you shall receive.
That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship.
Solid as a rock.
It's supposed to do that.
Perfect, guys.
How's that egg coming?
This is a double yolker.
I don't see what it has to do with...
- You will.
We've been working hard. Let's relax and shake those tail feathers.
Look at him!
Nellpodging around like a...
Good heavens!
What's happening?
That's called a beat. Feel it pulsing through your body?
Oh yes. Who'd have guessed?
Then go with it, baby!
Look, I'm going with it!
Bunty, what's got into you?
Same thing that's got into you.
Just go with the flow.
I don't recall authorizing a hop.
Shut up and dance.
What are you sobbing about, you nancy?
Little moments like this... it's what makes the job all worthwhile.
Want to dance?
Yeah, all right.
Did you see that? I flew!
Atta girl, Babsy! Atta girl.
Your wing! It's better!
How about that?
- Fantastic!
You can fly for us tomorrow.
Yeah, so it seems.
I flew!
I owe you an apology.
I didn't think you cared, but after all this...
Well, it seems I was wrong.
Easy, Miss Hard-Boiled.
I might think you're turning soft.
Listen.
I have to tell you something.
No! You'd better wait.
That's champion...
What is it?
A pie machine, you idiot. Chickens go in. Pies come out.
- What kind of pies?
Apple.
My favorite.
Chicken pies, you lummox!
Lmagine:
In less than a fortnight, every grocer will be stocked with boxes of Mrs. Tweedy's
Homemade Chicken Pies.
Just "Mrs."? - Woman's touch.
Makes the public feel comfortable.
Oh, right. How does it work?
Get me a chicken, and I'll show you.
I know just the one.
I've got a score to settle with you.
Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!
We mustn't panic! We mustn't panic!
Quiet, I say!
Let's have some discipline!
The enemy has a prisoner.
This calls for retaliation! Retaliation!
- What's going on?
They got Ginger.
They're taking her to the chop!
What are you waiting for, laddie?
Fly over there. Save her.
Of course! No!
Just what they'd expect.
Give them the old element of surprise!
And catch Jerry with his trousers down!
I like that. What's the plan?
The plan...
The plan... Babs!
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.
Look at the size of that thing.
Oh, no.
Chickens go in, pies come out.
Chicken pies. Not apple pies.
Chicken!
Great! Brilliant!
Yo! Baby doll!
I'm coming!
- Hurry!
I'm still coming!
- Come on! Stop this thing!
I'm getting there.
Shoot!
I'll be down before you can say... mixed vegetables?
D'oh! Get it?
Dough.
- I'm stuck!
Nothing to it.
Hang on.
Look out.
It's like an oven in here.
Come on!
Wait!
Go over to the...
The door! Come on!
She's gonna blow! Run!
What did you do, you great pudding? - Nothing.
Turn it off!
- It won't turn off!
We've got to show the others. Come on!
Look. I fixed it.
Chicken pies?
Yes, but...
I don't want to be a pie!
I don't like gravy.
Ladies, let's not lose our heads.
Lose our heads?
What I meant was, Rocky sabotaged the machine and bought us more time.
And better still, he's going to fly for us tomorrow.
Once we see how,
I know we'll get it.
So don't worry. Tomorrow everything is going to go much smoother.
Alright, Pops, what did I do now?
A very brave and honorable deed.
In the light of your action today,
I dutifully admit that I misjudged your character.
I present you with this medal for bravery.
And I salute you.
In honor of this occasion,
I surrender the bunk entirely.
I shall sleep under the stars.
I await tomorrow's flying demonstration with great anticipation.
You and me both, Pops.
Oh, were you...?
- Is this your...?
Since you're here...
- I'm glad you're here...
You go first.
- You go ahead.
I just wanted to say, I may have been a bit harsh at first...
What I really mean is... thank you for saving my life.
For saving our lives.
You know,
I come up here every night and look at that hill, imagining what it's like on the other side.
It's funny...
I've never actually felt grass beneath my feet. I'm sorry.
I'm rambling on about grass, and you had something to say.
It's just that... life, as I've experienced it, out there lone free-ranging and stuff...
It's full of disappointments.
So grass isn't all it's cracked up to be?
Grass! Exactly.
It's always greener on the other side.
And then you get there, and it's brown and prickly.
See what I'm saying?
What I'm trying to say is... you're welcome.
You know, that hill is looking closer tonight than it ever has before.
Good night, Rocky.
Good night,
Ginger.
Company, attention!
Today's the day, girls.
We're going to fly. I can feel it.
Finally, we get to see a professional in action.
Start warming up. I'll go get him.
Rocky? Knock, knock.
Everyone's waiting, so I told them...
A cannon.
That'd give you a thrust.
- I knew he was fake all along.
In fact, I'm not even sure if he was American.
What's the next plan?
Face it. The only way we get out is wrapped in pastry.
Perhaps he just went on holiday.
- Perhaps he left to get away from your infernal knitting!
You always hit him.
See how you like it.
Don't push me, four-eyes!
Quiet!
Quiet, I say! Dissention in the ranks. Just what Jerry wants.
The old divide and conquer.
A proper squadron work together, just like we did in my RAF days.
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map, and Whizzbang at the tail-end Charlie.
Wingco would give the call, hop in the old crate, chocks away!
That's how you get medals!
Will you shut up about your stupid bloomin' medals!
How dare you!
Forgive me.
As an officer...
Everyone, shut up!
What exactly is the RAF?
What do you mean?
The Royal Air Force is what.
Then what's the "old crate"?
There she is!
Gorgeous, isn't she? - You mean, you flew? In one of these?
Beautifully built. In fact, there's a bit of a story there.
We were on a reconnaissance flight, when the weather duffed up.
Yes... of course.
We may be able to pull this off.
We're still flying out of here.
Fowler's provided the answer.
- I have?
Oh, yes. Of course I have.
How have I?
We'll make a crate.
Mac, you'll handle engineering.
Babs, manufacturing.
Fowler is chief aviation adviser.
Bunty, eggs.
Eggs?
Right. Like the ones the rooster was going to lay.
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they?
Don't they? - It's a lady thing, apparently. Ask your mum.
One egg per item on the list.
First payment in advance.
- Right. When do we start?
What the dickens?
Oh, gnomes now!
Eggs from heaven!
- No, from her bum.
Idiot!
That was close. Too close.
We can't stop now.
Everyone, go for it.
Go, go!
Mac! We need the calculations quick.
Agnes, that has to be really secure.
Careful up there, Fowler!
Bunty, give him a hand.
Well done, Babs. Keep it up!
No problem, dollface.
Ah, boy.
Come on.
Please!
Oh, no.
He's fixed it.
Get the chickens.
Which ones?
All of them!
My tools!
Thieving little buggers.
What's the plan?
Attack!
Nice plan.
The chickens are revolting!
Finally, something we agree on.
Help!
Under the hut!
What have we done?
- This is it.
We're escaping!
What? Now?
Now!
But she's not ready.
- Listen!
We either die free chickens or die trying.
Are those the only choices?
- Let's do it!
Scramble!
The exits are located here and here.
In the likely event of an emergency, put your head between your knees...
...and kiss your bum goodbye.
Okay, Fowler. Ready for takeoff.
Behind you all the way.
You're supposed to be up there.
You're the pilot!
Don't be ridiculous.
I can't fly this contraption.
But back in your day... the Royal Air Force.
644 Squadron, poultry division.
We were the mascots.
You mean you never flew the plane?
Good heavens, no. I'm a chicken.
The Royal Air Force doesn't let chickens fly a complex aircraft!
We're all gonna die.
- Fowler, you have to fly it.
You always talk about
"back in your day."
Well, today is your day.
You can do it, you old sausage.
Wing Commander T.I. Fowler, reporting for duty.
What're you waiting for?
Let's get this crate off the ground!
Fowler, now!
Roger! Contact!
Cleared for takeoff!
Chocks away!
Full throttle!
We need more power!
I can't work miracles.
We're givin' her all she's got!
Gotcha!
Hard right!
Oh, mother.
Turn her around.
I'll get the ramp.
Put the ramp down!
You are going to be a pie.
Look out!
Clear the runway!
Let's go!
We're flying!
That's for leaving.
And this is for coming back.
Great Scott! What was that?
A cling-on!
The engines can't take it!
My goodness!
Babs! Scissors!
Lower me down.
- But... - Just do it.
Increase velocity!
What's that mean?
- Pedal your flippin' giblets out!
Lower!
- I'm trying!
Look out!
Fire! Fire!
My eggs!
More ammo! Hurry!
We got no more eggs!
Look out!
No!
Bombs away!
Mr. Tweedy!
That was good! That was good!
The old bird bought it!
I told you they was organized.
We did it, everyone!
Keep pedaling. We're not there yet.
You can't see paradise if you don't pedal.
Put your drumsticks into it.
That's what I told them. We were losing altitude, heading for...
A lovely holiday.
I'll be sad to go back.
Safety at all times is imperative.
Wind her up and let her go.
So...
Is it as good as you imagined?
- No.
It's better.
I'll show you how to play cricket.
Here's a thought.
Let's get an egg and start our own chicken farm.
We'll have all the eggs we can eat.
- Right.
We'll need a chicken then.
- No, an egg first.
That's where the chicken comes from.
No. Without the chicken where do you get the egg?
From a chicken... that comes from the egg.
But you need an egg to have a chicken.
You got to get the chicken first to get the egg.
Then you get the chicken.
Hang on. Let's go over this again.
The egg, obviously.
Rolling along happily, then crack!
It hatches the first chicken.
But where'd the egg come from?
What do you mean? - Egg comes rolling along happily and wonders, where'd it come from without a chicken? No eggs come rolling along.
Without an egg to hatch the chicken there'll be no chicken to lay the first egg. - Have we got
2 eggs now? - No, still the first egg.
What about the first chicken?
- It's in the very first egg.
Guys!
I'm trying to enjoy paradise.
Sorry, guv.
- Won't happen again.
Thanks.
Gitface.
- Pillock.
Thinks he's such a big shot
'cause he's got his name on a poster.
These show biz folk are all the same.
- Yeah, the rats are the stars, actually.
- Yeah, of course they are.
- We do all the work, he gets all the credit.
- But he does get all the birds.
- He gets everything.
- Yes, he does. Everything.
- You said it, mate.
- I know.
Love is a song that never ends
Life may be swift and fleeting
Hope may die
Yet love's beautiful music
Comes each day like the dawn
Love is a song that never ends
One simple theme repeating
Like the voice of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music flows on
Like the voice of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music flows on
Hoo!
Hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo.
Hoo-hoo!
- Wake up! Wake up!
- Oh, what now?
- Wake up, Friend Owl.
- Hey, what's going on around here?
- Wake up!
- It's happened. It's happened.
The new prince is born.
- We're going to see him.
- Come on. You better hurry up.
Oh. Well, look.
- Well.
- Isn't he cute?
Oh...
Well... this is quite an occasion.
Yes, sir, it isn't every day a prince is born.
You're to be congratulated.
- Yes, congratulations.
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.
Come on. Wake up.
We have company.
Hello. Hello, there.
- Hello, little prince.
- Hello. Hello, there.
Hello, little prince.
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Look! He's trying to get up.
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?
Thumper!
Well, he is.
Aren't you?
Looks to me like he's getting kind of sleepy.
I think it's time we all left.
Come on. Shoo-shoo! Psst!
Come on. Shoo-shoo!
Psst!
Psst!
Thumper. Come on.
Whatcha gonna call him?
Well... I think I'll call him Bambi.
Bambi.
Yep, I guess that'll do all right.
Bambi.
My little Bambi.
Walking already. Well, what do you know.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs Quail.
And where's the young prince this mo... Oh!
- Good morning, Bambi.
- Good morning, young prince.
Goodbye.
Good morning, young prince.
Good morning, young prince.
Good morning. Hm.
Nice sunny day.
- What's the matter?
- What happened?
Did the young prince fall down?
- Is he hurt?
- No, he's all right.
He doesn't walk very good, does he?
Thumper.
Yes, Mama?
What did your father tell you this morning?
If you can't say something nice... don't say nothing at all.
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.
Come on, get up. Get up, Bambi.
- Get up.
- Try again.
I'm thumping. That's why they call me Thumper.
...call me Thumper.
- Thumper!
- Thumper!
Come on. You can do it.
Hop over it. Like this.
- Hop over it.
- Hop over it.
Like this.
You didn't hop far enough.
That's it. Now the other one.
Gee whiz, what happened that time?
Those are birds.
Bur.
Bur!
Look, he's trying to talk.
Bur!
He's trying to say "bird".
Say "bird".
Bur.
Bird.
Bur.
Uh-uh.
Bird.
Come on, say "bird", say "bird".
Say "bird". Say "bird".
Come on, say "bird".
Say "bird".
Bird!
He talked! He talked!
He talked, Mama.
The young prince said "bird".
Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird, bird...
Bird!
No, that's not a bird.
That's a butterfly.
Butterfly?
Butter...
Butterfly.
No, that's a flower.
- Flower?
- Uh-huh, it's pretty.
Purty.
Flower!
Me?
No, no.
That's not a flower.
- He's a little...
- Oh, that's all right.
He can call me a flower if he wants to.
I don't mind.
Purty! Purty flower!
Oh... gosh.
I think I better go home now.
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower

Mother, what we going to do today?
I'm going to take you to the meadow.
Meadow? What's the meadow?
It's a very wonderful place.
Then why haven't we been there before?
You weren't big enough.
- Mother, you know what?
- What?
We're not the only deer in the forest.
- Where did you hear that?
- Thumper told me.
Well, he's right.
There are many deer in the forest besides us.
Then why don't I ever see them?
- You will, sometime.
- On the meadow?
Perhaps.
Hush now.
We're almost there.
- The meadow!
- Wait!
Bambi, wait!
You must never rush out on the meadow.
There might be danger.
Out there, we're unprotected.
The meadow is wide and open, and there are no trees or bushes to hide us.
So we have to be very careful.
Wait here.
I'll go out first. And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.
Come on.
Good morning, Prince Bambi.
Good morning, young prince.
Hello. What ya eatin'?
- Clover.
- It's awfully good.
It's delicious.
Why don't you try some?
No, no, not that green stuff.
Just eat the blossoms.
That's the good stuff.
Thumper.
- Yes, Mama?
- What did your father tell you?
About what?
About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens?
Oh, that one.
Eating greens is a special treat.
It makes long ears and great big feet.
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.
I made that last part up myself.
Watch out.
Watch out.
That's little Faline.
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?
Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello.
Hello, Bambi.
I said hello.
Well, aren't you going to answer her?
You're not afraid, are you?
Well, then, go ahead.
Go on, say hello.
Hello.
You!
He stopped and looked at me.
Yes, I know.
Why was everyone still when he came on the meadow?
Everyone respects him.
For of all the deer in the forest, not one has lived half so long.
He's very brave and very wise.
That's why he's known as the
Great Prince of the Forest.
Faline!
Bambi!
Mother!
Bambi!
Bambi!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Come on out, Bambi.
Come on.
It's safe now.
We don't have to hide any longer.
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?
Man... was in the forest.
Mother, look! What's all that white stuff?
Why, it's snow.
- Snow?
- Yes.
Winter has come.
Hiya, Bambi.
Watch what I can do.
Whoo!
Come on! It's all right!
Look!
The water's stiff.
Yippee!
Some fun, huh, Bambi?
Come on, get up. Like this.
No, no.
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?
Got to watch both ends at the same time.
Guess you better unwind it.
Arghh!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Flower!
Is it spring yet?
No. Winter's just started.
What ya doin'? Hibernatin'?
Uh-huh.
What do you want to do that for?
All us flowers sleep in the winter.
Well... good night.
Winter sure is long, isn't it?
It seems long.
But it won't last forever.
I'm awful hungry, Mother.
Yes, I know.
Bambi.
Bambi, come here.
Look.
New spring grass.
Bambi. Quick!
The thicket!
Faster! Faster, Bambi!
Don't look back! Keep running!
Keep running!
We made it!
We made it, Mother!
We...
Mother!
Mother!
Mother, where are you?!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Your mother can't be with you anymore.
Come.
My son.
Let's sing a gay little spring song
This is the season to sing
So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best
And warble a song about spring
Spring, spring, spring
Let's get together and sing
Let's sing a gay little spring song
Just like the bird on the wing
Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright
So let's get together and sing
Sing, sing, sing
Let's sing a song about spring
Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May
Get into the mood
And be merry today
Forget all your troubles
And warble away...
Wait!
Oh, what now?
Hey! Hey!
Stop that racket!
Scat! Shoo! Shoo!
Let's sing a song about spring
I'll fix 'em.
There. I guess... that'll teach 'em.
Oh, what's the use?
This is the season to sing
Same thing every spring.
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!
Love's sweet song.
Hm! Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.
Stop it!
Get out of here. All of you.
And you, too!
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?
Why, it... it's the young prince.
Bambi!
My, my, how you've changed.
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.
I see you've traded in your spots for a pair of antlers.
You know, just the other day I was talking to myself about you.
And we were wondering what had become of you.
Hello, Bambi!
Remember me?
Thumper!
Right-o!
Hi, fellas.
Flower.
Yeah.
Well, what's the matter with them?
Why are they acting that way?
Why, don't you know?
They're twitterpated.
- Twitterpated?
- Yes.
Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time.
For example... you're walking along, minding your own business, you're looking neither to the left nor to the right, when all of a sudden... you run smack into a pretty face.
You begin to get weak in the knees.
Your head's in a whirl.
And then you feel light as a feather.
And before you know it, you're walking on air.
And then you know what?
You're knocked for a loop.
And you completely lose your head.
Gosh, that's awful.
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.
And that ain't all.
It can happen to anybody.
So you'd better be careful.
It could happen to you, and you, and...
Yes, it could even happen to you.
Well, it's not going to happen to me.
- Me neither.
- Me neither.
Ha! Twitterpated!
Oh...
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Bambi.
Don't you remember me?
I'm Faline.
Bambi.
Bambi.
Bambi!
I bring you a song
And I sing as I go
For I want you to know
That I'm looking for romance
I bring you a song
In the hope that you'll see
When you're looking at me
That I'm looking for love
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when you're young and it's May
Only found on that wonderful day
When all longing is through
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when a thrill is complete
Only found when two hearts gently beat
To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
You're by my side
There's a moon up above
It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright
It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
And you
It is Man.
He is here again.
There are many this time.
We must go deep into the forest.
Hurry! Follow me!
Faline!
Bambi.
Bambi, where are you?
Bambi!
Bambi!
Faline!
Faline!
Faline!
Listen.
- He's coming!
- Hush!
Be quiet.
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.
Whatever you do, don't fly.
He's almost here! I can't stand it any longer!
Bambi! Bambi!
Faline!
Bambi!
Bambi!
Quick, Faline! Jump!
Get up, Bambi.
Get up!
You must get up.
Get up!
Get up!
Now... come with me.
Bambi.
Hoo!
Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl.
Wake up, Friend Owl.
Oh, what now?
Hey, what's going on around here?
- It's happened.
- Happened?
Yes. In the thicket.
Hurry up, Bambi.
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.
Oh. Well.
Look.
- Two of them.
- Oh!
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen a more likely looking pair of fawns.
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.
Love is a song that never ends
One simple theme repeating
Like the voice
Of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music
Flows on
Thundershowers are expected in the Crocodile Falls area
and some of the surrounding gullies, so take out your...
Cody!
Yeah, Mom?
- What about your breakfast?
- I've got some sandwiches in my pack.
- Be home for supper.
- No worries, Mom.
I know, I'm coming.
Hustle up, Nelson.
Faloo's sounding the call!
Come on, little wombats, hurry!
Who's caught this time?
You don't know her, Cody.
Her name is Marahute, the great golden eagle.
Where is she?
She's caught, high on a cliff in a poacher's trap.
- You're the only one who can reach her.
- I'll get her loose.
Righto. Hop on, no time to lose.
She's up on top of that ridge.
Be careful, little friend.
Marahute!
Calm down, calm down.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
That's a girl. Stay still.
It's okay.
No, wait! I'm here to help you.
Easy! Easy!
You're free!
Higher!
Whoa!
Wow.
You're a mom!
They're very warm.
Are they gonna hatch soon?
Where's the daddy eagle?
Oh. My dad's gone, too.
Hey, little fella, what happened to you?
Oh, no! Get away!
- Don't worry. I'll get you loose.
- It's a trap. Careful!
Got one!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okey-dokey.
- Wait! Hey, come back!
Here you go, grab on.
That's great. Just a little more, a little further...
There! I got it.
Well, Joanna, what'd we get today?
A dingo, a fat ol' razorback, or a nice big...
Boy?
Joanna, you been diggin' holes out here again?
Dumb lizard always trying to bury squirrels out here.
Uh-uh. It's a trap, and poaching's against the law.
Trap? Where'd you get an idea like that?
I think you've been down in that hole for too long.
Come on, grab hold.
We'll get you out of this old lizard hole and you can just run along home.
This is a poacher's trap and you're a poacher.
Let go! Hey, get off of me.
McLEACH: I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill that dumb, slimy, egg-sucking salamander.
Cut it out! Get off of me.
Hmm.
Good girl, Joanna.
Say, where'd you get this pretty feather, boy?
It was a present.
That's real nice. Who gave it to you?
It's a secret.
That's no secret, boy.
You see, I already got the father.
You just tell me where Momma and those little eggs are.
No!
Joanna, sic him!
You're coming with me, boy.
My mom'll call the rangers!
Oh, no. Not the rangers.
What'll I do?
What'll I do? Don't let your mom call the rangers!
Please don't!
"My poor baby boy got eaten by the crocodiles!"
Boo hoo hoo.
Let's go, boy!
Help!
Help!
Help! Someone, help!
McLeach took a little boy.
Send for help!
Code red, code red! Attention all
Rescue Aid Society delegates.
All delegates report immediately to the main assembly hall.
This is an emergency meeting.
I repeat, this is a code red emergency meeting!
Order!
Yes, I know it's late, but I'm...
Really? Pajamas?
Hello, Frank, how are you?
Nice to see you!
And Esmerelda, there you are!
Quiet now, please, everyone pay attention.
There has been a kidnapping in Australia.
A young boy needs our help.
This is a mission requiring our very finest,
and I know we are all thinking of the same two mice.
What's this? Gone?
We must find Bernard and
Miss Bianca at once!
Oh, pea soup.
Pea soup!
To my dear Bernard, and our wonderful partnership.
Uh, yeah, wonderful.
You've been very quiet this evening.
Is there something on your mind?
Well, um, actually...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, darling?
I... Miss Bianca, would you...
Would you...
Would you excuse me for a minute?
Pardonnez-moi, Mademoiselle
Bianca, I have important news.
Yes, François? What is it?
You and Bernard have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to Australia.
The poor boy. This is dreadful.
Now where is Bernard?
I must tell him at once!
Allow me, madame,
I will tell him immediately.
Miss Bianca, will you marry me?
Quickly, Monsieur Bernard!
I must speak with you.
- Not now, François, I'm busy!
- No, monsieur, you don't...
- Bernard, did you talk to François?
- Yes, but there's something I want...
I know what you're going to say.
François told me about it.
He did? How did he...
It doesn't matter, I think it's a marvelous idea.
You do?
I mean, you really want to?
I don't think it's a matter of wanting, it's a matter of duty.
Duty? I never thought of it...
Well, all right. How does next April sound to you?
Heavens, no! We must act immediately, tonight!
Tonight? But wait!
Bianca, this is so sudden. I mean, don't you at least need a gown or something?
No, just a pair of khaki shorts and some hiking boots!
Hiking boots?
Oh, there you are.
Come along, come along.
Delegates, we have an important announcement.
Bernard and I have decided to accept the mission to Australia.
Australia?
Good show! Now, you must fly out immediately!
It's a little nippy outside, but we won't let that stop us, will we?
Miss Bianca, I'm not sure it's a good idea to fly this soon after eating!
Darling, you'll be just fine!
But aren't you supposed to wait 45 minutes?
Oh, just knock on the door and see if Orville is there!
Nobody's home, let's go.
This is no time to play in the snow.
I wasn't playing in the snow.
It was an avalanche.
Look, Bernard!
"Under new management, see Wilbur."
Come on, darling.
Let's get a move out!
I'm the cat's pajamas
Always run around with crazy little mamas
Whoo!
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Wilbur!
Get down there, son!
Hello?
Pick it, boy, pick it! Yeah!
Whoo! Here we go! Let's walk!
Whoo!
Look out! Excuse me, sir.
Do something! He can't hear us!
Big time, big time!
The girls all look when I go by...
Who killed the music?
That's better.
Excuse us for interrupting.
We're from the Rescue Aid Society.
I am Miss Bianca, and this is my...
The Miss Bianca? I don't believe it.
My brother, Orville, told me all about you. Boy. This is an honor to have...
May I just say, "Enchanté, señorita," to you? May I?
We need to charter a flight.
You've come to the right place, buddy boy. Welcome to...
"Albatross Air. A fair fare from here to there."
Get it? A fair fare?
It's a play on... Never mind.
I've got tons of exotic destinations, faraway places, custom designed for a romantic weekend getaway.
The finest in-flight accommodations.
Speaking of which, what can I get you?
How about a nice mango Maui cooler?
Very nice, very tasty.
No, thank you.
A coconut, guava nectar?
It's carbonated.
I got little umbrellas for each one, and a little coconut thing.
- It's urgent that we leave immediately!
- Nothing? Nothing at all?
- How about a cream soda?
- We need a flight to Australia.
Australia? The land down under?
That's a fabulous idea!
So when can I pencil you in?
After spring thaw?
Mid-June would be very nice.
We must leave tonight.
Tonight?
Come on, you're kidding me, right?
Have you looked outside?
It's suicide out there.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm afraid your jolly little holiday will have to wait.
What a bunch of jokers.
But you don't understand, a boy needs our help. He's in trouble.
Boy? You mean, a little kid kinda boy?
He was kidnapped.
Kidnapped? Oh, that's awful.
Locking up a little kid.
A kid should be free.
Free to run wild through the house on Saturday mornings.
Free to have cookies and milk, and get those little white mustaches.
Nobody's gonna take a kid's freedom away while I'm around.
Does that mean you'll take us?
Storm or no storm,
Albatross Airlines, at your service!
Passengers are requested to fasten their seat belts and secure all carry-ons.
We'll be departing following our pre-flight maintenance. Thank you.
Loosen up, get the blood flowing up to the head.
And a couple of these...
Okay, one's enough, there we go.
Ah, yeah! That feels better. Oh, baby.
Tie your kangaroos down, sports fans!
Here we come!
Let's go for it! Whoa! Hey!
I didn't adjust for the winds.
All right, we're gonna make it!
Gotta duck down lower.
Go under the wind, go under it!
Here we go! Whoo-hoo!
Ow! This is cold!
Slippery! Ice!
We got ice!
Whoa! Hang on now!
Here we go!
Whoa! Cowabunga!
Captain, is this a non-stop flight to Australia?
Well, not exactly no.
I could definitely say no.
We're gonna have to make connections with a bigger bird.
Non-stop? What do I look like,
Charles Lindbergh?
Let me out of here! Let me go!
You can't do this!
Help!
Breaker, breaker, little mate.
I forgot to tell you around here, you need to be quiet!
Or the rangers might hear you.
Now sit down and relax, enjoy the view.
Nothing but abandoned opal mines as far as the eye can see.
And dead ahead, is home sweet home.
Home, home on the range
Where the critters are tied up in chains
I cut through their sides
And I rip off their hides
And the next day, I do it again
Everybody!
Home, home on the range...
Cody! Cody!
Cody!
Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12 is now approaching Sydney airport.
Make sure your seat belts are fastened and tables secured.
Enjoy your stay in Australia.
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.
Perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.
All right, I'll get him up.
Wilbur.
Wilbur!
Just five more minutes, Ma.
- Wilbur!
- That's all I need, five more minutes.
Wilbur, are you awake?
- Get up, we're there!
- I'm up, I'm up.
Watch out!
Must have been sleeping on a bolt.
Oh, boy.
Throw another shrimp on the barbie, 'cause here I come!
- Here we go again!
- Cannonball!
Gangway! Coming through.
Mice on board!
Clear the way! Move over madam, there you go!
Coming through, sir. Thank you.
Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.
Did we lose anyone back there?
Miss Bianca, from now on, can't we just take the train?
Well, Sparky, you've had this coming for a long time.
And now, you're gonna get it.
Ha!
Wise fly.
Mugwomp tower,
this is Albatross 1-3 requesting permission to land. Over?
Albatross? Let's see.
Finch, wren, scrub-bird, lorikeet, freckled duck, galah,
Kookaburra, parrot, cockatoo, alba... It's a jumbo!
Negative, you'll have to turn back.
- Our runway isn't long enough for you.
- Not long enough?
Look pal, I can land this thing on a dime!
Wilbur, if the runway isn't long enough...
You can't let radar jockeys push you around. Leave it to me.
I say again, mate, our runway is too short.
And I say again, mate, I'm coming in!
Crazy Yank. Quick, Sparky, we gotta extend the runway.
Here we go!
We'll never make it!
Hot!
Passengers, please remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop.
Thank you.
Whoa!
Quick, Sparky, we need to make a drag line!
Don't try and tell me the runway's too short.
Hold this for me, will you, pal?
Bloke ought to have his wings clipped.
Captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines...
Crazy Yanks.
They think they can do any fool thing without regard for...
Welcome to Australia, ma'am.
Name's Jake. If there's any way
I can make your stay pleasant, don't hesitate to ask.
- Oh, how kind.
- Allow me to get that bag for you.
I've got a lot of luggage here.
Let me give you a hand with those.
Part of the friendly service at Albatross...
Ow! Big time hurt!
Back! It's out!
- Are you all right?
- Don't worry, I'll handle this.
Sparky, watch the tower. We gotta get this bird to the hospital.
Can't go down, can't go up.
Take the bags!
- Heave! Ho!
- What are you doing?
What's going on? Wait!
- Wait a minute. Just stop everything.
- Wilbur, don't worry.
We'll come back the moment we find the boy.
Wait! Wait a minute!
Don't leave me here, please!
I'm feeling much better now.
I'm even ready to hit the beaches.
I'm even ready to mambo.
Doctor, will he be all right?
Now, my dear. Keep a stiff upper lip.
They all come in with a whimper, and leave with a grin.
Off with you now. Leave everything to me. Shoo, shoo. Off you go.
Hop to it, ladies. We've got a bent bird on our hands.
- Move, bustle, bustle. That's it.
- Will it hurt, Doc?
Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.
- Launch the back brace!
- Hey, wait!
I've been skewered!
I've already missed tea, Mr. Albatross.
Now don't force me to take drastic measures. You must relax.
Relax? I have never been more relaxed in my life!
If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead!
I'm not convinced.
60 milligrams!
60 milligrams.
Hey! What?
Are you guys crazy?
You can't do that to me!
I'm an American citizen, buddy!
- Better double it!
- Double?
- Double, coming up!
- No!
Prepare the albatross for medication.
I'm dreaming! Come on,
Wilbur. Wake up, boy!
- Three degrees right.
- Come on!
- Three degrees right.
- Down two degrees.
Don't go down two!
- Down two degrees.
- Ready!
No, I'm not ready! No, please!
Aim!
Please don't do this to me.
Fire!
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
So are you and your husband here on a little outback excursion?
No, we're not married.
In fact, we're here on a top secret mission.
Very hush-hush.
Gonna rescue that kid McLeach nabbed?
Why, that's right! How did you know?
You'll find it's tough to keep secrets in the outback, miss.
So which way you taking?
Suicide Trail through Nightmare
Canyon, or shortcut at Satan's Ridge?
- "Suicide Trail"?
- Good choice.
More snakes, less quicksand.
Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot-free, that is until...
Dead Dingo Pass.
Wait a minute, I don't see any of that stuff on the map.
A map's no good in the outback!
What you really need is someone who knows the territory.
Mr. Jake, will you guide us?
At your service!
Better take my arm, miss.
It's gonna be a treacherous hike.
I remember the time it was just me and 400 of these big, giant...
Doesn't even know how to fold a map.
This is how we get around in the outback, Miss B.
The only way to travel, Berno.
Yeah, it's just a little bumpy back here.
Cinch up your seat belts, mates.
We're coming in for a landing.
Hold it, not yet!
Well, boy, let's see if we can do something to refresh that rusty, old memory of yours.
Is she on Satan's Ridge?
Or Nightmare Canyon?
What do you think?
Yeah, that's it.
Right smack dab in the middle at Croc Falls!
- Am I getting warm?
- I told you, I don't remember.
Don't you realize a bird that size is worth a fortune?
I'll split the money 50/50.
You can't get a better offer than that.
You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you.
Jake's been gone... Ow!
Been gone a long time.
Maybe I should go... Oh!
Maybe I should go look for him.
Don't you worry about Jake.
He can handle himself.
Yeah, I noticed.
I am just sure he'll be back in no time.
You know, now that we're alone, there's...
There's something that I've been wanting to ask you.
Yes? What is it?
Well, it's like this.
Miss Bianca, I would be most honored if...
Look out!
No mice for you, Twister, not today!
There!
Miss Bianca!
I've been looking all over for you.
Now look.
We got a long way to go, and you're gonna take us there.
You're not gonna give us any trouble about it.
Right?
They're harmless once you look them in the eye, let them know who's boss.
Ain't that right, mate? Now get.
It's all right, Bernard.
Jake has everything under control.
Yeah, I noticed.
You know, Miss Bianca, truth be told,
I used to be quite a dingo wrestler.
There was this one time, it was just me and 300 of these ferocious, mouse-eating dingoes.
Had me surrounded...
I'll give you a night down here to think it over.
But tomorrow, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Joanna! You thick-headed chunk of fish-bait!
I'll never tell you where she is!
Never! Never!
Yeah, we'll never tell!
You'll have to drag it out of us!
Hey, where did you come from?
The desert?
Well, fancy that!
Looks like McLeach has begun trapping his own kind!
There's no hope for any of us now.
No hope? No hope!
- No!
- But there must be a way out of here.
There's a way out, all right.
There is?
Absolutely.
You'll go as a wallet, you'll go as a belt, and our dear Frank...
- I don't want to hear it.
- Frank will go as...
I can't hear you!
- A purse.
- No!
A lovely ladies' purse.
I don't want to go as a purse.
Please, don't let him do it!
- Don't worry, we'll get out of here.
- We are?
Yeah. If we all put our heads together,
I'm sure we'll think of something.
Yeah, something.
Frank, what's wrong?
Oh, here he goes again.
Take it easy. You don't want to hurt yourself again.
Ooh. I got it!
All we gotta do is get the keys!
Oh. Is that all? Well then, we better start packing our bags.
No, wait. He's right.
If we could get these long pieces of wood...
Yeah, wood, good.
Maybe we could...
That's right, just a little more. There!
Come on, everybody.
Get some more stuff!
The kid's right.
What are we waiting for?
That's it, you've got it!
Hurry. We need something to tie it together.
Hey, what do you got?
Shoelaces!
Almost.
- A little further.
- Yeah, yeah.
- it's okay. Let's try again.
- Yeah, yeah.
Easy. Easy does it.
Yeah, no, no! Yeah, yeah.
Will somebody shut him up?
- We did it!
- You've got it!
I've got it! I'll just take my tail, and I'll pick the lock, like this!
Frank, give it a rest.
You'll thank me when you're free.
Look, I just insert my tail, like this, and I turn it like this, just a quarter turn to the left, and then push it a little bit further.
Show him who's boss, Berno!
I feel like I got my head in a vice.
Oh!
- Are we ready, nurse?
- Ready, Doctor.
All right, ladies, snap to it!
Ooh, that smarts!
Ah, let me see here.
- Forceps!
- Forceps.
Oh, no, what now?
- Spinal stretch-u-lator.
- That's gonna hurt.
Artery router.
Mother!
This is rusted tight. I wouldn't dream of using such a tool.
Bring me the epidermal tissue disrupter!
The epidermal what?
Oh, no! No!
Mr. Albatross, we haven't operated yet!
- You gotta catch me first, Doc.
- Mr. Albatross, please!
Cowabunga!
Mr. Albatross, we must return you to the operating room!
You'll never take me alive!
Please don't do this!
Your spine needs tender... loving... care!
Oh! Oh!
My back!
Hey! Hey!
I can... It works! I'm cured!
My back!
Don't worry!
I'm coming, you little mice.
This is the finest fleet on two webbed feet.
Oh, boy, I gotta go on a diet when I get home.
Here we go!
In other news, authorities in Mugwomp Flats
called off the search for the missing boy.
His backpack was found near
Crocodile Falls, and rangers believe
he was yet another victim of crocodile attack.
Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution...
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?
Who outsmarted who?
Who? Who outsmarted who?
I still gotta get that boy to talking.
I'm hungry. Can't think on an empty stomach.
Gotta have protein. Gotta have eggs.
Everyone's got his price.
All I gotta do is offer him whatever he wants, and then not give it to him.
Did you take one of my eggs?
Open your mouth.
These are not Joanna eggs.
Let's see. The boy's got the eagle.
I want the eagle.
The boy won't give me the eagle.
If I could just find the boy's weak spot,
I could get him to tell me where the eagle is.
But the boy's only got one weak spot, and that is the eagle.
Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill, that would loosen his tongue and then...
I got it!
Got your hand caught in the cookie jar.
Who you think you're messing with, you dumb animal?
My mental facilities are twice what yours are, you pea brain.
Joanna, I give you platypus eggs,
I give you snake eggs, why, I'll even give you eagle eggs, but I want you to stay away from my...
The eagle's eggs!
That's it!
That's the boy's weak spot!
Push it in a little bit farther, take it back a little bit...
I give up!
I'll never get this. We're doomed!
Doomed!
Hey, look! Krebbs, Frank's out!
Frank, you're free!
Free?
I'm free! I'm free! I'm free!
Shh! Joanna'll hear!
Double or nothing, he's caught in five minutes.
- Calm down, little mate.
- Didn't I tell you?
Look at me, I'm free!
Frank, get the keys.
I should get the keys.
I'm stuck!
Shh! Quiet!
Quiet, you fool!
Take it easy, I'll get you loose.
There you go.
Now go get the keys.
The keys. Yeah, yeah.
Keys, keys, keys.
I can't reach them.
Quick, get something to stand on.
Stand on, something to stand on.
This ought to be rich.
Stand on...
Frank.
Use the box! Climb up on the box!
Of course, a box!
- Quiet!
- These darn things are heavy!
Whoops.
The keys, give us the keys!
Over here! Give us the keys!
Yee-haw! Ride him, Frank!
Yah-hoo! Howdy, howdy!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!
No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!
Huh. Missed.
McLEACH: Surprise!
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you didn't like it here.
Let me go, let go! Let go!
What are you doing out of your cage?
Hmm. That's better.
Come on, boy.
Say goodbye to your little friends.
It's the last you'll ever see of them.
There is no time to waste.
- We must try to get in.
- Here, Miss Bianca, start digging.
Has anyone considered trying, "Open sesame"?
Hey, it worked!
McLEACH: Get out of here! Go on! Get!
Look, Bernard, it's the boy!
And McLeach.
It's all over, boy.
Your bird's dead. Someone shot her.
Shot her, right outta the sky.
No!
What do you mean, no?
You callin' me a liar?
I heard it on the radio.
And she could have been mine if it weren't for you.
Now you better get, before I change my mind.
Go on, get!
- Why is he letting him go?
- It's gotta be a trick.
Too bad about those eggs, eh, Joanna.
They'll never survive without their mother.
Oh, well. Survival of the fittest, I guess.
Bingo!
- Bird?
- Eggs?
Shh. Listen.
I didn't make it all the way through third grade for nothing.
Don't know where he's going, but we can't let him get away.
- Hurry up, you two!
- Quickly, Bernard, now!
Oh, no!
Get between the treads!
Bernard, Bianca, here, catch!
Got it! Miss Bianca, you can do it!
Boy, this is some head wind.
Say, you lovely ladies wouldn't have seen two little mice running around down there, would you?
Hey, where you going?
I mean it, I'm looking for two little mice!
Is it something I said?
He's going down the cliff.
Come on, we gotta warn him.
- Cody.
- Huh?
- Who are you?
- There is no time to explain.
You're in great danger.
Marahute? It can't be!
Cody, wait!
She's alive!
Cody, please! You must listen!
That's right,
McLeach is on the cliff.
Marahute, no! Turn back! Turn back!
Stay away! It's a trap!
I got her! I got her!
Did you see that?
Perfect shot! Perfect shot!
She's mine!
All mine!
No!
Hold tight you two.
We're going for a ride!
- Bianca!
- Bernard!
Meddlin' brat.
Gonna get rid of him for good.
Help, I'm slipping!
Cody, don't move!
There she is, Joanna.
Just look at her.
Look at the size of her.
The rarest bird in the world.
That bird's gonna make me rich.
Filthy rich.
I got what I want.
Now, what does Joanna want?
Does she wanna make sure that bird stays rare?
How about some great, big, triple-A, jumbo eagle eggs?
Huh? You want them?
Huh? You want them? Go get them!
No! Please!
Why, whatever is the matter?
Get moving!
Joanna!
You hurry up and eat those eggs and get your tail up here!
Move it!
Okay, you guys, she fell for it.
Looks like the coast is clear.
Girls? Girls, I'm here!
Where are you, you little chickees, you?
Wilbur?
Wilbur!
Don't ever do that to me again!
Boy, I lost a lot of feathers on that one.
Wilbur, am I glad to see you!
- Help me with these eggs, will you?
- Sure.
Wait a minute, what the heck are you doing up here?
The kidnapper took the boy and Jake. Miss Bianca.
Miss Bianca's in trouble? Whoa!
That's terrible! We gotta do something!
Bernard, I'm disappointed in you.
Hiding under a nest while Bianca needs help.
- I gotta talk to you, mister.
- Wilbur.
You should start searching the desert for her, and I'll scan the coastline!
That's what I'll do.
Ask the chicks on the beach.
What?
Listen! There's some chicks here that need help.
Really?
Oh, no. Wait a minute. Hold it.
I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong. Don't even, no.
Don't look at me!
You're getting "no." Understand?
I will not ever sit on those eggs!
Aw, nuts!
Gotta learn to be more assertive.
No is no is no.
Hey, quit moving in there!
Well, Joanna, it looks like Lady Luck has finally decided to smile on us.
Everything's going our way.
You can't do this!
You're gonna get in big trouble!
I'll tell the rangers where you are!
I almost forgot.
We got a loose end to tie up, haven't we, girl?
Now, now, Cody, we mustn't lose hope.
- Bernard is still out there.
- That's right!
If anyone can get us out of this scrape, it's old Berno!
- Nice bluff, Miss B.
- I wasn't bluffing.
You don't know Bernard like I do.
He'll never give up.
Oh, my gosh!
Uh... Excuse me.
Look, I've got a long way to go, you're going to take me there, and you're not going to give me any trouble, right?
Good.
Now, get!
Are you ready, boy?
It's time you learned how to fish for crocs!
They like it when you use live bait.
And you're as live as they come.
Oh!
You get a line
And I'll get a pole, matey
You get a line
I'll get a pole, friend
Oh, you get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishing in the crocodile hole
Buddy, pal of mine
That's right, babies. Suppertime!
It don't look good, Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one.
Bernard, please hurry!
Now, this is my idea of fun.
Nothing personal, boy, but I wouldn't want to disappoint the rangers.
They was looking so hard for you, and now they're gonna find you!
What the blaze is going on here?
Joanna.
Did you know there was a razorback in my truck? Did ya?
There was a razorback in my truck!
Now you quit playing around and do your job, you four-legged python!
Hey, what happened to them keys?
Must be around here somewhere.
They couldn't just get up and walk away.
Something weird's going on around here. I smell a big, fat rat.
- Look, it's Bernard!
- I don't believe it!
- Way to go, mate!
- Miss Bianca, Jake, catch!
Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
Blast!
Oh, my gosh! I hope I know what I'm doing.
Hey, get off me!
Whoa! Whoa!
Joanna! Joanna!
You stupid lizard! Get off me!
You idiot!
Get off of me!
No! No!
Bernard, the boy!
Help!
Help!
Get back!
Get away. Get away!
I whooped you! I whooped you all!
You'll think twice before messing with Percival C. McLeach!
No!
Don't give up, Cody!
There!
Hop on, Miss B!
Help! Help!
It's okay.
Come on.
Thanks, little mate.
Oh, Bernard, you are magnificent.
You are absolutely the hero of the day.
Miss Bianca, before anything else happens,
- will you marry me?
- Bernard.
Of course, I will!
Well done, mate.
Come on, Marahute, let's all go home.
Help!
Anybody!
Bernard!
Bianca!
Where are you?
Okay, that's it, I'm out of here.
This is ridiculous.
You can't leave me here alone.
I'm gone! I am gone.
No, stay in those eggs!
That's a direct order!
Oh.
Hey, you're kind of a cute little feller. Coochy, coochy...
How do you do?
It's my very pleasant duty to welcome you here... on behalf of Walt Disney,
Leopold Stokowski... and all the other artists and musicians whose combined talents... went into the creation of this new form of entertainment, Fantasia.
What you're going to see... are the designs and pictures and stories... that music inspired in the minds and imaginations... of a group of artists.
In other words, these are not going to be... the interpretations of trained musicians.
Which I think is all to the good.
So now we present... the Tocatta and Fugue in D-Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach... interpreted in pictures by Walt Disney and his associates... and in music by the Philadelphia Orchestra... and its conductor,
Leopold Stokowski.
You know, it's funny how wrong an artist can be about his own work.
Now, the one composition of
Tchaikovsky's that he really detested... was his Nutcracker Suite... which is probably the most popular thing he ever wrote.
Incidentally, you won't see any nutcracker on the screen.
There's nothing left of him but the title.
And now we're going to hear a piece of music that tells a very definite story.
It's a very old story.
One that goes back almost 2,000 years.
A legend about a sorcerer who had an apprentice.
He was a bright young lad very anxious to learn the business.
As a matter of fact, he was a little bit too bright... uh, because he started practising some of the boss's best magic tricks... before learning how to control them.
Mr. Stokowski.
Mr. Stokowski.
My congratulations, sir.
Congratulations to you, Mickey.
Gee, thanks.
Well, so long.
I'll be seein' ya.
Bye.
When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring... his purpose was, in his own words, to ''express primitive life. ''
So Walt Disney and his fellow artists have taken him at his word.
Instead of presenting the ballet in its original form... as a simple series of tribal dances, they have visualized it as a pageant-- as the story of the growth of life on Earth.
It's a coldly accurate reproduction of what science thinks went on... during the first few billion years of this planet's existence.
So now imagine yourselves out in space... billions and billions of years ago... looking down on this lonely, tormented little planet... spinning through an empty sea of nothingness.
Uh, before we get into the second half of the programme...
I'd like to introduce somebody to you-- somebody who's very important to Fantasia.
He's very shy and very retiring.
I just happened to run across him one day at the Disney studios.
But when I did, I realized... that here was not only an indispensable member of the organization... but a screen personality.
And so I'm very happy to have this opportunity to introduce to you... the soundtrack.
Come on. Don't be timid.
That a soundtrack.
Now, watching him, I discovered that every beautiful sound... also creates an equally beautiful picture.
Now, look. Will the soundtrack kindly produce a sound?
Go on, don't be nervous.
Go ahead. Any sound.
Well, that isn't quite what I had in mind.
Uh, suppose we see and hear the harp.
Uh, now one of the strings-- say, the violin.
And now-- now one of the woodwinds-- a flute.
Very pretty.
Now let's have a brass instrument-- the trumpet.
Oh, all right. Now, uh, how about a low instrument-- the bassoon?
Go on. Go on.
Drop the other shoe, will you?
Well, now to finish, suppose we see some of the percussion instruments... beginning with the bass drum.
Thanks a lot, all of ya.
The symphony that Beethoven called the ''Pastoral''... his sixth, is one of the few pieces of music he ever wrote... that tells something like a definite story.
He was a great nature lover, and in this symphony... he paints a musical picture of a day in the country.
Now, of course, the country that Beethoven described... was the countryside with which he was familiar.
But his music covers a much wider field than that... and so Walt Disney has given the ''Pastoral''symphony... a mythological setting.
Now we're going to do one of the most famous and popular ballets... ever written--
''The Dance of the Hours''... from Ponchielli's opera
La Gioconda.
It's a pageant of the hours of the day.
All this takes place in the great hall... with its garden beyond... of the palace of Duke Alvise, a Venetian nobleman.
The last number in our Fantasia programme... is a combination of two pieces of music so utterly different... in construction and mood that they set each other off perfectly.
The first is
''A Night on Bald Mountain''... by one of Russia's greatest composers,
Modeste Mussorgsky.
The second is Franz Schubert's immortal ''Ave Maria. ''
Musically and dramatically, we have here... a picture of the struggle between the profane and the sacred.

Oh! You're not getting cold fins now, are you?
Who, me? No way.
It's just... It, uh...
It looks damp in there. Yeah.
And I think I may be coming down with something.
Yeah, I got this cough.
All right. I'm going inside.
You can just stay here and watch for sharks.
OK.
Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and...
What? Sharks? Ariel!
Ariel, I can't... I mean...
Ariel, help!
- Oh, Flounder.
- Ariel.
Do you really think there might be sharks around here?
Flounder, don't be such a guppy.
I'm not a guppy.
This is great.
I mean, I really love this.
Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around every corner...
Ariel!
Oh, are you OK?
Yeah, sure. No problem. I'm OK.
Shh!
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!
Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Wow! Cool! But, uh, what is it?
I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.
What was that?
Did you hear something?
Mmm? I wonder what this one is.
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?
Nothing is going to happen.
Shark!
Shark! We're gonna die!
Oh, no!
You big bully!

- Whoa!
Mermaid off the port bow!
Ariel, how you doin', kid?
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.
We were in this sunken ship, and it was really creepy...
Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see.
Oh! Oh! Look at this.
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.
Humans use these little babies... to straighten their hair out.
See? Just a little twirl here and a yank there and violee...
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over.
A dinglehopper.
- What about that one?
- Ah!
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!
- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
- Oh!
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day.
Got very boring.
So, they invented this snarfblatt to make fine music.
Allow me.
Music!
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!
Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!
The concert was today?
You could make a little planter out of it.
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!
Any time, sweetie!
Any time.
Yes, hurry home, Princess.
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!
In my day, we had fantastical feasts, when I lived in the palace.
And now look at me.
Wasted away to practically nothing.
Banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish folk celebrate.
Well, I'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough.
Flotsam! Jetsam!
I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.
I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady.
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.
As a result of your careless behavior...
Careless and reckless behavior!
...the entire celebration was, uh...
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!
This concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career.
Now, thanks to you, I am the laughingstock of the entire kingdom!
But it wasn't her fault...
Uh, well, first, uh, the shark chased us.
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to... but we couldn't, and he...
And... And we... Whoa!
And then we were safe.
But then this seagull came, and it was, "This is this..."
Seagull?
What? Oh!
You went up to the surface again, didn't you?
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.
Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?
You could have been seen by one of those barbarians, by one of those humans!
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.
Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.
Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady!
As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!
And I am never... never to hear of you going to the surface again!
Is that clear?
Hmph! Teenagers.
They think they know everything.
You give them an inch, they swim all over you.
Do you think I was too hard on her?
Definitely not.
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.
None of this flitting to the surface and other such nonsense.
No, sir. I'd keep her under tight control.
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.
Ariel needs constant supervision.
Someone to watch over her, to keep her out of trouble.
All the time.
And you are just the crab to do it.
How do I get myself into these situations?
I should be writing symphonies, not tagging along after some headstrong teenager.
Hmm? What is that girl up to?
Huh?
Ariel, are you OK?
If only I could make him understand.
I just don't see things the way he does.
I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.

Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.
We're bein' intrepidaceous.

I've never seen a human this close before.
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?
I don't know. He looks kind of hairy and slobbery to me.

It is now my honor and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present.

Happy birthday, Eric.

It's, uh... It's really somethin'.
Yes, I commissioned it myself.
Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present.
Come on, Grim. Don't start.
You're not still sore because I didn't fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?
Oh, my! Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.
The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled with the right girl.
Oh, she's out there somewhere. I just...
I just haven't found her yet.
Perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
Believe me, Grim, when I find her, I'll know.
Without a doubt, it'll just... bam... hit me, like lightning.
Hurricane a-comin'!
Stand fast! Secure the riggin'!
Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden on the move here! Yo!
Ariel!
Look out!
Grim! Hang on!
Max!
Jump, Max!
Come on, boy! Jump! You can do it, Max!
Eric!
Is he... dead?
It's hard to say.
Oh, I... I can't make out a heartbeat.
No, look! He's breathing.
He's so beautiful.

Ariel dear, time to come out.
You've been in there all morning.
What is with her lately?
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well!
- Oh, she's got it bad.

Ariel's in love.
Ariel? In love?
OK. So far, so good.

But it will not be easy keeping something like this a secret for long.
He loves me.
Mmm. He loves me not.
He loves me! I knew it!
Ariel, stop talking crazy!
I gotta see him again... tonight.
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
- Ariel, please!
Will you get your head out of the clouds and back in the water where it belongs?
I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder will splash around to get his attention.
- And then we'll go...
- Down here is your home!
Ariel, listen to me.

Ariel?
Oh, somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.
Sebastian!
Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you.
I've got an urgent message from the sea king.
The sea king?
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.
Oh, he knows!
Hey, let's see now.
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?
Come in, Sebastian.
I mustn't overreact.
I must remain calm.
Yes?
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.
I'm concerned about Ariel.
Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately?
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.
Daydreaming, singing to herself.
You haven't noticed, hmm?
Oh, well, I...
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?
I know you've been keeping something from me.
Keeping something?
About Ariel?
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?
Humans?
Who said anything about humans?
Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?
Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?
You'll see. It's a surprise.
Oh, Flounder.
Flounder, you're the best!
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.
Why, Eric, run away with you?
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed.
But, Dad, I...
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters incapable of any feeling...
Daddy, I love him!
No! Have you lost your senses completely?
He's a human. You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.
And if this is the only way, so be it!
Daddy! No!
No! Please!
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!
Daddy, no!
Ariel, I...
Just go away.
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.
She has a very serious problem.
If only there were something we could do.
But there is something.
Who... Who are you?
Don't be scared.
We represent someone who can help you.
Someone who can make all your dreams come true.
Just imagine...
You and your prince...
Together forever.
I don't understand.
Ursula has great powers.
The sea witch?
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!
Suit yourself.
It was only a suggestion.
Wait.
Yes?
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.
It was an accident.
Ariel? Where are you going?
Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff?
I'm going to see Ursula.
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.
But... But, I... Come on!
This way.
Come in. Come in, my child.
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.
One might question your upbringing.
Now, then, you're here because you have a thing for this human, this prince fellow.
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?
Well, angelfish, the solution to your problem is simple.
The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.
Can you do that?
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk, like yourself, poor souls with no one else to turn to.

Now, here's the deal.
I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days.
Got that? Three days.
Now, listen, this is important.
Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear old princie to fall in love with you.
That is, he's got to kiss you.
Not just any kiss, the kiss of true love.
If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human permanently.
But if he doesn't, you'll turn back into a mermaid... and... you belong to me!
No, Ariel!
Have we got a deal?
If I become human,
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
That's right!
But you'll have your man.
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
Oh! And there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing.
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.
What I want from you is... your voice.
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.
No more talking, singing. Zip!
But without my voice, how can I...
You'll have your looks, your pretty face.
And don't underestimate the importance of body language!

I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?
Well, look at what the catfish dragged in.
Look at ya. Look at ya.
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?
No? No, huh? Well, let me see.
New seashells?
No new seashells.
I gotta admit I can't put my foot on it right now.
If I stand here long enough...
She's got legs, you idiot!
She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs. Geez, man!
I knew that.
Ariel's been turned into a human.
She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta kiss her.
And she's only got three days!
Just look at her!
On legs! On human legs!
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what her father'd say.
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!
I'm gonna march meself straight home right now and tell him just like I should have done the minute...
And don't you shake your head at me, young lady.
Maybe there's still time.
If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish and just be...
Just be...
Just be miserable for the rest of your life.
All right, all right.
I'll try to help ya find that prince.
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.
If you wanna be a human, the first thing to do is dress like one. Let me see.
Max? What?
Huh? What? Max!
Ya look great, kid.
Ya look sensational.
Max!
Max!
Quiet, Max.
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.
Oh, I see.
Are you OK, miss?
I'm sorry if this knucklehead scared you.
He's harmless really, uh...
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?
We have met. I knew it.
You're the one, the one I've been looking for.
What's your name?
What's wrong? What is it?
You can't speak? Oh!
Oh, then you couldn't be who I thought.
What is it? You're hurt?
No, no. You need help?
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.
Gee, you must have really been through something.
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.
Come on. Come on. You'll be OK.
Washed up from a shipwreck.
Oh, the poor thing.
We'll have you feeling better in no time.
I'll just... I'll just get this washed for you.
Well, you must have at least heard about this girl.
- No!
- Gertrude says...
When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?
- Really.
- Madam, please...
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.
If Eric's looking for a girl,
I know a couple of highly available ones right here.
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.
Nice young ladies just don't swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then flitter off into oblivion...
I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real.
I'm gonna find that girl, and I'm gonna marry her.
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.
Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?
Uh, you look wonderful.
Come, come, come. You must be famished. Let me help you, my dear.
There we go. That's better.
Now, quite comfy, hmm? Ha, ha.
It's not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?
Uh, do you like it?
It is rather a fine one.
Oh, my.
Sorry, Grim.
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.
Ah, very amusing.
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?
Oh, you're gonna love it!

It's not a bad idea, if she's interested.
Well, what do ya say?
Would you like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before this crab wanders off my plate.
Come here, boy.
This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life.
I hope that you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady.
Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you.
Tomorrow when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best.
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.
You gotta pucker up your lips, like this.
Hmm.
You are hopeless, child. You know that?
Completely hopeless.
Any sign of them?
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.
We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian.
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored.
Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.
Yes, sire.
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?
Has he kissed her yet?
- Not yet.
- Oh!
Oh, Judy!
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?
No, not yet.
Well, they'd better get crackin'!
Move over.
Move your big feathers.
I can't see a thing.
Nothing is happening.
Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once.
OK. All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic stimulation.
Stand back!
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!
Wow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
Wa, wa, wa-wa!
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!

A-And she is lovely.

We wish to be married as soon as possible.
Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know.

I saw the... the watch...
The witch was watching the mirror, and she was singin' with a stolen set of pipes.
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?
The prince is marrying the sea witch in disguise!
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?
I mean, when it's important?
What are we gonna do?
Before the sun sets on the third day.
Day...
Ariel, grab onto that.
Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you.
I'll try!
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.
- What about me? What about me?
- You!
Find a way to stall that wedding!
Stall the wedding. W-What am I?
What? That's it!
Let's go!
We got an emergency here.
Dearly beloved...
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.
We're almost there.
Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa... to be your lawfully wedded wife for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
It being... And do you...
Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Then by the power...
Get away, you slimy...
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, why, you little...
Huh?
Ariel?
Eric.
You... You can talk?
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, I wanted to tell you.
Eric, no!
You're too late!
You're too late!
So long, lover boy.
- Ariel!
- Poor little princess.
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!
Why, King Triton!
How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance! She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I...
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!
You see?
The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you.
Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain.
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
Eric, what are you doing?
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!
Now, do we have a deal?
Ha! It's done then!
No! Oh, no!
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
You!
You monster!
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!
After him!
Come on!
Ow!
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.
Babies! My poor little poopsies.
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.
No, I won't leave you.
You pitiful, insignificant fools!
Look out!
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!
The waves obey my every whim!
Eric!
The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!
Eric!
Oh! Oh!
So much for true love!
She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty, children got to be free to lead their own lives.
You always say that?
Then I guess there's just one problem left.
And what's that, Your Majesty?
How much I'm going to miss her.
Ah-ha!
Yes!
Thank you. Thank you.
I love you, Daddy.

Good-bye, Mama.
There are smiles

There are smiles

That kid is too old to be playin' juveniles.
Old but little.
He had a stunted youth.
What is this kid to you anyway, Louie?
He comes in and takes your job away.
And he took Louie everyplace he went.
The kid's nothin' to me.
I'm nothin' to him.
It's more than I got elsewhere.
His voice is changin' anyway.
So let it change.
Who says it's gotta change bad?
Maybe it'll change good.
And the smiles that fill my life with sunshine
Are the smiles that you give
To me
- Louie?
- Yeah?
I'm 17 years old.
When's my voice gonna change already?
It's changin'.
I know it's changin'.
When's it gonna change for good?
- What's your rush?
- I don't wanna be a horse's ass torever.
Almie, what's wrong?
So your voice finally changed, huh?
This is a tunny story.
Yeah, we're both laughin', huh?
That's a nice little cough you have there, Zalmie.
A little cough, says Louie.
Consumption he's got.
You ain't laughin'. Well, you ain't laughin' 'cause I ain't finished yet.
You'll know when I'm finished.
Then you'll be laughin'.
It ya ain't, then I'll be cryin'.
That ought to be good for a few laughs.
Either way, you win!
- Come on. Move.
- Shove it, Charlie.
Hey, hurry up.
Come on. Out on stage.
Move it. Let's go, girls.
I just seen the most beautitul thing
I ever seen in the whole world.
Some pre- Prohibition booze, huh?
No. I seen the stripper gettin' dressed.
A stripper gettin' dressed ain't retty unless she's ugly to begin with.
She was not ugly to begin with!
She was like a rose.
A rose?
- How old are you anyhow, kid?
- Almost 20. How old are you?
Not so old.
I know. When we first met,
I thought you were an old man.
Now, older I get, younger you get.
Amazing, ain't it?
Pretty soon we'll be just the same.
Yeah? Then what?
Then we start callin' me " kid.''
You want this girl, kid?
So go get her.
- Right now?
- Right now.
In this business, you wait tive minutes, she'll be older than both of us. Go on.
Somebody loves me
I wonder who
I wonder who it can be
- Hey, you can sing.
- No, I can't.
Sure you can.
I know voices.
I used to be a singer myself.
- With that voice?
- No, not with this voice.
I used to have another voice. I sent it to the laundry. It come back shrunk.
- So you wanna be a singer, huh?
- No.
Sure you do. Singers get to sit on piano and things.
Strippers is always on their feet.
Ain't you always tellin' me how your tootsies is achin'?
That's because you're always steppin' on 'em.
Hey, kid,
I'm gonna make you a star.
So what was Bella betore it was Bella?
Annabella.
Here.
I wanna make the kid a star.
All right?
To make the kid a star, I gotta get to know the clubs and the bands.
It I can get paid for it at the same time, where's the heartache, huh?
The heartache is, you could have been a star yourselt.
You could have been a great comic.
Who wants to laugh sittin' in some speak?
You got one ear cocked for the cops.
They want a slow, sexy woman... helpin' them to feel sorry for themselves.
Comics are for kids.
And besides, Louie, it's the music I love.
It's the music.
I can't even remember the words.
It's gonna be a big song.
I think you should try it again.
You think I'm gonna be a hit?
Did the booze arrive?
Ah, Mr. Palumbo.
How ya doin', Boss?
Hey, baggy pants.
Where's your partner, Zalmie?
He's in the back where he always is.
Yeah, I see him.
Your girl's getting fat.
Pregnant.
Don't you think it's time for a wedding?
How can I ask her?
I don't have a cent.
You should have thought of that betore you got her regnant.
Who thinks at a time like that?
So what do you think? Customers will pay to see some pufted- out singer?
Hey, she ain't any fatter than Sophie Tucker.
Yeah, but she's tat all in one place.
You want the kid, or you want the girl fixed?
We want the kid!
Well, then, go get married.
This is a wholesome place.
Come on, doll!
We got a down payment on rice!
So the booze I understand.
Izzy needs the booze for the nightclubs.
But why's he cuttin' out the middleman?
He cuttin' the middle out of the middleman.
I never seen so much blood in my whole lite.
I don't like this business.
I loved show business.
Yo always told me it was just the music.
And it still is.
And along came Bill
Who's not the kind at all
You meet him on the street
And never notice him
His warm embrace
His manly grace
Is not the kind
I got to admit it, almie.
She's really good.
What do you say, Nicky?
She ain't bad.
- Sometimes it's all worth it, huh?
- Yeah.
That makes me thrill
I love him
Because he's wonderful
What do you think, Benny?
Your mama's gonna make a record.
The kid never talks, almie.
He will when he's got somethin' to say.
How do you know there ain't somethin' wrong with him?
Maybe he's deat?
How can he be deaf?
He plays the piano.
Beethoven was deat.
See that? Garbo talks, huh?
What?
They won't listen to reason.
Nicky, you get the deuce. Izzy, you pull a trick. The whistler with a jig.
Little almie is flushin' out.
All right.
Hey, that kid's got piano player's hands.
Surgeon's hands.
He's going to be a doctor.
Doctor, piano player. He can be both.
He's smart enough.
Here we go. Everyone in?
Almie, you ordered pretzels?
Pretzels?
Yeah. Thought maybe you sent me a present.
But it's a box of pretzels.
Bella, don't touch the box!
So, Benny, I can get you
Reisenweber's.
I can get you Jack's. I can get you
Shanley's. So what are you doin' here?
I'm happy, Pops.
It's not like anybody's doin' you a favor. Everybody knows you're good.
That guy from RCA Victor is dyin' tor you to make a record tor him.
Dyin'?
It's not that important.
Yeah, Benny, it is important!
You could be somethin', Benny.
You could be a star.
I want you to do me a favor, Benny.
I want you to marry a girl for me.
- Marry a girl?
- Yeah.
- And live happily ever atter?
- Yeah.
Hey, Benny, it's Nicky Palumbo's daughter, all right?
Her father's an important man, mister.
And your tather's an important man, too!
Benny, if you won't live my dreams, then live my life, all right?
Sure, Pops.
Now what are you doing?
Playin' her a love song.
Forget the love songs, Benny.
The girl's agreed.
A love song's nice to give the girl you're gonna marry.
It's very clear
Our love is here to stay
Nicky, look at it this way.
You're not losing a daughter.
You're gaining a son.
Right.
Sons I don't need. I got sons.
What I'm gaining is a brother.
The radio
And the telephone
And the movies
That we know
May be just passing fancies
And in time they'll go
Yet it may be
Our love is here to stay
Together
We're
Going the long, long way
It's a big house.
Big.
What are the two ot us supposed to do in this big house?
Make three, tour or tive.
Is that what you want?
If you do.
But what do you want?
I want you to smile.
Enlisted? What do ya mean, ya enlisted?
- I like the hat, Pops.
- You got a wite now.
You got a kid comin'!
So I need a steady job.
What are you talking?
You got a steady job here!
Oh, Pops.
This isn't work. This is play.
Hey, so play, Benny.
You're just a kid.
No, Pops. No, I'm not.
Look, I gave, all right?
I gave at the ottice.
But you took too.
What am I gonna do it anything should happen to you, huh?
You'II manage, Pops.
Boy, who told you you could play that thing?
Nobody.
Boy, are you lousy.
Yeah.
I know, but it's hard to fit a piano in a foxhole.
You've been carrying a torch tor that bastard's son long enough, ya hear?
You married a good man now, you understand?
You don't want to marry in the business, all right, so I let ya.
You wanna marry a guy that sells refrigerators, I let ya.
Could I be proud of that? No.
But I let ya.
So at least be worthy of the man.
You own him now, Papa!
I own everybody.

I want him to see how a man acts.
What was your relationship with Mr. Palumbo?
My relationship?
- He was my triend.
- Was?
First he told me they'd get me out right away.
Then they told me they'd get me out soon.
Then they told me nothin'.
Eight years is a long time.
I told you we should have gotten rid ot him!
His son gets killed.
He gets totally useless.
But, no, you get mushed tor him.
Let him take a fall, you say, huh?
He'll stay quiet.
Quiet? He would have been a lot quieter dead.
And so now you agreed to talk to us.
This country's been good to me in its way.
"I took," my son said.
So, now it's time to give back.
I can't believe it.
That schmuck is gonna sing!
Sing?
Sure. That's all he ever wanted.
Last night I discussed the Communists in the State Department.
Dean hunched his muscular neck,
T- shirted in the winter night.
We're fighting for time.
The young men in Korea and Japan are fighting for time for us.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have paid their debt to society with their lives.
Pat doesn't have a mink coat... but she does have a respectable
Repblican cloth coat.
Ethel, how could you ever think up a sneaky scheme like that?
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness.
Starving, hysterical, naked, dragging themselves... through the negro streets at dawn lookin' tor an angry fix.
Angel-headed hipsters... burning tor the ancient heavenly connection... to the starry dynamo in the machinery ot night.
Tony, so what's he talkin' about?
Do you have any idea?
Shut up.
Geez, we're underage.
This place could get busted any minute.
And I happen to know some of these people are smokin' drugs.
Shut up!
Instead ot smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water tlats... floating across the tops of cities... contemplating jazz.
- I'm goin', Tony.
- Go.
So how you gonna get home?
Home?

A show? Their brains is tallin' out like teeth.
Did ya get your quarter? Did the brain fairy leave ya a quarter last night?
I'm talkin' to you!
We're ignoring you, Tony.
Mom said to ignore you.
She said you're going through a phase.
A phase? Now I'm a goddamn moon.
That's right! You catch 'em!
Your brains is tallin' out!
Your ears are tallin' oft!
How's your eyes?
Your eyes workin' okay?
Go away, Tony, or we'll call Mom.

He wasn't your tather!
Turn me loose
Turn me loose, I say

And we kiss good night

Canned corn, candy corn... popcorn, Crackerjacks!
You're the prize in my box!
And my box is this country.
It's all tinfoil on the outside.
Corn and sweetness on the inside.
Come wander the country with me.
I can't.
Can't?
Night atter night under the stars.
Did you know them stars travel all the way from here to California?
Clear blue water, white sand.
Are you going to California?

Then this is your night tor Kansas.

Well, you got to be holy
Hey, Di Noble, what are you doin'?

Clean thoughts.

Dirty?
Well, them poor dumb little bastards.
They never learned the power of positive thought.
I thought you said you was a dishwasher.
I'm a dishwasher.
My hands is permanently puckered!
But you know what?
The thrill is gone.
That's what happens when you turn pro.
Even that first batch of suds... that first spraying ot Palmolive over troubled waters... that tirst plunge through the foam... that first hopetul tish for a dish...
It is gone, Charley.
And I think it's time... that I'm movin' on.

Where else can a man go that needs elbow room?
And what the hell you need elbow room tor?
I'm thinkin' ot takin' up the accordion.
Hey, you're not gonna make it in this business, Tony.
Ya can't sing.
You play guitar like a duck.
That's 'cause my hands is permanently puckered!
And, anyway, this is Calitornia.
There ain't no turther west to go.
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A.
California dreamin'
Hey, man!

Don't think twice

Go back to Kansas.
Maybe... you could put some magic on it.
Go back to Kansas.
- I can't.
- Why?
Too tlat.
What the hell is this, the Himalayas?
Everest.
Everybody's gotta take a shot at it.
Gimme your guitar.
You're gonna play it?
No. I'm gonna pawn it.
I'm gonna pawn it, then I'm gonna un-pawn it.
You don't trust me?
Then why do you stay with me?
Why the hell do you think?
Here.
It belonged to my father.
Now I'm givin' it to you.
- Why?
- Why the hell do you think?
His name was Benny Belinsky.
I never knew him.
Supposed to be some kind ot genius or something.
Maybe you take atter him.
Now give me the guitar.
Now you stay right there, you hear?
Till hell freezes over, Tony.
It already did.
Hey, you Little Pete?
Yeah.
Well, I got somethin' tor you.
He said not to sell it all in one place.
And he said to give you this.
Did he tell you anything else?
No... Yeah!
He said to say " Good-bye.''
Hell
Hell is for children
And you know that their little lives can become such a mess
Hell
Hell is for children
And you shouldn't have to pay for your love with your bones and your flesh
Hell is for children
Hell is for hell
Hell is for children
There's no point in asking
You'll get no reply
I'm just getting in bt I barely try
I got no reason to know too much
You'll always find us
Out to lunch
We're so pretty
Oh, so pretty
We're vacant
Don't ask us what we're doin'
'cause we're not aware
I don't pretend

I don't believe illusions
I got too much for real
Stop your cheap comment
'Cause we know what we feel
I know
And we don't care

You'll get no reply
I just get in but I barely try
I got no reason to know too much

Hey, don't wanna hurt yourself.
I was a little too tall
Could have used a few pounds
Tight pants, points
Hardly renown
She was a black-haired beauty with big, dark eyes
And points all her own sittin' way p high
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the backseat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on the night moves
Tryin' to make some front-page drive-in news
Workin' on the night moves
One for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Well, you can knock me down step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But, uh-uh, honey lay off of my shoes
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, yo can do anything but lay off of my blue sede shoes
All right!
Devil with the blue dress on
Crazy
Crazy on you
Let me get crazy on you
Crazy
On you
All right
Let me get crazy on you
[Fievel]
And then the hero, Wylie Burp,
squinted across the dusty street.
Hopelessly surrounded by the Cactus Cat gang, he stood his ground,
refusing to back down.
[Laughing]
Have no fear,
Billy the Kid is here.
It's too tough, kid.
Get out while you can.
If you're biting the dust,
I'm going down with ya.
[Gunshots]
[Yelling]
[Wylie Burp] You saved my life.
I'll never forget this, kid.
Here, son, I want you to have one of these.
Look out behind you.
[Female]
Fievel, your supper's ready.
[Echoing]
Ready, ready, ready.
Ouch!
Fievel!
Fievel!
#Somewhere out there #
# Beneath the pale moonlight #
# Someone's thinking of me #
#And loving me... #
[Splattering]
#And loving me... #
[Splattering]
#And loving me... #
[Man] Shut up!
Papa, they're throwing fruit and vegetables at me again.
Keep singing. Maybe they will throw some fruit for dessert.
Another night without cheese.
Yee-haa!
Howdy, Mama.
I come to rustle me up some grub.
Where have you been,
Fievel? You're late.
I had to rescue
Sheriff Wylie Burp.
He was surrounded by the Cactus Cat gang.
Oh, such a tall tale, Fievel.
And dirty hands too?
Go. Wash.
Oh, Mama, I just washed... yesterday.
I thought things would be better in America.
In Russia, my violins were famous. We never went hungry.
Maybe Tanya should sing again.
Very funny.
You'll see.
Someday I'll be a big star.
People will come from miles around.
Yeah, to eat.
Mama!
Fievel...
[Gasping]
[Grunting]
[Papa] They call America the land of opportunity.
Opportunity for what?
For children to play in the filthy streets?
To never see the sunshine?
Fievel's birthday is coming... and we don't have enough money for presents.
Oh, Papa,
I don't care.
I could sing in front of the gift shop.
- Maybe they'll throw presents.
- [Laughing]
How blessed I am to have such fine children.
Maybe things will get better.
[Crash]
Tiger?
Tiger!
Can we have an espresso and talk this over?
Listen, Tiger. You're an alley cat.
Pretty please.
Born and bred.
How true.
I got a ticket to sunshine and I'm going west.
There's a town that promises a new frontier... and a brand-new breed of cat.
Is there anything wrong with my breed?
City cats got too much purr in their fur.
Not enough growl in their howl.
Look at you.
You catnap, cat around.
Heck, I don't mean to be mean, but you're even a bit of a fraidy cat.
Who told you that?
I'm no fraidy cat.
I'll show you.
I'll show them. I'm no fraidy cat.
Tiger.
I don't want a tomcat, top cat or a tough tabby.
I just want...
How do I say this?
I just want a cat who's more like a dog.
[Neighing]
That's my ride out West.
Show me you're tough.
Don't make a fuss, okay?
[Purring]
You don't mean... this is good-bye?
There are no good-byes between you and me.
After all, we'll always have the Bronx.
Here's looking at you, kid.
The Bronx, that's right.
The Bronx, right.
I won't make a fuss.
I can handle it.
I can...
[Purring]
I can, uh... I can, uh...
[Sobbing]
# [Trombone]
Cat attack!
Cat attack!
[Yelling And Screaming]
Pay attention.
Keep it clean and tidy; plenty of violence, but no eating.
Right.
Carry on, chaps.
[Crying]
[Mama]
Fievel! Fievel!
Get in here with the family!
Oh, no! The mice!
Aw, gee!
[Cackling]
Peekaboo.
[Laughing]
Oh, I got...
I gotta do something.
I will be tough.
I will be brave.
[Tiger]
It's a spy... a spee... a spide... de... de... de... an arachnid!
Aaah!
Why, those no-good ornery varmints.
Fievel, my son.
Come back!
- Oh!
- [Thundering]
- Oh, thank heavens.
- I forgot my hat.
[Wicked Laughter]
[Papa] Fievel, come back.
Hee-ya.
[Papa] Fievel!
Fievel, my son, come back!
[Yelling]
Da...
Da-da!
- Huh?
- [Gasping]
Heh-heh-heh!
Hee-heh-heh!
[Fievel] I see you're missing an eye.
- This makes it a fair fight.
- Yeah?
That's right.
I'm talking to you, fur head.
[Growling]
Fur head?
[Gasping]
I don't care what the boss says.
This mouse is lunch.
Heh-heh-heh- heh!
Run! Run, Fievel!
- Oh, no.
- [Thundering]
[Screeching]
For your life, Fievel, run!
Mama, Tanya, get in!
Fievel!
Papa, get in!
Everybody, together, run!
Run!
Jolly, jolly good.
Now for my part.
Look!
[Screaming]
Aaah!
[Splashing]
[Coughing]
- Let's go on that ride again.
- Where did I get such a son?
[Male]
Why, howdy, fine mice.
I'm in desperate need ofhelp.
I've come into possession of railway tickets to the West.
Tickets to sunshine that I will be unable to use.
Surely there are some of y'all...
looking for a little elbow room, y'all.
Now, I ain't gonna lie.
There are problems out West.
There's a lot of bright sunshine and fresh air.
But after these opulent, aromatic sewers, that might be... upsetting for you all, you all, y'all, sorry.
I'll take one.
I'll take 15.
Hold your horses one minute, y'all.
There's plenty for everyone, yes, sirree.
Are there any cats out West?
There certainly are.
If you have prejudices... against cats you better stay put.
On the frontier cats and mice help each other.
The anointed leader of cats,
Mr. Cat R. Waul, is the most enlightened, intelligent, sophisticated, charming, non-narcissistic, debonair, suave, dashing, renaissance cats you could...
ever wish to meet.
Uh, ah, the fact is, cats even get along with the dogs out there.
Sheriff Wylie Burp is probably the finest...
law-dog in the West, actually, y'all.
Wylie Burp, wow!
Too bad there aren't any desperadoes left to round up. Hee- hee- hee!
- I'll take a ticket.
- Three tickets, please.
Don't push, please.
Plenty for all.
- Three tickets.
- Three for you, jolly good.
Come on, Papa.
Let's go.
There is opportunity out West.
Maybe they have a better appreciation of singers.
So what are we fiddling around here for?
Let's go west!
Jolly, jolly good.
Anybody still like some tickets, y'all?
[Meowing]
[Crash]
[Groaning]
Oh, those nine lives come in handy. Fiev.
[Tiger]
Fievel.
Hello.
Wow, it's empty.
Oh, no.
What's this?
Oh, no!
"Dear Tiger,
We left New York.
"We're taking the train to a town out West called Green River.
"I tried to find you to tell you, but I guess you were somewhere with Miss Kitty.
"I miss you and I hope
I see you again sometime.
Your best friend,
Fievel."
Train, the train!
They're taking the train.
[Mumbling]
[Papa]
Hurry, Mama.
The train won't wait.
I'm sure we forgot something.
Let us see.
We have your violin tools, pots and pans, your pipe, the tail curler, whisker comb... and grandpa's cheese knife.
I hope we have everything.
Don't worry.
It will be wonderful.
[Train Whistle]
[Female]
Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him well.
- [Opera Singing]
- Look, Mama, an actor and a singer.
Tanya, stop that. You shouldn't stare at the less fortunate.
Last call, all passengers bound for Altuna,
Akron, Elkhart,
Oskaloosa and Green River.
Fievel, what is wrong with you?
You should be happy.
We are going west.
I was hoping Tiger would come say good- bye.
Will I ever see him again, Papa?
Who am I to know?
Tiger was a wonderful cat, but he was still a cat.
Someday you will understand.
When, Papa?
When will I understand?
If growing up were easy, would it take so long?
Bye, Tiger, wherever you are.
You're the best cat
I ever met.
[Tiger]
I gotta catch up with that train.
Fievel, wait for me.
Wait for me, please. [Barking]
Oh, dogs, I hate those guys.
[Barking]
[Purring,
Yelling]
[Train Whistle]
Oh, good.
Fievel's train hasn't left yet.
[Growling]
- [Barking]
- I want my mommy.
Uh-oh.
[Yelling]
- Grr!
- [Blowing]
[Pinball Machine Sounds]
[Growling]
[Tiger]
Listen, you guys, be nice.
[Barking]
Oh!
[Barking]
Ah-ha-ha!
Oops!
[Yelling]
[Growling]
Cat got your tongue?
Wait!
That's definitely...
That's my train!
I want it.
Ah-ha-ha!
Please, I'll be good.
I'll always lick.
I'll always cover my...
[Stammering]
I made it.
What a stupid dog.
Na-na-na-na-na-na. Your mother was never housebroken.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Toodle- oo!
[Growling] Hello.
[Yelling]
[Train Whistle]
[Tiger]
Oh, no, not again.
[Barking, Growling]
Dogfish.
[Train Whistle]
Way out West, way out West, way out West, way out West.
[Train]
Way out West, way out West.
[Fievel]
Are we out West yet?
WestJersey, maybe.
# Life in New York City it's full of dread and fuss #
# Our dreams are waiting west there's room for all of us #
#The streets are paved nuggets all of purest gold #
# Soon we'll be millionaires... #
# Boy, have I been told #
[Train Whistle]
# No garbage and no landlord foulin' up the air #
# No crooks or politicians to strip our cupboards bare #
# We'll ride roaring rivers
Turn wilderness to towns #
# Our dreams will take us up and never let us down #
# Way out West there's room for dreamin'#
# There's wide open spaces to see #
# Way out West the sun's always beamin'#
# We'll be everything we can be #
#The nights are filled with dancing lasting 'til the day #
# Days are filled with singing
Work is just like play #
#We'll banjo, fiddle
We'll guitar, spoon #
# Everywhere we go out there we'll play this rousing tune #
# 'Cause way out West we'll build a new nation #
# We'll grow all the way to the sky #
# Way out West there's all of creation #
# We'll do and we'll never say die, yeehaw #
# Way out West we'll build a new nation #
# We'll go all the way to the sky #
# Way out West there's all of creation #
#We'll do and we'll never say die #
Way out West, way out West, way out West, way out West.
[Whimpering]
- Ahh, shut up.
- [Yelling]
Mother always wanted me to be on the stage.
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Cowboy.
You wouldn't be going to Green River, would you?
[Growling]
[Tiger Groaning]
[Train Whistle]
[Mooing]
I know you.
You sold us the tickets.
Hi, my name is Fievel Mousekewitz.
[Gasping]
Heh-heh-heh-heh!
I win again, fathead.
[Male] I say you cheatin'.
You plays your last hand, Chula.
I don't think so.
I got seven more, dog chow.
Why, you dirty, rotten, low-down, double dealing...
I don't get it, boss. How come we're not munching those mice?
Oui. "Zees" fraternity "wiz" mice does run counter to nature.
Which would you rather have, the crouton or the salad?
Of course we will eat the mice,
but only after we have exploited their labors.
[Cat R. Waul]
We are nice to the mice...
because it is intelligent to be so.
If we talk sweetly, they will come in droves.
If we hiss, they will run and we will have to chase them, an unnecessary expenditure of calories.
So when do we take the big bite, boss?
When do we get to eat them?
When, when, when?
When my empire at Green River is complete... and when we have a better mousetrap.
Mouseburgers!
Mouseburgers!
Yes, mouseburgers indeed.
Music... to aid the digestion.
Help!
[Humming]
#[Violin]
Next stop: mouth, throat, stomach,
intestine and, you guessed it,
Green River.
Whoa, oh!
Whoa, whoa, oh!
Uh-oh.
What do we have here?
It appears to be a young pioneer.
The feline in me would like to devour this tender morsel, but the businessman in me knows if I do, the other mice will miss him and come looking.
But the gourmet in me quivers at the thought... of mouse tartar.
But the entrepreneur prefers not to be inundated... by suspicious mice that could jeopardize my plan.
So I must exercise... both willpower and finesse.
Scamper back to your parents, little mouse.
Do be careful.
It's hazardous out there.
- Bye.
- Give him the flying "ahh."
- Make it good.
- I love the flying "ahh"!
[Wicked Laughing]
Mouse overboard!
Where?
What?
I just love the flying "ahh."
- Ahh!
- Fievel!
Fievel, my son.
Don't be a fool,
Mousekewitz!
[Groaning]
[Tiger]
Excuse me. You got a minute?
Are there any rest stops on this trip?
Hey, wait for me.
You can't leave me here.
I burn easily.
I'm... lost, all alone in a million-acre cat box.
Phoo!
[Train Whistle]
[Mama]
My son, Fievel.
[Sniffling]
[Moaning]
You know something?
I think we got snookered.
No, Mama, this is what the land of opportunity looks like... I think.
It feels empty and lonely.
Over here, over here.
Hey, you, this is my place.
This is my place.
Wanna buy it?
[Mama] Papa, quick.
[Papa] All right, we may be slower,
but we are smarter.
All these speedy mices are fighting over the land.
In this dusty country you want to be near the water.
So this is what we left New York for.
This is what we lost Fievel for.
Chula, do this.
Chula, do that.
I'm a good-looking spider, no?
There's lots of women like to marry me.
Mama, Fievel will come.
He's a Mousekewitz.
If we work hard, Green River will be everything we dreamed.
The water, for instance.
In days it will be a beautiful waterfall.
That patch of mud will be a rich field covered with grain.
Prairie dogs will graze on that land, and the city will prosper.
The water.
Without water...
how can we survive?
Please, there's no need for such a bleak assessment of your situation.
After all, what are neighbors for?
A cup of sugar, a saucer of cream.
A pail of water, perhaps.
Water? I'll give 'em water.
[Spitting]
I'd like to share a vision.
A vision of a better world.
My eyes!
A world where cats and mice live and work side by side.
A world where mothers raise their mouselings without fear.
Where musicians receive their proper due.
Where young mousettes fulfill their every, dream.
Will you help me build this world?
[Cheering]
Water,
I need water.
Fievel.
I'm right here.
Mama, I'm coming.
Mama, I'm right here.
Fievel.
Mama, I'm coming.
Mama.
[Echoing]
Fievel.
[Echoing]
Fievel.
Mama! Papa!
Mama.
Yeo-o-o-o-ow!
This is the worst moment of my life.
I wouldn't wish this on a dog.
Maybe a dog.
# Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling #
[Female] Who?
# Oh, my darling... #
# Oh, my darling #
Who?
It's Tiger, your darling.
Don't you recognize me?
- Who?
- It's me, Tiger.
Your darling baby buppie-bunga-boo.
Hey, you're not my darling.
I just kissed an owl.
[Fievel Echoing]
Tiger!
- Fievel?
- Tiger!
Fievel, I've been searching all over for you.
Tiger, is that you?
[Tiger Echoing] Fievel.
Nope, bet it's another mirage.
Fievel, I can't tell you how much...
I wish you weren't a mirage.
Hi, mirage of Tiger.
Hi, mirage of Fievel.
Don't they ever dust this place?
A guy could make a fortune selling... vacuum cleaners.
Dancing buffalo bones.
Naw.
[War Cries]
[Chanting]
Come on, fellows.
I'm a mangy, old cat.
I don't taste good without ketchup.
Ummm. No. No, ma'am.
I'm not your color.
Could we have an espresso and talk this over, please?
How... do you do?
[Speaking In
Mousehican Dialect]
Huh?
Ah.
Hee-hee-hee.

[Chanting]
[Laughing]
They think I'm their Tiger god.
How lucky can you get?
I mean, how did they know I was a vegetarian?
Mm-mm-mm.
[Burping]
It's funny how your appetite perks up when you find out... that you're gonna eat dinner instead of be dinner.
Innkeeper, more wine.
[War Cries]
[Mousehican Dialect]
Shhh!
[Fievel] I said put me down, you ugly furball.
I won't stand for this.
Put me down.
[Clucking]
Uh-oh.
Help!
Water!
Oh, no, I'm in a mouth.
[Screams]
[Coughing,
Gulping]
A little endive went down the wrong tube.
I hope he doesn't throw up.
- Get me out of here!
- Who said that?
[Fievel] Me.
Me, he says.
- Say "ah."
- Ah.
- Tiger!
- Fievel!
I thought I'd never see you.
We waited for you at the station.
Believe me,
I tried to get there, but I was dogged every step of the way.
Oh, Tiger, you're my best friend.
C'mon on, let's go to Green River.
There's something
I forgot to mention.
The only reason I'm not a moccasin right now... is because they think
I'm a god.
This conversation is making me look very ungodlike.
Tiger, listen.
I have to warn my family.
The cats are gonna turn them into mouse... shh!
These folks get offended if you eat and run.
I'll join you as soon as I can.
You promise?
I promise.
Cross my heart and hope to cry.
Oh, Tiger.
I almost forgot.
How do you get to Green River?
Grab a passing sagecoach.
See you later.
Adios.
Sagecoach, get it?
Sage.
Oh, never mind.

I was wondering if you could give me some help.
[Sputtering]
Oh, another tumbleweed asking me for help.
Oh, no, not again.
[Snoring]
Not again.
[Burping]
[Cuckoo Clock]
Mama! Papa! Tanya!
Our Fievel, he's alive.
Fievel, my baby.
He's come back to us.
Mousekewitz, don't let go!
Oh, Fievel.
What happened to you?
I got lost in this desert.
This giant hawk picked me up and dropped me... right on the Mousehican village where Tiger is a god.
Papa,
I have to warn you.
The cats, they're gonna build this giant mousetrap.
They're gonna turn us into mouseburgers!
A giant mousetrap and Tiger is a god?
Fievel's been out in the sun too long.
Mousekewitz!
But Tiger is a god and they are building a giant mousetrap.
Fievel, the only thing that has grown... faster than you are your tall tales.
You will see that out West cats are good.
- [Gasping]
- [Cheering]
- Huh?
- [Muttering]
[Muttering]
So, what's your problem?
Being nice to these mice.
It's driving me nuts!
Get on with it, you morons!
After the saloon is finished tomorrow,
we announce that we are going to have a special ceremony.
We invite all of the mice...
"und" seat them in the stands.
"Und" when the sun goes down...
[Cat R. Waul] Snappo!
- Mouseburgers.
- Mouseburgers!
Let me hear that again.
Mouseburgers!
Let the saliva flow!
Mouseburgers!
[Female]
#La la-la- la-la #

[Yelling]
Terrible, terrible.
Truly, utterly appalling.
I must have a voice to match the opulence of this saloon.
Ooh!
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.
Pussy, pussy, oh, pussy.
Humans, yech!
So shiny and bleah!
Right, I want the subversive... who attempted to assassinate me found.
I love finding subversives.
[Spitting]
What's a subversive?
Someone who doesn't have long to live.
# [Music]
If it isn't my friend from the train.
I heard what you said about mouseburgers.
I'm gonna tell everyone.
I'm gonna get Wylie Burp
'cause he's the law. Wylie Burp?
[Laughing]
That quaint historical figure.
Put simply,
I am the law here.
You're a mere hors d'oeuvre.

This is a diva.
Diva, schmever.
Put a mouse on the stage... and your saloon's gonna be as empty as Death Valley...
on a cold day in June when the snow don't fall.
What?
They'll love her, adore her.
Those who don't will answer to me.
Anything you say, pussypoos.
I have mentioned I dislike being referred to as pussypoos.
Yeah? I'm not so happy about being dumped... in nature's ashtray 500 miles from a pastrami sandwich.
Pussypoos.
I just mentioned, didn't I, that I dislike being referred to as pussypoos.
As for the mousette, I'll get her on the stage for ya.
See that you do.
Farewell, my diva.
- Now then...
- [Gasping]
Don't worry, mousey.
You're safe now.
So you're really not tough and mean like you were acting?
Who, me?
Naw.
I'm soft as this powder puff and twice as gentle.
But living out here around characters like that...
What's your name, honey?
Tanya.
Tanya Mousekewitz.
And you want to be a great singer.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
What's the matter?
You're shaking like a rattlesnake tail.
I'm scared. I've never sang in front of a real audience.
[Crash,
Laughing]
Sweetie, you wouldn't be an artiste... if you weren't nervous.
I'm not pretty.
Says who?
You can be whatever you want if you believe in yourself.
Show me some grit and guts.
Come on, honey.
Give me a smile.
Oh, no, no.
Sweetheart, you can do better than that.
Think of something real nice.
I want you to reach deep down... and find the most beautiful thought that's in your heart.
Oh, beautiful.
Um.
Tonight, Tanya, forget you're in this cowpie hole-of- an-olive-pit town.
You're with your fella at the El Purrocco club.
You're on that stage, and he has a front row seat.
You're singing your heart out just for him.
There are things there
I miss so much.
[Kiss Sound]
I've forgotten why I left.
So much for regrets.
- So, do you like yourself?
- I look like a real lady.
Remember, the real lady is what's under the mask.
Now go knock 'em dead.
[Chula] Oh, dear, oh, dear.
He's not cookin'evenly.
[Humming]
Yeow!
[Cat R. Waul]
Gentle creatures, I have arranged... for a special preview of the artistic virtuosity... that will become of commonplace on this stage.
Allow me to present the divine diva,
Miss Tanya!
[Clapping]
[Cat Laughing]
- I can't do this.
- Sure you can.
If anyone throws so much as a radish at you,
I'll slap 'em so hard their meow'll fall off.
# [Fanfare]
Huh?
Oh.
A mouse!
Throw the mouse out of the house!
# Do you ever miss... #
[Booing]
The boss has hit the catnip again.
What's wrong with the boss?
# Do you ever miss the girl #
# You left behind #
Gosh!
Gosh!
Gosh!
# Is the girl you left behind out there tonight romancin' #
# Makin' eyes at someone else and singin'
Is she dancin' #
[Chula] Come back mouse!
You wouldn't want me to miss dinner!
# Puts teardrops in your eyes from secrets she is keepin' #
I'm blind!
Help, Tanya!
# Have the fiddlers play a tune and dance the night away #
I'm not here, you pointed head.
# You know you'll always miss her #
# Lonely is the lover's heart if only you could kiss her kiss her, kiss her #
Come here!
Come here! Aah!
[Cowboy]
Durn mouse!
Bugger face!
#Just don't leave 'em too darn long,
I think I oughta warn ya #
#Absence makes the heart grow cold and makes a heart to wander #
# If you stay by their side you'll feel their hearts grow fonder #
# Hope you see her someday
Hope I find my way #
# Back to the girl
I left behind #
#Tell me you will never roam #
#We swear we won't go roamin' #
#You'll be by your fireside #
#We'll all be home sweet homin' #
# Kiss her miss her, kiss her #
# Inky-dinky spider caught a mouse in his web #
#The inky-dinky spider bit off the mouse's head #
Hee-hee-hee!
Ow! I'm in pain!
#Where's the girl you left behind #
# She's waitin' for her sister #
#We won't stop until we're home
We'll hug and kiss her #
# I'll find the girl
I'll find the girl #
# I'll find the girl
I'll find the girl I left behind #
#Tonight, tonight, tonight
That's right, all right #
[Applause And Cheering]
Encore, encore!
[Sneezes]
[Cheering]
Tanya, let's get out of here.
I must stay.
My public needs me.
I can't leave you.
It's dangerous.
"Thank you for your... a-du-lation."
Tanya.
[Wylie]
What's the matter, son?
Did you ever know something important but nobody will believe ya?
Boy, I wish
Wylie Burp was here.
You do?
Well, then, he... he... he's right here.
Where?
The old dog's right under your whiskers.
[Snoring]
Read the badge, son.
"Wylie Burp, Sheriff."
Wow!
We need you, Sheriff Burp.
The cats are gonna turn us into mouseburgers. You gotta help us now!
Let this sleepin' dog lie, son.
Doggone it, I'm dog tired. I'm tired of leadin' a dog's life... and fighting like cats and dogs against cats and dogs, and young pups doggin' my trail trying to become top dog.
I'm goin' to the dogs in a dog-eat-dog world, son.
I'm so far over the hill,
I'm on the bottom of the other side.
[Snoring]
But you know,
I think I might be able to help ya.
How? We've only got
'til sundown tomorrow.
Gotta find me a dog.
I'll teach him the stuff.
I'll make a hero out of him.
I don't know any dogs... but I do know a god!
Oh, no, I can't.
You got the wrong cat.
I am a god of eternal peace and cosmic love, my friend.
But why argue?
I'm here, you're here.
We're all here.
But we're going to Green River.
You're going to Green River.
I'm gonna stay right here.
So, you know, give my regards to everybody.
[Purring]
Too bad... because there's a very, very pretty cat there you might remember.
My darling baby bubby-bunka- boo.
[Purring]
Oh.
You convinced me!
What do I gotta do?
Ah, it ain't nothin' much.
You just gotta pretend to be a dog!
A dog!
You got it.
A dog!
Tiger... anyone can be a god, but... it takes grit to be a dog!
So you're the frivolous feline
I've got to whip into shape?
I've got my work cut out for me.
I don't have to listen to this.
I... am a god!
Yeah?
Yeah!
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah! Yeah!
I don't have to listen to this. I'm a god!
Fetch, dog.
- Moi?
- [Snarls]
Aah!
[Humming]
[Giggling]
Hmm.
No, no.
All wrong.
What did I do wrong?
You want me to dribble all over it?
You wanna act like a dog, you gotta think like a dog...
'til you smell like a dog.
No self-respecting dog fetches anything, unless he's good and feels like it.
You wanna intimidate someone, give 'em the la-a-zy eye.
Gee, I'm afraid to ask.
Okay, what's the la- a-zy eye?
The la-a-zy eye!
Wah!
Woof.
Now you do it.
[Grunting]
[Yelling]
Hopeless.
[Grunting]
Now, lemme see you walk.
You're wiggling like a French poodle.
Get down on all fours and get a snoot full of mother earth.
Yuck! That goes against my grain.
Yech!
Roll, you varmint. Roll.
Give yourself a dirt bath.
Now you're gettin' it.
C'mon. We're rootin' for ya.
Get up. Suck in your paunch, boy.
Saunter on out there, one leg in front of the other, slow and easy.
Woosh!
I hurt myself.
If you're gonna act like a dog, you gotta sound like a dog.
Let's hear you bark.
[Sputters]
Well, go ahead.
Bow-wow.
Bow-wow?
It's more like... bark!
Bark.
No, again.
Woof.
Again.
Woof! Rawf!
Raft! Racket!
Rap! Rapscallion!
Rumpelstiltskin!
Redincta gracio, amore!
Oh, this is embarrassing.
Try growling.
Grr!
Grr-rrr.
[Growling]
[Fievel] C'mon, Tiger.
We're running out of time.
Now...
[Roars]
Bark!
[Echoes]
Woof, woof!
[Echoing]
Woof, woof!
Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow.
Ha-ha-ha- ha.
Woof-woof-woof!
Grr!
Grr! Bark, bark!
Bow-wow!
Bark-bark, bark-bark-bark.
Woof-woof-woof.
Bark-bark-bark.
Bark-bark-bark.
Woof-woof-woof.
[Barking Noises]
Woof!
Ten-hut!
Grr.
- [Gasps]
- Who?
[Cat R. Waul]
Jolly good. Now pay attention.
Cats and gentle mice, lend me your ears.
It is my distinguished pleasure to invite all of you... to share our dinner... triumph!
To share our triumph!
Today we herald in a momentous... new feast... ival.
"Feastival..." festival.
To mark this brilliant and illustrious snack occasion,
I will, with these golden scissors, hereby cut the red... ribbon.
[Applause]
Bravo!
[Cheering]
Cat R. Waul, we've come to close you down.
Okay, chaps, it's become necessary to put these dogs... through obedience school.
Kill.
Oh, look out behind you, kid.
Aaah!
Oh, who's that dog down there with Wylie?
He's got some stuff!
Hee-hee-hee-hee!
Ha-ha.
That's Fievel?
It's too tough, kid.
Get out while you still can.
Okay. Toodle-oo.
Hey, Tiger.
Give 'em the la- a-zy eye!
Run for your lives!
Morons.
Trigger the mousetrap!
It's a giant mousetrap!
It's a giant mousetrap!
They're gonna squash the mice!
Now!
[Tanya] # Oh, say, can you see #
- # You're on a mousetrap #
- Stop!
You'll crush the diva!
Flee! Run, run.
Run, every, body.
Run for your lives!
Freeze, you miserable vermin!
[Gunshots]
Run for your lives!
- Yee-haw!
- Aah! Aah!
Now you freeze, cat R. Waul.
Don't pull it, kid, or you've seen the last of Miss Kitty.
Get your hands off me!
Grr... owl!
Help! Help!
[Barking]
- Take that!
- Oh, ho-ho-ho!
I never taught him that one.
[Huffing]
You harm one patch of fur on her and I'll tear you apart, one leg at a time.
[Yelling And
Whimpering]
Aaah!
Ooo.
Okay, Wylie.
- Let 'em rip, kid.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Burp, sir.
[Grunting]
[Screaming]
[Yelling]
And now...
[Growling] revenge!
[Woman]
Oh, pussypoos! Oh, no!
Come to Mommy, darling.
Mommy's going to take care of you for ever and ever... and ever!
[Mice
Indistinct Chatter]
[Cheering]
Papa, Mama!
Fievel, my baby!
Ha-ha! Our Fievel is not so little anymore.
And a regular
Western hero.
Now it's time for music.
Let's celebrate!
# [Square Dance]
[Grunts]
Tiger!
Oh, Tiger.
I never taught him that one.
[Gasps]
Wylie.
[Howling]
Here, son.
I want you to have one of these.
I can't. I'm not a hero like you... well, not really.
Well, maybe not.
Maybe a real hero's the last one to hear about it.
But you pulled me out of a gutter... and for that
I owe you some thanks.
Just remember, Fievel, one man's sunset is another man's dawn.
I don't know what's out there...
beyond those hills, but if you ride yonder, head up, eyes steady, heart open,
I think one day you'll find...
that you're the hero you've been lookin'for.
#I lose my way #
#No one cares #
# The words I say #
#No one hears #
#My life it seems #
#Is a world of dreams #
#Deep in the night #
# You'll find me #
#Dream, and you're right #
#Behind me #
#Stay #
#If you will stay #
# We'll dream the night away #
#Dreams to dream #
#In the dark of the night #
# When the world goes wrong #
#I can still make it right #
#I can see so far in my dreams #
#I'll follow my dreams #
# Until they come true #
# There is a star #
# Waiting to guide us #
#Shining inside us #
# When we close our eyes #
# Come with me #
# You will see what I mean #
# There's a world inside #
#No one else ever sees #
# You will go so far #
#In my dreams #
#Somewhere in my dreams #
# Your dreams will come true #
#Don't let go #
#If you stay close to me #
#In my dreams tonight #

Now, it's always
once upon a time
in New York City
It's a big old, bad old
Tough old town it's true
But beginnings
are contagious there
They're always
settin'stages there
They're always turnin'
pages there for you.
Ain't it great the
way it all begins
- In New York City
- Let me have one. Please.
Right away
you're makin'time
And makin'friends.
No one cares
where you were yesterday
If they pick you out
you're on your way
To a once upon a time
That never ends
So, Oliver
don't be shy
Get out there
and go and try
Believin'that
you're the guy
They're dyin'to see
'Cause a dream's no crime
Now, once upon a time
Once upon a time
in New York City
If it's always
once upon a time
in New York City
Why does nightfall find
ya feelin'so alone
How could anyone
stay starry-eyed
When it's rainin'
cats and dogs outside
And the rain is saying
"Now you're on your own"
So, Oliver
don't be scared
Though yesterday
no one cared
They're gettin'
your place prepared
Where you wanna be
Keep your dream alive
Dreamin'is still
how the strong survive
Once upon a time
in New York City
Keep your dream alive
Dreamin'is still
how the strong survive
Once upon a time
in New York City
Keep your dream alive
Dreamin'is still
how the strong survive
Once upon a time
in New York City
And it's always
once upon a time
in New York City
- Forty seconds.
- All right. Here we go.
You see the feet walkin'down
the street in the fast lane
Walkin'on the street
Where they goin'
Just makin'a move
Tryin'to survive
Find a way or not
to stay alive
Cool cat in a cruel world knows
good from bad his mind is in a twirl
Got to look out
and open your eyes
And if you're in a jam
You got to realize
You're in the fast lane
Wait, wait, wait
Wait a minute
- In the fast lane
- Wait, wait, wait
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.
Come on, sweetheart.
We're late.
You can play with the kitty some other time, honey. Come on.
Hey, 'scusa me. Don't you see
I'm pushing something here? Thank you.
Hey, come on, folks. Step right up. Get your hot dogs.
The best hot dogs in New York.
Hey, it's a beautiful day, eh?
Come on, folks. Step right up.
Hey. Go on. Get outta here.
Shoo! Get outta here. Go on, kitty.
Get your sausages. All right, let's go, folks.
Step right up. I got the hottest dogs in the Big Apple!
- Hiya.
- Ah... Hmph!
- Ooh. La-de-dah.
- Hey! Hey, get off of me.
- What's the matter with you?
Hey! I said get outta here.
- Well, well.
Looks like Louie's got a visitor.
Could be time for the Dodge to turn this into a total cat-astrophe.
Hey! Get off me! Hey!
Get outta here. Go on! Shoo!
Ooh, you sure picked the wrong guy to get hot dogs from, kid.
- G-Get away from me!
- Whoa! Chill out, man!
I don't eat cats.
It's too much fur.
I've been watching you, and I think you're in serious need of some professional guidance.
Now what do ya say we team up and change old Louie's mind... about sharin' some of those hot dogs?
I'm not goin' back there again.
Hey. Be a snap, kid.
I'm an expert at these things.
All you gotta do is learn some moves.
- Moves?
- You know. Tempo.
Ooo-cha-ba. A rhythm. This city's got a beat. You gotta hook into it.
And once you got the beat, you can do anything.
- I can?
- "Absitively posolutely."
The man you see before you is affectionately known as "Old Louie."
A well-known enemy of the four-legged world.
Our mission, cat, is to liberate those all-beef kosher franks and hightail it outta here.
- Startin' to feel that rhythm?
- Well, uh...
Yeah! Yeah! I do feel it!
- When are we gonna get those hot dogs?
- Right now.
Hey! Dog!
Hey! Get outta here, you... Hey!
Hey! Hey! Get outta there! I'll get you!
Go on! Get outta here!
Hey, you really got that rhythm, kid.
Uh, yeah?
We were good, huh?
So when are we gonna eat?
- We?
- Yeah. I'm starvin'.
Listen, kid.
I hate to break it to ya,
- but the dynamic duo is now the dynamic uno.
- What do ya mean?
What I mean is, our partnership is herewith dissolved.
But wait! Wait.
You're not being fair.
Fairs are for tourists, kid. Consider it a free lesson in street savoir faire... from New York's coolest quadruped. Check ya later.
Hey, wait! I helped you get those.
Half of those are mine!
Ya want 'em?
Come and get 'em.
- Uh-huh
- But I'm warnin' ya, kid.
One minute
I'm in Central Park
- Then I'm down on Delancey Street
- What the... Hey!
Say, from the Bowery
to St. Mark's, huh
There's a syncopated beat
Like, I said
Woo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-oo
I'm street wise
I can improvise
Said, ooo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
I'm street smart
I've got New York City heart
Why should I worry
Why should I care
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoir faire
Why should I worry
Why should I care
It's just a be-bopulation
I got street savoir faire
Mm-hmm
The rhythm of the city
Boy, once you get it down
Said, you can own this town
You can wear the crown
Why should I worry
Tell me, why should I care
Say, I may not
have a dime
Oh, but I got
street savoir faire
Why should I worry
Why should I care
It's just a doo-wopulation
and I got street savoir faire
Everything goes
Everything fits
They love me at the Chelsea
They adore me at the Ritz
Why should I worry
Why should I care
And even when
I cross that line
I got street savoir faire
Woo-hoo-oo
Hoo-hoo
- Said, ooo-ooo, woo-hoo-oo
- Whoa! Come back here, boy.
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Now, come on. Where are you goin'?
Where are you goin'?
Come on, come on. No, no!
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Wooo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Huh?
Tito, stop that racket.
I'm trying to watch this show.
There would have been
a time for such a word.
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow,
and tomorrow creeps...
in this petty pace from
day to day, and all...
- our yesterdays have lighted
fools the way to dusty death.
- Hey, Frankie, man. Whatcha watchin', man?
Hey, does he get the girl?
I mean, what happens?
- Shut up, you little rodent.
- Hey, man, this stuff is boring, man.
Come on. Let's watch some boxing, man.
I want to see some action.
Hey, Frankie. ż Qué pasó, man?
You're getting slow, man.
My name is Francis.
Fran-cis. Not Frank.
Not Frankie. Francis.
No kidding, man? Hey, so what did you bring in today, "Frahn-cees"?
- It's none of your business, you intrusive little pipsqueak.
- Look what I got.
Oh, good show, Einstein. Now all we need is the court and the net.
You think this place is big enough?
Hey, come on. What we need is some good quality stuff, man.
- Check it out.
- Oh, shredded leather.
Shredded wha... What you talkin' about, man? That's a primo wallet, man.
- Rubbish, you mean.
- All right, that does it, Frankie, man!
You insulted my pride!
That means death!
- Behold. The runt of the litter.
- Frankie! Frankie, Frankie,
- Cut it out,
- you two.
- Frankie, Frankie, Frankie!
Fagin's not gonna be too happy about this. So, Francis, you got the food, right?
- Uh, well, no. l...
- Whoa,
- Frankie. It was your turn to get the food today.
- Frankie!
- Oh, Frankie!
It's newspaper burritos again!
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Cool it, Dodger fans.
I'd like to introduce you to your dinner.
- Hot dogs, ŕ la Dodger.
- Hot dogs! All right, Dodger man!
You remain our preeminent benefactor.
Yeah. And you're okay, too.
So how'd ya do it this time, Dodgie baby?
Lemme tell ya, Rita. It was tough.
Only I could have done it.
Did you have to fight, man?
Huh? Huh? I mean, did you fight?
- I mean, how many were there, man?
- Picture the city.
8th and Broadway.
The crowds hustling.
The traffic roaring.
The hot dogs are sizzling.
I love a story with food in it.
Enter Dodger.
One bad puppy.
Not just out for himself; but community-minded.
But he's not the only one out there.
Enter the opposition.
A greedy, ugly, psychotic monster... with razor-sharp claws, dripping fangs, and nine lives, all of them hungry.
He comes at me, eyes burning.
I knew my time had come.
- Suddenly...
- Gang war! Gang war!
- Watch out! Here comes a gang war!
- Take cover!
Guys, okay, watch out!
Well? What is it?
Hey, man, check it out, huh?
Ay, it's a alien!
Cool it, guys.
It's just a cat.
Now, how'd you find this place, cat? l... l... I followed this dog.
- He's lyin'! He's lyin'!
He's lyin'! He's lyin'!
- Shut up, Tito.
- Why would a cat follow a dog?
- Yeah. l-I just wanted some of the sausage that I helped him get.
He's a spy, man. Come on, let's eat him.
You're dead meat, kitty.
I me... S...
I saw him come down.
Hey! That's... Hey, that's him! O-Over there!
Hey, kitty, what took you so long?
Relax, kid.
Dodger, razor-sharp claws?
- Dripping fangs?
- I kind of like those burning eyes.
Hey, keep it down, guys. The game's on.
Oh, boy, Dodger. Top dog has to get help from a cat.
Hey, Tito, cool it, man.
- Come on. Let's see this big, bad kitty fight in action.
- Hey, Tito, look!
Oh, boy! Dog pile!
Oh, what a bunch of overgrown...
- Get off.
- All right. That's it.
Quit biting.
All right, all right, knock it off! Enough!
What's the matter with you guys?
Don't you understand? Sykes will be here any minute, and I don't have his m...
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no. Stop it.
No. No.
No licking.
What a joke! All right, settle down. It's Sykes!
All right, all right.
I'm coming.
I'll be right there. You guys, listen. Don't let me down.
Whaddya got?
Let's see what you got.
It's worthless!
What have you done?
Oh, how are we ever going to pay Sykes off with a... a pussycat?
Oh. Look who's here, kids.
Company. Nice doggies.
I was just on my way out.
You guys miss us?
Mr Sykes, I, uh... l... l...
He's gonna kill me.
Oh! Hello.
Oh, lovely evening.
I was just saying this to your two lovely,
- purebred Dobermans.
- The money, Fagin.
Actually, I've got something much better than money.
Some luxury items that should make a considerable dent in my debt to you.
Oh, my! You waxed your car, didn't you?
Uh, did they use the buffer on this, because I can see myself.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I don't want your garbage, Fagin!
Oh, please, Sykes. Oh, please.
Oh, please, I beg you.
I don't think you grasp... the severity of the situation.
Oh, no! Oh, no, no!
I did grasp it.
This is how I grasp. Look.
Accident.
Accident!
- Mr Fagin!
- Sorry.
Now, I lent you money and I don't see it.
Do you know what happens when
I don't see my money, Fagin?
People get hurt.
People like you get hurt.
Do I make myself clear?
Clear. Perfectly clear.
Ya know, Rita,
I can't figure out... why you'd rather hang around a dump like this... when you could be living uptown with a class act like myself.
Isn't it rather dangerous to use one's entire vocabulary in a single sentence?
Hey, Frankie, get down, brother. You bad, man.
- Hey, you got something to say to me, fat boy?
- We... Eh, a-actually...
Come on, man. You guys don't scare me.
Come on. I'll kill you both, man.
Come on, let me at 'em!
I'll kill 'em, I'll kill 'em! Come on!
Go ahead. Let him go.
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
- Like you, old man?
- Hey, Roscoe.
Roscoe, is this us losing our sense of humour?
Nah. I ain't lost my sense of humour.
See? I find that funny.
Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please!
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.
Three days, Fagin.
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.
Three days. Three, three, three. That's nine.
- Nine?
- No, Fagin.
- Three.
- Three!
Oh, you mean, just three days?
Oh, my goodness! Oh!
Oh, I'm having a bad day!
Hey, hey, Roscoe.
Look what I found.
Forget it, DeSoto.
We gotta go.
I like cats.
I like to eat 'em.
Get out of my way, Dodger.
That's enough, Roscoe.
Run along, Roscoe.
Your master's calling.
No.
Come on, DeSoto.
We ain't finished, Dodger.
You guys are gonna pay for this.
Starting with that cat.
Oh, yeah! You guys don't scare me!
Come on back and say it to my face!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Yeah, those creeps'll think twice before hassling us, man.
All right, kid.
What'd I tell you guys?
OI' Dodge can really pick 'em, huh?
Ooh, three days.
How am I ever gonna come up with all that money?
What's the use? I'll never get out from under that maniac.
My days are numbered.
And the number is three.
It's hopeless.
Thanks, guys.
That reminds me. I saw
DeSoto's nose. Who did that?
You? You.
That took a lot of guts.
We've never had a cat in the gang before.
We can use all the help we can get.
All right. Time for bed.
We've got a big day tomorrow.
Aww, no. No.
Oh, all right.
But just one chapter tonight.
Umm, let's see.
Here we are. Here we are. Chapter seven.
"Sparky stopped and he rolled in a field of wild flowers.
"The dandelions tickled his nose till he laughed out loud.
"And then, something caught his eye.
"It was Bumper the rabbit.
Sparky jumped to his feet and ran toward Bumper, barking loudly."
Woof. Woof.
Well, you try it sometime.
Well, that's because you're a dog.
"Sparky knew that Bumper would run and that he could chase him over the field.
But Sparky would never catch him or hurt him because Sparky was not that kind of dog."
This is the big one.
We've got two days to do or die.
Dodger, you keep an eye on the new kid. Show him the ropes.
I don't want to put any undue pressure on you, but, but... as you march off to do your duty,
I want you to keep one thing in mind:
Dead men do not buy dog food!
So, big smiles and get out there... and fetch!
All right, if Mr Sykes don't see some cold, hard cash soon, we are Doberman chow. Come on.
We'll start on
Columbus Avenue.
- What kind of work do we do, anyway?
- Investment banking, man.
Didn't you read about us in the Wall Street Journal?
- Really?
- Yes. Captains of industry.
Gosh. Can I be one too?
- Hey. When you got your pals, you got all you need.
- Okay, Dodge.
We gotta clean you up, child, and give you some on-the-job training.
Ooo, yeah
Now listen up
You got a lot to learn
And if you don't learn
you don't eat
But if you're tough
and always use your head
You'll be right at home
on the street
When you got talent
everything is free
Watch how we do things
Ooo, I guarantee
You're gonna see how
the best survive
We make an art out
of staying alive
If you do just
as you're told
These are
streets of gold
Every boulevard is
a miracle mile
You'll take the town and
you'll take it with style
If you play it
brave and bold
These are streets of gold
Hello. What have we here?
All right! A chauffeur shuffle.
- Listen up. Einstein, give me a fender bender at two lights.
- Yeah.
Tito? You're in charge of electronics.
Rita and I'll work the crowd. Francis?
I know. My public awaits.
- Hey, but what about me? What do I do?
- You help Tito.
All right! Come on, gato. Hey,
Uncle Tito will show you how it's done.
- Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on!
- Ready? Go!
Oh, Winston, listen to this.
"After a little sightseeing, we left Paris by car... for the con... confer-er..."
- Conference, Jennifer.
- Oh, yes. Conference.
"in-in Rome on Wednesday.
Jenny, I'm afraid your father and I won't be able to make it..."
Is there anything wrong, Jenny?
- Are your parents all right?
- They're staying longer.
Oh, don't worry. Um... l-I'm sure they'll be home for your birthday.
No.
- Oh!
- What was that?
I d... I don't know. But, uh, now, do-don't be alarmed.
- I'll be right back.
- Run, Sparky. Go find Bumper.
Why me?
Today of all days.
Hey. Check it out, man. Beep beep.
Hey, Forget Fagin, man.
Let's take this baby to Atlantic City.
What have I done?
Poor thing.
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
- l-l-I'm sure he's just fine.
- Harming that...
- poor animal.
- Probably just a little stunned.
Run along, little fellow.
Go on, now. Shoo.
- Hey, hey, Tito. What can I do?
- Well, uh...
Why don't you be a lookout, man? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. Be a lookout.
Okay. Uh, what is a lookout?
Look, j-just look out the window.
Make sure it's still daylight, okay?
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Tito. Tito, there's somethin' back there.
Hey, stop hasslin' me, man.
I only got one more wire, okay?
But... B-But... Oh!
What's going on here?
Let's get outta here!
Oh, you poor kitty.
Here. Let me help you.
Na... Jenny are you all right?
Where's the kid?
He must still be in the car, man!
- Oh, that poor little kid.
- You were supposed to keep an eye on him, Tito!
Yeah, well, it's hard to watch anything when you're gettin' barbecued, man.
- What are we gonna do, Dodge?
- Tito, come with me.
The rest of you, we...
Get back to Fagin.
Now, really, Jenny. W-We-We can't just take in a stray off the street.
But look at the poor thing.
Winston, he's half-starved.
I know you're growing attached to the little fellow, but t... do try to understand.
Your parents left me responsible for you.
They won't mind.
Really.
Don't worry, kitty.
I'll take care of you.
Georgette is not going to like this.
Rise and shine, Georgette.
Your public awaits.
Girl, we got work to do
Pass me the paint
And glue
Perfect isn't easy
But it's
Me
When one knows
the world is watching
One does what one must
Some minor adjustments, darling
Not for my vanity
But for humanity
Each little step
a pose
See how the breeding shows
Sometimes it's too much
For even me
But when all the world says yes
Then who am I to say no
Don't ask a mutt to strut
like a showgirl
No, girl, ya need a pro
Not a flea or a flaw
Take a peek at that paw
La-de-da-da
Perfection becomes me n'est-ce pas?
Unrivalled
Unruffled
I'm beauty unleashed
Yeah
Jaws drop
Hearts stop
So classic and classy
We're not talkin'Lassie
And Aaa
Aaa
Ooo
Ooo
Though many covet
my bone and bowl
They're barkin'up
the wrong tree
You pretty pups
all over the city
I have your hearts
and you have my pity
Pretty is nice
but still it's just pretty
Perfect, my dears
Is me
Wait till you taste this.
It's a secret recipe
I just invented.
What on earth?
My goodness! Jenny!
D-Don't you think a tin of kitty chow would have sufficed?
Nonsense. He'll love this.
Eh, now, young lady.
D... I really think we should've waited until your parents...
- Oh, bother!
- And for ze kitty, the house specialty.
Oeufs a la Jenny
avant Cocoa Krispies.
- Jenny! It's your parents!
- Yeah! Wait till I tell 'em!
Oh, yes, sir. I do assure you, everything is absolutely hunky...
Georgette, I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
- Uh, everything's fine here, sir.
- They're gonna be so excited.
H-Here she is now.
A cat! What is the meaning of this?
Winston!
I guess I'll have to handle this myself.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I, um, hope you won't think me rude, but do you happen to know... out of whose bowl you're eating?
- Yours?
- Ooh.
Aren't you a clever kitty?
And do you have any idea whose home this is?
I thought it was Jenny's.
Well, it may be
Jenny's house, but everything from the doorknobs down is mine!
Oh, Georgette! I see you met
Oliver. Isn't he cute?
I've got great news. Mom and Dad just said I could keep him.
I'm sure you two are gonna be the best of friends.
- Now, for $ 200...
- Where's the kid?
We tailed him all the way up the park.
- We never had a chance.
- You should see this place, man.
There's gotta be, maybe
200 people livin' there.
You guys, we can't let the kid take the heat for us.
Yeah, man. If we don't get him, they're gonna torture that kid.
- What in heaven's name are we waiting for?
- But what about Fagin?
Alas, our beleaguered benefactor, bearing the brunt of our futile endeavours.
Gimme a break. Speak
English, Frankie.
- Francis. Francis. Francis!
- All right, cool it!
Now, we got work to do.
First, we'll spring the kid.
Then, we'll take care of the old man. All right?
Yeah, that's right, man!
He's family. He's blood.
- Hear! Hear!
- Okay, troops. Our mission begins at daybreak.
Einstein, go up to the door.
Francis, you're our...
Oh, Jennifer. I don't hear any practising.
All right, Winston.
I gotta practise now, kitty.
Oh-ho, you wanna practise too.
You and me together
Will be forever
You'll see
We two can be
good company
You and me
Yes, together we two
Together, that's you
Forever with me
We'll always be
good company
You and me
Yes, together we'll be
You and me together
Will be forever
You'll see
We'll always
Be good company
You and me
Just wait
And see
Good night, Oliver.
Bye, Winston.
Goodbye, Oliver.
Hi, Jenny.
Sit over here.
All right, listen up. We checked it out. All we gotta do is...
Oh, man! He's dead meat now.
I'll handle that ruffian.
- Hurricane Gilbert takes a blow!
- Body slam! Body slam!
Oh, come on, you fool!
Hit him! Hit him!
Oh, bother.
Einy.
- Get outta there!
- Huh?
Yes? Who is it?
Oh, my.
You! Put the...
I'll show you, you...
Come back here!
What...
Mira lo this place.
Check it out.
Chagall. Matisse.
These are all masterpieces.
Huh. This place looks pretty nice.
I mean, how bad off could it be here?
Hey, man, if this is torture, chain me to the wall.
Tito!
We're here for the kid, remember?
Now, let's get him and go.
"I love you, Oliver.
Play with Georgette."
I'd like to play with him, all right! The little fur ball!
Ooh.
Who are you?
What do you want?
- Winston!
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down.
Don't come any closer! I knew this would happen one day.
You're barkin' up the wrong tree. It's not you I'm after.
It's not? It's not?
Well, why not?
What's the problem, Spot?
Not good enough for you?
I mean, do you even know who I am?
Fifty-six blue ribbons.
Fourteen regional trophies.
Six-time national champion!
Ooh, and we're all very impressed, right, guys?
Very impressed.
Oh!
Allow me to introduce myself. I am
Ignacio Alonzo Julio Federico de Tito.
Get away from me, you little bug-eyed creep!
Winston!
- Excuse me, uh, sister. Who's Rex?
- None of your business!
And you, tubby, off the bed!
Get away from there, you...
All right, that does it!
You yo-yo's clear out and I mean now!
Winston!
Relax, champ. We'll leave as soon as we get our cat.
If you think I'm intimidated by a bunch of flea-bitten, dog-pound rejects...
Your cat?
How stupid of me. You must be the friends he keeps talking about.
- Yes.
- Georgette?
Something's not quite right here.
Quick. Before he comes back. Follow me.
Look at him, Dodger.
Honey, let's just forget the whole thing.
No, no, you can't do that!
You don't understand.
- The poor dear's so traumatized.
- Georgette.
- Huh? What?
- What is going on here?
Now get goin'. Hurry.
Use the fire escape.
Hey, there's no time for long goodbyes, but here's something to remember me by, baby.
Ooh, I think she likes me, man.
Ooo, I could've danced all night
I could've danced all night
- You were very good. Nice job, Dodger.
- W-What? What? Hey, wait.
- What's goin' on, you guys?
- It was just the rescue of the century.
- Res-Rescue?
- Should've seen Frankie handle that butler, man.
I was rather good, wasn't I?
And how about Tito and
Miss Six-Time National Champion?
Hey, hey, but wait. l-l-I don't understand you guys.
- Hey. You okay, kid?
- Yeah, I'm fine, bu...
Hey, sure he is! He's back with his Uncle Tito. l-l-I was happy there.
Why did you guys take me away?
We rescued you, kitty.
I mean, we brought you home.
But... Well, I, I have another home now.
And someone who loves me.
What do you mean, kid?
You're in the gang.
- But, but...
- The gang means family.
We risked a lot to get you outta there.
Look, I'm sorry, but all
I ever wanted was, was like...
Wha-What? This place is not good enough for you any more? Don't wanna mix with the riffraff?
No, no. I like you.
I mean, I li... I li... I like every-every one of you, but...
But there was a little girl.
I just wanna go back.
We never shoulda took him, Dodger.
- Dodger, please...
- You wanna leave? Fine.
There's the door.
- But he just got here.
- Go on. No one's stoppin' ya.
Hey, uh, Dodger, man, uh, lighten up.
You lighten up! If he doesn't like it, let him go.
Oh, it's hopeless.
Oh.
What's this?
So that's where you've been!
Looks like you're doing all right for yourself, Oliver.
Your owner probably spends more money on catnip... than we do on food in a month.
He's probably worried sick about you.
All alone in that big house with only his money to comfort him.
Only his millions and millions of dollars to...
That's it!
We're saved!
What a plan!
Ah, yes!
Paper! Paper!
Whoo, it's so great.
Dear Mister Rich...
Mister Very Rich...
- Bye, Jenny!
- Oliver!
Oliver?
Oliver!
- Feel it. Make your body work.
That's it. Very good.
- Oliver!
- Oliver!
- Two, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Oh, you love it!
Oliver, I'm home.
That's funny.
Georgette, help me find Oliver.
Oliver! Oliver!
Oh, where could he be?
Oliver?
He's not here.
Where is he? Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
"Dear Mr Very Rich
Cat-owner Person."
Whoops.
"And if you don't bring the money, you'll never see your cat again."
Oh, no. Georgette, something terrible has happened.
They've kidnapped Oliver.
Oh, Georgette.
You loved him too.
Don't worry.
We're going to get him back.
This is an airtight plan, Sykes.
Sweet and simple.
I ransom the kitty, and you get paid in full tomorrow.
I'll even toss in a little extra for your patience.
What do you say? It's my final offer. Take it or leave it.
- Yeah, who is it?
- Oh.
Fagin, it's you.
Why didn't you say so?
Oh, good question!
But listen. If you're busy, we can drop by some other time.
Don't be silly.
Just push the door.
I said, push!
What do you mean?
You start with the knuckles.
Ah, Fagin. Do come in.
I'll be right with you.
Yeah. No, you don't kill him yet.
Yeah.
And then? What's-What's the last thing you do? You put on the cement shoes.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Come on. Hey, don't worry about it.
So, Fagin.
- Did we bring something green and wrinkly to make me happy?
- Sykes,
I've got an airtight k-kitty... plan, plan!
It's sweet and simple, the plan.
- Let's just take this from the top.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
What... What am I gonna do with you, Fagin?
- I've got this kitty, you see.
- Fagin.
You don't got the money.
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no! Stop!
Please, Sykes, please! Sykes,
I'm getting your money tonight! It's coming tonight!
Please, it's from a rich cat. No, I mean a cat from a rich family. Please, don't!
They're coming tonight with the money
I owe you, uh, to get the cat back.
Hey, I think there's hope for you yet.
I'm proud of you, Fagin.
Yeah, you're startin' to think big.
You've got 12 hours.
And, Fagin, this is your last chance.
Turn left right when you get to the big propeller.
Oh, Georgette, I can't read this!
It says... No, that...
No, that's not right. It's left.
Oh, Georgette, where are we?
I think we're lost.
Stay close, Georgette.
It's creepy down here.
He's late. I drew a perfectly good map.
Well, there was a few smudges on it, okay.
I went outside the line with the green crayon, but not that much.
- Oh, Dodge.
- A child could read that map.
- Hey, Rita.
- They never laid a paw on me.
- Ooh, wait!
- What if he comes, and he's huge and mean?
- Excuse me, sir.
It's the FBI! I didn't do it!
I didn't do it! I was framed.
Listen, little girl, this is a tough neighbourhood. You'd better go home.
I can't. I'm lost.
Aw, gee. Lost. Well, I'd help you, but I'm kind of busy right now.
- What are you doing down here, anyway?
- I came to find my kitty.
- Your kitty?
- Somebody stole him.
- But-But, uh, are you sure? Maybe you made a m... a m... a mistake. Maybe...
- No.
- No, somebody stole him and sent me this note. See? I'm lost.
- Easy, boys.
Look, I even brought this to get him back.
- You brought a piggy bank.
- It's all I have.
- That's awful.
- I know.
And what kind of a person would steal a poor little kitty?
But l... I mean, maybe he...
Maybe he was up against a wall, at the end of his rope.
- He must have been a poor, desperate man.
- It's still wrong.
And I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
Neither do I.
Hey, guess what?
I found a little lost kitten. l-I don't know.
Take a look. Maybe he's yours.
Oliver! Oliver! Oh, my Oliver!
Sykes. Sykes!
I was gonna...
- Hey! Hey, wait! What are you doing?
- Let go.
No! No, wait! You can't do this!
Keep your mouth shut. We'll consider our account closed.
Stop! Stop! Time out!
- Time out! Oh, please!
- Wha... What happened?
- Sykes!
- You okay, kid?
- Jenny? He took Jenny!
Don't worry.
We'll get her back.
- You... You will?
- Hey, "absitively," kid.
Come on, man, let's go! Come on!
- Man, let's get him, man!
- All right. Let's do it.
Wait, wait! Come back!
Stay. Sit. Wa-Wait.
Come back.
Oh, man. It don't look good.
It's all locked up, Dodger.
All right.
There's gotta be some way in.
Yeah, Francis.
Now, don't cry, little girl.
They only eat when I tell them to.
- Francis, you all set?
- Farewell, Dulcinea.
- Francis!
- Frankie!
- Francis.
- Peasants.
Maestro?
- Ready, kid?
- Yeah.
Go!
Roscoe. DeSoto.
Come on, DeSoto.
Hey, hey, hey!
There is a lady present.
Well, it's nice to see that one of you has some manners.
- After you, my little croissant.
- Good grief.
And remember, quiet.
Oh!
- I broke a nail.
- Oh, balderdash.
- What you call my woman, man?
- Freeze!
- Yo, Tito.
- Right. I'll check it out.
Yeah. Oh, that's funny, Mr Winston.
But I don't think you really appreciate the situation.
Somebody could get hurt.
Now, you just get the old man on the phone and tell him it's about his daughter,
Jenny.
Okay, listen up.
Tito, Francis, I want you...
You smell that?
Yeah. It's party time.
What the...
Didn't order any pizza.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Where are those dogs?
Oh, Oliver!
I thought I'd never see you again.
Ahem. Gentlemen.
What's the occasion?
Come to rescue your little friend?
- Say goodbye, Francis.
- Oh, boys!
- Whoopsy-daisy!
- All right! What a woman!
Francis, you keep an eye on the monitors. Rita, over here.
What is this, a slumber party?
Get going, you stupid mutts!
Francis, is the coast clear? Francis!
- Goodness! Oh, whatever do we do?
- What are we gonna do, Dodge?
- Yo, Tito. Hot-wire.
- Hey, no way, Dodger, man.
- I've been barbecued too many times, man.
- Good luck, Alonzo.
- Huh?
- I'll be waiting.
Hey!
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
What is this?
All right, girlie, open the door.
Come on, now.
Girlie, I'm warnin' ya.
- Come on, Tito.
- You just...
- Back up, DeSoto.
- DeSoto?
- Come on!
Come on!
This has all been very entertaining.
But the party is over.
Oh, come on!
Come on, come on! Let's go!
Fagin!
Hey, man, you're ugly! And you're uglier than him! And you're Ugly, Part Three!
Hey, you're Revenge of the Ugly!
Okay, friends, come on.
Mr Fagin! Mr Fagin, help me!
All right! Check it out.
Help me! Oh.
- Save me! Save me, Alonzo!
- Hey, get off my back, woman.
I'm driving.
- Let go!
- Jenny, jump!
Alonzo!
Oliver?
Oliver? Oliver!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dearJenny
Happy birthday to you
- And many more
- Don't forget to make a wish, Jennifer.
All right, anybody want some cake?
Okay, Einstein, but not the whole thing.
Yeah, you got it now, baby.
Yeah, left foot, right foot.
All right. Check it out.
There you go. Relax. Hey!
- Tito, you dance divinely.
- He's cheating!
- Hit him! Hit him!
- Body slam! Come on, hit him again.
Murder him. Twist his arm!
- Foxworth residence. Mr Foxworth!
- Body slam him now!
Uh, my goodness.
You're back tomorrow?
Oh, she'll be so surprised to see you.
Y-Yes, goodbye, sir.
- All right. Get him! Get him!
All right. Look out!
- Hit him! Come on. Murder him! Get him!
- Pick him up. Hold him there.
- Ta-da!
- I believe that's a ten spot, old sport?
- Now, where...
Where is that chequebook?
Oh, look at the time!
Well, we better be going.
Indeed.
Frances, Rita, Tito, vamanos!
- The streets are calling!
- Now, Jennifer, have we forgotten anything?
Oh, yeah. Thanks, everyone.
The gifts were great.
Bye, Mr Fagin, and thank you.
Oh, bye-bye, Jenny.
Come on, boys, it's time for us to go.
Alonzo, darling, could I see you for a moment? Privately?
Privately. Ooh!
Coming, Alonzo?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys beat it. Uh, uh, my baby and I, uh, we gotta talk.
You know, you're not so bad for a bug-eyed little creep.
- With a little grooming...
- Grooming? Uh...
That's it. We'll start with a bath.
Bath?
- Let's go!
- Bye-bye.
- Oh, Oliver, we shall meet again.
- Hey, see you around, kid.
Goodbye, you guys.
Boys, let's go!
Listen, kid, you just wanna hang out or anything...
Hey, Dodger, man. Hey, do you see her anywhere?
- Hey, whoa!
- Man, I can't keep this woman off me.
- Oh, man, I gotta get away from that chick...
- Alonzo?
Alonzo
Oh, uh, goodbye, Oliver.
Hey, you guys, wait for me, man!
Alonzo Federico Tito, you come back here this minute!
Hey, whoa, kid.
You think you can handle the champ?
Sure.
Hey, you're okay. For a cat.
We'll keep a spot open for you in the gang. Vice president, uptown chapter.
Later, kid.
- Why should I worry, tell me
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!
- Why should I care
- What a delightful scoundrel.
Say, I may not have a dime
Oh, but I got
street savoir faire
Why should we worry
Why should we care
We may not have a dime, but
we've got street savoir faire
Why should we worry
Why should we care
It's just a be-bopulation
We got street savoir faire
The rhythm of the city
Boy, once you get it down
Said, you can own this town
You can wear the crown
Why should we worry
Why should we care
It's just a doo-wopulation
We got street savoir faire
Why should we worry
Why should we care
And even when we cross that line
We got street savoir faire
