WE WERE ON A TV SHOW ONCE,
AND WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE A BIG ENTRANCE
THROUGH SOME SLIDING DOORS.
AND THEY HAD A HUGE STAGEHAND
BACK THERE WHO WAS GONNA OPEN
THE DOORS FOR US.
THEY GOT US IN POSITION.
SOMEBODY SAID, "BREAK A LEG,"
YOU KNOW, AND WALKED AWAY.
THIS BIG STAGEHAND
TURNS TO US AND SAYS,
"SO YOU'RE THE GUYS
WHO KILLED BAMBI'S MOTHER."
AND WE SHRANK AWAY.
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU SELDOM
HEARD FRANK'S NAME...
WITHOUT OLLIE'S ALONG WITH IT,
OR OLLIE'S WITHOUT FRANK'S NAME.
IT WAS "FRANK AND OLLIE."
THEY REALLY PIONEERED
THIS TYPE OF ANIMATION.
THEY BROUGHT PERSONALITY
ANIMATION BEYOND, UH,
EVEN WHERE WALT
THOUGHT IT COULD GO.
OH!
SHE COULDN'T BE!
OH!
SHE COULDN'T BE!
I'VE NEVER GONE
ANY PLACE ON THIS EARTH...
THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW
AND COULD TALK ABOUT,
SPECIFICALLY,
SCENES THAT
FRANK AND OLLIE DID.
HOW'S THAT FOR TOUCHING,
I MEAN, BILLIONS OF PEOPLE?
WHAT ARE THERE,
4h BILLION ON THE PLANET?
I'D GUESS THAT HALF OF 'EM
KNOW SOME SCENE THAT FRANK
OR OLLIE DID.
HEY.
GOOD MORNING.
OH, HI.
BOY, YOU SURE GOT
A LOT OF TRASH.
YEAH, A LOT
OF OLD MANUSCRIPTS
THEY DIDN'T LIKE.
HUH. MUST'VE HAD
A BIG PARTY.
NO.
YEAH.
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
THIS WEEK.
WE FIRST MET AT STANFORD.
WE WERE IN THE ART DEPARTMENT,
AS I RECALL.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF
AN ART DEPARTMENT THERE REALLY.
THE REASON WAS THAT
MRS. STANFORD WALKED IN
ON A CLASS BACK IN 1900,
AND THERE WAS A NUDE MODEL,
AND SHE SAID, "AH!
NEVER BE ANOTHER NUDE MODEL
OR A DRAPED MODEL
HERE AT STANFORD."
SO, UH, WE HAD TO GO
ON UP THE PENINSULA.
UP TO, UH, WHERE?
SAN MATEO?
SAN MATEO.
YEAH.
- IN ORDER TO GET...
- TWO NIGHTS A WEEK.
OUR LIFE DRAWING CLASS IN.
THEN WE'D GET CREDIT
BACK DOWN AT STANFORD FOR IT.
AND ON THE WAY BACK,
WHY, I'D TALK FRANK
INTO PLAYING THE PIANO...
AT THIS LITTLE SPEAKEASY
UP ON THE HILL
ABOVE THE HIGHWAY.
SO WE'D GO IN THERE, AND
THEY'D GIVE US FREE DRINKS
FOR HIM PLAYING THE PIANO.
YEAH, BUT WE ALSO HAD TO LEAVE
ONE OF THE PAINTINGS
WE'D MADE THAT DAY...
IN THE LANDSCAPE
PAINTING CLASS.
OUR VAN GOGHS
OR OUR CEZANNES.
WE FELT LIKE
WE WERE RIGHT IN...
WHATEVER WE HAPPENED TO BE.
WITH THOSE TOP PAINTERS
OF THE DAY, YOU KNOW?
SO WE'D GO OUT AND MAKE
A PAINTING, COME BACK IN
AND TRADE IT FOR DINNER.
WE WERE ARTISTS.
AFTER COLLEGE,
WE CAME DOWN TO LOS ANGELES...
TO GO TO ART SCHOOL,
AND WE MOVED INTO
A BOARDINGHOUSE.
YEAH, WHERE THIS
RETIRED UNDERTAKER LIVED.
HIS WIFE WAS SO MAD
THAT SHE NOW HAD TO RUN
THIS BOARDINGHOUSE...
THAT SHE WOULDN'T
EVEN SPEAK TO HIM.
AND THEIR SON PRACTICED
HAVING FUNERALS...
OUT IN THE BACKYARD
UNDER YOUR WINDOW.
YEAH. HE CALLED 'EM
"GRASS FUNERALS."
I'D ALWAYS LIKED CARTOONS,
BUT I NEVER FOUND ANY THAT
I REALLY LAUGHED TOO HARD AT.
THEN ONE NIGHT I WENT
TO SEE THIS THING...
WHERE THE DOG GOT CAUGHT
IN THE FLYPAPER.
AND IT WAS
JUST HILARIOUS TO ME.
I ROLLED ON THE FLOOR,
AND SO DID EVERYBODY
WHO WAS WITH ME.
AT THE TIME
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS SO FUNNY.
I JUST KNEW THAT THERE
WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT THIS PICTURE...
AND SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT
THIS DOG THAT I'D NEVER SEEN
HAPPEN ON THE SCREEN BEFORE.
AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE
THAT ANYBODY...
COULD MAKE A DOG
LOOK LIKE HE WAS THINKING.
THE WAY HE'D TRY TO FIGURE OUT,
AND HIS EYEBROWS WOULD GO DOWN
AND UP.
IT WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
I'D NEVER THOUGHT OF GOING
INTO THE ANIMATION BUSINESS...
BECAUSE ANIMATION
WAS NOT CONSIDERED A PROFESSION.
YOU KNOW,
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT...
NEWSPAPER CARTOONISTS
DID SOMEHOW.
NOBODY WAS VERY INTERESTED
IN IT, AND THERE WEREN'T
ANY STUDIOS TO GO TO.
♪ YOU'RE NOTHIN'
BUT A NOTHIN' ♪
♪ A NOTHIN'
A NOTHIN' ♪
♪ YOU'RE NOTHIN'
BUT A NOTHIN' ♪
♪ A NOTHIN'
A NOTHIN' ♪
THEN IN THE SPRING
OF 1934,
I SAW THIS NEW MOVIE
FROM THE DISNEY STUDIOS
CALLED THE FLYING MOUSE,
AND IT WAS
A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION TO ME...
BECAUSE IT HAD THE FEELINGS,
THE EMOTIONS OF THE CHARACTERS,
AND, UH, MORE PATHOS
IN THE STORY,
AND, UH, IT REALLY GRABBED YA.
♪ YOU'RE NOTHIN'
BUT A NOTHIN' ♪
♪ A NOTHIN'
A NOTHIN' ♪ ♪
WELL, I THOUGHT,
"GEE, THIS FLYING MOUSE,
"IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO
THAT DIRECTION,
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE
THAT WOULD INTEREST ME."
THE IDEA OF BRINGING
A CHARACTER TO LIFE
REALLY BEGAN TO FASCINATE ME.
SO I TOOK THE TRYOUT
AT DISNEY'S AND GOT HIRED.
17 DOLLARS A WEEK.
BUT THIS WAS
THE DEPRESSION, '34.
UH, WEREN'T MANY JOBS AROUND.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THE ONLY JOBS THAT I HEARD OF...
WERE WITH DISNEY'S
OR WITH THE W.P.A.
I'VE ALWAYS USED
AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.
FOR SOME REASON I SEEM TO GET
MY BEST IDEAS WHILE I'M SHAVING.
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE ELECTRICAL
CURRENT'S SO CLOSE TO MY BRAIN.
NAH.
I REMEMBER ONE MORNING
I WAS LYING IN BED
IN OUR BOARDINGHOUSE.
FRANK WAS SHAVING,
AND I WAS WAITING 'TIL
HE FINISHED WITH THE RAZOR.
WE BOTH USED
THE SAME ONE.
AND HE TURNS AROUND
AND HE SAYS,
"OH, BY THE WAY, THEY WANT YOU
TO TAKE A TRYOUT AT DISNEY'S."
AND I THOUGHT, "GEE WHIZ!
"HERE I'M GOING TO ART SCHOOL,
AND MY DAD JUST PAID
MY TUITION.
"OH, WELL, I'LL TRY IT.
"I'LL GO OUT THERE AND SEE
IF I CAN'T MAKE SOME MONEY...
AND PAY MY OWN WAY
AND GO BACK TO ART SCHOOL."
SO I WENT OUT
AND TOOK THE TRYOUT.
SOMEHOW I MADE IT.
AFTER I'D BEEN THERE,
OH, SAY ANOTHER TWO WEEKS
AFTER THAT,
I FOUND OUT
THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE
I WOULD EVER WANT TO BE.
THERE WERE FOUR ANIMATORS
THAT STOOD OUT ABOVE
ALL THE REST OF THEM...
AT THE TIME WE CAME.
THERE WAS NORM FERGUSON,
WHO WE CALLED FERGY.
THERE WAS HAM LUSKE,
AND THERE WAS FREDDY MOORE
AND BILL TYTLA.
FERGY HAD A WAY
OF DRAWING THINGS...
SO THAT YOU SAW THE OUTSIDE OF
WHAT THE CHARACTER WAS DOING...
STAGING THE ACTION.
HAM DREW A WAY THAT
REVEALED WHAT THE CHARACTER
WAS THINKING ABOUT,
WHAT HE WAS FEELING.
HELLO, JUDGIE.
I'M JENNY WREN.
I WANNA SEE JUSTICE DONE.
THEN THERE WAS BILL TYTLA,
WHO HAD THIS TREMENDOUS
INNER FEELING.
HE WAS ABLE TO GET INSIDE
OF EVERYTHING HE DID.
YOU COULD JUST FEEL THIS AS YOU
OPENED THE DOOR TO HIS ROOM.
YOU'D FEEL, "WHOOPS,
I DON'T BELONG IN HERE.
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
THAT'S VERY POWERFUL."
BUT FREDDY, UH,
HE WAS REAL HAPPY.
WE WAS BALANCED UP
ON HIS CHAIR HERE,
AND HE HAD TO BE
WELL-BALANCED, LIKE A DIVER,
BEFORE HE COULD DRAW.
THEN HE'D PULL DOWN
THE PIECES OF PAPER AND...
♪ ♪ PULL DOWN ANOTHER,
AND VERY FAST.
AND HE HAD THIS TREMENDOUS
APPEAL IN HIS DRAWINGS.
HE COULDN'T MAKE A DRAWING
THAT DIDN'T HAVE EVERYTHING
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
IT MIGHT NOT BE DOING
THE RIGHT THING,
BUT ALL HIS DRAWINGS
ALWAYS HAD THE ARM...
SO ONE ARM RELATED
TO ANOTHER, SO THE HEAD
RELATED TO THE SHOULDER.
EVERYTHING WAS IN
THE RIGHT PLACE.
WELL, HUH, SO LONG.
I'LL BE SEEIN' YA...
I HOPE.
MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF WALT
WAS THAT HE WASN'T A BIG SHOT.
HE WAS JUST WALKING
AROUND THE HALL LIKE
ANY OF THE FELLOWS.
AND, UH, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I HAD EXPECTED,
BUT, UH, I LOOKED ON HIM
MORE AS A TEACHER...
BECAUSE, REMEMBER,
I WANTED TO WORK ON CHARACTERS
THAT HAD PERSONALITY...
WHO YOU COULD BRING TO LIFE
IN SITUATIONS THAT CALLED FOR
EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS,
AND HE WAS THE MAN WHO WAS
LOOKING FOR THE SAME THING.
SO THAT MADE
A REAL NICE RELATIONSHIP.
AND THE GUY WAS INTO
EVERY PHASE OF THE THING.
HE WOULD CRITICIZE
THE DRAWINGS.
HE WOULD CRITICIZE
THE ACTING.
HE'D CRITICIZE THE SIZES OF
THE DRAWINGS, THE PERSPECTIVE.
AND HE HAD
THIS WONDERFUL KNACK OF KNOWING
WHAT WAS UNIVERSAL IN APPEAL,
WHAT WAS UNIVERSAL
IN THE UNDERSTANDING...
AND WHAT PEOPLE
WOULD LAUGH AT.
AND HE'D GET YOU
ROLLING ON THE FLOOR
YOU'D BE LAUGHING SO HARD.
I SOON REALIZED, "HERE'S THE GUY
THAT MAKES THIS STUDIO GO."
AND, OF COURSE,
I'D HEARD ABOUT HIM FOR YEARS,
BUT NEVER REALIZED THAT
HE WAS THAT IMPORTANT.
RALPH WRIGHT HAD NEVER BEEN
IN A MEETING WITH WALT BEFORE,
AND HE WAS APPREHENSIVE
ABOUT IT.
HE HAD THESE DRAWINGS
OF PLUTO WAKING UP
IN THE MORNING,
AND HE WAS CONCERNED
WHETHER WALT WOULD
LIKE IT OR NOT.
AND HE WAS TRYING
TO TELL THE STORY,
AND HE LOOKED AT WALT...
AND WALT WASN'T PAYING
ANY ATTENTION TO HIM.
WALT WAS DOING
ALL THIS STUFF
LIKE FRANK'S DOING.
AND, "GOD,"
RALPH THOUGHT.
"MY GOD, I'M WORKING
FOR A SPASTIC.
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?
HE'S NOT PAYING
ANY ATTENTION TO MY STUFF."
AND HERE HE WAS
ACTING OUT WHAT HE SAW
IN RALPH'S DRAWINGS.
HE SAID,
"COULDN'T WE HAVE...
"YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN YOU
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, YOU GOT
THIS BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH?
COULDN'T WE
HAVE PLUTO DO A LITTLE MORE
OF THAT TYPE OF THING?"
RALPH THOUGHT HE WAS LIKE
ONE OF THESE BRITISH KINGS
THEY NEVER TALKED ABOUT.
I'M A KIND OF A SENTIMENTAL GUY,
I GUESS.
THE WAY I'VE SAVED THIS PENCIL
THAT FRED MOORE...
DREW MICKEYS AND
SNOW WHITE DWARVES WITH...
AND LAMPWICK AND PINOCCHIO.
UM, I KEEP IT TAPED UP
TO MY WINDOW...
TO REMIND ME OF HOW GREAT
THE GUY WAS...
AND HOW MUCH HE MEANT TO ME.
MORE BEAUTIFUL STUFF
CAME OUT OF THIS PENCIL.
IT JUST FLOWED OUT LIKE...
LIKE LIQUID.
BEAUTIFUL DRAWINGS
OF THE DWARVES...
WHERE HE'D DRAW
THE CHEEKS ON THEM,
WHERE IT WAS A SLIGHTLY
WIDER LINE AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE CHEEK OR ON THE NOSE.
ANYWAY, THERE WAS A LOT
OF TALENT IN THIS PENCIL,
AND I JUST DISCOVERED
THERE'S STILL A LITTLE BIT
OF LEAD LEFT IN IT.
I MAY SAVE THAT
FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL.
WELL, I'M MICKEY MOUSE.
YA KNOW?
MICKEY MOUSE?
I HOPE YOU'VE HEARD OF ME.
I HOPE.
WELL, I'M, UH, MICKEY MOUSE.
YA KNOW? MICKEY MOUSE?
I HOPE YOU'VE HEARD OF ME.
I HOPE.
WHEN I STARTED
AT THE STUDIO, UH,
I'D HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT
THE IMPORTANCE OF PATHOS...
IN, UH, COMEDY,
AND TALK ABOUT CHAPLIN.
HE ALWAYS HAD
THIS PATHOS IN THERE.
AND, UH, I'D SAY, "PATHOS?
WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY THAT?"
PATHOS IS SOMETHING
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL DOWN...
OR IT MAKES YOU CRY
MAYBE EVEN, YOU FEEL
SO STRONGLY ABOUT IT.
I COULD NEVER SEE THAT
THAT WAS PART OF COMEDY.
TO ME, COMEDY WAS,
"HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR."
WHAM! BANG!
YOU KNOW,
ALL THIS SLAPSTICK STUFF.
BUT GRADUALLY, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHO AFFECTED ME,
WHETHER IT WAS OLLIE
OR WHETHER IT WAS WALT...
OR THE OTHER FELLOWS,
THE OTHER ANIMATORS
AT THE STUDIO,
BUT GRADUALLY
THIS GREW ON ME.
WHAT GREATER GAG COULD YOU
EVER HAVE THAN THAT ONE
IN CITY LIGHTS...
WHERE HE'S SITTING THERE
CLOSE TO THE BLIND GIRL,
AND SHE'S WASHING OUT THE CAN
THAT SHE'S HAD THE FLOWERS IN...
AND SHE THROWS IT OUT AND
HITS HIM RIGHT IN THE FACE!
AND TOOK HIM A LONG TIME
TO COME UP WITH THIS,
BUT IF YOU WERE NOT FEELING
SORRY FOR HIM...
AND SORRY FOR HER
FOR BEING BLIND,
THE PATHOS IN THAT WHOLE MEETING
THERE WAS SO STRONG...
THAT THIS GAG JUST HITS YA.
AND IT'S STILL ONE OF THE
CLASSIC, GREATEST THINGS THAT'S
EVER BEEN DONE ON THE SCREEN.
WELL, WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T STOP THIS.
MM. THAT FEELS WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.
MM-HMM.
WELL, JUST YESTERDAY MORNING...
HE WAS GETTING DRESSED
TO COME DOWN HERE,
TRYING TO PUT THIS BELT ON,
NOT WITH THE LOOP THROUGH
BUT THE LITTLE PIN...
AND HE COULDN'T DO IT,
AND HIS FACE GOT REDDER...
AND HE JUST GOT FURIOUS
AND THREW THE THING OFF.
AND I SAID, "HONEY, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK."
WELL, THEN HE LAUGHED
AT HIMSELF.
BUT HE GETS...
OH, IT WAS JUST TERRIBLE.
AND THEN HE LAUGHED,
GAVE ME A KISS AND
EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT.
BUT...
HE CAN GET...
NOT OFTEN, BUT...
SNOW WHITE
WAS A BIGGER DEPARTURE
THAN MOST PEOPLE REALIZE.
WHEN WALT STARTED IT,
HE THOUGHT THAT, UH, YOU
JUST MAKE THE PICTURE LONGER.
MAKE LIKE A BUNCH OF SHORTS
CONSTRUCTED TOGETHER,
SIX OR SEVEN OF THEM.
IT DIDN'T WORK THAT WAY.
HE'D NEVER MADE
A FEATURE PICTURE BEFORE.
HE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT THE PROBLEMS WOULD BE...
IN PUTTING THE THING TOGETHER,
MAKE IT WORK AS A STORY.
HE WROTE A LETTER TO A FELLOW
DURING THAT TIME AND SAID,
"I GOT STORY PROBLEMS
DRAPED AROUND MY NECK
LIKE A BUNCH OF SPAGHETTI."
THE SEVEN LITTLE DWARFS.
BUT LET WALT DISNEY
TELL YOU ABOUT THEM HIMSELF.
THE DWARFS' NAMES
FIT THEIR PERSONALITIES.
THIS POMPOUS-LOOKING INDIVIDUAL
IS DOC, THE SELF-APPOINTED
LEADER OF THE GROUP.
AND THIS LITTLE FELLOW
IS BASHFUL.
HE'S SECRETLY IN LOVE
WITH SNOW WHITE.
IT WAS CALLED
"DISNEY'S FOLLY"
AROUND TOWN.
NOBODY THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD GO OVER.
AND ACTUALLY, THEY DID
RUN OUT OF MONEY.
AND, UH, ROY SAYS, "WALT,
YOU GOTTA SHOW THIS PICTURE
TO THE BANK OF AMERICA...
SO THEY'LL BRING US IN
SOME MORE MONEY."
AND, UH, WALT SAID,
"NO, I CAN'T SHOW IT.
IT'S NOT IN SHAPE."
ROY SAID,
"YOU GOT TO."
SO THIS FELLOW CAME IN
AND LOOKED AT THE PICTURE.
DIDN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT IT.
AND AS HE LEFT
TO GO BACK TO HIS CAR,
WALT AND ROY CAME RUNNING ALONG
BEHIND HIM, YOU KNOW,
LIKE A COUPLE OF KIDS, AND SAID:
"WELL, WHAT'D YOU THINK?"
AND THE GUY SAID...
"AH," HE SAYS, "YOU CAN
HAVE ALL YOU WANT."
"FINISH IT UP."
"IT WAS GREAT.
FINISH IT UP."
I THINK THE FIRST DISNEY FILM
THAT I REMEMBER WAS SNOW WHITE.
AND, UH, I WAS IMPRESSED
BY THE ACTION SEQUENCES,
BUT I WAS ALSO...
I ALSO REMEMBER
THE POIGNANT SEQUENCES.
UH, THE SADNESS OF IT.
UH, THE DWARFS AROUND
SNOW WHITE'S BIER,
AND, UH,
THAT THEY WERE CRYING.
UM, AS A CHILD, UH,
YOU KNOW, IT WAS, UH...
IT HAD A GREAT IMPACT
BECAUSE HERE WERE CHARACTERS...
THAT HAD MADE ME LAUGH AND
FEEL GOOD THROUGHOUT THE FILM,
AND NOW THEY WERE...
EXPERIENCING
AND EXPRESSING SORROW.
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T
REALIZE IT AT THE TIME...
THAT THIS WAS
AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH
IN PERSONALITY ANIMATION.
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN THE HISTORY OF FILM,
MOVING DRAWINGS
HAD BECOME MOVING DRAWINGS.
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING
ON THE PLANE?
I DON'T HAVE ROOM TO TAKE
WHAT I WANNA WEAR ON THE PLANE.
I'LL HAVE TO WEAR
SOMETHING ELSE.
MY SUITCASE
IS ALREADY FULL.
THEN THERE'S
NOTHING TO DO, HUH?
HOW MANY SHOES
SHALL I TAKE?
THREE.
THAT'S WHAT I GOT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HERE'S ONE.
WORD WITH "MISS" OR "BEER."
IS THIS "MYTH"
OR "MYTHS"?
M-I-S-S.
OH, YEAH, "MISS."
AND THE ANSWER
IS "NEAR."
"NEAR MISS"
AND "NEAR BEER."
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE NEAR.
AND I KNEW...
I'M A NEAR MISS.
I NEARLY GOT IT.
PUZZLES. GOSH.
OKAY. BETTER LUCK...
NEXT TIME.
YEAH.
I THINK FRANK, UH,
IS ONE OF THE LEAST...
UH, MERCURIAL ARTISTS
THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN.
HE'S A... HE'S A VERY
EVEN-TEMPERED MAN.
IT ISN'T THAT HE DOESN'T
FEEL THINGS DEEPLY,
BUT HE HAS THE, UH,
SUNNY DISPOSITION...
THAT SOMEHOW DOESN'T HAVE
THE FLIP SIDE OF BEING HIGH.
HE'S NOT EQUALLY LOW,
WHICH HAPPENS TO MOST OF US.
AND AS A RESULT, UH,
I'VE LIVED WITH SOMEONE
WITH THIS RELENTLESS CURIOSITY,
WHICH MAKES LIVING
LOTS OF FUN.
AND, UH... AND HE'S ALWAYS
PLEASANT TO BE AROUND,
WHICH IS MORE THAN
I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF.
NEVER MIND ALL THAT!
GET TO THE PART
WHERE I LOSE MY TEMPER!
...TEASING, TORMENTING
AND OTHERWISE ANNOYING
OUR BELOVED...
NEVER MIND ALL THAT!
GET TO THE PART
WHERE I LOSE MY TEMPER!
UH, FRANK AND OLLIE
ARE TWO OF THE GREATEST
CHARACTER ANIMATORS EVER...
BECAUSE THEY'RE
TWO OF THE GREATEST
SCREEN ACTORS EVER.
I MEAN, THEY HAVE SUCH A...
THEY'RE LIKE A REPERTORY COMPANY
WITHIN THEMSELVES.
UH, THEY'VE PLAYED
HEROES AND HEROINES,
VILLAINS AND BUFFOONS.
UH, THEY'VE EVEN PLAYED
INANIMATE OBJECTS.
I DON'T THINK LAURENCE OLIVIER
EVER PLAYED A DOORKNOB.
THE WORST THING ABOUT
STARTING A NEW SCENE...
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO START
WITH A BLANK PIECE OF PAPER,
AND THERE'S NOTHING ANYBODY ELSE
CAN DO TO HELP YOU.
YOU HAVE TO
START IT YOURSELF.
YOU CAN'T GO AND SAY,
"HEY, MAKE A DRAWING FOR ME
AND THEN I'LL WORK OVER THAT."
NO. IT'S THE REVERSE. YOU HAVE
TO MAKE THAT DRAWING FIRST.
IT'S NOT LIKE LIVE ACTION,
FOR INSTANCE,
WHERE YOU HAVE,
OH, ROBERT REDFORD AND
MERYL STREEP OR SOMETHING.
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT'S A KNOWN QUANTITY.
WE START WITH NOTHING.
THAT'S A PRETTY GIRL. OH.
SUCH PRETTY, SOFT HAIRS.
PRETTY HEAD.
YOU'RE THE PRETTIEST DOG
ON FLINTRIDGE AVENUE.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
YEAH.
YEAH.
SEE, YOU GOT
THIS LINE HERE, TEDDY.
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR A DOG.
IT'S A SMILE LINE,
LIKE PEOPLE HAVE.
YOU KNOW THIS LINE
THAT COMES DOWN HERE?
MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
THINKING AND GIVES YOU
GOOD EXPRESSIONS.
MOST DOGS DON'T HAVE THAT.
THAT MAKES YOU
A VERY SPECIAL TYPE DOG.
MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE INTELLIGENT.
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY
TOO TRUTHFUL A VIEW OF THINGS.
OLLIE AND I HAVE
A DIFFERENT APPROACH...
TO ACTUAL DRAWING...
ANIMATING.
HE IS VERY INTUITIVE
AND HAS TO FEEL FROM THE INSIDE.
HE HAD A SIGN UP ON HIS DESK
THAT SAID:
"WHAT IS THE CHARACTER
THINKING AND WHY DOES
HE FEEL THAT WAY?"
WHICH IS VERY PERCEPTIVE.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN
ANSWER THOSE TWO QUESTIONS,
YOU'RE WAY DOWN THE ROAD TOWARDS
GETTING A SCENE OUT OF IT.
FRANK IS VERY ANALYTICAL.
HE FIGURES EVERYTHING OUT,
MAKES NOTES ABOUT EVERYTHING.
I FINALLY LEARNED
TO DO THAT A LITTLE MYSELF.
EVERYTHING. FIGURES IT
ALL OUT COMPLETELY.
HE WENT TO MORE TROUBLE
IN PLANNING A SCENE...
THAN ANYBODY
IN THE STUDIO EVER DID.
WHEN I LOOKED AT
OLLIE'S DRAWINGS,
OLLIE HAD THIS WAY
OF ALMOST KISSING THE PAPER
WITH HIS PENCIL.
IT WAS JUST,
JUST SOFTLY BRUSHING IT...
AND FINDING
THE SIMPLEST FORMS.
HIS THINKING
SEEMED TO ALWAYS BE...
IN ZEROING IN ON WHAT
IS THE SIMPLEST WAY...
OF MAKING A STATEMENT
IN THIS DRAWING.
HE DIDN'T SUBJECT SCENES
TO THE SAME, UH,
RIGOROUS ANALYSIS...
THAT FRANK
SUBJECTED IT TO.
HE ALWAYS HAD
A MUCH MORE GUT, ANIMAL WAY
OF DEALING WITH THINGS.
HE COULD TAKE A SCENE...
AND HE WOULD BE ABLE
TO FEEL IT STRONGLY
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
AND I SUSPECT
HIS FIRST REACTIONS TO IT
WERE ALWAYS ACCURATE.
FRANK'S WAY OF DRAWING,
TO ME,
ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE...
THERE WAS A THOUSAND LINES
TRYING TO FIND THE PERFECT WAY
OF SAYING WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY.
AND HE WAS SEARCHING.
YOU COULD SEE IT
IN HIS DRAWING.
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
IT WAS AN INVISIBLE THING
HE WAS SCULPTING...
WITH THE EDGE OF THE TINY
LITTLE TIP OF HIS PENCIL.
A VERY THIN LINE,
NERVOUSLY SEARCHING...
AND FINDING OUT THAT FORM
AND THAT EXPRESSION.
ONCE YOU SEE THE FILM
OF YOUR DRAWINGS,
THEN YOU'RE HOOKED
ON ANIMATION.
NOTHING CAN TAKE THAT...
CAN GIVE YOU THE SAME FEELING.
SCULPTURE, PAINTING, UH,
DRAWING, ETCHINGS... ANYTHING.
NONE OF IT CAN GIVE YOU
THAT SAME FEELING OF LIFE...
THAT YOU GET OUT OF SEEING
THIS DOGGONE LITTLE CHARACTER...
WORKING AROUND
ON THE MOVIOLA...
OR ON THE PROJECTION...
PROJECTED UP ON THE SCREEN.
AND, UH, YOU FEEL LIKE...
A PARENT WHO HAS JUST SENT
HIS KID AWAY TO SCHOOL.
YOU DON'T REALLY OWN THIS GUY
UP ON THE SCREEN ANYMORE.
YOU DID FOR AWHILE. YOU WERE
VERY CLOSE TO HIM FOR AWHILE.
BUT NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HERE HE IS APPARENTLY MAKING
DECISIONS ON HIS OWN,
DOING QUITE WELL
WITHOUT YOU, THANK YOU.
I'LL TELL MY FATHER!
JIMINY! OH, JIMINY!
OH, JIMINY,
WHERE ARE YOU?
JIMINY CRICKET!
WE KNEW WE WERE DOING
A DIFFERENT KIND OF ANIMATION...
THAN HAD EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.
SOME OF THE OLD-TIMERS
THAT WERE WORKING AT THE STUDIO
WOULD EVEN TELL US,
"YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS DOING IT,
IT WASN'T LIKE THIS.
WE DIDN'T HAVE
THESE STORIES LIKE THIS."
WE KNEW AFTER SNOW WHITE
THAT WE HAD SOMETHING...
THAT WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
THAN ANYBODY HAD EVER ATTEMPTED.
I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL.
THEN I MET SOMEBODY.
I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL.
THEN I MET SOMEBODY.
PINOCCHIO, WHY DIDN'T YOU
GO TO SCHOOL?
- SCHOOL? WELL, I, UM...
- GO AHEAD. TELL HER.
I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL
'TIL I MET SOMEBODY.
MET SOMEBODY?
YEAH.
TWO BIG MONSTERS.
WITH BIG GREEN EYES.
THIS WAS ONE
OF THE FIRST CASES,
UH, ONE ON PINOCCHIO,
WHERE, UH, WE WERE
ACTUALLY ANIMATING...
RIGHT THROUGH A SEQUENCE.
'CAUSE WE BOTH HAD
LONG NOSES TO DRAW ON HIM.
WE HAD TO CHECK
WITH EACH OTHER.
YOU GOT THE SHORTER NOSES.
YOU GOT HIM PLAYING IT
LIKE A FIFE OR SOMETHING.
I HAD TO MAKE SURE
I HADN'T DRAWN IT TOO LONG
FOR THE NEXT SCENE.
I HAD THIS NOSE
THAT'S WAY OUT HERE,
AND EVERY PLACE
HE TURNED...
THE NOSE WAS GOING WAY BEYOND
ANYTHING YOU COULD DRAW.
AND WHERE WAS SIR JIMINY?
OH. JIMINY? UH...
HEY! PSST!
LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS!
THEY PUT HIM
IN A LITTLE SACK.
NO!
YES!
HOW DID YOU
ESCAPE?
I DIDN'T.
THEY CHOPPED ME
INTO FIREWOOD!
THERE WAS A FEELING THAT AS YOU
STARTED TO WORK ON A SCENE,
THAT YOU'D SORT OF
ENCASE YOUR...
YOU HAD A CONTACT WITH THE MAGIC
THAT WAS BEHIND THE DRAWING.
NOT THE DRAWING ITSELF AS MUCH,
BUT THIS WHOLE FEELING OF...
THIS IS A ROOM,
THIS IS A FOREST GLADE,
THIS IS A ROCK,
THIS IS A CASTLE...
WHATEVER IT IS
THAT YOU'RE DRAWING.
HERE'S YOUR CHARACTER IN IT,
AND YOU HAD TO BE ABLE TO SEE
YOUR CHARACTER...
WORKING IN THREE DIMENSIONS
GOING IN THERE...
AND LIVING IN THERE, AND YOU
WANTED TO LIVE IN THERE.
IF THE PHONE RANG, YOU...
IT WAS LIKE A REAL DREAM.
IT'S HARD TO COME OUT
OF THIS CONCEPT TO PICK UP
THE PHONE AND THINK,
"WHERE AM I?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE TODAY?
HELLO? WHO'S THIS?"
AHEM. COME TO...
AHEM. COME TO THINK OF IT,
IF I WAS A PIRATE,
I-I-I WOULDN'T HIDE
ANYTHING BACK THERE.
AHEM.
C-COME TO THINK OF IT,
IF I WAS A PIRATE,
I WOU... I WOULDN'T HIDE
ANYTHING BACK THERE.
ANOTHER HISS OUT OF YOU...
UH, UH, UH, UH, HISS... AND YOU
ARE WALKI TO NOTTINGHAM.
ONE MORE...
ONE MORE HISS OUT OF YOU...
UH, UH, UH, UH, HISS...
AND YOU ARE WALKING
TO NOTTINGHAM.
YOU KNOW, MY BEST IDEAS
COME TO ME WHILE I'M WALKING.
SOMETIMES I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT. I'M TOO TIRED.
BUT ONCE I GET DOWN HERE
AND START WALKING,
WHY, THE JUICES START FLOWING
AND THEN I REALLY FEEL MUCH
BETTER AND I'M GLAD I DID IT.
AND I ALWAYS DID LIKE
TO DO ATHLETICS,
AND I USED TO GET ALL KINDS
OF CARICATURES.
EVERYTHING I DID,
SOMEBODY DREW A CARICATURE OF.
YOU COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY...
WITHOUT GETTING
A CARICATURE MADE OF IT.
IF YOU WERE TRYING TO BE
SERIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING
AND EXPRESS YOUR PHILOSOPHY,
GEE, THEY'D DRAW YOU
LIKE LINCOLN
OR SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.
YOU JUST NEVER KNEW
WHAT WAS GONNA COME OUT.
YOU MADE ONE COMMENT, AND YOU'D
GET 50 DRAWINGS COMING UNDER
YOUR DOOR OR ONTO YOUR DESK.
THEY'D SLIDE IN
UNDER THE DOOR.
I WAS LOSING MY HAIR
AT ONE POINT,
REALLY?
AND FRANK MADE A DRAWING OF ME
WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS
MY HAIR WOULD COME BACK.
I WAS HAVING
HAIR TREATMENTS
OVER IN HOLLYWOOD.
THERE WERE A BUNCH
OF NICE-LOOKING GIRLS
GIVING THESE TREATMENTS.
EVERY TIME YOU'D COME IN,
THEY'D SAY, "OH! YOUR HAIR'S
REALLY COMING BACK GREAT."
LOOK AT THIS FUZZ.
BEAT YOU DO DEATH, SCRUBBING
YOUR HEAD OR SOMETHING.
WALT WASN'T BOTHERED
BY ALL THESE JOKES...
AND THINGS LIKE THAT...
WITH THE CARICATURES
THAT WENT ON...
BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT
IT WAS SHARPENING OUR SKILLS
OF COMMUNICATION.
NONE OF THESE GAGS
WOULD HAVE PAID OFF IF YOU
DIDN'T COMMUNICATE PROPERLY...
SO THAT THE GUYS KNEW WHAT YOU
WERE DOING, WHO THE JOKE WAS ON
AND WHAT THE JOKE WAS.
STRANGE COINCIDENCE
THAT I DIDN'T FIND OUT...
UNTIL, ACTUALLY, A DOZEN
YEARS AGO OR SO, I GUESS,
WAS THAT FRANK'S MOTHER...
WAS BORN IN
TUSCOLA, ILLINOIS,
THE SAME TOWN
THAT MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN.
LITTLE DINKY PLACE NOT FAR
FROM CHAMPAIGN-URBANA.
AND, UH, THAT WAS
AN UNBELIEVABLE COINCIDENCE
AMONG ALL THE OTHERS.
THAT WE BOTH HAD EDUCATORS
FOR FATHERS.
IT WAS REALLY... WEIRD.
WE BOTH LIKED
THE SAME KIND OF BOOKS.
WE GREW UP ON THE ROBIN HOOD,
IVANHOE, SCOTTISH CHIEFS.
ALL THOSE GREAT, ROMANTIC
HISTORICAL NOVELS.
I WAS ROBIN HOOD,
AND I FORMED A BAND
AROUND ME OF GUYS.
SOME OF THEM DIDN'T WANT
TO BE IN IT,
BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ELSE TO DO FOR THE SUMMER.
AND WE LIVED OUT ON THE EDGE
OF TOWN IN FRESNO,
AND THERE WEREN'T
ANY OTHER KIDS TO PLAY WITH,
SO I NEVER HAD THE ADVANTAGE
OF BEING ROBIN HOOD...
AND HAVING A WHOLE GANG
OF KIDS AROUND ME.
SAY, "YOU BE WILL SCARLETT AND
YOU BE LITTLE JOHN" AND SO ON.
SO I HAD TO DO ALL THAT
IN MY IMAGINATION.
UH, HE RODE A MOTORCYCLE
FOR AWHILE. I NEVER DID.
I RODE A BICYCLE.
I HAD A DOG. I DON'T REMEMBER
WHETHER HE HAD A DOG OR NOT.
HI, HONEY.
HI.
I'M ON MY WAY DOWN TO FRANK'S.
OKAY.
WILL YOU BE HOME
FOR LUNCH?
OF COURSE.
HI THERE, TEDDY.
YOU DIDN'T DISAPPOINT ME.
HI. HI.
WHATCHA GOT?
WE HAD SOME SPECIAL PROBLEMS
WITH BAMBI.
WE'D HAD PROBLEMS
ALL THE WAY THROUGH...
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO
MAKE DEER INTERESTING ENOUGH...
THAT THEY COULD SUSTAIN
A WHOLE FEATURE.
AFTER BAMBI'S BIRTH
AT THE START OF THE THING,
BAMBI'S MOTHER TOOK HIM AROUND
TO INTRODUCE HIM TO ALL
THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
DULL, DULL, DULL.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID,
YOU COULDN'T PUT ANY LIFE
INTO THE THING.
WELL, ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE
TRYING TO GET VOICES
FOR ALL THE LITTLE BUNNIES,
"DID
THE YOUNG PRINCE FALL DOWN?"
AND THE ANIMATORS SAID,
"THERE'S OUR VOICE!"
AND THE CASTING DIRECTOR SAID,
"GET THAT KID OUTTA HERE.
HE CAN'T ACT."
BUT WE BROUGHT HIM BACK,
AND HE COULD ACT...
AND HAD
THIS WONDERFUL VOICE.
SO HE WAS THE ONE
WHO TOOK BAMBI AROUND,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT WAS
A WHOLE DIFFERENT PICTURE.
IT WAS A PICTURE
ABOUT KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
GOOD MORNING, YOUNG PRINCE.
HELLO.
WHATCHA EATIN'?
CLOVER.
CLOVER.
IT'S AWFULLY GOOD.
IT'S DELICIOUS!
WHY DON'T YA
TRY SOME?
NO, NO!
NOT THAT GREEN STUFF.
JUST EAT THE BLOSSOMS.
THAT'S THE GOOD STUFF.
SEEMS LIKE THUMPER
WAS ALWAYS POPPING OFF,
TRYING TO TELL HIS IDEAS.
AND IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE
OF THE SECTION I DID...
WHERE THUMPER SAYS,
"EATING GREENS
IS A SPECIAL TREAT,"
HE HAD SAID TO BEGIN WITH,
TO BAMBI,
"DON'T EAT THAT GREEN STUFF.
JUST EAT THE BLOSSOMS."
- AND HIS MOTHER SAYS...
- "THUMPER, WHAT DID YOUR FATHER
TELL YOU THIS MORNING?"
WE NEVER SAW THE FATHER, BUT YOU
KNEW THAT HE'D SAY, "NOW, SON,
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER..."
SO WHEN OLLIE GOT
THE SCENE OF "EATING GREENS
IS A SPECIAL TREAT.
IT MAKES LONG,
BIG FEET, BIG EARS"...
UH, HE REALIZED
THAT THUMPER HAD PROBABLY BEEN
HEARING THIS SAID AT HOME...
OVER AND OVER AND OVER
AND WAS PRETTY BORED WITH IT.
AND SO I HAD HIM JUST LOOKING
AT THE GROUND AFTER THAT.
AND HE SAYS, "ABOUT WHAT?"
WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING UP.
AND SHE SAYS, "YOU KNOW,
ABOUT EATING THE GREENS."
"OH, THAT ONE."
CLEARS HIS THROAT,
TURNS AROUND...
AND STARTS IN RECITING
HIS "EATING GREENS
IS A SPECIAL TREAT."
THUMPER?
YES, MAMA.
WHAT DID YOUR FATHER
TELL YOU?
'BOUT WHAT?
ABOUT EATING THE BLOSSOMS
AND LEAVING THE GREENS.
OH, THAT ONE.
AHEM! EATING GREENS
IS A SPECIAL TREAT.
IT MAKES LONG EARS
AND GREAT BIG FEET.
BUT IT SURE IS
AWFUL STUFF TO EAT.
I MADE THAT LAST PART UP MYSELF.
HIYA, BAMBI!
WATCH WHAT I CAN DO!
WHEE!
COME ON!
IT'S ALL RIGHT. LOOK.
THE WATER IS STIFF.
YIPPEE!
SOME FUN, HUH, BAMBI?
I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO SAY THAT
THE BIGGEST LAUGH IN BAMBI...
IS FRANK'S SECTION,
BAMBI AND THUMPER ON THE ICE.
AND AT ONE TIME, THE DIRECTOR
AND THE STORY PEOPLE...
WERE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING
THAT DOWN TO SOMETHING
MUCH LESS THAN THAT.
WORD CAME DOWN TO ME,
AND I'D BEEN PREPARING
TO ANIMATE THAT, AND I SAID,
"OH, GOLLY,
THEY CAN'T DO THAT!"
SO I SAID, "CAN I HAVE
THREE DAYS TO TRY TO SHOW YOU
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THERE?"
SO I MADE POSE TESTS
AND THINGS WHERE YOU JUST
MADE A FEW DRAWINGS...
AND HELD THEM FOR A LONGER TIME,
BUT STILL GAVE THE FEELING...
OF WHAT WOULD BE
IN THAT SEQUENCE.
BECAUSE OF MY OWN DIFFICULTIES
WITH ICE-SKATING, I WAS VERY
SYMPATHETIC TO BAMBI.
AND, UH, OF COURSE, THUMPER WAS
THE LITTLE SMART-ALECKY KIDS...
THAT CAME SKATING AROUND ME,
YOU KNOW, BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
AND THEN SWIRLING ALL AROUND.
KINDA WOBBLY, AREN'T YA?
AHEM!
YA GOTTA
WATCH BOTH ENDS
AT THE SAME TIME.
GUESS YOU BETTER
UNWIND IT.
WOW!
WE THINK THAT BAMBI WAS
WALT'S FAVORITE PICTURE.
ALL OUR FEATURES
WERE DIFFERENT,
BUT THIS ONE WAS
THE MOST DIFFERENT.
THE DEATH
OF THE MOTHER.
IT'S THE ONE PICTURE WHERE
SOMEBODY IS REALLY KILLED,
AND THERE'S NO FAIRY DUST
OR LOVER'S KISS TO BRING HER
BACK TO LIFE.
SHE'S DEAD, AND, UH,
I THINK THAT'S THE BIG THING
THAT MADE THIS SO DIFFERENT.
WELL, THE FACT
THAT YOU HAD ANIMALS TRYING
TO CARRY A WHOLE PICTURE.
WE'D NEVER DONE THAT,
AND WALT WASN'T SURE
THAT WE COULD DO IT,
AND A LOT OF US WEREN'T SURE
THAT WE COULD MAKE THE PICTURE.
SEVEN YEARS OF WORK,
UP AND DOWN, UP AND DOWN,
FINALLY ENDED WITH THE WAR.
WE JUST BARELY
GOT THE THING FINISHED
AFTER CUTTING IT ALL UP,
BUT IT STILL HAD
THAT DIFFERENT SPARK TO IT.
WE'LL TRY TO CATCH HER
BEFORE SHE GOES OUT TO LUNCH.
OKAY. I'LL GO GET
THE OTHER PHONE.
YOU CALL ME WHEN IT...
LET ME KNOW WHEN IT RINGS.
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S RINGING.
THE IDEA
OF FRANK AND OLLIE...
I MEAN, IT'S A TERM THAT IS
THROWN AROUND SO OFTEN...
THAT I THINK THAT THERE
ARE THOSE WHO ARE THERE
WHO DON'T KNOW...
FRANK AND OLLIE
IS NOT ONE PERSON.
I MEAN, THEY ARE TWO
SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS.
'CAUSE IT JUST FLOWS.
ONE... FRANK AND OLLIE.
HELLO?
HELLO.
FRANK AND OLLIE CALLING
FROM LOS ANGELES.
AS FAR AS FRANK AND OLLIE GOES,
THE MORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT
THEIR PAST HISTORY TOGETHER,
IT BECOMES MORE
AND MORE EXTRAORDINARY.
AND I GUESS IT'S KIND OF
AN ENIGMA TO ME...
BECAUSE I'M NOT
THAT CLOSE TO SOMEBODY...
I MEAN TO A MALE FRIEND...
AND IT'S AN ENIGMA TO ME.
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS THAT FUELS IT.
WHAT IS IT THAT GIVES IT LIFE?
UH, THAT'S THE MYSTERY
OF LOVE, I SUPPOSE.
I MEAN, THERE'S NEVER ANY...
NEVER ANY EXPLANATION FOR IT.
OH, THAT'S VILLAIN STUFF.
I DON'T WANT THAT.
THIS IS TOO.
DONALD STUFF. YEAH!
THIS IS... NO, THAT'S NOT...
GOTTA BE IN HERE.
DOGGONE IT.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.
WHAT'D I DO WITH IT?
MARIE?
WHAT?
I CAN'T FIND
THAT DAMN DRAWING.
THAT'S PAR FOR THE COURSE.
- YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU?
- YES.
ALL RIGHT.
JUST A MINUTE.
SIEG HEIL!
SIEG HEIL!
BECAUSE OF THE WAR,
PINOCCHIO HAD NOT MADE MONEY.
DIDN'T EVEN PAY FOR ITSELF.
FANTASIA DID NOT MAKE MONEY,
AND BAMB THE KING OF THEM ALL,
FAILED TO MAKE MONEY.
AND IT WAS A VERY SAD TIME,
TO ME, FOR WALT,
AS WELL AS THE REST OF US,
BECAUSE WALT WAS CUT OFF
AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS.
HE WAS AT HIS MOST CREATIVE.
THERE'S JUST NO TELLING
WHERE HE WOULD HAVE GONE...
WITH THAT WONDERFUL
IMAGINATION THAT HE HAD...
WHAT HE COULDN'T DO.
EVERYTHING HE'D DONE
HAD BEEN A STEP FORWARD...
AND MORE CREATIVE
AND MORE IMAGINATIVE.
AND HERE, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THAT'S BROUGHT TO AN END.
WALT HAD BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTED
THAT FANTASIA DID NOT GO OVER...
BECAUSE HE FELT THAT WAS
A NEW FRONTIER FOR ANIMATION.
IT OPENED UP WHOLE NEW AREAS
THAT WE COULD PLAY WITH.
BUT THE AUDIENCE
DIDN'T GO FOR THAT.
HE LOST MONEY,
LOST MONEY.
FINALLY HE REALIZED,
"WELL, THE AUDIENCE WANTS
ANOTHER SNOW WHITE.
THEY WANT A GIRL
IN TROUBLE, BESET BY EVIL
AND SOMEBODY SAVES HER."
SO HE MADE CINDERELLA.
CINDERELLA MADE
AN EXTRA MILLION DOLLARS.
ALICE IN WONDERLAND
LOST A MILLION DOLLARS.
SO THE STUDIO REALLY WASN'T
IN THE BLACK UNTIL AFTER WE
GOT THE PARKS GOING...
AND TV CAME IN AND ALL THESE
OTHER INTERESTS OF WALT'S...
STARTED TO BRING IN MONEY FROM
SEVERAL DIFFERENT ENTERPRISES
AND NOT JUST THE PICTURES.
WELL, IN THE MEANTIME,
HE'D BEEN GOING THIS WAY,
AND WE STARTED GOING
THIS WAY, TRYING TO KEEP
THE PICTURES GOING...
WITH LESS AND LESS HELP
FROM WALT.
WE DECIDED THE BEST THING
FOR US TO DO WAS TO WORK ON
THE PERSONALITIES,
THE ACTING, THE ENTERTAINMENT
AS BEST WE COULD...
AND TRY TO COVER WHAT WALT
HAD GIVEN US BEFORE.
HE WAS STILL AROUND, BUT HE
WASN'T EXERCISING THE CONTROL
OVER THE FILMS...
THAT HE HAD ORIGINALLY.
EVENTUALLY, UH, DISNEY
HAD A FAVORITE PHALANX
OF ANIMATORS...
THAT HE CALLED
"THE NINE OLD MEN,"
AND, UH, EACH OF THEM
HAD CERTAIN STRENGTHS...
AND COMPLEMENTED THE OTHER.
UH, SOME OF THEM WERE
WONDERFUL DRAFTSMEN.
SOME WERE GOOD
WITH ZANY SEQUENCES
AND CHARACTERS.
OTHERS WERE
FEMALE CHARACTER SPECIALISTS.
FRANK AND OLLIE, OF COURSE,
WERE THE BEST WITH SINCERE,
EMOTIONAL ANIMATION.
AND WHAT WALT SAW
WAS THAT FRANK AND OLLIE...
WERE ABLE TO SUSPEND DISBELIEF
PICTURE AFTER PICTURE...
AND GO INTO WHATEVER
THE CHARACTER WAS...
AND SAY, "NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S A CHILD.
IT'S A FATHER, A MOTHER,
A SON, A DAUGHTER."
UH, THEY KEPT TELLING ME,
"YOUR WORK
HAS TO BE SINCERE."
AND... HOW DO YOU DRAW
SINCERE?
I MEAN, DO YOU PRESS HARDER
ON THE PENCIL?
EHHH! YOU KNOW, TO REALLY
GET TO THE HEART OF IT?
IT'S ONLY IN RETROSPECT
THAT I REALIZE THE THINGS
THEY WERE TELLING US WERE...
TRULY TRUE SECRETS
OF MAGIC, AS IT WERE.
THIS IS FRANK THOMAS,
ONE OF OUR KEY ANIMATORS.
HE'S MAKING THE DRAWINGS
THAT WILL ANIMATE PART OF
THE DIALOGUE SCENE...
WE HAVE JUST HEARD
RECORDED.
HE'S NOT JUST MAKING FACES
IN THE MIRROR FOR FUN.
HE'S MOUTHING THE WORDS
AS HE HEARS THEM.
THEN HE SKETCHES
THE POSITION OF HIS MOUTH...
SO THAT THE CHARACTER
HE'S DRAWING WILL APPEAR
TO BE SAYING THE WORDS.
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT
WE'VE GOT HERE NOW.
BY FLIPPING THESE DRAWINGS
AT THE SAME TIME AS WE PLAY THE
RECORD ON THE PLAYBACK MACHINE,
WE GET A PRETTY FAIR IDEA
OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE
ON THE SCREEN.
I'LL SHOW YA.
UH, WHAT'S A BABY?
UH, WHAT'S A BABY?
WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD,
I SAW LADY AND THE TRAMP,
AND...
MY RECOLLECTION OF IT...
IS JUST KIND OF
A HODGEPODGE OF IMAGES,
BUT ONE IMAGE OR SEQUENCE
THAT REALLY VIVIDLY
STANDS OUT IN MY MIND...
IS THE SPAGHETTI SEQUENCE.
IN THE HANDS
OF A LESSER ANIMATOR,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A HORRIBLE SCENE,
BUT WHAT FRANK DID WAS
NOTHING SHORT OF MIRACULOUS.
I LOVE THE LITTLE PERSONALITY
TOUCHES THAT HE GETS INTO IT.
UM, UH, TRAMP,
BEING A DOG OF THE STREETS,
IS NOT USED TO EATING
SUCH A WONDERFUL MEAL,
AND SO HE EATS TWICE AS MUCH
AS LADY DOES IN THE SEQUENCE.
AND LADY, WHO IS A PAMPERED
UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS DOG...
AND GETS HER, AT LEAST,
TWO SQUARE MEALS A DAY
PLUS SNACKS,
IS MORE INTERESTED IN
THE IMPROVISATIONAL SERENADE
THAT'S BEING PERFORMED FOR THEM.
UM, INADVERTENTLY, THEY CHEW ON
A SINGLE STRAND OF SPAGHETTI,
AND THEN THEIR MUZZLES MEET
AND THEY KISS.
IT'S A WONDERFUL MOMENT...
BECAUSE, UH, FRANK HAS LADY
REACTING JUST AS SHE SHOULD,
DEMURELY PULLING AWAY.
AND THEN TRAMP...
THERE'S A WONDERFUL DRAWING
AT THE END OF THE SEQUENCE...
IN WHICH HE NUZZLES OVER
A MEATBALL TO HER,
THE LAST ONE.
IT'S HIS GIFT TO HER.
AND I COULD SEE THAT
HE'S FALLING IN LOVE
WITH THIS DOG.
HE'S, UH...
IT SEEMS HE'S REFLECTING ON
WHAT THE CHEF TOLD HIM EARLIER.
HE SAYS, "THIS IS THE ONE
YOU SHOULD SETTLE DOWN WITH."
YOU CAN SEE IT
IN THE DRAWINGS.
YOU CAN SEE HE'S REALIZING
SHE'S WONDERFUL.
♪ ♪ ...WITH YOUR LOVED ONE
♪ YOU'LL FIND
ENCHANTMENT HERE ♪
♪ THE NIGHT WILL WEAVE
ITS MAGIC SPELL ♪ ♪
- ♪ WHEN THE ONE YOU LOVE...
- - DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A ROMANTIC?
YES. DON'T YOU?
AREN'T WE ALL?
YOU THINK OLLIE'S
A ROMANTIC TOO?
OH, VERY MUCH SO.
YEAH. YEAH, I'D...
YOU'D HAVE TROUBLE DEFINING
WHAT A ROMANTIC IS,
BUT I THINK IT HAS TO DO
A LOT, TO ME, WITH LIVING
WITH YOUR DREAMS,
AND, UH, DREAMING
QUITE A BIT ABOUT, UH,
OH, CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THINGS...
THE TREES, THE SKY,
THE GRASSES, THE BIRDS,
THE ANIMALS...
AND YOU BEING PART
OF THE WHOLE THING.
UH, A REALIST WOULD HAVE TROUBLE
WITH SOME OF THOSE CONCEPTS,
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO
INTO AN IMAGINARY FIELD
LIKE ANIMATION,
UH, YOU'D BETTER COME EQUIPPED
WITH THAT KIND OF NONSENSE.
RIGHT HERE.
NOW LET'S SEE.
PUT IT DOWN HERE.
AND THIS ONE...
IT WAS A WHOLE APPROACH
TOWARD LIFE, AND WALT
USED TO SAY,
"OUR WORK IS
A CARICATURE OF LIFE."
BUT THE LIFE THAT THEY
WERE CARICATURING, THEY FELT
IN VERY MUCH THE SAME WAY.
YOU CAN SEE IT WHEN HE WAS
TELLING ME ABOUT THEM, AND I HAD
NEVER MET THEM AT THIS TIME.
HE DESCRIBED OLLIE AS
"THE GUY WHO HAD THE TRAIN."
AND, OF COURSE, IT WAS
OLLIE'S PASSION FOR TRAINS...
THAT GOT WALT EXCITED
ABOUT TRAINS.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ENJOY VARIOUS HOBBIES,
AND AMONG THE LARGEST
OF THESE GROUPS ARE THE
MODEL RAILROAD ENTHUSIASTS.
IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE,
THERE ARE ABOUT SIX MILLION
PEOPLE WHO BUILD AND OPERATE
THESE SCALE MODEL RAILROADS.
AND HERE AT THE STUDIO,
THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US
WHO HAVEN'T ESCAPED THE BUG.
ONE OF OUR KEY ANIMATORS,
OLLIE JOHNSTON,
IS ONE OF THESE
BACKYARD HOBBYISTS.
AFTER SITTING AT
THE DRAWING BOARD ALL DAY,
OLLIE FINDS GREAT RELAXATION
ON WEEKENDS GATHERING
THE FELLOW HOBBYISTS...
IN THE BACKYARD
OF HIS FLINTRIDGE HOME.
OLLIE ESTIMATES THAT IT TOOK
OVER 4,000 HOURS TO BUILD
HIS MODEL STEAM ENGINE,
PATTERNED AFTER
THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO.
ALL ABOARD!
WELL, I TELL YOU,
THE ONE THING THAT SAVED
MY LIFE... AND SAVED HIS...
WAS HIS INTEREST IN TRAINS...
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LEAVE
A JOB LIKE THAT AT 5:00 AND
CLOSE THE DOOR AND THAT'S IT.
YOU BRING ALL THESE
THOUGHTS HOME WITH YOU.
YOU CAN'T TURN IT OFF.
I ALWAYS LOVED TO HEAR
FRANK PLAY THE PIANO MYSELF,
BUT I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD HAVE
SUCH AN IMPACT ON MY WIFE.
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TIME
SHE EVER HEARD HIM PLAY,
SHE WAS UP IN ABOUT TWO SECONDS
DOING THE CHARLESTON, YOU KNOW.
SHE CAN'T RESIST IT.
THAT'S ALL, FOLKS.
AND THE SAME THING
WITH FRANK AND THE MUSIC.
HE TOLD ME ABOUT FRANK AS
"THE MAN WHO PLAYS THE PIANO
IN THE FIREHOUSE FIVE   2."
BY DAY, THEY'RE ARTISTS, BUT
AT NIGHT, THEY BECOME THE MOST
FAMOUS NEW BAND IN THE COUNTRY.
FIREHOUSE FIVE   2.
I'VE DANCED TO THEIR MUSIC
AT NIGHT, AND NOW I'M CURIOUS:
CAN THE MAGIC MIRROR SHOW THEM
AT THEIR DAYTIME JOB?
SURE. BUT, EDGAR, I'D LIKE
TO SAY THIS ABOUT THE BOYS:
THEY NEVER LET THEIR MUSIC
INTERFERE WITH THEIR WORK.
YOU WATCH.
MIRROR, MIRROR, ON THE WALL,
SHOW THE HARDEST WORKERS
HERE OF ALL.
YES, MASTER.
MONTY. HEY, MONTY.
SEE IF WALT'S AROUND.
ALL CLEAR.
HE'S A HAM. THAT'S WHY
HE'S A GOOD ANIMATOR.
THAT'S WHY HIS PLAYING
WITH THE FIREHOUSE FIVE
WAS SO IMPORTANT,
BECAUSE IT WAS
AN EGO BOOSTER.
IT GAVE HIM THE RELEASE
THAT HE NEEDED...
TO PUT UP WITH THE FRUSTRATION
THAT HE HAD TO KEEP BOTTLED UP
DURING THE WEEK.
OH, I DON'T THINK
THERE WAS A DAY WENT BY...
THAT I DIDN'T FIGURE I WAS
IN THE WRONG PROFESSION...
AND THAT I SHOULD
GET OUT OF ANIMATION.
I'D GET SO MAD AT
SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING ON.
PART OF THE TIME,
IT WAS MY OWN INABILITY
TO DRAW WHAT I WANTED,
WHICH ALL OF US HAD.
I GUESS EVERY ARTIST
HAS THAT KIND OF PROBLEM.
YES, AND IN MY BOOK,
THAT'S BAD!
WELL, WHO'S THAT?
THANKS FOR BARKING.
YOU'RE SO FIERCE.
THEY BEEN WAITIN' FOR YOU.
YOU'RE SO FIERCE.
THEY COULDN'T WAIT
'TIL YOU GOT HERE.
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS
OF ANIMATION IS OBSERVING...
SEEING THINGS AROUND YOU,
SEE WHAT PEOPLE DO AND LEARN THE
LITTLE TRAITS THAT THEY HAVE,
THE WAY THEY LOOK,
THE TIMING ON THEM.
YOU HAVE TO OBSERVE
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
YEAH, MY SON...
I KEPT WATCHING HIM
WHEN HE WAS A KID,
SUCKING HIS THUMB AND
HOLDING ONTO HIS EAR
WHILE HE DID IT,
AND I USED THAT
ON PRINCE JOHN.
DEAR MOTHER.
♪ ♪ MOTHER ALWAYS DID
LIKE RICHARD BEST.
WHICH EAR DID HE HOLD?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
HE... MY SON WOULD GO
FROM EAR TO EAR THIS WAY.
PRINCE JOHN'S ARMS
WEREN'T LONG ENOUGH
TO REACH AROUND TO DO THAT.
YOU DID IT ON...
ONE OF MY BOYS HAD A WAY WHEN HE
WAS SLEEPING AND HE WAS NERVOUS,
HE'D RUB HIS FEET TOGETHER
THIS WAY AS IF THERE WAS
SOME TENSION IN THERE.
I USED THAT ON PRINCE JOHN
WHILE ROBIN HOOD WAS
STEALING THE GOLD.
THEY WERE ROOMING THERE
IN THE SAME ROOMING HOUSE...
AND THEN EVENTUALLY
HAD AN APARTMENT TOGETHER,
AND THEN, WHEN
OLLIE AND MARIE MARRIED,
FRANK MOVED ACROSS THE HALL
TO A BACHELOR'S APARTMENT.
AND I GUESS IT WAS ABOUT
THREE YEARS LATER...
THAT HE FINALLY TALKED
JEANETTE, HIS WIFE,
INTO GETTING MARRIED.
SO NEXT THING I KNEW,
MARIE WAS HOUSE-HUNTING WITH ME,
AND WE FOUND A DUPLEX,
WHICH WE BOUGHT.
BEFORE THAT, EVEN,
OLLIE AND MARIE AND FRANK...
HAD BOUGHT THE PROPERTY
IN FLINTRIDGE.
AND SO WE WERE BOTH
PLANNING HOUSES
AT THE SAME TIME.
I THINK WE, UH,
MOVED IN A LITTLE BEFORE
FRANK AND JEANNETTE DID.
OUR HOUSE WAS FINISHED
A LITTLE SOONER.
I WAS PREGNANT.
THAT AUGUST, WE BOTH HAD BABIES
WITHIN A WEEK OF EACH OTHER...
OUR FIRST SONS.
WE HAD RICK
ON THE 1st OF AUGUST,
AND SIX DAYS LATER,
THEY HAD THEIR SON, GREGG.
OLLIE AND FRANK CONTINUED
TO DRIVE TO WORK
AND BACK TO WORK...
AND DRIVE TO WORK
AND BACK TO WORK.
THIS WENT ON...
AND ON.
YEAH, THIS ONE HERE,
I FEEL...
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
BUB, BUT I FEEL
IT OUGHT TO BE USED...
EVEN THOUGH
WE'VE ALREADY GOT
A COLOR ONE OF IT.
OH, THIS IS OF CHERNABOG
FROM FANTASIA.
DON'T DECIDE
ANYTHING YET.
I FEEL LIKE THIS ONE...
NOT JUST BECAUSE
IT'S A BIGGER TRANSPARENCY...
BUT I FEEL LIKE IT SHOWS THE GUY
UP ON THE MOUNTAIN BETTER.
YEAH.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE
THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED TOO.
A GOOD
FOLD-OUT THING.
YEAH.
IT WOULD MAKE
A GREAT FOLD-OUT.
I'D BUY THAT.
WONDER IF THEY WILL.
I WAS IN
A REGULAR CAR POOL,
BUT WHEN WE HAD A DATE,
I'D RIDE HOME WITH
FRANK AND OLLIE.
AND THEY DID LET ME SIT
IN THE MIDDLE. THEY DIDN'T
PUSH ME TO THE BACKSEAT.
BUT I SOON FOUND OUT
THAT I WASN'T TO TALK...
UNTIL WE GOT
TO A CERTAIN STREET.
I'VE FORGOTTEN THE NAME
OF THE STREET NOW.
IT'S BEEN 50 YEARS.
FRANK AND I STARTED
RIDING TOGETHER
BACK IN ART SCHOOL,
AND THAT CONTINUED ON
AFTER WE BOTH GOT INTO DISNEY'S,
SO OVER THE YEARS,
WE HAD A LOT OF TIME
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.
AND WE LEARNED HOW
EACH OF US THOUGHT...
AND HOW WE APPROACHED
OUR PROBLEMS...
AND WHAT WE'RE WEAK IN
OR STRONG IN.
WHERE OTHER FELLOWS
WOULD STOP AT 5:00...
AND JUST GO HOME
AND DO SOMETHING ELSE,
WE STILL HAD 20 MINUTES
TO A HALF HOUR TO 45 MINUTES
AT ONE TIME...
TO TALK ABOUT THE PICTURE
AND WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT
AND WHAT IT NEEDED...
AND THE SCENES
THAT WE HAD COMING UP.
SO IN THE MORNING,
YOU'D START OUT WITH ALL THESE
HOT IDEAS, TALK THEM OVER.
COMING HOME, YOU'D BE TALKING
ABOUT, "GEE, I DON'T KNOW.
THIS SURE DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL."
WHEN YOU GOT TO WORK THE NEXT
MORNING, YOU HAD A PRETTY CLEAR
IDEA WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO.
SO I'D MAKE A LOT OF LITTLE
THUMBNAILS... YOU KNOW,
LITTLE BITTY DRAWINGS...
WORKING OUT THE CONTINUITY AND
THE EXPRESSIONS AND THE THINGS
I THOUGHT YOU'D GET ON THERE.
I'D TAKE THEM INTO OLLIE
AND SAY, "IS THIS WHAT
YOU EXPECTED TO SEE?
IS THIS WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT?"
HE'D SAY, "WELL, YEAH, UH...
WEREN'T YOU GOING TO DO
SOMETHING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE GOING TO DO
SOMETHING WITH THE ARM."
"OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH."
"AND THEN DOWN HERE..."
"YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW."
I'D TRY TO GET IT AWAY FROM HIM.
HE'D SAY, "NO, NO,
YOU GOTTA DO THIS."
HE'D CALL OUT
THE CHANGES HE SAW. THEN
I'D TAKE IT BACK TO THE ROOM...
AND I'D WORK ON MY SCENE
ON THAT BASIS.
SO I'D TAKE A DRAWING
IN TO HIM,
AND HE'D MAKE SOME
LITTLE SCRIBBLES OVER IT.
HE WOULDN'T TRY TO MAKE
A REAL FANCY DRAWING.
HE'D JUST POINT OUT
WHAT HE THOUGHT
MAYBE I WAS MISSING...
OR MAYBE HE'D POINT OUT
WHAT HE LIKED ABOUT MY DRAWING,
WHICH I DIDN'T SEE.
AND IN THE END, I'D END UP
WITH A MUCH BETTER DRAWING.
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
BY MYSELF.
ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR
A WHITE RABBIT, SO, UM,
IF YOU DON'T MIND...
EH? OH!
THERE HE IS!
I SIMPLY MUST GET THROUGH!
SORRY. YOU'RE MUCH TOO BIG.
SIMPLY IMPASSABLE.
- YOU MEAN IMPOSSIBLE.
- NO, IMPASSABLE.
NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WE WORKED TOGETHER
ON ALICE IN WONDERLAN TOO.
I HAD THE DOORKNOB.
I HAD ALICE.
YEAH, LUCKY YOU.
YEAH.
TOUGH ONE.
WE HAD THE TWO CHARACTERS
PLAYING AGAINST EACH OTHER,
AND WE RAN INTO
AN INTERESTING PROBLEM...
BECAUSE I NEEDED
CERTAIN LINES OF DIALOGUE...
WHERE I COULD GET
THE DOORKNOB TO WORK PROPERLY.
YOU KNOW, WORKING HIS MOUTH.
HE ALWAYS WANTED THE STUFF...
I WANTED THE STUFF WHERE I COULD
HAVE ALICE NOT SAYING ANYTHING.
IT WOULD BE MUCH SIMPLER.
I DIDN'T WANT THOSE LINES.
HE HAD TO ANIMATE...
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN
HAVING A DOORKNOB WHEN HE
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO.
BUT LOOK!
I'M JUST THE RIGHT SIZE!
OH. NO USE.
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
I'M LOCKED!
- OH, NO!
- BUT OF COURSE,
YOU'VE GOT THE KEY, SO...
- WHAT KEY?
- NOW DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE LEFT IT UP THERE.
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
I'M LOCKED.
OH, NO!
OH, NO!
YOU KNOW, WHEN WALT
WAS LOOKING AT THIS STUFF,
HE SAID, "DID YOU DO
ALL THESE ALICES?"
AND I SAID, "YEAH."
HE SAYS, "WE'LL HAVE TO PUT YOU
ON WENDY IN PETER PAN."
I SAID TO WALT,
"THAT'LL KILL HIM."
SO HE PUT ME ON MR. SMEE.
EVEN THERE, WE HAD ARGUMENTS
ABOUT WHICH CHARACTER WAS
GONNA GET THE LINES HE WANTS.
I HAD CAPTAIN HOOK,
AND IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT
THAT HE HAVE CERTAIN LINES...
WHERE HE COULD GESTURE
AND BE THE GRAND FELLOW
THAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS.
LOTS OF TIMES I WANTED
THAT PART ON MR. SMEE SO
I COULD SHOW HIM REACTING.
I HAD A SCENE WITH CAPTAIN HOOK
PLAYING THE PIANO IN PETER PAN.
AND I WONDERED,
"HOW CAN HE PLAY THE PIANO
WITH A HOOK?"
SO I ASKED OLLIE WALLACE,
WHO IS A VERY GOOD
PIANIST AND ORGANIST.
HAD A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.
AND I SAID, "OLLIE,
WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?
"CAN YOU... SOMETHIN' HE
COULD DO WITH THE HOOK?
HE COULD SORT OF RATTLE IT HERE
BETWEEN A COUPLE OF NOTES?"
♪ DE-DA DE-DAY-DA
DE-DAY-DA ♪ ♪
HE COULDN'T DO THAT,
BUT HE COULD DO A THING
WHERE HE GOES:
♪ RRUMP, DERUMP
DERUMP, DERUMP, BING ♪ ♪
SOMEHOW THEY'RE ABLE
TO USE THEIR IMAGINATIONS...
TO FIT INTO ALL SORTS
OF RELATIONSHIPS.
AND THE INCREDIBLE THING IS,
YOU THEN HAVE...
MORE OF A FEELING OF REALITY...
BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST
A GOOD CARTOON CHARACTER.
IT'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE
THINKING AND FEELING AND
BOUNCING OFF OF EACH OTHER.
YES, MISS BELL.
CAPTAIN HOOK ADMITS DEFEAT.
TOMORROW I LEAVE THE ISLAND,
NEVER TO RETURN.
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT,
CAP'N.
I'LL TELL THE CREW AND...
AND THAT'S WHY
I ASKED YOU OVER, ME DEAR:
TO TELL PETER
I BEAR HIM NO ILL WILL.
ONE OF MY FAVORITE SEQUENCES
THAT FRANK ANIMATED...
WAS THE SQUIRREL SEQUENCE FROM
SWORD AND THE STONE.
MERLIN AND WART ARE
TEMPORARILY SQUIRRELS AND
TRAVELING THROUGH THE WOODS,
AND A YOUNG GIRL SQUIRREL
HAPPENS TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH ARTHUR.
LOOK, I'M NOT A BOY.
I MEAN...
- I'M NOT A SQUIRREL.
- I'M A BOY.
A HUMAN BOY,
NOT A... NOT A REAL SQ...
OH... LEAVE ME ALONE!
SHOO-WOO!
IT'S SUCH A VIVID DESCRIPTION
OF FALLING IN LOVE.
BUT A VERY POIGNANT
KIND OF LOVE...
THE KIND OF LOVE WHERE YOU FALL
MADLY IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY...
AND THEN AFTER YOU'RE IN LOVE,
YOU DISCOVER THEY'RE NOTHING
LIKE YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE.
IN THIS CASE, LITERALLY,
A DIFFERENT SPECIES.
AND, UH, WE'VE ALL HAD
RELATIONSHIPS LIKE THAT,
HAVEN'T WE?
MERLIN!
OH.
SO HERE WE ARE.
QUICK, MERLIN,
THE MAGIC.
SNICK, SNACK, SNORUM!
THERE. NOW YOU SEE?
I'M NOT A SQUIRREL.
I'M A BOY.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU.
I-I'M A BOY.
A HUMAN BOY.
OH. IF YOU COULD
ONLY UNDERSTAND.
YOU KNOW, LAD,
THAT LOVE BUSINESS
IS A POWERFUL THING.
GREATER THAN GRAVITY?
WELL, YES, BOY,
IN ITS WAY.
I'D, UH...
YES, I'D SAY...
IT'S THE GREATEST
FORCE ON EARTH.
LET'S NOT BE SILLY.
TOO LATE.
OF ALL THE GREAT
LAUGHING SCENES
IN DISNEY ANIMATION,
I THINK MY FAVORITE
IS OLLIE JOHNSTON'S IN
THE SWORD AND THE STONE...
WHEN YOU HAVE ARCHIMEDES
LAUGHING SO HARD AT
MERLIN'S IDEA...
THAT MAN SOMEDAY
IS GONNA FLY...
THAT HE CAN'T GET HIS BREATH.
THERE SHE GOES.
NO, NO, NO!
HO, HO, HO!
MAN'LL FLY, ALL RIGHT.
HO, HO, HO, HO!
JUST LIKE A ROCK.
IT WOULD HAVE WORKED
IF-IF-IF-IF IT WEREN'T FOR
THIS INFERNAL BEARD.
I NEVER...
NEVER IN MY WHOL...
YOU KNOW, AN ANIMATED CHARACTER
NEVER DOES ANYTHING ON ITS OWN.
IF IT MAKES TOO BIG A MOVE
SOMEWHERE, IT'S YOUR FAULT,
NOT THE CHARACTER'S FAULT.
AND THAT'S TRUE.
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL...
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU THINK
YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING...
HAVE A HAND DO SOMETHING
OR MOVE THEIR HEAD
IN A CERTAIN WAY.
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER
TO SEE THE EXPRESSION...
OR LINGER ON THE BODY ATTITUDE
OR SOMETHING THAT'S...
WHETHER IT'S SAD OR
WHETHER IT'S HAPPY...
WHATEVER IT IS...
SO THAT YOU COMMUNICATE THAT
WITHOUT COMPLICATING IT.
UH, PENNY...
A SCENE THAT OLLIE DID...
PENNY'S SITTING ON THE BED
IN THE ORPHANAGE,
AND SHE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE,
"WELL, THEY HAD ADOPTION DAY
AT THE ORPHANAGE,
"AND A MAN AND A WOMAN
CAME AND LOOKED AT ME,
"BUT THEY CHOOSED THE LITTLE
REDHEADED GIRL INSTEAD...
BECAUSE SHE WAS PRETTIER."
THAT WASN'T A CHILD
THAT WAS PLAYING THAT SCENE.
IT WAS A DRAWING.
SHE LOOKED AWFUL SAD...
AND SO I ASKED HER:
WHAT'S WRONG,
PENNY, HONEY?
NOTHING.
OH, COME ON NOW.
COME ON. NO SECRETS.
YOU TELL OLD RUFUS, HUH?
WELL, IT WAS
ADOPTION DAY
AT THE ORPHANAGE.
WHAT... WHAT HAPPENED?
A MAN AND A LADY CAME
AND LOOKED AT ME,
BUT THEY CHOOSED
THE LITTLE REDHEADED GIRL.
SHE WAS PRETTIER
THAN ME.
OH!
SHE COULDN'T BE!
YOU... NOW, YOU LISTEN
TO ME, DARLIN'.
YOU'RE SOMETHING EXTRA SPECIAL.
NO, I'M NOT.
WHY, SOMEDAY...
A MAMA AND A PAPA WILL
COME TO THE ORPHANAGE...
A-LOOKIN' FOR
A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL
JUST LIKE YOU.
HONEST?
HAVE TO RUN CAPTIONS.
THIS SHOULD BE AT...
WE HAVE WALT'S ACTUAL WORDS
FROM THE STORY MEETING NOTES.
DO THEY SAY ENOUGH
OR SHOULD WE ADD SOMETHIN'?
MMM, I'D HAVE TO SEE IT...
WITH THE DRAWING?
YEAH, I'D HAVE TO SEE IT
WITH THE DRAWINGS,
BUT WE GOT
A WHOLE SERIES THERE
THAT ARE REALLY GOOD...
WHERE HE FIRST STARTS
CHANGING AND PINOCCHIO
STARTS LAUGHING AT HIM...
AND THEN HE GOES OVER
AND GRABS HOLD OF PINOCCHIO.
I THINK THE REASON THAT
OLLIE AND I HAVE GOTTEN ALONG...
AS WELL AS WE HAVE
OVER THE YEARS...
IS BECAUSE
WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE,
AND FOR MANY YEARS, WE SPOKE
THE SAME LANGUAGE AS WALT.
THERE'S A TRUTH
AND AN HONESTY THERE...
THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS FIND
IN FAIRLY CLOSE FRIENDS.
SOMEBODY ALWAYS WANTS TO DO
A LITTLE ONE-UPMANSHIP
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
BUT THERE'S NEVER
ANY OF THAT WITH US.
IT ISN'T THE TYPE OF THING YOU
GO AROUND THINKING, "GEE, I GOT
A GOOD FRIEND," OR SOMETHING.
I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT IT,
AND, BY GOLLY,
WE HAD A WAY
OF WORKING TOGETHER...
THAT REALLY BENEFITED
BOTH OF US.
WE EACH LIFTED THE OTHER UP
TO SOMETHING HE COULDN'T DO
BY HIMSELF.
NOT THAT
THEY DON'T DISAGREE.
THEY DO. BUT THEY
HAVE A WAY OF SAYING,
"WELL, UH, OLLIE,
"I DON'T THINK
THAT WOULD WORK.
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S..."
"OH." AND OLLIE
WOULD LISTEN, AND
THEY'D TALK IT OUT.
THEY MAY NOT HAVE ARRIVED
AT FRANK'S SOLUTION, BUT THEY'VE
COME SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.
I'VE BEEN AMAZED AT
THE WAY THEY... THEY
NEVER LOSE THEIR TEMPER.

JUNGLE BOOK, UH, OF COURSE,
WAS A VERY IMPORTANT
AND PIVOTAL PICTURE,
NOT JUST IN THE CAREERS
OF FRANK AND OLLIE
BUT, I THINK,
FOR THE HISTORY AND FUTURE
OF DISNEY ANIMATION.
WALT DISNEY DIED
DURING THE MAKING OF IT,
SO THE NINE OLD MEN
WERE ON THEIR OWN,
AND, UH, HAD THAT FILM FAILED,
I THINK THAT DISNEY ANIMATION
MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE GONE
DOWN THE TUBES.
IT'S ALSO IMPRESSIVE TO ME
THAT FRANK AND OLLIE...
ANIMATED MORE THAN
HALF OF THE PICTURE THEMSELVES.
PRACTICALLY ALL OF
THE SCENES AND SEQUENCES
OF BALOO AND MOWGLI...
THAT WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP
THAT DEVELOPS AND CHANGES
THROUGHOUT THE PICTURE...
WAS FRANK AND OLLIE'S WORK.
FRANK AND I HAD THESE
TWO BACK-TO-BACK SEQUENCES...
THAT WERE REALLY IMPORTANT
TO THE PICTURE.
WITHOUT THESE
COMING OFF PROPERLY,
ALL THIS CHARACTER WORK
WE HAD DONE WOULDN'T PAY OFF.
THE SECTION THAT I HAD
CERTAINLY TESTED ME,
AND I THINK IT TESTED OUR
FRIENDSHIP BECAUSE I HAD TO
RELY SO MUCH ON FRANK FOR HELP,
AND I THINK
HE RELIED ON ME
IN HIS SEQUENCE.
AND IT WAS TERRIBLY
IMPORTANT THAT WE
MAKE THESE COME OFF.
THIS WAS THE TYPE OF THING
WALT TALKED ABOUT
WHEN HE SAID:
"YOU GUYS GET
THAT PERSONALITY. I'LL
TAKE CARE OF THE STORY."
YEAH, BUT THIS IS
A TOUGH PART OF THE STORY
BECAUSE, UH,
THE STORY WOULDN'T HOLD UP
WITHOUT THESE TWO SEQUENCES
IN THEM.
IT WAS TESTING THE FRIENDSHIP
OF BALOO AND MOWGLI,
AND IT WAS ALSO TESTING
OUR ABILITIES AS ANIMATORS.
THAT'S RIGHT, AND ALSO,
THE TOUGH THING WAS THAT...
BALOO WAS PUT ON THE SPOT
IN THIS.
BAGHEERA TELLS HIM HE
HAS TO TAKE THE KID BACK
TO THE MAN-VILLAGE.
AND HE SAYS, "WHY ME?"
BALOO HAD NEVER DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.
HE WAS
THE PHYSICAL TYPE.
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO
ANYTHING WHERE YOU HAD TO FIGURE
OUT A PROBLEM IN YOUR MIND.
IT WAS ALL COMPLETELY
IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM.
AND MOST OF MY SEQUENCE...
WENT ON WITH JUST TALKING,
NO REAL MOVEMENT.
THEY'RE JUST STANDING...
BAGHEERA AND BALOO...
TALKING.
WELL... WELL, WHAT
ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE'LL DO WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE BOY.
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.
YOU NAME IT AND I'LL DO IT.
GOOD.
THEN MAKE MOWGLI GO
TO THE MAN-VILLAGE.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
I PROMISED HIM HE COULD STAY
HERE IN THE JUNGLE WITH ME.
THAT'S JUST THE POINT.
AS LONG AS HE REMAINS WITH YOU,
HE'S IN DANGER.
SO IT'S
UP TO YOU.
WHY ME?
B-BECAUSE HE WON'T
LISTEN TO ME.
BUT I LOVE THAT KID.
I LOVE HIM
LIKE HE WAS MY OWN CUB.
THEN THINK OF WHAT'S
BEST FOR MOWGLI
AND NOT YOURSELF!
BUT... WELL, CAN'T...
WELL, CAN'T I WAIT
UNTIL MORNING?
IT'S MORNING NOW.
GO ON, BALOO.
UH...
AND NOW THE SITUATION CHANGES
WHEN THE BEAR HAS TO TALK
TO THE BOY...
AND TELL HIM THAT THEY'RE GONNA
GO BACK TO THE MAN-VILLAGE.
HE KNOWS THIS IS GONNA BE
A TERRIBLE BETRAYAL ON HIS PART.
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL
THE BOY. HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GONNA SAY TO HIM...
'CAUSE THEY BUILT EVERYTHING
ON THEIR TRUST
AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP.
AND MOWGLI'S SO HAPPY
AT THE IDEA OF HAVING THIS
WONDERFUL DAY WITH BALOO.
HE'S RUNNING ALL AROUND,
PULLING BALOO'S HAND,
KICKING HIM IN THE PANTS,
CLIMBING UP ON THINGS,
CHASING BUTTERFLIES.
HE'S JUST IN ECSTASY.
THIS IS REALLY
THE PAYOFF SEQUENCE
RIGHT HERE.
THIS IS... BECAUSE
THE BETRAYAL COMES HERE.
YOU HAD TO FEEL AND
UNDERSTAND WHAT BALOO
WAS SAYING AND FEELING.
YEAH, WE HAD TO DO
AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK TOGETHER...
TRYING TO WORK OUT
HOW THE BEAR WOULD ACT,
WHAT GESTURES HE WOULD USE,
WHAT TYPE OF ACTING,
WHAT EXPRESSIONS HE WOULD USE.
HOW'S HE GOING TO PLAY THIS?
AND HOW'S THE BOY
GOING TO PLAY IT TOO?
FIRST WE THOUGHT OF THINGS LIKE
A HAND ON THE FACE...
YOU KNOW, RUBBING THE CHIN.
"GEE, WHAT CAN I SAY
TO THIS GUY?"
OR...
THINGS LIKE THAT.
WALLACE BEERY USED TO DO THAT,
AND IT WAS PRETTY EFFECTIVE.
OLLIE SUGGESTED THAT
THE HAND SHOULD BE BACK HERE,
RUBBING THE BACK OF HIS NECK.
WE'D ALREADY USED THIS
RUBBING-THE-ARM THING.
HOW ABOUT... POUNDING?
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW. THE BEST, THOUGH,
THE ONE THAT COMMUNICATED
THE BEST TO THE AUDIENCE, TO ME,
WAS ONE THAT STARTED HERE
AND THEN PULLED OFF
AND CAME AROUND TO THE FACE...
BUT DIDN'T STAY ON THE FACE;
IT CAME DOWN HERE TO THE CHEST.
I KNEW A GUY IN THE ARMY WHO
USED TO SCRATCH HIS CHEST ALL
THE TIME WHEN HE WAS THINKING.
THIS WAY. AND I...
"OH, MAYBE THAT'S
THE BEST THING TO DO."
WHERE WE GOIN',
BALOO?
WELL, UH,
IT'S, UH, UM...
WELL, IT'S SORT OF
NEW AND, UH...
OH, I DON'T CARE,
AS LONG AS I'M WITH YOU.
MOWGLI, UH,
LOOK, BUDDY, UH,
THERE'S SOMETHIN'
I GOTTA TELL YA.
TELL ME WHAT, BALOO?
GEE WHIZ.
NOW HOW DID OLD BAGGIE PUT IT?
UM, UH, MOWGLI?
HA! YOU WOULDN'T MARRY
A PANTHER, WOULD YOU?
GEE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.
MOWGLI, DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU'RE A HUMAN?
I'M NOT ANYMORE, BALOO.
I'M A BEAR, LIKE YOU.
LITTLE BUDDY, LOOK.
LISTEN TO ME.
COME ON, BALOO!
NOW, MOWGLI, STOP IT NOW.
NOW HOLD STILL.
I WANNA TELL YOU SOMETHING.
NOW LISTEN TO ME!
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
OLD PAPA BEAR?
LOOK, MOWGLI, I BEEN TRYIN'
TO TELL YOU. I BEEN TRYIN'
ALL MORNING TO TELL YOU.
I'VE GOT TO TAKE YOU
BACK TO THE MAN-VILLAGE.
- THE MAN-VILLAGE!
- NOW LOOK, KID.
I CAN EXPLAIN...
- BUT YOU SAID WE WERE PARTNERS.
- NOW BELIEVE ME, KID, I...
- YOU'RE JUST LIKE OLD BAGHEERA.
- NOW JUST A MINUTE!
THAT'S GOIN' TOO FAR!
THERE'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM.
NOW HOW WE GONNA GET THE
BOY BACK INTO THE MAN-VILLAGE...
WITHOUT BALOO AND BAGHEERA
PUSHING HIM IN?
WELL, WALT HAD AN IDEA
TO ADD A GIRL...
THAT CAME OUT OF
THE MAN-VILLAGE, A LITTLE
GIRL ABOUT MOWGLI'S AGE.
AND MOWGLI'S NEVER SEEN
A GIRL LIKE THIS BEFORE.
HE SAYS, "WAIT A MINUTE.
I WANT A BETTER LOOK."
FORGET ABOUT THOSE.
THEY AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT TROUBLE.
JUST A MINUTE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
A TERRIBLE IDEA WHEN
I FIRST HEARD IT.
HERE'S THIS
TACKED-ON ENDING.
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?
THAT'S WHY WE GAVE IT
TO YOU TO ANIMATE.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
AND I WRESTLED
WITH IT, AND THE MORE
I WRESTLED WITH IT,
THE BETTER I LIKED IT.
AND SO FINALLY,
I MANAGED TO HELP
THIS LITTLE GIRL...
KIND OF INNOCENTLY SEDUCE
MOWGLI GOING BACK INTO
THE MAN-VILLAGE.
I WOULD HAVE SAID
"LURE" HIM.
MOWGLI. COME BACK.
COME BACK!
GO ON! GO ON!
AS IT TURNED OUT,
THAT MEETING WE HAD
ON OLLIE'S LITTLE GIRL...
WAS THE LAST MEETING
WE EVER HAD WITH WALT.
WE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW ILL HE WAS.
TWO MONTHS LATER
HE WAS GONE,
AND HE NEVER DID GET
TO SEE THE FINAL PICTURE.
WHEN WALT DIED,
IT LEFT A BIG HOLE
IN ALL OF OUR LIVES.
UH,
HE WAS A FRIEND...
A CLOSE FRIEND IN MANY WAYS,
AND YET HE ALWAYS
DISTANCED HIMSELF
FROM EVERYBODY ELSE.
HE WAS A GENIUS.
HE LIVED HIS WHOLE LIFE...
IN HIS OWN MIND,
IN HIS OWN HEART.
BUT HE COULDN'T HELP BUT AFFECT
ALL THE REST OF US VERY DEEPLY.
AND EVEN THOUGH HE'D NOT
BEEN WORKING WITH US CLOSELY...
FOR, OH, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN YEARS,
IT WAS STILL
A DEVASTATING MOMENT,
AND, UH, THE WHOLE WORLD CHANGED
AS FAR AS WE WERE CONCERNED.
WE KEPT THINKING BACK
OVER THOSE DAYS WHEN
YOU'D WORK SO HARD...
ALL OF US, WALT INCLUDED...
TRYING TO CAPTURE
SOMETHING RARE,
SOMETHING NEW,
SOMETHING UNIQUE IN
THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS.
ISN'T IT TERRIBLE TO THINK
THAT IF JUNGLE BOOK HAD NOT
BEEN A SUCCESS,
THERE WOULD BE NO MORE
DISNEY ANIMATION?
EXECUTIVES WERE TALKING
ABOUT PHASING IT OUT.
"COSTS TOO MUCH MONEY.
ANYWAY, THERE'S NOBODY
TO TAKE OVER.
YOU'D HAVE TO REBUILD
THE WHOLE TEAM."
AND THEN PEOPLE WENT INTO
THE THEATERS TO SEE JUNGLE BOOK.
THEY LOOKED UP ON THE SCREEN,
AND THEY SAW A BEAR NAMED BALOO
AND A BOY NAMED MOWGLI,
AND THEY CAME TO LIFE,
CROWDS FLOCKED IN,
AND THE WHOLE CYCLE
STARTED OVER AGAIN.

- Okay.
- That question sucked.
- Yeah, man!
I'm trying to explain this to you, but you're not getting what I'm telling you.

We weren't looking at this as some kind of future.
There was no promise in it.
There was no nothing in it.
People were really living in the moment.
There were no goals.
There were no aspirations.
It started here, in this area.
That's where it all started.
You know? That was the beginning of the revolution.

We were treated like kings at places that we went to.
I was on summer vacation for about 20 years.
It was cool to be in the magazines and stuff, but, you know, the bottom line was all we wanted to do was skate.
Craig understood that, like, children took the ruins of the
20th century and made art out of it.
I was, like, 12 years old and
I'm reading these articles, and you don't know where your place is in the world yet.
And you read these words and the things that he had to say and the way he said them and the photographs that accompanied them and it was like,
"Wow, I'm really a part of something incredible, something important."
In 1975, the second issue of the recently reincarnated
SkateBoarder magazine would feature
"Aspects of the Downhill Slide," the first of what would become known throughout the skateboarding world as the "Dogtown" articles.
These feature articles chronicled the adventures and exploits of Dogtown's Z-Boys.
They were the badasses. I mean, they were the freaks of the sport.
There was a scary thing about it, like, "These guys will kick your ass."
They didn't seem like they were a part of the rest of skateboarding.
It seemed like they had their own thing going on.
The Dogtown articles were the brainchild of 26-year-old artist and photojournalist Craig Stecyk.
Using a handful of pseudonyms,
Stecyk would conceive, write, photograph and design the aesthetic that would come to define the Dogtown movement.
When we saw you guys in the magazines, it was, like,
"This is full-on. They're living this."
No one skateboarded, no one rode a board, no one was as aggressive or as radical as they ever were.
The Zephyr team had guys with all different styles, and, really, it sparked a revolution.
I think the Zephyr team was straight-out the most influential skateboard team ever, ever to be assembled.
The Zephyr Skateboard Team was comprised of 12 individuals from an area in West Los
Angeles known as Dogtown.
They were Shogo Kubo, Bob Biniak,
Nathan Pratt, Stacy Peralta,
Jim Muir, Allen Sarlo,
Chris Cahill, Tony Alva,
Paul Constantineau, Jay Adams,
Peggy Oki and Wentzle Ruml.
<b>DOGTOWN and Z-BOYS</b>
<b>NARRATED BY
SEAN PENN</b>
There is a place where
America's manifest destiny collides into the Pacific Ocean.
A place where the fabled Route 66, the roadway of American dreams, terminates.
This is Dogtown.
There's an invisible line of demarcation from the north side of Santa Monica to the south side of Santa Monica.
You're looking at one side of town that had trophy houses and lots of money.
And you're looking at the south side that wasn't like that geographically.
It was actually a visible financial line, where, if you lived above
Wilshire, you had money, and, if you lived below
Wilshire, you wanted their money.
Dogtown was a territory encompassing the three beach communities of South Santa Monica,
Venice and Ocean Park.
This was the last great seaside slum.
This was not the beach that people came to vacation at.
It was Dogtown, and Dogtown was a place where you had to have eyes in the back of your head.
It was dirty. It was filthy. It was paradise.
Dogtown was a faded blip on the radar screen of popular surfing, a rundown coastal resort inhabited by surfers infamous for their aggressive localism and outcast behavior.
Surfing in 1972 or 1971 was outcast, period.
Surfing was antisocial, generally speaking, in the world of things.
It wasn't the thing you did to build your self-esteem in society.
It was like... If you were a surfer, it was like saying you were a dropout.
It was not necessarily like it is today, where you've got Kelly Slater making millions of dollars.
In 1972, 23-year-old surfboard shaper Jeff Ho,
24-year-old surfboard builder Skip Engblom and 21-year-old artist Craig
Stecyk joined together to form
Jeff Ho and Zephyr
Surfboard Productions.
In reaction to what they felt to be the mundane world of commercial surfing, the three scraped together what little cash they had and set up shop on the corner of Bay and Main
Streets in the heart of Dogtown.
They were dedicated to being anti-mainstream, and they were proud to be anti-mainstream.
I think that we probably started it because there was nobody else building surfboards of a certain type that we kind of envisioned could be built.
They were a specialist surf shop.
If you wanted the most high-performance surfboard, this was the shop to come to.
It wasn't like you were going into a standard surf shop by any stretch of the imagination.
There was other surf shops, but they didn't have the "bad boy" image as it came out of the whole P.O.P. culture.
They created a whole new identity, a totally separate, unique identity in terms of the kind of surfboards that they made, the color of the boards, the way they were shaped, what Jeff Ho was doing was kind of revolutionary at the time.
He was exploring all kinds of design concepts.
Jeff Ho was the most intense person I've ever worked for in any business environment my whole life.
Jeff was a madman.
I mean, Jeff would lose it.
He'd lose his temper.
He could just erupt on a moment's notice and put you through just the ultimate Chinese water torture on any little thing.
Jeff Ho was recognized throughout the coastal region as an eccentric surfboard shaper who pushed the boundaries of conventional surfboard design.
The boards that were coming out of the
Jeff Ho Shop were a different design.
Constantly, Jeff would shape something, develop it, try it, and then go on to the next level.
I mean, he was, like, a guy that was like Howard Hughes.
I mean, he'd make something and actually fly it.
He was making it, and he was surfing it.
So, he was exploring it as an engineer and a designer, and also actually riding it.
We just wanted to create something that was different than the other boards.
I was trying to develop something that was new, unique and different.
Inspired by the wall art tradition of local gangs and the vivid colors of the area's vibrant car culture,
Craig Stecyk airbrushed the Zephyr surfboards with a look reminiscent of Dogtown's culturally mixed neighborhoods.
It was to personalize stuff for the user, to make something that wasn't a mass-media, garbage, piece of junk that had been designed in some factory for everybody else.
Because we came from a little bit different environment.
It was graffiti art. It was full-blown, you know, urban graffiti art on surfboards.
It was very much an identification of an environment, like where we live.
"This is who we are."
Our history is based on lowriders and hot rods and Latinas.
Like, I'd fantasize about chicks with huge hair and lowriders.
You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, little blond girls named Buffy just weren't my scene.
So, therefore, that wasn't what we were at.
The average surf look at the time, the aesthetic of surfing, was very clean, very powder blue, very beige, you know, rainbows and sunsets and sandy beaches kind of a look.
What we were doing was
"the debris meets the sea."
Using the shop as their front, Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom formed the Zephyr surf team, a group made up of the best surfers in the Dogtown area.
We were in the midst of rebar and concrete, airbrush saying, "Go home."
It was a statement saying,
"Nothing's gonna stop us,
"and we're gonna do whatever the heck we want.
"And screw you if you don't like it. We don't care."
And that was the attitude, and that was the attitude in the water,
"We're here and look at us.
If you don't like it, split."
We weren't really surfers in a traditional sense.
You know, we're from Venice.

♪ Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution. ♪
♪ Leave the earth to all its sin and hate ♪
♪ Find another world where freedom waits. ♪
One mile south of the Zephyr shop, lying directly on the border of Venice and Santa Monica, was Dogtown's epicenter, the Pacific Ocean Park pier.
Around the turn of the century, visionary land developer Abbot Kinney set out to create a
European-like community, geared towards art, culture and amusement.
Kinney's dream would become Venice,
California, replete with canals, gondolas, and a full-scale replica of the colonnaded square of its Italian inspiration.
The coastal zone that ran from Venice through Ocean Park and Santa Monica became the home to so many amusement park piers that it earned the reputation as the Coney Island of the West.
Eventually, only Pacific Ocean
Park, known to the locals as P.O.P., an amusement park atop the old Lick Pier, remained.
They had this park with all this celebration of humanity and people having a good time, and they're free, and they're out in the ocean and, you know, the ocean breeze.
And then, all of a sudden, it turns into the worst nightmare you've ever imagined.
The party ended in the mid-'60s.
The beachfront expanse running from Venice through Santa Monica had become run-down and seedy.
Attendance at the once-magnificent
Pacific Ocean Park plummeted, and in 1967 it closed, and soon thereafter became a no man's land.
A place where pyromaniacs, junkies, artists and surfers could excel in symbiotic disharmony.
It was kind of like the circus had left town. It was a little scary for some people.
It was like this dead Wonderland.
I mean, you know, you've got this carcass of all these rides that are rusted and falling apart.
And it's like, you can hear the voices and the ghosts of the people that were having so much fun there, and kids like me that were making out in the sky balls that were going across at 13, you know.
It's like everything that was wonderful and fantastic suddenly has gone to death in this decrepit way.
And everybody had to live with that every day.
Burrowed deep within the derelict pier and shielded from view was the cove, a secret surfing spot wedged between a jail cell of broken and decayed pilings.
This was the most dangerous place I surfed in California. There's no question.
You're taking off basically in front of piers. You're riding through piers.
There's wood floating around. There's debris.
You could get impaled on, like, a fallen roller coaster track or, like, a piling.
You knew if you made a mistake that you were gonna pay in flesh.
I mean, you could easily hit your head underwater, go unconscious and drown.
There was one piling in the beginning that had fallen, called the angle piling, which you could go through it.
That was a tricky thing to do.
It was one takeoff spot, and you had to be an aggressive,
"This is my wave. I'm going. Don't cut me off," because, if you did get cut off, you were in the pilings, you broke your surfboard in half.
I'd never seen that many surfboards break in my life.
♪ Oh no, there goes Tokyo go go Godzilla ♪
Adorning the ruins surrounding the cove were spray-painted signs, warning intruders to keep out.

You didn't go near that place if you didn't live there or know the people, because you were gonna get hurt.
That was an extremely heavy local spot.
There was a lot of fights.
You know, people would just physically stop you and say, "You can't surf here."
It wasn't that we didn't want other people to surf the place, but just that other people would come in and do stupid things to jeopardize your life.
There's limited resources here, man.
There's 10 waves every 15 minutes, and there ain't enough for you, pal.
You had to earn your rights of passage on the land by your actions on the land and in the water.
You had to go up on the pier with a wrist rocket, hang out and shoot Vals that came out there, you know.
We would just fly things at people that we didn't know.
They saw guys that came to the pier that weren't from the area, they threw down pieces of concrete on them.
We'd start firing tiles at them.
All kinds of shit, you know?
People'd throw glass, rocks, whatever you could get your hands on.
It was really kind of neat because the water all around was, like, exploding, as shit was flying at them.
If they didn't want anybody else surfing there, nobody was going to surf there.
That's all there was to it.
Best thing I ever saw was someone paddle out in the water with the guy's carburetor on top of his surfboard.
And goes, "Hey, does this belong to you?" And dropped it in the water.
You weren't just gonna drive up, pull your car up and go,
"Wow, what a nice left. Look, the T's breaking. Let's go out."
You had to earn your way into that, man.
Working their way up through the rubble and rebar of P.O.P. was Dogtown's next generation, a group of aggressive young surfers who were all eager to make their mark in hopes of becoming part of the Zephyr team.
It's almost like a Mafia, you know? You get good enough surfing in the water, and, all of a sudden, you're a made man now.
And once you got on the
Zephyr team, you had entrée.
You're part of their group.
The Zephyr Team
Getting sponsored by the Zephyr team as a kid was nirvana.
It was, like, "Yeah, man!
"They like my moves. They like my...
I'm doing it. I can do it. I'm doing it."
If you were wearing the navy blue Zephyr shirt, you were the shit in the neighborhood.
When we were out here, it was reflecting more the hardcore urban side of the fence.
You know, the Zephyr crew was more street kids.
Most of us came from broken homes, living with our mothers.
Jeff and Skip were like the parent symbol in the equation.
Skip and Jeff really nurtured the kind of discarded kids that wouldn't have had a place to go.
♪ Gimme danger, little stranger ♪
♪ And I'll give you a piece ♪
The shop provided identity.
It was more like a place where you can go and hang out and be in the Bay Street environment.
It was much more like a clubhouse.
Everybody, like, had a little job.
You had to either fix dings or sweep the floor or, you know, roll joints for Jeff in the back.
You also knew that behind that door, there was stuff going on that no one talked about.
It was lowbrow and wild and "screw you."
♪ There's nothing in my dreams ♪
♪ Just some ugly memories ♪
♪ Kiss me like the ocean breeze ♪
I think there was a lot of family dysfunctionalism going on, and I think some of that came out aggressively in their surfing and in their skating.
The Zephyr team, in a weird way, because of the financial insecurity of the area, people looked at this and went,
"Man, I got to make it now."
We were all hungry for recognition.
So we all put out maximum effort.
We all... That's all we did.
It was a performance-based environment.
It was a very, very demanding group of people because they knew what performance was.
If you didn't come out and really perform,
I remember Jeff just, like, leaving.
We worked. We... worked.
You know, creating new moves, new this, new that.
Everybody brought something to the team.
Everybody did something different.
Everybody had a different style.
And that's what the whole thing was all about.
The aggressive performance ethic infused into these young skaters by Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom would eventually result in the undoing of the entire Zephyr organization.
<b>A BRIEF HISTORY</b>
<b>NO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES
NO FIRES</b>
In the late '50s, skateboarding became the popular after-surfing activity of the Malibu beach crowd.
Early on, skateboards took their shape in the form of small surfboards, and the maneuvers performed on the boards were strictly surfing-inspired.
♪ Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me ♪
♪ Don't be afraid to try the newest sport around ♪
Then, beginning in 1963, skateboarding began to emerge as an alternative sport for American teenagers.
California manufacturers, such as Makaha, Hobie and Jack's, began forming teams as skateboard competitions began springing up.
Many of skateboarding's early champions, skateboarders such as Danny
Bearer, Torger Johnson,
John Fries, Woody Woodward,
Bruce Logan, and the Hilton brothers, Davie and Stevie, were among the first to give the sport a stylistic aesthetic.
For a brief, fleeting period, skateboarding gained national popularity, but this popularity would be short-lived.
<b>Few Youths Entering
Skateboard Contests</b>
Skateboarding crashed in 1965.
Virtually overnight, the young sport disappeared.
Back then, if you skateboarded, the first thing that came out of someone's mouth is,
"Isn't that just like the Yo-Yo? Isn't that the same thing as a Hula Hoop?"
By the early '70s, skateboarding was viewed as just another passing kiddie fad, and only the most hardcore enthusiasts practiced it as it became nearly impossible to purchase a commercial skateboard.
If you wanted a skateboard back then, you had to go to the thrift store, buy a pair of roller skates with clay wheels, cut them in half...
Then, go out in your garage and try and find an old drawer out of a dresser that was a nice, half-inch or three-quarter-inch oak, if you were lucky.
Or go down to the hardware store, and we'd buy, like, a solid piece of oak or maple or whatever.
Borrow a Skilsaw or band saw...
Make it like a surfboard shape, you know?
And whip it out.
We used to go to Sears, like the sporting goods section of Sears, and we'd go in with tools with just our deck that we made custom, and we'd put all the new parts from the stock boards on the shelf.
- Right.
- One guy would be watching.
Two guys would be just taking all the parts.
And then we'd just cruise out of there.
Boards were equipped with clay wheels, the pinnacle of Stone Age technology.
You had to worry about hitting rocks, sliding out.
Any crack in the sidewalk is a hazard to your health.
Or a pebble... You hit a pebble, and the wheel would instantly lock up.
Your board would come to a screeching halt and you'd fly and you'd smash cement.
In 1972, East Coast surfer Frank
Nasworthy came upon a great notion, that the petroleum-based product urethane might make a good substitute for clay.
So, he created Cadillac Wheels, which would pave the way for the coming skateboard revolution.
These urethane wheels would just...
It was almost like a 4-wheel drive now, where the car would just grab the ground.
And you could really, really make hard turns.
It was the whole beginning of what skateboarding is today, period.
<b>STYLE</b>
We were just getting into surfing then, and you could only surf in the morning around here because it blows out, the wind blows out the waves around 10:00.
So, you have the rest of the day to do something, so we skateboarded.
We used to skateboard at this place called Bicknell Hill.
I mean, it ran right down the street from the Zephyr surf shop.
We started skating outside the shop at first, 'cause we were all surf rats and we were hanging around the shop, and then they decided to put this team together and we all started skating on Bicknell Hill there.
And we were trying to get real low and, you know, we would, like, be looking at the surf and riding this hill and dropping in and sliding and doing cutbacks, like we were riding a wave.
We'd work on our Berts, and then we'd set up cones and do our slaloms.
And, you know, it was really fun practicing on Bicknell together.

I think I got something to say to you ♪
♪ It's late September and I really should be back at school ♪
♪ I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used ♪
♪ Oh Maggie
I couldn't have tried any more ♪
Surfing had everything to do with everything, and skating just kind of went along after, when the waves weren't good.
That's when you skated.
Surfing was it, and skateboarding was just an extension of our surfing.
I remember being in the
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, watching Hal Jepsen's surf film, Super Session.
And a young Hawaiian surfer named
Larry Bertlemann came on the...
Larry Bertlemann was the fundamental impact on the Z-Boys thing.
The Z-Boys thing was,
"Larry Bertlemann on concrete."
That's what we were all trying to do, because Larry Bertlemann just blew doors on everybody.
He, like, put his hands on the wave.
He was one of the first guys that I remember doing that.
So we started copying that on the ground.
Larry Bertlemann exploded the status quo of surfing upright and redefined the idea of what could be done on a surfboard.
When I saw Larry Bertlemann in a movie do a cutback, I wanted to copy that more than anything in life itself on a skateboard.
If I couldn't do it in the water, I'll do it on a skateboard.
We were surfers, first and foremost.
And the low, pivotal style in surfing is really functional.
It also has a beautiful aesthetic.
We used to call them, "Do a 'Bert."'
And we'd do that on the banks.
Even on the flat ground, we'd do it.
Five miles northeast of the Zephyr shop, located in the elite neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, was Paul Revere Junior High School.
Three miles east of Paul Revere Junior
High was Kenter Canyon Elementary School.
Four miles east of Kenter was
Bellagio Elementary School.
Three miles south of Bellagio was Brentwood Elementary.
And four miles further south of
Brentwood was Mar Vista Elementary.
These five schools were built at the base of steep hillsides or burrowed within deep canyons, with walls of banked asphalt constructed to level out the sprawling playgrounds.
I think skaters were significant because they actually took those environments and they reworked them and made them into something different, that was more human, I think, than what the architects originally had planned.
<b>SKATEBOARD RIDING
IS PROHIBITED</b>
That was where it started for us.
That was like our original skate park.
We would just ride bikes there, with our skates on our handlebars.
Skate all day and break our boards, and then ride back, fix our boards and come back the next day.
These perfectly-tapered waves of black asphalt would allow for the virtual transmission of surfing-born maneuvers to concrete.
We were surfing these asphalt waves.
That's what we were doing with the skating. So we had a surf-skate style because we had the waves to ride it on.
We were, like, riding really hard and low and really doing a lot of sliding, and, like, thrusting kind of moves.
We were always touching the pavement.
It was all about feeling what you're doing.
Feeling your wheels grinding and pivoting around your hands.
I just wanted to ride more banks, go faster, do better turns.
We were totally emulating all of these surfers that we idolized, on skateboards.
Instilled within all the Dogtown skaters was a devotion to style.
Going big worked only as long as you looked good doing it.
You could get all the maneuvers, but having great style was what you were really shooting for.
Style was, like, the most important thing.
Style was everything.
♪ Watching him dash away, ♪
♪ swinging an old bouquet
- dead roses ♪
♪ Sake and strange divine ♪
♪ you'll make it ♪
I think that was one thing that really bound us all together, too, was that we all possessed a surf style.
There was no one in our group that wasn't fluent.
Individual style was who you are as an individual.
Whatever flair that you were throwing in, that's just an extension of you as your personality.
And everybody's personality is different, so everybody's style was different.
There were surfers with good style, and there were surfers that we would call
"cockroach style," or no style, you know.
And if you had a bad style, right there you had one mark against you.
'Cause you had to look at it. You had to watch someone.
If they were skating with a funky style, they were stinking up the area. You know?
So, after a while,
"Hey, you can't watch that guy.
"He smells." You know?
I mean, the blues are three chords, but every guy that plays the blues plays the blues differently, because that's their own style, right?
♪ The over- indulgent machines were their children ♪
♪ There wasn't a way down on earth here to cool 'em ♪
♪ 'Cause they looked just like humans at Kresges and Woolworth ♪
♪ "Generation Landslide close the gap between 'em" ♪
♪ And I laugh to myself every man and the ladies ♪
♪ Who never conceived of those billions dollar babies ♪
We weren't making money off of it, we didn't think there was any future in it, and we were doing it because we loved doing it.
<b>THE BIRTH
OF VERTICAL</b>
"Skaters by their very nature are urban guerillas: they make everyday use of the useless artifacts of the technological burden, and employ the handiwork of the government/corporate structure in a thousand ways that the original architects could never dream of." - Craig Stecyk, 1976
In the '70s, California experienced the worst drought on record, and the city government wouldn't allow you to water your lawn.
You weren't even allowed to serve water at a restaurant.
And so, what happened is, all these swimming pools, which are abundant in Southern
California, were drying up.
California's drought served as a midwife to the skateboard revolution, as hundreds of pools across the Los Angeles basin were left empty and unused.
Once pool riding came in, you know, that's like all that we wanted to do.
We were, like, the first people that were riding these empty swimming pools, and we had no idea what you could do.
I remember the first goal, the first day, was to make it over the light.
That was the first accomplishment in the pool, was to "over the light" successfully.
From there, we started doing double carves and hitting tile on both sides.
Our goal was to get to the lip and to actually hit the lip of the pool, so...
It was, like, completely foreign, mentally and physically.
But the fact that we were surfers, we knew which movements needed to be done.
We just didn't know if they were possible yet.
Then it got to the point where we were getting on one wheel.
All the other three wheels are out of the pool.
That one wheel's on the coping above the tile and flying back in.
We were definitely the first guys,
I mean, the whole Dogtown crew to really take it to the top, to the lip, and actually grind and pivot on the lip.
You have to understand that, what they were doing on skateboards, it just had never been done anywhere else before.
There was just no such thing.
In a covert convergence, skaters would come from miles around to savor the fleeting, illicit thrills of skateboarding inside a recently-discovered backyard pool.
Once we found a couple of good spots, we knew that there was more of them available, and we just kept scouring the neighborhood.
We did extensive searching, looking for backyard pools.
We would drive up and down the alleys in the Valley, standing on the roofs of the cars.
Jay got on the top of my car, and we're driving down alley after alley in Beverly Hills, and Jay is on the top of my car, going,
"No. No... Wait! Wait!" You know.
We'd go up and down the alleys on our bicycles and jump up and look over the fences.
We'd go up and down canyons, and take vantage points, and we had binoculars.
We went to places where the pool was completely filled in with dirt.
We dug out an entire swimming pool so that we could skate it.
We would find some that were full of water, but they had to be emptied one way or another.
I mean, they just had to...
The water had to go and they had to be ridden, man, you know what I mean?
At one point, we were so guerilla about it, we had electric pool pumps, gasoline-operated pool pumps, hundreds of yards of drainage hose, brooms, everything you needed.
♪ You're not supposed to do that ♪
There was plenty of times we found pools and we'd throw the pump in there, throw a wire over a wall, find a live socket.
Didn't know the house, didn't know any of the neighbors, any of the people.
Water would be running out...
And we'd drain a 30,000-gallon swimming pool in less than four hours.
♪ Bad boys get spanked ♪
Any house that was up for sale, that had a pool, nine times out of ten it was drained, or maybe it had two feet of water in it.
We'd drain the rest out, and we'd skate until the cops came, and then we'd split.
The tension was really high.
And you had to do what you had to do here and now.
It didn't come later.
When you have an empty swimming pool that you know might only be open for a day, or a day and a half, and that's it, you've got to skate it for as long as you can.
You had to almost, like, time yourself to be in there, trying to get there early in the morning, trying to get a few runs, and get out of there before the cops came, you know?
It was totally just illegal barging sessions.
And as soon as we heard either sirens, screeching tires, someone would yell the magic words,
"Bail!" and we were out of there.
You could definitely get arrested.
I mean, you could probably get charged a lot of money, because, let's face it, the pools weren't the same after we got done with them.
My dad would have killed me, bro.
He would have killed me if he had to pay that kind of money.
Part of it was the thrill of knowing that the police could come anytime.
We got caught skating in the Canyon Pool, and I was hiding up in the tree looking down, and there was cops below me looking for us.
And I was afraid I was gonna drop my skateboard and nail them in the head.
And then I thought,
"God, I'm gonna be arrested for," you know, "assault and battery."
If we got caught at a location, we'd go back the next day, and we would figure out how to not get caught that way.
So, if they came in the front, we'd post a lookout in the front.
If they came in through the back, we'd post a lookout in the front and back.
We'd go through the side yard, you know?
You got to understand, man, this is concrete warfare we're talking about.
This is... You know, you might find a pool, and it's here today, maybe gone tomorrow.
If you're gonna ride it, you'd better get on that shit.
♪ I see there ain't nobody out there ♪
♪ that even wants to be a little bit mellow, now is there? ♪
♪ Anybody wants to get mellow, you can turn around ♪
♪ and get the... out of here, all right? ♪
With the drought in full effect, there was nothing to prevent invading skaters from turning someone's backyard paradise into a riotous ensemble.
No pool was left untouched, and any kid could be king for a day.
There'd be five or ten guys really rocking and rolling in the bowl.
Each pushing each other's limits.
It was an incredible scene.
You could feel the energy coming out of the pool. It was intense.
Just to be there standing on the deck was hardcore, because you were privy to something that you don't readily see anywhere else, you know?
If you were in the pool, standing in there, getting ready to take a run, you were even badder. But if you were an actual player, you know, busting moves and pushing the limits of the session going on, you were a straight-out punk rock star. I mean, big time.
We pushed each other all the time.
We pushed and praised. You'd come off of a heavy grind, and then all your bros are hooting.
We were getting each other's adrenaline levels so high, that's how the stuff evolved.
On any given day, anybody was the best.
It was almost like a daily competition between all of us to see who could pull off the hottest shit.
And then we'd look up into the shallow end at each other and go, "Wow!"
When Tony Alva, or Stacy Peralta, or
Jay Adams, or Shogo, or Biniak, or Muir, any of these guys steps into a pool, it's like, even if they didn't know them, as soon as these guys rode, other people would just want to sit down and watch and learn.
I mean, that's what it really was. You talk about special.
<b>ZBOY'S
RULE</b>
So many other sports are so derivative of something else.
Even what Michael Jordan does, you know, other people play basketball, and he took it to another level.
And skateboarding, in a very great sense, comes from surfing.
But when Tony and Jay and Stacy started doing it, it was like it was coming from a whole new realm.
We really didn't know what was possible.
It had never been done before.
I think that people sometimes think that we were thinking about all this when it was happening.
Nobody was thinking about it when it was happening.
I think we talked about it afterwards, after, like, actually trying these things,
- but it was pretty much spontaneous.
- There were no precedents.
They set precedents every single day when they went out and rode.
We worked so hard to get those pools that we didn't want other people going there, because we knew if we took other people, they'd bring other people, and eventually, the pool would be lost.
We'd just keep them really, like, low profile.
You know, we wouldn't let anybody know about them.
It was almost like a local surf spot where, you know, you're not coming in.
And if you came in without our permission, you were gonna get whupped.
You didn't show up with somebody at the pool.
You had to have a meeting about that kind of shit.
You had to have a meeting, and that had to be voted.
You could argue about it, do whatever you want.
Bottom line was, you didn't clear it with the crew, and you brought someone to the pool, you know what'd happen?
You couldn't skate the pool.
I'm not shitting you.
Almost happened to me.
<b>Let's hold it one second.</b>
With the invention of the urethane wheel and the ability to ride new terrain came a groundswell of enthusiasm as skateboarding once again began to grab the attention of teens across the country.
Rumors of a national contest began circulating, prompting Ho and Engblom to build and equip their team with boards and a ragtag uniform.
We had these shirts, we had
Levis, and we had dark blue Vans.
And that was our uniform, and everybody complied to that.
That's what we wore. That's just what came up from the neighborhood.
Well, we all pretty much had grown up together, you know, and we had all been riding together, so there was a lot of camaraderie there.
And yet, at the same time, there was a competitive drive.
You know, from that P.O.P. energy, where everyone was riding each other.
If you're not gonna do well, you don't deserve to do this, right?
That's what made us, like, a step above everybody, is that we were used to competing with each other.
One of Z-Boys was always with one of Z-Boys.
And, like, we were so tightly knit as a group that we sort of used each other's different qualities to come up with a style which, in the end, ended up being unique, you know.
We each had our own style, but it was really a combination of all of us flowing together.
And Skip and Jeff sort of assessing our moves, and saying,
"Yeah, that looks good, man."
I remember Skipper coaching me on how to hold my hands.
And that I was holding my hands wrong, and that it looked bad, it was bad style.
The skateboard team was good because it gave everybody a sense of regimentation.
You know, something that you did from
3:00 till 5:00 every day or, you know...
You know, it's like daycare.
Skip would really hassle you if you screwed up, but, at the same time, he would take your time and give you the gentle pat on the back. A little advice.
He kept us in line. He wanted us to be radical.
He wanted us to be out there in the limelight. He wanted us to be visible.
He wanted our moves to be recognized.
He wanted all of that stuff for us.
But what he didn't want was, he didn't want us in jail, he didn't want us getting run over by the buses when we were doing Berts under the back wheels.
You know? But, at the same time, he wanted us to be rad.
If you looked at the story of
Peter Pan and The Lost Boys,
Pan took the children and they defeated Captain Hook, right?
But in my world, and in the world of the Zephyr shop,
I would be Captain Hook.
And we, essentially, defeated Pan, and we've turned them all into pirates.
<b>DEL MAR,
CA 1975</b>
In 1975, Bahne skateboards, the leading manufacturer of boards and wheels, resurrected competition by spearheading the first major skateboard contest since the mid 1960s, the Del Mar Nationals.
The competitive setup was based on a classic '60s model.
A plywood ramp with a top coat of urethane was built for slalom racing, and a small wooden platform was erected for freestyle.
Attention all skaters, please report to the freestyle area.
All skaters to the freestyle area.
The dated contest format did not end there, as many of the top competitors were performing the upright maneuvers made popular during skateboarding's brief boom in the '60s.
"...the world wasn't ready for the Z-Boys."
"...there was so much aggression,
"they were more like a street gang than a skate team!"
We get to Del Mar and there's this little freestyle area that's about 12 by 12, with plywood and some urethane coating on it or something.
And we're looking at each other, going,
"What the hell are we supposed to do with this?"
Del Mar would be the Zephyr team's first introduction to the world of organized skateboarding.
Their unconventional skating and disorderly presence marked them as outsiders right from the start.
It was like a hockey team going to a figure skating contest.
The difference between us and them felt very real.
♪ Now I wanna be your dog ♪
Inspired by Larry Bertlemann's low, pivotal style and the vertical walls of pool riding, the Z-Boys took skateboarding's traditional upright approach and drove it right into the ground.
They didn't like us from the first part they saw us, because, you know, we weren't of the status quo, for what they were into.
People were just looking at us, like, "Wow, what is this?"
"I mean, these guys, man, Zephyr guys, this isn't skateboarding."
And I remember me and Jay were, like,
"What are you talking about?
This is skateboarding, man."
"What the hell are you guys doing, you know, nose wheelies and all that?"
We were the rock 'n' roll, heavy metal of Dogtown.
We came prepared to kick these dudes' ass.
And we got inside their head instantly.
Man, I put on my best pimp gear, walked up there, pushed these moms and dads out of the way, threw down our entry blanks and asked for our trophies.
We had the ammo, and we knew we were just gonna bust out and blow minds.
Our purpose was to go there and shut these guys down.
Shut down Ty Page, shut down
Paul Engh, shut down Hester, shut down Skoldberg.
All those guys, dude.
♪ No you won't fool the children of the revolution ♪
The first skater from the Zephyr team to enter the competition was its youngest and most naturally gifted,
13-year-old Jay Adams, whose explosive energy and bold moves epitomized the Dogtown style.
♪ Foxy, Foxy ♪
♪ You know you are a cute little heart breaker ♪
Jay Adams went out for his first freestyle routine, the first guy they've seen of our whole group... and we knew that they didn't know what they were about to see.
And boom! Their world had changed.
It would never be the same for skateboarding again.
He was doing tricks he'd never even done before.
I remember Jay doing Berts off the side of the platform. Remember that?
Off the platform, down onto the ground, and hopping back up on the platform and skating.
People were just flipping out.
They couldn't believe that.
And I remember just looking at him, bugging out.
He was spinning nose 360s crouched on his board. He'd never done that before!
Many of the competitors, accustomed to the more upright classical form, were not impressed.
♪ You got a bad reputation ♪
♪ That's the word out on the town ♪
♪ It gives a certain fascination ♪
♪ But it can only bring you down ♪
♪ You better turn yourself around ♪
They were unconventional, and they didn't care if they were judged well, you know?
They were just there to, you know, skate and get rowdy and have fun.
Bruce Logan, Russ Howell and Ty
Page, these guys were great skaters.
But the skating maneuvers were based on a '60s paradigm.
And we decided to do it like surfers from the '70s.
They had never bent their knees and done, like, a Bertlemann turn on their skateboards.
There was not a single soul that was skating our style.
They were all riding around like stick men, man, and we were like slipping and sliding and jamming, getting in every little pocket.
They didn't know how to judge it.
They didn't know how to put it in their criteria and spit out a first place.
Some of the girls didn't like the fact that I skated like a guy, and so they protested me to the judges.
And one of the judges said that I skated better than some of the guys!
Peggy Oki took first place in the Women's Freestyle.
Jay Adams and Tony Alva took
3rd and 4th place, respectively, in the Junior Men's Freestyle.
And Nathan Pratt took 4th place in the Junior Men's Slalom.
The Zephyr team's infectious presence and abundant talent pool whet the appetite of the industry's most prominent skateboard manufacturers.
All the other companies decided they needed one of you guys to be on their team, so they went after all you guys.
Six months after the Del Mar event,
Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom would lose the very skateboard team they'd worked so hard to build.
A year later, because of mounting business problems, they would close the Zephyr shop. It would never again reopen for business.
Jeff Ho and Skip didn't have money to try and compete with people that were trying to buy us out, you know?
And, you know, I think it's kind of sad that we were bought out, on one hand. On the other hand, you know, it's like, what does a kid do when you put a candy bar in front of him?
That's sort of what was happening.
That was, you know, a hard one for me to deal with.
Because I could see that things were just gonna cave in.
It was real easy for any company to come along and just go, okay, cherry pick what they needed.
There's no way that it could hang together.
There was no way that the band could remain together.
It had to go elsewhere, because there was so much energy inherent in what was going on, it had to blow itself up and go out.
We all started to branch off in different directions.
And we represented different companies that were competing against each other.
What happened is, after Del Mar, these contests started to pop up, and every weekend we'd be going to another contest.
And then, all of a sudden we said, "Wait a minute.
"There's something more to this."
It just became obvious that something more was gonna happen here.
That it looked like skateboarding was gonna get really popular.
<b>Skating away in the ol' SA</b>
By 1975, skateboarding was on its way to a national comeback, prompting Surfer magazine to resurrect SkateBoarder, which had had a brief run in the '60s.
The magazine's second issue would feature
Craig Stecyk's first Dogtown article, his personal account of the guerilla adventures of Dogtown's Z-Boys.
Stecyk's words and photographs became the template for the attitude and aesthetic that would come to define the culture of modern-day skateboarding.
Craig had a way of looking at a situation, photographing it, writing about it, and then giving it to kids and sparking kids' imagination.
You know, some kid in Ohio could look at this and go,
"Man, there's like a dream out there, and I can have my own dream."
It certainly was something that spoke to me, and everybody in Washington.
That kind of Venice, Santa Monica, vato, wild-style writing that you guys would incorporate.
That was something, growing up in
Montana, that I just didn't know.
I didn't see it as a "being
Hispanic" thing at all.
I just thought that it was this crazy style of art, you know?
Stecyk, of course, was the master of, you know... He wrote a great story.
He was writing it in a way that it was confrontational.
It was like Hunter Thompson.
It was like, "We're... with you.
"We like to... with you. And you know what?
"We're good at it! How's that?"
"The one certain thing is: when you hit the pavement at 70 plus, it's not gonna matter who you ride for, or what your name is."
You're reading this 3,000 miles away, in a town that has snow.
So, we're living through it vicariously.
And we would live for that magazine. It was our radio station.
'Cause you're not seeing any of these people move.
You're just seeing the photos in the magazines.
♪ Act! While in delirium, ♪
♪ I no longer know what I say, ♪
♪ or what I do! ♪
♪ And yet it's necessary... make an effort! ♪
♪ Bah! Are you not a man? ♪
The photos really translated the velocity of the move, the way you guys were living.
They said way more than,
"Here's a guy on a skateboard."
They showed a lifestyle.
They showed an attitude.
They showed a code.
It was aggressive and it was stylish. It wasn't mechanical.
You'd see a Dogtown article, with, like, some, you know, torn-up pants, just ripping, and you were just like, "I want that."
Dogtowners get to go to Hollywood parties and they get to hang out with rock stars.
They break into people's backyards and skate empty swimming pools.
I'm in! Sign me up!
Everyone was into the Dogtown thing,
'cause there was no other skateboard crew that we saw in magazines doing that.
We mythologized you. We read so much about it, and we talked about it so much, while we were skating.
As hard as it might be for some people to believe, in the '70s,
SkateBoarder magazine was the biggest-selling magazine in 1978 for the entire
Southland Corporation.
That's all 7-Elevens. It was the biggest-selling magazine they had.
There were a lot of opportunities to make money.
With the Dogtown articles came international recognition and fame.
For the first time in history, teenagers were being offered huge sums of money to compete in something previously considered a rogue activity.
We were being paid to ride skateboards.
Imagine a kid today being approached by Nike, and Nike saying, "We're gonna pay you $10,000
"to spray graffiti all over the city."
"We're gonna sponsor you to, you know, spray paint graffiti."
That's what it was like in the '70s to get paid to ride a skateboard. It was crazy!
♪ I'll give you money ♪
♪ I'll give you lovin' ♪
It seemed like free money, you know?
And it just happened that we were in the right place at the right time, and we were in the magazines and...
People are looking at these magazines, you know?
And they're seeing us.
We were treated like kings at places that we went to, you know?
It was, like, just red carpets. Everywhere.
And the greatest thing about it is, we were not the valedictorians of the school.
We were the guys that would have been chosen last to succeed.
And for some reason, by doing something that everyone said was a waste of time, we ended up influencing kids all around the world.
It turned into, like, a rock star thing, you know?
I mean, I went to London,
England, in 1976 or whatever, they had a bowl named after me inside an abandoned theater in London, England.
I was like, "Wait a second. This is crazy."
Tony was the first person we knew, he was becoming famous.
And there were articles on him in People magazine and US magazine and Rolling Stone, you know, and SkateBoarder, he was the skateboarder of the year.
In 1977, Tony Alva was voted skateboarder of the year in SkateBoarder magazine's first worldwide reader's poll.
Tony's first place, along with four other places in the top 11, thrust the Dogtown skaters even further into the limelight, prompting big offers from deep-pocketed sponsors eager to ride the sport's growing popularity.
There was only a few guys that were really making some good money at it, and Stacy being one of them. I mean, Stacy, you know, he was making some good money.
I started bringing home these checks. And my parents were looking at this, going,
"What's going on here? Where's this money coming from?"
Stacy was the most commercially successful skateboarder in the world.
More of his model Warptail skateboards were sold, I think, than any skateboard ever produced.
Stacy, you know, handled himself a little bit more mature than we did.
I got to give him, you know, credit for that, because he represented himself a little bit more professionally than we did, I think, at that time.
He toured the world a lot.
I mean, every time you'd call Stacy's house, oh, he's somewhere, Australia, England,
Germany, Japan.
I wanted to go out and show the world skateboarding.
<b>DOGTOWN WILL BE

I grew up in Santa Monica.
A lot of drugs ran through the beach that I surfed at.
And I saw a lot of guys that I knew were going to stay on the beach for the rest of their lives.
And I wanted to get something out of this. This was my ticket.
Finally, I was good at something in my life, and I didn't want to let it go.
♪ One way out baby,
Lord I just can't go out the door. ♪
In 1979, Stacy Peralta would be the second Dogtown skater to win SkateBoarder magazine's worldwide reader's poll.
♪ Cause there's a man down there, might be your man I don't know. ♪
He stopped skating professionally, and then he hooked up with George Powell, and they started Powell Peralta, and he began the Bones Brigade.
And he picked all the talent, and the few guys that he picked at the time were just revolutionary.
It was just this amazing group of skaters who were doing for skating what the Zephyr team did in the '70s, and he was the mastermind behind the whole thing.
In a relationship that would span three decades,
Peralta would hook up with Craig Stecyk as his creative partner and early mentor.
Through a series of pioneering skateboard videos,
Stecyk and Peralta showcased the remarkable talents of the Bones Brigade to skaters the world over.
They turned that into the biggest skateboarding adventure ever.
I don't feel I came into my own until I was behind the scenes.
That's when I flourished.
♪ I hate fast cars ♪
Although Peralta would become the most financially successful skater to emerge from Dogtown, the two skaters who best personified the Dogtown spirit, and who won the most acclaim, were Tony Alva and Jay Adams.
Jay and I, the thing that we had so much in common is that we were both completely out of our mind, like, mischievous, you know?
We were all crazy, but Jay, Jay could instigate some shit, man.
Man, Jay was nuts! He would be screaming and making these goofy faces at... old ladies on the bus.
Giving her a big rat face, and he's right in there. Oh, man, it was unreal.
And it got to the point where the bus wouldn't even pick us up!
- They wouldn't even stop.
- They'd accelerate,
'cause they didn't know whether they were getting rocks or they didn't know whether Jay was gonna pull a wig off some lady's head.
They didn't know what the hell was gonna happen.
♪ Old man look at my life
I'm a lot like you were ♪
Jay was from a broken home, too.
And he had a stepfather in his life that treated him well and really pushed him both in surfing and skating, and took us places to skate and pushed in a loving way.
When you're six, seven years old, you're not thinking "pro surfer" too hard, but just be a surfer, be a kid, you know?
I didn't really think much about future.
- It just kind of came along, you know?
- Right.
And then, by the time I was 12 and 13, it was kind of already set, what I was gonna do, you know what I mean?
I'd just be a skateboarder and a surfer, you know?
You know what I mean?
Some kids are born and raised on, like, Graham crackers and milk.
He was born and raised on surfing and skateboarding, you know.
♪ Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true ♪
When God decided to create skateboarding, he said, "Let there be Jay Adams."
Jay Adams was the most spontaneous skater that you ever met.
Absolutely, incredibly gifted.
Jay was the most talented, natural skateboarder, surfer, athlete...
He had an energy like no one I ever met.
There's nobody like him, as far as
"skater" is concerned. He's the original.

That's what I want now ♪

When he skateboarded, you were watching something happen.
That's why Jay's so great, is 'cause nothing's ever the same, before or since.
You know, Jay doesn't practice. Jay doesn't redo it.
He doesn't do it twice. He doesn't do it three times. He doesn't even do it one time.
He's over it before it happens.
He will be in the middle of a maneuver and have the whole thing collapsing on him, and somehow in the center of that disaster, he will make something else out of it completely, which becomes art.
Jay Adams' skating was an athletic stream of consciousness.
Through a seemingly reckless approach, he attempted a series of aerial maneuvers that would presage what skaters would be doing in years to come.
When skateboarding finally blew up and people were able to make money, he really didn't care.
♪ Keep on pushing straight ahead ♪
Everybody cares about money a little bit, just...
Things don't always work out how you kind of wanted them to, you know what I mean?
He didn't give a shit about it, and I don't think that's why he did it to begin with.
He never was interested in any of the material rewards that came from skateboarding.
I think that he just basically had a total "f-you" approach to the whole commercialism of skateboarding.
It was just fun. You know, before it got too serious.
You know what I mean? Like in the amateur contest days, it was just kind of fun and stuff.
And then when it got to the, like, pro pool-riding and stuff, it just got too serious and...
What do you mean, "Too serious"?
Just guys didn't seem like they were having as much fun.
It was more of a job, and a lot of tension, you know what I mean?
But when things got commercial, I think it kind of freaked Jay out.
You know? There was responsibility.
You got to show up at a certain time.
You got to do a demo. You got to... You got to fly here...
If you had people coming to you, promising you something, making you sign contracts when you're a minor, you know, telling you what to do, telling you where to go, telling you how to act...
Those people didn't care about Jay.
He would be so naive in dealing with these people and these situations that he would believe what they said.
People just wanted to have what he had.
You know, they just wanted a piece of him.
It opened a lot of doors to do a lot of things that I probably shouldn't have.
Like quitting school and buying weed and partying, and just that kind of stuff.
But it also did good things, too, like helped me pay the rent for my mom and stuff like that.
- Do you have any regrets?
- Yeah, there's regrets, like, just doing drugs and stuff like that. You know?
Not skating as much as I should have, partying too much.
You know, I missed a lot of good times by doing things that I shouldn't have been doing.
You know what I mean?
Like, just going out, getting drunk and partying, and stuff like that.
You know? Where I could have done a lot of other things.
Or the business side, where I could have taken it more seriously and marketed myself, or had someone market myself differently, you know what I mean?
Right.
So I guess that's some teeny regrets, but nothing to cry about.
Right. You're stoked about what happened, though.
Yeah.
I mean...
There's certain mistakes that I'd like to change, but I don't trip on it too hard, you know what I mean?
Right. Do you want to say what they are?
- I kind of just did.
- Oh, okay. No, I... Okay.
Jay's probably lived one of the hardest lives I know for someone who's still alive, you know? And...
You get one chance at doing this.
And if you miss it, you don't get it again. And that's...
That's the hardest part of it.
That's the hardest part. And it's hard for me to even see it, because I see it in a guy like Jay Adams, and I go,
"He should've had it all."
Jay should have had it all, and it makes me so sad that he didn't.
Because he was... He was better than all of us.
My father was like a really hardcore, you know, real...
He was a pretty strict guy, you know, and I think that a lot of the things, a lot of the aggression that came out, you know, when he communicated with me,
I kind of transferred that to dealing with people and stuff, too.

Tony made it really known that, "Hey, man.
"I'm gonna be number one, and that's it."
Tony was Mick Jagger.
He was the radical.
He was the front man. He was preening. He was doing the show.
He was the Michael Jordan of skateboarding back then.
And at the same time, he was Dennis Rodman.
Tony had a real strong personality.
And when you hung around Tony, you were pretty much hanging around the Tony Show.
Tony was probably the first person who taught me what the word "ego" meant.
We all had big egos, but Tony's was bigger than all of ours put together.
If a person has a big ego, they better be able to back it.
And, like, Tony could back his ego.
You don't achieve those levels of your art unless you do have an ego.
Now Hackett said, when he used to go to pools with you, he said that you'd show up at the pool, and you'd walk right up to everybody sitting in, you know, the shallow end and say, "That's it, guys. I'm here. Out."
No, not necessarily. I might have done that a few times, but usually I just let my skating do the talking.
His timing and balance and speed and agility were far beyond everybody else's.
It was just a known fact.
When you saw Tony skate, he was so far above everybody else.
His style, and the way he flowed, and the lines that he drew, he was just a little more advanced than other guys at the time.
He could carve a pool fluently and effortlessly.
And then, at the same time, every turn was attacked as though his life depended on it.
He was a really fierce competitor, and Tony wanted the prize.
I've always wanted to be the best.
I've always been very competitive.
My goal was, I wanted to be a world champion.
I wanted to be the best in the world.
In 1977, on ABC's Wide World of Sports,
Tony Alva became modern skateboarding's first overall grand national champion.
At 19 years old, getting that title, the men's overall world professional skateboard champion, that was a big thing for me.
You know, that was like
Muhammad Ali, you know, kicking Joe Frazier's ass or whatever, you know.
Six months after winning the world championship,
Tony would shun the sponsorship world, and in an unprecedented move, go it alone and form his own skateboard company,
Alva Skates.
That was the turning point because
I'd done everything that I could do
- riding for other companies.
- Right.
And I was making them a lot of money without even having a model.
In that way, he was professional, and he wanted money for everything that he did, at some point, because he saw he was getting exploited.
So, I started my own skateboard company at 19 years of age.
I mean, I was pretty... self-centered at the time, man.
My deal was, like, "I'm gonna make some money.
"I'm gonna capitalize. I'm gonna travel around the... world.
"I'm gonna get laid every... night, you know?"
Like, you know, I'm gonna do it all, right now.
When Tony Alva came out with his first ad for his first company, it was a complete revolution in the skateboarding industry.
People were just up in arms.
Because here's this guy, standing just, like, really tough, and it was...
All of a sudden, the advertisement was no longer about skateboarding.
It had nothing to do with the product. It was about attitude.
There's just no two ways about it. Tony was a rock 'n' roll star.
He was so in love with the fame.
He was so in love with himself.
He could jump barrels, he could race downhill, he could do freestyle, he could do street style, he could ride vert. He did it all better than anybody.
He was one of the pioneers of the progression of skating.
I think that he really helped show what was possible on a skateboard.
Tony Alva's an icon that
I could look up to when I first got into the sport.
He is the most important skateboarder of all time, in my opinion.
You could look at the photos, you could look at the film, you could look at the guy talking back then.
So far, since I was, like, the innovator of vertical skating, and I'm, like, the oldest one and I'm only 21, we're saying that there's really no limit yet to the, I think, "oldness" that you can be.
Tony is the Chuck Berry of skateboarding.
He developed a style of playing, and Tony's gonna play that style his whole life.
That's what he does, and that's what he's always done, and that's what he'll always do.
There's no way that you can really say that, "He's over the hill," or anything, until the guy just totally drops out of the whole scene and isn't recognized as a, you know, person of high esteem in the world of professional skateboarding, or whatever he's doing.
I mean, if there was a skateboarding hall of fame,
I think Tony Alva is the first name that should go down.
<b>SKATEBOARD RIDING
IS PROHIBITED</b>
<b>THE
DOGBOWL</b>
We lived...
We lived at a place called the Dogbowl.
We were there every day, just about, skating all day.
In an ironic twist of fate, it was on the grounds of a posh estate in the affluent neighborhood of North Santa Monica where the Z-Boys came together for their final sessions in what they considered to be their crown jewel.
There was a kid, Dino, that lived there.
He was dying of, like, brain cancer, and he was a skateboard enthusiast.
You know, the kid's gonna die. He went to his father and said, "Hey, listen, for me,
"empty the pool. Let my friends skate here."
The next day, he was there with the pump.
Two days later, we were in there skating.
Every afternoon, after surfing and hanging, we would go to his house, hang out with him, and just skate his pool.
At a place you cannot even imagine, people can't imagine, the huge pool, in a beautiful property, you're allowed to skate it.
Dogbowl was the only place where we could skate in peace.
That was like a skate park to us, because the owner would let us skate and watch us skate.
There was all these dogs that lived around the pool, and they would always hang out and just stick their mugs right in like Friedman's camera lens or in like...
That's how it eventually got called the Dogbowl.
The Dogbowl sessions were definitely the heyday, like, for all of us.
Guys used to go there every day and just skate, and skate, and skate all day long.
We perfected a lot of things and had a lot of time to spend in one pool.
♪ In the attic, lights ♪
♪ Voices scream, nothing seems ♪
♪ Real's a dream ♪
Almost the entire original team would be at that pool in one day, which was, like, kind of weird.
It's kind of like it was back to the old Zephyr shop in a way.
'Cause you had this whole group of guys, and it was in Santa Monica, and it was the most incredible pool ever, and you didn't want anyone else there.
The crew, like, in a way, probably was not like that maybe ever before.
'Cause all of a sudden, everyone is famous and they know it.
- But we're still pushing each other.
- But that's it.
You're pushing each other. No one else is around. It's just the original crew.
♪ Woh, welcome to my town ♪
♪ High energy is all around tonight ♪
♪ Woh, you best beware ♪
♪ There's violence in the air tonight. ♪
♪ Well, Detroit city, she's the place to be ♪
♪ This mad dog town's gonna set you free ♪
Eventually, we were hitting the top so hard, and just grabbing the sides of our boards, just the rail and stuff, we started to pop out and actually do aerials.
It just changed the whole ballgame.
That time, fall '77, is when T.A. did the frontside air in the pool.
I mean, everyone is there, and people were doing little bits of aerials in different places.
But what Tony did one day, I think it was in September, he goes up, pulls the board up, turns in midair, comes back down into the pool, and makes it.
It was fucking unbelievable. It's something that you... It could be described today, but you just don't understand because it's a given, and it's seen.
Now, other people have said that people did aerials at other places, other times.
No one did it like Tony did, and no one did it as well.
And no one did it with style for many years to come, outside of that crew.
There are points of evolution in every sport and every art form that center around significant events which define all that follows.
When the Z-Boys began skateboarding inside empty swimming pools, they destroyed the status quo and challenged the idea of what was possible.
Tony Alva followed this line when he propelled his body and board above the coping and into the air as aerial base maneuvers would become the departure point for the next generation of modern skateboarders.
Dogtown was the actual beginning of all of vertical skateboarding and modern skateboarding as we know it today.
That was the beginning.
If you look back, you don't see a skateboard contest like you did in Del Mar today.
You don't see a flat ground, you know, some guys doing 360s and pirouettes.
They're all doing it in pipes. And basically, a half-pipe was what a swimming pool was, but we just hadn't figured out how to build a half-pipe back then yet, so we had to empty swimming pools and ride them.
There wouldn't be any X Games, there wouldn't be any vert skating, there wouldn't be anything at all if it wasn't for most of the boys that I skated with and competed against, and that whole scene.
That's where it all started.
Craig Stecyk saw what we were doing before anybody else did, and he believed in it as a culture, and he presented it as a culture.
People thought this was some, like, stupid thing that little kids did.
Right? Craig Stecyk understood it as more of an extension of society.
I think it was an act of significance.
I think you guys were doing some profoundly different things.
And I think nobody appreciated that at the time I got involved with dealing with it.
Skateboarding could have easily, without Craig Stecyk, become little league baseball.
It would have just been a novelty.
But, you know, the way Craig presented it, and the way he wrote about it,
I mean, it really brought it to another level, and it gave it a significance.
The whole Dogtown thing said,
"It isn't a ball-and-stick sport.
"It isn't about winning or losing. It's about the process.
"It's not about the ends.
It's about the means."
You know what? This sport isn't just a stepchild of another sport.
It's really, almost, an art form.
I think we were all looking for the best time.
The best ride. The best grind.
The best carve. You know?
The best barrel. Yeah.
Not to outdo each other, but just to aim for the best, you know?
'Cause the feeling you got from that, it's indescribable.

Finding an empty pool like that was like finding a secret, you know, like a secret surf spot or something.
It's like finding the most beautiful virgin woman.
There was like a sensuous, kind of like, exciting feel to it.
It was like having, you know, sex.
I mean, that's what it was like.
So it was like, every time we found a pool like that, we had the experience that, you know, here's somebody who's unridden.
I mean, I don't know how else to explain it.
I remember one time, Jay said, "Come check this out."
And there was an alley right across from his house on Highland, and I went down there, and I hear this, "Tink, tink, tink, tink."
I'm like, "What is that?"
And Jay's in hysterics.
He goes, "Just watch, man. Just watch."
All of a sudden, I see this cat come out of this under car parking garage, and it's got a 3-foot piece of string tied to its tail with a tin can with rocks in it.
And I'm like, "You got to be shitting me!"
Back then, we weren't wearing all these pads, and if you take a look at some of the still shots from back then, you'll see that I'm on the wall with nothing on.
I mean, if you fall then, you're gonna get hurt.
We didn't care. We just wanted to get radical.
Okay, really quickly. It was
August, the dog days. It was hot.
I was drunk. I was drinking papaya juice and vodka.
I was sitting on a bus bench in front of the store with Craig.
I went to Craig, "Hey, Craig, you know, these are really the dog days," and he went, "Yeah, this is really a dog town."
And I went, "Yeah, it is a dog town," and he went,
"'Cause you know, we live in Dogtown."
That's the truth. That's how it happened. That's the story. Period.
Poor baby. I used to be just like you.
A child of the night, wild and free.
I was the cat who walked by herself, and the city was my hunting ground.
I'd prowl through Gotham each evening...
... going where I liked and taking whatever I wanted.
Until I met him.
I gave him my best fight, but in the end...
... kitty got her claws clipped.

And whom, may I ask, is your attractive date?
- Veronica Vreeland, meet Selina Kyle.
- We've met.

- Oh, of course.
- Love what you've done to your hair.
- Thanks.
Since you're so devoted to wildlife, Selina...
...I can't wait to hear what you think of the museum's new conservation hall.
I had it built in honor of my grandfather, Stanton Vreeland.
He was the first to realize the importance of preserving rare animals.
Not surprising, considering how many of them he obliterated.
Excuse me?
Stanton Vreeland was a playboy sportsman who'd shoot anything...
...that wandered into his gunsight.
He had to preserve animals...
...or he'd have nothing left to shoot.
- Is that right?
Most of these critters are gone thanks to trigger-happy jerks...
...like old Grandpa.
- Selina.
But, Bruce, Miss Vreeland asked me what I thought.
I think you've said enough.
Yes, perhaps I have.
Just once I'd like to throw a party without some kook showing up.
Excuse me.
Well, that was pretty rude.
Just the cat in me, I guess.
Look, Bruce, it was sweet of you to invite me, but I don't fit in here.
Sometimes I feel like I don't fit in anywhere.
Taxi.
- Your ride, Miss Kyle.
- Hey. What the...?
- Let me out, you big ape.
- She's a live one.
In two seconds, that'll be more than I can say about you.
Calm down, pussycat.
We're all friends here.
Dummy, don't keep our pretty guest in the dark.
Yes, sir, Mr. ScarFace.
That's better.
You gotta be kidding.
What's she laughing at?
My fly ain't open, is it?
- No, sir.
- So, what's the gag?
Oh, come on. You know.
"What's the gag?"
Can it, sister. This is ScarFace you're dealing with...
...and I don't stand for no disrespect.
I'd do as he says, ma'am.
Mr. ScarFace can be quite insistent.
I don't think anyone's talking to you.
- No, sir. No, sir.
- Right.
- What do you want with me?
- My boys happened to be in the museum...
...when they saw your little set-to with Miss Ronnie V.
They also seen you licking your whiskers at the sight of Ronnie's pretty sparklers.
You're boring me, log.
What if I could provide you with a foolproof plan for snatching those rocks...
...with no risk of you getting caught?
Pass. Kitty's been staying in at night.
Not the greatest, but it beats the pound, if you know what I mean.
That's a darn shame. I thought for sure you'd want a chance to get even...
...with the Vreelands. Not just for yourself, you understand...
...but for all those poor little stuffed critters what never had the chance to fight back.
- Oh, barf.
- It's a fifty-fifty cut.
Take it or leave it.
You in, or what?
You know what, Isis?
Extinction's for wimps.
Mastodon, check.
Cave bear, check.
Saber-tooth.
Well, where did you come from?
Poor girl. Must've wandered in and got lost.
I'll let you out back.
Excuse me, Mr. ScarFace, but isn't it cruel to take advantage of that nice Miss Kyle?
Hold my hat, will you?
That's what you get for going soft on me.
Yes, sir.
There. The guard's putting the cat out like I planned.
Catwoman should have all the time she needs to lift the jewels and split.
This one's for the Vreelands.
But plans can change, can't they, Rhino?
Right, boss.
Great. Someone else is hitting the place.
Okay, boys, to work.
Sorry, kitty. You're taking the fall.
Hold it.
Could you please give me a hand?
This dinosaur seems to have fallen on me.
- How did you...?
- It's a dull story, handsome.
The Catwoman. Watch out.
- Where is she?
- Couldn't have missed her.
Looks like the hunt's on again, Isis.
I think a quick trip out of town is in order.
Don't buy your ticket yet.
What a pleasant surprise.
Though I should warn you, breaking and entering is against the law.
You would know. Care to explain what you were doing at the museum tonight?
Look, I was there earlier for a party, and I kind of lost my temper.
I went back to apologize, and the place was empty, except for the burglars.
I had my outfit in the car, and I thought if I nailed the robbers...
...I could work up some points with the cops.
Maybe even with you.
I know how bad this looks for me, but it wasn't my fault.
Would you come back to the museum and talk to the authorities?
I suppose, if you're with me.
- After all, we do make a good team.
- When we're on the same side.
The police are still talking to the guard.
That gives us a few minutes to look around.
I was looking at this exhibit earlier.
It's brand-new. Why would they remove the animals so soon?
This lock's been sprung. Our thief is clever, using dummy cards to cover his tracks.
An extinct-animal trophy is worth a fortune to the crook who can fence it.
"All those poor little stuffed critters."
That's what he was after all along.
You're not telling me something.
Know what's wrong with our relationship?
You always let me get too close.
Excuse me. I have a date with a scratching post.
We don't have to make this difficult.
But somehow we always do.
Selina?
In here.
That's right, Penguin.
I got your bird just like I promised.
Of course, it'll cost you extra.
Hey, you don't want it, fine.
I can always use it for pillow stuffing.
See there? I knew you'd be reasonable.
While I got you on the horn, can I interest you in a Tasmanian tiger?
A steal at only 2 mil.
No, huh? That's okay.
I got a client dying to get her paws on it.
I thought I saw a pussycat.
Let go.
You know, I never had much use for animals, except Rhino here.
Thanks, boss.
Then it hit me, some rich geeks will pay big bucks for critters they can't...
...shoot no more. You know what these things are worth dead?
- More than my life, I bet.
- You win, kitten.
I needed a dummy to keep the cops busy while I grabbed the stiffs.
So you conned me into that phony jewel robbery.
Too bad for you, you figured it out.
Now we're gonna find out if there really is more than one way to skin a cat.
- Rhino.
- No!
Lousy fleabag.
Oh, great. Him, I don't need.
I don't know whether to bite you or kiss you.
Later.
Get me out of here.
Hurry.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
- Put me down.
- Sure.
Mr. ScarFace.
Let's let the chips fall where they may.
Get me off of here. Dummy, help me.
Help, help! Someone do something.
Please, let me save him.
Dummy, please.
That's one way to remove a splinter.
What's wrong, Ventriloquist?
Cat got your tongue?
Please, I never hurt you.
ScarFace, he's another person.
Not me, really.
But he's inside you somewhere.
And I'm going to keep scratching until I find him.
Don't make it harder on yourself.
- He cost me my freedom.
- No. You gave it up.
I suspected there was more to this business than you were telling.
So I put a transmitter on your cat back at your apartment.
It led me here in time to hear your confession.
- Why did you do it, Selina?
- I have to be who I am.
I realize now I can't change that.
Like I told someone else tonight...
...it's just the cat in me.
It's priceless, Batman. The last of its kind.
Will you take me in or let it become extinct again?
The lady or the tiger, darling.
Your choice.
I am the cat who walks by herself.
[ENGLISH]
He is, without a doubt, one of the greatest contemporary artists alive today.
And he gives life to garbage.
He abuses strange materials.
And he has attracted huge crowds to his exhibitions.
Vik Muniz, come on down!
When I said he's one of the greatest artists alive,
I'm not exaggerating.
I really believe that, and everyone agrees.
There is just no doubt about it.
Can you tell us how you came to use materials from the garbage?
Once I was driving in Sao Paulo...
I see a fight.
I stop to break the fight apart.
When I am going back to my car...
I got shot by one of the guys who
Thought was the guy fighting with him.
Sorry I have to do this.
Luckily he was very rich... and he gave me some money.
And that's why I bought the ticket... to come to America in 1983... and that's why
I am talking to you today.
Because I got shot in the leg.
Oh my God, this is so amazing!
I really feel weird.
This is very very strange.
I used to push these carts here.
Now, they have these things for the carts.
In my time, they had no thing which can return your cart.
One of my jobs was to clean up... after the dumpster.
From the meat dumpsters.
I would spend the whole day... shoveling the worst possible matter... organic matter left by the truck.
Sugar Children was probably the most important work... of my career.
I think this is the first time that I addressed... the fact of material as something that exists... in the world with its own importance.
These are children from the Caribbean island, of St. Kitts.
They are sons and daughters of plantation workers.
I would imagine the progression from these beautiful amazing children... to a grown, that would be just as happy... because it was paradise.
But their parents were very sad, tired, weary people... who worked 16 hour shifts in the sugar fields.
I kept thinking about what was missing in the transition... from a childhood like that to being very sad grownups.
And it was sugar.
The sweetness was taken from those children.
When I came back to New York
I started drawing their faces with sugar...
I realized that I could make volumes with that.
It was quite beautiful.
I shot these with a camera.
People from the New York Times... wrote a review about it and later, the Museum of Modern Art... invited me to be part of the new photography show.
So it changed my career entirely... the work that I did with these children.
Right now,
I am this point in my career... that I am trying to step a little bit away... from the realm of fine art.
Because I think that it is a very exclusive... very restrictive place to be.
What I really want to do is to be able to change... the lives of a group of people... with the dame materials that they deal with every day.
And not just any material.
The idea I have for my next series... is to work with garbage.
When you talk about transformation... this being the stuff of art... transforming material and ideas...
I don't know.
This is the beginning of an idea...
I just have the material.
And I have to go after an image.
Hey Fabio.
So did you have a chance to look at that garbage thing?
Yes... check the link I just sent you.
On You Tube there is a video that was shot at this place called Gramacho.
Gramacho Gardens it's the biggest landfill in Rio.
They receive the trash from all the Rio area.
What are the dangers of working in a place like this?
First of all, the place is surrounded by favelas... owned by the drug traffic.
And I think the stability of the people themselves... they are all excluded from society.
Some stay there overnight... or the whole week.
It's gonna be hard.
So do you think it is too hard?
No, because it would be much harder to think we are not able... to change the life of these people.
And I think we are.
So I think it's worth a try.
My experience with mixing art... with social projects... is that is the main thing... is taking people away even if it is for two minutes... away from where they are.
And showing them another world... another place.
Even it's just a place from where they can look at where they are...
You know it just changes everything.
I want this to be an experience of how art... can change people... but also...
Can it change people?
Can this be done?
And what would be the effects of this?
This is where I am going to spend the next two years of my life.
And your going to make drawings out of the garbage?
And your going to employ the people that live there?
And work there?
How is it going to be the whole health issue... if you work with them?
It is not exactly safe to do what they do.
They don't question it, because they feed from there.
Yeah, but we do.
It's hard to make those assumptions from looking at Google Earth.
We have to go there and see what they really need.
And you are going to create everything?
I want also... the iconography to develop from my interaction with them.
See what is important to them.
What would they like to make an image big?
What would they like to show?
Maybe it will end up just being portraits.
But do you think people they are open to work like this?
I have no idea.
These are the roughest... people you can think of, all drug addicts.
It's like the end of the line.
Check out the geography of this thing.
This is the end of the line...
This is where everything that is not good goes.
Including the people.
We are working with the type of individuals that... are in Brazilian society, not different than garbage itself.
The most poisonous thing in Brazilian culture and society, is classicism.
It's horrible how people really believe... and I am talking about educated people...
They really believe they are better than other people.
You see?
It's all recycling industry around here.
People all dealing with garbage.
Every single lot is filled with garbage.
And you see people are carrying garbage?
It's like a garbage land.
People look at us in a funny way,
"What the hell are we doing here?"
I see the hill.
Oh shit.
Oh my God.
It's like a mountain.
Where are we exactly?
Right here.
Hi Lucio, I'm Vik.
Pleasure to meet you.
Hi, how are you doing?
What's really impressive... is that it's the largest landfill in the world.
Yes, it's the largest landfill in terms of the volume of trash received daily.
The ground underneath here is all soft.
The landfill is like a plate of jell-o.
If you keep adding to it without careful balancing... it will sink here or collapse there.
You can see what they're recycling over there.
And it's separate there.
Cardboard, paper, plastics, glass, metal - they collect everything.
It works like a stock exchange.
They collect whatever the market demands at any given time.
So the recycling wholesalers tell the pickers what they need... and then that's what they collect.
Yes, that's right.
They sell the materials right here at the landfill.
And then it goes to the recycling wholesalers, the intermediaries.
There they process it, removing the bottle caps and so on.
From there it goes to another company for shredding.
The shredded material gets sold again... to companies who mold it into car bumpers, buckets, etc.
The pickers take out 200 tons of materials per day from the landfill.
- Every day.
- Every day.
That's equivalent to the garbage produced by a city of 400,000 people.
- Amazing!
- Yeah.
So that's why the pickers are really important to the landfill... because they help increase its capacity.
Does all of Rio's trash end up here?
70% of Rio's trash ends up here... and 100% of the closest suburbs.
So the garbage from the millionaire's mansion mixes... with the garbage from the poorest favela?
For sure.
Dude!
Dude, It's a city of garbage!
It's funny how you get used to the smell.
Yeah, I feel right at home!
- Did you hear that one?
- No.
That guy said, "They're filming for Animal Planet!"
It's not as bad as I thought.
Here we are in the largest sanitary facility... in the world.
And the people are talking.
And I don't see people depressed or anything.
They seem very proud of what they are doing.
We better get out of here.
What you see up there... it looks very chaotic, but it's very organized by material... and by the company that picks it up and takes it to the recycling.
He's the radio.
Enjoying the game?
The pickers who sort through the garbage.
I learned here is that they have... there own choices of solid garbage of recyclable garbage.
Women for instance they prefer recyclable plastic... and soft drink bottles... and disposable plastic because it's lighter.
This is where the trucks stop?
Yeah the trucks give us a ride up here.
And you each take your own barrels with you?
Yeah, we have to buy them.
They cost US$30.
What's your name?
Isis Rodrigues Garros.
- Isis Rodrigo?
- Rodrigues.
Let me get a portrait of you two.
Do it again.
Thank you.
- Bye, thank you.
- Bye, Isis.
How about with my hair down?
Film her!
Film her!
What a show-off!
- Bye, thanks everyone!
- Bye Isis.
Let me introduce you to Zumbi.
His nickname is Zumbi.
He's on the board of the Association of
Pickers of Jardim Gramacho, ACAMJG.
We have to think about the future... because I don't want my son to be a picker.
Although if he is,
I'd be very proud...
But I'd rather he be a lawyer, to represent the pickers, you know?
Or a doctor to care for the pickers in the association.
We're here representing the 3,000 pickers of Jardim Gramacho.
There is still no recycling collection in the city.
You haven't even built anything and you want to sell off the land.
The federal government gave us that land to build a recycling center.
Thanks to the pickers... we built a recycling center without a single cent from the city.
And now you are pretending that we don't exist!
We're going to start a hunger strike here in front of the mayor's office.
Hunger strike!? Yeah, right!
I don't know about you guys, but I'm having lunch at noon!
Is it here?
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Sebastião?
- I'm Vik, a pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure, I'm Tião.
- This is Fabio.
- Hi Fabio, how are you?
I'm the Brazilian artist who is the most - I hate to say this... but who sells and is the most popular overseas.
Congratulations man!
I grew up very poor, but now I've reached a point where I want to give back.
I want to make portraits of the pickers and then sell them.
All the money from the sale of the portraits will be given back to you.
You'll be able to do some things to make life easier for the community.
When we started this association, everyone laughed at us.
"You're crazy, that's not going anywhere!"
"Association for what? You're never going to achieve anything."
Everybody criticized us. Even the pickers, they were the worst.
They said it wouldn't lead anywhere, that it would never work.
I believed in it.
I said no.
Now I believe when you put your mind to something, you can achieve it.
Take you, for example.
How many people told you to give up, that it was never going to happen?
Yeah, starting with my father, my own father.
He'd say "That's bullshit."
"It's not going to get you anywhere."
When we demonstrated they'd say
"That's not going to get you anywhere."
Well we have paved roads and a sewage system now.
If you went outside right now you'd see children in the street, picking garbage.
We need to change that.
I was lucky because
I had my grandmother, and she taught me to read at a very young age.
Yeah, reading is so important.
Some people are crazy and throw away their books. It's absurd.
One time Zumbi brought me a book and he almost cried.
He said "Man, this book is still being sold.
I saw it yesterday and it's expensive!"
It looks like someone barely read it and just threw it away.
Wow that's great!
Yeah it's great that Zumbi picks them out of the trash and brings them here!
The other pickers just tear up books and recycle them.
But Zumbi picks out the good books, and brings them here for us to read.
I collect 'arruivo' meaning books, folders.
Paper.
We have thousands of books... because they're dumped in the landfill all the time.
I have a plan to make a community library in my space.
Up until now, I've been responsible for bringing books to the association.
I've read a few books -
The Da Vinci Code, The Art of War.
And I give a lot of books to Tião.
Shit! Man!
It's good to fly over... so we can see what we are up against.
And it's like this all over.
This is by far the worst I have seen.
It looks like they were completely left.
And the day after we left there... in the afternoon they found a body there.
They can just stick a body there...
And it's going to be under the garbage in 12 hours.
And you become a source of methane gas.
I already see just as a beginning.
I see 3 characters:
Tiao, Zumbi, Isis.
I think we can start... with the people we have already made some contact with.
I think it is the first time I saw... something that you are doing... where it looks better when you are close.
From above... you don't have any of the human factor.
Which so far is the best part of what we encountered there?
Yes.
The human factor there is beautiful really.
From far there is not "desmaios", the people choking.
There was none of that.
They were just like little ants... doing what they do every day.
What?
Hein?
Hold it here for me, please.
Howdy folks!
There's still the card problem.
The fight is long comrade...
- but victory is certain!
- Of course.
It's not bad to be poor.
It's bad to be rich at the height of fame with your morals a dirty shame.
Yeah, yeah.
That's bad!
DANGER. RISK OF LIFE.
- This is Valter dos Santos.
- Good morning!
- Hi! I'm Vik, Vik Muniz.
- I'm Valter dos Santos.
What is this and why are you doing it?
We are making portraits of the picker.
Because the picker is a person... like this garbage, that nobody knows about.
Very well, so from what I understand,
I think this is very good for us... because it will raise awareness about us pickers.
- Isn't that about right?
- Exactly.
I hope you understand me because I don't have... either a primary or a secondary education.
You didn't ask me, but
I'm going to introduce myself.
I like introducing myself with my own voice.
I have been a picker here for 26 years.
I am proud to be a picker.
I'm the Vice President of ACAMJG... the Association of Pickers of Jardim Gramacho.
I represent 2,500 pickers who work here at the landfill.
I carry this with pride.
Let's say each household generates one kilo of garbage.
And one kilo of garbage generates
500 grams of recyclable material.
So a thousand homes generate 500 kilos... of material that could be recycled.
That's 500 kilos less of material that would pollute the rivers, the lagoons... that won't clog the sewers or be buried here in the landfill... doing such great harm to nature and the environment.
I try to explain to people... what they can recycle and what they can compost... and what they should do.
People sometimes say
"But one single can?"
One single can is of great importance.
Because 99 is not 100, and that single one will make the difference.
I feel disgusting.
I can't believe you want to show me all dirty.
So tell me Isis, how long have you worked here?
- Five years.
- Five years?
And what's it like working here?
- Really bad. Awful.
- Really bad?
You don't like it?
Look Vik, it's Vik, right?
This isn't a future.
But you make good money here, right?
Yes, I make US$20-$25 a day.
Beautiful!
That's right!
Very good!
It really is very good.
Think about what you're going to do when you get out of Gramacho.
When you're rich and famous.
I met someone.
And today I am in love with him.
He is a truck driver.
It's just that...
I can't talk about it or I'll start to cry.
It's been 2 weeks since we broke up.
I really like him.
He was a good thing in my life.
But it's been two weeks since we broke up.
I got a tattoo of his name on my leg.
And you won't get back together?
I don't think so.
Why did you break up?
It ended because... he was married.
And so it ended.
Look out! Get out of the way!
I have nothing to complain about in my life.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Oh, man, if I complained
God would punish me.
Tell him what you want be.
I want to be a doctor.
What kind a doctor?
A psychologist.
Did you know that psychologists take care of crazy people?
- Yeah.
- No, that's not true.
No? So what do psychologists do?
There was a woman there who was blonde.
Oh. Beto's wife!
And she told me that if I wanted
I could be a psychologist.
So that's why I want to be a psychologist.
It's ruiet now because there are no wars between the favelas.
But when there are wars between the favelas... you can be sure that a lot of dead bodies will be dumped here.
There are always weird things here.
Marat!
Yeah, who's Marat?
- Marat was an intellectual...
- Oh, like me.
Nobody else likes the guys I like.
I like Machiavelli.
Machiavelli's cool.
- Who I really like is Nietzsche.
- What about Nietzsche?
Nietzsche's got a great philosophy on life.
Let's make Tião into Marat.
He died in the bathtub like this.
- Bring that bathtub!
- I'm going to play a dead guy.
One time I was walking in the garbage and I came across this book.
It was all muddy and on it was written
"The Prince" by Machiavelli.
I felt like reading it so I took it home and put it behind the fridge to dry.
When it dried out I began to read.
Machiavelli wrote about all of the princes of his day.
That time period in Florence, that madness... it reminds me a lot of Rio today, all these different fiefdoms... each with their own gangs and their own fortifications.
I got really into it.
He talks about Moses, who became leader because God talked to him.
And Cesare Borgia, because of the corrupt pope.
That was when I was becoming
President of the Association.
I learned a lot.
Be careful!
You can get further in, and sit up a bit more.
My legs will stick out.
- You can bend them.
- We'll cut that out.
He's like this.
That's it.
This piece of paper is in the left hand.
This hand.
That's it exactly! That's right!
- Got it!
- Thank you, Tião!
Very cool, man!
Do you want juice?
Coffee?
This is beef stew, rib stew.
Here's boiling water to make pasta.
Hand me that bag!
When the market produce ends up here in boxes, it's easier for me.
I get potatoes and vegetables.
The drivers from the supermarket trucks bring me clean vegetables.
If the meat truck comes, the boys get it before the expiration date.
I am a trained cook, a restaurant cook.
In this garbage I make many things.
I make salads, potato, roast beef.
When I can get a good cut of meat,
I roast it for them.
And them they get silly and sing me happy birthday, even though it isn't my birthday.
We feel good in here.
I feel very good.
Even if it rains,
I get the fire running to cook.
I don't let anyone go hungry.
- Just like that.
- Like that?
That's right, but face me!
Don't put this on TV, I'd die.
I first came here almost a year ago.
My husband became unemployed.
And we had to pay the bills, keep the household, support my son.
We would get on the bus, and people would go like this.
It's quite a perfume!
It got to the point where I'd say:
Excuse me ma'am, but do I stink?
Do you smell something bad?
It's because I was working over there in the dump.
It's better than turning tricks in Copacabana.
I find it to be more interesting and more honest.
It's more dignified.
I stink now, but when I get home
I'll take a shower, and it'll be fine.
But it's disgusting.
It's easy for you to be sitting there at home in front of your television... consuming whatever you want and tossing everything in the trash... and leaving it out on the street for the garbage truck to take it away.
But where does that garbage go?
That's it.
We go along.
The fight is expensive.
We have a great value.
Come on boy!
Come here and get your hands dirty.
When you go to get your money you don't say it's dirty.
Easy there. Let's go.
Come on, come on!
Fabio, we need to see what material you're going to use.
Ok, so the easiest thing to decide is the carnival stuff.
Costumes and things like that?
Costumes and things because clear glass is no of no use for me.
But green champagne bottles, brown beer bottles, costumes... you could collect things like that for me.
Are we going to do it by weight or by tarpful?
How do we do it? They told me that a tarp cost US$0.40 per kilo?
Per kilo, yeah.
And they said that one cost US$0.70 cents?
Yes, US$0.71 cents.
This is PET. When it makes that noise you know it's PET.
That for example is not PET, it's PP. It's the most expensive.
And what about brown glass?
Glass we have to pick specially, we normally don't pick glass.
- No?
- No, normally we don't.
- Do you have a price for it?
- Glass is US$0.06 cents per kilo.
- Six cents? It's cheaper than PET?
- Yeah, it's a lot cheaper.
- But it's a lot heavier.
- But it's a lot heavier.
What's all that mixed up over there, bottles, that hoses...
That's all PVC.
PVC is almost all made up of different objects.
Right.
There are jellies.
X-rays.
PVC is what I will use the most.
It gives you the feeling of being "everything".
Of objects.
For me PVC is the filet mignon
Definitely.
And I'll use the PET and glass more as filler.
To fill it up.
- Just white Paper.
- PET, metals.
Just white paper.
Watch the truck!
Here it comes!
Watch the truck!
Before coming to the landfill, we had a calm life.
My mother still lived with my father.
I was the oldest and I had two younger brothers.
But then my father died.
You're sowing, throwing grain like this.
- I'm sowing.
- Yeah.
This hand here can be relaxed and open.
My mother was struggling.
We heard about Jardim Gramacho.
My mother came here, and then I came too.
I started to help her out.
I was nine years old.
My mother worked here for a while, but then she died as well.
Once, I was collecting here on the ramp... when the gate of the garbage truck fell off.
It fell on me, and started to drag me and crush me...
I broke my leg, my arm.
I fractured a rib.
I broke my other arm here.
I was in really bad shape.
If it weren't for my friends here...
Over 20 people donated blood.
It was great for the hospital because their blood bank was filled.
People here gave me a lot of support.
It's better than during the day, there are less people.
It's better than being out there... like a lot of people, prostituting yourself.
We are working honestly.
We're earning our living.
I've worked since I was seven years old.
Now I'm 18.
I eat what I find around here.
I take it from the truck.
Yogurt comes along, whatever comes along, I eat it.
If I don't die, it's not bad.
I can get by.
We see things that aren't pleasant.
Like the other day I went up there and something made me throw up...
There was a baby there that had been thrown away.
I fell over backwards.
I immediately thought of my own kids.
- It was dead?
- Yes.
Rent is US$8 per week.
If you are late and pay on Monday it's US$13.
I go home to see my kids every couple of weeks.
Sometimes I'll just go and come back on the same day.
My daughter is three years old, my son is almost two.
Their father is a drug dealer.
If I counted on him, I'd be screwed.
Sometimes I get visitors, the rats.
They run around in the roof.
It drives me crazy.
I run out of here screaming.
Even when they're asleep, they annoy me.
They fall off the roof onto the bed sometimes.
Bye.
- Leaving already?
- Yes.
My daughter caught a fungus.
My mother also got the fungus.
The thing covered her foot.
It messed up her whole foot.
She ended up staying at home and taking care of my kids.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
I would like to take care of children.
I really love children, my own as well as other people's.
If it was up to me,
I'd open a day care center.
There are so many children.
Come here you beautiful thing.
How are you?
Come here you beautiful thing.
Give mommy a kiss!
Give me a kiss!
And you? Are you OK?
No?
No?
What's going on?
And you? Are you OK?
Here is our kitchen.
It's small, but you can still make a little something in it.
We make food on that stove.
Here is the living room where we put a bunc of junk.
The bathroom is here.
Oh this bathroom is bad, cut the bathroom.
Here's the bedroom.
This isn't a bed, it's really just a chest of drawers.
We improvised and put the mattress on top.
Everyone sleeps piled up here.
Here's the most recent baby of the house.
TV. Fan.
I moved here after
I split from their father.
He beat me and I got so hurt,
I had to get out of there.
And there was no other way to survive, so I stayed here.
She is my eldest and she took care of the kids so I could work.
We had to survive somehow.
After a while, we all had to go to the garbage.
There was no one to leave them with, so I brought them with me.
I moved in with their father when I was twelve.
I'm proud of my work... because at least I'm not involved with the drug traffic... or prostituting myself, like a lot of pretty girls around here do.
They could be trying to achieve something in life, but no.
They prefer to throw themselves out there onto the street... prostituting themselves.
Right there.
Magnetic tape.
Is that film?
Yes, there are a lot of rolls up there.
I'm going to be Mona Lisa.
What's that?
It has be a woman of a certain age to wear shoes like that.
She must have worked as an executive, right?
To work in a shoe with a pointy toe like that?
Here's a tape.
They must have a camera.
- A camera film.
- And they've got a computer.
This trash is totally middle class.
Wait a minute, Playboy?
"Dear Subscriber... you are now part of an exclusive club that receives Playboy... the best men's magazine in the country."
This guy liked...
And then he died.
This guy didn't have a lot of money.
This one here?
This comes from poor people because it comes in little bags.
- "Poor is the trash of the poor."
- I put my trash in little bags too.
To think you guys have gone through my trash.
Actually I like this picture.
What we should do now is get rid of... is choose the best pictures.
This one.
So good.
Yeah, I love it too.
Super super strong.
This is super strong.
This is super strong, also.
I love Isis and Suelem but these shots aren't quite right.
We can shoot them in the studio also.
Yeah, it's not a problem.
- How's it going?
- What's up?
How are you?
Everyone who goes to a museum, goes up to a painting... and then they stop and start to go like this.
Have you seen this?
Everyone does it.
- Are they drunk?
- It looks like it.
They go like this, and then they go back... maybe take a little step back.
And then they see the image.
Imagine it's a beautiful landscape with a lake and a man fishing.
They look and see the man fishing... and they lean in an everything vanishes and becomes paint.
They see the material.
They move away and see the image.
They get closer and see the material.
They move away and see the idea.
They get closer and see just the material.
Since we're pickers, we just see recyclable materials.
- It earns money.
- But that's interesting...
You have one point of view.
I got it what this can do with people.
I bet you people stay much longer at your exhibits than anyone does.
They'll spend so much time looking at the image... because then they'll see the ladder, the piano.
They'll look at everything.
They'll spend hours looking at the same picture.
When one thing turns into another is the most beautiful moment.
A combination of sounds transforms into music.
And that applies to everything.
That moment is really magical.
Looks good.
You want to dress up like mommy, in a sheet?
Let me see here. You're going to be just like a little saint.
You're going to sit here.
Move your legs a bit, is that ok?
That's it.
Didn't it come out beautifully?
This whole area will be filled in with stuff.
And it will be clearer at the sides.
Exactly.
When you are placing the materials, follow the shadows of the picture.
Did you just do this one?
Do the same thing with the shorter one.
I want to close this here and see if it makes more sense like that.
See this line going up...
Is there a way to take something away here?
Take off one more.
That's it.
Brooke de Ocampo, Isis.
- Hi, how are you?
- Suelen.
Hi.
This is Magna.
- Hi.
- How are you?
Brooke has a super important job at an international auction company.
So we're going to make a really big photograph of this.
And she's already agreed to take it to an international sale.
There'll be a guy with a hammer, going, going, going, gone.
Suelen and her two kids.
It all started by the feeling that we should do something... that will convert back to them.
We'll make something out of garbage... and it would be sold for a lot of money.
And it will become something they would put their hands on to help them.
And in the end, they won't say:
"Vik did it.
Right.
- We did it.
- Right.
I had just arrived from the bank and given the money to Gloria.
I was standing by the door and I saw him and another man coming towards us with a pointed gun.
They told us not to move.
And they took everybody's wages.
How much money was there?
Six... US$6,000.
I keep asking myself if it's worth it.
And the comission?
Sometimes I just feel like giving up on all of this.
I don't want to be here anymore.
The presents are this small.
Try making it gradually darker from here to here, does that make sense?
Good work everyone.
It came out beautifully!
That's not garbage, it's recyclable material, it's money.
A lot of money.
Oh man that's crazy.
It looks exactly like me.
Oh, my! Man!
I never imagined
I'd become a work of art.
Take a look.
See?
That's me?
Yes ma'am, that's your arm.
It's this photo right here.
You're looking in that direction...
- that's your arm.
- I see.
Everything is made out of recyclable materials from the landfill.
I see. How charming!
It's so well done. Excuse me while I have a look over here.
- Come on, come on, look.
- My God.
Let's see if I understand it right.
Oh yes. I understand!
Here's the arm.
I understand.
It's all recyclable materials.
Look at this.
As far as you can see.
You see huge buildings.
It becomes sort of a textural thing.
You lose that sense of scale.
It starts to look small... and like it's just like hair.
It's not a pretty place.
Except when you look from very far away.
This is where I grew up.
Every time we talk about some friend... that lived here... then we say "oh he died!"
So many of them died.
They died from drug traffic... or they died from all kinds of stuff.
That used to be my room... when I was a kid.
Now it's just the guest room.
There was always a lot of humidity on the walls... because Sao Paolo is very rainy all the time.
I used to have my bed here... and there were all these stains.
I used to make a diary... of how the stains would develop.
This used to be a very rough neighborhood.
Now it's becoming sort of a low... low middle class neighborhood.
But it's safe... and people can live here decently.
I was never... ashamed of being poor.
And I was always proud of my parents.
I bought this lot in 1963, and I built this house with difficulty.
When I moved here it was dirt, there were no paved roads, nothing.
There was no running water, no sewage.
Thanks God, now it's the opposite.
Today we have everything we need.
We got here with some difficulty, but with dignity.
My grandmother brought me up... because my mother... had to work at the phone company.
And my father he worked at night... sometimes he worked two shifts.
This is Ana Rocha... the most important woman... in my life.
She is 93 years old.
I told them you were 70 years old.
That's right.
I'm getting stiff from lying in this position.
Artists have to suffer, don't you know?
Who told you that, Vik?
Honey, I just know.
I'm on the inside now.
Man, you're becoming an artist.
It's all Vik's fault.
Vik's made you conceited,
Vik and Fabio.
That's what they keep saying at home.
It changed a lot of things for me.
I don't see myself
I the trash anymore.
I really don't.
I don't know.
I don't want to go back to the garbage. I don't.
I told Fabio: Just let me stay.
Even if I only get US$150 a month.
But please just let me stay here.
I don't want to go back to the garbage.
A little more in profile.
The sad story is that I lost my son when he was three years old.
I saw my son die when he was three years old.
I was at the hospital with him for three days.
I saw him dying.
Breathing his last breaths and everything.
He had acute pneumonia.
He was throwing up little pieces of his lungs.
They called me to identify my son's body. It was on top of a stone.
It was wrapped in black plastic... with a big sign with his name, Carlos Igor.
I fell over, I fainted.
I couldn't believe that it was my son.
I asked them to take the plastic off because he was too hot.
After that my husband left me and he took my daughter away from me.
She's eight now, when my son died she was two.
I never saw her again.
Not since she was two.
I forgot my life,
I forgot everything,
I forgot that I had a life, a house, everything.
I started going out all the time.
The only thing I didn't do was do drugs, thank God.
But I started going out and drinking and getting wasted.
I started drinking moonshine all the time.
My son was so beautiful, he was very beautiful.
I lost the last photograph I had of him.
It was in my wallet that was stolen.
But I don't forget anything.
I don't forget the tiniest details.
At the morgue, there was a little ant crawling on his face because of the flowers.
I made a scene to get that ant off my son's body.
I don't forget a single detail not a single, single one.
- Come my dear.
- Thank you.
I'll print a photograph for you.
No.
Isis, you're not supposed to cry.
Come here.
Thank you.
- Did you like it?
- Yes.
Remember that first day at Jardim Gramacho?
Did you think that that lunatic... with the camera was going to do something like this?
Not in my wildest dreams.
I think we have to be careful... because I really can see already... how delicate the whole situation of having them there... is for them.
For their minds.
They totally forgot about Gramacho.
They don't want to go back.
At the beginning at least I had the impression... and now I think this is wrong... that they were happy there.
And I think that it has a lot to do with denial.
I think that is where you reach the point where you think about... should you take them to London?
I think it's quite a...
It's a super delicate question.
If you are starting to change them already... just bringing them to the other studio... just involving them in a different lifestyle... in Rio... what's going to happen to them once you take them... once you put them on a plane?
You were saying oh this is going to mess with their minds.
Well, maybe... their minds need to be messed up with.
But if take them... and say hello life is different... you can do this, you could do that...
Is it realistic enough...
What can they do... with that afterwards here?
It is really hard for me to imagine doing something... that would do much damage to them.
Do worse than what has been done to them already.
Why do you have to take somebody's life and change it forever?
As long as you think the person can cope with it.
Afterwards.
But if you are not sure the person can deal with it...
People are fragile.
It is my responsibility.
That's what I think.
Your responsibility.
But let me answer that.
Let me talk.
Let me answer that!
You don't let me talk.
You're saying it is not my responsibility...
He doesn't let me talk!
I am saying it is.
Let me for one moment... think about something else here.
These guys are going to the studio... and they are saying...
"I don't want to go back to Gramacho."
Is that something bad one way or another?
No that's good.
Isn't this good?
Maybe they will have to go and they will have to think... of a plan to get out of there.
They get to see another reality.
And that changes their way of thinking.
It's hard for me.
It changes their way of thinking.
It does.
For some people it changes their way of thinking... for some people... they just go to bed better... because they think they did something.
I don't think if I was a catador in Jardim Gramacho... and somebody said to me listen do you want to come do this thing... work two weeks... in an artists studio... making a portrait of yourself... and by the way we may take you to a foreign country... but at the end of all of this... you'll be back here... collecting garbage... would you like to come?
I know that I would say yes.
Got it.
A year of garbage has gone by.
Let's go.
Here's wisdom a plenty, nineteen is not twenty.
99 is not 100.
Hi Vik.
It's the Marat that's going?
It's going to be great.
I'm already dreaming about being there.
I'm going to London, and you're not.
Hey what are you doing here man?
Check out that long hair!
There's so much excess.
There's so much excess that it becomes art.
Check out the garbage bag.
Except you can't open it, it's made of bronze.
Painted bronze.
Can you tell what's in there?
There are definitely yogurt cups, hearts of palm.
Some boxes.
Looks like someone bought a new cell phone and threw away the box.
- It looks like I could just pick it up.
- It's great.
This was made by a British artist named Gavin Turk.
This guy is a really great artist too.
He used to sleep on the streets.
His name is Jean-Michel Basquiat.
This was done by the guy who is the most expensive living artist,
Damien Hirst.
It's a pharmacy.
Yeah, just drugs on a shelf.
Just drugs.
It will probably go for about one million dollars.
Dermatological cream.
It is a very fine work.
There is strong demand for works... by Vik Muniz.
So I do hope obviously that his risk... is going to pay off.
It's going to work out.
Let’ see.
It's going to work, come on.
It's a very bold step... for Vik Muniz... to consign a work... directly to an auction.
In the past... artists would go through... what you call... the primary market.
They would be sold for the first time... in a gallery.
Thank you.
Lot number 225...
Nine Multi-colored Marilyns... by Andy Warhol
Are you nervous?
I'm really nervous.
Even when Botafogo plays for the championship.
I don't get this nervous.
Hold on.
Last chance.
Sold. What's your number?
Thank you so much.
It's now, it's now.
Lot number 272.
The great work by Vik Muniz.
Mahrat Sebastião...
Pictures of Garbage
And we will start this... at ten thousand pounds.
10 thousand pound.
12 thousand pounds.
14 thousand pounds.
16 thousand pounds.
18 thousand pounds.
20 thousand pounds.
At the far back now.
20 thousand pounds.
20 thousand pounds
22 thousand pounds.
There is a new bit
25 thousand pounds.
25 thousand pounds.
Against you, Jenny.
At 25 thousand.
28 thousand pounds.
At 28 thousand.
It's against Diego now... at 28 thousand pounds.
It is at the far back of the room... at 28 thousand pounds.
Sold.
The most important thing is what you're going to do with this.
It was all worth it. Everything I did up until now was really worth it.
Why do you think you are here?
Because once a friend and I had a dream of creating an association.
We created the association.
It was a crazy dream.
Nobody believed in us.
Not even my family.
Nobody believed in me.
This is only the beginning Tião.
This is only the beginning.
I am so happy.
Are you happy?
God was so good to me, so wonderful.
You're the strong one.
You are doing everything.
Mom.
We sold it mom.
We sold it for US$50,000.
US$50,000.
I feel like a pop star.
Full.
Yeah.
Now presenting Lenny Kravitz.
I want to propose a toast to my boss.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Careful. This woman is red hot.
Tell me what's changed for you.
I was married and now I am separated.
But isn't that bad?
Not at all. It's wonderful.
I started to see myself.
Your own beauty?
No as a person really.
Because before I was just like a little mule.
This job was great. It was really good and important to me.
I knew how much I made.
We would weigh the material every day.
We supposedly worked together, but my share was always less.
He thought
I should be submissive.
But it doesn't work like that.
That was the biggest change in my life.
That's what this job brought to me.
The will to change.
So that's the story, this work brought me this realization.
What did you think of modern art before you went to the auction?
I used to think it was crap.
Why'd you think it was crap?
Because I think a lot of things aren't really art.
Why don't you think it's art?
Because you don't get it?
Because I don't get it and it's totally meaningless.
But do you think you have to get it, for it to be art?
I think it has to communicate something at least.
After you told me the story about...
Jean-Michel.
Jean-Michel Basquiat.
Yeah, I started liking his stuff a lot more.
I began to understand his kind of sinister style.
It's a bit childish, like monsters.
I started to understand it and I liked it.
But if you're saying you liked it better after you understood it... then maybe we just don't like things we don't understand.
Of course, you can dislike something because you haven't tried it.
For example, you were always trying to explain what you were doing... but I never understood.
Until you saw it?
I only understood it when Fabio brought me up here.
Then I got what you crazy people were up to.
Then I really got it.
The crazy people are the ones who buy it.
They're not crazy. It's beautiful.
I'd buy it.
I'll buy it someday.
I'll buy my picture back.
- Bye Betania.
- Bye.
Hello.
You look like you're getting married.
Who would marry me?
That's it.
Watch the glass.
Oh my God.
Look, it's me.
So good.
I did the iron, remember?
I did this.
I did this.
Look it's Zumbi.
It's so beautiful.
Suelen. It's so vibrant.
Look it's you.
Check out the profile.
It's beautiful.
Check out, Auntie.
I did this.
- You made the pot.
- I did this.
I was a picker at Jardim Gramacho.
I was picking garbage when they asked me to work with them.
They liked my look, my style.
At that point,
I didn't even know what this was.
It's really worthwhile to work on behalf of the pickers... to become recognized as an official sector... of the recyclable materials industry.
And it's also worthwhile becoming a work of art.
We support ourselves with this material.
And we managed to transform that material into art... and into the opportunity to be in the Museum of Modern Art.
I've never been to a museum.
I never dreamed there would be a picture of me in a museum.
Sometimes we see ourselves as so small... but people out there see us as so big, so beautiful.
There she is. You look so fancy.
Are you happy?
Very happy.
Don't cry, Sister.
Now's the time to be happy.
I'd rather want everything and have nothing... than have everything and want nothing.
Because at least when you want something your life has a meaning, it's worthwhile.
From the moment you think you have everything you have to search for meaning in other things.
I spent half my life wanting everything and having nothing.
And now I have everything and
I don't want anything.
These days I'm starting to see things in a simpler way.
I don't have as much material ambition as I used to.
When I was poor I only wanted material things.
I just wanted to have things.
I had to buy a lot of crap to get rid of that complex.
I knew that I could do the work.
Bt I did not count as being as involved... with the people that I was working with as I did.
It just was impossible not to.
I thought I could just go there... and paint Jardim Gramacho... like Cezanne went to paint...
Monte Saint-Victoire.
You know be cool about it.
And try to just do my work... and look at it as a representation.
It's not.
It's a lot more than that.
Because it has it's human side... that a picture can not really translate.
It could be me.
I mean from the stories... these people tell... a lot of them they were low middle class people... that for some unfortunate event... they just ended up having to go there and live in the garbage.
I was born in a low... middle class house hold in Brazil.
If something had happened to my parents...
I could be led to a life like that.
If you can put yourself in their own shoes... if your living life... and figuring out what to do to just continue living... it's very hard.
But on the other hand... when you see the appetite for life... these people have... and the way they carry themselves... it inspires you.
I start thinking about... how to help people and all of a sudden...
I feel very arrogant.
Who am I to help anybody?
Because in the end...
I feel like I am being helped more than they are.
Even if everything went wrong... you could still be like them.
And they're beautiful.
They're great people.
They just weren't very lucky... but we're going to change that.
I can't believe it.
What's this, man?
Hang this on these humble walls, this work of art?
You can't even hang a picture right.
Check it out.
It's your dad.
That's it.
That's beautiful.
Right next to my mother-in-law.
Look who's it is.
Is it you?
I have to get a nail.
I'm shaking.
It's so beautiful. It's me, it's me.
I love it.
You have no idea what this means to me.
When I went to work there,
I was too ashamed to tell anybody.
I tried to hide it from my family the best I could.
After I worked with Vik Muniz...
I went to everybody and told them I worked at the landfill.
It was one of life's consequences.
And I was no longer ashamed.
This image has traveled all over.
To China, Japan.
I didn't go, but it did.
I'm famous out there.
When I saw it being made, it was very big.
Now it got smaller.
In the studio it looked huge.
See if it's good.
Here? Here?
Don't scratch my picture.
The back doesn't matter.
You did a good job Vik.
Now you're famous in Santa Cruz.
They're talking about you here.
- Did you do that?
- Yes, with everyone's help.
Remember that big pot I had?
That's the one they used.
You know how I became famous all over the world?
Inside the garbage.
I started there almost thirty years ago.
I like it there.
My life began there, thank God.
I'm famous worldwide because of that place.
That's where everything started for me.
He is President of the Association of
Garbage Pickers of Jardim Gramacho.
And his portrait was a big success at an auction in London.
Tião Santos.
At what age did you start working?
Since I was 11.
- Since you were 11. At the landfill?
- Yes, at the landfill.
- Can I just correct you on one point?
- Of course.
We are not pickers of garbage, we are pickers of recyclable materials.
Garbage can't be reused, whereas recyclable materials can.

Punk music generally, that is, hardcore punk is characterized by its speed.
It has a lot of "fuzz" as musicians call it, cranked into the music, it's high volume, high speed, usually monotone volumes, vocals, uh, characterized by protest type lyrics.
I think a lot of the time that it gets out of hand is because of the speed of the music, which is way above the normal rhythm of a dance.
You know, if you take a four-four disco time signature, you know, just comfortably, you can kind of...
...dance easily to the disco rhythm which is,
I understand,
126 to 132 heartbeats a minute.
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
Whereas the kind of music that the Germs or the Black Flag is playing is upwards of 250,
300 beats a minute.
Which is not comfortable or normal to dance to.
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three...
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
And this is why this dance that you'll see in the film, the Pogo dance, which is, you know, jumping up and down and bouncing off walls and stuff like that.
This kind of an abnormal level of adrenalin.
And uh...
And so sometimes, some violence breaks out.
Wow! Man!
Nowadays, I don't...
I think the kids are,
I don't know, more desperate or something like that or more bored.
Some of the better of the punk bands that developed into, son of, like, folk music.
I don't mean folk music as a traditional folk music.
But the allegory can be drawn in the 60s when protesters used acoustic guitars.
Now, instead of acoustic guitars, you know, they have high-speed,
300 beats a minute speed rock.
And yelling about the same things.
About how their air was poisoned out there.
You know, the air in utopia is poisoned.
You know, the final joke, so...
It's Black Flag.
It's Black Flag.

How much do you make per month, when you, uh... as a performer?
Uh...
- Pretty much nothing.
- BAND MEMBER: Negative.
Negative, yeah, actually.
And I mean
Well, like Greg was saying, we don't make very much off gigs and most of it goes back into, like, the promotion.
And, you know, expenses.
Usually, maybe I could get a meal out of it here and there.
Otherwise, I'll just have to find rich girls and stuff like that.
[LAUGHING]
I can't rent a house because
I owe the gas company money.
I owe the electrical company money.
I owe the telephone company money.

[ALL LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: How come the songs are so fast and short?
They're fast because that's what gets us off, okay?
- That's the energy level.
- Yeah.
And they're short because that's how long the inspiration lasts.
If you take the amount of verses that they have and the amount of lyrics and stuff, they're...
You know, they're as long as any other songs.
PENELOPE: What clubs have you been banned from?
Well, the ones we've been banned from are like, uh,
Bla-Bla Café, The Whiskey,
Gazzarri's, Club 88,
Hong Kong Café.
PENELOPE: Why were you banned?
Um, I don't know.
Somehow we got a...
Well, you know, a lot of people that...
You know, when we play, they get pretty violent.
Some of the clubs, they just aren't used to that.
And we got a bad reputation for some reason and then they kind of...
By the press and by the club owners talking to each other, it kind of spreads around.
PENELOPE: What does Black Flag mean, the word Black Flag?
Um, it means anarchy.
Okay. Here's what it is.
When I was in fucking high school, in Junior High, everybody told me how things were.
And you know, how it...
It just didn't work for me, you know?
It's fucking fucked up like crazy.
PENELOPE: Fucked up, how?
Just things, things didn't work right and I was always bummed out.
- PENELOPE: So?
- So when I got in school,
I mean, I didn't know what was going on.
I didn't have any consciousness of what to do or what and when and where, so I just stayed in school.
I just kept on going because
I didn't have any idea of what to do.
I thought, "Well, okay.
I'll study psycho-biology."
I'm worried about brains and all that shit, you know?
I did brain operations. I did...
You know, put hooks, you know...
I cut open their brains and I put...
Stick little wires in their heads and...
Zapped out pans of them and zapped drugs into them and I watched what they did.
4 did a lot of that.
- PENELOPE: You learned from it?
Yeah, I learned a lot from it.
That's where I came up with all my ideas.
PENELOPE: What do you think of his haircut?
Oh, oh, his haircut.
It's okay.
PENELOPE: Why did you cut your hair like that?
Why did I? 'Cause I'm searching.
- PENELOPE: 'Cause you're what?
-'Cause I'm searching.
[ALL LAUGHING]
He knows where it's...
He knows where it's at now.
I'm looking for something.
In other words, it's the search.
He's tried...
So far he's tried, uh...
He's tried punk rock.
He's tried...
- CHUCK: Jesus.
Jesus.
- No, I'm trying them all.
- Harvey Carson.
[LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: What are you searching for?
I really don't know.
No, I'll know when I find it.
[BOTTLES CLINKING]
You know, I did this because I felt like...
To set myself aside and make myself different, maybe, maybe it would just come to me.
PENELOPE: What is it?
[BAND MEMBERS
HUMMING MEDITATIVELY]
No, that's not it.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Shit!
Okay, this next song...
This is for the LAPD.
We got arrested the other night at Blackie's for playing punk rock music.
They called us
"nuisance in public" or something like that.
Anyway, they put us in jail, and this song is called Revenge.
And it's for them.
[SINGING]
It's not my imagination
We got a gun on my back
Promises you made
Never become fact
We're gonna get revenge
You won't know what hit you
We're tired of being screwed
Don't tell me about tomorrow
Don't tell me what HI get
I can't think of progress
When just around the comer
There's a bed of cold pavement
Waiting for me
Revenge! I'll watch them bleed
Revenge! That's all I'll need
I won't cry if you die!
Die!
We're gonna get revenge
You won't know what hit you
We're tired of being screwed
Revenge!
Revenge!
PENELOPE: Why don't the club owners hire the Germs any more?
Mmm, we do get shows occasionally but it is getting harder.
I think there's a lot of bands now.
And when we were first doing it, there weren't that many bands.
And a lot of the new bands are just more co-operative as far as doing a sedate, safe stage show.
There's no threat of, um...
...an imminent riot.
I've had promoters grab me and shake me and say,
"Stop this show. It's on the verge of becoming a riot."
[DRUMS BEATING]
[PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[GUITAR STRUMS]
DARBY: Find me a fucking beer!
PENELOPE: How did you get the reputation that you have?
I guess we used to do stuff.
I mean, it was good to have that kind of reputation and you know...
But not any more
'cause now we can't play anywhere.
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
PENELOPE: Tell me how is it that you're always getting hurt?
Well, first,
I did it on purpose.
- PENELOPE: Yeah?
- To keep from being bored.
He's come out of shows with huge scrapes and scratches and claw marks all over him and just pouring blood, but it always looks a lot worse than it is.
PENELOPE: What's the worst time that you ever got hurt?
Hmm, The Whiskey.
I cut my foot open.
PENELOPE: What happened?
I came down the stairs to do an encore and then I jumped on half a broken glass like that.
And, like, I had to get
30 stitches.
So I was standing like right in front and...
I was looking at his face and, like, you ended up sitting down on the ground.
And you were holding your foot like this and you looked at it and you just started going...
"Ah!" you know and then you stopped playing and stuff.
And you were running around trying to find your tennis shoes.
[CHUCKLES]
And I had to go to the hospital with blue hair and stuff and they were bringing all the nurses in and stuff to look at me.
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
PENELOPE: Why do you get so loaded to perform?
Because that way I don't feel myself getting hurt.
And it's scary out there.
You know, it's real scary, like,
'cause when we play we're right down there in the audience and there's lots of creeps out there.
And there's lots of people that have grudges against you now, too.
And so, if I don't get loaded,
I wouldn't be able to do it.
- Do you want some more coffee?
- I just broke this egg.
Well, we've tried everything,
-to get him to do that.
- To do what?
To sing into the mic.
It's just, like, almost like the enemy or something, stay away from it at all costs, it seems.
PENELOPE: So tell me why you never sing into the mics, Darby?
I just don't pay attention to it, once I'm loaded.
We've tried everything short of gluing his mouth to it.
Yeah, this mic's not working.
Things get broken, monitors, mics, but you kind of have to expect that if you're hiring an energetic young band.
Darby, pick up the mic!
The mic!
One...
[GUITAR FEEDBACK]
[PLAYING RIFF]
[DARBY SINGING]
Well, when they first got together as a band, they didn't know how to play their instruments.
And they did things to, kind of, camouflage that.
Darby would smear peanut butter all over him.
He'd dive through broken glass.
He'd break glasses on his head.
And eventually, they learned how to play.
[PLAYING PUNK SONG]
[SCREAMING]
Oh, you are manly!
[SCREAMING]
PENELOPE: What kind of drugs do you take when you're on stage?
LORNA: What doesn't he?
Anything-
Usually, I do speed or something.
And then that gets too nervous so I do some kind of downers.
Then I start drinking.
4 see.
- LORNA: Give me a beer.
Somebody give me a beer.
Damn it, somebody give me a beer.
A beer, damn it! A beer!
Damn it, one of you give me a beer.
Give me a beer, you fucking...
Well, it's more like... being the mother of four three-year-olds who... are always fighting with each other, but not really seriously fighting.
Just, “He did this to me.
She did this.“
I can't stand it and sometimes I get to the end of my rope and just wanna batter my children.
PENELOPE: What happened to your throat?
We were at some party and we were taking pictures and, um, Shannon had like this switch blade like this and I went like that.
Like this side, just missed my jugular and the Swiss knife just missed my wind pipe.
Do you feel like you wanna quit sometimes?
Oh, yes. Almost all the time.
PENELOPE: Tell me about the painter.
MICHELLE: Oh, the dead painter.
My parents were in China.
And we were just finishing having the house painted.
Coffee.
And Darby and Donny and Dinky and Mark Plummer and my brother were all at my house.
And my brother and I went to take the trash out at, like, one in the morning or something.
And we hadn't been out in the backyard...
It was on a Tuesday, we hadn't been out in the backyard since, um, my parents left, since like the Friday before.
And so, anyways, um,
I went outside and I must have walked right over the guy
'cause I couldn't see anything anyways. [LAUGHS]
And then my brother, my brother goes,
"Isn't there somebody sleeping in the backyard?"
And I just went, "What?
What are you talking about?"
And, um, I went over and looked at him and I was just joking,
I went, "This guy's dead."
And I gave him a kick in the stomach, you know?
And he was dead.
He was dead.
My brother thought we killed him.
He goes, "What should we do?"
Like, "Should we hide the body or something?"
So anyways, um, we went.
And Donny had a camera and we went and we lied down.
I lied down next to him and we all got around him and we took a bunch of pictures, like family pictures and we're all going, "Hi", you know and taking pictures and stuff.
What really happened to the guy?
Um, they think he had a heart attack and fell off the ladder and no one found him for a few days.
[CLEARING THROAT]
It was really funny, actually.
And the paramedics came and they were joking with us.
And the coroner came.
Oh, you remember all those jokes?
Oh, yeah! What was the jokes?
Instead of John Doe, they put down Jose Doe because it was a wet back.
PENELOPE: Didn't you feel bad that the guy was dead?
No, not at all.
Because I hate painters.
[PLAYING SHUTDOWN]
This is Malissa's Song.
Let me
Touch the tips of
Inculcated desire
And brush the fettered
Veil away
Shut down
[MUTTERING]
In the depths I lay
Shut down
In the depths I lay
Shut me
Touch the tips of inculcated
Desire
And brush the fettered
Veil away
Shut down
In the depths I lay
if you want nothing
Then I've got nothing
I'm your fucking
Annihilation man
I don't care about you

Come on, let's bleed
You don't know
How the others chose

Won't you be?
I know all your fantasies
We really bleed
We really mean it
Gonna miss joy
And all that fucking too

One more time
This is Melissa's song!
Shut down
Shut down, go away
In the depths I lay
Go away
In the depths I lay
Go away
Go away
Hey!
Hey!
Go away from here.
Get away from here!
N Now!!
DARBY: Hey, can we do more?
[SCREAMING]
-[WHISTLING]
-DARBY: No more?
ROBERT EGGS'. Slash Magazine began in May of 1977.
It was an idea of Steve Samiof and Melanie Nissen.
And it was basically, at that point, a fanzine
about the local, uh...
Los Angeles bands, garage bands.
And would be better than garage bands.
And the first print run was a thousand as pretty thin paper.
And then it just kept growing until now we're at 20,000, uh, circulation.
[TYPEWRITER CLACKING]
It's a major accomplishment that we come out every month
because there a lot of problems
tugging at the whole thing every month.
I mean, it seems like each month we seem to, uh, alienate
at least one record company by a review
or a band or someone, you know, that's pissed off at us.
And everyone seems to get on everyone else's nerves.
And there are things that happen like one of the contributors got on another one's nerves, so he broke the other guy's collar bone.
And then, uh, another contributor punched out one of our photographers who refuses to contribute any photographs until he gets a written apology.
I have excellent news for the world.
There's no such thing as "new wave."
It does not exist.
It's a figment of, uh... a lame cunt's imagination.
There was never any such thing as "new wave."
It's just a polite thing to say when you are trying to explain you were not into the boring old rock 'n' roll, but you didn't dare to say punk because you were afraid to get kicked out of the fucking party and they wouldn't give you coke any more.
There's new music, there's new underground sound.
There's noise, there's punk, there's power pop, there's ska, there's rockabilly.
But "new wave" doesn't mean shit.
"Hey, I'm writing to you because
"I'm told you're an expert in the field of punk rockers.
"The question I have arises out of an experience I had
"on a recent Saturday on Pico Boulevard.
"As I approached a close-by phone booth, a nasty-looking lad
“who was standing in the middle of the crosswalk.
"He stood there for a few seconds
“while a couple of weirdos ran around
“to the backside of my car
“and attached themselves to my bumper.
“They continued to hang on while! drove away
"and seemed to be enjoying themselves.
"Is it the music they listen to
"that causes them to act this way?
"Sincerely, Confused."
KICKBOY FACE:
We get letters, right?
But we get letters from the hardcore,
from the fanatics, you know?
And the letters we get, it's either, "We love you.
“You're great. You're fantastic.
You saved my life!“
Or you know, "Suck my dick!"
You know, "You pieces of shit!"
"Go back to France, go back to England.
"Go back to Missouri."
I mean, whatever.
And you know, "Shut up!"
"You're horrible."
"You're a bunch of faggots."
"You're a bunch of communists."
"You're a bunch of fascists."
"You're a bunch of sexists."
"We don't like you."
Personally, I've been through one too many youth movements.
[LAUGHING]
- PENELOPE: What are you doing?
- Proofreading.
Are there mistakes in the paper?
Yeah, our typist makes too many mistakes.
Why?
She's a little stoned most of the time.
You'll find little cigarette burns and stuff like that.
[PHONE RINGING]
Yes, Slash Magazine?
There was a riot at the Hong Kong last night?
God, what happened?
Hold on a second.
The firemen got a report saying there were too many people inside?
Uh-huh. And then what did they do?
You mean people thought that the firemen were part of a band?
Why? Because they came out on the stage?
Oh, there were five of them?
[LAUGHS HEARTILY]
Yes. And uh...
And when did everybody find out they were not pan of a band but they were the real thing?
Oh, nobody ever found out?
[LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: Does Kickboy have a lot of enemies?
Uh, I should hope so otherwise
I'm wasting my fucking time.
I mean, I'm not writing, you know, to be pleasant and just have everybody say,
"What a pal!
What a great guy!" You know?
I mean, I'm not using all these fucking hatred and contempt, you know, as a style 'cause
I don't have a style, you know?
I mean, you pick up one article, you pick another article next month and there's no style.
Except it's always overkill so if that's a style, you know...
- The intent is...
- But the intent is to really piss off people that you know,
I really hate and I want to see them dead.
And I really despise everything they stand for, every word they say, the way they live.
And I really want them to hate me.
It makes me feel good.
[CHUCKLES]
CLAUDE:
This is a trendy one here!
[UNDERGROUND BABYLON PLAYING]
Sitting in a room
Surrounded by bottles
My friends have all left
But my head is on fire
it's already morning
But pieces of the night
Are still stuck to my hair
What we did is fading
In the light of the day
What we say is bullshit
We live the modem way
And I guess HI never find out
Which one of you wrote
With a greasy lipstick
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
on the bathroom mirror
on a spotty mattress
I will lay for hours
Adding up all my sins
And inventing new ones
I'm proud of my life
And I stand by my doom
I can't tel! right from wrong
And ifs never stopped me
AH the prophets have died
The books have been written
Salvation in a jar
We'll laugh so hard it hurts
And I guess HI never find out
Which one of you wrote
With a greasy lipstick
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
on the bathroom mirror
I like the taste of guilt
8 know the taste of death
It makes me want to sing
it makes me want to bite
When all the dumbfucks sleep
With their bland little brains
Full of bland little dreams
We try our new curses
Experiment with fear
Experiment with fear
Sit in each others soul
And rehearse our downfall
“Catholic Discipline.“
It's, uh, a graffiti that a couple of years ago when I was... working at the Masque uh, pan time,
I was cleaning up this shit on Monday mornings.
Uh, it's the graffiti that
I found on the mens' room wall in big dripping red letters.
[PEOPLE CLAPPING]
PENELOPE: How do you feel when you're performing?
I feel powerful.
I feel like I'm making an ass out of myself but I'm getting away with it.
That's what I feel like.
There used to be a punk club in Warsaw, Poland.
And they used to send us letters all the time, um, real stilted English and everything.
And then we'd get letters from Madrid, and Tokyo, Sweden, all over the place... about Punk!
[LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: Why do they like it so much?
It's... It's... They gotta do something with their time and it's the most fun so...
Nothing else is going on.
It's the only form of revolution left, I think.
In the 1980s, you know?
KICKBOY: "I felt compelled to speak out against
“all the sniveling, blithering idiots to you.
"Sniveling, bleeding heart liberals,
"who want to shut down nuclear plants in California."
Right.
"I lay odds that the same entire technology of freaks and hippies
"whining about reducing this and waste that
"will be the first on their knees begging
"for nuclear power at the first sign of a blackout
"when their fucking stereos won't come on.
"I say lets get these plants on their feet
“and cranking out some real power.“ Yeah.
“As far as waste goes,
“there are thousands and thousands of miles of ocean
“just sitting there doing nothing.
“So what are we waiting for?
“Throw the plutonium or strutonium 90
“or whatever the hell it is in there,
“along with all the blubbering idiots who can't accept the fact
“that the future is here and they goddamn well
“ought to try and be a pan of it.
"And as far as the animals on the extinct list go,
"they obviously don't have what it takes to make it."
Yeah.
"Survival of the fittest and we are winning. [LAUGHING]
"I say kill them all off.
"And let's start worrying about some real problems instead.
“Now don't get me wrong.
"I love nature as much as the next guy
“but enough is enough.
" And I, for one, have had enough.“
Anyway this is, uh...
This is the way young people feel.
This is a fucking off song so you better be fucking respectful because it's not about much love, it's about a handful of love.
But a handful of love is better than no love at all.
I mean, there's no more brotherhood shit, you know?
PENELOPE: [LAUGHING]
Why not?
It's not like, uh, you know, we're not all grooving on the same vibes any more.
Everybody's grooving on different vibes.
Ugly vibes.
[SINGING] You're so pink
You're so smooth
My Barbie Doll mistress
You're so clean
You're so small
You live in my pocket
We take the bus together
But I just pay for one
We sit by a window
Away from the black kids
I wait a little bit
Then I stick a finger inside
Of my pocket
I rub for your blond hair
And you try to bite me
Tiny bits of plastic
Tiny bits of plastic
Tiny bits of fantastic
Uncontrolled, pressed for more
Barbie doll lust
R's not normal
Barbie doll lust
R's not normal
Barbie doll lust
R's not normal
When no one is looking
I gently pull you out
Holding you by the neck
Your legs between my knees
Your minute eyelashes
Flicker incessantly
While funny pip-squeak sounds
Come from your rosy lips
I pull on your prom dress
Until it rips apart
While someone on the bus
Pukes on an old lady
Pukes on an old lady
"Dissolve and die, lie through your teeth,
"accepting the fact that these masses,
"these perpetual bourgeois never leave
"their happy homes in the suburbs
"and refuse to learn new ideas, they still disgust me.
"Do I belong?
You see them laugh.
"They laugh at themselves and call it comedy.
"They laugh at each other and call it satire.
“They laugh at cripples and call it cruelty.
" Mass middle class laughter permeating every conversation.
"They keep themselves in stitches
“and think they're happy.
“Do not fear the new.
“Must not let this bourgeois
“control the factors of your life.
“Bum the books of poetry for they encourage hope.
“Do not give them purpose for existence.
“Now listen to the fervent cry
“of the bourgeois self-destruction.
"Watch them. Watch them drain their hope and mission.
"Death and destruction.
"I have respect for the middle class.
"I have respect for the mundane.
"I respect the middle class.
I know l am one of them
"and they never let you scream."

Attack their own kind
A thousand kids

There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eyes
Some smooth chords
on the car radio
No hard chords

We set the trash on fire
And watch outside the door
Men come up the pavement
Under the marquee
There's laughing inside
We're locked out of the public eyes

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Oh, okay-
Yeah. Chain from each one, chain from this.
And a chain from the heart to an eight ball.
PENELOPE: Did you think a long time about what kind of tattoo you were gonna get?
If you don't, you're a fool.
Yeah, yeah. I just didn't want to write, you know, like, fuck between my knuckles or some bullshit like that. I mean, I'll be wanting to get...
MAN: That's what
I was going to get.
[LAUGHING]
No, well...
Yeah!
I mean, if I'm going to get a tattoo,
I want it to be cool, you know?
You give a lot of thought about what you're gonna have
'cause you wanna have something stupid but after you get that thing done, then it stands.
PENELOPE: You can look back and say,
"Well, at least l had fun in those times, huh?"
Well, but its not fun.
At least, I had that time.
I can remember that time.
And hopefully, we're together enough to rem ember when we got it.
[LAUGHING]
I'm going to wake up with another funny haircut and more tattoos.
- Are you going to get a tattoo?
- No.
- Why?
- I don't want a tattoo.
How come?
Um...
I don't know.
I just don't want one.
Don't wanna be too trendy.
Two dozen pink roses from The Whiskey.
PENELOPE: For what?
Um...
- MAN: For being so...
- For being cute.
'Cause we do a good job whenever we play there
'cause when we play there, they do better business than anybody else.
They're real happy with us.
They come backstage and talk to us and everything.
They like us, you know?
Anyway, it was real cool when we came in there, it was just this mass of roses.
PENELOPE: Do they do that for everyone?
No! Of course not.
PENELOPE: Where do they come from?
The Whiskey, but I don't know where they got them.
- No, but...
-[HISSES]
PENELOPE: Where did the song
Beyond and Back come from?
Beyond and Back is about sleeping on the couch.
And the word "Beyond"...
The title, Beyond and Back comes from a Bible pamphlet.
There was one called,
Beyond and Back which is what I felt like, to, like, reach this hideous state but then return to normal, you know, normal situations.
PENELOPE: And that's what you...
Sleeping on the bed in the master, the master bedroom.
PENELOPE: Do you get a lot of trouble about how you look when you walk down the street?
Sometimes. Not so much.
What do you do about it?
- Kill them.
- MAN: Pulls out his knife.
Pass on by unless
I'm in a bad mood.
PENELOPE: And if you're in a bad mood, what do you do?
Then I turn around and look at somebody with the expression that Jimmy taught me, which is,
"You're gonna die or you're gonna walk away."
[LAUGHING]
And usually they walk away.
I haven't had to...
PENELOPE: Kill anyone yet...
Do you think your songs look on the dark side of things?
They look on the realistic side of things.
Realism is dark and they're on the dark side of things.
PENELOPE: How long have you been playing?
- Guitar?
- Yeah.
- Ever since I was six.
- Right.
Before that I just played piano and violin and accordion.
PENELOPE: Why do you stand like that on stage?
Like what?
With your legs apart.
I wondered, do you know?
I think because he's so sexy,
I don't know.
- BILLY: I don't.
- I think it's real sexy.
I guess that he's just one of the last...
Maybe his style.
The last people left that are just like have lots of style and lots of like sex appeal and can just... And don't give a shit, you know, about being that way and that's not like...
-[INDISTINCT]
-...punk or anything.
-It's just like this...
4 know, I know.
Everybody's got their style.
That just be Billy's style.
He just stands there and he's cool.
And he doesn't need to do anything else
'cause he's already cool enough.
Is my make up okay?
PENELOPE: Why do you collect those little pamphlets?
Because they're cool.
And because they say...
They're really ridiculous.
They say the most insane things.
And you cannot believe that society's gotten to the state where there are these things you find in the gutter that say,
"The activities of homosexuals and lesbians,
"a detailed expose of the activities
"of these depraved humans would be so revolting that
"it might 'cause a sane person to vomit.
"If you wish the sordid details, consult sexual pathology,
"pathology or sexual pathology
"or the dictionary book for some information.
"Shalom, Israel, the everlasting nation."
But they said that...
- Where does that come from?
- This is so gross.
If you want to find out more, here you can find it.
[HICCUPING] I found that on Hollywood Boulevard...
- Do you have the hiccups?
- Mmm.
And this one's real good,
"What to do to go to hell?"
And you open it up and it's empty.
[LAUGHING]
Did you know that here in this city of LA...
Uh, uh, uh. No.
Wait, there's one thing about public schools.
I think it's on the back of this.
Oh, yeah.
"The product of a public school wanders aimlessly asking,
"'Where did I come from? Why am

"Public education makes leeches and sends people to hell."
[HICCUPS]
[CHUCKLES]
I don't understand this.
Isn't it so weird that people could say that?
"Public education makes leeches."
[HICCUPING]
Anyway, suppose it is true after all. What then?
Yeah. You don't wanna die and you're just this cripple, you're just this idiot and you can't believe that everything's gonna...
BAND MEMBER: Hey, what the fuck is going on in there?
Shut up, you bastard!
[HICCUPING]
PENELOPE: Where did you guys meet?
We met in Venice.
Venice, California.
- EXENE: In a lovely paradise...
- How long ago?
- That's not even possible.
- EXENE: No!
- Three years ago.
- PENELOPE: Yeah.
And you just started doing...
No, there was six months of very bad, bad times.
- Yeah. What was that?
- Between she and me.
Just not getting along and not really...
- PENELOPE: And then you did?
- Yeah.
[SINGING TOGETHER]
Yeah.
We played in our little apartment in Venice where all the winos lived and went to sleep at 8 o'clock.
- Tell 'em about the wine bottle.
- We couldn't wake him up.
Yes, I lived in an apartment in Venice, California where a throat cancer patient had died.
In his refrigerator, he left all his throat cancer medicine, six bottles of beer, and a half empty bottle of red port.
We drank all the beer.
And decided that we were gonna drink the rest of that red port.
And we knew that we were like fucked up.
I mean, we're drinking throat cancer red port, man.
[WHOOPING]
Come on.
-[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
-[IMITATES ENGINE REVVING]
Yeah!
Pick an ear.
- Now, I see one ear.
- Okay.
- One up, one down. Together?
- One down, three up.
- Right ear moving. Left ear.
- Right on.
How did you learn how to do that?
I don't remember.
[CHUCKLES]
PENELOPE: And do you get letters from people in various places other than in Los Angeles?
EXENE: Yes.
JOHN: Yeah, we had a fan club ad in Slash once.
And we got letters from
North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
- Ontario.
-They called from County Jail.
Right, Chuck called us from the County Jail.
I called there once from jail and you weren't home, you asshole.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Why are you on the floor, Exene?
Mmm.
Well, you know why.
'Cause that guy there, the filmer moved our chair and I'm gonna be sitting here.
- No, no I didn't.
- Look the cock knocker moved it.
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
PENELOPE: W m does the FUN stand for'?

All lights are bright.
- One small story about--
- How Jimmy couldn't get a life.
Come on, Johnny.
About when Darby Crash came over and tried to stuff all these little cars in his mouth, I hear Exene scream,
"Don't eat the car.
You'll kill yourself!"
PENELOPE: Are you a happier person now, do you think?
PENELOPE: Are you a happier person now, do you think?
No? Yes?
I don't think of myself as a happy person but I had fun tonight.

[CLAPPING]
JOHN: Exene wrote the line,
“Johnny hit and run Pauline“.
I wrote the song around it.
PENELOPE: Mmm-hmm.
JOHN: Uh, basically a fantasy, wish.
The whole idea of the line, that she was still awake,
is that,
you know, yeah...
there's this rape but it's son of a seduction.
It's every man's, like, dream to be able to be
so potent that they can have sex like that.
- EXENE: John.
- If you could have sex once... lf l can have sex once an hour for 24 hours, I would do it.
[PLAYING JOHNNY HIT
AND RUN PAULENE]
He bought a sterilized hypo
To shoot a sex machine drug
He got twenty four hours
To shoot old Pauline
Between the legs
Ninety six tears
Through twenty four hours
Sex once every hour
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
LA bus doors open
Kicking both doors open
When it rested on 6th Street
That's when he drug a girl inside
He was spreading her legs
And didn't understand dying
She was still awake
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
When he was waking up
Beside the bed
He found clumps of hair
The last, Paulene wouldn't cooperate
She wasn't what you call living really
She was still awake
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Oh!

[WHISTLING AND APPLAUDING]
BOY-
I guess your mama didn't know what hot was until she got up under some lights.
Man.
Ye-ouch!
We're desperate, um...
John wrote that song.
PENELOPE: Yeah!
When he lived in Venice, he wrote it for me to sing.
And it's really weird because at one point! started thinking,
there's gonna come a point
when we keep performing this song.
People are gonna be going,
“Sure they're desperate.“
I just paid six dollars to see this band,
you know, they 're not desperate.
There's worse ways of being desperate than being poor.
PENELOPE: But you don't have money right new?
- And so...
- Well, we're not rich
- We got enough to pay our rent.
- JOHN: We got six dollars.
You know, we bought the ink and the pins.
[JOHN LAUGHING]

JOHN: Hey, woah, hey...
Altamont, all rig ht!
Summer of '68, all right.
Give them a flea bath, quick.
There's a fine line between
There's a fine line between pogo dancing and fighting.
And the fact that if you see somebody you know...
Come up, come here Dutch.
If you see some, somebody over here grabbing a girl and shakin' and shit and throwin' them up against the stage, you know, grabbing her ass or whatever, they are dancing, they're having a good time.
You know, she may be crying, but she may be loving it as weird as these kids can get.
PENELOPE: You think there's gonna be trouble now?
There better not be.
Do I think there's gonna be trouble?
Well, there better not be any trouble.
PENELOPE: Why?
What happens if there is?
Well, where are you gonna put on your next show if there is trouble here?
The bands have to work with the promoters of these shows or it just won't work at all.
And we're only too happy to work with them.
I think I understand what pogo is,
I put on a couple of shows out here and they've come off with no real problems.
PENELOPE: Yeah.
The last show l was out here, you had a cat that had, uh, long, blond hair.
And soon as uh...
Well, he did not understand as you're pointing out.
He did not understand the difference between pogoing and... and real violence.
There is no actual difference, violence is violence.
But, I mean, if they're bashing each other and enjoying it, well, that's up to them.
Um, the only performance that ever makes it and is a success is the performance that causes total madness.
Yeah, I don't really want to be a party to that.
PENELOPE: Dutch, what's the worst problem you ever had?
Uh, one time three guys came up on stage and they were hassling the lead singer for uh...
Exene, I believe it was, from the band X.
And they were trying to rip off her dress or something.
I had to go out and kick them in the face.
-[WALKIE TALKIE CRACKLES]
- PENELOPE: Yeah.
Go ahead, we'll talk in the back.
Go ahead.
MAN: Let's get them in place.
I want to get the doors open.
Okay, on location.

- Thank you.

[CROWD SHOUTING]
MAN: Whoo!
It's like...
When I go to concerts, it's like my friends get beat up by my friends, you know.
Then it's like fucked, you know.
'Cause it's like they're not beating up the rig ht people.
They're not beating up the fucking posers.
They're beating up just, like, just my friends.
It's fucked, you know.
It seems like little crowds, you know, they'll be dancing.
And they'll start punching and then they'll just like, move over to the side, you know, and it'll just go back and forth and back and you can't... you can't dance.
Like, when you see a fight, like, all these people start running over to the fight.
They don't care who it is.
They just start kicking.
You know, going, you know...
PENELOPE: Why do you think they do that?
Just to get aggression out, you know.
'Cause they're fucked.
I don't know.
That's why I do it.
Just to get aggression out.
All this fucking pent up shit.
And, uh...
They cut their hair and you know, they dye it.
Then they come up there and you know...
A lot of them cause problems.
You know, you see the young kids with their head shaved and they really get belligerent.
Short hair, you just see Am...
The clean-cut American look.
Man, it's just cool.
Yeah.
I put a guy in the hospital you know, a little while back.
PENELOPE: What happened?
Uh, broke his nose and his jaw.
I cut up his face.
They said I hit him with a chain.
I guess I did.
Just a little bit drunk.
Didn't remember.
What's the pent up aggression?
Where does that come from?
Well, with me, it just comes from like, living in the city and just seeing everything, seeing all the ugly old people and just the fucking...
The buses and just the din.
That, you know, it just...
That's what I see all the time.
So, just all the time you're fucking bummed.
You're just thinking about that, so when I go there, I just... sometimes I get out some aggression.
Maybe by beating up some asshole, you know.
There's a lot of violence in the music. There should be.
PENELOPE: Why are they so angry?
Um, they don't know.
I don't know.
You know, they think that's what punk rock is, violence.
A lot of people are afraid of me.
But that's just like, they go by appearance.
Guess I'm a scary looking person.
I've probably punched out everybody I know one time or the other, but I've always ran afterwards.
'Cause I'm...
I can't fight.
I like making a spectacle of myself.
I'm a total rebel.
I rebel against everything.
I guess I'm an alcoholic.
[CHUCKLES]
I just hang by myself mostly, you know.
Why?
Well, fuck, I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm just like that.
You know, I just like being by myself.
The police are all calling me names and they made me take a shower
'cause they said I smell.
They asked me why I don't wash my clothes more often.
I swear to God,
I hate cops to the max.
Sometime, when niggers come up to me, they're like, you know...
They'll wanna...
They'll go, "Hey!"
And then they'll start chasing me, like...
You know most times I ran.
Yeah, in LA I get chased a lot.
You know.
But it doesn't really mean I...
You know, I'm sure
I'm gonna go kill a Jew.
You know, I'm not gonna do that.
Maybe a hippie, though.
I mean, you know, the punks...
You know, punks against hippies, that's another thing if the hippies are starting it.
But then again, punks against punks, you know, that's not... that's not what it's meant to be.
In Hollywood, most of the people are like posers.
They're just wimpy, you know.
PENELOPE: When you fight, how do you feel?
When you're actually in a fight?
How do you feel?
Violent.
Yeah?
I feel very violent.
I feel like I'm doing something
I'm good at.
What?
Beating people up.
[LAUGHTER]
And everyone shouldn't be afraid to be as different as they want to be.
People hold back a lot.
I've probably hit lots of girls in the face.
I don't like girls very much.
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.
- How come?
- Don't have girlfriends.
Why?
Girls are terrible.
Now, I'm very good at hiding my feelings so I, I don't feel depression anymore.
It's easy for me not to do that.
I... It's easy to be very detached.
My mother's dead, so...
My step-dad, he's a cop.
You know, I haven't talked to him in a long time.
Seen him at the movies one night.
He didn't talk to me.
He walked away.
Acted like he didn't know me.
I don't know where my parents are.
- Where's your real father?
-Don't know.
Don't even know who he is.
Society stinks.
We were trying to change something.
The music industry, the way we live.
You know, to be accepted the way we want to, you know...
Why do you wear those clothes like that?
I'm comfortable.
At one time, maybe,
I was considered different, but now, I'm in a comfortable lifestyle and I can be myself.
Everyone's hair should be blue because that's the best color.
It looks... it looks so good.
I figure, when I get tired living the life I am now, think I'll go into classical music.
Is the time up now?
PENELOPE: Show me your head.
Why did you do that?
I'm an X-head.
Fuck!
[PLAYING PROWLERS IN THE NIGHT]
[PLAYING PROWLERS IN THE NIGHT]
People are longing
They keep disappearing
Their secrets are turning
Thinner than air
Watching your basket
Knowing it's stupid
You lift up the box lid
To see what you can
Prowlers in the night
Ready for the kiss-off
Than the fight
There is a light on of hidden reaction
The words mean to say
Kiss or fist
No easy answers
To unsolved questions
A string of opportunities missed
Prowlers in the night
Ready for the kiss-off
Than the fight
Laugh if you're able
They all die slow
Suicide reasons are stupid excuses
Everyone's saying there's nowhere to go
Prowlers in the night
Ready for the kiss-off
Than the fight
[P LAYING GLUTTONY]
A nice pot roast just dropped in
Dressed in clogs, your yummy friend
Watch the hunger pangs set in,
Watch the calories go marching in
ifs more mass gluttony
Add those pounds to hide the tears
Nights rise, dough boys crumble
But the need consumes us all
Munch and feed to heart's desire
Heartburn can only set us free
From gluttony, gluttony, gluttony
Wallow in your cow disease
Pay no mind to the salivating brood
Find your comfort in your food
[CROWD CHEERING]
PENELOPE: Wayne, can you tell me what you thought the first time you saw them dancing?
Well, to me, it was just another form of dance.
It didn't really surprise me because I've been a... a dance fan myself for many years and
I've probably tried most types of dancing.
But, the pogo dance is just exactly what the name implies, is people gyrating up and down in a vertical position as though they were in fact riding a pogo stick.
[LAUGHING]
But I can't say that
I was really surprised by it.
Well, I was.
I never saw anything like that in my life.
I thought they were starting something.
I don't know.
I just... It scared me.
PENELOPE: Why do you think they act like that?
It's an energy outlet.
It's...
They're really nice kids.
They just have to be doing something different.
PENELOPE: Yeah.
It's a release from their daily tensions, I guess.
- What ever that may mean.
- In our day we ate goldfish.
[LAUGHING]
Right.
LEE: I want all you assholes that are standing back there sucking that overpriced shit come up here, closer.
They wouldn't let us play here tonight they thought on account that we didn't play here a long time and they said the last time we played here there was a riot.
So, you're not going to disappoint us, are you?
Let's see a little motion up here.
This ain't no fucking country club.

Interesting. - It is interesting.

- It's cos I'm watching you, you see. I'm learning from you.
Do you like the lines around the lips?
No, I don't like and she knows that.
But I like the idea of the blue lines with the pink lipstick. That's quite good.
- You see how they pick on me and make me feel terrible?
- You're a girl. What do you know about make-up?
Exactly! That's what I say all the time(!)
Make-up for a night out on the town, with the boys.

Iceland is a stable democracy with the high standard of living... and until recently... extremely low unemployment and government debt.
We had the complete infrastructure of a modern society: clean energy, food production, fisheries with a quota system to manage them.
Good healthcare and good education, clean air, not much crime,
It's good place for families to life...
We had almost "end of history" status.
But in 2000 Iceland government began a broad policy of deregulation... that would have disastrous consequences... first for the environment and then for the economy...
They started by allowing... multinational corporations like Alcova... to build giant aluminum smelting plants... and exploit Iceland’s natural geothermal... and hydroelectric energy sources.
Many of the most beautiful areas in the highlands... with the most spectacular colors are geothermal.
So nothing comes without consequences.
At the same time the government privatized...
Iceland’s three largest banks...
The result was one of the purest experiments in financial deregulation... ever conducted.
Finance took over and uh, more or less wrecked the place.
In a 5 year period this three tiny banks... which have never operated outside of Iceland... borrowed 120 billion dollars... ten time the size of Iceland’s economy.
The bankers showered money on themselves... each other and their friends.
There was a massive bubble...
Stock prices went up by a factor of nine, house prices more than doubled...
Iceland bubble gave rise to people... like Jon Asgeir Johannesson.
He borrowed billions from the banks... to buy up high-end retail businesses in London.
He also bought a pinstriped private jet, a 40 million dollar yacht... and a Manhattan penthouse.
Newspapers always had headlines: this millionaire bought this company... in UK or in Finland or in France or wherever.
Instead of saying... this millionaire took a billion dollars loan... to buy this company... and it took it from your local bank.
The banks set up money market funds... and the banks advised deposit-holders to... withdraw money and put them in a money market funds.
The Ponzi scheme needed everything it could, huh?
American accounted firms like KPMG... audit the Iceland’s banks and investment firms... and found nothing wrong.
And American credit rating agencies... said Iceland was wonderful.
In February 2007... the rating agencies decided... to upgrade the banks... to a highest possible rate – AAA.
It went so far as the government here... traveling with the bankers as a PR show.
When Iceland’s banks collapsed at the end of 2008... unemployment tripled in 6 months.
There is nobody unaffected in Iceland.
- So a lotta people here lost their savings.
- Yes that’s the case.
The government regulators... who should’ve been protecting the citizens of Iceland... had done nothing.
You have two lawyers... from regulator company who're coming to a bank... to talk about some issues.
When they approach the bank... they would see nineteen SUV's outside the bank... so you went to the bank and you have... nineteen lawyers sitting in front of you... that very well prepared, ready to kill any argument you make... and then if you do very well... they offer you job.
One third of Iceland’s financial regulators... went to work for the banks.
But this is universal problem, in New York you have the same problem, right?
What do you think of Wall Street incomes this days?
Excessive.
I've been told that it's extremly difficult... for the IMF to critisize United States.
I wouldn't say that.
We deeply regret our breaches of US law.
They’re amazed at... how much cocain these Wall Streeters can use... and get up and go to work the next day.
I didn't know what credit default swaps are.
I'm little bit old fashioned.
Has Larry Summers ever expressed remorse?
I don't hear confessiones.
The government just writing checks... that's plan A, that's plan B and that's plan C.
Would you support legal controls on executive pay?
I would not.
Are you comfortable with... law of compensation in financial service industry?
If they waranted, then yes, I am.
- Do you think they waranted?
- I think they waranted.
And so you help this people blow the world up?
You could say that.
They were having massive private gains at public loss.
When you start thinking... you can create something out of nothing... it's very difficult to resist.
I'm concerned that a lot of people... want go back to the old way... the way they were operating prior to the crisis.
I was getting a lot of anonymus e-mails from bankers... saying "You can't quote me, but I'm really concerned".
Why do you think there isn't... a more systematic investigation being undertaking?
Because then you will find the culprits.
Do you think that Columbia Business School... has any significant conflict of interest problem?
Don't see that we do.
The regulators didn't do their job... they had the power to do every case that I made when I was state attorney general... they just didn't want it.
Over the weekend, Lehman Brothers one of the most venerable... and biggest investment banks, was forced to declare itself bankrupt... another, Merrill Lynch, was forced to sell itself today.
- Crisis talks are underway...
- World financial markets... are way down today... dramatic developments for two Wall Street giants...
In september 2008... the bankruptcy of US investment bank
Lehman Brothers... and the collapse of the world... largest insurance company AIG... triggered the global financial crisis... fears gripped markets overnight... with Asian stocks slammed by...
Stocks fell off a cliff... the largest single point drop in history.
Share prices continued to tumble in... the aftermath of the Lehman collapse.
The result was the global recession... which costs the world tens of trillions of dollars... rendered 30 millions people unemployed... and doubled the national debt of the US.
If you looked at the costs of it: the structure of equity welth, of housing wealth... then the structure of income, of jobs,
15 million people globally... could end up below the poverty line again.
This is just a hugely, hugely expensive crisis.
This crisis was not an accident.
It was caused by an out of control industry.
Since the 1980s the rise of US financial sector... has led to a series... of increasingly severe financial crises.
Each crisis has caused more damage... while the industry has made more and more money.
Part I. How we got here
After the Great Depression
United States... have 40 years of economic growth... without a single financial crisis... the financial industry was tightly regulated... most regular banks were local businesses... and they were prohibited from speculating... with depositors savings.
Investment banks... which handle stock and bond tradings... were small private partnerships.
In the traditional investment banking... partnership model... the partners put the money up... and obviously the partners... watch that money very carefully.
They wanted to live well... but they didn't want to... bet the ranch on anything.
Paul Volcker served on the treasury department... and was chairman of the Federal Reserve... from 1979... 1987.
Before going into government, he was a financial economist... at Chase Manhattan Bank.
When I left Chase to go in Treasury in 1969...
I think my income was in the neighbour...
- of 45,000 dollars per year.
- 45,000 dollars a year?
Morgan Stanley in 1972... had approximately
110 total personnel.
One office and capital of $12,000,000
Now Morgan Stanley has
50,000 workers... and has capital of several billion... and has offices all over the world.
In the 1980's the financial industry exploded.
The investment banks went public... given them huge amount of stock holding money.
People on Wall Street started getting rich.
I had a friend who was a bond trader... at Merilyn Lynch in 1970s.
He had a job as a train conducter at night.
Because he had 3 kids... and couldn't support them... on what a bond trader made.
By 1986 he was making millions of dollars... and thought it was because he was smart.
The highest order of business before the nation... is to restore our economic prosperity.
In 1981 president Ronald Reagan... choses Treasury Secretary... the CEO of investment bank
Merrill Lynch...
Donald Regan.
Wall Street and the President do see eye to eye.
I've talked to many leaders of Wall Street... they also will be behind the President on 100%.
The Reagan administration... supported by economists and financial lobbyist... started the 30 years period of financial deregulations.
In 1982 the Reagan administration... deregulated savings and loan companies... allowing them to make risky investments... with their depositors' money.
By the end of the decade... hundreds of saving and loan compnies had failed.
This crises cost tax payers
124 billion dollars... and cost many people their live savings.
It may be the biggest bank heist in our history.
Thousands of saving and loan executives... went to jail for looting their companies.
One of the most extreme cases... was Charles Keating.
In 1985 when federal regulators... began investigating him...
Keating hired an economist... named Alan Greenspan.
In this letter to regulators...
Greenspan praised Keating's... sound business plan and expertise... and said he saw no risk in allowing...
Keating to invest his customers money.
Keating reportedly paid Greenspan
40,000 dollars.
Charles Keating went to prison shortly afterwords.
As for Alan Greenspan...
President Reagan appointed him... chairman of America's central bank...
The Federal Reserve.
Greenspan was reappointed... by presidents Clinton and George W. Bush.
During the Clinton administration... deregulation continued under Greenspan.
And Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the former CEO of the investment bank...
Goldman Sachs... and Larry Summers,
Harvard economics professor...
The financial sector of Wall Street being powerfull, having lobbyist, having lots of money... step by step captured the political system... both on the Democratic and the Republican side.
By the late 1990s... the financial sector had consolidated... into few gigantic firms.
Each of them so large... that their failure can threaten whole system
And the Clinton administration... helped them grow even larger.
In 1999 Citicorp and Travelers... merged to form Citigroup... the largest financial services company... in the world.
The merger violated the Glass-Steagal act... a law passed after Great Depression... which prevented banks with costumer deposits... from engaging in risky investment banking activities.
It was illegal to acquire Travelers.
Greenspan said nothing.
The Federal Reserve gave him exemption... for a year and then they got the law passed.
In 1999 at the urging of Summers and Rubin...
Congress passed the "Glemm-Leach-Bliley Act"
Known to some as the Citigroup Relive Act.
It overturned "Glass-Steagal"... and clear the way for future mergers...
Why do you have big banks... because banks like monopoly power... because banks like lobbying power, because banks know that when you too big... they will be bailed.
Markets are inherently unstable... or at least potentially unstable... and appropriate metaphor is the old tankers... they very big and therefore... you have to put in compartments... to prevent the sloshing around of oil... from capsizing the boat... the design of the boat has to take it into account... and after the Depression... the regulation actually introduced... this very watertight compartments... and deregulation has led to... the end of compartmentalisation.
The next crisis came at the end of the 90's.
The investment banks fuel the mass of the bubble in internet stocks
Which were followed by a crash in 2001... that caused 5 trillion dollars in investment losses.
The Securities and Exchange Commission... the federal agency which had been created... during the depression to regulate investment banking... had done nothing.
In the absence of meaning for federal action... and there has been none... and given the clear failure of self regulation.
It is become necessary for others to step in... and adopt the protections needed.
Eliot Spitzers investigation revealed that... the investments banks had promoted... internet companies they knew would fail.
Stock analysts were being paid... based on how much business they brought in... and what they sad publicly... was quite different from what they sad privately.
Infospace given the highest possible rating... dismissed by the analysts as the "piece of junk".
Excite... also highly rated... called "such a piece of crap".
The defence that was proffered... by many of the investment banks... was not, you're wrong, it was...
Everybodie's doing it and everybodie knew what's going on... and therefore nobody should rely on this analysts anyway.
In december 2002 ten investment banks... settle the case for a total of 1.4 billion dollars... and promised to change their ways.
Scott Talbott is the chief lobbyist... for the Financial Services Roundtable... one of the most powerfull groups in Washington... which represents nearly all of... the world largest financial companies.
Are you comfortable with the fact... that several of your member companies... have engaged in large scale criminal activity?
- You'll have to be specific
- Okay...
And first of all criminal activity... shouldn't be accepted, period.
Since deregulation began... the world's biggest financial firms... have been caught laundering money, defrauding customers and cooking thier books... again, and again, and again.
Credit Suisse helped funnel money... for Iran's nuclear program... and for the Aerospace Industries
Organization of Iran... which built ballistic missiles.
Any information that would identify it... as Iranian would be removed.
The bank was fined
536 million dollars.
Citibank helped funnel
1.5 million dollars... of drug money out of Mexico.
Did you comment that she should...
"loose any documents connected with the account".
I said that in a kidding manner... it was at the early stages of this.
I did not mean it seriously.
Between 1998 and 2003
Fannie Mae overstated its earnings... by more than 10 billion dollars.
This accounted standarts are highly complex... and required determinations... over which experts often disagree.
CEO Franklin Raines... who used to be
President Clinton's budget director... recieved over 52 million dollars in bonuses.
When UBS was caught... helping wealthy americans evade taxes... they refused to cooperate with US goverment.
Would you be willing to supply the names?
If there is a treaty framework...
No treaty framework, you've agreed you participated in a fraud.
Hm...
But while the company is faced an unprecedented fines... the investment firms do not... have to admit any wrong doing.
When you this large and you are dealing... with this many products and this many customers... mistakes happen.
The financial services industry... seems to have level of criminality that is, you know, somewhat distinctive.
When was the last time when...
CISCO or Intel or Google or Apple or IBM you know...
I'm totaly agree with you... about hightech versus financial services... but hightech is fundamentally creative business... where value generation and income derives... when you actually create something new and different.
Begining at 1990's... deregulations and advances in technology... led to an explosion of complex financial products... called derivatives.
Economists and bankers... claimed they made market safer.
But instead they made it unstable.
Since the end of Cold War... a lot of former physicist and mathematicians... decided to apply their skills... not on Cold War technology... but on financial markets.
And together with investment bankers and hedge funds...
- Create a different weapons?
- Absolutely.
As Warren Buffett said:
"Weapons of mass destruction".
Regulators, politicians and business people... did not take seriously... the threat of financial innovation... on the stability of the financial system.
Using derivatives bankers... could gamble on virtually anything.
They could bet on rise or fall of oil prises... the bankruptcy of the company, even the whether.
By the late 1990s derivatives... were a 15 trillion dollar unregulated market.
In 1998 someone tried to regulate them.
Brooksley Born graduated first in her class in Stanford Law School... and was the first woman... to edit the major law review.
After running derivatives practice at Arnold & Porter...
Born was appointed by president Clinton... to chair the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission... which oversaw the derivatives' market
Brooksley Born ask me if...
I would come work with her.
We decided that this was a serious, potentially destabilizing market.
In may of 1998 the CFTC... issued a proposal to regulate derivatives
Clinton Treasury department had an immediate response
I happened to go into Brooksley's office... and she was just putting down the reciever of her telephone... and the blood had drained from her face.
And she looked at me and said:
"That was Larry Summers.
He had 13 bankers in his office"
He conveyed it in a very bullying fashion
Sort of directing her to stop.
The banks were now heavily reliant... for earnings on this types of activities... and that led to titanic battle... to prevent this set of instruments from been regulated.
Shortly after the phone call from Summers
Greenspan, Rubin and SEC chairman Arthur Levitt... issued a joint statement condemning Born... and recomended legislation... to keep derivatives unregulated.
Regulations of derivatives transactions... that are privately negotiated by professionals... is unnecessary.
She was overruled, unfortunately... first by the Clinton administration... and then by the Congress... in 2000 Senator Phil Gramm took a major role... and getting a bill passed... that pretty much exempted derivatives from regulation.
They are unifying markets they are reducing regulatory burden.
I believe that we need to do it.
After leaving the Senate, Phill Gramm became Vice-Chairman of UBS.
Since 1993, his wife Wendy had served on the board of Enron.
But its our very great hope... that it would be possible to move this year on legislation in a suitable way... goes to create legal certainty for OTC derivatives.
I wished to assosiate myself with all of... the remarks of secretary Summers.
In december 2000
Congress passed...
The Commodity Futures Modernization Act.
Written with a help of financial industry lobbyists... it banned the regulation of derivatives.
Once that's was done it was off to the races.
And use of derivatives and financial innovation... exploded dramatically after 2000.
- So help me God.
- So help me God.
By the time George W. Bush took office in 2001... the US financial sector was vastly more profitable, concentrated and powerfull then ever before.
Dominating this industry were five investment banks, two financial conglomerates, three securities insurance companies... and three rating agencies.
And linking them all together... was a securitization food chain, a new system... which connected trillion of dollars, mortgages and other loans... with investors all over the world.
30 years ago if you wanted get a loan for a home... the person lending you a money... expecting you to pay him or her back... you got a loan from a lender who wanted you to pay him back... we've since developed securitization thereby... people who made the loan... are no loger at risk of failure to repay.
In old system when home owner... paid their mortgage every months... the money went to their local lender.
And since mortgages took decades to repay... lenders were carefull.
In a new system lenders sold the mortgages to investment banks.
The investment banks combined thousands of mortgages and other loans... including car loans, student loans and credit card debt... to create complex derivatives... called collateralized debt obligation, or CDO... the investment banks then sold the CDO's to investors.
Now when home owners paid their mortgages... the money went to investors all over the world.
The investment banks paid rating agencies to evaluate the CDO's... and many of them were given a AAA rating... which is highest possible investment rate.
This made CDO's popular with retirement funds... which can only purchase highly rated securities.
This system was a ticking time bomb.
Lenders didn't care anymore about whether a borrower can repay.
So they started making riskier loans.
The investment banks didn't care either.
The more CDO's they sold the higher their profits... and the rating agencies which were paid by the investment banks... had no liability if their ratings of CDO's proved wrong.
You were getting to be on the hook... and there weren't regulationly constraints... so there were a green light to just pump out more and more loans.
Bentween 2000 and 2003... the number of mortgage loans made each year... nearly quadrupled.
Everybody in this securitization food chain... from the very beginning until the end... didn't care about quality of the mortgage... they caring about maximazing their volume... and getting a fee out of it.
In the early 2000's there was a huge increase... in the riskiest loans called subprime... but when thousands of subprime loans... were combined to create CDO's.
Many of them still received AAA ratings
Now it wouldn't have been possible to create derivative products... that don't have this risks... that carry the equivalent of deductibles... where there are limits on risks... that can be taken on and so forth... they didn't do that, did they.
They didn't do that and in retrospect they should have done.
So these guys knew they were doing something dangerous?
I think they did.
All incentives that the financial institutions... offered to the mortgage brokers... were based on sawing the most profitable... products which were predatory loans.
The bankers makes more money if they put you on subprime loan.
That's what they gonna put you
Suddenly hundreds of billions of dollars a year... were flowing through securitization chain.
Since anyone can get a mortgage... home purchases and house's prises skyrocketed.
The result was the biggest financial bubble in history.
Real estate is real, they can see their asset... their can live in their asset, they can rent out their asset.
You had huge boom in housing that had no sense at all... financing appetites out of financial sector... droved what everyboby else did.
Last time we had a housing bubble was in the late 80's.
In that case the increasing home praises were relatively minor.
That housing bubble led to relatively severe recession.
From 1996 until 2006 real home prices effectively doubled.
At 500 dollar a ticket... they come to hear how to buy... their very own piece of the American dream.
Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch... were all in on this, the subprime lending alone... increase from 30 billion a year in funding... to over six hundred billion a year in ten years... they new what was happening.
Countrywide Financial the largest subprime lender... issued 97 billion dollars worth of loans.
It made over 11 million dollars in profits as a result.
On Wall Street annual cash bonuses spiked... traders and CEO's became enormously wealthy during the bubble.
Lehman Brothers was the top uderwriter of subprime lending.
And their CEO Richard Fuld took home
485 million dollars.
On Wall Street this housing and credit bubble... was leading to hundreds of billions of dollars of profits.
By 2006 about 40% of all profits of S&P 500 firms... was coming from financial institutions.
It wasn't real profits, it wasn't real income.
It was just money that was being... created by the system and booked as income... to 3 years down the road this a default it's all wiped out.
I think it was in fact, in retrospect, a great big national, and not just national global ponzi scheme.
Through the home ownership and equality protection act... the Federal Reserve Board had brought authority... to regulate mortgage industry... but Federal Chairman Alan Greenspan refuse to use it.
Alan Greenspan said no that regulation:
"I don't even believe in it".
For 20 years Robert Gnaizda was the head of Greenlining... a powerfull consumer advocacy group.
He met with Greenspan on a regular basis.
We gave him an example of Countrywide...
150 different complex adjustable rate mortgages.
He said if you'd had a doctorate in math... you wouldn't be able to understand them enough... to know which was good for you and which wasn't.
So we thought he was gonna take action... but as the conversation continues... it was clear he was stuck with his ideology.
We met again with Greenspan at '05... often we met with him twice a year never less than once a year... and he wouldn't change his mind.
Alan Greenspan declined to be interviewed for this film.
In this amazing world of instant global communications.
The free and efficient movement of capital... is helping to create the greatest prosperity in human history.
146 people were cut from the enforcement division of SEC... is that what you also testified to.
Yeah, I think there has been a, a systematic... gutting, or whatever you want to call it, of the agency and its capability, through cutting back of staff.
The SEC office of risk managment... was reduce to a staff, did you say, of one?
Yeah, when that gentelman would go home at night he could turn the lights out.
During the bubble the investment banks were borrowing heavily... to buy more loans and create more CDO's.
The ratio between borrowed money and... bank's own money was called leverage.
The more banks borrowed the higher their leverage.
In 2004 Henry Paulson the CEO of Goldman Sachs... helped lobby the
Securities and Exchange Commission... to relax limits on leverage... allowing the banks to sharply increase their borrowing.
The SEC somehow decided to let... investment banks gamble a lot more.
That was nuts I don't know why they did that but they did that.
We've said these are the big guys and clearly that's true.
But that means if anything goes wrong, it's going to be an awfully big mess.
At this levels you're obviously dealing with... the most highly sofisticated financial institutions.
These are the firms that do most of the derivative activity in the United States.
We talked to some of them as to what their comfort level was.
The firms actually thought that the number was appropriate.
Do the commissioners vote to adopt the rule amendments and new rules... as recommended by the staff?
We do indeed. Unanimous.
And we are adjourned.
The degree of leverage in financial systemas... became absolutely frightening... investment banks leveraging up to the level 33 to 1... which means that tiny 3% decrease in a value of asset base... would leave them insolvent.
There was another ticking time bomb in the financial system.
AIG, the worlds largest insurence company... was selling huge quantities of derivatives called credit default swaps.
For investers who owned CDO's... credit default swaps worked like an insurance policy.
An investor who purchase credit default swap paid AIG a guatrerly premium.
If CDO went bad, AIG promised to pay to investor for their losses.
But unlike regularly insurance speculators could also buy credit default swaps from AIG in order to bet against CDO's they didn't own.
In insurence you could only insure something you own.
Let's say you and I own property and I own a house...
I can only insure that house once... the derivatives universe essentially enables anybody to actually insure that house.
So you could insure that somebody else could do that so 50 people could insure my house.
So what happens is if my house burns down... the number of losses in the system becomes proportionally large.
Since credit default swaps were unregulated...
AIG didn't have put aside any money to cover potential losses.
Instead AIG paid its employees huge cash bonuses... as soon as contract was signed... but if a CDO's later went bad
AIG would be on the hook.
People were essentially been rewarded for taking massive risks. In good times... they generate short-term revenues and profits and therefore bonuses... but that's gonna lead to the firm to be bankrupt over time... that's totally distorted system of compensation.
AIG Financial Products division in Lonodon... issued 500 billion dollars worth of credit default swaps during the bubble.
Many of them for CDO's backed by subprime mortgages.
The AIG FP made 3.5 billion dollars between 2000 and 2007.
Joseph Cassano, the head of AIG FP, personally made 315 million dollars.
It's hard for us, without being flippant, to even... to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason... that would see us losing 1 dollar in any of those transactions.
In 2007 AIG auditors raised warnings.
One of them Joseph St. Denis resigned in protest.
After Cassano repeatedly blocked him from investigating AIG FP's accounting.
Let me tell you one person... who didn't get a bonus when everybody else was getting bonuses.
That was Sant Denis.
Mr. St. Denis who tried to alert the two of you... to the fact that you are running into big problems... he quit in frustration and he didn't get a bonus.
In 2005, Raghuram Rajan... then the Chief economist of the
International Monetary Fund... delivered a paper at the
Annual Jackson Hole symposium... the most elite banking conference in the world.
Who was in the audience?
It was, uh... I guess the central bankers of the world... uh... ranging from Mr. Greenspan himself,
Ben Bernanke,
Larry Summers was there,
Tim Geithner was there.
The title of the paper was essentially:
Is Financial Development
Making the World Riskier?
And the conclusion was, uh... it is.
Rajan's paper focused on incentives structures... that generated huge cash bonuses... based on short-term profits... but which imposed no penalties for later losses.
Rajan argued that these incentives encouraged bankers to take risks... that might eventually destroy their own firms... or even the entire financial system.
It's very easy to generate perfomance by taking on more risk.
And so what you need to do is compensate for risk-adjusted performance... and that's where all the bodies are buried.
Rajan hit the nail on the head.
What he particularly said was:
"You guys have claimed you found a way to make more profit with less risk,
I say you found a way to make more profit with more risk"... and that's a big difference.
Summers was vocal
He basically thought that I was criticizing the change in the financial world.
And was worried about regulation which reverse this whole change.
So essentially he accused me of being a Luddite.
He wanted to make sure that we didn't bring a whole new set of regulations... to constrain the financial sector at that point.
Larry Summers declined to be interviewed for this film.
You gonna make an extra 2 million dollars a year or 10 million dollars a year.
For putting your financial institution at risk.
Someone else pays the bill, you don't pay the bill.
Would you make that bet?
Most people who worked on Wall Street said: "Sure, I make that bet".
The Hamptons
2 hours from New York City...
That's never was enough.
They don't wanna own one home.
They wanna own 5 homes and they wanna have an expensive Penthouse on Park Avenue.
And they wanna have their own private jet.
You think this is an industry were high, very high compensation levels is just fine?
I think I would take caution, take heed, or take exception at your word very high,
I mean it's all relative.
You have a 14 million dollar oceanfront home in Florida, you have a summer vacation home in Sun Valley, Idaho... you and your wife have art collection filled with million dollar paintings.
Richard Fuld never appeared on the trading floor.
There was art advisors up there all the time.
You know, he had his own private elevator, he were out of his way to be disconnected
I mean, his elevator, the hire technicians to program it, you know, so that his driver would call in in the morning, and... a security guard would hold it. and there'a only like 2 or 3 seconds window when he actually he has to see people... and he hops in the elevator and he goes straight to 31.
Lehman owned a bunch of corporate jets, do you know about this?
Yes.
How many were there?
Well, there were 6, including 767's.
- They also had a helicopter.
- I see.
Isn't that kind a lot of planes to have?
We deal with type A personalities and, uh... type A personalities know everything in the world.
Banking became a pissing contest, you know mine is bigger than yours, that's kind of stuff.
It was all men that ran it, incidentally.
15 billion dollar deals weren't large enough so we do 100 billion dollar deals.
These people are risk-takers, they're impulsive.
Jonathan Alpert is a therapist whose clients include high-level Wall Street executive...
That's part of their behavior it's part of their personality... and that manifests outside of work as well.
It's quite typical for the guys to go out, to go strip bars, to use drugs. I see a lot of cocain use, a lot of use of prostitution.
Recently neuroscientists have done experiments... where, uh... they've taken individuals, put them into MRI machine... and they have them play a game where the prize is money.
And they notice that when the subjects earn money... the part of the brain that get stimulated is the same part that cocain stimulates.
A lot of people feel they need to really participate in that behavior... to make it to get promoted, to get recognized.
According to a Bloomberg article... business entertainment represents 5% of revenue... for New York derivatives brokers... and often includes strip clubs, prostitution, and drugs.
A New York broker filed a lawsuit in 2007 against his firm... alleging he was required to retain prostitutes to entertain traders.
There's just a blatant disregard... for the impact that their actions might have on, on society, or on family.
They have no problem using a prostitute, uh... and going home to their wife.
Kristin Davis ran an elite prostitution ring from her high-rise apartment.
It was located a few blocks from the new york stock exchange.
How many customers?
About 10,000 at that point in time.
What fraction were from Wall Street?
Of the higher-end clients, probably
40 to 50 percent.
And were all the major Wall Street firms represented? Goldman Sachs.
Lehman Brothers, yeah, they’re all in there.
Morgan Stanley was a little less of that... uh... I think Goldman was, was pretty, pretty big with that.
A lot of clients would call me, and say, can you get me a Lamborghini... for the night for the girl?
These guys were spending corporate money.
I had many black cards from, you know, the various financial firms.
What's happening is services are being charged to computer repair.
Trading research, you know, consulting for market compliance.
I just usually gave them a piece of letterhead, and said, make your own invoice.
So this pattern of behavior, you think, extends... to the senior management of the firm.
Absolutely does, yeah.
I know for a fact that it does.
It extends to the very top.
A friend of mine, who, who's involved in a company that has a big financial presence, said: Well, it's about time you learned about subprime mortgages.
So he set up a session with his trading desk and me... and, and a techie, who, who did all this... gets very excited... runs to his computer, pulls up, in about three seconds, this Goldman Sachs issue of securities.
It was a complete disaster.
Borrowers had borrowed, on average,
99.3 percent of the price of the house.
Which means they have no money in the house.
If anything goes wrong, they're gonna walk away from the mortgage.
This is not a loan you'd really make, right?
You've gotta be crazy.
But somehow, you took 8,000 of these loans... and by the time the guys were done at
Goldman Sachs and the rating agencies, two-thirds of the loans were rated AAA, which meant they were rated as safe as government securities.
It's, it's utterly mad.
Goldman Sachs sold at least
3.1 billion dollars worth... of these toxic CDO's in the first half of 2006.
The CEO of Goldman Sachs at this time was Henry Paulson, the highest-paid CEO on Wall Street.
Good morning, welcome to the White House.
I am pleased to announce that I will nominate Henry Paulson... to be the secretary of the Treasury.
He has a lifetime of business experience, he has an intimate knowledge of financial markets... he has earned a reputation for candor and integrity.
You might think it would be hard for Paulson... to adjust to a meager government salary.
But taking the job as Treasury secretary was the best financial decision of his life.
Paulson had to sell his
485 million dollars of Goldman stock... when he went to work for the government.
But because of a law passed by the first President Bush, he didn't have to pay any taxes on it.
It saved him 50 million dollars.
The article came out in October of 2007.
Already, a third of the mortgages defaulted.
Now, uh, most of them are goin'.
One group that had purchased these now-worthless securities... was the Public Employees
Retirement System of Mississippi, which provides monthly benefits to over 80,000 retirees.
They lost millions of dollars, and are now suing Goldman Sachs.
By late 2006, Goldman had taken things a step further.
It didn't just sell toxic CDO's... it started actively betting against them at the same time it was telling customers... that they were high-quality investments.
By purchasing credit default swaps from AIG,
Goldman could bet against CDO's it didn't own, and get paid when the CDOs failed.
I asked them if anybody called the customers, and said, you know, we don't really like this kind of mortgage anymore, and we thought you ought to know, you know.
They, they didn't really say anything... but, you know, you could just feel the laughter coming over the phone.
Goldman Sachs bought at least 22 billion dollars of credit default swaps from AIG.
It was so much that Goldman realized that AIG itself might go bankrupt... so they spent 150 million dollars... insuring themselves against
AIG's potential collapse.
Then, in 2007, Goldman went even further.
They started selling CDO's specifically designed... so that the more money their customers lost, the more money Goldman Sachs made.
Six hundred million dollars,
Timberwolf Securities is what you sold.
Before you sold them, this is what your sales team were tellin' to each other.
Boy, that Timberwolf was one shitty deal.
This was an e-mail to me in late June.
- Right. And you're callin' Timberwol
- After the transaction.
No, no, you sold Timberwolf after as well.
W... we did trades after that.
Yeah, okay.
The next e-mail, take a look,
July 1, '07... tells the sales force,
"the top priority is Timberwolf".
Your top priority to sell is that shitty deal. if you have an adverse interest to your client, do you have the duty to disclose that to your client... to tell that client of your adverse interest? That's my question.
Mr. Chairman, just tryin' to understand...
No, I think you understand it
I don't think you want to answer it.
Do you believe that you have a duty to act... in the best interests of your clients?
Again, uh... uh... Senator, I,
I will repeat, you know, we have a, a duty to, to serve our clients... by showing prices on transaction where they ask us to show prices for.
What do you think about... selling securities which your own people think are... crap?
Does that bother you?
I think they would, again, as a hypothetical?
No. This is real
- Well then I don't...
- We heard it today.
- Well...
- We heard it today: this is a shitty deal, this is crap.
I... I... I heard nothing today that makes me think anything, um... went wrong
Is there not a conflict when you sell something to somebody, and then are determined to bet against that same security... and you don't disclose that to the person you're selling it.
- In the...
- Do you see a problem?
In the context of market-making, that is not a conflict.
When you heard that your employees, in these e-mails, said,
"god, what a shitty deal, god, what a piece of crap"... do you feel anything?
If... I think that's very unfortunate to have on e-mail.
Are you b...
And, and, and very unfortunate...
I don't, I don't...
On e-mail?
How about feeling that way?
I think it's very unfortunate for anyone to have said that, in any form.
Is it your understanding... that your competitors were engaged in similar activities?
Uh... yes. And, and to a greater extent than us, in most cases.
Hedge fund manager John Paulson... made 12 billion dollars betting against the mortgage market.
When John Paulson ran out of mortgage securities to bet against, he worked with Goldman Sachs and
Deutsche Bank to create more of them.
Morgan Stanley was also selling mortgage securities that it was betting against, and it's now being sued by the government employees retirement fund, of the Virgin Islands for fraud.
The lawsuit alleges that Morgan Stanley knew that the CDO's were junk.
Although they were rated AAA,
Morgan Stanley was betting they would fail.
A year later, Morgan Stanley had made hundreds of millions of dollars, while the investors had lost almost all of their money.
You would have thought that pension funds would have said, "those are subprime... why am I buying them?"
And they had these guys at Moody's and
Standard and Poor's who said, that's a AAA.
None of these securities got issued without the imprimatur, you know, the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, of the rating agencies.
The three rating agencies...
Moody's, S&P, and Fitch... made billions of dollars giving high ratings to risky securities.
Moody's, the largest rating agency, quadrupled its profits between 2000 and 2007.
Moody's and S&P get compensated based on putting out ratings reports.
And the more structured securities they gave a AAA rating to, the higher their earnings were gonna be for the quarter.
Imagine if you went to the New York Times, and you said, look, if you write a positive story, I'll pay you 500,000 dollars.
But if you don't, I'll give you nothing.
The rating agencies could have stopped the party, and said:
We're sorry, you know... we're gonna tighten our standards.
This is, and... and... and immediately cut off... a lot of the flow of funding to risky borrowers.
AAA-rated instruments mushroomed from just a handful to thousands and thousands.
Hundreds of billions of dollars, uh... were being rated. You know, and...
- Per year.
- Per year; oh, yeah.
I’ve now testified before both houses of Congress... on the credit rating agency issue.
And both times, they trot out very prominent First Amendment lawyers, and argue that when we say something is rated AAA, that is merely our opinion you shouldn't rely on it.
S&P's ratings express our opinion.
Our ratings are, uh... are our opinions.
But they're opinions.
Opinions, and those are, they are just opinions.
I think we are emphasizing the fact that our ratings are, uh... uh... are opinions.
They do not speak to the market value of a security, the volatility of its price, or its suitability as an investment.
We have so many economists coming on our air, and saying, oh, this is a bubble, and it's going to burst, and this is going to be a real issue for the economy.
Some say it could even cause a recession at some point.
What is the worst-case scenario, if in fact we were to see... prices come down substantially across the country?
Well, I, I guess I don't buy your premise.
It's a pretty unlikely possibility.
We've never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide ba... a nationwide basis.
Ben Bernanke became chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board in February 2006, the top year for subprime lending.
But despite numerous warnings, Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board did nothing.
Robert Gnaizda met with Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board three times after Bernanke became chairman.
Only at the last meeting... did he suggest that there was a problem, and that the government ought to look into it.
When? When was that? What year?
In 2009, March 11th, in D.C.
- This year.
- This year we met, yes.
And so for the two previous years you met him,
- even in 2008?
- Yes.
One of the six Federal Reserve Board governors serving under Bernanke... was Frederic Mishkin, who was appointed by President Bush in 2006.
Did you participate in the semiannual meetings that, uh...
Robert Gnaizda and, and, uh...
Greenlining... had with the Federal Reserve Board?
Yes I did. I was actually on the committee that, uh... that was involved, involved with that the Consumer Community Affairs Committee.
He warned, in an extremely explicit manner, about what was going on... and he came to the
Federal Reserve Board... with loan documentation of the kind of loans that were... frequently being made.
And he was listened to politely, and nothing was done.
Yeah. So, uh... again,
I... I don't know the details, in terms of, of, uh... of, uh... um... in fact, I... I just don't...
I... I really don't, whatever information he provide,
I'm not sure exactly, that, uh... it's, it's actually, to be honest, I can't remember this, this kind of discussion, but certainly, uh, there, there were issues that were, uh... uh... coming up.
But then the question is, how pervasive are they?
Why didn't you try looking?
I think that people did.
We had people looking at, a whole group of people looking at this,
- for whatever reason...
- Excuse me, you can't be serious.
If you would've looked, you would have found things.
Uh... you know, that's very, very easy to always say that you can always find it.
As early as 2004, the FBI was already warning about an epidemic of mortgage fraud.
They reported inflated appraisals, doctored loan documentation, and other fraudulent activity.
In 2005, the IMF's chief economist,
Raghuram Rajan, warned that dangerous incentives could lead to a crisis.
Then came Nouriel Roubini's warnings in 2006.
Allan Sloan's articles in Fortune magazine and the Washington Post in 2007... and repeated warnings from the IMF.
I said it, and on behalf of the institution: uh, the crisis which is in front of us is a huge crisis.
Who did you talk to?
The government, Treasury, so, the Fed, everybody.
In May of 2007, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman... circulated a presentation called
"Who's Holding the Bag?", which described how the bubble would unravel.
And in early 2008, Charles Morris published his book about the impending crisis.
Easy Money, High Rollers, and the Great Credit Crash.
You're just not sure, what do you do?
And you might have some suspicions that underwriting standards are being weakened but then the question is, should you do anything about it?
By 2008, home foreclosures were skyrocketing, and the securitization food chain imploded.
Lenders could no longer sell their loans to the investment banks... and as the loans went bad, dozens of lenders failed
Chuck Prince, of Citibank, famously said that, uh, uh... we have to dance until the music stops.
Actually, the music had stopped already when he said that.
The market for CDOs collapsed, leaving the investment banks holding hundreds of billions of dollars in loans,
CDOs, and real estate they couldn't sell.
When the crisis started both the Bush administration... and the Federal Reserve were totally behind the curve.
They did not understand the extent of it.
At what point do you remember thinking, for the first time, this is dangerous, this is bad?
I remember very well, uh, one
I think it was a G7 meeting, of February 2008.
And I remember discussing the issue with, with Hank Paulson.
And I clearly remember telling Hank: we are watching this tsunami coming... and just... proposing... that we ask which swimming costume we're going to put on.
What was his response, what was his feeling?
Things are pretty much under control.
Yes, we are looking at, this situation carefully, and uh... yeah, it's under control.
We're gonna keep growing, okay?
And obviously, I'll say it: if you're growing, you're not in recession, right? I mean, we all know that.
In March of 2008, the investment bank
Bear Stearns ran out of cash, and was acquired for two dollars a share by JP Morgan Chase.
The deal was backed by 30 billion dollars in emergency guarantees... from the Federal Reserve.
That was the time when the administration could have come in, and put in place various kinds of measures... that would have reduced system risk.
The information that I'm receiving from some entities... is the end is not here, that there are other shoes to fall.
I've seen those investment banks working with... the Fed and the SEC to strengthen their liquidity, to strengthen their the, their capital positions.
I get reports all the time.
Our regulators are, are very vigilant.
On September 7th, 2008...
Henry Paulson announced the federal takeover... of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two giant mortgage lenders on the brink of collapse.
Nothing about our actions today... in any way reflects a changed view... of the housing correction or the strength... of other U.S. financial institutions.
Two days later, Lehman Brothers announced record losses... of 3.2 billion dollars, and its stock collapsed.
The effects of Lehman and AIG in September... still came as a surprise.
I mean, this is even after July, and Fannie and Freddie. So... clearly, there was stuff that as of September... major stuff... that nobody knew about.
I think that's, I think that's fair.
Bear Stearns was rated AAA, like, a month before it went bankrupt?
- Uh... more likely A2.
- A2.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- A2 is still not bankrupt.
- No no no. No.
That's, that's a high investment grade, solid investment-grade rating
Lehman Brothers; A2, within days of failing.
Um... AIG, AA, within days of being bailed out.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were AAA when they were rescued.
Um... Citigroup, Merrill, all, all of 'em had investment-grade ratings.
How can that be?
Well, that's a good question.
That's a great question
At no point did the administration ever go to all the major institutions, and say, you know: this is serious, tell us what your positions are, you know, uh... no bullshit, where are you?
Well, first, that's what the regulators, that's their job, right?
Their job is to understand the exposure... across these different institutions, and they have a very refined, uh... understanding that I think became more respon, more refined... as the crisis, um, proceeded. So...
Forgive me, but that's clearly not true. I m
What do you mean, it's not true?
In August of 2008, were you aware of the, the credit ratings held then by
Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG... and did you think that they were accurate?
Well, uh... uh... certainly by that time, it was clear... that that earlier credit ratings were inaccurate, because they had been downgraded substantially.
No they hadn't.
Uh... there's still, there was still some downgrading, in terms of the, the industry, concerns of the ind... certainly the stock prices
Not some, all those firms were rated at least A2... until a couple of days before they, uh... were rescued.
Well then, you know, then the answer is,
I just don't, don't know enough to... really answer your question on this particular issue.
Governor Fred Mishkin is resigning, effective August 31.
He says he plans to return to his teaching post... at Columbia's Graduate School of Business.
Why did you leave the Federal Reserve in August of 2008?
I mean, in, in the middle of the worst financial crisis.
So, so, uh, that, uh...
I had to, to revise a textbook.
His departure leaves the Fed board with three of its seven seats vacant... just when the economy needs it most.
Well, I'm sure your textbook is important and widely read.
But in August of 2008, you know, some, somewhat more important things were going on in the world, don't you think?
By Friday, September 12th,
Lehman Brothers had run out of cash, and the entire investment banking industry was sinking fast.
The stability of the global financial system was in jeopardy.
That weekend, Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner, president of the New York
Federal Reserve... called an emergency meeting with the CEO's of the major banks... in an effort to rescue Lehman.
But Lehman wasn't alone.
Merrill Lynch, another major investment bank, was also on the brink of failure.
And that Sunday, it was acquired by Bank of America.
The only bank interested in buying
Lehman was the British firm Barclay's.
But British regulators demanded a financial guarantee from the U.S. government.
Paulson refused.
We all jumped into a yellow cab and went down to the Federal Reserve Bank.
They wanted the bankruptcy case commenced before midnight... of September 14.
We kept pressing that this would be a, uh... terrible event.
And at some point,
I used the word "Armageddon".
Had they fully considered the consequences of what they were proposing?
The effect on the market would be extraordinary.
- You said this?
- Yes.
They just said they had considered all of the comments that we had made... and they were still of the belief... that in order to calm the markets and move forward it was necessary for Lehman to go into bankruptcy.
- Calm the markets?
- Yes.
When were you first told that
Lehman in fact was going to go bankrupt?
Ah, after the fact.
After the fact?
Wow. Okay.
And... what was your reaction when you learned of it?
Holy cow.
Paulson and Bernanke had not consulted with other governments and didn't understand the consequences of foreign bankruptcy laws.
Under British law, Lehman's
London office had to be closed immediately.
All transactions came to a halt.
And there are thousands and thousands and thousands of transactions.
The hedge funds who had had assets with Lehman in London... discovered overnight, to their complete horror, that they couldn't get those assets back.
One of the points of the hub failed.
And that had huge knock-on effects around the system.
The oldest money market fund in the nation... wrote off roughly three quarters of a billion dollars in bad debt... issued by the now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers.
Lehman's failure also caused a collapse in the commercial paper market, which many companies depend on... to pay for operating expenses, such as payroll.
That means maybe they have to lay off employees... they can't buy parts.
It stops business in its tracks.
Suddenly, people stood, and said:
Listen; what can we believe in?
There's nothing we can trust anymore.
That same week,
AIG owed 13 billion dollars... to holders of credit default swaps... and it didn't have the money.
AIG was another hub.
If AIG had stopped, you know, all planes may have to be, you know, stop flying.
On September 17th,
AIG is taken over by the government.
And one day later,
Paulson and Bernanke... ask Congress for 700 billion dollars to bail out the banks.
They warn that the alternative would be a catastrophic financial collapse.
It was scary. You know, the entire system froze up... every part of the financial system, every part of the credit system.
Nobody could borrow money.
It was like a cardiac arrest of the global financial system. am playing the hand that was dealt me. a lot of what I am dealing with, you know,
I'm dealing with the consequences of things that were done, often, many years ago.
Secretary Paulson spoke throughout the fall.
And all the potential root causes of this... and there are plenty... he called 'em, uh... so I... I'm not sure...
You're not being serious about that,
- are you?
- I am being serious.
What... what would you have expected? Uh...
A... and what're you, what were you looking for that you didn't see?
He was the senior advocate... for prohibiting the regulation of credit default swaps... and also lifting the leverage limits on the investment banks.
- So a-, again, what
- He mentioned those things?
I never heard him mention those things.
C... can we turn this off for a second?
When AIG was bailed out, the owners of its credit default swaps... the most prominent of which was Goldman Sachs... were paid 61 billion dollars the next day.
Paulson, Bernanke, and Tim Geithner forced AIG... to pay 100 cents on the dollar, rather than negotiate lower prices...
Eventually, the AIG bailout cost taxpayers over 150 billion dollars.
A hundred and sixty billion dollars went through AIG,
14 billion went to Goldman Sachs.
At the same time,
Paulson and Geithner forced AIG... to surrender its right to sue
Goldman and the other banks for fraud.
Isn't there a problem when the person in charge of dealing with this crisis... is the former CEO of Goldman Sachs... someone who had a major role in causing it?
Well, I think it's fair to say that the financial markets today... are incredibly complicated. supply urgently needed money...
On October 4th, 2008,
President Bush... signs a 700-billion-dollar bailout bill.
But world stock markets continue to fall, amid fears that a global recession is now underway...
The bailout legislation does nothing to stem the tide of layoffs and foreclosures.
Unemployment in the United States and Europe quickly rises to 10 percent.
The recession accelerates, and spreads globally.
I began to get really scared,
'cause I hadn't foreseen... the whole world going down at the same rate at the same time.
December of 2008,
General Motors and Chrysler... are facing bankruptcy.
And as U.S. consumers cut back on spending,
Chinese manufacturers see sales plummet.
Over 10 million migrant workers in China lose their jobs. the end of the day, the poorest, as always, pay the most.
Here you can earn a lot of money, like, uh,
70, 80, uh, U.S. dollars per month.
As a farmer in the countryside, you cannot earn as much money.
The workers just wire their salaries to their hometown.
To give to their families.
The crisis started in America.
We all know it will be coming to China.
Some of the factories try to cut off some workers.
Some people will get poor because they’ll lose their jobs.
Life gets harder.
We were growing at about 20 percent.
It was a super year.
And then we suddenly went to minus nine this quarter.
Exports collapsed.
And we're talking like 30 percent.
So we just took a hit, you know, fell off a cliff, boom!
Even as the crisis unfolded, we didn't know how wide it was going to spread, or how severe it was going to be.
And we were still hoping that there would be some... way for us to have a shelter... and be, uh, less battered by the storm.
But it is not possible.
It's a very globalized world the economies are all linked together.
Every time a home goes into foreclosure, it affects everyone who lives around that house.
'Cause when that property goes on the market, it's gonna be sold at a lower price... maybe before it goes on the market, it won't be well maintained.
We estimate another 9 million homeowners will lose their homes.
We went out on a weekend|to see... what houses were for sale.
We saw one we liked.
The payment was going to be
3200 dollars.
Everything was beautifull, the house was very pretty.
The payments were low.
Everything was like... we won the lottery.
But the reality set in when the first payment arrived.
I felt really, really bad for my husband, because... he works too much.
And we have three children.
The vast majority I've seen lately, unfortunately, are people who have just been hurt by the economy.
They were living, you know, day to day, paycheck to paycheck, and unfortunately, that ran out
And unemployment isn't gonna pay a house mortgage... it's not gonna pay a car bill.
I was a log-truck driver.
And they shut down, they shut down... all the logging systems up there... shut down the sawmills and everything.
So I moved down here,
I had a construction job.
And the construction jobs got shut down too so... things are so tough... there's a lot o' people out there, and pretty soon... you're gonna be seeing more camps like this around because there's just no jobs right now.
When the company did well, we did well when the company did not do well, sir, we did not do well.
The men who destroyed their own companies... and plunged the world into crisis... walked away from the wreckage with their fortunes intact.
The top five executives at Lehman Brothers... made over a billion dollars between 2000 and 2007... and when the firm went bankrupt... they got to keep all the money.
The system worked.
It doesn't make any sense for us to make a loan that's gonna fail,
'cause we lose. They lose the borrower loses, the community loses, and we lose.
Countrywide's CEO Angelo Mozilo... made 470 million dollars between 2003 and 2008.
One hundred forty million... came from dumping his
Countrywide stock... in the 12 months before the company collapsed.
Ultimately, I hold the board accountable when a business fails.
'Cause the board is responsible for hiring and firing the CEO... and overseeing big strategic decisions.
The problem with board composition in America... is the way boards are elected.
The boards are pretty much, in many cases, picked by the CEO.
The board of directors and the compensation committees... are the two bodies best situated... to determine the pay packages, uh... for executives.
How do you think they’ve done over the past 10 years?
Well, I think that, if you look at those, uh, in, I would give about a B. Because...
- A B?
- Yes.
- Not an F.
- Not an F, not an F.
Stan O'Neal, the CEO of Merrill Lynch... received 90 million dollars in 2006 and 2007 alone.
After driving his firm into the ground.
Merrill Lynch's board of directors allowed him to resign... and he collected
161 million dollars in severance.
Instead of being fired,
Stan O'Neal is allowed to resign... and takes away 151 million dollars.
That's a decision that that board of directors made at that point.
And what grade do you give that decision?
Uh, that's a tougher one. I don't know if I would give that one a B as well.
O'Neal's successor, John Thain, was paid 87 million dollars in 2007... and in December of 2008, two months after Merrill was bailed out by U.S. taxpayers
Thain and Merrill's board handed out billions in bonuses.
In March of 2008...
AIG's Financial Products Division lost 11 billion dollars
Instead of being fired, Joseph Cassano, the head of AIG FP... was kept on as a consultant... for a million dollars a month.
And you want to make sure that the key players... and the key, key employees, uh... within AIG FP... yeah, we retain that intellectual knowledge.
I attended a very interesting, uh, dinner, organized by Hank Paulson a little more than one year ago... with some officials and a couple of, uh...
CEOs from the biggest, uh, banks in the U.S.
And, uh... surprisingly enough, all these gentlemen... were arguing we were too greedy, so we have part responsibility. Fine.
And then they were turning to the treasurer, to the secretary of the Treasury, and say, you should regulate more because we are too greedy... we can't avoid it.
The only way to avoid this is to have more regulation.
I have spoken to many bankers about... this question, including very senior ones.
And this is the first time that I've ever heard anybody say... that they actually wanted their compensation to be regulated.
Yeah, because it was at the moment where they were afraid.
And after, when solution to the crisis began to appear... then probably they, they changed their mind.
In the U.S., the banks are now bigger, more powerful, and more concentrated than ever before.
There are fewer competitors, and a lot of smaller banks... have been taken over by big ones.
JP Morgan today is even bigger than it was before.
JP Morgan took over first Bear Stearns and then WAMU.
Bank of America took over
Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.
Wells Fargo took over Wachovia.
After the crisis, the financial industry... including the
Financial Services Roundtable... worked harder than ever to fight reform. he financial sector employs
3,000 lobbyists... more than five for each member of Congress.
Do you think the financial services industry... has excessive political influence in the United States?
No. I think that every person in, in the wo... in the country is represented here in Washington.
And you think that all segments of American society... have equal and fair access to the system?
Yet, you can walk into any hearing room, uh... that you would like.
Yes, I do.
Um... one could walk into any hearing room... one can not necessarily write the kind of lobbying checks... that your industry writes... or engage in the level of political contributions... that your industry engages in.
Between 1998 and 2008... the financial industry spent over 5 billion dollars... on lobbying and campaign contributions.
And since the crisis, they're spending even more money.
The financial industry also exerts its influence... in a more subtle way... one that most Americans don't know about.
It has corrupted the study of economics itself.
Deregulation had tremendous financial and intellectual support.
Because, uh, uh... people argued it for their own benefit.
Economics profession was the main source of that illusion.
Since the 1980s, academic economists... have been major advocates of deregulation, and played powerful roles in shaping
U.S. government policy.
Very few of these economic experts warned about the crisis.
And even after the crisis, many of them opposed reform.
The guys who taught these things tended to get paid a lot of money being consultants.
Business school professors don't live on a faculty salary.
They do very, very well.
Over the last decade, the financial services industry... has made about
5 billion dollars worth of... political contributions in the United States.
That's kind of a lot of money.
That doesn't bother you?
No.
Martin Feldstein is a professor at Harvard, and one of the world's most prominent economists.
As President Reagan's chief economic advisor, he was a major architect of deregulation.
And from 1988 until 2009, he was on the board of directors of both AIG and AIG Financial Products, which paid him millions of dollars.
You have any regrets about having been on AIG's board?
I have no comments.
No, I have no regrets... about being on AIG's board.
- None.
- Than I can say, absolutely none.
Absolutely none.
Okay. Um...
You have any regrets about, uh...
AIG's decisions?
I cannot say anything more about AIG.
I've taught at Northwestern and Chicago,
Harvard and Columbia.
Glenn Hubbard is the dean of Columbia Business School... and was the chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers... under George W. Bush.
Do you think the financial services industry has too much, uh... political power in the United States?
I don't think so, no. You certainly, you certainly wouldn't get that impression... by the drubbing that they regularly get, uh... in Washington.
Many prominent academics quietly make fortunes... while helping the financial industry shape public debate... and government policy.
The Analysis Group,
Charles River Associates,
Compass Lexecon, and the Law and Economics Consulting Group... manage a multi-billion-dollar industry... that provides academic experts for hire.
Two bankers who used these services were Ralph Ciofi... and Matthew Tannin,
Bear Stearns hedge fund managers prosecuted for securities fraud.
After hiring The Analysis Group, both were acquitted.
Glenn Hubbard was paid
100,000 dollars... to testify in their defense.
Do you think that the economics discipline has, uh... a conflict of interest problem?
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Do you think that a significant fraction of the economics discipline, a number of economists, have financial conflicts of interests... that in some way might call into question or color.
Oh, I see what you're saying. I doubt it.
You know, most academic economists, uh... you know, aren't wealthy business people.
Hubbard makes 250,000 dollars a year... as a board member of Met Life... and was formerly on the board of Capmark, a major commercial mortgage lender during the bubble, which went bankrupt in 2009.
He has also advised Nomura Securities,
KKR Financial Corporation, and many other financial firms.
Laura Tyson, who declined to be interviewed for this film, is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
She was the chair of the
Council of Economic Advisers, and then director of the
National Economic Council... in the Clinton administration.
Shortly after leaving government, she joined the board of Morgan Stanley... which pays her 350,000 dollars a year.
Ruth Simmons, the president of Brown University, makes over 300,000 dollars a year... on the board of Goldman Sachs.
Larry Summers, who as Treasury secretary... played a critical role in the deregulation of derivatives... became president of Harvard in 2001.
While at Harvard, he made millions consulting to hedge funds... and millions more in speaking fees, much of it from investment banks.
According to his federal disclosure report,
Summers's net worth is between
16.5 million and 39.5 million dollars.
Frederic Mishkin, who returned to Columbia Business School... after leaving the Federal Reserve, reported on his federal disclosure report... that his net worth was between 6 million and 17 million dollars.
In 2006, you coauthored a study...
- of Iceland's financial system.
- Right, right.
Iceland is also an advanced country with excellent institutions, low corruption, rule of law.
The economy has already adjusted to financial liberalization... while prudential regulation and supervision is generally quite strong.
Yeah. And that was the mistake.
That it turns out that, uh... that the prudential regulation and supervision was not strong in Iceland.
- And particularly during this period...
- So what led you to think that it was?
I think that, uh... you're going with the information you have and... and generally, uh... the view was that, that, uh... hat Iceland had very good institutions.
It was a very advanced country.
Who told you that?
Who did, what kind of research did you do?
You, you talk to people, you have faith in, in, uh the Central Bank... which actually did fall down on the job.
Uh... that, uh... clearly, it, this, uh...
Why do you have "faith" in a central bank?
Well, that faith, you, ya, d-, because you had, go with the information you have.
Um... how much were you paid to write it?
I was paid, uh... I think the number was, uh... it's public information.
Uh... on your CV, the title of this report has been changed... from "Financial Stability in Iceland" to "Financial Instability in Iceland".
Oh. Well, I don't know, if, which... whatever it is, is, the, uh... thing... if it's a typo, there's a typo.
I think what should be publicly available is... whenever anybody does research on a topic... they disclose if they have any financial conflict with that research.
But if I recall, there is no policy to that effect.
I can't imagine anybody not doing that... in terms of putting it in a paper.
If you would, there would be significant professional sanction... for failure to do that.
I didn't see any place in the study where... you indicated that you had been paid, uh... by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce to produce it.
- No, I
- Okay.
Richard Portes, the most famous economist in Britain... and a professor at London Business School... was also commissioned by the Icelandic
Chamber of Commerce in 2007... to write a report which praised the Icelandic financial sector.
The banks themselves are highly liquid.
They've actually made money on the fall of the Icelandic krona.
These are strong banks, their funding, their market funding is assured for the coming year.
These are well-run banks.
Richard, thank you so much.
Like Mishkin, Portes's report... didn't disclose his payment from the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce.
Does Harvard require disclosures of financial conflict of interest in publications?
Um, not to my knowledge.
Do you require people to report the compensation... they’ve received from outside activities?
- No
Don't you think that's a problem?
I don't see why.
Martin Feldstein being on the board of AIG
Laura Tyson going on the board of Morgan Stanley, uh...
Larry Summer's making
10 million dollars a year... consulting to financial services firms...
Irrelevant.
Well, uh... yeah, basically irrelevant.
You've written a very large number of articles... about a very wide array of subjects.
You never saw fit to investigate the risks... of unregulated credit default swaps?
I never did.
Same question with regard to executive compensation... the regulation of corporate governance...
- the effect of political contributions...
- What, uh... what, uh... w...
I don't know that I would have anything... to add to those discussions.
I'm looking at your resume now.
It looks to me as if the majority... of your outside activities are, uh... consulting and directorship arrangements with... the financial services industry.
Is that, would you not agree with that characterization?
No, to my knowledge,
I don't think my consulting clients are even on my CV, so...
Uh... who are your consulting clients?
I don't believe
I have to discuss that with you.
Okay.
Look, you have a few more minutes, and the interview is over.
Do you consult for any financial services firms?
Uh... the answer is, I do.
- And...
- And, but I do...
I do not want to go into details about that.
Do they include other financial services firms?
Possibly.
You don't remember?
This isn't a deposition, sir.
I was polite enough to give you time, foolishly, I now see.
But you have three more minutes.
Give it your best shot.
In 2004, at the height of the bubble,
Glenn Hubbard coauthored a widely read paper with William C. Dudley the chief economist of Goldman Sachs.
In the paper, Hubbard praised credit derivatives... and the securitization chain... stating that they had improved allocation of capital, and were enhancing financial stability.
He cited reduced volatility in the economy... and stated that recessions... had become less frequent and milder.
Credit derivatives were protecting banks against losses... and helping to distribute risk.
A medical researcher writes an article, saying: to treat this disease, you should prescribe this drug.
It turns out Doctor makes 80% of... personal income from manufacturer of this drug.
Does not bother you.
I think, uh... it's certainly important to disclose... the, um... the, um...
Well, I think that's also a little different from cases... that we are talking about here.
Because, um... um...
So, uh, what do you think this says about the economics discipline?
Well, heh heh, it has no relevance to anything, really.
And indeed, I think, um... it's a part of the, it's a... important part of the problem
PART V: WHERE WE ARE NOW
The rising power of the U.S. financial sector... was part of a wider change in America.
Since the 1980's, the United States has become... a more unequal society, and its economic dominance has declined.
Companies like General Motors,
Chrysler, and U.S. Steel... formerly the core of the U.S. economy... were poorly managed... and falling behind their foreign competitors.
And as countries like China opened their economies,
American companies sent jobs overseas to save money.
For many, many years, the 660 million people in the developed world... were effectively sheltered... from all of this additional labor... that existed on the planet.
Suddenly, the Bamboo Curtain and the Iron Curtain are lifted... and you have 2.5 billion additional people.
American factory workers were laid off by the tens of thousands.
Our manufacturing base was destroyed, literally over the course of a few years.
As manufacturing declined, other industries rose.
The United States leads the world in information technology, where high-paying jobs are easy to find.
But those jobs require an education.
And for average Americans, college is increasingly out of reach.
While top private universities like Harvard... have billions of dollars in their endowments... funding for public universities is shrinking, and tuition is rising.
Tuition for California's public universities... rose from 650 dollars in the 1970's, to over 10,000 dollars in 2010.
Increasingly, the most important determinant... of whether Americans go to college is whether they can find the money to pay for it.
Meanwhile,
American tax policy shifted... to favor the wealthy.
When I first came to office,
I thought taxes were too high, and they were.
The most dramatic change was a series of tax cuts... designed by Glenn Hubbard... who at the time was serving... as President Bush's chief economic advisor.
The Bush administration sharply reduced taxes on investment gains, stock dividends, and eliminated the estate tax.
We had a comprehensive plan... that, when acted has left nearly 1.1 trillion dollars... in the hands of American workers, families, investors, and small business owners.
Most of the benefits of these tax cuts... went to the wealthiest 1% of Americans.
And by the way, it was really the cornerstone, in many ways, of our economic recovery policy.
Inequality of wealth in the United States... is now higher than in any other developed country.
American families responded to these changes in two ways: by working longer hours, and by going into debt.
As the middle class falls further and further behind, there is a political urge to respond... by making it easier to get credit.
You don't have to have a lousy home.
The low-income home buyer... can have just as nice a house as anybody else.
American families borrowed to finance their homes... their cars, their healthcare, and their children's educations.
People in the bottom 90%... lost ground between 1980 and 2007.
It all went to the top 1 percent.
For the first time in history, average Americans have less education... and are less prosperous than their parents.
The era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street... and in Washington... has led us to a financial crisis as serious as any that we have faced since the Great Depression.
When the financial crisis struck... just before the 2008 election...
Barack Obama pointed to Wall Street greed... and regulatory failures... as examples of the need for change in America.
A lack of oversight in Washington... and on Wall Street is exactly... what got us into this mess.
After taking office, President Obama... spoke of the need to reform the financial industry.
We want a systemic-risk regulator, increased capital requirements.
We need a consumer financial protection agency... we need to change Wall Street's culture.
But when finally enacted in mid-2010... the administration's financial reforms were weak... and in some critical areas, including the rating agencies... lobbying, and compensation... nothing significant was even proposed.
Addressing Obama and, quote, regulatory reform: my response, if it was one word, would be: Ha!
There’s very little reform.
How come?
It's a Wall Street government.
Obama chose Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary.
Geithner was the president of the New York Federal Reserve... during the crisis... and one of the key players... in the decision to pay Goldman Sachs...
100 cents on the dollar... for its bets against mortgages.
When Tim Geithner was testifying... to be confirmed as Treasury secretary... he said: "I have never been a regulator".
Now that said to me, he did not understand his job... as president of the New York Fed.
The new president of the New York Fed is William C. Dudley, the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs... whose paper with Glenn Hubbard praised derivatives.
Geithner's chief of staff is Mark Paterson... a former lobbyist for Goldman... and one of the senior advisors is Lewis Sachs... who oversaw Tricadia... a company heavily involved in betting against... the mortgage securities it was selling.
To head the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission...
Obama picked Gary Gensler.
A former Goldman Sachs executive... who had helped ban the regulation of derivatives...
To run the Securities and Exchange Commission...
Obama picked Mary Shapiro... the former CEO of FINRA... the investment-banking industry's self-regulation body.
Obama's chief of staff,
Rahm Emanuel... made 320,000 dollars... serving on the board of Freddie Mac.
Both Martin Feldstein and Laura Tyson... are members of Obama's
Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
And Obama's chief economic advisor is Larry Summers.
The most senior economic advisors... are the very people who were there, who built the structure.
When it was clear that Summers and Geithner... were going to play major roles as advisors...
I knew this was going to be status quo.
The Obama administration resisted regulation of bank compensation... even as foreign leaders took action.
I think the financial industry is a service industry... it should serve others before it serves itself.
In September of 2009,
Christine Lagarde and the finance ministers of Sweden, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
Italy, Spain, and Germany... called for the G20 nations, including the United States... to impose strict regulations on bank compensation.
And in July of 2010, the European Parliament... enacted those very regulations.
The Obama administration had no response.
Their view is, this is a temporary blip... and things will go back to normal.
And that is why
I am reappointing him... to another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Thank you so much, Ben.
In 2009, Barack Obama reappointed
Ben Bernanke.
Thank you, Mr. President
As of mid-2010, not a single senior financial executive... had been criminally prosecuted, or even arrested... no special prosecutor had been appointed... not a single financial firm... had been prosecuted criminally... for securities fraud or accounting fraud.
The Obama administration has made no attempt... to recover any of the compensation... given to financial executives during the bubble.
I certainly would think of criminal action... against some of Countrywide's top leaders... like Mozilo
I'd certainly look at Bear Stearns,
Goldman Sachs... and Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch
- For criminal prosecutions.
- Yes. Yes.
They'd be very hard to, to win...
But I think they could do it... if they got enough underlings to tell the truth.
In an industry in which drug use, prostitution, and fraudulent billing of prostitutes as a business expense... occur on an industrial scale... it wouldn't be hard to make people talk, if you really wanted to.
They gave me a plea bargain, and I took it.
Um... they were not interested in any of my records... they weren't interested in anything.
They were not interested in your records?
That's correct. That's correct.
There is a sensibility that you don't use people's... personal vices in the context of Wall Street cases... necessarily, to get them to flip.
I think maybe it's, after the cataclysms that we've been through... maybe people will reevaluate that..
I'm not the one to pass judgment on that right now.
You come to us today, telling us: we're sorry, we didn't mean it... we won't do it again, trust us.
Well, I have some people in my constituency... that actually robbed some of your banks.
And they say the same thing!
They're sorry, they didn't mean it... they won't do it again
In 2009, as unemployment hit its highest level in 17 years..
Morgan Stanley paid its employees over 14 billion dollars... and Goldman Sachs paid out over 16 billion.
In 2010, bonuses were even higher.
Why should a financial engineer be paid four, four times... to a hundred times more than the, uh... real engineer?
A real engineer build bridges... a financial engineer build, build dreams.
And when those dream turn out to be nightmares, other people pay for it.
For decades, the American financial system was stable and safe.
But then something changed.
The financial industry turned its back on society... corrupted our political system, and plunged the world economy into crisis.
At enormous cost, we’ve avoided disaster, and are recovering.
But the men and institutions that caused the crisis are still in power... and that needs to change.
They will tell us that we need them... and that what they do is too complicated for us to understand.
They will tell us it won't happen again.
They will spend billions fighting reform.
It won't be easy
But some things are worth fighting for...

What the movie is... is about is when a band is developing, it goes through certain stages, and for us, like, we're not the same band we were when we recorded the War album, for instance.
And we captured that on
Under a Blood Red Sky, and we just wanted to capture this period of... of the band to...

Well, we wrote the song l Still Haven't Found
What l'm Looking For, which is a gospel song pretty much. lt doesn't sound much like a gospel song the way we do it, but if you look at the lyric and the basic music, that's exactly what it is.
We got a cassette from a friend of ours at lsland Records of a gospel choir covering the song, and it sounded like-- lt sounded totally different, but it sounded really exciting and new.
So we traveled down to Harlem and visited this church in the middle of Harlem where this choir were going through a rehearsal, and we played with them and got the idea to do a kind of combination arrangement.

Silver and gold
Silver and gold
Ooh
Ooh l see the coming and the going l've seen them captains and kings l've seen their navy blue uniform
See them bright and shiny things
Bright and shiny things
Yeah
The temperature is rising
The fever white-hot
Mister, l ain't got nothin'
But it's more than you got
Chains no longer bind me
Not the shackles at my feet
Outside are the prisoners lnside the free
Set them free
Set them free
A prizefighter in a corner is told
Hit where it hurts
For silver and gold
Silver and gold
Yeah.
Silver and Gold.
This song was written in a hotel room in New York City... round about the time a friend of ours,
Little Steven, was putting together a record of artists against apartheid. lt's a song written about a man... in a shantytown outside of Johannesburg...
A man who's sick of looking down the barrel of white
South Africa, a man who is at the point where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor...
A man who has lost faith in the peacemakers of the west while they argue and while they fail to support a man like Bishop Tutu...
[Crowd Cheering] and his request for economic sanctions against South Africa.
Am l bugging you? l don't mean to bug you.
O.K., Edge, play the blues.
[Crowd Cheering]
[Woman]
Have you already started writing for this next album, and being so influenced by American music, will it incorporate some American music?
We went to Sun Studios in Memphis.
Even though it's been a barbershop and even though it's been a few other things, like a store, the exact same studio exists and even the same tiles.
And we got Cowboy
Jack Clement down.
He recorded
Jerry Lee Lewis'
Whole Lotta Shakin'
Goin' On.
And we recorded five new songs in five hours.
[Playing Angel Of Harlem]
[Bono]
Angel Of Harlem.
[Music Stops]
[Man]
Larry Mullen, Jr. l don't have a mike on.
You don't know what l'm saying.
[The Edge] lf l had those feet, l wouldn't want them in the film. lf l had a head like yours, l'd bleedin' bury it.
[Playing Angel Of Harlem] lt was a cold and wet
December day
When we touched the ground at JFK lt was sunset over Uncle Sam
Charlie and the birdman
And Angel
New York like a Christmas tree
At night, this city belongs to me
Angel
Soul love
This love won't let me go
Oh, oh, oh
So long
Angel of Harlem
Blue light on the avenue
God knows when they got to you
Strung out, you learn to sing
Your eyes swollen like a bee sting
Birdland on 53
The streets sound like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and the Love Supreme
Miles, and she's got to be
An angel
Soul love
Well, this love won't let me go
So long
Angel of Harlem
Mmm, hmm, hmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Well, when you're on the road for that long, sometimes you just feel like doing something that isn't on the schedule and just shaking it up a bit. lt's just, like, music can get so boring, so conservative, so predictable.
[Crowd Cheering]
We've got a flatbed truck set up in front of the plaza with your gear.
Whenever you're ready, we can go.
We're ready right now.
We've got to work out
All Along the Watchtower.
Who do we know that knows the words to
All Along the Watchtower?
There must be some way out of here
What's going on?
We could try it in C.
There must be some way out of here
[Adam]
B, C, A-flat--
A-sharp, rather.
[Playing
All Along The Watchtower]
O.K.
"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There is too much confusion here"
"l can't get no relief" l think that's close. ls that O.K.?
Are we going?
[Adam]
Let's go.
[All Along The Watchtower
Playing]
"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There is too much confusion here"
"l can't get no relief"
"Businessmen, they drink my wine"
"Plowmen dig my earth"
"None of them know along the line"
"What any of this is worth, yeah"
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many among us, yeah"
"Who think that life is but a joke"
"But you and l, we've been through that"
"And that is not our fate"
"So let us not talk falsely now"
"Because the hour is getting late"
Hey, hey, hey
Uh, uh, uh
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While her husband came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Yeah.
"Rock 'n' roll... stops the traffic."
All l've got is a red guitar
Three chords, and the truth
All l've got is a red guitar
The rest is up to you
"There's no reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are some among us here"
"Who say that life is just a joke"
"You and l, we've been through that"
"And that is not our fate, at least today"
"So let us not talk falsely now"
"Because the hour is getting late, late"
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ln God's Country.
[ln God's Country Begins]
Desert sky
Dream beneath the desert sky
The rivers run, but soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight
Desert rose
Dreamed l saw a desert rose
Her dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren, she calls to me
Sleep comes like a drug ln God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses ln God's country, yeah
Yeah
Naked flame
She stands, a naked flame l stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love
Whoa, oh, oh,
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That was good.
Really smashing the cymbals there, huh?
You want to change this?
Pass me a tissue please, Fintan.
Thank you.
[Bono]
Right, with the B.B. King song, watch for the third verse.
Not the first verse, the first chorus, not the second verse--
But the third verse.
But the third verse, which comes after the chorus. l start to count.
Then you come in.
Keep looking at me.
Stand beside me.
We should all look at Larry?
Just be in the right.
Make sure because when we get on there, so we're all prepared, just stand beside me-- boom, and in-- because Edge is on a completely different timing, as usual.
[Bono]
Let me introduce to you-- l'd like to introduce to you somebody whose music we've just come to know and love over the last year or so and his incredible band.
This is B.B. King and B.B. King's band here.
Where's B.B.?
Believe it or not,
B.B. King came to Dublin, lreland.
He was playing in this club in Dublin, lreland, and we wrote this song for him. lt's called
When Love Comes To Town. l went to listen to the tape. l was able to kind of get some of it together. l hope you liked the song. l love the song. l think that the lyric is really...
Real heavy lyrics.
You're mighty young to write such heavy lyrics.
Ha ha ha!
You know, l'm one of those rebel-like guys. l like to get in there and see what's going on.
Break the mold a little.
That's right. Yeah.
They kind of... look at me kind of weird.
They say,
"Here he is, a 62-year-old, and look what he's trying to do."
You're 62?
Yeah, l'm 62. l'm no good with chords, so what we do is... get somebody else to play chords, and--
Well, Edge will do that.
There's not much chords in this song. l think there's only two. l'm horrible with chords.
[Band Playing Quietly] l don't know what to do there. l'm just-- l'm just--
Go ahead. yeah.
Was that a joke?
Ha ha! l was a sailor, l was lost at sea l was under the waves before love rescued me l was a fighter, l could turn on a thread
But l stand accused of the things l've said
When love comes to town l'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that flame
Baby, l was wrong
To ever let you down
But l did what l did
Before love came to town l used to make love under the red sunset l was making promises l was soon to forget
"Pale as the lace on her wedding gown."
Are you scared?
"l left her standing before love came to town."
Ran into a juke joint
When l heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue
And l fell into a dream
As the music played l saw my life turn around
But that was the day before love came to town
When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that train
When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that flame
Baby, l was wrong
To ever let you down
But l did what l did
Before love came to town
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
"l held the scabbard when the soldier drew the sword. l threw the dice when they pierced his side, but l've seen love conquer the great divide."
When love comes to town, l'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town, l'm gonna catch that flame
Baby, l was wrong to ever let you down
But l did what l did
Before love came to town
[Bono]
Thank you. Good night!
Ha ha ha!
All right.
Might as well go for it.
[B.B.]
Lot of emotion right there.
That's all right, young man.
That's all right.
See the sun rise over her skin
Don't change it
Woo!
See the sun rise over her...
Yo!
Thumb a lift there, Edge.
Dawn changes everything
Everything
And the Delta sun
Burns bright and violent
Mississippi and the cotton wool heat
66, a highway speaks
Of deserts dry
Of cool green valleys
Gold and silver mines... l was a little bit disturbed about going to Graceland, to be honest, because unlike what some of the other guys are saying, l loved the Elvis movies. l used to watch them because it was great to see a film star who was a musician. ln every single one of his movies, he wasn't acting as a car salesman.
He was acting as a car salesman who loved to play guitar. l really related to that because l worked myself for a couple of years. l was a glorified messenger boy, but l loved to play the drums. l related to that. l loved the Elvis movies.
Over her skin
She feels like water in my hand
Freeway like a river cuts through this land lnto the side of love like a burning spear
And the poison rain brings a flood of fear
Through the ghost ranch here
Can we get a photograph on the bike?
Um, well, we can--ha ha!
How about the snowmobile?
The snowmobile.
Well, this man--
What Harley-Davidson means to this man, you would not know.
[Woman]
How about--
How about off-camera?
That would be fine.
Just like a personal photograph.
We'll keep this away.
O.K., you can do that. ln this heartland
Heaven knows, this is the heartland
Heart, heartland,
Hey, yeah
Heaven knows, this is the heartland
Heartland
Heartland l was worried that our involvement, that us going to Graceland would take away from him and take away from us.
When l got there, l enjoyed it and all that, but seeing the graves and, like, the eternal flame and all that just seemed-- it seemed very distant. l wish he hadn't been buried in there-- in the, uh, back garden. l really wish that he'd been buried somewhere where l couldn't have gone. l would have felt better. l don't know why. lt's just one of those things, you know.
[Bad Begins] lf you twist and turn away lf you tear yourself in two again lf l could, you know l would lf l could, l would let it go
Surrender
Dislocate lf l could throw this lifeless lifeline
To the wind
Leave this heart of clay
See you walk, walk away lnto the night
Through the day lf l could, through myself
Set your spirit free l'd lead your heart away
See you break, break away lnto the light
Through the day lnto the half-light
Through the flame
Singing
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

So let it go, uh-huh

So let it go, uh-huh
And so fade away
Wide-awake l'm wide-awake
Wide-awake l'm not sleeping
Oh, no l'm not sleeping lf they should ask
Well, maybe they'd tell me what l should say
True colors fly in blue and black
Through silken sky and burnin' flag
Colors crash, collide in bloodshot eyes lf l could, you know l would lf l could, l would let it go
This desperation
Separation
Condemnation ln temptation lsolation, revelation lsolation, revelation
Let it go, uh-huh

[With Or Without You Begins]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side l'll wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails, she makes me wait
And l wait without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all, but l want more
And l'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you, oh l can't live
With or without you
Yeah, you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away

There are--There are people who would say that you shouldn't mix music and politics or sport and politics or whatever, but l think that's kind of bullshit.
[Crowd Cheering]
[The Star-Spangled
Banner Playing]
[Bullet The Blue Sky Begins] ln the howling wind
Comes a stinging rain
See it driving nails lnto the souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly
Red-orange glow l see the face of fear
Running scared in the valley below
Sky
Whoo
Sky...
Whoo
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue ln the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
See them burning crosses
See the flames, higher and higher
Sky
Whoo
Sky...
Whoo
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue
Yeah
All right... now it's you.
So this guy comes up to me
His face red, like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colors of a royal flush
And he's peeling off those dollar bills
Slapping 'em down
And l can see those fighter planes l can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the valleys and the quiet city streets
We take the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
A man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls, we hear the city groan
Outside, it's America
Outside, it's America
So back in the hotel room
With John Coltrane and the Love Supreme ln the next room, l hear some woman scream out
That her lover is turning off
Turning on the television
Well, l can't tell the difference
Between ABC News,
Hill Street Blues
And the preacher of the Old Time Gospel Hour
Stealing money from the sick and the old
Well, the god l believe in lsn't short of cash, mister l feel a long way
From the hills of San Salvador
Where the sky is ripped open
And the rain pours through a gaping wound
Pelting the women and children
Pelting the women and children
Who run...who run... lnto the arms...
Of America
[Crowd Cheering]
[Running To Stand Still Begins]
And so she woke up
She woke up from where she was lying still
Said l--l gotta do something
About where l'm going
Step on a steam train
Step out of the driving rain
Maybe run from the darkness in the night
Singing ha, ha la la la de day
Ha la la la de day
Ha la la de day
Mmm
Sweet the sin
But bitter the taste in my mouth l see seven towers
But l only see one way out
You got to cry without weeping
Talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know, l took the poison
From the poison stream
Then l floated out of here
Singing ha, ha la la la de day
Ha la la la de day
Ha la la de day
Oh...ooh
Ooh, oh
She runs through the streets
With her eyes painted red
Under black belly of cloud in the rain ln through a doorway she brings me
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea
She is raging, she is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand...
Still l'm still running
Still running
Still running, yeah l'm still running
[Audience]
Still running

Still running

Still running
Still running
Still running l'm still running

[Playing Harmonica]
[Crowd Cheering] l don't-- l'm not even sure that that song should be in the film--
Sunday
Bloody Sunday-- because l-- you know, that day, the day of the Enniskillen, uh...bombing, you know, will soon long since be forgotten, and people will not understand the way we felt onstage.
[Crowd Cheering]
Well, here we are, the lrish in America.
[Crowd Cheering]
The lrish have been coming to America for years... going back to the great famine when the lrish were on the run from starvation... and the British government that couldn't care less... right up to today.
You know, there are more lrish immigrants here in America today than ever-- some illegal, some legal.
A lot of them are just running from high unemployment.
Some run from the troubles in Northern lreland, from the hatred of the H-blocks, the torture-- others from wild acts of terrorism like we had today in a town called Enniskillen, where 11 people lie dead, many more injured, on a Sunday, bloody Sunday.
[Sunday Bloody Sunday Begins]
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh l can't believe the news today l can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
Tonight
We can be as one
Tonight
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across a dead-end street
But l won't heed the battle call
That puts my back up, my back up against the wall
Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday
And this battle's yet begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
Trenches dug within our hearts
Mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart
Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
Tonight
We can be as one
Tonight

Oh!
[Bono]
Yeah
Yeah
And let me tell you something. l've had enough of lrish-Americans who haven't been back to their country in 20 or 30 years come up to me and talk about the resistance, the revolution back home... and the glory of the revolution and the glory of dying for the revolution.
Fuck the revolution!
[Crowd Cheering]
They don't talk about the glory of killing for the revolution.
What's the glory... in taking a man from his bed and gunning him down in front of his wife and his children?
Where's the glory in that?
Where's the glory in bombing a remembrance day parade of old-age pensioners, their medals taken out and polished up for the day?
Where's the glory in that?
To leave them dying or crippled for life or dead under the rubble... of a revolution... that the majority of the people in my country don't want?
No more! Sing!
[Audience]
No more
No more
No more
No more

Good night.
God bless you.
You say you want
A diamond and a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold
But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all l want is you
You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the land
You say you'll give me
Eyes in a moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbor in the tempest
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all l want is you
You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
You say you want
Diamonds and a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold
Oh, the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all l want is you
You l want is you
All l want is you
All l want is you
You know, if this is your documentary, you're doing a bad job.
'Cause you're catching me when I don't want to talk about things.
Set it up, organize a time with me.
Put together some materials, e-mails, we'll get the Facebook conversation printed out, and we'll really talk about it.
But do you want to be the subject of this documentary or not?
No, I don't.
This is about Abby.
Do you want to be the co-subject?
No, I don't see why. I don't think I'm that interesting.
I'm making a documentary about Abby through you.
Can you understand that?
What do you think? I'm going to talk to Abby right now?
No, I understand.
I'm just saying.
This is an e-mail from Abby that I got today.
"My snake Zoe died today. "
I didn't even know she had a snake.
"I kind of thought she was sick since Sunday,
"and this morning she was almost dead.
"By the time I got back from school, she was really dead.
"She didn't eat her last meal, so now I have a pet mouse named Max.
"He's super cute. "
I thought that was really funny.
Such a positive way of looking at things, you know?
One pet for the next.
Circle of life.
Yeah.
By the light.
You ready? Sound levels? Everything?
Yeah.
Okay. Today is April 9th,
2008, and I'm about to open...
I think the third or fourth box, package, that Angela,
Abby's mom, has sent me.
Let's see what we got.
I'm excited.
What are you expecting?
I mean,
I know there's a couple...
A couple of pastel drawings that I really like, that I've seen already.
But I think there's also some pictures or paintings that I haven't seen.
Let's open this T-shirt first.
This is her brother's band.
"To Rel. ' '
Oh, this is for Rel.
A little card. Do you want to open it, Rel, or should I open it?
No, you can open it.
From Abby.
Go ahead and read it.
I got to open it.
The card.
I guess this is her brother's band. The Casualties.
"To Nev. Make sure Rel wears a brain bucket when he skateboards. "
"He scares me a little.
Peace and love, Abby. "
So, wear your brain bucket. All right, now let's look at these paintings.
What's the most one of
Abby's paintings has sold for?
She sounds really nice, and just normal, which is a relief, because the first time we spoke it was just about a package and it was short.
But...
Yeah, I mean, she's got, like, a lot of kids running around.
Her son was plowing. They had, like, a foot of snow yesterday, and he knocked over a power line that knocked into a tree.
So, they had to cut down this, like, 150-year-old maple tree.
He burnt the transmission out on the car. They didn't have power.
Phones that were plugged in got surged and fried.
And she's, like, you know, dealing with it.
She must be awesome 'cause her kids are pretty awesome, at least from Facebook.
The Facebook family, that's what we'll call them.
Her sister Megan is an artist, and also a dancer, but she isn't making as much art...
Or only shared this picture with me, because I think she has a big crush on me.
So when I put that... Made that my Facebook profile picture,
she really liked it and told me how nice it was,
and that she thought how nice it would be to put her head on my chest and fall asleep.
So then she drew it, and it's actually a beautiful drawing.
Yeah, it is.
It's really good.
She works as a vet, so she likes animals a lot.
I like animals. I'm not a crazy animal lover, but I do like animals.
She's a musician.
I think she plays the cello,
maybe also the guitar, and she sings.
I'm not really a musician, but I guess you could say that we have a similarity there.
'Cause I... Whatever.
She's a dancer.
She takes ballet, other... I think she does belly dancing.
Again, not that I do either of those, but dance is a big part of my life.
I mean...
I guess I don't know that much about her yet.
Hey, Megan?
Hey, it's Nev.
Your voice is not at all what I expected.
No, no... It's... It's...
Really, it's a terrific voice, I just...
I don't know, I guess you never really think of a voice when you only know somebody in a certain way.
I happen to think my voice is sort of irritating.
Thank you.
So, if you're home now, does that mean you're, like, at home with your mom and Abby and the whole family?
She's there, and she wants to know who you're talking to?
Well, you should tell her.
I've spoken to your mom.
New package from Michigan.
Really big, 35 pounds.
And I'm going to check it out.
I'm really excited.
I was told that they had used paper towels to pack.
Now we've got not some, but tons of paper towels.
What's the reason for this new package?
Just new paintings. I don't know. Let's see what we got.
Here we go. This is cool.
This is the painting of Angela that she did, which is actually really good.
That's the mom?
Yeah.
Now?
Yeah.
Wow.
I know.
She's hot.
She is very attractive.
You know what I just learned?
That Abby puts a strand of her hair in every oil painting that she does because she wants to be able to prove that it's hers by DNA.
Like, whenever, down the line.
She also spits in her watercolors.
These are the prints.
How many of them?
Here's the original.
This is... Jesus.
Well, they're making money from them.
They sold all the art, they sold out.
To local collectors.
A lot of paper towels.
All right, amazing package.
Okay, I'll be back.
What do you think?
It's okay. I like it.
Megan's singing backup vocals.
This is a really cinematic...
I mean, that's a no-brainer, right?
I'm not sure who posted it, but Alex sent me a message.
"Why? I have no idea. I doubt you'll appreciate it one bit. ' '
Jeez.
I know.
And now, this is interesting.
I don't know what this is about, but I just see that Angela, the mom, wrote on Alex's wall,
"You really need to stay out of it, please. ' '
Now, I don't know, that could be in reference to something else, but I feel like that's probably in reference to...
I mentioned to Megan that he had sent me a message.
Last night we had a great talk. She told me about...
Did you guys know this? Chickens.
She has six chickens now.
Her neighbor gave them to her as a house-warming present.
A chicken makes an egg every day. Did you know that? Every day.
Like ovulating.
They ovulate eggs.
Yeah.
Crazy.
Every day?
Every day a chicken makes one egg.
She has chickens?
She now has chickens.
Tell us the gifts she got.
So, she bought a house, and one of the presents was that Abby got her a baby goat.
So she's got a goat now. She has horses that live there.
Part of buying the house came with these horses that are held there,
you know, like stables.
I can't.
Nothing.
You don't want this.
I'm pretty good.
I'm good.
I'm sure he is.
Bye.
How long have you been calling each other "babe"?
A couple of weeks.
Two weeks maybe.
So you're full-on going out? This is a long distance relationship?
No, we're not. We're not.
But, you know, if we met each other and the attraction exists in real life, it would be, like, instantaneous relationship.
But you can't just make out and send her home.
I know.
And take her virginity.
Well, that's what it comes down to.
I'm going to have to really be very careful.
Because even if there is a lot of chemistry, she does still live in Michigan.
"Megan, this is the first letter I have sent you, ever.
"It feels a little strange since all of our communications
"have been virtual up until now.
"I made two of these pennies, one for you and one for me.
"You have no idea how excited I am to meet you.
"Yours, Nev. "
Message.
Hey, Megan.
Nev, 6:00, Sunday.
Yeah, I guess you just got kicked off G-Chat.
I'm leaving tomorrow for Vail.
I don't know what your schedule is like for the next two weeks, but Rel, Henry, and I are going to be out there till the 9th
for the Vail
Dance Festival, so...
I don't know, maybe you and your mom and Abby and Joelle
should come out for a weekend.
You're like, kind of, halfway there.
Fly to Denver. I don't know, it's an idea.
So, you can call me at the office or on my cell.
Would love to talk to you before I leave tonight, bye.
Flight attendants prepare for landing, please.
Careful, watch the heads.
Okay, and we both roll...
So, you have to sit between...
All right, I'm rolling on my two cameras. All right, rolling.
Megan's taking requests and she'll record a song right now.
Wild Horses?
Silver Stallion?
Any other horse songs we can think of?
Tennessee Stud?
She's typing.
"I think I can handle that. ' '
I hope she sings.
That's good.
That's really good.
She's so hot.
Can we request some more songs?
This is fun. You can just request paintings for Abby to do and songs for
Megan to sing.
That was pretty good.
That was really good.
That was good.
She just did that.
So, on Angela's website, on her Facebook, does she have all her songs up?
She's got a bunch of them.
Like a published artist?
Like a musician?
This one's sick, but it's the other one.
Tell her how much we like the other song, where she plays guitar.
And the other one, I can't remember what it's called.
Huh.
That's not good.
Search.
Sort of sounds like it, a little different though.
It's really similar, though.
It's not as good.
Angela's is better.
Yes.
All right, listen, you can't hold it against her.
She didn't say,
"Hey, I wrote this song. ' '
It doesn't matter, she's still... Yeah. Yeah.
And still, her voice is 10 times better than this girl.
And she's clearly an artist because that came from deep expression and feeling.
She found a song, kind of obscure... She covered a song.
Yeah. People make careers out of that.
So, you're just playing this off Facebook?
No, I'm not,
I'm playing this off... Look.
Amy Kuney.
This is it.
I have food in my mouth.
I mean, is this not the exact same recording?
I'm not sure.
Sounds a little different.
Definitely it.
They posted it online.
I know.
She posted somebody else's music.
Did she post it...
Now, that doesn't mean she doesn't just put up a song that she likes. Fine.
But it's called... The artists are "Mom and Megan. ' '
And I complimented her and she said,
"Thanks for listening to me cough the dust off my vocal cords. ' '
She responded to a number of compliments that I gave her about the song and how much I liked it, and it's not even her singing.
It's just a recording of somebody else's song.
Are we sure about that?
Yes.
Sounds a lot like that other girl, doesn't it?
What's her name?
Yeah, come on.
What, "come on"?
You think that's Megan?
I don't know.
I don't know. I mean, I would have never second-guessed it, but...
But where did she find a cover of Tennessee Stud in half an hour?
Wait. Who is that?
Oh, my God!
What?
Is this it?
Yes!
No, no, no. Play yours, play yours. This is it!
Play yours! Play yours.
This is it, Rel.
I'm 100%.
Let me hear yours.
It's the same song, Rel.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
They are complete psychopaths.
They are complete psychopaths.
I've probably been chatting with a guy this whole time.
Oh, my God!
Just to ask her to explain what's going on.
Say, "Have you listened to the two?"
I mean, that is enough for me to just never, ever talk to them again.
Why should I waste time with this?
I mean, if she's going to try and tell me that that's not the same song...
All I'm saying is, if you come off too angry, then they can pretend that they cut off the relationship with you because you freak out.
Yeah, I'm freaking out.
They've been lying to...
You don't know that.
Don't you want to get to the bottom of this?
It would kill me if it was left like this.
I can't now, it's too late. It's all bullshit.
I don't want to be a part of this.
We don't know how much of it is bullshit.
And they don't know how much of it you know is bullshit.
You've just found, like, the tip of the iceberg.
I mean, I talked to somebody on the phone, two different people.
You never talked to Abby?
No. Which is also weird, 'cause every time I've called, it's been like,
"She just went to sleep," or,
"Let me see if I can wake her up.
"She's too tired. ' '
Are there, like, newspaper articles about Abby having a show?
No. No one's ever googled Abby, still.
I did. Her name's
Abigail. But she had...
They claim that she has shows and she sells her paintings.
She just had her gallery...
A big show tonight of all the paintings she's done of Megan.
Wouldn't this get written up somewhere? Yeah, maybe, actually.
Is this how your spell her name, A-B-B-Y? Yeah.
Michigan?
Mmm-hmm.
There's nothing on Abby, anywhere.
What's Ishpeming?
City of Ishpeming.
Yeah, let's start with that.
Ishpeming.
Do you know where Abby was showing her paintings?
At her gallery.
What is that gallery?
It doesn't have a name yet.
I can give you the address.
It's a gallery that she...
She bought the building.
Oh.
What's the address?
I could tell you.
Tell me.
It's just a building.
It's probably a real address.
Let's Google map it.
Check it out.
I found the building in my e-mail.
I searched for
"Abby gallery building," and I found the link she sent me. It was $30,000.
Wow. On the corner...
It's on North Main.
Wait a second. "Listings last updated August 4th. ' '
It's still listed.
I should probably call and see if it's still for sale.
Yes.
Yes.
So, I was calling about that space you have,
I think it's
100 Main Street.
Right, the old JCPenny.
They just completely fabricated the entire renovation.
How long has it been empty?
Four years.
Hello?
Hey, Angela.
Nothing, just with
Rel and Henry here, we're getting ready to head over to go film some dance.
Okay.
Sounded like the gallery opening was a success.
Just a liar. How could she just lie to me like that?
I can't believe
I believed her.
I can't believe I was so gullible. I'm so embarrassed.
There it is. Here it is.
Hello?
Hi.
Hi, Nev.
Abby.
Hey, how are you?
Good.
Happy birthday.
I got a Katie doll for my birthday.
What? I can't hear you so good.
So what are you doing?
You having a big sleepover?
What did you say?
She has people here, so... It's
Angela. I'm sorry, bad time to call.
But I didn't want to have her put you up too much longer.
Is there a time that we can call back later?
I'm just saying... Moving forward. I'm just keeping a record.
Fine. Moving forward.
It takes two seconds.
I'm a little more involved with this than I'd like to be now.
And it's, like, becoming kind of a chore, so just let me do my thing.
No, it's not. Yeah, except it's not your life.
Yeah, that's why it gets a little frustrating, when I have to go back...
I'm just saying. I'm sorry, I guess I was a little pissy, but...
Try to be a little more understanding to the fact that
You can stop, Nev.
So stop right now.
Just stop.
Yeah, so what are you giving me? Basic laziness?
I'm directing you in a film.
All I'm saying is, please appreciate that.
You signed up for a film that is 24 hours a day.
I don't know. What's the next move? Does anyone have any idea?
Yeah.
What?
I think we finish up with
Vail, then we drive to Michigan.
Okay.
And we just find out.
We just go to their house, and just say, "Hi. Who's real in this situation?
"I want to meet Abby. ' '
I've chatted on the Internet with a couple of people.
I know my friend, she actually just met a guy the other day off the Internet and he was a total weirdo.
They met up and, like, he was just like...
I guess the pictures that they were sending each other were from, like, three years ago.
So he didn't even look the same, and he was just, like, piercings everywhere.
Like, the whole nine yards.
She was like, "Oh, my gosh. ' '
Yeah, we're closing in on the state of Michigan.
Bye.
Bye.
Megan is at her house in Gladstone.
Apparently one of her horses, which I knew, is in labor.
One of the horses that lives at the farm. So, she's got to stay there.
But every Sunday is family breakfast at Angela's house.
I forgot about that.
What time is family breakfast?
She said around 8:00.
What?
On Sunday?
I know.
Isn't that the day of rest?
I think we should just get up really early, go by the farm, and, depending on what happens, then drive up to
Ishpeming and crash family breakfast. Bring some OJ and just show up.
Wow, we're three miles...
We're three miles from a turn that would then take us another few miles to Megan's farm.
I'd just like to do a drive-by.
Yeah, I think we should totally cruise by.
I mean, we're here. I don't want to just get here and go to sleep.
Let's kick some dust up.
Yeah.
2.9 miles.
So that's her, right?
Yeah.
That means we just take a really quick left and we're there.
I feel like we're about to get our SAT scores back.
Here we are.
Megan's street.
This is it, huh?
You gonna turn off the light?
No, we're not there yet.
What's the name of the street?
I think it's 21st...
It's right here.
I have no idea.
I think it's this.
There's something.
This could be it.
This is it. I think this is it. This is it, this is it.
What do you mean, she said there was a light?
She said that because one of the horses was giving birth.
Just pull up. I'm not afraid. What?
You want to drive into the driveway? Yeah.
There's a mailbox.
Pull up to the mailbox, so I can get it from my window.
Please, please, please.
Yes! Yes! The postcards are here! Oh, my God.
"Return to this address for proper disposition. ' '
Pull into the driveway.
Back up, go into the driveway.
It shouldn't give you the creeps.
We're in, like, a beautiful part of the country, a horse farm. No, no, no. Pull in forward.
What?
What, are you crazy, Henry?
What do you mean?
Drive into the driveway.
What do you mean? Don't back into the driveway.
Don't back into it.
Why not?
Because then we can't see what's in front of us.
Okay.
It's definitely a horse farm.
Okay.
Keep going. Keep going.
Do we want to... You can pull out on the other side.
I'm gonna drive through. Yeah.
This all looks familiar.
Probably just from the photos.
Stop, stop, stop.
We can't get out that way.
Just turn around.
It's all right.
That's an empty...
Let me just go in, let me just go look in the window and make sure there are no horses there. Come on out. Let's go.
Yeah, it's empty.
No horses.
You can't see anything.
Okay, so we know that
Megan doesn't live here.
What surprises me the most is that to go to the trouble to lie as elaborately as they have, for her to not just drive here and pick up the mail seems crazy, doesn't it?
Like, we just drove 400 miles and picked up the mail.
All she had to do was drive 50.
How could she be so lazy?
Didn't you...
I mean, so lazy they fooled you for eight months.
That's pretty good.
They didn't fool me, they just told me things
I never cared to question.
Right.
That's not fooling.
That's not like...
I mean...
I just can't believe I talked to this person and told her things and had real conversations with her about life and, you know, feelings.
There were moments where
I really felt genuine...
Like I really cared about this girl.
Now I don't know even what to feel.
Should I read you the juicy stuff from our text conversation, now that we're about to meet her?
I think it's time, right?
Yeah.
You got the battery for it?
Absolutely.
Is the light okay?
Is it a good shot?
Yeah.
You're retainer is in.
I gotta scroll way up.
Okay. July 3rd, 4:33 p. m.
Megan,
"I will do that.
Abby's so excited today.
"I'm at the home now, baking pies.
"They'll be over here later.
"I wish you were here,
I hope your day is beautiful. ' '
Me, "Save a pie for me. ' '
The next day.
"Hey, babe, I couldn't understand a word you said on the VM you just left me.
"I just kicked everyone out and now
"I'm in the bathtub, thinking of you. ' '
"Funny, I was thinking about you in the shower earlier. ' '
Megan, "Mmm, I'd love to hear about that.
"By the way, I will always have a pie for you, babe. ' '
Me, "Cherry?"
Space, space, space, space.
"I can't believe I just wrote that, sorry. I had to. ' '
Megan, "Cherry. My body is craving your touch tonight. ' '
Me, "What exactly would you do if you had me there?"
Megan, "I'd have you in the tub with me, between my legs.
"I'd kiss you on the neck and whisper in your ear,
"begging you to make love to me. ' '
Me,
"Begging isn't something you would need to do.
"In fact, I'm willing to bet that, if anything,
"you might have to beg me to stop. ' '
Megan,
"I'd take you to my room and dry you off, touching every inch of you,
"kissing your long... ' ' Wait, sorry. "Kissing you long and hard,
"to take your breath away. ' '
Nev.
I can't believe I wrote this. "I can't wait to fill my fingers with your hair,
"and turn your back to me, pulling you up against me,
"and running my tongue all the way up your neck,
"biting your ears as I fill my hands with your breasts. ' '
That sounds like a bad porno book, doesn't it?
"But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
"Taking it slow, though difficult,
"will be very important for us if this is really going to happen. ' '
Wait, is this still you? Me.
Megan, "I want you so badly my body aches for you. ' '
Nev, "Fifteen days and I'm all yours. ' '
Megan, "I don't understand the hold you have on my heart.
"There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you, babe. ' '
Nev, "I'm going to hold you to that.
"Get some sleep.
Big day tomorrow.
"Happy Fourth. Yay freedom. ' '
Megan, "Sweet dreams of me. I'll be dreaming of you. I adore you. ' '
Nev, "Good night, sugar. ' '
There it is.
Can't see anything, right?
No.
You think you could feel it?
If they hug you?
Hi! No.
Nothing, right?
No.
Where is it? Right in the small of my chest.
You got to hold the mic thing in, or else you won't hear it, Henry.
You got to push the headphones in.
I can hear you!
Really?
Okay. So it sounds pretty good?
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
You can hear me good?
Totally clear.
We are close.
We are in the town of Ishpeming, and I think it's just maybe one more turn and then we're on Main Street.
Then there it is, the house.
No one's going to notice us.
Just be cool.
This looks like it's the old
JCPenny, right here. This is it.
This is the old JCPenny building. Right here.
Definitely not a gallery.
Nice dream, though.
Keep it a little more subtle, guys. Jesus Christ.
I think this is... That could be it, right there.
North Main Street. That was it, right there on the corner.
We're in plain sight right now.
Make sure your cell phone is on.
I'm gonna leave the car running.
Yeah.
And the doors open.
Let's get the seats ready to jump into.
And have the windows open, maybe even, too.
It might be that kind of escape.
Rel, you ready? Let's not waste any time. We got to go.
Hello?
No. Just stay strong.
Stay strong.
Hello?
Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
Angela?
Yes.
Yaniv.
Hi, nice to see you.
How are you?
Good to see you.
Abby's not here.
We thought we'd surprise you.
We got you some flowers...
Oh, my goodness.
Abby's not here.
...and some presents for...
Hi, how are you?
Good. How are you?
I'm Ariel.
What are you guys doing up here?
We were flying through Chicago and figured, since Abby couldn't come and it was her birthday, we would just drive on up and surprise her.
You guys are so wonderful.
Here, this is for you.
That one, right there.
Well, thank you, thank you very much.
Yeah.
What's your name?
My name is Vince.
Hey. Ariel.
Hi.
Hi. How are you?
How nice to see you.
Hi, nice to see you.
You guys shouldn't have come.
Oh, my goodness.
We were close-ish.
Wow.
So, this is a really nice thing here for Abby.
Get down, Spot.
Thank you.
Would you like to come in?
Sure.
Let me deal with this dog.
He's vicious.
I can't believe you guys came.
That's so sweet.
It's our pleasure. You guys are such a nice family, we were excited to meet you and kept missing opportunities.
You guys shouldn't have come.
You guys need to be working.
You know, we thought it would be a fun road trip.
This is for your dog.
This is for the dog.
A little dog toy.
Oh. That's so sweet.
I have something here for Megan, too.
Is she in town?
Come on in.
Come on in.
Your house is beautiful.
Thank you. And this town is really lovely.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys.
Where did you get these?
We just picked them on the road.
Howdy.
What's happening?
We tried to find a flower shop, but we couldn't.
Hey, man, I'm Ariel.
Hey, guys.
Okay.
So... Wow.
So, where you guys staying tonight?
Actually, we hadn't figured that out.
We figured we'd find a motel or something.
Hey.
Come on in.
They're not... I don't even know where to start.
Angela doesn't look like Angela.
Vince doesn't look like Vince.
And there's a painting in process.
Yeah.
I promise.
It's like a blown-out...
It's like blown-out sun. Why?
You going to cut your hair?
Oh, no. When?
What kind of...
You have cancer?
Oh, man, that sucks.
I'm really sorry to hear it.
Wait for a little gust of wind, and we'll get your hair in the air.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey! What?
At first,
Abby was freaking out.
And then she put her friend
Lauren on the phone...
We're just going to go meet her.
Let's just keep playing it really cool.
I'm gonna put this in here.
But don't you think it would just be better that we have our car with us? Yes.
So, let's take our car.
Henry, you want to follow?
I mean, you want me to leave you in there?
You need to chill out a little bit.
Yeah, I think right now, yes, things are a definitely weird, but I'm not...
Yeah.
I don't feel threatened at all.
I don't think there's any feeling of hers that's like, "Oh, my God.
We have to attack. ' '
Like, she seems she's on the defensive.
No,
I don't want to attack.
Just trying to stay back.
Let's just roll, Rel. If we don't get into this experience, there's no reason to be here.
Let's ride with them.
US National Ski Hall of Fame? Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah, sure.
This is Lauren's dad's house.
Beach house.
Hi!
Hey.
What are you guys doing?
Nothing?
You going to say hi?
Abby.
Hi. We've never met. I'm Yaniv.
Nice to meet you.
Give me a hug.
What's happening? I'm Ariel. My brother.
Hey, I'm Ariel.
Hi.
Yaniv.
Are you nervous? No?
Nev is.
He's nervous.
You're like... You're like a famous painter, you know?
I'm so excited to meet you.
You guys want to go out?
Okay.
Let's go.
Abby, she doesn't really paint. Her mom paints a lot, but Abby doesn't paint that much.
Huh. What about her sister Megan?
Hey, Abby, do you see your older sister Megan?
Oh, really?
Where does she live?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Well, there's the confession.
Heard it pretty clearly from Abby's friend.
She'd never seen
Megan before, doesn't know where she lives, doesn't get to talk to her, and doesn't really paint that much.
Well, we're going to see you for dinner.
Well, she's here now, so it wouldn't do us any good anyway. So we'll go, we'll change, we'll shower, then we'll meet up with you and we'll get a chance to hang out. Okay.
Okay. Maybe you guys can come back to the house and hang out.
Okay... Cool. I will speak to you soon.
All right.
Thanks again.
So...
What do you guys think?
Hold it or it will fall.
Angela's in love with you.
Angela is in love with me.
Right.
Yeah.
You can see it. Did you see how awkward it was when I was going to leave and she was leaning on the car?
She doesn't think we're coming back. Right.
Of course she doesn't think we're coming back.
She's like, "Don't go. ' '
No, no.
Most people wouldn't go back.
So, I'm 90% sure right now that
Angela is the voice of Megan.
Yeah.
And that I've been texting and having this weird affair with this strange
40-year-old woman.
Right?
Because her voice is very similar. Mmm-hmm.
It's just like a little bit...
Slow, tired.
Right.
If she just slowed it down and softened it, it'd be the same voice.
And of course we can't get her on the phone because she's standing right...
You know, it's her.
Right.
But she... She'd have to have two cell phones, which I think she does.
Megan called you,
right, while we were with Angela?
Yeah, but no one was there.
I think she may have just dialed it.
She was there on the beach, and she may have just...
I was kind of looking at her.
I also texted her, and then shortly thereafter Angela, like, looked at her phone.
You want to hear my theory?
Megan in the pictures, Angela doesn't know that person.
No, right.
She just somehow found a trove of pictures of this girl...
Right... who's, like, an amateur model.
But she does have a 19-year-old daughter, or an older daughter. Right?
Right. And she just found in these pictures,
this photo of an another woman who kind of looks like her.
Who's not even a woman, who's just a girl.
That woman doesn't look like her.
Who's a girl, and just labeled her.
Let's just say,
I could take...
You know, I could take all of your photos, and all of your photos...
And download them? Download them, and make new profiles
with totally different names, and never make friends
with people who knew you.
And just create a network of friends
that are actually real-life friends, but you don't know them.
I mean, there's a lot that...
Where do you find those?
...that still doesn't explain, guys. No, it doesn't explain...
I mean, also, what I want to know is,
what about the rest of these people?
What about
Ryan Iverson and Tim?
If Picture Megan doesn't know Abby, right, and Abby doesn't know Megan.
Right, maybe these other kids don't.
Then, these other kids, they talk about Abby, too, right?
They all talk about Abby.
Then they don't know Abby.
Their friend Megan doesn't know Abby. Right. Her sister.
But Alex has got to be fake, if Megan's fake.
They all relate to you through Megan.
If there's no Megan, then they don't relate to you.
'Cause she's not fooling them, too.
I mean, maybe she's...
What about all these other people?
She's all of them.
She could be all of them.
Right.
I'm feeling very conscious about, like, embarrassing her, and not... Right.
Like, I really don't want to hurt this family.
You know?
Well, she needs a wake-up call.
I know, but I just feel like it's just not...
It's not malicious.
It's just sad.
Right. No, we're not here to be...
You know?
Listen, I think she...
We're not here to hurt her, we're here to help.
We deserve to shake the truth out of her.
Right. For our sake, for Nev's sake.
I think that what we should do while we're here is Nev should gently confront her about this.
I don't think it should be,
"You effing liar!"
Megan Faccio. "Are you seriously at my mom's?
"Stay there, I'm coming home. ' ' Exclamation point.
Why wouldn't she call me?
No, I mean as far as the paint.
Do you like oil pastels?
Bye.
Bye. Thank you, guys.
All right, catch up with you guys later.
Okay, so apparently while we slept, somebody decided that it was time to tell the truth.
Now, here's two texts that I woke up to from Megan Faccio.
"By now you know my mom is very ill.
"And I can't continue to do this to her, and neither can Alex. ' '
And then, check out this message from Ryan Iverson on Facebook.
"I need to tell you that the reason I came down here
"was not to bring Megan home, as Angela requested.
"I'm taking her,
Alex, and Ben to
"Dawn Farms for inpatient treatment. ' '
I mean, she did it...
That's a really smart play, that Megan's an alcoholic.
Even though I knew she drank, all of a sudden she went into rehab.
Right, it's really smart.
And Alex. And that's why they went downstate.
You know? And that's why Ryan went, 'cause he went to take them.
And...
Yeah, well, we're going to get her to just tell us the truth.
I think that at some point today, we should probably have, you know, a real talk.
Okay. You know, a good sit-down conversation.
To sort of go over a couple of things, and clear some stuff up.
Okay.
And I guess you understand the necessity on our part to sort of just show up.
Yeah.
Because making arrangement obviously wasn't working out.
No, it wasn't.
And there didn't really seem to be any way to get everybody in the same place.
But I would like to just, sort of, meet Angela.
See what she has to say.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Nothing to be upset about.
You got a great imagination.
You know?
Yeah.
It's pretty remarkable.
But you can imagine now, at this point, we've put most of it together.
Not everything, but pretty much everything.
We know there's no Tim, we know probably there isn't any of these people, really.
My daughter.
There is Megan.
There is a Megan?
There is a Megan.
But she's not around.
She's not around.
All right. What is she, 19? She's 19.
Where does she live?
She lives downstate and she's in Dawn Farms. That's true.
Wow, for how long has she been there?
She's been there for about four months now, so...
But I never spoke to her.
No.
Right.
No.
I feel terrible.
And who's the girl in the pictures?
Just...
That's a family friend.
So, I feel like
I've betrayed her.
We'll see you later. We'll see you in two weeks, Abby.
Where did my mom go?
I think she and Nev are out, hanging out.
Well, Vince is already at the house, watching the boys for me.
And does Vince know all about this?
Smile with a little teeth.
Smile with a little teeth.
You have nice teeth.
Beautiful teeth.
Oh, golly.
Megan. Ryan.
Then Ryan had two sisters.
Amy and Sara-Ann, who is a girl here in town, also.
One of Joelle's friends. That's how I get pictures of them together.
Josh is Joelle's brother, and... Right.
In real life, no.
You're talking about...
Yeah, in real life, also.
And Alex, and Tim, and Sophia, and I think that's it. Sophia.
That's it. I think.
No. Then Nick and...
Oh, yeah.
Gotta have those guys.
Had to have some cousins
Just to make life interesting, if ever I was getting a little bored.
How do you keep track of what everyone was doing?
Luckily, it was on Facebook, and I could go back and re-read who was doing what.
Because I didn't hardly ever delete anything.
And I guess, in the back of my mind, I knew that this would happen.
I think when Megan said something about it,
I was like, "Okay, just leave everything up. ' '
Because at one point I was going to start taking things off, and I was like,
"Maybe I'll just
"set some things where they're private," but everything is still on the Facebook accounts.
Kind of had a feeling that you guys would maybe do something with this.
I don't think so. I'm not really sure I want to be now, but I'm going with it because I feel like I owe it to you. I really do.
You have such a beautiful smile.
I keep changing your smile, because you keep changing your smile.
But it's beautiful.
Can you show me some of your things?
Well, my mom painted that painting.
That's done by my mom.
My mom did that.
Do you like that painting?
Yeah.
I think I can see City Hall from right here. Let me just get on my bed.
I think I stepped on one of my bears while they were sleeping.
I knew it was you.
I'm not a bear!
I'm a bunny.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Uh...
Don't know.
Hey, baby.
I know what's wrong.
You want your television back on?
You not happy today?
You took your shirt off.
You have to strap this down to the floor, because he was tipping himself over in the chair.
We just got this new wheelchair, and it has too high of a center of gravity.
What?
My arm doesn't bend that way, baby.
You're going to have to stay there for a little bit longer, honey.
All of his medications also go through his G-Tube.
This one's Risperdal, and this helps with his self-abusive behavior.
It helps to calm him down, keep him from hurting himself.
Why do you think that he does that?
It's self-stimulating.
It's just really, really retarded. I don't know how else to tell you.
Hi, Anthony. Luckily Anthony doesn't sneak up on you.
He gives you a little warning.
So you have to shave him and everything? Everything.
They're in diapers. They're just totally dependent.
He's going to bludgeon me to death with the pan here if I don't get up and do something.
Sauce.
Yeah, I mean, she's got, like, a lot of kids running around.
Her son was plowing.
He knocked over a power line that knocked into a tree.
So, they had to cut down this, like, 150-year-old maple tree.
She's, like, you know, dealing with it.
She must be awesome 'cause her kids are pretty awesome, at least from Facebook.
Hey!
No fair!
Hey, Megan?
Hey, it's Nev.
Your voice is not at all what I expected.
Wait, that was a bad...
Another bad joke.
But you don't even stop to tell me that it's a bad joke.
You just ignore it.
She's got a really nice voice, right?
Like soft and...
Mature, very mature voice.
It's hard to say anything until we meet, and then... Whatever.
I don't know. I guess I could agree to not get involved, which is probably what I should do.
Why would Angela want you to agree to that?
Because I don't feel like, realistically, there's any way that
Megan and I can go out, or be together, without her getting hurt.
I'm not getting hurt.
This is how I typically spend from 11:00 on, every evening, seeing who would call.
So, which one is which?
This is 1211, that's the phone number that was for Megan.
And this is 0580, and that was mine.
Your home phone.
This is...
The home phone is there.
Add that, too. So, we'd use that occasionally also.
What if
Vince picked up?
He never answers the phone.
I mean, hardly ever.
I have to tell him to answer the phone.
So really not much of a challenge there, with that.
What did she tell you about our relationship, with my photographs?
Well, you are her primary customer.
Right.
Primary.
Very happy with that relationship.
In fact, in a sense, very appreciative of what you have done for her.
Because not only is she a good artist, but it takes somebody that appreciates the art, you know?
I can drive downtown, downstate in Ann Arbor, and see starving artists all over with vanloads of their velvet-painted Elvises.
You know, it ain't going nowhere. And I've told her this.
"You've been given an opportunity of a lifetime.
"Not many people have this. ' '
But really it's... But you told him that I was commissioning.
Yeah.
Every piece.
Yeah.
How much did you tell him
I was paying for them?
It just varied. Whatever came off the top of my head.
And it was part of my problem, too, 'cause I never wrote that down.
So he's like, "How much did you charge for that?"
I'll be like,
"I don't remember. ' '
So, he thinks I'm just terribly forgetful all of a sudden.
I mean, it was an amazing correspondence.
Yeah.
You know?
It was a real, you know, friendship... Yeah.
...that I was also looking for, myself.
And I didn't want to lose the friendship.
And there was times where I felt like I was really overstepping,
and I'd try to pull it back by being like,
"I don't want to lose the friendship. "
Right.
No matter what. I didn't want to lose that, but then I was like,
"If I'm lying, it's not really a friendship anyway. ' '
So, it just got harder.
And I really thought you'd just end up hating me.
You were able to show me things that I don't have access to.
We don't have access to dance like that.
So, it's really been nice.
Dancing was an important part of my life when I was younger,
and I always wanted to be a professional dancer.
I just threw it away, really.
Threw it away to have a good time.
So, a lot of the personalities that came out were just fragments of myself.
Fragments of things I used to be. Wanted to be, never could be.
That's all I ever want to say about that.
You know, when I met the boys, I knew
I was making a sacrifice with my life, but I didn't count the cost of things that I was going to be giving up.
I'm sort of resigning for the rest of my life.
And this year, when I resigned my career,
I don't know, it's like
I gave up a lot of myself.
And I don't know most days who I am.
She did express some maybe suppressed disappointment, in a small way, at not being able to pursue some of the dreams that she may have had growing up.
Did you ever talk about that with her?
Did she ever express that to you?
Yeah, she says things like that to me.
Yes, and then
I remind her, again,
"What is it you want in life?
Because you can't have it all. ' '
And then she comes back, "I want to be with this family.
"I want my house, I want security, and that's what I want. ' '
Then, that's what you shoot for.
Because if there's something else you want, then you need to go looking for that.
I mean, I wanted to ask Angela to speak to me as Megan for a little while.
Oh, gosh. I don't know if I can. I think you can.
Here, you can use this.
That's cool.
I don't know.
It's been a long trip.
Painful?
This has been the hardest drawing I've ever done in my life, for so many reasons.
Well, it better be good.
Better be.
That's that.
Start over.
It's...
What do you want me...
I know what's inside.
What's inside?
What's inside? Why don't we just open it and see?
They used to tank cod from
Alaska all the way to China.
They'd keep them in vats in the ship.
By the time the codfish reached China, the flesh was mush and tasteless.
So this guy came up with the idea that if you put these cods in these big vats, put some catfish in with them, and the catfish will keep the cod agile.
And there are those people who are catfish in life, and they keep you on your toes.
They keep you guessing, they keep you thinking, they keep you fresh.
It's really good.
And I thank God for the catfish, because we'd be droll, boring and dull if we didn't have somebody nipping at our fin.
Don't really feel like it.

ROSIE:
Collbran, Colorado, is really cool, and it's mostly where all the cowboys and cowgirls roam.
We're just country people.
ADAM APPELHANZ: The town of Collbran is a quaint, quiet little town with that honorable
Code of the West type atmosphere.
J' Home J'
PASTOR BOB WILSON:
Close-knit.
Caring.
- And yet, almost desperate.
- J' The leaves have changed J'
J'Atime or two J'
J' Since the last time the train came through J'
- Here, food.
- J' I got my ticket J'
J' And I'm going to go J'
All right, this is my tree house.
This is my table that I built, and this is the carpets that I found in our shed, and so I just put it in here.
And sometimes I sit here when I'm, like, sad or if I'm angry.
If I get a bad, um, grade in one of my classes
'cause I'm not doing really good.
DAWN:
Our home is a two-family unit.
And my daughter lives with us and her family and my husband.
[(109 barks]
DAWN:
You're finding out more and more that the kids come back to the parents and they live and that's about how you make it.
[ Indistinct chatter]
TRISH:
I work at The Cattleman's Grill.
I've never received government assistance, but I went down there...
[sighs deeply]
And I was gonna try to get food stamps.
They turned me away.
My paycheck is about $120 every two weeks.
So it's hard.
[ Indistinct conversation ]
DAWN: My husband, he works for St. Mary's Hospital.
And I'm working now, too, so we're over the limit for help.
We've got seven people in our family, so you make your food stretch.
We've been without vegetables for a while.
We do run out of milk.
We eat dry cereal.
You have to live the best you can.
You've got to make things stretch nowadays.
It's not easy.
ROSIE:
Sometimes we run out of food, so we try to figure out something.
Probably ask friends for food.
We get really hungry, and our tummies just growl, and sometimes
I feel like I'm gonna barf
'cause it feels bad.
But I don't really know what to do.
WOMAN: [singing in church]
J' You alone are my heart's desire J'
J' And I long to worship You J'
WILSON:
The title of the message this morning is "Church and Community."
The church should always be in the community.
And I believe what we're doing is exactly what Jesus would have us do, is exactly what He's doing in the world today.
Jesus was involved in those around Him.
Jesus fed 5,000.
We fed 5,000 here in the not too distant past.
Hunger is an issue in our community.
One of the ways we found that the need is greater than we thought was, on Wednesday nights, we started preparing a meal for anyone who wants to come.
And we had no idea what to expect.
[ Indistinct chatter]
And now we have between 80 and 120 that we'll feed a hot meal to every Wednesday.
So it is a bigger problem that we're aware of.
[ Indistinct chatter]
JANET POPPENDIECK: I think when people hear the term "hunger," they still imagine a skinny, undernourished human being.
They see the pictures of famine victims from sub-Saharan Africa.
That's the image that we carry around.
RAJ PATEL:
If you're comparing hunger in America to hunger of the most grinding kind, then no, I mean, people are not dying of hunger in the same way here that they are in Africa.
But that's about the best that you can say.
It's a problem that people are ashamed of acknowledging.
Our own government is ashamed of acknowledging it from my point of view.
And you just kind of, you know, you're--We're in denial about it, I think.
No.
- [ Smooches ]
- Aww, thank you.
BARBIE IZQUIERDO:
Hunger is right here in the United States.
It could be right next door, and you would never know because people are too afraid to talk about it.
[children chattering ]
- BARBIE: Hold on tight.
- AIDEN: Oh, boom.
Bella, watch your shoe.
Being where I'm from, there's so many expectations of these girls just have kids, drop out, do drugs.
You know, things like that.
I don't want to be that person.
Since August, I lost my job,
I had to get on public assistance to be able to have some type of income coming into the house.
What's that?
- AIDEN: Train.
- BARBIE: A train coming.
My dream is to go to college.
If I go to school, it's an investment in my future, but at the same time,
I'm struggling so much every day to be able to even feed my kids every day.
- Uh-oh.
- [gasps] Wow.
BARBIE: So it's really hard to make that decision now.
Like, I can't tell my kids,
"Okay, I'm going to school,
"so in two years, we're gonna be fine."
I can't tell them,
"Yeah, I'll make sure
"you guys eat in two years."
LALANI: Aiden, come eat.
- Eat it all.
- No.
BARBIE:
Look, you could pick it up.
All my life, I know what it's like to eat Oodles of Noodles, seven days a week, three, four times a day,
'cause it's all we had and cans of Chef Boyardee.
When I had my children,
I said I would never, ever let them taste it just because that was my breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
But life brings you situations and circumstances, and it's up to you to be able to deal with it and find a way to get through it.
A survey from the U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that one in six Americans say they don't have enough to eat.
FEMALE REPORTER: Last year, nearly 30% of U.S. families were classified as "food insecure."
PATEL:
Food insecurity is this idea that you don't know where your next meal is coming from.
You have no idea how you're going to manage to find that food or afford that food.
And when 50 million Americans don't have that power, that's a very dark indication indeed of where we are.
[ Blues guitar music]
Step up on there.
This will make a noise.
Step up on the table right there.
I'll be with you in just a second.
- What grade you in?
- Second.
Second?
You're in the second grade?
- How old are you?
- I'm gonna be eight.
Fixing to be eight.
All right, and you've got asthma?
Okay, do you ever have problems with shortness of breath when you're outside playing or anything?
I have to stop playing and take a deep breath.
DOCTOR: Okay. What did you eat for breakfast this morning?
I didn't eat.
You didn't eat breakfast this morning? Okay.
When you get home in the afternoon, do you eat a snack?
What do you eat?
- Chips.
- Chips? What else, baby?
What do you drink?
- Pop.
- Pop? Oka)!
DOCTOR: Do you have any other snacks besides chips you could eat?
- Huh?
- Cookies.
- Kisses?
- Cookies.
DOCTOR: Cookies.
Cookies and chips, okay.
Maybe you could ask Mom to start buying you some--some carrots and some celery and maybe some apples.
You could slice some apples up.
That'd be good, hmm?
PATEL: A lot of people think there is a yawning gap between hunger on the one hand and obesity on the other.
In fact, they're neighbors.
And the reason that they happen often in the same time and often in the same family and the same person is because they're both signs of having insufficient funds to be able to command food that you need to stay healthy.
[gentle music]
KIMBERLY:
Mostly, I really shop for--
I look around and see what's the cheapest.
You have--Fruit are very high.
And you got chips that's 35¢ a bag.
So I say, "Okay,
I'm not gonna get the fruit.
"I'm gonna get some chips."
But if the fruit on sale,
I'll leave the chips and get the fruit.
She's overweight for her age.
She's very overweight for her age.
So I have to sort of watch, and that bothers me.
Tremon, do you want blue juice or cranberry juice?
TREMONICA: Blue juice.
MARION NESTLE:
If you look at what has happened to the relative price of fresh fruits and vegetables, it's gone up by 40% since 1980 when the obesity epidemic first began.
[The Civil Wars' Long Time Gone]
In contrast, the relative price of processed foods has gone down by about 40%.
So if you have only a limited amount of money to spend, you're going to spend it on the cheapest calories you can get.
And that's going to be processed foods.
This has to do with our farm policy and what we subsidize and what we don't.
J' Look out, Ma, look out, Pa J'
J' Look at that horizon J'
J' Something's out there, kicking up dust J'
J' Storm is coming fast J'
KEN COOK:
The subsidy system that we now have actually started back in the 1930s during the Great Depression.
Farmers were the first to be hit hard when the economy went bad.
There was a lot of pressure to put some sort of government assistance forward to help them get a decent price at harvest time for their crops.
The programs in the Great Depression, of course, were emergency programs.
The idea was, if we could, on a temporary basis, help support the prices of farm products, that we'd get through this difficult period.
And then we would let the market take over, except we never let the market take over.
J' It's been a long time coming J'
COOK: In the 1930s and '40s and into the '50s, and even a little bit beyond that,
I think you could make the case that it really was family farmers who were mostly benefiting from these programs.
But as the agricultural sector became more concentrated in terms of ownership of the land resources, more and more of these operations came to resemble agribusinesses and not family farming operations.
J' It's been J'
J' A long time coming J'
J' It's been J'
J' A long time J'
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, ls one of the most diverse and complex agencies in the entire federal government.
It does everything from international food trade to the Forest Service, to food safety, to animal protection, to, of course, farming programs, and food and nutrition programs.
PATEL:
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has increasingly become the domain of support for mega-farms and mega-farming corporations.
Most of that subsidy money, about 70% of it, has gone just to 10% of those beneficiaries.
The biggest, largest, best capitalized farms, they're hauling in this taxpayer money now.
PATEL: And so there is this weird paradox where welfare for the poor is scorned, but corporate welfare, as it's known, is sort of heartily endorsed.
NESTLE: We subsidize the basic ingredients in processed foods.
We do not subsidize fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, because the producers tend to be small producers.
They don't have the kind of political clout that the big commodity producers of corn and soybeans and wheat that gets processed do.
POPPENDIECK: These subsidies made products very cheap, and therefore made it profitable for the food industry to invest in the infrastructure for processing those products into the packaged goods that we see on every counter, in every corner store, in every vending machine, that are really ubiquitous now and all around us.
REE: Slicin' onions, gets you-- so you know that.
[ Chuckles ]
Just try to be careful.
I'm Ree. I have four boys, and I live in Jonestown, Mississippi.
I've been living in Jonestown all my life.
I'm in the kitchen. [ laughs]
Look, that's funny to her. [ laughs]
[oil sizzling ]
Raw onion, grilled onion.
What I do for work is I cook.
I work the cash register,
I do the dishes.
Mainly, I just pitch in, you know, and help.
We have stores in Jonestown.
We have about three grocery stores, but it's hard in getting some of the things like, when you want fruits, there's no store sell fruits.
Maybe one store will have a few bananas.
They have vegetables, but it's in a can.
I love fresh vegetables and fruit.
It's very frustrating they don't have it here.
DR. ALFIO RAUSA:
There's this thing called a food desert.
So out in the county, you have these mom and pop shops.
And they don't have fruits and veggies.
There are several issues.
Agriculture's a big business.
So I get this big 18-wheeler, and I'm delivering food.
I'll deliver it to Walmart, and I'll deliver it to Kroger, and these others chains, but I can't afford to take my 18-wheeler and go through these back roads.
They're off the beaten path.
So you just don't fit our model, you know.
Maximum delivery, minimum cost.
And so we're consuming what's available to us.
Chips and ice cream and cakes.
They have that here.
They have lots and lots of stuff like that here.
And so, that's why I go to Clarksdale sometimes grocery shopping, or Batesville, about a 45-minute drive.
Those that doesn't have transportation, it's hard.

BARBIE: All right, hon, help Mommy cook.
Mommy cook.
LALANI: I want to help you to make spaghetti.
BARBIE:
Okay. Here you go.
This one goes on the table.
[ Bella chattering ]
BARBIE: The assistance programs in the United States are very hard to qualify for.
It's, like, either you're starving or you don't get any help.
But what defines starving?
Like, if you don't eat for a day, are you starving?
In their eyes, no.
But in your eyes and the way you feel, of course.
' [ Bella giggles]
- Okay.
- [ laughs]
- Good job.
AIDEN:
Mom, can I do the next one?
BARBIE:
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Put that in the water.
But do we gotta break it?
No. You don't gotta break it.
AIDEN:
It goes in the water.
BARBIE:
It was Aiden's turn to help, too.
Put that in there.
Okay, that was a bad idea.
BARBIE:
I do get food stamps now, but they last about three weeks out of the month.
And for that last week,
I'm just going crazy.
- [spoon clanging ]
- Is it good?
Mm-hmm.
Put them in there.
- The ones that are cut.
- I'm making.
JAMES McGOVERN: I lived on a food stamp diet for a week along with Jo Ann Emerson from Missouri.
We did so because we thought that the food stamp benefit was inadequate.
Most of my colleagues had no idea that the average food stamp benefit was $3.00 a day.
I had my budget, and I went to a supermarket.
It took me an awful long time because you have to add up every penny.
And it has to last you for a week.
And so I did it, and I will tell you,
I was tired, I was cranky,
'cause I couldn't drink coffee,
'cause coffee was too expensive.
There are people who are living on that food stamp allocation.
And you really can't.
For us, it was an exercise that ended in a week.
For millions of other people in this country, that's their way of life.
Every day is a struggle just to eat.
MAN: Um...
Would you take 35?
You're gonna have to put something back.
BRIDGES: Back in the '80s, when I formed the End Hunger Network, we wanted to show what it was like to live in America and, you know, be holding down three jobs and, you know, you got a couple of kids and maybe a medical problem, and you've gotta put food on the table, keep a roof on your head, and it's--
It's really a daunting task.
And we wanted to make a film about that.
And it was made, you know, 10, 12 years ago, and it doesn't seem out of date at all.
It seems--
It seems just as fresh as the day we made it.
The problem is getting-- is getting worse.
The policy and my own feeling in this administration is that if there is one person in this country hungry, that is one too many.
And for those who cannot do for themselves, society has to respond.
In this era of unprecedented prosperity, we still have some work of our own to do.
We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease.
And that is precisely what America is doing.
We are Americans.
We are tougher than the times we live in, and we are bigger than our politics have been, so let's meet the moment, let's get to work, and let's show the world once again why the United States of America remains the greatest nation on Earth.
[ Applause]
We've got 44 million Americans on the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance program, what we used to call food stamps.
One out of every two kids in the United States at some point in their childhood will be on food assistance.
You better watch it.
[bell jingles]
BARBIE: Come on.
[ Kids shouting ]
Chips right here, Mommy.
- Can I have a cheeseburger?
- Huh?
No.
Mom, I need a doughnut.
BARBIE:
No, you got chips in your hand.
- I want a doughnut.
- You don't need doughnuts.
- [ <=n/ins 1
- Aiden.
I want a doughnut!
[crying]
BARBIE: Aiden's first year of life was a period of a lot of struggle.
At that time,
I was making $9.00 an hour.
Buying food was really an obstacle for me.
So I applied for food stamps, which means
I was in the welfare office from 8:00 in the morning to 4:30 in the afternoon, to then be told that
I was $2.00 over the income limit.
So because I was
$2.00 over the income limit,
I didn't--I was not eligible for even a dollar in food stamps.
Watch.
So, you know, I didn't have what they needed, or there just wasn't any more food.
And I feel like it affected Aiden a lot.
[ Door closes ]
- Mom.
- Yes?
Here, it's--[ mumbling ]
- My Elmo.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- I want a hug.
- Huh?
- [ mumbles]
[continues mumbling]
What happened?
- House.
- What happened with the house?
[mumbling]
What happened? Mommy room?
BARBIE: Aiden--he was constantly in and out of the hospital.
He was diagnosed with G6PD, which is an immune deficiency.
He has hearing problems, and earlier this month, he was diagnosed with speech delay.
[mumbling]
DR. MARIANA CHILTON:
Any kind of nutritional deprivation, however short that it could be, in those first three years of life can have lifelong consequences for a child.
[Aiden crying incoherently ]
CHILTON: It affects their cognitive development, their ability to get along with others.
No!
DOCTOR: Let's shine our flashlight here and look.
They could be constantly sick, constantly getting infections, because they're not well nourished.
DOCTOR:
Do you know, has he had any colds?
He's actually a little sick right now.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
CHILTON: It can truncate a child's developmental potential.
Whether or not it affects their growth outcomes, sort of their physical-- their stature and their weight, it affects their brain at a much deeper level.
[children chattering ]
Okay, mine is about this, um, goddess or queen.
Her husband died, and he gave half of his kingdom to the Romans and...
LESLIE NICHOLS: Hunger definitely impacts my classroom.
I have had students come to me upset, and it's definitely a huge issue in our small community.
We are going to spend a little bit of time talking about how to use context clues to help us when we find words in the textbooks that we're reading.
One student in particular, Rosie,
I just really felt that she wasn't really applying herself in the classroom, and I couldn't figure out where that attitude was coming from.
I felt that she just really didn't care about what
I wanted her to learn or that school was that important, and what I realized when I brought her in one day was the main issue was that she was hungry.
ROSIE: I struggle a lot.
And most of the time, it's because my stomach is really hurting.
NICHOLS:
So let's take a look.
ROSIE: And my teacher tells me to get focused, and she told me to write "focus" on one of those stickers.
And every time I look at it,
I'm, like, "Oh, I'm supposed to be focusing."
I start yawning, and then I zone out.
And I'm just looking at the teacher, and I look at her, and all I think about is food.
So I have these little visions in my eyes.
NICHOLS: You're still gonna use the same skills.
ROSIE: Sometimes when I look at her,
I vision her as a banana, so she goes like a banana.
And everybody in the class is like apples or oranges.
And then I'm, like, "Oh, great."
NICHOLS: What were the two you were trying to narrow it down to?
- IIAII IIB-II
- IIAII IIB-II
And why were you thinking "A"?
Um--Me, um--
DR. J. LARRY BROWN:
We are tying the arms behind the backs of children as they go into public schools.
We're making it so that we spend money for teachers and that we deliver to them a lot of children who can't learn.
The lost potential--
Some of those kids could potentially be a great scientist or go on to be leaders in our armed forces, but the impact that hunger has messes everything up.
And as a result of that, we're weakening our nation.
TOM COLICCHIO:
Food was really important growing up, especially around holidays.
We had to be home for dinner every night.
My mother was the typical Italian mother who would not sit down unless everybody was served.
Um, and I think that was, you know, her way of showing how much she loved her family.
I was in high school at the time.
My mother decided to take a job managing a school cafeteria at Elizabeth where we grew up.
Years later, my brother and I, we tried to get her to retire.
And she sat down and she said,
"You know, I'm not ready to retire yet."
I said, "Why?"
She said, "You know, these kids
"that come into my lunchroom for breakfast and lunch,
"I know this is the only thing they're eating all day."
[dramatic music]
For your elimination challenge, you'll be feeding students using the same restrictive budget that our public schools have:
$2.68 per child.
Childhood nutrition has become a huge health crisis in this country.
And in this challenge, we were looking at various things.
Part of it to get kids to eat vegetables and stuff and whether or not you were cooking food that was appropriate for a school lunch.
I had wanted to do a healthy dessert that incorporated fruits, but that was not possible within our budget.
The point was that you guys would get tripped up because that's the problem that the country has.
Did you find that you had to add more sugar because the bananas were starchy?
I believe there was a total of about two pounds of sugar.
POPPENDIECK:
What's served in the schools is very much a function of the kind of investment we've been willing to make.
If you figure that the federal government is reimbursing schools
$2.68 for a meal that's served free, and you take out the labor cost and the administrative cost and cost for gas and electricity and custodial services and what have you, it really doesn't leave a lot for food.
Most schools report that they have between
90¢ and a dollar to actually spend on food.
ANN COOPER: We're spending less than a dollar, okay? On lunch.
Now I don't know about you, but I go to Starbucks and Peet's and places like that, and a Venti latte in San Francisco is $5.00.
One gourmet coffee-
One--is more--
We spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools.
COLICCHIO: The dollars that are being used for reimbursement haven't changed since 1973.
We need to get better nutritious foods in school.
And the only way to do that is by increasing the amount of the reimbursement.
[9aVel pounds]
CONGRESSMAN: The Committee on Education and Labor will come to order.
Good morning to everyone.
This morning, we'll discuss a new bipartisan child nutrition legislation we introduced earlier this month to address critical health and economic needs in this country.
As thinking adults, as fellow parents, this is an egregious abdication of our responsibility towards kids.
Let's fund school programs at a spending level that significantly raises the quality and variety of what schools can afford.
TOM VILSACK: A country as strong, as rich, as powerful as ours, and yet we have youngsters who are hungry?
It's one of the reasons why Harry Truman in 1946 established the school lunch program, because he recognized that a country was only as strong as its youth.
Only 25% of youngsters in America today, ages 19 to 24, are fit for military service.
And one of the principle reasons for that is that too many of our youngsters are overweight.
The Institute of Medicine did a study of the nutritional value of the meals that we are currently serving to our children and found that there was too much fat, too much sugar, too much sodium, not enough fruits, not enough vegetables.
There is obviously room for improvement.
And that's why I'm here today to encourage this committee and this Congress to take action now, not to delay.
There are concerns on both sides of the aisle by many members of Congress, and I think by the American people, that we don't have enough money to do everything we want to do.
When it comes to domestic issues, the health and education of our nation's children,
I think is one of our highest priorities.
If we don't change the direction we're heading, this generation will be the first to live sicker and die younger than their parents' generation.
Check it out.
I want to see how tall you are, okay?
- [oxygen hissing ]
- Okay.
Thank you. High five.
High five.
Okay, since March of last year, did you ever eat less than you felt that you should because there wasn't enough money to buy food?
Yes.
Since March of last year did you ever cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there wasn't enough money for food?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
CHILTON:
How often did this happen?
- It happens quite a lot.
- Okay.
BOY: Okay, okay, okay.
CHILTON:
I was really frustrated because I felt like anyone can see how touching those interviews are in the emergency room,
A mother when she starts to cry
'cause she's working, trying hard to take care of her kids, she's scared for the health of her child.
We see that on a daily basis in the emergency room.
But then I'd go to Congress, and I would announce the numbers and pronounce how important food stamps are.
And I just felt like the legislators there were not really listening, that they could not relate.
I felt like it's time for me to be quiet and give the power of framing the issue of food insecurity and hunger to the people who are experiencing hunger themselves.
Everybody say, "Washington!"
ALL: Washington!
[ Indistinct chatter]
CHILTON: Here's the plan.
At 11 :30, the reception at the Senate.
Senator Casey will speak,
I will speak,
Tiana will speak,
Barbie will speak.
And every time that you have an opportunity, give your ideas for change, for what you need for the success and healthy life of your kids, okay?
These guys are the ones who make it happen.
BARBIE: I was the first mother in Witnesses to Hunger, and I didn't think anyone would take us seriously.
But I am here to let everyone know that just because we live where we live, and come from where we come from, doesn't mean that we're not smart.
It doesn't mean we don't have potential.
It doesn't mean that we not--
We do not want education, doesn't mean that we want to depend on welfare for the rest of our lives.
I want the same hopes and dreams as everyone in this room for their children.
We just need the opportunity to make it come true.
Came from, and where we're at now and where we're going to be.
WOMAN: As you walk through the Rotunda and you look at our pictures, look into our eyes, see our pain.
Our pictures that you see in the exhibit demonstrate what we go through every day.
This is un--
It's unnecessary.
CHILTON:
One of the most important things about Witnesses to Hunger is the whole concept of change.
This is not simply just empowerment for the women.
This is about sincere and profound legislative change.
McGOVERN: I know some of this stuff is not easy to talk about.
But yet you're down here, and I am very, very grateful.
And I feel food should be a right.
We have a lot of lobbyists who come down here who get well-paid and talk about other things, so--
You know, you're kind of a dream come true for me, because I want people to descend on Capitol Hill, you know, and talk about the need to make sure that we focus on issues dealing with poverty and hunger and nutritious food.
Anyway, thank you for coming all the way up to the Rules Committee.
WOMAN:
Thank you so much.
MAN: The Obama Administration takes this opportunity very seriously.
The administration proposed an historic investment of $10 billion in additional funding over ten years.
As we reauthorize the programs, have you been able to work through the budget process to determine whether we can pay for them?
Senator, I think it's important to focus on what the cost of inaction and inactivity might be.
And as you well know,
Senator, from your experience, you fund your priorities.
You fund your priorities.
DAVID BECKMANN: The President proposed an additional $1 billion a year to strengthen child nutrition programs.
And he was very clear.
Let's take that money away from some of the least justifiable payments to affluent landholders.
Well, that part of his proposal died within 24 hours.
Both the Ag committees said,
"No way, you're not touching that."
CONGRESSWOMAN:
We want to thank everyone as we begin the committee's work to reauthorize the Federal Child Nutrition Programs.
Hopefully, we'll be able to work this out.
I hate to pit agriculture against nutrition, would seem to be inconsistent.
JONATHAN STEIN:
The Agriculture Committee is there to allocate lots of money to agribusiness, support and subsidize the prices of other agriculture products, and we're very sorry that we're not going to address fully childhood hunger.
We are voting on yet another bill that calls for the government to grow, expand, spend more, and intrude more.
I can't help but be reminded of the fact that my friends on the other side of the aisle have borrowed countless billions of dollars to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.
They have no problem with doing that.
The critical investment this bill makes are completely paid for and will not add 1¢ to the national debt.
CHILTON: The fact that they call it the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act and then, at the same time, scoop money out of the food stamp program, that to me is a paradox.
You can't just, like, push a tiny bit of mashed potatoes from one side of the plate to the other and say,
"Okay, now we have fed you."
McGOVERN:
It's not a victory.
You're taking money out of the mouths of poor people, and, yeah, you're putting it toward a good cause, which is child nutrition, but why are we--
Why are we making this choice?
SHORE:
The great temptation in Washington is to always take something away from those who, frankly, can't defend themselves.
I think we spent maybe $700 billion on the banking and insurance bailout, so $4.5 billion is really just a fraction of that.
It's kind of symptomatic of how lopsided things have become in Washington as a result of special interests that frankly control a lot of the Congressional agenda.
NESTLE:
As long as we have a system where corporates can fund election campaigns, we're going to have legislators who are more interested in corporate health than public health.
It's just appalling.
You know, if another country was doing this to our kids, we would be at war.
This is, you know, it's just insane.
And it doesn't have to be that way.
CHARLES KURALT: These children, all of them, are Americans.
And all of them are hungry.
One of the most poignant things that occurred during the 1960s to really put hunger on the national agenda was a special hour-long documentary by CBS in 1968.
ANNOUNCER:
Here for CBS Reports is Charles Kuralt.
Food is the most basic of all human needs.
Man can manage to live without shelter, without clothing, even without love.
But man can't remain alive without food.
We're talking about 10 million Americans.
In this country, the most basic human need must become a human right.
BROWN: It galvanized public opinion in such a way that President Nixon and the Democratic leaders of Congress decided they had to do something about hunger at our time.
The moment is at hand to put an end to hunger in America itself for all time.
The past ten years now, the federal government has spent billions of dollars fighting hunger in America.
BROWN: They expanded the food stamp program to make it a national program, they expanded the elderly feeding programs, they instituted a school breakfast program to go along with the school lunch program which had gone back to the 1940s.
It showed that public policy could work.
Political will could work to make a difference in our country.
BERG: Regular Americans rose up and demanded that we create a modern nutrition assistance safety net, which almost helped us almost end hunger entirely by the late 1970s.
KYRA PHILLIPS: Joining us this morning from Washington,
Jeff Bridges, the national spokesman for Share Our Strength, and also the group's founder and executive director Billy Shore.
Welcome to both of you.
Thanks forjoining us this morning.
BRIDGES:
Good morning, Kyra.
- Thank you.
- Jeff, let me start with you.
You've been passionate about this for a long time.
I know that you founded the End Hunger Network back in 1983.
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell us about this new campaign, the No Kid Hungry campaign that launches today.
We're in dire straits.
We have 17 million of our children who are living in homes with food insecurity.
And I believe no child in America should go hungry, and by taking this pledge,
I'm adding my voice to the national movement of people who are committed to end childhood hunger in America by 2015.
Back in the early '80s, when I went to a seminar about ending world hunger, hunger was pretty much handled in America.
We had food stamps and the WIC program that were really keeping hunger at bay.
And then these programs started to be underfunded.
And I figured, well, you know, it's a little difficult to be telling some other country on how to handle hunger when we're not handling it ourselves.
We virtually eradicated hunger in America in the 1970s, but it's back with a vengeance.
SHORE: People look back on the Reagan years, and particularly during the recession, and they saw several things happen.
There were a lot of tax cuts, so the government's tax base shrunk.
There was a big increase in defense spending.
And so how is that going to be made up?
It was made up by cutting the budgets of a lot of social programs.
So at a time that need was going up more in the country, they cut the programs that made them less.
And what popped out of that equation?
More hungry people on the streets.
BERG: The '80s created the myth that A: hungry people deserved it, and B: well, we could really fill in the gaps with charities.
POPPENDIECK:
And so we had a proliferation
Of emergency responses.
Soup kitchens, food pantries, moving from literally a shelf in the cupboard of the pastor's office to an operation with regular hours.
BROWN: Something changed during that period of time.
There developed this ethos that government was doing too much.
And more importantly, the private sector's wonderful.
And let's feed people through charity.
POPPENDIECK:
We have basically created a kind of secondary food system for the poor in this country.
Millions and millions of Americans, as many as 50 million Americans, rely on charitable food programs for some part of meeting their basic food needs.
431 and 451 for backpacks for this week.
WILSON: Every Wednesday we go down and get a trailer full of food from Food Bank of the Rockies.
The problem that we run into in small towns is that the income level has gone down, the jobs are minimal, the second- and third-generation people are having to leave the area to find work.
Ten years ago or so, when we started this, my wife and I had purchased an old Suburban.
And I remember driving it to the food bank and being excited about backing up and filling that Suburban with 10 to 15 boxes of food, and thinking we were really making a difference in our community.
And after a year and a half, we bought a little single-axle trailer that we could put two pallets of food in it.
And we thought we had really arrived, that that--
We could certainly meet the needs of the community with two pallets of food.
And four years ago, a gentleman from our church donated this trailer and now we're doing four pallets twice a week.
And it's--It's amazing how the need has increased over the ten years.
APPELHANZ: About a month ago, we had three officers including myself.
However, due to budget constraints, we're now down to just me.
It was always kind of a prideful thing that I never needed anybody's help.
Unfortunately, I haven't received a pay raise in four years.
And what I used to spend on a month in groceries now gets me about two weeks.
[ Indistinct chatter]
I have utilized
Pastor Bob's food bank.
The way it makes me feel, it's very humiliating.
Uh, well, incorrect.
That--It's not humiliating.
It's, um, very grounding.
The stereotype of food banks is always for the unemployed or the disabled, people that can't go out and get a job.
That's not always the case.
Sometimes in life, you just get to points where you need a little extra help.

JOEL LONG:
Ranching is a good part of life.
It's a lot of work.
But it's an honest--
Actually, it's an honest trade.
But the way the economy and everything has gone south,
I have had to go find another job out of the house.
So I work on the ranch from 7:00 in the morning till 3:00 in the afternoon.
And then at 3:00 in the afternoon till 11:00 at night,
I got down and clean the school.
- [vacuum hums]
- J' And a secret J'
J' In an envelope J'
LONG: It's a good job.
It's close to home.
There's a lot that you--
You worry about.
Your kids is the main one.
And that's part of the reason
I did take a second job is so I can help buy groceries and put food on the table for my kids.
Come on, dogs.
[ Indistinct chatter]
Don't touch and don't look.
- [ Indistinct]
- Cool.
[conversation inaudible]
LONG:
Pastor Bob and his wife, they do give 'em a warm meal after school.
[ Indistinct chatter]
- Hi, Daddy.
- Howdy.
LONG:
It helps, you know.
It's getting harder to try to figure out how to make all your ends meet.
But you gotta do what you have to do to help support what you created, you know.
All right.
Do you need help?
- Nope.
- Okay. Thank you.
I'll grab three off there as I go by.
NICHOLS: I was one of those kids that was hungry.
Growing up, it was difficult, because I could see how difficult it was for my mother when she would return from the food bank.
It was embarrassing.
I remember
I was in second grade, and just remembering opened up the refrigerator for, like, the first time in my life and going, "Wow."
I'm one of those kids, you know, that you hear about on TV, or you see about on TV.
There was, like, two carrots in the bottom of the crisper.
And I just remembered thinking,
"What are we gonna do?"
I deliver food bags every week from the food bank at our local church.
It's uncomfortable sometimes, so what I've tried to do is get an understanding of their schedules, and then drop it off and leave it, so it's not that added pressure.
And I know that they're thankful, because it's gone when I come back.
[dog barking ]
I know how I operated.
It wasn't very good.
I didn't do well in school.
I didn't have that great of attendance.
And I just felt like
I kind of lived under this umbrella of feeling inferior to others.
It messes with you.
It's just still always there.
Rosie just really struggles.
You know, she was significantly behind.
But despite all of that, she tries so hard to be so positive all the time.
One of my own personal missions was to try to see if there was something I could do that could make a difference.
And I asked her if she'd be interested in the food bags.
And she was very excited.
ROSIE:
We could do with another one.
NICHOLS: [ laughs]
You want cake for breakfast, right, Rose?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.
- I'll take that in for you.
- Okay.
You guys got your hands full.
- I'll just walk it in for you.
- Okay.
All rightv-
- How are you, Miss Nichols?
- I'm good, thanks.
You ready for your last big week of school before Christmas?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
O K3)!
Blah. There we go.
Okay, a bunch of graham crackers.
DAWN: Mrs. Nichols comes about once a week.
It's eight bags that she brings.
There might be potatoes.
There might be bread.
You know, right now, I think we have
30 jars of peanut butter.
That's just one of the things that Mrs. Nichols brings out right now.
There's always some kind of soups,
Spaghettios, a lot of snacks.
I like these.
Ooh, now these ones...
Sometimes, I will admit,
I do feel a little bit guilty bringing 'em food bags, because it's starch, it's lots of carbohydrates, it's lots of sugars and other chemicals.
Grandma, we got apple pie bars.
DAWN: Oh, awesome.
Apple pie.
NICHOLS: In a perfect world, you would want it to be as well-balanced as you could make it, but the reality is you get what you can.
And giving something is certainly more than nothing.
And so you just kind of find a little bit of...
[ chuckles ]
I guess reassurance in knowing that you are making a difference, even though it's not perfect.
Okay. Give these three--
- Are you gonna take 'em all?
- Yeah, I got 'em.
All right. Thank you.
- Good job on your basketball game.
- Thank you.
CHILTON: That's something that's extremely important.
The churches and the community groups that do hand out food are doing an incredible service to this country and to the children that are experiencing hunger.
But that's just a quick fix.
That's for today and tomorrow, maybe for next week.
We call it emergency food.
It's no longer emergency food.
This is called chronic use of a broken system for which people cannot be held accountable.
POPPENDIECK: If people are gonna be relying on this food as a significant portion of their food intake over time, then we do need to pay attention to what kind of food are they getting?
BRIDGES:
Charity is a great thing, but it's not the way to end hunger.
We don't fund our Department of Defense through charity, you know.
We shouldn't, you know, see that our kids are healthy through charity either.
There should be, you know, something that--
In our country, in America, the richest country in the world, you know, we should, you know, take care of our kids.
We have tried
1,000 points of light.
We have tried it in spades.
But with all that expansion of private feeding, all of that effort, especially by the faith communities, we have not reduced hunger.
PATEL: Our legislators only think of the cost of hunger in America as being what it is that they spend on food stamps.
But the genuine cost of hunger in America is way, way higher.
- Hey, Mr. Broom.
- Hey, Doc. How you doing?
I gotta get a forklift to get your chart out the door.
BROOM:
What do you think? [ laughs]
You gotta roll around on a cart.
DR. WILLIAM BOOKER:
Yeah. How you doing today?
- Not too good, Doc.
- Uh-oh.
Where have you noticed the swelling at?
BROOM: My legs again.
And the fluids get all riled and jump up, and I just--
Oh, I mean, I be scared to lay back down.
I just sit on the side of the bed and halfway doze.
Okay, for the last couple of days, how have you been doing?
Uh, if I walk ten steps,
I get out of breath.
BOOKER: Obesity makes all other medical problems worse.
High blood pressure, diabetes.
We probably diagnose new cases of diabetes four, five, six times a week.
This is Dr. Booker.
I need a telemetry bed
- for Mr. John Broom.
- John Broom.
Congestive heart failure.
I'm going to directly admit him.
He's gonna bring his orders by the emergency room.
Those younger people who are developing those diseases at an early age are gonna get the end-stage complications a lot earlier.
So education is what it's gonna take to get people to do what they need to do to reduce some of these problems.
And we need to start it very early on.
ODESSA CHERRY:
At the bathroom, line up at the door.
I am Odessa Cherry.
I am a second-grade teacher here at Jonestown Elementary School.
Love it. I've been teaching over 17 years.
I love the babies.
I was diagnosed with diabetes.
And it's been about a year-- almost a year.
And when I was first diagnosed,
I told the doctor,
"I don't want the pill.
"I think I can do it with just diet."
And so that was the one thing that really got me to thinking about what you're eating.
Oh, check it out.
Did y'all see that?
Is that what--
Is that what sparked y'all talkin' about what he said, huh?
'Cause I was wondering what it was.
CHERRY:
And when the change started, everybody was, like,
"What, no fried chicken?
"No fried fish?"
That was the biggest thing, that fried fish, 'cause we love catfish in this area.
I mean, if it's not fried, it's not fish, so...
And it was just, "I don't eat that.
"I don't eat this. I don't like that.
I don't like--"
And I'm like,
"Have you tried it?"
And I have many of 'em say, "No."
And so I'm saying, "Try it."
And I'm trying to force myself to try it because, you know, this is new to me.
And once you eat it, it's like,
"That's not bad."
Now, that helped me to understand the impact that we can have on our children.
And the younger they are, the better.
Awareness is the beginning.
[dog barking in distance]
You did good. Yeah.
This is a kitchen.
This is our table, and this is our microwave.
If you want tea, just push "hot water,"
And then it goes.
And it's really cool.
And this is our box where we put all of our food that we get from the food bank and from Miss Nichols.
And this is our bedroom.
Excuse me...
It's not that pleasant.
This is where I sleep, right on this pillow.
This is where my sister sleeps with her dog.
And this is where we have-- put all of our clothes.
When my friends come over,
I get embarrassed because they have bigger rooms than I do.
And, well, we try to keep it clean.
And I put flowers up because I just wanted to decorate it and make it look nice.
Kitty.
PATEL: Is it that people are going hungry because of a shortage of food?
No, it is not.
The reason people are going hungry is not because of a shortage of food.
It's because of poverty.
Then, all of a sudden, you're in a different question.
You're not asking,
"Why is there insufficient food?" which is this sort of very beneficent question.
But it turns out to be,
"Why are people poor?"
And right there, you're in a political question, and one that's far more difficult to answer, and involves asking questions about power, and about, you know, class, and about inequality, and the persistent inequality in this country.
And that's a much harder question to ask than the question about, well, is there enough food in America?
To which, clearly, the answer is yes.
MARTY MOSS-COANE:
Barbie, you got it. [ laughs]
So have a seat.
And, Mariana, I'm gonna stick you over here.
From WHYY in Philadelphia, this is Radio Times.
I'm Marty Moss-Coane.
And today on the show, what does it mean to be "food insecure"?
I mean, we shouldn't be surprised that there are-- that there's hunger in this country, when you look at the level of poverty.
And I wonder just how much of a-- sort of denial there is out there.
And, of course, we are still, as I think's true today, the richest country in the world.
And this disconnect between all this wealth and people that don't have enough.
If you look at the food insecurity numbers in this country,
85% of those families that are food insecure have at least one working adult in the household.
So from my perspective, how do people get out of poverty?
They get--
They earn a living wage.
And so I think we need to turn it around to accountability.
It's government accountability.
It's also corporate accountability for ensuring that people get living wages.
I mean, it sounds like a lot of emotional stress and strain that you both have.
- The humiliation of it?
- Yes.
BARBIE: Being labeled as "low income" is shameful in itself.
It's the reality, but you don't want to admit that, okay, I am of low income.
Or because of we're of low income, we have to stand in this line and receive food from whoever wants to give it to us.
- So I think...That's what--
- That's tough.
MOSS-COANE:
Yeah, how about for you, Crystal?
It seems like America has turned a blind eye to the fact that people are hungry on a day-to-day basis.
It's not just women.
There's men who are raising their children.
There are two-parent households who go to work every day, and still have to turn to public assistance to sustain their families, which makes no sense.
LALANI:
Which is our bus?
BARBIE:
We gotta watch out for the bus.
[ Indistinct]
Do I got toothpaste on my face?
No? Okay.
LALANI: No.
BARBIE: Yeah.
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-mm.
- Yep.
- Uh-uh.
There's a difference in your step.
Like, when you're on your way to work, and you know that
"I'm going to work now..." it's a different type of walk that you--
A different pace to your walk.
Okay.
[ Phone ringing ]
Thank you for calling the food stamp hotline.
How can I help you?
Okay, so according to the information that you've given me, it's telling me you're eligible for about $16 in food stamps.
Do you have any other questions?
It's hectic sometimes, but I just look at it as though every day
I have the chance to put food in someone's mouth.
Not directly, but I know what it's like to be turned down.
And now I'm on the other side, so it makes me feel good.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna cry...
[ laughs]
[children chattering ]
- Y'all want this?
- What?
- BOTH: No.
- Why not?
Because.
Um, eat, um...sandwich.
All right, but you need to eat food.
- We ate food.
- What you ate?
We ate chips.
BARBIE: That's not food.
That's it.
AIDEN:
I want to eat, too.
- The meatballs.
- Who's gonna help me?
- Me. Me.
- Wait, Mommy.
BARBIE: Hold it.
Anyone can sit there and tell you,
"Oh, I've been through this,
I've been through that.
"I got through it."
Yeah, I've been through this,
I've been through that,
I got through it, but if you open my fridge,
I'm there again.
Five days into the month.
And I'm gonna be there next month and the month after that.
It gets tiring.
Oh, we're good. Let it go.
LALANI:
I was gonna help you again.
- No.
- That's it?
Lalani.
When I was on food stamps,
I didn't have to worry about my kids not eating.
It was just how can I make it stretch?
You know, I might have to take a little bit from this day.
It was more about balancing everything, where now we have nothing.
[children chattering ]
I literally have nothing left.
Like, I'm gonna give 'em a Hot Pocket for dinner tomorrow.
What am I supposed to do?
What do I give them?
Yeah.
We have to put a system in place where people get-- and have enough time--to get themselves back on their feet.
It's not like you get a full-time job, the next month you're off of food stamps, and all is--all is well.
It doesn't happen that way.
We don't have a food policy in this country to address hunger.
We never have.
We have a welfare system that is very limited in its ability to get people on their feet, which is what you really want, is you want to empower people to be able to make enough money to buy their own food and take care of their own needs.
We don't have anything that does that.
BROWN: We sort of have this love-hate relationship with poverty and the poor.
On the one hand, you know, we have a wonderful history of helping others and a lot of good rhetoric.
"Bring us your struggling masses yearning to be free."
This is the land of opportunity, and we care about one another.
And we do in many ways.
But our care is always predicated on the fact that we're worried that somebody else is getting something for free or something they don't deserve.
BECKMANN: In our country, we put a lot of emphasis on self-reliance, on everybody fending for themselves, liberty.
And those are all great strengths.
But as a nation, it has not been our strength to do what we can to reduce poverty.
"Corduroy is a bear who once lived
"in the toy department of a big store."
BARBIE: I feel like America has this huge stigma of how families are supposed to eat together at a table.
But they don't talk about what it takes to get you there.
Or what's there when you're actually at the table.
Bring that bucket.
[ Indistinct chatter]
There's probably
600, 700 chefs here, all really committed to helping this problem that we have with child obesity and hunger.
- Here, grab the leaves...
- Okay.
And break them in pieces like this.
- We're gonna toss on the spinach.
- Oh, look at that.
MICHELLE OBAMA:
We're working to make sure that families and communities across this country have access to quality affordable food.
[ Overlapping conversations ]
It's so good.
COLICCHIO: If they get a first taste of broccoli and green beans and peas and things like that, it'll stick with them for life.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
COLICCHIO: There's a lot of education that needs to sort of happen again around food, and around what is healthy.
And there has gotta be a way where healthy food-- fruits and vegetables-- are made accessible and less expensive than they are now.
NESTLE:
We're spending $20 billion a year on agricultural subsidies for the wrong foods.
$20 billion would go a very long way to promoting a healthy, educated population, starting with kids.
Now, close the book.
Put the book away.
Thank you. All right.
I want you to feel this so you can see the texture of the outside of the honeydew melon.
Uh, try not to drop it.
Look at the color.
You kinda feel the weight.
What is this called?
KIDS: Honeydew melon.
Honeydew melon.
CHERRY: We are now--
We are pushing, if you go to the store, and Mom asks you,
"What you want?"
Don't say chips.
Say, "I want fruit."
And so we're looking for inexpensive healthy foods.
So that's what we're working on now in the classroom.
And we're looking for alternatives.
Is it rough or is it smooth?
- KIDS: It's smooth.
- It's smooth.
I brought it so that when they see it in the store, they can relate.
"That's a honeydew not sliced already."
- Everybody ready?
- [overlapping replies]
Get set...and taste.
What adjectives would you use to describe the honeydew melon?
Good. Juicy. Everything.
[ laughter]
Would you buy one?
How many of you would buy, or would like to buy a honeydew melon?
BOY: I'd buy two of 'em.
You would buy two.
You love 'em, huh?
But now, what about how you like 'em compared to chips?
Which one do you like better?
[overlapping answers]
Honeydew! Honeydew!
Honeydew! Honeydew, baby!
Let's take a vote.
How many people love the honeydew, would prefer the honeydew over the chips?
If you said--
Ooh, we're way over 50%.
- [ Kids cheer]
- I love it. I love it. Mm-hmm.
NICHOLS: I think I go out of my way to try to take that burden and that worry away from kids because I was there.
And teaching, it kind of puts you in that natural place to say, you know, yes, obviously
I can make a difference in the education of a child, but I think it's so much more than that.
It's that personal connection that goes beyond that.
Last year you missed... twenty days of school.
This year you've missed seven days.
And five were when you had pink eye and you couldn't be at school.
And I know you wanted to be at school.
- Yeah, I did.
- Remember when I stopped by your house and we talked about that?
- Yeah.
- So do you think being...
My dream is to be an honor roll student.
[ Reading indistinctly]
My other dream is, um--
Have you heard of the Extreme
Makeover: Home Edition?
I always have a dream every night that they would come tear down our house, let us go for a vacation.
I just wish they would come and actually rescue us from our house.
But we don't have a story like they do.
I want my kids to have a better life than I do.
Have more food, have a bigger house, no mold.
And they get to do what they want to do and what they need to do.
And never be hungry.
Like, you take 'em one at a time.
We know we can't help everyone, but we can help one or two.
So you take those and look at 'em, and go, "Wow.
"In that life, we made a difference."
It's about patriotism, really.
Yeah, that's what it is, you know?
Stand up for your country, you know?
How do you envision your country, you know?
Do you envision it-- a country where one in four of the kids are hungry?
What I'm hoping is that maybe an increase in the problem is part of the solution.
That that's gonna finally wake people up to how--
You know, what dire straits we're in here with this.
CHILTON:
Do we just continue to give more cans of food through the food drives?
That's not the answer.
The answer is widespread governmental programs that are focused on the human being.
SHORE: I think Americans, basically, want to do the right thing.
There's a lot of issues that we could all struggle with for a long time we wouldn't know how to solve.
I don't know how to solve the climate change problem, you know, by myself.
I don't know how to come up with a vaccine for AIDS.
I don't know how to, you know, end terrorism.
But when it comes to hunger in this country, we know the solutions because we've proven it in the past.
POPPENDIECK:
We all have a stake in this, and we really need to reclaim agricultural policy as a policy on behalf of us all.
We're wasting billions of dollars by not spending less to fix hunger.
PATEL: We all understand that the government will do the right thing only after every other possibility has been exhausted.
We need to bring government to the right thing much more quickly.
But the only way to do that is not by, you know, saying, "Well, you know,
"government will take care of it," but by making government care.
We need to make this an issue where if you're not with us on ending hunger, then we're not gonna be with you on reelection.
I mean, if making sure people have enough to eat is not an important issue, then I don't know what the hell is.
BARBIE:
"'You are where you come from.'
"it is a quote that is said very often.
"If your mother was a single mother,
"you will be a single mother.
"If no one in your family was a high school graduate,
"you will be the next one to follow in those footsteps.
"Have you ever been surrounded by the people you love,
"like your children, but feel completely alone?
"Have you ever been in a home with open doors,
"but feel trapped?
"Have you ever been in a neighborhood
"with constant yelling, screaming, gunshots,
"and fighting, but are so accustomed to it
"that it puts you to sleep?

Dear hussars and ISAF Team 7.
This is it.
Is the task important?
Is it still relevant for us Danes?
These are obvious questions that you may be asking yourselves.
Your predecessors in Helmand have pushed forward and made a huge effort in aid of a civilian population -
- that has lived under miserable conditions.
For this, several of our colleagues have paid a high price.
It's your duty to continue unhesitatingly in their footsteps -
- now that your government has charted its political course.
- Yes.
- when are you going to Jutland?
To Jutland?
That will be on ... Thursday.
- And the exercise will last for ...?
- Ten days.
That's it, I think.
It hasn't really dawned upon me that you're actually going.
It doesn't strike you until the goodbyes.
I've spent months trying to figure it out, and I gave up. I just don't get it.
You could say it's like football.
You learn so and so much through practice -
- but you learn more by playing matches.
- You also enjoy the comradeship.
- Of course. That's part of it.
- It's a challenge and an adventure ...
- And that's what hurts!
- An adventure? I can't ...
- But I want the experience. what's up?
Did you get home, or what?
No ...
I'm here now.
Thanks for calling.
Bye. what a trendy hairstyle, Kim!
Not bad at all.
- Is that our own logo?
- No. It says "Spearhead."
The Asian guy with the T-shirt ...
- He's the medic in my group.
- Okay?
- what does he do?
- Patches us up, if necessary.
- Does he go on patrol with you?
- Oh, I see. Yes, he does.
- I think I'll head upstairs.
- Okay.
See you, Mom.
- Goodbye.
- Behave yourself.
I want you to make sure -
- that you pay attention to your surroundings.
Even if you think it's safe and sound.
Forget about yourself and what you look like.
- I'm going to miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.
- I love you.
- I know.
- See you.
- Take care.
See you.
Bye, Dad.
- See you.
- I'll hold you to that, Mads.
- Promise?
- I promise. welcome. welcome.
- Did you have a good trip?
- It was a bit long. we haven't been bored in Armadillo.
400 shells were fired yesterday.
- It was fairly ...
A Taliban mortar fired on us, and we sent off 260 120 mm -
- and 1 20 105 mm.
Air support and Apaches were called in. It wasn't boring.
The Taliban are much more on their toes than I had thought.
They are just 800 m away from Armadillo and on the ball.
- So we'll confront them fairly soon.
- It's good there's work for us.
You can count on some action.
I promise it'll be interesting.
Six months without women.
- You're awfully cheerful.
- After a long night.
- You have M&Ms?
- Hands off. It's my dinner.
- Your dinner?
- what's your problem?
Mini wears size 3 in jackets.
Is that why his helmet says
"King of the Green Zone"? welcome. Grab some water.
I have a few pointers.
Gun line is shooting.
That's why it's so noisy.
If you hear what sounds like a rocket, it's the launchers firing.
It's fired at any time of the day.
There was one. That's normal.
Here are the shower containers.
That's the Green Zone.
Observe as much as possible. when there's combat, you're obviously more exposed -
- so don't just stand there staring.
"walk-ins" stop just over there and call for an interpreter.
It doesn't take long to figure out if they're dicking around -
- or if it's something useful.
- You had some questions.
- Yes.
How far north from Armadillo can we go -
- before the Taliban get active?
About 800-1000 m north of Armadillo.
From up here we can draw a line almost up to the Helmand River.
This area here is basically ours.
His objective is to move south and isolate us so we can't get out -
- and to diminish our influence on the locals. That's what he wants to do.
Our patrolling forces him to meet us here and fight in this narrow pass.
These people are former mujahedeen and used to fight the Russians -
- in the exact same area, so they're used to fighting a superior force.
They're not afraid.
Ten men might attack forty.
Being outnumbered doesn't stop them. Not at all.
- They've got big balls
- That's for sure.
Did you treat the ones who were killed and wounded in December?
Unfortunately me and J were the ones who found the dead on 1 2. 19. we were first on the spot. I grabbed a detector and started sweeping.
As we went around the vehicle, the fucking beam from my headlamp -
- caught this guy right in his face.
He was staring, but dead, of course.
I closed his eyes and covered up his face.
And the last guy ...
There wasn't much left of him.
I collected body parts for six hours.
Everything.
Fingers, a hand in a glove, a knee joint, a heart lying around ...
It's hard to describe what it looks like in a place like that.
You also have to keep an eye on yourself.
You're not wacko, just because you laugh at some irrelevant stuff.
You need normality, 'cause this is so meaningless that you can't grasp it.
- Susanne speaking.
- Hi, it's Mads.
Hi, Mads.
I was hoping it was you.
- How are you?
- Fine. How about you?
That's much more interesting.
- I'm fine. we're in Armadillo.
- Okay.
- What's Dad up to?
- He sitting right here.
I'll let you talk to him.
- Hi, Mads.
- Hi, Dad. How are you?
We're fine, Mads.
But yesterday your mother had a fright -
- when the phone rang in the middle of the night.
I didn't hear it, but she did.
It scared the daylights out of her.
Your first thought is that something terrible has happened.
But it was a business call from India about something they're printing -
- and they forgot about the time difference.
Since we left Denmark, the enemy's objective hasn't changed.
The Taliban's objective is to destabilize security in Helmand -
- and undermine the locals' trust in the ISAF forces.
It's important to get into Haftaran and Athakhan -
- to establish contact with the people. when you eat your field rations -
- and there's something you don't like -
- I suggest you save it and bring it on patrol.
Give it to the children as a sign of goodwill.
Rules of engagement.
Remember that self defense can apply prior to being fired upon.
Such as by confirmed weapons or people moving into a position to fire.
Yes. Go get ready.
Listen up. Line up, so 6-5 can take our picture before our first patrol.
I don't have anything.
I can see why the wadis are dangerous.
They can easily hide an IED.
The thought is sickening.
We're most likely to go around it -
- so it would be stupid to put one here.
905, I saw a man run through the fence on the eastern side -
- of the row of bushes that run from north to south.
Welcome to Nam.
- Hey, interpreter!
- Follow me. Come.
Hayatullah, hurry.
Don't let them onto the poppy field.
This way. Not in the field.
I will show you.
9-0 here. Civilians are showing us the route around the field.
Salaam aleikum.
How are you? Alright?
- Read your book.
- Are you reading? Yes.
- It's a madrassa.
- Are you studying the Koran?
- Have things been calm?
- How is the situation in the area?
- Calm?
- No, where is it safe?
- Are the Taliban in the area?
- They've taken the whole area.
How could you not know?
They're everywhere.
Tell us if you see anything.
So we can get them out of the area. we cannot cooperate with you.
You come with all your weapons, and then you leave.
We're staying here, and then the
Taliban will come after us.
But if you don't cooperate, we cannot secure the area -
- and then we can't build a school for your kids.
You have guns, they have guns.
If I talk, they'll cut my throat.
- First patrol reporting!
- Look at my back!
Look cool, man!
Just a sec.
First patrol reporting.
It didn't feel like anything.
Not really.
I probably will, when we get into the shooting.
But this is also part of it.
It's not all fighting.
Right, we're also here to help these poor people.
It's like going to the fun fair without trying the rollercoasters.
Alright, let's start the debriefing.
The patrol itself. How did it go?
Individual skills really sucked.
Seriously.
How many fell to their knees on short stops?
So, eight men out of 50.
Do we agree that this has to be improved?
Get into the habit now.
Get your fat ass down on its knees -
- because at some point if you don't, then pow!
So kneel, damn it!
Right. Anything else?
I think I ought to say what I got out of this patrol. And it wasn't a lot.
Remember this is an agricultural area.
The peasants have just sown their wheat. And we're ploughing it down.
I could only say that our security out there was to trample their fields down.
Nothing's happening out there yet.
The good old classic. The coolest thing about porn is the story line.
I'd like doctors like that, if I go to hospital.
Strangely enough it helped him!
It's weird, don't you think?
You volunteer to sleep on a tiny cot -
- and eat crap food for six months.
- I know there's more to it.
- I'm doing it for the team spirit.
- Team spirit and adventure.
- Yeah.
- How do your parents feel about it?
- They're not overjoyed.
My parents were like:
"Don't go on missions." -
So I decided to go to Kosovo, and on my first day at the garrison -
- I still thought
I was going to Kosovo.
But at the meeting we were told that Kosovo wasn't an option.
Here it's all 'Afghan'.
I called my mother afterwards -
- and told her I was going to Afghanistan after all.
She cried her eyes out.
Fucking hell, Rasmus. what time is it?
- 41 minutes past.
- What's this? A little mullah?
- Are those animals? Two foxes?
- They sure aren't hedgehogs.
What the hell was that?
- was that mortars?
- Call in and find out.
You know what's going on?
Over.
I have a good idea.
I'll just check it out.
It's probably the person digging from before that we engaged. Over.
It's cool they bombed the idiot.
Too bad we can't see him.
You'll be an easy target now.
- It's doing a recce.
- Nice.
It's our eyes out there.
It's cool that it can check out suspicious things in a compound.
Right.
I'd like to see some action now.
I don't know what my first reaction will be.
We haven't got a chance to know what it's like, when we haven't tried it.
And the thought of these
'foreign fighters', you know.
I can imagine that the first contact will be rather spicy.
He could be Taliban.
Just like anyone of the 7 billion people out there.
- Too bad we can't tell them apart.
- The only difference is the weapon.
He could be hiding it under his clothes.
But it's clever.
Imagine we could do the same.
Do you think anyone is watching us?
- Someone's always watching us.
- Right.
There's bound to be someone in these compounds -
- who is on the Taliban side and keeps an eye on us. what are you seeing? what does he want?
What now, Billy Bob?
Hang on a sec.
- Who?
- This guy.
- Is it the informer?
- No, he's lighting a cigarette.
They don't always do that.
There's been an uproar on the net about the 40 Pakistanis -
- who are said to be entrenched -
- but their presence hasn't been verified. It could be a spook or real. we're going on a domination patrol -
- which is a matter of preventing him from moving freely -
- and denying him the upper hand or being master of the domain.
We've got your back.
Any updates? Over.
- Enemy forces have been sent out.
Roger that.
Who are you?
British? Canadian?
- Danish.
- Danish?
- Are you Jewish or Christian?
- Jewish?
No. we're Christian. why are you here?
Look what you've done to our soil.
Look!
You shot it up.
You killed our cow.
- And you've wounded our family.
- Why did you do that?
- The Taliban are way over there.
- They have lots of big weapons.
And they'll shoot you.
903 Victor, October-fest Carlsberg.
Over.
Roger. when the civilians are gone, they'll open fire. Correct?
Get down!
I have impact.
Scan the area!
- Did you see where it came from?
- Signaler, let's go.
What was that?
90, any report on that smoke? was it incoming?
- What did you say?
- The Taliban are ready to attack.
- It's jammed.
- Shit.
- Cover us, so 6 can get up here.
- This crap isn't working.
Hurry, Mini.
- Allahu Akbar.
- Signaler, into the water.
They're behind the two compounds in a hollow.
- Two shooters.
- Krag, ready to go over the top?
Between the two compounds in the hollow. Ready?
- Over there! Can you see them?
- No.
- They're in the hollow.
- Yes.
Between the two compounds.
Red smoke. 500 m.
- Get ready to fire the recoilless gun.
- Firing !
Reload, reload ... !
Everybody out! way to go!
- Super.
- Well done.
It's a nice big hole.
- what do you think, guys?
- That's what I call a gun slit.
We can see the whole terrain.
He was near the ditch.
- The Taliban are ready to fire.
- Careful! Stay down!
The Taliban have reported they can see five of us.
- Signaler, let's move away.
- I'm coming.
Hit the deck!
- 5, get down!
- Hey! Isn't it over?
No! Get down!
Whisky reports, "Get down."
- The people standing could get shot.
- whisky sees ninjas everywhere.
Yes, the guy's a bundle of nerves.
Did you see those guys running? where ...?
I've got them.
It's just some kids.
Roger. Out.
That was an annoying message.
The locals asked the Taliban not to shoot -
- so they can evacuate the wounded women and children. Not good.
- That's gross.
- Is that a wounded or a dead person?
If they really are cowards, they might be carrying weapons out.
- The thought did cross my mind.
- It's a good excuse to stare at us.
And they can move weapons to a new position, when we're on our way back.
Maybe it's just a civilian casualty.
- That guy's got balls.
- I hate those damn Taliban.
You can't tell who's who, and the dicks shoot from civilian compounds.
- There's not much we can do.
- No, but it's messy.
- What's up, Signaler?
- Well done. Your baptism of fire.
- It was a good start for beginners.
- I was about to say that.
- It was a good start for beginners.
- Everybody out, everybody home.
Mini?
How much 1 2.7 ammo did you fire?
- A lot.
- You're damn right.
This is a bit heavy.
When I got into the barn, the chickens attacked me.
When is the bread done?
Why do we have to do this shit?
Ranger.
Look at this, Mads.
Even if you have a gun,
I'd still win.
- It depends on how far away you are.
- Here.
Let's see who draws first.
You have to release yours,
I just have to swing this.
From down there?
- Can I carry it ...?
- No. Then I'd be like this.
Kim, you can lift it with one hand, right? Or do you need two hands?
- Ready?
- Gotcha.
Three shots to the chest.
- Quite cool .. .
- It doesn't get much better than that.
- See you later, Mads.
- Send my regards.
Alright, Mads?
- I'll close off those streets.
- Fine.
Mini, over there with Kim.
- Why are you with them?
- He's American.
- Why are you with them?
- He's red, too.
Get out of the military. Leave.
- Leave?
- Yes. Go home.
Do you have a home?
I don't owe you any money, if that's what you're saying.
He has funny eyes.
He is slant-eyed.
They look puffy.
He took it in the ass.
I regret your losses, but you all know -
- that we have to walk in the fields.
How should we know?
Is it our fault, maybe?
Last year they bombarded our house.
I swear by God I don't even have any clothes to wear.
And my sons cannot help me.
Then we must leave our villages. what can we do?
What can we do? It's not you or the Taliban that gets killed. we are the ones who get killed.
The civilians get killed.
We sit in our homes and get bombed.
The Taliban shoot, and then they run away. They escape. we're sorry, but we try to move the war up north.
That would be good for us, for this ruins everything.
You can't.
People fight, because they're poor.
Including the Taliban.
- Come on, you faggots.
- Look who's talking.
You planted bombs, you ape!
So far we know that a civilian car approached the gas station -
- on Highway 1 towards the desert, the route we usually take home.
The car hit something and detonated.
There was an explosion.
Our formation is vehicle 1 in front..
Primarily observe from the rifleman's position. we'll see how bad it is when we get there. Okay?
Flip your night vision down and keep a lookout behind.
On our way back from there
I heard a huge explosion.
I couldn't believe it.
I ran back down -
- and 7-5 and 3-5 ran right into me, so I went flying.
Everybody was running all over the place.
Then I heard, "There's blood everywhere. 2-5 is down."
I said, "For fuck's sake, 5.
You should keep your head down."
Then he said, "I know.
How about a dance?" I cracked up.
"This isn't a good time."
Then I gave him emotional first aid.
He had a huge gash here.
Turned out to be a fractured skull.
Damn.
- No fucking fun.
- I'll say.
I heard a massive boom, and everything was sand and dust -
- for a few seconds.
I tried to feel if my teeth were broken with my tongue -
- and I tried to wiggle my fingers.
I couldn't tell if my teeth were okay -
- because I had so much gravel, sand and blood in my mouth.
I only felt splinters and stones.
I didn't know what was what.
I tried ... I don't remember clearly -
- but I looked down and saw two trickles of blood.
It wasn't until I was in the helicopter -
- that I started to get really uncomfortable.
That's when I had time to think about it.
"what do I look like now?
Will I ever recover?"
"will I talk funny for the rest of my life?" All those questions.
I have to go back to Armadillo and stand in front of them all -
- and say, "You can't get rid of me that easily."
- 2-5 here.
- Raven has something.
Three men are walking south.
Can Alpha 1-7 see them running?
Get the coordinates.
- They're splitting up.
Aim at the place that's been used as a firing point.
Do they have to assemble the gun first or what?
9-0. Pancake.
- Alright!
- About bloody time.
- Do you want everyone to meet up?
- Yes ...
2nd platoon, at the vehicles.
There he is! Our man.
- Alright?
- You bet. I'm in great shape.
- Hi, guys.
- You smell good, too.
- But you don't.
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.
- Hey, man.
I'm sick of hugging sweaty guys by now. who else? Jesus Christ.
Hey, guys.
Are we all here?
Hey, man.
- I'm glad you grew that beard again.
- I thought you might feel that way.
- Here's group leader 1 .
- Well, for the time being.
It's fucking great to see you guys.
Any questions?
Great. Let's go.
Signaler, the locals say the Taliban bugged out north and south -
- when they saw us arrive.
Signaler, will you cover me if I run out in the field?
- Probably not.
- This is damn depressing.
All dressed up and no one to blow. This won't do.
- wanna bet?
- Nothing will happen.
Nothing will happen?
It's no fun betting when we agree.
Daniel, how about stripping and running naked across the field?
- That might kick things up a notch.
- His pink body will scare them off.
Shut the fuck up.
The other day ...
My house was bombed.
My cow was killed, and two calves.
They didn't die, they were wounded.
A cow was killed.
Two calves were injured.
Our guard dog was also blown to bits.
Look.
The animals were tied up in here.
There are 19 of us.
The cow gave us milk.
- Now we have nothing, no money.
- We can compensate you for it.
Hello. How are you?
Can you come to the camp this evening or tonight?
It's very difficult.
People get killed. They're afraid.
But it's important that we collaborate.
So we can make peace here.
God willing, we can bring peace to this place. Rebuild the country ...
Exactly, but we'll see.
God will provide. we ... the country is exhausted.
2-1, can we move forward, or do we wait?
- Having a nice time?
- we don't have to cuddle up.
Unless you want to.
I have a hole in my pants.
I can use my finger if you like?
- You missed. A bit further up.
- No thanks.
Christ, this is boring.
Their cow was killed by mortars the day before yesterday.
- You can see where.
- That doesn't look recent.
- It's been like that for a while.
- we saw where he buried the cow. we can sense that the Taliban are intimidating people in the area.
The locals say we're here to kill animals and people.
- And the Taliban take advantage ...
- Of what's going on. Obviously.
Okay, we need to move forward, boys.
- The aerial sees two men in Sierra 5.
- we're at Sierra 5.
- Should we take it and crush them?
- Daniel? New plan.
Two guys in Sierra 5.
Right there!
- Do you want explosives?
- Let's wait and see.
There's still that hole in the wall.
The hole straight ahead.
Proceed. I got it here.
Get in front.
There's something here.
There's a civilian.
Forward.
There's no one here.
Civilians in the compound. we will continue searching.
There's no one here.
Salaam aleikum.
901, 5 is searched. Out.
Fuck, I'm tired of this shit.
They're laughing at us, and we waste time blasting into these compounds.
And they're already gone.
A waste of time.
- Mortar, another 15 ts.
- Ready ...!
Everybody ready ... shoot!
She had abdominal injuries.
And a fractured skull.
I'm the one who says:
That's your target.
I did what we had planned.
There's nothing to do about it.
It's ... I almost said 'spilt milk'.
Harsh words, but that's what it is.
It can't be undone, and you shouldn't blame yourself.
We live in a world, where you watch the news -
- with thousands of people, who die all the time . ..
So it doesn't bother me if a girl dies.
It's just because you're close to it.
I just think ... We came down here, and it wasn't done on purpose. we did exactly what we're supposed to do, and we would do it again.
That's the way it is.
I'm very tired. My house was burnt down, and that's why I'm here.
My mother died, and so did my little child.
We were away. Only my mother and the little one stayed at home.
I told my mother to come along, but she didn't want to.
You have to tell us which things were destroyed.
Quilts, matresses, curtains, plates and lots of other things in my house.
May God forgive your mother.
She has become a martyr.
Mini, observe for the fucking platoon.
A situation is reported -
- but they move forward anyway.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Wait!
Oh no ...!
Say something, man!
Is everyone okay? Over.
Negative, negative.
Condition critical.
He can talk, but has difficulty breathing. Over.
Copy that. Get him to my position quickly. I'll get ready here.
Fuck ...! Here we go.
3-4 here. The helicopter will be here in two minutes.
Copy. We'll start moving him to pick-up point. Over.
We've sent our call signs minus four men -
- who're picking up the last bits. we have a vehicle to secure us and expect to arrive in ten. Over.
His condition is stable, but his left leg was amputated at the thigh -
- and his right leg below the knee.
He was wounded in the groin -
- and in the abdomen, but there was no internal bleeding.
They think he'll survive, but he was seriously wounded.
They've found our weak points and are making the most of them.
Yes, we're good at attacking and moving forward -
- but we're held back because of those damn IEDs we can't find.
It's all fucked up.
When you think about it, you wouldn't feel guilty about -
- shooting those assholes.
I'd feel worse shooting a stray dog.
Right.
On our way back from patrol we were told -
- that three men from Romeo 1-5 hit an IED on Highway 1 .
At that point, they were category B, which is seriously wounded.
When we got back here, we were told all three were dead.
I think everyone was hoping -
- that we would go down in history as the first team not to lose a man.
Then they showed pictures of those three handsome young men -
- who were smiling, and whose eyes were shining.
They looked happy. I can't take much more of this, Mads.
- It's really, really hard.
- Yes.
Please be careful.
Come home soon.
I will.
Another two months to go.
Let's commemorate our three fellow men -
- and honor them and show our respect with a minute of silence.
The men are getting tired.
Wahir, where we were doing well -
- is now infiltrated by the Taliban.
They know exactly how many we are in the camp -
- and when we're up to something or not. we'll have to see ...
... if ambushing them will work.
Is anyone too upset to go?
- I'd like to stay home.
- Me, too.
Mads, are you okay?
You don't mind going? well, if you need me,
I'll come along.
Great.
Go get the job done.
You know what to do, so be careful.
Give them hell in the morning.
That's the whole point.
See you tomorrow.
Safe journey.
One group of enemy forces reported ready. Over.
Several civilians are heading your way.
On the right-hand side of the men in the back.
Women and children are leaving the zone.
There are several combat indicators.
More families are leaving the zone.
There's no mistaking that.
Okay, the last ICOM says they've spotted our patrol and will ambush it.
I have a possible digger about 200-250 m north of me -
- at a compound.
Request warning shot. Over.
Copy. Stand by.
- It's a damn kill zone out there.
- Fine with me, as long as they shoot.
All those on the right, return to the trees.
3, retreat to the compound wall.
- what did you do so far?
- I gave him morphine in the thigh.
And I gave him Fentanyl.
His pulse was fine.
- Can he have a drink?
- Yes. where the hell are those bastards?
- Give me a fucking Taliban, man.
- Forward!
Let's go, move forward.
- Fuck, they almost got me!
- Cover for fuck's sake! Cover!
I can't hear you.
We're in the open field.
Where are you?
You're on my right in the open field.
- Hold your fire!
- 3, you're shooting at the trees.
- I'm on the other side, you idiot.
- The Taliban are in the ditch. what the fuck is he talking about?
The Taliban are in the ditch in front of you.
- Right in front of us!
- Daniel!
- Can you get him with a grenade?
- Yes.
Fire in the hole!
Now we neutralize them.
Kim, over here!
- You're walking towards each other.
- Frederik was hit!
- There's another one here.
- Frederik was hit in the leg.
- who?
- Frederik. He's lying out here.
- who was hit?
- Frederik. He's lying out here.
- Kim ...! Go help Frederik.
- Hold your fire!
- Here we are, Frederik.
- Is that guy dead, or what?
Frederik, if you can limp, then let's get over to that building.
- Super.
- Where to .. .?
- Where to?
- To your right.
Stay here.
I'll take him.
Hey! There's one more here!
And two more over there!
- Easy, easy ...
- They have to fucking die!
- He's already on his way.
- Good job!
- There are three dead over there.
- Move on, Daniel!
They fired from the corner over there.
As soon as we've cleaned up, we ...
5, I've got a hand-grenade.
- I need you to check my arm.
- what the hell ...? Your arm?
Look at this ...
- It was stuck in my soft armor.
- Your soft armor?
- Where precisely?
- Look, it's ...
- And through here. And there.
- Shit.
- Damn, that was crazy!
- Hole is cleaned!
Fucking pigs, man!
- Alright?
- Yes.
Good.
Keep your hand still.
Try holding it upwards.
- 30 seconds ...
- 30 seconds.
- Damn, that was crazy.
- There are five dead in the ditch.
Five dead Taliban right there?
This feels completely surreal.
- Where are those assholes?
- I shot this one in the head.
- Damn, it stinks.
- Shut up.
- Let go of it.
- There's one more.
- Wait a sec. You cover me!
- Of course.
This will be messy. Oh, you went commando, you sick bastard.
- Are those hand guns or magazines?
- He had a pistol apparently.
They already stink.
Kim, if you've tried slaughtering animals, this is no big deal.
That's a bit much, isn't it?
No guns.
It's a good thing they aren't any heavier. what are you packing, buddy?
Okay, get ready to move forward.
How many shots did you fire?
You really went at it.
- Don't they deserve to die?
- Sure. I don't feel sorry for them.
- The water in the stream was red.
- You yelled: "There's no one there."
And we yelled : "Yes, there is!"
Then you figured it out.
It was a ricochet. It nicked me and was stopped there.
I have the bullet in my pocket.
- 40 seconds.
- Pancake! way to go!
- Welcome. We have sodas.
- Sounds good.
Great job.
That was fucking awesome.
- Four of them with a fucking grenade.
- It was nice.
Fuck, that was great.
This is something we'll never forget.
That was some of the best fucking soldiering I've ever seen.
You did a damn good job.
They didn't have any ID or cell phones on them.
I had to pull one of them by the head from under a log.
- He was stuck underneath it.
- Yuck. All the dead Afghans.
Mini, your eyes were huge.
You just stood there staring at them.
The worst thing was with 3.
"They are in the creek."
I didn't believe them, but emptied a magazine down the creek.
"They're still there!"
"No, there's nobody there."
Hand grenade! I came up, there were four of them lying there, rattling.
Then 5 wanted to be in on it, so he emptied a magazine under the log.
- Then Signaler and I found one more.
- Yeah, he said so.
- Not much fun for those Talibobs.
- They were in a bad spot.
Ølby, you say four on the first side?
Plus two more on the other side.
- No, only one.
- There were two. wasn't there one farther along?
When we turned the corner -
- I'm sure we fired at two of them.
- I searched the whole lot.
You went back? Okay. well, no one crawled away after we were there.
Good afternoon.
Everyone's back from the Green Zone.
It was a hectic morning.
I think we all agree on that.
The wounded are doing alright.
I have a fresh update on them.
- Both were operated on.
- Louder!
One of them in the shoulder, the other in the leg.
Grejs says he's sorry he won't be coming back.
He's going back to Denmark for rehabilitation. That's all we know.
You did a good job and showed guts, 2nd platoon.
Today was a close shave.
Anything else?
Have a nice day.
- war booty!
- Loots of war!
Let's start the debriefing.
I want to get through it quickly, and get to the point.
Today we can establish that we didn't fire at each other.
There were many instances, where we were in doubt -
- and mistakes have happened.
I had my doubts that the enemy was only 3 m away.
I hear you hollering that he's close by, and I say "No!"
In the end I was so irritated that I emptied a magazine down the stream.
I thought that would be enough, but you said no -
- and that's when we threw a grenade.
Afterwards Signaler and I -
- found four men groaning heavily in the ditch, feeling rather bad. we liquidated them in the most humane way possible.
5 joined in and fired a magazine under a little bridge -
- and we cleaned the area and found the shooter Ian mentioned.
- He was hit and moaning.
- He was trying to crawl.
- We shot him 30-40 times.
- we finished them off.
- Thanks!
- That was it.
It was fucking awesome.
Not while it was happening -
- but when we got back. Now we've been at war. Now we've tried it.
I never felt that way on patrol before. Normally it's just boring.
But this time I thought -
- there was a real risk of being boxed in.
I never thought that before. we outnumber them -
- and have cool weapons, so they can't touch us. But here they could.
But I'd still like to try it again.
One more time.
I wouldn't.
Think about it! when your tour is over, you'll feel so much better about it.
- Yes.
- It's true.
Making a difference is a cool feeling.
Having been up shit creek will feel great once you're back home.
Imagine if our tour was just a load of crap with nothing going on -
- and only boring patrols.
- It would be a lame way to go home.
- Right. we're gonna see Frederiks' leg.
He has to show us.
- What's up?
- Turn around. way to go, man!
- Good to see you, Grejs.
- You, too.
- So, are you hooked up with Brits?
- They are all bloody Afghans.
- Even some Taliban.
- Really?
Actually, one came in with eyes covered and his hands tied yesterday.
- If you go back inside, we'll come in.
See you inside.
- Hi.
- Good to see you.
- A well-placed shot afterwards.
- Brilliant.
The bullet entered here and was sticking out of my ass.
- They had to dig it out.
- Cool.
I totally forgot about the pain because the chopper flew like this.
I don't know if you heard, but Ølby got four with a grenade.
- They were moaning.
- I don't know how many it killed.
But three of them were lying in a pile.
You could only see an ear and the left side of the head of one of them.
The rest was hanging off him.
Two of them were underneath him.
I thought, "what the fuck?"
They were on top of each other.
Another was under a log, and another was farther away.
- He was crawling on the ground.
- No, he wasn't.
So we hit the jackpot in that ditch.
Okay, guys.
Bye.
I've got two things for you.
You definitely get the Horse.
- Thanks a lot.
- You deserve it.
You fought with us and with Special
Forces. Super ... Damn fine job.
Listen up. I was questioned by the MPs this evening.
Apparently someone called home and told their parents -
- that we liquidated wounded people -
- and piled up the dead, to take pictures of ourselves as heroes.
And that I personally returned and killed some wounded Talibans.
People have also said that we laughed about this during our debriefing.
The parents ... or this mother has contacted Operational Command -
- and asked if that is how we deal with things here.
What bothers me the most right now ...
... is the question of loyalty.
I have to know -
- if anyone here believes that this is what happened.
Does anyone honestly believe that?
Yes .. .?
If I had listened to our debriefing and the sequence of events -
- I would have thought it was extremely ... delicate.
I could understand if outsiders, who weren't there got that impression.
We were still on a high afterwards.
You have to take that into consideration.
It was an extreme experience, so we used extreme words.
If the press makes a case of this, and people think we're psychos -
- well, let them think so.
They weren't there, they didn't see it.
They weren't there, but we know what happened.
Let them talk.
They weren't there.
If they make a case out of this, we'll be suspended -
- and then we'll be blowing bubbles, and that's it until we go home.
And we'll go down in military history, apart from those who knew us -
- as the guys who fucked up.
Anyone who's named in this case -
- including myself,
Daniel and Signaler -
- can look forward to a long session with the whole military circus.
I can't say:
"You weren't there, man" to that.
I believe that Signaler and Daniel had the balls to do the right thing -
- at the right time.
To proceed the way they did with two wounded, one near miss -
- and three men with holes in their uniform and so on ...
To walk up and shoot ... Had I seen movement, I would have fired, too.
And it only took Daniel or Signaler to point under the log and say:
"One here, one there."
That was enough for me to flip to automatic and shoot.
I didn't feel like sticking my head down to someone with a gun.
And yes, it was touch and go.
But in my world you do what you do.
If you have the strength not to shoot -
- because you realise that the movement is not that of a weapon -
- but a surrender or whatever . .. If you have the strength to realise this -
- you don't shoot, of course, but had I been there -
- I would also have fired, and
I did fire, because I wasn't sure.
That was enough for me.
I think it's hard for people at home to understand how ...
- How the decision is made?
- How you can just take a life.
You have to be here to understand it.
This place is whacked, after all.
It's a fucked-up country.
No doubt about it.
People who understand the war itself -
- and how you and I and others feel about being here -
- and making a difference, those people will understand us.
Outsiders might sneer and say that we're insane -
- or that we did something terrible.
I know I did the right thing.
I know we all did the right thing.
In case you don't know, I was questioned by MPs this morning -
- regarding our case with the snitch.
So far it's 'a matter of rumor' -
- which they'll try to quash at battalion level.
So if you hear anything, then dismiss it as a rumor -
- because that's what it is.
So it's just a lot of hot air.
It may come back to haunt us -
- but it is a lot of hot air without any truth in it.
Alright?
That's it.
Good day.
I have a few things to say today.
First of all -
- I'd like to award Silver and Gold
Horses for our recent engagement.
The first two are Joe and Ølby.
Joe and Ølby did something that others might feel differently about.
These guys did it. Five
Taliban were firing at the platoon.
Our guys stormed them with a hand grenade and neutralized them.
This takes courage, and I'm proud of you.
I'm awarding you the Gold Horse, and you both deserve it.
We'll see if it leads to more.
Damn fine job.
Congratulations. well deserved.
And one for you, Joe.
Congratulations.
You deserve it. Give them a hand. what does it say ...?
Smith is a part-time transvestite -
- and a full-time idiot.
Deep thoughts ...
- Not a lot of deep stuff here.
- The deepest was painted over.
The guys were a bit pissed about that.
Of course there was a lot of shit -
- but there's also stuff which ...
Which was quite cool to read.
And it would be cool to see your own stuff, if you came back.
"In the North I know the fairest land.
My people, my home, my native land."
"Denmark."
That was quite poetic.
WELCOM E HOM E
Thanks for your efforts .. .

JeanPierreFinlandais, Jan 30 2011
In winter 2003, French heroine detox drug Subutex had displaced amfetamine as the most popular intravenous drug of Northern Finland
I was living in Rovaniemi without a job
I lived on social welfare and used drugs almost daily
During that time I started to film the life of my social circle
This is a story of my friend Jani
Need to find some (Mazda) 323
If there is no here we can go around from there
Over here.
(Joonas, director:) ... Some guy ...
Hey, did you hear?
(Joonas:) There's some people, did you hear? - I heard. reindeerspotting
ESCAPE FROM SANTALAND
(Jani:) No need to run anymore
Could you help me now please?
I have here sort of car stereo.
Brand is Sony. Wait, I read (the details).
Xplod 4 x 50 W CDX-4000RX.
This is hell of a good Sony car stereo.
Then I would also have money with it
Oh, damn.
Well could you still ask, even if half a dose (puokki) could be found?
You wouldn't happen to be able to help me?
I would only need just one (dose).
(Hurtsi:) You should have fucking taken everything at once, but.
(Jani:) I only took half (a pill/dose),
So I can finish it during night.
Do you think that these won't work?
Fucking sure these will work.
I can swear on my head for that
(Hurtsi:) I did not say that.
- Not then.
(Hurtsi:) There is not enough.
- Yes, there is.
I took the same at
Jonas' place
Initially it seemed, that there is no effect but then all of a sudden it kinda wakes you up
Take it. Try it.
(Hurtsi:) I don't want to.
Well, do not have to then.
(Hurtsi:) Just use all for yourself
Morning.
I just say that is fucking awesome to fuck someone on speed
When you have a girl going down on you, so that it starts to get hard a bit - so you bang her at least three hours nonstop
Fucking really with full power
The girl that kind of rides, that she has never received before.
We continue the trip ...
Fuck off you bitches
I have in fact that kind of asshole radar
With you it starts alarm red
Luckily there comes a time for you to punish
So police officers, rolling slowly on the parking lot checking out register plates
Clouds and those castles made of stone
Spending lonely nights in jails
The active ingredient of Subutex is buprenorphine.
Like heroine and morphine it produces a pleasant and euphoric feeling
(Jani:) I started to use drugs when I was 14 years. old.
About 5 years of drug use and soon
I will turn 20 years.
Since then I've been taking those (notkuja) drugs.
Subutex and Temgesic.
Rovaniemi has been an amphetamine (piri) city fucking long already.
But drugs came here kinda late - but surely, anyway.
We are spending a relaxing night among friend with good food and Subutex
(Jani:) Hey, Hurtsi. How much of
S you have there?
(Hurtsi:) Yeah I have some.
I was thinking if I would have bought half a S from you.
- Would it be okay for you?
- I wouldn't really want to sell.
Sell!
(Jani:) Do not touch with wet hands
Look at it now.
(Hurtsi:) Well. Do you have the money?
(Jani:) No shit, what a guy dude.
Asking me this amount of..
(Jani:) You have to get profit from a friend.
Well it does not matter, fuck.
Fuck what kind of guy that Hurtsi.
Ask 30€ from me (for half) after paying 50€ a chip himself
(Jani:) Is the Dr. Dre the bad guy here? - No. He is the boss here.
Dre is a good man here.
He is a good man here, Dr. Dre here.
Eminem is a crazy gun nut / nutcase here.
(Hurtsi:) Snoopy is just smoking, fuck. And lounging
Well it is just the right thing for Snoopy, fuck (vittu).
Enimem is fuck th best white rapper in the world.
Of course after me even though I cannot rap at all
So what, you are asking for 30€ for the half S?
Yeah.
Hohhoi, fuck.
What a dude
Fuck, whooo, what a friend.
- I also can be irritating sometimes
- Yeah, "sometimes".
Fuck, yeah.
Fuck, all the time, satan.
"All the time, "the fuck?
Take care of the shit as they are supposed to be taken care of.
That is what I have done, satan.
Fucking idiot, bloody hell.
Fuck, dares to ask from me...
Well, it does not matter, fuck.
Due to a "misunderstanding" after a failed job
2 fingers were cut from Jani with an axe
He plans to move away from Rovaniemi
(Jani:) It is all about your psyché how you take your existence here
If you just go to your flat doing nothing and you do not not eat and thus, - and constantly thinks that, fuck,
I am feeling bad, I am feeling bad -
Of course you feel bad.
When you try to be among the living and eat, and so on - then you can cope somehow.
And you are forced to cope.
Rovaniemi, This is this kind of fucking little city (tuppukylä), fuck.
In winter, a lot of snow fuck, and in the summer fucking cold.
What else can you really tell about Rovaniemi?
Here, you have spent your life, -
Months and years just flashing in your eyes.
Yet, they pass fucking slowly.
This is that sort of a place from where you constantly want to leave from
If you've never visited - and lived anywhere else than in Rovaniemi, then fucking hell!
I wouldn't at least have the energy for that
It would be the same as shooting a bullet in the head or something.
This is just too distant.
I would like get into the center of things and activities.
In principle ...
... Eye of the storm.
Due to the raids of the narcotic police
Subutex has temporarily run out from the city
Withdrawal symptoms come
Luckily there is a legal alternative:
Pams (diazepam) and alcohol
I have lost gloves.
Jou, jou, jou...
(Hurtsi:) What is my hat?
Now it is like starting.. the partying
Hurtsi, How much of the diazepams you still have?
- If you could like lend me 5?
- Fuck you!
Was that a direct response or indirect? (Hurtsi:) Think about it.
Well see what the evening brings.
(Announcer :)... Whether Lapin Kansa was faster than Santa Claus this time?
Vili, and then against Lepsu.
Now that is very tight couple.
Huhhahhei and bottle of rum!
But only after work, thank you.
What the fuck is there to see in reindeers?
We checked whether the guy would have wallets...
Oh, fuck.
Oh, my God!
He fell down?
Hey, from where the reindeers start?
(Announcer:) A middle-aged, educated gentleman - is in the army for 24 months.
Think about the neighbor boy from the east (Russia).
He goes to the army, and he never gets back to civilian life.
Now it is tight race.
Now, hard to tell the winner, but soon it will be announced.
Indeed, there is Veikka with the information
Information finale ...
(Jani's friends are singing
Pelle Miljoona's song [Moottoritie on Kuuma]:)
I would like to explain but the ships wait
You are a dream to me but the world is true
But the world is true
Cocaine, LSD, Ecstasy, yep
Always fresh Koskenkorva tastes as a snack
Too much, just a bit too much
I eat mushrooms
Too much, just a bit too much
I calm down with pills
Every night, when too much I fell in love
Life of an artist,
Me, Melleri and Morrison
(Jupe:) You!
(Jani:) What?
What did he say?
Call in ten minutes!
I heard today that you have called me a homerobber!
Nonsense. We settled this yesterday, when I was here.
We agreed that it is settled.
- I heard about it today.
So from whom? - What fucking difference it is from whom I heard it from?
Fuck him, who is saying those things
Why in the fuck have you said such thing?
Well you could have stolen all my stuff if you'd have wanted to.
Well you blamed me. That I would had used your drugs (töötit) as well. satan.
Haven't we already talked about this?
- Yeah.
So why do you blame a homerobber? - I do not blame you.
You have accused me as a homerobber.
- I do not accuse you as such.
You have accused! - What is coming from my mouth?: "I don't accuse".
Just to piss you off.
I don't have the energy for this. - You have accused me to be a homerobber.
(Jani:) Fuck believe, fuck, who you believe, satan.
Hey, if Joni told that to me ...
You heard me?
- I heard you.
I have fuck, in a fit of anger, fuck - might have said, when the drugs had disappeared.
But I did not mean it.
We settled this yesterday evening?
I did not know yesterday evening - that you had called me a homerobber.
I might have said in a fit of anger - when the drugs (töötit) disappeared.
But I don't mean that really.
I'll trust you
100%, fuck.
And still accuse me of being a homerobber.
Fuck, if that is your decision, we are out of here.
I have not called anyone a homerobber.
You have.
In a fit of anger
I might have said - but we settled this yesterday.
- I just heard it.
I've said it when fuck, - when I was equally furious as I going to be soon fuck.
I'm getting pissed of this as well.
- Do you think that I am not pissed off because of this?
You have accused me of being a homerobber.
I thought of you as a my mate.
I do not think you as homerobber fuck.
I really do not.
Well, why do you say that then?
- I might have said, in a fit of anger.
You can also in a fit of anger say - if you get angry at me, fuck I will kill that Raappana.
But in the end you do not mean it.
I've never said anything even close to that
- But you might. It is a metaphor.
In similar fashion
I might have said, -
That fuck, satan, Jupe, is a homerobber, perkele!
But still I haven't really meant it.
Okay.
- It was a misunderstanding.
Really if I hear that kind of matter ...
You do not really hear that. You are one of the three here that I trust on.
But if I once again hear...
I guarantee that you will lose rest of your fingers also.
Joni doesn't have anything to drink.
Where is Joni?
- At Vilsu's place.
Where does Vilsu live?
- There where the Kansankatu's Neste is (gas station).
I go and get it.
You ain't go going anywhere with a car
- I have a stolen car out there
You are not going anywhere with a car!
- I drove it here just a while ago.
Despite that!
- I am in good condition
You are not going to drive!
I'll go drive a car.
I go and do some fucking crazy job
Burglary to a storage of an industrial area fails when the cops arrive to the place
POLICE
Jani is being arrested for 3 days.
Three days of controversy.
Let's go somewhere for a cup of coffee.
- I lost the laptop.
I ain't giving as I only have that one
- Oh, fuck, you promised earlier.
I said that if you had not taken any,
I could offered you one.
But you already had taken one
- Yeah, but I was so sick yesterday.
I knew you that if I could keep a cool face
I would be out there in 3 days.
And I would even have
Subutex (teemuja) waiting for me.
That there is nothing to worry about here.
They can keep me arrested for 3 days and not a day longer
(Joonas:) And you denied everything?
- I admitted the attempt of theft.
However the limit of grand theft was passed, - when the guy got loose and got the goods with him
It was not completely useless thing as
I benefited about 1000€ from that.
(Joonas:) Good one.
On that station you have to be quiet always, when you are there
After the first hearing report -
I just said that: "Nothing to add nor to nothing to tell."
(Police) "You take that line?"
Jani: I take this line, fuck.
Today the examiner was changed.
Initially it was Jani Pääkkönen, who changed to Risto Turunen.
Turunen said: "Raappana.
Name the other guy now."
"Together it is done and together it is suffered"
It does not really work so, it is kinda tacit agreement
If someone gets caught, he will take the blame.
Now, it happened to be me.
Fuck, loyalty to the another guy
Here you keep your mouth shut.
Nothing much else about it
To control the Subutex problem, the addicts are offered a free sedative medication
(Jani:) Could you give water or something?
Or will these go with tea?
They are not needed, satan, to be put down with anything.
Just on top of the tongue to saviour the flavour.
(Joonas:) Nami Nami (Yummy yummy).
They go down like that if you haven't got them for some while
Ten pills in the mouth at the same time and suck.
Pam (Diapam, diazepam) is the best tasting medicine, that I know.
Yeah, if you start comparing the different tastes.
Well, no, Rivatril is better.
Fuck, it is number one.
Rivas are fucking good.
They will leave a taste which is a mixture of liquorice and ... mint.
Like you would have eaten a candy.
(Joonas:) I think the best are Tenox (temazepam) pills.
They taste like chalk tablets.
(Joonas:) No, they taste like sweets.
Just try Rivatril.
Riva is fucking good.
Yes, but there is the chalk flavor in Tenox which I do not like that much.
Oh, and then it gets all mushy in your mouth.
Pams dissolve nicely, like layer by layer.
All the time that kind of hard chunk.
At the department (hospital?) the people wonder - when I am so spaced out in the morning
- that what I am really taking.
I guess I'm a bit spaced out, when I take 40 mg of Tenox (temazepam) -
200 mg Sparine (promazine) and fuck what all else.
And I still cannot sleep.
So I guess I am a bit spaced out in the morning
Fuck, that annoyed me.
(Hurtsi:) Sparine makes you quite spaced out.
And when you're not sleeping - even though you are on such drugs, that even an apartment building should fall.
Eyes just are gaping open.
Sick, fuck.
(Joonas:) Why could not you sleep?
The withdrawal symptoms were so strong.
I was just unable to sleep.
Court house
Prosecutor have demanded for a prison sentence to Jani. He is waiting for the court solution.
Drunken driving and
Endangering traffic - a couple of thefts, drug crimes drug use crimes - and more of the shit.
Bit of everything.
If I would go to prison now,
I would go to Oulu.
In Pelso Prison you would have to work.
And if you do not, then cell door is closed.
Oulu: that is like a rest home.
A lot of go just to spend their winter there, - when you get shelter for the winter and regular food.
To go there to sit a bit.
(Jani:) The family is still the dearest to me.
It is pretty much the only sacred thing in my life.
Where other people can not reach.
And to where they have no business.
They do not know anything about that.
But it is irritating for my mom to be here, if... she has that kind of weigth over here, so it's not good.
Those older people have the habit - of blaming themselves for their children's mistakes.
I started stealing fucking young.
Now, I have become quite of master in it.
As a kid you only stole candy or something like that.
It was quite stupid back then
When you started to proper thefts, you did not think of the money - but the excitement and feeling what you will get from it.
Adrenaline rush of its own kind.
Useless to think about it anymore.
You have chosen your lifestyle
I just hope to get on a trip fast.
I just want to get out from here.
As fast as possible.
But I should get some money.
That is the problem.
(Alert:) Solution at Hall 2
What ...
(Joonas:) What is the situation there?
They sentenced me to jail.
(Joonas:) What?
- Sentence to jail.
District court sentences Jani to jail for a year.
The sentence will be put in order in summer.
- Whassup, whassup?
- Let's go and do (iv) drugs (töötit).
Ah drugs? Then I get the fuck out from this gang.
(Jani -> buddy:) Could you borrow me 50€?
At the moment I do not have a penny of money.
The money that I will receive will go all to those costs/charges.
This is running very well!
Well it is 2 gig PC.
What game is that?
- Night Fire, James Bond.
Fuck, the phone rings.
Fuck the debts are putting pressure on me.
I should quickly get 60€ from somewhere.
(Ahi:) How can I live - if the Social Welfare Office gives me 80€? I can't life with that
I do not start to live with my woman's money, that is a sure thing.
Oh, What will I do?
If I mean to live,
I then have to steal.
That is where it goes again that I am in prison again, thank to you.
(Jani:) You cannot blame anyone for that.
(Jani.) You wanted to get a break from every day life, in principle.
When you discovered your own thing, it was fucking awesome.
If you take Subutex, initially, very first times - you get into that kind of state of trance.
You can travel anywhere in your mind
And when daydreaming (lucid dreams), you see just what you want to see.
You are awake, but still you are like sleeping.
You dream while you are awake.
It is fucking awesome.
To your whole body, you get that kind of fucking good feeling.
I cannot, satan, explain.
It is just, fuck ...
But now, in the long run you are not noticing them anymore.
I was at once addicted to morphine as well.
When you took it for a couple of days, - then suddenly you had been taking it one week and two weeks.
Mind was all flat.
You weren't thinking anything at all.
It was, fuck, so evil a substance, that you will die to it.
At least to it if not to anything else
During the spring the use of drugs is increasing
Jani's debt. He tries to get some money.
The date of jail time is getting closer day by day.
Howdy ho!
The one syringe ...
Another thing is whether they are mine.
Hey, now I got a murky flashback.
Fuck, it is quite sticky. Yuck.
Party, party.
When you draw through the filter, so the chalk does not come there.
That is why today I draw my Subutex and other IV drugs through a filter.
Chalk is fucking bad for your blood vessels and your eyes.
You might start too to see kind of blurry.
Do you still get returns from it?
This is, fuck, a dream place.
Well, and still a second round.
That certainly all the shit has been used.
Hey, everybody!
It's a nice day today!
It's a shining day, and summer's coming.
Yeah.
You have a car, right?
- Yeah.
You have syringes+needles?
- No we have none.
Are you under Pams (sedatives)?
- No ...
I have stayed up whole the last night, taking amphetamine.
2.5 grams of amphetamine.
Took amphetamine all night long.
Now Mika went back over there.
(Joonas:) Oh, back to jail?
- Yeah.
(Joonas:) How long has he left?
He sits how long of his sentence?
Can you give me the phone,
I will call to Kymis?
Everyone owes me money.
- I soon start to beat up people.
- I do not owe you any money.
Then they, fuck, are crying to me:
"we do not get money from anywhere".
Now would be sitution when if we had the bazooka.
(Joonas:) What?
If we had the bazooka, - it would happen as we talked about yesterday.
... Pay me the debt in cash.
- Yes, but to me you could not.
Let's go to the drugstore.
Family package of syringes and 20 ...
(Joonas:) What? - Cups, which
I can use it with a filter to draw that Subutex.
No.
Is someone watching me?
Is someone watching me?
(Joonas:) Yes.
(Joonas:) Now.
Family package of syringes.
And 20 that kind of cups.
Or give just 10 in matter of fact.
Need syringes and needles?
- Yeah, five both of them.
To the whole family.
To father, mother and to three children.
And a small bag for them, thank you.
- 2.70€? Well then it is even.
Thank you. There you go. Need a receipt?
- Not needed, I go to use drugs.
Can you hold that? Fuck.
Calm driving style, we are not in a rush to anywhere.
(Joonas:) What?
- I said to Jani.
Jani perhaps should drive a bit more calmly.
We are seriously not in a rush to anywhere.
(Jani:) It is quieter?
(Joonas:) What?
Calmer than this? (Joonas:)
Just normally. (shout)
(Joonas:) Well that is what I meant.
I am driving, fuck, as usual.
Reflexes were in order, so the bitch survived.
(Jani:) It is all about your psyché how you take your existence here
You cannot end your use here.
All your friends use - and if you're a a while without drugs then someone will offer you.
And when you ask yourself, it is sure that you will not be offered.
The people here are so crooked/twisted that the fucking hell ...
You cannot distinguish friend from your enemy.
The next day he can be your enemy.
I guess you become like that as well as the others.
I do not know - whether or not my friends have gone, fuck, anywhere outside this city.
They are trying to get out from here, it is evident.
And a big part people have gone.
But they won't leave as I would leave.
They still will stay in Finland.
But I wouldn't be able even to stay in Finland.
Two weeks later Jani calls and says:
"Pack your stuff, we leave in an hour"
I have been waiting fucking long for this moment.
Yesterday I succeeded in sort of thing that I comment on here -
But that can I say that
But we can get going!
I am feeling so good, aren't you also??
Fucking awesome! Throw a couple of Pams to your face to relieve a bit your tension.
Or Rivatril. Take one Pam.
(Joonas:) I'll take couple of lines.
You fuck head.
Today we are in Finland.
Tomorrow we are in Paris.
Jani has managed to steal 5'000€ from the safe of a local supermarket. He plans to escape from Finland with this money.
Nothing can go wrong anymore.
(Joonas:) What were you afraid before?
That I would manage to get caught before we were able to go.
It takes as long as for us as want to spend on the road.
I will spend at least as long as we have the money.
And it won't be a problem to get more money.
If the money runs out, then we go to work.
I believe that I will stay on this trip.
I just have a backpack of clothes, as you can see.
Backbag full of clothes.
And in the wallet about
20'000 of old money (~3'600€)
About.
Now we are in Stockholm.
I've never been so far from my home
Fuck hello what a place!
This train station ... fuck ... Whooo.
This is the size of Rovaniemi.
That much I can say..
Let's go up there.
Things could not be any better, damn it!
We're are in Copenhagen tomorrow morning.
Walking at 07h inside to Christiania, fuck.
Marijuana smell starts to come on your face.
I will smoke a massive joint, unbelievable 'flowerpuffs'.
Bevar Christiania
= Save Christiania
Fuck, we are now in free area.
Everyone knows each other.
They are just saying hello to each other.
Have smoked already morning joints and go with smiles on their faces
This is a fucking awesome place! Fuck!
I want to live here.
Really.
Would they let me build my own little cottage?
Greetings to the police of Rovaniemi.
You fuck heads.
(Jani:) Not like I have anything in Rovaniemi any longer.
There is something like materialistic, but like ...
My family has split up.
Mother drinking.
I love them all, but I have my life.
We are just in
20 minutes in Paris.
Fuck, and an hour from that,
I will get Subutex.
I haven't taken any for four days.
But yes, it hasn't really mattered.
There has been enough of eyecandy and all other fun stuff.
But we are like fifteen minutes from Paris.
To control to severe heroine problem the state of France provides free Subutex treatment for the addicts
Some of them sell their Subutex to buy stronger drugs like heroine and crack
We have arrived to the source of illegally sold Subutex in North Europe
I want a room for two and TV.
Two people, one TV?
What does she say?
Not even a fuck comes out of this, let's take some other hotel.
I want to take Subutex!
Understand English?
I want a fix.
Pretty shitty, but it does not matter. Close the door.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Subutex is here.
8 mg packet, no VAT.
Pull out the cap.
Then the pump.
Then pretty generous.
Needle, out. Water.
Underpressure. Mixing a little.
Then loose a bit. Then
The needle to the head, then mix and consume.
And you are ready to enjoy!
The big bed is for me by the way.
Look at these!
Voila!
How long does it take, that it begins to work? - About 5 minutes.
But it started already to affect as immediately I started to feel good.
Well, what could be better?
We're in Paris.
There's so fucking much of Subutex.
Show them, to all the people.
And I am here watching television here.
Gradually begin to feel the effect.
And smoking a cigarette.
By the way I have also marijuana.
Flower. I will show you that too.
Woody, slash, flower, slash, weed.
Samba, samba, leeo.
Fuck, I have been waiting for this, fuck ... Let's say a .. lifetime.
Soon I take another shot.
Whooo.
We are now, fuck, like at the core.
This is like being in the United States.
Whooo.
I just went to the top of the Eiffel Tower restroom to take a shot of Subutex.
And I filmed everything on tape.
(Sings Elvis
Only You song.)
(Jani:) Yes i had my mouth wide open when we came here.
The amount of people and the fact that the streets, they are somehow ...
Like even this little street, full of life.
In Rovaniemi, during this time, fuck, would be dark and quiet.
Like you notice you start comparing everything to Rovaniemi.
That thought I would like to remove.
The memories of the shitty times in Rovaniemi are fading away to the passic scenes of the South
The use of drugs is increasing day by day
First class!
First class!
Window seats!
I can not help laughing, we had such a good luck.
With 100€ an awesome hotel room.
And seaside views.
Soon you cannot even see the shore.
Now is time for Subutex.
And for you, time for lines.
Since getting off from the ship, almost one disc of Subutex used.
(Joonas:) Here?
- Yes. 3.. 2 short of full  disc.
This is pretty much the coolest a place where I have visited.
Where are we now?
Well, I do not remember.
Cefalu.
- Yes.
In cases like that
Subu takes your memory.
To things like that it affects fucking much.
May go, fuck, like one and a half years, you use it all the time, then nothing.
And then after the 1.5 years you try to take for example a pause of 1 week.
You have been 4 days without, and you start thinking about all sorts of things.
Like what have you done during last year and half.
But you can not remember.
Everything is all a fog to me.
I am so pissed off now, that I've been using here as well.
And a lot more for example that I used in Rovaniemi.
Tolerance is fucking high.
If I now want to quit - half a Subu won't ease a lot.
And I did not look for anything other than this trip itself...
Which is just fucking cool.
Actually those Subus could have been dropped also.
I could have used all the money just for this trip.
Just to buy one box.
Fuck, would have managed with it the amount you would have wanted to manage  - and stopped the drug use during this journey.
That would have emphasized the message.
There is more in the world than just to take drugs, fuck.
Itching in the nose.
Hey, I start doing lines now.
(Joonas:) Well?
- Yeah. Now starts.
Do you know what this
Raappana (his lastname) is doing now?
Throws syringes a side and will never use them ever again.
Radical cecision but this is how it is ...
(Joonas:) You really mean so?
Unusable!
I stopped injecting to veins.
The last traces were now left of this trip.
I've taken the last IV drug dose here at the shores of the Sicilian sea.
(Jani:) In addition to traveling -
I have seen myself living right in Spain.
I go to Spain,
I have an own house, a wife, - a bit of field (for agriculture).
I would be working, the wife would be maybe at home. A couple of children. That kind of things.
I 'm already up here, - so I would say that
50% of the dream is true already.
Uijui, I am tempted for one shot of Subu.
Weird feeling.
Doesn't feel like sniffing any lines, as it is stinging fucking weirdly.
Is not it ...
Yes, I still prefer to be without.
Fuck, if I could decide,
I would ban Subutex.
Or the abuse of Subutex.
Let's put it this way.
Or well.. I don't know.
So that no one would take them first.
Except some heroine addicts, who really need it - just so that they can normalize their lives.
But, like for myself
I do not recommend it.
I will quit.
I won't use it anymore, fuck.
It is as fucking simple as that.
Or not that simple. it is rather complex, but still I will do it and quit.
(Joonas:) Why do you want to quit? - Fuck, I do not know, fuck.
It might improve my own quality of life.
Look, what a fucking advertisement pub.
Club for the elderly, fuck, that kind.
Meant for those with career.
Look at the ads - and drink a couple of drinks. Fuck,
Just put more Gucci on you.
Fucking weirdos, satan.
What the fuck! (Mitä vittua?)
Now change the side, fuck!
Hell no..
That is some fucking nudist.
In Rovaniemi, like that Maire ...
She often, satan, home-brewed beer mug in hand, - naked at Samppari, but
Rovaniemi is quite ...
But fuck at night in Rome fuck we run across satan fuck some fucking nudist fuck nudist ...
Whooo, you can just laugh about it.
While wandering in the streets of Rome
I receive a text message to my phone:
"Fuck tell that Jani to contact me or I bash your appartment to pieces with an axe."
This is Jani.
Hello, Hello.
You were trying to reach me.
You were trying to reach me.
I haven't just been able to call you.
So. Haven't the money or other.
What else is happening there?
Who took it?
Who took the car?
I knew that I shouldn't have called, satan, at all.
Would be easier to be ignorant.
Not to care what happens elsewhere.
And you, fuck, even do not care.
That is why I paid all my debts, everything - so that here I would not have to stress about it, - that I have debt collectors after me and other shit.
So now some fucking Kuoksa ...
Oh, fuck I am irritated now!
That was the last option
To make that call, fuck.
If the cops are listening to
Pia's phone -
Now they know that I am in Italy.
Yeah, right, and now I have to be accountable to Kuoksa - for such a car, that I do not even have anymore.
I am not excited.
Not at all, fuck, not at all.
They think that they can somehow control me - but fuck, no fucking way.
Fucking no way.
There, satan, damn and let 'em get me here.
This is annoying in a way that, - that if you ever been involved in something - that would be kind the rest of your life, fuck.
Due to confusing chain of events in Rovaniemi,
Jani is again in debts and his friend has been threatened
But I guess he realizes that if I had been the snitch, -
I would have never got this far.
But that it that what he considers to be what ...
It is a different matter.
The way, how these fingers went, is a different matter.
I myself offered my fingers to them.
As a compensation.
So that is the difference.
In my opinion it is big but.
I was, like, hit me, if it makes you feel any better.
I do not know.
We arrive to Spain
Today, I haven't taken a single dose of drugs.
Oh, bloody hell, I was boiling this morning.
I almost lost my nerves and ultimately
I lost my nerves.
(Joonas:) Well, why was that? - Started to be really pissed, as there was no drugs.
Really pissed off.
Fuck
(Jani:) Then when I got an own, fuck, small house and, fuck, my own field - and so on ... that would be the center of my world.
We are now on the African side, in a Spanish town.
And there it is now.
This is the high quality shit.
From there when you smoke a puff,
I will say ...
Check it out now. Fuck, I say, that hello, hello, hello!
We have smack, smack, smack ...
'Horse' (polle, slang term for heroine).
(Joonas:) So why do you want to try?
Fuck, Wonder why?
(Joonas:) Huh?
- I do not know, just to try it.
(Joonas:) I mean why? - I guess want to try heroine.
(Joonas:) But why? - I do not know. I want the feeling (notkut).
(Jani:) It's hard to change way of life or lifestyle.
To change it completely.
It does not happen overnight.
You have to want it yourself, more than anything else.
And not, fuck, fear and run away.
For that reason many good things have been ruined.
I will build a small cottage for myself somewhere over to the green fields.
Field (agricultural) behind it.
And in front of it that kind of wooden fence.
Behind of it that kind
2m high stone fence.
I have a wife, and - not that much money, so quite a modest life, but - everyone are happy - and I go some little job - five days a week.
That's how I see my self.
I would then no longer exist,
I would be someone else.
Reality.
You mean, this is the real world?
I never thought of that.
My mother and I, we had a house in Chicago.
We figured... we'd get out of there, you know, while the getting's good.
And so, then when I got to Vernon...
I called up these real estate people.
They sent me their phone number.
So then I see the picture.
The property was $2,200.
Of course, it was cheap.
They claim it was too much.
Well, it wasn't too good.
It wasn't a castle... but it was a house. Five lots.
So, okay, bought it.
Had a mortgage for four years, paid off... so I don't have to pay no rent, see?
No taxes.
Old age?
No taxes.
You gotta like outdoor sports.
And I've always loved it.
Especially turkey hunting.
I killed my first turkey when I was 10 years old.
I can't tell you how many I've killed, but I've killed a lot of them.
I run a business. I close the business down if I have to... to go turkey hunting.
It's just something that I like.
It's just in me.
I can't tell you how I feel.
It's just a hell of a sport, that's all.
Sometimes you can be standing around and hear one jar the ground.
And you just look at the roads and fire trails... untiI you pick up fresh tracks and know which way he's going.
And just go to that area, stop, listen... and hope that you hear one.
Sometimes they gobble quite often, early.
Sometimes it's 5, 10, 15 minutes.
And later on in the morning, sometimes it's every 30 minutes.
You just can't tell.
They're a smart bird.
The smartest we got in this country.
See now, we spend time like this day in and day out... and not hear nothing.
But you know they're here.
I sent them two checks.
One check for $12, a three-year membership... and $3 insurance.
So I waited. I don't know,
I waited a month or longer... and I didn't get no answer from them.
So then I had this lady copy the checks, you know, on the copier?
So then I sent the copies to them, and now they sent me the jeweI, see?
I don't know if the jewel is genuine or not. Take a look.
I don't know what I'm looking for.
I don't know.
What does a jeweler look for?
You know, those guys, when you go into a jewelry store?
If you want something examined, they look through a lens.
What are they looking for?
You ask them, they'd go...
You ever seen a man's brains?
I've seen them.
I've picked them up, scooped them up.
Put them in, do them up like brains.
You buying brains?
But there's a ball right here, and there's a ball here.
A ball here and a ball there.
Now, they're connected to the spine, the spine goes down the backbone.
And if all four... of these balls or brains is functioning... you're not a one-track mind.
You're a four-track mind.
And you can...
I've seen a lot of folks.
They can type one letter...
Write me a letter and you a letter on a typing machine.
And write one way with this hand... write your letter with this hand, and my letter with that one.
And I can take a penciI and sit down and write...
"cat shit" with this hand and "dog shit" with that one.
Both at the same time.
Two pencils.
I've done that lots of times.
These brains...
Now, what I was telllng you... if I can't stand up...
I don't believe, without propping against something.
It gets me out of balance.
There you go. You run one...
Now, if you ain't got that... and I've often, all over this town, time and again... pointed out to anybody that would listen.
If you run that foot in a circle this way, and then your hand that way... then just pick up your pistol and keep wiggling your arm... and singing a song.
That's four, in other words, that's five things.
That's five things I can do on this.
On one, with this old knot up here.
Good tire.
Vernon-30 to ControI.
Go ahead.
Quincy, can you give me the correct 10-36?
By my watch it's getting to 17.:31.
That's a big 10-4. Appreciate it.
We don't have too much traffic coming through now.
Sit here, watch them come shooting off the end of that bridge a little bit.
About the only thing I do this time of day... sit around and wait.
You have to do this in a hurry... because you have to cover several places at one time.
Not at one time, but... as quick as you can, because theygobblE better... earlier part of the morning.
The later in the morning it gets, the less theygobblE.
So you usually kill by...
6:00, 7:00 at the latest.
There's been a lot killed after that.
That's the cream of the hunt.
From daylight to 6:00, 7:00.
He's looking for a fresh track now... and if he finds a fresh track, he'll stop, listen, and go in on it.
That's what he's doing.
Walking and listening, right now.
Looking for a fresh sign he's crossed the graded road.
Where there's smoke, there's fire, you know.
You find a fresh track, you know there's agobblEr there...
'cause this is a prime area for turkey.
Look how that's bogged down there.
Bogged an inch deep there in that dirt.
He weigh 18, 20 pounds.
Look at the size of the track.
Look how he's bogging up that hard dirt.
He probably crossed late yesterday afternoon... and roosted right back down here in these woods.
If he's got a hen with him, it's very hard to call him away from that hen.
You can believe that.
Anybody that'll tell you they can... call agobblEr away from a pack of hens, just anytime...
Did you hear that?
Sounds almost like a turkey gobbling, but it's not.
It's one of them big woodpeckers pecking.
FooI you a lot of times.
Occasionally, you'll call a biggobblEr... away from some hens... but very seldom.
I'd rather not even try to call one away.
Well, you always try, but you can't do it.
I never have.
Very seldom.
I have different areas
I like to sit around and wait.
I sit here a lot of times.
Since this car was sitting around so much... a lot of people, they don't know for sure... if we have a police officer on duty here or not.
I can sit here and catch a lot of them as they come across the bridge... or come down through town.
Like this tanker.
He sounds like he's getting on it now.
Try to hold them down.
I hate to have to get out and chase every one of them down... but I try to let them see me sitting here.
So then, if I have to write them up... it's their own fault, because they can see me sitting here.
I'm not trying to hide now.
But there is a few places I sit around where you can hardly see me.
That's for my radar gun, when I have it.
I don't have it with me today.
I had to send it back in and get it recertified.
So I'm waiting for it to get back here.
It should be in Friday or Saturday... and then I can sit out here and catch a bunch of them.
They said he was 65 years old.
I don't know about that now.
That's a long life for a mule.
But he eventually died.
They rooted him over into that pond.
Just an old skeleton Iying there with the hide all on him.
Just as tough as anything you ever seen.
And a big hole in his throat here... where the buzzards and things had eaten... every bit of him as they could.
They couldn't eat him all.
I was a-fishing in there one day... and dropped my bait down there at that hole... that old mule laying in there, you know, all puffed up.
Dried up on the skeleton.
And there was a big warmouth perch run out him up here and bit my hook.
Took it in, that old mule, that quick, you know?
And he got off of there. Got loose.
I went to pull the hook out... and I must have hung it on one of his ribs in there.
I had to break it off.
But I put on another hook... and dropped it down there and I caught a big one.
The bones had come out of his legs, the skin was laying there.
And it was tough as a bear.
I got over, it was about this deep in the water.
I went down and then got a hold of them legs... and drug that old mule out on the hill.
There was 114 warmouth in him, warmouth perch.
I could hear them a-fluttering just 'cause I run out on the hill with it.
The water run out of him.
I could hear them a-fluttering in there.
It was in planted pines.
But he'd roosted in a branch, the other side of planted pines.
I eased into a row of planted pines, you know.
Planted pines.
They're not exactly in a straight row like that.
They'll be, you know, offset.
So you got a variation about 2 foot, maybe.
And getting in planted pines,
I walked across the rows... crossways to the rows, till I got right even... with where he was at in the swamp.
And I knew. I said, "Right yonder he's at. "
I walked crossways to the rows till I got to that row.
I knew he was right at the end of it.
I was working my way in and out.
And I slipped up there.
I slipped up close enough to the branch.
I could see the turkey in a pine tree.
He was a-gobbling.
I got to that pine, and I looked.
It was about 30 foot over there to that other pine.
And it was about 25 to 30 foot more to the turkey.
I looked at that turkey, and I looked at that open spot.
I said, "There ain't no way
I can get no further. "
I just eased that gun up reaI slow behind them pines.
And eased down.
And, lo... there he is, right there. I think he's got about an 11-inch beard.
He hit the ground.
It sounded like a ton of bricks.
Now, this here is a gopher.
He's not a turtle.
He's harmless. He won't bite you.
I don't know just how come him to be way down in here.
He don't like this kind of land here.
It's a high, dry, sandy land for him.
And he'll dig his den to be as far as...
20 feet deep sometimes.
And he's good to eat, too.
I don't eat him, but people do eat him.
He's just a fine piece of meat for the dining table.
I believe he wants to walk now.
His motor's slow-paced.
I said, "Y'all just leave my gun here.
I got to use the bathroom.
"You've got to come back this same way. "
And they said, "Yeah. All right. "
I got my gun.
I didn't get to use the bathroom, though. I was fixing to... but right out in them pines
I heard onegobblE.
And they'd done left.
And I said, "My God. "
Boy, that's the best diarrhea medicine in the world.
You hear a turkeygobblE, you forget all about diarrhea and everything.
Headaches, everything.
That'd cure anything.
I grabbed my gun, and I tore out.
I must have went a quarter of a mile.
Went through a bunch of pines.
And he double-gobbled.
I knew right then that I had a pretty good chance of killing him.
Man, it hadn't been 30 minutes since one had been killed.
Bless your heart. The next time hegobblEd, there he was.
Right out there in that wiregrass and broom-sage.
I just yelped reaI low to him.
HegobblEd.
He was coming straight towards me.
He wasn't walking. He wasn't running.
It was sort of in a little fast trot.
I had a good blind in some palmettos.
I was sitting behind some palmettos.
I done had my gun on him.
When he got up there... he was walking a little too fast to shoot him, 'cause I wanted a sure shot.
And what I done, I just whistled.
And he stopped, and he looked... and when he looked up, that was the end of it.
That's him right there in the middle.
With about an 11-inch beard.
Now, this opossum.
I didn't catch him myself.
Another fellow did.
He was eating his chickens.
He caught him, and he brought him down here to me.
He said I was the only fellow that knew what to do with an opossum.
I'm gonna keep him for the fun day in Wausau... and sell him to the fellows.
They auction them off over there from $1,200 to $1,500.
That's a great price for an opossum, don't you know?
I'll put him back?
You've got to be carefuI with one of them things.
They'll bite you.
I've been bit by them.
I've been bit by everything there is in the country.
Wild game, you know.
Except a rattlesnake.
I was sure enough watching for him.
He just walked.
No rain in it. Got to looking.
And his track was in that track, that trailer track...
We had just talked to the man five minutes behind us.
The trailer made a track. We come out the same way he come in.
And you know, that's got to be a red-hot track...
'cause it's on top of that trailer track.
You understand what I'm saying?
We just talked to him behind us.
He's right out here.
Stepped outside, yelped one time, and he come right back, gobbling.
We started grabbing guns and getting into position.
And I told Snake. I says, "Snake...
"that turkey's not coming back across that road.
"There ain't no way he's coming back across that road.
"He's going the other way. "
We'd sit there and we'd yelp to him.
And he'dgobblE.
He'd go over this way, and he'dgobblE.
Go back that away, and he'dgobblE.
He wanted us to come on.
But we wasn't going on.
We was expecting him to backtrack.
And I told Snake he wouldn't backtrack and come back to us.
This went on for about half an hour.
I told Snake. I said, "I'm tired of this.
I'm gonna Kill that turkey. "
I yelped one time. And he double-gobbled.
And that's all I yelped.
And the next thing you know, here he comes.
Just gobbling all the way.
I shot him and he hit the ground.
I mean he was doing a da-do, bouncing around about 3, 4 foot high.
I run down there to pick him up, and he got up.
He had a broken wing, and I knocked him down.
I said, "God, he's fixing to get away. "
And I just tried to shoot his head.
I just shot a big old hole in the ground.
I missed his head, 'cause if I'd shot the whole turkey, he'd be in pieces.
And I missed him. He got out. He was going right down the pine run... and I said, "Well, one more shot. "
And I shot him and just rolled him over.
And it was cloudy, like I said.
During all this time and around in them pines, everything looks alike.
To me it does. Anybody else that's ever been in there...
You can't... Excuse me.
You can't tell where you're at.
I got in there.
And when I Killed the turkey...
I didn't know where I was at, you know.
I walked around.
I got lost.
I was hollering for Snake.
I'd walk the direction I thought it was.
I was going in the right direction. But in them pines, everything looks alike.
And I started hollering, "Snake," just as loud as I could.
And they know I was turned around.
And they sat up there just laughing like the devil at me.
And they wouldn't answer me or nothing.
But anyway, I drug that one out the next morning... after them two mornings before.
There his beard is.
About the same length.
About an 11-inch beard.
The one on the far right here.
Thirty-five, 40 years ago there weren't no wigglers.
These wigglers is kind of a new thing in this country.
These wigglers have been in here about 20-something years.
These wigglers is a new thing come in here.
I reckon they was here... but I don't know where they accumulated from.
I got the seed of these from
South Florida. That's where I got them.
This is not a regular wiggler...
Like everybody's got here.
This here is what they call an orchard-worm wiggler.
That's the reason people come here and wants to beat me out of them.
I don't know where all this water comes from.
You must have a lot of ditches up there.
Of course, if you're taking the history of Vernon... well, I can't tell you.
All I can tell you about the river is... somebody told me that boats used to come down here.
And I says, "That river must have been wider, you know. "
The creek they call it.
But they said no.
So, I mean, freight boats used to come down here.
Justlike freight on the Mississippi River.
But I don't know.
I can't figure it out.
Maybe they used big canoes.
There's a big red wiggler.
There's a wiggler that they call the eel worm.
And this orchard-worm wiggler.
Then they got a big ring-neck wiggler.
And then they got one they call the night crawler.
He weighslike that.
I've got some of them from up in Joplin, Missouri... and brought them down here.
They up there.
I brought up down here and put them in a little old bed I had yonder.
And they all left.
They crawI at night.
You can't keep them in a place.
They stay around in the edge of the swamp.
Out there, there's a lot of muddy water.
That reminds me of the story about the two sailors.
They were looking at the water and one says:
"It's a lot of water out there. "
And the other guy says,
"Yeah, that's just the top of it. "
Hey, those snakes out here, they can swim.
Be careful of that.
Those snakes can crawl over water like they're crawling over the ground.
My.
And some people, they says,
"You going swimming?"
You're swimming around, and then you look up... and you see this snake coming towards you. Oh, brother!
See that jump?
You know what kind of fish that was?
That could have been a garfish.
Usually, the garfish, they feed on top... and if there's little minnows on the top, they snap them up.
You ever see a garfish?
He's got a blLI aboutlike that, his nose.
And when he...
He usually catches what he goes after.
I've never studied no book on these wigglers.
What I know about them is just self-experience.
They got books on them, but them books is wrong.
They don't teach you right on them.
Teach you what kind of feed to feed them.
How to do them and all that.
And it's all wrong in my book.
Why he wanted to take his shoe off to pull the trigger, I don't know.
The very next damn day, after we was working...
And, he said, that day:
"That'll be the last thing I ever do, is to shoot myself. "
Which it was.
There weren't none of his brains working. Period.
I tell you, he had two shells laying under the slLI of the house.
He crawled under there and got them.
Come out and told his wife, says,
"I've got one for you, and one for me.
"We're going. "
She run him down and took one of them away from him.
He sat down in an old, homemade, straight chair... and he pulled his shoe off... and he set that gun barreI right there... and pulled the trigger.
Pulled his shoe off to use his big toe to-
Yeah, but, hell, if I was gonna do that
I'd reach down there with my finger!
What? It'd have moved his head from the gun barreI.
- No, it wouldn't have.
- He had to stoop over there...
He pulled his shoe off in order to use his big toe to-
Everybody don't do things alike, but that's the way he done it.
Knowing that the Lord had called me to preach...
I had to pursue what the Lord had placed me on this world to do.
So I started back into the ministry.
In this line of work, you don't have the finances you'd like to have.
You see things that you'd like to have... you sometimes wish you're back in a secular position making better money.
But then I have a better situation than most people realize.
When I have a need, I just pray for it.
Justlike the van that I have now.
I felt I had a need for it.
So I began to pray, and then I began to go price vans.
But I didn't feel like my prayers and the prices I found on the vans... just coincided the way they ought to
'cause they were far out of my reach.
But stlLI, I feltlike if the Lord wanted me to have a van, I'd get one.
So in the process, a couple of weeks after I'd given up the idea... of finding one that I could afford...
I ran into a man, and he had a van.
I was looking at it.
He gave me the price on it.
I told him, "That's out of my range. "
He said,
"I've got a friend over in Marianna...
"that has a brand-new '79 van.
"It's been on his lot for eight months...
"and he's priced it down to $5,000 where it can be bought. "
He said, "I know it can be bought for $5,000."
That's kind of the range I was looking for.
And sure enough, I called the man.
He brought it to me... and in the process of three hours,
I owned the van.
God made all things... that was made.
All things that was made.
And he looked on it, and pronounced it... good and very good!
He made all these things that we've got today.
And he said it was good and very good.
But you could go to the extreme on anything.
Make a hog of yourself.
But as long as you let it golike God intended it, you need never worry.
He'll give you power and strength and wit to take care of the deaI.
There was a huge oak right on the bank of the creek.
I went and stood under the oak and I said:
"Lord, I don't know if you want me to have this lot or not.
"But if you do, well, then you make it possible for me to have it. "
So I went along for over a year.
And I didn't know if the lot had sold or anything.
But a year later, I had as much money as the man was asking for the lot.
I went to him to find out if he stlLI had it. Sure enough, he did.
He said, "You know, it's really ironic.
I've had this thing sold three times.
"And every time that I've had it sold, something's come up...
"and the party that was going to buy it didn't go through with the deaI."
He says, "I hope yours goes through. "
I says, "It's gonna go through because
I know this is an answer to prayer. "
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus
Sing his mercy and his grace
In the mansions bright and blessed
He'll prepare for us a place
When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory!
I was reading Romans not too awfully long ago.
And over and over, this word "therefore"... which is the first word in our Scripture this morning, began to pop out at me.
And I begin to think about it.
Because I remembered somewhere back yonder when I was in school... that an English teacher taught me about the meaning of words.
And this word "therefore" had a specific meaning.
And I think, well, if Paul is using this word so many times... there must be a reason for it.
So immediately,
I went to Webster's Dictionary... and I began to look up what the word
"therefore" was all about.
And I found the word to be a conjunction.
Now, I had long forgotten what a conjunction was.
And so, as soon as I realized it was a conjunction...
I thumbed back through the dictionary to the word "conjunction"... to see what a conjunction was, and Webster's Dictionary said... that a conjunction is an indeclinable word... that connects two thoughts together.
And so I said, "What does this word
'indeclinable' mean?"
And so I looked up the word "indeclinable"... and found that it meant that it was unchangeable.
And so I found out that "therefore" was a conjunction... that could not be changed that connected two thoughts together.
And so, therefore, whenever I found this out...
I looked at that word again in the first verse of our Scripture, and I said:
"Paul must have said something that this word is connecting together. "
So let's see what it was.
And when I began to look back,
I found out... that Paul had used that word "therefore"... many times in Romans before this, and many times in Romans after this.
And so I really got interested, so I looked in my concordance... and I found out that Paul used the word "therefore"... over 119 times in his writing.
And so, I think, well, if he used the word "therefore" over 119 times...
I need to find out what the Greek says about it.
So I looked up what the Greek meaning was... and the Greek word was "on, " which had a triple meaning.
The first one was "accordingly"... the next one was "likewise then, " and "then therefore. "
Paul says,
"Therefore you receive the peace. "
So if you're here this morning, you're Christian... and you don't have that peace,
I'll tell you what's happened.
You have taken back over the controls of your life... and you're holding on to that... which you ought to leave in God's hands.
As a result, you've lost the peace of your salvation.
And you won't gain it back... until you have another "therefore" experience.
I thank God this morning for the
"therefores" of Paul, here in Romans.
Perhaps there's someone here this morning who's never received Christ... they've never let him come into their hearts by faith.
They've never said, "Lord, I want you to have your way in my heart. "
You know what God's way in your heart is?
God wants to come in and cleanse you from your unrighteousness... and make something beautiful out of your life.
He wants to forgive you of your sins.
And God says, "You, come on!
Just believe, and I'll forgive you. "
The most important thing about turkey hunting is knowing your woods.
You can snatch me, or snake up... and carry us off to a place that we're not famlLiar with... we don't know the woods, the country...
Hey, man, you're lost.
You'relike taking me out of Vernon and sending me to New York City.
You just can't do nothing with them.
Knowing the woods.
Knowing which way they traveI.
So, in fact, just knowing the woods is one of the...
Just knowing the range.
And when you go to a new part of the country... man, you're lost, or I am.
Any turkey hunter's lost.
I don't really know of any crimes that's going on here.
Justlike any town, anywhere you go... you're gonna have little incidents... of things popping up.
Like someonewill walk in one of the stores and might pick up an apple... or clothespins or bobby pins or razorblades or somethinglike this.
But this goes on in all towns.
Nothing really more serious than that.
Not at this time that I know of.
I traveled along the road, you know, with a fellow in a car... and I was looking, and I say, "Barney.
You see that water over there?"
And he says, "Yeah. "
Then we come right up to it, and there was no water there.
It was just a mirage. In other words...
Well, to be... scientific about it... the lights, or the rays, the light bends.
So, if you get a different reflection, say, for instance... maybe a diamond don't even shine.
Maybe it's just the way it's cut, and the way the light hits it.
It's justlike some day after the rain.
You take a picture of those drops on the trees, and you can see them.
It's almost more beautifuI than the diamond.
I was out here in these woods one night.
And I just had the feeling that someone was out there.
And I heard that someone had fired a couple of shots out there.
It kind of had me worried that someone was out there.
I didn't know whether my walkie-talkie was working right or not.
But one time I was worried, or scared, whatever you might want to call it.
But this'll happen to the best of them.
Sometimes you just have that feeling... that there's someone up-close to you, or trying to get to you... when you're outlike that by yourself.
I had the camera. And I was lucky.
I held the opera glasses against the lens of the camera, and snapped it.
Of course,
I just about judged where the...
I couldn't line it up any other way... because when you had the opera glass on the lens... you couldn't see nothing.
And I held it up and it turned out.
Now, I don't know if this is the moon or not. It lookslike some clouds.
I don't know if this is a star or what.
Well, no, it couldn't be that because...
That's a picture of the star.
I just took the camera and pointed it up there. I didn't even sight it.
And then I took the picture that way.
Of course, as you can see, that picture ain't too good.
It's a cheap camera, you get a cheap picture.
Luck, you know.
I mean, when something turns out, you say, "Gee, I'm lucky. " Right?
Well, of course... you see, when you have a camera and you point it at a certain...
Justlike if you had a gun, you don't shoot, do you?
If you had a gun and you pointed it at something... you're liable to hit what you're pointing at. Then again, you might not.
The bullet came in... at just about this angle and went into my seat here.
You see, I haven't had that repaired.
It's a small hole there.
It went in there and lodged in the back of the seat.
The county sheriff's office came out to investigate.
They had to dig it out of the back seat, out of the back part of the seat.
It came in at an angle from the road.
I stlLI don't know why they did it.
Probably just to frighten me a little bit.
I'm not one that's gonna frighten easy about things.
It don't bug you too much... but the closer you get on him, you want to make the Kill so bad.
It's in your blood, or you wouldn't be out here hunting.
And believe me, it's in mine, and Snake's, too.
And the closer he gets... it's justlike you're going to be electrocuted.
Each day, it comes closer... the tension bulLds up.
It bulLds up in me.
I don't realize it.
But it's always bulLding up.
And the closer it gets, the worse it gets.
And after a whlLe, it comes to a point that you forget about it.
When he gets right there on you,
I mean, you go blank.
You're concentrating on making the Kill.
And once you make the Kill... you shoot, run, get the turkey, or run him down or miss him.
Then all that tension... that's bulLt up in you... it makes me sick.
You get the dry heaves,like you get on a morning after a Saturday night.
The dry heaves from a drunk.
Gag and puke. Just gag.
It's nothing but your nerves bulLt up that's dying down.
That's all it is.
In four, five minutes, I'm all right.
Every star you see up there, maybe it is a world.
You know, I mean, it was made for some purpose.
You know, it's just up there, see, and maybe... in the future there'll be one Irish world... one German world, one Russian world... and one colored world.
I mean, each party has their own world.
But who knows?
You don't know God's plan.
Even Jesus Christ didn't know.
It says right in the Bible... that no man can find out the answer to that... when the end of the world is.
Well, not the end of the world, but the end of our world.
Our scheme of things.
Politicians, you know.
In a little town when you talk to somebody... and you tell them about the lights on the road, they're not blinking.
They don't want to take no responsiblLity.
I says, "Who do you call? DOT?"
They didn't know, see. They don't care.
They should run them out of town, on a ralL, tar and feathers.
Yeah, Ilike that.
That tar and feathers.
Boy, wouldn't youlike that?
To see some guy, or some kid that did something wrong... and they'd tar and feather him?
Well, he'd have something to think about, wouldn't he?
Next time we'll give you the hot seat, buddy.
I've never seen anything more perfect in my life... than to see the perfection of God himself.
You hear so much.
That thing just happened.
That just happened.
Folks think that way all the time.
"That just happened. "
There was an old fellow talking to me in that house up yonder.
He said,
"There ain't no such thing as a God. "
I said, "Mr. Day?"
I said, "You believe you're here, don't you?"
"Yeah, I believe I'm here. "
I said, "Do you believe any man on earth made you?"
"No, I didn't make me. "
I said, "Do you believe any man on earth made Adam and Eve?"
He said, "No, I don't believe it. "
I said, "What made them?
How come I'm here?"
He said, "That just happened. "
I said, "You saying 'just happened,' let's call that God. "
Let's give it another name.
And say, "That just happened. "
That's what God is: just happened.
Whenever I got through work... had a vacation coming in... the boss man give me a bonus.
I come in home, and we left that evening and started out.
We drove all night and all day.
We didn't stop-
1,413 mlLes out there.
White Sands Missile Base, out there.
That's where the first atomic bomb was ever dropped.
There are sand dunes in there.
And that sand, it crawls.
It crawls over the roads.
They're sweeping it all the time to keep it from covering up the roads.
It's growing sand.
That sand grows.
That desert runs out an average of 14 feet a year.
They've got graders.
They keep grading it off the road.
There's graders out there all the time grading that sand off the road.
Pushing that sand back off of those roads, where you get in there.
Build new roads every day.
Wind come in over that dry sand.
It wraps up so deep by sand overnight.
I reckon, it runs as high as a telephone pole.
Paid and went in there... and got where the white sand's at.
We got us some white sand.
I got a jar here where it grows in it.
See now, I had just a little bit of this in this jar whenever I brought it out.
And now, you see, my jar is nearly full.
It grows. It crawls.
It crawls up the side of the jar, you see?
I reckon it's gonna fill up this jar.
In two more years, itwill fill up this jar.
They say it grows 14 feet a year... out where the town that Billy the Kid got Killed.
They say itwill cover that town in a year to come.
This century, less than 100 years...
- that desertwill eat it up.
- Itwill cover that town.
WILI you look at that tree?
There's 1, 2, 3, 4...
Thirty-fifth one flew.
Thirty-five on one cypress stump.
Listen to that sound.
Hear that sound?
Getting in and out of trees?
That flop-flop sound?
That soundwill sure mistake you for turkeys.
Listen.
Hear that flop-flop. Limbs breaking.
Hear that good flop, then?
Listening to that gives me the turkey fever.
I wish there were as many turkeys as there are buzzards.

Summer means many different things to different people.
To some, it might mean the thrill of a high-speed catamaran.
Others like to float around and soak up a few stray rays.
Still others like some kind of inland activity.
But for us, it's the sport of surfing!
The thrill and the fun of the sport of surfing.
Some people like to bodysurf.
Others like to ride a short belly board and get a short ride.
Still others like a short bellyboard and a long ride, like George Greenough at Santa Barbara, California.
Most surfers like to ride a regular board... and perform on medium-sized waves.
Most would like to perform as well as Australian
Nat Young here.
Or as well as American surfer
Butch Van Artsdalen.
Some surfers prefer the hairy thrill of a big wave.
You can go right or left, but you can't very well do both at once.
If you do, at least it's something commonly known in the surfing world... as a wipeout.
The only way to avoid a wipeout is to take this wide
"stink bug" stance.
Spread your legs and hang on till your trunks rip right up the back.
No place represents summertime to more people than the Hawaiian Islands.
To surfers, summer in Hawaii means the reefs near waikiki that break so well-- places like this spot, about a third of a mile out over the reef.
It's called Number Three.
Right next to Number Two.
One of the outstanding surfers from Hawaii-- Mr. Paul Strou.
There are many places on the reef that break during the summer.
About 300 yards from Number Three is another spot called Kaisers.
Friendly surfers in Hawaii.
"Hi there, Charlie."
Conditions are ideal. water temperature averaging 75 degrees.
The air temperature--
75 degrees.
One of the most popular summer breaks is just off to one side... of the Ala wai
Yacht Harbor entrance, a spot called Ala Moana.
On a weekend, you see surfboards, boats, every imaginable thing using the harbor entrance.
In fact, the new sport over there is "trolling for surfers."
If you can sort yourself out from the boats, you can get a great ride, like Gene Harris is doing here at Ala Moana.
Another outstanding surfer from Hawaii-- Fred Hemmings.
Fred only stands up on alternate Wednesdays, but when he does, he really wails.
Just across the entrance channel from Ala Moana is another surfing spot, called Garbage Hole.
They built a breakwater that cut the surf off, but in its day... this spot produced some fantastic rides for surfers like Wayne Miyata.
The ultimate thing to do in surfing is to be actually covered up by the wave.
And here goes Wayne doing the ultimate thing.
This is summertime in Hawaii.
California has a lot of places that represent summer to a lot of people, no place more than this "secret spot"--
Malibu Beach, California, famous for its Malibu
Outriggers, surfing and girls.
This a girl, and for those of you who are maladjusted, this is a Malibu Outrigger.
A lot of good surfers ride in Malibu.
One of the best is Lance Carson.
Say hello to the folks, Lance.
At-a-baby. when Lance goes out at Malibu, he really gives the place a going-over.
He stays in just the perfect spot on the wave, which is right in front of the white water... in the breaking part of the wave called the curl.
The main object in surfing is to always remain in the curl.
Stay as close as possible to the white water without actually getting caught by it.
All the maneuvers in surfing-- turning, stalling, trimming, riding the nose-- are directed toward the ultimate aim of staying in the curl.
Lance's real speciality is noseriding.
A lot of surfers run up to the nose.
A lot run up and right off the end.
Lance usually stays around for a while.
He's so relaxed up there, you get the feeling... he could have a ham sandwich while he's waiting around.
A surfer who can ride Malibu better than anyone in the world is Miki Dora.
As Phil Edwards says of Miki,
"His style is so advanced, most surfers don't even understand what he's trying to do."
He's very good at winding his way through the crowds at Malibu... without losing any of his composure.
On a small wave inside,
Miki with one of his unique maneuvers, side-slipping his board back and forth in the wave.
He's the only surfer
I've ever seen do this.
Mr. Miki Dora.
A young fella named Corky Carroll gets great rides... wherever he happens to be surfing.
Corky also comes up with some pretty strange things.
Here's a pretty strange pullout.
An "El Rollo." when Corky does something strange, everyone for 50 yards knows all about it.
"Hey, did you guys see that El Rollo?
Boy, it was a beauty!"
Yeah, big deal, Corky.
During the wintertime in California, the conditions really change.
The water temperature drops down to 48 degrees sometimes... at places like Steamer Lane in Santa Cruz.
Steamer Lane, home of the world's latest takeoff.
The only person comfortable surfing in this cold water is Henry.
Henry is a seal, nature's greatest bodysurfer.
Other places in California get big during the wintertime, like the Redondo Beach
Breakwater.
Although California isn't known for its big surf, you can see... occasionally it gets big, and biggest during the wintertime.
Many surfers ride summer and winter, but the ultimate thing for most of us would be to have an endless summer.
The warm water and waves, without the summer crowds of California.
The only way to do this is by traveling around the world, following the summer season as it moves around the world.
Two surfers,
Robert August and Mike Hynson, have been planning a trip like this for some time.
The winter evening before their departure, in front of a warm fire, reading up on a few last-minute books on Africa, which would be their first stop.
Robert August. Mike Hynson.
Packing for the journey was important.
Six pairs of trunks, two boxes of wax, some modern sounds and, in case of injury, one band-aid.
It was a cold, foggy winter morning in November... when Mike and Robert were ready to depart... on the first leg of their endless summer journey around the world.
On the plane heading for Africa,
Robert wondered what was in store for them. would the find surf? would they catch malaria? would they be speared by a native?
He didn't have any idea.
Across the U.S., then across the Atlantic Ocean, landing in Africa for the first time... at Dakar, Senegal.
They didn't know what to expect in Dakar, and at dawn at the airport, they were anxious to get under way... and find an inexpensive place to stay.
They were a bit perturbed when a government official informed them... they didn't have any choice-- they had to stay... at a certain government-owned hotel or leave the country.
So they had their introduction to primitive Africa... at one of the primitive little hotels along the seashore.
The rates here were unbelievable-- $30 a day each.
As you walk through the front door, they stamp
"sucker" on your forehead.
The joke turned out to be on the government, however, because right out in front of this hotel was a little island... about a quarter of a mile offshore.
And off each end of this island was surf breaking, surf that no one had ever ridden before... and, as far as we know, no surfer had ever even seen before.
It's pretty scary paddling out for the first time... at a strange spot like this.
They had no idea what they might find in the water.
So they stuck pretty close together.
For moral support, they took off together on the first wave, figuring if anything happened to them, it would happen equally... and probably wouldn't hurt so badly that way.
Takes a while to get used to any new surfing spot, but here in Africa, surfing for the first time, it takes a little longer.
Mike, on the left of the screen, pointing out a rock just underwater to Robert.
You find out where the rocks are, how the waves are breaking over the rocks or reef.
Find out if there's any funny little fish who might be mad-- things like that. what we call
"getting a place wired."
After you get it wired, it's just like... riding waves back in the U.S.A., except you aren't.
You're in Africa.
They couldn't get over being in Africa.
Mike would pull out of a wave, paddle over to Robert and say,
"Robert, guess what? we're in Africa!"
I don't know what it was, but it was really hard to accept.
They practiced the buddy system.
If one lost his board, the other would paddle over and pick up the board-- or body. whichever was closest.
You don't want to do a lot of swimming in the water down here.
Here they were, only four hours off an airplane from the United States, and already into better surf than they'd left behind them the day they left California.
They're still in the Northern Hemisphere, and although it's officially wintertime, the water temperature was 70 degrees.
They rode these waves knowing they were the first to ever do it, and also knowing the closest surfer to them was over
4,000 miles away.
This place broke a long way out, so most people didn't notice what was going on.
A few of the native kids spotted the activity and came to watch.
Being good Africans, they threw a few rocks.
Some of the sharp-eyed fishermen on the beach paddled out... to get a closer look in their full race canoes.
One of the fishermen was really stoked.
He was trying to shoot the shore break in his canoe.
Your surfing style in strange waters like this would normally be very conservative.
You could hardly call Mike's or Robert's style conservative.
Mike with a great ride--
Dakar, Senegal, west Africa-- completely covered up.
They figured at the rates they were being charged at the hotel, each wave was costing them about 9.95.
Mike hit the bottom and picked up a little ding on his head.
It was so expensive in Senegal, they decided to leave.
A cup of coffee costs the equivalent of one American dollar in Senegalese francs.
Their next stop would be Accra,
Ghana, about 2,000 miles down Africa's Gold Coast.
Landing in a strange country like this was pretty weird.
The people of course knew nothing about surfing and had never seen a surfboard.
They thought the boards were some kind of airplane wing.
Commonplace things for us like getting a ride with your surfboard were major projects.
They finally commandeered this taxicab and are trying to explain to the driver... that they want to tie the boards on the roof.
They even brought rope to do it with.
The driver didn't speak English and didn't understand.
Mike kept saying, "Look, they'll fall out of the trunk.
Let's put them on the roof."
The driver kept muttering something that must have meant,
"Airplane wings go in the trunk."
None of this was staged.
The discussion went on for half an hour, and the driver finally did it the way he thought was best.
Can you imagine driving down the highway in the U.S. like that?
They'd put you in prison.
They made it to a little hotel without the boards falling out, congratulating the driver for being such a good packer.
He really liked Mike and Robert.
Didn't even charge them for the ride, and offered to spend a couple of days with them... showing them around his country of Ghana.
No charge. All they had to do was buy gasoline for his cab. when they stopped to buy gasoline for his cab, it turned out to be not a very good deal.
Gasoline in Ghana is very expensive-- five-point-four-and-a-half shillings per gallon, almost one American dollar for a gallon of gas.
It was, as the name of it implied, really "Agip."
In a few minutes in West Africa, you can be out of a city into a very primitive area.
That's where they are now, at a primitive fishing village in Ghana.
Most of these people had never seen a white man before.
As they walked down the beach, they really wondered if they were doing the right thing.
They didn't know whether the U.N. had been there yet or not.
They were a little nervous on the beach, so they paddled right out in the water.
Paddling out, they had the horrible thought that maybe surfing... would violate some religious taboo of the natives, and they'd attack.
During the first ride, the hundreds of natives were dead silent, but went Robert pulled out, they really went wild.
[Shouting, Cheering]
That was the beginning of surfing in Ghana.
The people couldn't believe it.
They came down to the beach with their kids and their lunch... and they still had both hands free.
The natives had never seen or even dreamed of anything like this before.
They stood there for hours, completely fascinated.
If you lost your board, it would come inside, and the native kids would hop on it and play with it till you come and ask for it back.
Usually they'd give it back, but they were kids, and you were bigger than they were.
But you weren't bigger than the chief, who was bigger than anybody.
That's why he was chief.
If you lost your board and the chief wanted to play with it, there really wasn't much you could say about it. watch Robert trying to be tactful here.
"Hi there, chief.
Nice day, huh, sir? May I have my board back, please?"
One reason the natives were so excited about surfing... was because they themselves paddle out through the surf every day... in their big dug-out canoes to go fishing.
So they have a real feeling for the sea and waves, and could fully appreciate
Mike and Robert's ability on their surfboards.
This is really an interesting tribe of native fishermen.
Their method of fishing has remained unchanged for thousands of years.
Everything they have, they make themselves.
The ropes and nets are woven from some fiber they get in the jungle.
The canoe is hollowed out of a single, gigantic hardwood log. when they go stroking out to sea in their big dug-out canoe, and you're sitting outside, looking at them paddling toward you, you think they're coming out with their forks to have you for dinner.
♪♪ [Singing
In Native Language]
They couldn't speak English, and Mike couldn't speak their language.
They paddled by and said something like--
[Imitates Native Language]
Mike smiled and said,
"Yeah, man, hang 10."
They thought that was great.
They went stroking out, chanting, "Hang 10, hang 10!"
The only English word they know is "hang 10."
That has to be unique.
They lay the net in a big semicircle.
Normally they avoid riding waves in the canoes, but they thought they'd give
Mike and Robert a little thrill.
They did when they took off on a wave in their two-ton hardwood canoe.
♪♪ [Continues]
Surfing one of these things is like trying to surf the Santa Fe Super Chief.
They fish the same stretch of beach every day, and have been for hundreds of years.
If they move a mile up or down the beach, they run into another tribe of fishermen who have that area all staked out.
And if they infringe on each other's area, a big war starts and everybody gets massacred.
It's really a mess.
So they stay pretty much in their own area. with the last of the canoes coming in, everyone in the village... turns out to help pull in the big net.
♪♪ [Singing
In Native Language]
They all have duties.
Here's the head rope coiler.
♪♪ [Continues]
It takes them about an hour to get the net in, and they usually catch quite a few fish.
They have to divide the catch up among themselves.
They don't have any money, but they bargain for the fish anyway.
The session goes on for half an hour, with everyone hollering at each other at full volume.
Their approach is like,
"Look, Casafugo, I pulled harder, so I get more fish."
And the other guy says,
"Yeah, but I stayed up late last night worrying about it."
The other guy says,
"well, I'm bigger than you.
I'm taking the fish."
Part of it has to do with how big and strong you are and what you know.
This woman must have known karate.
The surfboards really attracted a lot of attention, as did Mike and Robert.
Robert with a big group surrounding him.
They were asking him questions in their native tongue, and he was answering what he thought might be the questions in English.
No one understood one word of what the other guy was saying.
But when you get surrounded by a group like that, you just don't just walk away.
The kids in the village really got excited about surfing.
They got so excited, they started ripping down their houses.

The start of bellyboard surfing in Ghana.
♪♪ [Fades]
The kids wanted to learn how to ride a real surfboard, so Mike and Robert organized a little surfing school.
First thing the kids had to learn was to rough up the wax on the deck of the board... with some sand so they wouldn't slip off.
Plenty of help.
The biggest problem in the school was selecting one student.
They all wanted to be the student, and you can only teach one at a time, so you just looked around and tried to find a kid with a pair of trunks.
Teach him first.
Robert starting his student off near shore, pushing him into a wave.
First time this little
African boy had ever been on a surfboard in his life.
Mike didn't fool around near shore.
He started his students outside in the heavies.
If they let go of the board, they'd lose their turn as students, so they'd hang on to the thing sideways in the soup.
They weren't afraid of anything.
The best one of the day was a beautiful tandem late takeoff, sideways.
As is usual in West Africa, when the little guys try something and survive, the big guys take the boards away and go out and try it themselves.
A couple of the heavies got the boards and started stroking out.
Keep in mind these men had never seen a surfboard, let alone ever tried to ride one.
It takes most beginners a long time to just catch a wave.
In my years of surfing,
I've never seen anything like this.
The very first wave he tried.
- His buddies were really stoked.
- [Cheering]
They started getting kinda cocky after a while-- one-armed paddles.
These fellas were amazing.
They didn't have much trouble catching waves.
They didn't even have too much trouble standing up for a short time.
They had absolutely no trouble at all... getting the board back from the people inside.
Mike and Robert would have to argue, but watch when the heavy comes in to get the board.
No argument.
They started getting it really wired.
Some pretty hot angles going, and a beautiful El Rollo.
They even came up with a few original maneuvers.
A west African pullout here called a "reverse Patrice Lumumba."
These men were so excited about surfing that we felt sure after we left... they'd shape their own surfboard from some jungle tree... and are probably out there surfing right now.
The only problem came when the local constable walked up, said,
"Sorry.
No surfing after 11:00."
He didn't look too friendly, so we didn't argue.
The kids didn't like that rule.
They gave him a little lip, like, "How'd you like a black eye, cop?"
Their time just about up in Ghana, they strolled down the beach and said good-bye to the newfound friends.
Our next stop--
Lagos, Nigeria, just a short hop down the coast.
On these short flights, we took some pretty weird airlines.
This one was South Mombasa, with a U.N.-trained
African pilot... flying a war surplus DC-1.
Figured he'd give 'em a little thrill.
[Engines Roaring]
Once into Nigeria,
Mike and Robert hitched a ride... and struck off to look for surf in a place no one had ever surfed before.
The odds against finding surf in a strange country are pretty high.
Even getting to a beach is difficult. with their fantastic luck still with them, they hiked into a beach and paddled right out into some hot little waves. when I say "hot" in this case,
I don't refer to the shape of the waves, but to the actual temperature of the waves.
The water temperature here in Nigeria, almost on the equator, was an unbelievable 91 degrees.
It melted the wax right off the board.
The air temperature was about 100.
The humidity felt like 5,000%.
It felt drier underwater than it did up there in the air.
United Nations ship outside, ready to enter the harbor at Lagos, Nigeria. we have no way of knowing whether this is a good day of surf for Nigeria, or a bad one.
All we know-- it was like this when we were there, and it's still better than a lot of days we get in California.
Unlike Ghana, only one native watched.
He wasn't exactly overactive.
Neither would you be when it's 100 degrees.
It was so hot on the beach,
I decided to wade out in the water... and show you what it looks like if you're standing chest-deep in Nigerian water... watching Mike Hynson ride by, perched on the nose.
You keep one eye on Mike, and the other eye on the bottom... for creatures like stonefish that exist there.
If you step on a stonefish, you die in about 15 minutes.
Surfing a place like this is no problem.
The problem is finding it to begin with, and in this case, the problem was getting back to the road to hitch a ride.
They had to hike through a jungle between the beach and a road.
If you get off the path, you never find your way out.
This was a full-on jungle, full of all kinds of creepy things-- snakes, spiders.
They expected Tarzan to come swinging by on a vine.
[Airplane Engines whirring]
From Nigeria, they're headed to South Africa.
They'll be crossing the equator for the first time.
For the first time, it's now officially summer.
It was November.
Landing in Cape Town, they'll also be going to Durban,
1,200 miles up the coast.
The landmark at Cape Town that's as famous as Diamond Head... is Table Mountain.
Let's go up on top and take a look.
From the top, you can see a long way down the Cape Peninsula.
It's a finger of land about 20 miles long and five miles wide.
It separates two great oceans.
On one side of the peninsula is the Atlantic Ocean.
On the other, the Indian Ocean, ending in the famous
Cape of Good Hope.
It's a 2,000-foot vertical drop from Table Mountain... to the suburbs of Cape Town below.
Mike getting his jollies in for the day.
There are surfers in South Africa.
John Whitmore is the leader of the group in Cape Town.
John makes surfboards and sells Volkswagens.
There are about a hundred surfers around Cape Town, and when Mike and Robert arrived, all 100 of them took the day off to go surfing.
California surfers usually split up into small groups... and go to different beaches, trying to avoid crowds.
Here in Cape Town, they like to go all together.
Down the Cape Highway, past many beaches with no one on them and good surf.
But they don't split up.
They all go to the same beach.
It doesn't matter what beach, as long as they're together.
They were also anxious to see
Mike and Robert surf.
They get to the beach together, but when they actually surf, they split up into small groups.
One or two, 10 or 20--
They don't care.
The more, the merrier.
These are brave men.
As you can tell, they haven't been surfing long in Cape Town, but they really have a ball.
They get out there and really go at it-- bite, scratch, kick and really shove each other around.
John Whitmore, who made most of their surfboards.
He's also been surfing longer than most of the other people down there.
The South Africans were so enthusiastic about Mike and Robert's surfing ability, there were instances when surfers drove 400 miles just to meet them.
They'd drive 400 miles, get out of the car, shake hands and drive 400 miles back home again.
There are very few teenagers that surf around Cape Town.
Here's one of the few,
Peter Basford, getting a nice ride.
The average age around
Cape Town for surfers would be in their late 20s and 30s.
Mike and Robert were quick to make friends with the natives... wherever they visited.
Robert with a good pair of dark glasses on so they couldn't see where he was looking.
They spent a few happy days around Cape Town meeting natives, but they'd come here to get away from the crowds... and find a beach they could surf by themselves.
So they borrowed a car and struck off alone down the Cape Peninsula... to look for some surf.
If you want to be alone, you're welcome to be alone in South Africa.
It's one of the few places in the world you can even be alone on the main highway.
You pass many beaches with not a soul on them, not a footprint in the sand, and there hasn't been one in 10 years.
You can be so alone on the beach down there, it's almost scary.
They called this place
Long Beach... and paddled out for a few waves.
Conditions here resemble Northern California, with heavy kelp beds outside.
The kelp cuts the chop and makes the waves inside smoother, although it makes them smaller.
This is on the Atlantic side of the Cape Peninsula, and although it's summertime, the water temperature is only 54 degrees.
It never gets very warm on the Atlantic side of the peninsula, but only five miles away across land is the Indian Ocean.
The water there is sometimes
20 degrees warmer on the same day.
The best surf seems to be on the Atlantic side, so most of the surfing around
Cape Town is done in cold water, even in the summer. with the tremendous difference in water temperature between the two oceans... separated by such a narrow land mass, it causes some pretty good winds to blow.
Here's a little afternoon offshore breeze around Cape Town.
[wind whistling]
Nobody gets very excited about it.
They just tie their car to a tree and watch their kids as they go sailing by.
Mike and Robert decided to head for Durban, which is 1,200 miles up the Indian Ocean coast.
So off they went to Durban.
If you try to hitch a ride at Durban, you can sit there... for three days and never see a car.
As the hours rolled by and the warm summer sun beat down,
Mike couldn't help but think back to the summer that had passed in California, and the places that break during California's summertime, like The wedge in Newport Beach.
The dirty old wedge.
The dirty old wedge, where $6,000 worth of swim fins were lost last year-- and their owners.
The wedge in California, where you catch waves you didn't even want.
You come out of the water after a wave like this, your back looks like a Twist-O-Flex watchband.
Few people ride bellyboards at The wedge.
Bodysurfing is bad enough, because when you get wiped out, it feels like your arms, legs and head are all going different directions.
Add a bellyboard to that mess, it's like an extra piece of shrapnel in a hand grenade.
The waves break in very shallow water, so if you don't land just right, you can really get bent.
They come out with shovels at low tide and dig you out of the sand.
Usually on a big day, it's a very short ride.
It's kind of a big drop.
Occasionally someone gets a long ride.
Here's some kind of record for a big day.
I can't figure out whether this guy has a bellyboard... or is bodysurfing... or has rigor mortis of the stomach.
You may wonder why people don't occasionally land on each other.
As a matter of fact, occasionally they do.
In fact, they do it all the time.
Here's once.
This is the slam-bang, crowded action of California's summertime.
Mike Hynson and Robert August were glad they were here, especially when they looked down the highway... and saw the first car coming their way... in the shimmering heat waves of summer in South Africa.
There was a truck with a surfboard on top.
A surfboard's a rare thing to see in South Africa.
It turned out to be a young surfer named James... and an older fellow named Terence... who was taking James a few miles up the coast to go surfing.
They met, and Mike and Robert explained they were headed for Durban, 1,200 miles away.
Terence was only going a few miles, but he thought it over for a minute and said,
"what the heck?
Load your boards.
I'll take you to Durban."
On the spur of the moment,
Terence decided, and ended up driving Mike and Robert over 2,000 miles through South Africa, a trip that took him out of his way for two weeks.
Terence Bullen.
He doesn't surf.
He captures animals for zoos around the world... and milks cobra snakes for their venom.
He handles a thousand deadly cobras a week, and when he's not extracting their venom, he keeps them in baskets in his bedroom.
He's one of the few people in the world to capture an African elephant alive.
Terence wasn't afraid of anything in the world, except the ocean, and he wouldn't go in that for anything.
This is the truck he uses for hunting safaris.
This is the truck that took us
1,200 miles along the virgin coastline of the Indian Ocean.
If you thoroughly explored the surfing possibilities along the beaches, it would take you 10 years. we just concentrated on places right alongside the paved highway.
You pull off in the morning, look out. There'll be a place like this.
It doesn't even have a name.
So you go out for a wave before breakfast.
About 300 miles north of
Cape Town on the Indian Ocean, the water was 70 degrees.
Offshore breezes.
Perfect conditions.
There are hundreds of places like this up and down that 1,200-mile coastline... between Cape Town and Durban.
Mike out, along with James, who is just learning how to surf.
Robert stayed on the beach to keep his eye on Terence... because Terence had a habit of pulling tricks on them.
Like one time he caught a couple of cobras... and wrapped them up in their sleeping bags. when they unrolled the bags, he really laughed.
He thought that was hysterical.
This particular day, Terence got a couple of horses... and launched Mike and Robert down the beach.
They'd never ridden one in their lives. He laughed so hard, he almost got a hernia.
Robert with a death grip on an English saddle.
Threatened to drown Terence if he could catch him.
With this man, we drove thousands of miles through South Africa.
Mike's radio always at full volume.
Scared the daylights out of any animal around.
These animals are really an impressive thing to see.
You drive through countryside that looks like parts of the United States.
You almost forget you're in Africa.
But suddenly you remember when a big eland goes trudging off from beside the road.
It weighs almost a ton.
As the countryside changes, you see different animals.
A little further along, we saw a herd of impala having lunch... right beside the road.
Mike and Robert like to surf more than anything else, but they each felt they'd like to spend at least six months in South Africa... doing nothing but looking at animals.
It's really an impressive thing to see.
There are hundreds of different kinds, and Terence knew them all. with his sharp eyes, he could spot them about 10 miles away.
This is a bontebok, now rare.
Mike started his career as a game stalker in his camouflage shirt.
Terence would always send them out after things.
He'd say, "See how close you guys can get to those giraffes."
Then he'd lock the doors, roll up the windows, sit in there giggling like a maniac, tell you about the lion in the bushes later.
There are millions of monkeys in South Africa.
If you park your car out in the country and forget to lock it, the monkeys climb out of the trees, get in the car and take anything... that's not bolted down-- windshield wipers, radio knobs, everything in the glove compartment-- and pass it up to their buddies in the tree.
They've got a regular auto supply store going up there.
You come back and start yelling for your parts, they just giggle and throw you down a '38 Hudson hubcap.
There are many native villages.
This is a Zulu village. we were a little afraid to go in it, so Mike picked out the littlest guy to meet first.
He was more afraid than we were.
Arrow shirt going there.
Shot by an arrow.
He couldn't speak English, and we couldn't speak Zulu, so we just shook hands and tried to be friendly.
Robert called him "Mr. Clean."
Continuing the journey up the coast.
The further north you go in South Africa, the hotter it gets.
They drove all night, arriving in Durban first thing in the morning, and were greeted by some of the local surfers who live in the area--
Jack Wilson, Max Wetteland and Harry Bold.
Morning comes pretty early in Durban.
The sun is already up, and it's only 4:30 a.m.
Robert out for a few waves in the shimmering heat... of tropical South Africa--
Durban.
4:30 in the morning-- it's already 80 degrees out. water temperature about the same.
With the warm water, there's a tremendous problem with sharks.
Later in the afternoon, around 5:30 a.m., some more of the local surfers showed up.
They haven't been surfing long around Durban either, but they get some great rides.
They call their bathing suits down there "costumes."
In America, we call this thing a G-string.
As I mentioned, sharks are a tremendous problem here.
If you go in the water away from the main beach, the odds are 50-50 you'll be killed by a shark.
This beach is meshed, or netted against sharks.
But even here you keep your eyes open.
You look over the top of a wave and see a fin coming toward you, your heart stops.
If you're swimming, you really wish you weren't.
Turned out to be only a group of friendly porpoises... who were coming in to see what was going on in their ocean.
Shows you how well the nets work.
Everyone's happy to see the porpoises, because when they're around, they seem to keep the sharks away.
Sharks and porpoises have yet to integrate in South Africa.
After surfing, you can ride the Zulu rickshaw down the promenade.
It's a lot of fun.
All the tourists do it.
This driver wasn't very heavy, and he wasn't used to all the weight in the rickshaw.
He was bouncing along Zulu-style, bounced once too high... and got stuck up there.
Leaving Durban, heading to Johannesburg where we catch a plane for Australia.
Driving through the interior past these rugged thorn bushes... that reminded us so much of tough old Terence... and the dirty tricks he pulled, like telling Mike to go pet the zebra. what we remember most about South Africa... is a place we discovered with our friend Terence.
On the map, we could see a big cape sticking out seven miles to sea, a point of land called on the map Cape St. Francis.
It was about three miles across these sand dunes to the water. we had no idea what was on the other side, but we'd come halfway around the world, so we thought we'd go take a look. we struck off across the sand dunes led by our friend...
"Terence of Africa."
Halfway around the world and halfway across the dunes, it seemed like a bad idea.
It started to get pretty hot.
The odds were against us finding surf. we didn't even know if we'd find the water. when you go looking for surf, you don't look for a really big wave.
If you found one, you'd never ride it in strange waters.
It would be much too dangerous. what every surfer dreams of finding is a small wave with perfect shape. what we call a perfect wave.
The odds against finding that are
10 million-to-one.
They finally got their first look at
Cape St. Francis, South Africa.
You can't tell how good a wave is till you actually ride it.
On Mike's first ride, the first five seconds, he knew he'd finally found that perfect wave.
The waves looked like they'd been made by some kind of a machine.
The rides were so long,
I couldn't get most of them on one piece of film.
Here's Mike further along, still riding the same wave at Cape St. Francis.
On some of the rides,
I timed them in the curl for 45 seconds.
Outside, really driving about halfway through the wave already, Robert August.
Look at the wave in front.
Same perfect shape as the wave he's on.
After we rode Cape St. Francis, we talked to fishermen... who come in this area quite frequently.
They told us the waves there were funny looking things.
They said they looked like pipes.
And they said the waves always looked like that.
Day after day, same stupid looking waves.
They told us of days when the surf broke big out by the end of the cape, seven miles further out, and rolled all the way in to where we were surfing.
Can you imagine riding a 15-foot wave shaped like this for seven miles?
You'd have a nervous breakdown the first 50 yards.
I had one on a three-foot wave.
From all the information we could gather, we figure it's like this about 300 days of the year.
The water was 70 degrees, the prevailing wind there, straight offshore.
A perfect wave, and perfect conditions.
The only disadvantage was you kept getting cramps in your legs... from squatting down for so long in the curl.
The thing you can't show is the fantastic speed... and that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach.
It's the kind of a wave that makes you talk to yourself.
I couldn't help but think of the hundreds of years... these waves must have been breaking here.
But until this day, no one had ever ridden one.
Think of the thousands of waves that went to waste, and the waves that are going to waste right now at Cape St. Francis.
Out of the whole day of surfing, we didn't see one wave section, or break in front of itself.
Each wave was perfect.
The surf came in diagonally, which gave you this long ride-- was shallow, only a foot or two deep beneath Robert's board.
Sandy bottom with rocks along the shoreline.
Strictly a one-man wave.
Just wasn't room for two surfers.
Here, Robert's really in the right spot.
But Mike, with the wake of his board... causing the wave to break sooner than it normally would have.
Before long,
Mike was in the right spot.
Every surfer dreams of finding a place as good as Malibu or Rincon. we found a place that's better, and it's better every day.
The best ride of the day was one that Robert got-- really locked in, screaming at the top of his lungs.
Robert came over the top of the wave... and let out a bellow you could hear halfway back to Cape Town.
He was so excited, he was almost frothing at the mouth.
Mike was kind of excited too.
Oh, big deal. we've seen a lot of surfing so far in the endless summer.
Let's see what it looks like now when you're actually in the water riding... as we watch the amazing footwork of Mr. Phil Edwards in Hawaii.
I'd like to show you what a wipeout looks like from the board.
I'm pretty good at getting wiped out, so I'll be the stooge.
If you watch carefully, you can see the board pearl, the coral bottom and my head come by with bubbles coming out the ears.
You come up looking for your board and find... you have one extra hole in the head from the back of the camera. while Mike and Robert are making their way to Australia, let's see what's going on in Hawaii.
Lots of girls surf in Hawaii, and many of them are very good.
Taking off outside in the green...
"chest protector,"
Bernie Ross.
This is Haleiwa Beach on the North Shore of the island of Oahu in Hawaii.
Butch Van Artsdalen with a spinner.
There's a shallow spot in the reef at Haleiwa... right about there.
Butch Van Artsdalen, really a fantastic surfer.
Switches his stance back and forth, riding with either foot forward.
A few surfers do this, but none as well as Butch.
He does it in impossible situations, like right in the middle of a pullout in midair.
Right here.
Butch Van Artsdalen.
A surfer who's not as skilled as Butch... but who has as much fun as anyone's ever had surfing... is Lord James Blears, the famous wrestler.
Here goes the Lord with one of his famous
"Tallyho" pullouts.
Tallyho!
If he gets mad at the wave, he just crushes the poor thing.
The wave gets mad at you, it just crushes you right back again.
On a crowded day at Haleiwa, you see boards and bodies going in every imaginable direction.
Although by the calendar it's wintertime in Hawaii, the water is 75 degrees, and so is the air.
The temperature only changes about two degrees during the year.
So unless you have sensitive skin, you can't tell whether it's winter or summer in Hawaii.
Hawaii is truly a land of an endless summer.
Fella you saw at Malibu now riding Haleiwa,
Miki Dora.
Miki rides well frontwards... or backwards.
A Hawaiian surfer who's really fantastic is Conrad Cunha. when he plants his 200 pounds right over his feet, you get the feeling nothing could knock him off that board.
Just like he's glued down.
In fact his friends call him
"willie will Hold."
Out in front of Conrad,
Australian Mick McManus, really getting covered up.
There was a young fellow out surfing that day... who had a little trouble with a growth on his back.
Actually, his father fixed him up with a life preserver... so if he fell off he'd float... face down.
Dear old Dad. with a warm wind in Hawaii blowing, you'll often see the speedy
Pacific catamarans... out in the Ala wai Yacht Harbor having a ball.
Surfers when they're not surfing having almost as much fun.
The gusts of wind blowing out of Manoa Valley.
And when the crews hiking out to windward trying to hold the hull down.
Hiking out, hanging onto a thin line.
Thin, slippery line.
Once you lose your crew, you're liable to lose the whole boat.
These cats are a lot of fun in the harbor, but they're a real thrill on the open ocean riding ground swells.
Let's hop on board one now with Bob Casey... and Phil Edwards in the blue water off Diamond Head... and see what it looks like from on board charging at a ground swell at 20 miles an hour. water comes off the bow like it was shot from a fire hose.
Phil decided to cool off, troll for sharks. wiggle your toes three times and strike! whether you like to surf or sail, or surf a sailboat,
Hawaii, even in the winter, is truly the land of an endless summer.
Let's rejoin Mike and Robert.
They've left Africa, traveled up through India, across the equator for the third time down to
Perth, Western Australia.
Let's hop on down there and see what's going on.
They met some of the local residents, and a few surfers too.
A group of Australian blokes took Mike and Robert with them on a surfing trip.
They drove over a thousand miles in four days looking for surf.
Everywhere they went they were greeted with a familiar cry... surfers have heard a thousand times each,
"You guys really missed it.
You should have been here yesterday."
The roads aren't the greatest in western Australia.
When there are no roads, they just commandeer a tractor and manure cart... and get to the beach that way.
Down to a place called Ocean
Beach near the little town of Denmark, Western Australia.
Beautiful, deserted beach, but not much surf this day.
They were thinking of hiking down to the beach to go surfing anyway... when they saw an all-too-familiar
Australian site. we call them sharks.
They Australians call them
"the men in the gray suits." whatever you call them, they like your body.
The place didn't look that red-hot anyway.
The only wave they found in four days of searching around Perth... was the three-inch wake of this little boat.
Mike riding the wake unattached.
The people on the boat said,
"Gee, Mike, you should've been here yesterday. we had a bigger boat."
He braved the shore break and came in.
They picked up some surplus
Australian army hats that they hoped would change their luck.
Maybe they'd have better luck and strike some good surf at their next stop...
2,000 miles across the Australian continent to Melbourne.
They were greeted by some local surfers... and lost no time in heading from the city of Melbourne to Bells Beach... about 60 miles away with high hopes of hitting some summer surf.
Down the dry, dusty dirt road to Bells Beach.
They pulled up on the bluff to get their first look at the famous Bells Beach surf... and were greeted with the cry,
"You guys really missed it.
You should've been here yesterday."
There wasn't much surf, so they just went down to the beach to meet some of the local blokes... and found out an interesting thing.
Bells Beach is the fly center of Australia.
You go onto the beach and there are 30 flies assigned to your body. when you leave, they go back to command headquarters... and wait for another assignment.
They met a young fella named Rodney Sumpter who told them,
"You didn't miss it yesterday.
You missed it by about six months.
Because it's during the wintertime we get the best surf at Bells, round about July."
He said,
"Remember that dry dirt road you came in on today? well, during the winter, it's not a dry dirt road anymore."
Rodney said the surf isn't the same either.
And obviously it isn't.
He told them of all the great days of surf... he and Nat Young had had riding Bells Beach.
Nat Young here, only 16 years old, and one of the very finest surfers in Australia.
The winter conditions in Melbourne in July are very similar... to the winter conditions in Southern California in December. water temperature between 55 and 60 degrees, and general conditions about the same.
But it's Bells Beach,
Melbourne, Australia.
Here goes Rodney Sumpter, our storyteller, and also a great young Australian surfer.
He, too, 16 years old.
"Yeah," said Rodney.
"Should've come in July."
Rodney knew what he was talking about, so they asked him if he'd ever been back to Perth... where they'd just come from.
Rodney laughed and said,
"Sure, I've been back there.
Heck, I'm 16 years old.
I've been almost everywhere."
And Rodney told Mike and Robert all about a trip... he and Nat made back to western Australia.
Only they made their trip during the wintertime.
They went to the exact beach
Mike and Robert had been to--
Ocean Beach, Denmark.
Only the day they arrived, they had good luck and struck some beautiful little curls.
It's very difficult to get good waves when you're traveling around.
If you live in an area, you're bound to get a number of good days a year.
But if you're just passing through for a day or a week, the chances are you won't strike a really good day.
Nat and Rodney were lucky at the same beach
Mike and Robert hadn't been.
The Australians are very competitive surfers.
They always like to do one better than "the yanks" as they call us.
So if you go out and hang five, they'll go out and hang 10.
You hang 10, they'll do one better, which is something like hang body.
"Yeah," said Rodney.
"It was a good trip.
"But don't worry.
You're headed for Sydney.
"There's good surf there quite often in the summer.
With a little luck, you'll strike it good."
With a little luck, they struck it bad.
Three-foot wind chop, one-foot waves and three inches of rain.
So they went down to the beach and met some of the local rogues.
Out of any group of surfers, there's always one who will say the same thing.
"You guys really missed it.
You should've been here yesterday."
By now,
Robert was ready to snap.
He said,
"wait a minute, buddy.
"If you were in Hawaii right now at Waimea Bay, it might really be big.
And when I say 'big,' fella,
I really mean big."
That's what Robert means-- really big.
In fact, when Waimea Bay in Hawaii gets big, it's a whole specialized part of surfing.
They'll sometimes sit and watch it for a couple of hours before going out.
If it gets too big and closes out, the closest place you can get ashore... is 20 miles away.
Special boards are used called "big guns."
You have to wait for a lull in the shore break... before you can even try to get out.
Sometimes you'll stand there for half an hour... waiting for a chance to get through this shore break.
People started to gather and watch as the surfers who made it out... to sit in groups and talk nervously in low tones... waiting for the first big set of waves.
It's not uncommon to see fire engines and ambulances on the beach. when the first big sets come marching through, out you paddle with your heart in your mouth.
Someone's gotta turn around and take off on the first wave.
Miki Dora did... and wished he hadn't.
Greg Knoll rode Waimea Bay with such aggressiveness, he earned himself the nickname of "The Bull," hanging on through unbelievable masses of white water.
Only a handful of surfers actually ride these big waves.
Some of them are sportsmen.
Some of them are nuts.
Waimea Bay on the North Shore of Oahu in Hawaii.
This will give you an idea of the fantastic power of these waves.
A surfboard is as buoyant as a cork.
It takes a tremendous amount of power to hold one underwater. when Dick Brewer gets wiped out, watch how long his surfboard gets held down.
You'll finally see it pop up in the upper right hand corner of the picture.
Imagine what his body's been doing under there all that time.
The most dangerous thing in a big wave... is to get hit with your surfboard or someone else's board.
A surfboard hurled with the force of one of these waves can cut you in half.
So the most common sight you see at Waimea is surfers diving off, trying to get away from their board underwater to safety.
They're diving in awkward positions-- literally diving-- to save their own lives. when you see one of these big waves letting down in front of you, your heart's beating so fast, you can do a standing broad jump of 15 feet... and not even know it.
Just paddling out can be a national disaster.
You take off, make the steep drop, hear the white water rumbling behind you and feel the spray on your back.
You see you're going to make it into the safety of the shoulder.
It feels like the happiest day of your life.
Waimea Bay has only been ridden since 1958... when the first group of surfers challenged it.
Yet surfers watched it break for 10 years before going out.
Can you imagine the courage it took to be the first?
If you could harness the power of one of these waves, you could light a city... for a week.
This one really putting on a display of power, shooting plumes of white water
40 feet in the air, almost defying humans to challenge it.
"Yeah, fella, you really missed it."
The guy said,
"well, we're going out surfing here. You wanna go out?"
Robert said,
"No. I don't think so."
The Aussie said,
"Well, some of the kids are going out anyhow."
"Some of the kids in Australia are too much."
Mike and Robert figured,
"Well, it's not that bad out there."
They might as well go out.
This is one of the girl surfers in Australia.
Her name is Pearl.
"Hi, Mike."
Her bathing suit is nothing unique down there.
Most of the girls wear the same kind of a suit.
There's another girl paddling out.
Same type.
Doesn't bother anybody.
But it bothered Robert, and it bothered Mike.
Robert had never done a spinner in his life. when the girls get wiped out, they have some trouble losing parts of these suits.
The darn things are so little they roll up in a ball and go down a clam hole or something... and they never find them again.
The lifeguards down there carry spare bathing suits.
Carry 15 in a Band-Aid box.
Mike Hynson and Robert August were quick to make friends... with the natives in any country they visited.
Pearl had to go home.
Mike was one of the last of the good guys, so he said he'd run her on home.
All Robert could say was,
"Ah, fudge."
Leaving Australia, we're headed 1,200 miles across the Tasman Sea... to New Zealand.
This is really a beautiful country, with high mountains and waterfalls.
It's about the size of California, but with only two million people.
There are 10 million sheep in New Zealand.
More sheep than people.
This is one of the beautiful
East Coast beaches.
Perfect conditions, but surf that rarely gets over three feet.
On the West Coast, it's a little more rugged.
The surf on the west Coast rarely drops below six feet.
The wind usually blows about 20 knots, making poor surfing conditions.
John Paine and Tim Murdoch, two New Zealand surfers we met-- they took us on a trip leaving from Tim's house near Auckland, heading to the extreme northeast tip of the island, a place called Ahipara.
Driving there Tim and John explained Ahipara was a well-known surfing spot.
A lot of people surf there.
Last year, they figured probably... three or four.
Here's the cove at Ahipara on the extreme northeast cape... of New Zealand's North Island.
Robert and John Paine paddling out for a wave... with horses clomping along the path in the background-- people coming in from the sheep ranch.
This is considered a fair sized day for New Zealand's East Coast.
That's part of a paddle wheel of an old steamship that went aground.
It's Christmastime in New Zealand right in the middle of their summer.
They think of Santa Claus as a guy who wears Bermudas and hangs out on the beach.
Tim and John went home to spend Christmas with their parents... and left Mike and Robert to explore New Zealand by themselves.
Heading from the East to West Coast, you pass through the mountains.
Mike and Robert stop to sample a little of the world-famous...
New Zealand trout fishing.
A pleasant way to spend a day, and also a good way to pick up something to eat.
They fished for a few hours and caught quite a few trout.
This is just a baby trout by New Zealand standards.
It only weighed about two pounds.
It has to be over two pounds to even be legal size.
Here's some of the regular fellers they caught.
Four and five pound rainbow and brown trout.
That evening, they had roast trout on a stick.
Page 44 of their woody woodchuck manual.
But it tasted pretty good.
They had enough fish for weeks.
They had trout for dinner, trout sandwiches for lunch, flaked trout in their mush in the morning, rotten trout.
They camped out that night in the mountains of New Zealand... and struck off the next morning for the west Coast... and a place called Raglan.
It's an amazing country to drive through.
One minute there's a cool mountain stream.
Around the corner, a thermal area with a pit of bubbling mud.
On down to Raglan on New Zealand's west Coast.
This is the huge cove at Raglan, many miles across and a couple of miles deep.
The lines of surf rapping in from the Tasman Sea.
It was blowing about 15 knots, which is considered fairly glassy for the west Coast. watch Mike catch his fin on a rock here just underwater.
Oop.
It was Christmas Day, and they had the huge cove at Raglan all to themselves.
The most unique thing about this place is the length of the ride.
The ride's so long it's ridiculous.
I can't even show you a complete ride.
It would take the whole second part of the film.
So I'll show you kind of highlights of one of Robert's rides.
This is about the middle part of the ride.
Later in the day, here's some more of the middle part of the ride.
Once the novelty of the long ride wears off, it gets kind of boring.
You start talking to yourself, reciting poetry, yodeling-- anything to keep your mind occupied.
This is the shore break.
It only lasts for about 15 minutes.
You go out surfing for the day at Raglan, you get two rides-- one after breakfast, and one after lunch.
If you try for three, you starve to death.
Surfers here don't carry wax.
They carry life-raft rations.
Mike and Robert riding it together in the afternoon... so they'd have someone to talk to.
Mike was discussing highlights of the trip.
Robert kept saying,
"watch where you're going, Mike.
If you fall off, you won't get in till tomorrow morning."
Drying off after the day of surfing in the afternoon summer sun of New Zealand, they remarked to each other how ironic their trip had been so far.
In Africa, where they really didn't expect to find surf, they found such good waves.
In Australia that has good surf, they'd been unlucky and hadn't gotten anything.
Here in New Zealand, they'd had a few pretty good days, but they knew it could've been even better.
That's what it's like when you're following the summer around the world... looking for places to surf.
Their next stop would be the island of Tahiti.
Ask anyone who's been there and they'll tell you the same thing-- there's no surf in Tahiti.
The reason they say is because this barrier reef... cuts up all the surf coming into the beach.
But it makes for crystal-clear waters in the lagoons.
This is about six feet of water we're flying over with coral and sand on the bottom.
Didn't take Mike and Robert long to get into the swing of things in Tahiti.
A flower behind that ear means they're not married.
And they kept hollering,
"Hey! I'm not married!"
Although there's no surf, they thought they'd go paddle in the lagoon.
And although there's no surf, they found something that looked kind of like a wave.
They called this place
"El Stumpo."
They named it El Stumpo after the famous
Polynesian explorer...
Leonardo El Stumpo.
The waves weren't gigantic, but they were well formed little devils.
You could see the waves breaking on the reef in the background.
There was a pass through the barrier reef, and the swells were coming through and breaking near the beach.
For such a tiny little wave, you could really get worked over.
Everyone said there was no surf in Tahiti, but they had already found some, so they thought they'd better drive around the island... and take a good look.
Off they went through the famous town of Papeete.
You get to one side of the island, and you find everyone's wrong.
There is surf in Tahiti.
There's no barrier reef at all on one side of the island.
There's all kinds of surf rolling into the black sand beaches.
Just a matter of finding the right beach... with the right bottom contours, the right swell direction, and you'll find a place to surf. we found an interesting spot. we called it "Ins and Outs"... because you could ride the wave in, or you could ride the wave out.
The wave going out had better shape than the wave did coming in, so they spent most of the time riding out.
The waves would roll in, up the steep beach, back down the steep beach and right back out to sea again.
Had enough shape and power-- you could turn, run the nose, just like you were riding in.
Except you weren't.
You were riding out.
The Tahitian kids had ridden out most of their lives, and they were busy riding in on their surf mats and belly boards.
But when they met the out part, shazam!
Three ways to go-- in, out and up.
Everyone inside was drowning.
Here's the Royal
Tahitian kid, Irving.
He's got the shiniest skin on the block.
Mike with a record long ride out at Ins and Outs, heading straight out to sea, straight toward Hawaii.
I couldn't help but feel sorry for the Tahitian kids having so much fun surfing.
They didn't know there was no surf in Tahiti.
This place got kind of confusing, so Mike and Robert paddled down the beach a few hundred yards... and found another surfing spot.
They called this other spot
"The Other Spot."
It was a pretty good spot too.
The best waves came through right in the middle of a rain squall.
It was kind of weird when it rained.
The rain was 75 degrees.
The water was 75 degrees.
The air temperature was 75 degrees.
It was so pleasant, it almost made you sick to your stomach.
The people in Tahiti were really insistent about there being no surf.
Mike came out of the water once and a man said, "Hey, there's no waves in Tahiti."
He'd been standing right there watching Mike surf.
Mike didn't want to be a smart aleck, so he just said,
"Well, sir, they're pretty good things, whatever you call 'em."
Here's Mike with a nice ride on a Tahitian thing.
On their last evening, they set out beyond the breaker line... and remarked to each other how ironic it had been again.
Here in Tahiti where there's not supposed to be any surf... they found three places,
El Stumpo, Ins and Outs, and the Other Spot.
Their next stop would be Hawaii.
On the plane, they were anxious to get to Hawaii.
They didn't have to look for surf anymore. They knew right where to find it.
Mike was itching to get his feet in a board in Hawaii and get a few waves.
It wasn't long before he did.
Good old Hawaii.
It sure was great to be back in the Islands.
No more searching for surf.
Just go out and ride in the warm blue water.
Good old Hawaii and the friendly natives.
And the junior birdmen.
Ooh! Oh!
Good old Hawaii and the dirty old nasty Pipeline.
This is the surfing spot that's hardly even a surfing spot.
It's more like a Roman gladiator's pit.
So dangerous, it almost defies description.
The way the waves break is bad enough.
But it's also very shallow, and on the bottom is coral.
Not the usual formation, but coral that sticks up like big overgrown railroad spikes.
You hang onto your board, you go over the falls with it every time, guaranteed.
Any wipeout at the Pipeline in Hawaii is a bad one.
And most places, when someone gets wiped out, everyone watching on the beach laughs.
No one laughs at the Pipeline.
They wait and see if you come up again.
No one laughed very hard when Bob Pike came out of the water... with a broken collarbone and three broken ribs... from bouncing off the shallow bottom.
You ride this place with a different attitude.
You don't want to fool around.
You want to make that wave more than anything in the world.
A surfer who rode the place better than anyone thought ever imaginable... was Butch Van Artsdalen.
The waves came marching through and Butch kept doing impossible things, getting impossible rides on impossible waves to ride.
It seemed like
Butch was invincible, like he could do nothing wrong, coming through one unbelievable tube after another, almost making this wave--
Not quite.
The wave hit his board dead-center, and Butch had two halves.
You can drive a car over a surfboard and it won't break.
But a wave at the Pipeline can easily snap one in half. when the collapsing wave squirts air and water out the end, it sounds like a jet plane taking off.
If you're standing there, you get blown right off your board.
There's so much adrenaline pumped through your system on a wave like this... that when you get to the shoulder, the easy part, you're so relieved, you just sometimes fall off in a semi faint.
The worst wipeout I've ever seen was Danny Derone at the Pipeline.
An upside-down, head-dip, human pile driver. watch this terrible wipeout.
Danny came up smiling, and we thought he'd snapped something loose in his head.
Mike and Robert, their first day back in Hawaii, and already they'd been into some good waves.
They'd be into some more good waves the next morning.
But they couldn't help but think back to the many things they'd already seen and done.
The animals, and especially the perfect wave they discovered and rode... at Cape St. Francis in South Africa.
They missed these things, but there wasn't a much better place to be than Hawaii.
In a couple of months when the season changed, they'd return with the summer season to their homes in California. with enough time and enough money, you could spend the rest of your life... following the summer around the world.
But for now, the endless summer must end.
This is Bruce Brown.
Thank you for watching.
I hope you enjoyed my film.
Okay, go ahead.
My name is Sidney Westerfeld.
I'm the owner of this antique tavern...
...Monmouth Valley, New York State.
I was here when this crowd really came.
We expected fifty thousand a day, and there must have been a million!
I, myself, was hungry for two days, because I couldn't get any food in.
I couldn't get out to buy any food.
I was eating cornflakes for two days!
And the kids were wonderful.
I have no kicks.
It was "sir" this and "sir" that, and...
..."thank you" this and
"thank you" that.
Nobody can complain about the kids.
This thing was too big.
It was too big for the world!
Nobody has ever seen a thing like this!
And when they see this picture in the news, over the moving pictures...
...they'll really see something!
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...because it's been a long time gone..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time. It's a long, long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Turn, turn any corner."
"Hear, hear, you must hear..."
"...what the people say."
"You know that something..."
"...is going on around here."
"But surely, surely, surely..."
"...one day I'm going to have my day."
"Oh, it appears to be a long, yes it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...ah-ha, such a long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Speak out, you've got to speak out..."
"...against the madness."
"You've got to speak your mind, yes, today..."
"...but don't, no, don't, don't try to get yourself elected."
"If you do, you'll have to cut your hair..."
"...and it appears to be a long, yes, it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time, such a long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...it's going to be a long time gone..."
"...but you know..."
"...the darkest hour..."
"...the darkest phase, is always just before the dawn..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long time..."
"...such a long, long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
Hey, Mike, what's the worst part of running one of these things?
The worst part?
What's the worst part of running one?
I don't know.
You dig it all?
I guess the biggest hassle is dealing with politics. You know.
Is there a lot of politics involved?
You mean with the cities?
And you got that solved?
Well, it looks that way.
How long did it take you to put it together. Two, three months?
Uh, been working on it for about nine months.
Nine months! Full time?
Are you in charge of the whole thing?
Yes.
But you got backers?
Partners and backers.
Where are you going to go from here?
I mean, are you going to do another one?
If it works.
Aw, you're really good tonight!
You know...
...this is the most outrageous spectacle
I've ever witnessed. Ever!
There's only one thing I wish.
I sure have to pee!
And there just is nowhere to go!
I believe we're "GOING UP THE
COUNTRY" a little bit right now.
"I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going to someplace, where I've never been before."
"I'm going, I'm going, where the water tastes like wine."
"I'm going where the water tastes like wine."
"We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"All this fussing and fighting, man, you know I sure can't stay."
"Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk.
You know we've got to leave today."
"Just exactly where we're going, I cannot say..."
"...but we might even leave the U.S.A."
"Because it's a brand new game and I want to play."
"No use in your running or screaming and crying..."
"...because you've got a home as long as I've got mine."
"If you smile at me,
I will understand..."
"...because that is something everybody, everywhere does in the same way."
"I can't see why you called a friend from the other side."
"There's just one thing
I've got to know..."
"...can you tell me who I am?"
"Say, can I have some of your purple berries?"
"Yes, I've been eating them six or seven weeks now."
"Haven't got sick once, probably keep us both alive."
"Wooden ships on the water..."
"...very free, easy, easy."
"You know, the way it's supposed to be."
"Silver people on the shoreline, let us be."
"Talking about very free and easy."
"All the ships that watch as you die..."
"...all they can do is echo your anguished cry."
"Still I go keep on feeling, why?"
"We are leaving. You don't need us."
What do you think?
Well, what could I think?
We're in the middle of the, of the situation and we make the best of it.
It's about all we can do.
We were standing on the curbs watching them come in, uh, last night.
All the townspeople.
It was just like a, an army invading a town. It's hard to believe.
Do you live here?
No, we're here for a vacation.
Are you having one?
We did, up until last night.
They kept us up for a while.
Who is they?
Freaks.
Is that what you call yourselves?
Sure.
Why?
Well, because that's what everybody else calls us.
What do you call yourself that for?
Because we admit it. Compared to everybody else, we're freaks.
I don't think you are. As long as you behave yourself, there's nothing wrong.
I'm not putting bad connotations on the word "freak", you know. I'm just...
Don't you think that the word "freak" itself has a bad connotation?
It's whatever you think about it.
Last time we saw anything like this was at the Rose Bowl Parade last New Year's.
That's right.
Like four ice cubes out of the bag, you know.
They wanted to buy four ice cubes?
Yeah, right.
I don't know, what can you charge them for ice cubes? You know.
It's a great shot in the arm to Sullivan
County, business-wise.
Something we needed.
As far as whether it will leave a favorable effect later, besides money...
...we'll know when the festival is over.
Uh, they're beautiful people.
Well is this festival affecting you in any way?
Well, it's kind of overwhelming us.
Put it this way.
In what way?
Just to take care of, to try to get the people fed,
I would say is one of the main objectives here.
I know all these young fellows here, they've got to be fed and they're going to get hungry.
I hope that they can bring enough supplies in for, for...
That seems to be the big trouble.
And traffic, that's... well, you know yourself without me telling you.
What's it done for business?
Oh, come on.
What's it done?
Increased it about what?
As much as you can do.
Put it this way. And more.
I'll say one thing for the young people.
They've been very nice.
All of them. So far.
It's really amazing. Yet it looks like some kind of Biblical, epochal...
...unbelievable scene!
They're all, you know, like all...
You see these cars, they're strewn on the sides of the roads from the helicopters and...
...in all different angles, you know. They look like jackstraws and stuff like that.
There is this continual flow of people just riding the stream.
They're going along and it...
Jerry, it was all frozen.
So let's enjoy. It was all I could get.
Well, I mean, I mean, from a practical point of view, what do you think, how could they limit this crowd?
They didn't want this many people here, really, I don't think.
So you find the control points at the beginning of the highways...
...and those with tickets are allowed in and those without tickets are not.
You have to have some control.
You know, when you have man-eating...
...Barabunda ants coming over a hill in South America...
...they want to cut them off and stop them from coming. They make a ditch...
...they put oil in the ditch and they make a flame.
Now I'm not saying they should put up flames to stop the people...
...but there has to be some way of stopping the influx of humanity.
Uh, in numbers, tell me, how many do you expect?
Two hundred thousand.
Two hundred thousand people here over the three days?
Where will you put them?
We have contracted for land surrounding the area...
...setting up camp grounds, water facilities, toilets, electric, food.
What does it cost to put one of these things together?
A fortune.
And I suppose the returns will also be good.
Yeah, we'll probably... I don't, I don't know what the returns will come up to...
...up to what it's cost or not, but...
...the point is that it's happening.
A couple of million dollars.
In other words, you have to make two million dollars to break even?
Well, if we're going to break even.
Huh, you know.
The point is that it's happened and it's working...
...and it's enough for now.
What is it that musicians have?
Are you a musician yourself?
What is it the musicians have that they can communicate so well to the kids?
Music!
I mean, they've always had music.
Music has always been a major form of communication.
Only now the lyrics and the type of music is a little bit...
...more involved in society than it was.
I need something now, let me tell you, to kind of run as a voice over... when I'm showing this music on...
If you could, if you could tell me...
...that I can run your voice over while this music is playing...
...what the music is saying, kind of, you know, what that's about.
It's about what's happening now...
...and if you listen to the lyrics and you listen to the, to the rhythm...
...and, and what's in the music...
...then you'll know what's, what's going on with the culture.
I've got to split.
Can we count on you?
Great, groovy. Thanks.
I'd like... Mike hangs out here.
I'd like to see a little bit of him.
Just natural sound, while he's getting harassed and bugged. Okay?
Now, goddamnit, I was going to call you last week!
That means you've got to call me and
I've got to get that thing into the air.
Now I'm going to order a five-passenger helicopter.
I'm really scared the roads are going to get jammed up.
If anybody wants anymore rooms...
...shows up with more people than they're supposed to have...
...tell them they can drop back fifteen yards and punt!
They've got about as much chance as a snow ball in hell...
...of getting a room closer than Middletown.
There's a Holiday Inn in
Middletown, New York.
Let's clear the road, please!
Peel back, peel back there!
Let them through.
Everything has room to flow here.
Please walk...
...on the grass.
Walk on the sides of the road if you're going to walk through here. Let's go.
How is it out there?
We apologize for the, uh, noise of the choppity-choppy, but...
...it seems there are a few cars blocking the road, so we're flying everybody in.
I almost made the worst pun in the world about high musicians, but we'll skip that.
You know Artie? Artie Kornfeld.
How you doing, man?
Good to see you, man.
Glad you could make the party.
It's going beautifully, man.
Wouldn't have it any other way.
It's really together.
Look at the way...
It really worked out nice, didn't it?
Looks fantastic!
The vibes are so beautiful.
Everybody helps everybody.
Today it feels so great right here, you know?
How can I ever live on the east side of Manhattan after this scene?
Yeah, man, it smells like strawberries!
It's perfume! Oh, it is!
"Just Like A Woman"...
...and "Let's Get Stoned."
We're in sync, but you can't hear a fucking thing...
...because of the fucking helicopters, so I'm going to quit!
Because of the fucking helicopters...
...I can't get a fucking piece of dialogue at all, man.
I'm hanging around blowing my brains out!
We're getting it tied up.
Two or three of the groups are in.
We're just trying to match up two groups and equipment and we'll be okay.
Can those of you in the back hear well?
Raise your hands please.
It's all right? Thank you.
Marijuana! Exhibit A.
Look at all those people!
The Daily News, in rather large headlines, still costing ten cents...
..."TRAFFIC UP TIGHT AT HIPPIE FEST."
See, if you see the, show the picture in India...
...they won't believe this is taken in America.
Because their impression of American children...
...and American ways is completely different.
All neatly dressed, put on hat and tie and sitting on chairs.
That's not like this at all.
Wheat Germ, Holly has your bag with your medicine.
Please meet at the information booth as soon as you can, please.
Helen Savage, please call your father at the Motel Glory in Woodridge.
The warning that I've received you might take it...
...with however many grains of salt you wish...
...that the brown acid that is circulating around is not specifically too good.
It is suggested that you stay away from that...
...but it's your own trip, so be my guest.
Please be advised there is a warning on the one, okay?
Sam, can you get the monitors on?
Get some more guys over here.
This is going to be the heavy side.
Richard Boch, get back to Eddie
Kramer in the sound truck.
- Watch your fingers right up there!
- Hold it.
Mr. Richie Havens!
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."

"That he fought, we'll be free.
Yeah, free!"
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of Birmingham?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with his hand rolled in a fist..."
"...marching to the Birmingham war."
"Hey, marching to the Birmingham war."
"Hey, what's the use of singing this song?"
"Some of you are not even listening."
"Tell me what it is we've got to do?"
"Wait for the bombs to start whistling?"
"Wait for the blitz to start blitzing?"
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."
"...and here comes a guided missile."
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."
"...I cannot hear it whistle!"
"I can almost hear its whistle, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
There are a hundred million songs going to be sung tonight.
All of them are going to be singing about the same thing...
...which I hope everybody who came, came to hear, really.
And it's all about you, actually.
And me and everybody around this stage and everybody that hasn't gotten here.
And the people who are going to read about you tomorrow.
And how really groovy you were.
All over the world.
If you can dig where that's at.
That's really where it's really at.
Guitar mike, please.
"Freedom! Freedom!"
"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child..."
"...a long way from home."
"Yeah, yeah, Lord..."
"...singing freedom! Freedom!"
"Sometimes I feel like
I'm almost gone..."
"...a long, long, long way, way from home."
"Clap your hands!"
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."
"...and I can call him up from my heart."
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."
"...and I can call him up from my heart..."
"...when I need my brother!"
"When I need my father! "
"Mother!"
"Sister!"
"When I need my brother!"
"Brother! Hey! Mother! "
"Mr. Richie Havens."
What better way to start than with the beautiful "Richie Havens."
It's worth it.
Just to see the lights go on last night, man!
Just to see the people stand up, man, it makes it worth it.
I mean, I feel there will be people, you know...
...there are people out there that really don't dig it.
Very few of them.
But you know, it really is to the point where it's just a family, man.
All box office people please go to the main box office.
We don't need it any more.
Somebody unplugged the lines, man.
Let's have a hot mike.
Number two, number three.
You are not giving the world's greatest three day freebee!
Okay, there's only one way to do it.
There's a way to do it, man.
There is no way.
The only way to do it is to get into a rap with...
It's okay. Come here. Come here.
This is one thing I was going to wait a while before we talked about it.
But maybe we'll talk about it now so you can think about it.
It's a free concert from now on!
That doesn't mean that anything goes.
What that means is...
...we're going to put the music up here for free.
What it means is that the people who are backing this thing...
...who put up the money for it, are going to take a bit of a bath.
A big bath. There's no hype, that's true. They're going to get hurt.
But what it means is that these people have it in their heads...
...that your welfare is a hell of a lot more important...
...and so is the music, than a dollar.
Look, when they hook the electricity up, a great jolt runs all the way through here.
If you've got the ticket, you disconnect the circuit and...
...otherwise you disintegrate.
Wendy and Mayar... , Maynard...
...from Fair Lawn, please meet
Jill in front of the stage.
George has a slight problem.
He broke his arm.
Oh, it's on Forty-second Street. Tiny Tim used to sing there. Did you know that?
Under the name of Robert, uh, Love.
Larry Love!
Could I get the picture, too?
Oh, yes. Toot too, too, too.
Tell me, little girl, what's your name?
My name is Beth Riley, and what's yours?
My name is Hugh.
How do you do? My name is Sue.
I'll see you around.
Ah, here they come, here they come.
My name is Hugh Romney. I'm with the
Hog Farm. And I'm working on a scene.
Some people call it bum trips. I don't think there is such a thing as a bum trip.
We're working with hobo voyages.
A half an hour after we release anybody from our section...
...we turn them into doctors...
...and they care for people that were tripping like they were when they came in.
Now people have been saying that some of this acid is poison.
It's not poison, it's just bad acid.
It's manufactured poorly.
If you can find out who it is, we...
Anybody who thinks they've taken some poison, forget it.
And if you feel like experimenting, only take half a tab. Okay? Thank you.
You know, the Japanese made that motorcycle.
The Japanese affected that thing over there...
...with the yellow robes, or the Indian.
Really does a lot for the music that motorcycle.
Who's on?
A guy named Bert Sommers.
I think Timmy Hardin is going on next.
So the order of everything just went kaplooey?
You're closing tonight, honey.
Maybe there'll be a few more people here by then.
I don't like a puny gathering like this.
I'd like to sing you a song that is one of my husband, David's, favorite songs.
And let me just tell you that he is fine. And...
...and we're fine too.
And David was just shifted from the county jail...
...which is very much of a drag, to Federal prison...
...which is kind of like a big summer camp...
...after you've been in county jail long enough.
See I just, just now got a letter.
I have it with me. About the trip from the county jail. Manacles on his legs...
...and his arms manacled to his belt.
Well, I mean, it's all worth writing about.
He doesn't care, you know.
And there's only one time that...
...where the first time he felt afraid in the whole thing, was a couple of...
...I guess guards, or something, they started talking very loud.
And he started saying...
...talking about the last draft case that they had been through...
...and "that motherfucker," and "we'll get you, motherfucker," you know?
He just prayed a little bit harder.
He wouldn't do anything anyhow, but it's not a very comfortable feeling.
But nothing has happened.
Anyway, this is, this is an organizing song.
And I'm, I was happy to find out that...
...after David had been in jail for two and a half weeks...
...he already had a very, very good hunger strike...
...going on with forty-two federal prisoners...
...none of whom were draft people.
"I dreamed I saw Joe
Hill last night..."
"...alive as you and me."
"Sez I, 'But Joe, you're ten years dead!"'
"'I never died, ' said he."
"'The copper bosses killed you, Joe!"'
"'They shot you, Joe, ' says I."
"'Takes more than guns to kill a man'..."
"Says Joe, 'I didn't die!"'
"And standing there as big as life..."
"...and smiling with his eyes."
"Says Joe, 'What they can never kill,"
"...went on to organize."'
"From San Diego up to Maine..."
"...in every mine and mill..."
"...where working men defend their rights..."
"...it's there you find Joe Hill!"
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming to carry me home."
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Well, I looked over yonder..."
"...and what did I see..."
"...coming to carry me home?"
"Saw a band, a band of angels..."
"...were a-coming for me..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Swing low..."
"...swing low, sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry me on home. Home!"
"See me,"
"feel me,"
"touch me,"
"heal me."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"Right behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get the heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"From behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Now, I'm a-gonna raise a fuss.
Now, I'm going to raise a holler..."
"...about a-working all summer, just to try and earn a dollar."
"Well, I went to the boss, said, 'I've got a date."'
"The boss said, 'No dice, son.
You've got to work-a late."'
"Sometimes, I wonder what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
"Well, my mom and poppa told me,
'Son, you've got to earn some money..."'
"'... if you want to use the car to go riding next Sunday."'
"Well, I didn't go to work.
I told the boss I was sick."
"Says they, 'You can't use the car, because you didn't work a lick."'
"Sometimes I wonder what
I'm a-gonna do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
"I'm going to take two weeks, going to have a fine vacation."
"Going to take my problems to the United Nations."
"Well, I went to my Congressman.
He said..."
"'... l'd like to help you, son, but you're too young to vote."'
"Sometimes I wonder what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
Ladies and gentlemen...
...The Who!
The word I get is that...
...maybe the best thing for everybody to do...
...unless you have a tent or some place specific to go to...
...just carve yourself out a piece of territory...
...say goodnight to your neighbor...
...and say thank you to yourself for making this the most peaceful...
...most pleasant day anybody has ever had in this kind of music.
Well, music is a thing that...
Well, you're obviously not here for the girls.
Oh, that's good, that's a basic thing, you know, like...
...there are a lot of girls here and they're probably...
...a lot freer than, you know, other places.
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of balling.
Well, you bring your own coals to Newcastle?
Are you two going together or are you just hitching together?
We've lived together for about four months, or five months.
You know, with a lot of other people.
Kind of what you'd call...
...a communal thing, or someone else would call a communal thing.
But it's just, we just live together...
...and so we just decided to come down together because we were coming here.
And like there's nothing, I mean, no definite thing about...
We're not necessarily going to be together throughout the whole thing.
So you're not particularly jealous of him?
Are you two going together?
But you two came up here together.
You like that?
Yeah, I like her.
I love her. I enjoy her.
What do you think about all this?
Well, the way I look at it...
...like I've known Jerry for what?
Four or five, six months now.
When he moved into the family group...
...that I was alr... that I already knew for quite a while...
...in that time, I got to know him real well and I learned to love him.
Like, you know, we ball and everything, but...
...it's really a pretty good thing because
I have plenty, there's plenty of freedom.
Because if we're not going together and we're not in love or anything like that...
Can you communicate with your parents?
I can communicate with them on, on one level.
Now that I've been away from home for two years.
But at first it was very rough.
Now...
...they, you know, they're beginning to mellow about it.
It's not so hard on them I'm the way I am.
But I can't really communicate to them...
...about anything that's really important because they just could not understand it.
My mother is really, she really...
...lives in a lot of pain...
...because she's sure I'm going to go to hell and there's nothing I can do...
...to tell her that there is, that it just does not exist for me.
So I, there's no communication on, on those levels.
My father was asking whether I was in a communist training camp or something...
...in, in the house that I lived in.
I could understand, you know, where he came from. Because when he...
...well, he's an immigrant, you know.
And so he came over here to better himself...
...economically and so forth, and all that other rot.
And, to make it better for me and he can't understand why I didn't play, you know...
...saying, "Why aren't you playing the game?"
"Here's all this opportunity.
Here's, here are all these things...
...which have so much value."
But they only have value to him...
...and he can't understand why they don't have value to me.
But he does have wisdom enough to know, to allow me to be who I am.
I guess he had some kind of idea in his head that...
...I will, by doing what I'm doing, learn for myself how to live.
And that's what he wants me to do, anyway.
So he, he can't understand why I am the way I am...
...but he, he very much wants me to be that way.
Because he knows that's the only thing for me.
He started his trip when he was four years old.
Really?
Nothing to do with drugs or anything?
Me, neither.
Do you think that's a cop-out or...?
I, I don't know. I, I used to be into drugs and...
...I was very heavy on drugs, but...
...now it seems like it's almost contrived.
It's like drugs and revolution and the united front and all.
You know, I'm a human being and that's all I want to be. And I don't...
...I don't want to have a mass change...
...because a mass change only brings around mass insanity.
I just want to be myself and find out, find a place where I can...
...maintain some kind of balance within myself, you know.
I'm kind of like the Hamlet trip, you know. To be or not to be.
Do you think you could ever communicate with a guy like Nixon or Westmoreland?
I hope so.
They're doing their thing, aren't they?
I don't know. It's like they, they're neurotic or psychotic or...
...having fun as they say in
Life Mag... I don't know.
They could say the same thing of you.
Yeah, right. But it's not true, because,
I, I don't need all that power, you know.
Where I can just, I can just sit here right on this roadside...
...and I, I don't have to become
President of the United States.
And I don't have to go all that way up.
I don't have to make the climb.
Because there's nothing to climb for.
It's all sitting right here.
Do you have tickets to this thing?
No.
How are you going to get in?
I don't really know.
I figured, you know, once I got here...
...l'd see whatever happens and go along with it.
It's like people that are nowhere are coming here...
...because there are people they think are somewhere...
...so everybody is really looking for, you know, for some kind of answer.
Where there isn't one.
Why would three hundred thousand...
...or a hundred and twenty thousand sixty thousand...
...seventy thousand people come to anything just because it's music?
I mean, was music all that important?
I don't really think so.
People don't know, they don't know how to live and they don't know what to do...
...and they think that if they...
...can come here they can find out.
You know, what it is...
...or how to maintain with it.
It's just like people are very lost, I think.
America leads the whole world in several ways.
Very recently, when
I was in the East...
...the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi...
...met me and asked me...
...what's happening in America?
And I said,
"America is becoming a whole."
"America is helping everybody..."
"...in the material field..."
"...but the time has come for
America to help the whole world..."
"...with spirituality, also."
"At the hop..."
"...we can rock to and fro and never let go, at the hop, hop, hop."
"When the records are playing, people eat a lot of chicken..."
"...at the hop, hop, hop."
"If you've got a little chicken, share it with your baby, at the hop, hop, hop."
"Oh, baby, hop! Let's go to the hop.
Oh, baby, let's go to the hop."
"Oh, baby, let's go to the hop!
Oh, baby, let's go to the Hop!"
"Well, let us go now. Let's go to the hop. Let's go to the hop, oh, baby!"
"Let's go to the hop, oh, baby.
Let's go to the hop."
"Go, go, let's go to the hop!
Let's go, go!"
"We will go rocking and rolling and stomping at the hop!"
"When the records are playing and the women start a-singing at the hop!"
"Oh, let's go now.
Let's go to the hop! "
"Let's go to the hop, oh baby.
Let's got to the hop, oh baby."
"Come on, let's go to the hop.
Hop!"
Ladies and gentlemen, the Sha-Na-Na!
Harold, turn up the mike.
Now, very slowly, start coming back up.
Lower the lock and pull yourself back up.
And then keep breathing as fast as you can.
Then exhale.
And relax. Then just feel the energy.
These, these are all beginning exercises of Kundalini Yoga.
Yoga means union.
It's the same energy force that drugs give you with a rush.
Right? It's, it's the same channels...
...only drugs do it for you and this way you can do it yourself.
You can do it when you want to...
...and you don't have to score to be able to do it.
All you've got to score is some clean air.
I learned it in Los Angeles.
And there was only a couple of months of clean air when I was learning it.
That's hard, too, these days.
But while there's still some clean air left, it would be groovy to...
...experiment with it like those guys who have been experimenting for...
...at least six thousand years and getting very high behind it.
The Kundalini nerve, it's called the nerve of awareness.
You can't dissect it. It's a current that runs up the center of your spine.
I don't know if any of you have ever sat down...
...and crossed your legs and smoked
DMT and watched what happens.
But what happens to me is this big thing...
...goes "uuurrrah" up my spine!
And flashes in my brain!
Well apparently, that's what is going to happen if I do this stuff and learn it.
It takes years, I guess, but this is the beginning of it.
These exercises are exercises to create...
...those channels in your body and to free your body of blocks.
The major block is your solar plexus.
That's why we're doing a lot of breath of fire.
It loosens the solar plexus.
And there are blocks in your spine and...
...back and wherever you've got blocks, to keep that energy from flowing.
Go within yourself and meditate on each breath.
Make each breath a complete breath.
And if you do it right, you'll be flashing momentarily.
Just keep up, concentrate on your breathing and hold that position.
Roll your toes forward so they point forward.
We're going to leave you with the usual thing.
Only thing I can say, as I said to so many people, this title, just about...
...puts it all into focus. It's called
"With A Little Help From My Friends."
Remember it.
"What would you do if
I sang out of tune..."
"...would you stand up and walk out on me?"
"Lend me your ears and
I'll sing you a song."
"I will try not to sing out of tune, yes."
"Oh, I'll get by..."
"...with a little help from my friends."
"Well, I never come up alive."
"Hey, there are so many ways."
"Well, I'm going back there for my friends."
"What do I do when my love is away?"
"Does it worry you to be alone?"
"Ho, no, no."
"How do I feel at the end of the day?"
"Are you sad because you're on your own?"
"I'll tell, never say it any more."
"Going to get a little help from my friends."
"I've got to buy favors for them."
"Don't bother about the love I gave."
"Help me find my way."
"Do you need anybody?"
"Oh, I need someone to love."
"Could it be anybody?"
"Oh, I need somebody..."
"...to dream about. I know her."
"Oh, I love her."
"Well, I'm going there,
I'm going there."
"Then I'm going to say that I'll know my way."
"Don't you know I care for my friends?"
"Would you believe in a love at first sight?"
"I'm sure that it happens all the time."
"You know it does."
"What do you see when you turn out the light?"
"I don't see nothing."
"I told you I get a lift, I've got to have a lift from my friends."
"Nobody cares the way I feel now."
"Oh, I sat there all alone."
"Do you need anybody?"
"Oh, Lord, I don't need anybody."
"Could it be that you're lonely?"
"Oh, Lord, I love her. I'll stand by."
"Going to dream about her, I know I am."
"Somebody said, 'Oh, I love her'."
"I've got to get my friends, I've got to get my friends to go..."
"Don't you know I said, there before your eyes...?"
"...l've got to get my friends together."
"All I've got to do is that now."
"I'm going to take them home with me now."
"You've got to get all your friends now."
"...you've got to get all your friends now."
"Nobody goes away..."
"...nobody goes away, yeah."
"You've got your friends, you've got your friends..."
"...you've got your friends, yeah."
"With a little help from my friends."
"Got to have love from my friends."
The Grease Band and myself thank you all very much, indeed.
See you again! Beautiful!
It looks like we're going to get a little bit of rain, so you better cover up.
If it does and if we should have any slight power problems...
...just cool it out. We'll sit here with you. It will be okay.
All right, everybody, just sit down, wrap yourself up.
We're going to have to ride it out.
Hold on to your neighbor, man.
Please get off those towers!
We don't need any extra weight on them!
Please move away from the towers.
The lamps might give us a problem.
Everybody who is in the back, please move back.
We have to get away from these towers.
Please move away from the towers!
Put the mike stands down on the floor.
Cover all the equipment.
Let's keep it nice and cool.
We'll be back with Country Joe in just a second as soon as we get set up.
Okay, so come on down off the towers.
Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain! Yeah.
Please move away from the towers.
Jody, get off the stage.
The wind is blowing this way.
Please be on this side of the towers.
Everyone in the back, please move back.
Just take it calm and easy.
I see it. Please move away from the towers.
I think the wind has run through it.
It is okay?
Give us some room. Go slowly, but move back. It will be cool.
Just move away from those towers!
We don't want one of those lamps to be blown. Please!
That's it. Everybody just help get away from the towers and clear them.
And look up, very seriously. Let's think hard to get rid of it, please.
No rain! No rain! No rain!
Keep thinking it!
Keep your eyes on those towers.
It's going to blow through.
Try and keep yourselves comfortable.
And keep an eye on the towers.
Hey, cut the power off up there, all right?
What do you want?
We're going to have to turn off some microphones for a minute.
Hang in there with us.
God bless you and watch those towers.
Let me get down with the mike.
Oh, can I talk to you a minute?
Sure. What do you want to know?
Do you like the rain?
Yes, yes. It's nice.
It, it gets you clean.
What are you thinking about?
Does, is this encouraging, or what?
Definitely not. It's great! Just a little added attraction, that's all.
You, at least, you don't have to wait for clothes to get dry.
Groovy! I dig it! I dig it!
Do you think it's coming off well with all those fuck-ups, or what?
Yes. The only, the only hassle is the mud, that's all.
Does this discourage you at all?
Or is it all right?
Mud. A drag!
I can't believe it!
Do you feel discouraged at all, or is this all right?
It's a bummer!
It's fine.
Peace, brother!
I've got something to say.
I want to know how come the Fascist pigs have been seeding the clouds?
Right! For the last hour and a half.
Going over twice with that, with all...
...with all the smoke coming out of them, seeding the clouds.
I want to know, know why that stuff is going down there.
And why doesn't the media report that stuff to the people?
You want to talk about what's happened?
I'm telling you these planes...
...come over an hour and a half and they seeded all the clouds.
This is the second time they did it today!
I don't know what they hope to prove, man.
What's going on here?
Sharon Silverstein, return home immediately.
Your father has been taken for open heart surgery.
Please stop at the information booth right away.
The first Aquarian Exposition.
The forecast for this afternoon is...
...intermittent entertainment between intermittent showers.
Somebody was saying this is the second largest city in New York.
There's been no police.
There's been no trouble.
If you check the statistics out...
...you'll find that...
...these people have lived, over three hundred thousand people...
...have lived together peacefully, loving each other...
...feeling for each other, want, needing for each other...
...and wanting to make this the experience it is.
What are they doing?
They're dropping dry, they're dropping flowers and dry clothes.
Out of that helicopter?
You said a moment ago that this wasn't the end of this festival...
...that this was a beginning.
What do you mean, a beginning?
Well, well, look at it!
This is the beginning of this kind of thing.
This culture and generation, away from the old culture and the older generation.
And you see how they function on their own.
Without cops, without guns, without clubs, without hassle.
Everybody pulls together and everybody helps each other and it works.
It's been working since we got here.
And it's going to continue working.
And no matter what happens when they go back to the city, this thing happened.
And it proves that it can happen.
That's what it's all about, you know.
That's the whole thing right there.
Mr. Kornfeld, was, was this a suc... , a financial success?
From the point of view of the fellows that put it on?
It was a financial disaster!
Why do you say that?
Well, we just opened the gates and let everybody in. It's a free festival...
...paid for by the people who put up the money...
...or the people that are going to have to pay it back?
Uh, paid for by the people who bought the tickets.
The two hundred thousand, of which I don't know how many of them got here.
No, this was paid for by, by all the people that bought it.
By all the people...
...that had the thought that put it to the point, to get us in a position...
...to just be a tool, like, like a vehicle...
...like everybody else.
Just to get it to this point.
You're in the red?
Oh? The company?
Financially? If you tried to think in those terms...
...when you're talking about something like this...
...financially, this is a disaster.
But you, you, you look so happy!
I'm very happy!
You can't buy that for anything!
Sure, this is really beautiful, man!
These people are communicating with each other.
That, that rarely happens anywhere anymore.
It has nothing to do with money.
It has nothing to do with tangible things.
You have to realize the turnabout...
...that I've gone through in the last, in the last three days.
In the last three million years that I, meaning us, all of us...
What do you mean, the turnabout in the last three days?
Just to see, just to really realize, what's really important.
The fact that, that if we can all live together and be happy...
...if you have to be afraid to walk out in the street...
...if you have to be afraid to smile at somebody...
...what kind of a way is that to go through this life?
Marijuana!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Waters, Country Joe and The Fish!
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
We're certainly delighted to be here today.
I'd like to start off my portion of the show...
...by giving you a taste of a little something we call...
...rock and soul music.
"Oh, your love is like a rainbow..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, darling. Now..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, I said..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, all around my shoulders, yeah..."
"...performing all around my shoulders."
"You know that your love is like a rainbow..."
"...falling all around my shoulders.
And I said I love you..."
"...you know I do!"
A lot of freaks!
"Coming in from London from over the Pole..."
"...flying in a big airliner..."
"...chickens flying everywhere around the plane."
"Could we ever feel much finer..."
"...coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys?"
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"A guy with a ticket to Mexico..."
"...no, he couldn't look much stranger..."
"...walking in a hall with his things and all..."
"...smiling, said he was the Lone Ranger."
"Coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys."
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"There's a hip woman walking on a moving block..."
"...tripping on the escalator."
"There's a man in the line, she's blowing his mind..."
"...thinking that he's already made her."
"Coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys."
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"Coming in from London from over the Pole..."
"...flying in a big air liner..."
"...chickens flying everywhere around the plane."
"Could we ever feel much finer?"
Folk music has come a long way hasn't it, Arlo?
It used to be the walk down the road trip, you know.
It's incredible. I heard the
New York Throughway is closed.
This morning we heard they were backed down...
...on Route Seventeen with an eight hour delay!
Right. Well, the New York
State Throughway is closed.
It's incredible!
Isn't that far out?
I don't know if you,
I don't know how many...
...of you can dig how many people there are, man!
Like I was rapping to the fuzz.
Huh, can you dig it?
Man there are supposed to be a million and a half people here by tonight!
Can you dig that?
New York State Throughway is closed, man!
Yeah, it's far out, man!
Hey, man, I've just got to say...
...that you people...
...have got to be the strongest bunch of people I ever saw.
Three days, man, three days!
We just love you!
Tell them who we are.
They'll know if you just sing.
Test. Forty-nine. Sixty-five.
Hike!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome with us Crosby, Stills and Nash!
"It's getting to the point..."
"...where I'm no fun any more."
"I am sorry."
"Sometimes it hurts..."
"...so badly, I must cry out loud."
"I, I, I am lonely."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Remember what we said and did..."
"...and felt about each other."
"Oh, babe, have mercy."
"Don't let the past remind us of what we are, not now."
"I, I, I am not dreaming."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Tearing yourself away from me now."
"You are free, and I am crying."
"This does not mean I don't love you."
"I do. That's forever, baby."
"Yes, and for always."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret."
"Are you still listening?"
"Here is the lock and latch of the key to your heart."
"Yes, and I love you."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard, hard..."
"...and you make it hard, you make it hard."
"Friday evening..."
"...Sunday in the afternoon..."
"...what have you got to lose?"
"Tuesday morning..."
"...please be gone. I'm tired of you."
"What have you got to lose?"
"Can I tell it like it is?"
"Listen to me, baby..."
"...it's my heart..."
"...that's a sad feeling in your heart, and that's what I am."
"I've got an answer."
"I'm going to try and play."
"What have I got to lose?"
"Please come see me..."
"...Thursdays and Saturdays."
"What have you got to lose?"
"Chestnut brown canary..."
"...ruby-throated sparrow..."
"...sing a song, don't be long, thrill me to the marrow."
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."
"Ring around the moonlight."
"Asking me, said she so free..."
"...'How can you catch the sparrow?"'
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."
"Oozing life, not lamenting."
"Change my life, make it right.
Be my lady."
Thank you. We needed that!
This is our second gig.
This is the second time...
...we've ever played in front of people, man!
We're scared shitless!
That's near enough for jazz.
I'd like to say thank you again to you.
This is a thing called
"I'm Going Home by Helicopter."
"Going home, my baby."
"My baby, baby, I'm going home."
"Baby, baby, I'm going home."
"Baby, baby, I said I'm going home."
"Going home, my baby."
"Go home, my baby."
"'Go home, baby, I'm going."
"My baby, see my baby around."
"See my baby, see my baby around."
"Love you, baby,
I feel so good tonight."
"Going home, see my baby."
"I'm going home now, see my baby."
"Oh, baby, baby, see my wife."
"Ohh! Baby, going to have more fun."
"Baby, you don't go..."
"...baby, if we don't go..."
"If you don't go..."
"...baby, we don't go.
Man, you hurt me so."
"I love my baby with the red dress on."
"I'm going to shake it on a great big doll. I'm going to have more fun."
"Go back, baby, baby, I want to be a half with you."
"I love you, baby, Lord knows I do."
"I love you, baby, God knows I do."
"We're going steady, doll, that's what we're trying to do."
"Go on, baby, I love that way you walk."
"One for the money, two for the show.
Three to get ready, and go, cat, go, go!"
"Don't you step on my blue suede shoes."
"You can do anything, baby, but lay off my blue suede shoes!"
"Well, back it up, down in front."
"I've got a baby, mean as she can be."
"Not now, my baby, don't be mean to me."
"Yeah, I'm coming on, baby.
Oh, not sitting, going home."
"Climbing on, baby. Oh, I'm not sitting, going home."
"Well, baby, I'm not sitting.
Going home."
"Well, shake up, baby, shake.
Well, shake it, baby, shake."
"Shake up, baby, shake.
Shake, baby, shake."
"Well, love you, baby.
I love the way you walk to me."
"Oh, baby, I love that way you walk."
"I'll sit you right down, knock you off your feet."
"Whoa, baby, I've got a craving."
"I love you, baby, like God knows I do."
"Take your love, baby, yeah, one more time."
"Oh, do the stomp, do the stomp."
"I gave my baby, I gave one more time."
"Yeah, you quit, I'm going to see my baby."
"I'm going home.
Home to see my ba-baby."
"Oh, baby, I played the blues for you."
"Yeah, I love you, baby, with your red dress on."
"Baby, I love you so."
"I'm going home, I'm going home."
"Love you, baby.
Love that way you walk."
"I'm going home."
"Love you, baby. I'm going home."
"Look out, baby! I'm coming to get you!
One more time! Going home! "
"Yeah, home, baby.
Going home, home to my baby."
"Going home. I'm going home.
I'm going home."
"I'm going home, home, home, my baby."
"Going home to see my mama!"
Ten Years After!
Please a warm thank you for Ten Years After!
Alright friends, now you have seen the heavy groups...
...now you will see morning maniac music.
Believe me.
It's a new dawn.
The regular guys.
Don't you get a dial tone, or anything?
Yeah, there are some toilets around here, some of those rolling outhouses...
...like they had in Newport.
You ask for somebody that doesn't exist...
...and then they don't accept the charges and they know you're okay.
You cheat the telephone company.
Oh, yeah. I'm fine, man.
We don't take the car. We walk.
It's the only way to get there.
Why? Because my mother wants to make sure I'm all right.
I'm going to call my mother and father because...
...oh, they think this is going to be like another Chicago.
Like I'm going to get my head beaten in.
They're terrified. So I'm going to call and tell them...
..."Ha-ha, I fooled you. I'm alive!"
They've got, they've, you don't even have to bother bringing your tickets...
...or anything, because they're not going to collect them.
There's no way they can.
They've got a fence that's half up...
...and there are people just sitting in that field.
It's really beautiful.
I'll try. It's like I say, really, you know how crowded it is here.
It, it's just swarming! What?
Out, out on the ground.
It was nice. We got wet.
All I miss is the bathtub.
Okay. Goodbye.
I didn't even finish dialing and they said...
It's so great in some ways and so lousy in others.
Look at the people you're meeting.
Everybody is here for one purpose.
It's ridiculous!
It's getting worse every time.
There is no water. No water, no food and no medical supplies.
Why don't we pray for rain?
They're telling everybody to go home.
They called it a disaster area.
Oh, that's rot!
They called this a disaster?
You should see, everybody's happy!
Who are you calling?
My mother.
Somebody may have noticed, or all of you may have noticed...
...a familiar colored helicopter over there.
The United States Army has lent us some medical teams...
...and giving us a hand.
They're with us, man.
They are not against us.
They're here to give us all a hand and help us.
And for that they deserve it.
There are forty-five doctors or more.
I know at least forty-five...
...who are here without pay because they dig what this is into.
Look, it's acid and shit like that.
One kid died, a heroin overdose.
Yeah, another guy died.
Run over, I believe.
The army is really doing a great job, you know.
All those guys calling them pigs and shit like that, it's not right.
They've done a good job.
Dr. Jack Maitland, please, with full suturing equipment...
...your presence is requested.
You've got a delivery to make!
Marilyn Cohen. Wherever you are, Marilyn Cohen...
...Greg wants you to meet him at the information booth...
...because he wants to marry you!
There goes Marilyn!
About how long does it take to...?
Well, before it was backed up, eight hours.
And they've been working at it and there are still some cats...
...that think they can come here for Sunday.
And they're stopping them in Monticello and all that, you know...
...so it's really getting to be a mess.
So, you know what I would do?
I would wait, because this way...
There's no gas in the gas stations.
Because this is the third largest city in the world.
So I would wait, you know?
Until when?
Until this traffic starts clearing up.
You know, like Monday morning.
I've got to be in North
Carolina Monday morning.
Oh, wow! Do you? Why? A job?
Well, like what? This has been declared a disaster area.
Because I called long distance to Buffalo...
...and asked some cats there and they said...
...it definitely has been declared a disaster area.
Is there any way to get out?
They're trying to evacuate it today.
So maybe late tonight, you know.
You know, like one.
How are they going to evacuate?
We're not sure. I think they're trying to get all the cats in the cars...
...and just direct the cars to get out.
I mean, you can try it.
I mean, like it's all up to you, man.
But if your car gets, you know...
Yeah, if you run out of gas somewhere, there's no gas in the stations.
You're screwed.
Yeah, I mean, like you'd be even more stuck on the highway...
...than you are here, because...
...at least here there are a lot of other cats.
I have to get out of here because there are just too many people!
And I can't leave because my friends will be lost.
And I can't, I can't stay here any more. It's too crowded!
We are only taking drastic emergencies.
Nobody worries. Nobody up here has any money.
You could live and eat here a week without money, so don't worry about it.
I know, but I've got to go back to California.
You can get a ride to California, too.
You know, everybody here, it's the same thing with them, you know.
You just have to dig it and live with it.
About thirty hours, at least.
Thirty hours straight? No naps?
Are you on speed?
No, I'm not on anything.
Blind faith?
Blind Faith is a groovy group.
You wouldn't believe some of the kids that come in here.
They're really spaced out. Last night, this cat, this cat comes in and says...
..."If anger is red and envy is green, what color is jealousy?"
And I mean he's really spaced out!
And you just don't go fucking people's heads up when they're spaced out!
So I said, uh, "Black, right?
Because jealousy is poison."
He says, "Yeah, but it's got to be something else than that."
And I said, "Green, because after all, jealousy is like envy."
"Except that envy is over things and jealousy is over people."
"A lot of people treat other people as, you know, things."
And he says, "Wow! Groovy!"
And he walks off and I never saw that cat!
Another cat comes up and he asks me to tell him about his wild eyes!
Did he have wild eyes?
He was speeding. Really groovy.
And all the people that come up here asking, you know...
...if we can page their freaked out friends.
I mean, like right now
I'm missing my sister.
I lost her. She was on, uh, on mesc.
And I lost her during
Richie Haven's performance.
I've got her tickets home.
I haven't seen her since.
She's all right.
Sure she is.
It's just that I'd like to see her so I can get home in time.
She's got to be back Monday for Court.
Otherwise, you know, I wouldn't care.
Otherwise, I'd probably let her hitch home.
City McGee...
...please come immediately to backstage right.
I understand your wife is having a baby.
Congratulations!
John Sebastian!
This is really a mind fucker of all times, man!
I've never seen anything like this, man!
It's Newport, right? But they owned it.
It was something else!
Just love everybody around you, and clean up a little garbage...
...on your way out and everything is going to be all right.
And Chip. My man, Chip.
Aw, you're doing so well, man.
He says to look out for the fence, too, man. You have to look after the fence.
Like the, the press can only, can only say bad things unless there ain't no fuck-ups.
And it's looking like there ain't going to be any fuck-ups.
This is going to work!
I'd like to hear a tune about...
...I guess about those discussions
I was talking about that...
...small circles of friends around living rooms...
...around pipes, when they weren't selling any papers on the street...
...and we weren't walking around this beautiful green place smoking, and...
...not being afraid.
There's a cat, and I really don't even know his name...
...but I remember that Chip said that...
...his old lady just had a baby and that made me think.
Wow, it really is a city here!
But this is, this is for you and your old lady, man! Whew!
That kid is going to be far out!
"Why must every generation think their folks are square?"
"And no matter where their heads are, they know Moms ain't there."
"Because I swore when I was small, that I'd remember when..."
"...I knew what's wrong with them, that I was smaller, then."
"I determined to remember all the cardinal rules..."
"...like sun-showers are legal grounds for skipping school."
"I know I have forgotten maybe one or two..."
"...but I hope that I recall them all before the baby is due."
"And I know he'll have a question or two..."
"...like, 'Hey, Pop, can
I go ride my zoom..."
"...that goes two hundred miles an hour..."
"...suspended on balloons?"'
"'And I can put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue..."
"...and imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs?"'
"And I must be permissive..."
"...understanding the younger generation..."
"...and then I'll know that all I've learned..."
"...and then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid..."
"...then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid assumes..."
"...and all my deepest worries must be his cartoons..."
"...and still I'll try to tell him all the things I've done..."
"...relating to what he can do when he becomes a man..."
"...and still he'll stick his fingers in the fan..."
"...and, 'Hey, Pop, my girl friend is only three..."
"...she's got her own bitty phone and she's taking LSD..."
"...and now that we're best friends, she wants to give a taste to me."'
"'But what's the matter, Daddy?
How come you look so mean?"'
"'Could it be that you can't live up to your dreams?"'
No, it's not true, because we're doing it! I love you. Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, John Sebastian!
Give me an "F"!
Give me a "U"!
Give me a "C"!
Give me a "K"!
What does that spell?
Fuck!
Sing it!
More! More!
Country Joe!
Sir? You live here?
I sure as hell do!
Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
I'm right here to answer them.
Have you been affected by this festival at all? In any way?
What? We lost all of our milk.
We're just trying to put together a film, to show what the whole picture was like.
You know, from all sides.
How do you feel about it?
Do you want me to explain in plain English?
A shitty mess!
Tell me, in what way?
No bathrooms.
Our hundred fifty acres.
Gone, that's all.
And we didn't rent to them.
They all trespassed, every one!
Clarence, first tell me where you want this to go.
Can I ask you a question?
Is it okay if we use your telephone?
Oh, we have none. It's out.
This is a disaster area.
We don't even have a phone.
It's been out since yesterday morning.
Water?
Water I can give you.
And I'm sorry the phone has been out, I had an emergency call.
It's a disgraceful mess, if you want to know the answer!
What, specifically, has happened to you?
My fields are all cut up.
Our second cutting of hay is going.
Our cows, the milk truck didn't get here.
The milk had to be thrown out.
May I ask you how much money you made on this, uh, four days?
I have no, no conception.
Did you make five thousand dollars? have no idea.
It's too private a question?
It's, it's not only too private,
I didn't even have a chance...
...to total up the amount of purchases we made...
...the amount of money we took in.
We just, uh, haphazardly sent it to our home...
...and had it locked up until we had a chance to sit down and count it...
...which would probably be in about, uh, two to three days.
Would you like to see it again next...?
I'd love to see it again!
You'd love to see it, though?
I can't say the farmers would.
Well, it, it's, it's a matter of opinion.
What are your feelings about the garbage?
Where there are people, there is garbage.
You, you can't stop, stop progress.
Saturday night we got word over WVOS that...
...a lot of kids in town didn't have anything to eat.
Word went out that everybody should contribute food.
We went over to the park...
...the village permitted them to camp there.
A police car went up the street here with a loud speaker...
...and told the kids to come up there.
And we fed them Saturday night and all day Sunday.
Excess stuff was taken over to the school and they flew it to the, to the site.
How do you feel about them now?
Very good. I have a nineteen-year-old myself.
He's out on the Coast, and I felt that we've got to give them a fair shake here.
If kids are hungry, you've got to feed them. I don't know...
...maybe we ought to put, we ought to put everybody on pot.
And those kids were all happy.
They were all on pot.
Well, whatever it is...
It never should have happened.
If pot makes them happy and no trouble...
...maybe we ought to put all the adults on pot!
You want a fifteen-year-old girl sleeping in the field in a tent?
What are you, out of your mind?
It never should have happened!
Do you feel bad about the kids who were killed in Vietnam?
This has nothing to do with...
It's the same thing. The same thing.
There's no comparison.
People get more excited about the kids in Monticello than they do about...
Fifteen-year-old kids sleeping in the field?
They wanted to.
They're all high on pot!
Look, maybe if pot made them peaceful, maybe we all should take pot!
I was giving them water all along the road here, right up on the bridge...
...and they were not on pot!
Very lovely children, believe me.
They were selling stuff.
There was plenty of stuff there.
There's no doubt about it.
They had hundreds of kids in that house.
If you have four hundred and fifty thousand kids...
...and you've got two or three hundred...
...they were selling these, these blue acid tablets...
...which are bad, and they were selling them.
True, but figure the law of averages.
If you took 500 adults and brought them together and had plenty of booze...
...you know what would have happened?
You didn't see any drunks.
That's right. There was no fighting.
There was nobody stealing.
We had to feed them! What the hell else was there to do?
There was nothing else to do!
Having a good time?
Very nice.
The water is nice.
We were all sitting on a tree stump over there.
And the more people got on it, the lower it got.
About a year ago, I wouldn't have believed this was the way to swim...
...but this is the way to swim!
It's the way to go all the time, actually.
Think that's going to happen?
It's got to happen!
You go walking down the street where all the cars were coming in...
...and it's just the first day, and it was just beautiful!
Everybody is free.
Everybody is talking.
Everybody is really nude.
I don't think, uh, people come here to get uptight.
They come here to dig what's going on.
And even if they don't get into a festival, it's just a groove...
...being with all the people.
You know, you realize all over the country, they're coming together.
You realize that you're not the only people in your city...
...who are doing the things you are, but they're everywhere.
We're taking over!
I think the body is beautiful.
I think skinny dipping is just beautiful if, if you want to do it, if you can do it.
Some people can't, because all their...
...their environment made them, you know, feel that it's wrong.
Even though they know in their subconscious that it's right...
...it's kind of normal and natural, but we've been made to feel that it's wrong.
Row, row, row!
"Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream..."
"...merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream."
No, I haven't done this too often before.
Get it pointed in the right direction!
Well, did I miss any big spots?
Your cheekbone.
Here?
Why don't you tell me something really interesting?
I can't, really, standing there with the microphone.
Don't worry about it. Don't let it intimidate you. It's just a microphone.
I know, but it's very intimidating.
Just tell me anything, like anybody you'd like to meet.
Oh, wow! I don't know.
What did you think about the kids?
From what I've heard from outside sources for many years...
...I was very, very much surprised.
And I'm very happy to say...
...we think the people of this country should be proud of these kids.
Notwithstanding the way they dress or the way they wear their hair.
That's their own personal business.
But their, their inner workings, their inner selves...
...their, their self-demeanor cannot be questioned.
They can't be questioned as good American citizens.
That's kind of surprising coming from a cop.
I'm not a cop. I'm a Chief of Police.
We've got one more tune for you.
It's called "Soul Sacrifice."
Ladies and gentlemen, Santana!
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."
"...take you higher."
"Baby, baby, baby, light my fire!"
"I'll take you higher."
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."
"...take you higher..."
"...take you higher..."
"...take you higher!"
"I wanta, I wanta take you higher!"
"I wanta, I wanta, wanta take you higher!"
What we would like to do is sing a song together.
Now, you see, what usually happens...
...you get a group of people that might sing...
...and for some reasons that are not unknown anymore, they won't do it.
Most of us need approval.
Most of us need to get approval from our neighbors...
...before we can actually let it all hang down, you dig?
But what is happening here...
...is a sing-along. Now, a lot of people don't like to do it...
...because they feel it might be old-fashioned.
But you must dig that it is not a fashion in the first place.
It is a feeling...
...and if it was good in the past, it's still good.
We would like to sing a song called "Higher"...
...and if we could get everybody to join in, we'd appreciate it.
"Wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
What I want you to do, is say "higher" and throw the peace sign up.
It will do you no harm.
Still again, some people feel that they shouldn't...
...because there are situations where you need approval...
...to get in on something that could be so good.
"I wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
Now, if you'll throw the peace sign up and say "higher", get everybody to do it.
There's a whole lot of people here and a whole lot of people...
...might not want to do it...
...because they can somehow get around it...
...they feel there are enough people to make up for it...
...and on and on, et cetera.
We're going to try higher again, and if we get everybody to join in...
...we'd appreciate it.
It will do you no harm.
"Yeah, I wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
"Way upon a hill, I'll take you higher!"
"Yeah, I'll take you higher!"
"Going to take you higher!"
"Higher!"
How are you out there?
You're staying stoned and you've got enough water...
...and you've got a place to sleep, and everything?
Good morning.
What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand.
Now, it's not going to be steak and eggs, or anything...
...but it's going to be good food and we're going to get it to you.
It's not just the Hog Farm, either.
It's like the Ohio Mountain family and the Pranksters...
...and everybody else that volunteered...
...putting in their time into the free kitchens. In fact, it's everybody.
We're all feeding each other.
We must be in heaven, man!
There's always a little bit of heaven in a disaster area.
So, if you want to make it back to your campsites, we'll try and get the food to you.
Or if you stay here, we'll try and get the food to you.
Now, there's a guy up there, some hamburger guy...
...had his stand burned down last night.
But he's still got a little stuff left...
...and for you people that still believe that capitalism isn't that weird...
...you might help him out and buy a couple of hamburgers.
Okay, here it comes! Mess call!
Good morning.
Left side of the audience, stage right here...
...that wants to be fed...
...has got to slowly move it through the forest...
...to the Hog Farm where we've got about seventeen lines going, uh, to serve with.
If you start your lines going through the forest, you'll wind up...
...going into a line that will take you right to where all the food is being served.
Helen Hayman, to the front.
Jim MacLean, please go to the pink and white tent hospital as soon as possible.
And kissing builds up your mouth.
Richard Moss and Barbara, meet us at the information booth.
Cort Ritcher or Greg Hollander, go to the Ferris wheel at twelve o'clock.
Greg's sister has his medicine.
Okay, Gayle, wow!
S, i, r, i, n, c, i, o, n, e...
...meet your daddy-o at the first aid station, near the security office.
If you've got food, feed other people.
Bugsy, to the pink and white tent.
Keep feeding each other.
And if you're too tired to chew, pass it on.
We have a gentleman with us.
It's the gentleman upon whose farm we are. Mr. Max Yasgur!
Is this on?
I'm a farmer. I don't know...
I don't know how to speak to...
...twenty people at one time, let alone a crowd like this!
But I think you people have proven something to the world.
Not only to the town of Bethel, or
Sullivan County, or New York State...
...you've proven something to the world.
This is the largest group of people ever assembled in one place.
We have had no idea that there would be this size group...
...and because of that you had quite...
...a few inconveniences as far as water and food and so forth.
Your producers have done a mammoth job to see that you're taken care of.
They would enjoy a vote of thanks.
But above that, the important thing that you've proven to the world...
...is that a half a million kids...
...and I call you kids, because I have children that are older than you are...
...a half a million young people can get together...
...and have 3 days of fun and music and have nothing but fun and music.
And I, God bless you for it!
I see we meet again.
"Purple haze was in my brain."
"Lately things don't seem the same."
"I'm acting funny, but I don't know why."
"Excuse me while I kiss the sky."
"Purple haze all around."
"Don't know if I'm coming up or down."
"Am I happy or in misery?"
"Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me."
"Help me, baby. Help me, baby!"
The oldest and driest desert in the world.
Fifty thousand square miles of eternally shifting sand.
You'd think nobody could make a living here.
And yet, when the wind dies down and the dust settles...
...you see a tiny track, and many more.
No matter how harsh and inhospitable a place is...
...there's always someone who's willing to live there.
A whole community of little creatures have had millions of years...
...to adapt to the impossible conditions in this desert.
This one must have had three legs.
This one only one.
The beetles who live here have an air-cooled cooling system...
...like a Volkswagen, so they have to run like crazy to keep their cool.
Even courting has to be done on the run.
A quick kiss at full gallop, and the romance is over.
When you can't run any longer...
...you have to dig like mad to get out of the heat.
He goes in upside down.
He doesn't dig, he just walks right in.
And this one pulls the blanket over his head.
And the gecko dives in as if the sand is water.
This beautiful person has a different cooling system, more like a limousine.
She doesn't have to dash around like those Volkswagen types.
She can take life more slowly.
She even has a windshield wiper.
She cleans her eyes with her tongue.
And digging is done at leisure.
First the right hand, then the right foot at half speed.
Then the left hand, left foot...
...right hand, right foot.
The sidewinder's favorite meal is the diving gecko.
But geckos play hard-to-get.
So the sidewinder resorts to a very sneaky trick to catch his prey.
First, he buries himself in the sand until he is quite invisible.
Then his tail comes up and pretends to be a blade of grass.
Now, geckos don't eat grass, but ants do.
And geckos eat ants.
At this point, things happen rather quickly.
Ant goes for tail, gecko goes for ant...
End of gecko.
So some die and some live in the heart of the unearthly Red Namib Desert...
...in southwest Africa on the tropic of Capricorn.
And on the fringes of the Red Namib...
...lives the real miracle of the desert, the oryx.
The most beautiful of all antelope.
These amazing animals always manage to look sleek and well-fed...
...in this arid region where there seems to be no food and no water.
The austere beauty of the Namib remains undisturbed...
...because man finds the region so intimidating, he hardly ever intrudes.
But to the oryx and the little creatures of the Namib...
...this waterless, hostile desert is paradise.
Where the red desert ends, there's a vast white desert...
...where it's so quiet, you can hear the silence.
The White Namib, a region of rugged moonscapes and endless vistas.
Here the eye can feast on breathtaking beauty...
...but for the mouth, there seems to be nothing.
Still, oryx roam its boundless plains...
...and on the barren slopes of a desert mountain...
...you'll find a whole tribe of baboons...
...who are quite content to live in these grim surroundings.
Of course, those rocks do get rather hard after a while.
Home comforts are few, but they don't seem to mind...
...the lack of modern conveniences.
Their social system works very much like human society.
At the very top, there's the big chief whose word is law.
And at the very bottom, there's the little guy...
...who likes to mind his own business.
Now you know who's important around here.
Actually, they're a happy gang.
And when it cools down towards evening, they get playful.
And then the acrobatic types start showing off.
Some don't do it very well, but they're willing to work at it.
Trees are very scarce in the White Namib...
...so the little weaverbirds have learned to share and cooperate.
They build large condominiums where dozens of families can live...
...each in its own apartment.
And they go in for quite a variety of architectural styles:
Squat ranch type, complex...
...modern, artistic...
...high-rise, and even symbolic.
Some nests are more than 100 years old, and the little tenants...
...are continually building on, remodeling and repairing.
A cozy little community where you can raise a contented family.
But sometimes tragedy strikes.
Once in a long while, a dewdrop will hang in just the right spot...
...at the right time, to focus the sun's rays on the dry, combustible thatch.
In a few minutes, the flames destroy a hundred years' work...
...and bring grief to many families.
The vast White Namib is only a narrow band...
...on the map of the immense
African continent...
...but it's gradually encroaching deeper and deeper inland...
...creating a region of scrubby growth and very little grass:
The Pre-Namib, where the dainty springbok roam.
This used to be lush grassland, but for the past 10,000 years...
...the Pre-Namib has been slowly drying out, and the animals and plants that live here...
...have to adapt to a climate where the rainfall...
...gets less and less as the years pass.
Some plants have adapted magnificently to the challenge of the changing climate.
Stapelia flowers, for instance...
...had to evolve a way of getting pollinated...
...in a region where there are no bees.
So instead of emitting a pretty smell to entice bees...
...they put out a powerful stench like a rotting carcass...
...and this attracts the blue fly, who likes smelly meat.
As he scurries about looking for that lovely, stinking food he can smell...
...he does a good job of pollinating the flower.
When he finally realizes he's been tricked, he flies off in disgust.
But he has done something useful for once.
In a few short weeks after the rain...
...this plant grows quickly to maturity, bears seeds, and dies.
But even after death, it protects its seeds...
...in those strange-looking pods for a year or more...
...until the rain comes again.
Then the moisture causes those dead parts...
...to move like bizarre living creatures, and they open up.
And then the moisture triggers little springs inside the pods.
The seeds are shot out in a hurry...
...to germinate and grow while the soil is still wet...
...so they can bear more seeds to start the next generation.
An incredible variety of animals...
...have accepted the challenge of living in the Pre-Namib...
...where you are never sure whether it'll rain this year or next year.
The scaly anteater, who looks like a tired medieval knight in armor.
The wart hog, who's so ugly, he's beautiful...
...and who always goes into his home tail-first.
Porcupines, who should know better than anyone...
...not to go through the same door at the same time.
The scorpion, who carries her babies on her back.
The chameleon, whose eyes move independently...
...so he can see where he's going and where he's been.
He must be the only creature in the world...
...whose left eye doesn't know what his right eye is doing.
The dikkop, who spends 95%% of his life looking like a stuffed bird...
...because he stands so very still and never blinks.
When he does move, it's only for a split second...
...and then he freezes again.
And then there are wildebeests...
...and ostrich and starlings...
...and zebra and giraffe.
There's a whole treasure house of animal life...
...in the wide and thirsty Pre-Namib.
It's also lion country, and at the water holes...
...the animals are nervous and skittish.
Even the appearance of a cub causes sudden panic.
Which, of course, makes Junior feel mighty superior.
Some days, the animals will drink quite calmly...
...in the presence of a whole pride.
They seem to sense that the lions have eaten well...
...and will not be hunting today.
In fact, the king's belly is so full, it gets up long after he does.
So who's afraid of a slob like that?
But if one of the younger generation gets cheeky...
...that slob suddenly walks like a king again.
His Majesty knows how to cope with the generation gap...
...and he will make an example of the young upstart...
...who has dared to challenge the establishment.
A long, long stare until the young one is thoroughly cowed.
And now the young rebel has to lie down again...
...so that the king can come walking past once more.
And this time he knows he'll be shown the respect due to him.
He's not even a very imposing specimen, as lions go...
...but he does remember that he's descended from a long line of kings.
The hyena could have been king of the desert.
His jaws are stronger than those of a lion, and he has those powerful forequarters...
...but nature saw fit to give him a weak and wobbly rear end...
...and a slow, ungainly gait.
So instead of being king of the desert, he's a lowly trash collector...
...who lives off the leftovers of the lion and other hunters.
It's just as well he's not the king, because he's a real stinker.
He's a coward. He's sneaky.
He often slobbers and drools.
He loves to roll in the rotting remains...
...of some dead animal to mask his own smell.
He has a silly giggle.
And, worst of all, he's not content to live on garbage alone...
...so he'll eat the babies of other animals when he can get to them.
The faster ones get away because he's too lazy to exert himself...
...but the smaller and slower ones are in constant danger.
Yellow-billed ducklings are fortunate...
...because their mother is a very clever actress.
She also has great courage.
When she sees a hyena prowling about, she tells the kids to be quiet...
...and walks towards the hyena...
...while they start sneaking away towards the water.
Now she gives a quack to get the hyena's attention...
...and goes into her wounded-bird act.
She really hams it up...
...because she's got to keep him from spotting the chicks.
So she flounders about pitifully to convince him he can catch her easily.
But when he gets too close, she recovers miraculously...
...and streaks for the water.
For a moment, he begins to doubt the sincerity of her performance...
...but she quickly goes into her next act, the pathetic drowning duck...
...with all the cries for help and all the "glub-glubs" the scene calls for.
So he believes her again and follows her at his leisure...
...because he's sure she's easy meat.
And behind his back, the chicks slip quietly into the water.
This is a crucial moment, because they have to swim across open water...
...to get to a safe hiding place...
...so she dare not let his attention wander away from her.
And she has to let him come dangerously close...
...to keep him convinced he can catch her.
When at last the chicks reach the hiding place...
...she can consider her own safety and make another miraculous recovery.
And he begins to wonder whether he's been taken for a sucker.
Somehow the scavengers and the carrion-eaters...
...are the unbeautiful people of the desert...
...not only in looks, but also in character.
The stuffy-looking marabous...
...are members of the elegant and aristocratic stork family...
...but thousands of years ago, they started making their living by disposing...
...of the remains of dead animals...
...and they began to look more and more like unsuccessful undertakers.
Nowadays, the marabou wears a threadbare black coat...
...and a holier-than-thou expression on his unlovely face.
They seem to look down their noses at everyone else...
...and always seem to be discussing...
...the follies and the sinfulness of the other animals.
The female ostrich is a dull gray, but the male is a handsome devil.
At mating time, the handsome boys flash their plumage to impress the girls.
And the less good-looking ones have to fight for their lady loves.
Finally, a loving couple will find a secluded spot...
...to do their beautiful mating dance.
Pretty soon, they start a family.
Actually, he's a better parent than she is.
And on a hot afternoon, she will join the rest of the gang at the water hole...
...leaving him to keep an eye on the nest.
This is a full-time job, because each egg is a whole meal...
...and there are many freeloaders in the Namib.
Meanwhile, back at the nest...
...young Oscar chooses this moment to get born.
There's no one to welcome him because Mother is out swimming...
...and Father is out fighting Hottentots.
Oscar feels very lonely, so he wobbles off to find company.
He is now only two minutes old, but already he knows about camouflage.
On the morning of his wedding day...
...the wart hog goes down to the water hole for a bath...
...because he wants to look nice for his bride-to-be.
That's enough.
Meanwhile, the young lady of his choice moves into his bachelor apartment...
...and immediately starts changing things.
He does a thorough job of grooming himself today...
...and she wants her future home to be just right.
And when he comes home, he begins to realize...
...that you have to make some adjustments to your lifestyle when you get married.
And there you have as handsome a couple of young newlyweds as you can hope to find.
The friendliest and the most affectionate little creatures...
...in the desert are the meerkats.
Sorry, fella.
They're also most inquisitive, and when a stranger intrudes...
...he's received with courtesy and friendly curiosity.
Even a poisonous cobra is inspected and invited to be friendly.
An egg is pure frustration.
He knows there's something good in there, but how do you get to it?
The mongoose looks like the meerkat, but he's from a different family.
When he finds an egg, he hikes it to the nearest rock...
...juggles it into position, takes a quick sighting, and shoots.
But the meerkat doesn't have the know-how.
He always digs for his food...
...so instinctively, he tries to solve this problem by digging.
But it doesn't work.
Maybe he can learn by watching the mongoose.
All right, he'll try that.
That guy makes it look so easy.
But the egg-eater snake...
...can swallow an egg
10 times as big as his head...
...without breaking it or his head.
He unhooks his lower jaw from the rest of his face...
...so he can open his mouth wide enough.
At first, the egg keeps slipping away, and he goes around in circles.
But he has a good reason for that.
Eventually, he has the egg surrounded so it can't slip away anymore.
And now he can do his trick.
Once the egg is safely inside him, he crushes it...
...and squeezes out all the good stuff without spilling a drop.
And a few minutes later, he ejects the shell in a neat, disposable package.
But if you want to swallow eggs whole, there's no room for teeth in your mouth.
That makes him the most defenseless snake in the world...
...so apparently, Mother Nature has played a nasty trick on him.
But to make up for it, she painted phony teeth on his lips...
...and she taught him to put up such an act of ferocity...
...that he can even intimidate an elephant.
That intricate winding movement makes him look twice his size...
...and lets his scales make an angry rasping sound as they rub together.
He pretends to strike viciously, but he has to make sure he misses...
...otherwise his enemy will find out that he has no teeth.
But his act is so good that no one ever calls his bluff...
...and everyone believes he's very dangerous.
A baboon will eat every creepy-crawly thing he can find under rocks...
...but if he should come across an egg-eater snake...
...he'll fall down in a dead faint.
And would you believe it, he looks under the same rock and faints again.
Sometimes he's sorry he got married, because she's always cleaning house.
He wants a girlfriend, and that's his way of advertising.
He knows if there's a lady tapping beetle within half a mile...
...she'll hear him and answer back.
So all day and all night, he taps and listens, taps and listens...
...because tapping beetles are scarce here...
...and he has a long and lonely quest ahead of him.
The backfiring beetle doesn't use his rear end for tapping. He uses it to defend himself.
His ammunition is a stinging acid, and he always hits his enemy right in the eye.
These are some of the animals who are at home in the Pre-Namib.
They've accepted the hardships of the changing planet and seem to enjoy...
...living in this arid land where the rain sometimes stays away for years.
In the southern part of the Pre-Namib, billions of seeds...
...lie waiting for years in the dust of the desert floor.
When the rain comes at last, a miraculous transformation happens.
The desert covers itself in a wall-to-wall carpet, and an incredible variety...
...of flowers celebrate the coming of the life-giving moisture.
For a few weeks, the Pre-Namib tries to recapture the glories of the past...
...when this was a paradise.
But the glory is short-lived.
The sun dehydrates the earth again, and the flowers return to dust.
But they leave billions of seeds in the desert soil...
...because the rain may come again, and they'll have another festival.
For now, the desert reverts to bleakness...
...and those few weeks of color seem as if they never happened.
There is one spot in the Pre-Namib that is a year-round paradise...
...because the Cubango River streams out of the Tropics.
Unlike other rivers, it never reaches the sea.
It blunders into the vastness of the desert and is swallowed.
But before those millions of gallons of water disappear under the sand...
...they create a luxuriant subtropical jungle in the middle of the desert.
A year-round Garden of Eden, complete with serpent and other predators.
The kingfisher pinpoints his target precisely...
...and gets into the exact position by moving this way and that.
Then he strikes.
Like a fighter pilot, he dives with the sun behind him so his prey can't see him coming.
At high noon, he goes straight down.
And later, when the sun is lower, he comes in at an angle.
Far below the lily pads, there's another paradise where life is mostly placid...
...with some hectic moments.
The bream has as many as a thousand babies at one time...
...and she has a very cute trick to protect them from predators.
Father keeps a lookout so he can warn Mother when danger comes.
Old snaggletooth comes prowling out of his lair, and Father nearly throws a fit.
He gives the alarm, so the kids beeline for Mother, who promptly swallows them...
...the whole thousand.
Whoops, little Wilbur is late.
Snaggletooth attacks once more.
"Hey, Mom, let me in, let me in!"
"Shucks!"
The villain gives up and leaves, so Dad gives the all clear, and Mother spits them out.
Most of the kids are happy to be free...
...but there are always some insecure sissies who want to go back inside where it's safe...
...and she cannot get rid of them.
"Go and play outside."
In the jungles and on the flood plains...
...on the banks of the Cubango...
...nobody needs to work, because there's plenty of water and food for everybody.
There's no day-to-day struggle for existence, and the animals enjoy a life...
...of peace and plenty.
One may wonder why animals in the surrounding desert don't flock...
...to share in this life of luxury.
Here, the trees and plants bear fruits and seeds and berries to suit every taste.
The seeds of the tambuti tree jump and cavort...
...because inside each one there's a little worm with the hiccups.
In paradise, even the worms are cute.
And in every tree, there's a whole parade of characters from every walk of life.
A lady with her hair in curlers.
A cross between a zebra and a vacuum cleaner.
A little dachshund, complete with waggly tail.
A dizzy blond with a painted face.
And other beautiful people.
A portly old gentleman in conservative gray.
The hobo.
The poor guy on skid row.
Longhaired hippie.
And the real far-out weirdo who does his own wild thing.
And, of course, the bloated, overfed, overdressed slob.
He illustrates what's wrong with living in paradise...
...because many members of this society have become blasé and bored with life.
Things are just too easy in the Cubango Basin.
They no longer have a zest for living like their cousins out in the inhospitable desert.
Here, life offers no challenge, and many of them have become slobs and easy riders.
The only excitement in their lives comes in high summer...
...when the marula trees are in full fruit.
At first, the marulas are very tasty and hard to get at.
You have to be either agile or strong to get your share.
After a few weeks, the marulas get overripe, and they start dropping from the trees.
Then all the animals wade in and gorge themselves on the rotting fruit.
It starts fermenting in their tummies and turns into a very potent brew.
On the way home, things start happening to them.
When night falls, there's peace again.
A very blissful peace.
Not everybody in the Cubango leads a wasteful life.
Some members of this too-prosperous society are still sober, hardworking folk.
The weavers here don't build condos like those in the White Namib.
Each one builds his own free-swinging nest.
To do that, he has to perform a small miracle.
He has no hands, only his little beak to make all those intricate knots.
So a newlywed is nervous when he builds his first nest under the watch of his bride.
When the job is done, he hops onto a twig and timidly invites his wife to inspect it.
She flits across and takes a long, hard look at her future home.
It doesn't look very neat, and she doesn't even like the neighborhood.
She's got to raise her kids in this?
"You like it, huh? You like it? Huh?"
She makes a closer inspection and subjects the house to testing...
...to see whether it conforms to her specifications, and he's in quite a flutter.
She's not satisfied and vents her fury on his substandard workmanship.
"You didn't like it, huh?"
"You bet your life I didn't like it."
He will try again, and this time he chooses the neighborhood carefully.
He's all of a twitter because she's watching.
First he has to tie two twigs together, but it's not easy. Those twigs are springy.
Oh, boy, it's not easy.
But if all those others can do it, he can too.
One day, he'll build a house he can be proud of...
...although he'll still get nervous when his wife comes to approve it.
The hornbill installs his wife inside a tree trunk and seals her up for three months.
But first he cleans out her cell to make sure she'll be comfortable in there.
Then he flies off to get some clay to wall her in, and she starts undressing.
She plucks out her coarser feathers so she can be soft for the chicks when they hatch.
Without those feathers, she can't fly, but she won't be using her wings for a while.
He comes back with a beakful of clay and blocks the entrance...
...so she and her chicks will be safe.
He leaves only a slit, the size and shape for a hornbill's bill...
...so he can bring her food and water while she lays and hatches her eggs.
And then there are suddenly five mouths to feed, and Father has to provide for them all.
Throughout the summer, he's the hardest-working member...
...of the opulent Cubango community.
When the chicks grow bigger he has to provide a balanced diet.
One day, green stuff with lots of vitamins.
The next day, proteins.
One lucky day, a swarm of proteins comes buzzing around the nest...
...saving Dad a lot of labor.
He's quite sorry when they leave.
Oh, well, back to the grind.
The chicks have been taught not to pollute their own nest, and their aim is remarkable.
As they grow, it gets crowded in the nursery.
So one fine day, Mother breaks open the roof, and out they come.
Father feels happy and proud to see his children at last...
...but perhaps he also feels sad and discarded.
Now they don't need him anymore.
Although wart hogs get as smashed...
...as everybody else during the marula binge...
...they lead exemplary lives for the rest of the year.
Family ties are strong, and the little ones are attached to their mother.
Of course, in every family there is always one unlucky one.
If there are any knocks coming, he gets them.
The cheetah is the fastest runner in the world...
...and if Mrs. Wart Hog is not alert, she can lose some of her family.
But she's quick to sense danger, and hogs are pretty fast on their feet too.
Each one finds a hole and pops in tail-first.
The unlucky one chooses a hole that's too small, and now he can get neither in nor out.
Luckless is trapped very far from home.
They say hogs can't count, but Mother knows that one of her children is missing.
At last, the frustrated cheetah goes away.
Mother searches every hole and behind every bush for her child.
She cannot rest before she finds him.
Luckless guesses it's safe to come out...
...and it dawns on him that he doesn't know the way home.
All night long, Mother keeps a vigil for her little lost one.
He's never slept alone, and in the middle of the night...
...some big animals come sniffing around.
He tries to lie very still and pretend he's only a stone...
...but he's very frightened.
When a baby wart hog gets separated from its mother, it'll try to find a substitute.
It's not easy to get yourself adopted...
...when you have a face that only your mother can love.
The only one who will adopt him is an old rotting log.
He's a very sad little boy.
When a honey badger is young, his parents abandon him...
...and he has to find his own food.
He's not an expert hunter yet.
He'll have to live on worms and grubs in this land of milk and honey...
...unless some fairy godmother comes to his aid.
Incredibly, nature provides just such a godmother in the shape of a little bird.
For a while, she looks on as he scratches and digs...
...for the few scraps of food he can find.
When the time is ripe, she introduces herself.
At first, he resents this noisy, fluttering nuisance, but eventually...
...some deep instinct makes him realize dimly that he has to follow her.
So she finally leads him to the objective:
A big, fat beehive.
All his instincts come to the surface.
He knows his favorite food is in there, and nothing will stop him.
His hide is impervious to bee stings. The only vulnerable spot is the tip of his nose.
At last, the payoff.
This amazing partnership of the honey guide bird and the badger...
...is an intriguing example of teamwork between different species.
He doesn't eat all the loot, because she's entitled to her share.
The inhabitants of the Cubango Basin...
...don't realize how lucky they are to be living in luxury.
To them, this land of plenty is the whole universe.
They're unaware that their bounteous habitat...
...is a small green world floating...
...in the vast emptiness of the Pre-Namib.
The Pre-Namib, again, is dwarfed by its neighbor on Capricorn, the Kalahari.
This is the most treacherous desert of all, because after the short rainy season...
...it looks like an immense paradise that can rival the opulence of the Cubango.
The grass is as high as an elephant's eye, and while the surface water lasts...
...everybody prospers.
At the water holes, there is so much traffic that all the grass is worn away.
Zebra in their thousands.
Graceful kudu, the males with beautiful horns...
...the females with beautiful ears.
Oryx, who, unlike their cousins in the Namib, revel in the abundant water.
Ostrich.
The fussy-looking secretary bird, who's very good at short takeoffs...
...but needs a heck of a long runway for landing.
The towering giraffe, who makes the zebra look like toys.
Some years there's even a vast shallow lake for a short while after the rain...
...where water birds converge in great numbers.
The lake covers 8000 square miles, but it's only a few inches to a few feet in depth.
And most years, a great flock of pelicans establish...
...their breeding colony in the middle of the lake.
They look stodgy and comical on the ground and pompous in the air.
But on water, they have style and elegance.
They gather in flotillas to herd fish into the shallows...
...where they dip in a graceful ballet to collect food for their chicks.
But the lake and the many water holes are impermanent.
Soon the water will sink away into the Kalahari sand...
...and there'll be a long, grim wait of nine months or more...
...before the rain comes again.
The only human beings...
...in the deep Kalahari are a few Bushmen.
They don't live in tribes, but roam about in small family groups.
The region is so vast that one family hardly ever meets another.
They must be the most carefree and contented people in the world...
...because they own nothing.
In the desert, there's nothing you can own, but everything you need.
They're also the most gentle people, possibly because they've never seen...
...anything as hard as a rock or a stone in their lives.
Where they live, there's only sand and trees and grass and animals.
So their tools are made of leather or bone or wood.
They never experience anything harder than wood.
When they find food, they eat it all at one sitting...
...so they have very expandable stomachs.
When they sleep, their heads never touch the ground...
...because there are crawly things in the sand that can get into their ears.
They dig their elbows into the soft sand and use their shoulders as pillows.
The children have to have an intimate understanding of the animals around them.
So the elders teach them, in stereophonic sound yet.
But somehow the children manage to listen to two teachers at once.
They are superb mimics, and they feel a close affinity...
...with the animals who are their neighbors and also their food.
The Bushman is a very small man, and his weapons are puny.
He has to sneak up very close to his food...
...because his arrow can only kill at 30 paces.
The biggest nuisance in his life is the go-away bird...
...who seems to take pleasure in sabotaging him.
It'll watch him stalking painstakingly up to his quarry...
...and then tell it to go away.
Such beautiful targets.
When the water holes begin to grow smaller, the animals get restless.
Soon they'll have to move away, leaving all that beautiful grass uneaten.
They're loath to leave this bountiful food supply...
...and they'll hang on until the last of the water disappears.
Fights break out easily, and when two oryx bulls lose their tempers...
...the outcome can be fatal, so the leader of the herd will try to make peace.
Those horns are like rapiers, and the oryx use them like expert swordsmen.
The peacemaker's efforts are not very successful.
He only succeeds in goading them further.
With a sudden jab, one gets his horn into position for the fatal thrust.
If he can drive that horn in a few more inches, he'll go right to the heart.
When things get too hot, the loser breaks and runs.
He'll live to fight another day.
The smaller water holes dry up first...
...but sometimes there's plenty of water below the sand.
You just have to know where to dig.
But elephants are finicky, and this water stinks.
The royal family has its own water supply, and when it runs low...
...a young female always gets the job of keeping all the other animals away.
She has to work out there on the hot plain while the rest of the family...
...take it easy in the shade.
She grew fat and lazy during the affluent season...
...and finds it a very tedious assignment.
One pesky impala in particular makes her life a misery.
The strange thing is that the impala doesn't really need the water.
He can get enough moisture by licking the dew off the grass...
...in the early morning.
Maybe he gets up too late, or maybe he just likes to pester her for the hell of it.
Of course, lion is king only until elephants make the scene...
...even if they're only youngsters.
The Bushman is not dependent on water holes.
His forebears have had thousands of years to adapt to the Kalahari...
...so he needs very little liquid, and he knows where to find it.
An insignificant-looking dry twig tells him where to dig.
Anyone else would die of thirst in a few days...
...in this treacherous desert that doesn't look like a desert...
...but he can survive for months on end.
He unearths a bulbous root...
...which is really just a solid lump of wood with hard fibers that are merely damp.
Civilized man would need some pretty complicated technology...
...and machinery to get water out of it, but he uses the very simplest of tools.
His scraper is a stick that has been split to give it a sharp edge...
...and he produces some dry-looking shavings.
But you take a handful, point your thumb at your mouth...
...squeeze very hard and wait for it.
The baboons always have a secret supply of water...
...and they're not going to tell anybody where it is.
And when a Machalahari ventures into the deep Kalahari...
...on a hunting trip, he has to find water...
...because, unlike the Bushman, he doesn't know how to make liquid from a root.
But he has his own way of finding out where the water is.
First, he drills a hole in a giant ant heap when he's sure a baboon is watching him...
...because he knows baboons are incurably inquisitive.
Next, he puts some wild melon seeds into the hole...
...and works them in so that they drop into a hollow.
Then he saunters off, knowing the baboon is burning with curiosity.
The baboon doesn't trust that human being at all, so he plays it cool.
But he's dying to know what gives in that confounded hole.
Finally, Mr. Inquisitive can't take it any longer.
He's got to know what's in there.
He reaches in, grabs a fistful, and now his hand's too big to come out.
If he had the sense to drop the seeds, he could free his hand.
Now he lets go when it's too late.
So that was a smart enough way to catch a baboon...
...but he still has to make him talk.
Now, he knows that salt is very scarce in this particular area...
...and that baboon is going to eat those lumps like candy.
In fact, he has such a ball eating salt that he completely forgets he's under arrest...
...and that in a little while he's going to be a mighty thirsty baboon.
Next morning, the Machalahari goes to have a closer look...
...to see whether his prisoner is ready to talk.
He decides the brainwashing has worked, so he sets him free...
...knowing that in his condition he won't care who follows him...
...to the secret reservoir.
The Machalahari has no eyes for the beauty of the setting.
To him, water is beautiful.
Now the water holes have dried up to only a trickle...
...and soon that will be hard-baked soil.
In a few short weeks, paradise turns into purgatory.
The merciless sun scorches down, and dust devils dance...
...across the parching earth.
Most of the animals migrate to other regions...
...but some hardy and some foolhardy ones remain.
And the vultures know that their prosperous time is approaching.
By this time, the great lake has dried up completely...
...into a boundless, white expanse.
Mummified fish lie scattered on the dry, cracked surface.
Animals migrating across the lake from the Kalahari...
...plod through cruel mirages of water that doesn't splash under their feet...
...and they pass phantom trees that offer no shade.
After days of plodding, some begin to panic...
...when there seems to be no end to the vastness.
Some just give up and stop walking.
Some years, the drought comes too soon for the pelicans...
...who nested in the center of the lake.
The parents stand around helplessly as their little black chicks...
...suffer agonies of hunger and thirst and heat.
They're almost fully grown, but are still too young to fly...
...so they're trapped in this boundless desolation.
One little one begins to walk blindly away into the searing heat...
...and his parents can only look on in despair.
In the first weeks of his life, this was a bountiful lake.
He cannot understand how his beautiful world could change into this pitiless void.
So he walks and walks, hoping in despair to find his beautiful world again...
...somewhere in this vast emptiness.
In the evening, cool, moist air...
...comes drifting into the desert, bringing a promise of life-giving rain.
In the morning, the clouds are still streaming into the desert sky...
...but the sun burns mercilessly, and one by one...
...they shrivel in the searing heat.
A few stragglers survive, but as they penetrate deeper into the desert...
...they, too, dwindle and fade.
In the end, the parents have to abandon their chicks...
...and fly away to the sea.
And the chicks begin to walk.
They are very weak now, and the dried-out lake is endless.
It is a death march that leaves a trail of little bodies...
...for mile upon mile on the vastness...
...until only a pitiful few are left alive.
Far away from the desert, the clouds build up into towering masses...
...as they prepare to invade the stronghold of the sun once more.
Like a liberating army, wave after wave of cumulus...
...surges across the African plains.
Even before they reach the desert, the sun begins to pound down on the upper layers...
...and it tears great gaps in the ranks of the invaders.
But when the advance guard reaches the desert, it is still a formidable force.
It penetrates several miles into the desert...
...and some clouds even discharge their load of rain.
But the rain never reaches the ground because the relentless sun evaporates...
...the water before it can fall on the thirsting earth.
The invasion loses impetus under the fury of the sun...
...and the clouds are vanquished.
And the surviving chicks wait in vain for relief from their anguish.
By nightfall, only a few scattered remnants drift around aimlessly.
During the night, the clouds regroup their forces.
Great masses move around in the darkness like vast engines of war...
...as they maneuver into position for another invasion.
At dawn, they launch another massive attack.
Again, wave after wave sweeps towards the desert.
And in the turmoil of a titanic battle of the elements, the sun is finally obliterated.
Then there is a great hush.
Strangely, when deliverance comes at last, the animals show no signs of rejoicing.
They merely wait impassively for the rain to pass.
And after a few minutes, it stops.
Abruptly and suddenly.
The thirsty earth soaks up the long-awaited moisture.
But in the rocky parts, the water runs off and brings new perils.
The flash floods drain off as suddenly as they started.
And now the desert can settle down to enjoy the return of prosperity.
But still the animals show no sign of rejoicing.
It takes several days before it dawns on them that...
...paradise has returned to the desert.
Then their joy of living comes bursting out.
[lNDISTINCT CHATTER OVER SPEAKERS]
NARRATOR: Seven brave astronauts are about to launch... on the most challenging and risky mission ever flown in space.
[C HATTE Rl N G]
ALTMAN: It's an I nteresting emotion when you're sitting there... and real izi ng the clock is ticking.
- Al I the preparation ti me is over.
- Feel okay, si r?
It's time to go out there and do it.
Al I rig ht. Okay, good.
MASS I M I N O:
It's not a fool hardy risk.
It's not rol ler-skati ng down
Massach usetts Aven ue in rush hou r.
If there's some risk that goes along with ach ievi ng a d ream...
I th I nk it's worth it, and that's what I wou ld wan na tel I my kids.
Dreams do come true.
Okay.
McARTH U R:
It felt a lot I I ke Ch ristmas morn I ng.
You know, going to get to open your presents.
I got up, big smile on my face.
And marched down to have my breakfast and just really felt great.
Right now the thing
I'm looking forward to most... is the solid rocket booster ignition.
I wanna get started.
GOOD: I think it was my grandfather that had the most profound influence on me.
He'd bring out the binoculars and he'd teach us about the sky.
No idea that I would be traveling to the stars.
But here I am.
GRU NSFELD: I go through the mission in my mind, and ask, "Okay..." what could go wrong?" And I ask myself,
"Are we ready to handle that?"
NARRATOR: This is the last chance to save the Hubble Space Telescope.
Here we are, cocooned on our beautiful planet Earth... warmed by the light of our nearest star, the sun.
When you see our home like this, you think:
"Out there in all that black space..." could there be another place like it?
"Is there anybody else out there?"
The nearest of those stars is billions of miles away... but that hasn't stopped us from exploring them.
Galileo was the first.
Centuries later, we built a truly magical machine... the likes of which Galileo could never have imagined.
MAN: N ice and slow.
NARRATOR:
The Hubble Space Telescope.
It took more than 10 years and 10,000 people to build.
MAN: Keep coming.
And it would be the first of its kind to be launched into orbit around the Earth.
MAN:
Okay, stop. Okay, hold it steady.
[CROWD CH EERl NG]
NARRATOR: This astronaut crew was chosen to ferry the telescope to space.
Hello, hello, hello.
They launched from the Kennedy Space
Center aboard the shuttle Discovery.
MAN [OVER PA]:
T-minus 10, go for main engine start.
We are go for main engine start.
T-minus six, five, four... three, two, one.
And liftoff.
NARRATOR: With the sea and clouds of Earth reflecting on its door... the great silver bird was released to soar in orbit 320 miles above us.
Soon it would be sending images back to us.
Could we finally unlock the secrets of the universe?
Would we discover other worlds like ours?
The whole world waited for Hubble to open its enormous eye.
Engineers have discovered that the giant telescope has a warped mirror.
One of the mirrors in the Hubble Space
Telescope is out of shape, and as a result... the pictures it's sending back are no better than those from the ground.
WOMAN:
You've got a go to open the doors.
M USGRAVE: Okay, swinging.
NARRATOR: It would be three long years before astronauts could return... with a remedy for the ailing Hubble.
HOFFMAN: I'm not even pulling it,
I'm just coaxing it with my fingertips.
AKERS: Pitch, pitch up a little.
NARRATOR:
They installed two instruments... each containing a huge contact lens.
Scientists hoped the new lenses would sharpen the telescope's blurry vision.
MAN: Good work, guys.
NARRATOR: Above the splendor of
Africa's Cape of Good Hope...
Hubble was launched once again.
In the next 10 years, three more astronaut crews... would repair and enhance
Hubble's vision even further... transporting us to places we could only have dreamed about.
In a stream of staggering images...
Hubble revealed the powerful prolonged aurora on Saturn.
The haunting gaze of a dying star, the Helix Nebula.
The awesome Eagle Nebula, known as the pillars of creation... a birthplace of stars.
And the Mice... a pair of galaxies twisted and torn by their gravitational dance.
Hubble captured imagery so complex... we can actually travel through it.
This is real star travel.
The bright star passing by is Sirius.
It's one of the nearest to Earth, a mere 50 trillion miles away.
We're now heading towards the three little stars in a slanted row there... called Orion's Belt.
Distances here are so vast, they're measured in light-years.
A single light-year is almost six trillion miles.
Orion is 1500 light-years away.
That means we're traveling at 150 trillion miles a second.
We're going to explore that rose-colored cloud just below the belt.
It's called the Orion Nebula.
There are amazing things happening inside these clouds.
As we look through Hubble's eye... we're getting to see them as never before.
We're descending into a gargantuan canyon of clouds.
It's 90 trillion miles across.
It's a star nursery.
The biggest of the young stars are right in the center of the nursery.
Their energy creates unbelievably strong winds... howling down this vast canyon at five million miles an hour.
The winds have blasted out a huge bowl-shaped cavity... in the side of the cloud facing the Earth... giving Hubble and us... a window on the secret life of the stars inside.
The biggest star here is surrounded by a flock of baby stars... each nested in its own cocoon.
The wind from the giant star is blowing so hard against these little ones... it creates shock waves on their near sides, and long tails behind.
That's why astronomers have nicknamed these strange objects "tadpoles." lnside each cocoon is an infant solar system.
These tadpoles might turn into full-grown solar systems one day... but the continuous blast of wind may stunt their growth.
But tucked away in a calmer part of Orion's nursery...
Hubble has found confirmation... that planets are forming around other stars.
Our own solar system may have looked just like this... when the sun had formed, but the Earth did not yet exist.
Perhaps this is how we and our own world began.
The once-ailing
H ubble Space Telescope... offered its greatest performance yet... a glimpse of time and space astronomers had previously only dreamed about.
But for the H ubble, time is running out... amid new concerns about safety in space.
NARRATOR: In early 2003, the tragic loss of space shuttle Columbia... forced NASA to rethink its program.
MALE ANNOU NCER: NASA has canceled
Hubble's final service mission.
In Washington, Senator Barbara Mikulski led the charge to review the decision... questioning NASA Administrator
Sean O'Keefe's January claim... that keeping Hubble alive wasn't worth the cost or the risk.
Hubble is not a piece of techno-junk that's creaky, tattered and worn.
If we do nothing, then within about two years... either its gyroscopes or its batteries will die... and it'll tumble out of control.
NARRATOR: But flight designers came up with a daring plan to reduce the risk.
If the shuttle was damaged during launch... another one could come up and rescue the stranded crew.
They could shimmy from one to the other down the arm, fireman style.
We'll let them try it first.
We are going to add a shuttle servicing mission... to the Hubble Space Telescope, to the shuttle's manifest... to be flown before it retires.
[APPLAUSE]
NARRATOR:
The final mission is a go... and for the first time, a second orbiter stands ready... in case there's a call for help.
Just weeks to launch, the Hubble crew is training hard.
[I NDISTl NCT CHATTER]
The spacewalkers practice in this six million gallon pool... at the Johnson Space Center.
It's the closest they can get to zero gravity.
McARTH UR:
Motion is stopped for the stanchion.
GOOD: Okay.
NARRATOR:
Four stories underwater... there's an entire shuttle cargo bay and a life-size model of Hubble.
MASSl M I NO:
A big thing about this telescope... is it can point really, really accurately... and hold its position, and it's the gyros that allow you to do that.
But they're in a tough spot.
MASSl M I NO: Got them?
GOOD: I got your legs.
MASSl M I NO:
I'm gonna move in a little bit.
GOOD: We'll stick Mass, my spacewalking partner... up inside the telescope, in the bowels of the science instruments.
MASSl M I NO:
We gotta be really careful around them.
And I'm a big goon and I've gotta get inside of there.
So this is the problem, how to get me inside of this really cramped place.
GOOD: He's gotta work in there, but he has to be perfectly still.
And he can only work with one hand... right there amongst the fixed-head star trackers.
They don't like to be bumped.
And, you know... you knock them off their axes and they're useless.
Then the whole telescope's useless.
[I NDISTl NCT CHATTER]
NARRATOR: Mike Massimino... otherwise known as Mass, has serviced Hubble once before.
- Got it.
- Fun today?
NARRATOR: John Grunsfeld, on the left, is an astrophysicist and mountaineer.
He's had more visits to Hubble than anyone else.
Boy, are we having fun this time?
NARRATOR: This'll be the first trip to space for Mike Good, known as Bueno.
He enjoys a slightly soggy hug from his wife Joan.
Soon they'll be saying their goodbyes to families and friends.
[I NDISTl NCT CHATTER]
Shuttle arm operator Megan McArthur describes the last hours before launch.
McARTH UR:
I always loved being by the ocean... surrounded by dunes and, you know, seaside plants.
It's very calming for me, down at Kennedy.
And it's just a nice place to go kind of relax... and let your mind wander a little bit... and relieve you from the different cares about getting ready to launch.
[PEOPLE CHEERl NG]
NARRATOR:
Launch day is finally here.
It's no secret that space is a dangerous place.
In the last two decades, 32 astronauts have put their own lives on the line... to give life to Hubble.
Each one of these men and women is a true hero.
NASA TECH [OVER PA]:
T-minus five minutes and counting.
WOMAN 1:
Go for orbiter APU start.
WOMAN 2: PLT, perform APU start.
MAN 1: OTC, PLT and mark.
WOMAN 3: SRO. MAN 2: SRO is go.
- You have a range clear to launch.
WOMAN 3: And CDR.
ALTMAN:
CDR and entire crew is go.
MAN 3: Okay, Scooter.
Look, it's a great day to go fly.
On behalf of the KSC processing and launch team I'd like to wish you, your crew... and the Hubble Space Telescope team a great mission. Good luck, Godspeed.
We'll see you back here in about 11 days.
Enjoy the ride, pal.
NASA TECH [OVER PA]: Nozzle check of the SRBs, firing chain is armed.
Sound suppression water system armed.
T-minus 10, nine... eight, seven... six, five... four, three... two, one.
And liftoff of space shuttle Atlantis!
[ALL CHEERl NG]
Atlantis on its way, all three engines now throttling down... as the vehicle passes through the area of maximum dynamic pressure.
Atlantis, go at throttle up.
ALTMAN:
Houston, Atlantis copies. Go at throttle.
NASA TECH [OVER PA]:
Approaching staging... the burnout of the twin solid rocket boosters.
Thrust tailing off and SRBs standing by for separation.
[CROWD APPLAUDl NG]
Separation confirmed.
Phenomenal first stage performance.
Atlantis is continuing in its due easterly course... to catch up with the Hubble Space
Telescope one last time.
GRUNSFELD: Hey Ray J, welcome to orbit.
- It's great to be here, Doug.
GRUNSFELD: How was that ride?
- It was wild, basically.
FEUSTEL:
I like this floating in space.
[CREW LAUGH lNG]
- You have something in here?
MASSl M I NO: My food is in my stomach.
- Best place to store food is your stomach.
- Mine was there temporarily.
- Now it's in my tummy.
- Well, hopefully it stays there.
You don't really shower.
You wet a washcloth with this.
This is our water-wetter thing.
It's kind of like a garden hose.
Let me show you how it works here.
All I can tell you about going to the bathroom in space is suction.
- FEUSTEL: Hey, John.
- Hey, Drew.
- What's going on?
- Not too much, what you doing?
- Hanging around.
- What are you, a bat?
Nope, just a spacewalker.
GRUNSFELD:
Those tears on the shield shell were...
NARRATOR: Day three.
Their first task is to capture Hubble.
ALTMAN: The rendezvous is basically us finding the telescope.
Now it's doing 17,500 miles an hour... so by the time we get right next to it... we're doing the same thing.
That's the tense part, are we going the right speed?
NARRATOR:
To make things even harder... in orbit the sun rises and sets every 90 minutes.
MASSl M I NO:
.03, I see you slowing down.
ALTMAN: Till we can finally come up right underneath the telescope... with it floating just inches away from the aft window... so that Megan can reach out with the arm and grapple it.
MASSl M I NO: Still 0.03 over the pin.
McARTH UR: Over the pin.
MASSl M I NO: Keep coming.
ALTMAN: Keep going.
MASSl M I NO: I see halfway down.
ALTMAN: Envelope out the window.
McARTH UR: Trigger.
MASSl M I NO: Timer.
McARTH UR: We got it.
MASSl M I NO: Close and capture.
McARTH UR: I got close and capture.
MASSl M I NO:
Congratulations. Awesome job.
ALTMAN: Houston, Atlantis,
Hubble has arrived on board Atlantis.
NASA GROUND COM: Atlantis, Houston, we copy. Nice job, Megan... it's great to be back with the telescope.
McARTH UR: Once we have the telescope hovering over the latches... the idea is to just bring it straight down... slow enough so that if we did perhaps tap into the latches at all... that no damage would be done.
NARRATOR:
This last mission to repair it... will be the most challenging and difficult of all.
These are our EVA, that means spacewalking... tool caddies, called mini workstations.
They have our tethers on them so we don't lose things. We can tether to stuff.
MASSl M I NO:
You always gotta have that on you.
FEUSTEL:
You gotta have these on.
MASSl M I NO: Drew?
FEUSTEL: Yeah.
MASSl M I NO:
This is your first spacewalk tomorrow.
What do you feel? What do you think?
- I'm excited. I'm getting excited.
- You're ready.
Seeing Hubble come into the payload bay was pretty amazing.
The rendezvous was fun and now we're ready to go.
I'm looking forward to putting in the Wide Field Camera.
- What's Wide Field gonna do?
- Unlock the secrets to the universe.
MASSl M I NO: That's right.
- Unlock more secrets of the universe.
- That's right.
MASSl M I NO: Right.
Getting dressed the day of a spacewalk, you know, it's very hard... just like a little kid going out in the snow... to get all those clothes on.
You needed your mom.
One of the last things you wanna do... because once your helmet goes on, you can't touch your face any longer, is scratch.
GRUNSFELD:
Ah, what a beautiful view.
MASSl M I NO: It's just a wondrous sight to see our planet in its entirety.
It's a gift that astronauts have been given.
NARRATOR: Day four: The installation of the critical Wide Field Camera.
Right off the bat, trouble for John and Drew.
One stuck bolt.
ALTMAN: The start of the spacewalk had been a little bit delayed.
We were kind of up against the clock to begin with.
And then running into that bolt.
I'm thinking, you know,
"We are right at the edge here.
Our number-one science objective would be out the window on the first spacewalk."
GRUNSFELD: First roller's going in.
Bring your down... End down slightly.
NARRATOR: With a lot of perseverance, the Wide Field Camera is finally installed.
GRUNSFELD: Okay, that's good.
NARRATOR:
Day five brings the delicate task... of replacing the three Rate Sensor Units... known as RSUs.
If you're gonna be an astronaut, you gotta get used to the acronyms.
Tiny cameras inside the spacewalkers' helmets... give us a unique over-shoulder view as they work.
The new RSU is attached to a giant toothpick called a pick stick.
Very carefully,
Bueno guides it into position.
One bump against the star tracker could cripple the telescope forever.
One down, two more to go.
For the next one,
Mass goes in backwards.
GOOD: Okay, your feet are on the boot plate here, left foot a little bit left.
- Okay, so, I'll take your right foot in first. MASSl M I NO: Okay.
GOOD: Right toe's coming in.
Uh... Heel inboard.
MASSl M I NO: Okay.
NARRATOR:
By nightfall, they're in trouble.
GOOD:
Anything sticking out the back of that?
MASSl M I NO: I don't know.
NARRATOR:
This RSU just will not go in.
MASSl M I NO:
Coming off the plate.
GOOD: Doesn't feel seated.
MASSl M I NO:
I don't think it is.
GOOD: I'm hitting something on the bottom right now. I can't come down anymore.
MASSl M I NO:
See if you can drive it, it might work.
Now go left a little bit, just little, little, little.
Little bit more, little bit more right.
Little more, roll right.
Okay, now come, come in.
NARRATOR:
After hours of exhausting attempts... in minus 200 degree temperatures...
GOOD: I've definitely got it.
GRUNSFELD: Excellent. Do the next bolt.
MASSl M I NO: Yeah, that bolt is in.
NARRATOR: Success at last.
MASSl M I NO: Great job, Mike.
GRUNSFELD: Houston, Atlantis.
We're ecstatically able to report... the RSU-3R connectors are mated.
CREW: Whoo!
NASA GROUND COM:
Copy that and nice job by all.
JOH NSON: Okay, Mass, Bueno.
EVA-2, what do you think?
- It was like... Go ahead.
- No, go, you go.
It was like a heavyweight fight.
Oh, my gosh.
RSUs, you love them?
- I love them now that they're over.
- Love them to death!
- It's a good one to have behind us.
McARTH UR: What name would you give...
- the three RSUs?
- Larry, Curly and Moe!
MASSl M I NO: Okay, you guys know the drill, let's remove COSTAR.
McARTH UR: Coming out slow.
MASSl M I NO:
We use lots of tethers... tethers for everything, because stuff in space floats.
You don't wanna lose your stuff.
And you don't wanna lose yourself either.
FEUSTEL:
This is a lot tighter than... Heh.
COSTAR's, I think, the tightest instrument.
MASSl M I NO: We're really dependent on our spacesuit to keep us alive.
We don't wanna get a rip or a tear in our suit... because outside of our spacesuit is space, and in space there's no air.
There's nothing to keep us alive.
And the part of our suit that's most vulnerable is our gloves.
MASSl M I NO: Drew, I have a warning for you.
There's a possible finger pinch hazard... when you're stowing COSTAR in the aft fixture, so be careful.
FEUSTEL: Thanks, Mike. MASSl M I NO:
You're stuck inside of that suit.
It's not quite Barneys New York.
It's good, but it doesn't come with its own restroom or cafeteria.
FEUSTEL: Continue down.
McARTH UR:
Copy, continuing down.
FEUSTEL: Top down, and left.
Well, I just finished shooting an lMAX scene... and so I'm done with that.
So I wanna get a little exercise in... before I shoot my next scene... so this is a little stress relief here on the middeck.
NARRATOR: Most of Hubble's instruments were designed for repair in space.
But not the Advanced Camera for Surveys.
When its power supply failed... the only hope was to remove and replace fragile circuit boards inside the camera.
They were held captive by dozens of tiny screws.
For John and Drew, it's like performing brain surgery with oven mitts.
GRUNSFELD:
It takes all the focus I can muster.
I have 32 tiny screws to remove.
- Number 3 is out.
GOOD: Copy, Number 3.
GRUNSFELD: And so I have a Zen approach to doing the task... where I only think about the one specific task that I'm doing, the one specific screw.
And when that screw's out,
I move to the next screw.
Number 5 is out.
Okay, copy.
GRUNSFELD: And eventually I'll get to the last one, and then I'll be done.
There's no point thinking about how many screws I have ahead... or how many I've completed, it'll just be the one screw.
- Number 11 is out.
GOOD: Copy, 11 . Great.
NARRATOR: Removing the razor-sharp circuit boards is a dangerous business.
GRUNSFELD:
We learned what to avoid touching... because if you make a significant cut in your glove through the bladder... the oxygen will leak out of your suit and you will die.
- Card 1 is out.
GOOD: That looks great, John. Nice job.
GRUNSFELD:
Somehow I don't think brain surgeons... go, "Yahoo!" when they pull something out.
ALTMAN: When they came in, they were tired, they were exhausted, thirsty... but they were getting out of their suits with a sense of accomplishment.
Now the sad news was that once they relaxed for... oh, about five seconds... we had to put them back to work getting everything ready for the next day.
MASSl M I NO: Drew, what are you doing?
- I'm using the tape.
MASSl M I NO: Ls there a reason why you have sunglasses on in the middeck...
- where there's no sun?
- They look cool.
MASSl M I NO: Ah. That's my man.
NARRATOR: On day seven,
Mass and Bueno run into a big problem.
MASSl M I NO:
Doesn't look good, Drew.
Before we can do any of this, all this fancy stuff... we had to get off this big handrail that was in the way.
I don't think it's coming out.
It was a night pass. It was dark out... which added to the trauma. It seemed kind of cold and lonely out there.
I couldn't wake up out of this nightmare that was occurring.
NARRATOR:
After hours of failed attempts... the flight controllers finally tell them, "Just break it off."
GRUNSFELD: Think we're gonna be able to get this, Drew?
I do actually.
I think once he busts off the handrail... the rest is gonna go smooth as silk.
FEUSTEL: Okay, Mass.
MASSl M I NO: Here we go.
[THUMPl NG]
MASSl M I NO: It's off!
GOOD:
Easy, easy, Mike. Just real easy, okay?
MASSl M I NO: There we go.
- I got it.
FEUSTEL: Looked like it all stayed intact with the tape.
MASSl M I NO: Yeah, it did. I don't think we even scattered any debris.
- I see STIS in front of me.
FEUSTEL: Awesome.
MASSl M I NO: Now there's lots of planets out there in other solar systems.
One of the cool things about STIS is it can analyze the atmospheres of those planets.
What everybody's hoping is maybe we find something similar... to what we have here on Earth.
And then we hit the jackpot.
Guess what, it fits.
FEUSTEL: That's awesome.
NARRATOR:
For Drew, it's one more spacewalk to go.
GRUNSFELD:
And Mass, I do have a tether.
FEUSTEL: In case it floats away.
NARRATOR: He and John are replacing a Fine Guidance Sensor.
When it's locked on a target... it will be like holding a laser beam steady on a dime... that's 200 miles away.
GRUNSFELD: Ls the mirror clean?
FEUSTEL: Oh, yeah, the mirror's clean.
It's very clean. Wow.
GRUNSFELD: What?
FEUSTEL:
This is an amazing view of Hawaii.
NARRATOR: It has been said that in the process of going to the moon... we discovered Earth.
Seeing it from here, you experience a new appreciation... for the perfect utopia we inhabit.
FEUSTEL: Fantastic!
NARRATOR: In all our searching, we have yet to find another planet... that could nourish and protect us as it does.
In our future journeys away from our sheltering Earth... we'll need all the amazing skills and teamwork of this crew.
The same courage and inventiveness that has restored Hubble... to its full capacity and beyond.
MASSl M I NO:
Now it's time for our favorite segment:
Scooter's Corner.
- He's actually in his real corner.
- This is my seat...
- Wait, I've got gum.
- What are you gonna do with that?
I put it under the dash.
Maybe the next guy can enjoy it.
- There you have it.
- You know, I was afraid I'd say:
"Bye, Hubble. Waah."
But no, you know, we did it.
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yes.
Steve Lindsey,
I was just kidding about the gum.
Don't eat it, you might get sick.
Never know who's been there.
NARRATOR: On day nine, above the Sahara, the crew returns the telescope to orbit.
They'll return safely home to their families... knowing they've exceeded every expectation.
GRUNSFELD:
When we look back 500 years from now...
I believe that Hubble will be judged... one of the truly remarkable inventions of humankind.
Hubble addresses such fundamental questions:
How did planets form?
Where did we come from?
Where did the universe come from?
How did the pieces... the chemical elements that we're made of, form?
All these things that allowed us to be here, to build a Hubble... to look out into the cosmos.
NARRATOR:
And already, what wonders we now see.
The new Wide Field Camera captures a huge pillar of newborn stars... in the Carina Nebula.
The infant stars here are hidden... but Hubble's new infrared eye can peer through the veil of gas and dust... revealing for the first time a magical treasure trove of young stars.
An exquisite butterfly signals the spectacular death of a star.
Its wings are boiling caldrons of gas... spewing out at 600,000 miles an hour... from the dying star at its heart.
Millions of stars at a glance... in Omega Centauri.
Our eyes see only the middle-aged white stars, like our sun.
But in a single combined infrared and ultraviolet view... the new Wide Field shows us the extreme temperatures of stars.
We know that older stars become cooler, ballooning into red giants.
Intensely hot stars... some burning the last of their fuel before they die, shine bright blue.
All the stars we see in our night sky... are but a tiny handful of a few hundred billion stars in our galaxy.
This giant disk of stars, gas and dust... is our home in the universe.
We call it the Milky Way.
Our nearest neighbor is some two and a half million light-years away.
It's another spiral galaxy named Andromeda.
We're the largest members of our local group... of about three dozen galaxies.
Yet our small group is like a village, far from the bright lights of the big city.
In the distance is a metropolis called the Virgo Cluster.
It glows with the light of over 2000 galaxies... of every shape and size.
In the center of the Virgo Cluster... is a giant elliptical galaxy called Messier 87... perhaps 10 times the size of our Milky Way.
At its heart is a super-massive black hole... spewing a jet of high-energy radiation... huge distances across the galaxy.
Virgo's collection of 2000... is but a small drop in an ocean of galaxies.
Hubble is now peering deeply into a tiny region of the sky... looking back across time towards the very edge of the observable universe.
The further back we travel in time... the more misshapen and less developed the galaxies appear.
The objects we're now seeing... are 10 billion light-years away.
Their light began to cross the universe towards us... billions of years before the Earth existed.
From this small sliver of a view... astronomers estimate... there may be a hundred billion galaxies across the universe.
Immense strings of galaxies crisscross the cosmos... collecting into vast clusters and super-clusters... where the strings intersect.
On the largest scale, the structure resembles a cosmic web of galaxies... spanning the universe.
Billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars.
Doesn't it make you wonder?
Will we ever find anywhere as perfect as our own planet Earth?
Hubble has given us a renewed perspective on the place we call home.
We now know how important it is to protect this fragile oasis... deep within the boundless reaches of Hubble's magnificent universe.
[English - US - SDH]
I dont believe it.
It makes no sense.
"There is something so strange."
"Perhaps you could suggest some fantastic explanation. "
"Could'nt it be this sort of thing"
He turned the drawing round.
"Yes," she said,
"That is what I mean."
This was the first explanation of the splitting the atom.
Robert Oppenheimer said:
"Impossible."
But within 15 minutes he decided it was real.
He realised it would release some great amount of energy,
That you could generate power and make bombs.
Within one week, on
Oppenheimer's black board
There was a drawing of the bomb.
Enrico Fermi stood in his office and looked out of  Manhattan.
He kept  his hand to the size of a tennis balll.
"A little bomb like that" He said
"And it would all  disappear."
Countdown To Zero
There is no doubt in my mind if the terrorists had acquired a nuclear weapon,
They would not have hasitated to use it.
SoI guess the question is:
Could They Ever Get One?
Al-Qaida is determined to acquire nuclear weapons and use them if they get them.
In the early 90's they tried to buy highly enriched uranium in Sudan
They got scammed
Just prior to the
9/11 attacks we do know that Osama bin Laden and his lieutinent Zawahiri sat down with two
Pakistani nuclear scientists and discussed nuclear weapons.
Before releasing sarin gas in the Tokyo subway the Japanese cult
Aum Shinrikyo attempted  to acquire a nuclear bomb in Russia.
They bought a sheet farm in Australia to mine uranium to build their own bomb.
The objective of Al-Qaeda is: is to kill 4 million Americans including two million children
This is in his calculations, the..which is required to balance the scales of justice.
He takes various incidents from Shatila to the war in Iraq, and counts up the bodycount and says
"Thats how many people we owe: 4 million. "
You are not going to get
4 million people killed by hijacking airplanes and crashing  them into buildings.
Actually, I am not that worried about nuclear weapons.
Its not one of my main worries.
Isnt everyone worried about nuclear weapons?
There are all concerned nuclear war?
Thats a stupid answer, no
I don't know. Its never been something that I actually had to think in my everyday life.
It might get on your conscience and maybe then disappears
I do not think anybody is going to use in this day and age it is ridiculous to even think about it.
What can you do?
Nothing.
At the end of the day a small button and there is going to be a big mess at the end of that
Somebody is going to make a mistake one day and we are all going to suffer for it.
There are three ways to acquire a nuclear weapon:
You could steal a bomb,
You could buy a bomb and you could build a bomb.
Of all the things I've learned after 9/11, about terrorism iintent the most startling discovery for me personally was realising they were trying to build a bomb.
The hardest part of making a nuclear bomb is getting the material, highly enriched uranium or plutonium.
Many countries have these materials, and often they are poorly guarded
But if I were a terrorist intending  to build a nuclear bomb, and i wanted to blow up a major city
I would look to the countries of the former Soviet Union.
There have been many cases involving the theft of highly enriched uranium or plutonium.
And every time there has been a black market ceasure of stolen HEU or plutonium andthey were able to track to its source
It came from Russia.
There was a case at a Russian naval base in the early 1990s.
One of the naval personel told a relative of his where the highly enriched uranium at this place was
This relative walked through a gapping hole and a security fence walked upto what you and i would consider to be a tool shaft snapped the lock with an iron bar.
He set off no alarm.
It was not detected at all.
The Russian military prosecutor in that case said, quote:
"Potatoes were guarded better ".
At a facility called Luch, where they fabricate fuel made from
highly enriched uranium, there was a worker  there who knew that as long as the output was within about 3 percent of the input they figured it was normal loses to waste and they didnt bother to investigate.
So he kept stealing small amounts of highly enriched uranium day after day, over  a long period of time.
Eventually he stole a kilogram and a half of 90%  of highly enriched uranium
He set off no alarms.
Noone noticed.
He had friends who were making their living stealing car batteries.
And they said:
"Maybe the guy in Moscow who buys or is still  in car batteries
"will Buy your stolen uranium . "
So they went down to the train station  together, and the police came in and arrested the car battery thieves and he got arrested along with them
Thats the only way he was ever caught .
We have cases in which people from the Russian nuclear arsenal were sellling material and they were captured
We have cases in which  people from
Russian nuclear labs were selling materials they was captured.
Almost all of those cases until the material was seized and had never been noticed to have been missing.
All  the black market seizures that
I am ware of were serendepetous
They were caught by luck.
So we dont know weather it is the iceberg or the tip of the iceberg.
Once you have managed to acquire highly enriched uranium, you need to smuggle it out of the country
Georgia is located along Russia's southern border and things like highly enriched uranium could be smuggled from such a place by Azerbaijan,
Iraq, Iran,
Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and so on so forth.
The Georgians invented a so called man
of Turkish nationality who said he was  a Muslim and representing a serious organization.
Oleg Khintsagov believed he was selling highly enriched uranium to make an atomic weapon to terrorists
If a  truck driver can get hold of it, a small time husler who just wants to become a rich guy imagine what professionals could have done
Real professionals with an ideology, with an agenda with brains
Once you have moved the highly enriched uranium, you could use any number of ports in the Middle East or the Mediterranean to ship the
HEU to your destination. smuggling highly enriched Uranium into the United States, is pretty straight forward lead pipe will shield the HEU.
The detector would have be within a few inches to pick up any radiation.
And then hide it amongst everyday goods
A hundred pounds of highly enriched uranium is  smaller than a football.
It would fit in a 6 pack beer cans
100 000 shipping containers go to the united states everyday
Every way the drugs come to new york city would be the same way you would imagine highly enriched uranium coming.
If you have any doubt about the ability of al-Qaeda to bring highly enriched uranium into the U.S.
They could always hide it a bale of marijuana.
Terrorism is just one threat the deliberate threat.
There is also the unintentional threat of a nuclear detonation by accident,by  error or by misjudgment.
We like to think that the U.S. military or other military who are controlling nuclear weapons are perfect organizations , they will never fail .
We expect them  to have 100% reliability.
But even the well-disciplined, very professional U.S military made serious serious mistakes with nuclear weapons.
 An atomic bomb breaks loose from a  mounting shakle </ i>
in a  B-47 jet over
Florence, South Carolina, </ i>
 causing a sensational freak accident.</ i>
 A B-52 bomber was loaded with nuclear weapons by mistake </ i>
 An American airplane flew 1500 miles across the nation we are told, </ i>
 with six nuclear warheads on aboard. </ i>
 And nobody knew. not the aircraft crew, </ i>
 not the commanders on ground. </ i> we have had B-52's explode in the air during refueling mission causing 4 thermonuclear weapons to fall onto the Spain territory and into  the Mediterranean.
 A B-52 bomber carrying nuclear weapons </ i>
 crashed near U.S
Air Force space in Greenland, </ i>
 scattering deadly plutonium over the icecap. </ i>
In 1960, a BOMARC air defence missile exploded, melting a nuclear warhead.
In 1968, the USS Scorpion sank
400 miles southwest of Azores.
Nuclear weapons on board were never found.
A B-47 bomber disappeared over the Mediterranean.
Nuclear weapons on board were never located.
In 1959, an aircraft crashed near
Whidbey Island, Washington.
The nuclear debt charges were not recovered.
Skyhawk's strike aircraft carrying a nuclear weapon rolled off an aircraft carrier in the Sea of Japan
The weapon was never recovered.
There are many ways in which  efforts to make a system more reliable actually backfire and make it less reliable
Sometimes we had a redundant system. and backup systems so that if one fails, another can take its place.
But complexity is the enemy of reliability.
Because as you add system is making more complex because its harder  to understand all the potential interactions.
Its that unlikely bizzare interaction where one person interacts with another in a way that wasnt anticipated or one backup system interacts with another in ways that you cant figure out ahead of time and therefore cant plan around
Those are what cause the problems
In 1961, a B-52 broke apart in midair over  Goldsboro,
North Carolina causing two nuclear bombs to fall
One parachute functioned properly, and that bomb survived with minor damage
The other parachute failed to open
When that bomb hit five of six safety devices malfuntioned
A single switch prevented a nuclear explosion.
When i worked in the Pentagon i believed that the likelyhood
of a nuclear weapons accident in the United States occuring was very low
I still believe that
But low probablity events happen they happen all the time.
There's a first time in history for every event.
Eventually those low probablity events will occur
No! That supposed to happen?
Like there is probably every country in the world today
How many countries do i  think have nuclear weapons?
- List them?
- China.
I dont think i suckup for this.
- UK. may be
America i'm guessing
Oh. Oh. Us Oh
I .. that was a given
- France.
- Germany?
- Australia?
- Canada? I do not think Canada
- No, not Japan.
- There's more. I know there's more.
Iraq, Iran,
Saudi Arabia.
All other countries. They are not
 telling us. They have them
- Afghanistan?
- North Korea?
- North Korea.
-Do they?Ok, North Korea.
Who knows?Who knows exactly?
I think that's it.Yeah
After  the United States detonated. the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert nuclear technology began to spread and other countries began to acquire their own nuclear bombs.
Great credit is due for this mighty British achievement for it seems that by the  possession of such
deadly weapons peace can be maintained in this troubled world
At Reggane, deep in the Sahara
France goes forward with the detonation
 of her  first atomic bomb. </ i>
 The explosion carries France a step forward </ i>
 towards the dream of General. de Gaulle towards  national glory restored . </ i>
 This is a giagantic success of Mao Tse-Tung's thought. </ i>
Our nations first nuclear test
 surpasses the levels of the first nuclear tests </ i>
of  the United States,
Britain and France. </ I>
 Their criminal intent to block and prevent our nations</ i>
 people from nuclear weapons </ i>
 have been thoroughly smashed</ i>
 Pakistan, which has often went to war with India, </ i>
 might now have to join the once select nuclear community </ i>
 in self defense and warned: </ i>
 "numbers in the nuclear club will not stop at six"</ i>
One Prime Minister of Pakistan said
Pakistan would build a nuclear weapon even if it meant that the people would have to eat grass
"We will make the bomb even if we have to eat grass. "
 In Karachi, they poured into the streets </ i>
pulling the symbol of the power they were celebrating. </ i>
 The bomb has become a source of national pride. </ i> thought there was a jubliation in the streets of Pakistan.
The first time we achieved something which places us in the ranks of very very few countries of the world.
We were proud of our scientists, we were proud of our capabilities, we were proud of our strength.
The people thought that :
"Now let India do anything to Pakistan.
"Let's see what they do."
I had North Korean officials say to me a lesson they took away  from the toppling of Saddam Hussein was that
Saddam was ousted because he didnt have a bomb
They were not going to let the same
 thing happen to Kim Jong-Il.
Therefore,they needed to have a bomb.
North Korea has feared of disappearing into what the communists used to call the "dustbin of history," like all their other communist friends and they see the nukes as the one thing that makes them the country that is taken seriously by the U.S and the other big players in the neighbourhood
Every country has enemies.
Every country can use self defense as a  rationale for acquiring nuclear weapons.
But if every country does so it is a much more dangerous world.
 When we see something that is technically sweet, </ i>
 you do it . </ i>
That is the way it was the atomic bomb.
 The father of the atomic bomb,
Robert Oppenheimer </ i>
 gave some frank answers to some important questions in 1947. </ i>
I have been asked whether in the years to come will it be
pssible to kill
40 million American people </ i>
 in the 20 largest
American towns </ i>
by the use of atomic bombs </ i>
in a single night. </ i>
 I am afraid  that the answer to that question is yes. </ i>
I have been asked whether there is hope for the naions security </ i>
 In keeping secrets some of the knowledge </ i>
 which has gone into the making of the bombs. </ i>
I am afraid there is no such hope
A nuclear weapon in a sense is the most simple configuration of
nuclear material that you can imagine
You just bring together certain quantity of fissile material highly enriched uranium or plutonium and if you do it right it will explode.
The design of the first atomic bomb was a very deep secret
In fact that was a time when people didnt even know whether a bomb was possible.
Now the making of the atom bomb has become  much easier.
Those who say that building a nuclear weapon is easy
They are very wrong
Those who say building a crude device is very difficult
They are more wrong
Do you agree with that statement?
I wont comment on that statement
- Okay, Alright
People from the U.S Nuclear laboratory were testified to a classified section to the Congress and they said it would be possible make a nuclear bomb with all parts being
Commercially available except from the actual nuclear material
Senator Biden asked the heads of the three weapons labs:
Is it possible?"Is it really possible that the terrorists could do this? "
They said "yes."
They said:"This is something that we test our graduate students from time to time.
"We take two students who havnt been  prepared for doing this"
We tell them: "See if you can make a bomb that would work. "
"And on the whole most of them passed this test"
Biden said: "Prove it"
And so  they went and made a nuclear bomb, with everything other than the nuclear material, from commercial parts.
They actually brought it in to the classified hearing room in the Senate.
Typically, an implosion
 bomb would have something like a
25 kg of uranium,which is about the size of a grapefruit.
If, lets say, between
70 and a 100 kg of HEU is available, then the design is not a major factor.
It would not be very efficient. it would not use all the uranium that was used in it. and yet it would be enough to level a city
During my 10 years as prime minister, what i really noticed was that it was actually the threat of the proliferation, the fact that these weapons could fall into other peoples hands
That was the thing that troubled me, that kept me awake at night.
 In the capital, Islamabad, </ i> word hit the streets in early afternoon:
Another nuclear device 
 tested successfully. </ i>
As 
Pakistan celebrated, </ i>
 the public hailed AQ Khan as the father of the Islamic bomb. </ i>
In 1974, AQ Khan was working  at a company that was developing a brand new process of enriching uranium
He stole their designs and took
 the list of all the suppliers.
At the end of the day he is not really a master scientist but he is a master smuggler and a master organizer.
He knows how to get the pieces out of the countries and how to find stuff and buy stuff
There was this whole plan to start an operation setup by the intelligence services, by the army and by Dr. Khan
Restrictions were placed
Sanctions were placed.
But somehow the pakistanis got around that and the formal help actually came from India's enemy- China
China gave a blueprint of a nuclear bomb to Pakistan.
Around early 1980s,
Khan makes contact with the Iranians, who were very  interested in getting a bomb but clearly dont have the scientific or industrial capacity to do it themselves
And thus he starts on a a commercial enterprise.
Khan has got a full  marketing regime laid out
brochures and videos tapes that offers nuclear wares
It extremely lucrative business
He had extensive contacts, networks, and he didnt much care about
 who the ultimate client was going to be
He contacted Iran
North Korea, Libya, but he didnt just give them the technologies
He also took the bomb designs that the Pakistanis had and threw those in as a sweetner
He gave them 24/7  technology support
Got a problem?
Call 1-800-AQKHAN.
It was a full service operation
The U.S. intelligence began to focus on AQ Khan in the  late 1990s.
The homerun  was in
December 2003 with Libya.
The CIA and British Intelligence essentially caught the Khan network red handed
Selling a full scale nuclear weapon to Libya.
If it wasnt for AQ Khan,
Libya never would have got the centrifuges but that they have thankfully today given up
If it wasnt for AQ Khan, there wouldnt be an Iranian nuclear program
Iran is the tip of the spear
It's the big problem that we have to solve.
They promised not to build nuclear weapons, but the problem is that the very same centrifugals very  same factory that can enrich uranium to low quantities for nuclear fuel can enrich it to high quantities for nuclear weapons.
So the question is:
Do you trust Iran?
By their own admission they have deceived inspectors about their nuclear activities
 for 17 years.
Without question Iran is trying
 to get a nuclear bomb.
They have made that very clear, despite their promises that they are only pursuing civil and peaceful objectives for their nuclear program.
They are really good
They are trying to bring things in that can be used for their nuclear program
The Iranians have worked very hard to hiding and disguising their facilities
Many of their facilities are in crowded urban areas underground, extremely well protected from any sort of aerial bombing
If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons capability the impact is across the whole of the the region
We will get a whole set of other countries deciding they have got to acquire
 nuclear weapons capability
Syria, Saudi Arabia,
Turkey, Egypt ... the rivals of the Iranian
Shite state would match their capabilities and would go from the Middle East with one nuclear armed nation Israel to one with three, four or five nuclear armed nations
They are surrounded by very unstable regimes and countries  .
If Iran acquires everything it needs, without doubt pieces of that become more readily available to terrorist organizations like Hamas.
The risk that you have today with regimes like
Iran or North Korea is  they are prepared to start trading that  nuclear weapons capability and  technology.
The Pakistanis had the nuclear know how. they didnt have a delivery system.
The North Koreans had the missile, and didnt have the nuclear know how
So there was a natural convergence of interests here
The North Koreans have a long track record of selling military technology
and missiles to the Syrians,to the Iranians, to the Iraqis, Pakistanis.
They dont really have any other exports.
Daily life is very real
Food is in short supply you  drive around the capital,Pyongyang, at night and its basically dark.
There is a famous satellite photo that shows the
Korean peninsula. and in the south, we see all these lights, and then its just black we are still dealing with his years of unchecked activities and contacts and its really a genie out of the bottle that cannot be easily put back
We spend billions of dollars putting in radiation detectors but highly enriched uranium is easily shielded
If you are depending on portal monitors to defend a city against a nuclear detonation,
You have done far too much too late
Nuclear weapons dont have to be exactly on target.
Close is good enough.
If  a terrorist thinks that the portal monitor might detect weapon, they set it off in the port. highly enriched uranium is easy to smuggle the radiation is very weak.
The detectors that we are putting in place now would have no chance of detecting
HEU in a cargo container.
The signature of highly enriched uranium is so slight that they would have to set the monitors very high to detect it,and so they are getting thousands of false alarms
 every day.
Toilets, will set it off china
Ceramics, stones like granites, lot of biological materials like tobacco, some algae, televisions ,the old style televisions, kitty litter,lot of chemical products, and well other stuff also
You wants to smuggle a bomb into the United States?
Ship it in a truck with a kitty litter
No one would ever find it
They are great for really
radioactive stuff, like cesium or something that might be used in a "dirty bomb."
But for the stuff that you would use to make a nuclear bomb that would incenerate the heart of a major city they are not gonna detect that.
Robert Oppenheimer in 1946, he appeared in a closed door session of the Senate, and one of the senators asked him if nuclear terrorism was a potential threat.
He said "Of course"
"Terrorists could bring a bomb into New York City
"And destroy the city."
Somebody asked him :
"How would you stop it?"
He said:
"With a screwdriver,
"To open up every container that comes into this city. "
Once you have smuggled the highly enriched uranium into the U.S.you  would need a place to build the bomb.
The bomb could be built right in the target city.
The hard part was what we did in 1945.
The hard part is doing it the first time.
This is no longer a conceptual challenge
There is no trick.
There is no magic that needs to be figured out
It's really just an engineering challenge
It's definitely not rocket science.
The rocket science is more difficult.
you can make a very simple weapon, a so called  gun type weapon which was the one used in Hiroshima
It was so simple we didnt even test it before we dropped it
It is essentially just a gun barrel. with a target and you can projectile, and you propel the projectile into the target. you will need an artillary gun to fire a one piece of HEU in the other, which would be bolted onto the muscle of the gun
The military sells these things as surplus, but they sell them  to save it
You would have to make the gun capable of shooting again and you would want to test fire the gun to make sure that that it fired the projectile at the right speed.
This is  the only thing that you would need to do off-site. you would need a group of people ... lets say,between 15 to 20 to 25, who would be knowledgable in particular aspects of weapons designs of explosives.
Two or three people to do the  machining, two or three people to work on the gun two or three people to work on electronics,
People who are experts in ballistics
People who know something about nuclear physics. you just need the machinist and metallar just to make the pieces into the right shapes and make sure they fit together
Ordinary explosives and detonators maybe some electronic equipment.
You can go online and easily find the blade for  $ 10,000. you could find the furnace for about $ 50,000.
And you can even find the surplus recoilless rifle probably also for $ 10,000.
More than 90% of the effort in the Manhattan Project was making the nuclear material to make the nuclear bomb.
If you can get hold of that nuclear material, then it doesnt take a
Manhattan Project to make a bomb.
If the circumstances are right, acquiring a complete bomb may be easier than building one
In Algeria, in 1961, officers within the French millitary rebelled and tried to seize a nuclear weapon.
As the rebels closed in the weapon was detonated in a degraded explosion to prevent it from falling into the hands of the rebelling  officers.
The Japanese death terror cult, Aum Shinrikyo, attemted to buy a nuclear bomb from the Soviet Union.
They had a lot of resources,
We are talking well over billion dollars of assets. and secondly they had
tremendous access. At one point, the group had more members in Russia in the
 former Soviet Union than they had in Japan
In 1994, a senior leader made eight trips to Russia
His personal notebook included a shopping list for buying a nuclear warhead for $ 15 million.
A perfectly secure  nuclear weapon is also a perfectly unusable one
So here one has this paradox
 between security and usability
Where is the worlds most dangerous place right now? mu money it is  Pakistan. you have got an  unstable government, plus enough material for up to a 100 nuclear weapons, plus Osama bin Laden in the country.
What we have seen over the last two or three years has been a spiral that has
 been going downwards
Destabilization,the spread of the Taliban, the spread of radicalism, the collapse of the economy.
So could there be a cornals coup in Pakistan by Islamic radicals within the military and then could  nuclear
 weapons be at risk?
What happens if that country destablises?
What happens if the army splits?
Who gets the  weapons?
Who gets the material for the weapons?
Who gets the scientists who know how to build the weapons?
There is no such thing as perfect command and control over the  nuclear weapons, even in the sophasticated of the arsenals. from the levels of the presidents gone down there are human weaknesses, technical problems deficiencies and vulnerabilities.
I was the launch officer  for
Minuteman missiles. and I spent three years in Montana in a hole in an undergorund launch control centre
I was one of the guys responsible for for getting these missiles off ground in one minute. we didnt call them
"Minuteman missiles" for nothing.
When I was serving in the Air Force as the launch officer, there was a device in the launch control centre into which 12 digits had to be dialed in in order to unlock the missiles for firing
This had been  installed under Robert McNamara over the objections of the Strategic Air Command
Since they couldnt prevent the panel from being installed the StrategicAir Command in Omaha had set these codes to zero and we all knew it.
That was the secret unlock code for firing our missiles:
12 zeros.
In fact, in our launch check list we had to  ensure that the unlock code was set to al zeros before we completed the launch sequence.
This changed in 1977 when they started using actual codes.
But until then, I and one other crew member could have actually formatted a launch order a completely valid launch order and transmitted it to the entire American stratergic arsenal.
Looks like we are in a shooting war
Oh hell.Oh the russians have got it?
i think: Thats what i have been told </ i> just came in on the red phone.
My orders are toseal this base tight and thats what i mean to do, seal it tight
Now I want you to transmit Plan R
"R" for "Robert" to the wing.
- Plan "R",for "Robert".
- Is it that bad, sir? looks like its pretty hairy
- Yes, sir.
I remember watching
"Dr. Strangelove" and thinking  they had it all wrong.
You dont need to be a general.
We were only lieutenants, but we could have started
World War III just as easily as Gal. Jack Ripper.
We could have triggered implementation of the U.S. nuclear war plan involving thousands and thousands of nuclear weapons fired at the
Soviet Union and China.
 Standby
Message followed </ I>
 Alpha, Tango, Golf, Reamer. </ i>
The life of a watch officer is really Pavlovian.
You have been   trained and conditioned so thoroughly you kind of march up a long step
into a very  well rehearsed script thats written by check lists.
 Step 1: All keys inserted. </ i>
Roger
We would jump up unlock our safe take out codes
Check the codes against the mesage and then proceed through a launch check list that takes about one minute to carry an armour
Lets enable the missiles.
Key program activated. </ I>
All  in flight. BF all.
Unlock code inserted. </ I>
Standby...
Unlock code inserted. enable
Its enabled.
At the end of that process to turn the keys and launch upto 50 missiles at Soviet Union and / or China.
Today, the position of
United States and Russia is exactly the same as it was during the Cold War.
So if the orders came down,during now
20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
It would take about two minutes to launch all of the US nuclear ballistic  missiles their tunnels in central U.S. out of their tubes in the midwest
It would time for the
Russians to do the same thing and then it would take another 10 to 12 minutes for everything else thats on
launch ready alert to be fired
So that within 15 minutes all the forces on the launch ready alert would be in the air in their flight to the other side of the planet.
2000 bombs strategic nuclear weapons, very high yield.
And they could kill over a 100 million
Russians and Americans within 30 minutes.
When we are working on nuclear apps control i found myself in a briefing in the Pentagon with a colonel we had a short exchange about this and in this context of this exchange he said:
"But I do not understand what would be such a big deal"
"If there was a nuclear exchange"
"Only about 500 million people would die.
"Life would go on afterwards."
And I can remember having a feeling like Woody Allen and recall
"I'm sorry i have got an appointment back on planet earth"
I dont think that anyone really knows how many nuclear weapons there are on the planet today.
- I have a ...
- Does anyone know?
May be thousands,i dont know
Far more than I know.
I do not know. 15 000.
There is enough firepower on a US nuclear sub to annihilate
 probably half the planet.
I have heard people say that we have enough
 nuclear weapons to create a new sun.
I think couple to eliminate this city.
Do you know how many are there?
We estimate that there are about
23 000 nuclear weapons in the world still.
The good news is there used to be 60 000.
So we have cut those arsenals by more than half.
But we, the United States, still has about
1,500  hydrogen bombs on missiles poised for launch in 50 minutes or less.
The really bad news is that the Russians have the same.
If the Russians fired missiles at the United States the first warning would come from satellites, and they could detect the flame from the booster rocket within seconds, easily within a minute.
Suddenly, this early warning hub in the United States would become very frenzy to try figure out whether this is a false alam or whether this is a real attack and determine this in 60 seconds.
The President would receive a briefing from the duty officer at Strategic Command Headquaters
That briefing of the President of his response options and their consequences has to be delievered in as little as 30 seconds
The president normally would have no more than 12 minutes to make a decision, and maybe its little as 10 seconds.
I knew that if the Soviets did launch an attack, that it would take 26 minutes for an
ICBM to leave russian soil and land in Washington or New York.
And I had that much time to decide how to respond.
And the timeline was very short
We had just a few minutes to make a decision how to respond at what level of intensity.
Somewhere before the 10th minute the order to execute would be issued
The Strategic Air Command probably would be airbourne by then just as a precaution.
There might be a Presidential evacuation so that the president would survive an attack on Washington
But I know of cases in which the President chose not to be evacuated
And roughly by the 28th minute, at the latest, those of us not evacuated would be dead.
For us it was a kind of suicide duty
Any missile landing within half a mile of our location would probably have killed us
If we had survived the attack, we were supposed to go to a randezvous farm
Our air will only
24 hours,
So we go out through an escape which was filled with sand
We would have to release the bolts on cover and let the sand fall through and then crawl up the tube
Our tube came up the parking lot so we would have to break through asphalt to get out
The randevous point be
50 or 100 kms away and we would have to walk.
Disnt really matter though
Everyone knew that the radiation would kill us quickly anyway and you would never make it to the rendezvous
In 1995, Pete Sampras won the
U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
George Clooney made his first big movie
A bomb destroyed the federal building in Oklahoma city
OJ Simpson was acquitted of murder.
And we also came close to  an accidental nuclear missiles launch.
On January 25, 1995, the United States  launched a rocket from Norway to study the northern hights
We told the Russians that we were gonna launch that rocket but  somebody must have forgot how to pass word on it
When they picked up the 4 stages of this rocket they initially interpreted this as 4 warheads from a U.S nuclear submarine which we often station off the coast of Norway possibly directed at Moscow.
That fit exactly the characteristics of the beginning of a nuclear strike
One missile, coming over exploding in the atmosphere and sending out an electromagnetic pulse that would fry all the electronics radar surveillance,
Computers in the country to be attacked, followed by an onslought of nuclear weapons
And for the first in the nuclear age, the Russians actually opened up the nuclear football
They went to
President Yeltsin, they opened up  the command and launch codes, the button, put on the desk and said:
"We are under attack."
Boris Yeltsin was basically given
5 minutes to decide what to do.
Fortunately, Yeltsin wasnt drunk and he didnt believe what the military was telling him.
He said:
"There must be some mistake."
Both the U.S. and Russia guide their nuclear response with a doctrine called
"Launch on Warning"
It is the policy if you believe that you are under attack you are supposed to launch the missiles. you dont wait for them to land.
According to Russian military doctrine
Boris Yeltsin should have launched all out nuclear attack on the United States that morning.
We do not know what happened in the Kremlin.
All we know is that he didnt.
There have been a no. of false alarms during the Cold War.
We have had ocassions where the rising moon was interpreted to be a
Russian ICBMs attack.
A flock of geese was thought to be bombers.
A training tape was slipped into a computer at our command and control headquarters at NORAD
Everyone involved thought there was an actual attack underway.
A tape was inserted into the early warning hub in Colorado that  simulated a large scale
Soviet nuclear attack.
And no one realised  that it was just a training tape until the U.S had gone into this sort of frenzy check list procedure to prepare for nuclear war.
Airborne command posts, actually,in some cases, took off.
The Presidents dooms day plane actually left its base in preparation for an incoming Soviet strike.
Senator Charles Percy happened to be there at the time and said there was absolute panic.
Another false alarm was caused by a computer chip malfuntion that generated indications of large scale
Soviet attack
We raised the alert levels.
Crews took launch codes out of their safes.
Inserted the keys into the launch switches.
Zbigniew Brzezinski was woken up in the middle of the night with the assured instruction that a nuclear attack is underway and that he had to go wakeup President Carter.
There was 8 minutes worth of nuclear launch preparations that were triggered by malfunctioning computer chip that costs less than a dollar.
And having  missiles on hair trigger is an accident waiting to happen.
As Fermi said about the physics:
"What isnt forbidden is compulsory,'' it will eventually happen.
There is nothing that makes the launch of nuclear weapons impossible
If the probability isnt zero, it will happen.
Right now the world has a policy that is based heavily on technology you keep something secret and you call it a day
But secrecy has half life.
Things leak out
Centrifuges happen to be the technology that is going to change the game.
They are going to democratize the process of building nuclear weapons.
Uranium exists everywhere on Earth.
Its more common than tin.
99.3% of all uranium is uranium 238, isotope that can not be used for nuclear weapons. except 0.7% that you need to separate out
A centrifuge
Its basically a tube.
It spins the uranium in gas form and pushes the heavier atoms towards the wall. and the lighter atoms from the center.
And you can skin off the light atoms
You do this over and over again.
Many dozens of times, and eventually you purify it to a level that you can use it as a bomb
The common risk in them is they are very complicated.
Technologies that take countries
decades to build and the highest achievements.
But the fact is, is that the centrifuges are
1950's technology.
And this is 2010.
Enriching uranium is still beyond the reach of the individual.
It is a  logistics feat, requiring thousands of centrifuges working for months or years.
But highly enriched  uranium is now within the grasp of nearly any country.
And once you have the HEU making a crude bomb is easy
We're not just  dicussing limits </ i>
 on a further increase of nuclear weapons. </ i>
 We seek instead to reduce their numbers. </ i>
We seek total elimination  
 one day</ i>
 of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth. </ i>
 Happy New Year, man. </ i>
 Happy New Year. </ i>
 I love you all. </ i>
In the first millionth of a second , the fireball is 500 feet across
Within 10 seconds, it would grow to over 1 mile
The temperature would rise to 20 million degrees Fahrenhiet hotter than the surface of the sun
The blast would generate winds in excess of 650 miles an hour
Forces of that magnitude can destroy anything that people can build.
Strongest Buildings would be reduced to rubble.
Tens of square blocks would just be
 melted, would just be evaporated
Everything would be vaporized: the buildings,the cars, the trees,the people, the upper level of earth itself
There were 76 000 buildings in Hiroshima.
70 000 of them were destroyed.
The hospitals,the fire stations the communications equipment; the military installations.
Everything just flattened.
In the first 5 to 6 miles, virtually everyone in that
5 mile radius is going to die.
Somewhere between 3&4 million people dead immediately in the first 5 miles
If you are lucky enough to be 8 or
9 miles away from the blast, then you would experience it as blast effects
Windows being shattered
It would shatter every window and turn it to hundreds of missiles flying outwards from the center of the explosion, at speeds more than
100 miles per hour
After the blast,
Its the firestorm that would combust everything
Everything flammable would burn paper, cardboard, cloth, heating oil, gasoline.
Everything would burn.
Whole blocks would catch fire.
Hundreds of thousands of fires would turn into a giant firestorm
11 miles across.
Everything catches fire
There just will be no air to breathe.
All the oxygen would be consumed and everyone would die.
It is useless to talk  about the way you die because you are burned to death or because you have been blown to bits by the blast
Anyone looking in the direction of the nuclear explosion they will be blinded.
The lungs would be ruptured by the pressure or the eardrums would be ruptured by the pressure. crush injuries from buildings falling, broken bones thrown in the air against the buildings
Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions would die from the fallout.
The body does have a repair rate for radiation but the doses are so heavy and coming  so quickly that it would overwhelm the body's repair mechanism
The 450 to 70 RAD dose kills you because of white cells or blood cells or you will go into seasures or immediate coma and you will die within a matter of minutes or hours.
Most of the doctors are going to be dead most of the nurses are going to be dead.
Most of the hospitals are going to be destroyed.
Huge number of casualties and no medical equipment.
They will be a need for antibiotics. tens of units of blood per person.
There wont be any electrical power
Vast amounts of intravenous fluids to sustain people that have
 been burned,just burned.
You couldnt treat all the burn victims.
And there comes a certain point the casualties become so high its pointless to try to make any sense out of it.
The doctor in the Red Cross Hospital who turns into an automaton,
And that's what desended on the physicians and nurses in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Someone would surely claim they had 10 more that were already hidden somewhere and then start setting them off and blast unless they meet their demands.
Every other big city is gonna wonder
-whether they might be a target.
- Pulic panic, the people fleeing major cities
You could forget about the rules of search and seizure.
You  are gonna have to be searching everywhere
You could  forget about civil liberties when people realize a whole city was just destroyed.
Take the Bill of
Rights,you put it on a shelf and you might never see it again.
People would be demanding draconian measures to make sure that another city didnt go up.
 Some people laughed. </ i>
 Few people cried. </ i>
Most  people were  silent. </ i>
I remembered the line from the Hindu Scripture, the Bhagavad Gita.
Vishnu ... trying to persuade the prince he should do his duty and to impress him, takes on his multiarmed form and says:
"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds. "
 Every man, woman and child </ i>
 lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles, </ i>
hanging by the slenderest of threads, </ i>
 capable of being cut at any moment </ i>
 by accident, or miscalculation or by madness. </ i>
. The weapons of war must be abolished  </ i>
before they abolish us. </ i>
The Cuban Missile Crisis endanger the very existence of our nation.
Wecame that close to nuclear war.
Neither the Soviet nor we, the US intended to put our nation at risk.
And the next time we may not be so lucky
They kill by the millions.
They kill in numbers that the human imaginations simply cannot comprehend.
I asked: "Well we have nuclear weapons
to prevent their use. " we now know that we live in a world in which, if we possession, if any one possesses, they will be used.
I dont see any good that a nuclear weapon
 could be a threat to the world.
In my opinion, you can  forget them.
I think they should be destroyed.
I think we are better off without them.
Theres a 183 countries in the world that do not have nuclear weapons.
Many of these countries could have nuclear weapons.
They have chosen not to have them.
We have decided to take al
180 degrees turn in South Africa
When I became
President
I was then informed that we have completed six devices more or less comparable to the bombs which were actually  used at Hiroshima.
I indicated that i would like us to stop this program and to become part of the mainstream world again
The only way to eliminate the threat of nuclear terrorism is to eliminate all nuclear weapons
 in all countries.
We have got to ensure that never once the terrorists suceed in detonating a nuclear weapon.
You think about nuclear security its all about the material
The simple  physical fact is that if you dont have fissile material ... either highly enriched uranium or plutonium  for example ... you cannot have a nuclear weapon.
The focus is all about material.
Stop  making new material.
Secure the material where you know it is around the world
And make sure that  you detect the illicit  transfer of material.
And then start getting rid of the material that you have
Today in the world we have about
1,700 tons of HEU.
So that's enough material for around the order of  50 to100 thousand weapons to really create a truely international system for these facilities.
International Fuel banks or International reprocessing centers... that would be a mauch safer world
We havnt lost an ounce of gold from Fort Knox.
We shouldnt lose an ounce of plutonium or highly enriched uranium.
During the Cold War,
I believed in the value of nuclear weapons to detter an attack.
20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, there is no excuse any longer for keeping nuclear weapons on launch ready laert
We can remove all of the warheads on our missiles , share our safe guards technology and establish a joint warning center to ensure Nuclear war cannot happen by mistake.
When I came into government in the early '1980s, the idea that within about10 years, both sides would have agreed to have 50%  reduction in their Nuclear weapons would have sounded absurd.
But we achieved it.
That  means a reduction of more than 5,000 nuclear warheads a piece
We have gone almost 20 years now without really any demonstrative steps to nuclear reductions
This has to be a step by step process
That's how we did it with chemical weapons.
These weapons are now taboo.
The Soviet Union imploded when I was Sec of State and we actually got an enforceable treaty where we goot Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Ukraine to give up their nuclear weapons.
All countries in the world have to sign a legally binding,
intrusively verifiable agreement to rid the world of nuclear weapons.
The choice we face is eliminate nuclear weapons or live in a world with
25 or 30 nuclear powers.
We can do this
There has to be a carefully orchestrated process of reductions
The United States and Russia, with 96% of the worlds nuclear weapons have to lead the way
We start in a world where there are 23,000 nuclear weapons.
The very  first step is to cut those arsenals dramatically in the United States and Russia.
Once you get down to low hundreds in the world then you have built up the confidence and the mechanisms to ensure that you can verify this process so that we can get rid of the last one
- None.
- Should be zero.
I say zero.
- Never
- We'd rather not have them. I think
- None.
- Zero.
No nuclear weapons.
Zero.
- Zero.
- Zero.
No country should have them.
The ultimate number is none.
Ideally will be zero
- Zero nuclear weapons.
- Zero. Zero.
We have taken important steps forward </ i>
 to increase nuclear security</ i>
 and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. </ i>
 This starts with the reduction </ i>
 of our own nuclear arsenals. </ i>
This legally binding treaty  will be completed this year. </ i>
The arms control agreements we negotiated between the United States and the Soviet Union ...
You think these were independent initiatives taken by governments, but the fact is that public opinion had a big role to play in the process
- President Kennedy,
After he passed the limited test ban treaty and whenever he mentioned it on the stump afterwards he got thunderous applause.
And he quote:
"If I had known that it was so popular,
"I would have done it a long time ago. "
The elimination of nuclear weapons has not yet been agreed to by political leaders of the world.
It's a revolutionary idea, but they can be eliminated.
We have to change our way of thinking.
And if we cant change our way of thinking, we wont survive.
Its that simple
I have changed my way of thinking and millions and millions of other people are changing their thinking
And, frankly, if you have never changed your mind about something,
I .. pinch yourself
You maybe dead.
{1238}{1319}Let me do your legs.
{1866}{1948}There we go.
{2020}{2091}{Y:i}Here....
{2340}{2464}For almost 51 years|I've washed this back.
{2591}{2655}That's good.
{2722}{2807}Do you want to stay behind,|I'm going?
{3877}{4015}Steam of Life
{5735}{5832}One thing I've noticed, boys,|about love -
{5835}{5928}and what women like,|that's massage.
{5931}{6067}Neck, shoulders, legs|and buttocks, every day.
{6070}{6166}That's our love story right there.
{6169}{6323}If I skip one part and|try and sneak off, -
{6326}{6400}{Y:i}she will say:|"You missed the legs.''
{6403}{6517}{Y:i}Or if I think she's asleep, no:|"You missed the legs.''
{6520}{6637}Women are very particular|about the spots they want massaged.
{6640}{6769}I think they call them G-spots,|or what do they call them.
{7173}{7277}That's him.|- Well, then.
{7280}{7376}They all look alike.|- Them babies.
{7379}{7469}He's smiling.|- Right.
{7472}{7578}So adorable.|- Looks like his father.
{7581}{7709}He's so small and weak, it's great|to care for someone so small -
{7712}{7829}and see him growing every day.|- That's right.
{7832}{7961}I'll always remember the moment|they lifted him to his mother's arms -
{7964}{8065}and I cut the umbilical cord...
{8068}{8232}And I saw the baby,|his little hands and feet...
{8235}{8362}They're home now|and I was on a paternal leave -
{8365}{8413}helping to|take care of the baby.
{8416}{8549}Now one dream has come true -
{8552}{8674}and maybe God will give us|a little princess later.
{8677}{8736}That's right.
{9844}{9954}{Y:i}It's nice to go to sauna....|- Damn, are you going to sauna?
{9957}{10052}You were supposed to eat first!
{10055}{10162}Come on now!|- I won't throw this to the stoves.
{10165}{10273}{Y:i}Fucking hell, you go to sauna...|- What's the soup you made?
{10276}{10329}Cabbage soup!
{11212}{11317}Really insane stories,|the things I've told you -
{11320}{11396}things you can experience|in your childhood.
{11399}{11555}Things like hidden family violence...
{11558}{11713}When you have a stepfather|and you feel like you're in the way...
{11716}{11840}I first realized this|when I started school.
{11843}{11936}We were at the cottage,|he took me to this big rock -
{11939}{12015}where the kids always play...
{12018}{12135}He told me that I'm not Kuosmanen,|I'm Putkonen.
{12138}{12229}{Y:i}I was seven then,|I didn't quite get it.
{12232}{12310}I thought of him as my father.
{12358}{12528}If you think of it,|nowadays it would be uneard of...
{12531}{12651}When I got home from school,|I tried to avoid him -
{12654}{12784}and tried to look and see|if the despot is home.
{12787}{12969}You grow numb with it,|always being beaten, hit or strangled.
{12972}{13126}The most insane thing was|to be pushed down to the floor -
{13129}{13246}and a pillow was held over my face.
{13249}{13371}And the hypocrisy,|what was shown to others...
{13374}{13470}All was well|in the artist family.
{13473}{13594}And the way it stopped for me...
{13597}{13717}I was drunk for the first time -
{13720}{13862}and came home,|we had this French balcony...
{13865}{13951}I grabbed the guy,|he was a head shorter -
{13954}{14042}and I was sporty|and well-built...
{14045}{14180}I had the upper hand,|I might have dropped him from there.
{14183}{14276}{Y:i}He was screaming for mercy|"Don't kill me! Help!".
{14279}{14337}And that was the end of it.
{14487}{14566}There's one more round here.
{15045}{15183}In '89, I had everything|I had always wanted.
{15186}{15286}I had a daughter,|I had a good job -
{15289}{15362}but the child had no mother.
{15365}{15528}I was a construction worker,|and my mother cared for my daughter.
{15531}{15641}She started staying over there,|I visited them often.
{15644}{15782}Then this person told me I can't come,|because the girl always cries after that.
{15785}{15873}Was your mother alone|or with someone?
{15876}{15987}My mother is married.
{15990}{16085}They adopted my daughter.
{16088}{16178}My daughter is also|my stepsister.
{16223}{16334}That's why I'm up here in the North.|I just get so sad there.
{16387}{16479}{Y:i}I didn't get info about her schooling|or anything, really, -
{16482}{16544}I had to threaten with lawyers.
{16547}{16659}We tried to negotiate,|but they accused and pressured me.
{16662}{16837}I lost it totally then.|I've always been a crackerjack.
{16840}{17007}I told them to draw up the papers,|I will sign them, whatever you want.
{17010}{17117}That's...
{17120}{17223}That's how we dealt with it.
{17441}{17505}Fuck, it still hurts.
{17812}{17858}More steam.
{18048}{18164}If only I could tell my daughter,|but I can't.
{18623}{18707}It's good that I can tell you.
{19235}{19311}Is it cold?|- Not warm yet.
{19314}{19473}The sun doesn't warm much.|Should have a black tub there.
{19535}{19589}You want a beer?|- Sure.
{20112}{20204}It would be nice|if she came for a visit.
{20426}{20546}We could cry together.|I'm always crying alone.
{20594}{20722}{Y:i}Would be good for her to know....|- Yes, to know the reasons behind it.
{22067}{22221}In 1983, my life|got totally out of hand.
{22224}{22288}I lost my grasp of things.
{22291}{22354}I drank and got into crime.
{22357}{22491}In the summer of '84,|I committed a robbery -
{22494}{22596}and got one year for it.
{22599}{22745}I drank and drank,|that was my life.
{22748}{22813}I went into prison that summer, -
{22816}{22979}and that started a spiral|that lasted until '93.
{23163}{23296}Once I was crossing the street, -
{23299}{23374}I was high on drugs,|drunk or something, -
{23377}{23498}and I realized this is a part|of the plan that destroys me.
{23550}{23674}Then I got an 18-month sentence...
{23677}{23794}I lived alone in my cell,|they do in Sweden.
{23797}{23983}In the corner, there was|a piece of metal sheet -
{23986}{24070}that served as a mirror there.
{24073}{24140}I remember looking into it -
{24143}{24245}and thinking that I'll kill myself|to end all this shit.
{24248}{24367}I had this lady friend|who visited me from Stockholm.
{24370}{24486}She came to the prison|in March and asked:
{24489}{24604}{Y:i}"Pertti, what happened to your eyes,|they're the eyes of a dead fish.''
{24842}{24935}One prisoner tried to escape -
{24938}{25045}by splitting his gums|with a razor blade.
{25048}{25178}I had taken amphetamine one night|and just decided to escape.
{25181}{25358}I started working out,|so I broke into sweat -
{25361}{25446}{Y:i}and then called the guard:|"I've got stomach cramps.''
{25449}{25611}I took a razor blade|and made wounds into my mouth -
{25614}{25706}and let the blood run into a cup -
{25709}{25802}and spread it all over the place|and lay down on the floor.
{25805}{25939}That's how they found me,|unconscious.
{25942}{26103}They hooked me up to an IV,|I started running towards the door.
{26106}{26273}The guards caught me,|called the police and handcuffed me.
{26276}{26438}The warden put me into solitary,|I was a danger to others.
{26578}{26790}In the solitary, I was permitted|to sit outside on my lunch hour.
{26793}{26915}It was a beautiful day,|I sat against a trash can.
{26918}{26998}I wore shorts, had a cup of coffee|and the sky was blue.
{27001}{27116}All of a sudden, I saw|a blue butterfly in the sky.
{27119}{27209}I thought it was beautiful,|hoped it would sit on my mug.
{27212}{27329}The mug was blue|and had painted grass and flowers.
{27332}{27385}It was like summer.
{27388}{27451}So the butterfly landed|on my mug.
{27454}{27554}I hoped it would open its wings,|and so it did.
{27557}{27634}And at that moment,|something happened.
{27637}{27749}Instantly,|my broken view of the world -
{27752}{27866}was totally cleared.
{28075}{28190}At the end of February 1991,|I got out of prison in Sweden.
{28252}{28366}When I walked into the log temple, -
{28369}{28439}I had this insight that the woman|who sits next to me will be my wife.
{28442}{28571}And so this Anu Katja Johanna|sat next to me during the introduction.
{28574}{28665}I fell in love with her woolly socks.
{28668}{28814}She curled her toes|inside the red-and-white striped socks.
{28817}{28922}I looked at her and|my heart went all weak.
{28952}{29134}Once I came back from a run|and near the course center I thought -
{29137}{29219}that if Anu is at the front door,|I will tell her this.
{29222}{29312}I went there,|and she opened the door!
{29315}{29397}{Y:i}I told her:|"We will be married.''
{29457}{29536}When I was young,|I told my mother:
{29539}{29701}{Y:i}"I want a wife from Kainuu,|she is a brown-eyed nurse.''
{29704}{29812}And my wife has brown eyes|and is a nurse.
{29943}{30097}When Anu took the pregnancy test|and then she called the lab -
{30100}{30249}and she heard|that the hormone levels were up -
{30252}{30381}it was just such miracle!|That I would be a father!
{30384}{30473}After such a life!
{30661}{30833}This kind of basic life,|organized society -
{30836}{30929}this is the best I know.
{30932}{31019}I've always had|empty pockets.
{31022}{31108}Now I have my family|and empty pockets.
{35408}{35480}I got married during the war -
{35483}{35588}and had two children|when I was on leave.
{35591}{35719}But then my wife got sick.
{35771}{35958}When she was still alive,|if I was away for a few hours -
{35961}{36095}I always worried|if I would find her dead or alive.
{36098}{36274}I couldn't always get|the boys to watch her.
{36277}{36418}My eldest son was there|a few times and asked me:
{36421}{36534}"How can you cope with this life|for so many years, Dad?"
{36559}{36631}But I just had to carry on, -
{36634}{36787}and you get the strength for it|as you go along.
{36907}{37054}It went on for five years|before she finally died.
{37057}{37133}Then I was alone.
{37158}{37262}I sat home alone|on my bed -
{37265}{37414}and cooked whenever I wanted,|what little I wanted alone...
{37417}{37560}Suddenly I had this hunger|for other people.
{37563}{37749}I said myself that something|has to change in my life.
{37752}{37869}{Y:i}My son came to visit and said:|"Listen, Dad.''
{37872}{38071}"We have to do something,|you have to get out and about" -
{38074}{38177}"or else you will go crazy."
{38180}{38335}After my son told me that,|I got my act together -
{38338}{38418}and went to|the Veterans' Christmas Party.
{38421}{38520}I found a nice-looking person there, -
{38523}{38647}I thought she would be nice company|if only I would dare to ask.
{38650}{38757}I finally approached her -
{38760}{38835}and asked if I could one day|come for a cup of coffee.
{38838}{39034}She said yes, and soon enough|I went there with a bunch of flowers.
{39037}{39127}That's how it started|and it still goes on -
{39130}{39190}hopefully for a long time.
{39193}{39316}We've had great companionship|and a good life.
{39319}{39399}She's a good person|and can cook -
{39402}{39534}and tells me how to do laundry|and helps me in everything.
{39537}{39626}I'm living the best years of my life.
{39629}{39708}Well, her neighbors|must have been wondering -
{39711}{39811}when they saw another pair of|underpants on the washing line -
{39814}{39870}as she doesn't|have a husband.
{39909}{40031}How long have you been together?|- For 18 years now.
{40034}{40178}Both getting older at the same time.|- Older and senile.
{40594}{40760}The police brought him here|one night in the spring.
{40763}{40943}They called and asked if there's room|for one more orphan.
{40946}{41032}I said there's always room|for one more.
{41035}{41146}That's how our friendship started.
{41208}{41315}We went berry picking|and fishing with him.
{41318}{41452}At first, we should have picked|the berries for him.
{41455}{41612}At one point,|there was a bush full of blueberries -
{41615}{41785}so I took some branches|and told him to sit down -
{41788}{41955}so that I could teach him|how to pick blueberries.
{41958}{42049}When we had caught fish -
{42052}{42167}we had to negotiate|how to share the catch.
{42170}{42390}He was going to take all fish.|I wouldn't let him.
{42393}{42557}"I will take these|and you will take those."
{42591}{42729}Breaking things is important to him.
{42732}{42908}If you give him a car tire,|he will tear it apart in a second.
{43030}{43164}One Saturday,|we went to the sauna.
{43167}{43295}He stayed to eat|out in the barn.
{43298}{43409}We sat in the sauna for a while...
{43412}{43519}The doors started banging -
{43522}{43603}and he barged in|from underneath the door -
{43606}{43705}and came to the benches.
{43708}{43815}I told him I will throw some water|on the stove to get some steam.
{43867}{44083}As soon as the steam hissed|he barged out underneath the door.
{44086}{44295}I told him: "No, no don't go yet,|you haven't broken into sweat yet."
{44298}{44382}But no, he went outside,|banging the doors.
{45205}{45257}Right, Juuso.
{45260}{45380}You were only a boy|when we had our sauna.
{45383}{45467}A very little boy...
{45470}{45580}Left without washing, did you?
{45583}{45671}{Y:i}Yes, that's right.
{45855}{45974}The bear has become|a real friend to me.
{45977}{46108}It's an intelligent animal,|learns very fast.
{46111}{46238}And it is a true,|loyal friend indeed.
{46354}{46504}Right, another one gone.|This is the name of the game.
{46666}{46761}{Y:i}Juuso! It's broken now!
{50844}{50956}I keep going back|to early spring...
{50959}{51042}We still had snow.
{51045}{51181}There was a spring happening|for children on the lake ice.
{51184}{51347}I was playing|with my daughter, -
{51350}{51465}sledding down the hill,|eating grilled sausages.
{51468}{51603}She went on a pony ride.|Think what an experience for a child!
{51662}{51745}Every time I went to get her,|she ran to me with her arms open:
{51748}{51848}"Daddy, I want to go home with you!|I miss you so much."
{51851}{52009}{Y:i}I have two cats, she says:|"To see Mikku and Okku at home! ''
{52184}{52249}It's so wrong.|- Well, it tears you apart.
{52252}{52447}Think about it: You don't see your|child for example for 13 years!
{52450}{52493}How long has it been now?
{52535}{52615}Well, how long has it been...
{52656}{52753}I had just received|the Appellate Court order -
{52756}{52827}with all the visiting rights.
{52830}{52965}{Y:i}Not as extensive|as I had wanted...
{52968}{53036}As soon as|the court process was over -
{53039}{53179}and the decision was,|like 9 times out of 10 -
{53182}{53252}that the custody was taken|from the father.
{53255}{53373}Every other weekend|and one weekday, that's it.
{53376}{53441}Nothing else mattered.
{53444}{53570}As soon as the process was over,|the mother refused to give the child.
{53624}{53743}We were visiting grandma|for the last time with the girl, -
{53746}{53802}we played together -
{53805}{53933}when my ex just announced that|she won't allow visitations anymore.
{53936}{54062}This is now September,|I haven't seen or heard of her.
{54065}{54158}I don't even know|if they live here any more.
{54216}{54312}{Y:i}The authorities can't do anything|without court orders.
{54367}{54542}I should go to court and get an order|forcing her to let me see the child.
{54630}{54761}And of course,|family and friends miss her also.
{54764}{54925}Her godfather, grandmother|and everyone else.
{54928}{55079}They keep asking about her|and crying...
{55082}{55138}Her grandmother is getting old, -
{55141}{55302}she cried|if she will ever see Inka again.
{55305}{55420}I told her I don't know the answer.
{55566}{55696}I don't mind suffering,|but my girl is so young...
{55741}{55806}She's not yet three, -
{55809}{55899}she doesn't have|long-term memory yet.
{55902}{56028}I think my daughter doesn't remember|who her father is any more.
{56080}{56157}That really hurts.
{56382}{56452}If only I could hold her.
{56455}{56588}If she would run towards me|and jump into my arms.
{56591}{56675}"Let's go home|and see 0kku and Mikka."
{58853}{58991}I remember my grandpa,|when I was a little boy.
{58994}{59170}I used to walk to their place|and he'd be chopping wood.
{59173}{59323}Grandma was inside,|cooking, doing chores.
{59326}{59501}When grandma was in a bad mood,|grandpa would stop us -
{59504}{59600}and ask us:|"Is it still stormy in the South?"
{59603}{59729}He meant:|"Is your grandmother still angry?"
{59848}{60052}I asked grandpa how old|the oldest logs were in the shed.
{60055}{60166}{Y:i}He thought about it|and then said: "11 years.''
{60191}{60314}Time passed.|Grandpa chopped wood -
{60317}{60436}and grandma was either|in a good or a bad mood.
{60550}{60681}Then grandpa got dementia|and had to go to a nursing home.
{60684}{60920}When we visited him,|we told him everyday news -
{60923}{61040}but he wasn't interested.
{61043}{61301}When we spent quiet time with him,|he would then ask -
{61304}{61411}where the end of the wood pile was, -
{61414}{61482}had it reached|the wall on the river side?
{61565}{61821}After four years grandpa found out|that his woodpile was running low.
{61824}{61922}He cried and apologized -
{61923}{62021}for not having chopped enough wood.
{62082}{62138}Afterwards, when I've thought about it, -
{62139}{62195}I realized -
{62198}{62263}that he wanted to chop enough wood -
{62266}{62490}{Y:i}to last until the end of grandmother's life.
{62493}{62582}That's when I realized -
{62583}{62673}how manifold love can be.
{63077}{63150}Pete, the oars are squeaking.
{63184}{63352}I do love boats.|- That's right.
{63405}{63508}{Y:i}When the Frog went a-courting|Aha, Aha...
{63511}{63552}There's only one aha.
{63622}{63738}But where is he going?|- I'm going to Bulgaria.
{63741}{63843}What else will we take?
{63846}{63972}Sunscreen.|- Sunscreen, we have to take it.
{63975}{64081}If I forget it, what will we do?|I burn easily.
{64084}{64169}Then we put yogurt|on your back.
{64172}{64264}What other clothes shall we take?
{64267}{64354}The bikini.|- What bikini?
{64406}{64489}You know.
{64504}{64597}The plane flies high up.|- In the sky.
{64600}{64695}{Y:i}Where's the sky?
{66022}{66074}It's getting cloudy.
{66077}{66160}What?|- Getting cloudy.
{66411}{66482}You should be honest with others.
{66801}{66882}Have you been the best friend?
{66885}{66967}I have been for a long time,|already as a child.
{66970}{67122}So have I.|- I've been honest to everyone.
{67125}{67224}I've never stolen anything.|You have to ask always.
{67227}{67367}You have to be honest.
{67370}{67496}My best friend.|I'm the best friend.
{67552}{67711}All's well and in balance.|- All's in order.
{70645}{70743}Interesting, this is somehow mild.|- Yes, mild.
{70746}{70854}It has a lot of soul.|Touch of leather.
{70857}{70952}Light as the touch|of a summer fairy.
{70955}{71052}The touch of a summer virgin.
{71055}{71143}Right after swimming in the sea.
{71341}{71472}I've been to all army saunas|there possibly are -
{71475}{71571}from a battalion sauna|to a one-man tent sauna, -
{71574}{71666}and in Afghanistan,|in a Swedish sauna -
{71669}{71804}which differs from a Stockholm sauna|in that the newspaper is 2 weeks late.
{72431}{72512}How have you recovered|from getting back from the tour?
{72515}{72637}I had to work a few weeks -
{72640}{72758}to get myself back|into the regiment books.
{72761}{72837}I tried to adapt to being back home.
{72840}{72963}Some bad things happened|to me during that year away.
{72966}{73083}My mother died|and my relationship fell apart.
{73086}{73199}And you can't really|process those things out there, -
{73202}{73328}you have to concentrate|on the task at hand.
{73331}{73417}And you know,|I work out a lot.
{73420}{73560}I poured all that anxiety|and bad feelings into workouts.
{73634}{73727}What was it like when the Chaplain|brought the message?
{73730}{73800}If I remember correctly, -
{73803}{73979}my then girlfriend just called me|on my mobile -
{73982}{74106}and told me to sit down,|she had bad news.
{74109}{74197}Well, that was that.
{74200}{74375}{Y:i}The Chief-of-Staff and the Chaplain|met me on the club house....
{74378}{74481}The Chief immediately|started arranging -
{74484}{74596}for me to be on the next flight home -
{74599}{74673}so that I can go bury my mother.
{74676}{74900}Me and Jari Rankinen went to the chapel|to have a...
{75004}{75065}Take a moment.|- Yes.
{75068}{75239}We lit a candle|and read a passage from the Bible.
{75346}{75443}I could have hardened myself,|as I did before -
{75446}{75518}and claim that I didn't feel anything.
{75521}{75657}But now that I actually felt something,|it was easier to bear it.
{75660}{75829}In a military organization,|showing softness and weakness -
{75832}{75993}is not necessarily a strength.|You can be soft and weak in private.
{75996}{76083}{Y:i}You can't show it there.|- No, you can't.
{76086}{76197}And Finnish men|have traditionally been very tough.
{76382}{76518}I haven't regretted joining the army.|It has saved me.
{76521}{76623}I can't say a bad word.
{76626}{76755}The man and the job|belong together, in this case.
{76758}{76833}Will your son continue|in your footsteps?
{76836}{76974}Well... I'm happy to say he listens|to Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin.
{76977}{77096}Last week he cut his long hair,|so no more moshing.
{77099}{77183}But the signs are good.|- Yes.
{77186}{77293}{Y:i}His own words, said with a smile:|"Join the army? Seriously! ''
{77296}{77403}He has been|watching me and Jari -
{77406}{77494}and thought|how ridiculous it is.
{77497}{77588}But we do it with a big heart.
{77591}{77705}Whatever my son decides,|if he does it from his heart...
{77708}{77786}If he decides that he won't|do the military service -
{77789}{77901}and it comes from his heart,|I will totally stand by him.
{78446}{78495}Happy Independence Day.
{78993}{79109}When they ask children|to sing to Santa, -
{79112}{79198}{Y:i}then you feel like saying:|"Let's just get to the presents.''
{79294}{79419}Today there was one family|where nobody wanted to sing.
{79422}{79558}Then I wanted to hand out the presents,|but no, the lady didn't want that.
{79561}{79738}But you don't want to leave|after five minutes either.
{79741}{79915}You don't earn your money.|- All the homes had kids in there.
{80128}{80235}Have you noticed|that when Santa comes in, -
{80238}{80351}they offer you the best chair|or a place on the sofa.
{80354}{80454}But I have one family,|I won't mention names -
{80457}{80598}{Y:i}where Santa gets a servant's chair,|and it's halfway in the doorway.
{80601}{80666}A bit like taking some distance.
{80669}{80822}They're so far away|I feel like shouting or taking a mic.
{80825}{80984}Today I had a place|where they left me on the doorstep!
{80987}{81119}They cleared some space there,|but it really annoyed me -
{81122}{81229}I couldn't even get in,|had to shout from the door.
{81232}{81360}And usually Santa|is the guest of honor.
{82819}{82942}You know the Suzuki four-wheel drive?|- Yes, I know.
{82945}{83024}How many people does it seat?
{83027}{83118}Well, it takes in...
{83121}{83200}About a dozen people.
{83220}{83380}Well, we were 21 in there.|Driving in there.
{83383}{83506}Who drove it? How come?|- The owner.
{83509}{83670}It must have been a tight squeeze.|- You bet.
{83673}{83836}The only ones|that are still alive -
{83839}{84022}are me|and the owner of the car...
{84025}{84131}All the others|have kicked the bucket.
{84134}{84213}Like my wife last summer.
{84290}{84378}They first knocked on the door|before six a.m.
{84381}{84517}{Y:i}Then they rang the doorbell.|I said: ''Leena, where are you?"
{84520}{84620}"Who's at the door now?"|But there was nobody there.
{84623}{84748}When I opened the door,|it was two policemen.
{84751}{84909}They asked if I was so and so,|I said yes. They had a message.
{84912}{85108}{Y:i}They said it was about my wife,|or that do you know so and so....
{85111}{85192}I said yes, she's my wife.
{85195}{85307}They said:|"These are her rings and belongings."
{85310}{85465}{Y:i}"Our divers have just found her,|she drowned in the sea.''
{85796}{85875}She's in Hietaniemi,|at the cemetery.
{85878}{85930}She had a good funeral.
{86035}{86142}I have to take it one day at a time.
{86296}{86364}She was everything to me.
{86809}{86856}I want to break a sweat.
{87190}{87280}OK, go ahead.
{87283}{87421}Are you going to barbecue me?|- That's what I planned.
{87657}{87752}So where to now?
{87826}{87907}Downtown?
{87953}{88137}I've been on the Esplanade,|50 cents for a flat.
{88140}{88265}Oh yes.|It has all the modern conveniences.
{88268}{88376}No, I have a sleeping bag.|- I see.
{88379}{88488}But how do you fit in there?|- Into the toilet?
{88491}{88582}It's not that big.|- The big one.
{88585}{88682}I see, the big one.|- It costs 50 cents per night.
{88685}{88783}Per day. So you recommend?
{88786}{88876}Indoor plumbing and everything.
{90827}{90968}So you decided to come here?|- It was in the early 90's.
{90974}{91070}Matti asked me|to come and pan for gold.
{91109}{91227}I had no ties in the South,|so I stayed here.
{91244}{91414}I had nothing|to go back to there.
{91486}{91588}Bit like me, the same thing.|- Yes, that's right.
{91605}{91691}A bit similar, yes.
{91751}{91816}And it's good up here.
{91900}{92080}It's about two years ago|when I met my present wife.
{92101}{92251}And it's been going well.|- My age protects me from that.
{92254}{92397}Yes, your age helps,|protects you from women.
{92401}{92513}Well, not too much.|- I see.
{92545}{92616}They come and hug me.
{92839}{92996}One time at a work trip,|something bad happened.
{93117}{93268}They didn't warn us|about men working on the tracks.
{93294}{93461}We were taking a plaster train|to 膋鋝lompolo.
{93553}{93651}To the cement factory.|- I see.
{93701}{93887}There was this guy,|standing on a small bridge.
{93895}{93964}He was waving a red flag!
{93968}{94066}I acknowledged it|and braked as hard as I could.
{94069}{94169}He started running|in front of the train.
{94316}{94383}Splash, splash.
{94401}{94544}{Y:i}He didn't get out in time?|- No. He tried to save his friend.
{94546}{94605}I see.
{94714}{94791}I still have nightmares about it.
{94793}{94948}It was only about 10 cars away.|The boys were under the cars.
{95001}{95144}But their death was...|- Instantaneous.
{95202}{95344}No suffering,|not lying in the hospital for long.
{95503}{95666}{Y:i}Later, I met one's sister|and the other one's wife....
{95930}{96036}Shouldrt have said|anything about this.
{96107}{96197}Sometimes it's good to talk.
{98692}{98752}I don't know if you noticed, -
{98756}{98850}but for years, it was hard to see|other families with twins.
{98853}{98948}{Y:i}Yes, I noticed,|we didn't have much contact then.
{98972}{99038}Understandable, in a way.
{99113}{99221}{Y:i}You can't wish this|on anyone else.
{99248}{99342}That one of the twins|is dead.
{99376}{99521}When I saw other twin families,|I became so jealous.
{99536}{99698}And I couldn't accept my own feelings.|That was very hard.
{99701}{99882}{Y:i}And even today, I don't want|to look at baby twins in prams.
{99915}{100041}But it has changed with time.
{100160}{100265}It's a bit corny,|two years and two months...
{100277}{100402}I'm not a superstitious person -
{100412}{100550}but I keep thinking|that lida was a twin, -
{100556}{100643}and we got our second child|on our second try -
{100651}{100743}as there was a miscarriage first...
{100756}{100909}And then the second child dies|when she's 2 years and 2 months.
{100922}{101035}Feels like the figure 2|is all used up in our family.
{101514}{101582}I had just commented|the previous night -
{101583}{101647}that we are given|as much as we can take.
{101649}{101701}And boy did we get some.
{101710}{101768}That was a normal Thursday, -
{101771}{101883}I had a coffee meeting|for entrepreneurs in the morning.
{101900}{102010}I left, Minna and the kids woke up,|it was summer holiday.
{102029}{102112}The meeting took a few hours.
{102166}{102230}I went out to my car -
{102232}{102304}and listened to my messages.
{102305}{102351}I was a bit surprised -
{102353}{102445}at how many messages I had.
{102476}{102562}{Y:i}It was the third message....
{102600}{102653}A womars voice said:
{102702}{102741}"It's the answering service."
{102742}{102780}"Shall we leave a message?"
{102782}{102840}Another woman says: "Yes."
{102849}{102937}A woman is crying in the background.
{102957}{103007}The message said then:
{103009}{103118}"Please call the health center."
{103280}{103390}My first thought was:
{103414}{103465}{Y:i}"Now it's happening."
{103467}{103521}A strange relief...
{103523}{103598}I don't have to be afraid any more.
{103703}{103773}I called the number.
{103825}{103862}I told who I am, -
{103864}{103919}and they put the call through.
{103922}{103993}And Minna answered.
{104006}{104079}Then I knew Minna is OK.
{104081}{104168}I asked which one or all of them.
{104187}{104264}Minna said it was lida.
{104287}{104355}She told me what happened.
{104383}{104455}I started the car,|my hands were shaking.
{104457}{104557}I thought I'll never get there.
{104560}{104648}During that drive,|I only had three thoughts.
{104655}{104717}That she's there, happy and smiling, -
{104722}{104775}thinking how she scared us.
{104787}{104824}The second one was -
{104828}{104877}that she was a vegetable.
{104883}{104952}I realized that if you don't breathe, -
{104957}{105027}the brain damage is immediate.
{105078}{105158}And the third one was: She's dead.
{105171}{105247}The mood went from happy to sad.
{105250}{105303}And then I just screamed.
{105323}{105412}I got to the health care center.
{105417}{105476}Minna is walking towards me.
{105500}{105560}She says that lida is dead.
{105726}{105765}There was bench -
{105770}{105850}and we sat down and cried.
{105891}{105986}Minna asked if I wanted to see lida.
{106010}{106061}Afterwards I realized -
{106067}{106161}{Y:i}I didn't want it at that moment.
{106188}{106313}When we go inside and get to lida...
{106342}{106438}It's strange, a dead child...
{106442}{106513}Does not look like herself at all.
{106542}{106613}I felt like...
{106627}{106675}That when the soul has left -
{106681}{106757}the body looks different.
{106763}{106834}She didn't look like lida.
{106955}{107080}Then they told us after a while|that we should go home -
{107116}{107212}and the child should be taken|to the morgue.
{107225}{107276}We walked her there.
{107279}{107381}There were piles of laundry|along the corridors.
{107389}{107512}There was a little lounge|and we left lida there.
{107515}{107582}I couldn't bear watching it.
{107585}{107712}That they will put the child|into a dark, cold room.
{107716}{107778}An unbearable thought.
{107781}{107977}We went to see lida a few times|at the health center morgue -
{107984}{108088}before she was taken|to Tampere for autopsy.
{108109}{108153}I could never go in there, -
{108156}{108288}I had to ask the staff|to take lida out.
{108291}{108431}The thought of darkness and cold|was just unbearable.
{108433}{108505}She always liked warmth.
{109077}{109202}I always thought that life is ruled|with rationale and theories -
{109205}{109309}and intellect and head.|I've been a real robot, machine head.
{109312}{109403}Then you lose your child,|and there is no reason, -
{109407}{109563}it's all pure emotion.|How can you deal with that rationally?
{109602}{109668}Very contradictory emotions, -
{109671}{109856}like when Minna, Roosa and Essi|were there and lida died.
{109863}{109966}That raises|mixed emotions.
{109979}{110050}I was angry at myself|for not being there, -
{110053}{110141}a man should protect his family.
{110149}{110235}I let down my family.
{110238}{110364}On the other hand, I was jealous|to Minna for being there.
{110368}{110469}I've talked to other fathers|whose children have died -
{110474}{110659}about what we have learned|as children about coping with this.
{110679}{110805}What are the options for boys?
{110814}{110913}Being silent and drinking.|"Boys don't cry."
{110963}{111062}When you think of the situation,|it's no wonder -
{111066}{111172}that you don't know how to act|when you're next to your dead child.
{111179}{111302}You try to look for a norm|that isn't there.
{111325}{111397}Later, you realize...
{111409}{111571}I was just looking for a way to act,|a way to continue my life.
{111590}{111712}I had this surreal thought|that if I'm ever in this situation again -
{111718}{111836}I would want to scream.|Just scream everything out.
{111907}{112053}When I was younger, I thought|you should manage everything alone.
{112108}{112176}I don't need help,|I don't need sympathy.
{112179}{112288}I'm fed up with it,|I don't want to be alone.
{112294}{112373}I want to share things.
{112432}{112584}Only now I understood that|solitude is the worst thing.
{112632}{112802}Only knowing you are not alone|is an incredible relief.
{113054}{113252}{Y:i}Sweetly the squirrel baby|Sleeps on her mossy bed
{113257}{113467}{Y:i}Never reached by hounds|Nor snared by hunters
{113470}{113635}{Y:i}Safe in her nest
{113719}{113994}{Y:i}From her cocoon high up|She looks upon the world
{113997}{114261}{Y:i}After seeing so many fights|The peace flag of her home tree
{114264}{114414}{Y:i}Is flying over her head
{114727}{114992}{Y:i}Oh to live happily|In the swinging cradle up so high
{114995}{115274}{Y:i}Squirrel nesting forever|In the gentle arms of the tree
{115277}{115395}{Y:i}Hear the song of the woods
{115999}{116253}{Y:i}That's where the furry cutie|Is sleeping on her window
{116256}{116562}{Y:i}Birds on the skies|Are singing lullabies
{116565}{116683}{Y:i}Taking her to|The sweet land of dreams

I open the Congress of the Sixth Party Day... in respectful public memory of...
General Field Marshal and Reich President Von Hindenburg... who has passed into Eternity.
The General Field Marshal is remembered as the first soldier of the Great War.
And thoughts as well to our fallen comrades.

In sincere friendship the greeting of the Movement is extended... especially to the representatives of the Armed Forces here, now under the orders of the Führer!
My Leader:
Around you stand the flags and standards of this National Socialism.
Only when they are threadbare... will the people be able to understand... by hindsight, the greatness of our time... because ofwhat you, my Leader, mean to Germany!
You are Germany!
When you act, the Nation acts.
When you judge, the People judge.
Our thanks is the vow to stand with you... in good days and bad... come whatmay.!

Thanks to your leadership, Germany will be attainable as the homeland.
Homeland for all Germans in the world.

>From the proclamation of the Führer read by Wagner
Adolf Wagner, GauleiterofMunich-Upper
BavariaAdolfBavarian InteriorMinister
&SA-Obergruppenführer
No revolution that seems to be permanent... can lead to anything other than complete anarchy.
So the World will not live at war.
So also the people do not live on revolution.
Nothing on this earth that has lasted for thousands ofyears... was assembled in mere decades.
The largest tree also has the longest period of growth.
What braves the centuries... will also be strong through the centuries.
AlfredRosenberg, Reichsleiter andlaterReich Minister forannexedEastern Territories
It is our unshakeable belief in ourselves... that is our hope for the youth... to carry on the work which has been put before them in the stormyyears... of the revolt of 1 91 8 in Munich... and which is already part of the entire German nation's history.
Dr. Otto Dietrich, Reichsleiter andReich Press Chiefin Ministry ofPeople EnlightenmentandPropaganda
Truth is the foundation... on which the power of the press stands in the world.
And that it reports the truth about Germany... is the only demand that we place on the foreign press.
DrFritz Todt, Reich GeneralInspector ofHighwaysandConstruction andMinisterofArmamentsandMunitions
As I speak, work on the Reich Autobahn has begun at 51 locations.
Although this work is in its early stage... today there are already
52,000 men on thejob... and another 1 00,000... engaged in the work of allied industries.
Fritz Reinhardt, State Secretary in the Reich MinistryofFinance andSA Obergruppenführer
Wherever we look, all around there is building... and new creations... and activity and life... which will continue into the future.

A people that does not protect the purity of its race, goes to seed!
Dr. Robert Ley, Reichsleiter andHeadofthe German LaborFront
All our work must be dictated by a single thought-- that the German worker... be made an upright, proud and equally entitled national comrade.
Dr. Hans Frank,
Reichs MinisterofJustice andlater
GovernorGeneralofoccupiedPoland
As the Leader of the German legal service...
I can say that, clearly, the basis of the National Socialist State... is the Nationalist Socialist Law Code.
And forus ourhighestleader isalso the highestjudge.!
We know how sacred the principles of these laws are to our Führer.
These Reich laws can assure you,
National Comrades... that your life and existence is safe in this National Socialist State of Order, Freedom and Law.
Dr.JosefGoebbels, Reich Minister ofPeople EnlightenmentandPropaganda,
GauleiterofBerlin... andlater
GeneralPlenipotentiaryfor Total War
May the bright flame of our enthusiasm never be extinguished.
It alone gives light and warmth... to the creative art of modern political propaganda.
This comes from the depths of the People... and from these depths of the people... it must always again find its roots and its strength.
It may be good to possess power based on strength... but it is better to win and hold the heart of a People.
Konstantin Hierl, Reichsarbeitsführer,
Headofthe German LaborService
Today, the German people are spiritually and soulfully ready... to undertake their obligation in the general Labor Service.
We have the Führer's orders!

Germany.!
Today we work together... in the swamp.
We work in the swamp.
And in the sand.
We dam the North Sea.
We plant trees.
We build roads... from town to town, and city to city.
We provide the farmer with new soil... forests and fields, land and bread... forGermany.
We didn't stand in the trenches.
Nor were we under the shell fire of grenades... and still we are soldiers.
Sharpen the hammers... axes, pickaxes andspades.!
We are the Reich 'syoungmanhood.!
As once at Langemarck... at Tannenberg... before Lüttich (Liege)... before Verdun... on the Somme... on the Ähne... in Flanders... in the West... in the East... in the South... on land, on water, and in the clouds.
Comrades, who were shot by the Red Front and Reactionaries...
You are not dead.!
You live in Germany.!
My Labor Service Men.
For the first time you are presented for review in this forum... before me and before the German people.
You represent a great idea... and we know that for millions of our national comrades... physical labor will not longer be a divisive concept.
But it will instead bind us together and, furthermore... no longer will it be the case in Germany... that physical labor will be seen as anything less... than any other work.
The whole nation passes through your school.
The time will come when no German... can be admitted into the community of the people... until he has first become a member ofyour group.
And you know that today you are not only being seen... by the thousands in Nuremberg, but by all of Germany... which also sees you here for the first time today.
And I know thatjust as you serve this Germany proudly... all of Germany today will see its sons marching in you with proud joy!
ViktorLutze, S.A. ChiefofStaff atSA Night Rally
Hail Victory!
Hail Victory! Hail Victory!
Comrades.
Many ofyou here tonight knew me... as an SA man... marching in the rank and file... in the first years of the Movement.
And Party Comrades, just as I was an SA man then... so I am still an SA man today!
We SA workers will always be true only to the Führer... and fight for the Führer.

My Leader!
My Comrades!
We live again for this hour which makes us proud and happy.
According to your command, my Leader, a youth stands here... a youth that knows neither class nor caste.
The young generation of our people follows afteryou.
Just as you demonstrate the highest self-sacrifice in this Nation... so does this youth wish to be selfless.
Because you embody the concept of fidelity for us... therefore we wish to be faithful.
Adolf Hitler, the Leader of German Youth, attention!
My German youth.
After one year
I can greet you again here.
You standing here today represent something... that is happening all over Germany.
And we want that you,
German boys and girls... will absorb everything that we wish for Germany.
We want to be one people... and through you, to become this people.
We want a society with neither castes nor ranks.
And you must not allow these ideas to grow within you.
We want to see one Reich.!
And you must educate yourselves for this.
We want this people to be obedient... and you must practice obedience in yourselves.
We want this people to be peace-loving... but at the same time to be courageous.
And you must, for that reason, be both peace-loving...
You must be both peace-loving and strong.
We want this people not to become soft... but to become hard and, therefore... you must steel yourselves for this in youryouth.
You must learn sacrifice... and also never to collapse.
Whatever we create today... whatever we do... will all pass away... but in you Germany will live on.
And when we can no longer hold... the flag that we tore from nothing... you must hold it firmly in your fists!
And I know that it cannot be any other way... as we bind ourselves together.
Foryou are flesh ofourflesh andbloodfrom ourblood.!
The same spirit that governs us... burns in youryoung minds.
And when the great columns of the movement... sweep through Germany today... then I know that you will close ranks... and we know that Germany lies in front ofus...
Germanymarches within us... andGermany followsbehindus.!

''Sea ofFlags''... and ''CathedralofLights'' on Zeppelin Field.
Ayear ago... we met for the first time on this field; the first general review of political leaders... of the National Socialist Party.
200,000 men have assembled here.
They are not here at the summons of their hearts alone... but also at the summons of their loyalty.
It was the great calamity of our people that drove us to the struggle... brought us together... and left us greater.
Those who do not understand... have not experienced the same calamities among their people.
These things appear enigmatic and mysterious... that hundreds of thousands would be led to assemble... amidst calamity and passion.
Others cannot understand... that this is not an order of the State.!
Theyare deceiving themselves.!
The State doesnot orderus.!
We orderthe State.!
The State didnot create us.!
Rather we createdourown State.!
No, the movement lives... and it is grounded hard and fast.
And as long as one of us can draw a breath... he will give his strengths to the movement... just as it was in yesteryear.
Then drum will join drum... flag will join flag... group will join group,
Gau to Gau... and after that, this earlier divided people... will follow these sacred columns of the Nation.
It would be an outrage ifwe were to lose... what we have fought for... with so much labor, so much worry... so much sacrifice, and so many privations.
One cannot live faithfully and give up... what has given meaning and purpose to one's entire life.
That would not be so... if it were not a cardinal command.
And no earthly power gave us that command.
Forthe God, ourGod, who created ourpeople, gave us that command.!
So it is our vow this evening... that each hour, on everyday... to think onlyofGermany ofthe People andReich... andofourGerman nation.!
To the Germanpeople.!
Hail Victory.!Hail Victory.!

Our Führer, Adolf Hitler:
Hail Victory.!Hail Victory.!
SA and SS men:
A few months ago... a dark shadow cast itself across our Movement.
The SA and other institutions of the Party... had nothing whatsoever to do with this shadow.
They who would believe that a rift has opened in the unity of the Movement... deceive themselves.
Itstands fastas thisblockhere... and nothing in Germany will break it.
And when anyone does harm to the spirit of my SA... then the SA will not be harmed... but those who do this harm... will injure only themselves!
And only a fool or a known liar... could think... that I would ever disband an organization... that took us so manyyears to build.
My Comrades... we stand fast together for our Germany... and we must stand fast together for this Germany.
And I hand to each ofyou the new insignia... placing them with confidence... in the hands that I see as the most trustworthy there are in Germany.
For in the past you have proven your loyalty to me a thousand times.
In the time to come, it cannot and willnot be any different.
And so I greet you as myold, faithfulSA andSSmen.!

Deputy FührerRudolfHess at the Podium
The Führer speaks:
The Sixth Party Day of the Movement has come to and end.
What appeared like a show of political strength... for millions of Germans outside of our ranks.
For hundreds of thousands of fighters... it was ultimately more.
The great personal and spiritual meeting... of the old fighters and comrades in struggle.
And, perhaps, a cross section ofyou... despite the forced civility of this review of our Party... will return with courageous hearts to the days in which it was difficult to be a National Socialist.
When our Party consisted of only seven members... it already had two principles.
First, it would be a Party with a true ideology.
And second, it would be, uncompromisingly... the one andonlypowerin Germany.
We had to remain in the minority, because we mobilized... the most valuable elements of struggle and sacrifice in the Nation... which have always been not in the majority, but rather in the minority.
And because these are the racially best of the German nation... they can in the proudest self-esteem... claim the leadership of the Reich and the people.
The German people... and subordinated itself to this leadership in ever-growing numbers!
The German people is happy... in the knowledge that a constantly changing vision... has been replaced by a fixedpole.!
Whoever feels that he is the carrier of the best blood... and knowingly uses it to attain the leadership... will never relinquish it!
Ludwig Müller, Reichsbischof
(Reich Bishop ofthe United
German Evangelist Church)
There is always a part of the people who stand out as really active fighters... and more is expected from them than from the millions of national comrades in the general population.
For them it is not simply enough to make the pledge: ''Ibelieve.!''
Rather, the affirmation: ''Ifight.!''
For all time to come the Party will be the source of political leadership for the German people.
It will in its teaching... and was ultimately in its organization hard as steel... malleable in its tactics and adaptable in its entirety; yet it will be a training school like a holyorder for political leaders.
It must be shown, however, that all upstanding Germans become NationalistSocialists.
Only the best NationalistSocialists, however, are Party Comrades.!
Once, our enemies worried us and persecuted us and, from time to time... removed the lesser elements from the Movement for us.
Today we must examine ourselves and remove from our midst the elements that have become bad.
Andtherefore, do notbelong with us.!
It is our wish and will... that this State and this Reich last for thousand years.
We can be happy to know that this future belongs entirely to us.!
When the olderonesamong us falter... theyouth willstiffen andremain until theirbodies decay.
Only then, ifwe in the Party with our most obedient dedication... become the highest embodiment of
National Socialist thought and being... then the Party will materialize... into an eternalandindestructible pillar of the German people and Reich.
Then our glorious and laudable Army... the old, proud, standard bearers of our people... who are equally tradition minded... will champion the Political Leadership and the Party.
And then these two institutions will equally educate the German man... and, therefore, strengthen and carry on their shoulders... the German State, the German Reich.!
At this hour, tens of thousands of our Party Comrades are already leaving the City.
While many of them relive the meeting in their memories... still others are already planning the next review.
And again the people come and go and they will be engrossed anew and happy... and inspired, for the idea and the Movement live on in our people... and with the Movement are symbol of eternity!
Longlive the NationalSocialist Movement.!
Longlive Germany.!
Deputy FührerRudolfHess at the Podium
The Party is Hitler.!
But Hitleris Germany, as Germany is Hitler.!

Hail Victory!

This is the story of a film
that was never completed.
A film designed to serve
as propaganda for the Third Reich,
that empire infatuated with a camera...
that knew so well
to document its own evil...
passionately, systematically...
like no other nation before it.
A full decade after the end of the war,
East German archivists
began for the first time...
to sort through what remained
of Hitler's propaganda machine.
Thousands of films discovered in the exact
location in which they had been stashed.
A concrete vault hidden in a forest.
It is also there that one lone copy
of a film was found.
Over one hour long, with no soundtrack,
no opening or closing credits.
Only a brief title:
The Ghetto.
It was a rough first draft...
of the longest Nazi propaganda film
ever shot inside the Warsaw Ghetto,
the largest of the Jewish ghettos
established by the Nazis in occupied Roland.
The silent footage juxtaposes
meticulously staged scenes...
in which Jews are shown
enjoying a life of luxury in the Ghetto...
with images that required
no staging at all.
Why was the film crew
sent to film the Ghetto...
shortly before it would be wiped out?
And why was work on the film
cut short in the early stages of editing?
In the absence of
a final version of the film,
the intention of the propagandists
can never be determined.
One can only surmise.
Ironically, after the war,
this film commissioned by the Nazis...
turned into a trustworthy document
for any filmmaker or museum...
seeking to show what really happened...
to tell the untellable.
The cinematic deception was forgotten,
and the black-and-white images were
engraved in memory as historical truth.
From the frenzy of propaganda,
the images alone remain,
concealing many layers of reality.
May 1942.
The Warsaw Ghetto.
Two and a half years have passed
since the Ghetto was established.
And in three months, many of those
we see here will be sent to their death.
Here are images in which these people
are still fighting for their lives.
What the film doesn't tell is that nearly
half a million Jews were trapped here...
in a walled-in area
of less than three square miles,
in conditions
of unparalleled overcrowding,
plagued by hunger and typhus.
The Ghetto housed not only
the many Jews of Warsaw,
but also thousands of Jewish refugees...
deported from all corners of the Reich,
with no possessions, no language,
no chance to survive.
Those who were caught smuggling
food or attempting to escape...
were immediately captured and shot.
And, as in every other ghetto, here, too,
the Nazis had set up a Judenrat...
a Jewish council...
appointing as its head Adam Czerniakow,
whose job was to manage
for them from inside...
what had essentially become the holding
pen before the final destination.
As he fought a losing battle
to save all he possibly could,
Czerniakow insisted on documenting
the events of his life...
day by day, with urgency,
in nine diary notebooks.
And even as time was running out,
he made a point of writing extensively
about the shooting of this film...
and of his part in it...
an actor playing himself,
unaware how his role will end.
May 3, 1942...
At 10 a.m. The propaganda crew arrived.
They started to take
pictures in my office.
First, they staged a scene of rabbis
and petitioners entering my office, etc.
Then they removed
all the paintings and charts...
and brought in a nine-armed
candlestick with all the candles lit.
May 7, 1942...
On the streets, they are filming Jews.
Oh God!
What if I see someone I know?
I keep thinking that among all these people,
I might see my mother walking.
Leszno, the main street, was full of traffic.
I remember that once they filmed people.
Germans would often show up, usually for unpleasant reasons and usually shooting.
So, when they were filming, it was much more positive.
Anyhow, it was never good news when Germans showed up.
By this time in the Ghetto,
I was independent.
I was already 8 or 9 years old.
My mother let me play in the courtyard, and I went to all sorts of places by myself.
So, yes, I saw them filming.
They filmed beggars and all sorts of passersby.
At the time, I didn't realize that they had deliberate intentions.
But of course they did.
May 14, 1942...
The film crew is still
very much in evidence.
They are filming both the luxury
and the extreme poverty.
When I returned home at 4 o'clock,
I found uniformed filmmakers, etc.
They decided to film in our apartment.
I requested that a couple
be engaged as actors.
They placed a sign on the door
with something written on it.
Two women and a male "lover"
were brought to the apartment...
and they started filming.
In the meantime,
an old Jew with a Vandyke beard...
was seized on the street.
He sat in my apartment for hours,
but his photogenic qualities
were not used.
I can imagine what happened
when he returned home...
and tried to tell his wife
that he had earned nothing...
while waiting for three hours
to be a "star."
I wonder whether I will ever meet you,
my professional colleague.
Did we not both miss our destiny?
What on earth?
Where did one ever see a flower?
We would have eaten the flower.
Who could stay in their private apartment... with their furniture and their teapot? Who?
Only the privileged, like Czerniakow.
Jewish families weren't allowed to live in more than one room.
So, we took all the belongings we still had... and squeezed into one room.
At the same time, a family we had never met before... suddenly took over my parents' bedroom.
When they reduced the area of the Ghetto, we got expelled from our home, and we had to find a new place to live within two days.
We found a place and started to take our belongings there.
We were given a room and a kitchen.
And my father hired a man who had a cart with no horse.
Once, as we were pushing the cart... loaded with our possessions back and forth, we saw them filming near "Femina."
When we realized that we were in their way, my father got scared and let go of the reins.
The German jumped on him and beat him... until he fell down and the cart rolled away.
I started screaming like crazy.
My father was lying on the ground.
"Stop screaming," he said,
"or they'll beat you too!"
I put my hand over my mouth and stopped screaming, and the Germans left us alone and continued filming.
I looked up and saw two men... standing by a camera tripod.
They were filming outside.
The Ghetto was not a comfortable
work environment...
for the S.S. Officers who carried out
its step-by-step destruction.
They set up their headquarters
outside the Ghetto walls,
in the Brühl Palace,
located in the Aryan part of Warsaw.
In May 1942, their commander was the young
Kommissar S.S. Officer Heinz Auerswald,
who submitted to his superiors
weekly reports.
He described the developments
in the Ghetto,
including executions
he himself had ordered,
in the passive voice,
as though these things
happened by themselves.
Weekly Report, May 5, 1942:
The filming currently underway
in the Ghetto continues,
despite the lack of cooperation
by the inhabitants.
During the filming in the Ghetto,
there was an upheaval
in the Jewish prison.
When the film crew showed up...
with representatives
of the Jewish Council,
panic broke out among the prisoners.
Those imprisoned for leaving
the Ghetto illegally were convinced...
that they were about to be executed.
Women and children fainted.
Everyone calmed down...
only after the real purpose
of the visit became clear.
May 19, 1942...
Waiting for Auerswald's
phone call about the film.
In the afternoon,
a hall was prepared for filming...
where a ball with champagne
is to be held tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.
"The Ladies"are to wear evening dresses.
A messenger arrived
with instructions...
that I am to play the role of the host.
I called Auerswald,
who forbade me to perform.
He said that I should be
at the community center at 7:30,
as something might still change.
This means that the matter
has not yet been settled.
Will I have the strength to acquit
myself honorably from this affair?
Later I saw a hearse full of flowers...
taken from the cemetery
to the ballroom.
The city is full of rumors
about deportations.
They are talking
about tens of thousands.
Purposeful work under such
conditions is admirable,
and yet we do it every day.
For years, researchers tried to discover
who had made this film,
but none of the files...
not one of the documents they uncovered...
could solve the mystery.
Only later, in the 1960s, a lead was
discovered in the Warsaw City Archives.
It was a German entry permit
to the Ghetto,
issued at the time
of the shooting of the film.
A single document that disclosed one name:
Willy Wist,
along with his profession: Cameraman.
Willy Wist, who gave up filming
right after the war...
and became a scrap-metal merchant,
took great pains to cover his tracks,
burning copies of films
he had shot during the war.
Of all those involved,
he was the only one to be exposed.
Years later, when the German courts began
to prosecute local war criminals,
including the lawyer, former S.S.
Kommissar of the Warsaw Ghetto,
Heinz Auerswald, Wist was
among those called on to testify.
Court transcripts record exactly
what he was asked and what he replied,
providing for the first time a point
of view of the man behind the camera.
Herr Wist, the court would like to know... whether you were ever assigned to the Warsaw Ghetto during the war.
Yes.
In 1942, I was sent there from Berlin with three other reporters, cameramen and photographers.
We were stationed in Warsaw.
I worked there as a cameraman.
When exactly was this?
Probably in the winter of'41 -'42.
Herr Wist, allow me to refresh your memory.
This is your entry permit to Warsaw.
It is probably true that I was in Warsaw in May 1942.
I most likely said winter because...
I remember being in Warsaw... when nature was still hibernating.
Did you or your colleagues have any idea... what awaited you in the Warsaw Ghetto?
On our way to Warsaw, we cameramen... had no idea what awaited us there.
Like many times before, we were simply told curtly that we should film there.
I clearly remember filming trade on the streets.
We also filmed... street scenes... and overcrowded houses.
In this context,
I remember being told to film... a large pile of feces in the courtyard of one of the buildings.
I remember thinking to myself... that either because of the winter... or because of the overcrowding, the sanitary installations had stopped working.
Do you see the garbage?
People would throw their garbage out of their windows... because they were too weak to go downstairs.
Hungry people become apathetic.
They don't care anymore.
The piles of garbage are real.
I was ten years old at the time.
I was actually the dominant figure of my family.
Mother would send me to the Warsaw municipal garbage dump, and when I'd return home,
I saw how they were eating what I had brought.
May 5, 1942...
In the afternoon,
the filmmakers were busy...
in the bedroom of Zabludowsky's neighbors.
They brought in a woman who had
to put on lipstick in front of a mirror.
In addition to all this, there are
persistent rumors about deportations,
which appear not to be unfounded.
Kommissar Auerswald ordered us
to provide a contingent of 900 people...
to leave tomorrow for an unknown camp.
Have you met the Kommissar in charge of the Jewish quarter, Dr. Auerswald?
I am not familiar with this name.
I had nothing to do with his department.
Herr Wist, could you tell us, to the best of your knowledge, whether the purpose of the film was ever mentioned?
I never knew what the purpose of the films we shot was.
However, it was absolutely clear to me that they were intended for propaganda, particularly because we were focusing on the extreme differences... between the rich and the poor Jews
Oy, I remember that woman.
She used to walk around with her baby in her arms, screaming, and asking for a piece of bread.
I was 13 years old.
I used to smuggle Kosher meat into the Warsaw Ghetto... by tram, through houses near the Ghetto borders, through holes in the wall.
I was always on the move, so I saw everything that was going on.
They filmed all the time.
For example, they brought geese to the market... to prove that Jews were living in reasonable conditions.
This is horse meat.
Not everyone could afford it.
People who had goods or money... were able to buy food up until the very end, albeit at exorbitant prices.
There were 20, or possibly 50 people... who could afford it.
However, most people had nothing to eat, nothing to wear, or to heat with because they had sold everything.
They were waiting to die.
People from respectable families... would take their loved ones, who had died, out to the pavement.
In the morning, you woke up to find a corpse every 100 meters.
I was 18 years old and I worked at the post office.
One day I was walking on Leszno Street... when, suddenly, a big jeep with Germans in it... pulled up next to the café.
A young woman was lying next to the café.
Sixty years later, I still remember... what she looked like, though not her face.
I could see exactly what they were doing.
They didn't touch anyone.
They filmed the cafe and the woman and they laughed.
She was a young woman.
By then it was obvious who was starving.
You could see it on their faces.
Financial Report:
During March 1942,
the following were brought in:
2. 18 kgs flour per head,
0. 199 kg sugar
(white and yellow) per head,
1/5 egg per head,
0.93 kg fresh vegetables per head,
0.077 kg salt (white and grey) per head.
Since 1/5th of an egg per month
amounts to only 2.4 eggs per year,
it is evident that the population
resorts to free trade...
in order to ensure
a minimum level of nourishment.
Smuggling along the Ghetto walls
has been greatly reduced lately.
A number of Jews
caught smuggling were shot,
as a consequence,
the smuggling was reduced.
This is Rubinstein! For heaven's sake!
"Alle gleich," everyone's equal, he used to yell.
Do you see how people were lying on the street?
People lived here.
They lived here until they died.
What's the point of showing this?
To show contrasts? There were many contrasts in the Ghetto.
Many people kept clean and preserved their dignity.
We used to shower and brush our teeth every day.
Our mother took good care of us, even though the conditions were impossible.
People who are not starving to death... don't surrender their humanity.
People made jokes in the Ghetto and laughed.
Sometimes we would even sing.
People did what they could.
That was the tremendous contrast... and paradox that the Germans had created.
Herr Wist, were you aware of the restlessness among the Jews.. when the camera crews showed up accompanied by the S. S?
On the one hand, I was unable to have much contact with the Jews.. because the S.S. Immediately pushed them away.
On the other hand, they brought us Jews... they deemed appropriate for filming.
I do not know which department these S.S. Men belonged to... or who their commander was.
I'd like to point out that the Jews were frightened of the S.S.
There were no incidents during the filming.
While the Nazis recorded
their own version of history,
Jews were risking their lives
by creating in secret...
their own chronicle of life in the Ghetto,
using pen and paper instead of a camera.
Historian Emanuel Ringelblum,
courageous enough at the war's outset
to predict how it would end,
had begun organizing
a vast underground archive,
documenting the daily struggle
and annihilation...
of one of Europe's largest
Jewish communities.
Recognizing that a scholarly narrative
could never capture...
the many facets of this tragedy,
he called on anyone capable of resistance
to keep a personal journal.
Right up to his final days
in his place of hiding,
he carried out the task of compiling
dozens of individual voices...
into a multilayered portrait...
the final portrait.
Everyone wrote: Journalists, writers,
teachers, public figures,
the young and even children.
Everyone was aware of the value
of the work being done...
and its importance for future generations.
Our guiding principle was
that the work should be multifaceted.
Our second principle was objectivity.
We aspired to present the whole truth,
as bitter as it may be.
Some of my friends who know
about my secret diary...
have suggested that, given their
despair, I should stop writing.
"Why are you doing this? What for?
Will you ever publish it?
"Will your words ever reach the ears
of future generations?"
Nevertheless, I don't listen to them.
I feel that continuing the diary...
until I am no longer physically
and emotionally capable...
is a historical mission
that must not be underestimated.
My powers of creation
have not yet been silenced,
even though I haven't eaten
anything in five days.
They continue filming everything
inside the Ghetto.
All the scenes are being staged.
On Smocza Street,
they assembled a crowd of Jews..
and ordered the Jewish policemen
to disperse them.
To achieve a more "natural"effect,
guns were fired in the air
to induce people to flee in panic.
Forty-five years passed
from the moment...
the unfinished propaganda
film was discovered...
until chance revealed another film reel,
containing outtakes...
frames from the raw footage
left on the cutting-room floor.
Images that were never meant to be seen...
now revealed repeated attempts
to stage moments over and over again...
until a take seemed credible enough.
They reveal the multiple angles
from which these scenes were filmed,
as well as the cameramen themselves,
inadvertently captured
in one another's lens.
Do you know who told you and the other reporters what to film?
We were brought to the various locations by a man wearing an S. A... or brown party uniform.
We called him "Goldpheasant."
Can you recall his name and rank?
I have no idea what his name was.
Judging from his appearance, he must have held an important position.
I believe he was in charge of propaganda matters in Warsaw.
Could you describe what kind of contact you had... with this so-called "Goldpheasant?"
"Goldpheasant" sent us... to various scenes or groups of people.
He never gave us any explanation concerning the meaning of our filming.
He simply said that he wanted us to film this or that.
As far as I could tell, he knew nothing about film.
We constantly had to point out that under the given light conditions, we couldn't deliver reasonable pictures.
We didn't have a chance to express ourselves.
We were sent by "Goldpheasant"... to locations, to people, or groups of people.
You were not given a chance to express yourselves freely?
No, we were not.
I know for a fact that the film was processed in Berlin.
We were never told what happened with it after that.
Today they set up a film session
in Szulc's restaurant.
They rounded up well-dressed,
typical Jews,
seated them at the tables,
and ordered that they be served...
at the expense of the Jewish community:
Fish, geese, liquor,
pastries and other delicacies.
The Jews ate and the Germans filmed.
It is not hard to imagine
the motivation behind this:
Let the world see the paradise
in which the Jews are living.
These despicable scenes went on for hours.
Yesterday morning, the Germans
took all the waitresses outside.
The girls were lined up on the street...
and were instructed
to look happy and attractive.
At the same time,
they grabbed beggar-children...
and told them to walk
by the elegant waitresses...
with their hands out,
into which nothing was put.
This was recorded on film, to show
that while the Jews live in luxury,
they share nothing with the hungry.
My mother also wore her beautiful coat, maybe even a hat. So what?
Does that mean that life goes on as usual?
After the filming, these people vanished... after being loaded onto trucks or caught in some other way.
Perhaps they believed that being filmed would save them, but no way!
Their fate was the same as everyone else's.
Weekly Report, May 19, 1942...
There are rumors that gas was used
for the first time in this war,
on the German side.
Rumors about new resettlements from
Warsaw have been circulating for days...
and have created an enormous panic.
As usual, the "rumor-makers"
know from a "reliable source"...
that the German authorities intend
to resettle the Jews of Warsaw...
in the East.
The next morning at 8 a.m.,
all the actors were ordered to appear...
at the New Azazel Theater.
During the rehearsals
with the actors on the stage,
a group of soldiers picked up people.
People started running and panic ensued,
in the midst of which the Germans
treated everyone to heavy beatings.
Since no one knew why
they were being held there,
you could hear
the sighs and groans...
of the children who were picked up
together with their parents.
After each actor finished his part,
the audience had to yell "Bravo!"
The audience in the theater was held...
until the filming was finished at 8 p. M...
without food or any opportunity
to take care of their bodily needs.
When an actor sang happy songs,
the audience was ordered
to roar with laughter.
Woe to anyone who didn't laugh properly.
His fate was doomed.
They laughed as they had
never laughed before.
The Germans ordered all the actors
to overact as much as possible.
David Seiderman sang "My Yiddisher Mame."
Ruth Zandberg, who accompanied him
on the piano, wept bitterly.
Her mother, Yiddish actress Zusha
Zandberg, had just died of typhus.
The scope of the film is quite broad.
The filmmakers are interested in every
aspect of Jewish life in the Ghetto.
It isn't hard to guess
their intentions...
for this "artistic"project.
They aim to capture
very "objectively"...
aspects of the so-called
Jewish folk character.
In front of our eyes unfolds
the prologue to a great tragedy.
Even though we don't know its name,
we can sense what it's about.
The name of the prologue:
"A Jewfilm."
A group of artists arrived
from Germany...
with a list of scenes which
the community must prepare for them.
At that point, even the blind
could see where things stood.
The community had to prepare
a circumcision ceremony, a wedding,
the Sabbath, both in the synagogue
and the cemetery, and holidays.
This clearly had one intention:
To prove to the "righteous gentiles"
in Hitler's camp that they are right,
that there is only one way
to deal with the Jews: Annihilation.
I'd like to read you excerpts from the diary... of the Chairman of the Judenrat, in Warsaw, Adam Czerniakow.
Czerniakow wrote daily entries in his diary mentioning the filming.
The diary of the Chairman of the Judenrat survived?
Yes. I'll read you the following entry from May 1942.
You may interrupt and add details.
Czerniakow writes:
May 12, 1942...
Yesterday, they filmed
a demonstration of a circumcision.
They insisted that the circumcision
take place...
in a private apartment
instead of a hospital.
Since the "actor"weighs less than 2 kgs,
there is a danger
that he might not live very long.
I cannot recall this event.
It may have been filmed by other members of the crew.
Babies were born. Woe to those babies.
It was the end for them and the end for their families.
Apparently, my mother also got pregnant.
I remember my mother coming back from somewhere... and lying down in bed for two days.
I guessed that... she must have had an abortion.
And I think to myself how lucky we were... that this happened in the spring of'42.
If it had been three months later, when the deportation started, we might have all been sent to our death because of that baby.
This week they invented
a new way to torture us.
First, they rounded up dozens
of pretty young women...
and brought them to a Jewish ritual bath.
Then, men were rounded up
and brought to the same ritual bath.
While one Nazi whipped the heads
of those who were captured,
his colleague stood in a corner
with film equipment.
This is not slander. Here is the film.
I now recall... that one day we were told to shoot inside a ritual bath.
We were then brought to a rather old building... which had a bath on the ground floor or in the cellar.
Several naked women hesitantly stepped into the bath.
There were about 8 of them, standing up to their hips in water.
One was an old Jewish woman, who I believe was also in the water.
She murmured something which I understood to be prayers.
These were women who were somewhat better fed.
It was difficult to film in the bath because we didn't have enough light.
Today the Germans set up
an original film scene...
at the corner of Nowolipki
and Smocza Streets.
They used the finest hearse we have,
which was taken by the Germans
for the purpose of the film.
They want to prove that Jews
not only live a comfortable life,
but also die with dignity
and even get a luxurious burial.
No good will come to us
from this film craziness.
But Jews don't bury their dead in a coffin!
In the spring of'42, there were corpses on the sidewalks.
Someone like me, who could still walk, had to make her way between the corpses.
I hurried along the walls like a mouse, and suddenly a car pulled up.
Two Germans stepped out... and a third pointed a camera at the corpses.
I hid.
People who still looked more or less human... were kindly asked to walk by the corpses with their heads held high.
They walked by and came back, and walked by again and came back again.
It's true that we had to walk by.
No one looked, it was impossible.
We became indifferent to the suffering of others... because otherwise, it was impossible to live.
It was so terrifying because
I could be the next in line.
When it was already dark... and I was walking down Karmelitzka street, which was crowded with people,
I tripped on something... and lost my balance.
When I opened my eyes,
I saw that I had fallen on a corpse.
My face was nearly touching his, and I was shaking.
Then suddenly, it was as if all the corpses which
I had previously avoided looking at, were there, in the face of this one man.
It was a human being.
I got home and I told my mother what had happened.
It was only then that I started to cry,
I cried a lot.
I had always been so optimistic and strong, but suddenly it all broke down.
My mother took out some bread and spread some jam on it for me.
She gave me a slice of bread.
A slice of comfort.
May 1942.
The Warsaw Ghetto.
This was filmed by one
of Willy Wist's colleagues,
who had new film stock in color,
as well as his own personal camera.
It seems that he found time
to record personal memento of Ghetto life,
as well as of the making of the film,
including the large crowd scenes
staged by the film crew.
Here is the funeral procession.
And here, the market.
And for a brief second,
one of the cameramen...
can be seen caught in the frame.
Can you recall anything else about the filming in the Ghetto?
In the Warsaw Ghetto,
I remember seeing... a Jew going around with a handcart carrying corpses.
I saw how he picked up a corpse in front of one of the houses... and continued to the cemetery.
I remember seeing an arm and a leg hanging down.
At the entrance to the cemetery, there was some sort of shack... in which corpses were piled up.
There were some 40 or 50 corpses which still had to be buried.
I filmed this shack from the outside.
Today, I cannot watch this.
I am no longer immune.
Today I am human, today I can cry.
I am so happy that I can cry... now that I'm human.
I recall that I had to film a mass grave... with many layers of corpses.
I cannot say how many layers there were... beneath the layer which I could see.
I remember the corpses being eased into the grave on a slide.
Two Jewish workers were standing inside the grave, arranging the corpses next to one another.
I have a vague memory that the corpses were strewn with chloride.
Although I believe that the corpses were naked,
I am not certain about this.
The people were all skin and bones.
At the time, my impression was that the people had died of starvation.
These impressions in Warsaw had a profound impact on me, although later,
I got to see quite a lot.
They preoccupied my thoughts for quite some time.
Herr Wist, during the filming, you were really unaware of the plans to resettle and physically annihilate... thewish population in the near future?
I can only say that at the time,
I definitely knew nothing... of the horrible fate awaiting thews of Warsaw.
It was only after the war that I learned... about the planned extermination of thews in the Treblinka death camp.
During the filming in the Warsaw Ghetto,
I often had the opportunity to talk to thews... who had been sent there from Germany.
From these conversations, my impression was that they were full of hope... and that they expected... to be resettled in Madagascar or elsewhere.
They regarded their stay in Warsaw as temporary.
I am absolutely convinced that at the time they had no idea... what their real fate would be.
Although at the time, the malnourishment of the population... in Warsaw was appalling,
I never thought that these people... would be systematically murdered.
After 30 days of shooting,
the film crew packed up its cameras
and lighting equipment and was gone.
Less than two months later,
S.S. Officers appeared
in the office of Czerniakow,
the head of the Judenrat,
instructing him to draw up a list...
of many thousands Jews
for immediate deportation to Treblinka.
Czerniakow was most likely aware that
Treblinka was no more than a mass grave.
The following day, when the quotas oews
were significantly raised,
he swallowed the cyanide capsule he had
kept since the start of the war,
and in the silence of his death,
signaled his people: "This is the end."
These were also the days during which
the propaganda film was being edited.
Soon it would be buried
in the stacks of the archive.
On its box, a single title:
The Ghetto.
OK?
OK.
- OK?
- Yeah, l'll start again.
Same slate still running.
Cutthroat.
Keep running. lt'll get better.
Start all over again. Same slate.
OK, Rick, what's the game?
- Cutthroat.
- The object is?
The object is to keep your balls on the table and knock everybody else's off.
You're still there, huh?
We're gonna do one more song and that's it.
All right.
And happy Thanksgiving.
' Well, baby, don't you do it
' Don't do it
' Don't you break my heart
' Please, don't do it, don't you break my heart
' My biggest mistake was loving you too much
' And letting ya know

- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Good night. Goodbye.
(Robertson) OK, look.
We've been together 16 years.
- (Martin Scorsese) Who?
- Who?
The Band.
- You want me to plug that in?
- Let's do it again.
The Band has been together 16 years.
Together on the road.
We did eight years in bars, dives, dance halls.
Eight years of concerts and stadiums, arenas.
We gave our final concert,
The Band's final concert, and we called it The Last Waltz.
Why was it held in San Francisco, in Winterland, when you guys have been on the road for 16 years?
Winterland was the first place that the band played as The Band.
Some friends showed up and helped us take it home.
Not just friends. They're more than that.
Would you ask me that again?
They weren't just friends. They weren't just friends who came in to say hello.
You know what l mean? Get that fly!
No. They were more than just friends. l feel they're probably some of the greatest influences on music on a whole generation.
We wanted it to be more than just a concert. We wanted it to be a celebration.
Celebration of a beginning or an end?
Beginning of the beginning of the end of the beginning.

But, for some reason, it seemed like a good idea.
We got to this place, a joint, in Fort Worth, Texas. lt was burned out, bombed out. The roof wasn't even on the place any more.
And that's when they decided to call it the Skyline Lounge.
And we got there and set up and...
A big place.
Huge. Bar, way at the back and a big dance floor.
- Real old.
- So we set up the first night.
We go down to the place to play.
We go in and, in this huge place, there's about three people in the audience.
A one-armed go-go dancer and a couple of drunk waiters.
- A couple here, a couple there.
- Somebody fires a tear gas...
And a fight starts.
There isn't enough people in the place to get angry.
And we found out a few years later that it was Jack Ruby's club.

And the week went on and it was a little depressing.
And it was especially depressing cos we didn't have any money at all. No dough.
(Danko) At one point, we had no more food money. lt got to the point where, coming from
Canada, we had these overcoats, big overcoats with pockets and everything, and we had a little routine.
We'd go to the shopping centre, all together.
- But l stayed home, right?
- No, you didn't. l got the cigarettes. l turned the cigarette machine upside down and got everybody some cigarettes.
- Yeah, but that was on the...
- You got me some baloney.
We'd go to the supermarket and a couple of people would buy a couple of loaves of bread, cos that was about the cheapest thing you could get.
And the rest of us would be carousing the aisles, stuffing baloney. lt'd be time to leave, the guy with the loaves would go to the checkout and we'd say ''We'll meet you at the car. You take the bread out.''
- Ya'll come back!

Well, we were The Hawks.
Everything was fine.
We were sailing along.
And all of a sudden, one day, The Hawks meant something else altogether. lt was right in the middle of that whole psychedelia.
''Chocolate Subway''. ''Marshmallow
Overcoat''. Those kind of names.
When we were working with Bob Dylan and we moved to Woodstock, everybody referred to us as The Band.
He called us The Band. Our friends and neighbours called us The Band.
And we started out with The Crackers.
We tried to call ourselves The Honkies.
Everybody kind of backed off from that, you know? lt was too straight.
So we decided just to call ourselves The Band.

A dream come true.
Fascinating. Scary.
Kind of hard to take the first time.
You have to go there about two or three times before you can fall in love with it.
But that happens eventually.
We stayed at the Times Square Hotel on 42nd Street.
The title of the hotel, it sounded like it was conveniently located in midtown Manhattan.
What did we know? We came out of the hotel after checking in, and you think ''lt's great to be back in New York.''
Movie theatres for ever.
All these friendly women walking up and down the street. lt was... lt was great.
Yeah, New York, it was an adult portion. lt was an adult dose.
So it took a couple of trips to get into it.
You just go in the first time and you get your ass kicked and you take off.
As soon as it heals up, you come back and you try it again.
Eventually, you fall right in love with it.
Roulette Records was in the middle of this mythical place, Tin Pan Alley.
The songwriting capital of the world.
And we met some of the greatest songwriters ever.
Rock-and-roll songwriters. Doc Pomus.
Mort Shuman. Lieber and Stoller.
They were all then.
Carole King. Neil Diamond.
At the time it wasn't fair that a songwriter was the low man on the totem pole.
But then, these people...
And here come the '60s, with change and revolution and war and assassinations, and a whole other frame of mind coming along.
And these songwriters were expressing the feelings of people in the street. ln a way, it was kind of the beginning of the end of Tin Pan Alley.
' Dry your eyes
' Take your song out
' lt's a newborn afternoon
' And if you can't recall the singer
' Can you still recall the tune?
' Dry your eyes
' And play it slowly
' Just like you're marching off to war
' Sing it like you always wanted
' Like you sung it once before
' And from the centre of the circle
' To the midst of the waiting crowd
' lf it ever is forgotten
' Sing it long and sing it loud
' And come dry your eyes
' And he taught us more about living
' Than we ever cared to know
' And we came to learn the secret
' And we never let it go
' And it was more than being holy
' Though it was less than being free
' And if you can't recall the reason
' Can you hear the people sing?
' Right through the lightning and the thunder
' To the dark side of the moon
' To that distant falling angel
' That descended much too soon
' Come dry your eyes
' Dry your eyes
' Take your song out
' lt's a newborn afternoon
' And if you can't recall the singer
' You can still recall the tune
' Come dry your eyes
' Come dry your eyes
' Dry your eyes
(Robertson) Neil Diamond!
- (cheering and applause)
- Thanks very much.
When you started playing as The Band, you shied away from publicity a lot.
Talk about that a little.
That was just part of a lifestyle that we got to love in Woodstock.
We got to like it, you know, just being able to chop wood or hit your thumb with a hammer.
We'd be concerned with fixing a tape recorder, fixing a screen door.
Stuff like that.
And getting the songs together.
We always seemed to get a whole lot more done when we didn't have a lot of company around.
We were more productive.
And as soon as company came, of course, we'd start having fun.
You know what happens when you have too much fun.
Something we've kind of evaded around here, but l'll ask it now.
- What about women and the road?
- l love 'em.
That's probably why we've been on the road.
- That's it.
- Not that l don't like the music. l thought you weren't supposed to talk about it too much.
- No, l guess we're not.
- l thought we were supposed to... pan away from that sort of stuff, get into something else.
Since the beginning, since we started playing together, just like we've all grown just a little bit, so have the women.
- You know? And it's amazing.
- That's right. That's good. l just wanna break even.
(Robertson) Joni Mitchell. Right.
' No regrets, coyote
' We just come from such different sets of circumstance

' Where a local band was playing
' Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
' The next thing l know

' He pins me in the corner and he won't take ''No!''
' He drags me out on the dance floor and we're dancing close and slow
' Now he's got a woman at home
' He's got another woman down the hall and he seems to want me anyway
' Why d'you have to get so drunk and lead me on that way?
' You just picked up a hitcher
' A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
' l looked a coyote right in the face
' On the road to Baljennie, near my old home town
' He went running through the whisker wheat
' Chasing some prize down
' And a hawk was playing with him
' Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
' He had those same eyes, just like yours
' under your dark glasses
' Privately probing the public rooms
' And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors
' Where the players lick their wounds and take their temporary lovers
' And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play

' You just picked up a hitcher
' A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
' Coyote's in the coffee shop
' He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
' He picks up my scent on his fingers while he's watching the waitresses' legs
' He's too far from the Bay of Fundy
' From Appaloosas and eagles and tides
' And the air-conditioned cubicles
' And the carbon ribbon rides are spelling it out so clear
' Either he's gonna have to stand and fight
' Or take off out of here

Levon's home town, it's near West Helena.
One time we were there, for some reason or another, and we decided we were gonna look up one of the legends of that town, which was Sonny Boy Williamson. ln my opinion, he's the best harp player, that's like harmonica, blues harmonica, that l've ever heard.
He's the big Daddy of 'em.
And he took us to a friend of his, a woman's place, who served food and corn liquor. ln a southern booze can.
He would sit there and he was playing for us.
And we were getting drunk and trying to figure out where we were.
He was spitting in a can. l thought he was dipping snuff. l thought he had something in his lip.
And he kept spitting in this can and playing, and we kept getting drunker.
Finally, l looked over in the can and l realised it was blood.
He was getting pretty tired and pretty drunk by then.
And we made big plans for the future and all kinds of things we were gonna do.
And it was tremendous. A great night.
A couple of months later, we got a letter from his manager, or whoever it was, saying that he had passed away.
' Train arrive

(Robertson) Paul Butterfield!
Near Memphis, cotton country, rice country, the most interesting thing is probably the music.
Levon, who came from around there?
Carl Perkins.
Muddy Waters, the king of country music.
(Robertson) Elvis Presley.
Johnny Cash. Bo Diddley.
That's kind of the middle of the country back there.
So bluegrass or country music, you know, if it comes down to that area and if it mixes there with rhythm and if it dances, then you've got a combination of all those different kinds of music.
Country, bluegrass, blues music.
- (Robertson) The melting pot.
- Show music.
- (Scorsese) And what's it called?
- Rock and roll!
(Scorsese) Yes. Exactly.
Whoa!

OK. So, Rick, what is Shangri-La?
Maybe you could give us a little tour.
What is Shangri-La? lt's a club house where we get together and play. Make records.
Yeah.
Kind of better. lt's like an office, l guess. lt used to be a bordello.
- A bordello?
- You can tell by the wallpaper.
That decadence, that softness in the barroom. l've heard a few funny stories, man.
- That's why all these rooms are here.
- You can't believe most of what you hear.
This was a master-control bedroom, this is now a master-control music room.
Let me ask you, now that The Last
Waltz is over, what are you doing now?
- Eddie, why don't you...
- (' ''Sip the Wine'' intro)

Oh, yeah.
Trying to stay busy, man.
' l want to lay down beside you
' l want to hold your body close to mine
' Like a grape that grows ripe... lt's where the music took you. Otherwise you would never go to such a situation.
Because of the music, it took us everywhere. lt took us to some strange places.
- (Scorsese) Physically and spiritually?
- Physically, spiritually and psychotically. lt just always wasn't on the stage.
- Even though you were on the stage.
- Even though we were on the stage.

(Robertson) Garth was one of the most amazing musicians that we knew.
He could play better than anybody we ever heard.
And Garth joined The Band if we would make him the music teacher.
We didn't know why but we said
''Sure. l mean, we're interested anyway.''
And we had to pay him $10 a week each for these music lessons.
Then l was sure it was a riff.
But then l found out what it really was. lt was that, where he was coming from and his musical education, to tell his parents at this point that we was joining a rock-and-roll band would have been like pouring it down the drain.
So he justified it to his people and his background by being a music teacher.
There is a view that jazz is evil because it comes from evil people.
But, actually, the greatest priests on 52nd Street and on the streets of New York City were the musicians.
They were doing the greatest healing work.
And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.
' Boards on the window
' Mail by the door
' Why would anybody leave so quickly for?

' Was somebody up against the law?
' Honey, you know that l'd die for you
' They got your number
' They're scared and running
' But l'm just waiting for the second coming

' Please darken my door

' Mama, you know we broke the rules
' Was somebody up against the law?
' Oh, honey, you know that l'd die for you
' Ashes of laughter
' The ghost is clear
' Why do the best things always disappear?
' Like Ophelia
' Oh, please, come back home
Most of the show stuff, though, was like travelling shows, like tent shows.
One was Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels.
- (Scorsese) What was that?
- Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels. Yeah.
They used to have the show start, right?
They'd have the singers and the players and the different parts of the show.
Then the master of ceremonies would come out just before the finale and explain that, after the kids go home, they'd have the midnight ramble.
- (Scorsese) The midnight...?
- The midnight ramble.
The songs would get a little bit juicier and the jokes'd get a little funnier.
And the prettiest dancer would really get down and shake it a few times.
A lot of the rock-and-roll duck walks and steps and moves came from a lot of that.
Everybody did it and so, when you would see Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis or Chuck Berry or Bo Diddley really shaking it up, it didn't come out of nowhere, lt didn't come out of the air. lt was like the local entertainment everybody was going to see.
So when they exposed it to the rest of the world, it was like this unknown beast that had come out, the grotesque of music that the devil had sent, you know?
Here we go.

(Robertson) The road was our school. lt gave us a sense of survival. lt taught us all we know.
There's not much left that we can really take from the road.
We've had our share of...
Or maybe it's just superstitious.
- (Scorsese) Superstitious in what way?
- (Robertson) You can press your luck.
The road has taken a lot of the great ones.

Come back onto this leg.
Weight on this leg.
Pull your weight back onto this....
Off that leg.
Onto this leg.
Weight back, there you go.
Okay, just take with your arm.
You wanna slide forward... and reach with your arm.
And slide back, step back.
- Arnold, do it behind me.
- Reach back with your arm.
And forward.
I'll do this twice, and then I'll come and look at you and correct you.
And back. Now what you want is mobility.
So you want a pass-through position that will keep showing the body, right?
- So where are your arms?
- Like this.
Start, I would think, with the focus up.
- Looking up?
- Looking up.
That would help....
That'll make a nice....
If your eye line goes up there....
- Right.
- Yeah.
That's the idea.
What you have to realize....
Okay, take it a little bit slower.
What you have to realize is that people are watching you all the time.
They're not just watching you there and there.
Keep it up.
And....
Gold's Gym, Venice, California...
where many of the best bodybuilders in the world come to train.
Jesus Christ!
- That's a sick guy.
- You're back.
- How are you doing?
- All right.
- Big Mac.
- How are you?
- All right.
- Good.
- How you doing?
- You remember Joey?
How you doing?
- Paul.
- I thought you'd forgotten all about me.
I thought you liked me as well.
Thought you'd forgotten all about me.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're the greatest.
Big Tony, how you doing?
- This is for me?
- Yeah.
- Kenny.
- How you been? Just got back?
Can I sign up here?
I want to start gaining some muscles.
Come on.
Pumped up, you know.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, 28 years old...
6'2", 240 pounds.
Mr. Olympia for the past five years.
He is preparing to defend his title this year for the last time.
All Mr. Universes from the past five years or so... get together in one contest to find out who is the best of all the Mr. Universes.
So they created the Mr. Olympia contest, which is then the top contest.
And whoever wins that is the top bodybuilder.
- And you are the top bodybuilder.
- Right.
How long have you been the top?
I've not been beaten for the last seven years.
And...
I won the Mr. Olympia contest five years now.
This is now the sixth year.
- They score on points?
- Yeah, on points.
It's like judging the body by muscularity, and by proportion... symmetry, the whole thing.
Do you visualize yourself as a piece of sculpture?
Yeah, definitely.
Good bodybuilders have the same mind... when it comes to sculpting, than a sculptor has.
If you analyze it, you look in the mirror and you say:
"I need more deltoids, more shoulders," so you get the proportions right.
So what you do is you exercise... and put those deltoids on.
Whereas an artist would just slap on some clay on each side.
Does it, maybe, the easier way.
We go through a harder way... because you have to do it on a human body.
I mean, obviously a lot of people look at you... and they think it's kind of strange, what you're doing.
But those are the people who don't know much about it.
As soon as you find out what the whole thing is about... then it's just like another thing.
It's not any stranger as going into a car... and trying to go in a quarter mile, five seconds.
I mean, that's, for me, strange.
The greatest feeling you can get in a gym...
or the most satisfying feeling you can get in a gym, is the pump.
Let's say you train your biceps.
Blood is rushing into your muscles, and that's what we call the pump.
Your muscles get a really tight feeling...
like your skin is going to explode any minute.
It's really tight, it's like somebody blowing air into your muscle.
It just blows up and it feels different.
It feels fantastic.
It's as satisfying to me as coming is.
As having sex with a woman and coming.
So can you believe how much I'm in heaven?
I'm getting the feeling of coming in the gym.
I'm getting the feeling of coming at home.
I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up... when I pose out in front of 5,000 people,
I get the same feeling.
I'm coming day and night.
I mean it's terrific, right?
So, you know, I'm in heaven.
All right, got to do that.
This girl maybe didn't have a kiss for years.
I may as well give her a break.
Terminal Island, California...
a federal prison for men and women.
I wanna get me a kiss.
I heard about those guys in here.
Yeah, we got a few of them.
Come over here and I'll give you your kiss.
Yes, I got this pose.
He's got a beautiful body, man.
First time I ever seen somebody's arms 23 inches.
He's a big dude, all the way big dude.
I started reading about gaining weight and weightlifting in some magazines.
And I saw Arnold's picture.
And when I saw him from all those angles...
every angle those shots were taken from, he looked good.
And I said,
"That's the way I wanna look. "
My father's real tall and I'm short, so at least... if I can't get as tall as he is,
I wanna be as wide as he was.
Make one line.
Try to make one line straight.
So you always remember that you have to have a line.
Yeah, see now there's your line.
And look where you point.
Yeah.
Great.
I like what you had in Ironman.
Yeah, that's good.
Again, raise up the hand.
Remember one thing, when you pose... a lot of little guys have one habit.
And they hide away when they pose.
When they do an arm pose, they do like this.
The big guy will come right out with his arm.
Never do that, never hide away.
Like right now, you did like this.
You know, show them.
Show them the whole thing.
Make the move, open up the whole body.
Do the same thing again.
Yeah, great.
Look confident, yeah.
Good.
Yeah, do it!
Just pose slowly, good.
They'll go nuts.
Crowd's good tonight. Is it?
Close that arm more. Good.
Mike Katz.
31 years old, 6'1", 240 pounds.
One of the top amateur bodybuilders in the world.
Mike lives in North Branford, Connecticut, and is a junior high school teacher.
Show them the back, turn around for the back.
Good girl.
How about a "most muscular" in the front, like this, Michelle?
Like this, hands down.
Michael, show her the most muscular.
Good girl.
That's a girl.
- Can you do that?
- I can do that one, dad.
All right, you do that one.
Go ahead, one arm.
That's a boy, it's hard.
Feel this muscle, how hard that is, Michelle.
Feel up here, right here.
Isn't that hard? Yeah.
- Feel mine.
- Feel yours?
She wants you to feel yours, don't jump on me now. Come on.
Feel yours.
- Nothing, no muscle.
- Nothing? How about daddy's?
- Daddy got a big muscle?
- Yeah.
Come on, Mike, ripped, come on get up, come on.
Come on.
Good.
Get up.
Up.
Come on, up.
I can remember back in my life...
when I would be picked on quite often.
I'm sure every kid's gone through it.
But it just affected me more than,
I think, it would affect other people.
"Hey, four eyes, hey, cross-eyes. "
"You got rusty fenders on your bicycle. "
"Your bike isn't as good as our bike. "
"Hey, Jew boy. "
Or, "You're not Catholic, so you're no good. "
I can remember times when kids would be going to dances...
and I would leave a dance, like, 11:00 at night.
I'd leave a dance for no reason and say, "I'll show them. "
And go and run on a track for two or three hours.
Or go home and lift weights.
I got involved in all the peewee sports most kids play, hockey and so forth.
Then when I got into high school...
and I made all-state and all-American in football.
I was doing very well with the Jets until I got injured.
That was my biggest thing, to go on a football field and be so feared.
I wanted to be put in a cage and rolled out, like in a circus.
Big bars with chains and everything.
And then just hope like hell...
that everybody would run off the field when they saw me coming.
Let's give him a big welcome, Mike Katz.
In every contest I ever won...
or ever lost, I always got the most applause...
and the people were most for me.
When I went to the Mr. Universe contest in '72...
and in '73 and in '74...
I knew, even though
I didn't win the contest...
when I go to South Africa this year,
I'm sure the same thing is gonna happen.
The crowd is gonna be for me.
The contests in South Africa, in Pretoria... are the most important or prestigious amateur contests in the world... the IFBB Mr. Universe contest... which is amateur, open to amateur athletes.
Sort of along the guidelines of the Olympics.
And the other contest is a professional contest... open to professionals, because there's money prizes involved... and that's called the Mr. Olympia.
So I'll be competing in the Mr. Universe, since I am an amateur.
And... as I see it, from all of the people who I know who are gonna be there... and the best in the world will be there...
I feel it's gonna be between me and Ken Waller... for the overall championship.
I told you boys, I'm the quarterback.
I don't worry about Mike Katz, anyway.
The only one guy I worry about is Robbie.
He's good, but he lacks too many things.
His arms aren't big enough to match his chest.
His thighs are too big for his calves.
He hits one pose.
In that, he looks like a big spider.
What I'm gonna do when I get to Africa?
I'm gonna take Katz's shirt and hide it.
I'm gonna take everything I can find of his and hide it.
Mess his mind up a little bit.
Gonna be according to countries in alphabetical order.
Australia.
We need Australia.
Will you get your clan together, please?
Baghdad, Bahamas.
Tall man calls Mike Katz, USA.
I don't think there's much doubt.
Mike? All right.
Ken Waller, USA.
You didn't see a blue T-shirt around?
Paul, you see a blue T-shirt around with my crusher?
- Waller had it.
- He had it?
- Yeah.
- Where did he put it?
I don't know where he put it, Mike.
Number 89, from the United States of America...
Mike Katz.
It took me five years to win Mr. Connecticut.
It took me four years to win Mr. America.
This is my fifth year that I've been trying to win Mr. Universe.
I'm not a quitter.
It's like a dog. You can kick a dog so long and it will do two things.
It's either gonna roll over and die...
or it's gonna bite you and attack you.
And I'm the kind of person who's the type of a dog who would bite back.
I wasn't gonna roll over and quit.
Next one, 18, 18, 17, 18, 18.
- 83.
- 83? That can't be right.
It's a nine, yes.
17, 13, 16, 14, 11.
That's a four.
Yes, 13, 16, 14, 11.
- Total.
- 62.
Will the following gentlemen step forward?
They are the three finalists, not necessarily in order.
Ken Waller, USA.
Paul Grant, Wales.
Roger Walker, Australia.
And for your information...
the fourth-place winner was in fact Mike Katz.
Can you believe the tension with these fellas?
It's bad enough for you, how must it be for them?
So far, they made it, they made the big one.
They won the 1975...
IFBB Mr. Universe.
I wonder what time it is back in the States, do you know?
I've gotta call my wife.
- It's about 5:00.
- Good.
The kids ought to be playing, driving her crazy.
Third place in the tall man category...
IFBB, Mr. Universe...
from Wales, Paul Grant.
Second place...
from Australia, Roger Walker.
And the winner of the 1975 tall man category...
from the United States of America,
Ken Waller.
Kenny won. Great.
Terrific.
How about that?
Boy, that's fantastic.
Fantastic.
I can imagine how he must feel.
Incredible.
Probably like I did when I was 16 and won my first trophy.
In its own way, it's probably just as satisfying.
I gotta go shake his hand, that's fantastic, great.
And get my T-shirt.
Suffice to say the other two gentlemen won their height categories...
made the finals and our overall winner for 1975, Ken Waller...
United States of America.
- Want another pose?
- Yeah, just keep going.
Wait a second.
My parents in the beginning, when I started bodybuilding...
they didn't know really what it is...
until I introduced my father to bodybuilding...
and I took him to all the gymnasiums.
And he then started picking up weights, and making his arms strong and so on.
And then they started liking what I did.
Especially after I won the first international competition...
which was the first contest
I ever entered...
the Junior Mr. Europe in Stuttgart, Germany.
So when I came home with my trophy, my parents were very proud of me...
and they said, "My son, that's my son. "
My father was a police chief in Austria...
in a town called Graz.
We had a very strict upbringing because of him being with the police force.
We had to be the perfect example.
We couldn't do anything bad.
And it was kind of an uptight feeling at home because of it.
I always felt like my place is America.
And when I was 10 years old...
I only dreamed of coming to America and being the greatest.
And just being different than everybody else.
I never experienced anything like it.
- Open your legs wide, Arnold.
- Open my...
Get a little more power.
- Open your legs a little more.
- Little bit to the right.
Don't strain looking up at him.
Just put your face, just hug him, kind of sexy.
Crush it, Arnold.
Bend the exerciser.
I thought you were strong.
Put your legs behind his back a bit, could you?
Play with his hair a little.
Sandy, why don't you get down lower... so that your head is down closer to the floor.
That's it, right.
Okay, here we go.
Good, hold.
- You drink skim milk, don't you?
- No, I drink no milk.
- You don't drink any milk at all?
- No milk.
Milk is for babies.
When you grow up, you have to drink beer.
I was always dreaming about very powerful people.
Dictators and things like that.
I was just always impressed by people who could...
be remembered for hundreds of years.
Even like Jesus, being for thousands of years remembered.
- I dreamt about Arnold last night.
- Really?
I told him, "Arnold, you're making a big mistake going to Africa."
He says,
"Why do you say that, Mr. Ferrigno?"
I said, "Louie is waiting for you, in the shadows."
Lou Ferrigno, 24 years old, a former sheet metal worker.
Mr. America, and twice Mr. Universe.
He's turned professional this year, and is a contender for the Mr. Olympia title.
Lou lives with his parents in Brooklyn, New York.
At 6'5" and 275 pounds...
Lou is the largest bodybuilder ever.
And he thinks he can take the title from Arnold this year.
So does his father, Matty...
who retired from the New York City Police
Department to oversee Lou's training.
The first time Arnold came to America,
I took Louie backstage.
And when Arnold went by us,
I'll never forget...
I looked at Louie's face, and he just looked at Arnold with awe.
I thought God just passed us.
And I looked at Louie, I said,
"What do you think, Louie?"
And he looked at me, he said,
"Gee, Dad, he's big. "
And I would say that from that moment on when he first saw Arnold...
he wanted to be Mr. Olympia.
It was in his eye, in his heart, and in his mind.
And it became part of his entire body.
Okay.
- Right, let me complete a full rep.
- Okay.
- One.
- Right.
- Two.
- Right.
Up!
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
- Okay, Dad.
- Okay, come on.
Up, come on.
- Make it harder.
- All right.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
All the way.
All right. All right. All right.
- That was easy.
- Easy?
You do one.
Louie was only an infant in the crib, and he developed this ear infection.
We didn't know it at the time...
until Louie was about three years old, we found out that he was hard of hearing.
I guess that's why he never took an interest in things...
other kids would take an interest in, like television.
He was late learning to speak and everything.
Louie would become a lip reader.
Louie was a real skinny kid.
He couldn't make the football team because he was too skinny.
Then he started to buy Muscle Magazine.
I remember I would take him to a bookstore...
and he would buy up all the old muscle books.
And he would read for hours.
I remember...
2.:00, 3.:00 in the morning,
I would find his light on...
and he would be reading the muscle books.
So Louie decided to do a little bodybuilding.
I had an old weightlifting set in the cellar.
I used to do a little bit of it myself.
Never knowing at that time that someday...
Louie would be on the stage against Arnold, in Pretoria, South Africa.
You just keep after him.
Wherever he goes, you pose down with him, right next to him.
Let the judges make a comparison.
You're 6'5".
You'll be the biggest thing that ever went out on that platform, at 275 pounds.
They know that, and he knows it.
This is for the big baby, Louie.
This is for all the marbles.
And we're gonna go after it, right?
One year of training, all wrapped up in one night, Louie, remember that.
When you step out there, boy... remember all those grueling nights and mornings in the gym.
And this is it, this is the reward.
And we want it.
We want it so bad that we can taste it.
Remember that when we're on that stage.
We gotta get so excited, when we're there we have only one thought in mind.
That's the Olympia, we'll win.
- How long is Arnold sleeping?
- He's been here for a couple days now.
Yeah, a couple days?
The reason why I woke you up was because...
I am gonna go to New York tonight.
I did wanna say goodbye.
And I'm gonna see Ferrigno there.
We're gonna train for two, three weeks.
And everything... that I learned from you... that you stole from me,
I'm gonna give him.
I figure the combination's gonna be very hard to beat, Arnold, very hard.
I'll see you when you get back.
What should I tell Louie when I get to New York?
I mean, I am gonna train with him for a few days.
Tell Louie...
- that I said hi.
- Yeah?
Say to his father that I said hi.
And I'm looking forward to seeing him in South Africa.
- Okay?
- All right.
In other words, you want me to be very nice.
- Be very nice to him.
- Okay.
Because he needs a lot of help.
- See, the king of the hill can only go down.
- That's right.
- The king of the hill can only go down.
- Or stay up.
- Or stay on that hill.
- Right.
That's the other possibility.
But the wolf on the hill...
The wolf on the hill, right... is not as hungry as the wolf climbing the hill.
That's true, he's not as hungry.
But when he wants the food, it's there.
Biceps, the back, trapezius another thing.
Also, in fact, this evening I'm gonna jog about a mile and a half, two miles.
I think that's a good idea.
- You think we need more weight, Hank?
- Couple more pounds.
All right, good.
Here, we got 10 right here.
Come on, let's do 10 good reps, Lou.
10 good reps, come on.
- Come on, Lou.
- Come on, Louie.
Come on!
- No more.
- Come on, more!
Good boy. Come on.
- All right, good boy.
- That's the boy, Lou.
Not enough.
One more, same weight, Hank?
- I'm not satisfied. I'll put more weight.
- Let's go.
I wanna beat him!
I need 10 pounds.
- 10 pounds on each side?
- Yeah.
- How many, Hank?
- Come on, I wanna see ten.
- Ten!
- You're gonna do them, too.
- You're gonna wipe 'em out!
- I'll do it.
Come on, Lou, push. Drive 'em up.
That's it, man.
You're gonna do it, come on.
Arnold!
Six.
Seven. Goddamn, eight.
Come on, nine.
Suppose you get laid last night.
Keep going, ten. Come on.
Force them out, there's eleven.
Come on, Arnold.
Five.
Six.
Seven. Come on now. One.
Yeah. Two.
Three. Come on.
Four.
- Five.
- Harder!
- Come on, you can do it now.
- I can't concentrate with girls pushing.
Push.
All right, that's it, no more.
- Here's a present.
- What, are you crazy?
- Here, come on.
- God.
Make those arms grow, man.
Stick them out, stick it out, Louie.
Come on, get it up.
You do the work.
Come on!
Okay, take it.
Oh, my God.
- Good boy.
- Nice training.
Good boy.
Boy, what a workout.
Too hot.
- How do you feel, Lou?
- Pretty good.
Don't ever feel sorry for yourself.
Remember, if you're training hard, he may be training twice as hard.
You just gotta keep coming back stronger.
Right.
All the way, Louie, you'll never get this chance again.
All the way.
Look like a road map back here with fingers all over it.
Yeah?
Yeah, that's getting closer.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Two more.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four. Keep going.
Five. Keep going.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Come on.
Let's get serious.
Two more.
Two more, no matter what.
One more, Eddie. Flex when you come up.
Goddamn.
That's good.
The body that isn't used to maybe the ninth, tenth...
eleventh, and twelfth rep with a certain weight.
So that makes the body grow, then.
Going through this pain barrier.
Experiencing pain in your muscles and aching... and just go on and go on.
And this last two or three or four repetitions... that's what makes the muscle then grow.
And that divides one from a champion and one from not being a champion.
If you can go through this pain barrier, you may get to be a champion.
If you can't go through, forget it.
And that's what most people lack, is having the guts.
The guts to go in and just say, "I'll go through and I don't care what happens."
It aches, and if I fall down....
I have no fear of fainting in a gym... because I know it could happen.
I threw up many times while I was working out.
But it doesn't matter, because it's all worth it.
Franco Colombu.
The premier bodybuilder in the world under 200 pounds.
Five times a contender for the Mr. Olympia title...
he plans to win it this year from Arnold.
Once the featherweight boxing champion of Italy...
Franco comes from a small village in Sardinia.
Here, when you want to say,
"Where are you going?"
Somebody says, "Go to hell" when they get upset.
There they say, "Go to California."
It's like a place where you never get there.
And then finally
I came to California, really.
And now when I go back there and they ask me, "Where you live?"
I say, "In California."
They're not sure if I mean it or if I'm joking.
When I first started doing sports...
my mother used to scream at me.
She used to say,
"You don't want to work.
"You're just trying to punch people...
"trying to make a living without working."
And she was very much against that.
But right now, after everything went so good...
and I won in sports and I made money...
they are very proud about that.
I'm the strongest bodybuilder that ever lived, I think.
Ladies and gentlemen...
the strongest man in the world is blowing up a hot-water bottle.
That takes 600 pounds of pressure.
It's gonna pop.
- Okay, Franco.
- Lazy bastards.
Look.
I missed it.
Okay.
I met Arnold in Germany.
He came to United States,
I came to United States, also.
We went through many things together.
And now, I will be competing in the Mr. Olympia with Arnold.
Of course, I think I'm gonna win.
I have more definition...
and I'm more muscular.
But Arnold's taller than me, and that can be one advantage for him.
I think I can show the best out there.
The only problem now is matter of the judges' opinion, too.
You never really know what's going to happen.
Okay, Louie.
No, listen.
When you come out here and you're out here....
Right? They're all waiting for you, Louie.
They wanna see what you got, they've never seen you before.
You tense your legs, right?
Then you look at the crowd.
They're all looking at you.
Flashbulbs going off and all.
Then you put your arms like this.
You look at your arms like you're admiring, right?
You're admiring what you're gonna show them. And then you go....
Boom! Like you're saying:
"Take a look at this hunk of man."
Something like that. You try it now.
Look up, that's right.
That's it. No, down here, Louie.
I told you, look at your arms down here.
Look at both arms.
- Both arms?
- Right.
That's it.
Atta boy.
Now hold that pose.
Because remember, your arms are bigger than Arnold's.
They wanna see them, right?
They have never seen your arms.
They've seen Arnold's.
So hold that pose a while.
And I say, this pose, just tilt your body a little... because people on this side of the theater... and people on this side wanna see you.
So tilt your body just slightly like this.
Try that, Lou.
Atta boy.
You have to do everything possible to win.
You know, no matter what.
The day of the contest, if he comes in his best shape... and he's equally as good as I am... or if, let's say, he's a few percent better than I am...
I spend with him one night.
I go downstairs and book us together in a room... to help him for tomorrow's contest.
And... that night... he will never forget.
I will mix him up.
He will come so ready to South Africa, so strong.
But by the time the night is over, the next morning... he will be ready to lose.
I mean I will just talk him into that, it's no problem to do.
So, all those things are available.
And if they're available, you might as well use them.
So it doesn't matter if he comes in shape, or out of shape.
If he comes out of shape, at least it's less hassle for me.
And if he's in shape....
Fine, I hope he is.
But you couldn't pull this with Franco.
Franco's pretty smart.
Franco is pretty smart, but Franco is a child.
When it comes to the day of the contest, I'm his father.
He comes to me for advices.
So, it's not that hard for me to give him... the wrong advices.
Pretoria, South Africa.
Probably in an hour or two, we have a chance to see our room.
10 minutes.
I promise.
Can I just ask you one question?
The usual we ask.
What must your... special woman look like?
It really doesn't matter.
I like them with black hair, with brown hair, with red hair.
With big breasts, with little breasts, with big ass, with a little ass.
If the personality is great and if they're charming....
Wonderful, nothing to do, just lay out in the sunshine.
Can't wait to get into the sun.
Look at that sun out there.
We ordered it for you.
Watch out now, Lou.
- This is good.
- Get ready.
Holy cow.
He likes the oil.
Hold it up, that a boy, Lou.
Tense your muscles, Louie.
Pull in your stomach.
Sometimes when people ask you advice... if you think that they're being arrogant, or misusing the sport of bodybuilding... you give them kind of pranksterish advice.
And that's once happened in a Mr. Munich contest, I believe.
I think it was eight years ago... when some fella came to me in the gym and said:
"I want to win Mr. Munich.
I am a perfect poser...
"and I have a fantastic body.
"And I just want to learn a new posing routine, a new style.
"Something way out which nobody expects."
So I said, "Let me see your posing routine you have right now."
When the guy took his clothes off and posed for me... he looked like nothing, number one, and his posing was bad.
So I mean, he was just....
I think he was crazy.
So I thought, okay, if he thinks that he's the best poser...
I'm gonna pull a little trick on him.
And so that's what I did.
I said, "Listen, I have a new posing routine from America.
"I'm in correspondence with all the top athletes in America." And so on.
And I told him that the new thing is... that he has to scream while he's posing.
And he looked at me and he says...
"That's a new idea.
That will really come out impressive.
"When you go out on stage and scream, people can't miss you.
"They'll all look at you screaming, that's it."
So I taught him how to scream.
First of all, I oiled him up.
His body, with really heavy oil and everything.
We're standing there in the shower room.
And I taught him how to do it.
The higher your arms go up, the higher you make a screaming noise.
And the lower your arms come down, the lower the noise.
This kind of a thing.
I practiced with him for around two hours.
Spent a lot of time on developing his new posing routine.
And he mastered it very well.
He was screaming really loud and high and low.
And he went to the Mr. Munich contest.
I told him when he walks out, he has to scream loud, run out.
And so he did.
And obviously people weren't ready for that at all.
And so, he went out there, screamed loud.
Went through three or four poses with loud screaming.
They carried him off the stage and threw him out.
They thought the guy was totally nuts.
I'm shaking, really.
But when I get there,
I think I'll forget about it.
- Forget about it?
- Yeah.
When I get there, I'm even more nervous.
I'm not nervous at all.
Thank you.
Jesus Christ.
- Take it easy.
- What can I say?
You guys are psyching me out here early in the morning.
- The only way to do it.
- Lay down in the bus in the back.
Hey, Lou. Is this the master plan here this morning?
Right, be on guard.
I'm here now for six days and nobody invited me for breakfast.
This morning they say, "Come for breakfast with us, Arnold, have a nice breakfast."
He's talking about pumping up.
He's talking about psyching me out.
She's talking about my mother.
You're the king of kings, Arnold.
Shit. He's rubbing it in.
How are you doing, Lou?
- How you doing?
- Good.
Look kind of worried today.
Just a little tired, gotta wake up.
- They don't come nicer than you, Arnold.
- I'm a nice guy.
I wouldn't turn my back on you, Arnold, within 500 yards.
You don't trust me, why's that?
They should have the Olympia early on so we could relax, enjoy the country.
They should have it in a month for him.
He isn't even in shape yet.
He didn't get the timing right,
I'm telling you.
A month from now would have been perfect for you.
But then I'd get bigger, too, again... so doesn't matter, what the hell.
Let's get it over with.
And if you retire this year, you just never had the Olympia.
But you had twice the Universe, what the hell.
That's not too bad, either.
You could go on and win the next five years.
It's amazing. Can you imagine the feeling I have? Six times Mr. Olympia.
I told you, you've found the fountain of youth.
You could go on forever.
- It blows my mind when I think about it.
- People are so tired...
I called my mother yesterday already and I said, "I won."
She says, "Congratulations, Arnold."
Anyway, listen, guys, why don't we go?
You go and help him pump up.
Calm him down, help him. Okay?
Don't screw him up this time.
I don't want you in our pumping room.
Judges.
Final attention, you all understand our strict code and rule.
No talking whilst adjudicating.
And that also means, photographers, please do not speak to the judges.
I'll simply will have to remove....
Most of the judging at an international competition takes place during the day...
before the crowds and distractions of the nighttime show.
This is called the prejudging.
Double biceps, rear.
The judges look for three things.:
symmetry, proportion and the size and clarity of each muscle group.
Olympia contestants are judged in two classes.
Those over 200 pounds and those under.
At night, the two class winners will pose off for the overall title.
Each class poses first as a group, for comparison judging.
Then they come on one at a time to perform the six compulsory poses...
that show every part of the body.
He's so crazy.
What a monster.
Oh, my God.
These guys are like animals, man.
I can't believe it.
Look at this one now.
See, this is the hard part right here, look at that.
And your lats from the rear.
What's he got? Let's see.
You can call him "the bat" from now on.
- "Franco the bat."
- He could fly with that.
Finish with the left side chest... and your optional routine.
Nice shot, goddamn it.
That guy.... It gives you chills when you watch that guy.
I know. Isn't it unbelievable?
Look.
Ed Corney, a 44-year-old nightclub owner originally from Hawaii.
He is Franco's chief competition in the under-200-pound class.
Can you believe that?
I mean, that's what I call posing.
Okay, turn to your right,
Serge, face that way.
Turn right on. Look straight ahead.
That's it. That's the position we want.
An unexpected entry in the tall class of the Olympia contest.
Serge Nubret, 41 years old.
Six feet, 200 pounds.
Mr. France, and a movie and television star in Europe.
Don't lean back too much, you get wrinkles in the back.
- Don't go back too much.
- All right.
Okay, thank you.
Your back was out of sight.
Your back, fantastic.
Do I need more arm?
Louie, you should've did this one for your arms.
They called it.
I didn't wanna look small.
You mean this one?
No. You're wrong.
- Okay.
- Look, looks like nothing.
The arms are important. You've got arms, and he's got spaghetti arms, Louie.
I don't have any weak points.
I had weak points a few years ago.
But my main thing in mind is....
My goal always was to even out everything...
to the point that everything is perfect.
Which means if I want to increase one muscle a half inch...
the rest of the body has to increase.
I would never just make one muscle increase or decrease.
Because everything fits together now.
And all I have to do now is get my posing routine down more perfect...
which is almost impossible to do.
It's perfect already.
Yeah, it's down to a point.
Wait when you see it.
Relax.
Thank you, Arnold.
If you want to be a champion... you cannot have any kind of an outside negative force coming in and affect you.
Let's say before a contest, if I get emotionally involved with a girl... that can have a negative effect on my mind... and therefore destroy my workout.
So I have to cut my emotions off... and be kind of cold, in a way, before a competition.
That's what you do with the rest of the things.
If somebody steals my car outside of my door right now...
I don't care.
I can't be bothered with that.
I would only have my secretary call the insurance agency and laugh about it.
Because I cannot be bothered with it.
I trained myself for that.
To be totally cold and not have things go into my mind.
And it was, in a way, a sad story... when my father died.
Because my mother called me on the phone, and she said:
"Your dad died."
And this was exactly two months before a contest.
She says, "You come home to the funeral?"
I said, "No.
"It's too late, he's dead, there's nothing to be done.
"And I'm sorry, I can't come."
And I didn't explain to her really the reasons why.
I had other excuses to her, because how do you explain a mother... whose husband died, you know, your trip?
I didn't bother with it.
And that actually caused one of the greatest conflicts... with my girlfriend.
Because she just looked at me and said:
"It doesn't bother you?
"I mean, your father died."
I never talk about it again.
The finals of the Mr. Olympia contest.
First to be judged is the under-200-pound class.
He said 20 minutes from now, right?
- Take your time, you got all the time.
- Yeah.
Second place in the under-200-pound category...
from the United States of America...
Ed Corney!
And the winner... of the 1975 Mr. Olympia, under 200 pounds...
from the United States of America, via Italy...
Franco Columbu!
What did you say, Louie?
- What did you say?
- I'm training, Arnold.
- Gotta get a good pump.
- You make too much noise.
Supposed to be very quiet here, like in a church.
Tell him.
- I can take you.
- Keep looking.
- Thanks a lot.
- You've got a better neck.
I know.
- I watch you.
- I watch you, too.
There's a barbell above my head,
I better watch it here.
Okay.
We don't want no accidents here.
What symmetry you've got. You look like something Michelangelo cut out.
More oil, more. That's not good oil.
- Lou, relax.
- Would you?
- Tell them that we're ready.
- We are ready.
And now we come to the heavyweights...
over 200 pounds.
We have three contestants.
From the United States of America...
Lou Ferrigno!
From France, Serge Nubret.
From the United States via Austria...
the one and only, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Now we'll call on all three contestants...
Lou Ferrigno, Serge Nubret, and Arnold Schwarzenegger...
for a pose-down for the final decision from the judges.
Louie goes through his posing, and you watch every pose.
You sort of help him out, easy now.
Each pose he goes through, you're living it with him.
I mean, you just have to try to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
That you're actually out there with your son...
because you trained with him and you're posing with him.
The only thing you're not doing with him...
you're not getting the reward of the applause.
He's the one that's getting that, and he deserves it.
And you just hope the audience gives him more.
You wanna shout out,
"It's my son out there!
"Give him just a few more handshakes, a few more applause. "
And you just hope that he's the winner, that's all.
Third place, from United States of America...
Lou Ferrigno!
Second place, from France, Serge Nubret.
And the winner...
the one and only, Arnold Schwarzenegger!
Ladies and gentlemen, the two body-weight winners...
Franco and Arnold.
Come on, Franco, give him hell.
- This little guy he's talking about.
- Where is he?
Turn around.
Let's go.
The winner of the 1975...
overall Mr. Olympia...
the one and only, the greatest...
Arnold Schwarzenegger!
Louie, you're a baby, Lou.
These guys are all veterans.
You're just growing.
This takes years and years.
In two years, Louie, they'll have never seen anything like you.
They'll think you were carved out of stone.
Just gives you the motivation to train harder.
Your day will come, Louie.
Someday you'll have a back,
Louie, nobody ever seen.
So it's no more, because it was my last year of competition.
I would like to announce officially
I'm retiring from bodybuilding competition.
I would like to thank you all for supporting me.
I would like to thank the judges.
Bodybuilding has been a beautiful experience for me.
And I will continue it for the rest of my life.
I only stop competing, but I'm not stopping bodybuilding.
It's the greatest sport. Thank you.
I want to have everybody sing
Happy Birthday to Lou... because it's Lou's birthday today.
It's Lou's birthday today, too.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday dear Louie
Happy birthday to you
All right!
Speech!
I have nothing to say,
I just wanna eat my cake.
I'm gonna come over and have a nice meal over at your house.
- Some good cheesecake.
- You're gonna come over?
Yeah, I will, when I come back from Austria, I'm gonna call you.
And she's gonna fix her nice spaghettis, meatballs... cheesecake, apple strudel, the whole business.
Yeah, she says she's gonna bulk me up to 280 pounds.
And then she's gonna fix me up with your sister.
I'll talk to him later on.
Louie, he moved over for you, Louie.
Let's put him out, Louie.
Big Louie.
Yeah, I'm in Africa.
Yeah, Africa's my home.
Damn America and what America thinks.
Yeah, I live in America, but Africa's the home of the black man.
I was a slave 400 years ago, and I'm going back home to fight among my brothers.
Yeah!
For these two African Americans to come home was of great, great significance.
Because of Hollywood and TV, a lot of us had been taught to hate Africa.
There was a time if you called a black person "African," they'd be ready to fight.
When I get to Africa, we gonna get it on because we don't get along!
I'm gonna eat him up!
Too much speed for him!
Too fast! Too fast! That's right!
I'm gonna retire the heavyweight champion of the world!
I'm gonna retire the heavyweight champion of the world!
September 25, the world will be stunned!
- Tell 'em, Ali!
- That's right.
If you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait till I kick Foreman's behind!
An 18-year-old amateur boxing champion with a charming smile took a physical examination for his first professional fight.
It won't be an easy fight, but my plan of attack on a fighter like Alex Miteff would be two fast left jabs, a rapid right cross and a left hook.
But in the Belgian Congo, freedom was followed by rioting and army mutiny.
For months, the political pattern kept changing with kaleidoscopic speed until pro-Red Premier Lumumba was seized by the forces of strongman Colonel Mobutu.
After watching Mike DeJohn and Eddie Machen the other night,
I would rate myself number two now.
I'm out to break Floyd Patterson's record, and by this being my 20th birthday, today, January 17, that leaves me exactly one year to reach my goal.
People do say I'm cocky.
Some say I need a good whuppin'.
Some say I talk too much.
But anything that I say,
I'm willing to back up.
The other night I predicted that I would knock out this Banks in four rounds, and I did.
I knocked out Don Warner in four rounds, and I just annihilated George Logan in four rounds.
Let me see you close your mouth and just keep it closed.
- You know that's impossible.
- No, keep it closed.
You know that's impossible.
I'm the greatest.
I'm knocking out all bums. And if you get too smart, I'll knock you out.
- You'd take him on before the fight?
- Beat him like I'm his daddy.
I saw Sonny Liston a few days ago, Cassius...
Ain't he ugly?
I'm young, I'm handsome,
I'm fast, I'm pretty, and can't possibly be beat.
Cassius Clay goes into the record book with Corbett, Tunney and Braddock as another who brought off one of the great upsets in the heavyweight history.
It is befitting that I leave the game just like I came in... beating a big, bad monster who knocks out everybody and no one can whup him.
That's when that little Cassius Clay from Louisville, Kentucky, came up and stopped Sonny Liston, the man who annihilated
Floyd Patterson twice.
He was gonna kill me!
But he hit harder than George.
His reach was longer than George.
He's a better boxer than George.
And I'm better now than I was when you saw that 22-year-old undeveloped kid running from Sonny Liston.
I'm experienced now, professional.
Jaw's been broke, been knocked down a couple times.
I'm bad!
Been chopping trees.
I done something new for this fight.
I done rassled with an alligator.
That's right.
I have rassled with an alligator!
I done tussled with a whale.
I done handcuffed lightning, throwed thunder in jail.
That's bad!
Only last week, I murdered a rock!
Injured a stone! Hospitalized a brick!
- I'm so mean I make medicine sick.
- Bad dude!
- Bad. Fast.
- Ain't no doubt.
Fast! Fast!
Last night,
I cut the light off in my bedroom, hit the switch, was in the bed before the room was dark.
- Incredible. Incredible.
- Fast.
And you, George Foreman, all you chumps are gonna bow when I whup him!
All of you! I know you got him.
I know you got him picked.
But the man's in trouble.
I'm gonna show you how great I am!
Hell, I think Ali was scared.
I think he was scared even then.
He knew he was gonna be very scared as he got closer to the fight.
You know the way George fights.
George comes out...
I named him the Mummy!
With his ego, he could keep telling himself he would dominate Foreman, that he would beat him, that he would dance, make a fool of him, that he would show him superior boxing, that Foreman would never lay a glove on him.
But in fact, in his sleep or wherever his private moment came, he had to know that he had not done nearly as well against two fighters particularly:
Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, whom Foreman had demolished.
Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!
The heavyweight champion is taking the mandatory eight count, and Foreman is as poised as can be!
Foreman is going about his job!
He had an overpowering intensity when he punched.
Foreman had won his championship by knocking Joe Frazier out, and knocked him down something like seven times.
Then he destroyed Ken Norton in two rounds.
The word "murderous" does not quite apply.
Foreman was awesome.
This chump has got everybody scared.
Scared of what?
Nothing to be scared of.
Scared of what?
How many fellas in here now picks George?
Be truthful. Be men.
Tell the truth.
John, raise your hand.
Got George?
You got George? Tell the truth.
- You. You, fella. Yeah.
- Me?
- No pick.
- No pick?
I just wanna know. You got George.
The time may have come to say good-bye to Muhammad Ali, because very honestly,
I don't think he can beat George Foreman.
Howard Cosell, you told everybody
I don't have a chance.
You told 'em
I don't have nothing but a prayer.
Well, chump, all I need is a prayer, because if that prayer reach the right man, not only will George Foreman fall but mountains will fall.
Maybe he can pull off a miracle.
But against George Foreman?
So young, so strong, so fearless?
Against George Foreman, who does away with his opponents one after another in less than three rounds?
It's hard for me to conjure with that.
You're always talking about,
"Muhammad, you're not the same man you were ten years ago."
I asked your wife, and she told me you're not the same man you was two years ago!
After this fight,
I suspect Ali will retire.
And through all of the years, my own memories of him will be as a fighter and as the strange and curious and gregarious and engaging and sometimes cruel and sometimes family man that he is.
I'm gonna let everybody know that that thing you got on your head is a phony, and it comes from the tail of a pony.
A stolen bicycle.
He had a bicycle, and he went to Columbia Gym.
There was something going on up there, and he left his bike parked outside.
So when he came out, someone had stole it, and he went inside, and he was crying, and he told the policeman there, his name was Joe Martin, that someone stole his bike.
And Joe Martin, he would also teach the little boys how to box in the evening.
So he asked him, would he be interested in learning how to box?
And he told him yes, because if he ever found out who stole his bike, he wanted to know how to fight so he could beat them up.
An overhand right sends Sonny to the canvas!
Referee Jersey Joe Walcott trying to get Ali to a neutral corner.
Ali yelling at Liston to get up and fight!
The anchor punch.
- Which punch?
- Anchor. I call it the anchor punch.
- The one Stepin Fetchit helped you with?
- Yeah, man.
And people couldn't see it.
It was so fast...
Sports Illustrated clocked it.
They got a slow-motion camera.
They clocked the punch, and the punch flew at 4/100 of a second.
You can break a second down to a hundred pieces.
You know how people win a ski race, they say, "He won in 16/100, he won in 32/100 of a second."
So you break a second down to 100 pieces.
So, you know, yeah, it's quick.
So 4/100... They got a machine that goes, like, br-r-r-t, real quick.
Br-r-r-t. And it counts real quick.
You know, br-r-r-t. Real quick.
And by the time that thing hit four, that's how quick...
From the time the punch started to where it landed, it was 4/100 of a second, which is an eye blink.
Like a camera flash.
That's 4/100 of a second.
Now, the minute I hit Sonny Liston, all those people blinked at that moment, and that's why they didn't see the punch.
I swear.
If you watch the film close...
You gotta hold your eyes real close...
Keep looking.
All right, I'm getting ready to hit him.
You can't just...
You got to hold your eyes and wait or you won't see it, man!
They have this beautiful, you know, specimen, a fighting machine, that was handsome, he was articulate, he was funny, charismatic... and was whuppin' ass too.
Deposed heavyweight champion Cassius Clay, at a federal court in Houston, is found guilty of violating the US Selective Service laws by refusing to be inducted.
He is sentenced to five years in prison and fined $10,000.
The way he fused politics and sports...
Very few black athletes had ever talked the way Muhammad Ali talked without fear of something happening to them in their career.
...status as a Black Muslim minister made him exempt from the draft.
He was already very unpopular with mainstream Americans because he had joined an organization known as the Nation of Islam, which was perceived as a radical black separatist group.
And then on top of that, when he was called for induction and refused to take the step forward, he absolutely infuriated America.
Muhammad Ali said,
"No Viet Cong ever called me nigger."
The king is going home to get his throne.
From the root to the fruit.
That's where everything started at.
This is God's act, and you a part of it.
This is no Hollywood set. This is real.
Hollywood come in and take these kind of scenes and set 'em up, have somebody in the movies playing his life.
This is real. We don't pick up a script.
We get up in the morning feeling tired.
Sometimes we feel good, sometimes bad.
- But we go through it with feeling.
- Time!
Muhammad Ali were born to do it.
He's a prophet. He gonna be a fisherman for Elijah Muhammad.
This is only a stop, look and listen sign he's doing, fighting.
We've been fightin' ever since we even met.
We beat Uncle Sam. Three and a half years.
Come out of the garage and beat number two.
First man ever did it. The rest of 'em they put out of the country.
This is God's act. We just actors in it.
If Jesus was here, everybody would want his autograph, and if films was around when he was around, they'd be filming him.
The only thing, this is a sport.
That's why you walking, talk to him.
I think Muhammad is a prophet.
How you gonna beat God's son?
Anybody who loves poor people and little people gotta be a prophet.
He was champion of the world, had a long table full of food.
Had a house for his mother, one for him, and he told 'em to take it and shove it.
If he couldn't love his god, what do you think he is... mister?
Get it together!
Get it together! Get it together!
Ali trained for the fight with Foreman at Deer Lake, Pennsylvania.
He trained very hard for that fight...
- One more.
- ...and had very good sparring partners.
Larry Holmes was one of his sparring partners.
I was struck with how well, uh, he handled... he'd actually handled Ali in their sparring sessions.
He'd dominated Ali. That wasn't uncommon.
Ali very often would not show his best stuff with his sparring partners, but in fact would work on his weaknesses.
He'd go against the ropes, and he'd let people pummel him.
Heavy hitters who were sort of clumsy, he'd let them bang away at him.
It was as if he wanted to train his body to receive these messages of punishment and absorb them faster than other fighters could absorb them.
True significance of why this fight's being fought in Africa is because they came up with $10 million.
Five million dollars for George Foreman, five million dollars for me.
London, England, was trying to get it.
A promoter said
America were trying to get it.
But none of them could surpass the $5 million mark.
The dream is now becoming a reality.
Don King went to George Foreman and got Foreman to sign an option agreement saying that if King could deliver $5 million,
Foreman would fight Ali.
Then King went to Ali and made the same deal with him.
So Don King now had both fighters, their signatures on a piece of paper.
What he didn't have was $10 million.
...a festival that will complement this great sporting event, the greatest sporting event in the history of the world.
- Greatest of all time!
- Of all time, as the champ says.
- The greatest event of all time!
- With some...
Bigger than Evel Knievel and the Kentucky Derby on the same day.
The president of Zaire was willing to put $10 million of his country's own very scarce, hard-earned currency on the line, not for any short-term economic reason but because he felt that the fight would be good in terms of promoting Zaire and also in terms of promoting himself.
And as Ali said at the time, countries go to war to get their names on the map, and wars cost a lot more than $10 million.
Some of the most dynamic performers from Afro-America will be appearing down there at the stadium in Kinshasa on the 20th, the 21st and the 22nd, along with the world, and with its theatrical release.
It will be James Brown, who is soul brother number one,
- one of our top, leading black artists.
- Is he coming?
Yes,
James Brown will be there performing.
We will have BB King, the Spinners...
This is the first assembly in the history of all America where all the top-notch blacks of America and the people of Africa had something together, all on the world level.
We're all meeting each other and learning more about each other.
It's the first assembly among American black men and Africans like us in the history of the world.
And it's a big honor to be part of that.
Plus I gotta whup George!
Got to whup George!
We're gonna rumble in the jungle!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Speak to 'em. Go ahead.
Good boy. Get down.
- Back. You're good.
- George?
Is this fight against Ali will be the toughest of your career, you think?
Could be. Could be. I doubt it.
This is Muhammad Ali,
September 10, at New York City Airport en route to Zaire to reclaim the heavyweight title of the world.
Champ, what would you like to say to the children of the world?
I'd like to tell the children of the world, mainly right here where they speak and understand English in America, to live a clean life.
Stay off of dope.
It's tearing the country up.
Also, if they want to be like me,
I'm getting ready to whup George Foreman, and by the time they see this,
I will have beaten him.
Tell them to quit eating so much candy.
I have three rotten teeth. They're bad, and I had to have one of 'em pulled.
I can't chew my food like I should.
Eat natural foods because we must whup Mr. Tooth Decay.
I got one right there and one right here.
Yesterday Ali told us that he's going to use part of his money for the building of a hospital.
Do you intend yourself to use part of your money for something?
Have you got a project?
He may think he may have to be in the hospital.
I want the man!
Yeah, when I get to Africa, we gonna get it on because we don't get along!
I don't like him. He talks too much.
Beg your pardon?
You would continue boxing even if you would lose over there?
I beg your pardon?
You don't think about losing?
No. Thank you. Nice talking with you.
Flying over the Sahara Desert on an African airline with all African stewardesses, all African pilots.
Boy, this is the first free feeling
I've had in a long time.
Ain't this something, flying in an airplane with all black pilots?
- All black crew?
- Crazy!
This is strange to the American Negro.
We never dreamed of this.
And every time we watch television, they show us Tarzan and the natives and the jungles.
They never told us that the Africans were more intelligent than we are.
They speak English...
They speak English, French and African.
We can't even speak English good.
Ain't this beautiful? I'm free!
Fantastic!
I'm free.
Now, I want everybody to repeat after me.
If you don't know who you are and where your place in life is,
- just say to yourself, I am!
- I am!
- Somebody!
- Somebody!
- I am!
- I am!
- Somebody!
- Somebody!
- I may be poor.
- I may be poor.
- But I am.
- But I am.
Somebody.
It was a great joy to see that the championship was going to happen in Africa.
People were so happy.
At last, the world was paying attention to our continent.
Yes, we knew Muhammad Ali as a boxer, but more importantly for his political stance.
When we saw that America was at war in a third-world country, Vietnam... and that one of the children of the United States said, "Me?
You want me to go and fight against the Viet Cong?
Why should I fight against them?
They haven't done anything against me."
And for us, it was extraordinary to see that in the America of that time, someone could take such a position.
He may have lost his title, he may have lost millions of dollars, but that's where he gained the esteem of millions of Africans.
Ali! Ali! Ali!
Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!
What is... What is your population?
- Twenty-two million.
- Twenty-two million?
- Twenty-two million.
- How many George Foreman fans here?
We don't know, we don't know.
- How many Muhammad Ali?
- There are so many we cannot count them.
George Foreman?
We didn't know who he was.
We had heard that he was a world champion.
We thought he was white.
Then we realized he was black, like Muhammad Ali.
But still, for us,
Foreman represented America.
He arrived with a dog, a German shepherd, which immediately offended Africans, since the Belgians had used shepherds as police dogs.
Ali said that he's the hometown fighter and you're the out-of-towner here.
Africa is the cradle of civilization.
Everybody's home is Africa.
Okay, fine. So they're leaving tomorrow.
Typhoid. How do you spell "typhoid"?
Is that all that we're giving?
Who do you want to be your beneficiary in case of anything.
And then sign it.
You need an actual airline ticket to get on this plane.
Let me see some hands of the 51 who don't have tickets.
Who doesn't have an airline ticket?
Hi!
You know who we are, don't you?
I'm Lola Love, and I'm one of the dancers with the James Brown show... revue.
"Zai-ere," or "Zare," or whatever you... you know.
Yeah, man.
When are gonna get to Zee-air?
- To who?
- Mobutu land.
To Zee-air?
We're gonna fly in zee-air till we get to Zaire.

So you don't have to have those trucks out to the airport that early.
They told me
James Brown's gonna be here.
- James Brown is on his way.
- BB King's gonna be here.
And I showed up, and they ain't nowhere around.
Sixth, fifth and fourth are done.

It's all in, but it doesn't work.

On what floors though?
I have sixth, fifth and fourth.
I understand that, but what about, um...
It's individual air conditioning controls, and they have circuit breakers...

Of course, the fight was held in Zaire, the former Belgian Congo.
Kinshasa was the capital, on the banks of the Congo.
It was just before the rainy season when this fight took place.
Off to the north you could see the flickering of storms, uh, coming closer and closer, and it was important to the promoters that this fight get in before the storms occurred, because once the rainy season comes, you can't do anything.
I always thought the Congo had such a wonderful name...
Conradian and all that.
Somehow to call it Zaire didn't have quite the majesty.
But there it was, the Congo.
Mobutu was everywhere.
He was the equivalent in Africa of Joseph Stalin.
You saw his picture everywhere.
And of course, part of the vanity of dictators, they almost always...
With the possible exception of Mussolini, who was half ugly and half attractive, most dictators are unbelievably ugly or plain.
Franco, Hitler.
Mobutu looked the archetype.
He was the epitome of a closet sadist.
Sort of guy, if you meet him in a bar, you think, "Oh, my God.
Who are the poor women who are associated with this fella?"
And since Mobutu was an extraordinarily practical man for his country, down under the stadium, which seated 100,000 people, were detention pens and rooms and chambers where you could imprison as many as a couple thousand people at once.
Before the fight came, the criminal rate in Zaire began to go up, and a few white foreigners had been killed driving their cars.
And Mobutu decided that this was going to be a disaster in terms of publicity, so on a given day, he had a thousand of the leading criminals in Kinshasa rounded up and put in this stadium, down in the detention pens.
And then, the legend has it, and I suspect the legend may even be true, that he had a hundred of them taken at random and killed them.
And the reason was a particularly simple one from Mobutu's point of view:
Criminals who make a life out of it have connections that protect them when they're in trouble, and by making this kill of a hundred out of a thousand arbitrarily, what Mobutu was saying is,
"Your connections are worth nothing.
I am Jehovah.
I am going to blast you out of existence if you fool around with me."
And he made his point.
Kinshasa was one of the safest cities not only in all of Africa but probably in all of the world while the foreign press was there for the fight.
To me, the drum has been the communicator since the beginning of time.
I'm sure it was the first message ever sent.
When I think of the beat today and I think of the beats centuries ago, it's the only thing that kept us together.
We had this thing, when we hurt, we sung for trial and tribulation, we sung for relief, we sung songs of God, and this music that you hear today is the same songs that have been made popular throughout the world without anybody's intentions or volition.
Oh!
So I would say that anybody who knows anything about the rhythm and the blues, as they're so-called today, should know about Africa.

The great place to visit in Kinshasa was a compound about 20 miles up the Congo River, a place called Nsele, which was a presidential palace.
That was where we saw Foreman, who seemed incredible.
I'd seen him fight before.
I saw him destroy Frazier.
I'd never seen destruction like that, and the thing I always remembered was that the beaten fighter, even a man as powerful and big as Frazier... and he was very much favored to win that... suddenly becomes about the size of a Pygmy.
They just diminish in size.
And Foreman suddenly became this gigantic figure.
And he had a trainer, Dick Sadler, tiny by comparison to Foreman, and Sadler would hang on to the heavy bag.
But Foreman would hit this... this bag...
Sadler would just literally be picked off his feet.
Foreman hitting the heavy bag is one of the more prodigious sights
I've had in my life.
It seems to me that of all the people
I've seen hitting heavy bags, including Sonny Liston, no one ever hit it the way Foreman did.
At the end of 15 minutes of pounding the heavy bag, there'd be a hole in the heavy bag... not a hole, but a huge dent the size of half a small watermelon in that tremendous heavy bag, and Foreman used to use the biggest heavy bag around.
What would be interesting is Ali, who would train after Foreman, would often pass by this large hall where the training took place, and he never looked at Foreman hitting the heavy bag.
He just walked right by as if Foreman did not exist.
And it was significant because if you were gonna fight the man, you did not want to see him hitting that heavy bag.
I'm a speed demon! I'm a brain fighter!
I'm scientific! I'm artistic!
I plan my strategy!
He's the bull! I'm the matador!
He's scared to death.
He's scared to death!
He wish he could get out of the whole thing!
He wish he could get out of the whole thing when I look at him.
The man is frightened!
He's meetin' his master, his teacher, his idol!
- Time!
- Is that all?
When I talk and work, I'm in shape.
It's all I do.
Ali had announced he was gonna dance.
He spoke about it all the time.
You couldn't do an interview with Ali during that period where he would say,
"How is Foreman going to get near to me?
I'm going to dance.
I'm going to dance and dance.
That man will look foolish trying to find me.
And as he gropes his way forward in this storm of blindness that's the speed of my dancing,
I will strike him with my jab.
Poo! Poo! Poo!" he would go, and so forth.
We heard this over and over and over, and Foreman heard it too.
Foreman was working now on what's called cutting off the ring.
Now, cutting off the ring essentially just means cornering your opponent against the ropes or in a corner.
And it's an art. It's a balletic art.
You have to have very good footwork.
Foreman's footwork...
He was a big, powerful man, but his footwork was better than anyone expected.
He worked with very fast fighters, smaller than himself, who certainly could dance, and he worked on cornering them.
And he was very good. And we'd watch this.
And the combination of hitting the heavy bag and watching Foreman cut off the ring made most of the fight writers, myself included, terribly pessimistic about Ali's chances.
Yeah, Lord. Now you're working.
The guy threw up his elbows to protect himself from Foreman, and Foreman walked into his elbow.
And he got cut...
That's how he got cut in the eye?
What else can happen that hasn't happened yet?
I saw the man's cut, and this man cannot fight.
This man cannot fight for the world championship.
- You are not a doctor.
- I don't give a damn.
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
The Zaireans kicked us out, and they did not want us around.
And they want the fight to go on.
That's all there is to it.
- That's the problem.
- He won't fight with that eye.
- He's not that dumb.
- He's not that dumb.
That's all you want is a fight.
That's all you want.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
That's all you want is a fight. I know.
I respectfully ask, are the fighters remaining here because they want to remain here, or has the government requested they remain?
Uh, Mr. Sadler told me to convey to the press that it's nothing but an accident.
It's not serious.
They will be getting in touch with the promoters of the fight, and it's possible that we may have to delay the fight, and he will let the press know as soon as possible.
Did they have to stitch Foreman?
They had to stitch him.
Holy shit, man.
So how long is the delay, man?
It'll take another day or two to give any intelligence.
This just happened yesterday.
Then after, we can make a decision.
How does George feel about it?
Well, like anybody else. He's only human.
How would any individual feel?
Does he want to go ahead, or does he want it postponed?
Who? Why should he?
- Why should he go ahead with it, or...
- Why should he make any decision?
Who would know what another man thinks?
How could I truthfully tell you what you would think or what I would think, or how...
A man may have mixed emotions,
I don't know. I couldn't speak for George.
I can only speak for Dick Sadler, not for somebody else.
It would be hard.
I'm not that intelligent.
I don't have that knowledge, that ability to speak what's in another man's mind.
He never discussed it to me, what his thoughts are.
And a person's mind change from time to time.
- But the decision is yours to make?
- The decision is mine to make.
And right now I haven't made any...
I don't have any decisions to make.
Okay, let's get the show on the road.
This meeting is now called to order.
Hear, hear.
The delay won't have any, uh... any effect on the fight at all.
There hasn't been...
There will not be a delay.
The fight will be rescheduled, but when it happens, it'll be actually intended for that time.
Fate intended it for another time.
There is no delay.
How does Ali feel about it?
And if there ever has been any disappointments in sports, any setbacks or rainy days that stopped a ball game, anything, this is the worst of all time.
Initially, Muhammad went through a pretty bad couple of hours, and he first wanted to move the whole fight back to the United States, and when he was told that wouldn't work, he said,
"Well, then let's bring Joe Frazier over here, and I'll fight him again, and instead of each of us getting $5 million,
I'll take 3 million and Joe can take 1 million."
But after a while he calmed down, and he realized that there was nothing that could be done about it except stay in Zaire an extra six weeks and make the best of it.
Now I gotta wait. He's gonna get his whuppin', but I just have to wait.
Boy, I was ready!
I was gonna upset the world again!
The whole world was gonna crawl and bow the next morning!
I was gonna defeat that big, indestructible George Foreman!
Gonna rip him up!
I was gonna get him for a sparring partner.
My dream's all messed up for six more weeks.
The man's in trouble! The man is scared!
He's in my country to start with!
He's in my country. You wanna see?
Want me to show you this is my country?

And I'm gonna... Ooh!
I'm tired. I can't take it no more.
Let me get out of here.
I gotta get out of here.

The black acts in America have not learned that once their records is off the charts, they're finished.
I mean, they haven't... they haven't learned that.
It's so true.
I heard a speech by Jesse Jackson, saying we must recognize that we're only useful as long as we're necessary.
As long as you're necessary.
When we're not necessary, we're no longer useful,
So they don't realize that your strength comes from your community.
And you have to deal from your strength.
You have to, because in dealing from your strength, you've got somebody.
So if somebody grabs James Brown or want to hurt James Brown, somebody gonna raise their voice and say,
"Why are you bothering my brother?"
Because he's got some soldiers around, somebody that's concerned, that cares.
But when you're dealing as an individual, no matter how big you get, as a black individual, you still a nigger.
You don't care how much money you get.
You are still a nigger.
When you start that by yourself, you are all alone when you become unnecessary.

We left Africa in shackles and fetters and chains.
We're coming back in an aura of splendor and scintillating glory.
The champions are here. So we try to get the champions of the sports world, champions of the music world.
We put 'em together, and we got one champion that's so intermingled and intertwined that we're fused into one entity.
The brother said something there!
Yeah, the brother said something there.
Don King put this together.
It was not a color put it together.
You understand?
I'd like to call him the messiah.
This fight came into existence because of Don King's desire to be famous, to break out of the pack.
It was the world to him. He was either going to become enormously prominent, at the least, in American life, or he was going to go back to obscurity again if it failed.
Oh, I'm so happy to see you, my brother.
Oh, good.
- This is the minister of finance.
- We met before.
Yes, I have met the minister of finance.
How are you?
I recognize and appreciate your talent and your expertise.
This is what it's all about. I welcome you with love. That's all I'm saying.
We must deal with it as such, but with love, you know?
Not with hostility and alienation.
You know? But with love.
Bravo, Mr. King! Bravo!
King had this huge air of welcome.
Rarely has anyone ever been welcomed the way King could do it for you.
There was a joy that came off him.
I knew his reputation, all about him, how he'd been in jail, how he was thoroughly untrustworthy and so forth, but nonetheless, what it was is, he made you feel good.
Don't leave me. I need you.
I need your strength.
He was a startling-looking man.
All the writers used to find different ways of describing this great up-brush of hair.
Some people would say that he'd stuck his thumb into an electric socket.
Falling through an empty elevator shaft.
The fight, of course, was postponed, and Don King turned up, and everybody wanted to know what was going on.
It looked as though maybe the fight wasn't going to happen, and...
Nothing that's as big as this ever runs smoothly anyway.
Anything worthwhile is worth fighting for.
So we have a situation here where we have been struck with adversity.
If you think about what Shakespeare said:
"The sweet uses of adversity, ugly and venomous like the toad, yet wears a precious jewel in his head."
- "Venomous like a..."
- "Ugly and venomous like a toad, yet wears a precious jewel in his head."
How many fight promoters have even tried one line of Shakespeare?
He had a whole raft of them.
I can relate to the denial that they have to be confronted with.
I can relate to the rat-infested hovels, the substandard tenements, the overcrowded tenements.
I can relate to these things because I've been a part of them.
I know about roaches, about rats, so when he started talkin' to me about it,
I can understand him and he can understand me.
You understand? So it's a big difference.
So when I do the thing he can understand, so now he will believe in me because he feels that he has...
I have shared with him the same anguish and anxiety, the same pain that he has felt.
Big difference.
What would happen if you took an enormous... not an enormous, but a small part of the vast sums of money that'll be made out of the fight and put it into something that was... that would help a number of people rather than a few?
This is what my dream and desire is, and I feel that I would need... white counterparts to do this here.
I would say, let me engender a large amount of money, if it's possible, and then don't let this money just be sitting there so that it would wither away and just die, but put it into the sun, so it could be exposed, so it could germinate, blossom and grow.
He's really quite a remarkable man.
Don King is one of the brightest people
I've ever met, he's one of the most charismatic people
I've ever met, he's one of the hardest working people
I've ever met.
He is also totally amoral, and I can't think of a man who has done more to demoralize fighters, exploit from fighters, and ruin fighters' careers than Don King.
But you have to give him his due for what he did to make Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman in Zaire.
And nobody does anything for nothing.
You understand that?
Fight or no fight, what business are we in?
- We're in the music business.
- I was starting to wonder, man.
Because I feel like we're in the fight business these days.

We were all for Muhammad Ali.
Foreman? We didn't know him.
Foreman said, "Why?
I'm black, blacker than Muhammad Ali.
Why all this bias?"
Yes, Muhammad Ali, he was lighter, but he was a real person.
He was genuine.
Muhammad Ali could have been even lighter-skinned than he was, but for us, he was defending the good cause, for Africans and the whole world.
Watch this. Seven punches.
I'm gonna fight for the prestige, not for me but to uplift my little brothers who are sleeping on concrete floors today in America.
Black people who are living on welfare, black people who can't eat, black people who don't know no knowledge of themselves, black people who don't have no future.
I want to win my title and walk down the alleys, sit on the garbage can with the wine-heads.
I want to walk down the street with the dope addicts, talk to the prostitutes.
So I can help a lot of people.
I can show 'em films,
I can take this documentary,
I can take movies and help uplift my people in Louisville, Kentucky;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Cincinnati, Ohio.
I can go throughout Tennessee and Florida and Mississippi and show black Africans in them countries who didn't know this was their country,
"You look like people in Mississippi, in Alabama, in Georgia.
They're your brothers, but they never knew you was over here, and you don't know much about them."
God is blessing me, as an accident through boxing, to help get to all these people and show them films I haven't seen!
I know they haven't seen 'em.
I'm worldly, and I haven't seem 'em!
Now I can get all these films.
You governments can let me take pictures.
You can let me do things, and I can take all this back to America!
But... it's good to be a winner.
All I've got to do is whup George Foreman.
And I realize how unfortunate and how uncomfortable it is for some of you guys to have traveled so far and expecting so much and getting so little.
George Foreman was a phenomenon.
He was almost like a physical guru.
He almost never said anything, but when he did, it was arresting.
You never quite knew what he was talking about.
It might be deep.
It might be non-responsive.
He was negritude.
He was this huge black force.
And because of this, I had expected
Muhammad Ali to be here today.
I was gonna immediately jump and hit him in his mouth to give you some form of entertainment.
Now when I go in the ring, you see what kind of mind I got now?
Oh! Oh!
I just got to pound now.
I mean, I've got to pound it.
I'm not gonna even realize until after.
I might look at his face, say,
"How did I do that?"
Allah, God. I'm his tool.
God got in me on purpose.
This is for my people.
This man look slow. God has made this man look like a little kid.
A so-called right hand ain't nothing now.
I don't even feel 'em.
I ain't got no fear of it.
I walk right in. I'm gonna take my shots.
Because I got God in my mind.
I'm thinking of my people being free.
And I can help with just one fight.
Now he look little in comparison to what
I'm getting from it. He ain't nothin' now.
But if I think about me, just me, and...
George Foreman knocked out
Joe Frazier like he was God.
George Foreman knocked out Ken Norton.
And the white press, the power structure, rank me to get tired in five or six.
Then I go in like Norton and the rest of 'em and get scared.
But I'm not looking at the world and what they say. My God controls the universe.
I was very interested in people called féticheurs.
They are witches, soothsayers, and in Western Africa, almost everybody has one.
Like a witch doctor, and you go the way we would go to a dentist.
Muhammad Ali had been to Mobutu's féticheur.
And, uh... he had said that... the féticheur had said that a woman with trembling hands would somehow get to Foreman.
A succubus.
And that impressed me enormously.
That's the way I confuse that sucker!
The heavyweight championship does produce an excitement in the onlookers that's unlike almost any other spectacle.
It's almost physically unendurable to wait for that bell to ring for the first round.
In 1974 in Zaire, the fight started at 4:00 in the morning, in order that it could be shown on television in America at a reasonable hour like 10:00.
Before the fight,
I saw a scene that was incomparable.
Ali's dressing room was like a morgue.
It was like The Last Supper.
And at a certain point, Ali said...
"Why is everyone... so unhappy?
What is the matter with all of you?"
The sense was, was that we were watching a man who was going out to be... going out to the gallows.
Because they all believed that he was gonna get defeated, and they were terrified.
They thought that, with his pride, he would take one of the world's worst beatings ever, and he wouldn't give up, and he was gonna be destroyed in that ring.
Killed or maimed, or they knew not what.
But they were deeply frightened now.
It was as if they were taking whatever fear Ali might have had before this enormous confrontation, and they were absorbing it.
So after a while, he looked at Bundini and said,
"We're gonna dance tonight, aren't we?
We're gonna dance."
When they said, "You're gonna dance," he said, "I'm gonna dance."
Muhammad Ali was so funny, gracious, repeating this.
"What am I gonna do?"
And they said, "You're gonna dance!"
He said, "Yes! I'm gonna dance and dance!
And that man's gonna be bewildered!
I'm gonna dance and dance!"
And they said, "You're gonna dance!"
And I swear they were all crying.
And he built them up to a degree so that for him they became half-happy.
And here comes the Ali people out of the dressing room, and all of the questions will be answered.
This is an awesome power of George Foreman against the venerated boxing skills of Muhammad Ali.
It's age against youth.
The experience of Muhammad Ali against the youth and brute force and blinding speed.
You can hear the band beginning to strike up in the background as Ali moves to the ring.
This is what Muhammad Ali lives for.
This is the man's life.
This may be an historic event,
Muhammad Ali coming into the boxing ring for the last time.
Should Muhammad Ali retire, this will be, what you're seeing now, a very historic event.
Now here comes the heavyweight champion of the world, George Foreman, jogging out.
George Foreman, decked out in his red robe, coming in with his people.
No one in the press ever saw Mobutu, and he didn't come to the fight.
He watched the fight on closed-circuit.
It was the only closed-circuit in Zaire, and it was in his palace.
He was terribly afraid of assassination,
I think.
Now, this stadium was a true arena for gladiators.
Its floor, the floor you could not see beneath the floor, was covered with blood.
That blood had been washed away, but the effect of the blood was still there as part of the atmosphere.
There was a lot of talk about the possibility of rain.
I don't think the weather could be any more beautiful than it is tonight.
And Ali is getting the people to chant,
"Ali, bomaye."
That means "Ali, kill him."
The atmosphere before the bell rang, before that first round, was as intense as any I ever recall.
Look at this now, as they stare.
Muhammad Ali beginning to talk to George Foreman.
They're really putting the stare on each other.
George Foreman has that serious look.
Ali definitely talking to him.
Look at the stare on George Foreman.
Look at Ali give him the word.
So the stage is set.
We're just about ready to begin round one.
This time, the championship is at stake, and $5 million will be paid to both fighters.
Ali ready, Foreman ready.
We're waiting for the opening bell.
Here we go. Ali quickly across the ring.
Round one. Ali bouncing around, shifting left to right.
George moves slow.
Ali gets the first punch in.
A light right hand taken on the forehead by George Foreman, the champion.
Foreman moving slow, trying to stalk his man.
Ali looks like he's ready to go here.
He's not staying away.
He's going after his man.
Foreman a bit cautious in the first round, looking to drop that left hook.
Foreman's locked his man to the far corner.
There's that left uppercut and jab to the body of Muhammad Ali.
Ali tries to hang on to the head of George Foreman.
Foreman dances now.
Ali with a right-hand lead again!
Has Foreman slightly confused with that right-hand lead, which I haven't seen too many times before.
A right-hand lead, which means that you throw your right without countering...
You throw it first, like a jab, but you throw it like... there... that has to travel that extra distance across the shoulders.
Professionals will very rarely use a right-hand lead
'cause it's a terribly dangerous punch to throw, since you are open to a counter with a left hook.
And fighters, since they work in milliseconds, can see a right coming much faster than a jab.
Nobody had thrown a right-hand lead at Foreman in two years, and in training camp none of his sparring partners, for $50 a day, was gonna start throwing right-hand leads at him because it's a great insult to a top professional when you throw a right-hand lead at him.
It suggests he's slow enough that you can hit him with it.
And instead Ali figured out the one punch Foreman's not prepared for is a right-hand lead.
"He's expecting me to dance.
I'm not gonna dance.
I'm gonna hit him with a right hand, knock him out in the first round."
Ali threw 12 right-hand leads.
I don't think he had told anyone he was gonna do it.
He may have debated about whether he was going to do it up till the last moment.
The only thing is, he didn't knock
Foreman down and didn't knock him out.
Instead, Foreman went crazy.
That punch did no damage. That one did!
Two wild right hands taken on the side of the head of Muhammad Ali!
There's a real strong right hand just underneath the heart.
And Muhammad Ali is taking some punishment now.
About eight seconds left in the round.
Bell rang.
Ali went back to the corner.
Finally, the nightmare he'd been awaiting in the ring had finally come to visit him.
He was in the ring with a man he could not dominate, who was stronger than him, who was not afraid of him, who was gonna try to knock him out, and who punched harder than Ali could punch, and this man was determined and unstoppable.
And Ali had a look on his face that I'll never forget.
It's the only time
I ever saw fear in Ali's eyes.
Ali looked as if he looked into himself and said,
"All right, this is the moment.
This is what you've been waiting for.
This is... that hour.
And do you have the guts?"
And he kind of nodded to himself, like,
"Got to get it together, boy.
You really got to get it together.
And you are gonna get it together.
You will get it together."
He nodded some more, as if he were looking into the eyes of his maker, and then turned to the crowd, and he went,
"Ali, bomaye!"
And a hundred thousand people all yelled back "Ali, bomaye!"
And this huge reverberation of the crowd came back into the ring, and Ali picked it up almost as if,
"These are my people.
This is what I'm here for.
All right. The time has come.
I'm gonna find a way to master this man."
Ali tries to tie him up.
No real damage done in that exchange.
Foreman, like everyone else, had assumed that Ali would dance, and so Ali now went to the ropes and went into the rope-a-dope.
And a lot of people thought at that moment the fight was over.
Especially on television, where they saw it, because it looked like Foreman was now killing a very weak Ali.
You don't go to the ropes.
And there he was, leaning way back.
I wrote about it as if...
I think the phrase I used was,
"It was like a man leaning out a window trying to see if there's something on his roof."
And, you know...
But you couldn't really see.
Here were these great broadsides going at him, and it looked as though he was being set up for the kill.
It happened so quickly and so abruptly that I said, I shouted to Norman,
"The fix is in."
That somehow he's supposed to go down in the first or the second.
Ropes is halfway house to the floor.
It just looked as though he had to cave in.
...awkward but very powerful hooks with both hands.
Left hooks in what would really be...
They became so basic at that point that they were like two kids having a fight.
And for that round and for the next round and for the next round,
Ali lay against the ropes in the rope-a-dope, and he kept talking to Foreman, and it was extraordinary.
You had to be close to see it,
'cause it was intimate.
And Foreman was throwing these prodigious punches that the sparring partners had thrown, and Ali swung like a man in the rigging.
He'd go all the way back, slide out, come in and out like that.
Occasionally he'd get hit, and he'd say,
"George, you disappoint me.
You don't hit as hard as I thought you would.
George, you're not hitting hard enough.
You're not breaking popcorn, George.
You're just not hitting."
And Foreman's insane with rage and wanging at him and wanging at him and wanging at him.
Powerful, powerful, powerful.
And middle of the fifth round,
Foreman was worn out.
He had punched himself out.
It had taken three rounds.
Ali picks it up a bit.
About 40 seconds left in round five.
Good, crisp combination by Ali lands on the head of Foreman.
Foreman with that right hook.
Ali scores a hook!
Quick jab with the right backs up Foreman!
Backs him up in his tracks!
Foreman's stunned here!
Foreman tries the hook!
Ali goes to the right!
Foreman gets knocked to the left!
Foreman hit again!
Foreman has been hit three or four times!
Suddenly Muhammad Ali came off the ropes, and he hit him a right, and you could see the sweat just pour off, just like a fountain, come off Foreman's face, and you suddenly realized there was design in this madness.
I then turned to Norman, I remember, and he must've been somewhat puzzled, but I said, "The succubus has got him," referring back to this woman with the trembling hands that I'd been told by the witch doctors was going to touch Foreman and destroy him.
This could be the tactics of Ali, to let the man punch himself out.
Thirty seconds left in round eight.
A very even fight.
Ali, a sneaky right hand.
Another sneaky right hand.
This time he works over the shoulder of Foreman.
This is the combination!
Two, three, four, five, six!
Foreman gets up to the knee at eight!
That's it! The fight is stopped!
Muhammad Ali, a dramatic eighth-round knockout!
He knocks out...
George Foreman!
He's done it!
Muhammad Ali has done it!
Muhammad Ali has done it!
Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali.
Muhammad Ali, he was like a sleeping elephant.
You can do whatever you want around a sleeping elephant.
Whatever you want.
But when he wakes up, he tramples everything.
Muhammad Ali, bomaye.
Bomaye. Muhammad Ali bomaye
George Foreman.
He did it.
He's champion again.
We couldn't believe it.
It was such a classic performance, and so beautiful, that at the moment
Ali hit the knockout punch...
Foreman began to go,
Ali followed him around.
Ali had his right cocked for one more punch, but he never threw it.
He didn't want to ruin the aesthetic of this man going down with a clumsy punch on the way down.
I think one has mixed emotions when you see the end of a fight.
I always feel enormous sympathy for the man that's losing it.
You just can't help but to, particularly when you see really a titanic, formidable figure just suddenly on the ground.
And now, when we see George on television... and know that after that knockout, he went through two years of the deepest depression, he almost didn't come out of it.
To see the man who's come out of it, to see the way in which he reconstructed his personality, until it'll be hard-put to find anyone in American life who's more affable than George Foreman.
Foreman has become a fabulous person in American life.
Just as the fight finished, the monsoons, the African rains, came, and in fact they came so hard that the waters were about three feet deep in the dressing rooms, where we'd just been, you know, an hour ago.
You've never seen such a downpour.
And we rode back through the African night from the boxing ring into Kinshasa, and there were crowds along the road standing in the rain, in this pouring rain, leaping up and down, because of course the news had gone around that Muhammad Ali had won this fight.
He stayed up all night, from what I heard, and in the morning he spoke to African groups who'd come as delegations to see him.
And they more than revered him.
He was a god.
And he spoke to them very simply that day, and beautifully, and he said,
"Afro-Americans, in America, we're not as good as you are.
Some of us are richer than you are, but you have a dignity in your poverty that we don't have.
We are spoiled in America.
We have lost what you still have in Africa, and you must keep that."
And he spoke very gently. And I thought,
"My Lord, on top of everything else, this man is a political leader, and he's gonna be a great political leader."
I have a lot of things to do in the black neighborhoods.
We have a lot of problems that we have to solve among ourselves.
Prostitution problems, dope problems, gang-fight problems.
Knowledge of self. The black people don't have no knowledge of themselves.
We have been made just like white people mentally.
And white people have made us so much like them until it's hard to teach them anything about themselves.
It's hard to teach them to unite and marry and be with their own because they're now like white people... black people are now like white people.
But they're so brainwashed that we have to re-brainwash 'em now and teach 'em more about themselves and their own history, their own names, their own language, to respect and protect their own women, do something for themselves and quit always begging white people for things they should do for themselves.
I never heard Ali say that he was never gonna fight again.
Uh... if he had said it, and usually he told the truth, I wouldn't have believed it.
He was born to fight, born for the ring, and loved it.
He truly loved fighting. And, uh... as happens with people who love a thing too much, it destroys them.
I think it was Oscar Wilde that said,
"You destroy the thing that you love."
It's the other way around.
What you love destroys you.
He came back. He had 22 fights.
Some of them were most honorable.
Some were very difficult.
Some of them were comedies and farces.
He hurt himself in those 22 fights after the fight in Africa.
There's a tendency to look at Muhammad and say,
"He's wounded. He's ill."
There are no intellectual deficits.
It's a motor-skills problem.
And he doesn't try to hide his condition.
He goes out and lets the whole world see it.
He doesn't feel sorry for himself, and there's really no reason for anybody else to feel sorry for him.
He loves being Muhammad Ali.
He truly believes that he's doing God's work, and he's as happy with each day as anybody I know.
Today's young generation, they don't know anything.
Something happened last year, they know nothing about it.
So there are these great, great stories, great historic events, and I'm not talking about 1850s stuff.
They don't know who Malcolm X is.
They don't know who JFK is.
Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson, you can go down the line.
And-And it's scary.
These kids today will be missing a whole lot if they don't know about the legacy of Muhammad Ali, because no matter what era you live in, you see very few true heroes.
Ali, bomaye! Ali, bomaye!
Ali, bomaye! Ali, bomaye!
Back up, sucker. Back up.
Come get me, sucker. I'm dancin'!
I'm dancin'! Follow me, chump!
No, I'm not there, I'm here. Whoop!
Sucker, you ain't got nothing!

Years after the fight in Zaire, perhaps ten years after... and I'd run into Ali on occasion after that, but I remember this meeting particularly.
'Cause Esquire was giving a party for various people who had distinguished themselves in
Esquire that year in one way or another.
Ali, for whatever he'd done.
I was there probably 'cause I had a good story in Esquire that year.
Other people were there, maybe 25 of us, honored guests.
I was there with my wife, and we saw Ali, and we were talking with him, and he couldn't have been nicer, more complimentary.
I remember I was 62 at the time,
'cause he said, "How old are you now?"
I said "62." He said "Oh."
It was the same as when we were running, jogging that night.
He said, "Oh, I hope I'm as young as you are when I'm 62.
You are looking wonderful."
He went on and on like that.
And I got so pleased and so vain that, you know, I'm like a dog.
What did I have to do?
I had to go urinate.
And I did. I went away, and the moment I was gone, he turned to my wife, who's much younger than I am, and he looked at her, looked at her hard, and he said,
"You still with that old man?"
And for me that's always been...
That's Ali.
You love him even when you turn your back on him.
I heard him once talking to the Harvard senior class commencement.
He gave this extraordinary speech.
You know, he was dyslexic.
And he would look at a paper with me, and he'd say,
"Hey, George, what's this word?"
I'd say, "Appendicitis."
He'd say, "How do you get a word like 'appendicitis'? It's so long.
It's so long."
Here he was, teaching... uh, delivering a lecture, senior class day for these thousand,
2,000 Harvard graduates... and, um, he had these little cards in front of him.
He gave this wonderful speech about, he hadn't had opportunity, but they had, and they should use that language, that learning that they had to go out and do their best to change the world and make it a better place.
It was moving and it was funny at the same time, and a great roar of appreciation at the end of it, and then... someone shouted out, "Give us a poem!"
And everybody quieted down.
The shortest poem in the English language, according to Bartlett's Quotations, is... it's called
"On the Antiquity of Microbes."
And the poem is, "Adam had 'em."
It's pretty short.
But Muhammad Ali's poem was,
"Me, we."
Two words. I wrote Bartlett's Quotations, and I said,
"Look here. That's shorter than
'Adam had 'em.' You want to put it in?"
And it stands for something more than the poem itself.
"Me, we." What a fighter he was.
And what a man.
I want to win my title and walk down the alleys.

All right, this is what's going on.
Me, O'Bizzle-- O'Bizzle.
- I got it, l got it, man I'm the narrator.
- O'Bizzle fo' shizzle.
Me, Peebs, and Kim.
Kim, you got something to say?
- Yeah, you got something to say.
- Kim?
You all know tonight is going to going to be crazy.
Stupid crazy.
What's your sole mission, O'Byrne?
Man, to keep you out of hand.
You can't-- you can't tame the beast.
Peebs, tell them. How do we roll?
Got 'em. Got 'em.
Tune in next time where we're going to be still loνing life and getting ready to go to war.
- What?
- All right, baby.
- War, Afghanistan, what?
- Say it again, baby, say it again.
- I didn't even sign my passport.
- Baby.
- I didn't even sign my passport.
- We're going to war. We're going to war.
We're going to war. We're going to war.
Roger.
Oh, we're fucking hit.
- This is an lED, over.
- lED.
- Keep going, keep going! Keep--
- What was that?
- Shots.
- Eight o'clock.
- Get on that gun!
- What are we doing?
Aim for that draw! Right now!
That way.
We gotta get out. We gotta get out of here.
We're getting out!
Fucking motherfucker.
Shot, eight o'clock. 300 meters.
Shot, eight o'clock. 102 meters.
You know what?
When they told me
I was going to the Korengal Valley, l really didn't, uh, I didn't read anything up on it. l didn't want to.
I wanted to go in there with an open mind.
The Colonel told me initially they take fire every single day.
I was like, God, how the hell do you take fire every single day from somebody?
You got to go out there and go kill the damn enemy.
Quit being, you know, scared.
Go out there and get 'em.
And the Colonel and I came up with, you know, what we thought was going to be our campaign plan and that, uh, after two months of being there I would fix it and that we wouldn't get shot at anymore.
The very first day, l remember coming in, and one of the pilots and stuff, and they said, hey, if you look over there to your left, uh, that's Pakistan.
You know, and we're like, you know, we all, okay, that's Pakistan.
And then they're all mountains, you know, high elevation.
And as you go in elevation, it starts to get a little bit colder.
And then we go up into the Korengal Valley.
I remember looking out the little bubble windows on the side, kind of just like this, because I was right next to the window.
And I could see when the Chinook had made a hard right turn into the valley.
I was like, holy shit.
We're not ready for this.
We flew around for about half- hour,
45 minutes above the KOP, and you're just looking down there, and you're like, this is in the middle of nowhere right now.
You're away from everything.
Honestly, when I first got to the Korengal,
I was like, this is a shit hole.
My mindset was like, oh snap,
I'm going to die here. l remember getting off the bird and walking up the hill to the hooch.
Hey, Jones, you guys standing up right there, you're wrong.
Come on, guys, better get moving.
And just sucking... and thinking what are we doing?
It started getting dark, and monkeys were howling,
And l thought they were Taliban.
And I thought, holy shit they're close.
Everybody's like, oh, you're going to the Korengal?
And they feel sorry for you and everything like that.
I'm like, dude, it can't be that bad, you know?
I show up there and you're burning your own feces.
You know, you're living in a tent.
I literally lived in a bunker, you know, about that high, I couldn't even stand up in.
See bullet holes all rattled into the Hescos and when you look up, it's like,
I don't even know why I have Hescos here because they're not going to stop the bullets that are coming down from the mountains.
So I felt like l was--
I was like fish in a barrel.
They're gathering intel right now, basically, on how to deal with us, because they haven't-- there's no really research or intel on how to treat us right now, because they haven't had to deal with people like us since World War ll and Vietnam, you know, dealing with guys that are coming back from 15-month deployments with as much fighting, you know, as we went through.
Hey, go on that ridgeline, fucking now!
Hey, roger, I'm up here by OP four.
We're scanning and if we have to, we'll move into contact.
I got myself, Riegel, and Thomas over here.
Roger, over.
Hey, I'm about to find this bastard, and I'm going to kill him, over.
Okay, roger.
So it's coming from 1705 and 00.
We should be firing on those here right now, break.
Hang it!
Fire! Firing!
The Korengal Outpost is at the 6-3 gridline, and then the 6-2 gridline-- the insurgency has, like, drawn this imaginary line in the sand there, and every time the guys come out of Firebase Phoenix and they cross the 6-2 gridline,
I mean, like, no shit, every time they cross the 6-2 gridline, they get in contact.
So I want to extend the security bubble, because wherever I can place troops and wherever I can provide security is where l'm going to be able to have an influence on the populace.
The hard part is, is that they're so deeply rooted down here because of family ties and because of religious ideals, that getting these people to push out the insurgency and basically push out their family members is going to be the hard part.
Right now the road ends at the Korengal Outpost, and where the road ends is where the Taliban begins.
We've been getting reports that they've been watching us throughout the day, so the contact right now
I'd say is likely or imminent.
- Good to see you.
- Move southeast. It's this way.
Do you want chai?
We don't have time to sit down and have chai tonight.
I just wanted to come in and talk to you briefly about the project.
How many people are you actually going to use to build the project?
What's up?
You see that last house, to the right of it?
Brownish fucking bush about fucking 15, 20 meters to the right?
Yeah?
Someone turned around that corner, saw us and went right back around, dude.
We're going to be moving in darkness.
You're going to be lead, so...
We could move now if you need to.
Okay, spread out.
I'm pushing up here.
Whoa, a tracer came right by here!
Hey!
There's fire coming. They're shooting.
Over there!
Where? Over where?
Tell me, sir, tell me.
Kim!
The first friend I lost was Vimoto, and that was right at the beginning of the deployment. That hit hard.
And then a month after that, I lost Restrepo.
The day that Restrepo got killed, it came across the net that we had troops in contact.
Then they called back in and said that we have a casualty.
I need you to give me fire, Cortez.
We didn't know who it was, because nobody was saying anything over the radio.
When you hear someone's hit, your first reaction is just like, fuck, like, no.
And then you start going through your head all the people that you know out there and wanting to eliminate your friends and the people that were closest to you-- you know, not this guy.
Not this guy. Not this guy.
You know, your heart just sank.
You were like, fuck.
I mean, it was Doc Restrepo.
He was shot in the neck twice... but he was stable, so that was a relief for us.
We say, okay, he's going to be okay, because we looked at him. when he gets on the aircraft, he's still breathing.
But he, it hit his, um, artery in his neck, and he bled out.
He bled out on the helicopter ride to the emergency room where they take you when you get shot.
- This is the big danger area right now.
- Okay.
Because if we're here and they start opening up on us...
You're in between.
But if we clear down, you guys could use my weapons squad as an indicator for where they are, and that's your right limit of fire, man.
Shoot anything up the mountain.
I would say since we haven't been down here and we don't know what's in here,
I'm going to fucking assume the worst, because it's near Kalaygal, and that they have fortified fighting positions throughout here.
Okay.
What were we doing in the Korengal?
Our purpose in the Korengal-- they had a road, and the intent was this road to go through the Korengal and go out to Chowkay Valley to be able to connect the locals where they can have an easy route up towards the Pech River Valley.
And our job there was to try to sustain the security for the personnel, to allow them to build that road.
You know, five, ten years from now, the Korengal Valley is going to have a road going through it that's paved.
And we can make more money, make you guys richer, make you guys more powerful.
What l need though, is l need you to join with the government, you know, provide us with that security or help us provide you guys with that security.
And I'll flood this whole place with money and with projects and with healthcare and with everything.
Remember last week when we said that everything that happened in the past when Captain McKnight was here-- we're kind of, like, wiping the slate clean.
Captain Kearney's got a new slate.
Let's put it behind, and let's get on with what we've got to do now.
Growing up in Oregon, I wasn't allowed to have sugar 'til I was, like, 13, because my mom was a fucking hippie.
And she's always have us doing, like, little hippie children things, I guess-- making, like, homemade paper or painting something or going, like, on nature walks.
It was a nice childhood.
I just wasn't allowed to have toy guns or anything like that, like boys should have, l guess-- little toy guns or, like, violent video games or watch any violent movies at all.
Like l had a toy squirt gun that was a turtle, and my parents took it away because it said "squirt gun"-- it had "gun" on there.
Fire!
Right now priority...
For the first few months of the deployment... we'd get rocked hard. They'd hit us from...
They'd ambush us at 360 degrees.
I remember thinking, you know, holy shit, did everybody from the entire country come to this valley?
Is nobody else fighting anymore? ls every bad guy in my face?
Oh, shit!
Motherfuckers.
In the entire country of Afghanistan, we dropped something close to 70 percent of all the ordinance.
All the bombs that were dropped at that particular time were dropped in the Korengal Valley.
As CNN dubbed it one day when Bush saw it and said, you know, the ugliest place on Earth-- the Korengal Valley.
But to my family,
I never really told them much until about halfway into the deployment.
I didn't tell them when Vimoto died.
I didn't tell them when Sergeant Padilla lost his arm.
I didn't tell them when Pisec got shot.
I didn't tell them when Restrepo got killed.
And then when Restrepo got killed was a few days before my mom's birthday also.
So I had to... I had to suck it up when I called my mom on her birthday and act like everything was okay and say
"Hey, Mom, happy birthday," you know, like, "Yeah, I am doing really good out here, everything's fine."
The change came when we in OP Restrepo.
In the middle of the night we put up a firebase on top of the place that they had used as their enemy kinetic, you know, point of attack, or of origin of their attack, for the last 15 months.
We walked up the Spur with shovels and picks.
We worked all though the night just to make a small semicircle to chill in.
We slept for maybe a couple hours each, started doing it again.
That day we got in five, seven firefights.
Everybody good?
- Yeah, we're gonna--
- Yeah!
We'd dig. They'd shoot at us.
They'd see us digging, building this new place. They'd shoot.
We'd shoot back. Once it lulled down, we started digging again.
When the boys built that base, the Taliban, or the AAF forces in the valley, they were completely in shock.
It was like a middle finger sticking out.
And they realized once they could not knock off OP Restrepo, we had the upper hand.
They started becoming afraid.
Eat some, turban head!
Hey, hit the bottom right.
Hit the bottom right of the village.
- Get this!
- Bottom right. Go right more.
Hey, Solo, that's you.
I'm not shooting over everybody.
- Let's go, let's go!
- He's down in the draw!
- He's down in the draw.
- Down in the draw.
How close?
Buno, get your coms up.
Make sure you got fucking SAW and a.203 with you.
- You're taking Wilson, Cortez.
- Cortez.
Don't worry, I'll...
Don't worry. There's very few that l just straight up hope don't make it.
A month or two into it, it was still a shitty place. We were covered in dirt, digging all the time, getting in firefights, like four or five firefights a day.
And so we-- the majority of us really didn't feel like it should be called OP Restrepo. it was just a shitty place. It was just...
It just didn't resemble the type of person that he was.
Scuffing up my notes.
Feels like longer than forever, yeah
My home is now a distant land
If l had one wish, I wish I could be
Back on that rock in the middle of the sea
My heart is calling me to the islands
Blue skies and tropical breeze
I want to go back home
Swim in the Pacific sea
You can take the boy from the island
But not the island from the boy
The island stays in your heart
I'll never forget where l'm from
Oh, no, I'll never forget
Where l'm from
Sir. How you doing, sir?
Good to see you again.
Good seeing you again.
Welcome to the KOP.
I'd like to take you up over there, sir, maybe just try to give you the once over the world here.
This is the southern Korengal.
This is, uh, l guess you could call it, this is the war zone.
This is where it's all happening.
This is where the majority of the population of the Korengal lives and probably about 90% of the fighting.
If you look just to the south here to that third spur that you see down there, which is called Honcho Hill, that is like the enemy-- I guess you could say-- limit of advance for us.
Like, we can't go any further south than that.
- What do you call it-- Honcho?
- Honcho Hill.
- Honcho Hill.
- You follow that spur, and you go all the way up here,
Sergeant Major,
- and you might be able to see that--
- The tip of the... that top of the OP.
You can see all the bee huts and stuff.
That's OP Restrepo.
Everything south of that is the enemy sanctuary.
Battle 6, Battle 2-5,
I have around 15 up near Restrepo.
Nothing out of the ordinary as far as movement in the southwest today.
Nothing but women and children out tending to the fields and crops.
Enemy assessment-- we've got the AAF are in the final stages to start their attack and moving and getting everything in place.
Last 24, conduct a movement to contact into Loy Kalay, separate the AAF from the populace in order to spread new lO themes.
Hey, Cunningham, on a side note, how's the fam?
How's the what?
- The fam.
- The family?
Billy.
Good. They're pretty good.
Were they happy to see your crazy self?
Yeah, yeah, it was a good time, man.
Got to hang out at the ranch and everything like that, you know?
Got to see pretty much everyone in the family almost.
Your family owns a ranch?
Of course.
Like cows and pigs and chickens and horses ranch?
No.
Like what kind of ranch, then?
It's like a ranch just with like land, you know, with gates and stuff and trucks and whatnot.
Some guns, some wildlife, you know, that you shoot at.
Okay, so it's just a whole bunch of land that they kill stuff on.
Yeah. It's kind of like this.
Yeah, but we're not hunting animals, we're hunting people.
Hearts and minds.
Fucking feed tray.
Yeah. We'll take their hearts, and we'll take their minds.
All right, listen up. Today we're going to conduct a movement to contact.
The purpose is to talk to the locals about some lO themes, as far as the road construction team coming in.
Get some workers from their village to take part in that.
Talk about the cow incident.
- Also...
- It was delicious.
Talk about anything out of the ordinary as far as AAF moving in through their area.
See if they can give us any information on that.
Anyone have any questions?
Guys, it's gonna suck, but I'm going to work you guys into the ground.
I need you guys to go out there and do a patrol in the village because l need you to keep the enemy off his toes. l need you to go out there and push the enemy back so we can buy some white space, so you guys can go back up there and work your asses off filling up these sandbags so that you guys, when do get hit, you get hit but you got something to hide behind.
And the best defense is who has the greater offense.
Elevation 1-5-7-9.
And we are set in Koringal.
What's your father do?
A shepherd? What do you do?
Are you a shepherd, too?
Let me see your hands.
Your hands.
He's got pretty clean hands for being a goat herder.
Where'd you get that watch, man?
You guys got a lot of goats?
60 goats.
60 goats?
That's pretty wealthy, right, Abdul?
Yeah.
Well, what do you know about the people in Kalaygal?
He says...
Roger, we haven't found anybody else to talk to.
We're going to start pushing back now.
Hey, 2-2, this is Bravo 1.
Start pushing out towards the trail.
Oh, fuck.
What have they got?
Oh, I guess a guy running.
- A guy running?
- Yeah.
Hey, Liz!
Lookit. See?
We've seen a guy run from that house once or twice before.
I just don't like the way it is.
I don't like how it feels right now.
You want him watching towards the village or down in the draw?
- Towards the back side of the house.
- Watch the back side of the house.
Hey!
Sit down.
They found a BDU top.
I've got eyes on it right now, over.
Hey, keep on searching this whole house. Search.
Yeah, yeah, like this, good. Okay.
Who does this belong to?
Never mind.
Hey...
"lf I go with you,
I'm not going to go with you right now.
- I will come back to the KOP."
- No, no, he's going-- he's coming with us.
This guy, he was already at the house.
This guy came up later, saw us, and starting taking off running.
I got him, and ever since he started doing what he's doing now.
Hey, tell these guys I'm gonna sit them in my truck, they need to sit on their hands.
Right now what we're tracking came in the valley on April the 11 th.
There's fifteen 107-milimeter rockets, several cases of PKM and AK ammo.
The fear is always there, especially at night when you can't see what's coming at you.
When we started there, we only had maybe fourteen guys up there.
I mean, it doesn't take much.
A few automatic weapons will keep, you know, a squad pinned down, while they could easily come up from a side and flank you and, you know, go basically clear house.
Nobody's going to help you.
You're in no man's land.
The KOP is only seven hundred, eight hundred meters away, but that might as well be in a different country because they're not getting to you.
Not in time.
KOP's taking indirect right now.
KOP's taking indirect.
Can't see shit what they're doing.
Day sight. lt's something.
Better than anything else we got.
I need more fucking 240 here!
One's by Karingal, the other's by Dallas.
Right up there.
The birds we love.
Okay, roger, he's pretty much worked the Honcho Hill ridge.
Want to push him southeast up to 3-0, just southeast of that.
Big firefight, great.
Fucking packing up rounds.
That was fun, though, man, that was fun.
You can't get a better high.
It's like crack, you know?
You can sky dive or bungee jump or do, you know, kayak, but once you've been shot at, you really can't come down.
There's nothing, you can't top that.
How are you going to go back to the civilian world then?
I have no idea.
Hey, did you hear me go cyclic?
- I had the barrel smoked!
- Did you hear me?
Yeah, what the fuck was that first batch about, cuz?
You was crazy as shit with that.
Hey, soon as I popped my head up, holy-- Guess who.
And you just slid down the stairs.
- Common game planning. l was like...
- Get down!
The flight path over...
He's an excellent cook, by far the best cook in the Korengal, definitely.
Came up to Restrepo one time, cooked us fresh cow, same-day cow.
That was a good day.
Jonesie, you want another grill, man?
You all right?
No, l don't like to fuck on a full stomach.
Dude, we're on TV.
Come in here for the real thing.
Don't fight it, don't fight it.
Why don't they mess with you anymore, man?
I was one of the first ones that got messed with to begin with.
Well, look at him, look how sexy he is.
I mean, look at this guy.
He's a beautiful man.
I'd fuck him back in the States.
Let's talk about the road between Omar and Kandalay.
What guy?
Who did we detain?
He says that you detain a guy.
Haji Se, Haji Se.
Naiim was dropped off by another local in Kalaygal who told us that he was bad and that he was working with Sadikula in the-- what the fuck is Sadikula in charge of, Rudy, the Mujahadeen?
Yeah, he's working with the Muj.
And, he was working with the Mujahadeen.
I told you guys from the very get go that if somebody says that they're bad,
I have to investigate it.
So now NDS is talking to him.
He's not in jail.
He's not being treated bad, he's being talked to and asked questions.
I think we've been pretty upfront about how we handle people that we talk to and question.
We've been pretty fair. l'm not like Jim McKnight where l take all these guys and stick them in Bagram and they never come back.
He says were happy you're here, you're doing very well, but he's saying that you detained
Mohammed Youssef before, now Mohammed Youssef didn't come back.
Rudy, who the fuck is Mohammed Youssef?
Mohammed Kalam's son, the guy that cut the worker's heads off.
That's because I saw the video where he cut their heads off.
I saw him do it.
I saw him with my own two eyes.
You're not understanding that I don't fucking care.
And the thing that's sad to me is that as much as Captain Kearney go down there and conduct different Shuras and tell them about the positives about what we can do to help them, it seemed like it didn't go anywhere.
You know?
It seemed like everything that he-
We took one step forward and it seemed like they took two steps backwards.
We've got three village elders just come down and they want to talk.
Not sure what they want to talk about yet.
It's a good sign.
It's the first time it's happened up here at OP Restrepo.
We've had people come in-- elders come in and say before that they wanted to provide some information, but never shown up to us, you know, come back and talk to us.
So this is a positive sign.
Do you hear about the cow that--
- The cow?
- Yeah, the US soldiers kill it.
- They killed--
- Yeah.
So they came because of that.
They want to get information about the cow that--
He is the owner of cow.
All right, the cow?
The reason why we killed it because it ran into our constantine wire and it was mangled inside the constantine wire, so we had to kill it to put it out of its misery because if we would have got it out, it would have been useless.
- That's why we killed it.
- They are asking because it was illegal.
- lllegal?
- Yeah, illegal.
- To kill it?
- Yeah.
- What do you want to do?
- Just tell them.
What do they want us to do about the cow?
Do they want to be reimbursed somehow or--
He says that it is up to you, if you want to pay money for that or--
How much does a cow cost?
It's going to be like four or five hundred dollars, which is going to be twenty, twenty five thousand Afghani, over.
Did we kill this cow?
Well, it was tangled up in a wire, pretty much dead.
324 ended up cutting it up. Over.
We're not going to be able to give him money in exchange for his cow.
But what we can give him is the rice, the beans, the sugar.
Now, the HA that they will receive is going to be, you know, the weight of the cow.
Whatever the weight of the cow was will be the weight of return of HA as far as rice, beans, sugar.
- ls that good?
- They want money.
We're not going to be able to give them the money.
If that's all he came for, he's not going to get it.
626 perstat, I have 20 at Restrepo,
15 at the KOP, 4 at OP1,
4 on leave,
6 ANA and one terp at Restrepo, break.
Talk louder, nobody can hear you down here, over.
626 perstat,
I have 20 at Restrepo,
15 at the KOP,
4 at OP1,
4 on leave,
1 photo journalist,
6 ANA, and 1 terp--
I didn't know they had algebra two.
Yeah! Burning the poop!
Got the black man on the burning the poop detail.
Hey, man, just watch yourself, God damn it.
Second platoon killed that cow and now I gotta pay for it.
I still wanna see Spanky and Vaughn go at it.
- Vaughn would fucking destroy Spanky.
- Let's go get him.
Vaughn!
Vaughn, you're going to beat Spanky's ass!
He's coming up here, you better not lose.
Dude, if you lose, so help me God.
It's going to reflect poorly on me if you lose.
You better not let that cherry bitch beat you.
Make him tough.
Get him, get him.
- Vaughn.
- What's up, dude?
- Come on, fight back!
- You're such a little bitch.
All right, go ahead.
- Stretch them out.
- What the fuck, Spanky?
You gonna let him fucking manhandle you?
- Let him get tired.
- Flip over, man.
Yeah, there you go!
Nice, there you go.
You suck!
Battle of the cherries.
We're not talking about cherry in the army either, we're talking about cherry at life.
Vaughn here is very cherry at life.
But we're making him into a man.
That's all that's important here.
...we talked about the road being built.
Continued to hear from the elders that they don't want to give up any workers, despite what it is that you all have been telling me.
So if you guys get these local-- that are willing to do that to come and start getting them jobs immediately, to bypass all the elder-- l don't think--
I think they're just--
If we really fucked them up like they said, then they are just chilling, trying to recuperate.
It's just like what we would be doing.
You know, seven-- eight dudes wounded,
I mean seven dudes wounded, one dude dead, we wouldn't be going out strong.
We'd be resting at Blessing right now.
You know what I mean?
That's what I think they're doing-- resting.
Are you wondering why it is so quiet?
Yeah, it's got me baffled right now.
Baffled or worried?
Just confused.
I am at a loss for words right now.
He's worried.
He's worried. He's scared.
Most scared.
Or worried. Whatever.
Yeah.
I'd have to say Rock Avalanche.
If l had to pick a moment,
I'd probably say Rock Avalanche.
Operation Rock Avalanche was the low point for me personally.
I saw a lot of professional tough guys get weak in the knees.
I'll go ahead and orient you guys to the different LZs that are out there.
Up on Divpat where the C2 element will be located is LZ Cubs.
The Taliban or the AAF forces in the valley, they got very, very audacious and tenacious during Rock Avalanche.
Physically putting their hands on soldiers, able to get so close to us that they can kill my soldiers, steal the equipment, and still get away.
I mean... that's ballsy.
We'll be releasing with Wildcat One, somewhere between Busch and Coors.
Moving in on Rock Avalanche with going into areas like Yaka China or up on the top of the Talisar.
Those are areas we haven't previously been, you know, during the deployment.
North goes that way toward Sergeant Rougle, south is this way towards me and the First Sergeant.
To go in there not ever having laid eyes on the area, hearing the stories about guys who'd gone prior to us getting fucked up down, you know, in areas where they literally shouldn't have been in.
We're going to be moving out of HLZ Cubs into HLZ Polk. ln Rock Avalanche we knew the expectation that we was going to get engaged going up there, but we all knew that.
In the location where we was actually going to conducting this operation and stuff, was where the bad guys, their safe haven was at.
: They wasn't coming to you.
Sometimes you had to go out there and reach out to them.
Go into program, go into your radio configurations, and then where it says
SINCGARS or basic, change that to ANDVT.
- Coming after you, motherfucker.
- Right here, bitch?
Let's do this, motherfucker! l'm coming back.
I'm coming back, don't worry.
Do you get nervous before something like this?
I get nervous for the guys.
I get nervous for myself.
I mean, I just--
I just called my mom and dad and I'll try calling my wife before I take off, just one last "I love you" to all of them.
And, you know, the guys, that's the hardest thing is like, you know, if something happens to me, there's not much I can do about it or anything like that.
But it takes a little bit out of you every time you see one of your boys get hurt or you lose one of them.
It's really like a big family.
We flew in the middle of the night.
Guess what, they're not quiet helicopters that we fly.
The enemy's awake now.
What the fuck are the Americans doing flying over us right now?
So now everybody's on their radio's, l'm sure, you know, "Hey, the Americans are heading this way."
So we got on the ground and we were already being told, be on alert, you know, everybody knows we're here.
If we could get one going from west to east into that draw, over.
It's real hot.
- All right, break.
- Coming out.
I'd like you to come in for one more re-attack.
Come down in elevation in that draw and fill right there in the center, over.
So you did hit the target.
This house right there.
This is the aftermath of what AH-64s do.
Good old attack helicopters.
He said that there is five guys already dead and ten of the females and kids already, they are injured, you know.
Show me which of them is the Taliban.
There is no Taliban.
Damn it.
You know?
I need to know better.
I need to figure this stuff out better so that l can do this, so that l'm not killing these people and not making them mad.
I mean, first impressions are the lasting impression.
That's the first time anybody's been in Yaka China, and what do l do?
I kill a bunch of bad guys, but in the same instance,
I'm killing five locals that may not have been the ones that pulled the trigger, but in some way shape or form, were connected to them.
There you go.
Dishka?
Afghan dishka, not American dishka, right?
This is divorce paper.
- What?
- Divorce paper.
- Di-wars?
- Paper, yeah.
- What does that mean?
- Divorce.
Like some woman you getting married then you're going to get a divorce.
- Divorce papers?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Who owns the house?
Did you ask him where the pistol was?
Eight RPG heads.
One, two, three, four boosters.
Got four boosters, three batteries, shotgun.
This is Colonel Ostlund, he's my boss, you know, the one I always tell you.
We brought the Colonel down there to talk to them, and we did that because basically we felt bad for the fact that we injured some of their kids and that we killed some of the locals.
The ACM that comes in and gives you five dollars to carry this stuff around the mountains and tells you that you're doing a jihad and go fight the Americans is doing nothing for you except making you a slave for five dollars as he hides on a mountain, because he won't fight my soldiers.
These foreigners, they don't fight my soldiers.
They hide on a mountain in a cave, under a rock and talk on a radio and pay your sons a small amount of money to go ahead and shoot at my soldiers and my soldiers end up killing your sons.
But this is the deal we'll make.
Everybody needs a job, and we're going to try to bring progress here and some jobs, and Captain Kearney will talk to the Shura on Friday about some job projects.
The whole time we were there, we were thinking, "Okay.
When's it coming?
When's it coming.
They're going to hit us.
When's it going to happen?
- This sucks, dude.
- I'm just going to double check it.
ICOM chatter right now coming out of Chappadara, a guy named Obed's talking to the elders, and apparently said that the elders are in charge of what's going on.
The elders basically want jihad down here in the Korengal, and whatever they want, they'll-- they're here to assist, so we'll see what happens.
But it doesn't sound very good for us, huh?
Hey, Sergeant Patterson,
I found four fighting positions over there, AK-47s.
I'm going to push to this next hilltop.
I'm also getting ICOM traffic that there may be enemy close to us.
Getting intel saying that they've got eyes on three to four US personnel and they're getting close to them.
So they've got eyes on us and it can be anywhere, this high ground there, there's some more spurs back there, there's one we crossed to an open patch back there.
They could have easily had eyes on us when we were moving in.
What the fuck was that?
Did you hear that?
It might be the birds, sir.
Shooting?
Am l just jumpy?
Fucking Christ, monitor this.
Sergeant P... do we got guys in these pine trees right here?
Do we?
When the attack finally happened,
I remember it was myself and my team on the south eastern corner of basically the area that we were covering.
We got ambushed, like, just every single position got hit at the same time pretty much.
They placed a PKM a machine gun down into our position and one orientated into the scout position, and just rained down hell.
I just look over to my right and I see rounds breaking branches off the tree.
They were shooting RPGs at us, they were shooting pretty much everything.
When l got hit, it actually came with enough force that it rolled me forward.
You know, initial thought was,
"What happened?"
I felt pain, you know, placed my hand there just underneath my IBA because that's where I felt, you know, the initial pain, pulled my hand out, saw blood, knew l was hit.
I looked up in time from all fours to watch a guy come over the crest probably about 35-45 meters to fire an RPG directly at me. lnitial thought was, "Wow, this is the last thing l'm going to see," because the guy was so close.
And, you know, the round came in, exploded.
Took shrapneI all throughout my body, but... kind of did-- after the explosion, like,
"I'm still here, I'm still alive," and then proceeded to basically roll down the mountain into the bushes.
And they were all up in position,
I could hear them talking to each other.
To our north we heard somebody yelling for a medic.
I was the first one that heard it.
I yelled back to Sergeant Hoyt, telling him if I could go and see who who it was.
Myself along with Cortez started moving-- we started bounding towards where we heard the guy yelling from.
We didn't know who it was.
I got to the wounded and found out it was Vandenberge.
I yelled back it was Vandenberge that was wounded, bring a medic.
He was just bleeding real bad.
His whole left side of his body was this real dark red color.
And all he kept on saying was,
"Hey, help me, guys. Help me." just rocking back and forth.
Saying "I'm bleeding out, you gotta save me. l'm dying."
Just stuff like that.
Started handing him gauze, tourniquet.
Just started packing the wound with gauze. l had my finger knuckle-deep in his arm.
Ended up stopping the bleeding.
I'm asking,
"Where are the guys at?
Where's the Taliban at?
Where's the enemy at?"
Last time he saw them, they were 20 feet away.
And just was I was going to give him an lV,
Sergeant Stichter and Doc Old got there and carried on from there.
Sergeant Patterson and all them took over, and I pushed out with Cortez.
We didn't bound, we didn't do anything, we just ran in a straight line and got to Rice as quick as we can.
At that point I kind of realized,
"Hey, l'm stable.
"You know, I been here ten, fifteen minutes.
I'm still breathing,
I'm not going into shock."
Kind of evaluating myself.
So basically just gave them orders to--
"Hey, you need to maneuver your guys.
And push up and clear across that hilltop."
As l went up,
I didn't see anyone there.
I took a knee and set up security, and when I turned to my right,
I saw Sergeant Rougle just laying there.
I ran up and I saw
Sergeant Rougle's body and it didn't even click.
I ran past him.
I saw his face, how it was, kind of messed up.
I wanted to cry, but didn't.
I was shocked, honestly.
I was shocked because I saw
Sergeant Rougle just laying there.
It was-- It was chaos.
And when we finally had a second to stop and think, that's when l realized that one of my good friends had gone, you know, and I started hearing about
Sergeant Rice, Vandenberge.
I didn't even know that they had been hit at that point.
And...
I need a--
Yeah, time out. Hold on.
I'm just trying to keep my train of thought.
Have that box ready.
Have the next goddamn box ready.
Hey, I need immediate suppression on 2251.
They enemy's pushed up on the high ground--
We're not getting shit.
512255, if we've got A-10s,
I want gun runs from east to west coming in, okay?
The hill's been taken over by the enemy.
That hill right here?
WiIdcat's hill.
All right, we're going to go around to the east and go around.
Hey, Abdul!
Get the fuck over here! tell these guys we're pushing up on this fucking ridge.
Hey, he wants us to go up over this hill and bum rush it.
There's fucking dudes right there.
If we do that, we're going to have to fucking lay down some--
We're going to have to lay down fire first.
- Yeah, but we--
- We can't get a hold of them.
We don't know where they're at.
That's why we have to lay down fire first.
Look, they took fire from right over here.
Okay?
Hey, who's down?
We got Sergeant Rougle and them up?
Hey.
What?
Where they at?
Just keep down.
- Get down.
- What?
- What's going on?
- Just chill out, dude.
- Chill the fuck out out.
- Who's over there?
Oh, my God.
Shut up.
Move, man.
Is Sergeant Rice still alive?
- He's alive?
- He's going to make it.
- There's nothing we could do.
- Where's everybody else?
Hey, we've got friendlies here and friendlies to your six, right there.
Vandenberge all right?
Vandenberge's already--
He's stable right now.
That ain't Sergeant Rougle.
You're lying, right, man?
Why would I lie about something like that?
Where'd he get hit?
I got to see.
Don't look at him. ls it bad?
Tell me, dude.
Tell me, dude.
It was quick.
It was quick.
There was nothing we could do, bro!
Where the bad guys at?
Battle Six Romeo, this is two-six.
I've pushed to the site of the KIA, break.
Right now we have the hilltop.
It's in the same vicinity as my last grid.
Right now we're going to move the wounded in action-- there's two of them-- back to LZ Eagles.
When Captain Kearney told me up by the LZ that Staff Sergeant Rougle was killed, it was gut wrenching.
You know, there's different levels to quality of fighters.
He was one of the best, if not the best.
And l think that was what was tough for a lot of people was, you know, kind of knowing that in the back of their mind, well, if the best guy we have out here just got killed, where's that put me?
What's going to happen to me?
What's going to happen to the guy to my left, to my right?
Hey, we're going down here to get the wounded first.
- Hey, let's go.
- Let's go.
It was a coordinated attack.
They drew all our attention over to there from here.
These guys over here also returning fire from there.
They fucking flanked them.
You can see where the path is here where the fuckers came up.
Okay, where's this fucking compound?
I want it destroyed.
Let's go.
- Stichter, destroy it now.
- Yes, sir.
After we go ahead and get the KlA out of here,
I want gunmetal to search directly to my west.
Hijar believes that he has a blood trail,
I want them to be getting down low to try and PlD and see where this guy's stopped.
It's likely that where we find this son of a bitch is where we find everybody else.
Hijar, make sure he understood that.
Watch the pine trees.
Just on the north side of that, you can see a house on the corner.
As it cuts like that?
It comes almost like an L shape.
- See the terraces right there?
- Got it.
Okay, now, the fucking far southeast side, there's a fucking-- there's a dude on the roof down in that house.
- About a thousand meters.
- Roger.
Hey, Raeon's got a guy to our northwest on top of a building walking around, over.
- Any other info?
- No.
He was looking up this way, and he just came off the roof, and he went back in his house.
Roger, acknowledge.
Raeon, next time you see that dude, take his head off.
Where's that range finder at?
He was a good dude, man.
Sergeant Rougle?
- You want a real cigarette?
- Yeah.
I'm worried about the rest of the guys.
They've been taking it real bad.
One Alpha's kind of blaming it on himself because we couldn't push over the top, but the thing he's got to understand is they fucking--
He was dead instantly.
There's nothing you can do right there.
Actually, l can't even sleep, honestly.
I've been on about four or five different types of sleeping pills and none of them help.
That's how bad the nightmares are.
I prefer not to sleep and not dream about it, than sleep and... just see the picture in my head is... pretty bad.
That actually stuck with me for the rest of the deployment.
Stuck with me through coming back here to Italy.
I still obviously haven't... figured out how to deal with it inside.
The only hope
I have right now is that eventually l'll be able to process it differently.
I'm never going to forget it.
Never going to even let go of it. l don't want to not have that as a memory because that was tone of the moments that makes me appreciate everything that I have.
Steiner?
Steiner, come on!
Not yet. Not yet.
Still working to try to bring about the Korengal to get the road moving here.
Are you really drawing the Korengal Valley? lt's the only thing
I know how to draw.
I just send it home in letters.
Just draw.
So do you have a songbook or something, or an exercise book to practice with?
You just fuck around?
Yeah I'm just fucking around.
You need one of those books, with the charts on them.
Yeah, I need-- that would be nice.
Restrepo was teaching me that stuff, but he-- he taught me like a few, but l wrote just one, a C chord, but, you know, I don't know.
I still have his--
I actually still have one of his Flamenco books or whatever it is.
How to play guitar flamenco, you know.
He was amazing on guitar.
- It was just beautiful music.
- It was amazing.
He used to grow his fingernails out real long, and put like nail hardener.
So we always used to get on him about that.
Yeah, but-- with his teeth--
"yeah, but can--
"can you play the guitar like me, yo, son?
Shun?"
Twenty seven May, movement to contact west of Restrepo.
Task disrupt, purpose prevent AAF from building mass fires on Restrepo.
That concludes my report. Over.
- How long till he gets tired?
- Hump him, Walker.
Ow, my hip.
Is he squeezing you with his fucking mammoth legs?
- Heart punch, heart punch.
- There you go, film Walker.
Walker!
I think they just changed, didn't they?
I just want to see.
- Walker.
- I'm bored.
Say something to your wife.
Dude, you know you want to.
Hey, babe, I miss you.
Can't wait to get home and--
Hurry up, hurry up!
Do you want to know when you're going home or not?
All right, what's been told to the wives is we'll be back in Italy, not out of country, back in Italy between
August 4th and 7th.
So look at your fucking watch.
Two months from today and counting down.
That's bad news if you're one of those dudes that's like,
"Fuck, I love it here and I wanted to wait till September and get an extra thousand dollars."
And if that's you, I don't care.
Fuck you.
We're going home.
Today things were a little bit hectic.
We found out that one of our sister companies, Chosen Company, up north of Camp Blessing, starting a new base lost nine soldiers and had an additional twelve US wounded and an thirteen additional ANA that were wounded.
Hey, is this everybody?
We got the Mortars?
We got Second Platoon?
Okay, hey, listen up.
I'm going to talk to you guys a little bit about some of what happened up with Chosen Company.
I want you guys to mourn, and then l want you guys to get over it and do your jobs.
Okay?
First-- Hey, Proctor, why did you come in the army, man?
To fight for my country, sir.
- To fight for your country?
- Roger, sir.
Did you expect that you might get injured or die?
Absolutely, sir.
Anybody join not knowing that that might be an option?
We lose PFC Vimoto on June 5th, 2007.
What happens the very next day after that, Sergeant Buno?
We go out on patrols, we get attacked again.
Right.
July 22nd, we lose Restrepo, right?
What do we keep on doing after that?
Fighting.
We keep on fighting and taking it to the enemy, right?
What do you guys think would have happened if we had just stopped at Vimoto and acted like our predecessors before us and we stood our ground there, didn't go out there doing our aggressive patrolling, didn't go out there and build OP Restrepo, which I think we'll all venture to say, like, pretty much changed the entire dynamics of the entire valley?
You guys know what would have happened?
The same shit that happened today up at Chosen Company.
Now with Chosen Company, they went into an area that they knew was going to be contested.
They knew what they were getting into.
They've been talking about going to Wanat since July of 2007.
We went there, they did it.
The fucking only way to bounce back from shit like this is to go out there and make the individuals that did this to us fucking pay.
It's not to sit back here and hide.
It's not to go back down to our fucking rucks and fucking feel sorry for ourselves and get snuggled up in our woobie.
We go out there, we find the motherfuckers that did this and we make them pay.
We make them feeI how we feel right now.
For those of you guys that pray, let's go ahead and take a moment of silence in-- in remembrance the ten-- ten to nine soldiers that we lost today and the families of them and the families of those that were hurt, and then I'll let you guys go ahead and get about your business.
Get down.
Oh, wow, you can't see shit now.
Hey, can I shoot Sergeant Mac?
I'm I'm going to fucking get him.
- Can I shoot?
- Wait till he engages.
Wait till he engages, then fucking fucking get him.
There he goes.
Low right, low right!
Low right!
- Hey, that motherfucker's done.
- Is he?
Hey, Olson, he's done.
Yeah!
A direct hit on that dude.
That motherfucker's done, man!
That motherfucker's done, dude!
Fuck you, bitches!
Body parts falling apart.
The L-Ras, dude, it was him running and then him blasting into pieces.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, dude.
There you go, motherfucker, shoot at us again.
By the end, like I was--
I really didn't want to get overrun.
But l just wish they were closer so l could have actually seen them when I killed them.
626 perstat,
I have twenty Restrepo.
The only question I have is tonight, are we going to be doing an illum round for Doc Restrepo?
Today's twenty two July.
Over.
Yeah, we're planning on doing the illum round.
One last thing, seventeen tonight they're shooting for Doc Restrepo.
Seventeen tonight.
He's fucking a little bit drunk.
I'm fucking--
I'm a little bit drunk at this point.
And I see him--
I see him just eyeing everyone up, just like this.
Who is that, Kim?
No, Restrepo.
Eyeing everyone up.
I come up to him and I'm like, "What's wrong, bro?"
He's like, "Yo, bro,
I'm going to stab these fools, yo."
I'm like, I see it in his hand.
He's got the fucking Gerber out with the knife out, fucking closed up, just ready to fucking shank someone, dude.
I'm like-- and this is after the night before we ended up down in the fucking the steps of Rome fucking train station, and I was peeing, in my pants.
What we did to mark the anniversary of our dead, we shot off flares, and where Restrepo died, we shot off flares.
You know, and kind of raise one up.
Say a prayer, say a few words in your head and you move on.
Did my last patrol hopefully.
Hopefully I don't get called back out for something.
Fly out of here in a few days.
It's kind of strange thinking you'll never come back to OP Restrepo again.
Yeah.
It's a good feeling, though.
It's been a long fucking deployment right there.
Leaving Restrepo?
It's too good to be true, you know?
We're going to die here. lsn't that right, Henry?
- Roger, Sergeant.
- But we're leaving instead.
God's going to fuck with our emotions and kill us on the bird out.
I'm never coming back, never coming back.
It's time to go.
That's heavy.
Goodbye, OP Restrepo.
I'm never going to have to be here again.
Not that I didn't enjoy my time here, but it's time to move on.
- Yes!
- See you later.
The high point for us was going home.
Getting out of there.
Going home, seriously.
No doubt about it.
Each one of my soldiers' face, you can tell, going home.
We done our job.
We did what we were supposed to have been doing and we out of here.
The Korengal, as far as--
What did we we achieve?
I'm always going to think about Restrepo.
BuiIding Restrepo was the single most important event for the Korengal.
And how... how the boys did it.
Fighting.
And then turning around and going back to working.
It makes us proud when we see the news-- they still call it Restrepo-- knowing that, you know, we painted it on the walls, this is for Doc Restrepo.
The name fit the place after a while, after it became built up, after it became a better place.
But when l hear Restrepo,
I still think of the person.
You can't-- You can't tame the beast.
You know?
Got him.
Yeah, he got him. He got him.
He did get him.
Hey, Lex, what's going on tonight?
Just tell us.
Break it down, break it down.
All I want to do is find a miniature zebra, put a little tiny saddle on it and ride it.
There ain't no zebras on the pub crawl.
I didn't-- Miniature zebras.
My bad, there are miniature zebras.
What the fuck?
Let's say goodbye, let's say goodbye.
Hey, tune in next time where we're going to be still drunk as fuck.
Saying goodnight to the bad guy, man.
The same time, the same dope rhyme, because we're going to be still loving life and getting ready to go to war.
Here or hea?
H-E-A. Hea.
"O'Byrne wuz hea."
That's how we roll.
She is perhaps Hitler's best-known victim.
Her book has sold more than 25 million copies...
...and has been translated into at least 55 languages.
She's become a symbol of 10 million souls murdered by the Nazis...
...Jews and non-Jews...
...and, in particular, the one and a half million innocent children.
She was just 15 when she died.
A miserable and lonely death in a concentration camp in Germany.
Yet she is remembered for her faith in humanity.
This is the story of the life and legacy of Anne Frank.
In Amsterdam, some of the remnants of a once-thriving Jewish community.
Every person in this congregation, like Jews throughout Europe...
...has a story of their own...
...of persecution, murder, fear or betrayal.
The rabbi spent the first
2 years of his life in hiding...
...sheltered by a Christian family.
But one girl reaches beyond all those memories.
Hers is not just a Holocaust story, for the voice of Anne Frank...
...stands as a warning to those who discriminate on the basis...
...of color, culture or creed.
Her message is as fresh today as it was 50 years ago.
The notorious Nazi propaganda film...
...The Eternal Jew.
Distorted images portraying an Aryan nightmare...
...of the Jewish threat to European civilization.
And this, the family Frank:
Prosperous, cultivated, sophisticated...
...and integrated.
In fact, they were a German family.
German to the core.
The antithesis of ghetto Jews.
Anne's father, Otto, was an officer in the German army...
...in the first World War.
The family had lived in and around
Frankfurt for generations.
But Otto had traveled the world, even working in Macy's store in New York...
...where a college friend,
Nathan Straus, was the owner's son.
In 1925, the 36-year-old Otto married Edith Hollander...
...a 25-year-old Jewish girl from Aachen, Germany...
...near the Dutch border.
They honeymooned in Italy.
Their first daughter, Margot, followed 9 months later...
...and their second, Annelies, better known as Anne, in June 1929.
It was a good life in Frankfurt in those early years.
One could almost forget the long shadow of National Socialism.
But beneath the idyllic surface...
...far removed from the children's world, turmoil.
DANGER JEWS
Their landlord turned out to be a Nazi party member.
And in March 1931, they moved.
The bank owned by the family also had serious problems...
...resulting in its complete collapse in 1933...
...caused by Otto's brother being the victim of a fraud...
...and the effects of the Depression, particularly acute in Germany.
And, of course, the threat of the gathering storm.
On the streets...
...at the rallies...
ONE RACE ONE NATION
...and finally in January 1933...
...the ballot box.
ONE LEADER
For it is often forgotten that Hitler gained power in a democratic election.
For the Franks, the German dream was over.
Some of the family had moved to Switzerland.
Otto chose to try his luck in Holland...
...where he had prior business connections.
In autumn 1933, the family settled here in Merwedeplein...
...a modern housing development in South Amsterdam.
They established a settled and full existence amongst German refugees...
...and Dutch neighbors.
We moved into the same neighborhood as the Frank family.
Many other refugees moved there.
And so there was a little bit of a German-Jewish enclave...
...by no means a ghetto, but just a little enclave.
Quite often parents would speak
German in the street...
...which annoyed us children terribly, of course.
Hanneli Goslar
My father was a deputy minister in the interior.
And he was the chief of the press in Germany.
He had really a very high position.
And he immediately fled...
...when the whole government stepped down.
And, okay, we went to England before...
...but he didn't find a job where he didn't have to work Shabbat.
And so we stopped here in Merwedeplein.
Life for Jewish refugees...
...as I experienced it as a young child, in a way had its charms.
What I particularly enjoyed was that we adapted faster than our parents.
Our parents had to turn to us and ask us...
...what's done in this country.
And I found this tremendously democratizing.
I really enjoyed that part very much.
The Franks formed an active social life amongst the other refugee families.
For visitors, Anne's behavior made the Sunday gatherings...
...something of an ordeal.
She was just what you could call naughty.
She had to sit on a table where everything was very beautiful...
...in a beautiful dress and have her chocolate not spoil it.
Isa Baschwitz
She just didn't want to.
She got up and she made fuss, and she...
...drew attention.
And then she grew angry.
And that angriness...
...that was the problem between the parents.
Mother Frank said, "You sit down. "
And Father Frank said:
"Leave the child alone.
She's so small and she's so little. "
So she was allowed to do the things she wanted.
And that happened every time.
Every time that girl was naughty...
...was impertinent, later on, really impertinent.
I remember very strongly that Mr. Frank...
...was seen as an ideal daddy, that he was the daddy...
...because he was so much involved in his girls' education.
He fixed his wife breakfast on Sunday morning and brought it to her bedside...
...which was unheard of in our circles.
So that news made the round:
"Mr. Frank does this for his wife!
How great. "
Otto Frank interviewed in 1979
We left Germany in 1933...
...because I didn't want to educate my children with blinkers.
They were not allowed to see
Christian friends anymore.
In Holland, it was different.
Upon her arrival in Amsterdam...
...the 4-year-old Anne was sent to the Montessori school...
...where Lies Goslar became her best friend.
Years later, in her diary,
Anne wrote this of Lies:
"Hanneli Goslar, or Lies, as she's called at school, is a bit strange.
She's usually shy...
...outspoken at home but reserved around other people.
She blabs whatever you tell her to her mother.
But she says what she thinks.
And lately, I've come to appreciate her a great deal. "
Anne and Lies' friendship had begun on their very first day at school.
Exactly in opposite of the door...
...I saw the back of Anne, and she was ringing these little bells.
And she turned around, and she saw me,
I saw her, and hop...
...we run each into the arms of another.
I think my mother went away.
I didn't look at her anymore.
And this was the first day.
Since then we were together really till the end.
Of the two sisters, I was really more impressed with Margot than with Anne...
...for rather obvious reasons.
Margot was a year and a half older than I am, so she was a model.
She was ladylike.
She was always composed.
She always did her homework.
She was just the ideal young lady.
I was a tomboy, so I always thought it would be great to be like Margot.
Anne was very lively, and I didn't need any model for that.
I was lively myself.
Besides, she was younger. You never model yourself after a younger child.
So I know her-
All the time.
I could do that just as well.
I will start with the sentence my mother said always.
My mother said, "God knows everything.
Anne knows everything better. "
This describes Anne, you understand?
I don't know in English...
She knew everything better.
Anne was- In America you say "spicy. "
A spicy girl.
She always was friendly with the boys.
The boys liked her.
The girls liked her. She also always was in the center of the thing.
Then she had something I never saw, not before and not afterwards.
She could take out the socket out of the shoulder...
...and she would sit, and everybody looked.
And then she made out, and knock, knock, knock.
You have to be very careful. You can end up with an orthopedic doctor.
She liked it, and everybody was looking at her. And then she was happy.
When he came to Holland, Otto Frank set up the Opekta Company...
...a Dutch subsidiary of a German concern, selling pectin...
...a substance used in making jam.
The progressive Otto had a film produced to promote the product.
In the early days, he had four key colleagues, all non-Jews.
One of those employees was an Austrian who'd grown up in Holland.
Miep Gies.
It was a very fine place to work...
...because we understand all the people in the office.
We were very close, was friendly together.
He was always our boss...
...but also our father.
We can go to Mr. Frank with all our troubles and sorrow.
The office boy and general helper from 1933 until 1939...
...was Henk van Beersekamp.
Mrs. Frank was different from Otto Frank.
Otto Frank was a familiar, friendly man...
...who treated me as an equal...
...and with kindness.
Mrs. Frank was a bit...
...well, maybe she had been accustomed...
...to better things in life in Germany.
I don't know.
Margot was a bit subdued...
...but Anne was a dear.
I had lots of fun with her...
...because we would make funny faces...
...which she found amusing.
I remember one time I did this:
And she always split her sides with laughter.
And when I did that, her tongue...
...would move to and fro.
But it was fun.
She was a great girl.
Dutch Nazis putting on a show in Amsterdam in 1938.
Though Hitler had infiltrated the police, the civil service...
...even the prime minister...
...in the years before the war, Holland...
...was generally good to its Jewish refugees from Germany.
Despite these scenes of Fascist collaborators...
...the Dutch and German Jews believed that they would be safe in Holland...
...far from the Führer in their former homeland.
Few, very few, tried to leave for safer shores.
And Otto and his family were not amongst them.
Sometimes I said to Mr. Frank:
"You must go out of the Netherlands.
It will be danger for you. "
Miep Gies
"No," said he.
"In the first World War, the German came not here in the Netherlands.
So they come the second time, also not. "
And I said to him,
"You must go to America. "
"No, I stay here because I love the Netherlands. "
The faith of Otto Frank and thousands like him...
...was catastrophically misplaced.
By May 1940, Hitler had conquered almost all of Europe.
Austria, Poland, Norway, Denmark...
...Yugoslavia, Greece,
Romania, Bulgaria...
...and most of France had fallen to
Germany's air force and storm troops.
Europe's low countries remained as a tantalizing morsel...
...to be swallowed whole.
Then by the 14th of May, 1940, it was all over.
Five days after the Germans had finally...
...smashed through Holland's borders, the Dutch capitulated.
In Amsterdam, Hitler's victory was greeted with black humor.
My father made himself look like Hitler.
It was wonderful how he did it.
Here was the hair and the black mustache.
The Franks lived next door, and he would ring at the door and come in.
I remember them all, you know, the first moment.
They were very frightened what happened.
If you could think Hitler didn't come to their house.
But it was very funny how everybody was frightened at the moment...
...till they...
...till they saw who it was and what happened.
What happened to your father?
He died in Bergen-Belsen.
The German vice tightened gradually.
First they conducted a hearts-and-minds campaign to win over the Dutch...
...their Aryan brothers.
THANK ADOLF HITLER
JEWISH QUARTER
For the Jews, it was another story...
...as their freedom was gradually restricted...
...by a never-ending series of anti-Jewish decrees...
...already familiar in Germany and other conquered territories.
JEWS PROHIBlTED
By 1942...
...no area of Jewish life was excluded from German control.
Jews Prohibited
By Law
Everything that was fun in life was forbidden.
We were not allowed to go anymore to a park or to a swimming pool.
We were not allowed to go to shops.
Only to Jewish shops and only between 3 and 5.
8:00 in the evening you had to be at home.
You had to wear the star.
You had to have something with you that would look if you are Jewish or not...
...even if you had the star.
Then things were-
You were frightened.
You just wouldn't go out.
To school and home, and that's it, yes.
How one of the friends of Anne said:
"Everything I did, I was afraid it is forbidden. "
Well, the effect of these restrictions...
...was, I think, mainly...
...because it came inch by inch, very slowly.
"If that's all, we can bear it. "
We always had a stiff upper lip, and we tried to make the best of it.
If you can't go to public school anymore...
...there are good Jewish teachers.
If you can't go to concerts, which was important in my family...
...there are fine Jewish musicians, so we make music at home.
So we always tried to put the best spin...
...on whatever happened.
And that way, I think, we tried to ward off...
...thinking about how we were being more restricted...
...and what was going to be sure to come afterwards.
Otto Frank, always the perfect father...
...rented movies to show the girls on the living room wall.
Rin Tin Tin was a particular favorite with Anne.
She and her friend Jacqueline van
Maarsen created a cinema of their own.
Together we made little cards to get in.
Of course, everybody could come in, but we wanted to make it look real...
...by making these little tickets.
"Jacqueline van Maarsen...
...is invited on Sunday, the 1st of March...
...with Anne Frank, Merwedeplein 37...
...for...
...a movie.
Without this card, no entrance.
Please inform in time. Row 2.
Seat 2."
THE LIGHTHOUSE BY THE SEA
WITH RIN TIN TIN
This film supplied the entertainment for Anne and her friends...
...when they celebrated her 13th birthday...
...her last in freedom.
Her prized gift that 13th birthday...
...on Friday, the 12th of June, 1942...
...was her diary...
...a present she had bought with her father a few days before.
From the beginning, Anne addressed her diary as a special friend...
...with whom she would conduct a secret correspondence.
Her first entry was this:
"I hope I will be able to confide everything to you...
...as I have never been able to confide in anyone.
And I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support. "
Her early diary jottings were typical of a 13-year-old:
Gossip about school friends, jokes...
...and a record of her unextraordinary daily life...
...together with photos and other scraps.
In the years that followed, she also shared her most intimate secrets...
...including her increasing interest in the development of her body and in sex.
What interested Anne very much was sexual behavior...
...and she wanted to know what it was all about.
Jacqueline "Jopie" van Maarsen
And she asked her father about it.
I knew much more than she did...
...because I had my sister, who told me everything.
So I thought, "Well, I'm not going to enlighten you altogether.
You just ask your father. "
At the time, Anne's body was not changing yet.
And I think that she was curious...
...because she had some little...
She used a bra from Margot with cotton wool in it...
...to show a bit of breast.
And I did not need that kind of thing...
...and she was interested to see exactly...
While Anne was innocently absorbed with her developing body...
...Otto Frank was mindful that if the Nazi measures against Jews...
...continued to their inevitable conclusion...
...he and his family would need to take precautions to protect themselves.
For a year, he had been secretly preparing a hiding place for them all...
...together with his German business associate Hermann van Pels...
...van Pels' wife, Auguste, and son, Peter.
It was to be in several rooms behind the company offices on Prinsengracht...
...in central Amsterdam.
Laboriously, and unknown to all but the innermost circle...
...Otto accumulated furniture, cooking implements...
...bedding and clothes.
At the Frank home, two and a half miles away in Merwedeplein...
...Sunday, the 5th of July, 1942, was the day that everyone had dreaded...
...had hoped against hope would never come.
That Sunday, the Germans delivered...
...this innocuous document by registered mail...
...to several thousand Jews, the majority of them of German extraction...
...aged between 15 and 40.
They were to report within 9 days to be transported to a labor camp...
...in Germany.
Margot Frank was one of them...
...throwing her family, like so many, into crisis.
The agonies at that moment were when you had some youngsters saying:
"Labor won't floor me. I'm strong.
I can do whatever's asked of me.
I'm going and that's it. "
And the parents would say, "No, stay.
It's going to be the end of your life. "
So you saw the family in tension.
Then you had other families where a youngster would say:
"I don't want to go. I'm scared. What will happen?" The parents would say:
"You must go. Remember, grandmother lives with us and the baby.
If you don't go, we'll be punished. "
And you saw the families really...
...torn asunder by these events.
And that was terrible.
Nine years after fleeing Germany, the Franks were on the run again.
By 7:30 on Monday, the 6th of July, 1942...
...the whole family had disappeared...
...leaving behind an elaborate false trail...
...indicating they had fled to Switzerland.
We came here...
...and the kitchen was not...
The kitchen was just left like it was...
...with everything dirty in the sink.
I went into her room, and I saw her bed not made.
And the shoes that she loved, she'd just received them for the summer...
...were near the bed.
I came here, you see.
I went up, and I am ringing and ringing and ringing...
...and nobody opens.
And at the end somebody opened.
It was a tenant. Mr. Goudschmidt.
He had the room at the roof in the Frank apartment.
He looked at me as if he'd never seen me before.
And I didn't know what happened.
He said, "What do you want?"
"I come to play as usual. " And he said:
"Yes, but don't you know? The Frank family left for Switzerland. "
Miep Gies had been given the responsibility of getting Margot...
...who was now in flight from the Germans, to the hiding place.
I took Margot by bicycle.
Monday morning, very raining.
And that was good for us because the German...
...came not on street.
And I came with her to the Prinsengracht 263...
...go up with her.
She was very...
-Upset?
-Yes. She was very upset.
I saw it.
And when I was standing with her in front of the hiding place...
...I was afraid that she would...
...fall down.
And what could I do with her?
I opened the door and put her in.
Despite Otto's carefully laid plans...
...on their first day there, the family was surrounded by chaos.
When I come there, it was terrible.
Nothing was okay.
And Mrs. Frank and Margot were sitting down on the bed.
They could not do anything.
There was...
They couldn't accept this situation.
But Anne and Mr. Frank were busy, very busy.
I ask Mrs. Frank,
"Can I do something for you?"
"No," said Mrs. Frank.
"For today, I have all the things. "
And then I went down.
But the next day, when I came, all was okay.
-So Anne and Mr. Frank-?
-Were busy the whole day.
Was this typical of the family?
Yes. That was typical for the family.
Now the family was dependent on Otto Frank's four employees...
...who had volunteered to help them survive.
Johannes Kleiman and Viktor Kugler supplied Anne and Margot...
...with school books and other reading matter...
...at the same time, ensuring the Opekta
Company continued to function...
...even producing record profits that could be used to keep everyone alive.
Miep Gies and her assistant, the 23-year-old typist, Bep Voskuijl...
...had the dangerous task of supplying the residents of the annex with food...
...purchased on the black market or with forged or stolen ration books.
In one of her first diary entries in hiding...
...Anne described her new home to her imaginary friend:
"Thursday, July 9, 1942.
Dear Kitty:
Our secret annex is at the back of the building.
There's just one small step in front of the door, and then you're inside.
Straight ahead of you is a steep flight of stairs.
To the left is a narrow hallway opening onto a room...
...that serves as the Frank family's living room and bedroom.
Next door is a smaller room:
The bedroom and study of the two young ladies of the family.
To the right of the stairs is a windowless washroom with a sink.
The door in the corner leads to the toilet...
...and another one to Margot's and my room.
If you go up the stairs and open the door at the top...
...you're surprised to see such a light and spacious room...
...in an old canal house like this.
It contains a stove and a sink.
This will be the kitchen and bedroom for Mr. and Mrs. van Pels...
...as well as the general living room, dining room and study for us all.
A tiny side room is to be
Peter van Pels' bedroom.
Then just as in the front part of the building...
...there's an attic and a loft. "
As they settled into their confinement, the chimes of the Westerkerk clock...
...seemed to act as a constant reminder of the world they had left behind them.
Before long, the entrance to the hiding place was disguised...
...as a bookcase.
But in every respect, what lay behind those innocuous files...
...was untypical of the shelter provided to other Jews.
It was relatively spacious, within a city.
There were people outside dedicated to helping and protecting them.
Most families were torn apart...
...but here, all four of the Franks could stay together.
A week later, they were joined by their friends the van Pelses.
Miep Gies visited each day.
When I came here from this door...
...in the middle was standing the table with the chairs.
All the people, seven people...
...were standing in the line here.
Did not say any word.
Did not say any word...
...but waited for me to begin.
It was always an awful moment for me...
...because I felt the dependence...
...from these people of us, the helpers.
Except Anne. Anne was in the front.
She asked, "Hello, Miep, what is the news?"
In those early months,
Anne was desperately lonely...
...and always hoping for news of her friends.
She even invented a correspondence with one of them.
"September 25, 1942.
Dear Jacqueline:
I'm writing this letter in order to bid you goodbye.
I can't write to everyone, and that's why I'm just writing to you.
I'd be grateful if you'd be really nice...
...and keep up a secret correspondence with me.
All inquiries to Mrs. Gies.
I hope we'll meet again soon...
...but it probably won't be before the end of the war.
Well, then, Jackie,
I hope things go well with you...
...and that I hear from you soon.
Your best friend, Anne.
P. S.:
I hope that we'll always stay best friends until we meet again.
Bye. "
I think that she wrote it immediately...
...after she went into hiding.
And afterwards, at that moment in September, she wrote it down.
She invented in that my answer to her.
And then she wrote a second letter...
...in answer to this invented letter.
And she must have been very lonely that she invented these letters.
Anne also wrote a long fantasy in which she imagined living with her cousin...
...in the safety of Switzerland.
When I think that when Anne wrote about Switzerland and about me...
Bernd Elias
...it must have been a painful thought to her...
...to realize that she was like a bird in a cage...
...and we, over here in Switzerland...
...were free to do anything we wanted to do.
And all her dreams...
...were caged in.
And we, the boys, her cousins...
...could fulfill everything she was dreaming of.
It must have been a very, very hard thing for her.
In the diary, she even designs a skating dress...
-... so she can be your skating partner.
-Yes.
Yes, when I saw that the first time...
...it really overwhelmed me.
It made me cry, to be very honest.
Especially then that I knew she was not alive anymore when I saw it.
I would have loved to go skating with her.
Anne also addressed her diary entries to a circle of imaginary friends...
...all characters from a well-known series of books for adolescent girls.
Eventually, she settled on one friend, Kitty...
...as her diary correspondent.
Anne was always a very curious child.
When I was upstairs and went away...
...she'd always wait till the last to speak with me.
And then she had me.
And she asked everything what happened outside.
And I told her the truth.
The terrible truth.
"November 19, 1942.
Dearest Kitty:
Countless friends and acquaintances have been taken off to a dreadful fate.
Night after night, green and gray military vehicles...
...cruise the streets.
In the evenings, when it's dark...
...I often see long lines of good, innocent people...
...accompanied by crying children, walking on and on.
No one is spared.
The sick, the elderly, children...
...babies and pregnant women all are marched to their death.
I get frightened when I think of close friends who are now at the mercy...
...of the cruelest monsters to stalk the earth.
And all because they're Jews. "
Bloeme Evers-Emden
Margot's classmate
At the beginning of the class of '41, we had about 50 children.
The deportations began in July '42.
And then from 50 children...
...all the time, children disappeared.
When you came in your class, you said:
"That child's missing and that one and that one. "
You did hope they were ill.
But you knew that they were round up...
...or maybe they were hidden.
At the end of the school year...
...in April '43...
...there were three children left...
...two boys and I.
And we did our final examination...
...together.
The second part of the final examination, I was alone.
It was very sad.
Very difficult.
From 50 children, one remained at the end of the year?
While the roundups of their friends continued outside...
...in their hiding place,
Anne and the others...
...tried to establish a kind of normality.
"Dear Kitty:
Up to now, our bedroom with its blank walls was very bare.
Thanks to Father, who brought my entire...
...post card and movie star collection here beforehand...
...and to a brush and a pot of glue...
...I was able to plaster the walls with pictures. "
We were both collecting pictures...
...from the children of the queen.
Here you see Elizabeth, today Queen Elizabeth...
...and her sister Margaret.
And I also was collecting, and we would change together.
We had from Belgium...
From all the queens in the world, we would change pictures.
I liked it very much. Anne was also collecting from film stars.
This I wasn't interested in at all.
I only remember she had
Deanna Durbin. This one.
This is the only one I remember from then. I never saw a film.
I don't remember if Anne saw films.
We went to see Shirley Temple films.
And here in Amsterdam, we had a cinema, Cineac.
There you could see one hour a little film and news.
And then it started.
Over there, we would go very often.
Four months after going into hiding, an 8th person joined the annex...
...a 54-year-old German dentist,
Fritz Pfeffer.
Margot slept on a folding bed with her parents.
And Anne had to share her room with the newcomer.
Look, Mr. Pfeffer was my dentist.
And Mr. Pfeffer asked me always:
"Miep, do you have a place for me?"
Then I went next day...
...in the hiding place and tell it to Mr. Frank and the other peoples.
They listened to me.
Next day, Mr. Frank said:
"Miep, where seven people can eat...
...can eight also eat. "
Pfeffer moved into Anne's bedroom...
...complete with his drill and dental implements.
While no one would now lack treatment of their cavities...
...relations between the 54-year-old disciplinarian...
...and the free spirit in her early teens...
...were inevitably stormy.
On this corner...
...it was the desk...
...for Anne...
...and Pfeffer.
There this...
This gave sometimes troubles with Anne.
Anne was standing on her rights.
From so till so is her time.
But I believe Mr. Pfeffer...
...did not see the importance of a diary...
...for a little child.
"Him and his lies.
I'll smack his ugly mug so hard, he'll go bouncing off the wall.
Anyone who is so petty and pedantic at the age of 54 was born that way...
...and is never going to change. "
What Anne never knew was that Fritz Pfeffer had a son...
...whom he had raised as a single parent in Germany...
...until sending him to England after Kristallnacht in 1938.
A few weeks later, Pfeffer himself fled to Amsterdam...
...with his fiancee, Charlotte.
But his 11-year-old son never saw his father again.
Peter Pepper
Fritz Pfeffer's son
We're talking about a girl under very difficult circumstances...
...who first of all decided that my father was not a nice man.
Therefore, she called him Dr. Dussel, which in English is "idiot. "
As far as my point of view...
...retrospectively to the age of 11 and below...
...there's a very large inaccuracy.
First of all, my father, although being a very strict man...
...was a very kind man.
What other people don't recognize...
...is his love of life, his love of freedom.
My father was a sportsman.
He loved to row.
He loved to ride horses.
He liked to climb mountains.
So if you take a man who's always been active all his life...
...and then in flight he ends up here...
...it's like caging a bird.
Weekly, Mrs. Miep Gies would bring a package containing letters...
...and other personal messages from Charlotte Karletta.
And weekly, she would take a letter from him to her.
What do you feel now about what that may have meant for your father?
What it meant for my father...
...is that it is a thin lifeline.
A thin lifeline that was the only hope of expression...
...and relationship.
Because with Charlotte's letters to him...
...expressing her love, her feelings...
...her news, whatever it was in those letters...
...is the only thing where my father would have...
...the semblance of mental health.
Because you're a prisoner of your own mind.
For the first time, Fritz Pfeffer's son meets his father's protector.
Mr. Pfeffer.
How do you do?
Fine.
I was a very good friend of your father.
Do you understand German?
I came into contact with him every day.
He was my dentist, exceptionally good.
He asked me if I could help him...
...find a place, and so I helped him.
Unbelievable.
Nice to meet you.
He was a lovely, lovely man.
Do you speak English?
Very bad.
Shall we try German?
Yes, if that's okay, it would be better.
What would you like to know?
I just want to say...
...two words.
Many thanks.
Two months after this meeting,
Peter Pepper died of cancer.
If Anne reserved her special venom for Fritz Pfeffer...
...with the claustrophobia of the months in hiding that turned into years...
...all the adults at one time or another were subjected to the fury of her pen.
"September 27, 1942.
Some people, like the van Pelses, take delight not only...
...in raising their own children...
...but in helping others raise theirs.
Margot doesn't need it since she is naturally good...
...kind and clever, perfection itself.
But I seem to have enough mischief for the two of us.
More than once, the air's been filled with the van Pels' admonitions...
...and my saucy replies.
They tell me I should talk less, mind my own business and be more modest.
But I seem doomed to failure. "
Otto, the ever-indulgent father, was frequently called in...
...to act as a peacemaker between Anne and the others.
Her adoration of him was matched only by her increasing problems...
...with her mother.
"I cling to Father because my contempt of Mother is growing daily.
And it is only through him that I'm able to retain...
...the last ounce of family feeling I have left.
I don't know how I should act.
I can't very well confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm...
...and her hard-heartedness.
Yet I can't continue to take the blame for everything.
I'm the opposite of Mother, so of course we clash.
She's not a mother to me.
I have to mother myself.
I'm charting my own course and will see where it leads me. "
Mrs. Frank was the most depressed of all the people.
Sometimes when I go out of the hiding place...
...the staircase downstairs...
...she went with me till the door.
I did not understand that.
What did she want of me?
And once again, I go with her in her sleeping room...
...and she closed the door, and then she said to me:
"Miep...
...I am so afraid. "
She told me all her troubles.
But what could I do?
I didn't say anything...
...because I was in the same position as she.
While Anne and her mother feuded...
...in the second year, she developed a strong passion for Peter van Pels...
...the 17-year-old boy with whom she shared her caged existence.
They spent hours together in the loft chatting...
...or simply staring out the window at the chestnut tree.
"Sunday, March 19, 1944.
I have the feeling that Peter and I share a secret.
When he looks at me with those eyes, with that smile and with that wink...
...it's as if a light goes on inside me.
I hope things stay like this...
...and we'll have many, many more happy hours together.
Your grateful and happy Anne. "
Peter van Pels was a blue-eyed boy...
...with very little intellectual capacity.
I didn't know him nearly as well as I knew Anne.
But he once came to our house when we were reading the classics...
...and he was so singularly bewildered by it...
...that I remember thinking:
"My goodness, he doesn't know a thing!"
The relationship with Peter waxed and then waned.
They cuddled and kissed, but as she noted in her diary...
...Anne gradually became dissatisfied...
...with his inability to express his feelings.
The pressures of confinement created and then crushed...
...their adolescent love affair.
In the secret annex, the claustrophobia was stifling.
The radio, broadcasting from England...
...was an essential lifeline to news from the outside world.
Every Allied victory brought hope, every defeat, gloom.
Arguments over food blew up into major rows.
And then always the ever-present threat of discovery.
The windows had to be covered by blinds, even in the heat of summer.
The toilet could only be used outside office hours.
No one could walk in shoes on the lower floor...
...for fear that the workers in the warehouse below would hear.
And always the question,
"Would they be betrayed...
...or would they betray themselves by some inadvertent error?"
To add to everyone's fears...
...the warehouse and offices under their hiding place were burgled a few times.
My father had the maintenance of the building, the daily maintenance.
Hans Wijnberg
Later I recognized that he must have been the carpenter...
...that's repairing the door...
...which is opened by the burglary in the book, in Anne Frank's diary.
I think there were two burglaries, weren't there?
Yeah. The other one was me.
What were you after?
I think it's a mixture of adventure and spices.
We found some spices.
But we had to move out...
...because we recognized people living in the house...
...because they made a mistake upstairs.
That's what I later realized.
I didn't know it was the Frank family.
We did not know.
We were not supposed to know who was living in a house...
...because of what I explained earlier.
You didn't speak about people living somewhere.
So we heard them flushing the toilet...
...so we moved out because that was a sign people were upstairs.
And well, we were not there with an agreement of anybody.
"Wednesday, March 29, 1944.
Dearest Kitty:
Mr. Bolkestein, the cabinet minister...
...speaking on the Dutch broadcast from London...
...said that after the war, a collection would be made of diaries and letters...
...dealing with the war.
Of course, everyone pounced on my diary.
Imagine how interesting it would be if I published a novel...
...about the secret annex.
The title alone would make people think it was a detective story.
Seriously though,
10 years after the war...
...people would find it very amusing to read how we lived...
...what we ate and what we talked about as Jews in hiding. "
For 6 weeks, Anne thought constantly about the message from London.
Then she made up her mind.
She had wanted to be a journalist, a famous writer, to travel the world...
...see Paris and Hollywood.
This was her opportunity.
Starting in the middle of May 1944...
...she began to furiously rewrite her whole diary from the first entry...
...with a view to future publication...
...at the same time as keeping up her regular diary entries.
"Tuesday, June 6, 1944.
Dearest Kitty:
'This is D-day, ' the BBC announced at 12.
'This is the day.
The invasion has begun. '
A huge commotion in the annex.
Is this really the beginning of the long-awaited liberation?
The liberation we've all talked so much about...
...which still seems too good, too much of a fairy tale ever to come true?
Will this year, 1944, bring us victory?
We don't know yet.
But where there's hope, there's life.
It fills us with fresh courage and makes us strong again.
The best part of the invasion...
...is that I have the feeling that friends are on the way.
Those terrible Germans have oppressed and threatened us for so long...
...that the thought of friends and salvation...
...means everything to us.
Maybe, Margot says...
...I can even go back to school...
...in October or September. "
With the Allies advancing, the spirits in the annex soared.
Otto Frank kept a map...
...tracking every advance of the British and American troops.
But the odds were stacked against those in the hiding place.
Of the 25,000 Jews who hid from the Nazis in Holland during WWII...
...some 8 to 9 thousand were discovered by the Germans...
...or betrayed by their Dutch hosts.
Many of the Franks' neighbors, some of whom were known Nazi sympathizers...
...knew there was something going on in the back house...
...at 263 Prinsengracht.
Anyone could've called the authorities to collect the reward...
...for betraying Jews in hiding.
Anne herself chronicled many acts of carelessness...
...that could've led to the suspicion that could easily lead on to betrayal.
It has never been proved how they were betrayed...
...but on a sunny summer morning in 1944...
...two years after they first stepped behind their secret door...
...their world collapsed.
It was the 4th of August...
You know, it was always my task to go first...
...up in the hiding place.
Also this day.
I go up, took my shopping list...
...talked with the people...
...and came down.
After an hour, I was working in the office.
Bep in front of me,
Koophuis on this side.
The door...
...goes open, but I did not look.
And it was quiet.
In a moment, I look up...
...and there was a man standing before me with a gun to me...
...and said:
"Quiet. No words. "
Was there ever a plan...
...for this sort of situation?
No. No.
We were so...
...sure that it never would happen.
The authorities were alerted by an anonymous phone call...
...that there were Jews hiding in the Opekta offices.
Four Dutch policemen from the German security service...
...led by an Austrian officer, went straight to the secret bookcase.
I could hear the voice of the Nazi.
And I heard this man...
...speak with a...
...with a Vienna accent.
And if you know, I'm born in Vienna.
I know that accent.
I stand up and say to him...
...in a nearly friendly mien:
"You are a Vienna.
I'm a Vienna too. "
And this one sentence...
...was perhaps too much for this man.
He was standing there...
...looked at me.
And when he come to him-
He come to me...
...so near to me that I feel his...
...his adem.
His breath, I feel his breath.
"Aren't you ashamed of yourself...
...helping Jewish baggage?
You deserve to receive...
...the worst punishment.
And you know what that is. "
I did not say any word.
I was...
He was going in my office from the one wall to the other...
...as a wild...
...animal.
Animal.
After a while, he stood still...
...looked me a little friendlier.
"Out of personal sympathy, you may stay...
...but woe betide you if you flee.
Then we'll take your husband. "
When the Germans captured
Jews in hiding...
...they looted everything of value.
Officially, this was meant to finance the transportation of the Jews...
...to the Polish death camps.
But corruption was rife...
...and Jewish valuables often lined the pockets of Nazi policemen.
Needing a container for his loot...
...the Austrian arresting officer, SS
Oberscharführer Karl Silberbauer...
...emptied the contents of Otto
Frank's briefcase onto the floor.
And thus, he left behind
Anne's diary.
After the Franks and the other peoples were away...
...I come here in...
...and found...
...the diary scattered on the floor.
Ellie and me, Bep and me.
Bep and me, we saw this.
"That is the diary of Anne!"
"Please take! Take it!"
We took all the things...
...but I was afraid...
...that I had not all the paper of the diary. I knew that.
But I was so in hurry...
...because I was afraid that this Austrian man came again.
-That the officer-
-That the officer...
Because he say,
"I come back. "
Within two weeks of Miep Gies saving Anne's diary...
...the Dutch firm of A-Puls stripped the hiding place of its possessions...
...to be sent to Germany to aid bombed-out German civilians.
Silberbauer and his assistants had taken the eight Jewish prisoners...
...to Gestapo headquarters, housed here in a former school in Amsterdam.
Of the helpers, Johannes Kleiman and Viktor Kugler were also arrested.
Though not the two women,
Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl.
Kleiman and Kugler were then sent here...
...to Amersfoort labor camp in Holland...
...shown in this film during a Dutch Red Cross inspection.
Kleiman was released in September due to bad health...
...and Kugler managed to escape in 1945...
...when the train in which he...
...was being transported to Germany was bombed by American planes.
The day after the arrest of the Franks, the van Pelses and Pfeffer...
...Miep tried one last desperate effort to help them.
I go to the Gestapo.
And when you dare go in...
...you did not know if you come out.
I found this Austrian man...
...and he said, "Yes, come. "
I went to him.
But when I came there, his office was full of young people.
Secretaries and all the peoples.
But he was sitting in the corner.
And when I came in, I could not-
I think...
..."I cannot speak with this man what I want. "
So I go to the corner to him...
...over his desk, and I did so:
"Understand me," I said to him.
"Please come back tomorrow.
I can't do anything more for you today. "
And then I went away.
Next morning, I go to him.
He was standing in the door...
...waiting for me.
"I am sorry," he said to me.
"I can't do anything for you...
...because I am not high enough.
You understand me?"
And I said to him,
"I don't believe you. "
"Go to my boss. "
And I go upstairs.
I knocked on the door.
Nobody said anything.
Then I opened the door, and what did I see?
A large table...
...sitting high German people.
Their caps on the table, and in the middle...
...the radio, listening to England.
That was very, very-
Was not allowed for the German people.
And it was very dangerous for me...
...because I saw what they did.
And I said, "Who is he, the boss?"
One man came to me, pushed me out of the door.
"You are a swine. "
And then I went down.
And this Vienna man was standing in the door.
I said, "What did I say to you?"
And then I went down...
...and I feel...
...the curtain of this play was fallen for me.
Afterfour days in the cellars of the Gestapo building...
...the prisoners were taken to the Amsterdam railway depot.
They were loaded under guard onto an ordinary passenger train.
Janny Brilleslijper, a member of the Dutch Resistance...
...was amongst the prisoners.
What I saw was a family.
There were a number of people...
...a very worried father and a nervous mother...
...and two children...
...wearing sports clothes, I believe.
Of course, it is more than fifty years ago.
They had sports clothes on...
...and backpacks with them...
...and the four of them...
...stayed together constantly.
They spoke very softly to one another...
...and there were other people there.
It was a beautiful day...
...the sun shone to greet you...
...the houses of the city were bathed in gold...
...and those people all had a sort of...
...silent melancholy about them.
Nobody said anything.
I cannot say that the people were afraid.
We went to meet the unknown.
We didn't know what was waiting for us.
This was the first destination for the Franks and the other prisoners.
Westerbork Transit Camp in northern Holland.
This film was made by the commandant...
...to show his superiors in Berlin how successful he was...
...in keeping his prisoners occupied...
...before sending them on to less benign places in Poland or Germany.
104,000 people were processed through here...
...between 1942 and 1945...
...more than 75% of the Jews in Holland...
...before the outbreak of war.
Proudly, and without irony, the commandant showed...
...the humiliation of his prisoners...
...who were largely ignorant of the fate that awaited them.
Of the 60,000 or so who were sent to Auschwitz from here...
...only 673 were ever to return.
And of the 34,313 transported to Sobibor death camp...
...just 19 came back.
In the meantime, Westerbork offered ball games and calisthenics.
The Jews were encouraged to entertain themselves with a weekly cabaret.
Three survivors of that time in August 1944...
...returned for the first time in 50 years.
All, like the Franks, had been captured in hiding.
It is maybe unbelievable...
...but when we were arrested and brought to the prison...
Sal de Liema
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
...I cannot say it was a kind of relief. No.
But there was something that we said:
"Now this is maybe the end of the war. "
Because we knew the invasion was going on...
...and, "The end is finally in sight.
What we have to do now is try to survive this. "
It was overwhelming.
I knew it was Westerbork.
Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder
Westerbork Prisoner June/Sept 1944
I thought, "This is the end," because
I knew what happened in Germany.
And I knew that they were going to kill us.
We never gave up hope that we would survive the war.
Rose de Liema
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
There was not that much
Gestapo supervision in the camps.
The first ones I saw were the Franks.
I knew Margot rather well...
Bloeme Evers-Emden
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
...and I knew Anne.
We said to each other,
"You too, here? You too?
Were you hidden? What happened?"
But very soon you were taken inside the camp...
...and you had to be registered...
...and you got your wooden shoes...
...because we were punished, because we were hidden.
For me, it was the best time of the war.
No hunger, nice boys.
Frieda Menco
Westerbork Prisoner July/Sept 1944
We worked during the daytime.
Wasn't bad.
Then we got food...
...and we were standing around and making jokes with each other.
Like other prisoners, the eight...
...were given make-work jobs by their captors.
The Franks had the task of breaking up old batteries for recycling.
Otto Frank wanted something better for his Anne.
I was cleaning a table...
...and then at once, somebody came to me...
...with a girl-
That was Otto Frank.
Later on, I knew it.
He was with Anne, and he asked me:
"Here's Anne, my daughter.
Do you have work for her?"
Because he wanted, of course, her to be inside with us.
Then she said to me, "I can help you.
I'm very handy. I can do everything. "
This was the end, actually.
This was it.
It all started here.
My grandparents...
...all my uncles, my aunts, my nieces, my nephews...
...all my friends.
They came here, and it was the beginning of the end.
And I really...
...feel like this is...
...a big cemetery.
In the end, you start to believe that it won't happen.
You know that there are transports going each Tuesday.
But when two months have passed...
...and your own name wasn't on the list, you start to believe:
"We can stay here until the end of the war. "
Because by then of course, we knew that there would be an end.
Although it was incredible, but we knew...
...that the English and the Americans were already in Europe.
And then it came, and you became very factual.
You took your things, everything-
You got back what belonged to you...
...because they had taken that away from you...
...because they gave you that outfit.
It was like what happened so many times later. It was like having-
I don't know how you call it. You don't quite realize what's going on...
...and what will happen with you and to you.
Eighty-three trains left Westerbork during the second World War...
...for the Polish death camps of Auschwitz and Sobibor.
On September 3, 1944, they loaded many of the Jews in Westerbork...
...onto the very last transport to Auschwitz.
1019 men, women and children...
...amongst them, the group of eight from the secret annex.
For most, it was to be their last sight of Holland.
Darkness...
...is the first thing I think about.
Being cramped in.
Too many people.
No room enough.
Luggage.
No possibility to lie.
Sitting for three days.
Now and then standing.
You were like in a trance.
You didn't realize.
You realized that very bad things were to happen...
...and to be completely powerless.
Sometimes we stood up. We got up...
...and looked through cracks...
...when we were at a station when the train stopped.
Because we still had no idea how we went and where it would end...
...and how long it would take.
People cried, and on the other side, they told stories to each other...
...to try to sleep, to sleep standing.
There was not enough food and drink.
We were, I think, about 40 or 50 people...
...in that cattle car.
We were standing.
Sometimes we got to our knees to rest a little bit.
Urinating and other things.
I don't remember what we did, but there was nothing there, nothing.
I think we just let it go.
And it was like an endless journey.
And even that was better than that there would have come an end to it.
Because the end was not good.
That, we felt.
Your imagination stops...
...at certain moments.
You refuse to imagine the worst.
On September 5, the train from
Holland reached its final destination:
Auschwitz death camp in southwest Poland.
All those lamps.
Terrible, terrible hard.
The color was so terrible.
It was yellowish.
And we came there, men, women, children alike...
...on the platform here.
Don't know where exactly.
Yeah, I see there, the rail.
We were astonished.
I really thought I passed away, and this was hell.
Really, I thought, "I'm already dead. "
We were driven one way or another way.
After all, was the one way to the death...
...and this was to a kind of life.
I remember very well too...
...that you were naked before men...
...and I was educated chastely...
...in the values of my people.
And I got a shock.
I knew that from this moment on...
...all your norms and values...
...were of no importance anymore.
And that there was a quite new...
...set of values to be learned.
And if you didn't learn it, you would be dead.
I remember that I realized it in one second.
And I was only 18 years old.
According to Auschwitz records, more than half the people on that train...
...were gassed on the day after their arrival, September 6.
549 Jews, among them...
...every child under the age of 15.
They told us right away what was waiting for us: death.
"All of your people, they're going to the chimneys. Maybe tonight already. "
It was just a death factory.
We knew.
We saw that terrible pipe...
...burning day and night.
The smell. I thought that when it should come here...
...that I should have had a penetrant smell. But no.
I was sure that I should smell it because sometimes I smell it.
The smell of the disinfection, the smell of the burning flesh...
...and the smoke.
Anne, Margot and Edith Frank, and Mrs. van Pels...
...were among the 212 women from the Dutch train...
...who were granted entry into that hell they called Auschwitz-Birkenau.
They were placed in Women's Block 29.
It was no life.
It was no life at all.
We were degraded...
...to even less than beasts.
Less than animals.
We were standing outside, and I saw a wagon on the first day.
"What's he throwing on there?"
Dead bodies. Oh, my God!
I could hardly look.
The next couple of days later, I saw it.
"Oh, there's that wagon again who picks up the dead bodies. "
The next time, I didn't pay any attention to that wagon.
So your brain starts functioning differently...
...because if you didn't-
You didn't do it on purpose...
...but then you couldn't go on living.
In Auschwitz-Birkenau, Edith Frank and her daughters...
...were drawn together as never before.
A very important survival...
...for all the people in concentration camps...
...were the forming of groups.
Support groups.
And of course, as mother and children and daughters...
...you were a natural support group.
And I think everything from the past was faded away...
...against this scene of Auschwitz.
It was of no importance anymore, I suppose.
Was there any sign of the previous antagonism...
...between Anne and her mother?
I think it was all forgotten.
They were always together.
You can have the luxury...
...of a struggle with your mother in normal circumstances.
These circumstances were so...
...bad. Not only bad...
...but like a ghost writing...
...that everything fell away.
I'm quite sure about that.
The last time I saw Anne and Margot and Mrs. Frank...
...was when there had been a selection...
...for a working camp.
But you never knew for what the selection was.
But Anne and her mother were told...
...that Anne was not allowed to go with our group...
...because she had scabies.
Her mother and Margot decided to stay with Anne.
We went to a labor camp where we...
...didn't get food and worked hard...
...but most of us survived.
There were few deaths, and there were no gas chambers.
Had she not had the scabies...
...and had they gone with our transport...
...they had had a better chance to survive.
So because Anne suffered from scabies...
...and her mother and sister stayed with her...
...they lost their chance to leave
Auschwitz for the work camp...
...where many of the Dutch women saw out the remainder of the war.
As for the men, when they had first arrived at Auschwitz, September 5...
...Otto Frank, Hermann and
Peter van Pels, and Fritz Pfeffer...
...together with the other 254 males who had not immediately been gassed...
...had been separated from their women and taken to the nearby Auschwitz I.
This, the original death camp created from an old Polish army barracks...
...may have been smaller than
Auschwitz-Birkenau...
...where the women had remained within sight of the gas chambers...
...and three crematoria, but life here for the men was no easier.
Mr. van Pels was the first to wither.
We told him, "Don't give up. "
He did, and it was just like he melted away. It was two weeks-
Two days, he was gone.
He gave up.
That was it.
No one knows exactly when they took
Hermann van Pels to the gas chamber...
...but it was only a few weeks after his arrival at Auschwitz.
Otto Frank and Sal de Liema resolved...
...to keep up their morale by whatever means.
People around us...
...like we all were, of course very nervous.
Talking about food all the time.
Talking about clothes...
...that we didn't have any, practically no clothes.
Only the striped clothes that we had.
The food was just a piece of bread that they'd give you. It was really bad.
So Mr. Frank and I-
We knew each other from Westerbork.
He said, "We should get away from those people...
...because if you start talking about food and everything...
...your brain is gonna go. "
And we said, "We understand that physically...
...we maybe will not survive this. "
We should try to...
...survive mentally...
...and talk about things that had nothing to do with the camp, like:
"Do you remember the melody from the 9th Symphony from Beethoven?"
And then we start singing to each other...
...just to get away from this fear.
Just to get our brain...
...thinking about other things.
We talked about van Gogh, Rembrandt.
"Ever go to the Van Gogh Museum?
Ever go to the Rijk Museum?"
And all those things, just not to-
To get out of our minds.
To get out of this here.
And it really helped, I think.
He was older, much older than I was.
He said, "You know, why don't you call me Papa Frank...
...because I have to have something in my life...
...that I can be a papa to. "
I didn't know what he was talking about.
I said, "What do you mean?
I have a father...
...and he is hidden in the Netherlands, in Holland.
If you do it for me, you don't have to, because I have already a father...
...and he's alive.
I know he's hidden. "
"No," he said, "you do it for me.
I'm the type of a man, I need this.
I need somebody to be a papa for. "
So I told him, "If it will help you, I'll do that. "
He said, "Call me Papa Frank. " Until he died, when he wrote his letters...
...he always signed his letters,
"Papa Frank. "
I was standing one time in the snow...
...naked...
...after we came back from our work.
We stand appell here, outside here...
...and a German soldier came...
...and he had his fur coat on and he looked at me and said:
"Cold, huh? It is cold?"
I didn't even answer.
I just looked at him.
And he said, "You know you will not survive this, you know that.
But in case you will survive-
But I'll take care of it that it's not gonna happen.
Nobody, but nobody will believe you...
...what we did to you people. Nobody. "
Otto Frank interviewed in 1979
One day in Auschwitz,
I was very depressed.
I had been beaten the day before...
...and that had really affected me...
...also in terms of my morale.
It was a Sunday morning...
...and I said, "I can't get up. "
And then my comrades...
...all Dutchmen of course...
...because I was the only German...
...among Dutchmen...
...but I was totally accepted by the others...
...they said to me,
"That's not possible...
...you must get up, otherwise you are lost. "
And then they went to a Dutch doctor...
...who worked with a German doctor...
...and this Dutch doctor...
...came to me in my barracks.
He said, "Get up and come...
...tomorrow morning to the sick barracks...
...and I'll speak to the German doctor...
...so that you will be accepted. "
And that is what happened...
...and through that I was saved.
While Otto languished in a sick barracks...
...his daughters were transported away.
On October 28, 1944, they were separated from their mother...
...and together with 1308 other women, they were sent here...
...to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.
Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder was with them.
You see with your own eyes how beautiful it is. It is beautiful.
And there were birds here.
And I wanted to be a bird.
Freedom, freedom, freedom.
I thought, "Oh, how nice to be a bird.
You can fly wherever you go. "
I was simply jealous of birds.
When Anne, Margot, Rachel and the others arrived at Bergen-Belsen...
...the camp was overflowing...
...with new inmates brought from throughout Europe.
The barracks being built to accommodate them were not ready...
...and they were crammed into the makeshift shelter of tents.
On November 7, a violent storm raged through the camp...
...destroying many of these.
Seeking shelter from the rain...
...Anne and Margot encountered
Lientje and Janny Brilleslijper...
...the two Dutch sisters whom they knew from Auschwitz and Westerbork.
It stormed, it hailed.
We had walked four kilometers...
...and we sat together...
...the two of us...
...with only our two little faces...
...sticking out of two blankets.
Those dark horse blankets...
...with our heads together...
...and only our two little faces...
...like two heaps on a little hill...
...up against a tree...
...to stay as dry as possible.
And four legs came walking up...
...also with blankets around them...
...and over their heads.
And at the same time as we saw them...
...we all threw off our blankets with a shout...
"Oh, how wonderful that you are here. "
How can you find something wonderful...
...in the middle of a concentration camp?
Deliberately starved, frozen and racked with disease...
...Bergen-Belsen was no place to be in those last months of World War II.
A wooden barracks was found for the unfortunate women from Auschwitz.
But Anne and Margot Frank came to be in the worst position of all:
In the lower bunk next to the door.
Incapable of protecting themselves...
...from the vicious wind that swept through Bergen-Belsen's barren acres.
They shouted, "Close the door!
Close the door!
It is cold! It is cold!
It is cold!"
And it was terrible for them, of course.
What did the Frank girls look like when you saw them in the barracks?
Very terrible. Terrible. Sick.
Thin. No hair.
Their eyes, very big. Very big eyes because they were so thin.
Almost impossible to imagine...
...but there was a time when the name Bergen-Belsen...
...brought hope to the eyes of Jews due to be transported here.
In the early years, the Nazis planned it as a camp for Jews...
...who might be used for exchange for German prisoners of war.
In those long ago days, Anne's friend
Lies Goslar had been sent here...
...with her sister and father, the former
German government minister.
In 1945, Lies discovered she was in the compound...
...next to the Dutch women from Auschwitz.
One day, a friend of mine tells me:
"You know, between all these women, there is your friend, Anne Frank. "
I don't know, I felt very crazy...
...because I was thinking the whole time:
"Anne is safe in Switzerland. "
I was sure of this. This was what the tenant said to me.
And so I had no choice to go also near this barbed wire.
This was not allowed, and the German in the watchtower was watching us.
And you know he would have shot if he would have caught us.
So we couldn't see. I told you there were barbed wire with straw...
...and we couldn't see the other side.
So I just went near at dark...
...and I start to call,
"Hello? Hello?" Something like this.
And who answered me was Mrs. van Pels.
Maybe the Dutch women went near the barbed wire...
...because the others didn't know anybody. I don't know.
I didn't even ask her, "How are you?"
I knew her, but not very good.
But immediately she said to me,
"You want Anne?" And I said, "Yes. "
And she says, "You know,
I will call her for you.
Margot I can't call for you.
She's very sick already.
But Anne I will call for you. "
And so I was standing there in the cold, and I was waiting.
And then suddenly, I heard somebody calling me...
...and it was Anne.
And this was awful.
The first thing, we both started to cry. Then I said:
"What are you doing here?
You are in Switzerland. "
And she answered me, "We wanted this rumor to go around...
...because we hoped then the Germans will not look after us. "
And then she said she had nobody anymore.
And this was not right, and I am so very sorry because she said:
"My mother is dead. " And her mother really was dead at that moment...
...but she couldn't know. She was sure her mother was killed when she left.
But her mother came out later, was not killed...
...she just died of exhaustion in the beginning of January.
Her sister, she knew, was very, very sick already.
But now her father.
Look, if it was Mengele or somebody else...
...they wouldn't know how old you are.
They would see only naked bodies.
And Mr. Frank was 55 years old...
...but he was only one month in the Dutch camp...
...so he looked still very good.
And the Germans just looked and saw somebody that still can walk...
...so they sent him to the right, to live.
But Anne thought they go by the age, and she was sure of it.
"My father is dead. He is an old man. "
And I always think, if she had known her father is still alive-
After her sister died, she just was without any hope.
Then maybe she had-
You know, it was only...
...one month she died before the liberation.
But she didn't know, and so she had really nothing to live for.
At this time, as a special prisoner being kept for possible exchange...
...Lies Goslar received a parcel from the Red Cross.
My friends, everybody gave me a glove or a little sock and a little bread.
So I came back at night with such a small package.
And then I hear her again, and we were speaking.
I told her about my little sister.
I told her my mother wasn't alive anymore. She didn't know.
Miep only told her that my-
That the baby died.
And my father was then already in hospital.
He died 25 of February, and this was before.
And I throw the package over...
...and then I heard her crying or shouting.
And I couldn't understand.
"What happened?"
"The lady next to me caught the package, and she run away with it. "
And she didn't give her anything.
I said, "I will try for another time. "
And really, I tried another time.
And this time she caught the package.
And it was the last time I saw her.
More than 50,000 of Bergen-Belsen's inmates died in 1945...
...as disease and starvation ravaged the camp.
Typhus, carried by lice, was a particularly horrible killer.
It is terrible when you are covered in lice.
Anne had thrown away her clothes...
...and she came to us crying...
...wrapped only in her gray blanket.
Lientje (my sister) lay sick...
...and I couldn't do anything...
...except give Anne some clothes to wear...
...and give her some delousing material.
And I promised to come to her the next day...
...to come to both of them...
...because she said,
"You have to come.
Margot is so ill. "
At that time...
...Margot was already mortally sick.
I suppose she also had typhus.
I'm not sure.
But the next day,
I couldn't get away...
...and it took at least four or five days...
...before I went to her...
...and then they were already dead.
Both dead.
And all of a sudden...
...I didn't see them anymore.
But you would not pay attention.
The place was empty.
We were sick.
And when I was ill, to speak about myself...
...is why I couldn't pay more attention than I did.
They're not there anymore.
They are dead.
That was that.
Outside in the entry guard...
...all of them were swept away.
Boom. They are outside.
I don't know whether I can talk about it.
Meat was traded...
...bodies.
It's very difficult...
Leave it.
I can't say any more.
The bodies from our barracks...
...we almost couldn't lift them anymore.
They were thrown onto a pile...
...between the barracks...
...and inscribed on my eyes...
...are these people...
...in every possible position...
...in every possible form...
...covered in snow...
...completely naked...
...because they would always be undressed.
On a pile with wide open eyes.
We tried to close as many eyes as possible.
It didn't always work.
Bergen-Belsen, as filmed by British liberators:
A place where humanity had been reduced to the worst indignities.
Cannibalism became part of a desperate struggle...
...to quench the most appalling hunger.
Only a few hundred yards away...
...the Germans kept supplies of food and medicine...
...while their prisoners died by the tens of thousands.
In November 1943, a year and a half before her death...
...in the safety of her
Amsterdam hiding place...
...Anne Frank had a nightmare in which
Hanneli Goslar appeared before her.
Hanneli Goslar in a concentration camp.
"I saw her there, dressed in rags...
...her face thin and worn.
She looked at me with such sadness and reproach in her enormous eyes...
...that I could read the message in them:
'Oh, Anne, why have you deserted me?
Help me, help me.
Rescue me from this hell. '
And I can't help her.
I can only stand by and watch...
...while other people suffer and die.
All I can do is pray to God to bring her back to us.
If only I could help her.
Dear God, I have everything
I could wish for...
...while fate has her in its deadly clutches.
Hanneli, Hanneli. If only
I could take you away.
If only I could share everything I have with you.
It's too late, but I'll never forget her again...
...and I'll always pray for her.
Yours, Anne. "
She didn't do so much wrong, you know, if you are in this age.
But this is one of the reasons that I tell the story now...
...because it is the other way around.
Yes, today I am standing here, and she is dead.
And so I am quite obliged to tell about her.
And she wanted to be so very famous.
I can't help a lot of this but a little bit.
I think, "What a waste, such a young life should end...
...and without any reason. "
She could really have given something to the world.
The whole thing is crazy.
My father died there one week after I saw her.
I don't know.
I cannot judge this whole period.
Nobody can understand it, I think.
I don't know.
Auschwitz had been liberated two and a half months before Bergen-Belsen.
On a freezing January 27, 1945...
...a Ukrainian division of the Soviet army, accompanied by a film crew...
...arrived at the site of the most successful mass murder...
...in mankind's history.
The last SS guards had already fled...
...leaving behind only those too young or infirm...
...to be led away on the now-notorious death marches.
The gassings at Auschwitz had already stopped the previous November.
The gas chambers dynamited.
But in a wild attempt to cover their tracks...
...the SS dragged thousands away with them in desperate flight...
...in the biting cold.
Those of the prisoners who could not keep up...
...were shot at the side of the road by their German escort.
Tens of thousands perished
"somewhere in Europe" of hunger...
...thirst or exhaustion, or from an SS bullet.
Fritz Pfeffer had been amongst those taken away before the Russians came...
...to die on December 20, 1944...
...in Neuengamme concentration camp in Germany.
Anne's boyfriend from the days in the annex, Peter van Pels...
...was marched out of Auschwitz by the Germans on January 16...
...and taken to Mauthausen death camp in Austria...
...where he died on May 5, 1945...
...just three days before the Americans liberated that camp.
His mother, Auguste van Pels, was sent on a crazy journey...
...across Germany and Czechoslovakia.
First to Bergen-Belsen, then to Theresienstadt.
And in the last days of the Reich...
...to an unknown camp, where she too died.
One of the millions of anonymous bodies left...
...by Hitler's failed vision of a thousand-year empire.
Otto Frank, weighing less than 115 pounds...
...was amongst the lucky few that the Russians found alive in Auschwitz.
When he was recovered, Otto wrote to his mother in Switzerland...
...where she had lived since before the war.
His letters then remained forgotten...
...in the attic of her home in Basle for nearly 50 years...
...until they were discovered by his nephew in May 1994.
"Auschwitz, 23 February 1945.
Dearest Mother: Hopefully these lines will reach you...
...bringing you and all my loved ones the news...
...that I have been liberated by the Russians...
...that I am healthy and in good spirits...
...and that I am being well taken care of.
I do not know where Edith and the children are.
We have been separated since September 5, 1944.
I just hope to see them back in good health.
I'm longing to see you all again and hope that this will be possible soon.
All my love, greetings and kisses.
Your son, Otto. "
So it was that Otto Frank, the only survivor...
...of the eight who had been in hiding in Amsterdam...
...took the long journey back to his Dutch adopted homeland.
By May, with the war in Europe ended...
...his Russian liberators had sent him...
...to the Black Sea port of Odessa.
There, he was placed on a New Zealand merchant ship...
...bound for France.
"May 26, 1945.
The steamer Monowai.
Dearest Mother and all you loved ones:
Tomorrow we arrive in Marseilles, and this letter can hopefully be mailed.
I imagine I will be able to telegraph you...
...so that you will get the news of my return in good health.
All my hope is the children.
I cling to the conviction that they are alive...
...and that we will be together again.
Unfortunately, Edith did not survive.
She died on January 6, 1945...
...in the hospital, of starvation.
Her body could not withstand attack of influenza.
The closer we get to home, the more impatient we get...
...to hear news of our loved ones.
What happened in all these years!
We own nothing anymore.
We won't find a pin when we get back.
Bernd Elias
Otto Frank's nephew
The Germans stole everything.
No photograph, letter or document will remain there.
Financially, we had no worries during the last years.
I earned good money and saved.
Now all is gone.
But I don't worry about this.
We have gone through too much to worry about things like that.
Only the children.
The children are what count.
I hope to get news from you straightaway.
Maybe you already have news of the girls.
I cannot write about everything that I am thinking of.
I have to stay in Holland as...
...with the exception of a tattooed number on my arm...
...I have no papers and therefore must think of seeing you later.
The main thing is that we have contact.
We hope to see each other soon.
With innermost greetings and kisses and love, your Otto. "
My husband worked on the station...
Miep Gies
...registering all the people who are coming down from...
...the concentration camps.
And he ask everyone:
"Have you seen Mr. Frank?
Have you heard about Mr. Frank?"
And one day, one evening, he came home and he said:
"I have good news for you.
Otto Frank is coming home. "
And when he said this, we lived downstairs.
Mr. Frank came...
...along the window.
I ran to the door.
At first what I ask was:
"Where's Edith?"
Otto Frank said to me,
"Edith never come...
...but I have hope for the children. "
And he came to us.
Because he had no house, no nothing...
...he lived seven years in our house.
But the life go on.
We go every day...
...to the office.
But I do not give him the diary of Anne Frank.
You may not know this...
...but when he was on the ship...
...from Odessa to Marseilles...
...Otto wrote a letter to his mother.
In that letter he said this:
"Kugler and Kleiman, and especially Miep...
...her husband and Bep Voskuijl cared for us for two years...
...with everything we needed...
...in spite of the dangers...
...and unprecedented sacrifices they made.
One cannot describe it.
I will never be able to repay what all these people have done. "
I never know about this. No.
That is the first time...
...I heard it. Thank you.
While Miep kept the diary secret from
Otto in case Anne should return...
...he was desperate to find his daughters.
He advertised in newspapers and visited the Dutch Red Cross...
...asking, always asking for news of Anne and Margot.
At the end of July, he was told that someone knew of their fate.
In August, he had the tragic news confirmed.
He stood on the porch and rang the bell...
...and remained standing on the porch.
He said, "Are you Janny Brandes?"
And I said, "Yes. "
"Can I come in?"
Because he was a very polite gentleman.
He came into the hallway...
...and remained standing there and said:
"What happened to my daughters?
I am Otto. "
I could hardly speak...
...because it was very difficult...
...to tell someone...
...that his children were not alive anymore.
I said, "They are no more. "
He turned deathly pale...
...and slumped down into a chair.
I just put my arm around him.
When the girls' death had been confirmed...
...Miep gave up the secret she kept hidden from Otto...
...since the day of the family's capture more than a year before.
From her top drawer, she handed him...
...three books and a sheaf of loose papers:
Anne's diary, which she herself had never read.
I took the diary...
...out of my desk...
...and gave him it with the words:
"That is a testament for your daughter Anne. "
Can you look?
Can you see how this man looked at me?
Lost his wife.
Lost his two children.
He had the diary.
Otto transcribed sections of the diary for his mother in Switzerland.
He also started showing it to friends...
...seeking their views on what to do with his daughter's unique legacy.
They all advised him to have it published...
...but his efforts met with no success.
Then this article, written by a friend of a friend...
...appeared in an Amsterdam paper in April 1946...
...and finally, a publisher stepped forward.
Het Achterhuis, "The Back House, " appeared in June 1947.
Initially, it made little impact.
Then in the 1950s...
...German, French, English and other translations began to appear.
In 1955, a stage adaptation opened on
Broadway to a rapturous reception.
The transformation of the 15-year-old
German-Jewish refugee...
...into an emblem of the Holocaust gathered pace.
A 1959 feature film based on the play added further to this process.
To some, she had become little short of a saint.
But her diary, at the very least, had become a publishing phenomenon.
In 1953, Otto had remarried and moved to Switzerland.
In the absence of Anne, he became the focus for his daughter's celebrity.
He, in turn, came to symbolize the perfect father so many children crave.
Thousands wrote to him from around the world...
...and he replied to each individually.
If young people are writing to me after reading the diary...
Otto Frank interviewed in 1976
...I start to think:
"That is, for me, one of the most precious. "
Though Otto developed relationships, sometimes close ones...
...with many of the children who wrote to him...
...he admitted he never understood his own daughter in her lifetime.
Was she in fact the optimist and cheerful person that he saw as a child?
She showed herself like that.
But in fact, I only learned to know her really...
...through her diary.
Throughout these years, one persistent problem refused to go away:
Citing differences between different language versions of the diary...
...which were never explained in the various editions...
...together with further fictional scenes in the play and film...
...neo-Nazis around the world...
...wanting to throw doubt on the very existence of the Holocaust...
...alleged that the diary was a hoax.
Painful and inconclusive lawsuits followed...
...but it was only in 1980, after Otto's death...
...that the authenticity of the diary was finally tested scientifically.
The extensive report by the Netherlands
State Institute for War Documentation...
...took five years to complete and was eventually published...
...with a study of all the versions of Anne's diary.
It categorically stated that the diary was genuine in every respect.
In 1960, one of Holland's most secret places became one of its most public.
The Franks' annex was opened as a museum...
...and is now visited by over
600,000 tourists a year.
Otto also created charitable foundations...
...to perpetuate Anne's message to the world.
Anne was not simply to be commemorated...
...but her short life was to become a more general force for good.
To fight against prejudice and discrimination...
...and hatred against people of different race and religion.
Since 1985, a touring exhibition...
...telling Anne's life story and its relevance to current world affairs...
...has traveled from country to country, from Moscow to Minneapolis...
...South America to South Africa.
It has also shown that the diary has had some surprising readers...
...in surprising places.
During the many years my comrades and I spent in prison...
Nelson Mandela
President of South Africa
Political Prisoner 1964-1990
...we derived inspiration from the courage and tenacity...
...of those who challenge injustice...
...even under the most difficult circumstances.
Some of us read Anne Frank's diary on Robben Island...
...and derived much encouragement from it.
It's very interesting...
...the letters of the German children.
They always ask me everything...
...because they wrote me:
"My father or grandfather...
...didn't tell me anything about the war.
They say always, 'That is the past.
That is over. "'
But that is not true.
The past goes always with you...
...in your whole life, and we can learn from the past.
In 1941, there was a wedding at Merwedeplein in Amsterdam.
After filming the street...
...the cameraman pointed at the onlookers above.
There at the window was Anne Frank.
This is the only known moving footage of her.
When she stood at the window that sunny day in June...
...it's not surprising that the 12-year-old Anne Frank...
...was yet to find her life's purpose.
But less than three years later, as she sat caged...
...in the fragile security of her hiding place...
...she had discovered her destiny.
"Wednesday, April 5, 1944.
My dearest Kitty:
I don't want to have lived in vain like most people.
I want to be useful or bring enjoyment to people...
...even those I've never met.
I want to go on living, even after my death.
And that's why I'm grateful to God for having given me this gift...
...which I can use to develop and to express...
...all that's inside me.
Yours, Anne M. Frank. "

{12508}{12568}You didn't?
{12570}{12650}I burst the seat of my pants.
{18781}{18856}We never did get it right on stage|because we... It was retarded...
{18862}{18934}...and I wanted it quick.
{19216}{19315}I wanted the group to say "heart away".
{23917}{23984}Were we in tempo?

{30590}{30627}You've got to be kidding!
{30633}{30656}He had to quit.
{30662}{30780}See, what happened, Gigi was married|and had a baby, an infant...
{30786}{30840}...and he had a little boy back in Memphis.
{30846}{30908}So he had to leave the little boy|in Memphis, because...
{30914}{30973}...his wife's parents|were keeping the little boy...
{30979}{31042}...and they wouldn't let him|take him out of town.
{31048}{31112}So, they had one child in California,|and one back there.
{31118}{31191}They were traveling back and forth|and it was too much for him.
{31197}{31267}But if it was his child.|Can't he take his child with him?
{31273}{31325}It's not really his child, it was...
{31331}{31404}...his wife's child by a previous marriage.
{31410}{31511}- And she couldn't take him?|- She wouldn't take him away.
{31517}{31573}- It was just a family thing. He quit.|- Yeah.

{33037}{33159}{y:i}I'd like to point out a problem.|{y:i}When it switches, it sounds like...
{33162}{33240}{y:i}When it switches, it sounds like|{y:i}some of the guys are just lost...
{33246}{33368}{y:i}... which is the way it is,|{y:i}but we don't have to emphasize it.
{33438}{33518}- I made a mistake.|{y:i}- It's all right.
{33537}{33640}{y:i}I wanna try something.|{y:i}This is the last verse.
{36155}{36218}{y:i}We can do a yodel.
{40362}{40424}{y:i}Play that song.
{41582}{41652}{y:i}Sing it slow.

{43291}{43316}{y:i}They'll cut it out.
{43322}{43419}{y:i}They'll put an X rating|{y:i}right across your big mouth.
{43437}{43476}{y:i}"Mouth" I said.
{43482}{43578}{y:i}That shows how you think.|{y:i}I wouldn't say that.
{43593}{43658}{y:i}They'll cut that out. They won't leave it in.
{43664}{43756}{y:i}You can't say "big ass" in this family.
{43847}{43921}"Okay." Mary in the Morning.
{46347}{46408}{y:i}Sing it again.
{46664}{46738}{y:i}Just a chord.
{47166}{47274}You only got about another 45 minutes|of sitting around.
{47292}{47386}I know you've been great,|but listen to this.
{47512}{47584}That's the wildest laugh.
{47629}{47711}That's about how I feel.
{47941}{48024}No wonder he can't have a good time.|He's reading telegrams while we talk.
{48030}{48124}"Here's hoping you have a very successful|opening and that you break both legs."
{48130}{48186}- Goddamn!|- Tom Jones.
{48192}{48288}"My God, my God,|why hast thou forsaken me?"
{48330}{48405}Signed, "The Pope".
{48447}{48519}"Best wishes for a continuing|successful Vegas show."
{48525}{48636}"I hope you get a raise|in the next six months, Joyce Brazil."
{48706}{48785}Don't pick your nose on camera.
{48827}{48917}Don't pick your nose on camera, man.
{48950}{49039}It starts to get tense about this time.
{49116}{49179}I just hope I don't forget the words to...
{49185}{49296}..."I Just Can't Help Believin'".|I hope I don't forget the words.
{49420}{49489}Right there, that's the first verse.|You got the rest of it.
{49495}{49545}If I get through the first one, I get it.
{49551}{49624}Very proud. Nice to see you.|Hope you enjoy our show tonight.
{49630}{49686}- Have you seen Elvis before?|- I've seen him twice.
{49692}{49730}Good. We've a better show tonight.
{49736}{49829}Well, he was absolutely fantastic that time.
{49878}{49939}Nice to see you tonight.|Nice to have you with us.
{49945}{49997}Glad to have you aboard|to see Elvis tonight.
{50003}{50069}Well, of course.|He sings those Spanish songs like nobody.
{50075}{50089}Hello!
{50095}{50165}Mrs. Xavier Cugat.|How are you? Good to see you.
{50171}{50224}You came to see Elvis?
{50230}{50304}You should've seen me at dinner tonight.|I was going...
{50310}{50379}In tempo.
{50391}{50490}I never swallowed any of it.|It was all right here.
{50547}{50594}Hello, how are you?
{50600}{50690}I came to see that "pectoral destruction".
{50864}{50926}If the songs don't go well,|we can do a medley of...
{50932}{51002}We can pray.
{51059}{51111}- Has the show started yet?|- Yes.
{51117}{51213}- Who's on?|- Sammy says bring in the machine.
{51426}{51527}Straight vodka, man, it's good for you.
{52438}{52574}We could put the words of|"I Just Can't Help Believin'" on that stool.
{56503}{56552}{y:i}That's it, you know. I just...
{56558}{56630}{y:i}Tapers off to nothing.
{60090}{60161}{y:i}I knew a song about...
{60166}{60250}{y:i}I don't know, when I was a baby.
{60302}{60414}{y:i}You got to lean on your knee, like this.|{y:i}Like a fool.
{60602}{60698}{y:i}It's a very tender love song. It's a ballad.
{60704}{60794}{y:i}You get up into a girl's face,|{y:i}you know, very close...
{60800}{60826}{y:i}... and you say:
{60832}{60896}{y:i}"Yeah!"
{60922}{61004}{y:i}And it blows her hair straight back.
{62942}{62981}{y:i}You know, when I first started...
{62987}{63044}{y:i}... in this business...
{63050}{63091}{y:i}... I was a little, bitty guy...
{63097}{63169}{y:i}... with a shaky leg.
{63169}{63223}{y:i}So, Ed Sullivan saw me and said:
{63229}{63301}{y:i}"Son of a bitch."
{63427}{63491}{y:i}Anyway, they put me on TV|{y:i}and filmed me from the waist up.
{63497}{63571}{y:i}You know, I'm going...
{63626}{63720}{y:i}Anyway, MGM is doing a movie...
{63723}{63781}{y:i}... called...
{63787}{63875}...Elvis Loses his Excess.
{63908}{63982}{y:i}"Shakes his Excess Off", or whatever it is.
{63988}{64072}{y:i}So don't let these cameras throw you.
{64075}{64152}{y:i}Give me an E, or a G, or an F, or a D.
{64158}{64239}{y:i}Or a B-flat minor, plus one.
{64267}{64320}{y:i}I don't know what I'm talking about.
{64326}{64413}{y:i}If you milk this thing long enough...
{64494}{64579}{y:i}I'll put this in front of you, Ronnie.
{65786}{65846}{y:i}Play it, Jim.
{67384}{67458}{y:i}I made a movie about it.
{67598}{67693}{y:i}What are you laughing at?|{y:i}This is my first guitar. I was little.
{67699}{67736}{y:i}I told you.
{67742}{67807}{y:i}Little bitty cat,|{y:i}trying to get people to listen to me.
{67813}{67883}{y:i}Listen to me, I'm good.
{67978}{68029}{y:i}Not with that voice, you ain't.
{68035}{68095}{y:i}Anyway...
{68312}{68405}{y:i}Anyway, my first movie,|{y:i}ladies and gentlemen.
{68452}{68535}{y:i}That's really this guitar doing that.
{69401}{69466}{y:i}How you doing, sir?
{69480}{69525}{y:i}Thank you.
{69531}{69601}{y:i}Are you afraid of me?
{70539}{70626}{y:i}Hang loose, I'll be with you in a minute.
{70962}{71030}{y:i}I'll be over there.
{73878}{73964}{y:i}Sorry I couldn't make it up there.
{74534}{74611}{y:i}Take it home, baby!
{74801}{74826}{y:i}That's it.
{74832}{74905}{y:i}Thank you very much.
{75047}{75106}{y:i}Everybody ready?
{75112}{75164}{y:i}I'm not.
{75170}{75235}{y:i}I'm not.
{75271}{75334}{y:i}Okay.
{78550}{78584}{y:i}What you got there?
{78590}{78664}{y:i}What's that look for?
{78670}{78693}{y:i}Picture of me?
{78699}{78728}{y:i}That's very nice.
{78734}{78812}{y:i}Looks like Engelbert Humperdinck.
{78850}{78883}{y:i}Yeah, sure will.
{78889}{78932}{y:i}Time-out, folks. Just one second.
{78938}{79034}{y:i}Bahija. Is that your name?
{79143}{79193}{y:i}- You want me to have this one?|- Do you like it?
{79199}{79248}{y:i}Thank you very much. Yes, it's very nice.
{79254}{79331}{y:i}I can't do that. I'm sorry.
{79362}{79430}{y:i}Hang loose, you'll get it back.
{79436}{79498}{y:i}Okay.
{79498}{79542}{y:i}I just did a country and western album.
{79548}{79601}{y:i}In it is a song. It's called:
{79607}{79681}Just Pretend.
{84869}{84953}{y:i}Thank you. Thank you very much.
{84978}{85040}{y:i}Thank you.
{87278}{87344}{y:i}Play the song, James.
{92473}{92548}{y:i}One, two, three, four!
{103174}{103255}{y:i}What are you looking at back there?
{109751}{109814}{y:i}Thank you.
{110036}{110096}{y:i}Good evening.
{110140}{110196}{y:i}Just grab hold, honey, anywhere.
{110202}{110234}{y:i}There you go.
{110240}{110306}{y:i}Hi, little girl.
{110337}{110413}{y:i}Oh, what's the matter, baby?
{110508}{110573}Please, kiss me!

A meadow in early morning somewhere on earth.
Hidden here is the world as wast as our own where the weeds are like inpenetrable jungles, stones are mountains, and even the smallest pond becomes an ocean
Time passes differently here, an hour is like a day, a day is like a season, and the passing of a season is a lifetime.
But to observe this world...
...we must fall silent now...
...and listen to its murmurs.
[ Pigs squealing ]
MAN: As President Reagan was preparing to deliver his weekly radio address from Camp David, he ad-libbed thoughts on the economy during a microphone check, not intended to be part of his speech.
PRESIDENT REAGAN:
My fellow Americans,
I've talked to you about the economic problems and opportunities our nation faces.
I'm prepared to tell you it's a hell of mess.
The hard line being taken by the Reagan administration concerning the air controllers strike...
The Supreme Court delivered a potentially staggering setback to labor unions.
It comes at a time when union officials are charging there is a growing campaign to break unions.
MAN:
The operation will be nonunion.
Salaries will be cut in half.
MAN #2: Wilson Foods declared bankruptcy.
With the stroke of a pen, it could stay in business but void its labor contract and slash workers' salaries by 40% to 50%.
WOMAN: These are hard times for the meatpacking industry.
MAN: Union labor has taken almost 50% wage-and-benefit cuts to keep their jobs and their companies afloat.
At least I'm taking some money home instead of nothing.
WOMAN: In Waterloo, Iowa, a shutdown.
At Iowa Beef, a violent strike...
MAN: Striking meatpackers facing 40% pay cuts go packing bricks against a truck at a Wilson Foods plant.
RATHER: Crossed picket lines in spite of an automobile barricade as Hormel's flagship plant, open for a second week...
WOMAN: ...send in the guards was reached after city officials said the situation at Hormel was beyond their control.
This is not Austin anymore!
It's Hormel, Minnesota!
You guys are helping them!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Austin, Minnesota, is not just about Austin, Minnesota.
Austin is the cavalry.
The workers in this nation.
Workers somewhere, sometime, someplace, must stand up and say,
"Enough is enough!"
We want jobs and justice.
Someday.
Can I give you a pamphlet here?
So you can see what's going on in the Austin plant. Thank you.
Can I give you one of these about the Hormel injury rate?
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.
Aren't you Mr. Anderson?
Hi. I don't know if you remember me.
- We had the good years.
- You did.
And this, I sure hope it comes, gets straightened out.
I'd like to see something settled.
And I understand your side of it.
I really do. I wouldn't like to take a cut either.
I wish everybody good luck.
I hope they don't have trouble with the company.
I'm retired, and if I were still working, if I lost my job, that would be terrible.
MAN:
Could I talk to your husband?
WOMAN: No, but there's something
I would love to say to you.
Aren't you guys happy working at the Hormel plant?
Under the current conditions, no.
We were happy making $10.69 and when Hormel treated us decent.
Why do you stay at a place you're not happy?
We don't have all the money in the world like the Knowltons.
There are so many people that would love to have your job at $8.75 an hour and all those nice benefits.
When we were your age, we weren't making what you were.
Then give us a fair shake like you got a fair shake.
[ Door closes ]
Hmm.
If we gotta give up 23% wages and 30% cut in benefits, when the company's making $30 million, what are we gonna have to give when they show a loss?
Two years ago under the incentive program, my last incentive check in the hog cut in the new plant,
I grossed $637 for 47 hours' work.
After the incentive program was taken away,
I went down to $409 a week.
Today I'm making $312.
Working twice as hard for the same amount of hours.
It's ridiculous.
My father worked for George A. Hormel plant for many years.
He was also a very proud man.
He was a hard worker.
He was proud of his products.
He was in the days of heavy production.
He went out on a stretcher one day from the plant.
My husband now, I'm proud to be a wife of a hog cutter.
I'm proud of the products.
But I don't like the way they're treating my family or my husband or anyone else who ever worked for that plant.
[ Cheers and applause ]
JIM: It's a real quagmire of a situation, and people are really getting hurt.
Their pride is hurt because they can't fulfill the needs of their family, and they've somehow got to go on welfare programs, and people are very angry, hurt, upset, frustrated.
And it's difficult to vent your frustrations in the proper direction.
WOMAN:
Utility workers make more.
Meter readers make more.
The garbage collectors make more.
A guy that works with Wes, or did work with my husband quit.
He got hired at the city.
He's starting at $11-something an hour.
But I don't begrudge anybody that's making $30,000,
But let us live in our house.
Let us live in our $32,000 house.
And that we all may walk in faith
In your community
NYBERG:
In Austin, 22,000 people.
We're in a little world by ourselves down here.
These are the people we go to church with.
These are the people we go to grocery stores with.
We meet on the street.
We meet in various forms of recreation.
We rub shoulders with them.
Do we care about our employees?
Yes, we do.
But in the long term, we don't want to go the way of many other packers who realized too late that their costs were out of line and then tried to recover and couldn't.
FILM NARRATOR:
It's been written that Jay
was a born innovator
and remembered for his social conscience.
His thoughtful understanding of
and concern for the welfare of the working man
was surely what gave rise to the benefits
that have been made available to Hormel personnel.
He initiated the first guaranteed annual wage.
There was also a first-of-its-kind
profit-sharing plan for the workers
that paid a share of the profits to each of them.
Perhaps that explains why everyone at Hormel
strives for quality and efficiency.
WOMAN: I've worked for Hormel, it'll be 43 years this year.
And if it were necessary as a survival,
I would be all for it.
We've done it before over the many, many times.
But this, I think, is just the mood of the industry, and they're jumping on the bandwagon to be one of them to say,
"We were able to do it, too."
Where, I think, if they would have left our wages at their present standard, people would have really used them as a shining example that in hard times, if you really have good productivity, good relationship with your employees, that you're able to handle the bad times.
I hope that they have enough of the vision that I think I must have for the welfare of the long-term future of the company, that would say,
"We can do no more."
If Jay Hormel were here today, if George A. Hormel were here, they probably would be doing exactly the same thing that we are.
I think unions are getting their teeth kicked in.
I think if you're into a situation of where you're getting beat up, you better try something different.
MAN: Corporate campaigns initiated by Ray Rogers...
MAN #2: Rogers has been used to targeting one enemy, the employer.
MAN #3: Rogers brought his Corporate Campaign here...
JIM: We were very ineffective in communicating our message.
MAN #4:
He managed to attract reporters from the "New York Times," the "Chicago Tribune"...
JIM: I ran across an article on
Ray Rogers and gave him a call.
MAN #5: Tough-talking labor consultant...
JIM: He said he needed to do a little research because he was a vegetarian, didn't know anything about meatpacking.
Ray came and made a presentation to our membership.
RAY: We will run a multimillion dollar campaign even though you don't have millions of dollars.
The greatest resource, the greatest strength you have is the people themselves.
And that's why we feel so confident that we can pull off a major victory, not just for Local P-9 in Austin, but for labor throughout this entire country.
- Congratulations, partner.
- Yeah.
The price of poker just went up.
In this game, because that's the way the company views it.
It's a game the way they want to treat people, hold their whole lives in jeopardy.
And to them, it might be a game.
And to us, it's a war.
Things can really start moving now.
Super.
That's just really nice.
And we hope that the corporate executives from Hormel come.
We hope the executives from the bank come.
We want everybody to see the type of program that we plan on running and then let them begin to lose the night's sleep like they've caused this community to lose sleep.
[ Chanting ]
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
RAY: On our staff, we have experts in all facets of research and analysis, communications experts, and experts in all facets of political and community organization.
We looked out there in society and saw poor and working people getting the daylights kicked out of them.
We felt there had to be a mechanism that they and unions and community groups could turn to that had a lot of expertise in how to challenge powerful adversaries that were irresponsible in the policies directed at workers.
So we developed
Corporate Campaign programs.
And our campaign is one of taking the offense, showing that workers can fight back.
That they don't have to keep taking one loss after another.
You know what we need to do.
JIM: Ray told me you're never going to outspend a company, public-relations-wise.
My name is Ray Rogers.
I'm with Corporate Campaign.
JIM:
That what you needed to do was look at creating a situation that became a newsworthy situation.
The company spent millions in many years to build an image.
That's being destroyed overnight.
JIM: The strategy was to go after the money behind the corporation.
There's a lot of labor money in First Bank's system.
MAN: Ray Rogers and his Corporate Campaign mailed this letter to over 5,000 union members in the Midwest that says in part the First Bank system is a principal stockholder in the Hormel company and thus can influence policy.
This institution is directly involved in the policymaking process of Hormel.
JIM: Ray knows how to put labor's best foot forward so that John Q. Public would sympathize with our cause.
There's some guy I'd never seen.
They started talking to me about that Hormel situation.
The guy says, "Are you the guy that's been brought in?
Man, I'm telling you, you can't imagine how many of my friends are watching this.
We're 100% behind you.
You're teaching this country something.
And, by God, you gotta win."
This is what I'm getting everywhere.
You are a symbol of something that goes beyond Austin.
Don't you forget it.
Local P-9 engaged the services of a labor consultant from New York City.
Mr. Ray Rogers and Corporate Campaign.
And Mr. Rogers has a different philosophy about how to deal with companies.
Traditional collective bargaining is not the preferred method that he would use.
His traditional approaches are harassment, intimidation, and threats.
And his rationale for that mode of approaching an employer is that if you can embarrass a company hard enough and long enough, you'll bring that company to its knees.
And they will agree to the terms and conditions of his client unions, the ones that he represents.
So he came to us with that approach.
There's supposed to be some other pigs here today.
CROWD: We don't need
First Bank's greed!
If anybody doesn't have a sign, just grab a sign here.
CROWD: We don't need
First Bank's greed!
From day to day, you get to be on a high like today with everybody here.
But when you go home and nobody's around you, you tend to get down.
But then you get back up when you go back to the union hall and start helping.
Then you get up again.
We're on the right side of things.
People are realizing we're willing to fight that fight.
People recognize that the labor movement being a key factor if we're gonna have any real meaningful social -- economic -- Cut.
NARRATOR: Are you afraid of Corporate Campaign?
We're not.
What happens if they persist?
Well, I don't know.
With our position,
I don't know what they can do.
I realize that they can say a lot of things, but they can't do a lot of things.
And I think it's tragic, because the only thing they end up doing is destroying their jobs and their company.
MAN: Thank you all very much.
Appreciate it.
NARRATOR: The United Food and Commercial Workers
is the parent union of Austin's local union P-9.
The Local 9 will suffer as a result of it.
They can't negotiate by themselves.
Lewie Anderson is the director of the meatpacking division.
And they say, "This company is a profitable company, and nothing else in the universe matters.
We have a right to our $10.69.
We have a right to those benefits."
That's their thinking.
To go even beyond that there, they are convinced by Ray Rogers that the Corporate Campaign will achieve that goal for them.
He shot them a line of shit, is all he did.
The plain fact of the matter is there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever they are not going to win through a corporate campaign.
They are not gonna win.
If they continue, they're gonna become bigger losers than what they are now.
It is gonna cost them their jobs.
Instead of making $8.25 an hour, or $9.25 an hour...
MAN ON RADIO:
Good one by Glen Campbell.
It's time for the song of inspiration brought to you by your friends at Omaha Auto and Truck
Recyclers Association.
It used to be you always had problems.
You always had one or two local unions that were going through real serious problems, but you had some time to think about it and to work with them and stay with them and help them work through those problems.
But what you've had in the last five years is everybody's had problems.
They've had them all at the same time.
You're just running all over the country in all directions, trying to patch things up and get things going in the right direction.
Then you don't get to stay.
You have to go deal with another crisis.
The companies in this industry are embarked on a program to tear the wages up, to tear the fringe benefits up, to return us to the days of "The Jungle" 60 years ago.
Do the unions have any clout?
Does the public care about the unions anymore?
Can the unions sell this message?
CROWD:
Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Local unions like P-9
have complete autonomy to carry on all union business
as long as they don't violate
their international constitution.
The International Union can only give strategic advice.
MAN: What can you do that we can't do?
- So far, I haven't seen much.
- Really?
- [ Crowd groans ]
- There's your answer.
No, I want you to answer that.
I want you to answer that.
You're reading too many things about what Lewie Anderson and other people are saying.
- You're dodging the question.
- I'm not dodging the question.
That's a question that was asked.
I'm not gonna answer it.
What you do not have, what the International has not furnished, what you have not furnished is the analysis upon which you build a program of real, impenetrable economic and political pressure, harassing the company.
We have developed some damn good campaign literature.
I haven't seen anybody from the International come and give you that kind of direction or campaign literature.
One thing I'll credit you.
You're a hell of a motivator.
Millions of dollars worth of free and positive publicity for your campaign, national press coverage.
Yes, you have!
And that's your answer.
All right.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you with P-9?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Is what Local 9 proposing up there with the Corporate Campaign the answer to the problems we have seen in the meatpacking industry in the past and the challenges that we're faced for the future?
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, too.
Are you saying that regardless of what is decided by this organization, you're going to go ahead with that campaign as you've outlined it?
If the rank and file dictates they're gonna resist pay cuts, we're gonna resist the pay cuts.
And I guess we would like to see you on our side in this fight.
The Austin program, it occurs to us, is symptomatic of Reagan's philosophy.
"I'll get mine, and the hell with everybody else."
RAY: Maybe we shouldn't expect every meatpacker to receive the same wage.
Maybe we need to look at each company and say,
"What is the profitability of the company?"
Then base the wages that we expect on its profitability.
God damn it, the guy working at Armour, $6 bucks an hour, doing the same work they're doing in Austin deserves the $10.69, too, as well as every other packinghouse worker!
That is what we stand for.
That is what we gotta do.
We cannot have one group hanging way up here and everybody else down below.
It's the wrong kind of unionism.
We're here saying, you know, we've got a program.
We're representing a client and a large group of people.
We're gonna continue to represent them as long as they want us to.
MAN: Why won't the International support the Hormel workers?
Is $10.69 an hour too much?
Look, I worked in those packinghouses.
I worked for a very antiunion employer as a beef skinner, so I know what that work is.
And they deserve $10.69-plus, believe me.
One of the things that Local 9 has said to the Packing Committee is, "Well, if we can get $10.69 there, that's the shining star, and everybody will go to that."
But I gotta tell you, in some 10 or 15 years of our experience, that's not the case.
One of two things happens.
Those operators on the low end of the scale get bigger, or those on the high end of that wage scale say, "The hell with it," and they go out of business, or they close this plant and go down the road and open up a plant at $5.00 or $6.00 an hour.
That would be great if we could do that.
I'd be the first to say,
"Let's do it."
But it don't work that way.
We came into this thing alone, and we'll go out alone.
I want to tell you,
I am disgusted to be even associated with this organization.
You've got to.
John, take your pen if you're disgusted.
Yeah. You've got a lot of gutless people here.
JIM: We pleaded with the National Union that if they couldn't support us, get out of the way.
If you're gonna get in the way and run interference for Hormel, then we're gonna go right through you if we have to.
So you've got the International
Union looking at it and saying,
"If these people are successful, they may find that an International Union isn't necessary, and all they need is a labor consultant from time to time.
LEWIE:
Now we have a situation where some of the people from Local 9 and Ray Rogers have a caravan roaming across the country, spieling out some of the most antiunion venom.
JIM: Our caravan was designed to tell people what was going on from workers just like themselves.
We had the facts.
We had the information to back it up.
We were gonna tell it to them, give it to them, read it to them, sing it, whatever it took.
RAY:
$100,000 expense account, and Lewie Anderson was making his $70,000-plus salary and his lavish expense account.
If you think when the public sees that that they understand the complexities of what's going on in Austin, Minnesota.
All they see is 200 or 300 people screaming how the union is no good.
We're not like some other locals.
Our membership told us they didn't want that agreement by a 76% vote.
Get the Hormel chain settlement.
Do you think the vice-president of an international union ought tell you you ought to take a concession with by far the most profitable company in an industry?
LEWIE: Antiunionism is oozing out of our own ranks.
That'll destroy us quicker than anything will.
I know this is definitely a union-made tent.
JIM: People who believe in what they're doing are the most dangerous kind of folks in the world.
The union there.
52 in Monroe and this one.
We'll go hit the banks, and then we'll go on to Ottumwa.
MAN: I want to thank all you guys from P-9 because you have performed a miracle for the Hormel employees of Ottumwa.
I can look out in this crowd and see at least
40 guys and girls that down at work for the past seven years have looked like they were dead.
And you have resurrected them to life.
Hey, listen, thanks a lot.
Good talking to you.
JIM: We're creating a situation where the membership is starting to dictate to the leadership,
"Support these guys because we believe in what they're doing."
If making less money is so good, but people don't want to do it, why should they have to do it?
[ Horn honking ]
WOMAN:
Hormel hot dogs
We don't like Hormel and their hot dogs
P-9 thanks you.
We'll be back!
Yeah!
LEWIE: They have a machine in place to make you look like you don't know what you're talking about or carrying the company message.
Rogers and Guyette, with their machine, have a firm grip on that situation.
If you want to gain your union back, you're gonna have to recognize what you're up against.
This meeting is somewhat clandestine in that if you're going to put together a committee, then you need time to get it off the ground without them branding you at this moment that the International is behind it.
It started with four of us that met two weeks ago with Lewie.
It started off with that group.
We expanded to 16.
Now we're going to go in a meeting here.
All of us are gonna try to sing off the same sheet of music.
Hopefully, you'll be able to go back to Austin.
Once we get the ball rolling, we'll all be provided with information.
RAY:
So when anybody is attacking what this campaign is doing, attacking anybody working in this group and has done anything for this campaign, they're attacking every one of us.
WOMAN: What are we doing that's so antiunion?
I see more union people here and more support than I do anywhere.
That's not antiunion.
That's going forward.
I want to be a union of the '80s.
I want to welcome all our guests, visitors, friends, and everyone that is here today.
We have representatives from the Hormel locals in Fremont, Beloit, Ottumwa.
We've got our friends from
Farmstead Foods and Albert Lea, steelworkers from the Iron Range, representatives from the Teamsters.
Through good organization, good communications, we're able to wage a campaign that even the biggest unions in the country have not been able to wage.
Are you willing to stand up and fight?
CROWD:
Yeah!
Let's stand up!
Give me a "W"!
- "Give me an "I"!
- "I"!
- Give me an "N"!
- "N"!
- What do you got?
- Win!
We're gonna win it!
- Yeah!
- We're gonna win it!
MAN:
To some, he is a prophet.
A messiah who has assembled the tools that can bring corporate giants to their knees.
MAN: This man is a organizational genius.
There's no getting around that.
He's got all the bases covered.
People are playing pool, they're getting together.
There's a lot of things that are going on in that union hall that should have gone on years ago.
He's kept the hands and minds busy of the people.
MAN: Lewie Anderson is the Austin union's international vice-president in Washington.
Our research has shown that Hormel could do more damage to First Bank by taking their money out than what First Bank could ever do to Hormel.
Well, Lewie's lying.
Okay, I want to say this very clear.
Lewie is lying.
I believe he looked at Hormel's history.
He talked to some people, and he thought once he put a public campaign with the news media, they were gonna crumble.
The strategy or the research,
I should say, had about as much depth as piss on a flat rock.
How much more damage has to be done before you figure out that that strategy is not working?
Bull!
I don't take anything away from Local 9 in terms of rallying people.
They've done a good job with it.
But it's a doomed strategy.
It was doomed from the beginning, and we tried to impress that on them.
Being militant and standing up if you're on the wrong strategy doesn't make it right.
People still end up getting hurt.
Rates still continue to tumble.
You don't have the luxury of saying,
"At least we're fighting."
Because when you fight and it's over and you've lost everything, that's a terrible price to pay just to say that you were tough.
What we're doing makes sense, and we believe in it.
Belief is something that will carry you a long ways.
NARRATOR:
Hormel's proposal
keeps a base wage frozen for three years
at $10 per hour.
And any new employees would be paid $2 less for the same work.
Hormel's final offer is rejected
by both the local union and the International.
NYBERG:
If we're faced with a situation where there is a withholding of labor on one side, we could shut the plant down completely.
We could try to run the plant with management employees on a reduced basis.
We could hire temporary replacements for strikers who elect to stay out.
We could hire permanent replacements for strikers who elect to stay out.
Any combination of those things.
We'll send the letter tonight, then. Right, Case?
When we hand-deliver the letter, we're gonna be on strike, as of midnight on Friday.
MAN:
We'll tell them that.
You want to get that set up in the main hall?
RAY:
You get your story here and make sure everybody hears about it. Really.
Just go ahead.
Aw, come on.
Aw, this is your show.
[ Cheering ]
JIM: The Hormel company put us into a corner, and we were gonna come after them, like a fighter going into a fight.
When you know you've trained about as well as you can, it's time to get the gloves on or take them off and do what you got to do.
By over a 93% margin, the contract proposal termed by the company to be their last and final offer was rejected.
So the Executive Board has met, and we intend to give the company a 48-hour-working-day notice tonight before midnight.
[ Cheers and applause ]
For the first time in 52 years,
Hormel's Austin plant was about to be shut down by a strike.
You're looking pretty chipper today.
- Hi, Bill.
- Hiya, Jim.
Too bad we can't meet under better circumstances.
I need you to sign.
In fact, if you want to sign a couple of them, you can.
We got new pencils for everyone, just like the President.
No, we don't.
That's mine.
- Okay, there you go, Jim.
- Okay. Thanks.
What may result from the Hormel workers' action is a test of just how much muscle organized labor can or cannot flex.
Kevin Berger, Channel 5
Eyewitness News, St. Paul.
NYBERG:
I think it is tragic.
We were hoping that some resolve would be reached, so that this community and certainly our employees wouldn't have to go through what we're facing.
We've done everything humanly possible to resolve this thing on reasonable terms.
But we aren't going to resolve this dispute on unreasonable terms.
JIM: The company's strategy is a clear one.
They want to freeze us out.
They want to starve us out.
And I think the motto that we at
Local 9 have is best exemplified in one of Bruce Springsteen's latest songs.
"We made a promise.
We swore we'd always remember.
No retreat and no surrender."
And I think that the fact that these people are here today helping us so that the company can't starve us out is certainly a giant push well on the way to let this company know that we are not about to surrender.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
What we started is something that's gonna be more than maybe what we thought.
I see people working together, people willing to share, people borrowing clothes.
I see people opening up.
I see people crying.
It's just a whole new part of people, and we're pulling together.
You know, we're a big family.
Just so it doesn't.
If it takes too long, people are gonna get short on cash.
Then they're gonna feel the squeeze really bad.
My kid five weeks ago got his finger in the door at home.
Just one of those freak accidents.
Went in and had three stitches.
120 bucks.
There went half of my paycheck.
This money is to be used for food for the people of Local P-9.
I can't even add.
I can't even add.
One thousand...
One hundred...
Forty-nine dollars!
Almost $1,050.
And they're not done yet.
Take it in brotherhood.
Spirit.
JIM: This money will be very much needed by our membership.
And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Hey, Joe. They lost their power over there.
JIM: Our union hall became a fun place to be at.
There was a lot of things going on.
It became a place where families could come.
We had a lot of folks who liked to work on cars.
Instead of pulling picket duty, they fixed our cars.
We had carpenters who fixed people's homes.
They did what they liked to do.
They did their hobbies.
I asked Guyette,
"Tell me where
Corporate Campaign is today, where it's going next week and the following weeks and relate that to how we're getting back into the packinghouse."
All they did is the same old gibberish.
"We've got a group.
We're gaining support.
We got money coming in."
They start with this gibberish, and you say,
"l didn't ask you that."
"Let him speak!"
Then Rogers gets into his filibuster.
Then all of a sudden, it's, "boom." "Next question."
"I was in Ottumwa, and the guys there were patting me on the back."
This guy gets it, and he talks for 10 or 15 minutes.
LEWIE: When he gets up to start his filibuster, you got to have
7, 8, 9, 10 people say,
"Tell me how you're gonna get the jobs back.
Tell me how you're gonna get a contract."
You got to keep pounding into him,
"Where are you as far as settling this thing?"
You got some maniacs up there in the leadership position and a maniac in Rogers, who has yet to do one positive thing. who has yet to do one positive thing.
We can't be jacking around here forever.
This is a mess.
That's what I'm saying.
Employees shall receive as normal 40 hours' pay.
Vacation pay shall consist of an employee's normal 40-hour weekly check.
- Yeah. That's good enough.
- Good.
JIM: Normally, the National
Union managed negotiations.
However, in this particular situation, our national union was spearheading a concessionary drive, and we didn't want a concessionary contract.
Therefore, our national union was told, "Get out of the way.
We'll deal with our own negotiations."
It don't mean anything.
NYBERG:
When the union made a proposal that we thought was outrageous, what we had to do is come back with a proposal of our own.
Instead of just basing it blindly on the old contract, we looked at every provision of that agreement and said,
"What would make sense here?"
WOMAN:
Who's gonna pay for that?
MAN:
The company.
What is it?
Joint Management Labor.
LEWIE: Any seasoned, experienced negotiator knows you don't rewrite your whole contract.
You don't throw your whole contract up for grabs.
You don't give the company the opportunity to dismantle your contract because you rewrote it.
But that's exactly what the P-9 leadership did.
They rewrote a whole contract.
Language it has taken
40 years to negotiate, language that provides the local union to have a say in how the goddamn plant is run.
When management got done with that contract, those things didn't exist.
And I'm speaking to 40 years of bargaining gone as a result of these assholes rewriting that whole contract and submitting it to the company.
Being a negotiator requires a lot of different skills, especially in an industry that's in turmoil, like this one.
Nobody likes to have their wages and benefits rolled back.
And it's unconscionable to put out this proposal after all the concessions these workers made.
What's your reaction?
- What's next?
- No further comments on that.
LEWIE: All I can do is take a peek at their vaults and see if there's any money.
If there is, we all run in there, we grab as much of it as we can, and we get the hell out.
Negotiations have broke off.
There are no further meetings scheduled.
LEWIE: That's pure, unadulterated bullshit!
What's holding up a contract settlement is that these bastards won't give you a decent wage!
That's what holding up the settlement!
Send your bargaining committee to Chicago with a vote of confidence that supports them and tells the company to stick their proposal where the sun don't shine and give us a decent contract!
Thank you very much.
JIM: Sometimes you have to fire the people up to send a clear message to management that the workers are really ticked off.
That they not only want what's right, they want more than what's right.
You better be prepared to give a lot back that was taken away!
Or you four can start looking for another job!
You want to come back to these meetings?
I worked out in that plant, and I busted my ass for you for over 18 years on production.
All of a sudden, you put the hammer down, and we go from our $10.69 down to $6.50 to walk back in that plant on a Monday.
You want to come back?
You keep your mouth shut, okay?
You don't know what you're talking about!
I won't take it anymore!
I won't have the courtesy of letting you ask questions.
I'll walk out the next time you open your mouth.
LEWIE: The more that the membership seems unreasonable, the more the bargaining committee seems unreasonable, the tougher they are...
Hello.
LEWIE: The more the employer has to rely on you as the negotiator, because you're the one, supposedly, that has to make common sense prevail.
I'd like to carve out numbers one and two and continue to talk with you to see if there's something we can do, but I haven't come up with anything.
LEWIE: You only do that once you have extracted the maximum from that employer.
And then you let the membership decide.
[ Crowd booing ]
They stole my check!
LEWIE: That's a danger when you fire the troops up, is that you get their expectations so high and they believe those expectations can be met.
If you don't meet them, they believe you haven't done your job and may believe you sold them out.
We can't afford to go backwards anymore.
We've went back far enough.
We work too goddamn hard down there to have to go backwards anymore.
I say, "Fuck them."
If they want to close it down, let them close it.
We can all find something else.
We're decent human beings, and we deserve every damn thing we get.
LEWIE:
If you take workers who feel that they're been mistreated or misused, they want to get at the heart of the matter.
They want to get to that employer.
It's their obligation to give it to us.
If they don't want to, then piss on them. Let them go.
Look, between both of you, you want a strike.
You keep snapping at everything for one.
- lf you want one.
- MAN: Some results, Lewie.
You think it's us?
I can't deliver, and I don't intend to carry this on.
I can't deliver something that's not there at this time.
I've been banging around.
Quit looking for somebody to run in with a fucking white horse!
You don't even know what negotiations is all about, and you act like you know everything!
I did not come here and act like I know everything, Lewie!
Our members are asking for some answers, Lewie!
Give your members some answers!
Don't lay the shit on me!
The easiest goddamn thing to do is blame somebody for the problem you're in!
We didn't blame you for the problem we're in.
LEWIE: The biggest and most powerful threat that you have is the threat of a strike.
When you actually have to use the strike, then you are going into an all-out war.
And you have to pick your fights.
If I get emotional.
I seem tired about this.
This is not jerk-off time.
This is serious business.
You better be able to inflict some economic damage on that employer.
If you cannot get into his pockets and take a lot of money out and make the employer understand that it's better to settle than it is to fight, then the employer will crush you.
Hormel's production has not been stopped.
The company shifted production to their other plants
that are still in operation.
In Austin, they are using their own management personnel
to turn out thousands of cans of Spam a day.
MAN: It's got to be blatantly obvious to everyone that this company doesn't want a contract.
MAN #2:
We're at the crossroads.
JIM:
I want to win.
MAN: I don't think there's a guy who don't want to win.
That's no excuse for doing something you shouldn't.
All I'm saying is, whatever it takes to win,
I want to do it.
LEWIE: That, potentially, is a time bomb that can blow up in all of our faces.
The company is gonna end up forcing a settlement on those people out there.
That is gonna be way under the Hormel chain settlement and under the Oscar Mayer settlement.
Here you're gonna have this big company, very profitable, that has got a substandard agreement that's gonna tear the shit out of our rates in the industry.
We are gonna negotiate shit if they get stuck with a bad settlement up there.
MAN:
You people are believing that we've got the power to get them to the table.
It is my assessment that the reason that we have been unsuccessful, the reason that our strategy hasn't worked, the reason that we've gone to a 4-1/2-month strike, is simply that very issue.
We don't have the strength to get them there.
The division that some have tried to create here has been to our downfall.
And I just wish that we could act concerted.
The fact is, I think we all realize right now the company is in a very solid and very legal position to start that packinghouse up without us if we don't go back to work.
Now, I think that the rank and file here has been misled in understanding this company's position.
The problem is, Jim, the company isn't gonna talk to you, period.
They've got a grudge against you.
You probably got a grudge against them.
And I don't care if we offer to go back for 5 bucks an hour.
The company ain't gonna talk to you.
Why don't you talk to them?
Because I'm not part of the negotiating board. That's why.
WOMAN:
You're out of order!
Hey, you can rule me out of order all you want.
I'm gonna tell you one thing.
Rule me out of order all you want.
JIM:
Security?
Did you call 911?
Get them in here.
Get them in here.
MAN:
Will you sit down?
What the hell is the matter with you?
Back off, you guys!
I relent!
If you have come to fight and not get any damn answers, continue!
Otherwise, sit down!
It's a union meeting!
We have said until we're blue in the face.
I don't know how we say it again.
We have gone as far as we're going to go.
If you want to go into negotiations and that means you're going to get more and more, no.
We're not going to give any more.
10 bucks.
They don't even want to talk about it anymore?
- Nope.
- Other than asking questions.
Yep.
There's no bargaining whatsoever?
You think you're winning.
I don't think you're winning.
The company, I don't think, thinks you're winning.
You're at war, they're at war, and they're not giving in.
The contract that you work under is your decision alone.
The Executive Board has recommended rejection.
I have a family like you have.
And I want to be able to say to them, as Hubert Humphrey said,
"I'd rather live 50 years like a tiger than 100 years like a chicken. "
NYBERG: We've got a $100 million plant that needs to be run.
We're taking applications tomorrow from people that want to work in that plant.
And if Local P-9 says,
"We are going to continue to withhold our labor," now the process is underway.
The union will have rights to their jobs until they've been permanently replaced.
No bills today.
When you got a place like this, we got 4-3/4 acres and house and lived here seven years.
And payments are, you know, a couple hundred dollars a month.
I got a wife and three kids, and I love them.
They'll understand later.
If it comes down to losing this place, we'll survive, just like a lot of people.
I got to give R.J. credit.
At least he made a stand, you know.
He put himself on one side or the other.
I'm on the side that's commonly referred to as the P-10ers.
That was my choice.
R.J. decided he wanted to follow
Ray Rogers and Jim Guyette.
It's a hard decision to make for some people, but it wasn't for me when we took that strike vote.
Go out there and be willing to give up things and make things better for us workers and workers around the
United States, union people.
We're tired of going backwards.
But then you have to look at the rest of the economy.
Throughout the nation, that's what's happening.
And I guess maybe you have to swallow hard, but if you want a job...
You're gonna have to take it,
I guess, a little bit.
NARRATOR: So, are you having problems with your brother?
Oh, I won't have any problems, really, until he crosses that line, to scab.
There's nothing worse than a scab, so how can you have anything to do with a scab?
You guys have been giving in and giving in for 23 years.
And we got unions all over the country watching us, counting on us.
People are counting on us.
RON:
To hell with them.
You know, we got
1,400 workers here.
We got thousands of people counting on us
And sending in money, you know.
But it's our job.
It's not theirs.
We knew this strike was coming.
We should've avoided it.
They didn't want to talk.
The International said,
"It's ill-advised.
You're on a suicide mission."
They told us that.
MAN: So far, I think
I've seen about five.
Let's see one, two...
Three, four...
Five, six...
I think I've seen seven.
I had to come today.
I had to know what it'd be like to see people coming into the place that
I spent my whole life in, going in and doing my job.
It's really, really hard to watch this happen.
I'm never gonna let myself get in a position like this again, where a group of a minority of assholes dictate how I handle the rest of my life.
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.
I'll tell you there will be no blocking of the ingress and egress of that plant.
That plant will operate.
The state police will come down on them and crush them.
You can't win that fight there.
If the police can't do it, then they'll bring the National Guard in.
That will demoralize the piss out of them.
They'll be standing there,
3 people every 50 feet with their dick in their hands, watching people take their jobs.
Now, that is very demoralizing.
[ Laughter ]
All right!
Look, you got to do it and be effective.
MAN:
I'd like to know how many people think they could get up at 3:30, 4:00, whenever the traffic comes in, and do it.
I'm ready right now.
All right, then let's do it
Friday morning!
Let's do it!
Then we'll see you at 4:00 in the morning!
[ Cheers and applause ]
[ Car horns honking ]
MAN ON RADIO: We might mention, if you are driving in the area, you will be diverted away from the plant, westbound.
If you're moving up the east side of the Hormel plant, you will be asked to turn your car around and go back.
MAN #2: We just heard from the
Austin Law Enforcement Center that all the roads surrounding the Hormel company itself have been blocked off.
MAN #3: We'll get further reports, Dan-o. Thank you.
One thing we should probably tell everybody.
If the police ask who's in charge, nobody's in charge.
Nobody's in charge.
No one's in charge!
It's cold out today.
God!
There's gonna be a lot of cars that's gonna freeze up.
If anybody comes, the police come and ask who's in charge, there's no one in charge!
There just happens to be a breakdown and a traffic jam.
So there's nobody in charge here!
MAN: If there's any interference with our police duties, we do not want to make arrests.
WOMAN: I lost eight hours' pay today because of that.
[ Crowd groaning ]
And while that might not seem like a lot to the P-9 members who have been on strike for 5 months, it wasn't a thing
I chose to do without.
I have every right to go in and do my job, just as they have every right to picket.
Mr. Mayor, this isn't a hostage situation.
This isn't Tehran, Iran.
This is Austin, Minnesota.
They told us that they would not let us in.
That is a lockout!
Don't be mad at us.
Blame it on the people causing the problem.
That's across the tracks.
It's them that put you in this position, because they put us in this position.
We don't know who's going in there to do what, so to stop it, we had to stop everybody that goes in that plant.
We had to close it down.
I don't want to merit right or wrong.
I'm not gonna pick sides.
But I got a question.
Is what the company's doing...
I don't want to discuss moralities.
Is what the company doing legal?
They're not out there because they like to holler and fight and they want to kill somebody.
They're out
'cause they want a contract where they can go to work.
We want to work.
This is a tragedy for all of us.
I was born and raised here.
Members of my family that are buried here.
These people are my friends on all sides of this issue.
I've graduated from high school with them.
I went to college with some of these people.
This isn't some impersonal thing.
We're personally involved whether we want to be or not.
We would do anything in our power to try to resolve this.
It's a difficult situation for both Chief Hoffman and I to deal with.
I can't tell you what it's like.
It's tearing us up.
MAN:
Left! Left!
Left, right, left!
Left! Left!
Left, right, left!
Minnesota governor
Rudy Perpich called the National Guard, trying to help maintain order, as striking union meatpackers and their supporters blockaded the Hormel plant in Austin, Minnesota.
- Hey, your clubs are cracked!
- Holy shit! Look at them go!
Behind the barricades.
MAN: I don't know if you know, but this is your community, not two or three of them greedy executives!
What the hell's the matter with you? Shut it down!
Shut her down!
I want, no matter what happens, if anybody gets hit, if anybody gets hit, you simply try to identify who it is, but get back to that hall!
Wait a minute.
You see what they got here?
There ain't no way you got a chance on dealing with those clubs!
So you better think rationally!
I don't want to see you in a fight with the National Guard!
Okay, remember, if anybody moves on you, just go back to the office.
There's varying opinions from everyone here as to how many people are gonna cross the line.
But it sounds as though you're gonna have a stampede situation.
If what everybody is reflecting is accurate.
MAN:
Let's get our people and tell 'em the straight shot, like they deserve.
We got lots of folks that are gonna go in there tomorrow because the Guard's gonna let everybody in.
So let's all go back in tomorrow.
I don't think there's gonna be that many going in tomorrow.
I don't think we've shown our last shot.
I'm not ready to give up.
- No.
- Shit, not me.
I got some real problems because I can see tomorrow and you guys can't.
But, boy, that's what makes me sick.
Go home and take a couple aspirin.
You'll feel better in the morning.
Jesus Christ,
I won't feel a bit better.
Left, left, right, left.
I've been out of work for six years. I need a job.
NARRATOR:
How have you been getting by?
Just doing odd jobs.
Must be hard. You ever worked in a packinghouse?
No.
- Where are you from?
- McIntyre.
- How'd you hear about it?
- Been on the news.
I got neighbors that work here.
Does it feel hard to go across the picket line?
No.
- Scab!
- Hey, you lowlife!
When you go across that line, that's your decision.
You just don't let it bother you.
You'd better be able to stand it, or you should have never went across.
NARRATOR:
Why are you doing this?
Because I need a job.
When was the last time you worked?
Oh, last spring.
- Where are you from?
- Austin.
Okay.
You're crossing a picket line!
You're a scab!
Hey, scab, go home!
Go home, scab!
JIM: Some people may be looking for excuses to cross.
But remember that your self-respect will be left behind if anyone decides to cross the picket line.
You know, my family is starving.
I'm not getting a thing from anybody other than $40 a week, just like everybody else in here.
I want my job, just like everybody in here wants their job.
I'm seriously considering crossing.
I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't.
Don't do it!
I didn't say I was.
I said I was considering.
What I'm saying is, a lot of you people, and you'd be liars if you say you didn't, haven't considered crossing.
Because we all need jobs.
What plan of action is everybody here looking for?
I think we're all looking for some plan of action.
Either we gotta shut down every plant that Hormel owns Monday morning.
Or Tuesday or Wednesday we might as well all go back if we don't shut down their goddamn plants and shut 'em down fast.
I think that you guys can't keep going and saying, "l agree."
The company says they're not gonna meet.
The company says they're not gonna give.
They're not gonna give Monday, not Tuesday, not Wednesday.
And all that time, you got some more guys going in, and so what we're all saying is you gotta either shut down the other plants
or, like you said, all go in en masse and work without a contract.
But it's gotta be one or the other.
It can't be dragged out and waiting for the company to give you something.
They told you they ain't gonna give you anything else.
Now we're looking at shutting the other operations down.
Don't you feel that that's a much more pressurizing strategy on this company at this time?
Especially in light of the fact that those people know that whatever happens here is gonna happen to them.
We need to communicate that.
Mm-hmm.
Don't you think that that's a better position to be into?
If you can't shut them down completely, you've accomplished nothing, other than getting a whole lot of people fired and out of work.
What I'm saying to you is, at what cost are you prepared to take roving pickets to that plant?
What are you gonna do when they say,
"You screwed me out of a job.
Now what are you gonna do?"
I'll say it. Hell, there's nothing we can do for them.
That's the risk we take.
Not we take.
They take.
Okay.
It's the risk they take.
We all take.
Yeah, we took it willingly, and we took it to start with.
Now for our fight, we're dragging them in.
JIM: When does the realization come to those folks that our fight is indeed their fight?
When are we gonna do it if we don't do it now?
Mr. Nyberg, what will Hormel do if P-9 sets up picket lines at your other plants?
Our employees know that it is our position that they'd be in violation of the contracts if they voluntarily stay out and honor the picket line of Local P-9 or however many pickets there might be.
We know that if they do stay out that they will be subject to replacement just as employees in Austin are subject to replacement.
The Executive Board of Local P-9
decided to recommend that the picket line be extended
to all other Hormel plants in an attempt to shut them down.
With that came the promise that if anyone at the other plants
got fired for honoring
P-9's picket line,
no P-9ers would return to their jobs
until the company agreed to rehire everyone.
You know, when you talk about being illegal, at one time, it was illegal to go out on strike.
At one time, it was illegal to join a union.
I guess at one time, it was illegal for America to even exist.
The Executive Board has passed a motion.
Roving pickets will be sent to other plants.
If this is approved, it'll send a message to the company, to everyone else.
We made a promise.
We swore we'd always remember.
No retreat, no surrender.
Speaking on the motion...
It's a unanimous
Executive Board recommendation.
All those in favor signify by saying "aye."
CROWD:
Aye!
Those opposed.
Ayes have it.
I repeat.
This is a union picket line.
We ask that you do not cross it.
Take the day off.
One damn day is all we ask.
All Hormel plants will be shut up tight as a drum by Friday.
There will be none running, to our knowledge.
We'd appreciate your support.
Go home and have a cup of coffee.
Go talk to Ma and the kids before they go to school.
MAN:
There's no way on God's creation that I'm gonna cross their picket line!
When I looked at a guy
I worked with for seven years.
I live in the same town he does,
22 miles up the road.
And I said to him,
"How do you feel?"
He said, "My heart's pumping."
I looked at another guy
I worked with for seven years.
I said, "How do you feel?"
He said, "My heart's pumping."
I said, "Guess what?
You're union people."
We ain't crossing no picket lines!
We ain't crossing them!
What miracle do we expect to happen in the next three days?
That's the question.
What miracle?
How or why?
We have tremendous spirit, we've got a wonderful program.
And we seem to think that if we just go one day at a time, like an alcoholic.
Just keep the strike going one more day, and after today's over, it'll keep going tomorrow.
What do we expect is gonna happen?
I'm mystified.
Scabs!
Go back to your own town, scabs!
Asshole! Go to hell!
I hope you rot in hell!
You're the one that really hurts, Steve.
All these other guys are dicks.
When you went across there, you really hurt.
What the hell's the matter with you?
How can you work with those scabs?
Doesn't it bother you to go in there with guys like that?
Then you got no class.
I don't know you.
Who's your smiley partner?
I've known that guy since we were in grade school.
It's killing him inside.
He's told me that.
I tried to talk him out of it.
He said no.
It's what he had to do.
My wife and children have been my backbone.
They've just.
"No way."
They knew in their minds that if I did,
I couldn't live with myself.
RON: If things haven't changed substantially in two or three days,
I will base my decision on the fact that my family is number one in my life, not my union.
NARRATOR: Are you gonna go across the picket line?
So it appears it.
At this stage of the game, well, it would be tough, but I can't see any alternative.
Now that we've been working on this for a year and a half trying to figure out the difference between right and wrong,
I believe that I was a dupe,
I was lied to originally.
And now he's got control of my whole life.
On the other hand, it's a question of morality, because I was brought up that you do not cross a picket line, no matter what.
It's something that you do not do.
Because you don't belong to a union all these years and develop all these principles.
It isn't like a dollar bill.
You can't throw it on the ground and be rid of it.
As much as I want my job back,
I've still been a good union member for many years.
But I don't know.
My family comes first.
My daughter goes to work.
She's got a part-time job.
My boy, he works at McDonald's, part-time job.
My wife goes to work.
She's got a job.
And what do I do? I sit home, and I play with the cat.
What kind of provider is that?
It may sound corny, but a person takes pride in being a breadwinner and providing for your family.
When you can't do that, when you say to them,
"All I want to do is work," and they...
It's tough.
But I spent more than we should have.
But I want to go back to work.
And the hell with P-9.
I'm ready.
NARRATOR:
Is that hard for you?
You bet.
Why?
Not being able to -- excuse me.
[ Voice breaking ]
Provide for my family.
[ Crying ]
I just can't talk no more.
You're scared to see all them people you've worked with.
All these people are standing there hollering at you.
Yet, you know you have to go across. there's some in there, you think,
"I don't care if you ever come back."
You see people you talk to every day, and it almost makes you cry.
There are some good friends of mine.
That's the ones you feel like you're betraying.
- Where you guys going?
- To work.
- You got a pass for that?
- You want to see our cards?
Just Hormel cards?
You want to see them?
Yeah.
You new employees?
No, no. Not by any stretch of the imagination.
WOMAN: To some, staying out no longer makes sense.
There is more here than a town divided, as brother watches brother cross the line in a place not big enough for anyone to hide for very long.
He won't be my brother if he crosses the line.
For me, it wasn't tough to get to the point of the gate.
I was ready.
But the minute we crossed that line, part of me just stayed back there.
Well, unionism, to me, is watching out not only for your own job, but you're an organization for the welfare and benefit of all the workers.
And now, you know, for this moment, we aren't.
Because we left them.
You know, I wasn't always
International president.
I used to work in the grocery stores, you know.
And I know what it is to work for peanuts.
And you think I like the fact that our people got to roll their wages back a bit?
I don't.
But I tell you what.
I don't take people over a cliff.
There's an old rule in the labor movement.
Anybody can put people on the street.
It takes a man to put them back to work. I'm sorry.
It takes a man or a woman to put them back to work.
Now is the time to settle it.
Hopefully, we can work it out through the course of our local union.
If we don't, then in a short period of time, I'll settle it.
- Question.
- I'll settle it.
- How will you settle it?
- I told you I'll settle it.
I have a meeting.
Thank you.
The United Food and Commercial
Workers Union ordered 1,000 members of its meatpackers local to end their bitter seven-month strike against Hormel in Austin, Minnesota.
The International Union said it had lifted its sanction of the walkout and cut off $40-a-week benefits to strikers.
But pickets remained in place through the day.
WOMAN: It is a strike, those on the line say, is becoming symbolic of the struggle to keep trade unions alive.
If they end up operating that plant nonunion and your guys never get back in there, will you consider that a big defeat for you?
Or not?
Number one, if I say there's no way I could look at this as a defeat, then you're gonna say,
"How can you say that?
Now, you either win or you're gonna lose."
And let's talk about what has happened here and about the types of victory and defeat you can have.
If all the workers lose their job here, okay, if that's a scenario that you're playing, yeah, that is certainly a defeat that way.
But when you consider the fight these people have fought.
Are you saying that 1,000 guys lose their jobs, and because they've got intense national attention on these important problems that confront labor, that could still be a victory?
No, what I am saying, there's been a set of dynamics that has occurred both with all the people in this area, within this community, and within the labor movement.
That cannot be considered anything but positive.
JIM:
I think that we at P-9 started this small labor dispute.
It quickly escalated into a labor dispute that represented a lot of things.
Taking on one of the corporate giants in an industry.
Taking on one of the largest international unions in the country.
And really recognizing the forces that working people have to deal with.
If a small union in the middle of a cornfield in Minnesota can do the kinds of things we do...
We just need to get about the business of doing it.
LEWIE: I don't believe the membership elects leaders to be heroes at their expense.
Talks about dignity and everybody going back together.
What dignity is there when you don't have a job?
There's no dignity at all.
In June of 1986,
the International took over the local union
and threw out the elected leadership of Local P-9.
The main things that the order covers is if anybody physically confronts the UFCW, if they remove assets, or if they hold themselves out to be representing Local P-9 rather than just saying they're a member of P-9.
Do I have to say I'm suspended?
The order's pretty clear on that.
I got to say I'm suspended?
The International Union
negotiated a settlement with Hormel,
whereby the people who crossed the picket line
would receive the same wages and benefits as workers
at the other Hormel plants.
$10.25 per hour.
We didn't stand by the company.
We stood by the International Union.
Kiss my ass!
Kiss my ass!
You're full of shit.
You went back to save your ass and save your job.
By God, we needed our jobs.
We took our chances with Hormel with the hope that unionism would somehow survive.
We left the union and we went back to our jobs.
That's where it was.
[ Booing and jeering ]
Go ahead.
You can scream and holler.
Get that out of your system.
Then we can proceed.
There's one part in the contract that I must have missed.
It's the part that says they have to take me and the rest of all these guys back.
This is the way I feel.
Hormel's will never take me back unless I put it in the contract or you put it in the contract.
And if that's not in the contract, all this bullshit of a contract don't mean nothing to me.
Because how many days' vacation or how much of this they get.
I don't get none of it, because
I didn't get back in the plant.
The contract did not contain any provisions
for the people who honored the picket line.
These people were placed on a waiting list.
It's time, and I think you people have realized, too.
Had we pulled together two years ago,
I don't think you or us would be faced with this.
But I think it's the thing that's going on in America, and I think we as men and women have to realize we better start pulling together, or, by God, they're gonna bury us.
Part of why it's gonna be so hard to leave is because I'm gonna have to leave my mom and dad.
My dad's still out on strike, and I feel like
I'm abandoning him, almost.
But we feel like we have to get on with our lives for the kids.
They need a normal atmosphere they can grow up in.
I know my dad will be okay,
'cause he's a survivor.
And he knows that we're still behind him 100%.
We're not abandoning him.
We're just taking our fight somewhere else.
As far as the strike goes, it was time.
It was past time.
Mike took a stand and refused to go across the picket line.
I'm glad he wouldn't, because
I wouldn't have wanted him to.
LEWIE: You hear this business of "Old Jay Hormel, if he was around, things wouldn't run this way," or "We got this new crop of executives, and they've changed the direction."
They didn't change nothing.
Hormel changed because it was to their advantage to change.
They realized there was profits and growth by pursuing this strategy.
And they did it.
All of a sudden, they're not benevolent anymore and they're not so paternalistic.
They become barracudas, just like everybody else.
We can't look to unions and say,
"You gotta stop this."
It's gonna take a combination of outrage from people.
Whether you support a union or you don't, is it right for these companies to do this?
It can't be dealt with just on the picket line and just at the bargaining table.
You're not looking at short-term fixes here.
When the union's inspiration
Through the workers' blood shall run
There will be no power greater
Anywhere beneath the sun
Yet, what force on Earth is weaker
Than the feeble strength of one
And the union makes us strong
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
And the union makes us strong
In our arms is placed a power
Greater than their hoarded gold
Greater than the might of armies
Magnified a thousand fold
We can bring together the new world
From the ashes of the old
And the union makes us strong
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
And the union makes us strong
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Every conflict for the last 70 years has its own defining images:
Vietnam...
China...
Iraq...
( Gunshot ) - ...
And now Iran.
- - June 20th, 2009, a young iranian woman is shot in the heart by a sniper a a won.
Is martyrered won susuenen became the symbmb of everybody else that was martyred by the islamic Republic.
The voice which you are hearing that's calling her... "neda, please!
Neda, please!"
Is like "no, stay with us!
Don't go!
" This is just so shocking.
She started looking... looking to the camera, looking to us.
"Look.
I'm... I'm dying.
Look. I'm dying.
I was killed."
And she died with open eyes.
This was amazing.
I was there.
  I saw that innocent girl dying
just in front of my eyes.
And I know that Iran will never be the same after neda's death and after that video.
People of the world
will never look at Iran
the same way they looked at it before neda's death.
Within hours
of her death,
neda's dying moments,
captured on cell phones,
were appearing on computer screens across the world.
The neda video was, in my opinion,
was the world's most successful viral video.
Somebody who captured this video on their cell phone was able to get that video in the hands of presidents, prime ministers, kings and influential leaders all around the world in matter of moments.
Have you seen this video?
I have.
 - What is your reaction?
It's heartbreaking, and I think that anybody who sees it knows that there's something fundamentally unjust about that.
Neda's death focused world attention
on mass protests against
every election in Iran.
As millions of iranian protesters
with their distinctive
green wristbands
marched through
the capital, tehran,
others were soon
marching with them
in over 100 cities
across the world.
Neda's blood-spattered face
appeared on t-shirts
and placards.
People everywhere were moved to honor her.
In Paris, the celebrated
photographer reza deghati
turned over his entire
staff and studio
to the task of creating neda masks,
which were sent to capital cities across the world
and worn by protesters
rallying to the cry
"we are neda."
The persian name neda means "voice."
Neda agha soltan
had indeed
become the voice
and the spirit
- of an iranian revolution.
People everywhere
sat up and watched
as moments of extraordinary courage
in the face of brutality
were distributed to the world via the net.
But how much is known
about this young woman
who's become such a powerful symbol to millions?
Who was she?
What did she stand for?
Why did she die?
Her family still lives in Iran.
And though her mother has
posted pictures of neda
and answered written questions on the net,
no one has been
able to hear
neda's story firsthand.
Was there some way of making direct contact
with this family?
All foreign media are
banned from Iran
and those who try
to enter secretly
put themselves and everyone
they meet at risk.
Would any iranian
journalist
be prepared to approach this family?
Every response
was negative.
And they were right to be afraid.
In the weeks and months
following neda's death,
Iran's citizen journalists
were posting shocking proof
of state violence and arbitrary arrests on the web.
Who would run the risk of provoking a regime
capable of this kind
of violence?
After a long search,
a strong candidate emerged:
Saeed kamali dehghan,
24 years old and a man with a reputation for courage.
He accepted
the challenge.
Saeed had been in lran
during the protests
reporting for the London
"guardian" and c.N.N.
He was also the first person to discover
neda's family name
and the apartment
where she lived with her parents and a younger brother.
Saeed had no filmmaking experience,
but was given a crash course in the basics
and a camera that looked
sufficiently amateur
to get through customs
and security in Iran.
On November 17th,
saeed left for tehran
via Paris and Dubai,
armed only with
a list of questions
for neda's family.
Early on the morning
of November 20th,
he emailed back
with the news that
he'd gotten safely through
customs and security
and was now
ready to begin
his assignment
in tehran.
- - Dehghan
- I was completely alone,
facing the greatest
challenge of my life.
First I contacted neda's brother.
Four days later, I got a message that the family had agreed to meet me.
I remember that first night.
I was very nervous.
My stomach was churning.
As I rang the bell, I was sure that someone from the intelligence service would appear at any moment.
I was walking into the home of the girl who had become the symbol of freedom for our nation.
I was carrying flowers and as I went in,
I saw neda's photo on the wall.
I was so tense that I burst into tears and the family had to calm me down.
After a second meeting,
the message came through
that neda's family
had agreed to be filmed.
Saeed was going in the following night with his camera,
and he sent a list
of people to contact
if there was no news
of him after three days.
"My God," I thought.
"I'm actually filming
in neda's home."
When I went
into her bedroom,
i thought, "neda used to
walk in here every day.
This is where she slept.
"
She was no longer
a stranger.
Neda's mother was immediately warm towards me.
At first I addressed her as Mrs.
Rostami,
but in no time I was
calling her mother.
I was alone in bringing up my child.
My husband mostly worked away from home.
We talked for hours about neda.
According to her mother , neda was a rebel
almost from the moment
she was born.
From the age of three, she never accepted control.
She fought with the school authorities not to wear a chador and she won that battle.
In those days, all high-school girls where we were had to wear the chador,
but she rebelled against this.
 She refused.
Neda was the first girl in her school
not to wear a chador.
Neda was always very
Frank with everyone.
She never said anything behind your back.
She always used to say,
"why don't you tell people what you really think?"
On the second night,
neda's elder sister hoda
drove us to her own apartment
and she confirmed everything her mother had said about neda.
She was really very very brave.
And because she wasn't afraid of everything, she didn't have to lie.
No opportunity was lost to share photographs,
stories, memories.
I could almost feel the relief to have this opportunity
to tell the world
who neda really was
and to be as strong
and optimistic as she was
even in their grief.
Did neda have
your smile?
She was always smiling.
You would have to search for a moment when she didn't want to smile.
She's smiling in almost all the photographs.
She was always smiling.
This family was holding
tightly to neda's memory.
This is the last little dress she bought.
She never had a chance to wear it.
Neda's younger brother Mohammed was
the closest to neda.
 As a sign of mourning,
he has neither cut his hair nor shaved since neda died.
She used to say that women in this country cannot live like human beings.
She used to say, "as a woman,
I can't even go outside without being covered up."
Neda's father Ali works
for a transport company
and is often
away from home,
but he understood
neda very well.
She was a fearless child.
There was no fear in her body.
I loved her and respected her so much for this courage.
Neda... outspoken, brave,
clashing with authority
almost from the start.
A free spirit confined
by a regime
that does not value
these qualities in a woman.
After the revolution, the first targets, the first victims of the revolution were women.
The first progressive law they repealed was the family protection law, which protected women at work and at home.
And the first targets again were women's clothing, the veil.
And some of the most reactionary laws... like changing the age of marriage from 18 to nine, depriving women of their civil and judicial rights... and every single reactionary law, the worst kind pertains to women.
A woman risks arrest
if seen in public in the company of any male
other than a close relative.
By law, her arms,
legs and hair
must be covered
whenever men are present,
even on the beach.
In the major cities,
women push the boundaries
as far as they dare,
sometimes sporting
colorful headscarves
and even exposing
their hair,
but they risk arrest
at any time
by the police or the notorious basij militia,
men and women charged
with maintaining
- public order and decency.
I was 15, 16, walking in the streets of tehran and all of a sudden a basij car stopped.
Six of them got out of the car with their ak-47s and surrounded me... they wouldn't look at me... and said, "sister, your chest is showing."
Maybe a quarter size of my chest was showing.
I had worn my hijab and tied it in the back.
And they were wanting to take me with them.
I started to scream,
"how dare you look at me from across the street and are looking at my chest.
You're no mehram.
 I won't let you arrest me.
You have to bring somebody else to arrest me."
And they thought, "okay, she's crazy.
We'd better leave this one alone."
But yes, it's humiliating.
Humiliating.
In many parts
of the country,
all-enveloping black
is the norm.
As a woman, you have to disappear in the public eye.
You cannot be.
And so the more you attract attention to yourself, the more you are targeted because you are supposed not to be.
You are supposed to be invisible.
What is unbearable and ignominious is the power that a regime claims to control your body, and this is a direct attack to your freedom and dignity.
And I think that is what makes the whole issue of a dress code unbearable.
Neda hated this head cover.
She was tormented that she could not swim in the sea and be herself in the street.
She really suffered because of that forced hijab.
The law restricts
women's freedom
in many other ways.
She may not marry
without the consent
of her father or paternal grandfather.
Divorce is the exclusive right
of the husband, who automatically takes possession
of the children
at the age of seven
or even earlier if the woman marries again.
Most serious of all,
the value of a woman's life , half that of a man's.
In court, the weight
of a woman's testimony
half that of a man's...
particularly unjust
in cases of violent assault or rape.
If the man says, "no, I did not assault the woman."
The woman says, "yes, you did," she has no chance of obtaining a conviction against the man.
Even worse, the woman would subsequently be indicted for bringing false testimony.
Iran has the highest rate of execution
of any country
in the world
as a proportion
of the population.
Apart from murder, the death penalty has been imposed for adultery,
possession of drugs,
homosexual acts
and even
non-violent protest.
The age of criminal responsibility
for a girl is eight , for a boy, 14.
If an eight-year-old girl
commits a capital offense,
she might remain in jail
awaiting execution
on her 18th birthday.
For certain crimes, the death penalty is not administered by hanging but by stoning.
And stoning happens in a way that you are being buried in sand or in the ground up to your waist.
And the rule is if you manage to get out while people are throwing stones at you, you are free. You can leave.
That's the rule for a man.
However, woman are not being buried up to their waist but up to their breast with their arms also being buried.
Laughing )
Such a contrast
between the warmth and normality of this family
and that other lran
outside their doors.
And such courage,
knowing what this regime
is capable of.
Yet they feel safer
by speaking out.
The fact is that neda's family now belong to the whole nation, so there are... people feel responsible tordrds them.
Anything that happens to them will just incite a new rage, and I'm sure that the government doesn't want that.
So somehow, yes, they are protected by the love of the people of Iran towards neda.
The family held nothing back.
Neda's poems and her private diaries.
Day after day,
"meet meet meet" Amir,
the man she had loved
since she was a teenager
and married in 2004
when she was 21.
They were together for three and a half years and then they divorced.
Her husband's family was from the north.
Neda was from tehran.
They were two opposite cultures.
She tried hard to save the marriage.
It wasn't a bitter divorce.
Somehow she never stopped loving Amir.
She always said that the way she loved was not the way that she was loved.
She had high expectations when it came to affections and emotions.
That is why nobody could satisfy her emotional needs.
Amir... even I couldn't love her the way she expected us to.
Neda's books,
including banned books,
were proudly displayed,
among them, hermann hesse's "siddhartha,"
"the last temptation
of Christ,"
"one hundred years
of solitude"
and bronte's
"wuthering heights."
Almost all the books that she's reading are books that, by nature,
are subversive of what
the regime preaches.
"Wuthering heights" is
interesting to me, partly of course, because it was very dangerous.
It is about love, passion and the sacredness
and beyond
"wuthering heights,"
kazantsakis's
"freedom or death."
These books
are so different, and that shows the curiosity... a mind that just wants to know, has the urge to know.
Thirst for knowledge
and what her mother descri
d as strong religious faith
brought neda here to tehran's azad university
to study islamic philosophy.
As in most government buildings like this court,
beremen are inspected
to ensure there is
no trace of makeup,
no infringement of the strict dress code.
I went to High School in Iran and it would happen at the high schools, where they would line us up and they would inspect to see if any of the girls had makeup.
They would inspect to see if you were properly dressed, if your hair was showing.
And the way the women would treat you, it was awful, really, the way they would slap you on the cheek if you had makeup, or come with something and wipe the makeup off very hard and harsh.
It's very humiliating for women.
Ilham... not
- Her real name...
went to college
with neda.
To protect her family in Iran,
her identity
must be concealed.
Once neda was arguing with one of the women about her nail Polish or maybe the red lipstick she wore.
I had just arrived and I was also wearing red lipstick and pink high heels, which is completely forbidden in our university.
That woman was very busy arguing with neda, and neda winked an eye at me, like, "okay, go.
I'm already fighting with her."
And I was just sneaking behind her and ran away, and went to the university.
She even started arguing much louder so that the woman put all her attention to neda, and I was just a sneaking behind her and then ran away...
To go to the campus.
After just two terms,
neda dropped out.
She used to say, "the God they are teaching us at these universities is different from the God I worship."
Her Professor taught them about a vengeful God, but neda said, "this is not my God.
The God I worship is a compassionate and loving God."
The whole idea with this regime is thatececause they confiscated religion and turned it into an ideology, they deprived it of everything that makes religion humane, of everything that a girl like neda would be attracted to.
So this government, in fact, destroyed religion
by claiming it
and confiscating it.
Young people are turning away
from religion in droves
because they look and see
what the government is doing
in the name of religion.
When they mention the name go you say in arabic what the government is doing in the name of religion.
"Bismillah hir rahman nir raheem."
What does that translate to?
"In the name of God, the compassionate and the merciful."
It's what you say... it's what you say as... and yet this lot have interpreted this as if to say "in the name of God, the bad-tempered and nasty."
According to her mother,
neda decided to pursue a career
that would give her
the freedom to travel.
She used to tell me "even if it's just for one day before my death,
I want to live outside Iran."
She started to go to a language course to learn turkish.
Neda visited
Turkey again and again,
sometimes working
as a tour guide.
Here she could dress
as she wanted
and roam free
among friends,
but back in Iran
her only freedom was
behind closed doors.
Dancing, arab dancing,
was her obsession,
and music...  Western and turkish pop.
But above all, the music of googoosh...
...An iranian superstar.
Neda took singing classes
and practiced the songs
of her idol, googoosh.
After the revolution,
I lived under that regime for 21 years, much like neda.
I was banned from performing, even from appearing in public.
I spent a month in prison.
I was interrogated four times in evin prison.
Googoosh eventually left Iran,
free again to perform.
Her songs spoke directly
to neda's heart.
It's wonderful that my music resonated so well with neda, but her voice is more powerful than min she speaks to all the world.
As the family laid out more and more
that was personal
to neda,
it was difficult to think of her as this great symbol,
the voice of the nation.
Here was a girl
who always wanted
to look her best,
who worked out
at the gym
and followed her own
strict diet plan.
A girl who wanted
to listen to the music
and read the books she loved,
to indulge herself in the coolest fashions
and who dreamed
of a relationship
where all the love
she could give
would be givenacack
to her in return.
In so many ways,
any girl anywhere.
But this wasn't anywhere.
This was the islamic
Republic of Iran,
where even the clothes you wear
have a political meaning.
Neda became a heroine,
not because she was different, but in fact she shared the same desires with million of young girls who live around the world.
They all want the same thing.
But what did make neda different
from those millions
of other young girls
was her exceptional
courage and strength.
And in June of last year
that strength was
put to the test.
Ine cumbent
mahmoud ahmadinejad,
was seeking re-election
to the presidency.
The whole process was
suspect from the start.
Most of the manipulation and fabrication happened before the elections.
Ahmadinejad had access
to government resources.
He went around
the country
and spent money like
there was no tomorrow.
He was paying people hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars to vote for him, building schools here and there, building roads all over the country.
And they didn't even care about finishing the roads.
They just started the roads in order to get the votes.
But that was just the beginning.
475 people, including members of parliament
and former ministers,
had put theinanames forward
as potential challengers,
but after the all-powerful
guardian council
had worked
through the list,
only three opposition names were left.
All of them,
or so it seemed,
safe establishment figures:
Mousavi, a former prime minister;
Karoubi, a former
parliamentary speaker;
And rezaie, the former head
of the revolutionary guard.
This was not a revolution in the making.
This was simply an election under the rules established by the islamic Republic.
And neda, like millions
of other young people,
would have nothing
to do with it.
She used to say, "the election has been decided.
The election is futile.
It's obvious that aadadinejad will be president.
The person who has the most followers will never be preside h here."
Then something
remaabable happened.
R r the first time er, r,
ririval candidates went head to head
with ahmadinejad
... they attttracted h heeiauauences.
 - ( Crcrd d chrsrsses.
... They attttracted h heeansari:Ces.
 -What those debates did
was it defined
for people
what they disliked
about ahmadinejad.
I mean he came across as a deeply deeply unpleasant character,
very certain of his own position,
conceited and quite abusive
to his opponents.
He threatened to reveal various dossiers about mousavi's wife.
He said, "shall I reveal the file?
 Shall I reveal the file?"
Mousavi quite rightly said, "this is exactly what we don't want.
We don't want government officials to build up dossiers
about the citizens and then threaten to reveal them."
I think people then realized that this was almost like a fight to the death.
I mean, when the stakes became really high, and they realized this wasn't just a piece of theater, they thought, "well, let's go vote."
Even before the first debate was over
people were celebrating
in the streets.
Neda had been at our house during the tv debate.
After that, she, my husband and
I drove through the streets.
Neda called mom
and told her,
"you're missing
these scenes.
Everybody is out."
And mom complained
tch y r?
It's very sad when you see that joyful week, and you realize what finally happened.
But for that one week,
the atmosphere on the streets was euphoric.
People thought that some changes
can happen inside the country.
Because of that very little change that they were ng they were so jubilant, they were so happy.
It was like
a party scene
for about two, three weeks
before the elections.
This smallest hope that something could change had created an enormous energy among the younger population.
After the four years of despair that had befallen the country,
we were claiming our own destinies and that was exciting.
Mr. ahmadinejad's supporters at and it was amazing to see how both sides respected each other's choice, that, "okay, this part of the street is for us,
that part is for you ," you know?
And there were no police, no authorities,
but people were
so good together.
It was such an amazing experience for all of us.
Mir-hossein mousavi soon emerged
as the opposition
front-runner,
attracting massive crowds
to his rallies.
But it was his wife,
zahra rahnavard,
who gave real luster
to his campaign,
even holding rallies
of her own.
A woman playing
a major role
in a political campaign...
this really was
a breakthrough
in the islamic
Republic of Iran.
June 12th, election day.
There was real optimism
in the air
and people were off to the polls early in the morning.
Then suspicions
started to build.
Opposition candidates
complained
that their phone and email communication
had been obstructed
and their observers
denied admission
to the polling stations.
Neda went with Mohammed to three voting stations, but there were no representatives for the opposition candidates.
She clashed with the people there.
She said, "well, whose representative is here?"
And they said, "just the representative of ahmadinejad."
She said, "this is nonsense ," and she didn't vote.
That evening, while people were still voting,
the basij raided
mousavi's headquarters
and closed it down,
confiscating files
and documents.
The evidence was captured
on cell phones.
They started a mass arrest of political activists all around the country.
If you think it was a healthy election and you are the president of the country, why this?
This is very interesting.
And just two hours after
all the polls had closed,
state television announced
that ahmadinejad had secured
over 60% of the votes
already counted
and was heading for a resounding victory.
In the early hours of the following morning,
ahmadinejad's victory
was confirmed.
How did they know that he had won by 63% when they hadn't even started counting?
And how... and that 60% turned out to be the final result.
You know, this is some kind of fortune-telling.
In my country, they are still counting the votes not by computer or any digital device but people see them counted.
But this time in six hours they finished.
Without a computer or anything?
How is it possible?
All sorts of things build up to a case for a serious serious mishandling of events and a rigging of the elections.
Neda was so angry that she argued with me.
"You told me that mousavi would win.
What happened?"
What was shocking to the population was that even the
limited choice that was supposedly given to them was fake.
If the rigged election was not provocation enough,
on the following evening , Sunday, June 14th,
police and the basij militia
mounted an attack
on tehran university.
One of the aggressors was so appalled at what they were doing
that he recorded the attack on his cell phone,
and later posted his evidence on the web.
Five students
were killed,
over 130 arrested
and imprisoned.
The next day, some of the largest crowds ever seen in this city
finally rose in protest,
and neda was there
from the start.
She joined the others in protest because she felt the iranian people had been insulted.
Even if she hadn't voted herself, her mother, her sister and her friends had voted.
And you could see these millions of people.
I think I saw at least two or three million people on the streets of tehran on June 15th.
They came out
to the streets
and demonstrated
peacefully.
In those four days i think we really witnessed
the maturity...  the political maturity of the iranian people.
They knew what they wanted.
They just wanted
the reversal of votes.
They didn't want ahmadinejad
as their president.
They said, "we have to be quiet.
We have to be very peaceful because we don't want the government to have an excuse to treat us violently."
I could not see where the crowd started and where it ended.
I was just
gazing at them,
saying, "that many people?"
And I got so enthusiastic,
I just shouted "I love you people!
I'm so proud to be one of you!"
I saw representatives of all parts of society:
Women who had covered themselves with the chador,
girls who were
more open,
boys who were
wearing short sleeves,
men with large beards.
All ages, all classes,
religious, non-religious...
all of them.
You saw families.
A very very old woman I saw...
she was about
90 years old...
she could hardly walk , but she came.
The most important part was the silence.
They decided that silence would speak for them.
So they didn't
shout slogans,
they didn't say, "death to this.
 Death to that."
They just held up their hands,
showing the victory sign.
And it was the women who set the tone.
The women's participation was absolutely exceptional.
They were leading the protests.
You see at the forefront of the struggle not just modern, secular women, young women like neda;
You see women wearing the veil and being very traditional side by side with these other women.
Women at the forefront,
and the young.
Neda symbolizes
a generation that this election was all about and this green movement was all about.
She was a girl
trying to get
more freedom.
She didn't want to take power.
She wasn't looking for politics.
She wasn't looking for anything other than some individual freedom
and some freedom
of speech.
Basic rights.
That's why she crystalizes all those hopes and dreams that were shattered after the election.
And neda was on
the protests every day,
sometimes with her sister , her brother,
even her mother.
And on one
of those days,
three basiji women
approached neda.
Very politely, one of these women asked neda,
"dear, please don't come out
looking so beautiful."
Neda smiled with her beautiful teeth and said, "am I beautiful?"
And they said, "you are very very lovely.
Do us a favor
and don't come out because the basiji men target beautiful girls, and they will shoot you."
Then one of them said,
"I'm also a psychologist,
and I know the danger
of beauty to these men".
"And I know the danger
of beauty to these men."
A dreadful omen,
and such an insight into the fundamentalist mind.
Because they cannot control themselves in front of beauty.
They know that if they don't control themselves, they will lose the paradise, they lose their relation to the gods... to the God, so don't look at beauty.
Because if you look at beauty, then the devil will come in your mind and will give you such bad ideas about it.
The whole thing in their lives is that you should control yourself, and they cannot control themselves in front of beauty.
They want to kill it.
On June 16th,
four days after the elections,
the police, the military
and the basij
were unleashed.
To suppress
this evidence,
journalists were cleared
off the streets...
some imprisoned,
others expelled.
I was beaten myself five or six times with a Baton
and I saw people being pushed against a wall and beaten.
The thing that made me most angry, really, was that it was absolutely unprovoked.
A moment, they start shooting.
And there was this very young boy who got murdered a few meters away from me.
I still have nightmares about him.
One person commented to me... he said,
"it's like the mongols have returned.
There is no law in this country."
The anarchy and the violence
being exercised on the streets
didn't come from the demonstrators at all.
It came from
government-sponsored thugs.
And beautifully, of course, it was all captured on these camera phones.
Cell phones
and digital cameras,
creating a massive problem
for the iranian authorities.
Although the journalists
were off the streets,
the information still
kept flowing.
What the authorities had
failed to understand
was that the iranian people themselves
had the courage
and now the know-how
to get the evidence
out to the world.
The 2009 demonstration in Iran is the beginning of the new era in the whole world, in human history of citizen journalism.
- - Citizen journalism.
Through YouTube and networking sites like Twitter,
thcame flooding in. Es
you can hear the screaming on one side,
people running
on another side.
You really get that sense of being there.
People were holding up the camera as if it were a sword, in a way.
And they really understood the rallying power of
"if we can get the global community to know what is happening, that will be our greatest defense, that will be our greatest hope."
The state department
in Washington was
quick off the mark.
Word went out from here
to the headquarters
of Twitter in
San Francisco,
suggesting they might reschedule
a routine
maintenance shutdown
to a more
Iran-friendly time.
Jared Cohen made the call
and soon had the answer he wanted.
Ultimately, I remember getting an email on my BlackBerry late at night, the me day that I had contacted them, saying they worked it out and they were gonna reschedule their maintenance so they'd do it at a time that was convenient for iranians as opposed to a time that's convenient for Americans.
So they did it in the middle of the night Iran time.
The messages pouring out of Iran
brought a strong response
from the young...
the children
of the Internet,
conversing
with each other
and influencing each other
across national borders.
More and more, they are creating a single community
in which authority is
continually questioned.
A prime example...
25-year-old Austin heap.
Freedom is something you have to fight for, it's not something that you wake up and it's just there.
There's always someone out there who wants to control you, tell you what you can and can't do.
I don't consider myself political, but what I do consider myself to be is someone who really pushes back when told what to do.
And I certainly have no respect for a government that uses, you know, brutal and violent methods of controlling people.
This is language that
neda would have understood.
The more brutal they got, the more determined I became to, you know, not give them the power to silence people.
When the authorities
in Iran trd d to stop
the information flow,
filtering the Internet,
Austin and a techie friend fought back.
Citizen journalism
enabled.
The first thing that we did, you know, in the immediate aftermath of the election was set up what are called proxy servers.
And a proxy server... essentially, you configure your computer to use it and then it will bounce your connection through another country.
So instead of connecting from
Iran directly to Facebook, for example... which they block... you connect from Iran to
Australia then to Facebook.
The iranians soon found ways to block the proxies,
so Austin took the challenge to another technical level.
We sat down and thought,
"how can we push the iranian government all the way up against the wall?
How can we take the technology they have and use it against them?"
Austin designed
a system called haystack.
It was an ingenious method
of hiding encrypted data
inside official iranian government traffic.
Soon the major
Western news agencies
were turningo o Austin
to get their information
out of Iran.
I go from being a 24-year-old, spending my time playing video games and hanging out with my friends to all of a sudden having to maintain open communications for an entire country.
And all the time in Iran,
the government's mood
was hardening.
June 19th,
one week after the election,
the supreme leader , khamenei,
addresses the nation.
Unelected by the people,
he was someone considered
to be above politics...
God's representative
on earth.
But on that day,
he crossed a line.
Khamenei made himself the enemy of the people by whole-heartedly supporting ahmadinejad.
He said there was no wrongdoing,
vote rigging is not
possible in Iran, people should go back home or otherwise
I'm going to order the security forces to crush the demonstrations by any means possible.
What religious leader
stands on Friday prayer
in the most religious day of the week
and preaches bloodshed,
threatens his people
with bloodshed
if they come out to peacefully protest?
What kind of a supreme religious adader does that?
On that day
the supreme leader
waged war on the nation.
He virtually signed neda's death sentence on that day.
After khamenei's speech,
it became blatantly obvious
to most people
that this was no longer
about an election.
This is not about whether the vote was rigged one way or another.
It's about whether in the 21st centur in an educated country like Iran there is place for a God king.
We live in a world
where there is no place
for the God king anymore.
The next day, on Saturday the 20th, when people came out to the streets they thought that there was a military regime in power.
I have never seen
that many
revolutionary guards,
police and paramilitary
basij forces
on the streets
in my life.
It was exactly like
starting a war
against the people.
It just made people
much more angry.
Until yesterday we wanted reform.
From now on, just withdrawal of you from power.
That's the end of the islamic
Republic for all of us.
Right after that, I heard
for the very first time,
people chanting,
"death to khamenei.
- Our leader is a dictator. He should be removed.
I begged neda not to go out.
She said, "I have to go.
I have to go.
If I don't go out, who will?"
Anyone out
on the streets that day
was declaring war on the islamic Republic of Iran
and risking a ferocious reaction.
Neda had thought about all the consequences.
She knew there was a risk she'd be tortured, imprisoned or even killed.
She knew all of this, but she was not afraid.
Neda left the house at 3:30.
I rang her at 4:30.
Actually, I rang her every half hour.
I asked her where she was.
She said, "we're in amirabad
and it's like hell."
She said, "there are so many government forces out here.
I've never seen so many
in my life before."
I asked, "what are they doing?"
And she said "what do you think they're doing?
They're chasing us
and beating us."
She said, "mom, I will.
 Todon't worry."Me.
I rang her again
after half an hour
and asked where she was.
She said, "I'm at the clinic.
They threw tear gas at us
and my eyes are burning.
I've lit a cigarette
to stop the burning."
Ed her, "neda, please come home.
Please come back."
She said, "mom, okay, I will."
But neda returned to the fray,
flanked by her singing teacher
in his distinctive
striped blue shirt.
She wears a baseball cap
atop the obligatory black.
Cell phone cameras captured the last minutes of neda's life
and the doctor
who held her
as she died
describes the scene.
What grabbed
my attention was, first,
she was so active, shouting "death to the dictator," acting, supporting others, moving around while her music teacher was trying to pull her back.
But she didn't want to give up.
I was really looking
at her with admiration
because she was a woman,
a young woman,
so courageous.
I was dying out of fear out there, and she was just moving around and shouting, anand that was why I noticed her.
Then the anti-riot police took up their batons and just rushed towards the people, so people just scattered.
All the streets
were blocked,
so people didn't
know which way to go.
It was chaos.
We ran and neda was running beside me.
Her music teacher couldn't run as fast as the others,
so neda turned back all the time to see if he was okay.
And then we heard the blast.
I turned back, looked at neda, who was standing about a meter away from me, and I saw her looking up in astonishment and surprise at the blood that was gushing out of her chest.
And I ran towards her.
From my impression,
she was shot in her aorta.
It is the major blood vessel coming out of the heart.
No one could save her.
In a minute,
she bled out.
Her eyes lost
their light.
Her heart
stopped beating,
she stopped breathing
and I knew she was dead.
I know the footsteps of death.
And when I realized that she was dead,
I stood up and told her music teacher that she's dead. Sorry.
But he didn't want to believe.
A car passing by saw the scene,
stopped and offered to help.
Three or four people
took her body,
put her in the back seat
and the car went away with her body and the music teacher,
hoping to find
a hospital.
Two or three minutes
after the car left
with neda's body, i was still standing there in shock.
I saw people pulling somebody towards us who was shouting "I didn't want to kill her.
By God, I didn't want to kill her."
They had
taken off his shirt
and they were
beating him.
Some even wanted to lynch him.
The others didn't let them do that.
They said, "we're not like them.
We are here for non-violence."
They couldn't have delivered him to the police.
They were afraid that they would compromise their own identities
and the police
would arrest them.
So there was no other way other than letting him go, but they took his I.
D. Cards so that they could later identify him and deliver him for justice.
To date no one has been charged
with neda's murder.
You cannot find the murderer.
You'll never find the murderer.
If the murderer was not from this government, you would have found him.
But because he is from this government, you'll never find him.
Neda was buried
the very next day
in accordance
with Muslim custom,
but the authorities
would not permit
any imam to hold a religious ceremony,
either in a mosque
or at the graveside.
I opened the shroud,
and she was very lovely.
She didn't look
like a dead person.
She was like
someone sleeping.
She was beautiful even after death, like an angel.
It's astonishing how
the government was afraid
of a simple
funeral ceremony.
If she wasn't shot
by their agents, why didn't they let the family do what they wanted to do with the body?
The objective of killing is to make you invisible.
And if once you're dead, you are still visible
and the sadness of your parents is witnessed, the whole purpose of killing you is defeated.
And the clearer it became
that neda,
through her death,
had focused
international attention
on the continuing violence
and repression in Iran,
the more desperate were the efforts of the regime
to neutralize
the neda effect.
First, the official
iranian news agency
announced that neda agha soltan was not dead,
but alive and well,
and living in Greece.
Next, the ambassador of Iran in Mexico said in an interview that she was shot by c.I.A. Agents.
Are you seriously accusing the CIA of killing neda?
The bullet that we found in his... her head was not the bullet that you could find in Iran.
Two days later, e e iranian state media said that she was shot by the b.B.
C. Correspondt t in Iran.
Thenhehe hdd
of the natnal l s sd, d,
"we have s stued the video ananit's fake. E.)
This thihi hasasnener h"
in the next
official version,
neda's death did happen,
and the killer was none other than Dr. hejazi,
working for the
British secret service.
It's laughable, isn't it?
It's laughable that they think that they can get away with these lies.
First it was the c.I.
A, then it was this, then it was... it is unbelievable.
Iran state television
surpassed itself
with a documentary
on the subject.
How did neda agha soltan really die?
Tehran-based press tv relayed its message.
According to
the documentary...
The reporter claimed
that neda was an actress
who splashed her own face with fake blood
but was murdered afterwards
by her companions.
It says hejazi
and neda's music teacher
are members of a team
that carried out the plot.
They built up lies over es over lies over lies and nobody believes them.
That's a fact.
Even they themselves don't believe what they're saying.
Indeed.  The harder they try to undermine the neda effect
the more strongly
her name resonated
both inside
and outside Iran.
Paris, 40 days
after neda's death.
In Muslim tradition,
a special time
of commemoration.
Each candle represents
a life taken.
And all are honored
on neda's 40th day.
But neda's own family was not allowed to mourn publicly
in the tradition
of her faith.
On neda's 40th day, the 30th of July, they told us to stay at home.
Imagine that.
You're made to stay at home on your sister's Memorial Day.
That's terrible.
In spite of government warnings,
tens of thousands
of mourners
made the 12-mile journey
from the city to tehran's
behesht-e zahra cemetery
to honor neda
and those who died
in the same cause,
shouting "our neda is not dead!
This government is dead!"
They were met
by armed police
and militia
who used tear gas
against the mourners.
Recent events have shown how powerless and how fearful this regime is and that violence is the last thing left in its arsenal.
And no regime is able o sustain itself just purely on violence.
But how long can
they hold the line?
Five years from now, will ahmadinejad still be in power?
Will the supreme leader still reig
What is the future here?
Did neda die in vain?
Neda is already
the symbol of freedom.
In the new Republic of Iran, she will be remembered as being one of the most important models and heroes of this freedom.
Neda didn't die in vain, and they won't let her die in vain.
Not her, not every other life that's been lost.
They will change Iran.
It's over.
It's over.
It's a long battle ahead, but it is the beginning of the end.
The iranian poet
Ahmad shamlou once wrote
"our dignity
has been bartered.
We had all the words
in the world,
yet we did not utter
the only word
that mattered... freedom.

Yes.
Yes.
Yes, we still do it.
We also mark our faces and skin.
We paint everything... the jaguar, the fish.
Only after five days....
First we put paint... then charcoal.
It lasts five days.
About four or five days old.
Yes, I did.
Kuberene... and Iroa.
Yes, we played.
I don't remember, it was too long ago.
Kuberene was kind of a sad boy, but a good person.
The other boy was more cheerful... enjoyed playing.
One was more joyful, the other sad.
Yes, they had families.
The aruanas were immortal fishes that lived in hidden lakes inside the earth.
One day, though, Hariua, a smart young aruana... found a shaft of sunlight.
Immediately he remembered the wise advise of Kobehi, the oldest shaman:
''Avoid the shaft of sunlight that comes through a long, narrow, stony path.''
''It leads to suffering, pain, danger and death!''
But a strong feeling of curiosity took the young aruana closer....
We don't have... any written education... we get our knowledge from our parents and families.
They teach us about our destiny, about being an Indian... being a human being, and about life.
If we don't respect our elders... we'll be lost.
We really have to fight to try to maintain the maximum possible... of our culture, our language, our dances.
During the years of colonialism... the whites wanted us to be their slaves.
During the republic they tried... to change us into whites overnight.
They put the hospital here, the hotel, the school... the machines.
We were confused... not knowing how to live in this new situation... and after the years... of white man's civilization... we have to defend ourselves. But how?
By learning something from the whites, in the school.
Yesterday, an Indian... was wounded deep in his back.
He was in great pain.
We'll see if we will have to operate.
I'm seeing an airplane.
It's coming down from the sky.
We teach our children to read.
First in our language, Karaja, then in Portuguese.
Two languages at the same time.
We want to learn only the good things from the whites.
We don't want to live in the town... because there we would learn only... the bad things the whites are doing.
That's why we teach our children, so that won't happen.
Yes.
I liked it very much, I was very happy.
It touched me.
My feelings...
I have missed him a lot since I lost him.
And now, when I saw him...
I was very happy indeed.
I've been feeling so sad... and this was great for me.
It was great to see him alive.
I wish I could still see him.
When I saw him moving...
I felt he was alive again.
My father was killed... when a crocodile attacked him.
It was down at the lake.
He was fishing... with two friends.
He was steering the canoe.
The water was very low.
When the canoe passed over a crocodile... it went crazy and attacked my father... right at his neck.
Yes.
In this village... a lot of things have changed since your last visit.
But for me the saddest thing is that I've lost my husband.
I feel very lonely...
I miss the safety he gave me.
I remember long ago, one night he came into my hut... and the next morning we were husband and wife.
And so he stayed with me.
He was a very good person, very kind and hard working.
Quiet please.
Pat Tillman, safety, Arizona State.
Good, keep looking. That's good.
Pat, can we try that just one more time?
Make sure not to kind of even glance up or look around or anything.
Okay. It's a long-ass time to just sit there.
Yeah, it is.
Here we go.
If they knew anything about my son, they wouldn't have done what they did.
Pat Tillman, safety, Arizona State.
Because he didn't really fit into that box that they would have liked.
Pat Tillman loved the game of football.
Yet, as much as Pat Tillman loved competing on the football field...
...he loved America even more.
Courageous and humble, a loving husband and son...
...a devoted brother and a fierce defender of liberty.
Pat Tillman will always be remembered--
I think they just thought, if they spun the story and we found out...
...we'd just keep it quiet because we wouldn't want to diminish...
...his heroism or anything like that...
...but, you know, nobody question's
Pat's heroics. He was always heroic.
What they said happened, didn't happen.
They made up a story, and so you have to set the record straight.
Good evening, thanks for joining us--
Our top story--
On a more serious and indeed, tragic note--
Live fire rounds all around me--
In the third week of April 2004, the 24-hour news cycle...
...was dominated by two stories about fallen American soldiers.
The first involved an airport worker who had been fired...
...after sharing these photos with her local newspaper.
This sparked debate about a federal law...
...that had been in place since the first Gulf War.
Why should we hear about body bags and deaths?
Americans had been mesmerized by news coverage from the Persian Gulf.
But the military said photos like these...
...violated the privacy of grieving families.
The second story was not considered a violation of privacy.
Pat Tillman, who gave up a multimillion-dollar contract...
...in professional football, has been killed.
At age 25, Pat Tillman was a charismatic defensive back...
...in the national football league...
...with a reputation as a bruising tackler.
But he brushed it all aside...
...when he announced that he would be quitting the NFL...
...joining the Army Rangers along with his brother Kevin...
...and setting off to fight in the Middle East.
Though the media hounded him for an interview...
...Tillman refused to speak publicly about his decision to leave the NFL...
...requesting only that he be looked upon as any other soldier.
But this was a request that, in death, the public could not grant him.
The first thing we heard when we got the news of Pat's death...
...was that he was shot in the head getting out of a vehicle.
That's all we heard.
We didn't get an official story until the memorial service.
If you're the victim of an ambush, there are very few things you can do...
...to increase your chances of survival.
One of which is to get off that ambush point as fast as you can.
One of the vehicles in Pat's convoy...
...could not get off.
He made the call, he dismounted his troops...
...taking the fight to the enemy uphill.
This gave his brothers, in the downed vehicle...
...time to move off that target.
He directly saved their lives with that move.
Pat's memorial service in San Jose, California...
...was carried live by all the major networks.
That service is ongoing right now, as you just saw here on Fox News--
The story recounted in the eulogy was abridged...
...elaborated upon and retold time and again.
According to military accounts,
Tillman ordered his men up a hill...
...to attack terrorists that had pinned down part of his platoon.
All the soldiers in that ambushed platoon were saved.
They were rescued by Pat Tillman.
Tillman directed his team into firing positions.
Tillman's voice was heard issuing commands...
...to take the fight to the enemy forces.
Pat Tillman's family will also receive the Silver Star for his service...
...and his great heroic efforts over there on April 22nd.
Pat was given the Silver Star, the nation's third highest combat honor...
...awarded for valor in battle with enemies of the United States.
A Navy SEAL friend of the family...
...had based his eulogy on the Silver Star narrative.
Pat sacrificed himself so his brothers could live.
What they received was something that was really honorable, you know.
The narrative that they got was something that was befitting a hero.
I knew that there was a massive possibility...
...that other things were gonna come out to bring certain things to light...
...that were gonna completely...
...make that ceremony invalid.
Company.
Present arm.
I remember, we did like this little memorial in Afghanistan for Pat.
You know, I mean, fuck, everybody showed up.
It was terrible.
It was terrible seeing everybody.
Everybody was just lost, shocked, frustrated.
Sound off for roll call.
- Specialist Atkins.
- Here, first sarge.
- Sergeant Elroy.
- Here, first sarge.
- Specialist Norman.
- Here, first sarge.
Specialist Tillman.
Specialist Patrick Tillman.
Specialist Patrick Daniel Tillman.
I knew we were gonna get debriefed.
And they were gonna pick it apart and figure out what happened.
And people were gonna get punished and people were gonna be leaving.
I didn't expect to ever, you know, be on a plane like two hours later.
They knew what the relationship was between me, Kevin and Pat.
And they told me:
"You're the closest to the brothers, we want you to fly back with Kevin.
It's not your place to tell the family anything.
You need to keep your mouth shut about it.
You need to not cause any type of turmoil."
And I-- You know, I said, okay. Yeah.
They put us into a cargo plane that was completely empty.
The only thing in it, right there in the middle, was Pat's coffin.
And they covered it with an American flag.
Just sitting across from Kevin and looking at him, I couldn't say anything.
I barely said two words to Kevin the whole time we were flying home.
I was afraid that he might ask me what happened to Pat.
Russell Baer came to our house after Pat's memorial service...
...and my ex-husband, or Pat's father...
...asked Russell to tell the story of what happened to Pat.
The position he was in while he was over at the house...
...was, I'm sure, very awkward.
It appeared very awkward.
At the time, it seemed that he was still very upset...
...and rattled by the whole setting, and Pat's death...
...because he liked Pat a lot.
I went into Pat's mom's living room and I gave them my narrative...
...excluding certain possibilities.
And Russell Baer told us nothing.
Initially, I was not real pleased with Russell Baer.
It upset me that this kid...
...that's supposed to be a friend of the family's, didn't say anything.
But we found out about five weeks later, the reason.
A reporter from the Arizona Republic contacted me.
It was peculiar because I hadn't heard from the media for quite a few weeks.
And I just got a very eerie feeling, and when I called him back...
...he asked me what I thought about the news the Army had given us...
...and I didn't know what he was talking about.
So I basically prodded him to tell me...
...and he said that, you know, there was a suspicion...
...that Pat was killed by fratricide,
"friendly fire."
The U.S. Army now says Pat Tillman was not killed by enemy fire.
It was dark, the terrain was rough.
To put it another way, it was the fog of war.
Now the Army says, Tillman's death was apparently an accident.
The investigation results indicate that Corporal Tillman...
...probably died as a result of friendly fire...
...while his unit was engaged in combat with enemy forces.
It was determined that
I was to give the press conference.
My role during this period...
...was commander of the U.S. Army
Special Operations Command.
I commanded the Green Berets...
...Civil Affairs, SIOPs, the 160th Aviation...
...the Rangers and a number of our Special units.
It was General Kensinger's job to explain why five weeks earlier...
...the military had reported that Pat was killed by the Taliban.
You know,
I don't wanna sound trite...
...but there's an old Army adage that says first reports are incorrect.
There is an inherent danger of confusion in any firefight...
...particularly when a unit is ambushed.
During the press conference...
...and at a subsequent private briefing with the Tillman's...
...the Army said Pat had been killed by an errant U.S. bullet...
...during a chaotic ambush.
The ambush was conducted by 10 to 12 enemy personnel...
...from multiple locations--
According to them, things were confusing...
...and it's an unfortunate accident.
I know I felt like they haven't really looked into this well enough...
...to give me an explanation, and I don't much appreciate that.
The results of this investigation...
...in no way diminish the bravery and sacrifice displayed...
...by Corporal Tillman.
In the process of this explanation,
I asked one of them:
"Why then award him a Silver Star?
You don't give a Silver Star for attitude."
He goes, "Well, we did in this case."
You don't wanna think the worst of the people that you're dealing with.
Our thoughts and our prayers remain with the Tillman family.
Thank you for being here this morning.
You want to believe they're telling you the truth...
...yet, you're getting this sense that you're being lied to.
U.S. Central Command is the point of contact...
...for further inquiries in this investigation. Thank you.
At the end of the briefing, we were told that we would be getting...
...the source documents that were used to support the investigation.
They showed me the box.
It was six binders full of stuff.
"Eventually, Mr. Tillman, you're going to get a copy of all this."
I said,
"Great. When am I gonna get it?"
What motivates you the most?
I don't know.
I get a lot of satisfaction out of, like...
...you know, my family being proud of me.
My brothers, you know, I care what they think and how they feel...
...and I want them to be proud of what I'm doing.
My mom-- My mom finished dead last in the San Francisco Marathon.
I don't know when it was. She was probably 30-- Whatever years old.
I mean, dead last.
On the little sheet when--
You know, they do it-- Her--
Mary Tillman, the last fricking name.
They were actually tearing everything down when she finished, you know.
They were putting everything away.
So, I mean, that says a lot about her.
She's a real hard-working woman--
Dannie committed herself to trying to...
...you know, figure out exactly what happened to our son.
She contacted a lot of people.
She did a lot of work.
I'd take things to work, or I'd make phone calls...
...when I didn't have students, or when I had my break or at lunch.
I'd call the medical examiner, the coroner.
I'd call ballistic people trying to find someone that could answer questions.
I mean,
I was just making calls all the time.
Along the way, I'd encounter people that were able to help us.
And at somewhere along the line, we got in touch with Stan Goff.
I was running a blog, everybody got a blog nowadays...
...so I wrote something about the Tillman Case.
It was just, you know, a commentary piece related to...
...this whole perception-management aspect of the war.
So when we got to talking, she realized I'd been around.
I'd been to Vietnam and Guatemala...
...Grenada, El Salvador, Peru,
Colombia, Somalia.
Three assignments with Ranger units...
...two assignments with the Special Forces unit...
...one assignment with the Counterterrorist unit.
So it wasn't just that I had experience in Pat's unit...
...it was also that
I could sort of help them...
...read the hieroglyphics in that Special Operations world.
Because it is a culture.
The first time the family got a sense that we were being lied to...
...was when we started looking at the documents.
They gave her the papers, but what they did was...
...I think, they tried to drown her, you know.
They wanted to give her so much that, you know, no normal human being...
...would dig through all this paperwork and try to make sense out of it.
The Army handed over transcripts of every interview they conducted...
...with Pat's platoon and their commanding officers.
There were also radio-communications logs...
...field-hospital reports, terrain maps, an autopsy...
...and a detailed study of the light conditions that day.
In all, it totaled over 3,000 pages of material on Pat's death.
But it's redacted.
Every single name, half the actions, any references to places.
You have to go this sort of painstaking reconstruction.
It's like doing a very difficult crossword puzzle.
You keep running around looking for just one word you can fit in there...
...and then you can sort of lock all the other stuff into it.
We tried to look at what was being said...
...and then we'd try to piece together--
Okay, if they're saying this, then who might that be?
We would take a redacted name...
...and we'd try to count the number of spaces that were in there...
...to try to figure out whose last name was in there.
And, of course, by going over the same thing again and again...
...with some names plugged in...
...we started to become familiar with aspects of it.
I wanna make this very clear, when we initially heard of this fratricide...
...and the fact that these soldiers in this vehicle had killed Pat...
...we felt very bad for them, to have to live with this.
We thought it was just some horrible accident.
You know, they were in a fog of war and they were frightened...
...and it was too dark to see. But you're reading things in the documents...
...that make you very suspicious.
The more that we heard about the situation...
...it seemed much more like gross negligence.
They asked one of the soldiers:
"Did you positively identify your target?"
He said, "I don't know.
I thought everybody else did.
I just wanted to be in a firefight."
That doesn't sound like someone who's afraid.
That sounds like someone who simply wants to shoot at something.
There's a sense that we can't discover meaning...
...we can't discover who we are, we have no real sense of identity...
...until that's tested somehow.
Let's test it against something that's real, let's test it in a context...
...where life and death are real coexisting possibilities.
All young infantrymen will say,
"I wanna be in a firefight."
That's what makes them feel like they're fully fledged.
You know, they can say, "Well,
I've actually experienced combat."
What is up?
What's up?
I went in for all the selfish reasons.
I didn't go in because I was patriotic and wanted to serve my country.
I wanted to serve myself.
I wanted to get some money for college.
I wanted to learn to be more self-sufficient.
I wanted to blow things up and shoot guns, you know.
I got to Ranger battalion
September 10th.
And, literally, when I got there and woke up the next morning...
...I got thrown out of my bed and I thought it was a joke.
You know, new guy, big joke.
And when I saw the planes hit the towers...
...you know, during breakfast, it was like:
"I'm gonna fucking die."
It was about 10 minutes later, there was people yelling and standing up.
They were pumped because we was gonna go to war.
They knew we was gonna go to war at that point.
Sound off.
You don't wanna see it happen, but at the same time...
...that's what you've been working for.
And whenever that comes down, you want a chance to say:
"Hey, I can handle this"
Airborne Rangers, motherfucker!
Go!
You know, we're supposed to believe that soldiers' motives are pure...
...that they go into these situations reluctantly.
It's an imposition of a level of wisdom and maturity on soldiers...
...that doesn't apply to 19 year olds anywhere, ever.
I ain't fucking out, dude.
A 19-year-old kid is far less interested in displaying wisdom...
...than they are in, like, giving some sort of a practical demonstration...
...of their masculinity, you know what I mean?
The atmosphere in a military unit like that, is a locker-room atmosphere.
Tapping.
Fucker.
It's not philosophical.
- I turn my back on you.
- Get that fucking camera out of here.
I expected Pat to be kind of like, you know, in a general sense...
...the general depiction of, like, your jock, your meathead.
Not very intelligent.
Kind of like the guys I knew in high school. They were just...
...jerks.
Arrogant, you know, full of himself.
Why the hell is somebody leaving an NFL contract...
...to come to this shit hole and deal with this kind of nonsense?
There was just kind of a low mumble...
...that he really was looking to become a political leader.
A lot of people thought he just didn't have a good head on his shoulders.
He wanted to kind of do the macho, red-blooded American, patriotic thing.
He was an ex-football player, he was used to getting millions of dollars...
...and he was used to pretty much having it his way.
He was a private...
...which in Ranger mentality, it means that you're on the same level as dirt.
There was a time where I did have to take corrective action against Pat...
...for, basically, coming unglued on me for an order that he was given.
That's just the way that the military goes.
You get orders, sometimes you don't like them.
You don't have the option of saying:
"I don't like this.
Let's do this another way."
Or in his case, saying,
"This is completely fucking stupid."
Pat had something, you know, that I wanted.
You know, there was something that Pat knew and just got...
...that I needed, that I wanted.
I went in looking for that one thing that I couldn't put my finger on...
...that was going to help me to accomplish everything I wanted to do...
...and Pat had that something.
He wasn't at all what I expected to find.
He didn't seem like this tough knucklehead guy.
You know, he was interested in Emerson, in Chomsky...
...and he just seemed very, just, open.
It didn't matter who you were, where you were from, what you were into...
...Pat always wanted to find out what you were about.
And he would ask a million questions.
I walked in on him one time and he was reading the Book of Mormon.
And, you know, it really hit me because I am Mormon.
So I asked him, "Hey, you know, you have any questions...
...please feel free to ask.
I'll explain whatever I can to you as best as I can.
I knew that he wasn't religious, but he told me that he respected all religions.
Bryan O'Neal was kind of a small guy, a very nervous guy.
I wasn't real impressed.
I think he was really looking for a place to fit in...
...looking for more family...
...looking for something that was a little bit of a closer tie.
I was kind of terrified going there because, you know...
...the rumors of hazing and tricks that the senior guys play on the new guys.
Pat was different from everyone else in the platoon.
He didn't ever, you know, treat me like I was lower than him.
I think the only time, you know, that I upset Pat...
...is he asked me to, you know, prep some ChemLights...
...for an objective we had the next day...
...and I forgot, you know, I was doing other things.
And he basically let me know that I disappointed him...
...that I didn't do what he wanted me to do.
And that really, you know--
I wish he would've taken me in the hallway...
...and smoked me up and down, and, you know, treated me horribly...
...you know, called me stupid.
But him telling me that I disappointed him, it really upset me, you know.
I decided
I was never gonna do that again...
...because he was such a great guy
I didn't wanna let him down.
When Bryan came in,
Pat kind of picked him up.
He just put an arm around him and scooped him up the best he could.
Everyone was actually envious that he was my team leader...
...that little scrawny me would be working with this huge football player.
I blamed myself for quite some time that maybe...
...you know, Pat's not in a place where he should be...
...because I didn't put forth more effort.
And, you know, it's something
I still think about today.
You know, that because of my lack of faith...
...you know, he may be suffering for it.
For all those who are here tonight...
...we honor the memory and accomplishments of Pat Tillman...
...by permanently retiring his number 42 ASU football jersey.
Arizona was always very good to Pat...
...but it's very hard when you're put out there kind of on display.
The public grieving is not something that I can do.
I don't wanna do it.
It's an awkward spot.
The issue at the time was trying to figure out what had happened to Pat.
It was, you know, sort of a difficult situation...
...because it was a very private thing that happened...
...that was then being played out in the public.
And so I had this sense of sort of wanting to hold on to what I could.
Even at that point, he was totally getting lost.
Pat, who he was as a person, was lost in the conversation.
--what you did with Pat Tillman--
Oh, there we go, typical Republican personal attack.
- Can't stick to the issues--
- Let me finish the point.
Pat Tillman was a Noam Chomsky fan...
...was gonna vote for John Kerry, was against the war in Iraq.
- I don't believe it.
- I don't believe it either.
He signed up because of his desire to fight.
They would take parts of who he was...
...and magnify those to suit their purposes.
I was trying to figure out how to live without him.
You feel like your world has stopped...
...and yet, everything goes on like normal.
It started pretty much overnight after Pat was killed.
The day after he was killed, there were cameras on my front lawn...
...which was bizarre.
I mean, I was not expecting anything like that at all.
He lived here in University Place with his wife.
I remember my mom was always going around closing the blinds.
Today three men from Fort Lewis walk slowly to the house...
...to tell his wife, Marie, they care.
Staff Sergeant David High, a Ranger, tried unsuccessfully...
...to express his feelings, choked up, and walked away.
No, that's not good. Sorry.
But the newsmen camped out on Marie's lawn had the story wrong.
In fact, the casualty-assistance officers were there to compel Marie...
...to sign off on a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery...
...with full military honors.
They were sort of pushing for a military funeral...
...which was not what his wishes were.
During basic training,
Pat had a premonition...
...that if he died, he might be used as a public-relations' stunt.
So he'd smuggled a copy of his final wishes home to Marie.
I really had to kind of push back on them.
They were proceeding as if this was the way things were gonna happen.
Probably thinking that, you know, I was so grief-stricken...
...that I would just go along with it.
My mission here is to support the family...
...and help them through the process, and make it easier for her.
That's the first episode, in a way.
Before Pat's body is even cold.
The death didn't just belong to the family.
This was bigger than the family.
"This is ours," you know.
It's ours to interpret.
And you will see him again when a loving God reunites us all...
...with the loved ones who preceded us in death.
The contrast of the memorial service...
...should have hit a warning shot to the military.
You got people out there speaking in these glittering generalities.
Pat, your family doesn't have to worry anymore.
You are home, you are safe, and you will not be forgotten.
And then you've got his brother coming up there.
Somebody who's willing to speak the brutality of that reality for them.
He was always giving gifts.
Thanks, Pat.
I didn't write shit because I'm not a writer.
And I just want to say, it was--
There's a lot of people here, thanks.
It was really amazing to be his little baby brother.
Yeah, I'm not just gonna sit up here and break down on you, but....
Thank you for coming.
Pat's a fucking champion...
...and always will be.
Just make no mistake, he'd want me to say this.
He's not with God, he's fucking dead.
He's not religious, so....
Thanks for your thoughts, but he's fucking dead.
I don't regret any of that.
You know, as far as what I was thinking...
...I was just simply miserable, you know.
I was, you know--
I was sad for my whole my family.
I was sad for my mom, my dad,
Marie, Kevin.
This isn't a production.
It's my brother's service.
I didn't plan on saying that, it just....
He's not what these people wished he was.
Everyone grabbed at Pat's death.
Not necessarily just the military, everybody grabbed at him.
They just chose the wrong family to try to do it in front of.
Not to say that we always did the right thing in this house...
...we made lots of mistakes...
...but I think that we did make an attempt to tell the truth.
You know, sometimes you have to work at that.
In 1976, Patrick and Dannie Tillman moved to New Almaden...
...a two-road town near San Jose, California...
...where he practiced law and she worked as a teacher.
Part of the reason for living out in New Almaden...
...was a deliberate decision...
...to set a better environment for the kids.
We discouraged watching TV.
We did the same thing with the telephone.
We had one telephone and it was right in the middle of the house.
If you wanted to talk to somebody...
...then you'd talk right in front of everybody else.
So it wasn't like we isolated them, it's just there were certain priorities...
...and it wasn't that difficult to deprive them for their own good.
You know, we did grow up together.
Pat and Kevin were so close in age...
...they were only 14 months apart, so they were together all the time.
They would go to the creek, the mountains.
I was exhausted by 7 because they were all over the place...
...and I just didn't have that kind of stamina.
It was just our own little world.
And we happened to have a very just and kind leader in Pat.
And it pushed Kevin and myself to do things...
...that, you know, we probably wouldn't have normally done.
The boys had that colorful language.
It just was the way they talked.
Well, the F-word is one of their more popular words...
...and they can use it as an adjective, a verb, a noun.
They can, you know-- And then other parts of speech that we don't know.
Yeah, that's true.
They kind of-- They swear a lot.
Did you have rules in the house about cussing?
Evidently not.
I never met Pat, so the only way that I know Pat Tillman...
...is through what I've heard from his family.
Pat was a pretty typical kid, but then he also had this gift.
You know, he had this gift.
He was a comparatively little guy that could just really run fast...
...and knock the shit out of people.
We first noticed Pat Tillman when he scored the game-winning touchdown...
...against Independence last season, then did a flip in full pads.
Made it up, I don't know.
Came to me right about the time
I did it. I don't know.
He was very low-key about getting the compliments and the accolades.
It kind of embarrassed him.
You're always so modest when I talk to you.
This time, take some credit for yourself.
You're not gonna do it, are you?
I had a big line and a great offensive coordinator.
I don't know where he is, but well-coached.
He wasn't much of a showman.
- Give him the plaque.
- Here you go.
He enjoyed the game. He enjoyed all the games that he played.
He liked climbing things.
He liked jumping off of things.
He liked taking risks, yeah.
Yeah, he was big on risks.
He challenged himself that way.
He wouldn't let me see any of that.
If you're gonna do that kind of stuff, do it behind my back.
Pat was given a football scholarship to Arizona State University...
...where he became an academic All-American...
...with a 3.8 grade point average.
We never lose at home.
We kicked the shit out of them.
His square-jawed intensity and long-haired California cool...
...soon made him a local celebrity.
I want you to talk about Patton...
...military leaders that you kind of tap into...
...for your own,
I guess, abilities on a football field.
You know, Patton's a cool guy.
I like his stuff.
He made some comment one time, something to the effect of:
"No one ever won a war dying for their country.
Let the other son of a bitch die for his."
It's things like that, it's guys like that, guys where their attitude--
They're a little bit crazy...
...but it's that craziness that propels them to greatness.
The throw. Shoots it over the middle.
And, whoa, what a hit.
Pat Tillman knocked the helmet off of Isaac Byrd.
- That was scary.
- Oh, my.
Because he was considered small, at 5'11"...
...Pat was never expected to make it in NFL.
But from his very first training camp, he set the tone for his career.
I mean, they are gonna be fights in training camp.
I got Pitt and Pat Tillman together.
Those two are important to me.
There was no problem.
You know, 9:00 in the morning, get your ass knocked off...
...I might be mad too.
He would hit you as hard as he possibly could.
Never even looked at Pat Tillman.
Never even thought--
That's a perfect job for Pat Tillman because he's a little bit free of spirit.
To his new teammates,
Pat was a bit of an oddball.
He didn't own a cell phone or a car...
...and would leave his beach cruiser in the team parking lot...
...among the Escalades and BMWs.
But to fans, Pat was a rare example of a public figure...
...who wasn't afraid to speak his mind.
Why should the fans think this year's gonna be any different?
You know what? They shouldn't.
We haven't done anything at this point to prove that we're not--
We didn't have a good year last year, and that's the only thing that matters.
We need to go out and start winning games.
When we start winning games, the fans will come out and watch us.
Until that happens, you know,
I wouldn't come out either.
The Cardinals win and they go to the playoffs.
He liked the physicality of it, but I think he really liked that feeling...
...of being connected with the man next to you.
I think he thrived on that feeling of unity.
At the age of 25, four years into his NFL career...
...Pat married his high-school sweetheart.
This is very special for me.
It means a lot that my older brother is getting married--
Pat first crossed paths with Marie Ugenti at the age of 4...
...when they played in the same youth soccer league.
She was his first and only girlfriend.
And even though they would go to different colleges...
...and he would become a high-profile athlete...
...Pat remained faithful to Marie until the end of his life.
As far as an older brother, you couldn't ask for anything more than him.
I mean, he's lights out, he's fantastic.
And to know that he's with Marie...
...the greatest girl in the whole world, it's just money, man.
It's absolutely money for me.
I don't know, I love it, dude.
This is fucking awesome.
To see Pat and Marie get married--
It was just an awesome day.
I didn't realize that--
You know, what was known at that point, obviously.
But it was....
I'm glad I didn't. I don't think I would have had as much fun, that's for sure.
They made this decision, the three of them...
...Kevin and Pat and Marie.
It was something they talked about.
They kept it from us until after
Pat and Marie were actually married.
The boys, they called me on, actually, Mother's Day of 2002...
...and they told me that they were going to enlist.
And Dannie was not happy about the whole thing.
She made it known.
Members of the family go back for generations serving.
My father, my father-in-law...
...all my uncles, served in World War II or Korea.
And, you know,
I talked to the boys a lot...
...about, you know, the camaraderie of war.
And I suppose it concerned me that I did talk too much about that.
That it became more intriguing to them than it should've been.
Some people thought that, you know,
I could have talked him out of it...
...or asked him not to do it.
But that was just never something
I would've done.
Somehow or another, Dannie had a lot more foresight than I did...
...because it dawned on her right then and there...
...that she cannot deal with losing one of her sons.
My comment at the time was:
"Could you imagine someone seeing
Pat and Kevin coming after them?
I feel bad for those people."
So that was a bad call on my part.
We'll never know exactly why Pat Tillman enlisted.
He made a deliberate choice not to make it a public matter.
But after he died, an interview surfaced.
Even as athletes, we bitch and moan every now and again...
...about this or that, and if we ever just, you know--
Times like this, you stop and think about just how--
Not only how good we have it, but what kind of a system we live under...
...what freedoms we're allowed, and that wasn't built overnight.
And it's kind of--
The flag is a symbol of all that, the symbol of--
You know, you just don't think about it--
On the day after 9/11, the Cardinals had conducted team interviews...
...so players could comment on the country...
...in the wake of the terrorist attacks.
My great-grandfather was at Pearl Harbor...
...and a lot of my family has given up--
Has gone and fought in wars.
And I really haven't done a damn thing...
...as far as laying myself on the line like that.
So I have a great deal of respect for those that have.
And what the flag stands for.
The interview became known as Pat's explanation...
...for why he dropped everything and joined the Army...
...even though he wouldn't actually make his decision...
...for another six months.
It would be used to violate his only request...
...that his motivation for enlisting be kept private.
Pat Tillman had everything to live for.
All that was missing was a true sense of purpose.
He said he found that on September 11th, 2001.
Former safety for the Arizona Cardinals...
...gave up a multimillion-dollar pro-football deal...
...the day after September 11th.
Tillman explained his decision--
This is what he said the day after the attacks--
Here's how he explained his decision--
"To make right," he said,
"what 9/11 had made so wrong."
He was a human being...
...and by putting this kind of heroic, saintly quality to him...
...you're taking away the struggle of being a human being.
I mean, he had to make choices, just like we all do.
And he tried to make the right choices.
When he didn't make the right choice, he was the first person to tell you.
The military was not what Pat expected it to be.
He thought, just like the majority of people in this country...
...that going into Afghanistan was the right thing to do.
And then, of course, once they enlisted...
...the talks started veering towards going into Iraq.
And when they were over there, he didn't like what he saw.
In February 2003,
Pat and Kevin were deployed to Iraq.
One month later, the Rangers were ordered...
...to provide perimeter support for the rescue of Jessica Lynch...
...a supply clerk who had reportedly engaged the enemy...
...in a fierce firefight before being taken prisoner.
She showed true courage.
She shot until she ran out of ammunition.
She's alive, she's being tortured.
Despite the apparent urgency...
...the rescue of Jessica Lynch was inexplicably put on hold.
Russell Baer waited out the delay on top of a bunker...
...with Pat and his brother Kevin.
Just watching these bombs and these A-10's strafe the city.
That was the first time I'd heard Pat in kind of like no-kidding opinion...
...on kind of what was going on there.
He just said,
"This war is just so fucking illegal."
You know, just watching this scene unfold...
...you know, the city's being blown to shit.
Come right, come right.
Okay.
I'm moving to cover our backs.
- Okay.
- This is oppressive.
Hold it there, please.
It's pretty clear the Special Ops team could have essentially...
...walked into the hospital, picked her up and carried her out...
...and would've been cooperated with all along the way.
It would come out later that Jessica Lynch...
...had neither fired her weapon nor been tortured...
...and that the inexplicable delay...
...had been to enable a combat camera crew to record the mission.
- Camera right here?
- Can you smile?
- Can you smile for the family?
- For your folks?
There you go. You're doing great,
Jessica. You're doing wonderful.
It was a film production.
Jessica Lynch's rescue was a film production.
We understand that there is video taken by a combat camera team.
- Can you show us that video?
- Do we have the tape?
Some brave souls put their lives on the line to make this happen.
Loyal to the creed that they know...
...that they'll never leave a fallen comrade...
...and never embarrass their country.
With that, I'll take your questions.
The media has been more than complicit.
The military has just released new video this morning of the daring raid.
They wanna take all the complexities of a real situation...
...and reduce them into a comfortable fable.
It was a mission one described as "a midnight ballet."
One that's easy to sort of digest...
...and, you know, consists of good guys and bad guys...
...that are clearly recognizable from movies.
Saving Private Lynch.
Private First Class Jessica Lang, a 19-year-old U.S. Army soldier.
I apologize. It's Jessica "Lynch."
If you wanna get the public to cosign something...
...you gotta give them something that they're willing to cosign.
It has to be turned into a morality play.
- American hero.
- American hero.
I do not wanna see dead bodies.
I do not wanna see coffins.
I wanna remain comfortable.
Welcome home.
And so, you know, the government gives them what they want.
The press gives them what they want.
Pat and Kevin, when they came back from Iraq...
...were like,
"This is just 100 percent bullshit."
I think after coming home from Iraq, he was a little disillusioned.
It was right around the halfway mark...
...and he was in a stage of looking towards the next step.
Just before Pat was due to return to combat duty...
...an opportunity arose that would have saved his life.
One of the NFL teams had approached his agent...
...and, you know, said that he would be eligible to get out...
...since he had been on a combat tour.
In a back-channel agreement...
...the military said that Pat could be immediately discharged with honors...
...and could return to his football career by the following season.
As coach Dave McGinnis later recalled...
...Pat sought him out to discuss the secret offer.
When he came in and talked to me--
We talked for about two hours in my office.
And we talked about some things that at the time...
...that he asked that I not talk about.
He said, "Coach Mac, I'll tell you some things, but I would prefer--"
And believe me,
I will hold those things forever.
Just know this, that Pat Tillman made a decision...
...based on some very real values.
And the words: honor, integrity, dignity, commitment...
...they were not just adjectives with Pat Tillman...
...they were realities in his life...
...and that came through very loud and clear.
He committed for three years and he was gonna fulfill his commitment.
It's the same reason why Kevin didn't leave after Pat was killed.
They made a commitment and they honored that.
Did you get the impression that he planned on returning to football?
Just give me a minute here because this is....
You know, he had....
That's what he wanted to do...
...because one of the last things that he said to me when we left up there--
You know, I said, "Okay, good luck.
Stay in touch, we'll be--"
And he said, "You know, I'd...."
And then-- And his last--
He said, "Coach, I just-- You know,
I wanna come back and play for you."
Pat reported for his second tour of duty in April of 2004.
His platoon was sent to Afghanistan and assigned to carry out...
...reconnaissance sweeps near the Pakistani border.
The Rangers were accompanied by a group of allied Afghan militia...
...known as AMF soldiers.
Pat was now in charge of a small fire team including Bryan O'Neal.
At that time,
I mean, I was still brand-new.
Being from Arizona...
...I thought a lot of Afghanistan looked like a lot of Arizona.
The people were a bit different.
These photos were taken by Pat's platoon...
...in the days leading up to the incident of April 22nd.
On that day, while traversing the rugged terrain...
...one of the platoon's Humvees broke down.
After six hours stuck in a small village, the commanders back at base...
...ordered the platoon split in two halves, or "serials."
One serial was to deal with the downed vehicle...
...while the other, including Pat,
Russell Baer and Bryan O'Neal...
...was to carry on with the mission.
I remember thinking that it was a horrible idea to split the convoy.
You know, you're taking half of your firepower away...
...especially in this area we were going through.
As soon as we took off, we basically went into this canyon...
...where the walls were so steep.
442 Zulu.
We're running down the canyon.
Staff Sergeant **** is going to narrate as best he can...
...his recollection of events passing through this canyon.
This video shows the actual canyon where Pat was killed.
It was presented to the Tillman's...
...as part of the military's official explanation of the incident.
Okay, we're rolling.
This is April 23rd, 2006. 0551 Zulu.
The Army's investigator returned to Afghanistan...
...with members of Pat's platoon...
...who walked him through the sequence of events...
...and laid out the routes of the two serials.
Traveling along a dry creek bed at the bottom of a narrow gorge...
...Pat, Bryan O'Neal, Russell Baer, and the rest of Serial 1...
...made it through the canyon unscathed.
At the mouth of the canyon, they arrived at a small village.
There was a rolling hill with some compounds on it.
My squad leader said, "Stop the vehicles. Get out, stretch your legs.
Let's figure out where we're at.
Let's figure out where Serial 2's at."
And that's when we heard the first initial explosion.
I remember hearing these explosions go off...
...and I knew they were in the back of the canyon where we just were.
Which kind of surprised me because, you know, I didn't realize...
...that the second half of the convoy was following behind us like they were.
In the steep terrain...
...the two serials had lost radio contact with each other.
Pat's serial didn't know...
...that half a mile behind them in the canyon, was the second serial.
In the last of five vehicles was
Kevin Tillman and Jason Parsons.
We was moving through the canyon and then there was an explosion.
I mean, it was a pretty decent explosion.
We seen rocks and dust and everything fly.
People in a vehicle further up the canyon...
...believed that it was an RPG attack...
...so they began lighting up that position.
The Army initially reported that the Rangers were set upon...
...by an ambush of up to 20 Taliban fighters.
But in the entire course of this attack...
...not a single Ranger was wounded by enemy fire.
Not even a bullet hole was found in any of the equipment.
Even though you go through all the statements, no one ever saw...
...more than two people at a time that were attacking them.
And in many cases, they sounded very unsure of themselves...
...even saying that.
It's completely conceivable...
...that these explosions were maybe one of our guys AD'd his weapon.
AD meaning they discharged the weapon accidentally.
That's his perspective.
I'll let him have it.
But from my perspective, there was two mortars that hit...
...there were rounds coming in...
...I had one impact 6 to 7 feet away from me.
In the end, the existence of any enemy combatants...
...has been disputed.
What has never been disputed is that, in this moment...
...the Rangers in Serial 2 unleashed their full firepower...
...up into the canyon walls...
...as they continued driving towards Serial 1.
It was not a fog of war, not in my mind at all.
I believe it was a lust to fight.
I don't think these soldiers were scared when they came out of that canyon.
I think they were relieved they were out of the canyon...
...and they just wanted to shoot.
Hearing the explosion and gun fire...
...Serial 1 ran back toward the canyon to help Serial 2.
I remember seeing Pat, you know.
He yelled at me, "O'Neal, follow me!"
And, you know, I do what I was told.
You know, he's my team leader,
I follow him wherever I go.
And I was really surprised at how quick O'Neal was following Pat.
I mean, he has just as much gear on as everybody else...
...and he was just keeping up with him.
I remember getting halfway up this hill and Pat turning around...
...asking Sergeant Weeks, my squad leader:
"Hey, Sergeant Weeks, can we take our body armor off?"
And I remember thinking to myself:
"Fuck that.
I am keeping my body armor on."
Pat is wanting to get up there as quickly as possible.
Tillman was at about this location...
...and he asked if he could drop his body armor...
...and start pursuing up this hill.
I told him no.
At that time, I noticed there was an Afghani militia man with us.
He jumped in with us and we just started running.
At the moment Pat's fire team reached these rocks...
...the lead vehicle of Serial 2 emerged from the canyon below them.
The vehicle had left Kevin, Jason and the rest of the convoy behind.
It pulled into the clearing, and the soldiers onboard took aim...
...directly up at Pat's fire team.
The AMF soldier standing next to Pat...
...was shot eight times in the chest and dropped dead.
Facing the gentleman, and I approached--
People started to yell, "Cease fire!"
Then people said, "Hey, I think they're fucking shooting at us."
And then, you know, we knew, no shit, that they were shooting at us.
A .50 cal can shoot
900 rounds a minute...
...and it could have been no less than a minute that they were shooting at us.
You could see on the rock all the marks from the rounds...
...all except the spot where I was lying.
I just remember thinking,
"I'm gonna die."
And, you know, asking Pat,
"What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna get out of this?"
And he said, "I've got an idea."
He popped a smoke grenade and threw it...
...and they stopped shooting at us.
And after they stopped shooting at us, you know, me and Pat stood up...
...let our hearts slow down for a second.
I remember looking at Pat asking him,
"How could that happen?
How did they not see us?"
And, you know, he couldn't answer me, he didn't know.
I was actually more afraid for the guys that had just got done shooting at us...
...that they were gonna get in trouble.
The soldiers didn't get in trouble...
...because the military always maintained...
...that what happened next transpired in only four seconds...
...during the confusion of combat.
For years, we get this story...
...that Pat was shot from probably 200, 300 yards away.
They were going about 25 to 35 miles an hour...
...firing wildly to the right...
...and Pat and this Afghan were just an unfortunate consequence...
...of people being excited.
But Bryan O'Neal has said, in no uncertain terms that...
...that was not the case.
Today was the first day I've ever actually seen this PowerPoint.
It's really interesting to see from this perspective now.
I don't find this video accurate because it depicts, on his account...
...that they were moving continuously...
...through the valley where they were driving.
In actuality, from my memory...
...I remember them stopping and firing on two occasions.
What he's saying here is a complete lie.
The driver took them from about a hundred yards away...
...over to a better location to kill them.
Now they're about 40 yards away.
You know, they stopped and then drove forward...
...and then reengaged us, dismounted...
...and then started reengaging us again.
At that point,
I thought we were all gonna die.
And....
I remember putting my weapon on fire, and having my finger on the trigger...
...and knowing these are my buddies down there...
...but knowing that they're gonna kill us and kill everybody.
And I was, you know, a second away from just loading them up...
...just killing them all, and I could have done it.
I started to say a prayer out loud, you know, and it was something like:
"Oh, God, please, if you can help us out of this situation...
...you know, I'll be very grateful...
...and I'll do what I can to repay you for this debt that I will owe you."
And I remember Pat saying,
"O'Neal, quit praying."
You know,
God is not the one to help you now.
This is reality, this is what we need to focus on.
I don't want you to go into some la-la land...
...not pay attention and then get killed."
I was actually grateful for him to say that.
I was really trying to put my focus somewhere else and not keep it here.
Pat, he saved my life.
All of the sudden, they started shooting at us again...
...and I just remember Pat, you know, yelling his name.
"I'm Pat Tillman.
I'm Pat fucking Tillman, why are you shooting at me?"
Pat's last words were, repeatedly,
"I'm Pat fucking Tillman."
And that was after he got lit up by the machine gun the first time.
He's flat on the ground, sitting on the ground, he was hurt.
And I suspect he was a bit disappointed...
...that his own team is shooting at him.
And I imagine that those comments of his, "I'm Pat fucking Tillman"...
...he said while looking right at them...
...with a face that would make most people nervous.
I remember hearing the sound of a drinking fountain.
Like, when you press the button...
...to get water out of the drinking fountain, the sound it makes.
And I just look over at my side and I see this blood...
...pouring down this rock that I'm sitting behind.
He-- His head was gone.
Completely gone.
And I take my helmet off and I throw it against the ground...
...and then I kind of blackout.
I just heard this guttural scream.
And I automatically thought,
"Someone's dead."
It's the first thing I had.
And I caught Dannie about seven, eight feet outside her door...
...and she was collapsing, and I caught her...
...and she had a telephone in her hand.
One sad thing, and I'll never forget this...
...but she went and got a picture of Patrick...
...and she had this picture and she just kept saying:
"April the 22nd, 2004.
April the 22nd, Pat is gone.
April the 22nd--"
I was with Kevin when he found out
Pat had been killed.
He got out of the vehicle...
...and you could see there was a million things going through his head.
There was absolute horror and shock...
...and I remember him screaming several times.
I remember him taking his helmet off and slamming it on the ground.
I remember...
...our medic, Doc...
...kind of coming up to him, you know, saying, "Hey, give me your weapon."
And then I saw him go over to his brother's body and he just sat there.
I remember seeing Kevin in his Humvee...
...and I was told by Colonel Bailey...
...to not tell him
Pat was killed by friendly fire.
You know,
"Your career is on the line...
...do not tell Kevin exactly what happened."
Kevin had arrived on the scene
10 minutes after the shooting.
He was immediately quarantined and the rest of the platoon...
...was ordered not to tell him what had happened.
Russell Baer was put on a plane with Kevin.
He was ordered to escort Pat's remains back home...
...and to present the family with flags on behalf of the country.
That was a difficult experience for me.
Just with everything that I knew...
...and I was scared about what was to come afterwards.
You know, I was just--
I was afraid for it all.
I mean, it was the first time
I'd ever met Pat's mom...
...and she saw how difficult it was for me and she....
She grabbed my hand, kind of just patted my hand a little bit.
The real test of a man is not when he plays the role he wants for himself...
...but when he plays the role destiny has for him.
So when that little voice in your head tells you not to do the easy things...
...but the right things...
...it's Pat. Right in your ear, man.
It's Pat.
Right after Pat died...
...we probably felt the most sense of comfort from people from the military.
And we were very honored to see that General Kensinger was present.
I wanna thank anybody involved in the military...
...especially the Rangers.
Outstanding human beings--
Then to find out that they were the very people to lie to us...
...it's outrageous.
I don't know a lot about what happened to Pat...
...but the last few days have not been very pleasant.
It's only been a week and it ain't getting any better.
It's a horrible thing to lie.
It's an atrocity that they would take a young man with honorable intentions...
...who served his country...
...and lie about how he died to promote a war.
To use him as a political--
A propaganda tool, basically.
That is immoral.
The five shooters never gave a credible explanation for their actions.
But by the time the Tillmans had unredacted...
...the entire box of documents...
...they understood that the deception about their son's death...
...went much higher than the soldiers on the ground.
Pat Tillman has been killed.
Forty-five minutes later, he's been killed by fratricide.
"Oh, shit. What do we do now?"
"Okay, let's spin this as a heroic action.
We'll turn his dead body into a recruiting poster."
They destroyed his uniform, his body armor, his helmet, his diary.
Every piece of evidence that could ever be used...
...to explain what happened is eliminated.
You just don't do shit without telling your superior officer.
"Oh, I'm gonna go burn Pat's uniform."
No.
You don't piss without permission...
...so this goes pretty damn high.
Once the Tillmans shifted their focus...
...to the higher-ups responsible for the cover-up...
...the lead investigator assigned to their case...
...began publicly suggesting that it was time to move on.
I don't know. These people, they have a hard time letting it go.
It may be because of their religious beliefs.
- I don't know how an atheist thinks.
- Right.
But I can only imagine that, that would be pretty tough.
Right.
If you're an atheist, then you don't believe in anything?
If you die, what is there to go to?
Nothing. You're worm dirt.
It's pretty hard to get your head around that.
So you suspect that's the reason why this thing's dragging on.
I think so. There's not a whole lot of trust in the system.
- Right.
- Or faith in the system.
It was my understanding at the time that this investigation is over...
...that this has been closed...
...they're not gonna give me the truth, it's a done deal.
And that being said, there's not much
I can do to force the issue.
So I wrote them a letter.
I just went through and blew out...
...just about everything they considered to be a fact.
And explained to them why that is a lie...
...and concluded by telling them that I have low regard for them.
I just wanted to tell somebody off.
Unbeknownst to Pat Sr., the Army considered the wording of his letter...
...to be a formal accusation of criminal misconduct.
This automatically initiated a new investigation...
...by the inspector general's office.
Thank you for being here today.
It's kind of obnoxious that the letter did have the impact that it did.
It's like, wait a minute, my mom has been working her ass off for years...
...and if she knew all she had to do was tell you to go fuck yourself...
...and you'd actually do your job,
I'm sure she would have done that...
...two and a half years before.
After an 18-month inquiry, the Army secretary announced...
...that the military was finally ready to assign blame.
We present to you the results of the Wallace Investigation...
...into the tragic death of Corporal Pat Tillman.
I'm on my way to an anniversary in Las Vegas.
I get a phone call from my wife that says, "Hey, you're on CNN."
Up first, new information about who bungled the initial probe...
...into the friendly-fire death...
...of Army Ranger and former football star Pat Tillman.
Let's go to the news conference now over at the Pentagon. Let's listen in.
General Wallace did find a senior official...
...Lieutenant General Kensinger, the senior leader in...
...the administrative chain of command for the 75th Ranger Regiment...
...found him guilty of deception.
General Kensinger was the captain of that ship and his ship ran aground.
It ran aground because he failed--
Devastating. Devastating to be called the villain in the process...
...or the captain who ran his ship aground...
...and let all his soldiers down.
General Kensinger was the public face of the Army...
...in the weeks after Pat's death.
I will not be taking questions.
The Army said that Kensinger knew about the fratricide...
...when he attended
Pat's memorial service.
He would be stripped of his third star.
But as a reporter noted...
...there may have be another reason why Kensinger took the fall.
--yet, all the blame falls on General Kensinger.
I'm just trying to make sense of that.
He happens to be retired, is there a coincidence there?
The fact that he--
He's the only one who's really being singled out.
I believe the buck stops with Kensinger.
He was the senior leader in the chain of command for--
I don't think the buck stops at Kensinger.
There's no way this cover-up started at the three-star level. It had to go higher.
You look at what Kensinger's role--
I don't think Kensinger would have been inclined to cover it up...
...if he wasn't ordered to.
--if he performed his duty--
I mean, he was culpable.
I mean, he could've easily picked up the phone and called us...
...you know, but this is their life, this is their career...
...and they're terrified of losing what they've worked so hard for.
My wife says
I'm too much of a soldier.
I've been doing it, you know, since 17.
When somebody tells me something, tells me to go do something, you say--
In the Army, you salute and, you know, about-face, and go get it done.
To think that, you know, this is how, you know, you get treated.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
With the end of the press conference...
...the Army declared the Tillman matter over.
But two days later, as if in response to this...
...a reporter received an anonymous leak.
It was a copy of a top-secret internal communiqué...
...known as a P4 memo...
...sent just seven days after Pat's death...
...and a full month before the family learned of the fratricide.
After this briefing that we received from the inspector general...
...someone from Associated Press was sent a P4 memo...
...that went out to the highest generals in the land.
Not only did the P4 memo clearly state...
...that Pat was killed by friendly fire, but it left no doubt...
...that the cover-up reached well above General Kensinger's rank.
Thank you, all.
General Stanley McChrystal had sent the P4 memo on April 29th...
...after White House speechwriters had requested details...
...about Pat's death from the Pentagon.
The P4 memo states they must warn the president about this...
...because they'll be giving speeches and they shouldn't be embarrassed...
...if the circumstances of Pat's death become public.
He set aside a career in athletics--
The warning seemed to work.
In a speech, given two days before the memorial...
...the president avoided the very details of Pat's death...
...that his speechwriters had requested.
Friends say that this young man saw the images of September the 11th...
...and seeing that evil, he felt called to defend America.
Our suspicions in the beginning were very much validated by that P4 memo.
These generals had plenty of time...
...to make sure that we, as a family, were told the truth...
...but they chose not to tell us.
The P4 memo clearly showed...
...that while America was being told the valorous account of Pat's death...
...the entire chain of command not only knew it was a lie...
...but were urgently concerned about the implications...
...should the truth get out.
Armed with this new evidence...
...the family was able to take their case above the military...
...and in April 2007, the House of
Representatives convened hearings...
...to investigate whether there had been a cover-up in the Tillman case.
The first testimony given was from the man...
...who had remained silent throughout the ordeal...
...Pat's brother, Kevin Tillman.
Even after discovering that the entire platoon...
...had been lying to him about the fratricide...
...Kevin had insisted on completing the full term of his enlistment.
Once he got out of the Army,
Kevin went into seclusion...
...refusing, until now, to speak publicly about his brother.
My name is Kevin Tillman.
Two days ago marked the third anniversary...
...of the death of my older brother,
Pat Tillman. Spera, Afghanistan.
To our family and friends, it was a devastating loss.
To the nation, it was a moment of disorientation.
To the military, it was a nightmare.
But to others within the government, it appears to have been an opportunity.
A terrible tragedy was transformed into an inspirational message...
...that served instead, to support the nation's foreign-policy wars.
After the truth of Pat's death was partially revealed...
...the Army was now left with the task of briefing our family...
...and answering our questions.
With any luck, our family would sink quietly into our grief...
...and the whole unsavory episode would be swept under the rug.
However, they miscalculated our family's reaction.
Through the amazing strength and perseverance of my mother...
...the most amazing woman on earth...
...our family has managed to have multiple investigations conducted.
However, while each investigation gathered more information...
...the mountain of evidence was never used to arrive at an honest...
...or even sensible conclusion.
That is why we ask Congress...
...as a sovereign representative of the whole people...
...to investigate Pat's death.
Anything less than the truth is a betrayal of those values...
...that all soldiers who have fought for this nation have sought to uphold.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you very much for your testimony.
Ms. Tillman, I know he was speaking for both of you.
Is there anything you want to add?
I would like to say...
...we have been asked, over and over again:
"Well, what can we do for your family?
How can we appease you?"
And it makes me sick.
It's not about our family.
Our family will never be satisfied.
We'll never have Pat back.
But what is so outrageous is this isn't about Pat.
This is about what they did to a nation.
Pat died for this country.
He believed it was a great country that had a system that worked.
It's not perfect, no one has ever said that...
...but to write these glorious tales is really a disservice to Pat...
...and to all the other soldiers.
You're diminishing their true heroism.
It may not be pretty, it may not be like out of a John Wayne movie...
...but that's not what war is all about.
It's ugly, it's bloody, it's painful.
Everyone should understand what's going on.
And we shouldn't have smokescreens thrown in our face.
Thank you.
Pat Tillman was the most famous enlisted man in the military.
Pat Tillman is killed.
It's obvious that it was fratricide.
The idea, the very idea, that anyone in that chain of command...
...would dare keep this information from anyone above them...
...is absolutely inconceivable.
Pat Tillman received a letter congratulating him on his enlistment...
...under the signature of Donald Rumsfeld.
The Secretary of Defense didn't give me a congratulations letter...
...whenever I joined the Army.
Not only did Rumsfeld write a letter to Pat right after he enlisted...
...he also sent a high-priority e-mail to the secretary of the Army...
...saying that this guy is very special, we need to keep an eye on him.
At the urging of the Tillmans, the investigating committee...
...requested testimony from the recipients of the P4 memo...
...as well as Secretary Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers.
We finally were face to face with the highest generals in the land.
You know, the former Secretary of Defense.
And then we also had people that have the power...
...to make these guys accountable.
...to make these guys accountable.
General Abizaid, let me start with you.
When did you receive this memo?
On the 29th, General McChrystal sent his message...
...and it went to my headquarters in Tampa...
...and it was not retransmitted...
...for reasons of difficulties with our systems within the headquarters...
...until the 6that the earliest--
Yeah, yeah.
General Abizaid didn't get the fax...
...and there was a mix-up at the office.
That's a good one.
Probably the 6th. It's a guess.
I can't be sure exactly of the date--
Abizaid is responsible for the entire
Middle East and North Africa...
...and this guy's not gonna be informed?
Well, General Myers, let's turn to you.
The other generals recounted similar stories.
I can't tell you.
I don't know how I knew.
To the best of my knowledge,
I've never seen this P4.
First of all, on the message, on the P4, I was an info addressee...
...which is not the primary addressee--
In the next three hours, the committee would hear...
...some variation of the phrase
"I don't recall," 82 times.
I just don't know.
Incredibly, this urgent warning had somehow slipped through the cracks.
There's an interesting thing about the P4 that says:
"Deliver during normal duty hours."
And so, again--
It was very disappointing.
That's not even the word, we were angry.
All the generals were lying,
They should have been called on a lot of things and they weren't.
I thought this was an oversight committee.
To me, an oversight committee...
...is someone that does a bit of investigation...
...it's not a cheerleading outfit.
I believe this is appropriately handled...
...and those who made errors were held accountable.
Ninety-nine point nine percent of the military do an outstanding job...
...and I thank you for setting an example.
These folks were held accountable.
Is that correct, General Myers?
General? All generals?
From what I understand, that's correct.
You know, a lot of politics is theatrical wrestling, you know...
...which, behind the scenes it's like,
"Okay, let's don't get anybody hurt."
Mr. Secretary, thank you for being with us today.
How and when did you learn that Corporal Tillman had been killed?
I don't recall precisely how I learned that he was killed.
Okay.
Before he did so, were you aware that President Bush...
...was going to reference
Corporal Tillman...
...in a correspondents' dinner speech on May 1st?
No.
It was embarrassing to watch.
I have no recollection of discussing it--
These guys didn't have the ammunition...
...to cross-examine him and catch him in a lie.
Well, let me conclude the hearing by just indicating the facts...
...that General Myers and General
Brown knew at the end of April.
General Abizaid learned on May 6th.
Secretary Rumsfeld learned on May 20th.
Could I correct--?
Sir, could I make a point here?
Who? Yes, Mr. Secretary?
I wanna make sure it's precisely accurate.
I do not believe I testified that I learned on May 20th, and if I--
If that impression's been left,
I don't want that left.
My testimony is that
I just simply do not know...
...when I first learned of the possibility of fratricide.
- I appreciate that correction.
- Thank you.
- And, sir, if I may?
- Yeah.
I also wanted to make sure that the 6this a logical day.
- It's not the day.
- Okay.
It's the best that my staff and I could come to the conclusion--
Well, you were all very busy.
There was no question about it.
Sir, one other thing, if I could interrupt to also correct.
Your statement was that
I knew about the friendly fire.
I knew that there was an investigation ongoing...
...about the potential for friendly fire.
That's goes for me too.
That's exactly right.
- And for me, as well.
- Okay.
At the point that they let Abizaid off the hook...
...that's the point where
Dannie knew...
...you know, that this is as far as it was gonna go.
Thank you, sir.
That concludes our business and the committee hearing is adjourned.
On the way out of the congressional hearing...
...this congressman, he squats down next to me...
...and he holds out his hand to shake my hand...
...and he just wanted to tell me that he's proud of me...
...and he's proud of my son.
I just said, "Get out of here.
Get away from me."
He would not go away, he wanted to keep talking.
I pulled my hand away from him,
I said, "Get out of here, right now.
Get away from me."
Where does this stuff end?
It's been four years.
None of the actors in this matter have been held accountable.
But that's certainly no fault of Dannie's.
Pat would be nothing but unbelievably proud for her, you know.
I mean, she took it as far as she could take it.
She did everything in her power to fight for Pat.
And I mean, she knocked it out of the park.
Unfortunately, the fucking government moved the fence back, and it--
You know, that was it.
It's about all I can do at this point.
We've sort of, you know--
The questioning has sort of run its course.
I guess I held out hope that at the last hour we would get answers...
...but, no, that's not what happened.
I don't think there's much else that can be done.
The be all and the end all...
...is not whether or not
Congress follows through.
Like it or not, there's a public dimension to Pat Tillman...
...and it ain't gonna go away.
That's a dangerous thing to fool around with though.
It's dangerous to lionize people like Pat.
When people who are attracted to the mystique of Pat Tillman...
...begin to actually study who Pat Tillman was...
...they're gonna find out that this story doesn't fit...
...into something that's all tidy and mythic.
The danger of something like this...
...is it's an opportunity for reality to break through.
People start asking questions...
...and then all of the sudden, the Tillman story changes.
I've talked about it with my dad actually, and it was just like:
"It'd be really neat to have a statue of
Pat where he's laughing his ass off."
You wanna make him a myth?
Go ahead and make him a myth, just be accurate with it.
You know, if he could walk on water in these myths...
...then let him have a beer every once in a while...
...and let him hang out with friends and let him be gracious...
...and let him be sensitive and let him be funny...
...and let him be all the things that he was.
When I talk about Pat--
And everybody is sort of on the same page, at least, you know, the family.
That when you talk about Pat, he's sort of like sitting in the room with you.
I mean, and that's such a--
That says so much about him.
I can conjure his face,
I can conjure his laughter.
You know, he just had this quality to him that he so loved life...
...and he would want us to, you know, move on, move forward.
I feel like, at least I've done what I can for him.
And now, it's just the idea of just kind of moving on...
...and just kind of bringing him with us, sort of.
A few more seconds.
- That's it, we're done.
- All right.
And welcome to the 38th annual NBA All-Star game... from Chicago Stadium.
A standing-room-only crowd.
A steal by Jordan. he spun it away from the Mailman.
Just needs a little time-out to reorganize.
And the chances of a West comeback are slipping away.
Aguirre for three.
I have never seen an All-Star game... that had such spectacular passing... and plays, and thundering plays like this.
They're beginning to hang, Billy.
Ah, what a way to end this ball game.
Right now, I wanna, you know, play in the NBA... like anybody else would wanna be.
That's who -
That's something...
I dream and think about all the time - playing in the NBA. he's just doing something that he loves so much. he just love it so much.
I'm just happy for him.
If somebody can understand the way William play... that'll make me feel a lot better.
The way they should have understood the way I played.
This Chicagoan is making his seventh All-Star appearance.
From the Detroit Pistons, 6'1 "...
Isiah Thomas!
When I get in the NBA... the first thing I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna see my mama, buy her a house...
I'm gonna go there and make sure my sister and my brother's okay.
If we were okay or not.
Probably get my dad... a Cadillac Oldsmobile... so he can cruise in the games.
Something real long.
Dominique.! Ooh.! he dreams about it. he look at those basketball commercials... where they be advertising these Nike shoes? he'll tell his little, small brother...
"Joe,Joe, that's me. "
So the West leads.
Thomas trying to go the distance. Loses it.
I don't even think about it, if he don't make it.
Just 'cause I'm so -
I'm so, you know, focused in on him making it.
I just know he'll make it.
I'm off to Central... and the Congress
Expressway- a park over there where there are some pretty talented young men.
Earl Smith works downtown as an insurance executive.
On weekends he's an unofficial talent scout for several area high schools.
This is what you call
"beating the bushes. "
This is the job of most of your freshmen coaches... and guys like me who - who played a little bit of the game... who love trying to help young people on the road to success.
It's in! It's in!
Today Earl spots Arthur Agee, whojust graduated from grammar school. he's got the quickest first step that I've seen in about five years. his first step.
I will bet you a steak dinner in four years you'll be hearing from him.
I don't even know anything about him.
Several days later,
Earl takes Arthur and his family on a recruiting visit... to the high school where NBA star Isiah Thomas played.
The visit will give
St. Joseph's coaches... a chance to see Arthur perform.
Your role today, Arthur... is to impress the coaches.
Try not to be too fancy.
Take the open shot when you have it.
Play good defense and make good passes.
The rest of it, just play natural,you know.
I'm hoping I'm gonna go to St. Joe and play... but first I gotta -
I gotta get my books straight.
And... hopefully come out and impress the coaches.
Is it kinda scary?
Yes, it is.
I've never been to a school way out before... and I would be going to a school with different kids, different races.
You can look at the scenery, new friends to meet.
What if Isiah's there today?
Well, if he be there...
I'll be shocked...
'cause that'd be my first time ever seeing him... up close, you know, real life.
Basketball has to be second to your academics.
If you don't get your grades, you're not gonna play.
If you work hard at the grades, and if you work hard at basketball... then I would be able to help you as far as going to college.
And I guarantee this.
I can't promise you where you're gonna go and if you're gonna be a star... but I guarantee that I would help you get into the school... that would be best for you.
I'm making a commitment to you... if you make a commitment to being part of this kind of a program.
Out of all of the kids at the St. Joseph Basketball Camp... there are a few like Arthur that Coach Pingatore is recruiting.
It was like million of guys trying to be better than the other... but, to me,
I was better than all of them... except Isiah.
It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you a graduate of St. Joe's... high school all-American... all-American from Indiana University... five-time NBAAll-Star...
Isiah Thomas. hello. how are you?
In everybody's neighborhood, there's a guy who can really play. he can shoot the lights out.
Every time down the court -
Swish, swish, swish!
Then he goes to St. Joseph high School... and the guy gets cut.
You say, "But Tom was real good.
Why did he get cut?'"
See, Tom didn't learn the fundamentals of team basketball... which is what you're learning how to play. he told my daddy that he knew I could play... so hejust had to play me hard.
I can see the playground in him.
I can see talent.
But I don't see the confidence.
With Isiah, I just knew he was gonna be a great one. he had that total combination of personality, confidence, talent... intelligence.
I think I see it in one kid that's coming here. he flows with a smoothness and confidence... and strength... that you don't see in every kid.
But he could become a great player.
You gotta take a shot.
Always work it. You can't block it.
Ohh.!
I just bang him and bruise him.
I'm trying to let him know right now you gonna get hit, get knocked down... you gonna get banged around, so you better get used to it now.
Stop it. One-hand hook.
All these basketball dreams I had, they gone.
All I see -All my dreams in him now.
I want him to make it so bad,
I don't know what to do.
They want to play basketball and stuff, that was always okay.
But I was gonna make sure all of'em got through high school.
A high school diploma was very important to me.
My mother, she was like mother and father to me.
She don't want me really hanging around over here that much...
'cause of the gangs.
I feel if I go to St. Joseph...
I'll at least get a good chance to go to a good college.
That would be good for me.
That was my first son.
I said, "That's Daddy's man, '" so wejust started calling him "Man. '"
Get around it!
I could have been a good college player.
Most likely
I would have made it to the pros.
But, you know, once I had my son...
I knew then something good was gonna come out of it.
I think the talent gonna be passed on. he told me, "I'm so scared of growing up. "
I said, "Why?" he said a grown-up has so many problems.
"I got so many things on my mind. "
I just want Arthur to have more... you know, have a better life than what I had.
I don't want him experiencing bad things that I went through in life.
Austin Boulevard will be the next stop. Austin is next.
Like Isiah Thomas before them... both Arthur and William make a three-hour round trip each day... between the city and St. Joseph's.
That was strange for me going out to a far-out school.
I saw a rug, flowers, clean hallways... things that I didn't see in an ordinary school.
Gotta move! Gotta move!
Come on.
- Three, four, five or 10?
- Ten.
You got it. Three, four, five?
Arthur wins the starting point-guard position on the freshmen team.
Agee, I want you to find in that warm-up number two.
Brown, number three.
Ettmeyer, four. hey, Arthur, you know if you miss free throws... they count 'em up, and you have to pay 15 cents.
Then if you don't pay it, they gonna make you run 50 laps, and still you have to pay the money.
- You still gotta pay the money?
- That's way out.
When Arthur first started at St. Joseph's... he was a good kid, from what we saw... but he was very immature. he might have been a little more disruptive, speaking out... getting into childish things. he wasn't used to the discipline and the control. he reverted back to, maybe, his environment, where he came from.
I just never been around a lot of white people and... it was different, because at a black school
I could associate with the people.
They talk the way I talk.
It was a little hard, but I can adjust to it.
You can see there was talent there.
We kept saying up in the stands,
"Get the ball to Arthur... because he's going to do it for you. '"
And sure enough, they gave him the ball with seconds on the clock.
I noticed a change immediately after he started going out there.
To see your child mature, you say,
"Oh, maybe this is good for him. "
William begins his freshman season on St. Joe's varsity... the top-ranked squad in the state. he's already received several letters... from Division I schools -
Marquette and Rice and Creighton,
Illinois State... to name a few.
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!
Keep back! hold it up! hold it up!
You're killing us!
Why did he get to the ball before you? he asks me, do I wanna be a great player? And I keep saying yeah. he said, "For four years,
I'm gonna be on you every day. "
So he said, "You might as well get used to it now. " hard left. No, no. Go hard left.
Right, I know you can do it.
Left, you can't. All right? Go hard.
Not bad. Do it again.
If you look at Matthew, and again he's saying... at the time the kingdom ofheaven will be like this.
This is how Matthew's gonna useJesus.
This is how he's gonna start it out.
What this is saying is you have to take the faith-
When I first came out here, it was, like, "I wanna go home.
Is this really the right school for me?'"
But every little thing you do that go against their rule... you have detention.
And they'll suspend you quick at the school too.
They'll suspend you quick.
The kids that are willing to do it... are gonna take something away that will help them for the rest of their life.
The kids that are not willing to do it... for whatever reason, uh... are not gonna be very successful as far as here.
The civil rights movement started up in the '50s.
When William first entered St. Joe's... tests revealed he was working on a fourth or fifth-grade level.
I could see that he had the potential... but because he was shy, it seemed as though no one was trying to reach him.
Sister Marilyn told me,
"You have to be one good ballplayer... to get in this school with these grades. '"
- What war beginning in the '60s?
- Vietnam.
At the end of the year, he had gone four grades above... just in the way he listened and learned.
Back in grammar school... academics really didn't matter too much to me at all.
It was playing ball for the team- really, we was the standouts in the school.
If you showed up in class, that was good enough for them.
I was just going to school for the girls.
Trip out with your friends... get out, go play some more basketball.
That was basically it.
Arthur also entered St. Joe's on a fourth or fifth-grade level.
Nobody in their right mind is crazy about school.
If the president brought up a thing right now that say, "Close all schools"... do you think any kids would be trying to go out there, stand on a picket line... and wave and get billboards... saying, "Reopen schools"?
Nice and tall, guys.
Now, don't look at the flash.
Arthur was in the lower group of the general program.
Okay, fellas. Good.
At the end of the year, he was still in the lower group.
One, two, three.!
For Arthur, the season is over. his freshman team finished second in the conference.
William's varsity is rolling through the play-offs.
Against Proviso East,
William plays his best game yet.
And the Chargers move a step closer to going downstate to compete for the title.
St. Joe's made it downstate five of the last six years.
The one thing we haven't done is win a state tournament.
Man, that'd be a big thing if I could go downstate as a freshman.
Isiah was good enough to start on the varsity as a freshman.
I didn't do it because I was worried about bringing him along too rapidly.
I think by not doing it, it cost us a state championship.
In the sectional finals,
Fenwick challenges St. Joe's title hopes.
But in the second quarter,
William steps up.
With his brother Curtis looking on...
William scores 16 points to lead the Chargers to the sectional title.
From Chicago, it's The Sports Writers On TV.
I think I may have seen the next Isiah Thomas.
St. Joe of Westchester has a kid named William Gates... who is starting as a freshman.
Remember, you heard it first from Bill Gleason.
Put it in your memory banks, ladies and gentlemen.
William Gates.
In the supersectionals,
St. Joe's meets DeSalles... to decide who will go downstate.
William plays more like an intimidated freshman than a freshman sensation.
Six-nine senior all-American
Eric Anderson dominates St. Joe's.
But in the third quarter,
William takes over again. he fires over Anderson and is fouled.
William's 13 points in the second half... pull the Chargers to within four.
With less than two minutes to play, it's a must-score.
St. Joe's jump shot falls short.
Eric Anderson.!
Despite the loss,
William's gutty performance... bodes well for next year.
There will be an announcement on ticket sales immediately following the game.
Rewriting 7,300 times 10... to the negative fifth in scientific notation.
Who wants that problem?
- I do.
- Go ahead, William.
- times 10 to the third.
- times 10 to the third times-
- 10 to the negative second.
- Is that good!
Very good.
When I went out there,
I was very intimidated...
'cause I just knew that everybody out there was just smarter than me.
As the year went on... and I was making an "A'"and "B'"honor roll...
I just felt like,
"hey, I'm just as good as them. '"
Now what you have to identify-
Both William and Arthur have partial scholarships from St. Joe's.
The rest of William's tuition is paid for by Cycle... a Cabrini Green organization.
But Cycle can't cover this year's tuition increase.
I was called on by Brother Edwin Duprais. he was trying to raise money to help kids... that couldn't otherwise go to those kind of schools.
It really touched a soft spot in my heart... and so I decided that my husband and I would participate on a personal basis.
William was selected as the kid... that was able to go to school, based on our contribution.
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.
You played a great game. I want you to meet our friends Liz Duncan, Tom Paris.
- Nice game.
- William Gates.
With continuing support from Patricia Wier...
William is assured that his entire education at St. Joe's... will be free.
Arthur's family is paying for half ofhis tuition... and the increase comes at an especially bad time.
Worked for Sara Lee, got laid off.
Uh, worked for Scala's Meat Packing.
Got laid off there. You know.
You look around your house, you see your food getting low. Okay?
And you got your bills due here, your bills due there.
I got called down to the office.
Brother Leo wanted to talk to me. he was telling me about how much, certain money my mama had to pay... for me to stay in school.
They say if she don't have it by this time, you gotta stay out till she pay it.
I was staying out, like, two and three weeks and stuff.
By the end of the freshman year... whatever balance there was for tuition was never taken care of.
Consequently, going into the sophomore year... we had the balance plus the new tuition... so that it was going to continue to become a problem.
Whatever scout that they have come out to these different neighborhoods... and scout out these little basketball players... and get 'em to come to their school and offer them these scholarships.
Then once they get out there, the story is totally different.
I was under the impression that Arthur would have help as far as getting to school...
Arthur would have help in getting his books.
But, see, none of that occur.
Finally, with the Agees owing $ 1,500 in back payments...
St. Joseph's forced Arthur to leave the school.
I thought Pingatore and them would help me out, but -
You have to draw the line because, as I said... tuition is something that, as a school, we depend on... for 90%% of our revenue.
I guess he thought I wasn't gonna be that big of a ballplayer.
So why would he just waste some money on me staying there?
Or, you know, he thought
I wasn't gonna grow. he kept on saying,
"When are you gonna grow?"
Well, I don't know.
If I had known that all of this was gonna lead to this...
Arthur would have never went to St. Joseph's.
I mean, if I had known that he was gonna have to go through this type of pain... and myself- the anguish of it... and then to put him out in the middle of a school year-
I.D. 's, ladies and gentlemen.
All right. Okay, okay. All right.
Can't take no beepers in here.
Give me my beeper, man.
Mr. Wade, I need to see you at the front door.
Now where you gonna go?
Your friend go to jail. No beepers in here.
Don't make no scene.
Arthur is accepted at the public high school near his home. he's been out of school for two months and lost a whole semester's credit. here you have a youngster caught in the middle of two separate school systems. had he stayed at St. Joseph's... he would have been able to receive credit for that first semester.
Doesn't seem fair, but then that's the system.
If he was going out there and he was playing like they had predicted him to play... he wouldn't be at Marshall.
Economics wouldn't have had anything to do with him not being at St. Joe's.
Somebody would have made some kind of arrangement, and the kid would've still been there. he's not making it like they thought he was gonna make it on the basketball court... so he's not there, simple as that.
It doesn't take no brilliant person to figure that out.
It's mid-season when Arthurjoins the sophomore team. he was so depressed and devastated, hejust closed himself off in the room.
I would go in there and tell him every day, "hey, things will look up. '"
Coming off the bench,
Arthur wears number 11...
Isiah Thomas's number.
What kind of techniques were being used... to take away the freedoms that had been earned?
- Jeannetta.
- Poll tax.
Poll tax. Okay, Arthur, what other techniques were used... to keep black Americans from voting?
Um-
You could almost forget about his being there.
That's how quiet he really was.
I think the transition had something to do with it.
In comparing
Marshall high School to St. Joseph...
I don't think that there is any comparison.
People can afford to send their children there.
They can afford to put money into the school.
Once they walk in those doors... they walk in there to get that diploma and to go on to college.
Whereas our students, if they get out ofhigh school... a lot of them, it's an accomplishment.
Trinomial. What's this gonna be?
Both of these are what?
Ifhe wanna go back next year... he gonna go back, if I have to beg.
Because, uh, I wanna help him with his little dream.
Arthur's mother, Sheila, has lost her minimum-wagejob... as a nurse's assistant... because of chronic back pain.
It's just a real hard area to live in, period.
And as far as raising kids - kids don't even have a playground or play area... anything constructive to do in the neighborhood.
But you see why half of them become gangbangers, you know.
Because it's nothing constructive in the neighborhood for 'em.
So now it's, like, you more or less got to keep your kids close to you... and watch 'em at all times.
In June, after 20 years of marriage...
Arthur's dad leaves the family.
Big logjam into the lane.
Jordan's 15-footer good from out front.
Make sure you look at how many shots have been taken.
Jordan might shoot, uh, 15 out of 40.
Fifteen out of 40?
I'm just saying, for instance. he's done it.
But see, if you do that, you're gonna know about it.
Ooh.
Curtis tells William,
"The most important thing... is getting the ball in the basket. '"
Curtis said the boy's good. he say he's real good, but he don't listen. he said if he listen to him, he'd be better. he's always telling me, you should do this and you should do that.
Seems like everybody I know is my coach.
I know a whole lot about basketball.
Now it's Isiah Thomas.
I guess, in so many words,
I'm a pro at that in my mind.
The Trojans were led on the court all season by 6'2'"sophomore guard...
Curtis Gates.
When he went to college, and Michael Jordan first came to the NBA... they would,you know, sit around and argue over him- who could play the best.
Curtis was named Player of the Decade at ColbyJunior College... but he also developed a reputation for being uncoachable.
Curtis's idea of being real good is... you don't follow the rules, you do what you wanna do.
Curtis finally signed at the University of Central Florida... but he didn't get along with the coach and rarely played.
Even ifhe didn't play ball... it was a nice university. he could have finished school.
But he couldn't handle it.
Security. Can I help you?
I'm used to everybody in the neighborhood loving me... and knowing how good I can play.
It just seemed like people looked up to Curtis Gates when it came to basketball... but now...
I'm just a regular old guy on the street now.
Welcome to the prep game of the week... in the Class AA Sectional Final.
You got the guru, the legend, in Gene Pingatore.
Gates.! Good.!
Boy, Gates is on fire.
William Gates is one of the premier sophomores.
William scores
17 points in the first half... as the Chargers look to return to the state finals.
Gates.
Good.! he is a thoroughbred of a player.
Can they get it done here now?
In the second half, Gordon Tech turns to their own sophomore star.
Kleinschmidt drives the middle, puts it up. Good.!
Gordon Tech hangs on to a slender lead in the waning seconds of the game.
Three-point lead with 12 seconds left.
My guy's William Gates.
I'd like to see him get it,just get to go one-on-one and pull up and ice it.
Oh, boy. This is it.
- Gates is the man with the ball.
- That's the one I would want. he's gonna pull up from way out.
Off the front of the rim.!
Kleinschmidt hits it around.
Three seconds left.
Cunningham goes out. It's up.!
No good.! Gordon Tech wins.!
Congratulations to the Gordon Tech Rams.
They're on a joyride, one game now from Champaign.
Come on.
Arthur's season ended well, and he has high hopes... to play for the varsity next year.
Whoo! Lots of iron on that shit.
Arthur's dad shows up.
Man got big hands.
These days, Arthur rarely sees him.
- Watch this. Watch this dunk.
- Joe, I'm gonna go after you, okay?
Watch this.
You got old legs, Dad.
Old legs. hey, man.
I'll see you later on, okay?
Bye.
Increasingly, this playground court... has become a place to buy and sell drugs.
"Dear Mother...
"I hope when Mother's Day comes...
"you will light up the sky with a big smile.
"You, Mother, are the only one in the world...
"who can provide and take care of me.
"You are the one that makes our family work.
"You are the one that I will miss so much when I go away to college.
"No one can replace you ever.
Love always, Man. "
Mother's Day, 1989.
I said to him,
"What are you gonna do this summer?'" he said, well, he didn't know.
So I said, "Well, if you need a job... let me know, and I'll see if I can help you. "
We had a job that didn't require a lot of previous training... so we hired him.
I messed up so bad on my first day
'cause I wanted to do everything right.
Just messed up everything.
Puttin' tapes in the wrong numbers... all sorts of stuff.
But I just pushed myself to come out here... because I know, in the long run, it's gonna be good for myself... and for my family.
I give my mother $50 out of my checks.
All she done for me, I don't think there ever be enough that I can get to pay her back.
Unless I make pro.
Then I'm pretty sure I can pay her back.
I drew on these.
Look at my name.
Tuss.
I had heard that his nickname used to be
Tuss, so I just started calling myself Tuss.
Say "Tuss. '"
You know, I say,
"Man,you may not make it to the NBA. '" he said, "Don't keep on telling me things like that.
That's just like showing me you don't have any trust in what I do. "
I said, "I do, but don't just keep putting everything into this. " he said, "Ain't nobody gonna take my dream away from me.
That's what I wanna be, and that's what I'm gonna do. "
Go first.
I say, "hey, it's your dream.
What can we do?'"
Yeah!
"Dear William, Georgetown University basketball staff is very interested in you. '"
"We are going to kick off the season with a midnight madness celebration. "
Bobby Knight called.
Michigan State - boy, do they ever call.
"Will be on national television. "
Any school you name.
"Dear William, there's gold at the end of the rainbow.
$500 in there for you too. "
Did you see Isiah play the other night?
Yeah, I caught the end of it.
- how'd you like it?
- he played pretty good.
The whole school see me as being a Isiah Thomas.
I'm trying to build my own identity.
When I leave, they're gonna be, like,
"You're gonna be the next William Gates. '"
The St. Joseph Chargers are strictly man-to-man.
- Gene Pingatore believes in that system.
- Watch Isiah come.
- Going down the middle, throws it up.
- What did he do?
- he took the charge.
- he took the charge.
- Something we have to get you to do, right?
- Yeah.
Everything he does is what a coach is looking for.
You listening?
Out to Clark.
This is Thomas with the ball again.
What an eye.!
You're actually a better shooter than Isiah from the outside.
True.
That's heads-up ba -
Oh! Thomas! What a move.
That means you have a lot of responsibility, William.
Can you handle it?
I hope so.
I'm ready to go downstate.
- You wanna go downstate?
- Yeah.
You gotta do something about it.
You have two years to get us down there.
It's going to be all on your head.
Isiah Thomas has just hit his 20th point.
Go.! hold up.! William.
The man playing defense dropped way offhere.
Now, who would you rather have shoot the ball?
Stras shoot the ball there, or you stop in here and shootin' the ball?
- Me.
- Well, shoot it!
William practices today having just recovered from a slight knee injury.
Come on. Let's go.
You're playing soft.
William? Does it bother you?
Don't be afraid though.
Don't favor it.
Tempo.! Tempo.! hold it. That's bullshit!
You didn't jump to the ball and deny the man!
Go!
That's still one.
Nope. It's still one.
We'll stay here all day until you get a 10-seconder.
William, you gotta take it easy.
Go!
Go!
Go.
Now we start all over.
You peoplejust refuse to work.
You don't know what it is to be intense!
And if you don't have it, you're gonna be crap for this team.!
Give me a good reason why I should keep you on this team, Corey. how 'bout you, Reed?
Give me a good reason.
What do you think, William?
I mean, how many of these people work hard?
- Not too many.
- Not too many.
Wanna stay home when the state tournament comes?
All right. Go on in.
The next day in practice,
William reinjures his knee.
You, most likely, have at least torn this cartilage... the inside cartilage of your knee.
And you may have a ligament tear in your knee, okay?
If the ligament is torn, William, you would miss this year... entirely.
This is a lot to happen to you at an early age. A lot.
I think, if all goes well... you'll be able to come back.
Everything was just going great.
Now this.
All you guys can't get large.
- Somebody accidentally-
- What's up, man?
Somebody gotta wear medium.
You little skinny guys wanna get in a large.
What the other guys gonna put on?
Watch that boy. he'll steal your drawers.
Junior year, Arthur makes varsity for the Marshall Commandos.
This is the year, right?
This is it.
All righty.
Not too bad.
Fine.
Back home, the family's troubles have worsened.
Now I'm on welfare... that I wasn't on then.
And trying to live month-to-month on something like that is very hard.
You have three growing kids that need this... and you have bills to pay... and it's just not enough to make ends meet.
Man.! Sweetie, is Man in there?
I was never raised on welfare.
My mother and father both worked.
We was cut off for three months.
We was cut off aid complete with no income.
So, therefore, do you know what happened?
Our lights were cut off.
Our gas was cut off.
And we were sittin' in the dark.
They had cut me offbecause
I failed to meet an appointment.
It hurt everybody.
It changed everybody's attitude.
That you can have something today and it's gone tomorrow.
So you know what the system is saying to me?
Do you know what it's saying to a lot of womens in my predicament?
They don't care.
The good news is that your ligament looks fine.
- Good.
- Okay? Your ligament looks fine.
We can actually sew the cartilage back.
So you're looking at a minimum of 12 weeks, maybe 16 weeks... before I'll let you play ball again.
Possibly being able to play by tournament time.
Okay?
I'm gonna slip you a little something into the I.V... to kind of take the edge off of things, okay?
All right?
- I can tell.
- Yeah.
No doubt.
- Let's turn him.
- Yeah, this way.
If it stays there.
Probably go with the right post here and little stuff.
The doctor told me he wasn't gonna even try to get him ready to play this year.
So what do you think that gon' do to his career?
I really thought Curtis was gonna make it.
But he didn't make it, so I just wanted to try-
I just wanted this one to make it.
We were able to repair the cartilage.
Okay?
When basketball is over,
William may not have a friend in the world.
Curtis lost his job as a security guard... and has been unemployed for over four months.
Sometimes I sit around and my eyes just kinda get watery...
'cause I be, like,
I ain't amounted to nothing.
You know, I ain't got nothing.
I can't even go out there and get a job making seven dollars an hour.
I'll be sitting there telling myself,
"You ain't gonna get no better. '"
What did y'all tell me about after y'all go to college and everything... y'all get your own place?
We can all go to Arby's, baby.!
- And get fresh Matt's Cookies.
- And going toJewel's for our meat.
- That's a lot of food stamps.
- We ain't gonna need no food stamps.
Each day is a struggle.
Trying to deal with the kids'attitudes as well as my own... and trying to be strong enough for them and myself.
- That is so neat.
- I forgot to turn in my work.
That is what you call a neat paper.
Yeah, that's neat.
Don't you say that about my son.
My son got a brain.
Now, you cut that out.
- But he don't use it.
- See that brain there?
Now there are two new members of the Agee household.
Arthur's sister Tomika has a baby girl named Jazz.
And Arthur's best friend Shannon moved in to escape his own troubled home.
Shannon is like me. he understood me, and I understood him. he could sit back and talk to me
'cause I was his best friend. he trusted me, and I trust him.
It's been crazy, as far as his father and his mother's breakup. he'll come home, and Bo stealing and buying drugs... and beat on his mother and stuff.
You have to call the police or get an order of protection... for him to leave me alone.
My father was the same way.
I think about it all the time, when you come home, and they fightin'.
You know, that gets to a child's head.
They can't - Especially when you're living with your mother... and you young, and that's all you see all the time. he had to do something to keep his spirit up.
Ahh!
Why you -
Starting at guard, number 11, a junior, Arthur Agee.!
When I played basketball,
I knew what I wanted to do.
This is what I want,you know.
This is what I wanna do for the rest of my life.
Come on, win it, boy!
Get that ball.! he's way behind where I think he should be at this point.
I've had a few guys come to me from college -
"Ooh, I like that kid. he's quick, he's fast. "
But something's missing with Art.
Shannon was on the basketball team too. he was a little more raw than Arthur is.
I couldn't handle two guys like that... so I tried the lesser of the evils.
That was Arthur.
Marshall's won six and lost 14... their worst record in 20 years.
You just in a hurry to do nothing...
'cause that's exactly what you're doing - nothing.
After spending most of the game on the bench...
Arthur gets another chance.
Get that ball.! Work that ball, boy.!
Yes.! That's the way you do it.!
In the final minutes of a close game...
Arthur takes it strong to the hoop. he's called for charging and fouls out of the game.
- There's been some bad calls all day.
- Amen!
I'm telling you. Oh!
The daily regimen of rehabilitation... is not the only change in William's life.
Say "hey!"
- hey!
- Say "hey!"
I was just basically scared to tell people.
I was feelin'sick,you know... holding all this stuff inside of me.
I couldn't let it out.
When I did finally tell Coach, he was like, "When did this come about?'"
And I said...
"Oh... three, four months ago. " he was like,
"Three or four months ago?"
I was in the delivery room.
The nurses gave her to her... and she handed the baby to me, you know.
And I'll never forget how hard she was squeezing my hand.
Once we got her home
William offered his help and stuff... but it was almost like I didn't want it
'cause she was mine.
You know?
Instead of the two of us.
So then, after a while we -
I finally let him keep her.
And he earned his title.
You smell good.
Your numbers look real good.
I think you're two to three weeks away from being able to practice full.
- You know what I mean?
- Two or three weeks?
I know you wanted to waltz in here today and I'd tell you to go back to practice right now... but I don't want it to have to tear again.
I felt that this was the year for me.
I know we can make it downstate.
That's just a big dream I done had.
I look up on the scoreboard-
My name is not even on there anymore.
Where do I fit in with this team?
William takes a makeup exam in math... because he skipped the final. here's the cutoff point for passing.
And you ended up right there.
So you passed the final - barely.
When I stopped playing ball, all my grades just sunk.
I understand we, uh - we got the A.C.T. results.
Yeah.
Not as good as we, uh - we wanted, huh?
William scores a 15 on his first A.C. T. he needs to score an 18 to qualify for an athletic scholarship... to any four-year university.
I think what we have to do is get you set up with the Britannica course.
We'll have to talk to Mrs. Wier.
Okay?
Sometimes you have had the right answer and you changed it to the wrong answer.
Through Patricia Wier,
William's St. Joe's sponsor... the cost of the six-week class is waived.
If you're just outright guessing -
If a monkey took this test and you trained him to do just B's and C's... he probably would get more right than if he picked A's and D's.
You just don't know the feeling... not knowing if you gonna be able to play... just because of a test.
I mean, as soon as you don't tighten one screw, everything falls apart.
- El caballo.
- El caballo.
- La vaca.
- La vaca.
Arthur, ¿Tienes tu el libro?
¿Tienes tu el libro?
Mmm.
- What do I say?
- Okay, how do you say "yes"?
"Yoy. '"
- how do you say "yes" in Spanish?
- Sí.
Sí. Look up on the board. he's a pretty smart kid, but he does just enough to pass. hey, Shannon!
Most of them that have come through here... and had that type of attitude... usually end up in the streets talkin'about they used to play for Marshall... and if they'd gone to class they could've gone to any school they wanted to.
This is just somebody standing on the street corner talking... trying to find a job, then can't find a job, that kind of thing.
This is where he's headed, really.
- how's your knee?
- It's pretty good.
Easiest thing right now would be for you not to play and wait till next year.
What do you wanna do?
- Wait till next year?
- Right.
- No.
- You think you're ready?
My next year is now.
I've seen athletes who have come back from surgery... where they worried about the injury.
When this happens, they may never be the player they were.
William's first start is the final home game of the regular season.
William should have shot it. he gotta do that the whole game. he only do it when they leadin'.
It was like my injury was making him look bad.
Run it out.!
I always felt that Curtis... should not be living his dream through me.
If he don't do somethin' out here on this court -
Man, he ain't showed me nothin' yet.
You gotta come out and start playing hard all the time.
Otherwise you're just another player.
You follow me?
Just remember the way we talked.
Okay? As long as you're physically able.
If you're not, you shouldn't be playing at all.
So nervous about the start tonight.
But I'm glad it's over with.
Now I can just... get onto the floor more better.
Spread the floor to four corners!
St. Joe's has made it to the sectionals.
And in the final minutes...
William goes to the free throw line with the Chargers leading by six.
Always a clutch free-throw shooter... he sinks four straight to help seal the victory.
In the sectional finals...
St. Joe's looks for revenge against Gordon Tech... the team that knocked them out last year.
With his whole family watching...
William seems out of sync and bothered by his knee.
You are not working hard enough!
You understand me?
They want it harder than you!
At the beginning of the fourth quarter...
St. Joe's leads by a point.
Got any pain with that?
While the doctor examines William's knee...
Gordon Tech surges ahead.
The Chargers steal the ball, trailing by one.
William calls time-out.
I want it down floor so we can get it to one of our good jumpers.
With only seconds on the clock... the Chargers find William in the corner.
The shot doesn't fall, but William is fouled.
With six seconds to go...
William steps to the line with two free throws... and a chance to win. he shouldn't have been out there. he shouldn't have been playing.
- The knee?
- I'm very disappointed.
Y'all get that on tape 18 times.
Disappointed in the system. he shouldn't have been out there playing. his knee came out of place a couple of times, it looked like.
I mean, if winning's that important, we need to reevaluate the program.
That ain't no excuse. he got out there, said there wasn't nothin' wrong with him.
That's an excuse.
If he was hurt, he shouldn't have got out there.
There's two possible problems you could have.
You might have healed, say, 80% of that cartilage... and still have a small residual tear.
William's brother-in-law, Alvin... takes him to see Dr. hefferon, the Chicago Bulls team doctor.
What you need to do is have your knee arthroscoped again.
- What side we gonna do?
- Right side.
Right.
A lot of people say I shouldn't have played, shouldn't have came back at all.
Coach kept sayin' it's really up to me... and if you leave it up to me
I'm goin'back out there on the court.
We're gonna remove this portion of the cartilage here. he'll have a higher incidence of arthritis as he gets older than you or I would.
But in terms ofhis basketball career, he has a good chance of performing fine.
- There's the medial meniscus.
- Wow.
It's the only thing on my mind, is gettin' downstate... is makin' it down there.
I want to be able to go all out the whole year.
No setbacks, no nothin'.
At least Coach won't have to say,
"William, you didn't play hard this game"...
'cause when I step on that floor
I'm gon' be all business, and that's it.
One year after he left...
Arthur's dad Bo rejoins the family. he spent seven months in jail for burglary... and overcame an addiction to crack cocaine.
Man might fail ya, butJesus never fails.!
Praise God.! Whoo.!
If you haven't tried him, try him.!
Sometimes you look for friends and they're not there.
- ButJesus is always there.
- Amen.!
- Even in the midnight hour, he's there.
- Amen.
Glory to God.! Whoo.!
- hallelujah!
- hallelujah!
Glory to God.
Lord, we know you always bless the family.
Glory to God. Even in the beginning, Lord, you blessed that first family.
Glory to God. We pray right now, don't let nothin' come between 'em.
Send strength, Lord, glory to God, wherever there is weakness.
Please, Lord... let the love prevail.
- Yeah.!
- Thank you,Jesus.! Thank you, Lord.!
That's right.
While I was incarcerated...
I just asked God,
"Show me a different way.
Give me a new life. Take the taste of drugs and evil way of thinkin'away from me. '"
I asked the Lord to forgive me for what I did... the times that I mistreated my wife, beat her physically,you know.
I just hope this be a lesson to my children... to see me turn my life over to the Lord.
Oh,yeah.!
When I was little... he had let me down.
People used to come up to me -
"Your father a drug addict" and stuff.
And I'd just be, like, "Yeah, okay. "
You know?
And I used to take so much, you know... that he has to start realizin' that, you know - that what is he doing, you know.
'Cause I remember sometimes he used to try to go to church while he still - he was still on drugs while he was tryin' to go to church.
Give me a hug before you go.
- Give your granddad a hug.
- Thank you!
The closeness was not there at first, when I come back home.
And then Arthur, he was watchin'me-
What move would I make now?
Am I just... bein' like this since I just come back... or am I gonna break bad again?
William's dad invites him down to his auto repair shop. he hasn't lived with the family since William was a baby.
The car that I was gonna give you, uh, I didn't finish it up yet.
I got some more to do to it yet.
I didn't see him for, like, three years.
It never popped in my mind.
- The car back there?
- No, that's the car right over there.
That black Cutlass right there.
I think he's, like...
"Oh, he really must be able to play some basketball. '"
I think now he sees somethin'at the end for himself.
I remember one time he tried to whup me, but I wouldn't let him.
I said, "You may be my dad biologically, but as far as being there-
Enough. '"
You say you'd like to come to my next show that I do?
Yeah, come out and... finally get a chance to see you sing and -
Okay. What I'll have to do -
I don't have my schedules right this minute.
But I'll have to get that, and I'll let you know.
Alicia, you're my only friend.
"A'wight? Jimmi-fi. "
Thank you.
I always knew that I was gonna be a better dad than he was.
I wouldn'tjust leave her like that.
- Alicia?
- hmm? Yes, Mama?
If Alicia has a problem, then I have a problem.
She's believing whatever she said.
William's second rehabilitation... is at the Baxter Clinic... used by many of Chicago's pro athletes.
Both of William's operations and rehabs have been paid for by the school's insurance.
Don't expect to be playing in a game the first day back.
My mother put a big restriction on those pickups.
She said, "These are her knees now. "
When you're out on a date, do you have to have sex?
- No! No! No!
- Yes, you do!
No,you don't!
What about the woman's perspective?
All right, quiet down a minute here.!
For the second straight year,
Arthur and Shannon must take summer school.
- Restate your question.
- What'd I say?
Shut up!
This class is for freshmen, sophomores andjuniors... who have failed English.
The basic problem here... is that we were strapped for money... and we only had one English class available to our students. hopefully you could touch a nerve in some of them... like a spirited discussion on a controversial topic.
Because exactly what is having sex... but engaging in an act that doesn't fulfill -
Shannon really didn't care... so hejust stopped coming... and he was dropped from the roll.
Usually in an illicit-
Even if Arthur passes summer school... he may not graduate with his class next year... because St. Joseph's is refusing to release his transcripts.
I called up the school.
The lady explained to me that he owed $1,800... so I felt, well, they have a school policy there... and there's, uh, nothing
I can do about that.
About how much can you afford?
Okay, we're looking at 18-
- Oh.
Well, to total that out... and from here to -
June -When is graduation?
We're looking at somewhere around-
It's 181.30 per month.
Is there any way possible that his-
I don't know. I'm just asking.
- Sure.
- Could his credits be released too?
I will get a promissory agreement drawn up. Okay?
As long as you show me good faith after the first two months...
I'll release 'em, uh -
That would be end of September.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
- Then I'll send 'em to Marshall.
- Okay. That would be fine with us.
- I really appreciate this.
- how's Arthur doing, anyway?
Pretty good.
I can't really complain about him.
- Good.
- Wish he could've stayed here, though.
- Yeah. Me too.
- Well, things-
- Things happen, you know, and -
- Things happen,you know, and-
- hey-
- That's part oflife.
- I can't let him down no more.
- Good.
Okay, good.
I hope we can work something out then.
- I'd like to thank you.
- No problem.
- That's why we're here.
We try to help people.
- That's right.
- Okay? Very good.
- All right. Thank you very much.
- have a nice day.
- Take care now.
Okay. Very good.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- That's what I need.
- Yeah.
I think about it- had I not been on drugs when Arthur went to St. Joseph's... just how good it would have been for him. he wouldn't have had to leave. here's one of the corners right here where I used to come up and cop all the time.
Threw away a lot of money on these corners, boy.
I almost threw my life right along with it. he can just look at my life... and say here's a good example of what not to do.
If he had my ways...
I would be shakin' in my shoes right now. hey, look at that Georgetown coat.
Man, I might get that.
- Dang!
- Pocket on the side.
That's the one I was tellin' you about. how much?
Seventy bucks even, no tax.
Some of the drug pushers in the neighborhood... they'll give us money, tell us,
"Go shoppin; Go get you somethin; '"
They're thinkin; we playin'basketball and they can give us stuff... and keep our career goin;
So that's how we were to keep up with the styles.
A'ight.
While you're sitting here today... you should feel like a million dollars.
You should feel so special.
You are one of a hundred of the best high school players... in this country, the United States.
My mother, God bless her, she's in heaven today.
She used to always say to me, "This is America.
You can make something of your life. "
Come on! Come on!
Okay.
All the coaches from over here.
To the stands, please, coaches!
Coaches, we gotta clear!
If you a player, somebody up there gonna recognize that you a player.
So there's 250 of us here.
We're doing it to try to find out who the best players are and get 'em in our program.
There aren't very many kids at any level, including the NBA... that really understand what basketball is all about.
We always say, you're going to war, would you want him behind you covering your flank?
If you're pouting, they're gonna also recognize that.
And don't tell me they're not gonna write it down in that book.
At the prestigious Nike camp...
William hopes to prove the injuries are behind him... and he belongs among the nation's best.
One, two, three.
Next.!
One, two, three, four.!
Arthur and Shannon spend their summer at Pizza hut earning 3.35 an hour.
Yeah.
- hello. how are you all doing today?
- Fine.
It's a waste of my time down here.
I'm ready to go home. here I am, always tryin' to play this team ball.
A few coaches - more coaches comin' around to look... everybody feel they gotta do they own little thing here.
Move it.! Move it.!
Stick in the post.!
Some of you are gonna make it where you want to be... and others of you will not make it.
This is summer for them.
They don't wanna be sitting in a classroom.
But we provide them with an experience... you can't get anywhere else... in that we simulate what it's going to be like to be a student athlete.
Fifteen hours a week for basketball. how many hours do we have up here?
The statistics on Division I players graduating from college are really frightening.
Let's assume you're playing big-time college basketball... and your team travels-
You have to realize... that nobody cares about you.
You're black, you're a young male.
All you're supposed to do is deal drugs and mug women.
The only reason why you're here- you can make their team win.
If their team wins... these schools get a lot of money.
This whole thing is revolving around money.
Recruiting is like any other sales business.
We've gotta win to keep our jobs.
We've gotta fill the arena to keep our jobs.
And if we don't, they fire us.
I mean, that's - hey, if bankers don't make money, they fire them.
When you look at some of these young boys' bodies, they got NBA bodies already.
There's one particular kid who's here now...
I've watched him since sixth grade;
I've watched him blossom.
That's when you wanna get on 'em - when they're young - and start writin' 'em before everybody else writes 'em.
Try to get any edge you can in this business.
It's already become a meat market.
But I try to - to, uh, do my job... you know, and serve professional me.
What schools do you think are most involved with William right now?
I would say DePaul...
Marquette, Indiana, Michigan.
Excellent.
Great job! Way to go!
Bob Gibbons done seen me play my best game out here.
Turned in 16 points, 12 assists.
Bob Gibbons over there like this -
"hmm. "
Yeah, I was smilin' too, Bob.
Give me a slice of the crust.
Probably will.
Thanks a lot.
Look. hey, Mom.
Right now I'm feelin'good about myself.
I really feel like, since I been down here, that I was all-American.
When I go back home
I'm gonna feel unstoppable.
This one eyebrows up.
This one eyebrows up.
Swing it!
Whoo-hoo!
I'm gonna pull up on it, okay?
Tell me if it hurts more.
- Yeah.
- It hurts more when I do that?
Easy does it, now.
It's on the muscle.
It's not on the joint. It's above the joint.
Okay?
What's your name?
Though it's only a muscle injury... it's severe enough that
William will not compete for the final two days of the camp. how many electives you need to graduate?
- Six.
- Six?
Arthur's transcript from St. Joseph's has arrived.
If you pass all of the classes that you're presently taking... you can graduate from summer school.
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- have you taken the A.C.T.?
- Mm-mmm.
When do you plan to take it?
Sometime soon.
What institution are you planning on going to? have you decided that?
I was, um, thinking about, going to, um... Alabama.
But you need to take
Algebra-Trig. Okay?
Do you plan to take that?
I don't know.
You don't know?
So you just barely gettin'by again.
No. You ain't gotta say that.
But you are.
You've been barely gettin'by all along.
Now, you gonna have to do better than that if you wanna go to Alabama... or any other school.
You gonna have to do more than just get by.
Don't forget to bring those papers back to me.
- Okay.
- All right.
St. Joe's just messed everything up.
Shouldn't have even went there.
Thought I had more credits than this.
They gon' kick me out
'cause I ain't payin' 'em money. Man!
That's all right, though.
I'm gonna still make it.
"Don't let your best opportunity get away from you.
"You can have a great experience at Marquette University.
"Once you visit our campus...
"I feel confident that you will know that Marquette is the right place for you.
Sincerely, Kevin O'Neill. "
I like these.
I been gettin; like, two a week from the school for... a couple of months.
So that's quite a few.
I know you're game, but, Monica,you seem very overwrought.
I had Division I offers.
I had even signed at Marquette
'cause they thought I was gonna make the grades.
The great ballplayers... they care about basketball more than they care about school... and I know they do.
Shaky. Shaky.
Ohh.!
Let me try somethin;!
If you're looking for a progressive college basketball program... with experienced leadership and a winning tradition... then the Marquette Warriors are for you.
William's first home recruiting visit.
Three top schools postpone visits... preferring to wait and see how William will do his senior year at St. Joe's.
If you don't make the test score, it doesn't mean we don't want you... because we still do- that's what I'm telling you.
If you tear your knee out again this year... and you can't play ever again... you're gonna have your education paid for at Marquette University.
I know that the scholarship is one-year renewable.
Gene's right about this, but any school worth its salt is gonna give you four years.
The bottom line is this- we want to win the national title.
Number two- I wanna make you the best player I can.
I wanna give you an opportunity to, maybe someday... be one of those guys that makes some money in Europe or in the NBA.
You're one of seven guys that we're recruiting right now.
- You're recruiting seven guys?
- Seven guys for three spots.
Where he fit in?
- Where does he fit in?
- Yeah.
As soon as William tells me he's not looking at any other schools... then I'm not looking at any other players.
So, what?
The first one sign, that's -
Well- Well, that's what it's gonna come down to.
If I tell you that, hey, you're our guy and this and that... and I lose you to Kansas, Indiana,
North Carolina State or something...
I'm out ofluck.
The president's saying to me,
"I thought you were recruiting a guard. '"
It's a tough situation, but it's something that has to be done.
It's a great place.
We're gettin'ready to have it rockin;
The best is yet to come.
Lot of serious ballplayers been through this building-
Junior Bridgeman, Sidney Moncrief,
Bob Lanier, Oscar Robertson.
Can you see yourself playing in this place here, 18,000 in it?
Big difference from St. Joe's, now.
We stayed at the hyatt.
Man, it was nice. Real nice.
They had these balloons all hangin' up on the ceiling, everything.
They-They really did it up.
And I must say, we did it up too.
We - Room service.
Man! had these phony newspapers written up.
Notre Dame 77, Marquette 76.
Gates is out high, calling for the ball.!
There are six seconds left.
The freshman spins past the defender, slicing to his left to the foul line.
Three seconds left.
Marquette down by one.
Gates launches a running one-hander.!
It's on the way.!
It is good.!
Gates buries a 13-footer just ahead of the horn... and Marquette has defeated Notre Dame.!
If you think we care about you a lot in recruiting... we're gonna do more when you're here.
Don't let it get to a point where somebody else comes in and takes a scholarship away.
Let us know what you wanna do- unless you know what you wanna do right now. he knows, but he won't say.
You talked to any, uh... leading black people on the campus?
- The leading black people?
- Yeah.
- Such as?
- Whoever might be in charge... of all the black students on campus - what kind of community life they have for the blacks there.
- Uh -
- Did you talk to anyone about it?
- Did you ask the players how they're treated?
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?
- Players say they treated fine.
I mean, they get the best of everything.
- You think that's where you wanna go?
- Yeah.
That's fine.
Obviously, if you wait you'll have all the other schools that were on you before... like Kansas and Indiana and North Carolina State.
That's all right, uh, but...
I discussed it with -
I think you should take a few days.
Because you just came back.
You understand?
- Poop!
- Yeah!
Yea!
Boo!
Is there any cash with this?
Uh, it's in the mail.
To four years of excellence.
- hear! hear!
- hear! hear!
- It's alcohol-free.
- It's not that bad.
I am fixing him a birthday dinner today.
It's his 18th birthday... and I want to show him how much we appreciate him and love him... and care for him.
Everything that you can imagine was going wrong with this family... but now everybody's together.
It's his favorite cake. he's a great kid.
And some kids don't live to get this age, you know.
That's another thing to be proud about - that, you know, it's his 18th birthday, he lived... and to get to see 18, that's good.
I wanna tell you that I love you very much.
I'm very proud of you.
It seems like I was 18 just yesterday. here. happy birthday. I love you.
- Ohh.!
- hey-hey.!
- happy birthday!
- I love you too.!
- Come over here.
- Where you goin', homes?
Where you goin', homes?
Blow out the candles.!
Two months after his 18th birthday...
Arthur is cut off public aid.
This is what I brought to their attention. he's still a full-time student. he hasn't graduated yet.
So why would you-all cut him off?
- I'll bite you!
- I'll bite you back.
They feel like when they get 18... most the black kids they drop out.
So that means that the child is just thrown out there.
I was gettin' 368.
Now I get 268.
And that's it.
And that's to take care of me from one month to the next.
Now, can you imagine a person living on that?
Do you-all wonder sometime, how am I livin'?
Or how do my children survive, or how they livin'?
It's enough to make people really wanna go out there and lash out and hurt somebody.
A message to the Oreo cookie.
No matter how much you wanna switch, here's what they think about you:
Fried chicken and biscuit-eatin'monkey, ape, baboon... big-thighed, fast-runnin; high-jumpin; spear-chuckin;..
360-degree basketball-dunkin;.. pit-swingin'spade moulanyan.
Go the fuck back to Africa.
Go the fuck back to Africa.
Go the fuck back to Africa.
Think about it. Fuckin'sellout.
Play the music, motherfucker!
Put the music on!
Shoot it.
Rebound.! Go, go, go.!
Gates stinks.
You got that? he stinks. he doesn't play with confidence, like he did before he was injured.
I don't believe the other players have complete confidence in William.
They were in awe of William when he was a sophomore.
They're not in awe ofhim anymore.
Sophomore year...
I was just carefree.
If it could be done,
I was gonna do it.
I wish I could get that attitude back.
Go.! hold up.!
That's crap.!
That is dog-shit crap.!
Why did you have to do something unnecessarily?
If you would've kept it over here, William -
Look at me!
If you had kept it over here, wide, you could have gone all the way.
What is that crap, the shovel pass?
There was never any point in our school... where wejust- just played outright,you know.
Now, remember, think about the ball game on the way to the game.
I'll bet a nickel.
If I got a nickel.
Yeah, I got it!
Marshall began its season well... winning four of six.
Today's game will be their first against a city power.
The only way you gonna beat them is to play good basketball.
All that bullshit that you be playin' -
You play half of a game, for two or three minutes you play pretty good... then you go to sleep.
You have to play a whole ball game.
When we start out,
Arthur will be completely in the ball game.
But as the game progresses, then he digresses.
By halftime, Marshall trails highly favored Dunbar by 15 points.
But late in the fourth quarter...
Arthur and the Commandos claw their way back.
On a crucial possession... the ball goes to Arthur. hey, boy!
Gimme some, boy! hey, Arthur G! hey, Arthur G! You ever got rich, they'd catch you for sure! Come here, dog!
That's it, man.!
Showin'your beef!.
I want it up high, G.
I want it up high.
Led by William's 16 points a game... the Chargers have a 20 and 3 record.
But Coach Pingatore feels they're not ready for the impending play-offs.
Alabama.! Alabama.!
Alabama.!
Well, don't throw the ball!
Jesus, will you cut it out and quit acting like a baby!
Will you quit cryin'!
This team just drives me crazy.
It's been a struggle all year.
You think you're better than you are.
The two big guys are prima donnas.
They should be killin'people.
For you people that are really agonizing... andjust hate all this stuff and all the hollering... if you don't make a turn, it'll be over next week... so you won't have to worry about it.
That's the point.
I wanna end this game in the next three to four minutes.
Otherwise it's gonna be a ball game.
All right, let's go get 'em. Come on. hail Mary, full of grace.
Blessed art thou - holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
All right, let's go.
Come on.
William's just too nice of a kid.
I don't know ifhe has the killer temperament.
I don't know ifhe has the eye of the tiger. he's gonna need that when he goes to the next level.
Remember, square up!
It's business, it's big bucks... and that's what the scholarship's for.
Good job.
- his coach is stingy and selfish.
- My coach is not - he just want William to run out there and play-
- My coach is not stingy and selfish.
- Yes, he is!
The day she was gonna be born
I told him he had to be there.
I don't care what his coach say.
I know the game was important.
But this was more important, and his coach doesn't see it like that.
I just can't miss a game... just because, you know, an incident occur... unless it was like a death or somethin' like that.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Ain't like the girl was born every day.
That's what I was tryin' to get you to say.
Especially around that time of the year too - state tournament.
It was simply out of the question. he tells me,
"Well, it'll benefit us in the future. '"
I'm, like, "But what about now?" he keeps sayin' in the fu -
Basketball was my ticket out of the ghetto.
If I wouldn't have been playin'ball,
I would not even be goin'to college.
I'm goin' to college, and I have a daughter.
So what's my excuse?
- Because the situations are much different.
- No, it's not.
I haven't been workin'for about a year.
And if it wasn't for William knowing Miss Wier...
I wouldn't even be here.
'Cause I walked in the door and that's the first thing I see on the sign
- "No openings. "
It ain't much better than a person without a college degree can get.
So I feel like I'll be here for quite a while.
What you lookin' at?
I don't believe people when they be sayin; "Wow, school's hard.!'"
The work weren't hard for me.
All right. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
If I gotta do, like, a report or somethin;..
I don't like none of the topics, so I'll just pick somethin'that's simple.
So, what's the topic of your paper?
The life cycle of the butterfly.
- Gonna read it for us?
- Mm-mmm.
Aw, come on.!
No, man!
- I wanna hear it-
- I'm just doin' this stuff!.
I know, but I just wanna hear how you write.
"Well, as the people bloom into another year-"
You know, the year just changed,
January 1.
"The butterfly also blooms.
The butterfly are very beautiful flying objects. "
Then it say at the beginning of the butterfly, it goes through a change and all that.
Then I keep goin', man.
I just wanna, like, do that stuff.
Then I'll just keep goin' on and on and on... and I won't never stop.
Move out the way! Move!
Look out! Move out the way!
Its botanical name is Cannabis sativa.
Millions of Americans break the law and use it.
Arthur's latest report card shows... he's failing both Spanish and Science. he rushes through his work.
As you see, he just missed one assignment.
Mm-hmm.
But his test scores were pretty low.
- he had a 10 on one test.
- Mmm-mm-mmm.
Will you do me a favor?
When you see things are slippin' like this, give me a call and let me know.
Let me make sure I have the right phone number.
So I can stay up on top of this boy.
Because he tells you one thing -
I say, "Where your book?" "We didn't have to work on the book. It's in my locker. " he gonna have to start showin' me somethin' better. he probably on the borderline, and all that clownin', people just give him an "F."
That's what I would do too.
But I'm gon' stay up on his behind this time around.
'Cause I told him we payin' 181-odd dollars out there to St. Joseph's...
Right. for his transcripts. he got the transcripts and he ain't doin' that?
Uh-uh. It ain't gonna happen like that.
Man.!
You remember I told you, whatever I start I finish.
I'm not like some people I know.
I don't need nobody to push me.
All I gotta do is have the goal and the motivation, and I'm ready.
It's Sheila's graduation day... from a nurse's assistants class at a local community center.
A high grade will assure her certification.
I want to be an R.N. nurse.
I've always had that dream.
Well, Miss Agee.
- Sheila.
- hmm?
You scored 89 on the exam.
You're gonna get the highest grade point average for the class.
Really? Really?
No, no, no, no!
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you!
Oh, I'm so happy!
Oh, thank you, Miss Martin!
You did it yourself.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, you so good.
I didn't think I could do it.
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah, you did.
You gave me that belief in myself.
You're really inspiring me to go on.
Not just stop right here, but go farther.
And people told me
I wasn't gon' be anything.
The gym is packed for today's game against West Side rival, Westinghouse.
Marshall's rebounded from last year's dismal 9 and 16 record... to go 16 and six.
And Arthur has emerged as the Commandos' second-leading scorer and assist man.
Rebound.!
Somejunior colleges have begun to notice.
A lot of these kids won't talk to a junior college... really until after they've seen the dream of, you know...
Illinois and Nevada, Las Vegas and Georgetown kind of fade.
Ajunior college could be Arthur's only hope.
Without better grades and an 18 on the A.C. T... major colleges can't offer him a scholarship.
It's just too bad those kids don't realize... hey, if they had an 18, the door is so much wider open.
You're in the middle.!
In the fourth quarter, the Commandos fight back from an
11-point halftime deficit.
They trail by one.
We gotta play more aggressive on defense.
We're not good at playin' on defense.
Yeah, man.
Defense!
Derrick Zinneman's layup pushes Marshall to a one-point lead.
Moments later, a Westinghouse foul... and then a double technical puts Arthur on the line with a chance to ice the victory.
One more! Whoo!
The upset win is sweet vindication for the unranked Commandos.
- Arthur Agee, you lead the books.
- Junior!
You got seven.
Seven turnovers.
Even for the guards, that's too many.
This is a good win for you, but it doesn't mean anything.
You gotta do better than that, man.
You have to do better than that.
Yeah, man.
That was a good game though.
You could have played better though, you know.
Oh, Mom. You know he did good.
You'rejust killing me.
You know your mother's proud of you. he been gettin' down.
Like a real star.
Number 11...
Arthur Agee.!
Nearly four years after discovering Arthur on the playground...
Earl Smith shows up to see Arthur win his first play-off game.
I figured this game and the next game may be his last high school ball game.
- Where you been, man?
- Where I been?
- Yeah. Where you been?
- I've been workin'.
- Oh, yeah, right.
- I've been following you in the paper.
- Oh, yeah. You impressed or somethin'?
- Yeah. I'm impressed. I'm here, ain't I?
- If I wasn't, I wouldn't have followed you.
- You been talking to Ping?
- For what?
- You don't talk to him no more?
- Why not?
- What do I have to talk to him about?
- Well,Jamal -
- You ain't there.
- Yeah, you're right. I had to break out.
- Yeah.
So I was thinkin' about goin' tonight to see, uh, St. Joe and Nazareth play... but I wasn't sure if you had time to do it.
Yeah.
I've got a bitter taste in my mouth about a lot of things that happened.
A lot of people accuse me of taking youngsters... out of the inner city and taking them out to St. Joe high School... and they ask what did I get out of the deal and... a lot of racial slurs and so forth from my own people about me, about what I did.
I still felt and feel that I was doing the right thing... for that particular time.
Uh, sometimes I have second thoughts... when I see the net results of what happened with the youngsters.
Arthur.
- Arthur-
- Arthur Agee, sophomore.
My gosh. What are you doin'?
- What are you doin' now?
- Goin' to school.
- Where?
- Marshall.
Oh, I taught him.
Can you believe it?
- So you came in case you have to play St. Joe's?
- Yeah.
Arthur. Arthur.
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?
- What you been up to?
You playing basketball?
- What? Yeah.
- how'd you guys do?
- We did a'ight. Still playin;
Still playin'?
When's your next game?
- We gotta play Crane. high school in Chicago.
- That's cool.
It'll be all right.
William is benched for arriving late to the locker room... and Nazareth threatens.
William enters the game to go head-to-head with Nazareth star Sean Pearson... his friend and roommate from the Nike camp.
The favored Chargers race to an early 14-point lead... in this second-round play-off game.
Give me an "E"!
Give me an "R"!
But near the end of the game...
St. Joe's begins to unravel.
William takes control.
Pearson responds. his three-point shot gives the Roadrunners their first lead of the game.
For the Chargers, their whole season may come down to this possession.
Down by one, with just over a minute remaining.
A loss tonight would be their earliest exit from the play-offs in six years.
And for William, there is no next year... no more chances to get downstate.
It ain't but one thing: bad coaching.
Bad coaching.
Well, we got him here about five minutes late.
So what? This -This ain't no time to be teaching nobody no lesson.
All right, boy.
It's all right, bro.
- You all right? You're crying, man.
- Shut up.
Yeah.
- It hurt, don't it?
- Yeah. More than ever, man.
- I didn't never want to go out this way, man.
- Your last year, man.
I'm trying to get it, man.
I'm striving for the same thing. hey, man. We'll call you.
Give me a ring. All right?
- All right.
- You played a good game, boy. All right.
You're gonna be all right.
- I love you, boy.
- I love you too, man.
All right.
William was 20 minutes late.
The team was dressed and already talking.
Then he came strolling in.
Maybe he has to learn something from that.
Even in a big game.
The game was a mirror-
It was a mirror of all of the games all year.
To quote Isiah, the toughest loss he ever took was the-
My toughest. And that was the De La Salle game in 1979 when we got beat at the buzzer.
On a 30-footer. And we were favored to win the state that year.
Um, now we look back on it as just one of those great moments in - in our high school scene.
Our toughest loss to take, and we talk about it.
So that's what I look at, you know, with these things now.
- Arthur, we could have used you tonight.
- Yeah.
Good luck.
I'm gonna be watchin'. Don't forget.
Stay in touch.
- 'Cause we've talked about -You know.
- Yeah.
- School.
- Yeah.
All right. I'm watching you score. how's your grades?
- They're all right.
- Good.
- They're all right.
- We missed you.
- I missed y'all too.
- Well, I'm proud of what you've done.
Mr. Bedford said a lot of good things about you.
- You be in touch. Okay?
- Okay. All right.
- Good luck.
- All right. You too.
Marshall's second-round opponent,
Manley, presents little challenge.
This just explains a little bit about our program... where our program's headed.
I like what you're sayin; and I want him close to home.
- Yeah.
- You know. And, uh -
I think, you know -
I'm kind of leaning your way... because I just thank God that he's getting into it - you know, somebody do want him.
I'm Tommy Travis,
Northeastern Illinois assistant coach.
- Okay. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Arthur's father.
- Arthur hester.
- Okay. Arthur hester.
Us Arts gotta stick together.
- I'm over at Kennedy-King.
- Kennedy-King?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
May the best man win.
- I thought mom was a cheerleader.
- Oh, thanks.
Thank you for the compliment. his parents seem to think he may, uh, pass the A.C.T.
- he may what?
- he may pass it.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I hope he does.
- Us Arts gotta stick together, guy.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- hey.
Would you get excited if a college coach came up and talked to you?
Not really.
Really, it's just-
You'rejust going... to another level ofbasketball. That's all.
I'll be excited when I get there.
That's when you'll be excited the whole year.
I'll be excited as soon as I step up in there - first day of practice.
If I graduate, I think I'll be the only one in my family... besides my uncle, to finish college.
Me too.
In the fourth round against heavily favored Taft...
Marshall meets their first true test of the play-offs.
But the Commandos have been bucking the odds all year.
Arthur plays one ofhis best games of the season... scoring 19 points... and the Commandos claim a spot in the city semifinals.
The final four! I told y'all he was going all the way. All the way!
Do you guys feel you can play with any team in the city?
On any given day, we can play with anybody.
We can beat anybody.
Marshall now faces the ultimate test::
King high School, the rulers of the public league.
Winners oflast year's state crown, they were labeled the best team in the country.
King has sparked controversy by out-recruiting rivals... for the biggest and best grammar school players.
We don't understand what we're really doing to these young kids.
Kid not even 12 years old... and you're baiting him to come to your school... you know, to play basketball.
Falls back in the paint.
I'm not going to start recruiting in that manner.
No, I'll probably get out of the game before then.
The winner of these two semifinal games... will play for the Chicago Public high School Basketball Championship.
King's strategy is to go inside to its two seven-foot starters.
Only Arthur seems unintimidated by theJaguars.
And King's poor play keeps the game close.
We are the... best.!
We are the team!
I think they gonna take it.
But in the second half,
King makes their move.
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Get in the game.!
King grabs a four-point lead. hey, Mookie, Mookie, Mookie!
Y'all playing with no confidence whatsoever.
None!
None.!
- All right! Go get in charge of that ball!
- Don't foul him! Don't foul him!
Let's go! Let's go!
The Commandos get aggressive on defense...
Too soon now! and use their superior speed on offense.
Players, sit down.
We got three minutes to go. Sit down.
Marshall grabs a six-point lead late in the game.
We got a long time to play.
Coach Bedford wants to force King out of their zone defense... and make their big, slow players match up man-to-man against Marshall's quick guards.
One, two, three. Defense!
Arthur simply holds the ball as the clock ticks away.
The King coach has no choice.
For the defending national champions, it's all over.
And unranked Marshall will play for the city title.
Whoo! 26-2 now!
They're 26 and 2 now.
That's my Man!
All right, Man!
- I told you we could do it.
- Yes!
- I told you we could do it.
- I told you you were gonna do it.
I knew y'all was going all the way.
I told ya.
I said, "You're going all the way. "
This is your last year.
You're going all the way. Yeah.
They got the best shot ofhim,you know.
And it's great.
That was a great shot, wasn't it?
But this one in the, uh, Tribune is what I really like.
It says,
"Arthur Agee stood as still as a statue.
Time after time was on his side. "
You know, the championship that I missed when I was in high school-
Yeah.
Twenty-one years later I got a chance at getting a championship through him.
You know, you're always trying to build your children up... and saying, "Well, you-all can do it"... but, you know, really lying on the inside a little bit, saying...
"Well, you know, you got a long haul. "
But, you know, this make you even more confidence... because if he's sure of hisself, then you know you can bank on it.
Yesterday, you know, when he won the game, you know, he told me he loved me.
And, you know, I haven't heard that in, uh -You know.
You can feel it, but I haven't heard it coming verbally from him.
In a rematch with rival Westinghouse...
Marshall proves to everybody they have what it takes to be city champs.
Inside pass. Shot rejected.
To the lane with the layin.
Busts this game wide open.
Did you see that?
Did you see it? Did you see it?
They are celebrating because they know... their high school is headed to the elite eight in Champaign.
And the Marshall Commandos have won the Public League Championship... in convincing fashion-
58-38 winners over the Westinghouse Warriors.
What's up, man?
Told you on the phone what I was gonna do.
Told you, boy.
Marshall, baby. Marshall!
Marshall!
Marshall.! Marshall.!
Marshall.! Marshall.!
Your A.C.T. came in, William, and you received a 14 for a composite... which is not high enough.
Uh,you've taken the test-
Now, this was for the fourth time.
Now, if you add all those up, it comes out to 17.2.
In order to play at Marquette, you're gonna have to get the 18.
And they're very, very concerned.
One assistant called twice this week, and Bo Ellis called today.
Smile, William.
It's not the end of the world.
- Right?
- I hope not.
Well,you gotta work at this as hard as you worked at yourjump shot.
And it was missing a lot this year.
Okay.
Now you are down to the final inning and the last strike.
We're going, going downstate!
We're going downstate!
Now let's, let's celebrate!
Now let's celebrate!
- What are we gonna be?
- State champions.!
Your Marshall Commandos.!
- Yeah!
- We're gonna take state!
Take state! Number one!
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A!
Downstate Marshall plays its familiar role as underdog... to third-ranked Batavia.
Justice has it. Justice, one-on-two.
- Spins up-
- Nice move.
In the media glare of a statewide audience, Marshall shows big-gamejitters.
Now bust out.
And Marshall missed the layup.
Sealed off,blocked by Williams.
You got easy shots.
You gotta make your easy shots.
I can't shoot for you.
Now he's gonna penetrate.
Left it for Christian. Missed the shot.
Luther Bedford looks like he's ready to commit suicide over there.
Y'all better get on your job,
Commandos!
- Now into the corner.
- Get in there.
Batavia's got these guys on the run.
One, one, one, one!
One, one, one, one.!
But in the third quarter, the Commandos charge back.
And a steal by Marshall.!
Agee gonna take it all the way.
Yes! That's the way you go!
- here we go.
- Picked him clean.
Dale. Marshall leads.
Marshall's first lead since the first quarter.
Like a lightning bolt, the Commandos have struck.
37-36, Marshall leading Batavia.
Chicago Marshall has exploded-
I always dreamed of,like... me and William taking them downstate together.
When I was at St. Joseph... maybe we could have went downstate, and maybe we couldn't.
But we did when I'm at Marshall.
Arthur's big fourth quarter helps add Batavia... to Marshall's growing list of upsets.
Spectacular comeback in the fourth quarter by the Commandos-
In the postgame news conference...
Coach Bedford labels his unranked team "the giant killers. '"
- Y'all are playing the number one team.
- We're playing the number one team.
We're playing the number two team.
This is the first time in the history of the school that we've gone this far.
- Really?
- In the history of the school.
Just like the Commandos.
See, we been the underdog.
I'm glad we are because then it just show you how you could come up.
And then you beat your opponent.
Oh,yeah.
Be a good place for Man to come.
Yeah. This is really, you know, something that a - a child would really miss out on.
Like a whole different world.
It's beyond different.
Uh-huh.
In this semifinal game, we'll see some great individuals... just as we saw many years ago.
Remember Isiah Thomas, one of the great guards. here you see the same moves he plays with in the NBA today.
Well, we've got someone like that: howard Nathan, number 34... for Peoria Manual.
Marshall got here because of one reason: quickness.
The reason: Arthur Agee.
Look at this man. he just explodes, Dan. he can get downcourt as quick as anyone I've ever seen.
In the semifinals...
Arthur goes head-to-head with howard Nathan, the all-American.
Make him work for it, Man.
Make him work for what he get.
All right! Let's go!
All the way, Man! All the way!
Yeah! That's it! That's it! That's it!
Arthur Agee, spinning inside, tough shot. Good.
Arthur has a great first half... but the Rams play even better. he's got it.
Get up for the Rams!
Everybody get up!
Get up for the Rams.!
In the second half,
Arthur tries to pick up where he left off.
Penetration move by Agee. Slapped out of there by Manual.
They've got two-on-one.
Ooh, and a nice fake and a score.
But it's the Rams who don't miss a beat... pressing the tempo against the tired Commandos.
You're not in the offense at all.
You're just out there playing individual basketball.
Completely. hey, hey, guys. No fouls.
We want to keep the clock going. Remember?
Let's go, Marshall!
Let's go!
Let's go, Marshall.!
Let's go.!
Marshall showed us last night they have the ability to come back.
Let's see what they can do here.
This is Nathan.
Nice pass.
Knock it down.
Biggest lead of the game now, and the Rams fans can smell it.
Been a great run for Luther Bedford's team.
The string of upsets stops here.
- And a foul on Agee.
- he fouls out.
But hejust never quit. hejust kept going for the basketball.
I wouldn't be surprised ifhe made the all-tournament team tonight.
- Number one!
- We're number one.!
We're still number one.
All right. All right.
Though they lose to Peoria Manual... they finish third in the state, the highest a Marshall team has finished since 1960.
This was a great season you had.
There is nothing sweeter than going downstate as a young person.
I mean, the record's gonna stay there, you know.
1991, there was a team from Marshall played.
- You know, and you're part of that.
- Yeah.
- That's part of history.
- Ah!
But for you seniors,you know-
Best wishes to all you seniors, and whatever you try to do, uh...
Mr. Williams and I will be around school... as we always are - to help you if you want to be helped, okay?
Winning five games in six days, that really takes a lot out of you.
Like Coach said,you just gotta sacrifice- you know, sacrifice everything you have.
Like, if you love the game of basketball, you just go out there and give all your heart. he got a little ways to go, but he's - he's gonna get there. hopefully he's got his head screwed on pretty good, you know... and now, you know, he's gonna be on his own to do whatever. hopefully he'll do it right.
When we got down here, people don't expect -
"Marshall? how'd they get down here?"
They lookin' like: "Who they got on their team?"
I had to come out and prove myself.
I think I could play Division I basketball.
'Cause all I need is just a scholarship.
That's -That's all I'm looking for.
Arthur Agee.
All right!
All this area through here is our new computer labs.
We'll take you through all those rooms.
Arthur's first recruiting visit... takes him to a junior college in Southern Missouri.
The strength that I see here is the tremendous teaching that goes on here. have you decided what you want to go into?
Uh, communications.
Are you more interested in the overall communications -
That, and, uh -
I like that and accounting.
- Like business.
- Oh. Okay.
We enjoy winning things, but the primary purpose is your education.
What are some of your career goals, may I ask?
I want to fall back to, like, make - have my own business.
Like real estate.
This is where it all happens.
Beautiful place.
And it gets to rockin;
- You gonna try it on there?
- Yeah.
Those are about $ 120 apiece.
You need to be very careful with this decision.
You know, if you come in and act right, you're going out ofhere... with two years of your college finished... a scholarship to a Division I university.
Exactly where you'd want to be- on track to graduate in four years.
Mineral Area doesn't have dorms... but it does have a basketball house.
All the ballplayers on scholarship live here.
Get your ass up, nigga.
Of the seven blacks in the entire school... six live in this house.
You come in and look at this little house, then after a while you get used to it.
Try to make a little home, you know. home away from home anyway.
We hang around each other most of the time.
We know who to trust, who not to trust.
I just want to go somewhere where I'm gonna play.
I can get the grades.
I love basketball. how many of your players that leave there and they end up going to a four-year college?
- Thirty-one sophomores in a row.
- Really?
Every last one of'em he coached.
- hi. how you doing?
- hey. how you doing?
- Arthur Sr.
- Bo and Sheila have been separated.
She asked him to return today over Arthur's objections.
I'll show you exactly what the scholarship entails.
Is this a full scholarship for the two years?
The reason I'm skeptical is because of the promises that was made in the past.
From the time he comes down there until he leaves, you will not have a financial need.
Now, when you make this decision... you got to live and die with it.
'Cause it's your decision to make.
Now, I'm here to support you if you - if you done searched this whole thing.
And it's what you really want.
Not,you know,
'cause Mama said this or your dad-
Or because you're saving
Mama money, because if we have to... we will still pay- if you have to try to pay- if we can put some-
I'm just sayin;
You - Understand what you're saying.
You want to save somebody money, but still -
But you have to still do what is best from here.
But still we want the best for you - even if you have to - or we have to go in the hole, you know.
You understand what I'm saying? I'm just saying.
But still, the decision is up to you.
So, what do you think?
Ah.
- Ready to sign it?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
- Let's do it up.
- What time is it?
Come on, Bo.
Whip it to him.
When I was 23, how old was he?
And I whupped him then.
Aw!
You want to see it rain?
Let it rain.!
- You want to see it rain?
- One more time.
Let it rain!
You want to see it rain?
Let it rain!
Oh!
Peoria Manual.
Remember what they did to you now.
Yeah. Do you know howard Nathan?
And I strung him up, just like that.
Uh-oh. Like father, like son.
What's up with that?
You better stick to church music, leave that basketball alone. hell, no. You can't do that.
Foul! Foul!
Foul. Foul, foul, foul.
- That's 32.
- That's 34.
- That didn't count 'cause he called "Bo. "
- That's 34!
- That's 32!
- he didn't hit nothing else.!
- I did!
- he didn't hit nothing else!
- It's 34-28, Bo.
- Bo's a sore loser.
- All right!
- No. I know how to count though.
- Ain't no con game. I'm older now.
- Yeah.
- Ain't no con game going on no more.
- No more. Ain't no more.
- The score is 32 to 28.
Now, you can play for 32 if you want to.
Game over with.
I can con too.
Losers quit. I'm ready to play.
Now,youse a coward if you don't-
Check ball.
- You're mad now.
- Check ball.
- Throw it over there.
- You ain't two years old.
You ain't gettin' no pacifier.
- Give me that.
- Yeah.
Your mama ain't here to give you this ball. Let's go.
- Give me the rock.
- Let's make it rain. Make it rain.
Bang. Bang. Right there. ha! Go sit down.
Go sit down.
Bo, it's raining.!
Bo, it's raining.
- It's raining, Bo!
- It's raining, Bo!
You're on punishment when you get home.
You're on punishment when you get home.
And you're on punishment when you get home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
It's gonna rain on your head, Bo.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen... and welcome to St. Joseph's
Annual Basketball Awards Dinner.
We had a... difficult year.
Most of you are aware of that.
When I first went to St. Joe's,
I really did sleep, eat and drink basketball.
That was all I did.
But it became more of a job than a sport to play.
Things here have not changed since-
You know, Coach Pingatore just had these dreams in his head. hejust wanted me to go the same route he took Isiah.
The most steals. he played as a freshman.
Not even Isiah was a four-year starter.
You know, basketball was just like- he was possessed with it.
You know, it was his life.
And he wanted it to be everybody else's life too.
All-conference in the SCC.
All-state in the Sun-Times.
A McDonald All-American nomination.
M. V.P., 1990-1991 season,
William Gates.
When I had some real problems...
I couldn't go to none of them about it.
You know, I was having some problems with Catherine's family and my family... and I said, you know, "Coach Pingatore, their family's been getting on me about... you know, I'm not doing this, and I'm not doing that. "
And the only thing
Coach Pingatore could say is...
"Write 'em off. "
That was all he told me.
And I was, like, "What kind of advice is that?"
Well, how's it feel to be finishing?
Uh, I mean-
Now, don't say anything you don't mean, William.
I mean, I'm serious, Coach.
I enjoyed my four years.
I mean, we had our run-ins, and, uh -
- Who had run-ins?
- Me and you.
- We did?
- Yeah. Like that time you made me run 75 stairs.
- I never f-
- You never forgot that.
Never.
See,you should have been happy and enthusiastic about doing your punishment.
But someday you're gonna learn that, uh... everything that was done was for your benefit.
So that you can come back four years from now and say, "Coach,you were right.
"Everything that happened at St. Joe's helped me a lot... and as a result I got a degree. '"
That's what I'm hoping for.
I'm going into communication... so when you start asking for a donation,
I'll know the right way to turn you down.
I'm sure you'll never turn us down.
Ah.
I never really felt that he bought into the system. he was never convinced what he was doing was the right thing to do.
But overall he had a good career- not a great career.
It's never good-bye.
Could've been different if the injury didn't occur.
But it did occur.
- And that was the big difference.
- I'm proud of what you did.
- Okay.
- I expect you to do a lot better.
I don't want this to be the-
- Yeah.
- You know, the highlight of your career.
You've got a lot of bigger and better things to do.
I'll see you later.
Good luck.
Well... another one walks out the door, and another one comes in the door.
That's what it's all about.
It came through for me.
- Got the score I needed.
- All right.
And, hey...
I'm eligible.
You know, this is one of the greatest feelings in the world. That's about it.
I mean -
After five attempts,
William's composite score of 17.5... is rounded up to 18... and he can finally accept a scholarship to play at Marquette.
I think my mom... all through high school really, really was proud of me.
She said, "Everybody's throwing their dreams into you... but you got to throw your own dreams into yourself. '"
When I gave her the diploma after the graduation... she was, like,
"This is it, one of my proudest moments. '"
My baby graduated.
Curtis always wanted to go to Marquette... and his grades weren't good enough for him to go... and now it's like he got the grades,you know?
Excuse me, Curtis.
You gonna give anybody else a chance?
What two countries are we competing with for world trade?
Before Arthur can graduate, he must pass summer school.
And for the first time in three years,
Shannon isn't there with him.
The other country, of course, we said- he thought he could sell drugs and don't get caught,you know.
But he found out the hard way.
And I told him, while he was doing all that -
I wasn't hanging with Shannon then.
I was like, man, "Shannon, you should stop, man.
Stop doing that stuff. "
We always said we weren't gonna never do no stufflike that.
We werejust gonna go on and graduate and go on to college.
But,you know, he had to be the one.
One week before his graduation,
Arthur is robbed at gunpoint.
At first I thought he was gonna shoot me because I didn't have no money.
'Cause he kept asking me, "You got -
You got some money. Where your wallet at?"
Be like, "What you driving a car like this for?"
I was, like, "I ain't got no wallet. "
And then,you know, he grabbed me and stuff,and I was- and I was about to panic and stuff, and I just calmed down.
I sit down and had a long talk with him and his sister.
Someone pulled a pistol on her right down the street from the house.
I said, "Do you all understand what is going on out here in these streets today?'"
Even with me, when I was out there - you know, out there strung out - you know, I looked for somebody that seemed like they had something. hmm. After this, I -
I - I'm ready.
I'm ready to leave.
'Cause there ain't no -
Everybody up here going to jail or- or either in drugs.
Or dead.
James Davis.
Arthur Agee.
Please hold your applause so everyone can hear.
Christine Bowman.
Erica Byrd.
Sandra Crockett.
I never thought he would get to the place where he's at now.
Arthur's self-esteem was really drained from St. Joseph's.
I said, "Well,you are somebody.
"No matter where you go, it's what you have in your heart... that you're gonna go somewhere. '"
Come on.
Move out of the way, boy.
Everybody out there, there's gonna be a party tonight. There's gonna be a party tonight.
You know it.
These flame-broiled burgers -
It's scary, man. I'm telling you.
I'm telling you the truth.
Scary generation, man.
- I thought you might hit me in my head, fool.
- I didn't hit you in your head.
To my son.
I hope you pursue all your dreams and your desires... that you have within you.
I love you very much.
- Ooh, that is so nice.
- Whatever.
Oh, no.!
God, we thank you for this day, Lord.
And we ask you to go with junior, Lord.
And we thank you, Lord. Go with him as he try to better his education, Lord.
And we thank you for him for coming this far.
We came this far by faith, Lord.
And we ask you, Father, when he get in college, Lord... to keep him, Lord- keep him protected.
We thank you for him,Jesus.
- In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
- Amen.
Oh,you can cry like a river, girl.
You're crying so bad,
I won't even make fun of you.
Oh, God.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.
I want you to be good, okay?
And don't, uh, get mixed up in none of that old stuff that, uh, you know.
I done told you what to do.
Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers.
None of that stuff.
Bye-bye.
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.
Once he get in the door,
I want him to stay in there for four years.
Think he gonna make it?
You do?
I think he gonna make it.
Well, I hope so anyway.
When I was young- When I was little, that's all I used to think about- the NBA.
If I set my mind, I can - I can go.
I can st - I can go.
Get in good college. I can go.
But if I don't, you know, I ain't gonna be no drug dealer, you know... cry about it, come back and, you know... stick up gas stations or nothing like that, you know.
Probably go into comedian or architecture, something like that.
You don't think that you'll have the kind of tough times like your dad's been through?
No.
I can't say- I can't say that I will.
I can't say that I don't. I don't know.
Four years ago, that's all
I used to dream about was playing in the NBA.
I don't really dream about it like that anymore.
You know, even though...
I love playing basketball, but, you know...
I want to do other things with my life too.
- Say, "hi, Daddy. '"
- hi, Daddy.
- "how you doing?'"
- how you doing?
- Say, "I love you. '"
- I love you.
If I had to stop playing basketball right now, I think I'd still be happy.
- I think I would.
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Where'd Daddy get to?
- Uh, Marquette.
Marquette?
That's why when somebody say,you know...
"When you get to the NBA, don't forget about me,
'"and all that stuff...
I should say to them,
"Well, if I don't make it, watch you don't forget about me. '"
Everybody seems to be ready.
Are you ready?
For the first time in three years, the greatest rock 'n 'roll band in the world, the Rolling Stones!
The Rolling Stones!!
We're gonna have a look at you.
We're gonna see how beautiful you are.
All right!
Oh, New York City, you talk a lot.
Let's have a look at you.
Let's have a look at New York City.
Well, all right!
Welcome to the breakfast show.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're just gonna wake up.
Well, all right!
Charlie's good tonight, isn't he?
I think you really-- you really dressed up tonight.
Aren't they?
We'd like to see how you look.
Can we see how they look?
Let's have a look how they look.
Come on.
Oh, we just want to see how they look.
Ohhh, we couldn't see you!
We couldn't see you.
It's really hard to see this together, isn't it?
It will take time.
- What?
- Eight weeks.
Eight weeks.
Eight weeks.
Do you think you can do it that quick?
This gives us the freedom.
All you guys watching us.
We may only be on you for a minute, then go to almost anything.
This is Stefan Ponek,
KSAN Radio, San Francisco.
Well, the Rolling Stones' tour of the United States is over.
They wound it up with a free concert at the Altamont Speedway for more than 300,000 people.
There were four births, four deaths and an awful lot of scuffles reported.
We received word that someone was stabbed to death... in front of the stage by a member of the Hell's Angels.
Nothing's confirmed on that.
We were there.
We didn't see it, but we did see a lot.
We want to know what you saw.
Our phones are open.
We'd like to hear from you. What was the Altamont free concert like?
The Angels did as they saw best in the difficult situation.
As far as I'm concerned, they were people who were here... who tried to help in their own way.
- Right? You know?
- Hmm. Right.
If people didn't dig it,
I'm sorry.
That was Sam Cutler, one of the organizers of the free concert.
I think we've got one of the Hell's Angels on the line.
Sonny Barger.
Have I got that right, Sonny?
- Yeah.
- Okay, what's up?
I didn't go there to police nothing, man.
I ain't no cop. I ain't never gonna pretend to be a cop.
And this Mick Jagger, like-- put it all on the Angels, man.
Like, he used us for dupes, man.
And as far as I'm concerned, we were the biggest suckers for that idiot that I can ever see.
And you know what?
They told me... if I could sit on the edge of the stage... so nobody would climb over me, you know,
I could drink beer until the show was over.
That's what I went there to do.
But you know what?
When they started messing over our bikes, they started it.
I don't know if you think we pay $50 for them things... or steal them or pay a lot for them or what.
Ain't nobody gonna kick my motorcycle.
And they might think because they're in a crowd of 300,000 people... that they can do it and get away with it.
But when you're standing there, looking at something that's your life, and everything you've got is invested in that thing, and you love that thing better than anything in the world, and you see a guy kick it, you know who he is.
You're gonna get him.
And you know what? They got got.
I am not no peace creep by any sense of the word.
And you can call them people flower children and this and that.
Some of them people was loaded on some drugs... that it's just too bad we wasn't loaded on... because they come running up the hill, yelling "Aaaah" and jump on somebody.
And it wasn't even always jumping on Angels.
But when they jumped on an Angel, they got hurt.
Well done, Sonny.
I think I remember him.
Do you?
No, I'm not certain.
I don't really remember what he looked like.
There was a couple of them before we went on.
They were really very nice, you know?
A couple of them guys.
It's just, uh--
I don't know.
I mean, the way they cleared the path, for instance, was incredible.
Were you there? Was you in the party that had to be led to the stage?
- My goodness.
- I saw what they did, yeah.
That was insane.
What did they do?
Well, it's just the way they did it, you know?
It's very, very--
'Cause before that,
I didn't really think there was anything going on, you know?
Really. I didn't hear anything
'cause we were right at the side.
Oh, dear, what a shame!
KSAN Radio here. The violence at Altamont was completely unexpected.
The Rolling Stones had performed for overflow audiences... without incident in major cities across the United States.
Okay, roll it.
Thank you.
Well, all right.
Well, all right!
Well, all right!
Well, all right!
Are you any more satisfied as far as your career goes?
Do you mean sexually or, or philosophically?
- Both.
- Yeah, we're more satisfied now sexually, aren't--
How about philosophically and financially?
Financially dissatisfied, uh, you know.
Uh, sexually satisfied, philosophically trying.
- Rubbish.
- There's a question here on the right.
I read in one of the papers that you'll be giving... a free concert in San Francisco.
We are doing a free concert in San Francisco.
- When?
- On December 6.
And, uh, the location is not
Golden Gate Park, unfortunately, but it's somewhere adjacent to it which is a bit larger.
It's creating sort of a microcosmic society, you know, which sets the example to the rest of America... as to how one can behave in large gatherings.
This is Mel Belli, the lawyer in San Francisco.
Uh, I'm-I'm talking for the Rolling Stones.
We've got their managers and their principals here.
I've just heard that you've offered them your speedway... for their performance on Saturday, is that right?
- That is correct.
- This is an open phone so we can all talk on it.
What I'm trying to find out is what we can do to do this concert.
For the last 36 hours, I've stood my organization on its ear, Mr. Belli.
I don't know anything about this.
I'm coming in late and trying to straighten something out.
So tell me exactly what it is without--
Yeah. My first area of policy concern:
I do not want this gesture... on the part of Mr. Jagger... to cost me five cents.
If a blade of grass is torn down, they are going to build it up again, you know?
I was involved in Woodstock.
I've represented rock groups, and I've been involved, both as an attorney and as an executive, with festivals.
No matter what anybody tells you, they're a pain in the ass.
Don't turn me into a proctologist.
Just tell me what I can do here.
Well, somebody tell me why I should want to get this concert going.
Are you trying to make it so they can't do this?
No, I want it to happen, but I'm not prepared to rebuild my goddamn racetrack.
Will you come up and see if you can work with me on this thing?
I'd love to work with you, Mr. Belli, but are you working with Mr. Jagger?
I haven't met Mr. Jagger.
I've only met these other people here.
- Have you met Mr. Schneider?
- Yes, he's right here in the office.
All right, fine.
He knows what happened at our meeting this afternoon.
Then call me back and with the thought... see if you could come up tomorrow morning.
- You and I can see what we can do with this damn thing.
- Okay.
All right, call me back.
There's no way to do the concert except in that location.
As it stands now, you're gonna have at least 100,000 kids there by Saturday.
You don 't have any alternative.
The only thing you can do... is to do an affidavit, temporary restraining order and talk to one of the judges.
So that brings us down to this.
Um, I'll call one of the judges right now.
That's your only chance of forcing these people to do it.
Now, don't scare off from these people.
If I were advising them,
I'd tell them to hide out.
Because right when they're coming out, you'll-- sh-ta-boom!
- Yeah, but it doesn't come in till the solo.
- I know, I know.
- What is that?
- What?
- Stickin' out of your pocket.
- Cousin Minnie says,
"How delicious!"
I'm taking it home for Robert.
Y'all come back now, ya hear?
That's one more song.
That should be it.
I found it. I found it.
Anybody in?
Is my local groupie in?
Hello, darling.
How are you?
When are the bags coming up, Ronnie?
Stew's gotta get 46 pieces up.
We're gonna do--
We're gonna do a slow blues for you now, people.
You like that?
I like it.
This thing is going on.
The Chronicle is coming out with a story that it's off.
- This has been building up for a long time.
- Well, it's off and on.
Everybody wants a piece of the pie.
All right, let's see if we can get some facts... to build together on an affidavit here.
So we'll have that available and then a very short order to show cause.
The sheriff wants to know who's going to go to the bathroom and where.
They've got a nice little bucolic community there--
They know practically when every john is flushed... and the orderly habits of the bathroom of all of their, uh, voters.
Dick Carter's on the line.
He's offering us the speedway at Altamont.
Hello, Dick.
This is Mel Belli for the Stones.
If they were to perform in the speedway, is the speedway open so that they can be seen... from the people that can't get in?
I'm sure we can work something out.
I want the publicity.
You want the publicity?
Well, you take the publicity.
The Rolling Stones don't want any money.
It's for charity.
- So I'll take the money.
- All right.
All right.
Well, why don't I do this?
Why don't I talk with these people here... and then I'll get back with you... and then if we have to sign anything up... and if you need any insurance, which I'm sure you will want, and all the rest of that stuff,
I'll work with you in the morning.
- Okay.
- I'll call you back later, after I talk with them, Dick.
Bye. He's offered the Altamont Speedway.
- There's not enough room.
- There's not time to move it.
We got to tear down a stage and the scaffolding.
The phones are in. The generators are there. Everything is left to go.
It's anticipated that the amount of kids now traveling across country-- you may have anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 kids... starting to arrive sometime tomorrow.
They're all lining up at the airports from as far away as New York.
- Now? You gotta be kidding.
- You have no idea what goes on here.
It's an amazing phenomenon.
It's like the lemmings of the sea.
- Mike Lang is on the line.
- Yeah, Mike?
John says that he doesn't think you can make it over there at the Altamont Speedway.
- Do you want to talk directly to Mike?
- Yeah.
Mike, I got the impression from everybody where you are... that there was no way of moving to that speedway.
We can do it.
Nobody wants to, but if we have to, we can.
Just a quick question.
You were at Woodstock, and you've now been to Altamont?
- Right.
- How does it stack up?
Do you have the room?
I think we have the room, sure.
I think we can hold as many people as want to come.
Can you change locations that fast?
We had a much bigger operation to change at Woodstock.
I don't think we'll have much problem.
We're just dealing with a free concert.
That's what we want to present.
And I think that's what the Stones are up to. They want to play here.
Is this going to be Woodstock West?
Well, it's going to be San Francisco.
Do you have any special feelings about this kind of a concert?
This spontaneous, free--
Well, it's not so much--
I don't think it's a complete concert.
The concert is just--
I think it's an excuse.
You know, because, like, the thing is, it's just like everyone coming and having a good time.
The concert's like the proscenium of a theater.
It's like an excuse for everyone to just sort of, you know, get together... and, like, talk to each other and sleep with each other... ball each other and get very stoned... and just have a nice night out and a good day, you know?
- I mean, do you understand?
- I do.
It's not just like getting up there and seeing... the Grateful Airplane and the Rolling, Rolling Dead.
And now, Ike and Tina Turner.
Thank you.
I don't know what they paid for them-- the costumes-- but is there any way--
Good. It's nice to have a chick occasionally.
Far out.
Sorry you had to wait.
Oh, yeah!
Thank you kindly.
I think I busted a button on my trousers.
Hope they don't fall down.
It's that jumping around.
I'll have to do it up again.
Whoo! You don't want my trousers to fall down now, do you?
We're gonna--
We're gonna kiss you good-bye.
And we leave you to kiss each other good-bye.
- Hello?
- Yes, Mel?
- Yes, we still have you.
- I got you in an echo.
Think you can pick it up?
I'm practicing. I'm going on first before the Rolling Stones.
Can we get you to pick up the phone like before?
Well, what it is now, we're waiting for Mr. Carter to come in.
But I've just had a letter read to me... where he said that he very definitely... wants the Stones and the concert there.
So, as of this minute, we're intending that the show go on.
They have 200,
300 people working... and it's going to be quite a problem to get the thing set up at the Altamont Speedway.
But it will be, and it will start at 10:00.
Now, that's where we stand.
I'm waiting for Mr. Carter now.
Uh, let me ask and see.
Are the Rolling Stones all in town?
- Not yet. They're coming tonight.
- They're coming in tonight.
But everybody's ready, and they're all set to go.
That's where we are.
Is this Mr. Carter?
Sheriff, Mr. Carter just came in.
Now, could we talk a little bit?
I can put this on the box so that we can all hear.
And I think, to start,
Mr. Carter has expressed... his willingness to have this on his private property over there.
But the question is of this narrow road to come in there.
Do you foresee any problems on that?
Well, that basically is the Highway Patrol's problem, and they foresee problems.
How many cars can Mr. Carter park on his property?
150 cars per acre?
150 cars per acre times 80 acres.
- How many?
- 150 times 80.
- 12,000 automobiles.
Well, up in Tallalamee County, they estimated they had 80,000 cars.
What are we going to do with them?
There's much open area around there.
I can probably arrange with other landowners.
There's one adjoining me that has 2,000 acres.
Yes, well, we have some of the adjoining landowners complaining before it's even granted.
If there's 50,000 cars that Mr. Carter can 't park, we're in trouble.
8:38 now at KFRC.
This is Frank Terry, and let me repeat:
The Rolling Stones' free concert is going to be on tomorrow at Altamont Speedway.
Apparently, it's one of the most difficult things to give a free concert.
As you all know, the concert was originally scheduled for Golden Gate Park... and then at the Sears Point Raceway.
Many, many volunteers went out to Sears Point... in trucks, cars, trailers, everything, packed up all the gear out there and took it to the Altamont Speedway... where they are right now, in the cold, 30-degree weather, setting up the stage, setting up the generators... the sound equipment and the facilities for the people.
We're gonna end it now.
Good-bye.
Well, all right!
We got to go!
We got to go!
We got to go!
We got to go!
They hit Mick. Somebody hit him.
- Come on over.
- I hate you!
Keith!
Do you think he'll be coming out?
Oh, Mickey, Mickey,
Mickey, Mickey.
I can't function. I've been on the scaffolding almost all night.
I can't close my hands. They're formed to the shape of the scaffolding.
You people that are hanging on that scaffolding, you're rendering that scaffold unsafe by climbing on it.
Those scaffoldings are not built to take very heavy weight.
So if we could have some sort of reason, whatever that might be, we'd be very pleased.
Arthur, in between moving around, always turn that off.
Turn it off and turn it on.
Look, you've got to be very cool with that little thing.
Even though it's supposed to be electrically correct, man, you got to really think right around it.
Are you gonna hear some music today?
Hey, you want me to just leave this in here?
No.
Hashish.
Hashish.
L.S.D.
Psilocybin.
Hashish.
Make them comfortable.
Even this parking situation back here, it's all wrong, but that's the way the kids park.
For once, we're just gonna let it happen.
For experimental purposes.
You know what I mean?
So be as easy on this as we can.
It won't hurt the Stones in any way.
Wow!
Wow, but I wanna be smart, but you're just so far out.
Because... yeah!
They should be back when they discover we're not with them.
Since we've got the beer and the food, they'll find us.
Well, a guy's freaking out over at the tent there--
So, tough shit.
What do you mean, tough shit?
The guy's really freaking out.
Keep-Keep your--
No, I don't mean tough shit.
What I mean is that... if you lay successive numbers of bums on this crowd, by the time 6:00 comes around, they're gonna be in a real mood.
I'm not prepared to stand here laying bum trips--
Up at Woodstock this was done, and you were there, and you know.
And announcements were made.
We're just sort of getting there, basically.
If we make it.
I've been falling a lot lately.
Let's go this way.
Whoa! When did this happen?
There's already a doctor over there.
A chick's having a baby.
She's having a baby.
Contributions to Panther Defense Fund.
Contributions to the Panther Defense Fund.
They're trying to either wipe out the Panther party... by jailing all the members and wiping them out economically, financially, or violently through killing them.
After all, they're just-- they're just Negroes, you know?
Need that cannon pretty bad.
We just had our first baby born at Carter's Altamont Speedway.
Yeah, right, yes.
- Just had our first baby born.
- Oh, wow.
Okay so far.
Everything's all right.
- We have a helicopter standing by.
- Can we get a mike?
If the press will push this:
Dick Carter's Altamont Speedway, not just Altamont Speedway.
This cat right over here.
He just told me to do it, man.
No, well, I'm sorry.
Nobody else goes there except me.
I'd really like you to get off the stage, baby, please.
Okay, well, I can dig that.
- Thanks very much.
- Uh-huh.
The American Red Cross has asked us to secure these supplies.
If anyone has any of these things to contribute.
We need Ace bandages.
Ace bandages, gauze and sponges.
If you have any of that equipment, please bring it to the medical tent... or to the Golden Gate Chapter
Disaster Service Red Cross truck.
Excuse me.
Which way is the stage?
Around the corner?
You mean that way?
I think we're in pretty good shape, though, right now.
We're in chaos backstage.
We'll never get--
That's gonna have to be cleared,
'cause the group's gotta come in.
What we need to do is start getting some blokes together--
The essence of it, as far as I'm concerned, is this is where the work has gotta go.
- Right.
- Sling them all out.
No fucking about. We've had enough of being polite. Get out, go away.
- I've asked. I know.
- So if you could help us, that would be groovy.
- Sure.
- All these people, you know?
I want to see Mick Jagger, goddamn it. No!
Can I say just one thing before you take her off?
- Just let me say one thing.
- I will not!
Hey, before you go away, man.
Don't tell me what to say, okay?
You look after your job, baby, and I'll look after mine.
You're trying to stop me.
I'm trying to ask you--
Will you ask all these people that are milling around if they'd move to the side, man.
He wants to listen to you.
- You want a bong?
- She wants to get fucked.
That's the way!
You don't belong here, man.
- Let me have some of that.
- I wanna get up on stage.
The organizers, who number about 20 people, would really like to thank the hundreds of people who came out here last night... and worked all night to get this on.
Thanks to everybody who helped.
And I'd like to point out to everybody here... that this can be the greatest party of 1969 that we've had.
Let's have a party, and let's have a good time.
The Flying Burrito Brothers!
Please stop hurting each other.
Please stop hurting each other.
You don't have to.
Take him out the other side!
Take him out the other side!
Hey, man, quit crowding.
Just back off.
We need a doctor under the left-hand scaffold... as soon as possible, please.
They're not gonna play music till we get a doctor.
Somebody help.
Somebody's hurt!
Marianne Faithfull is here.
You feel like signing a few albums?
Let me have that album.
Where's that album?
Thank you.
Well, I'm not stepping outside.
- I don't blame you.
- I am. I want to.
-Just sign this.
- But I can't get very far.
Sign this, please.
Sign this one too.
Hey, what about the free records and all the rest of the shit?
There are a number of people on and around this stage who should not be here.
Consequently-- Consequently, the musicians on this stage... are playing with something like
200 people breathing down their necks.
Now, can I please ask that everyone leaves the stage... and, as I say, we'll go back to playing music and nothing else.
The Jefferson Airplane.
Jefferson Airplane.
Easy!
Easy!
Easy.
Easy. Easy.
Easy. Easy.
Easy.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Yeah, it's all right.
It's kind of weird up here.
Hey, man, I'd like to mention that the Hell's Angels... just smashed Marty Balin in the face and knocked him out for a bit.
I'd like to thank you for that.
There's other ways--
Hey, wait. Is this on?
- You're talkin' to me,
I'm gonna talk to you.
- I'm not talking to you.
You're talking to my people.
Let me tell you what's happenin'.
You is what happenin'!
Hey! Oh!
- No! No!
- Watch it. Hold it.
- No, stop it!
- You know what's happening?
- What's happening?
- We're partying like you.
No! No!
Um, you know, that's really stupid.
Hey, man, you guys don't have to stay on the stage.
They're not gonna hassle us.
- Hey.
- They're not really that--
That's really not worth it.
You don't hassle with anybody in particular.
You gotta keep your bodies off each other unless you intend love.
People get weird, and you need people like the Angels to keep people in line.
But the Angels also--
You know, you don't bust people in the head for nothing.
So both sides are, uh, fucking up temporarily.
Let's not keep fuckin' up!
- Oh, that's what the story is here?
- Yeah.
- Oh, bummer.
- Really bad. I mean, like, it's scary.
- Who's doing all the beating?
- Hell's Angels.
- Hell's Angels are beating on musicians?
- Marty got beat up.
- A fight on the stage.
- Doesn't seem right, man.
It's really weird, man.
It's really weird.
- Oh, man! Really?
- There's lots of people.
Get that cleared!
Let's get it!
Oh, babies.
There's so many of you.
Just be cool down in front and don't push around.
Just keep still.
Keep together.
Oh, yeah.
Hey! Hey!
Hey, Keith, Keith, Keith!
Keith, will you cool it, and I'll try and stop it.
Hey, hey, people.
Sisters.
Brothers and sisters.
Brothers and sisters, come on now.
That means everybody just cool out!
Will you cool out, everybody?
- A fight broke out.
- I know. I'm hip.
Everybody be cool now.
Come on.
All right?
How are we doing over there?
All right?
Can we still make it down the front?
Is there anyone there that's hurt? Huh?
Everyone all right?
Okay?
All right, I think we are cool.
We can do--
We're always having--
Something very funny happens when we start that number.
I need to get down with it now.
All right!
Uh, people, who's fighting, what for?
Who's fighting, and what for?
Why are we fighting?
Why are we fighting?
We don't want to fight.
Come on!
Do we want--
Who wants to fight?
Who is it?
Hey, you know, I mean--
Every other scene has been cool. Let--
Look, that guy there, if he doesn't stop it, man--
Listen, either those cats cool it, or we don't play.
- Come on.
- You gonna stop?
We need a doctor!
If you don't cool it, you ain't gonna hear no music!
Now, you wanna all go home or what?
We need doctors down here now, please.
Can we have a doctor down here now to the front?
I-I cannot see what's going on.
I just know that every time... we get to a number, something happens.
I don't know what's going on, who's doing what.
It's just a scuffle.
All I can ask you,
San Francisco, is like the whole thing.
Like, this could be the most beautiful evening... we've had for this winter, you know, and we've really--
Why don't-- Don't fuck it up, man.
Come on, let's get it together.
I can't do any more than just ask you, beg you, just to keep it together.
You can do it.
It's within your power.
Everyone, Hell's Angels, everybody, let's just keep ourselves together.
You know, if we are all one, let's show we're all one.
- Preach it, brother!
- Up on the scaffold. Urgently, man.
There's one thing horrible that we need.
Sam, we need an ambulance.
We need a doctor by that scaffold there.
If there's a doctor, can he get to there?
Okay, here we go. We're gonna--
I don't know what we're doing.
When we get to really the end and we all want to go absolutely crazy, and, like, jump on each other, then we'll stand up again.
You know what I mean?
Everyone keep-- sit down.
I mean, just keep cool, and let's just relax.
Let's just get into the groove.
Come on, we can get it together.
Come on. Sit down.
Hey, man, look. We're splitting.
If those cats can't--
If you people-- We're splitting if those cats don't stop beating everybody up in sight.
I want them out of the way, man.
I don't like you--
A guy's got a gun out here, and he's shooting at the stage.
- It's one guy.
- He's got a gun.
Hey, people.
Hey, people.
Come on, let's be cool.
People, please.
There's no reason to hassle anybody.
Please don't permit it.
If you move back and sit down, we can continue and we will continue.
Can you roll back on that, David?
Sure.
Did you see what was happening there?
No, you couldn't see anything.
Well, it was another scuffle.
There's the Angel right there, with a knife.
- Where's the gun?
- I'll roll it back.
You'll see it against the girl's crocheted dress.
Right there, isn't it?
Oh, it's so horrible.
Is there an officer?
Is there a policeman here?
- What happened here, anyway?
- Man, he pulled out a gun.
- He did?
- Yes, the Hell's Angels took the gun away from him.
One of them has it now.
He showed it to me.
And they proceeded to put him down on the ground and started kicking him.
And he has a couple of stab wounds in his back and one over his ear.
We tried to keep him alive, but when we got here, the doctor checked him out and that was it.
We pronounced him dead at about 6:20.
We have a request from the state police.
- I don't want him to die!
Don't let him die, please!
- He won't die!
Now, they're gonna do everything in their power.
- But they can't hear his heart.
- Now, don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
- They're gonna put him in this whirlybird and take--
- I have to go with him.
Get back, please.
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
Oh, yeah!
Come on in!
All right.
See you all.
All right.
{842}{919}Michael Fish takes a late|look at the weather.
{920}{953}Again, a good deal of cloud.
{954}{1015}A little rain from time to time|for much of the day,
{1016}{1097}but later on that rain is going|to become ever more persistent
{1098}{1135}and eventually,|I think that rain
{1136}{1193}will probably turn out to be|fairly heavy.
{1263}{1349}What you've seen in any|documentary about any band,
{1350}{1450}before or since, is how great|and wonderful everything is.
{1451}{1552}It's not the truth of it.|It's hell, it's hard.
{1553}{1672}It's horrible.|It's enjoyable to a small degree
{1673}{1733}but if you know what you're|doing it for,
{1734}{1776}you'll tolerate all that
{1777}{1869}because the work, at the end|of the day, is what matters.
{1869}{1920}We managed to offend
{1921}{2006}all the people we were|fucking fed up with.
{2549}{2652}The Labour Party, who'd promised|so much after the war
{2653}{2764}had done so little|for the working class
{2765}{2889}that the working class were|confused about even themselves
{2890}{3003}and didn't even understand what|working class meant anymore.
{3004}{3053}It was cold and miserable.
{3054}{3119}No one had anyjobs.|You couldn't get ajob.
{3120}{3169}Everyone was on the dole.
{3194}{3250}If you weren't born|into money,
{3251}{3309}then you might as well have kissed|your fucking life goodbye,
{3310}{3363}you weren't gonna amount|to anything.
{3364}{3426}The germ, the seed|of the Sex Pistols
{3427}{3493}generated from that.
{3633}{3704}Now is the winter|of our discontent
{3705}{3838}made glorious summer --|by this sun of York.
{4008}{4090}England was in a state|of social upheaval.
{4091}{4183}It was a very, very|different time.
{4184}{4241}Total social chaos.
{4241}{4309}There was rioting|all over the place.
{4310}{4357}You have to join|the picket line.
{4358}{4429}There were strikes on every kind|of amenity you could think of.
{4430}{4480}Pound power.
{4481}{4563}The TV channels would|go on and off randomly.
{4595}{4689}People were fed up|with the old way.
{4690}{4764}The old way was clearly|not working.
{4829}{4874}There's a little bit|sticking up there.
{4875}{4932}You can see it|in the reflection.
{4933}{4996}Ultra Bright|gets you noticed.
{5083}{5148}You're told at school,|you're told at the job center,
{5149}{5241}you're told by everyone|that you don't stand a chance.
{5280}{5374}And you should just accept|your lot, and get on with it.
{5400}{5459}That's where you're gonna get|the social strife.
{5460}{5530}Hate and war...|and race hate.
{5740}{5797}When you feel powerless...
{5798}{5878}you will grab any power|you can...
{5879}{5960}to retain some kind|of self-respect.
{6009}{6064}Want something on how many|people have been mugged?
{6065}{6142}Don't lay your hand on me...|I'll break your fucking jaw!
{6143}{6228}That man is sad|'cause he's misinformed,
{6229}{6290}and he's misled,|and he's used.
{6291}{6361}Yes -- I am a racialist.|And why?
{6361}{6410}Who's made me a racialist?
{6411}{6480}This government --|the conservatives,
{6481}{6561}and every stingy,|stinking councillor
{6561}{6624}who sticks up for the nigger.
{6625}{6685}And I'll stand by my words,
{6686}{6766}'cause I don't like these people,|never will do!
{6810}{6852}Words are my weapons.
{6853}{6932}Violence is something|I'm not very good at.
{6933}{7004}I don't think you can explain|how things happen,
{7005}{7061}other than sometimes|theyjust should,
{7062}{7148}and the Sex Pistols|should have happened, and did.
{7149}{7204}We went out in the garden.
{7205}{7249}Get off your arse!
{7621}{7678}I was born|in Queen Charlotte's Hospital
{7679}{7750}on September 3rd, 1955...
{7751}{7824}And I lived with my mother|and my stepfather
{7825}{7885}who I thought was my dad,|in the basement
{7886}{7921}in Shepherd's Bush.
{7922}{7987}And I slept at the edge|of their bed on a camp bed.
{7988}{8064}My real dad, he bailed|when I was two.
{8065}{8166}His name was Don Jarvis.|He was an amateur boxer.
{8167}{8274}I definitely didn't feel|wanted as a child.
{8309}{8393}Well, I was born and raised|around West London,
{8394}{8456}the Shepherd's Bush|and Hammersmith area.
{8457}{8519}It was typically|working class.
{8520}{8622}I met Steve 'cause we lived around|the corner from each other.
{8647}{8705}I went to school|near Paul and Steve,
{8706}{8748}next to Wormwood Scrubs|Prison.
{8749}{8798}Me dad was a factory worker,
{8799}{8869}and mum worked at|a powder puff factory.
{8869}{8940}If you were to look back at me|as a school kid,
{8941}{9004}you'd see a very shy, quiet,
{9005}{9112}Iittle church mouse kind of|character in North London.
{9148}{9198}Irish immigrant parents.
{9199}{9259}My mum taught me|to read and write
{9260}{9348}after meningitis, a serious|illness I had at seven,
{9349}{9412}when I was in a coma|for a year.
{9413}{9510}When I came out of hospital,|I was completely brain wiped...
{9511}{9603}Old memories had been erased...|Didn't remember anything at all.
{9604}{9650}Just backwards in everything.
{9651}{9704}It was like having to start|all over again.
{9733}{9768}# Pictures of Lily... #
{9769}{9871}How does it get from the man|to the egg?
{9872}{9961}I actually got put back a year|'cause I was so stupid.
{9962}{10030}And I would never pay|any attention in class,
{10031}{10076}I was just always|daydreaming.
{10077}{10136}Steve was quite wild at 1 0,|1 1 years old.
{10137}{10202}I think he was always getting|into trouble then.
{10203}{10288}You should make sure that you've|got the thing around the right way.
{10289}{10386}On the other hand --|I got four fingers and a thumb.
{10387}{10459}I question everything,|I always have done.
{10460}{10503}If we were doing Shakespeare,
{10504}{10556}a teacher would give me|a hard time,
{10557}{10606}and he wouldn't tell me|what I wanted to know.
{10607}{10659}I'd ask outright questions,
{10660}{10705}and you're not supposed|to do that.
{10705}{10752}You're just supposed|to accept,
{10753}{10809}"lt's Shakespeare.|It's great, you're not."
{10810}{10845}That's not good enough|for me.
{10898}{10969}I would steal. I mean,|that's all I knew how to do.
{10969}{11066}I used to watch my parents steal|at Tescos when I was six.
{11067}{11115}And I was always|getting in trouble.
{11116}{11171}And so that's all|there was -- music.
{11172}{11253}# Flavors of the|mountain streamline... #
{11254}{11344}I was totally into music --|Roxy Music and Bowie.
{11345}{11422}I thought that musicians fell|from the sky at that point.
{11423}{11476}I didn't think anyone|could be a musician.
{11477}{11594}# School's out forever! #
{11595}{11700}I was very quiet at school|up until about 14 or 1 5,
{11701}{11752}when I decided|I'd had enough.
{11753}{11829}I knew we were being|fobbed off...
{11830}{11930}and basically given a shoddy|third-rate version of reality.
{11931}{12003}So you would not be capable|of questioning your future,
{12004}{12049}because you didn't have one.
{12194}{12277}My mother loved Alice Cooper|as much as I did.
{12277}{12361}She had an extremely|varied taste for everything
{12362}{12442}from lrish folk music|to T. Rex...
{12443}{12496}To some early Bowie.
{12497}{12564}Lots of the heavy metal|that was around at the time,
{12565}{12653}everything.|Extremely Catholic taste.
{12654}{12749}# I want all you skinheads|to get up on your feet #
{12750}{12833}# Put your braces together|and your boots on your feet #
{12834}{12910}There was a lot of black kids|down Shepherd's Bush,
{12911}{12960}and we used to go|to their parties
{12961}{13008}and listen to ska music.
{13009}{13054}It sort of developed|from there really,
{13055}{13110}I think, our interest|in music.
{13111}{13179}I think it was Wally...|the famous Wally Nightingale,
{13180}{13232}who said,|"Well, let's start a band."
{13233}{13300}At the time, Wally said|Steve would be the singer,
{13301}{13360}and I would be on drums.
{13361}{13440}Wally actually played guitar,|and so it was up to each of us
{13441}{13496}to go off and learn|our instruments.
{13497}{13548}We used to rehearse|and rehearse,
{13549}{13620}and just kind of like,|fantasize, really.
{13637}{13672}If I wanted to wear something
{13673}{13719}that T. Rex was wearing|the week before,
{13720}{13767}I'd go down King's Road|and fucking steal it.
{13800}{13877}I always used to end up|at "Let It Rock" which was owned
{13878}{13948}by Malcolm McLaren|and Vivienne Westwood.
{13949}{14001}All the other shops we went in|down King's Road,
{14002}{14057}you'd walk in and you'd get|1 0 poofs on you,
{14058}{14103}asking you what you want,|"Can I help you?"
{14104}{14157}That's why we'd always|end up at Vivienne's,
{14158}{14200}because it was|like a hang-out.
{14201}{14247}I liked the clothes,|they were different.
{14248}{14315}It weren't all flares|and kipper ties.
{14316}{14380}It was Teddy Boy clothes.|It was a lot more rebellious,
{14381}{14448}and obviously|I was drawn to that.
{14449}{14496}The Teddy Boy thing, for me,
{14497}{14555}was all about the idea|of being a peacock,
{14556}{14628}and standing out in the crowd,|but at the same time
{14629}{14706}feeling a sense that you are|part of the dispossessed,
{14707}{14782}which -- at the end|of my art school term,
{14783}{14832}I thought I could make|a profit by.
{14858}{14905}I became friends with Malcolm
{14906}{14980}because he had a lot|of contacts in music.
{14981}{15020}He seemed to know everybody.
{15021}{15073}He finds a way in|with his blague,
{15074}{15121}which is perfect|for a manager.
{15141}{15195}I walked up and down|the King's Road
{15196}{15280}with complete anger|and resentment.
{15310}{15366}People were extremely absurd,
{15367}{15462}and still stuck into flares|and platform shoes
{15463}{15527}and neatly coiffured|longish hair,
{15528}{15596}and pretending the world|wasn't really happening.
{15597}{15662}It was an escapism|that I resented.
{15663}{15710}There was also|a garbage strike
{15711}{15769}going on for years|and years and years,
{15769}{15827}and there was trash piled|1 0 foot high.
{15828}{15886}They seem to have|missed that.
{15887}{15979}Wear the garbage bag,|for God's sake --
{15980}{16053}and then you're dealing|with it.
{16054}{16113}And that's what I|would be doing...
{16113}{16194}I would wrap myself|basically in trash.
{16195}{16267}...and that so lamely|and unfashionable...
{16268}{16349}that dogs bark at me|as I halt by them.
{16350}{16432}I've got news for you.|Dogs bark at me.
{16475}{16578}In a weird way, that whole|persona of, say, "Richard Ill"
{16579}{16651}helped when I joined|the Sex Pistols.
{16652}{16745}Deformed, hilarious,|grotesque --
{16745}{16809}and the "Hunchback|of Notre Dame" is in there,
{16810}{16870}and just bizarre characters
{16871}{16947}that somehow or other,|through all of their deformities
{16948}{16991}managed to achieve something.
{16992}{17036}# ...Just for a short while #
{17037}{17084}# She'll scratch in the sand #
{17085}{17130}# Won't let go of his hand... #
{17131}{17198}Steve was a kind|of a kleptomaniac, really.
{17199}{17260}I'm sure he would be|diagnosed as that, you know,
{17261}{17324}because he couldn't keep|his hands in his pockets...
{17325}{17381}which was quite handy,|really.
{17382}{17453}We'd always know a way in round|the back of Hammersmith Odeon,
{17454}{17501}being our local area.
{17528}{17576}# The Jean Genie... #
{17577}{17659}David Bowie was playing|the Ziggy farewell thing,
{17660}{17729}and while the roadies|was asleep in the front row,
{17730}{17811}he'd be going around on stage|snipping all the microphones off.
{17812}{17880}We had great guitars,|amplifiers,
{17881}{17968}great drum kits,|PA system, everything,
{17969}{18033}but, you know, we couldn't|play it properly.
{18126}{18192}To prevent myself|from being beaten up
{18193}{18263}by what were Uxbridge|Teddy Boys
{18264}{18320}coming in,|pilfering in the store,
{18321}{18372}I decided to go down|another route --
{18373}{18432}rubber and leather|fetish wear.
{18433}{18465}I felt that...
{18466}{18559}that would look fun and exciting|on the King's Road
{18560}{18643}because it would have|a similar effrontery
{18644}{18749}that Teddy Boy clothes had,|except it would be new.
{18750}{18804}Malcolm's shop interested me
{18805}{18875}because of the rubber wear.
{18930}{19020}Fascinating that people can get|themselves into such a predicament
{19021}{19104}that the only way they can|have sex is in a face mask
{19105}{19165}and a rubber T-shirt.
{19199}{19252}With a bollock weight.
{19279}{19363}How does it become that way?|It becomes like that for you
{19364}{19455}because you just cannot|face reality.
{19546}{19590}Steve just came back one day,|and said,
{19591}{19635}"l found a bass player."|I said, "Who's that?"
{19636}{19704}He said, "This guy, Glen,|who works in Malcolm's shop."
{19705}{19769}Lo and behold, I started|rehearsing with them.
{19770}{19882}They had so much equipment that|Steve had "assembled," shall we say?
{19883}{19946}We were always pestering|Malcolm to manage us,
{19947}{20036}and he said he'd be interested|if we got rid of Wally.
{20037}{20095}He came down once, he said,|"You shouldn't sing,
{20096}{20160}you should play guitar.|You should get a singer."
{20161}{20229}We realized wally was gonna|have to go.
{20265}{20328}Alas, poor [ Wally ]...
{20329}{20388}I knew him, Horatio.
{20389}{20446}Round this time|there was a group of guys
{20447}{20497}who came from the north side|of London,
{20498}{20539}who used to come|into the shop
{20540}{20594}probably for the same reasons|we did,
{20595}{20630}you know, on a Saturday,|whatever...
{20631}{20701}there was the group of them,|apparently all called "John."
{20702}{20772}Steve and Paul never believed|we were all called John...
{20773}{20828}They could never take that.
{20829}{20876}Sid's real name is John.
{20877}{20918}Theyjust thought we were
{20919}{21001}Iike a "Clockwork Orange" gang,|you know -- "The Johns."
{21025}{21104}I've no idea why|they picked me out...
{21105}{21201}other than they thought I looked|well different from the pack.
{21226}{21287}We arranged to meet John|one night...
{21288}{21333}in a pubjust down the road.
{21334}{21413}We had a few pints, and then|we came back to the shop.
{21438}{21498}We gave the singer|an audition
{21499}{21578}in my shop, later on,|after the pub had closed,
{21579}{21629}for him to imitate,
{21630}{21701}and for him|to try to sing along
{21702}{21774}with an Alice Cooper track|on the jukebox
{21775}{21839}called "Eighteen",|which I adored.
{21840}{21924}And he sung it like|"The Hunchback of Notre Dame."
{21981}{22035}# I'm eighteen #
{22036}{22098}# And I don't know|what I want #
{22099}{22157}I always did view myself
{22158}{22229}as one damn ugly fucker.
{22230}{22319}I certainly weren't|no belle of the ball.
{22320}{22377}John just started...
{22377}{22442}going into spasms|in front of the jukebox,
{22443}{22496}and singing,|and doing his act,
{22497}{22565}what later became what everyone|knows and loves, you know.
{22591}{22668}And I knew right away then|that he was the singer.
{22669}{22740}He was... gonna be the one,|really.
{22764}{22819}I personally wouldn't|have got him in the band,
{22820}{22865}even though he looked|like a star.
{22865}{22954}I thought he was a wanker for taking|the piss, and he wasn't serious...
{22955}{23012}But then, after speaking to him|for a while,
{23013}{23071}I realize that|that was his own insecurity
{23072}{23146}to take the piss because|he wasn't really a singer.
{23193}{23253}John was from a different world|from me and Cookie.
{23253}{23318}He's more of an intellectual,|John.
{23347}{23411}I knew what Steve was.
{23412}{23512}I knew he had potential|to be a great person.
{23513}{23591}There's something in him|that's genuine.
{23592}{23704}I can see that there's a tragedy|in him, just like in me.
{23705}{23786}Deep down inside,|they're wounded people.
{23787}{23840}And then there's Glen...
{23841}{23936}waffling on about nice things|like the Beatles.
{23937}{24030}We're the very first people|to call each other cunts
{24031}{24074}outright --
{24075}{24138}face on --|and know it.
{24139}{24224}And we are. We all are...|All in our way.
{24225}{24276}You put all this|together, and it...
{24277}{24378}it makes for high drama,|a bit like a Harold Pinter play.
{24379}{24440}It shouldn't work,|but it does.
{25033}{25104}All our first rehearsals|were a nightmare.
{25105}{25165}I couldn't hold|a damn note,
{25166}{25253}Paul couldn't really keep time,|I couldn't play guitar.
{25254}{25346}I fucking hated it.|It was just a fucking noise,
{25347}{25429}but I just stuck in there,|because that's all I had.
{25430}{25483}# ...no lip, child #
{25484}{25553}# And I mean what I say #
{25588}{25648}# Don't give me|no lip, child #
{25649}{25719}# You'll be sorry one day #
{25720}{25799}Oh, fuck, it's awful.|I hate songs like that.
{25824}{25893}Right from the start,|we'd argue --
{25893}{25972}bitterly, bitterly,|from day one rehearsal,
{25973}{26023}pure, full-on row.
{26024}{26077}It would be constantly,
{26078}{26128}"You know, you've gotta|learn to sing."
{26129}{26180}And it's like, "Why?"
{26181}{26245}"Says who?|Who wrote the rules here?"
{26246}{26350}But that's all right, you need|that difference of character.
{26351}{26415}I didn't think,|if I could be a sculptor,
{26416}{26476}I necessarily needed clay...
{26477}{26572}I suddenly thought,|"You can use people!"
{26573}{26689}And it's people that I used,|like an artist.
{26690}{26756}I manipulated.
{26757}{26865}So, creating something|called the "Sex Pistols"
{26866}{26963}was my painting,|my sculpture,
{26964}{27010}my little "Artful Dodgers."
{27011}{27096}Humph --|you don't create me...
{27097}{27146}I am me.
{27147}{27194}There is a difference.
{27195}{27289}Everyone on the planet|knows Malcolm's full of shit.
{27290}{27356}He's convinced people now|that he's full of shit,
{27357}{27434}by all the shit that he says,|it gets worse and worse.
{27435}{27499}And the idea of the name|"Sex Pistols"
{27500}{27605}was sexy young assassins.|"Pistol" meaning a gun --
{27629}{27705}and then "pistol" meaning|a kind of penis.
{27706}{27798}There was never a relationship|with the manager -- for me,
{27799}{27874}other than he would always try|to steal my ideas,
{27875}{27924}and claim them|to be his own.
{27925}{27994}I had to accept|that he was the manager
{27995}{28085}because he was their manager|before I joined the band.
{28086}{28141}I think they're the same|fucking star sign.
{28142}{28195}They're the same kind|of personality.
{28196}{28241}They were always|butting heads.
{28242}{28309}It was definitely John|who steered the ship
{28310}{28350}into the way we looked.
{28351}{28436}Torn, safety pin,|zips all over the gaff,
{28437}{28488}third rate tramp thing.
{28489}{28564}That was poverty, really.|Lack of money.
{28565}{28620}The arse of your|pants falls out,
{28621}{28683}you just use safety pins.
{28684}{28735}And I always used|to call him "rotten,"
{28736}{28793}'cause his fucking teeth|were like, dreadful,
{28793}{28841}they looked like dog-ends,
{28841}{28900}and -- itjust stuck.
{28901}{28995}Steve always looked like|a hairdresser on the high road.
{28997}{29039}He had a perm,
{29040}{29097}and unfortunately,|it became permanent.
{29193}{29257}I don't have any heroes.
{29258}{29307}They're all useless.
{29308}{29361}I mean, there's no bands around,|is there?
{29362}{29402}None.
{29403}{29449}None that are accessible.
{29449}{29508}It's Emerson, Lake and Palmer.
{29620}{29672}All those super bands|at that time --
{29673}{29774}Emerson, Lake and Palmer,|Yes -- they were dinosaurs,
{29775}{29856}They were dreadful, because|they were fucking boring.
{29857}{29952}Uriah Heep...|Fucking, you know... Gong!
{29953}{30046}I wanted the Sex Pistols|to compete
{30047}{30102}with the Bay City Rollers!
{30103}{30204}Can you imagine Johnny Rotten|singing "Shang-a-Lang"?
{30234}{30288}# Shang-a-lang #
{30326}{30372}# Shang-a-lang #
{30396}{30448}# Shang-a-lang,|shang-a-lang #
{30449}{30492}Ugh-hh!
{30493}{30571}Stradivarius --|was a terrible painter...
{30683}{30747}and Rembrandt --|made rotten violins.
{30772}{30827}I got interested in the arts,
{30828}{30889}and ended up going|to St. Martin's for a year.
{30890}{30949}I walked in there and asked|to see the social secretary,
{30950}{30997}and this guy said,|"Well, I am."
{30998}{31052}And it was Sebastian Conran.
{31053}{31099}And he said, "Well, what's|the name of your band?"
{31100}{31157}And I said, "The Sex Pistols,"|and Sebastian went --
{31158}{31244}"The Sex Pistols?|Oh, we must have them."
{31273}{31356}I remembered being|just fucking terrified,
{31357}{31428}and I had to take a Mandrax|to calm down.
{31445}{31484}Hello.
{31509}{31567}Hello,|I'm pissed again.
{31568}{31640}I think I took two Mandrax.|We went up there,
{31641}{31713}and it was all these arty-farty|fuckers in this one room.
{31713}{31759}There was no stage,
{31760}{31815}and there was another band|called "Bazooka Joe"
{31816}{31861}that Adam Ant|was the bass player in,
{31861}{31914}and we were all|knocking the pints back --
{31915}{31986}and it was time to go on,|and the Mandrax were kicking in,
{31987}{32035}and we started playing...
{32056}{32128}# ...you to know|that I ain't your baby #
{32129}{32199}# I want you to know|I don't care #
{32330}{32385}I remembered looking|at John, and thinking,
{32386}{32444}"This is fucking fantastic.|I love this."
{32445}{32494}It was like one of them|magical moments.
{32495}{32573}Everything in the universe|fucking clicked.
{32574}{32633}# What'cha gonna do|about it... #
{32659}{32748}Glen definitely wanted to be|on "Top of the Pops."
{32777}{32850}# I want you to know|I don't care... #
{32851}{32924}# I want you to know|that I love you baby... #
{32925}{32974}To me, that's really naff.
{32975}{33055}It's saying, "l want you to know|I don't care"
{33056}{33118}Comes quite naturally.
{33119}{33199}If I take other people's songs,|I put a twist on them.
{33357}{33423}Finally -- we're actually|playing in a band,
{33424}{33493}I ain't the singer,|I'm comfortable playing the guitar --
{33493}{33541}mind you,|I was fucked up --
{33680}{33742}and next thing I know,|they've pulled the plug on us,
{33743}{33798}and it was all over.|We're just like out of it,
{33799}{33870}and wandering around|down Piccadilly Circus.
{33896}{33962}I die of nerves|before I go on stage,
{33963}{34033}cause I don't know|what I'm gonna do.
{34033}{34118}And because of that,|I'd have to just pull things out
{34119}{34195}from deep down inside.
{34196}{34304}Hello -- # 76 trombones|to the hit parade #
{34353}{34425}Look, there's Arthur Askey|in there.
{34426}{34500}There's Ken Dodd --|# We are the Daddymen... #
{34501}{34559}# We come from Notty Ash #
{34560}{34591}There's even...
{34592}{34652}"There's nothing wrong|with me."
{34653}{34702}- Do we know any...|- Oi...
{34703}{34775}Do we know any other|fucking songs that we could do?
{34776}{34858}What England didn't understand|about the Sex Pistols
{34859}{34922}is that we are music hall.
{34923}{34974}Shall we do "Roadrunner"?
{34999}{35072}I hate that.|It's fucking awful. Stop it.
{35073}{35136}Stop it,|it's fucking awful!
{35199}{35291}There was always a sense|of piss take, and fun to it.
{35292}{35365}Shout out what -- how it starts.|What's the first line?
{35366}{35452}There's a sense of comedy|in the English,
{35453}{35523}even in your grimmest moment.
{35524}{35579}Right-- can you start|at the beginning?
{35619}{35653}I can't hear you, Paul.
{35654}{35692}You laugh.
{35758}{35804}Who wants a bunk-up?
{35836}{35862}Who wants a bunk-up?
{35917}{35957}Who wants a bunk-up?
{35958}{35997}# With the radio on... #
{35998}{36031}"...Deform'd, unfinish'd..."
{36032}{36098}# Roadrunner, roadrunner...
{36141}{36201}"Deform'd, unfinish'd..."
{36260}{36316}Deform'd, unfinish'd...
{36354}{36420}One week we'd be|playing up in high Wycombe
{36421}{36472}opening up|for Screaming Lord Sutch,
{36473}{36560}and I remember seeing|some faces, guys with long hair.
{36561}{36640}"When all other indications|suggest..."
{36641}{36695}When all other indications|suggest...
{36696}{36769}Then, a week later,|we'd be playing at "The Nashville,"
{36808}{36872}...that we're in|for a dirty night.
{36905}{36937}"...a dirty night."
{36938}{37009}And I'd see the same people|with their hair cut short,
{37010}{37066}and wearing a ripped-up|t-shirt.
{37091}{37156}# Goin' a thousand miles|an hour #
{37173}{37255}Every gig you'd see a few more,|and a few more, and a few more,
{37256}{37311}people who just got converted.
{37442}{37561}The Sex Pistols definitely|created new environments.
{37620}{37751}It was incredible good to see|the audience being individual.
{37752}{37819}# ...radio on... #
{37820}{37876}# Roadrunner, roadrunner... #
{37877}{37916}"Ain't nothing wrong with me."
{37917}{37979}Oh, God, I don't know it.|Fucking ridiculous.
{37980}{38088}There was some absolutely stunning|original people out there.
{38118}{38160}"There's nothing wrong with me."
{38185}{38228}Sioux cat woman...
{38229}{38312}That woman required a lot|of skill, style and bravery...
{38356}{38407}to look like a cat.
{38639}{38687}There was a couple|of years there
{38688}{38732}where it was stunning.
{38733}{38846}People that had no self-respect|suddenly started to view themselves
{38847}{38924}as beautiful in|not being beautiful.
{38925}{39000}Women started|to appreciate themselves
{39001}{39059}as not second class citizens.
{39060}{39123}Punk made that clear.
{39187}{39242}I've always talked|to the audience
{39243}{39302}in a one-to-one way|after gigs.
{39303}{39368}"Where do you live?|What's life like for you?"
{39369}{39428}Absolute basics.
{39450}{39508}# She put her bicycle #
{39509}{39564}# under a tree #
{39565}{39647}# I think that girl took|a fancy to me... #
{39648}{39696}But it was fun, I guess,|talking to them.
{39697}{39766}Actually, I didn't give a|fuck about talking about the band,
{39767}{39829}I just wanted to get|me dick sucked, really.
{39830}{39896}That was always the first thing|on my mind.
{39897}{39972}I wasn't interested in talking|about politics after the show,
{39973}{40053}I didn't even know who the fucking|Prime Minister was at the time.
{40054}{40121}# Let's have a ride|on your bike #
{40122}{40187}I pretty much just wanted|to have a bunk-up,
{40188}{40252}Iike any good teenager does.
{40273}{40370}# I was born with a plastic|spoon in my mouth... #
{40577}{40656}# You didn't look me|in the eye #
{40657}{40745}# Crocodile tears|are what you cry #
{40844}{40889}"Substitute" I liked...
{40890}{40969}but I only liked|certain phrases in it.
{40970}{41017}So I'd twist them about.
{41017}{41095}# You're so fat,|I see right through... #
{41133}{41236}"Oh, no you can't do that,|it's a classic,"
{41237}{41278}says Glen.
{41359}{41400}Fuck off!
{41562}{41627}I think when we started|writing our own stuff...
{41628}{41690}is when it got|more interesting.
{41713}{41807}Because that's when it became|our own musical force.
{41862}{41944}Glen was coming up with most|of the ideas for songs,
{41945}{41996}and John would just be|sitting in the corner,
{41997}{42042}scribbling his lyrics out,|there and then,
{42043}{42078}while we were playing along|to it.
{42079}{42128}We had something,|we had a spirit.
{42129}{42185}But what we didn't have,|we didn't have a way
{42186}{42236}of putting that into words...
{42237}{42276}which is what John had.
{42277}{42381}The first line I wrote,|was "l am an antichrist,"
{42382}{42480}and I couldn't think of a damn|thing that rhymed with it,
{42481}{42572}and "anarchist" just fitted|really nicely.
{42591}{42643}The only thing I didn't like|about "Anarchy"
{42644}{42692}was the dreadful rhyme --
{42693}{42767}"antichrist -- anarchist,"|it used to always make me wince.
{42829}{42901}Oh, some decent fucking music|at last!
{43035}{43082}# Right... #
{43083}{43128}# Now #
{43258}{43341}# I am an antichrist #
{43342}{43428}# I am an anarchist #
{43429}{43518}# Don't know what I want,|but I know how to get it #
{43519}{43602}# I wanna destroy passerby #
{43603}{43680}# 'Cause l... #
{43681}{43746}# Wanna be... #
{43776}{43814}# Anarchy #
{43815}{43864}This band wasn't about|making people happy,
{43865}{43910}it was attack --
{43911}{43961}attack, attack, attack.
{43976}{44053}# Anarchy for the UK #
{44054}{44147}# It's coming sometime|maybe #
{44148}{44236}# I give a wrong time,|stop a traffic line #
{44237}{44323}# Your future dream|is a shopping scheme #
{44324}{44394}# 'Cause l... #
{44395}{44454}# I wanna be... #
{44489}{44556}# Anarchy #
{44748}{44836}Sid, he was the total|Pistols fan, really.
{44837}{44896}I fucking loved that band.
{44897}{44955}Along with a couple|of other kids that knew John,
{44956}{45046}I think I was about the biggest|fan they ever had.
{45169}{45263}# How many ways to get|what you want #
{45264}{45342}# I use the best|I use the rest... #
{45343}{45408}Rotten was like, incredible.
{45409}{45469}Just like unbelievable.
{45469}{45543}And Steve was fucking great|as well.
{45544}{45603}Glen was a cunt, as always.
{45604}{45688}# Wanna be... #
{45689}{45746}# Anarchy #
{45747}{45823}What made the Sex Pistols|different was John Rotten,
{45824}{45893}'cause he was a total|anti-star.
{45893}{45957}He didn't like wiggle his bum|or shake his hips,
{45958}{46036}he did robot dances,|and just fucked around,
{46037}{46087}and took the piss|out of everybody
{46088}{46158}in a real nasty, snidy way.
{46253}{46338}# ls this the MPLA #
{46339}{46435}# Or is this the UDA #
{46436}{46521}# Or is this the IRA #
{46522}{46614}# I thought it was the UK... #
{46689}{46773}The Bromley Contingent|all the front row lot,
{46774}{46828}they all ended up in bands,
{46829}{46913}hence you got|the punk movement.
{47038}{47117}# I am an antichrist #
{47118}{47192}# I am an anarchist #
{47193}{47269}To see us playing like,|just three chords
{47270}{47335}gave the message that anybody|could do this.
{47336}{47391}Which was great --|all these other bands started --
{47392}{47450}I enjoyed watching the Clash,|I enjoyed the Damned.
{47451}{47521}Itjust happened so quick,|and it was so exciting,
{47521}{47614}you'd think, "Wow, there's|really a movement starting here."
{47737}{47785}One chick came down|one night
{47785}{47867}wearing a polka dot|see-through mac --
{47868}{47920}and nothing else.
{47921}{48024}I actually saw one tourist|stagger as she came into the club.
{48025}{48086}He was so amazed|by her appearance.
{48187}{48239}Sid was amazing,|because he was
{48240}{48296}a stand out character|in the crowd,
{48297}{48334}because he wasn't|in the band then.
{48335}{48379}He invented the pogo|all by himself.
{48380}{48439}He'd just sort ofjump on|the shoulders of some people
{48440}{48480}to get a better look.
{48481}{48545}In the end he just started|jumping up and down anyway.
{48546}{48620}Yeah, I started it 'cause|I hated the Bromley Contingent,
{48621}{48670}and I invented a dance|that would involve
{48671}{48760}being able to knock them|all over the fucking "1 00 Club,"
{48761}{48824}so I just used to|throw myself about.
{48825}{48889}Leap up like horizontal,|and sideways,
{48890}{48932}just like boing...
{48933}{48977}Boing, boing, boing.
{48978}{49057}You'd like land on them,|and smash them into the floor.
{49081}{49119}Yeah...
{49120}{49171}My name is Nick Kent.
{49172}{49220}I'm a...
{49221}{49305}A once-renowned journalist|for "The New Musical Express."
{49306}{49362}Well, Sid,|as he was known then,
{49363}{49463}who I'd encountered once before,|I'd not actually met him --
{49464}{49533}was obviously under|the influence
{49533}{49592}of some sort of amphetamines
{49593}{49697}or extreme adrenaline|propulsing stimulants.
{49698}{49758}Sid Vicious was looking|for a fight.
{49759}{49818}Just fucking watch out, pal,|all right?
{49819}{49903}Or otherwise I'll fucking|slice you open.
{49904}{49968}He hit me over the head|a few times with a chain,
{49969}{50026}which didn't require|any stitches, fortunately.
{50027}{50092}I sort of wandered upstairs|in a complete...
{50093}{50177}Iather of blood|and confusion.
{50178}{50284}I truly admire|their attitude,
{50285}{50360}I thought it was...|very brave.
{50361}{50451}Immediately before this attack|occurred,
{50452}{50539}John Rotten was deep|in discussion with Sid.
{50540}{50659}I figure that John was --|"Johnny" -- as he's known,
{50660}{50728}was setting me up,|'cause this is all true.
{50729}{50800}In fact, Sid got the name|"Vicious" from that fight.
{50801}{50882}John Rotten christened him|"Vicious" from that fight.
{50883}{50949}Said he, falling|against the door.
{50950}{51034}Sid Vicious got the name|after my pet hamster,
{51035}{51094}that bit him one day...
{51095}{51156}when he was trying|to be sweet to it.
{51157}{51254}And its name was Sid,|and he really liked that.
{51279}{51344}"Your Sid was vicious."
{51345}{51425}The group were doing a very|private, I think, secret show,
{51426}{51479}at "The Screen on the Green,"|lslington.
{51509}{51580}I went along with a couple|of our A&R people,
{51581}{51629}and Chris Wright,|the chairman.
{51653}{51723}Knocked on the door, somebody opened|the door, and said, "Fuck off!"
{51785}{51827}Well we weren't gonna be|dissuaded,
{51828}{51909}so we sort of tapped on the door|again and said, "We're invited."
{51910}{51967}And a head popped 'round again,|and said, "Fuck Off!"
{52027}{52074}They were a particularly|ugly band.
{52075}{52158}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty #
{52198}{52244}# We're vacant #
{52245}{52331}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty #
{52371}{52409}# Vacant #
{52410}{52488}# Don't ask us to attend|'cause we're not all there #
{52489}{52557}# Don't pretend,|'cause I don't care #
{52558}{52629}And there was only a little bit|of a scuffle, nothing much.
{52787}{52839}I've known musicians|to defend themselves
{52840}{52893}if the thing goes|onto the stage,
{52894}{52944}But I've never seen musicians|drop their instruments
{52945}{53007}And sort of dive in|at a small scrap
{53008}{53068}And extend it,|and forget about the music.
{53069}{53119}And I found that a bit much.
{53204}{53271}I went back two or three times|after that,
{53272}{53324}just to make sure that...|you know, they were as bad
{53325}{53368}as I thought they were|the first time.
{53422}{53489}# ...and we don't care! #
{53529}{53575}Ever!
{53576}{53668}Why all the infamous|language?
{53669}{53721}"lnfamous language"?|You're joking.
{53722}{53796}I speak nothing but the fucking|English language.
{53797}{53890}And if that's "lnfamous,"|Then, huh-huh-huh, tough titters.
{53903}{53973}Basically, the Pistols'|attitude to the press
{53973}{54030}was one of completely|like "Fuck you," you know?
{54031}{54099}I mean, just absolutely|"Fuck you."
{54100}{54188}Which was great -- I mean,|it was the perfect antidote
{54189}{54301}to all the 99% of other|stupid rock groups
{54302}{54367}who like, licked the arse|of the press,
{54368}{54434}and, I mean, it worked|perfectly for them.
{54435}{54487}Mostjournalists|are masochists.
{54488}{54543}They're just toss pots,|most of them.
{54544}{54635}Don't accept the old order.|Get rid of it.
{54745}{54807}We've been there|for five years or more,
{54808}{54884}just waiting for this to happen,|and now it's happened.
{54885}{54944}It had to, it was the only thing|that could happen.
{54945}{54997}It was the only thing that|didn't come from the industry --
{54998}{55082}it came from the kids themselves.|Something had to come from the kids.
{55217}{55271}# Come on and join us #
{55272}{55330}# We're the young nation #
{55331}{55390}# Come on and join us #
{55391}{55444}# Nationwide... #
{55565}{55604}# Right... #
{55605}{55650}# Now #
{55790}{55871}# I am an antichrist #
{55872}{55958}# I am an anarchist... #
{55959}{56021}This group are leaders|of a whole new teenage cult
{56022}{56076}that seems to be on the way|to being as big
{56077}{56124}as mods and rockers were|in the '60s.
{56125}{56210}The cult is called "punk,"|the music, "punk rock."
{56211}{56307}Basic rock music --|raw, outrageous and crude,
{56308}{56372}Iike their fan magazine,|"Sniffing Glue."
{56373}{56420}I think our music|is very honest.
{56421}{56531}It's the most honest thing that's|been happening in the last 1 5 years.
{56532}{56563}Nothing to beat it.
{56564}{56633}Finding places to play|is becoming harder,
{56634}{56717}thanks to the reputation punks|are getting as troublemakers,
{56718}{56796}and the Sex Pistols themselves|even had to hire a strip club
{56797}{56882}to get their music heard.|Nowhere else would take them.
{57013}{57049}# Anarchy #
{57050}{57079}From the street.
{57190}{57254}I find the Pistols|very believable,
{57255}{57334}I find it's all related|to violence...
{57335}{57390}in the mind,|not in the body.
{57476}{57530}Malcolm began to get|a little bit serious about it,
{57531}{57602}and he brought in a lawyer|by the name of Fisher...
{57603}{57711}That dreadful lawyer whose name|I refuse to speak --
{57712}{57751}There was...
{57752}{57822}basically an auction|between Polydor and EMl.
{57823}{57888}We came up with a contract|which gave the Pistols
{57889}{57968}total creative control.
{58001}{58054}Malcolm decided|to go with EMl.
{58167}{58215}I went into the A&R department,|I said,
{58216}{58257}"Who are these crazy guys?"
{58258}{58309}They said, "lt's the Sex Pistols,|we just signed them.
{58310}{58338}They're tremendous."
{58339}{58395}And my first actual plug|for them was, after all this,
{58396}{58464}was by phoning up|the "Today" program.
{58465}{58508}They phoned back,|said, "Yes...
{58509}{58580}We'd like to use|the Sex Pistols," you know,
{58581}{58650}"Will that be okay?" I said,|"l'm sure it'll be all right."
{58651}{58733}They slung us in the green room,|with a fridge,
{58734}{58775}and I remember downing
{58776}{58832}about fucking four bottles|of "Blue Nun,"
{58833}{58907}and I was fucking just --|having a good old time,
{58908}{58986}pissed at this point,|by the time we went out there.
{58987}{59029}And that's all I remember.
{59030}{59130}They are "punk rockers."|the new craze, they tell me.
{59131}{59167}They are heroes --
{59168}{59244}not the nice, clean,|Rolling Stones.
{59245}{59316}They are as drunk as I am.|They are clean by comparison,
{59317}{59393}they are a group|called "the Sex Pistols,"
{59394}{59475}I am told that that group...
{59476}{59555}have received £40,000|from a record company.
{59556}{59613}Doesn't that seem to be|slightly opposed
{59614}{59685}to their anti-materialistic|view of life?
{59686}{59736}- No, the more, the merrier.|- Really?
{59737}{59777}- Oh, yeah.|- Tell me more about it.
{59778}{59809}We've fucking spent it.
{59810}{59875}- I don't know. Have you?|- Yeah, it's all gone.
{59876}{59950}No one even heard that one,|'cause he was drunk himself,
{59951}{59996}and he wasn't paying attention|when he asked,
{59997}{60075}"What did you do with the money?"|and I said, "We fucking spent it."
{60076}{60136}- Tell me more about it.|- We've fucking spent it.
{60137}{60204}- I don't know. Have you?|- Yeah, it's all gone.
{60205}{60256}- Really?|- Down the boozer.
{60257}{60296}Really?|Good Lord!
{60297}{60343}Now, I want to know|one thing:
{60344}{60419}Beethoven, Mozart, Bach|and Brahms have all died...
{60420}{60496}- They're all heroes of ours.|- Really? What were you saying?
{60497}{60540}- They're wonderful people.|- Are they?
{60541}{60614}- Yes, they really turn us on.|- But they're dead.
{60615}{60671}Suppose they turn|other people on?
{60672}{60716}That's just|their tough shit.
{60717}{60800}Rotten, he slipped up and said|"shit" under his breath.
{60801}{60864}- It's what?|- Nothing, a rude word.
{60865}{60916}- Next question.|- No, no...
{60917}{60964}What was the rude word?
{60965}{61028}- Shit.|- Was it really? Good heavens.
{61029}{61098}- You frighten me to death.|- All right, so you play games...
{61099}{61174}He's like your dad,|ain't he, this geezer?
{61175}{61203}Or your granddad.
{61204}{61253}Are you worried, or are you just|enjoying yourself?
{61254}{61295}- Enjoying myself.|- Are you?
{61296}{61331}That's what I thought.
{61332}{61387}- I always wanted to meet you.|- Did you really?
{61388}{61458}Siouxsie, she was just being|coy with him,
{61459}{61505}And he said,|"Oh, maybe we'll meet after?"
{61506}{61556}We'll meet afterwards,|shall we?
{61557}{61642}You dirty sod.|You dirty old man.
{61643}{61697}Steve completely understood
{61698}{61759}that he was talking|to a drunk
{61760}{61817}as you would a drunk|in a pub,
{61818}{61872}and he just topped him.
{61938}{61985}Go on, you've got|another five seconds,
{61986}{62043}- say something outrageous.|- You dirty bastard.
{62044}{62091}I just remember|this fucking cunt
{62093}{62160}just started provoking us,|and we coated him off.
{62161}{62211}- Go on -- again.|- You dirty fucker.
{62212}{62280}- What a clever boy.|- What a fucking rotter.
{62281}{62362}That's it for tonight.|The other rocker, Eamonn,
{62363}{62423}and I'm saying nothing else about|him, will be back tomorrow.
{62425}{62478}I'll be seeing you soon.|I hope I'm not seeing you again.
{62479}{62513}From me, though,|goodnight.
{62513}{62569}McLaren was there.|He was terrified.
{62570}{62613}He was shitting himself.
{62614}{62664}He was death-white,|you know, going
{62665}{62722}"We'd fucking better|get out of here, quick!"
{62723}{62789}But the very next day,|it was all his big idea.
{62858}{62952}It was perfect stand-up comedy.|It was Arthur Askey.
{62977}{63054}# Well, I don't mind|the things that you say #
{63055}{63137}# I don't even mind|goin' out of my way #
{63137}{63221}# I try and do|these things for you #
{63222}{63312}# Why should I do it?|I'm always untrue #
{63401}{63473}That's all, a four letter word|done everything.
{63527}{63592}# Goin' outta my head #
{63630}{63670}I loved it...
{63671}{63769}I fucking loved it.|It was like finally, I've arrived.
{63770}{63840}Let the circus begin.
{63894}{63977}# The bog is no place|to see your face... #
{63978}{64024}The committee have decided,
{64025}{64080}that in fairness|to the public of Derby,
{64081}{64169}the Sex Pistols will not|perform here tonight,
{64170}{64248}but we are quite agreeable|that the three other groups
{64249}{64326}that have already been booked|will go on.
{64355}{64415}For the last 1 2 months,|punk rock has become
{64417}{64476}almost a battle cry|in British society.
{64477}{64542}For many people, it's a bigger|threat to our way of life
{64543}{64606}than Russian Communism|or hyper-inflation,
{64607}{64701}and it generates more popular|excitement than either of those.
{64701}{64761}We hope tonight,|by this protest
{64762}{64851}to make Wales know, and to let|the people of this town know,
{64852}{64941}that we do protest|and it is by no fault of ours,
{64942}{64997}that this thing|has come to Caerphilly.
{64998}{65070}When your local council|didn't ban the punk rock concert,
{65071}{65133}you actually went down there|and tried to stop it yourself?
{65134}{65185}No, we never went|to stop it at any time.
{65186}{65237}We went there with a very|positive Gospel message.
{65238}{65304}We have done everything|humanly possible
{65305}{65352}to ban this thing|and to stop it.
{65353}{65401}Sir, can I ask you why|you're here tonight?
{65402}{65497}Because I am...|recognized as a Christian.
{65498}{65585}If I thought one of mine was|in there, I'd go drag them out.
{65586}{65666}They're outside, freezing.|We're in here, we're all right.
{65745}{65800}This one's about|Harold Wilson --
{65801}{65864}It's called "Liar."
{65865}{65907}# You lie, lie, lie,|lie lie... #
{65908}{66038}# Sleep in heavenly peace #
{66039}{66098}# Should have realized... #
{66133}{66197}On the "Anarchy" tour|we was actually followed
{66198}{66264}everywhere across the country,|from gig to gig,
{66265}{66352}and we had to turn up|to show willingness to play,
{66353}{66402}so presumably we would get|the money,
{66403}{66467}although it looked pound to a penny|that they wasn't gonna let us play.
{66528}{66604}Mr. Stabler, you can't watch|punk concerts in Newcastle either?
{66605}{66688}The decision was made when|we discovered it was mere children
{66689}{66746}that would be watching|the performance.
{66747}{66827}The average adult will go see|a strip show, or a blue film.
{66828}{66918}Banned in this town, and being|banned in that town.
{66919}{66990}And it really wasn't|about us playing any more,
{66991}{67063}it was about this controversy|that we were like,
{67064}{67129}throwing up on stage,|and spitting.
{67161}{67220}And I remember going|across the Pennines,
{67221}{67282}being followed by a fleet|of press people,
{67283}{67355}and we went to stop|to get coffee and a sandwich,
{67357}{67412}and we could hear what these|press people were saying.
{67413}{67450}One press guy|said to the other,
{67451}{67486}"Did you get anything?"|and the other one said,
{67487}{67548}"l got two 'fucks' and a 'shit'|from Johnny Rotten."
{67549}{67622}Can I now turn to Bernard|Brook-Partridge in London...
{67623}{67714}Most of these groups would be|vastly improved by sudden death.
{67715}{67779}The worst, currently,|are the Sex Pistols.
{67780}{67838}They are the antithesis|of humankind...
{67863}{67911}And the whole world|would be vastly improved
{67912}{67958}by their total and utter|non-existence.
{67959}{68016}# You're a liar #
{68058}{68117}# Lie, lie, lie, lie... #
{68139}{68212}The day Johnny Rotten goes back on|the words he writes in his songs,
{68213}{68265}is the day he dies.|I know that for a fact.
{68266}{68324}I think people did feel|that this was...
{68325}{68374}this was a sort of|a downhill thing,
{68375}{68452}and was a monster in our|presence, and actually would,
{68453}{68531}cause problems of image|for the record industry.
{68556}{68615}At that point, someone at EMI|took the decision
{68616}{68684}that they no longer wished|to have the act on the label.
{68757}{68804}This is about EMl.
{68851}{68929}They're major labels|with major attitudes,
{68930}{69028}and they want everything to be|fake and easily manipulative.
{69029}{69105}And you can't be having that|with people like us.
{69106}{69191}- Let's call it chaos!|- Itjust doesn't happen.
{69192}{69272}# An unlimited supply #
{69273}{69336}# And there is no reason why #
{69337}{69393}They told us|that they were unable
{69394}{69447}to continue|to promote the act --
{69448}{69492}and would we kindly leave.
{69529}{69570}# E-M-l #
{69571}{69615}"Let's call it chaos!"
{69616}{69656}# E-M-l #
{69657}{69696}"Let's call it chaos!"
{69697}{69740}# E-M-l #
{69741}{69781}"Let's call it chaos!"
{69871}{69905}Ouch.
{69906}{69989}# ...With an unlimited|supply #
{69989}{70078}# That was the only reason #
{70079}{70169}# We all had to say goodbye #
{70170}{70260}# Unlimited supply --|E-M-l #
{70261}{70343}# There is no reason why --|E-M-l #
{70344}{70394}# Unlimited supply #
{70395}{70428}# E-M-l #
{70429}{70475}# Hello, EMI #
{70476}{70538}# Good -- bye! #
{70573}{70667}It started with John and Glen|falling out, really.
{70669}{70716}Over what,|I don't really know,
{70717}{70768}just a clash of personalities,|et cetera.
{70769}{70824}When you talk|like an arsehole...
{70825}{70897}and look like an arsehole,|you're an arsehole.
{70898}{70976}There was obviously a big|problem between me and John.
{70977}{71039}I felt that once John|got his face in the papers,
{71040}{71093}he'd become|a different person --
{71094}{71135}which I didn't|particularly like.
{71136}{71223}When we went to Holland, my last|gig with them was at the Paradiso.
{71224}{71282}I felt everybody|was on my case.
{71283}{71359}He was always complaining|that we were too outrageous,
{71360}{71436}and it's a funny thing,|but he was always washing himself.
{71437}{71485}Whenever we'd get|into a hotel,
{71486}{71560}he'd be washing his|fucking feet in the sink.
{71561}{71609}Me and Steve were like that,|I suppose,
{71610}{71657}and John always felt|on the outside.
{71658}{71720}He thought by bringing Sid in,|he would have someone there,
{71721}{71765}Iike a partner, you know?
{71766}{71808}Someone a bit closer to him.
{71852}{71891}I'd heard that they'd been|rehearsing with Sid.
{71892}{71944}Nobody had the courtesy|to tell me.
{72077}{72149}# I've seen you in the mirror|when the story began #
{72150}{72221}# And I fell in love with you|I love your mortal sin... #
{72222}{72276}It had become like|a cartoon strip band,
{72277}{72349}as opposed to a rock and roll|band that actually plays
{72350}{72389}and does something for real.
{72390}{72443}# I got no emotions|for anybody else #
{72444}{72510}# You better understand|I'm in love with myself #
{72525}{72601}Glen had reached a point|where he decided
{72602}{72688}that the band's direction|was absolutely alien
{72689}{72752}to anything he wanted|to be associated with.
{72753}{72794}That's absolute bollocks.
{72795}{72868}I think one of Malcolm's games|was, sort of divide and conquer.
{72869}{72921}Malcolm had told John|I'd said a lot of stuff
{72922}{72972}which I hadn't said,|and Malcolm had told me
{72973}{73036}John had said a lot|of stuff that he hadn't said.
{73062}{73128}I respect him.|I always did.
{73129}{73177}He taught them to play.
{73177}{73240}I kind of regretted|him leaving...
{73241}{73312}because Sid couldn't play|a fucking note.
{73313}{73388}# ...see his picture hanging|on your wall #
{73513}{73591}I feel guilty about Sid,
{73592}{73704}because I wish I could have|told him more...
{73705}{73759}about what to expect.
{73804}{73875}Well... I was getting|my own group together,
{73877}{73923}"The Flowers of Romance,"
{73924}{73986}and Rotten asked me|if I wanted to join the --
{73987}{74034}there was this big hoo-ha,|and Malcolm said,
{74035}{74092}"lt's all a big secret, man,"|you know...
{74093}{74159}"Come down to this pub|at such and such and that,"
{74160}{74217}and I thought they were|gonna do me over
{74218}{74298}'cause I didn't turn up to one|of Rotten's parties or something.
{74299}{74364}He gets touchy|over things like that.
{74365}{74423}And... I went down there|and he said,
{74424}{74468}"Do you wanna play bass|for the Sex Pistols?"
{74823}{74896}# Turn the page and it's|the scoop of the century #
{74897}{74981}# Don't wanna be I seven|I've had enough of this #
{74982}{75063}# This is brainwash|and this is a clue #
{75064}{75144}# To the stars|who fooled you #
{75177}{75217}Sid was my mate.
{75218}{75266}Very, very close mate.
{75267}{75312}He'd just --|Iaugh at everything.
{75338}{75422}Genius in that way,|and his name was John.
{75552}{75628}# I got you in the camera,|I got you in my camera #
{75629}{75713}# A second of your life|ruined for life #
{75714}{75782}We'd do lots of mad things|together, me and Sid.
{75783}{75836}We used to busk too,|for money...
{75861}{75917}Me with a violin,|Sid with a tambourine,
{75918}{76000}maybe a broken guitar,|doing Alice Cooper songs.
{76001}{76049}"l Love the Dead"|was our favorite.
{76050}{76098}That would get us|the most money.
{76099}{76153}"Just please shut up."
{76154}{76204}"Here -- take the money,|go somewhere else."
{76340}{76418}Why dost thou spit --|at me?
{76489}{76584}The best time of the band of all|was when Sid firstjoined,
{76585}{76669}and he was really determined|to learn the bass
{76670}{76708}and fit in and be part|of the band.
{76709}{76763}He definitely looked great,|Sid...
{76764}{76827}Yeah, he definitely was a face.|A real laugh.
{76828}{76884}He used to take the piss|out of Rotten.
{76885}{76936}All I did was cash in|on the fact
{76937}{77007}that I'm good-looking,|and I have a good figure,
{77008}{77055}and girls like me.
{77057}{77147}What do they want, a fucking|angel in flares and an anorak?
{77148}{77201}'Cause if they want that...
{77202}{77264}that ain't me, baby.
{77326}{77378}Found myself in this rather|curious little shop,
{77379}{77437}in the company of Johnny Rotten,|Sid Vicious,
{77438}{77503}and other assorted|Sex Pistols.
{77504}{77536}Hello, Mr. Nimmo.
{77703}{77755}And the last they heard,|a donkey had him cornered
{77756}{77794}up a back alley in Fulham.
{77870}{77938}After EMI dumped|the Sex Pistols,
{77939}{77984}A&M Records picked them up,
{77985}{78040}and staged a contract signing|ceremony
{78041}{78088}in front of Buckingham Palace.
{78089}{78159}Malcolm was honest|in one respect...
{78160}{78251}That he always said|he had no control over us.
{78252}{78291}And he didn't.
{78292}{78375}And a bloody good punch-up,|in a limo,
{78376}{78483}before a signing|was not really unusual.
{78509}{78563}It was a good fight, too.
{78564}{78612}"No, you're the biggest cunt,"
{78613}{78661}"No, you're the worst cunt,"
{78661}{78722}"No, you're the cunt,"|et cetera, et cetera.
{78723}{78792}There was only one cunt|I wanted to smack,
{78793}{78859}and that was Malcolm.|Then the door opened,
{78860}{78908}and then we had to do|the signing.
{78933}{78979}At this point,|the Sex Pistols,
{78980}{79056}despite having been fired,|were not exactly suffering.
{79057}{79108}Here they were,|signing a new contract
{79109}{79151}that could make them|a lot of money,
{79152}{79223}and they already had a song|to record for A&M
{79225}{79276}in honor of the Queen's|jubilee.
{79277}{79352}Sid's father|was a Grenadier guard.
{79353}{79450}Imagine that -- Sid signing|a very, very expensive contract,
{79451}{79550}while his old man's on guard|inside the fence.
{79551}{79605}It was genius.
{79653}{79735}According to the story,|after this happy signing ceremony,
{79737}{79816}everyone went back to|the A&M offices to celebrate.
{79845}{79913}The four Sex Pistols|apparently overcelebrated,
{79914}{79964}and lived up to|their public image
{79965}{80019}of thorough obnoxiousness.
{80020}{80052}- How are you doing?|- Get away.
{80053}{80096}When we got to A&M records,
{80097}{80150}total bedlam broke out there|as well.
{80151}{80193}I can't remember|what happened,
{80194}{80239}but the secretaries|were terrified,
{80240}{80291}and Sid's foot|was bleeding.
{80292}{80373}I had a black eye,|Malcolm was running around,
{80374}{80439}Steve was flirting|with all the secretaries,
{80440}{80511}and then we got in the car,|then went to the studio,
{80512}{80571}where we were recording "God Save|the Queen" with Chris Thomas,
{80572}{80648}and there's this school next door,|and all the kids come running out
{80649}{80706}'cause we were there.|And they called the police as well.
{80707}{80751}It was just total mad day.
{80752}{80800}The next day we woke up,|Malcolm said,
{80801}{80857}"Well, A&M have fired you."
{80898}{80952}The anti-establishment|Sex Pistols
{80953}{81002}called in|the establishment press
{81003}{81048}to protest|what had happened to them.
{81049}{81123}We feel that we're like|some contagious disease.
{81124}{81165}When you walk|in and out of a company,
{81166}{81215}and the guyjust gives you --|"Look... Take this money
{81217}{81263}and don't come back."
{81264}{81317}What are you supposed|to think about that?
{81318}{81351}Have you had the money?
{81352}{81416}Yes, they gave us the check|last night.
{81417}{81480}Makes it very clear|where their heads are at...
{81501}{81521}Nowhere.
{81522}{81596}We weren't the nice boys|they thought we were.
{81597}{81646}We aren't nice boys.
{81647}{81714}We were fucking|nasty little bastards.
{81756}{81793}And we still are.
{81821}{81857}Virgin Records signed them,
{81858}{81895}and Johnny Rotten|got to record
{81897}{81950}his Queen's jubilee|memorial song --
{81951}{81996}"God Save the Queen."
{82033}{82082}You don't write|"God Save the Queen"
{82083}{82148}because you hate|the English race.
{82149}{82221}You write a song like that|because you love them,
{82222}{82305}and you're fed up|with them being mistreated.
{82782}{82852}# God save the Queen #

{85195}{85247}# We love our Queen #
{85272}{85318}# God saves #
{85521}{85583}I really don't think what he|was singing about was outrageous.
{85584}{85651}He's not saying "Let's kill her,"|or "Let's fuck her."
{85652}{85712}He was pointing out|what the truth was.
{85733}{85769}# God save the Queen #
{85807}{85855}# We mean it, man #
{85893}{85937}# There is no future #

{87292}{87356}It alienated|the entire country.
{87357}{87431}If they'd have hung us|at traitor's gate,
{87432}{87511}it would have been applauded|by 56 million.
{87605}{87686}You can't beat that, man.|That's National Gallery status.
{87731}{87790}It's raining silver|in "The Sun" this week.
{87825}{87870}"God Save the Queen"
{87871}{87948}was the alternative|national anthem.
{87989}{88044}What we offered to England...
{88045}{88072}was...
{88124}{88189}a pivotal point.|We were the maypole
{88190}{88243}that they danced around.
{88295}{88394}# Go away, I hate you,|hate you, hate you #
{88395}{88486}# Go away, I hate you,|far across the sea #
{88614}{88685}Where better to celebrate|the release of "God Save the Queen"
{88686}{88737}than down the Thames,|and start playing
{88738}{88769}outside the Houses|of Parliament?
{88770}{88862}"God Save the Queen," and|"Anarchy in the UK" on Jubilee Day.
{88923}{88978}I just wanted out|of the country --
{88979}{89029}and there was no way out.
{89103}{89160}Ever get the feeling|you've been trapped?
{89198}{89245}This is obscene,|the whole thing.
{89276}{89311}All of this,|it's bullshit.
{89347}{89407}Well, I've had enough|of your bullshit.
{89424}{89476}I'm too cold now.|I'm going back downstairs.
{89505}{89568}I loved it. I was getting|my 20 quid a week,
{89569}{89610}thinking everything|was great.
{89611}{89671}I didn't wanna fucking deal|with the business side of it,
{89672}{89713}I didn't really question it.
{89714}{89775}I was McLaren's friend|before the band,
{89777}{89838}so I trusted McLaren|like a friend.
{90202}{90280}# Too many problems|why am I here #
{90281}{90360}# Don't need to be me|'cause you're all too clear #
{90361}{90447}# I can see there's something|wrong with you #
{90448}{90521}# But what do you|expect me to do? #
{90522}{90605}# At least I gotta know|what I wanna be #
{90605}{90691}# Don't come to me|if you need pity #
{90692}{90776}# Are you lonely|you got no one #
{90777}{90858}# You get your body|in suspension #
{90859}{90916}# That's no problem #
{90944}{90998}# Problems #
{91028}{91136}# Problems|the problem is you #
{91137}{91199}The reason we're here|is because it's the Sex Pistols.
{91200}{91258}If it wasn't the Sex Pistols|there'd be no interest in this,
{91259}{91298}in this... boat tonight.
{91299}{91382}Look, we've got Richard Branson|looking like "Catweazel."
{91446}{91512}# They know a doctor|gonna take you away #
{91513}{91597}# They take you away|and throw away the key #
{91598}{91670}# They don't want you|and they don't want me #
{91671}{91749}# You got a problem... #
{91786}{91825}What happened to Malcolm?
{91869}{91938}# Problems, problems #
{91939}{92004}# Problems, problems #
{92005}{92050}# Problems, problems... #
{92177}{92241}# Problems... problems... #
{92328}{92380}# Problems... problems. #
{92453}{92525}We declared war on england...
{92526}{92603}without meaning to.
{92604}{92671}At eight, the Muppets'|"Halfway Down the Stairs,"
{92672}{92733}at seven, the Alessi Brothers|and "O, Lori,"
{92734}{92793}at number six,|Emerson, Lake and Palmer
{92794}{92841}and "Fanfare|for the Common Man,"
{92842}{92894}at five, The Electric Light|Orchestra, "Phone Line,"
{92895}{92944}four --|Stranglers and "Peaches,"
{92945}{92987}three --|Queen, "Lover Boy,"
{92988}{93046}and two,|Eagles, "Hotel California,"
{93047}{93107}the Sex Pistols' current record|"God Save the Queen"
{93108}{93160}is at number one|in the Capital Hit Line today.
{93161}{93237}But the IBA, which administers|the broadcasting act
{93238}{93310}has advised us that|particularly at this time,
{93311}{93368}this record is likely|to cause offense
{93369}{93411}to a number|of our listeners,
{93412}{93480}and have asked us not to play it|in our normal programming.
{93481}{93540}"God Save the Queen"|was never number one.
{93541}{93603}There was no number one|that week.
{93664}{93724}Whatever we were saying|and doing
{93725}{93815}really hit a nerve,|a raw nerve.
{93816}{93868}It was fucked up.
{93869}{93931}I still had to bunk|on the subways,
{93932}{93975}couldn't afford a cab,
{93976}{94069}and all of that the management|didn't want to deal with.
{94070}{94136}Completely|from there on in,
{94137}{94188}walking around|the streets of London
{94189}{94241}on my own,|was impossible.
{94242}{94313}I would be attacked|on sight.
{94328}{94414}You felt like a werewolf|being, like hounded.
{94477}{94558}Constantly in fear|of your life, really.
{94623}{94676}"God Save the Queen",|eh, John?
{94876}{94963}I got a machete blade|ripped down this leg,
{94964}{95047}and the blade stuck|in my kneecap...
{95049}{95102}and they couldn't|pull it out,
{95103}{95160}so I had to like,|walk off with that.
{95161}{95248}I got a stiletto blade|through my wrist here,
{95249}{95355}Iucky not to have had|one of my eyes gouged out,
{95357}{95421}'cause a bottle|was shoved in here.
{95422}{95456}Got to the hospital...
{95457}{95520}first thing they do|is call the police.
{95521}{95652}And I get arrested for|"suspicion of causing an affray."
{95653}{95722}And the telephone call|from the editor...
{95723}{95812}who would say, "Malcolm,|we'll print anything,
{95813}{95865}'cause you sell more papers
{95866}{95920}than we ever did|on Armistice Day."
{95927}{96005}It's 7:00 on Wednesday,|the 1 7th of August.
{96006}{96079}Elvis Presley, at one time|known to millions
{96080}{96120}as "The King|of Rock and Roll,"
{96121}{96178}has died suddenly|at the age of 42.
{96179}{96232}The king of rock and roll|died yesterday.
{96233}{96301}He was found face down|on a bathroom floor.
{96302}{96344}There had been|numerous reports
{96345}{96398}that Presley|was a heavy drug user.
{96399}{96440}All that time|when Malcolm was saying,
{96441}{96508}"We can't get gigs in the UK,"|we could have played abroad.
{96509}{96572}We could have fucking done that,|couldn't we, Julien?
{96573}{96671}Who needs the fucking UK?|It's a load offucking shit.
{96715}{96786}Got a lot of wax|in my ears today.
{96799}{96860}So we were left doing nothing.|I was just sitting there,
{96861}{96924}with -- Iike, we didn't even|fucking rehearse,
{96925}{96984}nobody wanted to fucking|rehearse or do anything.
{96985}{97068}So, like, you know --|it's a logical conclusion,
{97069}{97122}d'you know what I mean?|Boredom...
{97123}{97235}And, like, I'm that way inclined|so what do I turn to?
{97236}{97299}No, I couldn't take them off.
{97306}{97376}My nose is broken,|I'm keeping them on.
{97377}{97459}And she showed up with Sid,|and I was thinking,
{97461}{97552}"Who the fuck is this cunt?|This is an 'orrible person."
{97553}{97600}It was like,|the weirdest thing...
{97601}{97678}I'd never felt such|a negative energy from someone.
{97679}{97742}There was just a dark cloud...
{97743}{97809}Over this bird,|and I fucking hated her.
{97810}{97871}The first time|I came across Nancy,
{97873}{97930}I think Steve was shagging her|in the toilet.
{97931}{97988}I didn't like her.
{97989}{98064}Nancy was a hooker...
{98065}{98166}That was on the coattails|of the "New York Dolls."
{98208}{98289}And I actually introduced her|to Sid.
{98290}{98344}Shame on me.
{98379}{98460}In New York I was dancing|without any clothes on.
{98461}{98520}I used to go down to the guys|and dance in front of them,
{98521}{98566}and then get|tips off them,
{98567}{98610}and you'd do|a little hand job, you know,
{98611}{98671}for... ten bucks,|or they wanted to fuck.
{98705}{98752}I just -- you know...
{98781}{98843}did it, you know, I just --
{98844}{98885}there wasn't really|anything to it,
{98886}{98950}I just give good blowjobs.
{99011}{99067}"lt'll rip your balls off."
{99068}{99127}I read the first Sex Pistols|review,
{99128}{99187}which was shit, and I said,|"l gotta get over there."
{99189}{99256}I wanted to see|something exciting.
{99270}{99388}Nancy, as his heroin dealer/|girlfriend...
{99389}{99506}Was pumping him up with gear|every chance she could get.
{99507}{99567}He didn't like me|'cause I was ajunkie.
{99568}{99643}He tried to keep me and Sid|apart for months,
{99644}{99688}months, months.
{99689}{99760}Everyone knows when a bird|starts poking her nose
{99761}{99827}into a rock and roll band,|that it's suicidal.
{99828}{99886}'Cause that's when he really|started getting fucked up,
{99887}{99934}and not caring about playing.
{99935}{99977}And I didn't want|anything to do with her.
{99978}{100025}We did everything|to get rid of Nancy
{100026}{100078}that was physically|possible.
{100079}{100127}I even dangled her
{100129}{100206}out of a window one night,|by her ankles.
{100207}{100271}And the rest of the band|hated me...
{100272}{100328}'cause I was with|the New York Dolls --
{100329}{100379}Johnny and Jerry,|and they were junkies.
{100380}{100420}# Fix #
{100421}{100477}# My baby... #
{100621}{100677}They definitely brought|a lot of heroin around, too.
{100678}{100755}And I know Sid was totally into|Johnny Thunders.
{100756}{100806}I like the New York Dolls,
{100807}{100895}'cause they were nasty and mean,|and they wore makeup,
{100896}{100935}and they didn't|give a shit.
{100936}{100990}And they played|godawful rock and roll.
{100991}{101056}And they had good names,|and good hairdos.
{101057}{101113}It definitely had|a big effect on me.
{101114}{101160}I thought he was|the coolest thing ever --
{101161}{101202}Thunders, at that time.
{101203}{101251}I started stealing|some of his stances,
{101253}{101305}and his looks, and, you know,|his moves on stage.
{101306}{101367}I look back at it now,|and I'm embarrassed
{101369}{101428}at how much I fucking was trying|to copy him.
{101429}{101492}I didn't need to do that.|I had my own thing already.
{101493}{101556}My invention|to the Sex Pistols
{101557}{101600}was the hanky on the head.
{101622}{101696}It was kind offunny, actually,|when I used to see fans doing it,
{101697}{101757}I thought, "Oh, look, they're|doing something I invented."
{101758}{101807}Cunt, shit, bollocks.
{101808}{101854}Bill Grundy's a poof!
{101855}{101921}Because I've made my self-esteem|rise an inch.
{101955}{102032}Leatherjackets|came with the heroin.
{102033}{102132}Vampirish goth look|came with the heroin.
{102133}{102188}This ruined Sid...
{102189}{102246}Here, want one of these?
{102247}{102316}Because he was a complete|gullible fashion victim.
{102337}{102423}Sid went straight into the worst|kind of rock and roll idiot
{102424}{102484}you could ever hope to have|a nightmare about.
{102521}{102583}He didn't get that|what we were doing was --
{102584}{102641}Who wants|some safety pins?
{102642}{102694}Our culture,|our life.
{102741}{102779}Who else wants|something?
{102781}{102841}Come on if you want|something, you cunts!
{102894}{102982}Alls I can tell you is yes,|I can take on England,
{102983}{103055}but I couldn't take on|one heroin addict.
{103057}{103122}Oh, look, Sid.
{103202}{103270}At a time where we should have|been the tightest,
{103271}{103328}it couldn't be looser.
{103483}{103563}# There's no point in asking,|you'll get no reply #
{103564}{103647}# Oh, just remember|I don't decide #
{103649}{103725}# I got no reason,|it's all too much #
{103726}{103793}# You'll always find us #
{103842}{103892}# Out to lunch #
{103940}{104018}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty #
{104049}{104098}# We're vacant #
{104099}{104152}It's a pity in a way.|All these rich kids...
{104153}{104233}Becoming punks.|I find that revolting.
{104234}{104276}It's like an army now,
{104277}{104354}a faction -- chic.
{104355}{104402}I'm not chic.
{104403}{104462}I could never be chic.
{104463}{104515}I was in it|from its inception.
{104516}{104597}# There's no point in asking,|you'll get no reply #
{104598}{104683}# Just remember|I don't decide #
{104685}{104713}The punks ruined it...
{104714}{104820}They adopted a uniform image|in attitude,
{104821}{104915}and the whole thing|was about being yourself.
{104972}{105056}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty... #
{105057}{105127}# Ah... vacant #
{105142}{105232}The cliche punk look|which became the postcard punk
{105233}{105303}with a Mohican, and all black,|with spiky hair and all that.
{105304}{105350}It was never like that|to start with.
{105351}{105402}They didn't have|the money
{105403}{105449}to go out and buy|a 50 quid leatherjacket
{105450}{105520}it was very much a do-it-yourself|kind of thing, you know?
{105548}{105600}# ...and we don't care #
{105654}{105706}And all those garbage,|trashy bands --
{105707}{105768}basically all saying,|"Yeah, we're a punk band,"
{105769}{105881}wrecked it outright.|It became acceptable --
{105882}{105943}absorbed back into|the system.
{105944}{105993}The shitstem.
{106069}{106128}# We're pretty... #
{106136}{106174}# Pretty vacant #
{106175}{106197}I'm a punk!
{106198}{106262}# And we don't care! #
{106372}{106419}Mummy, mummy, come quick!
{106450}{106489}They've killed Bambi!
{106531}{106590}"Who killed Bambi"|was Malcolm's idea.
{106591}{106672}We were musicians.|We didn't want to make a film.
{106702}{106773}Malcolm was very good at|spending other people's money.
{106774}{106829}But there was a load|being put into the film
{106830}{106896}from the band's royalties,|which we didn't know about.
{106968}{107038}I rememberjust turning up|to do a scene...
{107039}{107092}there was this guy there, I thought,|"Oh, he looks familiar..."
{107093}{107156}Do you know the way|to Hindley Airfield, mate?
{107157}{107200}And I said,|"l know you from somewhere,"
{107201}{107241}and it was Sting.
{107242}{107314}It was his motion picture debut,|I believe.
{107315}{107379}So it's flying lessons|you're after, is it?
{107409}{107518}Well, you've come|to the right place, Sex Pistol.
{107519}{107570}Be advised,|drummer boy...
{107571}{107659}We're the sensational|new Blow Waves,
{107660}{107716}and we know how to sell|more records
{107717}{107768}than Malcolm McLaren.
{107769}{107820}And I knew|that it was just trash,
{107821}{107902}rubbishing|the whole point and purpose.
{107903}{107963}We believe|in rock and roll,
{107964}{108030}and we don't need you,|Sex Pistol.
{108031}{108079}The record companies know
{108080}{108125}that our music|means more to them
{108126}{108184}than your sick anarchy|ever did.
{108185}{108228}Get out of my car,|you cunts!
{108229}{108279}He used to really|get the hump, McLaren,
{108280}{108324}when we started asking|for money,
{108325}{108365}so I stopped asking for it.
{108366}{108426}We never had our own lawyer,|which is insanity.
{108427}{108511}That's the closest thing to being|in one of these boy bands --
{108513}{108568}is that they all get reamed,
{108569}{108643}and we were getting reamed|in that department.
{108644}{108718}How can you be a Sex Pistol|with no money?
{108719}{108801}You ring the office,|you get zero response,
{108802}{108875}your checks weren't paid,
{108876}{108980}no rent, no earnings,|a complete disaster.
{108981}{109088}It was wonderful.|"God Save the Queen"!
{109089}{109152}It was a monkey's tea party.
{109153}{109212}What the fuck|was the manager doing?
{109213}{109295}The one that claimed that|he was manipulating everything --
{109296}{109355}manipulated nothing.
{109356}{109416}He was clueless at that point.
{109417}{109473}Once we said,|"We're fucking leaving the group
{109474}{109556}unless you fucking get us some gigs,|you stupid little cunt,"
{109557}{109613}he got something together|the next day.
{109614}{109665}Well, he could have done that|all the time.
{109666}{109759}"Spots" was a good one --|Sex Pistols on tour.
{109760}{109822}But I thought it was dreadful|that we had to, like,
{109823}{109904}not be ourselves, and go|under secret monikers.
{109905}{109981}I'm a Sex Pistol,|and that's it.
{110122}{110186}And we just did these secret|gigs in the small clubs,
{110187}{110264}and it was just packed with fans|who'd never seen us.
{110265}{110306}And they were like|the best shows, man.
{110307}{110352}They were fucking great.
{110524}{110596}# A cheap holiday|in other people's misery #
{110747}{110821}# I don't want a holiday|in the sun #
{110822}{110899}# I wanna go|to the new Belsen #
{110900}{110974}# I wanna see some history #
{110975}{111046}# 'Cause now I got|a reasonable economy #
{111047}{111128}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{111129}{111209}# Now I got a reason,|and I'm still waiting #
{111210}{111284}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{111285}{111344}# To be waiting #
{111344}{111403}# The berlin wall #
{111594}{111697}I thought "Holidays in the Sun"|was our crowning glory.
{111761}{111843}# Sensurround sound|in a two-inch wall #
{111844}{111924}# I was waiting|for the communist call #
{111925}{112007}# I didn't ask for sunshine|and I got World War Ill #
{112008}{112097}# I'm looking over the wall|and they're looking at me #
{112098}{112164}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{112165}{112246}# Now I got a reason,|and I'm still waiting #
{112247}{112325}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{112326}{112375}# To be waiting #
{112376}{112431}# The Berlin Wall #
{112749}{112824}Huddersfield, I remember|very fondly.
{112825}{112891}Two concerts, a matinee,
{112892}{112972}with children|throwing pies at me,
{112972}{113071}and later on that night,|striking union members.
{113072}{113131}It was heaven.
{113132}{113196}He wants dad back at work,
{113197}{113268}which I think|is a very good idea, indeed.
{113269}{113315}It was like|our Christmas party, really.
{113316}{113370}I remember everyone being|really relaxed that day.
{113371}{113423}Everyone was getting on|really well,
{113424}{113473}and everyone|was in such a great mood.
{113474}{113527}'Cause it was a benefit|for the kids
{113528}{113586}offiremen who were on strike|around that time,
{113587}{113638}and who'd been on strike|for a long time.
{113639}{113693}And I've written|to Santa Claus today,
{113694}{113746}and I have got you|a skateboard.
{113747}{113800}Lot of love in the house,
{113801}{113877}and Sid was great that day.
{113878}{113971}Everything about it|was just wonderful.
{114013}{114109}Okay, gang, this party|is given to you absolutely free
{114110}{114179}and at the expense|of the Sex Pistols,
{114180}{114225}so let's have a big cheer|for the Sex Pistols.
{114226}{114258}Come on, let's hear you!
{114673}{114743}# She was a girl|from Birmingham #
{114744}{114817}# She just had an abortion #
{114818}{114896}# She was a case|of insanity #
{114896}{114974}# Her name was pauline,|she lived in a tree #
{114975}{115046}# She was a no one|who killed her baby #
{115047}{115125}# She sent her letter|from the country #
{115126}{115191}# She was an animal #
{115192}{115265}# She was a bloody disgrace #
{115266}{115332}# Body #
{115332}{115391}# I'm not an animal #
{115425}{115494}# Body #
{115495}{115542}# I'm not an animal #
{115575}{115634}It's not a question|of an Ml5 blacklist,
{115635}{115701}there are certain groups|whom we do not regard with favor,
{115702}{115763}and whom I personally will do|everything I can
{115764}{115820}within the law to prevent|ever coming to London again.
{115821}{115892}# Fuck this and fuck that #
{115893}{115973}# Fuck it all|and fuck the fucking brat #
{115974}{116052}# She don't want a baby|who looks like that #
{116053}{116129}# I don't want a baby|who looks like that #
{116130}{116189}# Body #
{116190}{116239}# I'm not an animal #
{116284}{116355}# Body #
{116356}{116400}# An unborn kid #
{116436}{116479}# An animal #
{116509}{116560}# I'm not an animal #
{116590}{116639}# I'm not an animal,|an animal #
{116640}{116702}# I'm not an animal|I ain't no animal #
{116744}{116786}# I'm not a body #
{116822}{116888}# I'm not an animal,|an animal #
{116889}{116949}# I ain't no an animal|I'm not an animal #
{116950}{116993}# I'm not an animal... #
{116994}{117040}# Mommy! #
{117241}{117299}I think that was|our last gig in England.
{117332}{117379}- Who's this?|- Sex Pistols.
{117380}{117411}Sid Vicious?
{117412}{117444}Yes.
{117445}{117512}This is Rodney Bingenheimer|from "Rodney on the Roq" show.
{117512}{117587}Oh, hi, man.|No future.
{117588}{117654}Is Johnny Rotten there?
{117655}{117723}- Yeah.|- Hey, how are you doing?
{117724}{117769}I'm doing all right.
{117770}{117836}You'll be coming to America|soon, won't you?
{117837}{117895}Get work,|move to California.
{117896}{117964}- Come to California|- It's the best.
{117964}{118015}Oh, I don't know...
{118016}{118077}Can you get egg and chips?
{118078}{118138}You can do anything|you want here, man.
{118183}{118242}No one is repressed in L.A.
{118243}{118327}Oh, yes you are.|Mentally repressed, dear.
{118328}{118393}Right -- that's true.
{118461}{118521}This week on Don Kirshner's|Rock Concert...
{118522}{118565}The incredible Kansas...
{118566}{118628}Family Funk|from the Sylvers...
{118629}{118710}The outrageousness|of the Sex Pistols.
{118711}{118778}Some slick dealing|from Ricky Jay,
{118779}{118850}and funnyman|Robert Aguayo.
{118885}{118932}We had trouble|getting our visas
{118932}{118987}'cause we had criminal records,|all of us.
{118988}{119048}They strip-searched us|at the airport,
{119049}{119139}and thank god Sid was|the first one they strip-searched,
{119140}{119227}'Cause as soon as they've seen|his underwear...
{119228}{119279}That was it,|we were safe.
{119280}{119372}They had no wish to play
{119373}{119439}with the rest of our willies|after that point.
{119446}{119483}Across the globe
{119484}{119571}they achieved a notoriety|in 19 languages.
{119572}{119667}In the city, voted|"Young businessmen of the year"
{119668}{119711}by the lnvestors' Review.
{119712}{119778}On Fleet Street,|they sold more papers
{119779}{119824}than the Armistice.
{119825}{119883}They didn't care|about the music --
{119884}{119945}they were purely into chaos.
{119946}{119997}Security was tight|for the arrival
{119998}{120087}of the infamous punk rock group|known as the Sex Pistols,
{120088}{120152}that naughty bunch|of counter-culture radicals.
{120153}{120200}Warner records had warned
{120201}{120264}that the group might attack|members of the American Press,
{120265}{120310}but when Steve Jones,|Paul Cook,
{120311}{120372}Johnny Rotten,|and Sid Vicious arrived,
{120373}{120428}this is|what they had to say...
{120482}{120516}Nothing.
{120527}{120572}Well, coming to America...
{120573}{120634}was definitely|a strange experience.
{120635}{120706}Ow-ww! Fucking kick me|in the fucking balls?
{120707}{120747}We had, like,|these bodyguards...
{120748}{120787}With walkie-talkies,|and that...
{120788}{120866}Continually followed by,|like, FBI
{120867}{120946}and fucking CIA,|and 50 journalists.
{120947}{120994}It was kinda scary.
{120995}{121072}And here they are --|at least two of them --
{121072}{121119}in a hotel room in Atlanta,
{121120}{121185}waiting for the other two|to do a promised interview.
{121186}{121228}But they're in|a strange mood...
{121229}{121311}Flaky -- demanding they be paid|ten bucks
{121312}{121392}before they'll do any|"bleep-bleep" interview.
{121393}{121445}Denied that,|they stomp off.
{121446}{121500}"Bleep," they say.
{121528}{121601}When the four young men left,|their spit was on the carpet,
{121602}{121639}their butts on the floor.
{121640}{121701}The dregs of an afternoon's|beer and booze,
{121702}{121782}and a couple of empty boxes|of Clearasil.
{121783}{121878}They left the hotel|to go to a sex devices store,
{121879}{121959}and then to their first concert|in America.
{122068}{122161}We didn't come from America,|we didn't understand America,
{122162}{122220}so how the fuck|could they understand us?
{122220}{122280}Okay, all you cowboys.
{122281}{122319}You faggots!
{122320}{122432}And I said, "You fucking|motherfucking faggot cowboys."
{122432}{122512}They were throwing|a rain of bottles and beer cans,
{122513}{122571}and pigs' noses,|and fuck knows what.
{122572}{122619}Anarchy in...
{122620}{122676}I got a full can of beer|smashed right on my lip.
{122676}{122709}The U-S of A.
{122710}{122781}Fucking big fat lip|with blood dripping down it.
{122782}{122840}The gigs were|pretty frightening,
{122840}{122905}'cause of all the publicity|that had preceded us.
{122906}{122960}People were coming there|just to see this freak show.
{122961}{123014}They thought we were gonna be|sick on stage,
{123015}{123068}crap on stage,|beat each other up,
{123068}{123129}kill each other --|well, it was partly true.
{123155}{123216}# I am an antichrist #
{123217}{123296}# I am an anarchist... #
{123320}{123368}Then Sid started|beating himself,
{123369}{123474}cutting himself on stage,|and totally being out to lunch.
{123475}{123528}# l... #
{123529}{123594}# Wanna be #
{123595}{123655}Birds were better looking|in America, that's for sure.
{123656}{123700}I really enjoyed|that part of it,
{123700}{123733}and they knew|how to suck dick.
{123734}{123787}They learn at an early|age here.
{123815}{123876}Sid loved the Pistols --
{123877}{123924}as a fan...
{123925}{124017}but being on stage with us,|he couldn't cope.
{124018}{124064}He wasn't being himself|anymore,
{124064}{124113}he was trying to be|Johnny Rotten...
{124114}{124165}with the drugs.
{124166}{124239}And that showed, I think,|to my mind, very bad.
{124318}{124391}The fucking Texas patrolmen|took me...
{124393}{124448}and threw me out the door.
{124448}{124489}And they have the authority|'cause they have a badge,
{124490}{124533}and they have a fucking|billy club and a gun.
{124630}{124695}Malcolm, he liked the idea|of Sid being outrageous,
{124696}{124758}however much it|fucked things up for the band.
{124759}{124832}I think he encouraged him.|I remember Sid saying once...
{124833}{124892}"He could never be|outrageous enough."
{124892}{124939}And Malcolm's going,|"Yes, yes, I agree."
{124940}{124995}"You can go mad,|go all the way."
{125028}{125091}It says to me that I should do|what I wanna do, you know?
{125092}{125146}And just fuck everybody else.
{125147}{125202}Just fuck everybody else,|you know? Just fuck 'em.
{125276}{125322}They moved me,|they made me shake
{125323}{125367}more than I've ever|shook before,
{125368}{125421}and that's what...|what makes them the best.
{125536}{125576}I think I heard one time|that they...
{125577}{125608}urinated on the audience|one time.
{125608}{125649}Why, I don't know.|Itjust sounds goofy.
{125650}{125706}- Get outta here!|- What are they saying?
{125707}{125750}Get outta here!
{125751}{125814}It's better than homework.
{125815}{125866}Get the fuck outta here!
{125925}{125970}You faggot fucker!
{126043}{126136}Yeah, the guy fucking tried|to climb up on stage
{126136}{126182}and fucking attack me,
{126183}{126262}so I smashed his fucking brains|in with my guitar.
{126263}{126320}He knew that I meant|physical harm,
{126321}{126376}and I have to say|I was ugly about it.
{126377}{126440}But he came out and hit us|over the head with the bass.
{126441}{126484}They were great.
{126485}{126550}If I could only make out|the words, they'd be greater.
{126551}{126609}That was my first time|in America.
{126610}{126704}Sid would sit next to me,|and we'd look out the window,
{126705}{126807}and we'd stare|at that endless scenery,
{126808}{126874}and imagine John Wayne|and the indians.
{126875}{126958}You wouldn't sleep.|You wouldn't want to,
{126959}{127034}because it was|so first time.
{127247}{127360}Steve and paul flew|around America with Malcolm.
{127360}{127410}Steven,|what kind of badge you got?
{127411}{127459}I don't know.|Safety department.
{127460}{127504}Safety department.|That's very good.
{127505}{127552}Say goodbye.|Say goodbye.
{127553}{127608}They didn't want to be|on the tour bus,
{127609}{127729}'cause they were "really bored|with that reggae, man."
{127757}{127815}Steve and Paul|are a pair of sheep.
{127845}{127907}They do what Malcolm says.
{127908}{127963}Sid was just|looking for smack,
{127964}{128032}and being an idiot.|Rotten got into his ego...
{128033}{128107}itjust got really depressing,|really quick.
{128108}{128176}But the point is,|Sid's my mate,
{128177}{128239}and I don't want him|to be ajunkie.
{128240}{128295}This is why we traveled|on the bus,
{128296}{128361}this is why Sid was to stick|with me,
{128362}{128404}and like, the others|just didn't understand.
{128405}{128481}They thought,|"Oh, you can handle it, man."
{128482}{128534}But, like, dope sickness|isn't like that.
{128535}{128588}It's not something|that you can just blow away.
{128589}{128658}It's the worst sickness|you could ever imagine.
{128659}{128743}He was far too young|for that shit,
{128744}{128828}and un-american|for that shit.
{128829}{128914}I can drink,|and I can drink a druggie
{128915}{128964}out of being a druggie.
{128965}{129036}And I will do that|for my friends,
{129037}{129105}every time, any time.
{129106}{129173}You can't get comfortable,|and you sweat...
{129174}{129250}and you're boiling hot|and you pour with sweat.
{129251}{129305}And your nose dribbles and...
{129306}{129360}and all of a sudden|you get the colds,
{129360}{129412}and the sweat turns|to fucking ice on you,
{129413}{129461}and you put ajumper on.
{129462}{129511}Then you're boiling hot again,|and you take it off, and, like,
{129512}{129581}you get cold again and, like,|you just can't win.
{129582}{129640}And you lie down,|and that's not comfortable,
{129640}{129692}you sit up, that's not comfortable.|It drives you insane.
{129693}{129748}I despise Sid for it,
{129748}{129860}and I'll despise anyone|for messing with it ever since.
{129861}{130012}It is the only drug that really|cancels out all creativity.
{130013}{130072}It is about self-pity.
{130072}{130180}It is the lowest,|worst form of life.
{130232}{130284}Well, he wasn't even playing|at the end.
{130285}{130335}You know, he could barely|play it anyway.
{130336}{130376}Half the time he wasn't even|plugged in.
{130376}{130416}It was like ajoke.|It was like...
{130417}{130457}"What the fuck|am I up here for?
{130458}{130542}What am I doing with this fucking,|like, kind of circus?"
{130543}{130584}I just didn't want|any part of it.
{130585}{130651}In the end, like,|I was the only one
{130652}{130694}who had any anarchy left in me.
{130695}{130751}The rest of the band,|they couldn't fucking take it.
{130752}{130853}And then we got to, like...|Like I said, San Francisco,
{130854}{130924}and Malcolm's in town,
{130924}{130968}and Sid goes off|with Malcolm,
{130968}{131051}suddenly Sid comes back|smacked up.
{131096}{131140}Winterland --|the final countdown.
{131141}{131214}It wasn't|a rock and roll party.
{131215}{131260}It was more|like a dying horse
{131261}{131322}that needed putting|out of its misery.
{131347}{131404}But Malcolm saw it more|as a media circus.
{131405}{131459}He didn't realize|what a great band we were.
{131460}{131520}This is KSAM|in San Francisco,
{131521}{131592}with the Sex Pistols,|live from Winterland.
{131628}{131708}Throughout the show, people|were hurling things at them.
{131708}{131774}From all over --|from above, from the sides,
{131775}{131823}from right down below --|and there were people
{131824}{131887}jumping up on stage|and being carried off.
{131888}{131927}The stage is...
{131928}{131972}Here they come.
{132026}{132116}It's not really impossible|in San Francisco
{132116}{132191}to have monitors that work.
{132192}{132225}...is it?
{132226}{132296}Is it impossible|to have a sound check?
{132297}{132335}No.
{132336}{132391}Here's the encore|of the Sex Pistols.
{132420}{132495}Malcolm would set it up|to look ridiculous.
{132496}{132536}We were all cheated --
{132537}{132621}audience...|and lead singer alike.
{132661}{132722}You'll get one number|and one number only,
{132723}{132770}'cause I'm a lazy bastard.
{132771}{132849}You have to understand,|they stayed in a very nice hotel.
{132850}{132894}This is "no fun."
{132895}{132989}Me and Sid were not allowed|in that very nice hotel.
{132990}{133090}We had to stay with|the road crew in a motel.
{133091}{133196}The sheer lack of respect...|for Malcolm --
{133196}{133256}and him not returning a call --
{133256}{133309}that was it for me.
{133395}{133448}It wasn't connived at all.
{133448}{133489}We got to our hotel|and booked in.
{133490}{133549}I wasn't aware that he didn't|get a room there.
{133550}{133603}So he ended up staying|somewhere else.
{133655}{133737}# No fun, my babe #
{133738}{133792}# No fun #
{133792}{133855}Malcolm was fucking|with me.
{133856}{133961}I had no credit card,|and no money, no ticket.
{133993}{134031}He was trying to wreck
{134032}{134112}the very thing that made|the Sex Pistols great,
{134113}{134174}and he managed to achieve it|that night.
{134175}{134247}# ...fun to be alone #
{134248}{134304}# ln love #
{134304}{134372}# With nobody else #
{134406}{134453}John came over,|and we tried to have
{134454}{134507}a "clear the air" talk,|and we said to him,
{134508}{134561}"l don't wanna carry on,|really much longer
{134562}{134627}the way this is going.|It's, like, just totally pointless.
{134628}{134672}Someone's gonna get killed,|you know?"
{134672}{134732}John said he thought|the problem was Malcolm,
{134732}{134795}and we should get rid|of Malcolm and carry on,
{134796}{134843}and try and work|it out that way.
{134844}{134921}# Fun to be alone #
{134922}{135009}# Walkin' by myself #
{135010}{135087}# Fun to be alone #
{135088}{135146}# ln love #
{135147}{135211}# With nobody else #
{135212}{135247}I didn't really|hang out with John.
{135248}{135315}He was always draining to me.|Took up a lot of energy.
{135316}{135410}Malcolm I got along with, so|I kinda went on to McLaren's side.
{135411}{135456}Another thing I regret.
{135457}{135516}# Maybe call somebody|on the telephone #
{135516}{135582}# Well come on,|my babe #
{135583}{135634}# Come on #
{135720}{135782}I'd have dropped Sid|in a second
{135783}{135841}at that particular point|for the band,
{135842}{135893}because I knew|he was fucking up.
{135894}{135928}# No fun... #
{135928}{135960}That's a load|of cobblers.
{135960}{136015}I was just playing bass,|and going crazy,
{136016}{136063}and leaping up and down.|And he thought I was trying
{136064}{136160}to take over his position|as the "New Johnny Rotten."
{136161}{136201}# No fun #
{136250}{136277}# No fun #
{136278}{136329}I don't wanna be ajunkie|for the rest of my life.
{136330}{136390}I don't wanna be|ajunkie at all.
{136502}{136572}I knew the second|Sid would smack himself up again
{136573}{136627}that was the end.
{136673}{136746}# No -- no fun #
{136747}{136800}# No fun #
{136800}{136881}# Alone -- no fun #
{136882}{136912}# By myself, it's no fun... #
{136912}{136963}I was the one who said|"l've had enough."
{136964}{136998}I couldn't|handle it any more.
{136999}{137071}I didn't want nothing to do|with Rotten and Vicious.
{137096}{137168}Oh, bollocks,|why should I carry on?
{137169}{137246}I regret saying|that I wanted out, and leaving.
{137247}{137300}I regret it,|I really do.
{137301}{137389}And I apologized to John|that I fucking bailed.
{137390}{137443}# No fun #
{137444}{137527}We might have continued|if we'd have got rid of Malcolm.
{137552}{137607}# No fun... #
{137608}{137655}But that's just|the way I felt.
{137656}{137722}And I couldn't get away|from my feelings at the time.
{137785}{137835}I knew it had to end.
{137836}{137884}I didn't think it would end...
{137885}{137977}with them being|total wanker cowards.
{138053}{138128}Steve and Paul|fannied out on me.
{138193}{138267}The last show was the worst show|I think we've ever played.
{138268}{138327}It was just like,|this ain't going nowhere.
{138328}{138405}This ain't going anywhere,|it's fucking over.
{138441}{138499}Cookie agreed,|and we just fucked off.
{138705}{138751}The night the group split up,
{138752}{138816}Vicious was pulled off a plane|at Kennedy Airport,
{138817}{138873}the victim of a drug overdose.
{138896}{138961}Despite all the hassles,|what was it that you thought
{138962}{139008}the Pistols were really|trying to do?
{139009}{139073}Was itjust like really kick|the establishment up the arse?
{139116}{139156}Sid?
{139157}{139256}Sid, he's not interviewing me.|Please try and wake up.
{139257}{139305}Ow-ww!
{139359}{139423}Sid, damn you!
{139468}{139512}Fuck.
{139587}{139647}Everybody was for Sid --|I mean, Sid was like...
{139648}{139701}I don't know if you saw|any of the gigs,
{139702}{139772}but Sid was like,|really shining out.
{139772}{139840}And John was being|like, nothing.
{139892}{139961}The only people... the only|two people that I can think of...
{139962}{140034}that I would like|to play with...
{140191}{140240}Sid...?
{140241}{140285}Oh, my God...
{140286}{140402}I feel nothing but grief,|sorrow and sadness for Sid.
{140403}{140447}To the point, like,
{140448}{140502}if I really like,|talk about it,
{140503}{140555}I just fucking burst out|in tears.
{140556}{140615}He was someone|I really cared for.
{140616}{140698}You see?|He's one of the Johns.
{140699}{140772}I care about every single one|of the Johns.
{140773}{140835}The gang of Johns|should have been the band.
{140836}{140908}- Wake up, Sid.|- Yeah, okay. I'm waking up.
{140909}{140950}Now what's|the next question?
{140951}{141012}I can't be more|honest than that.
{141013}{141077}Don't drop it|on me again.
{141671}{141748}Well, the room was...|very bloody.
{141748}{141816}There was blood on the sheets,|and blood on the mattress
{141816}{141882}there was tracks of blood|leading into the bathroom,
{141883}{141971}where the body of the female|was found lying under the sink.
{141972}{142028}She was stabbed|in the stomach.
{142184}{142241}The whole thing lasted|no more than three minutes,
{142242}{142299}and out they went.|Vicious made no attempt
{142300}{142356}to duck the cameras waiting|outside the courtroom,
{142357}{142434}but he refused to respond to any|of the reporters' questions,
{142435}{142494}and shoved persistent|microphones out of his path.
{142495}{142585}The grand jury will decide whether|or not to indict Vicious for murder.
{142586}{142676}If indicted, the case moves to the|Supreme Court for further action.
{142677}{142727}Vicious was ordered|to Ryker's lsland.
{142728}{142784}If convicted of the stabbing|death of Miss Spungen,
{142785}{142849}Vicious faces 1 5 years|to life in prison.
{142850}{142911}# No fun... #
{142912}{142984}Are you having fun|at the moment?
{142984}{143025}Are you kidding?
{143026}{143092}No, I'm not|having fun at all.
{143159}{143209}Where would you|like to be?
{143240}{143288}Under the ground.
{143321}{143362}Are you serious?
{143363}{143404}Oh, yeah.
{143714}{143778}I've lost my friend.
{143779}{143867}I couldn't have changed it.|I was too young.
{143868}{143929}God, I wish|I was smarter.
{143930}{144004}You can look back on it,|and go,
{144005}{144074}"l could have done|something."
{144075}{144149}He died,|for fuck's sake.
{144213}{144318}Theyjust turned it|into making money.
{144319}{144376}"Ha, ha, ha, ha..."
{144377}{144445}How hilarious for them.
{144446}{144490}Fucking cheek.
{144491}{144576}I'll hate them forever|for doing that.
{144708}{144814}You can't get more evil than that.|Can you, Julien? You know?
{144877}{144933}No respect.
{144934}{145001}Vicious... poor sod.
{145148}{145205}# No fun... #
{145236}{145285}# No fun! #
{145286}{145369}# No fun -- no fun #
{145370}{145430}# No fun... #
{145485}{145566}# No fun -- my babe #
{145567}{145620}# No fun #
{145663}{145744}# Fun to be alone #
{145744}{145829}# Walkin' by myself #
{145830}{145903}# Fun to be alone #
{145904}{145952}# ln love... #
{145976}{146059}And I said, "You fucking|motherfucking faggot cowboys,
{146060}{146128}you can throw any fucking thing|in the world at us,
{146128}{146177}and you won't get us|off this stage."
{146178}{146251}# Maybe goin' out|maybe stay at home #
{146252}{146322}# Maybe call somebody|on the telephone #
{146323}{146376}# Come on #
{146377}{146427}# No fun #
{146593}{146651}We gave it fucking 200 percent
{146652}{146706}for, like two years,|and that was it.
{146707}{146743}I think we run out|of steam.
{146744}{146794}You dirty fucker.
{146795}{146836}I loved being|a Sex Pistol.
{146837}{146894}I'll always be|a Sex Pistol.
{146895}{146945}But at least, you know,|when I die
{146946}{146994}at least I can say|I've done something.
{146995}{147036}# No fun... #
{147037}{147115}Press the self-destruct button,|and start again.
{147116}{147157}Which is what it|was all about.
{147247}{147288}# No fun... #
{147288}{147400}So creating something|called the Sex Pistols
{147401}{147480}was my painting,|my sculpture,
{147480}{147549}my little artful dodgers.
{147576}{147640}Are you still waffling,|Malcolm?
{147672}{147713}The Sex Pistols ended
{147714}{147804}at exactly the right time|for all the wrong reasons,
{147804}{147884}but the wrong reasons|were continued,
{147885}{147969}and people continued|to perpetrate lies --
{147970}{148013}about a reality.
{148158}{148195}Ah, ha, ha...
{148196}{148264}Ever get the feeling|you've been cheated?
{148264}{148308}Goodnight.
{148486}{148533}We did what we had to do...
{148534}{148585}and that's why|we didn't survive.
{148586}{148663}Only the fakes survive.
{148664}{148737}All I want is for|future generations
{148738}{148810}to just go,|"Fuck it, I've had enough,
{148811}{148860}here's the truth."
{148910}{148968}Infamy, infamy!

If I have four cookies and I ate two of them, what portion did I eat?
You had four cookies, and you ate two, and then you got to cross-multiply that.
Four, two, wait.
Four, two. Four, 20...
You ate f... you ate 50 percent of your cookie.
One of the saddest days of my life was when my mother told me Superman did not exist.
I was a comic book reader, and I read comic books, and I just loved them.
'Cause even in the depths of the ghetto, you just thought,
"He's coming, I just don't know when, because he always shows up, and he saves all the good people, and they never end up..."
I was reading, I don't know maybe
I was in the fourth grade, fifth...
My mother... I was like, "You know, Ma, you think Superman is up there?"
She said, "Superman is not real."
I was like, "He's not? What do you mean he's not?" "No, he's not real."
And she thought I was crying because it's like Santa Claus is not real.
And I was crying because there was no one coming with enough power to save us.
Every morning it's the same.
Juice, shoes, backpack, the morning ritual.
And with it comes the uneasy feeling.
No matter who we are or what neighborhood we live in, each morning, wanting to believe in our schools...
...we take a leap of faith.
In 1999, I made a documentary about public school teachers...
- Plus?
- Plus.
- What number's that?
- Seven.
- One plus seven equals?
- Eight.
...and I spent an entire school year watching them dedicate their lives to children.
It's Friday.
You need to start doing better on these tests, OK?
- So write these...
- These teachers embodied a hope and carried with them a promise that the idea of public school could work.
Ten years later, it was time to choose a school for my own children...
...and then reality set in.
My feelings about public education didn't matter as much as my fear of sending them to a failing school.
And so every morning, betraying the ideals
I thought I lived by,
I drive past three public schools as I take my kids to a private school.
But I'm lucky. I have a choice.
Other families pin their hopes to a bouncing ball, a hand pulling a card from a box, or a computer that generates numbers in random sequence.
Because when there's a great public school, there aren't enough spaces, and so we do what's fair:
We place our children and their future in the hands of luck.
- Are you good at school?
- Yes.
- Tell me.
- School's like, at first,
I was having difficulties at school, but then, that's because I wasn't coming home and studying.
And then that's when I just started to study and I started to pass.
And I stayed back one grade, and that was in the second grade.
Why did you stay back?
- Why?
- Because I was go...
'Cause my father had passed.
- Yeah? Do you remember that?
- Yeah.
- What happened?
- He just died.
He took drugs.
Thank you.
OK, see you.
Have a good day. Have fun.
- OK. See you later.
- Be careful.
OK.
And what was your choice in taking him in like?
There wasn't a choice. I mean,
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
You know, I made a lot of mistakes, when I was younger, with my kids.
I don't know what I would do without him, at this point.
What, you? He needs you.
Why do you need him?
I don't know.
I think we need each other.
I really think we needs each other.
I do.
And there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him. Nothing.
One, two, three, four.
We broke them up into thirds.
- Each circle represents what fraction?
- Three.
- Three what?
- Thirds.
Three-thirds. Three over three.
Someone raise your hand and tell me, what is 12 divided by two?
- Twelve divided by two. Anthony.
- Six.
I want to... Well,
I have a lot of choices.
I want to be a nurse,
I want to be a doctor, and I want to be a veterinarian.
How come?
Because I just love animals and I would like to tell...
I would like to help somebody in need.
How'd you get that idea?
I read books in the library.
When the Native Americans... came to the river, what was the difference between when the settlers have it?
The settlers... the settlers had put pollution in it and the Native Americans took care of it.
Good observation.
How do you mean "pollution"?
Because they would use... throw all of, like, they would throw all the paper endings to the river.
She chose her college and she wrote a letter to the admissions and asking them to allow her to attend their college.
- Already?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
She's already... she knows what she's gonna do.
So, what would you say to me if I was your classmate and I said,
"It's too boring, and it's too much work.
I just want to quit school."
What would you tell me?
Well, pay attention instead of being bored.
Just look at the teacher and find different ways to make the learning fun.
...two, three! Next.
Do you think that
Daisy could be a veterinarian?
Oh, yeah. If she wants to.
If she believes hard enough that she could do it,
- yeah, I believe her.
- But she has to go to high school and then college and then medical school.
College. Medical school.
That's a long time.
I think... I believe that's six, seven years, eight years.
- Yeah, in college.
- Think she can do it?
Yeah.
My dad's struggling.
He sort of doesn't have a job.
My mom's the one with the job, and my dad is trying to get a job right now.
Bye...
Good schools.
That's what all of us want, but sometimes I wish someone would tell me just what these words mean.
It seems that we all have different ideas on the subject, yet each of us feels that he has the very best solution.
Now, I grew up in the South Bronx in the '50s.
The school that I was supposed to go to was Morris High School.
If I had gone to Morris High School,
I would not be sitting here today.
It was a horrible school.
It was a failure factory.
I went into this business,
I mean, literally, straight out of college, the firstt thing I did was teach.
I went to the Harvard Graduate School of Education, majored in Education, and I came out and I was ready.
And I figured it was gonna take me all of maybe two and half to three years, if I, you know, wasn't on my A game, to straighten out education in the nation. And then...
You wanted to straighten out the education in the nation?
In the nation! It was just... it wasn't that hard.
I was like, nah, I figured it out.
I read the papers.
I understood, you know, what was going on.
This is '75, right?
I figured by '77, '78,
I'd have this whole thing straightened out. And then I ran into this system.
It seems to me we need a great deal more information.
What do you think, Mr. Rice?
I'd like to suggest a committee.
You could not find the sort of architects of why this thing was as bad as it was, and yet nobody seemed to be willing to really look at this and say,
"This thing is an utter failure."
I'd like for this country to have a real education president for a change.
I'd like to be the education president.
I don't ever expect to sign my name to any law that is more important than the Education Act of 1 965.
Our goal of quality education is on a collision course with the escalating demands for the public dollar.
Since 1 971 , educational spending in the U.S. has grown from $4,300 to more than $9,000 per student, and that's adjusted for inflation.
...passage of tuition tax credits...
We must address some very real problems.
...voluntary school prayer...
It is not just a money problem, but it is a money problem.
...and abolishing the
Department of Education.
So we've doubled what we spend on each child.
But double the money is worth it, if we're producing better results, unfortunately, we're not.
Since 1 971 , reading scores have flat-lined, and math is no better.
As yesterday's positive report card shows, childrens do learn.
The day of reckoning is here.
Do you like school?
- No.
- No?
'Cause sometimes math is too hard for kids, so kids say, "I don't like math!
I don't like math!"
And I say, "I like math."
- So you do kind of like school.
- Everybody says they don't like math.
And I... I'm the only one who says, "I like math."
What do you want to be when you grow up?
A recorder... like you guys.
Come on, Francisco. I don't hear you.
Francisco, that's
'cause you cut your hair.
I can use the spray.
Make sure you close your eyes.
Don't put it in your eyes.
I haven't been inside the school.
Describe it to me.
If I was to walk in the school, what kind of feelings would I have?
- What would I see?
- Walking in, you'll see a desk with a security guard. That's it.
You can go no further than that.
They're in the district that's the third largest overcrowded school in the Bronx.
Public education, you know, that's the only option we have here.
This is...
Kids look at the world and they make certain predictions based on the evidence they are receiving from their peers, from their parents and from their teachers.
From their perspective, the world is a heartless, cold-blooded place, because they realize they've been given the short end of the stick, and they don't know why.
Hi. It's Bianca's mom.
I'm around the corner.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
A, apple. B, bug. C...
Say it in sign language.
- D, dog. E... F...
- Hello?
Bianca, say it in sign language, with your hands.
Come on.
Come on. Push it open.
I never did envision having children.
It's... It's something,
'cause they grow so fast, and you just see so many different things with them.
- Mail?
- It's my song.
Oh, you have to read these out loud by yourself?
Yeah.
- When did she give this to you?
- Today.
I don't care what I have to do.
I don't care how many jobs L have to obtain, but she will go to college, and there's just... no second-guessing on that one.
"Take my apples, boy, and sell them in the city.
Then you will have money, and you will be happy..."
When you go to college, you learn, you get your education, and you don't get a job, you get a career, that there's a difference.
"...and the tree was happy."
In January of 2002, after decades of empty lip service and political bickering, it seemed for a moment that what had proved impossible might suddenly be possible.
Two men, a conservative
Republican president and a leader of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, were ready to put aside their partistan differencest for the sake of America's children.
America, the world's only remaining superpower, the nation that had put a man on the moon, was finally going to fix education.
And now it's up to you, the local citizens of our great land, to stand up and demand, no child, not one single child in America, is left behind.
It was a bold promise, and to make good on that promise, the architects of No Child Left Behind decided to measure every student in the country.
I understand taking tests aren't fun.
Too bad.
We need to know in America, we need to know whether or not children have got the basic education.
So now it's eight yearst later, and we have four yearst left to reach our goal:
1 00 percent proficiency in math and reading.
In Alabama, only 1 8 percent of eighth graderst are proficient in math, and next door in Mississippi, it's only 1 4 percent.
And it's not just Southern states.
New Jersey, 40 percent.
Connecticut, 35 percent.
New York, 30 percent.
Arizona, 26 percent.
And in California, just 24 percent of eighth graders are proficient in math.
When eighth graders across the country were tested for reading, most scored between 20 and 35 percent of grade level.
The worstt scores for reading are in Washington, D.C., our nation's capital.
So you're a kid, you're doing fine in school till you hit the fourth grade, fifth grade.
Between the fifth grade and the seventh grade, you see a huge number of minority kids go from being B students to D students.
Now, one of two things is happening.
Either the kids are getting stupider every year, right?
Or something is wrong in the education system.
But what do kids... So I'm ten,
I've been a good student.
I'm 1 1 , I'm a C student.
I'm 12, I'm a D student.
What do you think
I think is going on?
And I'm looking now, let's say,
I'm in the seventh grade.
I'm going nowhere.
No.
How was school for you?
It was good, but I'm one of the guys that dropped out of school because of money.
My dad, my dad was getting laid off every so often, and money was needed in the house, food was needed on the table.
I want to go to a medical college or a veterinarian college to study about people and animals, because I really want to become a surgeon.
Daisy's path to medical school begins with eighth grade algebra, which she'll need to take when she moves up to Stevenson Middle School.
By the time she leaves Stevenson, only 1 3 percent of her classmates will be proficient in math.
I might go to Stevenson.
My sister goes there and she says it's really fun, just that people make a big drama about it.
Stevenson feeds into Roosevelt, one of the worstt performing high schools in Los Angeles.
The way that the California public university system is set up is there's a set of 1 5 courses called the A through G, that you have to meet in order to be accepted into a four-year university.
Only three out of a hundred students at Roosevelt will graduate with the classes necessary for admission to a four-year universtity.
And 57 percent of Daisy's classmates won't graduate.
We basically know which students are gonna drop out in the next five yearst.
We know which schools they go to, and with just a little bit of digging, we can see them raising their hands and saying, "Help."
Dr. Robert Balfanz, at Johns Hopkins University, has been studying schools like Roosevelt.
He calls these schools, where over 40 percent of the students don't graduate on time, "dropout factories."
Balfanz began to see a pattern: in cities, suburbs and rural areas, failing elementary and middle schools, feeding poorly educated students into local high schools, where they last one or two years.
In his research, he found over 2,000 dropout factories.
Locke High School in Los Angeles was one of the worst.
In 2008, Steve Barr took control.
Between ninth and tenth grade at this school, they go from 1 ,200 freshmen to 300 to 400 sophomores.
So, we lose, you know, 800 kids between ninth and tenth grade.
They come in the ninth grade.
This school, the kids read somewhere between a first and third-grade reading level, and they've been pushed through the system.
This school's 40 years old.
I think about 60,000 people have gone to this school in 40 years.
Sixty thousand.
Forty thousand didn't graduate.
So over 40 years, this is the damage that this school has done to this neighborhood.
To be 1 5 years old and a dropout, they're not going to write screenplays.
Millions of kids are walking the streets who have no vested interest in living.
They dropped out of school.
They have no diplomas.
They have no skills.
And you could name the places where the schools...
You can talk about Detroit,
East Baltimore,
Camden, South Central, this has all been going, this has... since I was a child and even before.
For generations, experts tended to blame failing schools on failing neighborhoods.
But reformerst have begun to believe the opposite, that the problems of failing neighborhoods might be blamed on failing schools.
Bill Strickland has seen this firsthand in his own neighborhood.
- This it here?
- Yeah, this is Oliver High School.
He went to Oliver High School, a dropout factory in Pittsburgh.
Most of the kids had no aspirations.
They had no clue where they were going.
So this is the State Correctional
Institution in Pittsburgh.
That's where a bunch of my buddies are.
Rather than getting on with their life, the vast majority of the guys end up here or dead.
Sixty-eight percent of inmates in Pennsylvania are high school dropouts.
The state spends $33,000 a year on each prisoner...
...which makes the total cost of the average prison term $1 32,000.
The average private school cost $8,300 a year.
So, for the same amount, we could have sent a prison inmate to a private school from kindergarten through 1 2th grade, and still had over $24,000 left for college.
It's a very expensive hotel, man.
You gotta feed them three meals a day.
You have to provide recreation.
You have to provide security.
You have to provide medical care.
These guys don't pay taxes.
They don't work.
It's money that goes one way only.
I'm just so afraid for him.
I cries for him sometime,
'cause I'm just so afraid. I am.
I pray about Ant all the time,
'cause I know he can easily be influenced to do things that he shouldn't do, and it scares me.
He never knew his mom.
Think his mom had other kids, but Anthony doesn't know those kids.
My mom left me when
I was probably about eight, so my grandparents raised me.
Was school important to you?
No. It wasn't.
Hey, it probably wasn't because
I never had nobody to push me, you know, to talk to me about stuff, so it wasn't.
And your son?
He didn't... He didn't think school was important either. No.
He didn't.
But he did his thing, I guess.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
It's the worstt possible example of public stchooling in the United Statest.
You know, lots of districts have certain things wrong with them.
D.C. has everything wrong with it.
Good morning, my friends.
Good morning, Miss Thomas.
Well, are you excited about what we're gonna do today?
- Yes.
- We wanna get a good look at what middle school is gonna look like.
Kimball Elementary has been struggling.
But with a good teacher this year,
Anthony is showing promise.
Next year, Anthony's class will leave Kimball and move up to junior high.
This is Sousa. It's a middle school.
This is basically our neighborhood school.
So when our children leaves Kimball, they would automatically be enrolled in Sousa.
And we're gonna try to also...
Most will go to John Philip Sousa, which the Washington Post called "an academic sinkhole."
If Anthony goes to Sousa, odds are, he will enter high school three to five grade levels behind.
You wake up every morning and you know that 46,000 kids are counting on you, and that most of them are getting a really crappy education right now, and you have the ability to do something about that.
So you think that most of the kids in D.C. are getting a crappy education right now?
Oh, I don't think they are.
I know they are.
Within the last hour,
I signed a mayoral order to appoint Michelle Rhee as acting chancellor of the District of
Columbia Public Schools.
In 2007, the education world went into a frenzy over the possibility that Michelle Rhee and D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty could actually turn around the school district.
Just in case there was any confusion,
I am 37 years old, and, no, I have never run a school district before.
Fenty picked somebody who had never gotten a Ph.D., who had only been a teacher three years, hadn't been a principal, hadn't been a superintendent anywhere else, and said she was going to tear up the district.
All of the eyes in the country are now on D.C.
I think we have a strategy committee
- meeting later, right?
- Yeah.
- OK. I'll see you for that.
- OK.
Bye.
Michelle Rhee is the seventh superintendent of the D.C. schools in just ten yearst.
Each of her predecessorst promised radical change, and that this time, they could turn their schools around.
Lieutenant General Julius Becton, who was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Silver Star for heroic acts in battle, said he never faced a more difficult task than reforming the schools of Washington.
Remember, children first.
Failure is not an option.
It should be simple: a teacher in a schoolhouse, filling her students with knowledge, and sending them on their way.
But we've made it complicated.
Why is it that the same student who fails a proficiency test in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, can drive a mile south and pass a similar test in Enfield, Connecticut?
Here's why: The federal government passes laws and sends money to the states, but the states fund schools, too, and set their own, often-conflicting standards.
And there are more than 1 4,000 autonomous school boards...
...making school governance a tangled mess of conflicting regulations and mixed agendas.
You've got local school boards, people from the State
Departments of Education,
Federal Department of Education, district superintendents and their huge staffs.
The things we've done to help our schools work better have become the things that prevent them from working.
This whole collection of people, which is sometimes called "The Blob," like out of some horror movie, has been an impediment to reform.
No individual is necessarily to blame, but collectively, they are the Goliath of the system.
Central Office is this behemoth that all your taxpayer dollars go to, and it's what I lead.
It's this organization that I lead, that's the Central Office.
The District gives the Central Office a pile of money.
Right. The city government gives the
District of Columbia Public Schools, the Central Office, a pile of money, to your point.
And the Central Office then proceeds to screw everything up.
Michelle Rhee's first move would be to tackle the problems of her vast bureaucracy.
I mean, this district did not become the way that it is by accident.
There's a complete and utter lack of accountability for the job that we're supposed to be doing, which is producing results for kids.
Go, stop.
Go. Stop. Go.
This is only his second year there.
You know, firstt grade for him has been very horrible.
Francisco hasn't had...
He hasn't been that fortunate with teachers.
Maybe that attitude of him not liking school comes from that, I think.
His teacher is telling me that he has difficulty in reading.
The teacher said he wasn't being focused and this and that.
That he's at risk of staying behind, repeating firstt grade, which I don't understand, because I do work with him at home.
- Is this a bat?
- Bat or rat?
- Mommy?
- Rat.
- Mommy, this is subtracting?
- R.
- I don't have an "R."
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Sound it out.
- "...kinds of loads."
- Very good.
- "...this yellow car makes it go.
Go, go, go. Don't be slow.
- Beep, beep."
- Very good.
So when you stand there, what's the feeling of the place?
Why bother? You know, it's like, why?
Why are my kids here? Why?
Why do I have to go through this?
There's a lot of why, whys, and to the point where I get upset...
They have a van.
...and wishing I could do better for my kids.
- Right there?
- Yeah. Did you tell Mr. Saxon that Mommy said that she needed your folder?
- Yeah, and I got it.
- OK. So he said that was OK?
- Yeah.
- OK.
- We're stuck.
- It doesn't seem fair.
It's not fair, but this is where we live.
Yes, hi. My name is Mrs. Regalado, and I would like to leave a message for Mr. Saxon.
Thank you.
Yeah, I would just like to have a teacher-parent conference with him.
After lots of studies, we come down to just what most parents believe, and that is a good teacher is what's working and a bad teacher is what's not working.
Eric Hanushek has tracked the effect of individual teachers on groups of kids.
The difference between a really good teacher and a really bad teacher is one year of learning per academic year.
Students with high-performing teacherst progreststed three timest ast fastt as those with low-performing teacherst, and yet they cost the same to the school.
A bad teacher covers only 50 percent of the required curriculum in a school year.
A good teacher can cover 1 50 percent.
They gave a kid a video camera, and he put it in his book bag.
- What are we doing in here today?
- Nothing!
He videotaped kids shooting crap in the back of the room.
He videotaped teachers reading newspapers.
We had a teacher put a kid's head in a soiled toilet.
- Where's our teacher at?
- They mic me up live, turn on the television, and I see all of this going on.
So, the guy asked me,
"What are you gonna do?"
I said,
"I'm gonna fire these people!"
My staff is in the back of the room going like this, like,
"Man, you can't fire nobody.
You can't...
What, you can't say that."
I thought I was in charge.
Howard Fuller fired the worst teachers in the video, but was forced to rehire them with a year's back pay because of a provision in the teachers' contract called "tenure," which guaranteed theirjobs for life.
The idea of tenure started in universities.
It was meant to protect professorst from getting fired for arbitrary or political reasons.
In universtities, professorst are only granted tenure after many yearst of teaching and a grueling vetting process, and many don't receive it.
But for public school teacherst, tenure has become automatic.
Three, two, one. OK, children,
I've just been granted tenure.
So I'm gonna sit back and let Ralph teach for a while.
Class, in what year was one plus one?
The answer is The Amazing Ralph!
You can get tenure basically if you continue to breathe for two years, you'll get it, and whether or not you can help children is totally irrelevant to whether or not...
And once you get tenure, we cannot get rid of you.
Almost no matter what you do, you are there for life, even if it's proven you're a lousy teacher.
Are you gonna teach us anything, or are we just gonna sit here?
Just do whatever you want.
- I wanna learn from my teacher.
- Besides that!
Look, if we were talking about people who made Tastykakes, right, I'd say,
"Look, I'm worried that they might get rid of the poor people who put the squiggles on Tastykakes."
I'm sure it's a machine.
"They ought to be protected and we should make sure they don't lose their job, right?"
American educators, organizing into unions, on strike against conditions they consider no longer tolerable.
They used to be able to get away with paying women teachers very little money, because their husbands worked, and that's how teachers' unions started.
Teachers had little protection or recourse from a system that routinely took advantage of them.
Teachers organized because they're in that situation where they're infantilized and told what to do. And yet, in their classroom, they know they have these huge responsibilities, and so they said, "Look, how am I going to get the power?"
If you care about the students you teach, if you wanna make a difference in their lives, if you wanna advocate for what they believe in, you have to go where the decision-makers are.
Taken together, the two biggest teachers' unions, the NEA and AFT, are the largest campaign contributors in the country.
Over the last 20 yearst, they've given over 55 million dollars to federal candidates and their parties, more than the Teamsters, the NRA or any other individual organization, and more than 90 percent of this money goes to Democrats.
At the national level, the Democratic Party was a wholly owned subsidiary of the teachers' unions on education policy.
Now, at the state level, where a lot of policy is made, the Republican Party was also, and continues to be, very tied in with the teachers' unions.
We have often been called a special interest, and I will never apologize for that because our special interests are the students we teach.
They're worth fighting for with every weapon in our arsenal.
I kept running into this issue of,
Hey, you know what?
I don't think we can do anything unless we deal with the unions.
Nope, nope. That's off the table.
You can't even bring it up? No.
Why can't you even talk...?
No. Because it's off the table.
The mayors didn't wanna talk about it, the folks at the state houses, the governor, no one wanted to bring this up.
The teachers' unions, in general, have taken a position that I don't think is actually in their own interest, but the position that they've taken is that we shouldn't make any distinctions among teachers.
A teacher is a teacher is a teacher.
So, this is an evaluation process for all teachers.
It's called the Professional
Performance Evaluation Process, or colloquially the P-PEP.
And there are strict rules to replace a failing teacher.
It has 23 steps.
There is an initial conference at the beginning of the year.
Weekly assistance must be provided.
Then the observation has to occur, it has to be a certain number of minutes.
Then there's a post conference which needs to happen after the observation.
Over those 90 days, the principal must do three more observations...
If it isn't completed by January, you have to wait until the following year.
There's lots of forms and dates and deadlines that have to be followed, and if a single date is missed, for whatever reason, the entire process can be subject to grievance.
I don't know, it just feels like a strange...
...game to me.
Jason Kamras is not just a cold-hearted bureaucrat.
In 2005, he was named teacher of the year.
People like Kamras will tell you, there's nothing more difficult than the life of a teacher.
I saw this when I followed the teachers in my firstt documentary.
It was an incredible thing, their total devotion to the lives of children.
And I could see just how tough theirjobs were: battling learning problems, issues at home, and rules from the system.
One day it can be really good, and one day it can be, like, not so good, and then the next day it can be, like, horrible.
But the other thing reformerst and experts will tell you, often under their breath, is that their biggest obstacle to real reform is a contract with the teachers' union which ties their hands.
So if you wanna reward a really good teacher, who's kicking ass, knocking it out of the park, can you do that?
We, under the current contract, cannot pay teachers more based upon their performance.
- Why not?
- It's not in the contract.
The muscle and the zeal that built our union is still with us.
You are heroes!
It's very, very important to hold two contradictory ideas in your head at the same time.
Teachers are great, a national treasure.
Teachers' unions are, generally speaking, a menace and an impediment to reform.
I'm a superintendent.
I'm assigning kids over to a school.
The day I send them over there, I know they ain't gonna learn nothing,
'cause ain't nobody learned anything over there in 20 years.
You go into a school building, right?
And you go into this classroom where this great learning is taking place.
Then you walk right next door to death.
Teachers used to pass me notes,
"Make sure you go to room 222."
And the principal, who would be taking me around, before I go in, "OK,
Howard, I wanna tell you.
This is one of my, what they call 'two-80-T'."
What that is, is a provision in the contract that provided what we call the "dance of the lemons."
- And...
- The what?
"The dance of the lemons."
So when you have a system that's completely dysfunctional, you see good people do strange things.
In Milwaukee, they call it the "dance of the lemons."
Here's how it works.
Principals have their lemons.
These are teachers who are chronically bad.
They know it, the other teachers know it, the school knows it, but the union contract says you can't fire them.
So at the end of the year, all the principals get together and they do the lemon dance.
Fred gives Jack his lemons,
Jack gives Sally his lemons, and Sally gives Greg her lemons.
The lemon dance.
Each principal hopes the teachers he's stuck with at the end of the dance are somehow better than the ones he's getting rid of and that this year he'll finally be able to take his lemons and make lemonade.
Each state deals with this in a different way.
In some states, it's "pass the trash," others, it's the "turkey trot."
In New York, they have something else.
Tenured teachers awaiting disciplinary hearings on offenses ranging from excessive lateness to sexual abuse, along with those accused of incompetence, are sent to the reassignment center or what the rest of the world calls the "Rubber Room."
These 600 teachers collect their full salaries and accumulate benefits for spending seven hourst a day reading or playing cards.
They spend an average of three years in the Rubber Room.
Their hearings last eight times longer than the average criminal case.
The cost to the state of New York:
100 million dollars a year.
And none of this deals with the larger pool of teacherst who just aren't good at theirjob.
If, in fact, we could just eliminate the bottom six to ten percent of our teachers and replace them with an average teacher, we could bring the average U.S. student up to the level of Finland, which is at the top of the world today.
The state of Illinois has 876 school districts, only 61 of them have ever attempted to fire a tenured teacher, and of those 61 , only 38 were successful in actually firing a teacher.
Compare that to other professions.
For doctors, one in 57 lose their medical licenses.
One in 97 attorneys lose their law licenses.
But for teacherst, only one in 2,500 have ever lost their teaching credentials.
I actually know how hard it is to be a good teacher.
Then I taught English and I taught social studies, and I taught it to high school kids who were two and three years behind.
And after all of my preparation,
I was a terrible teacher for the first two years.
I mean, I was better than the other teachers, but we were all terrible.
We could not move that group of kids.
It took me three years to become a decent teacher before I really learned my craft, and in about five years,
I was a master teacher.
When Geoffrey Canada pusthed for change, he was met at every step by a system with an infinite power to resist and defeat his reforms.
So he joined a small group of teacherst and parents who were looking for solutions elsewhere.
In the early '90s, a few communities began granting provistional charterst to create stchoolst that weren't bound by the rules of the district or union contracts.
Do you know anybody in the fourth grade?
It's a free public school for...
It's a college prep charter school, completely free, over off the Marcy stop.
Charter schools were a controversial experiment: public schools with public money, but independently run.
When there's limited space, by law the school must hold a lottery.
Geoffrey Canada petitioned to start a charter school in the worstt-performing district in New York State.
We chose 97 blocks in Central Harlem.
It had the worst educational outcomes for children, and we came here because it had the worst.
These 97 blocks have the highest rate of foster care, and twice the unemployment rate of the rest of New York City.
Many experts believed that even the most motivated educators could not overcome the problems that these children brought from home.
But despite the failures of reformers before him,
Geoffrey Canada made a promise to the families of Harlem.
Your child comes to this school, we will guarantee that we will get your child into college.
We will be with you, with your child, from the moment they enter our school to the moment they graduate from college.
I grew up in the public school system.
I had a economics teacher, and that teacher refused to teach.
When you hear, "Well,
I get paid whether or not you learn or not," it sticks with you.
And that's something that no parent wants their child to ever be a witness to or to hear when they're going to school.
If I'm trusting you with my child and teaching my child,
I expect you to do the same job that you would want for your... for your own children.
And I just knew that I wanted her in parochial school.
Bianca's school is directly across the street from their home.
Every month, Nakia pays $500 tuition.
It's a struggle.
It's a struggle, but it's a choice that I made.
It's my responsibility to my child.
Her firstt year in school,
I had lost my job due to some layoffs, and I did all that I could and made sure that she still got her education.
One notebook.
Do you ever think if you sent Bianca to a public school, there would be less pressure with money?
I have given that some thought, but I revert right back to the same thing.
I'll just have to find a way.
There's nothing short of a firestorm surrounding the future of the D.C.
Public School system.
At the center of the controversty, new schools chancellor, Michelle Rhee.
D.C. School Chancellor Michelle Rhee will not name names, but more than 30 school principals are being terminated this week.
No shortage of outrage tonight among parents and teachers caught up in the district's plan to close nearly two dozen public schools.
Fifty-seven teacherst and 77 support staff are having to reapply for theirjobs.
Within a few months, the initial burst of enthusiasm for Michelle Rhee had faded.
She had cut over a hundred jobs in the D.C. Central Office, closed 23 schools and fired a quarter of all principals, including the principal of her own children's school.
Don't close schools!
Don't close schools!
If you wanna quickly become the most unpopular person in a city, you just tell someone you're gonna close down a school, much less 23.
We work hard every day to make sure those strengths are strong.
I'm not a career superintendent.
This will be my one and only superintendency.
So I don't have to worry about pissing the unions off and, you know, making this person upset or that person upset.
The bottom line is I don't believe that you are gonna be the leader who is going to take this school to... in the direction that we need it to go in, and have the highest expectations for the kids.
This scorched earth debate may actually make some people's career.
No, I'm terminating your principalship now.
May make somebody popular in terms of,
"I'm the change agent," but it's not gonna change schools.
We will not be moved!
We will not be moved!
There is this unbelievable willingness to turn a blind eye to the injustices that are happening to kids every single day in our schools in the name of harmony amongst adults.
Francisco? Francisco?
Good morning, sleepyhead.
Maria still hasn't heard from Francisco's teacher.
The old one is Spider-Man.
Francisco, tell Mr. Saxon to send Mommy your folder because Mommy wants to know how you're doing in school.
He said we don't need it.
OK, but remember Mommy needs to know if you're paying attention, if he's giving you stickers. Remember?
As I grew up going to college and was exposed to more, only then did I realize how much I was cheated as a child in my education.
This was the day
I came back from college.
My dad, because of the diabetes, has stopped...
He wasn't able to move too much.
That day, he actually danced a song with me.
For my father, education was everything.
It was like if he would've had gotten a chance, he would have become something in his life, rather than just a factory worker.
This is a fork, and it's not a "hork."
Right, 'cause "hork" isn't even a word.
That's a made-up word, but...
- "Horse" is a word.
- "Horse" is a word, and there you would use "H."
And what about this one?
Maria takes Francisco to a reading class at a nearby college.
Teachers are really overwhelmed,
'cause it's really hard to give each one that, you know, individualized attention.
So it's more work for them to have these kinds of meetings.
If they can avoid them, unfortunately, you have some teachers that will avoid them if they can.
Well, he's already been in two reading programs and teachers are telling me that he knows how to read, he's comprehending, and the teachers keep telling me that there's something with his comprehension.
- Have you taken it beyond the school?
- No.
You should.
If you want a better school for your kid, it's all about options.
But the system is confusing.
Let's say you live in a district with a hundred public schools.
Most are like Francisco's, not terrible, but not great.
A fifth will be failing, and more will be hovering between mediocre and failing.
There's usually one mainstream school that's defying the odds.
With a great principal and outstanding teachers, it can produce amazing results, but you can't go there unless you live in that neighborhood.
So, for yearst, unless you could afford a private school, you were stuck with your neighborhood school.
In the 1 960s, magnet schools were formed.
These were district-run schools to give families another choice.
Some were forjob training, some were for the arts and some were for academics.
But there aren't that many magnets, and they're very difficult to get into.
In the '90s, public charter schools emerged.
They're independent from the district, but open to anyone who lived there.
But only one in five charterst is producing amazing results, and so the numbers of families applying there are usually very high.
So a parent like Maria has to work hard to find a great school for her kid.
She takes a 45-minute subway ride across the Harlem River to look at a charter school.
One of the things that we've really put a lot of emphasis on this past year is reading comprehension.
So not just can they read the words on the page with fluency?
It's do they really understand what they're reading?
Freddy was...
So is the difference between the school down here and Harlem Success that great?
Yes. It's two different worlds.
"One Sunday morning, the wrong sun came up, and pop!
Out of the egg came a tiny..."
- Caterpillar.
- Do you know...
Every student who's behind in reading is assigned a tutor and has one until they're caught up.
How many books do you think you're gonna read by the end of the school, by the time school finished?
Probably like the same amount that I read last year.
- Which was what?
- One hundred and five.
Wow! Really?
I don't care if we have to wake up at 5:00 in the morning in order to get there by 7:45, then that's what we will do.
And do you start this at third grade or do you start it from kindergarten?
- Kindergarten.
- Kindergarten? Wow.
- That's what we do here.
- So by the time they get to third, this is easy for them. Yeah.
So if Francisco doesn't get in, is there another chance?
No. No, because he'll be going into second grade, and most schools, they only take kindergarten, first and second, so this is Francisco's last chance.
- Abuela birthday is in June.
- June.
Harlem Success will take 40 second graders...
...with 792 families applying.
Why don't we skip...
Now, can anyone tell us what a picnic is?
A picnic is where you go out in the country and eat food off the dirt.
Up until the 1 970s, American public schools were the best in the world.
Bob, you've been keeping your grades up. That's good.
The image of public schools in our films and TV reflects an ideal, that even if you're unlucky enough to be born in the wrong neighborhood, education could be a ticket out.
Mr. Vincent Barbarino,
I don't see any homework.
All right, so I didn't do my homework.
So 'scuse me for living!
Public school was not an ordeal we had to survive, but rather the single most important formative experience in our lives.
Since 1 900, U.S. public schools have produced more than a hundred Nobel laureates, ten presidents and countless numberst of great Americans.
Americans were really leading the world in educating its young people because we had sort of this free education system, and it was halfway decent,
40, 50 years ago.
We didn't really have global competition. I mean, we really didn't.
And everybody thought when Nixon opened China, right?
One of the... the time, you say,
"Look, you know what's gonna happen if we could just sell every Chinese perston a toothbrush? We'll make billions!
Why, there's just so many of them."
And we never realized that they would be selling us the toothbrushes.
Since the 1 970s,
U.S. schools have failed to keep pace with the rest of the world.
Among 30 developed countries, we rank 25th in math and 21 st in science.
The top five percent of our students, our very best, rank 23rd out of 29 developed countries.
In almost every category, we've fallen behind, except one.
The same study looked at math skills and found in these eight countries, the USA ranked last. But when researchers asked the students how they felt they had done,
"Did I get good marks in mathematics," kids from the USA ranked number one in confidence.
We might be overconfident, but if you look at the public stchoolst in our stuburbst, this belief that we're number one doesn't seem so wrong.
Inner city schools may be failing, but your kid's gonna be fine if his school has a new athletic facility, an art center and a closed circuit system for the principal to broadcast his morning messages.
Girls, when you're doing a water event,
I understand that you can wear a tankini, but not a bykini, bikini.
People move into an area, and they know they're paying a lot of money for their mortgage, for their house, so they assume that the school must be just as nice as their house.
Many of the kids are actually doing quite poorly when it comes to basic subjects like English and mathematics.
Redwood City is 30 minutes south of San Francisco, in the heart of Silicon Valley.
No inner city problems here.
The average home price is almost a million dollars.
When you bought your house here, did you think the schools would be good?
Well, we did, yes, we did. And as I say, when we first moved in, they were.
What side of the periodic table are metals found on?
Now you're asking me?
I can't answer that, love, it's been too long.
I'd say the top side, but I don't know.
There is no top side.
"On the periodic table, metals are found generally on the left side. True."
Emily Jones is in the eighth grade at Roy Cloud Middle School.
Now be a good girl.
What's that mean?
The bosses don't know their employees?
- Emily?
- 'Cause back in the old days when people had small businesses, there were only like five or six people working, but in the factories, they had hundreds and hundreds of people working, and they barely knew, like, their names.
Very good.
What's your favorite subject?
I'm not very good at math, but I think
I'd say it's my favorite subject.
Math and science.
I don't know what college
I want to go to, but I know I wanna be a teacher.
Woodside High, where Emily is slated to go next year, looks like a private boarding school, and Newsweek ranked it in the top six percent of American high stchoolst, but Emily and her family wanna go somewhere else.
Summit Prep is located in an industrial neighborhood.
It doesn't have the fancy facilities of Woodside.
It doesn't even have a gymnasium.
But over 400 families are entering the lottery here and hoping for a spot because of something else it doesn't have.
They all take the same courses through their four yearst, which means we don't have tracking, so...
...yeah, so we don't track the students.
So the school over there tracks and you don't. Why?
Because we think every kid should be able to get to the highest level of curriculum, so we want to hold them all to the same high standard.
Emily's probably not gonna drop out, and it's very unlikely she'll go to prison, but her test scores are low, which means the stakes for her next year are high.
Many families and their children are unaware that their academic future will be decided by a school official who will place them on a track.
Tracking is often determined by test results, but research shows that students are also tracked by arbitrary or subjective factors like neatness, politenestst and obedience to authority.
Lower tracks have lower expectations, and often worse teachers.
So students placed on lower tracks often find they are running fast, but falling behind.
As the years progress, it becomes increasingly difficult for those kids to ever catch up.
The high-performing kids, they often have special programs where they come through pretty well.
A lot of the kids who get hurt are the ones in the middle.
Eighty-seven years before...
Middle class schools suffer from the same dysfunction as urban schools, but because they attract more high-performing students, their test scores are inflated.
It averages out to a point where it masks the bottom
75 percent of students in those schools.
The California State Universtity system is designed to accept the top one-third of high school graduates, but most are not prepared.
They have to remediate 50 to 60 percent of all incoming freshmen before they can take college level classes.
Look at Woodside High School.
Out of 1 00 ninth graderst,
62 will graduate and only 32 will be prepared for a four-year college.
But at Summit Prep, out of a hundred students,
96 will graduate, and all of them will be ready for a four-year college.
To LA. We're going to LA.
You remember we're going...
Emily and her family have signed up for the Summit lottery.
The computer just randomizes the numbers in an order.
Say 54-A is like the 99th student to get into Summit, then they have a list of all the numbers who aren't gonna get in but who are on the waiting list.
- Was it 300... or 400 spots?
- Five hundred.
- For a hundred spots?
- Five in one chance.
- Well, we'll see.
- Yeah.
It's not like
Woodside High School is so bad.
Many families would be happy to send their kids there.
In fact, Woodside is doing the job it was designed for, 50 yearst ago.
The system of tracking fit the demands of the time.
Only 20 percent of high school graduates were even expected to go to college.
They would become doctors, lawyerst and CEOs.
The next 20 percent were meant to go straight into skilled jobs, like accountants, managers and bureaucrats.
And the bottom 60 percent would become workers, like farmerst and factory workerst.
There were jobs for everyone in the booming post-war economy, and schools like Woodside did their part to supply a useful workforce.
The problem is our schools haven't changed, but the world around them has.
Nowadays, you don't go to college, you're kind of screwed in America, you know, and America's kind of screwed.
At the end of 2009, the unemployment rate was almost ten percent, but the high-tech industry could not find enough qualified people to fill theirjobs.
Instead, they had to go halfway around the world to recruit the engineers and programmers they needed.
The only really proven thing to make an economy work well is to have a well-educated workforce.
You know, people get panicked about the economic success of this country.
Well, there's one thing that will determine that.
Bill Gates was so worried about the state of our schools, he testified before Congress.
We cannot sustain an economy based on innovation unless we have citizens well-educated in math, science and engineering.
If we fail at this, we won't be able to compete in the global economy.
We're not just lacking graduates in math and science.
By the year 2020,
1 23 million American jobs will be high skill, high pay, but only 50 million Americans will be qualified to fill them.
How strong the country is 20 years from now and how equitable the country is 20 years from now will be largely driven by this issue.
My parents actually tell me
I have to read 30 minutes and then I could go outside and play.
Go get it, go get it.
Has your mom and dad told you about the lottery?
No.
The lottery? Isn't that when people play and they win money?
Daisy and her parents have found one other option.
Eighth graders at KIPP LA Prep get triple the classroom time in math and science, and by the time they finish eighth grade, they will have doubled their math and reading scores.
You can see the trees.
You can see a building, a pole.
Judith and Jose have decided to enter Daisy into the KIPP lottery.
KIPP is a better school that they won't let you fail.
- They won't let you fail?
- No.
Good morning.
Mom! Everybody's going to school now!
- I know.
- I'm not graduating.
No, you're graduating.
You just won't be at the ceremony.
When am I gonna graduate?
Nakia's hours have been cut back at work, and she has had trouble making her monthly payments to Bianca's school.
Today is her graduation, and she's not allowed to go because I do owe some tuition, and they will not allow her to go to the ceremonies.
And...
It's enough that I have to explain it to her, but...
And I spoke to the principal about this and I asked him, why penalize her for my responsibility?
I can understand them not giving her her certificate or not giving her her report card, but to not let her be a part of the ceremony is just... it's harsh.
The Catholic schools, the scholarships are very limited or they're already used up.
They just said, then try again for next year.
I said, "Mommy wanted you to stay in your school," and she finished my sentence, she said,
"I know, but you didn't have enough money."
I said, "That's right."
I said, "But that was Mommy's choice to put you in that school, and it's gonna be Mommy's job to get you another school that's better."
Nakia is entering Bianca into the lottery at Harlem Success.
I'm very nervous.
We're gonna go over and we're gonna keep our fingerst crossed and hope that we get called.
When Geoffrey Canada opened the doors to his new charter, he saw kids that were two and three grade levels behind, and they brought with them other problems that middle class students didn't have: poverty, crime, troubled homes.
In his neighborhood, more kids knew people who had been to prison than had gone to college.
For decades, tests have shown an achievement gap between rich and poor children, and that over time, despite everything we've tried, nothing seems to make it any better.
Even progressive educators began to believe that the gap could never be closed.
And for those of us who drive by these schools, maybe we make the same dark assumption, that those kids, the ones in the poorest neighborhoods, just can't learn.
One-eight-seven.
In 1 947, many felt that the sound barrier could never be broken.
Even men of science believed that our fastest planes would break apart when they approached the speed of sound.
The glass would shatter and the metal would shred.
It was a belief that kept many a pilot on the ground and science from moving forward, until Chuck Yeager.
About half of the engineerst gave us no chance at all of ever successfully flying beyond the speed of sound.
They said it's a so-called barrier, and the airplane would, you know, go out of control or disintegrate.
I didn't look at it that way.
Almost everybody who comes in to do school, they come in and try to save kids after they're lost.
Having seen firstthand the failures of reformers before him,
Geoffrey Canada knew he had to rethink the way a school worked in a troubled neighborhood.
At the same time in Houston,
David Levin and Mike Feinberg were two frustrated teachers looking for another way.
Across the hall from Levin was a veteran teacher named Harriet Ball.
Break it down and show me how you choose for these other measures
How do you choose for these other measures? Like the liter.
She noticed that her kids had trouble learning math terms, but could memorize a rap song.
It doesn't matter how heavy it is
So she turned her multiplication tables into a song.
I'm a mathbook that I left on the...
She called them "disposable crutches," and she said,
"Once I have the basics in that way, in an enjoyable way," and the kids would sort of sing these songs out in the playground,
"then I can move to the next step."
For Levin and Feinberg, it was nothing short of a revelation.
Can you count by seven?
- Yes!
- Let's do it.
Seven, 14, 21 ...
They studied Ball's methods, and drew from other teaching practices, and opened two new schools called KIPP Academy, one in Houston and the other in the Bronx.
Against the advice of skeptics, Geoffrey
Canada laid out an ambitious vision for a school that would go far beyond what others had tried.
We said, "What if we never let our kids get behind?"
He created an educational pipeline, which started at birth...
Can I give you a flyer on The Baby College?
...following each child through every stage of their development, whatever it took.
Eight, 16, 24, 32, 40.
Both KIPP and Canada used the same fundamentals.
They increased classroom hours, held school on Saturdays and even in the summertime...
- Does everybody agree with that?
- Yes.
...put relentless focus on achievement with a singular emphasis on a pathway to college...
Could you hand me the dissecting needle, please?
Right from the start, there is a "No excuse."
"We expect you all to perform at high levels."
And everybody cares about this. Everybody.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
What's up with this?
It's a whole new look.
I'm going to gym.
That scientists have discovered you can avoid...
...and the results have been staggering.
The top charter schools are sending over 90 percent of their kids to four-year colleges, because when you get the culture right, and the teachers are helping each other out, and that long school day means that that is the primary thing that student is engaged in, it works.
KIPP Academy has been named the highest-performing middle school in the entire Bronx.
Congratulations, Kippsters.
- Austin!
- Texas!
But the experts refused to accept that this was anything more than a few charismatic leaders, an idea that could never be repeated or brought to scale.
Sixteen yearst later, there are 82 KIPP schools across the country, each in low-income, under-performing neighborhoods, including KIPP LA Prep, where Daisy is applying.
You can't beat their data.
We have now data from the first thousand kids who have gone through four years of KIPP.
Those kids have gone from the 32nd to the 60th percentile in reading, and from the 40th to the 82nd percentile in math.
We have never had those kinds of gains for low-income kids.
I want somebody to come up and draw three quarters for me.
In Geoffrey Canada's program, there are 8,000 students.
In a neighborhood where less than one out of ten residents have a college degree, nine out of ten are proficient in math and are on track to go to a four-year college.
Twenty-five years ago, there was no proof that something else worked.
Well, now we know what works.
We know that it's just a lie that... that disadvantaged kids can't learn.
We know that if you apply the right accountability standards, you can get fabulous results.
So why would we do something else?
Brilliant. What, you could be one of my teachers.
When you finish, and you get your college degree, come work for me.
You can help us teach math, all right?
The students at KIPP and Geoffrey Canada's schools don't just do better than other poor kids.
They do better than everyone, closing the achievement gap and shattering the myth that those kids can't learn.
Anthony's class visits the SEED School, the firstt urban public boarding school in the country.
I'm sure a mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, grandparent, neighbor, someone has taken an interest in you and someone loves you, and they recognize the importance of education.
To come to SEED, geography and luck, that's it.
You have to live in the district, and we have to pull out a bingo ball, call your number.
You can actually have posters on your side of the room.
- You can decorate however you want.
- This is like a college.
Yes, this is like a college.
This is exactly...
And so because you're in a boarding school, by the time you get ready to go to college, you will already know what it's gonna be like.
If I get into SEED,
I'm gonna have seven classes.
Gotta wake up early, usually, and then you gotta wear ties and stuff.
No TV...
...no games, no nothing.
So you hoping you get in, or you hoping you don't get in?
It's bittersweet to me if I get in.
They give me a better chance in life, but if I don't,
I just be with my friends.
One, two...
Where are you? 'Sup with you?
In a way I want him to get in, buts another part of me really don't want him to get in.
Why?
Because he'll be gone all that time, but I want him to go.
A part of me wants him to go.
What are the odds of getting in?
I don't know.
I wanna go to college and get an education.
Why?
Because I... if I have kids,
I don't want kids to be in this environment.
- What?
- Like around here.
I mean, I want my kids to have better than what I had.
You're already thinking about your kids?
No, I'm just saying.
I wanna go to school.
After a short time,
Michelle Rhee had made clear progress.
Test scores were up across the city, and her broad powers allowed her to shift resources away from the Central Office and into her schools.
For the first time in Washington, D.C. public schools, we've ensured that every single school has an art teacher, a music teacher, a PE teacher, a librarian and a nurse.
But when she tried more fundamental changes, the kind she saw in successful charter schools, the more she ran up against the system.
She couldn't extend the school day, effectively evaluate her teacherst or alter the terms of tenure.
So in the summer of 2008,
Rhee proposed a radical change in the way the D.C. school district and the union had done business for almost a century.
How soon do you think you'll have a contract with the teachers?
- We're going to...
- Within weeks? A couple of weeks?
We're going to present our final offer in the next couple of weeks.
We are gonna change the face of public education in this country.
Instead of demanding the end of tenure,
Rhee made a proposal that would give teachers a choice.
Keep tenure and get a modest raise, or give up tenure and earn potentially twice as much in merit pay.
Everyone says teachers don't get paid enough.
We're gonna pay teachers six-figure salaries.
Everybody has a choice in the matter.
It seemed that Rhee had come up with a magic formula to solve the most intractable problem in all of education.
If she succeeded, it could open the way for even broader reforms.
Educators were watching closely, and, not surprisingly, so was the National Teachers' Union.
What we're against is proposals that divide people, and that undermine education.
The mentality is that they have a right to that job.
I believe that that mindset has to be completely flipped on its head, and unless you can show that you're bringing positive results for kids, then you cannot have the privilege of teaching in our schools and teaching our children.
We ultimately wanna have the most highly effective and highly compensated educator force in the country.
We wanna make sure that we recognize and reward our effective teachers, and I think that this proposal will go a long way to doing that.
After months of highly charged debate, the local union leadership found Rhee's proposal so threatening, they would not even allow a vote.
Now I see in a lot more coherent ways why things are the way they are.
It all becomes about the adults.
We've tried money...
...passing laws...
...and the latest reforms.
I want you to get a real good idea when you start to create your figures.
But the one thing those who work in the trenches know is that you can't have a great school without great teachers.
How is it possible that all three of these rectangles have the same area?
When you see a great teacher, you are seeing a work of art.
You're seeing a master, and it is as, I think, unbelievable as seeing a great athlete
- or seeing a great musician.
- Add them all up.
What do we do to find the money?
Look past all the noise and the debate, and it's easy to see.
Nothing will change without them.
What happens when a school fails a kid?
What happens over time?
Now that we know it's possible to give every child a great education, what is our obligation to other people's children?
Sometimes, I think it's easier to think of the millions of children who are in our schools, and look at the numbers, and all of the problems, scratch our heads, throw up our hands and give up, rather than look at just one...
"...to spike..."
...and ask ourselves,
"Did we do the right thing?
Did we do enough?"
As long as she has the VGA,
I'll just hook it up.
OK. We're done.
Sixth-grade males.
In column A here,
I've assigned every student a lottery ID number.
And you have a one-preference if you live in district and a two-preference if you live out of district.
I looked at 400 random numbers compared to each other, and ran it about a hundred times, and they never matched.
Go like this. Cross your fingers.
I got a good feeling about this.
Charter law, which allows these schools, requires that if you have more applications for a grade in your school than you have spaces available, you must hold a random, public drawing...
We must conduct the lottery and it's a random selection.
You see the cages up here.
It's a random selection.
You all have your numbers, right? OK.
OK, Daisy, let's go.
The spaces with the Xs is for all of the fifth-grade students that are moving into the sixth grade for next year.
We're gonna start with the kindergartners and first and second graders, with some of the people on the wait list at the end.
Are you nervous? No? I am.
Come on, Daisy, cross your fingers.
Let's get started.

Welcome, all scholars.
We are so excited to meet you.

Twenty-two.
The remaining numbers will be on our waiting list.
Sixteen.
Thirteen.
Twenty-seven.
Three.
Thank you to all of you for being here.
Give yourselves a round of applause.
Thank you.
For families who are on the waiting list, you should receive at some time the early part of next week, confirming where you are on the waiting list.
And here we go, our final five.
Students, thank you. Parents...
We are really excited to serve your children.
And here they come, our last group.
What can I say?
Yeah. I won't give up on my kids.
OK.
Don't cry. You gonna make Mommy cry. OK?
I told Francisco,
Mommy's trying to get you into a good school, a better school.
It was much easier for me, knowing that if he didn't get in, for him not to be here,
'cause then, on my way home,
I could get my thoughts together.
There are just so many different parents out there that want so much for their children.
We know we have the tools to save those kids.
People are doing it every day, right now.
You know, the status quo can be changed, but it takes a lot of outrage and a lot of good examples, leading people to say yes, we can do this.
We can show that this is different.
The question is, do we have the fortitude that it would take as a city and as a country to make the difficult decisions that would be necessary?
If we give up, then what is the result?
What is the result?
Superman!
The children are all right, Miss Lane.
- Just a little shaken up.
- Oh, thank goodness.
- And Wagner? What about him?
- See for yourstelf.
Someone destroyed his ability to think.
I would love to say it's all fixed, and everybody says, "Oh, great, great, we believe now."
No. It is every day, you are back in the struggle, saying to these kids, "Don't give up," so kids believe again that education is a way out.
Hello. Yes, ma'am, he is. Hold on.
Hello.
- Hello. Is this Anthony?
- Yes.
Hi, Anthony. It's Mrs. Inman from the SEED Public Charter School.
How are you?
- Fine.
- You're fine?
What did you think about the lottery?
It was OK, but it could've been better if I would've got in.
I'm actually calling with some good news.
So we reconciled all of our numbers, and we were able to move students up to be enrolled, and I was so excited to see your name.
We have a space for you.
Thank you.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
- Good. How was your summer?
- Good.
Good? If I can just get you to sign in, ma'am.
- I need to sign him in?
- Yes, ma'am.
- You just sign right by his name there.
- Just give me a second.
How you doing? Mr. Bagley, your life skills counselor.
Mr. Michaels. Life skills counselor.
So how are you guys doing?
- Hi. Fine. How are you?
- In here, sir.
You're the first one, so you can choose what you want, one of the three beds.
I want this one.
No, I want that one.
- Love you.
- Me too.
"Jack lifted the lid of the great stone oven and dropped inside.
"From his hiding place he heard a mighty rumbling voice.
"Fee, fie, foe, fum.
"I smell the blood of an Englishman.
"Be he alive or be he dead.
"I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"
Whoa, pony!
Hello, love.
What have you got?
Peter called while you were out.
He left this for you.
Tour dates.
This is tomorrow...
Good evening.
The Song Remains The Same.
It's fucking true!
It comes only suddenly inside the building.
No, no, man. You know, one of those...
- Are they good?
- No, they're fucking terrible!
Those photos.
- Not again.
- They're very sexual.
I think we ought to be part of it.
When you give him a call, nobody knows.
This is a song that sometimes takes a building...
...in a manner which our forefathers were very used to.
Did you hear that?
It's right though, isn't it?
That feeling that's left everybody.
The cosmic energy!
Everybody cheers.
Jimmy Page, guitar.
Not fast enough.
This is called No Quarter.
Don't fucking talk to me. It's my bloody act. I think I'll leave you anytime.
You couldn't even give them a starting line.
Are you telling me you let...
It wouldn't happen in Europe!
I don't know how the guy got in the building.
This isn't Europe or England.
I can see that. You're so inefficient!
- Somebody got it.
- Talk to me.
I'm the manager for this group.
You had people inside this building selling posters...
...and you didn't know about it!
I didn't know about it. As soon as we found out about it, we stopped it.
As soon as we found out about it and told you, you stopped it!
All right, so you found out before I did.
How much kickback are you getting?
None. I knew nothing about it.
Come on! You don't know what the concession is?
Your mate's selling the T-shirts and making the deals.
And he told Richard about it also.
He came back, didn't he?
He does everything, doesn't he?
He does the security one night...
One night he's the guard of the fucking dressing room.
That's fucking typical, isn't it?
As long as we screw an extra few bob out of the group...
You really think I get something out of it?
You are the fucking controller!
That's like saying that anyone who jumps on the stage, I'm responsible for, too.
Of course not. You're responsible to see that the concessionaire...
You rented it. You controlled it.
Isn't selling fucking pirate posters.
You have to wait for someone else to tell you what it's doing.
It doesn't matter so long as there's an extra nickel to be drained.
By exploiting Led Zeppelin, it's great.
With the fucking Stars and Stripes behind it.
We never took a dime in concession yet.
On anything.
This is called The Song Remains The Same.
Any tickets for sale?
Any tickets for sale?
How many guys out there?
Two now.
We're in good shape. Only two.
Can we get in?
- Ask these guys. They're in charge.
- Can we get in?
If it's up to me, yeah.
Thank you!
Hey, thanks a lot!
A lot of fun!
Jimmy Page, electric guitar.
Do you expect trouble?
No comment.
That's all you're going to get.
No comment is more incriminating than a comment.
- Is it?
- Yes.
No comment.
I think this is a song of hope.

Led Zeppelin's road manager says
he put the money in the deposit box...
... and when he went back it was all gone.
The police say there was money in the box,
but they can't tell exactly how much.
The group's personal manager, Peter Grant,
discussed the theft...
... at a news conference today.
It's brought back by our attorney, physically carried...
...because that's his function...
...and when he comes back...
...it's put into a safe-deposit box.
Police said they were questioning anyone
who had access to the safe-deposit box...
... but that's all they would say.
The money is reportedly the largest amount ever taken...
...from a hotel safe-deposit box in New York City.
We asked the client, there wasn't money in the box.
Probably one of his clerks.
He noted one of the transactions.
Today was our leaving day, anyhow, so we had that amount of money...
...because we had to pay our airplanes and hotels.
After he met with newsmen,
police took Grant himself...
... and two of his employees
to the precinct for questioning.
New York, goodbye.
In October, my brother and I left Ohio.
We were driving to California.
We got into Dallas on a Thursday night.
Friday morning, while I'm eating eggs and drinking coffee, I get a good job.
I mean, it's, you know... all these people are supposedly out of work.
I'm not in town a half a day, and I've got a job.
Everything clicked.
It's as if I was meant to be here.
I'd run away from home a couple of times. Once or twice. I don't know.
And this all started,
David is running away from home.
And he takes... I took a pistol of my dad's and a shotgun.
Took a neighbor's car.
I had broken into their house and got the keys to it.
I forget exactly what it was.
Ended up coming to Dallas.
I went to work and no one showed up.
Being a weekend, sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn't.
On the way home, I ran out of gas.
And as I was walking down the street with the gas can... a person, at that time, pulled over.
I guess since I had the gas can... he figured I was out of gas.
I wasn't 100 yards from the car.
And being Thanksgiving weekend, there was no gas stations open.
He stopped and asked me if I needed any help.
I'm driving down some street somewhere in Dallas.
I had just turned 16.
And there was a guy over there,
I think he'd run out of gas...
I took him to get some gas.
This was Randall Adams.
Ended up following him where him and his brother were staying.
Eventually, that evening... we went out and got some beer.
We smoked a little marijuana and what have you.
Went to a movie that night.
I get up, I go to work on Saturday.
Why did I meet this kid? I don't know.
Why did I run out of gas at that time?
I don't know. But it happened.
The day they picked me up, December 21.
They took me upstairs.
What floor, I don't know.
But they put me in a little room.
Gus Rose walked in.
He had a confession there he wanted me to sign.
He said that I would sign.
He didn't give a damn what I said.
I would sign this piece of paper.
I told him I couldn't.
"I don't know what the hell you people expect of me.
"But there's no way I can sign that."
He left. He came back in 10 minutes.
And threw a pistol on the table.
Asked me to look at it.
Which I did. I looked.
He asked me to pick it up.
I told him no, I wouldn't do that.
He threatened me.
Again, I told him no.
He pulled his service revolver on me.
We looked at each other for...
To me, it seemed hours.
I do not like looking down the barrel of a pistol.
I do not like being threatened.
When he finally saw that he would either have to kill me... or forget the signature...
I guess he forgot the signature, because he put his pistol up.
He took the pistol on the table, put it up and stormed out.
I had a casual, friendly conversation with him to start with... to try to size him up... to see what he liked and what he didn't like.
I found almost immediately that he didn't have much conscience.
Anything he had done, it never really bothered him.
He had done other things that he told me about... that didn't seem to bother him in the least.
He showed no expression whatsoever.
It's just like he's sitting here talking about the color of this wall... or the shooting of the police officer.
He showed no reaction to any of the questions.
He almost overacted his innocence.
He protested he hadn't done anything.
Couldn't imagine why we were bringing him in.
He didn't fight or he didn't resist.
He just protested his innocence.
I told them what happened that
Saturday, that I had met this kid.
I kept telling them the same thing.
They didn't want to believe me.
Never once was I allowed a phone call.
Never once was an attorney there.
I don't know how long this had been.
I had smoked two packs of cigarettes and had been out for a long time.
Wood didn't take his ticket book out of the car.
He left it in the car on the front seat... which indicates that he was not going to write a ticket.
What he was probably going to do was have them turn on the headlights.
He didn't know that the car was stolen.
I think that there's a very good chance... that he was going to check the driver's license... and tell him to turn on his headlights, and let the guy be on his way.
Officer Wood's wife had purchased him... a bulletproof vest and had it under the Christmas tree.
Or had it stored away, to give to him at Christmastime.
His partner was one of the first female police officers... that was assigned to patrol.
They were from the Northwest Station.
Just patrol officers following the clock.
Working the graveyard shift and everything.
They had been into a fast-food restaurant. And she had a malt.
This car came by, these two dudes in it, with no lights on.
It wasn't a serious problem...
but he just pulled up, turned his lights on to stop him.
Just to warn the man that his lights were off.
Got out of the car and walked up.
Before he got to the window, where the driver was... he was in the right position.
This man just turned around and just... with a little small-caliber pistol.
The first shot hit him in the arm.
He had his flashlight. It hit the flashlight and went into his arm.
The next one hit him right in the chest.
The officer falls in the street and he was in the first traffic lane.
He lay there and bled to death.
So she's out of the car.
She empties her pistol at the fleeing suspect...
and she runs to his aid.
Procedure says you grab the radio and call for an ambulance.
Common sense would tell you that.
But what do you do?
And that time, she's so... just tore down.
And the blood.
An enormous amount of blood.
How do we hold her responsible for not following procedure?
But the main thing was, she couldn't remember the license number.
When we started putting facts together on how much information we had... from the leads we had, we found out we didn't have anything.
The only thing that we knew we were looking for was a blue Vega.
Probably every Vega that was registered in the state of Texas...
was stopped and checked.
We had people calling the office... saying, "I've got a Vega and it's not blue.
"But would you come out and be sure to check it.
"Be sure it's not mine, because
I don't want to get stopped anymore.
"I'm afraid."
If you're the investigator assigned to the murder... you get frustrated with other witnesses.
But when you got a police officer that witnessed it... you expect that they would know a little more than she knew.
Procedure.
When there's a two-person unit, when either one approaches the car...
the other positions himself to the right rear...
where they can watch all the activity in the car.
And if the man on the left of the driver gets in trouble...
their partner is in a position to help.
Speculation was, at the time... that his partner was sitting in the car.
That's where the discrepancies were.
Just a matter of time, and whether or not she was out of the car...
completely out of the car, or partially in the car...
or just sitting in there with the door closed.
And the thing I think we did then that really helped...
It didn't really help anything at all.
Let me back up.
But it was interesting, and it cost a lot of money... but it was worthwhile.
You got to cover every trail.
A guy out of California...
I don't recall his name, he was an expert in hypnosis.
He came down, hypnotized her and questioned her.
What was interesting was... she couldn't remember anything particularly about the car.
She remembered getting a malt.
They'd stopped in the fast-food.
It was a Whataburger.
They remembered all that, and stopping the car.
Got back on the road.
She didn't remember anything.
But she remembered a license number off a hit-and-run vehicle... that they had worked earlier in the night.
It was getting awfully close to Christmas.
We'd never gone that long in Dallas without clearing a murder of an officer.
We'd had several killed, but we'd cleared them pretty quick.
And this case had gone a month, or nearly a month... and we still hadn't cleared it.
We finally got the break that cleared it.
It came out of Vidor, Texas.
Mr. Calvin Cunningham, who lives in Vidor, had his home broken into... and his little Mercury Comet stolen.
We felt as though
David had committed that crime.
For several days, though, he was missing. We couldn't find him.
It was one afternoon, one of our officers spotted Cunningham's car... on North Main Street, here in Vidor.
David abandoned the vehicle and ran on foot.
We started getting little bits of information, though... that David had been involved in a shooting in Dallas of a police officer.
We would always get third-hand rumor, fourth-hand rumor.
So we went back to a few of his other comrades in crime, we could call them.
They said,
"We thought he was just bragging.
"We didn't really take him seriously."
Sitting down, watching the evening news, well, the night news.
My father was asleep on the couch.
Heard somebody knocking at the door.
It was David Harris.
I let him in. He came in.
He was standing there beside my chair... and a news broadcast advertised about a police officer shot in Dallas.
Right then and there he starts swearing up and down.
He says, "I swear to God,
I shot that fucking pig."
He says, "I'm the one that killed him."
Somewhere around Dallas, they got pulled over.
I think he said because they were checking out a stolen car.
He said that the cop had pulled him over... and walked up to the window.
When the cop came, he rolled down the window... and just pulled the gun up and shot him.
He swore up and down.
He made a big scene about it.
Jumped up and down... trying to get anybody and everybody... to listen to him.
"Yeah, I shot that son of a gun."
And everybody said,
"Sure you did, David. Sure."
"I swear to God I killed that cop."
I asked him if he'd been to Dallas.
He denied having been to Dallas.
I asked him if he'd been involved in any shooting... or knew anything about a shooting, and he denied that to the end.
Which is fairly consistent with David.
Even if he had some involvement... his first way that he always treats you, he would deny.
Then, if he felt as though you really knew he had done it... then he would be truthful with you.
He give me a pistol, a .22 caliber pistol.
He showed it to me. He says,
"That's the one I shot him with."
He gave me the pistol.
I didn't really consider it that much.
I don't guess I really realized he did shoot the cop.
He led me to a swampy area... several hundred yards behind his residence in Rose City.
There was a sock under water.
He said, "There it is."
And he had sprayed this sock with boot oil.
When we retrieved the gun...
I said, "I better do something with it.
It's going to rust up."
Even the time that I saw the gun at the trial in Dallas... it looked just as good as when I'd taken it out of the swamp.
So he had taken pretty good care of it, even though he did put it under water.
He got to thinking...
"I didn't do that and I've been saying that I did...
"and I'm in over my head now,
I better tell them what happened.
"Because they are going to send me to the penitentiary for life...
"if I don't tell them what really happened."
So he said,
"I am just bragging about this.
"I didn't do it, but I was there, and I know who did do it."
And, of course, he came clean then.
He tried to hide no facts.
He just seemed like a friendly kid.
I may have talked to him
15 or 20 minutes on a friendly basis... just to keep him friendly.
We didn't want to make him mad.
But we didn't want him to tell us something that he thought.
We wanted him to tell us what we knew.
It wasn't very long until I realized that what he knew... was the facts of the case, and it matched with what we knew.
And it had to be right.
The story that I told was...
It was like 12:00 something.
So it was the next day... early in the morning. We were stopped.
When we were stopped, the officer came up to the car... and asked to see the driver's license, and he just started shooting.
I don't know why, but it's always seemed like time just stopped.
It didn't seem like any time passed.
It just seemed like it was, boom!
Time stopped or something.
I don't know what it is.
It's like a flash.
We went back to his room.
He was supposed to ask his brother if I could stay there that night.
But he said that his brother don't like to do that.
Anyhow, he went in and never came back out. So I left.
Ended up pulling into a parking lot.
I slept there I think, for a while.
Then, finally, the next morning, early or something...
I found my way to Freeway 45.
And went back home.
After riding around with him,
I come to find out he's got an arsenal.
He's got pistols. He's got rifles.
He's got this pistol.
He's waving it around. He's doing this.
I told him, "Hey, why don't you put those in the trunk of the car?"
We stopped at a restaurant... and ordered and ate sandwiches in the car.
I bought a six-pack of beer.
He pulled this pistol back out.
And I ask him why he got the pistol out.
And he kind of laughed... rolled the window down, and fired the pistol outside the car.
And I asked him to please put it up.
And I think he handed me the pistol, and I put it under the driver's seat.
He wanted to go to the movies, so we went to the movies.
We got there probably at about 7:00.
He was the one that had picked the movie out.
I call them drive-in movies, beer-drinking movies.
$0.50, put them together and make a bunch of money...
with a bunch of people getting drunk at the drive-in.
- Are you going to concede?
- Please, sit down...
What is this, Mr. Brooks?
- Anybody can see it's an ashtray.
- Wrong!
Anybody can plainly see it's a wall-breaker!
I'm trying to speak for you!
I'm trying to speak for all of you!
I am the student body!
The show that was on was half over.
We watched half of the one show...
we started watching the first part of the second show.
We want a victory, and we're gonna get it.
I didn't really care for the second feature...
which is an R-rated, cheerleader-type thing.
I don't know what it was.
May I have some wine?
It's good, Ross.
I didn't know you could cook.
It is good, isn't it?
You got to try my celery rémoulade.
No.
I told him I wanted to leave.
"I don't really care to sit here and watch this. Let's go."
He's acting strange, he wanted to watch the end. Anyway, we left.
We drove back towards Dallas and we drove to the motel.
There's a little store.
I bought a pack of cigarettes...
and a newspaper.
And when I left, this kid was still sitting there.
I leaned against the car and we talked to him for a few minutes... and I told him that since he was looking for a job... and there hadn't been anybody at work... that if he wanted to stop back
Monday morning... that sure, he could ride out and follow me to work... and he could talk to the boss.
And he would probably get a job.
I told him that I would catch him
Monday morning if he showed up.
I told him what time I went to work.
Why, I left.
I walked around the store and went to the house.
When I walked in, the television was on and my brother was sleeping.
He had been home this whole time that I had been gone.
So I made me a sandwich...
and sat there and watched the end of
The Carol Burnett Show.
When it went off, the news came on and I watched 15 minutes of it.
And that was it.
I turned the TV off and went to sleep.
Finally, they bring in a stenographer.
She sits down and I run the story.
I tell them what happened this Saturday.
She leaves. She types.
She comes back in about 25 to 30 minutes...
with a copy of this statement.
I read through it...
and when it was basically what I liked...
yes, I signed it.
He admits driving the car and taking a right on Inwood Road... off of Interstate 35... or Highway 183.
He admits driving it.
After he made his right turn on Inwood Road...
this is where our statement ends.
He says he does not remember anything after that.
He didn't remember anything about a shooting.
He didn't remember anything about a police officer stopping him.
That part of his mind just conveniently went blank.
He remembered driving the car... and he remembered approaching the scene of the shooting... and then, from that point, he blacks out... and can't remember until he gets to the motel room... which is some 10 minutes later.
Everything else he remembers vividly.
And that's just a convenient memory lapse, is all that is.
The Morning News in Dallas County... stated that I had signed a confession... that I had confessed to the killing of Robert Wood... and they had their killer and they were ready to go with it.
The statement that I signed for Dallas County... was never... and never would have been anything as "a confession."
But yet, they labeled it as such.
Of course, I couldn't dispute this because I didn't even know about it.
I heard no news.
I knew nothing for two weeks.
They kept me completely away from everybody.
Several times we talked to her, trying to get her to recall.
"Do you recall the license number?
Do you recall anything to help us?"
And she gave us a pretty good description of the car.
As it turned out, her description of the car was real close.
It comes out that we weren't looking for a blue Vega.
We were looking for a Comet.
No telling the man-hours we literally wasted... looking for a blue Vega.
There is a difference between a Vega and a Mercury Comet.
So in reality, in regard to cars... every piece of information that was called in... they were calling in regard to a Comet,
I mean, a Vega.
The people that called in were truthful, trying to help.
They really were trying to help.
We just all had the wrong information.
There wasn't a mark on this car
David Harris had stolen.
Wasn't a mark.
Do you think a car sitting still... starting from a stop, heading up a hill... with a woman standing right behind it...
that is a very good shot with a pistol...
She should have hit the damn thing one time. She didn't.
I wish to God she had blown whoever was driving the car's head off... because I wouldn't have been here.
I went back several times... and with Mr. Cunningham, he and I both searched... and could find no indications that that car had been hit by gunfire.
Later on, he finally found one place... that he felt as though that a bullet had been creased on it.
But before he could tell me about it, his daughter totaled the car out.
Totally demolished it.
I was doing burglaries and some robberies... and a few possession cases and stuff like that.
I think he just came up to me and said:
"Are you Edith James?
I'd like to talk about my case."
That's the way I remember it, anyhow.
And I said, "Sure."
And I said, "What sort of a case is it?"
He said, "It's a capital murder." And I said...
Inside, I kind of thought:
"I've never done one, but I can surely talk to him about it."
I hate to be considered... some kind of dummy that believes in the innocence of her clients.
A lot of people think,
"A woman lawyer...
"she's bound to stupidly believe anything she's told."
I admit, I'm sort of a gullible person.
But on the other hand,
I've seen an awful lot of people... who admitted guilt or were found guilty... and all but Randall turned out to be guilty, in my opinion.
Douglas Mulder had a perfect win record.
I believe he resigned from the
D.A. 's office without any defeats.
That's why he's legendary.
Everything, as I recall, that Mulder ever said... was about what a great guy Mulder was...
and how marvelous it was that he was getting all these convictions.
I wanted somebody else in on it, so I got Dennis interested in it... because Dennis has a lot more trial experience... and Dennis wins practically all of his jury cases.
And Dennis was very enthusiastic about the Randall Adams case... because he kept saying,
"This is one we can win.
"They don't have substantial evidence.
All they've got is David Harris."
I prepared a motion for a continuance to get more time to try the case... and in doing that had to lay out my schedule for several weeks... as to exactly what time
I'd be in Vidor, Texas.
Vidor is the headquarters of the
Ku Klux Klan for the state of Texas.
It's a city where black people will not spend the night.
Black people won't even stop there to get their car filled with gasoline.
And furthermore, the people of Vidor were under the impression...
that the policeman that was murdered was a black man.
I had to stop at a motel on the way.
My wife and I stayed in one room, the lady lawyer in another room.
We arranged to get up very early, go to Vidor and start our investigation.
At about 6:00 in the morning...
Edith James, the lady lawyer, got up... and was looking for me.
While she went out in the parking lot to find me, she went to one room... and someone in the parking lot said:
"If you're looking for the lawyer from Dallas...
"he's in room..."
And he gave her the room number.
I immediately began to suspect... from the time I was that close to Vidor,
I was being followed and observed.
Doug Mulder had been there the week before I had...
and had told the people in Vidor that I was... an Eastern-educated civil liberties attorney... and that I was down there to discredit David Harris.
And then I had been recommended to see one particular policeman... who had been led to the solution of this case.
And I had the impression... that he was the one honest policeman
I could trust in Vidor.
He told me that after the policeman was killed...
David Harris went back to Vidor.
But before he was arrested, he committed a robbery down there... and had someone on the floor of a 7-Eleven type of store... with a shotgun at her throat.
Got back there... robbed O'Bannion's 7-Eleven with a.22 rifle.
Committed some other burglaries and what have you.
All this time I was on probation.
Juvenile probation.
Eventually I turned myself in for this stuff in Vidor.
I think I made a confession.
I can't even remember exactly.
So I'm told I did.
He had told us he had robbed stores, and we laughed.
"Sure, we know you have."
I'd given him one of my hats.
It's an old Bonnie-and-Clyde-looking hat, it's turned sideways.
We said, "We'll draw you a little mustache, walk in with that gun.
"Nobody'll know who you are."
About 2:00 that morning,
I was asleep and the phone rings.
I said, "Hello?" He said, "This is
David." "This is David Harris?"
"Yeah," he said, "I did it.
Will you come and get me?"
I said, "I'm not coming to get you.
I'm asleep."
He didn't have a conscience.
If I do something bad, it kind of gets to me.
I feel, "Shucks, I shouldn't have done that. I feel bad about it."
But it didn't bother him.
Didn't bother him at all.
We asked the D.A. In Vidor, Texas... what they were going to do with little David. They said:
"We'll send him to the Texas Youth Council."
And we sort of tried to inquire... didn't he think it was strange that there was a robbery committed... with that same pistol.
And here it was David Harris' pistol...
David Harris' automobile that picked up Randall Adams.
Didn't he think it was a little odd... that all the utensils for committing this so-called murder... were furnished by David Harris who got off scot-free... and was being a witness for the prosecution?
And all he said was, "We don't feel that way in Vidor, Texas.
"Our people just are not that...
"We're not that keen on ruining a young man's life."
I tried to introduce the crime spree theory.
The theory that David Harris was on this series of crimes... both before and after the killing of the policeman.
That he would be the person who had... the heart filled with malice most apt to commit a murder.
But the judge would not allow me to introduce any of those crimes.
They'd had a 28-year-old man.
The only alternative would be prosecuting a 16-year-old... that could not be given the death penalty under Texas law... where our 28-year-old man could.
That's always been the predominant motive, in my opinion... for having a death penalty case against Randall Adams.
Not that they had him so dead to rights.
But just that he was a convenient age.
The judge is supposed to have said...
That Don Metcalfe is supposed to have said... to Jeanette White,
Dennis White's wife...
"What do you care? He's only a drifter."
I grew up in a family... where I was taught a great respect for law enforcement.
I became acutely aware of the dangers... that police officers go through, law enforcement officials go through... that I think much of the public is not really sensitive to.
My father was an FBI man.
Probably at the worst possible time to be in the FBI.
It was from 1932 to 1935 in Chicago.
He was at the Biograph Theater the night that Dillinger was killed.
It was a hot summer evening.
Little air conditioning in Chicago...
and people were out for a walk.
My father would tell me that when Dillinger was killed...
within a matter of two minutes...
people were dipping their handkerchiefs in the blood... to get souvenirs.
And he vividly remembered one lady... who, all she had was a newspaper, held it up and said:
"I bet I'm the only lady from Kansas
City with John Dillinger's blood."
He told me, the "Woman in Red"... she had on an orange dress.
This is trivia, okay?
It looked red under the lights.
He said it was really orange.
So she got to be known as the
"Lady in Red" that fingered Dillinger.
He said, "It was really the Lady in Orange."
As her reward, she got a new fur coat... and a one-way ticket back to her native Romania.
His whole story from the start was two hours late.
I met this kid at around 10:00 in the morning.
He says we met at noon.
I say we were at the Bronco Bowl at 2:00 or 3:00.
He says it was 5:00 or 6:00.
Everything that we did coincide with, he was two hours late.
Two hours later.
Two hours into the night.
His testimony is that...
as we were getting off the freeway on Inwood Avenue... he stated that I'm driving the car... that we're pulled over.
He gets scared and he slumps down in the seat of the car.
That, as the officer walks up...
and shines his flashlight, and I roll down my window...
I pull the pistol out and blow this man away.
His testimony is... when I finally do drive to the motel...
I get out. I tell him,
"Don't worry about it.
"Forget this ever happened."
That's crazy.
The police officer was killed at 12:30... which is about two and a half hours after he last saw me.
Just before he went into the motel... he'd gone across the motel courtyard... to a little store over there and bought some cigarettes.
And I was supposed to go and find out if the man remembered him... coming in there just before 10:00 to buy the cigarettes.
I didn't get over there to Fort Worth for a long time.
We got some pictures from his family that didn't show him in jail clothes.
I took the pictures in to show them to the man behind the counter.
He was very cooperative and he wanted to help us.
But he honestly... He said:
"I don't remember anything about this guy coming in there...
"I couldn't tell one night from another.
Might have been that night or another.
"Cause they were always coming for cigarettes."
His brother... at first... was saying that at the time of the murder, that he was home... watching... I believe it was a wrestling match on TV.
And he said, "Me and my brother likes wrestling matches. He was with me.
"Randall, my brother, was with me all night long.
"He couldn't have done it."
He was trying to cover for his brother.
Later, as I recall, he changed... because he said:
"If I get down there and perjure myself...
"there's nothing that they can do because they've got the case."
This is the way I think that he thought.
"They know that my brother did it.
"If I get up there and lie, they are going to have me for perjury.
"I'll be in the penitentiary with him, and it ain't going to do any good...
"so I just ain't going to testify.
I ain't gonna say nothing."
So he backed off of his story completely... and Adams was left without any witnesses.
Her in-court testimony and her original statement... which should be the best.
You're talking 15 to 20 minutes after the killing.
Should be the best eyewitness testimony she's got.
It doesn't match. Doesn't match at all.
In court, she testified... he got out of the car, she got out of the car.
She positioned herself at the back of the automobile.
Her original statement,
15 minutes after the killing...
"a fur-lined collar on the killer."
In court,
"It might have been bushy hair."
The kid testified that I had a Levi jacket on... which is the same type collar, basically the same as this.
He testified at pretrial that he had a fur-lined parka.
She's telling you who killed the man.
One person in the car with the fur-lined collar.
Very convenient that the driver happened to have bushy hair.
All she's got to do is look at a picture they took of me.
But that is not her original statement.
It's a hell of a big difference from "fur-lined collar" to "bushy hair."
It's crazy.
She went through two weeks Internal Affairs... when she comes out, her testimony changes.
She goes in saying one thing, she comes out saying another.
Something happened. What?
"We refreshed her memory."
Friday afternoon,
I think it was Good Friday... we came back in the courtroom that afternoon...
and we were sort of elated because we thought...
"He's gonna walk."
And there's nothing really in that evidence.
There's just little David Harris, and nobody believes him.
And so we were very optimistic about his chances... until we walked into the courtroom... and here were all these people standing in front of the bench.
Three of them, anyway.
They were taking the oath to be sworn as witnesses.
Mrs. Miller got on the stand that last afternoon.
And she said,
"That's the man, I saw that man!
"I saw Randall Adams' face just right after..."
She said, "I saw the gun sticking out of the car...
"when he shot that police officer.
And that's the man."
And she waved her finger right toward Randall Adams.
She's the one that got him convicted.
When I was a kid,
I used to want to be a detective... because I used to watch all the detective shows on TV.
When I was a kid they used to show these movies with Boston Blackie...
and he always had a woman with him.
I wanted to be a wife of a detective or be a detective... so I always watched detective stories.
I'm always looking because
I never know what might come up.
Or how I could help.
I like to help in situations like that.
I really do.
It's always happening to me, everywhere I go... lots of times there's killings or anything.
Even around my house. Wherever.
I'm always looking or getting involved, to find out who did it, what's going on.
I listen to people.
And I'm always trying to decide who's lying, or who killed who... before the police do.
See if I can beat them.
Yeah.
I was working at a gas station.
My husband and I both.
We weren't getting along well at all.
We were arguing back and forth.
We didn't wanna go home, because we'd rather talk it out in the car... than go home with the kids and fight.
Had to listen to them, too.
So we were really arguing, and decided to get something to eat.
About that time, a police came out of a restaurant... on the right hand side of the road...
and he went to pull the man over.
She turned around.
She was looking hard. She looked.
I didn't think she seen the guy, but she did.
Because I said, "What you looking at?"
I knew something had went wrong.
She said, "You just shut up and drive."
And I kept telling my husband:
"Slow down so I can see."
He said, "Come on, we're getting out of here.
"You're too nosy.
You don't even know what's going on."
I had no idea that somebody was gonna get killed or shot.
So I just drove on.
He was one of these kind that didn't like getting involved.
He wanted to go on. He told me to shut up and turn around. Don't look.
I turned around and looked anyway.
So we heard something, like backfire or firecrackers.
And so we drove over the bridge, and I got to thinking.
I said: "Em, there're no firecrackers this time of the year."
I was thinking to myself:
"That couldn't be somebody shooting."
It was real dark, and it was cold.
It was hard to see in that car.
But his window was down.
The driver's window was down.
This is how I got such a good look.
I really couldn't see anything inside.
It was kind of... shadows on the window and stuff.
But when he rolled down the window, what made his face stand out so.
The car was dark blue.
He had a beard, mustache... kind of dishwater-blond hair.
But, like I said, when he was in court, he sure looked a lot different.
All I could just tell by this and this, that it was him.
I knew that there was some shots over there.
But I didn't want to be involved in it... because West Dallas is a high-crime neighborhood.
One of the biggest.
He was more scared of it than I was.
But when you have black people like that... they don't like getting involved in nothing.
That's just common.
Like here, nobody wants to see nothing or hear nothing.
And they'll stay completely in the background.
That's why they were having such a hard time there... finding anybody that would come forward.
Because it was in a totally black neighborhood.
She believe in, see somebody done something wrong she should tell it.
'Cause she told on me... a couple of times... that I was hauling drugs out of El Paso.
Called the sheriff down there, going to make me open my trunk.
So I ended up opening it, but there was nothing in it.
Good grief.
She's a ho, but she find out you done something, she turn you in.
Mrs. Miller had testified at the trial... that she had gotten off early from her gas station job... and gone down to pick up her husband to help him with the bookwork.
We found out that she was not doing any bookkeeping for that station... because she had been fired from her job two weeks earlier... for till-tapping, for stealing.
The reason that they were talking to the police at all... was that there'd been a three-day running knife fight in their apartment.
And they were all booked... for disorderly and drunk behavior in there... including assault with knives, and all kinds of stuff.
When they were at the police station, they suddenly decided to volunteer... all this information about what they had seen...
about the police officer's killing.
A woman called me at my home... and said that she knew this woman... who had testified and identified
Randall Adams from a passing vehicle.
This woman had never told the truth in her life.
She also told me that she had tried to call the D.A. During the trial... and give this evidence that this woman was not believable.
If their case hinged on this testimony, this was not believable testimony.
They were scum. They were just... actually scum.
He was a black man and she was a white woman.
He came to work the day after.
He told me about the policeman that had gotten shot the night before.
And I hadn't heard anything about it.
And I thought it was another one of these stories.
And he brings in these newspapers... and he says he didn't see a thing.
He couldn't see nothing, it was dark.
Wheels started rolling in his head about money.
That's when he got the idea.
Let me put it in his words.
For enough money, he would testify... to what they wanted him to say.
He would say anything they wanted him to say.
Or he would see anything that they wanted him to see.
Those were his words.
I was shocked that he did go ahead... and get up and tell that he saw the actual shooting... and recognized the boy. Identified him.
That's when I called Dennis White.
I told him, "That man's lying."
Nobody has that good of an eyesight.
From where the policeman was shot and from where they were at...
I doubt if you could have even seen them with binoculars.
I'm a salesman.
And you develop something like total recall.
I don't forget places, things... or streets.
Because it's a habit, something I just picked up.
I just stare intensely at people and try to figure them out.
Being nosy, I just stare.
I was leaving the Plush Pub one night... driving a 1977 Cadillac...
heading west on Hampton.
I noticed an officer had two individuals pulled over... to the curb in a blue...
some type of vehicle.
It was a blue...
It was a blue Ford.
It was a blue something.
The driver, I think, had long blond hair and a moustache.
And the other one didn't have no hairs on his face.
A person that is white going through that area at night... he's a sore thumb, he stick out for the first reason.
And if they don't look right, they're gonna stop you.
The officer, he walked up to the vehicle.
His car was behind...
I don't know if it was behind or in front... but I know he had him pulled over, and he was up to the car.
I think he was up to the car.
Let me think.
Yeah, he was up to the car.
As we was coming by he had to have been up to the car.
I didn't see no bullet.
I didn't see no gunfire.
Because I went on.
We have three people that testified and identified him... positively as being the driver at the time that Wood was walking... right beside the car.
So we know that he was the driver from the witnesses... and we also know... that it was the driver that shot Officer Wood... coming from his partner.
We couldn't have made a case...
with the voluntary statement that we got from Adams.
We had to rely on witnesses.
And this is what we did.
I always tried very hard, every judge I know of does... to not show emotion on the bench.
The reason, if you do show emotion... the jury might take it that you're favoring one side or another.
So you try to remain passive, emotionless, objective.
I do have to admit that in the Adams case... and I've never really said this...
Doug Mulder's final argument was one I'd never heard before.
About the "thin blue line" of police... that separated the public from anarchy.
I have to concede that there my eyes kind of welled up... when I heard that.
It did get to me emotionally, but I don't think I showed it.
In death penalty cases... we have a question, or we did at the time... of whether or not that person is of a dangerous mentality... and might be expected to commit other crimes.
To answer that question...
the Dallas District Attorney sends psychiatrists to the defendant's cell... to discover whether he is without remorse... and therefore is a dangerous and psychopathic personality.
Of course, in the instance of a person... who did not commit the crime, they're not going to show remorse.
There were two psychiatrists that appeared again and again.
Holbrook and Grigson, the "Killer Shrinks."
There was certain criticism directed against these two people... because, in effect, whenever they showed up, the purpose of their visit... was to kill the defendant.
It was April 15th, tax day.
I think I was filling out my taxes at the time.
Afraid I might be late.
A guard walks up to the door... tells me, "There's someone out here who wants to talk to you."
I ask him who it was.
He said he didn't know... but the court ordered me to talk to him. I said, "All right."
And here come this real tall, ostrich-looking dude.
He introduced himself as Dr. Grigson.
He pulled a pad out of his coat pocket... that had a line drawn across it.
On this pad, on the upper half... he had six images.
I will say a box, a square, a circle with a diamond in it.
I don't... It's been awhile.
He slides this piece of paper across to me and he hands me a pencil.
He says,
"I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
"Please copy what's on this piece of paper."
I'm looking at this man.
I said, "What? You want it copied just the same way you did?
"Or you want me to change them around? What do you want me to do?"
He said, "Just do whatever you think you want to do."
And he left.
So on the bottom half of this piece of paper...
I made my boxes and X's... and zeros with diamonds in it.
Exactly like his.
He asked me...
"What's the meaning of
'A rolling stone gathers no moss?"'
I'm looking at this man.
I said, "Are you kidding? Is this a joke? What are you doing?"
He said, "No, I really want to know your answer to that question."
I said, well,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss."
I said, "To me...
"it would represent that a person that doesn't stand still long enough...
"it's kind of hard for people to cling to him.
"If he keeps moving around, it's hard to get close to him."
He shook his head.
He said, "What about 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"'?
I said, "If you have a hold of something, why give it up...
"for a chance of getting something that might be a little better?
"It doesn't make sense. You've got something good, why let go of it?
"If you can get the other one, get it if you can...
"but don't let go of what you got to try to get something else."
He asked about my family.
He asked about my background.
And he left.
Total time we had talked, maybe 15, 20 minutes.
Dr. Grigson was up there testifying he would commit violent crimes... in the future if he was released.
Grigson is known as "Dr. Death" because he always testifies that way.
In about 99% of the trials...
that he's been a witness for the prosecution, he always testifies...
that they will commit violent crimes in the future.
You can't tell what somebody's gonna do years from now.
Not really.
Except based on your past record, which anybody can do.
Randall never had any prior record.
And as far as we know, he never had any history of violence whatever.
Grigson testified for... two and a half hours about all these degrees he's got.
He's been here, and he's been there, and he's studied here.
He called me Charlie Manson.
He called me Adolf Hitler.
He said I'm the type of personality... that can work all day and creep all night.
He testified, Grigson... that the future seriousness... of my mental state... would be such that if they released me...
I would go crazy and probably butcher half of Dallas County.
Even though he talked to me
15 minutes...
I have no prior convictions, no prior arrests...
I was nonviolent for 28 years.
On one instance... and that's saying if I did this, which I didn't...
he's stating that, that's enough...
For the rest of my life, watch me.
Don't ever turn your back on me.
And he talked to me 15 minutes.
He's crazy.
You can understand why a man might steal if he needs money... to put food on the table.
I can understand why a 17-year-old boy who doesn't have a car... would steal one to ride around in.
I can understand why the heroin addict needs heroin.
But it's very hard to understand why anybody has to kill a police officer.
It just doesn't have to be.
When I'm asleep and I close my eyes and think...
"Why would he do it?
"He had no background that would lead to murder...
"no reason to commit a murder."
And I look at the facts of the case and say...
David Harris knew the car was stolen, knew the guns were there... knew the guns were stolen... was on a crime spree... had had a criminal record prior to stealing this car and these guns.
He was the one that wanted to commit the murder... and get away from the scene.
He was the one that, after the murder was committed... went right back home and bragged about it to his friends.
I looked at all the evidence... and I found that I believed that David Harris committed murder.
The jury looked at the same evidence... and found they believed that
Randall Adams committed murder.
And it was their verdict that counted.
You have a D. A... he doesn't talk about... when they convict you or how they convict you... he's talking about how he's going to kill you.
He don't give a damn if you're innocent.
He don't give a damn if you're guilty.
He's talking about killing you.
You get numb. You get...
It's like a bad dream. You want to wake up, but you can't do it.
Fifteen times, 20 times a day,
I hear this same story... about what happens when a man is electrocuted.
His eyeballs pop out.
His fingernails pop out.
His toenails pop out.
He bleeds out of every orifice he's got.
They don't care...
They don't care.
All they want to do is talk about how they're going to kill you.
That's the only thing that they cared about and talked about.
At that point, that's all they're wanting.
I didn't have any idea what happened to him.
After I testified, I was gone.
I never really concerned myself with it.
Maybe I didn't want to know.
I don't know.
I didn't have any interest in knowing... otherwise I might have tried to find out.
Dennis filed the motion for a new trial...
then we filed an amended motion for a new trial.
About 20 days later, we were to have a hearing on it.
Both Robert Miller and his wife testified there.
But we could not bring out the fact... that they had said that they were gonna get that reward money... and that they didn't care whether they saw anything or not... but their car was too steamed up.
We were not allowed to get any of that in... because it was held that it was impeaching testimony... and therefore it came too late.
We kept running into blank walls.
A reporter from the Dallas Morning News... discovered that one week after the trial was over with... the daughter of this woman had a robbery case in this court.
She offered her testimony...
at a time when her daughter was in danger of going to jail for life...
and got her daughter out of jail.
How can you believe her... when the very next week the same judge dismisses that case?
The Millers are the kind of people that would do anything... if there was something to be gained... such as her daughter not being sent to the penitentiary for armed robbery... or for money.
When we went to court that day, the District Attorney was hard-nosed.
Wouldn't let me answer any questions.
He'd ask me questions, but then he'd cut me off real short.
And that's when he said something about my big fat nose.
If I'd kept my big fat nose out of their business... the Millers would be better off.
When I started to leave out of the courtroom... he started laughing, like:
"Didn't do you any good to get up here."
It really didn't.
Didn't help the guy at all.
To the best of my recollection... the brief conversations
I have had with Mr. Adams... and they have been brief...
I don't even recall ever asking him, or my having told me... that he did not do it.
Because, for my purposes, representing him on appeal...
it's totally irrelevant.
When the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas... voted 9-0 against us,
I was a little upset about that.
I felt we, A: Should have won...
B: Certainly shouldn't have been slapped so hard... with the unanimous decision against us.
I was with my family in an ice-cream parlor... and the judge and his family happened to come at the same time.
And he came over to me and made the comment...
"I see where the Court of Criminal
Appeals gave me an 'A'...
"in the Adams case."
Our highest state appellate court... the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin affirmed the case, 9-0.
Then it was reversed by the
United States Supreme Court, 8-1...
When the Appellate Court reverses a case... they are never saying the trial judge was right or wrong.
They are saying they disagree with the judge.
You can't, for instance, in the Adams appeals... say the appellate courts were saying I was right or I was wrong.
After all, if in Austin... in our state appeals court,
I was 9-0 correct... and in Washington, I was 1-8 incorrect.
If you tally all those votes,
I come out 10-8.
Yet the case was reversed.
Eight justices of the Supreme Court were the first people to agree with me.
They're the only people anywhere that ever agreed about that statute...
were eight justices of the Supreme Court.
The Dallas Morning News had a very nice front-page story... either the same day... or the day after the reversal was announced by the Supreme Court... in which Henry Wade, the District Attorney...
vowed a retrial of Randall Dale Adams...
because there was no room in his book for a cop-killer...
getting off with anything less than the death penalty.
I took that to heart. I thought
I was going to get my chance.
For reasons that were never really made public...
Mr. Wade requested the governor to commute...
Mr. Adams' death penalty to life... and that eliminated the possibility of a retrial... based on the reversal.
I was absolutely shocked.
I can't help but believe... that some of the motivation behind that decision... was a fear that...
Adams may be vindicated at a retrial.
I just felt they prosecuted the wrong person. I don't know why.
I felt that some policeman, whether in Vidor or in Dallas... made a decision to prosecute and set the wheels of justice in motion... in the wrong direction and they got going so fast no one could stop them.
So I felt it was up to me to stop them and I didn't.
I felt it was up to the Supreme Court and they did what they could, but... it's all gotten messed up and derailed again.
Since his trial, I have given up my practice of criminal law.
I have not had a jury trial... since I heard the verdict of this jury in this case... and don't intend to.
I just feel like...
I'll let other people handle these problems for a while.
Because if justice can miscarry so badly...
I'd rather do something else.
Prosecutors in Dallas have said for years...
"Any prosecutor can convict a guilty man.
"It takes a great prosecutor to convict an innocent man."
To this day, I think Mr. Mulder... believes that the Adams conviction was one of his great victories... probably because of some reservations he has about Adams' guilt.
I got a call one morning, a lady here in Vidor... had been hit over the head with a rolling pin... and the attacker thought she'd been knocked unconscious... when, in reality, she wasn't.
And she recognized the attacker to be David Harris.
He voluntarily came to the police station.
I told him,
"David, this girl knows who you are.
"I don't even have to tell you
I know the truth.
"You know I know the truth this time."
He said, "I was wrong.
I smoked marijuana, I was drinking.
"I don't know what got over me but something just came over me."
But he forgot to mention one thing, that he was only wearing underwear.
I felt as though the attack was sexually oriented.
He never wanted to admit that... and, as I recall, he never really finally admitted it.
He'd just get to where he wouldn't deny it.
He posted his bond and went to Germany.
We had a crime with basically the same M.O. As his... and so it led me to want to check and see if he was in town.
I contacted the Worldwide Military Locator... to see if, through the military,
I could locate him.
I did, and found out that he was in prison at the time.
He really didn't remember what happened.
He said he woke up in the stockade...
and he'd been told that he beat up one of his ranking officers.
We had another occasion to have a crime that fit his M.O. A lot... so I started looking for him again, and this time...
I found him in prison in California.
So I realized again that unfortunately, he hadn't straightened up.
He was still having a lot of problems.
I was 16 years old.
I really didn't have no real dealings with the court systems, etc.
Didn't know how they worked, really.
Didn't know much about the law.
Just a young, dumb kid.
Police give you the time of this and the time this happened... and you just correlate from those events.
You just estimate from that event what time it was.
You don't know.
You're taking a guess.
Police tell you, "It was 12:30 when this crime happened.
"What time did you leave the movie?"
"I know it was somewhere around midnight.
"It might have been before then.
I don't know.
"I didn't have a watch on."
He went over my testimony with me pretty extensively.
How I should answer certain questions... things of this nature.
That's what you call
"coaching the witness."
Let's get this evidence in a spectrum where it's going to be most effective.
At the time,
I didn't really ponder on it... but he was deceiving the jury.
He wanted to deceive justice.
That's why I think that statue with the scales...
Justice? What is she called?
I don't know what she's called.
She's got that blindfold on.
We don't see what goes on behind the closed doors.
I had another woman in the car.
I didn't tell them about that.
My wife'd kill me.
She would've tore my head off if she knew I was out with another woman.
Would you tell?
That's what happened.
I was trying to get her home.
The driver's side was down because... the lady was a little sick.
She needed some air.
Because she was pretty drunk.
See, the Millers, one is black and one is white.
They said I was going with...
The reason I was over that night...
I was over there messing with this man's wife.
And I ain't never gone with her in my life. She was too old and ugly.
Like I said, the D.A. Will put something into their mouth.
They could have prefabricated the whole story.
They sure could have.
But what I saw is just what I saw.
That was it.
So if they got paid, they got paid for lying.
They already decided what to do with you in the hall.
That's why they call it the Hall of
Justice, the scales are not balanced.
The scales are in the hall, and they go up and down.
They might go up for you, favor one way, they might go down against you.
So if the D.A. Wants you to hang
15 or 20 years, you're hung.
I had all these charges still pending in Orange County.
I could have been certified as an adult... maybe given a life sentence.
I don't know.
I'm 16 years old.
I know I don't want that.
That District Attorney told me,
"Don't worry about them charges."
"I'm gonna ask your...
Defense Attorney is gonna ask you...
"if you had any kind of deal...
"or anything of that nature...
"in exchange for your testimony in this case...
"as relating to those charges.
"Don't answer that 'Yes.'
Answer it 'No."'
My husband, he didn't get that good a look at him.
He wasn't sure, because they put a bunch of them that looked alike.
They had about three or four in the lineup that had bushy hair... but he had his combed down, different to what it was in the killing.
I didn't pick him out right then... because I picked out this bushy-haired man.
I understand one other witness did pick out the man at the lineup.
I'm not sure, but I think he did.
Of course I picked out
Randall Adams just like that.
I don't know about the others.
Evidently they did at that time.
I just took off.
It's like, kids run away... they don't think about where they're going to stay... how they're going to eat, all these things.
They had that roof over their head all their lives.
They don't really think about those things... till you get out there and you say,
"My stomach's growling now."
Or, "It's getting cold out here.
It's raining."
There was ice on the road.
I remember there was a car coming pretty fast up the road behind me... and didn't see me or something... or was in one lane and came into the other lane and I was in that lane... and tried to stop me.
He went off the side of the road.
I remember this car went off the side of the road.
I'm just looking back.
I remember that.
I got a call at my house about 3:30 one morning.
One of the patrolmen in my department called... and said, "We just arrested this boy named David Harris...
"and he won't even tell us his name.
He said he wants to talk to you."
They told me something that really made me interested. He'd been shot.
David had initially told me that he had gone to a bar in Houston... and was flirting with a young lady and her boyfriend became upset... and chased him out with a pistol, shooting at him.
We knew that wasn't true.
I said,
"David, I know you're lying to me.
"We go through this all the time, all my dealings with you in the past.
"I don't know what you've done just yet.
"I know you were shot.
"I know you were shot doing something that you shouldn't have been...
"we know you burglarized a gun shop.
We know you were driving drunk.
"Got witnesses who can identify you, who can identify your truck."
I said, "You're caught.
So tell the truth."
And David said, "Okay, I killed him."
Their home was entered while he and his girlfriend were there alone.
The man was sent into the bathroom at gunpoint and told to stay there.
David took the girl and was starting to leave.
The man exited the apartment with a gun.
The man fell to the ground, or near the ground... holding onto a pole there in the parking lot of the apartment complex... and these last, whether it be two, three, or how many shots...
I don't know, were fired at point-blank or near point-blank range.
David thought that the one that was really at fault that night... was the guy that got killed.
He said, "That guy's crazy.
"He came after me with a gun."
I told him,
"David, you'd broken into his house...
"you abducted his girlfriend, what was he supposed to do?"
He said,
"Man shouldn't come out with a gun.
"That dude's crazy.
He should have been killed."
When we went to retrieve the pistol...
I had to go into the water to get it.
It was a bayou and it was grassy, snaky-looking area.
I was not real pleased about being there myself... but David enjoyed watching me have to go down there and look for the gun.
I'd been searching several minutes, he was up on the bridge... and probably 25 feet from me... directing me to where he thought that the gun had landed in the water.
He was handcuffed.
Traffic would come by, and he would turn around... and show them his handcuffs and holler at them, "Help me!
"The officials will throw me in this water and drown me."
Just anything he could do to make a joke and cut up out there.
He was just really having a good time.
The kid scares me.
To think that he could actually be out there, walking the streets... and Dallas County let him go.
The kid had seven crimes coming down on him.
He had armed robberies.
He had firing on a peace officer.
He had breaking and enterings, aggravated assaults.
God knows what all this kid had.
And Dallas County gives him complete immunity for his testimony.
Just lets him walk.
My mom had a good phrase.
She said the first night she pulled into Dallas, it was raining... and that it was lightning.
And they're coming into Dallas... and she said if there was ever a hell on earth, it's Dallas County.
She's right.
You deal with people who you sense bad vibrations, more or less.
You feel, this guy doesn't like me anyway because I'm a policeman.
You can just kind of sense something.
Maybe I shouldn't even be saying it... because police shouldn't take these things to the bank.
When you deal with people over and over, you sense a lot of things.
Talking to David, you don't ever feel hostile feelings coming from him.
I have never seen David any way... other than cordial, friendly to me as he could be:
"Yes, sir." "No, sir."
Never disrespectful.
I've never seen the bad side.
I've seen the results... and I've talked to him about it, and he's aware of it.
He remembers the bad side.
But I've never seen him committing a crime... or in a violent or volatile state.
When his crimes were confessed to... he seemed to feel better and do better during those times.
His parents would tell me he would to do better at home... he seemed to get along better with the people in town... his neighbors and friends.
But something happens to David...
I don't know what it is. I don't know if anybody can put their finger on it.
But there's no other indication of anything in the family...
that would lead you to believe he had exposure to these activities.
David's got at least one other brother and sister that I know of.
And he had one brother that drowned numerous years ago.
I was 3 years old...
I had a 4-year-old brother... and he drowned in 1963...
right after President Kennedy was assassinated, I believe.
Sometime right after that, during the summer.
We was living in Beaumont on Harrison Street...
and my dad was working on his truck out in the yard...
and mom was in the house doing her housework or fixing dinner.
Me and my brother, we had one of these little blow-up pools...
and we were playing in that.
My dad was supposed to be watching or keeping an eye on us or something.
My brother wandered off down the street...
and these people had a swimming pool in their backyard...
and they were elderly people.
They never used the pool.
I guess it had a bunch of leaves and stuff in it.
And he, evidently, fell in there and drowned.
I used to sit up in my room at night and talk to him and he wasn't there.
So that might have been some kind of a traumatic experience for me.
I guess my dad...
I don't know, maybe he couldn't get rid of the responsibility... or the guilt or something.
I don't know what it was.
I was there and I guess maybe
I reminded him of that... all the time, growing up.
It was hard for me to get any acceptance from him.
When my younger brother was born...
it was kind of like he was Daddy's favorite or something, I don't know.
Everybody's life is going to take some kind of path regardless of what happens.
I think maybe that a lot of the things
I did when I was younger... was an attempt to get back at him or something... for the way he treated me.
But I wasn't doing nothing but hurting myself.
"Dream..."
"...when you're feeling blue"
"Dream..."
"...that's the thing to do"
"Things never are as bad as they seem"
"So... Dream"
"Dream, dream..."
On April 8, 2000,
Mark Hogancamp was in a bar.
He left the bar about closing time.
And a group of 5 individuals had been in the bar harassing him,
...then they went outside, followed him, and beat him senseless.
Stomped on him, and did some pretty bad damage to his brain.
The doctors had to rebuild his face.
The impact on the brain from the assault...
...was such that he was in a coma for 9 days.
To see your 38-year-old son having to learn how to eat again,
...taking his first steps.
I mean, seeing your 38-year-old son starting to walk again.
And seeing it, it's heart breaking.
He was there for 40 days in the hospital.
And then they dismissed him because he couldn't pay for it...
...when he was on Medicaid.
I took care of Mark for 2 years...
...after he got out of the hospital.
I mean, he really literally had to learn everything over.
He went to therapy for a very short time.
It was... all these physical therapies he went through...
...and talking and word search and all this stuff.
He was just starting to get, you know, some of this stuff back...
...when they just, like, cut if off.
"That's it.
That's all you get."
Then you come home from work...
...and he's building this little miniature building,
...and looks like hell, just made from old plywood...
...and nasty stuff and pieces of stuff you find around the yard.
But it's developed into a world, his own world.
This is me.
After the attack, of course.
Always smoking.
Um, I used to carry one revolver.
And then general Patton gave me his other revolver.
So now I have two.
Because the general just wants to hang out, have a drink.
What's this all about, man?
When the teenagers kicked my head to pieces,
...they wiped, I mean, everything.
All memory of everything.
My memories that I do get, they come back in stills,
...just a single shot, but no context.
Alls I have is a photo to remind me that, OK, I was married, wow.
To a good-looking girl, too.
She was a Russian polish.
Anastasia.
I started to ask questions...
...because I didn't know who I was.
I had to ask other people.
What was I like?
Was I bad guy?
Was I mean? Was I?
And they would tell me,
"No, you weren't mean."
"You were just drunk."
You know, you were an all right guy.
"Did I hurt anyone?"
"No, you just hurt yourself."
Then I started finding my drunk journals...
...and started reading those...
...because I wanted to find out who I was.
For real.
'Cause the only one that would know...
...is the guy who was writing them, who was me.
Maybe not in the right frame of mind,
...but it was me.
It's all messed up like this because I was hammered.
"I'm gonna die tonight."
And, oh, January 19, 1993.
"Last entry."
And I was like, my god.
It was like reading something...
...that Stephen King wrote or something.
It was bad.
I never want to see this guy again.
I figured, all right, well, what's the first thing I got to work on?
That's my imagination.
I came flying over in my
P-40 Warhawk. On fire.
And I saw a field down below.
And I crash landed it.
And when I walked into town,
...there was nobody there.
And then one by one, beautiful barbie-looking women...
...started emerging.
I was the only man in town with 27 barbies.
The S.S., I found out later,
...went through there and killed men.
It was like a desolate town.
And they all hid when the S.S. were there.
So they came out and they thanked me.
I was thinking, "Boy, what a lucky guy I am."
So they gave me my own place, my own building,
...which I turned into a bar.
I used to work there
5 days a week.
You know, 10 hours a day.
But now I just work once a week,
...and it's 4 or 5 hours a week,
...just so I can get used to doing things again.
Mark's job is... he kind of does anything I ask him, really.
Doesn't come in too much...
...because it's too much for him...
...if he's around a lot of people and a lot of stress.
He came to me, he was in recovery.
Didn't last long.
And he was awful.
He drank.
Sometimes he came to work,
...sometimes, like he said, he would have a shot...
...just to steady himself for the day...
...and just call in and say, I'm not coming.
After he got out of the hospital,
...it was like somebody turned a switch.
He had no interest in alcohol at all. At all.
After the attack, when I started coming around back here,
...I looked at the bottles and I don't get that same feeling.
Nothing happens when
I look at the bottle.
It's like liquor, booze, that's it.
I mean, if I don't remember what it's like to be drunk...
...or what it tastes like, then I don't miss it.
I just figured I'd be like Sam
Malone, you know, from "Cheers."
You know, he's a recovering alcoholic...
...and he is a bartender.
I made my alter ego figure drink only coffee...
...because that's what
I do in real life,
...drink tons of coffee.
Does anybody ever try and offer your alter ego a beer?
Yeah. Yeah.
And what happens?
I just tell them
I don't drink.
The only entertainment I could think of was cat fighting.
So I paid the girls to cat fight.
Staged cat fights for entertainment purposes only.
I named my club, besides Hogancamp's,
...I added a little bit more.
Hogancamp's ruined stocking.
Cat fight club.
The only one in Belgium.
This place. Just looking at it soothes me.
I used to be able to draw anything that came to my mind,
...but now, since the attack, I can't
...because my hand shakes too much.
This one was evidence.
Still has the evidence sticker.
His drawings were there to show to the jury...
...what this individual was capable of doing.
Brain damage you can't see with your own eyes,
...but you can see the manifestations...
...from what people have been able to do before...
...to what they can do now.
Mom, I'm home.
I need supplies.
When Mark first came in after the attack,
...he was very upset.
His hand wasn't steady enough to do anything.
And he was afraid that he wasn't gonna be able to continue,
...and that just frustrated the heck out of him.
So we encouraged him.
And Janet, when he didn't have any money,
...she'd give him a kit or something to work with.
He kept bringing things in to show us.
And you could see the excitement in him,
...like, "Yeah, yeah, it's there.
I hope to get better at it."
I'm in the Hobby Shop.
I just love the Hobby Shop.
You get too...
You get too excited.
Everything's real.
The slide on the .45.
The hammer.
The clip even comes out.
So that adds to my, you know, verbosity...
...of getting into it, into the story,
...because I know everything works.
I almost know what everything...
What every Satchel's carrying.
You know, that's grenades.
This is the briefcase
I carry around.
In here we have money,
...the detonator,
...and then certificate of ownership...
...that I made up myself for my doll figure to carry around...
...because this proves
I own the bar, then.
This is my mom, my mother.
This is from the movie
"Goldfinger," 007.
Pussy Galore was her name.
Anyway, yeah, it looks just like my mom.
When my mother came to visit,
...I said, "mom, mom, look, there's you.
You're tending bar."
Then she... "Yeah, OK."
Didn't even look.
Just walked right past it.
So it's like... but it's my mom, you know.
So I gotta have my mom in here...
...in my town.
This is how I work on patience.
This is how I work on dexterity.
Training my right hand to be a little bit calmer,
...not shake so much.
I'm amazed how I can talk about this...
...and actually do it at the same time.
That's a first.
I started needing vehicles for my town.
And the tires, they looked so brand new.
They got the little factory seam around every one.
It looks like it just rolled out a show room.
I don't want that.
So I start dragging stuff.
The jeep has
180 miles on it.
Which is 1,080 miles in 1/6 scale.
When I'm even walking,
...I have to constantly look at my feet.
I can't look around like other people do and just walk...
...because otherwise I'll wind up in the middle of the road...
...or something like that.
So I've always got to look at what's ahead.
I'm walking along.
I'm walking on that white line.
I always have to keep on looking down,
...make sure I'm walking on that.
And I still lose my balance and stuff when I'm doing that,
...but I'm getting better at it.
Americans and Germans were wandering into the town...
...either because they were lost...
...or they just came across the town.
There was one rule in my town.
That... friends.
Be friendly with each other.
Behave.
So they did. They were.
The Americans, the British, the Germans,
...they all drink together, they all smoke cigarettes together.
Everybody be friends with each other.
The Germans, when they were there,
...I told them they have to get along with the Americans.
And as long as I gave them booze and a couple of cat fights,
...staged cat fights, between the girls, they were happy.
So the Americans and Germans sat together, drinking together.
Everybody got along.
Nobody was against anybody else.
It didn't matter what clothing they wore.
When I get that new character and I open up that box,
...the first thing I look at is their face.
And then I think, who does that remind me of that I know,
...that I want to portray with an alter ego in my town.
And then that's their alter ego.
She looks like Pam.
A girl I know, Pam.
That's married.
Down at the anchorage.
So I think I'm gonna make her Pam.
Pam.
Then sometimes I just do a quick thing like this.
Like, oh-ho ho.
Like they're hugging me.
Like they bought me and stuff.
I know what it's like to build things in miniature...
...and want to have, like, a society outside of society,
...a smaller society.
When Mark creates a character for you,
...that's really a way
Mark honors you.
And I felt very honored...
...when Mark made me part of his town.
My doll, I believe he's a British commando.
I think it's a handsome doll, myself.
There's always something going on at Marwencol.
There's always danger. There's always the S.S. trying to attack.
I've taken place in many battles,
...and we usually come out on top.
Everybody at one time or another...
...wishes they had a double that could do things...
...that they could never do.
So what I do is with alter egos,
...I tell my friends, you can be anybody you want,
...you can do anything you want in my town.
Have as many girls as you want.
I only... I have 27 barbies,
...so we have to keep enough for the other dudes.
Mediterranean Lisa said,
...I want to have a tall, dark, and handsome boyfriend.
I said, OK.
So I put her with Yazi the Navajo Indian.
And she said, he's gorgeous.
He's perfect.
But she didn't know
I had a Steve McQueen doll.
When she found that out, she wanted to drop the Navajo like a hot cake.
And now Steve McQueen’s her boyfriend.
I am Mediterranean Lisa, and this is my doll.
I am now dating
Steve McQueen.
I'm very happy about that.
A couple buddies of mine...
...were looking at my town one day...
...and it was all, you know, the soldiers out there and stuff.
And I had a barbie.
And one of them said, "hey, look, man, it's a barbie."
And I says, "Yeah, what do you want it to be, gay town,"
"...with all dudes in it?"
He's like, "No."
I said, "Man, all the dudes got to have some women."
You know what I mean. I...
I love the thought of women.
You know, so I want women in my town.
This is the last girlfriend that I had.
9 years ago.
It's the last time I ever felt a woman, hugged a woman.
Kissed a woman.
The first 4 years of that 9 years...
...was because I was a drunk and I didn't care to look for women.
I'd just rather drink.
And the last 5 years,
I've been me being busy,
...trying to get back my senses,
...fine motor skills.
I have to learn that all over again, sex.
Because I don't know...
...I don't remember what it was like.
That's what I used to do to my wife...
...when I would come off the ship.
Come home and attack her.
She'd be waiting.
I wish I had somebody to come over, a girl preferably,
...to manipulate the female dolls.
That'd be neat...
Playing dolls with a girlfriend.
My bedroom window was right across the street from a big house...
...with a white picket fence...
...and a big tall blonde lived over there.
We would... you know, if I was outside and she was outside,
...we'd, you know, meet at the picket fence.
And the other neighbor,
Betty, would come over.
And then the three of us...
...would be at the white picket fence.
So I dubbed it the gossip fence.
It was great.
She was just so beautiful.
Hi, I'm Colleen,
...and this is my home.
And this is where Mark and I used to talk...
...and gossip by my fence.
I like blondes to begin with, so.
'Cause of my ex-wife.
She's blonde.
You know, so I experienced the feeling of a crush.
What it is to want someone.
I have 3 children.
I'm married.
I didn't know about that. Can't have her.
You know, I just...
Oh, innocent me.
I didn't understand it.
I mean, I didn't want to steal her away.
I just wanted to let her know...
...that she was on some scrumptious.
Mark had shared with me, like, certain pictures...
...that he had been taking, photographs,
...and telling me certain story lines that he had had.
And I just kept telling him to go with it.
My husband was just like, you know, you got to be aware.
Just be aware.
She matches.
I mean, her shirt matches her little sparkles.
And that's what Mark was probably thinking, too.
I was like, yep, that's me.
A barbie doll.
This is the Colleen doll.
I did her hair last night.
Um, when I wash it and all that crap.
Get all the chemicals out.
I put more chemicals in by spraying it...
...and combing it and stuff.
But this is how it dries...
Close to her head,
...not sticking out way out here like it was yesterday.
And Colleen has this nice little one piece of hair...
...that always, you know...
A strand that always hangs down and stuff.
Hey. She looks hot.
Anyway, I'm putting Manolo
Blahnik slingbacks on Colleen...
...'cause she deserves that.
So we were just talking...
...and he goes, "what would you name a store?"
There would used to be a store, and I used to love this store,
...but it actually went out of business.
And it was pocket full of posies.
So I built it.
So I preserved Colleen,
...and I can have her in my town.
"I'm making believe"
"That you're in my arms"
"Though I know you're so far away"
"Making believe
I'm talking to you"
"Wish you could hear what I say"
"And here in the gloom of my lonely room"
"We're dancing like we used to do"
"Making believe is just another way of dreaming"
"So till my dreams come true"
"I'll whisper good night"
"Turn out the light and kiss my pillow"
"Making believe it's you"
OK.
Mark had gotten into a conversation with me...
...and he was showing me some certain pictures.
I says, look, look,
...I even put your name on the car door,
...my name on that car door.
You're here, I'm here.
And he was like, well, they're getting married on such and such day.
I said, what, you know, we're engaged.
As he was telling me,
...it was like he was telling me about it like it was somebody else,
...like it was two other people.
And then when he told me it was us,
...and I was just like...
What?
Hello. You're talking to a real person, and there's dolls.
You have to know when you have to stop.
So I go outside sulking and stuff.
And there's Deja Thorus, the
Belgian witch of Marwencol.
And I explained to her what went on with Colleen.
And just then, here comes Colleen...
...waving, "How you doing,
Mark?" And everything.
And poof her out of her shoes,
...get rid of her forever out of Marwencol.
Just get rid of her for me.
So I didn't complain.
So who's that?
Anna. That's Anna, my favorite female doll.
I wish that she would come alive.
I won a photo contest...
...and with that money,
I bought Anna.
Sorry.
When I first got the doll, I fell in love with her face.
So much that I had to paint makeup on her.
And being that
I'm alone in life,
...I figure at least my alter ego...
...can have a girlfriend.
Every night she's next to my bed, I stare at her...
...and I wish and I wish and I wish...
...that I could find a girl that looks just like her.
When I first saw Mark,
...probably a year before I actually talked to him,
...he's in this full
World War II regalia...
...and it looked like he had a remote controlled truck or something,
...like one of these
RC aficionados.
My window actually looks out the curve,
...like right past us going toward his house.
And so, I noticed every day around 2:00 or 3:00...
...he would start coming home.
So I set my long lens...
...and tried to zoom in to figure out what was going on,
...if this was a remote control...
...or is this grown man actually pulling a car...
...or a truck or something.
And then I decided that I was going to try to figure out a way...
...to stop and talk to him.
I saw him again when he was walking down the street.
I drive way up ahead, I park maybe 75, 80 yards up ahead,
...and get out.
I'm sitting there and can sense him...
...getting a little closer and closer.
I go, "Hey!" You know,
"How's it going?"
He's like, "Pretty good.
Pretty good."
And he stops and proceeded to introduce me...
...to the people in the jeep.
There were 2 figures in the jeep.
He says, this is actually so and so,
...who is someone
I work with.
And this other woman, she's actually an old neighbor of mine.
I was like, has anybody else seen this stuff...
...or talked to you, you know?
He goes, you're the first person to ever really stop...
...and say, that's interesting.
What are you doing?
Or where are you going?
Or what's that all about?
The next day, this envelope stuffed with photos.
And I opened them up, and
I was just astonished...
...by the realism and the feeling.
When I went to his house after I saw the photos,
...I said, now, do you have anymore of these?
He goes, oh, I've got thousands of them.
Yeah, sure.
'Cause I'm a photographer, I was,
...how do you manage all your assets and your negatives?
He said, I don't even keep the negatives.
The negatives,
I throw them away.
I asked him about metering, things like that.
He said, you know, well, the light meter's actually broken.
So basically what I do, is I set up these shots...
...and shoot them, then send them off to a mail order lab,
...which is where he got all his processing done.
And wait a couple weeks, he'd come back,
...they'd be overexposed
2 or 3 stops or under,
...and he's just shoot the entire thing over again.
It's funny. I don't think he ever even thought of himself...
...as being a photographer.
He was just using a camera as a tool to communicate.
Definitely didn't identify himself as an artist.
It was all such a genuine thing.
And I just... I felt like it was too amazing...
...to not share with other people.
The story, meanwhile, was just going on in my head,
...like, OK, the S.S. heard about my town, my bar.
They're just driving around aimlessly looking for Marwencol.
Looking for the town they heard of,
...the bar they heard of, the women they heard of.
That the Marwencol women were beautiful.
They're the most beautiful girls in Belgium.
So, eventually, the S.S. find Marwencol.
And there's nobody around.
We all decided to go to the bar,
...Hogancamp's cat fight club,
2 miles away...
...and hide in there.
And the only one left in town was Ruth.
She had decided to stay behind,
...watch over the church.
And the S.S. came in.
And they interrogated
Ruthie.
And these guys wanted to know where the bar was.
"Where's the bar?
I want a drink."
'Cause I remember that's the way
I was when I was an alcoholic.
"Gah! I want a drink!"
You know. I remember that.
And so, she still wouldn't tell...
...the S.S. where my bar was, where I'd moved the bar.
So they killed her.
I heard that
I'm killed off.
Yes.
I don't remember you ever telling me.
You were in the church...
...when the S.S. came and found Marwencol.
They wanted to drink.
They wanted to party. You know.
There was nobody there but you.
You wouldn't tell them where the bar was,
...so they killed you.
The bad guy killed you.
And then they started walking out of the church.
And the professor, who stayed behind to watch over Ruthie,
...he was picking off the S.S..
He got three of them.
So the S.S. scared back into the church.
They were gonna stay there until they found my bar.
And the professor was just... every time one of them would poke their head out,
...he was picking them off.
And that was good.
If Mark is angry, he definitely takes it out on his town,
...which I guess is a good outlet, you know.
Instead of taking out in real life,
...he takes it out on his town.
And he gets a lot of anger out that way.
And the S.S. takes the brunt of a lot of it.
I think a lot of it stems from his attack, too.
He's got a lot of anger to let go,
...especially for groups, people who hate.
And it definitely shows in his town.
Anything pisses him off in life,
...that's an outlet for
Mark to take it out...
...and someone in that town's gonna get it.
I created my own therapies.
And this was one of them.
Wow.
I could act out my revenge and anger and rage...
...in photographs.
It's nice to be able to...
You know, somebody hurts you,
...you can, without any violence,
...you know, get back at them.
You know.
Correct. Right.
Whether it be on paper or in film.
Yep. Yep.
I still really miss somebody to talk to...
...about still the way I feel.
So you're not in therapy now?
Oh, no. No.
This guy is Tod, the editor for "esopus" magazine.
Good friend of mine named David Naugle,
...he was at a party and said... had his Mac with him,
...and he said, I've got to show you something.
And I thought it was fantastic.
Just like nothing
I'd ever seen before.
And the story, although I didn't know much of it at that point,
...was fascinating to me, too.
The magazine is...
The whole purpose of it is...
...to present a space that's completely uncommercial,
...completely unmediated, and completely unfiltered...
...for artists to present their work to,
...hopefully, a fairly broad general public.
To find somebody like Mark who's doing this amazing work...
...that no one has seen ever,
...except maybe a few people he worked with at the anchorage and David,
...was just like a gift from the gods, you know.
Does it feel like therapy at all to you,
...or is it all just art?
It constantly keeps my mind...
It keeps my mind constantly working.
Uh-huh.
I mean, the minute I met him,
...I was like, oh, he's like a nice guy.
He's just a wonderful nice guy.
He's so much further along than most of us would be in that situation.
And really because of what he'd decided to do with his life.
This idea of someone using art to sort of access something they lost...
...or to sort of regain something they lost...
...was just so beautiful and so moving to me.
And then the work was so great.
It would be a great story if his work were, you know, nice,
...but his work is strong.
It's strong stuff.
So that just made it such a no-brainer.
Of course we're gonna do this.
Meanwhile, back in Marwencol...
The town Germans and I came up with a plan...
...that I would pretend to be the town Germans' prisoner.
They would bring me to the church.
And that way we could infiltrate the S.S.,
...and then just get our town back.
Yeah, but that didn't happen...
...because the S.S. took me,
...sent the town Germans out of the church.
They tied me up, the S.S. tied me up.
Then started interrogating me.
Where's my bar?
Where did I move the bar?
We want to drink!
That's what they kept on,
...with anger and stuff like that.
Then started cutting me.
And on my alter ego,
...I put a scar down the right side of my face,
...because this is the side...
...that was damaged in real life on me.
There's one major difference
I found immediately...
...between Mark's work and a lot of other contemporary art...
...that I look at and see and life, for that matter.
That is, particularly when you're using dolls...
...or some kind of... you're re-photographing something,
...there's generally a very strong sense of irony in the work.
There's a distance.
And it's kind of a little wink-winky.
Like, I'm photographing dolls.
Isn't that, you know,
...funny or subversive or clever or whatever.
And I just... the thing that struck me immediately about Mark's work...
...is that there's no irony in it as far as I can tell.
I mean, he's a very clever guy, very smart,
...but he's in the work.
He's not using the work as a tool to do something else.
The work is him.
It's a very authentic feeling to me,
...which is a wonderful thing.
You don't see it that often.
So then, back at my bar,
...all the dolls in my bar heard...
...that the S.S. had me tied up and they were cutting me to ribbons...
...and beating me up.
So Anna didn't want to wait around for another brilliant plan...
...that the townspeople had come up with.
So she took Chris and Jacqueline...
...and traded their uniforms for barbie clothes.
They went into town with their hands behind their back.
Each hand was carrying a pistol.
And they waltzed into town.
Anna grabbed my revolver from the town German,
...and the 3 of the girls went into the church.
Just like precision surgeons,
...they eliminated the S.S.
They only wounded the worst S.S. guy,
...because they had plans for him.
They wanted to save him for later.
And Anna came over and she cut me down...
...and held me until the jeep came...
...to pick us up and bring us back to my bar.
Her coming and saving me from the S.S.
...proved to me that she loved me.
It proved to me that she felt the same way I felt about her.
So the call went out to all the town's barbies.
"We did it before and we can do it again"
"And we will do it again"
"We've got a heck of a job to do"
"But who better to see it through?"
"We did it before and we can do it again"
"And we will do it again"
"We're one for all and we're all for one"
"We'll get to lickin' before we're done"
...then Svetlana takes a pistol while the S.S. guy's still alive,
...good old-fashioned eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth sort of thing.
And still smiling, the women of Marwencol...
...had gotten their revenge.
This is no town that you can push over and take over.
This is what happens to people who mess with us.
So this is my wife, Anna.
When'd you guys get married?
March 26.
I still remember that, too.
I don't remember when
I got married in real life.
I mean, I remember that it was 8-4, '84.
But I don't recollect that wedding...
...as much as I recollect the one that my alter ego got married to here.
And it's weird when I say
"My wife," you know.
It's like I remember saying that back when I was married,
...but it just... it doesn't hold any, you know... I don't know.
Anna's competition is Deja Thorus,
...the Belgian witch of Marwencol.
She's competing for my love.
Deja Thorus was in love with me.
She's still in love with me.
She can't get me, even though she brought me back in time...
...so I wouldn't meet Anna and all that stuff.
But I did meet Anna.
Anna and I kissed.
And while we were connected on our kiss,
...we remembered all the love we once had for each other,
...so Deja Thorus' spell was broken.
This is Deja Thorus' time machine.
And I'm proud of it.
It was an old VCR that ate one of my best porno tapes.
So I had to extract the tape somehow.
So I took an MP3 player stand and made that the seat.
And found an old cell phone keypad on the roadway...
...when I was walking.
So I glued that on this thing that I put there.
And before I knew it, there it was, the time machine.
Tod showed my stuff in the city.
And he tells me that there's a curator of an art gallery...
...that wants to display my photos.
I did feel a very strong responsibility...
...and a concern about, you know,
...will the show be too much?
What if this leads to, you know, attention...
...and it's bad for him in some way?
Will the photographs look OK?
Will the space be OK?
Will he like the space?
Will he be comfortable here?
Will he make to the city?
He hasn't been here for a long, long time.
He hasn't been out of Kingston for a long, long time.
I'm happy about the whole thing...
...except the talk of me taking something so sentimental to me...
...and having it on display
100 miles away.
It's a very big decision for me to make.
Women want to meet the artist.
They don't want to hear that the artist couldn't make it.
They want to meet the artist.
And, of course, if some big spendy guy comes in...
...and he's looking for something,
...he has tons of money, mad money,
...and he wants to meet the artist,
...he doesn't want to hear, oh, the artist couldn't make it,
...he's too afraid to come to the city.
Yeah. So, I'm still afraid to go to the city,
...but that's where courage comes in.
Courage. I was taught that courage is to face the thing,
...to do the thing,
...even though I have such great fear of doing it.
Anna comes back to town and she's all pissy...
...'cause I didn't want to go.
'Cause I have mental problems.
I'm still disturbed by the S.S. tying me up.
And to get a close-up of her looking at me...
...and then scooting on over, and now we're kissing.
So that's the whole outcome of that.
It gets stranger by the moment, doesn't it?
218 pair...
Of women's essence.
I mean, they wore these.
They scuffed them up, I can tell if they were a smoker or not.
I should be a shoe detective or something.
Yep. Some of these...
Oh, none of these are ones I've stole.
They were all given to me by women.
They were.
I'm not kidding.
Like Colleen gave me a bag full of shoes.
Colleen.
The first night we went home to his apartment...
...when he got out of the hospital,
...he sees this whole shelf of high heels.
And he says to me,
..."Do I have a girlfriend that lives here?"
And I said, "No."
And he says, "Well, what's with all the shoes?
And I said, "Well, Mark, those are your shoes.
"You buy them, you collect them.
I think you wear them."
If I tell people who I am and what I'm about,
...I'm true to myself.
That means I'm not lying to myself.
What they do with that is on them.
I'm not accountable for their feelings...
...or how they perceive it, make faces and stuff.
That's when I close in and discover who I am.
And that's all part of the finding out who I am...
...part of this new life,
...second life I was given.
This is a B.A.R.
It's a browning automatic rifle.
It's .30 caliber.
It has a mean punch.
She's got 2 .45s.
I've got 2 six shooters and one .45 shoulder holster.
When I walk the 2 miles to the store...
When I feel apprehensive...
...and I look down at the jeep and
I know that they'll protect me.
It's dolls.
There's a lot of firepower in there.
And I make sure I put the correct weapons...
...with the most firepower in there before I take my walks.
It's just in case.
People don't know
I'm disabled.
They don't know that
I don't think correctly.
They don't know that I have psychological problems...
...like I'm always on guard, always looking over my shoulder,
...always worried about being attacked again.
They just see me on the outside.
Outside, yeah, I'm trying to act like a normal human...
...so I don't get attacked again
...by the stronger ones.
I figured I'd go out and see what was going on in town.
While I'm focused in on what's going on in my town,
...this S.S.
Snuck up behind me.
And I don't hear him.
Brings me back to town...
...where all of his buddies are,
...and five of them figured they'd have a little fun with me.
And then it all comes back again...
The attack, those 5 scumbags, how bad I want to kill them.
I hope Mark is not always haunted by this experience,
...but unfortunately, this kind of thing...
...doesn't leave you just because the case is over.
I don't know if I'll start ripping them apart.
I don't know if
I'm gonna want to kill them.
And I don't know if it's gonna take like 8 police officers...
...to shoot me.
There's no fair fighting person that's been jumped on from behind...
...and every memory kicked out of his head.
There's no etiquette to fighting after that.
Sorry, I get a little angry and stuff...
...thinking about it.
After they get done kicking and punching me,
...they drag me in the church.
Figured they'd have further fun.
There's that.
Happy what he did.
He's like, "Good.
Kill that Hogancamp."
So Deja Thorus sensed that I was in danger.
So she hopped in her time machine...
...and used it just to transport herself...
...as fast as a plasma jet of a blazar,
...which travels at 99.9% the speed of light.
Like I imaged that it happened in real life.
There she is.
My savior.
And then, in like a Belgian accent girl voice,
..."Oh, my love. Why would anybody do such a thing to you?"
Since I can't remember...
...what happened in the bar, what led them to beat me up,
...I was told that I told them that I was a cross-dresser.
So that's what
I have been told happened.
So I think they...
...I believe they attacked me because I mentioned that I was a cross-dresser.
We were in the bar.
The guy said...
...he was a cross-dresser and everything.
And I started figuring out he was gonna get it.
I think Freddy wanted to beat his ass.
He was saying, "I have no problems with anybody."
"I have no problems with anybody."
That guy didn't do nothing to anybody.
I could tell he was being set-up.
Man.
When in doubt, bring them all.
Got to bring this.
I don't know if
I'll use all these,
...but I bring them anyway,
...just in case.
I'm really, really attempting to have a positive look...
Outlook on everything.
But it's that subconscious fear that I still have,
...you know, about being hurt again.
That's the biggest fear.
I don't want to get hurt...
...mentally or emotionally or physically ever again.
So that's why thank god there's that other voice in my head...
...that still didn't get broke in that attack...
...that tells that side that's so worried,
..."Hey, come on, don't think about all that stuff."
"Come on, give it a go, man."
Do the show like you do
Marwencol the story."
And since I was given a second chance at life,
...I want to live this rest of my life to the fullest.
I'm gonna do things I've always wanted to do...
...but was always afraid to do.
I'm gonna do them now.
You know, like wear pantyhose, wear a skirt,
...you know, wear heels and stuff.
It's just...
It's good feeling.
I mean, I haven't got up the gumption to walk in public.
I don't know how to be smooth.
That's my... I mean, I don't know if I want to look like James Bond...
...or if I just want to look like a hip artist.
I don't know.
But I'm representing myself down there.
And I don't want to wear anything stupid.
'Cause the first impression is a lasting impression.
You know, that's what leads me all the way back to the suit.
But really... what I'd really like to wear...
...is that long chiffon slit skirt.
But that's what
I'd like to wear...
...in my fantasy world.
These are meant for women's dolls legs, but they fit mine.
My figure, 2 or 3 times I put tights under his pants...
...just to see how that felt.
And I was like, no,
I'm still...
I don't want to come out of the closet in my town yet.
But my girls, they know me better than I know me.
You're gonna let me loose in a land of people that are like me...
...Greenwich village,
...the weirdest place on the planet,
...where I could walk in high heels and nobody would care.
Some dude would say, "Hey, nice shoes."
"Thanks, man."
You know what I mean?
"I like your shoes, too."
You know what I mean?
It's, like, people like me.
Nobody cares. They're all artists and stuff down there.
So for me, it's gonna be that's what
I envisioned, that's what I project.
I put them like this.
You know, pull the blanket over.
Then make sure that nobody's hanging off...
...and they're all tucked in.
Because if they're happy,
...it means
I'll sleep better.
I always see them.
They're the last things
I see before I close my eyes...
...and go to bed.
That's just how I say it.
Out loud so I can hear it.
That's how often
I get out from here...
...to see real women that wear make-up.
And something other than sneakers...
...and jeans or boots.
I'm nervous.
I'm super freakin' tired.
My energy level...
The batteries are low.
I couldn't sleep last night.
I'm thinking about this and making lists and stuff.
You know, and I'm making another list now this morning.
Copying makes sure,
...so writing it the second time,
...you know, it's like, all right, make sure I have everything.
I built Marwencol for me,
...for my therapy,
...and now it's like everybody's.
Like, everybody wants to...
Everybody wants to...
...play in it or be part of it and everything,
...and I don't want all that.
It's like this is the one last thing...
...that I don't ever want taken from me.
And it seems like it is,
...but theoretically it's not.
It's still mine.
It's still mine.
I expected 98% of people in Greenwich village...
...to be walking on the street in big feathers,
...and outfits, and...
I'm glad I have the ability...
...to escape into a fantasy world.
I'm real glad that
I have that ability...
...because those guys,
I thought, took it away.
I thought they took away my imagination...
...along with everything else.
And like I've been fighting to get balance...
...and everything else back, you know,
...I fought for my imagination, to get that back.
And that's when
Marwencol started.
The more I built and the more I played around,
...you know, and bought figures and stuff,
...the more the story just came alive in my head.
So...
It's gonna go there.
OK? The big one?
Every time I see
Marwencol the town,
...it brings me right back to when I started the town,
...and how close and dear it was to me,
...and how much I wanted people to know about my town...
...and to be part of my town.
That's why I started putting people that I know in it,
...is because I feel so alone here.
And if I have an alter ego...
...from people that I know in my town,
I can manipulate them, make them do whatever I...
You know, I want.
And, you know, I'll be surrounded by my friends.
Now look right dead in the camera.
What do you think about this?
That's a nice camera.
No, the artwork we have to look at today.
Oh.
There's no words.
I can't think of anything.
It's a suit-and-tie thing?
No, no.
No, no, no, no.
You can wear what you're wearing now.
See what everybody's...
Yeah, this is what
I'll be wearing.
I want you to be yourself.
You don't have to feel like you have to dress up.
That's all.
You can wear whatever you want.
Man's shoes.
They look all right.
Is my hair all right and?
Yeah, you look great, man.
I look like a beatnik artist?
There's definitely been a strong response to his work.
What I really love is for somebody to come along...
And a gallerist, or a dealer, or a curator...
And say, "This is really interesting work."
"I'd like to help him show it on a regular basis."
I think that the really ideal thing...
...would be for him to know that when he makes work from now on out,
...there are gonna be people ready and waiting to see it.
I don't know what to say.
I don't know how to speak to people.
They're big collectors, they're big, important people,
...but I have no idea how to talk with them.
Should I be writing Down?
Should I photograph them? What?
You know, so the most I could do to that big collector...
...was say, "You have nice shoes.
I like your shoes."
And she looked at me like,
"You're strange," you know?
Sorry, ladies before gents.
Yeah, go ahead.
In Europe they always offer a cigarette.
That's the one.
I have 218 pair at home.
Really?
Yeah.
Pictures or pairs of shoes?
Really? Shoes?
Oh, women's, man.
It's like, when I'm stuck where the movie's going...
The movie...
Where the story's going...
I slip on a pair of heels,
...and the characters tell me...
...where the story's going next.
Hmm.
That's Anna and I just taking a ride yesterday.
Who's Anna?
My wife.
See, the S.S. Sent somebody there to kill me,
...and all the women of Marwencol...
...stabbed the crap out of him.
And I make sure that I turn that damn flash off...
Oh, yeah.
'Cause the flash takes
50% away from the photo.
Oh, yeah.
Not one picture did I take of my show,
...or of people hanging out at my show,
...or... Just shoe shots.
I was like an elephant...
...left in charge of the peanuts.
That's good.
That's what he... that's it.
All right, so long, ladies.
I went to his show,
...and I sat there, and I was looking,
...and I was listening to people's opinions about his stuff.
And I felt myself, like, getting mad or defensive...
...about people who had negative stuff.
"Oh, let's go look at pictures of real war."
You know, like, this is Mark's real war.
My mind can't decide...
...what world to go for.
Realistic world?
But there's dangers out there.
People out there are so...
Real.
And I don't understand all that.
I feel safe when I get in my town,
...and it just takes everything away.
I prefer...
To live in my world.
I want to live here in Marwencol.
My character in the story...
...had to create something for himself...
...to deal with the trauma that he still had...
...from being attacked by 5 S.S.,
...and beaten, and kicked, almost to death.
You know, so it was a lot of wear and tear...
...on his mind and stuff, so...
You know, he found comfort...
...in building his own little world, his own little town,
...that's, you know,
...peopled with little
1/6 scale dolls and figures...
...and stuff, and each with a personality.

I was born in Berlin, Germany.
My father and mother had a fur business in Germany.
And I have a brother who was a year younger.
We lived very comfortable, had a nice life in Germany.
I remembered that huge, beautiful building... with gardens all around and a stream going through it.
I lived there with my grandmother.
I went to a Jewish school- a private school.
Had a nice girlfriend there,
Anna-Marie... whom I was very friendly with, and we spent a lot of time together.
My sister went to another school.
She was older.
I had my dolls.
My mother made clothes for my dolls.
My father was a peddler in Germany which meant basically... he would go to a place and buy textiles... cut in three-yard length.
Then he’d go into villages and sell them door-to-door.
Usually when my father would return, if it was a successful trip... he brought back toys from the various villages, and that was exciting.
We used to go to the suburbs of Breslau on picnics.
In the winter we went to Czechoslovakia... to a place called Spindleruv Mlyn... where my parents went skiing and I went sleigh riding.
Jews in Germany felt at home and felt it was their vaterland... where they could live forever, and they felt at home with German culture.
They felt proud of
Germany's achievement... and of Jewish contributions to Germany.
While on the one hand German Jews- especially when Hitler rose- started writing a spate of books called Jewish Contributions to Germany...
Jewish Contributions to Civilizations- were not aware of the fact that the
Germans looked at it quite differently.
Instead of saying, look how much we contributed to law... to journalism- created a whole new genre- to medicine and science... the Germans said,
"You took over our science.
You took over our law.
You took over the newspapers. "
In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party rose to power in Germany.
They immediately acted on their ideology of racial discrimination and violence.
I came home from school... and the Nazi party was marching on the street... and everybody's standing on the side and saluting.
Suddenly they said-
That means "Hit the Jews. " They grabbed a few people and started beating them.
They were yelling,
"We are no Jews. We are no Jews. "
They kept on beating them for the cameras that were set up.
Till one day, in the usual ice cream parlor... we couldn't go in anymore... and we were just beginning to learn how to read.
That's when the signs came up all over.
"No Jews, no dogs" in the stores.
"No Jews, no dogs" on the benches.
Couldn't quite understand what this was all about... but I remember my grandmother taking us by the hand and says, "Haroldchen. "
That's how she used to call me.
"We can't go in here anymore.
We'll get ice cream some other place. "
Yeah, this "Jews and dogs forbidden" was all over.
I had non-Jewish boys to play with... and then sometime-
I don't remember what year it was- none of my non-Jewish friends... would play with me, talk to me- just disregard me.
My next memory actually was of our doorbell ringing at midnight.
I imagine it was shortly thereafter.
My parents wondering who's ringing the doorbell at midnight.
It was my uncle, my mother's brother.
He says, "I've got my chauffeur waiting downstairs.
I'm on my way to France via Switzerland... because it's the end for the Jews in Germany.
I think you should come with us. "
He had always been a bit of an eccentric, this particular brother... so, when my father heard it, he says,
"The meshuggener Leo.
What a crazy idea he has.
This madman's not gonna last. Things like that have happened before to the Jews.
Impossible. Besides,
I fought in the First World War... and we've been German for generations.
We've lived here.
Let's wait and see. "
In July, 1938...
President Roosevelt convened the Évian Conference... to try and solve the refugee problem in Germany.
But the conference ended with no solutions.
The refugees had nowhere to go.
Every country was told at the Évian Conference... that they do not have to take more than their usual quota.
Britain won out in that Palestine was not mentioned as a haven.
Goebbels writes in his diary...
"They are shedding crocodile tears.
They want us to do their job for them... and they really don't want the Jews as much as we don't. "
So the Évian Conference showed Hitler... that the world didn't give a damn.
In 1938, a young Jewish man... enraged at the treatment of his parents by the Nazis... shot and killed a German diplomat in Paris.
The Nazis used the incident as a pretext to orchestrate violent riots against Jews.
Thousands of shops were looted and destroyed... and virtually all synagogues in Germany were burned.
Ninety-one Jews died, hundreds wounded.
The police were told not to interfere.
This night was called Kristallnacht.
"The Night of the Shattered Glass. "
When the ninth of November came along... and the Nazis wanted to get into our house... the Hausmeister, who was a big Communist before 1933-
After 1933, of course, he became a big Nazi.
He was standing in front of the building in his uniform... and saying, "There are no Jews in this building. Keep on going. "
That saved us at that time.
My father put on the radio, and all he heard was martial music.
He went out.
He wasn’t sure.
He didn't like to see what was happening.
He decided to go into hiding.
When we got out the next few days...
I saw the glass... and the burning synagogues and all that.
We walked over to my grandmother's house to see if they were all right.
I remember the crunching glass under my feet.
Even now, more than 60 years later,
I can still remember it.
The day after Kristallnacht, my parents and I walked out of our house... and the grocery store near us, which was owned by a Jewish family-
The windows were shattered and had "Dirty Jew" on it.
Then we walked to the synagogue which we attended... and as we walked by we saw in the courtyard of the synagogue... there was a mound of ashes.
It was clear that these were prayer books.
Sticking out of the center of the mound were the scrolls of the Torah.
I remember being terrified by that... because I had just learned... that if the Torah was dropped in the synagogue, even by accident... the whole congregation would have to fast for 40 days.
And here I saw the Torah is being burned.
Internally I said to myself...
"There's no safety for us anywhere. "
All of a sudden... almost all Germans sought a way out.
"Where can we go?
Where can we find a haven?
Where can we get out?"
Of course, the lines on all the embassies and consulates... were blocks long with the attempts to find a haven.
The American consulate closed their doors... and no visas were ever given out again.
You couldn't get into America.
You couldn't get to England.
You couldn't get to any of these places because we had no passports, no visas.
The quota numbers were very small.
Among non-Jewish people that lived in our house... one of the men was a very high officer in the German air force... who warned my father not to stay in Europe.
He says, "We are going to conquer all of Europe. "
My father fortunately felt the same way.
He was a peddler... and arranged with 11 other people... to pay someone to get him across the border to Belgium.
They did make it across the border... and they were picked up by the Belgian authorities... who turned them back to the Gestapo who turned them over to Dachau.
One of the ways in which the Austrian Jews were encouraged to leave... was to arrest the men... and incarcerate them... in concentration camps... and then saying, "The only way you're going to get your men back-"
To these women who were left behind, the families that were left behind.
"The only way you can get them is if you leave within a month...
24 hours, two weeks, two months," or whatever they decided.
My father decided to come out of hiding.
It seems the Christian landlord told him, "Don't. "
He went to the friend's house to pick me up.
It so happened the Gestapo was in the same house.
He got picked up, and he was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp.
I was picked up on the street... taken with all other Jews to Sachsenhausen.
We were standing there, and the command came out...
"Anybody below 14 and over 80, step forward. "
So, I was 13.
I stepped forward.
They put us on a truck, and they sent us back home.
I spent one day.
So, all of a sudden, there developed- first in Vienna- a haven that nobody dreamed of before.
There's a place you can go to without a visa, without papers.
It was extraordinary.
How could there be such a thing?
It was hard to imagine.
Where are you going?
8,000 miles away.
Shanghai... a sprawling port city on the east coast of China... was forced by the British to trade with the West... after the Opium Wars of the 1840s.
Powerful and decadent... tremendously wealthy and miserably squalid... voracious and corrupt... it became the commercial center of China.
To sustain their booming trade... the West created a section of the city where Western law ruled.
It was called the International Settlement.
Later on, the French created their own settlement called the French Concession.
The International Settlement... had grown up, since mid-19th century... outside of the walled town of Shanghai.
Shanghai was a town with walls around it... and the International Settlement grew up outside of it.
They built up those ports.
They built up all of them- not only Shanghai, but that was the biggest one- into a major world harbor... where the settlement created a tremendous boom.
There were two Jewish communities in Shanghai.
The first group came following the British during the late 19th century.
They were Baghdadi businessmen and their families.
As British subjects, they were able to take part in the booming Shanghai trade.
They were English-speaking.
They did business with the British.
They did very well by doing business with the British.
Some of them were enormously wealthy... like the Kadoorie... the Sassoon... and the Hardoon families.
The second community consisted of Russian Jews... who immigrated to China mostly to escape the Communist revolution in 1917.
Although not as affluent as the Baghdadi Jews... they also had a rich community life.
The Russian Jewish community which existed- the second one- grew up parallel but not identical... or mixed with the Sephardim.
They were separate and unequal.
In 1937.. began the war to attack the Chinese garrisons... in the outskirts of China.
From that time began the Sino-Japanese War.
In the Sino-Japanese War of 1937.. the Japanese conquered large parts of China... including Shanghai.
As it turned out, that was the only avenue of escape-
Shanghai- without papers.
All you needed really was passage on a ship.
What is not widely known, in '38, before the beginning of the war... you could get out of Dachau if you could leave the country.
If he could have left the country... he wouldn't have gotten smuggled into Belgium.
So, he was in Dachau for about 20 days.
During that time my mother found out... that you could go to the Japanese-occupied portion of Shanghai without a visa.
One did not need a visa to come to Shanghai.
But that is wrong.
Because visas were indeed required... in order to purchase a ship ticket.
Passport control, however... after July, 1937... was no longer in Chinese hands.
As a matter of fact, nobody controlled passports... because the foreign powers did not want to control passports... because then the Japanese would have said, "We want to control passports"... and the foreign powers... did not want the Japanese to control passports of foreigners... and therefore nobody controlled passports.
She decided to buy steamship tickets for Shanghai.
How did she have the money?
It wasn't that easy either.
We had money, but the bank accounts were frozen.
However, we were allowed to draw household expenses from our own moneys.
So my mother inflated, as much as she was able to, what she needed... and was very frugal on spending it.
But she did go and get the steamship tickets... for leaving on the Hakozaki Maru... a Japanese steamer... the following February from Naples, Italy.
My father was always very careful with money.
He had money put aside.
Most of that went for... bribing the NYK Line people to give us tickets... because if we hadn't gotten out by the middle of May...
I wouldn't be sitting here today.
I remember my grandfather- It's one of those things that sits in your ear-
You hear it.
He used to say to her, "Fuffchen. "
He called her Fuffchen.
"Where you taking the kid to?"
"To the Chinesin. "
"No, no. Forget it. "
He said, "Yeah.
I'm taking my boy. I'm getting out. "
On my mother's birthday, which was
December 5, 6:00 in the morning... the bell rang... and at that time if you heard a bell ring at any hour... but particularly at an ungodly hour, you might say... it did not sound too good.
I remember all of us huddling in the little hallway... as my mother opened the door, and there was my father.
He had come home from Buchenwald.
With much trepidation, she told my father...
"We're not waiting for a United States visa.
I got tickets to go to Shanghai. "
She expected him to make a big fuss... and all he said was... in today's vernacular...
"If we had left yesterday, it wouldn't be soon enough. "
We left Germany in...
1939 in May.
We said good-bye to my grandparents.
It was chaos.
My mother was screaming.
My aunt was screaming.
They were very volatile.
It was terrible. Awful.
And, you know, the Germans never came out to say good-bye.
They watched from behind the curtains.
We could see them, and they didn't come out.
They knew my mother since she was a little girl.
They didn't come out. They didn't say anything. They were really terrified... and also probably glad to see us leave.
At the train station there was the whole family there.
I see it like you’re sitting in front of me.
I see it like you're sitting in front of me.
Under Anhalter Bahnhofin Berlin.
Everybody.
Everybody. Bruno.
Omi-Sozia, Ada, Mietek.
The cousins-Judith, Margot.
All names today are-
It's a long time ago.
But a lot of people.
A lot of people.
And they're all gone.
I had to say good-bye to Anna-Marie, my girlfriend... and all of that.
I give talks in schools... and I talk about Anna-Marie, especially to the age group that- the nine-year-olds, the 10-year-olds.
I always talk about
Anna-Marie and say...
"If you ever hear about anyone called Anna-Marie Wallenberg... let me know. "
I get letters from them.
One little girl wrote a letter back, and she said...
"Don't worry if you don't find Anna-Marie.
When you go to heaven, you'll find her there. "
When the train reached the Italian border... and the Gestapo came on board the train... and my mother telling me...
"I want you to be very quiet.
Don't say a word.
Don't look up. Don't move.
Don't ask for anything.
Just sit. "
Funny how kids sometimes know that it's really serious business.
I was eight years old, and I did just that.
So I remember the Gestapo coming aboard the train to check papers... but I didn't see faces
'cause I was looking down.
My mother told me not to look up.
All I saw was black boots marching back and forth... and them saying "Papiere, " you know, "papers. "
The passports and whatever else was needed- the permission.
They went through the whole train... and after they got it from everybody, they left the train... and the train started again and crossed the border into Italy.
Everybody cheering and clapping.
They had champagne corks popping.
We were out of Germany.
Shanghai became a real option... for those Jews who had no place to go.
They scrambled to buy all the luxury ship tickets... to go to Shanghai... because that was the only way you can go at that point.
Got on the ship.
That was the Kashima Maru.
It was weird because it looked like a pleasure cruise... with the streamers and the music- the orchestra- a Japanese real snappy orchestra.
We thought we were on holiday, my sister and me.
I was nine, and she was 11.
So we had fun. We had a stewardess who was assigned to take care of us... and they gave us little cakes and little dolls.
We had tea parties.
We took a ship in Naples- a Japanese ship by the name of Hakusan Maru.
It was a beautiful four-week trip.
Long, beautiful trip.
I enjoyed every moment of it.
I didn't realize really what was going on in the world. We were too young for that.
My mother bought first-class passage.
So we had a relatively luxurious cabin... and there was more food than anyone could ever eat.
I remember vividly throughout the trip... my mother kept saying
I should eat everything in sight.
At that time we were kosher.
We basically ate the fruits... and the vegetables and much of the pastry.
In Port Said, the ship actually anchored... and I remember those sand dunes on both sides.
They later told us that a few young Jews-
German Jews, Polish Jews- jumped the ship... and actually tried to make their way to Palestine.
What's Israel today.
I don't know.
There was a recurrent theme.
She was saying, "Eat, eat, eat"... because who knows what will happen when we get to Shanghai.
Got off the ship in Shanghai... if I remember correctly... that was the shock of a lifetime.
It was completely different from anything you could imagine.
Absolutely different.
Nothing could prepare you for what we saw there.
I actually remember feeling very, very afraid.
I didn't know where I was.
I t was a whole different world... in overnight from white to black or from black to white.
In 1937, what was conquered was not the International Settlement... not the French Concession... but the Chinese portion of the town.
The Japanese did not want to establish a concession of their own... but they took a piece of the International Settlement... and that they said is under our military control.
And that is Hongko.
Hongko- or Hongke was some called it- was one of the poorest sections of Shanghai.
Badly battered in the war with the Japanese... it was home to poor Chinese... occupying Japanese and many Jewish refugees... who had little means to support themselves.
We landed in Hongkew, which is the place where all the ships landed- particularly the refugee ships.
It was very dirty.
It was terribly hot and very humid.
The heat is terrible there.
And crowded and smelly.
Thousands of people running around.
Chinese beggars with open sores.
It was just awful.
Shanghai was not prepared for this kind of an influx- for these waves and waves... shiploads- shipload after shipload.
One of my father's friends who had gone there before us... had rented us a room... in one of the little lanes that they have in Hongkew.
The room was fairly clean... but it was just one small room for our family... another small one for my uncle and my aunt.
No kitchen facilities. very poor bathroom situation.
No what they called WC's over there- water closet.
No flush toilets.
Buckets.
The first home was also on Wayside Road.
Further down on Wayside Road in a lane in an alley.
All of Shanghai was alleys and lanes.
Cars don't go through there. Bicycles.
With a wagon you can pull through there.
Very narrow, very crowded, very tight.
Not too much air.
Not too much light.
That's how people lived in those days.
So, a major problem arose already in December at the very beginning:
How to support these people, how to house these people... how to feed these people of already hundreds upon hundreds.
The Jewish Baghdadi families stepped in to help.
They established soup kitchens and temporary shelters called homes... or Hei me in German.
We were picked up by the Jewish Committee on trucks... and they took us to a camp... which was a converted school and a Kinchow camp.
The camp was normal. We had a little breakfast, a little lunch and no dinner.
We had to fend for ourselves.
We had a little money.
The first one to create what you call the international committee- or I CU- was the COMA Committee... which was subsidized by Sassoon. victor Sassoon said... that it was the cheapest place in the world to support a refugee.
For five American cents you could support a refugee.
But as more refugees were arriving daily, more help was needed.
The JDC- the Joint Distribution
Committee- took action.
It was an overseeing organization of Jewish-American communities... uniting their philanthropic efforts.
The JDC was the main source of hope and help for the refugees.
It financed the temporary shelters... the soup kitchens and the makeshift hospital.
Later, Laura Margolis, an American professional social worker... became the JDC's head official in Shanghai.
Under her effective management... the JDC was able to sustain close to 10,000 refugees... who had no means to support themselves.
One morning... the phone rang.
The boss at that time was Mo Levitt.
Moses Levitt.
He said, "Laura, how you doin'?"
Although "How you doin'?" was not an expression in those years.
But he said, "How are you?"
I said, "Fine. "
"Busy?"
"Yeah, we’re very busy here. "
He said,
"How would you like to go to China?"
I have to laugh when I think of it.
I said, "Where in China?"
"Shanghai. "
I said, "Sure. I'd like to go. "
I had no idea what he was talking about.
She came in May, 1941.
She was a professional social worker... who had worked in Cuba before that.
I found a news clipping in the Joint archives... describing "Laura Margolis from Cuba... is coming to straighten out the mess in Shanghai. "
Because you had the local relief organizations... by volunteers.
Laura Margolis, a highly intelligent woman... sent back weekly- sometimes even daily reports... describing precisely the situation as she saw it.
The relief organizations and how poorly they're managing... and the refugee problem and so on and so forth.
Now came the Polish Jews... and the Lithuanian Jews and the religious Jews and the yeshivot.
They wanted to be taken care of separately... because they were intellectuals... and they had to have their prayer books... and they had to have kosher food... and chicken on Friday.
It was very, very difficult.
Very difficult.
Yet again, the Jewish communities did try to accommodate them... did respond.
"These are religious people.
They need to be treated differently. "
So we went to the camp kitchens... for our first meals like everybody else did.
They had set up these homes- Heime- which didn't look much like Heim- or a home- for people who had no place to go.
They had kitchens, and they had a hospital.
Fortunately, we didn't have to live there.
That was even worse than living in the room- much worse.
It was kind of odd to see people there.
They all had these new German clothes they had bought before they left... if they had enough money left.
They were all decked out.
The men usually with hats and suits.
In that heat.
The women with nice suits and heels and all that... with a tin plate in their hand, waiting for food from the communal kitchen.
The summers would get so hot... that today you use a heat index or humidity index.
Under those conditions, the temperature could go up as much- measured that way-
140 in the shade.
The sanitary conditions were about the worst in the world that you can think of.
Every disease- known or unknown to man- was rampant in epidemic proportions.
Non-flushable toilet.
A Chinese woman would come every morning... pick that huge pot up... take it down the stairs and dump it into a wagon in the street.
So the street usually smelled not like Chanel Number 5.
You could not drink the water.
In Shanghai, at the time, you could not drink.
You drank water, guaranteed to get sick.
The older generation.
But when you were young, you do things.
I remember distinctly the first time
I drank the water from the tap.
You had to boil the water.
Eventually we were able- most of the younger people- to drink the water from the tap.
There was a way to do the rice that I remembered... and I usually tell that to people- how my mother used to put it out on the windowsill.
We had these wide windowsills.
If you left it sitting there for four or five minutes... the bugs would come crawling out.
My sister and I would count who had the most.
In summertime... the river would overflow on a regular basis.
Everyday, at certain hours, the streets were flooded.
You'd have swimming in there.
You name it, and it was swimming in there.
Most of the refugees came almost penniless to Shanghai.
The German government had confiscated most of their assets.
Many sold whatever salable items they had- clothes and furniture... which they brought from Europe in large crates called "lifts. "
The refugees now scrambled to find jobs in Shanghai to sustain themselves... although they did not know for how long.
My father had studied to be a typewriter mechanic before leaving Germany.
Also with the proceeds of what my mother sold... we established a typewriter business in the British foreign settlement... hiring a Chinese mechanic.
My mother stayed home.
She and my aunt knitted.
They opened up the old sweaters and the old shawls... and knitted for sale to make a little money.
My father and my uncle went to look for jobs in the city of Shanghai... with Chinese companies.
My father got a job with a chemical company... knowing absolutely nothing- not a shred of knowledge about chemicals.
But he learned.
He used to study every night.
She supported her husband and myself... with making hats.
She was an excellent hat maker.
Since the climate was cold, people wore hats.
The hope was always... create a temporary refuge so they can get to America... or elsewhere in the western hemisphere-
Canada, South America.
Nobody expected Shanghai to be a refuge for 10 years.
It was unintended to be more than anything temporary.
As bad as were offin Shanghai... we were still better off than most of the Chinese around us.
The Chinese were very poor, very hardworking... and were under direct oppression of the Japanese.
The poorer Chinese people... lived even... a poorer life than the Jewish refugees, it seemed.
The relief organization helped the refugees- the Jewish refugees- according to their standard.
The Chinese had this coexistence with the refugees- a sort of benign tolerance.
They had their own problems.
They kind of accepted us in their midst there.
I never once saw a sign of anti-Semitism... or disgust or criticism.
I never saw it at all.
The lot of the Chinese people was a very hard one to watch... beginning with the coolies- these poor guys who were carrying all daylong... and then the rickshaws.
A human being lugging a little wagon with two wheels... and rich people and running with them through the streets for hours and days... with the veins popping out of their legs.
It's inhuman.
The wintertime, there was no heating... and some just froze to death.
Then you'd see in the streets in the morning... little packages wrapped up where the children passed away... and they wrapped them up in a little straw mattress... and when the garbage truck came, they just picked them up.
Children play with other children.
It doesn't matter whether-
My sister writes in her diary...
"I gave the little Chinese girl next door a piece of white bread. "
Big deal, you know.
That's the way this worked.
Herfather gave me a pencil.
That's how these things evolved.
They didn't make lifelong friendships out of this... but they coexisted quite well.
So there was never-
We were lucky with that. After all, we were sitting on their territory...
20,000 of us pushing20,000 of them out... because they were already there... and overflowing, living really in poverty, many of them.
Because that was the poor section of town.
On the one hand, the white and the Chinese were simply two different worlds. very few understood Chinese or spoke Chinese.
What refugees had a lot to do with Chinese was in pidgin English.
They bought from them.
They bought the cheapest- the last bit of vegetables... and what was left in the stands when nobody else would buy... when they couldn't afford anything else.
Sometimes the Chinese were very good to the refugees.
They gave them credit, or they let them buy on credit.
There was this very sweet Chinese man... who came with his bamboo stick with two little baskets hanging on each side... and became a real friendship with my mother.
Used to come by-
I don't know about everyday- but very often- a good few times a week.
Then he'd be downstairs-
We lived on the second floor- and he used to call, "Ufi. Ufi, " and then my mother went down.
He had some vegetables... or fish and some chicken.
He always had something that she bought from him.
"Ufi. " She was his best customer.
In Shanghai... there was a Russian newspaper... for the Russian community.
And in this paper there was a Yiddish page.
In that Yiddish page... they recorded their reaction to Shanghai.
It is the most beautiful, heartwarming poetry that I've read.
I mean, it is just-
It's not self-pitying.
Some of the poems are sort of reaching out to the Chinese population.
Like, "Oh, my God.
This is terrible what is happening to you. "
This kind of sympathetic response.
So it comes straight from the heart.
Instead of saying, "Oy, poor me. "
You know,
" Gevalt! Who did this to me?"
They're saying,
"Oh, no. You poor Chinese. "
The utmost influence... the Jews asserted... on the Shanghai Chinese society... was on music and on medicine.
The Chinese themselves, many of them felt also sympathy for the Jews.
They're both being oppressed by the Japanese.
The Chinese worse. When the Chinese crossed a bridge they had to bow down... and Japanese sometimes stick 'em with a burning cigarette... or jab them.
But the Chinese got the better part of it.
They turned around and smiled.
And that killed the Japanese.
In other words, their smile-
In other words, they withstood the torture and the embarrassment... and said you-know-what to them in that language.
That hurt the Japanese more than anything else.
Every Chinese hated the Japanese very much.
Theykilled300,000people... when they occupied Nanjing.
I saw once... a Chinese stealing a canister of kerosene... and he was caught.
Right on the spot the Japanese tied up his hands... and chopped them off.
And that's it.
I couldn’t watch.
I ran away.
But in my opinion, man could never survive.
Although passport control was not in anyone's hands after 1937... the Japanese controlled the Shanghai harbor.
In spite of their alliance with Germany... they let the Jewish refugees into Shanghai.
I t is quite clear that they do not wish to antagonize American Jews.
They do not wish to antagonize world Jewry... because this stereotype of the Jew, which is still alive today in Japan... was very much alive then.
Jews are rich,
Jews have power...
Jews control governments.
Jews are compared to a blowfish or fugu.
If the skilled chef... can know how to cut the little poisonous sac out of the fish, it's a delicacy.
If not, it's a poisonous thing.
If we have such a great power like the Jews... we have to know how to utilize them on behalf of Japan.
Japanese had to be very careful... about being prejudiced against Jews... because they had complained... about German prejudice against Asians.
So, it was the Japanese,
Hitler's Axis partner... that determined, based on their concept of what the Jew was in the world- on their control of the West... and Western Jews being synonymous in their ideas- they thought, "If we are good to the Jews in East Asia, they will be good to us. "
Meanwhile, war was raging in Europe.
In September, 1939,
Germany invaded Poland.
In 1940, Denmark.
Then the Netherlands, Belgium... then France.
It seemed like
Hitler was unstoppable.
The beginning looked like total devastation- we don't have a chance.
The Germans were running across Europe... and the Japanese were storming all across Asia.
Till things started turning around, we didn't really know. It looked hopeless.
We got once a postcard from my grandfather.
We tried in Shanghai... to get some of my mother's family out... or my father's, but it was too late.
You had to go via Siberia, and as I said to you... the war was on already, and you could not come anymore.
My other uncle, though-
Leo who had gone to Paris- when he saw that it wasn't that great in France... he wrote my mother he’d like to come to Shanghai.
My mother immediately got things moving.
The European part of HIAS was called HICEM. H-I-C-E-M.
She went to the HICEM... in Shanghai... and sent papers.
At that particular time... you needed- it wasn't really sponsors... but you needed somebody to write a letter to say you wanted somebody to come.
It was very easy.
It was a semiofficial kind of thing.
There was no problem.
We did the same thing.
The HICEM took care of it.
And we got another letter from my uncle... that he was now interned at Septfonds.
"Please get me out as quickly as you can. "
My mother couldn't understand.
Why didn't he get the papers?
She went to the HICEM, and he assured her the papers were sent.
Well, nothing happened, and finally my mother got very upset... and she went back to the HICEM, and she says...
"You know, it doesn't take that long for papers to get to Europe.
Something must have happened. "
The man said, "No. We sent them. "
"I want the receipt... because you said you sent them registered mail.
I want the receipt that you sent them. "
They weren’t very nice to her, but she wouldn’t leave the office.
Finally he took out his file... and the way she said, his face blanched.
She said, "What's the matter?"
He said, "The papers were never sent.
They're in this file. "
So, my mother says...
"I'm gonna take the papers, and I will send them. "
She took the papers, 'cause they had to go to the HICEM in Marseille... and they he could have gotten on a ship.
She took the papers... and she immediately sent them out, registered mail.
They got to the HICEM in Marseille the day France fell.
They never reached my uncle.
To the day she died... my mother said, "Leo's gonna think his sister deserted him... that his sister didn't want him to come. "
She always spoke about that- how she sent him these papers.
They were overworked,
I guess- the HICEM.
She always says, "Why didn't I ask to see the file earlier? Why, why?"
Because he could have come.
There were various schools available in Shanghai... including French and British schools.
There was also the Kadoorie school in Hongkew.
It was built and financed by the Kadoorie and Sassoon families for the refugees... and was staffed by refugee teachers.
There was also an existing school: the Shanghai Jewish School... which was administered by these two families... the Sassoon and Kadoories.
It was a private school.
You had to pay tuition
If you could not pay tuition, you went for free.
It was a school run under the British school system.
The curriculum was made up in Cambridge, England... was sent to Shanghai, meticulously followed.
Examination papers were sent back to Cambridge for marking... and then returned to Shanghai.
There were kosher lunches... and there was a big, beautiful Sephardic synagogue, still in existence today... on the grounds of the Shanghai Jewish School.
Had a very, very lovely
English lady... in our Shanghai Jewish School-
Mrs. Beresford- who every weekend... would take from her class... one kid to her house.
I remember I was there twice.
Her son was a boy named Maxwell Beresford.
That was in downtown Shanghai.
They were beautiful- beautiful woman, beautiful people- and for two days you lived again in a different world.
When we kids had nothing to do... in the afternoon, after school... we got active and we had athletic competitions.
We had a soccer league, where we played soccer every weekend.
There also was a small boxing club... because there were some Jews from Germany-
Some of them were champion of Germany.
They had a little time on their hands... and they started to teach us to be boxers.
We had a very good boxing league.
I was pretty good.
I was very good at boxing.
I had a very strong right.
I won most of my fights by knockout.
Now as a man of72 years old... it doesn't look the same and it doesn't feel the same... but I was very strong and I was very good.
So were others in our group.
They were really good.
We had good trainers and we trained very hard.
We took enormous pride to win.
All of us wore the Magen David, which was important.
When you're always on the bottom, and everybody spits and laughs at you... you are finally on even keel-
It was important.
Here you have a community... that despite these disadvantages that I mentioned to you... created a viable cultural life... that would have done justice to a city of 100,000.
Newspapers, dailies, weeklies, monthlies-
An incredible array of newspapers.
Of course one person bought it... then gave it out to 10 other people to read.
These were read and read and reread until they were torn.
From Vienna, the sausages and bakery and other things-
The café house, which was a standard in Vienna and Germany... they brought to Shanghai.
Architects created a whole new area... where the bombed-out part of Hongkew had been rebuilt... to create apartments, rooms for refugees.
They created a theater, and this included a German theater and a Yiddish theater.
They had cabaret evenings in these little restaurants... that were fabulous.
We would go there-
Once in a great while my father would come out... with enough money for us to go to one of these places.
We would go there, and we'd listen to them sing and make jokes.
People like Herbert Zernik and Raya Zomina- she sang in Yiddish.
These two were so funny, and they were so good.
There was a lot of that going on.
You have this attempt... to bring some kind of cultural life.
It's not only the café houses.
It's not only recreating Little Vienna or Little Berlin... as some people have written.
It is much more.
Several newspapers-
The Gelb Reports, Shanghai Chronicle-
Many more that stopped and started.
Even books.
Poetry. People were writing wonderful poetry in German... not only in Yiddish.
It is that kind of thing which I think is moving.
Among the squalor, the poverty, the hunger... and this feeling of,
"What's going to be with us?
Where will all this end?
Will it ever end?"... there still is the human spirit reasserting itself.
The Jewish refugees built... an almost self-sufficient, beautiful society.
There's sports clubs, there's soccer clubs... there are recreation clubs, there are boxers.
It's an amazing story.
My father had come out of Buchenwald... where his war wound had acted up and had not been treated.
He got sick, then he got well, then he got sick.
He got checkups.
They didn't know what it was.
They pulled his teeth, they thought it was that.
He kept getting fevers, and it was called "Shanghai Fever. "
But he functioned and ran the business with a Chinese mechanic.
My mother went knocking on doors getting customers.
She did the bookkeeping, she did the correspondence and appointments.
My father did the repairs together with a Chinese mechanic.
Then he got sick again... and he died, just like that.
He was 43years old.
They were never sure what it was... but they presume it was some kind of a parasite... that he harbored from Buchenwald.
When he fought in the First World War... he was at the Battle of Verdun in France... which was a very big, important battle.
I think it was in 1916.
He was born in 1897... so he was about 19 years old.
He was a kid, really.
As he was standing with his gun... he sees a young French soldier... on the other side of him, opposite him.
That's the enemy... so naturally you shoot your enemy or he's gonna shoot you.
My father tells the story.
He sees this French soldier... and he raises his gun to shoot him.
At the same moment that he's shooting the soldier... the soldier shoots him.
And as my father fell-
He had a stomach wound, lying there- he heard the young French soldier say, "Shema Israel. "
That always affected him.
He killed a Jew.
All of a sudden, he wasn’t a German soldier killing a French soldier... it was a Jew killing a Jew.
It affected him all his life.
It must have, because he always told that story... and then my mother repeated it.
Although the situation in Shanghai was bad... it was far better than Europe, where war was still raging.
The refugees felt relatively safe in Shanghai under Japanese occupation.
That was about to change.
In December, 1941...
Japan attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor.
The United States entered the war.
Pearl Harbor was not only a major shock... which verified to some that the Gestapo had a long arm... and it reached out to the Far East.
It was a double shock.
Here they thought, "We have difficulties, but we're out of danger from Germany. "
All of a sudden, with Pearl Harbor they find Germany and Japan are allies... and Germans again are involved in their affairs.
We got very frightened.
With America at war, we're not going to get out of Shanghai.
Looked out the window... and all the ships in the harbor were burning.
Japanese had come across the bridge... marched into our hotel, occupied the hotel.
We were at war.
The Japanese quickly took over the International Settlement.
The British and the Americans were now enemies of Japan... and were regarded as prisoners of war.
The Japanese imprisoned them... in internment camps at the outskirts of Shanghai.
That group included the Baghdadi Jews who were also British subjects.
The Sephardic community, which had been helping the refugees... was no longer in the elite position that they were before.
They themselves were reduced... as to how much money they could take out of the bank.
Most of their money was confiscated.
Within three quarters of a year or so- certainly by the end of the year- all the enemy aliens- meaning American, British and Dutch nationals- were interned.
I remember when they locked all the British up.
A few of our guys- I was with them- knew where the camp was.
Long way to walk, the way I remember it today.
We gathered whatever we could steal- some cans, some this, some that.
We walked for kilometers, the way I remember it.
We brought them some. They were all locked up in the British camp.
We paid back.
With America at war with Japan... all lines of communication between
Shanghai and the US were suddenly cut.
Laura Margolis was cut off... without money coming from America to support the soup kitchens... the local shelters and the makeshift hospital.
Foreseeing such a problem, she had already obtained permission from the JDC... to borrow money from local businessmen... who were confident that they would be repaid by the JDC... at the end of the war, as indeed they were.
But without the Japanese approving the operation... everything could fall apart... leaving thousands of refugees with no means to support themselves.
So I phoned up Captain I nuzuka.
He remembered me... because we had been to social affairs together... and received me very nicely.
Made the tea ceremony, very nice, very cordial.
Then we got to the nitty-gritty of what I came for.
It's true that I'm an enemy alien.
I don't know what’s going to happen with me next.
But for the foreseeable future, apparently I'm free.
I would be able to take over the whole operation in Shanghai... and keep feeding the people... if he would give me permission to raise the money.
I said...
"You, as an occupying power... can not afford to have hungry people riot.
You're responsible for them.
On the other hand...
I can help you so they won't riot... if you’ll give me an okay... to raise the money. "
And he did.
The war years were very difficult years... in the sense that there wasn't enough food... and everybody had dysentery.
Having diarrhea was just usual.
Food got to be very difficult in '43, '44, '45.
There wasn't a lot of food.
Lot of people were clearly suffering from malnutrition.
You had a sense-
As a young kid, I remember... the people were shrinking into their clothes.
They looked gaunt and shabby.
Little Chinese boys would be chasing grocery trucks.
They'd have a knife.
They'd cut a hole in the sack.
The noodles would fall into the gutter.
They'd sweep them up, and they would be sold very cheaply.
Then my mother and I would sit around the kerosene lamp... or whatever was available in the way of light... and we’d separate the noodles from the debris.
Debris being broken glass, rusty nails, stones- whatever is swept up from a gutter.
I remember we were sitting on the balcony once-
Werner, my second father, and I-
Tiny little balcony.
My mother was in the streets.
She had just bought bread.
And we saw some young kid came up... grabbed the bread from her arm and started running.
When she came up, she said, "He must have been even hungrier than we are. "
Those were-
There wasn't much of anything.
Since the Baghdadi Jews were imprisoned in internment camps with the British...
Laura Margolis called upon the Russian Jews to help the refugees.
The responsibility for the refugees... fell now on the Russian Jews.
And I would say-
They had no choice, but we accept the responsibility.
But also they did their best.
They cannot be faulted.
After that, they simply had to do whatever was possible.
My parents and quite a few other people... had their kids go to a Catholic school.
Saint Francis Xavier's College-
SFX- which was an all-boys school.
Discipline extremely strict.
If I learned anything at all, that's where I learned it.
It was a Catholic school. All brothers, with the long black gowns.
Religious Catholics from all over the world-
Brother Leo,
Brother Ladislaus from Hungary.
There was one big redhead,
Brother John.
I'll never forget... every morning when we walked into school...
Brother John would give us... a little insight into what the political situation was.
He was very, very anti-Allies.
He was very much pro-German and pro-Japanese.
He was a real nice guy. He was very nice, especially to us Jewish kids... and yet... his actions showed different and the words that came out of his mouth were different.
After the war was over... it came out that Brother John was actually a very high officer in the British army.
He was no brother.
Not a religious man, but set up in there.
Apparently he was one of those... that gave a lot of information of what was going on in Shanghai... as far as the the Japanese army was concerned, to the Allied forces.
The refugee community was very worried what was happening... because after all the enemy aliens of Japan and Germany were interned... what was gonna happen to us?
Knowing that Jews were always first in line... when it came to bad things happening to good people, so to speak... what did they have in store for us?
On February 18, 1943... the Japanese issued a proclamation... ordering all stateless refugees who came to Shanghai after 1937.. to move to a segregated area in Hongkew.
That's when the German influence became much more crucial.
German influence pressured the Japanese into creating a ghetto.
This was the tendency of the Japanese in ruling.
Here this whole puppet-state concept comes into play.
If you have them nice and compact all together... you can watch them and you know what they're doing.
Then what you do is you give them... someone to watch over them.
No direct rule.
That's the puppet government that watches over them.
It's exactly what they did in Shanghai.
It wasn't a real ghetto.
It wasn't a ghetto that we know from Europe. It wasn't that.
It was a different concept.
It was a very Japanese concept.
And yes, all foreigners need to be watched.
The ghetto didn't have any walls around.
It didn't have to... because if you saw a European face in downtown Shanghai... and they were not German or Russian, they had to be one of us... because all the Americans and all the
British were put into internment camps.
So we moved into that ghetto area.
My mother sold a bunch of the possessions we had just to make room.
We had a very tiny room.
There were at the end- three, four, six- ten people in this house.
We lived in a Chinese house owned by a Jew... but there were five families in a ghetto... and we had the attic which was like this.
We were not able to stand straight, only in the middle of the attic.
On the side it went all the way down.
The major problem we had was my brother contracted polio in China... which was a disaster.
Food was scarce.
Eventually we couldn't get out from the ghetto anymore... so I started a job.
I worked in the kitchen.
The school had a kitchen.
We all had to move into one room to 51 Chusan Road... which was right smack in the middle of the ghetto.
They never called it a ghetto.
They called it a segregated area... but it was a ghetto.
I went back there too... and took a look.
Yes.
- We lived upstairs, you know?
- There you go.
Take care.
- Be careful on the steps.
- Take care.
Yes, on the steps.
It all comes back.
It all comes back.
The roof looks the same.
It's amazing how it didn't change.
I can't believe it.
We used to have the rice on this windowsill... and take the bugs out of the rice- my sister and me.
There was another window and we had a little kitchen... where there's now a wall here... with one little stove, two rings of gas.
We never used it because we didn't have enough gas.
And a little sink with cold water running.
We put a curtain across it... so that nobody would come in when we washed ourselves.
Never took a bath during the war, just sponge bath...
'cause the bathroom down the hall was so dirty.
Everything comes back.
We did everything in this room.
We lived here... we slept here, we argued here.
I learned to dance in this room with my father... to the radio.
Voice of America. We tried to get it, but it was forbidden... so we had to be very careful.
My mother always had flowers on the table.
You could buy flowers.
All the time we were wondering what happened in Germany.
We didn't know what was going on... all during the war.
It's just amazing how it all comes back.
To exit the ghetto for jobs or school... the refugees had to get special passes.
The Japanese authorities were represented by two officials;
Akura and Goya.
Goya- They called him "Meshuggener Goya" or "Paranoid Goya"- who had a-
He was really schizophrenic in many ways.
I'm giving you not a professional evaluation.
He could be very good to the children.
He'd give out candies to children.
He loved to play music, even though he was a lousy musician.
He always forced the refugees to play with him.
He liked to be called "King of the Jews. "
He was a short, ugly fellow.
He would stand on the desk and yell at some Jews.
There was one Jew who really caught his psychology.
A brilliant idea.
He saw the kind of person he was.
He had a silk top hat he'd put on.
He gambled.
He'd say, "You're making fun of me?"
He wore a silk hat when he went down the line to get a pass.
He said, "No, I only wear it... when I meet royalty and important people. "
He caught onto the psychology of that person... and he was always put in front of the line.
Anytime he came, he got his pass immediately.
Mr. Goya was a very short, little man... and my stepfather Werner was a very tall man.
He was about 6 foot 2, 6 foot 3.
The little Japanese man didn't like that.
So he pulled out his gloves... and he slapped my father across the face.
He jumped on the table and slapped him across the face... and yelled at him to get out and "no pass. "
I remember
Werner coming home that day... and he was a shattered, broken man.
So now my mother's typewriter business... definitely was down the drain altogether... because many refugees now were not just dying of disease... they were dying of starvation, because there was so little food around.
And what she decided was a ruse.
She wrote to one of her customers in the French Concession, a French lady... and asked her to send a letter... saying that she was still servicing her typewriter.
The lady wrote that letter.
Armed with that letter... she made an application for a special pass with Mr. Goya.
She stood in front of Goya, and Goya said, "You repair typewriters?"
She says, "Yes, I was in business.
My husband died here, but it was his business originally.
I still know how to repair them. "
She got a pass, and armed with that pass... she decided what she was gonna do.
She had no intention of servicing typewriters.
She got a pass to go to the French Concession.
What she did that was not legal... she got off the tram before she got to the French Concession.
She went to the parts of the city... where Westerners did not go, the Chinese parts.
She bought up sundries like sunglasses... nylon stockings, belts, scarves, stuff like that.
She would put them under the toolbox that she carried with her... and bring them back to the ghetto area... and then give them to the peddlers on consignment in the ghetto.
Even though it didn't bring in much money... it brought in just enough... to keep us slightly above the starvation level.
One night when my parents thought I was asleep... they were talking to one another... and my mother said that there were only $17 left.
I had no idea what 17-
It was a fair amount of money... but it was clear that when that was gone... we would be in terrible shape.
We had what they called a "paocha"... so the Japanese didn't have to do it... and we were happy they didn't have to do it.
Everybody was assigned a couple of hours a week... where you got an official armband and a stick... and you were standing and controlling... that the people don't go out without a pass- out of the ghetto without a pass- and that they came in on time.
But as I said to you,
I worked for Russians... and there was a Russian club.
The Jews that had Soviet passports could live outside the ghetto.
They had the radio and everything... and they got movies of the war going on with Germany.
The way to get back into the ghetto after the hour-
What I did is-
The ghetto did not have a wall around it.
This side of the street was the ghetto, the other side was not the ghetto.
So I walked on the other side of the street which was not the ghetto.
There was one street where the police station was.
Just as I came to the police station...
I walked across the street and into the police station.
If anybody would ask,
I'm going in to the police... but then I looked around, said, "I think I'm in the wrong place"... and I walked out again.
This was maybe 10:00 at night.
Anywhere else I walked... they would have caught me going into the ghetto at 10:00.
I was supposed to be home by 6:00.
There was this White Russian boy.
He was good friends with the Japanese kids there.
Whenever he got a hold of me,
I got my daily-
If I couldn't run fast enough,
I got my daily beating.
I remember one time I came home, my mother almost fainted.
A black eye and bleeding, no shirt, one shoe missing-
I took a bad beating.
George was his name.
Family name's not important.
George and his gang, always two or three guys. They get you.
I used to go to bed at night,
I remember that vividly... and I’d say, "Someday, I don't know,
I will get even.
I have to get even.
This can't go on. "
I took a beating maybe three or four times a week.
They'd catch you, you'd get it.
Butter was very valuable, very expensive.
I recall that my parents-
Later on there wasn't any butter, but my parents in '43, '44... would buy half a quarter of butter, two ounces... and they would watch and make sure that I ate it.
I remember once, vividly... walking out where my mother was washing the dishes.
I noticed that she licked the last bit of butter off the plate.
Till we moved into our-
Can't say a flat-
Till we moved into a room of a larger flat... which was shared... by probably four or five families-
11, 12 people all in all.
We had one room in there.
Bathroom facilities, if you can call it that... shared by about 11, 12 people, if I remember correctly.
In that one room, my mother made hats... and that's where we lived and slept and worked.
I can't explain.
I don't think people today... will understand what this is all about unless you see it.
Here we had our windows painted black... and if a little light would shine out... the Japanese would be cursing from the streets.
I don’t want to tell you what they cursed.
I could repeat it if I wanted to.
They used to yell from down there,
Bagero!
If a little light shone out, they'd come smashing the doors in.
So we made sure the windows were all blacked... with shmattes covering so nothing would shine out.
Werner and Fufi would lie under the blanket at night.
They had a tiny little radio- I don't know where they got that one from- and all covered up, they'd listen to the news.
Fufi understood a little Russian... so they used to listen to the news in
Russian- what happened in World War II.
We'd hear from the Soviet Union... that the Russian armies had started turning things around... and pushing the Germans back.
That gave us a little bit of hope- gave us a little bit of hope for the future.
It didn't all seem that bleak in those days.
Otherwise, that's about it.
From here we went to school, here we came home after we got beat up.
This room has a lot of history.
My mother was a very fine lady.
She made big pots of soup with all sorts of things inside... and then she fed another three or four people... who came for lunch on a steady basis.
There was a painter,
Kurt Frankenstein.
There was a Mr. Rouget who in turn taught me Russian for the food he ate.
There was another gentleman whose name I forget right now.
We always had three people... eating the same soup every day for lunch. I remember them.
Yeah, my mom was a nice lady.
She was a good gal.
In the place where we worked, we had a map... and every day... we put pins in for the advances of the Russian army... or the German-
We had the news through the Russian club.
We had the newspaper in the ghetto, in German.
And the official news came through.
The victorious German army withdrew from Harkoff.
We knew they got kicked out of Harkoff.
Shanghai, apart of the Japanese empire... was under attack by American forces, mostly by air.
So far up to this point...
Shanghai itself had not been bombed.
There were strafings.
We'd see Japanese and American fighter planes up in the sky.
Kids have no fear.
We’d be up on the roof.
We'd bet with marbles who would shoot down whom... as shrapnel was falling all around us.
When I think of it now, how foolish.
We could have gotten killed.
But nobody ever got hurt by that.
I don't know.
We must have been immune.
They would push the dining room tables together... and put mattresses on top and we would crawl underneath... and that was supposed to be a shelter.
It was July 17, 1945.
My mother was on one of her illegal forays in the city.
I was on my way to see Sue and Chaya, who were living together.
They lived on the exact opposite end of the ghetto from where I lived.
It was a very, very hot summer day... and in Shanghai the clouds used to hang... just a couple hundred meters above your head. You would choke.
There was an air raid alarm in the morning... and then it was called off.
I think two or three times and called off.
I remember I went to a haircut.
I'm walking down the road... and I stopped-
Next to the prison was a hospital.
And that hospital had become a prison hospital... for American and British POWs.
They always had them out on a balcony on a top floor... which was maybe the fifth or sixth floor.
We used to stop there and wave to them.
Sure they must have been wondering who we were.
They used to wave back and we'd wave to them.
Suddenly you thought the world was coming to an end.
Absolutely the world- Afterwards they said it was about a hundred B-29s... over Shanghai, just over the clouds.
That's a-
That's a ear-cracking noise.
It is unbearable.
Just as I'm starting to continue to walk over there... the dreaded siren went off that the city was under attack.
No bomb shelter, but a trench.
Jumped into a trench with some other people... and within a split second the bombs were flying.
And then the bombs started flying.
The bombs, when they go down, they go-
You hear that whistle.
I'll never forget that whistle... right before the thud.
We were always taught when the bombs start falling... you take an inside post of the building.
Never stand in the middle.
So everybody ran, grabbed some inside post of a building.
People screaming, and then you heard the sirens of the ambulances.
It was over very, very quickly.
Then we started running home.
Thirty-one refugees died, as well as hundreds of Chinese... in an attack by American forces... trying to hit a Japanese radio station in Hongkew.
The Japanese were terrific.
They had supplied the ghetto hospital... with medications and emergency equipment... in the event there would be a disaster.
They had the ambulances.
They came and they took care of everything immediately.
Didn't matter whether you were Chinese or white or green or yellow.
We had shrapnel coming into the window of the room where we lived... on my sister's bed, actually.
On her pillow.
And I kept that piece for many, many years.
You could see the evidence of the destruction all over the place.
There were shells of houses... and you could see that only walls had remained where houses had been. and there was rubble strewn everywhere.
I n the afternoon we went for a walk around the district... and that was devastating.
Dead bodies, blood, this, that-
I remember I couldn't fall asleep for a whole month.
I used to sit in bed all night long with nightmares... and I couldn't fall asleep.
I couldn't do my schoolwork.
My head was just not there anymore.
Then we heard about the first atomic bomb... on Hiroshima, then on Nagasaki.
We said, "Oh, my God. They're now going to drop it on Shanghai. "
It was a terrible fear for us... because we knew Shanghai was a military target.
Otherwise, why would there be strafings on the outskirts?
After the war was over, it suddenly got very quiet on the streets.
That was in August when that part of the war was over.
It got very quiet out there and the Japanese soldiers were gone.
We looked out through the blackout curtains... and there was nobody out there.
We waited a while to see if it was safe... and then we went out and there was nothing.
They were gone from the check posts around the ghetto.
They were out of there.
That's when we found out that it was over.
And when the war was over... we were in good shape.
We're strong kids, played a lot of soccer.
I went out to the streets.
Everybody was running wild. The Jews-
Suddenly, everything opened up.
I went out and two buddies came with me.
I went to look for George Bremen.
George Bremen saw me from a block away... and he knew this was the end, and he started running.
But I ran like a wild animal... so he couldn't have gotten away from me, no way.
I got a hold of George Bremen, and I was never a violent kid.
If those two guys would not have been with me-
I probably lost my mind.
I probably would have killed him.
I let out three, four years of anger... lots of pain.
I hit him with everything I could... and if those two boys weren't there,
I probably would have killed him... because I lost all humanity at that time too.
After the war was over... the Red Cross released lists of surviving family members in Europe.
The refugees rushed to see who survived.
Few did.
Soon after, news of what happened in Europe reached the refugees.
I remember we got a few letters... from the Warsaw ghetto, which I have... where my Uncle Mietek... wrote to his sister, my mother... if there’s anything she can do to help us get out of the Warsaw ghetto... and of course there was nothing to do.
There was nothing to do.
I have some of the letters in Polish, in German.
They're very sad letters... of „Help us get out of here," but there was nothing my mother could do.
A completely lost situation.
And those were the last letters.
I always admired the people that resisted.
I've taught my children that.
I thought by being an athlete, showing a different way of a Jew... that I contributed something... that we Jews are different and it can never happen again.
It won’t happen again.
I will have nothing to do with Germany.
Germany decimated my whole family.
Germany changed my whole life.
My father who fought for the country-
In my mind, they murdered him.
I have no aunts and uncles that I know of.
I grew up without cousins.
My mother had a very difficult life.
Everything was taken away from her.
I can't forget that.
Jewish life continues... which is not guaranteed, unfortunately.
I always say that if my grandchildren don't grow up Jewish...
Hitler won the war.
And it's a problem.
Anti-Semitism never bothered me as much as assimilation.
Most of the rest of the family... that I'd gotten to know from our yearly visits-
I spent a month or two in Poland every summer- did not survive.
When we heard about the concentration camps...
I remember vividly... that my only recollection of some of the people that did not survive... were things that I was very unhappy about.
That was long before
I learned about survivor guilt... because there was the feeling of we had survived and they had not.
I remember the last time I saw-
One of my cousins who lived in Dembitz... and his mother and I understand his father survived-
I was always very jealous of him.
He was clearly the brightest of all the cousins.
We must have had eight, nine cousins.
When we get together, he could solve any puzzle and stump the rest of us.
But he was physically somewhat more awkward than I... and I remember vividly that the last time we got together...
I had a big fight with him... and his eyeglasses were broken.
I remember when I heard after the war that he had not survived... that was the only memory that kept coming back to me.
How could I possibly have fought with him the last time I saw him?
But on the whole they didn't know what was happening... so they focused on their own life and on the misery of life in Shanghai.
Lo and behold, after the war they found out they're living in paradise... compared to what happened to their brethren in Europe.
That's what it was.
It's all a relative thing.
You don't know you’re living in paradise until you're kicked out.
After American liberation... the living conditions in Shanghai improved greatly.
In the following years... all the refugees left Shanghai and China... and spread around the world.
The Israeli government had chartered three small Greek ships.
These three ships sailed up the Yangtze River, the Whangpoo... with Israeli flags... which is still a very moving moment to me... because obviously if there were an Israel... there wouldn't have been a Holocaust.
It's as simple as that.
Of course, anybody who wanted to was welcome to go aboard the ship.
And no one-
These are still moving moments for me.
No one was ever asked for a visa or for a ship's passage... and if that had been true we wouldn't have been in Shanghai... and there wouldn’t have been six million
Jews killed during the Second World War.
Many of the Jews in Shanghai did go to Israel... and others- most came to the United States, some to Australia.
We came to the United States on a US troop transport- the SS Marine Lynx... which was a beautiful ship for transporting the US Army.
Beautiful ship that took us from Shanghai... through Yokohama and Hawaii to San Francisco.
Couple thousand Jewish refugees on the ship.
Ship got into San Francisco
3:00 in the morning.
I thought the ocean would overflow with all the tears of the refugees... when they see San Francisco at 3:00 in the morning.
But on the transcontinental train from San Francisco to New York...
I happened to be on the train with two black soldiers.
And usually as soon as the train would stop... we'd get off just to stretch our legs, get a different environment.
We got off at Albuquerque, the black soldiers didn't get off.
I didn't understand why.
Then I walked into the station... and there's a sign,
"White Men" and "Colored Men. "
I remember vividly
I felt as if I had been slapped.
I also felt that I couldn't face the black soldiers.
It's not that I was that racially conscious at the time.
Of course I knew about discrimination.
It wasn’t anything new to me.
But I'd never encountered it firsthand since we left Germany.
And the one thing I learned... having lived among
Japanese and Chinese people... is that I can't find it in myself to hate a nation... or a people.
Oh, wait a minute.
I forgot to do my test.
What test is that?
Well, I select a sandwich at random and try it.
If it doesn't meet my standards,
I put the lot of them in the bin.
They're fine.
There.
Ferrero Rocher?
Father Ted, with these Rocher you are realy spoiling us.
My housekeeper isn't the best.
Sometimes I think that it's me that should be making the tea for her!
Mrs Doyle.
(Ted) Mrs Doyle.
"Making the tea for her"!
I never thought we'd have anyone like her here.
Hm? Oh, Miss Clark. Yes, it's very exciting - a famous novelist, here.
You've never read any of her books, have you?
Actualy, I'm a bit of a fan.
That's where I was the other day - at her book signing.
I'm very surprised. I didn't think you'd like that sort of thing.
I read a bit of one once.
God, I couldn't finish it.
The language - unbelievable!
It's a bit gritty but that's the modern world.
Well, it was a bit much for me, Father.
- "Feck this" and "feck that".
- Yes, Mrs Doyle.
"You big bastard".
Oh, dreadful language.
"You big hairy arse".
"You big fecker".
Fierce stuff.
And of course, the F-word, Father.
The bad F-word, worse than "feck".
You know the one I mean?
Yes, I do, Mrs Doyle.
"F you". "F your F-ing wife".
Oh, why do they have to use language like that?
"I'll stick this F-ing pitchfork up your hole".
- That was another one, oh, yes.
- I see what you mean.
"Bastard this" and "bastard that".
It's wall-to-wall bastards.
- Is it? Anyway...
- "You bastard". "You fecker".
"You bollocks".
"Get your bollocks out of my face".
Yes, you just go and prepare for the nuns.
(Mrs Doyle) "Ride me sideways" is another one.
Happy Christmas, Mrs Doyle.
Oh, Father, you shouldn't have!
(Giggles) What is it?
It's a...
I was trying to think,
"What would Mrs Doyle realy love?"
Then I thought, "Something to take the misery out of making tea."
Yes, Mrs Doyle, the days of housekeepers making tea are over.
You've made your last cup of tea in this house!
Thank you, Father.
- Tea, Father?
- Oh! God Almighty, Mrs Doyle!
What are you doing up?
Oh, I always stay up in case one of you needs a cup of tea.
- How long have you been doing this?
- About three years now.
- But we never get up at night.
- Well, you're up now.
Unless I'm hallucinating from lack of sleep.
That's happened before, all right.
I'm just getting my jacket to go for a little walk.
Right so. www.opensubtitles.org subs by W-O-R-S-T

We’ve heard this little scene, we’ve heard it many times. People fighting over little things, and wasting precious time.
They might be better off I think the way it seems to me. Making up their own shows, which might be better than T.V.
Judy’s in the bedroom, inventing situations. Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations. They’ve enlisted all their family. They’ve enlisted all their friends. It helped saved their relationship, And made it work again.
Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit. There might even be a spinoff, but they’re not sure ’bout that. Just look at Bob and Judy; they’re happy as can be, Inventing situations, putting them on T.V.

"Life During Wartime"
Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway a place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance I’m getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I’ve lived all over this town
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey I ain’t got time for that now
Transmit the message, to the receiver hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, couple of visas don’t even know my real name
High on a hillside, trucks are loading everything’s ready to roll I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime I might not ever get home
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
This ain’t no mudd club, or C. B. G. B. I ain’t got time for that now

"Girlfriend is Better"
I Who took the money? Who took the money away? And
I- I-I-I, it’s always Showtime here at the edge of the stage
& I, I, I, wake up and wonder, what was the place, what was the name? We wanna wait, but here we go again.
I takes over slowly, but doesn’t last very long And
I- I-I-I, no need to worry, evr’ything’s under control
O.U.T. But no hard feelings, what do you know?
Take you away We’re being taken for a ride again
I got a girlfriend that’s better than that, she has the smoke in her eyes
She’s movin’ up, goin’ right thru my house, she’s gonna give me surprise
Better than this, know that it’s right, I think you can if you like I got a girlfriend with bows in her hair & nothin’ is better than that, is it?
Down, down in the basement, we hear the sound of machines
And I-I-I-I’m driving in circles, come to my senses sometimes
Why, why, why, why start it over? Nothing was lost, everything’s free I don’t care how impossible it seems
Somebody calls you but you cannot hear, get closer to be far away Only one look and that’s all that it takes, maybe that’s all that we need
All that it takes, all that it takes, all that it takes, all that it takes I got a girlfriend that’s better than that She goes wherever she likes
I got a girlfriend that’s better than that Now everybody’s getting involved
As we get older and stop making sense, You won’t find her waiting long
Stop making sense, stop making sense Stop making sense, making sense, I got a girlfriend that’s better than that And nothing is better that this
"Take Me to the
River"

"Crosseyed and Painless"
Lost my shape Tryin’ to act casual! Can’t stop I might end up in the hospital
Changin’ my shape I feel like an accident They’re back! To explain their experience
Isn’t it weird Sounds too obscure to me Wasting away That was their policy
I'm ready to leave I push the fact in front of me Facts lost, facts are never what they seem to be Nothing there, no information left of any kind I'm lifting my head, looking for danger signs
There was a line There was a formula
Sharp as a knife Facts cut a hole in us
I’m still waiting
I I..I’m still waiting
The feeling returns Whenever we close out eyes Lifting my head looking around inside
The island of doubt It’s like the taste of medicine Working by hindsight Got the message from the oxygen
Ooh I’m making a list Find the cost of opportunity Doing it right, right Facts are useful in emergencies
The feeling returns Whenever we close out eyes Lifting my head Looking around inside.
Facts are simple and facts are straight Facts are lazy and facts are late Facts all come with points of view Facts don’t do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around Facts are living turned inside out Facts are getting the best of them
I’m still waiting
I I..I’m still waiting
Good evening. I'm Butt-head.
The movie you are about to see will be presented using special 3D technology.
You will see the Jackasses like no human being has ever seen them before.
In three dimensions.
In order to experience this new dimension, you must put on the special glasses that you were given in the lobby.
This is gonna be cool.
Doesn't really look any different, Butt-head.
Whoa! Hey, Beavis, look at my hand.
It's in 3D.
Really? I don't see...
That's amazing!
It felt like you really hit me!
It's almost like your hand really...
Wow! It's amazing technology!
Wait a second.
So sit back and enjoy the movie.
That was definitely 2D.
Dumb-ass.
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville!
Welcome to Jackass.
My name is Johnny Knoxville, and this is the High Five.
Oh, my goodness. Good morning!
There? All right.
- Fuck.
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, Dunn. What up, brother?
- What's up, nerd?
- Whassup, dude?
- What's up, nerds?
Dude, you played it off so good.
He said, "What's up, Dunn?"
Reset, reset.
Ehren's walking in, and we're gonna have him bring in a whole tray full of soup.
- How you doing, guys?
- Pop it in there.
- He's not gonna do it.
- What?
I don't think he's gonna go for it.
- What up, Ehren?
- What's up, dude?
Help us crowd, brother.
He fell for it!
He fell for the soup!
Welcome back, ladies. You got me.
Oh, my God!
Look at the tray!
He broke it in half, dude!
- You can hug me for that.
- The tray broke.
I can't believe he fell for it.
"Can you bring the soup in?"
"We need you to bring this tray of soup into the kitchen."
This is all flour for our friend, Bam.
We're gonna antique him when he gets here.
- Oh, OK.
- He's walking in.
- What's up?
- What up?
Not much. How you been?
High five!
That was the best one so far!
- Oh, my God!
- You guys done kicked my fucking ass.
He got antiqued!
- I was so not ready for that.
- That was so good! You went flying.
- Good morning, man.
- Morning, Bam!
Howdy. Goddamn!
Not too many people knew us back in our college days, but, man, we were wild!
I mean, we were having wet T-shirt contests, bitchin' summers, body shots... cornholin'...
And Johnny Knoxville, the king of spring break!
Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga!
I'm Johnny Knoxville.
This is the Jet Ski.
Dude.
Holy shit!
You just barely clipped the top.
He totally landed it.
- How far did I go?
- You went far, man.
I was scared, man.
I've seen a lot of crazy shit during spring break, and that took the cake, man.
I didn't exactly stick the fuckin' landing.
- No. I think you did.
- Yeah, you did!
The king of spring break!
Shit. Dude, I knew we shouldn't have done this at my fuckin' dad's house.
He's already pissed about me fuckin' skipping school.
He's gonna cut me off.
That's coming out of my allowance.
I'm Steve-O... Oh, fuck!
Why do I have to be Steve-O?
- It'll be so quick.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You got it.
I'm Steve-O, and this is Tee Ball.
That was a direct ding-ding hit.
It's only getting worse and worse.
You're the best fielder
I ever saw, Steve-O.
Great job.
Right down the middle.
Line drive.
I'm Dave England, and this is the Bungee Boogie.
Go.
That was thrilling.
- What the fuck?
- Let's try it again!
Let go.
Shit!
- You OK, dude?
- Yeah, super good.
- Ready?
- OK.
My lip.
- Here we go.
- Tell us when.
- Go ahead.
- Step... go!
That was actually pretty impressive.
I mean, it wasn't a slam, but it was still pretty impressive.
But this is really impressive.
- Ready?
- This seems dangerous.
And go!
Fuck the helmet, give me a back brace.
Man, you ate shit!
- Well, that worked.
- I thought you had that.
And go!
Hey! There goes the pool!
Preston. That was awesome.
Start to see me on TV...
How many bees are we working with here today?
Each hive, probably anywhere from ten to 50,000 bees.
They are Africanized, so they will be a little bit more testy.
What do you think the chances are of these guys getting stung today?
They're gonna get stung.
There's no doubt in my mind.
When you hit a ball full of bees, you're gonna get stung.
How many bee stings do you think we can take?
I think it takes about a hundred to kill a man.
- What?!
- There's 50,000 bees in there.
Did you just make that up, please?
- I don't think I made it up.
- What?!
There's 50,000 per hive.
50,000 and it takes 100 to kill a man?
I think it's about a hundred bees can kill you, if I'm not mistaken.
- What are we doing here?
- Making a hit movie.
Go for 99 and then take off.
That's gotta piss 'em off too, right,
- just being poured in there?
- Oh, maybe.
I'm starting to think that maybe this wasn't that good of an idea.
It seemed good on paper.
Look at this.
This is gonna be gnarly now, man.
- Come on, go. Let's go.
- Whoa. No, I'm getting hit.
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, Manny.
Go on! Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Fucking do it!
Got a butt-ton of bees!
My two sexy players, this is Beehive Tetherball! Game on!
Game on!
Oh, fucking shit!
I can't do it anymore!
Shit! Fuck! Goddamn it!
Fuck! Oh, shit!
He's gonna win!
- Steve-O!
- Fuck!
- Shit! Oh, fuck!
- Stay with Dave. Go with Dave.
Loomis, come retrieve the ball.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, dude, it fucking hurts!
Oh, my God! Oh, fuck!
Please put me somewhere where there's no bees!
It's the carbon dioxide.
Your body heated up, so they targeted you, you took it really good, man.
I am so fucking hurt!
You were running around on carbon dioxide.
- Look at your eye.
- God, I gotta get rid of this.
The thing is that Dave doesn't understand is that the more you freak out, the more you get stung.
Idiot!
That felt like somebody was blowing a fireball in my face.
It looked like you were just getting the hell beat out of you.
You can't fucking breathe.
Waiter? Can I get some cream for my coffee?
That's the story of Jackass right there.
Just pissing in the wind.
Hey, buddy, would you mind watching my dog for a second while I run in there?
Thanks. I'll be right back.
Thank you, buddy.
Thanks, bud.
Thank you very much for watching my dog.
My name is Johnny Knoxville, and this is Roller Buffalo.
You're the man!
We're not worthy.
Oh, man. Let me get over here.
- What'd it feel like?
- It felt like shit.
It felt like I got run over by a buffalo.
It's in my mouth!
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!
Ehren, stay here!
Think we need to get him out from there?!
Let's get him!
Get it off of him.
- Ehren, stay out!
- All right!
Lance... Hold it together, Lance!
Pull out! OK, pull out! Pull out!
- Did I get the shot?
- You got the shot, dude.
So it went high and everything?
It was like a volcano?
You got a good three feet.
- Three foot?
- Yeah, that one had some power.
- It was like a full-on volcano?
- Absolutely.
Don't say anything.
- What would your flavors be?
- Two Budweisers.
What do I owe you?
Six-fifty, please.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, dear.
- Cheers. Boop!
- Cheers.
So what's the status?
I don't know. Go down to the beach or something... hit the water.
You tried it?
Tara! What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck?!
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who are you?
I'm her frickin' boyfriend, asshole!
That's cool, bud. I'm her man-friend.
Dude, don't push me. Don't push me.
I'm not even touching you.
You know, fuck both of you!
Fuck both of you!
Calm down now.
So...
He and I are taking a break and...
Right in here.
Right in here.
Fuck you! I told you to get the fuck away!
- Don't push him, man!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
Get your ass down!
Keep your punk ass down, you hunk of shit!
Get him, Pop! Get him, Poppy!
Get his ass down!
Get off of him! Stop!
Police! Get on the fucking ground!
Get on the ground!
Freeze! Everybody up against the wall!
- Up against the wall!
- Get the fuck off me!
What the fuck are you doing?!
Get him up. Get him up!
Freeze, motherfucker!
Get your hands behind your back!
- Let's go, babe!
- Fucking get off me!
Code 54! Paramedic! Paramedic!
Get the fuck off me!
Get him off me!
- Get the fuck off me!
- Shut up! Shut up!
Look at them two.
Big boy. Wait. He can walk?
OK.
What was that all that about?
What the hell was all that about?
I don't know! A bunch of midgets come in here and start fighting!
- I don't know what happened.
- That was wild!
The cops came in!
I can't believe it.
Little miniature cops.
Here comes Dunn.
No fucking way, dude!
- Oh, my God.
- Is there blue on me?
I am so happy.
- There's a lot of blue.
- Dude, that thing goes!
Fuck!
Dude, the sound of it is just fucking terrifying.
This sucks. Oh, man.
Its bark is worse than its bite, Ehren.
Due to prison overpopulation, we're gonna give these boys here a chance to escape.
This side represents incarceration, that side, freedom.
This is Electric Avenue.
Each one of these stun guns has 950,000 volts.
There's 15 of 'em hanging here, plus four cattle prods. Good luck, fellas!
Go!
- Go, go, go!
- Fuck!
Fuck, I'm gonna pass out, man.
I'm gonna fucking pass out.
Come on, come on.
Go, go, go!
Fuck, that sucked!
Fuck!
Sucks doody!
- How do you feel?
- I changed my mind.
Stun guns are the number one most thing that I hate now.
Bulls are second, snakes are third.
That sucked! Terribly.
I'm Preston Lacy here with pro kicker Josh Brown, and this is the Field Goal.
Kick!
Wow, that was a good kick.
- Was that right in the puss?
- Right on the kisser.
Oh, fuck.
My mouth.
Fuck!
- I love you, buddy. Thank you.
- Oh, my God.
Pro football star Josh Brown.
I love you, buddy. Right here.
Fucking A!
- On the mouth.
- You're a man.
April, what kind of glue is this?
- Super Mighty Glue.
- This is Super Mighty Glue, and we're going to have a little fun with it today.
Who's got tummy hair?
Not me.
- You have tummy hair?
- I have a fraction.
- That's definitely tummy hair.
- That's tummy hair.
- You guys got tummy hair.
- Now we're talking.
Looks like we got cast for this bit.
- Don't get it on his fingers.
- You don't need a lot, they say.
A dab'll do ya.
Oh, Knoxville, Jesus!
No, I think this is gonna work.
All right. We ready?
Ready, then?
Oh, my God!
Now. Oh, my God!
Keep it on there. Keep it on.
Keep it on there.
Dude, it's gonna take my skin off.
You're gonna have hairy palms.
Wait. I kind of like it when Preston says...
Fuck!
- It's not moving.
- What do you like Preston to say?
Get a little symphony going.
Dude, this is in.
Should they pull it?
We don't need any more time, dude.
It is in.
You got at least 15 grams of super glue.
- Pull it! Pull it!
- Really?
- Three, two, one...
- Skin's coming, I know it. Go, Bam!
He's a werewolf!
Werewolf!
That is mingin'-ass Phil's.
Preston's is pretty gross, but that is disgusting!
Wow!
No, don't pour that on your boo-boo hand.
- It stings.
- That's gotta hurt.
Hey, Dunn. Do you have any hair on your butt?
- No.
- Do you want some?
I'm thinking I'm about due for a hairy ass, yeah.
I'm in my 30s, it hasn't grown in natural yet.
So I think we're gonna have to do a transplant.
Phil, can I borrow some of your back hair?
Yeah, like having you sit on my back?
I'm thinking about becoming a real man.
Sure, I'll lay down and you can sit on it.
- OK, Rake.
- You ready to go? Let's do it.
Ryan, do you shave your ass?
Shave my... Look at me!
Do I shave my ass?
I don't know what a razor feels like.
Apparently, you don't know what toilet paper feels like either.
- I don't!
- Make sure it's clean.
All right, go, go, go!
You gotta sit!
- Sit! Sit! Sit!
- Sit down.
Time it, two minutes on the clock.
- Phil, you all right down there?
- Yeah.
- Consider this a bonding experience.
- Okay.
You got about 30 seconds.
Well, if I can't get
Phil's hair off of me, then, you know, I'd really rather prefer a ZZ Top beard.
Fucking asshole!
You dickhead!
- That's not gonna come off.
- No fucking shit!
That's not gonna come off.
It's going to come off.
It's going to come off.
You fucking, fucking pricks.
- Okay, Dunn, stand up.
- Dunn, you're up. Stand up.
Let's see if you got some hair on your butt.
- Ready? Go.
- One, two...
- What the hell?
- Your butt looks 80 years old.
- Does it?
- Somebody should iron you.
- Look at Phil's back.
- Let me see.
Man, you're missing a lot of hair in there.
But no doo-doo stains, right?
- No.
- Not so much.
All right, good.
Why'd you grip it like that?
Why you biting off of Preston's steez by going?
Wait a minute, hold those scissors down.
Oh, you son of a bitch.
I have a free hand.
Hello!
- Here, I'll be like this to catch him.
- All right, you catch him.
Ryan, do you want your pants up, first?
Catch me. Catch Knox.
- Grab Bam.
- No, keep your pants down.
- I don't want my balls hanging out.
- Ready then? Three...
Man, this is gonna suck.
Three, two, go.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Fuck me, man.
What a bunch of dicks.
That's worse than Phil.
All right.
Wee Man, what are you doing?
You take the cake, bub.
You won't come out that easy.
Why don't you want to glue
Wee Man to Preston?
- Yes.
- I should lay down, and you should lay down on top of me.
- Woof.
- Going right for it.
Like this?
- I think like this.
- No.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- A 69.
- Glued into 69.
I think that's the best way.
Well, fucking lube him up or lube me up!
- Let's go!
- Where's the glue?
- That's good.
- OK, OK, OK!
- Knoxville!
- Sorry.
Asshole!
We're really bros now.
You should see it from where I'm at.
Oh, no.
Hold it. Two minutes!
Someone time it.
Two minutes is the longest
69 I've ever fuckin' done!
- How do you plan on un-69-ing?
- I have no fucking idea.
- I got an idea how to get him off.
- Slide them down the table, this way.
- No!
- What?
No, don't... Nicely.
Somebody go get me the stun gun.
No!
Yeah! Go get it! Get the stun gun!
I'm pulling off!
I'm pulling off! No! No! No!
That's not fucking cool! No, no!
Fuck!
Look at my fucking nipple!
My fucking armpit kills!
Phil, pull it off.
- For real? Where, here?
- What's this from?
I can't. Let Ap do it.
- Yank it off.
- Ready, ready, ready...
Stop that.
I think that's it for Super Mighty Glue.
I think that's it for Super Mighty Glue.
Thank God none of us had that foreskin you were talking about.
Does anyone have foreskin?
Anybody. Now's the time to raise your hand.
Yeah.
Three, two, one, go!
Chicas.
Sorry. I hit my wrong button.
Give me my leg! Help!
Give me my leg!
That mutt's got my leg! Stop! Thief!
- Hey!
- Where you going?
Oh, God.
I went to the bathroom.
I have to change.
Run, run, run run, run, run, run!
Run, run, run, run, run!
Hey, man.
What are you doing, man?
I messed myself. I messed myself.
- Can you help me?
- Hell, no. You going to clean it?
I'm cleaning it!
If you'll get off my case.
Hello. My name is Irving Zisman.
This is my grandson, Murray, and today, we're going to go buy a scooter.
Wow, what a lovely place.
Good selection.
- How you doing, sir?
- Good. I'm with my grandson.
- Oh, very nice.
- Yeah.
- How much does this cost?
- That's running about $2,000.
Two thousand?
What'd I do, break something?
My goodness.
What were you looking at over there, Murray?
Just a couple of bikes down there.
Tell me a little bit about this one here.
This is nice. I'll put it back.
- I'll be right back.
- OK.
Holy shit!
Fuck. Did I hit the wrong button?
What happened? Are you OK?
Sir, would you like me to call the paramedics?
No, I'm fine!
- What happened?
- The old dude just took off.
Some guy just fuckin' went through the thing.
How'd he come through here?
He came through here?
He went out that way.
How'd he go out that way?
I think he's all right.
Oh, my goodness.
Up yours!
I'm Pontius the Barbarian, and now the day has come to slay the foul beast, the devil's brethren.
Come, beast. Come meet your doom.
Oh, you sour beast!
You swine of the darkness!
I've long awaited this blood orgy, you...
Fool! More!
Fool! He's got me!
Fuck! Goddamn it, get me out of here!
Fuck!
Dude, fuck this shit.
- What happened?
- I'm fucking over it.
- It got you good right here.
- I know, it got me good a lot.
You got bit and stung, so mission accomplished.
I'm fucking pissed.
What'd you think was going to happen?
Up a little. Yeah, right there.
Oh, shit.
We're here with BMX legend
Mat Hoffman, and this is a Sweatsuit Cocktail.
So I guess the idea is for the sweat to dribble down into the funnel, into the cup.
That's rinky-dink, even for us.
That's coming right out of the ass.
We probably need a doctor.
You almost have a drop.
Man, it's fucking hot in this!
Steve-O, face.
- What's that?
- Face.
Looks like white gravy.
Sop his face.
Bring the cup down a little bit.
- Get it, get it!
- Oh, shit!
- Is that pee-pee or sweat?
- It's sweat, dude. Get it!
Wring that out, Steve-O.
We're losing Lance, guys.
What?
What is? His head's bobbing.
Lance, you all right?
I think we just broke him again.
You OK?
- You need the camera?
- Yeah...
- The camera help you not get sick?
- Yeah, I'm...
All right, give him the camera so he...
Got it? You good?
Hey, someone follow me down the crack.
OK, here we go.
Steve-O! Steve-O! Lord!
Sorry! Sorry.
A prostate exam going on back there.
Fuck sake, dude.
Here, let's take this shit off and wring out the suit.
That makes me want to puke.
This is the first cocktail you've had in two years, right?
Yeah. Here's to good health.
Chug that whole thing, Steve-O.
I think the cam...
Don't puke on that heater.
You're puking on...
Give me your camera.
You're puking right on your lens.
Here, we gotta like...
We're really falling apart here.
- Jesus.
- I love you, bro.
He just puked all over his camera.
That was the Sweatsuit Cocktail.
- Seriously.
- Yeah, brother.
My name is Santy Claus, and I'm here with the Dudesons, and this is the Christmas Tree.
Timber!
- Santa and elf is coming down hard.
- Yes!
Santa ain't climbed a tree in quite a while.
And, I am gonna be honest,
Santa did have a couple last night.
So... this ain't gonna feel too good.
I'm just here to enjoy the ride.
How do you get started?
- You need a hand?
- F, yes! Santa needs a hand.
I just love that they're climbing up a 40-foot tree, and they're gonna have a 60-foot drop and it's
- the top of the morning.
- Top of the morning to you!
- Santa looking good!
- Santa's fucking tired.
Santa can barely hold on, so let's go.
That was the hard part!
Now comes the easy part.
Bring out the saw!
They're letting Jarppi work the chainsaw.
He's never touched a chainsaw before.
He's got one thumb.
How's he gonna hit the trigger?
He's gonna have no thumbs after this.
You ever get scared in these moments?
Yeah.
Push it! Push it the other way!
Jarppi, cut out!
Yeah, but you got to push!
There it goes, there it goes!
Timber!
Fuck!
Santa's coming out!
Are you all right?
I fell on the tree... on my ass!
- You fell on the tree?
- Yeah.
But you're alive.
You good?
Santa, I think that's the only proper way to get yourself a Christmas tree.
With all that sleigh riding I do,
Santa really doesn't like heights,
I found out.
I'm Danger Ehren, and this is Pin the Tail on the Donkey.
You got it.
Let me spin you around.
Spin you around.
OK. Spread your legs.
Tail up higher.
- Where'd he hit you?
- It didn't.
Where the fuck do you think it hit me?
Look, damn it!
Put that tail on that donkey.
OK, it's just a donkey.
Spread legs... spread legs.
That's good.
Get your dick lower.
You're going good. Spread legs.
Your walk is just amazing.
Straight, straight.
You're getting warm.
I heard that.
It got me in the dick!
It got me in the dick!
I see the hoofprint on his ding-ding.
Fuck! I don't want to do that anymore, if that's OK.
Hello...
Hello. My name is Johnny Knoxville.
We have professional football players Erik Ainge, Jared Allen, and our referee today,
Seann William Scott.
This is the Blindside.
- I didn't do it, Wee Man.
- I know.
I didn't do it.
Jared, why did you do that?
I really got lost in the moment.
Let's get this shit over with.
Blue... 24!
Blue... 24! Hut!
Oh, my God.
Looks like you didn't block him, Preston.
You just planted me in the fucking ground!
That felt like shit.
Have you ever played linebacker before?
- Years and years ago.
- You think you can give it a try?
Quickly review. What's your job?
Murder Knoxville's face.
- What's your job?
- Catch the ball.
- I mean...
- Let's do this!
I mean, catch the ball.
Do you think Knoxville's gonna catch the ball?
- Nope.
- Who gives a shit?
Hey, Jared! Don't hit me with your purse this time!
Nice wristband, douche.
Ten hut!
Did I catch it?
People don't realize football's a game of physics.
Speed and velocity equals that.
- Good game. See you in the showers.
- Good game. See you in the showers.
Oh, fuck!
That was perfect. That was perfect.
This is our friend, Will, and he has a very special bottom.
Dude, you are one mingin' machine.
You ready? All right, come on, dude, let's party.
- What about the trumpet?
- All right. Here he goes.
You're bringing jazz back to the working man.
- We're on to something here.
- That's talent!
Hey, bud, dude, can I bum a smoke?
Wait.
Bottoms up.
There's shit on the end...
Is there shit on the end?
- There's shit on there.
- Hey, look at this shit.
I saw it.
- That's fucking gross.
- Dude, that was fucking mingin'.
Let's get out the dart gun.
- Yeah.
- There you go.
Luckily, we had it handy.
- Do you want to practice?
- Let's get a balloon.
- Does it need to go down lower?
- Yeah, go lower.
You got it. You got it.
You might want to tuck your nuts up.
No, no, no! I think you should leave your legs just a little agape.
Steve-O, don't get your balls in the way. You'll hurt 'em.
- Is this sucking in?
- Yeah, he's sucking in.
- Trippin' out.
- I'm seriously trippin'.
You wanna try the longer... Hey!
My name's Johnny Knoxville and this is Bad Dog.
Oklahoma! Oklahoma!
Fuck!
Oh, my ass meat!
That dog... is athletic.
My ass hurts.
Lance, can you tell
I've been doing squats?
You know, I couldn't have done this on the first... two movies, because
I never really did squats or anything then, but now I've been really working out my butt and legs, and it gave the dog something to bite on.
Pretty good something to bite on, if you ask me.
Yeah.
I'm Chris Pontius, and this is the Helicockter.
Oh, no, you're flying it.
Yeah!
- Throttle back, throttle back!
- Throttle back!
Throttle back. Throttle back.
Oh, God!
Well, so much for my aviation career.
Oh, God. So much for my love life.
Yo, Novak.
- Oh, my God!
- Holy fuck!
Oh, my God!
- Are you all right?
- Oh, my God!
Dude, you have no idea how fucking perfect that was.
Help me up. No, not that way.
Dude, we gotta see that shit.
Dude, it hit so fucking hard, my face...
- That's the brake.
- Look at the weld.
- I've had stronger silverware.
- How fast does it go?
It's kind of fast for being as cruddy as they are.
- So you're saying he might make it.
- He'll definitely make it.
- Dude, you got this.
- Nothing.
Nothing.
What's the furthest you've jumped a motorcycle before?
I haven't jumped a motorcycle.
- So this will be your record.
- Yeah. I'm breaking records.
I'm doing the Snake River
Redemption and, hopefully, if all goes as planned,
I will create a perfect rainbow, ending up in Wee Man's pot of gold.
Or on Wee Man.
- Either way.
- Either way works.
The proud owner of Wee Man's Chronic Tacos!
At least your run-up ramp looks like a piece of microwave bacon.
Uphill!
A very patriotic, microwave bacon.
Just aim for the fucking leprechaun.
I'm gonna try and take out the leprechaun.
- Land in the gold.
- Steal his gold.
Whatever. Let's fucking get it over with and go have some fucking tacos!
Shit!
- Fuck yeah!
- You all right?
You OK?
We got a Dunn down!
You done good!
That was fucking awesome.
That was awesome, Dunn!
Dude, that thing is squirrelly as shit!
That was so amazing!
I think it's time for a Wee Man's Chronic Taco replay.
Redemption is made!
I'm Preston Lacy, and this is the Apple of My Ass.
- Want me to put it in, P?
- Put her in.
Help me out, O.
- What about the apple?
- I got it.
- Is it in there pretty good?
- I think so. I think so.
- A little deeper.
- I can make it fit way better.
- A little deeper.
- What?
- Hold it open, I'll put it in.
- There we go. That's in good.
- Oh, Steve-O.
- My balls.
Hold on.
You don't like apple and peanut butter?
- Bring in Bob.
- Come on, Bob!
Oh, don't bring in Bob.
- Come on, Bob.
- Oh, my God.
- Make him work for it.
- Come on, Bob.
- Poor Bob.
- Come on, Bob.
- Get it, Bob.
- He smells.
Come on, Bobby. Bob-Bob. Bob-Bob.
- The old forbidden fruit.
- Come on, Bob.
- The Garden of Eatin'.
- Come on, Bob!
Grip it, grip it.
Bob.
He really got in there.
Oh, he's going back for more.
Don't move.
He's going back for more.
Good, baby.
Put it back in there? OK.
- Is that Bob?
- Oh, man.
It's in there!
It's still in there!
Get back down there!
Get back down. It's still in.
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
- Can I move this?
- Still have an apple in your ass?
Got it out.
Why did you do that, Jeff?
See, Bob? I told you it's not that hard to get into a movie.
- You got it?
- Oh, no!
I was checking out my new haircut in the mirror.
I was talking to Wee Man over there, then I heard a...
I'm like, "What was that?"
"I know what that was."
Kinda hurt my nose.
It's like way, way up in my brain.
Me and the boys are about to do a little Duck Hunting.
- Pull!
- Oh, shit!
You guys all right?
- What did Andy do?
- He got fucked up.
- Our timing was off.
- I don't know. When we jumped, somehow I got under him, he got on top of me, and he landed on me.
His head smashed me.
- I'm shaking.
- It hurt so bad.
- Got hit too.
- That looked hilarious.
Now it's Parks's turn, and this duck's got a little more meat on him.
Pull!
We lit him the fuck up.
Oh, my God!
I got welted.
It's like fuckin' falling into a bees'nest.
- Holy crap!
- We killed Quack Quack.
- My whole back stings.
- Does it?
Yeah, ten, 11 right there, and that one.
All right. So let's reload.
Get Dunn on there.
Looks like Dunn's up next.
Ready, C-sucker?
This one's a gobbler for sure.
Pull!
Good fucking God!
I gotta give it to Paul Bunyan's
40-foot fucking cartwheel.
You look like Buck Rogers going through time, you know.
Yeah, I felt like I was in the air for a fortnight.
Oh, my God.
Jump out!
I told you
I was gonna fucking clear it.
That fucking just happened, didn't it?
Hello. My name is Irving Zisman.
This is my wife and granddaughter, and today I'm a Really Bad Grandpa.
No, you're not, Grandpa.
You're the best.
- Irving!
- Sorry, baby.
Sorry.
Sorry, man, sorry.
Excuse me, homeboy, can you take our picture?
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- No problem.
I'm so...
Sorry. Thank you, buddy. OK?
- You know what? I'm gonna pass.
- You just hit the button there.
I'm going to pass on that.
Are you underage?
No. This is my granddaughter.
She's of age. She's 19.
Sir, you shouldn't be kissing your granddaughter, slapping your granddaughter's ass like that, sir.
- She's of age.
- You can go to jail for that.
I don't... I'm trying.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You shouldn't be doing that to your granddaughter.
- What are you doing?
- Honey, I don't even know this man.
I don't care. You're with your granddaughter. That's terrible!
- I've never seen anything like it...
- This is my wife.
- This is your wife?
- Yes. Honey, I'm sorry.
Don't bother coming home tonight!
OK? Don't bother.
Honey! God. Jesus.
- Why would you?
- Go talk to her.
Excuse me. I have my own problems.
Honey!
It's time to find out if music calms the wild beast.
I'm Ryan Dunn, and this is the Ram Jam.
Soothing?
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
He's already looking at me.
Can you just go over there until
I get in here, buddy? Jesus.
You better hurry up.
He's looking at me.
- He looks beguiled.
- He's like, "Are these guys stupid?"
- He doesn't like what he sees, though.
- Hey, little baby.
That was good.
- Play some music! Play some music!
- You're toast.
- Steve-O, help him!
- Play some music!
Steve-O, help him!
Get it over here, Dunn!
Go help him, Steve-O!
- Save your bro!
- Help him, Steve-O!
- Play!
- Steve-O!
Play the trumpet!
- Yeah, there you go.
- Just you, Steve-O.
Maybe we used the wrong instruments.
So you think music calmed the wild beast?
Not at all, man, not at all.
I don't think so, either.
Here we go.
You guys look like idiots.
Ready?
Fore!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Did you take it in the neck?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God, dude!
You took it in the Adam's apple.
- Hi, Spike.
- Ehren McGhehey. Travis Bickle.
- He's got a tooth that we need out.
- I need it out.
I need it because you need it.
Whatever you need, I need.
- Let's get it out.
- We need it together.
You wanna walk the walk, you gotta talk the talk, or no one will take you seriously.
Dr. Pontius? Dr. Dunn?
- Can we do this?
- Finally!
Tie him up and let's do it.
Sit down.
Relax.
- Take it easy.
- Relax.
You know why this happened.
Flossing is just as important as brushing.
So what we're going to do is extract Ehren's crooked tooth and then we're gonna replant it, just like you would a tree.
- But straight.
- But straight.
I'm Danger Ehren, and this is the Lamborghini Tooth Pull.
Here's the good news:
What you're doing is stupid.
So you got that going.
Get in the Lambo, shitbird!
This is gonna suck.
Did your barber tell you to do this?
He seems like he's full of bad ideas.
Are you stoked?
It's a Lamborghini.
Listen to that thing.
- Open your eyes wide.
- Look at that bad-ass Lamborghini.
Yeah!
God!
- Way to go!
- Fuckin' deuce!
Victory.
I wish I could say that didn't suck.
- Oh, my God!
- You look terrible!
Is it gone? Is it gone? It hurt!
- Oh, my God!
- You did good.
You did good. You did good.
Man, that hurt me. Not really.
Let me see, Ehren.
- What'd it feel like?
- It hurt like a...
- What was that?
- I don't know.
- What... Are you crying?
- You're pulling my tooth.
We already pulled your tooth.
We're not "pulling" your tooth.
We already pulled your tooth.
We're not "pulling" your tooth.
The tooth is officially pulled.
Ehren, remember how I said
I could replant the tooth?
- Yeah.
- That story wasn't true.
I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.
- It was a story.
We were trying to build up your confidence.
That hurts.
A lot of doctors... dentists...
I don't really consider them real doctors.
They think they're God, you know? Not me.
Satan.
Yeah, he's soaked.
You fucking...
How much piss do you have?!
Dudes, I'm telling you,
I drank a dozen of them things.
All I got to say is,
Tremaine told me to do this.
Ap and Phil just arrived in Los Angeles.
As soon as they check in their hotel room, there's gonna be a gorilla in there, aka Chris Pontius, and the trainer here, Will, who's gonna try to tame him but it's gonna go horribly wrong.
Basically, all hell's gonna break loose.
It's gonna be a blood orgy.
My goodness.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
No, no, no, no!
It's OK! This is Samson.
Just don't make eye contact.
Samson, down. Be quiet.
He's a good boy. If he wants to be a good boy, he's a good boy.
Just don't make any sudden movements.
Don't make eye contact with him. Samson...
I'm getting my whip!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Get out of here!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Get out of here!
Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Samson!
- Jesus Christ. What the hell was that?
- There's a trainer...
- It's out! It's out!
What happened to Phil?
- The trainer will get him.
- He said be quiet.
Sam, Sam...
Oh, my God.
I never saw a gorilla before.
- He's tame.
- He just wrecked the whole room.
- There's a fucking trainer.
- Big deal!
- Did this go wrong or something?
- Kind of.
What was supposed to happen?
- He's like the trainer...
- Oh, so what?
He seems all right now.
Was this supposed to be just fun or something?
He wants to go back in the room.
Do you have the key to that room?
- Yeah.
- Give me the key.
- Give me the key.
- My husband's in there somewhere.
Is Phil OK? Is Phil out here?
- I shit myself!
- What? Where is he?
- I had to take a mean shit.
- There's a gorilla.
I know. I had to take a mean shit.
It was coming out.
Hear it? It's all juicy. I had to do it.
- Phil, you are mingin'.
- I know. I had to.
I need this thing off.
I can't breathe. I need this off.
Is that a person?
That's a frickin' person.
- It's Pontius, dipshit!
- Is that a person?
Is that a...
Oh, my God! I can't believe it!
Did you almost have a heart attack?
Oh, my God.
- I'm so glad you're fake.
- Welcome to L.A.
Phil's in there shittin'.
- Get...
- It scared the shit out of Phil.
All right.
- That's a good one.
- Get it! Go! Go!
Holy shit!
Hello, my name is Johnny Knoxville, and today I'm an Invisible Man.
You ready?
OK.
Take him around again.
Am I still invisible?
I hate when they do that.
Fuck me.
Where'd Knoxville go?
He's up ahead.
Is he close? Oh, fuck!
Open the gate!
That was fucking insane.
- No, he landed bad.
- He really fell a little bit there.
- Oh, Jesus.
- You OK, Johnny?
Dude, that was a total neck-breaker.
I think it jarred his head.
- Get the money shot?
- Oh, yeah, dude.
Look at the feet mark on top of the tree.
Yeah, look it...
- I got ups. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, you did.
- You were over the rainbow.
- I was over the rainbow.
So, in this trailer, we have a false floor with an 11-foot-deep pit we dug and filled with rubber snakes.
And Bam thinks he's gonna be doing a prank on Jeff, who's sitting in front of the trailer.
But he's gonna be falling into that pit, and when he does,
Mr. David Weathers... has a few hundred live snakes we're gonna throw in there with him.
Bam really hates snakes, too.
This may be the first time
Bam cries in the film.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- You want to?
Tremaine's in a very vulnerable spot.
I think it's time for Rocky.
I think it's Rocky 4, I believe.
Either way, he's getting punched in the face.
Be quiet.
Oh, fuck!
Fucking fuck.
No!
Are they real?
Get me the fuck out of here.
You cocksuckers.
Dude, get me out, man.
- They're not real, dude.
- What happened?
- I want out, man.
- Bam. Bam.
What, what?! Don't do this to me!
Yo, seriously, get me out!
Get me the fuck out now!
Now! Get me out now!
Dude, stop, stop, stop!
Oh, Jesus.
I'm stepping back for this one.
Dude, stop fucking with me!
- Hey, Bam.
- Dude, I fucking hate you guys.
- Dimitry, please! Please!
- Is he crying?
- Please! Please!
- He's really crying.
Tremaine, you motherfucker!
Get me out now!
It's not funny. It's not funny!
It's not funny? I'm gonna argue with you on that one, Bam.
You fucking assholes!
- Get him out.
- Get me out.
Get me out.
You can't do that to me, man.
Sorry, bud.
Dude, that is the worst fear
I could ever imagine.
You fucking, dick-sucking, fucking, asshole motherfuckers just did that to me.
Look at the snake tracks on his back.
You have snake marks on your back.
- Oh, my God.
- That one is so big!
That looks like hell in there.
That was fucking terrifying. I can't think of anything more terrifying than that, that just happened right now.
Well, you're welcome, man.
Fucking cocksucker.
Your voice definitely did have different nuances to it when you were hollering out for... getting out of there.
Stop it, man!
Fuck, man! You're gonna make me have heart... Seriously...
Thank God I'm leaving at three today.
I am counting down the minutes.
Seriously. With fucking
David Weathers around.
I'm gonna see if there's a one-hour-earlier flight.
Most people don't like the idea of being covered in dog shit, but that doesn't bother me nearly as much as, like, rollercoasters and bungee jumping.
I just can't do that shit, man.
That's why this is gonna be fantastic.
It's basically like a poo coaster.
- You have really irrational fears.
- I know.
"Cast me out to sea with sharks,
I don't care."
"Put a hook through my cheek.
But I'm not bungee diving."
What the fuck?
Oh, my God.
Come here, dude.
I'm trying.
- What's the problem?
- It fuckin' stinks like sh... shit.
I think it's about ten years ago today that I was doing the first Poo Cocktail and now you're taking the reins and taking it to a whole other level.
- Yep.
- You look pretty happy about it.
Hey, let's get me down pretty fucking quick after this.
I'm gonna be so claustrophobic, it's gonna be ridiculous.
- Do you have claustrophobia?
- Yeah.
Just relax and enjoy your shit.
I'm Steve-O, and this is the Poo Cocktail Supreme.
All right. Good luck.
- You ready, Steve-O?
- No.
Order up! Poo Cocktail Supreme!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
He's puking!
Fucking gross.
What's wrong with you, Bam?
Oh, my God, dude.
Are you OK, Steve-O?
Oh, my God!
It's gonna be ugly. I don't know if you wanna see this.
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus.
- Help him out of there!
- Let him out!
I'm ready...
Oh, my God.
Jump in that lake right now.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Jesus!
Oh, God, it's so gross.
This is the kind of extreme shit that those extreme dudes don't even think of.
That had it all.
That had danger. It had shit.
It had puke. That's what this show is all about.
And sex appeal.
All right, fellas, we're gonna play a little game called
Escaped Convict and Warden's Wife.
And I'm pretty sure something sucky's gonna happen when I push this.
So would you guys rather listen to Steve-O's rap album,
- or have me push this plunger?
- Push the plunger!
All right, let's end this turkey.
Glasses on! Goggles on!
Hello. My name's Johnny Knoxville and I'm about to end this movie.
What?
Oh, my God! I don't believe...
Can you believe this?
I don't understand what the hell they're doing.
I mean, it looks more like a riptide to me. Don't you think so?
This is ridiculous.
Now wait just a second.
- How? Is this the way you make...
- Rip Taylor!
Shut up yourself! I'm just fed up.
Who's the fat guy in the Speedo?
Look in the mirr... Oh, my God.
Look in the mirror. A grown man.
And they did it.
And I can't believe all the confetti.
And don't forget... Jackass 3D.
- 3D!
- Thank you.
No tongue! No tongue!
No tongue!
No tongue!
I'm Danger Ehren, and that was the Lamborghini Tooth Pull.
- We're not using that.
- I don't care.
Now we are using that.
Dude!
I was joking. You just broke Jeff's cam... You broke your camera.
Fucker!
Fuck, OK, you got me, dude.
Bro-zilian, take two, mark.
Dude! Dude! Cut the...
Dude, I will fucking punch you in the face, dude! Stop it.
Whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, don't be a sissy.
Three, two, one, go!
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to Jackass.
Cut!
My name is Eddie Barbanell, and this is some bullshit with a plunger.
Preston, move your ass.
Come back here!
This bruise looks old.
Yeah, there's been a lot of stuff going on back there.
That's an official break.
Jeez. That's so gnarly.
That's some serious bragging rights, right there.
Happy birthday!
Thanks.
Oh, right there. That's the spot.
Sorry. Had we known you didn't like red, we wouldn't have wore this.
Thanks, buddy.
He's got it, he's got it! Oh, shit!
Man, you jumped!
Oh, you fucker. You fucker.
I did it like you said.
I held the brake...
Like this, while it's still...
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!
Yeah!
That's my girl.
- You're gonna roller-skate.
- Yeah, I'm an awesome roller skater.
I know. I saw you a long time ago at the L.A. River when you were...
- Why you gotta bring that up?
- You were amazing!
My name is Johnny Knoxville, and today,
I'm gonna jump the L.A. River.
Help me! Help me!
How's it going? I'm Steve-O, and I collected nine days of elephant shit.
No wait, that doesn't work.
What should I say?
Say whatever you want.
- Hi. I'm Jeff.
- Hi. I'm April.
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi, April. Nice meeting you.
Look at these haggard tattoos he has!
He's got a Chili Peppers sign.
And what's this? Blair Witch?
- What's this one over here?
- That's a noose.
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
That's Trip.
- And action.
- Hi. Welcome to Jackass.
I never wanted to be this.
I was hired to move the ramps,
'cause I was the only one with a pickup truck.
Do it up and down.
You! Pull that fucking camera back, jackass.
I know Johnny Knoxville, and he is not broadcasting my crack to millions of people.
Is this shoot over?
Yeah. What did you want out of it?
You got whatever, you know?
You did great today, Jeff.

We've had some problem with Kerrey people ripping down our signs... but we're gonna take care of that.
- [Onlookers Laughing]
- Um, other than —
- [Man] They're gonna ask them not to.
- Yeah.
We also have a schizophrenic newspaper which, like... prints every shit possible on the front page and then apologizes in the editorial.
It's really bizarre.
The Tsongas sign on Route 3 lasted all of two days.
- It's gone now.
- [Laughter]
[Man] Those Harkin people are stealin' everyone's signs. It's amazing.
Short of, uh, calling for negative ads — although maybe — is there any effort underfoot to go after Tsongas?
Let's face it.
This guy cannot be squeaky clean.
[Man] Sure. Well, this is the question about that, and let's throw that out here.
The problem with attacking Senator Tsongas is —
I mean, we jokingly call him St. Paul.
It could really backfire against us to someone else's advantage.
- Absolutely.
- Um, and that's been —

[Man] And it'll look bad, because he's complimented him all along.
And then to come the last week and say that he's bad — I think it will look bad.
We have to do a better job of saying our differences.
We always seem to be defending.
We don't have to defend a damn thing.
We got the best — We know he's the best candidate, 'cause we've met him.
And if everybody in the state of New Hampshire met him... we wouldn't have a problem — we know that.
Thank you.
I'm glad to be with you.
I wasn't in the leather jacket group, but, uh... you know, I had a good time.
But I was a pretty straight kid.
I worked hard enough to make good grades... but I basically liked my music and my friends... and I had a heck of a good time when I was in high school.
We had a band in high school called
The Three Kings. I've still got a record.
You bet.
Thank you.

"Clinton's is James Carville, a Cajun who wears jeans with bright shirts.
Brown's is a Frenchman named Jacques Barzhagi... who wears jeans with a black leather jacket and black beret, indoors and out.
Carville says of Brown,

Barzhagi says cryptically,
'Let them spin. We will win."'

Good afternoon.
This whole experience is not easy for me.
Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years... and for the past two years I have lied to the press about our relationship to protect him.
The truth is, I loved him.
Now he tells me to deny it.
Well, I'm sick of all of the deceit... and I'm sick of all of the lies.
- [Camera Shutters Clicking]
- [Reporters Chattering]
It's that way.
[Female Reporter] Mr. Clinton, what's your relationship with Gennifer Flowers?
There really isn't one, obviously.
[Chuckles]
I mean, the charges are false.
The, uh — Today she took money to publish a story... that she hired a lawyer to say was absolutely defamatory over a year ago.
And, uh, it's sad.
It's sad that this sort of thing could be published... in a newspaper like the Star which says Martians walk on the earth.
You'd never ask me if Martians walk on the earth.
[Male Reporter]
Will you comment on the tapes she has?
No. I can't. I haven't heard 'em.

The reason I was calling was to tell you... that this last Wednesday, someone got into my apartment.
- [Man On Tape] Hold on a minute.
- [Flowers] Okay.
- [Man] So somebody broke in your apartment?
- [Flowers] Well, yeah.
There wasn't any sign of a break-in, but the drawers and things —
There wasn't anything missing that I could tell, but somebody had —
[Man] Somebody had gone through all your stuff.
[Flowers]
Had gone through my stuff.
[Man] You think they were -
But they didn't steal anything?
[Flowers] No. No. My jewelry -
I mean, I had jewelry here. It was still here.
[Man] You think they were tryin' to look for somethin' on us?
[Flowers]
I think so. I mean, why else? Uh —
[Man] You weren't missin' any — any kind of papers or anything?
[Flowers]
Like what kind of papers?
[Man] Well, I mean, any kind of personal records... or checkbooks or anything like that — phone records?
- [Flowers] Do I have any?
- [Man] Yeah.
- [Flowers] Uh-uh. I mean, why would I?
- [Man] I don't know. I just —
[Flowers] You usually call me, for that matter.
And besides, who would know?
[Man] Uh, but I just think that if everybody's on record denying it... you got no problem.
Hold on just a sec here, people.
- Where'd he go?
- [Reporters Clamoring]
[Female Reporter]
Do you have any comments... about the allegations from Gennifer Flowers and the tape recordings?
She was worried about being assumed to be guilty just because her name was brought in.
I said, "That's not true.
Even if your name gets used, in the absence of proof, nobody can prove you're guilty.
Don't worry about it. Tell the truth. Just tell 'em that you didn't do it." That's all I ever said.
- [Male Reporter] How do you know her?
- See ya.
[Male Reporter]
Thank you, Governor.
[Male Reporter] Did the governor at any time tell you on the telephone... to just tell the truth about what happened?
He told me to just deny it.
[Male Reporter]
Did Governor Clinton use a condom?
- [Reporters Snickering, Laughing]
- Jesus. Right here.
Right here.
Ladies and gentlemen — Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna put this to a stop... if there are any further questions that are degrading, in my opinion, like that.
Now, right here, sir.
[Male Reporter]
You were paid by the Star.
Did anyone ever approach you from the Republican Party — perhaps another Democratic candidate — to urge you to tell this story publicly?
- Yes, they did.
- Who?
- I can't say.
- Wait. You're saying —
Wait, are you saying that somebody from another campaign —
Democratic Party or Republican Party — approached you to tell this story?
Was it the Democratic Party or was it the Republican Party, Ms. Flowers?
It was the Republican Party.
We knew we'd get attacks, but, I mean, you know —
We just couldn't believe the press would pick up a tabloid story that somebody —
I mean, we're at a new low in a way.
That's why it's so important.
But we are fighting back.
Somebody who's been through a lot of tough elections... is James Carville, who's known as the Ragin' Cajun in the business.
- [Scattered Applause]
- We'd like him to say a couple of words to you.
[Carville] Uh, we have a tough fight comin' right down the stretch.
It's gonna come out that Roger Ailes is behind a lot of this stuff before the election... that you been seein' about Governor Clinton.
- Okay? Ailes.
- [Man] Boo!
And of course Bush and Georgette Mosbacher and everything.
Let me tell you what's at stake in this election.
Every time that somebody comes along that's got some ideas — a Democrat comes along — the Republicans come up here and they ambush him.
Remember Muskie?
Okay?
That is standard procedure.
And here comes Clinton.
He comes to New Hampshire.
People here are hurtin'.
They want hope. They want somebody with vision. He gives it to 'em.
So what do Republicans do?
They get together with their wedge issues and they knock it off.
If they succeed this time, it's gonna be every time.
You are never going to get a presidential candidate. Okay?
You're never gonna get somebody to come up here and run for president... that's served 11 years as governor who's got any kind of experience.
Okay? And every time somebody comes up, they're gonna do it.
If we win this, then you have knocked this shit back forever.
- [Applause]
- Okay?
And every time that we get a Democrat that we can believe in...
Roger Ailes a-a-and Georgette Mosbacher —
You know that she's the secretary of the person closest to Bush.
You know what she said?
She can't wait till this election's over so she can get her Maserati and her jewels back.
That's the mind-set you're fightin' against.
And if they beat us back —
Paul Tsongas —
Look, he ain't gonna win anything, okay?
This is not about Paul Tsongas.
It's about George Bush and Roger Ailes and Georgette Mosbacher... and the whole sleazy little cabal of 'em that wanna keep hold of anything... and that wanna knock anybody off that we believe in... and anything that we care about.
And if we beat them and you're out there... and your knuckles get tired or your feet get cold or anything else... you think about that.
Because if they knock us off, then so what?
The next one that comes up, they gonna knock the next one off.
- [Applause, Cheering]
- And the next one and everything else.
And you know what kind of shit you're gonna get?
You're gonna get the kind of Supreme Court that you got.
You're gonna get the kind of four different positions on civil rights that you get from 'em.
You gonna get tax breaks for the wealthy.
You gonna get a guy that doesn't know what a grocery store scanner is. Okay?
So let's go. We got —
You know, we got six more days to go.
And don't forget who the real enemy is in here.
And don't forget what we're really campaigning against. Thank y'all very much.

[Female Announcer] Some say his campaign appears to slip further every day.
Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton remains tight-lipped... about a controversial letter regarding the Vietnam draft.
Ask the president when he gets off the plane... to call the Pentagon and ask how the letter got out.
W-W-Wait a minute.
What do we got here?
What is the Pentagon doing in the middle of a political campaign?
And what is the Pentagon doing leaking something... that we asked for November 6 that they didn't give us?
Now, Governor Clinton has a character problem, but I take it that your line of...
Governor Clinton has no character problem.
He's passed his character test.
Well, I mean, he has not denied that he has engaged in marital infidelity.
He denied a specific one.
- He has said that he had problems in his marriage.
- That's right.
And he has talked about the draft.
And to some people, it's a character problem.
Bill Clinton's passed his character test throughout his life and throughout this campaign.
And he's shown it through his commitments to real fights.
What he's gonna do in this campaign is focus on what's important to the American people — on jobs and education.
That's what the American people care about.
They wanna move into the future.
They don't want to be diverted by side issues... and they're not gonna let the Republican attack machine divert them.
- [Applause]
- I'm getting sick and tired —
I am — every single night... hearing one of these carping little liberal Democrats... jumping all over my you-know-what.
- And I can't wait for this campaign.
- [Applause, Cheering]
The friction in this is gonna be too much for Clinton to survive.
I think it's only really a matter of days before he'll have to get out... if not hours.
- Tell me your name.
- John Bickerstaff.
- John, Hillary Clinton.
- I'm the night baker.
I think if we could just keep one-on-one and one-on-one, energy, energy, energy...
- I think we can make it.

- [Woman] I bet they miss Arkansas.
- They do.
Well, it's a lot like home.
Don't you think it is?
- [Woman] I mean, it's what he's gonna do.
- That's exactly right.
That's the bottom line right there.
I don't wanna hear any more of this "read my lips" business.
- Not charisma.

Proven ability to change.

You're not worried about his big, hardball, negative tactics... that have worked for them for 15 years?

I'm convinced that if they try it, we'll hit 'em back and they'll buckle.
What are we gonna do when George Bush attacks us?
I mean, there's the story of AndrewJackson — was in a duel with a guy, and the guy shot and knocked him down.
The guy started walkin'. He says, "Hold to, sir.
Sit still there for a second. It's my turn."
Why can't we attack George Bush?
Why can't we talk about the lowest economic growth in the last 50 years?
Why can't we talk about there being a political hack as drug czar in this country?
Why can't we talk about the fact that he has done nothin' about education... the environment — the deficit's outta control.
He said "no new taxes."
You can just go —
Why is it that I'm always asked...
"What are we gonna do when George Bush attacks us?"
Why don't you go ask George Bush what's he gonna do when we hold him accountable... for all the wrong that he's done to this country?
A-And you can segue, you know, right into Bush.
The idea is, he reeks of yesterday.
He has the stench of yesterday.
He is so yesterday, if I think of yesterday — if I think of an old calendar —
I think of George Bush's face on it.

Bush more negative — net negative, by about 10... and Perot even fave/un-fave at around 37.
So that represents a good six-point change or more.

Can you make 2,000 signs that are —
I am not at all convinced that a bunch of hodgepodge, handheld, homemade signs... are gonna make the impact visually... from both a television point of view and from a podium point of view... that a sea of the same kind of sign across the hall.
May I just add that the problem is that we have two kinds of signs.
We have thin, red signs — white-on-red signs — and then we have rectangular white-on-blue signs.
We have a mixed message out on the floor.
We went through this twice before at two other conventions... and that's basically the problem.
And also, Brown put out new signs last night that were white on red... in which the letters — the white letters — were bigger than our letters.
And so they looked better.
How are we gonna foll —

Unbelievable.
The perception is that Clinton has succeeded... in pushing out one of his chief rivals in the presidential race.
But on the other hand,
Clinton campaign advisers... were counting on Perot to help them, especially in the South.
Perot, with his harsh attacks on President Bush... worked to soften up the incumbent... and that was perceived to be a help to the Democratic candidate.
How's that?
Any kind of political earthquake like this increases the intensity of coverage.

But that's just it. There's no less time to go back to him and say, "Read my lips."
[Stephanopoulos]
"Read my lips. No. Read the record."
[Woman]
Um, he takes longer than anybody.
[Carville Groans]
Then cut somewhere else.
Let's get three times of,
"Read my lips."
[Stephanopoulos] Where else can we cut?
"Now he wants you," not "asking you."
"Government spending in Arkansas, the lowest in the nation."
- [Woman] Which three facts?
- We're going with spending.
But in terms of scripts tonight, we're gonna test alternatives —
- one with welfare and one with spending.
- [Woman] Okay.
[Man] I think for recording, we should record the spending one.
Spending has priority.
If welfare's possible as a second shot —
Mandy, here's the way to save maybe a half a second or a second.
- [Mandy] Yeah?
- Under the second announcer... change the sentence to, "Now he wants you to believe what he says about Bill Clinton."
[Mandy]
Actually, what I changed it to was...
"Now he's asking you to believe his attacks against Bill Clinton."
- Fine. Either way. That's better.
- [Man] The other thing we could do, Mandy —
- [Mandy] Yeah.
- Maybe we could say —
Where we say, "No, Mr. President.
This time we're gonna read the facts"... maybe could just say,
"No. This time we're gonna read the facts."
- [Stephanopoulos] Better.
- [Mandy] Yeah.
"No, sir."
Maybe that's a Southern thing, but, "No, sir." "No — No, sir."
"No, sir."
But I just think it's very important we get at the end, we get that "read my lips."
I know that that will drive them — the voters —
It's the most famous broken promise in the history of American politics.
[Mandy] I'm just telling you that in the way it's set up to be factual... and, you know, big facts —
What visual were you thinking of with the fact?
[Mandy]
A big, you know, block of a fact sign.
Okay. Let's do that.
But let's just get this spot produced.
[Mandy]
Hey. I'm sitting in a studio. I'm doin' it.
- Talk to ya later.
- Bye!
I'll bet you one thing.
I just wanna say one thing. If this —
You need to call Mandy back and tell her to be sure that she gets that "read —"
No. Not with me. To be sure she gets
"read my lips" in three times.
One day, in my time, in my political career —
Every time that you suggest something to a media person... their first reaction is,
"We can't do that."
Every time.
"Well, we can't do that."
It doesn't take you long to get to the second time though.
Yeah. I know. But just one time,
I would just like to say, "Let's do that."
Say, "Fine. That's easy, man.
What do you need? Here it is."
James, this idea was suggested a half hour ago.
Your script has been made in 20 minutes.
- She's in the studio producing it.
- The studio — producing it.
- That's 45 minutes.
- We've gone from a half hour... to a concept to a spot.
- What the fuck do you want?
- Okay. I'm a hog. I'm a hog.
I suppose we could've gotten on the satellite to get it out in 30 minutes!
You haven't even asked, but it'll probably be at the focus group tonight at 6:00.
And, you know, most campaigns, it takes 'em two days to get a spot out and run it. So okay.
You're right. You're right. Mandy's great.
Mandy's great. She's great.
- What was the last line?
- "Read my lips."
"No, sir. This time, we're gonna read the record."
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
- Uh-uh? Uh-uh?
- "This time we're gonna read the record."
- Uh-uh! U h-uh!
I like that. Who was the "uh-uh" man?
You were the "uh-uh" man?
- That little Greek is creative.
- You gonna call Mandy to give her the "uh-uh"?
I can't wait till you —

[Male Reporter]
Mary? Mary Matalin?
The demos in London —
You were talking about —
I am saying it is vintage Clinton... that it is a pathological pattern of deception.
He is an obsessive politician.
When he has been asked about his antiwar activities in the past... he has hedged, bobbed and weaved.
He has said to Frank White in his 1982 race,
"I don't know what he's talking about."
He has said in other races, "Oh, I just attended a few marches to listen to the speeches."
He organized. He marched.
He wrote. He spoke.
According to Father McSorley, he was a main antiwar organizer.
Why doesn't he just say that?
It's like the draft. Why didn't he just say he was trying to avoid the draft?
No one is questioning that. They're questioning why he always prevaricates on these issues.
If we cannot believe anything he has said about his past... how can we believe anything he's saying about the future?
- [Female Reporter] Mary, I —
- I gotta get to my plane.
[Man] I have a question for Mr. Carville.
Did Bill Clinton go to Moscow?
- Are two pages missing from his passport?
- [Laughter]
Did he organize antiwar rallies while he was in Moscow?
- Did he graduate from Oxford?
- [Guests Laughing]
Yes, he went to Moscow. He used to brag about it in speeches when he ran for office.
He went to Warsaw too and, I don't know, Oslo and wherever else.
And yet as a reporter from one of the big papers called me —
"Did he have a transmitter planted in his cavity while he was there?"
Wh-What diff— Why do you ask me a question like that: "Did he go to Moscow?"
What difference does it make?
In 1970, Bill Clinton went to Moscow.
Okay.
An answer!
[Carville] But — What? It does. I mean, he's answered it a thousand times.
He's said that he went.
What — It's irrelevant to the question.
And that's my point.
- What did he do there?
- How the hell do I know what he did in Moscow?
I mean, I don't know what he did.
Maybe — I don't — You know —

We believe the script goes something like this... with appropriate visuals of printing presses.
"The Republican campaign..."
Is what?
What it is is that Bush is buyin' up to $10 million in printing in Brazil... and the Brazilian TV ran it.
It's these huge printing presses with Bush-Quayle material coming —
I mean, it's perfect for the news — for television.

[Greenberg] But they have pictures of the convention in them.

You see, 'cause tomorrow, who got the contract... and how they did that, what guys have lobbying things in Brazil —
Yeah. There's no sense in this thing being a one-day story.
I don't believe. I think we gotta kinda ooze this thing out a bit.
I'll call and find out... call the source.

Okay, this was a — This was aired during the Republican convention —
- So that's pri —
- which means that it was primary money.
- Still government money.
- It's still...
I have a feeling it's R.N.C., is what I've thought all along.
- No, it can't be R.N.C.
- It says Bush/Quayle.
- It can't be R.N.C.
- It says Bush/Quayle.
It's illegal.
- Let's hope it's R.N.C.
- The issue's moot.
All we got to do is go out and get the latest filing and see if there's a check.
I think we looked on it earlier.
We didn't find it.
We'll check now with updates.
It's possible it's a subcontract, you know, that —
In fact, it is likely that they've done this through their — maybe it was a media firm... and it was subcontracted through the media firm.
It's unlikely there's a direct check.
No, but somebody said, if you look at the translation... that they went to Ohio and Texas and California.
- Right, but it could be —
- And where they came was Rio.
- All we can do is check —

There's something —
We knew he spent a lot of time overseas.
Now he's spending a lot of taxpayer money over there, or something.
Foreign aid is something — something like that.

They have printed materials that were printed in Brazil, okay?
What do they say happened to the materials?
Yeah, but if they can't produce the materials... then they either got 'em or they were given to 'em.

George Bush's election year promises.
Okay?
Oh... Oh, oh, oh, oh!
A lot more. A lot more.
Okay. I'm gonna go back and see.
You know, George Bush mentioned the draft one time.
He mentioned it one time... and let's see how many stories that was written on the draft.
Oh, okay. Well, you said if you wanna say something, then say something.
I'm giving you an example of there's a lot more fascination... with the quote, "draft issue," unquote, or Gennifer Flowers... than there is with George Bush promising $16 zillion more... than he could ever spend in an election year.
I believe that on any number of things... that we are held to a different standard.
I think it is absolutely ludicrous... that no one ever asked George Bush about Iran-Contra.
Two cabinet secretaries saying Bush was lying.
No one ever said a damn thing.
You get this memo from Baker... about him knowing about — about Iraq having chemical weapons going.
And then there's no follow-up because,
God, you can't askJim Baker a question.
This man is down deep —
He's beyond being questioned.
He gives everybody tickets to the opera.
We can't question him.
You know?
This is not directed any more at the Washington Post.

"Clinton's numbers don't add up!
Clinton's numbers don't add up!"
- That is so fucking true.
- You know?
It's so unbelievable.
If we say 50 plus 50 is 104, and they say 50 plus 50 is 104,000... they'll say, "Well, both of them are stretching their numbers a little bit."
- Hello? Yeah.
- [Laughs] Exactly.
Oh, the goddamn stories.
They're not going with the story.
The printing... The —
Printing the, uh —
Shit, you know.
[Carville] I think that they've given up on it now, Governor.
The Bush people said they got the guy wired, said, "Well, I just did it.
It was an offshore operation," you know?
So they're trying to nail him. So it's not dead, but it's just not going tonight.
[Woman On TV In Background, Indistinct]

Okay. Give me a call later, okay?

Keep repeating "Bush was on the defensive" all night.
Okay. He was.
Hell, he was on the ropes.
- Which way we going?
- This way.
- Whoo!
- Let's go!
Whoo!
Let's go. Roll.
- Heads up!
- [Laughter, Chattering]
Little news!
Where's the —
Where are we supposed to be goin', Vicki?
We gotta find out what Bush said.
Jeff, do you have a walkie-talkie?
[Man]
Be careful.
I gotta find out what Bush said.
We're ready.
Talk to Jerry real quick?
Do you mind?
What did Bush say in the last second after Clinton did Baker?
He said, "That's what worries me."
Clinton said — the economic policy.
- Quick, before we, um —
- [Chattering]
Another good night for Bill Clinton.
Three debates, three wins.
Bush was on the defensive all night long.
I think he was put on the defensive by Bill Clinton over the economy... and by Ross Perot over Saddam Hussein... and Ross Perot over the mess in Washington, and he couldn't get out of it.
It's the record. It's the agenda.
It's the qualifications.
Governor Clinton and the Democrats don't like when we talk about character... but 54 of them thought character was a very big issue... when they rejected President Bush's nominee for secretary of defense... citing character insufficiencies because he flirted with women in elevators.
There's no doubt that George Bush's attacks on us have an effect.
The effect they're having is on George Bush.
Negative.
See?
They're working against Bush.
[Man]
They have no effect on your campaign?
Again now, don't take my word for it.
Look at every poll that you see.
This is not a sports event.
People don't get out their peanuts and hot dogs and rate these things.
They want to know —
Focus on the choice between these candidates and their philosophies.
And we have tried to do that in each debate.
We're not trying to create drama.
We are not a made-for-TV candidate.
Yes, Governor Clinton won on Geraldo-like activities.
That's his shtick.
He's a performer. He's a phony.
I mean, he walks into the audience.
He puts Geraldo to shame.
That's not our gig. We are a leader.
We are mature.
We have a breadth and depth of experience that's unrivaled on that stage... and that's all we've ever tried to do... and have been very successful in each of these debates doing... and you'll all be eating crow, because that's how the American voters look at this.
They don't need another Geraldo.
They need a leader in the White House.
- Here's ABC.
- Great.
Oh, Perot came in second, not Bush.
Hey, Trish, are you sure about this?
I heard Bush was second.
I hope it was Perot.
I just got it from —
I just got it from Ricki.
Great.
[Trish] CBS is something like 35, Clinton,
29, Perot, and then the balance is Bush.
I'm going to double-check that one.
- Bush came in third in both.
- As far as I know.
- One-third undecided, one-third weak.
- Right.
- That constitutes about 18% of the electorate.
- What was the other one-third?
Two-thirds were weak Clinton, and one-third undecided.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?
So in terms of our universe of folks, that was a strong showing for Perot.
[Applause, Cheering]
[Clinton]
James, thank you.
Thank you, Governor.
That was a pretty good little —
- [Woman] He's counting speaking fees.
- Kodak memories.
[Laughing]
Speaking fees.
- [Clinton] I didn't humiliate him after his morning television performance?
- No, no, no.
- No, no, we had the whole thing.
- Hi, Mama.
[Chattering]
He should do a page and a half... that says every time we've had it your way —
I mean, you had your chance.
We've tried it your way for the last 12 years.
It's time for a change.
But do it on every issue.
- Right.
- That should be tomorrow's rally speech.
Right.
Repeat it for jobs, for health care, for taxes, for everything, for education.
That's the refrain for the last three weeks.
Okay? Bye.
- [Carville Chattering]
- [Woman] Mary?
[Matalin]
Oh, the trip.
[Carville] The trip. I'm not —
I'm not gonna tell you, see, you know?

You're not gonna tell me till we leave?
No, I'm just gonna tell you the day that we're leavin'... and how long that we're going for.

Goddamn, if we don't carry Georgia, we're going to look terrible.
I say if we lose Georgia, we lose the race.
[Clinton On TV]
I need your help.

[Man On TV] The governor's voice is completely gone... and he will not be able to speak.

I'll be there Tuesday.
Fight on. Don't give up. Go!

It's a campaign that cost at least $60 million.
[All Laughing]
[Reporter Continues, Indistinct]
[Carville] It is the most expensive single act of masturbation in the history of the world.
[All Laughing]
[Female Reporter] His voice almost gone,
Hillary Clinton has been pitching in.
[Hillary Clinton] We'll have to be real quiet to be able to hear him.
If you will be my voice tomorrow,
I'll be yours for four years.
[Cheering]
I thought of that, didn't I?
I'll take credit for it.
Steve Denari, who's the director of the I llinois Perot office... and he wants to talk to someone confidentially.
[Hums]
Read it to me.
Well, what does names, addresses —
I can send you a fax with names, addresses, phone numbers of who you had an affair with.
It wouldn't make it true.
Yeah, I just — Believe me —
[Carville I n Background] No, he wasn't, but I'm just gonna tell the son of a bitch —
Believe me that it's been looked at by every major national news organization.
Everything.
And it is completely bullshit.
If you went on the radio... and said that Bill Clinton is the father of an illegitimate black child... you would be laughed at.
People would think you're crazy.
[Carville Chattering]
We're not gonna lose.
We are gonna win.
He is gonna be president.
Well, no, but, I mean —
Don't think of it like that.
Let's take it at two levels.
Number one, of course it's not gonna matter.
But number two, think of yourself.
I guarantee you that if you do this... you'll never work in Democratic politics again.
Maybe you don't want to.
I'm not saying it matters.
You will be embarrassed before the national press corps.
People will think —
Nobody will believe you... and people will think you're scummy.
The alternative is you don't do it.
It causes you some temporary pain... with people who tomorrow aren't gonna matter... and you have a campaign that understands... that in a difficult time you did something right.
Um, and, you know, that's important.
I mean, it doesn't mean anything... and we can't do anything for you specifically or anything like that... but you know that you did the right thing... and that you didn't, um... dishonor yourself.
[Chattering, Shouting]
Oh, my God!
[Stephanopoulos]
Um, and finally, before I give him the floor... for what I hope isn't the last time... uh, I think we all know that, um... besides Bill Clinton, one person really gave this campaign focus.
And one person wrote what I call a haiku —
[Scattered Laughter]
About five months ago:
Change versus more of the same.
The economy, stupid.
I think if you did a Nexis, it would come up in about a thousand places.
- [All Laughing]
- And don't forget health care.
Um, you know,
I was kidding James yesterday.
I said he was about to pass... from a role of regular human being into the role of a legend.
[Murmuring, Chuckling]
And I think he really deserves it... because probably for the first time in a generation tomorrow... we're gonna win.
And that means that more people are gonna have better jobs.
People are gonna pay a little less for health care, get better care... and more kids are gonna go to better schools.
Um, and so, thanks.
[Cheering]
[Cheering Continues]
There's a simple doctrine.
Outside of a person's love... the most sacred thing that they can give is their labor.
And somehow or another along the way, we tend to forget that.
And labor is a very precious thing that you have.
And any time that you can combine labor with love... you've made a merger.
And I think we're gonna win tomorrow... and I think that the governor is gonna fulfill his promise and change America... and I think many of you are gonna go on and help him.
I'm a political professional.
That's what I do for a living.
I'm proud of it.
We changed the way campaigns are run.
[Camera Shutter Clicks]
Used to be there was a hierarchy.
If you were on one floor, you didn't go to another floor.
If you were somewhere on the organizational chart... there was no room for you there.
Everybody was compartmentalized.
And you people showed that you could be trusted.
Everybody in this room. Everybody.
And people are gonna tell you you're lucky.
You're not.
Ben Hogan said, "Golf is a game of luck.
The more I practice, the luckier I get."
[Laughing]
The harder you work, the luckier you are.
I was 33 years old before I ever went to Washington or New York.
I was 42 before I won my first campaign.

Hey, Bob.
- How are you, man?
- What's going on?
You pretty tired?
Pretty tired. Um —
But just, you know, when you get up there, and he says this is the last rally... or the last chance or whatever it was that he says —
- Shakes you up, right?
- Huh?
Shakes you up.
It was pretty hard, yeah.
I was pretty shaken up.
Paulie, I got up this morning.
As I was driving to work, I started to cry.
I couldn't keep it — I just can't —
I can't cope right now.
Right.
Man, I'm scared.
Because we're all gonna have to jump off a bridge.
Because, you know —
Because of the last two days.
Because of the last two days.
Yeah.
You know, it's kind of a mass thing.
We can all just drink some Kool-Aid.
Okay, man. Have a good flight.
See you when you get in.
Bye.
Hey, it's James.
What do you think?

Dan Quayle came home to Indiana... where he has never lost a race.
You think it's gonna be tight in NewJersey?

[Man] What was that mumbling about seven points?
Oh, CBS. We dropped overnight.
So now they're figuring out how we can lose.

- [Laughing, Scoffs]
I'm on the floor.
I'm literally on the floor.
I can't take it.
[Sighs]
[Stephanopoulos]
Oh, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We tried hard.
We came up a little short.
- To those who embraced our crusade —
- [Stephanopoulos Laughs] Oh, God!
We say thank you.
To President Bush, who's won reelection, we offer our full support...
[Stephanopoulos]
Oh, God.
- Our prayers and our hopes for a better America.
- Shut up.
Throughout this campaign,
I've endeavored... to bring my message of change to the American people.
[Bob] Where's Derek Humphry when you need him?
[Carville] And over 42% of you people embraced that message.
- I am grateful to each and every one of you.
- Are we in favor of assisted suicide?
Hillary and I and Chelsea will never forget you... the way you welcomed us into your homes, your towns and your cities.
- [Chattering, Laughing]
- It is not that we... have lost this battle, it is whether we endure in a larger war.
[Laughing]
In a stunning come-from-behind upset that shocked pundits... political professionals, journalists, people around the world...
- George Herbert Walker Bush —
- Was reelected today.
Proved his political resiliency beyond any doubt whatsoever... and was reelected today over Bill Clinton...
[Phone Ringing]
Garnering 274 electoral votes, only four over.
But as they say, it's not horseshoes and it's not hand grenades.
And George Bush will return —
We repeat, George Bush will return to the White House for another four years.
- [Man] And what's the other one?
- Florida is now 42, Bush, 41.5, Clinton.
- That's what we're getting, so —
- It's started then.
- [All Talking At Once]
- You know what that means.
Uh —
Popkin talked to Warren, whatever, the head of V.R. S... and he's gonna talk to him in four minutes, but his initial impression is it's a landslide.
Could be up to 12, maybe 400 electoral votes.
[Laughs]
- What's this?
- We'll wait and see.
- Holy shit.
- What's this? Is this the new one?
Arkansas.
Connecticut's fine.
- Delaware's fine. Georgia's good.
- Georg —
- Wait, wait, wait. Georgia, fine.
- Georgia's good.
Iowa's done.
- Illinois is done.
- Illinois is a blowout.
- [Both] Indiana, we're ahead.
- [Woman] Indiana?
- Kentucky —
- Kentucky is five.
- Michigan is 11. New York's done.
- Holy shit. We're pulling away in Ohio.
- Oklahoma, we're up.
- Tied in Texas.
Tied in Texas.
It looks good.
Now let's just say that...
I like the text here.
Can you beep Wendy, please?
- Oh, you got it.
- [Whistles]
Looks pretty good.
Look at — Look at Indiana.
Wait, wait.
- Look at Indiana, 42-40.

It doesn't matter if we win.
Those people are gonna shit. Oh, excuse me.
[Stammers] In the White House, how would you like to be —
[Whispering, Indistinct]
- [Whispering, Indistinct]
- Look at Texas. Go down to Texas.
- Even.
- Yeah, 39-39.
[Whispering, Indistinct]
- Perot's kind of holding, isn't he?
- [Stephanopoulos] He held.
Yeah, he held. His numbers held.
- I'm sort of surprised, frankly.
- This could be a landslide.
Probably don't have anything yet.
Let me — I gotta call Zell.
[Laughs]
[Stephanopoulos]
Goddamn.
- [Woman, Indistinct]
- We up?
- Up seven.
- Oh.
[Stephanopoulos]
This is very raw though.
[Man]
You know what? Huh?
- [Stephanopoulos] Hello?
- Nothing.
Is the governor there?
Um, well, if he wants to call, tell him things look, um, outstanding.
Really good.
[Carville]
Are you kidding me?
It's gotta be 10. Okay.
- [Chattering]
- [Phone Ringing]
[Chattering, I ndistinct]

[Man]
Okay.
[Second Phone Ringing]
[Carville] Well, who's got —
You don't have them all on your computer?
- This all tracks.
- Yeah.
But if I call you at 3:00 my time... you can look in your computer and we can know everything.
Like, when I try to say it, it's gonna be hard.
I don't know. What do you say?
Mr. President-Elect?
I think you gotta say Mr. — I assume you just gotta say Mr. President.
You say, "Congratulations,
Mr. President."
That's weird.
This is the latest numbers at 2:00, okay?
California, we're up by 19.
Boxer's gonna win.
Colorado, we're up by 10.
[Ringing]
How long does he intend to talk?
This sounds like an awful long speech.
[Man]
Oh, yeah. It'll be an hour or two.
[Laughing]
[Greenberg] Can we go to the party before he finishes?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, let me just run through this.
- I think this is a pretty good structure.
- [Stephanopoulos] Okay.
Third, which is the real take-home point... and I really sold on them, which is this won't happen overnight.
- Yeah, we gotta do that.
- That's the most important point to make.
Yeah, I want a cold beer.
What kind of special today?
Well, the special today is pepperoni and black olive.
And also we've got that 50-cent draft
Busch beer, if you want that.
- [Laughing]
- No, I don't want Busch beer.
Give me the —
Shit, I ain't drinking no Busch beer.
Give me a Budweiser.

- Bud. And what would you like to eat?
Huh? I need a beer quickly.
Quickly, quickly.
No Busch beer.

They wave, they smile, they hug.
The Gores go sit down.
Hillary and Chelsea go sit down.
Governor gives his speech.
I can't imagine the headlines tomorrow.
I'm sorry?
The headlines tomorrow are gonna be —
We need — In that section, you've gotta add a sentence about the young people.
- And it would be nice to have the 83-year-old —
- What section?
This section here.
It's gotta be something specifically about how young people voted...
- in record numbers and changed —
- In record numbers. With record enthusiasm.
Their generation's gonna come —
It should come after the 83-year-old woman.
See if we can find a story in the catalog with a young person.
[Exhales]
We gotta get him something real soon.
These changes have to be made quickly.
We gotta get it right out to him.
- How do I get it to him?
- We'll take care of it.
You like "everything" better than "the country"?
[Man]
I'm sorry?
Do you like, "Together we can make the country and love everything it was meant to be"... better than "Together we can make the country and love the country it was meant to be"?
That implies an inadequacy with the country, doesn't it? The latter formulation?
Mm-hmm.
That's nice. That's real nice.
So just make that one change and get it back.
Yes.

They were giddy. It's like it didn't —
I mean, they're just like —
Are you, like, happy or are you scared... or are you nothing or do you want to just, like, cry or what?
The crying was before.
Maybe it'll be later too.
No, it's just like... floating.

- What?
- On your chest in front of you —
- This one?
Your white one is totally unnecessary because that beige one in your hand —
Okay. This is the everywhere pass?
That is a very exclusive... There are only about five of those in existence.
- Okay.
- And it gets you backstage with the governor.
- Where am I supposed to meet them? What room?
- There are only about five.
- I-I-I —
- You don't know?
In the director's office of the State House.
But it's almost impossible to get there because there are so many... tens of thousands of people out on the street.
I'll meet you out here.
I'm just going to use the ladies' room.

I mean, it's looking like close to 400.
It's a landslide.
Ohio's not called yet.
North Carolina's not called yet.

Dead even in Florida.
You know, it's just unbelievable.
You oughta be the —

And I just gotta tell you,
I just appreciate this so much.
This was the best thing I ever did.
We can try. He's up there talking now though, you know.
He's up there giving his speech. Yep.
You don't?
But the one thing you gotta be —
We really want you to say whatever you want to say tonight... but you just gotta be careful about being too programmatic.
You should definitely be New Democrat, and we love Hillary's new patriotism thing... which he tried to put in there.
Also you gotta do at the end, he goes back to the announcement speech... which is very important.
But you know, just say what —
Speak from your heart tonight.
I mean, that's all that matters.
Say what you want to say.
I mean, this is your night.

Well, this is like the earth--
- Yeah.
- ...and what it's going to be like. l'm scared because it's going to get very, very, very hot.
When the ice is going to melt and the sea's going to flood, most of the countries will either be under water or a desert.
The animals will die.
The trees will die and fall down.
Everyone's just going to die. l'm scared that it's going to happen quite soon. lt scares me so much, l was actually shaking. l don't think that people are doing enough to sort this problem out.
Global warming's real, and it's an important problem, but the scare tactics used to motivate people have gone too far.
The hysteria blocks clear thinking and diverts billions if not trillions of dollars to the wrong solutions.
Bjorn Lomborg. l'm one of the world's most influential people.
He's being called one of the 50 people who could save the planet.
Thank you, Bjorn, for joining us.
Author of The Skeptical Environmentalist.
The Skeptical Environmentalist.
The Skeptical Environmentalist. l wrote a book saying there's something that we've misunderstood.
People got incredibly upset, and they said ''That can't be true.''
Bjorn Lomborg is a traitor.
Some people see him as the enemy.
Now all of a sudden, a guy nobody ever heard of came along, and he's got the answer.
He's been described as misleading, dangerous--
Your opinion has been disputed in your country and elsewhere.
They called him a parasite, an idiot.
Bjorn is definitely a controversial figure, and mainly because a lot of people actually misunderstand his message.
He used to be with Greenpeace, left it, then started asking questions about environmental activists, about their agendas.
This guy needs to be taken down, not put up.
Bjorn is contributing significantly to our awareness.
Lomborg is somebody l admire very much.
You're not helping the world if you're reinforcing Bjorn Lomborg. l can tell you that.
He's making it harder to achieve the policies that we need. to prevent a potential catastrophic outcome on Earth.
Climate is angry, and humans are provoking it.
And we're now at a turning point.
Millions will starve to death. lf we only listen to worst case scenarios, that's unlikely to make for good public priorities.
We're likely to be saying we should be spending most of our money on the people who shout the loudest. lt's going to get a lot worse unless we do something about it.
The hottest temperature ever recorded--
The future of human civilization is at stake.
The fate of the planet is at stake. l was born in 1965 on January 6.
My mom was a primary school teacher, and my dad was a florist. l actually come out of a gardening family in Denmark.
And even as a young boy, l loved exploring nature and the environment.
When l was 1 1 , l decided to become a vegetarian because l didn't want to kill animals.
When we stop nuclear power, we will usher in a new energy alternative.
The whole idea that we needed to stop nuclear power and we needed to move away from oil-- all that kind of stuff was very high on the agenda, and so l remember saying to my friends
''Why don't we build a windmill?''
And we got all excited about it.
We were drawing out sketches and everything, and we started digging, and we dug up quite a bit of the garden before my stepdad came out and said ''What are you doing?''
And we were like
''We're building a windmill.'' l just recall that he wasn't as pleased as we were with that project.
My love turned to fear when l learned about nitrogen pollution causing dead zones around the coast of Denmark. l was very worried about the environment. l was a member of Greenpeace, and l was very, very angry at the center-right government because they weren't doing enough. l think l was just like most of my friends, worried about the fact that the world was coming apart and we weren't doing enough.
Years later, l was going to be a researcher, and l was teaching college students here in Denmark. l was settling into that understanding this was going to be my life.
And when l was at UCLA in Los Angeles for a professional conference when l was a tenured professor, l was just wandering in the bookstores, flipping through magazines, that l ended up reading this story.
He was telling me all this stuff about the environment-- that the air pollution's better, that the water pollution-- that there's virtually no problems that we're not actually dealing with and doing better.
We have longer lives, we're better fed, we're healthier, and also, if you live in the Western world, where we're richest, we have cleaner air, cleaner water.
We have lots of things that actually make us safer.
My initial reaction was
''Right wing propaganda. lt can't be true.''
But he kept on saying
''Go check the data.'' l figured, All right, l'll actually show him wrong, and we'll have fun doing that, so got his book, went back to Denmark, and assigned some of the smartest students l have to go through this whole book and show how wrong it was.
For half a year, we went through all the different issues, and as it turned out, there was a lot of what he said that was true.
There's actually a lot of things that are getting better. lt doesn't mean that there are no problems, but it means that we can actually start thinking this is not a doomed planet.
This is a place where we'll, in general, leave the next generation in a better state than in a worse state.
Mostly l think we suffer from not understanding the data and making clear priorities, so l founded the Copenhagen Consensus, a think tank dedicated to bringing together the world's top economists to prioritize the world's problems based on the cost benefit analysis of the best available solutions. l tried to get information on economics on some of the biggest problems in the world to tell us how can we best spend our money in the smartest possible way.
Beginning in 2004, he assembled about ten of us to spend a couple of days looking at all kinds of proposals for how to alleviate poverty in the developing world, and what we tried to do is to rank them according to which was the most effective in terms of what you got for your money.
Copenhagen Consensus is about asking where can we do the most good.
Malnutrition, improving girls' schooling, community nutrition, vitamin A, those sorts of things.
Yeah.
And making motherhood safer.
That's good. That will work.
A lot of people believe wrongly that he denies or used to deny climate change.
You accept this is a real phenomenon.
Definitely.
Totally.
Global warming is happening.
Or that he's somehow a very sophisticated climate change denier where he has some sort of complicated way of arguing that we should do nothing or something, which-- which isn't true.
Bjorn came to public notice when he published
The Skeptical Environmentalist with Cambridge University Press.
The book is The Skeptical Environmentalist.
The Skeptical Environmentalist, in which he claims predictions of a looming global environmental disaster are grossly exaggerated and that actually we've never had it so good. ln the beginning, l got a lot of messages.
A lot of them were about
''How on earth could you think that global warming exists?'' and the other half were about
''You know that global warming exists, so why don't you act?''
Do you accept that there is human agency
- involved in this?
- Yes.
Why do you dispute, then, the measures that are being taken to control some of that human behavior?
Basically because l'm arguing we should not just solve a problem if the cost of solving that will be even greater than the problem itself.
Seems to me that there's a total lack of prioritization. l mean, this guy comes along from nowhere.
He's published nothing.
He's going to tell us the right way to solve a problem that he has no understanding of?
That book produced a storm of controversy and led to his being referred to the Committee on Scientific Dishonesty of the Royal Danish
Academy of Sciences, and that investigated his book to discover whether he was attempting consciously to deceive people.
There was a huge reaction against him, so he became a rather notorious figure. l mean, that just tells you what kind of opposition he aroused.
Any time you would challenge a consensus, you really run into a big problem.
On my birthday, incidentally, they would be coming out with this verdict which would essentially say they couldn't prove me dishonest, but that was only because l was too stupid to be dishonest, but l definitely was in breach of good scientific conduct. lt was very clear that the intent was political right up front.
They said very clearly that they wanted to make sure that l could never be named
Head of the Environmental
Assessment lnstitute. lt was a terrible experience. l didn't know whether l was going to be able to hold my ground or just be swept away by this whole thing that was bigger than me.
Was it going to cost me my job?
Was it going to cost all my employees their jobs? l honestly didn't know which way to go. lt was the worst day of my life.
Fortunately, there is an increasing number of people saying they didn't quite feel comfortable about what's just happened.
They make him a liar.
They make him a liar, a dishonest person.
...because, l mean... ln one case, there was this Dutch professor who's gathering forces in Holland to look through all of the claims to see whether they were right or wrong.
We published our results of the investigation in an American journal which is called...
There was the title--
''On the Opposition Against the Book
''The Skeptical Environmentalist
B. Lomborg.''
Over time, l think it sort of softened a little bit.
But not all that much, because l think the environmentalists are a rather impassioned group.
Read The Skeptical Environmentalist.
You think he slowed it down. l'm certain he slowed it down. lt's constantly cited.
He's a massive negative force in this issue.
The establishment, they don't want to hear a new viewpoint, and so they will do anything and also discredit you to keep you out of that conversation.
They never, ever came up and said,
''This is where Bjorn did it wrong.''
They just basically came out and said,
''He's dishonest.'' l think to a very large extent, the reason why l've been able to go out and say this stuff that's made me deeply unpopular with many people is that l feel secure in the world. l feel that fundamentally, somebody loves me.
And that comes from my mom.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
Unfortunately, she's got Alzheimer's, and she's in an old people's home.
She's not at all where she doesn't know who l am or anything, but she's definitely there where she doesn't know what happened five minutes ago.
We found her what l think is probably the best home in and around that area. lt's very beautiful, they're really sweet there. l call her every day and then l try to go visit every month.
Bye, Mom.
Total should be around, like, 60-- 50, 60 minutes.
- Yeah.
- And then there will be a lot of questions.
- Yeah, that's good.
- The usual.
Yeah, but we also have time for it, right?
We have 75 minutes.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He's invited for talks from all kinds of organizations.
Companies, governments.
Recently, he flew to the USA and then he had a talk over there, and then to Portugal, and then from Portugal to Toronto for some interviews, then down to Brazil, and then to Kenya. lt occupies a lot of his life.
What can we do about civil wars?
What can we do about water and sanitation? l was busy traveling all over the world, trying to engage people in how to best fix the most pressing problems in the world when An lnconvenient Truth came out.
An Oscar-winning documentary and literally hundreds of slideshow presentations later, the world finally is paying attention.
Mr. Gore, welcome to this committee.
We appreciate you and Professor Lomborg appearing before us today to discuss the very important issues surrounding global climate change.
Number one, l think we should immediately freeze
CO2 emissions in the United States of America.
This is a picture from--
Al Gore and l gave a presentation a couple years ago to Congress. l'm sure it's, like, the second before he realizes who l am, because he's smiling.
But l think we need to thank Al Gore for having put it on the agenda.
Al Gore and l, and l believe most of us, want to fix global warming.
This is not a discussion of whether it's true or not. lt's a discussion of how do we actually tackle it.
And l would like to argue that we're not tackling it very well right now. lf you will allow me just a very brief history of climate change legislation--
And we must make no mistake about what is now at risk.
The first earth summit, where the rich world promised to...
Of course, we did no such thing. l was at the treaty signing, and it's been 18 years since then, and we haven't done a thing.
Our children's children will read about the spirit of Kyoto. ln Kyoto in 1997, we promised much more, that we could cut our carbon emissions to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels before 2012.
Of course, we did no such thing.
The U.S. didn't ratify, but also Canada didn't do it, and Australia, many other countries. lf we'd spent that money,
Kyoto would have cost about 180 billion dollars a year.
The reduction in temperature would have been about 0.008 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. l mean, it's almost ridiculous.
You're talking about spending large sums of money to do virtually no good a hundred years from now.
We have before us
Professor Bjorn Lomborg.
- ls that pronounced right?
- That's right.
We'd like to hear your comments for as much time as you'd like,
- within reason. Thank you.
- Of course. lf we invest a dollar in HlV/AlDS, we'll probably end up doing
$40 worth of social good. lnvest it in malnutrition for micronutrients, we'll probably do about $30 worth of good.
Free trade, probably 20, malaria about $10-$15 worth of good, whereas Kyoto came out next to the bottom.
Probably for every dollar you spend, you probably do somewhere between 25 and 30 cents worth of good.
Environment ministers in New York will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow to try to find a way of rescuing the Kyoto treaty.
We've been doing climate change policy in the same failed way over and over. l think it's about time that we realize the current approach is broken.
The European Union is currently the only place in the world that has a really significant legal requirement to cut carbon emissions.
The EU has promised to cut 20 percent by 2020, and doing so by employing
20 percent renewable energy.
The problem is, if you ask the economists, it's estimated to cost about $250 billion a year.
This is assuming that the EU will continue to do this across the entire century.
Yet, the net impact by the end of the century will be to have reduced temperatures by about one-tenth of a degree Fahrenheit.
Turns out that for every dollar you've spent in EU making climate policy, you will have avoided about half a cent of climate damage. lf what you wanted to do was to do good for people, why on earth were we spending that much money on doing so little good? ls there a smarter way forward?
And the short answer is yes, there is.
We're gonna talk to Nobel laureates, climate economists, top scientists, inventors, policy makers, community organizers, people in the developing world, everyday people.
We'll take a look at some of the most promising technologies that just might provide the answers we need to this challenge.
And then l'm going to make a proposal on how to spend
$250 billion to fix climate change, along with the world's most desperate problems.
Copenhagen is hosting the United Nations
Climate Change Conference.
You just tell me where-- ls this good?
The 120 leaders of states and governments slated to meet find a cost of failure too high and finally make the hard decisions to seal a deal.
We do need to tackle climate change, but we need to tackle it smartly.
- And we're not.
- So what's dumb about this, then?
Well, fundamentally, l mean, these guys are meeting up on an 18-year-old agenda, to say, ''Let's promise carbon cuts.''
We promise all these beautiful things and then we're not gonna do them.
These international discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades.
And we have very little to show for it.
That's why l come here today.
Not to talk, but to act.
Time is running out to finalize the details.
Already, a new treaty has been ruled out for Copenhagen.
Not much happened in Copenhagen, unfortunately.
There was a lot of protests.
Lot of speeches. A lot of meetings.
But essentially no action.
And you can't fix a global problem if the largest consumers of energy, the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, aren't part of the equation.
Everybody talks about cutting carbon emission, but nobody actually does anything about it because it'll raise the cost of energy, which is politically unpopular. ln the United States, we have degenerated into a system where two parties are fighting each other and not cooperating even when it's clear that for the public's interest, they should be coming to some policies that would work.
And the quicker that we get to it, the quicker that we put in place the incentives. l have never said l'm against the government incentivizing change. l desperately want to support this bill. lt doesn't work. lt hasn't worked in Europe. lt's gonna be hugely expensive. l just think this is lunacy.
Just don't attack the President and attack the Democrats.
Work with us.
For the past 18 years, cap and trade has been proposed as the best way to tackle the climate problem.
Here's how it works.
Cap and trade sets a price on carbon usage.
Governments sell permits to companies allowing them to emit a limited amount of carbon.
That's the cap. lf those companies want to emit more, they buy additional permits from other companies that don't reach their cap.
That's the trade.
The hope is that all this evens out and that the cost makes us want to use less carbon-based fuel.
Cap and trade is an invitation to massive corruption.
Governments often give permits away for political reasons, so the companies get billions of our money and yet the carbon cost is hidden in our utility bills or the price of the products we buy. l see absolutely nothing wrong with people who want to make money and expand the economy based on efforts to decarbonize the economy.
Where we should be concerned is in efforts where people are able to make a lot of money and exploit the system.
So, a good example of that would be carbon offsetting, where companies in lndia and China were producing a chemical byproduct, the chemical name is HFC-23, and it turned out that they could sell carbon offsets to Europe for destroying this chemical.
And in the end, it was more profitable for them to make and destroy this chemical than to actually be involved in their original line of business. lt's not well known, but a leading lobbyist for the Kyoto Agreement was Enron.
They were hoping to become a trading firm in carbon permits.
There was a memo that was circulated at Enron that said this is our biggest opportunity to make money. lt's not only Enron.
Duke Energy, General Electric,
Dow Chemical.
There's a very broad consensus among big businesses that there is money to be made if the government will mandate policies that raise energy prices for consumers.
These companies can make larger profits, and that's what all this is about.
Cap and trade just keeps us with high levels of carbon pollution.
And it essentially grandfathers in the old technologies.
As long as fossil fuels are the cheapest energy, then we're gonna continue to use them.
Countries such as lndia are producing increasing amounts of carbon dioxide as they try to industrialize.
To my mind, the most important thing that's happened in the last 50 years is China and lndia getting rich. l think this is wonderful.
But in order to become rich, they have to burn coal.
There's absolutely no alternative.
That's the principal reason why cap and trade cannot solve the global problem.
Because countries like China and lndia will never accept a cap on their economies, they've said that very clearly. And why should they?
Clearly, you're not gonna get China and lndia saying oh, yeah, hey, we'll forgo having our kids, giving them an education, maybe even food and healthcare.
They're not gonna do that.
They have other and more important priorities.
There's over a billion people who don't have access to modern forms of energy at all.
There are hundreds of millions of people who don't get any light apart from what the sun provides them.
So when the sun goes down, their lives are covered by darkness. l went to Nairobi, Kenya to do a Copenhagen Consensus conference on malnutrition, but while l was there, l had the chance to go to Kibera, which is the biggest slum neighborhood in Nairobi.
When you talk about global warming, it's important, but to who are you talking about that?
People who are hungry?
People who don't have jobs?
What does global warming mean to them? lt has no meaning.
Hey.
A car?
You want this kind of a house.
With electricity and with beautiful lights and everything.
Yeah, okay. And a television.
You didn't even draw a television there.
What did you draw here?
This is a bus? Why a bus?
Okay.
That's a beautiful house by Alice, and then a car, and another house. A house, oh, and the President and Prime Minister.
And a house. They're drawing what they would like to see in the future.
But most of them want a car or--
Or a house.
Yes, yes, yes.
These are the things that they really care about. l go around the world to talk to people about what are their problems and also what are their solutions.
Yeah?
- Yeah, diseases?
- Yeah.
Yeah. What kind of diseases?
Healthcare. Yes.
Other things you worry about?
There is poor housing.
People will sometimes die and sometimes they are injured.
- So better housing.
- Yes. lf we were to spend money on making the world a better place, where should we spend that money?
Some should be spent on healthcare.
Education.
Who would spend it on education?
All right, one for education.
Who would spend it on global warming?
One, two, three, four?
Who would spend it on healthcare?
Every time l visit the developing world, l'm reminded that malnutrition and disease are much bigger concerns than global warming.
We in the developed world are fortunate to live without those fears, but we found others to replace them.
So what have you been drawing?
Well, l've been drawing the earth and l've been doing zoom-in parts.
And some places, as you can see, they've got-- They're dried up.
And people really need water.
And other places, like the South Pole and the North Pole and other places in the world, they're flooded.
What is this down here?
The sun's got to the-- lt's broken through the ozone layer and it's got to the ice, and the ice is melted.
And the sea level's rised, and then it's flooded.
And Antarctica's just water.
And so, all the penguins have gone?
- Yeah.
- That's why you put an X over them?
Yeah. lt is going to be very, very, very, very, very, very, very times a hundred much warmer than now.
- lt's just gonna be water.
- This is gonna be water all over.
Yeah, it's just--
There's just gonna be nothing.
- Just the sea.
- And where are we gonna live?
Nowhere.
- When do you think this is gonna happen?
- You never know. lt might just happen today.
- So that's actually pretty scary.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- ls that something that keeps you awake?
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
And l pray a lot in the night, before l go to bed and stuff. ln many ways, fear has been ruling the climate debate.
This is one picture which summarizes how a lot of people see global warming, as this all-ending catastrophe.
The tagline of Al Gore's film is
''This is the most terrifying film you'll ever see.'' lt was designed to scare you.
The actual lPCC numbers wouldn't scare you.
So, they produced pictures that would scare you.
Even at the 15th United Nation
Climate Conference in Copenhagen, the opening video set a fearful tone.
Representing this issue in catastrophizing language, the way that Al Gore and others have done, is a perfectly understandable political gambit.
Because if you want to get people's attention on a complex issue, you scare the pants off them. lt's a way of life for a huge number of my friends, and it's important for their livelihood to keep people scared.
Excellent scientists and international bureaucrats and huge numbers of people traveling around the world going to meetings, it is a danger.
The ideology of global warming is pushed in a certain direction by economic forces.
Americans live in about the safest times in human history and about the safest place in human history.
And yet, there are all these fears and scares around, and they're all blown out of proportion.
First, you duck.
Then, you cover.
Concern is growing at airports that SARS is a threat.
At Don's gun sale, business is very, very good, thanks to the Y2K fear. lf you want to make a lot of money, or if you want to make a reputation in America, especially as a politician, a great way to do it is to scare people. lf they're afraid, they'll vote for you.
They'll buy your products. lt's a very effective strategy. ln the descent to an ice age, one severe winter would follow another.
Eventually, the snows of Buffalo would never melt.
You have to say to yourself if it sounds like it's out of a movie or scarier than it should be, there's something wrong here.
Certainly when l was at school, there was a reasonable amount of media coverage of ideas that we were about to descend into a new ice age.
And l lead a group that's looking at the effects of ice sheets on future sea level change.
Predicting natural systems and how they'll change in the future is actually really difficult.
Because it's essentially almost non-scientific.
This problem is so complicated, it's very difficult for individuals, for media, or for governments to fathom it.
Dr. Stephen Schneider is a climatologist from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ln 1970, we didn't know whether dust and smoke pollution which was gonna cool the climate was gonna win out over greenhouse gases. l underestimated the strength of the CO2 and said cooling was gonna win. lt was a mistake.
Science never proves truth.
Therefore, when people say,
''Let's make a science of it,'' meaning making it exact, that is exactly the opposite of science.
So how do you know how to separate out who's giving you the straight story and who isn't? l think the best information, and l think most people would argue that, comes from the UN Climate Panel, the so-called lPCC. lt's by far the most widely accepted source of information on climate.
That doesn't mean it's perfect, as we've also seen, and l think many of you have heard that there are problems in some of the reports.
But fundamentally, the UN Climate Panel is the best source of information that we have, and it does tell us global warming's real, it's man-made, it is an important problem. l view lPCC as my pro-bono day job. lt takes up half my life and they don't pay me.
Many good scientists, thousands of scientists, are involved in this.
So l think it does a good job of summarizing the general knowledge.
We just have to tell them everything we know and the single most important thing is we have to tell them how likely it is.
As a scientist, l've been trained to talk about things l can test.
And then l'm being asked to give projections as to sea level rise, ice sheet change over the next 200 years.
Clearly, l can't test that.
Some scientists are very conservative and say we shouldn't say anything till we're sure, others say no, we have to warn society.
The evidence for alarm is virtually nonexistent.
Well, we know that CO2 is going up very fast.
What effect it has on temperature we don't know so well. l can't be certain that we're gonna warm up 4 or 6 degrees any more than l can be certain that we're gonna be lucky and only warm up 1 or 2. lt's a bell curve.
Scientists have come up with a range of global outcomes for climate change.
Very few expect it to have little or no impact.
Likewise, very few see it leading to massive catastrophe.
The vast majority of scientists think the ultimate outcome will fall somewhere in the middle, between those two extremes.
We scientists, we say, well, there's evidence for this, but on the other hand, we don't know about this.
That's what the truth is to us. lt's the whole picture.
On the other hand, how you gonna do the whole picture in five seconds on the evening news or five minutes in front of the U.S. Congress?
The truth about the coming climate catastrophe and our last chance to save humanity.
Happy holidays. l think it's very dangerous.
We're scared all the time. l do want to do something about the problem, but not going to solve anything if l'm just scared.
Everybody's discussing what to do, but nobody's doing anything, and l just-- l can't listen to all that anymore. l'm so tired of it. lf you scare people to motivate them, and things don't turn out the way you predict, over time they turn off.
You lose them.
The lnconvenient Truth did a big service for the community. lt brought an awareness.
However, it was probably more for getting a message across than being scientifically accurate.
Al Gore's film, that's a brilliant film and full of lovely things, but the only problem is that a lot of it isn't true, and a lot of it that is true is misinterpreted. lt's a great piece of propaganda.
There's this one quote from Al Gore's website for his film where he says we have just ten years to avert a major catastrophe that could send our entire planet into a tailspin of epic destruction involving extreme weather, floods, droughts, epidemics, and killer heat waves beyond anything we've ever experienced.
Let me just take you through four of those points.
But l want to focus on West Antarctica. lf this were to go, sea level worldwide would go up 20 feet.
Greenland would also raise sea level almost 20 feet if it went.
Twenty feet of sea level rise.
We see Florida, Holland,
San Francisco Bay Area,
Shanghai, Beijing, and New York City, and obviously it seems terrible.
But if it's not the true number, what is that except for scaring the pants off of people? l certainly don't support outlandish projections of either climate change or sea level rise.
Neither Greenland nor Antarctica in my opinion is threatened with complete extinction in the next 1 ,000 years,
2,000, 10,000 years.
With satellite data coming in, we've been able to establish a few very large areas that are losing ice into the ocean. lf all of this was to go?
Yeah, if all of this section were to go, the fastest-moving glaciers in that area have about
80 centimeters of sea level rise tied up in them.
And that's one of the things that you are concerned about.
Yes. But the most rapid rates that people are talking about, perhaps five meters in a century or two centuries, are really pretty unrealistic.
The UN Climate Panel estimate somewhere between 18 and 59 centimeters, most likely probably around 30 centimeters, about one foot.
How big of a problem is that?
Well, we actually know.
Because over the last 150 years, sea levels rose about a foot.
Yet did anyone notice? lmagine asking a very old person who lived through most of the 20th century, likely to be a woman, and ask her what were the important things that happened in the 20th century.
She'll talk about the World Wars, the suffrage for women, maybe even the lT revolution.
But it's very unlikely that she'll go,
''And sea levels rose.'' Right? lt underscores the fact that sea levels rising is a problem, it's a cost that we'll have to incur, but it's something that our much poorer forefathers handled very well, and that we are also likely to handle at fairly low cost.
Al Gore talks about hurricanes. l would argue that Katrina put global warming in the minds of many Americans. lf you remember, the Al Gore film poster was actually a smokestack with a hurricane coming out of it.
And of course, when the oceans get warmer, that causes stronger storms.
The statement that got a lot of people worked up was the notion that Hurricane Katrina was directly attributable to global warming.
As the water temperature increases, the wind velocity increases.
And you'll see Hurricane Katrina, as it comes into the Gulf, over that warm water, gets stronger and stronger. ln any kind of complex system, like the weather, you cannot attribute any particular event to any cause.
You just can't do that. lt's my opinion that global warming played no role in what happened with Hurricane Katrina.
That was completely a man-made cause disaster.
Not because of global warming, but because of having people live below sea level, coupled with, you know, an engineering failure, coupled with people not evacuating. lt was just a horrible event. lf you take a look at what we see here,
U.S. impacts from hurricanes from 1900 till 2009, the total cost in present-day dollars, there's no impact in the early part of last century, and only a tiny bit in the mid-century.
And here it escalates towards 2005, which was by far the biggest impact.
Clearly this seems to indicate global warming's getting worse and worse, and it's impacting hurricanes, meaning we're gonna see increases that keep going up and up.
That's actually true.
But has very little to do with global warming.
This is Miami Beach in 1926. ls it fairly obvious that if a hurricane hits here, yes, we are going to have some damage, but probably not all that much, right?
Whereas, of course, if a hurricane was to hit in the same place in 2006, it would probably be more expensive.
What we are seeing here is not the impact of global warming. lt's the impact of many more people with much more stuff living closer to where hurricanes hit.
Another myth set up in An lnconvenient Truth regards malaria.
There are cities that were founded because they were just above the mosquito line. Nairobi is one.
Mr. Gore says that the malaria mosquitoes were below Nairobi, but that now they've moved up to Nairobi and of course it's an unhealthy place.
Well, this is absolute rubbish.
Malaria was a major problem in Nairobi when it was founded in 1899.
Malaria is extremely complicated, and taking one single factor and extrapolating that to disaster is nonsense. lt is slightly connected to heat.
We're expecting that because of increased temperatures from global warming, we will probably see an expansion of the area in which malaria is gonna be endemic.
And that probably means, if we take some of the best estimates, that we're gonna see about three percent more malaria by the end of the century because of global warming.
Malaria, it's a disease of poverty.
As poor countries get better off, malaria disappears. ln Southeast Asia now, malaria is relatively rare where it was really a problem in the past.
We won't change the problem until we change people's living conditions. lf you're rich, you don't get malaria, and even if you get malaria, you don't die from malaria. lf you're poor, you get malaria, in the third world, and you die from malaria. lf what we want to do is to leave this world a better place, why is it we're so focused on the 3 percent malaria in a hundred years, instead of the 97 percent which we could already fix right now?
Polar bears have become the icon of global warming.
Certainly, Al Gore was not above showing this cute, animated polar bear swimming away on an ocean with no ice. lt is true that as temperatures rise, we are gonna see less and eventually disappearing summer arctic ice.
That is gonna be a problem for polar bears.
But most of us probably don't recognize the fact that we've actually seen a dramatic increase in the global polar bear population over the last 50 years or so.
We estimate that by 1960, there were probably about 5,000 polar bears in the global population.
Today, it's probably around 22,000.
So it's been going up dramatically.
But much more importantly, if every country in the industrialized world implemented Kyoto and did it all the way through the century, it would probably save about one polar bear every year.
Yet, isn't it curious that nobody talks about the fact that every year we shoot polar bears.
And not just a few of them.
We actually shoot every year somewhere between 300 and 500 polar bears.
There's something fundamentally wrong about the idea of saying if you want to help polar bears, the right way to go about it is to cut carbon emissions. No. lf you want to help polar bears now, the right way to go about it is to stop shooting them.
Presumably, this is about making a better world. l understand that a lot of people, they want to show they care.
But it's not about feeling good about yourself. lt's about doing good. And that also means we need to be able to say when is something just fashionable and when is it actually rational?
More than 50,000 homes and businesses in the city will switch off their lights for an hour tonight.
Even McDonald's will turn off its golden arches.
The World Wildlife Fund estimated that two billion people, or about one in three people in the world, participated in this, they turned off their lights for one hour to show how much you care about the planet.
The problem is partly that it doesn't do anything. l mean, we can't even measure the reduction in emissions.
But it also teaches people, oh, hey, dealing with global warming's quite easy. l mean, l just have to turn off my light once, for one hour, once every year.
Also, if you think about it, most people, certainly the people l know, they light up candles instead. lt makes you feel good, right?
The problem is, of course, if you actually light two candles, you end up emitting more CO2 than what you save by turning off your lights.
Science has been hijacked by alarmists.
And the public are given to believe that they are to blame.
We only have one world, and it's a good idea to try to keep it from exploding into flames. lt starts with, like, the smallest things you can do.
We started washing our clothes with stones. l'm completely off electronics.
Now everybody's gotta, you know, go to Wal-Mart and get those little lamps and things like that.
You know, you can get an energy-efficient lightbulb today.
Recycle more, drive hybrids.
- l have a hybrid.
- l drive hybrid.
These are great things.
By all means, let's do them.
But let's not kid ourselves and believe that this is what's going to fix the problem. l'm wearing Alex J., and she's a newer designer that's making all eco-friendly, sustainable clothing.
Global warming has become the defining moral issue of our time. lt's not a fad. lt's not a boutique thing.
Do something about it.
Do something about it.
Even if everyone in the U.S. changed to Priuses, it would cut only about half a percentage point of what we need to cut by mid-century. lf everyone in the U.S. changed their lightbulbs to energy-saving lightbulbs, we would only cut...
...of what we need to cut by mid-century.
Well, this is the eco-driver, and each Friday, the eco-monitors have a look on the eco-drive and see if we're under a hundred kilowatts, and if we are, we win ten pounds.
Oh, this is May, June, July,
August, and September.
We did very badly in January. ln February, we were all right.
We did very badly in March.
Do you have your personal reading at home?
- Some of us do.
- l do it. l take my readings at home every night or every morning. l feel better when l get a low reading, because l know l'm doing something to help the environment.
When we get a high reading, we do try and find out why at home.
We try not to keep the lights on all the time.
When my dad did toast every morning, it used a similar amount to about a lightbulb.
- Yeah.
- So did he stop making toast?
What? No, he didn't stop eating toast.
The main problem with the solution that we're focusing on today, which is promise grand carbon cuts, is that we don't do them.
And there's a very simple reason why.
Because fundamentally, no one of us wants to stop flying or stop heating or cooling our homes or stop doing the many things that are made possible by fossil fuels.
What we need is technology that will make it cheaper for us to not emit carbon dioxide but still be able to do all these great things.
We need to find cheaper ways to have alternative energy.
Just as the world community joined together to create a space platform, that's what we need to do in energy.
On our home here, we have enough solar to meet our total energy demands on an average day.
What we're looking at here is one week's reported output from the solar panels on my roof.
And that's cool to look at, but it's even more interesting when the utility starts to buy power back.
And that's a week's worth of earnings, depending how l use my solar array.
Solar panels look great, cost a fortune.
They probably cost about ten times as much as fossil fuels.
And as long as this is the case, we're not going to get green energy going.
Wind energy is one of the most exciting sectors.
We've seen the scale of wind energy projects expand, so much so that everything from individual farmers who have discovered they can make more money renting space for a wind turbine than the crops on the land, but they can still grow the crops.
Now, l personally happen to think that wind turbines look beautiful.
But we still get what's called NlMBYism.
''Not in my backyard'' sorts of behaviors.
And part of that is just things that are new, are different, and are a challenge, but some of it is a wind turbine too close to one's home is not something you want.
On land, they take up space, they often inconvenience people.
But obviously, there's plenty of space that would inconvenience virtually no one if you put windmills out in the water.
The problem right now is that they still cost quite a bit more, simply because it's more problematic to put them up and it's more problematic to service them.
Renewable's been coming down in price about 50 percent per decade.
So a little bit like waiting for a computer, at some point you actually have to buy it.
And you can't just say it's gonna get better next year.
But on the other hand, you can also buy too early.
Denmark was a leader in wind technology, for instance.
What we did was, we put out way too many windmills way too soon, because we thought, you know, it was a cool thing to do.
The problem is, now we actually have to take all of them down.
Overall, that was a bad investment for Denmark.
Offshore wind projects like this were supposed to play a vital and growing role in filling Britain's energy needs.
The trouble is, the companies investing in them say they're now having trouble making the numbers add up.
What l think is really crucial is to come up with a smart way to start thinking about global warming. ln DC, we essentially asked some of the best economists in the world,
''What are the best ways to help the planet deal with climate change, what are the smart ideas, and what's the cost and what's the benefit?''
One of the most interesting technologies that we should be alert to and watching for...
The last thing we should be doing is acting as if it's a big problem and doing nothing.
This current
Copenhagen Consensus-- l hope what it does is focus some attention away from just carbon taxes and cap and trade as the only things we should be thinking about.
The only way that we're gonna fix climate change in the medium term-- by making sure not to make fossil fuels so expensive that nobody wants to buy it, but by making green energy technologies so cheap that everybody will want to buy them.
Part of the challenge of renewables isn't just how good the solar panel or the wind turbine is. lt's that it's not reliable all the time in the way we turn on a gas turbine.
So they're intermittent.
You have to use them when the grid is on, because we can't store energy. l would say that...
Solar power needs to be
24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Solar doesn't work like that.
So trying to get a storage mechanism is the big key.
So we've set on this path of using sunlight and inventing things that could mediate the sunlight and then store it in a chemical fuel.
And that's in water splitting-- hydrogen and oxygen. lf you take the MlT swimming pool and take only one-third of that water and split it to hydrogen and oxygen per second, you'll take care of our energy needs for the next half century.
The term we use to describe our process is ''artificial photosynthesis.''
Because it's really doing what a plant does. lt takes sunlight and splits water into hydrogen and oxygen.
Hydrogen and oxygen are fuels.
So you can take the hydrogen and the oxygen, put them in a fuel cell.
You can use batteries, but they don't store a lot of energy.
A fuel cell stores a hundred times a thousand more energy per weight than a battery.
And it also doesn't just have to work in pure water. lf somebody has a stream or dirty water supply, our catalyst can start splitting it when powered by a photovoltaic.
And then when it comes out of the fuel cell, you'll have clean drinking water.
The discovery we've had is so simple to implement.
We should be spending about a hundred billion dollars a year on research and development into green energy alternatives.
That'd be about 50 times more than what the world is spending today.
Even though funding of science has gone up, it's still a little drop in the bucket.
And if something doesn't happen within five years, l'll be very disappointed.
The United States is pumping waste water into the ocean right now to the tune of about...
We can grow a population of algae, like these green algae here,
Chlorella, in about ten days.
This is a typical NASA solution, right?
Where you find out one thing that's considered a waste product, and you say,
''Well, how can we use that as a resource rather than considering a waste?''
We're processing waste water.
And by the way, we're gonna be sequestering carbon dioxide, because the algae live on carbon dioxide in water.
We have a huge infrastructure based on fossil fuels.
Much of that material came from algae that lived millions and millions of years ago. lf we look at algae now as these single-celled organisms, many of the species produce huge amounts of oil that, if we could figure out how to harness that, then maybe we could solve the problem of liquid fuels.
The first ''A'' in ''NASA'' is for ''Aeronautics,'' and ''Space Administration.''
And in order to keep planes flying, we're gonna have to develop some alternative fuels.
NASA's been working hard on optimizing sort of very efficient aircraft.
But the fuels-- lf we can change the fuels so we're using a carbon neutral fuel, it'll have a huge impact on our ability to fly airplanes.
We would still need on the order of 10.5 million acres to be able to grow enough fuel to replace the fuel that we're currently using for aviation, for example.
Now, 10.5 million acres sounds like a huge area, but it's an area 128 miles by 128 miles.
So it really isn't that far-fetched that we would be able to do something like this.
This idea that we don't mine our energy anymore--
We don't bring it out of the deep earth and burn it up and put it back in the atmosphere.
We start using our, quote, unquote,
''waste materials,'' to create energy.
Our basic idea was to reinvent nuclear power. ln particular, we wanted to come up with a energy source that you could credibly scale to give everyone on the planet
U.S. levels of energy consumption.
As a developing world develops, they are going to need to have it.
So that's a pretty tall task.
But that is the task that l think we need to solve over the course of this next century.
This is a model of our nuclear reactor-- our terra power reactor.
The difference is with ours is that we can fuel this entirely with waste.
We can solve the nuclear waste problem.
Because this fourth generation nuclear power plant can burn this nuclear waste and produce waste that has a half-life of more like a couple of decades, so that after 100, 150 years, its radioactivity is small.
The beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal.
The potential is almost in a class of its own.
Do we know if it works?
We have high confidence that it works.
You know, until we build a test reactor, you can't know for sure.
Nuclear has the potential to be a major player. lt's already a fifth of our energy economy.
The question is, can we build a next generation of plants at scale affordably?
And we don't know that yet.
What do we think about the cost?
Because obviously, nuclear power works, but it's also pretty costly.
We believe that we can make these at a price that's competitive for coal. lf you can make something that's cost competitive to coal--
- You've won.
- And we think this can. ln the case of the United Kingdom, we are an island surrounded by the ocean.
So wave power is a spectacularly untapped source of renewable energy.
- So that's the new bridge.
- Yes. l was looking for technology that would work in the winter in Scotland where our solar input is not very good.
And waves looked to be quite an interesting way of doing it. l think the key inspiration to this was when l wrote that the transmission of energy from one wave to the next was incredibly efficient.
And so what l wanted to do was to find a way to make the wave think that it was just driving another wave when it was really driving my machine.
And this silly little bit of balsa wood, driving a gadget with magnets and coils and things, was able to get about 90 percent of the energy out of the waves simply by trying to mimic a wave.
We made 60 of these and tested them, and they work really quite nicely.
Why don't we have Salter's Duck in the Western approaches?
The answer is that when that technology was being assessed, the assessment task was given to the atomic energy authority, which is a little bit like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank.
The decision to shut it was because it was looking as if it might actually be viable.
At that stage, they were desperate to make the economic case to build new nuclear power stations which, at that time, was much harder than it is today. l got sent minutes of meetings that l was clearly not meant to get.
What happened was that in the assessment, an assumption was put in that that undersea electrical cable which, we are told by the electrical industry is a very reliable type of cable, was assumed to break not once in a thousand years, but once in 10, 20.
They were withholding some reports and changing numbers in other reports.
We wasted 35 years now.
And this a good example of why we need to have coherent science-led policy.
You'd think that this would be something that the government would target lots of research money for.
They don't.
We're talking in large part about changing the type of energy we use and how we use it, which means we're talking about changing very big business in very big ways, and that's tough.
The energy infrastructure is a mature industry.
No one has come up with a brand-new energy source in a very long time.
Almost every one of us knows or has heard of some billionaire who made his or her billions in the fossil fuel world, and yet none of us can name a billionaire who made their money in the solar world or in the wind world.
Because while these technologies are all really appealing, they haven't generated the kind of industrial base and the kind of wealth yet that allows their proponents to say, ''This is as good an economic engine as the fossil fuel one.''
The question of transforming the whole world economy to change from coal to oil, which was happening when l was a child, took about 50 years.
And now change from oil to solar will probably take 50 years.
We need a big commitment to what's called adaptation, which means reducing people's vulnerability to climate impacts around the world.
Adaptation is just realizing that we have an environment that keeps on changing, as it always has been, and we have to adapt to it. lf you look at human ingenuity, human society, men are actually very good at adapting. lt's an old statement. We know how to come in from out of the rain.
A combination of melted heavy winter snows, ice jams and swelling streams in the annual battle against
Mother Nature's tantrum.
We have adapted to many things.
We have developed home heating, air conditioning.
There's people living on the equator, there's people living on the North Pole, and they all get by.
So that means that then we can adapt to basically anything. lf the sea level's gonna go up a foot or less, we can probably adapt to it.
Sandbags were also stockpiled along the river dikes and flooded areas.
Dikes have been used in Holland for centuries.
When l fly into Holland, it seems like you're precariously close to water level.
You're looking here at probably one of the most vulnerable systems.
And this is Rotterdam, one of the biggest ports in Europe.
Yeah. Also, we need to find solutions.
How do deal with a system where the urbanization is so close to the river.
So what we're going to do is we're going to close off from all sides with barriers that can close when there is high water.
We're nearing the storm-surge barrier--
Maeslant Barrier.
These arms don't look that big from this perspective, but actually, each one of them is the size of the Eiffel Tower.
That's amazing.
So this basically safeguards some of the most valuable land in Holland.
Yeah, probably the most valuable in economic terms.
So it's crucial.
One of the ways the Dutch are protecting themselves against flooding is by dredging the ocean and expanding their coastline.
So, essentially, this is the North Sea that you're trying to protect
Holland from.
- Right. Right.
- All of this area didn't exist just half a year ago.
- Correct.
- And we basically created that to safeguard the houses that we see down there.
- Houses that are below sea level really.
- Yeah.
Well, you feel pretty safe now knowing that this is in front of your low-lying area.
This is essentially what you're holding out to the world to say that we can do this well, and we can do this fairly cheap. l mean, at 0. 1 percent of GDP, you can basically safeguard all of Holland.
But Holland wasn't always so fortified. ln 1953, a massive storm hit and killed thousands of people.
With over 60 percent of its population living below sea level, this terrible event got the Dutch seriously thinking about comprehensive flood control.
A similar wake-up call came to New Orleans in 2005.
This section of levee-- about 300 feet of it-- failed.
The wall actually collapsed.
And all the houses in this area were totally swept out for about four or five blocks.
During Katrina, this wall was at 12 feet in elevation, and as built, was one and a half feet too low.
Over 1 ,800 people perished,
400,000 lost their homes, and all of that because of the failure of the federal government levee system.
This was a manmade catastrophe.
This didn't reflect global warming. lt didn't reflect that Hurricane Katrina was a super-duper hurricane.
Katrina mussed us.
We need to build decent levees, something like the Dutch.
The Dutch give
1 in 10,000 year protection.
We have 1 in 30 year protection here.
Well, as a result of being involved in this, l lost my job at Louisiana State University.
- He got fired?
- Yes. l didn't know that.
- Actually, he got fired?
- Yes. l was afraid for it.
Everybody loved us until we said,
''Ah, the levees failed because they were badly designed.''
Suppose New Orleans is hit again by a hurricane?
Should we rebuild it?
Do we rebuild cities below sea level, or do we move them?
The mission for us is to build a cradle to cradle inspired home, to build 150 homes here in the Lower Ninth Ward and show people how they can build green effectively and function as a catalyst to bring everybody home to the Lower Ninth Ward.
So there are large steel poles embedded within the front and the back of this home. ln the event the home were to actually float, the home itself would just ride up, and this would stay stationary.
We can fix the flood protection system, as Dr. Van Heerden always tells us.
We can have a comprehensive system with wetlands and barriers and flood gates.
All the things that the Dutch have in their system.
America can do this.
We have the technology.
The question is, do we have the will and the commitment to do it?
Most people around the world live in urban areas.
We're estimating more than 50 percent right now. lt'll probably be somewhere between 80 and 90 percent towards the end of the century.
Urban areas are much, much warmer than their surrounding countrysides.
Why? Because there's no water, there's no greenery, and there's lots of black surfaces like asphalt.
Last week, the government said a staggering
1 1 ,435 people died in the August heat wave.
Far beyond initial estimates.
The city we see out here is a city where we will see more and more heat waves and more and more heat deaths.
Yes. But we can do something about it smartly, simply, if we focus on cheap ways to, for instance, make this city cooler.
One of the many ways that you can combat this global warming problem is to reduce the amount of energy absorbed by the Earth.
Simplest way to do that is to paint the world white.
We can reflect some of the sun's energy back into space and actually combat the problem.
The cities are warming at a rate of about 1 degree Fahrenheit every decade.
This is an example of an area that as far as your eyes see, there are rooftops and paved surfaces.
So, what do we have to do to make Los Angeles cooler?
White roofs for flat roofs, cool-colored roofs for sloped roofs, plenty of shade trees, and cool-colored pavements.
- 5 degrees--
- That would reduce the temperature by as much about 5 degrees.
This particular driveway is actually made from what's called pervious, or porous concrete, as commonly called.
The water actually goes through this concrete.
And it's a lighter color as compared to asphalt.
We can decrease the heat island effect of this compared to asphalt by almost 29 percent.
For very little money, we could actually make virtually all cities in the world very, very cool.
Absolutely. l think that's a no-brainer.
You save air conditioning, you improve comfort, and you cool the globe.
Yeah. What is there not to like?
We can do this.
We could actually, for about 1 billion dollars, once make Los Angeles cooler than global warming will make it warmer throughout this century.
This is not a perfect solution for everything, but it's certainly a great start.
What if we get this kind of sudden, highly destructive climate change? lf that scenario were to play out, the only possible response would be climate engineering. lt's the only way to stop warming rapidly. lf you have a heroin addict, what's the best way to cure them?
Methadone, right? lt's a palliative.
So we are addicted to carbon.
We don't seem to be able to get off it.
We may have to have some palliative to try to temporarily get out of it. l have always personally supported research in geo-engineering, because we may, unfortunately, at one stage, need planetary methadone, because we can't get un-addicted from carbon fuel.
People have viewed geo-engineering as a crazy sci-fi idea.
Something you might talk about, but, come on, you'd never really do it.
We started doing geo-engineering
5,000 years ago when we started plowing.
We have done a lot of geo-engineering.
We have cut down forests.
That's exactly what we do when we burn carbon.
We're emitting things that are changing the climate of Earth.
We've already changed climate to make it warmer by putting out carbon dioxide.
We didn't do that on purpose.
But possibly we could do some things on purpose to make the world cooler. ln 1 783, a volcano in lceland erupts.
A volcano called Laki.
A horrible catastrophe for lceland. lt kills 25 percent of the population, and it causes the winter of 1 784 in Europe to be terrible.
Well, Benjamin Franklin is living in Europe as a diplomat.
He thinks about it, figures it out, and in 1 784, gives a paper that says,
''l know what the weather was caused by.
The volcano blocked the many rays of the sun.''
Now, Ben Franklin's idea got a very good empirical test in 1991 .
Daybreak in Mount Pinatubo bursts angrily into life again.
Mount Pinatubo was a very large volcano. lt put the dust and, particularly, sulfur dioxide, very high in the atmosphere, into the stratosphere. ln fact, it cooled the Earth.
Benjamin Franklin and Mount Pinatubo are the two great inspirations for the one thrust in geo-engineering, which is to say, if we can go and make an artificial volcano, that would be good enough to solve the problem.
And we could do it quickly.
This is not something that takes 100 years to ramp up.
Mount Pinatubo, you know, did it in a long weekend.
Our basic idea was, let's get this stuff up into the stratosphere the cheapest controlled way that we can.
Our current design involves a hose that has lots of little pumps. lt turns out, these are actual balloons, made by a company called
JP Aerospace, that they've put up this high.
So that part works.
As we zoom out, we see, boy, we're a long way up.
- How far up are you?
- 25 kilometers.
- 15 miles--
- That's up to the stratosphere.
So if we look then down at the bottom of this, we have the facility down at the bottom where we pump the stuff up and we have a pile of sulfur out the back that we turn into it. ln our most efficient scheme, it's a hose about this big around.
One hose this big around could do an entire hemisphere.
You'd need one in the north, one in the south.
And what's gonna be the cost of this?
Well, we think this could be tested for tens of millions of dollars and deployed for hundreds of millions. lt's a balloon and a facility, but it's really nothing compared to the size of the problems that people say will occur if global warming gets out of control.
And, of course, nothing compared to what we're otherwise thinking of spending in terms of hundreds of billions and possibly even trillions of dollars.
And we think this is hundreds of millions, so it's vastly smaller. ln fact, so much smaller that if l'm off by a factor of 100,
- it's still cheap.
- You're still good. Yeah.
The R&D funding we asked for--
750 million per year for ten years.
The potential net benefits are 18 trillion, so we're asking for .06 percent of the potential benefits to spend on R&D.
The same engineer who pioneered wave energy has designed the boats to deploy what the Copenhagen
Consensus found to be the most cost-efficient geo-engineering solution-- cloud brightening.
My contribution at the moment is making clouds just a tiny little bit whiter. lf you have a large number of small drops, you get a white cloud, and if you have a small number of big drops, you get a darker cloud.
Those ones are 4 millimeters in diameter, and those ones are a hundred times smaller.
And a chap called John Latham had the idea that if you could give the air in the mid-oceans more condensation nuclei, than you'd get whiter clouds, and this would reflect more solar energy back out to space.
So this is essentially a sail.
This is doing the job of a sail, all without hemming.
The ships are fueled entirely by the wind.
They're sailing ships.
By spraying sea water up into the air, you could actually make the clouds denser.
Only slightly denser. You couldn't even see it with your naked eye.
But it's enough denser that that could cause enough light to reflect back into space, and you could cool the earth.
And how much would this kind of thing cost?
Between one and a half and three million dollars each.
So let's say we wanted 300 ships at two million each.
That's 600 million dollars.
Once they're built, they're not using any new fossil fuels at all.
There's other approaches to geo-engineering.
You can try to suck the CO2 or other greenhouse gases right out of the sky.
This is to the earth what liposuction is in plastic surgery.
Plantations on degraded lands-- what we call biochar algae.
There is a way of slowing sea level rise down, which is to pump water from the sea onto this ice shelf.
Use snow-blowing machines to create a thickening ice shelf.
This is a brilliant idea about how to tie up a lot of carbon in the soil-- what we call regenerative grazing. lf we would take all the land that's not being used for food, we could plant a trillion trees and stop the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for about 50 years or so.
Obviously, Al Gore has been a big influence in this whole discussion, and--
Well, he's not very keen on geo-engineering yet.
The last thing he said about it was that it was nuts.
And l don't think nuts is right. l hope we don't need it,
- but l feel we might.
- Yeah.
Maybe he's thinking it will give us an excuse not to go over to renewables.
You have to watch out for the moral hazard.
A moral hazard means you tell people,
''Oh, don't worry. We've got this little
''back-pocket solution called geo-engineering,
''so we don't have to do anything now.
We can always use it later.''
That's not true.
This is a way to bide time. lt's not a permanent solution.
We still have to find ways of generating energy in a much better way.
Geo-engineering is to the climate issue what stem cell research is to the health issue. lt does make the politics that much more complicated, because there is a sizable fraction of the environmental community who will say no.
We're not ready to deploy these technologies, but they're promising enough that, to me, they seem well worth investing the R&D money to develop them further.
Some folks will say, ''Look,
''this technology got us here in the first place.
You guys are only gonna screw things up worse.''
And l think the appropriate answer is to say, ''Okay, what's your solution?''
Don't stop me if you don't have a solution of your own.
Our economics is gonna have to evolve, meaning we're gonna have to reflect our values in our currency.
The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.
And the Oil Age isn't going to end until we figure out something that's a cheaper, better alternative.
1906, Wilbur and Orville Wright flew their little plane off a sand dune.
And within 60 years, we had a person in orbit around the planet. l mean, this is amazing.
And then, nine years later, we had someone walking on the moon.
When we put our minds to things and when we invest, we can do amazing things.
And l'm very optimistic that we're gonna be able to make this transition.
The message that Al Gore forgot to tell everybody is there's a lot of scientists and engineers all over the world that are totally energized.
We're gonna do it. We will do it.
So the lnconvenient Truth only got you halfway there.
They forgot to give you the solution.
The solution is us.
Al Gore talks about global warming as our generational mission.
What's gonna be our legacy?
He asks each and every one of us,
''How do you want to be remembered by your kids and grandkids?''
The surprising thing is that many, many well-meaning people, many of my good friends, but certainly also many world leaders around this world, seem to want to be remembered for spending lots and lots of money doing virtually no good. l just don't think that our kids and grandkids are gonna say,
''Great going there, Granddad,'' when we could've done so much more good.
We can do it for the same amount of money that the EU is proposing to spend on doing no good
100 years from now.
So the budget is about
250 billion dollars per year.
Climate.
100 billion dollars on research and development into green energy. lt's basically to make sure that we find long-term solutions to deal with climate change.
At the same time, we also need to have a stopgap measure if things turn out to be much worse than what we expected, and/or if we need some extra time in order to be able to phase in the green energy.
That's where the Nobel laureates propose that we should be spending 1 billion dollars in research and development into geo-engineering.
We can tackle the global warming impacts by focusing on sea level rise--
30 billion dollars.
On inland flooding-- about 6 billion dollars.
And urban heat islands-- that is where most people will be living by the end of the century-- for about 12 billion dollars.
And we can solve all the major remaining problems in the world.
We could tackle health problems.
We could tackle hunger.
We can tackle lack of water and sanitation.
And then, lastly, we would be spending
22 billion on education, making sure that everybody can read and write, and enable them not only to participate in the global economy, but also participate in democracies and elect their own leaders and be influential in the decisions that are gonna shape their future.
And the total price would be about
250 billion dollars per year.
Or do we want to spend
250 billion dollars on the current approach, which is gonna reduce temperatures by 1/10 of 1 degree
Fahrenheit by the end of the century. ls that really better than dealing with all these problems, both with climate change, adaptation, and all the other problems?
The point here is, why aren't we doing it?
Why aren't we focusing on this? l think l understand your point.
Now, maybe Denmark, with all due respect, is incapable of dealing with those things.
But l'll tell you something about America.
We are capable of dealing with HlV, malaria, and the commitment to our grandkids to not just spoil this planet, because it is a moral obligation to do all three.
And we're going to do all three in this country.
You want to make any comment, go ahead. l will just really make two points.
One is you say America is a great country.
And it's absolutely a great country, and it's definitely much bigger than Denmark.
You say also that you will deal with both malaria,
HlV, and global warming, and, you know, we could add on a few others like clean drinking water and education, and all the problems in the world. l'm very happy to hear that. l would, however, ask respectfully why you didn't do so the last ten years?
Why haven't you solved all these problems?
If anyone does not know this place:
It is the Kingdom of Ling, the centre of the world.
If anyone does not know me:
I am Ma Nene Karmo.
I live in the blue turquoise palace in the divine paradise.
You appeared in this world where there is so much sorrow and hate.
The people hunt the animals.
They kill and eat them.
The people catch the fish with iron hooks.
When you destroyyour enemies, the gods and Padmasambhava take them to the Kingdom of Heaven.
I, Ma Nene Karmo, always feel compassion for living creatures and never hate for them.
Brahma also always feels compassion for living creatures and never hate for them.
You have to subjugate the 1 8 kingdoms ofthe demons and all their other domains
Collect the treasures for Ling and spread the teachings of Buddha.
You must go to the underworld.
When you get there, beware of the boar-headed and the dog-headed spirits.
Furthermore, you will also find the cold hell and the hot hell there.
There, too, is a bottomless river.
Onlyyou and your horse can cross this river.
Midshung, Drugmo and Pekar Lhatse are personifications of the goddess Tara.
They appear in the world to save the living creatures.
I, Ma Nene Karmo, work in the upperworld of the gods, in the middle world of Ngen, in the lower world of the water spirits.
I work forthem all and do not remain idle.
You, too, must be active.
Do not stay here long.
Go to the underworld to save the living creatures.
You must pass judgement on what is good and what is bad.
Follow the white light and go to the underworld.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
In this way Ma Nene Karmo sang about the work of Drugmo in theworld, about King Gesar's descent into hell and about his horse.
From the victorious golden throne
King Gesar, the heavenly ruler, the earth's tree of life, looked upon the assembly with loving and watchful eyes.
All the fathers and mothers, sons and daughters of Ling offered their adoration and good wishes to the King.
Theyjoyfully sang old songs and performed propitious dances.
They drank tea and barley beer in a festive mood.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
Is the 24th a Friday?.
It is a Friday!.
All right then.
On that daywe bring burnt offerings.
Yes, burnt offerings and prayers.
Margen, is Monday your neutral day?.
Yes.
Is Monday a good day?.
Yes, it is a lucky as well as a neutral day.
Then let's set out on Monday!.
It's the right time ifit's a neutral day.
A neutral day is good!
Yes, it is.
Leave on Monday and celebrate the preparation feast on Friday?.
Yes, dear, that's what we'll do.
Friday is Margen's most favourable day.
And the element water is available twice over.
It is an excellent day for the preparation.
Yes, my dear.
Let us also play equestrian games, so that all the lucky signs agree.
Zopon's horse will have to show what it can do.
That remains to be seen!
Kiang or these two horses will win!
Kiang must do his best; ifhe loses, he's lost his chance!
Ifhe loses, he is finished.
But we are betting on him.
...Nextyear at this same time, maywe all bejoyfully reunited.
Maythere be peace in theworld.
May all beings know of Buddha's teachings.
May all the tutelary gods protect us.
May H.H. the Dalai Lama live long and maywe soon meet him...
This is our salt.
That's what our 4 men are going to bring from Lake Tsentso this year.
I don't know ifwe'll find salt there.
They say there are many salt lakes.
Lorries collect the salt mostly from other lakes, butyak caravans go to Lake Tsentso.
Whoever has been to Lake Tsentso will go there again.
We exchange salt for grain.
This year the price of salt is very low.
So we have to keep it for the time being.
Ifthe price goes up, it's good for us.
Ifit stays low, we can't do anything.
It isn't easy to keepyaks.
Fetching salt with yaks is hard work, and then the price for the salt in no way pays us for our effort.
When the salt was worth more, we would exchange it for barley.
But nowadays the value has gone down.
So we have to sell ouryaks to get barley.
Without salt we nomads have no barley either.
Is the Gomshe family sending fouryaks?.
No, threeyaks.
Then we have a total of 1 60 yaks,
40 yaks per man?.
-Three from you?.
-Yes, three.
And 21, that makes 1 60 yaks altogether!
Who is the sheep from?.
It's from Margen.
Margen - The Old Mother
I have a lot of experience because I've been fetching salt for manyyears.
So I can show the others the way and explain to them how it's done.
And besides, I'm the oldest.
Ifwe're in a hurry,
I quickly make some simple tea.
But ifwe have time,
I make real strong butter tea and we have a rest.
That's Margen's work.
I was Margen for manyyears, and they all want me as Margen again.
Margen wishes you all good luck!
Thank you for your wishes, all the best!
Pargen - The Old Father
Is it already 4 o'clock?.
Ifit's alreadyfour, we can gradually start the horse racing.
Yes, we'll soon go outside.
Pargen's best wishes for all of you!
We thankyou foryourwishes. Good luck!
Bopsa is the favourite son ofthe salt men, so they say anyway.
Ah yes.
The favourite son??!.
Oyes, each one of us has a position.
Yes, you each have your position.
One is the Old Mother, one the Old Father and one is Lord of the Animals and one the novice!
Zopon - The Lord of the Animals
The Lord of the Animals wishes good luck!
Thankyou.
Long life and success!
Dear Bopsa, have another!
You're like our only son.
Bopsa - The Novice
Bopsa wishes you all good luck!
Yes, thankyou!
Bopsa's nose quivers when he drinks!
They say that in the olden days a woman once went to the salt lake to get salt.
She was so greedy that she took an awful lot of salt and stuffed it all into her trousers.
That upset the salt lake and made it angry.
Since then women are no longer allowed to go to the salt lake.
That's what people say.
There is a salt language.
But the salt men say that they aren't allowed to use this language in the presence of women.
Women don't go to the salt lake, they aren't allowed to.
I don't know why.
In all my more than 70 years I have never heard ofa woman fetching salt.
There must be some reason for it.
Women don't even turn their faces in that direction.
When my son goes to the salt lake as Lord ofthe Animals I worry a bit about him catching a cold and about other small things.
Otherwise I'm notworried because he really is strong enough and can go on the journey.
People say ifa woman goes to the salt lake the salt disappears, women don't get it.
The reason for this may be because women are different from birth, they are different from men.
The first time I was Bopsa it wasn't very difficult because I had an older man at my side.
That time we went to Lake Biru.
Later on we nearly always went to Tsentso, where my grandson goes now. But there we usually had trouble because ofthe mud.
With the heavy salt sacks on our backs we often sank deep into the muddy ground.
It was hard work.
I and Derma, we fight as equals for the Kingdom Ling.
This has been determined by the gods.
We must ride toJang and take possession of the twelve precious salt lakes.
It is time now to conquer the eighty demonic warriors ofJang.
Margen means that I prepare tea and other things for all of us, as a mother does for her family.
Pargen stands for father.
Pargen and Margen take on the roles offather and mother.
Pargen's jobs are to make burnt offerings, to distribute the meat, to prepare the dumpling soup, and if something has to be discussed, to go to other tents.
There is an old story about the different kinds ofwood:
One day the woods spoke to each other about having to go into the fire ofthe salt men the next day.
All the woods said:
I don't want to go,
I don't want to,
I don't want to go!
But then one wood called Wodu came forward and said:
I shall go by hiding myself under the ground.
Wodu wood is yellowish and only grows under the ground.
When it rains it is difficult to find dung to make a firewith.
But luckily it hardly ever rains at this time of the year.
The journey to Tsentso takes a month and a day or two more.
Ifwewalkfast, it takes just a month.
In the past we used to meet other people almost every day, but nowadays far fewer people live here.
Many days we don't meet even a single soul.
There used to be many tents and many herds.
We even had the problem ofthe animals getting mixed up, so that we kept having to look for them.
Once we get beyond the 'stone goat' behind the pass, we have to start following the rules.
They must be obeyed as from this point.
Even when we are sitting in the tent, each one of us has to take up the right position.
And we are by no means allowed to use bad words.
After passing the "stone goat" we also speak the salt language.
Whateverwe do now, we must obey the rules.
It's the first time for Bopsa.
He's a novice here and is initiated into it like a monk who is entering a monastery.
That's why he also brings us butter and tea as presents.
Everything is new to Bopsa, so we older ones have to show him everything for him to learn.
Today is the day that he is admitted to our community.
As from the Bopsa ceremony he will really belong to the salt men.
We call him Bopsa because there are many things he still can't do.
Whatever he does, he lacks experience.
Nothing works without experience,
Iike this he won't achieve anything.
At the salt lake he has to learn how to extract salt, how deep you're allowed to scrape, how to handle the tools, all kinds oftricks.
And how to carry the sacks, but here it depends on whether he is strong enough.
May the gods be with us on the way there and receive us on the way back.
Hail to the gods and the water spirits.
Protect us from all evil!
The Lamas, meditation gods, sacrificial goddesses, tutelary gods, enemyvanquishers, local gods, the lord ofthe area and all his servants, may they all come and accept the burnt offerings and ablutions.
The gods ofwisdom, the gods ofactivity, the gods of magic power, the Lamas and Tantrics, the earthly tutelary deities, the wish-fulfilling gods ofthe treasure,
Jambhala with all his servants, maythey all accept the offering and make riches fall upon us like rain.
Whereveryou gods appear, may mywishes be fulfilled, obstacles be overcome, illnesses be cured and all negative influences be kept away from me.
May the banners ofbliss rise in all ten directions.
May the lords of the areas, the water spirits, the Ngen, the gods ofthe country, the local gods with their servants, who live in all worlds and in this place, appear and accept the offering.
May the Lamas ofthe three bodies, the Lamas of the three traditions, the peaceful and wrathful deities, the three jewels, the sacrificial goddesses, the gods and guardians of the treasure and all higher creatures accept the pure alcohol offering and fulfil mywishes.
The Earth, the flowers and plants on it, the four continents and Mount Meru, adorned with the sun and the moon,
I shall take them to Buddha as an offering.
May all living creatures be reincarnated in the perfect world.
Good fortune and blessing!
May all you do be successful!
With other salt men we speak only the salt language.
If e.g. at the salt lake someone from our tent meets someone from the neighbouring tent, they speak the salt language.
Anyone who can't speak the salt language isn't respected, especially ifit is an older man.
One thinks badly of someone like that.
The salt language is the salt men's secret language.
When we meet non-nomads we don't use a single word of it.
And especially when women are there we keep the salt language absolutely secret.
We've got that from our forefathers.
That's all I know.
The caravan consists of two parts.
We call the front one Bobyak.
It goes on ahead with the luggage and takes it to the next camp.
The remaining yaks are led by the Lord ofthe Animals to good pastures where he lets them graze in peace.
Where there isn't good grass, he makes them walk faster.
The Bobyak has to be exchanged every day because some ofthese yaks get weak from carrying loads.
That's whywe exchange them and let the others do the carrying.
Where there is good grass
I let the animals walk slowly, and where there is little grass
I drive them a bit.
While the other men go on ahead to the next camp,
I look after the animals.
I make myself some tea, that's all.
In the evening I try to reach the camp with the animals.
At the salt lake, when the others have finished preparing the salt, they send me a message to bring theyaks.
As soon as I get there
I check the saddles and yak carpets.
That's myjob as Zopon, as Lord ofthe Animals.
Doyou live down there?.
Yes, I live down there.
Down there?.
Yes, there.
-You're called Kunga?.
-Yes.
-Would you like some snuff?.
-No.
Was there a lot of snow here this year?.
Not so much,just a little.
But it snowed more back there?.
Yes, there was more snow there.
Was there less here than lastyear?.
Yes. Normallywe have to move...
Doyou?.
...so the animals can survive.
In that case the grass must be better than lastyear?.
Yes, there's more grass here this year.
So that's whyyou didn't move!
This yak has been ill since last night.
It has a twisting ofthe intestines.
It hasn't been well for a few days.
We need somebodywho knows something about this illness.
I don't know how to go about it.
When there isn't enough grass, the animals eat sand.
That's why this has happened.
There's no good grass here.
The other three have gone to look for theyak herd.
But they still aren't backyet, they've been a long time.
We have to find somebody who can help us with theyak!
I'm afraid it will die.
It has to have an operation!
Ifwe have it operated on,
I hope it will survive!
What are we to do with this poor little yak?.
-How are you?.
-Fine.
So we meet after all.
Pardon?.
I thought you wouldn't go to Lake Tsentso this year.
I'm away a lot these days.
Yes.
Yes, then...
You look younger every year.
-Really!?.
-Yes, you do.
Myyaks called Drawu, Rokpu,
Jawu, Zagur, Bandung...
I have lost them all and still haven't found them.
They disappeared in December, still no trace ofthem.
If there really is salt in LakeTsentso, that's good for us.
That's good for you people.
But we can't fetch the salt
Iike the lorries do.
And who knows how deep the mud is?.
It's better than it used to be.
I hope so.
What am I to do?.
I think it's better if the yak has an operation now that we're here at the doctor's.
And then we also need time for the preparations and rituals.
It goes nyok-nyok!
It has already burst.
Already burst!?.
Really!?.
Come here and listen!
Why cause even more suffering?.
An operation is useless and nothing but unnecessary pain.
Come here, come here.
Burst!
Nothing more can be done.
Why kill, when it isn't necessary?.
We people of the land of Dharma don't kill any animals if it isn't necessary.
The animal will die anyway, why cause it additional suffering?.
I promised the salt men that if the yak dies, I'll pay them 200 yuan.
The meat will be eaten.
We shall use it, we don't throw it away.
For me and my people, salt is our life.
Like this time, those people who sent their animals along with us, they also expect us to bring salt back with us when we return.
Therefore we have to do our best.
It's just as the proverb says:
Until victory is won, you have to strive for it.
We have to fight until we've reached our goal.
Isn't that so?.
That's one thing.
And it would also be unthinkable to come home without salt.
That's how it is, we have to do our best.
Pushuk, pushuk, what an awful wind!
We, the warlords Shenpa,
Bernag, Mishang and Ngebum must lead the army against Jang and conquer the precious salt lakes.
Mywarriors from Horwill set up their camp with three different-coloured tents: tents as white as the snow mountains, tents as black as the night, tents as red as blood.
Our people say that Lake Tsentso is the heart of His Holiness Karmapa.
After the death ofthe former Karmapa it was a problem for sixyears to find salt in this lake.
So many salt people went the long way to Lake Yaggen, others to Angtang, to Chuwo or to Lake Biru.
Since Karmapa has been reincarnated there is again salt in Lake Tsentso.
And from year toyear it seems to get better.
This salt lake is the heart of Karmapa!
That's what one used to say, but it really is so!
This is the quality of the salt.
Is this here good?.
No difference, almost as good.
This is from here, and this from over there.
This one looks a bit better.
Which one?.
It's almost the same.
If I scrape the salt together with my golden tool, it makes itselfinto a heap.
The little heaps look like halo-flowers.
There are salt flowers as far as the eye can see.
Ifyou don't know where there is salt, there is salt under my scraper!
Ifyou don't know where the scraper is, the scraper is under the handle.
Grainy, the salt is grainy.
It doesn't depend on efficiency in this work.
It depends on the karma!
And when fetching salt, on the favour ofthe goddess.
Matsenten Gyalmo is the mistress of the
Iake, they say. I don't know much more.
Matsenten Gyalmo - if I imagine her as a human being, she is a woman.
We salt men call her mother.
She is also a goddess who keeps us from starving.
We are deeply grateful to Matsenten
Gyalmo for helping us to live.
When you think ofthe mother at home, then work fast.
When you think of the mother of the salt lake, then work slowly.
When there is no salt in the salt lake it comes from not obeying the rules.
Ifyou pollute the lake, kill here or aren't friendly with each other, the lake doesn't like it, then it isn't willing to give the salt.
I once had to wait a whole month and then I was only able to
Ioad halftheyaks, therewasn't enough salt.
The reason was that we were here in people's communes and the leader of our commune had sleptwith women on theway, and this disturbed the salt lake.
You had towait, and at times it looked as if there was going to be salt - but when you went there, there was again no salt.
More water came and flushed the salt away.
So much salt is in the carrying skin, it is heavy and full to the brim.
The salt is plentiful!
The carrying skin,
Iift it to the right, tip it to the left.
That's how we throw the salt on the heap.
You, nomad from Changtang, don't remain idle, come and work with the salt!
I don't feel lonely.
Since I was 1 3 to 1 4 years old
I've always been herding animals.
My merit is that I can handle animals, that I love them and care for them, not that I'm good at business.
I can't do business or convince others by talking.
I'm no good at smooth talking.
When I talk about responsibility - this may sound like pride - but it is so that the otherthree have far fewer worries.
They do have to go to the salt lake, extract the salt, carry it to the shore, stuff it in sacks. But at night they can sleep peacefully while I always have to worry about the animals.
I do stuffthe salt sack tightly, stuffand stuffthe lower part, so the salt won't float away on the way across the river.
I do stuff the salt sack tightly, stuff and stuff the middle part, so I can rest it on my chest when loading.
I do stuff the salt sack tightly, stuff and stuff the top, so the rain won't wash the salt away.
Hello, Pargen!
Hello!
-Is the salt soon ready?.
-Yes.
So soon?. Quicker than last year!
Yes, this time it went well.
Was it hard work?.
No, it was quite easy.
Then I'll slowly bring the animals round to the salt lake.
Take some snuff!.
Never in my life did it go as quickly as this time, it's like a dream!
Even such things can happen.
An old proverb says: Stay at the salt
Iake for eight days, leave on the 9th, that's how it must be.
Yes, that's the most convenient time.
And that's just the case with us this time. We really are lucky!
That all went so well this time...
That is pure luck!
...is thanks to our local god Tanglha, the Lamas or our own efforts.
The goddess accompanies the salt men all the way right to their front door, where the women and barking dogs greet them.
Yes, that's what one used to say.
The goddess Matsenten Gyalmo has shown us her great favour.
The soft snow this morning is like a water offering for the goddess.
Are there many lorries at the salt lake?.
At first only two, now there are more.
That's never been.
Only so few!?.
Now the yaks, too, will be happy.
The olderyaks, who have been to the salt lake before, think:
We shall go hungry today, but tomorrow we can return to the pastures.
The yaks who have never been here wonderwhy they have to walk so far and yet never get to the grass.
And they can't talk either!
Pull up with the left hand, sew with the right hand, whoever can't do that may not belong to the salt men.
The sack has an opening ofa "to".
Take needle and thread, sew the sack up tightly.
Theyak is wild.
At the opening ofthe sack the thieflurks.
You'll regret not having sewn it well!
Her character is that of a rather angry goddess who is very sensitive to disturbances.
If the men here quarrel, if they sleep with women or break wind at the lake, she reacts very strongly and directly to these things.
Only Margen enjoys a certain freedom here.
He doesn't have to be as careful as we.
The lake forgives him the most.
Bad deeds aren't allowed here, otherwise there's no salt.
Negative actions have the same results.
Nowadays the goddess has become more gentle, that's what the older people say.
I myselfhaven't so much experience here.
The good father is Amu Kangri.
The good mother is Matsenten Gyalmo.
The good sons are Gedun and Busum.
Maywe return to the salt lake next spring with manyyaks, many Bopsas and in good company and return safely back home again.
The Lamas, meditation gods, sacrificial goddesses, tutelary gods...
Mayyou,
Mother Matsenten Gyalmo, accept with pleasure the sacrificial yak.
We, your good sons, return home with joy.
You accept, Mother Gyalmo, accept the offering with joy.
And now the goddess allows us one last shovel of salt.
We, your good sons, return home with joy.
The god of victory in the body of man,
King Gesar,
Iooked at the warriors with the eyes of the ruler and the merciful.
And he gave them the initiation ofthe ninefold Vajra and the transformation of the soul.
Finally the great
King Gesar raised his divine voice and sang the song of the conquest of the twelve salt lakes, ofthe capture of Yulha and ofthe subjugation ofJang.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
After a return journey of 45 days the caravan came back to their families.
For one more year the salt secured them their living.
The systematic modernization increases the serious threat to the right of existence of the Tibetan salt nomads and so to the last feeling of freedom in this country.
With the decline ofthe salt men's tradition another part of cultural identity of the Tibetans will be lost.
This film is dedicated to the salt men and their families.
Our most sincere thanks go to Margen,
Pargen, the Lord of the Animals and Bopsa for having allowed us to accompany them on their extraordinary journey.
Everybody else is going.
I don't care about everybody else. You're not.
Dad?
Never mind Dad.
- You are not going on an unsupervised camping trip.
- In a backyard, Mom.
- A large backyard.
- Billy's older brother's gonna be watchin'--
Billy's older brother is 15.
Can we just eat, please?
That is not supervision for nine 13-year-olds.
I'm sorry.
- Is it just overnight?
- Girls and boys.
No, I am sorry.
I'm so sick of never being able to--
[ Man ] Kevin.
- She treats me like I'm 10!
It's, like, ridiculous!
- I'm treating you like you're--
Don't speak to me
in that tone of voice,
young man!
Benny Ray is going.
Kyle Tanner is going.
Kevin, I don't care what they're doing.
- If Kyle Tanner jumped off a bridge, would you?
- Shut up, Carol.
[ Carol ] Unacceptable.
The other kids think
I'm a joke because--
- We're not talking about
other kids.
- Why do I have to--
That is enough.
You don't talk to your mother that way.
[ Huffs ]
Oh.
It's a bunch of kids in an overnight tent.
Is it really that big a deal?
Yes. They're not old enough to--
Will the parents be home inside?
John, support me please.
What message do we send?
If you stomp away from the table, you get what you want?
- Mommy's big on messages.
- All right, Carol.
Kevin told me to shut up, and that's unacceptable.
Yes, it is.
I think maybe we have to explain the reason and not always hit him with "no."
Honey, I did give him a reason.
He just can't accept it because all his friends are going.
[ Carol Screaming ]
No!
[ Line Ringing ]
[ Cell Door Opens, Closes ]
[ Sirens Wailing ]
Where did you get the gun?
The safe.
I keep it in a safe upstairs.
Kevin knew the combination
in case--
You say you didn't wanna kill her?
What did you think would happen if you shot her?
I was just so mad.
I don't know.
What have you done?
A little face lift, that's all.
What's this? What's that?
None of it works, but it looks like it does.
And the point being--
The point being... any new client who comes in here will feel confident that we have all the resources.
I'm afraid of computers.
Where's my stuff?
Where's my photos?
I have a meeting with John Monahan of Crutcher and Dunn.
He's exploring the idea of using us for their class action asbestos.
- Really?
- They heard about our tobacco cases.
Asbestos?
Plaintiffs. We'd be on the side of merit, Ellenor.
And the case is huge.
You'd be able to fill your other ear with metal.
- Funny.
- But we're never gonna land them unless we look up to it.
Is that what this is about?
Partly.
They want us to actually try the case?
They want a meeting.
But I think that's what it's about.
Arms up.
I go into appeals this afternoon.
You got the video?
We got it.
So we have a chance.
With the video, we got a shot, right?
I'd go so far as to even say a good chance.
But courts don't like to put killers back on the street.
But the Constitution--
That's like, uh, sacred to those judges, right?
Sacred, I don't know.
But, yeah, most of them have read it.
Ms. Gamble, this boy is an honor student.
He's never been caught in the hall without a pass.
This is a book report he wrote about some poetry last fall.
Just take a second and read it.
This is a good kid.
- Mr. Larson, you're a friend of the family?
- That's right.
I know your firm.
It's as good as any in this town.
But you're primarily a civil litigator, right?
I mean no offense, but--
Well, sometimes
"friends of the family" lawyers can do more harm than good.
This boy's in a lot of trouble.
He needs an experienced criminal defense attorney.
I appreciate your candor.
I do plan to find someone--
Well, he should've been in this room from the beginning.
Do you know Bobby Donnell?
I've certainly heard of him, and not all good.
For this stuff, there's nobody better.
What's more, he doesn't phone it in.
Call him.
First thing,
I'd like to speak to him and his dad.
Good.
No problem.
The boy who shot his mother.
Oh, God.
Paper said it was
'cause he couldn't go on some camping trip or somethin'.
Where do these kids come from?
I mean, how do they get--
His own mother?
Oh, man!
What happened up in here?
Kendall. You get
kicked out of school?
Teacher conference.
Half days all week.
Mm-hmm.
Hey!
What's up, player?
What's up, man?
My mom's outta town.
I'm a menace. Right, Dad?
Uh, when the cat's away--
Red Sox tomorrow night.
Oh!
Man, this place is the bomb!
Who did it?
Do I hear Kendall, or do we have another rat?
- Lindsay!
- How you doin'?
I'm all right.
How are you?
Becky, you mind me leavin' him here for the afternoon?
I gotta be at appeals court at 2:00.
No problem.
Appeals for what?
Sholey.
The shooter on those teenagers.
Really?
What's the grounds?
Bad confession.
It was bad too.
The videotape is on your desk, all cued up.
Uh, thanks.
I hate to sound like a broken record, but I don't know how you could fight to turn that guy loose.
- He killed two innocent teenagers.
- My dad can get anybody off.
Right, Dad?
Son, I argue legal rights.
And you get the guy off, right?
[ Eugene ]
Lookit here, chief.
Meet me in the conference room, okay?
I'll be right in.
What's new in there?
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean for him to hear--
Commonwealth versus Kevin Blair, minor, murder in the second degree.
Robert Donnell for the defendant, Your Honor.
Helen Gamble for the Commonwealth.
[ Bobby ]
We ask, pending trial, that Kevin be committed... to the custody of his father,
John Blair.
Given it's a murder, Your Honor, the Department of Youth Services--
- In the interests of Kevin--
- I'm sending him to D.Y.S. for now.
Let's conference this afternoon and make a plan.
[ Bobby ]
Thank you, Your Honor.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
Thanks for taking this.
Why me?
Well, I think the media's gonna go nuts.
He is a pretty good kid.
I'd like to work it out quickly and quietly.
[ John ]
What happens now?
He'll meet with the court psychiatrist.
I'll be there for that.
Then we'll sit down with the judge.
The big decision... is whether he gets tried as an adult or a juvenile.
Adult?
He's 13.
I understand.
But when it's murder--
This isn't Arkansas.
The political pressure to go adult will be huge.
Oh, God.
Fortunately,
Helen Gamble, the D.A., isn't leaning that way.
We also caught a break getting that judge.
She is completely impervious to politics.
I'm glad she didn't grant custody to me.
I love my son.
But he killed my wife.
It's hard for me to look at him.
[ Sobbing ]
Mr. Blair.
Obviously, this is the worst thing you'll ever go through.
It-It-- It's--
And I know he probably needs me to hold him, hug him.
I can't bring myself to.
Would you... please tell him how much I love him?
Sure.
You know what criminal lawyers do.
We make sure that everybody gets their right to a fair trial.
That's what I do.
You know that?
I know.
I'm not in the business of getting murderers off.
But you do sometimes.
It's my job to make sure that the government can prove their case.
'Cause if they don't, if they can't, then they shouldn't be able to put people in jail.
I know.
You do?
Yeah.
If somebody kills somebody, you keep the police from provin' it, and you get the guy off.
In your own words,
I need to hear it.
I just got so mad.
I went running to get the gun.
Were you thinking
you'd shoot her
when you got the gun?
I don't know.
Maybe a little.
"Maybe a little"?
Kevin, I know this is difficult.
But for me to help you--
Tell me what you're thinking right now.
I wanna wake up.
You wanna wake up?
I want this to be a dream.
It's not a dream.
No.
And I would remind the court, this tape wasn't available to the defense at the time of the trial.
No, we understand that, counsel.
Are you saying your client... would not have been convicted but for this confession?
[ Eugene ]
There's no question about it.
The State had no witnesses, even though they lied to my client as you'll see in this tape.
Let's roll it.
[ Tape Loads ]
We all know you were the shooter, Brad.
This really isn't about that.
But if you help me out here, maybe there's something
I can do for you.
Shouldn't I get a lawyer or somethin'?
I think I need my lawyer.
[ Detective ]
Cigarette?
No.
If you get a lawyer, he instructs you not to talk, this thing gets all adversary.
You've been here before.
They'll send in some rookie public defender... who cares more about coverin' his own ass.
You get your life sentence.
But, hell, by tellin' you to keep quiet, his balls stay protected.
You gotta think about a few things here, Brad.
We have two eyewitnesses fingering you as the shooter.
No P.D.'s gonna change the result.
And the other-- these were teenagers you killed.
You're facing double life... with bunkmates who are gonna redo the plumbing inside your rectum.
The only friend in life you got right now is me.
I'm the only one that can help you.
Why you wanna help me?
You didn't go there to shoot them kids, did you?
You only wanted their car.
The shooting was something you didn't mean to happen.
I'm right, aren't I?
I know those kids weren't angels, and I know that you're not a cold-blooded kind of person.
They fought back, didn't they?
You just wanted their car.
They fought back.
Three hours and 13 minutes later, my client confessed to killing
Wanda and Steven Simmons.
And your claim
is that this confession
is unconstitutional?
He asked for his lawyer.
As soon as that happened, the interrogation, by law, has to stop.
That tape made clear the defendant never asked for his lawyer.
Are you serious?
He only said--
He never officially asked.
He said at the very start--
That he thought maybe he should get a lawyer.
But he never directly asked.
- "I think I need my lawyer."
- I have to admit, Mr. Coffee, you're splitting hairs.
If a suspect says,
"I think I need my lawyer," his intent obviously--
- But he changed his mind.
- He's not allowed to change his mind.
He's not allowed to change his mind?
His mind can't be changed by the police officer.
No, it can't.
As soon as a suspect asks for his lawyer, discussion stops.
Here, it didn't.
It sounds cliché, but "normal kid."
Who killed his mother?
Yes.
Normal 13-year-old boys, they don't--
I understand.
What I'm saying is
I found no psychosis, no schizophrenia.
Then why?
He lost his temper,
and a gun was handy.
Do me a favor, Doctor, and have the decency to not sound casual about this.
This boy, he was close to his mother.
They had a very good relationship.
He seems stunned that she isn't coming back.
Doesn't that suggest some sort of diminished capacity?
He shoots her, but he can't understand why she's not living?
Uh, it isn't that.
Cognitively, he knows.
But emotionally, he's experiencing deep grief.
And there's nothing in his history?
I've only spent a couple of hours so far, but so far, I've found nothing.
Well, boys just don't shoot their parents.
Give me something.
You want a reason, Judge, turn on the news.
Nightlinewill put on experts.
They'll talk about family values, bad parenting.
Pick up a newspaper.
You'll see articles about too much television.
Maybe he got dropped on his head at birth.
There's no shortage of opinions.
And you can throw them all out.
There must be a sign.
Sure, there's a sign.
In Little League, he threw his bat a few times.
He fought at recess on occasion.
If you're desperate for a sign, cling to those.
But there simply is nothing overt... to explain why this kid had an impulse to kill.
No reason as to why he couldn't control that impulse.
You want it to be comprehensible.
We all do.
It may never be.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
So, what are you going to do?
Uh--
Uh, I'm not sure yet.
On the one hand, he--
I think I have to charge him as an adult.
That is not the way to go, Helen.
You said yourself
"quickly and quietly."
I understand.
But I'm looking at a pretty mature, well-adjusted kid here.
Who gets served?
The reason you brought me in is because this case is different.
It's not about win/lose.
Now, what gets served?
That's what I keep asking.
What gets served?
Well, let's make a decision.
I'm afraid it's gonna have to be made by you, Your Honor.
Fine.
I'll set the hearing for tomorrow.
This kid is gonna lose his life.
Part of me hopes you win this.
But that question,
"Who gets served"--
[ Sighs ]
Where my duty lies,
I gotta go adult.
[ Ellenor ]
I don't like it.
[ Jimmy ]
I don't even know what it is.
[ Rebecca ] It's a painting.
But it's all jumbled.
What kind of message does that send?
You teach kids to color inside the lines.
They come in and see that--
The message it sends is flush is expensive.
Lindsay bought it?
Ah! Got it on loan.
She wants it here when our asbestos clients come in.
Oh, please.
Ellenor, don't "Oh, please."
You know it works.
Clients just glance at our track record.
What matters to them are the cars we drive.
If they're expensive, we must be good.
If we look rich, we must be winners.
You really think we could get this trial?
Hey, we got an interview.
Timing couldn't be better.
We're hot off of beating the tobacco industry.
Bobby's name is in all the papers with this kid shooting his mother.
What are we talking about here?
[ Ellenor ]
Class action.
Thousand-plus plaintiffs.
Even if we split the contingency, we're lookin' at seven figures minimum.
- Seven for us?
- For us.
I love that painting.
[ Chuckling ]
Think they'll win it this year?
The Sox?
Next year.
Every year is next year for the Red Sox.
Yeah. It must be tough playin' in this town.
Fans have a million years of frustration pent up.
Wonder how they manage to play at all.
I can't feel sorry for ballplayers.
Makin' that kind of money to play a game in the summer and take the winters off--
[ Scoffs ]
They don't get my sympathy.
You're that lawyer for that killer, aren't you?
Sholey-- that guy who killed those two teenagers.
You're his lawyer.
Yeah.
Can I ask you somethin'?
How do you do that?
I mean, isn't it hard to--
You know, people like that?
Every man or woman gets his day in court.
I understand.
But this guy's pure scum, isn't he?
He's a human being.
It's just... those teenagers, they were my kids.
I'm, um, sorry.
You like what you do for a living, Mr. Young?
It's nice to see you do draw lines.
You'd never sympathize with a ballplayer.
[ Slams Newspaper Down ]
It went okay.
I didn't think the D.A. came back with much.
So? We could win?
We should win, Brad, unless they want to rewrite the law.
But there is no time limit.
My bet is they're gonna sit on this case a long, long time.
And what, not do anything?
You gotta understand.
Us winning means turning you loose.
You killed two people.
Setting you free isn't gonna be on anybody's list of priorities.
But it went good?
I think it did.
Yes.
When I was assigned this case, every instinct was let's not make this a bigger tragedy than it already is.
But he committed a very adult crime.
It was knowing.
He walked upstairs, turned the combination on a safe to the left, to the right and back to the left.
He loaded bullets into a revolver.
He walked back downstairs... and executed a human being.
[ Bobby ]
If he is tried as an adult, he receives a life sentence.
Let's not dance around that reality.
He's got no defense of the crime itself.
As an adult, second degree murder carries an automatic life sentence.
- We have to face that.
- We also have to face what he did.
[ Bobby ]
He's 13 years old.
If he had impregnated his teacher, the teacher would go to jail and the world would be saying,
"He's a child."
But because of the politics and outrage of murder, the world says, "Adult.
"Treat him as an adult.
Don't be soft."
As much as I feel for this boy, and I do, as much as I feel for his family,
I can't escape--
I can't look at him and say,
"He's just a kid."
[ Bobby ]
You can say that, Helen, because he is a kid.
And if you're saying there's no chance of rehabilitation... with a 13-year-old, then... you're saying rehabilitation shouldn't even exist as a concept.
He didn't steal a car, Bobby.
I'll take this under advisement.
[ John ]
How you doin', kid?
We'll, uh--
We're gonna get through this.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I know.
Will you tell Carol
I'm sorry?
Yeah.
Does she hate me now?
No.
[ Jimmy ]
Asbestos clients.
Show time.
Here they come.
Here they come.
- Okay.
So you're gonna buzz me.
- What do I say?
- Anything.
Just stay on the line.
- This is so ridiculous.
Shh! There's no need to panic.
I'll walk you through it.
John, if you go into a courtroom oozing anxiety, the judge will see that.
Okay, you're gonna do exactly as I say.
We're looking for Lindsay Dole.
[ Lindsay ]
Hold on.
Hi, Mr. Monahan?
It's me. Um, let's go into the conference room.
Rebecca, could you show them?
Of course.
The reason I'm not panicked is a 12-B-6 isn't just viable, it will win.
Hi.
[ Lindsay ]
I have a meeting. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Two minutes, you buzz me.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Sighs ]
I'm sorry it's a little crazy.
I've got a panicked house counsel in Detroit.
- Well, we appreciate your agreeing to the meeting.
- My pleasure.
Cutting to it--
Your success against the tobacco company has our interest piqued.
Especially since, uh--
Well, going up against the asbestos industry, uh--
We're facing a comparable Goliath.
- How many in the class?
- We're up to almost 1,300.
Certified?
[ Woman ]
Mm-hmm.
[ Monahan ]
We've already survived
a motion to decertify.
Most of the discovery is done. We have a September trial date.
- [ Phone Rings ]
- I'm sorry. Yes?
Hey, Lindsay.
Been to any wild orgies lately?
Calm-- Calm down, John.
John, listen. Who's the judge?
Albright. Albright.
[ Typing ]
Albright.
Okay, I've got him.
Has a reputation for being colloquial.
I definitely want local counsel.
Oh, good news.
He's spoken at seminars on frivolous litigation.
He'll be receptive to the 12-B-6 and our Rule 11.
Now, I--
I don't want to file till July, however.
I'm just curious.
You ever tried, uh, mud wrestling?
The reason is he has a summer home on Lake Ontario.
He puts in a three-day work week. He likes to keep his docket down.
Statistically, he kicks 30% more cases in July and August.
John? John,
I have to call you back.
I'm in a meeting with clients.
Okay? Okay.
Bye-bye.
I'm very sorry.
You've never done an asbestos litigation, have you?
No, but that's not the problem.
- Can I cut to what
I do perceive as a problem?
- Absolutely.
I had a chance to look over some of the pleadings and witness lists.
Public record. Sorry.
We may have a difference in trial philosophy.
Which would be?
You seem to be emphasizing causation.
On these kinds of cases, we tend not to.
How do you prove a case without causation?
Well, I'm not saying ignore it, but when proving it depends on science, you're putting two heavy burdens on a jury.
One, you're asking them to understand it.
Two, you're asking them to stay awake.
Anything they don't understand, they get suspicious of.
And with asbestos, just like tobacco, you have a presumption.
They already know it kills.
The defense can't pick apart that premise.
They can pick apart science.
I'm wary of leaving evidence out.
Yeah, that's what I figured.
We're probably not the right firm for you.
Be seated.
Under
Minnick versus Mississippi, the law is quite clear.
When a suspect asks for his attorney, all further interrogation must stop.
The tape here was very disturbing, seeing the police lie about having witnesses, misrepresenting information.
Nevertheless, this kind of police conduct is entirely permissible.
And since we find the defendant stopped short of directly asking for counsel, we unanimously find the confession to be admissible.
The conviction therefore stands.
Adjourned.
[ Gavel Raps ]
Permission to address the court.
Permission to address this court.
Proceed.
You people just ignored the law.
We've made our ruling, and I see no--
I heard your ruling.
Uh, the other day,
I had to explain
to my 10-year-old... how I could come into this room and fight for a man who killed two people.
Yesterday, I had to look this man in the eye--
[ Judge Clarke ]
Counsel--
Counsel what?
You gonna give me a speech, Judge?
Tell me how the Bill of Rights, how the Constitution has to count for something?
I gave that speech to my kid.
I told myself that... while havin' to look at the father of two dead teenagers, two kids my client shot!
[ Judge Callahan ]
Mr. Young--
Permission to address this court!
Ten years I've been puttin' them back out there-- criminals, sometimes rapists, sometimes murderers.
Ten years, all the time tellin' myself there's a reason.
You're 10 seconds from a contempt order!
Do it! There are rules!
Rules, damn it!
We don't let the police coerce confessions.
We don't let 'em beat down doors without warrants.
We don't let them grill suspects after they ask for their lawyers.
My client damn well asked for his lawyer, and all three of you sittin' up there, you know it!
- You're out of order!
- You're out of order!
You disgraced the bench, this room.
You just raped the Sixth Amendment!
I hold you in contempt.
I hold all three of you in contempt!
Take him and put him in lockup.
I'll rot in that cell... if giving you respect is a condition for my getting out.
I'll rot.
Dad, did you hit somebody?
No.
How long?
Till morning.
I argued a called strike.
They'll let him visit for an hour.
I'll keep him with me tonight.
He belongs in here with me.
- I'll be back.
- Thanks again.
So, what happened?
Sit down, buddy.
You heard me talk of your Uncle Curtis?
Jail Uncle Curtis?
Yeah. You remember what he went to jail for?
They thought he knocked off a liquor store and capped somebody.
But he didn't, right?
Yeah.
And, uh, the reason he ended up in prison... was that he fit the description of whoever did do it, and the police arrested him.
They kept him in a room for 20 hours.
Kept makin' him drink coffee and not lettin' him go to the bathroom.
Kept tellin' him that if he'd just confess, that everything would go better.
And that if he didn't confess, they'd arrest my sister and they'd both get the death penalty.
Told him if he cooperated, he could leave.
And after 20 hours, they had him to the point... where he would say anything just to go home.
And he signed a confession to a crime he didn't commit.
You hate the police, don't you?
I don't hate the police.
Most of them are good people.
Kendall, most of my clients did the crime.
I won't lie to you about that.
The reason I fight for 'em... is as soon as we allow the police to use illegal methods, sure, more guilty people will be convicted, but more innocent people will too.
That's what I fight for.
Here he comes.
Stay calm.
Everybody calm. Look busy.
Um, file.
Are they hiring us?
I don't know.
Stay calm!
I'm calm. You stay calm!
- [ Rebecca ]
Shh!
- Hi.
Mr. Monahan.
Thank you for letting me drop by on such short notice.
- Sure.
- Listen, uh,
we've thought about it.
We would like to hire you.
Really? I am serious about our trial philosophy.
[ Monahan ]
I understand.
We're on board with it.
- You obviously get results.
- Fine.
Files will be delivered?
Today. I'd like to schedule a coordination conference for next week if possible.
We can do that.
Great.
I'll be in touch.
Good.
[ Door Opens ]
Let him get in the elevator.
Four, three, two, one.
[ Screaming, Laughing ]
Be seated.
For the past several days,
I've felt compelled to blame.
Easy access to guns, television, movies, brainwashing children with violence-- all disgustingly denying any accountability.
Blame.
But in this room, young man, it comes down to youraccountability.
I doubt that you
or anybody else
in this room... will ever make sense of why you killed your mother.
There's no rhyme,
no reason,
and ultimately no excuse.
You ended your own childhood.
I'm granting the district attorney's petition to charge you as an adult.
- Adjourned.
- [ Gavel Raps ]
[ Sighs ]
I gotta know why.
We all fall where we fall on this, Mr. Donnell.
Nobody's right, nobody's wrong.
We all fall where we fall.
Yeah.
But you're the judge.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm the judge.
You wanna swap places?
You could've opted for hope instead of--
What makes you think
I didn't?
You know,
I sit on that bench every day seeing the evil in people.
Hope for me lies in the child.
Hope won't allow me to see the child in him.
He murdered his own mother.
That doesn't sound like legal reasoning to me.
Well, legal reasoning can only deal... with the consequences of what he did.
And I'll be damned if I'm going to send that message... to the next
13-year-old with a gun.
This was about
one 13-year-old.
With the power to make you hate God.
I have to believe a child couldn't do that.
If a child could, then that surely is the death of hope.
An apology lets you out.
You don't get it.
Did you really think we would set him free?
I'm naive enough to believe the Sixth Amendment means something.
Liberty doesn't lie in the Constitution,
Mr. Young.
It doesn't lie in the law or the courtroom.
It lies in a man's heart.
And in my heart, I wasn't going to turn loose a man who I knew would kill again.
"The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not sure it's right."
If you're gonna quote
Learned Hand, try to remember the essence of his speech.
And the spirit of your ruling, Judge, is that you knew you were wrong.
We have to be able to sleep at night too.
And you didn't sleep last night, did you?
I congratulate you on your righteousness.
I salute your ability to look at death... and feel nothing but patriotism for playing your part.
We all signed up to do our jobs, Judge.
You betrayed yours.
And I will not stand here and let you tell me what's in my heart.
Now, there's no crime to being a coward.
It just shouldn't be cloaked in a robe.
Asbestos class action.
Lindsay's backing up her threat to make us flush.
I'd probably celebrate more if I were a partner.
You will be, Jimmy.
How you feelin'?
Your wounds healin' up okay?
Yeah. Yours?
You mean Spivak?
Uh, no, I--
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Just a guy.
Another one will come along.
Plenty of fish.
Schools.
I've had judges look the other way before, but--
But what?
Some of the disgust is my own.
When my son said,
"My dad can get murderers off.
He can get anybody off," it hit me like a train.
Since, I've been lookin' at myself through his eyes.
What I do, what I am.
I needed that appeals court for some kind of validation.
Eugene, the disgrace of that ruling... belongs to those judges, not to you.
Explain that to my boy, could you?
The courts didn't wanna put a killer back out there.
I did.
Explain to him how
I'm the good guy, huh?
Look, it's not always a meritocracy.
I mean, judges rule for the wrong reasons sometimes.
Clients choose you because of paint jobs.
Lindsay landed a coup with fake computers.
And you know what?
That case she got, every firm in town would drool over it.
It could make us a lot of money.
But what I'll go home and celebrate a little tonight... is that you and I spent the last few days... fighting for people no firm in this town would touch.
And we both lost.
Maybe it's right we lost.
I don't know.
But what I do know is what makes the courtroom a noble place... is that people like you go in there and fight.
Sometimes, on principle alone.
I don't know how long
I can keep doin' it.
Me neither.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
This movie is about groups,
Metal, guitars, girls, all that stuff
But ultimately, the movie is only half the story,
Because half the true magic is about the fans.
[SCREAMING]
The most vocal fans all the time are heavy metal fans.
They're the best.
I salute them.
[SCREAMING]
[CRADLE TO THE GRAVE
BY MOTORHEAD PLAYING]
Ain't so bad, ain't so bad
Could've been a loser
Ain't so bad, ain't so bad
Rather be a boozer
Standing at the crossroads
See where the wind blows
Following the white line
Following my nose
You've been living
On a razor's edge
Soon as you learned to shave
Make sure you live
Be a long time dead
Cradle to the grave
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Ain't too good,
Don't look good
But it'll get worse
Don't look good,
Don't feel good
It's gonna take years
Life drives you nuts, babe
'Cause if you ain't certain
It'll kick you in the guts, babe
And leave you hurting
Don't matter up or down
Sideways, in or out
If it makes you feel good,
Do it
And then get out
You've been living
On a razor's edge
Listen to what I say
Don't spend your life
In your own bed
Cradle to the grave
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
WOMAN: What do you think kids like about metal?
I don't know. I guess they feel
They can escape from the real world.
They can, just like, be what they wanna be.
Be dumb, be cool, be crazy, whatever.
Like, they can do what they want.
WOMAN: Do you like heavy metal music?
- Yeah.
- What do you like about it?
Heavy metal was more of an evolution, unlike punk rock.
It evolved from hard rock bands
Such as Led Zeppelin, The Doors,
Uriah Heep, Black Sabbath,
Iron Butterfly, Deep Purple.
ALL: Metal!
And really, it changed so much,
Except for maybe perhaps the technical element,
But the energy is still there.
The fun is still there.
There's nothing but...
[DRUM BEATING]
A fist in your face.
And I think that's what's the great thing about metal.
That's, uh... It saved rock and roll for the '80s.
Well, I think heavy metal
Is, is the true rock and roll of the '80s.
And rock and roll was basically music
Made by people who were thinking with their crotches.
Punk was getting to be techno.
Punk was turning into disco in disguise.
It's faster and it's aggressive and it's rebellious
And their parents hate it.
Which has always been the mark of good rock and roll.
If your parents don't like it, it's good.
WOMAN: What do you think parents think about you?
Do I care?
The heavy metal bands
Just picked up on one little thing that we did.
You know, I mean we do that kind of music real well, you know,
But this is like this much of what we do.
You know, we do a whole bunch of things.
I like that spine-chilling feeling.
That get goosebumps up the spine, that... [HISSES]
Like you really got me.
[PLAYS AIR GUITAR]
It's like, it's like an orgasm, you know.
Sex and rock and roll, the American way.
WOMAN: I know that all the girls
In the audience are gonna wanna know...
Sixteen inches.
WOMAN: No! No.
Combination of all four.
We're four, four a piece.
What is a fucking rock star?
Some dude that's got more money than I do?
I got a bigger dick than all those people.
We're just fucking big.
You know what, we...
It doesn't mean anything.
- You know, I...
- We just like to party.
I mean, it doesn't matter what size your pencil is,
It's how you write your name.
[CHEERING]
WOMAN: What's a head banger?
When we first started doing this stuff...
Aye, aye, aye...
When we first started doing this stuff,
We didn't really talk about head banging.
We talked about girl banging, you know, gang banging.
Anything but head banging.
That doesn't seem very nice to do.
GIRL: Hot!
A head banger, they go out in front of the stage
And they head bang their head and...
It's cool.
I mean, that's them, that's not me.
I like to stand back and watch and see everything.
I like to scam on the chicks.
A head banger is somebody who dies for his music,
Who, who's a true rivet head, you know.
A head banger is somebody who likes thrash, nothing but.
Who doesn't accept glam in any way.
A head banger is uh, someone that drives by in their car
And goes, "Metal D, fucking metal! Can't they see?"
I think we started that.
Motörhead bangers, you see.
WOMAN: Are you into it?
Mm, not really. I'd rather get drunk and kick back.
And watch them make fools of themselves.
That's just a rock and roll reaction.
Uh...
And I think the, uh,
The actual head bangers of the '80s
Just make it a little more pronounced.
They bleed a lot more than...
I'm just the drummer,
I don't bang my head.
I beat off, man.
[DRUM BEATS]
Attention, everybody!
Attention.
Attention, you, creatures from another planet, you...
Hello, suckers!
Please be advised...
Be advised that...
Be advised that, uh...
- Give it up.
- I'm fucking up.
By your entry upon these premises...
You are consenting to be photographed and filmed,
Naked or otherwise...
You know, pictures and shit like that...
And having your ugly likeness...
And sound effects used in motion pictures...
Home porno and other purposes...
You, sick dirty dogs, you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And give us your money.
[PLAYING BORN TO BE WILD]
Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Gonna make it happen
Take the world
In a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
I like smoke and lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder
What we always wanted was to be
The biggest, most outrageous heavy metal band
That could possibly get together.
Gonna make it happen
Take the world
In a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature's child
We were born
Born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild
Yeah!
LIZZY: Most people think it's, it's a glamorous life
And you just go from playing at small clubs
And the next thing you know, you're playing,
You know, the far ends of the world
There's a million bands out there.
And all these bands are playing the clubs
And they're playing them for a long time.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
But you do get tired of the road.
Every night, you know.
Seven nights a week.
And that, that's our schedule.
Seven nights a week, playing.
It gets, it gets to the point where you kind of...
You go crazy.
And I think that's why, uh, a lot of, the rockers
Are kind of senile.
Because it happens to every...
- WOMAN: Burned out.
- Yeah.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Born to be wild
Yeah!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
MAN: Lizzy Borden!
Thank you. Good night!
WOMAN: Where are you gonna go now?
What we're gonna do is fuck our brains out.
That's what we're gonna fucking do. Fuck around.
What the fuck is your beer problem, man?
LIZZY: Well, we want to be the best and the biggest.
WOMAN: What if it doesn't happen?
LIZZY: We know that we...
We had a great time trying.
- Do you know what?
- Oh-ho!
When you look at a city like Los Angeles,
Or the whole
United States in general,
You're gonna look and see there's millions of bands out there.
They look great, sound great, they're doing their own thing.
And all of a sudden, Poison...
What's Poison gonna do
That's gonna make us stick out of the crowd?
We're gonna have to...
We had an outrageous look
An outrageous sound, everything that we did was outrageous.
And all of a sudden people said,
"Wait a second."
"These guys have a great gimmick, but can they play?"
Well, they found out.
You don't sell...
Like you said, you don't sell three million records
If you can't play music.
WOMAN: Early on, did you guys ever think,
"God, we're never gonna make it?"
Before you got signed or anything?
[LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]
Now, listen, I came...
We got off the road
And I got a place in Marina del Rey.
Now, these guys are smart.
They spent their money wisely.
And I'm the little pig that went off with the money.
You know, I'm saying, spend it all, loud, abrasive.
You know, obnoxious.
Well, needless to say,
I have no money now.
If you love what you're doing,
Whether you have enough money to buy a Lemans or...
Lemans? Or buy, or buy a cheeseburger...
WOMAN: It's a Pontiac.
Okay.
No, what I meant is...
- Well...
- What?
A Lemans?
- No, whether you buy a...
- Maserati.
The thing is, it's not the money.
It's just if, you know, if you enjoy what you doing, it's fun
Because you never think about,
"Oh, I wanna have this,
I wanna have that."
You wanna be on stage and that's the reward, you know.
If you buy a car and it's a great car,
It looks great, it runs fast,
It's great if you can handle the speed.
If you can't handle the speed, you're gonna wreck.
And I think that's the same thing with success.
If you obtain all the success and then you can't handle it,
I think it just goes to waste.
You just sort of push the boat out into the water.
- WOMAN: What'll you do?
- Threw the anchor...
- Sink or swim.
- WOMAN: Be an accountant?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Did you have jobs...
- He's good at that.
Oh, sure.
WOMAN: You look like an accountant.
Now, what happens is, um,
The four of us, look to the...
Well, the three of us
Look to the other three...
The four of us look to the other three
One being an individual...
[BOTH LAUGH]
This is where the accounting comes in.
- No...
- [CONTINUE LAUGHING]
If I wasn't having fun,
I wouldn't do it.
I'd stop most definitely.
WOMAN: Even if it meant not having the money?
I've already got the money.
That's not why we're in it.
- You're not in it for the money?
- Mm-mm.
- What are you in it for?
- Rock and roll.
I mean, I mean, I mean, if someone's gonna make money,
We wanna make it, you know, on us.
But I mean, we're a rock and roll band.
- We love what we do.
- So, you're in it for the music?
I'm in it for the money
No, I'm not... No.
[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
[MAN SINGING]
WOMAN: So there was Poison, multi-million dollar band,
Out there on the street, handing out flyers?
That's what we used to do, this is how we did it actually.
We would, um...
During the day we would rehearse
And at night we'd go to clubs, you know, and hand stuff out.
We'd, you know, we'd try to look all cool and stuff
And just go, "Hey, yeah, come out and see the band."
At night we'd go back,
Throw on our jeans and be out there till 5:00 in the morning.
You know what I'm saying?
Like, trying so no one knew what we looked like then.
You know, putting all our flyers up and wallpapering it.
And along would come another band and cover it up
And then, you'd sneak back and it's a war!
Gotta promote, promote, promote, promote.
- Take out ads.
- I'm just advertising.
- What's the name of your band?
- Sex.
- Shotgun Wedding.
- Vixen.
- Terror.
- Gypsy and the Troubadour.
- Tommy Rot.
- Velocity.
- Tough.
- Tough.
- BOTH: Dirty Blonde.
- Wet Cherry.
The baddest band in the fucking universe!
- Metaldork.
- Untimely Death.
- Cryptic Slaughter!
- Jaded Lady.
I like passing out flyers
Because it's a good opening line on chicks.
'Cause you know, you can't walk up to a girl
And say,
"Um, you know what time it is?"
That ain't cool.
So you give 'em a flyer and they know you're in a band.
They know you're not a roadie.
- We don't have our flyers yet.
- Most people...
We don't have enough money to get them printed. Um...
We don't make any money off this...
MAN: Fifty percent of the girls take them.
The guys, they just throw them down.
Check this out, man, a guy gives me a flyer, right?
He gives me a flyer,
"Hey, all right, cool,
I'll be there! All right!"
"Cool, I'll come check out your band."
And he walks about 10 feet down the street
And I fucking wrinkle the shit up, throw it on the ground.
Well, we finally got our flyers.
We met a chick that, um, had a little bit of money.
We had her empty out her purse.
[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS]
Most of them just got out of high school
And they don't know what to do and they can't get real jobs
'Cause they don't look right for real jobs.
WOMAN: What do you do for a living?
Um, I'm a professional musician.
I work at Mrs. Fields Cookies.
Legal secretary.
I work for the
LA Unified School District.
We have a real sense of responsibility.
And we're tax payers.
And in fact, are very prominent in the business world.
We are also heavy metal rockers.
And we love it.
I don't work.
I can't stand work.
WOMAN: Um, what was the last job you had?
Uh, I've never had a job.
Is it a drag not having money? Yeah.
So, you're always hurting for money?
Uh, yeah!
Once you have money, you realize
That it's not really important.
What money gives you the opportunity to do
Is to forget about money.
I'd rather get rich at playing music than
Than get rich doing, uh, plumbing.
'Cause I don't wanna work until I'm 60
And die poor at 70.
And have a fat wife bitching at me and thirty kids.
I wanna do my own thing.
I'd like to have an apartment
Where we have carpeting on the floor.
'Cause, uh,
Mike picks his nose a lot and he has no place to put it.
Did you go to high school?
No, I dropped out seventh grade.
- How come?
- I don't know.
I just couldn't handle people telling me what to do.
Disobedient boys.
That's what we are.
WOMAN: And why are you rebellious?
Went to Catholic school for 12 years.
You know, they talk about these big famous bands
Tearing apart hotel rooms and stuff.
The only time we've ever been able to stay in a hotel room
We tore the shit out of it, but it just came natural.
I remember once when I read
Poison jumped on the glam band wagon.
[LAUGHING]
WOMAN: You don't think you did?
We built the first wheel on that freaking wagon any way.
Well second, all right,
Billy, Allison...
Men and makeup are where it's at.
Me personally, I might wear a little bit of eyeliner
To bring out my eyes because they're not that big,
But I'm not into wearing lipstick. Lipstick isn't me.
It's a turn off for me to kiss a guy that's got
Redder lipstick than I do.
You know, it's just a way of life now.
'Cause most guys, they don't know how to put it on.
They're dudes.
They're real clumsy.
It's like putting on high heals,
You're gonna fall all over the place, right.
I used to go down the corner and uh,
Hide my clothes underneath my jeans
And put on my makeup in that corner in the car,
By candle light.
And they got that certain look
That dazzles those little cutie girls.
And then they put on make up
And we're talking sizzle with these guys.
What I do is
I take tips from girls.
I'll, I'll let put my make up on, you know.
I kinda, I get into it, you know.
Kinda turns me on a little.
I'm, I'm not into that personally
But you know, if it sells our albums and records, yes.
You know, if a guy came to pick me up
For a baseball game or something and was wearing makeup
I probably wouldn't answer the door.
I don't like it. I like a man that looks like a man.
Do people look at you a lot?
Yeah, well, that's the idea.
It, it brings out bi-sexual tendencies
Because, women do like women no matter what people say.
My ma used to think
I was a transvestite, you know?
She'd, uh, check in there, you know,
Make sure I was not wearing her clothes and as such...
My mom still thinks I'm going through a phase in my life.
And that she says,
"Why don't you come home"
"And cut your hair, you know,"
"Like the little boy
I used to know."
WOMAN: What do you think about the pretty rock and roll stars?
Good luck to them if they're pretty, wish I was.
We've never gone out and put lipstick on
And stuff like that and put hair spray
So it looks like a truck blowing past us going 90, you know.
It's the theatrical effect.
I guess it's cool.
It's when they wear it off stage and try and pat you on the ass,
It worries me.
You know, sometimes it worries me.
I've had a lot of guys whistle at me thinking I was a chick...
When I see a it's a guy, I go back to the 18 year old girl.
If I'm driving in my car and somebody
Is at the back of me, you know, honking at me...
Sometimes I like to, you know, freak them out
You know, kinda give them a little wave
And then they come by and see me and I'm just like, yeah...
I just do a double twist, but then I make sure I keep walking.
The older we get, the uglier we get,
The more makeup we got to put on, you know what I'm saying?
It gets worse,
It doesn't get any better.
[STEVE SINGING]
Dude look like a lady...
All you girls out there, I want you to show us your breasts.
Hello, Cathouse.
WOMAN: So, tell me about
Cathouse, Rikki?
There's more girls here than anywhere in the world.
And we play rock 'n' roll, all we do...
Now we don't like add in,
Some clubs will play a little bit
Of rock 'n' roll we play only rock 'n' roll.
And it's just a real big fun, sleazy place.
Cathouse, welcome home,
They left a while ago, now they're fucking rock stars,
Faster Pussycats!
[FASTER PUSSYCATS
PLAYING CATHOUSE]
Let's go across the tracks
Where pussy ain't no feline
Rev up my Chevy
I'm gonna pay to play
Baby Lickity-split
I like that taste
I push ahead
And I fall behind
I'm just a good Good Tom
I just wanna stay
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
I had the best piece
Of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
WOMAN: So, why do you guys come to Cathouse?
It fucking rocks bitches...
Rock, heavy metal...
Party, drinks...
Faster Pussycats,
Guns 'N' Roses, LA.
It's what American rock 'n' roll is all about.
You want to know what rock 'n' roll is about
Come to the Cathouse.
'Cause rock 'n' roll is about a lot more than just music.
It's more than music, it's just an attitude, you know.
Me and my room mate
Needed a place where we could, uh,
Have a party and not worry about the neighbors
And getting free drinks
And a place where we can meet strippers.
WOMAN: So, could you call this place a pickup joint?
Definitely, that's, that's,
That's one of the main reasons it was opened up.
Where do you think
I found his ass, huh, Cathouse.
WOMAN: Describe some of the girls that come in here?
I like the girls that come in here.
Lot of blond girls come here, lot of girls that are
Look like they've come out of
Russ Meyers films.
They don't wear much clothes at the Cathouse.
We have this policy of never really keeping
The air conditioning on.
So, it gets really hot, so it's like...
They show a lot of flesh here.
WOMAN: I mean, I've seen girls walking around
In garter belts and bras.
I know, I like that.
Somebody came here once from Texas and they go,
"I don't believe it!"
"In Texas, we wear our lingerie in the bedroom."
"In the Cathouse they wear them out in the club."
You know, if you want to come here dressed really nice
That's okay, but...
You'll get in the club faster if you dress sleazy.
Let's go to the house
Where business is a pleasure
And as long as there's
A virgin
I won't go away
Now I'm a hard
Hard act to swallow
And she's my buried treasure
It'll be a long
Long time before I'm on my way
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
I had the best piece
Of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
WOMAN: So, who else comes here?
Aerosmith, Mötley Crüe,
Faster Pussycat of course.
KISS has been here a couple of times.
David Lee Roth was here last week.
WOMAN: So, what did you guys do to get signed?
- Like flyers?
- TAIME: Flyers.
We plastered them on the cars.
Plastered them on homes.
Stuffed them in their face.
They threw them down,
- we picked them up...
- Yeah, it sucked.
Give them to people that throw them down.
- Then you beat them up.
- Yeah and we kicked their ass...
WOMAN: What else did you do to try to get signed?
We tried to get Brent to blow the A&R department at the...
But it didn't work.
WOMAN: So, why are there
Like so many sexual references in your songs?
Because, Taime is a sexual monster.
- He's a dynamo.
- He is a sexual dynamo.
I'm a love machine.
WOMAN: So, how come you guys are so obsessed with sex?
- 'Cause we're young.
- We used, we used to be obsessed
With money, but we never got any so we had to like...
Give up on that.
WOMAN: What about drugs?
You use drugs?
- Uh, no.
- Alcohol.
- Aspirin, shit like that...
- Aspirin, Advil.
WOMAN: So what makes your band different than the rest
Of the bands around?
Tell me that?
Because we all have very large penises.
And we don't wipe our butt so it smells really bad.
WOMAN: So why are you in rock 'n' roll?
I'm just doing this till I can be
A manager at McDonald's or something.
I'm just, I'm just purely lazy, that's why I do this.
- Are you making a lot of money?
- No.
- No.
- People, people on the road go,
"Give me your scarf, give me your hat."
Nobody ever gives me any money.
Give me your jewelery.
We get a $1,000 a night a show
At an average we play four shows a week,
It cost us $2,500 to be on the road.
WOMAN: So at this point...
We don't make any money...
We just love doing it.
You know, not until,
We're new.
[FASTER PUSSYCATS PLAYING
BATHROOM WALLS]
Saw your number written
On the wall
Said for a good time call
Call 555-7688
Hey, baby, I can't wait
I got your number off
The bathroom wall
WOMAN: You just got back from a European tour.
- What was that like?
- I was in a room with Taime.
I mean, the rooms in Europe are really small.
The beds are right next to each other.
And all the girls that you bring in, like, had
- Crazy stuff.
- Had great fucking hairy arms...
More than me.
They'd like, hit me in the nose while I was asleep.
It was really gross.
WOMAN: You mean, he brings girls
And have sex when you're in the room?
We got, we, we only got three rooms.
You know, we gotta share.
And I had no choice
To put another dime
In the telephone,
'Cause that bitch is alone at home
I got your number off the bathroom wall
We got your number off the bathroom wall
And I decided it was about time
I made the call
We played in San Francisco
And we got pelted with rocks and garbage.
Taime broke someone's nose with a fucking mic stand.
- Well, they were mean.
- Boom!
They were throwing rocks at us and stuff, and...
WOMAN: What does it feel like when they don't like you?
Oh, we shove it in their face and tell them to eat shit.
'Cause if they don't like it, tough luck, you know.
- Eat a bag of shit.
- Eat a full bag of shit, buddy.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[SONG ENDS]
WOMAN: You are the definitive hard rock band
That really set the standards.
How do you feel about that?
I love it. I think, you know, we took it to the mountain
And it's still there.
It's rhythm and blues, it's twos and fours,
It's fucking, you know.
You can really fuck to a good Aerosmith song.
It's R&B. It's those twos and fours. It's...
[SCATTING]
- JOE: It's the swing.
- It's the swing.
It's the jazz of it all.
WOMAN: Did you look at The Dolls and say,
"Gee, they've got a good look.
We should look like that"?
Oh, yeah. I mean, I was in awe.
I loved it.
David Johansen had at least a thousand Mick Jagger lookalikes
And had lips for miles.
I mean, that guy could swallow the earth.
And has.
WOMAN: Did you try to make a comeback to make money?
- 'Cause you were running out.
- Shit, yes. Undoubtedly.
Yeah?
Well, you know, we not in...
I mean, you gotta
Buy your guitar strings somewhere, you know.
- Are you making a lot of money?
- Yeah.
WOMAN: Have you made a lot of money in your day?
Yeah. Yeah. Millions.
- You have?
- Oh, yeah.
- Where's it now?
- Went up my nose.
I must have snorted up all of Peru.
To survive the '60 and the '70s, it's like a fucking miracle.
WOMAN: You think you could have been dead?
Oh, God, I was several times.
We've used drugs for so many years,
It's like, you know, you burn out the punch card you know.
I mean, you've only got so many drinks in your life.
I think I used all of mine in 35 years, you know.
I was looking forward to having
A few sips on the porch when I get older,
But it ain't, it ain't in the cards, you know.
Joe and I are the toxic twins, baby.
- No one has been that, uh...
- Are you proud of it?
Uh, no.
You know, uh, no one...
Yes, I went through it, but no, not all people...
You know, they might think that that's the way to do it,
You know, and that isn't the way.
That's not the way at all.
Because we painted ourselves into a major corner.
Yeah, we figured it was the only thing to do,
Is to clean up, you know.
- How long has that been?
- It's been 11 months now.
And how do you feel?
Oh, still hung over a little bit.
No, we're doing good.
We were feeling sick and tired of feeling sick and tired.
WOMAN: Do you feel now that you can still do it without drugs?
Positively better, too.
Keep it up longer.
It's like, you know, it's like jerking off.
When you're a young kid
And you first learn how to use that thing,
You know, you go...
[SPUTTERING]
But the older you get, the slow... You slow down, you know.
You get into the rhythm of it.
And you learn how to milk it for all it's worth.
And I think that's what Aerosmith...
That's where Aerosmith is right now.
I think we could do a good job of, of fucking.
WOMAN: Okay.
Um, how do you feel about
Other bands ripping you off?
I don't know if they rip us off.
I mean, I can't hear anybody that sounds like us.
WOMAN: Don't you hear the bands?
Yeah. Yeah, I hear them,
But I don't that, I don't hear that much Aerosmith
As other people do. Aerosmith, to me, is really definitive.
Maybe some of the attitude some of the bands have.
Which is cool.
We stole it from other people.
It's almost like Tyler said one time. You know what I mean?
He said that... He said,
"With rock and roll..."
He goes, "In history, you know, everyone's doing something"
"Someone else already did.
So you're repeating yourself."
"But you're doing it with your own style."
WOMAN: Do you get mad if a band copies your style?
No. Good luck to them.
Maybe they'll do something that we can copy later.
I can think of a few that
I would like to have about now.
Right about here.
To be perfectly honest, nobody's original.
Nobody's original out there.
We're all thieves.
Some of them are just pure plagiarists.
I won't mention any names.
Their initials start with...
[BUZZER BEEPS]
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
And it's nice to know that you made some mark on music.
KISS supported Black Sabbath in the early '70s
And it was the first time
I ever really saw
A magnificent stage production with theatrics.
I mean, how incredible!
They were the... They were the forerunners of today, you know.
I think it is very important to be an innovator.
And since we were the first to do any of this,
It's, it's fun to still be doing it.
As far as I'm concerned, still doing it better
Than any of the bands that are copying us.
WOMAN: Why do you put
Those scarves on your microphone stand?
So I can wipe my nose.
Blow my nose.
WOMAN: What do you think when you see guys
Putting scarves all over their microphone stands?
- I don't know.
- Steve should get a royalty.
- Why is that?
- He was doing it a long time ago
I mean, if I write something,
I get a royalty for it
If someone else uses it.
Sorry, Steven.
Yeah!
WOMAN: So, Bobby, what do you have
To say to people who might think
That maybe your music isn't totally original?
His brothers...
[ALL LAUGH]
There's more bands in LA
Than there are anywhere else in the world
Because most of the record companies and labels
And high management corporations are based in Los Angeles.
A lot of the people who are... who play in bands
Aren't originally from Los Angeles.
Good evening.
We're Seduce from Detroit.
[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
It's like, playing and driving sort of goes hand in hand.
You know, you do a five grand launch from a dead stop.
Same thing as when you walk out in front of a crowd
And everybody's like...
[IMITATES CROWD]
You know?
Same blast, you know?
It's just a rush of adrenaline.
WOMAN: Are you doing it for the money?
No. If I was in it for the money,
I would have left a long time ago.
- You know?
- Are you in it for the fame?
That would be nice.
But you know, it's just like something, uh...
I do... I enjoy doing it.
You know, it's like...
WOMAN: Are you in it for the chicks?
No, at first I might have thought it'd been like that,
But then, you realize that
Half the chicks that are gonna be out there,
That you're gonna be with,
Aren't worth the time anyway, you know.
Well, she wanted to get married,
She wanted me to have the nine to five lifestyle.
The marry, go normal, kinda, you know...
If you're gonna bump into some chick
And you just pull into town and she's gonna fuck you,
You know she's fucked everybody else
From this star on down, so what's the point?
I mean, that's pretty much conquered ground, you know.
[PLAYING HEAVY METAL MUSIC]
You go hungry, you go broke...
But if you believe in yourself,
You'll fucking make it, you know.
WOMAN: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
Retired.
Living some place nice.
My stocks working for me, investments, bonds, securities.
You know, shit like that.
I'm responsible.
I got long hair, but fuck,
I'm a businessman, you know.
Yes, I've devoted all my life to rock and roll.
WOMAN: Does that ever get scary for you?
Yeah, 'cause I wonder sometimes
If I, uh, if I wind up 45 years old
And I never did anything or something like that...
WOMAN: Why do people devote their
Whole lives to rock and roll?
Well, if you want to become famous,
It usually takes your whole life to get there, you know?
I mean, to keep on going and going and going,
It's like, "You're almost there, you're almost there",
And then it's like, "Oh, no!"
Crash Landing, it's about us.
We, we wrote this music for it
And I was thinking about an idea for the song.
And there was a plane crash and, uh,
We just thought about, you know,
It'd be kind of neat to write the song about that.
And what it would be like if you were the pilot of the plane
And like, what you'd be going through
As you're, you know, getting ready to crash.
[BAND PLAYING CRASH LANDING]
Flying high up in the sky
Who understands
The reasons why
That I
I was lost
Tried to find my way back home
Suddenly I'm all alone
In the night
In the night
My engines started shutting down
My tail starts spinning
Round and round
Total loss of all control
Terror grips, grips my soul
I'm headed straight,
Straight for the ground!
Crash landing
WOMAN: Have you said,
"I feel like quitting,"
"'cause we haven't made it yet?"
Uh, probably every day
I say that.
I'm busting my balls at this.
Of course I wanna make it, you know.
I mean, you know, whatever it takes, man.
Last drop of blood, you know.
'Cause I'm in it, you know, till the death or whatever.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
WOMAN: Who's the biggest band in Detroit?
Us.
WOMAN: Why did you get into
Rock and roll in the beginning?
'Cause I noticed you got lots of girls.
Girls. All sizes, all shapes.
Big, small, short, tall.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
Hallelujah!
Jesus Christ, when we toured with KISS,
They were like, like monsters, man.
There were lines of chicks
Outside their rooms every night, you know.
What the...
What's the matter with me?
I'm trying to pull the stragglers, you know.
WOMAN: Talk to me a little bit about
The girls that approach you.
- Oh...
- Where'd you hear that?
Why, did somebody say something?
[ALL LAUGH]
WOMAN: What do you think about groupies?
I love them!
- Amazing.
- They're great.
Just amazing.
You know how I mean.
They keep a young man hard.
It's a way of life, you know.
STEVEN: It's like your alter ego.
They're doing the same thing you are.
I mean, you're in a band and you love it.
You love the music that you're playing.
Uh, you know, you see them freaking out and loving it.
It's just, you know, it just reinforces the way you feel.
In the '60s they used to call them groupies.
I like to call them the fleas and ticks of rock and roll.
That's, that's my motto.
The, the best groupies are in Salt Lake City.
And, uh, I've had four of them at a time.
WOMAN: So you, you get into group sex?
- Uh...
- Yeah, it's happened.
It's happened.
We've had four or five since we've been here.
WOMAN: How long have you been here?
- Five weeks.
- Five weeks.
WOMAN: Do you often see girls take off
Their shirts at your concerts?
Yeah. It's, uh, it's our form of salute.
We go, "Hello."
And they go, "Hello."
Leads me to an interesting story.
One day, I was in my hotel room
And Bret's room was next to mine.
And I heard this girl screaming and pounding on the door.
This girl with really long hair, sitting...
Sitting in a bus, by the side of us.
And we don't know her.
Suddenly she goes bang and falls on the floor...
So she says, "I'll only stay a while." All right.
So we become fast friends, we swap spit...
He gets her by the legs and I get her by the shoulders.
I get her by her shoulders...
I get so far up with her and she starts wobbling and scre...
I thought, "What's the matter with her?"
I finally got out of bed and I said,"To hell with this!
"I'm gonna go, go do something about it."
I walk outside, the door...
His door opens and the girl comes running out.
So I don't know how to get rid of this girl.
She says,
"What do you want of me?"
And I suddenly realize
I had my foot on her hair.
She was there for 15 minutes trying to get out of his room.
I said, "Go up to the 23rd floor where the, uh, road crew is"
"And take care of them."
She was having an epileptic fit,
I'm like, "My God!"
[SPASMING]
If I woke up and looked at me in the morning,
I'd be screaming, "Dude, you get outta here."
And I don't know what happened,
But the next day the road crew was very friendly.
WOMAN: Have you ever said to yourself,
"I could fall in love with this groupie"?
[GIRL GIGGLES]
Have I ever...
Have you ever said to yourself,
"I could fall in love with this groupie"? Yeah.
Probably not because I'd have to think that
Somebody in every band had also.
Paul Stanley said one time that if you're gonna make it
And be successful, you gotta get rid of your women.
If this is the way you wanna live,
Then you can live like this.
WOMAN: And we can safely say that,
Since this is a documentary film,
That you actually do live like this?
As often as I can.
Guys in the metal scene are, are fun.
And you can take advantage of them
Just as guys can take advantage of the girls in the metal scene.
You know what I'm saying?
In heavy metal music, women are portrayed to be abused.
Um, they're kind of, uh, being bound in chains.
Many of the styles portray them as having handcuffs on,
Leg irons, being locked in cages.
There's a very brutal aspect
Towards the woman in heavy metal.
'Cause it very much appeals to the male macho image.
I don't think people take girls seriously in this sort of music.
I don't know why that is.
'Cause there hasn't been anybody to prove
That girls can really, really rock.
WOMAN: Can girls play rock and roll as good as guys?
- You bet.
- Damn right, we can.
Shit.
We rock. We kick ass.
WOMAN: You get a lot of chicks from being in a band?
Oh, fuck, you get all the chicks from being in a band.
Especially the singer.
I get the most.
Well, that's fine.
That's a stereotype.
The minute a girl goes out with a bunch of guys, she's a slut.
- What's your favorite past time?
- Sex.
Rock and roll and sex.
Girls. Girls.
Favorite past time.
Big tittied.
What's your favorite past time?
- Sex.
- Definitely.
All the time.
Every day, at least three or four times.
WOMAN: What kind of guys do you like?
Um, musicians, unfortunately.
WOMAN: Why?
Because they're irresponsible assholes, but they look good.
When I'm playing, they seem so mesmerized
By what I'm doing on stage.
Instantly, they're mine, you know.
They have attitude.
I know that sounds kind of weird, but I like attitude.
My personal taste?
I like sluts.
I like slutty girls.
I like girls that will take off all their clothes
Right in front of me and dance in my face.
That turns me on.
WOMAN: Does this happen a lot, Matthew?
Yeah. It's a rock and roll band.
I mean, uh...
It's all a combination.
It's great to fell that hair above you, you know.
Falling down.
WOMAN: So, when you're on stage you're wearing the hair...
No, in bed.
- Or on the floor or the kitchen.
- The bathroom, on the table.
WOMAN: Are you afraid of getting AIDS?
I never really thought about it.
You can't screw someone now, and think,
"I just laid that chick."
Because she's gonna go,
"Honey, you're dead." You know?
You know, I, I myself,
I go with girls
Whose step-dads are gynecologists.
So that really helps out a lot.
- With the AIDS problem?
- Yeah. Yeah, a lot of that.
WOMAN: And birth control?
Um, I don't really worry about that.
WOMAN: A lot of girls chase after you?
Yes, they do.
You chicks take care of me a lot.
Why, I just had this chick sow up my pants today or else
You guys could see my dick hanging out the bottom here.
WOMAN: She didn't do a very good job dude.
If it's not money,
It's taking us here, taking us there.
- You know,
- Buying us new clothes...
- and boots.
- Yeah, got some new pants.
It's kind of a rule that, chicks don't get in the house
Unless they have a sack of groceries with them.
You know?
Yeah, let me tell you, when your stomach's growling,
You haven't had anything for a couple of days, you don't...
All of a sudden, your moral values just sorta like...
Okay, hon, if you want to pay for dinner.
That's fine with me.
WOMAN: You know a lot of guys in this scene
Let girls take care of them financially.
What do you thing about that?
I think that's sad.
Sounds horrible.
In a sense it's a form of prostitution.
WOMAN: Would you ever go out with a girl just so that, you know
She would pay for some food even if you didn't like her.
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, I would.
- WOMAN: Isn't that prostitution?
Uh, no, I wouldn't see it that way.
- No.
- I wouldn't see it that way. No.
WOMAN: Would you let some guy pay for you?
No.
WOMAN: What are you going to do for them?
Anything they want right now that I can do.
WOMAN: What do you do for them?
You know, when I have a little money
I'll be them the nice things some pretty furs...
And the, the cars and the Rolls Royces.
And the whole, the whole shebang.
- You're gonna remember them?
- Oh, yeah!
WOMAN: How long have London been together?
- Too fucking long. Since 1979.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, this is like
The uh, training school for rock stars.
'Cause see we get somebody in the band
And uh, as soon as they leave they become rock stars.
WOMAN: So, who else was in your band?
Couple of dudes from
Guns N' Roses.
A dude from, uh, W.A.S.P.
And, uh, Nikki Sixx from Mötley Crüe.
Freddy Coury of Cinderella.
Well, I like to tell you that, uh,
We do appreciate you guys being here
And we would like to have you're co-operation
To make us look bitching.
All right!
You see, we've been in this town for so long
That we're like a cheap hooker on the street.
Nobody wants to know about us.
So, what happens is we, we have a big following out of town,
We come back here, they offer us 50 bucks
To play the Troubadour or whatever.
- On a Tuesday.
- On a Tuesday.
But, we will do it for a bar tab.
So, you guys are gonna be in the picture right here, so...
If you can just like...
Stick your hands up in the air and make yourselves look...
Show us your under-alls.
All right!
Oh! You want to hear about Arizona.
Well, I just found out when
I was in my hotel room that,
That, that oral sex was illegal.
- Now that fucking...
- By three years.
That fucking bummed me out.
He loves to eat pussy.
Can you imagine.
You're under arrest for...
Now, come on.
We were rather shocked to hear that really.
Yeah, but unfortunately we did break the law
An awful lot when we were in Arizona.
Girls in other cities are great
Because uh, it's always two or three
That are totally loaded with money.
Here's what London is...
Our dicks get real hard for gold cards.
They do. They do.
No.
You guys are fucking losing it, man.
You're not here for me.
You're here for you know what.
Women make you feel very, very good
When they're out in front of you and they just start fucking
Sucking their own hands and sucking their own fingers
And throwing notes at you and taking their tops off.
Oh, my God!
Not more fog.
First of all, girls like it when you talk dirty to them.
Especially right here.
Okay. You just tell them you want to bang them...
Kiss their toes, lift their butt up in the air
And you look at her with the lights...
We are not role models for your life.
My hands are tied
My back's to the wall
Nowhere to hide
No escape from it all, yeah
Pick of the town
Living in the fast lane
Running around
Well, they need those money skies, yeah
Times I like new love
There's a place to go
And I went with this chick.
Well, this chick is all weird.
She was using these cuffs
And there was nowhere to cuff me up.
And she wanted to cuff me up.
And all there was, was a desk with handles.
So she used the handle of a fucking drawer.
WOMAN: Why did she wanna cuff you up?
Because she wanted to sit there and play with herself.
- Okay?
- With you cuffed to the desk?
Yeah. Shit, I loved it.
Anyway, she left me there.
I fell asleep.
And I'm like this.
Ooh, breakout!
Hey!
WOMAN: When was the last time you had a job?
Eight years ago. [LAUGHING]
We don't work, this is...
We play music.
Well, I've never had a job.
The girls have always,
The girls have always been very generous.
Well, I'm currently like,
I'm still employed.
I'm a professional gynecologist.
WOMAN: No, when was the last time you had a job.
Well, uh, this is my job.
Uh, as far as I'm concerned this is what I do.
I believe in it, you know, this is rock 'n' roll. I do this.
So, I mean,
I don't consider that, uh,
I'm like, lazy or something
'cause I don't do a job.
Because I bust my fucking ass doing rock and roll.
WOMAN: Do you always have money?
Sometimes we do and sometimes we don't.
We're, we're in debt for 100 grand.
Right now, yes, we are.
But we're getting out of that.
WOMAN: How could you be in debt for 100 grand?
We bought a lot of equipment.
Our last album we did was financed by this guy
Who was in jail, right?
[LAUGHING]
Yeah, but...
He's out now.
And now he wants his money.
All right. See this?
You know, that bullshit going on out there
For the fucking Russians, huh?
I'm sick of listening to these motherfuckers.
[DRUM ROLL]
You know, how they say
The Russians are coming over here.
They cause shit.
Ha ha, surprise.
Uh oh, this fucker's tough.
MAN: Burn it.
Come on, mother fucker.
I ain't got all day.
This song is for the Russians.
This is called Russian Winter.
[SCREAMING]
Yeah!
We were making flame pots for this song, Russian Winter.
And what we did was, we uh,
Wanted big flames, so we put
A lot of extra gun powder and flash powder together.
So, we basically got your uh, standard concussion bombs.
- Yeah.
- Six at once.
Snow bound, snow bound,
Just like a Russian winter
Yeah!
- Hell bound
- Hell bound
Beware of the Russian winter
In the USA
That's why it's snowing in America.
Oh and when your eyes are dim
You know the beast crawls in
To make you suffer
Again and again
I left for Chicago, so called to do business.
I went and did nothing.
This cop was sending us...
Douche bag. I mean, this guy was an idiot.
Anyway...
I get in to get to the car and he goes, "Get out of here!"
"Come on, get your ass out of here."
And I go, "Fuck you!"
- To the cop.
- Oh, yeah!
He was a fucking...
If you would have seen this guy, this is not an alley cop.
Alley cops, they look good and they look big
And they look nuts and they're young
And pissed off and they are ready to kick ass.
And I'm sitting in the cab with the door open
And he grabs me by the hair.
And that was it.
I go, motherfucker, is this anything to grip,
I can't you know...
WOMAN: What happened, let me see your eye.
So he hit me in the eye.
Right here, but it's cool,
I whacked him about six times.
And then,
I got my ass kicked after that.
- Snow bound
- Snow bound
Just like a Russian winter
Yeah!
- Hell bound
- Hell bound
Just like a Russian winter
- Snow bound
- Snow bound
Just like a Russian winter
Yeah!
- Hell bound
- Hell bound
WOMAN: Where do you guys live?
- Well, uh...
- You mean right now?
Right now,
I don't have a steady home. No.
- WOMAN: Okay.
- We're kinda on the road
- Kinda in transit right now.
- We're strollers.
'Cause I wanted to shoot you,
I wanted to go
To one of your homes.
But you didn't have one.
Yeah, that's a problem for us.
It's usually a restaurant or a bar.
Yeah, sure we'll be there.
We show up and we're decked out and good to go.
And you'll never know what happened.
Where did they go?
WOMAN: Do you think about yourselves as rock stars?
BOTH: No.
WOMAN: What's it like being a living legend?
Kids out there think, you got a guitar,
You make a hit record
And you make millions of dollars and
You just live happily ever after.
It isn't that way at all.
It's like, very hard work.
Very hard break.
You get your rewards and, and, and things...
You do get a lot of things like, gold disk, platinum disk,
Cars, houses and...
You know, then you got things like divorces,
Management ripoffs, fatigue, drugs, alcohol.
You know, hang overs and you got to go on the next one
You've been up all night burning you bridges
And you got to go, "Hi, guys."
"It's good to be back on stage again."
You know, you'll be feeling like crap inside, you know?
Very often I ask them what do they think I would be doing
If I wasn't into rock 'n' roll.
And I, I keep saying, you know,
My answer for that is
I'd probably be in prison.
Why is that?
Because I just want... I didn't want to get a regular job.
I couldn't conform to any system
And I didn't want to get a job...
I've had several jobs in factories
And, you know, different jobs.
But rock and roll has got this sort of a...
An outlaw-ish thing with it.
You can do what you wanna.
You don't have to get up
And listen to some big, fat baldy old fart
Telling you to take this box and stick it over there.
WOMAN: So, tell me about, you know, what happened
When all of a sudden you got rich
And you could buy the...
Everything you wanted.
What happened, it didn't work out exactly like Cinderella.
We started to think we were thugs.
All went out and bought fast cars and everything.
We had a manager and that's because...
Because we came from the back streets of Birmingham,
We didn't have any...
Much of a business education.
We let him con us as it was...
We got ripped off for lots of money in the early days.
But we didn't care.
We were staying in America,
Having fun, screwing as many groupies as we could,
Smoking as much dope,
Getting just, you know, out of it in general.
Basically having a good time.
Those were the fun years because we...
Until we suddenly realized on day,
"Hey, we must be earning a lot more"
"Than this guy's actually giving us."
WOMAN: So, it's not all a pretty story?
It's hard bloody work and you gotta be a businessman.
And I'm not a businessman, you know.
And I'm very fortunate to this day.
Now my wife is my manager.
She knows the business.
While I, I don't know the business side of rock and roll.
I don't wanna know it either.
When we came to America
We thought like, the drugs and all that
Was just a part of the gig, you know.
You know, you just get stoned and just get fucked up
And make your gig and all that.
And what happened with Black Sabbath?
We all ended up junkies and alcoholics and everything.
Like, the drummer ended up in a rehabilitation center.
I did for a while and...
And in the end disaster happens.
It's uh, it's inevitable for having disasters.
'Cause it's like drugs, they're okay at that time,
But we outgrew them, you know.
We just... You know, we took LSD, we took cocaine,
We took vast amounts of marijuana.
It is fun at the time, but then it became all just sort of...
"This isn't a very good idea anymore."
WOMAN: So you have a more stable life now?
- No.
- [BOTH LAUGH]
Back in Control is an organization
That is designed to
Show parents how to regain control of their child's behavior.
- Right there, sir.
- Okay, turn around.
- Turn around.
- Go ahead, feel me up.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over?
One of the things that we have found
Which we call "De-metalling",
Is a program that actually gets the kid out of heavy metal.
- [ROCK MUSIC PAYING]
- Wait a minute.
DARLYNE: We have certain rules.
Removal of heavy metal albums or tapes,
Um, not allowing the child to dress in any style
Of heavy metal, which would mean
Taking these kinds of things away from him.
Not allowing him to wear the heavy metal t-shirts
That depict the band members
With pictures of monsters or skeletons
Or whatever, graves, on them.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Come, come, come on.
This right here, just covers the forearm
And again, it's just used as a garment.
But it basically talks about an image related to heavy metal,
Which is one of power.
Come on! Oh, dude,
I gotta go.
Cup the hands, cup the hands.
Cup your hands.
This also is worn over the forearm.
And this was homemade.
As you can tell, it has
Just screws and nuts in it, a piece of sheet metal.
MAN: I used to be drunk.
I used to have lighters...
MAN 2: She's not a druggie.
She's clean.
This right here is a collar that is worn around the neck.
And also to prevent any kind of choke hold
If you get involved in a riot
And the police are trying to to get...
Contain the, uh, situation.
- Spread your legs, come on.
- Come on!
For youngsters on probation, under probation supervision,
Oftentimes this will constitute a weapon.
And they are not allowed to wear this.
WOMAN: Have you heard of people getting hurt with these things?
Oh, yes.
Check my ass as much as you want.
[SCREAMING]
The devil horns.
Black Sabbath, yeah!
Many kids, if you ask them,
They'll say,
"Well, that mean heavy metal."
It looks like two pingers poking up.
- It's kinda like a horn.
- You know how to do that?
No, like this.
No, like this.
It's the two fingers up
To represent the authority of the devil.
People would go, yeah, yeah, yeah...
I don't know, it's the sign of evil I guess.
Or it could be the sign of Satan according to the Jesus crispies,
Outside the arena with their big Jesus posters.
The three fingers down
To represent the denial of the trinity.
This is Satan's head and this is his horns
And if you do this, you're absolutely possessed.
Also with in this hand gesture we have three sixes.
A six here, a six here and a six here.
Which represents the 666
In the book of Revelations in the Bible.
I like death and destruction and...
Frenzy and hatred.
Not that I like doing it or anything,
I just like reading about it
And hearing it, just like, you know...
Some one likes horror movies or novels.
WOMAN: So a lot of people would think you'd be a violent person.
- Are you?
- No, I'm not violent.
WOMAN: Do you think, Ozzy is a,
You know, messenger of the devil?
WOMAN: Does it bother you that
They accuse you of being satanic?
It pisses me off.
It, it does piss me off.
It's hard to tell what Ozzy's intentions are.
But the thing that we see is the behavior that results
From kids who take the lyrics literally.
WOMAN: So you're not really into the devil then, huh?
- Yes.
- [BOTH LAUGHING]
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
Hi, I'm Bill Gazzarri.
The godfather of rock 'n' roll.
And welcome to Gazzarri's
On the strip in Hollywood, California.
You can see when the public comes in,
They're normal.
After about a half hour of rock 'n' roll,
They're no longer normal.
They're jumping all over the place.
I mean, you have to pick them off the walls.
WOMAN: Tell me about the Gazzarri dancers
And the contest?
We started to have a Gazzarri dance contest
And then we started to have it every week
With the finals every year.
And then we started giving out
The title Miss Gazzarri dancer of the year.
There's been so much fucking bullshit
About this contest being fixed,
That I'm gonna make damn sure you all understand this.
At the end of the contest
When they announce all the winners.
The judges sheets will be available at the front door,
For any motherfucker to inspect.
And I don't want to take care of all the fucking bullshit
About this contest being fixed.
And we are missing a couple of asses here.
It's a classy place.
And, it's, it's on Sunset
And you think Beverly Hills is classy.
They can't hold a candle to this place.
Love machine grooves away
Grooves you in
Wanting accusation
[CROWD CHEERING]
WOMAN: You every find yourself
Wanting to wear ear plugs in here?
Well, I, I do put cotton in my ears when I come in.
But I hear the music better that way.
No complications
I know that you were dancing
With the best
That's right!
Oh, woman there loves you
She loves you
My name is Cindy Burmisa.
WOMAN: And how has it been being a Miss Gazzarri Dancer?
It has been the greatest time of my life.
WOMAN: What was the best part of it?
Getting up there in front of a million people
And really doing it.
WOMAN: What are you going to do now? Are you gonna, um...
I'm gonna continue on my modeling
And...
Um, hopefully I'll get on with my actressing.
Shooting some movies.
WOMAN: Do you feel bad that
You're almost finished with the titles?
Not at all.
I'll be happy to turn over my crown
And I hope the best for them.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Whoa, a woman
That will love you
Love ya
WOMAN: What do you get from winning the contest?
A feeling of accomplishment.
- Really?
- Money.
I think it's a catalyst for my future career.
WOMAN: If you win, what are you gonna do with the $1,000?
Um...
Hopefully invest it into something
Like a down payment on a condo.
That's what I'm trying to do right now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
WOMAN: Nadir, tell me whatyou thought of the dance contest.
I, you know, I like to watch a chick dance.
If she wants to dance, come over to my house and dance for me.
Not for a million dudes, you know.
[METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
Let it out!
Let it out!
Let it out!
Oh! You get a zero!
[LAUGHS]
Go, go!
WOMAN: What do you think?
Was the dance contest fun?
That's stupid.
Doesn't belong in music.
Get it away from me.
Fucking, get a comedian up there.
These guys are personal friends of mine.
There's Randy, I love him.
He's gonna be bigger than David Lee Roth,
Who started right here.
Help me bring on my pal Randy, and Odin.
Let's go.
Odin! Odin!
He's believed in us for a long time.
- That's right.
- For a very long time.
Odin! Odin! Odin!
Odin! Odin!
I mean, I know personally that I want...
I mean, I want to go
As big as like Zeppelin,
The Rolling Stones,
The Beatles or like that.
I mean, I don't want to be another band.
I don't want to be just another fucking band.
Odin! Odin!
- Odin!
- Odin! Odin! Odin!
Well, I just wanna be extremely wealthy.
I want to be remembered for the rest of my life
For my grandchildren's grandchildren's lives.
Odin! Odin! Odin!
They're gonna be very, very big in the rock and roll world.
Besides, the singer is a foxy guy.
[ODIN PLAYING LITTLE GYPSY]
Little Gypsy!
Take a trip into the city
Watching everything
That comes by me
My girl she's looking pretty
She's the new girl on the scene
Oh, I've been waiting
Waiting for my turn to come
Watch her move
Watch her groove
She's got me wrapped up on her tongue
Sing it, she's my girl
Lookin' good
I'll take the risk,
Until it's understood
- Gypsy
- Gypsy
- Gypsy
- Gypsy
She's my little gypsy
WOMAN: Randy, why do you wear pants
That don't have no butt in them?
Yeah.
'Cause it ventilates my scrotum sac.
Take a trip into the city
Watching everything
That comes by me
My girl she's looking pretty
She's the new girl on the scene
She's my girl
Lookin' good
I'll take the risk,
Until it's understood
WOMAN: So how long do you think till Odin gets signed?
- The next four to six months.
- Yeah?
- And then what's gonna happen?
- And then super stardom.
Super fucking stardom.
If you want to take me serious, you can,
If you don't want to take me serious, you don't have to.
But I'll say, this face,
People are gonna fucking remember it, okay?
And it's gonna go down in history. I know that.
I don't wanna be like Jim Morrison,
But I wanna go down in history like that.
- Or Robert Plant.
- MAN: That's right.
Or any of the really bigger people.
And I feel it's within us and within me.
- What if it doesn't happen?
- It's gonna happen.
She's my little
Gypsy!
WOMAN: Why do you girls hang out with this band?
- Because they have good music.
- Yeah.
And 'cause they're good looking.
Really good looking.
WOMAN: Do you guys ever get discouraged?
Yeah, there are times when we get really discouraged.
I mean, I've been known to be suicidal and stuff like that.
It's scary sometimes, you know, what I'm gonna be doing
In maybe five or ten years if it doesn't happen or...
WOMAN: Have you ever seriously tried to kill yourself?
I've come pretty close.
Yeah, I have, I have OD-ed and stuff like that.
Yeah, that's why I don't do drugs anymore
- and stuff 'cause...
- GIRL: Yeah, right...
[ALL LAUGH]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
You get frustrated when your potential
Isn't tapped into at the time, you know.
And you feel like you could be there and you're not,
And it's just... That's the frustration, you know.
It's like you have a one million dollar check in your hand
And you have no place to cash it.
WOMAN: And is that worth killing yourself for?
At times you can be when you think about
Being immortal superstars, yeah.
It can be.
I've never thought of killing myself but I thought of, uh...
Like going out and being a bum, you know, skid row.
You know, taking the easy way out.
WOMAN: So it's either a rock 'n' roll star or a bum.
- That's your, that's your trip.
- That's it.
I think we're ready for a
12 o'clock high!
[PLAYING 12 O'CLOCK HIGH]
Went to the distance
Waiting to see the truth
What have you got?
Now, I
Got what I want
The truth is what you see
When you're looking at me
You tried your luck
You failed the day
You'll never win
'Cause I'm the master of the day
See you at 12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock high
See you at 12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock high
Now, I
Am just what you want
Do it to me tonight
Do it right
So, I
Am just what you crave
Number one, I said
Got nothing to say
Sold out every pub we've ever played in the last two years,
Now we're being virtually ignored.
That's frustrating.
WOMAN: Is that worth killing yourself for
If you don't make it?
Well, there's nothing else that I can really do
Except music, you know.
And that's how I feel.
That's all I really wanna do in my life is music,
And if I can't do that
Then fuck everything else around me, really.
12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock high
Twelve o'clock high
WOMAN: Do you think that you're gonna be a rock star?
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm going to be a famous rock star, yeah.
Yeah. Yes, I wanna be a rock star.
Gonna be rock stars.
I'm going to be a rock star.
I am going to be.
We wouldn't mind, being rock stars.
But...
As long as, rock star is defined as rich and... rich.
I think that it'll come pretty easily for me.
You know, 'cause I'm different from everyone else.
WOMAN: What if you don't make it as a rockstar?
Oh, I will.
WOMAN: But if you don't, in 10 years,
What are you going to be doing?
See, I will though, see.
WOMAN: What if you don't make it?
- But I will.
- I will make it.
- For sure?
- I'm not gonna quit until I do.
The main key is perseverance.
And I will persevere.
That question is not in my mind.
The minute you doubt, is the minute you lose it.
What if I don't make it?
I'll find a vacant drainage ditch or something...
Lay my bed down.
I don't know...
End up on skid row or something,
I don't know.
I don't know where I'm gonna be.
WOMAN: Doesn't it worry you?
No.
I'm like him, that doesn't enter my mind.
I can't really,
I can't picture not making it.
You see, if you came and heard us, you'd really...
You'd think the same thing too.
WOMAN: That you are, definitely gonna make it?
Oh, yeah.
WOMAN: What if 10 years from now it doesn't happen?
I don't believe that,
That it won't, because you can do anything in life you want.
There ain't nothing in this world you can't do.
- Do you have a back up plan?
- No.
No such thing.
No back up.
I don't know how to do anything else.
We rock 'n' roll.
That's all we do.
I'm a singer.
- Well, I got no choice.
- Why?
We all fucked up in school.
We all, you know, we're just...
This is what we're here for.
WOMAN: What if you don't end up a rock star?
Well, if I don't, then I'll die trying.
What do you think your tombstone will say?
I don't want a tombstone,
I just...
I just want somebody to dig a ditch and throw me in,
"See you later, pal, have a good one".
WOMAN: When you were a little kid,
Did you want to be a rock star?
Yes, I did. Definitely.
She wouldn't let me.
I go, "Mom, can I take rock guitar?"
She says "Well..."
"No, you can't 'cause you will, you'll turn to one of those"
"Drug infested rock stars."
- Do you like touring?
- Yeah, I love it.
I met women.
Like...
In my whole term... four of them at a time.
Say "Hey, take your drawers off"
And if they don't, I call my security guard next door,
They come, he throws them right out.
"Get outta here".
WOMAN: What do you think about that, Sandy?
I don't think about it.
If you can tour one year,
If you can tour... one year,
It'll take four years off your life.
You know five, four years, five.
WOMAN: So, Chris, how many gold records do you have?
Shit, one, two, three, four, five, si...
I don't know. Who cares?
Who knows?
I don't know.
- So do you...
- Five, six, 10, 12, who cares?
- Do you consider yourself...
- A piece of crap.
Why?
Well, because, you know
I don't work a job
And I'm a piece of crap.
WOMAN: Does it bother you that this lifestyle
Is dangerous to your health?
Health?
What do you mean, health?
Look at me.
I look 40?
- How old are you?
I'm 29.
I'm what they call, an old fuck.
Look at my mom! Shit!
WOMAN: What do you think you're gonna
Be doing in 10 years from now?
Ten? I'll probably be dead.
You can come see my graveyard.
Mom, have a drink.
- Chris? Do you drink very much?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Pardon?
- Do you drink very much?
Yes, I do.
I'm a full blown alcoholic.
Just when he's awake.
I drink too much.
WOMAN: Okay, why do you drink that much?
'Cause I enjoy it.
Do you think a rock 'n' roll lifestyle
- turns you into an alcoholic?
- Yes, it does.
WOMAN: How much of that do you drink a day?
About...
- Five pints
- Of vodka?
Five quarts, pints, who cares?
I'm a happy camper.
WOMAN: Do you think, maybe, just kind of, you know...
Rock 'n' roll lifestyle is hard on you and that's why you drink?
I'm a full blown alcoholic
And why I drink, is 'cause... look...
What?
WOMAN: Why do you drink, Chris?
'Cause it makes me happy...
Happy.
I enjoy drinking.
I just enjoy life.
I'm the happiest son of a bitch and motherfucker, there ever was.
WOMAN: Why do you get so loaded though?
'Cause it's the only thing that...
Lets me get free, you know...
WOMAN: You think you might be covering up some pain?
Yeah, little bit.
WOMAN: Where would that be from,
I wonder?
Here... Do you like this label?
WOMAN: Let's not avoid the issue.
Where would that be from?
This...
Okay... here...
WOMAN: Do you wish... Chris?
Do you wish that you were...
A bigger star, than you are right now?
Do I wish what?
That you were a bigger star than you are?
Not really.
I wish I was a smaller star.
I don't dig being the person I am.
And...
I just don't like it.
I just don't...
Been the person who...
Who's like...
Excuse me...
Being who I am is like...
Here, watch.
I had a whiskey bottle the size of the Empire State building
In front of me all the time.
I have a disease called alcoholism
And drug... drug... drug dependency.
I am actually an alcoholic now,
I guess I think...
I'm probably about four on the
Richter scale of alcoholism.
I was always at about 3.2, at all times.
If I would've been stopped driving at any time,
Even if I hadn't anything to drink for two weeks,
I would still have been legally drunk.
I'd get tired of waking up
Hungover, having to do a couple of lines,
And a couple of beers, just to get moving, you know.
Which is where I was at...
Then you gotta get the act together
So you can go and cop dope.
WOMAN: What was the Betty Ford Clinic like?
Boring.
No, actually...
The educational value was okay, it made me realize
That I was an alcoholic and that I am a drug addict.
But still, I am an alcoholic.
You always are, you know.
- But you feel better now?
- No.
But after a while, when you do it so much,
It's like the same as the first time.
It turns into a... you know, it turns against you
- especially with drugs.
- Did rock 'n' roll do it to ya?
Yeah, well, I guess it did because
We got a free bottle backstage every show you see, so...
I mean you don't wanna leave the last
Quarter of the bottle so you tend to finish it up, you know.
The worst thing I can imagine is hurting yourself.
You may as well just jump off a building,
I mean what's the difference?
These bands really wanna make it.
They stay away from drugs, maybe these kids will do
The drugs that float for free, every once in a while
But that doesn't happen much.
It's just there is not enough time.
Most of the kids who wanna make it stay away from drugs.
- No, I'm not into drugs.
- I think drugs suck.
It's bullshit. We've seen it ruin a lot of people.
Personally, I find that I don't need drugs to have a good time.
All I need is loud music, and a lot of friends.
I don't think you can enjoy a show,
If you go and get wasted, you know,
Don't even remember the show the next day.
Basically, the metal is a drug to me
I don't need it to get strung out or anything, if I hear
Like Sabbath Volume Four, that is my drug.
You can't be a musician and a drug addict.
Neither one nor the other.
I don't know, people ask me if I am an alcoholic,
I guess you can consider me an alcoholic, I drink every day.
I don't think
I let it affect my life.
I show up for band practice,
I mean that's all that's important.
We do drugs, we do alcohol.
It doesn't mean you should do it.
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll used to be a fun thing to do
But it ain't any more.
You can play Russian Roulette for five years and
Never get hurt and then one time
You pull the trigger and it's all over.
The thing is, belief in yourself should be the drug, really.
Your confidence is what should really inspire you
And keep you going to do what you wanna do.
Think a lot of people look to people in show business
Or anybody who's famous
To model their lifestyle on.
One of my role models was Keith and every once in a while
I'd see him...
We'd exchange goodies.
But I always looked up to him for the way of life that he
Lived, and it was a way of life for him, it still is.
And sometimes, they're your friends and...
You have to stop being their friend
When they don't listen because
It's like somebody drowning.
They'll drag you down with them, it's just not worth it.
So... if you're modeling your lifestyle on somebody
And it turns out that they died on smack,
That's not very clever, see.
I don't think there's anything admirable
About being a dead legend,
And that's probably the reason why I'm not into it.
It was killing me, and I felt that I was probably
Much more effective alive than dead.
I wouldn't put that to a vote.
Go check out Jim Morrison and Jimmy Hendrix
And Janice Joplin, that's not my idea of fun.
Because it's a lot of hours of throwing up blood and stuff
Like that and if you're gonna do that on stage, it's great
But it's not that much fun in a Holiday Inn, you know.
I have a prescription for a happy life which is,
Sex, drums and rock 'n' roll.
[ROCK SONG PLAYING]
BILL: We kinda let that go, but the rules of my contest is
That's a little bit too skimpy because
We're looking for a
Gazzarri dancer, not kind of a
Risqué stuff like that.
There will be no bikinis, or G-strings or stuff like that,
They have to wear foxy rock 'n' roll clothes.
[BOOING]
Boo?
Boo?
Boo?
Okay...
I'll tell you what?
Why don't you guys run a contest?
- [CROWD CHEERING]
- Okay?
You mean, you want a strip contest instead?
- MAN: Fuck you, man.
- Okay.
GIRL: They're just looked at as sex objects.
'Cause afterwards, the guys make fun of them anyway.
You can hear 'em talkin' about it, making fun of them.
She starts taking all her shit off, right
And all of a sudden,
I notice while she's dancing,
That she doesn't have any fucking underwear on
And we're sitting there going,
"Fuck, we have muff, we have muff!'"
[CROWD CHEERING]
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
You know what, he ended up that night with the...
Fifth runner up.
We did all right.
WOMAN: So, Bill,
You walk around the club all the time with these
18 year old girls and people ask you "How you do it, right?"
What do you say?
I liked 18 year old girls, when I was 18!
I love 'em now!
Why should I stop?
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
They say "You're not like a
60-year old guy",
"You're like three 20 year old guys, with all the energy you have".
Rock 'n' roll forever!
WOMAN: That's a cut.
So what's the biggest audience you ever played for?
Well, that would be in probably in Hungary.
- How many people?
146,000 people.
158,000 people in São Paulo, Brazil.
- Which is still a record.
- You beat KISS?
- Well, we always try.
- Yeah.
You're looking at 83,000 people thinking,
"Man, I gotta entertain these people"
You know what I'm saying,
83,000 shoes times two makes...
What is that?
A state. It wasn't police there, there was the army,
The whole army, was like the security.
And the great thing about it was that it was in Brazil
And the nice thing about that is you really realize rock 'n' roll
Is the thing that holds the world together.
'Cause music is the common language.
Oh, the first time you break through to an audience
And they all go nuts, that's better than screwing,
You know that's better, that's the best.
Better than sex,
Better than anything in the world you could ever do.
It's like this...
I love it. It's great.
- It's like beating off?
- It's worse than that.
WOMAN: What do you think about kids that wanna try to make it?
Sure, I did, why not?
Go for it.
If you think you've got it!
Shove it out. Run it up the flag pole and see who salutes it.
The only people that are ever gonna tell you
You can't accomplish something are the ones who fail.
I'm not here to tell you, you can't do something
'Cause I did it.
You can do it.
TYLER: I wanted it so bad.
You know that's one thing looking back, I know that...
If you want something that bad,
And you think positive about it,
And... to the point where you become it,
Therefore you are it.
You gotta believe that you're going to make it,
And if you don't, at least you gave 100% trying to make it.
Anybody that sits on top of his palace, after you've worked
All your life to get it and says
"It's lonely at the top, it's just miserable, it's just..."
They're full of it.
It's the best.
But at the same time, we're not such thin people, that you know
I mean we dry up and blow away, you know
Start injecting drugs, because, you know,
We didn't get a hit single or something.
I'd rather be happy.
I would rather be broke and happy, than rich and sad.
WOMAN: What do you have to say to kids
Who wanna make it as a rock star?
Don't!
What I wanna be when I grow up?
I would say...
I would say happy.
Did you ever think that I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think,
Stop thinking you're the only one I'm thinking of?
You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too.
Things will be better when I'm dead and gone.
WOMAN: Do you ever feel that way about your parents?
I've had a pretty good relationship with my folks.
- I don't know.
- Are they proud...
A lot of people have a bad relationship with their parents,
That's why they end up being disappointed with life.
They take it out on themselves, a lot of parents
Are real dickheads. They treat their kids real miserably.
You know, and that's why we grow up like this.
I'm in this business for the reason that
Megadeth is in this business and that's because of attitude,
Integrity and music.
WOMAN: Do you want to live a lifestyle of a...
- of a rock star?
- Nah!
That's megalomania to me,
I don't wanna get used to something that'll run out,
I'd rather stay myself all the way, and not ever
Get used to, you know, having a huge lifestyle
So that in case anything happens like I lose an arm or something,
Then you know, I have to get used to being a bum again.
We don't want to sit here and talk about all kinds of
Perverted sexual games we do on tour,
We don't want to sit here and talk about drugs,
We don't talk about a lot of same old rehash stuff that bands
Keep doing over and over again in this business...
Yeah, I wanna stay on a street level because then I don't have
Any pretentious values in life.
I don't start writing music just for the dollar sign.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
We're on the road so much
That you have to freaking keep your wits about you.
This music is technical music, it is
Harder to play than most of the other rock bands out there and,
I think that you need to keep your chops in shape,
You need to keep your health in shape.
And I'm not gonna cheat the audience that way,
I don't get high when I'm practicing at home alone,
So why should I do it when I go up on stage?
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
A band should go up on stage
And play for themselves, not having to put make-up on
And stuff like that.
I mean, it's like a wall of
Marshalls and your band playing,
That's a show for me.
[PLAYING IN MY DARKEST HOUR]
In my hour of need,
Ha, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
DAVE: Well we get categori zed
Into a lot of different metal monikers...
WOMAN: What so far?
Megadeth, that's the best way to explain us
Because we don't really like to be labeled anything,
I think categorization is a sin because it cuts you off
It doesn't let you go any far, you can't expand,
Some of the satanic bands, they can't write anything about
Politics or love or anything like that or no love or whatever
Because they're dealing strictly with Satan.
WOMAN: So, Dave, how come you write about death so much?
Not only death, it's more about awareness you know
Because without death life would be
Meaningless, don't you think?
Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes
I mean life, death, sex,
- pretty happening to me.
- Yeah.
- What else is there?
- Beer, maybe.
Beer!
[WOMAN LAUGHS]
I walk, I walk alone
Into the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please, God, send me on my way
Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only
Felt by fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you
Alone so alone I'm lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain,
Won't you hold me again?
And you just laughed, ha ha, bitch
My whole life is work
Built on the past
But the time has come
When all things shall pass
This good thing passed away
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
DAVE: When it starts going to your head
And you start thinking that you're God, it's stupid!
Because in my book, there's always somebody better.
It's like David Lee Roth said,
You're here today, gone later today
WOMAN: You guys get signed yet?
It's getting close, very close.
Everybody in rock 'n' roll, heavy rock,
Is supposed to be stupid, and we're not stupid.
Rock 'n' roll should corrupt kids enough to think.
There's nothing wrong with thinking.
They will not stop rock 'n' roll.
This is what it is.
To be a rock 'n' roll star
Is the greatest thing in the world
Popes don't get laid and I do.
Just be real careful, wear a rubber,
And don't do drugs, what can I say?
Just remember one thing,
You meet lot of people on the way up,
Don't fuck them 'cause you meet them on the way down as well.
I love you.
[UNDER MY WHEELS BY
ALICE COOPER PLAYING]
The telephone is ringing
You got me on the run
I'm driving in my car now
Anticipating fun
I'm driving right up to you, babe

You've got me on the run
I'm driving in my car now

Telephone is ringing
You got me on the run
I'm driving in my car now
Anticipating fun
I'm driving right up to you, babe
I guess that you couldn't see, yeah, yeah, yeah
But you were under my wheels, honey

You got me on the run
Because I want to
Our first runner up,
Lisa
Mareno.
Lisa Mareno.
Where is Lisa?
MAN: She's gone!
She's gone?
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
You're kidding!
Arnold, you know, god wants to get close to you.
Look, let god into your life.
Don't... this work is not gonna help you.
This is... this is the work of the devil.
Oh, Candace, why are you doing this kind of work?
You could do so much.
You could help people so much more because you're a nice lady.
God wants you too... especially wants you, Candace, to be close to him.
Can't you do some other kind of work?
This is not right.
You have grandchildren.
Don't you know how precious they are?
These little babies are precious.
Life is precious.
Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen.
- Holy Mary...
- man: Ain't the dogs come out?
I'd like to offer this to you, miss.
- We can help you.
- Man: We got a place next door.
- Y'all can? Then give me some money.
- Maybe we can help you out.
We'll help you out right next door.
That's what they do.
Mary: Oh, mothers... please, dear mothers.
Mothers... you're a mother of a baby right now.
Don't have this abortion.
Choose life.
Woman: You need to know the facts about abortion.
God made you pregnant.
It's not a mistake.
We're here to help you.
There is so much help available.
Even right across the street there's help.
Come on, please. Wait...
Think about yourself.
95% of women will tell you they regret their abortion.
You're not gonna be different.
This just makes everything worse.
Trust me.
Oh, where's my baby?
Around this time he goes for the... killer...
That's what an abortionist is...
And he'll zoom out of here in his white...
In his yellow... what's that?
A car, mustang, or whatever it's called.
I don't know cars.
But that's what he does.
Then he'll come back a half an hour later with the...
Ahem, quotation marks...
"doctor" under a sheet.
I don't know what they tell the people inside what we do.
- See, there he goes.
Here he goes.
See, and I'll stand...
I'll stand in front of the car
'cause I know his sched...
Oh, hi there, miss. Hi.
You know, you haven't got much time for the baby to live.
But... I know, it's not your... but it's...
This is your baby... this...
No, but you're here to help this woman have an abortion.
Hello, Arnold. Hi.
Hello, Arnold.
See this? Huh? Huh?
See these little babies here?
Look at this...
This was your granddaughter.
That's your granddaughter that you love so much.
This is your granddaughter.
That's how she was.
And these are the size of these babies here.
Why do you do this kind of work, Arnold, huh?
That's choice for you, right?
That's choice.
Okay, it shows positive.
Okay?
It shows you at about 10 weeks, okay?
Which is about this size here.
Okay? You can hold it.
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
Um, are you surprised?
It's okay.
It's okay to be nervous, all right?
Just wanna let you know that.
So we would like to offer you an ultrasound, okay?
Is that something that you think your mom would like to be here for?
Are you close with your mom?
- Not really.
- Not really? Okay.
Do you wanna have your sister come in?
- Her test has shown positive.
- Ugh!
Widline...
Woman: You can put her at 11:30.
Anne: She just got out of school.
She's 15. She's in school.
She's not communicating at all.
Just turns her head.
I wanna go inside.
I just wanna get it done with.
Brittney?
Well, actually I'll just see brittney first, okay?
- Man: Okay.
- All right. You can have a seat.
When you say one pregnancy, are you counting this as a pregnancy or you had a previous pregnancy?
- I had one before.
- You had one before?
- It ended in abortion or it ended in miscarriage or... - an abortion.
So you're considering abortion as your number-one option?
Yeah, I don't feel ready for... for the baby.
I don't have insurance.
I don't have a job, you know.
What motivated the abortion decision the first time?
- Um, I think... - just the same... just uncertainty or...
No, I... in the beginning
I wanted to keep it, but my mom didn't want me to because she said that it was gonna ruin my life and stuff.
So I just... I don't know.
I didn't want my mom to be mad at me and...
I don't know.
Do you think she would react the same now?
I think she'd be more mad.
- Yeah?
- Now, yeah.
- I think she'd be really upset.
- Yeah.
- I don't really wanna tell her.
- Right.
Well, you know, at this point there's not really a whole...
There's not reason, really, to rush off to tell her.
Looks like you'd be at about seven weeks.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Seven weeks is about this size here...
The littlest one.
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. Okay?
- The growth is pretty quickly.
- Yeah.
Yeah, they grow pretty quickly.
It's kind of an amazing thing.
- And that's how big it is?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
That's how big he is at seven weeks.
You can take him out.
We can get you in to have an ultrasound and just...
You know, so you know we do offer free ultrasound, because it's a visual, you know?
It shows you what's happening inside there.
Got him.
- Woman: There's the baby right there.
- Mm-hmm.
If you look real close, you can see his little heart beating.
Right there.
If you look real close, it's flickering.
- It's quiet, but you can hear it.
- Mm-hmm.
Anne: You can see it too.
- Woman: There, you see?
- Oh, yeah.
Man: Oh my gosh.
It's pretty tiny, but definitely there with the heartbeat.
- That's crazy.
- Right?
Um...
Anne: And the baby doubles in size every week, so next week it'll be twice that.
- Man: Wow.
- In the beginning they grow at an amazing rate.
Yeah, like you can see...
This is seven weeks and this is eight weeks.
You know?
So they do grow pretty quickly.
Man: Oh, yeah.
Wow.
You want me to drive?
Hmm?
- Huh?
- I'll drive.
I'll drive.
Gosh... "Hi, mommy and daddy."
- That's tough.
- I know.
Tony: You're not defending it.
You're letting it be murdered.
It's the same thing as have somebody kidnap your son and beat him to death.
The difference is your son can speak up.
This child cannot speak.
So someone has to stand up for it.
You're not.
And you can ignore me all you want.
You can ignore me all you want.
You're gonna stand before god and before Jesus...
Have to give account of this.
What are you gonna say?
"Oh, I didn't want it"?
"I couldn't afford it"?
Wrong answer.
- I have one for your record books.
- Huh?
For your memories of freaky things that happen in the United States.
It's this breaking news on the operation rescue website.
Philadelphia women's center on Tuesday had free abortions in honor of George tiller.
- That's not a joke?
- This is totally not a joke.
Yes, and they're proud of it.
They did it in honor of tiller, late-term abortionist.
- That's crazy.
- Yeah. Sick.
- Well, here they come.
- Yeah.
They came down the other way of the street.
Anne: You wonder what's the, like, keyword.
You know, "we're in" or
"cover down" or... you know.
Man: Come on out.
Oh my gosh, could you imagine if it came out like an albino?
- Oh.
- Don't worry.
Girl: No, like, white hair and red eyes.
Oh my god.
No, it really is.
I know an albino person.
This is Satan's baby.
Ew.
You can get breast cancer from an abortion?
Girl #2: I don't know, man.
Girl: That's, like, not cool though.
It's scary.
Hello, brittney?
Hi, this is Anne calling from the pregnancy care center.
How are you? Good good.
I was... I was hoping that I'd be able to reach you today.
You doing okay?
Yeah?
How...
You're what?
Did you... did you make any progress towards making a decision or...
How are you? Yeah?
And?
Yeah.
Did you go through with it already?
Yeah?
Well...
Yeah. Okay.
She aborted.
She aborted.
That was very quick.
They must have aborted on Saturday.
I'm sure they did it across the street.
I'm sure.
I think that even though it's hard and, you know,
I go through things like this, my situation makes me the perfect person to do a job like this.
I'm an unmarried person with very few responsibilities in terms of other things that I have to tend to.
It's basically my two dogs and myself that I have charge of, you know.
And...
I think I'm at a point where I do really understand that this battle is just so vicious and that the evil is...
So powerful and so brutal that I really think god's doing everything he can.
It will end. I know that.
I just don't think it's gonna be pretty.
Anne: The abortion clinic in fort Pierce is run by a wife and a husband.
They're doing it because that's their paycheck.
It's like walking into a car dealership...
They want to sell you a car.
And walking into an abortion clinic...
They want to sell you an abortion.
You're not going to get the truth.
You're not gonna get neutrality.
You're gonna get a sales pitch.
Clearly our competition is the abortion clinic.
We are actually on opposite sides of the street.
You know, abortion clinic, pregnancy care center.
You know, darkness and light.
You know, death and life.
I mean, it doesn't get more distinct than that.
We have two women who call...
She's fearless or she's fearful.
That's it.
If she's fearless, she's not even saying hello.
She's, "hey, how much do you charge for abortion?"
I need to make an appointment for an abortion."
She's often times rushed.
If you don't hook her right away, she hangs up on you.
When she calls and she says,
"do you do abortions?"
I say,
"are you calling for yourself or are you calling for your friend?"
She says, "I'm calling for myself."
I say, "well, when did you have a pregnancy test?"
And we engage in conversation.
Because if she calls and says,
"do you do abortions?"
And I say no... click.
They're not always sure who they're calling anyway.
They don't know if they're calling us or the abortion clinic.
But again, I'm not trying to talk her out of it.
I'm trying to get her in the door.
Take control of the conversation.
There's a lot at stake here.
I don't mind the criticisms of "taking control" doesn't... that doesn't sound fair.
That doesn't sound...
Well, then too bad.
You walk her to the room, you sit her down, you close the door, you excuse yourself and you come back.
It's okay that they're sit in the room by themselves, because inevitably what do they do when they're in there by themselves?
They read.
And since we're the ones putting out what is read in the room, we know it's good information.
And there's no deceit in this, okay?
There's no deceit. Trust me.
And whenever I have any doubt about any direction,
I ask father Tom.
Look at this morally.
You know, look at this from an ethical point of view.
Is this okay to say?
Is this okay to do?
And he examines it.
And trust me, if it weren't okay, he wouldn't allow me to do it.
Here, Arnold, see the baby? See?
See the little baby, huh?
Doctor, you don't have to do this kind of work.
These are what you kill.
Huh? Look.
Are those... scumbag.
Father Tom euteneuer:
When we dedicate ourselves heart and soul to pro-life, we are doing something prophetic.
My friends, as we go on in our society in the future,
I predict that it's going to get a lot more difficult to be pro-life.
The forces on the other side are solidifying their power...
Their political power, their social power...
And they're becoming more militant against us...
Because the abortion industry is more and more looking like a diabolical religion.
Think about it.
In the United States, most of the abortions are done in these free-standing abortion clinics.
They're like temples because inside that clinic you have an altar, which is the abortion table.
On that altar they offer up a blood sacrifice.
It's ritualized blood sacrifice.
There's got to be demons involved in that.
There are policemen who protect it.
They're kind of like their guardian angels.
They have their hierarchy called planned parenthood.
They have their dogma called choice, and they enforce that dogma.
For them it's an infallible dogma.
So my friends, we're talking about something deeply diabolical at the core of our country because the forces that we are fighting are not flesh and blood, but they are the powers of darkness.
Anne: Arnold does all the pick-up of the abortionists and they use a bright yellow mustang.
This is supposed to be not drawing attention to the whole abortionists coming in to the abortion, though?
And you can hear the car...
Voom... start up.
In fact, in my office
I can hear it.
They painted their building gaudy orange.
They... we don't know what their tactic was on that, but it might have been a way for them to be able to say to their own clients, you know, "come to the bright orange building as opposed to that other one," because they thought they might have been getting too many...
Losing too many clients to this place.
It hasn't really impacted...
I mean, we still get women coming in here thinking they're going there.
So we... we attract them.
Now if they move somewhere else, yeah, we'd have to think about that because I think there's an important value in being as close as you can.
They did move from port Saint Louis up here.
And I was at both places.
Now I remember the time when they had the fence up in front of the place.
They put the fence up because we were talking to women, you know, and we were effective in taking them away.
But the fence went up and so we decided that...
Or I decided that I would talk to women over the fence by bringing a ladder and getting on top of the ladder and talking to them over the fence.
And so of course that generated a 911 call because I was now talking down to women.
Oh my...
Cop.
I don't know.
It's gonna be a hard one.
Very hard.
Anne: She's totally abortion-minded.
It's just like abortion logic, you know?
She has two other kids, da-da da-da.
I got to scan her today.
I don't wanna lose her.
If I make her come back, she might not.
Do you remember the one day
I was in the client...
In the counseling room with...
Like, six hours with that girl and jan was like, "so like now their new strategy is lock 'em in" till they decide to keep the baby?"
It's just like her.
Okay, Victoria, it does show positive, okay?
The nurse can scan you today.
- It wouldn't be right away.
- Okay.
I know you said you were hungry, okay?
I'm actually hungry too.
No no no, I'm gonna treat you.
Yeah. Just tell me.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Lunch is here.
Okay, um, let's see.
Ahem, how old is he?
- The same age.
- The same age?
Well, he's 23. I'm 24.
But he's not the best boyfriend, huh?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
He is verbally abusive and...
He's verbally abusive?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
For all you know, the baby changes him.
I have no idea. I don't know.
But you know, I mean, you're putting yourself through a surgery, through an emotional trauma in order to not be more tied to him or not to extend your relationship with him.
I mean, as a mom of two already,
I have to do what's best for me and my kids.
I've seen it so many times over that you think you're suffering's not gonna be too much.
I'm still waiting for a woman to sit where you're sitting and tell me,
"I'm not suffering from my abortion."
I'm not regretful.
I'm not depressed.
"I'm glad I did it."
I know for a fact that I won't regret it.
I don't know for a fact that I won't be depressed.
Maybe I will.
I don't know for a fact that...
That I won't stress about it.
Looking at the pictures stress me out.
I'm... I'm like, you know, all like...
You know, that's... that's bad.
It kind of...
You know, it hurts me.
But that's what abortions are for.
Abortions are to terminate unwanted pregnancies.
This pregnancy is unwanted.
I will have no regrets at all.
The only regrets that I have is sleeping with him...
Sleeping with him without a condom that one time.
You know, that's all it takes is one time.
- That's what I regret.
- That's all it takes is one time, but condoms...
- That's what I regret.
- Reality check here...
Condoms are only effective
85% of the time, okay?
- So even using a condom...
- Yeah.
Doesn't save you.
- Yeah, but 99.9%...
- No, 85%.
- Condoms are 85%?
- Are 85% effectiveness.
Okay, well, all the times
I used condoms,
I never got pregnant.
The times that
I haven't used condoms, that's when I get pregnant.
That's what I'm gonna base this off.
If I'd used a condom,
I wouldn't be pregnant.
- I'm gonna step outside and make a phone call.
- Oh, sure. Go ahead.
It'll just be a couple of minutes
- on the ultrasound anyway.
- Okay.
Man, this bitch is getting on my fucking nerve.
You know, if I have this baby, she's not gonna take care of it.
She's not gonna get up in the middle of the night, make a bottle for me.
She's not gonna be there.
Well, the thing is,
I don't... I don't care.
Like, don't try to talk me out of nothing.
I told her my mind is made up.
And in a few minutes I'm fixin' to get the ultrasound so I can get the hell up outta here.
- She's ready.
- Okay.
- Was the parking lot full when you came in?
- Yeah.
Or in the front wasn't...
In the front.
- Oh, I didn't know about the front.
- Oh, okay.
I was getting ready to go here, but I didn't see any...
Some days are, uh, busier than... than others.
- Is that it?
- Woman: Um...
There appears to be something there, but I can't confirm it yet.
Victoria: I'm sure she probably does that a lot because of the way she did it to me.
I mean, she offered to buy me food.
I found that crazy because, you know, I reached in my pocketbook.
I had my own money.
Maybe she thought because she bought me some McDonald's that was gonna change my mind, but...
They're some, like, anti-abortion...
I see a baby doll right there.
I don't know.
I feel like it's kind of crazy for them to just sit out of an abortion clinic.
I mean, the baby has nothing to do with them.
I don't know.
When your mind is made up, though, it can't be stopped.
- Woman: Are you the one with the sign?
- Yeah.
I just have a few questions about it.
- Why are you parked in there?
- Why am I parking there?
- This is an abortion clinic.
- I understand what it is.
- Okay.
- I had to park somewhere to talk to you.
- So park over there.
- Well, I'm already parked.
- Okay.
- That's not what I'm worried about.
I just would... I wanna understand why you guys use signs pointing to this building saying...
- Because they perform abortions here.
- "Baby killers"?
Okay...
Number one, the Bible says not to judge.
What is that doing?
- The Bible also...
- Pointing the finger.
- There's a difference. You're misinterpreting it.
- No no no.
- Yeah, you are.
- How about the sign you guys hold out here
- in front of the school for these little children...
- Right.
With a baby torn apart?
Why are you shooting the messenger?
They're the ones performing abortions, not us.
- I'm not shooting the messenger.
- Yeah, you are.
I'm just trying to let you guys know...
- This place was here first.
- That this is not helping.
I just have to pass this every day
- and it just disgusts me because...
- it disgusts you?
How do you think god feels about it?
So how do you think god feels about it?
He's creating these children...
- when you're holding up signs...
- Please let me finish.
- God creates us in the womb, yes?
- Yes, he does.
They're being destroyed here.
They're being murdered.
Right, I understand that completely.
That takes "precedent" over everything.
- If you do not value life, then what do you value?
- Okay.
That takes precedence over everything.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.
Woman: Keep pointing the finger.
Go ahead.
Woman #2: We're not pointing fingers.
We wanna close this place down.
Tony, she's just giving her opinion.
Unfortunately, she's been manipulated by the enemy because if she knew better, she would not be parked there...
- no, she's being an overprotective mom.
- She's being a f...
Her son or daughter goes to this school.
You know?
Tony: When the owner of the abortion clinic goes to pick up the abortionist, he's covered with a sheet so that we cannot see who this person is.
His identity is hidden from us so we don't harm him.
Now what has come to light to me within the past month is I've discovered, thanks through god, that I know where the owner of the abortion clinic meets the abortionists.
I know where he picks them up and where he drops them off.
Right now what I wanna do is I wanna check the super Wal-Mart and see if one of the doctors is parked there...
If it's the doctor
I'd seen the last time, if that's his vehicle.
That's him.
It is the same guy. Okay.
'Cause I've watched him and this is the same plate.
That's him.
Little do they know little old me is following them.
This is the part of doing this that drive you crazy.
You just have to wait.
I've been talking to a few people, a very small circle of people, about this information and hoping that they have contacts with people that can take this information and... bring it to light, tell me who the names are, where they live, et cetera, et cetera.
And then...
And then I was thinking of doing... is making a fairly big billboard, probably like 4x4, with a picture of the abortionist and say "this doctor performs abortions."
I'm not worried about the risks.
I'm not worried about any of that.
I'm not concerned about that because this is worth it.
This is life and death we're dealing with here and these people just don't see it that way.
Somebody came up with the idea that it's a woman's right.
It's her body.
She can do what she wants.
Well, unfortunately, that is not true.
Ho-ho, yes!
He came in a different direction.
He just... the owner of the abortion clinic dropped him off.
Opens up the car, goes in.
It's as if nothing happened.
He's just living his life, walking through it...
La-di-da-da, as if nothing happened.
He's just going about his everyday life.
Has no effect on him.
He could be going home to spend the day with his family and that just totally sickens me to death.
He just performed abortions and then he's going home and being affectionate to his wife or his...
And his children.
That just tears me up.
Candace: We had a chiropractor across the street and he put his building up for sale.
The sign went up one day, it literally came down the next day... within 24 hours.
And it was them.
They are relentless.
They just...
They never stop.
I mean, they don't have a life.
Evidently, they don't have a life.
I mean, every once in a while we think about, oh, we can go do a protest on their corner of the street, but we don't have time.
We're too busy raising grandkids and kids and working and making a living and living our lives.
We're not obsessed with them, you know?
If they would just stay on their side of the street and do what they've got to do...
And whatever they do over there, I just...
Oh, and I think one of them just showed up.
Lots of times they leave signs that they bring with them.
And there's a... that one big bloody fetus sign that shows the head, the arms, the legs.
They say it's eight weeks and...
Which is a bunch of junk.
They left it out there by the telephone pole or the pole out there, and we grabbed it and brought it in.
We take them home and destroy them.
All right, first things first here.
Let's see, 46 years old.
I'm still older than you.
"Do you have any doubts about your decision today to terminate your pregnancy?"
"Very very small ones."
Explain that to me.
What kind of doubts are you having?
It's okay.
Just I have no children.
And, um, in my 30s
I got rheumatoid and they told me not to get pregnant.
Then I got divorced and I'm with a great guy, but only four months.
But I'm 46, and if I have this baby, I'll be 47.
When that baby's 20, I'll be 67.
Those are the reasons
I'm doing this...
- Simply age.
- Age?
I don't know if I'll be physically able in my 50s to handle a toddler.
I wanna do it now before the child gets older in my womb.
Okay. Okay.
Well, as long as you're okay with everything, everything else will be okay.
We just wanna make sure that...
That this is definitely what you need to do, not want to do.
Nobody ever wants to do this, okay?
Nobody ever wants to do this.
But if it's what you need to do...
And it's your decision only.
- Nobody's forcing you to do this?
- No.
I take the responsibility to heart.
I can see you're a very serious person.
Okay.
Woman: Call upon your god.
Call upon your god.
Woman: Arnold, this is somebody's grandchildren here.
Somebody's grandchildren.
I would be ashamed too if I were you.
I would be ashamed.
I pick up the doctors because I do protect them.
The sheet is to cover them up so they won't know who they are, so they won't recognize them.
And then they go to their houses and they protest over there.
So we don't want them to do that.
I do worry about Candace.
When she's out there by herself, you know,
I tell her all the time to come back home before it gets dark.
"Shot in the back three times at close range" as he arrived to perform abortions.
"Police say Griffin has admitted the slaying."
Hmm.
"Second doctor's death closes clinic."
Yeah, they got a replacement and that doctor was killed too.
Thank god none of my doctors got killed.
Thank god.
The physicians that I know are very cautious about where they park their cars, who...
They have guns.
They carry weapons.
They wear bulletproof vests.
You try to protect them, but there's only so much you can do.
There's only so much you can do.
And then if they quit or get killed, where's the next doctor coming from?
He did move that camera closer to the building.
That's the alley, so we can see them when they're trying to get on our property, get too close to the building.
October 8th of 2000...
We had a fire that started in this room that was undetermined, but they thought the fax machine kind of started it.
But they pulled the plug out from the wall and there was nothing wrong with the plug.
So it didn't start with the fax machine.
I suspect foul play, that someone...
It was arson.
I do.
But I'm not a fire marshal.
I'm not an expert on fire or arson or anything.
I know nothing about it.
But I just know that was an awful year and we were closed for six months and it...
We almost lost everything.
No, it looks pretty quiet.
Did you hear about yesterday?
Yeah. So that's why
I do think they are killing.
I just don't know when.
Man: All right, ladies.
The abortionist is here.
You still have time.
It's not too late.
You still have time not to go through this procedure that you're gonna regret for the rest of your life.
Man: Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen.
Man: When I say love, you say babies.
- Love.
- Crowd: Babies.
- Love.
- Crowd: Babies.
- Love.
- Crowd: Babies.
Unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
O clement, o loving, o sweet virgin Mary.
♪ Hey hey, you you, we don't like abortion ♪
♪ No way, no way, got to save the babies. ♪
For the past 14 years, we pro-lifers have had it easy.
That's all changed.
Elections do have consequences.
Man: What god has promised to all... the right to life...
No man, including president Barack
Obama, can take away.
- Get ready to say yes to life.
- Crowd: Yes!
We may have lost an election, we have not lost the war.
Man #2: You cannot outlast us and we will defeat you!
Anne: It's a right to free speech.
I mean, I just got back from Washington where there was a block full of these signs in front of the white house.
It would strike me as very curious, you know, that there would be a city of fort Pierce ordinance that can overrule the constitution.
Yeah.
There is a thing that says
"obscene pictures."
- I don't see anything obscene, so I'm not worried about it.
- Okay.
The major point here is we need to make sure you stay off of their property.
Oh yeah, nobody's interested in that.
Nobody has any interest in being on their property.
- You're staying or you're going?
- I'm staying.
Okay.
Do you recognize anybody out there?
The only one
I recognize is Cheryl, the one with the life mobile Van.
- Oh, that.
- She's across the street though, talking to somebody.
I'm surprised James ain't out there.
But I don't recognize all the older people.
- There's someone out there with a Walker.
- A Walker?
She's sitting on it.
That's ridiculous.
Candace: Started this a long time ago...
All the little brochures that they hand out on the sidewalk that we have kept or...
Just collected over the years.
"Complications of abortion."
Possible immediate complications:
Excessive bleeding, possibly causing removal of the uterus
"and a resulting inability to have children."
Oh, what language.
Breast cancer.
There's been so many studies done on the breast cancer thing and they all deny that.
And one... and one of the physicians that I've worked with for many many years says that if that's true, everybody who has a miscarriage would get breast cancer, and that's just not true.
I... I don't know where they get their medical information from, but I know that's totally wrong.
I've had patients who have booked an appointment.
I've given them directions on how to get here and they get confused because on the other side of Delaware and south 12th street is that pregnancy care center...
That sounds so nice.
The patients get confused and go to the wrong building.
It's like two hours later and the girl will ask,
"well, when am I getting my abortion?"
"Oh, we don't do abortions here."
That's when the patient figures out that she's in the wrong place.
- Stop.
- Why?
♪ Nervous nervous nervous ♪
♪ Nervous nervous nervous ♪
- ♪ Nervous nervous nervous. ♪
- Shut up.
That's your name for the day...
Nervous, miss nervous.
What do you think is the motivating factor for...
- Me to get this?
- Yeah.
My future and...
I can't take care of a baby right now.
I'm only in 11th grade.
I'm 17. I turn 18 in December.
I can't take on the responsibility of a baby by myself.
I just can't do it right now.
Do you really know what you choose when you choose abortion?
You will be given an anesthetic...
Two needles... into the cervix.
The doctor would use the force of the suction to essentially tear it apart... all the limbs.
The head would be crushed and the doctor would be using it to pull out the baby basically piece by piece.
And then it winds up, in the end, in a little jar.
You can't just walk around with, you know, pieces of the decaying fetus inside your body without developing an infection.
If a toe or a finger or a piece of the baby is left inside, then that produces a risk for you.
Narrator: In some cases, the patient will experience bleeding that is heavy enough to require a transfusion or hysterectomy.
In the most serious of these instances, she will die.
Can you cut it off?
I can't see it.
- Anne: You don't wanna see it?
- No.
Wanna go with the computer animated?
There's no blood. It's not real bodies.
It's computer.
- That was a real one?
- That's real.
- Kind of scary.
- Yeah.
I hate my life.
Yes yes!
Yes! Two in one day.
Ashante is keeping her baby.
We thought this one was Gonzo.
- Woman: Priggins?
- Priggins.
I couldn't freakin' believe it.
She got up to the point...
She made an appointment in Fort Lauderdale.
Never went. Never went!
Widline: I'm seven months pregnant now.
I didn't want no child at this age right now because people will look down at me and say I won't be nothing.
I tried everything in my powers to get rid of it, like drinking vinegar and, like, lifting heavy stuff up and moving heavy stuff around.
Anne told me about abortion.
A woman... she can, like, lose her life over abortion or don't have kids at all no more in the future.
So, um, I didn't wanna take that risk.
I don't think he's gonna, like...
It's gonna be harder with the baby.
I think I'm gonna get a lot of help.
I hope so.
Is this the abortion clinic?
Candace: Yes, it is, hon.
Come on in.
- Across the street?
- Yes.
And she made me watch this video of a surgical abortion.
It was very vivid and showed everything.
It was gruesome.
It was like watching a scary movie.
Just like...
There was so much blood and all these...
It was just disgusting.
There's not blood all over the surgery room, sweetie-pie.
I promise you.
Abortion is one of the safest procedures.
It is safer than having full-term delivery.
It's safer than having your tonsils out.
There's not blood all over the place.
I promise you.
You did an ultrasound already?
Yes, I took one across the street.
- And how far along did they say you were?
- I just went Wednesday.
They told me I was seven weeks, two days.
- This past Wednesday?
- Yeah.
- Seven weeks, two days?
- Yes. And two weeks before that, they told me I was five and a half weeks.
When was your last period... first day?
- August 13th.
- I think that would...
- Okay, August. And it's October, right?
- Yes.
That would make you, according to this,
10 weeks and one day.
Between 10 and 11.
Well, we'll find out, okay?
See, because...
No way.
On a chart that I have, 3.5...
That would be considered 10 weeks.
- 10 weeks?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, they told me I was seven weeks, two days.
Okay, so you're only gonna pay $400 total.
I'm gonna take $50 off to have it done.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Good? Yeah?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Okay, baby. Okay.
- Okay.
I'll see you next Friday at 9:30, honey.
Okay? All right.
Man: No, these are not my words.
These are the words of...
Candace:
The pregnancy care center that's across the street from us...
They told her she was seven weeks.
They lie to patients about how many weeks they are so they think they have plenty of time to think about it a little bit longer.
I don't even think it's to get them to change their mind.
I think it's to have them be too far so they can't get it done.
That's what I think.
Or have to go to another state, another county, because clinics usually go up to, like, 12, 14 weeks, and that's it.
I... I don't get them people.
I just don't get them people.
It makes me wanna...
Makes me wanna cry.
Don't even...
I don't even know why, but I do...
I wanna cry today, because that's...
I just wanna go over there and shake them people and be all like,
"what the fuck are you doing?"
Why are you messing up these girls' lives?
"Why are you playing around with them like that?"
Oh.
Anne: Ooh.
No.
Arnold.
Arnold.
Arnold, brother, let's speak.
Come talk to me.
I haven't talked to you for a while.
Let's talk.
Euteneuer: Of the father, of the son and of the holy spirit, amen.
We offer this rosary for all of our regular pro-life intentions, especially the end to the evil of abortion, the conversion of all abortionists, to the conversion of those who come to this place, those who work at this place, those who support this work.
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
- Amen.
- Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
- Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now...
And at the hour of our death, amen.
- Holy Mary...
- Pray for us.
- Holy mother of god...
- Pray for us.
- Holy virgin of virgins...
- Pray for us.
- Mother of Christ...
- Pray for us.
- Mother of divine grace...
- Pray for us.
- Mother most pure...
- Pray for us.
- Mother most chaste...
- Pray for us.
- Mother inviolate...
- Pray for us.
- Mother undefiled...
- Pray for us.
- Mother most amiable...
- Pray for us.
- Mother most admirable...
- Pray for us.
- Mother of good counsel...
- Pray for us.
- Mother of our creator...
- Pray for us.
You know what? No more sex.
He can't have any unless he wears a condom.
- Are you married to him? He's your husband, right?
- Yeah.
You got to fight it.
That means take birth control pills,
- use condoms...
- But you know...
He's got to use condoms.
No, you're not stupid.
You just got to be more careful.
They don't care.
They're like...
They're like dogs.
They're like dogs.
- Yeah, I swear.
- Yeah.
How old are your babies?
You're not a mon...
You would be a monster if you...
If you had a baby and then mistreated it.
Oh...
Don't cry, sweetie-pie.
Don't cry.
Now are you like this because you're pregnant?
A lot of girls get kind of like this because they're pregnant.
They have hormones and it just goes zzz.
You never wanted to do this?
What's hurting you?
To have the abortion?
So why are you making yourself do this?
You are young.
You can have babies later on.
You really can. If you can't...
I don't want you to do this if you don't want to do it.
I mean, nobody ever wants to actually do it.
But, you know, if it's what you need to do to take care of you and the kids...
If you feel that way, why are you making yourself do it?
Mm-hmm.
Good afternoon.
A woman's world medical center.
How can I help you?
Tomorrow morning you'd have to be here at 6:30 in the morning, okay?
We do want you to bring your photo I.D. With you, a pair of socks, and we don't want you to eat anything after midnight tonight.
And when you get here in the morning, there may or may not be protesters outside.
If they are out there, just ignore them.
Come inside.
Yeah, if you needed to, we could send the lab tech out to walk up with you if you felt more comfortable.
Are you the father of this baby?
Don't give up your rights.
It's not a dead baby yet.
You come out, you're gonna be the mother of a dead baby and the whole family tree line is kaput.
Woman: These are the facts.
I know women that have had abortions and were never able to have a baby again.
And the only baby that they had is a dead one.
She is... she is thinking about it, but she wants help, money help.
I'll do it today. Whatever.
- Today.
- Whatever you need...
Whatever you need...
I will go to the bank today.
Whatever you need,
I'll help you.
Even if you have babies,
I'll give them clothes.
I'll give you money to help you with your rent, your gas, whatever you need, ma'am.
Whatever you need.
I'm not lying.
I tell you the truth.
Please.
I let you talk to the family.
Tell her I'll let her talk to the family.
Woman: Right now.
Hola. I'm Jim.
Everything's free.
Everything's free. Come on in.
Come on in with... okay.
Jim: Yeah, she did great, didn't she?
Oh my god.
Oh, thank you, lord.
Candace: If they really did change her mind, that's fine.
I just don't know who they think they are to try and control somebody they don't even know.
They talk that person into having another baby and they promise her everything in the world to get her to keep it, and then they don't deliver.
I've heard that story over and over again.
Jim: You think you're crying now?
I'm telling you, we see these women come in here, cry cry cry.
They can't stop because they think, "what did I do?"
What did I do?"
And you're a nice person.
We can tell.
You know, you would never hurt anybody.
You love children, right?
You have six children.
Okay?
I wanna give... come here,
I wanna give you a present.
Come here.
Let's pick out something nice for...
What kind of stuff do you think is cute?
What do you like?
Do you like little stuffed animals?
You wanna take a stuffed animal?
We got so many of these.
Which one do you want?
Pick out something you like.
Yeah, we'll hook you up.

YOU KNOW, I'M LEARNING SLOWLY
IN MY CRUISING CAREER...
THAT YOU CANNOT
EXPECT PEOPLE...
TO TRANSFORM
IN AN AFTERNOON.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
REWRITE THEIR SOULS...
AND REDO EVERY DAY
THAT THEY'VE LIVED THUS FAR...
BEFORE THEY COME ON
TO THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS,
AND YET I EXPECT THAT.
I EXPECT THE TOTAL
TRANSFORMATION OF THEIR LIFE,
THE ENTIRE REWRITE
OF THEIR SOULS.
I AM FIGHTING MINUTE TO MINUTE,
EVERY MOMENT
THAT THEY'RE ON THE BUS,
FOR EVERY DAY THEY'VE LIVED
THUS FAR TO SEEM AS...
A ABSTRACT WRECKAGE...
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED
BUT IS PROBABLY A DELUSION,
AND THAT THIS IS
THE FIRST REAL DAY OF THEIR LIVES.
NOT TO GENERALIZE.
AGAIN, WITH EVERY BUSLOAD,
THERE'S INTERNATIONALITY...
AND THEREFORE DIFFERENT
GRADATIONS...
OF CRUISING MANIFESTATION.
BUT I, UH--
I FIND MYSELF
CONNECTING...
WITH SOME OF THEM
MORE THAN OTHERS.
- IT IS RAINING?
- KIND OF.
- HELLO.
- HELLO.
WHAT'S UP, BENITEZ?
- WE'RE LEAVING.
- WE'RE LEAVING?
- OH, IT'S RAINING.
- NO!
IT'S NOT RAINING.
GREENWICH VILLAGE,

FEAR, A BASIC THEME
OF ALL OF OUR LIVES.
CONSTANTLY AFRAID ALONG THE
STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE,
UNDER THREAT
OF ASSASSINATION,
AND THE ASSASSINS
ARE OUR DREAMS TRIUMPHANT,
THE BY-PRODUCT OF SUCH A PURSUIT--
CREATIVITY AND RADICALIZATION--
WHICH ARE THE FURTHER THEMES

NEW YORK CITY
IS A LIVING ORGANISM.
IT EVOLVES, IT DEVOLVES.
IT FLUCTUATES AS A LIVING ORGANISM.
SO MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH NEW YORK CITY...
IS AS VITRIOLIC AS
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MYSELF...
AND WITH ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING,
WHICH MEANS THAT IT CHANGES
EVERY MILLISECOND,
THAT IT'S IN
CONSTANT FLUCTUATION.
THIS WINTER I REALLY FELT
LIKE WE WERE GETTING A DIVORCE.
AND I WAS CERTAINLY
THE LOSER OF THAT DIVORCE.
THERE WAS ANGER.
I WAS OVERWHELMED.
I WAS REEMERGED
INTO MY OWN NAIVETE.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW ANGRY
THE CITY WAS WITH ME.
IT SEEMED LIKE A VINDICTIVE WOMAN,
TO BE LIKE NO REASON WHATSOEVER,
JUST BY THE PURE RAGE
OF ITS OWN EXISTENCE.
BECAUSE THE CONCRETE SETTLED.
BECAUSE THE TERRA-COTTA
HAD BEEN METICULOUSLY CARVED.
BECAUSE SOME OF THE BUILDINGS
ARE HIGHER THAN OTHERS.
THE ANGER, THE INFERIORITY,
THAT SOME OF
THE SHORTER BUILDINGS FEEL, I FELT.
I SUDDENLY WAS NOT WELCOME
ON THIS ISLAND ANYMORE.
AND THE CITY AND I HAVE HAD...
A REEMERGENCE OF SOME KIND
IN THE SUMMER,
MAYBE BECAUSE I WAS ABLE
TO REFUEL MY CRUISE A LITTLE BIT...
BY WORKING LABORIOUSLY...
AND CRAWLING
MY WAY BACK ONTO THE ISLAND.
BECAUSE PERHAPS I PAID
PROPER RESPECT TO IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE CITY WAS SO
ANGRY WITH ME DURING THIS WINTER.
I'M JUST GLAD THAT IT'S NOT QUITE
AS ANGRY WITH ME RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK
TOO SOON, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
LIKE I SAID, THE RELATIONSHIP
SEEMS TO CHANGE,
AS ANY HUMAN
RELATIONSHIP WOULD...
AND WITH ANY LIVING THING.
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IF THIS
IS A LIVING ORGANISM,
IT'S MORE ON THE LINES OF A CYCLOPS.
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IF IT
IS A LIVING ORGANISM,
PERHAPS IT'S MORE ON THE
LEVEL OF A SCINTILLATING,
STREAMLINED MERMAID...
WHO SINGS TO ME AT NIGHT.
I GUESS I AM RIGHT NOW.
JOEL.
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO CHECK IN.
I DID THE 8:45 PICKUP.
HELLO. GRAY LINE.
YOU CAN STAY OUT THERE
ONE MINUTE.
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.
LET ME SEE IF MISS GALL
IS HERE. HOLD ON.
THE LOWER LOOP IN THE
DOWNTOWN DIRECTION...
NOW BOARDING THE BUS
OUTSIDE TO THE RIGHT.
WE NEED A TOUR GUIDE
FOR A SECOND SECTION DOWNTOWN.
HANG ON.
WAIT FOR THE SECOND SECTION.
I THINK OF EVERY
DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP...
AS ANOTHER LOOP
TOWARDS MY DEATH.
THAT IS WHY I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF THE DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP--
EACH LOOP AS A CONTINUOUS
AND INDIVIDUALIZED, UM,
SEARCH FOR PERFECTION.
H.G. WELLS ONCE WROTE...
THAT TO TELL THE HISTORY
OF NEW YORK CITY...
IS TO TELL THE STORY
OF THE WORLD.
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS.
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
PEOPLE WORK...
INSIDE THE WORLD TRADE
CENTER BUILDINGS...
DAILY.
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
BUILDINGS HAVE THEIR OWN ZIP CODE.
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
TOWERS THEMSELVES,
BUILT TO SWAY IN HEAVY WINDS
A FOOT AND A HALF IN ANY DIRECTION.
SOMETHING
TO CONSIDER.
SO WHAT'S UP, TIM?
HOW'S THE GRAY LINE?
- GRAY LINE IS LIKE--
- APPLE'S BETTER, RIGHT?
YEAH, DAMN RIGHT.
APPLE WAS LIKE A LIVING CARNIVAL.
WE WERE COSSACKS,
AND WE TOOK WHAT WE WANTED.
WE THREW PEOPLE OVERBOARD,
OFF THE BUS, IF WE DIDN'T LIKE THEM.
IT WAS OUR TERRITORY.
THE CITY BELONGED TO US
AT APPLE. -APPLE IS BETTER.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- NUMBER ONE.
I HAD MORE OF AN ERECTION
WHEN I WORKED AT APPLE.
I JUST FELT LIKE
SO MUCH MORE OF A MAN.
YOU KNOW APPLE
IS BETTER, RIGHT? -YEAH!
I WANTED TO HEAR YOU
SAY YES.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY YES.
FOR GOD'S SAKES.
- NUMBER ONE.
- I'M GONNA PROBABLY GET FIRED.
I'LL PROBABLY BE HUNG
FROM A FLAGPOLE SOMEWHERE,
BUT APPLE IS BETTER.
APPLE IS BETTER!
I THINK THAT THE GREAT
TOUR GUIDES OF APPLE TOURS,
IN THAT SENSE,
WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARTACUS.
SPARTACUS WAS ONE OF THE GREAT
TOUR GUIDES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.
HE WOULD HAVE FIT IN
AT APPLE TOURS.
BRUTUS AND HIS CONSPIRATORS...
RIGHT BEFORE THE
ASSASSINATION OF CAESAR,
THEY WERE APPLE TOUR GUIDES.
BUT LIKE WILLY WONKA
IS A GRAY LINE TOUR GUIDE.
ALSO ONE OF MY GREAT
INSPIRATIONS ON THE TOUR ROUTE,
BUT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THERE.
ATTILA THE HUN...
WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD
APPLE DISPATCHER.
WHEREAS VIRGIL
IN THE INFERNO,
I THINK WOULD HAVE WORKED
FOR GRAY LINE.
HOW MANY YEAR NOW? -LIKE FOUR
YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING THE TOUR.
NO, FIVE. DON'T SAY FOUR,
PLEASE. -FIVE YEARS.
YEAH! BY THE TIME
YOU WORKED AT GRAY LINE,
YOU GOT THAT TROLLEY BUS
AND YOU GO TO CENTRAL PARK.
- I REMEMBER THE DAMN TROLLEY.
- I WORKED ON THE DOUBLE-DECKER.
I REMEMBER THAT. -LATER ON
YOU COME WORK AT APPLE.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S BEEN
FIVE YEARS OF THIS, GOING IN CIRCLES.
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING
ON THIS SIDEWALK FOR FIVE YEARS.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
OH, LOOK, STRAIGHT UP.
THAT'S A GREAT VIEW.
THE WHITE TERRA-COTTA
STRAIGHT AHEAD.
THAT'S THE ONE BUILDING THAT LOUIS
SULLIVAN DESIGNED...
FOR NEW YORK CITY.
HMM.
LOOK AT THE METICULOUSNESS.
THAT STRONG VERTICAL LAUNCH
IN THE FACADE...
IS TYPICAL
OF THE SULLIVAN MILIEU.
YOU KNOW, TERRA-COTTA...
BECOMES ONE OF THE
MAJOR MATERIALS...
OF NEW YORK CITY ARCHITECTURE.
IT'S LIKE
A SAND-BAKED BRICK.
IT'S NOT QUITE GRANITE,
AND IT'S NOT QUITE BRICK.
IT WALKS
THE MAINSTREAM MIDDLE.
IT WAS EXCELLENT
FOR NEW YORK ARCHITECTURE...
BECAUSE IT COULD HANG OFF
THE SKELETONS OF THE BUILDINGS.
IT'S MUCH LIGHTER THAN STONE.
THE DIFFERENCE, THOUGH,
BETWEEN STONE AND TERRA-COTTA...
THAT STRIKES ME THE MOST...
IS THAT TERRA-COTTA REFLECTS THE
SUNLIGHT, AND STONE ABSORBS IT.
YOU CAN SEE THE BOUNCY LIGHT
ALONG THIS BUILDING.
WHEN I SEE TERRA-COTTA LIKE
THIS, IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL...
LIKE I'M SENSELESSLY RUNNING...
THROUGH A MEADOW OR
HIGH GRASSLAND AREA NUDE,
CHASING A WOMAN I'VE NEVER MET
BEFORE WHO'S ENTIRELY NUDE.
IT'S JUST THE MOST RAW
AND PRIMORDIAL CHASE.
TWO NUDE HUMAN BEINGS RUNNING
THROUGH GRASSLAND MARSH AREA.
AS YOU MOVE UP THE BUILDING,
CAN'T YOU FEEL THE
UNDULATIONS OF HER CURVATURE?
THE--
OHH! YES!
YES!
TH-THAT SLIGHT GROAN...
THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE
IN THE ACT OF INTERCOURSE.
THE, LIKE, "UHH!"
LIKE THE SOMEWHAT DYING GRUNT
OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN GRUNTING...
IN THE STORMS
OF HER OWN MALAISE.
YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE
METICULATIONS OF THE CORNICE LINES
OF THE TERRA-COTTA.
THAT'S WHY THE TERRA-COTTA
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.
IT'S THE "UHH,"
THE "UHH" MOMENTS OF LIFE.
UHH! UHH!
YES! YES!
OH, GOD, PLEASE!
THE BEGGING PARTS OF LIFE
ON THE LEFT SIDE.
YOU SEE THOSE LION-ESQUE
CHARACTERS WAY UP THERE?
PLEASE DON'T STOP.
PLEASE DON'T STOP.
HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME
IN THE BACK?
TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND TREES
ARE PLANTED,
TEN AND A HALF MILLION CARTLOADS
OF TOPSOIL IMPORTED...
AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES
OF DRAINAGE PIPES LAID,
AND THESE ARE
THE BASIC INGREDIENTS...
OF THE SUPPOSEDLY NATURAL
CREATION...
CALLED CENTRAL PARK.
THERE IS NOTHING NATURAL
ABOUT CENTRAL PARK.
WELCOME.
FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED,
THE ESSENTIAL LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT
OF THIS ORIGINAL CENTRAL PARK,
SEES A GROUP OF BOYS PLAYING A
PRIMORDIAL FORM OF BASEBALL...
ON THE LOWER PLAY LAWNS
IN THE 1850s,
AND AT THAT MOMENT OUTLAWS
BASEBALL FROM CENTRAL PARK.
THE MEN WHO BUILD AND DESIGN THIS
PARK ARE TRANSCENDENTALISTS.
TO THEM, CENTRAL PARK IS A
PLACE TO BECOME ONE WITH NATURE,
TO FOCUS ON TREES,
TO SCINTILLATE WITH GRASS,
TO STARE INTO
ONE ANOTHER'S EYES.
NO SWEATING ALLOWED
IN THE ORIGINAL CENTRAL PARK.
NO PERSPIRATION
OF ANY KIND.
ANYONE YOU SEE CONGREGATING
FOR THE BASEBALL GAME ON THE LEFT,
BICYCLING,
ROLLER-BLADING, JOGGING,
THEY ARE NOT
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.
ANYONE YOU SEE LOUNGING
IN THE SUN,
HAVING A PICNIC
OR KISSING,
THEY ARE
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.
ACK! "MUCHO" GRACIAS.
- MUCHAS GRACIAS.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- MUCHAS GRACIAS.
- SAY HOLA TO BUENOS AIRES FOR ME.
¿COMO?
SAY HELLO TO BUENOS AIRES
FOR ME.
- SAY HELLO?
- MM-HMM.
HELLO, YEAH. WHEN YOU
GET TO BUENOS AIRES.
- AH, YES.
- YES. SI.
THANK YOU.
- CIAO.
- BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL. WE'RE BEAUTIFUL.
THE PARK IS BEAUTIFUL.
- YES. THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK.
- NICE TO MEET YOU. CIAO.
- CIAO.
- ADIOS.
STYLE.
I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT BIDS.
WERE YOU INTERESTED IN TAKING ONE?
OH, UM, I LOOKED AT
WHAT'S LEFT.
THE ONES I WAS INTERESTED IN WERE
TAKEN. -JUST WANTED TO CHECK.
THE ONLY ONE I WOULD'VE BEEN
INTERESTED IN THAT WASN'T TAKEN...
WAS THAT 34.
BUT THAT'S GOT SUCH AN EARLY
HOTEL PICKUP, AND I-- YOU KNOW.
SO YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.
- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
- PICK A BID...
SO YOU'LL KNOW YOU'LL HAVE STEADY
WORK. -TAKE THE DAMN BID, LEVITCH!
YEAH, BUT I WAS TALKING TO TANYA.
THERE'S NO WAY TO REWRITE THE BIDS?
NO REWRITING. -LIKE--
THEY'RE, LIKE, WITH SOLIDITY.
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- TAKE THE BID, TIM.
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.
YOU DON'T CARE WHEN
YOU'RE UP AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ANYWAY AT 7:00 IN THE MORNING.
NEITHER DO I.
I'M DOIN' IT. YOU GET 20 HOURS
A WEEK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YEAH, YOU GET 20 HOURS A
WEEK, AND THAT'S ONE THING.
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT.
IT'S BEIN' DECIDED NOW.
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT
ANYWAY, TIM. -DON'T BE LATE.
RIGHT. -IT MAY BE
TOO LATE IN A FEW MINUTES.
- REALLY?
- REALLY.
THIS IS LIKE MY LAST FEW
MINUTES TO REALLY DECIDE.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I'LL TAKE THESE NEXT FEW MINUTES...
AND DEEPLY
CONTEMPLATE AND MAKE SURE.
IF I HAVE AN ESSENTIAL GOAL
ON THE CRUISE RIGHT NOW,
I THINK THAT
THE SIMPLEST GOAL...
IS PERHAPS TO--
TO BE ABLE TO EXHIBIT...
THAT I AM THRILLED
TO BE ALIVE...
AND TO BE STILL RESPECTED.
THE MORE SOULFUL OF US--
I SUPPOSE THE BUDDHIST OR
WHATEVER LABEL YOU WANT TO PUT...
ON THOSE EXPERIENCING
FURTHER INDIVIDUALITY...
MIGHT SAY, "LOOK, WHY SHOULD YOU
CARE ABOUT RESPECT FROM OTHERS?
"JUST THE THRILL OF BEING ALIVE
IS YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
YOU CAN DO THAT ALONE
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM".
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
THE CRUISE IS FOR ME.
THE CRUISE IS ABOUT
THE SEARCHINGS...
FOR EVERYTHING WORTHWHILE
IN EXISTENCE.
IT IS ABOUT WALKING INTO THE BAR
AND LUSTING AFTER...
ALL THE WORTHWHILE POSSIBILITIES
OF THE WORLD.
IT IS ABOUT FLESH.
IT IS ABOUT WAVES
UNDULATING.
AND IT IS ABOUT
EXHIBITIONISM.
YOU KNOW, I WANT
TO LOOK AT THE FLOWER...
AND APPRECIATE THE
BEAUTY OF A FLOWER.
SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT SAY,
"YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FLOWER
AND BECOME THE FLOWER.
ISN'T THAT EVEN BETTER?"
BUT THEN I FURTHER
WOULD LOVE IT ON THE CRUISE...
IF I CAN LOOK AT THE FLOWER,
APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY
OF THE FLOWER...
AND THEN HAVE THE FLOWER
APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF ME.
THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT CRUISING RIGHT NOW.
YES, BECOMING THE FLOWER WOULD
BE A LOT OF FUN. I CAN DO THAT TOO.
I CAN DO THAT ON WEDNESDAY.
I'M FREE THURSDAY AFTERNOON.
I CAN TRY TO BECOME THE FLOWER.
BUT COME THE WEEKEND,
GODDAMN IT,
I WILL APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF THE FLOWER,
AND THEN LIKEWISE,
I WILL STAND EXHIBITIONISTIC,
HAVING THE FLOWER APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF ME.
I THINK HAVING AN INTIMATE
"LOVE AFFAIR"...
WITH A FLOWER...
IS FAR MORE PSYCHOTIC
AND RIVETING...
THAN HAVING
"A LOVE AFFAIR"...
WITH SOME OF THE BANAL CREATURES
OF THE HUMAN RACE.
ALTHOUGH I'D BE
INTO THAT TOO.
WELCOME.
THIS IS MY FRIEND RUSSIO'S ROOM,
AND I'M CRASHING HERE RIGHT NOW.
CIVILIZATION...
IS THE AMPUTATION...
OF EVERYTHING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO US,
AN EXPERIMENT CREATED...
BY ALIENS...
UNABLE TO HAVE SEX.
CIVILIZATION
IS THE MOLESTATION...
OF EVERYTHING
WE EVER COULD BE,
A GIANT REPRESSION
MELTING INTO SUPPRESSION,
SO THAT YOU NEVER SAY
WHAT YOU MEAN.
CIVILIZATION...
IS BREATHING DOWN OUR NECKS,
SPLITTING US APART.
WE ARE WRECKAGE...
WITH BEATING HEARTS.
CIVILIZATION
IS A CAN OF HAIR SPRAY...
SPRAYING FOR
THE SEASONLESS VEIN...
INTO A HAIR NET
MADE UP OF CURLS,
ONLY EVER MEANT TO BE WAVES.
CIVILIZATION--
GENOCIDE BELIEFS,
MORALISTIC,
SEE-THROUGH LACE BLOUSES,
MISSILES BALLISTIC,
LACKADAISICAL,
MELANCHOLIC RED LIPSTICK.
WHEN ONE FEELS NAUSEOUS
BUT DOESN'T FEEL SICK.
CIVILIZATION
KNEW WHO YOU WERE...
BEFORE YOU WERE EVER BORN,
FORGAVE YOU WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU NEEDED FORGIVING.
AND YOU NEVER ONCE...
SURPRISED...
THIS CIVILIZATION.
AND YOU NEVER ONCE FELT...
THAT SENSATION.
ANY PASSENGERS GOING TO THE
CIRCLE LINE BOAT...
ARE TO CHECK IN
AT THE FRONT DESK.
LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
ANYBODY GOING TO
THE CIRCLE LINE BOAT
FOR NEW YORK WATERWAYS CRUISE,
PLEASE CHECK IN TO
THE FRONT DESK,
LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE
WAITING FOR THAT BUS.
OKAY, TIMMY,
READY TO ROLL?
READY TO ROLL. LET'S DO IT
RIGHT. LET'S FUCKING TOUR.
I WANNA GO HOME.
FOURTEEN HUNDRED
AND SEVENTY-SIX FEET...
OF ORGANIZED
GRANITE AND LIMESTONE.
SIXTY-FOUR HUNDRED
WINDOWS.
TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND
RENTABLE INTERIOR METERS OF SPACE.
SEVEN MILES
OF ELEVATOR SHAFTS.
A SLICE OF THE STATE
OF INDIANA...
VAULTED ONTO THE CORNER
OF 34th STREET AND FIFTH AVENUE.
KING KONG CLIMBED IT.
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
WILL BE IN FRONT OF US...
WHEN O'SHAYNE MAKES
THE MASCULINE TURN.
IF ARCHITECTURE IS THE HISTORY
OF ALL PHALLIC EMOTION,
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING...
IS UTTER CATHARSIS,
AND WE ARE SITTING
IN ITS SILHOUETTE.
THE BEAUTIFUL PYRAMID
ATOP THE CHRYSLER BUILDING,
MEANT TO BE A REPLICA
OF THE FRONT GRILLE...
ON A 1928 CHRYSLER CAR.
LEWIS MUMFORD, THE MAJOR
ARCHITECTURAL CRITIC OF THAT ERA,
CALLED
THE CHRYSLER BUILDING...
QUOTE,
"UNINSPIRED VOLUPTUOUSNESS".
END QUOTE.
UNINSPIRED VOLUPTUOUSNESS...
IN THE SUNLIGHT.
SUNLIGHT-- POWERFUL.
THE SUN, ANOTHER GREAT
NEW YORK CITY LANDMARK,
ABOVE YOU ON THE LEFT.
THE ARCH IN THE PARK WILL BE
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BUS...
WHEN O'SHAYNE SWINGS US
ONTO 14th STREET.
AND 14th STREET IS THE WIDEST
STREET OF MANHATTAN ISLAND.
THIS IS WHERE THE ISLAND IS...
LITERALLY TWO AND
A HALF MILES WIDE.
AND THAT IS IT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THAT IS ALL.
TWO AND HALF MILES IS AS WIDE
AS THIS CACOPHONY GETS.
THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILES LONG.
2.4 MILLION PEOPLE.
BE 1.7 MILLION PEOPLE,
I HEARD RECENTLY, BUT I DON'T CARE.
THE FULTON FISH MARKET...
WILL BE MORE OF AN ODOR THAN A
LANDMARK AT THIS TIME OF DAY,
BUT IT REALLY SWINGS OUT
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.
ANOTHER TIMOTHY SPEED LEVITCH
RECOMMENDATION,
IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP
AND YOU LIKE FISH.
I HOPE YOU CAN FEEL
THE OMNISCIENCE OF THIS MOMENT,
AS WE HAVE BEEN
BLOCKING THIS TRAFFIC...
AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT.
SENSE THE GRANDEUR
OF YOUR POWER...
AS WE DISRUPT ONE LIFE
AFTER ANOTHER.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NAME IS
TIMOTHY. FONTANEZ IS DOWNSTAIRS.
IF YOU NEED ADVICE
OR DIRECTIONS ON NEW YORK CITY,
ON STYLE, ON HOW TO APPEAR
AS A DEBONAIR INDIVIDUAL...
DESPITE INTERIOR FEELINGS
OF DESPAIR,
LET US KNOW.
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT
TOURISM IS A SERVICE TRADE,
AND TIPS ARE ALWAYS APPRECIATED.
WE MEAN THAT.
WE WILL REMEMBER YOU.
THIS IS OUR
CENTRAL PARK SOUTH STOP.
OH, IT'S BIG MONEY,
FONTANEZ.
YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT LATER,
TAKE YOUR CHILDREN
OUT... -AND GET DRUNK.
...FOR SOME ICE CREAM
CONES. -AND GET DRUNK.
YEAH, THAT TOO. WOW.
ONE OF THE GREAT TRAGEDIES
OF THIS EXPERIMENT
CALLED CIVILIZATION...
IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE
HAVE TO WORK FOR A LIVING.
IT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING,
IF I HAD A CHOICE--
OTHER THAN MY ACNE--
I THINK WOULD BE THE FIRST THING
I WOULD REMOVE FROM MY LIFE.
IF I COULD ERASE AN
ASPECT OF MY LIFE,
IT WOULD BE THIS NEED
TO WORK FOR A LIVING.
YOU UNDERSTAND, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE TOUR ITSELF.
WHEN I'M ON THE TOUR ITSELF...
AND I'M SHOWING OTHERS
THE APPRECIATION OF BEAUTY...
AND THE HUGENESS OF ALL THIS,
AND EXPERIENCING THE LASCIVIOUS
VOYEURISM OF THE TOUR BUS,
AND EROTICIZING WOMEN
IN A CONSPIRACY WITH THIS CITY,
AND HAVING SPIRITUAL
TANTRIC CONNECTIONS...
WITH INTERNATIONAL
FLESH CONGREGATIONS,
THIS IS NOT, IN MY MIND,
WORKING FOR A LIVING.
YET, AT THE SAME TIME,
IT IS,
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE WEEK
WHEN I'VE MADE $200 AFTER TAXES...
AND I HAVE ALL THESE OTHER
PRAGMATIC EXPENSES...
JUST TO KEEP THE CRUISE ALIVE,
YOU KNOW, IT'S RIDICULOUS.
I CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER WAKE UP
EARLY IN THE MORNING AGAIN,
NOT UNLESS I WAS CRUISING.
THE ROADS AROUND YOU NOW...
WILL BECOME CLAUSTROPHOBIC
AND NARROW IN FEELING.
AND THIS WILL NOT JUST BE
YOUR OWN PROJECTION.
THE ROADS ARE CLAUSTROPHOBIC
AND NARROW IN FEELING.
THESE ARE THE OLDEST ROADWAYS
OF MANHATTAN ISLAND.
THESE DESIGNED BY THE DUTCH
IN THE EARLY 17th CENTURY.
WELCOME TO NEW AMSTERDAM.
FONTANEZ CONTINUES TO
AUDACIOUSLY IMPROVISE,
NOT ONLY WITH THE TOUR ROUTE,
BUT WITH HIS OWN LIFE.
NEXT DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP
IS IN 20 MINUTES.
NO MORE BOARDING AT THIS TIME.
NEXT DOUBLE-DECKER
LOOP TOUR IS IN 20 MINUTES.
NO BOARDING AT THIS TIME.
YOU'VE GOT BLOOD ALL OVER YOU.
FUCKIN' SHAVING THIS MORNING
WAS LIKE A CARNAGE.
JUST CLEAN YOURSELF UP. -THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO.
GEORGE WAS CRITICIZING
THE LINING.
I'LL GRANT YOU, IT'S NOT IN
GOOD SHAPE. IT NEEDS NEW LINING.
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
THAT SHOULD AFFECT MY, YOU KNOW--
THE COSMETICS ARE A TRICKY THING
ON THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS.
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF SIMPLE...
...CONFORMIST FASTIDIOUSNESS,
YOU KNOW.
I'M NOT DRESSING TO IMPRESS
MY GRANDMOTHER, YOU KNOW.
I AM, IN A LAUNCHING
AND VITRIOLIC WAY,
TRYING, AT ANY EXPENSE,
TO GRAB THE COLLARS OF PEOPLE...
WHO HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY...
AND TRYING TO GRAB
THEIR ATTENTION...
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE GREATEST TUMULTUOUSNESS.
AND RIPPED LINING
IS PART OF THAT ROUTINE.
I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO
UNDERSTAND THAT, THOUGH,
BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER DONE IT.
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THEIR DOUBLE-DECKER TOUR.
ST. PAUL'S CHURCH, IN BROWN,
IN FRONT OF THE BUS,
SITTING ON BROADWAY ITSELF,
WAS BUILT BY THE BRITISH EMPIRE...
WHEN THIS WAS STILL
A COLONY IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE...
AND NOT A STATE
IN THE UNION.
GEORGE WASHINGTON--
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM.
HE TOOK HIS OATH OF OFFICE...
AS THE FIRST PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES...
AT THE CORNER
OF WALL STREET AND BROAD,
APRIL 30, 1789.
JUST AFTER THE OATH, WASHINGTON
IS MARCHED IN A PROCESSION HERE...
ON THE LEFT, UP BROADWAY,
TAKING A FURTHER LEFT TURN
INTO ST. PAUL'S CHURCH.
WASHINGTON KNEELS AT THE ALTAR
ON A PILLOW...
AND PRAYS FOR THE FUTURE
OF THE UNION.
THE PILLOW STILL SITS
UNDER GLASS...
AT THE ALTAR IN ST. PAUL'S,
ON YOUR LEFT.
"I LOVE THE MAN
THAT CAN SMILE IN TROUBLE,
"THAT CAN GATHER STRENGTH
IN TOTAL DISTRESS...
AND GROW BY REFLECTION".
THOMAS PAINE PARK.
YOU KNOW, ACCORDING
TO THE CITY REPORTS,
ELEVEN PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED
OFF THIS BRIDGE...
AND SURVIVED.
ONE OF MY CRUISING
DREAMS WOULD BE...
TO GET A CRUISE TOGETHER
WITH THOSE 11.
I LOVE THESE THINGS.
I CRUISED THIS BRIDGE
ONCE SOLO...
WHEN I WAS IN
A SEVERE SOLO ANGST,
WHEN THE ENTIRE WORLD HAD
DIVORCED ITSELF FROM ME...
ON A SINGULAR EVENING,
WHICH IS USUALLY
ON TUESDAY NIGHTS.
AND, UH,
I CRUISED THE BRIDGE,
REALIZING THAT, UH,
THE PILLARS OF STONE...
WERE MY FRIENDS.
THEY REALLY
MAKE ME FEEL WHOLE.
THEY REMIND ME THAT MY FUTURE
HAS A BRIGHTNESS, PERHAPS.
EVEN IF I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO BELIEVES THAT,
I KNOW THEY BELIEVE IT.
ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT...
HAVING THE TRIPTYCHS OF
THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AS A FRIEND,
CERTAINLY, IS THAT
IT NEVER CONTRADICTS ME.
IF IT MAKES ME FEEL FUTILE,
IT DOES IT INDIRECTLY,
WITH A SUBTLETY.
IT DOES IT WITH AN AMBIVALENCE
AND AN ALOOFNESS.
THERE'S NO VICTORY
IN ITS SUBJUGATION OF ME.
IF IT SUBJUGATES ME,
THAT'S THE DELUSION,
THE POWER OF MY OWN MIND.
THE BEST MOMENTS IN
OUR FRIENDSHIPS...
ARE WHEN I BECOME THE
BROOKLYN BRIDGE IN MY MIND,
WHEN I REALIZE
THAT WE ARE EQUALS.
THESE ARE
THE WORLD TRADE CENTERS.
YEAH, SEE THESE TWO TOWERS?
THE TWIN TOWERS, SEE?
BROTHERS.
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO, UM,
SPIN IN BETWEEN
THE TWO TOWERS.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UM, SPIN AROUND
AND YOU MAKE YOURSELF DIZZY?
THEN YOU LOOK UP,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE BUILDINGS
ARE FALLING IN ON TOP OF YOU.
YEAH, I RECOMMEND THAT.
IT'S FUN.
IF YOU GET TO STAND IN THE
PLAZA BETWEEN THE TWO TOWERS.
BUT DON'T LOOK UP
UNTIL AFTER YOU'RE DIZZY.
GOOD VIEW
OF COMMUTERS...
RUNNING TOWARDS
THEIR DESTINATIONS...
AND FROM THEMSELVES.
I THINK THAT WHEN I
THINK ABOUT MY FUTURE,
INTERESTINGLY, I THINK
ABOUT MY GRANDPARENTS,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
MY GRANDPARENTS
ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
I SPENT MANY
FORMATIVE MOMENTS...
IN MY FORMATIVE YEARS
WITH THEM.
ALL OF MY SUMMERS
WERE CRUISING WITH THEM.
AND FROM THEIR
POINT OF VIEW,
I KNOW THAT THEY FEEL
THAT I AM CURRENTLY A FAILURE...
AND WILL ALWAYS BE
A DOWNTRODDEN FAILURE.
AND I THINK THAT OFTEN THAT
MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FUTURE...
VEER TOWARDS THEIR POINTS
OF VIEW ON THE UNIVERSE,
WHAT THEY CONSIDER
TO BE IMPORTANT,
AND WHAT THEY CONSIDER
TO BE IMPORTANT...
IS A BASIC SELF-PRESERVATIONISM...
AND SECURITY THAT I AM NOT
CREATING FOR MYSELF.
WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE
IMPORTANT IS HAVING AN OCCUPATION,
A NICHE IN SOCIETY,
SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE AT A PARTY AND
SOMEBODY ASKS YOU WHAT YOU DO,
YOU'LL HAVE
A SINGLE-WORD ANSWER...
OR AT LEAST YOU CAN ANSWER
WITHIN A SENTENCE.
WELCOME. I KNOW THAT THEY
THINK THAT I'M NOT ALTOGETHER...
WITH MY FEET ON THE GROUND.
I KNOW THAT THEY FEEL THEY'RE
GOING TO BE DYING VERY SOON...
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I AM
GOING TO KIND OF FADE OUT...
INTO A SUPRATERRESTRIAL
FAILURE.
A SERIES OF AGGRAVATIONS,
A SERIES OF FRUSTRATIONS.
THEIR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN ME
FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY LIFE...
IS SOMETHING I'VE
ALWAYS BEEN CONTENDING WITH...
AND ALWAYS BEEN OBSESSED WITH.
BYE-BYE. THANK YOU.
IF I HAD AN IMMEDIATE GOAL
ON AN AFTERNOON LIKE TODAY,
IT WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE
SOME CONCRETENESS TO THEM,
TO GIVE THEM
A PLATTER OF SUCCESS,
EVEN IF IT WAS ONE ANECDOTE.
SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD,
IN THEIR OWN WORLD...
AND THEIR OWN VERNACULAR,
TASTE AND SAY,
"YES, HE DOES HAVE SOMETHING.
THERE IS HOPE.
THERE IS SOME SORT
OF SUCCESS IN HIS LIFE".
I GRANT YOU,
ALL THESE WORDS I'M USING
ARE KIND OF BLAND AND VAGUE TERMS,
BUT IN MY GRANDPARENTS' WORLD,
THEY'RE THE MOST CONCRETE AND
ABSORBING GOALS A PERSON CAN HAVE.
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE
ABLE TO TELL MY GRANDPARENTS...
THAT I'VE DONE SOMETHING
THAT THEY CAN APPRECIATE,
THAT THEY CAN RESPECT.
I REALLY, REALLY
DO NOT WANT TO BECOME...
THE PERSON THAT THEY THINK
THAT I'M GOING TO BECOME.
THE, UH, IMAGE MAKES ME THINK
OF THIS CONVERSATION,
UH, WITH THIS WOMAN
THE OTHER DAY.
SHE WAS A FASTIDIOUS, JUDAIC-TYPE
WOMAN IN VERY SEXUAL SLACKS.
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE GRID PLAN.
AND I MADE THE COMMENT
ABOUT HOW, YOU KNOW,
THE GRID PLAN EMANATES
FROM OUR WEAKNESSES,
THIS LAYOUT OF AVENUES
AND STREETS IN NEW YORK CITY,
THIS SYSTEM
OF 90-DEGREE ANGLES.
TO ME, THE GRID PLAN IS PURITAN,
IT'S HOMOGENIZING,
IN A CITY WHERE THERE IS
NO HOMOGENIZATION AVAILABLE.
THERE IS ONLY TOTAL EXISTENCE,
TOTAL CACOPHONY,
A TOTAL FLOWING OF HUMAN
ETHNICITIES AND TRIBES AND BEINGS...
AND GRADATIONS OF AWARENESS
AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND CRUISING.
AND--
THIS WOMAN TURNS TO ME. SHE GOES,
"I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT".
SHE GOES, "I CAN'T IMAGINE IT.
EVERYONE LIKES THE GRID PLAN".
OF COURSE,
THE QUESTION IS,
"WHO IS EVERYONE?"
IT'S JUST WHAT I HAD SAID.
WHOEVER THAT IS
UNDER THE WHITE COMFORTER,
CUDDLED UP WITH 34th STREET
AND BROADWAY,
EXISTING ON THE CONCRETE
OF THIS CITY,
HUNGRY AND DISHEVELLED,
STRUGGLING TO CRAWL
THEIR WAY ONTO THIS ISLAND...
WITH ALL OF THEIR MACHINATED
RAGES AND HELLISHNESS...
AND SELF-ORCHESTRATED
PURGATORIES--
I MEAN, WHAT DOES THAT PERSON
THINK ABOUT THE GRID PLAN?
PROBABLY MUCH MORE ON MY PLANE
OF THINKING, MY GRADATION OF BEING,
WHICH IS, LET'S JUST
BLOW UP THE GRID PLAN...
AND REWRITE THE STREETS TO BE...
MUCH MORE A SELF-PORTRAITURE
OF OUR PERSONAL STRUGGLES,
RATHER THAN SOME REAL ESTATE
BROKER'S WET DREAM FROM 1807.
WE'RE FORCED TO WALK
IN THESE RIGHT ANGLES.
DOESN'T SHE FIND IT
INFURIATING?
BY BEING SO COMPLETELY
ALLEGIANT TO THE GRID PLAN--
I THINK MOST NOTEWORTHY
IS THIS IDIOM:
"I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
CHANGING THE GRID PLAN".
SHE'S REALLY, UH,
ALIGNING HERSELF...
WITH THIS CIVILIZATION.
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "I CAN'T IMAGINE
ALTERING THIS CIVILIZATION.
"I CAN'T IMAGINE ALTERING
THIS MEEK AND LYING MORALITY...
"THAT RULES OUR LIVES.
"CAN'T IMAGINE STANDING UP ON A
CHAIR IN THE ROOM...
"TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVE.
"I CAN'T IMAGINE CHANGING
MY MIND ON ANYTHING.
"I, IN THE END, CAN'T IMAGINE
HAVING MY OWN IDENTITY...
THAT CONTRADICTS
OTHER IDENTITIES".
WHEN SHE SAYS TO ME,
AFTER MY STATEMENTS,
"EVERYONE LIKES
THE GRID PLAN,"
ISN'T SHE AUTOMATICALLY
EXCLUDING MYSELF FROM "EVERYONE"?
HOW COULD YOU NOT LIKE
THE GRID PLAN?
IT'S SO FUNCTIONAL.
YOU TAKE A RIGHT TURN,
A RIGHT TURN, A RIGHT TURN.
THERE'S A RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT,
YELLOW LIGHT. IT'S SO SYMMETRICAL.
BY SAYING THAT EVERYONE
LIKES THE GRID PLAN,
YOU'RE SAYING, "I'M GOING TO RELIVE
ALL THE MISTAKES MY PARENTS MADE.
"I'M GOING TO IDENTIFY
AND RELIVE ALL THE SORROWS...
"MY MOTHER EVER
LIVED THROUGH.
"I WILL PROPAGATE AND CREATE
DYSFUNCTIONAL CHILDREN...
"IN THE SAME DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY
THAT I WAS RAISED.
"I WILL SPREAD NEUROSIS
THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE...
"AND DO MY BEST...
"TO RECREATE MYSELF
AND THE DAMAGES OF MY LIFE...
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION".
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL MAPS
OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN,
EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THIS CENTURY,
MADISON AVENUE,
IN FRONT OF YOU, IN BACK OF YOU,
IS NOT EVEN ON THE MAP.
THIS BEGINS AS A SERVICE ROAD
FOR FIFTH AVENUE,
ONE BLOCK TO THE WEST.
FIFTH AVENUE IS
"MILLIONAIRE'S ROW,"
A SYSTEM OF
ARISTOCRATIC MANSIONS.
THIS IS WHERE
THE HORSE STABLES ARE.
THIS IS WHERE THE GARDENERS'
SHACKS ARE, NOT THAT LONG AGO.
MADISON AVENUE,
NOT EVEN A BOULEVARD...
UNTIL THE AUTOMOBILE
TAKES OVER THE ISLAND.
WILL YOU LOOK AT IT TODAY.
MAY I RESTATE, RECAPITULATE...
AND GENERALLY REGURGITATE,
WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN THE
MIDDLE OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN,
YOU ARE SITTING AMONGST
A 20th-CENTURY INVENTION,
A CITY THAT GREW UP
AT AN EXPLOSION, AS AN EXPLOSION.
IT IS AN EXPLOSION,
AN EXPERIMENT,
A SYSTEM OF TEST TUBES GURGLING,
BOILING OUT OF CONTROL,
A RADIOACTIVE ATOM
SWIRLING.
CIVILIZATION HAS NEVER
LOOKED LIKE THIS BEFORE.
THIS IS LUDICROUSNESS,
AND THIS CANNOT LAST.
THE NEW ANN TAYLOR STORE
ON THE RIGHT.
YESTERDAY GRAY LINE
FINALLY ENFORCED THEIR, UH,
UM, OBLIGATORY
UNIFORM POLICY.
IT'S A NEW POLICY.
WE HAVE TO--
ALL THE TOUR GUIDES HAVE TO WEAR...
GRAY LINE
BRIGHT RED SHIRTS.
AND CERTAINLY MY ILLNESS,
I THINK, IS ASSOCIATED...
WITH THIS LATEST
LEGISLATION.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT I CAME...
TO THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS
FOR EMPLOYMENT...
FOR ONE REASON
AND ONE ESSENTIAL REASON ONLY,
AND THAT WAS TO, UH,
MEET WOMEN,
TO MEET AND SEDUCE WOMEN...
FROM EVERY HABITABLE
CONTINENT IN THE WORLD.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE.
I'M CERTAINLY NOT
HERE FOR THE MONEY.
AND, UM, THEY'RE JUST
LITERALLY BLOWING MY SHTICK.
I SAID TO GEORGE YESTERDAY,
BECAUSE
THE DISPATCHERS BASICALLY SAID,
"IF YOU DON'T PUT ON THAT SHIRT,
WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU HOME EARLY".
IT CAN LEAD
TO MY TERMINATION.
THAT'S HOW SERIOUS
THEY ARE ABOUT THIS.
I SAID, "AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,
"THE OFFICIAL GRAY LINE POLICY
AT THIS POINT IS, YOU KNOW,
"'SPEED, YOU ARE NOT GONNA
GET LAID ON OUR BUSES.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE'."
THEY'RE GONNA
MAKE ME PULL A SHTICK...
THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS PULLIN',
AND IT'S TERRIBLE.
AND, UH, REALLY,
MOSTLY IT'S JUST THE REGIME
SENDING OUT A MESSAGE...
THAT I'M ENTIRELY REPLACEABLE.
IT'S THEM SAYING,
"WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR TOUR.
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
"YOU WEAR THIS SHIRT, AND IF
YOU DON'T CONFORM, YOU'RE OUT,
'CAUSE WE CAN REPLACE YOU".
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS CITY
RIGHT NOW IS SEVEN PERCENT.
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IN FRONT OF US.
"ANTI,"
AS OPPOSED TO "CRUISE".
THIS IS AN ELEMENTARY AND VERY
PHYSICAL EXAMPLE OF ANTI-CRUISE,
WHERE OUR IMMOBILITY...
IS CREATED BY LITERALLY
JUST A BLOCKADE OF THE SIDEWALK.
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IS EVERYWHERE.
EVERY GOOD DAY OF MY LIFE
IS A DAY I EVADE THE ANTI-CRUISE.
PLEASE KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN,
'CAUSE I DO SENSE A LOT OF THAT
NEGATIVE FODDER IN THE AIR.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT THIS IS A VERY
ECLECTIC AND DANGEROUS AFTERNOON.
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IS CERTAINLY MOBILIZED TODAY.
ON OUR LEFT WILL BE
THE CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE,
CAPITAL OF INCARCERATION.
INCARCERATION, ANOTHER BASIC
ASPECT OF OUR DAILY LIVES,
UTILIZED
IN AN UNORIGINAL WAY...
IN THE CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE
ON OUR LEFT.
AND I CAN PERSONALLY
VOUCH FOR THAT.
THE ANTI-CRUISE IS AN ATTEMPT
TO IMPRISON US.
AT EVERY LEVEL OF LIVING,
IT EXISTS.
YOUNGER CRUISERS
HAVE ASKED ME, "WHY?
"WHY IS THE ANTI-CRUISE
SO AVARICIOUS AND CONSTANT...
IN ITS ATTEMPT
TO STOP THE CRUISE?"
AND I HAVE NO ANSWER.
THERE IS NO ANSWER.
I MEAN,
IT'S GRAVITATIONAL.
IT'S A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S
MADE UP OF RECIPROCALS...
AND OF PULLING GRAVITIES.
IT SIMPLY EXISTS.
WHERE THERE IS CRUISE,
THERE IS AN ESCORT OF ANTI-CRUISE.
BUT EVEN IN A COMPLETE BASTION...
OF ANTI-CRUISE FODDER,
WHICH THIS ENTIRE
SQUARE BLOCK IS,
THERE IS CRUISE.
SOMEWHERE IN THERE IS
A SPARKLE OF CRUISING ENERGY...
DEEPLY SUBLIMATED WITHIN THE
BELLOWING BELLY OF THE BEAST.
SURVIVOR.
HE KNOWS NO PRISON.
THEY WERE ALL OVER
THE PRISON FLOOR,
BUT YOU NEVER SAW THEM
LOOKING MELANCHOLY.
THEY KEPT CRUISIN'.
NO IMPRISONMENT
FOR THE COCKROACH.
LIFE-IMPENDING
DRASTIC SURVIVOR.
THROUGH THE MILLENNIAS,
THROUGH THE ERUPTIONS OF TIME,
PAST THE DINOSAURS,
WITNESSING THE FLIGHT
OF BIRDS FOR THE FIRST TIME,
CLOUDS DYING,
ASTEROIDS HITTING THE EARTH.
NO PRISON FOR THE COCKROACH.
I HAVE SUCH RESPECT
FOR THOSE BASTARDS.
BUT I WAS NOT SO FORTUNATE.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS
CRUISING HARD AT THAT TIME,
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT--
THE ANTI-CRUISE REALLY
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK...
COULD NOT ALLOW ME
EVEN PHYSICAL MOBILITY.
I WAS-- ACCORDING TO THEM,
I WAS RUNNING FROM
THE COPS FOR A MONTH...
BEFORE THEY CAUGHT UP TO ME.
I WAS NOT EVEN AWARE
THAT I WAS RUNNING FROM THE COPS...
AS MUCH AS FROM THE ANTI-CRUISE.
I FELT LIKE A FUGITIVE,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVERY DAY I FEEL
LIKE A FUGITIVE.
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THEM...
THAT I'M RUNNING
FROM THE ANTI-CRUISE EVERY DAY.
WHEN I WAS UP IN FRONT OF THE
JUDGE FOR MY ARRAIGNMENT,
THE JUDGE SAID,
"MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH
THIS CASE IS THAT THIS GUY--
"THIS CURRENT PERSON
WE'RE JUDGING--
RAN FROM THE POLICE
FOR A MONTH".
IF I COULD HAVE SPOKEN-- OF COURSE,
I WASN'T ALLOWED TO SPEAK--
I WOULD HAVE SAID,
"IT'S BEEN A LOT MORE THAN A MONTH.
"I'VE BEEN RUNNING
FROM YOU PEOPLE ALL MY LIFE.
ALL MY LIFE.
AND I'M GONNA KEEP RUNNING".
THERE ARE SO MANY PRISONERS,
INMATES, SO MANY
PEOPLE TO BE JUDGED,
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO
CONSIDER YOU AS A HUMAN BEING.
YOU'RE FILED THROUGH
AS IN AN ASSEMBLY LINE.
IN SOME WAYS,
IT MADE ME THINK OF THE FACT THAT
IN TERMS OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,
WE HAVE THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE
AS PLANTS.
SO THIS ENTIRE
NOTION OF INDIVIDUALITY...
IS A DELUSION ANYWAY.
IT IS A DIREFUL DELUSION.
THERE IS NO REAL INDIVIDUALITY
EXCEPT FOR THAT WHICH WE PROJECT.
BUT SITTING IN THE CELL BLOCK,
I REALIZED THAT THE PURSUIT OF
THAT SO-CALLED INDIVIDUALITY...
IS EVERYTHING I BELIEVE IN.
THE FULLEST PURSUIT OF THOSE...
POSSIBILITIES OF THAT
"INDIVIDUALITY,"
EVEN IF IT IS
AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE,
IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
FAILURE I CAN THINK OF.
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S A DELUSION.
I DON'T CARE IF WE HAVE
THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE AS PLANTS.
I WANT TO BE THE PLANT
THAT GROWS THE HIGHEST.
I WANT TO BE THE BEAN STALK.
I WANT TO BE THE FLOWER...
THAT SMELLS MOST PROFUSELY,
THAT VEERS MOST DRASTICALLY
TOWARDS THE SUNLIGHT.
LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL
LEAVES, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
YOU SEE THAT?
SEE HOW STUBBORN THIS LEAF IS?
I'M TRYING TO PICK IT UP, LIKE LOOK,
PICK UP THE SPIRIT.
LIKE PICK IT UP NOW.
LET'S GET SOME EXPANSION.
LET'S GET SOME ERECTION GOIN'.
HE'S LIKE, "I'M FLACCID. I'M NOT
MOVIN'. I'M NOT DOIN' IT TODAY".
COME ON, IT'S WEST 67th STREET.
IT'S SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
IT'S AUGUST. DO THIS.
"NO, NO, NO".
COME ON, GET IT UP.
"NO, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TODAY".
COME ON NOW!
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
HE'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
DIFFERENT COLOR,
DIFFERENT ATTITUDE.
LOOK AT THAT STYLE.
AND THEY MOVE WITH YOU.
THEY'VE GOT SUCH MOBILITY THERE.
THIS GUY'S LIKE STREAMLINED,
LIKE SEXY.
SO SEXY.
LOOK AT THOSE LINES.
AN AIRPLANE.
BEAUTIFUL.
GOTTA RISE.
RISE.
RISE TO THE OCCASION.
THESE PEOPLE ARE
ON THE 12:00 DOWN,
AND THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE IT TO ME.
THE 12:00 DOWN ON THIS PARTICULAR
DAY WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE
UNDERSTANDING THAT RIGHT NOW.
LOOK AT THIS.
RISE.
GO FOR IT.
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.
GOOD-BYE.
GOOD LUCK.
I THINK THAT MY FAVORITE VICTORY
IS THE ABILITY TO FEEL.
SUCH INSINCERITY--
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IF THE CRUISE IS ANYTHING,
BE IT APPRECIATION, BE IT A VOYAGE,
BE IT AN ADVENTURE
THAT LEADS BACK TO OURSELVES,
BE IT A CARTWHEEL
OR A SOMERSAULT--
IF YOU FIND THE CRUISE IN A PIECE
OF CARROT CAKE, A TOPLESS BAR,
THE ONE THING THE CRUISE
ALWAYS IS, I THINK, IS SINCERE.
AND SINCERITY IS ONE OF MY
FAVORITE VICTORIES IN THIS LIFETIME.
I MEAN, HOW MUCH REBELLION
DID I HAVE TO EXPERIENCE?
HOW MUCH FIGHTING DID I DO?
HOW MANY TIMES DID
I HAVE TO IGNORE...
MY FATHER'S INABILITY TO EMOTE?
HOW WE ALL IGNORE OUR FATHERS'
INABILITY TO EMOTE IN OUR PRESENCE.
HOW MUCH AIR-CONDITIONING
DID I HAVE TO TRANSCEND...
AND THE COMFORT
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT?
THE COMFORTABLE COUCHES,
THE TELEVISION,
THE MAGNITUDE OF STATIC
THAT SURROUNDS US.
HOW MUCH DAILY INFIGHTING,
STRATEGIZING, EVADING, RUNNING...
DID I HAVE TO DO
FOR THE ABILITY TO FEEL,
FOR THE ABILITY TO EMOTE,
FOR THE SIMPLE MOMENTS
WHEN I FEEL ACTUAL PASSION?
HELLO, EVERYONE.
CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THE BACK?
WELCOME TO NEW YORK CITY.
H.G. WELLS ONCE WROTE
THAT TO TELL
THE SOCIAL HISTORY
OF NEW YORK CITY...
IS TO TELL THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD, THE STORY OF THE WORLD.
IT'S GOING TO BE
A LONG MORNING.
TO ALL MY ENEMIES
WHO ADD FLAVOR TO MY LIFE,
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT?
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
AND TALK TO ME ABOUT IT?
TO LESLIE LINDENSTRAUS:
LOOK, IF YOU WANNA TRY TO CHOKE
ME WHEN I'M, LIKE, PREPUBESCENT...
AND REALLY MUCH SMALLER
THAN YOU, THAT'S FINE.
I KNOW THAT'S HOW WE ALL
REALLY FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER,
AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT
IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT.
BUT I'M GONNA FIND YOU AND KICK
YOUR ASS 'CAUSE I'M NOT SEVEN...
AND PREPUBESCENT ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE,
BUT I REMEMBER THAT DAY.
TO JORDAN:
LOOK, BANANAS MAY BE SOMETHING...
THAT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
CAN EAT WITHOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?
YES, I WANTED A BANANA
AND YES, YOU LEFT ME OUT.
BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE
THERE ARE OTHER BANANAS.
I THINK I PROVED THAT
TO YOU BY NOW.
TO TIRZAH:
THERE WAS ABOUT TWO HOURS OF
MY ENTIRE LIFE THUS FAR ON EARTH...
WHEN I WAS ABSOLUTELY
DEPENDENT UPON YOU.
AND THOSE WERE A COUPLE
OF THE WORST HOURS OF MY LIFE.
TO CHARLES PURPURRA: I KNOW
YOU NEVER READ MY SCREENPLAY.
AND TO LESLIE LEE: I KNOW YOU
DIDN'T READ THAT FULL-LENGTH PLAY.
I WORKED ON IT. I SWEATED
ON IT. I TURMOILED OVER IT.
I MALAISED THROUGH IT.
I LIVED ABOVE IT, UNDER IT,
BECAUSE OF IT, NOT BECAUSE OF IT.
I HATED IT. I LOVED IT.
I DIED AND I WAS REBORN WITHIN THE
ROOM AS I WORKED ON THAT PLAY,
AND I KNOW
YOU DID NOT READ IT.
TO SWAYNE,
WHO SUPPOSEDLY WAS GOING
TO READ THAT SCRIPT I GAVE HIM.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
FUCK THE SCRIPT.
YOU ARE FOREVER KNOWN
AS THE TOUR GUIDE...
WHO GOT HIT BY A TRAFFIC LIGHT.
AND I THINK THAT'S
THE PROPER EPITHET FOR YOU.
AND HOW DARE YOU
DO A TINA HOWE PLAY...
IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE
IN NEW YORK CITY,
AS IF I HAVE TIME TO SIT THERE
AND LISTEN TO THAT TRASH...
WHEN THERE IS SHTICKING
AND CRUISING TO BE DONE.
YOU OBVIOUSLY LEAD
AN "INFINTESTIMIAL" EXISTENCE.
TO JOSH:
YOUR NARCISSISM...
IS MEDIOCRE.
NARCISSISM IN SOME WAYS
IS INEVITABLE.
I MEAN, SINCE WE'RE ALL LIVING IN
THE SAME BODIES FOR THIS MORTALITY,
IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE
THAT WE WILL BE...
SELF-ABSORBED AT SOME POINT.
BUT WHY IS IT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE
HAVE A NARCISSISM AS YOURSELF...
THAT LEADS TO MEDIOCRITY
AND NOTHING ELSE?
TO JEN AND MICHELLE:
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ORGY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT
CAME DOWN TO A DOUBLE DATE...
WITH ME AS A FIFTH WHEEL.
THAT SUCKS. I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A SITUATION WHERE I'VE BEEN...
SO SEVERELY DISSED.
I MEAN, AN ORGY IS WHEN
EVERYBODY PARTICIPATES,
NOT FOUR OUT OF FIVE IN THE ROOM.
TO RAELLE:
I AM NOT GOING TO GO
TO SOME SINGLE JEWISH PARTY...
BECAUSE I'M A DISHEVELLED
WRECK OF A SHTICKER...
TO TRY TO MEET
SOME LONG ISLAND JEWESS...
AND LAND ON A FRONT YARD
IN A HOUSE WITH TWO CARS...
AND CHILDREN WHO
BAWL MY NAME...
THROUGH THEIR OWN
SALIVARY GLANDS.
THAT MAY BE YOUR APPROXIMATE
GOAL, BUT THAT IS NOT MINE.
I AM SURPRISED
BY YOUR UNORIGINALITY,
AND I AM TIRED
OF YOUR SILLY EMASCULATIONS.
I WOULD PREFER TO BE
EMASCULATED BY A WOMAN...
WITH MUCH MORE SEVERITY...
AND WITH A LITTLE BIT
MORE BACKBONE.
TO MEM LEVITCH:
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?
I'M TRYING TO LEAD SOMETHING
OF A YOUTHFUL EXISTENCE HERE.
I'M STANDING HERE
ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE TODAY...
TALKING TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...
ABOUT THE MINUSCULE
MOMENTS OF ALIENATION...
THAT I REMEMBER SO WELL
OVER THE LAST QUARTER CENTURY,
AND ALL YOU CAN DO
IS LEAVE MESSAGES ON MY MACHINE...
AND LECTURE ME ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU NEED ME...
UP THERE IN WESTCHESTER.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
CHECK THE AIR IN YOUR TIRES?
YOU NEVER ONCE VAULTED
OUT OF THE GOLDEN CHAIR.
YOU NEVER HAD THE GUTS,
THE AUDACITY,
TO STAND UP AND DO
SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE.
YOU COULD ONLY UTILIZE
YOUR OWN NARCISSISMS...
AND YOUR OWN SELF-ABSORPTION...
TO ALWAYS, IN A TONAL SENSE,
IMPLY TO ME, YOUR CHILD,
THAT I HAD TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.
AND THIS HAS BEEN A DAILY CRUSADE
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF MY BIRTH.
AND WHEN I EMANATED
FROM YOUR BLOODY THIGHS,
IF I'D KNOWN ALL THIS, I'M SURE
I WOULD HAVE CRAWLED BACK IN.
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT
ALL THE MENSTRUATION...
THAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT...
WAS PARTS OF MYSELF LEFT BEHIND
THAT YOU WERE CHOKING TO DEATH?
THAT WAS MY BLOOD!
"WHEN I STOOD ATOP
THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...
"OVERLOOKING
THE BROOKLYN NAVY YARD,
"I FELT SEVERED
FROM HUMANITY,
"FROM THE ACTIVITIES
OF HUMANITY, FROM MAN HIMSELF,
"STARING AT BROOKLYN
AND THEN MANHATTAN.
"IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
WHICH DIRECTION I WALKED IN.
EITHER WAY WAS HELL".
HENRY MILLER,
TROPIC OF CAPRICORN.
AND A GOOD LITERARY DESCRIPTION...
OF A NEW YORK CITY
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
TIMES SQUARE,
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING,
GREENWICH VILLAGE,
STOP AT BLEECKER AND LAGUARDIA,
THROUGH SOHO,
RIGHT ON BROADWAY,
CHINATOWN/SOHO/LITTLE ITALY
STOP. HELLO.
WORLD TRADE CENTERS,
BATTERY PARK,
STATUE OF LIBERTY, OF COURSE,
SOUTH STREET SEAPORT, WALL STREET,
UP THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE
OF CHINATOWN, UP FIRST AVENUE,
DELANCEY AND ALLEN,
ORCHARD STREET FLEA MARKET,
THE UNITED NATIONS,
ACROSS 49th STREET,
THE WALDORF-ASTORIA SHTICK,
PARK AVENUE ON EITHER SIDE
OF YOU, UP MADISON AVENUE,
CENTRAL PARK SOUTH STOP,
DOWN TO ROCKEFELLER CENTER,
BACK TO THE TERMINAL.
THAT'S LIFE.
LIFE--
A CIRCLE WROUGHT
WITH DESTINATIONS.
PEOPLE CONSTANTLY JUMPING OFF THE
BUS AND JUMPING BACK ONTO THE BUS.
SEA LIONS.
NABOBS.
THE CIRCLE.
WHEN YOU CROSS THE STREET
CALLED HOUSTON STREET,
YOU ENTER THE DISTRICT
CALLED SOHO,
WHICH STANDS
FOR "SOUTH OF HOUSTON".
AND AS WE
ENTER SOHO TODAY,
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT...
TO DEDICATE THIS CRUISE
AND THIS ENTRANCE INTO SOHO...
TO OUR DRIVER AND NAVIGATOR
DOWNSTAIRS, BENITEZ.
IN A CERTAIN PERSONAL
DESPAIR TODAY,
I WANT HIM TO KNOW
THAT I AM WITH HIM,
AND I'M BACKING HIM UP ALL THE WAY.
WE'VE DONE
MANY CIRCLES TOGETHER,
AND TOGETHER
WE'VE SUFFERED, AS WE ENTER SOHO.
WE'RE CROSSING HOUSTON STREET
RIGHT NOW. CAN YOU FEEL IT?
BENITEZ,
CAN YOU FEEL IT?
WE'RE ENTERING SOHO.
I WROTE JON A LETTER ABOUT
THE, UH, LAMED VOVNIKS.
UM--
THE, UH-- FROM
THE ANCIENT CABALA.
THIRTY-SIX, UH, IN HEBREW--
LAMED VOVNIK.
I BELIEVE IT MEANS 36.
AND, ESSENTIALLY,
IT DISCUSSES HOW THERE ARE 36
HUMAN BEINGS ON THE PLANET...
AT ALL TIMES-- ONLY 36--
WHO, UH, UPHOLD AND
CREATE THE EQUILIBRIUM...
FOR ALL OF OUR SUFFERINGS.
THEY TAKE THE MALAISE AND
THE MAELSTROM OF PERSECUTIONS...
AND THE DISASTERS OF THE WORLD
ONTO THEIR OWN SHOULDERS,
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE,
THROUGHOUT THEIR
FLESH-PHYSICAL-INCARNATED LIVES.
AND WITHOUT THESE 36 PEOPLE,
THE INFRASTRUCTURE
OF THE WORLD WOULD FALL APART...
AND THERE WOULD BE ARMAGEDDON
AND PERHAPS THE FINAL JUDGMENT,
BUT NOT A PRETTY JUDGMENT,
BY ANY MEANS.
FINAL BUT NOT PRETTY.
MOST OF THE VOVNIKS
DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY'RE VOVNIKS.
THEY SUFFER
IN AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE HELL,
AND THEY SWIM IN AN ENTIRE
WHIRLPOOL OF HUMILITY...
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THEMSELVES OR WHO THEY ARE...
OR THEIR IMPORTANCE
IN THE WORLD.
AND THE VOVNIK MORDECAI,
WHO LEFT THE LARGE FAMILY
OF THE LEVIS...
TO MOVE TO MIERDZBERGZST
ON THE ROCKY GLACIERS OF SILESIA,
UH, IN THE 17th CENTURY,
WHERE THE BAAL SHEM TOV
HAD SET UP CRUISING HEADQUARTERS...
AND INSTITUTED THE BEGINNINGS OF
THE HASIDIM, HASIDIC RELIGION.
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV,
THE ENLIGHTENED RABBI,
PREACHING THE CARNIVOROUSNESS
AND THE RELIGIOSITY IN JOY...
AND THE ECSTASY OF PRAYER.
I MEAN, THE HASIDS ARE NO LONGER
GOING TO SIT WITH PRAYER BOOKS,
YOU KNOW, SILENTLY PRAYING
IN DARKENED SYNAGOGUES.
THEY ARE GOING
TO JUMP AROUND THE ROOM.
THEY ARE GOING TO SCREAM
AND YELL THEIR LOVE FOR GOD.
THEY'RE GOING TO DO CARTWHEELS.
AND MORDECAI WENT THERE
TO HELP CLEAN OUT OUTHOUSES.
BASICALLY, HE WAS A PEASANT
LIVING IN THE TOWN.
DERELICTS AND BUMS AND GENIUSES
AND ARISTOCRATS AND POETS...
AND MEN OF EVERY KIND
OF OCCUPATION AND PHYLUM...
WERE GOING TO MIERDZBERGZST
ON THE ROCKY GLACIERS OF SILESIA...
JUST TO HAVE THEIR OWN MOMENTS
WITH THE BAAL SHEM TOV,
THIS ENLIGHTENED RABBI.
AND MORDECAI REVERENTLY
STOOD IN THE SAME ROOM...
WITH THE BAAL
SHEM TOV A FEW TIMES...
AS HE WENT OFF
TO DO HIS DAILY TOIL.
EVENTUALLY, THEY CALLED HIM
"THE DANCER OF GOD,"
BECAUSE WHEN THE HASIDS WOULD
FORM FOR THEIR REELS OF DANCE...
IN HONOR TO THEIR ECSTASY
TO THEIR GOD,
MORDECAI WOULD JUMP SO HIGH...
AND WOULD DANCE
WITH SUCH AN EXUBERANCE,
THE OTHER HASIDICS WERE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT HIM...
AND FOR HIM,
AND HE WAS EXILED
FROM THE DANCE.
AND SO HE APPEASED HIMSELF
BY DANCING ALONE AT NIGHT...
IN THE SHED RESERVED
FOR THE SICK AND DYING,
AND HE WOULD ENTERTAIN THEM
IN THE EVENINGS ALONE.
SUDDENLY,
THE GAON OF KIEV WHISPERS TO
THE BAAL SHEM TOV ONE DAY...
THAT THERE IS A VOVNIK,
UH, A HOLY, UH, MAN.
THEY HAVE
ANOTHER TERM FOR IT.
A MAN OF TOTAL EQUILIBRIUM,
A LAMED VOVNIK, IN TOWN.
AND SO THEY START SEARCHING
FOR WHO THIS MIGHT BE.
THEY INTERVIEW THE DERELICTS.
THEY INTERVIEW ALL THE PEASANTS.
THEY INTERVIEW THE HANDYMEN.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE GUYS WHO
HANG OUT WITH FARM ANIMALS,
ANYBODY WHO MIGHT
BE MENTALLY RETARDED,
AS MANY VOVNIKS
ARE MENTALLY RETARDED.
SUDDENLY, THEY REALIZE THAT THE
GUY WHO CLEANS THE OUTHOUSES...
DISAPPEARS THE NEXT MORNING.
SUDDENLY,
RUMORS SPREAD AROUND.
THEY SAY TO THE BAAL SHEM TOV, "HE
DANCED FOR THE SICK AT NIGHT ALONE.
HE CLEANED THE OUTHOUSES
CONSCIENTIOUSLY".
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV WOOED
THEM AWAY, PUSHED THEM AWAY,
AND WAS CRYING.
AND THERE WAS SILENCE.
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV
SAID SIMPLY,
"THAT ONE WAS HEALTHY
AMONGST THE SICK,
AND I DID NOT SEE HIM".
- IS THAT OPEN?
- YEAH. THANKS, LARRY.
- HOW YA BEEN?
- ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?
- HANGIN' IN THERE.
- I KNOW THAT FEELIN'.
TODAY'S
MY LAST DAY, MAN. -REALLY?
YEAH. I GOT THE JOB
WORKING WITH TRANSIT.
ALL RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
I START THAT TUESDAY. -ALL RIGHT.
I WAS GONNA
COME IN MONDAY,
BUT AFTER I HEARD
THE WEATHER REPORT, I SAID NO.
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'VE PAID MY DUES.
WELL, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY.
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF CIRCLES.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT
THERE'S A FINISH LINE TO THIS.
I FIND THAT--
I FIND THAT INTERESTING.
THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF LOOKING AT IT,
MAN. -IT'S BEEN SO NICE TO KNOW YOU.
- IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE.
- YEAH, IT'S BEEN A DAMN PLEASURE.
- YEAH, BUT I'LL BE AROUND.
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
PICK UP SOME EXTRA MONEY
FROM TIME TO TIME.
YEAH, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO MUCH MONEY. -THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
AND KEEP IT ALIVE.
244 EAST 49th STREET...
WILL BE A QUIET,
BROWN ROW HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NEXT BLOCK ON YOUR LEFT,
STILL CURRENTLY
THE NEW YORK CITY RESIDENCE...
OF KATHARINE HEPBURN.
GRETA GARBO AND BETTE DAVIS,
WHEN THEY WERE BOTH LIVING,
ALSO HAD RESIDENCES
ON THIS NEXT BLOCK.
WHEN THEY ASKED GRETA GARBO WHY
SHE CHOSE TO LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY,
SHE SAID THAT NEW YORK
WAS THE ONLY PLACE...
WHERE SHE COULD BE... ALONE.
I AM CRUISING CURRENTLY...
RIGHT NOW.
I AM CRUISING BECAUSE
I HAVE DEDICATED MYSELF...
TO ALL THAT IS CREATIVE AND
DESTRUCTIVE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.
AND I'M EQUALLY IN LOVE
WITH EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE...
AND ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT HAVE CAUSED ME TURMOIL...
AND ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT HAVE CAUSED ME GLORY.
I AM THE LIVING WHISPERED WARNING
IN THE ROMAN GENERAL'S EAR,
"GLORY IS FLEETING".
AND IN THAT VERB,
THAT ACTIVE VERB, "FLEETING,"
THERE I LIVE,
THERE I RESIDE IN THIS MOMENT.
I'VE DEDICATED MYSELF
TO THE IDIOM, "I DON'T KNOW".
AND I'M IN LOVE WITH THE FRANTIC
CHAOS OF THIS LIMITLESS UNIVERSE.
I'VE FACED THIS BEFORE.
THE SECOND TO LAST TIME
I TRIED IT, IT DIDN'T GO OFF,
AND I FOUND MYSELF
OVERLOOKING 42nd STREET.
I WAS, LIKE,
EXACTLY 45 FLOORS UP,
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THE CHRYSLER BUILDING.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
THE LAST TIME I TRIED IT,
I STOOD ATOP
THE MARRIOTT MARQUIS HOTEL,
THINKING THAT I HAD
SO GLORIOUSLY ONCE AGAIN EVADED...
THE ANTI-CRUISE
FIRE EXIT SIGNALS...
AND THEN WAS
SUDDENLY SURROUNDED...
BY TWO FIRE DEPARTMENTS PEOPLE,
HEAD OF SECURITY.
LECTURE, REPRIMAND.
I BARELY GOT OUT
OF THERE ALIVE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A KEY BEFORE, THOUGH.
SEEMS TO ME
IT'S THE POTENTIAL OF TURNING IT OFF,
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS ON AND WHAT IS OFF.

I was the nimble joker among my childhood friends.
I have comical quickness in me.
I was born with it.
It wears a cape of delight on her chest
And a veil of fun on her shoulders
You don't get rich doing this.
At least I don't.
Money burns in my pockets.
There isn't much left for my children.
I've told my children - that fond memories of their father is my legacy.
It is beautiful to die but merrier to live
It is merry to wander wide and far
It is beautiful to die but merrier to live
It is merry to wander wide and far
I've mainly focused on my projects - which could have been pretty demanding for my partners.
I haven't always thought about my partners' lives and wishes.
I can admit it now.
For a rascal with no worries
It is merry to sing and bring joy to others and to sing for myself
For a rascal with no worries
It is merry to sing and bring joy to others and to sing for myself
Everyone thinks that women always chase me.
I haven't seen one, damn it.
I've done all the hard work myself.

Let us fill the rift of sorrow

VESKU FR0M FINLAND
I've experienced the beauty of a summer in Lapland - a couple of times, from the beginning to the end.
Poet Eino Leino compares it - to the shortness of human life.
It's hard and harsh but beautiful at its best.
It couldn't be more well said.
This is a wonderful world.
A fucking blast.
In Capri, I met a girl named China
Everyone had told me she was beautiful
She was an ugly tramp.
...beautiful... beautiful...!
Okay, Puppe, collect yourself.
Even lords were mesmerized by her beautiful eyes, but she wanted me
She wanted me
I'm dying laughing.
I can't do this...
Stop making faces.
The moon circles the earth and so do I...
Now my rear end hurts...
Fell on the cobblestones. right on my butt... incredibly painful...
The Co-op Elanto theater.
I feel nostalgic.
This is where it all began.
They had an ad in the Elanto magazine - looking for young, enthusiastic and possibly talented people - for a musical with youngsters.
My brother Pekka and I went to the audition - at the Elanto clubhouse, which was on Kalevantie.
We were chosen.
Then I met Paavo Hukkinen, a location scout, who told me - that Niskanen wanted me to audition - for Jake's role in his film The Boys.
That's the road I'm still on.
Jake!
- What is it, Immu?
There are Germans at the station again.
Jake, wait. I'm coming too.
Six months earlier, my father had borrowed a book from the library.
He asked me if I wanted to read it before he took it back.
The book was The Boys.
"Did you read the book?'' he asked.
"Yes,'' I said.
"It would make a great film.
I'd like to play a role like Jake's.''
Six months later, thanks to the musical I was in, -
I was asked to play the role.
It was unreal.
I was asked to come to the production company office.
The director, cinematographer and location scout were there.
I was almost there.
They were going to make a decision.
Mikko said that in the final scene, -
I would run after a train and my mother would be on the train.
There was a narrow corridor, and the men sat on one side.
I imagined I was running after a train and shouted ''Mother!'' three times.
First time I shouted loud.
The last time I shouted quietly.
Mikko asked me why, as the train was already far away.
I looked at Mikko and said - that Jake has lost hope.
That's when I knew
I had sold myself to Mikko.
Mother! Mother!
Hi, Lily.
Here you are.
Thank you. How pretty.
I'll go get us coffee.
- Great.
My dad never got a chance to study.
He fought in all the wars.
He thought it was important that we'd finish school.
He hoped I would become an engineer. He was an artist himself.
He built great violins, - yet he would've liked his son to become an engineer.
He didn't think I could make a living doing what I do now.
At school,
Vesa-Matti wasn't mischievous - but was always close when others were.
Huopalahti sports field.
This is a dear place to me.
When summer vacation started, -
I would come here four, five times a week.
I'd come here in the morning.
I would count the number of laps when the track was 300 meters, - and run 10 000 meters.
I commentated my run and always won at the end.
I never lost.
Folks, this is very exciting.
10 000 meters at the Olympic Games.
...winning from the very beginning...
...he's fighting...
...he's fighting...
...he takes the gold. He takes the gold...
Dad got tickets to the soccer final between Hungary and Yugoslavia - at the Olympics in Helsinki.
I was six or seven.
I sat behind the goal, with 60 000 people around me.
I didn't know you could have so many people in one place at the same time.
People's admiration was the spark that made me want to entertain.
The goalie blocked the penalty kick, and I realized that was my thing.
As a goalie, I would give myself a nine or a ten.
That was my first calling.
We boxed at the community hall.
The team was called Haagan Haka.
They started calling me Vessa-Matti, vessa meaning toilet, - but I managed to change it to Vesku.
We had fist fights and pushed and shoved each other - and I've been called Vesku ever since.
Music came into the picture early on.
I would sing with the boys before we went out to play.
They had quite good voices, and we'd sing all kinds of songs.
I used to listen to Billie Holiday and remember thinking, -
I wish I could just find my own sound.
I wouldn't ask for anything else.
My grades were really good up until the third grade.
And that's the grade I got stuck in.
I became interested in art - and experienced the exhilariting feeling of discovering the opposite sex.
If I'm totally honest,
I've worked this hard - and invested so much in this - so that I could only get laid easier.
This is better when it comes to proportions.
You can use a measure to get the proportions are right.
Your drawing is a bit...
The neck is a bit misshaped.
The head is a bit too big.
You might want to erase it.
Use a light stroke.
That looks like a newborn child.
Draw the arm again.
When we were filming, -
Mikko said I should apply to the Theatre Academy.
I'd already thought about it myself.
Mikko coached me.
I went to the exams and read in the paper that I'd been accepted.
In the 30s, they founded the Academic Karelia Society here.
30 years later, we had the premiere ofLapualaisooppera.
It was intuitive and paradoxical.
Young people sang about nonviolence, - yet Vesku was known for his fists already in the 60s.
He was quick to react. Sometimes he would have his arm in a cast - but he would still sing about nonviolence.
REHEARSAL
God damn it!
On these plains, God damn it, we do not blaspheme God!
Our northern fatherland can only be saved by Ostrobothnia
Hi!
- Hello!
My hall.
- Right.
"God damn it! On these plains..."
A critic wrote that a skinny milksop shouts:
"God damn it, on these plains.''
But you believed in me, in my energy.
It could be a milksop.
Or anybody anywhere.
The opening song was crucial.
The question was, who could do it?
Your voice and body language were just right.
Coming out from the depths to the front of the stage and all...
You had it in you, - as an athlete, musician and actor.
When would a Finn be happier
Than when he lives in his own cottage
When would a Finnish woman rejoice more
Than when she takes care of her own kitchen
Finns love to work, indeed
Finns will pay the price, indeed
Finns will take anything, indeed
If they can make a living on their own
We wanted to be in the spotlight.
We wanted to tell stories.
So others gave us the content.
- They gave us content all the time.
This was new stuff when we were active.
We held an Independence Day party - for alcoholics, homeless people and the so-called winos - at the Student House next door.
Why do so many of our men die in vain?
Men full of hope, full of ideals
Men full of fire too soon wane
They all die, grow weary too early
Elsewhere the gray-haired are full of fire
Their souls glowing and brave
Our boys are born ready to retire
And young men are ripe for grave
We did Porvaritanssit, a play, and you fell. - I wanted to fall - on my face here.
I knew it would be possible.
I put a bag of blood in my mouth.
I remember falling on my ass after the last somersault.
I jumped and bit the bag.
It almost hit the people in the first row.
Aarre Elo saw it - and wanted to create
The Finnish Championships in falling.
I'm sure you all know my next guest.
Welcome!
This is Vesku Loiri.
What fun could we come up with?
How about we start hitting each other?
Hitting each other? Why?
We'd give the media something to write about.
Not a bad idea.
But which one of us starts?
Me?
- Because it was your idea?
I'm the father of the idea.
- True. Go ahead.
With insults?
- Sure.
Pig.
- What? - Pig.
Pig? That's what I was going to say.
- Say something else.
I can't come up with anything.
- Otter.
Okay, we'll leave it at that.
That was fun, indeed.
I started doing comedy, - and it started to take more and more of my time - outside theater.
I did a lot of comedy for TV, - a series called jatkoaika, for example.
The older actors warned me and said - that people expected me to become a...
They said that my dramatic insight was too good - for doing nonsense like that.
Pertti "Spede'' Pasanen, is that you?
What's up?
- Hello.
Mrs. Pasanen, right? Hello.
You realize how great...
That TV thing must be difficult.
It's okay, thanks.
You've got some funny stuff coming up? - Sure...
Having a night off?
- Yes. Thanks for your visit.
In some interviews, -
I've said that comedians are pretty nasty men, and women - and that they have a short fuse.
You remember me?
I was thinking if you could...
Can you come over to our table?
There is a lady who is a big fan.
I want to sit here.
- Should we move to your table?
It's an insult, - when you're invited to a party, for example, - and you suddenly realize - that people are expecting you to entertain them.
I'll toast to Spede!
- Can you please...
You're a man of the people.
And your wife, too.
Yes, my wife is, too.
- Have some.
People expect comedians to be funny even in private.
That's why many comedians are pretty angry and sulk.
They think, -
''Don't you come and ask for a joke, or I'll...''
Are you too good for my drink?
- No.
You're a real star now?
It's gone to your head?
It's not that.
Your colleague Simo is ten times better. Stay out of the TV screen.
We used to prepare for writing the scripts at a hotel in Hyvinkää.
We would stay there for a week - before we actually began to write.
We'd discuss ideas.
Pertti wanted to go to the night clubs, but it was really difficult.
I've been in bars and among people a lot and...
I've learned how to get rid of people who want to bother you - without hurting anybody's feelings.
Is your wife in the toilet?
- She went home, thanks to you.
I would've asked her for a dance.
- She doesn't dance.
Listen, are you going to do your show or not?
For the last time, go back to your table. - Don't start with me.
I've fought tougher guys than you.
Pertti had a short fuse.
I often told him to control himself, - or he'd find himself in the tabloids for punching somebody.
Instead, he would stomp on the person's foot.
His first glass downed
She brought another round
When the loveliest girl took a chance
My name is Tamara
It won't harm ya
If you'd come with me and dance
Ay caramba, that's when samba full of rhythm, was in fashion
Get on your feet, old troll
I want to show you the steps
Right before the last call, a guy came up to me and asked, -
"Loiri, do you want to come and do a gig?"
"What do you mean?'' I asked.
"At my house,'' he said.
"No, it's bedtime,'' I said.
''Is it about money?'' he asked.
"No, it's because it's almost three in the morning,'' I said.
"And who would I perform to?''
"To my wife,'' he said.
"It would be so nice since she doesn't go out that much,'' he said.
I said, ''No way."
He offered me a thousand marks.
I said it wasn't enough.
He offered two thousand.
When he got to five thousand,
I said yes.
And we left.
Jomi Limmonen came with me.
The man gave us drinks and asked us to wait.
Jomi never drank, but I had one.
Then he went to wake his wife up.
She came out in a nightgown, with rollers in her hair.
"Vesa-Matti Loiri, and I look like this!''
And she started to cry.
''What are you doing here?''
"I'm going to do a gig,'' I said.
I said, ''Please sit down."
She sat there in culture shock.
I sang "Nocturne" and...
No, I don't think it was ''Nocturne.''
I sang another love song and ''Fateful Samba.''
She cried, and I did a couple of somersaults for her.
That's a comedian's life.
...a product people put in their hairs - when they want to look completely well-groomed.
Oh, shaving foam.
Here.
A product people put in their hair...
Oh, shampoo.
Here you are.
- I suppose that's what it is.
One, two, to the side, feet together.
One, two, to the side, feet together.
Oh my, I feel like I took the lead for a moment.
Alright. One, two, to the side and feet together.
Oh no, now it's falling apart.
I must look pretty smart since everybody's looking.
Almost everybody.
But you get sweaty doing this.
Both Pertti and Vesku were stubborn.
If Vesku thinks there's a better way to do something, he'll say so.
That's how their arguments started.
They never fought over money.
Pertti appreciated Vesku's work and paid him well.
The trouble with the tax office was Vesku's own fault.
If you tell them to count your receipts, the tax office will remember.
Are you afraid
I will find your money stash?
We have a torture department in the tax office.
We'll find out.
I'm sure there is money everywhere.
There's no money at all.
The tax office has taken it all.
You're telling jokes so that
I wouldn't search your house, right?
It won't help. I'll look everywhere.
No!
- Uh-huh, I think we found the stash.
If one thinks of Leino's poems, for example, "It Still Beats Proud'' or -
"On a road, a man with no address, no cattle...''
I had huge tax debts.
It was easy to identify with the poem.
"A free ride to prison might be too much for him''
"As he has no fatherland, home village or kin''
It is such a fine poem.
Tavastia rock music club was packed.
The backstage was full of friends and people wanted to congratulate me.
The bouncer came and said a guy named Hietanen wanted to see me.
I made those songs in the summer of 1 977.
I had heard Vesku sing
"Summer of Lapland'' and ''Nocturne."
They were composed by Chydenius.
I thought Vesku was the only person who could sing my songs.
He is so undeniably credible.
I've read a lot of Eino Leino ever since I was little.
The atmosphere after the gig was so good - that I ventured backstage to give him a tape of my songs.
I thanked you and you left.
I set the tapes here, and you called me a couple of days later.
You said you'd given me a collection of songs, - and wondered what I thought of them.
I thought, God dammit, I'd forgotten.
I told you a white lie - and asked you to call me the next day.
It was during the day and I had to find the bouncer.
We came here and found the tapes.
Had you not found them, I might have forgotten about the whole thing.
Really?
- It's possible.
It's possible that they'd have never been recorded.
Great.
I'm not afraid anymore
The night is done
The ravings of a lunatic no longer torture me
I'm full of life, sorrow is gone
Flowers, hills and the sky I see as before
Like a surging flood
Heavy waves of blood
I feel I have the power to move mountains and then
My thoughts carry me and I can dream again
With a hand on my heart
I say out loud
To the world, to the defeated victor:
It still beats proud!
People warned me about doing comedy.
The world of entertainment was seen as cheap.
There would be no return. They said
I'd get hurt and lose myself.
I never believed it.
And through my Eino Leino records
I could prove them wrong.
Bring me a mountain from Lapland
And beneath it bury my heart
It will still beat beneath the sand
You will feel the earth's trembling start
Tread on it, and it will prick your toe
Freeze it, and in ice, its flowers grow
Chain it, and its chains will break
Capture it, and its captors it will take
In its rocky arches a song of triumph chimes
It is forever free, embracing new times
It still beats proud!
To cut the dear thread of life
I know death comes this way
Cold and pale tomorrow
Is a strong, lusty man today
Rest under ground, arms full of earth
But over grave, over death
Comes freedom to which his dear heart once beat
It is alive and breathes even beneath the heavy ground
On autumn nights its flame can sear
What people do the tyrants fear
It still beats proud!
It beats
I experience every song like a small play.
Sometimes I sing about something or somebody as Vesa-Matti Loiri.
But it's rare.
More often I take a role - and become the person singing about what he sees.
A boat is carried by the tide
What awaits us at the end of the ride?
Sins so dark loom over us
Man glows like a brief spark
Then the hearth turns dark
Only a handful of ash remains
Sins grow and new ones begin
Sons are born with their fathers'sins
Bosom full of chaff and stains
What awaits us at the end of the ride?
A boat is carried by the tide
The whole world rocks in these quarters
So limitless is the sea!
Please hurry
The clouds are mirrored in my quiet waters
It is time to sleep, powerful God
And lay your white-haired head to rest
Look how the shadows of death grow shorter
Oh, I'm sorry. I almost bumped
Into you. - Bumped into me?
Yes.
- Oh, please do it. Bump into me.
Oh, no. - Please. I love bumping into people. In this case, I demand it.
In that case,
I'll bump into you just a little.
When Vesku was young, he had no trouble getting women.
Women would push themselves on him.
Sometimes I felt embarrassed for them.
He is famous and multi-talented.
They didn't know him, - yet they were ready to give themselves to him.
What man wouldn't like that?
I could see his crooked smile.
Can you see how popular I am?
I'm getting back my taste for women.
Butler, bring me more!
What? - Here we have a sample.
They could be younger, though.
You want a particular color?
- We'll take the whole spectrum.
You said I gave you a weak kiss, like an old man. - 0h my God!
Let's do it properly on the pool table. - Here?
Well no, I bet you're wearing pantyhose. - Really?
I'm glad you came.
I agreed to write a series of interviews for Jaana magazine.
Naturally, I contacted Vesa-Matti Loiri and asked for an interview.
We did it at the Helsinki City Theatre - and I wanted to penetrate his brain.
I could feel a strong presence and I understood - that something strange was about to happen.
I looked up and saw Loiri but didn't know it was him.
I felt an emotional connection.
I had found a soul mate.
I had to get up and follow him.
These are mysterious things.
Someone just feels familiar to you.
Meeting a familiar soul - and remembering something in the past.
Or as if remembering.
Our conversations went on day and night, for weeks.
He let me, not only into his brain, - but into his world.
We had this incredible instant chemistry. Like in the movies.
I could see his personality, his soul.
We went home together and talked the whole night.
Vesku told me all about his life, and a little more.
A man opening his world and saying -
"You understand, come with me" - is the greatest possible declaration of love for me.
He'll do anything for the ones close to him.
He'll surrender himself, both at work and in relationships.
Our relationship was very intense.
Around the world, once or twice. Bye!
Vesku is a night owl, and so am I.
We lost the daily rhythm - and didn't know much about what was happening outside.
My blinds would be drawn for three days in a row.
I would come home from work at 4 PM - and he would be waking up.
I couldn't handle it anymore.
I had to choose.
Our love felt so strong that I had to see where it would take us.
I enjoyed it so much that I quit my day job.
But I did modeling on the side.
What is it?
- Lips, don't. No.
What?
- I want to get rid of a reflex.
What reflex? - You see, my eyes inform my brain - that the most beautiful woman in the world is nearby.
My nostrils inform my brain - that the most beautiful woman in the world smells lovely.
My lips take a most passionate kissing position, - and my head starts moving my lips towards her lips.
The chemistry between us was too much for some people.
It was touching to see how they tried to break it.
But they couldn't.
We got bullshit from the media - and even from people close to us.
Age was never a factor.
We had a 23-year age difference, but it wasn't a problem for us.
We felt we knew each other from before.
The media attack was so mean that I had to leave the country.
"As you can see, I've moved out.''
"I won't say where.''
"My lawyers will contact you.
Your ex-wife Elisabeth.''
This is so wrong.
Every time I believed this is it.
Something big and eternal.
And it can be something big, even if it didn't last.
We quickly moved in together.
I had just occupied a building.
I think Vesku was attracted to my anarchy and my survival instincts.
I wanted to find a place in the country - so we looked for one together.
We drove around in a Mini Morris and looked for a den.
They have all been eternal for me.
Every time I thought that this is it.
It's naïve and stupid.
People must have said,
"There he goes again."
But I believed in it myself.
I wanted to.
But I'm sure I'm not the easiest partner one can have.
I've marked all the spots that are sore and tender - with scotch tape.
I'll explain the figure.
Red tape: sore spots.
Blue tape: sensitive spots.
White tape: tender spots.
This way I'll find the right medicine.
I poke my finger in a spot.
I compare that to this figure.
It says ''tender spot.''
Then I'll take the right medicine.
It works.
We moved to the country together.
I ended up staying here - and Vesku moved back into the city.
We once said in an interiew that it's strange we're not married.
We are so similar in some aspects, - that we'd fight all the time if we were a married couple.
I've had a number of daughters-in-law.
Pekka had only one woman, but Vesku had more.
The girls were...
If I had told them - that Vesku is an artist...
He doesn't go to work at eight - and come back at four.
You have to understand that.
But the girls were enthusiastic.
Nothing I said would have helped.
But then they ended up fighting over Vesku's lifestyle.
"Loitering''? So it's called loitering when a man sacrifices his sleep - and slaves away to support his family.
I don't understand a word you're saying. Tell me where you've been!
I was looking for a job.
- Ajob...
What job do you look for at night?
- A night watchman's job.
He can be a bit lazy sometimes, but not when it comes to work.
He works really hard.
Home is for relaxing.
First of all, just lying here,
I pump eight liters of blood a minute.
My heart beats 100 times a minute.
1 50, if I move a little.
My liver produces tens, if not thousands, of enzymes, - needed for different vital functions.
At the same time, I breathe, - and my lungs produce oxygen from dirt and pollution - and my kidneys use the oxygen for producing red blood cells.
I need red blood cells.
I can't live without them.
Millions of things happen in me, and you say I do nothing.
I'm not adds with them, but my relationships often ended in strife.
Fine. We'll get a divorce if that's what you want.
May this be the reward for having slaved away at your side.
Thank God that I didn't made more money for us to fight over.
Shut up.
It was inevitable, but it was also bitter.
It was bitter every time and...
...then after some time, a relief.
I was young when I became a mother for the first time, 21 years.
There were a lot of poop diapers.
We had two little boys, two mini-Uunos.
Time flew when we admired them.
There was a lot going on.
And still is.
He was good with the children - and a little childish, too.
He played with them.
What shall we play today?
How about hide-and-seek again?
No! - Yesterday we looked for you the whole day.
Come here, you little critter.
Uncle Nasse will go into an easy hiding place. Count to 5000.
Start counting. Hands over your eyes.
One, two... - Two more!
- Three...
He was no Uuno Turhapuro for us, but he's a child at heart.
He'd come up with things ordinary dads don't.
He isn't a good dad in a traditional way, - but in his way he's just great.
My children are very important to me.
Jenni and Joonas are grownups, but still.
Ukko and Sampo are young men.
It's great to be able to follow their lives up close.
He's the best dad ever.
We love him so much.
He's really reliable. A good guy.
When I was young,
I became angry at the tabloids.
Everybody knew about the divorce and other personal things - that might have been painful.
The divorce was tough.
I had no contact whatsoever with Jenni and Joonas.
No contact at all.
When I was eighteen, we stopped talking.
We didn't talk for six years.
I left and the kids stayed with their mom.
Dads are often blamed in a situation like this.
It was a quiet man's revenge.
I wanted to call but couldn't.
It just happened.
We traveled to Amsterdam together and had a straight talk.
A friend told us to go on a cruise - and not come back until we were friends again.
Everything was clear after two hours.
It was damn cool to be able to talk, - to be able to forgive and be forgiven.
We're both stubborn and couldn't admit it to each other. Now we have.
I'm very happy.
I have four children who clearly love me - and who I love more than anything.
Jankku, my fifth child died in a car accident at 21 .
Vesa-Matti was in Spain when he got the information.
He had to find a way to come home.
He got a plane ticket and got a seat - with a wall in front of him.
He said he cried the whole flight.
Vesku has had a lot of good in his life - and he has gotten many rewards, - but as he sings, a singer's ransom is high...
Losing both his wife and his son in car accidents - must have been the hardest.
And all Vesku's marriages ended in divorce.
But I don't think - he sees the divorces and the ends of his relationships as tragedies.
He has gotten a lot from these people and has also given a lot.
But losing loved ones has been tough.
I've tried to be there for him, - but there are no words for this.
I can still remember the oldTornator when
You stepped on board, my dear old friend
You left school and I wanted to come with you
My parents told me to stay at home
Standing on the pier
I watched you sail out to sea
We were both fifteen
You took a stand
You took your life in your hands
You experienced it all
I could only dream of it in vain
An albatross gliding without rest might be
Akin to your soul, it's not your fault
In the blue sky you may soar free
My dear old friend, an old salt
My dear old friend, an old salt
You wanted to see me.
- Please sit down.
Oh, down, indeed.
But of course I will if you want, sir.
I did walk the length of the hallway, after all.
Let me get straight to the point.
You were hired on a two-month probationary basis.
Unfortunately those two months are over. - Oh my.
How time flies.
Has it really been two months?
I would almost say it's a lie if I didn't hear it from you.
Try to see it from my point of view.
What would you do in my place?
Oh, now I understand.
I appreciate it, sir.
What would I do in your place?
An honest answer to an honest question.
Nose surgery.
That's what I would do.
My marriage to Pertti was a strange relationship.
A good relationship.
I got kicked by a horse
Oh, how it hurt and caused me so much pain
I got kicked
I got kicked out by my boss
Oh, how good it felt
I got so much more free time
I got kicked
Vesku has never tolerated authority.
Pertti and Vesku had a love-hate relationship.
They needed each other, but they did know how to fight.
There are things
I would've wanted to do - but couldn't because of Turhapuro and Spede's films.
If I'm honest, Spede didn't like me doing these things.
He thought it should've been enough for me - to do what we mastered in this country.
But it was never enough for me.
InSeven Brothers, - we could've been fighting and envying one another.
We've always had our separate territories. - That's right.
Each has his own territory.
There has never been any rivalry.
I felt a need to do long-term work as an actor.
I still miss it, as I've done so little theater.
I had a contract with a theater for six years - and appeared as a guest in a few roles.
In Seven Brothers, he played Tuomas who is solid as an old oak.
He did a really good job, - but sometimes he wanted to amuse the others by hitting on Aapo.
The audience didn't see it, but you had a pipe in his mouth and...
Hessu Kinnunen laughed so easily...
- He had to leave the stage.
Vesku won't come to a rehearsal at 1 1 AM and finish at 3 PM - and then come back in the evening.
That's not what he wants.
If we do a film, he'll be there on time, - but the rhythm in theater doesn't suit him.
He wants to be free and choose his projects.
Spede often talked about artsy fartsy, - which for him often meant anything except his own work.
But he knew well what was good and what wasn't.
I would say he was quite selfish - and wanted to keep his crew together.
It was like whoring...
Welcome, my wife made of gold.
Kind-hearted.
Gentle.
Handmade.
The way I like her.
The way I want her.
And The Iron Age, God damn...
- We didn't know what we got into!
Kalevi came and woke me up.
He asked me to make Sampo.
He came and woke Ilmari up whose golden woman had rusted.
A robot is a robot.
Kalevi would slap me in the face, - and I could see you didn't exactly like it.
I told him to slap me harder, since I was a boxer.
He couldn't because we were good friends.
I said,
"C'mon. You slap like a faggot.''
Wake up! - Then he hit me and I broke my tooth.
We did a retake.
I felt like I had sand in my mouth.
Building Sampo took a long time.
It took months - because we had to make it clear for ourselves what it was.
Enska Suominen and his men built it.
They drew sketches and time flew.
It got on our nerves, and one time when we were out in a bar, -
Vesku punched a table or something.
He completely smashed his hand.
Our worlds became distorted at one point or another.
I'm the Ping-Pong champion at Lapinlahti mental hospital.
It wasn't easy. We played the first matches outside in the wind.
In the finals, you could play against the doctor in the hallway.
That match I couldn't lose.
That's how mad I am.
I.
I myself.
While sleeping, especially if you're having nightmares, - your dreams can be so artistic.
A complicated, realistic world.
Not even Tolstoy was able to come up with something like that.
Yet these dreams are not dreamed by writers, but by ordinary people.
Officials, penmen, priests.
First you try to make me believe that you are real.
That you exist.
And now you are assuring me that you arejust a dream.
We're all a little confused, thanks to your science.
Yesterday I laughed with the staff at an office.
They didn't want to print my story.
I said believing in God in our times is reactionary, - but that I'm the Devil.
You can believe in me.
They didn't.
At times, it took a toll on my mental health.
Yes, Dostoyevsky is full of mines if you start digging.
People often say it's naive - when actors say they've been trapped in a role.
It's not naive.
It's a terrible trap. - Your mind works on the role all the time.
You react the way your character would. - Exactly.
I went through a rough phase in one of my marriages because of a role.
Like my character,
I became an anarchist.
Vesku loves people.
He's gone through a lot, including sorrow and losing loved ones.
Vesku wants to give all he can when he's on stage.
But he has his moments of hatred and bitterness.
When he drank, things would sometimes escalate - and he'd punch someone like Frederik, the singer, in the face or something.
Straight, only. Straight, straight.
The straights will break him.
I know why you're back.
- I started seeing the world in color.
You want your revenge from yourself.
You want one tough match more.
- Why do you say that?
I happen to know that's how it is.
- Will you be in my corner if I do that?
Of course.
Otherwise you'd get your ass kicked.
Purtsi told me to come and train.
There was no mention of matches.
Then he said, ''You have a match in Lahti in two weeks.''
Fucking hell, I thought.
I could tell you were nervous when you got into the ring.
But it was great.
- It was a tough spot.
You were already famous in Finland, - and it would be tough for anyone to step into the ring, - even if it was just to train.
It's tough.
But you rushed into the ring and gave it your all.
I boxed in the 75+kg class. - I'd say you'd have to lose some weight.
At my worst, I weighed 140 kg.
- Really?
My diabetes has messed everything up.
I didn't drink at all last summer.
I didn't lose a gram.
I've been real mad at you.
You were in top shape.
But then you started slipping.
If you lost a hundred grams a day.
It's not much, is it? - No...
How much would it be in a year?
- Well...
36 kilos.
How much would it be in ten years?
430 kilos. You'd lose yourself.
I started losing my sense of balance, since I'd lost sensation in my feet.
At this moment, I can't accept a film role if I have to walk in it.
That's the hard truth. But I don't see this as something permanent, - even though it might be.
I have to exercise, no matter how hard it is.
I think I might start tomorrow.
Or the day after tomorrow, depending on the weather.
It might rain, so let's say in a couple days.
Next week.
I promise I'll start next week.
In Lapland, everything quickly blooms
The ground, the grass, barley, and more
In my mind this thought often looms when I look at what our people have had to endure
Why does nothing here of beauty remain and loftier things are grounded?
To so many people sanity bids adieu
And those who can pluck the kantele are so few
Elsewhere the gray-haired are full of fire
Their souls glowing and brave
Our boys are born ready to retire
And young men are ripe for grave
And myself? Why do I sit and brood?
It is a sign of early old age.
Why don't I follow what's in my blood?
Instead I'm resigned to their fate at this stage
I'm so superstitious that if I haven't caught any fish, -
I know I have to sing
"Summer of Lapland'', - with great emotion.
Maiden Inari, or do you call a lake a Miss, or is it a Mrs.?
It's a she anyway.
A pretty tough chick.
You have to sing with emotion.
You can't force it.
Then you'll get fish.
I think I forced it, since I'm not getting any fish.
For the first time in a long time, -
I'm singing material that was made for me.
In a way, this was also made for you. It is a wedding waltz - and I made it for my daughter and my son-in-law.
We knew already then, - that my son-in-law was sick and might not have much time left.
There is some pain in it...
- A black spot.
Pain in the sound.
Back in 1997,
I wanted to give this song to you.
I thought it would be your song.
Bog star, if I a mirky haze has filled your eyes with fear
I will protect the sparkle in your gaze
I will kiss away each tear
This glowing moment filled with bliss will never fade, it's true
Forever in your arms like this,
I will always love you
I will always love you
They used the word "perfect'' here.
- Okay, let's get going then.
Hi.
- Hi.
I have to have a smoke.
How's it going?
- I'm getting there...
Terrible drugs, totally Zen Buddhist.
It's nice to get on the road.
I have a stamp on my forehead.
Everyone has an opinion of me.
It was getting hard for me to go out.
I would see people in the street, but I would look away.
I thought it wasn't normal. since I didn't have a bad conscience or anything.
I was walking on Mannerheimintie - and decided that I would look everyone in the eye and smile - and then turn and look again and smile.
It felt good, but I noticed that some people were offended.
Especially when I turned and looked again.
They'd mumble,
"What the hell is he doing?''
Even though they had started it.
"Look, it's him.''
Some people started laughing when I turned and looked again.
They understood what it was about.
I was just testing my limits.
You know you've done a lot of shit, too.
You can never tell what someone has seen.
If he's seen the shit.
Whenever you're ready.
- Alright.
Good afternoon, Provinssirock!
YleX radio station is delighted and honored - to welcome to the stage a man who has made great music.
Are you ready? Great.
Ladies and gentlemen, -
Vesa-Matti Loiri!
Finally.
Moss and bark can grow on one's heart
They don't preach love
They just play their part
Healthy selfishness will give everything away
The stupidity of followers do it just for display
Does it matter where their nights are spent
Love is their calling
They're not discontent
What kind of fate is held in store for a good man or woman
Whose profession is amour
To a hardened heart their love can bring
The people they tend love's cruel sting
Their cruelty and scorn always prevails
Their wrists and ankles will be pierced by nails
Does it matter where their nights are spent
Love is their calling
They're not discontent
What kind of fate is held in store for a good man or woman
Whose profession is amour
Thank you.
It's been wonderful to be here and perform for you.
You can't imagine how good it feels.
Thank you. Take care.
My mother asked me at one point - if I ever mourned Jankku's death.
I asked her if she felt I hadn't.
After that, my mother understood that I just don't show it.
When someone leaves this world in the wrong order, - when a twenty-year-old dies, your child dies, - it's something you can never overcome. You can't understand it.
On the other hand...
What can we do?
I miss Jankku.
He enjoyed being here.
We used to come here a lot, especially in the winter.
We'd ice fish. We were freezing, - but Jankku could've fished for hours.
Memories of him here are very vivid.
You'll never forget it...
...but you can't get stuck in it either.
A number of our presidents used to visit Aino Kassinen.
She was the state clairvoyant.
Aino was my teacher, my Zen master.
We meditated and visited all kinds of worlds.
She always warned me and said - that I shouldn't touch anything there.
As an adult, I had tried to levitate through meditation, - but hadn't succeeded.
But then it happened.
I saw a fine cape made of stars behind me - and landed on the floor like a ski jumper - and went straight through.
I looked at the fire station - across the street from the apartment below.
I saw a broken-winged sparrow.
It was hobbling on the floor.
Even though
I knew I shouldn't touch it, -
I took it in my hand.
It bit in my fingers and transformed itself - into some sort of a leather frog.
I tried to shake it off, but it just got bigger and bigger.
I finally managed to shake it off.
Many things I saw then - happened later in real life.
My son Jankku was five years old at the time.
The strangest thing was when I went home three days later, -
Jankku opened the door and said:
That frog that bit Dad was weird.
We had experienced it together.
Like I said, -
I can fool some people, but I can't fool myself any longer.
It feels, after all, quite good.
I've always been able to be alone.
Loneliness and being alone are two completely different things.
Besides, here you are never alone.
You'll see a Siberian jay or a wolf.
I once saw a wolf in front of the house.
I was about to put a trash bag next to the porch steps, - when I heard the tapping of paws.
I said, ''Whose little...''
I didn't say the word ''dog.''
A wolf was standing five meters from me. We looked at each other, - and it turned away and started running south.
It trotted in the same rhythm as it had trotted here.
The sentence changed to
"Whose little wolf you are?''
It was a fine encounter.
It is a proud animal.
It wasn't afraid, it didn't startle.
There was nothing threatening.
It probably saw me as an extension to the trash bag.
Dammit, I'll prove to you -
I'm more than an extension to the trash bag!
I had the premiere, first and second division games ahead of me - when I got a damn good pass and started running.
The defense was behind me.
I turned to see how close.
And then, a crash.
The goalie from the other team hit me sideways.
My foot got caught under him.
The snap was incredibly loud.
Both bones between the knee and the ankle broke.
It's a loud snap.
Later I heard - that I was almost brain dead for a couple of minutes.
I remember the stretchers being put on wheels.
I lost consciousness in the elevator.
When I woke up,
I was lying on top of a brick wall.
There was a beautiful meadow sloping down on each side.
The slope was gentle, so I wouldn't get bruises if I fell off the bed.
I was on this side, so I knew I couldn't fall.
This was the so-called death side, and I wanted to go there.
The life of Vesa-Matti Loiri would continue on the other side.
I was so damn tired of being Vesa-Matti Loiri - that I wanted to go to the death side.
I spent five days in the oxygen tent...
...in intensive care.
When I was ready to roll over to the death side, -
I had a dialogue.
I can't say I heard a particular voice, but I heard a question.
"You know you can go to that side.''
''The life of Vesa-Matti Loiri will end, - but life goes on.''
"As you might know, there are no limits.''
"You really think you can go there?"
"You think you have accomplished your mission?''
That feeling of shame. Fuck...
I quickly rolled over to the other side.
I sat up. The tubes came out.
A nurse came and asked me if I'd recovered.
Yes, I've recovered.
That's when I started - being actively aware.
I've been lucky to have met mentors and...
All my life I've been a smith with these hands.
I forged a woman when my woman died.
I made her myself.
And I made Sampo.
With these hands!
With these hands!
Was this all?
Life.
It wasn't much.
I forged myself into a poor man.
I forged myself.
I've always done the impossible.
I've said, ''I think it will work out.''
It won't work out.
Nothing will.
Never.
I wouldn't try again.
I would live another life.
No, I don't believe it.
I would do it all over again.
I couldn't come up with another life for myself.
You can't make your own life.
It makes you.

Come on with you.
The net is gone to the devil.
It's torn to pieces.
Oh, never mind, Colin.
I showed the ween what to do.
We have nothing left but the cots.
You got a great drenching, Michaelin, didn't you?
By God, I never saw the sea so!
Pick yourself up, Michael.
Let's pull ourselves together.
I'm doing my best, aren't I?
Eh, leave him alone, Colin.
Lift up that net. Lift it up.
It is caught there on that rock.
It is there, Colin.
Lift it up.
We have it. We have it.
We're all right now.
We are, thank God.
That's it. Now, go on, Maggie.
A little bit more.
That'll do now.
- That's good now.
- You're fine and strong. God bless you.
Well, I thought I was going to get drowned that time but I wasn't.
I'm sorry I got you by the hair.
But I didn't want to lose you.
It isn't as though you're about to lose me, Colin.
Go on.
Go on.
If it's like this tomorrow, we should have enough.
Well, if we'd have five or six loads more we ought to have enough.
Not quite.
I'd say we'd want ten loads more.
- As much as that?
- Yes.
Are you going to put the seaweed out tonight?
We'll do our best.
We'll put some of it out.
- Go on!
- Oh, look!
Look, I'm drenched.
Go on.
Go on!
Go on.
Up.
Up with you.
There's much more down there, Patch.
A couple of baskets more.
Let us lift. Go on.
Good boy, Mike. Good boy.
Drop her down.
Good man, Patch. Good man.
- Haul it up, Mike.
- Haul it up.
Haul her up.
Come on, then. Hup.
Haul her up.
- Keep it going.
- We are, Patch.
Listen, if it's too heavy for ye...
Up with it.
Up she goes.
Up she goes.
The sooner we're out, the better.
There's a lot of them there, though.
There is, and they're heading in, too.
Look at them.
Come on.
- Did you strike him under the fin?
- Aye, I did.
Mind your back.
We stand a good chance now, so...
- Hang on now, boy. Hang on.
- Handle her carefully now.
Give him plenty clear.
Give it to me.
Get the harpoon out.
When do I turn her?
Nothing out.
I think we stand a good chance.
Handle him. Handle him!
Grab me a line.
Check him, boys.
Take him with this.
Watch that line now. Watch the line.
- Make a lot of room for him.
- Careful now.
The boat's in line there now.
Stand clear of the line.
Stand clear of the line there now.
You'll go over the side if that catches you. Stand clear there.
Stand clear. Let it out.
Stand clear. Stand clear.
Steady now. Steady now.
Hang on. Hang on to him. Hang on.
He's in a bad way there, now.
Most of your rope. Lower the rope out.
And draw your line forward over the bollard again. This line goes there.
Now, boys!
- Careful, now.
- Hold him now.
- Tiger's over.
- He's not.
Stand clear of the line, will you?
- Come on, then.
- Move your leg.
Clear below, Patch.
Steady, now. Steady.
Don't cut it yet.
Don't cut it yet, Patch.
Take her down.
I got it! I got it!
- Haul it in. Haul it in again. Come on.
- Grab the knot.
Terrible big monster on that.
The way he pulled that.
Well, they have thundering strength to them.
Look at how twisted it is.
Easy now. Slack up that line to me.
It's all slack. It's all slack.
Wheel her around.
- Back water, Tommy.
- All right. All right.
He's a master of that fellow.
A bigger fellow in front of you there.
Get ready for him.
Hey, hey! Hold on to him!
Hold on to him!
Come on, Michaelin.
- Do you think they'll get it?
- Sure they will.
- Keep her head up, Patch.
- Right ahead.
- Direach sin.
- All right. Don't be shouting too high.
Right. Don't splash me. Don't splash.
All right. Steady, boy. Steady.
All ready.
Careful now.
- Careful now.
- Hang on a minute.
Bring the bow on to him.
A good throw. Hit him!
Strike it out! Strike out!
Here's the rope. Clear the line!
Yes.
Clear the line.
Clear the line.
I've got a second turn on it.
Give him line. Give him line.
Slash away. Slash away.
There he is. He's going.
Close him down.
Try and hold him.
Close him down.
Well, he's on the bottom now.
Well, I hope that this...
Row her out.
Pull.
Heave.
He's coming.
We have him!
How much have we got to get?
We'll get no inch of him now for a while.
Hold what you got. Hold what you got.
Hold what you got.
Steady now.
There's too much strain on it now.
Turned fish on the end of it.
That side?
Down that way.
Have you any sight of him there, Tommy?
He's down this way.
- See him, Coley?
- Yes.
I see the way the rope is going.
- The line.
- He's holding on the bottom now, Pat.
- You thinks so?
- He is.
I tell you now, watch for those bubbles.
Watch for those bubbles, Coley and have your harpoon ready.
Yes.
See the bubbles and before he makes a dash for the open sea...
Look out. He's going to make a drive. Look out.
He's on this side now again, Pat.
Get the second harpoon out.
We have a good chance.
See him?
Yes. I see him. I see him.
- Pretty close now to you.
- I know.
Steady yourself down.
Pretty close.
Round the stern, he's there, Pat.
I'm working around the boat.
- Another little heave.
- There he is!
Here he is. We have him.
Here he is.
Go for that tail there now, Coley.
He looks pretty weak, I think.
Here he is.
Steady now. Steady now.
Easy piece of meat.
- Do you think?
- Yes.
Watch the tail, you, anyhow.
It doesn't matter how weak they are.
A blow from that'd kill you.
There he is.
He's shook.
Played out, I think.
About time now.
When you see your chance.
When you see your chance.
- He looks about played out, I think.
- I'm trying to get a hook into him.
Go for that tail.
Go for that tail there.
Look out. Mind yourself.
- Ah, I think he's about.
- That he is.
Now turn.
- I'll get another harpoon in.
- Go on. Make a good drive.
Drive it! Go!
Let it go!
Give him line! Give him line!
Give him line!
We're in for the long haul now anyway.
Heave!
What the devil are you doing, Mike?
I'm going with you.
- You can't come with us.
- I want to go.
Back with you now.
No, I must go.
Our hands are full enough without you. Back with you.
There.
Be a good boy now and go home.
Hurry on, Mike.
Did you think that you could go without your harpoon?
Good boy, there.
Right you are, boy.
Just the harpoon, Stephen.
Shove it up there.
I'm going with you today.
- No, you cannot come with us.
- I want to go.
- Good boy, now. Go home.
- Oh, let me go.
There might be big sea in it and
I don't like the looks of the weather.
Come on, Michael, quick!
Michael, come on.
That's it!
Mind the rock!
Mind the rock!
Mind the rock!
Mind the rock!
Get that rope!
Come on, Colin!
Let her go!
Michael, run!
Let's go.
Come on and fetch the line. Come on.
God bless you!
# Do you know why #

# But do you know that tonight the streets are ours? #
# These lights in our street are ours #
# Tonight the streets are ours #
# These lights in our hearts #
# They tell no lies #
Okay.
Sound check, please.
One, two.
One, two.
Okay.
One, two.
- Comfortable?
- Yep.
So, um, I guess I'll start off by asking you about the film.
What is the film?
Uh, well, the film is the story of what happened when this guy tried to make a documentary about me, but he was actually a lot more interesting than I am, so now the film is kind of about him.
I mean, it's not
Gone with the Wind, but there's probably a moral in there somewhere.
So who is this guy?
"This guy " was Thierry Guetta, a Frenchman who had been living in Los Angeles since emigrating to the United States in the early 1980s.
A regular family man,
Thierry owned a vintage clothing store in the city's most bohemian shopping district, and he made a good living selling his wares to L.A.'s more fashion-conscious citizens.
At that time,
I used to buy old Adidas and old things and, you know, things you couldn't find here: shoes, bags.
And I had a warehouse with big bales of these clothes, and we used to buy these for $50.
I used to take things that, when the sewing was different,
I call it designer, and I'd put the price that is $400.
So from $50, sometimes I could make $5,000.
But there was one very unusual thing about Thierry.
He never went anywhere without a video camera.
I don't know how the video camera came into my hand, but I know the moment it came inside my hand,
I couldn't let it down, ever.
It was like more than any drugs to anybody.
It was obsession.
When I picked up the camera,
I couldn't do anything without capturing it.
I'd keep filming, keep filming, keep filming.
I was filming and filming myself filming me.
It didn't stop.
It just didn't stop.
Ooh...
In my own house, when the kids grow up,
I had cameras set up everywhere.
I was completely maxed with camera.
Even taking pictures, he would do it like... you know, like, he was using even the picture camera like he would use the video camera.
He was pretty much obsessed.
He filmed constantly... tapes and tapes and tapes.
Aaaagh!
As time passed, those who knew Thierry stopped even noticing his ever-present camera, while everyone else soon learned how determined he could be.
Can I take one picture before I go?
You know what?
We're working right now.
One picture, yeah.
All right, go ahead.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Thanks.
Thanks.
C'est Shaq.
Hey, how you doing?
What you doin', bud?
Ça va?
Say hello to the French people.
Hello, French people.
That's enough.
Stop recording.
That's good.
That's good.
When you gonna film someone else?
Yeah, man, I do.
- Eh?
- I do.
Why don't you go and do it now?
Because it's not every day that I see you.
Thierry seemed happy enough selling clothes and pointing his camera at anything that moved until in 1999, on a family holiday to France, a chance discovery sent Thierry's life in a dramatic new direction.
My cousin, at that time, he was an artistic... you know, he was putting mosaics together and trying to do the game of Space Invaders, re-creating the character, kind of way.
So I film him.
It was kind of fun, because he was, like, doing some tile, very small, and putting it on top of couple building, and I thought it was really nice, to put some stuff that you love, something that you want to express yourself, and put it outside and people can see it.
Thierry's cousin was Space Invader, a major player in an explosive new movement that would become known as street art.
This hybrid form of graffiti was driven by a new generation using stickers, stencils, posters, and sculptures to make their mark by any means necessary.
With the arrival of the internet, these once-temporary works could be shared by an audience of millions.
Street art was poised to become the biggest countercultural movement since punk, and Thierry had landed right in the middle of it.
When I was with Thierry,
Thierry was with his camera, and he was filming me all the time, but when people were asking me what this guy's doing,
I was saying, "It's okay; it's my cousin."
And generally, people were thinking,
"Oh, this guy is cool."
Like, "Let him film."
Through my cousin,
I met André.
André has this character that is a smiling face that's blinking an eye and, you know, with, like, long legs and walking everywhere, you know, like kind of a cartoon character.
When I met Zeus, he was, like, painting, like, shadows on the streets of different things.
I liked to capture those people because I thought it was nice, what they were doing, and they really believe it.
You know, they really loved it.
I started to really see, like, a gallery outside.
I just loved it, you know, filming at night and street, because it was, like, a mix of fears and getting something that nobody sees, and somewhere you and... illegal, and you can get caught, you know?
So it was, like, that feeling that it was, like, a danger, and I like that.
You know, I like the danger.
You know, it made me feel good.
Thierry had accidentally found a focus.
The man who would film anything had stumbled into an intriguing underground world, and now that he had found it, he wasn't about to let it go.
I guess Thierry was in the right place at the right time, really.
I mean, the thing is that most all art is built to last, like, hundreds of years.
It's cast in bronze, or it's oil on canvas, but street art has a short lifespan, so it needed documenting.
You know, we all needed someone who knew how to use a camera.
Fuck.
A few months later,
Invader visited Los Angeles for the first time, giving Thierry the chance to pursue his new passion on home turf.
You can't do that here.
It's to take pictures.
Right.
Not here.
Not that, no.
That's graffiti.
That's not graffiti.
No, no, but that's not.
That's not graffiti.
Then remove it, because you guys got to go.
That's an art.
That's an art.
You guys need to go.
But this is, like, Space Invader.
You know Space Invader?
I know Space Invader.
Not here, no.
You don't know Space Invader?
Go!
I was filming Space Invader, but I wanted more.
You know?
So I mean, it's like,
I could get him all the time, so I wanted somebody that I couldn't get.
Thierry's opportunity to meet someone who could keep him in steady thrills came a few days later when Invader arranged to meet up with another
West Coast street artist.
His name was Shepard Fairey.
One day,
Shepard would be famous for transforming the face of an unknown senator into a universally recognized icon.
But even back in 2000,
Shepard was the world's most prolific street artist.
Shepard's experiment with the power of repetition went back to 1989 and an image based on cult '70s wrestler
Andre the Giant.
Combining Andre's face with a command to obey,
Shepard had already clocked up over a million hits around the world.
And although he didn't know it yet, his world was about to collide head-on with Thierry's.
Shepard Fairey was at Kinko's on Vine, and Space Invader had something, a trouble with something, and he couldn't make it that moment.
But me, I wanted to meet the guy, so what I did,
I went and meet him.
- Invader.
- No, Thierry.
I didn't ask him;
I just filmed.
That was my thing.
I didn't ask him anything.
When I came,
I came with a camera, and I start filming.
So why did you do him?
You don't know?
- Uh...
- Oh, you knew the guy.
He's funny-looking.
No.
Oh, you didn't know him?
- No, I didn't know him.
- Do you think he's dead, or...
Oh, he's dead, yeah.
Yeah?
So you have a partner works with you, eh?
Yeah.
This is Amanda.
Amanda, how are you doing?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.
So how long you been doing this?
101/2 years.
Oh, yeah?
That's a lot of paper.
Yeah.
What do you do?
I film.
That night when
Shepard did meet Space Invader, he took him on a tour of the city.
Thierry was there filming everything that Space Invader was doing and then, of course, once I was with Space Invader, everything I was doing.
You should probably put an invader up on Hollywood Boulevard.
- What do you think, Thierry?
- Yeah.
And when Invader returned to France,
Thierry simply carried on, tagging along at Shepard's side whenever the artist went out in the streets.
- 2:00... if he's gonna be out past 2:00, he needs to call at 2:00.
Okay.
I'll make him.
Otherwise, he gets beat, and he sleeps on the couch.
Amanda always thought that he was weird, but I said it's great that we're getting a lot of this stuff on tape.
And for me to have someone there as a lookout was always good.
Keep your eye out for the cops.
I finally did train him to not turn the light on while I was on a billboard or a rooftop, where he was gonna blow my cover.
No, no, no, don't use that.
Yeah.
After ten months of Thierry's constant presence, the question inevitably arose:
What exactly was Thierry filming for?
It's cool, though, right?
And that was the moment
Thierry came up with a big idea that would dictate the path of his life for the next eight years.
In the beginning, you're, like, thinking, like, "The guy's gonna film me one time, two times, three times, five times, ten times, twelve times, " but after a while, he's like,
"What you gonna do?"
Because usually people film a day, two days, three days, and they make something out of it.
But I kept filming, so he's like,
"What you gonna do?"
And I said, "I'm gonna make a street art documentary, " you know?
Take two.
In his new role as documentary filmmaker,
Thierry now started traveling the world with Shepard, recording every detail of the artist's life.
I knew that couldn't be far away.
Even though the Andre the Giant sticker was just an inside joke and I was just having fun,
I liked the idea of the more stickers that are out there, the more important it seems; the more important it seems, the more people want to know what it is, the more they ask each other, and it gains real power from perceived power.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Police officer.
I'm not gonna arrest you.
I'm not gonna arrest you.
I just want to talk to you, dude.
Don't film from that side.
Film from this side over here.
You understand why, right?
Because you're gonna attract attention.
Oop! Whoa!
It was like a big adventure every night.
We were going on top of buildings and going on top of something that was not just illegal; it was dangerous.
But I would do it because I wanted to show that I could do it.
You know, it was not like,
I'm downstairs and you are upstairs doing your thing and I'm filming.
No.
I would go upstairs, and I would go even up, up more to have the shot that is great.
He just wanted to go whenever I was going, and he was always... he was always very diligent about climbing, about helping move the buckets, the ladder.
He was not only a filmer, but in ways, he was an accomplice, and I don't know whether it's just that he's passionate or whether it's that he's passionate and he's kinda crazy.
But I respect passion.
But it wasn't just Shepard who caught Thierry's eye.
As he ventured further afield,
Thierry was constantly meeting new street artists.
And in my head,
I wanted to make a movie about street art, so I wanted to get as much people as possible.
Even people who tell me,
"No, I don't want to be filmed, "
I find a way of making the no as a yes.
Oh, cool.
I love the design of it.
So you draw.
You know how to draw?
It's a painting.
Yeah.
And I start to know one, and one make me meet another one.
Very important when you put the poster to see where you're gonna put it.
Usually, I just...
I choose a wall
'cause I like it,
I like what it feels like, you know?
The texture.
When I go with the artist,
I'm just living them life.
You know?
I'm a ghost when I'm with them.
I'm kind of a ghost.
Don't you wish to be taller sometimes?
Shut the fuck up.
So what name you are using?
Borf.
It was the name of my best friend who killed himself when we were 16...
And I just do it to...
I don't know... commemorate his life.
You gonna hit that?
We're gonna do both.
- Are you gonna do both?
- Yeah.
But, like, I think it'd be cool if you came up with us.
Excuse me, sir?
Can I have a quick word with you, sir, please?
Excuse me?
Could I just have a quick word with you, please?
If I can ask you to stop any recording that you're doing.
- It's not recording.
- That's fine.
- Do you understand English?
- Yes.
That's fine, sir.
I'm sure you can appreciate graffiti's a criminal offense.
Right?
Thierry's documentary was shaping up to be the authentic inside story of the birth of a movement starring the biggest figures in the street art world... with one exception.
Now Tate Britain in Pimlico refused to discuss security arrangements today after a graffiti artist known as Banksy was able to leave one of his own paintings in the gallery's landscape room.
I hear about this Banksy.
"Who's Banksy?
Banksy?
Banksy this."
And I said,
"I really like that guy."
You know?
And it's like,
"I want... I want... I want to interview this guy."
Thierry wasn't the only one intrigued.
By now, word about this mystery provocateur and his increasingly ambitious adventures was radiating far beyond the world of street art.
Banksy had started out as a provincial graffiti artist, but before long, his stencils were appearing all over Britain.
Through a series of DIY art shows,
Banksy was now taking vandalism in an entirely new direction.
So I ask Space Invader.
I ask everybody that I knew.
"How can I get this guy?"
They said, "It's impossible.
It's impossible."
But my focus in my head, it was like,
"How am I gonna make it?
How am I gonna make it?
It's impossible, but how am I gonna make it?"
While Thierry schemes to find a way to the one missing star of his film, his other subjects carried on, letting Thierry capture every moment of their creative process.
What none of them suspected was that Thierry's street art documentary didn't actually exist.
All the tape that I film, even if it was good, it was going nowhere.
It was going in a box somewhere.
Sometime I don't even write anything.
Sometime I write the year.
Sometime I write nothing.
But I would never watch it.
Never, never, never.
When it was filmed, for me, it was done.
It wasn't important, how it was made.
It was important what it was.
It was the capturation.
Thierry's extraordinary habit of filming everything and locking the unwatched tapes away in boxes had its roots in his childhood in France.
I lost my mother when I was 11 years old, and the day that I find out about my mother,
I was at school.
I remember I was in the playground, and somebody come up, and he says,
"Oh, you're laughing, eh?
You're laughing, eh?
You're laughing, eh?"
Like, behind the gate.
"Your mother is dead."
Like this.
And after, I was like...
I didn't know, in reality, and after I went back to class, and I was crying, and I didn't know.
And from that things, they took me away.
I never went home again.
I went to a cousin or something outside of what happened, not to see anything.
You know, they just took me away from everything happened.
The youngest in a large family, his mother's illness had been kept from Thierry, and after her death, the sense that he had missed such an important event stayed with him.
Later, as an adult raising his own family,
Thierry became increasingly compelled by the need to record the people and events around him.
You know, I felt like I should capture everything on film, because I felt like everything that I would capture at these moments, any time in my life would be the last time that
I would see it the same way.
It was like a need to be captured.
I would make them live forever, those moments, you know, forever and ever.
Making a documentary, it was like having the key of getting all these people.
That's why
I kept following them, following them, following them.
And because I never made a movie before and I don't know how to stop... and I don't know how to stop...
I kept going.
As Thierry persevered with his quest to capture the world of street art in its entirety, the profile of the one artist who eluded him was about to become bigger than ever.
He faced Israeli army fire to pull off his latest stunt.
Subversive graffiti artist
Banksy, whose work...
By targeting the world's most notorious wall,
Banksy turned a spot of hit-and-run vandalism into an international news event.
Now it seemed everyone wanted to know the answer to one question:
Who was Banksy?
His work seemed to be everywhere, but the artist himself remained as elusive as ever.
He was, like, the only one that I don't have, and people that used to be in street art, they all tell you,
"Yeah, he doesn't have a phone, " or they... even if they do have it, they wouldn't give it to me, you know?
I didn't know what way that
I'm gonna get this person, you know, what angel was gonna bring me to that person.
With no leads to go on,
Thierry was forced to accept that he may never find a way to the mysterious Englishman.
And then, miraculously...
So I went to Los Angeles at about spring 2006, and when I got there, the guy that was supposed to be helping me got turned back at immigration, so I rang the only person I knew in Los Angeles and asked them if they could help me, and they said,
"Well, there's this French guy, he's a cousin of Space Invader, and he knows where all the best walls are in L.A.
He can help you out."
I was in downtown
Los Angeles one day.
My phone rings.
"Hello?"
"Hello, this is Shepard Fairey.
How are you doing, Thierry?"
"Uh, yeah."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, do you have any walls?
Because I have Banksy here, and I would like "...
And I said, "What?
You have who?"
I'm like, "Uh..."
"Yeah, yeah, there is Banksy here, and "...
I'm like, "Where... are... you?"
Red light.
I stay.
I vrrr...
I go through red light.
I was driving like crazy.
I mean, I'm lucky
I didn't get caught that day.
So this guy shows up looking like something out of the 1860s, with these, like, huge sideburns, sweating, telling me he could do anything; he could take me anywhere; he could get me whatever I wanted; he could fix it all up.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, what do you want?
Anything you want.
What do you want?"
He said,
"Have you got a phone?"
And I said no, so he went to a phone shop over the road and bought me a phone, and he bought $100 worth of credit and punched his number in and said,
"Right, this is my number.
You call me.
I have everything you need."
"I drive you if you need to go anywhere.
"I'll take care of you ".
Whatever, whatever.
"I'll be your driver.
I'm not doing anything.
I'm not doing anything.
I'm not doing anything at any time."
So on the understanding that he would just help me make some paintings, we went out that evening.
Circumstances had conspired to bring Thierry face-to-face with the notoriously secretive artist, and fate remained on Thierry's side when he got his camera out.
Well, I'd never let anybody film anything before, but I said he could film me, but only my hands, from behind, and on condition that I could check the tapes afterwards.
It was magic that this person let me film, you know?
I felt like I had the piece that will finish the puzzle.
It was like getting something in the daylight that what you see in the night light.
He was even more than I expected.
I mean, he was, like, just incredible.
He was cool.
He was... he was human.
He was... he was... he was... he was... he is the... you know, he's really like what he represent.
You know, he's really, like...
I think he's really, like...
I really liked him.
For the rest of Banksy's stay,
Thierry made himself indispensable, leading the artist to some of the best painting spots in the city.
I mean, Thierry was the perfect host if you're a graffiti rat and you're miles from home.
He had no fear.
He wanted to keep going all night long, and he had a massive larder.
A few weeks after their chance encounter in L.A.,
Banksy invited Thierry to England.
I always avoided cameras,
'cause what I do is in a bit of a legal gray area, but I brought Thierry over to London because it seemed like a good idea: start videoing the work.
I mean, we had to,
'cause, you know, a lot of it was starting to disappear the next day.
But Banksy's close-knit team of trusted friends was horrified by the sudden appearance of this camera-happy Frenchman.
The first time that Thierry was filming Banksy,
I was like,
"What the fuck is going on?"
I thought, you know, that nobody was allowed to do this.
I felt it was a big breach of security.
Being the man of mystery and being filmed at the same time is a slight oxymoron,
I think.
It's a very dangerous thing.
All the people who was working with him, they didn't understand.
They look at me like,
"Who is this?
Who is this guy?"
You know,
"What is he gonna do to us?"
You know?
And he didn't care whatsoever.
Two, three.
I guess Thierry showed up at a time when I realized that the reaction to this stuff was, you know, one of the most interesting things about it, because for me, it's an important part of the job to run away as soon as we've done it, but at least with Thierry, we had someone hanging round afterwards who could capture some of it.
This is when I saw that he was, like, a legend.
He was like kind of a Robin Hood or something.
- You know Banksy?
- Yeah.
- You know Banksy?
- I don't know.
I mean, I heard about him.
He does very, very good graffiti.
Looks a bit like Banksy, but I know he's doing a bit more installations at the moment.
I like it.
I like it.
What do you think of it?
Someone is annoyed with BT telephones.
Yeah, we were, you know, laughing like trains at all this stuff he got out of it.
So yeah, he proved his worth on that project, brought something to it that we would never have had otherwise.
Over the rest of his time in London,
Banksy took Thierry everywhere, even allowing him to film inside his studio as he prepared for his first big American show.
He opened his door to me, and it was magic kind of way.
You ask the question,
"Why me?" in the end.
"Why?"
I think maybe Thierry was like a bit of a release for me, you know?
Having spent years of trying to keep everything completely under wraps, maybe I needed to trust somebody.
I mean, I guess part of the power of Thierry is this unlikely... the unlikeliness of it.
Yeah, you know?
I guess he became my friend.
Oh.
It's all money.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It is real?
It's Lady Di instead of the queen.
It's so cool.
I made £1 million worth, and I was gonna throw it off a building, just like...
But I took some out, and I handed some out first of all, and people spent them, and people were like,
"Oh, yeah.
Two beers.
A couple beers."
Nobody noticed, because when you got them like this, you can actually spend them.
And they won't know.
And when that happened, it was like, "Holy shit.
We just... we just forged a million quid."
And obviously, for that, you go to jail for ten years.
So I have them up here, but I don't know what to do with them.
You find it here?
I made it.
Wow, you made this?
For fuck's sake,
I printed it.
Oh, my God.
Back in L.A.,
Thierry struggled to keep himself entertained after the high of his scoop with Banksy.
# If I don't get my i-i-i-ice cream #
I'm like a bird.
I always thought of that.
I'm like a bird.
I never want to be locked down anywhere.
I like to fly from one artist to another.
You know, that's the way that I live, one life to another.
You know, I like to be free.
You know, my wife was worried because, you know, bill to pays, and me, the only thing
I wanted to do was, like, buy some tape and go somewhere, you know?
I wasn't worried, but I'm sure my wife had a little problem of sleeping sometime.
He was following the artists, and he goes to here, he goes there, and I worry.
I worry for my kids.
I worry for everybody, actually, but he doesn't care.
He just goes and does.
And he forgets he comes with a family.
You know, just... we need him.
Bye, Gigi!
Bye, Jackie!
Bye!
I love you!
For five years,
Thierry's family had learned to cope with his endless trips away, but now there was a new development taking up his time.
The way it started,
I took picture of me holding a camera, and I asked somebody to illustrate it, and I liked it, so I made a small sticker.
And I made it transparent, you know, because I never solid, transparent.
A transparent looked like a little stencil in a way.
And I liked it, so I went to Kinko's, because I learned from "Obey " and things like this, and I started making that photocopy...
I don't know... 30 feet by 40 feet high, you know?
And I went at 10:00 at night until 8:00 in the morning, and I made, like, this image giant of me with the camera.
That big image, I thought it was kind of cool.
And I start doing it kind of the same story of "Obey, " following the movement of street art.
I start to make copies, make it bigger, and starting to put it all around the city.
The enjoyment of taking the glue and making the thing and going,
I was, like, addict.
It was like a spiral, and I just fall in it.
I just fall in the spiral.
"Aaaah!"
I fall, like, making the art.
A few months after
Thierry had seen him in London,
Banksy returned to Los Angeles.
He had arrived with his crew to transform a large run-down warehouse into the venue for his first major U.S. exhibition,
"Barely Legal."
Oh, my God.
It's really big.
It is giant.
Trippy.
It's the biggest elephant
I ever saw in my life.
Look at this.
It's really big.
But Banksy had more on his mind than getting the show's surprise guest ready for her big moment.
We were right in the middle of putting the show together, and I had this idea to make a piece about Guantánamo Bay and the detention of all these terror suspects, so I took Thierry with me, and we didn't tell anyone else about it, and we just shot off, like, the morning before the show.
I came, picked him up.
Just me and him.
You know, I'm kind of excited
I'm going to Disneyland.
In just a few moments, we will begin our trip...
It was around the anniversary of September the 11th, so it was a pretty high-temper moment.
Can I get two adults just for Disneyland, please?
$2 is your change, and your two Disneyland tickets.
Is Mickey Mouse gonna be there today?
Yes, Mickey Mouse will be there.
You go to Toontown, and he's waiting for you guys.
Okay?
So we've been wandering around the park for a while, and then there's this sign with a picture of a camera on it saying,
"This will be a great place to take your souvenir photo."
So that obviously seemed like the best place to put him.
He's like, "This is where I'm gonna do it."
And I'm like, "Okay."
He goes in the corner and starting to blow up, through a pump, a doll.
Tssh, tssh, tssh, tssh.
And he goes, and he start... put it in.
And he put it.
He attached it to the metal bars, and he takes time, and it was kind of suspense, because, you know, it's Disneyland.
There is... people comes.
And then I walked off one way and left Thierry there filming it.
And me, I'm filming, taking pictures...
Because it's like, you know... it's, like, the moment that I'm here for.
In one moment, they stopped the train.
We start to see some people coming in, security and people like this, but not dressed like security, but look like, you know, like people who's not at Disneyland to have fun, you know?
So I'm starting to feel scared.
I'm walking to leave.
One guy is behind me; two guys behind me; three guys behind me; four guys behind me.
And one moment, pom, pom, pom, pom, pom, from every corner, they were on me.
I went in the toilet to change my hat.
I changed my shirt.
Then I went out, and I went on the, like, Indiana Jones ride, and then when I came off that,
I tried calling Thierry, didn't get any answer, so then I went on Pirates of the Caribbean.
While Banksy went on the rides,
Thierry was being introduced to a very different side of the Magic Kingdom.
So they put me in a seat.
There is a guy here, a guy there... and they said, "You are in big, big, big trouble."
So they actually started shutting down parts of the park.
There was, like, walkie-talkies crackling everywhere, and all of sudden, it seemed to be a very, very serious thing indeed.
Held in an interrogation room,
Thierry was questioned by Disney's security people and one man who claimed he was from the FBI.
I'm like, "I don't know what you have on me.
I was there.
You're, like, telling me that I have something to do with this person.
I don't have anything to do with this person.
I don't have anything to do with it.
I mean, it's...
I was there at the wrong time at the wrong moment, you know.
I was taking pictures, " and things like this.
And he says, "Did you take a lot of pictures?"
I said,
"No, I took one picture, " and things like this,
"but I even delete it when you guys came to me."
No... the camera is on the table.
It's full of pictures, and I'm telling that to the guy.
So I'm lying completely.
The only thing he has to do is to turn on that camera.
So I tried Thierry again, and this time he answered, and I said, "Where are you?"
And he said,
"Hello, my chéri, " and, "How are you, my darling?" and, "How are the children?"
And I thought, "Yeah."
At that point, I thought
I'd better leave the park.
He's like, "Okay, show me the pictures."
I take the camera...
I take him...
I said, "Look."
I put it on, I go...
I go on Menu right away,
I go on Delete, and I go, "Pffft!"
And the thing goes,
"Vvvvt!"
And I go, "Pom!"
I put it down, and I said,
"I don't have any picture on him, and I don't have any proof on you.
I don't have nothing with you guys, and I don't have nothing with this guy, because I don't know who it is."
Like this, I don't... you know, I'm clear.
After four hours of questioning, with no evidence to hold him,
Thierry was released.
So after Thierry withstood interrogation from the entire Mickey Mouse security team... didn't fold, didn't buckle; he did a really good job of stashing the tape in his sock...
I guess I trusted Thierry with everything.
He was my guy after that.
Hey, man.
How are you?
Good.
How are you doing?
Yeah, yeah.
The day after his close shave with Disneyland,
Thierry, along with half of Hollywood.
Was at the opening party for Banksy's show.
It was an even bigger star, however, who provoked the real sensation.
Banksy had camouflaged his rented elephant with 12 liters of children's face paint in an apparent statement about how easy it is to ignore the things right in front of us.
But the American news media could only see what was right in front of them and came flocking to report on the elephant in the room.
I'm Angie Crouch.
Coming up at 5:30, animal rights activists are outraged over an art exhibit involving a live painted elephant.
"There's an elephant in the room, a problem that we never talk about," says this small white card given to visitors...
What's the matter?
Just say when.
Um, you already got your interview, so can you...
The magical combination of controversy, celebrity, and the painted elephant turned the show into an event.
We had the sort of attendance that you get for a decent show at the Museum of Modern Art or something, only over three days and in skid row.
So I think a lot of the people in the art world were a little bit confused as to how that would happen, you know?
As were we, to be honest.
"Barely Legal " marked the point at which street art was forced into the spotlight, attracting sudden interest from the art establishment.
In the months that followed, prices for work by leading street artists rocketed, with collectors rushing to get in on this exciting new market.
Lot number 33A,
Banksy, the vandalized phone box.
And I'll start the bid at $100,000.
Street art had become a white-hot commodity.
Now no serious contemporary art collection would be complete without a Banksy.
For $550,000.
Those little bunnies are Warhols.
That's a Lichtenstein.
And then that's Keith Haring, who I'm not a fan of.
The Andy Warhol "Mao " is the first thing I ever bought.
I was, like, 20 years old, and I put it on layaway, and it's, you know, the smaller "Mao."
And it's beautiful.
I mean, it's beautiful, but it's in a... it's in the closet.
Oh, yeah, here's the Ba... here's a big Banksy.
That one's from the show in L.A.
I saw Banksy, and I thought he was a genius, and every person I told about him bought something, like people who have Picassos and, you know, Mondrians and Paul Klee and...
God, I don't even know who else.
They have...
I mean, serious collections.
So then these famous auction houses, all of a sudden, they were selling street art, and everything was getting a bit crazier, and suddenly, it had all become about the money, but it never was about the money.
So I said to Thierry,
"Right, you have the footage.
You can tell the real story of what this art is about.
It's not about the hype.
It's not about the money.
Now is the time.
You need to get your film out."
Banksy had put Thierry well and truly on the spot.
He now had to devise a way to transform thousands of hours of unwatched tapes into the epic documentary he had been promising everyone for so long.
So we start working in the back of my house, doing some editing.
It was, like, kind of a vision that I saw.
And the way that I made it,
I really did it kind of the way, you know, like, when you have a bucket and you have a lot of numbers and you said... you look in one, and you open, and you said,
"This is the number 12."
This is the way that I made it, kind of way.
I used to... couple tape here, couple tape here, couple tape here, couple tape here, take a little piece over here, a little piece of that, a little piece of that, and this is the way that I made it.
Okay, now let's go back a little bit and do a review, because...
Like, what I say:
I'm playing chess.
I don't know how to play chess, but life is a chess game for me.
The following spring,
Thierry returned to England.
I'm gonna do a flip.
All his years of filming and thousands of hours of material had been crafted into a 90-minute film with the intriguing title
Life Remote Control.
He called up, and he came to London because he said he'd nearly finished the film, and he came round my house and put the DVD on, and he said, "This is it.
It's nearly finished."
Um... you know, it was at that point that I realized that maybe Thierry wasn't actually a filmmaker and he was maybe just someone with mental problems who happened to have a camera.
It just seemed to go on and on.
It was an hour and a half of unwatchable nightmare trailers, essentially like somebody with a short attention span with a remote control flicking through a cable box of 900 channels.
Peace to the whole world.
You have to keep an eye on the big picture.
I told him I'd never seen anything like it, and I wasn't lying about that.
Yeah, I was faced with that terrible thing when somebody shows you their work and everything about it is shit so you don't really know where to start.
He's like, "It's good," you know?
"It's good," you know?
"It's good."
I mean, the thing is that Thierry had all this amazing footage of all this stuff that, you know, in this tiny world of street art, was kind of important, and it was never gonna happen again.
So it felt right to at least make something that you could actually watch about it.
So I thought, you know, maybe I could have a go.
I mean, I don't know how to make a film, but obviously, that hadn't stopped Thierry, but I needed him out of the way in order to do it, so I said,
"Why don't you go and put up some more of your posters and make some art, you know, have a little show, invite a few people, get some bottles of wine?"
And off he went back to Los Angeles, and he left me with the tapes.
Thierry returned home to Los Angeles full of enthusiasm for his unexpected new assignment.
Banksy had just given him what he considered to be a direct order: to put down his camera and become a street artist himself.
I think he put me into street art because I like what he did.
Me, as respecting him, you know, having him to push you to do street art,
I just went and, like... it was not even a push.
It was, like, an enjoyment to get pushed, you know.
So now, using the formula he had seen work so well for the world's biggest street artists,
Thierry set about creating his own alter ego and iconic visual style.
I came up with the idea that the whole movement of art is all about brainwashing.
"Obey" is about brainwashing.
Banksy's about brainwashing.
So I use MBW, and I am Mr. Brainwash.
But Mr. Brainwash had some catching up to do.
Many of the biggest names in the street art world had moved on to gallery shows, so Thierry now started to plan the next phase of his artistic career.
When Banksy had suggested to Thierry that he make some art, he could never have imagined just how far things would go.
We have a mountain of...
Thierry had now remortgaged his business and sold off whatever he could to invest in a huge studio, screen-printing equipment, and a full-time staff capable of producing MBW pieces on a commercial scale.
Just wait one second.
Okay.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
When you have Damien Hirst, one of the most expensive artists in our generation today, and having 100 people working for him, do you think that he's gonna come and cut little papers and start to glue?
No.
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm just gonna come with the idea and say,
"This is what I want, and I want this like that."
Thierry's creative process,
I guess, he's inspired by other things.
I guess who isn't inspired by other things?
We have, like... look at this.
Like, he goes, and he, like... four different-color Post-its in here.
That means... no, five,
I think.
So he went through this book four or five times and, like, selected different pictures, wrote notes, and they're all in, like, fairly bad English.
Thierry goes through the books.
He finds the paintings that he likes, and he comes up with the ideas on what to change them, and we scan the image, and then we Photoshop.
This one is Elvis.
It's, like, a piece that I made.
It's, like, I changed Elvis.
He had a guitar, and I put in a toy from Fisher-Price.
You know, a toy from Fisher-Price, and this piece called
"Don't Be Cruel."
And this is what I create.
It's, like, to trying to do some lines that, when you're close to it, when you're really close to it, you just see lines.
Any kind of people, they come to the market, and what they see?
Bar code.
They come to the thing, so they leave with it.
They brainwash.
That's why I call myself
Mr. Brainwash.
It's because everything that I do somewhere brainwash your face.
This is one piece that I really like, kind of way, an it says, "Bat Papi, 1893."
It's before Batman.
It's Bat Papi.
You know, the papi, it's the father of... the grandfather of Batman.
You know?
That's who started, you know?
While most artists work their way up from small beginnings,
Thierry was determined that Mr. Brainwash would arrive with a bang.
The former CBS studio complex covering 15,000 square feet in the heart of old Hollywood had lain empty for almost a year until Thierry decided it would make the perfect venue for his debut show,
"Life is Beautiful."
I didn't want to disappoint Banksy.
I wanted to try to do something big.
In the end, it's gonna become, like, a big space with pictures all around.
I want to make it more like a show.
Like, there is a park amusement;
I'm making it an art amusement.
You know, I change "park " to "art."
Thierry's plan was to emulate Banksy's L.A. show by transforming the cavernous space into a street art spectacular filled not just with paintings but sculptures and installations too.
And if he didn't know how to do any of these things himself, he could always employ people who did.
I answered a nondescript ad looking for sculptors or artists who could work in papier-mâché.
He said he just needed some things built and he wanted to know if I could build him an eight-foot-tall spray paint can, and I said, "Absolutely."
And he said, "Can you build me a monster out of TVs?" and I said, "Sure."
And then he actually got us into the space and had us working on a day rate so that he could kind of keep coming up with projects and change 'em around.
With a growing workforce and Thierry adding new projects by the hour, the scale of his production was now running far ahead of the little show
Banksy had suggested.
I was so much focused on it that I put all my money in it.
Everything that I owned,
I put it in it.
I was refinancing the house.
I was putting my life on... on the border of losing everything that I own.
And just when it seemed that the pressure couldn't get any more intense, and with his grand opening now set for just three weeks away, disaster struck.
# Go! #
So basically, this is the... called... this bone's called your metatarsal, and this is the fifth one.
It's all the way on the side of your foot.
And you fractured it right through here, and this piece has been pulled back a little bit.
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Needing an operation,
Thierry was ordered to slow things down, and now, under the influence of pain-numbing drugs, he at last glimpsed the enormity of the enterprise he had embarked upon.
It's just so much work to do, prices, and... it's like being an artist overnight.
You know, that's what's happening to me.
You know?
I'm nobody.
I never did an exposition in a gallery, really.
I never show any work anywhere, and I'm doing this big show, and it's all... it's all a make-up kind of way, you know?
I mean, it was all starting to sound a little bit crazy.
These reports are coming back saying that Thierry had found this huge warehouse and then he'd broken his leg and it was all kind of going a little bit wrong.
You know, it sounded like he needed a little bit of help, so I rung a few people that I thought might be able to help him out.
Like, this room looks cool.
This room looks interesting.
This room looks almost done.
If this room stayed like this, that's cool, but...
But that's one out of four, five, six.
That makes the rest of the rooms look bad.
Myself and my girlfriend, Sonja, went down there, and we figured out what he needed along with a few of the show's other producers.
We made lists of what needed to happen.
What's the capacity of this place?
I don't know.
Capacity's approximately gonna be, like, 750 to 800.
Got it.
What about getting...
I was very curious how the hell he was actually gonna finish it and pull it off and realized he didn't have a clue of a lot of the final logistics that needed to happen.
Like I saw in Banksy's show, mostly, the people came and came back.
He'd seen people do big art shows.
He'd been to them around the world.
He figured, "I want to do something just as great."
And the insurance?
The insurance, we're taking care of.
With Roger and the team now taking care of the practical arrangements,
Thierry was free to spend time selecting which of his many pieces to include in the show.
Valet parking, or they just go?
But instead,
Thierry busied himself with a different concern altogether... hype.
He asked me to promote the show for him, to give him a quote for a press release, to send it to my mailing list, to post it on my website, and really, to validate what he was doing.
And I was uncomfortable with that, but I said that I would do it.
So then I got a phone call from Thierry, or Mr. Brainwash, as he was now calling himself, asking if I would give him a quote to promote his show.
And I didn't think there was any harm in it, so I wrote him a sentence, and I emailed it off.
But Banksy could never have guessed what Thierry had in mind for his modest contribution.
So this is gonna be like a jail.
It's gonna have bars here.
I'm gonna put some more cans all the way...
The endorsements were immediately picked up by the media, and within days,
Thierry was being interviewed by the editor of the city's biggest listings magazine,
L.A. Weekly.
The only thing
I want to do in L.A. is to show that Los Angeles can have great shows.
You know, it's like a revolution kind of way.
A few days later,
Los Angeles awoke to discover there was a new star in town.
MBW was front-page news.
- Okay.
- "Life is Beautiful."
The L.A. Weekly also reported
Thierry's promotional brain wave: the first 200 people to turn up would be given a free, one-of-a-kind screen print.
Do you think that people is gonna wait and wait for the 200 free posters or no?
So now Thierry had to come up with a way of turning
200 identical screen prints into unique, collectible
MBW originals.
With a crew of 20 people working around the clock, the building was at last beginning to resemble an art gallery.
But the walls remained bare because Thierry still hadn't decided which paintings to frame and hang.
So how did you like
L.A. Weekly?
Following all the press coverage, private collectors had begun to inquire about snapping up
MBW pieces ahead of the opening, giving Thierry his first insight into the value of his work.
The Campbell's Soup with multi-ply colors.
Yeah, it's very nice, this one.
I would say $24,000.
"Scarface, " is it a big one?
Okay, cela $30,000.
Prepare me some canned olive paint.
Just listen to me.
I mean, make them work to do something.
There is nothing to do there?
There is nothing to do?
It's like gold, you know?
'Cause you spray, and, "How much is it?"
With his big day now upon him,
Mr. Brainwash still had plenty to do, because it was only now, just eight hours before the doors opened, that Thierry's paintings finally arrived, framed and ready to hang, almost 200 pieces in a riot of themes and styles.
I have never seen someone with so much goddamn art in one art show in my entire life.
I haven't seen group shows with that much artwork.
Whatever elves Thierry had making that stuff did a good job.
Outside, the first eager art fans were already starting to arrive.
We're here to see
Mr. Brainwash, bro.
He's holed in L.A. right now, bro.
He's up on every corner.
Come on, guys!
Let's make the show go on!
Fuck!
But inside, the pressure was starting to show.
Okay, okay, there is one thing, one thing, one thing.
We're gonna have a meeting.
One thing.
Starting with... starting now, this second,
I'm running the show.
You're not giving order to anybody right now.
I'm running the show.
You listen to me.
Okay?
Anybody's listening to me now.
Okay?
Okay?
So now you follow me.
You're coming with me.
This oil painting, do you know where is the two... the two-tone metal spray over there?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
You take off the two.
You hang down.
The right.
Right.
- Right. This wall.
- This wall?
This wall.
Okay, you show me, and I'll tell you a pile... a pile good or a pile not good.
You too.
This one, good.
This one, I'm not sure.
This one, good.
By mid-afternoon, a crowd of almost 2,000 people had amassed for what was now widely tipped to be the hottest art event of the year.
How'd you guys find out about this event?
L.A. Weekly.
Do you guys think you still have a shot at getting a print?
Yes.
I'm expecting to see a mixture of street art and pop art together.
Really interesting stuff.
Very modern.
No one's really done it the way he's done it.
You know, it's one of those kind of things, man.
I'm not quite sure what I'm in for, but I'm excited about it.
But Thierry was still finding distractions from the task in hand.
Who are you, and what do you do?
I'm Mr. Brainwash.
I was a filmmaker.
I mean, I am still a filmmaker, and... and I start filming,
I felt, like, because I love art.
Sometimes in life, you have to go... to go...
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.
Okay, can they unroll all the canvas?
Okay, I need you to just to take oil painting and put them in the small room.
Okay.
It's okay.
I can do another three minutes.
It's okay.
Eventually, with only three hours left to get everything ready, the crew started putting the paintings up on the walls themselves.
I brought in three of my staff members that have been here since 3:30 or4:00 working, hanging stuff, moving stuff, carrying stuff, you know, working just as hard as the guys Thierry brought in, realizing that, frankly, he's just kind of retarded.
Almost certain this is probably my last
MBW show I'll be working.
Finally, the doors opened to a public eager to feast their eyes on the grand debut of Mr. Brainwash.
What do you think of the "American Gothic "?
It's gothic.
It's a triumph.
It will go down in history.
I'm glad my friends turned me on to this.
There should be more stuff like this in Los Angeles.
They say that art is dead, but, sweetie, it's all around us.
Great.
Bravo.
It looks like it's sort of a one-trick pony, but I think if you look at it particularly in context as an entire body of work,
I think it's exploring some interesting notions around celebrity.
I never met the cat till tonight, but this fool's down for this, dog.
With over 4,000 people flowing through the venue,
Thierry's entrée into the art world was nothing less than a sensation.
Amazing.
Thank you so much.
Fantastic.
- Right on.
- Yes.
L.A.'s art fans watched, spellbound, as a major new star was born before their very eyes.
So desperate were they not to miss out on this cultural phenomenon, those left outside felt compelled to break through the gates.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
It's beautiful.
Keep on doing it.
Most artists spend years perfecting their craft, finding their style, and Thierry seemed to miss out on all those bits.
I mean, there's no one quite like Thierry, really, even if his art does look quite a lot like everyone else's.
I see this particular one reoccurring in so many different mediums.
Why does that one reoccur so many times?
Because I think it's part of the popular culture.
Andy Warhol passed away, and I'm here.
Can you guys form a straight line to the right, please?
But the ultimate validation was measured in dollars and cents.
By the end of his opening week,
Thierry would sell nearly
$1 million worth of art.
Mr. Brainwash had arrived.
One, two, three.
- Whoo-hoo.
- Yeah.
It was behind my expectation, like they say.
I would never thought that it would be so many people.
And it's not that it was so many people; they were so happy.
They were so pleased with what they see.
They were so... you know?
They were so touched.
Like, they caught me as Banksy.
Like, they said that I'm as good as that, you know?
So I love it, you know?
Somewhere it's great, but from the people,
I think I got accepted, you know?
It comes to a point that I got accepted.
Originally booked to run for just five days,
"Life is Beautiful " stayed open for a further two months, and as word about MBW spread, his pieces appeared in galleries and shows around the world, from Miami and New York to London, Paris, and even Beijing.
He's kind of the rightful heir to Andy Warhol, in a way.
Andy Warhol made a statement by repeating famous icons until they became meaningless, but he was extremely iconic in the way that he did it.
But then Thierry really made them meaningless.
How do I feel about being partially responsible for creating Mr. Brainwash?
I feel like, um...
I had the best intentions.
I think even when you have the best intentions, sometimes things can go awry.
To put a huge body of work together and sort of try to, you know, come out as if he is a fully formed artist ready for the world stage
I think was a little premature.
I feel good.
I feel good as an artist to have a reputation now.
You know, an artist is not a guy that you see in one show and you can decide who it is or if he copies Banksy or if he copies Shepard Fairey, if he copies... it's about time.
You'll see in the time who I will be, because with time, you'll see my creativity.
You'll see if I'm a real artist or not.
I do think that the whole phenomenon of Thierry's obsession with street art, becoming a street artist, a lot of suckers buying into his show and him selling a lot of expensive art very quickly, it's... anthropologically, sociologically, it's a fascinating thing to observe, and maybe there's some things to be learned from it.
I don't know what it means,
Thierry's huge success and arrival in the art world.
I mean, maybe Thierry was a genius all along.
Maybe he got a bit lucky.
Maybe it means art is a bit of a joke.
If Thierry can pull it off, then amazing, but, you know, it's kind of...
I think...
I think the joke is on...
I don't know who the joke's on, really.
I don't even know if there is a joke.
I don't think Thierry played by the rules, in some ways, but then, there aren't supposed to be any rules, so I don't really know what the moral is.
I mean, I always used to encourage everyone I met to make art.
I used to think everyone should do it.
I don't really do that so much anymore.
Some people, you know, might think that I'm a rabbit because I'm running around, and they think that I'm not organized.
But I said,
"Wait till the end of life, and you'll see if I'm a rabbit or a turtle."

Original message from Abramoff, Jack Why you'll want to make a documentary?
Nobody looks at documentaries.
You should make an action film.
CASINO JACK AND THE UNITED
STATES OF MONEY
Shooting was heard in the streets of Fort Lauderdale ...
... In February 2001. When the shooting ces ...
... The Greek tycoon Gus Boulis business opossum dead ...
... In what appears to be murder of the mafia.
The millionaire magnate is best known ...
... As the founder of the Miami
Subs restaurant chain ...
... And now as the former owner of SunCruz casino ships.
Dock the boat here but ...
The wealthy businessman in southern
Florida, 51 years ...
... Was killed by blood cold.
When Gus Boulis was killed ...
... I think it's the right word ...
... I remember someone made a joke ...
... Not quite understand at that time was:
"That will be really hard for Jack."
Jack Abramoff wears many hats ...
... A baseball cap to go today to the federal building in Miami King ...
... A fedora hat too large in Washington a few months ago ...
... And now this fudge is about to get in trouble ...
... From this afternoon in federal court in Miami.
He has pleaded guilty in a multimillion scam here ...
... With the purchase of the SunCruz casino ship in Fort Lauderdale.
I was not particularly interested ...
... To write about it at that point.
SunCruz was asked about ...
... And ah's when I really got nervous.
Abramoff and his partner,
Adam Kidan ...
... Have confessed to having swindled more than $ 40 million ...
... With that business to the lenders.
It became obvious immediately that it would be a much bigger issue ...
... Because he was too well known figure on Capitol Hill ...
... Truly an outstanding lobbyist ...
... Very extensive connections in both the Republican Party itself ...
... As the Republican Congress.
The government says Abramoff has admitted bribing ...
... 20 members of Congress.
Its activities were much more all legal lobbying.
Was the number one lobbyist in Washington ...
... Pruning contact the most influential members of Congress.
It's amazing How many members of Congress wanted to work with Jack.
Mr. President, if you say you have no fear ... ningn
When the story is reported ...
... President Bush tried to distance openly put Jack Abramoff.
Frankly, I do not even remember having taken a picture with the guy.
Suddenly, nobody remembered
Jack Abramoff.
- I do not know.
- Of course, Bush knows it.
Absolutely.
It's amazing how much managed to Abramoff and his people closer ...
... On the levers of power in Washington.
Tenamos no idea that this would lead to the resignation of Tom DeLay ...
... To Bob Ney's conviction ...
... Tony Rudy, Neil Volz.
There were so many people who fell on this network ...
Ralph Reed, John Doolittle ...
... Karl Rove, Dick Armey ...
... Conrad Burns, Don Young ...
... Grover Norquist.
It was all about money.
It is the U.S. sales.
The man who bought WASHINGTON
Who was this man,
Jack Abramoff ...
... It had bought in Washington?
Of where I left?
What were you looking for?
Was to influence, power or just money?
What was it that was bought and qu was what was sold?
There is more than blood, bones and the strength of this democracy ...
... That great men gave him the human race, that's all.
It has always been as ...
... Or something has changed?
We once more innocent ...
... Or just naive?
Abramoff is the story of a tale of personal corrupcin ...
... Or the story than what has become this democracy?
UNITED STATES SENATE
Das good.
In February ...
... The Commission began to investigate allegations of misconduct ...
... Submitted by six tribes indgenas against his former lobbyist, Jack Abramoff ...
... And former adviser to politicians,
Michael Scanlon.
Since our first hearing ...
... The insatiable greed of the lords Abramoff and Scanlon ...
... Country to the forefront.
Today's hearing is about something more than the contempt ...
... And even more than greed.
It is simply and sadly a case of betrayal.
Abramoff's case would be only ...
... John McCain accusing Abramoff had defrauded Indian tribes. l tena no idea then ...
... Of how much Republicans were to appear involved in that.
It began as something pequeoy became something much bigger ...
... And it was difficult to re-close the lid.
Melanie Sloan is a withdrawal tax ...
... Who now works for an independent watchdog of government.
We begin by carefully reviewing all campaign contributions ...
... Watching all that Jack Abramoff money they spent Bean ...
... And quines were associated with Jack Abramoff.
So it comes down to trace the money.
What interest at Sloan ...
... Was something that audiences ignored McCain:
The huge sums of cash that went to the Indian tribes ...
... At the hands of Republican politicians ...
... And its funds and organizations benfica favorites.
Jack aline with certain members of Congress that provides free access ...
... In exchange for cash.
Take the money from the tribes ...
... You can take as much as ytmalo so quickly as you can.
I make these politicians know that I will be ...
... The vehicle responsible for the delivery of this money.
I represent the access to money ...
... T represents access to power.
It is a perfect circle.
To make a perfect circle, all you need is cash.
Like most of the lobbyists, Jack
Abramoff understanding ...
... The main weakness of
American politicians.
To stay in power, ready estn traffic ...
... Free access and influence in exchange for money.
Jack thought that was a good thing.
The sale of the politicians was the free market in action.
IF I WERE RICH
Jack Abramoff was born in
Atlantic City in 1959.
His father tried his luck in the casino business ...
... And then he moved to Beverly Hills when Abramoff was 10 years.
Surrounded by the children of the film industry ...
... Jack was fanatic in high school movies Beverly Hills ...
... Where he also became active in student politics.
A tough competitor ...
Jack was a champion ... selected in the American football team ...
... And a weightlifting champion.
Pruning up about 232 kilos.
As a teenager, he rebelled against the secular habits of their parents.
Mixing a spiritual yearning with a cinematic imagination ...
... Decided to become
Orthodox judo ...
... After seeing "Fiddler on the Roof."
The judasmo is a conservative and traditionalist religion.
Therefore, the judasmo and eternal values ...
... Have little in common with modern American liberalism.
Jack found a way to link the religion with politics ...
... To become an orthodox conservative.
In business, in politics and national defense ...
... Believe that the law of the jungle was what should prevail ...
PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE

... It was uplifting to others as pruning l do the same ...
... And Ralph Reed.
A fanatic policy of the University of Georgia ...
... Ralph Reed was not interested in politics of compromise.
"I fought guerrilla style," he said.
"I painted the face and travel at night.
Do not you realize that over until you put a bag of dead bodies.
At the headquarters of the
College Republicans ...
... The favorite movie was "Patton."
They loved that general rhetorical war.
Impress your forzndoles field organizers to memorize ...
... The keynote speech of George
C. Scott in the movie ...
... But substituting "Democrat" with "Nazis."
- The Nazis ...
- "The Democrat is the enemy."
... Are the enemy.
- Atquenlos -. Atquenlos. "
- Shed their blood.
- "Spilled his blood."
- Disprenles the stomach.
- "Disprenles the stomach."
And That is the kind of rhetorical wearing ...
... To excite and enlist all young volunteers.
The membership skyrocketing.
Salan in the news.
They organized protests.
Buenos das, my name is Ralph Reed ...
... I am the executive director of Students for EE. UU.
They liked to be this kind of fake soldiers of fortune.
S, was dressed in fatigues ...
Think of Indiana Jones ...
... That's what these guys thought they were.
As those who estn and have been in Nicaragua ...
... Since the Sandinista Communists took power in that country.
They were very good at doing street theater ...
... And thus, for instance, burned effigies figures.
FRIENDS OF SOLIDARITY
Usually we build a
Berlin Wall wrong.
- Break down the wall.
- And then every year ...
...sal�amos con miembros del
Congreso portando mazos...
... And hacamos aicos the Berlin Wall.
And everyone asked: "Who are these guys crazy?"
They were conservative in the traditional meaning of the word.
Were radical, they were revolutionary university.
Overthrew the old order, and the old order was liberalism.
Jack Abramoff was elected president of the College Republicans ...
... And his assistant was Grover Norquist.
Grover Norquist is a graduate of Harvard with a master ...
... He sees the government as a necessary evil.
The bean entenday studied the
Russian revolution ...
Sac ... and lessons from it.
He veaas himself as a libertarian
Leninist right. antisovitico l was obviously ...
... But wanted to adopt the methodology
Leninist politics ...
... And using it to republican or libertarian causes.
Grover Norquist, of course, see the world in black and white.
There are good and bad.
Pensbamos only then it was one of those people paranoid.
He was fairly quiet, a born conspirator.
Tena records of your friends.
Tena dossiers on everyone.
Grover was not very sociable, but Jack Abramoff s. l hello everyone ...
... Was that he could get donors to open their checkbooks.
We accept money Democrat ...
... Republicans, Libertarians and independents.
If you know someone who can help, please avsenme ...
... Because we certainly need all the help we can get.
Who was going to give money to a youth campaign?
And when you have someone who has created a great organization ...
... Est recruiting that many people into POLITICAL ...
... But can not raise money ...
... Then going to find out how to do it by all means necessary.
The Foundation, as the American
Opportunity Foundation ...
... Estn covered by Article 501
(c) (3) for foundations ...
... The code of the General
Tax Directorate.
Jack and his fellow College
Republicans ...
... Occurred to them that may create a 501 (c) (3) ...
... A nonprofit organization ...
... And do the majority of your work as. And they did.
They called the founding of the United Students of EE.
States ....
... Or the United
Foundation. UU.
The United Foundation.
UU. is an educational organization ...
The organizations created under the laws of financing of campaigns ...
... Not to be politicians. And in fact s were politicians.
Despite warnings from
GOP lawyers ...
... Abramoff laundered the money through organizations POLITICAL benfica ...
... A tctica to redeploy years later.
Also spent much more ...
... Of the proceeds from the College Republicans.
Angered supervisors to borrow to buy ...
... Thousands of copies of a thriller antisovitica.
THE PUNZN
They all loved to read books on espionage ...
... And the book that opened my eyes was "Punzn."
It was then that we understand, for that stupid spy novel.
Soviticos then pull the strings ...
... And manipulate our politics domestics ...
... Like our common foreign ...
... And how Hacan it was with a committee of experts.
The right wing really believes ...
... That was how the soviticos as giving orders to the unwary here.
I serv.
I peel them.
And I'm about to get them ...
... The best podrn foothold they get in this country.
And it was the kind of anti-communism in which they create a kind of ...
Well, maybe the correct terms is "paranoid."
Ladies and gentlemen ...
... The president of the National Committee of the College Republicans ...
... Jack Abramoff, with the purpose of addressing the convencin.
Dmosle welcome Jack.
The party wanted me to give a speech in support of youngsters ...
Rejected ... and I write.
When I reach the podium, they see the speech in the teleprompter.
Republicans companions, I come before you today ...
... Representing American students ...
... The future of our
Republican Party.
And while I'm away from that speech ...
... And back to what I had written, which stored bean ...
... The kind of teleprompter was looking for what I was saying.
As the teleprompter screens go up and down.
The first experience politics of my generation ...
... Was an EE. UU. embarrassed by the situation of the hostages ...
... With no future load growth ...
... Or Democrat victories.
Suddenly, I felt a tremor beneath my feet.
They said they would bring down the floor and out of my ah.
As I cling to the podium ...
... Agarrndome as hard as I can and giving my speech.
And given today's students know ...
... That support for freedom fighters antisoviticos ...
... And the victory over Communism ...
... We guarantee the security of our nation.
Thanks.
The freedom fighter ...
... Was kind of exteriorizacin of who they were them.
So these guys idealized.
He talked about the freedom fighters of Nicaragua.
They are the moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers ...
... And the brave men and women of the French Resistance.
We can not turn away.
I was in college.
Haba beer, you know?
I did not care about this, but ...
They need to convey to the
American audience ...
... This idea of yours about the freedom fighters.
And not just about
Jack Abramoff ...
... This is something that is in the new right of this period ...
... This kind of cult of freedom fighter.
I have been active with Jack ...
... Battling communism around the world and stuff.
A few of us, and Jack was part of that group ...
... We had the idea of ...
... The summit of freedom fighters.
THE ROAR OF THE JUNGLE
As they organized this huge public relations event ...
... With all the freedom fighters ...
... From different theaters of action antisovitica ...
... Were the muyahidn, of course cons ...
... All in Central America, and met in Angola ...
Of all places, s?
In this corner of Angola ...
... Bean released Savimbi of Angola's communist government.
On the right new people really well Savimbi caa ...
... And one reason was because Savimbipareca embrace their ideology ...
... All the topics about: the free market, anti-communist paranoia.
Habrn thought: "This guy is one of us."
Was democracy versus communism ...
... And that was why colaborbamos with some unsavory characters.
Savimbi was a guy who was not exactly perfect.
The party UNITA of Jonas Savimbi was funded by Sudfrica ...
... Who was then practicing racial segregation.
We have the support of South Africa.
UNITA Rebel leader
Bean UNITA become famous for abducting thousands of children ...
... Agrcolas turn vast areas in minefields ...
... And kill their opponents politicians.
To build a new image.
We are a genuine freedom fighters.
He was a brilliant military commander, but a freedom fighter?
Not at all.
The man was a butcher.
U.S. President. States ....
... Must have something important and appropriate to say on this occasion.
My task was to try to get a message from Ronald Reagan.
He said: "Mr.
President, est heard about this meeting?
Have requested a letter from him.
He said, "No, Dana, there s nothing about it."
He continued: "They asked for a letter, you have envirsela."
"You have all the reason, Dana.
And I'll take care of this now."
"Sincerely, President
Ronald Reagan."
Signed democrticos principles ...
... And the leaders were given to guerrilla ...
... The Declaration of Independence of the United States ...
... And a tazn of George
Washington.
George Washington and his wife ...
... Used it in his home in Mount Vernon.
Chancellor of Reagan was furious ...
... For these independent efforts of the leaders for guerrillas.
Mr. President, there are other areas where you see ...
... That the organization can work with you SPECIFIC?
We must be realistic.
What can we do?
Realism was disappointing.
Billed as a festival of Woodstock antisovitico ...
... The documentary production of Jack Angola ...
... Pas is the budget and did not reach a large audience.
As Jack decided to make ...
... An action film. Scorpion RED
Jack us Sudfrica contacts in the racially segregated ...
... To launch your career as a film producer.
Ests crazy?
No. ..
Only I was out of bullets.
Vividly in the imagination of Jack ...
... Savimbi was transformed from a brutal dictator ...
... In a George ashington angoleo.
We must get out of here.
Let's give them a beating.
It's about espionage and counter ...
... A very abramoffiana vision of the world.
And then, of course, is all kinds of destruction.
At the height of the action ...
Dolph Lundgren ... has to perform a test of strength.
You must make a move for weight lifting.
Jack lifted weights in high school.
And Dolph Lundgren made a move to champions ...
Weight lifting ... and save the situation.
And the rebels swept the Communists out y.
... And hooray. Savimbi came to power.
The action film Jack offered a fictitious victory ...
... To American conservatives.
Preparbamos us to the real issue.
- You did it.
- Sure s.
THE REPUBLICAN revolution
In 1994 ...
... The Republican Party, led by Newt Gingrich ...
... Tom control of both chambers of Congress.
This was ...
... The Republican conservative revolution.
This is a truly historic night.
I mean, this is ...
I was an undergraduate ...
... And was a true believer in that whole Republican revolution.
Neil Volz arrived in Washington accompanied ...
... One of the new Members of the Republican revolution ...
... Bob Ney of Ohio.
The atmosphere was electrifying.
Tenamos the whole nation in a public outcry ...
... Because his was probably one of the most exciting elections more ...
... In the last 40 years of Democrat control ...
... Which I and others at the time ...
... Those that we were involved in politics, habamos says:
"No change in our lives."
And he did.
The Haban Democrat controlled
Congress for 40 years ...
Bean ... and some level of corruption that is installed bean ah.
So we unite against it.
And it is quite ironic that, years later ...
... I was going to be the face of a similar type of corrupcin ...
... For a totally different group of people.
When Newt Gingrich came to power, strong ties tena ...
... With two companions college
Republicans Jack Abramoff:
Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed.
Many people feel afraid of you and there is a date ...
I look scary?
It does not seem scary.
Seems to have only 18 years.
Ralph Reed is a man who lives by taking chances ...
... And always has. Always has been testing the limits.
He himself has said he was drinking heavily ...
... Smoking ...
... And then I found Jesus.
Reed discovered that the wages of sin ...
... Not be approached as lucrative as the wages of God.
In the years following his conversion ...
... The business of faith-based Reed ...
... Accumulated gains of more than $ 100 million ...
... Religious conservatives to deliver campaigns to politicians.
We will be the most powerful force in politics American politics.
The first is a grassroots strategy ...
He began his career with the
Christian Coalition ...
... Founded by televangelist
Pat Robertson ...
... To campaign against sex outside of marriage ...
... Gambling and abortion.
CHRISTIAN Coalition
Under Ralph Reed, the Christian Coalition became a center POLITICAL neurlgico.
Das good.
Estn happy to be in Washington?
For the Congress not to raise taxes vot ...
Beans also Grover Norquist promoted ...
... To the top of the Republican leadership ...
... By becoming a radical opponent of taxes.
I do not want to abolish the government ...
... I just want to reduce it to a size ...
... That could drag it to the bathroom and drown it in the tub.
To boost its antigovernment ideology ...
... Norquist helped start the Street Project K. ..
... With the mission to force lobbyists to Washington ...
... To become agents to raise money for Republicans.
As part of that campaign, the DC lobbying firms ...
... Were pressured to dismiss the Democrat ...
... And hire Republicans.
It makes sense.
You do not want to enrich and empower the opposition politics.
Y s wants to enrich and empower ...
... And politicians allied capabilities.
One of the leaders of the fight against taxes ...
... And the hidden taxes in the regulation, is Tom DeLay of Texas ...
In Tom DeLay ...
Norquist hall ... the man with the power politics to implement his vision.
- Member.
- Thank you, Grover.
The government has become too large.
At some point along the way ...
... The principle that the government works ...
... To serve the people was distorted.
The solution of DeLay was handing over to market forces.
Who would pay ...
... Pruning play.
Tratbamos to establish ...
... The differences between the two parties.
DeLay ration access to the
House Republicans ...
... According to the size of contributions to politicians.
Collect money for the party ...
... Pag them to its members according to what seems appropriate.
In each system there are people in charge of the money.
Tom DeLay was the Republican and the new majority.
The charge was the kind of money.
I'll give you this velvet hammer ...
Is pleased to be called
"The Hammer."
He was not the velvet hammer, was the steel hammer.
The money was crucial to build a leadership structure ...
... And who contributed were rewarded.
The lobbyists are the ones who need things from members of Congress ...
... And therefore is more likely that members of Congress ...
... Attend to ask lobbyists for campaign contributions ...
... As well as receive them by law.
And the law says that there should be links between the two ...
... But in doing DeLay that this system of "pay to play" ...
... Appear much more acceptable ...
... Paving the way for someone ...
... As Abramoff arrived and was so successful.
THE RETURN OF JACK
Abramoff abandon the production of film to become a lobbyist.
In the Washington Republican ...
... Jack was the right man at the right time.
His credentials with the conservative movement ...
... Gave him access and entry to new leadership.
E instantaneously saw what way may build a customer base.
And then, in turn, that customer base ...
... Leadership may support politically ...
... Through campaign contributions.
He became a kind of elationship simbitica.
The relationship became even more important as ...
... The costs of the campaigns began to go through the roof.
The cost of the campaigns went through the roof in the modern era ...
... During the last 35 years.
It is an amazing increase.
SENATE field cost
The problem is the new technology of politics:
Television commercials.
Surveys and discussion groups to design television commercials ...
... Are simply too expensive.
And ningn serious candidate or incumbent can say
"No, I will not do that", or "That est beneath my dignity.
I'm not going to get a commercial to 30 seconds.
Everyone does it.
One of the dirty little secrets that exist in Washington today ...
... Is how much time they spend members of the Chamber and the Senate each week ...
... Not just in election season, but all the time ...
... Throughout the year, talking on the phone asking for money.
The best-paid lobbyists help raise that money ...
... By which their customers expect a return on their investment.
On one occasion, a prominent lobbyist ...
... Arrived in my office with his client, seeking an assignment of funds.
An assignment of funds is an appropriation of cash ...
... Included in an appropriations act to channel money to his client.
Not 30 minutes after having left my office ...
... Call my campaign office ...
... Offering them organize a fund for m. recaudacin
This happens day after day in Washington.
A m I think the finance of campaigns ...
... Is a system of legalized bribery.
If you believe, as the HACA l ...
... That part of your job is to build a new elite Republican ...
... To control the city ...
... And yes, Jack was seen ...
... As a person who was going to be in that position ...
... That justifies you to do anything.
Ah is where you get in trouble ...
... Because I really think the laws do not apply here ...
... Because the goal is so important.
Jack knew that to achieve your goal, tena to get a man ...
... Tom DeLay.
Jack Abramoff was a committed conservative ...
... And was well known within the conservative movement.
And I treated with L equally to dealings with any other lobbyist.
Jack was not like any other lobbyist.
Tena a very special relationship with Tom DeLay.
I took a trip to Russia, Scotland, and the South Pacific.
Ensure that customers flood of money for the founding of DeLay ...
... And employed his wife.
And in exchange, DeLay Dej that Jack will be advertised as the same ...
... As the man one who had access to DeLay.
The first time I met with
Jack Abramoff ...
... Was in charge of discipline office of the majority in an event.
Jack is unique.
Jack Abramoff convenceraa a dog out of a butcher.
L As is persuasive.
He is the king of K Street
As is the type.
Arrive five minutes, sitting next to someone who is willing to spend ...
... Million dollars to lobby in Washington ...
... And last five minutes walk away.
And the man or woman believes that Jack is talking with the President ...
... But probably are playing solitaire on your computer.
And then returns and says: "Oh, sorry, but I give him two minutes more.
And By the way, I need about $ 250,000 a month.
And after that goes.
Is unique. Totally unique.
Probably I met Jack Abramoff ...
... At some point along with the College Republicans ...
... But there will not recognized on the street ...
Neil Volz ... until I presented it.
"It's a good guy," said Neil.
"A very powerful and is close to DeLay."
Never before has an individual ...
... Which has held firm to our principles ...
... Has risen as high as Tom DeLay.
Abramoff and DeLay share conservative principles ...
... Focusing on one simple goal:
Exterminate the rules and government regulations.
EL SANTO EXTERMINATOR
You know, when I started in this ...
... I was in control of food business.
Kill insects for a living.
It was a great experience for what ended up doing.
I was owner of a small business.
Smallest no business to kill insects.
When operating a small firm control of food near Houston, Texas ...
... DeLay was furious when the EPA forced him to stop using DDT.
From that moment, was determined to kill ...
... Any government rule or regulacin I could find.
Americans feel they have been bombarded ...
- ... With silly regulations ...
- My first nickname was "Desreg."
I wanted to "deregulate" everything.
I liked the free market.
It was a free market fanatic.
We are entering the silly little about regulations.
The Clean Air Act is a perfect example of that.
Well.
We're cutting the paperwork burocrtico.
I would like to eliminate the
Ministry of Educacin ...
... The Ministry of
Energy, HUD ..
... The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development.
I'd like to seriously reduce the Environmental
Protection Agency ...
... And other agencies such as OSHA.
The National Endowment for the Arts ... we have to delete them all.
DeLay was a "Desreg" full-time and off the job ...
... Addicted to parties, better known as "Hot Tub Tom" ...
... Be a man of 10 martinis a day.
I was a fool egocntrico.
Everything revolved around my career.
Almost destroyed my family.
Almost destroyed my marriage.
Drink too much, I complain too much.
In 1985, DeLay was reborn as he looked at James Dobson on TV.
If EE. UU. will survive ...
... Be because husbands and fathers
Founder, Focus on the Family ...
... Begin to make their families more high-level meeting its priorities ...
... And reserve some of their time, effort and energy ...
... To exercise leadership within their own homes.
I embodied the failure of parents that Dr.
Dobson is referrals.
And I began to mourn.
NEDA EST PAP?
In the course of weeks, get to know Christ ...
... Accept it as my Savior, completely changed my life ...
... Completely changed my approach and put it in the right direction.
The crusade "Desreg" DeLay left for a new adventure ...
... Abolish all limits of recaudacin and expenditure of campaign funds.
Some people believe that there are only a limited amount of money ...
... That the campaigns can turn to politics.
I do not believe for one minute.
We spend more money on chips today ...
... That what we spend in elections.
If we support the free market in everything else ...
... Why there will be no one, above all ...
... To support free market principles in the election campaigns?
It occurred to me a new way to raise funds ...
... Totally legal, since we are all within the rules.
DeLay helped develop the use of comits of political action, or "PACs"
Large centralized funds ...
... With fewer restrictions to raise and spend money.
If DeLay sabacmo distribute the money ...
... Jack Abramoff knew how to collect it ...
... Particularly if pruning sell access to DeLay ...
... To its clients and other members.
Abramoff knew that access to DeLay ...
... It was important also to Bob Ney,
Ney wanted since becoming ...
... Chairman of the committee of the chamber of deputies supervisor of elections.
Before 1994 ...
... The committee chairmen were very powerful representatives in Congress ...
... And often do not follow orders.
DeLay was the one who changed all that.
To start, the chairmen of the committees ...
... And not based solely on your antique.
Peaking at largely, if you were someone close to DeLay ...
... If what you hacas pedagogical and if you gave a lot of money.
The deputy changed its course ...
... Towards the recaudacin of money for the party ...
Recaudacin ... the money for other candidates ...
Because raising money to increase its hierarchy ...
... And prove that he was good for the party.
And, thus, may reach far SLAs.
Neil lights to indicate how I, one wants to stand out ...
... You want the chair of the committee ...
... And you need the support of Tom DeLay.
Attempt to circumvent the will and the rules of the Chamber.
That was the most important job for us.
It was ...
We focus on that as a laser.
And, Mr.
DeLay was the same, or those close to l.
.. ms
Tony Rudy, Mike Scanlon ...
Mike Scanlon, Tony Rudy ...
We knew that these relations would be crucial.
I am Michael Scanlon, Press Secretary Mr.
DeLay.
And he is Tony Rudy, our Chief Advisor.
These two employees of DeLay ...
... Relationships became key to Jack Abramoff.
Over time, contrataraa Rudy ...
... And become a member of Scanlon.
Jack also a close relationship developme ...
... With DeLay's chief of staff, Ed Buckham.
Even after having left
DeLay's office ...
... Buckham had a special influence on DeLay ...
... Because he was the minister in charge of staff discipline.
Buckham, like Jack, was a deeply religious man.
Those who attended his church evanglica ...
... Decan one who had the gift of tongues to be Posed by the Holy Spirit.
Also, like Jack ...
Buckham tena ... appetite for the good life.
Jack introduced him to this lifestyle.
Ed fell in love with golf, travel.
This was a way to conquer pruning Jack Ed ..
... Who will become his trusted ...
... As NMAs cementing his relationship with DeLay.
Tom DeLay is who all of us want to be ...
... When we grow up.
Well said.
It was a celestial alliance ...
... The born-again Christian and Orthodox judo ...
... United by their belief in the free market ...
... And the power of money.
Jack's special genius was to find money ...
... In places where no one else had thought to look.
TREASURE ISLAND
Land in sight.
What was it that led to Jack Abramoff ...
... Yams of 80 deputies and officials ...
... A mysterious chain of islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?
COMMONWEALTH OF THE NORTHERN
MARIANA ISLANDS (CNMI)
This U.S. territory appears to be a conservative paradise ...
... Close to the cheap asian labor ...
... And without being subject to many U.S. laws.
The Marianas Islands were an enchanted land ...
... To Jack Abramoff and Tom DeLay ...
... A place where business and the free market ...
... May evolve without rules or regulations.
The Mariana Islands are the Galapagos
Islands of free enterprise.
Before we invite the companies here ...
... Seem an Indian Reservation.
Depend entirely on the government ...
... Their society practically does not exist ...
... With high levels of alcoholism, high drug use ...
High divorce rate ....
It was just a disaster.
And the people decided to bring free enterprise.
And it worked.
The solution of free enterprise ...
... Was to exploit some loopholes created for special jurdicas Marianas.
Pruned local businesses clothing factories install ...
... Importing foreign workers ...
... Pay less than
MINIMUM wage ...
... And then ship the goods manufactured ...
... To the U.S.. UU.
Continental ...
... With the label
"Made in America."
It was a large gold mine.
If operated from Saipan ...
Bean ... no fees and pay workers pruning, then ...
... Dollars and coins as an hour.
EMPLOYMENT NON-US
More than 40,000 foreign workers ...
... Came to the commonwealth of Saipan ...
... Looking for opportunities.
Although the MINIMUM wage here ...
... Is less than the minimum of U.S. wages. States ....
... Remains an attractive payment ...
... For the people of the Philippines ...
... You may win a DLAR time ...
... Or the people of China who may earn less than that.
And so, properly administered ...
Situation ... it was a 100% profit.
The problem is that certain abuses
Tenan very significant place.
As U.S. immigration laws ...
... Were not applicable to all ...
... As the labor and wage laws were not applicable MINIMUM all ...
... Hacan to start seeing a perfect storm ...
... For those who would exploit that.
They went to Bangladesh and we discussed the commonwealth ...
... And that can lead us to Saipan ...
... And we can make money ...
... A lot of money ... earn about $ 1,000 a month.
As they each paid $ 7,000.
- And you recruited by ...
Tenan workers end up with huge debts ...
... And these debts are then subtracted from their wages by the employer ...
... And got them to the recruiter.
So basically they were semi-slaves.
- These are your pay stubs.
- S.
- But once you got money?
- Do not get money.
- You say you do not get paid?
- As is.
- And worked three months without pay?
- S.
Stories emerged about seven workweeks das ...
... And 18-hour days.
The records were comrades who escaped ...
... Who huan because of rape or beatings by foremen.
Some women were chained to their sewing machines.
A pregnant workers were pressured to have abortions ...
... So you do not lose their jobs.
Passports were confiscated.
They came here believing they would do ...
... A real contribution will the income of his family.
S many of them found employment in factories ...
... But others found something very different.
And so was that some of them were ...
... In the position to work as waitresses ...
... Waitresses and dancers became ...
... And then the dancers were asked to participate in prostitucin.
And so it was all downhill for these youngsters.
One hour. One hour.
The exploitation went on for several years.
Everyone preferred to look the other way ...
... Due to the influence of the garment industry ...
... Has had through the years.
Groups of human rights defenders began to investigate.
Secretly talked with workers ...
... Hacindose entrepreneurs go through ...
... And factories filmed with hidden cameras.
His reports led to demands, working fine ...
... And an attempt by Congressman
George Miller ...
Saipan ... to put under greater federal control.
There is a bill presented to the Chamber of Deputies ...
- ... To take control.
- And what will make if that happens?
Close the factory.
Protecting the Saipan factories of the rules and government regulations.
This was a job for sper lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
When I was governor ...
... Someone introduced me to Jack Abramoff.
Jack Abramoff was smart ...
... Maybe too smart for his own good ...
... But the fact is that he realized that we needed help ...
... In Washington, DC
We hired Jack Abramoff ...
... To lobby against immigration law.
They thought that Jack
Abramoff used to ...
... Was the best for direct connections tena ...
... With the office of majority leader, Tom DeLay.
And Tom DeLay ...
... Was someone who pruning influence sharee'ah for CNMI.
We were told that no one prune reach Tom DeLay ...
... Without going through Jack Abramoff.
And cost us millions of dollars.
For his services ...
... Abramoff and his firm,
Preston Gates ...
... Was charged to the Marianas more than $ 200,000 per month.
Part of the plan was to take guided tours to the Marianas Islands ...
... A conservative journalists and MPs friendly ...
... Like John Doolittle and Dana Rohrabacher.
We all take a look at some of the clothing factories ...
... That He had come here from various parts of the world ...
... To establish an operation there.
And am I thought it was working well.
What they did was to visit briefly in the clothing factories ...
... And out the front door of the factory, saying:
"Hey, nothing happens here.
We do not see ningn abuse.
As qu estn that mean? "
And what Hacan the rest of the time?
Rest and recreation.
Usually stayed at the Hyatt
Regency hotel, five stars.
Haba at least five golf courses at the level of competition.
At one point, Jack should have realized ...
... That is like selling as the Marianas Islands ...
... You know, with their abominable labor practices ...
... Basically a semi-slavery ...
... Is a more up peldao slavery ...
... But you take people there, and it's beautiful ...
... Have golf courses, beautiful hotels.
They fell into the trap.
We have been here a week now ...
... And I think the first-hand information to help us ...
... And maybe enlighten those that have not been ...
... Pressing in the right direction.
During the day, bean sports and games.
And at night, cocktails ...
... Cockfighting and clubs.
That's totally ridiculous
Mariana ...
... And find nothing Deputy ...
... That was like what have been described.
And to suggest that I support sexual slavery ...
... And the human traffic is ridiculous.
Member after member of Congress ...
... Was all, looked around and said:
"For me everything looks good."
And Jack Abramoff said,
"And I can help them."
As a special farewell gift ...
... Jack arrangement that some of the members on the tour ...
... Receive contributions to their campaigns ...
... Often from the owners of the factories.
The grateful members acted as the marketing team Abramoff ...
... Promocionndolo to their customers.
Permtanme this point at them, and how Washington works.
S had had a non-voting delegate ...
Am ... and had come to me: "I want to go to Saipan" ...
... I probably would not have been.
Instead, you or who has been to hire Preston Gates ...
... Hire people who know me ...
... And the system worked sabacmo to represent their interests.
To fulfill its power ...
... And their connections to
Washington, he told us:
"Wait.
I'm going to bring in Tom
DeLay." And he did.
Haba a sinnmero accusations.
I went there as guest of the government to see for myself.
I even went to see the principal defender of human rights on the island ...
... Can not remember his name, but he was a priest.
And he ped to show me a case of human rights abuse.
No bean none.
Could not show a single case.
All the lies that the liberals ...
... And George Miller said on the Marianas Islands ...
Ah ... did not because I seek them.
Congressman Miller was the only ...
... I really wanted to meet with workers.
As he came here and sat in my conference room ...
... When I tena my private practices with our translator.
And suddenly, I see the corner of my eye that the interpreter begins to mourn.
And so, as he tears were rolling down his face, I said
"You have to tell us what he said.
If you mourn is doing, you obviously need decrselo the deputy.
And she said he had him called
Miller to tell the deputy ...
... As it was a powerful man, and a federal elected official ...
... If you please pruning one of his kidneys buy ...
As ... to get money to return to China.
"You can buy my wheel?"
And I say, "No. .. no."
And he says: "Well, you can arrange the sale of my wheel ...
... So I can pay my debt and go home?
I mean, they were as of severely trapped.
DELAY COMES Signature Tan received the leader of the Chamber
While in Saipan, DeLay attended a party in your honor ...
... Hosted by Willie Tan ..
... The owner of the biggest clothing factory on the island.
I am very good friend of Tom DeLay.
And Tom said, "Willie, while we are in the command ...
... Podrn even see the light at the end of this tunnel. "
Willie Tan helps pay for travel of Members ...
... Arranges tours of the factories and sent hundreds of thousands of dollars ...
... To the founding
DeLay's private ...
... And the campaigns of President
Bush and other Republicans.
Jack Abramoff sought a way to frame the flow of money ...
... As a crusade for economic freedom.
To help spread the gospel ...
... Abramoff enlisted the services of his old friend,
Grover Norquist.
Thanks to Jack, the money from the clothing factories in Saipan ...
... Began to flow into the group of experts Norquist.
At the same time, Norquist began promoting the cause of the Mariana ...
... In his famous martials for Wednesdays ...
... For the GOP.
How are things in the Senate?
What we actually do to help?
Somehow, the Chinese factories ...
... In a U.S. territory in the Pacific ...
... Suddenly became a matter of free market.
And then when someone says
"Well, I always thought those sites in the Mariana ...
... Were China's maquiladoras,
"they reply," No ".
And not only disagreed with you, but they destroy you.
Money is not a bad thing.
Money is freedom of expression.
Money is intervention.
And while it remains open and transparent ...
... So that voters can see who is giving the money ...
... Est quin ycmo getting the money they spend ...
... Is a system that is extremely necessary.
Hello?
S. I'm on my way.
They saw a flourishing economy ...
... Saw a free market system ...
... What Tom DeLay said it was a test tube for pure capitalism.
But never met these women.
Never listened to their stories.
Never saw mourn.
Never saw the shame in their faces and the humiliation they represent.
So we went back trying to say ...
... As a minimum, we think that
Congress will change ...
... MINIMUM wage law ...
... And change the immigration law to protect these people ...
... But that does not occur in the Chamber of Deputies.
S, there was a problem five years ago.
But now we are forcing these employers to fulfill their contracts.
Each independent group that has considered this ...
... Has concluded that it is exactly the opposite ...
... Of what he is going on in the Northern Marianas.
What happened?
Well, now s what happened.
Do not fully understand at that time what was happening.
It turns out that the leader of the majority in the Chamber ...
... Tom DeLay, ran a business
PROTECTION ...
... To keep these people do business ...
... And his friend Jack Abramoff was their lobbyist.
I worked through Jack Abramoff with the government of the Marianas.
And he returned to put a stop to the
George Millers of this world.
It's very simple.
If ESTs as a leader, you can lift the phone ...
... And call the chairman of the committee and say
"This bill will not leave the committee."
As I said to Tom: "Olvdalo, Willie.
There is no chance."
And you know what he did?
Call the guy in charge of the committee est ...
... Named Don Young of Alaska.
- S, s fifth is.
- And he said: "Don ...
There is nothing wrong in CNMI.
I say you have to go all ".
Rep.
Don Young s trip to the Marianas.
The protesters confronted ...
... But Young remained impassive.
DeLay helps to block reforms.
His reward?
Thousands of dollars in campaign money ...
... And recaudacin of funds from Abramoff.
CNMI VE PANEL OF YOUNG HOPES
The Marianas were a machine to make money for Abramoff and DeLay.
Then suddenly, without warning ...
... His favorite governor lost his company to reeleccin.
The new governor cancel the contract as such as Jack.
CANCELLED
PLAYING AS Buckham
Faced with the end of the road in the Mariana ...
... Abramoff sought advice to the Minister personal ...
... And former DeLay chief of staff, Ed Buckham.
Buckham tena a reason to come to the rescue.
Thanks to Jack, Willie Tan
Bean helped fund ...
... The new Buckham's lobbying firm ...
... Alexander Group strategic purposes.
Buckham then went to work ...
... With DeLay press secretary
Michael Scanlon ...
... To arrange a local choice to ensure that Jack ...
... The return of your contract.
Buckham and Scanlon needed two men to change their votes.
His first target was Alejo
Mendiola, Rota Island.
Ed Buckham and Michael
Scanlon ...
... Came here to Saipan ...
... And I brought them to
Rota as a representative.
And brought to the airport.
Mendiola wanted $ 1.25 million for improvements at the airport.
The vot for the candidate of
Jack and the money appeared.
There follows, as part of a research trip ...
... Was the turn of Michael
Scanlon to turn a vote ...
... Offering more money from taxpayers ...
... Courtesy of Case Of DeLay.
DeLay Case Of sabacmo handle ...
... What Jack calls "the factory of favors."
It is a committee where members or collaborators SPECIFIC ...
... Have an incredible amount of influence ...
... And ability to spend a lot
SPECIFIC SPECIFIC locations.
$ 150,000 dollars from the factory for favors ...
... Appeared suddenly to finance a study ...
... Whether this bean is not to repair the breakwater.
In gratitude, a politician local ...
... Norm Parker, vot for the man in Jack.
There is more than politics to m.
One only hopes it is not illegal.
We do not s.
S. But I think it is illegal.
Money performs its magic.
Jack's friend, Ben Fitial was elected
President of the Chamber.
And Jack received his contract again.
There were two senators who switched their votes ...
... For projects in the islands.
Got something to change their votes?
Not s.
- But were you involved?
- I never say anything.
Gave some Tom DeLay's office?
Not s. ..
... Nor shall know.
You may not?
Fitial had him singing the "happy birthday" to Tom DeLay ...
... In the office of disciplinary officer of the base.
Firm an email to Ed Buckham as
"your adopted brother, Ben."
Fitial also ensures that Buckham ...
... Obtain a contract for energy in the Mariana ...
... For a special client of DeLay's district ...
Enron.
The unifying factor?
Jack Abramoff.
Let me tell you about
Jack Abramoff.
What he has done after he left the Northern Mariana ...
... I can not approve it, okay?
I mean, obviously did something wrong because he was convicted.
And, according to understand, est now in jail.
But Let me tell you ...
... Mr. Abramoff did what we hired him to do.
No l. ..
... This commonwealth will not be what it is today.
Today the garment industry has practically abandoned Saipan.
The new international trade agreements ...
... Have eliminated the gap jurdica of the Marianas.
The owners of the factories are gone ...
... In search of cheaper labor than their money can buy ...
ATRS leaving environmental disaster ...
... Uprooted immigrants ...
... And a white slave prspera.
As capitalism is when you let it loose.
That's why we have a regulatory status ...
... And when you remove those regulations ...
... As they claim to lobbyists like Abramoff ...
... Which are the Marianas.
OUTPUT
The betting game indgena is highly political.
It's an industry worth
$ 18 billion.
As in the Mariana ...
Indian business ...
Jack built ...
... Around a lagoon jurdica:
A 1988 law granting the right to have casinos on tribal property.
Tribes successful as ours must have the help ...
... Skilled and honest professionals who understand ...
... The business and politics of the game by betting indgena.
To protect their profits on bets ...
... Tribes turned to the man who convinced the bean ...
... That had a lot of influential people in his pocket.
I, George Walker Bush, do solemnly swear ...
... To run the office ...
... President of the United
States faithfully ...
... With the help of God.
Congratulations, Mr. President.
Jack bean muchsimo raised money for Bush ...
... And convinced his tribal clients to contribute no money ...
... His chief rival politicians,
John McCain.
In 2001, Abramoff asked to bring ...
... Your practice to the same lobbying firm ...
... Bush Bean hired to win the battle of the count in Florida:
Greenberg Traurig. BUFETE
Clearly, l tena great exercise:
Five or six million dollars ... the Marianas, the Choctaw of Mississippian ...
... I think the Coushatta of Louisiana.
I was making a great effort by the Saginaw Chippewa.
How can I help this tribe?
Any fee you pay us back multiplied.
Last year, I think that the fees of the Choctaw were, I think ...
... As $ 3.5 million lobbying payments ... and then he came back they were
$ 120 million dollars ...
... In direct or indirect federal aid, scholarships, etc ...
Suddenly, Jack was a popular man in Indian country.
And also it was Grover Norquist.
The Indians were provided with a cover politics ...
... Defining the casinos as enterprise zones.
In return, Jack makes sure that the tribes ...
... Donate money to the committee of experts from Grover.
I would like to work directly with the Indian nations.
There comits working state ...
... Demonstrating why should not increase taxes.
Ralph Reed also wanted a part of it.
Withdraw their money from the
Christian Coalition ...
... And staked his reputation on a new adventure to make money.
I will form a new company called
Century Strategies.
"Century Strategies" ...
... A consulting firm with a powerful grassroots network ...
... Jug an important role in the business ...
... Of Indian casinos Jack ...
... Working with a tribe ...
... To close the other gaming operations.
The Louisiana Coushatta were one of their major clients.
This is a small tribe of several hundred people ...
... Having a very successful casino that generates $ 300 million a year.
And protective of their territory.
Former Journalist
The Coushatta hired
Jack MUCH MONEY to prevent another tribe, the Jena Band ...
... Operacin open their own casinos.
Worldwide SOAD, they disappear.
They are not enemies.
You are left with their customers, instead of them having their own.
In our view, always go after the dream.
If pudira shake a magic wand ...
... And get what Quisiro, what is it we want?
The plan that we suggest to ... and, in fact, we delight to work with you .. and had great success when working with religious conservatives.
Return to work with them ...
... And we will concentrate on the real enemy.
United States is experiencing a moral crisis ...
... And needs to address what we believe is ...
... One of the great cancer that grows ...
... In the U.S.
OLITICAL body ...
... And this is the epidemic of legalized gambling, which now ...
And this is a man who claims to be against the game ...
... And yet it receives payments from these tribal casinos ...
... To close other casinos ...
... Not because I want to close casinos ...
Estn ... but because he paid incredibly well for it.
But Reed will look bad to receive money from the casinos ...
... So Jack diverted part of the gambling money to travs Grover.
And Grover grabbed his commission.
The company Century Strategies receive as Reed nearly $ 6 billion Indian gambling money.
And he was paid to another organization travs ...
... With one or two entities in between, lobbyist, consultant Carlyle ...
... That Ralph could claim ignorance.
Ralph Reed Abramoff made ...
... Not only oposicin PUBLIC ride this plan ...
... But to pressure members of Congress ...
... Who in turn pressured the
Ministry of Interior ...
... To prevent the Jena tribe opened a casino.
For us it was very interesting indgena territory ...
... When he came a letter signed by many members ...
... Interior Ministry saying:
"Please stop jena what the band tries to achieve."
The majority of the deputies who signed the letter oponindose the Jena casino ...
... Received campaign money from casinos ... competitors.
JACKPOT JACKPOT JACKPOT
In the end, jena lost.
The jena did not get their casino.
And Abramoff gan and defended the interests of their clients, the Coushatta.
Jack tribal money us by customers indgenas ...
... As a power to send more than $ 5 million ...
... POLICIES causes and candidates, mostly Republicans.
Some of the major recipients were Bob Ney,
Tom DeLay, John Doolittle ...
JD Hayworth.
Patrick Kennedy
Conrad Burns.
Jack Abramoff had a lot of ability to convince ...
... Many tribes indgenas or companies ...
... Donate all money ...
... Political parties and candidates as you like.
Y s, Jack Abramoff was a great machine to make money ...
... A major money-making machines in the city.
THE MONEY MAKING MACHINES
Wherever we were, if he mentioned the name Jack Abramoff ...
... All quin Saban era.
The taxi driver who took ...
... Mention to Jack Abramoff ycmo was a man.
He is a man with much power and connections, especially on the right.
Often receives calls and deca:
"Tom DeLay is," Is
Karl Rove "...
... Or something like that.
Who was, you know, important ... the White House.
U.S. President. UU.
I remember being at a dinner where
Neil Volz was sat at my table ...
... Seal or he said: "Jack be in the pavilion ...
... With the President tonight
"at a Republican gala.
And when Jack Abramoff was mir ... all up.
It gave the feeling that pruning do what I want ...
... Because all the right people is at its pocket.
Abramoff look like this awesome figure ...
... Not only as a lobbyist, but as a restaurant owner.
Jack tena a motto for his restaurant:
"Serving in a conservative liberal."
If you were a Republican ...
... "Signatures" was the fashionable place any night of the week.
And trouble getting a drink there.
You should move to Bush aides.
Creme, everyone was at the bar ...
... Taking the best.
And where would Neil Volz and his friends.
In "Signatures" can enter, and they treated us like royalty.
And it was very, "Hello, Mr.
Volz" this or that ...
Free drinks, free food to pass pruning your friends.
I saw Jack at lunch ...
Blackberries ... two ... one in each hand ...
... And your computer with
Internet inalmbrica.
HACA it all from a table in a corner of the restaurant.
And obviously is their restaurant ...
... So you have to ... across Rome to reach the Coliseum ...
... And he is Csar.
Abramoff it also had four luxury suites in a stadium ...
Tena ... and an assistant ...
... Whose main job ...
... Was to provide tickets for these luxury suites ...
... Who were members of Congress and their aides.
Such a huge suite at
FedEx Field ...
... Right in the middle of the stadium, was dazzling.
Jack had all the tools in the toolbox of lobbying. l won the role of lobbyist.
When it rains the millions in Greenberg Traurig ...
... The firm Abramoff gave extraordinary freedom ...
... Folded many of its rules and made special concessions ...
... For Jack's unique relationship with a former aide to Tom DeLay,
Mike Scanlon.
Dej Scanlon, DeLay's office ...
... And immediately saw him as someone ...
... Very close to Jack.
They were always planning, always were plotting.
In a way, were like a version of
"The Producers" on K Street
"A few weeks ago I mentioned something.
I tom the concept ...
... And devise a plan to generate money. "
GIVE ME FIVE
"I love how you talk, bitch cretin.
As soon as you grip on the court ...
... Llorars as a child. "
"We'll see, puto."
"By the way, you're all a stallion in this effort.
Quiz have a situation of give me five.
"Thank you.
The organizing super step give me five."
Abramoff and Scanlon devised his plan to "give me five" in a racquetball court.
This was a bribery scheme ...
... Where tribes indgenas
Jack hired by high fees.
But Jack also said:
"If you really want to be effective in Washington ...
... Need basic skills ...
... And the man who can give them those skills base ...
... Is my old friend,
Michael Scanlon. "
The majority of the money went to Scanlon's firm.
Without the tribes' knowledge ...
... About half of that money went back to Jack Abramoff.
"Remember, we promised during dinner with the boss ...
Haramos ... that the most powerful in the state.
More money. Give me five. "
"We increased the $
2.1 million to $ 5.
We need a real gimme five. "
It seems that Mr.
Abramoff and Scanlon convinced the tribes to pay ...
... Grossly inflated fees to the companies of Mr. Scanlon.
In the end, both men were individually ...
... At least $ 21 million in revenue.
In Washington ...
... The huge fees to lobbyists
Jack enraged rivals ...
... Which began to leak information ...
... Sue Schmidt, the
Washington Post. "
Call me a well-known Washington lobbyist, a Republican.
He said: "You have to investigate
Jack Abramoff.
Represents these tribes indgenas ...
... And charged millions of dollars ...
... And working with this young man, Mike Scanlon ...
... I went out Staff of Tom DeLay.
And Scanlon est ... you know ...
... Experience as a sultn. "
A seller irresistible
Scanlon became the man Jack ...
... Campaigns to sell policies of the tribes indgenas base.
What we have is a database of latest generation ...
... A database base politics.
Say, for example ...
... We had a problem with a particular senator.
Say you want to make sure someone does not win.
May not have enough to get our candidate ...
... Secured enough votes to win ...
... But we can certainly prevent someone elected.
Policy of Scanlon's work paid off.
Only a couple of years after leaving DeLay's office,
Scanlon flying private planes ...
... Europeans were dressed in costume as ...
Adquirams ... and $ 20 million in real estate ...
... Including a large residence in Rehoboth Beach ...
... That belonged to the Dupont bean.
This beach town also was the site of the greatest invention of Scanlon:
A committee of experts called AIC
DGamer how all this started, Mr.
Grosh.
You was a friend of Mr.
Scanlon or?
S, I know Mr. Scanlon ... go ... since he was 14 years.
And I understand that background ...
... Are very honorable, as a lifeguard.
- Right?
- Among other things.
THE COMPANY OF LIFELINE
Scanlon, something that surprised ...
... Tena muchsimo money working with Abramoff ...
... But still ...
Even during the scandal ...
... In the summer of 2004 ...
Continue working in Rehoboth
Beach lifeguards.
He loved being a lifeguard.
His full name is Michael
Patrick Scanlon Shawn
Or Michael PS Scanlon,
"PS" means "pure sexy."
Scanlon, ready to go?
All you, man.
Mr. Grosh, you were appointed director of the AIC
And what happened? l sb faced him so?
- By phone.
- And you say?
"You want to be at the forefront of international Corporacion?"
And I re.
And I said, "Okay ...
... What is needed?
What I have to do? "
And answered: "Basically, nothing."
As I said, "Well, sure." And so was the beginning.
Was surprised when all this ... began to uncover information that you was director ...
... An internationally respected expert committee?
I'm not qualified to run a refrigerator ...
... Let alone a committee of international experts.
"Based in sunny Rehoboth
Beach, Delaware ...
... AIC staff used technology of XXI century ydcadas of experience ...
... To make the world a more small.
American International
Center, AIC is a researcher Foundation
POLICIES public "...
"That was launched in early 2001.
The website of American
International ...
... Describe the mission with great terms:
'Est AIC determined to influence ...
... Global paradigms in an increasingly more complex.
In summary, the AIC rene to great minds from around the world '.
What I can say "I feel flattered.
AIC HACA Qu?
The whole time I was involved ...
... Rented the first floor of a house ...
... And install a computer.
His office was ...
... In the lower floor of the house where I live.
Something does not seem very good about it.
When I discovered, first ...
... Involving the game and indgenas ...
... All the same I knew that something will cause problems.
Open an account for Make all checks payable to:
American International Center.
American International Center
And the figure ... I do not ...
S it was a six-figure amount, not very high, and that ...
I never had seen a check in my life as ...
... So that ... really scared me.
Of where is this money?
Y. ..
... In such quantity.
Part of the money came from casinos indgenas ...
... And Ralph Reed would ...
... To hide the fact that the punters will pay.
Other money came from other countries ...
... And went to Abramoff's firm, Greenberg Traurig.
There were signals, it seems, at first, that bean problems.
And one of the first things was when I enter habamos added that a new customer ...
... It was this committee of experts ...
... I was in the East Coast ...
... Which was directed by a lifeguard.
At that time, I knew.
And then suddenly I realized ...
... That was not the customer.
The client was in fact ...
... The government of Malaysia.
Tratbamos to hide something?
Certainly think so.
Today the Jews rule the world by proxy.
They get others to fight Prime
Minister of Malaysia ...
... And die for them.
The Malaysian government tena an image problem.
The Malaysians were very interested in hiring.
The ambassador was a friend of mine and asked me ideas.
He said they were talking to some companies ...
... And I told him Jack. Costume
Ambassador Greenberg Traurig.
We had many meetings.
And eventually ...
... That became a contract with Malaysia ...
... To be represented by Greenberg
Traurig, and Jack.
By law, we assume that Jack and Greenberg Traurig ...
... To register as lobbyists for a foreign government ...
... But Jack find a way to avoid it.
Malaysians sent money home to AIC in Rehoboth.
Dave Grosh then sent the money to Greenberg Traurig.
The PURPOSE?
Getting a meeting with
President Bush.
The ambassador then one question:
"Widespread get the invitation to the Prime Minister?"
And I respond: "Well djem ask Jack."
And Jack responds:
"We worked on it."
Jack worked on it Through his former secretary, Susan Ralston ...
... That became a special assistant to the President under Karl Rove.
Susan worked for Jack for over two years ...
... And so, when he came to the White House ...
... Of course it was a great help.
On one occasion, was sitting with Jack ...
... And he received a call.
He said: "It's Karl.'s
Karl Rove."
And he said a few words.
I hung up and said:
"Call the ambassador, got the invitation."
I'm pretty sure that this visit will be very fructfera.
Thanks.
I too. Thanks.
The signing of Jack received $
1 million from Malaysia ...
... Be delivered to the President of the United States.
Jack delivers hundreds of thousands of dollars ...
... Campaign cash to the President.
That made him a welcome visitor at the White House ...
... As confirmed these photocopies written ...
... Delivered by the Bush administration ...
... By court order.
PREPARE AVIN, CAIRO
"Prepare the plane, honey, we're going to El Paso."
"Prepare the plane, honey, we're going to El Paso."
That refers to quiz ...
... The campaamscnica involving the tribes involved.
Jack gave him a code name to the intrigue:
"Operacin Open." l planned to sell its services to a tribe of Texas ...
... Whose casino had just closed.
DEJA TIGUAN CASINO PROFITS
TO 450 EMPLOYEES
Soon afterwards to close the casino ...
... Jack Abramoff and Mike
Scanlon appeared.
It was as if we were ledo mind.
Saban ycmo do exactly what to do.
Lieutenant Governor Carlos Hisa was freshly selected ...
... Of the Tigua tribe of El Paso, Texas.
He was the man designated to work with Jack Abramoff ...
... To try to reopen the casino of the tribe's Speaking Rock ...
... That Bean was closed by a state campaign antijuego.
Before its closure ...
... The bean casino generated $ 60 million a year in revenue ...
... That Habanos helped lift the tribe out of poverty.
Everyone has an nterpretation ...
... We receive this money and we are rich ...
... But the money we receive from the game ...
... Is only to provide Basic
Services for our people ... with respect to housing, educacin ...
... And PUBLIC HEALTH.
The plight of the Tigua,
Abramoff saw an opportunity ... a new client indgena desperate need for help with politics.
In a term of three months paid $ 4.2 million?
- S.
- did not seem ridiculously exorbitant?
No. We explained that the money needed to be paid ...
... So that our efforts could continue y. .. it was my first year as lieutenant governor.
Tena no idea of how everything worked in Washington ...
... And Abramoff, as the expert ...
... Said: "As is done all the time.
As things are done in Washington.
What the Tigua did not know was that Jack Abramoff ...
... Bean bean was the one who helped to close in the first place.
Indgena paid for the game in Louisiana ...
... To close the casino of another tribe in Houston
Jack and Ralph Reed deceived religious groups ...
... To mount an attack antijuego media throughout Texas.
Game lobbyists in Austin trying to legalize ...
I call on behalf of Citizens
Against Game.
The Tigua were c llateral damages.
The amount of bean oposicin that religious groups ...
... The Christian Coalition and others who tried to shut us down ...
... It was huge.
And they were successful.
I deeply resent the accusation that closing the Tigua casino.
I do not cerr ms, frankly ...
... Anyone else involved in the effort in Texas to achieve it ...
... Including the governor and attorney general.
When Attorney General John Cornyn order closing the Tigua casino ...
... Abramoff sent him a campaign contribution will of "well done".
Texas Dej it clear tonight that we need a new administration ...
... In the U.S. Senate. UU.
Although Jack and Ralph
Reed supporters ...
... Closing the Tigua casino in the hands of Cornyn
Jack told the tribe that indignant.
To correct a wrong, Jack pruning not support taking money for s.
Scanlon ... but will have to pay.
Using the scam of "give me five"
Scanlon secretly shall be shared nearly $ 4 million with Jack.
In a term of three years,
Abramoff and Scanlon ...
Haban ... they billed the tribes
$ 82 million.
Several dissident members began asking questions ...
... About anger adnde money.
In Indian Territory, I have seen many swindlers in history.
Tenan few of them so skillfully as Mr.
Abramoff and Scanlon.
These DC were hired lobbyists ...
... And very soon came the theft of tribal treasure.
For when completed in 2004 ...
... The bean tribe spent about $ 36 million.
INDIAN FIGHTS
David Sickey est in the Coushatta tribal council of Louisiana.
By monitoring the operations of a casino of $ 300 million
Sickey came to power as a result of its investigation ...
... Of the tribe's dealings with Jack Abramoff.
In reviewing secret documents tribal
Sickey discovered that Abramoff ...
... Bean convinced the tribe to spend nearly $ 35 million ...
... Lobbying and payments to politicians.
Saban them half that
I was sniffing ... he drew secret documents and copies ...
Invoicing, records, canceled checks ...
... Anything having to do with Jack.
To try to understand what happens,
Sickey began to share information ...
... With dissident members of other tribes ...
... And a lobbyist indgena,
Tom Rodgers.
And proceeded to exchange information ...
... For example, Bernie Sprague with the Saginaw Chippewa ...
... Told me that checks sent a. ..
... 611 Pennsylvania Ave.
And l think that was a huge office building.
I said, "Bernie, packaging million dollars to a store."
Tom a picture and sent it.
And the same with David.
They sent me all your bills.
"Enven all funds." Enven $ 1.8 million.
Here is a perfect example ...
... Of invoices sent to the tribe.
It's a $ 3 million ...
... For "professional services", whatever.
When the dissidents began to understand what happens ...
... They began to leak information to a local journalist.
That made me feel good ...
... Because only field I am a journalist here in Louisiana.
And I try to compete with journalists from city ...

It is very rare to get any internal documents of the tribe ...
... And much more than the leaders tribal ...
... Deliver these documents voluntarily.

"ARMPAC" and "TRMPAC."
What possible influence may have the Coushatta of Louisiana ...
... By sending money to people in states like Wyoming ...
... Such as Nevada and places?

Then the connection was always Jack Abramoff.

"Hopefully these gross Tigua were more intelligent ...
... Contributions in politics.
I would love to get your hands on that money.
"Oh, well, the stupid are eliminated."
"The stupid are eliminated" ...
That means that we were stupid to contribute ...
... The Democrats and not Republicans ...
... And that's why our casino doors closed.
There are a stack of potential opportunities.
There are 27 tribes ...

SunCruz was one of many ideas.
Jack wanted to create a platform.

This is good.
It's really good.
I hibernate for eight months.
Telephone mattresses-for-all
They're always
The opportunity arrived for
Kidan and Abramoff ...
... When the U.S. government forces the Greek owner of SunCruz ...
... To sell its fleet not a U.S. citizen.
The SunCruz casino owner
Gus Boulis ...
... Has struggled lately, ...
... But Boulis is a shrewd businessman ...
... Who is not known to give up.
Someone should challenge the business?
There is nothing to question.
We ... have ... It's going very well.
Almost too good to be true.
They had trouble dealing with Gus Boulis ...
... Even before it closed the deal. l wanted to be a consultant
Former Journalist ...
... And incorporated all these demands of the treatment last moment.
Scanlon then, by then working for Abramoff ...
... Resorted to Bob Ney and made Bob Ney ...
... Include something in the congressional record ...
... Where basically denounced
Gus Boulis.
When Neil Volz brought me ...
... Consideration. I said,
"What is this?"
He said, "It came from
Mike Scanlon."
Neil asked: Deputy
"Cul is my ... my connection with this?"
Tena not necessarily much to do with our congressional district ...
... But esperbamos reach
Tom DeLay ...
... To travs of certain people close to l that are lobbyists ...
... To help them with their private interests.
And it was one of the first moments ...
... Where you really feel that feeling in your stomach ...
... As saying: "It s okay?"
And get on with it.
Then a congressman from
Ohio complaint ...
... A floating casino owner in Florida ...
... By the way of anything, you know.
Neil am ms later he came back and said:
"Gus Boulis call our office absolutely furious."
The sea of fright.
Indeed it did.
I really feel bad.
And I made the deal go ahead.
When they tried to close the deal ...
... There was a very protracted negotiation with the bankers.
And amid all this,
Kidan and Abramoff have this banker ...
... To Abramoff's private suite at FedEx Field ...
... For the Redskins game.
And that night he tena to
Tom DeLay in the suite.
DeLay was there and the bankers knew DeLay.
And I think obviously they were very impressed ...
... And the deal is closed.
Are arranged to buy it for $ 147 million ...
... And do not put the money into it msmnimo.
In fact, they made a transfer of $ 23 million ...
... He presented to the bank ... forged documents ...
... Showing that Habanos invested
$ 23 million in the deal.
Went to Kinko's and created ...
... A false transfer ...
... Scanning a real transfer then modified.
- What said you?
- I think I said:
"It looks pretty good."
A m I feel real.
The deal took place.
Adam Kidan and Jack Abramoff Tenan now a business of floating casinos.
Neil Volz am then went back a second time ...
... And said that ...
Gus ...
Gus Boulis bean out of this business.
And we put a second request for congressional record. he asked me to do it and I did.
The Gaming Industry
The second deca: "There is need for research.
Now you are in the hands of a great citizen "... that was me.
The reference was also very ridiculous ...
... Because he spoke of the honorable man who was Adam Kidan.
Adam Kidan will be prohibited from exercising the abogaca Haban ...
... In New York for fraud.
As that he was not the kind of honorable person ...
... That Ney was postulated.
While he makes these statements ...
... In the congressional record, he received campaign contributions ...
... Adam Kidan, Jack Abramoff and Abramoff's wife, Pamela.
Neil said there will be $ 1,000
$ 2,000, $ 3,000? No.
Receive contributions? S.
Look, if I can make happy Scanlon ...
... And he 's close to DeLay, at some point in the future ...
... Call Mike Scanlon and say:
"You know, I am running for this ...
... I am running for that. We have the support of DeLay?
"Of course s.
Haban given us a check ...
I think it was $ 10,000 ... for the Republican campaign committee of Congress.
And we gave it to Ney ...
... To receive points for that.
Simply coincided ...
Seriously ... by coincidence ...
... That it gives the second ...
I left the second congressional record.
That was quid pro quo?
I guess as you can llamrselo.
Meanwhile, Gus Boulis refused to accept the new owners.
I'm very proud of the good employees.
Gus does not want to leave ...
... And still appear on the boats as their own.
Habamos tried to mediate these issues.
Once we had a meeting at the office ...
... And said, "Listen, if we can not solve this ... demndame."
And his answer was: "Do not sue, kill you."
Salt across the desk ...
... Tom a pen and began to apualarme with it.
In December, the new owner of SunCruz casinos ...
... Restriction sac an order against Boulis ...
... After this one allegedly attacked him, apualndolo with a pen.
The Restriction of Kidan order result being irrelevant ...
... When Boulis was killed in an assassination-style mafia.
Boulis was murdered in
Fort Lauderdale ...
... About the same time he sold his empire of SunCruz Casinos.
Abramoff and Kidan were indicted by the SunCruz casino deal.
For a long time, the police wanted to question the do ...
Tenan ... to see if any information about the murder.
They arrested several people in the case ...
... Including Anthony
Moscatiello ... the counter of the
Gambino family ...
... That Bean was istered by Adam Kidan as a consultant for banquets.
As testify and cooperate actively in the case Moscatiello ...
... I will not go into much detail, but it s dir:
I am related to the mafia? No.
Conocaa people for association to raise me in the neighborhood?
S.
But Jack's father always boasting of having links with the mafia ...
Jack Bean boasted of it because the connection to Atlantic City.
That surprised us on the SunCruz deal ... what was so incredible ...
... Was that had these elements of organized crime ...
... In such close proximity to Tom DeLay.
It was not only the mafia.
Abramoff and DeLay sent
Buckham Russia ...
... On a trip paid for by a mysterious pair of oil executives ...
... Called Alexander Koulakovsky and Marina Nevskaya.
With connections to intelligence operatives ...
... They traveled by limousine with bulletproof glass ...
... And guards armed with machine guns.
Abramoff ended up getting to the point ...
... Working for a Russian company. Director,
Institute of World Politics
It is a very dubious company of which an there is not enough ... do not know much about it.
But SA is the Russian company that delivered the cash Millan ...
... To Dulles Airport travs ...
... To the founding of DeLay's chief of staff ...
... Just outside the Capitol.
Everything was directed from Russia ...
... To a company travs front in Nassau.
Abramoff also uses the Russian military connections ...
... To explore planet gear used to search for petroleum in Israel ...
... And find with night vision and camouflage ...
... Sniper schools in the West Bank.
The money came from casinos indgenas ...
... Spasm Russians ...
... Owners of maquiladoras Chinese and Malaysian politicians.
I think probably it was one of the ways in which l understand ...
... What HACA as a lobbyist. Author
It's very similar to what law in these novels spasm.
But think about what the spasm.
In the real world, what does the CIA?
The main thing is manipulate the opininpblica.
In many ways, what HACA l ...
... Was very similar to an operation in the style of the CIA.
OPEN OPERACIN
All est. Hello, Neil.
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
In 2002, Neil Volz accepted an offer from Jack Abramoff ...
... To leave the Congress and join Jack Greenberg Traurig.
What do you think you're going to draw more?
S. .. not being in the middle of everything.
I think being outside looking in some of the important issues.
Ajvenes recruit very bright indeed ...
Scanlon, Neil Volz ms that were later ...
Capitol ...
... Where Haban been in leadership positions with people ...
... That takes real decisions on the Republican side of Congress.
And how does it feel? Been to Rep.
Ney ...
- ... For a long time.
- S.
If I am a contributor to the camera and make $ 50,000 a year ...
... And after two years I can go to work to a firm of lobbyists ...
... And triple my salary as base salary ...
... Imagine the opportunity that is created.
- You look very powerful there.
- Okay.
There is an attraction for the job ...
... After leaving the Capitol.
And they see people doing it.
I had seen friends ...
... As Tony Rudy,
Mike Scanlon ...
... Go to work for
Jack Abramoff ...
... And see how this operation was assembled, s?
And Jack was on his way to be really great to be on top.
Neil changing the original Neil wanted to be press secretary ...
... The man who wanted to be part of the family Abramoff.
It was unusual to lose a partner?
I've had employees coming and going ...
... Like a revolving door.
I am the classic example of the revolving door.
The revolving door between government and K Street ..
... Is an essential part of the game in Washington.
There is a law that is not allowed to lobby the previous chief.
And I walked carefully to the prohibition of a year ...
... And then directly to the viol.
Jack Neil put to work lobbying his old boss ...
... In the "Open Operacin."
Function.
Ney agreed to help reopen the Tigua casino.
Jack told the tribe to send $ 32,000
Ney policy of the fund and sent him a note to Scanlon.
"I just met with Ney.
We p-mind well. Tigua Arrange. "
What representation made of the influence special ...
... One who had to Rep. Ney?
Indgenas Affairs Commission
His background working with l.
... And that he relied heavily on indgenas ...
... The entire nation, not only to the Tigua. l identify Bob Ney as chairman of the commission.
And the bill identified was that of electoral reform.
The president recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.
The plan was to add a special provisin ...
... To open the casino of the Tigua ...
... In the draft electoral reform law of Bob Ney.
I am pleased to present ...
... The act of "Help Voting
USA. UU." 2002.
Jack Abramoff came personally am on that amendment.
Any lobbyist knows that a deputy dir:
"I will make as it does not destroy the bill."
Get additional clusulas?
They get all the time.
Information is added to the bills ...
... They have no influence on l?
All the time.
T his was one of those cases? S.
We know the process ...
... And information is power.
And then there's a bunch of people ...
... That may add an extra measure in a bill ...
... Without many people noticing.
And sa was the importance of President
Ney in this process.
Then he was the perfect target for us ...
... To add something at the end of the process ...
... Between cocks and midnight to help our customer.
In fact, it is incredible how little it takes ...
... To be that this influence really begins to move.
You do not talk a lot of money here.
Est people really willing
Journalist ...
... To risk their careers for $ 25,000
Or $ 50,000 o.
.. or a golf trip.
Jack organized a trip to Scotland.
On the trip we were
Jack Abramoff ...
... His son, Congressman Ney ...
... Myself and Ralph Reed ...
... Former executive director of the Christian Coalition.
It was flying in the plane of the company.
If this plane, Ralph
Reed told me:
"Jack and I have this deal, blah, blah, blah ...
... And ask you to make an amendment "...
... And add: "Bob, you know this
... it will be illegal ...
... And you can lose your career, "
I s culture will be my answer.
No I have to remember.
What haramos said ...
... I will meet with parliament
Scotsman ...
... And also raise funds for a charity for children ...
... You know, playing golf.
Neil Volz said: "Getting to know more about Jack Abramoff."
Was to drink Scotch whiskey, laughter and fun.
I arrived at 100 for the first time on the golf course at St.
Andrews.
That was a big deal for me personally.
It was great fun, but it was not working.
I remember back ...
... And just ... importuned me inside ...
... I wondered: "What was that?
Es .. not even close to being inappropriate ...
O s? I hope it is. "
It was more or less as ...
Tell me that Jack is really the master ...
Somehow ... that finds a way to return the black and white.
Soon afterwards the golf trip ...
Congressman Ney ...
Thankfully, a visit ...
... Of the Tiguan in Washington.
We met with Bob Ney and tena a terrible sunburn ...
... Well played golf bean while in Scotland.
We met in his office for hours.
Abramoff asked us not to travel mencionramos the golf ...
... Because it is illegal to talk about taxes, I guess ...
... Or make money in these offices.
We talked about everything from border issues ...
... To our problems and Bob
Ney gave us the nod.
Bob Ney clusula incorporates additional information on the casino to the electoral law ...
... But a key senator he refused to play along ...
... And for the Tigua provisin died.
Jack was clearly stunned by the fact ...
... That Bean does not come to the bill.
Organized a conference call.
Ney, the chairman of Commission, spoke to the Tigua ...
... And called me and asked,
"What you say Jack?"
And basically was: "DGAL it was not Jack's fault."
In El Paso ...
... The Speaking Rock casino still be sealed for all ...
... Except for 10-cent slots.
I personally take the blame when things happen.
I feel responsible.
I was one of the guys ...
... Who pressed hard for this effort in Washington.
I was the one who communicated more with Jack Abramoff ...
... And had the information to the board.
How was I did not see this coming?
There is an expression: "A rattlesnake will warn before they attack" ...
Abramoff ... and do not tell us anything.
THE CASTLE OF LETTERS Crumbles
In the "Washington Post" ...
... Reporter Sue Schmidt approached Abramoff.
A week before he left the Article ...
... I went to Greenberg Traurig to talk to themselves.
... Relationship with
Mike Scanlon ...
I really wanted to define ...
... His relationship with Mike Scanlon.
I knew that all come up with something.
Basically we recommend these tribes to hire Scanlon?
I'm not talking about Scanlon and their firms.
Have you join one of the other companies of Mike Scanlon?
Really ... really do not think ... no. I have none.
I think that was an association, as it HACA questions ...
... On Scanlon and he was evasive ...
... And deca, you know ...
... Tena his signature a formal relationship with the firm of Scanlon.
They never talk about their "providers" ...
We call a provider.
S not how much Scanlon received or any other provider of services.
It is not our business.
There is an internal memo that says all spent $ 32 million ...
... Lobbying in the last two years.
The money we received from the tribes ...
... Was found in our advocacy program.
And is available openly.
Not about the $ 32 million.
And I replied, and I do not want to go more all that ...
So do not talk about that ...
... But I told him that
I would write.
It was a Monday morning ...
Article I left ... and the headlines.
On the front page above the fold on the left side.
JACKPOT WITH TRIBAL
CASINOS INDGENAS
That gives me the lift baj ...
Notif ... the office ...
... Mir around me and it was different.
It was like entering a wax museum.
And we sat down and just knew ...
... The house of cards crumbled.
How a lobbyist manipulating the odds in your favor
Jack calls a team meeting with all after the article by the "Post."
I was personally very scared ...
... And did the only question for the board.
I said: "Jack, people would make a lot of questions.
What more do you know? "
And he looked at me and said,
"It s what we have."
Halla research $ 10 million in payments to lobbyist
After this first article, people began to appear.
I began to hear from people who conocaa Abramoff ...
... That Bean was part of their intimate circle.
Everyone has their own reasons ...
... To expose this.
Deciphering a lobbyist PART
OF A FLEET OF CASINOS IN
Abramoff and Scanlon have pleaded guilty to crimes ...
... And began to cooperate with federal prosecutors.
Mr. Scanlon pleads "guilty" ...
... Forcing it to cooperate.
Sources in the authorities say prosecutors focused ...
... Abramoff's relationships with Rep. John Doolittle ...
... And Senator Conrad Burns.
They all deny wrongdoing.
And Abramoff's dealings were not only with Republicans.
The Senate Democrat leader
Harry Reid ...
... And Senator Byron Dorgan ...
... Were among two dozen lawmakers ...
... Who received substantial campaign funds from Abramoff clients.
Both deny any connection ...
... And Dorgan said that money back.
When the Commission began this odyssey ATRS some time ...
... I doubt any of us to imagine ...
... The complicated network to be discovered.
Among those which are being investigated ...
... S the former president of the
Chamber, Tom DeLay of Texas.
DeLay has not been charged as part of the investigation of Abramoff ...
... But in Texas was charged with attempted rape ...
... The campaign finance laws.
It is only another day at work.
DeLay resigned to
Congress in 2006.
Until now, that is in more trouble ...
... Rep. Bob Ney is.
Court documents say that I received ...
... A series of favors and cash ...
... In exchange for helping
Abramoff's clients.
In 2005 ...
... I received many calls from deputy to encontrramos us.
We went to dinner, take something ...
... And suddenly Bob makes me aside ...
... And begins to tell me about the research ...
... And SPECIFIC trip to Scotland.
He says: "T were the one who told me ...
... This was approved by the committee of ethics, right?
And he raised his arms and said:
"On the advice of my attorney, I can not talk to you." I said "What?
We spent three hours ...
Qu? Adnde going with this? "
"Well ... and began to cry and left.
Y s, we Dej a tough message on your answering machine.
Think this is funny ...
... All the shit you did ...
... All the lies told by Jack?
Comic think this is?
I do not think so.
Quiz call your lawyers ...
... And tell them the truth ...
... About all the lies you've said.
What's wrong?
End of message.
You know, I was very upset.
I ...
Heaven ...
... Was a very distressing.
Here was the man who gave me an opportunity bean. l bean been at the center of my universe ...
... For a long period of my life. l tena a good side ...
... And audience was a hard working staff ...
... To become a caricature bean. season tickets ...
... If I did things that were wrong?
S.
But I think that after Jack
Abramoff would prisin ...
... And I went to prisin, people believed that all bean finish ...
... That there were no other member involved in the traffic of influences ...
... That there were no other members involved with Jack Abramoff.
What pile of garbage.
The tribes concerned and the general indgenas ...
... I say they are confident ...
... Est research that is far from over.
I do not think McCain would have done ...
... If I had no idea adnde had just ...
... But knowing there will never be dragged so many other Republicans ...
... At a time trying to get ...
... The Republican nomination for president, eventually.
I think it is completely uncontrolled.
Not entirely full.
Friends McCain lobbyists who helped the Commission ...
... Mysteriously ended indgenas customer ocupndose Jack.
McCain and us the audience to stand as a maverick ...
... Not afraid to tell the truth to the powerful in Washington.
Pregntenle Jack Abramoff if I'm someone powerful in Washington.
They will have to probably go during visiting hours in prison.
And what of Jack Abramoff?
Est sitting in prisin, where only the government's fiscal ...
... Seem to be interested in what they have to say.
His life of bean action film in a documentary made sad ...
... In which, despite their testimony ...
... All the big fish seem to be slipping away.
Perhaps that's why Jack decided to disguise ...
... As a classic
Hollywood villain.
Many people try to make Jack look like a gngster ...
... It came and corrupted the system ...
... Because us black hat in his court.
And again the man in the black hat.
It is almost a caricature.
If our adventure is public, I'm fried.
What Jack had been doing ...
... Bean was what was done before.
People should pay more attention to the fact ...
... We have huge special interests in this country ...
... Who have incredible influence in politics.
Since the Abramoff scandal broke ...
... Have enacted several reforms ...
... But the annual amount paid to lobbyists ...
... Has increased by
$ 1,000 million ...
... And campaign contributions continue to rise.
In the last 10 years, no one has given more to the congress ...
... The financial sector.
By the campaign cash to Washington ...
... Lawmakers accepted the agenda desregulacin of Wall Street.
Each senator pays attention ...
... Industries with great influence in their states, as they should.
What happens when the state comes to market forces ...
... When the Congress comes to market forces?
What happens? These people do things like ... make it impossible ...
... The regulatory requirements in derivative because that is what Wall Street wants.
Wall Street gets away with it in politics.
Wall Street lobbyists were much more effective than Jack Abramoff.
By giving money to Democrats and Republicans alike ...
... Was paid to the Congress to deregulate the banks ...
... Accounting rules, the limits of prstamo ...
... And the housing market.
It was what the college Republicans soad Haban ... a capitalist revolution.
Finally they got what they wanted.
Got your deregulated financial markets ...
... And all the topics about collapsed.
A UDS. THE WE SOLD SAVED
CLOSING SALE SALE

The financial catastrophe ...
Judgement is for faith in the free market ...
... For all these ideas that our heroes have promoted all these years.
Abramoff and the crisis was only ...
Heck, that was only the beginning.
We lost sight in Washington ...
Is qu ... to Congress ...
... A fifth serves Congress.
He served the people of EE. UU.
But instead, we found that
Congress serves ...
... The Chinese owners of maquiladoras, agngsteres Russians.
Congress now serves those interests.
The point is that it has become so accepted ...
... And now is as much a part of our culture, politics ...
... Which is normal.
The average citizen has no voice ...
... That she hoped to have ...
... Because these voices are much more powerful ...
Estn ... and much better funded.
... GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY
THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE ...
This is a story of human failure.
I mean ...
I do not think the corruption is a partisan issue.
The corruption that I was involved was a human failure.
It is a question of power.
I came back I just a machine ... a cog in the machine.
Was: "Hey, levntate ...
... Do your thing, get what you deserve. "
Just lose the notion of what brought me here.
Abramoff may not have succeeded ...
... If the system itself was not corrupt ...
... Where the need for money ... the need for money for members of Congress ...
... Is so fierce and so big ...
... Not have their guard up.
All this has become very troubled by money.
And what do they expect?
S culture is not the solution.
I'll be delighted to have financing public.
"Here 's your money, here is yours.
No need to raise anything.
This will remove all ...
... If tuviramos a different system, but now is not as.
No room for bribes and greed ...
... Or lies or compromise of human freedom.
The main principles are not lost once they leave the light.
They are here it.
I think the lesson we should all learn from this is ...
... That the price of a free society, I think ...
... Is to be vigilant about our democracy.
They could only be influenced by Jack Abramoff ...
... And used the money he offers because we allow.
A while ago you mentioned ...
... If Jack is a rotten apple or not or whether all the barrel.
And the obvious answer for me is that the whole barrel.
Abramoff is fascinating to me because he is ...
... Idealism mixed with the corruption of a man ... ironay layers of the spectacle of it all ...
... And all that paranoid vision of the world ...
... Where everyone is a pen of another person, a great power.
And, of course, he is a pen of the great powers ... money.
You know, he's not the devil ...
... What is behind them.
The great American pastime has never been the baseball ...
... Has always been to make money.
And Jack Abramoff is a wonderful exponent ... a defender of the great American pastime in its own way unique.
It's part of American culture, and we all hope ...
... That we who become rich the next few months.
And I think it gives, interestingly ...
... A great advantage to the moneyed interests in our society ...
... Because every time a politician says
"One moment, the rich getting away with it estn; we will control "...
... A lot of common people say, "No, no, no do ...
Next year ... because being rich ...
... And I want that everything is there when I arrive. "
In January 2010, the Supreme Court ... eliminates all the restrictions
... The campaign spending announcements made by companies.
Jack Abramoff was sentenced to 4 years in prisin for fraud ...
... Evasin tax and conspiracy to bribe officials public.
Bob Ney prisin pas 17 months for conspiracy to commit fraud ...
... And giving false testimony. Currently operating a radio program.
Neil Volz pleaded guilty to conspiring ...
To corrupt officials ... public.
His sentence was probation and community service.

"Was this collection half-full
or half-empty?
"That was the obvious question after
Isaac Mizrahi's show Thursday night.
"What he dubbed a mix
was more of a mess.
"His usually great color sense failed him; His fabric sense failed him.
And certainly, his sense of how a modern woman dresses after 8:00 P.M. failed him."
It's just the worst day
in the world after the show.
I just hate the...
I hate waking up.
I hate not sleeping after I've
just worked so hard, you know?
Worrying about the reviews
the next day.
I don't really take criticism
very well, I don't think,
but I've learned to sort of...
it's painful, you know.
I don't have a very...
actually, I have a very low threshold of pain, but... physical pain, anyway.
I'm a baby even when I go for a facial or something. I can't stand it.
But the thing is,
I... I hate, like, mediocre things said about me.
I hate, uh... you know, I hate that...
Because, you know, you either say something's great or say it stank...
Or ignore it, you know?
That's how I feel. Ignore... ignore it if you don't like it.
¶¶
¶ hmm-hmm-hmm ¶
¶ oh, you make me feel ¶
¶ mighty real ¶
¶ San Francisco ¶
¶ I say you make me feel ¶
¶ mighty real ¶
¶ Sylvester, sister you're an angel walking among us ¶
¶ on the face of this earth ¶
¶ you were so beautiful
you were so fragile ¶
¶ you were so real ¶¶
here's my process:
I get inspired, somehow, somewhere... from the ballet, from a dance, from a movie, something.
I get this gesture in my head.
Then I think, like, is this worthy of doing a whole collection?
Usually it is, because it's the only thing I can think of.
And from there, I just do all these millions of sketches...
About that one gesture. That's a chesterfield with the astrakhan trim.
And I work with annica.
They make patterns.
This would be coyote and that would be beast, let's say, trim.
We make them out of muslin first.
Muslin is this inexpensive thing that you make just to see the shape...
- And balance of everything.
- Don't you want a bigger sleeve?
Definitely. I want more here.
- Then we do fabric fittings.
- That would be much better, wouldn't it?
We book the girls, we plan the show, we plan the figures.
What gets annoying is actually when it becomes like a giant puzzle.
Things have to be taken out for certain reasons.
Things have to be added in this very kind of clever way.
That's when it becomes grating on my nerves, because it's no longer about creating a look; It's about creating a show.
This is for a 750 girl. 750 dollars an hour for four hours.
- What's an average girl?
- Five-ten.
Okay. And do you do shows?
Mm-hmm.
Can I watch you walk? Sure.
Hi, Amber. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
How pretty you are.
Thank you. What a pleasure.
Can you take your clothes off?
Just the jacket.
Take all your clothes off.
Where are you from?
Oklahoma. Oklahoma?
You're such a liar.
I swear to God.
Can you stand up a second?
And take your things off?
Thank you.
Let's see. You've done a million shows?
 A million.
A million? Yeah, like her.
Thick shoulders, which is good.
Isaac Mizrahi.
Take these off.
Can you see without them?
Of course.
And is this how you're gonna keep your hair? No.
You're gonna shave it more?
Yeah.
Normally, it's like you. Bald.
Like my face. Okay.
Great. Thank you.
Thank you to you.
I'll see you maybe.
Have a nice day.
You too. Bye.
Yes, I did.
I'm sitting here and I'm watching nanook of the north.
Oh, it's so amazing, isn't it?
And it's so inspiring...
I can't even believe...
How beautiful these eskimos are.
And I love they all have fur pants, and the thing is, all I want to do is fur pants.
But I know if I do them, I'll get stoned off of seventh Avenue...
Like some wanton heretic
or something.
So there won't be any fur pants
coming down my runway.
It's about women not wanting to look like cows, I guess, you know.
And, in fact, there's something very charming about cows.
Anyway, you know what I mean.
There's something very charming about a big, fat fur pant.
Actually, there was one thing I wanted to do, which was a fur jumpsuit.
Like the banana splits. You know, those big, kind of giant...
I mean, I would love to have one of those in beast... let's say in beast fur, to walk the dog in or something.
You don't to think about anything; You just have your bra and panties on.
You just put this giant fur jumpsuit on, head to toe, hood and little hush puppy boots or something.
You're out walking the dog and looking amazing, surprising everyone in your neighborhood,
which, in this case, would probably be Upper East Side or Alaska.
You know, that which is our standard hood, right?
What I'm trying to do is... Douglas has this fantastic down coat.
It's a drop shoulder, and yet it wants to be smaller at the waist...
And just be this little shape like that.
What I want to discuss this morning are those embroideries of eskimos.
These are simple. They're just gonna put into work, and boom, they're done.
You know what I mean? It's like a little tulle skirt with a long pony skin skirt.
That looks like an eskimo. I just don't want it to resemble at all those Indian things.
And it shouldn't,
because it doesn't.
I am loving that; Look at that adorable shape.
 Isn't that cute?
Oh, isn't that adorable?
Adorable. Adorable!
How 'bout the clothes you made for
Norman and Marilyn's wedding?
Oh, my God. Those were so embarrassing.
Embarrassing?
They were so awful. The whole town was talking about the wedding clothes.
They were so bad.
They were so beautiful.
Embarrassing. It was... I don't know, it was like a straitjacket.
It was completely straight.
I didn't care. I wore it.
I wore it on the holy holidays, the biggest holiday.
I came in and I was so proud.
I said, "my Isaac made this."
Every single morning on my way to school when I was really young,
I used to steal into your room while you were both asleep.
You took money? I used to take money every day.
You took money? I can't believe you never figured it out.
I thought for sure you knew that I was doing it. Isaac!
I would take money and go to midwood trimmings and buy all these fabrics.
Hmm. It's so true.
Mm-hmm.
It's really true. So I didn't tell you about eartha kitt, did I?
Oh, honey, we went up to visit her.
It was amazing.
Yes, in scheherazade, right?
You go to le chien on Saturday to get yourself all dressed up.
It's almost impossible to have any style at all without the right dogs.
You should have seen how chic it was to have these two poodles flooding out of the room.
I just don't know what to say, honestly.
Is that why you're gonna make gowns for me?
Yes, I am, I'm gonna make gowns for you!
That is how she referred to it.
She said, "will you make me gowns?
Ah-ha-ha-ha."
I was like, "are you kidding? I will make you nothing but gowns."
This is like... I can't wait.
She was like, "something where
I can really move around."
Do all sorts of crazy, wonderful things, you know, so that it doesn't restrict me.
It's got to be a dress that I can do everything in, you know.
R-r-r-r-r-r! You know.
- R-r-r-r-r-r!
¶ R-r-rum tee Dee dum Dee dum tee dum tee dum tee Dee dum tee ¶¶ you have to see this book that she gave me.
It's called eartha kitt:
Confessions of a sex kitten.
I loved working with Orson welles, this huge man.
And I had a song to sing.
She does this song, and he's supposed to kiss her, and instead, he bit her...
And she started bleeding on stage.
Oh, my God!
So she starts bleeding on stage, and she was furious.
After the show she went to his dressing room... "'Orson, why did you bite me?' he pushed me aside like a little mouse." That's how she said it.
"He pushed me aside like a little mouse.
And he said, 'I got excited.'" that was it? "'I got excited'."
¶ Santa, cutie, there's
one thing I really do need ¶
¶ the deed to a platinum mine ¶

I had this preview with candy pratts, and it went really well.
She adored what I showed her, which is, you know, a good indication,
'cause candy would tell me;
She would say she hated it.
She wouldn't say she hated it, but she would indicate to me that it wasn't working.
Just between you and I,
I'm sort of feeling for, like, color in this way.
I'm not fond of plaids like that.
Forget the... Forget the plaids.
What about those colors?
I like stronger color than that.
Stronger color? Stronger color.
- Really? Now I'm totally confused.
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Just one amazing color, like if you have a long matte Jersey dress like that.
It looks heaven.
What I think happens... and this is totally off camera.
Sound on this one should be turned off because that's not right.
- Turn it off.
- Avocado?
That's chicken with Pesto.
 Ooh.
And this is? Here's what the ouija board said last night.
He wasn't looking at the board, and I was calling out letters.
Ouija board was saying, "sexy, sexy," and I'm like, "thank God."
It's like, "dominatrix. Dominatrix.
Mixed with Hitchcock."
I'm like, "that's insane."
"Hitchcock meets marnie."
It actually spelled out the word "marnie."
"M-a-r-n-I-e." Like this. No!
I was like, "marnie."
It was like, "yes."
"M-I-c-k j-a-g-g..." oh, it's a big speller.
"Ouija"... you know how it goes over itself?
"Ouija likes... l-I-k-e-s...
B-o-y-s."
"Ouija likes boys."
I'm like, "ouija likes boys?"
"A-t n-I-g-h-t."
"Ouija likes boys at night."
Wow, what does that mean?
I said, "you mean Mick Jagger?"
It said, "yes."
Just a tuxedo or something.
It said, "flats for night. High heels, dominatrix shoes for day.
Flats for night." Insane.
How do you feel about this?
Scary. Very scary.
The collection is being designed with the ouija board.
Totally. What can I tell you?
It works.
I saved all this money...
And came to Paris
all by myself when I was 17.
It was, of course... the first time you experience jet lag...
Is a very crucial and important, you know, memory.
Anyway, there I was, jet lagged out of my mind, seventeen and landing in Paris with this big purple leather ensemble...
That I had constructed especially for the flight.
Terrified. It was the first time
I'd ever been away from home...
Without my parents or something.
You know, I wasn't sleeping.
I was waking up at 6:00 in the morning.
What was great was that all the pastry shops open really early, like at 4:00 in the morning, and I'd be walking on the streets buying pastries.
Actually, that's my favorite thing... another favorite thing about France.
I probably... the thing is, I say I hate traveling and being away from home, but I would love to live here for awhile or to have an apartment.
It would be so cool,
'cause it's the coolest place.
I mean, look at this.
Look at this.
It's terrible to work so hard
in a foreign place.
You have to keep doing these appointments and all you want to do...
Is blow your nose or get sinutab.
And there's no sinutab, you know?
Or feel comfortable and have people around you doing what they're supposed to be doing.
But you're all alone;
It's horrible.
I can never wait to leave, that's the thing.
I want to just get here, have a great cup of coffee...
And then get the hell out.
¶¶

¶¶
You read the cards? You'll tell us our fortune, our love lives?
Individually?
Individually, yes.
When you get to me, I'll tell you what I want to know.
They're good. They're good because they're seasoned.
I love them because they're well-worn.
There is a wallpaper in that bathroom that is so good.
Did you see the wallpaper?
That? Yeah.
So good. Wallpaper?
Darling, I would kill for a swatch of that wallpaper.
I'm sure Donna karan had, like, a polaroid camera when she went in there.
I went to the louvre today
to the costume archives.
They have this unbelievable fake fur from the 18th century.
It's amazing. Fake furs in the 18th century?
Made of silk. They're divine.
What's he saying?
I think he says this
to everyone.
But your whole energy is more... it's always inside of you.
- Reconnaissance.
- Reconnaissance?
Reconnaissance?
- Reconnaissance.
- To remember, no?
No. No, no.
To be recognized.
Yeah, to be known.
To have a comeback.
The comeback!
Always the comeback.
Always the comeback!
The comeback is major.

If you're "ger-na."
If you're "ger-na."
That's our imitation of this kind of wonderful illustration teacher...
That we all had at Parsons.
She used to say, "now, if you're ger-na draw with chalk, you're ger-na have to draw... you're ger-na."
"Yarn't" comes from Bette Davis, from that movie called who's afraid of...
 no. What ever happened to baby Jane?
You know that scene where Joan
Crawford is in the wheelchair...
And she says, "if I can only get out of this chair"... and she says, "yarn't ever gonna leave that chair, blanche, and yarn't ever gonna..." yarn't. Yarn't.
So we put it together.
Yarn't ever ger-na... you can make sentences. It's pretty insane.
People think it's insane.
You don't know what you're saying.
Blanche, yarn't ever gonna sell this house.
And yarn't ever gonna leave it...
Either.
Maybe just do these in suede and those in nubuck.
Suede, we're getting in black.
We're "ger-na" get in black.
Then this thing is probably wrong to have in here.
That's one, two, three, four.
- Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
- These are out, right?
Color, which is here, right?
- I was thinking, make this...
- That check... - a bustle.
These are the beast coats and almost the same jacket, minus that figure, right?
These are simple. They're gonna put them to work, and boom, they're done.
Look at it on.
If I had a short skirt, right?
Is it better shorter?
It's better shorter, isn't it?
Isn't it good? Women's wear isn't going to be happy; There's no color.
Then I redid... I know, exactly.
Who's doing the crossword puzzle?
I redid the, um... um...
"incur."
"Incur."
Um, five. "Iguana."
Iguana. Iguana.
Don't put it on your wall
until after April 12th.
2:45? You would have
till, like, 3:00.
So Elle magazine, five people
at 2:45.
Speaking of
astrakhan, there's this dress.
Oh, my God! That's great!
You love that?
Look how cute this little skirt is.
I can't wait for you to see that.
Pink satin, with, like, a tutu?
Where are they going to be?
- I've got something for the 7th.
- When are you shooting?
12th and 13th. Of, um, April?
You're not shooting on the 12th, honey, because my show is on the 12th.
You better be there.
There's always this moment of revelation when you kind of know...
That you're going to dare yourself to do something.
This time it happened.
I don't remember exactly when.
It was way before Christmas when I thought, oh, it has to be this kind of like, you know,
'50s cheesecake meets...
Like eskimo, kind of just crazy fake fur.
Very glamorous kind of a thing.
I was watching
call of the wild last year.
There's this scene in that movie where she is abandoned by her husband...
'Cause she's on the tundra, and he goes looking for food and eventually dies.
And Clark gable discovers her after, like, four days of being frostbitten and nearly dead.
Of course, when the close-up happens, the makeup is perfect, dewy skin, perfect eyebrows, lip liner;
The hair is, you know, perfection.
I'm thinking, if you must freeze on the tundra, this is the way to do it.
So I made a big note in my notebook,
"call of the wild."
Is he dead?
No, he isn't dead, and he isn't a he.
Maybe that could be...
maybe like right here...
Could be a little shorter.
Why do I like... because I'm
American, and I'm not a stone.
That's why I like
Mary Tyler Moore.
Um, basically, I think because between her and Jackie Kennedy, they shaped this country, that's why.
Between all of her portrayals... between
Laura petrie and Mary Richards, it's, you know, what shaped
Americans' whole taste level.
¶ Who can take a nothing day ¶

I am very happy where I am.
I am very happy in New York.
I don't need a lot of money. I don't need to move a thousand times.
I don't need to go to Australia or to India to do collections about those places.
I can do them
from my imagination,
or from having seen, you know,
the flintstones episode...
That was set in Australia
or something, you know.
That... that's what I love.
You know, that's what
I'm kind of about.
A lot of times she bought clothes that were cheater clothes, like cheap clothes, and turned them around.
Like high necklines in the front and low necklines in the back.
That's cause I wore it back to the front.
Like strange things.
Cut them at strange lengths, sew feathers on them.
Daisies... she had this pair of great shoes that were mules...
That all of the sudden had daisies on them, miraculously.
And who knew he was looking at them?
I mean, he was four years old. I was obsessed with them, okay?
He was four years old and he noticed the daisies on the mules?
You all right? Actually, we have a very big day tomorrow.
Naomi... like, all these girls.
Cindy Crawford, 9:45. Perfect.
And it's all day, right?
What are you doing for fall? I know you've always been a proponent of color.
Are you doing color now?
I'm doing a lot of color.
I'm sort of doing, like, uh, Giselle meets Fred flintstone or something.
It's all about fake furs, actually, for me.
These textures that are sort of beastly.
The texture of Isaac's fake furs...
Are so extraordinary.
Plus, weightless.
Pom-pom. Nothing. Powder puff.
You know what? Pins get stuck in here.
You better check for pins.
They get lost?
Yeah, they get lost. The thing is, all of the sudden you discover one.
And then Clark gable, like, discovers her nearly frostbite... Clark gable.
Clark gable... nearly frostbite, in a, like, skunk coat or something.
You know, fur to, like, here.
Then they have a close-up of her being discovered on the tundra.
Dewy makeup, eyebrows... she's supposed to be, like, you know... perfect lip liner. Everything is so perfect. Key light.
And she's, of course, dying of frostbite.
Which I love.
That's my favorite reference.
But...
Perfect makeup on the tundra.
Perfect hair.
Polly was freaking me out last night.
She was saying, "well, you know..." the whole scale of Isaac's show...
Changed my eye.
I had been saying,
"I don't know about short.
Not too short.
Too short looks wrong."
"But when you do too short,
it works."
And I'm thinking, "what does that mean?
Are all my skirts too short?"
What do they want, a longer short skirt?
Sorry, we did that last year.
Honey, what is this funky
tissue in your pocket?
I don't know, to tell the truth.
It's some scary... it's not scary. I don't have anything scary in my pockets.
Trust me.

Irving. Irving. Irving.
My name is Irving. I write for
Marty Allen with the crazy hair.
You're with Marty Allen?
Marty Allen!
- He uses all my jokes.
- Like which ones?
Uh, you know, uh, uh...
New York has the most topless bars in the country.
- Yeah.
- Really?
- I feel like I'm living in New York titty.
- Ohh! Irving, please!
This racy humor!
Who's the greatest mayor this city ever had?
A fella by the name of naze was the greatest mayor. Why?
You never heard of naze? Never.
You never heard of mayor naze?
Never heard of him... oh, mayonnaise! Oh, you are... what's your name?
Sandra bernhard.
How do ya like that?
You're a famous person.
Of course she is. You're in with, uh... let's see, who's with you?
I read about you and, uh, uh... oh, gee. Oh, here it comes.
The one who ran for mayor.
Bella abzug.
Bella abzug? Heavenly. What did they write about us?
- I wrote her campaign song when she ran for mayor.
- Sing it.

Oh, I love New York. You know who raved about your show? Andre talley.
- I talked to him last night and he said,
- Oh, look at this!
"It's genius!
It's absolutely genius!"
- When did you break it?
- I was trying to move it by myself.
I knew it! Steven, you're crazy.
You fool!
You'd better be careful.
It's a little dusty.
Oh, who cares? Ohh! Ohh, ohh.
Remember when merv Griffin used to have his afternoon show? That was Mike Douglas.
¶ No, no, no, no, no, no, no ¶ ¶ yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes ¶ it was also... maybe it was on another coast.
No, here, in Michigan. Merv
Griffin was always at 8:00.
Are you finally waking up?
Yeah, finally. God.
I'm finally waking up, yes.
You sounded very, very...
I took a valium last night. I could not go to sleep.
You seem a little bit, uh...
Well, I am. Agitated.
You know what it is? It's because my fittings start in a week from now.
I'm trying to focus everybody so we have as many things ready for the fittings as possible.
Half the stuff isn't ready.
I mean, the shoes are running really late, which is crazy.
The clothes... I'm just freaking out in general.
I can't take this. I definitely want the cashmere, but if it's not gonna be possible...
otherwise I can't stand it one more second, you know.
 No, I can't... I mean... it's, like, fucking gray flannel.
I'm not asking for, you know... it's gray flannel and corduroy.
Like I'm asking for, like, some kind of extinct animal skins, you know.
Where the hell is she? I can't deal with this anymore.
Just get her over here.
They sent this rib with it, and you put your finger right through it.
They were trying to put the lycra in it to make it more steady, but they tried three different trials and it didn't work.
Well, I don't understand it. It's yarn.
Can't they just knit a rib?
That knit on there is washed.
Then wash the sweaters.
They always say the same thing. These agencies are such fucking liars; I can't deal with them.
I can't deal with this either,
I have to tell you right now.
- I can't do all of this; I just can't.
- I know, I know.
Every single one of these appointments are ridiculous.
I don't know what they think I am made of, you know.
Where are those chips?
Everything is frustrating. Every single thing is frustrating.
Except designing clothes.
That's not frustrating.
That's really liberating and beautiful.
You know, being... frustrating is, I don't know, being overweight and not being able to lose weight... that's a problem.
Anything that you're really working hard at that's not working, that's a problem.
But frankly, designing clothes is never a problem.
I've always sort of been inspired by that character called...
Boris lermontov from the red shoes.
I've always wanted to be that character.
That incredibly precise,
handsome, trim, in control... he's totally in control.
He's very, sort of, severe.
He finishes with people and says, "good morning."
He doesn't say "thank you;" He says
"good morning," and they walk off.
- It's really dramatic.
- If you take my advice, it is worth remembering that it is much more disheartening...
To have to steal than to be stolen from.
Hmm?
Good morning.
There's this scene where he's having breakfast in the most beautiful room...
it's this gorgeous beige room.
I actually thought about that room a lot when I was decorating my apartment.
It's all kind of this dark kind of honey color and black accents.
The piano is black lacquer and he has a coromandel screen...
¶¶
That girl has a run-of-the-play contract.
- I know all about run-of-the-play contracts!
- Helen, this isn't gonna help... the only hit that comes out of a
Helen Lawson show is Helen Lawson, and that's me, baby, remember?
There's one star in a Helen Lawson production and that's Helen Lawson. Remember?
Me! One star... in a Helen
Lawson production...
And that's Helen Lawson.
And that's me, remember?
There's one star!
There's one star in a
Helen Lawson production, and that's Helen Lawson, and that's me! Remember?
The sculptures that Richard Sara makes that are, like, scary...
Can't look at that there.
Messes with my eyes.
I like it. That one's really cool, I think.
I love these pictures. This messes with my eyes, though.
Very chic pictures. To my eyes, it's like...
from a certain distance, when you look at it, it's controlling the picture.
You see?
- When are we getting engaged?
- Engaged? I am engaged.
Every time she has another ring at the fittings,
I say, "who are you engaged to this time?"
I've only been engaged once in my life.
Oh, right!
It's mark Morris. I see him.
Right there. Where?
Mark! Where is he?
He's over there.
Naomi Campbell, mark Morris.
Nice to meet you.
You are my heroine. Yes, of course you are.
How could you not be?
- She was a ballet dancer for a really long time.
- Me too.
Look, it's a dance step.
Do it again.
Here, I'll hum the music.
¶ Dee Dee Dee ¶
¶ ba da da Dee da da da da da da da da bom ¶
Yeah, exactly. It fits me, though, exactly.
Isn't it great? It's sort of rod Stewart on me.
It's very munster
It's very rod Stewart.
It's very good. It is good, but what if you had little tiny breasts?
No, it would be better, because your back is smaller if you're a girl.
- That's true.
- And your shoulders are smaller.
It's not balanced on you.
It's kind of simian, isn't it?
It's supposed to be.
Well, then, it worked. It's beastly, really, more than simian.
Every time she comes in
it's another engagement ring.
Let's see the engagement ring
this time, Naomi.
Then she'll wear it open like this.
So that's the jacket, right, annica?
Taking it out, opening the vents again, and then this, right?
Here, hold that, would you?
Oh, Naomi!
I won't have it. I'll take it out.
You promise?
Off. Good.
Make sure this doesn't show, okay?
You should take off all model's own jewelry. Oops.
Except for model's
own navel ring.
No, that's coming out. The ring doesn't come out.
The chain and the blue thing.
Mary! I can't! It closes up in an hour.
I have to get it redone. Twenty minutes you'll be on the runway.
As soon as air gets to it, it starts to... ew! Gross! I have to leave it in for nine months before it stays.
You don't understand.
When I take my engagement ring off, the newspapers say I'm not getting married.
So I get scandal.
- The boot is silly, isn't it?
- The high boot?
Hello. Hello. I don't like the boot.
The hush puppy boot?
It's not working. I'm in the middle of a fitting and can't talk.
Where are you? The high heel.
It's a poodle moment.
It's a poodle thing. It's a pink, sort of Parisian poodle thing.
Bye! Thank you! Bye, Ingrid!
Bye, everyone!
Did you? I had braids and I had the little curls here.
They even had a lot of bald men because it was punk and hasidic.
There was booing at the end.
I didn't hear anybody booing.
I certainly heard afterwards, "oh, my God!
Gautier's gone too far.
"Now he's done a thing about hasidic Jews.
"Jews are going to be upset and people are going to say, you know, this is a sacred thing."
I completely, completely disagree.
I think that what was so fantastic about it, and what is so fantastic about gautier, is that he incorporates politics and culture into his fashion.
I think to take something that none of us understand, necessarily, and mix it up and incorporate it into the culture...
And show all sorts of different people wearing it, is a way of removing strife.
I think that was really great.
I think that what one sees in
Isaac's collections, you know... in a way he sort of does the same thing.
He doesn't do it with that subject, but he picks on subjects that so many of us, that are part of life.
His last collection when he did the divorcée and the Hollywood thing...
I think to build content into fashion is where fashion's at.
Oh, please, no navel rings.
You don't have a navel ring, do you?
Do you have a navel bra... a navel bra!
Do you have a navel ring?
No. Please don't surprise me.
Do you want me to get one?
 No, I don't!
¶ It's working ¶ that's what Naomi would say.
¶ It's working ¶¶ aren't they handsome?
Very handsome.
She's going to work at hachette filipacchi.
She's going to work at Elle.
You know what I think?
This is very Isaac does Ralph Lauren.
Is it?
Thanks, Nina.
Now I won't sleep for the rest of the week.
I was just trying to make
a tiny little bit of fun!
Inuit. No, it's true. She's right. I didn't know that "eskimo" is a slur.
It's like a slur. It means
"fish eater" or something.
According to shalome.
"Eskimo" means "fish eater."
"Fish eater." Yeah.
It's fish hater.
Raw fish eater.
If there was a word for gefilte fish eater, that would be me, actually.
Gefilte fish eater.
This is honestly one of the worst weeks I've ever had in my whole life.
You should call me when you feel like that.
It'll make you feel better.
It was just so busy.
Monday I had a huge fight with Nina and Jennifer.
I actually ended up screaming at them in my office, which I've never done.
I've never done something like that.
It made you feel better.
It felt good, actually.
That's all.
Sometimes you have to clear the air, honey.
You want to me to tell you something?
Please.
I'm getting women's wear every day.
Everything you did I see them doing.
Me too. I swear to God!
I know. I see this guy coming out with Peter Pan collar...
And the ruffles coming out of the sleeves like you did.
Everything you do is copied left and right.
Me too. Left and right, without even a modification.
I don't know what... it's like I have no perspective on anything right now.
You haven't got an idea? No,
I have a million ideas.
Why don't you let me look at them, Isaac?
You're laughing? You're a riot.
Excuse me. I just think it's very funny.
That's not funny at all.
That's very funny. I have a very good eye, Isaac.
¶ I know ¶
¶ beyond a doubt ¶

lead me there soon ¶

¶ bye-bye ¶¶ it's actually perfect on her.
You know, it was actually in
Paris, with katell at the louvre.
And we found all these racks.
It was like this empty space
with all these racks of muslin.
I picked up one of the muslins
and there was...
The most amazing corset.
It's impossible to believe.
It's metal inside.
It's metal, but goatskin also.
In between the linen, which is lining, and the iron.
Otherwise the iron would have pierced through there...
And would have-
gorged their gorgeous...
But it's such fabulous... to me it has to be our favorite Teddy bear.
Actually, it's... if you have enough hair.
It's to be like nanook of the north.
Oh, I see. Mm-hmm.
Sophisticated, soft and warm.
Saturn is rising above your horizon.
Now, on one level, you could have more than the normal aggravation with people...
That you deal with.
You could find people
who are even important to you...
In terms that you need
their cooperation in the work... you could find that they're not as cooperative as you would like them to be.
I'm doing this very new thing...
With, um, the way I'm showing, which is a platform and a scrim.
There are girls changing from behind the scrim...
So you can see through to where they're changing.
That could be a little bit of a problem.
Take all those flats out, right?
And you give me a scrim, just a scrim.
A white scrim.
And we have the name painted on... like in the theater?
You know, a scrim. Have you been to the ballet ever in your entire life?
It's like a painted backdrop, and you see right through it.
But this won't be painted. It'll just be white. Wait a minute.
You can do it also as a color.
So you're suggesting that...
I'm not suggesting it.
The models actually...
Are seen changing? Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Yes.
Are they gonna want to do that?
I don't give a shit.
They're gonna have to do it.
 Here's the thing, yasmeen. Go.
They're gonna give you a bra and a panty because...
In the show, hopefully... well, if you don't want, you don't have to.
You have to cut that ribbon.
In the show, hopefully, there's like a scrim.
You can see through where the girls are changing. If you want.
You know, when you go to the ballet and you see a backdrop that you see through.
Okay, yeah, yeah. That's what it's gonna be, I hope.
They're gonna see us in bras and underwear?
Maybe. If you don't mind.
Some of the girls don't care.
Uh, I kinda care. You care?
All right. That's fine.
So she... she cares. I care.
She'll be in the back somewhere.
Robert, are you keeping a list of girls who don't want to do it?
Yeah. Of girls who care.
Naomi, I have to tell you about this thing in the show.
That is that some of the girls... maybe you, even... are going to be changing on stage where people can see you, sort of.
Uh-huh. But you'll be in your bra and panties the whole time.
What? No.
No.
Now, Cindy, here's the idea of the show.
If you say you don't like the idea, you're uncomfortable...
- be careful.
- You don't wanna put it...
Hello! This says hello to me very distinctly!
Isn't that amazing? It's fake?
It's fake. At last I have a sable coat!
Don't you think? It's so politically correct.
It's politically very correct. Oh, the '40s chubby is back! Thank God!
Why are you going so fast? Because
I want to show you the highlights.
Actually, that is very good. That little chiffon dress with the sweater.
Very good, no?
Not fussy, no? No, never fussy.
Fussy, finished.
Fussy, finished.
Too much jewelry, no.
Bad. Wrong.
Anjelica Houston last night, she had that beautiful dress...
And then these long earrings... no!
I have just been to a show. Be careful of makeup. Be careful.
"You just made fashion history." "You..." did she say that to you? My favorite thing was once she said to us,
"oh, it erases everything!"
I love that line.
This is so major.
Isn't that so good?
This is so major.
You get what I want? It's sort of, you know... it's not...
explain to me how glamorous
your life really is.
Start with, here it is, 8:30.
Um, here it is, 8:30. I still have makeup on from the last show.
I'm an hour behind schedule.
And I have a new husband at home waiting for me...
Kind of patiently.
Some other strange man under your skirt.
Isaac under my skirt.
Is this the height of fashion?
This is the peak.
This is mount Everest, darling.
Isaac's first show,
I was hysterically sobbing.
I had no idea he was so sophisticated.
He was a kid.
The color combinations and the fabrics...
Were so sophisticated for his age.
Very, very, very high.
And it was... I heard somebody say, one of the models... she said, "fashion history is made tonight."
We're still trying to get buttons, order decided on, um, stockings.
Our shoes... are, like, late.
Um, it... it's just a madhouse.
It's completely crazy.
I think... everything is designed...
And I think, like, somewhere he knows it's good, but then he starts to doubt himself.
We know it's good, but if he doesn't... if he starts to doubt himself, then there's just no way to convince him.
You just have to let him go through.
¶¶
I'll look into it. I don't know if these people can handle...
Creating this scrim.
Well... the other thing, Isaac... you know how much a scrim costs? Like 40 dollars.
It's so not expensive.
This scary union thing, we'll overcome it.
I'll stretch the fucking thing.
I'm just afraid of the press at this point.
Don't be so afraid.
I'm not afraid.
The minute you start getting afraid of the press is the minute that they're mean...
I had a conversation with twyla tharp.
It's like the most common material in the world.
That's twyla tharp.
They do this every day.
Why do we have to distract from the clothes?
They look so good.
Nina is snow white.
Actually, she looks
like snow white, doesn't she?
Just exactly like the cartoon of snow white and the seven dwarfs of Disney.
Um, but aside from that, she's just a really important... person...
Because she...
Feels everything as much as I do.
She goes through everything as much as I do.
She's as devoted as I am,
I think.
Nina is like a sister.
I always sort of viewed her
in that sisterly way.
It's a really great relationship that we have.
Meanwhile, just covering up this little nipple means that you're not nude?
How did you have that idea?
I just had it.
I had it a long time ago. To do it with the scrim or to do it with nothing?
I was gonna do it with nothing, then
I was at the ballet and thought,
"if Nina's too nervous without anything, we'll just have a scrim."
You show me the pose, and I'll do it.
All right. Do this.
Last night I went to the
Knicks game and they won.
Have you ever been to the garden for a game and sit in the front row?
No. It's so cool.
I'll go! These guys are like gods because they're so tall.
Hugely tall. Beautiful bodies, like sculpture.
It's so funny that I know this whole different world which is fun.
It's fun to not only know fashion people.
Once I went to a baseball game at shea stadium...
And it was out of this world.
At night... it's all lit for day so it's all this halogen light.
Everything becomes kind of surreal.
The grass is really sort of like lime green.
It's so fabulous.
And the skin is orange.
I was screaming. I was so into it.
I was so excited.
At some point somebody in the back screamed out, "sit down, Nelly!"
It was so embarrassing.
Everybody started to roar.
This is what I meant when I said these are cheesy fake... fake shooting is cheesy.
Absolutely.
I just had this big fight. "I'm not trying to be a bitch, but really, you cannot fake a shoot; It's cheesy." You're absolutely right.
Thank you very much.
It's paper dolls.
We're like on... Models, inc.
 On models, inc.
Beautiful.
You're a little close. It's like, hello, my pores are not that small.
Exactly.
Your pores are very small.
¶ Don't need to waste it ¶¶
ooh, that was flat.
I can't decide if it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever done in my life...
To be away from my studio.
But you know what? It's not about me.
It's about the sewers now.
I've done my work.
¶ Do-do-do do-do-do-do ¶
¶ Do-do do-do-do you're gonna make it after all ¶
¶ da-da dun-dun dun-dun-dun dun ¶¶
You better bring it in to him.
He's gonna seem like an idiot
if he doesn't know.
We're not going to design fake furs because gautier is doing it? That's crazy.
Do you believe this?
"Nanook of the north."
Isaac's gonna flip. How could another designer have the exact same idea?
And they show before we do.
What? Look at this.
Oh, my God!
Do you believe this? No.
Oh, my God!
Doesn't look anything like... oh, my God!
Take it away! Take it away!
Oh, take it away! This happens every season with people.
It doesn't mean that we can't do this.
We're obviously doing it. That's why... don't show these things to me.
I've not been looking at it.
Just don't show it to me.
You showed it to me. It's like you took some evil pleasure in it.
No, I didn't, Isaac!
We're gonna talk
to women's wear tomorrow.
Right now I feel very trapped, in a way, like there's no way to change anything...
Or rethink anything.
It's all done.
A scrim. I scrim, you scrim.
We all scrim for the scrim.
To scrim or not to scrim.
That is the question.
The scrim, yeah. I'm totally ready.
Who really cares, anyways?
I mean... yeah, I'm sure they care, but anyways, who cares?
Yep. Yep, really.
It's very good, isn't it?
With the pin and everything.
This is my mother's hat, actually.
"Lucilla Mendez, exclusively New York."
I love it.
I think it's so good.
How come you're so stressed out
right now?
Um, I'm not really that stressed out.
I hate it when people tell me I'm stressed out, more than anything.
I'm not that stressed out.
I'm fine.
That was an endless fitting
today, am I wrong?
It was just...
I was losing my mind.
Putting the scrim together,
way more overtime than normal.
We always have overtime.
Um, I don't know. I just feel really vulnerable.
I feel really set up or something, as I do before most collections, you know.
And it's a mood swing.
I have a feeling it has more to do with what I ate for lunch...
Than anything else, but... and you can't help it.
You can't help feeling moody.
You know?
You just can't help it.
Um,
I like to feel in control, and, you know, on the last couple of days,
I don't ever feel like
I'm in control.
I feel like, um, out of control, so, um...
I just can't wait for the show, really.
That's it.
I just can't wait for it.
It has to be the most wonderful
20 minutes of a designer's life.
You know?
You look forward to it...
So much.
How fabulous this is gonna be, you know?
You're just gonna see right through.
Amazing, you know?
¶¶
Then you have to change from that into this really quickly, so...
no, you can turn your back
or go in the corner.
There's also gonna be a dresser, so... we don't have the lights on, though.
Guys?
You can see everything!
No, you see everything!
I told you!
Can you see what I'm wearing?
You can see everything!
I know! I told you!
It's my natural exhibitionism...
That comes out of this situation.
You really do see everything. Oh, yes.
So, how are we going from here to there?
You can see everything!
It's like you're the... you're out there.
- It's so crazy to dress nude next to Naomi and Carla.
-  Oh, shut up!
I must be out of my fucking mind to dress next to the two best bodies in the business!
Ouch! Oww!
Oww! Oww!
Aaah! You hurt my hand!
You have taken him!
We just got here!
Let me get roseanne!
My God!
Give me just a little, all right?
All right, just a tad.
Being rude to me isn't going to help.
So, are you on the list?
 Joyce. Yes.
- Okay, so what's your last name?
- Clifford.
Clifford? Yes. Certainly.
I don't have it on the list.
What?
I'm not trying to be rude, but if I don't have you on the list I can't let you in.
I don't think you have to try.
Pardon? You don't have to try.
Are women's wear here yet?
How about the retailers?
Women's wear? Are they here... women's wear is here.
Ten minutes, the show is gonna start?
Yes. Five minutes.
Five minutes. That's good.
We're right about to start.
Go get your seat. Yes, okay.
Girls, you're in your first look?
They're gonna see me naked backstage?
 You look heavenly.
Sexy.
Well, a little bit. It's like... "playboy" Mizrahi.
Isaac, why do you always give me the flat shoes and you always give Naomi Campbell high heels?
You gave me slippers for my finale last season!
She wouldn't take them!
Every single time! Oh, shut up!
Do you have something against white women?
Because you have to speak up, lovey!
I did, for my finale; I said, you ain't givin' me slippers... I had slippers last time!
I've got the same problem.
Heels, heels, heels!
All right, where we goin'?
What do we do...
Let's just get it started.
Go music!
I'm serious. Go music.
Let's go! Let's go!
Just get lost!
Go! ¶¶
It's getting sheer, girls.
¶¶
¶¶ they can see us now, right?
¶¶ girls!
¶¶ we're starting now!
¶¶ Where is Linda?
Has anybody...
¶ Oh, you make me feel ¶

Take it off, Cindy!
¶¶ help me. Help me.
¶¶ - Out! Out! Clear out!
Wait a minute!
¶¶ Major lint!
¶¶ Get the major lints off!
Isaac don't like major lint.
¶¶ Sweetie, that thing is in my fucking face...
¶¶ all the time, sweetie!
¶¶ Isaac, call them and get a coat!
¶¶ oww!
¶¶ Paul, you pervert!
You pervert!
¶¶ go!
¶¶ Together? Together, but don't walk together; Walk stag!
¶¶ The three of you go out, and then you...

The scrim worked.
I just wanna have a very dry Martini right now.
I loved it, I loved it.
It was... it was...
The quintessential Isaac.
It was witty and warm and colorful and beautiful.
¶ Company life is company ¶
¶ love is company ¶
¶ company ¶¶

¶¶
Is Nina awake or asleep?
She did? Pass the phone over.
Hon?
Fantastic.
Isn't that thrilling? I just had to call you and tell you that, 'cause... it says "Isaac Mizrahi, mad about you."
It's a big picture on one page, thank God, and it says,
"Isaac Mizrahi really knows how to put on a show... " do you want me to read it to you?
"Mizrahi had some tough going in recent seasons,
"and with this collection he pulled everything together like the Isaac of old...
"the energy, excitement, ideas and the joy.
"He started by turning the lights up behind the scrim,

"He had said this collection would be insane with color and he wasn't kidding.
By and large, the man's

They gave it to me.
This is great.
This is really great.
Hallelujah.
Oh, my God, I feel like marlo Thomas or something.
The thing is, it's great.
That's all. I'm really happy.
Is it worth it?
Yup. It was worth it.
It's always worth it.
Even when it sucks, it's worth it.
I don't believe it.
I would throw my hat up in the air, but you don't wanna see my hair today, this early in the morning.

Tammy Faye: I THINK THE EYES
ARE SO IMPORTANT.
I BELIEVE THEY ARE
THE EYES OF THE SOUL.
I TRULY DO.
AND I THINK YOU CAN
LOOK IN SOMEONE'S EYES
AND REALLY TELL
WHAT KIND OF A PERSON
AND WHAT THEIR HEART IS.
AND SO WHEN MY PRECIOUS
FRIENDS DIE,
I ALWAYS ASK IF I COULD
PLEASE HAVE THEIR GLASSES.
WHEN MY MOM DIED,
I GOT MY MAMA'S GLASSES,
AND THEY'RE VERY,
VERY PRECIOUS TO ME.
I LIKE TO PUT THEM ON
SOMETIMES AND THINK,
"YOU KNOW, MAMA
LOOKED THROUGH THESE.
RuPaul: TAMMY FAYE
IS THE FIRST LADY OF
RELIGIOUS BROADCASTING.
TOGETHER, WITH HER
HUSBAND JIM BAKKER,
SHE PIONEERED
THE ELECTRIC CHURCH.
FROM THE SIXTIES
THROUGH THE MID-EIGHTIES,
THEY BUILT NOT ONE,
BUT 3 RELIGIOUS NETWORKS,
GROWING THE MEDIUM
FROM A MOTLEY GROUP
OF LOCAL STATIONS
INTO A GLOBAL CONCERN.
AT THEIR PEAK, THEY
PRESIDED OVER THE LARGEST
AND MOST SUCCESSFUL
CHRISTIAN TELEVISION
MINISTRY OF ITS DAY.
THEIR CHRISTIAN RETREAT,
HERITAGE U.S.A.,
WAS, AFTER DISNEY WORLD
AND DISNEYLAND,
AMERICA'S MOST POPULAR
THEME PARK.
THEN, IN THE MID-EIGHTIES,
THEIR WORLD CAME
CRASHING DOWN.
Reporter: TROUBLES
FOR JIM BAKKER BEGAN
WITH THE REVELATION
OF HIS SEXUAL ENCOUNTER
WITH JESSICA HAHN.
Second reporter:
TAMMY BAKKER CAME
OUT OF THE CLOSET
TO REVEAL HERSELF
AS A DRUG ADDICT.
WE DID NOT ASK
JERRY FALWELL
TO TAKE OVER
OUR MINISTRY.
Third reporter:
THE MINISTRY IS NOW STRUGGLING
WITH A $16-MILLION DEBT.
THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY
COURT IS NOW...
Fourth reporter:
THE GOVERNMENT SAID BAKKER
WAS A SLICK CON MAN,
CHEATING HIS FOLLOWERS
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
RuPaul: WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO TAMMY FAYE?
12 LONG YEARS AFTER
HER FALL FROM GRACE,
TAMMY LIVES
IN VIRTUAL EXILE
IN A GATED COMMUNITY
IN PALM DESERT, CALIFORNIA.
Tammy: OK, I'M GOING
TO READ YOU MY POEM.
ARE YOU READY?
"LONELINESS CLINGS TO ME
LIKE A SECOND SKIN,
"THREATENING
TO SMOTHER ME
FROM WITHIN.
"WHY GET READY
FOR THE DAY?
"WHAT DOES IT MATTER
TO MYSELF, I SAY?
"MY BODY ACHES ALL NIGHT,
ALL DAY,
"AND I'M TOO TIRED
TO EVEN PRAY.
"MUNDANE HOUSEHOLD
CHORES I DO,
"VACUUM FLOORS
AND PICK UP POO.
"I TRY NOT TO THINK
OF DAYS GONE BY,
"TO DO SO ONLY
MAKES ME CRY.
WHY ME, GOD, I SAY,
WHY?"
IT'S A LITTLE
DRAMATIC, I GUESS,
BUT IT'S HOW I FELT
AT THE TIME.
I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT
I SHOULD PROBABLY
BE ON BROADWAY--
[LAUGHS]
WITH ALL MY DRAMA.
Both:...
WHEN SHE WAS BORN,
SHE HAD PERFECTLY
MANICURED FINGERNAILS.
RuPaul: THE ELDEST
OF 8 CHILDREN,
TAMMY FAYE LaVALLEY
GREW UP IN INTERNATIONAL
FALLS, MINNESOTA.
Virginia Fairchild:
THEIR HOUSE WAS BIG
ENOUGH FOR ALL OF THEM,
BUT NOT A NICE ONE.
IN THOSE DAYS,
YOU DIDN'T SPEND MONEY
FOR ANYTHING
BUT FOOD AND CLOTHES,
BECAUSE YOU JUST DIDN'T
HAVE IT, YOU KNOW?
I DON'T THINK SHE HAD
A VERY HAPPY...
GROWING-UP YEARS,
YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, WHAT DID
SHE REALLY HAVE TO BE
OVERLY OVERJOYED ABOUT?
I MEAN, HELPING
TAKE CARE OF KIDS, YEAH,
BECAUSE SHE HAD TO.
RuPaul: BUT EVEN
IN HER TEENS,
TAMMY HAD HER FAITH
TO TURN TO.
SHE HAD A LITTLE WART
ON ONE FINGER.
SHE ASKED GOD,
AND THE MESSAGE
THAT SHE GOT WAS,
"PUT THAT FINGER
IN THE COMMUNION CUP
BEFORE YOU DRINK."
AND SHE BROUGHT IT OUT,
PARTOOK OF THE BREAD
AND THE JUICE,
AND THE WART WAS GONE.
WE HAD BEEN RAISED IN
THE ASSEMBLIES OF GOD.
AND WE ALWAYS
SORT OF FELT
THE ASSEMBLIES OF GOD
PREACHED THAT
GOD WAS LOOKING DOWN
AT YOU FROM HEAVEN
WITH A BIG HUGE
HAMMER IN HIS HAND
AND THAT IF YOU DID
ANYTHING WRONG,
HE WAS GOING TO HIT YOU
OVER THE HEAD WITH
THIS HAMMER
AND SEND YOU
STRAIGHT TO HELL.
Johnny Grover:
SHE WAS ALMOST SCARED
INTO STAYING CLOSE TO GOD.
I STILL SAY ADA DEHREN
IS HER SAVIOR,
BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ONE
THAT BOUGHT THE MAKE-UP
AT THE RUMMAGE SALE.
[LAUGHS] THEY WERE
THE FIRST ONES TO TRY MAKE-UP.
SEE ALL THIS STUFF?
LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF.
THAT'S MY BLUSH.
IT'S ALMOST GONE.
I GOT TO GO
TO THE SWAP MEET
AND GET SOME MORE.
I BUY IT AT
THE SWAP MEET.
MY POWDER THAT
KIND OF--
WHEN I CRY,
IT TAKES AWAY THE TEARS.
THIS IS MY
EYEBROW STUFF,
ALTHOUGH I DON'T
REALLY NEED TO PUT ON
EYEBROW STUFF,
BECAUSE ME EYEBROWS
ARE PERMANENT.
THIS TURNS PINK
WHEN YOU PUT IT ON.
SEE? BUT IT'S WHITE
TO START WITH.
EYELASH GLUE.
OH, HERE'S--
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.
OH, HERE'S MY MASCARA
THAT I'M SO FAMOUS FOR.
AS YOU SEE, IT IS
L'OREAL WATERPROOF
LASH OUT MAKE-UP.
AND, UM, AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT'S MUCH USED.
MUCH LOVED.
THEY ARE PUT ON SINGLY,
AND, UH, WITH LOTS
OF MASCARA.
THEY DON'T COME OFF,
I MEAN, THEY'RE...
THEY HAVE TO,
LITERALLY,
KIND OF WEAR OFF.
AND SO, ONCE IN A WHILE,
ONE WILL DROP OFF,
AND WHEN IT DOES,
I PUT ANOTHER ONE IN.
WITHOUT MY EYELASHES,
I WOULDN'T BE TAMMY FAYE.
I DON'T KNOW WHO I'D BE,
BUT I WOULDN'T BE ME.
RuPaul: IN 1960, AGED 17,
TAMMY WENT TO BIBLE COLLEGE
WHERE SHE MET
AND FELL IN LOVE
WITH A YOUNG, CHARISMATIC
PREACHER NAMED JIM BAKKER.
THE NEXT YEAR,
ON APRIL FOOL'S DAY,
JIM AND TAMMY WERE MARRIED.
THE YOUNG NEWLYWEDS
LIVED ON THE ROAD,
STRUGGLING TO MAKE A LIVING
AS ITINERANT PREACHERS,
JOINING A TRADITION OF
TRAVELING EVANGELISM
PIONEERED BY MINISTERS
LIKE ORAL ROBERTS.
EVERYTHING THAT'S
EVERY BEEN DONE
THAT'S WORTHWHILE
HAS BEEN DONE BY MEN,
BY WOMEN WHO SAID,
"I DON'T CARE WHAT
THE COST IS,
I'M GOING TO DO THIS
FOR THE GLORY OF GOD."
RuPaul: A BLEND
OF CHRISTIANITY
AND SHOWMANSHIP,
IT WAS A GROWING TREND
THAT WOULD CULMINATE
IN THE CREATION
OF TELEVANGELISM...
THE ELECTRIC CHURCH.
TODAY, IT BOASTS OVER
2,500 RADIO AND TV STATIONS,
REACHING AN
ESTIMATED AUDIENCE
OF 20 MILLION PEOPLE.
SATELLITES CIRCLE THE GLOBE,
BEAMING OUT THOUSANDS
OF PROGRAMS
24 HOURS A DAY,
7 DAYS A WEEK,
AND GENERATING MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE.
Announcer: THE CHRISTIAN
SHOPPING NETWORK.
THE ONLY NETWORK WHERE
YOU SOW THE KINGDOM OF GOD,
WHILE YOU PURCHASE
YOUR FAVORITE PRODUCTS
AT LOWER THAN RETAIL PRICE...
RuPaul: BUT IT ALL
STARTED OUT WITH PUPPETS,
JIM AND TAMMY'S PUPPETS.
OH, YEAH, WE PRACTICALLY
STARTED THE ELECTRIC CHURCH.
WE HAD BOUGHT SILKY
BUBBLE BATH, OF ALL THINGS,
AND WE SAW THESE LITTLE
HEADS ON THE BUBBLE BATH,
AND I--I STARTED
TALKING FOR THEM.
YOU KNOW, MAKING
LITTLE VOICES.
[IN A SILLY VOICE]
"HELLO, THERE."
THOSE KINDS OF
LITTLE VOICES.
AND JIM SAID, "TAMMY,
WE COULD MAKE PUPPETS
OUT OF THESE THINGS,
AND WE COULD USE THEM
IN CHURCH FOR THE KIDS."
WE TOOK THE SILKY
BUBBLE BATH, IT WAS PORKY PIG,
WE MELTED THE EARS DOWN
AND MADE A LITTLE GIRL PIGGY.
SHE HAD TO HAVE A FRIEND,
SO WE MADE AN ALLIGATOR
THAT TALKED LIKE THIS,
[LOW-PITCHED VOICE]
"HELLO.
I'M ALLIE THE ALLIGATOR.
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
"AND I'M SUSIE MUPPET."
I WORKED THEM WITH
MY HANDS, LIKE THIS.
THIS WAS THEIR LITTLE HANDS,
AND THIS WAS THEIR HEAD.
♪ JESUS TAKES A FROWN ♪
♪ AND HE TURNS IT
UPSIDE DOWN ♪
♪ AND OOPS! ♪
♪ HERE COMES
A SMILE... ♪
RuPaul: SUSIE MUPPET
AND ALLIE THE ALLIGATOR
ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF
TV MINISTER PAT ROBERTSON.
HE RAN A SMALL LOCAL STATION
AND DREAMT OF
BUILDING A CHRISTIAN
BROADCASTING NETWORK.
Jim Bakker:
WE GOT A CALL
FROM PAT ROBERTSON.
HE WANTED
TO MEET WITH US.
AND HE SAID,
"WOULD YOU CONSIDER
JOINING THE NETWORK?"
WELL, THE NETWORK
WAS ONE STATION,
A ONE-KILOWATT
TELEVISION STATION.
IT HARDLY WENT DOWN
THE BLOCK AT TIMES.
Announcer:
IT'S TIME FOR THE NATIONS
BIGGEST YARD PARTY,
THE JIM & TAMMY SHOW.
HI, EVERYBODY!
All: HI,
JIM AND TAMMY!
Jim Bakker: WE DID NOT
HAVE A SCRIPT,
SO EVERYTHING WAS
REALLY AD-LIBBED.
I THINK JIM, ACTUALLY,
WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS
AROUND THE PUPPETS,
BECAUSE HE NEVER REALLY KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO SAY.
JIM, YOU JUST ATE
MY SHRIMP UP.
[GASPS] OH, I WAS
JUST STANDING HERE--
SHUT UP!
Jim: SUSIE WAS
THE BAD TAMMY FAYE,
AND ALLIE WAS ALWAYS
SOMEHOW--
SHE HAD A SPLIT
PERSONALITY,
'CAUSE ALLIE WAS
ALWAYS NICE TO ME,
BUT SUSIE MUPPET WAS
ALWAYS ARGUING WITH ME.
AND I MEAN, IF THOSE
PEOPLE AT HOME,
I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY KNEW...
WE WERE HAVING
LEGITIMATE FIGHTS,
ONLY WE WERE DOING IT
THROUGH THESE PUPPETS.
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
THE SHOW BECAME
THE NUMBER ONE PROGRAM
ON C.B.N.
♪ I'M GOING
TO LOVE MY ENEMIES ♪
♪ DO GOOD TO THOSE
WHO ARE BAD TO ME ♪
♪ GOING TO LOVE... ♪
I MEAN,
WHAT DID JIM HENSON HAVE
BUT JIM AND TAMMY
GONE BERSERK.
♪ SO GOOD AND FREE ♪
♪ SO GOOD AND FREE ♪
RuPaul: JIM AND TAMMY
HAD AGREED TO WORK
FOR PAT ROBERTSON
ON CONDITION THAT
THEY COULD ALSO START
A LATE-NIGHT TALK SHOW.
HE SAID, "I'LL MAKE
A DEAL WITH YOU.
"IF YOU GET THE KID SHOW
UP AND RUNNING,
THEN YOU CAN DO THIS
LATE-NIGHT SHOW."
AND SO PAT HONORED
HIS WORD ON THAT,
AND JIM STARTED
WHAT WAS CALLED THE 700 CLUB,
THE FIRST CHRISTIAN
TALK SHOW IN HISTORY.
Announcer: SO HERE'S
YOUR HOST ON...
HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO THE 700 CLUB TODAY.
I'M SO VERY,
VERY HAPPY THAT
YOU COULD JOIN US
FOR THIS PROGRAM
OF PRAYER AND PRAISE.
RuPaul: THE INSTANT
SUCCESS OF THE 700 CLUB
AND THE JIM AND TAMMY SHOW,
HELPED TURN THE CHRISTIAN
BROADCAST NETWORK
FROM A LOCAL STATION
INTO A FULL-FLEDGED NETWORK.
BUT THINGS BEGAN TO SOUR.
Tammy: PAT BEGAN TO WANT
TO TAKE OVER SOME OF
THE 700 CLUB,
WHICH WAS FINE,
BECAUSE IT WAS HIS STATION
AND WE HONORED HIM FOR THAT.
AND SO, WE JUST SAID, "PAT,
"YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT
BY YOURSELF NOW.
YOU DON'T NEED US."
AND SO WE DECIDED TO MOVE ON
AND DO OUR OWN THING.
THE 700 CLUB TODAY
IS PROBABLY
THE MOST POWERFUL
OF THE RELIGIOUS
BROADCASTS.
Announcer: THIS IS...
Reverend White:
AND JIM WAS THE FIRST
HOST ON THE 700 CLUB,
BEFORE
PAT ROBERTSON WAS.
RuPaul: TAMMY WROTE
TO PAT ROBERTSON
ASKING HIM TO BE INTERVIEWED
FOR THIS DOCUMENTARY.
HE DECLINED.
JIM AND TAMMY THEN MOVED
WEST TO CALIFORNIA,
AND IN THE KITCHEN
OF THEIR RENTED HOME
WITH THEIR FRIENDS
JAN AND PAUL CROUCH,
THEY LAUNCHED
A NEW VENTURE:
THE TRINITY BROADCAST
NETWORK.
Tammy: JIM WAS THE HOST,
AND I WAS THE CO-HOST,
AND JAN AND PAUL WERE
IN THE BACKGROUND.
RuPaul: BUT NOT FOR LONG.
JIM AND TAMMY
WERE FORCED OUT
IN A BOARD-ROOM COUP
BY JAN AND PAUL CROUCH.
Announcer: THIS IS THE TRINITY
BROADCASTING NETWORK,
CELEBRATING OUR
25th ANNIVERSARY.
RuPaul: TODAY,
THE CROUCHS STILL PRESIDE
OVER THE MINISTRY JIM
AND TAMMY STARTED WITH THEM,
WHICH HAS SINCE
BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LARGEST TV MINISTRIES.
JIM AND TAMMY STARTED
ALMOST EVERYTHING
THAT IS NOW POWERFUL IN
RELIGIOUS TELECASTING.
BUT AS SOON AS
THEY GOT IT BUILT,
LIKE AT TBN,
AS SOON AS THEY GOT
PEOPLE WATCHING,
AS SOON AS THEY GOT
THE AUDIENCE CAPTIVATED,
AS SOON AS THEY BEGAN
TO GET POWER,
THEY WERE,
KIND OF, LET GO.
RuPaul: TAMMY WROTE
TO THE CROUCHS
ASKING THEM
TO BE INTERVIEWED
FOR THIS DOCUMENTARY.
THEY DECLINED.

RuPaul:
PTL EMBRACED THOSE
THAT OTHER CHRISTIAN
FUNDAMENTALISTS
AND TELEVANGELISTS
REJECTED.
STEVE IS A PATIENT
OF AIDS,
AND HE SO GENEROUSLY
ALLOWED US TO TALK
TO HIM TODAY.
WAS IT JUST
A WORD TO YOU?
IS IT SOMETHING
THAT JUST HAPPENS
TO OTHER PEOPLE
AND NOT TO STEVE?
I KNEW THAT IT WAS
A GROWING PROBLEM
IN THE GAY COMMUNITY,
BUT I, AS MANY OTHER PEOPLE
DID BACK IN 1981 AND '82,
DENIED THAT
IT COULD TOUCH ME.
I MEAN,
WE DIDN'T SEE HOW--
I MEAN,
WHY WOULD IT HURT ME?
I WAS A GOOD
CHRISTIAN PASTOR.
DO YOU KNOW HOW
EARLY THAT WAS
FOR ANYBODY IN
THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
TO BE REACHING OUT
AND TO BE EMBRACING
A GAY PERSON,
LET ALONE
A PERSON WITH AIDS?
TAMMY BAKKER DID IT
WHEN NO ONE ELSE
WOULD DO IT.
HOW SAD THAT
WE AS CHRISTIANS,
WHO ARE TO BE
THE SALT OF THE EARTH,
AND WE ARE--WE,
WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
ABLE TO LOVE EVERYONE,
ARE AFRAID SO BADLY
OF AN AIDS PATIENT
THAT WE WILL NOT
GO UP AND PUT OUR
ARM AROUND THEM
AND TELL THEM
THAT WE CARE?
RuPaul: WHETHER
IT WAS AIDS, DRUG ABUSE,
OR MARRIAGE COUNSELING,
PTL, AND IN PARTICULAR
TAMMY,
RUSHED IN WHERE OTHER
CHRISTIAN BROADCASTERS
FEARED TO TREAD.
THE PENILE IMPLANT
OF THE INFLATABLE TYPE,
AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT
WE'RE LOOKING AT--
IT'S THE NEWEST ONE, RIGHT?
THIS IS THE NEWEST ONE
OUT THERE.
WHEN HE WANTS
TO BECOME ERECT,
HE REACHES DOWN,
HE SQUEEZES THAT
SEVERAL TIMES,
AND THE MAN
BECOMES FIRM.
I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC.
NOW GO AHEAD, AUDIENCE,

Announcer:

THAT'S WHY LATER ON,
THE PLUM THAT SO MANY
PEOPLE WANTED
WAS THAT SATELLITE.

SATISFIED WITH JUST
A TELEVISION NETWORK.
Tammy:
JIM FELT THAT IF THE PEOPLE
WERE THERE ON THE GROUNDS
AND COULD COME AND STAY
WHERE PTL WAS AND SEE,
AND GET IN ON THE VISION...
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED.
HE WANTED ALL THE PEOPLE
TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BE THERE.
RuPaul:
TO REALIZE THIS VISION,
JIM BAKKER CONTACTED HIS
CHURCH BUILDER ROE MESSNER.
Roe: I GOT ON A PLANE
AND WENT DOWN
TO CHARLOTTE,
MET WITH JIM,
AND HE LAID OUT THIS
GRANDIOSE PLAN
THAT HE HAD FOR
2,500 ACRES
AND WANTED TO KNOW
IF I WOULD, UH,
DESIGN HIS BUILDINGS
AND BE HIS CONTRACTOR.
RuPaul:
WHAT JIM ENVISIONED
WAS NOTHING LESS THAN
A CHRISTIAN DISNEYLAND,
A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR
RESORT
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY
INCLUDE A 500-ROOM HOTEL,
A STATE-OF-THE-ART

ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION
OF A YOUNG REPORTER
AT THE LOCAL PAPER,
THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER.
I HAD BEEN REPORTING ON PTL

YES, JIM.
IT'S BEEN GOING ON

"PTL PRESIDENT JIM BAKKER

A SPORTS CAR,

I HAVE ALL
THE CANCELLED CHECKS.
I'LL HAVE TO PICK 'EM

PROPEL HIS MINISTRY FORWARD,
AND IT THEN BECAME
A VERY CONVENIENT WAY

SOME STATEMENTS

Charles: IN 1980, ONE OF HIS

HAD ARRANGED
AN ENCOUNTER IN A HOTEL ROOM
WITH A WOMAN
NAMED JESSICA HAHN,
A YOUNG WOMAN,
I THINK, IN HER EARLY 20s.
AND THAT LED TO
A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER
OF SOME KIND OR ANOTHER.
THERE'S A DISPUTE
OVER WHAT EXACTLY
HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM.
THAT DAY ALL MY DREAMS
WERE SHATTERED
AND MY LIFE WOULD NEVER
BE THE SAME.
Charles: IN EARLY 1985...
PTL AGREED TO SETTLE
A THREATENED LAWSUIT
BY JESSICA HAHN
BY PAYING HER
A SUM OF MONEY.
RuPaul: ONCE AGAIN,
THE PTL NETWORK
TURNED TO ROE MESSNER,
APPARENTLY WITHOUT
JIM'S KNOWLEDGE.
Roe: THEY CAME TO ME AND
SAID WE GOT A PROBLEM.
WE'VE MADE AN AGREEMENT
WITH THIS LADY
THAT IF WE
PAY HER $265,000,
SHE'LL GO AWAY.
AND I SAID THAT'S
NOT THE WAY TO DO THAT.
I SAID YOU
SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
I SAID, "I'LL LOAN
YOU THE MONEY,
BUT," I SAYS,
"IT'S A LOAN.
I WANT THE MONEY
PAID BACK."
RuPaul: UNAWARE
OF JIM'S SECRET,
TAMMY FAYE WAS STRUGGLING
WITH HER OWN.
JOIN THE PTL CLUB,
AND TAMMY WANTS TO
SEND YOU A COPY OF HER BOOK
HOW TO OVERCOME FEAR.
Tammy: I BECAME
VERY NERVOUS,
SO I WENT
TO THE DOCTOR
WITH A
HYPERVENTILATION
PROBLEM,
AND THEY KNEW
IT WAS A CASE OF
NERVOUS FRUSTRATION.
AND SO THEY
GAVE ME A LITTLE
PILL CALLED ADAVAN.
AND ADAVAN...
WAS A WONDERFUL DRUG
FOR ME AT THE TIME.
I DIDN'T TAKE
MY MEDICINE TODAY
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO BE BRIGHT.
YESTERDAY,
I ALMOST FELL OFF
MY HIGH HEELS.
I WAS ON MEDICINE,
TAKING MY MEDICINE,
SO I'M NOT SAYING--
THIS WAS HER WAY OF
DEALING WITH THE STRESS
THAT SHE WAS UNDER
IN THE RELATIONSHIP.
AND SHE WOULD
LITERALLY LOSE TRACK
OF THE NUMBER OF ADAVAN
THAT SHE WOULD TAKE.
TAMMY, I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO SING A SONG FOR US.
I'M BACK HERE LOOKING
AT THE BOAT, JIM.
ISN'T THIS
A MAGNIFICENT THING?
YES.
RIGHT HERE
ON OUR BEACH.
IT LOOKS BRAND NEW.
I BET--
I'M GONNA TAKE
MY SHOES OFF AND
WADE IN THE WATER.
I DON'T THINK THAT
BOAT'S EVER SEEN WATER.
[GIGGLING]
I FINALLY GOT
TO THE POINT
WHERE I HAD
TO HAVE ADAVAN
WITH ME AT ALL TIMES.
RuPaul:
THEN TAMMY OVERDOSED.
Tammy: WE HAD JUST
BROKEN GROUND
FOR ONE OF THE BUILDINGS
THAT WE WERE GETTING
READY TO BUILD.
IT WAS GOING TO BE
A FOOTBALL FIELD LONG.
AND WE HAD
BROKEN GROUND.
THE DAY WAS
VERY, VERY COLD,
AND NONE OF US HAD
WORN PROPER CLOTHING.
AND I GOT PNEUMONIA
AS A RESULT OF THAT.
THEY SAID THAT I HAD
ENOUGH ADAVAN IN ME
THAT WOULD'VE KILLED
A HUGE TRUCK DRIVER.
RuPaul: TAMMY WAS RUSHED
ON A FRIEND'S PRIVATE JET
TO EISENHOWER MEDICAL CENTER
IN PALM SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA.
ON THE AIRPLANE I WENT
INTO HALLUCINATIONS.
IT-IT'S PLEASANT.
IT IS PLEASANT
WHEN YOU'RE IN A
DRUG-INDUCED STATE OF MIND.
I MEAN, YOU CAN SIT
AND WATCH WONDERFUL THINGS,
AND I SAW CARTOONS.
BUT THEN
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN YOU SEE REALLY
HORRIBLE THINGS, TOO.
I SAW THESE MEN WITH
THESE BLACK CAPES ON.
I SAW THEM COMING
AT ME IN DROVES.
RuPaul: ONCE ON THE PLANE,
TAMMY TRIED TO DISEMBARK
AT 30,000 FEET.
Tammy: THEY TOOK ME
FROM THE HOSPITAL
DIRECTLY TO
THE BETTY FORD CENTER.
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING
PUNISHED FOR SOMETHING,
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS BEING PUNISHED FOR.
IT STILL HURTS ME...
THAT THEY DID NOT
TELL ME THEY WERE
GONNA DO THAT TO ME.
SHE SPENT ONE NIGHT
THERE AND THEN LEFT.
ALL I NEEDED
WAS TO BE EDUCATED,
BECAUSE I'M
AN INTELLIGENT PERSON,
AND THAT'S ALL I NEEDED.
ONCE I WAS EDUCATED
AND REALIZED WHAT I WAS DOING,
I STOPPED IT
AND I HAVE NEVER, EVER
HAVE HAD TO--HAVE--HAVE,
UH...BEEN ADDICTED
TO ANYTHING AGAIN.
JUST DIET COKE.
BUT THE PRESIDENT
LIKES IT, TOO,
SO I'M
IN GOOD COMPANY.
[BLEEP]
Both: HEE HEE HEE HEE.
I WENT AWAY
FOR A WHILE,
AND I HAVE LEARNED
THE BEST LESSON
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
I LEARNED HOW MUCH
I LOVED MY HUSBAND,
HOW MUCH I CARED
FOR MY HUSBAND.
AND I LEARNED
A LESSON OF LONELINESS
SUCH AS I'VE NEVER
FELT IN MY LIFE.
WHEN I HAD TO
GO OUT ALL OF A SUDDEN
AND GO BY MYSELF
AND DO MY WASHING
TO A PLACE WHERE
I DIDN'T EVEN--
WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH,
WHEN I HAD TO CARRY OUT MY
OWN GARBAGE,
WHEN I HAD TO DO
ALL THE THINGS
THAT I DID WITH
SOMEONE I LOVED BEFORE,
WHEN I HAD TO
DO IT ALL BY MYSELF,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I REALIZED
THAT THERE WAS
A LOT MORE TO MARRIAGE
THAN JUST THE SPARKLES.
RuPaul: JIM AND TAMMY
DECIDED TO STAY IN THEIR
HOME IN PALM SPRINGS
AND PUT THEIR MARRIAGE
BACK TOGETHER,
BUT THINGS
TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY.
THE THING I REMEMBER
MOST ABOUT THIS HOUSE,
I BELIEVE,
IS THE WIND.
WE USED TO GO UP
ON TOP OF THE ROOF
OF THE GARAGE
AND LISTEN TO
THE WIND BLOWING THROUGH
THE PALM TREES AT NIGHT.
AND THE MOON WOULD BE OUT.
IT WOULD BE SO BEAUTIFUL
HERE IN THE DESERT.
THIS IS THE HOUSE
WHERE OUR WHOLE LIVES
CAME TUMBLING DOWN ON US.
I WAS STILL VERY WEAK
AND VERY SICK
WHEN I FINISHED
THE BETTY FORD PROGRAM.
AND JIM WAS
REALLY BURNED OUT,
HAVING TO RAISE
$1 MILLION A WEEK
TO KEEP PTL ON THE AIR,
AND TO KEEP ALL
THE BILLS PAID.
Jim: IT WAS BEGINNING
TO CRUSH ME.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I WOULD LITERALLY
HAVE TO THINK TO WALK.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT I'D HAVE TO--
I WAS SO EXHAUSTED,
I'D HAVE TO, YOU KNOW--
USUALLY YOUR BODY WILL
JUST WALK BY ITSELF,
BUT I'M HAVING
TO PICK UP MY FEET
ON PURPOSE TO WALK.
AND SO JERRY FALWELL
KNEW JUST WHEN TO HIT.
RuPaul: ALTHOUGH JIM AND
TAMMY WERE THE MOST POPULAR
EVANGELISTS OF THEIR TIME,
SOUTHERN BAPTIST MINISTER
JERRY FALWELL WAS
THE MOST POWERFUL.
HE WAS THE FOUNDER
OF THE MORAL MAJORITY
AND PLAYED A KEY ROLE
IN REAGAN'S ELECTION.
HE PREACHED A RETURN
TO FAMILY VALUES
AND SINGLED OUT
THE PRO-ABORTION AND
GAY MOVEMENTS FOR ATTACK.
FALWELL'S EMPIRE
INCLUDED A SUCCESSFUL
TELEVISION MINISTRY
AND A UNIVERSITY,
BUT IT DID NOT
INCLUDE A SATELLITE.
HE CALLS JIM UP
AND HE SAYS,
"JIM, I HAVE FOUND
SOMETHING OUT THAT
I AM GOING TO--
"THAT IS GOING TO BE
LEAKED TO THE NEWSPAPERS
"IF YOU DON'T
ALLOW ME TO HELP YOU."
HE SAYS, "LET ME FLY OUT
TO CALIFORNIA,
AND I WANT TO HELP YOU
AND TAMMY THROUGH THIS."
AND THEN HE BROUGHT UP
THE NAME JESSICA HAHN.
THIS IS WHERE
I HEARD JIM TELL ME
THAT HE HAD HAD
A ONE-NIGHT STAND
WITH A YOUNG LADY
BY THE NAME OF JESSICA HAHN.
EVEN THOUGH IT HAD
HAPPENED 9 YEARS BEFORE,
TO ME, IT WAS LIKE
IT HAD HAPPENED YESTERDAY.
I LAID ON THE FLOOR
AND I CRIED FOR 3 DAYS.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT
HAD HAPPENED TO MY LIFE.
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO SOLVE IT.
RuPaul: TAMMY WROTE
TO JESSICA HAHN,
ASKING TO MEET WITH HER.
SHE DECLINED.
SHE DID, HOWEVER,
TELL HER SIDE OF THE STORY
IN A 1993 PLAYBOY VIDEO.
I WOULD REALLY
LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW
THERE ARE SIDES
OF MY PERSONALITY
THAT NO ONE HAS SEEN.
I WOULD JUST LIKE PEOPLE
TO KNOW THE REAL ME.
Tammy: JERRY FALWELL
FLEW HIS PRIVATE JET OUT.
HE SAID--HE PUT
HIS ARMS AROUND ME--
"I WANT TO HELP YOU."
AND WITH THAT, HE SAID,
"IF YOU WILL GIVE PTL
TO ME FOR 6 WEEKS,"
HE SAID, "WHILE
THIS STORY BREAKS,
WHICH IS BOUND TO BREAK,"
HE SAID,
"WE WILL BE THE CATALYST,
"AND IN 6 WEEKS,
YOU WILL HAVE
YOUR MINISTRY BACK,
AND IT WILL BE LIKE
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED."
AN ATTACK ON
ONE DENOMINATION
IS AN ATTACK ON ALL.
WE MUST SHARE
THE BREAD OF ADVERSITY
AND THE WATER
OF AFFLICTION.
JIM SWALLOWED IT
HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.
BUT I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE,
AND I BEGGED HIM--
I BEGGED HIM
NOT TO GIVE UP HIS PLACE
ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
I TOLD HIM,
"GO BACK AND TALK TO
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
"GO BACK AND
TALK TO YOUR PEOPLE
BEFORE YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS."
AND JIM SAID, "NO.
"DADDY FALWELL'S HERE.
HE'LL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING."
BY EARLY 1987,
I HAD COLLECTED
THE INFORMATION
I NEEDED TO PUBLISH
A STORY ABOUT JESSICA HAHN
AND ABOUT THAT PAYOFF.
ON MARCH 19, 1987,
IN AN INTERVIEW
WITH US ABOUT THE STORY,
INSTEAD OF AN INTERVIEW,
WE HEARD A RESIGNATION
SPEECH OVER THE TELEPHONE.
JIM WAS IN CALIFORNIA.
HE READ THIS RESIGNATION.
HE GOT OFF THE PHONE
AND IMMEDIATELY
A MAN NAMED
JERRY FALWELL COMES ON,
WHICH IS A SHOCK TO ALL
OF US AT THE NEWSPAPER.
AND FALWELL HAS
BEEN GIVEN BY JIM
THE MANTLE OF RUNNING PTL.
HOW CAN WE SAY THANK YOU
FOR YOU GENTLEMEN
WHO HAVE STOOD
BY JIM AND TAMMY'S SIDE,
AND ALL OF OUR SIDE?
IF OUR ARMS
WERE BIG ENOUGH,
WE'D JUST WRAP THEM
ALL AROUND ALL OF YOU.
WE REALLY WOULD.
Charles: THAT STORY
EXPLODED.
IT WAS THE STORY
FOR NEWSPAPERS
AND TELEVISION
AROUND THE COUNTRY.
ARE YOU PLANNING
ON COMING BACK?
I REMEMBER
GOING TO PTL
AND GOING INTO
THIS NEWS CONFERENCE
THAT FALWELL HELD
AT THE HOTEL,
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
FEELING SOME BLUSH OF PRIDE
AT WHAT MY GOOD REPORTING
HAD CREATED HERE.
Tammy: O.J. SIMPSON
WAS NOTHING
COMPARED TO WHAT
WE HAD AROUND US.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
WE JUST WANTED
TO SAY HELLO,
AND THANK ALL
YOU CAMERAMEN
AND ALL YOU
PRESS PEOPLE.
I HATE IT
YOU HAD TO STAND OUT
IN THIS HOT SUN
IN THIS DESERT.
THEY WERE 4,
5 DEEP FOR THE WHOLE BLOCK,
DOWN ALL AROUND OUR HOUSE.
THERE WAS NO PLACE
FOR US TO HIDE AT ALL.
REMEMBER, I WAS
11 YEARS OLD WHEN
THIS WAS HAPPENING,
BUT I COULD TELL
SOMETHING WAS GOING WRONG.
SHARE WITH US.
HOW'S JAMIE CHARLES
AND TAMMY SUE DOING?
WE'RE CONCERNED.
I WISH YOU'D
STARTED SOMEWHERE ELSE.
[CRYING]
ONE OF THE LAST THING
JAMIE CHARLES SAID IS,
"WILL I GET A CHANCE
TO GO HOME AND GET MY TOYS?"
Man: AW, BLESS HIM.
AND SUSIE'S DOING WELL.
I RAN AWAY
FROM HOME.
WHAT WOULD
ANY TEENAGER DO?
RUN AWAY.
THAT'S THE ANSWER.
YOU KNOW.
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.
RuPaul: ON JUNE 11, 1987,
JIM AND TAMMY
WENT ON THE AIR
TO ADDRESS THE PTL AUDIENCE
FOR WHAT WOULD BE
THE LAST TIME.
TAMMY AND I ARE
SO VERY GLAD
THAT WE'VE
BEEN GRANTED
THIS OPPORTUNITY
TO TALK
WITH YOU TODAY.
AND SAY HELLO.
YES. HELLO, EVERYONE.
AND WE WANT
TO SAY TO YOU
THAT WE ARE SO
VERY, VERY SORRY.
I BELIEVE, TAMMY,
'CAUSE THE GOD I
SERVE IS STILL GOD,
I BELIEVE THE SUN
WILL SHINE AGAIN.
OH, I DO, TOO, JIM.
YOU WANT TO SING IT?
I'LL DO IT.
CAN YOU DO IT?
ALL RIGHT,
TAMMY FAYE IS GONNA
SING A SONG FOR YOU
JUST BEFORE
WE LEAVE OUR HOUSE.
MAYBE YOU'RE HURTING
AND YOU NEED THIS
SONG TODAY, TOO,
SO, I'LL SING IT
FOR BOTH OF US, OK?
♪ OH, THE SUN
WILL SHINE AGAIN ♪
♪ THE SUN
WILL SHINE AGAIN ♪
♪ OH, THE SUN
WILL SHINE AGAIN ♪
WE CAME IN HERE FIRST
BECAUSE WE FELT
JIM BAKKER WANTED US HERE.
♪ A NEW DAY
WILL BREAK ♪
WE NOW FEEL
A HIGHER CALLING.
WE FEEL THAT GOD
WANTS US HERE,
AT LEAST FOR
THE TIME BEING.
JERRY FALWELL CAME IN
TO RESCUE THE NETWORK,
BUT, IN FACT, TOOK IT.
RESCUE, TAKE,
THEY'RE OPPOSITES.
I FEEL LIKE GOD HAS
FORGIVEN ME OF SO MUCH,
THAT I WILL
FORGIVE EVERYONE
WHO HAS HURT US.
AND SO WE JUST
WANT EVERYONE
TO BEGIN TO
LOVE ONE ANOTHER,
AND THAT THE CHURCH WORLD
WILL LOVE ONE ANOTHER,
THAT THE PEOPLE OF GOD
WILL NOT FIGHT.
OH, I BELIEVE YOUR
MIDNIGHT'S ALMOST OVER.
AND THANK GOD,
THE SUN IS GOING
TO SHINE AGAIN.
PRAISE THE LORD.
[APPLAUSE]
Man: HALLELUJAH!
PRAISE THE LORD!
Roe: JERRY FALWELL
CALLED ME UP,
AND HE SAID, "ROE,
I WANT YOU TO GO OUT
AND SEE
JIM AND TAMMY FOR ME."
HE SAID, "I WANT YOU
TO GO OUT THERE
"AND TELL THEM
I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM
"300,000 SALARY
THIS YEAR.
"I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF
THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE,
"PAY THE PHONE BILL,
"I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM
ONE SECURITY GUARD,
A MAID," HE SAID,
AND YOU KNOW, JUST HAVE
THEM WRITE IT DOWN
ON A PIECE OF PAPER."
ROE, THINKING
THAT FALWELL WAS
AN HONORABLE MAN,
CAME OUT TO OUR
HOUSE AND TOLD US THIS.
AND SO HE SAID,
"TAMMY, YOU NEED TO
JUST GET A PIECE OF PAPER
"AND YOU NEED TO WRITE
DOWN THE LIST OF BENEFITS
"THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
VOTED FOR YOU TO HAVE,
AND MR. FALWELL WANTS
TO CONTINUE THOSE FOR A YEAR."
AND I GAVE JERRY,
I GAVE HIM THIS--
THIS THING
WITH TAMMY'S
PINK STATIONARY.
HE GOES TO THE CAMERA
RIGHT THEN.
WE WERE IN OUR HOME
AND CNN WAS ON,
AND, OF COURSE,
WE WERE WATCHING IT.
JIM AND TAMMY GAVE ME
THIS LIST OF THINGS
THEY'D LIKE TO RECEIVE.
JIM'S SALARY,
FOR A LIFETIME,
AT $300,000 PER YEAR.
TAMMY'S SALARY,
FOR A LIFETIME,
SECRETARY FOR ONE YEAR...
PHONE BILL..2 CARS...
HOUSE ON THE LAKE...
SECURITY...
AND THE FURNITURE.
THEY WANT A MAID.
I DON'T SEE
ANY REPENTANCE THERE.
I SEE THE GREED.
I SEE
THE SELF-CENTEREDNESS.
I SEE THE AVARICE
THAT BROUGHT THEM DOWN.
AND FROM
THAT DAY ON,
HE STARTED--
HE STARTED HIS
ATTACK ON JIM.
THE HOMOSEXUALITY STUFF,
THE DARK HOLE WHERE
ALL THE MONEY'S GONE,
AND ALL THAT BALONEY
THAT HE CAME UP WITH.
I HAVE SAT ACROSS
THE TABLE FROM MEN
WHO HAVE TOLD ME OF THEIR--
OF YOUR HOMOSEXUAL ADVANCES.
AND SINCE THEN, OF COURSE,
I HAVE LEARNED OF THE
FISCAL IRREGULARITIES.
AND JIM, I MUST TELL YOU
THAT I WOULD BE DOING
A DISSERVICE TO GOD,
AS MUCH AS I LOVE
YOU AND CARE FOR YOU,
AND WILL PRAY FOR YOU,
I WOULD BE DOING
A DISSERVICE TO GOD
AND TO THE CHURCH AT LARGE
TO ALLOW YOU TO COME BACK
HERE NOW OR EVER.
JIM, A LOOK
OF PURE HORROR,
PURE TORTURE
PASSED OVER HIS FACE.
AND HE SAID,
"TAM, IT'S ALL OVER.
I'VE BEEN HAD."
Charles: MY SENSE OF
FALWELL AND OF HIS PEOPLE
AND HOW THEY OPERATED WAS
THEY HAD VERY SHARP KNIVES.
AND THE BAKKERS PROBABLY
WERE A LITTLE NAIVE.
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY
HAD EVER RUN INTO ANYONE
WHO WAS QUITE SO CUNNING.
THEY WERE MANIPULATIVE,
AND SCHEMING,
BUT HE WAS CUNNING,
AND I THINK CUNNING
TRUMPED SCHEMING THERE.
RuPaul: LESS THAN 3 MONTHS
AFTER FALWELL TOOK OVER,
PTL FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY.
THOUSANDS OF
PTL PARTNERS, DONORS,
AND CREDITORS
LOST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
Roe: THEY SOLD IT
FOR 25 CENTS
ON THE DOLLAR,
AND THERE JUST
WASN'T ANY MONEY
FOR THE CREDITORS.
I THINK MR. FALWELL
WANTED TO
DESTROY PTL,
IS WHAT I THINK.
I WOULD LOVE TO SIT
AND LOOK JERRY FALWELL
IN THE EYES
AND SAY, "JERRY,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET IT RIGHT WITH GOD
AND SAY YOU'RE SORRY?"
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
MAKE IT RIGHT WITH ME,
BECAUSE I'M NOT IN CHARGE
OF WHETHER JERRY FALWELL'S
GOING TO HEAVEN OR HELL.
THAT'S NOT--I'M NOT
IN CHARGE OF THAT.
BUT I SAY HE HAD BETTER
MAKE IT RIGHT WITH GOD.
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
TO FACE JERRY,
BUT HE WON'T FACE ME.
I KNOW HE WON'T.
RuPaul: FALWELL NEVER
REPLIED TO TAMMY'S LETTER.
HE HAS, HOWEVER,
GONE ON RECORD
CALLING TAMMY A LOONY
WHOSE ELEVATOR NEVER
WENT TO THE TOP FLOOR.
FALWELL ALSO NEVER RESPONDED
TO THE PRODUCER'S REQUEST
FOR AN INTERVIEW.
ELSEWHERE, HOWEVER,
HE HAS DENIED THAT THE LIST
ON TAMMY'S LETTERHEAD
WAS CREATED
AT HIS SUGGESTION.
HE ALSO MAINTAINS
THAT BAKKER ASKED HIM
TO TAKE OVER THE PTL MINISTRY
AND WAS NEVER PROMISED
HE COULD RETURN.
RuPaul: IN 1989, JIM BAKKER
WENT ON TRIAL FOR FRAUD.
Reporter:
THE GOVERNMENT SAID BAKKER
DELIBERATELY SOLD
MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY
PARTNERSHIPS FOR LODGING
AS THERE
WERE ACCOMMODATIONS,
AND POCKETED
NEARLY $4 MILLION
TO KEEP HIM IN
EXPENSIVE HOMES AND CARS.
James Albert: THIS
WAS A FEDERAL TRIAL.
THERE WERE
NO CAMERAS ALLOWED
IN THE COURTROOM.
WE HAD TO RELY ON
THOSE PRINT JOURNALISTS,
AND PARTICULARLY
THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER
REPORTERS.
THEN, OF COURSE,
REMEMBER, THE
CHARLOTTE OBSERVER
WON THE PULITZER PRIZE
FOR PUBLIC SERVICE
FOR TOPPLING JIM BAKKER
AND EXPOSING HIM
ONE FULL YEAR
BEFORE THIS JURY
EVER GOT A CHANCE
TO CONSIDER
ANY OF THIS EVIDENCE.
RuPaul: JAMES ALBERT
SPENT 5 YEARS STUDYING
THE PTL TRIAL,
AND WROTE A BOOK
THAT RAISED QUESTIONS
ABOUT HOW THE TRIAL
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.
WHEN THE DEFENSE
PLAYED A PTL VIDEO
FOR THE JURY TO SEE,
JUDGE POTTER ACTUALLY
STUCK HIS INDEX FINGERS
IN HIS EARS
AND TURNED AWAY.
HE HAS SAID IN
THE COURT MANY TIMES,
"I MAY NOT BE
RULING THIS CORRECTLY,
BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT UP
ON YOUR APPEAL."
AND I FEEL THAT
ANY JUDGE WHO THINKS
THAT WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO APPEAL
HAS ALREADY
MADE UP HIS MIND
THAT WE'RE GUILTY.
THE JUDGE REFUSED
TO ALLOW THE JURORS
TO BOARD A BUS AND TRAVEL
15 MINUTES TO HERITAGE U.S.A.,
TO SEE WHAT
JIM BAKKER HAD BUILT
WITH ALL THE MONEY
THAT HE RAISED.
IT WAS A TRIAL
NOT ABOUT FRAUD
OR CRIMINAL CONDUCT.
IT WAS A TRIAL
ABOUT LIFESTYLE AND WEALTH.
Reporter: PTL's
NEW MANAGEMENT
ACT CONTINUALLY AMAZED
AT THE OPULENCE
UNDER WHICH JIM
AND TAMMY BAKKER LIVED.
IN FACT, A TRIP THROUGH
THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE
AT THE HERITAGE
GRAND HOTEL
SHOWS THE BAKKERS LIVED,
ONE COULD EASILY DEDUCE,
QUITE LUXURIOUSLY.
THEY LIVED WELL,
BUT THEY LIVED
NO BETTER THAN
PAT ROBERTSON,
NO BETTER THAN
JERRY FALWELL,
NO BETTER THAN
JIM DOBSON,
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
IN THEIR HOMES, TOO.
BUT LOOK,
I THINK THE FACT IS
THE BAKKERS HAD BEEN,
FROM PRETTY MUCH
EVERYBODY'S POINT OF VIEW,
PRETTY GREEDY.
IT'S LUDICROUS TO ARGUE
THAT JIM BAKKER
RAISED $158 MILLION
FROM HIS
TELEVISION VIEWERS
TO KEEP $3 MILLION
FOR HIMSELF.
RuPaul: AFTER A 6-WEEK TRIAL,
JIM BAKKER WAS SENTENCED TO
45 YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON.
I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM
BEING TAKEN INTO CUSTODY,
BUT THAT'S VERY MUCH
IN THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION,
AND THE JUDGE
HAS PROVEN HIMSELF
HARD TO PREDICT.
WITH TODAY'S VERDICT,
REALITY HAS FINALLY
DAWNED FOR JIM BAKKER.
TODAY WAS CERTAINLY AN EXAMPLE
OF GOD'S AMAZING GRACE.
THEY DID HIM LIKE
THEY DONE JESUS,
WITH LEADING HIM
LIKE HE'S A BIG
DRUG PUSHER,
A BIG ROBBER
OR SOMETHING.
THEY HAD
HANDCUFFS ON HIM,
LEADING HIM,
AND HE IS
THE MAN OF GOD.
I HAVE A SONG FOR YOU.

RuPaul: THIS
IS THE LAST TIME
TAMMY FAYE WOULD SING
IN PUBLIC FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
MEANWHILE CHARLES SHEPARD
WROTE A BOOK CALLED FORGIVEN,
A SEARING ACCOUNT
OF THE SCANDAL.
[TYPING]
SHEPARD WAS ASKED IF HE
WOULD MET WITH TAMMY FAYE.
HE AGREED.
SO 12 YEARS
AFTER THE VERDICT,
TAMMY CONFRONTED CHARLES
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
I WAS THEIR, CHARLIE.
I KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.
I KNOW JIM BAKKER
IS NOT A CROOK.
I KNOW THAT AFTER
25 YEARS IN FRONT OF
THE TELEVISION CAMERAS,
WE DID NOT STEAL MONEY
AND YOU AND I--
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY,
"YOU STOLE MONEY."
I DON'T FEEL I WROTE THINGS
THAT WERE UNTRUE.
HMM.
CERTAINLY NOT KNOWING
THEY WERE,
AND EVEN NOW, I DON'T KNOW
OF ANYTHING I WROTE
THAT WAS UNTRUE.
MM-HMM.
DID YOU WRITE THAT
MILLIONS WERE MISSING?
I DON'T EVER REMEMBER
WRITING THAT.
YOU SAID--WHAT YOU SAID
WAS A BIG, DEEP HOLE...
MILLIONS MISSING.
W-WHY?
ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS JUST WHY?
WHICH QUESTION
SHOULD I ANSWER FIRST?
ON ALL OF THEM!
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND,
WHAT DID WE DO?
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T--
I'M NOT HERE TO SAY--
A JUDGE AND JURY.
BECAUSE, LISTEN.
I COULD TURN AROUND
AND--AND--AND--AND
PUT PTL DOWN
IF I WANT TO,
JUST LIKE THE NEWS DID,
BUT I WAS THERE
AND I LIVED IT
AND ONE THING I KNOW
ABOUT JIM BAKKER--
HE WAS AN HONEST MAN.
AND ONE THING I KNOW
ABOUT THE PTL ORGANIZATION,
IT WAS AN HONEST,
TRUTHFUL ORGANIZATION.
RuPaul: TAMMY
WANTED AN APOLOGY.
CHARLES WANTED AN AUTOGRAPH.
OH, YEAH. I--I--I...
I BROUGHT SOME COPIES
OF MY BOOK.
HEY, GREAT.
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU,
BUT I WANTED TO GET YOU
TO AUTOGRAPH SOME...
I WILL.
MY SCHOOL HAS GOT
AN AUCTION
FOR THE GRADUATE WOMEN
IN BUSINESS GROUP.
OH, SURE.
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE A KICK
IF I GIVE THEM THAT
TO AUCTION OFF.
OK. ALL RIGHT.
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
GOING TO A SIGNING,
DID YOU, TAMMY?
NO, I DIDN'T.
Man: TAMMY, WHAT
DID YOU WRITE?
HA HA HA!
BUT, HEY, CHARLES,
YOU'RE FORGIVEN.

RuPaul: WITH A HUSBAND
IN PRISON,
A RUNAWAY DAUGHTER,
AND A TROUBLED SON,
TAMMY STRUGGLED
TO MAKE IT ON HER OWN.
BUT IN 1992, JIM AND TAMMY'S
DREAM ENDED...IN DIVORCE.
I WAS TOTALLY ALONE
AND HAD NOTHING, NO ONE.
EVERYONE HAD TURNED
THEIR BACK AGAINST ME
ONE MORE TIME,
AND I FELT LIKE
A WOMAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY.
IT'S SO OFTEN TRUE
THAT CHRISTIANS ARE
ONE ARMY THAT KILLS
THEIR WOUNDED.
HA HA. WE DON'T--
WE DON'T TRY TO NURSE THEM
BACK TO HEALTH.
AND I DON'T KNOW
OF ANY WOMAN IN OUR TIME
WHO HAS BEEN SO RIDICULED,
PUT DOWN, MALIGNED.
REALLY, I EQUATE HER

RuPaul: 18 MONTHS
AFTER HER DIVORCE,
TAMMY SCANDALIZED
THE CHURCH AND THE MEDIA
WHEN SHE REMARRIED.
HER NEW HUSBAND WAS THE MAN
WHO PAID OFF JESSICA HAHN,
THE MAN WHO BUILT
HERITAGE U.S.A.,
AND THE MAN WHO JIM BAKKER
CALLED HIS BEST FRIEND...
ROE MESSNER.
Roe: EVERYBODY
LIKES TO SAY THAT
WAS PLANNED, YOU KNOW,
AND THAT ROE AND TAMMY
HAD THIS BIG DEAL GOING
WHILE HE WAS IN
CHARLOTTE BUILDING PTL.
NONE OF THAT'S TRUE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I...
LIKED TAMMY, YOU KNOW?
AND WE STARTED
TALKING TOGETHER
A LITTLE BIT.
UM...
AND IT JUST
SORT OF HAPPENED
LIKE THAT, REALLY.
RuPaul:
DIVORCED AND REMARRIED,
TAMMY WAS REJECTED
BY CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING,
SO SHE TURNED
TO SECULAR TELEVISION,
COURTING EVEN MORE
CONTROVERSY
BY HOSTING A TALK SHOW
WITH AN OPENLY GAY COHOST.

Jim J.: SHE HAS BEEN JUDGED
BY OTHER PEOPLE
AND SHE KNOWS
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.
SO ALTHOUGH TAMMY'S BELIEFS
ARE NOT IN FAVOR,
I DON'T THINK,
OF HOMOSEXUALITY,
SHE ALLOWED ME THE FREEDOM
TO BE WHO I AM
AND DIDN'T LET THAT
GET IN THE WAY
OF A FRIENDSHIP.
OH, YOU DECORATE
SO AWESOME.
AREN'T THESE FABULOUS?
THESE ARE AWESOME.
I'M GLAD YOU GOT
TO SAVE SOMETHING.
YOU WANT A DIET COKE?
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
RuPaul:
TAMMY HASN'T SEEN JIM J.
SINCE HE LOST HIS
LOVER TO AIDS
AND WAS HIMSELF
DIAGNOSED WITH HIV.
HOW ARE YOU DOING
WITHOUT JOHN?
ARE YOU DOING OK?
IT'S BEEN A LONG,
HARD ROAD, YOU KNOW, BUT--
I KNOW.
IT MUST BE VERY LONELY.
- I'M COMING AROUND.
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.
- GOOD.
I'M A SURVIVOR LIKE YOU.
I LOVED JOHN. YOU KNOW,
I LOVED HIM SO MUCH.
I DON'T LABEL PEOPLE.
I REFUSE TO LABEL PEOPLE.
WE'RE ALL JUST PEOPLE
MADE OUT OF THE SAME OLD DIRT.
AND GOD DIDN'T MAKE
ANY JUNK.
RuPaul: BUT IN SPITE OF THEIR
ON-SCREEN CHEMISTRY,
THE SHOW WAS CANCELED.
AND BEFORE SHE COULD
RECOVER FROM THIS BLOW,
SHE WAS DEALT ANOTHER.
Tammy: I HAD BEEN
BLEEDING FOR A YEAR.
THE BLEEDING BECAME
MUCH WORSE.
AND SO MY GYNECOLOGIST SAID,
"TAMMY, I THINK YOU NEED
TO GO SEE A PROCTOLOGIST."
AND BY THAT TIME, OF COURSE,
IT WAS TOO LATE
AND THE CANCER HAD ALREADY
TAKEN PLACE IN MY BODY.
BEING WITH HER...
DURING...
UM, HER CANCER...
IN THE HOSPITAL,
SLEEPING ON THE BED
NEXT TO HER,
IN THE HOSPITAL...
THAT WAS...
I THINK THE CLOSEST--
CLOSEST...
I'VE EVER BEEN
TO MY MOTHER.
AND I WOULDN'T
TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING.
AND IT WAS WORTH
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD
TO GO THROUGH CANCER
TO GET CLOSE TO MY
PRECIOUS DAUGHTER
AND TO BECOME HER FRIEND,
NOT JUST HER MOM.
RuPaul: BOUNCING BACK
ONE MORE TIME,
TAMMY MADE A DRAMATIC
RECOVERY.
John J.: THE ONE THING
YOU CAN SAY ABOUT TAMMY IS
SHE IS A SURVIVOR.
I MEAN, AFTER THE HOLOCAUST,
THERE WILL BE, LIKE,
ROACHES, TAMMY FAYE AND CHER.
RuPaul: INSPIRED
BY HER SUCCESSFUL
BATTLE WITH CANCER,
TAMMY RECORDED A SELF-HELP
VIDEOTAPE GUIDE
TO SURVIVING LIFE.
IF LIFE HANDS YOU A LEMON...
START MAKING LEMONADE.
BUT BEFORE THE TAPE
COULD BE RELEASED,
THE COMPANY WENT BANKRUPT.
THEN LIFE HANDED TAMMY
YET ANOTHER LEMON.
IN 1996, HER HUSBAND ROE
WAS SENTENCED
TO 2 YEARS IN PRISON
FOR BANKRUPTCY FRAUD.
WE'RE GOING TO A PLACE
CALLED BORON.
BORON IS ACTUALLY WHERE
THEY USED TO MAKE BORAX.
IT'S ABOUT 2 HOURS
AND 15 MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE,
GOING 75, 80 MILES AN HOUR.
WHOO! HA HA HA!
I LIKE TO GO FAST ENOUGH
AND SO YOU LOSE YOUR TUMMY
ON THESE BUMPS.
IF I HADN'T MARRIED TAMMY,
I WOULDN'T BE IN JAIL.
THAT'S TRUE.
THERE WAS MORE SAID
IN MY TRIAL ABOUT MR. BAKKER
THAN THERE WAS ABOUT ME.
YOU KNOW, ANYONE
CAN BE PUT IN PRISON.
IF THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES
THAT THEY DON'T LIKE YOU,
THEY CAN COME UP
WITH ANY REASON
TO PUT YOU IN PRISON
AND YOU CAN'T STOP IT.
Roe:
TAMMY HAS GONE THROUGH
A LOT OF HEARTACHE
IN HER LIFETIME.
AND PRISON IS HARDER
ON THE WIFE THAN IT IS
ON THE PRISONER.
I USED TO TELL MY MOTHER
MANY TIMES, "BUT, MOM,
THAT'S NOT FAIR,
THAT'S NOT FAIR,"
AND MY MOTHER TRAINED ME
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL
AND SHE SAID, "TAMMY, WHO
EVER SAID LIFE WAS FAIR?"
Roe: I PERSONALLY
DON'T LIKE VISITS,
BECAUSE VISITS
FOR ME ARE HARD.
IT'S HARD TO SAY
GOOD-BYE.
SO I'D RATHER NOT
HAVE A VISIT.
RuPaul: INSTEAD OF LANGUISHING
IN THE DESERT,
TAMMY DECIDED TO GET BACK
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS,
STARTING WITH AN APPEARANCE
ON THE ROSEANNE SHOW.
I WOULD MUCH RATHER PREFER
TO WORK IN SECULAR TELEVISION.
I THINK CHRISTIAN TELEVISION
IS VERY LIMITED IN WHAT
YOU CAN DO.
Man: SO I WANT TO DO
A QUICK RUN-THROUGH
ON THIS,
JUST SO YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE.
I'M COMFORTABLE.
YOU ARE?
TODAY ON THE ROSEANNE SHOW,
INFAMOUS TELEVANGELIST
TAMMY FAYE, OUTSPOKEN
ACTIVIST CHASTITY BONO,
AND ONE OF THE HOTTEST BANDS
AROUND--BLUES TRAVELERS--
IS HERE.
AND NOW HERE'S ROSEANNE!
THAT'S GREAT.
IT'S GOING TO BE
PANDEMONIUM OUT THERE,
BUT...
OK.
YOU'LL RESPOND TO THAT.
I'LL RESPOND TO THAT.
OK.
I THINK WHAT
THE SECULAR WORLD
DOES NOT REALIZE
IS THAT I AM
A VERY SECULAR PERSON.
UH, CHRIST IS JUST
A PART OF ME. UH...
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY
TALK ABOUT.
IT'S SOMETHING INSIDE ME,
AND IT JUST MAKES ME
WHO I AM.
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
Tammy:
TODAY ON THE ROSEANNE SHOW,
TELEVANGELIST TAMMY FAYE,
OUTSPOKEN ACTIVIST
CHASTITY BONO,
AND ONE OF THE HOTTEST
BANDS AROUND--
BLUES TRAVELERS--IS HERE.
AND NOW HERE'S ROSEANNE!
NOW, YOU'RE MAKEUP
IS EXTREME.
YOU THINK IT IS?
IT'S VERY EXTREME.
I DON'T MEAN
TO DISRESPECT YOU.
I JUST WANT
TO KNOW YOU.
I THINK I FEEL UGLY
WITHOUT IT.
WELL, IF YOU THINK
YOU LOOK UGLY WITHOUT IT--
I DO.
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING--
THAT'S NOT A RIGHT WAY
TO THINK.
I KNOW, ROSEANNE.
BUT, OK, SO DON'T.
BUT THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL,
YOU KNOW.
BUT THAT'S
THE WRONG WAY TO FEEL.
HI, GREG.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU'RE TALLER THAN I THOUGHT.
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE SHORTER
THAN I THOUGHT.
RuPaul: DECIDING IT WAS
TIME FOR NEW HEADSHOTS,
TAMMY TURNED TO PHOTOGRAPHER
GREG GORMAN.
HERE.
WHAT I THOUGHT
WE COULD DO
IS START, MAYBE,
SINCE YOU'RE
PROBABLY
NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH
MYSELF AS I AM WITH
YOU,
IS SIT DOWN, LET ME
SHOW YOU SOME OF
MY WORK,
AND LET'S TALK
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO TRY TO DO.
SOUNDS GOOD.
OH, YES!
MY FAVORITE LADY
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
SARAH, THE DUCHESS OF YORK.
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
HOW WE'VE KIND OF
TAKEN HER OUT OF
THE REALM OF HOW
PEOPLE HAD SEEN HER
AND GIVEN HER
KIND OF A NEW LOOK.
MM-HMM.
WHAT WE DID IS BASICALLY...
MADE HER SOFT,
SOFTENED HER.
SOFTEN, SOFTENED HER.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
SO YOU'VE NEVER DONE PICTURES
WITHOUT THOSE EYELASHES?
NO, AND I NEVER WILL
BECAUSE THAT'S
MY TRADEMARK.
RIGHT.
AND IF I TAKE
MY TRADEMARK AWAY,
THEN IT'S NOT ME.
AND SO I HOLD
ONTO THAT, I THINK--
EVEN IF WE SOFTEN THEM
AND KEPT THEM--
NO, NO. THEY STAY
JUST WHERE THEY ARE.
OK.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING ELSE,
BUT MY EYELASHES WILL
STAY WHERE THEY ARE.
YOU GOT IT.

OK. SO I'M GOING TO START
BY TAKING SOME OFF.
OK.
I'M GOING TO TAKE
YOUR FOUNDATION OFF.
OK.

YOU WANT A LITTLE REMOVER?
THAT'S IT.

I DIDN'T KNOW.

I WOULD FEEL BETTER
IF WE DO A BEFORE

AND NOT DO SO MUCH
OF THIS, PLEASE.
I THINK WE'RE
GONNA START WITH
MAYBE THIS LONG
LEATHER JACKET, CK.
KIND OF TOUGH
BUT FITTED,
AND GIVE A SEXY LOOK,
BUT IT'S A POWER LOOK,
ALSO--
"I'M IN CHARGE."
NO. I DON'T
FEEL GOOD IN THIS.
THIS IS NOT ME.
UH-UH.
FEEL TOO...
I'M TOO--IT'S JUST
NOT ME AT ALL.
OK.
SHE BROUGHT A FEW THINGS
OF HER OWN
THAT WE MIGHT NOT
GET TO TODAY.
I GET SO SICK OF THIS

THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
I LIKE REAL.
I AGREE.
I'M AN OLD FARM GIRL

RuPaul: THE NEXT DAY
TAMMY WENT TO USA NETWORKS
TO PITCH HER IDEAS
FOR TV SHOWS
TO NETWORK EXECUTIVE
STEVEN CHOW,
CREATOR OF COPS AND STUDS.
HELLO.
WELL, HI, STEVEN!
HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M TAMMY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HI. HAVE A SEAT.
OK. THANK YOU.
SO YOU HERE
TO PITCH SOMETHING.
WELL, YOU'RE HERE TO PITCH,
SO START, RIGHT?
OK. WELL, NO, I--
I'VE GOT 3 IDEAS, STEVEN,
AND THEN I WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT YOU
SEE ME AS DOING.
BUT ONE OF MY IDEAS
IS A CHILDREN'S SHOW,
WHERE WE TALK TO PUPPETS
AND WE TALK TO THE KIDS,
AND THEN KIDS
TALKING TO PUPPETS
ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS
AND THEIR CONCERNS
AND THINGS WHICH BOTHER THEM.
IT WOULD BE A FUN SHOW
WITH SOME SERIOUS PARTS
ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU KNOW.
IT'S A WAY TO GO.
I'M NOT SURE IT'S--
BUT WHAT ABOUT PUPPETS AND...
EVERYBODY LOVES PUPPETS.
EVEN ADULTS...
SURE.
LOVE PUPPETS.
UH-HUH.
I HAVE ANOTHER ONE.
TEENAGERS NEED SOMETHING
REALLY SPECIAL.
THEY NEED A FORMAT
FOR A LOT OF THINGS.
AND THEY HAVE NO WAY--
THE BIGGEST THING
THEY ALWAYS SAY,
"WELL, HOW DO WE GET
ANYONE TO LISTEN TO US?"
AND I WOULD JUST LOVE
TO GIVE THEM THAT CHANCE.
AND GO WHERE THEY GO.
I WOULD LIKE TO GO
TO THE PIERCING PARLORS
WITH THEM.
I'D LIKE TO GO TO
THE TATTOO PLACES WITH THEM.
JUST DO EVERYTHING
THAT TEENAGERS DO.
AND--AND YOU WOULD
CALL THIS SHOW WHAT?
TAMMY'S TERRIFIC TEENS
WOULD BE A FUN TITLE.
AND, UM...
ALL RIGHT.
NO, I'M JUST CURIOUS.
YEAH, YEAH, WE'D
PROBABLY HAVE TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING FUN.
AND THEN I'VE GOT ONE MORE.
HA HA HA.
OK. NO, NO, NO. I MEAN,
WE'LL CIRCLE BACK.
OK. MEDICINE TODAY
WITH TAMMY FAYE.
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT IS AVAILABLE, YOU KNOW,
IN THE MARKET THAT'S
COMING UP NEW
AND WHAT IS AVAILABLE--
THE OLD THINGS THAT WORK
IN MEDICINE.
UM...
I MEAN, I'D LIKE TO GO
SIT WITH ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS
AND EXPLAIN ALL--
HAVE THE DOCTORS
EXPLAIN ALZHEIMER'S.
AY YI YI.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M JUST THROWING THESE OUT.

YOU'RE THE--
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE THE...
I MEAN, I DON'T...

I MEAN, I THINK--
I SUSPECT, AND I'M
MAKING A STATEMENT
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT
BE TRUE,
BUT I THINK THAT
YOU WANT TO BE
ON THE AIR.
YOU REALLY LIKE BEING
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA.
WELL, I LOVE THE CAM--
I DO LOVE THE CAMERA.
BECAUSE I THINK--
WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S A PERSON.
I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT
I UNDERSTAND THE APPEAL.
BECAUSE IT'S PEOPLE.
IT'S NOT A CAMERA.
IT'S PEOPLE.
IT'S SOMEONE TO TALK TO.
I--I DON'T KNOW,
YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
I CAN'T HELP--
I CAN'T--I MEAN,
I HAVE NO PLACE
FOR A TALK SHOW.
I UNDERSTAND THAT, STEVEN.
I SHOULD WALK YOU
DOWNSTAIRS TO LIFETIME
WHICH ABOUT 15 FLOORS
BELOW US RIGHT NOW.
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
PUT MY NAME IN AT LIFETIME,
SEE MAYBE SOMEONE
WOULD BE INTERESTED THERE.
I WOULD REALLY
APPRECIATE THAT, STEVEN.

IS DAWN THERE?
IT'S STEVEN CHOW.
RuPaul: THE CALL TO LIFETIME
WENT UNRETURNED, AND TAMMY
FOUND OTHER NETWORKS
UNWILLING TO MEET
AND DISCUSS HER
TELEVISION COMEBACK.
SO SHE RETURNED
TO THE DESERT...
Tammy: COME ON, MUFFIN.

"OH, I COULDN'T
COME TO CHURCH
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
DIVORCED."
WHEN WE DO KIND

WHAT GOD HAS TO SAY IS
COME BACK.
Tammy: GOING BACK TO CHURCH
WAS VERY FRIGHTENING FOR ME.
BUT AS I WALKED
IN OUR CHURCH,
PASTOR JEFF CAME AND PUT THOSE
GREAT BIG OL' ARMS
AROUND ME,
AND HE SAID, "TAMMY FAYE,
WE WANT YOU HERE."

AND IT'S THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE
THAT YOU WILL EVER FIND

RuPaul: FINALLY TAMMY
HAD THE CONFIDENCE
TO SING AGAIN.
SHE ACCEPTED AN INVITATION
TO SING AT ORAL ROBERTS

Tammy: I DREADED GOING BACK
BECAUSE THE CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITY HAD BEEN
SO UNKIND TO US,
AND I FELT WE HAD
BEEN JUDGED SO UNFAIRLY

TO MAKE THE TRIP, TAMMY
ALSO HAD TO OVERCOME

WAS TAMMY FAYE,

Hello?
Hi, honey. It's me.
I went to see the doctor today,
'Cause ever since you've been gone,
I had a pain deep down inside.
He says there's nothing really wrong with me.
I'm just missin' my man.
So, honey, please... come on home as soon as you can.

I heard you have a much better chance
Of getting in if you come by cab.
You're really worried about getting in?
Yes.
I thought you'd been here several times before.
Not the front way.
They were private parties.
We came in the back.
We look really good tonight.
I'm sure we're going to get in.
Get back.
Let's get a cab.
Maybe you're right.
When we get out, don't stop where the crowd is.
Just follow me right in.
When we get out, we just follow you in.
Yeah.
Why don't you put this on?
What?
Just until we get inside.
I don't get it.
We're all together.
Van!
Only him.
We're together. Come on, van.
This is important.
These are my friends.
You can go in, but they'll have to wait.
Hey, nice coat.
Don't worry, Jimmy. We don't care.
I can't believe it.
Yeah, what an asshole.
You know, that had nothing to do
With you guys.
Van just wanted to put me in my place.
Apparently, it happens all the time.
Jerk.
It's happened to you before?
No, but it was overdue.
You know, none of us really wanted to go anyway.
Yeah, we're exhausted.
No, I really wanted to go.
There's Jimmy Steinway.
I can't believe it...
He's already leaving?
You like him?
I could never be interested in anyone
Who worked in advertising.
God. You were right.
This place has gotten really hard to get into.
Who's the other guy you were interested in?

This is the last time I'm coming here.

Of course we got in.
Who was the second guy you were interested in?
Tom Platt.
Oh, well, that's a lot better.
How do you mean?
Well, Tom Platt's smart and somewhat cool,
A lawyer involved in environmental causes...
Not to mention tall, dark, and handsome.

Hey, Mcgrath!
Come back here!
It's not what you think.
I'm...
I think I'm gay.
What?
That's not possible.
How?
It's always been there, I guess.
I've only begun to acknowledge it now.
You really think you're gay?
Taxi.
I was just starting law school
When the first up-Tempo
Philadelphia international hits broke:
Some people don't consider that disco...
Because it's good...
But I remember feeling absolutely electrified.
You feel electrified often.
No, but this was different.
I loved the idea that there'd be
All these great places for people to go dancing,
After the terrible social wasteland
Of our college years. Uhff.
You've been to a lot of discos?
No. In fact, practically none.
For me, law school wasn't easy,
And I haven't had much of a social life
Since coming to the city, either.
But I still consider myself a loyal adherent
To the disco movement.
It's a "movement"?
Sort of.
What I found terribly encouraging
Was the idea that when the time in life came
To have a social life,
There'd be all these great places
For people to go to,
Because, as you'll remember,
For many years, there were none.
Yeah.
What I didn't realize... is that it gets so impossible to get into.
Let's call it a night.
No, wait. I have an idea.
Jimmy.
Here take this. Jimmy!
Take this. Jimmy!
Oh, hi.
Hi.
You're des's friend.
Yeah, hi.
Where are Marshall and Steve?
They've gone back to the hotel.
Jim, come on.
I can't believe it.
Jim, let's go.
They wanted me to apologize for them.
They were really bushed.
What a disaster.
No.
I can't believe it.
Wow!

Do you like nightmares?
No.
Well, I do.
It's not obviously connected, but...
I think that's what made me a little more tolerant
Of the guys at Hampshire.
What do you mean?
You were a bit critical.
The guys there preferred women more..."laid-Back."
I'm laid-Back.
For whatever reason,
You didn't have much of a social life there.
I had a social life...
Just not one of those terrible pretend-Marriages.
The Hampshire guys were jerks,
Hippy-Dippy suburbanites with all this hair...
And extremely dim intellectual interests.
I'm sorry, I don't consider the guy who did
The Spiderman comics a serious writer.
Alice, one thing I've noticed
Is that people hate being criticized.
Everyone hates that.
It's one of the great truths of human nature.
I think it's why my parents got divorced.
I'm sorry... It's just that you're so terrific...
It makes me sick to think that you might get in
That terrible situation again,
Where everyone hated you...
Hated me?
You're wonderful.
Maybe, in physical terms,
I'm a little cuter than you,
But you should be much more popular than I am... it would be such a shame
If what happened in college repeated itself.
Why would it repeat itself?
You're right.
I just think it's so important
To be in control of your own destiny...
Not to fall into that fifties cliche
Of waiting by the phone for guys to call:
The right ones never do.
Those who do,
You have to make the most ridiculous excuses to:
The nice ones get hurt feelings and hate you;
The jerks inevitably corner you
Into going out anyway.
Late at night you find yourself
With some awful guy with disgusting breath,
Thrusting his belly up against you,
Trying to stick his slobbering tongue
In your mouth. Ugh, yecch.
Thank god this is a whole new era in music
And social models!
We're in complete control.
Look down.
There are a lot of choices out there.

Fantastic. This place is better
Than I could have imagined.
It's too bad Steve and
Marshall didn't come...
They really would have loved this.
Don't worry about it. So what.
It's so stupid.
I'm sure it's Jimmy.
I think it's much better to wait
Until things happen naturally.
Forcing things never works.
That's not true.
Forcing things usually works beautifully.
You know, even if he's in advertising,
Someone will want him.
I just think it's so important
That we be in control of our own destinies.
It doesn't matter.
Marshall's a really good guy.
He doesn't really care about this kind of stuff.
I can't believe it.
Uh, excuse me... has anyone ever told you you look just like
Kate Preston's brother rod?
Who?
Rod Preston. Do you know him?
Uh, no.
Have you ever noticed that people who look just alike
Never seem to know each other?
Hunh.
Hi.
Hey. How've you been?
Fine. How are you?
He's really depressed.
God, isn't this place great?
It's fantastic! I love it.
I really like this song.
Yeah.
Do you like to dance?
W- W-Would you?
Sure. Great.
Shall we all go?
I... I think he's too depressed to dance.
Hey, Jimmy, we're going to dance... Come on.
I'm too depressed to dance.
Go ahead.
What's wrong?
Absolute disaster.
What?
I had to get some clients into the club,
So I gave the boss my coat to wear...
"Here, wear this."
It's really stupid.
I can't believe what an idiot I am.
Why? Your coat's nice.
Well, that's just it: It is nice.
But this guy's...
Marshall's...
Clothes are hideous.
It's famous.
But to give him my coat to put over them...
It's so stupid.
It's just really stupid.
It's not stupid.
This club's really hard to get into.
It was unbelievably, incredibly dumb.
He's a really nice guy, and I insulted him.
This nice guy that I stupidly insulted
Is basically my boss.
God, it was really stupid.
Guess you're right.
It was pretty stupid.
Uh, can I get you a drink?
Yeah, thanks.

Well, I didn't let him in.
If van didn't either, he's not in the club.
Did I ever tell you that my first job
Was in advertising... At y&r?
In those days, the big thing was to be nice to everybody...
To the secretaries, to the "media department,"
To the art director, to the client...
Well, I don't think it's that way now.
I don't care.
I don't want that element in the club.
Jimmy is, like, my best friend.
And you've been a good friend to him, des,
But this Jimmy is not a good friend to you.
He's out of control.
He's an egomaniac.
Uh, Jimmy.
Where were you? What a nightmare?
Listen, I don't know how you got in,
But you'd better go.
What?
This way.
You're asking me to leave?
Van has gone crazy.
He made Bernie promise to fire me
If he found you here.
Bernie hates ad agency people. It's nuts.
I can't believe it!
That's like something out of the nazis!
Come on. I will get you back on the list,
But tonight, it's best if you go.
Could I at least go tell my client

No.
Please.

Who's she?
They call her "tiger lady."
It's actually a cheetah pattern she's wearing.
At some point, she wore a tiger pattern.
It's always something very slinky and sexy.
You consider her sexy?
Ah, yeah.
The banquette.
Where's Jimmy?
I don't know. He went to get drinks.
What would you like?
Uh, vodka-Tonic.
Me, too.
I'll go with you.
Ever since I was 6 years old or so,
I sensed I was somehow... different.
Then, every time you made love to me...
You must have wanted to vomit.
No. No, no.
Oh, you're beautiful!
You don't have to be some sweaty, horny,
Hetero he-Ape to admire and... And appreciate... female beauty... only very, very recently
Did the final realization come.
Exactly when did the final realization come?
2 days ago.
I get up late and usually turn on the TV,
Sort of as a reflex.
Wednesday afternoon,
There was a rerun of wild kingdom,
Mutual of Omaha's nature program with marlin Perkins
And that... attractive, younger guy.
It triggered something.
Suddenly everything fell into place.
I'm gay... and always have been.
You only found out you were gay
On Wednesday?
Only then definitively.
Wednesday was... gay day for me.
Finished eavesdropping?
I wasn't eavesdropping.
Come on. Anything interesting?
Shh. God!
Listen, it's much better you're with Tom than Jimmy.
You two really look great together.
You think so?
It's too bad we weren't closer friends in college.
I think I could really have helped you there.
For most guys,
Sexual repressiveness is a turn-Off.
You're saying this for my benefit?
You're a good conversationalist but... there's something of the kindergarten teacher
About you.
It's really nice, but... the guys you like also tend to be on the ethereal side.
It can get pretty far away
From any kind of physicality.
This is gonna sound dumb, but it really works.
Whenever you can,
Throw the word "sexy" into your conversation.
It's kind of a signal.
Like, um...
"there's something really sexy about strobe lights."
Or, uh...
"this fabric is so sexy."
Yeah, it is.

Josh?
Uh, hi.
What are you doing here?
In New York or in the club?
In the city.
I'm an a.D.A. In Morgenthau's office.
An assistant district attorney for manhattan.
They call us "a.D.A.'S."
You're a prosecutor?
God, how did you get that?
It's not such a big deal...
I'm perfectly competent to do the job, des.
Great. Good.
I wasn't implying anything.
I was just surprised to see you here.
Going to Harvard must have been great.
Well... the people at Hampshire were nice,
And pretty smart, in a nontraditional way,
But I was out of place there.
I'm sorry, I don't consider the guy
Who did the Spiderman comics a serious writer.
Yeah, I thought it was the green hornet
People took more seriously.
Um, excuse me, are you Alice?
Jimmy Steinway gave me this vodka-Tonic to give you,
But I'm afraid I sampled it.
I'll get you another.
Jimmy's gone?
You're "hap"?
Yeah, he wanted me to tell you he's sorry,
But he was ejected from the club.
He was ejected?
Apparently he snuck one of his clients
In the back of the club.
That's odd he knew
I drank vodka-Tonics.
I never told him.
It's uncanny.
You mean, it's a complete cliche?
"All women recent college graduates drink vodka-Tonics,"
Or something like that?
Well, maybe.
So Jimmy think's I'm a total cliche
I ordered a vodka-Tonic, too... So what?
You're plenty original
Without having to order some weirdo drink.
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.
Can I get you another?
Thanks. Actually, if you don't mind,
I think I'd prefer... uh, uh, a whiskey sour.

How did you get involved with environmental causes?
I think that's great.
You're interested in the environment?
Very much so.
Actually, there's one theory
That the environmental movement of our day
Was sparked by the re-Release of bambi
In the late 1950s.
For many members of the baby boom generation,
It was traumatic... the hunters killing bambi's mother.
Yeah, it was terrible.
For 6-Year-Olds, it's devastating.
To this day, no one wants to identify
With those hunters.
I think you're right.
You're living in some women's residence,
Aren't you?
Yeah. It's terrible.
No guests.
Huh.
Wow.
It's really nice.

I live dangerously.

Scrooge Mcduck comics.

I don't know.
You don't know?
I didn't check.
Well, was it light or dark?
Why do you care what time I got in?
Sorry. No reason.
We've got to get an apartment of our own.
Do you know how long it takes
To become an editor?
You mean associate editor.
Yeah. Associate editor.
What's the minimum amount of time
To become an associate editor?
How many years?
That's hard to say.
Approximately.
Maybe 4 years.
But more than years,
Before you can become an associate editor,
You have to have a best seller.
How can you be sure you'll get a best seller?
You cannot.
But what if you don't find one?
You have to.
Show them the outline.
You might want to see this.
It's the Scott Meredith best seller outline.
"Create sympathetic characters,
"With whom readers identify.
Give them problems, make these problems big."
Could I photocopy this?
Yes, but I need it back.
I'd like a copy, too.
That stuff is such crap.
This does describe a lot of best sellers.
That's true.
It's completely formulaic.
Of course it's formulaic. It's a formula.
That's why I prefer nonfiction.
It's good you want to be an editor so much.
In this era of television,
You are devoted to the printed word.
Actually, ultimately,
I'd like to work in television.
But right now, what I need's a raise.
Alice and I have been looking at apartments,
But we can't afford one on what we get as assistants.
That's so comical.
What?
That giris like you really worry about paying rent.
Aren't your fathers heavily subsidizing
Your living expenses with big allowances?
They're not big at all.
In a few years, you'll marry
Some incredibly rich corporate lawyers.
It's not as if you really worry about paying the rent
Like the rest of us.
Oh, you worry about paying the rent?
Yeah.
Then you're way ahead of us
'Cause we don't even have an apartment.
What if, in a few years,
We don't marry some corporate lawyer?
What if we marry some meatball like you?
But not you personally,
But someone with similarly low socioeconomic prospects?
Can you believe that?
They really think that way.
Disco sucks.
What a dope.
Would you ever go out
With anyone who worked in the company?
Fortunately,
There's absolutely no temptation.
Charlotte, telephone.
It's a man.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
We were thinking of having some people for dinner
Saturday night.
Wanted to know if you could come.
About 7:30.
Ok. Where?
Actually, I'll have to call you back with that.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Ok.
Bye.
That was Jimmy Steinway.
He's coming for dinner Saturday night.
You called him?
I thought you said you could never be interested
In anyone who worked in advertising.
No one could say something like that seriously.
It was obviously a joke.
Anyway, it's not like it's a date or anything.
He's invited as part of a group.
It's really important
There be more group social life,
Not just all this ferocious pairing off.
You like Tom.
Invite him.
We don't even have an apartment.
How can we have a dinner party?
Well, it's another incentive to get one.
Does the Lexington avenue express stop at 86th street?
I think so.
We'd better hurry.
Do you really think we know each other well enough
To room together?
Well, maybe that's good.
It's not just that we don't know each other well.
I'm not even sure we really like each other.
That's ok.
You know, Alice,
I'm not so much of a bitch as I might seem.
You'll find holly's a little sensitive
About her intelligence.
She's dumb?
Harvard guys, even the ones that
Seem reasonably cool on the outside,
Are all essentially wimps and bookworms
On the inside.
They love being seen out with this lovely girl,
But after a date or two,
Rather than risk rejection,
They pretend to drop her,
Going around complaining about how dull she was.
Is she dull?
A little, but that's not the point.
Once you start worrying about something like that,
You're lost.
Holly was devastated.
She stopped dating entirely,
And weekends either went home
Or just hung around the library at pine manor.
What do you think you're doing?
Shove off, Mack!
Deviant!
Creep! Off!
So I wouldn't develop any illusions
About Harvard guys.
They can be amazing creeps, too.
Ah, there you are.
Hi.
Our friend still isn't here.
Sorry. I forgot which way the numbers went
On the east side.
It's what's called a railroad apartment.
It's long and rather narrow like a railroad car.
Each room opens directly onto the other.
It's very nice.
The closets are here.
This is the other bedroom.
The bathroom is back here at this end.
And the kitchen.
So to get to the bathroom from the living room,
You have to clomp through both bedrooms?
Well, there are 2 outside doors,
So in theory,
You can use the exterior hall
To go between the kitchen and the living room.
Huh.
Even with 2 roommates, the layout is a bit awkward.
You can't afford something bigger?
We all work in book publishing.
Couldn't your parents help?
They already are.
So what do you think?
I think it's really nice.
Isn't the layout a bit awkward?
Well, I think we should take it.
Here you go.
It's good to see bourgeois giris
Building up a sweat.
Why is that good to see?
You live around here?
There was a guild meeting at asphalt green.
A guild meeting?
The newspaper guild is organizing clerical
And editorial staff for book publishing.
I'm supposed to organize our department.
Oh, my god. We're all gonna lose our jobs.
You should support this.
You were just complaining how lousy the pay is.
Are you rooming with them?
That's gonna be really tough.
Aren't we behind schedule?
Nope. This recipe's extremely fast.
Hello.
Uh, it's Dan.
Dan?
Hi. Come up.
Dan from your department.
I invited him.
Departmental Dan?
You know... he went to Harvard.
So?
Yeah, I've got to meet some clients at 10:00
And get them into the club.
Tom isn't coming?
If he does, he'll be very late.
Isn't this what they call a railroad apartment?
Uh-Huh.
People always say how terrible they are,
But it seems pretty nice.
Well, the layout's not so good.
It's amazing the little things in life
One doesn't appreciate until they're missing,
Such as hallways.
These apartments were actually planned
In the last century as tenement housing
For working class families.
Now all the yuppie roommate combos
Are crowding them out.
Well... that's just tough.
Fight!
Rumble!
Actually, I was thinking I'd go home.
What?
You should come.
I don't know.
I'm not really a disco type.
Well, who is?
I probably wouldn't get in anyway.
Of course you'll get in. Holly's gorgeous.

Thanks, Jimmy.
Have fun, jack, harry.
Thanks a lot, des. I really appreciate it.
Fine, cool.
I'm starting to realize how important eye contact is.
I can't talk to people in this thing.
They get nervous. They don't know who I am.
Well, that's the point.
You think tonight would be a good time
To talk to van?
Try to patch things up, get a reprieve of some sort?
Uh, no.
My job's sort of on the line, des.
And not all clients will be such good sports
As harry and jack.
If it's a question of groveling,
I can do that.
Just point me in the right direction.
Shh! God!
Can I show you something?
Sure. What?
You know something about banking, don't you?
Yeah. Manny hanny used to be a client.
Manufacturers hanover.
I know what manny hanny is.
Note... no lock.
10 is the cover charge.
God. Paying a cover charge to get into a club?
How humiliating.
That's your reaction?
Look at this.
Kind of worrisome, don't you think?
Yeah.
To me, shipping cash to Switzerland
In canvas bags
Doesn't sound honest.
To me, it suggests possible illegality.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Well, I'm not going into that room anymore.
Uh, gimlet, please?
Domestic beer or bud?
Um... whiskey sour?
Excuse me.
You're Alice Kinnon, aren't you?
Yeah.
We met at that party in sag harbor,
Labor day weekend.
You were just coming in as I was leaving,
And you asked me where the kitchen was.
Do you remember?
I do remember getting to the kitchen.
Uh, excuse us.
We're here sort of as a group.
If you don't mind?
Excuse me.
Why did you say that?
I didn't like the look of him at all.
Didn't you notice how he was eyeballing you?
Creepy.
Frankly, I thought he might've been the guy
That bothered me on the subway.
I'm sorry if I overreacted.
Poor guy.
It's no big deal.
That kind of thing happens all the time.
Anyway, you've got Tom.

Do you remember the conversation we had
Labor day weekend?
Had a huge impact on me.
Really?
Jennifer and I had been talking all year
About either acknowledging
The permanence of our relationship and marrying
Or finally just breaking up.
I had no idea you were even dating anyone.
I thought you knew.
No. We've been together since college.
But the weekend after labor day,
We had this long talk.
Jennifer proposed a trial separation,
Which normally I'd have considered ridiculous,
But I couldn't help thinking of you
And went along.
Out of some sort of
Residual loyalty to Jennifer,
I didn't call you immediately
And instead started coming to the club.
I'm not a very good dancer, but...
No, you are.
I was also curious if the sexual revolution
Went as far as everyone said it had.
But emotionally, I couldn't handle it.
I got so depressed, and... when I saw you that night,
You were... a vision,
Not just of loveliness, but of... virtue... and sanity.
What?
I shouldn't talk about it.
I'll just end up sounding like an idiot.
No, what?
You're very sexy
And good-Looking and modern and hot.
But what I was craving
Was a sort of sentient individual
Who wouldn't abandon her intelligence
To hop into bed with every guy she meets
In a nightclub.
Why... why is it that when people have
Sex-With-Strangers on their mind,
Their I.Q. Just drops, like, 40 points?
All that affected
Sexy seductress slinking around?
And uncle scrooge is sexy?
I mean, my god, is there no limit?
No. That was to...
Do you think I'm an idiot?
I'm so sick of all the lies and nonsense!
Alice?
Alice, what's wrong?
What happened?
Mcgrath! Where is he?
I'd say it's definitely not a good idea
To approach van tonight.
There he is.
Mcgrath!
Drew Mcgrath.
You're out of here right now.
What?
Bernie. Bernie!
Where is he? Here he is.
Bernie, this guy's through.
What's going on?
We had a public safety situation in the front.
This jerk comes out, trying to make it worse.
Is this true?
Public safety situation?
Give me a break.
It was a joke. I'm sorry.
We had a public safety situation.
The cops came. It was no joke.
I tease him a tiny bit.
No teasing, des.
No teasing?
Either he goes or I do.
Come on, van. Des, grow up.
Cut it out.
Ok. Sorry.
It's the ad guy.
So, it's the dancing ad man.
You're finished.
Ok, I work in advertising.
Is that a crime?
What's happening in this country?
There they are! Get 'em!
Get the tin man. Get him.
Get this jerk out of the club.
You're fired, des. You're out of here.
You can't fire me, van.
Only Bernie can fire me.
Ok.
You're fired.
And take this yuppie scum with you.
Good riddance!
Yuppie scum?
In college, before dropping out,
I took a course in the propaganda uses of language.
One objective is to deny other people's humanity
Or even right to exist.
In the men's lounge,
Someone scrawled "kill yuppie scum."
Do yuppies even exist?
No one says, "I am a yuppie."
It's always the other guy who's a yuppie.
I think for a group to exist,
Somebody has to admit to be part of it.
Of course yuppies exist.
Most people would say you two are prime specimens.
We're not yuppies!
You think we're yuppies?
You're seriously saying you're not yuppies?
No.
Yuppie stands for "young upwardly mobile professional."
Nightclub flunky is not a professional category.
Contrary to popular belief,
Junior-Level ad jobs don't pay well at all.
I wish we were yuppies:
Young, upwardly mobile, professional.
Those are good things, not bad things.
Where we going?
Rex's. Oh, no.
What's wrong with rex's?
Well, you can't dance there,
And it's full of boring preppies.
Oh, and we're so interesting.
You can dance at rex's.
Yeah, but why rex's?
Why not some other place?
Well, for one thing,
Everyone at the club knows that I go there,
So when they come looking for me,
I wanna be there.
Why would they come looking for you?
What happened tonight was a mistake,
Which even now Bernie's probably very much regretting.
He's a smart guy.
Not without good qualities... even if very few.
I wouldn't be very surprised if he's already called rex's
To retract my dismissal.
How can you be so sure of that?
Well, I'm not sure of it.

Hey. Hey, rex.
Welcome to rex's.
Alice, you look like you've seen
The dark side of the moon.
What did Tom say?
No. I feel much better.
I love your idea of social life as a group,
Without all this ferocious pairing off.
I couldn't have stood being alone tonight.
I thought Bernie was smarter than that.
What a blunder.
When they do call, we'll get you immediately.
Thanks, rex.
Rex is such a great guy.
Yeah. Charlotte says she can tell if a guy's gay or not
Just by looking in his eyes.
How?
Maybe it's related to how they look at you.
It's hard to define,
But I think women can tell.
I can't.
Are Jimmy or I gay?
Come on, don't.
Jimmy?
No.
Well, not your eyes,
But you do have a gay mouth.
A gay mouth?
I have a gay mouth?
What does that mean?
Just what I said.
It's true, des. Your mouth does look gay.
God! How moronic can you get?
What nonsense!
Don't think I don't know your whole act.
Excuse me?
Pretending to be gay
To get sympathy from women
While cruelly dumping them,
And to seem cooler than you actually are.
I despise your whole pathetic act.
You're not fit to lick the boots
Of my real gay friends.
Well, I don't want to lick the boots
Of your real gay friends.
You know, I could be gay.
I see through you completely.
Oh, you see through me completely.
Yeah, I do.
That's the dark side of feminism.
What?
You have a kind of free pass to make any kind of wounding
Or derogatory comment you want.
I am hardly a militant feminist.
No, you're not.
A militant feminist would be a lot fairer.
It's women like you whose attitudes to men
Are so dehumanizing.
Like what?
That men are swine,
Obsessed with large breasts
And the sex act,
Devoid of any idealistic or romantic sensibility
When in fact,
We have that idealistic sensibility
In spades.
For instance, you have no idea
What men really think about women's breasts.
What do men think about women's breasts?
Well, it's not something you just blurt out.
It's far more complicated and nuanced than that.
Ok, I'll tell you a story.
When I was in college,
There was a girl I had a crush on
Who always had older boyfriends,
Invariably some senior.
Finally, they all graduated,
And one night we went back to her room alone.
Suddenly, her shirt was off,
And I was confronted with these breasts,
Which turned out to be completely surprising
And frankly, disconcerting.
They were rather large and not ugly
Or especially strange-Shaped,
But in all the time that
I had thought about her,
These breasts had never figured.
She took off her shirt so quickly,
There was no time for adjustment,
And I said something arrogant about it,
As if her abrupt unveiling of her largish breasts
Was somehow going to slay my swinish male self,
As if I hadn't already been slayed
On a much higher level.
Her name was Alice, too.
Oh, come on, des.
You know that's not true.
What do you mean, it isn't true?
Her name wasn't Alice.
Well, I'm not gonna use her real name.
Would you like to dance?

If what's bothering you relates to Tom,
I wouldn't take it personally.
Did you know Tom and Jennifer
Had a trial separation,
Which was to end tonight?
What you might not know
Is that about a week ago,
They started seeing each other on the sly,
Cheating on their trial separation.
How do you know that?
Working at the club,
You find out all kinds of things.
You know, this is the way people used to dance in bars
In the old days.
Do people ever really dance in bars?
I thought that was a myth.
People my older brother's age, uh, they did.
Your brother must be a lot older.
Before disco,
This country was a dancing wasteland.
You know the woodstock generation of the 1960s
That were so full of themselves
And conceited?
None of those people could dance.

I think she noticed
That, for a moment, I flinched.
She dropped me like a rock.
I was crushed.
I couldn't take it, so I dropped out
And got in the night club business early,
Thanks to which
I probably owe my success today.
Let's share a cab.
We're thinking of going.
You're all going?
Yeah.
Have they called yet from the club?
I don't think they will call.
Bernie will probably send some emissary.
That's more his style.
What should we do with the oz costumes,
Just, uh, bring 'em by the club tomorrow?
Actually, those costumes are mine.
Just get 'em back to me when you can.
I thought we were here as a group.
You talked about the tremendous importance
Of group social life.
Well, it's really late.
Yeah, Alice, it's getting really late.
We'd better get going.
Hey, thanks again, des.
Ciao.
Bye.
Bye.
All week charlotte's been talking about
The tremendous importance of group social life,
Opposing all this ferocious pairing off.
Well, group social life has its place,
But at a certain point,
Other biological factors come into play.
Our bodies weren't really designed
For group social life.
A certain amount of pairing off
Was always part of the original plan.
God, I can't believe you'd say that.
What?
What did I say?
What you mean to say is that they've all gone back
To screw their brains out?!
No, I didn't say that!
I said they were going to pair off.
Well, wait, don't go!
I didn't mean to say anything
Anyone could be offended by.
Oh, thank god. He's here.
Des, Bernie regrets what happened.
It was a mistake, and he wants you back.
I'm sorry. I know why you're so upset.
I mean,
I know what really happened with Tom.
What?!
That he thought
You were really slutty or something.
That's so stupid!
You can't worry about what misinterpreters think!
That's so unfair!
Come back to my place. We should talk.
Nothing will happen!
I just need somebody to talk to.
Maybe you do, too.

I'm sure it was Jimmy.
It's very quiet.
Get out! Get out!
That was pretty bad.
God!
What's the matter now?
What?
All the noise...
Clomping around, banging pans.
Sorry. I didn't realize it.
You obviously intended it.
What do you mean?
That's very aggressive.
You don't clomp around, banging pans
For no reason.
Like what reason?
You know perfectly well.
Because I only bang pans?

But anything I did that was not wrong,
I don't apologize for.

The memoir by the Dalai lama's older brother?
Oh.
I'd like to bring it up
At Wednesday's editorial meeting.
You really liked that?
Other people liked it, too?
Yeah.
Ok. I'll take another look.
You know, it's considered a little self-Indulgent
To read too much of a manuscript
If it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
Have you known holly long?
Just since we found the apartment. Why?
She's very, uh... quiet, isn't she?

I don't understand that.

I'm asking is...
You do like holly, don't you?
Yeah, of course.
But... she is intelligent, isn't she?

Congratulations, Alice.
Yeah, your first book. Great.
It could be a bestseller.
Charlotte. Oh, charlotte.
That was so moving,
What you said about our obligation to writers.
Thanks.
And how often we fall short of that.
Well, let's face it,
Most authors are still conceited dopes.
Oh, you... You can't say that.
You're an editor.
You don't have to deal with them on a daily basis.
When you're an assistant,
It's harder to dodge their calls.
Good going, Alice.
I'm really glad we got this book.
I understand that you know some people at the club.
Do you think that maybe, um,
Sometime you could, uh, get us in there some night?
Yeah. Certainly. We'll arrange that.
Very good. Thanks.
Thanks a lot, Dan.
Sure.
Do you have any idea why Jimmy's
Suddenly so interested in your social life?
No. He's interested in my social life?
Haven't you noticed?
He's always wondering
Why you don't go out or go to the club.
He is?
You know, Alice,
You've been hanging around the apartment a lot.
You've kind of set up office there.
None of the rest of us has any privacy.
The railroad apartment wasn't my idea.
Yeah, that's true, but it's just odd
That you're so much friendlier to Jimmy
Now he's with me.
I just think the situation's kind of awkward.

I hate asking that guy for favors.
They're not gonna keep me on much longer
If I can't get clients into the club.
It's that important to you
To stay in advertising?
Ok. Better see him while he's still on his upswing.
Hey, des.
Hi.
God, what happened to you?
Jesus. Josh, you're a mess.
I'm a mess.
I got to talk to you.
You sure you don't want to clean up a little?
It's kind of serious.
I'll look for Alice and charlotte,
See if they've come in.
That's Audrey Rouget,
The youngest person ever to be made an editor
In the history of farrar, Straus.
How do you know her?
She interviewed me.
How did it go?
Have you ever been in an interview
And gotten the impression they see through you completely?
I didn't get an offer.
You don't want to clean up a little?
No.
You know, you look really bad.
I know. That's actually good in my work.
It puts people at ease, looking like this.
They feel, frankly, superior to me
And say things they ordinarily wouldn't.
It's very disarming.
Phew! What happened?!
I was having drinks
With some friends in the village,
And there was this terrible guy
Really bothering this girl,
So I decided to intervene,
But it turns out they were married.
What's this now? You're not here
On official business, are you?
Knowing that we went to college together,
They asked me to talk to you.
Who is "they"?
I can't tell you.
I couldn't believe you'd be involved
In the kinds of things
That have been going on here
And told them so.
I consider you a person of some integrity,
Except, you know,
In your relations with women.

Ok, the tortoise won one race.
Do you think the hare is really gonna lose
Any more races to turtles? Not on your life.
I liked that tortoise.
So do I, but if you were a betting person,
Would you say, "that tortoise won against the hare.
In future races I'm backing him"?
No. That race was almost certainly a fluke,
And, afterwards, the tortoise is still a tortoise,
And the hare, a hare.
Domestic beer. A bud.
Mm-Hmm.
Vodka tonic, please.
Um, I'll just have a coca-Cola.
You're not drinking?
Alice is not having a cocktail?
I can't believe it.
Well, I'm not.
What is it?
Do you have strep throat or some flu
You're taking antibiotics for?
Oh, my god! You have the clap, don't you?
You're on antibiotics,
And the doctor told you not to drink
Or something.
That's why you're not drinking.

And a cocktail.

No. I'm sure I'm right.

Alice.
I am so, so sorry.
I should never have said that.
I have some sort of sick compulsion
To say everything that occurs to me.
I just want to let you know,
As soon as I can find a new rooming situation,
I'm moving out. I can't take it anymore.
It's not possible.
You're not serious.
Just let me know when you're ready to go.
Ok.
Please, Alice.
Rooming with you and holly
Has been the most important thing
To happen to me in my life.
You're the first woman friends I've ever had.
The anger you're feeling now
Is actually more justified than you know.
When we were at Hampshire,
I really hated you.
You seemed so moralistic and judgmental.
I had no idea, then, how you really were.
When guys wanted to ask you out,
I'd talk them out of it.
Oh, my god. I can't believe how evil I was.
But I've completely changed.
If you will give me another chance,
I'll be the best friend you've ever had.
If the apartment situation weren't so impossible,
I'd move out now.
I can understand how you'd feel that way.
You're right to.
But things aren't always as they seem.
Bad and inexcusable as what I said back there
Might have been, I think you'll find
It'll actually improve your reputation
With these guys enormously.
You'll be more popular than ever. Watch.
Vd's not all bad.
You'll find there are actually
Positive aspects to it.
What?
Well, you know that "please inform
All previous partners" thing?
It's actually a terrific way
To get back in touch
With guys you might have liked
But have lost contact with.
Just in my own experience,
It's twice led to renewed relationships
With guys that lasted quite a while
And were really... sweet.
I'm not talking about herpes infections,
Which are far more serious
And apparently incurable,
Just standard vd and other conditions
Easily treatable with antibiotics.
God, are you following me or something?
You said you weren't taking anything.
Well, I'm not. It was a gift.
I never buy the stuff,
And anyway, it hardly affects me.
Oh, no.
Actually, what I'm high about
Is the situation with Alice.
This makes her seem much more accessible.
She's not operating on a plane
So far removed from the rest of us.
There's hope for me.
What did josh want to talk to you about?
Is everything ok?
Uh, no... not exactly.
I'm sorry to bug you about this,
But I'd be really grateful
If we could talk with van soon.
The way it's going, if I can't get people in here,
I'm going to lose my job.
Des! You lied to me!
I thought you were a wonderful man,
But it was all lies!
No!
You said you loved me!
And then you said you were gay,
But you're not!
Everyone knew but me!
You completely humiliated me!
I could be gay.
You're saying again you're gay?
Tell me honestly,
Have you had sex with men?!

Between games, as planned,
A huge box containing thousands of disco records
Was blown up.
The rest was unplanned.
Fans stormed out onto the field in the thousands.
Disco records were hurled like frisbees.
Bonfires were set. Bottles where thrown.
The batting cage was torn down and destroyed.
Fistfights broke out.
Manhattan district attorney Robert Morgenthau,
At his press conference,
Congratulated prosecutors on their successful convictions
In the probe of...
...speaking for the first time on his real estate task force's
18 convictions of executives at 6 commercial brokerages,
Promised a vigorous prosecution
Of corporate and white collar crime
In a wide-Ranging series of investigations...
I'll just be a second.
Alice, congratulations on the TV sale.
Thanks.
Hi.
Hi.
How's holly?
Fine.
Is she, um, going out with anyone?
Yeah, this really nice guy who went to Denver university
And works in real estate.
He found her this incredibly cheap apartment.
She no longer lives with you guys?
You hold what happened against me.
Not that you broke up,
Just that you go out with people
Based primarily on looks.
Holly's also very nice.
A lot of people are nice.
You only asked out the fabulously good-Looking one.
You hold that against me.
Well, pretty shallow.
You know, Alice, except for politics,
We've got a lot in common.
We're both pretty serious
And, I think, respect each other's
Bases for judgment.
Occasionally,
I get reactionary thoughts, too.
I'm not reactionary.
Well, aesthetically.
Oh, well, aesthetically.
You mean you think I gave it to you?
How can you be sure?
I'm sure.
Well, you were a lot more active than I was.
You were obviously very experienced.
No.
Oh, come on.
How did you know all that?
Well, I read a lot.
You must've been with some guys.
You weren't a virgin.
I didn't consider myself a virgin,
But... what?
I don't know.
Technically... what?
If I'm making love,
The man... spurts... outside the woman,
Does that count as sexual intercourse?
"Spurts"?
If it squirts outside, without getting in,
Does that count as losing your virginity?
No part of the man got in at any time?
I don't think so.
I think part has to get in... to be considered sexual intercourse.
So then I was a virgin.
Oh... I can't believe that.
The first time you make love, I...
I give you both "g" and an "h" infection.
"H"?
Your move.
I'm beginning to think that maybe
That old system of people getting married
Based on mutual respect and shared aspirations,
And then slowly, over time,
Earning each other's love and admiration,
Worked the best.
Well, we'll never know.
Almost ready.
God, waiting around all night
For the unemployed guy to get around to shaving.
You're so busy you can't shower until midnight?
Excuse me. Unemployed is not who I am.
I'm a fully-Employed person
Who just happens not to have a job right now,
Largely because of some structural problems
In the advertising industry.
I'm sorry. That was really inconsiderate.
Please forgive me.
♪♪ Spin me ♪♪
♪ ♪♪ All around the floor... ♪
Of course, if you talk enthusiastically
About your work in advertising,
You sound like a total cretin.
No. Your enthusiasm
Is actually enormously appealing.
In fact, I used to not think so well
Of people in advertising,
But it's one of the great things
About getting out of college and into the real worid,
How experience changes and improves your views.
During college, I remember seeing couples
With crying babies and thinking "how horrible."
Lately, I've been spending a lot of time
With my niece and nephew.
Saturday, I took my niece, who's 7,
To see the Disney movie,
Lady and the tramp. She loved it,
Was so cute.
I'm beginning to fall in love
With the whole idea of having kids.
I hate that movie.
What?
It's so... tacky,
Not to mention depressing.
This sweet movie about cute cartoon dogs,
You found depressing?
There is something depressing about it.
And it's not really about dogs.
Except for some superficial bow-Wow stuff at the start,
The dogs all represent human types,
Which is where it gets into real trouble.
Lady, the ostensible protagonist,
Is a fluffy blonde cocker spaniel
With absolutely nothing on her brain.
She's great-Looking, but... Let's be honest...
Incredibly insipid.
Tramp, the love interest,
Is a smarmy braggart of the most obnoxious kind:
An oily jailbird out for a piece of tail
Or whatever he can get.
Come on.
No. He's a self-Confessed chicken thief
And all-Around sleazeball.
What's the function of a film of this kind?
Essentially, it's a primer on love and marriage
Directed at very young people,
Imprinting on their little psyches the idea
That smooth-Talking delinquents
Recently escaped from the local pound
Are a good match for nice giris from sheltered homes.
When in 10 years, the icky human version
Of tramp shows up around the house,
Their hormones will be racing,
And no one'll understand why. Films like this
Program women to adore jerks.
God, you're nuts.
The only sympathetic character,
The little scotty who's so loyal and concerned about lady,
Is mocked as old-Fashioned and irrelevant
And shunted off to the side.
Isn't the whole point that tramp changes?
Ok, maybe in the past he stole chickens,
Ran around without a license,
And wasn't always sincere
With members of the opposite sex.
But through his love for lady
And the beneficent influences
Of fatherhood and matrimony, he changes... and becomes a valued member of that,
You know, rather idyllic household.
I don't think people really change that way.
We can change our context, but we can't change ourselves.
What does that mean?
Well, you've changed.
Come on, des.
That's a little different.
I agree with josh.
The scotty is the only admirable character.
It would have been a much better movie
If lady'd ended up with him.
I'm really surprised.
I think tramp really changed.
Maybe he wanted to change, or tried to change,
But there's not a lot of integrity there.
First, he'd be hanging around the house,
Drinking and watching ball games
And maybe knocking lady around a bit,
But pretty soon he'll be back
Down at the town dump chasing tail.
Oh, give me a break.
Are you taking your medication,
'Cause what you're saying is
Completely nuts! God, des... no! I think people should know
That our friend here has a certain condition.
How can Morgenthau shut up! Employ you?
He knows about mass. Mental health
And the loony tunes junior year?
Of course he knows about it.
God!
Jimmy, do you know where Alice is?
No. I don't know where she is.
Uh, excuse me.
Were you at Leo Burnett in Chicago?
Oh, my god, how are you?
Um, do you know betty?
Jimmy Steinway, hi.
Hi.
Are you still with ishmoco?
Yeah. There's a sales conference at the Americana.
I'm actually with the international side now,
Based in Spain.
How's that?
Barcelona's beautiful,
But, in human terms, uh, pretty cold.
How 'bout you?
I was at Mccallum, but just got sacked.
Have you found anything else?
No.
Any leads?
No.
You know, there're a lot of agencies in Spain
Looking for people with experience from here.
There's one in Madrid
Some Burnett people have affiliated with.
I could give 'em a call.
That sounds great.
Michael.
Good times.
I don't identify with tramp at all.
I was just sticking up for him
Because no one else was.
I actually identify
With the loyal scotty dog, too.
I've changed.

You iron your own shirts?
Well, if I'm going to court,
I wear a laundry-Ironed shirt,
But, otherwise, I do it myself.
That's a great moment in life
When you can start
Sending all your shirts out for laundering.
At the agency, after my last promotion,
I briefly had that.
In any case, I doubt I'll be working there much longer.
What?
I'm thinking of quitting.
You can't do that.
Why not? What's it to you?
You assured me if I helped you,
You'd be around to protect des.
Well, the situation's changed.
How's it changed?
I can't say.
You can't say.
Maybe des is more involved than I thought.
Or more involved with someone you know.
That's a conflict, josh.
I still can't believe Alice is really serious about des.
Why not?
She seems smarter than that.
That doesn't matter. There's something
Deeply ingrained in human biology.
Women prefer bad over weak and indecisive
And unemployed.
I don't know about that.
You think they do prefer weak, indecisive,
And unemployed?

I care about ideas.
I care about them a lot.
Did you know that in college,
My senior paper was on Ernest Hemingway?
Thanks, baby.
I'm not a nice person, des.
But some things are important,
Such as loyalty.
Loyalty's not eyewash, not like niceness.
I've been loyal to you, des.
I could've fired you, lots of times,
But never did.
Maybe you're not aware of this, des,
But there's some sort of investigation underway.
I think to myself,
"how could this happen?
"How could they get this information?
"Has some disgruntled employee,
"Former or current, informed on us?
"Is there some sort of spy here?
How could agents even get in?"
I mean, really,
They would stand out in this crowd
And, normally, not get past the door.
Do you know how they got in?
Uh, no. Could van be letting them in?
They're coming in as ad agency clients.
What?
Oh, I can't believe it.
After all I did for that guy.
So, you don't know anything about this investigation?
No! Well, a sort of acquaintance of mine
Who now works in Morgenthau's office approached me,
But I didn't tell him anything.
You didn't tell me about that.
I didn't think it was important.
It only just happened.
When? Tonight. Just now.
Why did you use the past perfect then?
I used the past perfect?
Yeah. "I was approached..."

I haven't told you anything.
There was some leak at the precinct level.
Bernie had an informant, but it's been fixed.
It's not a problem any longer.
It's a problem.
I've never said anything to you.
You have to make that clear to everyone.
That doesn't matter.
What?
When everything comes down,
It's gonna be very rough.
Your whole life will be open for examination,
And it might not look so good.
Cut out the drugs, des.
What?
Don't make such a spectacle of yourself as a drug user.
Don't receive them, don't consume them,
And don't pass them on to others.
What are you talking about?
You could be charged with dealing.
Dealing? Those were gifts!
Well... who's accusing me of this?
This is you, isn't it, josh?
That's a conflict. We both like the same girl.
So, you really want to go to a beef house?

I hear san Sebastian's pretty good.
Oh, look, there's blood.
Ciao.
Ciao. Good night.
Look out.
Oh, god!
Oh, my god!
I didn't know anything about it.
The agency just funneled
Clients they wanted to get into the club through me.
Usually, before I got into the car,
I hadn't even met them.
I just assumed they were clients from out of town.
That the I.R.S. Was our largest client
Didn't occur to me then.
I swear I didn't know anything about it, des,
At first.
You scumbag.
Josh promised me you'd be protected.
Oh, great. What's a little shocking
Is that they'd do something so obvious and clumsy
And move so fast,
No matter how richly I may feel you deserved it.
These were just some creeps
Mad van'd turned them away before.
Van's operating under tremendous pressure.
I'm starting to feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.
Oh, great. That's priceless.
You and van, oh, I love that.
Oh!
Want a snort?
Guess not.
I have a very bad feeling about the club, des.
It's like a meteorite is headed straight for it.
It's gonna destroy everything.
The greatest club the worid has ever seen
Is going to be smashed to smithereens.
Yeah, well, I don't think it'll be a meteorite.
Bye.
Alice and I are having breakfast together.
It's a date. You can't come.
Sorry.
Try to get some sleep.
That's what guys do who want to date you?
They say they have a book idea?
Maybe.
Did he say what the book was?
He said he had some crazy ideas
For a book on the criminal justice system.
Of course. That makes sense.
Crazy ideas are the kind that josh would have.
Be careful of that guy.
I was there when he flipped out.
Really scary.
He got up on a table at a cafeteria off Harvard square
And started weirdly singing this hymn.
Apparently, religious mania is highly typical
Of manic depression entering its manic phase.
Josh is not just your garden-Variety loon.
He is a serious nutcase.
What gets me is that this serious nutcase
Now presumes to judge others.
You really think the neurological effects of coffee
Is similar to that of cocaine?
That's what I read somewhere.
In addition to amazing stories,
There are a lot
Of entertaining prosecutors' anecdotes.
And then there's the whole culture
Of the downtown legal district.
It could be good.
Like everything, it all depends on execution.
This is sort of related.
It's an article I wrote for Harper's
During law school.
Did you really just want to have lunch
To discuss a book proposal?
Um... no.
How serious are you and des?
Is it absolutely, completely,
Irrevocably serious?
Did he tell you the story about
How he was traumatized by a Radcliffe girl
Taking off her shirt,
Suddenly revealing her largish breasts,
Which he never thought about before?
He tells that story all the time
To get sympathy and to justify himself,
As if he were the victim
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity.
That wasn't true?
No, it was true. He was the victim
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity,
But so was everyone else.
Not everyone then went on a rampage
Exploiting the opposite sex.
He thinks his problem is just that he falls in love a lot.
Well, a lot of people fall in love a lot.
I'm really surprised you'd be taken in by him.
You should notice I didn't answer your original question.
My original question,
Whether you were absolutely committed to des,
You didn't answer?
What does "loon" mean?
Des calls me that.
I sort of like it.
It's, uh, short for "lunatic"
And also the lake bird with the eerie call.
It's the other terms des uses for me...
"Nutcase,"
"freakazoid," etcetera...
I kind of mind.
A lot of people like to say
They won't take "no" for an answer.
I just wanted you to know
I'm not one of them.
I can be easily discouraged.
I will take "no" for an answer.
Ok.
No.
You don't mean that.
No.
I'm sorry.
She's not in right now.
Ok. I'll have her call you back. Thank you.
Alice, sorry.
What?
You better see bob.
Bob wants to see you right away.
It's something bad?
The author of your
Tibet book doesn't exist.
He's a fraud.
Carol thinks it could be worse
Than the Clifford Irving case.
Carol thinks it's as bad as the Clifford Irving case.
Turns out the author isn't the Dalai lama's brother,
But a Los Ángeles writer named John Disimio.
It's a shame. This is a really good book.
Dan thinks it's one of the best things
Ever written on Tibetan Buddhism.
What a mess.
I'm sorry I haven't been more of a help.
I've been a little preoccupied myself.
I'm late for my period.
How late?
A day.
A day late, and you're worried?
I'm sure I'm pregnant.
But isn't that what you wanted?
What do you mean?
Well, I thought you said
You wanted to have
Jimmy Steinway's babies.
Yeah, but not this way.
I'm not an addict.
I'm a habitual user.
I'm sick of you and that nut case
Going around judging everybody.
"Oh, he's an addict."
"Oh, he's basically honorable
Except for his treatment of women."
I am not a womanizer.
In fact, I hate womanizers.
In any case, Alice completely changed all that.
Isn't that a little morbid?
Morbid?
Why take on all that baggage?
Isn't he a bit of a sicko?
From the start, you know he's defective.
Usually you don't find that out
Until much later.
And what if you have kids?
It can be hereditary.
One thing about Jimmy:
I know he'll make a good father.
There's always some problem, some baggage.
Oh, my god, you're serious.
Well, not necessarily.
Coming.
Tonight I'm gonna tell Jimmy.
Wish me luck.
You know, I think my father could have
Been an undiagnosed manic-Depressive.
Hi. Uh, do you know josh is downstairs waiting?
Yeah. Thanks.
Bye.
Bye. Bye.
Alice is so great.
I've gotta be a better friend to her.
Yeah.
Before leaving the D.A.'S office,
I'd like at least once the chance to use
The expression, "book this clown!"
Heh. I thought only police said that.
No, I think an a.D.A. Could,
In certain circumstances,
Perhaps not very typical.
Are you aware
All your clothes are slightly big?
I'm still waiting for my growing spurt.
Both my father and brother are over 6'3".
You can still grow in your twenties.
There are cases on record.
Tall people tend to have great personalities,
This kind, compassionate comprehension
Of the rest of the worid.
My father and brother are both that way.
What's wrong?
Just remembering something.
What?
It's kind of maudlin.
It was here
My depression first descended.
Oh.
"To the valiant seamen
"Who perished in the Maine
By fate unwarned, in death unafraid."
Isn't this the strangest,
Most forlorn monument?
Yeah, it's very sad.
What happened with your depression?
Nothing at first.
I just went back to
Cambridge very depressed.
Then there was the incident at the hayes-Bickford,
After which I was taken to mass. Mental for observation.
While there, I cut my hand trying to open a stuck window,
And they put me on a suicide watch,
Though I don't think I was ever really suicidal,
At least no more than a lot of people that age.
But you're ok now?
Uh... yeah.
Actually, a lot of people spend considerable sums of money
To get the high I get absolutely naturally.
Now, with lithium,
Which is, in fact, a naturally occurring salt,
I can stay on a perfectly even keel,
Perhaps too even.
Did they prescribe lithium right away?
Lithium wasn't so standard then.
There was a lot of muddling through various therapies.
Because my right hand was bandaged,
I used my left to write friends cards,
Which was a mistake.
My handwriting looked weird and really scared people.
I... I don't think
I was ever that... that badly off, but others might disagree.

No, nothing happened.
We were just talking.
About what?
Charlotte said she had something important
She wanted to talk to me about,
But before we got to that, her period started.
Afterwards, I mentioned that it might be a good time
To start thinking about
Whether we were really right for one another
Or we should start thinking about,
You know, breaking up.
Josh hasn't called since that night.
Of course he hasn't.
What do you mean?
Oh, come on. You told me.
He sang a hymn or something.
You were totally weirded out.

There are a couple of alternatives
That aren't that that-Bad.
First, some guy who's already been around a lot
And almost certainly has it anyway,
So it'd be no problem
And, in fact, would give you something in common.
The other would be some guy
So idealistic and in love with you
That he'd want to commit himself to you
Prior to that step because his dream would be
To be with you forever, always, exclusively anyway.
I think skip's a bit that way.
What?
I need to see des. It's urgent.
He's busy.
He'll wanna know this.
Des!
Des!
Des, open up!
I didn't let him in, des.

It's about to start.
Get rid of all your "gifts"
And anything else you might have.
Oh.

We're on the list.

Francesca was just feeling terribly needy tonight.
It has nothing to do with how I feel about Alice.
You're not gonna take unfair advantage of that.
Ok.

I'm a cop.
This way, gentlemen.
All right, let's go!

And as such, the warrant applies. Sam.

Hi.
What are you doing here in the dark?
I was just resting.
Have you seen josh at all?
Yeah.
Is he ok?
Sure.
Why wouldn't he be ok?
I don't know.
He hasn't called in a while.
Josh is a bit thin-Skinned.
He's the kind of guy who will take no for an answer.
Sag harbor.
Did you know I was sort of infatuated with you then?
I assumed you preferred Tom.
Also, you seemed a little... irritating.
How was I irritating?
Well... you weren't.
There's no chance of you
Getting infatuated with me again, is there?
Just had to confirm that.
Let me keep your passport for you.
No.
Come on, help me out.
Should people just be allowed
To steal from each other and the government,
And out of selfishness or indifference
Or a kind of fashionable cynicism,
The rest of us do nothing?
I thought better of you than that.
You did?
Well, wrong again.
Listen, you've got all their books and all their documents.
Why do you need me who knew practically nothing?
This is the only body I've got.
Good-Bye, josh.
Kennedy airport.
Are you a bit of a cad,
Leaving town with your girlfriend in the hospital?
It might look that way.
But it isn't?
I've been through this before.
After graduation,
Laurie and I were gonna break up,
But the same day,
She came down with terrible back spasms.
I hung around the hospital all summer,
And I almost bankrupted her parents.
And as soon as I left town, she recovered.
By going away and putting an ocean between us...
I.E., making a definitive break...
Charlotte's likely to recover much faster.
What makes you think putting an ocean between you
Necessarily means a definitive break?
That's a depressing thought.
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf in Spain.
I'm gonna turn over several new leaves.
You know that Shakespearean admonition,
"To thine own self be true"?
It's premised on the idea
That "thine own self" is something pretty good,
Being true to which is commendable,
But what if "thine own self" is not so good?
What if it's pretty bad?
Wouldn't it be better in that case
Not to be true to thine own self?
See? That's my situation.
The one I like is, "et tu, brute."
There are different ways of being loyal.
Some may seem on the surface disloyal,
But they're not.
There's a higher loyalty.
The way I see it,
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar.
By stabbing him in the back,
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar?
You know, I probably should have stayed and testified.
Josh is right.
Bernie is a bad guy, probably worse than they know.
That's what van thinks.
Van's cooperating.
Staying and cooperating would have been the right thing to do,
But instead I'm running like a rat
Because to thine own self be true.
They say I can probably go home tomorrow.
Great.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Do you think Jimmy's going away could have
Had anything to do with him, you know... having some sort
Of bizarre, pathetic crush on you?
I don't know.
Well, did he ever say anything?
Yes.
What?
Well, he...
"Why don't you love me
Instead of jerks like des and josh?"
That kind of thing?
I knew it.
You bitch!
I knew it was something like that.
I don't think I want to room with you anymore.
Being around you hasn't been good for me or my back.
I'd like you to move out.
I don't know how I'll afford it,
But my sanity and my integrity
Are more important to me than money.
I have to start looking out for myself now.
Have you heard the news?
No, what?
They're selling the company.
What?
We're merging with Simon & Schuster.
There'll be the usual consolidation
And economies of scale.
A lot of us are gonna lose our jobs.
God, that's sad.
I love the company.
They've been so great to us there.
Well, I don't know.
We were exploited,
But they were nice about it.
Maybe it'd be good if they got rid
Of some of the deadwood in that company,
Particularly if it meant paying the rest of us
Decently enough to live in this city
With at least a modicum of privacy.
Why don't we do something?
Like what?
Well, at this time of day,
Employed people often have lunch.
I can't. I've gotta go uptown.
Why?
Alice and I are having lunch.
You're having lunch with Alice?
Great. Let's all go.
It's, uh, at Lutece.
You're on unemployment
And taking Alice to Lutece?
Um, doesn't irrational expenditures
Signal the start of a manic phase?
If it were my invitation, you'd be right,
But it's not.
Alice is taking you to Lutece?
Why'd she take you?
Celebrating her promotion.
When Alice wants to celebrate something,
She calls you?
Alice made editor?
Associate editor.
Well, what happened with her book?
I thought it was some kind of fiasco.
What Alice did, rather cleverly,
Was shift the category
From nonfiction to self-Actualization.
The book jackets hadn't been printed yet.
Reincarnation, life after death...
Mumbo jumbo of all kinds
Has been highly commercial
Throughout the history of book publishing.
The first printed book was the bible.
Actually, I'm not upset I was laid off.
This'll motivate me to get a better job in television,
Which is where my interests truly lie.
I've watched television all my life.
If you're really
Interested in television,
You should come over and watch
Wild kingdom sometime.
Sure.
Are you taking the "e" train?
Yeah.
$2. Thanks.
Hey, van!
What happened?
Ah, the new owners couldn't make it work.
Finally had to hire people to stand outside,
Pretend that they couldn't get in.
Anyway, disco's over. It's dead.
What do you mean?
Well, people just aren't going out like they used to.
They're tired.
Some are sick or strung out.
It's not just the prosecutions
And all the owners that Bernie squealed on.
Could part of it be related to the herpes epidemic?
Maybe. I've got a friend
At Casablanca records and tapes,
And she says that, like, 2 months ago,
The bottom dropped out of all disco record sales.
Suddenly, it's... dead, over.
God, that's sad.
We're getting older.
We've lived through a period that's ended.
It's like dying a little bit.
Disco will never be over.
It will always live in our minds and hearts.
Something like this, that was this big
And this important and this great,
Will never die.
Oh, for a few years, maybe many years,
It'll be considered pass? And ridiculous.
It will be misrepresented
And caricatured and sneered at,
Or worse, completely ignored.
People will laugh about John Travolta,
Olivia newton-John, white polyester suits
And platform shoes and going like this.
Though we had nothing to do with those things
And still loved disco.
Those who didn't understand will never understand.
Disco was much more and much better than all that.
Disco was too great
And too much fun to be gone forever.
It's got to come back someday.
I just hope it will be in our own lifetimes.
Sorry. I've got a job interview this afternoon,
And I was trying to get revved up,
But most of what I said, I, uh, believe.
I was pretty furious when you had
My passport lifted, confiscated,
At the airport, but you were right.
I'm glad I stayed.
At least you saved me
From being stuck in some foreign city
With the likes of Jimmy Steinway.
But there's one thing I don't get.
You did a good job with the prosecution,
Getting Bernie to squeal that way.
Why'd they lay you off?
There was a conflict involving
Giving preferential treatment to a friend
Which they felt I handled badly.
Oh.
Well, congratulate Alice for us.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't envy her, though, stuck in book publishing.
Oof. Yeah.
I've gotta get to unemployment and sign up.
I'm going to Florida this afternoon.
So long.
Bye. Bye.
One of the things that makes me happy in life
Is knowing that I don't envy anyone.
I don't want to be anybody else
Or do anything but what I'm doing,
Which, right now, is nothing,
But I have good projects for the future.
Can I speak honestly?
Yeah.
You and I are similar.
We both got big personalities.
That's good. The worid, frankly, needs more big personalities.
But perhaps ours burn too brightly,
Are too big for people with normal,
Healthy-Size personalities like Alice
Or abnormal, healthy-Sized personalities like josh
Or itsy-Bitsy, teeny-Weeny,
Polka-Dot-Bikini-Size personalities
Like Jimmy Steinway.
That's why I'm confident
I'll ultimately be successful in television.
Absolutely. See, one of the problems
Of finding the right person and settling down
Is it takes all the fun and interest
Out of going to nightclubs.
I mean, if you're already living with somebody,
Why bother going out?
Getting seriously involved with someone
Really just means ruining your nightlife.
What I mean to say is,
Jimmy, Alice, Josh... so what?
That's what I say.
I think I agree with you.

From the top, then, lads.
I think you can use the Stones as markers.
They certainly captured the times.
The hippy, peace, love, acid thing has long gone, and they're different times.
There was something in the air,
Coppola was making Apocalypse Now.
There was definitely the sense that the Sixies didn't work, and that you either had to blow up the system or flee from it.
From the artwork to the music, it was a Rolling Stones record that wasn't the big, popular album.
What year was it? '72?
I know the folklore, obviously.
They were getting away from, running away from England.
Why did they...?
So they literally got booted out.
English tax exiles. Seemed to be a popular English rock'n'roll story.
They had to go and almost implode, in a way.
The sense of being exiled, the sense of being..."You can't go home."
I think this music reflects that.
He's going the wrong way.
We used to go that way.
Let's go the way we used to go.
When I started talking about making this film,
I said, "We're never gonna do this.
"We're never gonna go to where we recorded it."
That was your booth.
You lived in there.
I didn't, I wasn't always,
I was out here a lot.
= That was my booth.
= Only when we let him.
We used to try experimental things, cos it was a nice, big room.
One bloke could be there, while I was here, doing something else.
We did a lot of versions of things.
We did them over and over.
The thing about Exile On Main St. is that there wasn't a master plan, we just accumulated material knowing that we would use it one day.
So we just came in and recorded.
This is really weird. You come back to something you did 40 years ago, it doesn't really matter.
You've got to look back at the big picture, you got really good things out of it.
= Where were we? Boring, really.
= That's about as good as it gets.
That old fucking recording session...
I mean, boring.
Who gives a shit?
The Lucifer of Rock, the Pied Piper, the rebellious young millions, who, in the 1960s, made rock music the official language of their unfocused, but unmistakable affection, from tradition...
Middle America couldn't believe what was happening to their kids.
They were listening to this music, buying their albums, album covers with pictures of the boys lying around in homes, making parents sick.
People across the country thought,
"What can we expect nex from the Stones?"
American Top 40.
The second=biggest foreign act ever to hit the American charts has had five number one singles and ten consecutive gold LPs.
The green stuff they gather isn't moss.
The Rolling Stones.
Are you any more satisfied now?
Financially, dissatisfied.
You know...
Sexually, satisfied.
Philosophically, trying.
We'd been working hard, we were a very successful band, we'd sold a lot of records but we weren't getting paid, cos the record contracts were giving us such a low royalty.
We found out that we had a management company guy who claimed that he owned everything we were doing in the past and always would in the future.
Touring, records, publishing songs, everything, he said he owned it.
So we had to get rid of him and try and get out of this ridiculous Byzantine mess that you've created for yourself.
We were supposed to live this life, limousines, you had to have, and this, that and the other.
The money just flew, so you were always in debt.
None of us had paid tax.
We thought we had.
We thought that had been dealt with, and it hadn't.
Tax, under the Labour government of Wilson was 93%.
If you earned a million quid, which we didn't, you'd end up with 70 grand.
So it was impossible to earn enough money to pay back the Inland Revenue and stay here, in England.
It was a feeling that you're being edged out of your own country.
The British government were scared by the number of fans we had, I suppose.
They couldn't ignore that we were a force to be reckoned with, and sometime in the end of the year we had to make the decision.
It was like, well, we all wanted to keep going, so let's just move.
We're not rooted in England, we'd been around the world half the time.
We do this farewell tour of England which is quite short, and rather sort of sad.
I can remember it so vividly.
Everyone thought we were never going to come back.
We had this kind of settled way of life for a touring band.
We were all very kind of English in our ways, with our semi=suburban studios, nice country places to live in, and we were quite happy with that.
I mean, "sedate" is not really the right...
It wasn't sedate, but it was pretty centred.
This kind of lifestyle that we'd created for ourselves, which was really pleasant, had to come to an end.
How do you feel about emigrating?
I don't know. Are we really going?
Well, so they tell me.
= Do you want to leave England or not?
= No.
You're not keen on it?
= On what?
= On going off to France.
You keen on England?
In those days, if a band was big in England and then left England, that was the end of them, you didn't like them any more.
It's fucking curtains.
And then, when you leave for tax reasons, it's really not very cool.
I had to get out of the country to pay the tax incurred for me.
That's why I had to leave.
Let that be a warning to you.
I start taking pictures of the Stones in 1964.
I heard that the whole band was moving to the South of France, so, a few weeks later,
I was down in Nice.
I asked, "Do you think it's possible
"to take a few pictures of the Stones in the South of France?"
And they gave me the name of the place,
Villefranche=sur=Mer, Villa Nellcote.
I just went for an afternoon.
I didn't know Keith and Anita were living down there.
Of course, the house was beautiful and the light is incredible in the South of France in spring.
At the end, I was thanking everybody for a beautiful afternoon and everything, and they said to me, "You can stay."
How long were you there for?
Six months.
Admiral Byrd built it.
He was an English admiral.
Steps down to his own private boating dock.
So I bought a speedboat.
"Splash out, I might be in jail..."
"Let's have some fun while I'm free."
That whole era, just before we moved to France, was all kind of jittery, so in a way it was quite a relief to get to France and have that off your back and start learning French.
Anita in Nellcote.
First off, it was her first year with the baby, so she was being mother, as well, and just, sort of, made sure the joint ran properly.
She was the only one that could argue with the cook, Fat Jacques.
Until I had Marlon we were just living in hotel rooms, moving around constantly.
So, for me, going to the South of France was great.
It was a wonderful place.
It was very romantic.
I lost, totally, my sense of time, down there.
It was like a kind of dream, you know.
Every morning, Keith would be up at 8:00, 8:30 in the morning, and ready to jump in his car, looking after his kid, Marlon.
No one knew the Stones in the South of France, so that they were able to act and live normally.
We'd go to the zoo, we would go to the beach.
In the afternoon,
Anita would look after Marlon, and Keith would play music.
Every morning it would be the same.
It was a normal way of life.
We've been seeing a lot in the music papers over here, some pictures of you and a very beautiful lady called Bianca.
= I believe.
= Yeah.
And all those rumours, that you must have read about, anything to say about them?
= No.
= In a word!
Not really.
What can I say, but rumours, rumours...
Mick Jagger came to St Tropez for a quiet wedding.
It's been chaotic and it's brought the town to a standstill.
We knew they was getting married, and we kind of knew the date, we were thinking,
"Well, it's on on Saturday,
"and Mick hasn't mentioned it.
"Maybe we'd better buy him a wedding present."
Then Mick called up the day before the wedding and said, "Hi, Bill. I'd like to invite you to our wedding reception."
And I said, "OK. Thanks."
So, it was a bit strange.
= You can stop taking photographs.
= Shut up, man.
People came from all over the world for the wedding.
Some musician had to go back on tour or recording, or something like that, and some other had nothing to do.
So, like usual, it ends up at Keith's house.
In the South of France, if you have money you can get anything.
On the right you've got Marseilles, which is a very well=known place for illegal products, and on the other side, you've got Italy, with the Mafia.
So, you join the two together, and you understand.
I had a non=verbal agreement with Keith.
This was very simple.
You get high on music and photography, stick to it, I take care of the rest.
At the beginning, it was interesting and fun, but the thing is, it was fantastically disruptive.
Of the band, of our lives, of our social life, everything.
I hated leaving England.
I did, because, when you got down there, you had to try to replace everything you loved, cos it wasn't there.
You had to, sort of, buy... try to buy PG Tips to make your tea.
Then you had to deal with the French milk, which wasn't the same.
Then you bought Bird's Custard and Branston Pickle and piccalilli and all the English things you were used to in your life, you had to import them all because they weren't there.
I'm not a very good mover.
And no, I didn't like...
And I was English and I couldn't see living in France, and that.
I mean, the mental thing was a bit, sort of... strange.
You were in exile, particularly me,
I couldn't speak French or anything.
I joined the Stones May or June of '69, and so, I hadn't earned enough money or done enough work on that level to have any kind of tax problems.
But one of my most vivid memories is being flown there in our own private jet.
I thought, "My God. This is the high life, this is wonderful."
We looked around for studios, but, especially in the South of France in the early... in 197 1, there was no good rooms to work in, and the equipment was shabby, and nobody felt comfortable in anywhere we looked at.
We tried various cinemas and public halls that one might rent, and we just never found a suitable site.
In the end, we chose convenience,
I suppose, over sound, and went for the basement of Keith's house.
We said, "We have this truck, our own mobile studio.
"Why don't we just forget about them and just bring in the truck
"and work around the problems?
"At least, this way, we don't have to ask our interpreter
"every time we want to turn it off or on."
Good afternoon!
Basically, I think that the Stones really felt like exiles.
"It's us against the world now.
Fuck ya."
That was behind the attitude.
We said,
"We're all gonna do this, boys.
"We're all just gonna move out and be a family and do it,
"and here's the place."
And, in a way, it was energising.
I ended up there because that's where everybody else went.
My boys that I play rock'n'roll with left the country.
We were invited to go and we went.
I didn't mind living between Nice and Monte Carlo.
Didn't mind that a bit.
Didn't mind all the pretty girls around the countryside.
Yes, sir, buddy.
South of France and a young man in his 20s, a rock'n'roll musician, that's a mighty good combination.
I'm tellin' ya!
That's when you're shitting in tall cotton.
Can you say that?
I just said that.
The Stones, during that time, were quite spread out across the South of France, so it was a little difficult to get everyone together for long periods at a time.
They'd get together for a few days and then everybody would want to go home and see their families.
Then there was the fact that Bianca was in her late stages of pregnancy during that period, so Mick was constantly in Paris where Bianca was.
So it wasn't the best conditions at all.
I remember, we just couldn't seem to get started.
= There. Come in again.
= Charlie should...
Yeah, it would make it so...
Andy, could you turn the piano up just a bit?
...just have the off beat.
Charlie, did you get that?
Do you want to try that?
It would be nice to change the drum sound when it comes back in again.
I'd just moved to France, and I used to have to drive, a six=and=a=half, seven=hour drive from where I lived, on these little roads.
I couldn't do it every night, play and go home, so I lived with Keith.
I lived in a room upstairs and Keith lived in a huge bedroom above that.
We had... It was quite...
I mean, it was pretty together, really.
In a mad sort of way.
We would work any time in 24 hours.
So, if it was 1 1 o'clock at night it would go for another 12 hours, or if it was at 12 o'clock midday, it would go for 12...
You know, whatever time.
That's why you had to live there.
I'm 21 years old, and there I am in the South of France, working with the best band on the planet, getting paid good cash money.
Come on, it was pretty cool!
It was my initiation into how you can actually live rock'n'roll.
At that point in time, the Rolling Stones were the centre of the world.
I might have been somewhat delusional, but music was very important back then.
It was the heyday of...
"Music's going to change the world."
All that rubbish.
And they were changing the world.
What a lot of people forget is, they were doing it, they really were.
The Rolling Stones, at the time, it's not a five=piece band any more.
It is an eight=piece band, with the horns,
Jim Price, Bobby Keys, with Nicky Hopkins.
And, all those people, they have kids.
And it's like, the Rolling Stones, it's like a tribe.
During the night, all those musician and technicians, during the day, all those kids.
So, it's impossible to separate the family life from the professional activity downstairs.
The tribe grows bigger and bigger and bigger.
Running.
Which amps are you coming out of?
Now he asks us.
That Fender...
The basement of Keith's house was in fact a lot of separate rooms, that made up a basement.
In the end, the separation was so poor that we would have to have the piano in one room, an acoustic guitar in the kitchen, because it had tile, so it had a nice ring.
There was another room for the horns.
And there was one, probably, main studio, where the drums were, and Keith's amp, and Bill would stand in there but his amp would be out the hall.
The place was absolutely atrocious and was very, very difficult to deal with.
It was so humid and the guitars would go in and out of tune all the time.
And Mick kept complaining about the sound and...
The gear wasn't working properly, the lights would go off, and there were fires, and it was just insane.
It wasn't the best conditions at all.
It was difficult for all of us.
The wires would go out the door and down the hall into a mobile truck.
Every time I wanted to communicate,
I would have to run around to all the different rooms and give the message.
Should we listen to it?
Well, I broke the string on that one.
A lot of Exile was done how Keith works, which is: play it 20 times, marinate, play it another 20.
Keith's very like a jazz player in lots of ways.
I mean, he knows what he likes, but he's very loose.
Keith's a very Bohemian and eccentric, in the best terms, person.
He really is.
I never plan anything.
Which is probably the difference between Mick and myself.
Mick needs to know what he's gonna do tomorrow,
I'm just happy to wake up and see who's hanging around.
Mick's Rock, I'm Roll.
I wanted to be a hotshot record executive, and they were the Rolling Stones, they had their own record label.
Atlantic distributed Rolling Stones records, we got a dollar an album and a big budget to produce the records.
The whole deal was, "Can you get the Rolling Stones to make an album
"every year or 18 months?
"Cos they're floating around, they're flying around."
And I said, "Yeah. I can do that."
Then I started to watch their creative process.
Watch how it worked.
I was amazed that Keith could fall asleep while he was doing a vocal.
Mick wouldn't show up.
I was coming from...
You had to make three sides in three hours.
These guys were taking two weeks to get one track done.
Sometimes I didn't have an idea, so I'd just throw it out and just see what happens.
You get the best out of this band when they think they're not working.
Where it's...
"This is just a free=for=all."
And, as long as the tape's rolling, this is where you get it.
That whole period was incredibly creative for all of us.
Once we got into a studio and picked up our guitars, we were in our own world.
Nothing else could really get in the way.
Trying to make the songs up, there's a riff, there's a groove, and you're trying to make up the words and a melody.
So the writing process was very, very loose.
We started off just jamming.
Really casual. Hung together.
It always ended up great.
That was the great thing about it.
It was about as unrehearsed as a hiccup.
It just was...
It wasn't exactly spontaneous combustion.
Placed a call to...
Give George Harrison my best wishes.
Not to mention his old lady.
This was a whole different approach to music and recording from what I'd been used to.
Usually you know the name of the song you're playing.
This is a...
And then there should be a chord...
The one that's great on that is Ventilator Blues.
You always rehearse it and it's a great riff, but we never do it as good as that, something is not right.
Either Keith would play it a bit different, which is not the same, or I'll get it wrong.
That's because Bobby said,
"Why don't you do this?"
I said, "I can't play that."
He said, "Yeah. It's this."
And stood nex to me, clapping.
I just followed his time.
Where I ever had the balls to try to tell Charlie Watts where two and four was, is beyond me.
I have often thought to myself,
"Son, what were you smoking,
"or what were you drinking?"
God bless his heart and patience, he listened to me.
There you go, you hear it right here,
I taught Charlie Watts how to play the drums.
I don't think we've ever said,
"Let's make this kind of album or that kind."
They take on their own character, once you start to get into it, since we'd left the country and were recording in a totally different way.
I wanted to reduce it back to basics.
It's been said that the Stones gave black music back to the Americans, what were the first black musicians that turned you on to black music?
Chuck Berry, Little Richard.
Little Richard was the first one
I heard that really knocked me out.
After that, Chuck Berry, and later Bo Diddley,
Muddy Waters, Jimmy Reed.
Slim Harpo.
The list gets endless but...
I guess the more you got into black music the more you followed it back to where it come from.
And so, eventually, you were listening to Robert Johnson,
Blind Lemon Jefferson, et cetera, everybody goes through that.
To me, even now, American players and singers are always the best.
It is one of those sort of things that you have going. It is for me.
But then I'm a black American freak, cos that's the music I like, primarily.
That's the only...
That's really the music I love.
It was a super eclectic band.
I was brought up in the '50s.
I liked pop music,
I didn't just like blues.
I loved blues, but I loved Elvis, but I loved crap pop music, like acoustic blues music, country music.
We liked everything, plus you've got all these other people, and you're kinda throwing this whole mishmash in.
We'd absorbed so much different kinds of music since we'd become the Rolling Stones.
Maybe we missed America, I don't know.
Mick and I had always loved country music anyway.
You're playing the Midwest in 1964, '65, you ain't going to hear much else.
It's the other side of rock'n'roll.
Rock'n'roll, basically, is your blues and they put under a little bit of white hillbilly melody.
It's the coming together, it's that lovely... which music's always about, is one culture hitting another.
Hillbillies ideas of subject matter are like really interesting, and there's a lot of very...
In all of that music, there's a lot of things that just keen into your heart.
One of the things about Exile,
I think, was a lot of stuff that we'd picked up on the road and along the way came out.
You've drawn from whatever you've listened to since you were a child.
Probably, some of the things
I write or play are things that I listened to in 1947.
Rock'n'roll in its basic sense is a mixure.
What I've always loved about it, when I thought about it... it's a beautiful synthesis of white music and black music.
And it's just a beautiful cauldron to mix things up.
My father was in that world.
He was a race car driver, drug smuggler and adventurer.
We were there for, I guess, about three months, as Keith and Anita's long=term guests.
There was a lot of down time in Nellcote.
The creative process happened gradually throughout the day, as far as I could see.
Remember, I was just a kid.
People would sit around and play guitars, and start picking little bits of music, and then, late at night they would get busy.
From the top then, lads.
The basement, at night, was the epicentre, and as long as we could stay awake, we were down there.
It was kind of the adult area, because there was a lot of drinking and smoking, and there were bottles of Jack being passed around.
It was loud and a little bit scary, but it was also, before it got wild, a place where we all wanted to be.
It was so loud.
It was really, really loud.
I went to Villefranche sometimes, in the evening, and I could hear the music from Villefranche.
And I'm amazed that the people there were so patient, because it was always going, it was going all night.
It got really hot, especially down in the basement where they were recording.
It was like a sauna.
Dingy and dark.
I don't know how they did it, quite honestly.
It was really an exreme labour of love,
I think.
No.
The same again.
Leave it a whole other one before...
No. Charlie don't come in till later.
= You add just the guitar?
= Later, on the C.
And Bill come in with him?
Yeah, and Mick, MT, where does Mick come in?
= When he feels it, not too...
= When you feel it, Mick.
I'll give you a yell, something like middle eight...
What would really happen was this:
They would play very poorly for two or three days on whatever song, and then, if Keith got up and started looking at Charlie, then you knew that something was about to go down.
Then Bill would get up and put his bass at that sort of 84=degree angle, and you went, "Ah, here it comes.
They're going to go for it now."
Then it would turn into this wonderful, God=given music.
OK. Here it comes.
Run up to the D and E.
= All right?
= All right.
Got your lead sheets?
Once you're into the recording, everything else is a bit peripheral.
We'd be down in the basement, working, working, but the odd time you come up to the surface, oh, they'd be partying up there.
So you never knew quite what you were going to meet.
Nellcote was never empty.
There was people all over the place.
Some people sprawled out, and say, "I can't make it home."
"Have the couch. Have the big couch."
Had a couple of mad French cooks that blew the kitchen up.
But, apart from that, there was no mayhem, particularly.
Fat Jacques. He said they blew it up.
He was a junkie too.
He used to go to Marseilles.
"Where's Jacques?"
"It's Thursday."
"Oh right. He's gone to score."
I was commuting back and forth to Nellcote from all over the world.
Dealing with Atlantic, seeing about a worldwide simultaneous release.
It became my life.
When you're at work with the Rolling Stones, you won't last unless it becomes your life.
I remember, vividly, late afternoon, early evening, one meal a day.
We'd all sit at this long, long table.
We would all smoke joints and hash in between courses.
We had this big bowl, and everybody would be passing it around.
It was a whole new La Dolce Vita,
Felliniesque kind of lifestyle.
I actually became, in my mind, like one of the Rolling Stones.
You'd be surprised what an eight=and=a=half=year=old kid sees.
They see everything.
They're like little owls.
Obviously, there was cocaine, because Dad brought it.
I remember a lot of joints.
We'd roll joints.
That was, I think, pretty much my function in life at that point, was to be a joint roller.
If you're living a decadent life, there's darkness there.
This was decadent.
Nothing was hidden.
Everything was out in the open.
But at this point, this was the moment of grace.
This was before the darkness.
This was, if anything, the sunrise before the sunset.
Hell, yeah, there was some pot laying around, there was whisky bottles around, champagne bottles around, there was scantily=clad women around.
Hell! It was rock'n'roll, son!
Without it, you ain't got rock'n'roll.
Everybody had a great time, but it was very stressful, if you know what I mean.
You were having a good time, but ready to go back home.
The only one who wasn't like that was Keith, who was being supplied in his mansion, with the band working downstairs.
Must have been heaven for him.
Late again, Richards.
I don't envy you when you grow up and have to go to work for a living.
Sometimes I would wake up and I would just hear this weird rumbling from the basement.
And then realise that I'd slept for nearly a whole day, and they were working on.
But sometimes if Jimmy Miller was there, and enough people to operate the machinery,
I'd say, "Let's start."
They'd say, "There's nobody here."
I said, "I'll do for now."
It was like, whoever's around, and you had an idea,
"OK, round 'em up and let's go."
I cut Happy with Jimmy Miller on drums, and Bobby Keys on baritone sax, and me on guitar.
That was basically the take.
Everybody would go in and out of the place as they wished, so I kind of got really paranoid, it was unbelievable.
I walked into the living room and there was this guy sitting on the sofa, he pulled out a bag full of smack.
The whole thing kind of disintegrated and we got heavily into drugs, like breakfast, lunch and dinner.
At the end, especially,
I thought I was cursed.
We're getting our souls back!
I wasn't that aware, at the time, cos I was so used to it being around me.
At the time it was just Keith, it was how we worked.
He's always led life his way, and I don't think they cared what you thought or I thought.
I did it, basically, to hide.
Hide from fame and being this other person, because all I wanted to do was play music and bring my family up.
With a hit of smack,
I could walk through anything, and not give a damn.
Middle of September, what happens?
Keith and all his entourage, and all these guests and friends and hangers=on, are all in, watching television, and someone breaks in and steals eight guitars, one bass and a saxophone, of Bobby Keys.
Just walks out the house and no one even knows.
That's how, like, loose and stupid it was out there.
It's a big group of people, and they're dependent on the creative engine.
If it starts to get out of whack and doesn't work efficiently, everyone's going to suffer in some way.
You think you're in control of this wonderful, enjoyable lifestyle, and there's a moment where you are, but then, what happens is, the lifestyle starts to choose you.
That's the problem.
Suddenly, it was getting cold and autumn, and we'd got all of this stuff that we'd recorded in a truck, in a basement.
Mick and I were looking at each other, saying,
"I think we've drained it.
And we've drained everybody else."
There was a sort of a group feeling, I think,
"That's it, we've done it."
I can't even remember people leaving, but they certainly left, all very quickly.
Me and Keith and a couple of other people were still down there and eventually we got the word that we had to leave, because we were gonna get arrested.
We never got busted and we never got thrown out.
Now, did it become somewhere where we shouldn't stay?
Yeah, but we never got thrown out.
I felt like an outlaw,
I kind of quite liked that, the feeling of,
"We can't go anywhere."
You didn't have any choice, you can't get high any more, so get another buzz.
We always went to LA to finish our records.
That was a sort of... our modus operandi.
So we went off to LA.
It was kind of fun playing it to lots of musicians and friends in LA, interesting to get their input, cos everything that went on at Nellcote, it was in a bubble really.
We'd never made a double album before, so we didn't quite...
I think we were a bit naive about it.
It was just a bit too much work, considering that we'd had all these pressures, plus we were just a bit burned on it.
I remember Keith even saying,
"I'm so burnt out on this record."
But we still got loads of unfinished songs.
Some of them had fragmentary lyrics and some had none at all.
So we had a big mountain to climb.
It's weird, where your lyric things come from.
Tumbling Dice,
I sat with the housekeeper and talked to her about gambling.
She liked to play dice and I didn't know much about it, but I got it off her and I made the song out of that.
Casino Boogie would have been a song with no lyrics, so Keith and I did this William Burroughs thing, where we did cut=ups.
I just wrote phrases and chucked them into a pile and picked them out.
"Anything goes!
We've got to get this done."
We went to Sunset Sound to finish the record off.
My vocals had to be done, the harmony vocals and Keith's vocals.
We did pedal steel guitars, upright bass.
Exra musicians of some kind that we hadn't already thought of.
A lot of background vocal stuff.
The first part was good, but you've got to keep it up.
Those overdubs, they give the songs a complete twist.
So this LA experience is a lot about that.
A little bit of those girls goes a tremendous long way.
All these little jams, like
I Just Want To See His Face, that I'm going off on some religious bent, suddenly come alive and you see,
"That's what I meant when I was singing it."
There was a lot of material and I kept throwing new things on it.
That's always slightly bewildering.
We had to choose the songs we liked, choose the takes, and to sit in this room for...
I don't know how long, and sort everything out.
They'd mix forever. Keith would do mixes and Mick would do mixes and then they'd argue which one was the best.
It used to go on and on and on.
We needed a cover, so as you were mixing the record that you'd done,
Mick and I would be looking through books just to see styles and things like that.
Charlie and I went to loads of book shops in LA, bought loads of photography books.
And Charlie came up with this idea of Robert Frank.
Robert was perfect for that period, very American, of the '50s and '60s, very iconic.
We imagined it would be a photograph of the Rolling Stones, you know, stark Robert Frank imagery.
Then Robert said, no, he didn't see it like that, he saw doing photography with Super 8.
I said, "We'll give it a whirl."
He can see something that you wonder what the hell he's looking at.
When it's done with him and finished, it will look fantastic.
I have always thought, somewhere in the back of my mind, that what we were doing wasn't just for now.
So you're making the record even when you're asleep.
So I was dreaming the damn thing.
There might have been a feeling that,
"Right, since we've decided to move out of England,
"well, we better make this bloody work."
Finally, it's not that thing, you're stuck in a basement, trying to work out what the fuck is going on.
Now, we've finished this record.
All we have to do is wrap it up in this gritty little package.
The billboards. Fantastic.
It's up there.
It's going to be out and then you're on the road playing it, and it's exciting.
Mick doesn't like the finished thing.
He won't like this when it's finished.
He won't let you finish this.
That's what he's like.
Mick doesn't like anything you did yesterday.
Let's do tomorrow.
Which, in one way, is very good, cos it keeps you going forward.
It is a different kind of record.
It's a very sprawling, gutsy piece of work.
Criticism of Exile, it didn't have a direction.
But then, that's also something very laudable about it, that it exhibits all these styles, and even multiple styles, in one song.
Does it have tons of hit singles in it?
No. This isn't that kind of record.
Over the years it's just acquired a kind of magical glow.
Probably because of the way it was recorded, the rawness of it, the edginess of it.
I loved the tracks, obviously, but I don't think we had hardly any good reviews on that album.
By anybody.
They were all boo=hooing it and saying it was a load of crap, and it wasn't like the Stones.
And they all did amazing U=turns in the nex few years, saying it was one of the greatest albums we'd ever done.
I just wanted to make music and see how sounds are made.
How do you transmit that feeling and it actually comes back out and touches people?
It's been the mystery of my life and I'm still following it.
The Rolling Stones.
Rolling Stones. Crazy Mick. Crazy Mick.
Lay a couple of tickets on your friend.
It's the highest debuting song of the week, it's called Tumbling Dice by the phenomenal rock group that Time magazine says some far=out things about:
"The fan allegiance is not to rock as music,
"it's to the Stones as a socio=sexual event."
KROQ, Los Angeles, a rock revolution, is happening with the Rolling Stones!
Get down!
Exile On Main St. Dramatically altered the vocabulary of record making.
There are texures on there that no one ever laid down before.
That's so crazy, this was in France, cos it sound...
Literally, I thought, every night, they were in Memphis and they were going out and eating barbecue, and partying and getting with women.
If it wasn't for this record,
I would have thought the Stones just did this.
But this is like peaks and valleys of creativity and expression.
I love that record because it's sort of like something that could really confuse a journalist.
Make him rethink his whole career, because he can't box the Stones in any more.
I mean, there's 15 directions going on at once.
I think that anybody who was cool wanted to be there while it was all happening.
I would have been there.
I'm sure of it.
This is almost as if you were there while they were in a room trying to pull together a song.
And this is almost saying,
"This is who we were and this is where we're going.
"And we're not going back."
When it comes to rock'n'roll music it's like...
It's like...
"How good does it get?"
Often when you go back to places, like where I was brought up, it doesn't look anything like that any more, it's completely and utterly different.
There's like a motorway underneath this and now that's a mall and you can't recognise it, whereas this, it's completely, exactly the same.
I had this house from 1970 to 1975.
It does have a lot of memories = one reason is that we recorded here = but it has other memories for me, too.
Children, my parents and that sort of thing.
My brother lived here a lot.
= Did he?
= Yeah.
He liked it very much, having this very large house.
= Who wouldn't have liked it?
= I don't blame him!
I'll follow you.
Here we go.
The beginning of the recordings of Exile On Main St. Were done in this house so the earliest recordings for Exile On Main St. Were done here.
And they were what?
Do you remember?
Sweet Black Angel was done here.
= Oh, is that here?
= Yeah.
We recorded the percussion out on the lawn on a very nice day.
And some of the other tracks that we've found that were exras on Exile that we've been recording, they also were done here.
So the earliest recordings of Exile were done in this house.
We built this...
We built this mobile truck.
= Oh, that's right!
= We built the mobile truck so that we could go anywhere we wanted in the world and record.
Yes, it was in those heady days.
And so we bought this mobile truck which was actually, really, a good piece... quite a good piece of machinery, I mean, efficient and good sound and all that.
And so, we...
This, I think, was one of the first places we brought it.
It was always freezing cold when you went to go and listen to the playback.
It was always freezing cold, you had to cross the garden and put it out.
So we just set it up and everyone lived here.
We would all put our amps up in here and I remember that we had quite a lot of brass on the recordings we did in here and I remember them being up there.
Bobby Keys and Jim Price were up there.
Yeah, I remember them being up there.
And they, you know...
I remember being down here directing them.
"Hey, do it again!
Come on, you can do better than that."
Where would you have been set up?
In there, with the baffles coming round the screen.
= And them lot leaning over.
= Yeah, saying,
"No, it shouldn't go 'kah, boom, boom', it should go 'boom, boom, kah'."
Were you pleased with the sound you'd get in here?
Yeah, it was a great sound.
In a small little box, you get a very bad drum sound so you have to trick the drum sound out with all kinds of echoes.
In a big, ambient room like this, you get a very big drum sound which, in those days, was...
You can move things in big rooms, that's what's so good.
Like the brass didn't have very good ears, so you go up there, or you go...
We used all the rooms to record in.
So we would put amps in all these different rooms to get different sounds and... I don't think you moved the drums, did you, Charlie?
Oh, I don't think so.
And you weren't allowed to, so no.
This was like a, kind of like, hanging out room.
= It still is, innit?
= And this one...
= I mean, different sort of hanging out.
= I can't remember what we did in here.
= Nor can I.
= We used to put amps in all these rooms.
But they were all done up, but slightly more hippyish.
We had a pretty... I mean, sedate lifestyle is not really the right...
It wasn't sedate but it was pretty centred and it was pretty grounded in its own way.
Geographically, it was very grounded.
And we're all very kind of English in our ways.
And then we recorded in various locations, but we did record a lot in Barnes in Olympic.
So, we had to come to this crunch period where this kind of lifestyle that we'd created for ourselves, which was really pleasant, had to come to an end.
Including being in these kind of houses, for me anyway, living in them for long periods of time and working in them, sort of came to an end.
And that is the beginning of Exile On Main St.
Shall I tell you what was recorded here?
Shake Your Hips, Sweet Virginia.
Loving Cup.
I Just Want To See His Face.
I think that was done here.
= Are you sure?
= That was done in Nellcote.
= I don't think it was.
= I think it was.
I'll ask the question.
Stop Breaking Down, that was done here.
= Could well have been.
= I remember doing that here.
Casino Boogie was done here.
= You think so?
= Sure!
We have a lot of disagreements about this.
With the...
He's going the wrong way!
I can't remember.
We used to go that way.
Let's go the way we used to go.
You're being led along purely by instinct now, it's like a...
When I started talking about making this film,
= I said, "We're never gonna do this."
= That used to be a studio.
"We're never gonna go to where we recorded it."
That was your booth there, you lived in there.
= Did I?
= You used to get through the other...
No! I wasn't always. I was out here a lot.
That was my booth.
= Only when we let him.
= I was quite often here.
Playing the bongos with a bell around my neck.
That's always a good look.
I don't know what happened to...
I forgot it today. Fuck!
= What was the bell doing round your neck?
= It was a fashion accessory of the time.
= You had a bell, didn't you?
= No, I didn't.
= I remember you with a bell!
= No. I had a very colourful scarf.
We used to try experimental things, because it was a nice big room.
You could like sit in a circle and all play, or one bloke could be over there doing something while I was here doing something else.
Or I could be in that booth, or there was another studio you could go in, or you could be completely isolated, doing that kind of recording.
So there was a lot of...
That's why recording in a big room's good.
We didn't just book a three=hour session, did we?
We used to book a three=week session.
What we really did is we'd just accumulate the material, knowing that we would use it one day.
So we just came in and recorded.
So, Charlie and I are sort of disagreeing about what was recorded where, but it is written down on some list which I think is relatively accurate.
= Two blind people reading a book.
= Yeah.
Loving Cup.
There was a Loving Cup version done at Nellcote, but I'm pretty certain that one was done here, but... I don't know.
Charlie and I are arguing about
I Just Want To See His Face.
Stop Breaking Down, Robert Johnson blues, that was recorded here.
= Shine A Light was recorded here.
= Yeah.
I heard that the other day on the telly and it's fantastic, so loud.
= Yeah, your drums you mean?
= No, no, you singing.
Really? Oh, yeah.
So we did a lot of versions of things, we did them over and over.
= We still do.
= Yeah.
A lot of the good things were recorded here.
Rip This Joint.
That was recorded in Nellcote, wasn't it?
= I think so.
= Shake Your Hips. That was recorded here.
I mean... I'm not sure...
You said that was recorded at Stargroves when we were there.
We did a version of it there but we didn't use it.
What else did we used to do in here?
Take loads of drugs!
But we worked very hard during the drug=fuelled sessions.
The problem is, with recording, and if you take drugs, but even if you don't, that people will become in love with the process.
At Nellcote, we were there recording nine months.
And then we did one, two... three...
...four... five, six... seven, eight. Maybe nine tracks in that nine months. Maybe.
That's good going, one a month.
I mean, you should be able to do one a day, really.
I mean, you know, and come back to it...
One every two days.
= OK, where were we?
= That's about as good as it gets.
That old fucking recording session...
I mean, boring.
Who gives a shit?
I remember buying it, the day I bought it.
At home, I had two big speakers on either side of my bed.
I was in college and got in the right frame of mind and blasted it.
And it scared me.
That was my first reaction, was that...
There's something...
These guys have maybe gone off the deep end, there's something going on under this thing that's...
I wanna go there but I don't know if I'll survive it.
My friend Angelo, he's a massive Stones fan.
He's like, "Have you ever heard Exile?"
And I was like, "No".
I hadn't heard it.
And the first thing he did was show me the artwork and I was like, "Oh, wow! This is nasty!"
You know?
And then he played it for me and every song was just...
To me... I mean, they were writing songs that were anti=religion at times or questioning their faith, and every one of the songs sounded like a church song to me.
I mean every song had the boogie...
That kind of stuff or just really bluesy slow.
Just kind of interpretation, you know.
Beautiful.
And when I heard this, it changed everything
I thought about the Rolling Stones.
I would go to, like, old record stores and shop and just pile up my catalogue.
And this was one of them, you know?
From the artwork to the music.
And it was a Rolling Stones record that wasn't... you know, the big popular album.
So, if I had this in my collection, it symbolised that, you know, I was ultra...
I was mega=cool, right?
And, you know, when you're 18, 19 years old, and you have your little backpack of records...
Now, kids are walking around with, you know...
It's weightless, you know?
You're just flipping through things.
But if you had a backpack with just all the cool mega=stuff, you didn't care...
Now, these kids are walking around with a whole record store. Full of content.
But if you had the mega=ness in your backpack...
"What? You got that
Rolling Stones record?" "Yeah, yeah."
And this record in particular, was the first one that I felt like they finally had 100% confidence to just say, "Fuck you".
And they had the songs, they had the hits, so...
I mean, the record label couldn't say anything to them.
They had the songs but if you listen, intertwined in every song there is a big "fuck you" in some way.
I must have been 24, 23, and I was...
I had no television, you know,
I had no phone. I was living in this apartment and all I did was listen to Exile On Main St. over and over again, obsessively.
And it was so satisfying.
It was such a...
As a work, it's still my absolute favourite album of all time, ever.
It's my, you know, desert island, deathbed album.
Because it's just so satisfying in every...
Musically, emotionally, lyrically.
The stories that are told, the grandeur, the ruination.
You know? It's all there.
For me, Exile On Main St. is the rock and roll bible.
I think it's a perfect marriage of... electric blues with a tinge of country and soul music.
I think it's the height of the Rolling Stones for me, because I love Mick Taylor.
You can just feel kind of what was going on in their lives and in that atmosphere, while they were making that record.
There is an undercurrent to this thing that I can't put my finger on, even as someone who makes records.
I have no idea where this comes from.
And that's that foreboding, evil undercurrent.
I don't know that they intended that,
I don't even know that that's what was going on with them, but there's something.
From the photos on the cover, right?
You know, the minute you have a tactile connection to that record, there is a dark message to it.
Yeah... It's a mystery.
I don't know what that's about.
You know, hit the cover and you'll get to hear like, you know...
= Like a sample of it.
= A sample of the songs.
You were going off of the art, you know?
When the art of a record, you know, gave you a vision of what it might sound like.
Nobody knows what that means but it offends everyone for some reason.
Everything, like, has this vulgar and sleazy... in like a great way, made every...
In my opinion, made me a guy who was, you know, for a part of my life
I was scared of rock and roll cos I thought it was the opposite of what was real and what was right.
And when I heard this record, it made you feel good about it.
I miss the hair.
They had great hair back then.
If you had that hairdo and you were from England, it was a good hairdo.
If you were from America, it was a mullet.
Never understood that.
It's all about the freaks.
It's all freaks and that's how they felt.
They were the freaks. They were these huge rock stars but they were freaks.
And that's how they felt and that's how they walked through, like a freak show.
I mean, I know a little bit about fame and you do feel like a freak.
To me, that's that point of view, as you said, the narrative in the entire album.
It's like being...
It's like looking through the eyes of a freak as they're looked at by everyone else.
I just...
God! The stories just crush me!
My impressions of what's going on in the stories of that record are all about being both sort of king of the hill and completely alienated from mainstream.
That's what Exile On Main St. Means to me.
That they are sort of rock stars so they're grand, they're above everything, so they're in it but they're not of it.
And so they're walking around,
Iooking at everything through the lens of alienation and, you know...
There's a lot of Ioneliness and there's a lot of heartbreak.
There's a lot of soul in the record.
It's a great thing...
It's an inspiring thing to see how hated it was when it came out and how revered it is now.
That's inspiring to know, you know, when you're releasing records yourself.
But... Yeah, it's just not accessible.
It's not poppy and accessible at all.
Like, it didn't have any poppy hits on it and I think that was confusing to people at the time, coming from the Stones.
But it was them at their best. I mean, the Stones, when they're at their best, are an incredible blues band and this is them doing that.
So... it's a perfect portrait of them.
When I heard this, it was 1994.
And I already knew, you know, the logo of the Rolling Stones.
It was imprinted in my brain. When I thought of the Rolling Stones, I thought of the logo.
I thought of Mick, you know.
You know, I thought...
The band, you know?
And this was, you know...
If it wasn't for this record, I would have thought the Stones just did this.
But this is like peaks and valleys of creativity and expression, you know.
There's education.
Cos it is '93 now, right?
This is an old record.
As well as all their other ones, you know?
But what it showed me was... to be an artist isn't just about, you know, popular songs, it's about a body of work, you know?
Eclectic, odd, avant=garde, straightforward, you know, on topic, off topic.
That's what groups are supposed to do.
Yeah, man, this whole record is just...
From the artwork to everything about it, you could tell they were just kind of at a point where they were going for it and didn't care if they were going to offend the masses.
It sounds like they had fun when they made the record.
You rarely hear a record that the people actually sound like they're having fun.
I don't talk to anyone about this record and I don't want to talk to people about it.
Like, it's my record.
It's my special, personal, private record.
With my boyfriend, he'd be like, "Let's put it on!"
I'm like, "No! I can't do that with you."
He probably wanted to have sex to it or something and I'm like, "No!"
You know what I mean?
Like that just can't be done for me.
Like I wouldn't put it on while... I wouldn't be able to eat dinner with this record on.
It would feel sacrilegious to me.
It would feel wrong.
That's a record that I can come to when I'm feeling like king of the world, or when I've just had my heart broken, or when someone just died, or when I need to, you know, find my musical bearings again.
It's a journey of sound.
Nowadays, we can go on and just click, you know, like a smorgasbord.
"I just want corn today."
And the chefs like, "Really, try this fish.
It goes great with the corn."
"No, no, no, I'm just gonna get the corn."
"But I prepared this wonderful fish that just...
Taste=wise...
"The spice and the fish goes great with the sweet corn."
"No, no, keep your motherfucking fish,
I just want the goddamn corn." Right?
And they have the opportunity to do that and they're missing out on a great meal, a great body of work, you know?
And this is one of them, where you put it on through the whole way and have it colour your time.
I love that record because it's something that could really confuse a journalist, sort of make him rethink his whole career, because he can't box the Stones in any more.
I mean, there's 15 directions going on at once.
I just love when they're befuddled like that.
They'd moved past the blues and gone into other areas of southern
American music, gospel and country.
I think they listened to the best of what American music had to offer.
They managed to combine, as I said, this sort of R&B and this electric blues with country music and with real deep southern soul music.
And even Mick's ability to portray an old black bluesman in the way he delivered his singing was kind of amazing, you know, for a scrawny little English guy.
I listen to it and I think it's the best of where I came from, you know, right along Route 66 and growing up on the Mississippi.
They managed to really draw from that and bring it into their English soul music.
I was born in Memphis and so I used to go down to Beale Street.
You'd hear guys on the corner just playing and you'd think,
"Man, those guys are better than anyone you could ever hear on the radio."
But you'll never hear them on the radio.
And then you have a band like this that just, you know, they worked really really hard and then just started to get where they could play.
They had the world at their fingertips and they could just play whatever kind of music they wanted.
In a lot of ways, with their music, they were trying to represent the people that were never going to make it on the radio.
America just, you know, didn't care about its true musicians, its true home=grown musicians.
They never cared.
They had some white guy redo it, which I guess this is the same thing, and then it was OK and it was fabulous.
But those, you know, early blues, the Deep South, those musicians, they never made the money they should have nor got the credit, nor got the accolades... till they were 90 or dead, you know what I mean?
That's kind of a depressing thought, that it took Englishmen to come in and kind of say,
"Hey, I think you might be onto something here", you know?
And there's something beautiful about the way they saw America and what parts of America they cherished, which was the... you know,
Deep South, African=American,
I like to call black, but, you know, music that just was truly American.
You can see the impact of blues through other genres and through other cultures, and then siphoned through and filtered through the Stones' sort of camera.
It's interesting to learn about yourself through somebody else's viewpoint and I think America was probably doing that but it just took a long time to allow that to take root, you know, with this record.
When people say devil music, that's devil music right there.
Damn fucking devil!
Sounds so good.
I Just Want See His Face is like... The first time I heard it, I was scared to death.
I was like, "Oh, no.
I'm gonna get struck dead", you know?
"I don't want to talk about Jesus,
I just wanna see his face."
Then they all talk about dropping to those knees and thanking God and it's like...
They pretty much covered everything.
And you know those black girls singing,
"I just wanna see his face"?
They do not agree with that.
They believe in Jesus, very much so.
There was a couple of things that took me by surprise and I thought were maybe done wrong but then they came back and they sounded incredible to me.
One was at the beginning of the track Ventilator Blues, after the first guitar licks happen, there should be a kick drum.
It should be..."When your...
"Spine is cracking..."
There should be a kick drum right there and there's not.
And that pissed me off when I first heard it and the drum start on the up, on the snare...
But now I love that, that's my favourite part about that.
You know, I always cock my head when that part comes in.
I think I'm gonna do Loving Cup.
I think that's one I like a whole lot.
That always made me wanna be...
Like I wanna, you know...
I remember, I would feel that...
Are you really gonna play it?
= Yeah!
= Hilarious! This is awesome.
Doesn't it just remind you of late nights and like...
You guys must have gone through the bar phase of your life, where you have no pride, you know?
I just love that.
Been through?
I could still be there, I don't know...
Listen to his vocals.
There's so much abandon in the vocal performances and in the guitar.
There's so much abandon. They're so unself=conscious, they're just letting it out.
It just feels like something folding out, like an elephant's trunk...
It wasn't, you know, just a joke that it might change the world.
It might actually sweep a youth culture into a new state of mind, like you actually had the potential to do that.
Don't you miss bands that actually disturb the social fabric?
Don't you miss that there was a social fabric to disturb?
What disturbs our fabric any more? Nothing.
Nobody does anything like that any more.
There aren't any rock stars any more.
I love Rip This Joint just cos it's so raucous but I would say that Sweet Virginia is probably the jam song of all time.
Like, if you don't know Sweet Virginia, then you need to go home.
And it is probably the one song that whenever you're sitting with a band, you can all play that song because it is part of our genetic history, as far as music is concerned.
Right. Now, is everyone settled?
I don't want anyone moving around.
I am a very nervous person.
What happened with Exile On Main St. was totally different.
And I think that the...
There's no doubt that they had this mantle of... representing the entire culture of rock and roll.
And they had to change, I think.
Or they felt they had to or wanted to change or felt they were searching for some other way to become...
How were they going to develop?
Where was their music gonna go?
How was it gonna develop into anything new?
And it was retaliation against everything that had come before, I think.
Not that they were repudiating any of their work, but they had to think differently and it seemed like a terrible struggle.
I was aware of the mythology surrounding the making of Exile On Main St. really from the time it came out.
And over the years, especially once
I started recording with them, you know, I asked a lot of questions,
I got a little clearer picture about it but...
The mythology had a huge impact on me in 1972.
Just the little bit of information that came out was kind of life=changing.
The drugs had changed...
That's a major factor in this, OK?
It went from this happy giggle stuff to something else.
And the politics had changed, man.
Nixon was levelling Cambodia and Laos...
It was a weird time.
In '72, I'd just written a paper about Joseph Conrad for class at school.
And then these guys put this album out.
And I'd always looked to them as leaders, you know?
And the message I got was...
"Follow us, we're going the wrong way, against the current, up the river
"and we're gonna be hanging out with Captain Kurtz."
And that was...
And the pictures that filtered through of them recording the album bore that out there, like...
I'd have to go back and see them but my image of it is...
It looked like the prisoners of the POWs in Hanoi, you know?
These real stark black and white things.
And they'd gone off to some distant place, maybe it's like Lord Of The Flies, you know?
Just this... They were not gonna abide by the laws and they were saying,
"Get out while you still can.
The ship's going down."
It was apocalyptic.
It's dark and foreboding but at the same time, it was quite alluring, man.
They were having fun.
And it was totally cool.
It was a scary record.
It was an exraordinary decade, there's no doubting it, and it had to end.
It had to come to an end. Why should we put it on the Rolling Stones that it ended?
It was coming to an end anyway.
I don't mean just because it was changing from 1969 to 1970.
The 60's really ended, I think, in about '73 or '7 4, really.
And so they had to strike out for something new.
And also I guess to search for other ways of telling a story with music, which means all the different influences that they had over the years, right?
I mean, blues, rock, gospel, everything together.
It's a touchstone for a lot of musicians,
I think.
Because there's a unity between how you play and how you live your life in that record, man, you know?
And that's different from other things.
The looseness, the lack of self=consciousness, the confidence...
The confidence towards the world and also in your own playing.
"I'm not gonna get lost,
"don't worry about whether we're speeding up or slowing down."
It's about feel, it's about being in the moment.
It's a Zen record like that, man.
It's all about being in the moment and enjoying the moment.
There's probably not a better example of that out there.
And so, for musicians, it's not just,
"I wanna make music that sounds like that."
It's, "I wanna live my life like that."
Main St. Is downtown LA.
You can't get more main than that, it's real down and out.
I had moved to LA in the early 70's, by '72, I was living in LA.
By '73, I was shooting Mean Streets, some of it in New York, the rest in LA, on Main St.
And it was the down=and=out area.
It was like being on skid row on the Bowery where I grew up, actually, on the Lower East Side, in the old Italian area.
It's a sense of being the outcast, of being on the edge of society, on the fringes I should say, not the edge.
People that don't count.
Supposedly don't count, yet they're still there.
Look at this. I mean, you know...
The incredible photography of Robert Frank.
Also taking in the side show.
The desperation of the side show performer, you know?
And all these elements,
I think, come to play.
And Main Street, you had to know it a little bit.
And also the fact that Main Street is a term that's used for...
How should I put it?
...the white picket fence, small=town Americana, but Main Street in Los Angeles and New York, you know, different place.
They were, I guess...
Maybe they fostered the image of the outcast to a certain exent, and the rebel, obviously.
They all did in rock and roll, all rebels, but these guys were something else.
This was some other existence that led the way.
I think this album was kind of a turning point, kind of a letting go of everything before this record.
And this and Let It Bleed, for me, and Sticky Fingers...
It certainly set me on a course as an artist.
I would say that they probably are the most influential rock artists in my life.
And the record really represents a freedom and a stepping away from the conventional and from the norm.
A freedom in letting go of your surroundings and, as I said, that has a lot to do with...
What happens in your art is leaving all the familiarity behind and bringing your circus on the road with you.
Another thing about this record is that I have never googled the lyrics.
I don't really want to know the actual lyrics.
I am very attached to what I think the songs are about and there are so many words in these songs that I've caught obviously many snippets.
I know basically what's being said but I do not want to know actually what's being said.
Cos it's very powerful.
This is a special record that way and I bet a lot of people feel that way.
They think they know what it's about and they're gonna go to their grave believing that.
I mean, what does it really mean?
It really means...
It really means what's at the core of all the rock stardom, that whole...
Let's face it, at the bottom of a lot of bravado is just basic insecurity and I feel like this record... is a perfect portrait of, like, the essence of what made them rock stars in the first place.
As a kid, growing up,
I imagined the Stones as being absolutely intimidating and raucous and it all being about sex and drugs.
And when you listen to the record, although that may be the environment of the record or the sonic environment of the record, the musicianship on it is seminal, you know?
You had some of the greatest drumming in rock history with Charlie.
And although we think of the Rolling Stones as being... the recordings being steeped in looseness and sort of being a rock and roll shambles, if you will, it's really not.
I mean, it's some of the great,
I think, pop craftsmanship and some of the great rock recording, just as far as the arrangements are concerned, of all time.
And I think that, you know, you get into music now, you listen to some of what's happening and in almost every great rock band, you hear the influence of the Stones.
Exile was the record that really made me go,
"All right, these guys are going to be around forever.
"They're gonna be 95, on the stage, wearing Nikes..."
I've seen you, Mick.
He wears Nikes, that's awesome.
When I came to this...
But I was a freak at that time.
And when I made my record off of their record...
By the way, I met Mick once in LA.
They were, I don't know, doing some record release party which is nex level record release party, like everyone, journalists flew in, you know what I mean?
And he looked at me...
The guy, the producer I was working with, introduced me and said,
"Oh, she made Exile In Guyville."
And he looked at me like he actually forgave me for doing something so awful as to make my record.
And, like, had he known how much I loved this record and that really it became symbolic of a male persona for me.
Like, I actually had a relationship with the guy who is singing all these stories.
And that was my boyfriend and I was either saying, "Oh, please love me", or "You dick!" or whatever I was saying to this guy, this imaginary guy, was what this record meant to me.
It was all the men that I had loved and thought were flamboyant and stood out from the crowd in our rock and roll scene in Chicago, and didn't give me the time of day, or they did, or they toyed with me or whatever it was,
I was deep in a personal relationship with this record.
And I was not critiquing it.
I was yelling at my imaginary boyfriend.
Nobody really ever asked me about Exile On Main St. when I was making or when I came out with
Exile In Guyville, except to say, "Is it really a song by song response? Because I don't hear it."
And, frankly, I think that's just sexism because you'd have to be a girl to understand what I was doing.
Men would be like,
"Well, you have no horns."
You know? "There's no brass."
You know? They just didn't get it.
See, I'm not sure what prompted the decision.
But I just got a call from Mick, early in 2009, saying, "We're thinking of reissuing Exile
"with a few exra previously unreleased tracks.
"Would you be interested?"
"Yeah, OK."
So, nex thing I know...
I got the equivalent of 200 boxes of tape, maybe more.
It was all on hard drives at this point.
When I first started on the thing,
I got a fax from Keith. A stern one.
Saying, "Don't try to make it sound like Exile. It already is Exile."
And that was very wise and he was absolutely right.
The task was to not get in the way of it.
Don't fix it up.
You know, it really is archival, as much as anything.
Part of the consideration was...
Don't just put out the same stuff that's been bootlegged to death if you're gonna add something new to it.
And let's try to find those gems, like Sophia Loren, that no one has heard.
Like, no one's heard, that's never been bootlegged. That was a joy.
Aladdin Story, which has been heard and covered by Death In Vegas.
I don't know if you ever...
It's amazing...
They did a recording of it, and very faithful, too.
But no one's ever heard it with the vocal.
So that's something that's cool.
It was really... to try to make something interesting for people, something that would hold together.
We were really just looking for three or four tracks.
We ended up finishing 1 1, and to be honest with you, there's more there.
And it'd already been pillaged, too, for Tattoo You and for Goats Head Soup.
And there's a lot of great stuff to be left off because it didn't fall into that period.
The lines between when Exile begins and where Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers end, it's a little grey.
So some of the reels that might have had something relevant to Exile also had other stuff.
The first thing I put on, it said
Honky Tonk Women and I was, "What"?
So, I put that reel on first and...
It was the nine takes leading up to the final take of Honky Tonk Women.
And they should just put that out.
You can chart the thing...
It starts with Country Honk and they took that as far as they could and that wasn't where it was supposed to go, and I think nex day they start over and lan Stewart's playing honky=tonk piano.
And Keith's playing in the holes of this thing that's filling up all the air.
And somewhere around take nine, they pull the piano out and you got this angular rhythmic thing that he's doing, which makes total sense if you hear the piano, but when you first heard that, it was like, "Wow!"
How does anyone...
I've never heard anything like that, like the beginning of Honky Tonk Women.
From that tuning just to the angular rhythm of it.
So, it's a very interesting trip.
But there was all kinds of stuff.
Although I do believe that the take of Loving Cup that's on the bonus tracks is...
That's my favourite thing, to be honest with you. It's...
It represents...
When we talk about having loose rock and roll without it being sloppy, how far from the centre of gravity can each individual pull the thing and still keep the centrifugal force going...
This version of Loving Cup absolutely takes it to the limits and it's fantastic, man.
It's just... And Mick's vocal on it.
It's just such an attitude, you know?
Like it just requires a guy of that age who does whatever he wants to do to sing with that attitude.
And it's so...
I think that really captures the spirit of this.
I love that track.
And it's different.
It's guitarcentric as opposed to being pianocentric.
It's not a gospel song, which it is on this.
But outside of the choice of takes on that, they did the right thing here.
I think it's just fun.
Fun to listen to.
You've heard all the Beatles stuff and you've heard a whole lot of the Dylan stuff.
And, you know,
I don't think there are too many people that mean that much to you, where the sound has emotional triggers that transcend the notes.
That's the thing about the Stones.
When you hear that five=string tuning when Keith plays that, or when you hear Mick's voice, or even when you hear Charlie lifting up off the high hat on the two and the four like nobody else does... When you hear those things, whether the Rolling Stones like it or not, it's got all sorts of emotional triggers for people that transcend the records.
So that's an essential component of this.
It took years and, ultimately, it took playing music with the Rolling Stones, actually playing bass with them just during sessions and between songs and everything like that, to understand what goes on in that band.
The Rolling Stones really listen to each other.
They're quick to react, as they are in conversation.
It's a highly conversational band.
The exchange, musically, between the players is...
...it's jocular and it's loose and it's quick.
And just as their conversational repartee is like that, so is their playing.
And whatever goes on interpersonally between any of them,
I believe it evaporates when they start playing.
And they're loose.
It reminds me so much of Miles Davis.
Miles Davis was the jazz example.
That band that he had around that same time, that had Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter and Ron Carter and Tony Williams, was loose, was floating on this incredible drum thing that's happening, and confident and a little cocky.
It's the way you should play rock and roll.
Without self=consciousness, without being stiff, without showing off.
It's not a show=off record.
It's not filled with "look how fast I can play".
It's a really soulful record.
You can't overstate the importance of Mick Taylor.
That's something else I learned from listening to this stuff.
He's a great foil for Keith's playing.
It's different from what he's got going with Ronnie, where they talk about the weaving of the guitarists.
This is two very separate approaches that bounce off each other in a really unique way.
It's a real strong characteristic of the Stones' recordings from that period.
Something else that I really got hip to was just how great a bass player
Bill Wyman is.
He's a crazy, genius bass player.
I'm a bass player,
I can learn his parts note for note, but I could never come up with them.
He sort of thinks like a guitar player and he's playing in holes where a guitar player might play with a very melodic kind of thing and the tone of the bass doesn't have a big low register, it's almost nasally sounding, it's almost like it's the seventh string of the guitar.
But then, he'll throw in some James Jameson kind of thing, some totally funky fill that's just like...
It's quite sophisticated.
He's an enigmatic musician... but such an important component in this stuff.
If there's one thing, one big overall thing, that I learned about Exile from listening to all this stuff... it's that maybe everything that you heard about actually happened, but when they were recording... they were on their game.
You couldn't possibly write all these songs and record all these songs and play them as well as they did, and not be at the top of your game.
So, the mythology's got to include some superhuman strength and has got to acknowledge that they're really professional, they're really a great band.
There's nothing shitty about Exile On Main St.
When you really get into it, there's a looseness but that should not be mistaken for sloppiness.
There's nothing sloppy about Exile.
And there's a lot of really good stuff.
Plus, in the things that weren't included on the album, you can see the link, you can see the link to...
Like Aladdin Story, for example, which is called something else now...
That's the link to Between The Buttons and Exile. But there is one.
So, a lot of these things...
In fact, if you just listen to these 18 songs, it's like "Wow, where did that spring from?"
But there actually is some lineage and connection.
Mick and l, sometimes, just before we start making an album, say, "What kind of album do we want to make?"
And I say, "Make a Rolling Stones album."
That's about as far as I can narrow it down.
It's really a matter of surprising yourself, it's about what's coming out.
If I knew everything that was to be played it would probably sound as dead as a doornail, you know.
You kind of tend to write songs no matter what else you're doing.
It's not one of those things where you sit down and say,
"Songwriting time."
It's just something that happens during the day.
You might pick up a guitar to tune it, and before you know it you've got a song.
If you're lucky.
I never pushed songwriting.
It's a...
Idea comes in.
Like an antenna.
You know, "Incoming, transmit."
Albums, what you get, you say, "That's that album," a lot of albums roll over into the nex one.
Some of the stuff that you do...
And, say, Sticky Fingers, towards the end you've got more stuff than you can use, you say, "We'll just save it."
So you kind of roll over material that way, and the album becomes what gets on there, but to us the process is continual, usually.
But it's, "Let's use these 12 songs, and what do we call it?"
"I know, Beggars Banquet.
I know, Let It Bleed, Exile On Main St."
So you kind of take snippets of something that's going on all the time.
Still is.
On a good day I can still write a song.
It interested me, and I think probably the other guys, of actually not recording in a recording studio = that was a novelty.
Because before then, you always thought...
"To make a record you've got to go in the studio."
This kind of if you've broken a leg you've got to go to hospital.
We found out you could break legs just as simply and easily without bothering, that you could actually make an environment that you could work with.
I think we first thought it would be a bit of an experiment and then we'd move on to another studio.
But by the time we'd got settled in and things were starting to happen, it was just, "Why bother?
We've got what we want here."
So it was a matter of experiments, a lot of that.
I mean, getting lost in those damn basements... It was enormous.
So you could say, "Let's try the drums in that one for this song
"because it's got more echo, more snap."
Or you put the bass in another room.
You could experiment with the place like that, find the best spot for each instrument.
It's got a kind of very dense sound, that you can pretty much tell that it was recorded there.
I'd say the beginning, the first month, was probably a little bit touch and go whether we'd actually pull it off, but then it started to flow, and as I say, we said, "We don't need to go anywhere else, we can do it all here."
And I said,
"Great. In that case, I'll stay. I'll unpack."
I think we always wanted to be a bit of a soul band as well, and horns... they were...
I wouldn't have said...
Maybe it was because it was Bobby and Jim Price, it was just the two cats, it wasn't like a whole full horn section which can be a lot to take care of.
With just the two guys, they fit into the size of the band real well.
It just gave us that exra texure that we'd been looking for.
So we basically just were a bit of a soul band, in a way, at that time.
Bobby and I were working together for a couple of years before we realized that... actually born on the same day, same everything, within hours of each other.
I said, "The only problem with Bobby is that he's a Texan.
"Otherwise he's great."
We'd never even intended it to be a double album until finally we'd sort of run out of songs and said,
"Wow, there's too much for one album
"but there's too much good stuff.
"We can't cut this baby up."
So we decided to go for the double.
Sometimes it's the hardest part of making albums = what order do the songs come in?
And you kind of get used to listening to them, jumbling them up, and saying, "That one works nice off of that," and you kind of work it like that.
It's a bit like a jigsaw puzzle.
Sometimes you have a good track but it doesn't somehow work coming out of that track or going into that.
And of course there's always the thing that somebody else has a different feeling about it, and so you've got to...
"Well, do we flip a coin or what?"
But it's quite a process.
We were successful, I suppose, in that respect, that it hangs together well.
That's an important thing with a record.
You can have the same record, the same songs, but if they're in a sort of order that sometimes can jar and not quite hang together.
And that's the difficult thing = you've made a great record and you know it's good stuff, but will it hang together?
With Exile I think we did it.
It's just having, I think, maybe the exra amount of space to play with.
You know, more songs, more time.
Firstly it was received with a little bit of doubt and scepticism, but then it just started to pick up and then it kept going and going and going until some people now say,
"It's the best album you've ever done."
I don't know about that, but I'm still very proud of it.
I can never pick...
I mean, what do I think's the best?
I could never think in those terms.
It's just, "Well, that was what was the best of what I did then."
You're kind of used to seeing us chopping and changing in this life, but yeah, we'd also been off the road for quite a while, and quite honestly we had to get used to how things had changed in the about two years that we were off.
Technology had changed immensely.
I mean, they actually...
You had PAs, which sounds weird now, but when we used to work in the '60s... most PAs were a couple of little speakers hung on a side of a wall, one of which usually worked, and that was just for the vocal.
So we had to get into learning miking up, monitors, so we had to do a lot of catch=up to start with.
It didn't take long, but it's a lot more to consider.
Before, you just went on stage and hoped they heard you. That was it.
It was kind of exciting to go to Cannes and walk along the beach and see all the topless girls, which you didn't see in England, and naked girls and all that.
That was a bit of fun.
And just getting into that, and then, much later, meeting... famous artists, painters.
I did, anyway. I don't know about the others, they left earlier.
It was...
And living in a really nice house.
I lived in a place called the Bastide de Saint Antoine which was near Grasse where they do the perfume.
And...
I had these beautiful gardens with high wild flowers and all that, and they had their own vineyards and they used to have their own wine.
Used to have about 400 or 600 bottles of wine every year from their grapes, which you drank, it was the house wine.
And I would go in the gardens and I could just take photos of nature and see massive great grass snakes about seven foot long.
And it was really, really interesting.
I've always loved nature anyway.
And I did a lot of movie films of a praying mantis eating insects and things.
I just enjoyed all that.
But then, when it came to recording, when they finally got the Stones' mobile studio over to Keith's house, very convenient for Keith, wasn't it?
There was this stairway that came down from upstairs, and it turned, at the bottom of the stairway it turned, and there was a room.
It was probably nine foot square, maybe ten.
That was where we recorded.
And it used to get so hot in there that condensation used to run down the walls and all that.
My bass amp used to be under the bloody stairs, out round there.
The horn players used to be down the corridor in the kitchen, when they were doing things, or vocals.
It was all spread.
We couldn't see the engineer and he couldn't see us = Andy Johns, and Jimmy Miller the producer.
They couldn't see us, we didn't have a contact with them.
So it was always speaking.
And it was just like an oven.
It was not very conducive to making music, really, and it was a bloody miracle we did.
I suppose we had the band there, the whole band there, probably 30%, 40% of the time.
The rest of the time it was just bits.
Me and Charlie, and...
Mick hadn't come, Mick Taylor didn't come, me, Charlie and Keith, so we'd work on something.
Nex day Keith wouldn't come because Mick wasn't there so then Mick'd come and then he'd see Keith wasn't there so the nex day he wouldn't come.
And sometimes we'd all get there to do a session and Keith wouldn't even come, he was upstairs sleeping, and we'd...
Charlie had come five hours, me and Mick Taylor had come two hours,
Mick had come an hour, and Keith's upstairs, and he didn't come down to the session.
It was like madness.
Musically, he was a better musician than any of us in the band, definitely.
He was young, he was...
God, some of the things he did were... just amazing.
He was incredibly boring on the stage.
He'd just stand there and look at his guitar and just do these most amazing licks and riffs and solos, but he'd just... like that, you know.
God, the audience would see the top of his head all the time.
And I always thought he could have been a bit more... to the public...
But then I'm not a good one to talk, am I?
I don't leap about much.
In 30 years with the Stones I've probably made three steps on the stage.
By the time it gets to that stage it's quite different from the way it starts, and you've got names of songs, and you think... and you think,
"Tumbling Dice? Which one's that?"
And then you hear it and you say, "Oh, yeah,
"that's the track we called so=and=so, that had a different name."
And Keith used to think of funny names.
He'd call one, like...
General Election or something, you know.
And it'd turn out to be
All Down The Line or...
So when you saw the list of the tracks on the album, what were going on, you didn't know which one was which, cos you didn't know them by those titles.
Cos Mick wrote the lyrics much later, often, we did the tracks, and then he did the lyrics later and put them on.
You'd heard them so many times that they were just like... you didn't really want to listen to them for a while.
And Charlie's the same.
He says, "I don't listen to it.
Once you get the album, I don't listen to it."
I'll say, "I don't either."
I don't put the record on.
When you get the record,
I don't put it on my turntable and listen to it.
Keith does. Keith'd put it on and play it for the nex three weeks solid, every night, morning, noon and night, at full volume.
And he does that, bless him, that's what he does.
We went back to our roots with Beggars Banquet and then we just continued in that way.
I don't see a lot different on Exile On Main St. from the two albums before it or the one after it, actually, Let It Bleed.
They're all my favourite albums, those four albums are my favourites, of all the career.
I think that's when we were at our peak musically, inventively, creatively, and on stage we were dynamite.
No one could come near us on stage, no one.
That whole period was incredibly intense and creative for all of us because it was a new beginning for the band and they'd signed a new contract with Atlantic Records and we had to, in theory at least, we had to come up with at least six albums in six years.
If we weren't hanging out together or recording... we were touring.
I just remember most of the time we were either in the studio or we were socialising together or we were on the road.
The enduring thing about being with the Stones, right from the very beginning, actually,
I mean, right from when I first joined them,
I'd be going over to
Mick's house in Cheyne Walk and he'd be playing old blues records.
Same with Keith.
It always had this underlying... sort of rootsy blues feel, which was what really... you know, made it so special.
I think it was a real struggle for Keith and Anita once we started the recording process, because you're mixing domesticity, in a way, with... not to put too grand a term, art.
Domesticity and art don't necessarily mix.
Although we were recording down in a basement that was separate from what was going on above...
There were constant power failures, and...
Compared to the way records are made today, it was quite primitive and quite basic.
You know, I remember Mick having to sing using... having to use a different part of the basement, maybe a disused toilet, or something, to do his vocal overdubs in.
They basically had to turn it into their home, and of course... it ended up being like a holiday resort for all their friends and everybody else's friends.
And in the midst of all this holidaying and partying we were trying to make an album.
In those days all the other girls were, like, very kind of... not middle class, but kind of very quiet and wanted to have a baby and wanted to get married and all of that, and I...
For me it was not on the agenda.
I just wanted to live out the dream.
That place was just amazing, it was just exraordinary, it was very decadent.
And it belonged to an admiral called Alexandre Bardes or Bordes, and he was an admiral, an English admiral, and he collected exotic plants.
And so from every trip that he went he brought these plants home and he just filled up the garden with all these monkey trees, baobab,
I mean, it was like a jungle.
There were places where I wouldn't even go.
And the whole house was like... it was majestic and very big, very, very kind of decaying.
No furniture =
I remember bringing some rugs.
They're in all the photographs of Dominique Tarle.
I say, "Oh, that rug..."
We brought along the rugs. So we kind of lived in that kind of style anyway, rock'n'roll, hippy, whatever, all on the floor basically.
Everybody that came there, they were shocked.
You know, they said,
"How can a beautiful place
"have all these toys on the floor and silly guitars..."
The best places were for the guitars = all the nice couches and everything, all guitars.
You always had to sit somewhere...
I mean, Keith still does that, he's always got the guitar in the best place, his best seat.
It was great. They all took part.
I don't know, in the evening we put them to sleep, and that's it.
I don't know how you could sleep with all that noise, but kids are kids, so...
And then they had a great attitude towards the grown=ups as well, and the grown=ups had to deal with them as well, especially Jake and Charley who were older than Marlon,
Marlon was still a toddler, two years old.
But the other ones were always very demanding and kind of confronting them and playing with them.
No, it was really good, a good vibe.
Lunch was always outside, and dinner was always...
I remember running in the kitchen, like, all the time.
"We need more of that, more of that..."
It was really...
I don't know who paid for it, but I'm sure it cost a bomb.
And all the wines and all of that, and we always had liquor in the house.
It was like a freeloading kind of brigade, basically.
And some of them were really annoying, and I got more and more bored with all these people and I became a bouncer.
I kind of remember standing at the top of the stairs and just throwing... emptying a room out that somebody had slept in and just throwing all these clothes down.
And everybody was like, "She's a monster!"
That's what I ended up doing, just throwing everybody out.
Then I started to move around rooms, and for a period I moved into a room just above the truck.
But that was also part of our escape route in case we got busted.
We had this escape route that we planned so you could jump out the window where I was sleeping, and then jump on the bus and get out really quickly, because otherwise it was all these corridors and staircases.
So we had it all sussed, we had it pretty sussed.
It was really incredible, yachts... it was, like, the deepest harbour in the Mediterranean, and then there was the Sixh Fleet, the Germans were there, all the navy people were there.
The Sixh Fleet would come in, they'd have LSD, and all the village would open and all these people would ravage the village, and shoot=outs, and it was like a...
Yeah, it was like a frontier, like being in the Far West.
All these sailors, like, running around.
That was more interesting than what was going on in the house for us.
So we used to go up and drive up to them and pretend to be pirates and do all kinds of nonsense.
A couple of them had skull and bones flags as well, so there was, like, this element of bonding with these people, but they didn't think so.
And then, I mean, Keith, he drove out with his motorboat, and then he ran out of gasoline so then he sent flares and we had to go to Villefranche and pick him up.
But that happened a lot.
When you live with them, that's what you see. You don't see... all the other people from the outside see...
It's a kind of reality that you live with.
And I've always found it really sad that people always say,
"It was all sex and drugs and rock'n'roll."
It was rock'n'roll and drugs and sex, in that order.
When it came out, yes,
I was really proud of them.
I was really proud of Keith as well.
I loved it right away, from Rip This Joint all the way down.
It's amazing, it really is special.
I actually went to France and bought a house and set up home there.
Everybody else rented a place or something.
And I chose somewhere, typically me, right in the middle of sort of North Wales, the equivalent thereof.
So it was miles from anywhere, right in the mountains, so...
But I still have it.
It was an old = well, old = it was an Edwardian villa, beautiful thing.
Keith had this fabulous balcony that he overlooked the end of the thing...
Where was it, Nellcote?
At the Cap Ferrat or something.
Good sound in the cellar, it was a huge cellar.
It wasn't a little place.
I think I was in the sort of coal bunker bit, but it was a good sound for the drums, the drums were great.
Time to Keith was a very loose thing.
It was a very small T=l=M=E because it meant...
He's like it even now he's straight.
Keith's time is...
I don't mean his playing time but his time of getting up and going...
It's quite normal for Keith to work from sort of eight in the evening till three o'clock the nex afternoon.
And Mick works from eight at night till twelve at night, and goes home.
So as a drummer you're in the middle of doing it all.
That's why it was good at Nellcote, cos you could do that.
Didn't matter when I went to bed.
No, I'm serious. Keith works like that.
Anyway, and with various other things going on, you might not work for two days and then do a whole two days without sleep the nex.
Keith likes to do a good track, keep it, and play it over and over again, for at least a year.
He likes that.
Mick and I tend to do it and hear it back and never play it again ever.
And Mick will just hear it when he mixes it and that's it.
Keith will play them endlessly.
That's why Keith's a good one to... if you ask him about a track you did two years ago, he'll have it on his thing and know...
If it's a good one he'll know it and play it.
It's very good...
What I meant about him being a jazz player is he plays like that, his playing is... it's very easy playing with Keith.
Very easy.
Your only critic is yourself, really.
He doesn't say, "Ooh, that's horrible."
And he doesn't stop playing if whatever.
It's like, "If that's how you want to do it, see what happens.
"I didn't like it, but you liked it."
He's very easy like that, very easy to play with.
And if it's good he's very complimentary about it.
So he's very easy to play with.
Well, it's a long time I've played with him.
Very comfortable to play with.
What I think happened with Exile is that we had all these odd things going, and the songs that were done for the albums that we used... so we had these other things that were actually... like Casino Boogie and all those things, normally they're pushed, not used, but they'd slowly come to the surface and we needed them to do this thing and they...
That's how...
And sometimes you miss the best things.
You do, no matter who you are.
Mick won't like using something from two days ago, so you'll miss it.
Not his fault, it's just how it evolves.
And sometimes you have an idea of an album, that it should all be this, and so you dismiss the other stuff.
And that's kind of what happened with Exile.
We picked up a lot of stuff that was dismissed off the albums before, couple of albums.
They always say that about great writers.
"All great writers are alcoholics."
And you go, "No, they're not."
And you look at them and you think,
"Bloody hell, the great ones actually were!"
Mostly.
Fitzgerald, all that lot.
It's like, "Whoa, wait a minute."
So maybe that's true. I don't know.
That's been said about jazz musicians for years.
I was going to ask that as well...
Now, you could be right.
How many people copied Charlie Parker cos he was so great and so fucked up at the same time?
Many people.
But I don't think it made him greater than he actually was.
It may have made him spend more time on it, I don't know, cos that's what it does, it messes your...
I don't know, actually, about that one.
And also when you're younger you can cope with it.
It's when you're older you can't.
And it doesn't hang on you so well either.
I remember hanging out with the Stones in the Olympic, when I first met them with the Faces, the Small Faces, when I used to hang out with them.
They sang...
...the background vocals to
Get Off My Cloud, things like that.
Many good memories of parties, cos Olympic used to have three different studios.
You'd have the Faces in one, the Stones in another,
David Bowie in another.
Everyone would meet in the canteen, like, "How's it going? All right?"
I remember, yeah, it was a really big moment in my life.
Like, "The Stones have to leave England!"
Yeah.
And then I got hit by the taxman as well.
So was the government starting to come after the big rich rock stars?
I got hit for 80 grand or something, which meant me having to leave England, and I went, "Now I understand what Exile was all about."
Because, just like the general public, it took them years to find out how good the album was.
When it first came out as a double album, it was great to me, but really... not understandable by the general public.
It was like, "Double album?
"These guys really think they can do a double album?"
I mean, it's twice as many songs.
They were all fantastic.
I was born with those songs in my mouth, anyway.
You can name any song off of there and I was with it.
I didn't have to learn it.
When I joined the band, back in '7 4 or whenever, when I had to learn
160 songs or something, that was my initiation down in Woodstock...
I ended up teaching them to the band.
I knew the songs. I'd never played them before but I just knew them.
Well, Mick will be a fusspot because he always is, to today.
He's mixing, he's remixing Exile now.
So that shows you.
It's never quite... perfect enough.
In his view.
But to my view... it's different.
It hits the nail on the head whether the tracks are mixed or not.

- Would you welcome
Miss Joan Rivers.
You know, you're going to be a big star.
- Now here is my daffy little friend, Joan Rivers.
Aah!
Joan Rivers, the groundbreaking female comedian, paves the way for women everywhere.
- You know how I know who's gay and who's not gay?
Can we talk here?
And the Emmy goes to...
Joan Rivers.
Here's Joan Rivers!
Yes, but I'm very, very late.
- I hope you've had a few drinks,
'cause you're gonna need 'em.
Will you welcome, please,
Miss Joan Rivers!
This is my career.
I mean, how depressing is this?
40 years in the fucking business, and this is where you end up.
Just to show you...
My daughter and I are very close, very, very close, very close.
But I brought her up all wrong.
I brought her up to have morals.
She turned down doing Playboy magazine cover.
How about that?
$400,000 naked to the waist.
Turned it fucking down and calls me up for approval.
For approval!
"Mother,
I've turned down Playboy.
What do you think?"
And you know-
What do I think?
"Oh, I'm very proud of you,
Melissa.
"What do I think?
"What do I think, you stupid fucking cunt?
"What do I think?
"I think you should ask for $200,000 more
"and show your pussy.
That's what I think."
I'm a 75-year-old woman up here playing to drunks in Queens.
What do I think?
I'm on the fucking red carpet in the hot sun, talking to these assholes.
"Where you from?
"Got your lucky charm?
Who the fuck are you?"
Not good.
I mean, this is not good.
We have no Vegas, no giant club dates.
Kathy Griffin has taken all of those away.
Uh, I have the play, which is not going to bring me any money.
Can't we get club dates?
Can't Billy get club dates?
This is not a full book.
- Like a little date here and there?
- Yeah
- Sure.
These were the good years.
- These were the good years.
- See, this is the kind of a book I like.
Now, that's a good page, you know what I mean.
These are good pages.
This and that.
That's happiness.
Last year was a very difficult year.
I was playing-here we go-
The Bronx at 4:30 in the afternoon.
That was a real... good one.
I'll show you fear.
That's fear.
If my book ever looked like this, it would mean that nobody wants me and that everything I ever tried to do in life didn't work and nobody cared and I've been totally forgotten.
- When you say,
"Joan, get out your calendar," she goes, "Hold on, let me put my sunglasses on, because the white of the page hurts my eyes."
So that's a joke.
So we used to laugh about it.
She goes, "Hold on.
Let me get my sunglasses.
Okay, what day?"
You look handsome.
Yeah, right.
- Billy looks good.
He can't stand it.
I can't.
- Why not?
- My career is in the toilet.
Oh, no, that's Joan.
That's me.
My career is in the toilet.
Nothing is going right.
- That's right.
- Nothing.
Why?
- I don't know.
It's like, you know...
That's what I always tell him.
Unless Joan gives me...
- Billy Sammeth is a big part of my life,
huge part of my life.
He knows my history.
You know, there are so few people
that you can say, "Do you remember Bernie Brillstein?"
And we both laugh and laugh and laugh.
Joan is a chronic workaholic.
One job a day is not enough.
It's almost like an addict, sadly, but she's a work addict, so it's not enough.
No matter how much you give her, it doesn't fill up that need to be working.
Now, this is Jocelyn Pickett.
This is my assistant, who is now going to show you how busy I am.
Anybody call?
- No.
- No.
- It's not about whether the talent is good.
It's about whether they're hot.
There are times in people's career that you just can't get it going.
Careers do that.
You're hot,; you're not.
You're in a slump,; you're not.
Nothing is happening right now, so she needs some heat.
Steve Levine's office.
Jennifer Moen?
Hi, Billy Sammeth.
And Joan Rivers.
- Hi, Joan Rivers.
Hold on just a moment.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
- Let's hear about Harrah's, which is May 18th.
This is the weekend before Memorial Day.
I just think it's wrong.
It's not vacation.
The kids are still in school.
I want a letter from them saying,
"We acknowledge this is the worst weekend, one of the worst weekends of the year."
Okay.
- And I really don't need, at this age, when I am a comedy icon,
I don't need to walk into a room and have it half full, and then have the Harrah's people go,
"Cluck, cluck, cluck."
- Right now, they see her as a plastic surgery freak
who's past due.
Her, you know, sell-by date, was finished.
But God help the next queen of comedy,
because this one's not abdicating.
Never will.
There will be nail marks on that red carpet before she abdicates, so good luck to the next queen.
# Happy birthday to you #
All right, all right.
Don't sing.
Age.; it's the one mountain that you can't overcome.
It's a youth society, and nobody wants you.
You're too old.
You're too old.
You're too old.
If one more woman comedian comes up and says to me,
"You opened the doors for me,"
and you want to say,
"Go fuck yourself."
I'm still opening the doors.
That's great.
You're very welcome.
Thank you very much.
- You are a Barnard College graduate?
Yes.
- And your father is a doctor?
- Yes.
- And you live where, in Scarsdale?
- In Larchmont.
- In Larchmont.
And your mother is a...
- A mother.
- Just a mother.
- But how do they look upon this, what you're doing, what it is you do?
- Frightened.
- Are they?
- Well, now they're very showbiz.
And my mother and I are thinking of doing a sister act.
But, um, still, uh...
- The audience here really liked you, and, uh, good luck to you.
Good night.
- Thanks, Jack.
Good night.
Good night.
Joan, here's the script for the TV pilot you wanted to look at.
Okay.
Thank you.
Do you know where I am in this?
I see no Joan on page two.
I see no Joan on page three.
I see no Joan on page four.
- I have worked with her for about 15 years, I think, somewhere in there, so I definitely have gone through kind of the ups and downs, you know, with her, with her career.
When I started,
it was definitely kind of a lower point.
Her daytime talk show was cancelled.
At the same time, her play Sally Mar,
which ran on Broadway, that shut down.
Everything was kind of closing, you know, at that point.
So, of course, Joan being Joan, then started to try and reinvent herself.
No.
I ain't seeing me.
This year is no different.
Joan is looking at new projects,
new ways to get out there.
And she's got two new books coming out,
a new play that she's really worked on very hard
for the past couple of years.
And Celebrity Apprentice- she's booked to be on the next series
of Celebrity Apprentice.
So she's hoping one of them hits and puts her back on top.
I can't find me anywhere.
What we are planning is...
The cutoff date for the Emm- for the Tony nominations is somewhere in April, so we have to open somewhere in April.
For the next few months,
I am really focusing just on my play.
It means a great deal to me because it tells my life story.
- So she calls me up one night, and she goes,
"Billy, it's Joan.
"Listen, I wrote a script a couple years ago.
It's in the drawer."
Now, I actually saw a reading of it a year earlier,
and I enjoyed it.
So I said,
"I think you should do it."
Hi, Joanie.
Hi, Billy Boy.
- Hi, Billy.
- This is Billy.
Hi, Seany.
I'm a little schvitzy.
- Schwitzy?
How you doing?
- Schvit.
- Schvit.
- Schvit.
- Schvit.
- Schvitzy.
- Schvitzy, schvitzy.
The name of the show is
A Work in Progress by a Life in Progress, you know, episodes from her life, how she got to where she is now.
We're going to take this to the Edinburgh Festival,
and then we're going to do it
in London's glittering West End.
The ultimate goal?
I think Joan wants to play it in her hometown.
- "I have very few hairs left on my head,
"and each one has a name, like last week, we had to sit shiva for Bernice," or, "We buried Bernice," or, "We cremated Bernice."
- Yeah, "cremated"
I think is good.
- I hope that the play is a huge success.
I think the play will remind them
I'm an actress.
I'm a writer.
And if we get great reviews, it will open up a million other things.
"One of my earliest memories,
I must have been,
"tops, six years old.
"My mother took me to see
Paul Robeson in Othello,
"and I remember smelling the smells of the theater, and I thought,
'This is where I belong."'
I was in every school play.
I was in everything you could do at college.
There was never a discussion in my own head
of where I was going, and it was always acting.
Always going to be an actress.
- Were you-were you-you were straight acting or comedy?
No, no, comedy, never.
I just knew that I could work as a comedian at night
and make money to make the rounds as an actress.
And that's the only reason
I went into comedy.
Sometimes I sit at home, and I think to myself,
"Joan, yes, you're a diva.
You're a diva.
"Penthouse, limo, furs.
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff."
But a diva can get lonely.
And I say this to my staff,
I say, "Staff..."
I don't know any of their names, because they're like you people.
They come.
They go.
Sometimes I say to them,
"Staff, I'm lonely.
Who's going to fuck me tonight, staff?"
Oh!
That's their reaction.
Yes, yes, yes.
This is delicious, huh?
This is Kevin, who runs my house, also without asking me anything.
Thank God.
That is Debbie, his wife, over there, who really is the brains behind Kevin.
We thought you should know.
It's true.
It's bacon, you idiot.
This is my apartment, and it's very grand.
This is how Marie Antoinette would have lived if she had had money.
- You try to explain to people before you go to her house,
"What you're about to see, nobody lives like this.
"Maybe the queen of England, but besides that, nobody lives like this."
- I live very, very, very well.
That's to start with.
I enjoy my creature comforts.
And I know I have to work for it.
I could stop and live carefully, but that's ridiculous.
I don't want to live carefully.
So I would rather work and live the way I live and have a wonderful time.
- When I hear the numbers from her accountant, because, you know, behind our client's back, everyone's whispering.
So they called me, and they said,
"Billy, you've got to pull another rabbit out of the hat."
"How many rabbits would you like out of the hat?
I don't have that many more rabbits in my hat."
- When I first hit on the Carson show years ago, my manager then was a man named Jack Rollins, and he said, "You're going to be an industry.
When people hit, they become industries."
And that's really what-
I'm a small industry.
- This week's checks for you to sign.
- Oh, good.
Okay.
I have an agent.
I have a manager.
I have a business manager, a PR lady,
two assistants, and a lawyer.
We forget the lawyers.
There are then certain relatives
that I'm totally supporting,
certain friends.
Most people that work with me, if they have children,
I send the children to private schools.
It goes on and on and on and on.
I'm dancing as fast as I can.
Are you on speaker?
- Okay.
So where do we start?
- Yeah, I would love to, because I'm very short on money.
Trust me, we need it.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay, okay.
- Bump up the offer, and you'll do your comedy.
- Yeah, bump up the offer and they get one- bump up the offer, and they get Joan on stage.
Bump up the offer some more, and they get Joan doing a survival lecture and onstage.
Mm-hmm.
Bump up the offer some more, and they also get the red carpet lecture, the survival lecture.
- And don't forget there's the 125 grand worth of charm!
Just...
You know the dates we're holding for QVC, right, Billy, pretty much?
- Yeah.
- Let me ask you one last thing.
Do you think it's in bad taste to say about Obama's wife, who I think is so chic,
Michelle, that she is-your remember we- in the old days, in the Kennedy era, there was Jackie O?
Well, now, in the Obama era, it's going to be Blackie O.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- Okay, just-I thought it was a great joke, okay.
These are all my jokes.
These are jokes over the last 30 years.
These are just- every time I write a joke,
I try to remember to get it on a card.
"Why should a woman cook?
"So her husband can say,
"'My wife makes a delicious cake,' to some hooker."
And you wonder why I'm still working at this age.
People think it comes so easily.
They have no idea that what you're doing
is a terrifically difficult thing to do.
And I prepare like a crazy lady.
I mean, here I am.
I mean, everything is just...
Everywhere you look, there are jokes.
Everywhere-jokes to be filed, jokes to be written, jokes that I thought of something.
I mean, my life is just... jokes.
"Vagina farts.
My vagina farts are so loud, my gynecologist wears earplugs."
"Are gay men proud of their excessive body hair, like Madonna's daughter?"
Maybe.
"Amazing Race.;
Mel Gibson chasing Jews into the showers."
As some of you can tell now,
I'm seven and a half months pregnant.
And you want to know the truth?
You know how lousy you feel at night?
When I'm undressed, my husband looks at me and mentally dresses me.
You know how cruel that can be?
When I started comedy,
I was very wild for the time, but different times.
The last line in my original act was,
"This business, it's all about casting couches,
"so I want you to know, my name is Joan Rivers, and I put out."
And you would hear the audience- such a sweet little, silly line from a girl who was, what, 28 years old, you know, dressed up, trying to look nice.
The audience, half of them laughed.
Jack Lemmon saw me and walked out.
He said, "That's disgusting."
So for my time,
I was very shocking.
I remember I had a joke about abortions
when you weren't supposed to
even say the word on television.
I have a friend who just got married.
The woman is 32 years old.
She had 14 appendectomies, if you know what I'm telling you.
You know, back and forth to Puerto Rico.
She never stopped flying.
She walked down the aisle in white.
Every usher went...
My manager took me out and said to me,
"Joanala, you're going into places you shouldn't go.
"It's not right.
It's not right.
A woman shouldn't talk about that."
I remember thinking,
"You are so wrong.
This is exactly what we should be talking about."
My daughter loves me very, very much.
I was there when she gave birth.
Ugch! Oh!
In California, they bring the parents in now to see the birt-
Ugh, ugh, ugh.
In my day, having a child was better.
They knocked you out with the first pain.
They woke you up when the hairdresser showed.
You knew nothing.
It was so much better.
"Miss Rivers, you had a girl."
"Good, good, good."
"Is she normal?"
"Yeah."
"Good, good."
"Is she white?"
"Yeah."
"Good."
"The marriage continues."
- I went to see her live one time.
The shit that came out of her mouth was so shocking and so funny.
She was doing something that no other woman was doing.
You know, I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for Joan,
much in the way that she acknowledges that Phyllis Diller paved the way for her and before her was Moms Mabely, and-get it.
There's a handful of women in modern history that have done this.
Just a handful.
I was so angry...
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
While we're on the subject, let me talk to you about sex over 60.
After 60, the body drops.
The body drops.
Yeah.
And it's not just the breasts.
Vaginas drop.
Vaginas drop.
Um, six years ago, I woke up one morning, and I said,
"Why am I wearing a bunny slipper?
And why is it gray?"
Brilliant.
- I went to the dermatologist, so please excuse the way I look.
- I got a shot filled with everything, and I said,
"I need this for four months."
When do you go?
She just went crazy.
"Just blast away."
- Then she said,
"Here, go to rehearsal."
Okay.
Thank you, Pat.
My mother told me,
"Looks don't count."
She told me this a lot.
Saturday nights, in our kitchen, while I was growing up.
My mother used to look at me and say...
"Looks don't count!
Now get out of my sight, you big lump!"
And my mother lied because looks count...
It's very scary when you see yourself totally without any makeup.
It's really...
Ew, it gives me the willies.
Why?
"Who is that person?"
So I get up in the morning, and the first thing I do is,
I get into makeup.
Now, I was never the natural beauty.
No man has ever, ever told me I'm beautiful.
They've said to me,
"You look great.
You look this.
You're terrific."
But no man ever said,
"Oh, my God, you're so beautiful."
Good.
Bring 'em right in.
Yeah!
Good.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Looking good.
Good.
Aah, okay let's do tools.
And one-
Yeah, that's great!
Good. Yeah.
- Didn't you want the hand going to the side?
People want to look at pretty women.
Nobody wants an old woman,
so I started with the plastic surgery,
little bits and tweaks.
Then I got very angry because nobody would admit it.
I really became a big advocate of it.
And so then I became the poster girl for it, and then I became the joke of it.
Tools out a little bit.
Yeah, that's it.
Good.
- So how'd you come up with the title?
- Marilyn Monroe told that to me at a party.
- Yeah?
Yeah?
You and I were having a discussion before we went on the air today.
I said, if you don't feel good about yourself inside, plastic surgery will not help at all and in fact could make things worse, because then you think,
"Well, people don't- aren't really appreciating the real me."
Well, who is the real me?
Tell me...
You are the real me.
Well, don't-look, we want to be loved for our sense of humor, for our soul, for our sweetness, for our vulnerability, for our intelligence, yes?
I just want to be loved.
I met Edgar-
I had been on the Carson show,
and Edgar called, and he said to Johnny,
"Who do you know that's a good writer?"
And Carson said, "There was a girl writer on last week.
You should look her up. "
I met him, and I married him four days later.
Was I madly in love with him?
No.
Was it a good marriage?
Yes.
I thought marriage was going to be hugging and kissing like in the movies.
You walk hand in hand over the hill into the sunset.
You know what's on the other side of that hill?
Filthy dishes, that's what.
And socks.
- How was the last show last night?
- Very good, as a matter of fact.
Good, good.
- Without Edgar,
I couldn't have done it.
We worked together.
We worked on projects together, so it was a family business.
Any woman that has a child that doesn't yell is a fool.
Don't you think?
Didn't you yell?
- No.
- Why not?
It's your one chance to be noticed.
When I was having my kid, you should've-
"Aah!
Aah!"
And that was just during conception.
I just...
I was dying to be a mother.
I couldn't wait to be a mother,
and I really worked very hard to be there for her.
Of course, I'm sure she felt very deserted as a child, but I was-I was there as much as I could be
and I made sure we were a family unit
and she knew it.
And everyone's like,
"Oh, what was it like living with a legend?"
I'm like,
"Yeah, it was hilarious
when I was getting grounded, " which is why I always say to people, it's like,
"You don't realize
"how in these very extraordinary,
"abnormal circumstances what a normal world my parents created."
And that's a testament to them.
It's funny because she refers to her career as "the career,"
and it dawned on me one day that I had a sibling.
We all work on the career
as if it's a totally separate entity in the room.
- Melissa, what was your mom's reaction
when you told her you wanted to go into show business?
What was it we use to say?
Supportive yet not encouraging.
Yeah, and still am.
And still am, which is a little late in the game.
Yeah, but it-
- To be supportive and not encouraging.
- No, but it's such a hard business.
What I try to do with Melissa,
I try to protect her.
This is the one business in the world- it is total rejection.
And I'm 75, and I'm still rejected.
This business, you are mud your whole life.
Joce, Joce, are you there?
Yes.
Have you heard from Billy?
- I haven't.
I have got no calls back.
- All right.
Did you send him an email?
I really-I want him there to see the play before we go to Edinburgh.
I mean, there's Edinburgh.
There's London, my God.
He's got to see the play.
- Okay.
I'll email him as well.
- So that's my manager, Billy, who I adore, disappears all the time.
Three years ago, it was very, very bad, and I almost-
I almost fired him then.
And then, God, it's, you know, all this time.
I've known Billy- it's got to be about 35 years.
I could open the drawer here somewhere, and you'll, uh- you'll find pictures of Billy.
Here.
Look, young Billy, young Joan.
That's Edgar in the background.
And Billy is...
Billy is part of my life.
And I want to see him now because we're doing the play and I need another pair of eyes.
I need another brain.
I need his input desperately.
- Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome to what will be
Joan Rivers.;
A Work in Progress
by a Life in Progress.
Okay, here we go.
I am thrilled to be here.
I just don't want this to be about me, me, me, me, me.
Hello.
No, not-not yet, honey.
No, again, you too, back.
Go back.
Beautiful.
Anyhow...
Line.
"Now, where was I?"
Now, where was I?
Bill Cosby, who was a very good friend of mine,
was on The Tonight Show, and the comic that was on with Bill absolutely bombed, and Bill, God bless him, went over to the director, and he said, "Listen.
Why don't you use Joan Rivers?
She can't be any worse than the guy that was on tonight," and that's how they put me on.
They put me on the next night.
And it was one of those nights, um...
Do you know, like, when everything goes right?
Do you know?
When the stars are in alignment?
And the audience, we just connected.
And Carson, at the end of the act- after nine years of working bungalow colonies and strip joints and working in Greenwich Village in clubs where you'd pass the hat, the hat wouldn't come back- on the air, Carson said to me,
"You're going to be a star."
And I looked behind me.
"Well, who the hell is he talking to?"
And it was absolutely- it was magical between the two of us.
Absolutely magical.
- Don't you think men really like intelligence more when comes right down to it?
- Ugh, please, are we gonna go back to that?
Are you kidding?
- Oh, sure, I mean, it's a brain, you know, a caring person.
- No man has ever put his hand up a woman's dress looking for a library card.
I'm sorry.
Everyone watched the Carson show,
and when Carson said to me
"You're gonna be a star," my life changed.
- And as they say at Cape Canaveral, she took off like a rocket.
- The Tonight Show was a pinnacle for Joan,
and the more guest appearances she got,
either guesting with Johnny or guest-hosting for Johnny,
the bigger and stronger the career was going and building up and up and up.
And then eventually, they made her
the permanent guest host of The Tonight Show,
which was a big thing.
- After 20 years on The Tonight Show,
FO X came and offered me my own show,
and Edgar would be the producer.
Of course we said yes.
The first person I called was Johnny Carson.
He slammed the phone down.
I called him again.
He slammed it down again and never spoke to me again.
Ever.
I think he was furious.
He felt betrayed.
I was now a competitor.
He literally had me blacklisted,
and to this day,
I have not been on NBC Late Night ever.
- As she drove off the NBC lot, she lost her confidence.
"Oh, my God, what have I done?"
It was such a bad period.
- The Fox show, even before we went on the air,
was just a nightmare.
Edgar did not like
Rupert Murdoch and Barry Diller,
and from the day we walked in,
there were fights about everything,
about whether we should have
a Coke machine or Pepsi machine,
M&M's or Hershey Kisses.
Finally, they called me in on a Thursday night,
and they said,
"You've got to fire Edgar."
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't, uh...
I couldn't- couldn't do it.
Couldn't- couldn't do it.
- The woman who asked,
"Can we talk?"
Joan Rivers, is apparently through
as permanent host of her late-night talk show.
- From there, Edgar imploded, absolutely imploded.
He didn't have Joan's strength.
He didn't have it.
I got a call from Gavin de Becker, who was his security company.
They said, "Terrible news."
"Yes?"
"Edgar killed himself in Philadelphia."
He left us high and dry.
Everything just went to smithereens.
And he left me with no career and a lot of debts, because he wasn't a good businessman, and, uh, a lot of tough times.
I walk past Edgar's pictures.
I feel such sadness, such darkness.
- First off, Mother,
I'm very, very angry at you.
Since Daddy died, you have not spent one minute at home.
Melissa and I, we started immediately going into therapy, separately and together.
And then we did something which sounds so sick.
We did a movie about Edgar's suicide
where we played ourselves.
Are you angry about something?
- I'm angry about a lot of things, okay?
Okay.
It sounds so stupid and corny,
but I think by walking through it again,
it absolutely mended us,
totally mended the relationship.
Don't ask,; I'd have to go to another doctor
to figure that one out.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- Thanks again.
- Lovely that you came.
Thank you.
I worship you.
I worship you.
Get off your knees.
- Joan.
Joan, oh, my God.
Joan Rivers, everybody.
Please give her a clap.
- Billy sent me this for opening night.
Wait, wait, wait.
Polly wants a fucking cracker.
Give Polly a fucking cracker now!
Squawk!
Old lady on the cover.
Young people, young festival, young idea, old lady.
Hold on.
Get ready.
"Hottest ticket."
Isn't it great?
And the front page.
Oh.
The play went beyond my wildest dreams in Edinburgh.
We had great reviews, the audiences adored it, but who knows what's going to happen in London.
It can turn on a dime.
Now where are we?
- Oh, the signage is going up.
Look, your canopy is going up.
- Oh, isn't that sweet?
All right.
This is where we'll make the decision for me
whether or not I'm gonna try to bring it to New York.
Oh, If the reviews are bad, we're dead.
We finished it.
It was wonderful.
But it will not go to New York.
- Joan, this is
Graham McCluskey, your lighting designer.
Thank God.
Soft pink.
I don't care what it says.
- Joan didn't want to open the play in New York or L.A., because even if it's great, they will not give her the kudos that it's great because of who she is,
that there's nothing she can do that will be industry-embraced.
How much does it hold?
Uh, 393...
So it's 400.
Yes, of course.
- I have never been the critics' darling.
I've always been considered a comic and a Borscht Belt comic or a Vegas comic or- there's always an adjective before my name, and it's never a nice adjective.
I go back to Fun City,
which was my first play in 1973,
and they were- they were very harsh to it.
It was a horrible experience,
and I will not go through that again.
I mean, I moved us out of New York.
I said, "When that play closes, we're out of here, "
and we moved right after Fun City.
I just think they're not going to like us, and, uh... but I didn't spend all this time and all this energy to have this close.
And it breaks my heart to see it die here.
It won't die here.
- That's-that's- only that's killing me.
And I was thinking-
- All right, you're not going to lose it.
We won't let this go.
And I know it's your w- your work of love.
- I really think it's good.
I really think...
I know.
Okay.
Onward and upward.
Oh!
Hello, press!
Be kind.
Not too close.
Thank you.
Hello.
I'm very nervous.
I don't like opening nights.
I think you should celebrate second nights when you're a success.
I think anyone that celebrates opening nights is a fool, because you're not-that's- the opening night is your walk to the executioner.
So I will be very, very happy tomorrow if all goes well, and very smug, and I will throw some diva scene about something when I know I have the power.
Right now, I don't know if have the power.
You got enough glitter?
Yes.
Okay.
Oh, God, yes.
Plenty.
Plenty of glitter.
Oh, shut that stupid bitch up.
Jesus!
At the end of the show,
Johnny Carson, on the air, turned to me and said,
"You're going to be a star."
Vaginas drop.
I did not know this.
I am 75 years old, and I tell you,
I haven't peaked.
And that is why I'm going to go out that door and the door after that and the door after that and the door after that and the door after that, and I invite all of you.
Come with me!
Thank you.
Whoa.
Okay.
- That was pretty extraordinary.
All stood up right at the end.
In America, if this goes out in America, we love you, but you do stand up all the time at the end of shows whether- you know, like you're supposed to or something.
Here, they don't, except for this show.
What a triumph!
- Not a triumph till we read the papers.
- I know a triumph when I see one.
Tonight was a triumph.
I've never laughed so much.
Thank you very much.
Sorry to bother you.
You're not bothering me.
I thought you were brilliant.
- Are you feeling all the love that we have here for you?
No.
We'll feel it tomorrow after the reviews.
You were such a nice audience.
Thank you.
Now, let me ask you, when will we find out about the reviews?
Tomorrow morning first thing.
I'm pretty sure they're going to be fantastic.
And what does it say?
- "Comedy, tragedy, surgery, and Rivers isn't going quietly."
Okay.
- "If the energy dips slightly towards the end, that is understandable given the star's age."
- They only gave me three stars out of five.
Okay, Leicester Square.
"All this play-acting is an excuse
"for a night of 'Me, me' Joan.
"She is not short on self-pity,
"and a passage about her relationship
"with her daughter is pretty low-grade schmaltz, mind you."
It's so wrong.
It ends in a joke, you ass.
Exactly, that's why; he's just not getting the theater.
"Longer exposure to her even in a small theater
"betrays a husky weakness of voice that some may find monotonous."
And I'm thinking, Joce, do I want to take this into New York?
Do I want to sit in a taxi in New York in six months and hear this and see this again?
I don't know.
- Yeah.
I don't know, Jocelyn.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I am not going to walk in to New York City
and be hurt the way
Fun City hurt me.
My acting is my one sacred thing in my life,
and I will not have anyone hurt me with that.
You can say
I'm not a good comedian.
It doesn't bother me.
You say you didn't like me as an actress, you've killed me.
And I don't want that in New York.
But I know I'm an actress.
It's all about acting.
My career is an actress's career,
and I play a comedian.
So it's over.
It's over.
No one will ever take me seriously as an actress.
Don't be downhearted.
Are you downhearted?
I'm not down-I'm just...
It's not what I thought was going to happen.
What I thought was going to happen was, we were going to sail in from Edinburgh, everyone was going to love it, and then we were going to pick our producer and then move it forward and then change it, but not this, like- and of course, there's no Billy around.
Billy is never around in trouble.
And this is in trouble, you know.
Anyhow...
The play is over, and it hurts very much,
but I got to take a deep breath and start again.
It wouldn't kill you to get me another commercial.
Just remember, when they come in and ask for a man,
I can be very butch.
So she'll do anything and really get into it like she loves it.
Okay.
- Okay, well, if nobody has anything else,
I'm very depressed.
Bye.
- Bye, Steve.
- Okay, bye.
I don't want to retire.
I don't want to go and sit in the sun.
I don't want to go and learn to garden.
I paint.
Who cares?
Hello, Emily Hope.
- Hi, guys.
Pleasure to meet you.
Explain to us what you're offering.
Yes.
I will do anything.
I will knock my teeth out and do DentAssure or whatever it is.
I mean, she's done...
- I will wear a diaper.
I don't give a shit.
I think I should...
- Joan has a fanaticism, a maniacal focus to succeed,
and works at it every day.
I remember once meeting with Richard Pryor, and I sat with him and spent an hour with him, about his career, and I said "Okay, Richard,
"what we're going to do is,
"we're gonna do this, we're going to do that,
"and we're gonna plan on this, and then in the next year, we're going to do this, and we're going to do that."
And he looked at me, and he says,
"Larry, that's all great, but what the fuck do we do Monday?"
That's where Joan is:
"What the fuck do we do Monday?"
What is this?
- That's my thing.
I've been reading.
I am holding dossiers of all the people
for the Celebrity Apprentice that we pulled off of the internet.
"Brande."
B- R-A-N-D-E.
"Turn-ons:
Taking in a good movie
"while spending time with loved ones and my beautiful puppy,
Mercedes."
Aww.
"Turn-offs: Negative people who are unkind and have no respect for others."
Well, she's going to hate me.
Yeah, exactly.
- I'm doing
Celebrity Apprentice
because it's face time on NBC and NBC has not let me be on NBC since the Carson show.
- I didn't want her to do it.
She didn't want to do it.
I thought it was F-class people, but it is face time, prime-time network.
- And I think they'd be stupid to put me off the first four shows.
But I may be very free the second half of October.
I think they're not going to throw me off in the beginning because I'm the only one kind of that's a name.
Even though Donald says,
"These internationally known"-
"Entrepreneurs."
"Entrepreneur-celebrities."
- And you know, Billy,
I'm going to say that in the press release, that I was told that Paul Newman was going to be...
I am actually very excited about Celebrity Apprentice,
because Melissa, my daughter,
is going to be on the show with me,
which means we'll have a lot of time to spend together.
You haven't had your hair done yet?
No.
Jesus fucking Christ, Melissa.
- Why?
It's fine.
You've got 40 minutes.
That's more than enough.
- All right, let me move over here.
That's more than enough, Mom.
- No, it's not.
- For my hair, yes, it is.
- All right.
Whatever.
Melissa red-eyed in from L.A. This morning
and we start taping
Celebrity Apprentice tonight.
You got to stop smoking immediately.
I went to a pulmonary guy today.
What?
Am I boring you?
- No, no, no.
I'm listening.
I brought all my gum with me.
I'm down to, like, two or three a day.
That's it.
I'm telling you...
I know, but that's, you know- be supportive that I'm down to that.
- He said women react differently to cigarettes than men.
- All I'm saying is, I'm down to, like, two, three a day.
- He said more women are dying of lung cancer than breast cancer.
And nobody's discussing it.
So that's very interesting.
- Well, I'm down to, like, two, three, a day, so...
- Yeah, but I'm just telling you...
- I'm just saying I know.
- You're really loading a gun.
- I know, but I'm just saying, at least be supportive that I've gotten down to that.
- He scared the bejesus out of me.
The great pressure is,
what if she gets voted off ahead of me?
It's going to be very traumatic.
I would rather
I get voted off ahead of her.
I know that
I will always hold back.
I know that and so... because I don't want ever to come out brighter than Melissa and smarter than Melissa.
I just don't want-
I don't compete with her on that level.
- I believe that consciously she would believe that, and then even if I did win, she would say she held back, but I don't think she really could.
Okay, see you later.
- In the business, you have to put yourself first.
You got to protect yourself.
And my mother will tell you that she only wants me to win,
but then she'll do something without realizing it
that is very destructive.
And I think it's a very tough dynamic, because I truly think it's completely subconscious with her.
Will you open that?
Okay.
- That's a nice
Dooney and Bourke bag.
- These are very nice goodie bags.
Yeah.
I feel very out of place.
I'm the oldest by far.
They all were talking and chatty, and for a long time,
I stood by myself, and I felt very isolated.
- Well, see, I think you also bring a lot of that on yourself.
I think you don't make any- like tonight, you made no effort to be, like, welcoming.
I stood there-
Well, no, but I'm saying, but you were on your BlackBerry so fast, and I tried to introduce you to people, and you were already like,
"Uh, hi, bye," because you get so shy, and that's what people don't know about you.
Hell, I wouldn't walk over to you.
Well, they didn't.
- But you made- but you set it up for that.
You don't realize that you do that...
All stand-ups are innately insecure.
Who would stand on a stage by themselves and say, "Laugh"?
"Laugh at me.
Laugh with me.
I don't care.
Just laugh."
And I think that's just sort of the nature of the beast.
Overall, I just- sort of my perception growing up in the world of comedians:
They're all very damaged, and they need that reassurance.
It's all a cover.
It's been a bloodbath.
They don't play fair.
They cheat.
- So Melissa was fired, um, on Tuesday,
and I know Joan was very upset.
She is a snake.
- Annie Duke was on a team with Melissa
and absolutely conspired to get Melissa fired.
- Annie Douche, that fucking moron.
Would you right now, Graham, onto my blog and onto my Twitter, it should be,
"Annie Douche, that moron, she should kiss my ass."
She should kiss my Jewish ass, but not with those non-kosher lips.
Not with those big pig lips.
That's it:
"She should kiss my Jewish ass, but not with those big pig lips."
Do you think that's too rough?
So tell me, you didn't think it was going to get vicious?
- No, I just thought it was at least going to be moderately fair.
And my concern is how I will be portrayed because I have more of an image issue than you do.
So that's a little unsettling.
- It meant you're going to look very angry, and they already said, when you left you really called them all kinds of names.
So that's there.
- But if they cut it to show that I was telling the truth...
- Oh, they're not going to cut it to show you were telling the truth,
'cause they don't care.
They're going to show that you left pissed off.
But you also came back, and you also worked, and you also- that's all right.
I think it makes you more interesting,
Melissa, frankly.
- You have done really an amazing job, but, Melissa, you're fired.
- Whore!
Pit viper.
I want my, and I want it now.
Not getting without it.
- It makes me very upset to see her that hurt.
It wasn't even hurt.
It was the frustration of the lies.
It is such a cruel business.
Sometimes, I just want to say to her,
"Why in God's name are you opening yourself up
to such punishment?"
I mean, mine is not a choice.
Mine is, uh...
Mine is-I always say, it's like, uh- people say, "Why are you in the business?"
Ask a nun why she's a nun.
That's my drive at 4:00 in the morning in the airport.
It's-I have no choice.
And that's where I was from the time
I could figure it out.
No question where I was going.
There were no drugs.
There was no sex.
There was no any- nothing until I got my job.
That's where I was going, and just go away.
Mohammed, it's going to be a long evening.
We're doing two shows tonight.
- Joan Rivers?
- Yes?
- Do you mind autographing this for me?
- Oh, my goodness.
Yes, of course.
I love you.
- Every Wednesday night when I'm in New York,
I work in some tiny little club where I can practice my act.
I just talk about anything and everything that annoys me.
Thank you.
- You don't get the recognition you deserve.
Damn right, William.
Okay, see?
I have a fan.
I have William.
The minute you're not angry about things, the minute you're not upset about things, what are you talking about?
"Oh, my grandson was so cute."
It's not my comedy.
I'm furious about everything, furious about everything.
Good things don't always happen to good people, and I'm very angry about it.
But if I didn't have the anger,
I wouldn't be a comedian.
Anger fuels the comedy.
I hate everybody.
I hate old people.
I hate ugly children.
I hate fat people.
I hated China.
I hate whiners.
Oh, I hate dead people.
I even have the three wise men who I hate.
I love anal sex 'cause you can do other things, you know?
It's like...
You can iron.
You can read a book.
Get your emails on your BlackBerry.
- Well, right now, we're getting the 17-foot table up the stairs.
These two guys just walked it up seven flights and...
Bring it right here.
Today is Thanksgiving.; favorite time of the year, favorite time of the year.
Melissa and Cooper come, of course,
and then I invite my friends, and many of them are strays
or single women or my neighbors from downstairs.
It's sad.
Why is that?
- I don't know, just sad that it seems you have fewer friends in New York, and I know when something wonderful happens, there are maybe three people
I'll call, when maybe 15 years ago, there would have been six people
I'd call.
So many people are dying, my God.
They'd better eat fast tonight.
Oh, it's cold!
Every Thanksgiving,
I bring meals from God's Love We Deliver to people that absolutely are too ill to go out.
This year I asked my grandson
Cooper to come with me.
If you what?
If we can stop at an electronics store, his PSP is broken.
But If you're very good,
I'll buy you a new one for your birthday.
- Well, my friend had three of them, and he gave me one.
That's very nice.
Is this the one he gave you?
Yes.
He had three of them?
Has he got a single grandfather?
I love your hands.
They're great hands, Cooper.
At God's Love We Deliver, when I started out, and I'm on the board, we used to give AIDS patients that were going, we would give them food.
Well, now AIDS is chronic, and I am still delivering their fucking food.
I am so pissed.
I am so- you know what it's like?
Thanksgiving morning, ding-dong, the guy opens the door,
"You again?"
"This is the third fucking
Thanksgiving in a row, buddy."
"Miss Rivers, just leave it over there.
I'm on my way to the gym."
"The gym?
"You're going to die today.
AIDS or me;
I'm not sure which."
Oh, look.
Oh, "God's Love We Deliver."
Aw, how nice is that?
You want to ring?
Hello, hello.
- Hi.
- I'm Joan Rivers.
This is my grandson, Cooper.
And how nice to see you.
Joan Rivers?
The Joan Rivers?
I pay her bills.
- You have entertained me for years, Miss Rivers.
I'm so glad.
I'm a photographer.
- Yeah, you can see there's something going on here that's wonderful.
- Right there, I photographed the same drugstore for 20 years, every time they changed the price of cigarettes.
Oh, how brilliant is that?
Thank you.
Where was it shown?
Life magazine.
I have taken over 100,000 photos, so you might even know my work.
Look up FloFox. Com.
- Thank you.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- I can't wait to get out of here and go home and look you up.
- Flo Fox, baby.
My name is Flo Fox.
I'm with Flo Fox right now.
What happened that caused your eyesight to start to fail?
- I believe it's connected with multiple sclerosis.
I walk with a cane.
I'm a little off-balance.
First my eyes went and...
Oh, it's so sad.
There's this sexy, young, artistic, edgy,
New York, tough, bohemian girl.
- It's amazing isn't it?
- Yeah.
Life is so mean.
And I thank you all for being here.
This morning, I delivered meals with my grandson for God's Love We Deliver, and may I tell you, we are so blessed.
We are so blessed, and I thank God every minute that I ever step into a limousine.
I know it sounds silly.
Since 1968, they've been sending limousines for me, and I never get into one that I don't say,
"Thank you, God.
I am so chosen."
And I thank you all for being here, and I thank God for another wonderful Thanksgiving.
Hear! Hear!
- We are at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, D. C.
I am here to do a tribute to George Carlin.
I find this whole thing very hypocritical.
This is everything
George claimed he wasn't.
George hated the establishment.
George hated the people that are going to be here tonight, which are going to be a bunch of older, very wealthy Republicans.
All the things that George fought against
tonight will all be negated
because he's getting the Mark Twain award.
It would be like me getting a big award from the German Bund.
"And now for funniest Jewess not in the ovens,
Joan Rosenberg Rivers!"
But, um, there's an importance for me
for this type of an event for comedy, because I'm always left out of it.
So for me, this is nice to be included, because I'm usually not included.
Once a Jew, always a Jew.
I'm going in to clean that bathroom.
- Have you seen that shower in there?
It's kind of interesting.
Ugh.
Oh, look.
Now it is.
- The writers are ready for you when you want them.
I'm ready for the writers.
Okay.
Okay, where are the writers?
They're coming in here?
Yeah.
Now, is it just the two of us?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Miss Rivers, the "fuck" thing,
I know the executive producers are a little concerned about that.
Yes, and well they should be.
I probably will have one "fuck" somewhere in there.
- That's fine.
- Just to get the audience...
- No, exactly.
One is fine.
And it will be bleeped for TV.
- Yes.
- I have no problems.
All right, guys, see you later.
Thanks, Joan.
See you in a bit.
- Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
They're all going to be so much funnier than I am.
See, when you see the lineup, and you know Jon Stewart had 12 writers work on this, and you know, uh, Garry had six writers work on this.
And you know all these people- look who's here.
They all have professional staffs.
Wow.
- You know, there's a lot of his stuff that's-
- Joan, um, what is it like being a comedic icon?
I'm sure there are comedians that come up to you and say,
"You were an inspiration."
I'm not ready to be an icon, and I'm not ready to be told thank you.
Fuck you.
- Lewis Black.
Margaret Cho.
Ben E. King.
- Don't know him.
- Dennis Leary.
- Clever.
- Bill Maher.
- Brilliant.
- Joan Rivers.
- Okay.
- Garry Shandling.
- Brilliant.
- Jon Stewart.
- Smart.
- Ben Stiller.
- Eh... lucky.
- And Lily Tomlin.
- Brilliant.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
George Carlin.
- The Smothers Brothers and Laugh-ln.
And it was such a great time to be in comedy.
Few people are always funny,
but certainly one of the chosen people
is our next presenter, the fabulous Joan Rivers, ladies and gentlemen.
- We use to play these terrible clubs.
Literally, you didn't get paid.
You passed the hat, and some nights, the hat would come back with a severed head.
Some nights...
And they asked me to say a couple of words about George, and I kept thinking that is so unfair.
You cannot sum George Carlin up in two words.
Give me at least seven.
And...
You were so funny.
I think today went very well.
I think I did not embarrass myself at all.
I think I was fine.
I think I was funnier than a lot of people, not as funny as a lot of people,
but, uh, yeah,
I was perfectly fine.
- I am getting ready to go to Wisconsin.
I've never done an act before in Mukluks.
They have no idea.
- They'll stare at me when I say,
"Where are the gays?"
They're going to tell us,
"Dead, we killed them."
Why am I going to Wisconsin?
A thing called money.
They're so desperate to get me, they're paying me.
That's why I'm going to Wisconsin.
I worked last night.
I worked in Toronto until about 2:30 in the morning on The Shopping Channel.
Then I got up at 5:00 to make a 7:00 plane or something to Chicago.
And then from Chicago,
I took a little, what they call, "puddle jumper."
It was adorable.
How is the gay community here?
That I really don't know.
Oh, see.
Ask your cousin.
Ask your wife's brother.
- Is this the most remote place?
No-oh, no.
- Well, where is the most remote place
you've ever played?
- The most remote place
I've ever played was Reykjavik, Iceland.
I've played them all.
Juneau.
Oh, are they wrong.
That was called the Texas Motel.
They are so off.
Some places, as you know, are better than others.
This would not be my first choice of décor.
The audience is going to be very born-again,
I have a feeling, very fundamentalist.
They're going to get very shaken up.
Get the check.
Yeah, right.
Whatever I do on stage...
Are they gonna clean the stage a little bit?
Because I kind of roll around on it and stuff.
It's a little...
Ick.
There's gum.
Aren't you the makeup person?
You win the award, that showed up with no makeup.
Don't you have your makeup?
Aren't you the makeup girl?
She's the makeup girl, and she didn't bring makeup.
"May."
Good month.
Of next year.
May of next year.
You leave New York, you leave L.A., you leave the world.
But that's what makes it charming.
First of all, where are- where are we?
What the hell is going-
I was out in the casino.
A guy put a quarter in, fish came out.
Uh, well, never mind Viagra.
What about Cialis?
36 fucking hours a man has an erection?
An 85-year-old man for 36 hours?
That's devil's work.
And on these poor, old, dried-out old wives?
And these guys on top of them, in and out, in and out, in and out.
They're going to set them on fire.
It's-yes.
Ugh, I hate children.
The only child that I think
I would have liked ever was Helen Keller because she didn't talk.
It is just...
Not very funny.
Yes, it is.
And if you don't, then leave!
- It's not very funny if you have a deaf son.
- I happen to have a deaf mother.
Oh, you stupid ass.
Let me tell you what comedy is about.
- You go ahead and tell me what comedy's about.
- Oh, please.
You are so stupid.
Comedy is to make everybody laugh at everything and deal with things, you idiot.
My mother is deaf, you stupid son of a bitch.
Don't tell me.
And just in case you can hear me in the hallway,
I lived for nine years with a man with one leg.
Okay, you asshole?
And we're going to talk about what it's like to have a man with one leg who lost it in World War II and never went back to get it, because that's fucking littering.
So don't you tell me what's funny.
Comedy is to make us laugh.
If we didn't laugh, where the hell would we all be?
Think about that.
Where the hell would we all be?
How can you not find Osama?
There is one- there is one outlet.
He's on dialysis.
There is one outlet in all of Afghanistan.
Find the plug...
And follow the cord.
Well, okay.
How about that?
"I have a- a deaf son!"
Oh, what a good way to build.
That was a very difficult moment.
It throws you terribly, because you know the audience is so nervous and so scared to laugh.
Your mind is going a mile a minute.
"Where am I going to go?
What am I going to do?
Where am I going to take them?"
So there are two things going on, your mouth and your head.
Luckily, I was able to get them back.
- Thank you.
You are so-
I've never laughed so hard in my life!
- Oh, you were a good laugher, and that makes such a difference.
- Oh, I know, and that-that rotten guy.
I'm sorry for him.
- I was ready to get up and say-and tell him to leave.
He has a deaf son.
- I know, but he's got to realize that this is comedy.
- Comedy.
- Right.
- I felt terribly sorry for the man with the deaf son, and of course he's angry.
Of course he's angry.
I get that, but don't ruin the whole act.
But maybe it got it out of him, and maybe it's good what happened to him too.
He had kind of a catharsis.
And you're driving us?
- Yep.
- Have you been drinking?
- No, ma'am.
- Have you been drugging?
- No.
Have you been whoring?
I may have been.
Okay, well, that's good.
Then you'll be relaxed.
You ought to just head for New York and just get me home.
There's nothing like your own bed.
Nothing like your own bed.
They called my agent.
They wanted to get
William Shatner.
He said no.
They wanted to get
George Hamilton.
He said no.
So I said,
"A woman should do it.
And I'll do it."
Extend.
Extend, which is, you take a pill, and the man's penis just grows, grows.
Not penile enlargement, just, "Oh, look, who's a big boy now!"
- Joan will turn nothing down at all.
Nothing.
- And she hears the clock ticking every minute of every hour of every day.
- I'm going to Palm Springs for-what is this for?
Do you know what this is for?
The Betty Ford Clinic.
- This is for the Betty Ford Clinic, so they'll be very serious about drugs.
All right, well, uh,
Are they lining you up like Nazis?
All right.
That's all right.
Okay.
"Sorry, bitch.
"I'm not Carol Channing, but this will have to do.
Much love, Joan Rivers."
Thank you.
I have Ss, sibilant Ss.
Ss, ss.
Even a little more.
If you take out the top or the bottom, that usually works pretty well.
- This is the early Joan, and this is me.
"Oh, darling.
Can we talk?
Oh, does this tampon make me look fat?"
- We're going to go straight down this hallway.
- I'll follow you.
- Okay.
- I love that the nails match the dress.
I think that's so fabulous.
Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Be careful.
Be careful; it's wet.
Victoria Beckham,
"Uch, uch, does the tampon make me look fat?"
I can't stand her.
Okay.
Up we go.
And we're going to Minneapolis, right?
Yes. It's cold there.
- All right.
And thank you.
You were terrific.
Pleasure meeting you.
Thank you.
Hello.
I don't care if it's God himself.
No one is to call my room until 6:30.
Okay.
- Save your money when you're younger, that you don't have to whore yourself out when you're old.
To be roasted,
Comedy Central.
Oh, God.
- I know, but the money is extraordinary.
I am so depressed.
I can't even go there with you now.
This-this is the cherry on the cake.
Mohammed, could you stop for a moment so I can get out in front of the car?
And could you just run me over?
End it now, Mohammed.
It can't be...
Oh, do you know the jokes?
Every joke is going to be plastic surgery or old.
It comes back at you, doesn't it?
Yep.
God.
- Miss Rivers to the set, please.
- Slate here.
Stand by.
And action.
This tastes like urine!
You crazy fucking bitch.
The crew loves me.
They keep telling you it's an honor.
I'm telling you that if
I had invested wisely,
I wouldn't be doing this.
- By the way, did you know that I have never done a roast in my life?
It's so disgusting.
They're not disgusting.
It is an honor.
I'm telling you.
No, don't make that face.
But the money is very good.
- The money is good, which is an honor.
I mean, I'm an artist, and I'm doing it for the art like you are.
Yes, precisely.
- Couple of artists, with easels, sitting around, collecting our money.
- Joan will cross to her seat, all right, in, let's say, three, two, one, go.
Talk about lucky!
Brad and Angelina are having a sale!
Look at them!
Go on down now.
Auntie Joanie's busy.
Fuck. Sh-
Okay, no, no, don't go yet.
We're just-and this is-
At this point, that's when you would go.
- Could somebody help me here, please?
No, no, really.
Don't bother.
- You know, if everybody's giving you a standing ovation, that joke probably won't read that well.
- I beg you.
It will read.
I will wait until the standing ovation is over.
I will get up here-
- They will not sit down till you sit down.
- Well, then, they're going to stand until I sit.
I'm pleading with you, don't knock every joke, or it's not going to be funny.
I'm begging you.
I'm pleading with you.
I will thank them, and then I will either sit down and miss the chair.
I will do something funny, because I am a funny person.
Hello, hello, hello!
We are here to celebrate the career of a groundbreaking comedian and a legendary bitch.
- How much worse could your real face look than that clown mask you've had welded onto your head?
- Look at her.
She's a cougar.
Freddie Cougar.
- Joan's face has been lifted so many times that when she sneezes, she has to blow her clit.
I get mad at myself.
I think, at this age,
you've been doing it since 1966,
and you shouldn't let them upset you anymore,
but they do.
I did the Comedy Central roast, okay?
And, uh, yeah, which was great, which was great.
I- I was-they-they- they said such mean, disgusting, filthy- they called me a whore and a cunt and a this and a that.
I kept thinking,
"How do they know me?"
It is just...
Oh, oh, sure.
Turn against the queen.
It's like Marie Antoinette.
Yeah, like you're going to do better with Kathy Griffin.
Fuck you.
It is just... when she lasts 45 years, then go stand on my grave.
Just kidding.
I love Kathy.
Where's Billy these days?
I have no idea.
He's no longer really part of my career.
He can't be.
You spend too much energy looking for Billy and too many phone calls coming in from people that haven't heard from Billy, and, uh, can't deal with it.
- You know it's bad when people say something to me.
You know what I'm talking about?
I run into people, and they're like,
"Oh, we were trying to reach Billy, and he never called us back."
I'm like, "I don't know what to tell you."
- Yeah, but let us know.
Yeah, just say, "Call Jocelyn."
Yeah.
- Billy, unfortunately, is no longer part of my team.
I sent him an email saying
we're no longer in business together.
He just can't be counted on, and it's killing me.
I'll tell you why it really upset me.
Billy is one of the last links that I can say,
"Do you remember?"
And I had to cut that off, and I think that's- it's not the business.
That's where l-
I cannot tell you
I will never not miss Billy.
He was there when Melissa was born.
He was there for Edgar's funeral, you know?
He's a link.
I have no one to say,
"Do you remember when
Bernie Brillstein gave his party and Edgar was the only one that came in black tie?"
I know it sounds- he was my last memory bank, and I have no one-no one- to say that to now.
And that is very difficult for me.
Tonight is the live finale of Celebrity Apprentice, and it is between me and Annie Duke.
If I win, I'm back.
I'm back in spite of being a woman, in spite of being 75, and in spite of being blackballed from NBC.
I'm back, you bastards.
- And it's been a tremendous, tremendous season.
Annie, do you know what I'm going to say?
No, I have no idea.
I'm going to say, Annie... you're fired.
- It's great.
This has been wonderful.
It's great.
It's terrific.
Ah.
Here we go.
But it's just
Celebrity Apprentice.
I mean, it's not the Academy Awards, but it was wonderful.
And I'm very happy I won.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now, I've always said, you can't get hit by lightning if you're not standing out in the rain.
Nobody can stand in the rain longer than Joan Rivers.
She will stay there.
She's the last person standing.
She'll let it rain.
She'll let it rain.
She'll let it rain, because she knows lightning can hit, 'cause it's hit her more than once.
But she knows you have to stay out in the rain.
And she did.
Line two.
- Line two.
Okay.
Hello, my sweetheart.
Yeah.
All right, so tell me.
Tell me yes or no; just tell me fair.
Aah!
That's fabulous!
Are you-oh!
Jocelyn!
We were picked up!
- No way.
- Yeah, we got it.
- Awesome!
- All right, all right.
- You know what the real pinnacle in a comedy career is?
It's not an Oscar.
It's not one thing.
It's the fact that you're still doing it.
That's really what's so rock star about her.
She's really the master of sticking in there.
Wait, wait.
Let's talk about what this is gonna entail.
It's a photo shoot for The New York Times?
- I could do it
Monday afternoon if they want.
I'm still in town.
Right now, everything is absolutely wonderful.
I am the golden girl.
But I have been here before, and I know, nothing is yours permanently, and you'd better enjoy it while it's happening.
So... next week, Monday:
Regis and Kelly, book signing, and QVC.
Tuesday.; WOR, Rachael Ray,
Howard Stern, Cutting Room.
Wednesday.; Florida, breakfast lecture,
do an afternoon book signing,
back to Miami, perform two shows.
Thursday.; L.A.,
The Doctors, radio show, red-eyeing home, QVC,
corporate booking, then back to Cutting Room.
Okay, I'm fine.
Is that locked?
Get him out of the picture.
It's me alone.
It's an "artist alone" shot.
I'm grabbing you, Mohammed.
Thank you.
I am opening for Don Rickles, and when they say opening,
what it is, is, he and I split the money.
And years ago when we started,
I said "Well, I'll open,
'cause that means
I get out earlier," and he's still pissed about it.
The theater is wonderful here,
It's a Vegas-sized theater.
It's 1,800 or 2,000.
- No, it's 4,000.
Yeah.
It's a 4,000-person theater.
I'm nervous.
- But I go way back with Joan when she was in Vegas and she was a struggling comedian.
And we got to know each other.
She's done an outstanding job with her career.
I mean that.
She has outstanding timing, and she takes her work very seriously.
And if I didn't marry my Barbara,
I would have married Joan, and with that remark...
Aah, gaah.
God.
Oh, God.
I was kidding around!
Oh, God, why?
- Don Rickles is in his late 80s,
and he is still hilarious.
He's like George Burns,
who was amazing until he was in his late 90s,
and Phyllis Diller.
Until she was 92, she just laid it down.
And I'd like to beat them all, and I think I will.
That's what's so sick.
I think I will.
First wife is always some poor, dumb bitch who he married on the way up.
Second wife is always like,
"Hello," and he's an asshole and marries her.
And the third wife, he's 96.
The balls are on the ground.
She's 11.
She's Chinese.
"I ruv you."
Thank you.
It's been a pleasure.
This is where I belong.
Only time I'm truly, truly happy is when I am on a stage.
- Why can't you do a good job once?
It's embarrassing.
I keep saying,
"She's wonderful," and you always fail me.
I am a performer.
That is my life.
That is what I am.
That's it.
- I do hate children, and that's the truth.
Oh, God, so Halloween, and they,
"Oh, lady, we don't like apples."
"Then just eat the razor blades."
It is so...
- Joan, love you, love you, love you.
I love you, love you back.
Who do I make this to?
Lucy.
- I can spell-
- I have all your jewelry.
Love you.
I love everything you've done for women.
Love all your humor, all your grace.
Oh, thank you.
- You're the best.
- Oh, Lucy.
Love you.
Lucy, I love you back.
Surprise!
So bored that they're taking torture away in the United States.
Oh, it was-
Oh, like-like- oh, like torture is bad.
"Oh, waterboarding, waterboarding."
Oh, big fucking deal.
Try getting a bikini wax one time.
Get a Brazilian wax.
You'll give up secrets you never knew you had.
They're doing a documentary of my life.
- And you said earlier that they're just waiting for the moment, right?
- They are praying that I'll die during this-this film.
Wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't that be amazing?
They got the last year of Joan Rivers.
It would give them such a hook.
- People would watch.
- People would watch.
That's sick.
- I know, but wouldn't it- but still, sick but very commercial.
You'd watch.
I'd watch.
Wouldn't you?

(GASPS) Oh!
WOMAN 1: Turn her over, right.
WOMAN 2: She really sleeps better on her side. So...
And what you do is put something under the mattress so the bed's an inclined bed. Okay.
And just have light blankets.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
'Cause, um...

I mean, it's a correlation, it's not a causal thing, right?
Yeah. And the other thing they're finding that really surprised me...

so, dyson, you're not worried
About your coworkers walking in on us?
Gotta love statutory holidays.
Right on your desk, huh?
That's hardly police protocol.
Ohh. That s...
Lo.. Auaugh
I hope the neighbors don't call the cops.
- I am the cops.
- Ah, well...
Thank you for respond to my emergency, officer...
'cause when I neededo heal,
I need it now.
Yeah, funny thing, though-
I didn't notice so much as a scratch on you.
What can I say?
I was hungry.
Huh.
Speaking of which, what's a girl gotta do around here
To get some breakfast, huh?
Breakfast, huh? that might make things confusing.
Fine. No breakfast.
Is that a rule?
I never much liked rules, but maybe we should have some.
Seriously?
Feels kinda high school.
I wouldn't know.
Never went.
Okay.
Well...
In the spirit of clarifying this,
What else?
Rule number two-
No discussing our arrangement with other people.
Hmm. Exception-kenzi.
She already knows, and she pouts when I fib.
Okay. Rule three-
We come, we go.
No questions asked.
No sad good-byes.
Oh, good one.
And how about, as long as we're doing this,
You don't get to give me
That "I don't get to take this case" speech?
As long as you always tell me what cases you do take. deal.
And as far as seeing other people?
Well, we're not exclusive,
Right?
Right.
Right. Okay. what are you doing?
Walking you to your car.
No sad good-byes, remember?
I'm not crying.
I'm just seeing you out. don't you get it, dyson?
I can take care of myself.
Hey, princess.
Oh, great. sorry, about your, uh... get in the van.
Nuts.
life is hard when you don't know who you are.
It's harder when you don't know what you are.
My love carries a death sentence.
I was lost for years,
Searching while hiding...
Only to find that I belonged to a world hidden from humans.
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

Ms. Sizemore, bo investigates is
The premiere p.I. Service in the city.
I'm so relieved to hear you say that.
I- I honestly don't know where else to turn.
Well, tell me what we're dealing with here. she's trying to kill me.
I- I know that may not seem like a big deal.
Oh, that sounds like a massive dealio. Yes.
Uh, does this "she" have a name?
Ms. Snickerpants.
Your, uh, your... Boss?
My cat.
Mm-hmm.
I went to the police. They looked at me like I was crazy.
Crazy?
Gosh. Hardly.
Um... You know we get paid in real-life money, right?
Oh.
Would you like some more cream soda?
Can we please get some more cream soda?
Bo will be here any minute.
She's just, uh, detained.
Probably wrangling another sociopathic kitty.
Oh, ms. Snickerpants isn't a sociopath. Uh...
She's, uh, possessed.
See?
Yes.
It's becoming quite clear.
I'm just gonna check my messages again, okay? this really puts the "suck" in "succubus."
Yanking girls off the street, huh?
That's a hell of a way to drum up business for the dim sum.
You guys go wait in the van.
I got little miss thang here.
Thing this. what's wrong with you?!
You know, you really should invest in a cup.
Thanks, but I'll take my egg foo yong to go.
You're outta luck, kid.
I should know.
I feed off the stuff.
So...
I'm mayer.
The boob that you nailed in the kishkes
Is my nephew seymour.
Told you she was no good.
Oh, I'd say she's very good.
Now get us some water.
Water!
Now we can talk.
I'd like to hire you.
Investigate a little problem
I'm having.
You kidnap me,
Clearly need family therapy.
That's not a great first impression, mayer.
Let me explain.
Maybe we can help each other.
Like I mentioned,
I'm a luck fae.
I feed off the luck of humans who come here to bet.
In the human world,
I work as a bookie,
Run numbers
On everything from sports to natural disasters.
Sounds super, but I'm not much of a gambler.
No, but you're something better.
You're not a dark fae.
You can go where my guys can't.
What, places that require good hygiene?
I'm serious.
I've been duped by a human.
My security tapes from yesterday.
I was having a business matter
With seymour...
When in came one of my favorite customers-roger.
he got a last name?
No last name required.
He always paid cash.
I've been feeding off roger for years.
The schmuck virtually had no luck left.
So why did you take his bet?
Well, I gotta make cash for the guys upstairs.
I take it you're acquainted with the morrigan?
Yeah, what a peach. don't get me started.
Still, it's a perfect fit.
I eat and provide funds for our side.
This time, things didn't go as planned.
Now I had drained roger of all his luck.
There was no way he could've won on his own.
again, I'm here...
I need an outsider to investigate roger-
Someone who won't advertise my little problem.
Even if I could forget that you van-napped me-
Which I won't- why would I help you?
Because I can give you ten minutes with my niece.
Oh, tempting. Is she cute?
Word on the street is you want to know where you came from.
She sees things.
I'll let you have a taste for free,
And you'll see.
Cassie's the real deal,
A bona fide oracle.
What up, homeys?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Bo, pick up. This is me, leaving a fifth message.
I really hope you're on your way.
Paranoid puss in boots is getting shifty.
Where are you going?
To find a private investigator who will take me seriously. Ma'am, we are serious as shit!
Okay?
Bo is just a little late.
How are you gonna find a way to cure my cat
If you can't even find your boss?
Oh, bo's not my boss.
She's the muscle.
Well, the... Love muscle of sorts.
Um...
Amateurs.
Okay, fine.
Bo's obviously not coming,
But I am willing to take your case
For half the price. please. I'm not gonna hire the assistant.
And I can't cover the check.
Thanks, bo.
You?
You're gonna read my future?
What was, what will be- the whole shit sandwich.
I need to know who my parents were.
Mmm. but how do I know if-
I'm telling the truth? why don't we visit your past,
See if we can't stir up something significant?
Come here.
You were 18.
He was your first love.
Kurt?
No. Kyle.
He wanted what all boys want.
Your parents taught you it was wrong, very wrong.
But he persisted,
And you adored him.
Then you got hungry.
You fed on him,
Drained him, then passed out.
When you awoke, you came face-to-face
With your true self, with your birthright... with death.
You had no idea what that meant,
What you were-
A sinner, a killer, a beast.
So you ran.
Haven't been back since.
Told you I was legit.
Channeling totally gives me cotton mouth.
You got a mint?
So... We got a deal?
We can't trust her.
Another groin shot for the road?
I find out how roger beat the house,
Cassie reads me again-
This time, about my parents.
Good luck.
Like you got any to spare.
Hello.
You're a tardy 'tang. what, did kenzi wake up on the wrong side of the bed?
Mm, we can't afford beds.
Remember, we had a meeting? oh, shit. Client.
Yeah, I upload the calendar to your phone,
I tape post-it reminders over the sink.
Kenzi-
Dude, I even learned how to spreadsheet. Me!
'cause it's my way of contributing.
Somebody's gotta keep you on schedule.
I'm not a train.
No, you're the talent with the great caboose.
Do you think I like acting like the adult?
Probably no more than I enjoyed
Being abducted off the street two hours ago.
And I'm a dink.
No, I should have called, once I earned my freedom.
What happened?
Van...
Dark fae, potential information about my parents.
I'm sorry.
Fortune cookie?
Now where are you going?
Just bank the outrage for a while, okay?
Mama's too tired to chat.
Oh, but could you call dyson and tell him I'd love to talk?
Thanks.
Will do!
Partner. let me get back to you, okay? I'll call you back.
So we'll take this image from the security tape
And we'll run it through the facial recognition.
And she wets herself over your geek skills.
My bad.
I don't like you working for mayer.
Too bad you don't get to tell me what cases I can take anymore,
As per our agreement.
Uh-huh.
Just think of it as getting free intel on the dark.
Why doesn't mayer have his own guys looking into this?
He probably doesn't want his fae bosses to know he got conned. interesting. Here it is.
Thanks.
See you around?
Could be.
Right behind you. Just gotta hit the ladies' room...
'cause I just barfed in my mouth.
Dude, I can't believe
I backed you with bo.
You made me look like a total tool.
And the worst part is, you treated her like shit,
But somehow, you're forgiven.
That is why I'm no longer on team dyson.
Peace.
So what was that back there with dyson, huh?
Pretty nice house for a compulsive gambler.
Pretty nice change of topic.
Hi. Uh, sorry to bother you, but we're here to see-
Roger? Of course. Welcome.
♪
Thank you.
Just in time to party.
Though we're a tad bit underdressed.
Ooh. Whiskey. Thank you.
Classy.
Ahh. Unlike, say, boinking peeps to death?
Touché. so where's mayer's big winner?
Uh, kenzi?
This isn't a party party.
Here he is-
The guest of honor,
My roger.
He looks, um,
Peaceful.
And really, really dead.
Uh...
When did he... Bite it?
Two days ago. excuse me. that was 24 hours
Before he walked into mayer's and placed a bet.
Yeah, no kidding.
Mayer was wrong.
Roger wasn't unlucky. no, he was a bloody miracle.
You didn't eat one of those toadstools, did ya?
No. But riddle me this-
How does a dead guy walk around town, placing bets?
I mean, I've heard gambling's an addiction, but come on.
A dead human walking?
Mnh-mnh.
What, fae zombies?
The chinese call them hsien.
We call them body jumpers.
They can inhabit a recently dead human just by touching them.
What, like a ghost?
No, except they have bodies, but they don't like them.
Nasty bastards.
- Well, what's so bad about that?
- It's distasteful.
Humans are for feeding off of, not wearing.
Ha.
That's funny.
That's what I do.
That's your third energy drink, and you still look like shit.
Hale, she is relentless.
This is the first break
I've had all week.
I'm gonna do you a favor and give bo my digits,
And I'll cover your shift.
Huh?
I can manage, brother.
Thanks, though.
Clearly.
So listen, what's it like with a succubus?
Tell me.
You remember daphne?
The nymph?
Uh-huh.
Hourly. Yes!
Well, I lost her number, and I don't even care.
Damn.
Hey.
We were just talking about you.
Really?
Yes.
I was saying that if anyone in town knows a hsien...
A hsien?
God, for a bunch of far-out fairy folk,
You guys are pretty judgmental.
I know a hsien, our side.
Works as a morgue attendant.
There.
Was that so hard, huh?
You want my help or not?
Of course. You never know when I might get injured
On an investigation, need a little healing.
What about rule number two?
Come on, dyson.
Rules are meant to be broken.
Later, kenzi.
Yeah!
How'd that taste, baby?
Looks like you owe me
50 bucks, buddy.
Consider yourself schooled.
Don't play pool with une petite hustler.
Here's my free lesson-
Don't play pool with a siren. was it something I sang?
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, look.
If you're bringing your human act here into fae world,
You'll need to nut up.
Y'all don't play fair.
Right. But in your world, people always do the right thing,
The good side always wins, and the nice guy gets the girl.
And what's your point?
My point is that you have to show people
That you can handle your shit,
That you're more than just the... Sidekick.
I don't give a rat's ass what any of you think,
Only bo.

Left behind again?
You want to shoot some stick?
Sorry, hale.
I got my own shit to solve.
Gettin' better.
Goon-mobile-check. bumbling idiot-check.
Ha ha.
Holy honeypot.
Hey.
Hey, I took too much, didn't I?
No, you took what you had to.
Where is he?
Eddie?
Eddie?
Yeah.
Dyson.
What up, brother?
Hello.
Are you okay?
Never better. So, uh...
What up?
You called me,
Sounded like you were gonna soil yourself.
You said, "he's here."
Yeah, he was.
Lucas?
Yeah, my fellow hsien.
Wanted to know if I'd been
Talking to that succubus.
He really doesn't like you sniffing in his business.
That's okay.
I scared him off, though.
You did?
Yeah.
You know, I've learned some interesting things
In the past few days-
That fae can be bookies,
That body jumpers exist.
That people often have a tell when they're bluffing.
Oh, you think I'm bluffing?
Eddie's not here anymore, is he?
No. Thank god! aah!
Aah! Aah! Bo!
Locked.
Go! I got this!
I know you can only jump bodies
By touching them, lucas,
So come easy or make this hard,
But either way, this is the end of the line.
Aah! is that the best you got, huh?
Oh, I'm just warming up.
Let's dance.
Bring it, juice monkey.
When you're dead, I'm gonna wear your corpse like a coat.
I'm calling p.E.T.A.
I'm gonna rip dyson to itty-bitty pieces,
Using your hands.
Speaking of itty-bitty... mm.
No more bodies within reach.
I pull this trigr,r, you are as dead as the one you are in. what the hell took you so long?
Who paid you to take down mayer?
Where's his money?
Somewhere you'll never find it.
Whatever.
We got all the time in the world,
Unlike you.
I can already smell that corpse starting to rot.
A few more hours, it'll be so decomposed,
You won't be able to stay in it.
If you don't get back to your own body soon, lucas...
You'll be worm food,
Like all of your little human puppets.
Or hey, how about I lock you in one of those body drawers, huh?
It's a hell of a way to spend your final hours.
He forced me into roger's corpse,
Fixed the bet at mayer's,
Said if I didn't trick that old bookie,
I wouldn't get my body back.
"he" who, lucas?
There's gonna be an expensive card game going here tonight.
I want you there.
This is lucas, your body jumper.
He's here to tell us who ripped you off.
He better.
So you gonna let us in?
You, yes. Him, no.
I can't enter without his permission.
We work for different sides.
I don't want him knowing my business.
And I don't want the ash knowing that I was involved in it.
So you both stay quiet.
Everybody wins.
On your blood honor.
Bad peace
Is better than good war.
What's with the meat delivery?
Don't you recognize your good buddy lucas, huh, seymour?
The jig is up.
You?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Can't be. believe it, pal.
Seymour and his buddy hired me.
My real body's in his car.
Stupid corpse jockey.
Ththis wouldn't have happed if you weren't so stupid.
Uh, pot, meet kettle.
Drek fresser!
You never let me do anything.
My sister's only son.
I taught you everything but common sense.
300 years,
Yofifinally grow a backbone, and you can only use it
To usurp your own uncle?!
All I wanted was some respect.
Respect?
You're dead to me.
I guess I'll go collect the body of evidence.
In there? kenzi.
Aah! Really gotta pee.
Please don't tell bo I'm here.
Back in your body, lucas.
Well, that's new.
You're welcome.
And as for you...
What is this, a blind date gone bad, huh?
Yeah, that's right.
Mock the human,
'cause that's not getting old.
None of you take me seriously, okay, except bo,
And I want to keep it that way.
Then I won't mention this little debacle.
All right. Then I won't tell her how much it hurts you
Every time you two are together.
Yeah, I noticed.
But we both know it's worth it.
What, are you back on team dyson?
You wish.
Come on.
We're getting t-shirts. kenzi?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
He texted.
We, uh, we text.
Yeah, you know...
Yeah.
Backup.
Weirdo.
Ah, he's not so bad.
I was talking about you, freak.
So... Seymour, huh?
He's a traitor-
My own flesh and blood.
What are you gonna do with him?
Put him somewhere safe.
What else?
You're more familiar with the light.
My side-
We don't believe in mercy.
He's family.
So you promise not to tell,
I'll let you see the oracle.
"l"let," my balls, buddy.
That was the first deal.
She made good on it.
You want bo to keep your little secret,
That's a whole new shebang.
What do you want?
I'll take the debt.
You never know when I might need to collect on your blood honor.
Ahah, you're not too bad for a succubus.
You're not so bad yourself, considering you're dark fae.
So join us.
I'm not picking sides...
At least, not until I find out about my parents.
Cassie's in the back.
Ooh.
Mmm.
I'd like to feed off you. yeah,
I'd make a bad snack.
I never had much luck.
You taste like a survivor.
Well, if I can't eat you,
Uh, maybe I can use you, if you need a job.
I got a job, but thanks.
Let's do it.
A girl.
Your mother.
Betrayed by the one she loved the most.
But she escaped, after all those years,
Searching, yearning for her child,
For you.
She will be coming.
there will be a battle.
Death.
You will have to choose.
She's coming.
She's coming! Shs s coming!
She's coming!
I'm gonna ralph.
What was that? Because that was not my memory.
No duh.
Do not tell anyone that just happened
What does it mean?
You're a major player.
Fate has some serious plans for you.
Oh.
Later.
So?
Ahem.
It was a long shot.
Maybe it's bettenonot knowing.
Family- it's-it's complicated.
Kenzi...
She's alive.
My mother's alive.
