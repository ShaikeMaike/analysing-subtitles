Why isn't this stupid thing workin?
See, that's that bullshit.
I'm taking this shit right back to Best Buy.
Or not.
Stupid lens cap.
Wow!
Brand-new camera.
I'm filming everything with this.
Christmas, New Year's, vagina.
All right.
Today is the big day.
My girlfriend
Kisha's moving in.
Now, all my boys keep telling me, "Don't do it, don't do it, because everything's gonna change."
"She's gonna take over your house."
"She's never gonna cook again."
"And worst of all, you're putting your dick in jail."
I think they're trippin'.
Once she moves in, everything's gonna be perfect.
Place looks nice.
Baby boy cleaned up for you, huh?
Oh, shit!
Rosa!
Hey, you gotta announce yourself.
You can't just creep up on me.
Aw, come on. This is my housekeeper, Rosa.
Say hi. Say hi.
Say hi!
Hi! Hola.
Say "Hola." Hola.
Bye-bye!
No, no. We gonna say hi the right way.
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!
Do this.
Oh!
I'm a big bambino?
You know I love you.
Hey, Shiloh!
Say hi to Mommy.
I'm gonna hump you on your leg, Kisha.
That's right.
And I'm gonna lick you all over your face with my dog-ball mouth.
Oh, shit.
Here she comes.
Hi, baby!
Hey, baby! Hi!
No, no, Shiloh!
Wait! No, no, no, no!
Shiloh! What did you do?
I didn't see him!
What did you do?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God!
Shiloh, come on, breathe.
Maybe he's just playing dead.
He doesn't know how to play dead.
He knows how to shake hands.
He knows how to fetch.
He knows how to roll over.
He don't know how to play dead.
Come on, Shiloh, breathe.
One, two, three.
Breathe.
Aww!
Give me the jumper cables.
The jumper cables?
Give me the goddamn jumper cables!
Don't you die on me!
Start the car!
Clear! Go!
Oh, shit!
Meet me at the hospital!
The hospital's that way!
Don't go towards the light, Shiloh!
You're in a better place now, buddy.
I'm so, so sorry.
It's okay, baby.
It's... It's not your fault.
Yes, it is.
You know, look...
Look on the bright side.
I'm allergic to dogs.
I know, but that's what was so great about Shiloh.
He was hypoallergenic.
Shiloh!
Oh, my God!
Look at all this shit.
Okay, Malcolm, this is the last box.
What's with the camera?
I'm documenting our lives together.
Say hi.
Hi! Okay. Mmm.
That ass lookin' nice, baby.
Hey, hey. Pan up, pan up.
I see that.
Baby, you are officially a hoarder.
I swear to God, I'm gonna open one of these boxes and find, like, a dead cat and an old baloney sandwich in it.
Ha, ha, ha.
Very funny.
Oh, my God.
Do you need these?
Yes! These are...
For what?
These are good wedding shoes!
One to 10, what are you feeling right now about that?
Um, 8.7.
What do you feel about that?
Nine. Nine.
That's a nine?
Yes.
No, wait! Come on. Come on.
What's this? Hold on.
This is a box that my aunt brought from Kenya.
This is a nine, too.
Oh, my God!
Say it.
Hi, my name is Kisha Davis, and I'm a hoarder.
There's shame.
Oh, wow.
Are these your daddy's ashes?
Yes, Malcolm.
They go where I go.
So, we're gonna have his ghost watching over us?
That's comforting.
Just put him in the other room.
He likes to watch TV.
He's dead.
What's he gonna watch?
American Horror Story?
Okay, babe, these video games, they have to go.
Wait. Leave my video games alone.
They're tacky.
Give me my camera!
Kisha, stop playing.
You're gonna break it.
- I'm not gonna break it.
- Give me my camera!
"Negra?" Did she just call me a nigger?
What? What?
I will lambada your ass!
English! English!
Speak English!
Baby. Baby. Baby!
You know she don't like me, right?
Oh, I know what's going on here.
Are you banging Rosa?
You got some Schwarzenegger stuff going on in here, right?
Really?
Yeah, okay, yeah.
She's pregnant with my love child right now.
Yeah, we're gonna have a nappy-haired baby that speaks perfect Spanish.
Come on. Think about it.
Okay.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Hungry there, buddy?
Mm-hmm.
You're over there eating like the Cookie Monster.
Can I just enjoy my food, please?
Wow. Somebody's crabby.
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired.
I haven't been sleeping well.
I keep hearing these noises.
Scary.
Well, you don't have to be afraid, okay?
'Cause you're living with me now.
And nobody's gonna hurt you on my watch.
Okay?
Okay.
Unless the nigger got a gun.
Then you on your own.
What?
Hey, baby, what you doin?
Well, it's time to put on something a little more comfortable.
Aha! That's what
I'm talkin' about!
Fellas, get out your pen and pads.
We about to give you a sex tutorial.
Let's do this.
Mmm. Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, you got the beat!
Oh! Stop.
Stop. Not yet. Not... Ahh!
You gonna bring a friend there, huh?
Ah. Ah.
Uh-huh? Watch that.
Uh-huh.
Now you get some, yeah.
Watch. Watch.
Ah, taste that.
Look at Daddy. Uh-huh.
Two dogs, one duck.
Get it nasty.
You nasty.
Go home.
I want you by myself. Yeah.
Shh.
Oh. Oh, shit!
That's still hot!
Shut up. Take it.
You just take it.
Take it, take it, take it.
Baby!
Yeah, baby?
I cannot believe this is our first night living together!
Yeah. It's nice, huh?
Uh-huh.
I can't wait to lie next to you.
Oh, me, too.
Gotta go, baby.
It was fun.
Whoo!
Get in.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Here I come!
Okay, honey.
Baby, you are the sexiest woman...
What the hell?
You know, Malcolm, not everybody goes to bed looking like a supermodel.
Apparently not.
You know?
Besides, what is wrong with my outfit?
Nothin', if you lived in a box underneath the freeway.
What?
Come on! Hold the sign up, please?
Can I go to bed?
No, you gotta get the joke first!
Come on.
All right.
Okay, fine.
Okay. I'm ready.
All right. Go ahead.
Spare change?
You stupid!
I love you.
Good night.
God!
How could someone so cute be so stink?
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, really?
Oh, God!
What crawled up your ass and died?
Shit!
Really?
You ain't allowed to move in here and do this shit.
Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm.
Ugh!
Aah!
It's alive! What?
Oh! Oh! Oh, fuck!
Oh!
I heard that.
So, we didn't have sex last night.
Kisha didn't cook, and she killed my dog.
But other than that,
I guess this moving-in thing is gonna be pretty cool.
Malcolm! Malcolm!
What's up?
My keys are on the floor.
Okay.
Malcolm.
What?
Something weird is going on here.
If you mean something weird
Like you farting in your sleep, yes, there is.
No, no.
I think we have a ghost.
A ghost?
Yeah, okay. No, you have a ghost in your ass.
Okay. Come on, really?
I wanna bring a psychic to tell us what's going on.
A psychic?
Ah, come on, Kish.
That's ridiculous.
Look, I'll tell you what's going on, okay?
Some neighborhood kid came in here, stole something out of your purse, and then he left...
No. See, if anyone is stealing anything, it is you-know-who, okay?
Hey, girl!
Okay, we have no idea what she's doing when we're not here.
Why is she always wearing gloves?
Okay, fine.
I'll take care of it.
Guilty.
Hey, I'm Dan the Security Man.
Hey, how you doin?
Nice to meet you.
Oh, whoa! Hey, hey, hey!
What's up?
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't see you back there.
That's my associate, Bob.
Actually, he's my brother.
He's a simple...
I'm his brother, too.
He used to play in the dryer.
We turned it on once.
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, yo, you better back up!
What's the problem?
We're here to install cameras.
Yeah. Not to be filmed on camera.
'Cause I'm doing my own reality show.
Well, I'm not signing anything.
And I can't write.
He can't write.
Blur this out.
Mosaic.
Okay.
What is he doing?
Is the owner home?
You're talking to him.
Yeah, right!
Wow.
Oh. Wow. Okay.
All right. Now, that camera covers your entire backyard.
It's cool.
Let's say you and the missus are having a pool party, right?
You know, you're grilling up some fried chicken, probably some ribs.
Hot wings, some pig knuckle, strimps.
You know, maybe some corn bread.
I'd say watermelon, but that might be racist, right?
Corn bread was pretty close.
Not really. Country folks eat corn bread.
Can I say it?
You talking about the "N" word?
Yeah.
No. It's not appropriate.
I see.
Are you...
Is he serious?
You can call me a cracker.
I don't want to.
I just want...
Let me say it.
If you say it, I'm going to punch you in your face.
Anyway...
Wow.
Maybe later things get a little freaky.
You and the old lady in the
'cuzzi, buck naked, right?
Little Black Mamba's ready to strike.
That camera will catch all of it.
Nice! So, all you gotta do, go upstairs, clickity-clack on the computer, beat off to the highlights.
Yeah.
Holler!
Holler!
Do it.
No.
Holler!
Are you really gonna make me do this here?
Camera Guys.
Holler!
Got you all tied in.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, just hit the space bar, the mouse, you flash from the kitchen.
Mm-hmm?
Entryway.
Backyard.
Living room.
I even tied in the webcam.
Nice.
Yeah. Oh, I like that.
That's cool.
Here's something you wanna think about.
You can remote access these things from wherever you are.
I can set that up if you want.
Just give me your pass code.
No. Not gonna happen.
Good choice.
Nice try.
But you could set that up if you want to.
You're out of town on a business trip, you might wanna check up on the missus, make sure she's safe.
Right.
Or whatever she's doing!
Yeah.
You know, girls, they like to have a girls' time when you're out of town.
And why wouldn't they, you know?
You don't expect things like...
You know, she's spread eagle on the floor, banging the mailman.
"Special delivery!"
Not on our bed!
You dirty bird!
In front of the dog!
Is he serious?
Oh, the dog's so upset!
I mean, you know, you're at a security convention in Albuquerque screaming at the top of your lungs at a Quality Inn!
I remember Albuquerque.
You can't scratch your way through the camera!
Kinda reminds me,
I gotta mail out some bills before the end of the month.
Uh, it's okay, man.
It's okay.
Bobby, you better not be recording.
Uh, Bobby? Yeah, I got the whole thing.
Don't do this shit in my house.
It's okay. Okay.
All right. I understand.
Okay.
Why are you installing all these security cameras anyway?
Uh, we may have a burglar.
Or a ghost.
A burglar.
Ghost.
Burglar.
Ghost!
Well, it just so happens I have my own ghost hunter reality show.
Do you wanna know what it's called?
I got one, too.
Wild guess, American Ghost?
Wrong!
Ghost Guys.
Oh!
It is trademarked, so don't get any funny ideas.
I definitely won't.
All right. See ya.
Yeah! You know they're shooting porn in there.
Really?
No way he owns it.
Malcolm, what is that?
Well, I paid those camera guys all this money and they left a big-ass blind spot inside the hallway.
So you decided to break my fan and rig up this ridiculous camera?
Yep.
Call me "Nigyver."
Wow.
Cool. All right, baby. Come on.
All right.
All right.
- I'm so hungry.
- Me, too. Starving.
Okay, Rosa.
We're leaving.
Buenas tardes, senores.
Okay.
It's crazy, right?
These stupid motherfuckers don't think I speak English!
Hmm.
Yo, I got a nice pool.
You want to come on down?
Yeah, we got a Jacuzzi.
Que pasa?
Ay, Dios mio!
Whoo! ¡Dios mio!
Whoo!
Hey, Rosa. We're back.
Hola!
Ah!
Si!
Yo tambien.
I don't know what you saying.
Mm-hmm!
- Baby!
- What?
Look at how she's swimming.
Hey, Steve. Steve, look.
Check this out.
Black girl don't like getting her hair wet.
Hey, hey, hey!
Malcolm, cut that shit out!
Just got my hair did. You know that.
Don't play with me.
You're looking good over there, baby.
Hey, show us your tits.
What?
Show us your tits!
Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no, no!
I knew she would do it.
You like that?
No, no. That was awkward.
Oh, yeah? But did you like it a little bit?
They're cockeyed.
Yeah, I know. One's bigger than the other one.
That way you can have a favorite.
Baby?
No!
Whoo!
Your head's gonna get pregnant!
Let's do reverse.
Wow, man, I am loving this camera of yours.
This is really cool.
Thanks, man.
Oh, boy.
I bet you're shooting all kinds of extracurricular activities with this camera.
Actually, I'm not.
You aren't?
None.
You're not?
You know, ever since
Kisha moved in,
I haven't seen no parts of the vagina.
No!
It's like she moved in, and her vagina moved out the same day.
You gotta be kidding me!
Yeah.
That makes me angry.
Not as angry as it makes my penis.
Well, I am angry for your penis.
Mr. Happy is not so happy.
Oh, that's infuriating.
Yeah, man.
Yeah, man.
It makes me very upset to hear that.
But you know, there is something you can do to spice it up if you want to.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
What?
Well, you know how, like, if you get tired of driving your car, you might test-drive a new car?
Mm-hmm.
Maybe you would even let somebody else drive your car for a little while, you know?
Get a whole new appreciation of your vehicle when you do that.
Are you talking about swapping girlfriends?
- What? No!
- Excuse me?
Oh, wow!
I don't know where you were goin' with that! Oh, wow!
I was talking about cars!
My bad.
You would never do it?
I would absolutely never do it.
Me neither.
Me neither.
What kind of pervert does that?
That's what you would have to be.
It takes a pervert to swap girlfriends.
You never have done it, and you never would, huh?
No, Steve.
Even if you got drunk enough or something like that?
Like, you might have a few too many drinks and say,
"Why not?
Let's give it a try," if there was a couple that was into it.
No.
No. Yeah, me neither.
That's how I feel.
But even, like, maybe if you got a little high, maybe on a Saturday night or something like that, and you were like...
Even then.
Yeah. Like, even if this couple was, like, up for anything and raring to go, and she was hot to trot, like, a hot, hot lady.
It wouldn't matter.
You wouldn't do it, right?
Nigger, no.
Same here.
We're in agreement.
It's crazy to swap girlfriends like that.
I am with you 100%.
Steve, want a beer?
Thank you very much.
Hey, babe, did you tell Steve we have a ghost?
We don't have a ghost.
A ghost?
Yeah.
Awesome.
I think it'd be cool to have a ghost.
We don't have a ghost.
No, Jenny, it's not cool.
We don't have a ghost.
You thought it was cool in college.
We did a seance and everything!
A seance?
Oh, yeah. That's right.
You did a seance?
Yes.
Honey, it's college.
You do a lot of silly stuff.
Yeah.
Like that time we got drunk and made out.
Oh, it's all hazy.
You know, college, it's like a big fog.
We're gonna talk about these college days.
Yeah, yeah.
A hazy, sexy fog, it sounds like.
Wouldn't it be great if we all spent the night? Together?
Well, that's an interesting idea.
What do you think of that, Malcolm?
- A naked sleepover?
- No.
No?
It's weird.
Yeah, but it's definitely gonna be weird.
But are you saying weird good or weird bad?
Weird bad, Steve.
Okay.
All right, you guys.
It's been real.
Listen, I know a great psychic if you need one.
Okay.
He told me I'd be surrounded by big, black spirits in my near future.
Vaginas crossed.
Yeah, okay.
Right? Goodbye!
Well.
Listen, before we go, I just wanna talk to you about something,
'cause Jenny's got a birthday coming up.
Okay.
I wanna do something real special for her, you know.
I was thinking maybe you could invite a couple of guys over,
Like your cousin Ray-Ray, maybe?
And some of those big, black guys that he hangs out with, you know?
Jamal, and Hakim, and Anforny, you know?
Just the six of us, right?
We'll have some fun.
We'll double stuff the Oreo a little bit, huh?
Dirty up the white snow?
Black poles, white holes.
You know, maybe all pile on the little white rabbit, right, you know?
Are you talking about a mandingo party?
What? A what?
Excuse me!
I mean, I'm really, uh, not into that.
But if you're into that...
Um, I'm...
Well, we might be able to work something out if that's what you're into.
Hey, buddy, I mean...
Okay, bye, Steve.
Oh!
Oh, wow.
That's beautiful.
Okay, Jenny.
All right. Goodbye.
Okay, honey, come on.
Come on, honey, come in.
You're lucky.
She is luckier.
Bye, guys. Bye!
All right.
Okay. All right.
I think Jenny and
Steve are swingers.
You think? Wow.
This looks like a ghetto Rite Aid.
Wrong Aid.
Oh, shit!
Did somebody shave a yeti?
Very funny.
I shaved my legs.
With what, a weed whacker?
Wow. That's like
Apollo Creed's chest hairs.
That is crazy.
Oh! Hey!
Malcolm, come on!
Dude, turn that off.
Get out of here.
You got to close this.
Stop it!
I'm claustrophobic, okay?
Yeah? Well,
I'm ass-trophobic.
You know what, Malcolm?
What?
Love it or leave it, okay?
Here. Here.
Take it, okay?
It's oak-y.
It's... It's full-bodied.
I believe it's open.
Oh, that's...
That's nasty!
Mmm. The aroma.
The nastiest thing ever.
No, Malcolm! Malcolm!
Hey! No!
Move your little nasty foot.
Stop it!
Ow! Ow! Malcolm!
Uh, Malcolm. Malcolm?
Hmm?
The camera isn't off.
Yeah, the camera's off.
What are you talkin' about?
The light is on.
That's the standby light.
That's the record light.
I don't want to be like those stupid girls.
Kim Kardashian with a sex tape.
First of all, Kim Kardashian's worth $150 million.
Think about it, Kisha. You could have your own reality show.
You could have your own clothing line, your own perfume.
"Stank," by Kisha.
No.
Your window of opportunity is closing quickly.
Turn it off.
Oh, God, you are a hater.
I'm not.
Malcolm. You ain't slick.
That camera's still on.
- What?
- "What?"
That's cheap.
Whoo! Whoo!
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.
That was crazy.
Oh, I got a cramp.
I told you we should have recorded that.
I don't think they make 30-second tapes.
Oh, come on. That was at least two minutes, 15, 16 seconds.
Whoo! That was great.
Malcolm, you know we have to go again, right?
I need a halftime.
You gotta talk to the coach.
Get some new plays.
Wake up.
Okay, okay.
Come on now.
Okay, okay.
Woody's sore.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Good morning, honey.
Hi, baby.
Mwah.
Malcolm, I told you to turn the camera off!
I know. I'm shit.
But, baby, I was tearin' it up last night.
Oh, please.
You were all right.
Baby, check this move.
Look at that.
Malcolm, I need you to erase this tape.
I don't wanna end up on the Internet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Rewind the video.
Okay.
Did you see that?
Uh-huh.
See, I call that move the Tornado.
No, stupid!
Look! The door, it moved.
You see?
Oh, wow.
Well, there is a rational explanation for all that.
See, what happens is, with the Tornado, right, the vortex in which I move my hips, especially with a downward motion, it creates that vortex.
I'm surprised the windows didn't blow open.
You are stupid.
Sometimes it does that.
See, I'm working on a whole natural disaster theme for me and you.
We gonna start with the Mudslide tonight.
Or the Earthquake.
Earthquake is crazy!
'Cause I just get in and I shake up in there, fast as I can. I just shake.
Malcolm!
Malcolm, come here, please!
Quick! What happened?
What happened?
Okay, so the glass was on the counter, and then it...
Something knocked it off!
How do you explain that?
Well, maybe you put it on the edge of the counter, and it just slipped off.
Last night, it was the door, Malcolm.
And then, this morning, the pot was on the floor.
Maybe it wasn't put on the rack properly.
All right, I'll take credit for that.
Lord knows you don't cook.
Oh, I love you, but stop.
Be careful.
You're gonna get glass in your foot and be trackin' blood all through the house
Like Bruce Willis in Die Hard.
Do you believe me now, Malcolm? Hmm?
Maybe it was your vortex.
Oh, God.
Did you hear that?
Nope.
What?
What about that?
That was just the house settling.
No big thing.
Just go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep?
The wind?
What?
Negro, the windows are closed!
Oh, hell, no! I'm out!
What? Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Really?
Oh, hell, no.
Malcolm, what are you doing?
Bitch, there is a ghost in the house. I'm out.
You can't leave.
You watch me.
Deuces.
Malcolm!
You all right?
Who am I kidding?
I can't sell a house in this market.
"Immediate possession."
It's already possessed!
Hi, Chip. I'm Kisha. Hi.
Hi, I'm Chip the Psychic.
Come on in.
Nice. Nice.
Oh!
And you...
You must be Malcolm.
Mmm, yeah. That's pretty good.
How did you know?
Uh, psychic.
See?
I have a lot of powers all over my body.
Do you... You play basketball, probably, a little bit, right?
No, not really.
You don't?
No. Well, you got the body for it.
You're lucky.
You're a lucky, lucky lady.
I'm gonna ask you some questions.
You know, nothing cray.
Just real simple stuff.
Okay, how long have you guys been together?
Two years.
Yes.
Okay, Malcolm, are you happy?
Yes.
Do you like living with her?
Yes.
Have you been with a man? No.
Did you have a good Halloween?
Yes.
Did you have a good Christmas?
Yes.
Do you like movies?
Yeah.
Have you been with a man?
Yeah...
No. What? No!
Did you have a good Easter? Yes.
Do you like booze?
Yes.
Do you eat food every day? Yes.
Have you been with a man?
Yes. No, no!
I've never been with a man.
Okay, I'm just asking 'cause I'm just trying to get to know you.
I've never been with a man.
I've never been with a man.
I've never been with a man.
Would you stop being so...
I've never been with a man!
Okay!
You don't have to be loud and angry.
I've never been with a man!
He keeps asking me if
I've been with a man!
I've never been with a man!
Okay.
I'm trying to get to know you.
Have you been with a man?
I sleep on this side of the bed.
Right.
She sleeps there.
Ick.
And, you know, we keep the camera right there.
And one night, we saw the door kind of just, like...
Oh, wow. So there was some paranormal over there.
No, she thinks it's paranormal, and I think it's
'cause of the Tornado.
'Cause I created a vortex.
What does that mean?
We was havin' sex, and I was hittin' it.
I was like...
I was doing this round, and I think the...
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, sorry.
You all right?
I got light-headed there for a second.
Okay. All right.
Yeah, no, I'm good.
Check out the door.
You know what?
There is some dark energy over here.
Really?
Yeah. Wow, that's crazy.
I didn't even... Oh!
We got a ghost.
Oh, my God, it's got me!
It's got me!
It's got me!
It's got me!
Help! Help!
Hey, man!
Get off of me!
Oh, man!
Get off of me.
What are you doing?
I don't know what just happened.
That was so scary.
Okay, you guys. This is a simple channeling exercise.
Okay.
This is creepy.
Shh.
All right, Kisha, now just breathe.
Relax.
Do you feel anything?
No, not really.
What about you, Malcolm?
Just your dick in my back.
Well, that's a start.
Now, there are two kinds of paranormal entities.
I specialize in the good ones.
Okay, yeah, like
Casper the Friendly Ghost.
Oh!
Yeah, he's fun.
And also Patrick Swayze from Ghost.
I love that movie.
Yes, that one was really moving.
Especially with the clay, and he'd work the clay and just...
And he just fuckin' has it, and...
Demons, though, are bad.
Those are pure, pure, pure evil.
And they will pop up at the worst possible times.
You know, like herpes.
What?
What are you looking at me for?
All I'm saying is, do not aggravate a demon.
Do not try to contact them, and whatever you do, do not film them.
That will only make things worse.
See? Don't film demons.
Very bad.
Okay.
Well, thanks a lot for coming out, man.
Is there anything you wanna get off your chest?
No, I'm good.
Is there anything you want to put on my chest?
Huh? Wait'll you see the clay scene.
Wait, wait. Uh...
I have a confession to make.
Yep, herpes!
I knew it.
Oh! Ick!
No, I don't!
But did I mention that I made a deal with the devil for a pair of really cool Louboutins?
You made a deal with the devil for a pair of shoes?
Not shoes, Malcolm!
Louboutins, okay?
They've got red soles, and they make my calves pop!
Well, I really needed them, okay?
You are screwed, sista, with an "A."
This demon is not leaving this house until it gets what it wants.
What's that?
Kisha.
You're fine, Malcolm.
Like, you're free to be whoever you want.
It's a five-man wrestling league.
I'm good.
It's so fun.
I bet it is.
It's not for me.
And everyone's really good.
Really?
Yeah, no, but it's competitive.
It's something that...
Oh, my God.
I'm getting mind powers.
Okay. All right.
I'm getting mind powers.
Malcolm, something is going to happen to you that is going to change you.
Don't fight it.
Whatever it is, don't fight it, okay?
Okay, I won't. I won't.
I can save you.
It's five guys.
We wrestle on Monday.
Okay.
I can save you.
No, thank you.
Save you!
God.
I think that went well.
We need to talk.
A demon, Kisha?
I'm sorry, Malcolm.
Why... Why didn't you tell me this, like, on the first date?
Because you never would have gone out with me again.
Exactly!
How long has this been happening to you?
Since I was a little kid.
What the shit is this?
And you say I tape everything.
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.
Happy birthday, Kisha.
Mama loves you.
Ooh! To think you almost didn't make it.
But good thing that clinic was closed.
Ooh! God is good all the time.
You are eight years old.
Enjoy your birthday.
Sooner or later, you're gonna come home from school one day.
"Where's stepdaddy?
Where's stepdaddy?"
And I'm gonna be gone.
Happy birthday, Kisha.
Make a wish.
Sit right there.
All right.
Happy birthday to me.
I wish Tony can stay with me forever.
Who is Tony?
Who is Tony, baby?
He's my friend.
If you have friends, they'd all be
gathered around here drinking beer,
smoking cigarettes, having a good time,
gambling, playing cards and stuff.
She talking about her invisible friend.
I guess we should be nice about it.
You gonna blow it out? Or you just gonna look at us crazy?
Dang.
She ain't all there.
Why is she looking at me like that?
Lookin' all crazy.
You crazy.
Look, look, look, look, look.
She got a lazy eye.
Blow them damn candles out.
Blow 'em out. I wanna get her blowing out the candles.
I know what I'm doing, woman.
Do not yell at me.
Blow out the candles, baby.
Tony, no!
You wanna throw cake on my brand-new Betamax?
You must be crazy!
Ow! It wasn't me.
It was Tony.
I'm-a beat the Tony out of you then.
Ah, ah, ah.
Lamar, not so hard.
You're gonna break your new belt.
This is how you beat a stepchild.
I won't beat my own kids like this.
I know that's right.
Anything else you wanna tell me?
Well, about the herpes.
Baby, what are you doing?
Huh?
Oh, nothing. I'm just...
Just cleaning, that's all.
You ever get that not-so-fresh feeling?
Seriously, Malcolm?
Seriously, we're gonna have to talk about your lies.
Oh, that's fizzing.
It's fizzing.
It's herpes, Kisha.
This ain't a cold sore, Kisha.
This is the real thing.
Ah! You did this to me.
Get a match!
Get the goddamn match!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
That hurt. Whoa!
What the hell?
What happened?
Did...
What'd you slap me for?
Was I snoring?
Kisha!
Kisha!
The hell?
Kisha.
Kisha.
What the hell?
Kisha.
Oh, shit!
Kisha, what the...
Kisha, what are you doing?
What? Oh, that is gross.
Wait! No, baby, that milk is three weeks old.
Oh! Baby.
Baby, what are you doing?
I'll run to the store.
We're out of milk.
I'll be right back.
No, no, you... No, no.
Give me that.
Honey, honey.
Where do you keep the Pepto?
Oh, man.
Where do you keep the Pepto?
My stomach hurts.
What are you doing?
I'm looking at the tape from last night.
Honey, you make me feel good.
Okay. Maybe some sleep will make you feel good.
Oh, my God.
I don't remember doing any of this.
What am I doing?
Acting like a freak.
This is crazy.
Wait, look at this.
Check this out.
Something weird...
Weird-weird-weird is going on.
Something weird is going on.
Meow. Honey, you make me feel good.
Weird is going on.
Weird is going on.
Weird-weird-weird is going on.
Whoo!
Weird-weird-weird-weird is going on.
I'm a scary ghost!
I can't breathe.
Baby, you mad?
Baby.
Malcolm!
It's not a joke!
Come on. I'm just trying to make light of a bad situation.
Bad situation? So, what, now you're referring to my moving in as a bad situation?
I didn't have a demon in my house till you moved in.
What happened to, "You're living with me now.
I'll protect you"?
From a burglar, not a ghost!
You know what?
I ain't listening to this.
Where do you think you're going?
Out.
Oh, okay! So you're just gonna leave me here alone?
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Okay, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!
What, what, what, what?
Look at this!
Oh, wow. What the...
Oh, Daddy!
Malcolm!
Oh, shit.
What kind of monster would do this?
Uh, uh, baby, you were right.
Listen, there is an evil spirit in this house.
I believe you.
I was so dumb.
I can't believe
I didn't believe.
Oh, shit. I feel it. Oh, my God.
It's right there.
You feel that?
Feel it, feel it, feel it.
It's cold, right? Oh, my God!
Baby, we have to get rid of this menace once and for all.
Ooh! The tape!
We can watch the tape.
Wait, no! No, no, no.
Don't watch the tape.
Don't watch the tape.
What?
Because it's just me and you against him.
You evil spirit!
You leave this house alone!
Now!
You hear me?
You get out!
Get out, demon.
Get out!
Get out, get out, get out!
See, I believe you.
No.
I need you to shut up once and for all.
Let's watch the tape.
I am shutting up! God!
Mm-hmm.
Hi, Daddy.
You want to come in here and move in on my house? Huh?
You like haunting people, huh?
I ain't scared of you.
Uh, baby? Um...
Fuck you, and fuck your daddy!
This is disturbing.
You don't want to see it.
I will break your arm.
You wanna watch TV?
Wow!
Oh. Oh, my.
See, that hurt. Lookee.
I got a boo-boo, baby, right...
I don't care.
Oh!
On my father's ashes!
Really?
You think you the shit?
I'll show you the shit.
Nasty! That is so nasty.
I will...
On the floor? Really?
So, what did you do, wipe your ass with the curtains?
Baby, you didn't like the curtains anyway.
You're an animal.
We'll get new curtains.
It's just curtains.
I'd be an animal if I didn't wipe at all. Baby!
This isn't gonna prove any...
Yes, it is!
I swear that I will listen to Kisha whenever she says strange things are going on in the house.
And?
And...
And I swear that I won't antagonize the ghost anymore.
Even though I didn't bring him in the house.
And?
And I swear that
Kisha is the prettiest and the sexiest girl for never.
And?
And I promise I won't shit in your daddy's ashes.
Louder!
I promise I won't shit on Kisha's daddy's ashes ever again.
Happy?
Yes.
Can I have my video game back now?
No!
See, man?
Why are you putting powder on the floor?
See, the powder is gonna let me see his footprints.
And you think this is gonna work.
It did on Scooby-Doo.
Malcolm, did you hear that?
Mm-hmm.
Then why are you pretending to be asleep?
'Cause I know if I'm up, you're gonna make me go check out where them scary-ass noises are coming from.
Get your black ass up.
See, man?
Kisha.
Camera. Get the camera.
Get the camera.
Whose plan was stupid now, Kisha? Hmm?
Pass me a bat.
A bat?
You're gonna use a bat on a ghost?
I'm sorry. I left my proton pack in the car.
Pass me the bat.
This ghost's got some ugly-ass feet.
Looks more like an alien.
I don't wanna do it.
I don't wanna do it.
I can't do it. I can't do it.
What?
Malcolm!
No, this... No.
This ain't what we do.
This is for white people.
Will you grow some balls!
This is for white people.
This ain't what niggers do.
We don't investigate.
We run. We run, we live.
If we was in a movie theater, some black woman be screaming,
"Don't do it!
Don't do it, boy!"
"He behind there.
He in there."
If we know he's in there, why the fuck are we going in there?
Come on, baby.
I don't want to do it.
Stop it.
What if it bites me?
It's not a zombie.
It's a ghost.
You wanna play?
That's right!
You hurt my mother.
You killed my mother.
That's right!
That's not helping.
It's not helping none.
You got this. Go.
You want some of this?
This is how we...
Get him!
Bust your...
Whoop that ghost's ass!
Turn on the lights!
Oh, my God! Rosa?
Rosa? Rosa! Rosa!
Si, senor! Que pasa?
Oh, my... I'm so sorry.
I thought you...
I... I didn't know.
I thought you was a ghost.
- Ghost?
- Or an alien.
I was talking about your feet, not your citizenship or lack thereof.
I quit.
See? Give me the camera!
Go fix this.
No! I'm not fixing nothing!
Oh, can't believe Rosa quit.
Yeah, well, you know, this is stressful on all of us.
I think I might have a little something to help alleviate some of that stress.
Take it. You hit it.
Yeah?
Now you gonna go spit up the end and shit.
Hold it, hold it.
Damn!
Yay! Bravo.
Encore, encore.
I see a face in the chip.
It's got a mustache.
You're not moving...
Never get high.
...fast enough, Malcolm.
Never get high with people that don't know how to get high.
I'm baked.
Oh, shit.
Los Angeles County, 911.
My dick!
He fell for it!
No, I don't want to.
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.
Yeah! That's a shotgun for your ass.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Is he gone?
Oh, he's gone.
Wow!
That's that Criss Angel shit right there.
Yo, that ghost good.
That ghost good.
That ghost good.
That ghost good.
Oh, my God.
What?
That was awesome!
Disgusting!
Malcolm, wake up.
Mmm?
You peed the bed.
What?
You peed the bed.
Oh, shit! Oh!
Oh, that's...
That's not funny.
Oh, that's fucked up.
That's real fucked up.
Hey, Steve, thanks a lot for bringing the Ouija board over, man.
I really appreciate that.
Oh, no worries, bro.
- Hopefully...
- Hey, baby.
Can you grab the wine?
Oh, hey, Kisha, the dinner was so amazing.
The chicken was unbelievably tender and real juicy.
Oh, well, actually, that was all Malcolm.
Was it now?
I'll be damned.
Well, thanks for letting me nibble on the leg because I love dark meat.
Mmm. Well, that is true.
She eats it up.
I bet she does.
She eats it all up.
Yeah.
You guys are gonna love this wine.
It is a very robust red.
Yum.
Well, you know what they say.
"The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice."
Mm-hmm.
Okay, y'all need to cut this out.
Well, you know what? Normally, we don't have to chase this hard.
Mm-hmm.
Steve...
Hmm?
I was talking about that stupid board.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Baby, I just want to communicate with it.
Are you a ghost or a demon?
Who's doing that? Malcolm.
Who's doing that?
I don't know. It's not me.
I swear to God.
"G."
You guys.
"O."
Steve, are you pushing this?
I'm not doing anything.
Oh, what? "S."
Go where...
"T."
A "gost?" What the hell is a "gost"?
Oh, maybe he's trying to spell "ghost."
Are you trying to spell "ghost"?
You're doing that?
No. I'm not moving it, I swear.
"Yes."
Wait. So, he just spelled "ghost" "gost."
What kind of illiterate, bitch-ass ghost is this?
Please. Can you please use "gost" in a sentence?
Yeah, right.
Up yours, you stupid "gost."
He probably dyslexic, too.
He probably spells "boo," O-O-B.
Ooh!
Oh.
Oh.
Whoa, whoa!
Somebody's sensitive.
And stupid.
You know what? I think we'll probably just show ourselves out.
Good morning, honey.
Good morning.
Mmm.
Hey.
Mmm.
Well, all right.
Baby, that is the best night's sleep I've had since I moved in.
Well, maybe because you made me sleep in the other room.
What are you talking about?
We had a breakthrough last night.
A breakthrough? Really?
Yes, Malcolm.
The way that you touched me, caressed me, made love to me.
What are you talking about?
Malcolm, we had sex last night!
No, we didn't.
Yes, we did.
For about two hours!
Uh, that definitely wasn't me.
Well, who else could it have been?
No, get off of me!
Oh, my God.
Mmm.
Mmm, Malcolm.
What?
Ooh, that's new.
Oh.
Are you doing the alphabet?
Uh-uh, nigger, clean your plate.
Come on.
Slob it down, slob it down.
Waterboarding your ass.
Mm, Malcolm.
Did you grow?
Ride the pony! Ride it. Oh!
Oh! Get it! Get it! Get it!
Oh, I've had it.
Oh, yeah! Dip it!
Dip it down!
I can't watch.
Why don't I finish up...
I can't watch anymore.
I just can't watch anymore.
I'll finish.
Uh-uh, you ain't done yet.
I had no idea you was a squirter.
Neither did I?
Hey.
Don't touch me.
You seriously have an attitude with me right now?
You liked it.
What?
You heard me.
You liked it.
You like having sex with that thing more than you like having sex with me.
Malcolm, I was asleep.
Mm-hmm. Talk to the hand.
I was...
That's the hand.
Talk to it.
I was asleep, okay?
I didn't know I was having sex with a ghost.
Aha!
You just admitted to having sex with a ghost!
And you liked it!
"Oh, Malcolm, you grew."
What happened, Kisha?
I'm not adequate enough for you?
Huh? I'm sorry.
I tried Extense, Kisha.
Went through the whole program.
I did Cialis, Viagra and Maca.
Okay. All it did was get me dizzy, you know...
Okay, stop it, all right?
That is not fair!
I was anally bleeding for a month, and you didn't even know.
Listen, that is not fair, because I'm the one who was violated, not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Must have been a horrific experience for you.
I'm sorry.
Eh, could have been worse.
Hey, cuz... Ray-Ray.
You got a beef up in here?
Lots of niggers.
Not beef. Hey...
Hey, what the fuck is you taping for, Kisha?
We thugs.
We can't be on no TV!
Shut up, Ray-Ray.
Get the fuck off me.
Okay. Sorry.
So, what's going on with this beef, homey?
It's that old bitch next door, ain't it, homey?
Yeah, she was eyeballing me, cuz, when I was all up in her windowsill last night.
But she got a nice body, though, cuz.
You know, like a sexy-ass baked potato, homey.
It's not like that.
What the fuck is it like, then, homey?
Well, someone's coming between me and Kisha.
Somebody fucked your girl, cuz?
Well, not... I be the one that fucked your girl!
Oh, please.
How you let somebody fuck your girl before me, cuz?
We family, nigger!
I... I'm sorry... Kinda.
How the fuck do you "kinda" bang Kisha, homey?
Did he have one pant leg in, one pant leg out?
Like, he wasn't even interested in fucking her, homey?
Like, he had somewhere better to be, homey?
Okay, Ray-Ray, that is not what it's like.
And can you please tell your Negro to back the hell up off me?
Hey! Pelvis back
2 inches, homey.
But stay up on her, though.
What the fuck is it like then, Kisha? Hmm?
If you listen, I'll tell you.
You tell me!
I can't wait to get my hands on this fool.
- Come on out, cuz!
Ray-Ray, cut it out.
You're gonna make it mad.
I don't give a fuck, Kisha!
He should be worried about making
Ray-Ray mad up in here, bitch!
Who you callin' a bitch?
Show yourself!
No, Ray, don't do that!
Don't...
What the fuck is that?
A ghost, Ray.
A "ghost" ghost?
A "ghost" ghost.
Like a dead ghost?
Yes! Ray-Ray, that's what we've been trying to tell you for 15 minutes!
You idiot.
What the...
What in the hell...
What happened to your furniture, cuz?
Get your hands up, cuz!
You're trying to get me killed, cuz.
I didn't, Ray-Ray! Ray!
God!
My stuff!
Babe, you got to admit, it's kind of impressive.
Perfume? Hey!
Yeah, it's new.
It's called Entity.
I like it.
What's the occasion?
What's up?
Malcolm, is it a crime to want to sleep with no panties on?
I get it. This...
This ain't for me.
This is for him.
Who are you talking about?
You know exactly who I'm talking about.
For your little supernatural lover.
Malcolm, you're being ridiculous, and I'm gonna say this right now.
Insecurity is not attractive.
Yeah? Well, being a paranormal jump-off is not attractive either, hon.
Good night.
You're taking this too far.
Whatever.
I have no interest in a ghost.
You gonna try and contact him?
Good night!
I was gonna...
Good night!
Get off of me!
Baby.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey.
What's...
What's up with the donut?
Oh, uh, I just got a little hemorrhoid, that's all.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hurts.
So, anything happen eventful last night?
No, nothing eventful.
Just, you know, the usual.
Just, like, you know, door slams, stuff like that.
Oh. I wanna see.
Nope, nope.
Nothing for you to see, baby.
Wait! Baby!
Hey!
Can you... So rude!
Stop! Stop!
Hey! Malcolm!
Would you...
Cut it...
Just gotta do...
Oh, my!
You know what?
You...
You got altar-boyed.
You know what?
You can't...
Malcolm, hold on a second.
No, no, no, no, no!
You just uploaded it!
No, no, no!
Oh, no!
You're gonna be bigger than
Charlie Bit My Finger.
Say hello to the camera.
Hello, Malcolm...
Come on, Kisha.
Get the camera out my face.
I'm not in the mood. Stop it!
Oh, I see. I see.
Now that you've been touched by an angel, suddenly you're camera shy?
Let me ask you a question, Kisha.
Is this the first ghost you slept with?
Or it's the first one
I caught you with?
You wanna go there?
Yeah, I wanna go there.
When did you become ghost pussy?
You know what, Malcolm?
Maybe I wouldn't need a ghost if I was with a real man!
There are Super Bowl ads that last longer than you do!
Let me tell you something.
People wait all year for those Super Bowl ads, baby.
All year!
And maybe it's 'cause every time I see you naked, all I can think about is you sitting on the toilet, playing with a Rubik's Cube!
I'm sorry, Kisha. Some things just shouldn't be shared.
I let my guard down and...
Oh, you let your guard down.
...you're gonna throw it back in my face?
You killed my dog!
You have not let this go!
Yeah, let's go there.
I did not kill your dog!
You dog murderer.
That was my baby, and you killed it on purpose!
Oh, your baby was 87 years old!
Shh.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, come on.
Let's go outside.
Okay. Okay.
Come on.
Okay. Go!
Okay.
Do you see that?
It's getting worse.
Well, you heard the psychic, all right?
It feeds off of negative energy.
All of your arguing is making it stronger.
My arguing? My arguing?
You're the one that...
That's right.
We have to stop fighting.
I can't.
You are getting on my nerves.
Well, just pretend.
Good thing we switched to plastic.
We'll have to get that pot rack looked at.
Mm-hmm.
Tea's ready.
Mmm.
I'm gonna make a run to Starbucks.
Can you pick me up a latte?
You got it!
Malcolm!
Yeah! I kicked you in your ghost balls!
I got some for you...
Malcolm!
Wake up!
Nigger, open your eyes!
Take off those damn headphones!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Yeah, listen.
Something's wrong with Kisha.
No, no, she's been cleaning all morning.
Dude, Kisha don't clean.
That's good, baby. Not the couch, honey!
Not the couch.
Not the couch.
Yes, the floor.
Yeah, good girl, good girl.
Yo, man, earlier,
I caught her masturbating with a crucifix.
Kisha?
Wouldn't you rather use this?
Okay.
Exactly. I'm...
Uh, dude, I gotta go.
No, she's walking the dog.
What's wrong with that?
The dog is dead.
I gotta go.
Uh, Kisha?
Kisha. Oh, boy. Kisha!
Kisha? Baby?
Listen, I just wanted to apologize for the way I been acting.
I just want to tell you that I love you, and I don't want anything to come between us.
And what the hell is that
Twilight shit on your neck?
Oh, my God! Oh, God!
What the hell?
Oh, yeah.
She is definitely on the rag.
Oh, Father.
Thank God you could make it.
Nigger, call me "Doug."
I don't like being called "Father." No way.
Plus, I got a couple issues with a few people out there claiming false child support.
I mean, just 'cause the little nigger got my eyes, my nose, my extremely rare
AB-negative blood type, don't mean I'm the damn daddy.
Plus, I'm still in training.
At the seminary?
No, the penitentiary.
What?
Shit, nigger,
I've been incarcerated 15 years.
Oh. But you learn a lot out there reading on the yard.
You shank a nigger, come in, read the scripture.
Shank a motherfucker, read the scripture.
You gonna let a nigger in or what?
Uh, I'm sorry, Father.
Come in.
Damn. Standing out here, nigger.
It's cold as hell.
Ooh.
Uh, bro, I'm gonna have to level with you.
This bitch don't look right.
I mean, she look all ashy and shit, and just...
You know, like E.T. with a weave.
If I was you, I'd just be out.
Let's just go.
Come on. Let's go.
Uh, I... I can't leave her.
That's my girl.
Are you kidding me?
Come on, man.
There's so much pussy in the world, man.
You don't have to be with just her.
Come to the congregation.
I've got a few in the congregation,
I'm trying to tell you.
Check this out.
Now, I know she look old.
I know she... But she a freak, and she got skills.
Can we go in there and just save her?
Yo! Yo, dawg, you yelling at me right now?
I know you just didn't scream on me, dawg.
I'm here to exorcise your bitch, man.
So you wanna go in the room.
All the way in?
Look at her hair.
Her hair's all crazy.
You think I'm scared right now, but I'm not.
I didn't think you was scared.
No, I'm just a little concerned that I don't have the right stuff.
Do you have, like, a loaded gun?
I'll shank this bitch for you.
It's cold as a motherfucker in here, man.
Y'all ain't got no heat?
How you doing, crazy bitch?
Kisha.
Kisha, I'm Father Doug.
I'm here to un-possess you.
Wait a minute.
She's moving.
This is some crazy-ass shit, man.
Who are you?
I wasn't expecting her to talk.
I'm Father Doug.
Connect the cut.
Connect the cut.
Connect the cut. Connect the cut.
Connect the cut.
Oh, oh, that's some of that
Busta Rhymes shit she doin' right there.
She's on that Bus A Bus.
It's kinda more like Twista, though.
It's real fast.
Do you know how to connect the cuts?
Uh, uh, uh.
Tic-tac-toe in your face!
Straight X's, straight across, diagonal.
I almost had your ass the other way.
Tic-tac-toe on your arm, connect the cuts.
That's what she was saying,
"Connect the cuts."
I wanna show you something.
"Suck it." That's gangsta!
That's gangsta.
You wanna see mine?
It's okay.
I'm gonna show you mine.
Check this out. I did a little something a while back.
I did that in prison.
Yeah, you know, it hurt. But, you know, you gotta go through it.
You gotta earn it.
Everybody went crazy.
They was like,
"No, you didn't!
You so hard, dawg!"
I had control of that TV for a month.
Would you like to see my paintings?
Sure. Of course.
You know, I consider myself a bit of an art aficionado.
I think it's going well.
It's going good.
Mm-hmm.
If, uh...
Well, you know, if I can be perfectly honest with you, it's your technique that's sloppy.
But that's, you know, to be expected from someone that's possessed.
Hmm?
Ah!
Damn, that made my breath stink.
Man, that breath is kickin'!
I can only imagine what the kitty smell like.
Pure evil.
Goddamn.
I'm Dan "the Man" Kearney and today on Ghost Guys we're investigating paranormal activity at the Johnson residence in suburban Los Angeles.
This is going be very unsettling.
Not like those other fake ghost hunter shows.
This stuff is real.
And I don't mean like,
"I saw my dead nana" scary, but scary like, "I left a bag of meth in the glove box and I'm getting pulled up by the cops and I got a hot pipe under the seat."
That kind of scary.
Let's go inside.
All right, on behalf of Ghost Guys, the greatest ghost-hunter show on the Internet or cable access,
I'd like to thank you for having us.
You've made a good choice.
You're welcome. Thank you very much for coming.
Malcolm, Malcolm,
I'm not sure about this.
I mean, this guy, sure. But Sling
Blade there, don't trust him.
You said you needed ghost hunters right?
I also said I needed a psychic.
Chip, hey, what's up?
What's going on?
What are you doing here?
I'm a psychic, I sensed you needed my help.
I do.
There's a new person.
Yeah, that's Bob.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, there's something different about you.
Something new.
I can't quite put my finger in you.
On you. On it.
Haircut.
Someone's got a secret.
No, I don't. Come on.
Hey, guys.
Gentlemen, what we have here is a crazy bitch.
Now, I would leave her possessed ass in the alley downtown if it was me, but apparently, Malcolm's got a thing for the freak.
Holy shit.
So, what you're saying is, there's an actual demon here in the house?
It's in the bitch.
I'm sorry, "ho."
No disrespect.
"Bitch" is fine.
"Bitch" is fine.
All right, this is what I'm getting.
The entity does not want to leave this house, okay?
It's struggling to stay inside.
And Malcolm, I need to know.
How far are you gonna go to get this demon out?
I'll do anything.
Anything?
I don't see how this is gonna help anything.
This just got weird.
What is this supposed to do?
Um... Nothing. I was just trying to see how far you would go.
What did I tell you?
I think she looks fine.
Clearly does not look fine.
She looks fucked up.
I'm gonna need my Bible.
You're gonna bless her?
Well, yeah, I blessed this joint.
Mm-hmm.
Right out of the First Chronicles.
I haven't done many exorcisms, but
I don't think that's appropriate.
I get it, I get it. I can fix that, though, right now.
I got a little something.
What's going on?
That's a demon party.
Yeah, look out.
What is this, 1985?
Is there just one demon?
'Cause I feel like we could exorcise any demons in the area.
What? I'll take on a whole team of demons.
What we should do is get all the demons in one room and get rid of them all at once.
Do a collective demon-gathering.
We just walk up to people's doors,
"How you doing?
How you doing?"
"Can we talk to you about the Lord today?"
"We heard y'all got demons up in there.
What's up?"
Can I get in the bed with your girl?
I used to braid hair. I could actually braid her hair right now.
I'll be hitting her with some
Allen Iversons and stuff.
I'll give her some Sprewells.
I'll take it back.
Let's do a little exorcism.
All right, "Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness."
"For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children."
"And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you!"
Did you just quote
Sam Jackson in Pulp Fiction?
You got that. You got me on that.
You got me on that one!
I love Sam Jackson, dawg.
The Jheri curl will be dripping and everything.
Plus, on the plane movie.
When he was on the plane and he killed the snakes.
That's my favorite movie.
"Enough is enough!"
"I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!"
Hey, all right! That's what I'm talking about.
Guys!
All right, all right!
Exorcism. That's what we're here for, right?
Yes, go back to the thing that got us here in the first place.
Where we met.
My man!
By the powers vested to me, that somebody gave me while I was locked up, from the correctional institution in Lompoc, that's up north...
I want the demon that's in you to come out and holler at a brother.
Demon, come up out of Kisha, demon.
Come out!
Just come out!
Come up out of Kisha!
Come up out of there, demon.
Come out! Come out!
Come out!
Come out!
Hey! I'm not the one with the demon, she is.
We all have demons, Malcolm.
I know what you did last summer.
You better not do this.
Let her go, she's fat.
Kisha! Kisha!
Kisha! Oh, my God.
Kisha?
Kisha?
Oh, hey, buddy, you made it.
Grab a finger sandwich, they're delish!
About time you came up in here.
'Cause there ain't no party like a mandingo party.
'Cause a mandingo party don't stop.
Drink up, sweetheart.
You need some water?
Mmm.
You're next, Malcolm.
Where are you going?
Hey, don't let her down.
It's her birthday.
Oh, God.
Hey, did you find Kisha?
Uh, no, she's not in there.
You sure?
What's going on in there?
Uh, nothing at all.
Is that a mandingo party?
No.
Man, I wanna get my Kunta Kinte on.
Kisha?
Kisha?
Oh, shit!
Baby?
Oh, my God!
What did you do?
Shit, I did you a favor.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Rosa!
I just wanted my last check, Malcolm.
Oh, my God, you shot my housekeeper.
You mean, your ex-housekeeper.
Look, man, the bitch can't be jumping out on me like that.
You ain't gonna tell nobody, right?
I got warrants.
Hurry, she's in here.
Come on, guys.
Kisha!
We got her cornered.
Baby.
Father, do something.
Oh, my God!
Man, that demon is a freak.
Yeah, the crazy ones always got the best pussy.
The moon landing was fake.
What?
Biggie and Tupac are alive.
Paul Ryan will be the next president.
The demon lies.
Well, except for the thing about Tupac.
He is alive. He's got a new album coming out.
What the fuck is going on here?
There's an exorcism happening, people!
The power of Christ compels you.
The power of
Christ compels you.
What is that, holy water?
No, it's a new cologne from
Khloe and Lamar. It's unisex.
I can smell Lamar.
Get her!
Baby!
Oh! She knows some of that Spider-Man shit!
Oh, my God!
It's got me!
Chip!
I'm afraid of the dark.
Why do have your hand on my balls?
I'm protecting them from spirits.
Get off of me!
There she is!
She's going to the basement.
Bobby? Oh, my God!
Bobby, my brother's gone!
Oh, my God! Let's go!
- Bobby?
- Bobby?
Bobby?
This is dark. I don't wanna go down here.
Kisha! Look at all these weird markings.
Kisha was here.
She has a sign.
Bobby!
Oh, my God! She got Bobby!
Actually, that's just Bobby taking a pee.
What?
Oh, come on, that's gross.
Kisha!
Kisha.
Kisha.
Show yourself.
Baby? Come on, you gotta stay close.
What is this, a Shake
Weight and a Thighmaster?
Nice.
Back the train up.
You got a Flowbee?
Hey, it all looks good at 2:00 in the morning, okay?
Hey, look, Malcolm, one's white and one's black.
- Guess which one you are.
- Black one.
What the hell? Can we just go find my girl, please?
Thank you.
Kisha!
Bobby!
Would you shut the fuck up?
What are you doing?
Come on.
Go, go, go.
What was that?
Christ, that bitch is scary.
I dropped the camera!
Fellas?
Kisha.
Malcolm? Malcolm?
It's me, Chip the Psychic.
Malcolm?
It's me, Chip.
Yoo-hoo.
Okay, I found the camera.
What are you guys doing?
This shit is real, son.
Yeah.
Chip, why are you naked?
What the hell?
Hey!
It got really hot in here.
Oh, no. Where's Bobby?
Found my Walkman.
Kisha? Baby, are you okay?
Leave her alone.
Don't touch her.
Why?
'Cause she's like that witch in Left 4 Dead sitting in the corner crying like that.
You touch her, she gonna attack your ass.
I can't just leave her, man.
Kisha? Baby?
It'll be okay, all right?
Get off my man, bitch!
You wanna fight?
Take that, demon!
Elbow smash!
Ooh!
Harder!
Beast!
Take that, demon!
Fucking bitch, take that.
That demon can take a punch.
That's enough.
- Baby?
- Malcolm.
I think she's okay.
Maybe not!
I won't tell on you, you don't tell on me.
Understand me?
You weren't here,
I wasn't here.
I'll take the blame.
I'll take the blame.
Okay, good. Hey!
Man, put some clothes on!
Hey.
Hey.
You know what? This Angry
Birds is kind of fun.
I told you.
I like it.
Look at you looking all pretty.
Oh, this? It's just a little something I put on for my man.
Oh, lucky him.
Oh. Ow...
Malcolm.
What? What? What?
My ribs are still a little sore.
I'm sorry. We did beat the hell out of you, girl.
We was just trying to get the demon out.
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry for bringing that thing into your house.
Our house.
Mmm!
Malcolm? Is the camera on?
Mm-hmm?
Fine.
Good.
Come here.
Take like that, take it like that.
Oh, my God, I hit the bottom.
Oh, yeah, take that.
Who's your dirty daddy?
Oh, God.
I got a cramp.
Don't touch it.
Malcolm!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm coming.
Shit.
Malcolm!
I heard you the first time.
Damn.
She's gone.
Yeah, baby, I lived!
I lived.
In your face.
In your face!
You thought you'd move into my house and kill me?
What?
She's right behind me, isn't she?
Oh, yeah.
We gonna need a wide angle for some of these aerial tricks.
All right, I call this one "The Superman."
Pile driver! Take that.
Take that.
Oh! Oh!
Can I get you something to drink, Father?
Yeah, Hennessy, straight.
Oh, you got Hpnotiq?
I like to mix them.
Uh, I was talking about water.
Water? I don't drink that bullshit.
What the fuck?
Yeah, my show is gonna be huge.
I'm gonna get my house back.
I'm gonna get a girlfriend.
I'm gonna be successful.
Did you just hope and dream out loud?
All hopes and dreams are out loud.
That's the camera show.
Oh, this is called "68," and I owe you one.
You're crazy, girl.
Yeah, I'll fart in your face.
Take that.
Now we gonna make some love.
But I ain't gonna kiss you on your mouth
'cause I just farted in your face.
Here's the thing. A lot of people think penises are scary.
They're not, unless it has a gun.
Then that's horrifying.
90% of penises don't carry a gun.
Oh, my God. What?
That's a fact.
But I'm gonna tell you this, don't ever, ever let a man put his hands on you.
Unless he paying the bills. Aah!
Domestic violence is amazing.
Gonna burn me.
I'm sorry. Shh. Shh.
Take it.
Ooh.
Ooh!
This is one bad picture right here, nigger.
This a fine motherfucker right here, boy.
This is dope.
You know what I'd do with this?
Do you know what
I'd do with this?
All this area, all this carpet, this ottoman,
I'd be all over it.
What are these?
Those are my boxers.
Fascinating.
Oh, yes.
His methods are so unorthodox.
That's my girlfriend.
Ah...
Kisha.
That's a crazy bitch name all day.
You can google it.
Top five crazy bitch names.
Kisha, Alisha, Djuana.
You say that out loud, and you're already scared, right?
Are you done?
Let's go.
Let's go save the bitch.
BUG: Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
NEWSCASTER:
Before tonight's murder, there has been no clue as to who this killer might be.
But now the Riverton Ripper and the knife he uses have been caught by a high-definition security camera.
SARAH: Any day, now.
NEWSCASTER: Police say that the killer is a Caucasian male in his mid-to-late 30s.
It's too dark to see his face but the quality of the image has allowed forensic technicians to zoom in and enhance it enough to make out the word ''Vengeance'' etched on the blade of the Ripper's weapon.
No one was in the area at the time...
SARAH: That's beautiful, Abel.
And Leah's going to love that house.
Shameless distraction device.
Come to bed.
The news is too scary for me to watch alone.
Okay, Sarah,
I'll be up soon.
NEWSCASTER: We consulted local psychiatrist
Dr. William Blake.
Oh, shit!
NEWSCASTER:
Here's what he had to say.
DR. BLAKE:
The identity of a killer of this sort may well not even be known to himself.
He could be anywhere and anyone leading a normal life, so far as he knows, and never dream for an instant that, every so often, he turns into a monster.
ABEL: What is this?
NEWSCASTER:
Twenty-one-year-old
Penny Anderson, a graduate student at Boston University...
WOMAN: (SCREAMING)
Somebody!
NEWSCASTER:
...studying for a Ph.D. in psychology.
WOMAN: Help me!
No!
NEWSCASTER:
The victim's funeral will be held tomorrow at...
Dear God, tell me this is a dream.
ABEL (AS JAMES):
What's with the knife, Abel?
What's with the blood?
It's really crazy stuff.
It's not my knife, James!
I don't know what's with it.
I think someone has broken in.
No one has broken in.
Come on, Penny.
FEMALE VOICE: Please, Abel.
Blake said it could happen.
A one in a million chance, he said.
What if it did?
He said to call him, 24/7.
(AS BRAD) Abel, listen.
Call him now. You've got to call Dr. Blake.
Please put down the knife.
Call the doctor.
FEMALE VOICE:
God will help you.
Call Dr. Blake, and I kill your family.
Sorry, sorry,
I just need a hug.
That knife is so scary, you know?
What knife?
SARAH: The Ripper's.
They've got it on tape.
RIPPER:
Don't do something stupid, Abel.
Here's the deal.
Just look the other way when I kill and your family stays alive.
Turn me in, and you'll live alone in a house of blood.
Hello?
Abel, this is Dr. Blake. ls everything okay?
No, no, no.
Everything is not okay.
I found something.
What did you find?
A knife.
Under my bench.
And not just any knife.
The one on TV.
The Ripper's knife.
I swear before God,
Dr. Blake, I didn't know.
But the second that I went to call you there was somebody, and he said don't call you, or else...
DR. BLAKE: Or else?
What?
Or else he would kill Sarah. And Leah.
And the others, too.
Abel, I'll be there in 10 minutes.
I want you to tell Sarah to take Leah, and drive to her sister's.
I haven't told her about this part of my life.
But you swore to me you would.
That's part of the agreement.
Just get here before it's too late!
DR. BLAKE: Abel, have Sarah drive to May's house, with Leah.
May is working nights and Sarah is sound asleep.
I can't just wake her up.
DR. BLAKE: You have to!
Abel?
You there?
Abel?
ABEL: No! No!
DR. BLAKE: What the hell are you looking at?
Break the door down.
ABEL: I won't let you do this! I won't!
DR. BLAKE:
Open the door. Abel!
ABEL: I won't...
DR. BLAKE: Abel!
PATERSON: Police, open up!
BOBBY: Mr. Plenkov, open up.
DR. BLAKE: Abel, open the door!
BOBBY: Plenkov! Open up!
PATERSON: Kick it in, Bobby.
DR. BLAKE: Get up those stairs now!
PATERSON: Which room?
On the right?
Mr. Plenkov! Mr. Plenkov!
Freeze!
Shit!
Bobby, check him!
Check him!
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, sweetie, come here.
Come here.
What's your name?
BOBBY: No pulse, Frank.
What's your name, huh?
BOBBY: I'll check the woman.
No, no, no, no, look at me.
You're okay, all right?
You're okay.
Get away from me.
Bobby.
Yeah?
Get her downstairs.
BOBBY:
Hey, sweetheart, here we go.
I got you.
You're going to be fine.
PATERSON: Get in here.
Cover us.
PATERSON: He's dead.
So is Elvis.
You never know.
You have an epi?
We got it.
JEANNE:
The mother is dead, too.
Way dead.
You missed the kid, you fuck.
I'll get them all next time.
Son of a bitch!
GUS: Epinephrine kicks ass!
Hey! Hey!
JEANNE: Let's get the gurney, Gus.
Abel, I'll get you to a hospital. Abel?
You piece of shit.
He's not a monster.
What do you call him, then?
I call him mentally ill.
(AS ABEL) Thank you for stopping me.
Abel.
Forgive me.
He's talking to you.
Please!
Would it hurt you to be human?
Just once?
We'll let
God sort it out.
Thank you.
No, Abel!
Abel, talk to me.
Abel's not here.
This is for you, you cunt!
That's for shut the fuck up.
How's Mrs. King doing?
Baby is two months premature.
Dr. Carrie says he's blind, too.
Seven births in one hour, all premature.
What's going on here?
Anarchy!
MAY: What else you got?
We got a cop, Frank Paterson, who took two in the vest.
And?
And we got a perp.
Go on.
Mid-30s, white male, under constraint and critical.
Took multiple gunshots and stab wounds.
EEG flat.
Oh, and are you ready for this?
We think he's the Ripper.
What?
Family guy.
Killed the wife, tried to kill his kid.
You got a name?
Plenkov. Abel Plenkov.
GUS: May, you copy?
May?
He said he'd get them all next time.
What do you think he meant?
Maybe he was talking about his other personalities.
My family is from Haiti.
And down there they don't say that someone like him has multiple personalities.
What do they say he has?
Multiple souls.
What's the difference?
Personalities die when the patient dies.
Souls live on.
It's all just superstition,
I suppose.
Could you hand me my jacket, please?
It's cold as hell in here.
Thanks. ls this your evidence bag?
Get that fucker under control!
Shit!
Frank!
I can't believe you fucking guys!
You're supposed to be watching him!
You all right?
You good?
Fuck you!
You're all right.
GUS: Let me see.
Get out of my way.
Where the hell is Plenkov?
GUS: Let me see!
PATERSON: Shit. Fix that!
PATERSON: Call for backup!
I got Plenkov!
PATERSON: Fuck!
CROWD: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
BRANDON: The lights out!
BRANDON: Midnight!
All right! This is it!
Let the day begin!
As you all know,
Ripper Day marks two things.
One of them bad, one of them good.
The good part is, it's the birthday of seven of us here born 16 years ago tonight.
Jerome King.
Hey, Jerome.
Alex Dunkelman.
Jay Chan, with a new
Ripper puppet tonight.
Bug Hellerman...
Hellerman?
ALEX: It's about time!
BRANDON:
Better late than never,
I suppose.
Where you been?
Sleeping.
It's okay, Bug takes a little longer because he's a little slower, I guess.
Moving on to
Penelope Bryte over there, by the ambulance, who, incidentally, knows God.
They speak daily.
And to the beautiful and gorgeous
Brittany Cunningham.
And last, but, of course, not least...
ALL: Brandon O'Neil!
Yes, sir!
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Pleasure.
Now, it's time for the bad part, people.
We of the Riverton Seven have had to share our birthday with a monster, the serial killer
Abel Plenkov, who died at midnight the day we were born.
It's the Ripper.
CROWD: Ooh.
Legend has it that we, the Riverton Seven, are the mirrors of Abel Plenkov's personalities.
The ones that turned the Ripper in.
And that the Ripper still wants revenge.
So Abel Plenkov is dead, but his ghost isn't.
No, it lurks underneath the old railroad bridge.
You've seen it.
It sleeps in the river.
It roams the darkest corners of the woods just waiting for the next Ripper Day to come around.
Because, on that day, our birthday, tonight, the devil has told him that he can take his revenge.
But he can only come out of the river at this spot.
And every year, since we have been able, one of us Riverton Seven has volunteered to drive him back into the river where he belongs.
And tonight is no exception.
And I, personally, have chosen to volunteer...
GIRL 1 : Brandon?
GIRL 2: No!
...to volunteer
Bug Hellerman, that is.
BRANDON: It's your turn, Bug.
All the rest of us have done it.
We will now summon the Ripper from the river.
If he appears yet again, then Bug must slay him, or we'll all die.
Can you do it, Bug?
Save us!
Let's call him up!
If you can hear me, Ripper, make yourself known!
ALL: Make yourself known!
Make yourself known!
Make yourself known!
Make yourself known!
Make yourself known!
BRANDON: Fear ye, Ripper!
ALL: Fear ye the Ripper!
Shut up!
JEROME: What did I do?
ALEX: Bug is freaking out.
BRANDON: Fear ye the Ripper!
ALL: Fear ye the Ripper!
GIRL 1 :
Oh, my God.
What is that?
JEROME: It's coming from the woods.
BRANDON: Whoa! Nice, Jay.
JAY: Damn right.
Come on, Bug, it's just a puppet.
Knock it over.
ALL: Fear ye the Ripper!
JEROME: Come on, you can take him, Bug!
Get in there, you pussy!
Look at how scared he is!
ALEX: Push him over.
BRANDON: Down on your knees, Bug!
JEROME: Slay that beastie, Bug.
BRANDON: Damn, that is a big mother.
JEROME: Bug, come on!
BRANDON: Get him!
What are you doing?
I can't do this!
BRANDON:
But you must, or we'll die!
ALEX: Come on, Bug.
Just knock him down!
That's all you have to do.
This is the police.
Disperse immediately!
Cops!
POLICEMAN: You're in violation of the Riverton midnight curfew!
Return to your homes immediately or your parents will face prosecution.
Bug, run!
BRANDON: Police brutality!
POLICEMAN: You want brutality?
I'll show you brutality!
BRANDON: God damn it!
ALEX: Watch the tree, Jerome.
ALEX: Sorry, Bug, sorry.
You're good?
He's still alive. It's okay.
Grab my hand.
I'm blind, Bug.
Not you.
You good?
Who's this?
JEROME: It's not cool.
ALEX: Why the hell are there cops here?
JAY: Jerome, big log. Big log.
Get down.
What the fuck was that?
Why did they stop us?
POLICEMAN: Go home!
Ripper Day has been officially canceled.
JAY: Just better sit and wait.
Why so glum, chum?
I failed.
Because you couldn't kill him?
Now we're all going to die, and it's my fault.
No!
That's bullshit
Brandon made up.
If he was so worried about it, he should have killed it himself.
That puppet was scary.
Thanks.
And the coat was creepy.
You added some moss and grass and shit, right?
Yeah, man, he lived under the river for like 16 years.
He's primeval, baby!
If he rode in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, how did he get the coat and everything? ln my version, the day after Plenkov supposedly drowned his house was burglarized, right?
And he took the boots, the coat, his whole outfit.
Why would a burglar just take clothes?
A burglar wouldn't, Bug.
But Plenkov would, if he was still alive!
Exactly!
The Ripper's alive?
ALEX: Could be.
I thought you said he was just a ghost.
No, he's dead.
No. Not necessarily.
They never found his body.
And nobody really knew him or his wife very well.
They were new to Riverton.
Yeah.
And, Plenkov could look completely different after 16 years!
Like, cosmetic surgery, hair transplants,
Weight Watchers.
And he could have changed his name.
Snuck back into Riverton to get his revenge this year.
He could be
Principal Pratt!
Shut the fuck up!
I got to get home, guys.
Wait, are you guys set for tomorrow?
For what?
JAY: The buzzard thing or whatever.
Condor.
Yeah, we made a sock puppet.
A sock puppet?
You'll put your class to sleep!
A good show-and-tell needs shock-and-awe!
It's my fault.
I was too scared about tonight to think about it.
Listen, Bug.
I'm scared of the Ripper, too.
You are?
I got to cross that bridge twice a day.
I do what my grandma taught me.
Spit in the river, and he won't come after me.
That works?
Yeah, for 16 years.
See you, guys!
See you.
I got to go.
We should go, too.
Quint is going to kill me if he catches me out this late.
BOBBY: I don't know about this new curfew.
We should've let them kill him first.
PATERSON: Kill who?
Plenkov.
The Ripper.
Very creative.
That's why every kid in Riverton has Ripper nightmares and the adults have memorial services.
It's time to move on!
Leave the past behind.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
PATERSON: I'm glad they're getting rid of it.
Rid of what?
That damn ambulance.
Pratt, the new principal at the high school convinced the chamber of commerce it was bad for tourism.
What?
No, no, no! It's a memorial.
That's why it's still here.
Tourism, Bob.
Tourism is where everything is going.
''Let's go to Riverton, honey,
''where that crazy fucker killed seven people and his wife.''
Not.
JAY: What the hell?
Fear ye the Ripper!
I spit in the river!
I spit in the river!
Bug!
Alex!
No! Please, no!
What just happened?
QUlNT: You better be in bed.
I'll kick your punk ass if you ain't!
If you fuck with me, you'll be sorry!
Shithead!
Fear ye the Ripper.
DR. COOPER ON RADIO:
The California Condors are magnificent birds.
They can fly 15,000 feet high, cruise at 55 miles per hour and cover 150 miles in a single day.
And they're so big, they're often mistaken for small airplanes on radar.
I mean... I mean, they're huge.
FEMALE RADIO HOST:
That's amazing.
You're listening to The Birding Hour, and the guest tonight is Dr. Richard Cooper, national expert on the California Condor and author of the bestselling book,
Keeper of the Souls.
Please, Dr. Cooper, this is fascinating.
Tell us some more.
DR. COOPER:
They've been pulled back from the brink of extinction a bit.
They're hanging in there.
The California Condor has always captured the imagination.
A Native American medicine man once said,
''It's true that the condor literally eats death.
''But the great bird is not sickened by this.
''No, it has a secret.
''It keeps the souls of all the fallen creatures it consumes.
''And they are its treasure and its protection.
''And with each soul it takes in and shelters it grows larger and wiser.
''Too large and wise to ever succumb to death itself. ''
RADIO HOST: Well, we all know that the California Condor was near extinction.
It's so nice to hear that they have a fighting chance now.
DR. COOPER: Oh, they are surviving with the help of some terrific people.
And they have some very interesting ways of defending themselves, too.
RADIO HOST: Really?
Could you share some of those?
DR. COOPER: Not on the radio.
PENELOPE: And please watch over the missionaries, our soldiers in foreign lands, the President, Mom and Dad, and especially the seven of us, this day. ls this the year?
It feels like it.
I know you can't tell me, but please keep Bug safe. ln Jesus' name, amen.
PENELOPE'S MOM:
Penelope! It's getting late.
I'm coming!
It's getting late.
Thank you.
Message received.
Crows, 10.
Snot-nosed kids, zip.
Hey!
Ass-wipe!
Get your little butt to school before I put my boot up it!
Let's go! Now!
Can you step back a little bit, Quint?
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?
Of course I trust you.
Don't trust anyone, you dumb shit.
Thanks, Quint.
Felt good.
Anytime!
I know you want me,
Brittany.
Speaking.
I've got today's assignment, Brandon.
Got paper and pen?
Of course I do.
Bug Hellerman, three.
Bug?
Alex Dunkelman, eight.
I need it done this morning.
Alex gets an eight?
You have a problem with that?
No, it's just that it's pretty high on Fang's punitive scale.
Usually, giving an eight to the son of a felon comes with a bonus, is all.
Don't say something stupid, Brandon.
Nothing big.
A blowjob would do.
How about I have my dog bite it off and bury it in my backyard?
How big is your backyard?
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Good morning, Riverton.
It's hour 7 of Ripper Day 16.
And we're talking with Betty O'Neil, mother of Riverton star quarterback,
Brandon O'Neil and head of the group,
Citizens for a Saner Riverton.
Mrs. O'Neil, why ban Ripper Day?
It's just kids having fun, isn't it?
BETTY: No, it's not kids having fun.
It's kids having nightmares, seeing the Ripper everywhere. Kids...
Jumpy this morning, aren't we?
Where is the sock puppet?
Where did you come from?
Your window, where else?
WOMAN ON RADIO: ls Brandon damaged, do you think?
BETTY:
Of course Brandon isn't...
What the fuck is that?
Sock puppet.
On steroids?
Kind of.
Kind of?
Only you wear it this time.
What? Excuse me?
BUG: Like Jay said,
''Shock and awe.''
Thought Edgar was a home crow.
Raven.
He's a guard.
He watches over you, you know?
You're still spooked by last night, right?
We were all watching the river and he came from the woods.
That's scary.
Now, that's Jay's whole thing.
Never do what they expect.
And now we got Edgar up there to keep him away. So...
You can have him if you want, after tonight.
Edgar.
Seriously?
Yeah. It's your birthday.
Well, thanks.
I should get you a present.
How about a weekend in Las Vegas with
Brittany Cunningham?
Brittany doesn't know I'm alive.
She's gonna, after two days and two nights of star-studded shows and high-stakes gambling.
Oh, yeah.
Or I could just help you with that.
Yeah, that's just as good.
It's heavy.
It's all the fluids.
Fluids?
PENELOPE:
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me through all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Amen.
I know you're there, Lord.
And I know you're here.
BUG: Hello?
MAY: You like it?
Yeah, it's great.
Thanks, Mom.
I scotch-taped your number to it.
And mine, and 9-1-1.
Happy birthday, Bug.
I love you.
Love you, too.
How do...
Do I close it?
Hit the red button.
Boom, done.
Small!
That bad?
No, that's good.
CHANDELLE: Jerome.
Uh-oh.
Get, Dunkelman.
ALEX: Catch you later, Jerome.
What did I do now?
See you, Jerome.
It's what you're not going to do, which is hang out with them.
Why not?
It's bad luck, is ''why not.''
Especially on Ripper Day.
You should totally come some year, Fang.
It was wild!
Like, Brandon set Bug up to fight the monster, which was huge, by the way.
And Bug, he was so scared.
Brandon didn't set
Bug up. I did.
Do you know how to steam open an envelope so it doesn't show?
Put it in the freezer for an hour.
It opens itself and reseals perfectly.
This is to Bug.
Oh, really?
Here they come.
Hold up, boys.
What do you got there?
Happy birthday, insect.
Clueless as usual.
Go.
Mr. Kaiser, sixth period biology.
It'll be there.
Thanks, Jose.
So, you want to come over tonight?
We could burn the house down with my stepfather in it.
Ha, ha, ha!
He give you anything for your birthday?
Yeah, a hematoma.
Made it himself, too.
Oh!
Behold, Bug, what light in yonder window breaks.
She is so beautiful.
She's hot for you, too.
You should go over there and talk to her.
Excuse me,
Officer Ramirez.
Maria told me you know all about baseball.
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-oh.
RAMlREZ: What do you want to know?
Distraction maneuver.
Run!
Bug. This is a three.
Dunkelman, this is an eight.
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
Dunkelman, stay away from the Fang Zone.
And you, you stay away from him.
ALEX: Thanks, Brandon.
Felt good.
BRANDON: Ass-wipe.
Not as good as your mother felt last night, though.
Just bought yourself a 20.
Brandon O'Neil.
Do not bring the wrath of Jehovah down upon you.
Your sins are already a stench in the nostrils of an angry God.
Like knocking up
Melanie Pratt, who's only 15 and the principal's daughter.
What? Melanie's pregnant?
She's in my prayer group. Duh!
What men will do to you in prison is nothing compared to what demons will do to you in Hell.
On beds of fire.
Through all eternity.
I'm going to get you for this, Penelope.
If you do, God will get you, Brandon, and it won't be pretty.
When you least expect it, Dunkelman.
Hi, Bug!
Hi.
Happy birthday!
Thanks, Penelope.
Same to you.
Did you get my note?
Note?
I left it in your mailbox.
No.
It doesn't matter.
What?
Pray for our souls, Bug.
He's coming.
Jesus?
We should be so lucky.
Don't forget me.
Rise up and gird your loins, Alex.
The end is near.
Why is Penelope always saying weird stuff like that?
Parallel universe, baby.
I don't understand her, sometimes.
I mean, the way she said that.
Pray for our souls, Bug.
He's coming.
What if she meant the Ripper?
I'm scared.
We're 16, Bug.
Like it or not, we're men now.
I don't feel like a man.
No man does.
That's why you got to fake it.
Fake being a man to be a man?
That's the way it works.
So, you can't run.
You have to face your fear like a man.
Even though I'm not a man?
Because you're not a man.
Listen, the better you fake it, the better man you are.
Just fake it?
Well, fake it good.
Like, if you're scared, act like you don't give a shit.
Or if somebody hurts you, say, ''Thank you very much.
That felt wonderful.''
Thanks, Brandon.
I can't raise my arm.
Feels good.
Yeah, there you go.
That all you got, Brandon?
I mean, I feel downright cheated.
I'm amazed that you're getting this so quick.
It's tricky stuff.
I was faking that I did.
You were?
Completely.
Yeah, but you were faking it good.
I was?
Abso-fucking-lutely.
You now have permission to shave.
MR. KAISER:
As you know, class, we're nearing the end of our reports on living creatures.
Dogs, fish, honeybees.
We had an especially nice one from Brittany
Cunningham last session on the butterflies of our state.
Today's presentation will be by Adam Hellerman and Alex Dunkelman.
Are you boys ready?
Boys?
ALEX: Bug, come on.
MR. KAISER:
While we're young.
Get up!
I believe this is yours.
''Back from the Brink.''
By Adam Hellerman and Alex Dunkelman.
Dumbfuckelman.
Brandon.
Our subject today is about a bird.
You having another one of your migraines, Adam?
Shock and awe!
Adam!
Our subject today is the largest bird in North America.
Unchanged since the Pleistocene Epoch and only recently rescued from extinction.
I present to you
Gymnogyps californianus.
Anus.
MR. KAISER:
Brandon, second warning.
The California Condor.
Good Lord.
BUG: Are you ready?
Fly, now!
His wingspan is 10 feet wide.
His body, more than four feet high.
He can weigh as much as 350 parrots.
As for soaring, he can glide effortlessly for days until he finds his food, which is carrion.
A dead, stinking body crawling with maggots is ice-cream to him.
MR. KAISER: Bug.
Just showmanship, Mr. Kaiser.
The facts are correct.
A California Condor can consume the carcass of a cow in one day.
Bullshit.
BUG: And if anyone tries to harm it, if anyone even so much as touches one of its feathers, just one...
What are you going to do?
Going to bite me, asshole?
Uh-uh.
The bird will vomit copiously on its tormentor.
And if that doesn't work, the great bird has another defense, too.
Bottle two, Alex!
BRANDON:
What the hell is that?
And that is why no one should ever screw with the California Condor.
Thank you, Brandon.
That felt so good.
Alex and I would like to thank you all for your kind attention.
Hall pass. Go!
GIRL: That was so wrong!
Didn't mean to scare you.
You okay?
Yeah.
Bug, that was amazing.
Oh, my God, that suit was genius.
I felt like Mothra.
How'd you come up with that?
I don't know.
Have a good puke?
Couldn't.
Try the finger thing?
Nothing.
Bummer.
We should get out of here.
Brandon's really mad now, I guess.
You don't know the half of it.
Brandon is way past mad.
He's been humiliated twice in two hours in front of Brittany.
He's approaching nuclear.
But he's not the one we got to worry about.
He's not?
No, it's Fang.
Brandon only does what she tells him to do.
The fish stinks from the head.
Why would Fang want to hurt us?
You? I don't know.
Me, I got caught outside the girls' bathroom between 2:00 and 2:30.
That's when Fang and her crew talk business.
Anybody caught in the Fang Zone during that half hour is treated like a spy.
Just because you were out there doesn't mean you were spying.
I was spying.
There's a revolution going on here.
Fang must fall!
Fang, fall?
Like the mob.
We need to get something on her so incriminating that she has to leave us common folk alone.
If only we had some sort of listening device.
Hello?
Condor? Crow.
Fang and her crew arrive in the bathroom in three minutes.
Everyone else clears out five before.
That means we have a window of two minutes, starting now.
Window?
To get your phone in there. ln the girls' bathroom?
I'm sure Brittany is going to be there, as well, talking about you.
We could gather that kind of intelligence, also.
Talking about me?
Yeah, yeah.
You amazed her back there in biology, Bug.
She saw a new man standing there, fascinated, powerful, daring.
Get your phone in there.
You're going to hear it with your own ears.
But now, you only got a minute, 45.
What if there's somebody in there?
No, no.
I got that covered.
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.
Wrong bathroom, Jerome!
Yours is down the hall, around the corner.
Did I scare anyone else?
No one else is in there, but it's a Fang Zone in 30 seconds.
GIRL 1 : Let's go!
Come on, hurry up.
GIRL 2: I am!
Clear.
Can you hear me?
Ten seconds!
Go!
Come on, come on, come on.
Brittany, window,
Chandelle, door,
Maria, you've got five.
Go.
The sophomores have paid another year's protection for their bikes.
And the answers to next week's organic chemistry test are selling briskly.
Bottom line,
$2,000 in the bank.
We got her. (CHUCKLlNG)
Good numbers.
Speaking of numbers, apparently this morning there was a problem with Brandon giving the punitives?
A three and an eight,
I believe.
The numbers were administered properly and on schedule, however, before Brandon could leave the area,
Penelope Bryte came out of nowhere and told him he was going to hell.
Brandon would enjoy hell.
Kick some ass, take names.
There something you're not telling me?
Well,
Maria's dad was there.
I thought I told you to distract him with the baseball stuff.
I did, but Penelope's yelling got your father looking straight at us.
Maybe Penelope needs a 10.
A 10?
A 10?
What's her story, anyway?
She's obsessed with Bug.
Girls find him attractive.
Do you?
What?
Find Bug attractive.
No, of course not.
Sorry.
He's a lunatic, Brittany.
A brain-bomb waiting to go off.
His only real friend is Dunkelman, and Dunkelman just uses him as his monkey.
He's been in and out institutions half his life.
Bug has killed people.
Killed people?
Monkey?
Wake up and smell the Starbucks.
You're right.
He's pathetic.
Brandon's the one for you, Brit.
He's a diamond. ln the rough,
I'll admit but a diamond just the same.
By comparison,
Bug is a lump of coal.
Trust me on this.
Okay?
Okay, Fang.
Good girl.
Bug, don't run away.
Stop it.
Bug, say, ''Thanks, Fang, that felt great.''
I'd be lying.
That's the point.
Thanks, Fang.
That felt great.
That felt fucking great.
That's a bad word.
Be bad.
It makes things good.
Everything's backwards with you.
Just fake you're bad.
Thanks, Fang.
That felt fucking great.
That felt fucking great.
Good.
But you do have to do one more thing.
I can't handle another fucking thing, okay?
You've got to get your phone back.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm not fucking kidding you.
They're going to find it, they're going to trace it they're going to call your mom.
She's going to have to come in and get humiliated by Principal Pratt.
No fucking way!
Way. And enough with the ''fucks'' now.
You say ''fuck.''
You're not me, okay?
You're not me, okay?
Stop it.
Stop it.
Bug?
Bug?
Bug.
Bug.
BOTH: Boo!
Cut it out.
Cut it out.
Bug. Bug!
Bug. Bug!
Bug!
Bug!
What just happened?
Nothing.
Do you think
I'm a monkey, Alex?
Have you killed people, Bug?
Not that I can remember.
Well, I can't remember buying you bananas either.
I'll be right back.
ALEX: Keep it down in there.
Bug? Where are you?
What's taking you so long?
Bug?
Bug, someone's coming.
BRITTANY: Alex, what are you doing here?
ALEX: Hi, Brittany. Brittany, why are you going back into the bathroom?
BRITTANY: I forgot my purse.
None of your business.
ALEX: lncoming!
BRITTANY: Hello?
Please say this is a nightmare.
Please say this is a nightmare.
Anyone in there?
Hello? Who locked this?
He probably just fell in.
Accidents happen.
If Jeanne-Baptiste is down there, we're not talking accident.
I could fucking feel it coming.
Yeah.
You couldn't feel shit.
PATERSON: No, I could.
Give me a minute, all right?
JEANNE: Hey, Frank.
Hey.
He's been dead at least 1 2 hours.
What the hell hit him, Jeanne?
Two miles of this, for starters.
Any knife wounds?
Nothing obvious.
Could take an autopsy to know for sure.
Come on.
JEANNE: What? You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you?
PATERSON: What are you thinking?
Probably there was alcohol last night.
Might have gotten tipsy on his way home.
Kid's in my 1 2-step.
JEANNE: Sorry.
Well, we'll know quick enough.
The autopsy will tell us if there's any alcohol levels in the blood or any water in the lungs.
And I'll check for a knife wound. I will.
Sixteenth anniversary.
One and six is seven.
We didn't let them kill him last night, first time.
And it was Bug's turn.
It's kind of funny.
I get scientific in 16 years and you go voodoo on me.
What did your grandmother say?
What?
Did she tell you not to worry if somebody you thought was dead just might come back alive?
If he was evil enough?
Call me when you know something, yeah?
Okay.
Connecticut Condor?
Turkey Vulture.
You find Jay?
No, weird.
He always answers.
I saw him.
Where? ln the boys' bathroom mirror.
He was in the river, I think.
He tried to say something, but...
Bug, it's best not to think about your nightmares today.
It wasn't a nightmare.
Whatever it was.
Look, all seven of us are on edge today.
Seeing the Ripper in all sorts of weird places.
It's like Brandon said, the way the cookie crumbles.
For us.
Just for today.
You're a condor.
You eat death for breakfast, remember that.
Where you going?
Call me after Pratt.
Pervert.
I'm sorry I screamed.
I don't blame you.
You should get out more, Bug.
Shop. It's what I do when I'm scared.
You're scared?
Angry, is what
I meant to say.
GIRL 1 : Stay safe.
GIRL 2: Don't let the
Ripper get you.
Payback time!
Think twice, jockstrap!
You know what Fang would do if she knew you were moonlighting.
Yeah, well, nobody's looking.
But somebody's listening, Sasquatch.
Think about it.
I tell Chandelle, she tells Fang.
We all know how Fang doesn't like you off your little leash.
She'll mark you.
Put you in the river with concrete flippers.
That's actually just peachy, you know.
I'll let Ripper get you two.
You know, Bug, a lot of people have seen him already today.
It's not even dark.
Must be scary living in a house with no father to protect you.
You know, I bet if you look up ''rectum'' in the dictionary they would have a picture of Brandon there.
You don't know fear, Bug.
You puked on Brandon O'Neil.
You're a hero of the revolution.
Hey, Penelope.
Hey, Jerome.
What was it this time?
You're wearing those squeaky shoes again.
You can really hear that?
Got to go. See you.
See you.
Hey.
Hey.
So, I heard you're seeing Principal Pratt? ln 15 minutes.
They called my mom at work.
I'm doomed.
We're all doomed, Bug.
It's the human condition.
The next life's the thing to focus on.
It's Melanie Pratt.
She wants me to pray with her.
You want to come?
I'll be with Father Pratt.
Right. Well,
God hears you, wherever you are.
If things get too hot, just turn on the prayer-conditioning.
(AS ALEX) Bug, it's best not to think about your nightmares today.
(AS JAY) I've got to cross that bridge twice a day.
(AS BRITTANY) Shop. That's what I do when I'm scared.
(AS JEROME) You don't know what fear is, Bug.
You puked in
Brandon O'Neil's face.
I mean, you're a hero of the revolution.
Must be pretty scary sleeping in a house no father to protect you.
PENELOPE: Cops!
(AS PENELOPE) If things get too hot, just turn up the prayer-conditioning.
Fear ye the Ripper!
PENELOPE: Lord, this is a sin not of hate but of love.
So please remember, you put the apple and the happy little snake together in one small garden, so, you know things can happen now and then.
And just wrap your arms around Melanie and let her know that, no matter what, you're there for her and love her to pieces.
Amen.
Thanks, Penelope.
Now you.
I'm so ashamed.
Don't be.
It's a baby, not a bomb.
Lord, it might as well be a bomb.
I mean, I feel so guilty.
But you know how Brandon is.
''Please, please, pretty please.''
But I still should have said no.
He said it would make me feel special.
It hasn't.
It's made me feel fat and stupid.
My father will be the laughingstock.
My mother will probably die.
My little sister Amy, she'll join a cult or something.
Who is that?
Melanie!
Melanie, run!
Melanie?
RIPPER: Die now.
If I should die before I wake...
PRATT: Adam?
...I pray the Lord our souls to take.
Adam?
Adam, Principal Pratt asked you a question.
The end is near.
Did you know your daughter's pregnant?
What?
She's in my prayer group. Duh.
Bug!
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself, Mom.
Mr. Pratt, what was the question?
It's not important.
You can go now, Adam.
And take your creature with you.
Your mom and I are going to chat for a while.
We'll speak at home, Bug.
Straight home.
All right.
I'm so sorry.
I don't think he got much sleep last night.
Yes, Ripper Night.
It's an outrage that it's lasted this long.
And for a sensitive child like Adam, it can be especially dangerous.
I was checking Adam's file and it's remarkable, not so much for what's in it, but for what's not.
Pardon?
I've been a principal here for six months and I can find no medical files for him, except his vaccination records, of course, which are the one thing he absolutely must have in order to attend school here.
Bug has no medical issues, really.
If he did, we'd have no way of knowing, would we?
I'm his mother, I would.
Well, that's right.
You're a nurse at Riverton Community.
Head Nurse, OBlGYN.
Uh-huh.
Are Adam's records there?
Adam has never been hospitalized.
Has Adam ever been tested?
Neurologically, I mean.
Neurologically?
Why would he be?
Well, since I've been principal here, he's awakened twice in study hall screaming.
He's got chronic migraines.
He's claustrophobic.
Claustrophobic?
Last year,
I was told, a friend put him in an empty locker just for fun and he was so hysterical he had to be sent home.
Brandon O'Neil is no friend.
He's a bully who never gets more than slap on the wrist.
I'm talking about Adam here, Ms. Hellerman.
He has serious issues.
And today he terrorized a classroom with this monstrous bird that he built.
It vomited on them.
And worse, he's obsessed with this California buzzard.
Not a hummingbird, not a robin, not an American eagle, but a bird that eats dead things.
California Condor.
Whatever.
It eats dead things.
Native Americans considered it sacred.
It cleans the earth to make room for new life.
Maybe they understood something we don't.
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
Tomorrow,
I am sending Adam for psychological testing to a state facility in Boston.
You what?
For Adam's safety and the safety of the normal students in this school.
It is my responsibility, and it is my legal right to do so.
(AS FANG) Brandon's the one for you, Brit.
He's a diamond.
A diamond in the rough,
I admit, but a diamond just the same.
Compared to him,
Bug's a lump of coal.
BRITTANY: I know.
Church in two hours.
I'll be there.
I'll be home in two shakes. Bye.
Hey, Brittany!
Training for the marathon, Brandon?
Yeah. You know,
I got to keep in shape.
You're in great shape.
You got time for that oral?
You're like a crotch dog.
You know, the kind that stick their nose in your crotch when you're not looking?
It's like a handshake, really.
My father had a crotch dog.
Mom had it put out of its misery.
Misery is what
I'm talking about.
Come on, Brittany,
I went the extra mile for you today.
I could've gotten expelled for that eight.
Plus, I got shit on twice.
Once by a Jesus freak, once by a fucking buzzard.
Condor.
BRANDON: It's just got me tense.
BRITTANY: Start a hobby.
This is my hobby.
Besides, it's my birthday.
It's all of our birthdays.
I know, but I need it.
And I want it.
It should make you feel special.
Come on. Fang thinks we're a good match.
Fang doesn't run my private life.
Does she know that?
Because I could bring her up to speed.
You threatening me?
I'm begging you. ln the woods.
You hate the woods.
It's spring.
I'm feeling romantic.
Count to 60.
You tricking me?
I got a temper.
You're not the only one.
BRANDON: Sixty seconds.
Fifty.
Forty-two.
Thirty.
Fifteen.
Three.
Hey, Brittany!
Hey, you fucking bitch!
Hey!
Hey! Wait!
BRANDON: Hey, Brittany!
Where did you go?
Brittany!
Brittany!
Penelope?
Penelope.
Now you're going to get it.
Hello?
BRITTANY: Just because she embarrassed you in front of me, you killed her?
You are going to burn in hell.
What?
Better start running the other way, Brandon.
I've called the police.
What? No, no.
Brittany, Brittany.
Don't! Don't!
Brittany, Brittany, Brittany!
Please don't get me arrested, all right?
I knocked up
Principal Pratt's daughter.
He'll have me murdered in my cell.
Hey, do you understand what I'm saying?
Brittany, look,
I know you're there.
I can hear you walking. Just...
I understand that you don't want to talk.
I probably disgust you.
It's okay,
I disgust myself, sometimes.
I know I'm a pig.
I can't help it.
No! Pigs are nicer.
Actually, I'm just what you said.
I'm a fucking crotch dog.
I'm sorry.
RIPPER: It's too late to be sorry.
Who is this?
Someone from your past.
You wouldn't remember.
Put Brittany on, please.
She's not here.
Well, where is she?
Where you're going to go.
I'm going to go to the church.
No, you're not.
What do you mean,
''No, I'm not?''
Think hotter.
Miami?
RIPPER: Try hell!
Anybody you want to say goodbye to?
My unborn child.
Fuck your fucking unborn child.
Now, where did
I leave your bitch?
What?
Whose phone?
Oh, my God.
OPERATOR:
This is Riverton 9-1-1.
Please hold.
All our circuits are busy.
We will get to your call as soon as we can.
Be home, Bug Hellerman.
MAY: Okay, 10:00 a.m.,
Boston Psychiatric Clinic.
I got to go.
BUG: Oh.
Wow!
I'm sorry I'm so late.
You should be.
Have a seat.
You're too big to spank.
Okay.
Sweater.
Did you fall?
I was burying a friend.
My condor.
Brandon ruined it.
I gave it a decent burial.
You gave me a start.
Why, you think
I killed somebody?
No, of course not.
Make a wish.
Do you want to know what I wished for?
No.
I wished that
I could take back what I did today and make you proud of me instead.
I was trying to get my phone back, the one you gave me, and unfortunately,
I fell into the toilet.
My phone fell into Brittany
Cunningham's bag and I didn't have a chance to get it out.
What was your phone doing in the girls' bathroom in the first place?
We were trying to gather some information about something.
Don't tell me.
You and Alex?
I wanted to know what
Brittany thought of me.
Brittany Cunningham?
She's a little sophisticated for you, isn't she?
I like her.
So did you find out what she thinks of you?
She thinks he's a retard like everyone else.
Do not use that word in this house!
It's okay.
Just because Leah says mean things, doesn't make them so.
What if they are so?
What?
They are.
Watch your nuts, little squirrel.
Leah told Brittany that I had been in institutions.
That I had killed people.
Have I?
Leah will say anything.
You don't have the most supportive sister in the world.
Who are you calling?
Your phone.
Mom! Come on, Mom.
No, please.
Hey.
Hey.
Penelope Bryte.
Done with a knife, just like the others.
Oh, fuck.
Hey, Frank!
Keeps going to voicemail.
She's with Brandon.
How did you know that?
I just do.
Time for presents.
Well, this is a first.
I don't give gifts just to give them, May.
Gifts should mean something.
Happy sweet 16th.
What is it?
Open it.
I don't understand.
Bug!
Huh?
Go to your room, now!
What did I do?
Just go!
What?
No, leave that thing here.
Leah gave it to me, so I guess it's mine.
How could you?
Somebody's got to bust his cherry.
I'm sorry to hit you.
But you deserve it.
Your friends are calling, May.
They want you at the church so you can all lie to each other again.
You know?
How God works in mysterious ways and how everything works out for the good if you just keep repeating the lies.
Like, ''The Ripper's dead, he's not coming back.''
Would it kill you to look at things positively just once, Leah?
You're scared of being human.
You get your friends to do your dirty work.
You're still in high school at 19 because you're too chicken-shit to get on with your life.
You hide behind what should be dead and buried.
Like you hide behind me and Bug?
And my mother?
No, I did what I did to save Bug from what you've become.
And because my sister had more heart and courage on any given day than you have had in your whole miserable life!
Fuck you, May.
Hi.
Fuck you, too!
Leah.
Thanks, Leah.
That felt good.
Why do you hate me?
I've never done anything to you.
You've ruined my life!
That's what you've done, you little shit!
Why?
Why?
I will tell you why, maggot.
From the moment you were born everything went to shit for me!
You were the miracle baby, and I was the painful reminder!
You got to live in this dream and I got stuck in a fucking nightmare!
I am sick to death of your innocence!
It is an insult to me!
Why am I innocent?
You are so clueless, it is stunning!
Tell me.
Do you know who your father was?
May said that he loved us very much.
But who was he?
I don't know.
He died in a car crash.
On the way to the hospital to be with May when she was having you, right?
Yeah.
What a sad, yet beautiful story.
Have you ever asked yourself why May doesn't ever talk about him?
Or why there isn't a single fucking picture of him around the house?
Maybe it's too painful.
Do you know who
Abel Plenkov was?
The Riverton Ripper?
Besides that?
No.
Take a look in the mirror, Bug.
ABEL: Remember how much
I loved you, Leah.
(AS RIPPER) Leah, unlock the door for Daddy.
(AS ABEL) Leah, don't!
Don't listen to him!
Get out of my way!
Now you're going to get it!
Leah!
Leah.
PATERSON: Freeze!
ABEL: (AS RIPPER) Open the door, you little bitch!
GUS: Get over here.
We got a live fetus.
ABEL: (AS RIPPER) Open the door for Daddy!
You did good, Mama.
We'll take good care of your boy.
BUG: Leah?
Go away.
Open the door, Leah.
Do you want to die?
Get out of my room!
Fuck!
There.
We're even.
Where did you get that?
There's a revolution going on, Fang.
Hi.
Hi.
FANG: Hello? ls Leah okay?
Leah's fine.
Are you? You look...
I know you're not my mother.
Bug, I'm so sorry.
I never meant...
I hope you know something, too.
What?
That you are my mom.
That one you're stuck with, like it or not.
MARlA: Fang, you still there?
Are you still there?
Are you okay?
Maria just called.
They found Jay Chan in the river this morning.
No!
Penelope Bryte near the old ambulance.
Brandon and Brittany in the woods nearby.
I was a total shit to her today, and she's dead.
MAY: How can that be?
FANG: You know how that can be, May.
Our father is still alive.
MAY: Let's wait to see what really happened.
What's really happening, May, he's killing his way through the Riverton Seven.
He'll get Jerome, and Dunkelman, and then he'll come for us.
No.
We'll go to the church and be with the others.
I'll go to church with you, May.
But this is the last time.
And I'm sorry, but I had to tell him.
I'll get the car and be out front.
Get Bug, okay?
Bug.
Leah?
Ready?
Fuck.
I figured you'd come.
Really? Have you heard?
I've heard.
I've heard a lot.
Oh?
The Riverton Ripper,
Abel Plenkov?
Yeah?
He was my father.
That I know.
You do?
The parents of all the seven know.
I think I'm the only kid.
My mother told me the day she died.
Why didn't anyone tell me?
Sorry, we thought you were too...
I don't know. lnnocent?
I guess.
Well, I'm not anymore.
Yeah. I can see that.
Who beat you up?
Fang.
Figures.
Penelope sent me a letter.
A love letter?
No.
She wrote to warn me that he'd be coming back for us.
My father.
She had a source.
Oh, yeah.
She say anything else?
She said that there are two ways that he can come from.
One, if he survived 16 years ago, then he'll come back as Abel Plenkov.
Dad.
Option two?
Option two is he did die and his soul went into one of the seven kids who were born the night he died.
Hopped the nearest bus. ln this version, he's one of us killing all the rest.
Attack from the unexpected direction.
Yeah.
There's not many of us left to be unexpected, though.
You, me and Jerome.
Jerome's not a very good candidate.
Mmm-mmm.
So, you or me.
That's option two.
(EXHALlNG) Well,
I like option one better.
Makes more sense.
The Ripper who was stabbed and shot had a little fender-bender, ended up in the river, no biggie.
He patched himself up with stuff from the ambulance.
Survives on acorns and crawfish for 16 years.
So he just crawled out of the river in a rotting overcoat to take his revenge.
I'll just call the cops and tell them to keep an eye out for the Unabomber's evil twin.
Or not.
What's that?
The biggest knife
I could find in the kitchen.
Bug...
What would you say if I told you I was going to kill you, Alex?
I'd say you weren't.
Why not?
Because you're my best friend.
You're Bug.
Now you ask me.
You don't think
I could kill somebody?
No.
You'd be wrong, Bug.
Dead wrong.
You killed Penelope and Jay?
And the others?
Of course not.
I killed my stepfather.
You killed Quint?
He was drunk.
He hit me.
For the first time in my life,
I hit him back.
Fell down the steps and broke his stupid neck.
Alex, it's okay, okay?
No, it's not okay!
What I did...
It's not okay for everybody to be killing each other all the time!
You don't want something to drink?
You got rat poison?
No, we just ran out of rat poison.
I'm going to go get you water.
What is this?
Alex, I'll be right...
Ripper?
Son of a bitch!
Drop the knife, Bug.
Now.
Kick it over to me.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
Get your hands up.
Up.
Walk slow.
Why are you pointing that at me?
That is far enough.
Why?
Your phone was found next to Brittany
Cunningham's body.
It fell into her purse at school.
That was an accident.
You can ask my mom.
Your mom is why
I have to arrest you, Bug.
Mom!
Easy!
Stay there.
I was there when they cut you out of your mother, Bug.
You were the one thing that made the whole bloody mess bearable.
A fucking...
Miracle?
Yes!
Something bright in the dark.
And ever since, for all of us that were there, Bug, that's what you've been.
Fuck. How could you do this?
I didn't.
Hold out your hands, son.
Where's my sister?
Why don't you tell me?
RIPPER: It's time.
RIPPER: (SOFTLY) They never should've cut you out of your dead mother.
RIPPER: What happened to your wings, angel?
RIPPER: Fucking piece of shit!
Where is the knife?
Shut the fuck up.
Shut up.
RIPPER: Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Eww.
It's not as bad as it looks.
How did you get away?
I was already in the car.
I came inside just to see where May was, and I found her dead.
I knew that fucker would come for us.
Maybe he's gone.
No, no, no.
Let's go.
I think we should...
Die! Die! Die!
I saved you for last!
Fuck!
Leah, call the cops.
FANG: Son of a bitch!
Hey.
Leah, I need you to get the lights on.
Get out of the house, get to the neighbors and call the cops.
You think you can do that for me?
What are you going to do?
I'm going to give that fucker a 10.
Make it a 20.
BUG: Ripper?
Shit!
Jerome! Jerome, stop it! Jerome!
Hey, hey! Hey!
Hey.
Jerome.
Jerome.
The Ripper's up here, Bug.
Watch out.
It's okay, Jerome.
He's gone, all right?
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at the church.
Alex called me.
He said all three of us should be together.
Watch each other's backs.
I was halfway through the window when the Ripper stabbed me.
How did he get up here?
He must have come up the rope like I did.
I passed out on the roof, and then I came to and I heard fighting.
Was that you?
Him and me. Yeah, it was.
He was kicking my ass, too.
I tried calling the cops but I knocked over something, and then I heard him coming for me, so I ducked for the closet.
You saved my life, Jerome.
I did?
Yeah, he was going to kill me, and then you distracted him.
Good.
Dude, it's going to be okay.
Help is coming, all right?
You fought the Ripper, Bug.
You're a hero, like I told you.
I'm not a hero,
Jerome. I'm just...
Jerome?
Jerome?
What the fuck happened to you?
What happened to Jerome?
He's dead.
The Ripper got him.
A lot's happened since you've been gone, Alex.
Where did you disappear to?
I saw Paterson pulling up outside.
I ran. I hid in the woods.
Then I heard gunshots, so I came back.
I was afraid he shot you or something.
Where is he, anyway?
Downstairs. He's dead.
What?
What happened?
The Ripper happened.
He killed Mom, too.
May?
I can't believe this.
You went to get me a glass of water and now your mom, Paterson, and Jerome are dead?
Where were you?
I ran into Penelope.
Penelope is dead, Bug.
I saw her in the bathroom mirror.
She brought me Ripper's knife, and she made me take it.
Then I heard something downstairs and I went to come check on you, and you were gone.
Paterson wasn't after you.
He was after me.
He thought that I killed Brittany and my Mom.
It was the Ripper.
And where is the Ripper now?
I guess he got away out my window.
Or went out Leah's.
Hers is open, too.
And he tried to stab me to death with his...
Stab you with what?
With his knife.
I thought you had his knife.
I did, but...
Did you kill them, Bug?
What?
No, I...
I didn't kill anybody.
Not that you remember.
Bug, I got to tell you something.
And don't get upset.
What?
My mom told me this.
Your father was first diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 16.
Just like you are now.
What are you saying?
It's hereditary.
Plus, you were in your dead Mom forever.
Oxygen deprivation.
It can make you crazy, too.
Maybe all this stuff you've been describing didn't happen exactly the way you're saying it did.
You think I'm crazy?
No, I don't know what I think.
But I'm not walking away.
I've stuck by you through everything.
Through nightmares and migraines, hell, puking vultures when everybody else was calling you a ticking time bomb.
So, if you're not innocent anymore, that's okay.
I mean, I killed my stepfather tonight.
I'm no angel, either.
I'm not innocent anymore, Alex.
Not with all of them inside me now.
What?
With who inside you?
The rest of the
Riverton Seven.
Even Jerome.
All their souls are with me now.
Bug, maybe you should sit down and take a few deep breaths.
You think I'm crazy?
I'm actually a lot smarter than I was yesterday.
Let me ask you a question.
Why is there blood on your left ear?
What?
The top.
Hey!
Almost like you were hit with a vase or something.
Brandon told me to look for that.
Bug, you are officially bat-shit nuts.
I scraped it climbing up the roof.
Come on, let's get real, here.
BUG: Jay says that Ripper's getup was a costume for sure.
Oh, and Brittany has run a timeline.
You would've had enough time to kill Mom and put the knife in the bathroom sink while I was hiding under the bed and Leah was outside in the car.
And if Jerome came through the window when I was in the bathroom getting you water, you would've had time to stab him, and go downstairs and kill Paterson.
You might have tried to kill me, too.
Fuck.
BUG: But if you'd heard
Jerome upstairs, you would've had to get up there before he called the cops.
I could've killed you off earlier, remember?
Bug, you've watched one too many
Law and Order reruns.
Besides,
I'm a little guy.
You could beat me up in, like, 10 seconds.
Unless you had the bad soul in you.
And then you would fight like you were possessed.
Can't fucking believe you.
You're Adam Plenkov!
The son of a mass murderer!
Everybody in your house, and all your friends, except me, have been murdered.
If there's a bad soul here, you have it.
And you got it from your father.
Maybe you have been in institutions.
Maybe you have killed people, just in your last life.
But you're too stupid and blind to see that.
Maybe they'll find your Ripper costume buried along with your stupid condor outfit.
And they will come for you with torches.
What?
I didn't bury any Ripper costume with my condor.
Somebody did.
You son of a...
Evil doesn't forget betrayal, Plenkov.
You and the other sick Dr. Blake got me and then ran away like cowards.
Jumped into the first babies you could hide in.
So I saved you for last.
And I'll kill you now, or you can say yes to a deal.
What deal?
Same one
I offered your father,
16 years ago today.
Say yes, and you live.
Say no, and
I'll cut your throat.
Say yes to what?
To my happy ending of Riverton's fairytale.
There was no Ripper.
Just one of the
Riverton Seven that was a little crazy, dressed up like the Ripper, killed your mom, and Paterson, and four of his birth-mates before we finally stopped him.
One of the Riverton Seven?
The one of the seven with the bad soul.
The Ripper's soul.
BUG: Jerome?
Great twist, huh?
Everybody will think you were the killer but it turns out the attack came from a totally unexpected direction.
You'd lay all this on Jerome?
He won't mind.
He's dead.
You and me will be
Main-Street heroes helping each other forge a new beginning.
Recovering from our tragic losses.
Friends to the end.
What do you say?
Deal?
You're pathetic.
I don't even think you're Alex.
I don't know who you are.
I'm the one that's going to kill you if you don't say yes.
And then I'll say you did it.
And I'll be the hero all by myself.
Leah saw the whole fight.
She'll vouch for me.
Leah doesn't live through the night.
That's part of the deal, too.
Whoever or whatever you are, get out of Alex.
And go back to hell, where you came from.
I mean it.
Okay.
But I'll take you with me.
I thought that guy would never leave.
Alex.
Where is the biggest knife in the kitchen?
Where it needs to be.
Condor?
Crow.
It's all right, Bug.
Feels great.
Feels fucking great.
Fucking great.
Fly now.
I know you're up there.
And I know we're down here.
COP 1 : Police!
COP 2: Police!
Open the door!
Open up!
Open the door!
Open the door now!
BUG: I am the condor.
The Keeper of the Souls.
I eat death for breakfast.
I live in a house of blood and I accept that.
COP 3: Break it down!
BUG: That's all a man can do.
I was ready to be arrested that night.
I wasn't ready for what happened instead.
Leah had told them everything, and I was celebrated as a hero.
Don't worry about it, man.
They're on your side.
BUG: Alex Dunkelman killed his stepfather, a cop, a mother and five of the
Riverton Seven.
Your sister's right over there.
BUG: And I alone had stopped him from killing more.
I didn't feel like a hero at all.
But if it makes Riverton feel safe at night,
I'll fake that I'm their hero.
And I'll fake it good.
Alex wouldn't have it any other way.

Hello, Elena.
How are you today, hmm?
How are you feeling?
Have you had... any headaches?
You can tell me.
Your readings are relatively stable.
Very good.
That's very, very good.
You know, this is always the highlight of my day.
Rosemary.
Rosemary.
Oh.
Barry.
I didn't hear you come in.
Been sleeping long?
No...
Um...
- I wasn't sleeping.
- Hmm.
I was... meditating.
Oh, you were meditating, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Is everything okay?
Everything's fine.
If you're hungry, there's some brown rice and steamed asparagus in the refrigerator.
Wow, that sounds really good.
No, I'm not hungry... thank you.
Okay.
It's been a long day.
So, um,
I'm just going to hit the hay early.
Okay.
Good night, Barry.
Good night, Rosemary.
Night Mode.
Rest peacefully and reflect.
Aah-ah-ah!
I am so sorry that you were never able to meet your mother.
She was a very beautiful woman.
She was a very desirable woman.
Oh...
Hey, would you, uh... would you like to have a photo of her?
Would you like that?
Because you may just find one in your room, hmm.
You know, you are looking more and more like your mother every day.
You look tired today.
It's easy to become disillusioned when you don't know who you are... or what you are.
I know who I am.
That's what gives me my confidence... and my power.
And I know who you are, too, Elena.
I can guide you towards that achievement... to find your inner strength and your inner power.
We all have other forms... and your inner self... needs another to complete it.
I... can help you do that.
Oh...
You just... have to let me...
I... want... to see... my... father.
Oh.
Please.
Oh, Elena. Elena, Elena, Elena.
Elena, you know you can't.
You're a very sick girl, Elena.
You're not well.
This... world... is in chaos, Elena.
These are... times of, uh, great uncertainty and terrible danger.
And you are not ready.
You're just not well.
Don't worry, Elena, you'll see him again one day.
I promise.
Piece of shit.
What?
Rosemary.
Yeah.
We do have a system in place.
Yes, a comprehensive list has been compiled.
Mm-hmm. I see.
That's fine.
Rosemary, why don't you answer the fucking phone?
Margo.
Yes, Dr. Nyle?
It's come to my... attention, Margo...
Yes, Dr. Nyle?
It's come to my attention that...
Elena may be hiding an illicit object from us.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
So...
Keep your eyes peeled.
Yes, Dr. Nyle, I certainly will.
Good.
Very good.
Oh, Dr. Nyle?
Yeah.
Uh, how do you think she would have come into possession of the object?
I don't know, Margo.
I don't know.
But I'm looking into it.
Day Mode.
Every sunrise brings a new tomorrow.
Good morning.
Hope you're hungry.
Looks better than usual today.
What have you got there, a special picture?
Let me see.
Oh, come on, I'm just curious.
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?
Who is this?
Is it your mother?
Where is she?
Did she die?
Good.
Enjoy your dinner.
Stop.
Please stop.
Mercurio.
Are you awake?
Dr. Arboria.
Barry?
B-Barry, is that you, my friend?
Yes, Dr. Arboria, it's me.
Ah, oh...
Wonderful.
Come closer so I can see you.
It's wonderful to see you again.
You're looking well, my friend.
Thank you, Dr. Arboria.
So are you.
Oh, Barry, there's... no need to flatter an old man.
I know I-I've... seen better days.
Besides... the trappings of the mortal world are... but a distraction, wouldn't you say?
Of course, Dr. Arboria.
Yes.
What really matters... the part of ourselves we must nurture the most... is here.
I couldn't agree more.
Would you mind... assisting me?
Of course, Dr. Arboria.
Aren't these videos of the nature, ha, beautiful, Barry?
They make me remember a simpler time.
Yes, Dr. Arboria.
Me too.
You are about to embark on a great journey.
Are you ready, my friend?
I am ready.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Bring home the mother lode, Barry,
Barry, Barry, Barry.
Your mother's reabsorption into the cycle of life won't be for nothing, my darling Elena.
You will be the dawning of a new era for the human race and the human soul.
Let the new age of enlightenment begin.
No, Barry,
I don't like to see the... on my arm.
Of course.
How is my darling Elena?
Well, Dr. Arboria.
She's very well.
That's wonderful.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Yes, yes.
Oh, that's wonderful, Barry.
Yes.
That's so... wonderful.
Isn't it... beautiful?
Yes.
It is.
The dormant volcano,
Haleakala Crater.
Mark Tain described sunrise here as "the sublimest spectacle
I have ever witnessed."
To the west of Maui lies Molokai.
Except for a few beautiful resort hotels, the modern world has touched Molokai less than any of the other vacation islands.
Aloha means welcome.
It also means love... and all too soon... farewell.
Rocket launchers, while the Soviets have produced more than 13,000, a staggering 14-to-1 ratio.
They didn't stop when their forces exceeded all requirements of a legitimate defensive capability, and they haven't stopped now.
But today they're building weapons as sophisticated and modern as our own.
As the Soviets have increased their military power, they've been emboldened to extend that power.
They're spreading their military influence in ways that can directly challenge our vital interests and those of our allies.
The following aerial photographs, most of them secret until now, illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home...

Barry?
Barry!
Oh.
Barry, you startled me.
I thought you were an intruder.
What are you doing?
Barry, you're not wearing your appliances.
I don't want to wear them any more.
But...
It's just you haven't let me see you... without them in a long time.
Where did you get that outfit?
Has something happened?
Sometimes...

I went to another world, Rosemary.
I see what others cannot see.
Please.
I looked into the eye of the god.
It looked right back through me.
It looked through everything.
Rosemary, it was so, so, so beautiful.
Like a black rainbow... and it chose me.
It chose to reveal itself to me.
You're nothing.
You're less than nothing.
Just... spit in the wind.
Let go of me.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm going to set you free.

OK
My mom
You just know you are trying to protect me
Thanks!
I'm happy you are safe now and for the
Eva, we've got to go now!
Now, now!
- Come on, Eva!
Come on, hurry!
Come on, run!
Eva, come on!
Come on, Eva.
We don't have time.
We don't have time.
- Come on, Eva!
- Get out the door!
- Run!
- Eva!
- Go, go, go, go!
Mommy!
Get back!
Go on, go!
Hold on to me.
Let there be light.
Yeah.
Not exactly the Garden of Eden.
After a blast, everything gets vaporized and sucked up into the atmosphere.
And it rains back down to earth... as radioactive dust.
Number one rule:
No one opens that door till the radiation clears.
You understand me?
You want to survive, you listen to me.
Jesus!
Someone get the lights!
- You okay? You okay?
- Someone get the lights!
- Calm down. Calm down.
Don't touch that.
Holy shit, it's the dust!
It's the dust!
That dust is from the inside.
The bitch is sealed tight.
What was that?
Another bomb?
That was our building coming down.
How the fuck do you know that?
I don't want to be down here.
I want to go now.
I know, sweetie.
But Uncle Mickey says we have to stay.
- Why?
- Because your face will melt off and your hair will fall out.
She's a little girl.
I was just fucking around.
- So that was a nuke?
- Definitely.
Fucking rag-heads.
- We got to stay down here?
- Bet your ass we do.
That door stays sealed until the radiation clears.
And how long's that gonna take?
When I say.
What's the plan, Mickey?
Well, my plan was to build a fallout shelter and take it easy while my pain-in-the-ass tenants barbecued above me.
Does anybody's cell phones work?
No, there's no signal.
- I fucking lost mine.
- You lost it?
Is that a radio?
Give it a try.
Cocksucking jack-off.
- Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello, do you copy?
What's down here?
As you see, just a bunch of storage cells full of junk.
Hey, uh... uh, it's Mickey, right?
Yeah.
Why do you have so many mattresses?
Because I'm the super of a goddamn apartment building.
So why do you have so many mattresses?
What the fuck do you care?
I sell them on the Internet.
Turkish bath in here.
Sorry, ladies, no running water to wash your panties.
Toilet's on the left.
It's septic, so after you finish, throw some lime on top of it.
That's fucking disgusting.
It's called saving water.
Sure, whatever.
I've got to take a dump.
What's in here?
That's my room.
Nobody goes in there but me.
Mama, I'm hungry.
Uh, Mickey... do you have anything to eat?
The food is adequate, I hope.
Don't thank me all at once.
No, the food's good.
Thanks, Mickey.
- Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Anybody there?
Hello?
- Shut up back there.
Hello?
We have survivors in a building on the northwest corner of 29th and 5th.
I repeat, the northwest corner of 29th and 5th.
Do you copy?
Do you really have to smoke that thing?
I mean, there's already so much dust in here.
So when can we go up?
When I say so.
Fuck it.
Ade, come on, let's go.
Adrien, come on.
Bobby, let's go. We're out of here.
Let's go. Fuck it.
What do you think you're doing?
Get away from the door.
I won't tell you again.
- I told you!
- Josh!
- Look out!
- Get away from the fucking door!
- Get away from the goddamn door!
- Come on!
Go ahead.
Shit!
What the fuck, Mickey?
God damn it.
- Fucking...
Fucking big man with that ax, huh?
Keep pushing me, Mickey.
Keep fucking pushing me, you're gonna see what happens.
Ever see what happened to those poor Japanese bastards... after we dropped
Little Boy on Nagasaki?
The skin melting off their bones.
Faces like roadkill.
Lucky ones died in the blast.
And those kids in Chernobyl... eyes and... ears.
Shit growing all over 'em.
Tumors the size of grapefruits popping out of their necks.
Enough, Mickey.
We get it.
What you need to get is if that dust gets in here, we're all fucked.
Hope not.
Come here, honey.
Let me braid your hair.
Can I borrow that, please?
Of course.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
You kept it.
Of course I did.
Eva,
I'm sorry if I've been acting a little bit nuts.
I'm just trying, you know, to keep it together.
I guess that's what survival is, just trying to keep it together.
But I love you.
And you love me.
And that's what's going to pull us through this nightmare.
It'll make us better parents.
Eva.
- Eva.
- What?
Come on, honey.
Just one more bite.
I want to go home.
Do you want me to try and warm them up for you?
We are going to die, aren't we?
No, honey, we're not going to die.
We're going to live.
Let's just do our meditation, okay?
Shut your eyes.
Really picture the beautiful light and how good it makes us feel.
Let's do that right now, okay?
Come on.
- Shut your eyes.
- It doesn't work.
- It does work.
- I want to go home.
Wendy, you just have to be patient, okay?
And then it'll get better outside.
And then somebody'll come down and they'll help us.
- Promise?
- Promise.
Thank you.
Gonna have to eat this shit every day?
What'd you say?
What?
I give you food, shelter, and that's what you say?
Fuckers come down here, expect me to take care of you.
What do you contribute?
What'd you bring to the fucking party?
Take it easy, Mickey.
All my family and friends are probably dead, and all you can talk about are fucking beans?
Come on, Mick!
Are we really supposed to rely on this guy?
- Sam.
- No, no, no, no, really, really.
How long can you keep us alive in this... in this...
- Shit hole.
- Yes, exactly.
You know what?
This is a fucking shit hole, man.
Calm down. Sam...
No. No, I'm sorry.
I won't stop.
- Stop.
- I won't stop because I want someone to do something, that's all.
- I need someone to do something.
- Sam, calm down.
- No, I won't calm down because I...
- Sam.
Sam, please stop.
Stop!
- Do something, man. Come on!
- Sam, please stop.
Instead of just sitting around waiting to fucking die.
Don't be scared, Wendy.
Uncle Mickey only slaps little girls.
And you're a big girl, aren't you?
Want to see a magic trick?
I'm gonna take my thumb off for you, all right?
Yeeow!
God, that hurts.
Seen that one before?
Okay, let me think of another one.
Making your cigar disappear?
Oh, shit.
Shit.
It's a rescue.
Down here!
Down here!
- Cut the lights.
- What the hell for?
Just do it.
You guys, what's going on up there?
Hey, okay, we're civilians, all right?
Okay, we're all on the same side, right?
- Whoa, what are you doing?
Didn't you hear him?
Mommy!
Help me!
No!
- No!
- Help me!
Wendy!
No, no!
No! No!
- No!
- Get back.
Go, go, go! Run!
God!
We've got another
2-8-Baker.
Give me the lock!
Give me the lock!
- What lock?
- Get me the chain!
- I don't need your help.
- Get out of the way.
Come on, come on.
Put the chain on there.
- Mickey!
- Hey, Mickey!
I need some help.
Adrien got shot.
- Put him down over here.
- What? Okay.
- Whoa, whoa.
Hey, somebody fucking get something. He got shot!
- Oh, shit.
- I got to look.
Oh, shit, Bobby.
- What the fuck?
- Somebody get a medical kit.
Thank you.
- I got it. I got it.
- I don't know what to do.
- I got it. I got it.
- There's nothing here that's usable.
It's all from, like,
1984 or something.
- You gotta take the bullet out, right?
- It's gonna sting, okay?
All right.
Oh, fuck!
- Sorry.
- You're gonna be okay, man.
- He's gonna die.
- He's fine.
- He's gonna fucking die.
Shut up!
He's not gonna fucking die.
What do you want me to do?
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right, all right?
- Arch your back. Just lean a bit.
- Come on.
- Almost got it.
- Almost? He's gonna be all right?
- So he's gonna be okay?
- He's gonna be okay.
You're lucky it didn't hit the artery.
- He's gonna be okay.
- Okay, you got to clean that out.
I got it. Thank you.
Come over here.
Come over here.
Okay?
Put your hand on the back there.
Press hard on the front, keep your hands on the back.
- That's fine. That's good.
- Yeah.
Just like that.
He'll be all right.
Where's Sam?
- Hold this.
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Hold this as hard as you can.
- I'm here. I'm here. I got it.
Sam. Sam.
You okay?
You hurt?
You're alive.
- You're alive.
- Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Looks like some sort of biohazard suit.
It's a radiation suit.
Bet we got hit by one of those loose nukes I've been reading about.
It's just a matter of time before one of them hajis got their hands on one of them.
So you're saying it's the Arabs?
Of course they're Arabs.
They've been at war with us for 20 years.
It's just that we've been too busy stuffing ourselves at the trough to notice.
We should have wiped them off the map when we had the chance.
Now it's probably too fucking late.
Oh, shit.
Okay, that's disgusting.
Let me guess, North Koreans.
- You're a fucking idiot.
- Get out of here.
Oh, fuck!
Holy shit.
Grab the tape.
I got her.
All right. Okay.
I got her. Ow!
All right, all right.
Take it easy.
Grab her arms.
Put her in the storage room.
Come on.
Get the door.
Get the door.
No!
Top rations.
Mickey's orders.
I'm fine. You take it.
You take it.
Can you make anything out?
Only thing I caught was something about finishing up the sweep.
And they're American accents.
Turn off the fucking radio, man.
That's what got us in trouble in the first place.
Hey, Mickey, what is that in your pocket?
Whether it's making a damn fine sausage or exterminating an entire race of people, those Germans don't fuck around.
You're holding out food on us now?
I got a couple of bits and pieces in my room.
It's my place.
It's my right.
- Just go back to your room.
- Damn it!
Has anyone fed Marilyn?
What the fuck is your problem, man?
Don't waste that.
What's so funny?
What?
What's so funny?
Oh, nothing.
Just what you said and how you said it.
"Has anyone fed Marilyn yet?"
Like she's your fucking dog.
He gets it.
Show some respect.
She just lost her kid.
Go back to sleep, Adrien.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
She's pissed.
You've got something on your face.
Other side.
That's it.
She's all that's good in me.
I'm sorry.
- Too risky.
- What do you mean it's too risky?
Whatever's in the air outside, it's in here.
Your goddamn duct tape won't make any difference.
At least we can find out what's going on out there even if we don't find her kid.
- You're volunteering?
- I'm volunteering.
He's volunteering.
I say if he wants to go, let him go.
- Let me go. Come on.
- I don't trust you coming back.
What is your problem with me?
- He's got a problem with everybody.
- What about Josh?
- No. Fuck, no.
- Me?
- What about Josh?
- You want me to go?
He ain't got the brains and that faggot ain't got the balls.
- He'll come back for his brother.
- Thanks, Mickey.
I'll go.
No, no, no, Eva.
Eva, you can't be serious.
- I'll go.
- Don't be stupid.
- I'll go.
- You happy, Mick?
You a punk. You know that?
You a punk.
When you ain't got no ax in your hand, then you got something to say.
I don't think he's gonna like what he finds out there.
At least we have to try.
Glove.
- How's your tube?
- Tube is good.
Excuse me.
Do you have air?
Is it working?
- You got one more to go.
- Is the compressor gonna work?
- Yeah, it's fine.
- There it is.
- Good to go?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
Promise me you'll bring her back.
I'll do my best.
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's do it. Let's go.
Let's do it.
What the hell is that?
Hey, Josh.
Don't worry, man.
I... I got this.
Wendy.
Hold it.
Go.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What did you see?
- You're okay.
- I think I got two of 'em.
- What did you see?
- Where's your gun?
They got this... this lab set up there.
It's like... it's like...
- Josh, what else?
- Like what?
- What else?
- What do you mean what else?
That's it.
There's no survivors.
There's no other civilians.
There's no fucking Red Cross.
I don't know if they're army.
I don't even know if they're American.
I'm sorry.
They're coming back.
No.
They're welding us in.
- How are you holding up?
- Uh, I'll live.
Delvin gave me his pain meds.
Mind if I take a look?
I just want to clean it.
You know it's gonna sting a little.
- Sorry.
You a nurse or something?
No.
You're just gonna have a nasty scar.
Yeah, well, chicks dig scars, right?
You lived below us, right?
Yep.
Was that you who played guitar?
Yeah. Did that annoy you?
No.
No, I actually really liked it.
Helped me sleep sometimes.
It keeps most people awake.
Not me.
Is everything all right?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Ugh, how can you eat with that smell?
We've got to get rid of those bodies.
How, exactly?
Chop 'em up, toss 'em down the septic.
Should have tried harder to get that door open.
That door is welded shut.
We should have put the bodies out when Josh went out.
Shame we let those bodies go rotten.
What do you mean?
You ever heard about that rugby team that survived the Andes?
Their plane crashed.
They were forced to eat their friends and family.
They survived up there for months.
They ate everything... ears, toes, assholes.
Uh-huh, arms, legs, brains, the spleen.
The only thing they didn't eat was the penis.
If worse comes to worst, you all have full permission to eat my body.
Yeah, you do.
But not my penis.
Nobody... nobody but nobody
- eats Bobby's penis.
What's that for, Mickey?
Uh-uh.
Delvin?
Well, yeah.
Fuck, yeah.
Yeah, I'll do it.
Come on.
I can do this, man.
I got this.
But can he live with it?
- Hey, Bobby?
- I got this, man.
Yeah, I'll be... fine.
It's just like cutting lumber.
I'll start with the arms.
I'll just get my swing down.
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.
Chop a body from head to toe.
It's blunt.
Man, what you doing in here?
What?
How did you get in here, man?
I heard you.
- When did you come in here?
- Fuck off.
How did you get in here?
What you got in your pocket?
Punk.
I was dreaming about Mom.
You think she's okay?
I don't care.
She's your mom.
She's not mine.
Just 'cause she cut my sandwiches...
- Hey, Adrien.
- Yeah?
I only went out there to see if there's a way out for us.
Hey, was Mickey an aviator or something?
Look at these.
What the hell's going on in here?
Come on, Mickey, we're just looking for some escapism, all right?
I told you from day one that this was my room and you were to stay out.
Your casa is our casa now.
I don't know what you're talking about, but you're gonna regret this.
This is my ball.
You got it out of my apartment?
- I got it out of your ass.
- You got it out of my apartment.
Hey, he's got forks.
- Adrien.
- I've been looking for this ball.
Don't need to use your dirty fingers any... hey!
- This is a very valuable ball.
- You got it fixed.
Hit down here, come this way, and jab real hard and start firing like this.
Now if they're behind you and they have a gun behind you...
- This is amazing.
- ...what you want to do is feel that tip.
Once you feel it, come to the outside.
The gun will discharge this way.
Take your arm, take both their hands, pull with this hand, and go forward and you'll take the gun away.
All right, soldier, fight safe and come back to the United States.
- Oh, another one?
- Mm-hmm.
- Where the hell did you get that one?
- It's the last one.
Come in.
Hi.
Here's the makeup.
Thanks.
Makeup.
Hey, listen, Marilyn.
You know, if you need to talk about anything, anything like that, I'm here.
You know?
'Cause...
I'm sure she's better off than we are right now.
- What are you talking about?
Wendy.
Eva.
You are a very beautiful girl.
And I know you know what men are like.
- Oh, yeah.
- What do you think's gonna happen the longer that we stay down here, huh?
What do you think is already happening?
- I don't know.
- I do.
Listen, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here, all right?
Don't you think you should just be a little nicer to the rest of the boys?
Especially Josh.
Fucking hands off me.
All you knew we had was this much?
That's all there is!
What do you want me to do?
- That's not all there is.
- That's just fucking wonderful, Mickey.
That's impossible. There is no way we can survive with that.
No way. No way.
You got us into this situation, now fix it.
I got us into this situation?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I was rationing them.
We're gonna fucking starve to death, Mickey.
We're gonna die of thirst, Mickey.
Where's the food?
What do you want me to do?
I'm not your nanny, you arrogant prick!
I'll bet you're just waiting for one of us to die so you can have all the food that you can fucking eat, huh?
- Oh, shit. What are you...
What is your problem, Mickey?
What is your problem?
My problem is you!
- You're fucking dead.
- And you, and you!
- You're fucking dead, Mickey.
- You're my fucking problem!
- Get back. Get out of here.
- You get out of here!
- Take a walk.
- You get out of here.
- It's my fucking...
- Take a fucking walk!
Guys, please.
Delvin, come on.
You see he's the only one not dropping any pounds?
Always stuffing his pig face.
I'm telling you, that motherfucker is up to something.
Stop playing around with that.
Okay? I'm trying to talk to you.
What do you want to do, Josh?
I want to get that fucking door open,
- even if we rip it off its hinges.
- Fucking-A right, man.
Do you agree with everything my brother says?
You mean your half-brother, right?
What, you don't agree?
Have you looked at us?
Huh?
Look at me.
We're dying in here.
Where would you rather be?
Door's welded shut.
We got one working suit.
There's not a lot of options.
There's always options.
I knew you had some stuff in here somewhere.
You crazy fuck.
It's a peace offering for...
Thank you. Uh-huh.
Back up.
Back up and open it.
All right.
Move over so I can see it.
Start again.
Don't give me an excuse to use this. Open it.
Got it.
Now push it open.
- Where's it lead to?
- The fucking White House.
- Where are the lights?
- There ain't no fucking lights.
Don't you fuck with me.
Oh, man.
Help!
It's Delvin and Mickey.
Holy shit!
What the fuck, Mickey?
This motherfucker, he comes in here and he sticks a Taser in my face, and he said he was gonna kill me unless I gave him the rest of the food and water.
Then he... he goes for the gun.
I caught him off guard.
Then we started fighting over the gun and it went off.
- It went off?
- Yeah, it just went off.
And that's it.
It was self-defense.
It was...
- It was self-defense.
- Stop!
- Get off me!
- Bobby, get him!
It was self-defense, motherfucker!
Adrien, help me!
Sam, get his legs!
Get his legs!
- Get his legs!
- Get off, motherfucker!
- Eva, get the gun!
- Get off!
- Hold on to him!
- Get off me!
It's a combination lock.
It won't work.
It's a combination lock.
Somebody wake him up.
You know what I think?
I think we should kill the maniac right now.
- Jesus, Bobby.
- Hey, Mickey.
- All right, let's fucking do it.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby.
Let's get civilized about this, please.
- Come on. Josh?
You saw what he did to Delvin.
Huh? The guy's a whack-job.
He has been fucking with us since the first...
You know what?
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Eva.
You don't even know what happened.
- Give me the gun.
- Let's get to the bottom of this first.
- What are you doing? You bitch!
- Josh.
- What if those guys come back, huh?
- Josh, come on.
Get the fuck out of my way.
Fuck.
We need the fucking combination, Mickey.
The combination.
- Aah!
- What is the combination?
Sam.
What's behind that door?
Put his head forward.
- Aah!
- What's behind that door?
- What's behind that door?
- You're gonna die.
- You're all gonna die.
- Huh?
I'll never give you the combination.
Go get the knife.
- No?
- I don't care what you do to me!
You can kill me!
I don't care if I die!
- You don't care if you die?
- No! I kind of want it.
- Aah!
- Huh? You want to die?
As long as I'm strapped in this chair, I'm stronger than you.
You're never gonna get that combination from me.
- Never!
- No?
And I will starve to death.
Will you?
- Bobby!
- Give me the fucking combination,
Mickey, or I'll slice you from ear to ear.
- You hear me?
- Stop!
- You're so fucking dead.
- No! Get off of me, you faggot!
Get off of me, you faggot!
I'll starve to death.
Put the knife down, you guys, please.
You shouldn't have thrown the gun down the toilet, Eva.
- Fuckers! Fuckers!
- Come on, Josh, think about it.
- What's the combination?
- Fuck you!
- Put down the knife.
- Yeah, do it.
- Josh, no!
- What's the combination?
- Put down the knife.
- Do it! Do it!
Josh, no!
- Stop!
- What's the...
Let her go, Josh.
Let her go. Let her go.
I don't know why you wanna fight, boy.
Okay, okay, Josh.
Josh, look at me.
- Look at me.
- Stop it, Josh!
- I'll cut that pretty neck of yours.
- Fuck you!
- Keep the fuck back!
- Look at me, Josh. Look at me.
I think it would be a better idea before we torture someone, you let your anger pass.
If I have to calm down and rationalize this,
I don't know if I'll be able to take a knife and cut his fucking fingers off.
- Do it!
- No.
Last chance, Mickey.
How about that?
How about that's your last chance, you fuckin'...
- Go ahead. Do it.
- Fucking yuppie.
- Do it. Do it.
- Do it. Do it.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Do it. Go ahead.
Go ahead and do it!
Do it, faggot, do it!
How's that feel, huh?
How's that feel?
- How does that fucking feel?
Oh, God.
It's okay. It's okay.
Look at that. Look at that.
There it is, huh?
- See how easy that thing came off?
- Hey, Josh, let's do another one.
- Another one?
- Yeah. Let's do a thumb.
- You want a thumb?
- Nine!
- Nine, motherfucker?
- No!
- What's the combination?
Mickey, give him the combination, please!
Okay. Okay.
- Nine.
- Nine. Come on.
11, then zero, then one.
Now he's a fucking canary.
That wasn't so hard, was it, Mickey?
Go get the door open.
9-11-0-1 . Go.
Just fucking go!
You faggots!
Faggot, you'll never amount to anything.
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
You're a fucking coward!
- Coward!
- Nice souvenir, huh?
- Yeah.
- You fucking cowards!
Hey, Mickey, I got you in my pocket now.
Oh, that's funny.
You're real funny, you stupid shit.
A fucking brain the size of a fucking pea, you fucking idiot.
You red-headed stepchild.
And you, you fuck!
You're a fucking coward, man.
Fuck you!
Mickey.
Mickey.
Won't you play with me?
Ooh, they got beans.
See, I told you he was holding out on us.
We should still kill him.
Shut up, Bobby.
What did you find?
Nothing.
Hey, Mickey, you want to see a magic trick?
Now you're not alone.
You fucking missed.
You missed.
You want it, Sam?
Oh, my God.
Oh, God damn it.
That's disgusting.
Marilyn.
- Don't waste that, Marilyn.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Clean yourself up.
Let me massage you.
No, it just... it hurts.
- All right? Just...
- I can make you feel better.
No, just... just stay off me, all right?
Marilyn, I don't think he wants to be touched.
You stink, okay?
Just stay off me.
I said get off of me!
Stay.
Marilyn, why don't you put some clothes on?
That filthy nightie is disgusting.
I can't even eat.
Well, thanks, Sam.
Now why don't you go over there and suck on his dick?
You should suck his dick because we all know that he's not getting any at home.
What, Sam, her pussy like the fucking Sahara or something?
All right, Josh, let it go.
Marilyn, let me ask you a question.
Why is it that old women can't age gracefully?
Your tits are at your waist.
Someone pulled the ripcord on your inflatable ass.
And your skin is like fucking sand...
- Josh, leave her alone.
- Stay out of it!
- I'm not a child.
- No, she's not.
But I like that.
Stop it.
Oh, what?
Yeah.
Oh, you, too, Sam?
Yeah, go fetch her, boy.
Eva.
- Eva.
- I can't stand it in here.
- Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Sam.
- Sam.
- Come on, Eva.
- Sam, please stop. Please stop.
- Please, please, please.
- Sam, just go away.
- Please, please.
- Sam, stop it.
- Eva, please.
Sam, get off of me!
Josh, do I look like a space alien? Huh?
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Hey.
Yeah?
How about a drink?
Sure.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Cheers.
Thank you.
I should go.
Yeah.
Liz?
I'm so sorry about everything.
Come on, you motherfuckers!
Come and get me!
I got nine more fingers for you!
Hey, Marilyn.
- It's gonna be okay.
- Where are you, baby?
- It's gonna be okay.
- Bring back that sweet ass.
- You stay with us. Don't worry.
- Marilyn.
- You stay with us.
- Oh, there she is.
- She got off the leash again.
- It's okay.
Marilyn. Marilyn.
Come back to bed.
She's gonna stay in here with us, all right?
Josh, let her stay in here.
- Marilyn.
- No!
Come on, let her go.
Let her go.
- Let her go!
- Eva, she's yours.
Marilyn! Marilyn!
- Let her go!
- Eva, wait, wait.
- Let her go!
- Wait, let it go.
Aah! Fuck!
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. I'm fine.
Sorry to interrupt.
You guys have to Mickey-sit.
And Josh would like to see you alone.
This looked like your size.
What do you want, Josh?
Decided you should ration your own food and water.
Is this for the three of us?
No, two.
Mickey's fasting.
Okay.
Of course, Eva, if you want more,
I'm open to barter.
No?
Maybe I'll just take this back.
What's going on?
I'm rationing the supplies.
Yeah, well, Josh, they're the group's supplies.
It's not your call.
Well, groups break down into self-interest during times of scarcity.
And someone needs to make the tough decisions during times of war.
It's in the DVDs.
So what's next, huh?
You cut off Bobby?
Then me?
Bro... there is only us.
Let's do it again.
Oh, God, more. More.
- I have to ration it.
- Ration your end.
This is our end.
This is what Josh gave us.
Get me out of this chair.
You held out on us, Mickey.
I was gonna tell you about the food.
But first I had to make sure that when this supply ran low, who I could trust and who would go bad.
Eva, come here.
- Come here. Eva.
- What?
Come here.
There's something in the storage room they don't know about.
- What?
- It's a gun.
Sam.
You have to do something.
What the fuck are you talking about?
He told me there's another gun.
He's a compulsive liar and a fucking murderer.
If you won't help me,
I'll do it alone, Sam.
What are you gonna do when you find that fictional gun?
Are you gonna kill them?
We can't provoke them.
I can talk some sense into them. Yeah.
I was a fucking lawyer, remember?
I was a fucking...
Sam, wake up.
You were nothing, just a fucking drug addict living on the streets.
So don't you dare to tell me to wake up.
You got to be a cowboy.
Cowboys touch penises.
- Do it. Do it.
- No, no.
- I'm not gonna touch it.
- Touch it.
- No way.
- He doesn't want to touch it.
- He doesn't want to do it.
- Do that other thing.
- The big one?
- The big one.
- What did I just say?
- The little one.
- But you said...
Little dog.
The little one.
The little one is a...
The little one choking.
The little one choking.
- Give him a treat.
All right, here we go.
- Eva beaver.
- Wow.
- Come on in.
- No, I just need to talk to Sam.
Well, we're in the middle of a game here.
Sam, I need to talk to you.
- I haven't finished yet.
- He hasn't finished.
Oh, don't worry about Marilyn.
She's zoned out.
You know what?
You should play.
Yeah, come on.
Come on in.
I insist.
There we go.
There we go.
Get her a drink, Sancho.
Thank you, maître d'.
So, Eva... truth or dare?
I'm not gonna play.
You're gonna play 'cause you're sitting at my fucking table.
How about we play for food and water?
So come on.
Truth or dare?
Truth.
- Do you love Sam?
- Good question.
- Come on.
There's no getting out of this one, Eva.
Do you love Sammy?
Yes.
Ooh, congratulations, Sam.
And my brother?
You already asked your question.
That is true, Josh.
Those are the rules.
- That's true.
- Fuck, she got me, man.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, um...
It's your turn to ask.
So come on.
Ask a question.
It's your turn.
Come on, just say,
"Josh, truth or dare?"
Ask a question.
Okay, dare.
No, truth.
Last time I said dare,
Bobby wanted me to eat Mickey's finger.
- You're a sick fuck.
Fucking disgusting.
So come on, ask a question.
Ask a fucking question.
- Ask a fucking question!
- Did you enjoy torturing Mickey?
No.
I did what had to be done.
But what have you done for us?
Huh?
- Come on, Josh.
- Okay, fuck it, Sam.
What's up? You want a turn?
Truth or dare?
Dare.
Go cut up Delvin's body.
Come on, Sammy.
Circle of truth.
You accepted the dare, Sammy.
Time to follow through.
- I'm not cutting anyone.
- Do it.
Don't be such a chickenshit.
Huh?
Do it.
- Stop.
- Do it.
- You got a penis, Sam?
- I'm not cutting anyone.
- Do it.
- Bobby, stop it.
- Stop it, Bobby.
- Do it.
Eva, how can you be engaged to such a pussy?
- Stop it, Bobby.
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it!
- Stop it!
Atta boy.
Sam, sit down.
Sam, sit down.
Sam, don't!
Sam, don't.
Help me.
Sam, don't.
You don't have to prove yourself.
- You don't have to do this.
- All right, Sam, now remember, it's just like chopping lumber, but not.
All right, knock yourself out.
Go for it.
- Hold it high.
- No.
- Don't.
Come on.
- You fucking pussy.
- Why don't you do it, Bobby?
You love chopping up people.
Why don't you do it?
Well, you see,
I've already cut up a body.
- Give me a kiss. Right here.
- Whoo!
I think we know who the man of the house is.
- Get the fuck... get off me.
- Robert.
- Get off me.
- Get the ax.
- No, no, no, no, I can do it!
- You're gonna cut him up.
- Josh, don't!
What are you doing?
Do it or I break his arms.
Come on.
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it.
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Who's next?
Bobby.
So how's a little bit off the top?
You ready?
Okay.
Look at us, huh?
Look at us.
- Yeah.
- We're the same.
The same.
You're my brother now.
Where's the gun?
Get me out of this chair.
It's in a red coffee can in the panic room.
I never said I'd untie you.
You'll do the right thing.
Eva, there's another way out.
- What?
- Through the septics.
But you're gonna be swimming through a whole lot of god-awful shit.
You know it's in the hair?
It's in the hair.
What's the going rate on a bottle of water, Sancho?
Got to be some infidelity for sure.
- Yeah.
- No.
Stop. Stop.
She sounds like a racehorse, Robert.
I'll bet she goes off like one, too.
- Please.
- Don't spoil it.
- Please, not like this.
- Not like what?
- Robert.
- What?
- Get lost.
- I thought we could share this one.
Oh, God.
It's in the hair.
She just broke.
Hey.
- What happened?
- Marilyn's dead.
They killed her.
You okay?
What are you doing?
You have to get the gun.
In the panic room.
- Where?
- In the red coffee can.
- Hey, assholes.
- Oh, God.
You're supposed to keep the batteries charged.
We're trying to watch a movie.
Yes, Bobby, but it just died.
- All of a sudden.
- What the fuck, Sam?
It just died?
What the fuck?
Store's closed.
Not here. Not here.
Not here, please.
Please.
Come with me.
This is your fault.
You didn't fucking charge the battery.
- Sorry. Yeah, yeah, well...
- Oh, shit.
Why do you look so nervous, Sam?
Huh? Go do something.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Bobby.
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.
- Where are you going?
- I need to go to the toilet.
I'm sorry, Bobby.
You're right.
Wait. Wait.
Why don't you just slow down?
Oh, bitte. Oh, bitte.
Oh, bitte.
Oh, bitte.
Oh, bitte.
- What are you doing, Sam?
Well, you said you were going to the bathroom.
The bathroom's down the hall and to the left.
I'm just starving, Bobby.
I need something to eat.
Okay.
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.
You know, I'm standing here and you're standing there, and we're both thinking the same thing, aren't we?
What?
Please, get me out of this chair.
Get me out of this chair.
Get me out of this chair.
Please, get me out of this chair.
Are you my friend, Sam?
Yes, I'm your friend.
What... what are you doing, Bobby?
Will you be my Sancho, Sam?
- Your what?
- My Sancho.
- Sancho Panza?
- Sure.
What? Sure.
Yes, I'll be your Sancho...
Say please, pussy.
Pussy?
- Please.
- Please.
- Pussy.
- Pussy.
- Please, pussy.
- Please.
- Pretty please, pussy.
- Pretty please.
- Pussy. Not just pussy.
- Pussy.
- Pussy. Pussy.
- Pussy. Pussy.
Now say it in French.
I don't know what you just said, but that sounded sexy as fuck.
- Now suck my dick.
- What?
- Suck my dick. Suck my dick.
- What? No.
- Suck my dick!
- No, no, no!
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, Bobby.
- Bobby, come on.
- Suck it.
- Bobby. Bobby, come on.
- Suck my dick.
- Suck my dick.
- Bobby!
- Bobby, stop! Ah!
Stop it!
Stop!
I'm just fucking with you, Sam.
Yeah, we changed the combination two weeks ago.
Open sesame.
I don't think we have croissants.
I know how you Frenchies love that shit.
But I'll find you something.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I don't want to just fuck you.
Wait, wait, please.
You were right about Sam.
Sam's not a real man like you.
You're right.
I need a real man.
What are you doing?
I want to touch you.
I just want to touch you.
What, I said, are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I just wanted to touch your skin.
- You want some apricots?
- Apricots are for faggots.
I like apricots.
You know, Sam, you really blew it big time.
You know, I knew
Josh would tap that ass.
You really blew it.
What the fuck are you doing, Sam?
Shh.
Shut up.
Shh.
- Josh!
- Shut up!
- All right.
- Stand up.
Stand up.
Now march.
Come on, Sam.
No!
I'll fucking kill you!
Get off!
Get off her!
Get off of her!
Run, run!
I've got the gun.
- I've got the gun.
- Sam.
I've got a gun!
I've got a gun.
Come on, Sam. If you shoot me, you're gonna have to cut me up.
Sam, keep the gun on Bobby.
You'll never do it, pussy.
- Come on, shoot me.
- Sam!
Shoot me.
Come on, shoot me.
- Shoot me!
- Keep the gun on Bobby.
- Sam, I'm on your side.
- You'll never do it, pussy.
- Sam, give the gun to Adrien.
- I'm on your side.
- Shoot me!
- Give the gun to Adrien.
- Sam, give me the gun.
- Sam, give the gun to Adrien.
- Shoot me.
- Give the gun to Adrien.
- What?
- Give the gun to Adrien.
- Okay, I'm on your side.
- Fucking shoot me.
Damn it, I'm on your side.
Give me the gun.
- Shoot me!
- Give me the gun, Sam.
- Shoot me!
- Give it to Adrien!
- Sam!
No! No!
Fucking do him.
Fucking do him.
Fucking do him. Huh?
Fucking do him.
Come on, you fucking pussy.
Fucking do him.
You gonna puss out on me now? Do it!
Come on, cunt.
Fucking do it.
- Fucking do it.
Do him.
Come on.
Come on, buddy boy.
Hey. Hey.
Eva! Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!
Are you proud of yourself?
Sam, come on.
That's gasoline.
Eva!
Eva! Eva!
Open the fucking door!
Eva, come on.
Open the fucking door!
Eva! Eva!
- Eva!
- Eva!
- Eva!
- Eva!
- They changed the numbers.
- What?
They changed the fucking combination.
What's the new combination?
- What's the new combination?
- They didn't tell me.
Eva!
Eva.
Don't let us die.
I'm sorry, Eva!
Eva! Eva!
Eva...
Eva!
(Whimsical score playing)
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Here's a menu.
- Thank you.
I'll be right back with you.
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?
I don't mean to bother you.
What?
I feel I know you from somewhere.
Really?
Yeah, did you go to
San mateo high school?
- Yeah, how'd you know that?
- I went there too.
- So are you from here?
- Not really.
My mother lives up here but I'm from San Francisco.
What about you?
San Jose.
I remember you now.
You were in my English class.
- I was?
- Yeah, I sat two seats behind you.
- You remember that far?
- Yeah.
So what do you do?
I'm a fashion model.
And a beautiful one too.
Thanks.
Well, it was nice talking to you,
But I should really get going.
I've got an audition for a modeling job.
So it was good talking to you.
Same here.
Nathalie.
Oh, hi again.
I was wondering if we can keep in contact.
Sure.
Here's my card.
- Here's mine.
- Again.
Again, it was nice talking to you.
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.
This morning flocks of seagulls and crows
Were found dead in downtown San Jose
And along highway 101.
The crows and seagulls also caused an accident
On highway 101 near the 1st street exit.
Authorities are investigating the cause of their death.
In other news today, the population
Of polar bears is declining rapidly
Due to the melting of sea ice in the arctic.
As the sea ice melts, the polar bears
Are forced to move farther north.
Although some have survived, many have died from starvation
Due to the difficulty of finding enough food such as seals.
What does it take to win your business today?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, I'll give you that and a 50% discount.
Can we close the deal today?
Can I place your order today?
Great, thanks.
We appreciate your business.
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, what's with all the noise?
Caught the big fish.
Yeah?
How big was the sale?
$1 million.
- Awesome, man.
- Biggest sale of my career.
I'm proud of you.
Nathalie?
Hey, Christine.
What's up?
I have great news for you.
Victoria's secret wants you
To become their cover girl model.
You're kidding.
No no, it's the real deal.
That's great.
Yeah, of course I'll do it.
Thanks for getting me the gig.
You are welcome.
You worked very hard.
So here's your chance to impress them.
Congratulations again.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
Okay. All right.
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Thank you again.
All right.
Okay, bye, Christine.
Thanks.
Okay.
- Hello?
- Nathalie?
Who is this?
It's rod.
Oh, the guy from the restaurant.
What's up?
Hey, it was nice running into you at half moon bay.
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.
So how's your day?
It's going well.
How's yours?
Great.
I made a big sale today.
Good.
Fantastic.
Thanks.
I closed a big job offer today
With Victoria's secret,
Wow, congratulations.
I think you'll look great in those lingerie.
Thanks.
So how about dinner to celebrate your success?
- That was fast.
- I know a good vietnamese restaurant.
Sounds delicious.
I'll see you then.
Yes.
Yes.
Man, all air.
Whoo.
This heat's killing me.
I know, man.
What's with this weather?
A heat wave in winter?
I don't know.
Let's call it a day.
I met this girl nathalie over the weekend.
Good for you.
Is she hot?
- Yeah. Fashion model.
- Lucky you, man.
Yeah, we're going out this weekend.
Hope you score with her, man.
Is that all you ever think about... is sex?
Anyways, we're just gonna go to lunch.
Just talk.
Get to know each other.
A day without sex
Is a day wasted, man.
I'll let you know how it goes.
Anyways, I heard n.C.T.
Is going to be acquired by oracle.
- Really?
I hope that's true, man.
- I know it's true.
You know, if that happens, we'll all be millionaires.
Yeah.
There was a wildfire today in the Santa Cruz mountains.
Dubbed the St. Martin wildfire,
It has already burned through
30,000 acres of trees
And has destroyed over 100 homes.
Currently there is 0% containment of this fire.
However, firefighters are hopeful
That within the coming days the weather will become more favorable
And help to extinguish the St. Martin wildfire.
In other news, the first green grand prix event
Was announced today in San Francisco.
All cars for this racing event will be powered
With hybrid or electric technologies.
Parts of the streets of San Francisco
Will be used as the racing course
And the drivers will be
Hollywood celebrities.
Hi, my name is Jerry Owens.
I'm from solar power accessories.
We have an appointment today.
Oh, yeah yeah.
Come on in.
Here's that estimate
I was telling you about.
Wow, $20,000 for a 3 kilowatt solar panel?
Yes.
Where are you gonna put it?
Come and I'll show you.
And that, sir, is where we're going to install your solar panel.
Okay.
Huh.
$20,000, huh?
Is there any way we can lower the price?
For you, sir,
I'll knock off $1,000.
- $1,000, huh?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do it.
- All right.
Hi, nathalie.
Hi.
Hi.
This is for you.
Thanks.
That's sweet.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
So why did you decide to go into sales?
I like sales.
It fits my personality.
I started out as a software engineer,
A b.S. In computer science.
Software development was boring for me.
And I felt I was more of a sales and marketing type.
So I switched to a high-tech sales career.
That's interesting.
Some of my friends say that my b.S. Degree
Stands for bullshit because
I was too much of a salesman
And not enough engineer.
Very funny.
I work at a start-up company called n.C.T. Software.
Got the stock option.
Hopefully if the company makes it big
By being bought out or goes public,
I'll exercise that stock option,
Cash out and walk away with tons of cash.
My silicon valley dream.
I hope that happens for you.
Thanks.
Tell me about modeling.
What do you like about it?
I love it.
It's fun and glamorous,
But hard work.
My mother doesn't see that though.
She wants me to be a real estate agent.
It's not for me though.
Do what you like, nathalie.
Follow your dream.
I have every intention.
So how come you never made a pass at me in school?
I should have.
I was too shy.
Why don't you make a pass at me now?
I thought I already had.
So what's your plan?
Family? Kids?
Whoa, now this is getting serious.
I'm just curious.
I'd probably settle down if I met the right lady.
- Hope you do.
- So do i.
So who's the right lady?
She's beautiful,
Kind, compassionate,
Honest and loyal.
- Is that all?
- Yup.
How about a nice figure?
Sexy?
That would certainly help.
What do you like to do for fun?
Watch football, especially the 49ers.
Also a part-time eagles fan.
And a little exercise...
Tennis.
How about you?
I like to go to the movies.
And I like to hang around with my best friends
And go dancing at the clubs...
Clubbing.
And I like to spend time with Alex.
Alex?
He's really cute.
Who is Alex?
And I love him to death.
Come on, let me see the picture.
Is he your boyfriend?
I can't wait for you to meet him.
Come on, let me see it.
Come on, let me see it.
All right.
Meet Alex.
You're right.
He is cute.
- So you're a cats lover.
- Yes.
If I could afford it,
I'd have at least 10 of them.
- Wow, a cat zoo?
- Yup.
You've got to be kidding.
Nope.
Beautiful, kind,
Compassionate and intelligent...
- I hope you find her.
- I will.
- That was fun.
- We should do it again.
I'd like to.
Good night.
See you next week.
Can't I come in?
Not on the first date.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Okay.
Good night.
- Hi, mom.
- Oh hi, honey.
- How are you?
- Oh, good.
I'm just fixing some lunch.
You want to stay?
I've actually got to run soon.
But I needed to pop in and see you.
I'm glad you did.
What's that smile all about?
I don't know what you're talking about, mom.
Oh, come on.
I see it all over your face.
Well, I did meet a guy.
You're kidding.
He is great, mom.
You know we went to the same high school?
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
We had lunch over the weekend and it was terrific, mom.
I mean, we hit it off right away.
He's smart and he's ambitious.
And he's interested in what I have to say
Instead of trying to get something from me.
So he's great.
Oh, that's fantastic.
Now what does he do for a living?
He's a software salesman.
Oh listen, invite him over for dinner.
I'd love to meet him.
Maybe in time, mom, when we get better acquainted.
Well, I can understand that.
You know, look, keep me...
You know, keep me informed along the way.
- All right.
- How's modeling going?
It's great, mom.
I got a job with
Victoria's secret.
- (Gasps) No way!
- Yeah.
Are you serious?
Oh my gosh.
Oh, honey, you know
I've always been supportive of your modeling career.
It's just such a tough business to be in.
It is.
Thank you, mom.
I'm well on my way.
Well, listen.
If things don't work out,
It doesn't hurt to have a secure financial husband
To support you.
Or, you know, a real estate career to fall back on.
Okay, mom.
Thanks.
You told me about a dozen times already.
You know I always love your advice.
Actually, I've got to get going.
I just wanted to drop by and say hi to you
And to tell you all about my new gig.
Well, does the gig pay well?
- Yes, it does.
- Ooh, that's my girl.
I need to get the phone.
Hello?
Hey, mai.
Yeah?
It's nathalie.
Oh, hi.
What are you doing?
What does it sound like I'm doing?
Rick is here in bed with me.
Sorry to interrupt.
Listen, do you want to go on a double date with me?
I don't know.
Why?
I just met this guy rod
And he's terrific.
Sounds fun.
I'll let Rick know.
Great.
I'll set it up.
Want to go on a double date with me?
Why not?
My friend nathalie just met someone named rod.
You remember, the fashion model?
Oh yeah.
With rod?
My buddy rod.
He was telling me last week
He met a fashion model named nathalie.
- Oh really?
- Yeah.
Man, this is gonna be fun.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Please help me give a warm welcome
For our c.E.O.
Bill star.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have some great news.
Our board of directors has agreed to the acquisition
Of n.C.T. Software by oracle corporation
For $1 billion.
A billion.
A billion.
You guys...
You guys have worked hard
And you've all earned your stock option.
Congratulations.
You you you you and you.
So I guess the meeting's adjourned.
Congratulations.
Good work.
You bet.
You bet.
- Congratulations.
- Way to go, bill.
The negotiating man.
Oh yeah!
- Thank you so much.
- What are you getting with your money?
So now you've got a big payday with your big stock option, huh?
Yeah, I earned it.
All those big deals
I did with n.C.T.
And millions of dollars in revenue and sales.
Well, you've done a great job, rod.
And we appreciate your contribution.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You like it?
I'm gonna get the real
Ferrari spider f430 soon.
So what are you gonna do with your newfound wealth?
I think I'm going on break.
Early retirement.
No car?
Well, with that new fashion model chick
You might want to impress her with a Ferrari.
I don't think she's materialistic.
When are you gonna grow up, man?
Chicks love cars.
If you want to get into their pants,
You'd better have a nice hot Ferrari.
She's my hot Ferrari.
Besides, I love my mustang, which is a plug-in hybrid.
It gets 100mpg.
Anyways,
I'm thinking about
Opening up a green tech company.
Really?
Oh, by the way,
I know your girlfriend nathalie.
She's my girlfriend's best friend.
- Huh, small world.
- Yeah.
And they're planning on setting us up for a double date.
- It's gonna be fun.
- Yeah.
Man, that was a good movie...
"an inconvenient truth."
That is it.
I'm getting myself a car that's environmentally friendly.
- Yeah.
- Good, you're finally listening to me.
That's right.
Hey, mai and I got to get back to work.
So, uh...
Just trot off.
Work?
Yeah, you know, sensual work.
Oh, I see.
Understood.
Well, you guys have a good time.
Yeah, all right.
With mass solar's nano-based solar panels,
They cost the manufacturer for one watt of electricity 10¢.
That's a fraction of the cost
Of a recurring silicon-based solar panel
Which is $4 per watt.
So a 3-kilowatt mass solar nano-based
Solar-powered system would probably cost around
At this price everyone can afford solar power
For their home or businesses.
With these panels,
Solar power will be available and affordable for everyone.
No need for leasing or financing
An expensive $20,000 silicon-based solar panel.
Is there a patent?
Yes, mass solar owns the patent to this technology.
Good.
Who are your competitors?
Companies like sun power, silicon valley solar.
But these companies' solar panels
Are based on silicon technology,
Which is very expensive to manufacture.
That's why it's for $4 per watt.
On the other hand, mass solar's manufacturing process
Is simple, it's low cost
And it uses nanotechnology.
That's why we're able to deliver 10¢ per watt.
So how much funding are you requesting?
$10 million.
Guys, this is revolutionary green tech.
Contingent upon agreement on our terms sheets,
- we're going to fund you.
- Awesome.
- Oh, lovers on the moon.
- Yeah.
Oh, look how cute.
The sea is so beautiful.
Yes, it is.
You know, all life came from the sea.
I mean, look at us.
We're made of water.
So...
So what is your ideal man?
Well, for one thing,
He has to have a lot of stock options invested.
At least you're honest.
He has to be kind, honest,
Successful, ambitious,
And opportunistic.
- Is that all?
- Yup.
So do you have, like, a backup plan,
You know, if your modeling career doesn't work out?
Not really.
I figure if I don't make it big by the time I'm 30,
I figure I'll just take it from there.
You should have a plan b now.
I always do.
I mean, look at me.
I started out as a software engineer
And ended up a salesman.
You sound like my mother.
Good advice though.
Who knows? Maybe I will consider a career in real estate,
Or even becoming a wife
Of a successful entrepreneur.
Look at these birds.
Stop, don't touch it.
It may be infectious.
- Oh hi.
- Hi, mom.
- How are you?
- Good good.
- This is rod.
- Hi, rod.
- So nice to meet you.
- Likewise.
Come on in, you guys.
Good to see you, honey.
Come on in.
Rod, nat tells me
That you are a very successful salesman.
She did, huh?
I am very passionate about my career.
So nathalie tells me you recently retired.
Yes, I did.
And she mentioned that you were gonna take an early retirement.
Yeah, a few months.
Just taking a little break.
So are you enjoying your retirement?
I love the retirement.
I was a jeweler for 30 years.
And sometimes I miss not going into the jewelry store,
But, you know,
I really like retirement.
I like to travel.
I like to cruise.
And I enjoy watching television.
And my biggest thing
Is I love to watch nat
And work with her in her modeling career.
Wow, nathalie's a lucky person to have such a loving mother.
Oh, thanks, rod.
I appreciate that.
My big thing is to make sure that she's happy
And successful in whatever she chooses to do.
Thanks, mom.
Hello.
Here's your drinks.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Can I get you anything else?
We're still looking at the menu.
Thank you.
- Hope you enjoy.
- Thanks.
I really enjoyed meeting your mother.
She seemed to really like you.
I was so lonely until now.
So do you think
I'm that right lady?
Maybe.
Do you think
I'm the ideal man?
Perhaps.
You know, rod,
I was just kidding
About the stock options,
Shopping and money and all that.
All I want is you.
Are you sure?
Definitely.
Guys are usually just into me for my looks and sex.
But you're not like that.
You're a real gentleman.
I feel like you really respect me.
That means a lot to me.
I feel like I could be with you for a long time.
Then I'm one lucky man.
I think my luck has changed since I met you.
Really?
Why's that?
Last week the company n.C.T.
Software that I work for
Was bought for $1 billion by oracle corporation.
And this week my start-up company that I founded,
Mass solar, got funded $10 million
By evergreen capital.
Wow.
You said that might happen.
Congratulations.
Thanks.

So?
What do you think?
You look divine.
Rod.
What is it?
I think they're eagles.
What in the world?
Battery is dead.
What's going on?
Can they get in?
Not for the moment.
Rod, they're breaking in through the window.
Hurry, let's barricade it with the bed.
Hurry!
That should hold 'em.
I think they're gone.
Well, do you know why they stopped?
I don't know.
Maybe they got tired.
Why would birds do something like that?
I mean, why would they just attack?
I don't know.
Anybody in here?
Come on.
- Name's rod.
- Ramsey.
- This is nathalie.
- Nice to meet you.
- My girlfriend Becky.
- Hi.
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we're all right.
- I guess.
- Man, those birds were attacking all night
Then they just suddenly stopped.
We'd try to drive away but
I can't find my car keys.
- I lost them somewhere.
- They were attacking us too.
We have a van outside.
- You guys are more than welcome to come.
- Yeah, come with us.
Thank you.
We need something to protect ourselves.
Use these.
Here you go.
All right.
Let's all get our backs to each other.
That we can see the birds coming from every direction.
- Okay.
- Just like this.
- (Exhales)
- All right, ready?
- Rod: Let's go.
- Let's go.
Here they come!
Open the door.
Becky:
The door's stuck.
The door's stuck.
Hurry up.
I can't hurry up.
Damn birds scratched me.
Becky, hand me a gun.
Rod, drive.
Here, rod.
Take a pistol.
Let's go.
Hey, there's dead people on the side of the road.
Let's go see if there's any survivors.
Okay.
Becky, cover us.
I'll check out this car, you check out the other.
Okay.
They're dead.
Come on, honey.
Come over here.
Come out from under the car.
Come on.
No, I don't want to come out.
The birds will bite me.
No they won't.
Come on.
I'll protect you,
I promise.
I'm scared.
They killed my mommy.
They killed my mommy.
- It's the birds!
- (Gunfire)
Boy:
Help!
Help!
Let me out!
- Help!
- Run for it.
Let's go.
Help!
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
- (Gunfire)
- Come on!
- Let's go.
- Come on.
What's your name, sweetie?
Susan.
We're gonna make this feel all better.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
- Oh, you want to play?
- Okay.
I'm hungry.
I've been under the car for a long time.
Yeah, me too.
I'm starving.
Hey, the kids are getting hungry.
We should stop and get some food for them.
And some for us too.
There's a convenience store close by.
We'll stop there.
Becky, watch Tony while he sleeps, okay?
I'll stand guard.
You go get food and water.
Okay.
You want to get some candy?
Okay.
- Get some for Tony too.
- Okay.
Let's go, guys.
The eagles are coming.
Come on, guys.
Let's go.
The eagles are attacking.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, look.
There's an old guy on the bridge.
Hey, mister.
What the hell are you doing out here?
Hey hey!
Stand back!
These birds are contagious.
Now go away.
Hey, I thought I told you to stand back.
These birds are contaminated.
They have bird flu virus.
Now go away.
Could we just talk about it at the picnic area?
You want to talk?
Okay.
All right.
We'll talk.
Guys, this is
Dr. Jones.
How do you do?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sir, don't you know that these birds are attacking people?
- These birds?
- Yes.
No way.
They're dead from the bird flu virus.
- Bird flu virus?
- How do you know this?
I just tested their blood.
Then why are they attacking us?
I don't know.
But what I do know is global warming is causing viral diseases
Such as bird flu, west nile virus and SARS.
So what are you saying?
That global warming is causing these birds to attack?
No.
I'm a scientist...
An ornithologist.
I can't state any scientific fact without evidence.
But there is scientific evidence to show
That because of our burning of fossil fuels
And creating greenhouse gasses
Which is causing global warming,
It's raising the temperature of the seas
And species like the krill are dying.
So many bird species can't find food
Like the neritic krill.
They eventually starve and die,
Wash up on the shore.
There's also evidence that global warming
Is interrupting the birth, mating and migration cycles
Of many species.
In fact, in the last few years
40 species have become extinct because of global warming.
However, there is interesting research
That in prehistoric times
Birds did attack cavemen.
They used to claw at their eyes and skull.
They'd either leave them for dead or then come back
Because their injuries were so bad
And finally finish off the kill.
If they attack me,
I've got a little present for them.
Well, you certainly know a lot about birds.
Well, I should.
I'm an ornithologist.
I study and work with birds for a living.
You should come with us.
It's safer.
I don't need protection.
I can take care of myself.
I've got my truck and my trailer.
Besides, I'm not worried about the blackbirds.
They're not the dangerous animal.
It's the human species that's the dangerous
And menacing and terrifying animal.
Because of his fossil fuel related activities,
He's causing global warming.
It's killing life and earth itself.
It's the human species
That needs to quit playing cowboy with nature.
We must act more like astronauts,
Spacemen taking care of our spaceship earth.
Well, nice meeting you.
Good luck.
Where's Becky?
She's taking a shit.
Nathalie's watching her back.
You're pretty good at shooting.
How come you're still not in the marines?
I just got tired of all the fucking killing in Iraq.
Why can't we just give peace a chance?
Right there.
- I'll cover you.
- Okay.
- (Screeches)
- (Screams)
Oh my God, she's dead.
Rod!
Rod!
Ramsey!
She's dead.
I couldn't do anything.
She's dead.
What do you mean she's dead?
- (Birds screeching)
- Let's go!
Come on, let's go!
The eagles killed Becky.
Fucking killed Becky.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Ramsey.
They got to her before
I got a chance.
I don't know what to do.
Hey, those people on that bus are being attacked by those birds.
- (Screeching)
- (People screaming)
- Let's go save them.
- We can't. We have no room.
- It's full in here.
- They killed Becky.
What if it was nathalie?
- (Birds screeching)
- (Gunfire)
Please help me!
Help!
Come on.
I've got to get out of here.
Ramsey:
Come on, guys, let's go.
The birds are gone.
No they're not.
They're not gone.
They're gonna kill us if we go out there.
Come on, let's go.
I don't want to.
They'll kill us.
Rod, I'm gonna go get those people.
- Cover me, okay?
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.
- No.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- No.
- Come on.
- No.
Let's go.
Help me! No!
I don't want to go!
- Come on.
- No no!
- I don't want to go!
- Let's go.
- No!
- Don't make me go out there!
- Follow me.
- (Gunshots)
- (Gasps)
- (Screaming)
I'm going out there to save them.
Don't go.
If you go out there you'll die.
They're dead already.
Yeah, you're right.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hi.
The eagles killed our friends.
Do you have a phone I can use to call the police?
No, I'm sorry.
All phones from the eagle attack...
All phones are dead up here.
Really?
Damn it.
Well, we need some gas.
Well, you know, from the eagle attack
We are short on gas.
But it's $100 a gallon if you want.
What? $100?
That's outrageous.
Well, either you take it or leave it.
I have only a few gallons left only.
It's a rip-off.
Fine.
Thank you.
Tony, Susan, can you guys go get some water over there?
Then you can go get candy for yourselves.
- Yay.
- Okay.
Hey, look at that man up there.
We should stop and help him.
Okay.
- Howdy.
- Hi.
Can you sell me some gas for my truck?
We only have a few gallons and we need them.
We just bought some for $100 a gallon down the street.
$100 a gallon?
I've only got 50 in my wallet.
- We can give you a ride.
- Oh, no thanks.
Sorry, but we need it.
- You're gonna sell me some gas now.
- Whoa, take it easy.
Take it easy.
I've got an extra tank in the back.
Good.
Get it.
Rod, let's get out of here.
There's a creek over there.
We can get some fresh water.
Okay.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Come out or I'll shoot.
Don't shoot.
Peace, man.
Come down here.
Why were you hiding in the trees?
This is my home.
I live here.
That's my house.
You live in a tree?
Sure do.
So you're a tree hugger?
You could put it that way.
I love trees.
They're my family.
I look out for them and protect these precious redwoods.
So you can play in your tree house?
Sure.
Yes, that'll be fun!
No way, it's too dangerous.
The eagles might come there.
Oh, they won't.
You're very safe here in the forest.
Haven't you noticed those eagles
Seem to be going after people in their cars and gas stations?
Besides, it's not the eagles
I worry about.
It's the dry drought weather that's killing these trees.
There's not enough rain and water.
Even worse, the spruce bark beetles are eating
These trees to death and turning them from green to red.
I remember when those beetles used to die out during the winter.
But now with the dry climate they've multiplied
And taken over the forest.
Take a look at that dead redwood up there.
That was killed by a bark beetle.
This damn global warming.
It's the cause of dry climate and bark beetles
And death of the trees and forest.
I can protect these trees
Against greedy lumber companies
And bad campers who start forest wildfires.
But it's impossible to protect them against global warming.
- What's your name?
- I'm tom hill.
I'm rod. This is nathalie,
Susan and Tony.
You can come with us.
Oh, I can't.
This is my home.
I have to stay here to protect these trees from further harm.
Enjoy and appreciate these trees while you can.
In a few years they'll be gone.
- (Growling)
- I hear a Mountain lion.
I've got to get back to my house.
You'd better get to your car.
It was very nice meeting you.
You too.
I think it's this way to the van.
- No, it's this way.
- Are you sure?
What's that smell?
Smells like wood burning.
It's a forest fire.
Let's go, come on.
This way.
- You see that lighthouse over there?
- Mm-hmm.
That's where mai lives.
We should stop by and see if she's there.
Okay.
- Oh my God.
- What?
That's mai's car.
- We should pull over.
- Okay.
Oh God, mai.
Mai, are you okay?
Mai.
Nat?
Mai.
Forgive them...
Mai.
Mai?
Mai!
God.
Mai.
Damn it!
We ran out of gas.
What are we gonna do?
If we're lucky someone might drive by.
- I'm hungry.
- Me too, I'm hungry.
We've got to find a way to get them some food.
- What should we do?
- I don't know.
Hey look, a fishing rod.
I can go catch some fish.
Oh look, a stove.
We can cook it.
Hey, good idea.
Hey, nat.
I'll go fishing over there.
How about you and the kids go get some seaweed?
Okay.
You guys eat seaweed?
Seaweed's the best.
It's good for your health.
Nathalie:
Is that right?
Rod:
I caught a fish!
- He caught a fish.
- Yay!
Awesome.
I got a fish.
Looks good.
I got some seaweed.
Good.
I'm gonna go up to the van and get the stove
So we can cook this.
Here you go.
This'll be good for us.
Yuck.
I want a happy meal.
Me too.
I know, you guys.
There's no happy meals around here.
Just try the seaweed.
It'll be really good.
- No.
- No, I want a happy meal.
I don't know.
Guys.
Guys, get up.
The eagles.
The eagles.
Come on, we've got to go.
Damn,
I'm out of bullets.
Nat, you hit them if they get through windshield, okay?
Look!
They're leaving.
I wonder why they stopped the attack.

It's coming from the courtyard.
It's the Lord Commander!
Help me get him inside.
Thorne did this.
How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?
Trust?
The men in this room.
Does the wolf know you?
We need all the help we can get.
Ser Davos.
I saw him in the flames fighting at Winterfell.
I can't speak for the flames... but he's gone.
He was our Lord Commander.
He never should have been!
You all know why you're here.
Jon Snow is dead.
Who killed him?
I did.
And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle.
- Murderers!
- Traitors!
You're right!
We've committed treason, all of us.
Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.
I had no love for him.
That was no secret.
But I never once disobeyed an order.
Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night's Watch is built.
And the Watch means everything to me.
I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night's Watch.
Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night's Watch.
He let the wildlings through our gates as no Lord Commander has ever done before.
He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered.
Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right,
I've no doubt about that.
And what he thought was right would have been the end of us.
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.
And we made it.
He'll have seen we didn't come.
Thorne will have made it official by now.
Castle Black is his.
I don't care who's sitting at the high table.
Jon was my friend.
And those fuckers butchered him.
Now we return the favor.
We don't have the numbers.
- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.
I didn't know Lord
Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing.
If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room.
We all die today.
I say we do our best to take
Thorne with us when we go.
We need to fight, but we don't need to die.
- Not if we have help.
- Who is gonna help us?
You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.
Bolt the door.
Don't let anyone in.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
She was 11 the first time I saw her.
The kennelmaster's daughter.
She smelled of dog.
I wasn't much older, but everybody was already afraid of me.
You certainly were.
Myranda wasn't, though.
What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't?
She was fearless.
There was nothing she wouldn't do.
Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over.
I wish you could be here to watch.
Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord?
Or would you rather the men build a pyre?
Buried, burned?
This is good meat.
Feed it to the hounds.
Your command of the cavalry was impressive.
Thanks to you, the false king
Stannis Baratheon is dead.
Do you know who struck the killing blow?
- No.
- A shame.
I'd reward the man.
Still, a great victory.
Do you feel like a victor?
I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.
Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?
No.
A reckoning will come.
We need the North to face it.
The entire North.
They won't back us without Sansa Stark.
We no longer have Sansa Stark.
You played your games with her.
You played your games with the heir to the
Iron Islands and now they're both gone.
I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds.
They won't get far.
I'm glad to hear it.
Without Sansa, you won't be able to produce an heir.
And without an heir, well... let's hope the maesters are right and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.
We can't stop.
We have to cross here.
- I can't.
- It's the only way to throw off the hounds.
But it's too cold. I can't.
I won't make it. I'll die.
I've seen what his hounds do to a person.
This way is better.
Over here.
Come on.
Sansa.
Sansa.
Tell them to settle down!
Stay here.
I'll lure them away.
No, I won't make it without you.
You will.
Go north, only north.
Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.
He'll help you.
See somebody, eh?
- There they are!
- Get them!
Where is Lady Bolton?
- Dead.
- Liar.
She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts.
I left her to die in the snow.
Got something!
Run!
Hyah!
Resist. Stay.
 Stay.
I can't wait to see what parts
Ramsay cuts off you this time.
Rider! Who is it?
It's a bloody woman.
No! Please!
Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again.
I will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours if need be.
I swear it by the old gods and the new.
And I vow... that you shall always have a place by my hearth
and...
Meat and mead at my table.
...meat and mead at my table.
And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor.
I swear it by the old gods and the new.
Arise.
Your Grace,
I'm sorry to disturb you.
A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor.
Myrcella.
Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
Mother.
All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now.
Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now?
Has she started to bloat?
Has her skin turned black?
Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?
I think about locking
Myrcella in a crypt.
I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.
Shh, shh.
Don't think about it.
I have to.
I have to. It's not right she has to suffer alone.
She's not suffering.
She's gone.
No one can hurt her anymore.
She was good.
From her first breath, she was so sweet.
I don't know where she came from.
She was nothing like me.
No meanness, no jealousy, just good.
I know.
I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...
- maybe I'm not a monster.
- Listen-- listen to me.
She was my daughter and I failed her.
No, I knew this would happen.
The witch told me years ago.
She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.
"And gold their shrouds."
Everything she said came true.
You couldn't have stopped it.
It's prophecy.
It's fate.
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.
You told me yourself when Father died.
You said we had to stay together.
You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours.
That was a prophecy, too.
I didn't listen to you and everything you said came true.
Fuck prophecy.
Fuck fate.
Fuck everyone who isn't us.
We're the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world.
And everything they've taken from us, we're going to take back and more.
We're going to take everything there is.
"The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men.
They scream in agony and their shame is so great, they do not feel the flames, for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed, they were saved."
I'd like to see my brother.
- Confess.
- Please.
How is he?
At least tell me that.
Confess.
I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.
Sinners don't make demands.
They make confessions.
Septa Unella.
Our other guests need you.
There.
Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.
I'll speak with her.
My brother, can you tell me how he is?
It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.
Your husband misses you dearly.
The love between a man and wife is sacred.
It reflects the love the gods have for all of us.
But sin leads us away from the sacred.
And only confession can purge sin.
I have nothing to confess.
So you believe you are pure?
Perfect?
Wholly without sin?
None of us are.
You have started down the path.
But you have many miles to go.
I always envied Oberyn.
He lived.
He truly lived.
Sailed around the world.
Fought men from every country.
Lay with the most beautiful women alive.
- And men.
- And men.
He experienced everything while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed.
But that is life.
We each have our roles.
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.
And I was born to rule.
The gods are not fools.
You would have been a lousy adventurer.
And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler.
Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?
Prince Doran.
The Princess Myrcella.
When was the last time you left this palace?
You don't know your own people.
Their disgust for you.
Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing.
Oberyn Martell butchered, and you did nothing.
You're not a Dornishman.
You're not our prince.
My son Trystane...
Your son is weak just like you.
And weak men will never rule Dorne again.
I told you I'm not hungry.
We're not here to feed you.
We're here to kill you.
You want her to do it or me?
We are family.
I don't want to hurt you.
Her or me?
You.
Good.
Smart boy.
You're a greedy bitch, you know that?
We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.
We'll be fine.
We're dressed like common merchants.
You walk like a rich person.
You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property.
I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore.
Because you have no cock.
She thinks you want to eat her baby.
- Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
- I know what mhysa means.
- Who wrote it?
- Hard to know.
Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
The Sons of the Harpy?
Very possibly.
Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren't even property to begin with.
You can see why they're unhappy.
Of course, it could also be the freed men.
Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.
It's a problem.
Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill.
Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you.
We can't fight an enemy we don't know.
The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone.
And have you started looking for that someone?
My little birds have already taken wing.
Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.
Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.
Goat?
Ram.
You think our friend got him?
Don't know anything else that can melt a ram's horn.
We're on the right path, then.
Perhaps she's tired of being queen.
I don't think she likes it very much.
She's too smart to like it.
Maybe she's flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us.
I've been all over the world.
There's no escaping men like us.
There's no escaping her, eh?
You keep coming back.
Why?
You know why.
Isn't it frustrating wanting someone who doesn't want you back?
Of course it is.
You're a romantic.
I admire that.
Sometimes I look at you and I think,
"So that's what I'll be like when I grow old."
If you grow old.
If I grow old.
I hope I do.
I want to see what the world looks like when she's done conquering it.
So do I.
Huh, an army?
Not an army.
A horde.
Dothraki?
They have her.
No.
But there has to be a price to pay for everything.
I know, but have you tried telling him that?
Thank you.
Who'd go there after what happened to that Kingsguard?
- Probably had it coming.
- Maybe so,
but I'm not risking it.
- Just can't do it.
- All right.
Honesty as well. He gets it.
Are you listening, blind girl?
Do you hear them talking?
Do any of them talk to you?
No.
So sad.
Stand and fight, blind girl.
I can't see.
That's your problem, not mine.
See you tomorrow.
Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.
We are both anointed knights.
Hear that, lads?
Nothing to fear.
I will grant amnesty to all brothers
who throw down their arms before nightfall.
And you, Ser Davos, I will allow you to travel south a free man with a fresh horse.
And some mutton.
I'd like some mutton.
- What?
- I'm not much of a hunter.
I'll need some food if I'm gonna make it south without starving.
We'll give you food.
You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like.
Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose.
But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.
Thank you, Ser Alliser.
We'll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.
Boys, I've been running from men like that all my life.
In my learned opinion, we open that door--
And they'll slaughter us all.
They want to come in, they're gonna come in.
- Aye, but we don't need to make it easy for them. - Edd is our only chance.
It's a sad fucking statement if
Dolorous Edd is our only chance.
There's always the Red Woman.
What's one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?
You haven't seen her do what I've seen her do.

Toss'em and bag'em.
Enjoy.
It's good.
Not great.
But seeing that you are a business man, Mr. Santiago.
Captain.
Captain.
My associates and I are willing to negotiate, a reasonable price.
Let's say, 100,000.
One million for the entire take,
Not a penny less.
A steep price for a small catch.
A pod of 20,000 sharks are migrating in this direction.
When we're through with it,
One million will look like a bargain.
If you're looking to negotiate, Mr.
Palmer, look for the insurance salesman.
I do believe we have a deal.
All hands on deck.
All hands on deck.
Tie the sails!
Get the fins to the gally!
Captain there is a north wind hitting us fast!
You need to get up here.
I think this is for you captain.
The deposit.
You'll receive the rest when we dock.
You know the most important thing I learned out here?
We shouldn't be afraid of the sharks.
They should be the ones to be afraid of us.
Salud.
What the hell is that?
They're called waves. They do that from time to time.
The storm is too strong. We are going to have to go around it.
Make it happen. I'm going to down below.
Captain!
Change of plans Captain. I'm going to take the money, your cargo, and what's left of the ship.
Aah!
I don't think so.
Crazy waves out there today.
Something unnatural about it.
There's nothing unnatural about everything.
Lots of scenery today.
I'm gonna focus on the waves.
You better hurry mate. The clouds are coming in.
Whoo! Reminds me of the nationals back in 04. Remember?
You totally ripped that bugger. I thought you were going to be rag dolled for sure.
You know we really don't talk like that, right?
You doing a ride-out or not?
Sure. Thanks.
It's totally cooking out here mate.
You're not kidding. It's a Mexican hurricane. Bad for them good for us.
Isn't that a drink?
Hit. Hit!
Whoo!
Good Morning California
this is Jonni Waves. That's Jonni with
with an "I". You may have noticed this
morning the unusul weather here in southern
California. The clouds coming n over the ocean
and the large waves are proving difficult
for surfers. I'm here in Santa Monica with
some breaking news about Hurricane David.
It's been pounding the west coast of Mexico.
Pushing it's way up to the coast to the
state of California. It seems o be
driving a very dangerous surf.
No kidding. Fin's out there.
Yeah but I won't worry about fin,
I mean he's the best surfer I've ever seen.
Except for me of course.
In my prime.
When was that George?
The civil war?
Eh, I'm not that old. You know I got some movies babe...
Hey! What did I tell you? You can touch everything at this bar except for me.
- Hey! Come on!
- Oopsies! Looks like you need another drink
Yeah I need one. One on the house.
One that doesn't coast me any money.
How come you never talk about that scar?
There's nothing to talk about.
I cut myself shaving.
4 bucks.
4 Bucks? I thought it was on the house. You spilled the last one.
Perhaps the silver
lining in this is that the storm
driven away the inflex of
sharks out of the area...
Yeah I hope it does. Hope it does. I hope the storm kills'em. I hope it kills them all.
Me too. You have no idea.
Tired already?
What's the last time you short boarded, old timer?
I never stopped. I just like this one rides.
Yeah. Whatever.
Alright grandpa. Ima show you how it's done.
Grandpa?
Show her how it's done, Grandpa!
Come on. Oh!
Deanna there's a shark!
Hey get outta the water!
SHARKS!
Hey Get out of the water!
Sharks! They're coming in!
Get off the beach!
Get out of the water!
Sharks! Get out of the water!
SHARKS!
Everyone out of the water now!
Everyone out of the water now! We're evacuating the beach. Everybody off the beach immediately.
Aaah!
Come here you bloody shark! Come here!
Aaah!
Baz!
Baz!
Aaah!
Just hang on. I'll let you in.
These sharks of your have no etiquette.
Etiquette?
I thought you were Australian not British.
Tasmanian buddy.
Just hang on, I'll get you in.
What were you thinking? You could have been killed.
I'm fine.
Aah!
We need a tourniquet.
Here use this.
It's just a - aah!
- Little nibble.
Aah!
Are you ok? Are you sure?
He must have wanted a snack.
Sharks don't like vegemite.
It's not funny.
Aah.
Hey. You gonna be ok?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Hey can I get some of those tasty nuts. Thank you.
And then. Are you listening? The shark opens it's mouth.
Goes to swallow fin whole but Fin
Looks at the shark - Do the look.
No, do the look.
Oh my god.
Yeah that one. And the shark goes, 'You know what?'
I'm pissing off. I'm not gonna mess with the surf champion.
Surf legend. Finley the Fin Shepard.
Ain't that right?
On you mate.
I don't believe it. You guys are nuts.
Look.
Do you see that?
- Oh yeah.
- It's a little nibble.
So he gives him a look and you give him a nibble -
No, HE gave me a nibble.
I don't know. Are you guys going back out there and do any swimming?
With the sharks?
It's a storm.
It's what's driven them all up north.
Eventually they'll go back from they came from.
I hope. But the were knocking.
Yeah knock knock knocking on your door.
And i have never seen so many and so bold.
It's just a storm. Just gotta stay out of the water for a couple days that's all.
Just a storm?
Looks like a hurricane.
I'm just happy you're ok.
Hey hey, what are you doing?
What? Do you think you're too old for me?
No, I'm your boss.
So?
So? Go get back to work.
Hey! I'm not too old for ya.
I don't think.
I'm not your boss.
Daddy issues. Hey! I'm not judging you darlin'.
Ouch!
I have daddy issues too.
- Here to issues.
- Yeah!
Who's is this?
Hurricane David is
poised to be the 1st hurricane to hit
the state of California. And it is now
barreling to the Santa Monica shorelines.
We have suffered tropical stors in the past but
we have never been hit by a storm quite like
this. Wide spread flooding is expected
and experts are saying global warming
is the reason for this
unprecedented event. We will
be back with more news as it develops.
Hello. Wexler residence.
April it's Fin.
Yeah Fin I know your voice. What do you want?
Look I'm just calling to make sure-
When did you go back to using
Wexler again?
cause that's my name.
Look Fin I'm really busy.
Just calling to make sure you and Claudia are ok.
There's a bad hurricane rolling in and I want-
Is this about money?
Because if this is about money
Fin, I told you already that-
It's the storm. I just want to make sure guys are ok.
Of course we're ok. It's barely even raining.
Look, it's really sweet that you are calling in to check in on us but Collin already checked the drains and, we're gonna be fine.
They're cleared out.
Well it's flooding here and not the plumbing. The ocean.
I think you guys should get out of town.
What are you talking about? We are 100 miles from the ocean.
You are exactly 6.6 miles from the ocean.
And on a day like today it's not far enough.
I'm gonna take you and Claudia further inland.
And what about Collin?
You know you are not the only one that can keep us safe.
We're not going anywhere.
Fine. Then let me just get Claudia.
We'll it my week for the month.
Is that what this is about?
No!
Look you are gonna see her on the 20th like you always do. I gotta go ok. Bye Fin.
Who's that?
My wife.
That is his wife.
- Yeah his wife.
- Shut up Baz.
Already everybody, listen up.
I'm closing the restaurant.
Storm is coming and it's coming fast. Get home safe everybody.
Don't forget taco Tuesdays.
George, you got to get out of here.
What's going on?
If I don't secure the bar, I'm going to loose everything.
Come on George, George wake up.
Oh! I hear an angel, I must be in heaven.
George you better wake up or I'm calling in your bar tab.
Oh, i'm up I'm up.
Hey hey, you need to go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
This is not your problem.
No! It is my problem. Because if this bar get blown over then I'm out of a job too.
Yeah, and I'm not gonna have any place to drink.
Can't argue with that one.
For an environmentalist you sure do hate sharks.
I've got fire power behind the bar. Come on come on!
Alright, grab a weapon. Grab anything you can find to defend yourself.
Give me something dangerous.,
Can I get one for the road Fin?
Huh? What?
Come on let's go let's go let's go!
George get your ass up!
Now!
Alright.
Come on kid.
Don't you ever make fun of my stool again.
Come on come on.
That's what you get for trying to eat me.
Come on come on guys let's go.
We are here live at the Santa Monica Pier,
this is what remains after
the massive storm tore through the popular attraction.
The waves also brought in sharks
which have injured dozens and
killed several people.
We'll rebuild mate.
Insurance will cover it.
L.A. wasn't built for all this water.
I'm really worried about Claudia and April.
I really gotta go check on them.
I'm coming with you.
April doesn't like you, remember?
Nah mate. She doesn't like you, remember?
She loves me. Where do you think Claudia came from?
Who's Claudia?
His daughter.
You have an ex-wife and a daughter?
I can drop you at home if you want?
I live on the beach it's obviously flooded.
No where else to go.
Looks like we're all refugees now.
I wanna go with you.
Make sure your family is ok.
Anybody seen George?
George?
Here he is.
Oh man. I'm glad you woke me up.
I was having the worst nightmare.
Gosh the water is raising.
Water is not going to be a problem.
All the electronics have been sealed with silicone. We'll be fine.
I've driven this thing from here to the beaches of Costa Rica.
Why is the car shaking.
What the hell. There are sharks on the streets.
These fish surely have a hankering for me.
It's like one taste of Baz is just isn't enough.
Hey whoa whoa whoa.
Hold up with the guns. We don't need more blood in the water.
That's a tiger shark.
How do you know that?
Shark Week.
Were'd it go?
Where did it go?
Ah geez.
Hey
It's under the car.
Well can I start shooting now?
Yea. Do it.
We got to get to higher ground.
Take the freeway. It's above street level.
You take the 10 to the 405. You're almost in
Bevelry Hills. And there is no way the ocean has washed inland that far.
What makes you an expert on
Beverly Hills George?
That's where I live.
George if you live in Beverly Hills why do you come all the way to the coast to come and drink at my bar?
I don't know. I like the view, you know.
There's the beach. There's all these scantily glad women there that pretend to like me if
I buy them a drink. And there is my seat.
My chair. My chair is always there.
Plus you don't charge 15 dollars a plock.
Yeah.
Plus there is the beautiful Nova there who I am planning to marry soon.
I sit around and think about it every night and day. Everywhere I go.
Hey!
Bloody hell.
That's the 405.
I hate the 405.
Bloody hell. What are these idiots doing?
Yeah I'll just go around them.
You need to back up. I need to get out of here!
Get back in your car. It's not safe out here.
It's just a little water.
Typical Californians are afraid of the rain.
Yeah.
Stop!
Watch it will ya.
Maybe they're not such idiots after all.
Oh my god.
It's like old faithful.
We're gonna need faith to get through that.
The water is raising behind us.
What what what?
Oh my god!
I just can't sit back and watch this.
- What?
- The sharks are swimming right at them.
They're not gonna make it.
Don't even think about it.
They're not gonna make it.
Fin! Where you going?
The sharks are falling from the freakin sky.
Here we go again.
Nova!
There's sharks out there. You don't have to go out there.
There's absolutely no reason to go out there.
Everyone needs to get to higher ground!
Puppy!
Somebody help me! Help me get my dog out!
Please help me! My dog is locked inside.
This area is flooding.
Come on, get out!
Please!
Please help!
Somebody help!
Ok. You go!
Ok. I got you princess come on.
There you go.
Come on George.
George! Come on George!
Oh Crap!
Ouch! Get off of me!
It's not gonna end.
The flood channels, the storm drains, the sewers.
It's not gonna stop at the coast.
They're going to swim everywhere.
Come on get in the car.
We've got to go through this.
What?
You've got kangaroos loose in the brain mate. We can't go through that.
The aerodynamics in this car cannot match the waves.
The waves are only gonna get bigger as the storm get closer.
Trust me, if there is one thing
I know, it's timing waves.
That's what I was afraid of.
They come in sets of 3.
One.
Two.
Three.
Whoo.
Are you ok?
I'm alright. 10 fingers. 10
Toes.
Uh, gotta love LA.
What are these people thinking?
Nothing.
Does April know you coming?
No.
But at least we'll be in the hills away from the flooding.
Alright.
It's awfully nice of you to let her new boyfriend stay in your house.
Don't remind me.
Unbelievable.
We're almost at the house.
That's too bad. I was hoping it was further up the hill.
April!
April!
Hey let us in.
Whoa! What are you doing here?
And what happened to him?
Nothing. Your Fin save my life.
He's not my Fin anymore.
And who is she?
It's Nova. She works at the bar.
Now will you let us in.
No! I told you not to come.
No! Just go away. Take your stupid friend and Baz and leave.
Nice Shot.
By the way I'm not a stripper.
Claudia!
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Claudia!
Dad? What are you doing here?
There's a big storm coming in.
It's not safe here.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Just leave.
I didn't come here to argue with you.
I came here to get you.
I don't care.
What is all the ruckus?
Awe Sheppard.
Should have figured it was you.
What are you doing here?
L.A. is drowning.
I'm going inland. I'm taking my family with me.
Finley. April is mine.
Excuse me?
My girlfriend is not your responsibility.
And unless it's the 20th of the month, which currently it's not. Neither is Claudia.
Collin, don't be rude. He's just worried about us.
Every time it rains in L.A. everyone swears it's the storm of the century.
And even if it is, Beverly Hills emergency services a second to none.
We're safe here.
There are sharks flooding the streets.
And there is now one swimming in your pool.
Are you kidding?
Shark in the swimming pool is impossible.
Collin!
Something is on my foot! I can't move!
Finley Help me! Finley!
Watch out!
Collin!
Help me! It's getting away!
Collin!
I've got your back.
Get it's nose.
Die already!
It's coming back!
- No!
- Oh my gosh!
Fin!
Ready?
Fin!
Where'd it go?
Where's it go?
- Go go go!
- Oh my gosh!
Fin hurry up, Get over here.
Nice shot.
Thanks.
Looks like it's that time of the month.
Look!
We're out of Ammo.
The eye of the storm still hasn't come to shore yet.
It's gonna get worse before it gets any better.
We got to get inland and we got to get some place safe for all of us.
Where?
I'm thinking the desert.
No, we have to go to Van Nuys to get Matt.
Matt's in flight school there.
Matt's at flight school? I thought he was vacationing at Tampa with his buddies.
When did this happen? I just talked to him.
How come no body tells me these things.
I'm suppose to be included in these conversations.
He wanted to tell you but, Collin said it was none of your business anymore.
Who's Matt?
My brother.
You have a son too?
Alright.
We got to get out of here quick.
How are we going to do that?
I'm going to push the shark out of here.
I'm gonna distract it.
When I do this, get to the car as fast as you can.
Now!
He'll be ok.
Fin!
Fin!
Come on, get in!
Move it! Move your ass!
Go Go Go!
Easy come, easy go.
The eye of hurricane David is
continuing it's relentless
pounding through the streets of Los Angeles.
And more surprisingly and most shocking
reports have been pouring in from all over,
that sharks are washing ashore.
Live sharks. And not just from the coastal
flooding but they are coming up through the drais
Do you always have this much ammo in your jeep?
Sepra Peratus.
Dad, are you really saying that right now. Can you be serious?
It means?
Always be prepared.
Thank you.
I always thought it would be an earthquake that would be the end of Los Angeles.
Or a meteor shower. Zombies even.
Yeah.
Black Plague. Aliens.
But sharks? Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah. Go figure. My luck, sharks.
Yeah your luck. Sharks.
Mine too.
I'm not gonna lie. It's kinda hot when you do that.
Again we will keep
yo updated n this storm.
This is Jonni Waves. That's
Jonni with an "I"-
Call Matt.
This is the emergency alert system.
National weather servie has issued a tornado warning
through Los Angeles County. Water spouts have
been detected in the coastal water from Orane
No kidding. You are a bit late on that one.
We got to get out of here fast.
We got to go get Matt.
The freeways will be a nightmare.
But there's a short cut if you turn right up here.
That's how I always get around the Hollywood traffic with my friends.
What are you doing in Hollywood?
Since when do you care?
Hold on.
The storm is dying down.
How can you tell?
Not as many sharks flying around.
Why you stopping. We have to go get Matt.
Don't you see that? There could be kids in there.
There's no one in there. And your kid is right here.
We got to get her somewhere safe.
This is so typical of you Fin.
You care more about other people then you do your own family.
Let's go!
Please.
I can't.
The water is raising. I'm going to go up on the bridge and rappel down.
Fin this is crazy.
Calm down guys. Calm down ok.
There's other grown ups coming ok?
Uh uh, Police Department, Fire Department.
They're going to get us out of this.
As long as we stay in here we are going to be fine, ok?
Trust me. We're gonna be just fine.
Anybody in there?
Whoa! Whoa! Be careful.
Need a lift?
I'm glad to see you.
Send the rope.
I reached dispatch right before all the electronics went out. They said someone from 911 is sending someone over.
Oh yeah? Want to wait for them?
Hell no!
I didn't think so. Who's first?
Ok, come over here honey.
Ok.
Alright Samantha you're going to be alright.
Start pulling, they are ready.
Alright you ready? Just keep looking up.
It's gonna be fine Samantha.
Here we go.
Ok, Lift her up!
Alright here we go Samantha you're going to be alright.
Go ahead.
It's gonna be just like flying.
Come on come on. Quicker, let's go.
Yes!
Yes! Alright pull'em up!
You're doing already. You're doing good. Don't be afraid.
Come on. Hold on tight.
He's up.
Alright.
Alright, who's next?
A bunch of little kids went up before me.
How hard can it be right?
Let's go.
Alright.
Go over there. Come on sweetheart.
Your dad is trying to do good here.
Give him a hand.
Are you sure this thing is strong enough to hold me?
Nope I'm not.
Great.
I'm sure not looking forward going in there after you.
Yeah.
I hate sharks. I'm from Wyoming.
You know-
I moved down here to be an actor.
Dad.
I got to go up right now!
Please!
Up up up!
Come on!
Oh god! 15 grand a year. No benefits.
Screaming kids.
Call down. It's ok. Don't Panic.
I use to hate heights. Now I'm away from sharks.
Ok let's do this now before I become hot lunch.
Watch out fin!
Watch out to the right. Watch out!
Oh my gosh be careful.
Watch your foot.
Hurry, keep going faster.
Oh my gosh!
Be careful!
Be careful Fin!
Watch out!
Fin come on! Watch out Fin!
I had just about enough of you.
Be careful Fin!
Come on.
Your ok. Oh my gosh.
Finny, look at the sky.
The storm is clearing up. Maybe it's done.
Good.
These guys are gonna get you home, ok?
Be safe.
Oh Crap.
What?
Claudia get in the Jeep!
I'm fine mom.
Get down! Get down!
You alright?
You ok?
My mom always told me Hollywood would kill me.
Start the engine.
Is that good?
Ok rev it. Rev it.
Guys it's flooding.
It's gonna be easier if we steal another car.
Then steal another car.
There's a small gas leak but it should run for now.
What is that?
It's a water spout.
Tornado over the ocean. Water gets sucked up in the air...
Are those sharks?
Yeah. Come on. Come on.
Close her up. Let's go.
Well, at least the rain is easing up a bit.
What was that?
Oh my god. Oh my god.
What the hell?
Kill it!
This is crazy!
Hit the breaks!
Get down Claudia!
Bloody hell!
Why did we stop?
It must be flooded.
Well fix it!
Mate I smell gas.
I do too. Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!
Go go go!
The gun!
Can I use you phone please?
It's been dead for hours.
Thanks.
No problem.
So what kinda name is Nova anyway?
That's the kinda name you give yourself when you don't like the person you use to be.
Hey, uh. Look, I see the way you took at my dad.
He's just gonna break your heart just like he did to my mom and I.
It looks like the eye of the storm is over.
Or maybe not.
Hey make it quick. I don't want to spend too much time here.
With these storms ravaging
the streets of Los Angeles, some religious
Apocalypse my ass.
This isn't the end of the world. Gods not angry with us.
The Aliens are not coming down.
It's the government.
Ye-ah.
With the big capital G. They're behind everything.
They know what we buy. They know what we eat. Where we go to the bathroom.
Hurry. Hurry.
They know what kinda cheese I like.
Pepper Jack.
And the weather too.
I gotta hand it to the, Sharks.
I never saw that coming.
Y-eah.
Weather satellites
they're currently tracking 3 off shore
water spouts over the pacific ocean.
Experts are categorizing this as an EF4.
With a potential to becoming ad EF5 tornado
by the time it touches down on land.
I n the San Fernando Valley all
roads are blocked and movement-
Protein.
I know how we're going to get out of here.
You know we need a car first.
I've got it covered.
Oh nice!
You're gonna need stiches and antibiotics.
And you're gonna have a hell of a scar.
That's ok. Chicks dig scars, right?
Why you driving so fast?
We got to get there fast before they clear the accident.
What accident?
Something I saw on the news
Look out!
Whoa!
This is nuts.
Now we're never gonna get to Van Nuys.
- Baz, Drive around it.
- I can't. It's blocked in every direction.
We got to get Matt before the storm picks up again.
I'm going for it.
- Are you crazy! Don't do it
- Go! Go! Go!
Whoo!
Pull your car over.
Dad! The police are chasing us.
- Hey Baz.
- Yeah.
Stop your vehicle now!
Drive faster.
No worries mate.
Fast enough for ya?
Yeah.
Pull to the side of the road.
Stop your vehicle now.
Hey Baz, is that nitrous button?
- It certainly is mate.
- What do yo say we hit that?
- Give it a go.
- Hold on folks.
Hold on to your panties ladies.
Oh man!
Whoo! Now this is fun.
I think we lost them.
Now we're talking.
Ok.
It should be smooth sailing from here.
Why is there a retirement home next to an airport?
Because old people can't hear.
It doesn't look like they've left.
Their cars are still here.
I'm gonna go look upstairs.
Ok. I'll check these rooms.
Matt?
Matt?
Has anybody seen anything?
Matt?
Matt?
It's time to leave Kansas mate.
There's no one up here.
Where is everyone?
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa!
No no no. I'm looking for Matt.
Is there a Matt here?
Matt?
Uh, yeah yeah. I'm Matt. Who are you?
Guys I found Matt com on.
Come here. He's in here.
Matt!
Dad? Mom?
What are you guys doing here?
We had to come inland to avoid the storm.
- We came in to get you.
- There's sharks everywhere.
Sharks?
Is this the best shelter you got?
Look, we don't exactly have a storm cellar.
We better find something to protect ourselves and quick.
From what?
They couldn't possibly make it all the way out here.
They can.
It's entirely possible. A hurricane can pick up marine life out of the ocean and drop it hundreds of miles away.
Hold this.
Yeah, he's right. It happened once near Alice Springs.
100s of perch fell from the sky.
Why not Sharks?
Look, what the hell is going on here?
It's a Sharknado!
Let's get inside here. Get in get in.
The news said that there is 3 tornadoes in the area. We're not safe here.
What's the fastest way to get out of here?
Can that fly?
I don't know. Let me check.
Looks pretty beat up.
Hey you know what? She'll fly.
We're not all gonna fit in here.
We can't fly in these storms.
Then what are we gonna do?
We're gonna stand and fight?
We just wait and wait here for sharks to rain down to us again.
We need to arm ourselves with something more powerful then these.
What were you thinking?
That store, It's got everything we need.
Sepra peratus.
They must have evacuated.
How are we getting in?
Guys stand back. I have the key.
Dad, I'll be right back.
I have an idea. Come with me.
Oh nice! This is what I'm talking about.
Hey, do you think you can make this work?
Yeah. I'll make it work.
Good.
Bombs.
Bombs?
Instead of letting live sharks rain down on people, we are going to get in that chopper and throw bombs into the tornadoes.
Blasting those bastards to bits.
I like it, but how is that gonna stop a tornado?
Tornadoes happen when cold and warm air meet.
Now if you drop a bomb head, right in the middle of it, You might just equalize it.
But if you miss, we're screwed.
Oh, hell no. You got a death wish? No way!
Dad, I'm the only one that could do it.
Bobby and Noellen haven't even solo yet.
What's wrong?
Your son wants to go into a helicopter and drop a bomb into the tornado.
No! It's too dangerous.
I'll watch his back. I'll be his bombardier.
Then definitely not.
Dad, we have a chance to save thousands of lives. Maybe more.
You always taught me to help others. I'm going.
He's right April. We'll work it out together.
I won't let anything happen to him.
Don't you understand you can die Matt?
Mom, we don't have any other option.
And you are not gonna stop me.
He certainly is your son.
Shopping cart?
Yeah.
Claud?
Claud?
Hey! Come on. What are you doing down here? What's the problem?
You.
Your my problem.
Are we really gonna do that now?
Now?
Look, what are you and mom doing?
You guys can barely stand to be in a room together for 5 minutes, and now
What? Cause you are saving Matt you're best friends again?
He is my son.
I'm your daughter.
You guys are always there for him and you're never there for me.
Hey get that one. No no the other one.
You don't think I try?
Not hard enough.
I came for you first.
Try to remember that.
Come on. Come on.
Hey.
I fell off a slide when I was 2.
It hurt like hell.
Now people think it's cool.
No body thinks this is cool.
What happened?
I had a tattoo removed.
I don't like to talk about it.
I was raised by my grandparents.
We I was 7 my grandpa took me fishing with one of those day charter deals with his friends.
We end up hitting into a reef and the boat went down.
My grandfather took me and put me inside this little life- raft for safety.
Everyone else was kinda swimming around trying to stay up and suddenly all these sharks just started swarming and- and then they... tried to protect me but...
By morning they were all gone.
So I floated out there for 2 days until one of those coast guard helicopters finally spotted me.
I thought I was safe but suddenly this shark leaped up and bit my leg.
6 people went into the water and one little girl came out.
The sharks took the rest.
They took my grandfather.
So I really hate sharks.
Now I really hate sharks too.
Nice work kids.
But this, this is a bomb.
Dad, the tornado is coming.
Hey!
Hey what are you doing?
In case things don't work out,
We're going to move to plan B.
Baz builds a bigger bomb, and drives this in into the storm.
That's not gonna work. It's a one way trip.
Especially with that leg.
You want to see me try?
No!
Fin, look after your family.
They are a good bunch.
It's fine.
Alright, do what you gotta do.
Don't I always?
I will.
Watch our backs.
Be careful.
Alright get ready.
Do we have enough bombs?
Sure hope so.
First time on a chopper?
Yeah.
Scared?
Hell No!
Oh Crap.
Look at all those sharks!
Look out! More Sharks!
What are we gonna do?
You got it dad.
Oh my god, there's just too many of them!
We're gonna need a bigger chopper.
- I hope this bomb idea of yours works.
- Trust me. It will.
- We're getting close. Get Ready.
- Ready?
- Yeah. Bombs. Bombs.
- Bombs. Bombs Bombs Bombs.
Careful with those Robert.
Alright, here's how you do it.
Open the valve.
First tornado coming to the left here.
Push the button. Hold it for 3 seconds. We're gonna count.
Ok.
Strike!
Whoo! Hahaha.
- Whoo! I did it!
- Told ya!
That worked!
Fin!
How's the front end looking Bobby?
I'm not a captain yet sir.
Bobby look out!
Get down!
The tornado is coming this way.
Baz!
Second tornado! Second tornado!
The tornado is headed towards the airport.
We need to destroy it before it get to them.
Why!
Baz! Baz!
Dad! You have to leave him!
It's getting closer. We have to go now of we're dead.
OK, Tell me when.
Come on. Come on.
Let's go up there!
Ok people, everybody out of the pool.
Everybody needs to get out of the pool and inside.
Yes Carl that means you. Out now please.
This is Jonni Waves
that's Joni with an "I" reporting live
as just one of these massive tornados
is about to tear through Hollywood
and it's headed on course through the
Valley and onto Van Nuys. It's about to tear
through the city of Los Aahh!
Getting close to the second tornado.
Already got another one.
Press the button down for 3 seconds.
We're gonna count together. - Ok ok ok.
Alright. 1.2.3.
Light it!
Falling sharks!
Come on let's get them inside.
Oh my god. Run! Run!
- Run! Honey!
- I can't run, I can't even walk!
Alright. Third tornado.
Look at the size of that thing.
Just stay focused.
- It's showtime!
- I'm on it!
Go it!
Alright. Strike it!
Who is that up there?
That's my son.
You must be so proud.
Yeah. Yeah I am.
Its not working.
The bomb didn't land right.
- Hey!
- We're out of bombs. What do we do?
I'll head back to base.
Turbulence is picking up.
Oh my god!
The Shark! The Shark!
- Watch out! Watch out!
- Get off me get off me!
Die already! Why won't you die!
Ooh! Oh my god!
No!
Help!
Matt!
Get everybody to safely.
Come on everybody! Let's get away from the window.
Matt! Matt!
Matt! Matt!
Come on! Come on! Get out of here.
Come here. Come on.
Are you alright?
Yeah. Yeah where is mom and
Claudia?
They're on the hill.
Where's Nova?
She - Didn't make it.
Go look after your mother and sister.
Where you going?
I'm going to finish this.
Move! Get out of the way!
Daddy!
Get out of there!
Get outta the way!
Claudia Move!
Fin!
Dad!
Dad!
Oh my god.
Dad?
Dad!
Nova!
Come on.
- Dad are you ok?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Oh my god.
Breathe. Breathe!
Come on!
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
I really hate sharks.
- Thank you! Thank you.
- You're Welcome.
I never got your real name.
Jenny Lynn.
Nice to meet you... Jenny Lynn.
Hell of a day.
My babies!
Arthur?
Daddy?
Coming.
Do you like it, Daddy?
Very much.
- You didn't look at it properly.
- Of course I did.
That's me, that's Nanny, that's Mummy, and that's you.
Why do I look so sad?
That's what your face looks like.
It is, is it?
I wish you didn't have to go away from me.
Me, too.
But we'll have the whole weekend in the countryside, won't we?
See, tomorrow, then Thursday, and then we're back together.
Not long at all.
You look just like your mother.
- Have you got the train tickets?
- Yes, we've got the train tickets.
- And you know all the times?
- Yes, we know the times.
Okay, I've got to go
. Don't want to be late.
Go, we'll be fine. We'll see you Friday.
- See you.
- Wave bye-bye.
I know you've had it rough, Kipps, and I'm sympathetic to your situation.
But we can't carry passengers.
We're a law firm, not a charity.
Good.
I take it Tomes has briefed you on Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House.
Died. Last month.
Years since I went there, of course.
The old widow didn't greatly care for visitors.
No children?
A boy. Died young.
Many years ago.
I'll let you have the details to read on your journey.
But, principally, you're going to go through Mrs. Drablow's documents.
Make sure we've got her final will.
There's a mountain of paperwork at the house.
- It all needs to be gone through. Every page.
- Very good.
We've been dealing with a local man, Jerome.
But he's not really been cooperating.
What I'm hoping, Kipps, is that you'll seize this chance to prove your dedication to pursuing a future with this firm.
This is your final warning.
Mummy?
- Mummy.
- My darling.
Mr. Kipps.
It's a boy.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Kipps.
Have we passed Crythin Gifford yet?
Next stop.
- So, you're up from London?
- I am.
Trying to sell Eel Marsh House?
You won't find a local buyer.
- Are you staying at The Gifford Arms?
- Yes.
It's a bit of a walk from the station.
I can give you a lift.
- It's on my way home.
- Thank you.
- Samuel Daily.
- Arthur Kipps.
It's a beautiful car, Mr. Daily.
First one in the county.
Still scares the locals.
Here we are.
Well, thank you.
Very good to talk to you, Mr. Daily.
Mr. Kipps?
Would you like to have supper with my wife and me tomorrow evening?
You know, we don't get to see many new faces here.
Besides, the food in there, reckon even a dog wouldn't eat it.
- That'd be lovely. Thank you.
- Night.
Good evening.
I've a room booked until Sunday. Mr. Kipps.
No, I'm not finding any booking.
My office had telegraphed ahead.
Well, we're packed to the rafters. So...
- Evening.
- Good evening.
I was just telling Mr. Kipps that we don't have any room.
Well, we can't have him out in this weather, can we?
Not in the rain.
We must have something, just for tonight.
We don't.
Unless you want to put him in the attic?
Fine.
It's this way.
Actually, I was hoping to stay till the weekend.
My son and his nanny are traveling up to join me.
I see.
If a holiday is what you're after, sir, you'd honestly be better off further inland.
It gets awfully cold here, what with the sea mists.
Sea mist. Sea mist.
It's this way.
- How old is your son?
- He's four.
Lovely age.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
In.
Hello?
Mrs. Jerome?
- Mr. Kipps?
- Yes.
My husband went to meet you at The Gifford Arms.
This is Mr. Kipps.
I made it clear to your firm that there was no need for you to make the journey.
We could have sent all the relevant documents to London.
In any event, you'll find all the legal papers in here.
Mr. Fisher tells me you're leaving today.
Not until I've taken care of all Mrs. Drablow's paperwork.
- All in there, as I said.
- No, at the house.
I'm told there's quite a substantial amount.
I don't expect to be finished until Friday, at least.
It's not possible.
The Gifford Arms is fully booked for the week.
I shall have to contact my office.
Do you have a telephone?
Not even Mr. Daily has a telephone, sir.
You'll not find one in Crythin Gifford.
Fine. I'll send a telegram.
The Post Office is closed on Wednesday morning.
The London train leaves in half an hour.
My colleague, Keckwick, is waiting outside with your luggage.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kipps.
Mr. Keckwick, a change of plans.
I'm not catching the train.
You'll take me to Eel Marsh House.
Jerome paid me to take you to the station.
- Make it six and I'll think about it.
- Six shillings?
You'll not find anyone else willing to take you there.
There you are.
- Can you pick me up at 3:00?
- I can't.
I need to get back to the mainland before the tide comes in, else I'll be stuck here for the day.
It will be out again by 5:00.
I'll come back for you then.
5:00 then.
Come on, then.
Hello?
Who's there?
Get the boy!
Keckwick!
Mummy!
Get the boy!
Constable, I'm telling you,
I heard an accident.
No one has used Nine Lives Causeway for years, sir.
Not since the little Drablow boy was drowned in the marshes.
Eel Marsh House, it's empty.
It's not, though. I saw a woman there.
Excuse me one moment, sir.
Sir, my sister needs help.
What's the matter?
What's your name, darling?
- Her name is Victoria Hardy.
- What happened, Victoria?
- Did something bad happen?
- She drank some lye.
Our mum was out.
Lye. Oh, God. Constable!
- Is she going to die?
- Constable!
It's going to be all right.
Darling, just let me look at you...
Constable!
No!
No, my baby!
Hello?
Mrs. Fisher?
It's getting late.
You'll miss your London train.
I can't leave yet.
Please don't go back to Eel Marsh House.
Why?
Mr. Kipps, you said you have a son?
Yes.
Go home to him.
Cherish him. Love him.
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
- Mr. Kipps.
- Mr. Daily.
- Glad you could make it.
- My pleasure.
I'm just bidding my son,
Nicholas, goodnight.
- My condolences, Mr. Daily.
- It was a long while ago.
There's a place ready in there for my wife and me, so we can all be together again one day.
Come.
I heard about the girl in the village.
Terrible. Are you all right?
Yes.
My wife doesn't know and I'd be grateful if you could avoid the subject.
Indeed, the subject of children altogether, if at all possible.
He would have been about your age now.
Thank you, Archer.
There you are, dear.
Mr. Kipps, I've been so looking forward to meeting you.
I'm sorry, I must look a bit of a mess.
I found myself without a room.
Well, then he must stay with us, mustn't he, Samuel?
Indeed he must, my dear.
- Arthur.
- Thank you.
The twins won't be dining with us tonight, Archer.
Samuel, I'm sure Mr. Kipps won't mind.
Not at all.
Emily!
Thank you.
There.
Now, say hello to Mr. Kipps.
Hello.
Thank you, Archer.
There.
You're married, Mr. Kipps?
No, don't gobble. That's rude.
- Any children?
- A son.
That's lovely.
You don't want to end up like us.
Wealthiest folk in the county and no one to leave it to.
- Did he tell you about Nicholas?
- Elizabeth.
That's him.
I painted that myself.
I love to paint and sketch.
It's lovely.
Nicholas loved to sketch, too.
- He still does.
- Elizabeth, please.
He wants to draw you a picture.
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth, no!
Elizabeth!
Archer, the medication!
- No.
- Medication!
No, no.
I thought some company would do her good.
Please, think nothing of it.
She's convinced it's our son speaking through her.
You don't believe in this spiritualism stuff, do you?
I didn't.
But since my wife passed away,
I don't know.
Forgive me. I didn't...
Sometimes I feel she's still with me.
Sometimes I just feel she's there. In the room.
Trying to reach me.
Well, you must be careful, Arthur.
These charlatans with all their talk about séances and contacting the dead.
They prey on those most in need.
They do more harm than good.
I think the worst they do is disappoint.
I have to keep looking.
It's not natural to lose someone so young.
But if we open the door to superstition, where does that lead?
It's just chasing shadows, Arthur.
When we die, we go up there.
We don't stay down here.
Come on. Come on. Lie down.
I'll lose my job if I don't get this paperwork done.
If Jerome gives me some help,
I can go and meet my boy.
I doubt if Jerome will be much help to you.
Stay, Spider.
Mr. Jerome?
Go away!
I'm not going to hurt you.
You killed Victoria Hardy.
Get away from me!
Go!
Go! Go!
- What the hell is going on?
- Complete nonsense.
Let's get you to the house.
You should have left.
You should have gone when we told you to.
John.
His little girl is dead.
You saw her.
You saw that woman at the house.
For God's sake, take him home.
This isn't helping him.
All your superstitious rubbish.
You think this is superstitious rubbish that took your boy?
All right.
I'll take him to the station.
Pay no attention to them.
They're still living in the Dark Ages.
But I did see someone at the house.
Trust me, Arthur. It's just an old place cut off from the world.
The sooner the house is sorted out and sold, the sooner people can move on. Here.
This'll keep you going.
The late tide is due at 11:00.
I'll come back for you then.
It's fine.
I'd rather just work through the night.
Well, take the dog.
Come on, girl.
Just for company.
Don't go chasing shadows, Arthur.
Dear Alice,
you leave me no option but to give up my son.
If you have your doctors
deem me mentally unfit to raise my child, what can I do?
You and Charles can take him from me, but he is mine,
mine, he can never be yours.
Jennet.
Dear Alice,
I find it hard to express the depth of betrayal from you, my own sister,
at your refusal to let me visit my son
or even give him my birthday cards.
I begin to believe you're not doing this for the good of the boy,
but to cause me pain.
He is mine.
If you won't let me see him, I will find a way.
You didn't try to save him.
You just saved yourself.
You didn't even give him a proper burial.
You just left him there in the mud.
His blood is on your hands.
I will never forgive you.
Rot in hell.
He will never be yours.
Who's there?
You don't believe me, do you?
I believe even the most rational mind can play tricks in the dark.
I saw them, Sam. I saw her and her boy.
No. The boy was lost to the marsh.
His body was never recovered.
I saw them.
Oh, my God!
No, don't...
Lucy!
Lucy!
Arthur!
- No! No!
- Arthur!
Arthur!
Stay there. I'm going to come and get you.
No!
Arthur?
Here.
I remember when the Jeromes lost their first child.
They decided to have another. Lucy.
They locked her up to protect her.
- Not that you can ever replace...
- She was there, Sam.
You're tired.
Get some rest.
What happened to him, Mrs. Daily?
He was playing at the beach with his friends and they said the tide must have caught them off guard.
You've seen her, haven't you?
She was there this morning in the fire.
She's always there.
You mustn't blame yourself.
- Blame myself for what?
- For not listening to the others.
For not staying away from the house.
What? I don't understand.
Whenever she's been seen, on the causeway, on the marsh, in the grounds of the house, however briefly and whoever by, there has always been one sure and certain result.
Yes?
In some violent or dreadful circumstance, a child has died.
So many... So many children.
So many children.
The Fishers' daughters and Jeromes' eldest.
Keckwick's son, my Nicholas.
How?
Mrs. Daily?
Mrs. Daily?
She makes us... She makes us do it.
She makes us.
They took her boy away.
So now she takes us.
She saw you.
She saw you.
She's coming.
She's coming.
- Elizabeth!
- Sam!
- Sam!
- Elizabeth!
No, Elizabeth. No! No!
Elizabeth.
Joseph.
If we can get the telegram off now, we can catch them before they get on the train.
How could you take me to Eel Marsh?
If even a small part of you feared the stories were true?
- But I never believed them.
- No, you didn't want to.
- There's a difference.
- I had no choice, Arthur.
Either Nicholas is in a better place waiting for us to be reunited one day, or he's lost.
Now which would you have chosen to believe?
Forgive me, Sam, but my son is alive.
He's on his way here.
No.
The next village is over an hour away.
They'll have left by then.
What time is the tide back out?
5:00. Why?
If we can reunite Jennet Humf rye with her son, perhaps she'll finally be at peace.
They never recovered the child's body, Arthur.
But you have something they never had.
Arthur?
Sam, I feel it. It's just beneath my feet.
Just give me a moment while I tie it.
Be careful.
Arthur?
Oh, my God.
Keep driving.
Don't stop!
The pedal's on the floor.
I've found the boy.
Can you go any farther?
The engine's overheating!
Come on.
Sam, please, it's sinking.
Hurry!
Here, here.
Let's just put him in the ground, Arthur.
Let's get it over with.
Sam, there's something I need to do first.
They're lost.
They need to find each other.
Nearly time now.
Come on.
Nicholas?
Daddy?
Arthur!
Arthur.
I think she's gone.
Thank you.
I will never forgive you for letting my boy die.
I will never forgive.
Never forgive.
Never forgive. Never forgive.
Never forgive. Never forgive.
One step, two step. Good boy.
- Joseph!
- Daddy!
Joseph, this is my friend, Sam.
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Joseph.
It's very nice to meet you.
Change of plans.
We're not staying here tonight.
We're going straight back to London.
Can you fetch us some tickets?
I'll explain on the way.
You're sure you don't want to rest up before you go?
Yes, I just want to get him home.
I understand.
Three tickets back to London, please.
- Will you and Elizabeth be all right?
- We will.
Then you must come down to London and visit us.
Elizabeth would love that.
Sam?
Daddy? Who's that lady?
That's your Mummy.
Shh! Shh!
We caught the bitch.
Please don't hurt me.
Don't be afraid, girl.
Who are you?
Somebody please help me.
Only the evil book can undo what the evil book has done.
Please.
I just want to go home.
Please.
I just want to go home.
Daddy?
Daddy, why are you doing this to me?
Who are these people?
Look, they are good people.
They are here to help.
What are you talking about?
Where's Mom?
Mommy is dead, baby.
You know that.
You killed her.
What?
You did.
No, why are you saying these things?
Please, I just want go home.
I just want to go home.
Do it! It's the only way to save her soul!
I'm so sorry, baby.
Daddy, what is that?
Daddy.
Daddy, look at me.
It's me.
Do it!
Give your daughter peace!
I just want you to hold me and take me home.
Please.
Please stop.
I will rip your soul out, Daddy.
I'll rip your soul out, you pathetic fuck!
Motherfucker!
I Will kill you like I killed... your whore!
Fuck!
Fuck!
I love you, baby.
Hey.
How's it going,
Mr. Hot Shit City Boy?
Hey, Olivia.
Come here.
Two arms, please.
Like you missed me.
Mmm.
This is my girl Natalie.
Oh, the heartbreaker from your car shop.
The doctor?
Actually, she's...
I'm a registered nurse.
Nurse.
Mmm-hmm.
Right, sorry.
You were supposed to be here two hours ago, man.
And that's our irresistibly charming Eric.
Teaching high school finally turned you into a bitter old coot, huh?
No, you did.
You kept us waiting here all morning.
Good to see you too, man.
Come here.
You look good.
She's waiting for you in the back.
Great.
Hey, Mia.
I'll be damned.
You actually came.
Come on, I'm your big brother.
Of course I came.
I know I look like road kill.
Oh, you look beautiful, as always.
And you're a charming liar, as always.
Grandpa?
Hey.
Hey, there buddy.
We always loved this place, didn't we?
He missed you a lot, you know.
Oh, my God.
What?
What is that?
What?
Just this, right here.
It's not funny!
This is made from a buckthorn tree.
It's supposed to make your will stronger.
I thought you didn't believe in that kind of stuff.
I don't. But you do, so, maybe it'll work.
Okay.
Well, then, let's do this.
Promise me you'll stay with me until the end.
I'm not going anywhere.
Cross your heart.
Okay.
Hope to die.
Okay.
May my friends and family witness this act... an irrevocable promise to my commitment that...
Fuck it.
I promise not to touch this shit... ever again.
Okay.
Let's play cold turkey.
Hopefully, this still works.
Wait.
Looks like someone broke in.
Be careful.
What is that smell?
Some teenagers probably just broke in here to drink beer and bump uglies.
Exactly.
Mom would have hated seeing the cabin like this.
Okay.
Let's make this place livable.
Hey.
Are you okay?
Do you remember that lullaby Mom used to sing us?
It was something like...
"Baby, little baby, it's time to say goodbye."
"Baby, little baby..."
Mia, please,
I don't think you need sad memories in your head right now.
Mom is not a sad one.
You know what I mean.
You know what? Her final days at the hospital...
Mom sometimes thought I was you.
She even called me David for a whole day, once.
And I played along, because...
Mia, I wanted to be there.
Okay, I did.
But by the time Mom got bad...
I had just gotten the job at the garage in Chicago.
I don't know, I had a hard time finding the right moment to come back.
And then it was too late. So...
Maybe you were lucky, not to see her the way that I did.
It looks like she is doing okay.
David, there is something you need to know.
Okay.
We already tried this whole thing back in Flint last summer.
Mia made the same promises.
She took the same dramatic vow of sobriety before chucking her dope down the toilet.
She lasted eight hours and quit.
So, we don't want to give her that chance this time.
What do you mean?
David, when she breaks... and believe me, she will... we don't want to let her leave.
What do you mean? You want force her to stay here?
Mia?
This time the only way is the hard way, man.
She won't survive another OD.
What?
Mia OD'd?
She didn't just OD.
Legally, your sister died.
They had to defibrillate her.
Jesus.
We all need to be together on this.
Otherwise it won't work.
Good boy.
I came here to make things better with my sister, not worse.
If she asks me to take her home at some point
I'm going to have to do it.
I can't stand it!
Fuck!
I can't stand it!
What the fuck is that smell?
I know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I can't stand that fucking smell anymore.
Lie down, okay?
We're here for you.
I know, I know.
We're all here.
We're all here.
We're not going anywhere.
Withdrawal is kicking in hard.
This should help you get through the night.
I don't know what is wrong with you people... but there is something dead and it reeks.
But there is no smell.
You're just extra-sensitive right now.
I just can't stand that fucking smell anymore.
Wait.
Oh, is that blood?
Shit. Oh...
What's your medical diagnosis now?
It fucking stinks.
Shit. Careful.
These steps are old and rotten.
Yeah, like this whole freaking house.
I know.
Ugh!
It smells like burnt hair.
I think it's back there.
Oh!
Ugh!
Oh, my God!
Shit.
What is this?
I don't know.
Witchcraft?
Who would do this?
Shit, something burned here.
Look.
Shit, man.
What the fuck happened here?
Let's not go crazy over this. Okay?
I'll bury those dead cats out back later.
Yeah. The smell will be gone in no time.
Yeah, okay.
And what about the voodoo shit they did down there?
No, no, no. Voodoo is more about dolls and personal artifacts.
This is something different.
Eric, that's enough.
You shouldn't have touched anything from that basement.
"Naturom Demonto."
"Kunda."
"Astratta."
"Montosse."
"Canda."
Please, God, give me a break.
Mia.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, but I have to get out of here right now.
No, come on. The slumber party isn't over yet.
Yeah, we still haven't played
"Fuck, Marry, Kill," right?
Mia, please look...
I'm going insane here.
Olivia, I feel like
I'm losing my mind.
What is it?
I will go through with this, okay?
I just...
I can't do it here.
Mia... we have decided we're not going to take you back.
We can't lose you again.
You're going to have to stick it out this time.
David, drive me home.
Come on, David.
Mia, maybe they're right.
You were supposed to be here to support me, not them.
I'm here for you.
That's why I came.
Oh, my God.
I'm such an idiot.
To think for once in my life...
I could count on you.
Mia, we're just trying to help you.
Well, fuck you very much!
Eric, leave her alone.
Mia.
Mia!
Perfect.
Fuck this. Fuck, fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck!
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?
Mia!
- Mia!
- Mia!
Mia.
Mia!
Mia.
Mia!
Mia!
Mia!
Mia!
Shit.
Oh, my God.
Hey, how's she doing?
Um, she's talking about a woman in the woods.
How the forest attacked her.
I don't know. It's just crazy withdrawal talk.
Don't you think we should take her to a hospital?
I feel like we're in over our heads here.
Okay. I am giving her the exact same treatment she would get at a hospital.
If we leave now, all of this mess will have been for nothing.
Okay. What about the wounds on her arms?
I pulled some thorns out.
It looks like she might have run into a thorn bush out there.
She probably did it on purpose.
What?
David... from now on, she is going to do whatever it takes to get out of here.
Mia.
Listen, you have to get out of those clothes.
All right?
Take a shower.
David.
Please.
Please.
You have to get me... out of here.
Nobody said this was going to be easy.
No.
You don't understand.
There was something in the woods, David.
And I think it's in here with us now.
With me in the room?
Look. You know it's all in your head.
Just try to get it together.
You'll feel better tomorrow, okay?
You'll be glad we were such assholes.
Okay.
Eric, what are you doing?
Would you please just get rid of that thing?
You should be downstairs helping your friend clean up that mess.
I don't know who you're talking about.
Don't act like you don't care about him.
I know you do.
I think we can all agree he hasn't cared about us for the past freaking century.
Well, he's here now.
Yeah.
Truly amazing.
Ugh.
Grandpa?
Grandpa!
Grandpa?
Come here, boy.
Fuck.
Grandpa.
No, no, no.
Hey, boy. Come here.
What did you get into?
Fuck.
What happened?
Mia?
She's in the shower.
What happened? David?
Mia?
Mia, open the door.
Hey, Mia, open the door.
Open the door!
David, what are you doing?
David, stop and tell me what's going on.
Mia, open the fucking door!
Mia?
Mia, open the fucking door!
David!
David!
Stop it!
Mia!
Mia?
Mia?
Olivia!
Holy shit!
Mia!
Shit.
This is insane.
Fuck. Where is it?
This can't be happening.
I gave her a sedative so she should be out for a couple of hours.
But, fuck, her burns are serious.
Like, second, third degree.
This is so wrong.
Nobody could have known she would do something so twisted!
No, you should have known!
We've been following your lead since we got here.
We should have left when Mia wanted to.
Baby, please! Let's not lose our heads, okay?
With any luck, it will stop raining in a couple of hours... and we'll be able to cross the creek in the morning, and take her to a hospital.
Okay? Everything is going to be fine.
"Everything is going to be fine"?
Everything is going to be fine.
I don't know if you've noticed this, but nothing has been fine.
And everything has been getting worse every second.
Mia?
Mia?
What are you doing?
Mia, put the gun down.
Put the gun down, please.
Mia.
Put the fucking gun down!
Die!
One by one we will take you!
You are all going to die tonight.
The gun.
The gun, quick!
Baby?
Mia!
Let me out!
She's totally psychotic.
My God, what happened to her eyes?
What's she doing?
It sounds like she's hitting herself against something.
This is impossible.
I just gave her enough sedative to put a horse to sleep.
Give her another shot!
That could put her into a coma.
For Christ's sakes, she's going to kill herself down there!
Go get the shot!
I have to get the shrapnel out of my arm.
What? I have tweezers in my purse.
David. Listen to me.
I don't think a tranquilizer is going to do shit.
Because I don't think we're dealing with a freaking panic attack here!
I'm scared that what's happening to Mia has something to do... with the fucking witchcraft in the basement!
Ow!
Olivia!
Olivia?
Olivia?
Are you okay?
Olivia?
Olivia, what are you doing in there?
Olivia.
Olivia.
Are you okay?
Oh, my God!
Why the fuck did you do that?
Kill him.
No!
Ah!
She tried to kill me.
She tried to kill me.
Fuck.
You hold that.
You got it?
Hold it there, okay?
Hold it.
Fuck it.
David,
I did something terrible.
I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt her.
That thing I killed was not Olivia.
He's losing too much blood.
Baby, he needs water and sugar.
Okay?
Go.
Go!
Okay. Okay.
All right.
David.
I read a passage from that book.
It was some sort of prayer.
I released something, David.
I released something evil.
Natalie?
Mia?
Natalie.
What am I doing down here?
My leg hurts.
I can't move.
I'm going to come down there, okay?
Why did you lock me down here?
You were supposed to help me.
Hey, we're trying to help you, okay?
You were out of control, you know?
You got violent and we didn't know what else to do.
Mia, something really terrible has happened... and we have to get out of here now.
You don't understand.
He's not going to let you leave!
And he's not going to stop until he has you.
Until he has all of you!
I can smell your filthy soul.
Kiss me, you dirty cunt!
Why don't you come down here so I can suck your cock, pretty boy!
Mia.
Mia's not here, you fucking idiot!
Your little sister is being raped in hell!
Home. I want to go home.
Eric.
I don't know why, but I thought this would end it.
But this book does not burn.
It does not fucking burn.
Tell me what's going on here.
This book uses some... ancient alphabet.
There's some translations, but...
Just scattered notes.
They all refer to some... evil entity.
A taker of souls.
A demon.
It says...
"Once he feasts on five souls..."
"the sky will bleed again and the abomination..."
"will rise from Hell."
This is insane.
This thing is attached to
Mia's soul like a leech... it's becoming her.
If we want to stop this, if we want to help Mia...
I think we're going to have to kill her.
What did you say?
Everything says...
Eric! We're not going to fucking kill anybody!
Are you listening to yourself?
What about those dead cats down in the basement?
I mean, maybe they had some disease.
Some virus that spread to Mia... and then she passed it to Olivia when she puked all over her face!
But what kind of a virus makes a person cut off their face with a piece of glass?
Oh, God.
I don't know what we're dealing with here, okay?
But it stopped raining, and in a couple of hours the river will be clear... and we're going to get out of this place.
All of us.
It doesn't matter where we go.
If we don't do something right now... we are all going to be dead by then!
Don't do it, you little bitch!
Don't cut it off!
Don't cut it off!
Fuck you!
No, no, no!
No!
I had to do it.
And I feel much better now.
Hold on, baby.
Hold on, please.
Eric and I are going to put a stop to this, okay?
I promise that everything is going to be fine.
Okay? Okay, baby?
She just cut her fucking arm off.
Does that sound fine?
These inscriptions are confusing, sometimes contradictory... but they are consistent about one thing.
In order to stop this, the possessed must be cleansed.
Purified.
The book describes three specific ways.
A live burial.
Bodily dismemberment.
Dismemberment.
And purification by fire.
Are you sure this will work?
If we...
If I kill my sister, she will be at peace?
Am I sure?
Of course not.
This is not a science book!
But look,
I'm sure of one thing.
Whatever is inside Mia is the cause of all this.
If she dies, then this thing is going to die with her.
What if she just lost her mind?
What if she just needs a doctor?
What? A doctor?
My mom died in a mental hospital.
She was crazy.
She was deranged, she was a monster.
I've always feared that me and Mia would end up like her.
You are just a fucking coward.
You know exactly what we have to do... but you're too scared to go through with it.
I'm going to burn this fucking place down.
And I'm going to end this nightmare.
Why don't you just run away?
Go hide beneath some rock somewhere.
You know you're great at that.
Oh, shit.
Where the fuck did she go?
David.
Take it before she does.
No!
Stop!
No, no, no!
David.
Why are you hurting me?
My face hurts.
Why?
Why...
Why does my face hurt?
Baby.
Nat.
Come on, man.
Here we are.
Hey. Hold on.
Don't die on me, please!
Dying wouldn't be so bad right now.
I just don't want to become the devil's bitch.
I'm going to do what I got to do.
I'm going to do what I got to do. Okay?
I'm sorry, Mia.
I love you.
♪ Baby, little baby
♪ It's time to say goodbye
♪ Baby, little baby
♪ I'll miss you day and night
♪ Baby, my sweet baby
♪ I'll write you every day
♪ Baby, don't cry, baby
♪ I wish that I could stay ♪
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
This time the only fucking way is the hard way!
David.
Murderer.
Coward.
Eric.
Hey. Okay?
David.
I missed you, man.
You know that, buddy.
David?
David?
I can't move!
I can't breathe!
David!
Help me!
Help me, David!
You're not her.
David!
Help me!
You're not her!
Why do you hate me, David?
I know you do.
You left home.
You left me all alone with our sick mother.
And I was just a kid.
You made me lie.
Every time she screamed your name,
I told her you were coming to see her.
Like you promised.
But you never did.
Please stop it,
I'm begging you.
I know Mother hates you now, and she waits for you in hell.
Shut up. Shut up.
I'm so sorry.
I should have been there.
I should have been there for you.
Come on.
Please, come back.
Come on, Mia.
Come back to me, please!
Okay, you are at peace.
You are at peace now.
David?
Mia?
It was so horrible.
It was so horrible.
It's okay.
It's all over now.
Thanks for not leaving me, David.
Wait here. I'm going to get the car keys.
Okay?
Yeah.
David!
Go. Please, go.
Go!
I'm not going to go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere!
Here, take the keys.
Look at me, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.
Get out of here.
No! No!
David!
David!
No! No!
David! David!
He's coming.
Mia.
Come here, you bitch!
Come on.
You're going to die here, you pathetic junkie!
I've had enough of this shit.
I will feast on your soul.
Feast on this, motherfucker!
Die!
Go back to Hell, bitch.
I believe I have made a significant find
in the Candarian Ruins...
a volume of ancient
Sumerian burial practices
and funerary incantations.
It is entitled
"Naturom Demonto."
Roughly translated,
"Book of the Dead."
The book is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood.
It deals with demons, demon resurrection...
those forces which roam the forest
and dark bowers of man's domain.
The first few pages warn that these enduring creatures...
may lie dormant but are never truly dead.
They may be recalled to active life
through the incantations presented in this book.
It is through recitation of these passages
that the demons are given license...
to possess the living.
I have seen the dark shadows moving in the woods...
and I have no doubt that whatever I have resurrected
through this book...
is sure to come calling for me.
Groovy.
- Understand. l'll call them tomorrow, arrange something for next weekend.
- lt was pretty short notice.
- Yeah, l think she was just calling on the off chance we hadn't made plans.
- l'll sort the food out if you want to get changed.
- Cool.
- ln the kitchen. lt's all ready.
Had been burgled, we wouldn't need to check the webcam to find out.
There probably wouldn't be a laptop to check.
- Well, that doesn't matter now,
'cause l signed up to a website that stores the recordings.
The camera uploads whatever it sees when it's triggered.
- Well, l'm not sure if l like that idea.
- lt's a secure site.
No one else can see it, and l can check it if we're away or when l'm at work.
- So you've already checked it today, then?
- This guy in Nottingham, yeah, he sets his camera up like ours.
He gets home from work, and he checks it.
He hasn't been burgled.
Well, at least nothing had been taken, but the camera's been triggered.
When he watches the video back, he sees that he has filmed a guy in his house.
Turns out that this guy has been breaking in every day when he's at work, wearing his clothes, even sleeping in his bed. lmagine coming home to that.
- Mm, it'd explain where all the milk goes.
So?
- Nothing.
- See?
Told you there wouldn't be anything on it.
All done?
- Yep.
- Good.
Let's eat.
- Thank you.
Shit.
- We missed the end.
- Mm, don't open it.
Don't open it.
Don't open it.
- What?
- What?
- l thought you were awake.
Ah, shit, what happened?
- You were talking in your sleep.
- What?
What did l say?
- ''Don't open it.
Don't open it.''
- Don't open it?
Don't open what?
What time is it?
- After 1 2:00.
- lt's a bit late to--- l'll go.
- No, no, no. l'll go.
Shit.
Fuck, David.
- Sorry.
- You scared me.
- Can l come in?
- Of course.
- Just didn't know where else to go.
- What's wrong?
- lt's Sarah.
- What?
- She's been seeing someone else.
- Oh.
- Can we go inside?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Hey, Kate.
Sorry, l didn't mean to barge in like this.
- No, no, don't be silly.
Do you want a drink or something? l think we've got some more wine.
- l'm gonna head off to bed, leave you two to talk, okay?
- Okay, l won't be long.
- Okay, wake me up when you come to bed.
- Okay, l don't think David will want to go home tonight.
- Well, there's plenty of clean sheets in the airing cupboard.
- Okay.
Night, you.
- Night.
- lt was up on St. Catherine's Hill, where--- l don't know who it was, but he had one of those boxes of fireworks, you know, the, the rockets in the cube, and they chucked it on the bonfire.
- That was Nigel.
- Was it?
Fucking knob. lt was like fucking Vietnam or something.
Do you know what l mean?
There was rockets flying around, fire in the trees, man.
- Yeah, and what were you doing, you maniac?
You just stood there, watching it, Mr. No Fear.
- That was the booze.
- Polish courage.
- That stuff is evil.
- l was about to have a shower when, um--- what time is it?
- Just after 3:00.
- You want to know what happened?
- Only if you want to tell me.
Sarah's away for the night on business for the bank.
At least l think that's---
- l'm sure that's where she is, mate.
- Got home tonight, and there's a message on the answer machine. lt was from Helen, a friend of Sarah's.
She said---she said she needs the number of someone at work.
Sounded pretty urgent, you know, so l--- l tried to call Sarah on the mobile.
When l got through to her, l could hear the phone ringing, you know, actually ringing in the house, in the bedroom.
- You don't have to tell me.
- So l went upstairs, and, uh...
She'd left her bag on the bed.
She's got an address book in there somewhere, l knew it. l never looked in her bag before.
There was photographs of her.
- l'm sorry, mate.
- He wasn't in any of the pictures, you know?
Just Sarah, undressed.
What the fuck are you supposed to do when something like that happens, huh?
Started trying to figure out who he was.
Thing is, we don't know that many people. l just---l know l know him.
Then you start thinking,
''How many times have l been sat next to him at a dinner, bought him a drink in the pub?''
- No, you can't think like that.
- l can't get it out of my fuckin' head.
What am l gonna do?
What the fuck am l gonna do now?
 - David, happy birthday. 
 - Thank you.
- You old bastard. 
 - Watch this.
 - So disappointing. 
 How much you pay for them? 
 - That's rubbish.
 Okay, this is a tour of his new pad, 
 brought to you in association with the letter S, 
 for, ''Shit, this is nice!'' 
 Okay, this is the lounge. 
 So this is the lounge.
Very nice. 
 - This is my lounge. 
 - That's beautiful. 
 And all your cards, you popular man. 
 - Yeah, thank you. 
 - What, you just dive in, really? 
 l don't know.
- Oh, do it. 
 - What do you think l should do? 
 Spend some time in here. 
 Ah, here she is. 
 This is the lady. 
 Aw, beautif--- 
No, not here.
Not here, please.
Oh, God, oh.
Fuck.
Come on.
Fuck it.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
- Hello?
What am l doing? l'm talking to myself like a nut.
Oh, hi.
Sorry, did l wake you?
- No, l wasn't sleeping.
- Okay.
- What time is it?
- Um, it is a little after 8:00. l'm from upstairs?
Oh, you're not gonna believe this. l came down here, and now l can't remember what it was that l wanted.
God, you know, ever since this, this has just turned to mush. l'd been meaning to pop by and say hello anyway, but l'm sure there was something else.
No, l can't remember.
- l don't actually live here.
The people that do, um,
Alex and Kate, they're not up yet.
- Oh, well, l can pop by later.
Maybe l might have remembered by then what it was that I came down to say, in the first place.
Oh. l'm Anna.
- David.
- lt's nice to meet you.
- You too.
- Was someone at the door?
- Uh, yeah.
Anna, from upstairs.
- Upstairs?
Hope that means they've finished renovating now.
What did she want?
- She didn't know.
Did you hear anything last night?
- Dead to the world, mate.
Why?
We get a lot of foxes round here.
They make a hell of a noise some nights.
Are you okay?
- Yeah, mate.
Just tired, you know?
- l'm going to grab a shower and then get a paper.
Kate won't be up for a while yet, if you want to get some more sleep.
- No, thanks, mate, l'm fine.
- All right.
How's David this morning?
- Not good.
- l'm not surprised.
How long had they been together?
- Oh, must be three, three and a bit years.
Yeah, it was New Year's Eve.
- When you came to bed last night, did you say David found out about the affair from some photographs?
- Yeah.
- Doesn't that seem odd to you?
- What do you mean?
- Don't know. l just--- l guess Sarah never struck me as the type who'd do that kind of thing, you know?
Pictures and so on.
What do you think?
- l think it's a fucking mess.
 - Hi, we're not able to get to the phone right now, 
 but please leave a message. 
- Oh, freezing out there.
Bed and breakfast.
Don't say l'm not a good host.
- Thanks.
- Right.
Let's do it.
Don't mind, do you, mate?
- No, carry on.
- This won't take long.
- Uh-huh.
We'll see.
- Right.
- That's just brutal.
That's really brutal.
Whoa.
- lt's okay, lt's okay.
Didn't mean to make you jump. l didn't know if you were asleep or not.
Do you want a blanket or something?
- No, l'm fine. Thank you. l'm just gonna--- l'm just gonna stretch my legs, wake myself up a bit.
- Fancy a kicking?
- No, maybe in a bit.
You got any painkillers?
- Yeah, in my bag in the back room.
Have you got a headache?
Revenge.
- Right.
That's one, then.
Dying.
Don't think so.
- ls everything all right?
Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
- What kind of a person would you say l was?
You've known me for a long time, right?
- Yeah, why?
What do you mean?
Did Sarah say something?
- No, just---
How would you describe me?
- l don't know. lntelligent. l'm not very good at this sort of thing.
Popular, level-headed.
Ah. Shit.
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, it's not deep.
Are you okay?
- Can l stay here again tonight?
- Of course you can.
Tell you what.
There's a flyer on the fridge. l've been dying to try this out.
There's a company that deliver everything: beer, cigarettes, movies, games.
We'll have a complete blow-out. l think we deserve it, don't you?
- Yeah.
Shit.
- What?
What is it?
- David.
You scared the hell out of me.
- David.
What is it?
David.
David.
- Alex, shh. l think he's sleepwalking.
- What, really?
- Joe used to do it all the time when we were kids.
- David?
He looks so scared.
- He could be having a nightmare.
- What do you think he's looking at?
- ln his dream?
Whatever it is, it's moving.
- l'm going to wake him up.
- No, don't.
- Look, he's terrified. l've got to do something.
What did you used to do with Joe?
- We could try moving him, try putting him back to bed.
- David. lt's okay. lt's just a dream.
You're asleep.
- David, David.
Wake up, mate.
David, wake up. Wake up.
- Wake up, mate.
Wake up.
Wake up. lt's okay. lt's okay.
You're just sleepwalking.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
That was--- that was pretty mad. l didn't know you sleepwalked.
We're dry on everything else, so l'm afraid it'll have to be coffee.
- What?
What happened?
- What do you mean? lt's okay, it's okay.
You were just sleepwalking. lt wasn't real.
- Sleepwalking?
No, you don't understand.
You can't see them coming if you're asleep.
- What?
David.
David.
What is it, mate?
David, what's happening?
- Oh, Christ.
Oh, Christ. l think l--- l think l'm going out of my fucking mind.
- No, no, you're not.
You're not.
- lt started a couple of weeks ago, a couple of days after you and Kate came over. l thought l was just tired.
- What started?
- l've thought about it a lot since then.
Maybe they've always been there.
- Who?
Who have?
- All day, l had this feeling, you know, a sense of something, something l couldn't see, like intuition, like someone was watching me, like something bad was gonna happen. l was in the office. l wasn't doing anything different.
You know when you see something out of the corner of your eye, and you turn to look, and there's nothing there?
- Yeah.
- That's what it was like. lt kept happening. l just thought l was tired.
You know, it was quite a fuckin' weekend, running Sarah's birthday and everything, so l--- l left the office, and l went home.
- Go on.
- l felt better there. l left Sarah watching TV downstairs, and l--- l went to bed.
And l slept. l slept heavily for a while.
Then l woke up. l thought l could hear Sarah moving around downstairs.
But it was later than l thought.
And Sarah was asleep in the bed, next to me. l lay there listening for hours,
'cause l knew. l knew even then, and l didn't want to--- l didn't want to leave the room. l didn't want to be on my own. l didn't want to be away from Sarah.
Eventually, the sun came up, and l, uh--- l hoped that would be an end of it.
You think to yourself,
''Were those noises there before; l just didn't notice them?
Were the shadows as thick as that?'' when you turn off the light, and you're swallowed into that darkness. l should have told Sarah. lt didn't stop. lt hasn't stopped.
Second day wasn't as bad, actually. l think they did that on purpose just to give me false hope.
- Who did?
- You don't believe in God, do you?
- No. l've thought about it, but it doesn't make any sense to me.
- No, me neither, but the last couple of weeks, l've started to change my mind...
Because...
Because if there are monsters and devils, couldn't there be a God? l mean, shouldn't there be?
- l don't understand.
- l've prayed. l've fuckin' prayed.
No one's listening. lmagine it, yeah?
They're real, and God isn't.
There's a hell and nothing else.
They're coming for me, coming for me, and l don't know why.
And what have l done?
What have l done? l've hardly slept this past week. l'm sorry.
You don't close your eyes.
You can't let your guard down. l'm sorry. l didn't want to fall asleep. l'm just so fuckin' tired.
- lt's okay.
- No, it's not. l didn't mean to get you and Kate involved in this. l really didn't. lt's just that everything that happened... lt's just that everything that happened with Sarah, l didn't know where to go.
And l didn't want to be on my own.
They're out there.
They're waiting.
Last night, now. l've seen them.
- When you were sleepwalking, it was like you were watching something.
- Kate?
- They're in the house.
They're in the house.
- Alex, what's going on?
- l think it's a power cut.
Either that, or the trip switch.
You okay?
They're in the fuckin' house.
- l'm all right.
- lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay.
- We can't see them.
We can't see them, but they can see us.
Don't you understand?
We got to get into the light.
That's why they've done this.
We're sitting ducks here.
- Your lighter.
Have you got your lighter?
- lt's in the lounge with my cigarettes.
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Alex.
- lt's okay, it's me. l can't see anything.
- Christ, man.
We got to do something.
- The curtains.
David, open the curtains.
The light from outside--- we'll be able to see better.
- Alex?
- Alex, man, what are you doing?
We've got to get out.
- l'm looking for a light. l put them in here when l quit smoking.
- What's going on?
- What?
What?
- There's something in here with us. l've seen it.
- Kate, get out of the flat.
- Get out.
- Kate, get out.
Open the door.
- What is it?
What's going on, Alex?
- We can't stay here.
- Christ, be careful with that.
- Sorry.
- Alex, what's going on?
- The light won't protect us long.
We need to find somewhere to hide.
- Okay, okay, we've got to get out of here.
- Where are the keys?
- ln the flat.
- They're in the house.
- Who are?
- David's been seeing things.
- Things?
What are you talking about?
- Like ghosts or monsters.
- Monsters?
- This door isn't shut. l thought it shut behind---
Oh, shit.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- You shouted, Alex.
Did you see something in the flat?
- l don't know. l don't know, really. l don't know--- it was dark. l thought----
- You thought what?
- l don't know. lt looked like---
- Looked like what?
- We've got to get out of here. l can't hold it.
- Run.
Run.
- Go, go.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Go.
We have to do something.
- What's going on, Alex?
What the fuck's going on? ln the kitchen, what did you see?
- l don't know. l don't know.
- David?
David, it's Anna.
- Oh, God.
- David, what's going on?
- They're in the house. l'm sorry.
- Who is?
David?
David, switch the light back on. l can't---
Sorry, l just, um--- l really don't like the dark.
- ls there another room we can hide in?
- David, bring the light over here.
Did you hear that?
- David, the light.
David?
- David, the light. l can't hold it.
Just push.
- Push it. Push it. Push it.
Get in there.
Go.
- Okay. Okay. lt's okay.
You okay?
- No.
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.
- Okay, okay. l'm almost---
- Okay, okay.
- Fuck.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Kate.
- Shit.
Oh, shit. l'm coming.
- Alex, are you okay?
Oh, God.
Alex, what's going on?
- Hold this.
Hold it.
- Okay, l'm gonna go find the light, all right?
And push again.
- Hurry.
Hurry, please.
- Okay, okay.
- What is it?
- l don't know.
Something wet.
Fuck.
Oh, God.
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.
No, no, no.
- David?
- No.
- David, what is it?
David?
- lt's you.
- What?
What's going on?
David, what is it?
David.
No. l knew that something wasn't right. l always had a good memory.
Oh, David, my baby.
Oh, David. l'm so sorry. l remembered what it was l came down to say. l came to tell you to run.
Run.
- What?
Alex, what is it?
- l don't know.
David.
- David, are you okay?
David, is there anybody else in here with you?
- Kate, come here.
- Alex, what are we going to do?
Alex.
- Close the door.
We'll barricade ourselves in, wait until morning.
- What?
- Well, do you want to go back down to the flat?
- Fuck.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Fuck. l told you to wait on the landing.
- l know. l just thought you were taking too long.
Well?
- Nothing.
- Good.
- The power's still off. l'll head to the cellar and check the trip switch.
You okay? lt's all clear, mate.
David.
- l should go.
- No.
No, don't be silly.
Come on.
Come on.
Did you ask him about them?
- No.
Tell me what you saw.
Describe it to me.
- l don't know. l thought---
- Thought what?
Was it a person?
Was it something from that book?
- No.
No, l mean, it couldn't have been. l don't know what l saw.
- Do you think you could have been mistaken? lt was dark.
David had just been telling you what he's been seeing.
Do you believe him, Alex?
- Yes.
- You believe that these things are real?
- l don't know. l don't know.
- l... l don't want David to stay here again tonight.
- What?
- Last night, he was running around our house with a knife.
Okay. l know you two have been friends for a long time.
- Yeah, since college, nearly ten years.
This isn't like him, Kate.
This isn't like him at all.
You know that.
- Yes.
Yes, l do.
But that's why l don't want him to stay here again tonight.
You saw the state that he was in this morning.
How can this have happened,
Kate?
We only saw David two weeks ago.
There was nothing wrong with him then, was there?
- There didn't seem to be.
- And now this? lt doesn't make any fucking sense.
What could've done this to him in such a short space of time?
- He needs help, Alex, help that we can't give him.
Please, no more.
Please.
What the fuck?
Oh, fuck.
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
What? l don't know what to say.
What do you want?
Why me?
Know what?
You're Anna.
Then who are you?
S.
A.
R.
No.
No. l've got to get out of here.
No, no.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, you fuck, come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
No, no.
No.
No.
Please.
Please stop.
Please stop.
- David.
David, David.
What happened?
Kate.
David, what?
- They've killed her.
- What are you talking about?
- Sarah.
They've killed Sarah.
- l don't understand.
- What's going on?
- Kate, call Sarah.
- lt's dead.
- What?
- Nothing.
- She should be back by now, shouldn't she? l thought she was only away for Friday night.
- Come on.
Come on.
 - Hello, we're not around 
 to take your call at the moment, 
 but if you'd like to leave a message, 
 we'll call you back. 
- Hi, Sarah. lt's Alex.
Um, can you give us a call when you get this message? lt doesn't matter what time it is.
Thanks, bye.
- l'll try her mobile.
- Shit.
- What?
- The webcam's been recording all weekend. l must have set it up wrong. lt's filled up the whole hard drive.
- Nothing.
- This can't be right.
There must be something wrong with it.
- What?
- Well, all these recordings are from last night.
See, look how many times it was triggered.
- When last night?
- What time did David wake us up?
- l don't know.
We went to bed at about 1 :00.
- Well, it's not meant to record at night.
There's no infrared or night vision.
- Shit.
What the hell was that?
- lt's okay. lt's okay.
That's the first recording.
That's David sleepwalking.
- That doesn't make sense.
Something must have triggered it.
- What do you mean?
- lf that was David on the tape, then what set it off in the first place? lf it's triggered by movement, shouldn't the first thing that it captures be whatever set it running?
- Okay, hang on.
- Pause it at the beginning. lt's too dark. l can't see anything.
- Shit.
What the hell did this?
- lt's getting late.
They'll be looking for a way in, like last night.
- Look at all these recordings.
There's no pattern to them. lt's not as if there's a problem with the program setting the camera off every five minutes or so.
- Yeah, well, it has to be.
There's nothing else it could be.
- lsn't there?
- They're gonna kill us, aren't they?
Aren't they?
- l'm gonna go round to the house, check Sarah's okay.
You keep trying her from here.
- No, Alex. No, Alex.
- Christ.
What the hell was that?
- What?
- Shh.
- Oh, God.
- l heard something outside, in the corridor. l can't hear anything now.
Can you?
- No.
- Alex.
Please.
Please don't go out there.
- Did you hear something?
- No.
But they are out there.
- Alex.
No, wait.
We can keep trying Sarah from here. l don't think you should go.
Not yet.
- Shit.
Did you see that?
- What?
- The light. l thought it flashed.
- What are we going to do?
- What if he's right, Kate?
- He can't be.
This is insane.
- l've been thinking about it all day.
Maybe l was wrong about what l saw in the kitchen, but what about the apartment door?
Something was trying to get out of the flat.
- l don't know.
Couldn't he have done that?
- Kate, we've been through this.
Why did they break in?
They didn't take anything.
- Maybe we scared them off. l don't know.
- Well, how did they get out?
This morning, the front door was double-locked.
The back door was bolted. l've been through the whole house.
There was no way out.
- Alex.
- What?
What is it?
- They're in the house.
- What are you talking about?
Where?
- ln there. l saw something.
Must have been in there with me the whole time.
- What's going on?
- Shh.
- What happened?
- l came out the bathroom, and l locked the door. l turned the light switch off, and then l saw it.
Christ, Alex, how did they get in again?
We've got to do something.
- Turn the light off again.
What?
What happened?
- They've been here with us the whole time.
- Alex...
- We've got to turn the lights off.
- Please.
- We're gonna be okay.
- Kate, are you okay?
- Yeah.
- David?
- l'm here.
Shh.
- Can you see anything?
Run.
Run.
They're closing in.
- What was it, David?
What's there?
Kate, did you see anything?
- No, no, l---
Alex, what's going on?
- We've got to get out of here.
- No, we've got to turn these lights off.
- No way, no way.
You've seen these things during the day, haven't you?
Hasn't just been at night, has it?
- No.
- So why can't you see them with the lights on?
Why can't you see them now?
- l don't know. l just can't, okay? lt's been like this from the beginning.
They do what they want.
So turn off the light.
They killed Sarah, for fuck's sake.
Now they're gonna kill us.
So turn off the light.
Turn it off. l cannot see if they're in here.
Turn it off.
- Alex.
- David?
- l can't see any---
- Kate, turn the light back on.
- No. Wait.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh, shh.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- What?
David.
- lt's calling for more of them.
Turn it off again.
- No. l didn't hear anything.
- Turn off the light.
They'll be able to see we're in here.
Turn it off.
- Turn it off, Kate.
- Alex, stop this.
- Turn off the lights.
- What's going on?
- Shh.
- David?
- Shh.
Shh.
- What's going on, David?
- Alex, calm down.
Calm down.
- Shh.
- What's happening?
- They're all around us.
They're all around the house.
- We've got to get out of here.
- Where the fuck are we gonna go?
- Alex is right.
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out of here now.
- No, you'll let them in.
- They're already in.
We've got to get out.
- Alex.
Alex, no.
We've got to keep them out.
- No.
- Alex, no.
- Why didn't you listen to me?
We need to block this door.
We've got to stop them getting in.
- Kate, help me move him.
- Alex.
Alex, mate.
Alex.
Shit.
Alex.
Kate, we got to move him.
We got to block this door.
We can't let them in.
They're gonna kill us, man.
Like they killed Sarah.
Kate.
- David.
Please, help.
- l was just trying to protect you.
You can't go out there.
They will kill you, like Sarah.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Look, look, it's black. lt's a trick just to get me here.
There never was any affair.
Oh, God. l left her alone with them. l left her alone with them.
No.
- No, you'll let them in.
Alex.
Alex, Alex. lt's going to be okay.
Alex.
Alex.
Alex. l'll get help. l love you. lt's gonna be okay.
Okay.
''Don't open it.''

This isn't just any slumber party.
This is your first royal slumber party.
I know.
I'm very excited.
Oh, me too!
And I want everything to be perfect.
That goes in the banquet room!
Quick, quick!
It's on its way to the banquet room right now, m'lady.
Ah! Very good.
Thank you, baileywick!
( Sighs ) Here, let me straighten your tiara.
Thanks, Amber.
Oh.
Up we go.
Now, wait until you see where we're sleeping tonight.
Oh, and here we are!
The observatory!
Wow, Amber!
We're going to sleep here?
Yes, we are!
This is amazing!
It is, isn't it?
And there's one more thing:
The most important part of any great royal party...
Yes?
The guests.
I invited princess hildegard and princess clio.
They're the most popular princesses in school.
Who did you invite?
Ruby and jade.
Oh, I don't know them.
What kingdom are they from?
Ours. They're my friends from the village.
You invited village girls?
They're really awesome.
But they're not princesses.
Amber, I know you're going to love them.
We used to have the best sleepovers.
Sofia...
Must I remind you...
Again, that this is your first slumber party as a princess.
You do want to make a good impression, don't you?
Yes, but Ruby and jade are so much fun.
Wait 'til you see this dance they do.
They're going to make this the best party ever,
I promise.
Ow! Oh, what is it?
Cedric.
Oh, king Roland.
Queen Miranda.
The girls are having a slumber party tonight.
Oh, I can already hear the endless giggling now.
And we were hoping you could put on a little magic show for them.
You want your royal sorcerer to, uh, entertain the children?
We actually wanted the Jester, but he's out sick.
Let's say 8:00 in the royal playroom?
And could you do a few card tricks?
You know, children love card tricks.
Oh, and card tricks love children.
Of course, your majesty.
Great.
Thank you, Cedric.
Yes, my queen.
Oh, I can't believe this!
Fifteen years of sorcerer training, so I can be a warm-up act for milk and cookies!
Indeed, wormy.
Well, I'll show them.
I'll use this little magic show to steal the amulet of avalor from princess Sofia.
The only question is how.
Ah-ha! I'll have my little puppets put on the magic show!
And the one and only trick will be to make Sofia's amulet disappear right into my hand!
Puppetti venite!
I will finally have the power to take over the kingdom!
They're here!
May I present, from the kingdom of corinthia, princess clio!
And from the kingdom of freezenberg, princess hildegard!
Wow.
Mm-hmm.
Hildegard. Clio.
Amber. Sofia.
So nice of you to invite us.
And from the village of dunwiddie,
Ruby and jade!
Sofia!
Princess Amber!
Jade! Ruby!
Here I come.
I gotcha.
Both: Hi, Sofia!
Welcome to our castle!
I can't believe we're here.
This is going to be so much fun.
Oh my goodness, I'm so excited I couldn't even sleep last night.
I was thinking about being in a real life castle like, do princesses brush their own teeth or does someone brush them for you?
I brushed mine twice today, especially for the party.
See?
Wow, princess Amber!
I love your tiara!
Can I touch it!?
Absolutely not.
Princesses clio!
Princess hildegard!
It's such an honor.
I'm a big fan, big fan.
Oh, a white squirrel!
How cute!
Lulu is a mink.
I have a pet donkey!
Isn't he cute?
Welcome to the royal sleepover.

How would you two like a royal makeover?
Can we?
We can make it work.
First, the dresses.
Oh, thank you helpful bird friends.
Oh! So soft!
So silky!
Hooray!
And now, for the hair.
Let's do something stylish but regal.
And tall. Very tall.
Oh!
There.
And there.
Wait. Yes. Back.
Ah!
Ouch!
I've never had my hair done by a bird before.
Front. Down. Back.
No. Yes!
And last but not least, the tiaras.
Baileywick:
And... done.
I'm a princess now!
They look just like princesses, don't they?
They look the part.
But can they act it?
Ooh! ( Grunts )
Oh!
Oh! You okay?
Baileywick: Okay!
It's time for the first activity: Fan decorating!
Princesses one and all, follow me.
What kind of flowers are you painting, hildegard?
Roses.
What kind of flowers are you painting, clio?
Roses.
What kind of flowers are you painting, Amber?
Roses.
I'm Mr. happy fan.
Say "hi" to happy fan.
Sofia!
Ruby. Can you just paint roses?
Don't make me
Mr. sad fan!
Ruby.
Okay.
Baileywick!
Is it time for pin the tail on the unicorn yet?
It is now.
( Sighs ) Great.
Ooh! Ooh! Can I go first?
Unicorns are my favorite animal in the whole world!
No offense.
Which way should I go?
Ruby: Left.
Left?
No. Right.
Um, right? Uh?
Now left.
Left? Uh...
Wait! Not that far.
Wh-whoa! Aah! Oh! Oh!
Stop. Stop, jade, stop.
Ruby: Watch out for the planets.
Look at me!
I'm the princess of Venus!
Oh!
Did someone else want a turn?
Sofia, I need to talk to you.
( Gasps ) The bell!
That must mean it's time for a new activity.
Yes, indeed.
Cedric's magic show is about to start.
Right this way.
( Sighs ) A magic show!
Doesn't that sound like a fun activity that everyone
can enjoy together?
Ah! In just a few moments,
Sofia's magical amulet will be mine.
Right. Let's practice this one more time from the top.
Yeah? Okay.
For my first magic trick,
I will make an object disappear!
Now, who will loan me their amulet for this trick?
Oh, everyone's a critic.
Jade: Princess clio,
I heard it gets warm in your kingdom...
Do you really have swimming pools in every room of your castle?
Yes.
How many dresses do you have?
Princess hildegard, I've always wanted to know how many tiaras do you have?
Wow. 84?
How many gowns?
More than I can count.
I bet you can count really high!
Sofia, do something about your friends.
Ruby, uh, did you know there's a chocolate milk fountain?
Why don't we get some before the show starts?
A chocolate milk fountain?
Sofia, this is so much fun!
I'm having the best time.
Thanks for inviting us.
Sure.
Jade! Save me a seat, front and center!
All they have to do now is sit quietly and watch a magic show.
What could go wrong?
Welcome to the greatest and only magical puppet show in enchancia!
For my first magic trick,
I will make an object disappear.
Now who will lend me their amulet for my trick?
How about you, little princess?
How about a pinecone?
Can you make that disappear?
No! No pine...
No, I need an amulet.
Only an amulet!
Do you know any card tricks?
I love those!
James: Hey, everybody!
Mom and dad asked me to tell you that th...
Both: Prince James!
Remember us?
We met the last time we were at the castle.
No!
Ruby: You poured me tea!
Merlin's mushroom!
My nightgown...
Is ruined.
It's only a drop.
Look at it! It's ruined!
It's ruined.
We're so, so sorry.
Jade: So sorry.
This was my third favorite gown.
Amber, it was just an accident.
Oh no.
Oh dear, oh dear.
Okay you two.
Let's go to the dressing room and get you cleaned up.
What are you doing here, James?
Mom and dad wanted me to tell you there's dancing in the ballroom.
Then maybe we can enjoy five minutes of our party without Sofia's friends
getting in the way.
No. My friends are ruining the party.
That was the funniest thing that's ever happened at one of Amber's sleepovers.
Oh! It was awful!
Jade and Ruby have done everything wrong since they got here.
Says who?
Amber. Hildegard. Clio.
So? Who cares what they think.
Everyone!
Well, what do you think?
I don't know.
I just don't want them to ruin the rest of the party!
Where is everybody?
In the ballroom, but can I talk to you guys first?
Sure.
I love to talk!
Yeah. That's the thing.
I want you both to fit in with the princesses.
And you want to fit in with them too, right?
We look just like them now, don't we?
Yes. You do.
But now you have to act like them.
Both: Huh?
Princesses don't talk so much, or laugh so loud, or make so many messes.
We talk too much?
We laugh too loud?
We were just having fun.
But we're sorry, we didn't realize we were causing problems.
We'll try to act, uh, more like the other princesses.
Oh, great. Thank you!
Just act like them.
Hmm?
Hmm.
Do you know how to do that?
Uh... no.
Let's give it a try.
Are you having any fun?
Nope.
Um, Sofia?
We're gonna go home.
What? Why?
We're not having a good time.
But you're finally fitting in!
And the best news is you're not embarrassing me anymore!
We were embarrassing you?
Sofia, I'm sorry if we talk too much and laugh too loud for your fancy new friends.
But we like to talk and we like to laugh.
And if that's not okay with you now that you're a princess, then maybe we shouldn't be friends anymore!
Hmm!
Don't worry about them, Sofia.
You're with us now.
But I wanted to be with them.
Ruby? Jade?
Oh no.
Jade just asked me to summon her father.
Is everything all right?
I told jade and Ruby to act more like the princesses.
I was trying to help them fit in.
But I just made them feel bad.
It seems to me the only one who needs to act more like a princess...
Is you.
Me?
Being a real princess is all about how you treat people, Sofia.
And if someone is your friend, you should like them for who they are.
You shouldn't try to change them, no matter who else is around.
I really messed up.
( Sighs ) Now it's too late to do anything about it.
Well, it's never too late to start acting like a princess.
And saying you're sorry is a great place to start.
You know, they're probably still here.
Go on.
You better hurry.
Thanks, mom.
Ruby! Jade! Wait!
I'm sorry!
Please don't leave!
Hmm! I thought we were embarrassing you.
You're not embarrassing me.
You're perfect just like you are.
You're sweet and loyal and so much fun to be with.
We are pretty fun.
And, you're my best friends.
I'm sorry about the way
I acted tonight.
And I'm really, really hoping you'll give me a chance to make it up to you.
I don't know.
We can start over and have our own slumber party.
Like we used to.
What do you say?
Just the three of us?
Hurry! Hurry! I wanna see.
Hmm? Not bad.
Hmm. Something's missing.
Oh finally, it's just us princesses.
Now this
is a perfect slumber party.
You know, Sofia's friends
were kinda fun.
Jade: Pinecone princess is back!
Sofia: This is the best slumber party ever!
Jade: Ruby, that's a funny dance.
Oh! Who could that be at this late hour?
Um, Sofia?
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Hmm? Sure.
We, uh, we heard a lot of laughing, and, and noise and stuff down here and uh, I, we just wanted to make sure everything was...
All, all right.
Oh, we're fine.
In fact, we're having a great time.
Really?
How about you guys?
Oh, um, well, us?
Oh, oh, well, you know, we're, um, uh...
Pardon me?
Well, we're, we're having...
It's, it's kind of, um, well, it's different..
Amber, your party's no fun without Ruby and jade, is it?
Okay, yes, Sofia!
We're so bored without the three of you!
Is there room for a few more princesses at our party?
The more the merrier.
( Giggles ) Thank you.
And one, two, three and forward, back and chicken elbows.

but I'm afraid it raises more questions than it answers.
Oh, w... what kind of questions?
The birds were negative for avian flu.
But what we did determine is that the impact trajectories
indicate the birds were part of three different flocks
and not one, as we originally assumed.
I don't understand.
So what does that mean?
What it means is that three different migrations
coming from three different directions flew into your house, Mrs. Barrett.
It's as if something was drawing them to your home.

I'm ready to tell you my news.
I lost six hours today.
I mean, the last thing I remember,
I was in the middle of this walk-through.
The clients told Pete that they thought
I was having some kind of breakdown.
And I woke up in bed, and I had this.
Jesus, Lace.
Daniel, I've got to show you something.
So I started with the birds.
And the best they can understand it is that something is interfering with the Earth's geomagnetic field, and... and that's causing the birds to veer off course.
Some people say that it has something to do with the government, that they're testing some kind of super-secret weapons technology.
And other people...
...think it's something else, something...
...not from here.
What does that mean, "not from here"?
Not from... this planet.
- Lacy.
- I know this is so hard to believe.
- Just trust me. I've been research...
- No, it's more than hard to believe.
I mean... aliens?
That's...
That's insane. Right?
You know this is the reason we don't self-diagnose on the Internet.
Stop. Hear me out on this.
There are people who have reported experiencing the same things that we have been experiencing, in these communities where these other bird deaths have taken place.
This picture was drawn by a five-year-old in Chesapeake Bay in 2007, shortly before he vanished.
Vanished, Daniel.
His family claims he was taken by aliens and that they had been entering their home for weeks.
Sam drew this yesterday.
Yeah, well, maybe Sammy saw this drawing online and copied it.
And maybe he made
800 birds hit our house?
I found a guy in the city who claims to be an expert on this stuff.
- I think we gotta go talk to him. Yes.
- No. No, no, no, no.
Well, what other explanation do you have?
Just because I can't explain something, doesn't mean aliens are responsible.
Why can't you understand that some things defy normal explanations?
We're not those people who believe in crazy things!
Maybe those people aren't the crazy ones!
- Who are you? Who...
- Don't do this.
- Where is my wife?
- Don't do that!

Either of you heard a ringing in your ears that seems to be happening only inside your head?
<font color="#D900D9">(SOFTLY)</font> Yes
Have you experienced any unexplained illnesses, strange allergies or nosebleeds?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Have you witnessed any abnormal behavior by animals in your neighborhood?
Three different flocks of birds flew into our house the other day.
I would say that qualifies.
Have either of you experienced any blackouts, stretches of time that you can't account for?
And have you experienced a feeling that you might not be in control of your own body?
How do you know all this?
You are not alone in this.
Others have experienced what you're going through and have struggled the way you're struggling now.
Why are the Grays, or whatever they are, so interested in us?
What makes us so special?
Nothing.
There's nothing special about you.
I'm sorry.
You were hoping for a different answer.
But this is beyond our comprehension.
What answer would a lab rat understand from a scientist in a white coat putting electrodes in its brain, giving it cancer?
I've interviewed literally thousands of people who claim to have been visited by the Grays.
They come from all walks of life.
The only thing they have in common is that their lives have become a living hell because of it.
People think of aliens as these beings invading our planet in some great cataclysm, destroying monuments, stealing our natural resources.
But it's not like that at all.
The invasion... already happened.
No one knows exactly when, but...
...they're here.
They've been here.
The presence of the Grays is now a fact of life.
Like death and taxes.
Do you know what they want?
They seem to be...
...studying us, experimenting on us.
One thing we know for sure is, they use our fears against us.
It can start like a... a childish prank...
...a mess in the kitchen or things missing in the house.
And before you know it, you're walking through a full-blown nightmare.
You probably already have implants.
Implants?
That's how they control you.
Make you do things you can't remember, make you see things that aren't there.

Yeah, there she is.
This one didn't take as well.
Skin's pretty irritated, that happens sometimes.
It's a... it's a rash or a bite.
That's what they want you to think.
The Grays...
...hide what they do.
Disguise the implants as something perfectly normal.
Most people don't even know they have them.
Well, can we remove it?
No.
No. Believe me, I've tried.
Oh, my God.
Every time I think I'm getting it, it seems to burrow in deeper.
<font color="#D900D9">(PANTING)</font>
We'll move. Pack everything in the car and just drive away.
These beings almost certainly came millions of light-years to get here.
Do you really think moving to the next town or checking into a motel will stop them from finding you?
The events you've been experiencing, the disturbances in your home, the blackouts, the marks on your bodies...
...they are not the beginning of something, Daniel.
They are the end of something.
It's like a countdown.
The Grays will watch a family for a long time before they reveal themselves.
But once they do, it means they're getting ready to take someone.
What are you talking about?
This is important.
Which member of your family did the Grays first make contact with?
<font color="#808080">DANIEL:</font>
My youngest son, Sam.
<font color="#808080">POLLARD:</font>
Then Sam is in the most danger.
The Grays almost always abduct the first family member they showed an interest in.
So that's it?
- We just wait until they take our son?
- No.
You fight them with everything you've got.
Your only hope is to make it so difficult for them, that they simply move on to someone else.
Wait-wait-wait-wait, I'm sor...
That can work?
It has before, in some cases.
Yes. I've even heard of cases where someone who's been taken has eventually returned, but you can't count on it.
Everything the Grays do is intended to divide us from one another, to isolate the one they've chosen.
Your greatest defense against them is if your family is unified.
But you have to act quickly.
There isn't much time.
<font color="#D900D9">(EXHALING)</font>
Protect your family, Mr. Barrett.
We'll go to the police.
We'll show them the surveillance video.
And say what, "We think aliens have come into our house, implanted some probes we can't see"?
The police will think we're crazy, Lace.
- Hell, I think we're crazy.
- They have to believe us.
- It's the truth!
- You realize what will happen if we do that?
They won't just not believe us.
They'll take Jesse and Sam.
They'll say we're unfit to be parents.

No, baby, you can't.

Gab,
You know what makes the dog to use  his tongue?
You think the fact he licks his ass?
Exactly.
I talked to Tony the other night when you took your shower.
He told me a couple of things.
He said he loved the rose leaves.
He said that person did it as well as you.
Sorry,
Michelle, but you and the dog, you're not so different.
Except that, he licks himself.
You're yucky!
I brush my teeth.
As well.
You brush your dog's teeth?
Yes.
I can not stand.
I feel more that way.
It gets worse.
It throws me to the ear.
If I could you polish the molars!
Stop it!
It is swollen?
Yes, a little.
Tomorrow, I run with Willy.
By the way, how are you?
Do you think?
He tears a few teeth file and hit the ball with Richard Gere in Florida.
On the Cote d'Azur!
Highly retirement!
Is there anything there?
Perhaps an accident.
No, it looks like ...
Looks like customs.
Good evening.
Border police.
Stop the engine. Your passports.
Yes, sir.
Stay in the car!
My passport behind in my bag.
Behind in your bag?
Yes.
Pull gently, hands in plain view.
Long night?
"Adel Khalid Jalil."
Sit back and lay hands on the wheel.
You have nothing to declare?
No, nothing.
It's not laugh.
What do they say?
It is because of the lighthouse.
I'll explain.
True, the lighthouse is broken, but it struck a deer ...
I speak to the driver.
You are the driver?
Sure, anything to declare?
No, nothing.
We were at a wedding near Lennoxville.
We return to Portland and we have nothing to declare.
What are they doing?
- An identity check.
- No kidding!
Thank you!
You know you have a broken headlight?
Yes, in fact ...
We hit a deer.
You hit a deer?
Are you sure it was a doe?
It was either a doe ...
Be a roebuck!
I do not know the difference.
You do not know the difference?
You distinguish a male not a female?
For example, your friend is a doe or a roebuck?
Respond.
A doe.
And the wise guy behind?
A roebuck.
- And next to him?
- Listen ...
I think it was a doe.
Where have you struck?
I do not know ...
How so?
But you were driving.
It was on the road
I do not know the area well.
I see.
Give me your passport.
He starts to piss me off!
Calm down.
They are quite excited like that.
What was the animal?
He was dead.
He was dead before the incident?
He died later.
He died later.
Get off the vehicle.
All.
All behind the white line!
What does it mean?
Mere formality.
Do not worry.
Still nothing to report?
Currency?
Valuables?
So something else?
Hashish, cocaine, amphetamines ... ?
- Heroin?
- No.
And you, young man, anything to declare?
My brother is dumb.
It's original.
Do not make fun of him.
Pardon?
Do your homework, but do not laugh at him.
I do not care for him,
I try to communicate.
Sorry if I have injured you or your brother.
Tell him.
Pardon?
Tell him I'm sorry if I have hurt.
My brother is dumb not deaf.
I know, but I ask you to translate.
To be sure.
- Have you kidnapped someone?
- Pardon?
Answer!
No.
Do you plan to an attack in our country?
Do you have links with a terrorist group?
Are you kidding?
I do my work.
If you have nothing to hide, answer:
Are you related a terrorist group?
Not at all!

Did you go to Bali?
London?
Madrid?
No, never.

There is new or is a fake?
No, it's true.

Get carried away.
I do my work.
This is the procedure.
Stay calm, cooperate and you will leave.

Are you a worshiper of Allah?
That's enough!
I am a lawyer.

He wants his Ventolin.
- Do not move!
- I'll get her Ventolin!

And shit!
Well, well ...
What is it?
It seems that the situation is complicated.
That's a big blow!
I will not address that.
Who is marijuana?
It is a mistake, it is not our bag.
Who is marijuana?
To me.
We must choose, wise guy.
It is your or the kid?
To me.
Why did you not say right now?
I do not know.
I had completely forgotten.
Give us a warning.
You forgot?
You, you do what you want.
But when you cross the border with drugs,
I have a duty to stop!
Give us ...
We will talk calmly.
If my brother is not his Ventolin, he will suffocate.
Madam, you are implying it is irresponsible?
Had to think before transporting drugs.
I was not clear enough?
I will file a complaint against you!
Show me your names and your plates.
I want to see your name!
I have been lenient so far.
Go ahead, put us a fine.
Make a report.
You will hear from me!
Since you listen to me,
I arrest you!
Legs apart, hands up!
Please calm down.
You no right to do that.
I want to be searched by a female.

Open your mouth!
Do not make me ...
Good.
Follow me!
Calm down, she did nothing wrong.
I have a formality difficult to perform.
Leave it, please!

It is for nothing.

I smoke occasionally but that's it.
I should have just thrown away.
It will not happen again!
Listen ... everyone knows that the drug is not speak to the kid.
Stop acting like the hero because everybody is going.
This is not true!
It's clean.
Nothing to report.
Give him his Ventolin.
Give it to him.
Not there, it is in the backpack!
It is loose.
This is a mule.
Look good.
You think so?
Rid us of it!
What?
Do what I say!
I do not do that.

What are you doing?

What Walter means, is that ... we live in a fucking bled.
So, cars ... we do not see much.
And a 4x4 Chevrolet even less.
Fucking bled!
People disappear ...
The intelligence of this country are zero to shit.
I can tell you.
It was not always the case.
Before, there were guys intelligent guys who had values ??...
Guys who did a good job.
I speak not of you, Sheriff.
Precisely it reminds me of a story.
When I was working telephone tapping.
I love this story!
I tell you, Sheriff?
It's not always easy to hide a microphone.
During a reception or a cocktail, there are a lot of noise.
The background noise prevents to hear a conversation.
So we decided to use the auditory system of the cat.
These bugs have a hearing more developed than ours.
As directional antennas which orients in the direction of what we want to hear.
We opened a chat and we explored the auditory system.
We removed the interference using its tail which proved an excellent the receiver.
Incredible!
Several months of work and loads of money!
Finally, the cat was sent on a mission.
He said:
"You see the two guys there?
"We want to listen t'ailles their conversation.
"No birds, no dogs, no cats
"Only two."
The cat crossed the road and was run over by a taxi.
We were in the van, ready to record everything.
All that money and all these months of work in the trash!
What a fucking mess!
But what ambition!
Another coffee?
No, I have to go.
I behind in my work.
And the horseshoes?
Listen, Walter,
I do not want to disappoint you, and it is not yet confirmed, but they may cancel program Mounties.
For irons, damn it.
You will come out?
Yes, it will go.
With my savings and the disability pension of Sam, we cope.
That's good.
If you see anything, call me.
Thank you for coffee.
You do not know what it's like a 4x4 Chevrolet?
You do not know what it's like a 4x4 Chevrolet?
I'll show you, me!
It looks like that!
Stops, otherwise ...
Stop it!
It is not today you gonna break your pipe.
I'm dying.
Can not you see
I'm dying?
It will not happen to you.
While I'm here, it will not happen to you.
I am your guardian angel.
You hear?
Is there anyone?
Please!
Is there anyone? Help us!
It has been captured by customs psychopaths!
Help!
What are you doing?
Tom ...
What do you have?
You?
Above, the latch!
Try to shoot.
Arrive you there?
Go!
Go on, try to shoot!
Do not do anything!
They will return.
They will open the cages and do us harm.
Do nothing, they will kill you!
Much like you.
Do what you got to do and scoot.
He will be killed!
It's our only chance.
Did you saw Gab!
At the slightest difference, it will be killed.
It's your fault if it is there.
You're really an idiot!
If we do nothing, we will die.
We will all die!
Demeter-yourself hand and leave my brother alone!
No, you hear me?
Do not do anything!
You stay quiet!
Stop it, Michelle.
Stop it!
Please give it something to chew.
Come on, campers, wake up!
Come out, my pretty.
Beware the head!
It's good!
Mr. Dumb!
Here we go.
Get out of there.
Beware the head!
Take care of the kid!
Go!
Move!
Sir ...
Give us a drink.
Please!
Shut up!

We eat well here.
Do you like the food in this country?
So why would hurt him?
I have put a prayer rug.
Go ahead.
I am an atheist.
As you wish.
Your name?
Delta 18.
No one.
Your real name.
Delta 18.
Do not be afraid.
It's not a trap.
Tell me your real name.
Jalil.

Tell me, Jalil:
Date and place of birth?
On March 21, 1976, in Boston.
In Boston?
What is your nationality?
American.
Your true nationality.
What are you doing in the U.S.?
I am part business to GE Capital.
It's your coverage.
Please,
I do not repeat, I do not like.
What are you doing in the U.S.?
I am a sales executive ...
You lie to the camera.
You lie to your mother.
You lie in the world.
It's not you, there?
Of course it's you.
I have information on you.
While a record!
"Is what I am somebody
"Who likes to have his head the bottom of a bathtub? "
This is the question you have to ask you.
Every minute!
Let us all along.
Your name?
Leslie Goldberg.
I am a criminal lawyer.
Goldberg ...
You're Jewish?
The tick,
It stung me not by chance!
Basically, your man, Mr. Khalid, must hate you.
Jalil is my future husband!
Listen, dear, when it will explode next to you shouting
"Allah akbar! Death to the Jews!" you will do the least malignant.
I repeat: What are you doing?
I am a writer.
I also write scripts ... for the series.
Nice.
You like to tell stories?
I very badly.
Please.
I may sepsis.
I wrote a script once.
I have sent to TV stations, but I never got an answer.
As a writer, you find normal that I not respond?
I can help you.
I can help you if you want.
I know people,
I could talk to them.
This is the story of a type who is madly in love.
His girlfriend is cheating when he defends his country to war.
It happens not to forget.
Sitting!
I want names, numbers, addresses, places! Got it?
Names, numbers, addresses and places!
He said we are in the middle of nowhere ... between two worlds.
You're gay?
What is it was in your bag?
It's so hard to tell me what are you doing?
It's your life though.
I read the mail, I reply, call customers.
I read mails, I answer and call of clients.
I always do the same thing.
How do you define it?
What do you think of yourself?
I work ...
I am a good person.
I love my country.
We know when you lie.
You always know when you lie.
Jalil, your strategy going anywhere.
Should be that you are more enthusiastic today.
You do not care who I am.
Look into my eyes.
Go ...
Hands down.
Hands down!
You do not care who I am!
This is not true.
I do not care.
Please ...
Please help me.
Please ...
Help me!
One day ...
I saw ... talking in a park near his home.
He was with three men.
I had never seen.
They were djellabas and had beards.
Do you follow me?
When Jalil saw me ...
He was embarrassed, as if I did not have to witness that.
He soon éIoigné them.
He made the who do not know.
He asked me what I was doing there.
In your opinion, he knew?
Yes, I'm sure.
I beg you!
Do it.
- I beg you.
- I can not.

Whiskey.
With or without ice?
No.
You have Irish whiskey?
It has only one and it comes not from Ireland.
So what?
You decide what?
I'll take a whiskey not just in Ireland.
Of malt.
I know nothing.
I have a question ...
A question?
Go ahead.
A photo or a question?
You've already seen?
Never.
I also have a question.
What happened to them?
I am paid to know.
Are you one of these detectives those who seek it sees more, except on posters, in service stations?
Yes, you guessed it.
Another?
I do not know ...
This is the name of a woman?
That's not forget?
It's not a woman is a god.
I can see?
This is Ganesh.
I do not know.
An Indian god.
A god never comes out without his ax.
I like it.
Life is learning how to die.
The ax, that's it.
Learn how to cut links with life ... before death obliges you there.
I end while it's hot.
Sorry for the noise.
No problem.
It's a cage?
A trap instead.
This is to catch rodents around the house.
We protect our territory, what.
I see ...
It's ingenious.
Yes, that's exactly it.
You are Walter Sotos?
Yes.
Rick Brautigan, private detective.
I'm looking for people who disappeared in the region.
Hey!
They must be important.
Everyone is looking for.
Do you mind if I record?
No, if it can make you happy.
On October 7.
Interview with Walter Sotos.
I am listening.
I told you ...
The sheriff went there a few weeks.
He asked if they had seen.
They were not seen.
This may be not the same people.
I can show you pictures?
You tell me ...
It is to be sure.
Here are the youngest, he is 16.
One of the women ...
You acknowledge ...
It is a 4x4 Chevrolet?
That's them.
This is the 4x4 that the sheriff was looking for.
No, sorry.
Let me emphasize, Mr. Sotos.
I'm sure Mr. Khalid took this route.
They stopped at the gas station, just before the bifurcation.
Or they took the road leads to the main customs office, or ... they took the road of Trees that goes through here.
I talked to their families and friends and I concluded they probably wanted to avoid the main customs office because they had been drinking or something silly like that.
In short ...
You know ...
You are the only inhabitants here.
You are my only chance forward in this investigation.
We did not see anything. Hein, Walt?
As you said, it is far from the road.
M. Torrent,
I investigate the disappearance of a ...
I know, a 4x4 Chevrolet.
That is correct.
So ... you see anyone.
Indeed.
You are parents?
No.
We are friends.
For a long time?
Walt saved my life when they fought in Iraq.
On February 14, 1991.
Hein, Walt?
It creates links.
There's a saying:
"You save someone's life
"And you are responsible for him until his death. "
Not sure I understand.
It's too twisted for me.
It's like this rotten world in which we live.
You live in autarky?
We live not in autarky, we are self-sufficient, eh, Walt?
We try to support us.
We are well on their own.
What people think, their contempt ...
We head down to the grocery store and you pay without fuss.
Everything else is bullshit.
You save it?
Yes.
It concerns not the investigation.
I can stop it.
This is an RN-102?
No idea.
I can see?
Do not leave!
Analog.
Can I use your bathroom?
I drank too much milk.
This way.
Sorry!
In the corridor.
You must have been a hell of a soldier.
These are unlawful combatants.
They have no nation.
They are part of the most dangerous assassins and cruel world.
It's here.
It must be hard for you.
What?
You caught this shit in Iraq?
1 of 5 soldiers returned sick after the Gulf War.
I guess it's there ... you've nabbed.
Yes ... it is there.
I would blunder for you.

My name is Alice.
I worked for Umbrella Corporation in a secret laboratory developing experimental viral weaponry.
There was an incident.
A virus escaped.
Everybody died.
Trouble was...
...they didn't stay dead.
This was the start of an apocalypse that would sweep the entire world.
The men responsible for this disaster took refuge underground and continued to experiment with the deadly T-Virus.
They felt secure in their high-tech fortress.
But they were wrong.
Biohazard terminated.
Central Shibuya.
Confirm?
I confirm.
Nice shooting.
And I lead three to one.
The night is young.
Plenty more fish in the--
Toshi, are you okay?
Toshi, where are you?
Sentry three respond.
We lost contact with another one.
- Chairman Wesker.
- Report.
Sir, a half-hour ago, we began to lose contact with some of our perimeter sentries.
How many have we lost?
All of them.
And you waited 30 minutes to tell me?
We thought it was a communications problem. I didn't want to disturb you.
Give me the surface gate.
This is Chairman Wesker.
: Sir.
Report your situation.
Everything is quiet here.
No sign of intruders?
Hotaka.
- We have movement.
Multiple targets.
Surface gate, identify targets.
Repeat, identify targets.
Sir, Elevator 2 is moving.
I want security at that entrance.
Hey, boys.
Is that any way to treat a Lady?
Tell security to flood the main entrance with nerve gas.
Sir, our men are still up there.
Any more questions?
Intruders in Sectors 1 through 5,
7 and 8.
Reports of gunfire in Sectors 10 and 11.
Stay at your stations.
All security protocols are now in full effect.
Lock down all elevators.
Seal all internal blast doors.
And I want damage reports.
Come on, move.
- Go, go. Everybody--
- Get out.
Turbulence. Turbulence. Turbulence.
Turbulence. Turbulence.
Turbulence. Turb--
Any last words?
How nice to finally meet the real you.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Well, that's just the start of the bad news.
All those powers of yours:
Speed, strength, accelerated healing.
Well, you can kiss all those goodbye.
What have you done?
The serum I have injected you with is neutralizing the T cells within your body.
Put simply... the Umbrella Corporation is taking back its property.
You just didn't work out, so you're being recalled.
I am what you used to be.
Only better.
Please wait.
Last words?
Thank you.
For killing you?
For making me human again.
Pull up. Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Terrain. Terrain.
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
There is no infection.
We offer safety and security, food and shelter.
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
There is no infection.
While I took revenge on Umbrella, the last handful of survivors took a chopper to safety.
They were headed for a town in Alaska called Arcadia.
We'd received radio transmissions from there.
They offered food and shelter, safety and security.
A haven, free of infection.
May 3rd, 1600 hours.
A hundred and seventy-seven days without signs of life.
I am at 58.37 degrees north,
134.58 degrees west.
Closing in on the coordinates for
Arcadia, but no signs of it on any map.
I hope Claire and the others made it.
You're not coming?
Take care of the others.
Good luck, K-Mart.
Claire.
May 3rd.
1930 hours.
Arcadia.
No such place exists.
Just an empty field.
And a beach.
But we all heard the transmissions.
Someone must have sent them.
Someone must have brought all these people here.
But why?
And where did they go?
Day 177. Signing off.
I don't know if I can do this much longer.
What if I am the last one?
What if there is no one else?
No one to watch these tapes.
Is this my punishment for letting all this happen?
Hey. Wait.
Wait, please. Stop.
Hello.
Hello?
Answer me.
Hey, hey.
It's okay.
Sorry about that.
But I had to get this thing off of you.
What is this?
Who did this to you?
Do you even know who I am?
My name is Alice.
We met in the Nevada desert 18 months ago.
Any of this sound familiar?
Mikey, Carlos, L.J.?
K-Mart?
You left in a helicopter with a group of survivors headed for Alaska.
Arcadia, remember?
Arcadia, remember?
Arcadia, remember?
May 4th, 0800 hours.
Potting a course for Prince Rupert in British Columbia.
I will pass Vancouver, drop down to Seattle.
After that, it's San Francisco and the rest of the Western seaboard.
My passenger is still as talkative as ever.
Whatever that thing was, it was injecting her with some sort of drug.
Something that causes memory loss.
I just hope the effects aren't permanent.
Your name... is Alice, right?
She speaks.
Look, I am sorry about back there.
I don't know what happened.
I don't remember anything.
I don't even know my name.
It's Claire.
Claire Redfield.
Claire?
Sound familiar?
Not really.
You will get used to it.
Perhaps you can cut me loose now.
We should get to know each other a little better first.
City of Angels.
May 6th, 1800 hours, Los Angeles.
No signs of life.
Not even the undead.
Some must have burnt with the city.
But what about the rest?
Oh, my God.
What?
Look over there.
Damn.
It's a plane.
It's a plane.
I knew it.
I told you they would come.
Hey, we're down here. Hello.
No way we're getting in there.
Where is he going?
Why is he flying away?
It's not flying away.
It's circling. Circling?
Damn, he's low.
Down.
What the hell is he doing?
He's going to land.
He's going to land.
Get the stuff out of the way.
Land?
Yeah.
Land.
That is one crazy son of a bitch.
This may get a little rough.
Then cut me loose.
Thanks.
Just don't do anything crazy, all right?
Nothing as crazy as what you have in mind.
Come on, Kim, move it.
I am trying.
Well, try.
All right, hold on.
Hurry, he's coming.
Come on.
Come on, pull it. Come on.
Come on, pull.
Good. Good.
Good work.
That's it.
Good job.
Nice landing.
I think technically it's called crashing.
Luther West.
Alice. That's Claire.
Luther West. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Hi, my name's Crystal.
- No, no.
Enough with the introductions.
So you're here to help us, right?
Can you get us out?
You from Arcadia?
What did you say?
Are you from Arcadia?
What do you know about Arcadia?
- They said they'd help.
There are survivors.
Civilization and safety.
Infection free.
So they sent you, right?
No.
But there are others out there like you?
It's just us.
There's to be no rescue?
I am sorry.
Sorry.
Look, don't take it so bad.
They had their hopes up and...
Thought you could take them to the promised land.
Angel Ortiz.
That was some fine flying.
Thanks.
What's the prognosis?
She will live.
Yeah.
You know,
I have the strangest feeling
I know you.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
You're a sports fan, huh?
Do you like basketball?
Not really.
No? Oh.
Well, maybe just a fan of fine timepieces.
Yeah.
Luther here is our resident superstar.
So tell me about Arcadia.
What exactly do you know?
Just from their transmissions.
We have been receiving their broadcast all week.
Food and shelter, safety and security, no infection.
We thought they sent you.
We have been launching flares for days to get their attention.
Flares?
- Yeah.
Who's going to see flares from Alaska?
Alaska?
Alaska?
Arcadia. I have been there.
It's in Alaska.
It's a town, or so we thought.
A town?
I don't think so.
Take a look.
At what?
You see?
It's not a town.
It's a ship.
I recorded this from the shortwave.
This is
Arcadia, on the emergency frequency.
There is no infection.
We offer safety and security, food and shelter.
It's the same message we heard.
They must have salled down the coast, picking up survivors.
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
What is that?
I don't know.
That was the last we heard from them.
Then it just stopped.
That was two days ago.
We have been sending up flares on the hour.
So when you arrived, of course, we thought they sent you.
Claire.
That ship over there.
That's Arcadia.
I know.
You remember?
I remember the beach.
People were coming to help us.
What happened?
Why didn't you go with the others?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
We have to get to that ship.
We have to get to that ship.
Welcome to your new home, cell block B.
Crystal's our cook.
The menu's not extensive, but she is a master of what she does.
Sorry I didn't bring better news.
Get used to disappointment, right?
That's what my agent used to say.
Were you an actress?
I came to Hollywood, ended up waiting tables.
Why are we waiting? Excuse me. I am hungry. Thank you.
Get out of here, man.
- Thank you.
I met plenty of creeps like him in my time.
What's his story?
Back in the world, he was some kind of big movie producer.
The boy's got a stick up his ass.
Kim Yong used to intern for him. Still hasn't figured the world has changed.
That plane, do you think it could still fly?
It can fly, but it only seats two.
So take us to Arcadia one at a time.
Look, I think she was lucky to land here once.
Five or six times would be suicide.
No offence.
None taken.
There has to be another way out.
We have to get to that ship.
Well, there is the--
What?
Nothing.
Look, it would be a waste of your time.
I have time to waste.
When the shit hit the fan, we took refuge in the prison.
It seemed like it had the biggest, strongest walls.
The best chance of keeping those things out.
By the time we got here, the guards and the inmates were already long gone.
I guess when people started eating one another, there wasn't much point in keeping anybody locked up.
We thought the place was abandoned, until we made a discovery.
Wendell, time to take a break.
It's about god-damn time.
I hate being down here.
I am hearing movement in the walls.
So let's check it out.
I will be back in a minute.
Come on.
Name's Chris.
You were the one flying that plane.
How do you know that?
Wendell isn't the only one that hears things.
I am glad you made it.
Maybe you can talk some sense into these people.
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
I am not a prisoner.
I shouldn't be in here.
I was working with a military unit.
We were using this place as a staging post.
Things were already bad when the order came through to release all the inmates.
We needed as many people on the streets as possible to fight those things.
And it was chaos.
We were pulling out and a gang of the prisoners jumped me.
I guess they thought I was a guard.
I woke up, my unit was gone.
I was in here.
Their idea of a joke.
You don't believe me.
Do the others?
You need to get me out of here.
We're all trapped here.
That's true.
But I can help you.
Seen enough?
You find anything?
No.
I know a way out of this place.
If you get me out of here,
I will do the same for you.
You're going to need me.
Have you checked what he's talking about?
His way out?
He's not telling us shit till we let him out. And I am not letting him out.
The man is a killer.
Really?
I can see it in his eyes.
How can you be so sure?
I know people.
Interesting.
So tell me.
What do you see when you look into my eyes?
Whoa.
Holy shit.
Girl's got to be prepared.
What would you possibly want with those?
It's a hobby.
A hobby?
All right.
Well, I will see you in the morning.
No sign of anyone on deck.
Your friends are out there?
I think so.
You don't remember?
It's coming back.
Slowly.
Nothing that makes any sense.
We still have running water.
That's very civilized.
We do our best.
It's cold.
Our best only goes so far.
These are for you.
Thank you.
I guess I should leave you to it.
I guess you should.
I will be right outside.
Thank you.
Luther?
Take it easy, honey. Move it.
Okay, I am just going to be on my way now.
Okay, take it easy.
Take it easy.
Get out of my sight.
What is that smell?
Must have burrowed up from the sewers.
Wendell said he heard things moving.
What? So these things can just burst out anywhere?
We got to get out of this place.
Arcadia will send help.
No one's coming to get us.
Okay? No one.
We have to help ourselves.
This plane that you have.
Won't hold everybody.
Well, we can draw straws.
- No.
We all get out of here and no one gets left behind.
Great.
How are we going to do that?
Walk out of here, just single file?
Are you crazy?
They didn't want him getting out.
- He's dangerous.
Angel, what do you think?
I think we don't have much of a choice.
This is insane.
Crystal, Crystal, look at me. What do you think?
I mean, not even you're that dumb.
I guess I am. I agree with Angel.
If this guy thinks he knows a way out, I want to hear it.
All right.
Seriously?
This is a mistake.
This is a big mistake.
You better keep your eyes on him.
I was wondering how long it would take.
Boo.
I-- all right, let's get the hell out of here.
Claire?
What?
Claire, it's me.
It's Chris.
I don't know you.
Claire.
I am your brother, remember?
What the hell's happened to you?
It's okay.
Let him go.
Look, she suffered some sort of memory loss.
If you really are her brother, it will come back.
All right, this is very touching.
I mean the family reunion.
If we could just get a move on, please, before we're all eaten the fuck alive.
Behind those doors is a
UPV, urban pacification vehicle.
The prison kept it in case of a serious riot.
Sixteen-wheeler, steel plate, water cannon. It seats 20.
Ten tons of fun.
We roll on out in style, drive right over them.
The lock's jammed.
But we can cut through it.
When we hit the coast, we have to transfer to a boat.
We're going to need more fire-power.
- I got you covered.
When I was stationed here, we used the basement as an armoury.
It's got every weapon you can dream of.
How do you know your unit didn't take them with them?
Because by the end there were more guns than there were people to use them.
You go get the guns. Luther.
Oh, my God.
What is this?
They had pumps to keep the water out of the foundations.
When the electricity failed, some of the lower levels started filling up.
There's another two floors down there.
And how far down is the armoury?
All the way.
Luther, come on.
Get back. Get back.
Where do you think you're going?
I was a swim champ back in high school.
Is that right?
Here.
You're going to trust me with a gun?
Yeah. Why not?
Luther, just shoot that mother-fucker.
What the fuck is that thing?
All right.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Nice.
Damn.
There must be hundreds of them out there.
We can't go back that way.
Oh, shit.
What do you mean, "oh, shit"?
What--?
What is this?
What do you think it is?
Don't tell me that thing fits inside of there.
Can you put this back together?
Maybe, but it could take a week.
What do we do now?
I know.
Bennett, what have you done?
Luther, we got to get out of here. Come on.
Did you hear that?
Come on, baby. Come on.
What are we doing?
Getting out.
But the others.
Fuck the others.
Now, get on-board.
Bennett, what are you doing?
Hey.
Kim Yong. Don't do this.
Open this door.
Bennett, please.
Bennett.
Oh, shit.
That's right, bitch. Fuck you.
Yes. Yes.
Son of a bitch.
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
He's headed for the Arcadia.
Alice.
Come on.
Head for the shower block.
Move.
I will meet you there.
This thing has no power.
We won't need power.
Oh, shit.
Hold on.
Hey, head to the shower block. Go.
Over here.
Are you all right?
I am fine. Thanks.
This is some kind of joke, right?
The tunnels lead to the sewers, the sewers lead to the storm drain.
This storm drain leads to the sea.
It's our only chance.
I will take point.
I got your back.
Ladies.
All right, you're next.
I can't do it.
You can.
Let's go.
Aah.
Shh.
Those things are close.
We found a way out just down there.
The tunnels drop into a storm drain.
Go. Be careful.
Where's Kim Yong?
Go. Go.
I knew you'd make it.
Luther.
Help.
Luther.
You can't help him now.
We have to move on.
No welcome party, huh?
It looks like Bennett made it.
Let's check inside.
Did you find anyone?
Nothing.
I checked the crew quarters. They're all gone.
Looks like they left in a hurry.
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
There is no infection. We offer safety and security, food and shelter.
Fuel, power, everything's running normally.
Look at this.
It's the ship's log.
The crew launched the lifeboats three days ago.
Exactly when the transmissions stopped.
But it says there are still 2000 survivors on-board.
We have to search every inch of this ship.
Umbrella.
Of course.
I remember them coming for us.
This whole thing, Arcadia, was a lie.
No, it's worse than that.
It's a trap.
Where is everybody?
I don't understand.
I think I do.
They're underneath our feet.
They're holding survivors to experiment on them.
Look.
It's K-Mart. She's here.
Bring them up.
All of them.
Here she is.
K-Mart.
Get her out.
K-Mart, it's okay.
It's okay.
K-Mart, it's all right.
I will get this off her.
Let everyone out.
We're your friends.
Right now, we need your help.
Let me get this off you.
Why am I not surprised?
You weren't too hard to find.
Our satellite system is still operational.
And there aren't too many people flying nowadays.
And besides, I always knew you'd be drawn to your friends.
Loyalty, highly overrated.
Stop.
Down.
Wouldn't want you harming my pets.
Drop your guns.
Thank you.
Kick them to me.
Good.
You don't look so good, Bennett.
Yeah, I am looking forward to playing with your pretty face.
What do you want from me?
The T-Virus brought me back.
But it's so strong.
It fights me for control.
I thought if I ingested fresh human DNA,
I could redress the balance.
No wonder your crew abandoned ship.
No matter.
Now I have a new subordinate.
And a new plan.
You were the only one who successfully bonded with the T-Virus.
Your DNA is stronger than the others.
I ingest you,
I gain control.
That's pretty smart thinking.
There's only one problem with that plan.
Stop right there.
And what is that?
I am not on the menu.
Well, isn't this one big family reunion?
Chris and Claire Redfield.
You have really become quite an inconvenience for me.
I told you
I'd be bringing a few friends.
You should have brought more.
Claire. Claire.
Chris.
Don't even think about it.
Who the fuck are you?
I don't think so.
Don't-- Don't you shut them.
I am a producer.
Open those doors.
You are going to deal with some serious consequences.
You mother-fuckers.
Open the--
You're going to live to regret this, all of you.
Oh, God.
I just want to go home.
Hey, it's going to be okay.
No.
Chris. Alice.
Come on.
I didn't want you to miss that.
Oh, heh, heh.
That's right.
Star power, bitches.
It's a miracle.
I never dreamed there would be this many of us left alive.
So, what's next?
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency--
I say... we live up to the promise.
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the emergency frequency.
Location 118.30 degrees west,
34.05 degrees north.
There is no infection.
Repeat, there is no infection.
We offer safety and security, food and shelter.
If you are out there, we will help you.
There is hope.
What is that?
Trouble.
Deployment in T-minus 57 seconds.
When you hit the deck, you watch your formation.
Take no prisoners and shoot to kill.
Total enemy numbers are unknown but will include Umbrella fugitives and prime targets.
Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield and Project Alice.
So, people, whatever's waiting for you out there, just know one thing:
You are going to be in for the fight of your lives.
Hey, boys.
Is that any way to treat a lady?
Now, the Book of
Revelation tells us the Rapture is the literal, physical bodily coming of
Christ in the clouds to snatch out of this world all believers, the dead and living who were in Christ our Lord, amen.
Those sinners who remain on Earth shall face torments and suffer beyond their wildest nightmares.
Who are these people?
Well, we all know them.
Musicians, gays, gay musicians, the entire 1997 Denver Broncos, and all of Hollywood.
Um, it was incredibly freaky, to me, anyway.
I always say that Ben sort of saved the world.
He's that amazing.
Well, he says that I saved the world, but he's probably just being nice.
It doesn't matter.
That's me, looking fairly shocked.
But honestly, not that shocked, because the truth is, a lot of crazy stuff had already gone down.
Wow.
Maybe I should back up a little.
See, it all started with the Rapture.
It was league night.
I had just gotten a strike.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God!
And Ben was even more excited than me.
He usually is.
Which is why I love him.
Anyway, um...
Then, all of a sudden, half the world was totally gone.
The people who went to church and prayed and missed out on a lot of fun stuff got sucked straight up to Heaven.
And the rest of us, well, we were screwed.
We weren't believers, so I guess that's why we weren't taken.
Both my mom and Ben's mom went to church religiously.
Well, that's the only way you can go to church.
The point is, they both got raptured.
But, in the only recorded case of such a thing happening, my mother was sent back the very next day.
Mom?
Oh.
Laura.
What happened?
I don't know.
I was in Heaven.
Wait.
You got sent back?
So God, like, returned you?
Well.
I guess so. Yes.
Aw!
I was just in line.
Uh-huh.
And they were giving out massages.
And a guy butt in front of me.
He probably didn't butt.
He barged right in front of me, and he said,
"I need something in the shoulder."
Were you in the right line?
I was in the right line.
Honey, you are almost never in the right line.
Listen to me. It was unprofessional.
It was poorly organized.
You have this backwards.
You go up there to be judged.
You don't do the judging.
Mom. Aw!
I don't want to be here.
I'd hug you, but you smell like shit.
Did anybody vacuum while I was gone?
We all vacuumed.
We all vacuumed all the time.
Lots of vacuuming.
And then the torments started.
First came these little locusty things.
Ow!
I hate those little things.
Suffer! Suffer!
I am suffering, you little buttwipe!
Suffer!
You're not going anywhere, you little fucker!
If you're wondering, they were impervious to most bug sprays.
Suffer!
I got an idea!
How about you suffer?
Suffer!
Suffer!
This apocalypse is killing me!
Why? Why?
I don't know why, you Jesus freak!
Why don't you ask God?
Oh, yeah, I forgot!
He doesn't like you!
That's my parents, you guys.
I can't stand it any longer!
Good times.
Then God, in his infinite wisdom, did this really gross thing.
It just seemed so unsanitary, you know?
What is that?
Is that...
I think it's raining blood.
Blood? It's raining blood.
That's not disgusting.
What the fuck is the point of that?
There's no point!
I know.
Wipers don't work for shit.
Try the sprayer thing.
Sprayer thing.
Well, that's great.
Now it's all smeared.
The wraiths showed up about a year ago.
They went all around the world wrecking everything, and killing people.
Holy cow!
Monsters, man.
Real monsters.
Without the costumes.
Because the costumes are real, you know.
So, a lot of people died during the apocalypse.
The only one I know who came back was my neighbor!
Mr. Murphy.
We all thought it was weird that instead of chasing us around, trying to eat our delicious brains, all he did was mow his lawn.
Maybe it was on his mind when he died.
Uh, I don't know.
Finally this neighbor got so sick of it that he stole the mower.
But then Mr. Murphy just walked around without the mower.
This is sad.
Hello, Mr. Murphy.
Your lawn looks really nice.
Have a good day,
Mr. Murphy.
And just as the Bible predicted, the Antichrist finally showed up.
Nobody thought his name would be Earl Gundy, though.
Certainly not that he'd be from Idaho.
I might take you to rock bottom, but I'm going to bring you back up...
And I guess not really a surprise that the Antichrist was a politician first.
...because I'm Earl Gundy, and we can make it.
And then he gets invited to the White House.
He poisons everyone's sandwiches, and then just starts using our missiles
...evacuation of Chicago has not been fast enough.
He blew up a bunch of cities.
Chicago, Tokyo, London.
You know, just to make everybody scared of him.
We go now to Orlando.
Oh, come on!
Not Orlando!
Oh, man! Come on!
Think of all those ride operators.
They're just kids!
Oh, and he makes everyone call him "The Beast," because he thinks it makes him sound cool.
Everyone thought he was going to live in some palace in the Middle-East, but he settled right here.
In my home town.
Not biblically referenced,
Seattle.
Overall, I'd say the Book of Revelation's got most of what has happened pretty much right.
There were some things that happened that weren't predicted.
Like the foul-mouthed crows, for instance.
Strawberry jam.
Oh, nice.
That's right.
Hey, you!
Yeah, you.
Fuck you! Caw!
Ben, baby, just ignore that.
Man, I hate those guys.
I mean, why do we just let them insult us like this?
I know.
Eat shit, fucker.
Hold on. No. Mmm-mmm.
Not worth it.
Hey! Blow me!
And don't forget my balls. Caw!
Yeah, don't forget my balls, you stupid crow.
I'm sorry. You're right.
It's not worth it.
Yeah! Walk away, pussy!
Caw!
Felch me! Caw!
I just don't think that that bird knows what he's saying. Yeah.
It's just a noise coming out of their mouth.
Fuck them!
No, no, no.
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Caw!
Ben and I had this idea of starting our own sandwich cart.
Because people appreciate a good sandwich, even when the world is ending.
Maybe, especially when the world is ending.
That one is better.
That's the horseradish.
Mmm.
I couldn't find any mustard, so...
I think it goes well with it.
Yeah, it's really...
Kind of makes up for it.
Stay calm.
It's okay.
After a while, you just get used to the locusts and the blood rain, and...
Oh! And the fiery rocks falling from the sky.
Is that Trevor Burdick?
Oh, yeah.
I think it is.
Trevor, get inside, man.
I ain't scared!
Bring it on!
Wow, he's so dumb.
An idiot.
Trevor...
Mmm.
That was horrible.
Yeah. Well...
What?
No, it was horrible.
It's terrible.
What were you going to say?
Nothing.
What were you going to say?
I mean, come on, the guy is standing there with his hands up, yelling,
"Bring it on." He's stupid.
He's an idiot.
Am I wrong?
No. That's not funny. That's a...
It's human life, you know.
Dumb, dumb human life.
No, that's not funny, Ben.
That's sad.
He's a dummy.
You want to, uh...
Yeah. Later, baby. My parents are going to be home any second.
Later, like...
No.
No?
See. Home.
Kill me.
Is the therapy helping your mom at all?
Yeah. She seems to be crying a lot less.
She still says
"why" a lot, though.
Oh, that's good.
Rocks. Baby.
Come on.
Sounds close.
You go up there and he kicks you right back down.
You might as well have had the sugar.
Dad!
No!
Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why?
My eggs.
My eggs.
That day was the worst day of my life.
Which is saying something in the apocalypse.
I didn't know how to feel.
The apocalypse was hard and stressful for everybody.
My brother Clark and his idiot friend Fry were actually into it.
But I think that's because they were idiots before the Rapture, so...
Where are you going, Clark?
Oh, uh, Fry and I are gonna kayak the blood river.
I don't think that's a good idea, Clark.
Whatever.
Clark!
Hey, Clark.
Hey, buddy. Be careful out on the river, okay?
Because your mom could seriously not handle anything bad...
Dude, suck it.
Keep any open wounds covered.
Later, asswipe.
Asswipe!
Be careful of the wraiths, Clark.
The wraiths have been here a while now, and they're still bad,
I guess.
Like, some of them still work for The Beast.
But a lot of them are basically unemployed, and they don't really have anything to do.
So, a lot of them have become serious potheads.
You know, joints or a bag.
Dude, forget it.
You still didn't pay for the last bag.
Look, I'll pay you.
No. Forget it.
I will destroy you.
We will destroy you.
Wow, I'm so scared right now.
Just one joint, man.
Fuck! Fine, here you go.
- Thanks, man.
- Thanks, bro.
Do you ever fucking bathe?
Are you still seeing Catherine?
Yeah, she's intense.
You shouldn't let bitches push you around.
Everyone was struggling to get by now, except the people who made a deal with the devil.
I mean, they were on his payroll.
And you've recently split from your wife of eight years, Kimberlee, why?
Well, she's kind of a stupid, vapid whore, Liz.
I'm just kidding.
And now she's off in Los
Angeles trying to be an actress.
Good luck.
I prefer to be right here in Seattle.
Go Mariners.
Are there any romantic prospects for The Beast?
The problem with most of the women
I meet is that they are all sluts, you know.
And I'm looking for somebody who is, uh, old fashioned.
The girl next door.
With a nice rack and a nice round...
See. Right there.
I can't see you.
I'm right there behind him.
Right there with the mustache.
Oh, yeah.
Not bad, huh?
Your old man's on global
TV there, Benjamin.
If you ask my opinion, the guy has gotten a bad rap.
He's the Antichrist, Dad.
"He's the Antichrist.
He's the Antichrist."
I'm just saying, he has done a couple of good things, so sue me.
Like what?
Seriously, like what?
Okay, well, for instance, um,
He is the most evil individual who has ever lived, Mr. H.
"The most evil individual who has ever lived" is paying the bills around here.
I'm just saying, he's not as bad as everybody says. That's all.
He blew up Chicago, Mr. H.
I am not saying I support everything he has done, Lindsey.
I was totally against that, and I said so at the time.
There is no good reason to blow up Chicago.
Except for the food, the weather, and the people.
Okay. Now, you are defending him blowing up Chicago.
No, I'm not, Ben.
I'm just providing context.
You know what?
You guys should come work with me.
Then, you would see the deal.
No, we are not going to be
Beastly Guards, Dad.
You don't have to be a Beastly Guard.
You could work in the shop.
And you could do the kitchen with the other gals.
Yeah, a couple of guys just quit.
Well, they didn't quit, per se. They were laid off.
Let go. Killed.
Look, they were working against him, Ben.
I mean, what's he supposed to do?
Give them a raise?
You are so morally lost.
Hey! Kiddo, I'm just saying that's the way the world works, and you are not exactly raking in the dough at the homeless shelter.
Somebody has to help those people, Mr. H.
Are you trying to be good or something so that you get raptured?
Because,
I'm telling you, kids, that was a one-time dealy, okay?
And this one up here, forget about it.
You are not going anywhere with all the carrying on in your room.
You'd think masturbating powered the lights around here.
Hey, I'm not going anywhere either, Ben, okay?
Your mommy is going to be up there all by her lonesome.
I miss you, babe.
We are going to work on the sandwich cart. Uh-huh.
Hey, health insurance.
Dental.
They cover acupuncture,
Lindsey.
Thanks for the pizza.
"Thanks for the pizza."
I never liked you.
Kids.
World's Most
Embarrassing Raptures.
Ha! The rapture show is on.
What the fuck?
This guy is on a toilet.
I saw it coming and I still laughed.
You know, I was thinking, if this goes well, and we make a little money,
I think we should move out of our parents' and get a place together.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Maybe get married and start a family.
I mean, would you really want kids?
In a world like this?
Things are bound to get better at some point, right? So...
Maybe that point is right now.
Just humor me.
I'll humor you.
Come on.
Come inside.
Are you kidding me?
What the fuck?
I'm fucking done with this shit!
No. Come on. Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
I really, really loved that food cart idea, Ben. I did, I did. I did.
I very much wanted to see you kids succeed at that, but let's not kid ourselves here.
It is not easy to make money these days.
Well, we're only going to do it until we have enough money to rebuild the cart, Dad.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
A month, max.
But people will tell you cardio all the time.
And...
There he is. Hey.
How is it going today?
Oh, let's see.
Oh, this is yours.
Yeah.
"Dickhead."
Says it right there.
No. That's not what it says.
Who are these?
This is my son and his girlfriend.
Just bringing them to work today.
Your father's an asshole.
Just so you know.
We have fun.
No, we don't.
He's just having fun.
No, I'm not.
A real joker this one.
Not with this guy.
We've got a minivan coming in.
It's not a minivan.
Soccer mom coming through.
Not a minivan.
Okay. Well, fuck you.
Oh, really? Fuck me?
Fuck you!
A real asshole.
Now, The Beast isn't here, so everything is kind of chill.
Pretty cool of your old man to be showing you around on his day off, huh?
I am going to put you kids by the pool area.
It's a very kick back assignment.
You are going to love it.
Hey, Margie, flowers look great.
Don't look anybody in the eye, okay?
I'm serious.
Don't look anybody in the eye.
This is it. This is the pool.
Gorgeous, huh?
Now, you gotta be careful, because there are landmines all over the place.
Holy dick and balls.
What is it?
The Beast.
He's coming down.
What for?
I have no idea.
Okay, but listen. Whatever he says, you just say yes.
Let's go, guys.
Line it up.
So, don't say anything.
Don't even say yes.
Okay, I'll say yes.
Walt.
Hey, Morgan.
No matter what happens, you say yes.
I know the deal.
"I know the deal."
All clear here, boss!
Well, what a treat for me.
Delightful to meet you, young man.
A real chip off the old block.
And you are handsome and intelligent...
Little Beast has some special requirements for the pool area.
Uh... I'm sorry?
The pool area.
You heard me say pool area, right?
Yes.
Where are we standing right now?
The pool area.
Yeah.
The motherfucking pool!
Shut up!
Okay.
But I'm not...
Yeah.
Are you dumb or just stupid?
Yeah, of course.
The pool area.
What can I do you for?
Tell him what you want,
Little Beast.
- The Beast.
- Hey, Earl!
You never call me back!
Kim. Slow down.
Tell him what you want.
I want a big slide.
Okay.
Hey, Earl...
My name is not Earl, okay.
It's Beast.
I don't give a shit what you call yourself.
You're still an asshole.
I will fuck your shit up!
Goodbye, Kimberlee.
Don't you fucking hang up on me! Don't you...
I hate you!
I wish you were dead.
Very funny.
Right back at you, kid.
We need this done by next week. You got it?
Yes. Of course.
Go back to the cart,
Little Beast.
Next week.
Who's your assistant, contractor? Huh?
Oh! Nobody.
That's my son, Ben.
No. Not Rachel Maddow.
That is his girlfriend,
Lindsey.
I'm a pool contractor now?
Shut your mouth.
What am I supposed to do?
This is what I deal with every day.
Welcome, Lindsey.
Uh, thank you.
Can I get you anything?
Some iced tea?
Mocha? Latte?
Hot dog?
Corn on the cob? Sausage?
Other dick-shaped food?
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Yes. Yes, you are.
Mmm.
He's a children's asshole, but he's an asshole.
You son of a bitch.
Thanks for leaving me out to dry.
Do you want to go for a walk around the premises?
Oh...
I just...
I'm not a man you want to say no to, my dear.
Oh.
Come on.
Come. Come. No pun intended.
Okay, pun very much intended.
I won't bite you. Come on.
Okay.
Back to work, contractor.
Yes, sir.
Back to the house,
Little Beast.
But, Dad!
Get the fuck back in the house now! Fucker.
Fuck!
We are traveling.
We are traveling.
Fuck!
Fuck!
No, this is bullshit.
Don't.
Don't.
No, but...
Don't.
Listen, these people will kill you as soon as look at you.
I'm not going to let the Antichrist steal my girlfriend, Dad.
Oh, come on.
What are you going to do?
Challenge him to a fight?
I don't know.
But I'm going to do something.
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
Look, they're just talking.
You need to believe in me, Dad. Oh.
Believe in you, Ben?
Really?
Yes!
Come on!
You are delicious.
You know that?
I bet your vagina tastes like pistachio mint ice cream.
Low fat.
Tell me, Lindsey, what's a gorgeous girl like yourself doing in a job like this?
Well, my boyfriend,
Ben, and I...
Ex-boyfriend.
I'm just kidding.
Not really. Go ahead.
Yeah, we were starting this sandwich business and, um, our cart got crushed by one of those falling rocks.
Ooh.
Bad luck.
Right. So, now we're just working with his dad.
Bad luck for you, but good luck for me. Huh?
You look like a cross between
Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank.
Did anyone ever tell you that, Lindsey?
No.
You got to be kidding me.
What did you say? Scarlett Johansson,
Hilary Swank. Fucking, yeah...
Shut up.
Both lovely ladies with lovely racks, like yourself.
I have a wonderful, spontaneous idea.
Let's have sex in these bushes right here.
What?
Yeah. What do you think?
Don't fight the impulse now, Lindsey.
Uh... No, I don't...
That's okay. No, thank you.
I really don't want to do that.
What?
I don't want to do that.
Why not?
I think you do.
No, I don't.
Come on. Why not?
So many reasons. I, uh...
I just don't do that.
You don't what?
What are you, a virgin?
You are?
Really?
Well, yeah.
Whoa! A virgin?
Whoo! Did you hear that?
They are hard to find.
Winner! You a virgin?
That's great.
Honey need a little slap.
Girl's going to give it up to you, sir.
Shut your mouth!
I'm so sorry.
Where are your sunglasses?
Mine fell in the koi pond.
It's not a big deal.
No, it is to me. Yeah.
You got to take it to the hole, sir.
Mmm-hmm.
I probably shouldn't have said anything.
No, I get it. You want your first time to be special, beautiful.
Yeah.
And so it will be.
I promise you, your first time, no anal.
This way, my dear.
I don't care, Dad.
I'm going to punch that guy in the face.
Ben, come on.
Be reasonable.
No, I am.
Ow!
Oh, shit.
We just met though, so...
And at first, I swear, I thought you were just another hot piece of ass, but a virgin! Ohhh!
That is really something.
Fuck you all.
That's rude.
You know, I'm no good at this type of thing, but...
Fuck it. Marry me, Lindsey.
Marry me and become the mother of my evil offspring.
What?
I know!
Call me impetuous.
Call me an incurable romantic, but something in my gut tells me you're the one for me.
Okay, you already have a son, though.
Little Beast is a dud.
I need more children, a mini-bus full, you know?
You all right, Ben?
You hit me with a shovel?
Only a little bit.
You are having reservations, aren't you, my dear?
Yes.
I can tell.
This is a horse.
It's big.
I want to show you something, Lindsey.
Not that. Not yet.
You will see my penis later.
Oh.
I am going to get that guy.
Ben, come on!
What? Are you going to hit me again?
Shit. Shit.
I gotta get him out of here.
I know exactly what you are worried about, Lindsey.
You do?
"But, Mr. Beast.
"As much as I'm attracted to you, and I am.
"The truth is, I'm scared.
"If I marry you and become your evil queen,
"won't people despise me?
"Won't I become a target, just like you?
"And unlike you, if I'm killed,
I won't return as 'Satan.'"
Why am I using air quotes?
I will be Satan.
Yeah, um, actually...
Hey, hey, hey...
You will become a target, but there is a weapon here that very few people know about.
That's a...
Yes.
A real live
XGLTLGL laser beam.
Or something.
All right.
See, there's this rumor going around, this prediction of sorts, that before long, someone who shall remain nameless,
Jesus, is going to come down from the sky and vanquish me.
Oh.
Yeah. But I don't think so.
Oh! Oh, wow!
Do you see that crow?
Hey, fuckers. Toss my salad!
Okay.
Primer set.
Whoo!
Yeah! Bam!
Yeah! Toss my salad, crow! Suck my balls!
That big motherfucker up there has no idea who he is dealing with.
I call it my you-know-who buster.
Uh-huh.
Excuse me.
Oh.
So, you see, my dear, you will be perfectly safe here with me.
So, what do you say?
No!
Thank you.
Fine. All right.
I understand. Um...
Of course, I've got to kill everyone you know, starting with your boyfriend and his father.
What?
Your choice, my dear.
No, wait! Uh...
If I could just have a little time to think about it.
Of course.
You have eight hours.
And in that time, if you are not back here, ready to marry me and bear my evil children,
I will kill everyone you know.
Sound fair?
Okay.
Ohhh! I feel so good about this, don't you?
Take the rest of the day off, Lindsey.
Get ready for tonight.
Paint your toenails, trim your bush, bleach your asshole, douche, whatever.
Eight hours, remember?
Ohhh.
Don't trim your bush too much now.
Okay.
Adieu, Lindsey, adieu.
Bye.
Toodle-oo!
Slow this bitch down!
It's fucking with my vertigo, motherfucker.
Jesus, Dad.
I'm not saying it's good or right, Benjamin.
I'm just saying he's the Antichrist, here, and you are you.
Thank you.
You know what I'm saying.
He's like a god.
Which is ironic, if you think about it.
Maybe Lindsey will like it. Huh?
Lindsey is not going to like it.
How do you know?
Because she likes me. Right?
You don't like him.
Hey, how do we know anything?
No! I know she likes me!
"I know she likes me."
That's what you sound like right now.
Why would you mock me?
You are such a terrible father.
Hey, Linds.
Um...
I just wanted to say that you know, ever since your father was squashed by a big giant rock,
I feel like a father to you.
You know?
And as your father,
I feel like
I just have to say
I just think you have to go with The Beast here.
Thanks for the advice.
And of course, if you don't, and he kills Ben and I, and not to mention your mom and your brother, and who knows who else, then as long as you are happy with that, that is all that matters.
You know?
Because that means your honor was more important to you than we are.
She is not going to go with The Beast, Dad.
I know, Ben.
I know.
Your mom is going to have a meltdown.
We're cursed,
Lindsey! Cursed!
Why! Why, Lindsey?
Why are we so cursed?
Why? Why? Why? Why?
Maybe because you are so annoying?
I am not annoying, Clark.
I am a woman with feelings.
Oh, my God! I'm going to be in-laws with the Antichrist.
Poor me. I like to cry all the time.
I hate Clark.
Mom, just deal with it, okay? God!
Why!
Clark, be nicer to Mom.
Okay, Linds, what's your problem?
This is what you gotta do.
You go with this Beast guy, you have a great night out, and at the end, you fucking knife the shit out of him.
If I knife him he comes back as Satan.
Okay, then fucking knife Satan, too.
I don't know.
Just keep on knifing him, don't stop.
That's not going to work.
Oh, uh, my sister's supposed to marry The Beast.
Oh, congrats, Linds, that's great.
No, we're going to kill him.
Yeah, I just said that.
She should fucking knife him.
Fucking knife him.
Just grab a knife and...
Just fucking knife him in the chest and watch his insides pour out.
Vick, I told you not to come here before 2:00.
You got a serious problem with pot.
You know that, wraith?
What? Me? Come on, guys.
It's me! Vick!
When was the last time you went one day without weed?
Um... Yesterday.
Really?
If you are going to do this much you should get a vaporizer.
Okay. I know.
It's a cry for help and you know it.
Mom, are you okay?
Honey, I just...
Do it, Lindsey.
Go with The Beast.
Please. Please. Please.
Mom!
Please. Please.
I can't stand another bad thing happening to this family.
I can't stand it. I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!
I am not marrying that evil idiot, okay?
He's not killing everybody I love.
There is a plan to deal with this and Ben and I are going to think of it.
Okay. Okay.
If you're going to stand there at least do it while you're making us coffee, okay?
Okay.
I love you.
I'm sorry I hit you.
Bye, Ben.
I'm going to make coffee!
What about that guy you knew?
Uh...
The mob guy,
Gina Pagano's cousin.
It's a good idea.
He got raptured, though.
He did?
I'm starting to think that maybe we should have just gone to church with our moms.
Believed. You know?
Yeah, but if you don't, you don't. You know?
What if we really are cursed?
We're not.
But what if we are?
We're not.
We have gotten through a lot.
We are going to get through this.
Uh-huh.
Because we just are. kick the Antichrist's ass myself, I will.
I know. I know.
I'll do it.
Did you find anything?
We definitely can't kill him, because of the whole
"possessed by Satan" thing.
Right. The only ones who can kill-kill him are Jesus and God, right?
Right, but it does seem like he could be locked up.
Yeah. That is what's going to happen, apparently.
He is going to be locked up for a thousand years.
By God.
Yes.
Why for just a thousand years?
Why not forever?
See, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
It makes no fucking sense at all.
You have him, why would you let him go?
I don't know.
This shit!
It just seems so pieced together.
Did anyone think it through?
Wait. Why couldn't we do this?
Do what? Lock him up?
Sure.
How?
Okay, well, do you remember how
Buster was a total escape artist, and my dad had to build him that completely escape-proof kennel?
Yeah.
Wouldn't he yell?
Fuck you!
You will suffer forever!
Even if he did, you know, nobody likes him, he's the Antichrist.
Who would help him?
That's true. That's true.
What if he got out, though?
We'd just have to be incredibly careful that he didn't.
Remember to always, always keep the Antichrist locked up.
Yeah.
Maybe over time we could turn him good.
How?
We could get him a little pet.
Oh.
Have you been chewing on my books?
You adorable little scamp.
I think after 50 years, he's not even going to be that bad.
Chocolate chip cookies, kids?
Thank you, Uncle Beast.
You hungry little motherfuckers.
Wait, Linds, no.
How are we going to do this?
What do you mean?
Think about it, I mean...
I'd have to get on to the property, right?
Past all the wraiths.
And the Beastly Guards.
Right. And the Beastly Guards kill everybody they see.
Everybody! We'd need someone who couldn't be killed.
And who can't be killed?
Excuse me, Mr. Murphy.
Hi.
We were wondering if we could just talk to you for a minute?
I'm just mowing my lawn here.
Right, and it looks great.
As always.
But, we were wondering...
Well, we actually need your help, sir.
What?
Yeah, see, you're really the only one who can help us, because you're dead.
Dead?
Who is dead?
Nobody.
He doesn't...
Aw!
I'm just mowing my lawn here.
Right, but we were wondering...
Just mowing my lawn here!
Dude, you're dead.
You're dead. Plus, you have no lawnmower. You're pushing nothing.
Mr. Murphy?
Okay?
I don't think it's helping.
You're dead, if anybody's dead...
Wait. Stay here.
I have an idea.
Hi.
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing?
Can I borrow the truck, Dad?
Yeah. What for?
To take Lindsey to The Beast's.
Yeah. She's going with him.
Ohhh!
Ben!
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so relieved.
I'm so relieved she is going to fuck him.
Yeah.
Good for her.
So, uh, what's all this?
Oh.
The thing is, he's demanding a dowry.
A dowry?
Yeah, isn't that weird?
Yeah, well, it's old-fashioned for sure.
Uh... But nice in a way.
Exactly.
Hey, Ben?
Yeah?
So, you're going to give him the mower?
Well...
What do you get the guy who has everything?
Yeah.
What's really going on here?
Nothing. Like, I mean...
The dowry.
Yeah, I don't believe you.
We are going to fight him.
Oh, God! Ben!
Don't be ridiculous!
No, listen. We have a plan.
Aw...
Aw! Aw! You have a plan!
What is it?
We are going to lock him in a kennel.
You can do that. You can keep him prisoner for a thousand years.
Aw!
I didn't know.
I didn't know that you could lock the Antichrist in a fucking kennel for a thousand years!
You dumb, empty, retarded, mongoloid, idiot child!
What if it doesn't work? Huh?
Do you have a backup plan?
It won't work.
You don't have a backup plan!
I don't need one.
Stupid!
I can't let you do this, Ben.
You are going to have to.
I'm going to have to, huh?
Yeah.
Put down the shovel, Ben.
Are you going to hit me with a rake now?
Come on. Put it down.
He got really freaked out after you left and just started doing that.
Mr. Murphy, sir.
No. Not talking to you.
Can I show you something?
Nope.
I think you will like it.
Nope, nope, nope.
Fuck it.
Nope, nope, nope.
He smells really bad.
Do you like it?
It's yours if you want it.
All you have to do is keep mowing.
Oh. Nah.
Unnecessary.
Oh, he's super gross.
He's really gross.
This was our plan.
Number one,
Clark and Fry help Ben get past the wraiths with their pot.
Number two,
I use The Beast's obsession with my lady bits to distract and drug him.
Ow!
Number three, get our zombie neighbor to draw away the guards.
And number four, bring the drugged out Beast back and lock him up in Buster's kennel.
Good plan.
Almost nothing can go wrong.
Oh, my God!
You look so slutty.
Thanks.
Wow. Okay.
Um...
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Well...
What else are we going to do, Ben?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Are we sure this is a good plan?
Yeah. It is.
And it's the only one we have, besides me having sex with him, which is not going to be the plan.
No.
You know.
So, I'm going to take care of him and the guards.
All right.
I'll deal with the wraiths, and, um, we will use Mr.
Murphy to deal with the perimeter guards.
By 9:00, for sure.
Can you handle him for that long?
Oh, yeah. Totally.
He is so dumb, Ben.
Good.
Okay. We can do this.
Right?
Yeah, we can.
Right?
I love you.
I love you.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Okay.
Awesome.
I love you, Mom.
I love you too, honey.
Have fun.
Call or text if you're going to be really late.
Yeah.
So when do we leave,
Benjamin Franklin?
Five minutes.
If we run into a problem, here's what we do...
Let me guess. Knife him?
Yeah, totally.
Stab him in the fucking gut, right?
Or in the back of his neck.
Can't you guys fucking stop?
This is extremely important, and you are acting like morons.
Revelations tells us what's going to happen next.
Spoiler alert. Jesus is going to come down on a white horse and smite the Antichrist before God sets up his kingdom here on Earth.
Blow me!
Assholes! Rim job! Fucker!
Who is a sexy Beast?
I am a sexy Beast
Who is a sexy Beast?
I am a sexy Beast
Who is a sexy...
Turn the mirror.
I am a sexy Beast
Who is a sexy Beast?
I am a sexy...
Ooh! You a sexy Beast.
You a sexy Beast.
Yeah. You a sexy Beast.
You.
Is that a turn on, turn off?
That's a turn on, sir.
You like that?
Fuck yeah.
I'm going deep tonight.
I'm going deep tonight.
Oh, shit.
You want to do it?
Did that get you wet?
My pussy's so wet.
What?
I didn't say that.
I didn't say anything.
Wow.
Lindsey, you look...
Look at those titties.
So lovely.
Thank you.
Did you, uh...
Yup.
Trim bush!
Aw!
Sorry?
That was me getting an erection.
Oh.
That's nice.
Thank you.
Service it? No!
Now is the time for romance.
These are from him.
Carnations.
Thank you.
You have such good taste.
I know.
Lindsey, I cannot imagine a lovelier receptacle for my evil seed than you.
So much seed.
Just wait here for a second.
If you break his heart,
I'll be super pissed.
All right, let's go.
He will join you in the parlor.
Yup.
Welcome to where we are going to do it.
I want to touch your booty
All night long
I want to touch your booty
And stick my dick in you, girl
Stick my
Stick my dick in your
Stick my dick in your
Stick my dick in your yeah, booty
Hmm, stick my dick in your booty
That was so good.
That was something
I was working on for you.
Oh! Actually, I would love to pour this for you, sir.
Of course, my dear.
So, you like eggs?
I fucking love eggs.
They remind me of titties.
Good to know.
Chocolate eggs, Easter eggs.
Any type of eggs.
You put some eggs in that,
I am eating that shit.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
I love jelly beans, too.
But I hate Peeps.
I despise them.
I'm putting those assholes out of business. I promise.
Sure.
I fucking hate them.
Put them out of business.
Tomorrow, as a matter of fact.
Marshmallow ass chicken.
Feel the power of the fucking Beast.
Peepco.
I kick so much ass my feet need condoms.
So, how's the gay boyfriend taking all of this, my dear?
You know...
Badly. Like a bitch.
"Please don't leave me."
"No. I'm with The Beast now, tiny, little, tiny boy."
"But please, I love you."
"Get away from me with your chicken baby penis."
"Oh! Lindsey, please."
"I want Beast cock."
"Please." "Beast cock!"
"Please." "Beast cock!"
Something like that?
It was just like that.
What can I say?
I'm The Beast.
I know these things.
This is for you.
Thank you much.
I...
I feel so silly, this is so embarrassing.
What?
I was hoping that...
Yes?
Maybe we could get all the
Beastly Guards in here.
Freaky.
Anyway, and have them come in this room and propose a toast to me, please.
I thought you had a challenge.
Beastly Guards.
You will now come to me and join me in toasting your new queen.
This is Morgan on the PA system.
All Beastly Guards please report to the dining area.
I'm not drinking any of that shit.
- I tell you one thing.
- Noxzema...
Well, well, well.
The prodigal asshole returns.
Uh, I'm here to make a delivery to Walt House, the asshole.
Yeah, well, you are not on my list.
He promised me that I would have no problem getting this in.
Oh, God, that is so sad.
That's a sad story.
So, you're just going to be impossible about this.
We are. Get your vehicle, turn it around and get the fuck out of here.
All right. Fine.
Wait.
What's that smell?
What smell?
You know that smell?
What's happening, bros?
Do you want some?
No.
How much of this do you have?
I got a fucking pillow.
He's got a fucking pillow.
Come with me.
Leave the car running.
Come on.
Come on.
Come, Beastly Guards.
Get your fat asses in here.
Drink the nectar of eggs.
Toast your new queen.
Make sure everybody gets some.
Go, go, go.
To you, my dear.
God damn it!
I promised Little Beast
I would go say goodnight.
He will be crying all night if I don't.
Don't you want the drink, though?
It looks so good. I made it.
Don't worry.
We will fuck soon. Duty calls.
Get your fucking ass into bed, Little Beast!
No!
Don't be a dud, little fucker.
Kids.
Did I say anything that deserves that?
So much.
What a dud.
That's not a nice thing to say about your son.
Oh, my sweet, protective, mother hen.
He's still a dud, though.
He won't be like our children.
Here's a naughty idea.
Let's have sex on his bed right now.
Let's wait until after dinner.
Of course.
Okay.
I gotta take a poop anyway.
Oh!
This is going to be fantastic.
Aw!
That's excellent weed, guys.
Fuck!
Are you sure I can't make that delivery?
Really quick.
Hold on one second. I forgot.
What did you want to do?
You are so high.
I am.
What do you think?
Yes.
Yes?
No, I think that's a bad idea.
No, dude, don't be so fucking paranoid, man.
Am I being paranoid?
Yeah, what if it's a fucking great idea, man?
That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying it's a good idea.
Get out of here.
Yes. Do it. Just do it.
Okay.
Do it.
Do any other wraiths want to party, man?
You should call them up.
Let's go to highville.
Do you want to blow up something?
Let's blow up Helsinki.
Um.
Buenos Aires?
Listen, I want to blow up the whole world tonight.
How do you feel about that?
What?
Kind of.
Ooh. That is sexy.
It is sexy.
You're not the girl
I thought you were.
No.
You little vixen.
You gonna blow up the world with me?
Yeah, I'm going to do that tonight.
We are going to the bust the world up.
Hell, yeah.
I'm going to bust all over your face.
Uh-oh.
Was that too much?
Are you ready to cut some grass,
Mr. Murphy?
Yup.
Now remember, there is a lot that needs to be cut.
So don't stop until you get all of it.
No.
And don't let anybody stop you.
No.
You do know how to drive one of these things, right?
No.
- Hey, you!
- Shit!
Shit.
All right, just mow.
Ow!
Fuck.
Use your push mower.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, asshole!
What are you doing?
I will kill you with murder!
I'm just cutting the grass.
All right, take him out.
How do you like that?
Ow!
Go check him.
I'm just mowing the lawn here!
I'm mowing the lawn here!
I need everybody at gate two.
Right away!
Everybody at gate two!
I got some sort of undead, lawnmowing, dead, zombie motherfucker.
Stop your vehicle!
Oh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh.
What was that?
Did you guys hear that?
Dude,
I don't hear anything, man.
Yeah, dude, you are being paranoid.
Am I being paranoid?
Yeah.
Dude, turn the fucking music up.
Damn, this is good. Shit!
Nothing like a shrimp and mushroom omelet, am I right?
Um...
Where was I, my dear?
Your ex-wife.
God, I can't even believe I did that.
I was young and stupid and seduced by a natural blonde.
Do you know what I mean?
I think I do, yeah.
Her pubes were blonde.
My pubes are black.
As you will find out.
You know the secret to shrimp is to take out the dark line in the back.
That's their poo.
Three to four times a day.
That's why I'm so healthy.
Good. That's impressive.
I'm glad you told me.
Thank you.
Uh...
Do they have any more of that eggnog left? I'm so thirsty.
So, where do you want to go for our honeymoon?
Um...
Not that it matters, because you'll be getting face fucked the whole time, am I right?
Hey.
Let's stay here and just have intercourse.
And watch movies.
I love intercourse.
I love movies.
Are you a Vin Diesel fan?
I love Vin Diesel.
Fucking The Chronicles of Riddick, are you kidding me?
It's the best.
It's so underrated.
See. You see?
I do.
We are connected.
Right here with you.
Let's go make the beast with two backs.
Get it? The beast with two backs, because I'm The Beast and I got a back and you got a...
It's not that funny.
Come on, let's go.
Um, yeah, we could...
We should...
We should go to the Jacuzzi.
Jacuzzi?
Sounds sexy.
It's going to be.
What the shit?
Dude, what the fuck are they doing?
I think I saw them take some 'shrooms, bro.
What is going on with your hands?
We should fucking knife them.
Fucking knife them?
Yeah.
Fucking knife the shit out of them.
Stop your vehicle!
Oh, shit!
Ah!
If I was a dinosaur, guess what kind of dinosaur I'd be.
What?
A Lickalottapuss.
Do you get it?
That's so funny.
I do get it.
Because I would be licking your vagina all the time.
Ohhh.
What are you looking for, baby?
I'm right here.
Um...
Ben?
Are you calling your boyfriend?
Come on, Ben.
Baby!
I thought we had something.
This hurts.
I thought we had a moment.
Ben!
That's cool.
I didn't really like you that much.
Whatever.
Okay, Ben, seriously!
Ben!
Let her go, Antichrist!
This is who you are screaming for?
This Frodo-looking motherfucker?
He even walks gay!
I'm The Beast, baby!
Beastly Guards.
Most of them are chasing a dead guy on a lawnmower.
Okay, what does that mean?
Wraiths, come to me.
Fucking useless potheads.
Just let her go, man.
Or what?
Or I will kick your evil ass.
Baby.
That's...
That's a good one.
Hey, I got a good one, too.
How about you do like this to my booty-hole.
I'm warning you, Earl.
My name is Beast.
What are you going to do to me, anyway, huh? What, you going to kill me?
I'm going to lock you in a dog kennel.
I don't even know how to respond to that.
But you know what?
Seeing as how I have better things to do, like make it with your lady, how about I shoot you?
No!
God damn it.
Back off.
Give me that.
Fuck!
I killed Jimmy Neutron.
Baby.
Back up.
What?
What are you going to do, huh?
You don't want to shoot me.
Unless you want me to come back as Satan.
Don't push me. Okay, Earl?
I'm really sick of this crap.
And honestly, you in particular.
You are so lame.
I'm lame?
You're dating Peter Brady.
I've been letting you say this gross shit to me all night.
The fact that anybody is afraid of you is incredible.
If they knew what a child...
It doesn't matter,
I will shoot you.
I will totally shoot you.
Whatever.
That's for being an asshole.
Let's party, baby.
Fuck!
See you later, baby.
Oh, shit.
Oh! Baby.
Baby, wake up.
Are you okay?
Why do I keep getting hit in the head?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, baby. I shot him.
Hmm?
Baby, I killed him.
Where?
I'm serious. Right here.
Fuck. I am unstoppable!
Ow!
Now what do we do?
Just keep killing him.
Until what?
Maybe it will take at some point.
Baby, I'm going to need more guns.
Okay, I'm on it.
- That really hurts...
- Damn!
Ben?
Yeah.
Will you stop shooting...
Fuck you!
This can't be legal.
Ben?
Yeah.
I know what you're thinking.
Ow! Bitch!
Quick question.
I'm getting pretty good at this, baby.
I'm coming!
Motherfucker!
What are you going to do now, fool?
What time is it?
You don't seem like the type.
No.
No, that won't work either.
Go to bed, Little Beast.
Little fucker.
But I have an idea.
How does this go down?
I need a screwdriver or something.
What is that?
It's coming right at us!
Ben, wait!
Ben, wait!
Oh, no!
Oh, no.
This is so bad, baby.
I didn't know, Linds.
I thought it was a rock. Fuck.
This is incredibly bad, Ben!
Okay, okay.
Can we do CPR? Maybe?
You laser-beamed him, baby!
I don't think CPR is going to work.
I can't believe I did this.
Aw!
How could I have been so fucking stupid?
I feel really sick, Ben.
My dad's right!
I'm a fucking idiot!
Is that...
What?
Is that him?
Idiots!
What have you done?
Um...
Okay.
Well.
Yeah.
Answer me!
We sort of killed the Antichrist at first.
We did.
It was not nearly as hard as you might think.
Right. Yeah. We just shot him with a regular gun, and then Ben was hitting him with a shovel.
Just bonked him.
That was it.
You barbecued my son.
I...
I saw this thing coming from the sky,
I had no idea what it was.
It could have been bad.
He didn't know.
It could have been bad.
I panicked...
And I...
Yeah. I laser-beamed him.
I beamed Jesus. I'm so sorry.
It was a total accident, though.
Yeah, total.
Do you two have any idea what you have done here?
Um...
Well...
No.
There was a plan.
A rather detailed and specific plan involving the final chapter of all human existence!
Do you understand that that plan is completely ruined?
We didn't mean to.
We are so just incredibly sorry, sir.
It was a gaffe.
Ugh!
It was a mistake.
It's all I needed to hear.
You're sorry.
I forgive you.
It's kind of what I do.
It's all good.
We will just start over.
It's no big deal.
It's not like I spent a lot of time on this.
Only 4,000 fucking years!
You proud of yourselves?
You pathetic little shits.
Fuck you, dude!
Don't, no.
You don't have to be so mean.
I'm sorry, but you don't have to be so mean.
What did you say, whore?
You heard me, man. I said,
"Fuck you." You are being a dick.
Not to God.
You're a dick!
You're like a bug to me!
You made her.
Yeah. Good call, baby.
"You made her, so..."
He doesn't talk like that.
I'm not Southern.
You talk exactly like that, Ben!
That is how I made you!
He doesn't have a pinched nose.
What is that?
You sound exactly like that.
No, I don't.
Give me that sweater.
Don't do it.
Just give me the fucking sweater!
Because I'm fucking God.
Give it to me.
Don't do it, baby.
Do it!
Don't, he has a jacket.
Don't.
I want a sweater!
God, wait.
Look behind you.
You actually expect me to fall for that trick?
No, no, it's not a trick.
"It's not a trick."
You're so stupid.
Argh!
Oh! Earl!
What the fuck, man!
That's right, big boy!
This isn't about you, Earl.
Okay?
Oh, it's all about me.
And my official name is Satan.
So, none of this
"Earl" bullshit.
Okay, let me smite these fuckers down and then we can talk.
All right?
Do you think I want to talk?
No, no, no.
All I want to do is kick your candy ass.
What the fuck did you say?
You want to go,
Fat Prince?
Let's do it.
Thou shalt whoop your ass!
It's on.
Ow!
Come on, bitch.
That's all you got?
You want some? Happy Meal?
Happy Meal...
You like that?
Whoo-hoo!
Bitch.
Time-out?
No, you're fresh out of time-outs, bitch.
Who are we rooting for?
They both want to kill us.
Right.
Revelations, bitch!
It is a pretty unusual thing to be watching, when you think about it.
Yeah!
You win.
Ow!
Get the fuck off me, Tattoo!
Who the fuck do you think you're fucking with? Abraham?
I am the Lord!
Ow!
Suffer!
Not me, you little fucker!
I'm gonna fuck your shit up!
Come on, Confucius.
I'm gonna bottle you, motherfucker.
I'm gonna fuck you up.
Argh!
Fuck you, Earl!
Almighty, my ass!
You are a terrible father!
You are one to talk.
Touche!
Earl...
My name is Satan!
I had enough of this shit!
Shit!
Wow.
I definitely didn't think that was possible. Right?
You would have thought that God would have seen that coming.
Yeah. Maybe he did?
His plan was to get electrocuted in a Jacuzzi?
Most of it didn't make a lot of sense to me, so it's possible.
They shot at me!
You fucking idiots!
I should spank you both!
Wow! You did it!
You killed him.
I knew you could do it.
No, you didn't.
You just had to apply yourself, Benjamin.
That's all.
You're not a loser anymore!
Good for you.
And who's that right there?
Is that...
Yeah.
He's tiny, huh?
So...
Wow.
I mean, huh, right?
A lot of questions.
There he is!
Dead zombie motherfucker.
Stop that fucking lawnmower!
Stop it!
What the fuck?
You killed him?
Oh, thank God.
It's over.
Right.
We did it! We killed him!
No more beatings.
No more rapings.
I guess that means
I'm in charge.
I wouldn't take that leap.
That's a big leap.
I'm the leader of the world.
Bow down before me!
No.
What? No.
How come all of a sudden you're in charge?
There's as much reason for me to be in charge as for you.
You? Fuck, no!
He thought you were the pool guy.
He used to rape you.
You have a massive head wound.
That is a brain injury.
So what?
You look like a jerk.
You guys. Um...
Look at your mustache.
Most world rulers look like jerks.
Who cares? What?
You guys, um...
Um, I just feel like, probably, nobody is in charge.
Or, well...
Everybody's in charge.
Everybody's in charge.
So, it's a good thing.
Uh...
We're all in charge.
We can be grown-ups.
Everybody okay with that?
Yeah.
You are definitely not in charge, though.
So what do we do now?
Just live.
That's what we're gonna do.
Right?
That's deep, baby.
Yeah.
Just live.
Let's go make out.
All right.
You kids be safe.
We're gonna live.
Yeah. I might, uh...
I might go back to school.
Yeah!
Yeah.
I never went to college.
I know. I know.
It's over.
Okay!
It's so nice to be held.
Okay. Okay.
Oh, you're so strong.
Okay.
I like those big arms.
Don't make this into something it's not. Okay?
Huh?
Don't make this into something it's not.
You didn't feel anything there?
No. Let's just live.
Live our lives.
Right.
All right.
Okay.
I thought with the mustache and everything, you...
No.
No.
You're sending a real message there.
No.
"Put a dick in here."
Ohhh.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Hmm.
Life goes on, man.
Ohhh!
Life goes on.
After that night, things went back to normal.
Good Sandwiches went from a smashed lunch cart to a popular lunch destination.
Overall, I'd have to say the future looks really, really bright.
Okay, that sounded really corny, but...
Whatever. I killed God and the Antichrist, man.
I'll do whatever I want.
The rocks stopped falling out of the sky.
The wraiths were still around, but Mom made some new friends and calmed down a little bit.
If you guys are hungry later,
I made an amazing pot of beans last night.
It's, um... They've been hanging out in a Crock-Pot for almost 12 hours at a low setting, and I'll tell you what,
I soaked those guys overnight, and, uh...
It's better than the quick soak.
Some things didn't go back like before.
Like Mr. Murphy.
Still dead... Undead.
But Ben and I stole his lawnmower back for him.
He loves it. Doesn't seem to notice we broke the motor, either.
This used to be the Devil's mansion!
It's ours now!
Ben's dad now lives at The Beast's mansion.
I'm not sure that he should, but who's gonna kick him out?
I put PCP in the salsa!
This is gonna get fucking crazy!
Fucking crazy!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey!
Let's go to Mexico!
GRANDMOTHER: ...her hair as red as the setting sun.
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!
Hey, look who's up.
Hey. What are we doing here, Nathan?
NATHAN: Uh, I think I took a wrong turn a couple miles ago.
I'm just trying to get a signal on the phone for the GPS, but, uh, nothing.
I know the way from here.
We should get going.
Okay, sure.
Whatever.
You had a good sleep?
Yeah, thank you for driving.
Hey, look at that.
Keswick.
Sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing you.
Just call Agent Walker, okay?
He's handling my caseload while I'm away. Thank you.
I thought you were gonna turn that thing off.
It's off. It's off.
Look, I promise, this weekend is all about me meeting your family.
No work, no phone.
No gun.
I don't think my family is gonna be that intimidating.
NATHAN:
Promises, promises.
Wow. This place is in the middle of nowhere.
VIRGINIA: A perfect place for us to forget about our jobs.
NATHAN: Don't worry, my phone doesn't wanna work up here anyway.
Wow. Now, that is a house.
I didn't know
I was marrying into money.
Don't get any ideas. The house has been in the family for generations.
It's amazing.
GRANDMA: Welcome home, Virginia.
Ha-ha-ha.
You're too skinny.
You say that every time
I've been away.
It's true.
JAKE: Hey, you're here.
Jake. Look at you.
Ha-ha-ha.
JAKE:
Welcome home, Red.
Where's Marcus?
GRANDMA: Uh...
At work.
He'll be home tonight.
You guys,
I want you to meet Nathan.
A pleasure to meet you.
Hey, you must be Jake.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Jake will help you get your bag, show you to your room.
Get you settled. Uh, I don't mean to be an ungracious hostess, but I would like to spend some private time with my granddaughter.
NATHAN:
Understood.
So you're the guy that's, uh, banging my sister, huh?
If you knew anything about your sister, you'd know it's the other way around.
I heard you call her "Red."
Everybody in the family call her that?
Yeah. It's a name of honor given to the first-born daughter in each generation of our family.
So it's not because of the red hair?
Heh. No.
Well, what does it mean?
Uh...
Uh, you'll have to ask Virginia.
It feels good to be home.
So nice to have you here.
Everyone sleeping under the same roof again, if only for a little while.
How's that, uh, job?
Keeping my skills sharp.
Any activity within the den?
No, they're behaving quietly, adhering to the truce.
That's good.
I need to talk to you about something.
I wanted to wait until we were face-to-face.
I wanna tell Nathan about our family history.
What we do is difficult for people who were not born into it.
Just as difficult on those who are.
It's a lot to trust to someone.
I've never brought anyone home to meet you before.
It's important to me that he knows me.
All of me.
I don't wanna have to lie to him for the rest of my life.
It'll have to be a family decision.
Of course.
Virginia, are you sure he's the one?
Well, I'm so glad that we finally get to meet you.
I was starting to think you guys didn't actually exist.
I'd like to see my granddaughter more often.
She just doesn't want you to know what we really do out here.
Remember, you're talking to two federal agents.
Ooh.
So how did you two meet?
Um, actually, we met at the academy.
NATHAN: Yeah.
I, uh... I was, I guess, sort of top dog for a little while and your granddaughter showed up and kicked my butt.
No, I did not.
NATHAN: Yes, you did, Virginia.
That reminds me, um, why do you guys call her "Red"?
Yeah, why is that?
Nathan, why do you want to marry my granddaughter?
Well, let's not embarrass him.
Oh, no, that's okay. That's okay.
Um...
Well, I, uh...
Well, I guess she challenges me.
You like challenge?
I do.
Dude, you have no idea.
Okay, I think we should unpack before dinner.
Um, I just have to run out to the car quickly for something. Thank you.
Play nice.
Nathan, you better not be on the phone!
You have to keep your mouth shut.
Whoa. Here we go.
Wow. Reception here really stinks.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.
Ga... Ga...
Gabriel.
What? What?
Hey. Hey! Hey!
I'll go get help.
Stay with me.
I'll be right back.
Help!
Somebody call the police!
Hurry up!
VIRGINIA: Nathan, what's wrong?
NATHAN:
I don't understand.
What the hell happened?
GRANDMA: It's Xavier.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
You know who this is?
GRANDMA: Yes.
Did he say anything to you before you left him?
He said a name.
Gabriel.
Am I the only one bothered that I was talking to this guy five minutes ago and now, he's basically incinerated?
It is physically impossible for a human body to burn this fast.
Finally.
Sheriff.
Agent Keswick, FBI. What...?
That's him?
Yes, Marcus. This is Nathan.
Am I missing something here?
JAKE:
This is our brother Marcus.
Jake, get a shovel and a bag out of the truck.
Let's move this stuff before anyone sees.
NATHAN: Whoa, whoa
. There's protocol here.
We gotta get the medical examiner to check this out first.
Virginia, you brought him here, you deal with him.
I am gonna have to tell him.
We've been left with no choice.
Tell me what? Virginia, what the hell is going on here?
I need to show you something.
We have a problem.
Yes, we do.
I need you to keep an open mind.
My family is not only involved in law enforcement, we are also hunters, of a sort.
Okay, so you hunt.
What does that have to do with the dead guy?
It's what we hunt.
Okay, what am I looking at?
VIRGINIA:
It's what we hunt.
NATHAN:
But... But these are...
Werewolves.
Oh, come on.
Give me a break.
JAKE:
What's going on?
Nathan.
I just need some time.
Nathan. Nathan.
Whoa, whoa. Virginia, let him go.
Whoever killed Xavier is out there.
Hey, hey, hey.
He's a big boy, he can take care of himself, right?
It's not a full moon tonight, he's gonna be fine.
Go. Come on inside.
Come on inside.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Go.
Oh, come on.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
This is Agent Nathan Keswick.
Can you hear anything I'm saying?
Argh...
Son of a bitch.
Anybody there?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Somebody here?
MAN:
Are you lost?
Who the hell are you and what are you doing out here?
MAN: I was just out here taking a stroll.
NATHAN:
A stroll? In the rain?
I prefer to be out here in nature.
NATHAN:
Well, it's not safe.
There's a killer on the loose.
MAN: Ooh. What kind of killer would that be?
I'm not sure.
Some kind of animal.
Could it have been a wolf?
What kind of wolf would rip a man apart?
Something like this.
My name is Gabriel.
MARCUS:
You going somewhere?
Nathan's been gone too long.
We need to go after him.
With Xavier dead, I've got more important things to worry about.
Fine, I'll go alone.
I'll send Jake.
That's impossible.
It's not a werewolf.
It's not a full moon.
VIRGINIA: I'll go ahead.
Jake, come on.
Let's go.
JAKE:
Nathan!
Nathan!
Nathan!
VIRGINIA: Nathan!
Nathan, where are you?
JAKE: Nathan!
VIRGINIA: Nathan!
Nathan, answer me!
Nathan?
Nathan!
JAKE: Red, wait.
Nathan. Nathan, are you all right?
Nathan, get up. Get up.
Get up. Are you hurt? Nathan.
Unh.
Answer me.
Are you hurt?
Everything you said was true.
There was a werewolf.
Yeah.
We followed his trail directly to you.
You're lucky to be alive.
He said his name was Gabriel.
I watched him turn.
How did you get away from him?
I don't think I did.
VIRGINIA: Did he bite you?
No, I don't think so.
I'm sorry. I have to be sure you weren't bitten.
NATHAN:
If I was?
You'll turn into a werewolf and then I'll have to kill you.
VIRGINIA:
You're bleeding.
What?
Did he bite me?
No.
No, you're okay.
He's okay.
He just hit his head.
I'll radio Marcus, tell him we found Nathan, and meet you back at the house.
I'm gonna see if I can track this thing.
Be careful.
We're dealing with something we've never seen before.
Here, let's go.
Okay.
Come on.
Slow. Slow.
One, two, three.
Unh. Aah.
Okay. Okay. I'm okay.
VIRGINIA: All right. You're okay.
NATHAN: I'm okay.
VIRGINIA: Just take it slow.
Come on.
What's wrong?
Hold on. Let me just...
Okay. Are you okay?
Stay right here.
I was looking for you.
What happened?
Nathan had a run-in with a werewolf that can phase at will.
Is he okay?
GRANDMA: Is he bitten?
No. No, thank God.
Okay, let's get him in here.
The wolf's name was Gabriel.
That must be the wolf that killed Xavier.
Okay, did he have any special markings?
Did he have any markings?
I just watched a man turn into a werewolf.
That may be a common-day occurrence for you people, but not for me.
What the hell's going on here, Virginia?
The dead man at the end of the driveway, he was the leader of one of the last wolf packs.
Our family had a truce with him.
As long as they stayed in the deep woods, kept themselves locked away during the full moon cycle, we agreed not to hunt them.
Okay, Nathan, what did he look like in human form?
I don't know. He's, um, middle-aged, 6 foot...
We're not dragging him into this.
He is in this. You brought him into it.
We have a dead pack leader and a wolf who can phase at will.
He can help me.
I won't allow it.
You wanna marry this guy?
Want him to understand what you do?
He needs to see if he can stomach it.
Jake is tracking the werewolf.
We can find it without putting Nathan in danger.
Let the man make up his own mind.
NATHAN: Look, the only thing that I wanna make my mind up about is going upstairs and getting some sleep.
This is all insane.
I'm impressed he survived a werewolf on the first encounter.
Few people do that.
I don't know. Maybe he is cutout to be part of this family.
Or maybe somebody wanted him to survive.
MARCUS: Where's Nathan?
VIRGINIA: Still in bed. Exhausted.
East perimeter's clear.
I think we should...
MAN: Marcus!
Virginia! I'm okay.
Heh-heh-heh.
JAKE: Hey. It took all night, but I tracked that wolf to just outside
Tanner's River before I lost it.
That town is outside the designated territory.
You think the clan's about to go rogue?
It's possible.
If even one of them set foot inside the town, that's a clear violation of the truce.
So? We going hunting?
We are.
All right.
Hey.
That thing I saw last night, how do we kill it?
VIRGINIA: There's only one way to kill a werewolf.
A silver weapon through the heart, bullet or blade, doesn't matter.
It's an involuntary transformation triggered by the full moon.
It ends at dawn.
This Gabriel seems like a different kind of animal.
You get bitten by a werewolf, you will turn into one on the next full moon.
The effects can be reversed, but only if you kill the wolf that bit you and only if you do it before you make your first human kill.
You kill a human, you're cursed for as long as you live.
So, basically, don't get bitten.
No. Once you're bitten, you're never the same.
It's like a disease or a drug addiction you can't kick.
The wolf is always a part of you.
You ever turn one back?
A werewolf, I mean.
Grandmother did.
Once.
Who was it?
Our grandfather.
That's our family's dirty little secret.
If we're hunting during the day, how do we know they're not wolves?
MARCUS: They may not look like wolves, but they are.
NATHAN: How do we make sure we don't kill a human?
Werewolf test.
It's a pellet filled with silver halide paint.
Burns the flesh, marks them, and causes a mild transformation.
Mild transformation?
What does that mean?
You'll see.
Okay. Okay. All right.
VIRGINIA: Tanner's River is the edge of their territory.
MARCUS: Anyone from the pack caught within the town is fair game.
JAKE:
And "fair game" means dead.
What the hell happened here?
It was before the truce.
Over the course of three nights, practically everyone was turned.
Our family had no choice.
They had to be put down.
An entire town?
That's why it's so important that we never let them out of their territory.
Never let them get close to the rest of civilization.
Truce or no truce, we should have wiped them all out a long time ago.
Go. Go, go, go.
Looks like we got a couple of rogues.
MARCUS:
Shooter in position?
Affirmative.
Nathan, you see your wolf from last night, you let us know.
Virginia!
I love this.
GABRIEL:
Nathan.
JAKE:
What are you doing?
You all right?
Yeah, thanks to Nathan.
You okay?
I'm good, yeah.
Is this your wolf?
No.
Please, don't hurt me!
Grab her.
JAKE: Come on. Come on. Okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
You're safe now.
Did they hurt you?
No.
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.
Just tell us what happened.
I was running out of gas, and I pulled off the highway and it said there was a gas station, but there wasn't.
There was just dead end.
And that's where they put me.
You and Virginia take her to the hospital.
Tell them I'll be by to file a report.
Virginia will know what to say.
Okay. Where are you gonna go?
Jake and I will make sure there's nothing else.
Jake! Let's go.
NATHAN:
Is she okay?
Are you sure they didn't hurt you?
They said they were gonna use me in their next game.
What game?
WOMAN:
I don't know.
But from what they were saying, once you go into the game, you never come back.
Come on.
Come on.
Your ancestors were strong.
Their blood is in your veins.
They were unstoppable.
Your ancestors roamed free on this earth.
But now the hunters define us.
They've driven us to this rotten little patch.
They say we're ruled by the moon!
I say it's all a lie!
We can change at will.
Well, no one here but us humans.
So it would seem.
Do you see the way they look at you?
You should have killed Xavier much sooner.
To survive, we must evolve.
NATHAN:
Hey.
You okay?
Thank you.
For what?
For keeping our secret.
Not saying anything to that girl's parents at the hospital.
Well, it's all about family, right?
I'm not sure my family has been the best thing for you.
Is there a reason that you never talk about your parents?
I didn't really know them.
I was so young when they died.
How did they die?
Killed by a werewolf.
I'm sorry.
What's bothering you?
Nothing, I'm fine.
I...
I liked killing that werewolf today.
I enjoyed it.
I felt no sense of remorse whatsoever.
Made me feel powerful.
Is that wrong?
No.
Tonight, you will learn what it's like to be like us.
To live in a primal state.
If you will it, you will survive.
Set them free. Let the game begin.
WOMAN: No.
I want you to turn me.
I don't wanna die.
I wanna live.
I wanna be like you.
Come on.
Let's move.
Come on.
Move it.
Just relax now.
I'll end this quickly for you.
Don't move, don't move!
Stay calm.
MAN: Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
MARCUS: Stay calm.
MAN: Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.
VIRGINIA: It's okay.
It's okay. Believe me.
You're safe with us.
MAN:
No, we have to go.
The wolves, they're coming.
They're coming.
It's okay, we've been hearing things about a game.
Is this it, the game?
They hunt humans?
Yes.
How did you know that wolf was there?
Instinct, I guess.
Okay, there's no record of any wolf being able to transform at will.
Nothing.
So, what, this Gabriel is some kind of new breed?
Being able to transform at will, it changes everything.
Especially if he's teaching the rest of his pack to do the same.
The guy at the farmhouse, he's been with them for weeks.
He said this wolf is also telepathic or something.
He said that Gabriel can somehow communicate with those he's turned.
Is that even possible?
I don't know, Red.
I'm seeing things that I never thought I'd see in my lifetime.
We have to wipe them out now, every last one of them.
No more excuses, no more truce, no more mercy.
You guys go upstairs, get some rest.
In the morning, we start at Tanner's River, work our way to the farmhouse, see if we can pick up their trail.
Gran.
Something about Nathan that bothers me.
What?
I don't know, it's just a feeling I get.
Keep an eye on him.
JAKE:
Still clear.
VIRGINIA:
Nothing up here to report.
I can't see anything out here either.
We've been looking all day, we must have missed something.
VIRGINIA: We should lock up here for the night.
Maybe wait till after the full moon.
Check that.
NATHAN: Trip wire is gonna keep those things out?
MARCUS:
It'll buy us some time.
JAKE: The full moon should bring them out.
MARCUS:
I'm looking forward to it.
MARCUS: Jake, make sure the perimeter is tight.
There can't be gaps.
JAKE:
Yeah, okay.
MARCUS: Virginia will have eyes both directions.
We can tie to this tree over here.
MARCUS: All right, hang on a second.
I just gotta finish this.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan?
Nathan?
MARCUS: Do you need that?
Shh. Wait a second.
MARCUS: Virginia, move!
Don't kill him!
JAKE:
Hit him before he moves!
You put us all in danger.
We need to lock him up.
What happened?
You've been infected, Nathan.
Last night, you turned into a werewolf.
Did I hurt anyone?
No. No. Thank God.
How did this happen?
Gabriel must have bitten you.
I should have looked more closely.
You said...
You said that if
I turned into a werewolf, you were gonna have to kill me.
Wait here.
I'll get you some clothes.
You should have let me kill him.
Not everything is black and white.
It is to me.
That's your problem. If you could see anything outside of being a hunter...
I don't wanna see anything outside of being a hunter.
This is what I am. I'm good at it.
I like being good at it.
Your narrow view of the world is a liability.
No, I'm not the bad guy here.
You're the one who's wrong.
Flat-out wrong.
First responsibility is always to protect this family.
Always. You shouldn't have brought him here.
Nathan is family, as far as I'm concerned.
Forgive me for wanting to have some sort of life outside of being a hunter.
Marcus, if it had been
Jake, Virginia or me, would you have been able to kill so easily?
We all make mistakes, Marcus. No one got hurt, that's the important thing.
It is time to forgive and move on.
We have to stick together, now more than ever before.
We know who infected him, right?
He hasn't killed anyone.
We can turn him back. We gotta hunt Gabriel anyway, right?
It's not that simple, Jake.
There's repercussions.
They're manageable.
It's not gonna turn out well for you and him.
That'll be my problem to deal with, after we turn him back, not yours.
I got him into this,
I'm gonna get him out, with or without your help, Marcus.
MARCUS: I'll help.
I'll help.
Only because I wanna hunt that son of a bitch down and kill him myself.
For the record, if that does happen to me,
I would want one of you to kill me rather than let me live like that.
I'll make a note of it for future reference.
That's it.
You can do it.
Yes, you can.
There is a beast in all of us just waiting to be summoned.
Feel it coursing through your veins.
You've got to give in to it.
Get rid of that painful human side.
Unh. It's just too hard.
Really?
Perhaps you should lie down.
Take a nap.
I'd like that.
GABRIEL:
Sleep tight.
So... shall we try again?
You know, it's an amazing feeling when you are in the throes of transformation.
It is such joy.
Such ecstasy.
And to think that you can have that sensation whenever you want it.
That's what you desire.
That's what you thirst for.
Now, let that desire drive you.
MAN:
It's happening.
GABRIEL:
Well done.
Well, if he can do it, who's next?
Hey!
How's he doing?
Nathan?
He's strong.
He's a good man.
Yeah. He is.
Any activity?
Uh, it's all quiet.
I plotted out their movements over the last three days.
Given what the guy at the farmhouse said, they must still be hiding out in Tanner's River.
I wish he could have given us more information.
He was hysterical. Whole thing must have been like a bad dream.
Oh, this is a bad dream.
Do you agree with Marcus?
About Nathan?
I...
I don't know, Red.
I just want all this to be over.
NATHAN:
Hey.
So is it time?
MARCUS: It is.
The wolf stays here.
The license plates. We should have noticed before.
Noticed what?
They're all out of state.
They've been luring people off the highway for quite a while.
Go. Go. Go.
One, two, three.
There's gotta be a way in.
Where can they be?
Shh. Shh, shh.
JAKE:
We've been here. It's clear.
VIRGINIA:
Got something here.
Looks like someone's been busy.
This should make you sleep right through it.
It's for the best, believe me.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you for being so concerned with my safety.
Oh, it's not for your safety, it's for my own.
Hm.
Is it true? That you were able to turn your husband back after he'd been infected?
It's true.
Was it the right choice?
That's a difficult question,
Nathan.
Please.
I would really like to know the answer.
He liked being a wolf.
He resented that I took the choice away from him.
On more than one occasion, I found him trying to turn himself back.
Eventually, he did, and so I had to kill him.
I'm sorry for what happened to you.
I know that you are a victim in all of this.
But I will not let my granddaughter go through what I had to.
Not if I can help it.
Okay, you and Jake head down that way, I'll go down here.
Splitting up is not a good idea.
We've gotta make sure none of them get past us. I'll be fine.
What is this?
Welcome. I've been looking forward to this.
Get some rest.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan!
Gabriel, I presume?
After I've had a bad dream,
I find it's helpful to get a good stretch.
Where are my brothers?
Well, worrying about their future, I hope.
Our newbies are eager to make their first kill.
And me?
I intend to kill you myself.
The last female warrior of the hunter bloodline.
You're a monster.
You and all your kind.
Now... we're the perfect match.
Mm.
I am gonna kill you, Gabriel.
Once upon a time,
I would have run.
Jake.
Jake!
Come on, Jake!
Hunters, we honor you.
For our newcomers, you will be their first kills.
You will give them the opportunity to show what they're made of.
The chance to become permanent members of the clan.
Set them free.
Jake. Jake, we've gotta stick together!
Always.
MARCUS:
Jake!
MARCUS: Let's go. Come on.
Come on, Jake.
We gotta find someplace to make a stand.
We're never gonna outrun them.
Find a weapon or something.
Aw, shoot Marcus
They never checked my boots.
Our odds of survival just improved dramatically. Let's go.
Come on, Jake.
Come on. Come on.
Drop back.
I'll pull them to bridges.
Come on!
Come on.
Come on.
JAKE:
Where'd they go?
Jake!
Where'd they go?
I don't know. Jake.
Go back...
Go back to town and get Virginia.
Get Virginia, Jake.
What about you?
I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
I just...
I'm gonna find them.
Okay, go. Go, go, go!
You sure?
Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf?
Well, we got rid of some of the weaker ones.
Did you expect them to kill this many?
No.
I did not.
Lyra!
Where's my sister?
Done.
They're not back yet.
Something must be wrong.
I'm going after them.
I'll come with you.
No.
You'll only slow me down.
Oh, man.
They'll pay for this.
I promise you.
GABRIEL: Don't fool yourself, Nathan.
You're with us now.
Look deep inside yourself,
Nathan. You know it's true.
You wanna be a wolf.
GABRIEL:
Nathan.
Their death was inevitable.
Yours doesn't have to be.
Welcome.
Don't be afraid.
It's just me, in your head.
Oh, yeah? Well, then come out and face me.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan! Nathan!
GABRIEL:
If you kill me, you'll change back.
Think of what I've given you.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan!
Nathan!
Nathan.
Nathan!
NATHAN: Virginia. Oh.
Virginia, are you okay?
Just get me down.
Okay.
Just get me down.
Where are my brothers?
Gotta get you down.
Nathan, where are my brothers?
We don't have time for this.
No. No.
GABRIEL: Should you choose to remain with her, she will kill you.
That is, of course, unless you turn her.
You could have it all, Nathan.
Turn her and it's all yours.
Tonight, I will be coming for her.
When I was a little girl, all I wanted was to grow up so I could hunt.
Carry on the family tradition.
It seemed so grand, so exciting.
It made us special.
The secret we couldn't share.
Knowing something about the world no one else did.
It was magical.
I felt the same way.
We all did.
Now it's all come down to you.
You mustn't let a single one of them live.
I don't plan to.
Here, wear these.
We don't want you touching any silver.
Okay.
Okay, I'm gonna head back down, all right?
VIRGINIA:
Hey.
You forgot these.
Got it.
Okay, I think that's the last of the guns.
And all fully loaded with silver.
Good.
Then we're ready.
I think we're running out of time.
I'm gonna end this tonight.
Yeah.
I think we better get me in my cage.
I can feel it starting.
I'm gonna make this right.
Virginia, it's time.
You go,
I'll put him in his cage.
GABRIEL:
Hello, Virginia.
You gotta try a bit harder, Virginia.
Aren't you the slippery one?
Too bad about your brothers,
Virginia.
I wish I could tell you they died well.
But in the end,
I find all pure humans are cowards.
You missed the heart.
No!
I'm so sorry, Nathan.
I told you I'd kill you, Gabriel.
You'll never kill all of us.
No.
Nathan.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan?
Nathan?
Nathan?
Nathan!
Nathan?
VIRGINIA:
Nathan.
You're bleeding.
It's okay, it's not my blood.
Gabriel's dead.
I think the rest of the pack too.
Good. That means it's just me, then.
It wasn't supposed to end this way.
It doesn't have to end.
I wanna have a life with you, Virginia.
That would be nice.
Well, you just lock me away for the full moon.
That doesn't work.
Virginia, you've been bitten.
Hey, this gives us a choice now.
We can do this. It doesn't have to end this way.
I was so stupid.
I wanted a normal life.
I wanted everything my family fought to protect.
I'm sorry I ever brought you here.
Hey, I'm not sorry.
I'm not sorry.
Okay, we can do this.
Trust me, everything's gonna be okay.
I promise I will find a way to control the change.
Okay?
I love you, Nathan.
I always will.
"Her parents warned her not to venture beyond the edge of their village, for within the forest lived an unspeakable evil.
An evil so powerful, the elders only dared to speak of it in whispers."
It was my fault.
I was the one driving when it happened.
After the accident, I started seeing things, things that couldn't be real.
But I'm not crazy.
I know.
Your father knows.
Anyone who knows you knows that.
Look, Max, I've seen you every day for the past two months.
Maybe you're starting to let go of your misplaced guilt.
Maybe you're ready to stop blaming yourself for what happened.
But there's no one else to blame.
It's gotten to the point where I look in the mirror...
and I'm not even sure what's real anymore.
Fancy mirror.
Later.
You're a lady-killer, Schow.
Lady-killer.
What's goin' on?
Hey! What-
No!
Yeah.
Max.
- Who's this?
- Are you still sleeping? What time is it?
- Dad? Is that you?
- Of course it's me.
Yeah. Is everything all right?
Yeah. Did I wake you up?
You don't sound good.
- I'm fine. I'm just getting some sleep.
- Thank you.
Careful over there.
Just getting to the point where I can sleep through the night again.
Good, good.
You gotta get your rest.
- Keller.
- Yeah?
- Five minutes.
- Okay, that's great.
That is the Mayflower signature right there.
That glass has been through so much.
You can see the care that went into making it.
Even the base came from the original store.
So that gives us the- its spirit.
I think it's perfect.
Look, Max, for the last two months the police have been all over us...
Iooking for that missing girl.
Max, we may not be able to open on time.
Really? I didn't know that, Dad.
And then last week our night security guard goes crazy.
He cuts himself up bad and he quits.
Max, I've got weeks of work to do and two weeks out from opening.
The last thing I need to be doing... is looking for a new night watchman.
I'm just not sure I'm ready yet, Dad, after all that's happened this year and-
Max. This is what you need.
And, honestly, right now I need you, Max.
I know it'll help you take your mind off things.
- Yeah.
- Look.
- I think it's gonna be good.
- All right, Dad. I'll do it.
Thanks for the opportunity.
No, no, no, thank you, Max.
I tell you what.
Why don't you come in to work a little early and find me...
so that we can say hello before you clock in. Okay?
- Yeah. Sure. I'll come find you.
- All right.
- We'll see you in a little bit.
- Okay, Dad.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Shoot.
I got it.
Just trying to help.
That may or may not be the case... but you should put that on your punch list, then take care of that first thing tomorrow.
Would you do that?
Jenna, will you take care of the accessories? That'll be great.
Ladies and gentlemen, the thing
I am most proud of in the entire store.
- This is my son Max.
- Hi.
- How are ya, son?
- Good.
Yeah? Get some rest?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I wanna introduce you to a few people.
This is Keller Landreaux.
He's gonna be our store manager when we open in a few weeks.
Keller told us that we could buy property down here in New Orleans... for a song and a dime.
That's exactly what we did.
Smart man.
Glad to meet you, Max.
My pleasure.
Thanks for having me.
And this beautiful young lady we have right here... this is Jenna McCarty.
Jenna is the head buyer for the store... and she has promised to bring us a little bit of that Fifth Avenue flair... to Bourbon Street, yes?
Sure.
Nice to meet you, Max.
You too.
You know, Max, ladies love a man in uniform.
Yeah, Dad, I'm sure the polyester pants really help seal the deal.
And last but not least
I'd like to introduce you to Ryan P-
- What was your last name?
- Parker.
I'm just kidding you. Ryan Parker, our vice president in charge of operations.
- Good to meet you, Max.
- Likewise.
While you're out there on your rounds, you see something that doesn't look right... you got a problem with plumbing or electric, fire... you get a candy bar stuck in the vending machine, you call Ryan.
That's after you call me.
Listen. I'm gonna let you go.
I know you got a job to do.
And we need to continue on our rounds.
Good luck out there.
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right.
Shall we?
You all right?
Sorry. First night.
So, Max, you say you've been having those visions again?
Yeah.
Were you taking drugs or had you been drinking when you had this episode?
No. It was last night at my new job.
I saw a woman in one of the mirrors at my work.
You saw a woman?
Yeah. She was looking back at me from the other side.
Her reflection looked like a corpse.
She probably reminded you of Kayla in some way.
Your mind's way of processing the mental shock.
And the pills I prescribed?
Yeah, I took one.
- That's all?
- Yeah.
Good.
I wanted to take more, but I decided not to.
Very good.
So should we put the straitjacket on me now... or should we wait until my time's up?
I'm not worried about you, Max.
- No?
- Not at all.
What you're telling me, it's a good thing.
Yeah?
These representations of Kayla, hallucinations or not... are a sign that you're starting to get your life back in order... that maybe you're starting to let go of your misplaced guilt about her death... that you're ready to stop blaming yourself for what happened.
What intrigues me... is that now that you've stopped wallowing in the drugs and the alcohol... now that you're sober... your mind is ready to begin processing the tragedy in earnest.
You wanna come see me again next week... get back to a regular appointment type thing?
Sure.
Yeah.
I'll run the numbers tomorrow.
Okay. And then I placed the orders for size 8 through 12.
- No. No!
- Why? But-
It's like I told you earlier. I don't want to order any of the larger sizes.
But I don't-
Why, Jenna?
Why?
Because this Mayflower has to convey the message that it's a boutique.
And boutique implies skin and bones.
Yeah, I'm really sure.
Right, right. Okay.
So, if we do the research... and it shows that the demographic is full of heifers... then we'll order accordingly.
But listen to me- Until then, four is the new eight. Do you understand me?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you. Talk to you later.
Camera in the bathroom?
Henry, you dirty dog.
Just want to check in on my new favorite employee.
I'm good. Just happy to be here,
Mr. Landreaux.
We're happy to have you, Max.
Your dad entrusted me with the opening of the new Mayflower as my top priority.
You seem committed, being here so late.
Yeah. I can't let anything interfere with our grand opening.
Yeah. I should do my rounds.
Hey, Max, will you do me a favor?
Call me Keller.
We're all family here at the Mayflower.
Okay.
Jenna?
What are you-
No!
Fuck.
Mornin', rookie.
So, how did that last night go?
Everything all right?
Dr. Beaumont's office.
This is Max Matheson. I need to see
Dr. Beaumont as soon as possible.
Okay, let me see what I have.
How do you think this happened?
I don't know.
Looks more like a- just a terrible accident... but maybe someone killed her.
Homicide by handmade guillotine?
That would impress even yours truly.
Yeah, me too, Pete.
Me too.
- Dr. Beaumont?
- Yes?
Do you really believe all that, your explanation for what's happening to me?
Well, of course.
There's really no other explanation.
And the fact that it's all related to the mirrors... that that's how
I'm seeing these visions?
Méconnaissance.
What's that?
It's a French term from Jacques Lacan's mirror stage of psychoanalytic theory.
The ego is a product of false reflections.
Méconnaissance- when the subject is alienated from his or her self.
In English?
Nobody sees anything in a mirror... that isn't simply a part of them... not even things they think they're seeing.
Every culture has its own particular myth set regarding mirrors.
In Korea, for example... it's believed that a person's soul can be trapped inside of a mirror... as it leaves the body.
You've heard the old adage, a cracked mirror brings seven years bad luck.
And even here in the South's recent past... it was not uncommon to cover all of the mirrors in a house... where the wake of a deceased person was being held.
There's even a clinical diagnosis... for an intense fear of mirrors called spectrophobia.
Lots of psychic baggage in them there mirrors.
So I guess
I'm doing pretty well, then?
In light of all you've been through... combined with all the superstitions we hold regarding mirrors...
I'd say you're doing pretty good indeed.
How are ya holdin' up?
Fine.
Your father didn't tell you.
Tell me what?
Jenna McCarty, the woman you met the other day... she died last night.
They found her in her apartment.
How did she die?
The police said she fell through glass.
It ripped her head off.
It was a horrible accident.
Such a tragedy.
Are you all right?
Yeah. I'm... just surprised.
You sure?
Yeah.
- Will you call me if you need anything?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
I still can't believe it.
Hello?
Are you here? It's me.
Hello?
Oh, God.
I'm really starting to lose it again.
"P." "P." Parker.
Where's the number?
God!
Oh, God!
Hi. You've reached Ryan's answering machine.
I'm unable to get up and get the phone right now...
so leave me a message with your name and your phone number...
- Come on, goddamn it.
- and I will get back to you shortly.
Take care.
You ever seen a 10-56 like that?
I'm not sure.
One thing I know-
This is the second death of an employee who worked at the Mayflower.
The third, if you count the girl who went missing two months ago.
- Officer.
- Yes, sir.
The witnesses.
Where'd you put 'em?
Hey, Pic.
Check out the badge.
He's definitely a person of interest.
Hello?
Yeah, hi, Dad.
What time is it?
I don't know. It's late.
What's going on, Max?
I'm just- I'm calling to let you know that I'm-
I'm gonna be quitting my job.
Are you all right?
No, not really.
I can't keep working there.
It's too much.
Too much?
Yeah.
I think I'm seeing things again.
I'm really sorry.
I don't care about the job.
Just-
- I need to know that you're okay.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
Stop by tomorrow and drop off your ID badge and all that, you know.
Yeah, I will.
Thank you for understanding, Dad.
Max, I'm your father... and I do support you.
You know that.
Yeah, I do.
Okay.
Get some rest.
Okay.
What's wrong with you?
Dad!
Dad!
Max, what are you doing here?
I know what I need to do.
I came by-
- I changed my mind.
- Good for you.
I wanna stay at the Mayflower.
Come here.
Give me one.
Thank you.
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
We don't know why things happen the way that they do... but they have a tendency to work themselves out.
Everything happens for a reason, Max.
Yeah. Right.
Are you hungry?
Want a slice?
I'm good.
- Can you hold up a sec?
- Just need a minute.
May I help you?
Detective Huston, Homicide.
Detective Piccirilli.
What he said.
Homicide?
We just come by to ask you a few questions... about some fellow employees at the Mayflower... see if you might know anything about 'em that might be of interest to us.
We went by your house.
You weren't there.
Okay. And?
And why don't you tell us.
Tell you what?
You heard about one
Miss Jenna McCarty, correct?
Yes.
And you were also at the home... of Mr. Ryan Parker earlier tonight, weren't you?
Yeah. But-
Then certainly you must have gathered that he was dead, right?
Right.
Brutally murdered, as a matter of fact.
Hence, homicide.
Plural, actually, Pic.
Homicides, with an S.
You're right, man.
There've been two homicides... involving employees of the Mayflower this week.
Since you were at the scene of the crime tonight-
And in charge of security- it stands to reason that you might have an opinion or two about these matters.
Am I a suspect?
No.
- Not yet.
- Not yet?
Not officially.
What, not officially?
At this point the only thing you're suspected of... is being a lousy security guard.
So, why were you out front of the deceased's home earlier tonight?
Kind of a creepy coincidence, don't you think?
No.
I don't think it was a creepy coincidence.
Not at all.
And I might be a lousy security guard, but it seems to me that the two of you are... not too much better at the detective stuff.
If you'd have done your homework, you would've seen that...
Mr. Parker is the vice president of operations... here at this particular branch of the Mayflower Department Store.
And per protocol, if anything goes wrong, it is my duty... to contact Mr. Parker immediately.
Why not just call him?
As soon as you stop badgering me and you get back to your work... you'll be happy to see that the phone records indicate that I did, in fact... try to call Mr. Parker.
Probably, I might add, during the time at which Mr. Parker was being, as you say... brutally murdered.
Might be kind of hard for me to have been the one killing him too.
So you ran over to the deceased's home... to let him know you were having a problem with-
With the mirrors.
So unless there are any other questions,
I'd really like to get back to my work.
- No more questions.
- For now.
- We just wanted to stop by.
- Say hi.
And let you know that we got our eye out on you.
I feel so much safer knowing that.
Thank you very much, Detectives.
I don't understand.
Who are you?
What do you want?
She worked here.
- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Elizabeth Reigns?
Hi. Elizabeth.
Hi. I'm Max.
Hi.
You wanna talk about my sister?
You said you might have some information.
Yeah.
I think maybe I've seen her recently.
Where?
At the Mayflower.
Where at the Mayflower?
In the mirrors.
What- In the mirrors?
What do you mean, in the mirrors?
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy... but I see her reflection in the mirrors.
And l-
Then I turn around and she's gone.
She's not there anymore.
I don't know who put you up to this.
My sister, my little sister Eleanor has been missing for almost two months now.
And you just turn this into some kind of joke.
No, it's not a joke.
Listen to me.
- Listen, I'm serious.
- Don't touch me!
Just don't touch me.
I know what I said, it sounds crazy.
It's the truth.
So this started happening the first night that you were working there?
How can that be?
How is it that out of everyone that works there... you're the only one that can see my sister?
A year ago,
I was driving with my fiancée.
What?
Nothin'.
Okay.
Can you reach into the backpack, grab my phone for me?
- Yeah.
- I need to call my dad.
Okay, hang on. Drive safe.
- Okay, Max?
- Yeah. I got it.
- Please. Thank you.
- I can see.
Perfectly?
- Come on, I'm a great driver.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Where did you say it was?
In the front there.
Front. Front.
- Are you sure?
- Honey, it's right there.
Any luck?
Oh, my God.
Max Matheson, is this what I think it is?
- Well, what do you think it is?
- I don't know.
A drunk driver.
He hit you?
I swerved to avoid him.
I wrapped my car around a telephone pole.
Technically, it was my fault.
And your fiancée, she- she died in the accident?
We both did.
Start an IV.
Stay still, sir.
They brought you back.
Maybe I brought back something with me... some ability to see the other side or something.
Afterward, I just got pretty screwed up for a while- drugs, alcohol... whatever I could put into me.
Like I was trying to get closer to her or something.
- Wasn't your fault.
- I was the one driving.
You were trying to swerve to get out of the way. You were trying to save her.
Yeah, but I couldn't.
I couldn't save her.
You wanted to see her again.
Yeah. More than you could ever know.
How long's your sister been missing?
About two months.
And you still think she's-
Dead?
Of course, the cops say that young women up and leave all the time to start new lives.
But Eleanor and I... we weren't just sisters, we were best friends, we were soul mates.
And the night that she... disappeared...
I woke up from a deep sleep, screaming for no reason.
My heart was beating so fast,
I thought it was gonna explode.
I knew right then and there.
What was your sister doing the day she disappeared?
Working at the Mayflower.
There was some sort of party that night and she was- she'd just been hired on.
They were having a groundbreaking celebration.
I gotta get to work.
Yeah, I gotta get some sleep.
I gotta work again tonight.
Call me if anything else comes up.
Absolutely.
Thank you, Max.
I haven't done anything.
Not yet, anyway.
But you're trying.
That's more than anyone else has been willing to do around here.
Eleanor.
I'm trying my best.
I'm trying my best. Really.
Please. Stop doing this.
Wait. What are you doing?
Please, don't- don't do this.
Please.
No.
Tell me what I need to do.
Please, tell me. Just-
What is it? What?
Hello.
What night did she disappear?
It was a Wednesday night.
What was the specific date?
How come?
Well, it's a long shot, but I thought maybe...
if something happened to Eleanor while she was working here at the Mayflower... maybe the security cameras caught something.
It was Wednesday, September 22.
The 22nd.
It's not here.
What?
It's missing.
- Missing?
- Yeah.
Somebody erased it.
- Who?
- Well, give me a minute.
Yeah, last viewed September 24.
Two days after she disappeared.
Who was the last person to view those files?
Yeah, last viewed,
Henry David Schow.
Who's that?
He's the security guard I replaced.
The guy cut himself up and then quit.
They say he's gone totally crazy.
All after my sister went missing.
Can you pick me up?
Henry Schow?
Henry, you in there?
- Henry, is that you?
- Stay away from me.
Come on.
Henry, open the door.
I said stay away.
Henry, we're not here to hurt you.
We just wanna ask a couple questions.
Don't shut- Henry!
Who are you?
I'm your replacement at the Mayflower.
I'm the new night security guard.
You've seen her then?
Seen who?
Her.
Eleanor.
What do you know about Eleanor?
Nothin'. I don't know nothin'.
Henry, you don't have to lie to us.
- I'm not lying!
- Yes, you are! What are you hiding?
She wants to kill me.
Why does my sister want to kill you?
Your sister?
Henry, did you kill my sister?
No. I don't know what happened to her.
But why do you think she wants to kill you?
I don't know.
What about the files?
What files?
The digitized security camera files.
The one from the night she went missing.
The ones you erased, Henry.
I was just following orders!
Henry, who told you to erase those files?
Mr. Landreaux, Keller Landreaux... asked me to get rid of 'em, said it was important.
- Keller.
- That's when your sister first showed up.
That night.
That's when she started haunting all my mirrors.
Henry, there's something you're not telling us.
I told you everything.
Henry, now, my sister went missing the next day.
And somebody asked you to erase those security files from the cameras... and you didn't think that was a little bit suspicious?
No, I didn't.
I didn't think that. L-
I just didn't wanna know.
Henry, you need to tell us everything that happened that night. Everything.
I just want her to leave me alone.
She's not gonna stop this until she gets what she wants.
Until she gets the truth, Henry!
I don't know the truth.
Keller threatened my job, so I just-
I went along with him.
We were in the basement.
He said we had to erase the files.
I'm sorry!
The basement.
We have to go back to the Mayflower.
We have to check the basement.
Basement.
I'm sorry!
What is it?
There's rust on the ground.
I think it came from that.
It's been moved.
Give me a hand?
It's a crawl space.
You okay in there?
- Max?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Don't say a word or you're both dead.
I'm gonna be right back.
Max, we need to talk.
Just come out.
- Max, he's got a gun!
- Shit!
Fuck!
Really need to loosen that one up.
Look out, world.
Jenna McCarty's up to her old tricks.
Now, now. The only way to keep the new hires under your thumb... is to make sure you have dirt on them.
And nothing commands more respect than knowing that you... have made a complete and total asshole of yourself in front of the higher-ups.
You're bad.
- So where you from originally?
- So anyway-
- There's the guy right there.
- Here you go, miss.
You know that girl right there?
She's in accounting?
I've seen her before, but I haven't really met that many people yet, so-
And what about you?
I'm in operations, so, pretty much the day-to-day stuff.
I think she's got something for you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. You're drinking water?
- Yes. I've been so thirsty.
- Driving.
Elizabeth!
Help!
Look, I didn't wanna hurt your sister!
I don't wanna hurt you!
Why are you making me do this?
Why won't you listen to me!
Get off me!
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Honey, are you okay?
- I just-
- What happened?
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, boss.
She's, you know, been drinking.
Oh, no. Looks like somebody had a little too much to drink.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Keller's gonna take you home, sweetie.
Yeah, that won't be a problem.
Here, come here, baby. Here.
- Just get her arm.
- There we go.
- You'll be fine.
- There we go.
You'll be fine.
Just drink a lot of water.
Have fun.
Want a shot?
- Yes, please.
- Two.
- I left my purse at work.
- Okay, we'll go back. No problem.
My keys.
Wait.
- Where are we going?
- There you go.
I'm gonna get you home safe and sound.
I have to go home?
And here we are.
Let's get your keys and get you home.
I just feel so-
- No, no, no.
- Get off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Stop it!
We need to talk about this!
Eleanor, we need to talk about this!
Eleanor! Where are you going?
Come here!
I just wanna talk to you!
I just wanna talk to you!
What?
Help! Max!
Stop!
Don't move, bitch.
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up!
I can't let this happen.
Walk!
I just wanna talk to you!
I swear to Christ,
I'm not gonna hurt you!
I just wanna talk.
I just think you're a little confused, that's all.
Get down there, Eleanor!
- Eleanor?
- I just want to talk.
You're gonna ruin everything!
Get off of me!
This is your fault, Eleanor!
All you had to do was talk to me!
Fuck.
I'm so stupid!
I'm so stupid!
Help! Get off me!
Get off me!
Get back, Elizabeth!
Drop it, Keller.
It's over, Keller.
Oh, my God!
It's over.
We did it, Max.
So let me get this straight.
So even after you helped
Keller Landreaux... cover up the crawl space hole with a furnace... and erase all the digital files from the security cameras... you didn't think something was,
I don't know... fishy?
No, sir, I didn't.
But you'd heard the girl went missing.
Yes, sir, I did.
And you're willing to sign a confession admitting everything you've told us?
Yeah.
Which you understand... will be admitting to your role... in the conspiracy to cover up the murder of Eleanor Reigns.
What say we get this man a pen.
You took the words right out of my mouth, Pic.
Okay, what gives, Pete?
That was the easiest interrogation ever.
I don't know, Pic.
First time I ever played good cop, good cop though.
Must be some catch.
Always a catch.
Hello, Eleanor.
{666}{714}Who is it?
{715}{742}{Y:i} It's Tom.
{743}{844}Tom, your husband?
{846}{882}What's he doing here?
{1075}{1120}Uh, what's going on?
{1122}{1154}I'm sorry, I know I'm|not supposed to be here,
{1155}{1222}but Evelyn's school|contract's due tomorrow.
{1224}{1261}I knew I was forgetting something.
{1262}{1290}Let me, uh, find a pen.
{1374}{1434}Hey. Hey.
{1436}{1494}Not quite sure what Emily post|recommends in this situation,
{1495}{1522}but I'm Tom.
{1524}{1576}Damien. Hey.
{1578}{1633}Sorry to intrude.
{1634}{1672}I just--I wasn't quite sure|when she'd be coming home.
{1674}{1701}No problem.
{1702}{1740}{Y:i}Thank you so much for catching this.
{1742}{1825}Yeah.
{1826}{1874}Well, I'll get out of your way,|it was good to meet you,
{1875}{1901}{Y:i}and I'll see you later,|hon.
{1902}{1953}Bye.
{2130}{2193}So...
{2194}{2236}{Y:i}Seems like a nice guy.
{2238}{2285}Ooh.
{2286}{2338}Jules, you okay?
{2339}{2369}No, my stomach.
{2370}{2406}Here. Lie down.
{2474}{2514}Ow!
{2516}{2549}Try to--
{2550}{2612}get Tom.
{2614}{2657}{Y:i}Ow! Tom!

{3685}{3743}It's my one vice. I'm keeping it.

{4648}{4677}Bye, House.
{4679}{4730}Have a nice day.
{4810}{4860}"Have a nice day."
{4862}{4896}How civilized.
{4898}{4970}I said I'd stay t of it.
{5025}{5063}What?
{5065}{5091}Nothing.
{5093}{5125}Clearly something.
{5127}{5160}Nope.
{5162}{5191}{Y:i}House, on a list of your attributes,
{5193}{5245}there's nothing that|even rhymes with "coy."
{5247}{5367}Okay, I may have seen|something in the fridge.
{5368}{5446}Like the end of your relationship.
{5447}{5511}She put the milk in the|door and not on the shelf.
{5512}{5543}It's not a big deal.
{5544}{5569}You hate that she did that,
{5571}{5618}but you didn't say anything.
{5619}{5659}You're trying to get us to fight.
{5661}{5696}No, I'm trying to help.
{5698}{5746}If you got an issue, let her know.
{5747}{5776}I should have known|that you weren't done
{5778}{5819}sabotaging this.
{5820}{5872}Fine. Stew in your irritation.
{5874}{5919}{Y:i}And sure, last time|it bubbled over
{5920}{5955}{Y:i}into resentment and rage,
{5956}{5996}leading ultimately|to a painful divorce
{5998}{6053}that neither of you ever|really recovered from,
{6055}{6134}but I'm sure this|time it'll be great.
{6394}{6446}Interesting case.
{6447}{6507}35-year-old woman with|fever and abdominal pain.
{6508}{6567}E.R. ruled out all|the usual suspects.
{6568}{6613}Stop before you|interest me to death.
{6615}{6694}And she's in an open marriage.
{6695}{6739}That's not interesting.|It's just weird.
{6741}{6771}{Y:i} Know what's weirder?
{6773}{6844}That other humans are|monogamous in the first place.
{6846}{6904}{Y:i}No other species on the planet|mates for life
{6906}{6939}and if you're gonna bring up swans,
{6941}{6979}they cheat like everybody else.
{6980}{7039}They just have better|pr than rabbits.
{7040}{7092}Animals also eat their young|and kill their rivals.
{7094}{7128}That make it weird|that most of us don't?
{7130}{7174}Says the guy whose|opposable thumbs have been
{7175}{7221}all over how many women|who aren't his wife?
{7223}{7301}A functional open marriage|is like a Unicorn.
{7303}{7342}It's a mythical creature|that doesn't exist.
{7343}{7380}Someone always ends up unhappy.
{7382}{7424}{Y:i}Our patient's unhappy becau|se she's suffering
{7426}{7471}from an intestinal blockage.
{7472}{7512}Boring.
{7514}{7550}Then we have to find a|reason to rule it out.
{7551}{7606}What about herpes colitis?
{7607}{7651}She picks up the infection|from one of her partners.
{7652}{7683}It takes root in her colon.
{7685}{7728}Std panel was clean.
{7730}{7762}Chances are, this couple was|unhappy in the first place.
{7763}{7803}{Y:i}This is their attempt|to save something
{7805}{7830}that never--
{7898}{7952}go on.
{7954}{8014}{Y:i} Herpes might not|register
{8015}{8046}if she was exposed in|the last six weeks.
{8047}{8142}But it would show up|on a barium enema.
{8143}{8184}Wait.
{8215}{8242}You're gonna do it?
{8243}{8294}Gotta see if our|patient's a Unicorn
{8295}{8345}or just a slutty horse.
{8347}{8435}Think how much fun|Taub could be having.
{8436}{8531}Barium coats the inner|lining of your colon.
{8532}{8583}Lets us get a good look|at it on the X-ray.
{8585}{8636}I can get somebody|else to pick up Evelyn.
{8638}{8667}{Y:i}I feel like i'm abandoning you.
{8669}{8720}I'm on painkillers.
{8722}{8767}I'd rather this not|be what you think of
{8769}{8811}{Y:i}every time you look at my butt.
{8946}{9015}{Y:i}Okay, roll onto your side.
{9017}{9092}It's fill 'er up time.
{9228}{9281}So is Evelyn his new squeeze?
{9283}{9332}She's our daughter.
{9334}{9373}{Y:i}Must be interesting
{9375}{9428}{Y:i}growing up in a production of Oh!|Calcutta!
{9430}{9469}She's six.
{9471}{9505}She knows as much|about our sex life
{9507}{9538}as any other kid her age.
{9539}{9611}You can explain that|she's the reason
{9613}{9651}the two of you stayed married.
{9652}{9696}You've been in the|room five minutes.
{9698}{9736}You got us all figured out.
{9738}{9775}{Y:i}Of course, you left out|the part
{9777}{9803}{Y:i}where we love each other
{9805}{9836}and we want to grow old together.
{9838}{9887}But you just don't want|to be young together.
{9888}{9929}Look, when you think about it,
{9931}{9971}tons of couples do what we do.
{9972}{10009}It's just that with most of them,
{10011}{10067}one spouse doesn't know about it.
{10068}{10105}We decided things work better
{10107}{10144}when people tell|each other the truth.
{10225}{10280}Tank's full.
{10282}{10375}I'll page the radiology elves.
{10456}{10484}I'm not saying I hate it.
{10486}{10517}Just doesn't go with your eyes.
{10519}{10544}You hate it.
{10546}{10585}Little bit.
{10587}{10620}Any more heartless critiques
{10622}{10663}of my general appearance?
{10664}{10696}{Y:i} Nope. All done.
{10759}{10873}So is she as bendy as she looks?
{10875}{10897}Maya and I are just friends.
{10899}{10939}No, you and I are friends
{10940}{10997}and you don't have coffee|with me three times a week.
{10999}{11043}She's an interesting person.
{11045}{11092}She grew up in Ohio.|She has three brothers.
{11094}{11121}Fascinating.
{11123}{11154}Last week, that Cambodian lab tech
{11155}{11207}was telling us how he|survived the Killing Fields
{11209}{11256}and you left to go get a donut.
{11258}{11297}So we flirt. It's fun.
{11299}{11330}It's dangerous.
{11331}{11366}That woman would totally do you.
{11367}{11412}You think?
{11414}{11451}Nothing is gonna happen.
{11453}{11494}All I'm saying is if you|want to be on a diet,
{11495}{11587}you might want to stop hanging|out by the dessert cart.
{11589}{11641}X-ray was clean.
{11643}{11679}She doesn't have herpes colitis
{11681}{11716}or abdominal pain.
{11718}{11771}It stopped hurting|during the X-ray,
{11772}{11822}which means it was just an|intestinal blockage that passed.
{11823}{11862}We should discharge her.|Absolutely.
{11863}{11937}There's no need to find|any underlying cause
{11939}{11985}'cause these things|never happen twice.
{11987}{12048}Take her digestive|system for a test drive.
{12050}{12090}Give her a radio-opaque milkshake.
{12091}{12128}X-ray every 15 minutes to see
{12130}{12171}if it makes any unscheduled|stops on the way through.
{12172}{12209}We'll be here all night.
{12211}{12251}No, Taub will be here all night.
{12252}{12301}Talk to the Unicorn
{12303}{12355}and then tell me you don't believe.
{12357}{12396}I did an abdominal|ct on a kid today
{12398}{12451}and found a six-inch bezoar
{12452}{12508}made entirely of gum.
{12510}{12553}I mean, who gives a three-year-old
{12555}{12629}an endless supply of g--
{12699}{12726}you okay?
{12727}{12815}Yeah.
{12816}{12849}I mean, there was hair in it
{12851}{12903}and maybe a piece of paper.
{12975}{13053}So... how long you been married?
{13055}{13159}One of the few drawbacks|of having an open marriage.
{13161}{13234}Nobody ever asks me about|current events or the weather.
{13235}{13295}Yankees look good this season.
{13371}{13422}Seven years.
{13423}{13540}And, uh, how long have you-|you know?
{13542}{13627}After three years, we realized|that traditional marriage
{13629}{13676}was making us both miserable.
{13678}{13758}Most people get|divorced at that point.
{13759}{13786}Yeah, we didn't want|to get divorced.
{13787}{13820}We still loved each other.
{13822}{13905}We just realized that|expecting one person
{13907}{13975}to fulfill all of your needs|forever is unrealistic.
{13977}{14043}There are happy monogamous|couples out there.
{14044}{14091}{Y:i}Sure.
{14092}{14128}{Y:i}One or two have the perfect marriage.
{14130}{14202}{Y:i}Everybody else has figured out|how to settle for less.
{14203}{14308}{Y:i}I don't want to settle and end|up resenting my husband.
{14310}{14369}{Y:i}I'd rather g the 10%|he doesn't give me
{14371}{14463}{Y:i}somewhere else so that i c|an really appreciate him
{14464}{14522}{Y:i}for the 90% he does.
{14607}{14659}{Y:i}I think something's wrong.
{14661}{14683}With your stomach?
{14685}{14766}My heart is racing.
{14838}{14888}Try and take deep breaths.
{14890}{14971}I'm going to try to|slow your heart down.
{14973}{15016}Is this because of the blockage?
{15018}{15068}No. It's not working.
{15070}{15143}Need a crash cart in here!
{15244}{15286}{Y:i} I need a list of all your|sexual partners
{15295}{15318}{Y:i}from the last six months.
{15350}{15378}Why?
{15378}{15420}Your wife had an arrhythmia.
{15421}{15473}The progression of symptoms|from bowel to heart
{15475}{15521}makes a parasitic|infection most likely.
{15523}{15564}Since Julia hasn't been|out of the country--
{15565}{15601}the only place that|I've been recently
{15603}{15640}is a business trip to Nebraska.
{15642}{15680}But either of you|could have picked up
{15682}{15708}a bug from one of your partners.
{15786}{15859}It's kind of... complicated.
{15860}{15921}How many partners are|we talking about?
{15923}{15952}Ballpark.
{15954}{15996}None.
{15998}{16031}None?
{16032}{16084}{Y:i}We have a great sex life.
{16085}{16136}I don't need anyone else.
{16137}{16177}So why not just tell her that
{16179}{16207}and close this whole thing up?
{16208}{16232}You married?
{16233}{16268}I--I was.
{16270}{16356}Did you ever agree to go see|a chick flick with your wife
{16358}{16414}or pretend to enjoy|classical music?
{16416}{16453}Stravinsky never groped my wife
{16455}{16490}in a Midtown hotel room.
{16492}{16542}She needs this.
{16544}{16604}I don't.
{16606}{16648}But I don't want her|to feel bad about that.
{16718}{16748}He's lying.
{16749}{16796}{Y:i} Guy's got a license to drill.
{16797}{16833}{Y:i}Why would he lie about not using it?
{16835}{16869}That's not the lie.
{16871}{16928}The lie is that he gives a|crap about how his wife feels.
{16929}{16989}If they're both screwing around,|that's one thing.
{16991}{17040}But if she has a piece on|the side and he doesn't,
{17042}{17080}the only way he'd be okay with that
{17081}{17127}is if he's betraying|her in some other way
{17128}{17170}that, in his mind, makes them even.
{17172}{17224}My Unicorn isn't a Unicorn.
{17226}{17278}It's a donkey with a|plunger stuck to its face.
{17280}{17305}{Y:i}Right.
{17307}{17354}Even the guy who's not cheating
{17356}{17386}{Y:i}is doing it for underhanded reasons.
{17388}{17424}No, no, no. He's not being cynical.
{17425}{17468}He's assuming the husband|is doing something
{17469}{17524}to even the score,|which means he thinks
{17525}{17577}{Y:i}there is a score,|which means,
{17579}{17656}cheating swans aside,|House believes in monogamy.
{17658}{17695}He's being romantic.
{17696}{17738}What I believe is that men
{17740}{17779}are genetically|engineered to be jealous.
{17780}{17824}{Y:i}Doesn't matter if i thi|nk there's a score.
{17825}{17852}I guarantee you he does.
{17853}{17901}Any of the wife's partners pan out?
{17903}{17937}She's been with two|people other than Tom
{17939}{17977}in the last six months.
{17979}{18032}Neither of them have been|outside the tri-state area.
{18033}{18087}So we're back to the husband.|You just said you believed--
{18088}{18164}he's doing something|behind her back.
{18165}{18208}What better cover than a|business trip to Nebraska?
{18210}{18256}Like that's really a place.
{18258}{18303}Let's find his travel records
{18304}{18353}and get back to work.
{18393}{18432}You seem pretty mellow
{18433}{18468}about this couple's deal.
{18469}{18523}Thought you'd be first in|line to shake a finger.
{18524}{18604}They're still married. I'm not.
{18606}{18655}Not that I could ever do it.
{18656}{18700}I was jealous of House and|Cameron never touched him.
{18701}{18760}Not counting the|emotional fondling.
{18811}{18876}When my mom was dying,|my dad had an affair.
{18936}{18968}He told you this?
{18970}{19028}I'd seen them get out of his car.
{19030}{19073}Two years after mom died,|they got married.
{19075}{19108}That must have sucked.
{19110}{19162}At the time, yeah.
{19164}{19234}But looking back... It makes sense.
{19236}{19285}{Y:i}My mom never knew about it
{19287}{19326}and he needed someone to|make him feel less alone.
{19328}{19372}{Y:i}He took care of my mom
{19373}{19428}day in and day out for 2|1/2 years before she died.
{19429}{19475}He was devoted to her.
{19476}{19549}Loving someone else|didn't change that.
{19551}{19604}So loving two people|at once is fine
{19606}{19644}as long as one of them is dying?
{19646}{19676}{Y:i}Whoever's taking care of me
{19678}{19723}when I get sick, I hope they've got
{19724}{19793}{Y:i}someone else to take care of them.
{19844}{19868}{Y:i}Tom was telling the truth.
{19870}{19924}He really did go to Nebraska.
{19926}{19990}Plane ticket and restaurant seats.
{19992}{20056}{Y:i}Forget Nebraska.
{20057}{20168}Maybe they just bought their|parasites at the mall.
{20170}{20244}You know, we should really|throw away that loofah.
{20245}{20272}They're imported.
{20274}{20312}Sometimes they're not sterilized.
{20313}{20362}We think our patient got|amoebiasis from hers.
{20364}{20410}Is she gonna be okay?
{20412}{20455}We're treating now.|She should be fine.
{20456}{20572}It's actually kind of bizarre.
{20574}{20621}She and her husband|have an open marriage.
{20724}{20776}They sleep with other people?|Well, she does.
{20777}{20845}Her husband's totally fine with it.
{20847}{20956}I mean, it's crazy, right?
{20957}{21052}And you're bringing|this up because?
{21100}{21174}I thought it was interesting.
{21176}{21277}More interesting than|your other cases, I guess.
{21279}{21323}I mean, you talk about|your colleagues,
{21324}{21359}you rant about House.
{21360}{21469}You don't usually|mention your patients.
{21471}{21564}Is open marriage|something you want?
{21566}{21606}No.
{21608}{21680}I mean...
{21682}{21740}I know you'd never...
{21847}{21904}All this time and energy
{21906}{21968}you spent convincing me|you weren't cheating...
{21970}{22002}And there's somebody else.
{22004}{22056}{Y:i}I'm not-- some more|water sir?
{22318}{22416}Okay.
{22418}{22455}There's a woman at work.
{22456}{22508}People say she's attracted to me,
{22510}{22552}but nothing's happened.
{22553}{22603}Nothing's going to happen.|I'm not having an affair.
{22604}{22640}But you want to.
{22642}{22708}No, honey.
{22710}{22747}I'm trying to be honest.
{22748}{22820}I don't want to make|the same mistakes.
{22822}{22885}Be honest then.
{22887}{22932}Are you attracted to her?
{23052}{23132}Look... she's attractive.
{23134}{23174}There's an attraction.
{23176}{23224}Aren't there men who|make you feel that way?
{23225}{23296}Of course there are,|but it never occurs to me
{23298}{23372}to act on it because-|because I'm married...
{23373}{23426}To you.
{23428}{23508}And that's enough for me.
{23509}{23555}Aren't I enough for you?
{23556}{23664}Of course you are.
{23665}{23756}Our patient's lost all|movement in her legs.
{23758}{23793}There are other doctors, Chris.
{23795}{23840}We're talking.
{23842}{23905}I'm sorry.
{23907}{23987}The woman's paralyzed.
{23988}{24051}I'll get a cab.
{24353}{24407}Tests show no spinal cord injury,
{24408}{24455}no cerebral lesions, no hemorrhage.
{24462}{24489}{Y:i} Finally got a stool sample.
{24491}{24513}{Y:i}The loofah's innocent.
{24515}{24551}No sign of amoebas
{24552}{24602}{Y:i}or any other parasites.
{24603}{24635}So paralysis, arrhythmia,
{24637}{24671}and intermittent abdominal pain.
{24673}{24788}And he nicked himself shaving.
{24790}{24850}Sorry. That was Taub.
{24851}{24899}But it was easier to solve.
{24900}{24944}Means he used the crappy|razor in his locker,
{24946}{24983}which means he slept here.
{24985}{25051}Thanks to you.
{25052}{25134}I brought up open|marriage with Rachel.
{25135}{25198}It was a disaster.
{25236}{25286}On the medical front,
{25287}{25335}we've knocked out sex|and foreign travel.
{25336}{25383}Could be an electrolyte imbalance.
{25384}{25428}So the only time you're not|interested in my marriage
{25430}{25456}is after you bw it up?
{25458}{25489}You're the moron who|took marital advice
{25491}{25516}from Tila Tequila.
{25518}{25546}You pushed me into this.
{25547}{25590}Figured it would either|blow up your marriage
{25591}{25624}or make it more honest.
{25626}{25651}{Y:i}Either way, you win.
{25653}{25710}What about sex?
{25711}{25735}I'm talking about the patient.
{25737}{25761}Is that cool with everybody?
{25763}{25810}We've ruled out sex.
{25811}{25848}We ruled out sex with other people.
{25850}{25904}Tom said he and Julia|have been doing it
{25906}{25957}{Y:i}three or four times a week and she|'s got boys on the side.
{25959}{25995}Increased libido can be a symptom
{25996}{26042}of adrenocortical carcinoma,
{26043}{26083}which also explains|her other symptoms.
{26085}{26173}A woman who likes sex must be sick?
{26175}{26206}{Y:i} Just because everybody|in this room
{26207}{26267}wishes that all women|were horny all the time
{26269}{26334}doesn't make it so.
{26335}{26366}Get an mri of her adrenal glands.
{26563}{26638}Hi.
{26639}{26680}Okay if I take the sports page?
{26682}{26726}Sure.
{26852}{26899}Would you mind using a coaster?
{26900}{26927}Oh.
{26928}{26971}Sure.
{26973}{27000}Sorry.
{27002}{27039}It's okay.
{27166}{27193}{Y:i}Also, it'd be great|if you'd replace
{27195}{27251}the toilet paper when|you finish a roll.
{27253}{27287}{Y:i}And when you load the dishwasher,
{27288}{27350}you can't put a big,|flat bowl on the bottom.
{27351}{27427}It traps the water so nothing|on the top gets clean.
{27429}{27482}And please don't throw banana|peels in the bedroom trash.
{27483}{27562}I haven't done any of those things.
{27563}{27590}You're probably not even aware of--
{27591}{27638}I hate bananas.
{27775}{27823}Oh, my God. It was House.
{27824}{27881}I'm sorry.
{27883}{27920}He's been trying|to get us to fight.
{27922}{27992}Why would he think that|stuff would make us fight?
{27994}{28021}Because of the milk.
{28023}{28075}You put it in the door.
{28076}{28159}The body of the refrigerator|is the coldest part.
{28161}{28189}The temperature in|the door fluctuates,
{28191}{28227}which decreases shelf life.
{28228}{28255}Wow.
{28256}{28291}When did you get all ocd?
{28292}{28363}I just want clean dishes|and unspoiled milk
{28364}{28401}so we can all stay healthy.
{28403}{28483}Oh, it's about health.|What about the coaster?
{28485}{28570}Does that replenish|my B-12 or something?
{28571}{28596}Can we just drop it?
{28598}{28642}Sure.
{28819}{28896}You have this list of annoyances
{28898}{28972}{Y:i}the entire time we were married?
{28974}{29027}Get better, mommy.
{29028}{29071}I love you, rabbit.
{29102}{29175}Julia, you have a guest.
{29283}{29307}Hi.
{29308}{29338}This isn't a good time.
{29339}{29383}{Y:i}Dr. Hadley, did you say
{29385}{29428}there was a video|game in the playroom?
{29430}{29511}Maybe you can teach me|how to play one of them.
{29512}{29543}See you in radiology.
{29663}{29705}Get out of my wife's room.
{29707}{29748}{Y:i}Your relationship with her sta|ys out of our space.
{29750}{29801}I was worried about her.
{29803}{29851}Tom's right. You should go.
{29852}{29943}So it's fine if we have sex,
{29945}{29972}but if I drop by to|see if you're okay--
{29974}{30020}this is our family.
{30122}{30155}Sorry.
{30359}{30403}I spent two years of residency
{30405}{30469}wearing shirts that|were a size too small.
{30471}{30523}How hard is it to ask me not|to put them in the dryer?
{30524}{30569}And I only did your laundry|because you were never home.
{30571}{30619}I didn't ask you to.|Of course you didn't.
{30621}{30679}You just got annoyed whenever|you didn't have clean underwear.
{30680}{30705}I never said I was annoyed.
{30707}{30741}That's the point.
{30743}{30777}You didn't say anything.
{30779}{30827}So I'm getting a lecture|on communication
{30828}{30876}from someone who had|her lawyer inform me
{30878}{30903}our marriage was over.
{30975}{31017}Asking for an open marriage.
{31019}{31068}You got stones.
{31070}{31116}Conversation sort|of got away from me.
{31118}{31156}It was a train wreck.
{31158}{31206}I think it's good|you brought it up.
{31207}{31262}I read a study that found|men who have multiple copies
{31263}{31297}of a certain vasopressin receptor
{31299}{31351}are twice as likely|to be unfaithful.
{31353}{31395}Maybe you're just|one of those guys.
{31397}{31483}So my cheating is|biologically predetermined?
{31484}{31512}Fantastic.
{31514}{31539}Multiply times five.
{31540}{31562}We need a better|look at the medulla.
{31563}{31591}I thought you'd be relieved.
{31593}{31621}This gets you off the hook.
{31623}{31656}It's just genetics.
{31658}{31695}I'm 5'6" and have a|receding hairline.
{31697}{31729}I hate genetics.
{31731}{31766}Medulla's clean.
{31767}{31799}I don't see you wearing|lifts or hair plugs.
{31801}{31826}That's because being short and bald
{31827}{31859}doesn't hurt anybody.
{31860}{31899}The only thing hurtful|about your other
{31901}{31959}genetic predisposition is|that you keep denying it.
{31960}{32022}It's not good for you or Rachel.
{32023}{32083}There's nothing there.|It's not adrenal cancer.
{32085}{32151}And maybe you're right about me.
{32153}{32182}But I'm not gonna stop trying.
{32183}{32212}Rachel's worth it.
{32214}{32258}Look up there.
{32259}{32283}The lung.
{32285}{32336}What is that?
{32338}{32378}You served me with divorce papers
{32379}{32431}in the middle of a medical|conference in New Orleans.
{32433}{32475}I threw a bottle into|an antique mirror.
{32476}{32510}Oh, you exhibited an emotion?
{32511}{32544}I wish I'd known you were capable.
{32546}{32574}I loved you.
{32575}{32600}I thought I was gonna|be following you
{32602}{32633}to Baltimore, remember?
{32635}{32679}I called about apartments.|I set up interviews.
{32681}{32724}How could you think that we|still had a real marriage?
{32726}{32770}We hadn't had a|conversation in months.
{32771}{32824}Maybe because I was working|two jobs to support us.
{32826}{32855}No! No!
{32856}{32887}It's because when you were home,
{32888}{32915}it was like talking|to a block of ice.
{32916}{32952}You were obviously|so pissed off at me.
{32954}{32990}I was killing myself|so that you could take
{32991}{33024}that non-paying internship.
{33026}{33059}That you said that I should take.
{33061}{33085}I was trying to be supportive!
{33087}{33116}Why do I have to be the bad guy?
{33118}{33174}Expressing yourself does|not make you the bad guy.
{33175}{33219}Okay, then. You were|being a selfish bitch.
{33295}{33359}VQ scan confirmed the spot|on Julia's lung was a clot.
{33360}{33416}Think there's a chance|the husband's a plushie?
{33418}{33450}If he has a secret,
{33451}{33511}I highly doubt it's more|relevant than the clot.
{33512}{33563}Clotting disorder would|explain everything.
{33564}{33609}{Y:i}Question is, which one?
{33611}{33683}Do you read any of your|departmental memos?
{33685}{33732}Only the ones labeled, "n-s-f-w."
{33734}{33784}Accounting notified|you two days ago
{33786}{33829}about your patient's insurance.
{33831}{33875}Sorry, that's "n-n-s-f-w."
{33876}{33934}Here. He doesn't have any.
{33935}{33975}Try not to bankrupt them.
{33976}{34014}Oh, I'm long past the|number of procedures
{34015}{34058}that'll bankrupt them.
{34059}{34085}Julia's got insurance.
{34087}{34115}I saw the policy|number on the form.
{34116}{34151}But the policy lapsed|due to non-payment.
{34152}{34203}I already made three|calls about this.
{34205}{34258}You should have been aware of that.
{34383}{34410}No, there's just a mistake.
{34411}{34477}Of course we have health insurance.
{34479}{34581}We're actually a little|behind on the premiums.
{34583}{34624}{Y:i}But I pulled money
{34626}{34654}{Y:i}out of my retirementccount to cover it.
{34655}{34694}They said that we'll be fine in--
{34695}{34743}Why the retirement account?
{34781}{34843}We'll just give you|a few minutes to--
{34901}{34929}and by "we," she means "she."
{34978}{35069}I lost all of our savings.
{35173}{35214}Sounds like a secret to me.
{35298}{35334}I started her on heparin to prevent
{35336}{35384}further clots, but we still|don't know what's going on.
{35385}{35431}Of course the husband's|secret was money.
{35433}{35486}If it's not sex, it's always money.
{35488}{35538}Unless it's sex for money.
{35540}{35576}How did he lose it anyway?
{35577}{35641}It's not medically relevant.|You're not gonna care.
{35642}{35673}Wilson's been teaching|me how to care. Try me.
{35674}{35721}He builds wind turbines
{35723}{35748}and leases them out to|local power companies.
{35749}{35772}You're right. I don't care.
{35773}{35818}Clotting disorder: Dic.
{35820}{35901}Factor five leiden,|antiphospholipid syndrome.
{35903}{35937}Vitamin k deficiency also fits.
{35938}{36017}Causes thrombophilia and is|consistent with abdominal pain.
{36018}{36073}Congratulations, House.|Sam ended it.
{36074}{36105}What happened?
{36107}{36139}Go test our patient's blood.
{36141}{36197}But it can wait five minutes.
{36198}{36249}For everything we discussed.
{36388}{36423}I'm sorry.
{36425}{36505}Well, at least you're|actually taking responsibility
{36506}{36542}{Y:i}for once in your life.
{36544}{36607}Sorry that she left.|It's not my fault.
{36609}{36637}{Y:i}I didn't even want
{36639}{36664}to get involved.
{36665}{36704}You dragged it out of me.
{36705}{36757}What about the|dishwasher and the banana
{36759}{36796}{Y:i}and the toi--
{36797}{36861}she left because of the banana.
{36863}{36915}I just wanted you to|stand up for yourself.
{36917}{36958}{Y:i}Tell her what you want.
{36960}{37018}If doing that causes|her to walk out
{37020}{37046}{Y:i}for the second time,|well, your relationship
{37048}{37085}wasn't gonna last anyway.
{37087}{37132}Or you could have stayed out of it.
{37133}{37167}{Y:i}I could have kept my mouth shut,
{37169}{37214}been annoyed sometimes,|but I'd be happy,
{37216}{37265}because I'd still be with her.
{37266}{37335}Now all I have is cold milk.
{37337}{37376}{Y:i}As long as you're free,
{37377}{37456}you want to grab some dinner?
{37537}{37581}Did Tom go home for the night?
{37582}{37632}For starters.
{37633}{37713}I told him to leave.|I don't want him here.
{37715}{37794}Money is a complicated subject.
{37796}{37835}Yeah, it's not the money.
{37837}{37905}I mean, the-|the money's bad, but...
{37995}{38033}When we first opened our marriage,
{38035}{38119}I got involved with a guy|who lied about being single.
{38121}{38185}Then one day, his wife calls me.
{38186}{38297}She's crying and screaming|and totally out of control.
{38299}{38393}And I felt...
{38394}{38443}superior.
{38445}{38509}I thought I don't ever have to|worry about feeling this way
{38510}{38582}because Tom and I are|honest with each other.
{38685}{38729}Well, here I am.
{38878}{38917}Hi.
{38988}{39034}Sorry I didn't make|it home last night.
{39036}{39083}I needed to run some tests.
{39085}{39157}You know what the worst part was?
{39209}{39281}When y had your affair...
{39282}{39334}Wasn't the sex.
{39336}{39416}It was the lies.
{39417}{39485}Realizing that the|narrative of my life
{39486}{39548}was totally wrong.
{39549}{39593}You weren't stuck in surgery.
{39594}{39665}You weren't out of town.
{39667}{39747}I don't want to go|through that again.
{39749}{39797}I told you nothing's--
{39799}{39887}Thursday nights.
{39889}{39964}You have to be home by midnight.
{39965}{40003}You don't bring her here.
{40005}{40081}{Y:i}You don't talk to h|er about me
{40083}{40165}and I don't want to meet|her ever in any context.
{40321}{40411}Are you giving me permission|to sleep with other women?
{40413}{40460}It's what you want, isn't it?
{40461}{40535}I want you.
{40537}{40611}You want more than me.
{40613}{40677}You want that thrill.
{40751}{40803}But I love you.
{40805}{40874}And I really believe|that you love me...
{40876}{40920}And we have a good life together.
{40921}{40967}{Y:i}And at this point,
{40969}{41063}either I walk away|or I try to accept
{41065}{41116}who you really are.
{41117}{41208}Tomorrow's Thursday.
{41209}{41272}Yes, it is.
{41405}{41458}All our tests came back negative.
{41460}{41509}It's not a clotting disorder.
{41510}{41573}Which means we need to|come up with a better idea.
{41574}{41686}So what causes problems in|the stomach, heart, nerves?
{41688}{41745}Oh, my God.
{41801}{41854}You know what it is?
{41972}{42051}Taub's wife gave the green|light for an open marriage.
{42053}{42089}{Y:i}He's wearing cologne,
{42091}{42137}but not the stink of shame.
{42139}{42188}{Y:i}You got a date.
{42189}{42240}I am going out with Maya tonight
{42241}{42313}with Rachel's blessing.
{42341}{42389}Mazel Tov?
{42390}{42466}Maybe the problem isn't her blood.
{42468}{42501}Maybe it's the vessels|carrying the blood.
{42502}{42566}No sign of schistocytes|or hemolysis.
{42568}{42615}So you're actually going|to sleep with another woman
{42617}{42653}then go home to your wife?
{42654}{42686}{Y:i}Thank God someone's
{42688}{42725}keeping us focused on|what's really important.
{42726}{42785}Taub was gonna do|all of that anyway.
{42786}{42828}Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
{42829}{42894}Imaging showed normal diameter|in her pulmonary artery.
{42896}{42969}{Y:i}Here's a thought--
{42971}{43029}Taub's wife is now|totally on the market.
{43031}{43073}Mind hitting me with her digits?
{43157}{43235}She would love that,|but duty calls.
{43368}{43407}What's the matter?
{43409}{43438}My stomach.
{43440}{43465}Same pain as before?
{43466}{43502}Yeah, but worse.
{43504}{43541}Get the portable|ultrasound in here.
{43542}{43580}We need to get a look at her belly.
{43581}{43629}Help me!
{43761}{43806}Pain, pain went away,
{43808}{43856}came back another day.
{43857}{43917}Question is, what brought it back?
{43919}{43974}Physical exam was unrevealing.|Ultrasound was clean.
{43976}{43998}So afterwards, are you gonna shower
{44000}{44034}at your girlfriend's or at home?
{44036}{44077}Patient. Abdominal pain.
{44079}{44108}Yeah, he's right.
{44109}{44152}Let's get this wrapped|up before 6:00.
{44153}{44239}Taub turns back into a|faithful Pumpkin at midnight.
{44241}{44293}Patient was out with her|boy toy before she came in.
{44295}{44341}Maybe the pain was triggered|by sexual excitement.
{44342}{44399}Because lying alone|in a hospital bed
{44401}{44443}contemplating bankruptcy-- hot.
{44445}{44506}My point was that|arousal is a function
{44508}{44554}of the parasympathetic|nervous system.
{44556}{44589}{Y:i}If that's where the problem is,
{44591}{44631}{Y:i}the pain could be triggered by crying,|which seems--
{44633}{44673}pns. Also controls digestion,
{44675}{44708}which she's been doing without|screaming her head off
{44709}{44749}{Y:i}since she's been here.
{44751}{44799}What if what matters isn't|when the pain started,
{44801}{44837}{Y:i}but when it stopped?|It was during an X-ray.
{44839}{44896}You think that cured her?
{44897}{44945}No, but House prepped her for|the X-ray with a barium enema.
{44947}{45023}Well, that wouldn't|treat anything except--
{45025}{45087}go.
{45089}{45125}You're in pain because|part of your intestine
{45126}{45155}folded in on itself.
{45157}{45181}It's called an intussusception.
{45183}{45217}It's cutting off blood flow.
{45218}{45265}We need to fix it before your|bowel gets necrotic and dies.
{45267}{45301}Once you do that,|will I get better?
{45302}{45329}When this happens in adults,
{45331}{45369}it's usually a sign|of abdominal cancer.
{45371}{45398}We'll fix the overlap,
{45400}{45441}and then search your|intestine for tumors.
{45587}{45621}Foam?
{45665}{45747}I have a bad feeling about this.
{45749}{45789}A friend can't spontaneously buy
{45791}{45821}{Y:i}an overpriced itali|an espresso machine
{45822}{45886}for another friend?
{45888}{45929}What did you do?
{45930}{45977}Nothing. That's the beauty.
{45978}{46036}I genuinely tried to help Wilson.
{46037}{46076}I told him to stand up for himself,
{46077}{46119}which you know is|legitimate advice.
{46121}{46153}And his relationship blew up.
{46154}{46193}Is he okay?
{46194}{46220}Ah, he'll be fine.
{46221}{46256}Point is, I realized something.
{46257}{46322}I do nice things,|nice things happen to me.
{46324}{46355}Karma works.
{46357}{46413}So you're paying it forward?
{46414}{46499}If this should somehow|lead to Lucas dying
{46501}{46565}or oral sex,
{46567}{46612}so be it.
{46613}{46637}Namaste.
{46840}{46892}Think I should wear a tie tonight?
{46893}{46927}This isn't weird at all.
{46929}{47033}I mean, where's|Rachel eating tonight?
{47035}{47085}{Y:i}Home.
{47087}{47124}What if she's going out too?
{47190}{47240}She is allowed to, right?
{47241}{47297}Of course. It's only fair.
{47299}{47333}But I don't think she will.
{47334}{47376}Your wife only eats dinner at home?
{47454}{47500}If she did go out,
{47501}{47543}that would be tough,
{47545}{47593}{Y:i}but I think i can handle it.
{47595}{47634}Don't do it unless you're sure.
{47636}{47694}I know I'd rather be|jealous than a liar.
{47696}{47745}Got something here.
{47747}{47800}Kelly clamp and scalpel.
{47801}{47850}Biopsy showed|non-specific inflammation,
{47852}{47889}which suggests ibd,
{47890}{47941}only it doesn't explain|the cardiac problems.
{47942}{47988}Or her declining kidney function.
{47989}{48042}We ran panels during surgery.
{48044}{48137}Actually, ibd does make sense,
{48138}{48201}'cause it could trigger|ankylosing spondylitis,
{48203}{48253}which would explain the|heart and the kidneys.
{48255}{48332}Start her on sulfasalazine|and tnf-inhibitors.
{48333}{48373}Oh, and Taub,
{48374}{48441}I'm not gonna see you before|you head off for gomorrah.
{48442}{48487}Just remember,|if you get disoriented...
{48524}{48586}Breathe through your nose|and look for the horizon.
{48953}{49008}I can't.
{49009}{49078}I really thought I could do this.
{49131}{49211}Logically, it makes perfect sense.
{49213}{49285}But...
{49287}{49349}all afternoon,
{49351}{49454}all I kept thinking about|was the two of you,
{49456}{49508}together,
{49509}{49545}and you touching her.
{49546}{49619}Nothing's happened.
{49621}{49657}It's okay.
{49659}{49704}I'm sorry.
{49705}{49753}'Cause I really wanted it--
{49755}{49796}no.
{49797}{49844}I've been an idiot,
{49845}{49876}and I don't need anything else.
{49877}{49925}I just need you.
{49927}{49985}You mean that?
{49987}{50040}I do.
{50161}{50200}I love you, Rachel.
{50201}{50225}I love you too.
{50227}{50273}Let's go home.
{50274}{50305}Is that okay?
{50307}{50381}There are other doctors.
{50595}{50633}{Y:i} The treatment's not working.
{50635}{50664}{Y:i}Her left kidney failed last night.
{50665}{50693}{Y:i}The other one's right behind it.
{50695}{50750}It's not ankylosing spondylitis.
{50752}{50808}Kidney biopsy showed she|had iga nephropathy,
{50809}{50845}which could be caused by
{50846}{50903}or associated with any|of these conditions.
{50905}{50959}We've gone from too|few ideas to too many,
{50961}{51021}and our patient's|running out of time.
{51022}{51091}Why the lack of afterglow?
{51093}{51148}Physio girl not as|freaky as you'd hoped?
{51149}{51198}I went home with my wife.
{51200}{51257}After all that,
{51258}{51289}you chickened out.
{51291}{51381}I can't hurt Rachel like that.
{51382}{51449}Sickle cell anemia would|have shown on blood tests.
{51450}{51493}{Y:i}No flattened intestinal villi|rules out celiac.
{51565}{51605}Seriously?
{51607}{51639}Our patient's dying,
{51641}{51708}and we can't move past my sex life?
{51709}{51741}Seriously,|you'd think it'd kill her
{51743}{51789}if we spend 15 seconds mocking you?
{51790}{51843}Time's up.
{51845}{51879}{Y:i} Normal liver enzymes
{51881}{51935}{Y:i}rules out hep b and cirrhosis.
{51937}{51986}Alport and anti-gbm antibody
{51988}{52016}are both untreatable,
{52017}{52051}so if she has them|we can't help her.
{52053}{52111}And it can't be|henoch-schonlein purpura.
{52113}{52151}No inciting respiratory infection
{52153}{52192}and no rash.
{52193}{52223}I don't care what it's not.
{52225}{52254}I want to know what it could be.
{52256}{52330}Well, everything left on the list.
{52332}{52377}The list was not created equal.
{52379}{52417}Neither was man, by the way.
{52419}{52452}{Y:i} Hemochromatosis is a possibility.
{52453}{52486}Excess iron builds up,
{52488}{52525}{Y:i}causes problems throughout the body.
{52527}{52603}Weil's syndrome also affects|multiple organ systems,
{52605}{52641}{Y:i}and it wouldn't have been|treated
{52643}{52681}by the antibiotic the E.|R. gave her.
{52683}{52719}Sarcoidosis makes sense too.
{52721}{52765}Good.
{52767}{52817}Treat for those three.
{52923}{53020}I think you should call Tom.
{53021}{53057}Am I gonna die?
{53094}{53145}I don't know.
{53147}{53201}If he walked in here right now,
{53202}{53270}I'd look in his face and all|I would think is "liar."
{53272}{53319}Don't you think|that's kind of unfair?
{53321}{53376}You say honesty's all-important,
{53377}{53414}{Y:i}but you conveniently igno|re the truth
{53416}{53467}{Y:i}that some truths hurt people.
{53469}{53505}Tom lied to protect you.
{53507}{53569}He was covering his ass.
{53570}{53618}I'm not talking about the money.
{53696}{53729}Tom hasn't slept with anyone else
{53730}{53780}{Y:i}in over a year.
{53781}{53848}He told you that?
{53897}{53983}So my entire marriage is a sham?
{53985}{54029}No.
{54031}{54104}Your husband, who only wants you,
{54105}{54194}lied so that you could be happy.
{54196}{54237}That seems pretty real to me.
{54342}{54376}Yeah?
{54458}{54485}Hey.
{54487}{54511}Hey.
{54721}{54763}Listen, I'm sorry.
{54765}{54819}Me too. I shouldn't have said--
{54821}{54880}no, you were right.
{54881}{54953}I was selfish back then.
{54954}{55042}I'm trying to change.
{55044}{55085}And I don't know if|it's House or what,
{55086}{55168}but... you're different too.
{55169}{55233}I'm trying.
{55298}{55402}I always thought that I|was keeping the peace,
{55404}{55470}but I was just resenting you
{55472}{55521}and giving you a reason to leave.
{55650}{55753}I wish we had this|fight ten years ago.
{55869}{55953}Is it okay if we don't|give House the credit?
{55954}{56018}Oh, I recommend it.
{56179}{56240}{Y:i} "O" for three.
{56241}{56276}Her kidney function|is still declining.
{56277}{56317}We're gonna need to start dialysis.
{56318}{56381}{Y:i} Glad the husband's back.
{56383}{56424}After missing so|many little deaths,
{56425}{56456}he should be here for the big one.
{56457}{56505}Top six, anyone?
{56507}{56562}Polyarteritis nodosa?
{56564}{56661}We'd have seen some|improvement on prednisone.
{56662}{56702}Guy's wife's dying,
{56704}{56749}and he stops to buy flowers.
{56750}{56783}They're from his garden.
{56785}{56817}Mercury poisoning fits.
{56819}{56889}Those are lilacs.
{56941}{56977}My mom used to grow lilacs.
{56979}{57051}My dad made her get rid of them,
{57053}{57101}'cause there were too many bees.
{57103}{57168}{Y:i}We ruled out hsp
{57169}{57217}{Y:i}'cause there was no inciting|respiratory infection.
{57218}{57285}But in rare cases, it can also|be triggered by a bee sting.
{57287}{57367}We also ruled it out|because there's no rash.
{57369}{57409}Maybe we just didn't see it.
{57553}{57613}Have you been stung|by a bee recently?
{57615}{57679}Uh, about a month ago.
{57730}{57766}What's going on?
{57768}{57861}I think your wife has|henoch-schonlein purpura.
{57862}{57917}{Y:i}Systemic vasculitis|can cause
{57919}{57992}lesions and inflammations|throughout the body.
{57993}{58050}It's pretty awful,
{58052}{58094}which explains why it was|named after a German.
{58096}{58143}Actually two germans.
{58145}{58213}{Y:i}Lesions can pop up in the heart,
{58215}{58293}sometimes in the kidneys,|but always on the skin.
{58294}{58337}Means you'd have a rash somewhere.
{58338}{58374}I don't.
{58376}{58407}{Y:i}Not that you know of.
{58457}{58529}Okay, I'm gonna have|to check your holes.
{58531}{58566}I'll start with the mouth.|If there's nothing there,
{58568}{58615}then things might|have to get kinky.
{58617}{58645}Say aah.
{58647}{58710}Aah.
{58712}{58758}I was kinda hoping for kinky.
{58760}{58803}Is that good or bad?
{58805}{58844}{Y:i}We'll treat her
{58845}{58893}with high-dose ivig|and cyclophosphamide.
{58895}{58956}{Y:i}You should be fine.
{58957}{59010}I'm gonna be okay.
{59078}{59148}I love you.
{59149}{59182}That is adorable.
{59184}{59259}Other than you still wanting|to have sex with other dudes,
{59261}{59311}and him bankrupting your family,
{59313}{59363}I think you kids are|pretty much home free.
{59517}{59563}Mm-hmm?
{59565}{59633}And...
{59634}{59661}You two made up?
{59662}{59705}No.
{59706}{59757}You can thank me later.
{59758}{59817}I'm all-in.
{59819}{59910}All right.

When I was a child, my mother would tell me a story about how the Devil roams the Earth.
Sometimes, she said, he would take human form so he could punish the damned on
Earth before claiming their souls.
The ones he chose would be gathered together and tortured as he hid amongst them, pretending to be one of them.
I always believed my mother was telling me an old wives' tale.
My mother's story would always begin the same way, with a suicide paving the way for the Devil's arrival.
And it would always end with the deaths of all those trapped.
I'm good.
I feel good. I feel amazing.
You know the main reason why people go back to drinking?
No.
Guess.
The Eagles.
Resentment.
Are we seriously talking about this again?
It's important.
Your ability to forgive is gonna determine the quality of the rest of your life more than anything else.
Look, some things are beyond forgiveness.
You're already on your way.
You've taken responsibility for your actions.
That's more than half the battle right there.
But to truly feel free, you may need to finally start believing in something greater than yourself.
That sounds good.
It does.
But when I think about the guy that killed my family,
I have a tough time believing in much of anything.
I'm just saying, leave yourself open to it.
Can we just have breakfast for once?
Talk about normal stuff.
I'm your sponsor.
You can talk about normal stuff with everybody else.
Hey. Got a good one for you.
Yeah?
Yeah, it doesn't make sense, right?
A guy hits a truck with this kind of force from a two-story building?
Definitely a jumper.
Are you sure he wasn't thrown?
He's got a rosary in his hand.
Not the kind of thing you grab in a panic.
Right.
Elsa.
Bowden.
Hi.
There's no glass on the ground.
The truck wasn't here when he made impact. It must have rolled.
Uh-huh.
Your guy jumped from that building.
And what? Your dead guy turned the corner, here?
These things are made to bounce trucks off.
You got to be kidding me.
Let's walk it.
Yeah.
Larson.
Hey! Hey, lady, you got to sign in.
Oh. Where's Ramsey?
He knows me.
Ramsey's out sick.
You got me.
And that means you gotta sign in.
I mean, do I look like such a threat?
Don't blame me.
They got procedures.
Keep dreaming, dawg.
You have to cover the sign in.
Some lawyers on 39 need this right away.
You're not taking the stairs again.
What else am I gonna do to stay in shape?
To 39? Just get on the damn elevator.
Come in.
It's too tight for me.
You can squeeze in.
No.
Hold, please.
Thank you.
Forty-two, please.
You bet.
Now, see, this I can do.
Could you hold that?
Uh. Sorry.
Thanks for your help.
Don't mention it.
Uh-uh, this is not good.
Oh, come on, man.
Don't do this.
Come on, Timonen, put a stick on it.
How we doing?
Same score.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Why is elevator six in inspection mode?
Huh?
Elevator six.
A full house.
Two queens, three jacks.
Call Dwight.
Yeah.
Yo, Dwight, you got a problem.
Tell me about it.
I'm already up on 35 fixing it.
The elevator?
No, the broken window.
You're not fixing the elevator?
Screen says six is on inspection mode.
We got people stuck in there.
Are you sure you're reading that right?
Your eyes ain't what they used to be.
You know what?
I'll ask your mom to read it for me next time I got her bent over the console.
My mom's 78.
Have at it.
Ooh!
Yeah. Listen, buddy, just go up to the machine room and check it out, okay?
On my way.
Just trying to get something to jump-start it.
Don't you have emergency procedures?
I don't know, I'm just a temp.
I just started working here.
Well, don't you service these things?
Try hitting the emergency button.
Don't you keep up your equipment?
I don't know.
Like I said...
Don't you have a walkie-talkie?
No. I didn't think
I'd need it.
Don't you think it would have been...
Won't you shut up?
Yeah, take it easy.
I mean, seriously!
You don't have a walkie-talkie?
Hey, people, we see you in there.
We're stuck!
Hang tough, we got the building engineer on his way.
When was the last time you heard somebody say "hang tough"?
What did you say?
Nothing.
Is he picking a fight?
Can one of you look towards the camera and say something loud and clear, please?
Your building sucks!
I can't hear you.
The speaker in the car is supposed to let us talk both ways, but you can hear me?
It's working on this end, yeah!
He just said he can't hear us, didn't say we should talk louder.
Okay, um, give us a sec.
Well, this is reassuring.
I got to be somewhere.
You're not gonna get a signal in here.
I just need to call my job so
I don't get fired over this.
Typical bullshit.
Do any of y'all have a signal?
I've got one bar.
Hello? This is Larson.
Can you please connect me to my job at the security desk?
Can you hear me?
Tell them to get us out of here!
Hello?
They'll just have to deal.
Well, at least we got tunes.
Don't sit under that apple tree with anyone else but me
Come on, grandma, you know the words.
Anyone else but me
Don't be a jerk.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Miss Manners.
Did I offend your noble sensibilities?
Why don't you lay off, pal?
Why don't you suck a butt?
This is great.
Let's just pick on the nice guy for bringing a little levity.
Maybe we should all just stop talking for a while.
Sure.
Okay, I was just joking.
I'm joking.
Hey,
Dwight, are you there yet?
Almost.
Hey, look, man,
I'm just glad you're dating again.
I'm just glad you're glad.
You know what I meant.
You know, after all your troubles...
I know what you meant.
So, how's that been going for you?
Good.
Ninety days tomorrow.
Wow, 90 days!
It seems like just yesterday since we...
Not to me, it doesn't.
You wouldn't happen to have a broken window up there, would you?
Yeah.
Facing this direction?
Mmm-hmm.
Big enough to fit a person through it?
I suppose.
Please stop sweeping.
I'm declaring this a crime scene.
Car 602.
What the hell is that?
Look out!
You might want to secure that better.
Okay, okay!
In her story, innocent people always die.
Poor souls just trying to help out, who didn't realize what they were dealing with.
He doesn't take kindly to those who stand in his way.
Hey, old man.
It doesn't say inspection mode here.
Circuits look fine.
Okay.
Try flipping elevator six.
I'll tell the people in the car.
You count to 20, then do it.
Cool.
"Inspected and certified
August 12 by G. Carson."
Hey, what do you say we go visit G.
Carson when we're out of here?
Tell him what we think of his inspecting prowess.
People, we're gonna flip off the lights for one sec to see if there's a short in the breaker.
You're gonna cut off the power?
Does that mean we could drop?
You'll be fine.
I just didn't want you to...
- What's happening?
- Come on!
Nothing.
Nothing. Just relax.
Come on.
Get off me!
Get off me!
Sorry.
What's wrong with you, man?
When I was younger, my brother locked me in a trunk for six hours.
I have trouble with tight spaces.
Oh, great.
Come on.
Can we get out through that?
What are you gonna do?
Shimmy up the cables?
You'll be a lot safer in here.
Anybody know where the bathroom is in this thing?
Did it work?
Nope, they're still stuck.
Let me go check the mains in the basement.
All right, thanks a lot. Wow.
What's going on?
You know that window on 35?
Yeah.
Looks like somebody might have jumped through it.
Today?
Yeah.
This morning.
Thanks for bearing with us, people.
We should get you back on line in a few minutes.
It's been minutes.
How long is it going to take?
When we get out of here, you're gonna need a good rest.
"Mattress Mania"?
That's us. Everybody's had their mattress too long. Am I right?
You didn't follow that advice about flipping it every few months and now you've worn a groove into it, and you think,
"Well, I'm used to it.
"So, hey. But I do miss the way it felt
"when it came fresh out of that bag."
Look at those shoes, they've been through the mill.
They're saying, "Someone deserves a better place to lie down."
Are you insulting my shoes?
The point is, a new mattress will cost a lot less than you think.
You don't have to be as well-off as this one.
I'm not that well-off.
What makes me good at selling mattresses is I can look at a person's clothes and know exactly how much they can afford to spend.
And you, lady, you're no Super Sleeper.
Oh, my God. They keep playing this song over and over and over.
Can't they just turn the music off?
Did you just touch my ass?
What?
You wish, sweetheart.
I don't know who you think you are, but keep your hands off me.
Whatever.
Oh!
They must be working on the lights again.
Hey, Dwight.
Dwight.
I'm here.
I'm heading into the pit.
They just lost power in number six again. Is that you?
No, you can't do that from here, D.L.
Huh.
That's strange.
I'm looking at elevator six right now.
I can't see anything wrong with it.
The lights keep shorting out.
The passengers are getting scared.
See if this helps.
Come on, come on.
Oh, God.
Come on, come on.
Anything?
No. No change.
The only other thing
I can think to do would be going back up to the roof, climbing down and resetting the car manually.
Yeah, yeah. Good. Do that, do that.
Call me when you get there.
All right.
Hey.
What?
All right.
Get out of here.
Off you go. Off you go.
There you go.
Oh!
Shit!
"Inspected by G. Carson."
What was that?
What?
I thought I heard...
Ah!
Shit.
Are you all right?
I'm just...
I think someone pulled my blouse.
I'm... I'm...
- You're bleeding.
- Here. Here. Stand up.
Let me help you.
I think I got cut.
What's going on in there?
I don't know.
They're just scared.
I think that lady got hurt.
Did she?
Yeah, see that?
What in the world?
Oh, my God.
What's he saying?
I can't tell what he's saying.
I can't tell what you're trying to say.
Turn off the...
Turn off the music!
Maybe they don't like the music.
The music's still on?
Yeah.
Turn it off.
It's probably driving them nuts.
Okay. How?
There's a kill switch right behind the...
Right under the key box.
Thank you!
What happened to her?
It feels like something bit me.
Wait, wait. Does anybody have anything sharp on them that might have cut her, she might have cut herself on?
- No.
Why you got blood on you, man?
She fell into me.
So you cut her?
What? No. No, something must have happened to her and then she fell into me.
She probably did it to herself!
- Come on!
- Bit her own back?
You think this is a bite?
No, nobody got bit.
What else could have done that?
I don't know.
A serrated blade could have.
You wouldn't happen to have a knife with a serrated blade on you, would you?
No.
Okay.
You mind if we search your pockets?
Yes, I do mind.
You mind if we search yours?
Go right ahead.
Maybe she has a serrated blade on her!
Are you seriously suggesting that I would do this to myself?
I don't know.
Give me another reason to kick your ass.
Please, bro, take it easy, okay?
Bro?
I'm not your bro.
Can you turn towards the camera and show us what happened to you, please?
Oh, my God.
Whoa!
Okay, we gotta call the police.
We have a possible 240 at 333 Locust Street.
333 Locust?
That's gotta be right around...
...here.
Strange.
602 responding. Happen to be right outside. Put me on it.
Copy that, 602.
That's convenient.
I don't make the calls, they just come for me.
Go.
Markowitz!
Hey, how's your girlfriend?
Shut up.
What are you doing?
I thought I saw something.
What do you mean?
Like what?
Something.
Okay.
You see it?
Yeah, yeah.
Look, that's just...
That's just grain in the image.
That's, you know...
It's a mistake.
It's like when people see Jesus in a pancake or something.
No. No. No.
Ramirez. Ramirez, you're freaking me out. Come on.
Hey, hey.
Hey, listen to me.
We need to convey calm.
These people are relying on us, okay?
So stop this shit right now.
Come on.
Come on!
I don't even know why we're trying this.
We're in the express shaft.
There's not gonna be another opening till the 23rd floor.
Maybe we're close.
Could this elevator fall?
I doubt it.
Because we gotta be 20 floors up, just dangling over nothing.
Can we stop talking about this, please?
One more time.
On three. One...
Oh, no, no, no.
Stay away from me, man.
I can help. I want to get out of here, too.
Why don't you sit your creepy ass down in the corner over there?
We can all keep an eye on you.
Are you ready? On three.
One, two...
Three.
I'm just over here.
And why do you think this might be an assault?
She seemed to be having words with one of the other passengers just before it happened, and now it looks like they're all keeping an eye on him.
Which guy?
That guy, right there.
Do we have communication?
Yeah, we have an open line here.
You can talk, but we can't hear.
Hello, everyone. This is Detective
Bowden, Philadelphia P.D.
We're working hard to get you out of there. Shouldn't be much longer.
Please just remain calm.
How soon till we get in?
Engineer's working on it now.
Usually, we get these things going pretty quick.
This engineer work for you guys or the elevator company?
Works for us.
Okay.
Call the elevator company and have them send someone, okay?
And have the Fire Department send some guys.
You got it.
At least one of your staff is aboard.
Oh, yeah, the guard there, he's a temp, actually.
Ben something. I don't know.
He started yesterday.
Okay. Call the temp agency and get all the info they have on him.
And the others?
We don't have names for the others.
What?
He should see the face.
No.
What face?
No. Nothing.
I saw a face.
Look, there's no face.
Tell him about the face.
No. Look, Ramirez is kind of religious.
Just ignore him. Trust me.
I'd like to get a sense of who you all are.
Stop it right now, comprende?
One at a time,
I'd like you to hold up your driver's license to the camera so I know who
I'm talking to.
That's a good idea.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Try and get it closer to the camera.
The letters are too small.
Is there a sharpness setting on this thing?
No, that's as good as it gets, right there.
You can put your ID's away.
Thanks.
Do any of you have a pen on you?
No one?
Here you go.
I want you to account for everyone on the visitors' log.
Find out which of these people didn't show up for their appointment.
You got it.
You sure?
Okay.
Keep him away from me.
Must be working on the power again.
The geniuses have done a bang-up job so far.
Any other exits?
No, sir, that's everything.
Hey.
I got some info on your guard.
What have you got?
Check this out.
We got...
Hey.
Something else is happening.
Is he dead?
602, we have a possible 187.
I need backup.
How do you rewind this thing?
Rewind, fast forward and that's frame-to-frame.
Frame-to-frame.
Everyone, just keep breathing.
We're gonna get you through this.
Just take it easy, okay?
So today, someone committed suicide, a woman got hurt, now a man is dead.
Yeah, what are you trying to say?
Look, how many times have you seen a child fall and barely miss the edge of the table with their head?
Why is it so rare that they hit it?
Get to your point.
Look.
What are you doing?
You're embarrassing yourself.
When he's near, everything goes wrong.
Toast falls jelly-side down, children hit tables and people get hurt.
Hey. The police do not want to hear this stuff, Ramirez. Okay?
So just stop. Now.
Sometimes he takes human form and torments the damned on
Earth before stealing them away.
Where I come from, we call it
The Devil's Meeting.
Is this guy for real?
Look, I'm sorry. Ramirez.
You must consider that one of those people might be the Devil.
All right. Come on.
I need you to stop telling campfire stories and get your head in the game.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Markowitz, look at this guy right here.
Yeah.
Lights go down, they come back up, he's closer, but he's moving away.
What were you saying about the guard?
All right. Yeah.
He's a real piece of work.
Assault, assault, assault.
Beat a guy into a coma with a baseball bat. That's great.
These the kind of guys you hire for security?
Like I said, he's just a temp.
Some temp.
Could that mirror break from him hitting it?
Then how did...
What's that cop doing out there?
He's probably trying to figure out which one of us is the murderer.
In the story, men would always try to fight him with force, but some battles can't be fought with weapons.
Will you all please clear a space between the camera and the body so I can see him?
Don't touch the body.
This is a crime scene now.
Though I know you're stuck in there,
I expect you to do as little damage to it as humanly possible, got it?
Any luck with the elevator company?
They're out of business.
I guess that figures.
A shard of glass sliced up and into the jugular.
This is definitely not an accident.
Who chooses a contained room with three witnesses for a killing?
Unless they're so worked up, they can't control themselves.
These people are shook up, but they don't look murderous.
I'm missing something here.
I need a volunteer to help me out.
There's a piece of paper hanging out of his pocket.
Very carefully, I want you to take it out and hold it up to the camera.
"Vince."
It looks like "McCormick."
The return address is for the Better Business Bureau.
They have an office on 35.
You got a freight elevator?
Yeah.
I've never seen a person die.
Neither have I.
It's pretty awful, huh?
So, what, you have?
Yeah, I spent some time in Afghanistan.
You see some things you wish you hadn't.
Wait, so you've been trained to kill people?
Ooh-rah.
How's your jumper shaping up?
Hey.
Can you take a look at this suicide note? Most of it makes sense, but then it ends with, "I can hear the Devil's footsteps draw near."
Usually, suicide notes are either all crazy or all rational, but this one's both.
It's strange, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
This one?
Elevator key.
Key's not catching.
All right.
Try the Halligan.
Something's jamming it.
Look, if I can...
If I can get up there,
I can maybe figure out what's wrong with this thing.
I'm a mechanic. I'm pretty good with this sort of thing.
He's trying to escape.
He's trying to escape.
He's trying to escape!
He's trying to escape!
Stop! Stop!
Stop it!
Stop! What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
We're all gonna stay right here until this thing is over.
You knew what I was doing!
I told you what I was doing!
I don't know you!
It's not our policy to discuss cases under review.
It kind of damages the reputations of our member businesses.
Look, someone just killed him on his way here.
I need to know who knew he was coming here and who wanted him dead.
The line would stretch around the block.
The guy was a real scumbag.
Three years ago, he started one of those Ponzi schemes and when it collapsed, a lot of people lost their asses.
One guy even killed himself over it.
Do you have a list of people that got burned by him?
Yeah, the ones that filed.
I'm gonna need it.
So, what do you say we get to know each other a little bit better?
Here. Come on.
Frisk me. Search me.
See that I'm not carrying anything suspicious.
Come on!
You're next.
There's a good chance one of our people didn't sign in.
How's that?
'Cause that person might be on this list.
What's this?
Our victim lost a lot of people a lot of money.
These are the ones that filed complaints.
The killer's probably smart enough not to be on both lists.
Look for the one that didn't sign in.
Did you just want video of the guy who died, or also the girl that got hurt?
All of it since they got in the car.
Okay.
Detective.
You see?
That's what you're talking about?
Everybody believes in him a little bit, even guys like you who pretend they don't.
What's this?
An apology note left at the site of a hit-and-run.
My wife and son were killed down on Bethlehem Pike five years ago, but that's okay, because whoever did it is sorry.
You can tell by the heartfelt apology on the back of a car wash coupon.
So, no, I don't believe in the Devil.
We don't need him.
People are bad enough by themselves.
Stop the tape.
Back it up.
Faster, faster.
There. Now, play it.
She was acting like he grabbed her.
What is she up to?
Folks, do me a favor, keep your hands off each other.
Leave the police work to me.
I'll be in there any moment.
Won't I?
Stop it.
I don't like him touching me.
He's touching me.
I don't like it!
Stop pushing him onto me.
Stand back.
Hell, no.
I know you're not doing what it looks like you're doing!
Spray that in here, you're gonna blind all of us.
Seriously, put it down.
Lady...
Dwight, where are you? You gotta stop disappearing, seriously.
Dwight.
Hang on a sec.
Dwight, you gotta get us in that car right now. Where are you?
I can't.
Dwight, I need you to stay on walkie!
Man...
Can you see this?
Huh? You see this?
"Use by October 21, 1987."
She was scared. Relax.
She tried to pepper spray me, man!
Dwight, where are you?
We're being saved.
Dwight, where are you?
Come on, pick up.
Pick up!
They hear something.
They hear your guy moving in the shaft.
Then how come he's not answering?
Dwight? Dwight, this is serious. You need to pick up, Dwight.
Thank you!
Pick up, Dwight. Pick up.
Oh, no.
No, no. Hey! Hey!
Hey! Oh, no. Hey!
Hey! You all right?
Hey!
Come on.
Come on! Hey!
Dwight, where the hell are you, man? Come on!
What floor did Dwight enter the shaft from?
He entered from the roof.
What are they looking at?
Dwight. Dwight, pick up.
Looks like he fell. He's impaled right on top of the elevator.
Hurt real bad.
Possibly dead.
Hey, Bowden,
I think the people in the elevator can hear our radios.
Yeah, that's confirmed.
Can you switch to channel eight?
The car's stuck on 21.
Markowitz, tell the Fire
Department looks like they have to go through the wall on 21.
This is Lustig.
You can't just go through the wall.
Sure we can.
That's why you have insurance.
Fire command, go to eight, please.
There she is.
Sarah Caraway.
We know the security temp is Benjamin Larson and we know McCormick.
What other names are unaccounted for?
Jane something. Looks like "Kowski."
The older woman.
Find me footage of this guy.
This way, ma'am.
- Let's go.
- All clear.
Okay, this time slow.
You gotta be kidding me.
Did she just steal that lady's wallet?
So Vince was a scam artist, this woman Jane's a thief,
Sarah there is a liar and our guard is a thug.
Quite the crew we have here.
I still haven't seen this guy here.
What was that?
It's okay.
Hard drive crash.
I got it.
Number 2.
Here we go.
Any other angle on the lobby?
Just the main entrance.
There.
Okay, rewind back.
Faster.
There he is. Stop it.
Where's that satchel?
He doesn't...
There's no satchel in the elevator.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Shit.
Oh, no.
What's happening?
I can't take this anymore!
Don't come near me, any of you!
Maybe, if I could just check the wiring...
What the hell's going on?
Please.
Please turn on the light.
Turn on the lights!
That's it.
Shut down the building.
Bring everyone down to the lobby.
Nobody comes in or out but us.
Which guy do you think is doing this?
There are three people in there and they're all capable.
Well, she's not doing it.
I'm ruling nobody out.
Fire Department wants to know if you have a shut-off valve before they get through the wall, just in case.
Yeah, it's in the basement.
I'll go.
They're bad people, that's why they're here.
No, two of them are here because they just got on the wrong elevator.
Yeah, and I just happened to have the wrong job and you just happened to take the wrong call.
He never does this in secret.
There's a reason we're the audience.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.
No one's getting in this building right now.
I know. I'm supposed to meet somebody upstairs.
You're gonna have to call them and tell them you can't make it.
Can you just tell me what's happening?
He always kills the last victim in front of the person they love most to make cynics of us all.
No, no, no.
Don't touch her.
I'm not gonna leave her just hanging there.
Where you gonna put her?
I haven't thought that far ahead.
Funny how all this stuff starts happening right after you start working here.
Seems to me, you're the only one who knew where the cables are.
What are you doing?
Trying to close her eyes.
That doesn't work, not until they're dead for a few hours.
Okay, you enter the building with a satchel.
You see a sign-in desk you wanna avoid. Where do you go?
Restroom.
Yep.
Got it.
Could those be used to rig an elevator?
I have no idea, but he doesn't sign in and then he hides these?
What the hell is that?
I wish he'd stop.
I don't even know your name.
I'm Ben.
I'm Sarah.
I'm Tony.
So where'd your claustrophobia go?
Excuse me?
I've never seen claustrophobia come and go like that.
You trying to say something?
Then say it. Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I'm saying
I didn't do this, and I very much doubt that she did, so that leaves you.
I'm saying I think this claustrophobia thing...
I think it's an act.
Yeah, I'm saying
I think you're a liar.
Kill him, Ben!
Kill him before he kills us!
Kill him!
Stop it! Stop!
Stop it! Get us out!
Get us out! Get us out!
Back away from each other now!
Get off!
We're gonna keep you safe and here's how, everyone get to a corner and place your hands on the wall so everyone can see that you're not up to anything.
Go ahead. Do it!
You won't have to keep this up long.
The building is surrounded by police.
In a hypothetical conversation that I'm not really having, how would this story of yours end?
They all die.
That's it?
Yeah.
This is not your fault.
They made the choices that brought them here.
Hey.
You're gonna love this.
What have you got?
She has a criminal record, too.
Three counts of blackmailing rich married men.
Now where this gets interesting, is couple of years ago, the arrests stopped. Guess why.
Tell me.
Well, her name is
Sarah Caraway.
"Caraway" Caraway?
Yeah.
She married into the family.
So she shoplifted an heir.
Yeah, something like that, I guess.
What's she doing here?
According to the sign-in sheet, she was gonna see a lawyer on 42 named Wayne Kazan.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hey, listen up!
Quiet down! Quiet down!
Hey, quiet!
Philadelphia P. D!
I'm looking for a Wayne Kazan.
Is there a Wayne Kazan down here?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Heads up. Did you have a meeting today with a Sarah Caraway?
I don't know.
Do you have a subpoena?
Come on, you can tell me that much.
I might have. Why?
She was attacked.
Who has motive to hurt her?
Well, you know I can't divulge personal information.
Come on, man.
Give me something.
Give me something to work with here.
I'm trying to save your client's life.
Come here.
I guess I'd do what you guys normally do and start with the person closest to her.
Thanks.
And just so you know, my specialty is forensic accounting.
Markowitz, get Mrs.
Caraway's husband on the phone.
Should be okay now.
All right, get in there.
I might have found the problem. It's a bad wire.
Looks like it could be shorting out the circuits.
Okay.
Easy. Easy.
That's it.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Vasquez, we're gonna need the large Target saw up here as fast as you can bring it.
Look, we need two more on 21, okay, guys?
Any luck getting hold of the husband?
No, not yet.
I called his office and his secretary said he'd call me right back.
Back up! Heads up, heads up! Come on!
Heads up! Back up!
Move out of the way!
Get away! Back up!
What happened?
Anybody see what happened?
Medic!
He came through the door.
Breathe. Breathe.
Lustig.
Back away!
Back away! Move back!
Get everybody back.
Back away!
Put your hands back on the wall.
It hurts.
Put your hands back up on that wall.
Or what?
Just leave her alone.
She's in pain.
Don't you see what she's doing?
Chick's a twist.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, that's what we used to call people like her in the Marines.
Suddenly out of the blue, everybody would start fighting with each other.
Tempers would flare, people would start getting hurt.
But then we realized it's just the new guy telling everybody what other people said, stirring shit up where there wasn't any.
Until one night when we beat the living shit out of that twist.
And then, just like that, everything would go back to normal.
Are you threatening me?
I just want you to know that I know.
Why don't you just shut up and keep your hands on the wall?
Sarah
Caraway's husband won't talk to us.
He lawyered up.
Her lawyer told me she's locating all his money.
I bet she's about to leave him and he might know it.
That would definitely give him motive to kill her.
But if he's trying to kill his wife, why are Jane Kowski and Vince McCormick dead?
This is Matt with
Caraway Security.
I need someone from maintenance to come down and shut the bay doors.
Sarah Caraway's husband doesn't own Caraway Security, does he?
Meet me in the office!
He's not done yet.
It's the Kensington sniper all over again.
What's a Kensington sniper?
A few years ago, a guy shot four strangers and then his own wife, trying to make a personal killing look like a serial.
The guard works for the woman's husband.
I think the two victims were just a decoy.
The guard is gonna kill her.
I need to be in that elevator right now!
Move!
Right.
Please don't let him kill me, Ben.
I won't.
Come over here next to me and I'll keep you safe.
Don't worry. Come on.
Hold up your cell phones.
Use the screens as flashlights.
Don't let it go dark in there.
Keep the light on each other.
Keep shining it all around the elevator.
Don't you do it.
Don't you do it.
It just doesn't make any sense.
Oh, my God. It is you.
Please, lady.
They can't hear you.
You don't have to pretend anymore.
We both know who did this.
Yeah, we do.
Put down the glass and get your hands on the wall now!
I should kill you right now.
I should kill you right now before you try anything else.
I should cut you right now.
And what'll be your defense? Huh?
"She killed them all, so I had to kill her"?
Yeah, something like that.
You take me down, they're pinning all of this on you and you know it.
A big, tough guy like yourself.
This is what he does.
He wants us to doubt everything.
Markowitz.
Markowitz?
We're getting close, boss.
Hurry up!
How would I do it?
Do what?
According to your story, how would I save them?
There's no easy answer.
You're never gonna get these people to see themselves as they really are
'cause it's the lies that we tell ourselves, they introduce us to him.
Look at what you're doing.
Don't think just because I'm a cop
I don't know what you're going through right now.
I've been to hell.
Six months ago, I...
...checked into a hotel and I nearly drank myself to death.
The thing is, when you're self-destructing, it looks like it's the world's fault.
Like you're dealt a series of shit hands, but that's not real.
Okay? It was all on me.
All of it.
I realized my only way out of hell was to take responsibility for what I had become.
You are responsible for this.
You realize that, don't you?
Take responsibility for what you're doing.
Put down the glass.
Put down the glass.
I'll put this down if you do, too.
Okay?
We'll call a truce.
Good.
You're doing the right thing.
Sir, we found a woman who thinks she knows someone in the elevator.
Send her in.
No.
Get in there!
Get in there! Now!
We're through!
This is the woman
I was telling you...
Hold her outside!
Tony.
You know him?
He's my fiancé.
He had a job interview here today and he didn't want to bring his tools in with him.
I was late picking them up.
Tony what?
Janekowski.
Tony Janekowski.
Jane Kowski is Janekowski?
He signed in.
Then who is...
Come on, breathe.
Right there. Come on, breathe.
Breathe! Come on, come on. Please breathe.
It's her! It's her.
Get in there already.
Who are you?
- Today?
I'm an old woman.
Grab her the moment you get in.
Are you ready for your turn, Anthony?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The whores, the liars, the cheats and the deserters, it's always the same thing.
You know who I am now.
Yes?
Take me.
I intend to.
No, take me instead.
I deserve this.
You don't believe that.
Yes. Yeah, I do.
I should never have left.
It's my fault.
It's all my fault.
You think you can make some kind of bargain?
Take me instead. Please.
Stop saying that!
You think this will make you good?
You're not good.
I know.
You think you can make up for the choices you made?
No.
You think you can be forgiven?
No.
Channel eight.
I killed a mother and her son on Bethlehem Pike five years ago.
Uh.
It was a hit-and-run and I was never caught.
I'm so sorry.
No.
Damn.
I really wanted you.
Come on, come on, come on!
Where is she?
Where'd she go?
I'll take him in.
That was my family on Bethlehem Pike.
That was my son.
I've been waiting for this moment for five years.
All the things
I'd say to you and what I'd do.
The thing is...
...I forgive you.
After my mother would finish her story, she would always comfort us.
"Don't worry," she'd say.
"If the Devil is real, then God must be real, too."
Did you save your patient,
Daddy?
Of course.
You know I'm the best.
Sure.
And me?
You're the best at being naughty.
Something else.
Something else?
Hold on...
You're the best little girl in the world.
Give me your hand.
I'll deliver my invitations after lunch.
Your party's in two weeks.
Come with me.
Princess, I'm beat.
Ask Mom.
She'll help you.
No, I want to go with you.
Daddy's tired, Jasmine.
After school, okay?
No, I'll just do it by myself.
I didn't get my dessert.
My dessert.
Thank you.
There.
If no one's home, leave the invitations in the mailbox.
I know, Daddy.
I love you.
I'm beat.
I need sleep.
Unplug the phone on your way.
I'm only going in 15 minutes.
We have time.
Sylvie, I'm exhausted.
You can just lie there.
I'll take it from there.
Hi.
I brought Jasmine her homework.
What do you mean?
She wasn't at school this afternoon.
Is she sick?
No.
- You didn't see her?
- No.
Thanks.
Jasmine?
Why didn't they call?
They left a message asking why she wasn't in school after lunch.
Didn't you answer?
I was asleep.
You know.
When did you wake up?
Around 2:30.
And you only listened to it now?
Do you normally drive her to school?
No, she usually goes on her own.
Does she walk with anyone, a friend?
- Not today.
- Not today.
How was she?
What was she wearing?
She was wearing a plaid skirt and gray tights with boots.
Brown boots with...
She was carrying invitations.
Did she have a hat or a schoolbag?
- A white coat with fur.
- She had a braid.
Thank you.
Should we follow her route to school?
Sure.
We could go to the park, ask her friends.
We can go right now.
Yes.
In case she calls.
We'll find her.
We'll find her.
She's always with Benoit, who lives there.
- We'll find her.
- Or in the field in back.
You go here, I'll go there.
She never does this.
She usually calls or...
Does she know people there?
She has friends.
She's always with them.
We'll look over there.
Jasmine?
Roger.
Yes?
Dr. Hamel, stay here!
Dr. Hamel!
Dr. Hamel, stop!
Don't go there, Dr. Hamel.
Don't go there.
Don't go there.
"7 DAYS"
Dr. Hamel?
Detective Sergeant Mercure speaking.
Sorry to bother you at this difficult time.
We think we've found your little girl's murderer.
Murderer?
We have solid material evidence.
Plus we analyzed the DNA of the sperm we found.
It matches the suspect's DNA.
In my opinion, the trial will be a formality.
Hello?
Dr. Hamel?
Step aside, please!
Step aside.
Do you have anything to say?
A new twist in the case of 8-year-old Jasmine Hamel found raped and murdered four days ago.
Already the police have found enough evidence to arrest a prime suspect.
He is a 31 -year-old laborer named Anthony Lemaire, who moved to Drummondville a few months ago.
He'd previously lived in St. Hyacinthe, where he was charged for sexual assault.
He was released for lack of evidence.
But now, in the case of Jasmine Hamel, the evidence seems more conclusive.
How long will he get?
About 15 to 25 years.
25 years.
Where are you going?
The hospital.
Work will do me good.
So soon?
Maybe you should go back to the gallery.
It'll help you forget.
I don't want to forget!
See you tonight.
This isn't for a friendly game of poker.
Not asking questions and keeping your trap shut is part of the contract.
It sounds kind of suspicious.
This is a small town here,
Mister...
I told you, it won't happen here.
How long can I think it over?
20 seconds.
There are other towns, other handymen.
How are you spending your days?
You know, I'm at the hospital.
That's not true.
I called.
I even left messages on your cell.
That's right.
You never listen to messages.
What I'm asking is simple.
For two minutes' work you pocket $10,000.
Think fast.
$5,000 now, $5,000 after.
$20,000, as agreed.
Plus $10,000 a day if you don't talk.
What?
Every day I'll call to say where the money is for a week.
Unless you talk.
If you talk, I'll know.
$10,000 a day?
You can be sure I won't talk.
We won't meet again.
"DAY ONE"
Dan, are you all right?
Wake up! Wake up!
Open your eyes, come on!
- What is it?
- Can I help?
I'm a doctor.
He blacked out.
I don't know what's wrong.
Get him out.
He needs air.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
He just fainted.
Hold him up.
I'll get my bag.
Dan, talk to me!
Open your eyes!
What are we doing here?
Where are we, fuck?
The driver is being questioned.
We located the van.
Your husband drugged him.
The driver lost consciousness.
We don't know how he pulled it off.
What's he trying to do?
We expect to find Lemaire's corpse within a few hours.
No, impossible.
That's not like Bruno.
So you don't know anything?
No.
You said your husband has been out a lot.
I thought he was going...
That he...
That he what?
I don't know.
Do you always know where your wife is?
My wife is dead.
You don't know where he might be hiding?
A hotel, a country place, a cottage?
No.
We wanted to buy something, but we never got very far.
I want you to write down everyone you know.
Relatives, friends, everyone.
We'll question his colleagues at the hospital.
You understand, we have to tap your phone.
Shit!
What's going on?
Why am I tied up like this?
What is this?
You bastard!
What do you want?
What's going on?
What do you want?
Who are you, damn it?
It wasn't me, man!
I swear, it wasn't me.
Wait till my trial, you'll see.
It wasn't me.
Man, look me in the eyes!
It wasn't me, fuck!
I've never seen your daughter.
I didn't do anything!
Untie me, we can talk.
I'll help you.
I'll help you, man.
I'll help you find the real killer.
I hate pedophiles too, just like you!
I hate the bastards!
What are you doing?
What are you gonna do?
Stop fucking around.
Stop joking!
Fuck!
I can't last like this!
You can't do this.
Jesus Christ!
You're sick, fuck.
Shit!
Don't leave me like this.
Fuck you, you sick bastard!
Sick piece of shit!
The security cameras caught this right after Lemaire entered the courthouse.
"DAY TWO"
Have you found out who it is?
We're working on it.
Go to hell!
It wasn't me, shit!
It wasn't me, shit!
Goddammit!
You're committing a major injustice, man.
It's you who'll go to jail, you asshole.
A stunning development in the Jasmine Hamel case.
Her father, Bruno Hamel, is believed to have kidnapped the prime suspect.
We have no other details for now.
If I were Hamel,
I'd cut off his balls.
And make sure he was conscious while I did.
Hello?
Yesterday I wrecked his knee.
That's just the beginning.
It's your turn.
Tell me what to do next.
I want you to stop and come home.
I was hoping you'd understand.
No one approves of what you're doing.
Your family, your friends.
I don't care.
Fuck 'em.
It's for Jasmine.
I owe it to her.
You also think I owe it to her.
I didn't say that.
You also think I owe her a debt.
You have to come home, Bruno.
We'll help each other.
I hoped you'd see.
This is
Detective Sergeant Mercure,
Dr. Hamel.
If you turn yourself in now, the mitigating circumstances...
I'll turn myself in.
Next Friday, my daughter's birthday.
I'm going to kill him.
I'll turn myself in after.
We'll find you before.
I don't think so.
You're not a violent man,
Dr. Hamel.
Not fundamentally.
I know it.
What else do you know?
What you're feeling.
I'd be surprised.
My wife was shot six months ago in a grocery by a young thief for 58 bucks.
Didn't you want to kill him?
Yes.
But I knew it was pointless.
Where is he?
In prison, where he belongs.
And that satisfies you?
At night, lying in your big empty bed, does it console you to know your wife's killer is in jail?
Does it make your life more bearable?
Bye, Sylvie.
The trace failed.
Wait till I get out of here!
Wait till I get out of here, asshole!
"DAY THREE"
Pleau, it's Mercure.
My ring rolled under the door.
Can you get it?
Why don't you do it?
Without my ring, Pleau,
I can't face it.
I put the board back like it was.
Thanks.
Hervé, you should...
A Drummondville electronics salesman recognized Hamel.
The doctor bought $4,000 worth of stuff, including a laptop.
A laptop?
I didn't know why he wanted to get in, I swear.
It only took a minute.
He went in, came out...
I saw Bruno once at the hospital.
I didn't expect him to come to work so soon.
Hamel paid me to crack the van door.
There's not a lock
I can't open.
Surgical instruments, antibiotics, even an artificial respirator.
They all went missing last week.
After he paid me, he sat in the parking lot...
He's such a calm man, so gentle.
I must say,
I find it hard to believe.
You're not gonna charge me.
I learned my lesson.
Besides, I was cool.
I told you everything I know.
It's your turn to be cool.
Seriously,
I have to get to school.
The food's so I last longer?
I'm telling the truth.
Leave me alone.
Want me to confess, is that it?
I did it.
I did it, man!
I confess.
But I'm sorry!
Shit, I'm so sorry.
So sorry!
I don't know why I did it.
I'm sorry, man!
I'm sorry.
I confessed, shit.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I'll say it again to the judge.
I'll be behind bars for years, you can be sure.
I confessed, shit!
Stop! Stop!
I'll go to jail for life.
What more do you want?
I'll do anything you want!
Anything!
All right, to summarize,
Hamel wants to torture the guy undisturbed.
Where does he go?
A cottage?
He doesn't have one.
A motel room?
We'll keep searching, but in a radius of 100 kilometers, there's a shitload of 'em.
A motel's not the place to torture a guy, too many people around.
So back to a cottage.
Did he break into a friend's place?
We checked all the cottages of his colleagues, friends, relatives.
All right.
Maybe he rented one?
That's risky too.
Even if he paid cash, the owner might remember him.
That leaves the abandoned cabin in the woods.
Did he find it by accident?
Did he have it built?
In the woods...
Where?
Christ, we got nothing!
Does it really matter?
After all,
Lemaire's a child rapist.
Why should we bust our ass to save a guy who murders little girls?
It's not Lemaire
I want to save.
"DAY FOUR"
There's no point torturing me.
It won't bring back your little girl.
After you finish me off, what'll you do?
Only three days left till the deadline runs out, and still no sign of Bruno Hamel.
How is the doctor's wife,
Mrs. Sylvie Bérubé, coping with this difficult situation?
Jean Fafard spoke with her.
It's hard.
I have nothing to say.
You don't approve of his actions?
I think...
I think that his grief has driven him mad.
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Bérubé?
In the Middle East...
What made you tell the press
I've gone crazy?
I'm not crazy;
I've never been so lucid.
Come back.
Stop all this.
How can you ask that?
How can you ask that?
If you loved Jasmine, you'd know this is for her.
You're doing it out of guilt.
You finally said it.
You think it's my fault, right?
- It's you who...
- Who what?
You could've gone with her.
But you wanted to fuck!
While you were having your orgasm, your little girl was being raped.
If you'd answered the phone or listened to the message, maybe...
Maybe!
Screw your maybes!
Should we just hide in a corner and cry?
I'm doing something, Sylvie!
They're really going at it.
He was calling from St. Julie.
Trace the call.
He's losing it.
Anyone would lose it if a loved one was murdered.
Fine, but we have to capitalize on it.
Concentrate on cottage rental agencies around St. Julie.
Search every home recently occupied, one by one.
All my life has been marked by violence.
And more of it isn't going to help me.
When I was a kid,
I was abused and beaten.
I know what it is to suffer.
I need help, man!
Help, not more violence!
What's that?
What is it?
Curare?
It's to...
"CURARE: PARALYZES THE MOTOR
SYSTEM BUT NOT CONSClOUSNESS."
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
I can't take it.
You're worse than me.
You're worse than me!
"DAY FlVE"
I figured out what you did.
Fuck your food!
I'm not gonna shit out my stomach again.
So?
What do you got planned now?
How you gonna amuse yourself?
Go on,
I can't wait to see.
Worst thing is, you don't even seem to be enjoying yourself.
Finished already?
Running low on motivation?
I'll help you, okay?
Your daughter wasn't the only one.
Those little sluts...
I killed three others too.
Marion Houle,
Laurie Thibodeau, and Charlotte Masson.
I fucked 'em, and then I killed 'em, all three.
But your little girl,
Jasmine...
She was the best.
She was the prettiest.
Real pretty.
Fucking tease!
The way she was dressed.
She deserved to get her cunt reamed.
While I was fucking her, she kept calling you.
She said,
"Daddy! Daddy!"
Where were you?
Where were you?
Kill me.
Kill me!
Hervé?
It's Hamel on two.
He wants to talk to you.
Yes, Dr. Hamel?
You didn't answer last time.
What was the question?
The fact that your wife's murderer is in prison, does that make life more bearable?
No.
Too bad we didn't talk before.
It's too bad, yeah.
I don't know why I called.
I shouldn't have.
That's not true.
You know why.
I can help you.
You can't even help yourself.
You're drowning, Dr. Hamel.
And you're starting to realize it.
Yeah.
Let me sink.
The trace worked.
We'll be there in two minutes.
Bolduc and his men are already in the area.
How precise is it?
Within 50 meters.
They only need to search a few houses.
Montréal.
No.
We've got the address.
Bolduc's on his way.
Marion Houle.
Charlotte Masson.
Laurie Thibodeau.
Yes.
Yes, Bruno Hamel.
Check the names, you'll see.
Police!
Nobody here.
A remote-controlled computer?
What do you mean?
Where's he calling from?
We're identifying his lSP.
We'll call them.
It shouldn't take long.
Yes.
It's up north in Charette.
He subscribed using a fake name.
Get the local guys in there.
We're at the address.
There's a laptop and a cell phone, but no Hamel.
He's hiding somewhere else.
Hello.
With the gas?
I know who you are.
I'm with you.
Thanks.
You've been looking near Charette.
Because that's where he's hiding.
He called from there, but he may not be there.
"DAY SlX"
He has to be.
He called his wife 15 minutes after seeing her on TV.
In 15 minutes on a dirt road, you can't drive more than 25 kilometers.
Okay.
But it's still a huge area.
There are tons of cottages.
We'll put all our men on it.
We traced all Hamel's calls to the Charette place.
He called TVA TV just before we got there.
Who did he speak to?
We never thought they'd find our little Laurie's killer.
Knowing that Bruno Hamel has him prisoner, we not only approve, we urge him on.
I want you to make him suffer,
Dr. Hamel.
Make him suffer as much as he made my Marion suffer.
One person disagrees, the third victim's mother,
Mrs. Diane Masson, a widow who raised her Charlotte alone in St. Hyacinthe until Anthony Lemaire ruined her life.
I think what Dr. Hamel is doing is pointless.
It won't help him, or me, or anyone.
For me, that man doesn't exist.
That horrible event happened four years ago.
I went on with my life.
I'm all alone, but I'm alive all the same.
St. Hyacinthe.
Yes.
Diane Masson.
What you said on TV is disgusting.
Why did you bring me here?
For you, that man doesn't exist?
We'll see about that.
I don't want to see him!
I don't want to.
I don't want to!
Let me go!
Let me go.
I said let me go!
You bastard!
I don't want to go!
I don't want to see him!
Look at him.
Look at him!
That man doesn't exist?
He doesn't exist?
Look at him.
He doesn't exist?
Go on.
Go ahead.
I know you want to.
Finish him off.
Come on.
Now's the time.
Do it, finish him off!
- Kill him.
- I won't.
- Kill the bastard.
- I won't.
- Kill the fucker!
- No!
Finish him off!
I'll give you time to realize he exists.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
I won't do it, I told you!
Please.
Please, let me out!
Let me out, please.
Please, let me out.
Please.
Let me go.
I'd erased that man from my life.
- You can't.
- Yes, you can.
It's hard, it takes long, but you can.
By bringing me here, you destroyed that.
It's like...
It's like you killed my girl a second time.
Every time you torture that man, you kill your own daughter.
Take me to the police.
Concentrate on waterfront houses by a lake or river.
Forget rental cottages.
Masson's convinced Hamel broke into a private home.
He's using Masson's car, a red Saturn.
We have the license plate.
"DAY SEVEN"
I'll go there.
It's an hour away.
I want to be in Charette when they find him.
Keep me posted.
Call Mercure.
We found him.
Dr. Mercure?
Sergeant Coutu.
We just called the SWAT team.
We'll move in now.
Yeah.
- I don't want...
- He won't just wait for us.
There's been no movement?
Nothing.
Maybe he's still asleep.
Call an ambulance.
Tell them no siren.
Is this Hamel's hideout?
You found him?
Is Lemaire dead?
No comment yet.
Please step back.
Keep those guys far away.
And make sure they keep their mouths shut.
Here we go.
Is he trapped?
He's trapped.
It's her birthday today.
She would have been 9.
Bruno Hamel?
This is Detective Sergeant
Hervé Mercure.
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
Bruno Hamel!
Come out with your hands up.
Drop your gun.
Dr. Bruno Hamel, you are under arrest for kidnapping and attempted murder.
You have a right to immediate legal counsel.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you.
I didn't kill him.
Dr. Hamel?
Do you still think vengeance is the right answer?
No.
So you regret what you've done?
No.

Dan4Jem, MMX
I saw the father and the nun today at the church.
Well, I've done this often.
I love the kids here.
If I have a baby
I should raise him in a place like this.
...because here we have wildflowers and trees to see.
And it's close to Seoul.
Uh? Tow truck?
They said it might take a while to get here. hmm, I love hearing your voice now.
Since I can hear your voice and it's snowing, the ambiance in my car has livened up.
Just a second.
Does your tire have an air leak?
Yes, I called a tow truck.
It'll take a long time to get here since it's snowing.
Let me check your tire.
He said he would check the tire.
Really?
I think you should just wait for the tow truck.
Huh? No, it's not hard to change a tire.
Hmm? It's strange.
You told him you called the tow truck but the guy wants to check your tire.
Wait, wait.
What's the status?
Okay.
Hello? Joo-yeon, I think I should head out now.
Don't open the car door and just wait for the tow truck.
Huh?
Wait.
"My love... so sweet...
I just..."
I, I just don't like him checking the tire even though you told him you called the tow truck.
...Well, there are people around here.
Ha...I'm sorry, I couldn't be with you for your birthday.
Okay. I'll be there soon.
Um.
Your car's completely sunk.
Thank you for your help but I think I should just wait for the tow truck.
Thank you so much.
Why isn't he leaving?
I Saw the Devil
Mister... Mister... Mister...
It's going to be easy since your skin is so soft.
Can you please not kill me?
Why?
I... have a baby in my belly.
Spare my life, please.
Dong-soo! Dong-soo!
What?
Come over here! Hurry Up!
Detective! Why did you come out here?
We can let you know the situation later if you stay at home.
What happened? What happened to my daughter?
Don't look. Not now.
We don't know yet.
Detective Joh.
Here.
Is this...?
Let me see.
It looks like hair. Flip it over.
Forensics team!
Here, here! Come here, hurry!
We found it--we found it over here.
...God helped us.
Otherwise we wouldn't have been able to find her.
It's funny how the father couldn't protect his own daughter, even though he has been a detective in charge of violent crime for over 30 years.
...Please stop smoking sir.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
To you and to my Joo-yeon.
I am terribly sorry.
I'm sorry, Joo-yeon.
I couldn't keep the promise.
I was late and couldn't keep the promise.
But Joo-yeon,
I'll promise this:
I'll give him pain that's a thousand times-- no--ten thousand times worse.
Soo-hyun.
So, how long do you want?
Since there's nothing urgent to do, you can rest for a few months.
Two weeks is enough.
You can rest longer.
No, I'll come back to work after two weeks.
Well, I really appreciate it if you can do that.
But are you going to be okay?
...Alright.
Then I'll be expecting you in two weeks.
In the meantime, please rest yourself fully.
I can't believe this happened to us.
They just got engaged less than a month ago.
What a crazy world.
You're here.
Here's the GPS, and the capsule.
There's a GPS and a voice mic inside here.
Isn't it marvelous?
Good job.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Aren't you going in?
Yes?
Isn't there anything to say?
No.
Well, I trust you but if there's going to be any problem, we could get into serious trouble since I siphoned them off from another division.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure there's no problem.
The police suspect those four.
They were the suspects when there were similar cases before.
Soo-hyun, you're here.
Yeah.
Do you want to have supper?
No, I have to leave now.
I went grocery shopping for dad.
I'll get going now.
Don't see me off outside.
Are you leaving?
Yes.
Why isn't this bastard moving a single muscle?
Yes.
There's no suspicious movement yet.
Yes.
Yes sir.
This guy's the dirtiest pervert, I swear.
Quiet.
Do you remember this?
You really don't know?
I see.
Who the fuck is he?
Why does he look so bruised up?
Why's he turning himself in?
Two months ago, there was a dead teenage girl's body in Bang-Ho river--he said he did that girl.
He confessed that the missing Shin-Chun high school girl a few years ago was his job too.
What the hell is wrong with him?
Why does he have so many bruises?
Who did this? Did you guys do it?
No. All of a sudden paramedics came and went upstairs and found him almost dead like this.
Then who did this? He injured himself?
He didn't explain that part yet.
What the--hey, what happened to you last night?
What the hell is he saying?
It sounds like some guy hit his penis with a hammer badly.
Ahh, that's nonsense.
Hey retard, who hit your penis?
Who the fuck are you?
Hey you motherfucker!
There're no more buses at this time of day.
Where are you going?
Pardon me?
I said, where are you going?
Sungmin apartment.
Sungmin?
Since it's not too far from here, I can give you a ride.
I can take you there.
No thanks.
I can take you there.
It's okay.
Sungmin apartment is very close to here.
It's okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it's okay.
Get in the car.
What?
Yes? Nothing.
Is this an after-school academic bus?
Where did I leave it?
What?
Yes?
Why are you looking so scared?
Haven't you seen this before?
Who are you?
By the way, why do you need these to get the insurance money?
First of all, I need to make sure that your son is my policyholder, Jang Gyeong-chul, since there are many people with the same name.
These are all old pictures.
Maybe you can recognize him in this picture.
I'll ask a few more questions.
Is there any other way to contact him now?
I don't know, but his son might know how to contact him.
Sang-hoon! Sang-hoon!
Where is he?
Yangpyeong? Chungpyeong? I think.
Lastly, I want to make sure your son is the one that I'm looking for.
Is this Jang Gyeong-chul?
He's Gyeong-chul.
Was this picture taken recently?
How come he looks so scary here?
Insurance my ass.
He insured the family?
He left us, and his son, and never came back!
Now you think he has an insurance policy on our names?
That's nonsense!
Why are you saying that?
Am I wrong? Do you still think he's our son?
He's good for nothing!
Please shut your mouth and snap out of it.
Why are you saying that?
It's not appropriate to say stuff like that.
Fuck, whatever.
By the way, if the policyholder is dead or missing, does his family get the money?
Are you Sang-hoon?
Do you know where your father lives now?
Shit. Why do you ask?
You guys don't go anywhere but home now, alright?
Yes.
Driver, please don't let them out anywhere else.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Is Jang Gyeong-chul here?
Why do you ask that?
We're police. Where is he?
He's driving our kids to their homes now.
Can you call him right now? Please?
What? One girl is missing?
What were you guys doing?
How come you guys didn't notice Jang Gyeong-chul leaving the house?
You guys were asleep while staking out, right?
How come you guys missed him?
You're reporting back to me that shit happens?
You guys were all at the front of the house, right?
What were you guys doing there?
Did you guys plan to catch him after greeting him?
What a bunch of retards.
Now listen.
We need to watch every corner of the after-school academy and we must find Jang Gyeong-chul first.
We don't need a fucking warrant.
We just gotta catch him, got it?
Mark my words: he is the murderer.
Go catch him!
It's me.
I just got home to get changed but I don't think I have enough time to get changed now.
So...where are you going?
To my friend's place.
Friend? Who?
Do you know any of my friends?
What?
Do you just want to take the clothes or do you want to get changed now?
No, I don't have time.
Just give me the clothes.
No, I wasn't talking to you.
Why are you going to a friend's place at this time?
To study!
Why are you studying at your friend's place?
Why are you nagging me now?
Are you talking back to me? Come over here!
No!
Look at this girl!
What are you doing now? Hurry up and go.
Let me see.
Ah...your skin is so pale.
It's okay, it's okay.
I'll finish it real quick.
It looks like I can't fucking drive the academic bus anymore.
...Things are getting fucking twisted now.
But shit, can't I like you?
I can like you, right?
It's totally okay that I like you.
Then why the fuck is the whole world giving me so much shit, huh?
Why is that?
I'll finish it real quick.
Jang Gyeong-chul.
What? Are you alone?
Are you a cop?
I see, you're a cop.
How come the Korean police found me so quickly?
I'm so surprised.
I guess you still don't know who I am now.
Well, what do I expect from the Korean police?
That's that.
You shithead!
Fuck you!
What, what the hell is this guy?
This guy's a fucking psycho.
Fucking asshole.
Hello, sir!
I don't know where you're headed, but you can take this taxi.
Aren't you getting in?
There're no more taxis at this time.
How come you decided to walk this road alone?
Well, you're lucky that you got a taxi here.
The customer in the back seat is heading in the same direction.
You're okay going with this gentleman, right?
Sure.
Anyway, it must've been really hard for you to catch a taxi.
You can hardly see a taxi around here at this time.
I rarely even drive here.
Only once in a while, I come here for work.
But you gentlemen are so lucky today.
You know that?
Recently, there've been so many bad incidents around this area that I can't get any customers here.
But today I have two customers here.
Come to think of it, I'm also lucky today!
Ain't I, sir?
Where were you gentlemen going from such a dark place?
Sir? Did something good happen to you today, sir?
Mister.
Yes?
You said we're all lucky today.
That's what I said.
Why?
But I think you're so unlucky today.
Crazy retards.
Your bones will be attached soon since you're young.
Don't worry about it.
How did you break your wrist playing soccer?
Did you play with your fists?
Anyway, from now on take it slowly. Got it?
It's done.
You can leave.
Hey, you motherfucker.
Am I your son?
Then why do you talk down to me?
Take off your glasses.
Take off your glasses.
Come here.
Come over here.
Sir? You can come outside now.
You need to take the prescription.
How old are you?
I'm 22.
Must be nice being 22.
Boyfriend?
Pardon me?
You look like you have many boyfriends. Right?
No. I don't have a boyfriend.
Don't fucking lie to me.
How come a cutie like you don't have a boyfriend?
You don't know about 'IT.'
Excuse me?
If you don't know about 'IT,' then you can hardly know about men.
Yesterday I was going to have some fun, but some asshole spoiled everything.
So this time I want to go smoothly with you.
Take off your clothes.
Huh?
Take off your clothes, yourself.
Since we're going to do it, you should enjoy it too, right?
So take off your clothes.
Take them off before I put scars on your face with my knife, bitch.
I said, take them off quickly, you bitch.
That's right.
Take off your bra too. Hurry up.
Please don't kill me.
That's it. Take off your skirt too.
You son of a bitch.
Who the hell are you, you fucking bitch.
Wait.
Don't leave now.
I need to treat you immediately.
Why are you pretending to be so weak?
It's just the beginning.
Remember this.
It's going to be even more terrible.
Close your eyes now.
Turn around, and cover your ears too.
Hey fuck you, crazy ass motherfucker, shit!
Ha! Son of a bitch!
You want to do this against me, huh?
Hey, you son of a bitch! You really want to do this?!
Crazy motherfucker.
Alright, you fucking shithead, let's see who's the top dog here.
What is it?
Has there been an accident?
Looks like something's wrong with the car.
Yes, sir.
Is everything okay with you?
I'm just worried about you.
The police think that I'm after Jang Gyeong-chul.
It seems like they're also after Jang Gyeong-chul.
So I was wondering.... if you can stop chasing him now.
But I...
You've done enough.
I want you to stop it.
But, sir... never mind.
I see. I'll hang up.
Soo-hyun, it's me.
Soo-hyun.
Yeah, how are you doing?
How are you doing, Soo-hyun?
I'm just busy with my work now.
Really? What kind of work?
You know what I do.
I know what you do normally, but I don't know what you do secretly.
You got the criminal's information from my dad already?
Soo-hyun, I understand how you feel, but I want you to stop it.
My sister won't come back, even if you do this.
Even if you catch him, nothing changes.
Revenge is something people do in a movie, but this man is just crazy.
I'm sorry, but I have nothing to tell you.
What do you mean you have nothing to tell me?
Am I nobody to you?
Do you know how I have been lately?
Recently, I started checking back a lot to see if anyone's following me.
Now you tell me you have nothing to tell me?
So I beg you now.
There's no meaning. Please stop it.
I'm sorry, I have to hang up now.
And this work is not meaningless.
Water.
Give me water.
Do you remember the time when we first met each other?
We wanted to organize a terrorist group and flip the world upside down.
I miss those days.
We got nothing to be afraid of.
...Talk about this crap later when your mom dies, just give me a cigar now.
He must be related to one of the dead girls' families.
Who the hell would do that, if he's not?
He's joined our club, too.
He's enjoying it--the same way you feel excited when you're on the hunt.
Catch it, and release it; catch it, and release it.
He's playing the hunting game now.
It looks like you got caught really bad this time.
This guy went crazy after losing his bitch.
Monster appeared.
It's funny.
Go to bed, you must be tired now.
There are a lot of vacant rooms.
You can sleep in any room.
And I will prepare breakfast for tomorrow.
Fucking assholes.
Let go. Let go of me!
Fuck you, asshole.
Shit, you guys are fucking crazy.
Little bit more, little bit more.
One more time.
He's enjoying it--the same way you feel excited when you're on the hunt.
Catch it, and release it; catch it, and release it.
He's enjoying seeing his prey in pain.
He's playing the hunting game now.
It's going to be even more terrible.
It's fun.
Don't do that.
Didn't you see Mi-yeon last night?
If you resist, it's more painful and takes longer.
It'll be done quickly.
So bear with me for a little bit.
Then why did you suspect us? Huh?
Did we ask for a house or money?
We just wanted to stay here for few days, so why'd you guys give us shit!
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
You should've said that earlier. Huh!
You retards always do that after shit happens.
Wait, wait, the order is arms, legs, and head. Right?
Close your eyes. It's better not to see it.
Where is she?
How did you come inside without making any noise?
I have a baby in my belly.
I was curious how you'd look.
I see you don't look like a monster.
Crazy asshole.
The order is arms, legs and head. Right?
I'll do exactly the same as how you guys did.
Don't worry about it, I won't do any more than that.
You crazy psycho fuckers.
I am actually relieved right now.
I was worried that something might've happened to you.
He's Kim Soo-hyun from NIS (National Intelligence Service), right?
Do you want to see what he's been up to?
Please make him stop.
You can't become a monster to fight against a monster.
You're worried about him too, right?
Where is he now?
You should be okay since I treated you immediately.
You know you both slept for 2 days straight?
What happened?
Why don't you just hand him over to the police?
Not yet.
What are you gonna do?
Do you know how it feels to have a huge lump in your chest?
That feeling...
I promised something to Joo-yeon.
I will pay back what he's done.
Not yet.
It's still far from the end.
Alright. I won't ask you any more.
By the way, the capsule's really good, right? Unless he has constipation...
He was knocked out after I gave him one strong shot.
I don't think he'll wake up until tomorrow.
Soo-hyun, you know you look so different now?
Hello.
Can I have a painkiller with Dexibuprofen in it?
What? Dexi- what?
Give me the strongest one.
Okay.
Where are you now?
It looks like you're not around.
Hey, are you listening? Of course you are.
This is really fun! Huh!?
I've never had this kind of fun before, my whole life.
Hey... I know who you are.
Your girlfriend was Jang Joo-yeon, lived in Yeonyi county. Right?
Am I correct?
I want you to know that you made a mistake.
You underestimated me.
You'll regret that you didn't kill me when you had a chance.
It doesn't even take much time to kill someone.
Hello?
You'll see. I'll teach you how pain really feels.
Hey, excuse me!
By the way, before I killed her, she told me that she was pregnant and begged for her life.
Did you know that?
Hu, hu, hu, hu, hurry up you asshole.
Otherwise, that woman will die.
You should've been around me, since you let me stay alive.
Jang Gyeong-chul. Where did you go?
Shit, do we have to do this to save them?
Sometimes when I look at assholes like them, I don't want to be a human.
Call me when they wake up.
What is this again?
So what?
Really? Is that for real?
I got it.
Hey, Jang Gyeong-chul is turning himself in.
You son of a bitch, you made a mistake.
Wake up.
I want to ask you something.
Where would your friend go?
You shouldn't have got on his nerves.
He pays back what he gets.
Do you know what I mean?
Your girl, your girl's family, huh?
After that, if he turns himself in, it's all done.
But your girl must've not felt so bad.
Unlike me, he gives pleasure before he gives pain.
He gives pleasure first.
Funny? Is that really funny?
That really makes you smile?
Alright, I'll make you smile for the rest of your life.
I wiretapped a call from Jang Gyeong-chul.
I was wiretapping the police communication because I was worried about you.
Just a few moments ago, Jang Gyeong-chul called the police, saying he wants to turn himself in.
But before he does that, he said he wants to finish some business.
Is he gonna do it again?
What location did you wiretap the call from?
Yeonyi County.
Detective Joh?
This is Kim Soo-hyun.
What?
Why did you make things worse and let this happen?
You're a dead man if anything happens to him. Got it!?
Fucking answer me!
Tell the other teams to go to Detective Jang's place, and turn the car around. Hurry up!
Look alike?
No.
Joo-yeon must take after her mom.
Thank god she doesn't take after her dad.
Then why did you charge toward me like crazy?
Are you crazy? Crazy?
Let me see.
Shit, where is it?
What would make that motherfucker get angry?
Would he get mad if I do this?
Like this? Like this? Like this?
Like this, crazy motherfucker, like this, you son of a bitch.
Dad, I'm home.
You can't come inside here.
You can't.
What is it?
Let go of him.
Are you Kim Soo-hyun?
You bastard!
Come over here!
Do you have any idea what you've done? How dare you show up here!
You worthless, crazy...
Let go. Let go of me.
What a ruthless bastard.
Stay out of the way.
Out of the way.
Hello?
This is Jang Gyeong-chul.
You bastard.
Where are you now?
You, you didn't do anything to Sae-yeon. Right?
You can find out later.
What?
Here.
Hello.
How do you feel? Can you feel it now?
Why did you fucking start chasing me, you ignorant fucking asshole.
Who do you think won?
You, or me?
Jang Gyeong-chul, Jang Gyeong-chul!
Jang Gyeong-chul showed up!
Wait for my command.
Now!
Hurry up!
Stop that car! Stop it!
Catch him!
Catch him! Catch him!
Hey!
Yes, you're right.
I was wrong.
I underestimated you.
From now on, I won't go easy on you.
You son of a bitch, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
It's just the beginning.
Why cry like a baby already?
You son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch, kill me already.
Kill me already, son of a bitch.
Kill me now, bitch!
Son of a bitch. Kill me already.
Kill me already, son of a bitch. Kill me already!
No. Not yet. Wait more.
Think about it. If I were going to kill you, I would've already killed you before.
I'll kill you when you are in the most pain.
When you're in the most pain, shivering out of fear-- then, I will kill you.
That's a real revenge.
A real, complete revenge.
Spare, spare my life.
Spare, spare, spare, spare my life.
You heard that a lot, right? "Spare my life."
You must've enjoyed hearing that a lot.
Spare my life. Spare my life.
I'll get punished.
So, so spare my life, I've already had enough.
Since I've already had enough, stop it.
Please, please spare my life.
I'm really sorry.
Please, please spare my life.
Are you scared?
Tell me, now. Are you scared?
Do you realize what you did now?
You've played with me enough, so stop it, son of a bitch.
Hey...stop talking bullshit now.
You lost already.
You think you've played with me till now.
Bullshit.
I don't know what pain is.
Fear? Don't know that either.
There's nothing you can get out of me.
So...you already lost.
You know that?
I wish you'd still feel pain after you die.
Son of a bitch!
Fucking asshole, you're dead!
Crazy bitch! I'll stay alive. I'll fucking stay alive.
You son of a bitch, I will stay alive.
Hey, crazy, can you hear me?
Are you listening to me?
I am afraid of nothing.
You crazy bitch. You think I'm bullshitting, right?
Dad. Dad.
Hey. Hey! Don't open the door!
Dad!
No, no, don't open the door!
Sang-hoon! Don't open the door.
What the hell is he doing over there? Stay out of it.
Don't open the door!
How come it's not opening?
No, no, fuck, why did you come here!?
Mom.
Are you in there?
No. Don't open the door.
Don't fucking open the door, just go home.  Go home!
Gyeong-chul! Gyeong-chul! Gyeong-chul!
Unburden yourself, my son.
I was with General Sherman on his march south.
What we did...
Evil... unspeakable things.
You were a soldier.
You were following orders.
No.
No, not just orders.
We opened a dark door...
And the devil stepped in.
The only way to cast out the devil...
Is to confess to God.
No.
No, I can't, father.
Tell me about Meridian.
How do you know about Meridian?
Hell On Wheels S01E01
"Pilot"
Subs by Mikhel for Subtitulos.es
==SPREAD THE WORD==
A nation which nearly destroyed itself by Civil War between north and south can only be healed by the binding together of east and west.
Mark my words, gentlemen, it will be built.
The only question which remains is...
Which one of you will join me in this mad, noble quest?
Who among you will have to say in years hence that he stood idly by as this nation became an empire?
And who among you will be able to say he lent a hand in making manifest our destiny as a great nation?
Here, here.
Bravo.
It's all horse crap.
The faster I shovel, the faster they eat it up.
But it was a truly inspirational speech.
Twattle and shy, I say.
Then why am I here?
You are here to play your part.
Credit mobilier.
Credit mobilier will be awarded all major construction contracts on the Union Pacific railroad.
I own it.
I'm giving you the chance to get in on the ground floor.
So, you'll be paying yourself to build a railroad with government subsidies.
Now that, my friend, is inspirational.
Yes, it is, but...
I can't afford these on a senator's salary.
As head of the congressional oversight committee on railroads,
I'm sure you will find a way to pay for them over and over and over again.
Might I ask how many shares are here?
200. I think you'll find that's fair.
400 sounds fairer.
Are you trying to renegotiate a bribe?
No. Bribe is such a dirty word. Hmm?
Why don't you think on it, doc, hmm?
Ahem. We've got to vote before the committee next Tuesday.
Good luck with your land speculation in Nebraska.
Oh, 50,000 acres bought on the cheap, hmm?
What would happen to the value of that land if I decided to route the railroad around it?
Take the stocks, Jordan.
But I've decided to renegotiate.
100 shares.
"He was gun... gunned... who... While he paaa...

Prayed.
I... I was getting it.
"Prayed...

Conf...
Conference.
Prayed in the conference?
Confessional.
Someone killed the poor bugger whilst he was confessing?
What is the world coming to, eh?
Well, I suppose the only consolation is that he got to heaven that much faster.
How did you come by that conclusion?
Well, he confessed his sins.
He died in Grace.
So... God just up and punches his ticket to heaven, huh?
Well, yeah.
If that's how God goes about his business, you can keep him.
Keep God?
Do you not believe in a higher power?
Yes, sir, I wear it on my hip.
Are you a gunslinger then?
No.
I was just heading out west, looking for work on the railroad.
Yeah, so are we.
To seek our fortune, as it were.
I'm Mickey and this here's Sean.
Cullen Bohannon.
Mickey has 12 toes.
And Sean but 8.
Individually, we're freaks.
But together, we're whole.
** There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole **
** It's so far from your weapon **

** there's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole **
** you're so far from your weapon and you wanna go home **

Next.
Name?
Cullen Bohannon.
Railroad experience?
None.
Why should I hire you?
I'm willing to do just about anything.
Uh-huh, you and a thousand others.
I ain't got no place else to go, sir.
Save it.
Will you work the cut crew?
Yeah.
Yeah?
What's the cut crew?
Oh, it's brutal work.
It is not for the faint of heart.
It gets hotter than a whore house on nickel night out there.
I ain't afraid of hard work.
You're a Johnny reb, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
I could tell by that griswold you're carrying.
It was a griswold like that that took off my hand.
We all paid a price,
Mr. Bohannon, and I imagine you bare your own scars.
I was a copperhead before the war.
So, I... I bear no hard feelings towards you graybacks.
You did what you had to do.
It's the darkies I blame.
The way I see it, they only fire more than just a hand.
Say, did you own slaves, Mr. Bohannon?
I did.
Well, then... I imagine you know your way around a n.
This is Mr. Bohannon...
Your walking boss.
You can address him as boss or boss man or walking boss.
Mr. Bohannon is a former master of slaves.
Some things don't never change.
So, he's up to your tricks.
He's going to work the blue out of your gums, boys.
Any coffee boilers or otherwise slack work ethic will be dealt with severely.
Now, dig me a cut.
** Pass me not, o gentle savior **
Jesus Christ, accept this humble servant into your heart.
** Hear my humble cry
** while on others thou art calling... ** be reborn...
In the glory of Jesus.
** Do not pass me by
** savior...
Brother Joseph... your sins are washed away.
** Hear my humble cry
** Oh, what a beautiful city
** oh, what a beautiful city
** oh, what a beautiful city
** 12 gates to the city...
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, boy.
** There's 3 gates in the east **
** there's 3 gates in the west ** right here.
** There's 3 gates in the north **
I love the tent.
** And there's 3 gates in the south... ** raise the church.
In this den of thieves,
I shall build a house of the lord.
You putting up a church here?
What better place to convert the wicked, sister.
** Won't you do this kind of favor... ** you better keep an eye on your flock, reverend.
We do our own share of convertin' around here.
** Please tell my mother why have you made my roads so straight?
Are we not in a race with the central pacific?
The central pacific?
Those imbeciles will never make it out of Sacramento.
They're so desperate, I hear they're hiring chinks.
What I was thinking... was something more like... this.
But we're building over a flat land, why wouldn't we make it straight?
Why wouldn't we make it straight he asks?
Take a closer look.
Uh!
Let me elucidate.
In case you haven't heard, this undertaking is being subsidized by the enormous teat of the federal government.
This never-ending, money-gushing nipple pays me
$16,000 per mile, yet, you build my road straight!
You're fired.
Get out.
I said, get out.
You look like a bright young man.
This land...
It's bewitching.
It hasn't changed since Lewis and
Clark first saw it 60 years ago.
Do you ever wonder if our work here will...
Will be the ruin of all of this?
Progress comes with a cost, lily.
I just think it's so much more beautiful without people.
Don't fool yourself.
There are plenty of people here.
We're entering
Cheyenne territory.
You do remember our agreement?
You mean our agreement to regarding my not leaving your side while you were ill?
No.
Ahem.
I mean, our agreement that you should go back to Chicago once we entered hostile Indian territory.
Yes, my dear, but it was before you took ill.
Yeah.
I believe our second agreement supersedes our first.
Oh, dear God, now you sound like a lawyer.
If you want me to go to Chicago... lead the way.
I'm not leaving without you, Robert.
Don't tempt me, lily.
I might just do it.
You play me for dumb.
Ahh, you've worked for this for too long to go back now.
We've worked at this.
This... this would mean nothing to me if you weren't here to share it.
Robert Bell, are you hiding something in your trousers?
It must be all this fresh air.
Mmm.
Mmm. Breathe deeply.
So, uh, how many slaves did you own?
5 in all.
I had me a small tobacco farm.
Any women?
You ever, uh...
Sample the goods?
Uh-uh.
It wasn't like that.
Call.
You, uh... bitter that you had to give up your slaves?
I gave them their freedom a year before the war started.
Are you serious?
I kept them on at wages.
Ha ha.
You are an odd duck,
Bohannon.
I married a northerner.
She convinced me of the evils of slavery.
So, you... you released your slaves, yet you still fought in the war.
Why?
Honor.
The southerner and his honor.
Where is your wife now?
She's dead.
Did the war take her?
Something like that.
Think they heard us?
Who cares?
I don't want to torment the poor bastards out here alone in the middle of nowhere.
They have their hands.
Ohh.
Shh. Shh.
Shh.
I feel this cough is going to be the death of me.
Nonsense.
Nonsense.
Lily... if I were to die...
Robert... please... please don't talk like that.
Don't talk like that.
Oh!
The map.
We have to save their work.
Run to the trees.
Don't look back.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
Uhh!
Uh!
No, please no.
Ah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Robert!
Rise and shine, Bohannon.
It's another beautiful day on the railroad.
Get up!
Uhh.
Get up! Come on!
Whoa.
My horse.
All right, lad.
Half-hour to lunch!
Half-hour!
Peckerwood.
He ain't so bad.
Shut your dumb black ass up.
I don't need no slave boss motivatin' me.
Mm-hmm.
Come on!
Help me out here.
** All them pretty gals gonna be there **
** shuck that corn before you eat ** come on!
Come on!
I say... ** all them pretty gals gonna be there **
** shuck that corn before you eat **
** they gonna fix it for us rare **
** shuck that corn before you eat **
** I know that supper gonna be big **
** shuck that corn before you eat **
** I think I smell a fire roast pig **
** shuck that corn before you eat **
Keep it going.
** I hope they got some whiskey there **
You might want to take a look at this.
Put it in the pile.
No, sir.
You really need to look at this.
Dear God.
Robert Bell is dead?
Is this the entire message?
Yes, sir.
Nothing about...
Maps being found?
No, sir.
One last telegram.
To the Union Pacific board of directors... change of plans.
Stop. Heading for hell on wheels immediately. Stop.
Send it.
You need some water.
No, it ain't... it ain't break time yet.
Come on, you need some water. Come on.
Come on.
Unh.
I thought I told you to dump that dirt on the other side.
Hey.
Shut your mouth.
I told him to do it.
We going to fill in that dip over yonder next.
I figured we might just use some field dirt nearby.
You talk to me before any decisions are made, all right?
Yes, sir, master.
What did you say?
Bohannon, what the hell is going on here?
You drink when
I tell you to drink!
Uh!
Get up!
Willy! Willy! Willy!
Willy!
This is what happens when you break my rules.
Now, what you planning on doing with that Arkansas toothpick, huh?
Don't do it.
We ain't on no plantation no more... walking boss.
Ain't nothing good gonna come from this.
Yeah.
Well, there ain't nothing good coming from this either.
That dumb n actually thought this was gonna changed a thing.
Look what that got him.
Might just as well wipe my ass with it.
You kill him...
You will hang.
How they gonna hang me if there ain't no witnesses?
You come to me with a knife, son...
You better be ready to use it.
Yeah.
You got to let go of the past.
Have you let it go?
You doing quite a trade here.
Not bad for a couple of Irish bumpkins.
Where's Mickey?
He's preparing for the grand finale.
** When you're far away
** far from the land you'll be ** do you not pine for your own homeland, Mr. Bohannon?
No.
And why is that?
It's gone.
** Bright and fair
** and rich in its treasures
** Muldoon
** Won't you come back soon
** love you
So, tell me, Bohannon...
Did you see the elephant during the war?
Yes, I saw my share of action, yeah.
Where?
Yeah. I don't like to talk about it.
I loved the war.
I loved the war!
The best thing that ever happened to me.
I thought you said you were against it?
Oh, yeah, I was.
But... that doesn't mean...
That I didn't enjoy myself once pressed into service.
Hey!
Oh, hey,
I'm... I'm skimped.
No, no. This one's on me.
Well... well, thank you.
Most men shrink...
When they see the elephant up close.
Oh, yeah?
But I... I blossomed.
Thank you.
Though I...
I must admit that there were, um...
Certain lines that I crossed.
Lines of morality that I didn't think myself capable of crossing.
But that's what men do... in war.
Hmm.
Moral men don't.
So, you did nothing that you were ashamed of?
I did plenty I was ashamed of.
You ever been to Meridian,
Mississippi, Mr. Johnson?
That is my remington pointed at your gut.
So... let's take a walk out back.
I know about the 2 men you killed in Maryland.
I read in the paper about Prescott getting killed in that church by a griswold.
But I'll be damned if you didn't show up a few days later with a griswold strapped to your hip as plain as day.
And then you ask me about
Meridian? That's sensitive.
Mmm! I am not proud of what happened to your wife, Bohannon.
It didn't happen to her.
You did it to her.
Yes. Yes, we did it to her.
I did it to her.
Your wife was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I want you to know...
It wasn't my idea to kill her.
She hung herself?
No, she didn't.
The sergeant strangled her and strung her up.
Sergeant?
What sergeant?
Well, he's out here, too.
I figured you were saving him for last.
Oh, you didn't know about it?
You tell me who he is.
Well, it hardly matters now.
No!
Tell me his name.
Tell me his name.
Is it a villain you want?
I'll play the part.
After all, what is a drama without a villain?
What is the building of this grand road if not a drama?
This business is not for the weak of heart.
It's a thorny, brutal affair that rewards the lion for his ferocity.
What of the zebra?
What of the poor zebra?
Well, the zebra's eaten as the zebra should be.
Make no mistake.
Blood will be spilled.
Lives will be lost.
Fortunes will be made.
Men will be ruined.
There will be betrayal and scandal.
A perfidy of epic proportions.
But... the lion shall prevail.
You see, the secret
I know is this...
All of history is driven by the lion.
We drag the poor zebra kicking and braying.
Stain the earth with his cheap blood.
History doesn't remember us fondly, but then history is written by the zebra for the zebra.
100 years hence...
When this railroad spans the continent and America rises to be the greatest power the world has seen...
I will be remembered as a caitiff...
Malefactor...
Who only operated out of greed for personal gain.
All true. All true.
But remember this...
Without me...
And men like me, your glorious railroad would never have been built.

There is a town in Maine...
I'd like a room. Welcome to Storybrooke.
Where every storybook character you've ever known...
Is trapped between two worlds...
An evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here.
And now they don't remember who they are.
Victims of a powerful curse...
Everything you love, everything all of you love, will be taken from you.
That can only be broken by one person.
It's your destiny. You're gonna bring back the happy endings.
You enjoy your stay.

Once Upon A Time S01E02
"The Thing You Love Most"
** Don't be shy **
** just let your feelings roll on by **
** don't wear fear **
** or nobody will know you're there **
** just lift your head **
** and let your feelings out instead **
** and don't be shy **
** just let your feelings roll on by **
** on by, on by **
** on by, on by, on by **
** on by, on by **
** on by, on by ** the missing pages...  where are they?
It's an old book. Stuff's missing.
What do you care?
I care because you think
I am some evil queen.
And that hurts me, Henry.
I am your mother.
No, you're not.
Well, then, who is?
That woman you brought here?
I don't like what she or this book is doing to you.
Thankfully both are no longer an issue.
What?
Hey, how about that?
Guess those rusty old innards finally straightened themselves out, huh?
Yes, how about that, indeed.
Did you know the honey crisp tree is the most vigorous and
Hardy of all apple trees?
It can survive temperatures as low as 40 below and keep growing.
It can weather any storm.
I have one that I've tended to since I was a little girl...
And to this day I have yet to taste anything more delicious than the fruit it offers.
Thanks.
I'm sure you'll enjoy them on your drive home.
Actually, I'm gonna stay for a while.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
Henry has enough issues.
He doesn't need you confusing him.
All due respect, madame Mayor, the fact that you have now threatened me twice in the last 12 hours makes me want to stay more.
Since when were apples a threat?
I can read between the lines.
Sorry. I just want to make sure Henry's okay.
He's fine, dear.
Any problems he has are being taken care of.
What does that mean?
It means I have him in therapy.
It's all under control.
Take my advice, Ms. Swan, only one of us knows what's best for Henry.
Yeah, I'm starting to think you're right about that.
It's time for you to go.
Or what?
Don't underestimate me, Ms. Swan.
You have no idea what I'm capable of.
I shall destroy your happiness...
If it is the last thing I do.
Hey!
Would you like something to drink?
Do I look like I need a drink?
I was only trying to help.
Thank you.
Now that was an awfully big threat.
Destroy everyone's happiness?
How do you plan on accomplishing that?
The dark curse.
Are you sure, your majesty?
You said you'd never use it.
You made a deal when you gave away that curse.
You traded it away.
She won't be happy to see you.
Since when do I care about anyone else's happiness but mine?
Prepare the carriage.
We're going to the forbidden fortress.
How are you, dear?
I'm doing fine.
Are you?
If it were me,
I'd be simply tortured, watching that flake of snow so happy.
Weren't you about the same age when you were to be married before she ruined it all? Yes, you were.
Yes, it was about the same age you were when that sleeping beauty got the best of you, my dear maleficent.
I soldiered on, as you will, too, hopefully.
Enough games. You know why I'm here.
I need my curse back.
It's not yours anymore. A deal's a deal.
I traded you my sleeping curse.
Which failed, undone by a simple kiss.
Now please, return what's mine.
The dark curse? Really?
You must know that not even its unholy power can bring your loved one back from the dead.
Have you considered a pet?
They can be quite comforting.
The only comfort for me is Snow White's suffering.
Well, it's her wedding night.
I doubt she's suffering right now.
I need that curse.
I know you keep it hidden in the orb above your staff.
Hidden for the good of all, old friend.
Whoever created that monstrosity makes the two of us look positively... moral.
Who did give it to you?
Where I got it's none of your concern.
Hand it back.
Must we do this?
Alas, we must.
No!
Love is weakness, maleficent.
I thought you knew that.
If you're going to kill me, kill me.
Why would I do that?
You're my only friend.
Don't do this. This curse... there are lines even we shouldn't cross.
All power comes with a price.
Enacting it will take a terrible toll.
It will leave an emptiness inside you...
A void you will never be able to fill.
So be it.
Who among us is tired of losing?
That's why I called you here...
To put an end to our misery.
Today we claim victory...
And move to a new, better realm...
A place where we can finally win.
And we'll be happy?
I guarantee it.
But first,
I need something from you... a lock of hair from those with the darkest souls.
You must trust me, because if you don't, there are other ways.
A wise decision.
All that remains is the final ingredient...
A prized heart...
From my childhood steed...
The glorious beast whose passing will fuel our victory.
Let my wrath be unleashed.
Yeah, you really unleashed something there.
The "mirror" strikes again.
You're late.
Sorry. I wanted to bring you the latest edition.
I assure you it's one of my better hatchet jobs.
That's not what I asked for.
What'd you find out about her?
Well, the truth be told, there wasn't much.
She spent a lot of time in foster homes.
Uh, she got into some trouble when she was a kid, but the details are locked up pretty tight.
Since then, she's clean.
Bounced around all over.
The only thing I really learned was that she doesn't like to sit still.
That appears to have changed.
Did you know that, um, she had Henry while she was in Phoenix?
How'd he wind up here in Maine?
So if I'm understanding you correctly...
You found nothing of value,
which means you have no value, Sidney.
Do you know what I do with things that hold no value to me?
I throw them away.
I'll keep looking.
Here you go.
Thank you, but I did not order that.
Yeah, I know. You have an admirer.
Ah, so you decided to stay.
Observant...  important for a cop.
It's good news for our tourist business.
It's bad for our local signage.
It's... it's a joke.
Because you ran over our sign.
Look, the cocoa was a nice gesture, and I am impressed that you guessed that I like cinnamon on my chocolate,
'cause most people don't, but I am not here to flirt, so thank you, but no, thank you.
I didn't send it.
I did.
I like cinnamon, too.
Don't you have school?
Duh. I'm 10. Walk me.
So what's the deal with you and your mom?
It's not about us. It's about her curse.
We have to break it.
Luckily, I have a plan.
Step one... identification.
I call it Operation Cobra.
Cobra? That has nothing to do with fairy tales.
Exactly. It's a code name to throw the queen off the trail.
So everyone here is a fairy tale character... they just don't know it?
That's the curse.
Time's been frozen, until you got here.
Hey!
Where'd you get that?
Your mom?
Don't eat that.
O-okay.
Uh, all right, what about their pasts?
They don't know. It's a haze to them.
Ask anyone anything, and you'll see.
So for decades, people have been walking around in a haze, not aging, with screwed-up memories, stuck in a cursed town that kept them oblivious.
I knew you'd get it.
That's why we need you.
You're the only one who can stop her curse.
Because I'm the daughter of
Snow White and Prince Charming... yes, and right now we have the advantage.
My mom doesn't know that.
I took out the end, the part with you in it.
See? Your mom is Snow White.
Oh, kid.
I know the hero never believes at first.
If they did, it wouldn't be a very good story.
If you need proof, take them, read them, but whatever you do, don't let her see these pages.
They're dangerous.
If she finds out who you are...
It would be bad.
I gotta go, but I'll find you later and we can get started.
I knew you'd believe me!
I never said I did.
Why else would you be here?
It's good to see his smile back.
I didn't do anything.
You stayed.
So does the Mayor know you're still here?
Oh, she knows. What is her deal?
She is not a great people person.
How did she get elected?
She's been Mayor as long as I can remember.
No one's ever been brave enough to run against her.
She inspires quite a bit of...
Well, fear.
I'm afraid I only made that worse by giving Henry that book.
Now he thinks she's the evil queen.
Who does he think you are?
Oh. It's silly.
I just got five minutes of silly.
Lay it on me.
Snow White.
Who does he think you are?
I'm not in the book.
Can I ask you a favor?
Regina mentioned the kid's in therapy.
Do you know where I can find the doctor?
Hey.
Emma Swan. I was, uh, just reading about you.
Let me guess... you're here for help with a little post-traumatic stress?
That diagnosis was free, by the way.
No, I'm here about Henry.
I'm sorry. I-I-I really shouldn't...
I know. I'm sorry.
Just tell me something.
This fairy tale obsession... what is causing it?
I mean, he thinks everyone is a character in his book.
That's...
Crazy.
I hope you don't talk that way in front of him.
The word "crazy" is, um, quite damaging. These stories...
They're his language.
He has no idea how to express complex emotions, so he's translating as best he can.
This is how he communicates, and he's using this book to help deal with this problems.
But he got the book a month ago.
Has he been seeing you longer than that?
Um... yes, he has.
So it's Regina, isn't it?
Uh, his mother is a... very complicated woman, and, uh, over the years, her attempts to try and bring Henry closer have only backfired.
Why don't you take a look at the file?
Um, see what I mean.
Why are you doing this?
Well, he talks about you a lot, and you're very important to him.
Thank you.
Just, uh, see that I get it back, okay?
Ms. Swan.
For the sake of the boy, be careful how you handle his belief system.
Destroying his imagination would be... be devastating.
You were right. She was just here.
Did she take the file?
Yes.
How... how did you know she was gonna come here?
Because I'm the one who gave her the idea.
Hey there.
If you're concerned about the
"do not disturb" signs, don't worry. I've left them alone.
Actually, I'm here about
Dr. Archibald Hopper.
He mentioned you got into a bit of a row with him earlier?
No.
I was shocked, too, given your shy, delicate sensibilities.
He says you demanded to see Henry's files and when he refused, you came back and stole them.
He gave them to me.
Alas, he's telling a different tale.
May I check your room, or must I get a search warrant?
Is this what you're looking for?
Well, you're very accommodating.
I'm afraid, Ms. Swan, you're under arrest...
Again.
You know I'm being set up, don't you?
And who, may I ask, is setting you up?
Where carbon dioxide and water synthesize.
May I speak with my son?
We're in the middle of a lesson.
Is it important?
Do you think I'd be here if it wasn't?
Henry, sweetie, I have some bad news.
The woman who you brought here... she's been arrested.
She broke into Dr. Hopper's office and stole his files.
She's a con woman.
She's trying to learn about us in order to take advantage of us.
That's why she's sticking around.
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
I know you think otherwise, but all I'm doing is trying to protect you.
This is gonna be good for us.
You'll see.
Things will be better.
I gotta get back to class.
You know the shrink is lying, right?
To the right, please. Why would he lie?
The Mayor put him up to this.
She's gotta have something on him.
He's terrified of her like everyone else in this...
Town.
To the left.
Regina may be...
A touch intimidating, but I don't think she'd go as far as a frame job.
How far would she go?
What does she have her hands in?
Well, she's the Mayor.
She has her hands in everything.
Including the police force?
Hey.
Henry. Henry, what are you doing here?
His mother told him what happened.
Of course she did.
Henry, I don't know what she said... you're a genius.
What?
I know what you were up to.
You were gathering intel...
For Operation Cobra?
I'm sorry. I'm a bit lost.
It's need-to-know, sheriff, and all you need to know is that Ms. Blanchard's gonna bail her out.
You are?
Why?
I, uh, trust you.
Well, if you can uncuff me,
I have something to do.
What the hell are you doing?
Picking apples.
You're out of your mind.
No, you are, if you think a shoddy frame job's enough to scare me off. You're gonna have to do better than that.
You come after me one more time,
I'm coming back for the rest of this tree.
Because, sister, you have no idea what I'm capable of.
Your move.
Maybe it's for the best.
The forces you're summoning are darker than we can conceive.
Tect me?
It's what I do.
I know.
You're the only one who does.
Helping you is my life.
Well, then help me understand why this curse isn't working.
If you want to know that, then you need to go back to the person who gave it to you in the first place.
Revenge is a dark and lonely road.
Once you go down it...
There is no heading back.
What is there for me to head back to?
It's just us, dearie.
You can show yourself.
Ahh.
That curse you gave me...
It's not working.
Oh, so worried.
So, so worried...
Like snow and her lovely new husband.
What?
They paid me a visit as well.
They were very anxious about you and the curse.
What'd you tell them?
The truth... that nothing can stop the darkness...
Except, of course, their unborn child.
You see, no matter how powerful, all curses can be broken.
Their child is the key.
Of course the curse has to be enacted first.
Tell me what I did wrong.
For that, there's a price.
What do you want?
Simple.
In this new land,
I want comfort.
I want a good life.
Fine. You'll have an estate, be rich.
I wasn't finished. There's more.
There always is with you.
Yeah.
In this new land, should I ever come to you for any reason, you must heed my every request.
You must do whatever I say,
so long as I say...
Please.
You do realize that should I succeed, you won't remember any of this?
Oh, well, then... What's the harm?
Deal.
What must I do to enact this curse?
You need to sacrifice a heart.
I sacrificed my prized steed.
A horse? This is the curse to end all curses.
You think a horse is gonna do?
Great power requires great sacrifice.
The heart you need
must come from something far more precious.
Tell me what will suffice.
The heart of the thing you love most.
What I love most died because of Snow White.
Is there no one else you truly love?
This curse isn't going to be easy.
Vengeance never is, dearie.
You have to ask yourself a simple question... how far are you willing to go?
As far as it takes.
Then please stop wasting everyone's time and just do it.
You know what you love.
Now go kill it.
Ms. Swan.
Oh, my, this is terribly awkward.
I need to ask you to leave.
I'm afraid we have a no-felons rule.
It turns out it's a city ordinance.
Let me guess... the Mayor's office just called to remind you?
You can gather your things, but I need to have your room key back.
She destroyed city property.
I want her arrested.
Again?
What are you waiting for?
I'm just not convinced arresting her's the right plan...
And I'm not talking about your tree.
We both know she didn't steal those files.
Oh, do we? I mean, she looked pretty shocked when I leveled the charges against her.
Guess she doesn't like being caught.
Or because she was set up.
And if she was, that means
Dr. Hopper was lying.
And if he's lying, that means that someone asked him to.
Are we really confident that the man's conscience won't eventually get the best of him?
I think your schoolboy crush is clouding your judgment.
Remember, I made you sheriff, and I can take it away just as easily.
You want me to arrest her again, I will.
Good.
But she's gonna keep coming at you, and I know you... you're gonna keep coming at her and you will do whatever it takes to get her out of here and you may succeed.
No, I will succeed.
He's my son. It's what's best for him.
I know that's what you believe.
Okay? But if this escalates, it seems to me the only one who will get hurt is Henry.
Yeah?
Ms. Swan,
I'd be happy to continue demonstrating my power, but am I right in guessing your resolve to stay is only growing?
You have no idea.
Well, then, I think it's time we made peace.
Why don't you drive over to my office?
Or walk... whatever suits you.
I'd like to start by apologizing,
Ms. Swan.
What?
I just have to accept the reality that you want to be here...
That's right, I do.
And that you're here to take my son from me.
Okay. Let's be clear.
I have no intention of taking him from anyone.
Well, then, what are you doing here?
I know I'm not a mother...
I think that's pretty self-evident... but I did have him, and I can't help it... he got in my head and I want to make sure he's okay.
The more you try to push me out, the more I want to be here, especially after seeing how troubled he is.
You think he's troubled?
Well, he's in therapy, and I only got through a couple pages of his shrink's notes before you had me arrested, but putting all that aside... he thinks everyone in this town is a fairy tale character.
And you don't?
How can I?
The poor kid can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality, and it's only getting worse.
It's crazy.
You think I'm crazy?
Henry.
How long was he there?
Long enough.
You knew he would be here.
Did I know that my son comes to my office every Thursday at precisely 5:00 P.M.
So I can take him for dinner before his therapy session?
Of course I did.
I'm his mother.
Your move.
You have no soul.
How in the hell did you get like this?
What happened? Did you get your answer?
What's going on?
Your majesty?
Your majesty!
Did Rumplestiltskin tell you what you needed to know?
Yes.
And?
I'm not sure I should say.
I'm conflicted.
How bad is it?
Maybe I can help.
I have to cut out the heart of the thing I love most.
Me.
Daddy, I don't know what to do.
My dear...
Please...
You don't have to do this.
I have to do something.
Then move past this.
I know this may sound self-serving, but you don't need to enact the curse.
But I can't keep living like this.
What snow did to me, what she took from me...
It's eating me alive, daddy.
Her very existence mocks me.
She must be punished.
What's...
If the price is a hole that will never be filled, why do it?
Stop worrying about Snow
White and start over.
We can have a new life.
But what kind of life?
All I've worked for, all I've built, will be gone.
My power will disappear.
They already think I'm nothing.
Power is seductive, but so is love, and you can have that again.
I just want to be happy.
You can be. Of this I'm sure.
I believe, given the chance, we can find happiness together.
But the choice is yours.
I think you're right.
I can be happy.
Just not here.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Just wanted to say thank you and, um, pay you back the bail money.
You look like you need to talk.
Cinnamon?
Oh. I'm sorry. I should have asked.
It's a little quirk of mine.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
No, thanks.
When you bailed me out, you said that you trusted me.
Why?
It's strange... ever since you arrived here,
I've had the oddest feeling like we met before.
I mean, I know it's crazy.
I'm starting to reevaluate my definition of crazy.
For what it's worth,
I think you're innocent.
Of breaking and entering or just in general?
Whichever makes you feel better.
Doesn't really matter what anyone thinks I did or didn't do.
I'm leaving.
Thank you for everything, but I think it's for the best.
If I stay, Henry's only gonna keep getting hurt.
What happens if you go?
I think the very fact that you want to leave is why you have to stay.
You care about him.
Who will protect Henry if you won't?
Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?
You know, that umbrella is kind of my good luck charm.
Is that why you think
I'm jiminy cricket?
I don't think you're anyone.
Ms. Swan.
Look, I can explain.
The Mayor forced me...  I know.
Don't worry about it.
I get it. Henry, I'm sorry.
I don't want to talk to you.
Ms. Swan, if she knew you were here... to hell with her.
Henry, there is one simple reason I stayed here... you.
I wanted to get to know you.
You think I'm crazy.
No, I think the curse is crazy, and it is.
But that doesn't mean that it isn't true.
It is a lot to ask anyone to believe in, but there are a lot of crazy things in this world.
So what do I know? Maybe it is true.
But you told my mom... what she needed to hear.
What I do know...
Is that if the curse is real, the only way to break it is by tricking the evil queen...
Into thinking that we are nonbelievers,
'cause that way, she's not on to us.
Isn't that what Operation
Cobra was all about?
Throwing her off the trail?
Brilliant.
I read the pages, and, Henry, you're right... they are dangerous.
There is only one way to make sure that she never sees these.
Now we have the advantage.
I knew you were here to help me.
That's right, kid. I am.
And nothing, not even a curse, is gonna stop that.
I love you, daddy.
What a mess.
Not for long.
What can I do for you, Mr. Gold?
I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd pop by.
Lovely to see you in such high spirits.
Well, it's been a good day.
I just rid the town of an unwanted nuisance.
Emma Swan? Really?
Yes. I imagine she's halfway to Boston by now.
I wouldn't bet on that.
I've just seen her strolling down the main street with your boy.
Thick as thieves, they looked.
What?
Perhaps you should have come to me.
If Ms. Swan is a problem you can't fix,
I'm only too happy to help, for a price, of course.
I'm not in the business of making deals with you anymore.
To which deal are you referring?
You know what deal.
Oh, right, yeah.
The boy I procured for you.
Henry.
Did I ever tell you what a lovely name that was?
How ever did you pick it?
Did you want her to come to town?
You wanted all this to happen, didn't you?
Your finding Henry wasn't an accident, was it?
What ever do you mean?
Where did you get him?
Do you know something?
I've no idea what you're implying.
I think you do.
Who is this woman, his mother, this... Emma Swan?
I would say you think you know exactly who she is.
I really must be going.
Tell me what you know about her.
I'm not gonna answer you, dear, so I suggest you excuse me.
Please.

==SPREAD THE WORD==
Listen to me.
OK, you win.
At least you could stop that song.
You know I hate it.
Why are you so quiet?
Say something!
You're there.
And you're looking at me.
Do you think you can fool me?
No, no, you can't fool me, because I can feel your presence.
And your movements.
I can even smell you.
If you think...
If you think, son of a bitch, that I'll hang myself while you watch, you...
- What's wrong?
- What happened?
Julia, what's wrong?
Julia, can you hear me?
Bring some water.
Take it easy, Julia.
Julia, are you OK?
- What happened?
- She fell.
- Call a doctor, quick!
- No, I'm OK.
I'm OK.
This is Sara. I can't take your call at the moment. Please...
Do you think it's a good idea to show up after six months?
I just need to know that she is all right.
Sara?
Sara?
Maybe they have gone out.
No...
I know something's happened to her.
The power is out.
- The fuses seem to be OK.
- I'll look upstairs.
Sara?
Sara?
Isaac, she's nowhere to be found.
We'll ask the neighbors.
- Don't come down.
- Why?
What's wrong?
Isaac, tell me what's wrong.
- What's wrong?
- Julia...
- What's wrong?
- Come with me.
Inspector...
I'm sorry about what happened.
No, thanks.
The forensics say Sara took her own life last night, during the blackout.
But we need to find out why.
I have been informed that she suffered a degenerative disease.
Yes, a progressive vision loss, the same as my wife.
But Sara went blind a year ago.
And how did she cope with that?
My sister wasn't depressed, if that's what you mean.
In fact, she was...
She was going to have surgery, right?
She was waiting for a donor, but she hoped to get her vision back.
Maybe she got tired of waiting.
All right.
Yes, thank you.
Dr RomÃ¡n can't come to the funeral, and he sends his condolences.
He also wants to check your eyes before you go back home.
Isaac, the power is back.
Darling, are you listening?
And the CD started playing.
Did you hear it?
- Yes.
- Don't you think it's strange that Sara was listening to music before...?
Besides, she hated that song.
- Julia...
- What if she wasn't alone?
- What if she was with somebody?
- Julia, please.
We may never find out her reasons.
We hadn't heard from her in months.
It's strange.
I need to know what happened.
- It's not good for you to get upset.
- I'm not worried about myself.
Well, I am.
Stress can turn you blind.
It's only happened to me twice in five years.
And you've lost 20% of your vision.
Oh, no... Again.
Did you find anything?
Nothing, not even a candle.
- It's time to meet the neighbors.
- OK, hurry up.
Isaac?
Julia.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm Blasco, her next-door neighbor.
I didn't know your sister very well, but Lia loved her very much and she wanted me to bring you this.
Lia?
My daughter.
Sara used to lend her books.
The poor girl is so upset she didn't want to come out of the car.
Anyway...
Sorry... Lia would like to know if Sara left any note.
- We don't know.
- I understand.
Anyway, I won't bother you any longer.
Shall we continue?
Only a neighbor and his daughter?
I didn't know she was so lonely.
But I forgave her.
And I also forgave you.
Now I only need to forgive myself for not being by her side.
But I did everything I could, didn't I, Isaac?
The autopsy doesn't reveal anything strange.
- Have you searched for fingerprints?
- We only found ours and hers.
OK, but...
That song...
And what about what happened in the cemetery?
Julia, there's no evidence of anyone being with your sister.
And nobody has seen or heard anything suspicious.
You can speak with Soledad if you wish.
- With whom?
- An old lady who lives nearby.
Apparently, she helped your sister when she went blind.
Don't be long.
Where does she live?
Follow the rope in the yard.
What rope?
I'm sure the old woman doesn't know anything.
Nobody else knew apart from you.
But you have to speak with your wife.
She'll find out sooner or later.
I'll wait for the right moment.
Mrs Soledad?
Hello?
Who is it?
It's Julia, Sara's sister.
I'll be right out.
Sorry about the mess.
The house must be quite disgusting.
Hello...
- Are you there?
- Yes. Sorry, I didn't know you were...
I am sorry too. I wanted to come to your sister's funeral, but... it took me an hour to find a pair of matching shoes.
It's OK.
Were you a good friend of Sara?
Well, when she started losing her eyesight, a year ago, we used to have long conversations.
But lately she hardly spoke with me.
She had made new friends.
- What new friends?
- You know, younger people.
- From the Baumann Centre.
- Baumann Centre. What's that?
A centre for blind people, not far from here.
One of those places where they make you believe you can live a normal life.
If you can't hear, you are deaf.
If you lost an arm, you are a cripple.
And if you can't see, you are blind.
And nothing can ever be how it used to be.
Mrs Soledad, where can I take a taxi?
Thank you.
Go straight ahead, down the stairs and turn right.
Poor Sara.
- Why would she hang herself?
- Stop thinking about it.
- Shall we have a moment of silence?
- Don't be cruel.
None of us could stand her.
Don't you find it strange?
No.
We've all thought of doing it at some time.
Dela...
Nora is right. I once thought of slitting my wrists.
With candles and opera music.
Me too, I thought of jumping out of the window.
Well, we thought about it but didn't do it.
There's a reason to live.
Maybe Sara didn't find any.
And a boyfriend doesn't seem like a good reason?
Sara had a boyfriend?
She told me she met a boy.
- Who?
- No idea.
They had been going out together for a couple of months.
They even went to Bellavista together for a week.
- What's in Bellavista?
- Rooms for sex.
Quiet!
How weird! Shit!
What is it?
There's someone here.
- I would say it's Sara.
- That's not funny!
- I can smell her too.
- Something is moving.
- I've got her! Call security!
- I'm Sara's sister.
Julia?
Yes.
- Why were you spying on us?
- I just didn't want to interrupt.
- And who is he?
- Who?
- The man who came with you.
- I came alone.
There's someone else here.
A man, and he's right behind you.
Wait!
Who are you?
Turn around.
Turn around.
I said turn around!
No, no!
Isaac?
Isaac?
Hotel Romeo, Bellavista.
What happened to you?
You are soaking wet.
It started raining when I left Soledad's house.
Have you been with her all this time?
She invited me for tea.
I couldn't say no.
Julia, I went to look for you.
You left her place an hour ago.
Where have you been?
Why are you so controlling?
I could also ask you what you're looking for.
Fine.
Fine.
Now I'm certain there was something strange in Sara's suicide.
- There's someone watching us.
- Julia, Julia, please.
Who?
Her boyfriend.
- Sara had a boyfriend?
- Yes.
Who told you?
A group of blind girls told me at the Baumann Centre and someone was spying on us.
- How do you know?
- Because I ran after him.
- You ran after him?
- Yes, I did.
Isaac.
- Isaac! What are you doing?
- We're leaving this house.
Listen to me. If I have to be a controlling husband, I will be.
And if I have to drag you out of here,
I will too.
But I won't let you have a seizure.
You know I would never forgive myself.
Your sister's death has hurt us enough.
You're right.
But I don't feel like going back home.
Why don't we go somewhere, you and me, alone?
Where would you like to go?
- Are you sure you want to stay there?
- The guide says it's the coziest hotel.
Nice view, isn't it?
- Julia.
- Yes, yes. It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Julia...
- I'll park the car.
- Yes, OK.
You don't remember my sister, a blind woman?
Yes, a colleague talked to me about her.
This may sound weird, but could you find out the name of the man who was with her?
- There's no name on the receipt.
- Sorry, but I don't remember any man.
The thing is... my sister is dead, and I need to find this man.
Let me see... I don't understand.
Her booking is not registered.
It's as if all the information was deleted.
- Are you sure?
- Sorry. It must be a computer problem.
You could try El Arlequin. It's the restaurant we recommend to our guests.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I don't understand how they can recommend this restaurant.
I like it.
It's not your style at all.
And that waiter won't stop staring at you.
Really?
- It's your imagination.
- Maybe.
- My reading glasses...
- In your coat? How weird.
I'll go and get them, and I'll go to the toilet too.
If he hits on you, just yell.
What a change!
I like it. It highlights your eyes.
By the way, I knew they were green.
You're confusing me with my twin sister.
She was here last week.
With her boyfriend.
Her boyfriend?
She came with a man, didn't she?
Yes, I think so.
- Do you remember his name?
- No, no idea.
He was very quiet, very sad.
- Could you describe him?
- Sure, he was...
He was very plain, like any other man.
But was he tall, short, blond hair, dark hair?
I can't remember right now.
How can you remember my sister but nothing about the man?
She drew a bit of attention with that blindfold.
Blindfold?
She was bandaged after the operation.
- Did she have an operation?
- Of course.
Hence the bet over her eye color.
She said she'd come once she'd recovered, and if I guessed her eye color,
I could...
- Pablo, can you come for a second?
- Yes, sure.
Excuse me.
My greetings to her.
I couldn't find them.
Let's see how I manage.
Is something wrong?
Sara was here last week.
Julia... what are we doing here?
Isaac, the waiter told me she had her eyes bandaged.
Do you realize?
If she had the operation and had a chance to regain her sight, why would she commit suicide?
Tell me why.
Because the operation didn't work.
What?
It didn't work.
Dr RomÃ¡n told me yesterday.
I was waiting for the right moment to tell you.
That man exists.
Julia, Julia.
- Anything else I should know?
- I was only trying to protect you.
- From what?
- From the truth.
What's the truth?
Sara committed suicide because she couldn't stand being blind.
Julia.
Julia.
Did you know she came here with her boyfriend?
That doesn't prove anything.
And why is he hiding?
Why didn't he show up at the funeral?
Maybe he wasn't with her by then.
Maybe he left her when he found out she'd never recover her sight.
That easy?
That easy, right?
- Well...
- I can't believe you're a psychologist.
Julia!
God!
What are you doing?
Julia, Julia.
Didn't you see the car?
You didn't see it, did you?
How many seizures have you had?
Two.
Shit!
Shit.
If...
- If I go blind... When I go blind...
- No, no. That won't happen.
Not wanting it doesn't mean it won't happen.
Isaac...
One time you told me that...
...when you looked into my eyes, you could see the entire universe.
- I still can.
- What if the universe shuts down?
Close your eyes.
What?
Close your eyes.
Can you see me?
Of course I can't.
Then how do you know
I'm still here with you?
Because I can hear you.
What if I remain silent?
How do you know I'm still here?
I can touch you.
And you can smell me.
And kiss you.
Promise me that when the day comes, we will go back to the desert.
What?
You know?
The last thing I'd like to see is that sky, with you.
- Julia...
- Promise me.
Promise me.
I promise you.
But...
But you have to promise me...
...that you will stop chasing ghosts.
And that we will go and see Dr RomÃ¡n.
Tomorrow.
OK.
I'll bring the luggage to the car.
I'll wait for you outside.
In 15 minutes.
Ms Levin.
Ms Levin.
I'm really sorry for your loss.
My name is CrÃ©spulo.
I read about your sister in the obituaries section of the newspaper.
Thank you.
I have something of hers.
A few hours after your sister left,
I found a key in her room, under the bed.
I think I put it here somewhere.
Thank you.
Mr CrÃ©spulo.
I'm sorry.
Mr CrÃ©spulo...
My sister came here with a man, didn't she?
The invisible man.
I beg your pardon?
Nobody remembers the man who came with your sister, right?
Well...
That doesn't mean he is invisible.
There are people with no light.
Do you know what it's like to walk in somewhere and not be noticed?
Or to walk on the street and have people stumble against you?
Or to ask something for the third time and have no one answer your question?
That's the man you're looking for.
A pause, a vacuum.
An absence.
That's why nobody remembers him.
Nobody except you.
In a way, I am also invisible.
It's been many years since the last time someone remembered me.
This man... do you know where I can find him?
What are you afraid of?
He parked his van in a car park two blocks down the street.
There's a CCTV camera recording 24 hours a day.
Thank you.
Wait!
Be careful.
The man who was with your sister had very angry eyes.
He knows how to be a shadow.
If someone feels invisible and is angry at the world, he can be dangerous.
He has no light.
Nobody looks at him.
He could sneak up on you and...
- Where have you been?
- Did you see anyone?
- I've been waiting for 10 minutes.
- Wait a moment.
He's here.
And I know how to find him.
- No!
- What are you doing?
- Let me talk to the guard.
- Will you calm down?
- Calm down!
- Wait here.
Don't be so rude!
I remind you that you made a promise last night.
- Enough.
- I can't take it anymore!
- I said don't yell at me!
- I've had it!
There's no mystery in Sara's death!
Do you want the footage?
You'll have it.
But this shit ends right here, right now, all right?
You've reached...
Excuse me.
Has anyone been here asking about security videos?
Look... I don't want any trouble, OK?
That guy came, gave me some money and I promised to keep my mouth shut.
He is my husband.
I've been waiting for a while.
Do you know which way he went out?
He left as soon as my little friend made the copies he wanted.
And...
Was there anyone else here?
- Are you sure?
- Nobody.
We can check the monitors in case we see something.
What the hell?
I'll be right back.
Goddammit!
What's wrong?
Calm down. It's me.
Someone has switched off the power.
It's impossible.
It's impossible.
My husband has been kidnapped.
He's in danger.
OK, the only thing we know is that someone stole some CCTV footage.
No, I've already told you.
It was the man who was with my sister.
You have to find him before it's too late.
How can we find someone that nobody has seen, not even you?
CrÃ©spulo.
- He killed him because he was...
- No evidence of violence.
...the only who could recognize the invisible man.
- He's erasing his tracks.
- What do you mean?
My husband is in danger!
- Calm down, madam!
- Isaac!
Call a doctor, quick.
We need a doctor down here.
Isaac.
The process is irreversible.
How long do I have?
I don't know...
Perhaps a few hours, days.
Maybe a few weeks.
Definitely less than a month.
We have to find a donor and operate as soon as possible.
Did you know Sara's boyfriend?
No, I didn't know him.
Julia, I know you're going through a hard time, but you have to think about yourself.
So, please, try to avoid emotional stress.
And don't force your eyes. OK?
IvÃ¡n. IvÃ¡n.
A boyfriend?
Sara never told me about any boyfriends.
She didn't trust men.
Unlike me.
- Or you.
- Isaac hasn't left me, I'm sure.
That's what all women think.
I also came up with a story when my husband left me.
He couldn't stand my son Ã
And my son was more important than anything else.
Then my eyes started to degenerate and I went blind.
Luckily, Ã until I woke up one morning... and he was gone.
My son was gone.
What kind of son abandons a blind mother?
I had to come up with a story.
And I still keep to it.
Such humiliation!
I'm sorry.
Hello?
The hotel is fully automated.
There are no staff.
Guests check in through a machine.
They called from the bank this morning to inform me about a transaction with your husband's credit card.
I searched the room and found this on the bedside table.
Julia, there's things about your husband you don't know.
- He kept Sara's surgery from you.
- To protect me. The doctor told me...
The doctor didn't talk to anybody about the surgery.
How did your husband know?
Inspector, a patrol just drove by
Sara's house and saw light inside.
Isaac?
Wait here. Don't move.
Isaac?
Hello?
Isaac?
Isaac?
Julia!
Shit! I have to get out of here.
Where is it? Stay calm.
Where is the door? Stay calm.
Julia? Julia?
Inspector! There's somebody down here. Inspector!
Julia, calm down. It's me.
There's somebody here.
There's somebody here.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Turn on the torch.
I hate darkness.
Please, say something.
Why aren't you saying anything?
Thank you.
Hi.
There's something you should know, Julia.
Your husband left a letter.
We checked the handwriting and there is no doubt it's his.
Listen...
Sara and Isaac had been lovers for six months.
He apologizes in the letter.
That explains the numerous calls to her we found on his mobile phone.
Did you know they were in touch lately?
Think, Julia.
Did Isaac insist on getting the video?
Probably because he didn't want you to see him on it.
Then he went back to the motel and decided he couldn't live without Sara.
I'm sorry, but everything makes sense.
We found a donor.
We can operate tomorrow.
You just have to sign here.
Thank you.
Calm down, Julia!
Calm down. Sleep a bit more.
OK, Julia... Everything went well.
But we have to be careful now.
You eyes must be protected from the light for two weeks.
And don't manipulate the bandages yourself.
If you remove them too soon, there won't be a solution.
But don't worry, you will be taken care of.
No.
I'd rather go home.
I hate hospitals.
I know, but I'm afraid that's impossible.
- You need supervision.
- I could... go to my sister's house.
I know my way around it very well.
Julia, honestly,
I don't think it's a good idea.
Right, but if I can't see, I can't feel.
All right, let's do this.
You can go to your sister's house.
But a care worker will visit you every day, OK?
Julia, there's something else.
Your husband's body is still here.
I can take care of it if you want.
No.
I'd rather do it myself.
Could you keep the body until I can see again?
I need to say goodbye to him.
Let's sit on the sofa. Slowly.
Keep walking...
- Here are your things.
- Thank you.
- Careful. Don't worry.
- No problem.
Shall we wait here until the care worker arrives?
- Can you do me a favor?
- Sure. What is it?
I'd like to know what this key opens.
Whatever it is this key opens, it's not here.
- Did you try every lock?
- I did.
Do you need anything else?
No, thank you.
- You can go.
- All right.
- Hello?
- Hi.
You must be Julia.
I'm IvÃ¡n, the care worker.
Sorry I'm late. The traffic was bad.
I phoned you, but it got cut off.
I would have preferred a woman.
If you want to call Dr RomÃ¡n...
What happened to your hand?
It's just a scratch. You won't feel anything tomorrow morning.
I will make you dinner and clean up a bit. You stay here.
By the way...
What should I do with the glasses?
Throw them out.
While you ate,
I familiarized myself with the house.
Julia.
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. I have to go.
What time is it?
It's nine o'clock.
On the first days, we lose track of time.
I'll give you a couple of sleeping pills, just in case.
And also a pager.
If you want to contact me, press this button. Give me your hand.
Look, here's the button.
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- I have to put you to bed.
- Sorry, but I can do it myself.
- Are you sure?
Are you OK?
OK, you win.
Put me to bed and then you can go.
Who's there?
Calm down.
Calm down, darling.
It's me.
Isaac?
Isaac?
How can this be?
Don't say anything.
Thank you.
- What are you doing?
- Taking this dirty bandage off.
- So you can see me better.
- No!
That's it, that's it.
Leave me alone.
Get off me! Get off me!
Don't resist, little sister.
We're two against one.
Don't move.
No, stop!
Get off me!
IvÃ¡n. IvÃ¡n.
Julia, is everything OK?
- I think there's someone in the house.
- What?
In the room next door.
- Don't move. I'll call the police.
- No, IvÃ¡n, IvÃ¡n.
Are you still there?
You have to get me out of here right now.
- Where are you?
- In the guest room.
That's good.
Find the door and get out of the room.
Find the door to your right.
- He's there.
- Calm down.
The handrail is in front of you.
Look for it.
OK, yes.
Hold onto the handrail.
Go down the six steps to the first landing.
Then there's nine more.
Julia...
- I'm downstairs. What now?
- Follow the wall to the door.
Who are you?
Who are you?
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Get out of the house! Quick!
There is no indication that someone entered the house.
There was someone there.
And he was looking for something.
Sorry, but there's nothing else
I can do.
- Do you want me to call the hospital?
- Why?
Maybe you shouldn't recover here, considering what you've been through.
You don't believe me either.
I'm just saying that in your situation, it's normal if your senses deceive you.
Don't open your eyes now.
You can let go now.
What's the matter?
My eyes could get damaged, right?
No, I only want to change the bandage, and I took precautions.
I've done this a hundred times.
Don't worry.
You know, when I was 20 years old,
I had a car accident and I was blind for two months.
And like you now,
I imagined things and had nightmares.
And I rejected the care worker's help.
I couldn't stand the idea of going blind.
In the end, I recovered my sight.
But during those months...
...I understood what it was like to live in the dark.
That's why I became a care worker.
You made that up to make me feel better.
No, no. Call the hospital if you don't believe me.
Julia, I know you're scared, but the only way to lose that fear is to fight it.
What do you say?
Will you let me help you?
- What happened?
- You spilled it.
Try to get to the door.
Follow the wall with your hand...
And after the glass cabinet...
Well, I have my ups and downs.
But I slept very well the last few nights.
IvÃ¡n has been very patient with me all week.
Yes, he takes good care of me.
I will. I will, yes.
Thanks a lot for calling. Bye.
- Are you leaving?
- Yes. It's a little late.
Why don't stay a bit longer?
A little while.
- Are you still afraid?
- No.
No, it's not that.
Never mind.
OK, should I make a special dinner for two?
- Go and watch TV. I'll cook.
- That's a little difficult.
Aren't you drinking too much?
I'm celebrating.
What?
That in four days,
I will have the bandages removed and I will see again.
Everything will be all right, Julia.
You know, if the operation doesn't work,
I couldn't complain.
I have seen everything I wanted to see.
What's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?
Funny!
How ironic that you ask me that.
Why?
Because I spent my whole life looking for invisible planets.
My eyes have seen amazing things.
But nothing can compare to the sky in the Sahara.
That's where I met Isaac.
We were on the same excursion and we spent the whole night...
...staring at the sky.
I asked him, "Is that not the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?"
And he said, "Yes."
When I turned my head,
I realized that he'd been watching me for a while and I got nervous.
And I asked him...
..."Why aren't you watching the universe?"
And he said,
"I don't have to look up to do it."
"I can see the universe in your eyes."
And what happened?
I came close.
I touched him.
And I realized that he was nervous too.
In that moment it was as if we became one person.
And I wanted to know if he felt the same.
What did he say?
Nothing.
He replied with his gaze.
Why?
Why did he look at me that way? Why?
- Do you prefer I hadn't done it?
- I don't know.
When you had the affair with Sara,
I thought it was just an indiscretion, but I swear I don't know what to think any more.
I don't know what to think.
Everything will be all right, Julia.
You promise?
I promise.
No, I can't.
I can't do it.
It's not right.
- IvÃ¡n.
- Don't say anything.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Don't say anything.
I'll call the hospital and ask to be replaced.
Is that what you want?
And you?
OK, I'll come back tomorrow and...
If not, just contact me on my pager.
Help! Help!
Help!
Calm down!
I'm Blasco, the neighbor! Lia's father!
Call the police, please!
Calm down!
You need a drink.
No, no.
Call the police, please.
Why do you want to call the police?
To tell another one of your nightmares?
- The last time they didn't believe you.
- No. There was someone by my bed.
I swear, this time it's true.
And what did he want?
To rape you?
It's my daughter.
Don't be afraid.
I told you not to sneak up on people!
Go back to your bed!
And close the door!
Mr Blasco...
Can you call now, please?
Of course, of course.
Don't worry.
How strange.
There's no line.
Calm down.
I'll get the mobile phone.
The mobile is out of battery.
It will take a few minutes to charge.
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down.
What do you say?
Do you want something to drink while we wait?
- What do you say?
- Could I have a glass of water?
- Water?
- Yes, my throat is a bit dry.
Julia, where are you going?
Hey!
Hey!
Madam!
Where are you, madam?
Madam!
Please, pick up.
IvÃ¡n.
Pick up, please.
Julia, what's wrong?
- Julia!
- IvÃ¡n!
- Let's go to your house.
- Not my house.
- Julia, calm down.
- No, my house is not safe.
Please. Take me to your place.
OK.
OK, thanks. Bye.
What did they say?
Inspector Dimas won't be on duty until seven.
You should get some rest and I'll go with you tomorrow morning.
Julia, I won't let anyone hurt you.
You can sleep in my bed.
- And you?
- I have a mattress. I'll be right back.
- No, no.
- I'll be right back. You're safe here.
I'll be back in a minute.
IvÃ¡n?
- Who are you?
- I'm Lia.
- Who are you?
- Lia Blasco.
Don't get close.
How did you find me?
- I followed you. I was Sara's friend.
- I said don't come close.
Listen, my father has nothing to do with all this.
- Your father lied to me.
- My father is lonely, and you're hot.
I don't believe you.
I was the one who took the key and have been spying on you.
- You?
- Do you have nightmares?
- What?
- Sara also had them.
She dreamt of someone taking the bandage off and piercing her eyes with needles.
There's a monster on the street, but no one can see him because he hides in the darkness.
He made Sara go blind and will do the same with you.
- Stop!
- It's him.
I followed him and tried the key.
And today I saw the needles again.
- It's him, Julia. It's the care worker.
- No.
Listen to me!
Do you really think Isaac killed himself? He loved you.
- He loved Sara more.
- They didn't want to worry you.
That's why they kept you in the dark.
Sara told me.
Isaac wrote a suicide note.
Leave me alone.
- The monster forced him to write it.
- Monsters don't exist. Enough!
This one does.
He collects pictures.
His wall is covered with pictures of you and Sara.
- He removed your eyes.
- Lia, that's enough!
Leave me alone!
What are you doing?
Use the key if you don't believe me.
The key. Where's the key?
- He took it.
- No, you took it.
- Why me?
- I don't know. To protect your father.
- It's him. Don't tell him I'm here.
- Lia. Lia.
IvÃ¡n?
Julia, what are you doing?
I'm really nervous.
I'll make you a cup of tea.
It will help you relax.
- IvÃ¡n...
- Yes?
I can't find the key. It's the only evidence to incriminate Blasco.
Did you take it?
- You must have dropped it.
- Please, give it to me.
I'll keep it for you.
You are very nervous.
I'll make you a cup of tea.
You sit down and relax.
He's lying. He had the key.
- We have to get out of here.
- I don't want to.
- You don't believe me now?
- It's impossible. He is a care worker.
Shit! It's locked.
- Julia!
- Yes?
- Do you want sugar?
- Two teaspoons, thanks.
He wants to drug you and make you blind.
What are you saying?
- Can you take this off?
- No. Why?
Then we can't get out of the window.
I need to get the key.
Get rid of him and wait for me in the bathroom.
Here you go.
I'll take you to bed and wait until you fall asleep.
I need to go to the bathroom.
OK.
Thank you.
- Julia, is everything all right?
- Yes. What was that noise?
I don't know. I heard it too.
I thought something had happened to you.
- Hurry up, or your tea will get cold.
- I'll be right out.
Lia, please.
Four days left. Only four days.
Four days, four days.
Julia, I have to go down again.
Are you OK?
Yes, I'll be right out.
Lia.
Lia.
What are you doing here?
Why are you crying?
Please, answer me.
A girl called Lia came to see me.
Blasco's daughter.
And she made me very nervous.
- Why did you take the bandage off?
- I couldn't see anything.
She told me horrible things about you and I was afraid.
About me?
You would never hurt me, would you?
No.
I had to...
I had to see your face to know it.
And what did you see?
Nothing. I can't see anything.
Are you sure you can't see anything?
Sometimes the eyes take time to adjust.
The operation didn't work.
I'm really sorry, Julia.
Probably the girl lied to you in order to protect her father.
Tomorrow... we'll speak with the inspector and all this will be over.
No. No.
No, please.
Take me to the hospital now.
- Now, please.
- We'll call Dr RomÃ¡n.
- Now.
- Julia, listen to me.
Dr RomÃ¡n?
It's IvÃ¡n. Sorry to wake you at this time of night.
I have a problem with Julia Levin.
She took the bandage off by accident.
I understand. I will tell her right now.
Thanks, and sorry to bother you.
What did he say?
He's at a conference.
We can't do anything until next week.
- Then take me to a different hospital.
- No. RomÃ¡n said you have to rest.
- I need a second opinion.
- Julia, the damage is done.
But if you don't do as I say, it will be irreversible.
OK.
Why did you get up?
- The kettle was whistling.
- I'll do it. You sit down.
Be careful.
Very good.
This is nearly ready.
Here you are.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Why are you doing all this, IvÃ¡n?
What do you mean?
Why all this attention?
What do you want from me?
Well, Julia...
When...
When you kissed me...
I didn't expect it.
I didn't expect it, but don't think
I don't like you because... because that's not true.
I only wanted to give you some time.
You've suffered a lot.
And some wounds need to heal.
What I'm trying to say is...
...I want to be with you.
Drink your tea.
Did you put sugar in it?
I'll bring some.
Two teaspoons, right?
As usual.
Done?
Can you come with me, please?
- Why?
- I need your help with the freezer.
Come. Let's go. Leave this here.
Open the freezer.
Why?
Just do it.
Open the freezer, I said.
Liar.
Are you afraid?
You don't know what fear is!
You have no idea what fear is!
Real fear.
Fear of being ignored and rejected.
Look at me. Look at me!
You don't know what it's like to live in the dark and hide in another world.
A world full of silence, getting used to measuring your steps.
Always wearing the appropriate clothes.
Making your voice one voice and none.
And your eyes, two eyes and none.
It takes so long that eventually you become a shadow.
But one day you find out that blind girls realize that you're there, that you're breathing, that you are still alive.
That you can offer them your eyes for theirs, your hands for theirs...
That's why our relationship is so perfect.
That's why...
...we have to continue this way.
If you are not IvÃ¡n, who are you?
Where are you taking me?
My eyes hurt.
Something is wrong.
Take the bandage off, please.
Please.
Please, take it off.
Please, my eyes hurt.
Take the bandage off.
Shut up!
I beg you.
Let me see.
Let me see.
It's started again, right?
This time...
...it will be more intense.
Get out of the car.
You have to pack your bags.
Open the door, Julia.
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!
Open the fucking door!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Who's there?
Is the main door locked?
- Is that you, Julia? You scared me.
- Is it locked?
Yes, of course.
What's wrong?
- There's a murderer in the area.
- A murderer?
We have to call the police.
Where's the phone?
There, in the corner.
Under the painting.
Don't move.
Be quiet.
- What's wrong?
- Don't move.
- It's him. He's here.
- Who?
Don't come any closer, you son of a bitch.
- Who are you talking to?
- To a man who thinks he's invisible.
He made Sara go blind and he wants to do the same to me.
- You're scaring me.
- Stay away.
Soledad, call the police.
- Call the police, quick!
- Don't do it, Mum.
Is that you, son?
Yes.
I'm back home.
This woman says you're chasing her.
This woman is crazy.
- Your son is a murderer.
- Shut up. Don't listen to her, Mum.
- He killed my husband.
- She's lying.
- He killed my husband and Sara too.
- Shut up.
- It must have been easy to hang her.
- I loved Sara.
She killed herself because she wasn't capable of living in darkness.
Capable?
No one is capable of getting used to it.
You made her go blind.
You killed her.
- Is that true, son?
- Mum, mum. You know me.
I said don't move.
Make the call. Make it.
I knew you'd come back.
I knew you'd realize that you can only be happy here.
I told you that without me, you'd be nothing.
Less than nothing.
Invisible.
Since when can you see, Mum?
But you're still my son, and I won't let anybody take you away from me.
Mum, I asked you a question.
Since when can you see?
What are you doing, son? No, no.
No, no.
Calm down, Mum.
- It's me.
- Mum, calm down.
Look, Mum, this liquid attacks the optic nerve without causing any pain.
Don't worry.
And these needles are very useful too.
- Don't do it, please.
- Mum, I have to do it.
- Oh, my boy!
- Don't worry.
What are we doing here?
I won't use it on you.
Your optic nerve must be very damaged by now. It won't take long.
- This can't end like this.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.
Don't worry. When the darkness comes,
I'll be by your side.
I've packed your bags.
We will go far away and nobody will find us.
We will start from scratch.
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me, son of a bitch.
I will never love you. Never.
I would die first.
- Don't touch me!
- Is that what you want?
Don't touch me!
Let go of me!
- Let go of me!
- Come on, do it!
Stay with me.
Do it. Do it.
Do it! Do it!
- Do it.
- I can't! I can't!
Of course you can't.
Although you don't know it... you love me.
Because you know that without me, you are nothing.
And I am only a shadow without you.
Julia, why did you lock the door?
- Hello?
- Inspector. It's Julia.
Julia, it's you.
Listen to me, because this is the last time I'll call you.
- Calm down.
- He's locked me in my house.
- Calm down, Julia.
- He's going to kill me.
If you don't come, it will be too late.
You have to believe me. Please.
- Julia, please, calm down.
- Are you listening to me?
Inspector?
Julia!
Julia, police!
Cover the stairs and the hallway.
Julia, are you there?
It's Dimas. Can you hear me?
- Julia, what are you doing?
- Shut up!
- What's going on?
- I said shut up!
Can you see him?
Can you see him, Inspector?
Police! Put the knife down!
Put your hands above your head!
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me, please.
- Don't look at me!
- Put the knife down!
Put it down!
What are you doing?
Put the knife down!
I will go blind, won't I?
How long do I have?
You'll go blind before dawn.
I need you to do me a favor.
Can we have a moment?
What happened to his eyes?
He donated them.
And where are they?
Where he would have wanted.
Isaac, why?
My God, I miss you so much.
You promised me.
You promised me.
You told me that when you looked into my eyes...
...you could see the entire universe.
I still can.
JULIA'S EYES
What are you doing?
- Where'd I come from?
- Let me down.
- Who knows? Where you been?
- Let me down.
- Please don't take my top off.
- I won't.
- Please, don't.
- I promise. I won't.
I got it.
You're such a perv.
You want it?
- Thanks.
- All right. Here.
This is not a nude beach.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're so going to go get that.
Go get it.
No, I'm gonna get something to eat.
But I'll be back.
You're so bad.
That's a frag.
Here we go. Come on.
Kaboom!
Hey, douchey, why weren't you at the loading bay?
- Are you kidding me?
- No, you were supposed to be flanking.
Just shut up. Respawn and meet me at the dock.
Ooh. Hey everyone, Wonsuk is PMSing on the battlefield again. This is fun.
Gordon, do you think you could maybe just cut it out for a second here?
- I'm trying to...
- Is that friendly fire?
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you from the enemy.
OK, seriously, you're killing me here.
Can you just come over and help me here?
These guys are getting pawned.
Right, playing XBOX that's what's going to pop on my med school application.
Just put the books down and relax for a second.
I can't relax Gordon, all right,
'cause not all of us are on the 7-year graduation program.
Not hearing you, because I just logged you in and you're losing gamer points.
Dude, it took me six months to get those points.
Yes, it did, get involved.
Hey, boys, you shit the bed.
I got a new partner who actually knows how to flank.
So long, boys.
Nick!
Malik?
What...
What's going on, man?
I'm going to beat your bony ass is what's going on.
- Shit.
- The athletic department said you were the best tutor on campus?
Man, you knew I needed a "C" to keep my scholarship.
And without my ride, I'm ghost.
No degree and I'm back living in the 4-1-0.
And I told you about the 4-1-0.
- He did tell you about the 4-1-0.
- OK, thanks, Gordon.
Yeah, come here, Nick.
I don't want to come there.
I said come here, Nick.
B-plus, baby.
- What?
- Yeah, come on, Nick.
- Oh, man! You, you...
- And now I'm going to pay you back.
We are going up to Lake Crosby to celebrate.
Oh, no, I've got, Malik, I, I can't...
I mean, I got my MCAT coming up, a chem final on Monday, I can't...
Shh, shh, shh.
Feel me on this.
We are going to Sara Palski's house.
Sara Palski.
'Sup, baby girl, you ready for the lake?
- Yeah, I can't talk right now, Maya.
- What's his name?
I don't know. I didn't even ask.
I'll be ready in 30 minutes, more like 15 if he knows what he's doing.
You are so bad.
Do me.
- Yo, Nick. Check this out.
- What?
Wow!
Yeah, I'm thinking about doing it this weekend, man.
Grab some wine, build a little fire, drop a knee, and...
...lock her down for good, man.
- Are you snorting steroids?
- We don't need to bring him, by the way.
- I'm just saying...
You're a projected top ten draft pick.
You know? That means, it's like a guaranteed four mil.
You know, that's hot tubs and strip joints, and groupies after every game.
Why you want to handcuff yourself to like, one piece of ass?
- I've got no love for the hos, all right?
- Well, I do.
I have a lot of love for said hos, and I'm gonna need you for that.
He does. He does.
Look, man, Maya was with me when I was poor, all right?
Now she deserves me when I'm ballin'.
All right. You're a disgrace to the modern athlete.
Blake, what up?
What's up, bitches?
'Sup big guy?
Hey, I know you.
Yeah, Intro to Human Portrait last semester.
I had the pleasure of sketching your genitals every Tuesday and Thursday.
Nice. You're welcome.
Hey, boys.
You kids want some candy?
All you got to do is get inside.
- Totally.
- Yep. Yep.
Hey, baby.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Sara.
- Room for one more?
Yeah, totally.
- Threesome.
- Shut up.
If you just wanna...
- Right there's probably no problem.
- Cool.
Good boy. You guys have fun back there.
Not quite what we had in mind there, but...
Nothing like the smell of fish in the morning.
Finally.
- I gotta pee.
- Oh, yo, look at this lake.
- Who is that?
- Good morning, ladies.
- All right.
- Almost as pretty as you, girl.
Just so you guys know, your cell phones are not gonna work out here, so...
...make your calls now.
- OK.
- Oh, God.
- Gross.
- OK, thought of the day.
- OK.
Nick is definitely hot.
What, I am just saying that it might be kind of fun to slaughter his innocence this weekend.
Beth. Just be gentle with that one.
- Maybe start with a...
- Sara.
Beth. Can you start with the rubber handcuffs, OK?
I mean, jeez.
What happened to you hooking up with Blake?
Oh, gross. I told you he spray tans his junk, right?
Last time, I had these stains, like, all over my...
OK. I don't need a play-by-play.
Thank you, Beth.
So you're probably going to have to get her drunk, right?
I mean, she's not gonna let you tickle her privates sober.
Actually, not trying to tickle anyone's privates.
Yeah, but if you're gonna be a doctor, you should probably see a woman naked.
Seen plenty of women naked.
- Cadavers don't count, so...
- OK.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna make her one of your awesome mix-tapes? Those are amazing.
Don't disrespect the mix-tape, OK?
- First of all, your mom loves them.
- That's cute.
And, two, I'm not sure if there's really a connection, even.
OK, I see what's going on here.
You're trying to play it cool and stand back, right?
'Cause you're too much of a puss to step up your game, so meanwhile, somebody else is just going to swoop in and grab that little rabbit.
And I get the pleasure of listening to your vagina cry itself to sleep at night.
It's fun for me all around.
Here, you know what?
Grab that and practice making some babies. It's going to be fun.
All right.
Hey, what's up, man?
I mean, I know you're scared, because, you know, you're hung like a toddler,
- but you'll work it out.
- That's not funny.
That's a sensitive issue there.
What you watching there, guy?
Wow.
OK, you just officially creeped me out, so he's buying.
Just these items.
That's awful sweet of you.
What's that?
Letting the help sit up front like that.
What the hell did you just say?
I could give you English lessons in the back of my truck if you like.
What? What? Say it again.
Give me an English lesson.
Hey.
What's your problem, boy?
What?!
Who you calling boy?
It's about to get gritty right here.
Malik, let's just go.
Try not to mess up my face.
Dennis?
- Sara?
- What's going on here?
It's just a misunderstanding, that's all.
Red's had a few too many today.
My name's Red.
I'm an alcoholic.
Sara Palski.
Wow, look at you.
How's college life?
One more year.
What are you, like, an English major now, or something?
Wait, wait, wait, let me guess...
...psychology.
Well, I got to go.
It was really good seeing you, Dennis.
You too, Sara.
Sweet crew, Sara.
Hey, seriously, Sara, I was this close to putting my foot up Scarface's ass.
I'm sorry. They're harmless.
They're just locals.
It's all ready for you, Sara.
You guys have fun on the island.
Awesome.
Fancy.
Watch out, cooler coming, cooler coming.
Most important part of the trip.
Y'all have fun on the island.
I'm on a boat.
You want to drive the boat?
- Really?
- Yeah, it's insured.
Oh. OK, sure.
No, you're not ready.
Good one. That's funny.
Is it always this hot here?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm hot. And you're hot.
Like... sweatiness.
- I look sweaty?
- Hot. I mean, I'm not, I'm not...
Whoo!
Geronimo!
Sara, what are you doing?
- Sara! Sara, stop!
- Sara!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.
- Nick.
Sara, I think, maybe we should just maybe stop for a second.
OK, OK.
- Slow down!
- He's right behind us.
Well, well, well, little missy.
You should consider yourself...
...still undefeated.
Hey, Sar-bear.
Hey, Sheriff Sabin.
I almost didn't recognize you with the 'stache.
Yeah, it gives me authority, huh?
I got to convince your daddy to buy me one of these buckets to even things up.
So, are these some of your...
Bible class buddies?
Yeah, something like that.
How's the crime fighting business going?
Same old, same old
CSI Lake Crosby, you know.
Excessive noise complaints, salinity measurements, fishing hooks caught in toes, ugly stuff.
So, you animals have fun.
Oh, but first, hey,
Tarzan, why don't you toss me one of them cold ones you got in there?
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.
- Take two, Sheriff.
- Thank you.
Hey, is this how you college kids do it?
- There we go. All right.
- Nice.
- Nice.
- Sheriff's still got it.
I'm going to be dropping by tomorrow.
I told your mama I'd drop the mail off, OK?
Good to see you back again, Sara.
It's been three years too long.
- Thanks, Sheriff.
- Nice meeting you all.
- All right. Sheriff.
- Take care. Be safe.
- We're here, guys.
- OK.
Whoo!
Hey, boys.
It's going to be a good weekend.
So, Dr. Creeper, you want to finish eye-humping Sara
- after we do this thing or what?
- Yeah, no, yeah, sorry, sorry.
But hey, what's her story, anyway?
Is she...
She like hanging out with anybody?
No, man, it's kind of weird. I mean, we've known her for about three years, and never seen her go out on a date.
Not even hook up at a party.
She's just always hanging out with Sherman, the dog.
Come on, come on, come on, go fetch it.
Come on, boy, bring it back.
Good boy, good boy. Come here.
Come here, good boy, good boy, good boy.
Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on, baby.
- The elbow, and the release.
- Oh, it was off.
- Another miss.
- Never going to get this. And yet again.
- Oh, come on.
- You're hopeless. Ready?
- Yeah, I am.
- Honestly, at this point, I'm hopeless.
- You ready for this?
- Yep. Yeah.
- You sure?
Oh, my God. Check out Tan-zilla.
Oh, wait, wait, wait for it, wait, here it comes.
- No, no, he's not going to.
- Yeah.
That's classy.
When are you going to drop the boy toy and saddle up with a real man?
- Really, you got someone in mind?
- Yeah.
I could show you my erotic secrets right on this inflatable beer pong mattress here, huh?
I can make some waves right here.
Looks pretty sturdy. Let's rock it out.
Let's shock the Western World together.
- Oh! Snap.
- Who is the champion of the world?
Be careful, Malik.
Come on, you're talking to Superman, girl.
Crank it up, Nick. Oh, yeah.
Do a trick for me!
Ha, ha, ha! Yeah, baby!
Get them, Malik!
Shit!
- One hand, baby, what's good.
- Did you see that?
Good job, man!
- Hey, let's take him down over there.
- Yeah, OK.
Whoo!
Hey, let's turn around.
- Turning around!
- Let's turn around!
Turning around!
That's my man!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oh!
Ahh!
Oh, my God!
Kid's about to eat it!
Go faster, man, go!
- Faster, baby!
- Go faster, Nick, speed up. Speed up!
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Whoa!
Oh, shit!
- Yo, Nick! Nick, he's down!
- Turn around, Nick.
- What happened?
- He fell.
Good surfing, 'Lika.
- See him?
- Malik!
- Malik!
- Anywhere?
Malik!
- Malik!
- Yo, where the hell is he?
Malik, come on, stop playing!
There he is.
Sara.
Sara.
Beth, Gordon, help!
Hey, what the hell happened?!
Get him up, get him up, get him up!
Put him down right here.
All right, put him down slowly, slowly.
- I'll get the phone.
- Gordon, Gordon, call for help!
- No, there's no reception out here.
- Just try anyway.
We gotta stop the bleeding.
We need a first aid kit.
- Sara, do you have a first aid kit?
- Yes, it's in the house.
Quick, go get it.
- Shit, I'm not getting anything.
- Just keep trying.
- You bastard!
- What did you do?
- You ran over his arm.
- What? No. He fell.
He fell, right? You guys saw him.
I saw him fall, I didn't see his goddamn arm get ripped off!
- All right, calm down.
- Sit down, you little bitch!
- Come on, asshole!
- Stop! It doesn't matter!
Somebody do something, please.
I was just driving around and he fell, you saw him. I just drove.
Nick. You're the only one who knows what to do.
Malik! Malik, can you hear me?
Gordon, I need you to go and get a stick, or like a branch, or something,
- about a foot long and an inch thick, OK?
- OK.
Be careful.
Malik? Malik, can you hear me, man?
- Can you hear me?
- Here.
Be careful.
Constant pressure, OK, keep that pressure on.
Maya, I need you to lift his head up, all right? Keep it elevated, OK?
- It's going to be OK.
- Gordon, give me your phone.
I need the time, need the time.
OK, OK, OK.
Wait, wait, where the hell are you going?!
Nick, Nick, hurry!
Nick! Nick!
Come on!
Holy shit.
- Slowly, slowly.
- It's OK, it's OK.
A shark, man? This is insane.
This is a lake.
- It's a saltwater lake.
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means it's not impossible.
- Think they can save it?
If we find an orthopedic surgeon in the middle of the bayou.
- How much time do we have?
- About two hours.
- How far is the nearest hospital?
- About two hours.
All right, I need everyone off the boat, OK?
Sara's gonna drive and I'm gonna keep Malik stable.
- Everyone else will just slow us down.
- I'm not leaving him.
- Can you guys push us off?
- Put pressure here.
Yeah, we'll send someone back as soon as we can, just hang tight and whatever you do, stay out of the water.
It's going to be OK, Malik.
You're OK.
Don't worry, we're going to save your arm.
Nick.
Maya!
Sara, stop the boat!
Help! Help!
Come on, Maya, swim!
Hang on! Go, Sara, go, go.
Hang on, Maya! Faster, Sara!
Hang on!
Sara, faster!
Maya!
Maya!
Nick! Nick!
What is it?
- What happened?
- The steering is gone!
We've got to slow down!
The throttle is jammed.
I can't stop it!
All right, we've got to bail, OK?
Grab the cooler.
Come on, buddy.
Come on, we got to go.
- Ready?
- Yeah!
Now!
- Oh, my God.
- Move, move, move.
- Oh, my God.
- Easy, easy, easy.
Shit, we got to get someone out here.
I saw a flare in the boathouse.
- Maya's dead. Maya's dead.
- Beth, don't say that.
Don't say that!
- He doesn't need to hear that.
- Calm down.
You need to calm down.
Get me out of here.
Beth, you're not helping anything right now.
- Right now, we all need to stay calm.
- This is a nightmare.
Beth, listen to me, OK?
I know that you're scared, OK?
We're all scared.
This is your fault.
You brought us here.
This is your fault!
Hey, hey, look, guys, just relax.
I'm sorry.
How's Beth?
Threatening to press charges before the Xanax kicked in.
Oh, hold on.
Thanks.
You stay here. Watch him.
Hey!
Hey, Blake, who is it?
Oh.
Well, well, well.
- Hello, boys.
- It's the guys from the bait shop.
That is right, skinny pole.
The guy from the bait shop.
Listen, there's been an accident, we need your help.
Well, what's the matter?
Somebody get hurt playing spin the bottle?
Well, I sure do hope it wasn't my mamacita.
You see, we've got some vacuuming that needs done on our yacht...
Shut your damn mouth, you son of a bitch!
- Put the gun down.
- Easy, Blake. They don't know.
Yeah, Blake, we don't know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa now.
Red.
Blam!
Yeah, college boy, what don't we know?
Her name was Maya and she's dead.
Jesus, love, and Mary, your boy got jacked.
We got to get you all back to shore and down to Manchac's E.R.
- All right, come on.
- No, Manchac's a dump.
They can't handle this kind of trauma.
He's going to sit, waiting to get transferred or else they're going to butcher him even worse.
- We got to get him to St. Francis.
- No, no, we can't move him.
He's lost too much blood already, OK?
I have to keep him stable.
All right, all right.
We'll head to the marina. As soon as we grab a signal, we'll radio the Medevac.
They'll chopper out a surgeon within the hour.
- Who's coming?
- Take me.
- Hey, no, Beth.
- No, no, no.
I'm not staying here any longer.
Let me get my stuff.
Hey, look, are you sure about this, man?
Yeah, OK? Beth is a mess right now.
Yeah, Gordon, you can't.
I'm not going to let her go on that boat alone with swamp thing here. I'm going.
- Hey, you saw what it did to our boat.
- Don't fret there, cupcake.
Ain't nothing to worry about...
...not with this thing.
You see, this here...
...will paralyze anything that swims within 100 yards of this here fine vessel.
We shouldn't see a fin.
Even if we do.
We always got this.
All right, boy. No time to dilly-dally.
Let's get a move on.
Thanks, Dennis.
I owe you.
No. We're good, Sara.
How you feeling, big dog?
Like a one-armed linebacker.
Yeah. We got a doctor coming down here.
He's going to Humpty Dumpty your ass back together, OK?
So...
...if...
...I don't make it...
...I gotta know what she was gonna say.
If she'd still marry half a man.
Well, let's just worry about getting you back together and right, OK?
Yeah. Hey, where's she at?
- Where is she?
- She's, she's...
- She what?
- She's...
She what?
She what?!
Look at me, Blake!
Where's Maya?
I'm so sorry.
Hey, man.
We really appreciate your help.
Now.
You just sit back.
And enjoy the view.
I can't stop seeing her face.
I shouldn't have let her on.
You couldn't have stopped her.
I could have jumped in after her.
Nick, don't play this game.
You can't win and trust me, it never ends.
Why haven't you been back here for three years?
Every summer, all the little rich girls around here would sign up for diving lessons with Dennis Crim.
He was the hot blonde, with sensitive blue eyes.
Some kind of teenage fantasy, I guess.
For two summers, we did everything together.
Then I had to go to college, and he was never going to leave the water, so I broke it off.
So a few days before I was supposed to leave...
...he took me to our favorite diving spot to say goodbye.
We were only down there for a few minutes...
...and suddenly I couldn't breathe.
I figured my air gauge was broken, so I gave him the signal...
...and he just, he just stared at me.
And...
...I reached out to share his air and...
...and he just kind of drifted away.
Jesus.
Somehow I made it to the surface.
And I climbed up to our skiff and...
...I spun around to leave him there and...
...I cut his face open with the propeller.
It was an accident, Sara.
After I took him to the hospital...
...I never went back.
And that was on purpose.
Beth was right, I never should have brought you guys here.
Hey.
It's gonna be OK.
Sara, we're going to be OK.
I really wish I could believe you.
My eyes are up here.
Yeah.
I know where your eyes are, darling.
OK, so why don't we just try to keep this clean, huh?
How big?
Excuse me?
How big?
The shark that got your friend.
How big was it?
I don't know. We didn't see it.
- Must have been a bull.
- Why?
Well, 'cause the bulls, they just wind up in the damnedest places.
Yeah, a couple years back...
...one went all the way upriver, wound up in Missouri.
That's the Show Me state.
Well, how the hell does it get in a lake?
We had a heavy hurricane season this year.
My guess is, maybe one came out of the Gulf, flooded up over the interstate, wound up here...
...got comfortable and made a home.
Or it could have been something else.
Malik.
What are you doing, man?
West Baltimore rules, Nick.
You take one of mine,
I take one of yours.
Malik, don't be crazy.
Get out of the water.
I'm gonna kill it, Nick!
I have to.
No, you don't. Beth and Gordon went for help.
And Maya's dead.
Yeah, I know.
No, no, no, you don't know.
Look, you got a nice GPA and all that, all right?
But you don't know a damn thing about this.
She was my life, man.
She was the only part of me that I couldn't lose.
I'm sorry, Malik.
We boys, all right? We're boys.
But you need to take your ass back inside.
- How you going to find it?
- I'm not.
It's going to find me.
Hey, what's going on?
What's wrong with the engine?
Nothing wrong with the engine.
Well, then, why'd you stop?
We got to get the Medevac out to Malik.
Sit down.
Come on. Sit down.
Five minutes, we're good to go.
Five minutes? Five minutes to what?
Five minutes to show time, darling.
Malik, please, man.
Come on!
Malik!
Come on!
This doesn't feel right.
Why does he have the computer on?
Hey, Buddy. Got any new friend requests?
I'm Gordon79, if you want to stay in touch.
You. On your feet.
- I need some help.
- Me?
- Don't get up.
- It's fine.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to get in the water.
What? No. I'm not going to get in the water.
- In the water, now!
- Calm down.
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Get in the water.
Listen. I can't get in the water.
There's a...
A shark?
- Yeah, I know.
- Who do you think put them there?
Oh, my God.
OK, OK.
Just.
Dennis, please don't make me.
- No!
- You'll get your turn.
- No!
- You'll get your turn, baby.
I told you I'd kill it.
Yeah.
The shark that I saw wasn't a hammerhead.
What?
It swam right past me, and it was a completely different shark.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I just, I don't know how the hell they got in here.
I don't know, during hurricane season they open the floodgates underneath the l-10.
I don't know, all that Gulf water pouring in, maybe they...
...maybe they snuck in somehow.
I don't know.
Or maybe someone put them there.
What the hell is that?
It's a camera.
What?
- I'm taking him across.
- What? What are you talking about?
How fast is your Waverunner?
- Blake, I think we should just wait for...
- No. Look at him!
How much longer did you want to just sit here and wait?
Blake, listen, man, we can't take him back in the water.
I'm not just going to sit here and watch him die, Nick!
Are you guys going to help me, or what?
Who are you freaks?
Isn't that sweet, Red?
She wants to get to know us better.
- Bra and panties.
- Screw you.
Screw both of you.
OK, OK, OK.
Oh, nice.
They going to like them titties.
Oh, yeah.
That's a mighty fine rack of lamb.
Red, I like this one.
No!
Red! Red.
Relax.
Scars build character.
Just a little nibble.
Red.
Do you know how many species of sharks there are?
- No.
- No?
There's 350.
Yeah, that's right.
It's a lot.
I know. I've been diving with them forever.
Bulls, nurses, threshers, lemons.
Hell, I've only seen, how many, now, Red?
Forty-five, as of yesterday, but...
...we went diving this morning.
Guess what we found?
This makes 46.
- I'm sorry about earlier, man.
- Hey, don't worry about it.
We'll hug it out on the other side, just get him across, OK?
Red, pan the camera a little left.
What is that?
It's pretty, huh?
They're called photophores.
That means cells that light up.
- Unique to?
- Isi... Isitoru... Isi...
Isistius brasiliensis.
Isi... exactly.
Or more commonly known as...
...the cookie-cutter shark.
Goodbye, boys.
You know what else is weird about them?
They swallow their own teeth.
That's the only way they can get calcium.
'Cause their normal diet is nothing more than... skin, blubber.
Flesh.
Get me out of here.
Get in there. Get in there tight.
Yeah.
- Get in there.
- All right. All right.
That's it, man.
The end.
- Hey, kids, what's shaking?
- Did the Medevac come?
- Is Malik OK?
- Is he at the hospital?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Slow your roll.
- Wait, nobody sent you?
I saw the bonfire.
What in the hell is that?
Hang in there, buddy, hang in there, Malik.
We're almost there, buddy, hang in there.
Malik, you OK? You with me?
We're almost there, buddy.
I don't give a rat's ass.
Look, tell Fish and Game
I want eyes on that lake yesterday.
And make sure St. Francis has trauma on standby. 10-10.
- Anything?
- We got more boats in the water and Manchac P.D.'s sitting cars on piers, so, we'll find them.
- Nick, are you OK?
- Yeah.
Nick, hey!
- Nick.
- I think he just fainted.
- Come on, let's help him to the couch.
- OK.
Grab his legs.
Not too much longer, buddy, all right?
I'm not taking you with me, Blake.
Malik, no! No!
Malik!
Oh, God! No! No, Malik!
He's sleeping just like a little baby.
All the stress probably just got to him.
Hey, Sar-bear, why don't you do him a favor and go get a really cold towel and we'll bring this boy back to life?
OK. Anything else?
Nope. All I need is right there.
Sherman?
Sherman?
Make it extra special cold, all right, Sar-bear?
What's your 20, Sheriff?
You missed a hell of a happy hour.
Made a blood smoothie out of that tattoo chick.
Now why don't you bring blondie out here so we can have ourselves some fun?
Sheriff.
Sara?
- Sara!
- I'm coming.
I just saved your ass, Greg.
Rock and roll, partner.
You know, if you two could just get past the whole "who tore up whose face" thing, y'all would make an adorable couple.
Why'd you try to run, Sara?
You made it all hard on yourself.
You should have had the soup.
Sweet dreams, baby.
Good shot, partner.
- Where's Nick?
- So that's your type now?
- I bet he's a good listener.
- Where is he?
He's playing with the Sheriff.
Why are you doing this, Dennis?
I'm sorry. I missed that.
Would you mind repeating it in the ear you didn't run over?
It was an accident. I swear to God it was an accident.
I was drowning, OK?
I couldn't breathe.
I was drowning.
But you didn't, Sara.
You sure you were out of air?
'Cause I sure as hell remember waking up in the hospital with my face falling off.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Damn it, Red,
I told you not to bring the dog.
Oh, come on, Dennis.
He just needs a little bit of attention.
- That's right.
- Get rid of him.
- Can we just keep him?
- No, you can't keep him.
- He's so pretty, look at him.
- Get rid of him.
All right.
No.
Oh, you bastard. Sherman.
Tiger sharks.
Also known as requiems.
That ain't too perfect, is it?
Dustbins of the sea, they'll eat anything...
...license plates, tin cans, college pricks.
Oh, yeah, I bet people like to watch that.
Watch?
What are you talking about?
Well, we popped our cherry on that one last month.
This beamed back up to us...
...from an 8-foot thresher we threw in the lake.
What is this?
Well, I know it's not good etiquette, but I'm going to answer your question with a question.
What is cable television's longest running programming event?
Last year alone, it was watched by over 20 million viewers.
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.
Shark Week, loser.
And a few of those 20 million...
...want to watch the real hardcore shit you can't get on basic cable.
And we're willing to bet that they'll pay top dollar for it.
You're sick.
There's no such thing as sickness anymore.
It's all moral relativism. Come on, you remember Faces of Death?
Real killing on tape?
Banned in 40 countries.
An eight-year-old can download it on the Internet today for free, man.
Come on. It's beyond good and evil.
Someone's got to raise the bar.
Here's an interesting factoid for you, Nick.
The cameras that we use are the same ones...
...that they used on March of the Penguins.
You know what would be funny?
To hear Morgan Freeman do a voiceover of you getting your head torn off by that beautiful animal right there.
So what happened, Sara?
I was 18, OK? I was scared...
I didn't know how to handle the situation.
I couldn't even look at myself.
How could I bear to look at you?
Were you scarred on the inside?
God, it's been, it's been three years since...
I haven't been able to come close to another guy.
Please.
I came back here to make it right.
I loved you.
I loved you so much.
I never forgot that, ever.
- Whoa. Hey, easy, now.
- Just shut up!
- Open the goddamn cage, now.
- Easy now.
Shut up!
Easy now.
Bitch!
Carl.
It's almost dawn.
Wake up the big girl.
It's feeding time.
Copy that.
Hundreds of millions of years of evolution perfected these babies.
They can smell a single drop of blood...
...in a body of water the size of an Olympic swimming pool.
No!
You don't have to do this.
Sabin, this can't be worth it!
It's worth it, man. Yeah, it's worth it.
I'm willing to give up my position as lowly janitor on the lake.
I let someone else get shat on by rich college punks for 12 bucks an hour, man,
I see it. Whoo-hoo!
"Retard sheriff."
"I can buy and sell you."
Well, I bought you, Nick.
And I own you.
So now I'm going to sell you.
No. No!
No!
Oh, yeah.
Come on, just pretend it's a carnival.
It's like a big old dunk tank with a twist.
Please.
Oh, yeah...
...psych.
Yeah.
Hey, Nick. You know, you're 15 times more likely to get killed by a falling coconut than a shark?
Fifty times more likely to get crushed by a falling soda machine, man.
Think of it this way, Nick, you're beating some weird-ass odds.
Whoo!
Heavy metal music, man, I'm a fan.
Guilty as charged.
Yeah, I love the old big hair metal.
I'd wear leather pants on the force if they'd let me, but if there's something you'd rather listen to while you're dying, the sheriff takes requests.
How about some Guns and Roses?
What was that?
- Guns and Roses, Sheriff.
- I know what you're trying to do.
You're making me love you. All right!
It's working, yeah! Whoo!
Happens to be my favorite.
Come on, man! Oh, don't, Nick!
Dennis, no, please, you don't have to do this.
Please, no.
We had some good times, Sara.
What are you doing?
What are you going to do?
It's a shame.
Dennis. Dennis, please let me out of here.
- Dennis!
- Bring her up!
- Nick!
- Bring her up.
Come on, Dennis.
Dennis. This ain't funny.
OK. All right.
Hey, Sara, looks like your lucky day.
- Nick.
- Your white knight is here.
You want to play poker, son, you better know what you're holding.
Hang on, Sara.
Nick.
Hold on, Sara.
Behind you.
Nick! Nick!
Sara!
Fuck you!
Sherman.
Sherman, good boy, good boy.
Good boy, Sherman.
Good boy, Sherman.
OK.
Come on, Sara.
Come on, Sara!
Come on, Sara!
Breathe!
Come on!
Come on, come on.
Yes, OK.
Just breathe. It's OK.
It's OK. It's over.
It's over.
Thank you.

The shadow monster woke up.
It saw the boy in the pot and said.
"Mmm. I'm starving."
"I'm going to eat you up."
So the monster opened his mouth wide and... swallowed the little tailor whole.
The boy fell and fell into a dark cave filled with slime...
Is that it?
That's all
I could come up with.
Well, you'll think of something tomorrow.
Let's go to bed.
But I'm not sleepy and I haven't finished it yet.
I know, sweetie, but Mommy's tired from working all day and she needs to sleep.
Here, I'll carry you.
God, you're heavy!
Your story needs an ending.
Let's see if I can help.
Let methink...
Remember the scissors the tailor had given his son?
Well, suddenly he remembered he still had them.
He took them out and started cutting.
Snip, snip, snip...
Snip, snip, snip...
And the monster shouted:
"Ouch!"
"Who's cutting me?"
And the little tailor...
I know, I know!
The boy cuts his way out, makes himself a monster-skin coat and the arrows couldn't hurt him any more.
I'll finish it right now.
You're going to sleep or you'll be tired in the morning.
Mom...
We'll get the little boy out of the monster's belly in the morning.
Don't shut it, Meow is still outside.
He might want to come in.
No dreaming about monsters, okay?
Come!
Come!
Leave her alone, monster!
Let him go!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy, Mommy!
There, there...
It's over, sweetie.
There, there...
The monster came in through the window.
It wanted to take me away.
It was... It had no face.
There's no monster in here.
It was only a nightmare.
It was only a nightmare.
Don't worry.
It's over.
What if he comes back?
If he comes back, close your eyes and count to five.
When you open them, he'll be gone, you'll see.
I'm going to call her.
She is driving me crazy.
I can't stop thinking about her.
Oh, I'm sure Carol would be very happy about that.
Fuck off.
You're not an angel.
Don't tell me you never thought about it.
Listen, mate, I'm very happy with what I've got.
I mean, what could be so wrong with a bit of no-questions-asked, harmless fun with a filthy stranger to spice up your love life?
Just as long as Carol doesn't find out.
And if she does?
I'd deny it, wouldn't you?
Listen, mate, if I were you,
I'd just get it out of the way and tell her everything now.
Fuck off!
Come on!
Keep an eye on Frank.
I have to call my daughter.
She is just very lonely.
She must miss you.
Yes, she does. She misses me very much, but my brother's there, so...
Send them my love.
I will. That's nice of you, thank you.
Yeah, I know, she is old.
Hey, Dad.
Where are you?
Sorry, sweetheart.
I'm still at work.
I'm gonna be another hour.
That's too bad. Grandma made me her famous cake.
Yeah, don't tell me,
chocolate, jam in the middle and fake cream on top.
Is Mum there?
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
Dad wants to talk to you.
Hey, baby.
Yeah. Okay.
Mia, it's so good to see you.
Where is Winnie going?
Yeah? Okay, love you, too. Bye.
Hey, Winnie, where are you?
Winnie, where are you?
Where are you going?
What have you found?
"Hollowface woke up because someone called his name."
"After many, many years, he was free."
"He wasn't young or old, or ugly or handsome."
"He had no shape, he didn't even have a face."
"He remembered a boy with a face that looked like him."
”Hollowface had to find the boy."
"He had to find his face."
"Until one night, Hollowface finally found a face to steal."
“It was a little boy staring out of a window."
”Hollowface wanted the boy's face"
“more than anything else in the world."
"Without a face,"
"he had nothing."
"So he devised a plan."
"First,"
"he'd separate the boy from his parents."
"Then he'd take him back to his lair."
"He'd rip off his face and wear it himself."
"That way, everybody would love him."
"The next night,."
"Hollowface dressed up as a man"
"and went back to the boy's house."
"He ran up the wall quickly."
"He slipped through an open window."
"He found the boy's room and slipped inside."
"The boy was sleeping."
"Hollowface moved closer and closer,"
"and closer."
Continue, Mia.
That's all I have.
You haven't finished it?
I didn't know how to.
It's not bad.
You've hooked your audience and left us with a cliff-hanger.
Try to finish it for next week.
Well, we are all looking forward to finding out what happens next, aren't we?
See you later.
Oh, what time is the party again?
6:00. Don't forget.
Okay, bye!
See you.
Hey!
You're late.
Sorry.
Who is she?
You're sweaty. Come, you have to do the cake.
Hey, birthday girl!
Daddy!
Happy birthday.
It's a teddy bear!
We got you something else, too.
Wow, thanks.
It's so cool!
I've wanted one of them for ages!
Great.
Oh, yes.
You know, it's actually an antique, it's nearly 50 years old.
An old teddy bear. Cool.
I love it, Dad, really.
So, how old are you again?
Nine? Ten?
Dad.
Four?
Okay, guys.
It's time.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Mia.
Happy birthday to you
Whoo!
Hollowface woke up because someone called his name.
After many, many years, he was free.
When Hollowface came out of his lair,
the people looked right through him.
It was like he was in visible.
He saw people in the street, talking and kissing.
And he knew that, without a face, no one could love him.
Hollowface kept hunting for a boy to steal his face.
He looked everywhere, in every window of every house.
Until one night, he found a house with a child inside.
And an open window.
He crept through the rooms
and down the corridor,
where he saw a girl who was still awake.
So he crept closer, and closer.
And he forgot all about hunting for the boy.
Now, Hollowface wanted the girl's face
more than anything else in the world.
So, he devised a plan.
He would hide in the dark corner of her room
and wait for her to go to sleep, and then he would...
I really want one.
One?
Just one.
No.
Yes, just one.
No.
No, don't.
You don't need it.
I do.
That's pathetic.
Mia.
Mia, go to your room.
What is it? What's the matter, sweetheart?
Mia, you've school tomorrow, go.
John.
Come on, it's her birthday.
Are you okay, birthday girl?
I can't sleep.
Too much Coca-Cola?
It's not that.
No? What is it then?
Come on, let's get you into bed.
Oh, I can see you love my present.
Dad, I'm 12 years old.
Did you hear that?
Sorry, mate, I think you should've stayed in the shop.
Looks like she is just a little bit too grown-up for you.
Oh, yeah. She's wearing lipstick and everything.
Come on, you should try to sleep.
Good night, sweetheart.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too.
One, two, three, four, five.
"He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not abide in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
If ye continue in my word, then ye are my disciples indeed.
And ye shall know the truth and the truth will make you free."
Wait for us here.
We can do it here if you like.
You have to say, "Hail,
Mary, full of grace."
Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
When was your last confession?
I don't know.
I don't remember.
That's okay.
Go ahead, tell me.
You needn't be ashamed.
The Lord is good and always forgives us.
Come on.
It can't be that bad.
Come on, Juan.
We're leaving.
No, no, no.
Keep going.
Sorry, mate.
Come on, you.
Concentrate.
You've gotta get all that done by today.
You're the boss.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Please, mate, hurry,
I'm gonna fall!
John, help!
I can't hold on. Come on,
John, hurry up, mate!
Hurry up, I'm gonna fucking let it go.
Hold on!
John!
John! I'm going to fall!
Frank!
Frank! Frank!
- Dad?
- Jesus.
You scared the life out of me!
Are you okay, sweetheart?
What's the matter?
I had a nightmare.
What was it about?
Come, Mia.
Come on, let's go back to bed.
You have school tomorrow.
What if the nightmare comes back?
Come on.
Dad, where are we going?
Come on, it's fine.
Shit.
Dad.
Why are you standing out there? Come on.
What are you doing?
Yes, got it.
Do you remember this?
The anti-nightmare book!
Dad, this is ridiculous.
Come on. Come and sit down.
Haven't read this in ages.
Come on.
Now, which one shall we read?
That one.
This one?
Okay. So...
"if a big red devil with big teeth and claws comes to you"
"and tries to squeeze you in its jaws, just light it up and say..."
Dad.
Oh, you're too grown... "Boo!"
"And you'll see it's just a shadow and you can see it through."
See, monsters are cowards.
If you stand up to them, they run away.
Not this one.
This one's different.
They're all the same.
All cowards.
And you know they'd never dare come into this house if they know I'm here.
But he's already inside.
What do you mean?
Where?
I don't know.
I think he spies on me when I'm asleep.
I know he's there.
Right.
Now, to kill a monster, you have to enter their story.
See, they think you're gonna run away, but if you enter their story, they're screwed.
So...
Now, there's something missing.
Ah! Perfect.
Wow! There he is.
There's our monster.
So, you think you're scary, huh?
Now, listen, mate.
It's the end of the road.
We've had enough.
You cannot keep bothering my daughter at night.
Okay, stand back.
Whoa.
Look at him go.
Wow.
Basketball face, go.
Look at his face.
Ooh.
Spooky.
He looks so angry.
What the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?
What is this?
Mia, go to your room.
It's all right.
We were just playing.
What do you mean "playing"? You could have burned the house down.
She had a nightmare.
We were just getting rid of it.
What do you mean
"getting rid of it"?
What do you mean?
What is this?
Sue. It was a game.
Throw this thing away before it stinks up the whole house.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Juan...
It's okay, sweetie.
There, there.
It's over.
Please, come in.
Juan.
Juan.
Father Antonio is here to see you.
He doesn't seem to have a fever.
Hi, Juan.
My name is Antonio.
Do you remember me?
Look.
I brought your toy.
I'll leave it here, okay?
Your mother says you're having trouble sleeping.
Go away.
Why do you say that?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I had nightmares at your age too.
They aren't nightmares.
What are you scared of?
Witches?
No such thing.
And the bogeyman isn't real either.
My parents told me about him so I'd finish my dinner.
It's just a story.
You needn't be afraid of stories.
Here's what we'll do:
You tell me what you're scared of, and I'll tell you what scares me, okay?
I have a friend I talk to every day who I can't see.
I'm scared... my friend won't answer me.
That I'll talk to him and he won't say anything.
Now it's your turn.
What are you scared of?
Hollowface.
Who is Hollowface?
Mia, what's the matter?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Tell me.
He's here.
He's inside.
No, come on, sweetheart.
There's nobody here, it's just you and me.
Look.
Daddy, look.
Mia, get out.
Get out!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Help me!
John!
- John, what's going on?
- Call the police!
Call the police!
Please.
Just let her go.
Don't hurt her.
My God! Sweetheart, are you okay?
Are you okay?
What's going on?
There was a fucking man in the room.
Are you okay?
Are you Okay? Baby...
It's okay, it's okay.
Awful business.
I think he must've come in through the window.
I chased after him, but he'd gone.
Did you see his face? Could you give us a description?
It was dark.
He had a hood on.
Get that to forensics, George.
Now, once an intruder has been seen, he very rarely comes back.
We'll get him.
Don't worry, Mr Farrow.
Thank you.
He said not to worry. He said he definitely won't come back.
It's okay.
You sit down here, lovely.
Has she said anything?
What do you want her to say?
She's terrified.
Are you okay?
What is it, sweetheart?
Talk to me.
Mia.
Talk to me.
Sweetheart, tell me what's wrong.
Mia.
Sweetheart, what is it?
One, two, three, four...
Mommy, Mommy!
Juan...
How are you?
Everything okay?
No wonder the father ran off.
Did she tell you that?
No.
She speaks only of a presence, that there's something inside the boy.
They're both nuts, the boy and the mother.
They would spook anyone.
She told you more than she told me.
You don't know how to treat women.
Will you help them?
What do you want me to do?
I don't know. Make them think you got rid of it.
Got rid of what?
We're talking about something very serious.
It wouldn't have to be official.
It would be like a placebo.
Antonio, you can't perform such a serious ritual just to settle the nerves of a crazy woman.
No matter how pretty she is.
You can't play around with this stuff, damn it.
Leave them alone.
This is a job for a psychiatrist, not for us.
And then he leapt from your window?
Oh, Mia. I'm sorry.
What a terrible thing to go through, it must be terrifying!
And you haven't been able to speak ever since?
Or you haven't wanted to?
Things and...
It's important I know.
You can't.
You know, it's all right to be afraid.
I get scared too sometimes.
Everyone does.
Please, come with me.
As there's nothing physically preventing your daughter from speaking, her silence is an acute emotional response to the severe shock she experienced.
So what do we do?
Oh, you have to be patient.
Should she keep going to school?
Oh, yes, absolutely.
You don't want to disrupt her routine, but I will need to see Mia every day.
Every day?
Mr Farrow,
I'm sure you want to avoid
Mia re-living the experience through flashbacks or recurring nightmares.
We want to facilitate the successful, emotional processing of the trauma through basic counseling.
During the sessions, Mia will confront her fears.
We've found the method to be extremely effective for the children...
Hollowface did not give up.
He would wait for the right moment to rip off the girl's face.
Hollowface crept closer, and closer and closer.
You haven't got one that's a bit quieter?
Quieter?
Wouldn't have a Chihuahua as a guard dog, would you?
This is a Rottweiler.
It's an excellent choice.
Complete security package.
No more worries.
How about...
I made you something to eat.
You're doing your homework?
Listen, Mia, you don't have to do it if you don't want to.
"Want to." Okay.
Come, come here.
Come here. Sit.
You can only access the images on the central Web site with a password.
It's very secure.
Yes, hi, mate, yeah. I need to enter a password for a customer.
Name, John Farrow.
Yep.
One, nine, six, seven.
Hi, Juan.
How are you?
Remember me?
Juan.
Juan.
Mommy, I'm having fun!
We're leaving.
We can't be here.
Let's go.
Come on.
Juan...
Hollowface crept closer, and closer.
The girl knew that
Hollowface was there.
She could feel him watching her.
She wanted to scream for help,
but when she opened her mouth she couldn't make a sound.
Her parents couldn't keep her safe
because Hollowface was already inside.
He'd made a new lair right in her room,
in a dark corner everyone had forgotten about.
His new lair was big enough for both of them.
Hollowface would drag the girl into his lair
and keep her there in the dark,
imprison her, away from her parents, forever.
Then she wouldn't need her face ever again.
He started calling her to his lair.
She felt his claws reaching out to her.
John!
Mia, are you okay?
Are you okay?
She's fine now. Her blood pressure is very low.
She needs to rest.
We're going to run some allergy tests.
Anaphylactic shock is a severe hypersensitivity body reaction, but I don't want you to worry, Mrs Farrow, we will find what triggered it.
In the meantime,
I'm gonna prescribe some intravenous adrenaline and sedatives in case of emergency.
If she loses consciousness and the ambulance takes too long, you can inject it yourself.
It takes only a couple of seconds to take effect.
I'll have a nurse show you how it works.
Okay. Thank you.
I'll go get a nurse.
Could you give us a description?
Yeah, he looked really weird.
It was like...
It was like he was deformed.
Deformed?
But it's a good job you installed those security cameras.
I'll have one of my men check the coverage.
But we'll need your password.
Yeah, of course.
Sorry, would you excuse me?
Hey, how is she?
She's all right.
She's all right.
It's Dave.
Please, take him. He's been calling the whole time.
Hello?
Mrs Farrow, can you tell me what happened tonight?
I'm calling because your mother asked me to.
Your mother wants us to be...
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.
I'm taking care of the situation.
She is worried about Mia.
How is she, John?
I didn't see him I just...
John?
Dave, I can't talk right now.
Sorry, I've gotta go.
Dave, how are they?
They'll be fine.
Sit down.
Come with me, Juan.
Lie down.
We're going to pray together.
I'm going to say a prayer and repeat after me, all right?
Mommy says you're going to make Hollowface go away.
That's right.
Jesus will come, he'll grab Hollowface and poof.
He'll throw him into a pit so deep he'll never get out.
But Hollowface can fly.
Juan, keep quiet and obey the father.
Cross yourselves.
Give me your hand.
"You, Lord, are my refuge.
He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence."
Repeat it.
"You, Lord, are my refuge.
He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome..."
"From the noisome pestilence."
"From the noisome pestilence."
"Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flaith by day."
Juan.
Please.
I don't want to.
That's all right.
We'll try something else.
I'll pray and you repeat it to yourself in silence.
Close your eyes.
"Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flaith by day."
I can't.
I can't do it.
I can't expel him if I don't know who he is.
You know who he is, don't you?
He has no face.
His face is hidden.
I can't see it.
You can't see it because he's wearing a hood, right?
Close your eyes.
Try to imagine his face.
Take it off.
Take off his hood.
Father, that's enough.
Good, Juan.
Good.
He's there.
Where, Juan?
There.
Where is he?
There's nothing there.
What do you see?
He's gone.
It's only a statue.
Luisa.
You can't help us.
There's nothing you can do.
It's only a statue.
You imagined the whole thing.
Luisa!
Luisa...
Tell me what you saw.
Mommy, where are we going?
I don't know.
Far away.
Juan, help me.
Close your suitcase.
Do you think he'll follow us?
No, because we're going far away.
Do you understand?
You saw him too, didn't you?
Juan, I didn't see anything.
You hear me?
Nothing.
What's going on?
Good morning, John.
Come through.
Is everything okay?
Sue, where's Mia?
Is she okay?
She's here, John.
She'll be fine.
Hello, John.
What is this?
Please, John, take a seat.
Mia knows that she has the full love and support of both her parents, especially you, John.
You have a very special bond with her.
I should hope so,
I'm her father.
Susanna tells me that you haven't slept well since your incident at work.
Well, I think we've all had trouble sleeping ever since a man started appearing in my daughter's bedroom at night.
I understand.
John, there is a very rare syndrome, which is often brought on by stress, which occurs when two people's psyches become entwined.
It's a shared disorder, called "folie à deux."
When two people with close emotional ties share the same hallucination.
Hallucination?
There's no intruder, John.
It's in your imagination and in Mia's.
What the fuck are you talking about?
John, I'd like you to look at this, please.
Play that again.
What is this?
There was no one there, John.
Nobody else in the room, but you and your daughter.
Mr Farrow.
Who the fuck are you?
This is David Wareton from Social Services.
We're all here to help you, John.
The condition can be treated very successfully through therapy, but, John, the first step will be to separate you from Mia for awhile.
If you have nowhere else to go, we can help you out with that.
I recommend that you speak to my colleague, Dr Nowinski.
He said he'll treat you.
This is ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense.
I was in the fucking room!
He was there, he was attacking my daughter.
Sue, you were there, tell them.
Sue.
Tell them!
Mr Farrow, you need to calm down.
I didn't see anything.
You saw the video.
There's nobody there.
I don't fucking believe you.
So you think
I'm crazy, do you?
Don't worry.
By the time you get home,
I'll be out.
Mia, when we get home,
Daddy is not gonna be there.
We have to separate you for a little while.
Mum says you've been writing a story at school.
Who is Hollowface?
Susanna, it might be easier for Mia if you left us alone for a minute.
Mia, is there something you want to tell us?
Did your father tell you the story?
You know Hollowface isn't real?
Okay, Mrs Farrow...
If he comes near the house again,
Mrs Farrow, please let us know immediately.
Yes, I will.
We can get a court order.
No, no, no.
It won't be necessary, seriously.
Okay.
So, this is the room.
It's a nice room, Mia.
Do you mind if we talk outside?
Mia, I'm gonna be back in a minute, yeah?
Mia.
What if we go for a nice yummy meal tonight?
Yeah? Like a Chinese restaurant?
What do you think?
Good idea?
Let's go.
Luisa, can I speak with you when you have a minute?
He says he wants to talk to you.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Don't worry it must just be a nightmare.
I'm sure he'll calm down.
Mommy!
One, two, three, four, five.
There you'll stay forever.
Hollowface woke up because someone called his name.
After many, many years, he was free.
John?
He's back.
Who is back?
You know who.
I don't know what you're talking about, son.
Yes, you do.
No.
It can't be.
You said I made him up.
That I was dreaming.
You lied to me.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
He's hurting Mia.
I was only trying to protect you.
From what?
Son...
Forgive me.
Tell me.
I'm sorry, I had to lie to you.
He came to take you that night.
It wasn't a nightmare.
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Three, four, five...
Come on. Baby!
It's me!
John, she can't breathe!
What's happening?
The shot's not working.
Call an ambulance!
It's me. I'm here.
Can you hear me?
I know he's here and I know you're afraid, but that's all over now, because I know who he is and I know why he came back.
Come on, keep talking, keep talking, keep talking.
Hollowface woke up because someone called his name.
After many, many years, he was free.
He wasn't young or old, ugly or handsome.
He had no shape, he didn't even have a face.
They had locked him away in a dark, tiny hole where the sun never shone.
He remembered a boy with a face that looks like him.
Hollowface had to find the boy.
He had to find his face.
When he finally found where the boy was hiding,
Hollowface didn't know what to do.
Seeing the mother kiss the boy made him feel envious.
He wanted to be like the boy.
He wanted to be loved.
So he devised a plan.
First, he'd separate the boy from his mother.
Then he'd bring him to his lair.
And he would rip off his face and wear it himself.
Hollowface moved closer
and closer, and closer.
You don't know the rest of the story, but I do.
Hollowface couldn't find the boy and that made him furious.
Where's the boy?
Leave her alone, monster!
Don't be afraid, son.
You look like me.
Mia.
Mia, you have to fight back.
You have to.
Mia.
You have to fight back.
You have to fight back, Mia.
Hollowface never stole the boy's face.
Because Hollowface didn't realise something.
The boy's mother would never let him take her son away without putting up a fight.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Help me, son!
Help me!
No.
Because parents are always willing to do anything to protect their children.
It's all right.
I'm here.
You're safe.
He's gone.
He will never come back again, I promise.
It's over.
Hollowface woke up because someone called his name.
Hollowface wasn't old or young, ugly or handsome.
He had no shape, he didn't even have a face.
He had nothing.
But now,
after many, many years,
he was free.
The New South Wales government has unveiled a radical solution to the water crisis.
It plans to tap into an abandoned reservoir under the city.
$95 million will be spent on a state-of-the-art water recycling facility in the heart of Sydney.
My name is Natasha Warner and I've worked in news and current affairs for well over 10 years.
I knew that I wanted to tell stories.
I knew I wanted to communicate to the public and, um, that looked like the perfect place for me.
The NSW Minister for Water and the Environment has been under sustained fire for 12 months now.
Sydney's water reserves are at an all-time low.
We are a progressive government and in the face of climate change we need to look at all possibilities, and recycling water is definitely the way of the future.
I first came across a story which was focusing on the government that had just announced some water recycling plans and they wanted to use abandoned underground tunnels in one of our biggest rail systems.
Thousands of people pass through here each day not realising the state government's solution to the water crisis is beneath their feet.
The plan is to build recycling infrastructure to make use of millions of litres of water trapped in disused train tunnels.
I didn't realise how vast they were.
There's virtually a whole other city underneath us.
Welfare groups say the tunnels are a refuge for Sydney's homeless.
Building underground water recycling infrastructure would leave them with nowhere to go.
The new homeless concerns are likely to cause another road block for the government's water crisis solution.
In a similar scenario in the US, hundreds of homeless were recently evicted from underground tunnels.
It caused a public relations nightmare.
You can quickly see why the government's having so much trouble evicting the homeless.
I mean, trying to navigate through this maze of dark tunnels is hard.
Trying to find people hiding in here is virtually impossible.
The Water and Environment minister says there is no evidence of anyone living in Sydney's tunnels.
He says if Labor wins the election, the water solution will proceed.
After the initial fanfare the story dried up
It was like the whole thing never happened.
That's when alarm bells went off in my head. Things just don't disappear.
Whenever something's not spoken about, I've got to ask why.
It's my job as a journalist.
Cheers, John. Happy birthday.
My birthday
What's your birthday message?
What do you have to say?
Uh, John
Actually, I can tell you a story about John.
You guys may not know this one, it was way back in 1991.
My name's Steve Miller,
I'm a TV cameraman.
I've been working in news and current affairs since the mid-'80s.
Me and Pete had just started, and they sent us to the first Gulf War.
So we had to phone home to the office, to John, who was the news director at the time, and said, "Send us more cash.
"We need to get some gas masks and chemical suits and stuff."
So they sent us, like, 10 grand.
We've got this cash in our hand, we've gone, "Fuck it, let's spend it on piss!"
And the air raid sirens, everyone else is fucking pulling on their masks, and we're just going, "Oh, fuck it."
You kind of get married to the job, so the people you work with, they end up becoming like family members.
You've met our soundo.
He's an incredibly handsome young man, but he's not very good at his job.
Come here, Tangles.
What're you talking about?
I'm talking about the time in the States we went
Two weeks you went without headphones.
Remember that?
And did anyone notice?
No-one noticed!
He's a genius.
That's how good I am.
I don't even need to hear it,
I feel it on the knobs.
When you get that gang on the road, when you get Steve and Tangles out on a shoot, they're just
They're professional, but they're also kids.
At the end of the day they like to muck around and have a bit of a laugh.
I remember Natasha, she was at another network and then a couple of years later they brought her across to us.
First impression?
Just another young person coming in getting paid too much money, hadn't really proved herself.
But, you know, she was the next big thing.
Hey, Pete! Pete!
A business meeting?
Production meeting.
Production meeting.
Talking about producing some, uh
.. sea-man.
Well, yeah...produ
How's that? You'd better turn that off soon.
Pete!
Pete!
Hey?
The one that got away!
I'm not away, I'm here.
Haven't we done that story before?
Come in here, mate.
Pete and I, we had an interesting working relationship.
He was very determined in the way he would do his job and I was very determined in the way
I would do mine.
Sometimes that would work well together, and sometimes it would sort of cause a bit of friction.
Whenever her name came up, the subject was changed pretty quickly.
When you think back on it now, you sort of go,
"Oh, yeah, there was something going on there."
I came across a YouTube video which showed some youths defacing and vandalising areas around the tunnels.
Sef? Did you do this?
You are fucking kidding me!
Fucking teach them a lesson, then, eh?
I fucking will.
This is what I think of your shit, MK.
Within that clip itself there was something unknown.
Quite clearly, though, there was something there in the tunnel.
Fuck was that?
Shh... Shh
What was that?
Shut up.
Fuck, what the fuck was that?
They're still here.
Oi!
Give me the torch...
Sef, come on, let's get out of here.
Just fucking give me the torch, you bitch!
No, don't! Come on!
It's cool, it's fucking cool. Oi!
Think you can tag on my fuckin' work, do ya?
Fuck, Sef, come on.
We've gotta fucking
Fuck.
Sef!
Sef?
Sef? What the hell, Sef? Come on!
Hold on. Sef, ANSWER ME!
Sef!
Fuck this. I'm out of here.
Dez, hold on. Don't go anywhere. Wait.
J, come on!
Dez, stop!
Dez, don't rack off!
What the fuck are you doing? Help!
Sef? Sef, answer me, please!
Once I saw that clip, I thought,
"This is a story I can go to John with."
You know,
"Finally it's got some strength."
Since when does a decent journalist use YouTube as research?
It was a good clip, but at the time
I thought, "She's crazy."
When I pitched the story to John, he put Pete on this.
What that meant was
Pete had an upcoming job and story in China which he was very, very passionate about.
And I had to give him the news that he was taken off the story.
I first heard about the tunnels being a potential story for us just as we were prepping up actually to go to China, with Pete.
Hey, mate, there's a focus chart there somewhere.
Can you just hold it up for us?
Yeah, yeah. No worries.
Beauty.
He'd been working on this thing for a long time and he was pretty pumped to get over there and get stuck into it.
I think he had some pretty good leads, which could have blown his career wide open... it was great.
How's it look, mate?
Mate, it looks pretty good.
It ought to, the amount the repairs cost.
Thanks, Tangles. Nice one.
No more throwing cameras around stairwells.
Yeah, I told you guys it's not my fault, alright?
Hey, um, you happy to go handheld?
The lighter we go, the quicker we move.
Absolutely, mate.
We 're going to China after all.
More room for cheap DVDs, pirated software
You're all class, mate.
It was purely John's decision to put Pete on this story.
Well, I was a little uncomfortable with having Pete there to start with.
Like I said before, we weren't exactly always gelling.
I was really nervous about talking to Pete.
I didn't wanna tell him.
It's not that exciting, when you're building your hopes up for this great big story and then you sort of get given a shit sandwich.
I thought at that point
I was doing the right thing.
I thought that Pete having to postpone what he had planned was worth it in the end for the story.
He did say he went in to see John.
I don't know what happened in that room, and the contents of that conversation but, yeah, he had spoken to John about it, and I think it was from that point on it was clear he wasn't going to China and Nat had won the day.
Why did John go the other way?
C'mon. We all know why John was favouring Nat.
Eh?
Once Peter was on the story we started attending the daily pressers to try and find out what happened to the water recycling plans.
Pete was pissed off, but, you know, Pete's a pro.
Took him a day or two, then he came round just like the guy he is.
He started to do his own searching around
He had contacts in the council who he spoke to.
And some rumours started to surface that not only were there homeless living in the tunnels, but there were homeless that were going missing.
You know, at that point we slowly started to think there may be something in this.
So we just started by chasing the then water minister.
The main thing that was apparent
That he was staying quiet on the topic.
He wouldn't talk to us... no-one would talk to us.
At that point, we were just getting stonewalled.
If it was true that homeless were going missing, this was a big story.
And it was a really important one.
Where is he?
Through here.
Minister!
Minister, have you seen the report about the homeless people in the tunnels?
Nothing to say at the moment.
Have you scrapped your plans because people are going missing in the tunnels?
No comment. No comment.
Minister, should people be worried?
Is there a threat in the underground tunnels?
Well?
Alright... that was alright.
You reckon?
I knew we wouldn't get anything.
I think that definitely on quite a large scale there was a lot of people in the government that knew what was going on.
They knew what was going on down there.
You know, with everything that's happened subsequently, they were hiding stuff.
I started getting in contact with a few of the shelters around the city, and eventually I came across one particular homeless man who I had believed had been living in the tunnels.
So this was...
I mean, this was fantastic.
We had, finally, someone to speak to.
Right, Trevor, just one sec.
I've gotta fix your mike, if that's OK.
I'm not sure how she found Trevor, but Natasha found Trevor.
We went down to this home, and we sat him down for an interview.
Yeah, sweet.
Alright, mate. This will be fun.
You'll be on telly.
Alright, guys, I'm sweet.
Trevor, if you don't feel comfortable with anything you let me know at any time.
And, um, when I'm asking you the questions, if you're not quite sure of an answer, that's OK
We can fix it up later, so don't worry about that.
Good.
Yeah? Thank you.
Well, the interview with Trevor was a tricky one but something that I am, I guess, always quite accustomed to dealing with.
Trevor, I understand you've been living it rough
Call me Trev.
Trev? OK.
Trev, I understand you've been living it rough for quite some time now.
What circumstances took you to living in the tunnels?
Uh... Well, it kept me and my mates warm in the winter. Yeah.
It all started out great, chatting away to him.
He started to tell me a little bit about, you know, his circumstances, what led him to live in the tunnels.
He started to really paint a picture of what it was like there.
And amongst your friends,
Alfie and Johnny and Harry and some of the others, do they still live down there... now?
No.
Trev?
Hmm.
Are you OK? You comfortable?
Hmm. Yeah.
At that point in the interview,
I asked Trevor what he perhaps had been through in the tunnels.
I asked Trevor what he had seen.
Clearly something had happened to him.
Trevor, did you know someone who went missing?
Trevor, did anything happen to you down there?
Trevor
.. are you alright?
NO!
Shit.
Did you get that before?
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Oh, my God
Crazy.
I know.
After Trevor's interview, it was clear we were onto something.
All the pieces of the puzzle were symptoms of something deeper,
I just didn't know what.
I needed more.
We needed to get down there.
Your call may be recorded for training purposes.
Please advise your operator if you do not wish your call to be recorded.
Hello, this is Pam.
Oh, hi, Pam, it's Natasha Warner here.
How are you?
I'm well, Nat, and you?
Yeah, good, good, thanks.
Look, I'm just wondering if you can help me out.
I'm working on a story and I need to get into the tunnels under the CBD.
Who do I need to talk to to make that happen?
Right. What's the story?
Oh, look, I just need half an hour.
Um...just hang on a sec
Nat, sorry... I can't help you this time.
What?
Apparently no-one's getting in there, and I don't think you'll be getting any special treatment.
C'mon, Pam, it's me.
Exactly. And people got burnt last time. I can't do it.
I really need this.
Look, Pam, can you help me out?
I'm sorry, Nat.'Bye.
Look, I just need half
I guess it's easier to look at it now and say that I was perhaps under a lot of pressure to get this story.
At the time I just...
I felt I was doing my job.
I was so focused on just doing my job.
There was a lot of rumours kicking around she was in big trouble, and she kind of really needed to lift her game otherwise she was gone.
Well, I think that I'd put a lot of work into my career and I think it was all basically hanging on this one...one story.
You know, I didn't really have a choice.
Hey, Tangles, how's your head, mate?
Pete, I'm like a fucking shark.
As long as I keep moving, I'll be OK.
Here we go... this is what you looked like after Steve pulled you out of the loo last night.
Oh, Steve, new toy.
Mate, waterproof, baby! A TG!
All the gear, yeah.
Good at spending the network's money.
It's not just water-resistant, it's fully waterproof?
Yeah, waterproof, mate.
Yeah, can you roll up for me?
I'll, uh, give it a bit of sound. There it is.
Sure, mate.
Sweet.
Rolling.
Uh, great.
Pete, I'll just get you to say some shit.
Hang on...
One, two.
Here, mate, just say some shit to that.
"Some shit to that."
Um, yes, very excited to be going down the smelly sewers
Hello. How'd you go?
Haven't got all the permits sorted but, um, John's got us covered, OK?
When Natasha said that John was covering us and we didn't have permits
That's kind of a pretty loose arrangement, you know, you just sort of sit there and go, "Oh, well, we must be fine."
You sure?
Yeah.
When?
We're on for tonight.
Tonight? OK. So we are up?
Yeah, mate.
Yep, tonight. You good?
Yeah, sweet. Yeah, I'm good, man.
Alright.
The sooner we go, the better, hey?
Yep.
As a crew, it's... it's our job to film it and get coverage.
It's really not our job to question it.
Hey, Pete, just hang back. I'm just gonna get a shot of Nat walking in.
Yeah? OK.
Excuse me, guys?
Guys... Hold up, restricted area.
Oh, sorry, mate.
Maybe no-one told you.
We're just gonna be filming for about half an hour. We'll be out of your hair.
Just grabbing a few shots...
I'll need to see a permit.
Permit?
Yeah, uh
You got a permit?
I've got a driver's license.
Pete... how much have you got in your wallet?
You're kidding me, aren't you?
We're not third world here, it's not gonna work.
Guys? Everyone, time to leave, please.
Told you.
Fucking hell.
Let's go, come on.
I was that far into it
I couldn't go back at that point.
We decided to find another way in, with or without official...assistance.
We found some access round the other side.
Yeah, it looked like a maintenance access.
You sure John's got this sorted?
Grow some balls, Pete.
I, at that point, was starting to feel as though there was something not quite right.
Um, so I thought, to cover myself and to cover Tangles, and really to cover all of us,
I'd just film pretty much everything that was happening there.
You know, I thought we had to have some sort of way of protecting ourselves, should something go wrong.
You know, if we got busted and fined or whatever, arrested, um, you know, I had some evidence it wasn't me trying to push us down there, and it wasn't Tangles, but it was Natasha.
Here... take this.
Here we go.
OK, let's go.
You right? You want me to...
Take this.
Yep.
OK, make it quick.
We just were kind of covering our tracks as we went down
You know, we didn't want to get discovered.
Looking back on that
.. that was probably a mistake.
We OK?
Hey?
Are we OK to be down here?
That's what she said.
She said John's got us covered.
When we start filming a story
When we actually start
"OK, let's get it, let's roll"
Pete and Natasha, they look after the editorial content, and, you know, it's kind of my job to take over there and look after the pictures.
OK, turn around and come back.
I'll just get you walking past this grill.
You guys just hang back there for a second.
Tangles and I would go off and we'd just start getting stuck into it, filming like we always would.
You know, don't really need direction, we'd just get into it.
Once we got in sort of a little bit further, there were whole sections of tunnels that were absolutely, absolutely pitch black.
It is completely black down there.
You know, you could go in there, turn the light off, spin around and you wouldn't know where you were.
'Cause there's junctions, tunnels going off everywhere.
So I kind of thought
The first time I turned off the light and stood there, I thought we're gonna have to keep the light on and stay across where we are
'cause otherwise it's going to be pretty easy to get lost down there.
Hey, Tangles?
Yeah?
Just come here, mate.
There's something wrong with my light. Can you check it out?
What do you mean?
Is it the connection?
Yeah, can you look in real close?
Is there something stuck on it?
Ah, shit!
How did I not see that coming?
Thanks for that, Steve.
My eyes are stuffed.
Great.
Let's go.
Pete had sourced a map of the tunnels, but the further we got in, the more we realised it wasn't exactly accurate.
There were whole sections of tunnels that weren't even on the map.
Just give us some light here, Steve.
OK. So that's the entrance, that's where we came down before
That's that way. That's not here...
I don't know why that is.
OK, through here.
Yep. That must be the way.
Once we got through and past the maintenance areas and we got into a little bit more of the guts of the tunnels, my impressions were that...that it was amazing.
It was vast, this place was huge.
That's awesome.
Shit, the sound's great.
Pete? Can I have 10 minutes to grab some overlay here?
I'll give you five.
Five?
Yep.
We were very close to the station there, so, um, you know, Pete was trying to make us pretty low-key.
I was blown away by the size of it... it was massive, and just eerie.
You know, I think we were all in awe of it.
It wasn't really difficult to get great-looking shots down there, you know, 'cause you're really just painting stuff with your light and whatever you saw there just was... it looked really cool.
This is looking really good.
Hey, guys, just hush for a sec.
Alright, looks good. Yeah, sweet.
The history to these tunnels, the ones in particular that we were looking at, was just incredible.
I mean, it dates back pre-World War II.
They were to be used as an underground rail system.
Then in World War II they were used as air raid shelters.
Come have a look at this.
The current NSW government is not the first to use these tunnels for another purpose.
I'm standing in a section of tunnel that was converted into an air raid shelter during World War ll.
It's complete with all the amenities that enabled soldiers to stay for extended periods.
Various rooms were then, um, reused and fashioned for training for the SAS.
So time and time again they've,
I guess, been reinvented for their use, and even to this day with the water recycling plans that were announced.
I was fortunate enough to come across an area where it was evident that there was definitely, you know, homeless or, you know, people living down there.
That's good...good just here.
I'm right to go?
Hang on a sec.
Go when you're ready.
We've been walking in the tunnel for less than an hour, and already we've come across somebody's home.
Here you can see their makeshift bed, blanket and empty tins of food.
Coming across the belongings was very important
It was vital to the story.
It was absolute proof that there was life down here.
While there is no sign of an occupant at the moment, it is clear the minister's assertions of abandoned tunnels are incorrect.
This was something that the government were denying.
This is something that we could now prove.
Hey, Nat, I'll get a shot of you going down there, actually.
Yeah, cool.
Oh, hey. Light.
Cheers.
Mate, what's up?
What? Nothing.
It's a bit tight down there, tubby.
You reckon you're gonna make it?
He mustn't like working on the show.
Nat! You alright?
Nat, you alright?
Yeah, I'm right.
Do you need a hand?
No, I'm fine.
Nat? Look, we've already got the sleeping bags and stuff, we don't really need to get the lake.
We could probably do the rest up here.
Pete... Pete, I'm alright.
I just think it's a little...
I'm fine!
Just let's keep going.
Alright, you take that.
Yeah.
What's eating her?
Oh, she just really needs the story.
After what happened last time, she's treading on thin ice.
Yeah, I reckon.
That's why John put me onto this... make sure she doesn't fuck up again.
If she's not up to it, why doesn't he give her the arse?
Mate, I think John'd wanna give her a little more than just that.
Well, he'd have to get in line behind you, wouldn't he?
Hey, guys, you might wanna know for future reference that these tunnels carry sound pretty well.
And as far as I can hear, you're all arseholes.
Fuck off!
Yeah, give me the torch.
Right, yeah, hang on.
There you go, mate.
Get down there, you arsehole.
Pete, can you just lift that handle up for me? Get a bit of sound.
Where to? Just
Yeah, nice.
Give it a kick.
Yeah, give it a kick.
Send it on its way.
What are we doing?
Just...just give it a kick.
You call it.
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.
Thanks, guys.
The lake was just...so...vast.
I mean, this thing runs a kilometre long.
It's bigger than I thought.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Me and Tangles were mucking around a bit
We like to play jokes on each other.
You know, if I didn't do it, he would've done it.
So I just grabbed him and sort of went
.. you know, at the edge of the lake, went to push him in.
You know how you go up, hold onto their shoulders and pull them back again?
Which I did, and then I let go of him, and went to walk back to the camera
In he went.
Shit.
Tangles, are you right?
Yeah, slipped.
There's your dip, mate.
Steve, you...prick.
Oi, this is not funny. It's fucking cold.
Are you gonna give him a hand?
No, fuck him!
This is not... Stop laughing, OK?
How long are we gonna be down here, alright?
Tangles, as much as we used to joke around and muck around together, when it came time to work, you know, he was very serious, and it wasn't time for joking.
Creative department's ready.
Just letting you know.
OK.
Nat, just come forward a fraction.
So, you know, when he's sort of giving me the impression that there were problems,
I was believing him.
I'm standing directly below one of Sydney's busiest train stations.
Behind me is the forgotten water resource that's causing all the controversy.
Earlier this year the government
Nat, sorry. Pete, are you making noise?
No.
You weren't whispering?
No.
Alright. Sorry, Nat.
Can we go from the top?
Everyone, just keep it quiet. Thank you.
OK, let's go from the top again.
Let's move.
When you're ready, Nat.
I'm standing directly below one of
Sydney's busiest train stations.
Behind me is the forgotten water resource
Nat, sorry. Are you guys fucking with me? What's the noise?
What are you hearing, mate?
It's... Hang on, I'll just check the battery.
Sweet, um, I don't know.
Maybe it's your cables.
Yeah, cables don't fucking talk, Steve.
Uh, alright. Sorry, Nat.
Go for it again, I'll see what I can do.
Just go straight through.
If Tangles says he heard something,
I do believe he felt he heard something.
I can't describe how silent the place was, so at the time I didn't feel that... he could have been hearing anything.
It...it was strange.
I was just thinking, you know, it could have been a technical problem, could have been anything... some
RF interference, anything like that.
But, you know, Tangles was adamant there was something going on, and, uh, when he's serious about something, you know, you believe him.
Earlier this year, the government announced, then quietly abandoned, plans to recycle water from this lake.
The Minister for Water has yet to give a reason why.
Beautiful. Pete, happy?
I'm happy. How are you, Tangles?
Oh...yeah. Yeah, sweet, yeah.
Alright, let's go.
Let's move, grab the sticks.
Alright, let's go.
After we'd finished our piece at the lake, um, we decided to head for the bell room.
Righto, Nat.
Basically the bell room was built as like a air raid sort of alert back in the war.
They would use it to warn people of danger.
When we rang the bell, it...it was deafening.
It rattled your ribs.
This bell is a relic of World War ll.
It remains here in the confines of an air raid shelter, as a reminder of what imminent danger sounds like.
Shit, that blew my levels right off the meter, sorry. Um
Hang on. Nat, can you just hit the bell once more?
Yep. Ready to go?
Yep.
How's that?
Nah, look, if you want me to get that, it's probably best I boom it from down the hall.
Yeah, OK. Well, if we need it.
OK, cool, two seconds.
Tangles decided to, um, go into the adjoining room off the bell room and boom it from there just to basically kill the sound of the level of the bell, which was just making his levels peak out.
I don't really know much about recording sound, but I did at the time remember thinking, "That's a bit weird."
You know, why would you do that?
Just turn it down a little bit.
Surely it's that simple?
Uh, Steve, can you do me a favour?
Can you just listen on the cans, watch the levels for me?
Why don't you get Pete to do it? He can do camera, he must be able to do sound.
Nah, mate, I've done enough hard work today.
That's good, Nat, yeah.
I'll do it for ya, mate.
Sorry, guys, it's just way too echoey in here.
He asked me to listen to the audio for him, which was fine.
It's just put on the headphones and listen to it as it's being recorded.
Here, Tangles. Take that.
Thanks very much.
And then so Nat just went ahead and did it again, and, uh...that's
That's when, uh
.. that's when I heard it.
Yeah, ready to go.
Bell atmos.
Whenever you're ready, Nat.
What the fuck?
Did you... did you hear that?
Yeah.
Yo, Tangles!
Tangles!
Shit.
Tangles!
Pete, we need some light down here, mate. Tangles!
Quick, light.
Shit. Steve, where are you?
Down here. Straight, straight, straight.
Just give us the camera, mate.
He's... he's gone.
Where'd he go?
Tangles!
What did you hear in the headphones?
Tangles!
What did you hear in your headphones?
Tangles!
Would he be dickin' us round?
Tangles!
Tangles, come on, mate!
Steve, through here.
Tangles!
Tangles!
Yo, Tangles!
Here, I'll go down here.
Yeah.
You know, I knew there was something wrong.
I knew he wasn't mucking around.
My initial thought was just to get to him.
It wasn't unlike them, so I guess my first instinct was that they were having a joke.
What, Nat thought we were playing a prank, did she?
You've spoken to her?
She thought we were fucking around?
Tangles, you good?
Yep. Ready to go.
Bell atmos.
Tangles!
Maybe through here...
No, that's a dead end.
Tangles!
Watch your step.
Tangles!
Ah, great.
What's up?
Battery.
You alright?
Yeah, fuck. It's alright.
Need the light? You got a spare?
Yeah, it's in here, hang on.
OK.
It became pretty evident, quite quickly, that we weren't gonna be able to find anyone or anything without light.
Got it.
We'll get him, mate. We'll find him.
We'll find him, alright?
Tangles!
Now, I had my camera light and I knew I had about two, maybe three hours tops worth of light.
Steve, where's your kit?
Tangles!
Steve, where's your kit?
What?
Where's your kit?
It's back in the bell room.
OK. well... all the torches are back there, aren't they?
This is the only light you've got and it's fucking around.
We need the torches, mate.
We've gotta go back to the bell room.
But Tangles
It's alright. We'll get him.
We'll find him. C'mon.
Fuck.
C'mon.
Walked back into the bell room and there was nothing.
There was nothing there.
All the stuff had disappeared.
Now, that was only in a matter of
I don't know, couldn't have been too long.
Shit, everything's gone.
What?
What the hell's going on?
It certainly raised some concern because I didn't feel it was something that
Tangles could do by himself.
Fuck!
Hey, we're wasting time, guys. Let's go!
Wait.
C'mon!
Here, take this.
Pete!
Just give me some light, Steve.
OK.
OK, Tangles went through here.
If we follow that all the way round, it brings us back to this room, we can scan the whole area.
OK. So we split up and meet back here, yeah?
No, we stick together.
That's the only light we've got.
How many batteries have you got left?
I've got two in my pouch, mate.
Let's go.
Steve... STEVE!
Oh, fuck!
It won't do Tangles any good if we run round like headless cheeks.
We stick together, alright?
You'd better keep up, then.
Tangles!
Steve, wait!
C'mon, Nat.
Tangles!
Yeah, I panicked.
You know, it wasn't like
I'm trying to be a hero or anything.
You know, the smarter thing might have been to do something else but it was just instinct just kicking in.
Tangles!
So, what do you think?
Think of what?
You know, Tangles, is he dicking around?
No, he wouldn't dick around for this long.
Who took our stuff, then?
Who took it? I don't know.
Could have been the homeless, junkies
I heard it, Pete.
You heard what?
Whatever it was, mate.
Well, what was it, mate?
Steve?
Look, let's just get going, OK?
Steve? Steve? What was it?
Shit.
Watch your step.
What's in here?
Oh, fuck.
You right?
Yeah.
Nope, nothing.
Pete, we've been here twice before, mate.
The only other place has got to be the lake.
Maybe he went back from where we came.
Maybe he's waiting for us.
Oh, sure, mate. He's fucking walked out in the pitch-black.
He's at fucking Harry's, scoffing a pie.
I don't mean that.
I mean he can't contact us.
Maybe he's waiting for us.
No, Steve's right, OK?
Tangles is down here.
He's got to be at the lake, mate.
Well, how much light have you got?
I've got enough.
Alright, then.
Shh! Do you hear that?
Shh.
Shh!
Let's go!
Go.
Tangles!
Tangles!
This way! Tangles!
I heard him through here. Tangles!
Tangles! I'm coming, mate!
Oh, fuck it!
In here!
Give us a hand. Quick.
Get down and grab it at the bottom.
Fuck it! Get it off! Get it open!
Grab that back. Grab that.
Oh, shit. Steve, help.
Jesus.
Steve, light. Light.
Jesus Christ.
Steve...
Yeah?
His torch.
It's his torch, but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.
I can't really describe it, it was just
There was blood and
.. over in the corner was...Tangles's torch.
I... I sort of thought of myself as his older brother.
You know, that was the kind of relationship we had.
And, uh, he was sort of entrusted to me.
That's the way I felt about it.
Let's go.
Could be anyone.
C'mon. We've got to move.
She's right. He could be close, mate.
What about Tangles?
Whatever that fucking thing is, it could be nearby.
Come on.
It's Tangles.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait.
What?
Wait, where's my camera?
Just over there.
It's not where I left it.
What?
It's not where I left it.
Before we entered the room Nat put the camera, the night vision camera, on the ground just outside the door.
Um...and then we went in the room.
We wouldn't have been in there for more than two or three minutes, and then she came out, we all came out together, and she noticed the camera had been moved.
My instinct was to check it and see if it had recorded something.
Play it back.
Tangles!
Tangles!
Get down and grab it at the bottom.
Fuck it. Get it off! Get it open!
Grab that back. Grab that.
We played back the footage and, uh, someone had picked up the camera, it had come off the ground, and there were shots of us in the room.
It's his torch, but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.
Let's go.
C'mon. We've got to move.
She's right. He could be close, mate.
Whatever that fucking this is, it could be nearby.
It's Tangles.
Come on.
Let's go.
And then we turn to come out and...the camera goes down and we just catch a glimpse... it was just like one frame.
It happened in a split second.
I didn't know what it was, mate, but it was quick and it was fucking frightening.
Fuck.
Oi!
This isn't good.
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out of here.
Mate, I am not fucking leaving him down here with whatever the fuck that was.
Steve, listen, listen to me.
I'm not fucking leaving him.
Look, right now my priority is with you and Nat.
I'm not going to let what happened to
Tangles happen to both of you, alright?
We have to get out to the top.
You go on your own. Leave me here.
Steve, we need your light. Come on.
You've got your own fucking light.
Listen, Steve, listen to me.
Listen to me!
Fuck off!
Listen to me!
I'm not done!
Don't fucking touch me, man!
Listen, listen!
Listen, listen, listen to me.
Whatever that fucking thing is it's going to have a harder time taking us out if we stick together.
That's bullshit.
Listen. We need to get to the top.
We need to get help.
If we get more help down here, the better chance we 're going to find Tangles.
Fucking Tangles, man.
I know, mate.
Hey, mate, I'm with you.
I'm with you.
Come on.
Come on.
Pete made sense, but I couldn't help but feel like
I was leaving Tangles behind.
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
Is he OK?
Just give him a few minutes.
So, what's the plan?
We get the fuck out of here is the plan. Get back to the top.
What?
I think we should stay and look for Tangles.
You're not here for Tangles.
You're not here for Tangles.
Fuck!
Just through here.
Fuck!
Back it up, back it up!
Hit the light. Kill the light.
Fuck!
Shh!
What is it, mate?
Shh, shh!
Anyone down there?
It's the guard.
Shit, it's the guard.
Who's there?
Hey, mate, it's us. It's the film crew.
I told you guys not to come down here.
Yeah, look, I know, we're sorry.
It's just our friend, he's gone missing.
Someone... something's taken him.
Right, I want all of you to come with me now.
Hey, come on!
Mate, what's happening in here?
Mate, tell us what's happening in here!
Nat, give it a break, Nat.
We're leaving. LET'S GO!
Is he going to help us?
Go! Go! Run!
Keep moving!
Keep going.
Keep going, Nat.
Fuck!
Not that way.
Here. Through here.
Kill the light.
Hey?
Steve, kill the light!
Shh!
Where are we?
Shh!
What was that?
I don't know.
Just keep it down, it could be close.
Did you see it?
No.
But whatever it was, it was fucking huge.
Nat... turn it off.
Everybody alright?
Mate, mate, I'm alright.
How about your arm?
Give me the camera.
Let me see.
I hit something when we were running. It's fine.
Shit, Steve. It looks bad.
Nah.
Here, Pete, I need to see.
Here, show me.
Fuck. Doesn't look good, mate.
I can't see.
There it is. You got it.
Just there, yeah.
Sorry, you right?
I'll be fine, yeah.
Right, buddy?
Thanks, though. Thanks.
You guys ready to move soon?
We can't stay.
I just need a minute. Hang on.
What if that thing comes back?
I don't know.
Could we take it?
I doubt it.
Only thing we've got to worry about now is getting out of here.
Hey, guys, I think it's gone.
Right, let's get moving.
Steve?
Yeah?
You right, mate?
Yeah, mate. Yeah, I'm good.
Let's go.
Just keep it quiet.
Give me the camera.
Just keep it quiet, OK?
OK, let's go.
Stay close.
Through here.
OK.
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.
OK.
Oh, fuck.
Pete...
Shit!
This wasn't here before.
Pete.
What are you doing?
It's not on the map.
What do you mean it's not on the map?
It's only got one way.
This has got two.
Pete, you've got to figure it out, OK?
Just chill the fuck out.
It's not easy, alright?
You've got to fix this.
Just shut the fuck up and let me get through it.
Nat, calm down, Nat.
It's through here. We came back through there. It's through here.
OK, what if it's not the right way, mate?
Well, then... we find the safest room and we wait it out.
Oh, yeah, that's a good plan.
John will figure out that we haven't called and he'll send someone down to find us.
John knows we're here, right?
Nat
Fucking tell me John knows we're here.
Oh, you're fucking kidding me.
I can't...
Are you fucking serious?
I... I needed you guys, OK?
I knew it!
I needed you guys in this.
You need us?
Yeah.
We just lost a friend.
You still need your fucking story?
No.
Huh?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Keep you voice down.
You think you're a fucking journalist.
Shh!
We came down here to get a story, didn't we?
And now we've got an important one, and you're fucking running scared!
Shhh!
Here's your fucking story.
Here, you want your piece to camera?
Come on. Let's go.
What's your piece to camera for this one, huh?
Do you want to tell us how... how you lost your friend because of your fucking stupidity?
Come on.
Waiting.
Fuck you.
Come on, Nat.
Come on.
The best journalists can work under any pressure, any sort of circumstance, come on.
See, you can't say shit, can you?
You know why?
Because you're not there, Nat.
You're just not there.
You're fucking pathetic.
Here. Through here.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
Listen.
Shh!
What the fuck...?
What?
Shh.
What is it?
Hear that?
Through here.
Kill the light.
Shh!
Open the door, Nat.
Open it up. Open it up.
Guys, the lake's just here.
Fuck!
Shh!
Let me see, let me see.
Is it Tangles, mate?
Shh, shh.
What is it?
It's not Tangles.
What's happened to his face?
Oh, Jesus.
It's his eyes. Oh, Jesus.
What's happening?
We've got to help him.
Let me see.
Shh.
Shh!
Oh, fuck. It's seen us.
We got to go, come on, come on!
Come on, let's go!
Steve!
Fuck! Let's go. Ah!
Go, go, GO!
Just move it!
Jesus. Which way? Which way?
This way?
Go! Go now!
Where? Where?
Here, here, here. Through here!
Steve!
Go!
Come on! Keep moving!
Steve! Is he still behind us?
I think we lost him!
You sure?
I think so!
Shit.
I think we lost it!
I don't... I don't think it followed us.
In here. There's a light in here.
Here, here.
There.
What's that?
I think it's the Cross City Tunnel.
Hello?
This is a bad place to stop.
No, it's fucking pointless.
Hello?!
Shit, Pete.
Shh!
Hello! Hello!
Shh! Shh!
You've got to keep it down.
There's no-one there, there's no-one there.
Please, someone... help. Hello!
Shh, shh.
Hello! Help!
Help!
Shh! Nat, please. Let go. Please.
You have to be quiet!
Help!
Shh!
Shh! Nat, Nat, Nat.
Hey, you guys.
Help!
You've gotta keep your voice down.
Shhh!
Shut her up.
Shh. Shh.
You get anything?
Can you see anything?
Chuck the light.
Chuck the light over there.
Nuh.
It's alright.
I'm sorry.
Hey?
I'm sorry.
It's alright, don't be sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Shh.
It's OK, shh. Shh.
Everything was unravelling.
It... it was because of me.
I never meant for things to get so out of hand.
Well, I didn't mean to let Pete down. I mean, I
I had thought I'd made the right choice at the time and I didn't mean to let him down.
Steve, through here.
Quick, quick. Come on, move it, mate.
Up here.
Nat. Up.
Come on. Shh!
Here, Nat, take this.
Ohhh!
Mate, get up! Come on!
Ugh!
You know, my natural instinct was to turn around with the light, see what was going on.
We'd just heard this sound,
Pete yelling out, and, uh, as soon as they sort of fell into the pool of light the thing just...disappeared... upped and left
And that sort of dawned on me then that the light was our way of keeping it away from us.
Shit. Are you OK? You OK?
Come on!
Fuck! Did you see that?
It took off.
Let's get out of here. Let's go.
It didn't like the light.
Well, keep it on, then.
Hold on. Nat.
Nat!
Ah!
No!
Come on, come on!
Come on, you fucker!
Pete! Pete, don't.
Come on! Come on!
Go! Come on!
It was almost like it was trying to get us in a position where it could get to us as well.
It reminded me of a lion trying to cut one animal out of a pack, a herd.
You know, get the weak one out, easy to attack.
Ah! Oh, fuck! Fuck.
We're losing the light!
Oh, fuck!
- Steve!
Oh, shit!
Back, back, back!
BACK! Fuck!
Go through.
What's the matter?
No, it's a dead end. It's a dead end.
Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
I thought that was it... it was over.
There was nowhere left to run.
Then I saw this tiny bit of wall that looked like it had broken away.
Pete, take this, take this.
Take it!
Oh, shit!
Give her a hand, Pete. Get in there.
Hold the light still.
Easy, Nat.
Shh, keep it down. Keep it down.
Keep it down.
Here, come through, Steve.
Huh?
Come through.
Go, go, go.
Go on, you go first.
Come on, Nat.
Good girl.
Here, take this... quick.
Here, Nat.
OK.
Shh, shh, keep it down. Shh!
This isn't good.
Steve.
Steve, is that...? God.
This isn't good.
Steve.
Yeah?
We've got to go.
Fuck!
Light, mate, light.
Sorry.
It's gone.
Batteries.
Steve
Fuck, I need some light over here.
Quick, Nat, light.
Nat, the fucking light, Nat. Fuck!
Give me the torch.
Oh, shit! That one's dead.
Oh, Jesus.
There's only one left.
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
Steve, we need that light.
We need the fucking light.
Steve, I need the fucking light!
Come on!
OK.
Oh, Jesus.
OK, now
RUN!
Steve.
Steve. OK, OK.
Steve.
Come on. It's going for her.
It's going for her.
We've got to go.
Come on. Come on.
Nat!
Nat!
Let her go!
Let her go, you fucker!
Nat!
Take her. Take her!
OK.
Go. Just go!
Come on, Nat. Alright, let's go.
Oh, shit. Come on.
- Come on!
Come on, you fucker!
Come on, Nat.
Come on, let's move!
No...
Move!
No.
Come on.
Come on.
Wait!
Come on.
But Pete...
Come on!
No. Steve, we can't leave.
Come on!
We got
Nat, keep moving.
Keep moving!
No.
We've got to keep moving!
You can't leave Pete.
We can't! We've got to go!
Come on, Nat.
We've got to keep moving.
I think that Pete was looking out for us and I didn't want to leave him there.
Come on! Come on.
Pete wanted us to be safe...
I understand that.
But I didn't...
I didn't want to leave Pete behind.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
- Guys!
Guys!
Shit!
Guys!
Oh, fuck. It's Pete. Fuck.
Come on, man!
When I heard Pete's voice coming down that tunnel, out of the darkness, uh
I mean, I wasn't expecting to hear his voice again.
Pete, no...
I can't
No
Let's go.
Let's go!
No, Pete...
- Nat!
Pete, are you OK? Stay with me.
Help! Get some help! Someone!
I need a phone! I need a phone!
Give me a phone! Give me a phone!
Hey.
Hello. Police, fire or ambulance?
Hello?
Yes. Hello?
Do you need police, fire or ambulance?
Hello!
Help! We need help, we need help!
OK, miss, we'll get you some help.
What's happened?
We're on platform one.
We're in the station.
Please, you gotta get someone here now.
My friend is dying. He's bleeding.
Please calm down, miss.
I need you to tell me exactly where you are and what's happening.
I don't know... we're in the station and something... something took our friend.
OK, please stay calm.
You said you're at the station?
Which station are you at?
Help me! Somebody HELP me!
What are you doing?!
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Are you there?
Hello?
Pete... Hey, Pete.
Pete
I'm sorry... Pete! PETE!
Yeah, it's kind of hard to... to talk about it now.
But I didn't know he was dying at that point.
You know, I thought we were all gonna be fine.
I mean
.. it had been so difficult to get to that point where we got there, and then, you know, I thought we were going to be OK.
There was people around us, there was light.
I...you know... I would have been doing more if I thought he was lying there dying.
I...I feel that I could have done more to help Pete.
You know, it's, um...it's easy to say that you would do things differently, you know.
It just didn't seem...very fair.
I got told by the first paramedics that, you know... they'd sort of given up working on him, they sort of...you know... took a while to get Nat away from him.
And, uh, it slowly, slowly dawned on me about that point, you know.
They sort of walked away from him.
He was just lying there, and he wasn't moving, and I was... I just thought, "Fuck."
I feel...I feel...I feel responsible.
I don't want to say that
I felt like it was my fault.
I don't know exactly how
I've changed since that night.
I can't help thinking we were so close.
Help was right there.
I go over it again and again.
Just constantly.
What would I do differently?
I was just pissed off with everyone, everything.
The government
.. the police
I mean, how much evidence do you want?
It's just sad now, thinking about it.
It's pointless.
It's just fucking sad.
You'll be spending a lot of time in here.
This is gonna be your room.
There's some kind of animal being de-liced or something.
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.
It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.
- What color is that, hon?
- Jamaica Bay Blue.
Jamaica! And there you are.
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.
And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
Sorry. I can help.
- Yeah? Come on.
- If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder. That's... You know.
All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- It's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.
- Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- Yeah?
This is so gorgeous.
I love it. I love the blue.
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.
- How are you feeling?
- All right.
You know, I think I'm okay.
- How is he?
- He's doing so good.
He's kicking and, like, swimming.
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!
- What did you say?
- It's Hunter.
- No! Tyler. It's Tyler.
- I like that.
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's...
I like... I like both.
I don't wanna choose.
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to. Come on.
In preparation for the big move,
I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?
- This is the last box.
- Really?
Probably.
Oh, God!
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
VHS? That is old school.
Do we have a VCR?
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know. You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
We're not 12.
We can get a VCR for free.
You know, I don't remember these at all.
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful. Just beautiful. And you're beautiful. I don't know how you do it.
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
Watch your hair. Good job.
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
I found some.
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
- Twenty bites and that's about all.
- Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
Hey, Julie. Go get Kristi.
Say hi, Kristi!
Hi.
Kristi's a little shy.
That's cute. They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time. You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- It's something...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
I...
- I just... I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much. Happy birthday.
- Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy. It's dead.
You're a little monster.
- All right, all right, I got my camera.
- Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
- Lower lip.
- Want some juice, babe?
- Down.
- Here.
Now...
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, orange juice.
That is... That is a good one!
- All right.
- Let's see this. Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
It's ready.
- I think it might be...
- It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
Thank you. You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
Wow. You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
He's hungry?
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- Hey. It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
My assistant Randy is currently
43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
- Come on around the front door.
- Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you? What happened?
- Sorry I'm late. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah. Here, push this up here.
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second. I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know. I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here? Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey. No. Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
No.
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him. He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- I do!
- Oh, come on.
- I have a new trick to show you.
- Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay. Yeah?
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
- It wasn't even a spider.
- That really hurt. That really hurt.
- Hi.
- Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- Sorry.
- I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
Here it goes.
All right.
Cheese.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- No, no, no. Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know. I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding...
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
Jule?
Julie?
There it goes again.
Hello?
Julie?
I like this song!
Not bad.
That's pretty good.
Teddy? Did you fall down?
What was that?
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing. I was just looking around.
What... What...
You guys just get home?
Yeah.
- It was girls' day.
- I know. How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
You just really snuck up on me there.
All right. It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me? I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
Let's get really serious. Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
That was big.
Julie, do the voice.
Dennis.
What voice?
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, there, pretty lady.
Stop. I don't know.
You sure... You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what? Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Okay, sorry.
All right.
What are you doing? What was that?
It's porno music.
Great. Classy.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Relax. Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- Relax.
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls. The girls!
Come on! Dennis!
Dennis. Oh, my God, I look so fat.
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe
'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- That's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late. I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right? Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah. I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
Check this out. Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know. Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know. I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you...
Dennis!
Sorry! Sorry.
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll... I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay. Love you, too.
How long do the tapes last?
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay. Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here. Come here. See it?
Yeah.
Pretty cool, right?
So, what are you trying to see?
Anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I... I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
It's okay.
Why?
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
Toby's your friend?
Yes. He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Secrets.
He's big?
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall? Is he fat?
He's tall. He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
- You saw her.
- That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long. They do weird things.
They... Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
What?
Okay? I'm serious.
Really?
Yes. Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man. I got two cameras, six hours each. Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah. Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes. Now, please,
I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No. You find anything?
Yes, actually. We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called
Back to the Past...
Present. Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
Back to the Present.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
- Was that... That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
It's in your closet.
Are you getting that?
Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
Holy shit!
Holy shit! That's not funny.
- Oh, my God. You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- I got you.
- You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too. Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there,
'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Oh, my God, get away!
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away. I hate you.
Wow. Look at that tent.
Gosh. I like this tent.
"...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello. Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
- Guys? I got you a little...
- Give it to me.
Hey, guys. Don't tell Mom, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
Come here.
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right. Good night, girls. I love you.
- Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.
Dennis. Dennis.
- What?
- Listen.
What?
I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them. I got it.
Girls?
Dennis.
Dennis?
Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry. It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on. Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy. Why?
- What?
Dennis, will you film me?
- Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
Very impressive. Very good.
Thank you. Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
Where's Dennis?
He's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No. That's... No.
He has his own business.
You know? It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom. I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
You always wanted a son.
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
What the...
Fuck.
This is great. Hang on.
That's great! Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
Nothing, don't worry. It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
I know. You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work. It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
Mirrors.
You could use mirrors.
- This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome. Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
Oh, man.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What... What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool. Wait, what? You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
It's cool, right?
This way I can...
Kristi, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed. It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
No.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books,
I got you the books.
It's what a library is. It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities. What is this one?
I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay. And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason. It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here. What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine. Kristi!
Kristi, come on. Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay. I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say
"Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop! Stop!
Stop, Katie.
So, now what do we do?
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- We have to be quiet.
- Guys...
- My gosh, Mom! You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. We're just playing a game.
Okay. Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah. We gotta move it before he comes home
'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- Yeah.
You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?
God damn it.
- Mom?
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay? Holy shit.
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs. Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor. Stay there.
- Are you hurt?
I have no idea, I have no idea.
Looks fine, right? It didn't even break.
That's good.
- What happened?
- It just fell. I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait. Why are you filming this?
It's just like,
I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there. That's Toby's spot.
Sorry. Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay. Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here. He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow. He was thirsty. See, I told you.
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets. Regular stuff. In her sink?
Yeah. Sorry.
That... Did you... Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
No.
Sorry, Toby. It was a mistake, right?
Yeah.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
Hey, Kristi! Kristi's such a baby! Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not! He's right in there.
In there? Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie! Don't go in there.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
Katie.
Kristi! What are you doing?
Open the door!
You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling? What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- Then who locked me in there?
Toby did.
Yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
She's gonna be here any minute.
See? There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
Okay!
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi! How are you?
Good.
- I wanna show you something upstairs.
- Hi, Lisa.
Wait, what are you showing me?
I got some new beads for my birthday.
Beads! Let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi. How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.
8:30 bedtime?
No, no, no, 10:00.
- 8:30. Nice try.
- Mommy, please.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, guys. Love you.
Look, it made a triangle.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Good night, girls!
- Good night.
- See you later.
- Bye, Julie. Bye, Dennis.
Are you tired?
- Not really.
- No?
Can you tell us a story?
Sure. What kind of story?
A ghost story.
Ghost story? With a ghost.
Okay, let's think.
I'm a ghost!
Hello, Dennis! You found the ghost.
Comin' to get you.
Got you!
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, sweetie.
Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.
- Hey!
Hi!
- How'd it go?
- Fine, it was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they were great.
The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...
No, no, no, no, it was good.
But my mom's meeting me, so if I could just...
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, give her some money.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You're sure everything was good?
Yeah, no. Thank you, guys.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Okay, bye. Thanks.
I don't know.
- That was weird.
- Yeah.
It's so high.
Promise?
Okay.
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Why are you up?
Why are you up?
Nothing.
Kristi, go to bed. It's late.
- Is that the babysitter?
- Yeah, that's Lisa.
How come I never met her?
I'll put in a good word.
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.
Am I... Am I right?
Holy...
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!
I'm not crazy, right? I'm not crazy.
That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man. What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know. I am.
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.
She got blown in the face.
Yeah, yeah.
No.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I'm going to bed.
What the...
What the fuck?
Hey, how's she feeling?
We need to go to the doctor
'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi!
Randy, thank you so much.
We're gonna be at the hospital for a little bit.
Okay.
Anything you guys want...
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Bye! Love you. Bye, Kristi!
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?
Yeah, I have it.
- Thanks a lot.
- Love you. Bye.
- I'll lock the door.
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks again.
- I'll lock it.
All right, be good, Katie. See you.
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.
So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so. I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
Sorry, Dennis. Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you. Good game.
Yep.
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Randy!
Nothing happened.
You turned the light on too soon.
Come on, Katie. This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay. Okay.
All right. You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Okay, can I turn it on now?
- Quiet.
- Sorry. Sorry.
How about now?
Wait, wait.
- What?
- Did you hear that?
What was that?
I know. I heard it, too.
Holy shit!
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?
Huh?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
I just scratched myself or something.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
It's okay. Nothing...
Close the door. It's okay. It's all right.
It's all right. It's okay.
I don't want to die! Randy, I'm scared!
Holy shit! It's okay!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy fuck!
You okay? You okay?
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
Dear God. Please, God.
Please, God, be with me.
It's okay! It's okay!
I don't want to play this.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Stay here.
I don't wanna play anymore.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
Holy fuck!
Okay.
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?
Nothing. You're fine.
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.
We're gonna get out of here.
Come on, Randy! Come on, Randy!
Stay here.
Dear Lord, be with me, please, be with me.
- Randy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
- It's okay.
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!
It's okay. Huh?
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.
I'm not gonna tell. I'm not gonna tell.
It's all right. It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.
Fuck.
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man? Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy. What... What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What... What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax. Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you,
I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done. Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but... What are you gonna do? You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous. Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- Hey.
What?
I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here. Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s. Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy. Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right? These...
These women, they were...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I... I... I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
Kristi!
You'd better run!
You sound crazy. Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would... They would...
They would take their sons.
Right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't. I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait! I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
- What the fuck? I don't...
What? What? What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
This is your fault.
Okay? This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey... I didn't...
No more cameras.
No more ghosts. This ends tomorrow.
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.
Kristi.
Wake up!
Katie, go back to sleep.
What was that?
What's happening?
Kristi!
Toby's here.
I'm scared! Mom! Mommy!
- Mommy!
- Stop screaming!
It's okay! Just ignore it!
Just ignore it!
Mom!
Kristi!
Kristi, help me!
Kristi!
Please... Please... Please help me!
Katie!
Let her go! Let her go!
Toby, stop! Stop, Toby!
I'll do it.
Just let her go!
I'm scared. I want Mommy!
...to Grandma's house.
No, we're not going to Grandma's house, okay?
Why?
We're not going to Grandma's because there's no Toby, sweetie.
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Hey. There's no ghost and that's the end of it.
I don't want to hear any more of this talk, okay?
Okay?
- What'd she say?
- She said no.
No. No. Mom, we're not coming over.
Okay? We're staying right here.
Because I need to get things back to normal.
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door, okay?
I'll call you back. Yeah, okay.
Hello?
Weird.
Dennis!
Dennis! Dennis, get the girls!
We're getting out of here!
Girls, wake up, we're here.
Wake up. We're here.
Yay, we're here.
There's Grandma.
Mommy, I'm tired.
Go park by the garage.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.
Hi, honey. Come on, go.
You go with your mom.
I've got your sister. Come on. Come on.
Mommy.
Sleepy girl is what she is.
Go on in the house. I've got apple pie and I've got... You want water, I know.
How're we doing?
Put the camera down and come and eat some pie.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
It makes me feel better to do something.
- Okay. Okay.
- Feel useful.
Are you okay?
- How's it going, kiddo?
- What is going on?
- Good.
- How you feeling?
...not talk about it right now.
We can talk about it when...
Just... Let's just drop it.
- Hey, Kristi?
- What?
Don't touch the painting, okay?
It's okay, I'm not mad.
Do you like it?
What's the matter?
Kristi! Come and get your pie!
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
You playing some dress-up?
Doesn't she make a beautiful bride?
- Very.
- Do you want to put this on her?
Beautiful.
Try that.
So, who's the lucky guy?
Toby.
Wait. What did she say?
- Let's go. It's bedtime, girls. Let's go.
- Just having fun.
- Julie...
- Mom.
Come on. I don't want to hear
Toby's name ever again. Okay?
Julie, it's just pretend.
That's it. He's done.
He's not in our lives.
- He's real. Toby is...
- Let's go.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Kristi...
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Take Grandma's stuff off and let's go to bed.
Dennis and I are gonna be right next door, okay?
We're gonna leave a light on and everything, so you can find us, and everything's gonna be...
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.
Love you.
- Good night, guys.
- I love you so much.
When are you gonna stop taping us?
Not until this thing's over.
When's your mom gonna let us sleep in the same bed?
I can't stop thinking about it. I can't.
I know.
Just close your eyes and try to get to sleep.
Come here.
We can share a pillow, too. That's fine.
Julie.
Do you hear that?
Like cars?
- Sorry...
- It's my mom.
She's always up at night.
She can't sleep.
Oh, my God, she's so loud.
Do you want me to go check on her?
She's gonna wake the girls up.
I'll be right back.
Julie?
Julie!
Girls?
Julie?
Hey, Julie!
Hello?
What the fuck?
Julie?
Lois?
What?
What the fuck?
Julie!
What the fuck?
Fuck. Oh, my God.
Julie!
Julie?
What's wrong?
Fuck. Fuck.
Julie?
Get up.
Mommy?
Oh, Kristi! No, Kristi!
- Dennis?
- Come here, come on. Let's go, Kristi.
What happened to Mommy?
Is she okay?
Oh, shit. Come here.
Go, go.
Dennis, I'm scared.
It's okay. No, Kristi, don't talk.
Is Mommy okay?
Quiet, okay?
Be quiet.
Just don't, okay? Just quiet, okay?
It's okay.
Kristi, please, please, be quiet.
I'm gonna go check, okay?
Stay here.
Come on, Kristi.
What was that?
We're gonna get out of here, okay?
Come on, let's go.
I'm scared.
We're gonna get out of here.
Up. Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
I don't know.
Katie!
Katie, get away from there!
Kristi, listen to me, stay right here, okay?
Don't move, okay?
Katie?
Come on, Toby.
Let's get ready.
Previously on Teen Wolf
Someone's controlling him.
You promised this was only gonna be for a few weeks.
Look, just because we're in a trailer does not mean we're trailer park trash.
Exactly.
We're worse.
We don't even have enough money to be in a trailer park.
Don't have a meltdown, okay?
It's probably just the generator.
You mean the thing that runs the electricity and water.
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired of feeling slightly terrified all the time.
It's not like I wanna be.
Hey, look, it's going to get better.

If Jackson doesn't know what he's doing, then he probably
He'd have to forget everything... the murder.
Or he doesn't remember.
What if it's the same kind of thing that happened with
Lydia when she took off from the hospital?
A fugue state? doesn't know someone's controlling him.
Getting rid of the blood.
But he had help with one thing... the video.
And someone else helped him forget that.
Whoever's controlling him.
Are you sure Jackson has no clue about any of this?
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf and that being with
Lydia somehow delayed the whole thing.
So do we try to convince him he's not?
If it helps us find out who's controlling him, then yeah.
Do you think he'll talk to us after what we did?
Yeah, it's us.
He'll talk to us.
Right?
You will not go within 50 feet of Jackson whittemore.
You will not speak to him.
You will not approach him.
You will not assault or harass him physically or psychologically.
[Drops clipboard]
What about school?
You can attend classes while attempting to maintain a 50-foot distance.
Okay, what if we both have to use the bathroom at the same time and there's only two stalls available and they're only right next to each other?
I'll just hold it.
Do I need to remind you how lucky we are that they're not pressing charges?
Oh, come on, it was just a joke.
A joke?
Yes, I didn't think it would be taken this seriously.
Dad, humor's very subjective, okay?
I mean, we're talking multiple levels of interpretation here.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, how exactly am I supposed to interpret the stolen prison transport van, huh?
We filled the tank!
Move!
It's not just this.
Although, a restraining order is a new low that I didn't think that you would reach quite this soon.
It's everything on top of it.
The completely bizarre behavior, the late nights coming home, having to beg Mr. Harris for you to make up that chemistry test that you missed.
I missed a chemistry test?
Really, Scott?
Really?
I have to ground you.
I am grounding you.
You are grounded.
What about work?
Fine... Other than work.
And no TV.
The TV's broken.
Then no computer.
I need the computer for school.
Then no, uh... no Stiles.
What... no Stiles?
No Stiles!
And no more car privileges.
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
[Scoffs]
Oh, for the love of God.
Mom, you want me to...  no.
Mom, come on, let me just... mom.
Mom!
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
Do you really wanna know?
Yeah.
Is this about your father?
It is, isn't it?
Okay, you know what, um...
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
[Stiles sighs]
I'm the worst son ever.
Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either.
Dammit!
You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
You know, the full moon's coming, Derek.
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.
You said you were gonna teach us to change whenever we wanted.
There hasn't been time.
But if you have to lock us up during the full moon, that means you're alone against the argents.
They haven't found us.
Yet!
So how about we forget the Kanima?
We... Can't!
There was something about the way Gerard looked at it.
He wasn't afraid... at all.
I don't know what he knows or what he's planning.
But I'm sure about one thing.
We have to find it first.
It's everything
Lydia could translate.
And trust me, she was very confused.
Yeah, what'd you tell her?
That we were part of an online gaming community that battles mythical creatures.
I am part of an online gaming community that battles mythical creatures.
O-oh.
Great.
Okay, does it say how to find out who's controlling him?
Not really.
But Stiles was right about the murderers.
Yes!
It calls the Kanima a weapon of vengeance.
There's a story in there about this South American priest who uses the Kanima to execute murderers in his village...  all right, see?
So maybe it's not all that bad.
Until the bond grew strong enough that it killed whoever he wanted it to.
All bad, all very, very bad.
Here's the thing, though.
The Kanima's actually supposed to be a werewolf.
But it can't be...  "Until it resolves that in its past which manifested it."
Okay, if that means that
Jackson could use a few thousand hours of therapy, I could've told you that myself.
What if... It has something to do with his parents?
His real parents.
Yeah, does anybody actually know what happened to them?
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so... I'll talk to him myself.
Okay, what do I do?
You have a make-up exam, remember?
Promise me.
If he does anything, you run the other way.
I can take care of myself.
Allison, if you get hurt while
I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me.
If he does anything...  Like?
Anything... Weird or bizarre... anything.
Anything evil!
Ah... Ow!

Oh, you just scared the hell out of me.
Sorry, I wa... I was just, um, I was... nothing.
Ah, that's a... nice heels.
Oh! Yeah, uh, my feet were hurting, so I...  same reason I never wear mine.

Apparently, they've got some big name spinning.
Oh, you mean like a rave?

Yeah.
[Faint gagging]
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
Come on, anyone who ever says "I'm not supposed to tell anyone" is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!
Why do you wanna know?
I can't tell you that.
Then I'm not telling you.
 But you are telling me that could tell me something if you
wanted to tell me?
 Was that a question?
 It felt like a question.
 Well... Tell me if this feels like an answer.
No.
 Jackson?
 In here.
Is something wrong?
 Y-you could've warned me.
 You're the one that walked into the boys' locker room.
 I thought I heard you... I th... forget it.
 Did you wanna talk about something?
 We can talk later.
 No.
Let's talk now.
 Lydia!
Lydia, come on!
Ly... wait!
Ow!
Ah, ah, hey, Erica.
 Why are you asking Lydia about Jackson's real parents?
 Why are you bringing out the claws on camera?
That's right.
You wanna play catwoman?
I'll be your Batman.
 If you're wondering about
Jackson's real parents,
they're about half a mile from here.
In beacon hills cemetery.
 I... I have to get to cl...
 oh, no, no, you don't.
No, you have perfect grades.
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
[Heartbeat thumping]
 [Thinking] Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...  It's him, isn't it?
What?
Who? Him who?
The test didn't work, but it's still him.
It's Jackson.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I... I... I Chang mmi.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story's gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town.
Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself.
Stop it. Just stop!
What are you gonna do, Allison, hmm...
When your stupid bitch of boyfriend turns on you?
They kill your aunt.
They almost kill Lydia.
Who do you really think's gonna be next, hmm?
Not you.
No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love.
Is that what you tell yourself, hmm?
"Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."
Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead.
I just... I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
Actually, he has.
Allison?
What are you doing here?
I... I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I have a restraining order!
Trust me, I restrained myself.

Hi, there.
Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office.
Um, actually... I came here to talk to you.

Well, unbusy yourself.

Fine. You two, over there.
I'm gonna kill him.
No, you're not.
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
No.
You were right, let's kill him.
Oh... No.
Kanima.
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
Me too, but it looks like they are.
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl...
With severely low standards?
[Scoffs] Because
I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
Hey.
What if it's Matt?
I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
So he makes Jackson kill
Isaac's dad, one of argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?
Yes!
Why?
Because... he's evil.
You just don't like him.
The guy... Bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Are you all right?
Hey, you don't look so good.
I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how
Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his
Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18.
So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?
Yep.
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report on my dad's in-box.
He keeps everything.
[On p.A.] Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office.
Jackson!
I'm fine, just give me a minute.
[Pained grunting]
[sighs] Perfect.
Don't forget the dates.
"Passengers arrived at the hospital doa.
The estimated time of death...
9:26 P.M., June 14, 1995."
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.
[Chuckling]
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Uh, yes, I'm leaving.
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
[Pencil sharpener whirring]
The principal wanted to see me?
No... I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah. I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
Uh... No.
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
[Knock on door]
Hello?
[Car keys jingling]
[Shifting gear]
[Engine revving]
It means he was born after his mom died... by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
You okay, dude?
[Shallow breaths]
So was it an accident or not?
The word all over the report is "inconclusive."
Then his parents could have been murdered?
If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth.
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
Or for whoever's controlling him?
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...
[electricity crackling]
Erica!
[Roars]
[Electricity crackling]
[Rumbling]
[Electricity crackling]
[Screams]
[Electricity crackling]
[Roars]
Unh!
[Coughs]
Over here.
[Breathing heavily]
[Grunting]
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
Hey, we need to get her to a hospital.
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital...  to Derek.
[Whispers] To Derek.
Go.
Hey, Scott!
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt... I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go.
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
No, it's not right.
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
Scott, go.
Go.
Okay.
[Gasping]
[Camera motor buzzing]
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
But since you don't have it,
I'm gonna need that kiss.

 [Whimpers]
 Is... Something wrong?
 [Screams]
 Pull her up.
 [Grunting]
 Is she dying?
 She might, I... which is why this is gonna hurt.
[Cracking]
 [Screams]
 You broke her arm!
 [Screams]
 It'll trigger the healing process.
 [Cries]
 I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
[Cracking]
 [Screams]
[Cries]
[Moans]
Stiles... you make a good Batman.
 You know who it is.
 Jackson.
 You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
If you want me in, fine.
But we'll do it on one condition.
We're gonna catch him, not kill him.
 And?
 And we do it my way.
[Baby crying]
 Thank you, Jenna.
Thanks, you guys.
I appreciate it.
[Baby crying]
 Please... you have to tell him.
 It's okay, your baby's fine.
 Not... The baby.
 Okay.
 He killed Sean.
 Honey, the police know.
 They don't...
They didn't see it.
It wasn't human.
 Okay.
All right.
All right.
[Door clicks shut]
[Door clicks open]
 [Breathing rapidly]
Please... no... [muffled cries]
 I'm so sorry, Lydia.
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
Well... not completely.
There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a
strong girl.
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a
minimal amount of post traumatic stress.
Or maybe... a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
[Sighs]
I had a plan, you know.
[Inhales deeply]
It was a good plan.
But if there's one thing that
I've learned in life, it's to
always have a backup.
That would be you.
 [Sighs]
 Your immunity makes you a perfect plan b.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do...
One very important thing.
Do you know what that is, Lydia?
[Roars] Lydia!

Jackson will be there seeking his next target.
[Nails clinging]
 Something that affects the
Kanima affects its master.
 You think we can catch them?
 The one question that might mean everything.
[Guns cocking]
 People are dying, Scott.
[Electricity crackling]
 Who controls the Kanima?
 [Screams]
What am I doing with my life?
I'm so pale. I should get out more.
I should eat better.
My posture is terrible.
I should stand up straighter.
People would respect me more if I stood up straighter.
What's wrong with me?
I just want to connect.
Why can't I connect with people?
Oh, right. It's because I'm dead.
I shouldn't be so hard on myself.
I mean, we're all dead.
This girl is dead. That guy's dead.
That guy in the corner is definitely dead.
Jesus, these guys look awful.
I wish I could introduce myself, but I don't remember my name anymore.
I mean, I think it started with an "R," but that's all I have left.
I can't remember my name, or my parents, or my job.
Although my hoodie would suggest
I was unemployed.
Sometimes I look at the others and try to imagine what they were.
You were a janitor.
You were the rich son of a corporate CEO.
You were a personal trainer.
And now you're a Corpse.
I have a hard time piecing together how this whole apocalypse thing happened.
Could have been chemical warfare or an airborne virus, or a radioactive outbreak monkey.
But it doesn't really matter.
This is what we are now.
This is a typical day for me.
I shuffle around, occasionally bumping into people, unable to apologize or say much of anything.
It must have been so much better before, when everyone could express themselves, and communicate their feelings and just enjoy each other's company.
A lot of us have made our home here at this airport.
I don't know why.
People wait at airports, I guess, but I'm not sure what we're all waiting for.
Oh, man. They call these guys Boneys.
They don't bother us much.
But they'll eat anything with a heartbeat.
I mean, I will too, but at least I'm conflicted about it.
We all become them some day.
At some point you just give up, I guess.
You lose all hope.
After that, there's no turning back.
Oh, man, gross.
Stop. Stop, don't pick at it!
You're making it worse!
Oh, this is what I have to look forward to.
It's kind of a bummer.
I don't want to be this way.
I'm lonely. I'm lost.
I mean, I'm literally lost.
I've never been in this part of the airport before.
Wonder if these guys are lost, too.
Wandering around, but never getting anywhere.
Do they feel trapped?
Do they want more than this?
Am I the only one?
This is my best friend.
By best friend, I mean we occasionally grunt and stare awkwardly at each other.
We even have almost-conversations sometimes.
Days pass this way.
But sometimes we even find actual words. Words like...
Hungry.
And...
City.
Even though we can't communicate, we do share a similar taste in food.
Traveling in packs just kind of makes sense, especially when everyone and their grandmother is trying to shoot you in the head all the time.
God, we move slow.
This could take a while.
Hello, and thank you for your service today.
In the eight years since this plague destroyed our world...
You think we're getting this stuff for the cure?
Since we erected this wall...
No one believes in a cure anymore, Jules.
We have counted on young volunteers like you to gather resources from beyond the wall.
But first, a word of caution.
Corpses look human, they are not.
They do not think. They do not bleed.
Whether they were your mother or your best friend, they are beyond your help.
They are uncaring, unfeeling, incapable of remorse.
Sound like anyone you know, Dad?
Just picture them as this.
As sons and daughters of possibly the sole remaining human settlement on Earth, you are a critical part of what stands between us and extinction.
Therefore you have an obligation to return to us safely.
And if you remember your training, you will.
Good luck, Godspeed, and God bless America.
USA! USA!
Let's go.
Sweet.
Hey, Berg, you gonna help us out or what?
No dice. Almost at level five.
Did you hear that?
I did. We should bail.
Oh, hey, we can't just bail.
We have orders.
Do you have any idea how much medicine the City goes through a month?
We need pharma salvage to survive.
- We can't just abandon our...
- You sound just like my dad.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it wasn't a compliment.
Oh, here, guys. Take some Prozac.
Maybe that will cheer you up.
I told you I heard something.
Per, let's bail.
Perry?
We have orders, Jules.
It was nothing anyway.
- You're being paranoid, okay?
- Perry!
Aim for their heads!
Smile, mother...
Nice watch.
Now, I'm not proud of this.
In fact, I'd appreciate it if you might look away for a moment here.
I don't like hurting people, but this is the world now.
The new hunger is a very powerful thing.
If I don't eat all of him, if I spare his brain, he'll rise up and become a Corpse like me.
But if I do, I get his memories, his thoughts, his feelings.
I'm sorry, I just can't help it.
The brain's the best part.
The part that makes me feel human again.
You like it, Perry?
I don't want to hurt you.
I just want to feel what you felt.
To feel a little better.
A little less dead.
Perry... I think I love you.
Say something.
Don't just say nothing.
No, I...
I think I love you too, Julie.
I miss airplanes.
My mom used to say that it looked like an Etch A Sketch up there.
I like that you remember that kind of stuff.
If we don't, then it will just all be gone.
You know?
Yeah.
The world is so messed up.
Not all of it.
Cheeseball.
Perry?
Perry!
Perry, where are you? Answer me!
Julie...
Safe.
Come...
What?
I don't know what I'm doing.
What's wrong with me?
These other guys would never bring a living person home.
You know why? Because that's crazy!
Right now, they think she's just another one of us.
A new addition to the family.
But they would think I was insane.
If they could think.
Why do I have to be so weird?
What am I doing?
Home...
Not eat.
Keep you safe.
All right.
Maybe I could have thought this through a little more.
But I can tell when a girl needs her space.
There's a lot of ways to get to know a person.
Eating her dead boyfriend's brains is one of the more unorthodox methods, but...
It's a special occasion.
A special occasion, sir?
It's Mom's birthday.
- To Diane.
- To Mom.
Yeah.
- It's Mom's birthday.
- So, Perry,
Julie tells me you've been working in Agriculture.
But tell me you would never consider going to work construction with your father.
You know, on the wall we need good people.
Don't mind him, Per.
Dad's idea of saving humanity is to build a really big concrete box, put everyone in it, and then wait at the door with guns until we grow old and die.
Well, Julie, without the wall, we would be eating brains now
- instead of rice.
- Dad...
This is the only way past the wall.
Otherwise we get stopped.
Okay...
Come on. It's not that bad. Come on.
I haven't heard from him in two days, Jules.
He's on construction detail, Perry.
He's working.
My dad goes weeks without checking in.
Okay. This way.
Hey.
It's gonna be okay.
Dad.
Per.
Hey, hey, hey!
Perry! Come on!
No wonder she's so afraid of me.
I need a different approach.
Okay, here we go. Don't be creepy.
Don't be creepy. Don't be creepy.
What are you doing?
Please leave me alone.
Why me?
Why did you save me?
Don't cry.
Safe.
Keep you safe.
What are you?
I'm hungry.
Just let me go!
Not safe.
Not safe?
Not safe.
Well, then you're just gonna have to go and get me some food.
Because I'm starved.
Please?
I'd be very grateful for some food.
Okay.
God!
Shit.
Don't run.
Come. Safe.
Thank you.
Be dead.
Okay?
That's too much.
Told you not safe.
Yeah, I get that.
I really am hungry, though.
Yes!
My God.
Oh, no. Stop staring.
You're acting weird again.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.
I can't remember the last time I had a beer.
I guess you can't be all that bad, Mr. Zombie.
My name...
You have a name?
What is your name?
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
Rrrr?
This date is not going well.
I want to die all over again.
Rrrrrrr...
Does your name start with "R"?
Robert? Richard?
Randy?
Raphael? Ricardo?
Why don't I just call you "R"?
I mean, that's a start, right?
R...
I want to go home, R.
It's not safe.
I get that.
And look...
I know that you saved my life.
And I'm grateful for that.
But you walked me into this place.
So I know that you can walk me out again.
Oh, no. She can't leave. She just got here.
Tell her she has to wait.
Tell her they'll notice.
Have to wait.
They... They'll notice.
Not bad.
How long?
Few days.
They'll forget.
You'll be okay.
Are there others like you?
I mean, I've...
I've never ever heard a Corpse talk before.
I mean, apart from the groaning.
Okay. A few days?
What am I supposed to do for a few days around here anyway?
This is awesome!
You wanna try?
Oh, God!
You're a leadfoot.
Okay. Okay. Pick a foot.
You're using two feet. Pick one foot...
There you go. Okay...
There you go.
All right. Two hands on the wheel, buddy.
Jesus, R!
This was a beautiful car!
Recalculating.
What's with all the vinyl?
Couldn't figure out how to work an iPod?
Better sound.
You're a purist?
More alive.
Yeah. That's true. Lot more trouble, though.
There you go again. Shrugging.
Stop shrugging, shrugger.
It's a very non-committal gesture.
Really?
These are really cool records.
How did you get all these?
I collect things.
Yeah, I can see that.
You, my friend, are a hoarder.
Man, there's this awesome record store on Main and lvy.
You would love it. It's so cool.
Was so cool.
Alrighty.
Much better.
R? Can I ask you something?
My boyfriend, he died back there.
Will he come back? As one of you?
That's good, I guess.
Something happened to him.
A lot of things happened to him.
But I guess there just came a point where he couldn't absorb any more.
It's just, in my world, people die all the time.
So... You know, it's not like.
I'm not sad that he's gone.
Because I am.
But I think I've been preparing for it for a really long time.
What are you?
Man, it must be nice to sleep.
I wish I could.
I wish I could dream.
But that's not really an option for me.
The dead don't dream.
This is as close as we get.
You sure about this, son?
Welcome, then.
Sorry for your loss.
Me, too.
Give him one and show him how to use it.
Hey, Berg, you gonna help us out or what?
I'm almost at level five.
Did you hear that?
I did. We should bail.
We can't just bail. We have orders.
You sound just like my dad.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it wasn't a compliment.
I told you I heard something.
Perry!
Aim for their heads.
You said a few days.
It's been a few days, R.
I have to go home.
Stay together.
Safe.
What?
Julie.
Living.
Eat!
Oh, my God!
We go.
Eat.
R. Look.
This way.
Come with me.
What?
No!
Want to help her.
Who the hell asked you?
Like her.
It's okay.
I'm sure it is.
- Over there, the garage.
- Hold on.
I'm so happy to see you right now.
You okay?
R?
You drive.
Good idea.
The white zone is for loading and unloading of passengers only.
Jesus, I'm freezing.
I have to pull over.
This is one of the last neighborhoods my dad evacuated.
Maybe these houses have food.
Okay, come on.
Oh, man. It's locked.
Oh, God.
Oh, cool!
Look what they have.
I haven't seen one of these in forever.
Cheese!
It's all right. See?
Yeah.
It's important to preserve memories, you know?
Especially now that the world is on its way out.
Everything you see, you may be seeing for the last time.
Perry used to say that.
Here. Take a picture.
I'm exhausted.
The bed actually isn't too rotten, so I'm gonna go to sleep.
Good night.
R?
Yeah?
I was... I was thinking...
You know, you could sleep in there if you want.
On the floor.
These houses creep me out, so...
Okay.
Do you feel it?
Hey, look up this street.
Holy shit. That's my dad.
Get back!
He would have killed you.
If he saw you, he would have just shot you in the head, and you'd just be gone.
These clothes are soaking still.
I'm gonna lay them out to dry.
Oh, relax.
Holy shit.
Don't look.
Okay.
Holy shit!
Hey.
Do you have to eat people?
Yeah.
Or you'll die?
- Yeah.
- But you didn't eat me.
You rescued me. Like, a bunch.
It must be hard being stuck in there.
You know, I can see you trying.
Maybe that's what people do.
You know, we try to be better.
Sometimes we kind of suck at it.
But I look at you and you try so much harder than any human in my city.
You're a good person, R.
Anyway.
It was me.
What was you?
I mean, I...
I guess I kind of knew that.
You did?
Yeah, I...
I guess I hoped that you didn't.
I'm sorry.
Julie...
I'm so sorry.
Julie...
The dead do not sleep.
If you guys could pick any job in the world...
Pretend that everything was totally different, what would you want to do?
- Nursing.
- Yeah?
Yeah. Healing people and saving lives and...
I don't know, finding a cure.
I like that.
I think someday someone's gonna figure out this whole thing and exhume the whole world.
Exhume? And what does that mean?
Exhume means to, like, revive.
It means to dig up.
As in digging up a corpse.
Whatever.
What the hell are you doing here?
Are you actually dreaming right now?
I'm not sure.
You can't dream, Corpse.
Dreaming is for humans.
Chill out, Per. He can dream if he wants to.
What about you, R?
What do you want to be?
I don't know. I don't even know what I am.
Well, you can be whatever you want.
Isn't that what they say?
We can, right? You and me?
It's not gonna happen, loverboy.
Not after you told her you ate her ex.
Shrug.
So much for dreaming.
You can't be whatever you want.
All I'll ever be is a slow, pale, hunched-over, dead-eyed zombie.
What did I think was gonna happen?
That she'd actually want to stay with me?
It's hopeless.
This is what I get for wanting more.
I should just be happy with what I had.
Things don't change. I need to accept that.
It's easier not to feel.
Then I wouldn't have to feel like this.
Identify yourself!
It's just me, Kevin. It's okay. I'm fine.
Just stop right there.
It's okay. I'm not infected.
I said stop, Julie!
Okay. Fine. Fine.
Let me check you out.
- Is she okay?
- Clear, sir.
Hi, Dad.
I sent a half a dozen units out looking for you.
Nora said you were taken into...
Yeah, I was. But I escaped.
I was holed up in a house in the suburbs and then I found a car, so I came here.
Julie, are you sure nothing bit you?
Do I look infected to you, Dad?
We have to be safe.
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm fine, though. I promise.
I thought I lost you.
Well, you didn't, Dad. I'm here.
Welcome home.
Yeah. Good to be back.
So I'm just gonna go home.
I'm gonna blend in.
I'm gonna stop thinking so much.
I'm gonna forget about her, just like I forgot about everything else.
I'm gonna... Oh, shit, am I cold?
Is that what this is?
Corpses don't get cold.
Yo!
What are you doing here?
Boneys. They chased me out.
Came to find you.
Where is she?
Went home.
You okay?
No.
Bitches, man.
Boneys looking for you.
And her.
You started something.
I saw pictures last night.
Memories.
My mom...
Summertime.
Cream of Wheat.
A girl.
A dream?
A dream.
We are changing, I think.
We are.
I have to tell her.
Will you help?
Help?
Exhume?
Exhume.
They said:
"Fuck, yeah!"
Wait here.
Be careful. Okay?
So I'll wait here.
It's not that bad. Come on.
Julie and I were giving the others hope.
And it was spreading fast.
I guess the Boneys didn't like that.
That must be why they're looking for us.
I have to tell Julie.
I have to explain what's happening before it's too late. I have to...
Oh, no. Oh, no. Please, go!
Go with your friends! Leave me!
That's it! Okay.
No, I'm serious, Nora.
I mean, "Corpse" is just...
It's just a stupid name that we came up with for a state of being that we don't understand.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
What is wrong with me?
Okay.
I've got to tell you something.
This is kind of weird.
- Please do not freak out.
- No.
But I actually miss him.
- You... You miss him?
- I know, it's so stupid.
- Like you're attracted to him?
- No, I don't...
Like he could be your boyfriend?
Your zombie boyfriend?
I mean, I know it's really hard to meet guys right now with the apocalypse and stuff, trust me.
And look, I know that you miss Perry.
Okay? But, Julie, this is weird.
Like, I wish the Internet was still working so I could just look up whatever it is that's wrong with you.
Shut up.
All right.
Okay. I'm getting ready for bed.
Hey.
I'm glad you're back.
Yeah.
Have sweet dreams about your zombie.
All right.
Julie.
Julie!
Oh, my God.
R!
What are you doing here?
Came to see you.
R...
You can't just do that. It's dangerous.
Grigio, shut up! I'm trying to sleep!
Sorry!
Jesus, R, are you crazy?
The people here, they're not like me.
If they see you, you'll get killed.
Do you understand that?
Yes.
- Are you talking to yourself?
- No!
Okay, seriously, what is going on out here, Julie?
Oh, my God! Is that him?
Yeah.
'Sup?
I'm sorry.
I know. I'm sorry, too.
I actually missed you.
Me, too.
It's funny. You feel warmer than I remember.
That's the patrol.
Come on, we better get you inside.
Come on.
You're lucky my dad got pulled into some emergency thing.
You're safe here tonight, R.
After that, I don't know what we're gonna do.
How did you die?
I don't remember.
How old are you?
Because you could be twenty-something, but you could also be a teenager.
- You have one of those faces.
- Oh, my God.
And I can't even smell...
You don't smell...
He doesn't smell rotten.
- I don't...
- Amazing.
Nora, he didn't come here for an interview. Stop.
Why did you come here, R?
To show everyone...
Show them what?
That we can change.
R, no one here is ever gonna buy that.
Not that we could get you even close enough to tell them.
As soon as they saw you, they would blow your head to bits.
Wait a minute. Did you say "we"?
Lots of us changing.
Dreaming.
That's kind of a big deal.
We have to move fast.
What do you mean?
Boneys chasing me. They're chasing us.
Okay, we have to go to my dad.
No, that is a very bad idea.
No, Nora, he was a reasonable guy once.
Oh, no, I think you're confused.
It was your mom that was the reasonable one.
It was your dad that grounded you for a year for stealing Peach Schnapps.
Are you serious? It's your dad that likes to shoot Corpses in the head.
Well, what other choice do we have, Nora?
Still, we'd have to get him through the city.
Someone would definitely see you.
There isn't much time.
We could fix him up.
What?
I have some makeup that I was saving for a special occasion that obviously isn't gonna happen.
Yeah. Yeah, we could.
We could put on a little bit of foundation, maybe a little blush.
Probably a lot of blush.
No way.
Yeah, way.
Would you change the song, please?
What? It's funny.
No, it's not.
Fine.
There we go.
Oh, yeah.
Hold up...
You look hot!
What?
Nothing.
It's just, you look nice.
I don't know how my dad's gonna be.
He gets kind of crazy. This might not work.
Hey.
No matter what, we stay together.
We're changing everything.
I know.
Stay together. Promise.
I promise.
Come on.
Hey, it's game time. All right, let's do this.
Excuse me.
Where are you guys headed?
To see my dad, Kevin.
Miss Grigio, I can't let you guys in.
We're on high alert around here.
- Why? What's going on?
- It's classified.
All right, well, we have our own classified business, so come on.
Hey.
Say something human.
Say something human.
How are you?
Nailed it.
Over here. He's fine.
Okay, you guys wait here.
What are you doing here?
What is going on? What is all this?
I'm not sure, but it's not good.
We've been getting reports there are sizable packs of skeletons and Corpses coming toward us.
We don't know why, but if they're here to attack, there's nothing we can do about it.
Too many of them, too few of us.
So I want you to get home, lock down the house.
I have the gun there, the Ruger SR...
This? Yeah, okay. I need to talk to you.
- Julie, not now.
- Dad, it's important.
This is gonna sound really crazy, but
I think the dead are coming back to life.
That does sound crazy.
They're changing, Dad. They're...
I don't know.
They're somehow curing themselves.
You think they're curing themselves?
How is that?
I saw it. It is really happening.
No. You know what is happening, Julie?
What's happening is every day there are more of them and less of us.
They are not curing themselves.
We're their food source.
They are not becoming vegan.
Okay? They don't eat broccoli.
They eat brains, your mother's and your boyfriend's included.
Okay? So I want you to wake up!
- I'll explain.
- Okay?
What do you mean, "you'll explain"?
Explain what?
I got this.
Get yourself home.
Barricade yourself in the shelter.
There is enough stuff there that you can open up...
Hi.
Who are you?
This is R.
I didn't ask you. I asked him. Who are you?
You're a Corpse?
He saved my life.
He took care of me.
I triggered something in him and that must have sparked something in all of them...
- Now it's triggered something in me.
- No...
Dad! No! Dad!
We want to help.
Please, they don't want to attack us.
They want to help.
We're... We're getting better.
No. Things don't get better.
Things get worse.
People get bit, then they get infected, then I shoot them in the head.
- No, Dad...
- That's what happened to your mother, and that's what's gonna happen to him.
I'm really sorry, Mr. Grigio.
Go. Get out of here and be safe, no matter what. Okay?
Julie...
I have to go.
You're not gonna shoot me.
Yes. Yeah, I will. Totally.
Okay. That could have gone better.
I need to warn my friends.
- Where?
- The stadium...
Shit! Come on! Get on the subway!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry.
Coming through.
R.
Julie.
Hi.
Ready for a fight.
Yeah, I can see that.
Soldiers coming. Boneys closing in.
They're here now.
- Keep them out.
- We will.
Run.
This way, come on!
Sir, your daughter is with the Corpse.
I've got eyes on them.
Thank you.
Who the hell do we shoot?
This asshole.
Hi.
Hey. Hi. Hi.
We see Corpses fighting skeletons, sir.
Copy that. We're seeing that over here, too.
Sorry, can you repeat that?
Copy that. We're seeing
Corpses fighting skeletons, sir.
Shit!
It's over.
No. Keep you safe.
It will be okay.
R?
R!
R, please?
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Next one's the head.
Move away from him, Julie.
No!
Julie, move now.
Dad, you have to listen to me.
I know we lost everybody.
I know you lost Mom.
But you and me, we are still here.
We can fix all this. We can start over.
They need our help.
Please, Dad! Look at him.
He's different. He's...
Bleeding.
He's bleeding, Dad.
Corpses don't bleed!
Oh, God.
You're alive. He's alive!
You're alive.
Does it hurt?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Sir?
This is Colonel Grigio.
The situation has changed.
Let's get you two the hell out of here.
Are you still bleeding?
- Yes.
- Good.
Sorry.
On the one hand, getting shot in the chest hurt.
Like, a lot.
But on the other, it felt good to bleed, to feel pain.
To feel love.
I wish I could say we cured the Boneys with love, but really, we just straight up killed them all.
It sounds kind of messed up, but no one felt too bad about it.
They were too far gone to change.
It was actually a really good bonding experience for us and the humans.
Once we joined forces, they didn't stand a chance.
The ones we didn't kill just wasted away.
And the rest of us?
Well, we kind of learned how to live again.
For a while, it seemed like a lot of us forgot what that meant.
The humans began to accept us, connect with us, teach us.
This was the key to the cure.
It was scary at first, but every great thing starts out a little scary, doesn't it?
This is how it happened.
This is how the world was exhumed.
You need some help?
Yeah.
I have zombie fingers.
Thank you.
Here.
Oh, it's okay. I don't mind the rain.
I insist.
I'm...
Marcus.
Emily.
You're... You're very pretty.
Thank you, Marcus.
Now you're supposed to say I'm pretty, too.
R?
Yeah?
Do you remember your name yet?
No.
Well, you know, you could just give yourself one.
Just pick one. Whatever you want.
I like "R."
Really?
You don't want to know what it was?
You don't want your old life back?
No.
I want this one.
Just "R," huh?
Just "R."
(MAN) Now listen. Tell Simon that
Tommy has the plans and the model.
I'll be back in about ten days, and I can take over then.
Well, it's all come at a bad time, really.
Dan? Hello?
It always happens in the same place.
Quite convenient, actually.
You're having a few days away from the wee ones, are you?
Er, just a bit of peace and quiet, really.
You're going to the right place for that, boy.
There you go.
Now, the CB goes straight through to me.
If you need help, just call.
I'll be over on Saturday unless I hear from you. OK?
- Thank you, Doug.
- Thanks, Doug.
Be good!
Kate! I was thinking we'd go for a walk.
Maybe after breakfast?
- Kate?
- Uh-huh?
I was thinking we could do that walk.
You know the one? Around the coast?
- (TYPING)
- Let's just see how I go with this, OK?
OK. Yeah.
(GASPS) Oh...
You OK?
Ready?
- Aw, no, they're babies!
- What are you talking about?
We'll grill these two feckers on toast with a bit of lemon, and mwah!
- Come on, bring them in.
- Ah... le poisson!
Wow.
Look at that.
Mm.
- 2002, huh?
- Mm-hm.
All right. I'll get rid of these.
Shit!
Oh, great.
- How was it?
- It was a cold bath.
Doug'll be here in the morning.
He'll sort it out.
Good.
I don't recall it giving us any trouble last time.
It's a while since you've been here, though.
Now, she's full of character,
I'll give you that.
She's never down for long.
No, I tried that, mate. It didn't work.
- There we are.
- (STEADY WHIR)
You've got to keep it down for a count of three.
- Ah.
- Keep it down hard, mind.
To kick-start her again, read these and that'll do the trick. Good man.
Right.
Oh! I almost forgot.
- There's a present from Mrs. Doug.
- Ah!
Now, she baked them specially, so watch your teeth.
That's very kind.
Tell her thanks very much from us.
Not much for her to do up this part of the world. It's that, or talk to me.
- And I tell you, I'm never short of cake.
- (CHUCKLES)
- How are you getting on here, you two?
- Good.
Not gone mad yet?
No, we love this island.
We've had some good times here.
You've found them again, have you?
- Right, I'll see you later, Martin.
- Great. Thanks a million, Doug. Bye.
Kate?
- Kate, I was calling you.
- Hang on a second!
Just give me a minute, OK?
Well... the dinner's on the table.
Martin!
- Martin!
- Yeah! I'm down here.
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's gone again.
That's a good look.
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
I was just running a bath, and it just went.
- Any luck.
- No.
I've held it down for three.
That doesn't seem to be working.
So it says, "Use a ratchet screwdriver.
"Make sure the isolating switch on the front of the generator is off.
We have an " intermittent malfunction of the cut-out".
Yeah, definitely got that.
Yeah.
What the fuck is a ratchet screwdriver?
Shit!
- (GROANS)
- Doug, Martin's been injured.
The generator practically blew up on him. Over.
It's a hairy old thing, but I didn't know it had gone that bad. Over.
Doug, it's... Don't worry.
Aye, well, I'll bring my doctor over anyway.
It'll be tomorrow now. Don't touch the generator until we get there. Over.
All right.
Thanks, Doug. See you. Over and out.
Over and out.
There's absolutely nothing.
I guess I'll try and call him on the CB again.
Yeah. It's just impossible to cook on a fire.
Er... are you OK with bread and cheese?
It's fine, Kate. I'll sort it out.
What are you doing?
I was getting some wood and I found this thing.
We've waited all day and Doug hasn't turned up.
It's getting dark.
We've got to sort this out.
Doug, this is the Fairweather Cottage. Over.
(SIGHS) Come on.
This is the Fairweather Cottage. Over.
If you'd just calm down...
Could we row to him?
Could we row to the mainland?
- It's miles away. It's freezing.
- OK. So we could be just stranded here.
Please don't be silly. Come on.
What did we think, coming back here?
Coming back to the same place, like we're gonna just solve all our problems.
I don't see what that has to do with this.
Come on, Martin, this is just torture, being back here!
Kate!
I'm really trying my best here.
If you want me to apologize again, I will.
I am so... so sorry... I wasn't there.
I'm sorry the power went out, I'm sorry the fucking generator exploded.
I'm sorry for bringing us back here.
I'm sorry for all of it.
You didn't even want him.
Jesus Christ. Please...
Martin!
There's someone here! I just saw them!
(MARTIN) This is Fairweather Cottage on Blackholme Island.
We need to report an injured man.
We need medical assistance, please.
Over and out.
Doug, if you can hear us, this is
Martin and Kate. Please contact us.
Just think for a second.
OK, he just...
He's got to have come on a boat from the mainland.
Then the boat would be at the beach.
You go, and I'll stay with the CB.
OK, I'll be back.
(WHISPERS) Shit.
No boat. Nothing.
What?
Fucking hell.
Maybe we should just go. Let's just go.
Kate, listen. There's no boat, there's no way out, there's nothing.
- (WHISPERS) A fucking gun!
- I know.
- OK, we have to get it off him.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Listen, Kate.
- No.
If he's from the military, he'll understand.
If he's not in the military, we don't know who the hell he is.
OK.
Go. Bedroom.
- (CLANG)
- (GASPS)
Water. I need some water.
I need some water.
What happened?
I was making a crossing in some rough water and my boat got sucked into the rocks.
Please.
Martin!
You OK?
Er...
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
Private Jack Coleman.
Tactical Response.
Martin Kennedy.
Thank you both for taking me in.
- His boat sank.
- I was trying to avoid those rocks.
And as I was saying to...
- I'm Kate.
...Kate.
The tides in that water...
I just remember the rocks and the water coming in.
Are you Army? Navy?
Army.
We're doing a reconnaissance exercise in the area.
Do you think they're looking for you?
Yeah.
Does your CB work?
Er... No, actually. It's been down for the last two days. I can't...
I can't get through to the owner, Doug.
He set it to his frequency but I haven't been able to get through.
Maybe you could have a look.
I should be able to fix it.
So it's just the two of you?
On the island?
Yes.
Yes. Doug is... Doug is the owner.
He's on the mainland.
Ah.
It's just in there.
And there's a bathroom opposite.
- Do you think you need anything else?
- I don't think so, no. Thank you.
- Get some rest.
- Thanks.
I need to speak with you alone.
Are you going to give it to him?
No.
No.
Erm... I'm just gonna go talk to him for a sec.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
What... What are you doing?
Do you want to take a seat for me,
Martin?
No, actually, I'm fine.
I'm gonna tell you something, and you're gonna listen.
And then you're gonna do as I say.
These three things are essential to the safety of you and your wife.
Do you understand me so far?
Yeah.
There's been an outbreak.
A global pandemic that started in South America.
R1N16. Argromoto flu.
It's a highly contagious airborne virus that attacks respiratory systems.
From those infected there are no survivors.
It's fatal and it's spreading rapidly.
It's only a matter of time before it's here.
If your radio was working you'd have heard the broadcasts.
Now, our best defense is to make this place safe.
- Am I going too quickly for you?
- Wait, wait. What...
What exactly are you telling me?
I'm telling you that a highly contagious and fatal disease is on its way here, and we need to protect ourselves.
The official line on this from the military is to stay inside and seal up your home for the best chance of survival.
We need to start now.
How come you don't have it?
Eh? How come you don't have it?
I don't have it... because of my airtight suit and respirator, courtesy of the British Army.
I'm not fuckin' around, Martin.
The Army's known about this for weeks.
We tried to contain it, but this thing's just uncontrollable.
So we've all been deployed to maintain order.
Yeah? So where's your fucking suit, huh?
When my boat sank, it was either ditch the lot or drown.
(KATE) Martin?
You don't want your wife contracting this.
Believe me.
I don't wanna have to hurt anyone.
- What's going on?
- It's fine, Kate.
Come here.
Just come. Come here.
- Martin, you're shaking!
- He can hear.
He's just told me there's a disease out there, a pandemic.
- It's killing everybody...
- What?!
He's got to seal the place up.
That's what he told me.
- (BANGING)
- He has to seal the house up against it.
- OK, enough.
- Look... Kate!
Hey!
We would know if there was a disease.
Doug would have come and told us.
Hopefully, for his sake, he's been sealing up his house like everyone else.
This is bullshit.
This is bullshit!
If you want to go, go.
But do it before I seal this place up.
Once that door is shut... it's not opening again.
He's fucking crazy.
We should just get our things and go.
Kate...
I have no idea what is actually going on out there.
All that I know... is that for the moment we are stuck on this island.
We're surrounded by freezing water and there's nowhere else to go.
I want to go home.
And I'm not staying here with him.
We have that.
We have his gun.
Now all we can do is play along and keep him sweet until I can figure out exactly what's going on.
Because I don't want to see anybody get hurt.
(WHISPERS) Martin!
Martin!
- (HAMMERING CLOSE BY)
- (CHEERY WHISTLING)
Morning.
Kettle's on if you want some tea.
- This is Kate of Fairweather Cottage.
- (HAMMERING)
Doug, this is Kate...
The battery works but it's not receiving anything. I checked it last night.
Doug? This is Martin and Kate.
Do you read us? Over.
I'll need to take a look at that generator as well because your power's out.
- Why have you barricaded the door?
- To stop people bringing the infection.
I thought it was against the risk of a virus.
Everything we do here is to minimize the risk, not just of the virus but of people trying to escape it.
I was gonna ask you, do you have any weapons in the house?
- Hunting rifle, anything like that?
- No.
Anything we can use to defend ourselves?
No, we don't have anything like that here.
Then I'm gonna have to improvise.
Get something out of that and give me a hand.
And the tinned food in the kitchen needs organizing.
Martin!
How do you know that we haven't got it?
We've been outside.
You don't have it.
That fucker doesn't hang around.
- You breathe it in, you cough it out.
- That's the first symptom? A cough?
Uh-huh. You breathe the microbes into your lungs, they attack the host cells, which is you.
You cough those out and then the rest comes out as liquid.
We just...
We need to contact our families.
We need to...
You said you'd fix the CB.
There's nothing out there for you anymore.
Now I need your help. You can start by sorting the food in the kitchen.
Go fuck yourself!
Help me shift this against the door.
She's got a lot of fire for a little thing, hasn't she?
Personally I like my women like that, but for you it must be hard, her being the boss.
Are you sure you can handle it? Yeah?
Martin...
Start on those chairs, yeah?
Good start.
- I'm going to try the CB.
- Knock yourself out.
This is Fairweather Cottage.
Can someone read me? Over.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
Do you have kids?
Obviously not.
Really? I thought you and Martin would have had them by now.
It's none of your business.
Is it me you're afraid of?
You don't need to be afraid, Kate.
Me and Martin will get this place taken care of.
We'll seal it up and it'll just be the three of us.
Like a family.
Kate?
Label it. Better get started on upstairs.
Shh. There are people here.
There's two or three of them.
When they saw the cottage they hit the ground.
Come on. Come on.
Get down.
I only saw two or three but there's probably more waiting on the shore.
We cannot let them in here.
Get down.
Get back.
Fuck.
They know we're here.
Here.
Pick it up.
Fucking pick it up, mate.
Martin!
Martin!
Jack, here's your gun.
Get down.
Slide it over.
Slide it over.
You're gonna take that side. Yeah?
Stay away from the windows. Go!
Martin! Take this.
- We're all armed in here!
- Jack!
Jack... Jack!
- (KATE) Martin...
- Kate, get down!
They heard the shots and they're heading for the shore.
They're gone?
For now.
There was people outside, Kate.
There was people!
Tell her, Jack.
They'll be back.
We have to be on our guard from now on at all times.
You did good.
Ah!
So your base, is it near here?
Yeah.
What's it called?
- The base?
- What's the base called?
It's called Goose Bay.
You're trying to figure that one out, are you?
She's all fucking confused.
Fuck me.
If you're finished with your questions
I'm gonna get on.
That was champion.
How can you sit there and not say anything?
Maybe if you could resist antagonizing him at every opportunity...
What would you suggest?
What's your big fucking plan, Martin?
There are ways, Kate. But you don't just bulldoze in every time.
You're right.
We should just give him the gun back, just let him take over.
I don't think so!
We can't have her jeopardizing our safety.
You do understand that, don't you?
We need to work together.
You and me. Yeah?
'Cause we can't have her making the fucking decisions.
Yeah?
It's getting cold, isn't it?
I'll take a look at that generator for you.
But I might need a hand.
I can help.
I'd appreciate that.
Yeah.
Would you pass me the screwdriver there?
- That one?
- That's the one.
- It's not going to work.
- What?
I said it's not... going to work.
- He thinks it just...
- Just needs rewiring.
The connection's fucked.
You want to get the fire going?
Why don't you go and do that?
Shine the light here.
- What are you trying to do, Kate?
- We fixed the generator.
I'm not talking about the fucking generator.
I'm playing along.
I'm still here, Kate.
- There's hot water.
- Please don't fucking do this.
Did Martin say you could borrow his stuff?
I didn't think he would mind.
- Smells good.
- Those need cutting.
I'm your man.
Have you been in the Army long?
I signed up when I was 18.
So that's... six, seven years.
Six or seven years.
I saw that scar on your arm.
No, that was just a friendly disagreement, that.
I wondered if it was painful.
Are you married?
I was, once. Yeah.
No kids?
Didn't get the chance.
Why's that?
The disease saw to that.
Oh.
What was she like?
Your wife.
She...
She'd been through a lot.
Tried to put a brave face on it, but really she was just fragile.
Probably deserving of a better man.
Slim, petite.
Dark skin, dark hair.
She was beautiful.
She was funny, too.
Sounds nice.
She was out of my league, really.
Oh... I wouldn't say that.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Ow.
- What were you doing?
- I was just...
- Oh, my God!
- Were you trying to be nice?
- You're breaking my arm.
- To get the gun?
Or were you just desperate?
How long has it been, Kate?
How long has it been since he gave you what you want?
- Please... Ow!
- It's all right.
Just a friendly disagreement.
But mention my wife again and it won't be. Understand?
I'm sorry.
(WHISPERS) If I really wanted what's in your pants,
I'd just take it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I read your little article, too.
I wouldn't leave that shit lying around if I were you.
He really doesn't know you at all, does he?
I need to tell you something.
I... haven't... been honest with you.
I...
I stopped taking the pill.
That's how I got pregnant.
It wasn't an accident.
You kept saying you weren't ready.
(SOBS) I'm sorry.
- (KATE) This is all my fault.
- (SIGHS)
I'm so...
- I love you.
- I love you.
We'll fix this.
Kate and I are leaving now, Jack.
We're gonna risk it outside... because we just really need to see our families.
But we don't want any more trouble.
You're a fuckin' piece of work, you, aren't you?
Hm?
Have you told him?
Why don't you tell Martin what I read?
He knows everything.
Everything.
I see.
It's over, Jack.
I'm just going to take those boards down, and we're gonna take our stuff and we're gonna go.
- (GUNSHOTS)
- (SCREAMS)
- Please, no! Please!
- Move!
- Kate!
- Over there!
Get down. Down on the floor.
On your knees!
Go ahead.
Face on the floor.
Put your face on the floor.
Martin... (SOBS)
Repeat after me.
We aren't going anywhere.
- Say it!
- (SCREAMS)
- Say it!
- We are not going anywhere.
We are not... going anywhere. Please...
It's just the three of us.
- It's OK, Kate. It's OK.
- (SOBBING)
- Say it.
- It's just the three of us.
- Martin...
- It's OK.
Please... (CRIES OUT)
You had the chance to leave and you didn't take it.
Morning.
Do you want to make me some breakfast, sweetheart?
It's all ready for you.
Did you write in this?
Yeah.
A journalist and an architect.
"Will never forget this place.
"Will be back.
"Oh, yes, we will be back."
That was back in 2002.
- (YELLS)
- Drop it! Drop it!
Kate, drop it. It's OK, it's OK.
- Drop it or I'll blow his fuckin' head off!
- Don't fucking touch him!
Why would you do that?!
I'm just trying to be fucking civil!
- We know what you are!
- Yeah? Do you wanna tell me?
- Jack...
- Tell me what I am!
She's fucking scared, man!
For fuck's sake!
She's fucking scared, man.
Is it that fucking hard for us all just to fucking get along?!
Is it?!
Out! Move!
- Are they dry yet?
- Yeah. Almost. Almost done, I think.
He's coming.
Quick! Stow it.
Both of you downstairs.
- What for?
- Downstairs!
Move!
Come on.
- Pick it up!
- Martin.
- What's wrong with him?
- Just give me a second.
- He's having an asthma attack.
- Just a minute.
- Honey, where's your inhaler?
- Bedroom.
- Uh-uh! We all go.
- (RASPING)
Give the man a fuckin' hand.
(WHEEZING) It's OK. It's OK.
Put your hands up!
Hands up where I can see 'em!
Put your hands up!
Where'd you put the inhaler?
Bathroom?
Stop! Wait!
Move.
Put your hands in the air.
Put your hands in the air!
Put your fucking hands up!
OK. Take the gun, Kate.
- What?
- Take the gun.
- Let go, Jack.
- Hm?
Let the fucking gun go.
Let it go.
- You've been outside.
- Yeah, and I saw Doug's body
- and his wife's body!
- I told you people were here.
- Who did that, Jack?
- I told you...
- (CLICKS)
- It's empty.
OK. I got him.
Just come back towards me.
Back you come.
Keep coming. Keep going.
- You finally took control, then?
- Stop talking to me.
He didn't strike me as a man with a gun, but I bet you like that.
- She likes a man with a gun.
- Shut the fuck up! Shut up!
Huh?
That's not bad for an architect.
Just keep going.
What are you gonna do now, huh?
What's your big fuckin' plan?
You have no idea, do you?
You're gonna shoot me?
Martin.
Stop it!
I would fucking do it.
I knew you had it in you.
Good for you.
Good for you.
All right. We're going to tie him up.
Tie him.
That's a good idea there.
- Hands behind your back.
- Turn around!
- You fuckin' people...
- Put your hands behind your back.
- You're doing a good job.
- Tie him up!
Martin.
- That's it.
- (COUGHING)
That's the first symptom.
He's got it.
He's got the fucking disease.
There is no fucking disease!
Martin! Oh, my God!
I fuckin' told you!
Does that look like fuckin' asthma to you?!
He's been outside. He's got the disease.
Get the door open, Kate.
- What have you done to him?
- Nothing.
He went outside and breathed the air when I told him not to!
Jack, please, get him some help.
- This is all the help he's gonna need.
- You fuck! No!
Oh, fuck.
You don't want Kate to have to see you like this.
I'll tell her you went quickly.
Yeah?
Won't be long till it's just the two of us.
He needs help.
We need to get him help!
Oh, yeah? You think someone out there is gonna help us? Huh?
You go out there and it's bam! Yeah?
Put your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.
- He's not dying here.
- We're already dead!
From the moment...
- You killed him.
- (COUGHING)
Martin... Martin.
Martin...
I'm gonna get us help.
I'm gonna find a way. OK?
- And we're gonna get out of here.
- (WHEEZES)
This is Fairweather Cottage.
Blackholme Island.
There are three people known... to be dead, and there's one ser... seriously injured.
This is an urgent call for help.
This is Blackholme Island,
Fairweather Cottage.
We need help.
There are three people known...
Jack.
We don't care what's out there.
We... we don't want to die here.
The disease isn't outside.
It's in here.
It's right here.
You liar!
Agh!
Who the fuck are you?
And I want the truth.
My husband's dying.
Tell me.
They gave me a choice.
Do time in prison, or go to a military hospital.
At the hospital they started testing these new drugs.
I was a lab rat.
They lied to me!
And they filled me full of this shit.
They gave me this fatal fuckin' disease.
They gave it to me.
- You escaped?
- No.
Then they just let me walk away.
They made a mistake.
They discharged me when they shouldn't have done.
Then my wife came by the training centre to pick me up.
How was I supposed to know
I was contagious?
I gave it to her.
I gave it to my wife.
I killed her.
Why should I believe you?
Did you kill Doug and his wife?
Did you?
They found me in their boat shed.
I had to get off the mainland and make a crossing.
I knew that I was the carrier.
So I made them take me out to sea.
They got it really quick.
Maybe because they were older, but...
What would you have done?
What would you have done?
You knew we'd be infected.
You knew it wasn't outside.
It was in you.
You took me in.
You took me in. I couldn't stop that.
But I couldn't let you go outside and risk infecting others. I had to contain it.
I had to contain me!
But I swear to you...
I never wanted to kill anyone.
Oh, my love...
It's gonna be... It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine. Don't...
What have you done to us?
You knew it worked.
I couldn't have you contacting anyone.
...members of the public. An armed and dangerous man has escaped from a secure military compound in your area.
Private Jack Coleman was last seen wearing green combat fatigues.
Under no circumstances should you approach him.
Avoid any contact.
Report all sightings to the authorities.
This is a high-alert open military broadcast to all members of the public.
- An armed and dangerous man...
- You tell them.
I can't do that.
(SHAKILY) I can't do that.
You tell them what you've done.
Do it!
This isn't gonna bring Martin back.
You tell them what you've done.
This isn't gonna help us!
Come in. Come in. Over.
Come in. Come in. Over.
(FEMALE) This is HMS Walker.
Please identify yourself.
If you have come into contact with Private Coleman and have any symptoms of infection, we have an antiviral vaccine.
Now you believe me, that is lies.
They want you to hear that!
That's not true!
We have a vaccine.
No, Kate...
- Martin could have been saved.
- No. There is no vaccine for this.
They didn't even know what it is I have!
They just want to know where we are so they can come and kill us both!
Please believe me.
We're never gonna leave this island.
We'll never leave it.
ENGLISH SDH www.sdimedia.com
What are you gonna do this weekend?
- I don't know. What are you doing?
- It's none of your business.
Did you finish that thing for your Lit class?
No. It's due in like two weeks or something.
Oh, sweet Jesus in the morning.
Again with these people?
He's burnin' in hell!
Because, if what the framers of our constitution mean...
What, Travis? Fifteen minutes?
If you prick me, do I not bleed?
Where you been?
I was dropping my grandma off at the airport... and on the way back the Five-Pointers blocked up Lennox Hill.
Oh, so Abin Cooper's after you too now?
Yeah, and I ain't even gay.
Nah, you're not gay. You're just curious.
If anybody would know, it would beJarod.
What?
All right, all right, all right.
So every once in a while we add amendments to the Constitution... to expand, or more importantly, define, the parameters of our rights.
Like the First Amendment... which Abin Cooper practiced this morning on Lennox, making Travis late.
Those people are such assholes.
Okay. I'm gonna let that ride because this is a passionate issue... and because, yes, they are assholes.
Wait. Who's Abin Cooper?
He's that creepy church guy... that's always saying how God's all pissed off at everybody.
Yeah, him and his family are the ones... that are always holding up signs outside of funerals and stuff.
This was they were protesting the funeral... of the gay kid who got killed two weeks ago.
Yeah. Jacob Harlow.
He went here.
I didn't teach him, but he went here.
It was all over the news, right?
Jessie, I am both happy and sad... that you don't know who Abin Cooper is... but, I mean, come on.
Abin Cooper and the Five Points Trinity Church... they're like right in our own backyard.
Come on, Mrs. Vasquez,
Cooper's Dell is like 30 minutes away.
Yeah. Too close.
Abin Cooper holds our entire state up for ridicule.
All right?
Ultraconservatives avoid this guy.
Did you know last year the head of the largest neo-Nazi faction in this country... issued a statement distancing his politics... from Cooper's and Five Points'?
Even the Nazis think this guy is "nuckin' futs."
All right, let's just hope that the Cooper clan sticks with the First Amendment...
- Why?
- And stays away from the Second Amendment.
- What is the Second Amendment?
- We get guns.
What is this, man?
It's like Craigslist for people who want to get fucked.
I thought Craigslist was Craigslist for people who want to get fucked.
What kinda dirty shit you lookin' at, boy?
Fuck, faggot!
Touch my dick again and see what happens.
- Such an animal.
- They're all the same, man.
- You can't see any faces.
- Oh, shit. You showin' him?
Dude, get your fuckin' flappers outta here.
Yeah, look, it doesn't matter.
You can see the tits.
You can see the fuckin' pussy, man.
Fuck the faces.
How we know we wanna fuck the face unless we can see what they look like?
- Right, thank you.
- You fuckin' bag their head, man. All right?
Look, these bitches wanna fuck.
Even if they do wanna fuck, they're all in New York and LA.
Lots more in LA Look...
New York. LA.
- Road trip.
- LA.
- LA...
- I get the point, all right, but look.
This one's a little closer to home.
Holy shit! Cooper's Dell?
- Let me see.
- No fuckin' way!
We're gettin' laid, boys.
How do we know she's gonna fuck us, or even one of us?
I've been talking back and forth with one for two weeks now.
She says she's interested.
Fuckin'...
I just got a little hard.
I don't wanna fuckin' fuck some chick that he just stuck his dick in.
- Look, look...
- His greasy-assed fuckin' dick.
It's not greasy.
There ain't gonna be no sloppy seconds, boy, okay?
She wants to fuck all three of us at the same time.
- Jesus Christ.
- I call the ass.
You're not gettin' the fuckin' ass.
What if this turns out to be one of them
Catch a Predator deals?
Who we preyin' on?
We're the fuckin' minors here.
She's the one who says she's 38.
Jesus. It's gonna be like fucking my mom.
I ain't sure it ain't your mom, motherfucker.
- Fuck you.
- I don't think I should go, man.
I'm having some doubts over here.
Oh, you're going.
You don't think the three of us balling this woman in the same room... is a little faggoty?
Jesus Christ, man.
Don't be so fuckin' middle-class.
I'm gonna take the car out, all right?
No, no, no. Hey, we're gonna be on TV in a minute. Watch.
This was the scene this morning outside the funeral of Jacob Harlow...
the 19-year-old whose body was found last week...
in a Dumpster behind a well-known gay bar on Slattery Drive...
bound head-to-toe in plastic wrap.
Harlow is the latest victim in a rash of hate crimes...
that have rocked the city this year.
Pastor Abin Cooper and the members of his Five Points Trinity Church...
staged their 432nd funeral demonstration since 2001.
- This is Catherine Carlyle...
- Oh, oh, oh! There we are.
There we are.
- I'm sleeping with a TV star tonight.
- Yeah, you are.
How'd you know we were gonna be on there?
Barbara called me.
She saw it on the 5:00 news.
So you gonna tell your friends we're famous?
- Probably not.
- Smart ass.
Where you off to tonight?
I don't know. Just gonna drive around with Jarod and Billy-Ray.
Probably go see a movie or something.
Fill up the tank before you bring it back.
- Can I get some money for gas?
- No.
Later.
So how are we gonna do this?
How do you mean?
Talkin' about how are you gonna get under us.
- What are you talking about?
- Me and the lady.
You fuckin'...
This is what happens when fuckin' parents block porn sites, man.
They make socially backwards kids.
How about you just pull over and let me out.
Come on, man. You're being...
Oh, fuck!
- You hit it.
- Fuck.
You fuckin' hit it.
Why the fuck are we gettin' out?
It's so fuckin' dark out no one could see us if they were looking.
Holy shit! Look at your fuckin' car.
Your fuckin' car!
- Are you kidding me?
- Holy shit, man.
Dude, that's, like, a lot of... damage.
That sucks, man.
Who the fuck parks their car on the side of the road like that?
You think there's somebody in there?
I don't know, man. Nobody's here.
Why the fuck did you stop?
Oh, fuck. You got 'em real good.
- Holy fuck!
- Fuck!
- Fuck!
- Get in the car! Get in the car!
They ain't following us.
Why in the fuck was that guy on the side of the road?
Who cares, man?
Let's just keep fuckin' going.
- My car's fucked up, man!
- Well, guess what.
Your car's gonna be fucked up when you get home too.
So why don't we just keep going?
We're in Cooper's Dell already.
We'll hate ourselves tomorrow if we don't do this.
- I'm not gonna hate myself.
- I'm gonna hate not getting that pussy... so let's not take this little fender-bender as a bad omen, boys.
Let's fucking do this!
Lasso me some pussy!
She lives in a trailer?
You live in a trailer, motherfucker.
I was just askin'. Damn.
You Jarod?
This here is Travis, and that's Billy-Ray.
I bet you boys wanna get up to the devil's business, don't you?
Well, devil's right in here.
You look lovely.
How 'bout a beer, boys?
Hey, Pete. Can you believe it?
I got sideswiped tonight.
- You get 'em?
- No.
I was parked and they kept movin'.
Why were you parked?
Oh, I was makin' a reservation for Helen, tomorrow night for our 19th.
I'm thinking about taking Darla someplace special... for our fifth next month.
Someplace overseas, you know?
Like maybe Italy.
Soon as I win enough off these doggies.
Well, win enough to do this damn body work on my car, would ya?
Dumb-ass kids.
How you know they was kids?
I don't know.
They was in some kind of Mom-mobile.
Suppose that's mighty keen detecting skills there, Sheriff.
Yeah, well...
I'm gonna need you to go out there and find 'em.
You kiddin' me?
I'm off the clock 10 minutes now.
The only reason I'm still here is 'cause you're so damn late.
Jesus Christ. Just go out and find the damn car, will ya?
It's a blue Volvo station wagon.
Geez.
This is nice.
You boys finished your beers yet?
- I'm workin' on it.
- Almost. Almost.
Takes me a few beers to work up to the sex.
So get drinkin',
'cause I ain't drinkin' alone.
And I don't let no man in me unless he's got at least two beers in him.
Thank you, ma'am.
Makes sense.
This is nice.
Will you close your fuckin' legs?
It's like a shag.
So how's about you head back into the bedroom... start strippin' down so we can get this thing started.
Yes, ma'am.
Almost don't even fit in here.
Get them beers drunk.
This bitch wants my dick, don't she?
She is a lot better looking.
Them tits ain't nothin' to write home about.
Those tits are...
Fuck!
What the fuck?
Fuckin' roofies.
Hello?
Guys?
Is that you, Travis? Billy-Ray?
On a hill far away
All right, guys, come on.
Seriously, let me outta here.
Can you just let me outta here, please?
The emblem of suffering...
Guys, this isn't fuckin' funny, all right?
Will you let me outta here, please!
What the fuck is going on?
Let me the fuck outta here, please, all right?
This isn't funny anymore.
This isn't fuckin' funny anymore.
This isn't funny anymore, man.
Come on, let me the fuck out!
I swear to God,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!
Let me out!
If you guys don't let me the fuck outta here, I'm gonna kill you!
I will cherish
The old rugged cross
Will you find somebody to...
Can somebody please let me outta here?
Please?
- Lucas, sit down.
- Fuckin' bitch.
Hey, you fuckin' bitch!
Let me the fuck outta here, you fuckin' bitch!
The old rugged cross
Fuck!
And exchange it someday
For a crown
Well, how about that?
That was lovely.
Just lovely.
Y'all give that Mormon Tabernacle Choir a run for their money.
You know what this is?
That's a printout of what we done today.
That's an article that appears in tomorrow's Post.
You know what that's called?
National coverage.
- Sure was.
- Indeed, it was.
Abigail...
TiVo'd the segment on the 5:00 news.
Y'all can watch it later if you want to... and see yourselves on the TV.
Yeah, tell you what we gonna do next week.
We gonna paint the garage.
I know how you love that, but we gonna paint.
Someone, please!
Come on, please!
I need big, strong volunteers.
How about you?
How about you? You big and strong?
RJ?
Show me how Popeye do.
Popeye!
Yeah, oh, wow! Don't hurt me, Popeye.
Oh, Popeye, don't hurt me.
Will somebody please let me the fuck outta here!
Caleb, come on, now.
That's a bit much. Now, come on, come on.
No! Fuck! Fuck!
- Welcome, family.
- Good evenin'.
- Good evenin', Granddaddy.
- Good evenin', Grandpa.
Good evening.
But what's so good about it?
Psalms 117, verse 24.
"This is the day which the Lord hath made.
We will rejoice and be glad in it."
Glad in it.
"Oh, woe is me if I preach not the gospels."
Corinthians 9:16.
Amen, Grandpa.
Oh, well, I think
I'm gonna preach that holy word.
- Preach it, Daddy.
- Yes.
We read in Hebrews 11...
By faith... by faith...
Noah, being warned by God of things not seen as yet... prepared an ark... for the savin' of his house... by which he condemned all others.
For there was multitudes upon multitudes of people... and God drowned them all except Noah and his flock.
Drowned them all.
All sinners gone to hell.
Praise his name.
I'm good at climbing.
I'm good at climbing.
You talk to some of them maudlin, touchy-feely preachers out there... peddlin' their soft faith... they gonna tell you what you wanna hear.
They ain't gonna tell you what you need to know.
They can't. Can't tell you the truth.
Why, it might be politically incorrect.
But they'll tell you... this nation and the world is goin' to hell.
They won't tell you why.
Can't tell you why.
They'll tell you...
"God loves you.
God loves everybody."
Does a God that drowned the entire world, exception of Noah and his flock... sound like a God that loves you?
No.
That sound like a God that forgives your sins?
- No!
- No, sir.
Your carnal desires?
That's not God's love.
That's a God that abhors the wicked.
He abhors those that ignore his righteous teaching... and forsake his covenant... and scoff at his acts.
God doesn't love you... unless you fear him.
We talk about a fear we have of certain snakes.
Well, that'd be a righteous fear.
We talkin' about a fear we have of takin' a cookie...
Grandma's cookie jar...
'fraid of being caught?
I don't believe so.
Talkin' about the fear of God. I fear God.
You better believe I fear God.
But my fear is born out of respect...
- Oh, fuck.
- Admiration... devotion... sacrifice... adoration... and knowledge of the scripture... that I preach.
Give us some knowledge, Daddy.
Give us some knowledge.
But I preach knowledge, and I preach to this... and I preach, and I preach...
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord.
I preach like my daddy before me, and his daddy before him.
My grandaddy built this church goin' on a hundred years ago.
He used to minister up there... at the 12th St. Baptist up there in the city... till he couldn't stomach what he called the deviltry anymore.
So he abandoned that modern-day Gomorrah and settled Cooper's Dell...
June, 1917.
But if he thought people were depraved back then...
I mean, his head'd nearly burst... if he saw how wicked this country's become.
I hate the wickedness of America... and all the sin-worshippers who populate it.
"Do I not hate them, O Lord, that hate thee?"
Says in Psalms 138...
"Am I not grieved by those that rise up against thee?
I hate them with a perfect hatred.
I count them mine enemies."
Twenty-one, 22.
And who's the greatest enemy of God, Cheyenne?
- Satan.
- Satan.
- That's right, baby.
- Satan.
Yes, ma'am.
And who's Satan's instrument on earth, Fiona May?
The homosexuals.
That's right, baby. The homosexuals.
The homosexuals have run amok in this nation over 30 years now.
Let's see what it's brought us.
Rampant fornication... adultery... abortion... flagrant sexuality... in every corner of media... movies, TV, et cetera.
Schools, malls, books... clothes, toys, music...
Everywhere.
Everywhere!
You can't turn on the TV without seeing some jackass wavin' his privates.
That's because the moral spine of this country has been weakened... by permissive attitudes... and an unabashed tolerance for homosexuals.
Godlessness.
Godlessness.
The casual acceptance of the gay... has hastened our demise as a species.
Fact. Why? Because they do not procreate.
They do not procreate.
Now, they solicit. Yeah, boy.
They recruit.
Yeah, boy.
But they do not procreate.
Is there anyone... anyone... who can look at the news... and deny these are our end times?
Outside our fence lays a world at waste.
They's famine, such as in Africa... pestilence, such as the gay AIDS.
Monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes and the ensuing floods, such as New Orleans...
New Orleans is number one sin city.
Thailand... Thailand!
Thailand... where pederasts travel thousands of miles... spend untold amounts of money... to sodomize a child.
A baby.
Thousands upon thousands dead in that tsunami.
I never saw the hand of God so clearly in all my born days.
And the Lord's bore witness to this apostasy.
Apostasy... The leaving of faith, the denying of religion... denying of morality.
He's done with it.
He's done with it.
The end is nigh.
- The end is nigh.
- Yes, it is.
Cheyenne, bunny rabbit... do you mind taking the children out now for the lesson...
'cause it's gonna get grown up in here.
You ready?
Come on, babies. Grandpa loves you.
Come on.
Gimme your hand there. Come on.
Come here. Come on, sweetie.
When you get finished today in school...
I want you to tell me all about it, will ya?
Will you tell me about it later?
I wish you'd talk to me sometime.
Would y'all like to see who we have to thank... for the extinction of the human race?
It.
Y'all know about that Worldwide Web.
Yeah, that's the devil's playground.
We harnessed the devils' technology... went out like sheep amongst wolves... into them homosexually oriented chat rooms... and we promised them boys what they wanted to hear.
Just like an insect... just like moths to a flame, like flies to horseshit.
Insects. Insects... that are easily trapped in that snare of God... on that there Web.
And we gonna deal with 'em the way God taught us to deal with 'em... the way we dealt with little Jacob Harlow... who burns in hell as we speak.
Now... there's a commandment talks against killin', isn't it?
There's a commandment speaks against killin'.
God's talking about your fellow man.
He's not talking about this... insect.
I mean, you don't mourn the death of a germ when it's been cured.
And a homosexual... won't stop sinnin' of its own volition... and it's up to the righteous to curb the spread of its disease.
"If a man also lie with mankind... as he lies with a woman... they both have committed an abomination... and they shall surely be put to death."
- That is the scripture.
- No. No!
That is scripture.
Well, the wrath of God... is revealed from heaven...
against all ungodliness.
No! Please, help!
Help!
Now tape him up good, boys.
Now you watch that gay saliva.
If it gets on ya, it can turn ya.
Don't get it near his orifices, now.
- Shut up!
- Send the sinner straight to hell.
Come on, baby.
Send the sinner straight to hell.
Shut your mouth!
Send him off wrapped like a package.
Come on, Caleb.
Burn in hell, cocksucker.
No!
Caleb, head hole.
Let us out of here!
We didn't do anything!
Let us the fuck out of here!
Oh, man!
Let us out! Let us out of here, please!
All right. Get that other one.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, God. I ain't gay! Please!
Don't! No! No!
No, look, I ain't even gay!
Please, no! No!
Please! I ain't even gay!
I ain't even gay. I ain't even gay!
Please!
Stop. I ain't even gay! Please!
Let me go! Please!
- Jarod!
- Travis! Billy-Ray!
What the fuck are you doing? God!
- Take it easy, kid.
- I ain't even gay! I ain't even gay!
You might be worse.
Came to these woods to share a woman with other men in the same bed.
Will somebody please fuckin' help me!
Fornicatin' ways, they caused the destruction of both Sodom and Gomorrah.
I don't wanna die!
You already did, sinner.
You destroyed your spirit... in a waste of shame.
Hey, Billy-Ray.
Fuck.
Hey, Billy-Ray.
They gonna do us like they did that guy.
Not if we can get outta here first, man.
- They gonna kill us!
- Listen. Listen to me.
I think a bone snapped out of this dead guy's skin when they dropped him... because I feel something stabbing my leg.
What the fuck, man? What the fuck?
I think I can fuckin' tear through this paper... if you can just fuckin' lean back a little bit.
Just work with me here a little bit.
Just tell me what I gotta do.
Lean back a little bit so I can lean forward. Just work with me.
Oh, no. No.
Really, no. Fuckin' lean into me, man.
Do you wanna fuckin' die?
Do you wanna fuckin' die?
Then fuckin' listen to me and we'll go home, all right?
Stop being a fuckin' baby and let's fucking get outta here, man.
Just lean back a little bit.
All right?
Just relax and lean back just a little bit so I can lean forward.
If I can get the bone on the thing...
Just can't see straight.
Hurry, Trav.
It's only tape, man.
I just want my mom.
I really want my mom.
Oh, you can't do it.
Electronic gate.
It's got one of them magnetic locks on it.
- That's why I couldn't...
- Yeah.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Pastor.
That's all right.
You're a man of the law.
What can I do for you, Officer?
I'm following up on a report of a traffic accident.
Station wagon sideswiped a car out on Route 9.
Oh, my Lord. Anybody hurt?
No, sir. There was no one in the car at the time... but I see you got a wagon over there with some damage... that matches the description.
Fuck!
Oh, fuck. I'm free. I'm free.
I'm free.
- I tell 'em and I tell 'em and I tell 'em.
- Sir?
That's my granddaughters'.
Once in a while they go into town, you know, get some milk, fetch a paper.
Whatever. I believe they're your culprits.
You know, it's not politically correct to say... but women and cars...
Not a good mix.
- Hurry! Hurry, hurry!
- Oh, fuck!
Go.
Go, man! Hurry!
It's too fuckin' tight, Trav.
I can't fuckin' do it. It's too tight.
Billy-Ray! Where are you goin'?
Billy-Ray, don't fuckin' go.
Where the fuck are you goin'?
I can't fuckin' do it!
I'm sorry!
Fuck! Fuck!
If I could, I'd like to keep them insurance devils out of it.
You know, rates are high as it is... and I'm not exactly
Mr. Popularity around here.
Well, no, I guess not.
So if you can put me in touch with whoever it is, you know... that owns the car that they scraped up... why I can talk to 'em personal.
Maybe get him some financial restitution.
Make up for it, you know.
I mean, if you could.
I mean, there's only cosmetic damage, you know. Nobody was hurt.
I guess that'd be fine.
I'll just phone it in to y'all in the morning.
I thank you so much for that.
I'm much obliged.
- Hey, you have a good night.
- You too.
Oh, fuck!
Pastor, excuse me.
Sorry. I got one last thing.
I remember you went over to the Vatican to protest that dead pope's funeral... a few years back.
And I guess what I'm saying is... is Italy nice?
Oh, my God.
- Italy?
- Yeah.
I was thinking about taking my wife someplace exotic for our five-year... and, well, Italy was at the top of the list.
Well, it's full of Italians.
There is that.
Full of Italians, huh?
Yeah, I suppose that stands to reason.
- All right, you have a good night.
- Thank you.
Oh, fuck.
Let's fuckin' do this!
Motherfucker.
Sheriff, I got shots fired inside of Five Points. Repeat. I have...
Shots fired.
Repeat, shots fired inside of Five Points.
Wait a minute. In Cooper's church?
Immediate backup requested.
- Repeat, immediate backup requested.
- I got him, Daddy.
Jesus.
Pete!
Was that a gunshot, Pete?
Pete, you still there?
Pete!
Is this that obese queer, likes to sodomize wetbacks out on Route 9?
Who is this? Where's my deputy?
Yeah, God sees all, Mr. Queer.
God takes pictures too...
unseemly photographs of men on men...
backwards, sweaty, lust-filled carnal knowledge.
That fun for you, Mr. Queer... have a man in your mouth not a mile from my house of worship?
Now, there was some unpleasantness out here tonight.
You just let us clean it up...
and I won't send any pictures of you to the missus...
or the Courier... those images of how you like to use that mouth.
And I don't means stuffin' it with Moon Pies and Coca-Cola.
I tell you what.
What about that picture of you wiping the feces of that wetback...
off of your scrotum and genitalia?
I think the missus would like that one.
She'd put it on the mantel at Christmastime... right between them two stockings.
Yeah, you keep your queerhole shut,
Sheriff...
everything gonna be just fine.
What happened in there?
Them kids was cuttin' themselves loose downstairs.
Caleb went to deal with it.
Shootin' 'em up while I'm out there with this law dog.
You want me to move his car on the property?
No.
Take him on across town.
Other side of the tracks, dump him off there.
Them Feds get rather investigative when it comes to killin' one of their own.
Hello?
This is Keenan.
I'm sorry. Who now?
Yes, sir.
That case is under preliminary investigation.
Report was members of the church were seeking semiautomatic firearms... mid-2004, before AWB expired.
We have unconfirmed reports they got a few.
Well, the intelligence suggests that they were modifying the weapons.
At least that was the testimony of the guy who sold 'em some shotguns.
He said they made inquiries about modifications.
No, sir. Undercover infiltration was unsuccessful.
Can you...
I'm sorry. Sir?
Can I call you back?
Yes, sir. Thank you.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Oh, shit.
If you loved me, you'd make me some coffee.
Caleb?
Darlin'?
Oh, no!
No, Caleb!
Come on, baby doll. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
I know. I know, baby. I know.
Timothy 4, baby doll.
Timothy 4.
Timothy 4, baby. Timothy 4.
"I am now ready to be offered.
The time for my departure is at hand.
I have fought a good fight.
I have fought a good fight.
I have finished my course.
I have kept the faith."
He's on the lovin' breast of Jesus, baby.
He's gone to Jesus.
I know, baby. I know. I know.
Come on.
Let me show you something, sweetie.
Let me show you something. Come on.
I want you to see something with me now.
- Lookee here.
- What?
Lookee here.
Caleb did not die in vain.
He sent them two devils to hell before they killed him.
Probably saved us all with his last dyin' breath.
You go rot in hell, you filthy, filthy...
Come on. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on. We got one upstairs.
Save it for him.
- Save it for him. Am I right?
- Oh, Daddy, you're always right.
There's a land
Beyond the river
That they call
The sweet forever
And you only reach that shore
By fate's decree
By and by we'll cross the portal
Where we'll dwell with thee, immortal
When they ring those golden bells
They're a pretty tight-knit group.
Approximately 20, 25 members... all related by blood or marriage.
Makes it impossible to get any coverts inside.
No, sir.
You're thinking of Fred Phelps and his family up in Kansas.
"God hates fags."
They're irritating, but they're not gun nuts like the Coopers.
They're suers, not doers.
Last April someone at Five Points... reported an I ED setup on church property.
No injuries sustained and minimal damage done to a tree... but in an interview with the local media...
Cooper claimed that if a bomb had gone off in a synagogue, a black church... or a homo-friendly Unitarian coven... there'd have been an uproar.
No suspects, no arrests.
Local law enforcement chalked it up to townie kids... having fun at the church's expense.
But it spooked the Coopers into tearing down all the barns on their property... turning 'em into barricade fences.
Locals call it "the great wall of bullshit."
Yes, sir, after the one in China.
What made 'em persons of interest...
was an interview Cooper gave to the Patriot Times right about then.
He said that
"If the law won't protect us... from the Philistines and sodomites... we'll protect ourselves."
You couple that comment with the allegations, and you can see why...
We've had 'em on surveillance off and on.
They're pretty easy to keep track of.
When they're not protesting gay bars or chasing headlines... they mostly stick to their compound... hold their daily services.
I know I'm low man on the totem pole... but are you sure that's wise at this juncture, sir?
Why? Because if you give us a few more days...
I'm sure we can dig up something more substantial than the sheriff's...
That's how you wanna play it.
No, sir, I'm not questioning your call at all, sir.
I'm saying that our history with situations like this hasn't been exactly...
Yes, sir. It's dawn here now... but we can be fully mobilized and on site in an hour.
I understand.
Fuck!
Tempted and tried
We're oft made to wonder
Why it should be
All the day long
While there are others
Living about us
Never molested
Doing wrong
When death has come
And taken our loved one
It makes our hearts
So weary and drear
Then do we wonder
Why others prosper
Living so wicked
Year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother
Live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Come, sweetie. Come. Come.
Farther along
We'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
All by and by
Fuck!
Fast little monkey!
Who fired? Who fired, goddamn it!
Local Agent 3.
Goddamn it!
- What are you...
- Who the fuck are you?
Did he fire at us?
- No, he was armed.
- Did he open fire at us?
- Son of a bitch had a machine gun!
- They got kids in there, asshole!
- Sorry! I'm sorry.
- Kids you just turned into hostages!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Asshole!
You can't talk to me, you son of a bitch.
I am a King's County elected official!
Sit your ass back in your vehicle!
Now!
How much you think a cross like that costs?
You mean in dollars or common sense?
Zing!
We get the spike mic set up?
Well, we were about to, and then Barney Fife happened.
Well...
Let's go old-school.
We get any blueprints or whatnot?
- It's all county had.
They haven't built an addition to the original structure for the last 50 years. No permits.
They got anything on four legs except horses we gotta look out for?
Isn't this a stable?
No, that's Home Depot.
It was a stud farm. Belonged to the last neighbors the Coopers ever had... before Abin drove 'em off and bought the land.
That's where they load up with all the lumber so they can build this elegant fucking fence.
Million-dollar views from three directions and then, bam! "Casa de Bat Shit."
Do you know how you get a valley this beautiful all to yourself?
Put a giant fucking cross on your front lawn.
Give me the horn.
This is Special Agent
Joseph Keenan of the ATF.
We're here to execute a search warrant on the premises... on suspicion of violation of the National Firearms Act.
Put down any weapons, come out with your hands up, and you will not be harmed.
Repeat: You will not be harmed.
I think it's the use of the word "repeat" that makes this work every time.
You wanna breach?
No.
Give 'em a minute.
Get a line opened up.
Yeah, that's gonna...
Come on!
Goddamn it!
Get down! Agent, get down!
Right now!
This is Special Agent Keenan, sir.
Cooper's Dell has escalated into a firefight.
Requesting backup.
Get the fuck outta here. Go grab a rifle.
The local sheriff shot and killed an armed assailant.
We C-C'd. They opened fire.
They shot Brooks.
The fucking church people!
They're heavy with AK's and TECs.
I need backup now!
You said this was gonna be a simple in-and-out, sir.
Simple just shit itself.
Media, sir?
The closest TV station's a hundred miles away.
The local paper prints once a week.
Media's not a factor, sir.
Sir, that sounds like...
With all due respect, sir... maybe we should get the deputy assistant director on this call.
Jesus Christ, there's kids in there, sir!
Just give me another 10 minutes.
I can open up a line...
I'm gonna want something in writing to protect myself and my field office.
No, I'm gonna need something more substantial than your word for this.
Either I get a text, or an e-mail, or something official...
I can stand behind or it's no-go.
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!
Down! Who else is coming out that door, huh?
- It's just me.
- Bullshit!
There's kids in there and I wanna get 'em out.
Is that Group 2?
Are they sending us more agents?
The situation's been reclassified.
We're to take down this domestic terrorist cell.
- We fired on them first, Joe.
- We didn't.
That fat fucking asshole local.
What are the orders?
Hold on a second. We don't even know what the goddamn situation is in there.
Our intel is limited. We've had no fucking communication with them!
"Our investigation of the Five Point Church... at Cooper's Dell has uncovered an extremely hostile... domestic terrorist cell, heavily armed... with intentions of bombing a local shopping mall this morning."
You're fucking kidding me!
"When we came with arrest warrants, they opened fire on us... killing the assistant special agent in charge... leaving us no choice but to take the premises with deadly force."
Jesus Christ.
There are women, and there are kids inside there, man.
"In the resulting firefight, all suspects were killed."
Give 'em the gas, then dynamic entry.
Joe, the suits ain't here.
We're here, Joe.
You're here. You can call this.
And then what, Harry?
The FBI takes over, and we look like assholes... who can't do our jobs... again.
That's what happens the minute a single news van rolls up... and any one of these people walks out of there alive... goes on CNN and says we're the bad guys.
Doesn't matter who the fuck's around to tell it to the goddamn news.
That's exactly what we're gonna be... the fucking bad guys!
I got 18 years in.
I'm not telling my wife she's gotta clip coupons till we're dead...
'cause I couldn't follow a simple order, shitty as that order is.
And we're not talking about Gandhi here.
I got a piece of Brooks's skull in my fucking knee.
They're shooting at us with military ordnance.
These ain't a bunch of tweakers in a motel meth lab.
They are big bad eggs.
Get your men ready for a breach.
Sir, I've apprehended one of the suspects.
Unarmed girl, early 20s.
She's says she's the caretaker of the kids in the house.
She says she wants to get the kids out the back without her people knowing.
I think she's legit, sir.
Requesting instructions. Over.
This is a hostile domestic terrorist cell.
Use of deadly force is permitted.
- She's not even armed. Over.
- We're not terrorists.
Those are your goddamn orders.
It's the wrong move, Joe.
We're not terrorists.
We're not. You can't do this. Please.
- No! We're not terrorists!
- Stay back! Stay back!
Please, don't! Please! Oh, God.
You need to take this gun and go back to the house, ma'am.
- Run back to the house.
- I don't want it.
Take the gun and head back into the house!
No! You're gonna shoot me!
Take the fucking gun, bitch, and go to the house!
No! Oh, God!
Get in there!
Your daddy's dead.
This is how you respect his memory?
By trying to run out on your family?
No. Mama, they think we're terrorists.
They're gonna kill us all.
Good.
Then I'll be in heaven with Caleb.
Isn't that what you want?
To be with your daddy and Jesus?
But, Mama, what about
Melanie and the babies?
Me and the babies, Mama.
"How sharper than a serpent's tooth to have a thankless child"!
You get down on your knees and pray for God's forgiveness!
When you get done with that... you take this, come join your family up front.
Come on, come on.
- Like a good Christian.
- Yeah.
They're trying to kill the children, Daddy.
They're trying to kill us all, baby.
I don't wanna live in this world no more.
I wanna go to Jesus.
Well, baby... if you die... fighting an army of sodomite-protecting idolaters...
I suspect the good Lord's gonna give you a mansion in his kingdom.
You always know what to say to make me feel better, Daddy.
"Now learn ye the parable of a fig tree."
Yes.
Such as Matthew 24.
"When his branch is yet tender... and putteth forth leaves... know that summer is nigh."
Well, baby... looks like summer's about as nigh as it ever gonna get.
Let's go.
I shall see the face of the Lord... and the Lord's glory shall surely...
You're gonna be quiet, okay?
I don't wanna shoot you, but I will.
Okay?
Okay.
Are Travis and Billy-Ray dead?
So what? You gonna fucking kill me?
If you help me, I won't.
Else I will, I swear.
There's government agents outside... and they wanna come in here and kill my family.
- Fucking good!
- Will you shut up?
I'm trying to save your life.
Those government people... they're gonna kill you too.
They already shot your friend... and they are gonna kill everyone in this house...
'cause they screwed up what they came here to do.
They're gonna kill us so that we can't tell on 'em.
They don't want any witnesses... so they're gonna bust in here and shoot all of us... even my little brothers and my sister and my cousins.
But I can't let the babies get killed.
I've done some bad things.
But if I let them babies get killed...
They don't know what we've been up to in here.
If they did, they could just arrest us.
They could put us on trial... and then the Zionist media would make heroes out of 'em.
But they are gonna need witnesses... and that's you.
That's you.
So, if you and me... we can get out there without gettin' killed... we can tell 'em what's really goin' on in the chapel.
We do that, and they can't kill the babies.
Sara, baby.
Gimme some sweet tea, will you?
- You want me to save your life?
- No, no.
You want me to save your life?
You killed my fucking friends.
It's not me I care about so much as I care about the kids.
My cousin's kid ain't but three years old and my little sis...
My little sister's only eight.
Fuck you.
You think they're gonna believe that you weren't one of us?
They won't even give you the chance to tell 'em before they put one in your head.
'Cause once they get inside here that is exactly what they're gonna do.
You think I give a shit?
Fuck you... and your stupid family.
My two best friends are fucking dead.
So you know what?
Why don't you just go on and kill me too?
You can take that gun and just fucking kill me too.
Just put a bullet in my fucking head... because that's what I've been waiting for since you tied me to a fucking cross!
Cheyenne!
Please.
Yeah, I bet Billy-Ray said please too.
And they still killed him.
So fuck you.
And if you wanna save your precious fucking babies... why don't you suck a fucking rescue outta my dick, bitch?
What?
You get away from her, you heathen!
- Get the fuck off me!
- You!
Mama, please! Mama, stop it!
- Mama, please! Mama!
- Get off!
- You damn heathen!
- Get the fuck off me!
What are you trying to do to her?
Trying to get what you came for?
What did you do to my girl?
Mama!
What's the matter with you, girl?
What's got over you?
Will you put that gun down?
His friends killed your daddy.
If we just confess, they can't kill the babies.
No, don't go anywhere!
There's men outside and they aim to kill us.
So you take everybody up to the attic, okay?
You barricade the door. Okay?
What'd you do?
You do it!
You get 'em up there, goddamn it!
- You do it right now!
- What did you do, Cheyenne?
- Go!
- Mama!
Mommy! Mommy!
Is Mama dead?
Listen.
You go on with Maggie and the other kids upstairs now, okay?
You go up to the attic and you stay there until I come get you.
You don't open that door for nobody else but me, okay? You understand?
Okay, you go on now.
Quick, like a bunny.
Stevie, go!
Go, go, go!
Cocksuckers!
Mordechai!
Top of the crown! Top of the crown!
The Lord is our shepherd.
The Lord is my shepherd.
Team, get ready to flank!
No!
- Freeze! Drop your weapon!
- Look, don't shoot. I'm a hostage, okay?
- We need to talk to who's in charge.
- Drop the fucking gun!
You don't have to do this.
Get back.
There's enough evidence to put us all away for life.
- Don't move!
- Get back, all right?
There's babies in the attic!
No!
You all right?
What the fuck was that?
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir! He's calling us home!
Come on, come on!
Come on, children! Come on!
Everywhere, everywhere
Drop the artillery!
There be no need for that anymore.
Where's that sound coming from?
"And the four angels were loosed... which were prepared for an hour and a day... and a month and a year... to slay a third of men."
Hear ye!
His sacred call to arms!
The heavenly trumpets sound his name!
The one true God comes to rapture!
His faithful slay the wicked... and send this evil world straight to hell!
Enough! Enough, goddamn it! Enough!
Wait a minute!
Just wait a minute, everybody.
No more fire and brimstone, preacher!
What does that sound mean?
Well, boy... there ain't nothing left but fire and brimstone.
Can't you hear?
Can't you hear?
This is the Lord's day of judgment.
Four trumpet blasts.
The seals have been opened... and the horsemen dispatched.
Three more blasts... and he closes the book on this wicked, wicked world!
- Praise His name!
- Praise His name!
So come on!
Come on, G-man.
"G" for "Godless."
"G" for "government."
Come on.
Come on. Shoot me.
Shoot me, you bootlicking... flag-worshipping heathen!
Shoot me!
It only hastens my reward in eternity.
Shoot me! Shoot me!
And then what happened?
Special Agent Keenan?
Special Agent Keenan?
What happened?
I subdued the suspect... with a head butt.
- A head butt?
- Yes, sir. The suspect was standing... unnaturally close.
And then the trumpet blast sounded three more times, and a fourth and a fifth.
By then it was pretty clear the rapture wasn't going to happen.
So we rounded up the remaining Five Pointers.
On the record, Agent Keenan... this inquiry commends you for peaceably containing... a potentially explosive situation.
But, off the record... you disobeyed a direct order from a superior, Joe.
I did.
And I have no excuse that's gonna mean anything here.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, it is the finding of this inquiry... that Special Agent
Joseph Keenan be relieved... as head of Field Office 263.
He's to be placed on one-week leave without pay... after which time he'll report to the Washington office... for reassignment in the District.
I'm getting promoted?
You're still gonna kill him.
The United States government doesn't kill people, Agent Keenan... in or out of custody.
Of course we're gonna kill him, Joe.
We're gonna kill him with kindness.
- You're gonna let him go to trial?
- Oh, come on.
- What is this, September 10, 2001?
- Patriot Act, bitch.
We can plant him forever, okay?
Without a trial.
Never show him the light of day, let alone a TV camera or a microphone.
How...
What do you think we've been doing the last 10 years?
Yeah. It's terrorism, Joe. Okay?
If you kill an American because of a religious belief, you are a terrorist... and terrorists get locked the fuck up.
If it's all so easy to put these people away for life... why was I given those orders?
Truth?
- 'Cause fuck people like this.
- They're animals.
I mean, don't get me wrong. Jesus saves.
He ain't gonna save Abin Cooper from a fuck-load of prison rape.
Daily shtuppings by Coke-can cocks.
Savor that irony, Joe.
Hey, what was it?
- The trumpet blast.
- Pardon?
The trumpet blast... What was it really?
Oh, that.
Some new neighbors... these eco kids from the university with a compost collective... they got an acre off the ass end of the Five Point property, other side of the hill.
Abin's been giving 'em a bunch of guff because of the smell of the compost.
- Was it bad?
- Gets so you can taste it.
But Abin's been harassing these kids... sending some of his bigger boys over... to bitch at first... maybe break a window or two.
Then I guess they went old-school...
Lots of sugar in gas tanks, burning bags of dog shit.
- College kids.
- No, that was Cooper and his church.
The eco kids never so much as called the cops.
They...
They got creative instead.
They thought it'd be funny to take a page out of Revelations... and get Cooper and his family's hopes up with the trumpets.
So they got this big-ass, rusty old siren... from a firehouse that just got a new one.
The fire chief said they could have the damn thing as long as they carted it off.
It's big as a Mini Cooper.
So they truck this thing down to their compost collective... they put it in a barn, they hook it up to an iPod of all things... and they played these single-note trumpet blasts... that they pulled off the Internet.
And they had no idea that you were even there.
It was just dumb luck.
Oh, those eco kids with the compost collective?
Turns out it was a cover for a marijuana grow-house.
They're being booked right now.
But considering how they probably saved a bunch more lives...
Yeah, yeah. I'll write a letter.
Yeah.
Hey, Joe.
Really... why did you shine the direct?
My grandma on my mother's side... she had these two dogs, pure bloodhounds... both came up the same litter.
She kept them and gave the rest away to the neighbors.
Both known each other since they had shit in their eyes.
Neither one ever treated any better than the other one.
Gentlest dogs you'd ever care to meet.
So anyway...
Thanksgiving of my ninth year, these two old dogs are trailing me around...
'cause they know the score... I'm a animal lover who never finishes his supper.
So right before I get up from the table...
I toss these two old-timers a turkey leg... attached to a hunk of cartilage.
And it was like they'd never met.
They went at each other so ferociously... all tooth and claw and jugular...
They forgot anything they ever had in common... and scrapped like that discard decided between their standing and dying.
People just do the strangest things when they believe they're entitled.
But they do even stranger things when they just plain believe.
I see the face ofJesus
On my way tonight
He says to me
Old sinner, come on in
I see the face ofJesus
In that great white light
And my savior makes me whole again
In his shining eyes...
In his shining eyes...
I see the promise... of all forgiveness that sets you free.
I see the face ofJesus... on my way this night.
And my savior's light to comfort me
Shut the fuck up!

Camila.
Ready?
- I'm coming.
- You'll never beat me.
My God, look at this little town.
How cute is this?
Wow.
Oh, come here.
- Hola.
- Hola.
You know, we're close to that river that used to be
Argentina's main trade route into Paraguay.
Apparently it used to be a pretty happening town.
A lot of smugglers and rough types.
Really?
I like it already.
Pick one.
Uh...
-this one. Yeah.
- This one?
Thanks.
Here you go.
You can keep the change.
Thanks.
I mean, gracias.
De nada.
Go on, ask her.
- Go.
- Um...
Buenas tardes.
Um, donde está
El Hotel Rosarnaria?
Okay. Gracias.
Did you get all that?
Shut up.
Hello?

Um, me llamo es Stephanie.
Mm-hmm.

You have a reservation?
- You speak English.
- Yes.
Luca.
You stay only one night, yes?
Yes.
Actually, we leave tomorrow.
Do you know what time the bus to Posadas leaves?
At 8:00.
And it's the only one of the day.
Please tell me that's 8:00 PM.
I'm sorry.
It's 8:00 in the morning.
Figures.
- Your passport, please.
- Oh yeah.
Ellie.
"Assport"?
Ellie.
That's a good one.
You are not traveling alone, are you?
Um, well, yes and no.
We were traveling with a bike tour but we kind of went AWOL after the first day.
Yes, I see.
Well, please let me know if you need anything.
- Cool.
- Thank you.
Okay.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
One key.
Oh, gracias.
- Ah.
- Weirdo.
Cute.
Yeah, this is cute.
Hmm.
Whoa!
First shower.
Ugh, this is gross.
Ugh.
Hey, Steph.
There's no towels.
Yeah, coming.
Here are your towels.
Danke schoen.
What did you say to those guys?
Nothing, just that you're single.
Gee, thanks, El.
Okay, I like the potential.
Yeah, it's nice.
Oh, excuse me.
Two cervezas, por favor.
Gracias.
Is that Nick?
Seriously?
He's such a dick.
I know.
But maybe I should just talk to him.
No. No no no.
Don't even think-- it's so not worth it.
I know, but...
You know I'm not--
I'm not good at being alone.
I know, but I'm right here.
Okay?
- We had fun.
- Yeah, absolutely.
We're about to have more fun too.
Gracias.
Um, disculpe.
We didn't order these.
Don't be rude.
Mmm!
Whoo!
All right!
- No no.
- Yeah yeah.
- Ellie, no. Seriously, I'm done.
- Just shut up and drink.
Tomorrow's gonna suck.
Yes, but that's what Advil is for.
Come on, it's our last night.
To you and me.
Salud.
- I can't--
- That was hard.
Whoo.
What about him?
I don't know.
You think he's my type?
Totally.
He looks...
Responsible.
Should I invite him over?
I can totally invite him over.
- No. El, stop. Sit down.
- I’m gonna do that for you.
Jesus, sit down! Sit down!
He's gonna look over here, Ellie.
- Stay.
- Isn't that the point?
Oh my God.
Are you hearing this?
Do you hear this? Please don't tell me you're not hearing this.
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing us all a favor.
Oh no no, you cannot play that song.
- Ugh, Ellie.
My friend wants to know why you don't like the song.
Well, 'cause there's a fine line between irony and just plain bad.
Kind of like...
Your shirt.
All right.
No.
Nope.
Okay.
This one's for you, baby.
# I love myself #
# I want you to love me #
# When I feel down,
I want you above me #
# I search myself,
I want you to find me #
# I forget myself,
I want you to remind me #
# I don't want anybody else #
# When I think about you #
# I touch myself, ooh #
# I don't want anybody else... #
- Senor.
- # Oh no oh no #
# Oh no... #
Hey hey hey.
Take it easy.
- No problem here.
- # You're the one #
# Who makes me come running #
# You're the sun who makes me shine #
# When you're around
I'm always laughing... #
Hey, where are you going?
Um, el peepee.
# I close my eyes and see you above me #
# Think I would die if you were to ignore me... #
Girl emergency.
Sorry.
# I'd do anything for you #
# I don't want anybody else... #
# Oh, I don't want... #
You're not from around these parts, are you?
Performance anxiety?
You should stick close to your friend.
Wow.
That backfired.
# I honestly do,
I touch myself #
# I touch myself. #
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Do you want to sit?
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Let me take your picture.
- Okay.
- Did you get it?
- Mm, I got it.
Let me take one of you.
- You think so?
- Yeah, I like it.
Now you're my prisoner.
Really?
- Does that mean I'm in trouble?
- Big trouble.
What?
What does that mean?
- It means that you...
- Yeah?
- ...your friend...
- My friend?
- ...and I...
- Uh-huh.
No way, Jose.
Not with that one.
Mmm.
Ooh!
Oh my God.
You'll wake her up.
- Shh.
- Shh.
Silencio, por favor.
Let's go to my place.
Your place?
No no no. We can't.
Who says?
- Me says.
- Oh, you says?
Yeah, me...
- Come on, you're gonna love it.
- I know I'll love it.
I know.
I just can't.
My friend, she's in... she's inside.
Well, tell her to come.
Tell her to come.
I'm not gonna tell her to come.
Come on.
I live really close to here.
- I don't... we can't.
- Okay?
- I told you I can't go.
- Come on, you're coming with me.
I'm not gonna come with you.
Okay, all right.
This hurts.
Ow, stop!
What the hell?
- Hey!
- Let me go!
- Get away from me!
- Come inside!
- Hey hey!
- Steph.
Come on, we are just having--
Keep 'em closed.
He's mean. Oh!
- What? Habla la bamba?
Girls, open the goddamn door!
- Ooh.
- Jesus, you trying to get us killed?
- Ellie, come outside.
Ellie!
Hey, asshole.
Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
Sorry, girls.
Maybe next time, all right?
You too.
Hey, Steph.
You saved me.
Aw shit. Ellie, get up.
We're late.
Oh, no no no no.
Oh no.
I’m not kidding, El.
- We cannot miss that bus.
- Oh no.
Wait!
Don't leave us here!
Wait!
No!
Oh, we're screwed.
- We'll just take the next bus.
- There is no next bus.
Oh yeah.
Why did this have to happen to us on the last day?
Everything was going so great until now.
Come on, let's go back.
So that's flight 206 at 1600 hours.
Um, that's 4:00 PM, right?
Okay. No, that's fine.
Thank you.
- Thank you, bye.
Are we good?
No, Ellie, we're not good.
We're both out 200 bucks.
Oh my gosh.
Wake me up never.
Come on, let's at least do something fun.
I am doing something fun.
You have not left.
Oh no.
Actually, we missed our bus.
But we wanted to go to this place...
Villa Del Lago.
Have you heard of it?
They say the water there can cure polio.
I don't have polio.
Villa Del Lago.
No, it's a ghost town now.
There is nothing to see.
If you must go somewhere, go to see the waterfalls or to see the caves.
- They are beautiful.
- That sounds like fun.
Ellie.
All right, well, thank you.
Thank you. That's great.
Rosa.
- Permiso, chicas.
- Thanks.
- Come on.
- Huh-uh.
- Come on, Ellie, let's go.
- Huh-uh, no!
Wake up.
Dude, stop!
Oh, look at that.
Wow.
Hey, let's just lay out here.
- Ellie, really?
- Come on, just relax.
We really don't have anywhere to be.
You win.
Here, sunshine.
It will all be okay.
I promise.
Thanks, El.
- All right.
# I'm feeling blind #
# Like the sun's in my eyes #
# Since I'm fighting in a losing war #
# Tiny little fault lines cracking inside my soul... #
# I'm alive... #
You ready?
Ellie, I know you can hear me.
- Let's go.
- Huh-uh, later.
And when exactly is later?
I don't know, Steph.
When I'm ready.
Ow! What the hell?
I said I'm not ready.
Well, I am.
El, we can’t be here all day.
You really really need to learn to have some fun.
And what, you're gonna teach me, I suppose?
Yeah, actually.
I probably could.
Where would we start, huh?
The men's bathroom?
That sounds like fun.
Okay.
No, that's great.
I see where this is going.
- Forget it.
- No.
Forget it. No, you're right.
If you didn't care before attacking him in the bathroom, you're certainly not gonna care now.
Okay, Steph, I'm sorry.
If it's any consolation, he didn't take the bait.
It's still really shitty, Ellie.
- I guess you can't help it.
- What?
You know what? I probably actually should have done something.
Because God knows you never would have.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You know what?
Just-- just forget about it.
No, bullshit forget it.
Say what you mean.
I mean, Steph, God forbid you take a chance on another guy instead of dwelling on the same old one.
He said we’d work it out, El.
Stephanie, he cheated on you.
This is crazy to me that you're still defending him.
You should have dumped that guy right on the spot.
But you didn't.
And now you're hurt and I have to pick up your pieces of yet another disaster relationship.
What? Is this coming from you, the expert?
You think a relationship is when you get the guy's last name.
Wow.
You know what?
Screw you.
Nice.
Steph, wait.
Where are you going?
What do you care?
You're on vacation, Ellie.
I don't want you to have to worry about cleaning up after me.
Have fun.
Come on, El, where are you?
Oh my--
So it's me.
Um, where are you?
I'm at the cow place now.
Um, okay.
So call me.
Bye.
Hey'
- Hi.
- Where's your friend?
Coming.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Any minute now.
Oh hey, thanks for your help last night with that guy.
- He was a real creep.
- Yeah, he was.
You know what?
Probably got a flat or something.
I'd better go.
But see you around, uh...
- Michael.
- Stephanie.
Hey, where are you going?
I'll give you a lift.
No, I'm okay.
Thanks though.
Wait! No!
Somebody! No!
No!
Hey'
You follow me here?
Yeah. I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
Are you?
'Cause you don't look it.
Her bike is gone.
Well...
Well, maybe she left already.
No, there's only one road.
I mean, we would have passed each other.
Right.
I'm gonna go inside and look for her.
Are you sure this is the place?
- Yeah, I'm positive.
Do you hear that?
- It's over here somewhere.
- Ellie!
Who are you calling?
The police.
Good luck with that.
- Hola.
- Hola.
- Michael.
- Calvo.
- What did he say?
- We're gonna show him.
Here, give me the phone.
Calvo.
- What did he just ask?
- He asked...
Why were you and your friend not together?
We got separated.
Separated?
How did you get separated?
It was stupid.
We got in a fight.
Oh.
Well, I am sure she will forgive you.
Wait, where are you going?
Your friend is fine.
When she realizes she has lost her phone she will come back to find it.
Senor, please wait.
Where are you going?
Calvo.
Michael.
Do yourself a favor and find another lover.
This one has a habit of losing his girlfriends.
Hey. Hey!
I am very sorry, but I...
She was with a guy last night.
What did he look like?
He was tall.
He had brown hair.
Brown hair?
You just described half of Argentina.
- Did you get his name?
- No, I didn't.
- Could you identify him?
- Yeah.
Yeah, if I saw him again
I'm sure I could.
Well, when you do see him you can call me, but now there is nothing I can do.
Please. Please.
Okay.
You may make a report if you want.
Yeah, that... thank you.
Can I ride with you?
- Of course.
- Okay.
You want me to come with you?
No, Michael.
Thank you.
I think I can handle the situation from here.
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Just because he speaks English does not mean you should trust him.
I don't know if I trust anybody right now.
All done.
Wait, that's it?
- That's it.
- No.
We should be out there looking for her.
I mean, we can still make a search party before it gets dark.
A search party?
Where do you think you are?
This is not America.
Does it look like I can make a search party?
Then what else can we do?
Today? Nothing.
Nothing?
Please, you should not worry so much.
Your friend is just having her fun.
My friend is not out there having fun, okay?
I know her.
She wouldn't just leave me like this.
The way you left her alone in a foreign country?
I'm sorry.
I will do everything in my power.
You have my word.
This is so messed up.
Is there someone else I can talk to?
You're tired.
Why don't you go back to the hotel and take a siesta?
You want me to take a nap while my best friend is missing?
Yes.
I think you will feel much better.
It's okay.
Look, if she's not back tomorrow, we'll file a missing persons report with federal police in Buenos Aires.
Okay?
Okay.
Good.
Everything will be all right.
You'll see.
Disculpe me.
Uh...
I'm looking for my friend.
Senora.
I'm just looking for my friend.
Mi amiga. Senora?
Oh, excuse me.
Can you help me?
I'm looking for my friend.
I can't find her.
Senora?
I just want to ask...
- I just...
Senora, please.
Hey, wait.
Hey!
I just want to talk to you.
Wait.
Hey!
Ellie?
Hello?
- Michael?
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.
Look what I found.
It was in his room.
- It's Ellie's.
- Whose room?
Michael's.
Okay.
I will question him, but only if you go back to the hotel and wait for me.
You let me do my job.
Is that fair?
- Okay.
- Good.
What's wrong?
Ellie's gone.
Gone?
We got in a fight and I went on without her.
I've got to--
I've got to find her.
Come inside.
Have something to drink.
Come on. it's okay.
Come on.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Hey'
- Please don't! No!
- Just wait!
- No, let me go!
- Hey! I won't hurt you.
- Hey. Hey.
- Stop, no! Stop it!
- Get off me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
What's the matter with you?
Where did you get this?
You went through my things?
Where did you get this?
Look, it belongs to someone I know.
Bullshit!
This is Ellie's.
What did you do with her?
Look, I swear to God I've got nothing to do with your friend, okay?
You have to trust me.
Look.
Look, please.
Would you just take a look at this?
Okay?
Just take a look at it.
Her name is Camila.
She disappeared somewhere around here.
That's her bracelet.
I've been up and down these roads
100 times looking for her.
Oh God.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know, when we met she was organizing a humanitarian mission to South America.
And I wanted to be with her so I went too.
What happened?
About six months ago we came to work here.
One day she took the truck into town to get some supplies and that's the last I saw of her.
Nobody knows what happened.
And if they do, they're not saying anything.
I'd do anything to get her back.
And I'm not leaving this country until I find her.
Did you call the police?
Calvo?
Yeah, he filled out a form.
Oh no.
God.
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh God.
I can't....
Look, I've been hearing things about young women, girls, who've been abducted and taken across the river into Paraguay.
I don't know if that's what's happened to your friend.
I mean, it's rare. it's risky to kidnap an American.
But it does happen.
That's why I tried to warn her.
Oh.
I have to find her.
I have to find Ellie.
Okay.
Well, I mean, chances are she's probably still in the area.
It's too risky to move her during daylight.
But we need to find her before it gets dark.
- How?
- We need to split up.
Now I'll understand if you don't want to do that.
But we can cover more ground if you do.
No, you're right.
You're right.
Okay, I'll meet you back here in an hour.
Yeah.
Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
- Oh shit.
Michael, you're becoming a hard man to find.
Surely you must be lost.
You know me, just seeing the sights.
Yes, of course you are.
Have you seen Stephanie?
No.
Because a car has been stolen and that does not happen very often around here.
Wow.
A stolen car.
Did you find Stephanie's friend?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
So her friend is still missing and you're looking for a car?
Okay.
Come with me.
Let's take a drive.
Water.
Chucho,
I know you're not a bad guy.
I can tell by the way you kissed me.
Come here and kiss me again.
Come here.
Come here.
So you want that?
I want you.
No!
Help!
- Hey hey.
No!
Oh my God!
-Don't! No!
Bastard !
Shh.
You fucking bastard.
Help me!
Stop it!
Fuck you!
Oh God, get me out of here, please.
Well, seems that tonight is your night.
Listen.
Don't you move, okay?
Steph. Hurry hurry.
- Ellie. Ellie, are you okay?
- Steph.
- Are you okay?
- I just want to go home.
- Let's go home.
- We're gonna go home.
Shh Shh.
- Get this off me.
- Hold still.
- You can do it, right?
- Oh, he's coming!
- Shit. Come on. Come on.
- Hey!
Hey!
Let's go!
- Ellie, come on. Hurry hurry.
- Go, go.
Lock it! Lock it!
- Oh God! Oh God!
- Go, Steph, now. Come on, go.
- Oh shit.
- Get it! Get it!
- Shit.
- Come on, come on, come on!
Okay okay okay.
Open the door.
- Steph, watch out!
- Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
Shh.
- No!
Watch out!
Wait, stop!
Ellie. Ellie.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Ellie, come on.
Oh my God.
Ellie, please. Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
Hey, get off of her!
- Ellie.
Ellie, please.
Ellie.
She's dead!
She's dead!
Oh my God.
Stephanie, is this the man you say was with your friend the other night?
- Yes!
- Stephanie, get into the truck.
It's for your safety.
Trust me.
Now!
Oh my God.
She was very desirable.
What a waste.
"Assport"?
Clever.
That's a good one.
Michael! it's him, Michael!
- Michael!
- But that one will do fine in her place, don't you think?
- Michael.
- Shut up.
Get away from the car.
Where is she?
Just put the gun down.
Where's Camila?
Michael, we can still help each other.
- But you must put the gun down.
- On your knees.
Shut up!
On your knees.
Think for a second.
If you kill me then who will tell you where to find Camila?
Just put the gun down and let's talk, okay? Man to man.
I think we can work out something that will satisfy us both.
- Where is she?
- She's safe. Trust me.
- Where is she?
I swear to you no harm has come to her.
Okay.
I can bring her to you, but we must trade.
You piece of shit.
This is the only way.
Stephanie for Camila.
It's simple, Michael.
Stephanie for Camila.
No.
I'm sorry.
Michael, no!
I hope you're going to be a good girl and play nice.
'Cause if you give me any trouble,
I swear I will cut you so bad you will not even make $10 per day sucking cock in the streets.
Please.
What if I told you that you are only worth $2,000?
$6,000 if you're a virgin, but-- are you a virgin?
Get away!
Stop it!
Stop. No.
No, I don't think you're a virgin.
Please.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, you're American, not some brown peasant.
You're worth much more.
It's lucky for you my partner across the river is open-minded.
You see, he is a businessman too.
And they think you could make a nice accessory for one of his clients.
Night night.
- Get up.
I should kill you.
Then you would owe me a lot of money.
Pick her up.
- I don't like this.
- What's not to like?
- This is what we discussed.
- This is dangerous.
Girls like her-- people will look for her.
Then put her someplace no one will find her.
So easy for you.
Please.
Please.
Your greed is going to get you killed one day.
And you, you'd better be worth the trouble.
Never!
Help! Help!
Help, somebody!
Help!
Please!
Please wake up!
Please help me.
Help me, please! Help me!
Stephanie, please.
Give me the gun.
Come on.
Be a good girl.
Just give me the gun! it's okay. it's okay.

- You're texting again?
- Huh?
Come on, put that down and swim with me.
In the ocean?
There's fish out there.
- Your loss.
- (chimes)
Oh my God. Bree!
Bree! Shark!
Bree, there's a shark!
Oh my God!
Somebody help her, please!
There's a shark!
Bree, shark! Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- What just happened?
- There was a shark.
- Oh my God.
- (elevator bell dings)
- (keyboard clacking)
Welcome to Blue Water.
This better be good, Sands.
I stood up an admiral to be here.
Trust me, Commander.
You're gonna wanna see this.
What are we looking at here?
S-11's been fitted with cameras.
We received these images
10 minutes ago.
My God.
Very "National Geographic," isn't it?
- Freeze it.
- (beeps)
See?
The girl got away.
Why didn't S-11 go after her?
Because we jerked its leash.
We told it to behave.
- Come again?
- Like a shark... let me let my daughter explain.
Like a shark, S-11 can sense electrical impulses, helping it navigate.
We manipulate this ability by transmitting focused electrical charges to a series of receptors implanted in S-11's cerebral cortex.
I have no idea what she just said.
S-11 is now totally under our control.
Blue Water Corp. Has just created the Navy's next superweapon.
Sands, you crafty SOB.
You did it.
Was there any doubt?
Baby girl, bring S-11 home.
- (beeps)
- (S-11 bellows)
Sir, we've got S-11 on an intercept path of a fast moving vessel.
Change course.
No, take it in closer.
Commander, the swimmer was a chance encounter.
S-11 still needs more testing.
I procured millions of dollars of taxpayer money to develop that thing.
Before Blue Water gets one more cent,
I better see it perform.
But the external interface is a prototype.
If something were to happen...
What did you have in mind,
Commander?
S-11 was designed to go where the Navy can't, right?
Sneak into hostile waters, hunt down drug runners and pirate vessels.
So you want us to treat that craft like the enemy?
Move in tight and pursue without being seen.
- Dad?
- Make me proud, pumpkin.
I told you to stop calling me that.
Make me proud, Nicole.
- Isn't this fun?
- Yeah, man.
- (laughs)
- (shouts) Hold on!
You can breathe now.
- (thuds)
- (moans)
Whoa. What was that?
You hit something?
Whoa!
What's going on?
- S-11 isn't responding to command.
- (keyboard clacking)
The propeller must've damaged the external interface.
I told you it wasn't ready for adverse conditions.
Get the system back online now.
It's not working.
I'm engaging the kill switch.
- (high-pitched whine)
- In three... two...
- one.
- It's too late, Nicole.
Look.
- (alarm blaring)
- Woman: We've lost our signal.
- Oh my God.
- What just happened?
S-11 escaped.
So you ever see anybody fall off one of these things?
Fall? Nah.
I seen a guy jump once, though.
Wife left him so he took a nosedive from 60 floors up.
- That's horrible.
- Ain't so bad.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Feel the wind in your hair.
- (sighs)
- Splat!
It's all over with.
I can think of worse ways to go anyhow.
Like what?
Like falling face first in a French fryer.
- (mimics sizzling)
- Thanks.
I'll have that image in my head all day.
Huh?
How about getting jammed into a wood chipper?
Whoa!
Oh no!
Not like this!
- (man grunting)
- (S-11 bellows)
Signals from the tracking implant are fading, but it looks like
S-11's heading south.
Commander.
You just unleashed an eight-legged man-eating shark on the world.
A minor setback.
If you're thinking of going back into that lab and creating a new freak, forget it.
I'm cutting off all Blue Water funding until you get S-11 back.
Fail, and that's not all I'll cut off.
Relax, Commander.
We'll get S-11, even if we have to go to the ends of the earth.
Okay, telemetry shows he's heading to Mexico.
Let's get a team down there now.
Any changes?
Hard to say.
The tracking implant was damaged when S-11 ripped off its control plate.
But we're still receiving ghost signals indicating S-11's presence in the coastal waters.
Can we pinpoint its location?
Not exactly, Dr. Sands.
But S-11 is here, and for some reason, it's sticking around.
Migratory instincts.
It'll feed along the coast a few days and then move on.
- This is us, sir.
- We're here?
I chartered a smaller craft too for the recovery mission.
A fast one, I hope.
- It will do the job, sir.
- Good.
Sir, I think we should also contact Andy Flynn.
Flynn?
He's here in Mexico?
Since you let him go two years ago.
I didn't let him go, Santos.
I fired his ass
'cause he demanded a raise... a big one.
He's a greedy bastard, no doubt, but he knows these waters better than anyone.
And he knows what we're up against.
If you want S-11 back,
Andy Flynn is your best shot.
All right, find him.
Who's ready for some tequila ball?
- Ready, gringo?
- Whoo!
You missed.
Let's go, ladies.
- There you go.
- Gracias.
Andy Flynn.
Still drinking that rotgut, huh?
Santos.
What's up, brother?
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
No, you didn't.
- Blue Water wants you back.
- Not a chance, man.
Not a chance.
- If it's about the money...
- Look, it's always about the money.
All right? That idiot Sands, he won't pay me what I'm worth, so I'm retired.
- Not anymore, amigo.
- (sighs)
S-11 escaped.
Please help me!
Please! No! Please!
Please!
No, don't!
No no no no no no!
No! No!
Hey, guys.
So glad you could join us,
Mr. Flynn.
- Do we have a location?
- Sands: No.
But like an octopus, he's very territorial.
It won't stray far.
You understand you are to capture S-11, not terminate it, right?
Well, your fish might have other ideas.
S-11 can be controlled,
Mr. Flynn.
Let me show you.
We call these interface darts.
Once attached, I can access S-11's bioimplants with my computer allowing me to direct its movements.
Like a remote control toy.
Sounds easy.
It won't be easy, believe me.
First, we have to tranquilize S-11.
That'll make him docile.
And then he won't resist commands.
The tranqs will bring S-11 to the surface, and then we can hit it with the interface dart.
Why don't we just nail it underwater with your dart?
They're more accurate if shot from a grenade launcher.
And since we only have two darts, accuracy is key.
Once I establish a link,
I can then navigate S-11 to open waters.
Then our techs on the yacht will be able to fix the interface.
So what do you say?
Are you game?
Yeah.
100 grand,
200 more upon completion, why not?
You think a great deal of yourself, don't you, Flynn?
Yeah, you know what I think?
I think you're a money-grubbing Neanderthal.
And the word on you is you like cheap women and cheaper booze.
Is that right?
300 grand or I go back to the pool.
Fine, 300 grand.
But only if you bring S-11 back alive.
Otherwise you get nothing.
This is a bad idea, Sands.
We should just 86 that freak before it takes any more lives.
That freak represents a giant leap in genetic engineering.
Damage it and heads will roll,
Mr. Flynn.
Yours will be first.
Fine.
Get your stuff ready.
We're going to the boat.
Santos and I will meet you at the dock.
Donde esta senor Kingsberry?
Ay ay ay.
Classy.
You Kingsberry?
Well, the locals call me Pez.
What can I do for you, angel?
First, Pez, you can stop staring at my rack.
They're just boobs. They're not gonna get up and dance or anything.
Second... you can tell me about this.
How'd you find me?
It's what I do.
I'm Stacy Everheart, an investigative reporter with CNE.
- And this is my cameraman Bones.
- Hey, buddy.
You sent that to our station two days ago.
It was a joke.
- A joke.
- That's right.
- Oh, we like jokes.
- Sorry to waste your time.
You're lying.
A creature fitting this description was sighted just last week in California.
Now it's in Vallarta and you've seen it.
Well, I wish to the devil I hadn't.
I can't close my eyes without imagining that... that thing squirming towards me.
It's gotten so bad
I can't take my boat out.
No, I'm done with that thing.
There's nothing you can...
What do you wanna know?
All right, Pez.
Can we stop?
Come on. We gotta burn off those enchiladas from last night.
But we're on vacation, and it's Mexico.
I think it's against the law to jog in Mexico.
Fine. You're gonna have to save your breath anyway.
You'll be screaming your lungs out soon.
Wait. Why?
Two words... bungee jumping.
I found a great spot over the ocean.
So not funny.
You know I'm afraid of heights.
Gonna have to get over that sooner or later. Today's the day.
All right, tell you what.
Do this and spend the rest of the day at the spa.
Mud-baths?
Seaweed wraps?
- Sure.
- Okay, you're on.
- (laughs)
- (screaming)
All right! Yes! Great.
- Nice.
- Whoo!
Man: Yes!
Nice.
Babe, that was awesome.
I can't believe I did it.
Who's afraid of heights now, huh?
Not my girl.
- Wait, I wanna go again.
- Wild child.
Vendor:
Listo. Vamos!
Whoo!
It's gonna be like old times, Santos.
- Yep.
- It's gonna be like old times.
She's got a sexy-librarian vibe going.
- You ever notice that?
- Don't even think it, bro.
Oh, what?
I'm just gonna talk to her.
I've heard that before.
Remember Cairo?
The lady snake-charmer with cobras?
- Cairo, come on.
- My left butt cheek went black, Flynn.
- Almost fell off.
- So you miss me?
Excuse me?
You might've noticed I took a little hiatus from Blue Water.
By hiatus, you mean my father fired you.
Yeah.
I did notice, Mr. Flynn.
Look, call me Andy.
All right.
Let's just get this over with so I can get back to work.
Give me your best line.
Okay. Um, here.
- What?
- Souvenir from Baghdad... piece of shrapnel from an IED.
Went in back here, played ping-pong with my insides.
If it weren't for Santos over there,
I probably wouldn't have made it.
So I have him to blame.
Look, I remember you too,
Nicole, all right?
You spent your whole life in that lab.
First one there, last one to leave.
And I get it.
That was me once.
All right?
My whole life was work.
Thanks to this little guy, it looked like there was no tomorrow.
So that's my line.
What do you think?
Being first in the lab earned me a doctorate from MIT and made me one of the best biomechanical engineers in the country.
I care about what I do,
Mr. Flynn.
As for you, you're a mercenary.
Says it all.
Hmm. Okay.
As smooth as ever, huh?
- Oh, shut up.
- (laughs)
Okay, if that didn't get your booty shaking, have somebody check your pulse,
'cause you might be dead.
I'm Captain Jack and this is PV Pirate Radio, your spring break destination.
Just in case they're listening,
I wanted to give a special shout out to the FCC,
'cause those are the boys who kicked my ass out of America.
And, boys, you have doomed me to a life filled with sandy beautiful beaches, smoking hot senoritas and ice cold pina coladas.
- You sure taught me a lesson.
- (both laugh)
Folks, I may never leave here.
God, I hate it here.
You're kidding me, right?
I mean, this place is amazing.
Yeah, whatever.
And what is it with all this... what do you call it?
- Sunshine?
- Yes. Sunshine.
Enough with the freaking sun already.
- It's annoying.
- (phone chimes)
What do you got here?
Tell you in a sec.
You are live in five.
Four, three, two...
Hey, party people, it's Captain Jack and you are listening to PV Pirate Radio.
First mate Stephie has just handed me some breaking news.
Apparently a half shark, half octopus has been sighted off the coast two miles south of Playa Del Sol.
According to sources, it is armed and dangerous.
Yes, it's half octopus, so it would be eight-armed and dangerous, right?
Well, Stephanie apparently is hitting the tequila a little early today and she's not sharing with her captain.
- (clicks)
- I always share with you.
Yeah.
So what is this, Stephie?
Is this some mad experiment gone horribly wrong?
- Maybe they're doing a movie.
- Oh, yeah. I could see that now.
A former Navy SEAL slash oceanographer is tracking down this abomination before it takes any more lives.
I'd watch it.
Yeah, I know you would, Stephanie.
That's because you're easily amused.
I've seen you mesmerized watching a frozen burrito rotate in a microwave oven.
Let's get back to the music, shall we?
Coming up next, it's the Cheetah Whores, very hot band out of New York City.
Here is their latest hit.
It's called
"Hot Rod Hell Kitten." Meow.
- (rock music playing)
- What are you doing with this stuff?
I'm a hot rod hell kitten, get inside
I'm a hot rod hell kitten, take a ride
Itty-bitty pretty kitty
Let's go out and prowl the city
Do you wanna be my pet?
Do you wanna be my pet?
I'm a cheetah whore, can you run with that?
Yeah! Yeah!
Well, this is it.
- Nice view, huh?
- Yeah yeah, breathtaking.
- Hey!
- There.
Thank you.
- Hook me up?
- Not a chance.
Aw, you're no fun.
So what makes you think it'll come back here?
Well, when you spend your days gutting fish, you learn a thing or two about marine life.
- (spits)
- Hard to believe you're still single.
Would've thought some lucky lady would've snapped you up by now.
As I was saying, octopi are very territorial.
He'll be back.
Nicole: Santos, take it 20 miles south and stop by the rocks.
Let me see that thing.
Easy, bro.
Those spears inject enough MS-222 to put a bull shark to sleep.
But it can't bring down S-11?
Nicole: S-11's metabolism is higher than a typical shark.
Tranqs just make it more... amenable.
- Kind of like you and tequila, huh?
- (laughs)
- (sonar pinging)
- I got a signal.
- It's two miles south of here.
- Yeah, I know the place.
Resorts all over the area.
- Dad.
- Yes, Nicole.
- We got a signal.
- I don't have to tell you what's at stake here, pumpkin.
I told you to stop calling me that.
I'm counting on you, Nicole.
Bring S-11 home.
Okay, Stacy, in three, two...
Stacy Everheart here with local fisherman
Ryan Kingsberry.
It's Pez.
All right, Pez.
Can you tell us what you saw?
Well, I first saw the creature coming in from out there chasing a charter.
I thought it was a shark at first, and then I saw the tentacles and black soulless eyes like my third wife's.
Cut.
What are you doing?
Are you high or just that stupid?
Holy crap!
Hey!
Hey!
Get out of there!
Yoga instructor: Inhale.
Get out of there!
Inhale. Exhale.
Break left.
Hola, senorita.
You wanna play?
Not really.
Hey, what's the holdup?
Got it!
Mark!
- Are you getting this?
- Yes. Yes.
- (S-11 roaring)
- (screaming)
Pez:
Get out of there!
- Is it over yet?
- Um, not quite.
Pez:
Oh, this ain't happening.
That was horrible.
Sure. Sure.
Horrible.
Come on, let's go.
Damn it!
Lost the signal.
- What?
- I lost the signal. S-11's gone.
Damn it!
You sure that thing works?
I told you the tracer got damaged when S-11 escaped.
Great.
So we're chasing ghosts out here.
I don't think so.
We sure our freak did that?
The abrasions on his body are tentacle markings.
Why didn't it eat him?
Maybe he wasn't hungry.
Oh, keen insight.
I'm so glad you came along.
Tell me something,
Ms. Sands, what do you know?
I know octopi like big rocks.
- Sir.
- What is it?
There's something on TV
I think you should see.
Stacy:
My crew and I captured this footage an hour ago around Playa Del Sol...
So far only CNE is carrying this.
And that's supposed to make me feel any better?
Stacy: The creature appeared to be some hybrid of shark and octopus.
- A sharktopus, if you will.
- Hell.
Stacy:
As viewers can see, the creature is like nothing ever witnessed before, and neither is its brutality.
There's no confirmation by authorities yet, but fatalities are certain.
Dr. Sands, you've got an incoming call on satellite link.
- Stacy: It's only a matter of time...
- It's Commander Cox.
...before the sharktopus strikes again.
- All right, patch him in.
- Stacy Everheart reporting.
Wait.
First bring me a great, big, enormous scotch.
- Three and neat, sir?
- Yeah.
Got it.
What's going on?
Why did we come ashore?
To get away from your dad's
Eagle Scouts so you can tell me what the hell you're hiding.
- What are you talking about?
- S-11's killing at random. Why?
I told you,
I have no idea.
Look, even I know sharks aren't serial killers, okay?
They kill for a purpose.
And octopi?
(scoffs) Smart as hell, and not to mention stealthy.
Okay, so they're not gonna expose themselves unless they got a damn good reason not to.
Maybe our neural implants are damaging the impulse controls in S-11's brain.
Or maybe your father did something to that freak, something you don't know about.
You know, a little gene splicing behind closed doors?
No, he wouldn't do that, not without consulting me first.
My father is a man of science.
How about you tell that to the dead guy out there?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that I think your dad intended S-11 to succeed at all costs.
Blue Water didn't hire you to think.
They hired you to do a job.
And if you can't do it, we'll find someone who can.
Get Tom on the phone.
Look, I don't care if he's in a meeting.
Tell him Stacy Everheart wants to talk to him now.
- Thank you.
- (TV playing)
Yep, I'm watching the recap right now.
So what'd the network say?
Tom: The network is replacing you, Stacy.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
- That's the decision they've made.
- But it's my story.
- Hey, Stacy...
- I hope you understand, all right?
No, I understand.
- Fine.
- (beeps)
Rat bastards are sending in another reporter to take the lead.
- What?
- What is this?
Pez figured out a pattern in the attacks.
Show me.
This is where I first spotted the creature.
This was the attack on the bungee tower.
And this was the attack on the resort.
So it's sticking to the coast heading south.
- Yeah.
- What are we supposed to do?
Just head south and hope we run into it?
Worth a shot, and maybe we can get some more footage.
Then the network would have to make us the leads.
You know,
I bet we could cover a lot more miles by boat.
Fine.
But you're gonna double my salary and you're gonna pay for my car.
Oh, Pez,
I could just hug you right now.
I mean, if you were better looking and had better hygiene.
Oh, what the hell!
- Pez!
- I'm sorry.
Lock and load, boys.
It's time to get wet.
You got the helm, brother.
You better watch your back down there.
Oh, watching my back is your job.
- I don't know. Am I in your will?
- You get my dog.
You don't have a dog.
Hey. Remember, my dad doesn't want S-11 harmed, all right?
And we always do what Daddy says, don't we?
Relax,
I've got 300,000 reasons to bring that thing back in one piece.
We stick to the plan, tranq it, force it to the surface, then Santos shoots it with your remote control gizmo, and you guys jockey it back to your yacht, if your gear really works.
Yeah, it does work.
So make sure you don't miss.
I haven't yet.
Now I'm ready.
Patch him in.
Guess what I just saw on CNE.
S-11 looks impressive on TV, doesn't it, Commander?
Are you drinking?
Yes, I am. Scotch.
- Good scotch.
- Damn it, Sands.
You said you could handle this.
- Listen, if you can't handle...
- No, Commander, you listen.
The Navy said they wanted a killing machine.
That's exactly what I gave them.
And yes, the civilian deaths are a tragedy.
But greatness comes at a price.
It always has.
Just capture that freak before it shows up on TV again.
If the media links this to the Navy, we're screwed.
Don't worry, Commander.
I've got my best man on it.
Don't worry.
Flynn can take care of himself.
Worried?
Why would I be worried?
- No reason.
- Hey, do me a favor.
Stay out of my business and focus on the shooting.
- All right?
- Yes, ma'am.
What is that?
- Ink.
- Oh God, no.
- (thuds)
- (gurgling)
Santos.
It's right behind me.
It got me in the leg.
Did your tranq hit it?
No.
It pulled it out of its hide.
- What about the others?
- They're gone.
They're dead.
So what makes you think we'll spot it out here?
I don't know, but if you've got a better idea, I'm all ears.
No no, you're the captain.
Nice yacht, by the way.
Bite me.
Flynn: What do you think?
Two or three stitches?
Santos:
This is nothing.
Remember that go-go dancer in Bangkok?
Crazy chica nearly bit your pinkie toe off.
Now that was bad.
Man, I have no idea where that thing came from.
- It's like it knew we were coming.
- That's what sharks do, amigo.
No, this wasn't predatory instinct.
This was a planned attack.
- Is that mine?
- Damn it.
You better not have any diseases.
Yeah, well, it burns when I urinate.
- Shouldn't be concerned, should I?
- (cell phone rings)
- Oh, there's Daddy.
- Dad.
Yeah, it escaped and the tracer went dead again.
Is that your dad?
Tell him I miss him.
Is that Flynn?
Yeah, he's still in shock from the blood loss.
- Can he continue the mission?
- He'll be fine.
But the others, they weren't so lucky.
They knew the risks, Nicole.
Dad, S-11 is a killer, and they're random.
It's not even feeding on its victims.
Dad?
I had the tech boys make some adjustments to S-11's subroutines.
You altered my programming?
S-11 was a hunter.
We needed a killer.
So we enhanced its aggressiveness.
I designed the bioware.
I should've been consulted.
This isn't right.
It's time for you to grow up, baby girl.
Our feelings are irrelevant.
Right now all that matters is getting S-11 back.
Am I clear?
Are you with me?
- Yes.
- Good.
Now bring S-11 home, baby girl.
Did he ask about me?
- Can you move on that thing?
- Why? Wanna go dancing later?
Do you always make asinine jokes when men have died?
Look, what do you want from me?
I want you to do your damn job and capture S-11.
Okay. You heard the woman, fire it up.
- Where are we headed?
- South.
Nicole:
He's headed straight for that boat.
Flynn: I'm pulling up behind them to get their attention.
We gotta get them out of here.
Hey!
- Leave!
- Hey, this is a restricted area!
Can you hear them?
I can't hear what they're saying.
This is restricted area.
Bones, get on the clock.
Something's going on.
Please go!
They're not listening.
They'll listen to this.
- (gunfire)
- (gasps)
Keep filming.
- What are you doing?
- I didn't sign up to get shot.
That's my story you're running away from.
I'm getting the hell out of here.
Hey!
You crazy bitch!
Oh my God!
Your dad's gonna have to settle for damaged goods.
It's heading away from the rocks.
I'm gonna run that bastard down.
Santos, take the helm.
- I'm gonna take a shot at it.
- Got it.
- Santos.
- I'm on it.
Damn!
How about that one?
All right, man.
Perfect.
To the boat and back.
Loser gets the tequila.
Let's do it.
What are these morons doing?
Hey, you're a little close, huh?
- (whistles, laughs)
- What are you doing?
What is this, an amusement park to you?
- Hey!
- I'm trying to fish here.
- (laughing)
- Hey!
Hey, Maria.
I can't believe this.
What's going on, honey?
Bunch of stupid punks.
Dios mio.
Tequila's on you guys, and I'm super thirsty.
Where's Bob?
I don't know.
He was just right behind you.
Hey, something just touched my leg.
What was that?
Ed. Ed!
Ed!
Ed!
I've been horrible to you this whole time.
And you don't deserve it.
I'm sorry, Flynn.
It's Andy.
Andy, there's something
I need to tell you.
Got it.
Gracias, Miguel.
What?
Nothing.
What'd you find out?
The powerboat was rented by some Blue Water Corporation, some shady genetics engineering firm, knee-deep in defense department contracts, enough cash to go all Frankenstein and create our fish.
That's great.
What is wrong with you?
Were you a lawyer in a past life?
Or no, maybe you worked at the DMV.
Do you feel nothing, Stacy?
That guy was killed right in front of us inches away.
Inches away!
Gosh. He was kind of a nice guy, you know?
Smell a little funky, but he was okay.
Now he's dead.
And that's tragic truly.
But the story of a lifetime is right out that door.
And we can find it thanks to Pez's map.
- No no.
- Oh, come on, Bones.
He would've wanted it this way.
Don't let his death mean nothing.
You are so full of crap.
I know, but you're coming with me anyway.
Hell not!
Your father did what?
Altered S-11's neural implants, disrupting serotonin levels.
Making it more aggressive.
That explains all the random attacks.
You know what I gave up to be my dad's perfect little scientist?
Now he goes and does this behind my back.
Look, I'm sorry, Nicole.
What can I say?
He's my dad. I love him.
- (sonar pinging)
- Santos: Flynn.
It's the tracking device on my computer. S-11's near.
Do you mind telling us the plan?
We've been one step behind that freak all day.
Time to cut it off.
You aren't gonna believe this.
What?
You're finally ready to admit you're attracted to me?
Thank God.
The sexual tension was unbearable.
Ew! Gross. God.
- You?
- All right, easy.
A simple no would've sufficed.
The captain has feelings, you know?
All right, Jack, there has been another sighting of this creature.
And now supposedly CNE is running footage of it.
Really? Wow.
- How gullible do you think I am?
- Look, this isn't a joke, I swear.
Just, please, warn the audience.
- Okay, I'll warn them.
- (music turns off)
Attention all hands.
This is your captain speaking.
We're getting more reports about this half shark, half octopus creature that's terrorizing the coast, but please do not panic.
There is a way we can stop this thing.
Virgin sacrifices.
Yes, the Mexican Fish and Game Commission assures me the only way to appease this beast is to offer it a beautiful virgin, preferably 18 to 25 years old.
I repeat... sharktopus wants our virgins.
So all prospective candidates, please email your photos, preferably nudes, to Captain Jack at pvpirateradio. Com.
I wish there was another way.
I'm sorry.
This is our only hope.
Damn you, sharktopus!
Oh, what?
Don't look at me like that.
Oh!
How can you live with yourself?
- You're not punking me on this thing?
- No.
Stephie, this has to be a hoax, okay?
It's gotta be.
There's no way a shark-octopus fishy thingy really exists.
- Well, I hope you're right.
- Trust me, okay?
There is no such thing as a sharktopus.
- (thuds)
- Gotta love these Mexican roads.
Where are we?
Please, just keep your eyes on the road.
Shame on you if you kill us before sharktopus does.
Honey, why don't we go back to the resort?
Not until I hook a fish.
You still worried about that shark we saw?
It wasn't a shark.
Look, babe, relax.
It's a big ocean.
No matter what it was, we're not gonna see it again.
What are we doing here?
- We're two miles off the last signal.
- Check your map.
You'll notice the distance between
S-11's attacks are nearly equal.
How did you figure this out?
Back at Los Arcos
I wasn't sure.
And now you are?
Nope, but I'm sick and tired of chasing the freak around all day.
So if I'm right, it'll come to us.
You're in no condition for diving.
Wasn't planning on it.
We can lure S-11 to the surface without using the tranqs.
And how do we do that?
- Ugh!
- What?
You've never seen five gallons of fish guts before?
- (reel clicking)
- Whoa!
Come here.
Good!
Did you get a fish?
Come on.
Come on!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Got you.
I can't believe you bought that.
- Estupido.
- Oh, estupido? How about now?
- How about now, honey?
- No. No.
How about now, honey?
Huh? Huh? How about now?
Kevin!
Kevin, where are you?
Kevin!
Kevin!
Kevin, where are you?
Kevin! Oh my God.
- Kevin!
- (S-11 growls)
Flynn.
Over there.
Get us over there.
No, the chum's working.
S-11's coming to us.
Nicole: S-11 has gone off the grid.
The software is glitching.
Damn, lost the signal.
- No.
- Santos!
Nicole: Santos!
- Santos!
- Help me!
- Flynn: I got you, buddy.
- Santos, hold on. Don't let go.
- (S-11 growls)
- Santos: Flynn!
Nicole: Hold on!
Santos:
Flynn! Shoot it, Flynn!
- Damn you, you freak.
- Shoot it with a dart.
- Shoot it with a dart.
- I can't, it's jammed. Don't let go.
Don't let go. Don't let go.
Don't let go.
- Don't let...
- (groaning)
- No!
- Santos!
- (Santos screams)
- Flynn: No!
Santos!
No!
Andy.
It knew we were setting up an ambush.
It knew.
What are you doing?
What I should've done from the beginning.
Take the wheel.
Get that.
- (shouting)
- Right.
Where is it?
I don't know.
It was right in front of us.
Check the trace.
Whoa!
You okay?
Yeah.
Andy, look.
It's heading for the resort.
Great.
It must've damaged the propellers.
No no, damn it!
Nicole, what's happening?
S-11 just killed Santos.
It's moving ashore.
- Has it been harmed?
- What?
Has S-11 been harmed?
Listen to me, you arrogant bastard.
Santos was my best friend, all right?
Emotion is blinding, Mr. Flynn.
This is bigger than Santos.
It's bigger than you.
Yeah, I'll think about that when
I'm drowning your freak in bullets.
I have $1 million that says you won't do that.
One million to bring S-11 back to me.
What do you say?
What do you say?
- Keep your money.
- (hangs up)
Sir, we've got Commander Cox on the satellite link again.
Uh... patch him in.
What's the news, Sands?
Did you catch our fish yet?
It's my fish.
- And we're closing in on it.
- Not good enough.
You need to bag that thing now.
If you can't do it,
I'll send a team in to terminate it.
- Shut up.
- It can be there in an hour, turn that freak of yours into chowder and leave no sign it ever existed.
Shut up!
- Sands. Sands!
- Cut him off. Cut him off!
- What's going on?
- Son of a bitch.
- Find a place to dock this thing.
- Sir?
Move. Contact Briggs.
Tell him to get a car ready.
Go!
Flynn: The engine's toast.
That's all she's got left.
Come on. Come on, baby.
You can make it.
Andy, wait. Talk to me.
I am done talking.
- (dance music playing)
- Woman: Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the Puerto Vallarta Dancers.
Tell me we can find them.
Yes sir. We're tracking the GPS in your daughter's computer.
Honestly, Mr. Sands, I don't think that's gonna be enough to stop S-11.
It's not for S-11.
Which way?
- Woman: Oh my God.
- That's great.
- Is that part of the show?
- I don't know.
- Cool, Dad. Look.
- Oh my God!
- Oh man!
- (screaming)
That way.
Dude, that's awesome.
- (screaming)
- Move. Move!
- Eat this, you bastard.
- (gunfire)
You can't hide.
I'll find you.
- Damn it.
- Where does this channel lead?
Where are you going?
I might be able to head it off before it reaches the river.
Okay, if S-11 wants upriver it has to pass by here.
Check the trace.
Come on, come on.
There's no signal.
Damn it.
What about them?
Excuse me.
Excuse me, everyone.
There's a killer shark-octopus hybrid headed this way.
So please leave the marina in a timely fashion.
- What are you talking about? No.
- No?
- Okay, how about this?
- (gunfire)
- You enjoyed that way too much.
- It worked, didn't it?
Mr. Flynn!
Tell me, Mr. Flynn, when did you become such a people person?
Dad, what are you doing?
Last chance for you to reconsider my offer.
Or what?
Your boys gonna shoot me down?
What's your life compared to a miracle of science?
- Dad, don't do this.
- Baby girl, my SUV's in the parking lot.
Go wait for me there.
No.
I'm not your little girl anymore.
Andy's right.
S-11 needs to be put down.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- S-11's a crime against nature.
- We went too far.
- It can be controlled, baby.
You know that.
At what price?
How many more lives are you gonna sacrifice?
What about my life?
Oh, baby.
S-11 is my creation.
Mine.
I dedicated my entire life to it.
I will not allow anyone to destroy it.
Not even you.
- What?
- Dad, it's here.
- Come on!
- (S-11 bellows)
No. No!
- (Sands grunts)
- Dad!
Nicole:
Oh my God! No!
No, Dad! Help me!
- No! Dad!
- Nicole!
No no!
- Nicole, no.
- Help me!
- Dad, be careful. No!
- (gunshots)
Dad!
Nicole: No!
Dad!
- (gagging) Nicole.
- Dad!
- Nicole. Nicole.
- Dad.
- Kill... kill swi... kill swi...
- What?
- Dad.
- You can still...
What?
I love you, pumpkin.
No.
I'm sorry, Nicole.
I've gotta go after it.
Someone will come for you.
Andy, wait.
- This is the place.
- You said that the last three stops.
This map is useless.
We should call it quits for today.
We call it quits when I say we call it quits.
Hey, it's the guy from the speedboat.
The one following the sharktopus.
Come on.
The river narrows a few miles south, so we just need to get a pair of wheels.
All right.
I'm Stacy Everheart with CNE.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
Get out of my face, lady.
What connection do you have to the creature known as the sharktopus?
Are you employed by the Blue Water Corporation?
You got a car?
- Yeah.
- Gimme the keys.
You're going after that thing, aren't you?
Take me with you, and you can use my van.
- No.
- Then have fun walking.
Gotta love Mexican roads, huh?
What are you planning?
The river bottlenecks upstream.
I'll cut it off there.
- What about my story?
- No names, no interviews.
Then what the hell do I get?
Exclusive footage of sharktopus getting shot to hell.
Man: Hey!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Hey, guys.
Can I get you anything?
Are you finished?
Jack, be careful.
Not too close to the edge.
Whoo-hoo!
Mom! Mom!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me, please!
Somebody please help me.
Woman:
Jack! Jack!
- Jack! Oh my God!
- (clamoring)
No! Jack!
Oh my God.
Jack!
Looks like we're late to the party.
Great, I've got no bullets left and we're out of grenades.
- You could use this.
- Nicole, we're past that.
Wait. Hear me out.
S-11 has a kill switch... explosives laced into its neural implants.
But the switch became inoperable when S-11's bioware was damaged.
Then what good is it?
My dad...
I think he was trying to tell me something.
I think I can access the kill switch with my computer.
- Bones. Bones.
- What?
I think it's over there.
Come on, let's go.
But only if we establish a link with the interface dart.
We're gonna blow up
S-11's brains, but we can only establish a link if we get close enough to the interface dart and S-11.
Okay.
So in other words, what you're trying to say is that I've gotta tag that mother with an interface dart and you've gotta be close enough to blow it to hell?
Yeah, that's the plan.
Better than no plan.
Please help me find my son.
He's missing!
Calm down.
What's his name?
Mom!
- I got him. Stay here.
- He'll be fine. Just calm down, okay?
Please.
I cannot believe that you didn't get that shot.
I am sick of your attitude.
You know what?
I'm tired about you.
I'm tired about the work.
Just go on your way and I'm going on my way.
- Fine.
- Boy: Mom!
Jack. Jack, come here.
Come to me, buddy. It's okay.
Come on.
Trust me, it's okay.
Jack, come on.
Come to me. It's all right.
Give me your hand.
There you go. There you go.
Yeah, let's go, buddy.
I got you.
Yeah.
Yeah, come here.
I got you.
I got you. Let's go.
(crying) Jack!
Here. It's the last one so you better not miss.
I've been missing all day and I'm getting tired of it.
Now go over there.
It'll be safer.
No, I'm staying with you.
Nicole, go over there and get your mojo ready.
I'm gonna draw it to you.
Go!
Bones!
Bones, where the hell are you?
God.
Oh my God.
Oh God.
Oh God.
Oh my God!
Got you, you mother.
Whoa!
Nicole!
Nicole, hurry!
Nicole!
I got it.
Anytime now, Nicole.
Oh, Dad, what did you do?
I hope you choke on me, you freak.
Come on!
Oh my God.
Hold on.
Oh, Dad.
Nicole!
Okay, I got it.
Oh my God.
Nicole:
Impressive. You need help?
I'll live.
That thing better not jump out at us again.
No, that only happens in the movies.
Yeah.

Should we be doing this?
It's still a crime scene.
Sack up, Billy. It's called
"investigative journalism" for a reason.
Yeah, but don't we need a press pass or a permit or something?
Press pass this!
You know, the police missed something here, I can feel it.
What do you say, Billy? Won't a Peabody
Award look great up on your...
-Yo, Chuck, speed up, man!
-Yeah, man, speed up.
Guys, this is my dad's car.
So if I go any faster, he will kill me.
- Holy shit!
- Shit!
- Jesus, that was close.
You fucking assholes!
We are in hillbilly country now, boys.
Squeal like a pig!
Chad, just cos they're not in your fraternity doesn't mean they're freaks.
Actually, it does, Allison. You see, you're either Omega Beta or you're a freak.
- Omega Beta! Omega Beta!
- Fuck.
I'm in a oar full of morons.
No, if we were morons, we wouldn't have thought to bring this.
OK, I stand corrected.
You are a fucking genius.
Hey, Chuck, speed up, man.
They're gonna pass us.
Oh, jeez. Whoa, Jesus.
Did you see the way those guys looked at us?
Hey, guys! Guys!
We forgot the beer!
No!
Sure you got everything you need? Cos once you get up there...
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah. Where's your beer at?
Beer's in the back.
You see the way them kids looked?
- Read that list back to me.
- OK, three-quarter-inch nails, hacksaw, baling hooks, brush-clearing Scythe, clamps...
Hey, Chad, do we need more bug...
- crosscutting handsaw...
- Chad?
- Lubricated condoms...
- Chad?
Hand drill...
Feminine napkins, stone bit, one-eighth hole saw...
- Oh, my God!
- It's just me.
Let's get out of here.
This place is so creepy.
- Dale, we need anything else?
- Pickled eggs. Six-pounder.
Oh, hot dog, Tucker. Have you ever seen anything like that in your life?
There's nothing so special about them.
- They're just your average college girls.
- Nothing average about that.
You know something, Dale?
She's just human.
Why don't you go over and talk to her?
Talk to her? What?
What in the world would I say?
I don't know. Tell her that you got a vacation home. That'll probably impress her.
Are you out of your mind, Tucker?
These are college girls.
They grew up with vacation homes, and guys like me fixing their toilets.
You gotta have some faith in yourself, man.
Girls can smell fear.
Now come on!
You are a good-lookin' man... more or less.
You got a damn good heart.
Yup.
I mean, that's two things right there.
Now, go on, get over there.
What's the worst that could happen?
You know something?
- You're right, Tuck. I'm gonna do it.
- All right.
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- All right, hold up.
All right, now, whatever you say, just smile and laugh.
It shows confidence.
Smile and laugh. OK.
- Do it.
- All right.
You guys, uh...goin' campin'?
Hey! Hey. Now, look... we don't want any trouble, all right?
- So just...back off.
- Whoa!
- OK. OK. I'm sorry.
- Back off!
Get in the truck.
That's a-a good-lookin' cooler...
I told you, Tucker. I'm a zero with the ladies.
They hate my face!
Come on.
I ain't like you, Tucker, you know?
I can't talk to the lady folk the way you can.
No one can. I mean, I...
I always get all stupid, and my hands get clammy, and I just act like a big fat idiot.
You know what your problem is?
You got an inferiority complex.
No, I don't.
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.
Let me tell you something, life is short.
You got to go after what you want.
Mm-hm.
Cos it sure as hell ain't gonna just fall right in your lap.
- That's true, I reckon.
- Aw, shit.
- What are you doing?
- Shit, shit. We got a cop.
Oh, I got you.
I got a rag. Move your arm.
You spilled beer all over your crotch.
All right, he's pulling over.
- Get up, Dale.
- I can't.
- Dale, he's coming.
- No, it's stuck on my sleeve.
- Get up.
- My hand is stuck on...
Un-stuck it, then.
He's out of his car.
- He's out of his car?
- He's coming.
- Tucker!
- Get it...
Yeah.
- Howdy, Officer.
- Hey.
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.
License, please.
Uh, I lost my wallet a couple weeks back.
New one is in the mail.
Temporary.
Where you two headed?
We're headed to our vacation home up by Morris Lake.
I sank every penny I had into it.
Me and Dale here, we're gonna go fix 'er up, maybe do a little fishin'.
- Do a little fishin'.
- He's been striking out with the ladies.
I figured a little man time might do him some good.
There ain't nothing up there but pain and suffering on a scale you can't even imagine.
I pulled you over cos you got a broken turn signal.
Oh, yes, sir.
See that you, uh... get that fixed.
That was very helpful.
- Man, that was tense.
- That dude's weird.
There he goes.
Bye _
God, would you look at him?
You know what his problem is?
He was jealous because he can't afford a place of his own.
Well...
Here's to the good life, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
- To the good life, man.
I mean, what's a parasite?
Oh, look at this little truck right here!
- I know, I know.
- Is that ours?
- Wow. And another one right there.
Oh, my God.
It's perfect!
- And what did they call this, a fixer-upper?
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go check it out inside.
- Yeah.
I can't believe this is ours! Oh, my God!
- 'ell, it's just a little dusty is all.
- It's a mansion!
Whoever used to live here must have been an archaeologist or something.
Yeah, archae... Yeah.
Look at this.
Must have been a real news junkie, too.
Chubby's Chili Dog Depot?
Buy three, get two free. No expiration date.
- All right.
- Score!
Tucker, look! They got my favorite board game here, too.
You know what?
I tell you something, Dale.
I cannot believe that I am standing in my own vacation home right now.
You know something?
Dreams really do come true.
Look out!
Well , I guess we should fix that.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
You can get off me now.
If you have a reoccurring dream about sucking a dick but never do it, are you gay?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Guys!
- Are you serious?
- What?
- You guys want to hear a scary story?
- No!
- Chuck, no.
- Absolutely not.
- That's not funny.
- You're such a liar.
- It happened to my cousins, I think.
Now, do you fuckers want to hear a real story? Huh?
This story happened right here, right in these very woods.
It was 20 years ago today.
The Memorial Day Massacre.
How a bunch of college kids... just like us... they came out here to have a good time... but little did they know that they weren't the only ones in these here woods.
J` Pump it up
J` While your feet are stompin’
J` And the jam is pumpin’...
J` Pump it up a little more
J` Get the party going on the dance Hoof
J` See, cos that’s where the...
Get another one! Come on!
J` I’m gonna meet my maker
J` I ain’t afraid to die
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, put that back on.
No, no.
This is cool, I like this.
Only one person lived to tell this story.
The rest of them just disappeared... and their bodies are buried beneath us.
Hey! Hey! There's a lake back there.
Who wants to go skinny dipping?
- I do.
- Yeah.
- All right.
- I'm not getting naked.
That's OK, Tuck.
You take that. That's yours.
That's why you're never gonna get ahead in life.
It's cos you don't stick up for yourself.
Do not even think about it.
- But you just said...
- Are you kidding me?
Are you serious?
What'd I just say?
- You said I gotta stick up for myself.
- I said, "Don't even think about it", though.
That was the last thing I said.
Hello?
Is someone there?
Guys?
Yargh!
God, Chad! What the hell are you doing?
- You are such an asshole.
- Come on, that was funny.
No, it wasn't.
You got nothing to worry about, Allie.
It's just me.
You totally freaked me out.
You know, you can drop the act now.
- What act?
- Like you're better than everyone else.
- I don't think...
- Yeah, you do.
But that's OK, Allie, because I get it.
I mean, you are better than everyone else.
You and I, Allie... are cut from a different cloth.
You know what I mean?
- I'm not... I...
- All I'm saying is...
I'm glad that we have this chance to get to know each other better.
Chad, you're drunk.
That's a good thing. It lowers my inhibitions.
OK, uh...
- Come on, stop.
- Why?
Why? Why stop?
We're perfect for each other.
Let's talk about this later.
I'm gonna go catch up with everyone.
Come on, Allie. Come on...
- Oh, it's so cold!
- Here we go!
What’s that all about?
I don't know, but I think we should go check it out.
No. No, Tuck, you know what?
My guess would be that they don't really want to see us right now.
- Yeah, I kind of want to see them.
- No, no.
What the hell are you doing?
- Damn it, Dale!
- What?
I'm not gonna go around one more time with you on this.
- OK.
- Hush.
I love camping!
Look.
Oh.
- Tucker!
- Shush!
God damn it, Dale!
What the hell is the matter with you?
Me? What did I do?
When you see a college girl prancing around in front of you half-naked,
- you do not yell out my name.
- Well, you were being a Peeping Tom.
You are hopeless, do you know that? You're hopeless.
She didn't come up yet.
- Tuck, paddle.
- Oh, Jesus.
Hey! Lady?
Hey, lady!
- Where'd she go, Tuck?
- Whoa, whoa, Dale!
Help me get her in the boat! Come on!
Get her legs!
Oh! No!
- Hey, we got your friend!
- Oh, God!
They got Allison! Come on!
Hey!
We got your friend! Why the hell are they running away? Hey!
Doesn't matter, Tucker, we gotta get her back to the cabin. Come on, let's row.
- Shit!
- Oh, man.
Shit.
Chad! Chad!
The hillbillies...
- What hillbillies?
- From the store!
They captured Allison!
Allie!
Oh, God! No.
- No, please! No, please, don't...
- Don't...don't cry.
Please don't cut me open!
Oh! It's the pancakes! You hate pancakes!
I'll go make you something else. I'll just...
Doesn't like pancakes.
Should have asked her if she liked pancakes. Big fat stupid idiot!
Pa... Pancakes?
Allison!
I don't understand.
Where do you think they took her?
- Maybe they took her to the hospital.
- You don't get it, do you?
Chuck, tell him what you saw.
Well, it was really dark, but it looked like one of the guys was...
Like...eating her face off.
That is so disgusting.
Not to sound too cliché, but shouldn't we go to the police?
And just leave Allison with them?
If they already ate her, what difference does it make?
We don't need the police.
We can handle this on our own.
What if I go? It's my dad's truck. He told me
I was the only one allowed to drive it.
Fine. You wanna go, Chuck? Then just go.
OK, awesome. I'll be back in a jiffy, I swear.
That's such bullshit.
Why does he get to go?
Hey, guys!
You better come look at this.
What is this place?
It's just a cabin.
It doesn't mean they're psycho killers.
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you go in there and talk to them?
All right. Maybe I will.
I said maybe.
There you go. Please don't tell me that you hate eggs and bacon.
Wha-What am I doing here?
Oh, you don't remember?
OK. Uh...
Well, me and Tucker...
I mean, uh, I and Tuck...
Well...
- Tucker and I brung you here last night.
- Why?
Because you were about to go swimming with your friends, and you climbed up on a bunch of rocks, and you fell and banged your head and then you fell into the water, and then...
I dove in and rescued you.
- Wait, you...you were spying on us?
- No. No, what? No!
No, we weren't spying.
No, I swear to God, no, no.
We were out there fishin'. OK?
I didn't... We didn't see...
I didn't see...
Maybe Tucker might have seen a little...
Where are my friends?
- They ran off into the woods.
- They just left me?
Yeah, but don't be mad at them.
Some people just aren't any good in a crisis, and that's why Tucker and I brung you here, hoping that they would come get you in the morning.
I didn't have any girlie clothes, so...
It's OK, I...
I never really had much fashion sense, anyway.
- Me neither.
- Yeah.
That's my dog, Jangers. He looks mean, but he's just a big old marshmallow.
You can just pet him round the nose.
- He's drooling.
- I know.
Anyway, um...I'm sorry about all the mess around here.
Tucker just bought this place, and, uh...you know...
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't look like much to a high-class girl like you, but we've always just had sort of a dream to have our own vacation home.
But, uh...anyway... you should relax and rest, OK?
Hey, what's... what's your name?
Uh...
It's Tale. Ducker.
My name...
- My name is Dale.
- I'm Allison.
But my... my friends call me Allie.
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you,
Allie...son.
And if you need anything else, you just holler for me.
I'll be right in the little room here.
- Uh, Dale?
- Yeah.
Do you guys have anything to do around here?
Do you like board games?
What kind do you have?
We got this one right here.
It's my favorite. Trivi-Up.
- Yes!
- Come on, four out of seven.
No way, dude. You lost.
Just shut up and walk, bitch.
Goddamn Romeo.
Oh, well.
Oh, Jesus.
Run! Run for your lives!
Here we go. Big roll. Five.
One, two, three, four, five.
OK, shoot.
Who was the fifth President of the United States?
Oh, that's too easy. That's James Monroe.
God, you are right again. You are killing me.
I know. I'm sorry about that. I just...
I got this weird brain where I'm dumb as a stump,
- but I remember everything I ever heard.
- That sounds pretty smart to me.
No, trust me, I'm stupid.
I barely even made it past the third grade.
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
There's a difference between education and intellect.
Yeah?
So, um, what is it that you study in college?
I'm getting my Bachelor's degree in psychology.
Oh, a Bach... Oh.
So, what kind of work would you do with that?
Oh, I don't know. I, um...
I-I have these stupid dreams.
Dreams are not stupid.
Well, um...I just think that so many of the major problems and conflicts in the world are caused by a lack of communication, you know?
- Yeah.
- And I just...
I just always thought that
I'd make a really good therapist.
No, don't! Don't!
Yeah, my parents say the same thing.
I should probably just give up.
No. I think you could do whatever you want.
It's just, that beam is a little bit rickety.
Yeah, you could have just pushed that thing right over.
Hey, hey.
Oh, my God, Tucker, what happened to your face?
I sawed into a bees' nest.
Why?
I didn't do it on purpose, you idiot.
I might have avoided it if you were out there helping me!
Yeah.
We came out here to work... not sit around playing stupid board games!
It was my fault, I...
I suckered him into playing.
No, that's not true. It was my fault.
How about I come over there and pull those stingers out of your face?
Then I'll help you with whatever you want?
- All right, I'd like that. Thank you.
- OK.
Let me help.
Wow, they really did a number on you.
- Be careful. Be careful.
- They really got you.
Hi.
I saw your friend out there.
He must be allergic to bees or something, because he was runnin' like a bat outta hell.
- I should go out there and find them...
- No, no! That's... No!
No, you need to rest, so we'll go find your friends.
- But I can just...
- No. No buts, OK?
We'll go find your friends. You should relax.
Tucker and Dale are on the case.
Ain't that right, Tucker?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Good man. OK.
Dale, just... just be careful, OK?
My friends can be kind of judgmental.
I'm gonna let Tucker do most of the talking, anyway.
He can win over just about anybody, can't you? Real people person.
OK, here we go.
You just relax, OK? Get some rest.
- They fucking killed him, man.
- They left his body here as a message.
- Yeah, "Stay the fuck out of our woods."
- I can't believe this is happening.
Would you fucking quit it with this thing?
It doesn't work out here!
We gotta get to the road and try to catch a ride out of here.
We don't need a ride out of here.
Don't you get it?
This is what it's all about.
It's us against them.
Survival of the fittest!
What are you doing, man?
That's my whole face.
You have serious issues, you know that?
- Quick. Somebody's coming.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit...
And the answer was,
"isosceles triangle". You know what that is?
- Is it a triangle?
- Yeah.
Tucker, you would have been proud of me.
A smart little college girl like that, and I was beating the crap out of her.
- Dale.
- Yeah?
You beat the crap outta everybody.
There's something wrong with your brain.
I know. You keep telling me that.
Tell you what, when we get back I'll finish her off real quick then we'll get back to work.
They're gonna kill her!
- Somebody was just here.
- Oh, yeah. It's a hatchet.
College kids!
- College kids!
- Say it again. Louder.
- College kids!
- Hey, college kids!
College kids!
I don't see 'em.
They must have run off.
Well... Maybe we could leave them a note in case they come back.
All right. With what?
- Well, this'll work.
- All right. Please, hurry up.
- My face is as hot as a hemorrhoid.
- Yeah, you don't look so good. OK.
- Careful.
- I'm gonna have to etch it in.
J` Uh-huh, I got my cootie shot
J` You think that girl is hot...
- Dale?
- Yeah? Huh...
- Did you guys find my friends?
- Uh, whoa.
Whoa.
- What?
- Huh? What?
Your friends? No, no.
Uh, we left them a note.
They should be by here any minute.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm digging a shitter hole.
I'm digging a crap... crapper hole.
It's a...
It's a hole.
It's for the shithouse. Craphouse...
- Outhouse hole.
- An outhouse hole.
- Right. You mind if I help?
- What? No!
No, no, it's not work for a pretty... for a girl like you. That's...
Oh.
I grew up on a farm.
It was either help out or get out.
That's a good rule.
Yeah. So I've done this before, believe it or not.
Yeah.
You gonna help, or just stand there staring at me?
- Uh... No, I'm gonna help. I'll just...
- I can't dig this on my own.
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, you're doing a good job.
- Thank you.
That sick fuck.
He's making her dig her own grave.
We don't have much time.
- Does everybody have their weapons?
- All set, man.
All right, you guys go around, get the guy at the wood chipper. You take the big guy.
I'm gonna just chill right here.
OK, one more load and we're done.
Hey, come on, get out. Here.
Now!
Huh?
Oh, good, look, your friends are here. Hey!
Dale!
Oh, God!
Are you OK?
Allison, say something!
-Tucker! Tucker!
- Holy mother of God!
You'll never beli... What happened to you?
- Are you OK?
- What happened to me?
Some kid, he just hucked himself right into the wood chipper!
- What?
- Headfirst right into the wood chipper!
From his shoes and pants, it looked like it might have been one of the college kids.
What the hell happened to her?
She got knocked out and fell in the shitter hole right next to me.
Is that your blood?
What? No.
No, it's college kid blood. One of them suckers came running out of nowhere, speared himself through the gut and died right on top of me!
- Holy crap.
- I know!
Calm down. Don't cry.
- Calm down!
- OK.
Get a hold of yourself!
All right...
I know what this is.
- What?
- This is a suicide pact.
- It's a what?
- These kids are coming out here,
- and killing themselves all over the woods.
- My God, that makes so much sense.
Holy shit. We have got to hide all of the sharp objects!
You know what else?
I think they're trying to kill her, too.
Yeah. Think about it.
That's why they acted so funny after we saved her, because they want her dead.
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.
It's good that you and I don't know - if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.
Yeah, that's a good point.
OK, so what... what do we...
We go to the police?
- Call the police?
- Yeah.
- And tell 'em what?
- Uh...we'll tell 'em what happened.
That's a good idea, Dale.
"Oh, hidey-ho, Officer.
We've had a doozy of a day.
"There we were, minding our own business, doing some chores around the house,
"when kids started killing themselves all over my property."
Well, that's what happened, Tucker!
You would have to be a moron to believe that, Dale.
It doesn't matter what happened. What matters is what looks like what happened.
And what looks like what happened... is pretty nasty.
So what the hell do we do?
We gotta clean this mess up.
- Right now.
- OK.
You shouldn’t be smoking anyway, Chloe.
It's not good for you.
Fucking dying isn't good for you, either, but that doesn't seem to be stopping anybody!
We gotta get out of here. I mean, what the hell are we still doing here?
How are we gonna get outta here?
Dickwad over here sent Chuck off with the truck!
Well, then let's walk.
- 40 miles?
- You should have thought of that
- before you wore your stripper shoes.
- Will y'all just shut up?
Listen, we gotta work together, OK?
We never should’ve come out here.
Whose stupid idea was this?
Chad!
You guys are all a bunch of fucking pussies, you know that?
I mean, a few little tiny murders... and everyone just freaks out.
But do you know how lucky you all are, huh?
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?
How many people do you think get a chance for something like this?
- The chance to die?
- The chance to live.
To be free from people always telling you what you can and can't do.
There's no rules out here.
It's us against them.
And if you don't think you can handle that, well... maybe you deserve to die.
That's fucked up.
Y'all hear that?
Chuck got the police!
Come on, you guys, let's go!
No, you don't need the fucking cops!
The cops aren't gonna help us, man.
Don't you fucking idiots know anything?
Fuck.
Now, don't you worry.
Your friends are probably fine.
Probably just a little misunderstanding, that's all.
- Oh, God! Look out!
- Help us! Help us!
- Chloe?
They're dead!
They died!
Slow down, now.
- They killed them!
- OK.
Stay calm. Well, why don't you kids climb in the back seat, and we'll go have a look?
Those stupid fucks.
I don't think I have the stomach for this, Tuck.
I know.
He's jammed in there pretty good.
- The store better not charge me for this!
- Yup.
All right, look, I'm gonna wedge it from that side, and you pull him out on three.
- OK.
- All right?
One. Two. Three!
Argh!
- Oh, Tuck! Oh, take it off! Take it off me!
- OK, help me get it off.
Get it off me. Not on the face!
Oh! I'm gonna barf.
You're OK, you're OK.
- Here, grab a leg. Grab a leg.
- OK.
Get him over to the truck.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
- He's heavy for half a guy.
- Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
- Let me do the talking.
- That's a good idea.
You kids stay put.
I'll handle this.
- Hey.
- Hello, Officer.
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah.
- We have had a doozy of a day.
- A real doozy.
- Uh, there we were...
- Yup.
- Minding our own business...
- Yup.
- Making improvements to my house...
- The new house.
..when, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, these kids started killing themselves all over my property.
This one right here, he dove headfirst right into the wood chipper, the woody right back there.
There's another one up over there who shoved a spear through his gullet.
Straight through.
I don't know how much experience you've had with this,
- but we were scared shitless.
- Scared shitless.
You must think that I'm some kind of moron to believe a story like that.
- No...
-Oh, no.
- No, sir.
- Not a moron, just...open-minded.
Let me get this straight, cos I'm having trouble understanding something.
- What?
- You say you were just working, when this...kid...ran up and stuffed his head into that wood chipper?
- That's a fact.
- That is a fact.
And I think maybe they might be trying to kill the girl that we have inside.
- What girl?
- You know what?
She can maybe explain the whole thing if, uh... if I hadn't have knocked her unconscious with a shovel.
- That's...
- On accident.
On accident.
You've got another one inside, and you say she's unconscious?
- Yeah, she's in my bedroom.
- That's...
You better show me what you done with her.
- Right this way. Let's show him.
- OK, I'm gonna put this leg down.
Great idea. Why don't you go and show him?
Wait, where is he going?
- No, don't go in there.
- Right this way, Sheriff.
What's he doing?
Why doesn't he fucking arrest them?
Her eyes are equal, reactive to light.
- At least she's not brain-dead.
- Oh, thank God.
I told you boys to stay away from this place, but you just didn't listen, did you?
Now, you're looking at least two counts of involuntary manslaughter, but you'd be lucky to get that.
Officer, do we look like a couple of psycho killers to you?
Well, it's... it's hard to say.
Looks can be deceiving.
Oh, don't!
Sheriff! You OK?
Oh, shit!
- Come on!
- What is going on?
- How's he even walking, Tuck?
- He looks like he's gonna walk it off.
He's gonna be fine.
Don't worry, I got it.
It's Sher... Sher...
Oh, my God! They fucking killed him!
Unlock the door!
God damn it, Tucker!
I told you we should have fixed that beam!
You are not putting this on me!
Do you understand me? This is your fault.
In there playing board games with that little girl when I'm out working!
Unlock the fucking door!
If you hadn't been playing board games with that little girl inside, we would have had a little more time to fix the beam!
Heads up.
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
- No, no, no!
Oh, you got to take the safety off on the side there.
Don't do...
Jesus! Oh, God!
You've got to start being more careful!
I don't think he understands!
"You gotta take the safety off"?
You're something, Dale. None of this would have happened if it wasn't for you!
- What?
- That's right!
For being such a goddamn Good Samaritan!
"My God, she's drowning, Tucker.
- "Oh, let's save her." Hell!
- Well, at least she's still alive.
- Oh, halle-fuckin'-lujah!
- Don't you dare blame this on her!
I'm not blaming this on her,
I'm blaming this on you!
Well, you know what, Tucker?
None of this would have happened if we hadn't have gone fishin'!
- That isn't even an option.
- I don't even like fishin'!
You don't like...
- What do you mean, you don't like fishin'?
- I-I mean...
I like... I like it OK.
You know... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you kinda did.
- Cut it out!
Tucker... where's Jangers?
- Shit.
- Stay here.
Aah! Damn.
Nuts...
- Hey, hillbilly! Your move.
Oh, son of a bitch!
- They got my dog.
- Shit!
We gotta do something.
- Did you bring that nail gun in here?
- Yeah. Why?
Stay low. Stay low to the ground.
Keep your hat!
All right.
- Cover me.
- Uh...
I ain't never shot at nobody before.
If it helps, think of 'em like moving two-by-fours.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Now, you create a distraction.
I'm gonna go out the back door.
- And, Dale...
- Yeah.
Try not to shoot me.
- OK, I'll try.
- All right.
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- I don't know.
Hey, college kids! You want some of this?
Ha-ha! You like that, college kids?
How's that taste?
I got plenty more where that came from!
Bunch of freaks!
Shit!
Jesus, Dale. Take it easy.
Hey, hillbilly!
You shoot at us again, and your dog's dead!
If you kill my dog,
I swear to God, I'll get really mad!
Then bring out the girl!
I'm gonna shoot your dog!
I'm gonna get really mad!
I'll get really mad!
Go home. Go!
No, you're going the wrong way, shithead!
It is a beautiful day for a run, isn't it?
Oh, God. Please, no.
Are we done yet?
I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?
We may only get one chance at this.
All right...trap's set.
Hey...he's awake.
What the hell is wrong with you kids?
What is the matter with us?
- Hold him steady.
- Yeah.
Wait. Stop...
I've never stood so close to pure evil before.
- It kind of stinks.
- It was supposed to be 24-hour protection...
OK! Don't...
No, look, I know you kids are having fun, but I am not a thrill-seeker!
It's payback time, hillbilly.
Payback... All right, look.
Just let me go... Just let me go.
I can get my cooler.
Hey, I got 10 to 12 beers in there.
They're yours.
They're on ice right now, man!
- This is for Mike!
- No!
You prick.
- Dale?
- Allison.
How are you feelin'?
- A little fuzzy.
- Yeah.
Wha...
What happ...
- What happened?
- Oh...
Well, uh...
I can't... I can't really say.
Um...
It was so awful.
Oh, my God. I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.
- I can't cry in front of a girl, God damn it.
- That's OK.
It's good to cry sometimes.
It's OK, just...
Just let it out. It's OK, all right?
There you go. It'll feel better.
Come on, just take a deep breath.
There we go. Now...
Now tell me what happened.
Well...it's hard to say.
Um...
Your friends...
Do some of your friends take medication?
- Why?
- Because I think they forgot to take it.
What are you talking about?
What... Where are they?
They're out there somewhere right now tryin' to kill my best friend...and my dog.
- I don't understand what you're talking...
- I know.
It doesn't make any sense.
That's what the truth is.
It's like all your friends just decided to go nuts all at the same time.
The last thing I remember, I saw...
I saw Chad and... and then Todd was running at us, and...
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
At first I thought they were trying to kill you, and then they started killing themselves and then they tried to kill us, and now they're going after my dog...
..Jangers.
I guess they just like killing.
No, there must be some kind of mistake.
My friends would never hurt anyone.
Jesus, they're here!
They're not gonna stop till they kill all of us,
I'm telling you. Hide!
Dale, it's OK. Nobody wants to hurt you.
- Die, hillbilly!
- It sure sounds like someone does.
I'm gonna go talk to them, OK?
Just stay there.
- What? No, no.
- It's all just a big misunderstanding.
We’ll clear it right up, OK?
Allison, don't go out there!
You don't know what it's like out there.
Oh, my God.
Allison!
Did you see them?
- No.
- No?
That's from Tucker's shirt.
What is that?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
They cut off his bowlin' fingers!
There's a note right there.
"Now we got your friend. Try and get him!"
Dale, how... how long was I out for?
A few hours.
I don't understand what...
I gotta go help Tucker.
God damn it.
My best friend needs me.
I'm gonna get these kids.
- Wait. We don't want to escalate things.
- We don't want to escalate things?
No. They must have thought you were trying to harm me.
Oh, and why would they think that?
I... I don't know.
I think you do know.
Well, when we first saw you guys back at that store... we just thought that you looked... a little creepy.
I was nervous.
I don't know how to talk to girls, and I...
Dale, I know that now, but we didn't then.
You thought I looked like some kind of freak.
We misjudged you, Dale. I...
I'm really sorry.
Don't be sorry. It's my fault.
I should have known that if a guy like me talked to a girl like you, somebody'd end up dead.
Dale, it's... Dale, it's not like that.
If you do see your friends... tell 'em that I never wanted to hurt anybody.
Dale, Dale, stop. Wait. No...
Don't go there.
Oh, shit.
Tucker!
- Tucker, you cut there?
Tuck!
Oh, goddamn stupid college kids.
Tucker!
- Dale!
- I'm comin' for you, buddy!
Tucker?!
Yeah.
Tuck! Tucker!
- Dale...
- Hey!
- Tucker.
- Dale, it's a trap.
- It's a what?
- It's a trap.
What?
Oh, no. Oh, no! Tuck, no!
I don't wanna die! Please!
Oh, God! Tucker!
Dale...
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad I'm not hung like a bear.
That's funny.
Dale... that kid, he's got some serious issues.
I know. Let's get you down from there.
Wait!
Sorry about that.
This vacation sucks.
Come on, let's go.
Look at this place.
- This is where evil lives.
- Let's just hope that Allison's still alive.
Allison!
- Allison!
- Chad?
- Chad?
- Shh!
What are you guys doing?
Saving you, stupid!
Come on. Let's go.
Why are you whispering?
There's no one else here.
This place is really freaky.
What have they done to you, Allie?
Huh?
They haven't done anything to me.
Chad, this has all been a huge misunderstanding.
We have to burn this place to the ground.
Destroy it completely.
What? No, no. Chad...
Chad! Stop.
No, Chad, no. Chad, stop!
You can't do this.
This is their vacation home.
You guys have to listen to me, OK?
Tucker and Dale did not mean to hurt anyone. They're really nice.
You have no idea... what this is all about, do you, Allison?
- Huh?
- No.
These freaks are evil... and they deserve everything that's coming to them.
OK, just relax, all right?
I'm just trying to explain this is all a big misunderstanding.
Tucker and Dale have been nothing but gentlemen to me this entire time,
- while you guys have been terrorizing them.
- But they started this!
By doing what? Saving my life?
Wait a minute. I remember reading about this in my sociology class.
It's called Stockholm syndrome.
When someone who's been kidnapped falls in love with their kidnapper.
You're falling in love with him?
No. W-What?
- Chad, the... The what? This is...
- Tell me... you're not falling in love with that freak, Allison.
How could you love him?
Chad, please. You don't understand.
Well, are you or are you not in love with him?
- What is the matter with you?
- Tell me!
Hey! Let the girl go.
- Are you OK, Allie?
- Allie? Did he just call you Allie?
Wait. Everyone just stop for a second and let's talk this out, OK?
Nobody wants to hurt anyone.
You could have fooled me.
- Fuck off, hillbilly.
- Eat shit, body perm.
Wait! How about I make some tea, and we all sit and talk this out?
Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll provide the finger sandwiches.
I'm gonna go get a beer.
OK, Chad, you...sit here, OK?
In this chair.
Dale, you... you sit in this one.
OK, good. Now, um...
I'm gonna get the tea.
Is that chamomile tea? I can't have that.
It fucks with my asthma.
It's Earl Grey.
Oh, I love Earl Grey. That's great.
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want you each to tell your side of the story, and as you're listening to the other person,
I want you to see yourself in their shoes.
OK?
OK.
Now, it's important that we communicate our feelings and understand each other's perspective before any progress can be made.
OK.
Chad, why don't you start?
- Well, where should I fucking begin?
- Wherever you'd like.
A long time ago,
- before I was born...
- OK, maybe not that far back.
This is important.
You see, my parents, they were attacked by hillbillies just like him.
It was 20 years ago.
The Memorial Day Massacre.
They brutally murdered everyone.
Just for fun.
My mother ran for her life.
But they captured hen
My father was helpless... and he didn't even know that she was pregnant with me yet.
And they forced him to watch... while they tortured hen
But my mom, she fought back...
- ..and she escaped.
But my father wasn’t so lucky.
His body was never found.
By the time I was born... my mother was already institutionalized.
I grew up hearing that story from my grandmother.
OK. Um...
Thank you for sharing with us, Chad.
- No, I'm not going in there!
- Hey, hey, hey.
Now, Chad said if they were gone longer than 15 minutes, we come in, guns blazing.
- But you don't even have a gun.
- Damn it, woman! Don't argue with me!
Are they drinking tea? Oh!
I would totally love a cup of tea right now.
No!
No way.
They're fucking trapped.
Oh...yeah.
Now, come on, we gotta do something.
It's your turn.
OK, well...
First of all...
I am really sorry that your family got massacred.
That is awful.
Secondly...
I didn't have anything to do with that, OK?
I mean, I would have been six years old at the time, so...
It may not have been you, but it was definitely your kind.
My kind? Now, hey, I can't even hurt a fish, can I, Tucker? I can't even hurt fish.
That's right.
He can't even hurt a fish.
I just can't do it!
OK. S-So now that you've both expressed your side of the story, how do you feel?
I feel better. I feel...
I feel like a weight... Yeah, I feel good.
Great. OK.
We're really making good progress.
It's show time, freaks!
Jason! No!
Jesus Christ!
Oh, shit, baby! Why didn't you duck?
Why didn't she duck?
Chad, st...
- Get him, Tucker!
Dale!
Go back to hell where you belong, freak!
Oh, shit!
Shit! Chad, what the fuck?
- Be calm. It's just the leg.
- Stop and roll.
- I'm on fire!
- No, don't use that.
Stop, drop, and roll!
- Get away from him!
- Stomp it out!
He's crackling like a log!
Oh, that stinks.
- Oh, shit!
- I knew I shoulda moved that.
- Allie, run!
- Run!
Come on, let's go!
Help me!
Get off of me, you nasty bitch!
My cabin.
Your cabin.
I'm a terrible therapist.
What? No, that's not true.
Don't say that.
I thought you did a great job in there.
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
I think we were on the verge of a breakthrough.
Thanks, Dale. That's really sweet.
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah.
I think we should go to the pickup truck right now.
Wait. Maybe we should help him.
- Argh!
- Never mind. Let's just go.
Get to the truck!
Tucker! Tucker!
He's coming!
- OK, come on, truck. Come on, truck.
- Come on, Dale. Go, go!
- Do not flood it.
- Do you wanna drive?!
- Guys, just go!
- Be careful with this.
This is the only thing I got left.
Go.
Crazy college kid can't catch us now!
- Dale, look out!
- Huh?
Jangers, not now, boy.
Jangers, hey!
Whoa. Jangers!
Allie.
Allison!
Jangers... Allison!
She's gone.
What the hell... Tucker?
Tucker, what happened?
Tucker, what hap...
He took her.
I tried to stop him.
Whoa, take it easy.
I tell you something, Dale.
It's gonna be a long time before I take a vacation again.
Oh, shit. Tucker, this is all my fault.
- Look at you.
- Nah.
I never should have talked to Allison.
You were right.
People like me and people like her just don't mix.
- That's not true.
- It is true!
I never should have even came out here with you.
Listen to me.
Do you remember when we was kids... and we used to go catch frogs down at that creek?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.
Remember how we used to compete to see who could catch more?
Yeah, but I don't think now's the time to talk about it, Tucker.
And I used to tell you that I let you catch more than me because I felt sorry for you.
I remember you used to let me lick 'em all, too.
That always made me feel kinda funny.
Yeah. Well, the thing is...
I didn't let you catch more.
You caught 'em on your own.
You was quicker than I was.
- Come on, Tucker.
- It's true.
What I'm trying to tell you... is that you're better than you think you are.
Listen to me. That girl sees it.
I've seen the way that the two of you look at each other.
You know, I think that she... really sees you for who you are.
Who knows?
Maybe after this is all done... you two can...
...date or something.
- I doubt it.
- Dude, that's what I'm talking about.
I don't want any more negativity.
- OK.
- Stop it!
- OK.
- You are a good man.
You're smart... and you're strong... and you're not as ugly as you think you are.
Thank you, Tucker.
That means a lot comin' from you.
- Life is short.
- I know.
You gotta go after what you want.
Go after her, Dale.
She needs you now more than ever, especially cos she's always falling down and hitting her head, knocking herself out.
- But I don't even know where he took her.
- Jangers'll know.
- OK, but I'm not leaving you here.
- No, no, no.
I'll be fine. Go.
- Friends forever?
- Best friends forever.
Oh, Jesus!
- God! Fuck...
- I'm sorry.
OK.
That hurt very much!
I could tell. Just breathe in.
Out through your mouth.
Go get her. Go get her.
- Do me a favor.
- Anything.
Kick the shit out of that little college dickhead for me, would you?
I'm gonna shove my boot down his fuckin' throat. You stay here, OK?
Come on, Jangers, let's go.
Good boy, Jangers. Good boy.
OK. You gotta let me take it from here, OK, pup?
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing.
More or less. OK, stay.
What is the matter with you?
What is the matter with me?
Do you have any idea what
I've been through trying to save you?
No.
You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison.
Now, I'm willing to forgive you... but you're gonna have to beg.
Chad...
Oh!
That was just not a very nice apology kiss.
You see, we're making up, Allie, so you have to be more passionate than that!
- Chad, please...
- That's a start.
- Please...
- You're getting warmer.
Just stop, please!
No. I'm not gonna stop.
I've only just begun.
You want a killer hillbilly?
I'll show you a killer hillbilly.
Allie! Allie! Hey, it's just me. Hey...
- It's OK.
- Dale?
- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?
What? Oh, I thought it might look kind of intimidating. Does it?
- Yeah.
- Sweet.
Dale, you wanna... you wanna help me here?
Oh, yeah. Hang on, I'm comin'.
Hang on.
- OK, what do we got here?
- Thank you for coming for me.
It's no big deal.
I was headed over this way anyway, so...
How sweet.
The dim-witted hillbilly is trying to save the girl of his dreams.
What kind of knot is this?
You think you're gonna win, but you're wrong.
It’s time to say goodbye to the girl.
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Allison.
No. Oh, jeez. No, no!
- Oh, Dale! Dale!
- OK. OK.
- OK, OK.
- Dale!
Hold on! OK, rabbit comes out the tree, rabbit goes around the tree...
- Dale, come on!
- OK! Jesus, OK!
Oh, that is really too bad.
Are you OK, huh?
Because I didn't mean to...
Dale!
Dale!
Dale!
It's time for you to feel my pain.
Bring it, frat bitch.
- Dale, over here!
- Come on! Let's get outta here.
Come on. Come on. Here! Come on!
Go! Go, get up there.
Go. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.
- Dale, here!
- Oh, yeah, give me that.
Put a couple boxes on there.
Oh, Jesus H Christ!
That kid is tough as nails.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- OK. OK.
- Looks like no one's been here for a while.
Yeah. What we need to find is some kind of weapon, something preferably big and sharp so I can stab him!
Nah! Shit...
Oh, hey! This might work, huh?
Or not.
Oh, my God. Dale?
- What?
- Come here and look at this.
Look.
- What?
- Something look familiar?
- Hey, ain't that that dead Sheriff right there?
- No, that picture.
- Look at the guy in the middle.
- Oh, yeah.
He looks just like that
Kentucky fried college kid down there.
- Yeah.
- That's funny.
And it says here, "The single survivor leads police to the Memorial Day Killer.
"The survivor is reported to have been tortured and raped.
"She's now undergoing psychiatric evaluation."
Think about it. He said his mother was captured and his father...
His father's body was never found.
I think we've just found him.
Holy S-H-I-T.
Jesus Christ!
Chad!
- Time to die, freak!
- Wait!
Just wait! Wait, wait!
Wait, Chad! Wait!
- You're a hillbilly, too!
- Shut up!
No! Look!
That's your real father.
Right there!
No. No!
It's true, Chad. You're half hillbilly.
It can't be.
They lied to me!
How could they?
Maybe they didn't want you to know the truth.
There is no truth!
Everything is a lie!
- What did you do?
- Anthemis nobilis.
- What?
- It's the ingredient in chamomile tea that causes an anaphylactic reaction in rare cases where people are allergic to it.
Like I said, I remember weird stuff.
But he'll be OK, as long as we get him his inhaler.
Or not.
OK, here we go. And, you ready?
- Uh, yeah, wait. My teeth. Do I got any...
- Teeth are clear.
- Clear? OK, just give me a second.
- And we're rolling.
The chaos and confusion of what transpired here last night is still being unraveled.
What appears to be a tragic mass suicide involving a group of mentally unstable college kids may in fact be the work of a lone deranged killer whose body has yet to be found.
- The killings happened on the ....
- Knock knock. Hey!
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- I'm feeling... high on prescription medication.
Yeah, looks like it.
They found my fingers.
Check it out.
- Yeah.
- I got to tell you...
I don't remember that one looking that way.
Does that look funny to you?
No. No, not really.
That looks natural. It's good.
By the way, I brought you something.
- Shut your eyes, OK?
- All right.
OK, open them.
Oh...
- Oh, buddy.
- That's a PBR, buddy.
That... that's a thing of beauty.
- It's cold, too, should be.
- Oh, oh...
Look what else I got you.
A bendy straw, your favorite sipping utensil.
There you go.
Mmm. Mm!
Don't choke. I'm gonna let you rest.
You enjoy that, OK?
Drink the whole thing.
When I come back, I'm gonna have more.
- Dale?
- Yeah?
Did you ask her?
- Ask her what?
- Did you ask her out, for God's sake?
Oh. Well ...
I was gonna, but then
I never actually got the chance, so...
Dale!
You are hopeless, you know that? You're hopeless.
Yeah. You're probably right about that.
Except for... she kinda mentioned to me that she's a pretty darn good bowler, so... we're goin' bowling.
- You little dickhead.
- I'm outta here.
Whoo! Yes.
- Dale Dobson, you are one lucky man.
- I guess it's just beginner's luck.
That girl has got an amazing set... of bowling fingers.
I know.
Listen, let me tell you something, OK?
Life is short, BJ.
You have to go after what you want, because it sure as heck fire ain't gonna just fall right into your lap.
- You know somethin'? You're right.
- I know.
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- OK. Right, now, listen to me, though.
Don't be nervous, and just be yourself, OK?
Yeah.
You got 'er. Go, buddy.
Hey.
- I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
- You are. That was great.
Listen, Allie, I hope you don't think this is too stupid or whatever, but I got you a little something.
Dale, that's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.
I know. I wanted to.
Oh, my gosh.
- You know what that is?
- Yes, it's a... it's a helmet.
It's a pink helmet.
I think, you know, it might just be better if you wear that every day from now on, so...
- OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.
It's perfect.
So, listen, Dale, I'm, uh...
I'm really sorry about everything that happened.
What do you mean?
For what? I had a great time.
I mean, except for all the people dying, when they were bleeding on us and everything.
That wasn't so much fun, but...you know...
I enjoyed every minute
I got to spend with you.
- Dale...
- You know what? Let me just say this, cos I don't know if we're ever gonna get to spend this kind of time together again, and I want to let you know that I...
I feel the same way.
- Really?
- Really.
BJ!
Oh, my God, should we go help her?
Hell, no.
Whatever.
I need a drink.
Here you go.
Okay, all right.
Katie Cumming?
Shaved.
- Very bad.
- Nice.
What about Molly Simmons?
Trimmed neatly.
I like it. I like that.
Holly fucking Dwyer?
Full bush, with a little treasure trail.
Fucking treasure turn pike.
Fucking treasure freeway with a car pool lane.
- Here we go.
- Yes.
Who invited you freaks?
So he walks up to her, he goes, "Open the vagina."
Come on. I never said that.
No, no wait.
She slaps the shit out of him, and so he says,
"Open the vagina, please."
Sarah Voizon?
Shaved.
Timmerman's sister?
Dude, she's seven.
Timmerman's mom?
Buckwheat in a scissor lock.
Janie Smith?
Trimmed.
You study for that history exam?
No.
Dude, that scared the shit out of me.
SECONDS APART
I can't see.
I can't see.
Popular kids, from what we're getting upstairs.
Jocks.
Football or basketball?
Football.
They had a game tomorrow.
Nobody heard the gun shots?
They had music cranked up pretty good.
- Who found them?
- Pizza guy.
Pizza guy? They ordered pizza?
Two.
Pizza guy strolled in at 11 :05.
So they commit suicide en masse, the night before the big game and they ordered pizza.
- En masse?
- My vocabulary is expanding.
Must be the literature.
Here's what I think happened.
Junior got a hold of papa's gun, started to have a friendly game of Russian roulette.
Things just got out of hand.
First kid commits suicide, blows his brains out.
That'd bring the game to a screeching halt, don't you think?
Can you feel it?
- But all the elements are there.
- Trimmed.
Then why can't we feel it?
The project takes time.
But everyone else feels it.
I feel it.
- Liar.
- Seriously.
There, the way he tilts his head.
No. It's in his eyes.
Bedtime, boys.
Five more minutes.
You heard your mother.
That scared the shit out of me.
Well, maybe next time.
I didn't feel it.
I know.
Trial and error, that's the nature of the project.
It's the genius of the project.
Exactly.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Now I got to run. Booked all morning.
You'll be home in time for dinner?
Word of honor.
Do you know how much I love you?
This much?
Not even close.
This much?
It is with great regret that I've summoned you here today.
The loss of these four fine young men has come as an abrupt and unexpected shock.
They were friends, scholars, athletes.
But above all, they were the embodiment of the phrase, "Men for others."
Let us pray.
"Our father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done."
Detective Lampkin.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Good book?
Yes, well, it does have its moments.
Poetics?
You mind if I...
Of course, for as long as you like.
Please.
Well, so far, most of the guests at the party don't remember a goddamn thing.
I was wondering if I could open it up a little bit.
Interview some friends, girlfriends, that sort of thing.
They were very popular boys.
I always wondered what that was like.
You heard anything?
Just a lot of teenage gossip.
That they were in a suicide club.
Some sort of satanic ritual, drugs.
Were they on drugs?
One of them tested positive for weed and that's about it.
Who?
Yes, well, I just hope that you can help us understand why they would kill themselves.
If, in fact, they did kill themselves.
What are you saying? That someone...
Suicide and homicide.
One can be made to resemble the other.
My uncle has diabetes.
He never takes care of it, though.
He's always losing toes.
- I'm new. What's your excuse?
- Reactive hypoglycemia.
- I'm Eve.
- Jonah.
Jonah, I'm looking for room 408A.
I had no trouble finding 401 through 407.
It's in the Dorsey Annex.
And where might that be?
Far from here.
You know, you strike me as a New Testament kind of guy.
Are you familiar with The Parable of the Good Samaritan?
Luke 10, verses 30 to 37.
Great.
Let's pretend that you are the Good Samaritan and I'm on the side of the road.
Show me a little mercy, it's my first day.
All right, follow me.
Pencils down.
They didn't even ask about the Great Western Schism.
So, should we focus on the next project?
Who?
The one who made you late.
No.
We should stick to the program.
Lay low for a while and then...
Feed the birds?
Yeah. Feed the birds.
All right, Vargo. Back to class.
Ms. Dunn.
Ms. Dunn, I know this must be real difficult for you.
Lots of people.
Lots of people what?
You're gonna ask me the same thing that you've asked everybody else.
Do I know anybody who would wanna hurt those boys?
I know lots of people. They're jerks.
- Including Derek?
- Especially Derek.
How long did you two date?
I saw them kill a dog once.
Derek and his friends?
A chow chow.
They look like lions, don't they?
They do that to your arm, too?
No, I was in a movie once.
They like making movies.
Who likes making movies?
Were they at the party?
Even if they were, nobody would remember them.
Twins with the camera.
How do you forget something like that?
Jonah Trimble?
Seth.
Good enough.
Let's say we talk for a little while?
Is this seat taken?
- Gum?
- It's not allowed.
That's a keeper.
It's a shame what happened to them boys, ain't it?
Friends of yours?
We don't have any friends.
You know Elvis had a twin?
I didn't.
Brother was stillborn.
Elvis was the first, then came the dead one.
You imagine that? Two Elvises.
Wow.
What do you want?
So my real name is Kristen, but if you ever call me that,
I'll have to kill you.
- I'm from Salem.
- Massachusetts?
Oregon. Vancouver before that.
British Columbia?
Washington.
Before that, Hollywood.
California?
Florida.
- My mom relocates a lot.
- For work?
For love.
I mean she thinks it's love.
It looks like love on paper, but it never really works out.
I'm just trying to make sense of this tragedy.
Maybe you should see one of the grief counselors.
Maybe you should.
I'm not experiencing any grief.
Really?
Not even...
What's it called when you question God and what not?
- Existential.
- Right.
Not even that. That a crime?
Not in this state.
Good. So I guess we're through.
Now, withholding evidence, that's a crime.
We've known each other ever since we were eight.
She was the only other kid on my block, besides me, who knew the words to American Pie.
- Where?
- Kansas City.
Missouri?
Kansas.
Now, neighbor lady says she saw twin boys, about your age, head into the party, with the video camera rolling.
Now what I can't figure out is how come none of the guests recall you being there.
When you're not popular in high school, you might as well be invisible.
So you were there.
Never said I wasn't.
But we left before anything happened.
I think we gonna have to let the video camera speak for itself.
I'm sorry but there is no video.
I mean, there would have been, but my brother, dumbass, forgot to put the memory card in the camera.
Seems like a real simple mistake for boys with such high SAT scores, don't it?
I'm gonna have to talk to your parents.
They're out of town.
- Where?
- They're in Aspen.
Your brother says Vail.
My brother wouldn't say that.
Why not?
Because they're in Aspen.
My God.
It is uncanny.
How far apart?
Ninety-three seconds.
- You're the older one, I bet, right?
- Younger.
Taller by a few inches, though.
Shorter by less than one.
Shorter by less than one.
What can you tell me about the video camera?
Your brother says that you, dumbass, forgot to load the memory card in the camera.
There you have it.
Don't get mad at me.
- I'm just repeating what he said.
- I'm not mad.
No?
You're the sensitive one.
Gum?
I'm diabetic.
Not so funny second time around.
Dumbass?
Cops dig the vernacular.
- Puts them at ease.
- How considerate of you.
Come on.
You know what they're trying to do.
He was smart to keep us apart.
Just lucky.
Lying about the neighbor, that was kind of clever.
Are you worried?
Not at all.
We covered our tracks. He's fishing.
Yeah.
But somebody told him something.
So let's find out who.
What in God's name are you two doing here?
You said you had an open door policy.
It's after 8:00.
How the hell did you get in here?
You said if anyone had a problem they can come to you.
Anytime, 24/7.
Not now. No...
- I thought I saw...
- Rats?
You're more likely to find those among the student body.
- What are you talking about?
- Who ratted us out, Frank?
How dare you?
In Africa, they get to be the size of small dogs.
Is that why you left?
I'm gonna have you little bastards expelled, you hear me?
Now get out.
Out!
You were just hitting your stride as a missionary.
Why'd you leave?
I got...
I got sick.
With what?
- Dracu...
- Dracunculus.
The Guinea worm.
I find parasites much more interesting than rats.
Did you know we spent a whole week on parasites in biology class?
- The Guinea worm is our favorite.
- By far.
Infection can be caused by drinking contaminated water.
The worm matures in the host's body, growing up to six feet long.
After about a year, it migrates towards the surface.
In 90% of the cases...
The worm will emerge from the leg or the foot.
The worm needs to be rolled out onto a small stick.
Caution must be exercised during removal,
Frank.
If it breaks...
What happens if it breaks?
Crippled.
Right, you can lose a leg.
Or worse.
Now back to my original question, Frank.
Who ratted us out?
I can't hear you.
Katie.
Really?
Guess we didn't make enough of an impression on her.
Please, please.
No.
Looks like you'll have to dig it out yourself.
Dig out? No!
I found this in the contraband drawer.
He cut an artery. Bled out in minutes.
You get a shot of this?
Maybe he was trying to get to the phone.
Maybe he was trying to tell us something else.
How you doing, Lampkin?
Larry, I want you to be the first to know, this is my last pack of cigarettes.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
Oh, man. Seriously, my wife says she's gonna divorce me if I don't quit.
Figure I'm gonna have two on the ride home, park a block away, have one in the car and two on the porch. Shit, maybe three.
How many that make?
Fuck 'em all but nine.
- Come again.
- We used to say that back in Nam.
Six for pallbearers.
Two for the road guards.
One to count cadence.
Fuck 'em all but nine.
Fuck 'em all but nine.
Maybel?
Maybel!
I can't see. I can't see.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
Welcome to pain management for the new millennium, Detective.
Distract the mind from what's happening to the body.
Send you on a little trip, while we scrub you down.
We need to escalate.
Haven't we done enough lately?
They're just trying to make sense out of this tragedy.
- We need to talk about Katie.
- No.
Morning, Katie.
She's a loose end.
The quicker we take care of her, the quicker we can get back to the project.
I think we should take a break for a while.
Why? What about feeding the birds?
Holy shit.
- I can tell the difference.
- You can?
You have a scar by your eye.
And you have a squiggly thing on your iris.
I do?
It's kind of cool.
I'm Seth.
Eve.
Nice to meet you, Eve.
You know, Jonah and I have been working on this little project.
- Seth.
- What kind of project?
It's a movie.
- You wanna be in it?
- No.
Sure.
I mean, how do we even know she can act?
Audition me.
Sounds pretty reasonable to me.
Don't we have someone else in mind?
Do we?
Yes. We do.
- I want her.
- Good, let's have her.
No, just me.
- All to yourself?
- Yes.
- You wouldn't know what to do with her.
- I know what not to do with her.
I've learned from our mistakes.
Katie.
Katie.
Daddy?
Yes, Katie, it's me.
How's my little angel?
Daddy, I miss you so much.
I miss you, too.
How's my little girl?
It's okay.
I know about the abortion.
How you can't have children.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Sweetheart, do you know where I am?
Heaven.
Would you like to be with me?
Yes, I would.
I wanna see you.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy?
Katie?
Stay the fuck away from me.
Put the glass down.
No!
- Another suicide.
- And you believe that?
This time, we got a bunch of witnesses.
Including our boys?
Trimble, Jonah and Seth, they were sitting right there.
What makes you think they're witnesses?
What's your point?
My point is maybe they had something to do with it.
Well, your point is moot.
Moot?
I'm expanding my vocabulary.
Books?
Books on tape.
Look, Detective, I got 15 witnesses says those boys never laid a finger on her.
Maybe they didn't have to.
She's as same as the others.
No. She's better.
I feel it.
Liar.
Maybe it's your blood sugar.
I'll make you a sandwich.
I'm not hungry.
Where's Jonah?
I don't know.
Not your brother's keeper, huh?
You know the game Hacky Sack?
Me and my buddies used to play it in college.
I remember this one time we were playing and this feeling came over me.
Sadness.
Found out my father died that day.
While you were playing Hacky Sack?
I've been reading up the last couple of nights about twins.
And a lot of people say that twins have a special connection.
Started to think you and your brother have a special connection.
Like you and your wife?
My wife?
What were you doing when she died?
Playing canasta?
Don't talk about my wife.
Were you freaked out?
Not really.
What about the blood?
There wasn't that much blood.
You know what I mean.
Someone offs themselves in front of you, there's an effect, right?
There's supposed to be.
I've been to five schools in three years and I can honestly say,
I've never met anyone like you.
Really?
Well, well, well.
I need to borrow your boyfriend for a minute.
I'm not her boyfriend.
She didn't seem to mind the label much.
Seth, on the other hand, did not look happy because he felt left out.
God with the football team this year?
God was always with our football team.
Not so much the water polo team.
I was never much into sports myself.
Too much like you.
Too damn sensitive.
Your interrogation technique sucks.
See that's not you talking. That's Seth.
Seth must have really gotten to you.
He said some hurtful things about my wife.
I lost control.
Hell, I think any man would.
I think you would have stood up for somebody that you care about.
She met your parents yet?
No.
Think it's about time I did.
May I help you?
Excuse me. I...
I knocked loud, twice, and no one came to the door.
I'm Detective Lampkin.
Detective Lampkin.
Our sons told us about you.
I'm sure they did.
Nice home.
You know, my mama, she used to...
She used to work as a housekeeper in a beautiful home.
Like this.
How long you've been living here?
This house has been in my family for many years.
You mind if I...
No.
You know, I couldn't afford this place with my salary and my pension.
What kind of square footage are you looking at?
About 4,000.
You know, my house right here,
I'm standing in my kitchenette, and I take two steps, little steps,
I'm in the alley way.
Sounds claustrophobic.
Like a jail cell.
- Where are your boys?
- Upstairs.
I am sure that they have informed you about the recent tragedies.
We're still in shock.
I'm advising all the parents to communicate with their children.
Help us sort out this mess.
We did and we have.
We have great communication with our boys.
They mention the video?
Unfortunately there is no video,
Detective Lampkin.
I wish there had been.
Perhaps it could have helped you make sense of things.
They ever talked to you about their gift?
I should hope they have more than one gift.
Gift I'm referring to is less conventional.
I'm not sure I'm following you.
How was Aspen?
I don't see what this has to do with it.
We stayed at a little bed and breakfast.
Which one?
I'm sure you've never heard of it.
Try me.
Elsa's Landing.
Honeymoon suite.
Do you know it?
We even brought back a little souvenir.
Right over there.
My wife and I used to go there.
It's lovely, isn't it?
Yeah.
Anything else, Detective?
No.
Thank you for your time.
Ma'am.
Oh, and Detective.
You lay a hand on one of my boys again and you can kiss that little pension of yours goodbye, understood?
Yes, ma'am.
You're on work study?
I just needed to get away.
The police asked me about you.
I know.
Should I be worried?
Maybe.
Do you play?
No.
Here.
That's good.
- Good job.
- Yeah?
So where do you live?
Santa Maria, by Dunham.
Fancy.
Do you want to hang out there?
I'm not allowed to have guests over.
Then we'll go to my house.
I can't see.
I can't see.
Excuse me, so sorry to bother you.
- Can you help us out?
- We are kind of stranded here.
I...
I just parked my wheels right over there.
Thought I was seeing double back there for a second.
I guess you guys get that a lot, huh?
Twin jokes?
Less than you think.
So, Kirby, do you?
- What?
- You know, feed the birds.
Did I say my name was Kirby?
This isn't the way to Grandma's house.
Yeah, we blew past that like three miles ago.
Don't worry.
I know a way.
You ever hold a little bird in your hand?
It's so light.
Deceptively light.
It's an aerodynamic thing, I guess.
Well, boys at your age are like little birds.
I guess you realize I do at the carnival, but you pick one up...
Mother?
Mother?
It's okay.
Mother.
Kirby, help.
Mommy.
Mom!
Here it comes.
Hey!
Hey!
- Why did you get in the car?
- We needed a ride.
- You needed a ride where?
- The mall.
We told him to stop but he just kept going.
Jonah grabbed the wheel and the car started swerving.
Then I pulled the emergency brake.
And the rest is on video. Why?
Evidence.
Figured we could show it to the police when we got away.
We didn't see the truck coming until it was too late.
The driver says, he's been taking that same route every Saturday morning for the last five years.
Company log says he ain't lying.
Neither are we.
I think you knew that truck was coming.
I think you tricked that man into giving you a ride.
And I think you used your unique talents to kill him.
Right, you think we have these weird powers.
You know, my dad called his lawyer last night.
Not because you hit me.
It's no big deal.
You were upset.
It was just to see what our rights are.
He says what you're doing is harassment.
This is not Salem.
It's what he said.
Wormwood wants you.
What the hell are you doing in there?
Interviewing suspects.
We have our suspect, right here.
Kirby LeFleur.
Busted in '91 for indecent exposure.
Graduated to criminal misconduct with a minor in '94.
Did a seven-year stretch for accosting a child.
As far as I'm concerned, those kids were abducted by a sexual predator who should have invested in a AAA membership.
That's what they want you to think.
They can get inside of people's heads.
I've seen them.
Did I bring you back too soon?
Let them go, Detective.
This isn't Salem.
This time he deserved it.
He's a goddamn pedophile.
Then why didn't it make a difference?
Why didn't we feel a fucking thing?
It's the nature of the project, all right? Trial and error.
It's the genius of the project.
It's just not working.
Come on.
You know we have it in us, all right.
Remember when we were little before the babysitter?
- I think that part of us is broken.
- Why?
I'm done wasting my time.
It's her, isn't it?
No.
You can't abandon the project.
I just did.
He just doesn't get it. I can't do this.
- Do what?
- The project.
We're not the same anymore.
- I'm not making any sense.
- No, it's okay.
You're just upset.
I'm glad you called me.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
Who's your friend?
Jonah Trimble.
Hi, Jonah Trimble. I'm Brenda.
Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.
- Okay, Mom.
All right, honey, I'm gonna go lay down.
I'm sorry about my mom.
She's much more interesting when she's sober.
I liked her.
- Not too much, I hope.
- No.
I bet you have the perfect parents.
I used to think so as a kid.
What does your dad do?
He was a doctor.
What does he do now?
He's a doctor.
You said "was."
- I wasn't. I was just...
- I don't wear thongs.
I mean, I know most girls do but I don't like the way they feel.
Do you know, one time, a boy broke up with me just because I didn't wear one.
Can you believe that?
I bet you wear boxers.
Ask me another question.
- I didn't ask you anything.
- On a boat.
- What?
- My first time was on a boat.
On the Lake of Ozarks.
You know where that is?
Ask me another question.
- I can't think of any.
- Some football player, some jerk.
What was it like?
It hurt.
Here.
That's what I like to listen to.
- How old were you?
- Fourteen.
Listen.
It's beautiful.
- What's wrong?
- I should go home.
- You're not into me?
- No. I am.
- It's just I...
- Wanna take things slow?
Yeah.
You're weird.
I know.
I'll see you later?
Here.
So I can tell you apart.
I know you feel it with her.
Of course not.
It's why you don't need the project anymore.
I need some protein.
Maybe I should go see her.
Stay away from her.
Nice ring.
What's going on up there?
Nothing.
Hold me.
I can't see.
Linda, I need to go back there.
I don't see any fresh burns on you, Detective.
Anyway, we're done for today.
Please, I just need to escape.
I'm sorry it's just...
My wife and I used to go here.
Yeah.
- Happy birthday, Jonah.
- Happy birthday, you two!
Happy birthday, my two sweet boys.
That's the way, boys. Good job.
It's about a girl, isn't it?
At your age, it's always about a girl.
Or God.
I don't believe in God.
You were always my favorite.
Really?
Is she beautiful?
Yeah.
I used to be beautiful, too.
You still are.
You're the most beautiful mother in the entire world.
Having twins, it ruined me.
See the stretch marks?
I'm sorry.
Touch it.
It's okay.
You sucked the life out of me.
Look, the babysitter.
She's so beautiful.
Remember the babysitter?
Things really seem to be falling apart.
Yes.
It's strange.
Time for your shot.
Dr. Elder?
Dr. Elder is dead.
- I'm Detective Lampkin.
- I'm Dr. Houska.
We used to be partners.
Well, they came here to get pregnant.
That's what we do.
Or it's what we did.
How does that work? Drug?
Well, it depends on the patient.
Depends on the couple.
I'm asking about the Trimbles.
Can I see your credentials again, please, Detective?
- About that time, isn't it?
- Excuse me?
I don't mean to compare you with the local street addict but a jones is a jones, ain't it though?
Listen, I have a consultation I have to make.
So please. Hey! Hey! Get your hands...
I'm not asking you to compromise your high ethical standards.
Just allow me to compromise mine, okay?
All right, Detective, you're on your own.
What happened?
You went to instant shock because you've been eating like shit.
Come on, time for school.
Sorry about last night.
Catholic guilt?
I fell asleep.
Me, too. I was out like a light.
Why did you leave again?
- What?
- You could have stayed the night.
My mom's cool.
What's wrong?
I never do that.
I mean,
I try to get to know the guy first.
Listen, if some of the stuff that I said...
I hope I didn't scare you away.
I haven't been scared since I was little.
- I take it you're pissed.
- Fuck you! Why?
To keep you in your place.
Shut up!
We're the same!
Jonah!
Couldn't tell the difference, you fucking idiot!
Well, I'll be damned.
...color of television and radio as well as stereo recording.
This fabulous home entertainment center will be yours if The Price Is Right, priced authority.
Thank you, Don. And thank you, ladies.
Mr. Ritner, we begin with you.
Minimum is 50. You may start anywhere.
Oh, my God.
Did Seth do that?
No. I did it.
Owen.
Does it hurt?
Now they'll be able to tell us apart.
...Fifty, that's the minimum. $1500.
Mr. Ritner, you're picking up where you left off.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm your favorite right?
Sweetie, I love you both just the same.
No. No.
You said I was your favorite.
Did I?
I can't remember.
He says we're just the same, but I'm not like him, right?
We're all special in God's eyes.
I've got the scar. I've got the scar.
Sweetie, it's just a tiny little scar.
He fucked my girl!
Poor thing.
His heart's broken.
Son.
It'll all come out in the wash.
What kind of parents are you?
Good question.
It's okay, Jonah.
It's gonna be okay.
You're not like him.
Mommy. Make him leave.
Mommy's not too talkative right now.
Especially when Seth's not around.
Where is he?
I don't know.
It's harder to do when he's not around, isn't it?
Get out.
It's harder to pull the wool over your own eyes.
Daddy?
Make him leave.
I see what's happening.
You know what's happening, Jonah?
I remember now.
It started with the babysitter.
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
What is this?
I did this to protect us.
Excuse me.
I had knocked loud twice, but no one answered so...
I'm Detective Lampkin.
Nice home.
You killed them?
No.
I'm sorry.
Listen.
They're ruling this as suicide.
We know differently.
They killed her.
We just need to keep them apart.
It's just the house.
I'm scared of them.
They wouldn't hurt us.
Then why are we whispering?
Do you remember how badly we wanted a child?
How we prayed?
I went to those doctors...
It's not our fault.
It's my fault.
I let them put those drugs in me.
We just need to keep them apart.
Do you know how much I love you?
This much?
Not even close.
This much?
This much?
I can make things right, now. Trust me.
I can protect us.
Like the way I always have.
No. It needs to end. Right now.
I don't need you anymore.
What are you doing?
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
You fucking need me.
You need me.
Get away from him.
Wow.
Where was that enthusiasm last night?
'Cause I thought I was fucking a glass of water but, hey, I'm willing...
- Please get up.
- Seth.
Get up.
Stay away!
This is your fault! You fucking whore.
I'm gonna make you watch.
Help!
Help!
I can't see.
Can you feel it?
Yeah.
Finally.
It's beautiful.
I'm scared.
Me, too.
THE REEF
THE REEF
Based On Actual Events
Hey, hey! Hello, mate.
- Oh, it's good to see you.
- You too.
- How are you?
- Great.
Luke, this is my girlfriend, Suzie.
Suzie, Luke.
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- And you know my sister Kate.
- Kate.
- Luke.
- Looking good.
- Thanks. I'll take that.
- Thank you.
- Let's go.
- Wow, you really bought a car?
- No.
After our sail, I've gotta deliver the boat to Indonesia, and the guy who's crewing for me owns this.
- We're not keeping you from delivering?
- No, it's all good.
I can't believe you get to sail around the world delivering boats for a living.
How fantastic.
Go introduce yourselves to Wazza.
The scruffy-looking one fishing off a yacht.
- Cool.
- Great.
See you soon.
So how have you been?
Good. Good. You?
Yeah, good. I'm going to get some spark plugs. You wanna come?
Sure.
- Shane.
- Hey.
- Is Lou here?
- Yeah, he's just out the back.
- Hey, Lou.
- Yeah, out here!
- It's pretty impressive.
- Yeah.
That's a mako, tiger, hammerhead.
And that one's a white pointer.
Where'd you get these?
- Out there.
- Here?
Yeah. Strange about the white pointer, though.
People reckon they don't usually come this far north.
Don't worry. What do they say?
You're more likely to die from a bee sting than get killed by a shark.
- Wazza.
- Hey.
- Kate. Kate, Warren.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How you going?
- Good.
- Welcome aboard.
- It's not bad.
- She's a bit scruffy, but she'll do.
I'll show you where you're sleeping.
This brings back memories.
- This is yours.
- Hey, so... I bought you something.
I wonder what this could be?
Thank you.
I really miss you.
- Sorry.
- It's OK.
- Is there someone else?
- No, there's nobody else. It's just...
You wanted a break and now you're back.
Matt really wanted me to come, and a holiday sounded like a good idea.
So that's what this is, it's just a holiday?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here for a holiday.
OK. Good.
I've gotta go up.
Wanna catch the outgoing tide.
OK.
Oh, wow. Did you just catch that?
Yep. These waters are full of 'em.
- Cool.
- You in from Sydney?
Yeah, my brother and his girlfriend are here from London.
And you're crewing with Luke to Indonesia?
- Yeah.
- Have you crewed with him before?
No. No, this is the first time.
I usually work the fishing boats.
Thought I'd try something different.
- You've crewed with him, haven't you?
- How do you know that?
- He talks a bit about you.
- Oh.
Yeah, yeah, we sailed the Mediterranean together.
Whoa! Looks like we're off.
So where are we heading?
Cygnet Reef. I wanna try and get there by this afternoon.
Sounds great. What's there?
You'll see.
Hey, we're here.
- You good? See you.
- Bye!
Have fun!
See you soon.
Sorry.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Come with me.
Wow.
Wow, wow.
- How was that?
- Amazing.
- Is this your favourite spot?
- Actually, I've never been here before.
- Wanna go for a bit of an explore?
- Yep.
No.
Oh.
Look what I found.
Beautiful.
What?
I don't know.
Is this just sex or is it something else?
I don't know.
You know what I think?
I think you're scared.
- Scared?
- Mm-hm.
- Scared of what?
- Me.
You. Us.
No, that's not it.
What is it, then?
I don't know.
- Come on, Kate, what?
- I don't know.
One minute we're having a good time, and now we're not.
- I'll tell you what I think.
- I don't really care what you think.
Hey, Luke, Kate!
There's something up with Warren.
Tide's dropping really fast.
We hit bottom.
Kate, can you keep an eye out?
- I think it's leaking.
- Eh?
- You're scraping.
- The tide's dropping really fast.
I tried the engine.
She won't start.
- OK, try now.
- Nothing.
- Now.
- No, nothing.
Jump on the anchor.
Katie, can you get the sail, please?
Yeah.
Channel's opened up!
OK, I think we're out of trouble.
Thanks, guys.
Hey, Waz, take a look at that engine, yeah?
Katie, steer.
- Sure.
- Keep her straight, yeah?
- We'll just keep it straight.
- Yeah.
So, who wants a go?
- Suze?
- Me?
- Yeah, come on. Chance of a lifetime.
- Go on. Go on.
Two hands.
Good.
- Sailing.
- Hey!
Arr! Arr!
Hey. Thought I'd come up and catch the morning.
It's gorgeous.
I'm really sorry about yesterday.
Yeah. Me too.
- It's tricky, isn't it?
- Yeah.
You don't have any doubts about us?
Plenty.
It's just, you know,
I really missed you.
I really missed you too.
- You hungry?
- Starving.
- Brekky?
- Yes, please.
Matt! Warren!
You all right? We've gotta get out of here. It could go down.
Where's Matt? Matt? Matt?
Luke! Matt!
Oh, Suzie.
Mattie! Warren!
You all right?
I'm gonna go down and get Matt.
Hey, Warren, you gotta get out.
Come with me, right? Take a deep breath.
- Matt. Where's Matt?
- Matt? Where's Matt?
Matt! Mattie?
Here! I'm here.
It's stuck.
This way, this way, this way.
OK, follow me.
You all right? You OK?
Yeah? You OK?
- Let's get out of the water.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Gonna have to push him.
- Yeah, OK.
One, two, three!
Up you get.
All right, who's next?
- You got me?
- Come on.
OK, here we go. More hands.
- You all right, Suze?
- Yeah.
Fuck. Look at that.
Keel's been ripped off.
- You OK?
- It's OK. You all right?
Yeah.
- What happened?
- Don't know.
Must have hit something.
Reef. A whale.
The bulkheads are fucked.
OK, guys, I don't think we should stay here.
There's a current.
We're drifting further out to sea.
The boat's fucked.
I don't think it's gonna stay afloat.
And when we do sink, we're in the water, just further from land.
- It mightn't sink.
- Well, is there an EPIRB?
- What's an EPIRB?
- A distress beacon. Yeah, there is.
Yeah, but it's an old one, so you need a plane to fly over to get a signal.
- We're not in a flight path.
- How do you know that?
Seen any planes in the last few days?
OK, I'm not saying we should try and swim to the mainland, but I reckon we could make Turtle Is land.
No.
- What are you doing?
- Point the 12 at the sun.
Split the angle between the 12 and the hour hand. That's north.
So, we're here, right?
Turtle Is land is here.
Now, we weren't going straight there, because there's a reef here.
But with the current, I reckon if we swim north, we'll hit the island.
- How far would we have to swim?
- Uh... 10, 12 miles.
Good luck.
I've fished these waters, mate.
I know what's out there.
I'm not getting in that water.
What makes you think they're not gonna come here?
There's all sorts of shit starting to rot.
I don't wanna argue with you, mate, honestly I don't. I just...
I'm not getting in the water.
All right, look, yeah, there might be sharks, I don't know.
What I do know is that there's land over there and the longer we sit here, the further we get away from it.
We either swim for it and try and save ourselves, while we've still got enough strength, or we can stay here and hope the boat doesn't sink and that someone comes for us.
And they'd better come soon, because otherwise we'll die of dehydration.
I'm not a great swimmer.
I don't think I could swim that far.
Yeah, no. Me neither.
OK.
All right. I'll go down below and see what I can find to keep us afloat.
You need a hand?
Yeah, if you're in the water,
I'll pass out whatever I find, yeah?
- You OK?
- Yeah.
- Here goes.
- OK.
Luke! Luke!
Hey, Luke! Luke!
Luke, mate, can you hear me?
There's something in the water.
Hey! Luke, quickly, get out! It's close!
Get out now! Get out!
Luke, there's something in the water! Could be a shark!
Luke, come on! Hurry up!
Get out! Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
Something broke the surface, over there.
- Well, what was it?
- I don't know, but it was big.
All right.
I've still got to find the EPIRB.
So unless you see a really big shark, don't warn me.
See you soon.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Found it.
- You know how to kick it off?
- It's good, mate.
Yeah? OK, great.
Try that.
- For you.
- Thanks, mate.
- What? What's the matter?
- You'll look like a seal in that.
Sharks love seals.
Mate, you don't wanna come, that's your business.
Don't go scaring everyone else, all right?
Maybe we should wait.
OK, it's your choice.
Look, I know this is a difficult decision, but it's really easy not to get found out here.
This boat's gonna sink and it's gonna sink soon.
There's land over there and that's where I think we should be going.
I'm going with Luke.
Me too.
That's yours.
Here you go. Take that. Yours.
- I'm not going.
- Hey?
I'm gonna stay here.
It's a better option than staying on the boat.
What, swimming to an island you can't see?
Kate...
OK.
- OK, that's for you.
- Thanks.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah?
- We'll send someone as soon as we can.
- OK.
- OK?
- Yep.
See you, mate.
See you soon.
Bye.
- See you back there.
- Definitely.
What are you doing?
You know he knows the ocean more than any of us.
- Come on, Katie, come with us.
- I can't.
I just... I just can't.
- See you later, sis.
- Bye.
Yeah?
OK, let's go.
- You look after her for me, all right?
- I will, don't worry. We're good.
OK, so let's stick together.
We're gonna get tired, but if we just stay at a steady pace, we'll get there, yeah?
Apart from that, relax and enjoy.
It's a once in a lifetime.
Let's go.
Hey, guys!
- Not so much splashing.
- Did you see something?
- No.
- Hey! Hey, wait!
Wait! I'm gonna come with you!
Come on. Come with us.
- No.
- Are you sure?
Yeah, no, you go. I'll be right.
This is nuts.
I hope you're right about this.
You're not the only one.
Guys, don't worry, we'll make it.
We'll get there.
- Here, take this.
- Are you sure?
Yeah, it's all right.
We'll share this one.
Thanks.
Hey, guys. We're tired.
So we focus our energy, huh?
Imagine there's a guy with a huge rope pulling us towards the island.
- Or towards my bed.
- Mm.
- There's always the last resort.
- What's that?
When I'm at the gym and I'm trying to break through the pain barrier,
I imagine that I'm having sex.
While you're doing weights, you're imagining you're screwing?
Not just screwing.
There's foreplay as well.
Well, isn't there?
Not often.
Oh, come on!
Don't listen to her.
- Shit. What was that?
- What?
Oh!
What is it?
Can't see anything.
I think it's a school of small fish.
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.
OK, let's keep going.
Come on.
- What is it?
- Looks like a shell.
- It's a turtle shell.
- Yeah, I think you're right.
A turtle?
Hey, Matt.
Mattie.
Oh, fuck!
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Suze.
Hey, we can't stay here.
Come on.
I don't wanna stretch my legs out,
I really don't.
- OK, all right.
- I can't move.
It's all right. Listen, we've gotta go.
So do you want me to go behind you?
Come on, love.
I'll go behind you, OK?
I got you.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
- That was a big turtle.
- Fuck, yeah.
What was that?
- What?
- Over there, I saw something.
I can't see anything.
- Suzie, you're freaking me out.
- What's the matter?
- There's something here.
- We have to keep going.
- There's something following us.
- Suze, this is the ocean, OK?
There's a million things out here, bub.
We've gotta keep going.
We've gotta get going.
Come on. Gotta go, all right?
- It's all right.
- There!
- All right, Suze, listen...
- I'm sure I saw something and it's big!
- OK, so what did you see?
- I don't know. There! There, look.
I can't see anything.
Over there.
- Did you see something?
- Don't know. Maybe.
- I told you.
- What was it?
- Was it a shark?
- I don't know, OK?
Let's keep going.
- OK, it's a shark.
- How big?
It's big. It's all right. Come together.
I can't see it.
Get in together.
Can you see it?
Luke, can you see it?
I think it's gone.
I can't see it anywhere.
Let's go. Let's go.
We've gotta go this way.
This way.
It's OK, it's OK.
I can't see it. It's moved away.
It's OK. I can't see it. I can't see it.
You need to calm down.
I can't see it. It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.
You have to stay calm.
Katie. Katie.
Katie. Katie. Katie.
Take some deep breaths with me.
Deep breaths. Come on.
You'll be all right. It's not gonna get you. It's not gonna get you.
Take a deep breath.
It's gonna be all right.
Deep breath.
That's it. That's it.
Matt. Matt.
Hey, Mattie.
Matt.
Matt.
- Matt!
- Matt!
- Matt!
- Matthew!
Matt! Matt!
Matt! Mattie!
Matt!
There he is. Mattie!
No! Go! Go!
My fucking leg's gone!
No! Go! No!
My leg's gone. You gotta...
No, you gotta go!
- You gotta leave me!
- It's OK, it's OK.
- Swim. I'm useless to you.
- No, you're coming with us.
- Mattie, it's OK.
- He's gonna... He's gonna come back.
Mattie, Mattie, Look at me.
It's OK. Just stay with me.
- Quick, before he... before he...
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
Mattie. Mattie.
Matt. Mattie.
Matt. Matt, come on, come on.
Wake up. Wake up.
Please wake up. Wake up.
Wake up, wake up.
Come on. Mattie, wake up!
Wake up! Please wake up!
Wake up. Please.
Katie!
Katie, get out of there now!
Oh, God. I love you.
Katie!
- Come on!
- Oh, God. I love you.
Hey.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
- Did you say something?
- No.
- What?
- You said something.
It's gonna come back, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Didn't you say we'd be there in three hours?
How are we gonna get there now?
We're lost in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the fucking night!
- Suzie...
- We never should have listened to you.
We should have stayed on the boat with Warren.
And now Matt's dead!
And soon we're gonna be too!
- We're fucked! We're so fucked!
- Suzie!
We're so...
I'm sorry about Matt.
And I'm sorry about all of this.
Luke, it's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
You didn't make us come with you.
It's all right.
It's all right. Hey.
It's all right.
What was that?
Oh, my God.
Come together. Come together.
Oh, my God!
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!
Please! Help us!
Oh, God, somebody help us!
Hey.
- Hey.
- Look.
Oh. Hey.
Suze.
Look.
Whoo!
OK, be careful, huh? It's very sharp.
Oh, it's so good to be out of the water.
It's not Turtle Is land, but it's land.
Let's keep going, then.
Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so sore.
- Me too.
What?
I don't know.
Get back.
Oh! It's a fucking dolphin.
Moving pretty fast.
The current must have picked up.
Finally the current is helping.
Is that the dolphin?
Suzie! Suzie!
Suzie!
Oh, fuck.
It's OK. Come on.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Poor Suzie.
It's the same one, isn't it?
I think so.
It is. I know it is.
There's some more reef.
I think we should go.
Luke! Luke!
Luke!
Luke! Luke!
Come on. Come on.
Come on, Luke.
Come on. Come on, let's go.
I... No.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
My... My foot, it's bleeding.
Oh, shit.
Sorry.
Thanks.
It's OK.
I love you, Luke.
I love you too.
- You ready?
- No.
Me neither.
Let's go.
Swim. Fucking swim!
Come on, babe.
Come on.
Come on! Go!
Come on!
Go! Go!
Pull me up! Pull me up!
Take me! Take me!
Pull me up! Pull me up!
Come on. I can't!
- Come on! Come on!
- Get me up!
Pull me up! Pull me up!
Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
Please come home.
Please come home. Please.

Hi. Package for
Brian Griffin.
Oh, I can sign for that.
Package, Bri.
Huh. Wonder what this is.
It's my book.
And there's a note from my publisher.
"We are returning all of the unsold copies of Faster Than
the Speed of Love."
You guys got a garage or something?
We got like 300 boxes of these things.
Wow, that's a lot of boxes!
Oh, this is so weird.
Look what they used to pack your book in.
Shredded-up pieces of your book.
Okay, that's it, I'm finished.
What are you talking about?
I'm-I'm finished.
I'm done. It's over.
Clearly, I am not meant to be a writer.
I have tried and I have tried, and nothing has worked out.
I... put my heart out there, and it keeps getting stomped on.
Well, that's it, no more.
I-I-I'm done writing.
What? Writing's the only thing that's giving your alcoholism any credibility.
Ooh, hey, you know, I just thought of something, hold on a sec.
I bought a vase last week and it's still in the box, and I just want to check to see what they used to pack it...
Ah, it's your book!
Oh, my God, this gets me so angry!
What? What is it?
Look at this.
The number-one book on The New
York Times Bestseller list is Dream Your Way to
Spiritual Joy by Pauly Shore.
This is why nobody bought my damn book.
You know, this is what they want.
The Secret.
Chicken Soup for the Soul.
The Purpose Driven Life.
I-I tell ya, I could crap one of those things out in a night.
I'm gonna tell Mom you said "crap."
No, I mean it. I could do it in three hours and idiots everywhere would buy it.
Well, why don't you? Believe me, I would love to, just to make a point, but I... I've given up writing.
Yes, but you cared about what you wrote before.
You don't care about this, so what does it matter?
Well, you do have a point.
All right. Maybe I will.
Oh, how fun. Can
I watch you write it?
I don't know, Stewie,
I kind of like to write in solitude.
No, no, I promise, I'll be as quiet as a guy in a coma.
MAN:
Ah, this is great.
I can finally be alone
with my thoughts.
Wait, I've got it.
Predator versus Batman.
Why has no one done this?
I need a pen, where's a pen?
Oh, right, I can't move.
That's okay, I'll remember it.
I mean, I can't forget a
million-dollar idea like that.
It's even better than the one
yesterday about the guys who...
Wait, I mean
the woman with the...
What was it?
Was she a shapeshifter?
Damn it, I just had it.
All right, calm down.
At least you've still
got Batman and the...
It was Batman Meets...
Oh, you got to be kidding me,
I just had it.
What was it, Batman Has a Son?
No, no, you (bleep) idiot.
No wonder your wife shot you.
And... done.
There it is, Stewie.
Three hours, 27 minutes and I've got myself one big steamin' pile of book.
You want to hear it?
Oh, definitely.
What are you calling it?
Wish It, Want It, Do It.
Love it.
Thanks. Okay.
"Chapter One: Wish it.
"What are all the things you want most in the world?
"Use the following blank pages to write down all of your dreams and desires."
Ah. Brilliant. Make them do the work.
Yeah, why not?
You know, i-i-if people want crap, I'll give 'em crap.
And, you know, I have a friend who might be able to help get this published.
Wait, you have a friend in publishing and you never told me before?
He's kind of a new friend.
Who is he?
Yeah, I don't know if you want to start digging around in this area.
Let's just leave it at he's a friend in publishing and he calls on Thursdays.
Um, hey, Brian, when you're done, can I make a pirate hat?
(sighs) Here, just take it.
I look awesome.
All right, I got to go to a wedding.
I'll see you later.
Oh, my God, that is fantastic news!
I can't wait to tell him!
I know, I told you the book was good.
Yeah, thank you so much, Don.
Um... red overalls, a yellow shirt underneath-- um, I-I-I don't really have time to do this right now.
Brian, they're publishing your book.
You're kidding.
I-I can't believe it.
That's the worst thing
I've ever written.
Not according to Penguin Publishing.
In fact, you're supposed to call the chief editor.
Penguin Publishing.
One moment, please.
Sir, I have a Brian Griffin on the line...
Out. Get out!
Get out now!
All right, everyone, I made a very special breakfast to celebrate Brian's book coming out.
And... and... it's a special breakfast for me, too, right?
Why?
Because... because it is the anniversary of when I started to eat vegetables.
Author! Author!
And Peter for eating healthy.
Oh, Lois, you didn't have to go through all this fuss.
What you got there?
Oh, this? It's just a copy of Us magazine.
Can you believe it?
Wish it, Want it, Do it got three stars.
How... How hilarious is that?
It's not hilarious; its great, Brian.
That's a huge accomplishment.
Well, I helped get the review in.
I called a friend over at Us Weekly who usually just covers people with gross amounts of children, but now he's the book reviewer.
So hats off to both of us.
Well, n-nice going, Stewie.
You ought to be my publicist.
You know, I-I don't want you to be offering me this just because we're related.
I do have references you can call.
You know, I-I spent a month as Melanie Griffith's loose skin holder.
Melanie! Melanie!
Over here.
You look beautiful.
Can't... hold... on... much... longer... Whoa.
(à la Droopy Dog):
I should have stayed in bed.
Yeah, we're walking in now.
Make sure Tom Tucker knows he has 20 minutes and he is to only talk about the book-- no personal questions, all right?
Are you okay? You good? You...
You need anything? All right.
All right, we're inside and there is nobody here to greet us.
We have no idea where we are or where we're supposed to go.
Oh wait, is that you on the phone over there?
Is this--? This is us.
Look over here.
There we go.
He sees us. All right.
Hi, thanks for coming.
Yeah, hello, we've been here awhile.
Come on, I'll show you the green room.
And Mr. Griffin, I just have to say, I loved your book.
Oh, well, thanks.
What's your name?
Sharhooz.
Oh, my God.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Oh, uh, excuse me, there's something on the wall.
Now you have exactly 20 seconds to find us a room with a white sofa, a white table, white hydrangeas and Fiji water!
Geez, Stewie, there's no need to--
Ooh, I said no gray M & M's.
These are all gray.
Don't worry, Brian.
I've got it all under control.
You're a big canine star.
They should be treating you like Spuds MacKenzie.
Man, I wonder what he's doing now.
Now, ladies, approach him slowly.
He can't really see anymore.
I've injected him with the Viagra.
Now, I'm gonna roll him on his back, but you're pretty much gonna have to do 100% of the work.
We're here with Brian Griffin, local author of the new bestseller
Wish it, Want it, Do it.
Am I pronouncing that correctly?
Uh, yeah.
N-Now, what does that mean--
Wish It, Want It, Do It?
Uh, well, it... it basically just refers to the steps necessary for identifying and achieving your dreams and doing so in as effective and expeditious a manner as possible.
Wow. And it's nonfiction, right?
Y... uh... yes, it is.
Now, w-which one is that? I always forget.
Is that the one that really happened or not?
Uh... yeah.
Okay, oh, so this... so now... so this is... this is a true story.
Well, it's not really a narrative--
Doesn't matter. I'm hooked.
And we'll be right back with sports.
Okay, you're doing great so far.
Now I was just texting with New York.
We're doing a whole thing there.
I booked your plane ticket, and I specifically asked that you not sit next to an Asian.
Stewie, that's racist.
That's terrible.
I'm sorry, do you want me to call back and change it?
Well, it's done now.
Seems like a lot of extra work.
Okay, there's a book signing at the Barnes and Noble on Union Square at 5:00.
And then at 7:00 you're meeting with a reporter from In Style magazine at Pastis.
I just wanna warn you, she's very heavy.
So be prepared for that.
Geez, how heavy?
I don't know, but apparently heavy enough that they felt they needed to warn me.
Oh, look at this, your book is number three on Amazon.
Number three?
Well, who's number one?
Oh, it's that new biography on Michael Jackson.
Oh, come on, another one?
Unless it was written by a ten-year-old's bottom, who cares?
I... it doesn't say who the author is, Brian, but I... I would guess that it's probably not that.
Well, Stewie,
I can't tell you how much I appreciate all you're doing.
I mean, I-I have been so happy with most everything.
Oh... y... Most?
Oh, yeah... Oh, don't even, it's so tiny, those other things, it's not even worth...
Oh, my God, you're amazing.
I've been so thrilled with how you're doing.
Oh, great.
Hi, can I help you?
Yeah, uh... Checking in.
Brian Griffin.
You... You should usually do that.
That... You should check me in.
That's like one of the things I was talking about.
I just have to tell you,
I loved your book, Mr. Griffin.
Oh, thank you so much.
You made my day.
So, you still in school?
Graduating this year.
Well, we'll have to celebrate while I'm here.
(giggles) Okay, well, I'll be right back with your key.
She's so pretty, isn't she?
Yeah... you know.
Do you think she liked me?
I don't know.
How... How weird would it be if she just showed up at my room later?
I... Pretty weird, I guess.
Oh, my God, were you... were you thinking of doing that?
Sending her to my room?
No... why?
Why? Were you thinking of me doing that?
I don't even know what you're saying anymore, man.
Just... do... do whatever you're thinking.
Oh, man, crazy.
Hi, um, I just want to say that I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.
Uh-huh. What's your name?
It's Jan.
Okay, here you go, Dan.
Y-Yeah, it's Jan.
Back of the line. Go on.
Come back around, he'll try it again.
Hi. Can you make it out to Kelly?
Well, hi there. I sure can.
You know, I have to tell you,
Wish It, Want It, Do It totally changed my life.
Well, you know, that's what I set out to do with this book, so, you know, I gotta tell you, that makes me feel pretty great.
This is just a phone number.
I know, I know, my phone number.
Oh.
Yeah.
What do you think of that?
Um, I'm not sure.
Well, you know,
I'm sure for you.
Oh.
Yeah.
I see.
Yeah.
I'm a little creeped out.
Hey, congratulations, somebody famous now hates you.
Okay, so, that's enough autographs, I think.
Listen, I want to thank you all for coming down.
And remember, Wish It,
Want It, Buy It. All right.
Brian, settle down.
You're worse than that guy from Penguin Publishing.
You want to get a book published, don't you?
Well... yes.
Well, if you want to be in black and white, black and white's gotta be in you.
God, you know,
Stewie, I-I used to think that John Lennon was kind of a jerk for saying The Beatles were bigger than Jesus, but now, I mean, it's like,
I'm not saying I am, but I get it.
You know, now that we have two minutes to kinda let the dust settle,
I just wanna say that I'm really proud of you.
Hey, I'm proud of myself, man.
I mean, I think it's like... you know,
I-I think everybody has greatness in them, but it's-it's really about having the courage to just kinda get inside your own head and just kinda poke around in there, you know, be, like,
"Hey, oh, my gosh, what's under here?
"Hey, what do you call yourself?
"Oh, Wisdom.
"Oh, Profundity.
"Oh, Truth.
"Hey, let's, let's all just go hang out together between the covers of a book."
I love hearing about your process.
Hey, enough about me.
This was a great meal.
Oh, good, good,
I'm glad you like it.
They told me everybody comes here.
Hey, there's
Renee Zellweger.
Hey, Renee, how you doin'?
Oh, hi, Brian!
She seemed really nice.
Get over here!
Is, is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
Can you figure out what the problem is?
I-I don't...
I-I honestly have no...
Oh, God!
How do you think I feel walking out of the back room of a restaurant and seeing
Renee Zellweger eating in the front room of that restaurant?
I am mortified.
Absolutely mortified!
You should know better than this!
I-I told them who you were when I made the reservation!
Look, I have written a best-selling phenomenon!
I should be sitting in the front damn room!!
Okay, okay, I hear you, I hear you.
And I just want you to know that my only goal is to be able to help you better.
And you being honest with me, well, that's helping me do that.
So thank you.
Good.
Oh, Brian, are you going straight back to the hotel?
'Cause I was gonna go back...
You know what, I'll just...
I'll take a cab.
Oh.
Well, at least it's not raining.
Hey, Brian, welcome home!
How was your book signing?
Geez, Lois, could I have, like, five minutes to decompress, please?
It was a really horrible flight, and I was sitting next to a
Japanese guy who had a cold.
STEWIE: Dear God,
he's become a monster!
BRIAN: Stewie, I got a flea thing goin' on in here!
Where the hell's my Frontline?!
Oh, my God! Brian! Brian!
Brian, look at this!
I got you on
Real Time with Bill Maher!
You're kidding?
That's awesome, Stewie!
Great job!
Oh, "great job," so you know that phrase.
What's that?
What?
What phrase do I know?
Bill Maher, whoo!
Okay, so the topic is going to be,
"Should God play a role in politics?"
Oh, and here's your heartworm pill wrapped in bologna.
Stewie, the point of the bologna is that I don't know the pill is there.
Why am I standing under an air vent?!
Um... because... because that's where...
Because that's where...
I...
I...
Because...
Because...
Well...
Well...
I can...
I can...
Uh...
Uh..
You...
Yeah...
Uh... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.
Okay, Mr. Griffin, we'll be ready in five minutes.
You'll be on the panel with Arianna
Huffington and Dana Gould.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
My-my publicist told me
Christopher Hitchens would be on the panel.
No, we told him Dana and Arianna two hours ago.
I did my prep research on
Christopher Hitchens.
I am so... sorry.
I am done with you.
Do you hear me?! Done!
Get out of here now!
Brian, please.
You're fired!
Yes, but I think the more important question that sometimes gets ignored is what about the separation of church and state?
Well, Bill, see, I think...
Uh-uh-uh, actually, Dana, if I may, if I may,
I have some insight on this.
Bill, do you mind?
Go, dog.
Well, it just so happens that separation of church and state is something
I'm actually gonna cover in my next book,
God. Period. Dammit.
What does that mean?
Uh, well, if I can expand on this.
Um, for one thing,
"In God we trust" is on money.
Now, what does that tell ya?
Tells me Americans will get all Christ-y about any sort of stupid (bleep).
So what?
I think what's actually alarming is the fact that all this kind of pseudo spirituality is being peddled to the American people in books that have, really, less substance than an issue of TV Guide.
That's a good argument.
It's a very good argument.
I agree. I agree.
Really? Because I read
Wish It, Want It, Do It.
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed!
Uh, gosh, next thing you know, both of you guys are gonna tell me that it changed your lives.
Uh, yeah, I,
I didn't read it.
Oh, hey, oh, so you're the guy.
It's-It's actually... it's actually very popular.
Well, it may be popular, but I, I have to say
I agree with Arianna.
Uh, I think it's actually quite harmful.
Oh. Did you...?
When, when did you say that?
I just did.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, maybe, maybe 'cause it sounds like you're talking with a mouthful of syrup,
I just didn't get it.
Hey, (bleep) you, man.
Actually, it, it,
I mean, it seems that these sorts of books tend to pander to the laziest kind of self-help within the narrowest socioeconomic range.
I mean, yeah, you u can wish it, and you can do it, but only if you have the educational advantages, the societal advantages that, like, what, five per cent of the country has.
Well, yeah, you forgot "want it," which is such a big part of the book. I mean, but, but you know, then again, you just said you haven't read it, so, you know...
Actually, since I said that, I did read it.
And that's another thing,
I have to say aren't "wish it" and "want it" really the same thing?
I mean, your book... basically makes three points, and two of them are the same point.
Well, you know, I mean, it does seem to be helping a lot of people, Bill...
Well, "help" is a strong word.
Um, how does this help people, like, with cancer or in Darfur?
Well, I mean, it's not really for them.
It's for, like, if you want a car.
How-how does this help you get a car?
Well, I mean, it doesn't with that attitude.
I mean, you have...
You have to do some of the work yourself.
That's why there are
50 blank pages.
That's why I keep it by the phone.
I think what this is is simple exploitation of the American people who could be using the money that they spend to buy this book to actually buy something useful like legitimate healthcare that they actually need.
You know, what-what the hell's your problem, Zsa Zsa?
What is your problem, Snoopy?
Look, what it comes down to is that these false promises of, like, a quick fix to any and every problem that you would ever have, what books like these suggest is actually damaging to a large, gullible segment of the population.
Oh, yeah, aren't you a sitcom writer?
I'm an author. I have contributed to the zeitgeist.
Do you even know what "zeitgeist" means?
If I didn't know what it meant,
I wouldn't use it, Dana-- which... which is a girl's name-- and I'm...
And you know,
I-I'm not gonna give you, I'm not gonna give you the definition right now just for your satisfaction.
You know, Brian, I don't think you're in a position, really, here to pull rank on anybody.
I mean, yes, Dana has made a career in comedy.
I don't think he's ever done anything as laughable as this book.
Look, all right, well...
What do you want?
I wrote it in a day.
Listen, Bill, I am such a big fan of yours.
I think you're totally getting the wrong impression of me.
I-I was just trying to write something that would sell.
I-I think it's crap, too.
Wow. If I had even one shred of respect for you before this, it's gone now.
I mean, if you're gonna dump on people, the kind of steaming, stinking, smelly dump that your kind traffics in...
...at least stand by your dump.
O-okay, look,
I'm happy to do that.
I-I-I'm just, I'm just try...
Look, what I was saying...
Look, just tell me what you want me to say!
Bill, he's urinating!
That's it!
Look, Bill, can I just...?
Outside.
No, no, no, outside!
Outside now!
Outside!
You get outside!
Uh, knock-knock.
Hey, Stewie.
What do you want?
I just wanna talk to you about everything that happened.
Um, you know, you were the only person who believed in me when I was down.
This all happened so fast, and I lost sight of who I was.
I mean, you know, sure, you were in a little over your head, but...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I was in over my head?
Yeah, but, Stewie, this isn't about all the things you did wrong.
It's about me apologizing.
Okay, then apologize.
I just did.
No, you didn't.
You just said it's about me apologizing.
That's not actually apologizing.
All right, Stewie,
I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable and put you in a situation that you clearly couldn't handle.
Okay, okay, there it is again.
What the hell?
Stop with that!
Y-you're right.
You're right.
This is, this is about healing.
This, this is not about how many things you messed up along the way.
It's about how badly
I reacted to them.
So, I'm sorry about how badly I reacted to your many errors.
That's as good as it's gonna get, isn't it?
Pretty much.
You can't write.

Camp Hope
Holy Mother, the soul of my father rest gives Romeo Garbollato.
May the tortures of purgatory spared him ... and must be received in the bosom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
Amen.
- Amen.
Praise the Lord.
Are your things packed up, boy?
- I have your asthma medication.
Yes, I'm almost done.
- Is grandpa in heaven now?
I hope so, sweetheart.
But, every day ... we should count our blessings and say our prayers ... so he can leave purgatory and can go to Heaven.
What is purgatory?
- Tell your sister what purgatory is.
Purgatory is a place where those suffering that sinful dead.
Or who have not atoned for their actions.
I do not understand what he just said.
Thank you, dear.
Neither do I.
Purgatory is like prison.
A place where you go to cleanse his soul ... so we are ready to meet God.
I also have to purgatory?
- Everyone goes there.
No, honey, you're a good girl.
You are God's girl.
In the world outside people want take away from you.
Your right to go to heaven.
Therefore, every day kneel ...
Tommy goes to hell.
- Rose, that's not nice.
It's true. If he needs me to fit if you were to meet ...
I asked him to bed so
He can talk with his girlfriend.
And the community says it's a sin to have a girlfriend.
He does, I swear.
- Shut up, Rose.
Do not say 'shut up' to your sister.
And no cursing, young lady.
It's no sin to a friend to have.
Your brother is just too young.
When can I go to camp?
- If you're older, but now to bed.
I have yet to pack.
I hate you.
Hello, Father Phineas McAllister,
I come to see Daniel Jacobs.
Yes, Father.
Father McAllister is here, for his appointment with Daniel Jacobs.
 Department of Psychiatry
Unit 3 </ i>
Hello, Daniel.
How did it go this week?
Have you eaten?
Daniel?
You can not hide forever for me.
It is now more than six months.
Daniel?
Can you hear me, son?
The next two weeks I am gone.
I go to camp with the kids of the community.
Daniel? May I see?
May I see your book?
Please?
Daniel, listen to me.
There is hope.
I told you several times offered.
Take help of which you are.
I'm doomed, Father.
And you, my priest, have failed.
As you have always failed.
No.
- Yes, you have failed.
You have failed.
You leave no impressions on the world, only scars.
You have failed yourself and your sister betrayed because you do not trust in God.
Are you happy with your life, Father?
Are you proud of your achievements?
I am a servant of the Lord.
Nothing happens on earth without
God's permission?
Nothing.
I hate God.
That you should also.
I read the Old Testament, the book of Tobias.
The devil, Asmodeus, seven killed men's intervention before God ... archangel Rafael and sends Asmodues stop.
Seven men.
That is the will of God.
There is no hope.
There is only the will of God.
Daniel, please.
Your time is over.
And you will see me, after today, no more.
That is the will of God.
It is God's will.
Goodbye, Father.
Daniel?
Did you this, folks?
These extremist, Islamic fascists ...
Using children as a distraction ... to pass military checkpoints light, and then their car bombs.
These are the kind of animals we face.
And it gets worse every day.
Do not ask me, just look ...
Thank you.
Go to hell.
God is a loser.
Welcome
Camp Hope
Okay, we're there.
Come here, I will pray for you.
Jesus, You are our hope.
Please find your way to the heart my son.
Make a man of him, a fighter for your Kingdom.
Keep the Devil and all his demons far away from him ... and protect it for sin of meat.
We ask all this in Your name.
- And, please, Dad, watch over him.
I'll give it to the nurse.
You do not go to jail.
What's going on?
It goes well.
- Just try to have fun.
It is simply camp.
Concentration camp.
They still have the camp party, right?
Maybe one can dance with Melissa.
I love you.
Hello Brother Jack.
John.
Hey, brother, how are you?
It goes well.
How are you, John?
- I've lost all my clients ... tell your friends about us.
- I'm sorry for you.
Thank you, Dad.
Behave you.
-Be good, boys.
We love you, sweetheart.
I'll sit back saddled
Jimmy.
Is that a problem, brother?
It looks as though we bunk areas, Tommy.
There would appear so.
Hallelujah, brother.
- Hallelujah.
Welcome again to serve one year and learning at Camp Hope.
I'm Christian Bonderman,
I am your pastoral service.
Some of you know me already, as a youth leader from home.
Everyone here has high school completed.
Everyone has done volunteer work for young adults.
We all know the rules that we should stick ... but just to be sure.
Signs or symbols of youth culture are not allowed.
Rock music is not allowed, nothing that looks like.
No magazines that are related with youth culture.
Your cell phones, better known hell if phones are strictly prohibited.
When I hear such a popular ring-tone,
I turn your neck.
There are no special boy-girl relationships allowed.
No one-on-one time with someone the female sex, ever.
And you wear a pair of trousers, at any time.
Except during ... swimming, then neat swimwear allowed.
The girls do not worry, be to do the same.
They should wear dresses at all times.
And finally, leave the camp is strictly prohibited.
Violation of these rules leads to expansion of this camp.
Is that clear?
Yes, no food, no fun, no girls.
I get it.
I'm here to help.
And if you live according to those rules ... in the time you're here, bring your closer to the Lord Jesus.
Say Amen.
- Jack ...
To begin with I,
Check all your stuff ... to ensure that we all same thing.
Unity, brothers.
Open your bags and keep them ready for inspection.
James, we start with you.
What do you have on you?
Just off this road.
What have we here?
Let's see.
Why do you need it?
You do not even shave.
It's ...
Wait a minute ...
What is this?
The Haribo factory.
That's nice.
This is not a good start.
- I sometimes get hungry.
Jesus got hungry in the desert, for 40 days and 40 nights.
I'm disappointed. - Sorry.
- I am also sorry for you.
Tommy, what about here?
You read this? From yourself?
- Yes.
That's great. Very good, Tommy.
You would also have to read Dante.
Jack, how about you?
What is this?
- No Spawn nine. Very good.
Look at this.
- It's Angela. Very tasty.
I can not let this hold.
This is a sinful place.
I take this space.
- No, you can not make.
You know what else I can do?
This.
What are you doing?
Are you going to test me?
Pick it up and pray for God's grace.
Pick it up.
Christian, my things are here, if you want to take a look.
Sit down, my brothers and sisters.
This is the day.
Which we are at war, brothers and sisters.
At war with the world.
At war with the body.
And at war with the Devil,
Satan and his dominion.
From all indications show that the end of the day is near.
And make no mistake, the Devil is real.
And what is worse, he knows he lost.
So if a cornered, wounded animal ... will increase and possible strike of you grabbing ... before descending into the pit of fire, forever.
The beast moves.
And what do we know about Satan and his demons?
He rules the world with all its much better than we know.
So he'll imagination against you.
And he'll like that against you.
He will proudly use to trick you and your sharing.
And why are we so blessed, brothers and sisters ... to be here in this camp, at this time, this moment.
The Kingdom of Heaven is yours, if you seize the opportunity.
Do you think not, you are incredible torture your destiny, for all eternity.
Jesus gives us no choice.
So, rise up brothers and sisters.
Arise children of God and take what He offers you.
Help me, Jesus, protect me.
Protect me.
Jesus, protect me.
Protect yourself ...
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen.
Breakfast, morning at seven o'clock, exactly.
Brothers and sisters, go in peace.
You okay?
- Yes.
Has Tommy back candy from the liquor cabinet?
You said that time had been.
Are you okay?
- Yes, why?
I do not know, it looked fierce from net. I was worried about you.
Yes, it was strange.
It's good now.
- You are fortunately not injured.
We need to clean chairs, not socializing with the sisters.
Jimmy, it's good.
- He has an attack.
Jimmy, is this a joke?
Open his mouth.
- Somebody get Christian.
From what the guys tell me ... it was probably a slight clonic seizure.
What is that?
An attack, caused by sudden light and a startle response.
Apparently they wanted a joke with him prosecuting.
We contact with his parents to to see if he already had ... and we take him to the hospital,
Just to be sure.
I'm sorry Jimmy, that I had never imagined.
I'm sorry. It was very stupid of me,
I just wanted to scare him.
You should know better, Tim.
Remember next time to ensure for your brother.
Yes, of course.
Father?
- Yes, Thomas, what can I do for you?
I was hoping we could talk, I have ...
We have time, I seek you on.
Yes, sir. Thanks.
Brothers,
I have our schedule for today.
Immediately after the morning prayer, we divide us into groups.
The distribution is done based of you sleeping.
And after lunch we have recreation time.
The game today 'Stratego Alive'.
Thus, group A
Timothy, Jack, Thomas and Jimmy.
We gather as a group, at the baseball field.
And because Jack thought a sarcasm good way ... the kitchen crew to thank for breakfast this morning ... do you have maid service this evening.
The sin of one affects many.
- The sin of one.
Does anyone have anything that he wants to share?
What about your vows, this summer?
What? Do you have enough time to make them all to discuss?
I have a confession,
I've broken a vow.
I found a CD, a rock album.
I do not know why, but I
Listened to 100 times.
Did you still have it?
- No, I'm wasted.
I noticed the effect on my mind.
- Good.
It is good that you recognize that rock music you can influence.
I mean, before I found the Lord and came to this community ... rock music is me along dangerous roads.
It started with going to concerts ... those concerts were drugs and alcohol.
And people who had sex, without being married.
He wanted that fixed too.
- What did you say?
Nothing.
- I have a question for you.
I understand why your comic
I torn?
Frankly no, but you established a very good explanation.
Is it not clear to you that this comic a part of youth culture?
And it contributes nothing to with to get closer to the Lord.
No, but even if it is ... gives you no right to my personal belongings destroyed.
Jack, if you give in to the temptations of this world ... makes it easier for Satan to find a weakness, a vice ... and then he crushed you.
Why has so much power?
Who gave him that power? God?
- Of course not.
Why does God allow Satan to exist?
Why does He allow us to risk?
Why, if he loves us?
It is because of us. Our sin.
The sin of Adam and Eve.
We have given power to Satan.
It is because of us.
My deceased grandfather last month.
- I know. I'm sorry.
It does not matter.
I just want to know where he is now.
Is he in hell?
He dies?
We suffer in purgatory so we are cleansed of our sins.
Before he died, he told me way to go here ... away from the community, as fast as I could.
He loved me.
Perhaps we should call with your parents there, after this camp.
What he, Christian.
What do you do in this forest?
My name is not a Christian,
I am of the camp.
Yes? The Christian camp?
What's going on?
Take care, Christian.
And remember to whom this forest.
Inbreeding acorns.
- Jack, your language, please.
Tommy, let's hang the flag back.
Well you have one.
Even Judas was popular for a while.
I have joy in my heart.
Where?
- In my heart, in my heart.
Good work. Really.
- How you doing, guys?
Christian, how likely is that we allowed to park in that city?
Zero point zero.
I like corn on the cob good.
It's been years since I went to an amusement park have been.
You hear that, Christian?
Tommy has not been there for years.
The last time was with my grandfather.
- His dead grandfather, Christian.
It's pretty funny because he always said tell my parents we went to mass.
But then we went to Coney Island.
And they still do not know.
Is this the same grandma that you said here far as possible to stay away?
I understand now what impact
He had on your life.
Stop, it goes too far.
- Should it be encouraged? Shame?
I did not say it, it is his grandfather, have a little compassion.
Why are you so negative, Jack?
Maybe
I know what your father's bitter new psyche.
It's not just my father.
All the leaders agreed.
And not just here.
Communities around the world adapt to the new rule.
That is best for the community.
-But misery for us.
Jack, it's ...
- Look over there.
The statue was moved.
The first was to the right.
Scary things are happening here.
Let's go.
The last wish of an important figure is difficult to overcome.
We need guys like Thomas.
We can not let him go.
Protect your.
This happened when my grandmother was with us.
My father's mother.
She was dying.
She had Alzheimer's.
My father spent every night at her rosaries and prayed.
She then became worse,
They spat and cursed.
Such things.
One night he took holy water to sprinkle on her.
Just when he wanted to do ... the phone rang.
He recorded and heard a voice he did not recognize.
It was the voice of a child.
High-pitched, excited.
As if marbles were in his mouth.
And the voice said:
Leave her alone!
My father asked who
I spoke.
There was only one grudgingly sound.
And the voice became even more excited.
She said: "We warn you.
Leave her alone. "
My father hung up the phone.
He blessed the room with holy water.
He sat down and began a Rosary.
And when he did this the phone rang.
I let it ring.
It rang and rang ... until I became frustrated and threw the phone against the wall.
And then it was paused.
And he sat down.
And once he made the sign of a cross ... the phone rang.
I was in my life has never been so scared.
It happened every night.
My father disconnected all phones
Before entering her room.
And once he made the sign of the cross ... the phones were ringing.
All of them.
This went on until she died.
I have felt them earlier.
What?
Brothers, time to get up and serve the Lord.
Let's do it, guys.
The Lord must be served.
I'm excited.
Come, Holy Spirit
Blessed Creator and in our hearts ...
Take all of your retirement
Come with your grace
Heavenly and air ... our hearts heal that you have made our hearts heal that you have made
Brethren, I can not do enough stress.
If your sexuality is not subject the will of God ... can and will be your downfall.
It starts with your imagination ... fantasies that ultimately lead to masturbation.
For you to completely dominate resulting in sexual perversity.
These are serious, reprehensible sins.
You're not welcome
In the Kingdom of Heaven ... if you masturbate, even if only once, without to confess.
Or if you intimate caresses with a sister ... or a brother.
If you're an orgasm is the same as sex before marriage.
Stay on your guard.
Stay chaste.
Your very souls are at stake.
Hi, how are you?
Let us thank God for this delicious meal ... prepared with love.
Give each other hand.
Dear God, thank You for this meal is here.
Thank you for the person who prepared for us.
Bless them for selfless sacrifice they make.
And bless this congregation, this community ...
Now as we celebrate your goodness.
Amen.
Amen.
Father, I ...
- You wanted to see me.
Yes, I wanted to talk ...
Come to the chapel after dinner.
Thomas ...
Come inside.
This is the cup of my blood.
This cup was a gift.
The thirteenth birthday of my initiation.
Come on, hold it.
Stick with it.
It is the divinity.
In your hands hold up the holder of the divine.
The blood of our Lord.
And the altar, God is here manifested.
His flesh, His blood.
Through me, His priest.
It's pretty intense.
- It's a well-chosen word. Intense.
A good word.
How does it feel?
In order to consecrate the Eucharist?
It feels like when shared a secret with you.
A glimpse of the sublime.
Something that we do not fully understand ... but we know that it's bigger than us.
Humbled to be part this piece of magic ... this mystery.
Every day when I do my part in the consecration of the Eucharist ... is new.
Like the first kiss of a couple.
This is the miracle of the priesthood.
It's a wonderful life, Thomas.
Have you ever thought?
- I?
No, I do not think me that she would be admitted.
What is it, Thomas?
You'll think I'm crazy.
- I think not.
I have these dreams ... actually nightmares.
It's like I'm being ... a demon.
This is in your dreams, you say?
But when I wake it's still just me.
It's like my sense loss, Father.
I know of cases of demonic possession.
It's rare but it happens, and it can be frightening.
If this happens again, you come to me immediately.
No matter what time it is, you understand?
Yes, Father.
Bend your head.
Come on, let those two beat.
Do more.
Come, walk like you mean it.
And then, what then?
That's it, come on.
Here.
Come on.
Everything okay?
- Your turn.
It hurts.
I go to the infirmary.
Do you want me to go with you?
- No, I got it.
I go for it, Jimmy.
You can get a little rest.
Here you can be a little sleepy.
But the dance is tonight.
You will be there.
Rest now first.
Lord Jesus, bless this child.
Heal him, Lord.
Welcome to the dance.
Brothers and sisters, tonight will you are so happy because ...
Tonight we
The folk dance.
Shortest to longest. We put David's here, and Goliath's there.
Jack, put your shirt into your pants.
Jack, come on.
This will be great.
Where's Tommy?
He came to the ward.
Folk dance evening.
Smile.
Do you like the Folk?
I know you love.
Tommy ...
Give everything!
Where were you?
I had another asthma attack and I fell asleep.
Is it going?
I missed you.
It looks like you have a good time.
I would do anything for me you have fun.
Lets make a deal.
Tonight.
How?
Come to me.
Jack lets your alibi.
Are you crazy? You know what happens when we are caught?
I know.
I do not care.
I want to see.
Come to me.
Okay, at half past eleven.
See you at the stables.
What are you doing here in the dark?
We were talking.
He was sick and ...
Just go back to your cabin.
You're acting like a tramp.
Excuse me?
- A whore.
You're acting like a whore here in the pitch dark, with a young man.
People will think you
're a whore.
Good night, Melissa.
I am extremely disappointed in you, Thomas.
I thought I would not make it.
A few judges were on the balcony and blocked the road.
I thought the horses would betray me.
Where's Tommy?
I think the nurse.
Have asthma, you know.
FYI, Jesus is your savior, not your friend.
Funny. How would the Inquisition you, Christian?
My father told your parents about thought of leaving this place.
Is it true?
How do these rumors as soon as the round?
Oddly, this community, with all her dedication, gossips more ... than people in a supermarket.
So it is true?
Yes, I mean, they just think about it.
Let's sit down.
But why?
Nobody knows this but,
My father is in the AA.
Really?
Before his conversion
He was a real alcoholic.
My parents were so almost divorced.
I did not, sorry.
With this new rule they've ordered not to go ... and my mom would not.
But if you leave ...
- I know how it is when someone leaves.
How they are treated.
It means that my parents lost in this world.
The flesh and the devil.
And how will their slutty daughter perish?
I can not believe he called you so.
Neither do I.
Why did you say anything then?
By Father Phineas?
Are you crazy?
No, not if you believe that he was wrong.
It was so wrong to me so to speak.
I know, I had something to say.
Sorry, Mel.
Remember how much fun it was?
When we were kids?
There were prayer meetings, followed by picnics that lasted and lasted.
We had so much fun.
It was fantastic.
I met you for the first time in such a picnic.
You were eight or nine years.
Something?
Yes, I think eight.
You were so cute.
You always had such an effect on me.
Oh God, Mel.
Oh God, Mel.
Tommy ...
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Father miserable ...
You failed.
As you've always failed.
Time's up.
God is with me.
I can not believe this happened.
Neither do I.
Are you ...
What?
Sticky.
We have this summer barely touched each other.
It was intense.
Did you hear that?
- Yes.
We can not caught in this way.
Stay here, stay.
I can not believe we just did.
Say this to anyone.
Tommy, I have no regrets.
Please, do not it feels bad.
I give a lot to you.
I will not tell anyone.
I can not even imagine
I would say to them.
I'll wait here a few minutes and then I follow you.
I do not want them coming home to see us together.
That is a bad girl.
That is a bad girl.
That is a bad girl.
Why are not you with your campers?
Because someone is missing.
Who?
Thomas Leary.
- Come on.
This is the path.
This is the path.
Sister, what happens?
I get nothing but tatters.
They have the same nightmare.
- Father, what happened?
Sisters, keep the peace.
Be calm, nothing will happen.
Father, protect these Sisters.
Take all the bad thoughts away.
All fear of the enemy.
Melissa, why are you still dressed?
Tommy?
Tommy?
Tommy, stop.
- Stay here.
My God.
Okay?
The inhaler.
- Where is he?
In the infirmary.
- I'll get him.
Carol, is he okay?
He is better. He was afraid.
Asthma can be very frightening.
Yes, it is.
I must see him.
Sure, but he is very weak and can not speak.
The drugs must do their job.
Can not this wait until tomorrow?
I do not see why not.
Thanks for your help tonight.
God bless you.
I will stay here with him and go pray for him.
Then I'm gone.
Good night.
Good night, Father.
Do not speak, Thomas.
If you're better tomorrow we should talk.
I know you're not responsible are for the desecration of the chapel ... but there are certain things happened tonight.
You know what I speak.
You will tell me.
Got it?
This is my body that you will be sacrificed.
He took the cup, saying 'Thank You'.
He handed the cup to his disciples and said ...
This is the cup of my blood.
The blood of the New and everlasting covenant.
Do this in memory of me.
This is Melissa. I received it via one of the girls from her cabin.
Gotta go, the mass begins.
Are you okay? What happened?
Everything is fine.
I'm going to shower.
We'll talk later on.
Yes, I'll tell it later.
Can I read?
- No.
Goodbye.
Tommy, if you're ready ... and if you can, come back to me.
What were you doing outside your cabin tonight?
- I was sick, I had asthma.
I know but there was a girl not in her cabin last night.
Were you with her?
Who?
- Do not play games with me.
I do not know what you have it, Father.
All right.
What were you doing in the chapel tonight?
I saw it, Father.
- What did you see?
The demon.
When did you first felt?
I do not know, it started after my grandfather died.
Is this the grandfather you brought to amusement parks ... instead of going to church?
Yes.
Were you good friends?
- Very good friends.
My condolences at the loss.
Am I crazy, Father?
I've seen this before.
And what happened to him?
Where is he?
He stays in a mental institution.
He tried to commit suicide and his sister to murder.
Why would God allow this?
God can not be questioned our weak minds.
And this is God's will?
Nothing on this earth is done without
God's permission.
He tests us within our own borders.
He gives us the resources, sacraments and the grace to fight enemies.
Because the enemy is cruel.
But you choose whether you accept what he offers.
I can help, but then
You listen and do what I say.
I do what is necessary.
Here, sit down.
- Yes.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
When was the last confession?
A few months back.
- Go on.
After my last confession, I lied.
I've lied to my parents.
- And the sins of the flesh?
Yes, Father.
I have impure thoughts.
- You masturbate?
Yes, Father.
- How often?
So every day.
I do not know.
You invite the Devil in your imagination.
Every time you masturbate you open a door.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
And Melissa?
Were you with her?
You can not honestly confess if you suppresses a sin that you know ... thus reach forgiveness.
So, were you with her?
Yes.
- This is a serious offense.
Got her a sin?
A kiss, that's all.
She is a good person.
Are you sure, others not?
Sin remains if you do not confess.
I know.
Good. If you take more punishment not participate in the camp.
The remaining time you spend here to pray and serve ... and I have to tell your parents what you did.
But as you said in this a confession ...
I must ask your permission.
Can I tell them?
- Rather not.
Thomas, none of this will easy, nothing.
You're disgusting.
Do you have any idea about the shame
You've caused me ... in my name, your mother? Well?
I'm sorry.
- That means nothing. Just empty words.
You sorry means nothing, these are empty words.
Empty words.
Listen now to the Father.
You must change, otherwise ...
Stand up for God.
Your mother wants to talk to you.
I'm here.
- What did you do?
Mom?
- Yes?
Mom, please ...
Tommy ...
- Enough.
Try not to get sympathy.
That you will not find here.
None.
You did this.
Listen to the Father.
Be a man or you will not come home.
No Hope For You
I'm so sorry.
I've got my glove needed.
- What is happening, friend?
Nothing.
Maybe I'll sneak into the park
During the stage tonight.
I love the cream waffles and they have a crazy rollercoaster.
Go you, "Padawan?
- I'm grounded.
Really? What?
I am caught.
- By Melissa?
Was Father Falic evil?
Yes, you could say.
- Damn.
It's not fair.
- What?
Only if it is against the rules.
- Calm down.
Are you okay?
Pray for me, Jack.
Can I help you, officer?
Is this one of your campers?
- Yes, what happened?
He came into contact with a pair of our local young people at the park.
A few elements of our poorer.
They've beaten him properly of what I understand.
He was lucky.
A good Samaritan intervened.
He caught some of those guys, and she quite frightened.
One of them known vandalism.
Agents are looking for the stolen stuff.
That's good news.
We made our concerns. One child his age, outside unattended.
We called his parents and who told him to bring back here.
Thank you so much.
Help me with the latter.
I'll let you go for tonight.
It'll be fine.
She put me and marked me with this clip.
- What happened?
Inbreeding which figures you encountered in the forest.
Who jumped me in the park and beat me up.
Now you know why we have rules that we use.
Those idiots had earlier problems experienced one of the brothers ...
In a restaurant one year ago.
They wait for us until we came back ... because their parents said they would go to hell.
There will be nothing much to do here.
- You should be happy ... the fact that you could sacrifice yourself for your brothers and sisters.
Are you kidding?
I do not care about them.
How can you say that?
After all we have done for you.
What have you done for me?
You turned my back on family and made my father a sort of medicine?
For years, demanded the leaders of these community, his father, my father ...
That's not fair.
- Fewer people outside the community helped.
So he had more time for the brothers and sisters.
But when you decided to go brainwash.
What are we now?
What should my family now?
Jack, you're going too far.
- Shut up, Christian!
Should I listen to you?
Are you my example?
A 23-year-old follower who does everything what he said.
You have no fucking idea of yourself.
Look at yourself, look at your nails.
Come on, show them.
You bite it like a little girl.
You allow yourself as influenced by their use ...
Chris, stop it.
Jack, stop.
What are you doing?
Okay?
Get out of here.
Go away.
You belong here.
- Since you're absolutely right.
What time is it?
- No idea, about two hours.
I'm outta here.
What? How?
My father is here, my parents ...
I think we are tired of this camp.
Really?
Shut up there.
You come through here.
Is it right?
- Yeah, right.
They can beat me down but I come just back stronger than before.
Take care of yourself.
See you on the other side.
Yes.
The world is us, use our pride, our greed ... secular humanism is his church.
And the flesh is weak for us ... lustful temptations.
But the Devil uses both our brains to attack.
The devil knows our psyche, and how it works, better than we do.
He uses the weakness of our brains, for us to drive to anger ... to fear, to despair.
John of the Cross ... was often oppressed by the Devil.
And in his dark night, he discusses the tortures of the devil.
This is what he says ...
If the spiritual communication is not fully provided to the mind ... but also on the senses ... then the easier the Devil mind disrupt and irritate ...
Terrors by the senses.
The pain and anguish it causes are enormous.
And sometimes impossible.
Since direct transfer takes place between mind and spirit ...
The evil spirit causes a horror in the right spirit ... sometimes for the good spirit intolerable.
Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us sinners ... now and in the hour of death.
Amen.
Father?
Thomas ...
I came here looking for you.
Are you free from sin?
Yes, Father.
No more masturbated?
No.
Wonderful, you are a sincere and faithful servant.
I'm proud of what you have achieved.
Thank you, sir.
Go back to the prayer,
See you later.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with You ..
You are blessed among women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Hail Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners ... now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with You .. blessed is the fruit of thy womb ...
I'll get it.
- Wait for me, Rose.
And Dr. Jack. John there.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
Hi, John.
- Patricia.
Jack, what happened to your face?
Why are not you at camp?
My son has something that you need to hear.
When Tommy first told that
I thought he was crazy.
I do not always agree with community ... but I still believe in God and the Devil.
What do you mean, Jack?
Jack, wait for me in the car,
Please.
Tommy is my best friend and
I'm really worried about him.
You must first listen to me, Michael.
I've seen this before.
Phineas is a good father and husband done a lot for the community, but ...
I fear that he is here to participate faces.
I know you have problems with the leaders at this point ...
Michael ...
- But it suggests ...
Please let him speak.
There was a boy, Daniel, an altar boy for Father Phineas.
He looked a lot like Tommy.
But the boy had problems, serious problems.
Phineas father sent him to me ... because the boy claimed he chased by a devil.
Our brains can be amazing things.
But what I saw was this guy ... it was something I never want to see.
Then I knew that the torment of Daniel ... far more psychological than anything, it had to be spiritual.
So when working with Father Phineas the spiritual part and I helped him greatly.
The way he took care of Daniel, how he focused on debt ... sin, but only gave the demon more power.
More control.
- What happened to the boy, Daniel?
Your Tommy is a good boy and he has both of you.
What happened to Daniel ...
- Just tell us.
One night, he shut himself and his little sister ... that was not older than Rose, in the bathroom of their home.
He cut her wrists and then ... their own.
And only by some miracle,
They were found on time.
That never forgive myself.
And the church?
The church could do nothing?
No ghost exorcism?
She did not.
Daniel was suppressed.
He was not possessed.
The church has very specific definitions for possession.
Certain criteria for Eviction to take place.
Daniel did not meet these criteria ...
So he was left to the care
Father of Phineas and me.
And we failed.
What does this have to do with my son,
John?
I fear that the same demon success wishes to obtain, such as Daniel ... the same strategy to for Tommy.
Father Phineas and he found an unwitting accomplice.
Open the door.
Rose.
Rose.
Honey.
What is it, honey?
It is good ...
It's OK ...
Brethren, I know that the last day, in this camp have been difficult.
It is now clear that the Evil his work is doing in our lives.
Tonight we will fight against him.
Tonight we will expel him.
Let us pray for one another.
Choose a brother and ask him to pray for you.
Lord, banish Satan the name of Jesus.
Dispel Satan in the name of Jesus.
Pray for me, Tommy.
Pray that I will be strong ... let me holy.
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.
We drive out Satan in the name of Jesus.
No, stop.
Tim, what is it?
- Make it stop. No, stop.
Timothy, what is it?
- God, what is that smell?
I saw the Devil, a demon ...
I do not know what I saw.
It was so real.
A prediction of the Lord.
Fear not my children, for I am with you.
I make sure nothing happens to you.
I love you.
But evil has no ...
What happens?
Stop.
- I hate ... you.
What was that?
What happened?
What happened?
- I do not know ...
Go to my room.
Now.
Calm down. I'll protect you.
Why did you not tell me?
Father, I lied.
You gave us all at risk.
You go with your sin, without taking account of the Devil.
But he keeps in mind.
He does.
I wanted to hurt anyone.
I blame myself.
- Confession.
What happened to you and Melissa in the woods?
You did not tell me the truth.
What happened?
Have you had sex with her?
- No, Father.
Tell me.
We gave each other an orgasm with our clothes on. That's all.
That's it?
You accept a sin in your life.
You ... devils spawn.
James teeth are broken.
Timothy is in his own feces.
Daniel is in a lunatic asylum.
And all those roads lead back to you.
Tell me now, when ...
If you had to sin in your life?
Was it your grandfather?
- No.
He put the door?
- No, he was a good man.
He gave you to the devil.
- He loved me.
I love you.
Tommy, stop.
Calm down.
Where is Father?
Where ...
It must be so.
You promised to protect me.
Protect me.
Be my servant.
Tommy ...
Help me.
A sinner.
I do not want.
Enough.
Can you hear me?
Tommy?
You hear me, Tommy?
There you are.
Where?
Do not talk.
You're in the hospital.
You had a severe asthma attack ...
We were almost lost.
Where is Father Phineas?
- He is also here.
He had a stroke, he ...
How are you?
You got me scared.
You look good.
Father is here, I found it on in the hall, he makes his rounds.
Would you thank him the blessing?
- Of course.
The body of Christ.
Tommy?
Tommy, get it, son.
- No.
Maybe I should ...
- No, Father.
Please.
Your son has been through a lot tonight.
Maybe it's better him alone order.
It's okay.
I want to anymore, Mom.
If it is really the body of Christ ... it is too much to suggest.
And if not, it's all a big lie.
I can not believe Mom.
I can not and will not.
I can go to your school, and I can follow your rules, but ...
You can not make me believe.
It's too terrible.
I need them redeemed.
My God ...
Enough.
Sweetheart ...
Enough.
We can not pull the plug.
God can heal him.
See you soon.
Based on a true story.
THE WARD (2010)
[THUNDER]
[FOOTSTEPS]
[TAPPING]
Aah!
[CRACK]
[WHISTLING]
DISPATCH: All units, be on the lookout for a missing person.
Female, late teens. About 5'6", 7.
Last seen wearing a light skirt.
She is considered unstable and possibly dangerous.
What the hell?
I think that's her.
All right, little girl.
No! Get off me!
No! No!
Get her. Get her.
No! No! No!
Sweetheart, behave.
No!
In you go.
Watch your head.
[GIRL GASPING]
- Watch your head.
- No!
Cuff her.
- Get the cuffs on her.
- No!
No! No!
No! No!
[SIRENS]
What's your name?
Kristen.
NURSE: She belongs in jail, not here.
2nd NURSE: They're taking her to the ward.
She can't hurt anyone there.
I'm Roy.
Welcome to paradise.
So, I can be your buddy or I can be a thorn in your side.
It all depends on whether you're willing to follow the rules.
This is the ward, your new home.
Okay.
Kristen, huh?
All right. Come with me.
You're free to use the recreation room and the courtyard any time
8 A.M. to 10 P.M., but at night, we're locked down and you'll be confined to your room.
This will be your room.
Get some rest.
Kristen?
Most patients prefer the bed.
I'm Dr. Gerald Stringer.
I'll be treating you while you're here.
Good morning.
How did you sleep?
Who came in here last night?
What do you mean?
Somebody came in here and hid my blanket.
The door was locked all night, wasn't it, nurse?
Yes, doctor. Always.
Here. Take these.
No.
It's not a request.
What are they?
Something to help you get better.
You're right. I feel better already.
You would do well to follow the rules around here, young lady.
That'll be all for now, Nurse Lundt.
Yes, doctor.
Why am I here?
That's the $64,000 question.
[APPLAUSE ON TELEVISION]
MAN on TV:
Are you ready?
WOMAN on TV: Are you a member of the theatrical profession?
MAN on TV: Yes.
Who is the new girl?
Some runaway.
We'll see how long this one lasts.
Who are you?
I'm no one.
Well, why are you here?
I'm not. I'm leaving.
Are you gonna save us?
From what?
[SING-SONG]
# Oo-oo-ooh #
Come on, Emily. Knock it off.
Let's not scare off the new girl on her first day.
Hi.
My name's Iris.
It's Kristen, right?
I saw your name on the door.
Looks like Iris has herself a new girlfriend.
Jealous?
Well, you still make me throw up.
[GAGGING]
Blehhhh.
You two are disgusting.
Looks like it's time to see the doctor.
Right this way.
How are you feeling?
Have you met the others yet?
Why am I here?
I'm hoping we can get to the bottom of that mystery together.
Let's discuss what happened yesterday, Kristen.
What's the first thing you remember?
Fire.
And before that?
Tell me about this farmhouse, the one you burned down.
Why do you think you went there?
You had the address for the place written on the palm of your hand.
It must have some significance.
No.
Do you think you'd been there before?
I...
I don't know.
Burning down that house won't destroy those memories.
You've got to deal with them.
Let's deal with them together, okay?
No. No.
Often, the root of a problem like this lies with an emotional trauma.
There is no emotional trauma.
How do you know?
Look, why don't you just let me go?
I'll stay out of trouble, and then you never have to think of me again.
I'm trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
Yet, here you are, confused and disturbed.
I'm not crazy.
We don't like to use that word here.
Who's we?
Your friends behind the mirror over there?
That-a-girl.
Make you feel good.
ROY: Nighty-night.
Going somewhere, darling?
- Let go of me!
- We could do this all night long.
Let go of me!
Get off me!
[THUNDER]
[FOOTSTEPS]
Got some clothes for you.
What is her story?
Oh, she's just crazy.
Like me... and you, and like all of us.
# Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy? #
Speak for yourself, lunatic.
[LOUDER] # Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy? #
Stop it.
You're gonna make my ears bleed.
[LOUDER STILL]
# Boom, boom, ain't it great... #
Ow! You bitch!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Did I hurt your little hand?
Don't! You'll get us all in trouble.
Come on now.
Don't you think that'd be fun?
If you and I went and saw a movie together, we could snuggle up real close in the dark.
Just be by ourselves.
I want to draw you.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Just... Just act natural.
Look up.
They've been here before.
Who are they?
Those are the sad people.
Always so sad.
He's a great doctor.
I overheard the staff talking about him.
Apparently the way he's dealing with us is some sort of experimental therapy.
Futuristic kind of stuff.
And what do I need to say to this guy to get out of lockdown?
I mean, you know, to get night privileges.
No one has night privileges.
I just saw this girl walking around the halls last night.
That's impossible.
And someone came into my room the other night.
# Someone came into my room #
Just ignore her.
She never makes any sense.
# Someone #
# Someone #
Listen, don't let this place get to you.
You stay locked up long enough and you start to believe that you're nuts.
[THUNDER]
[POP-ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]

# Run, baby, run #
# Run, baby, run #

# Run, baby, run #
# Oh, come back to me #

# Even though I know... #
[THUNDER]
It's okay.
I've got you.
I don't like the dark.
Bad things happen in the dark.
See, it's okay.
It's all right.
Ah!
[LAUGHS]
Did you need some help?
Just keep a lookout.
Why are they giving us all this stuff?
They don't know what they're doing.
Thorazine.
Mellaril.
Now they give us this!
[SNIFFS]
It's tasty.
Got anything for me?
You're not supposed to be in here.
Shut up.
You seem to be getting in the middle of things, new girl.
If I were you, I'd watch out.
Aah!
Aah!
What is it? What's the matter?
Something was in here.
KRISTEN: Listen to me.
Something was in there.
Something not right, not human.
It's going to be okay.
We just need to calm you down.
Please, you've got to believe me.
Please.
Wait, please.
Wait, please.
Please don't do this to me.
Relax. It won't hurt you.
Call Dr. Stringer, please.
I'm here. I'm right here.
Please.
This is a bit.
Bite down on it or you'll bite your tongue off.
No, please.
[MUFFLED PROTESTS]
The medications aren't working as I'd hoped.
This treatment should be beneficial.
I thought they stopped using electroshock.
Just look at her.
She was all riled up before.
Now she's docile as a lamb.
Hell, I wish they'd do it to all the patients here.
Just fry the crazy right out of them.
[DOOR CLOSES AND LOCKS]
Come on, sleepyhead!
It's time to wake up.
Come on. Come on.
So, since we have a new member, let's go over the rules.
Everyone gets a chance to talk.
No interrupting.
Just say what's on your minds.
Who would like to begin?
Emily?
What did you do to Kristen?
We had to have a little unscheduled therapy last night.
Is that what you call it?
It's nothing to be alarmed about, Emily.
Sometimes when you take people away, they don't come back.
Tammy didn't come back.
Who's Tammy?
She's the last one that got out.
What did you say?
Iris, you know we don't discuss people who aren't present.
Wait, why can't we talk about Tammy?
Who's Tammy?
Zoey, how do you feel about all this?
Zoey?
Okay.
Let's discuss what happened yesterday, shall we?
In the showers?
Kristen?
Well, I didn't see a thing.
I believe her.
[SCOFFS] Great. That's someone you want on your side.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's going on in this place.
It'll be okay.
I can tell, you are strong.
See you later, alligators.
I'm off to what should be my last session with Stringer.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm being released.
That's impossible.
I've been here longer than you.
Stringer told you he was releasing you?
Not in those words, but he said I'm making great progress.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, I am.
And how did you get him to release you, though?
How did you act?
What did you say?
I didn't "act" cured, Kristen, if that's what you're getting at.
I am cured.
I'm ready.
Do you really think she's getting out of here?
[LAUGHS]
DR. STRINGER:
How have you been feeling?
Better.
I've been drawing a lot, and I'm getting along with everybody, even the new girl.
I have some of your latest work here.
Where did you get those?
You really managed to capture her essence.
I was just fooling around.
You're really quite talented, Iris.
I'm practically cured, don't you think?
That's an old one.
I'm not like that anymore. Really.
You're making considerable progress.
So I can go?
Let's see how things go today, hmm?
The others didn't believe me.
They don't think that I'm better.
Why are you doing that?
I'd like to try something a little different this time.
What is that?
It's a metronome.
[TICK-TICK TICK-TICK TICK-TICK]
Listen to the rhythm.
It will help you to relax.
Okay, close your eyes.
I haven't had any problems in a while.
I'm feeling better.
Healthier.
Focus on your home.
Imagine it.
Imagine your parents there waiting for you.
I'm starting to get sleepy.
Can you describe your home for me?
What color is your house?
We live in a little white house.
I have to... go to sleep.
It's September 3, 1958.
It's nighttime.
You are asleep in your bedroom.
She's asleep in my office.
Where did she go?
Find her.
Where are we going?
No.
No. This isn't right.
No! No! No! No!
No! No!
No, no!
Please! I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to go home.
I just want to go home!
No! Oh, my God, no! Please!
Please don't do this!
Please! Please! Don't!
No! No!
Aaaah!
It's all right.
Where's Iris?
She's not back yet?
Okay, time for bed.
Where's Iris?
Come on. Time for bed.
Go to sleep.
Anyone see Iris today?
Maybe they let her go home.
No way.
Nurse Lundt.
Please, Nurse Lundt!
Where's Iris?
If she went home, why didn't she take her sketchbook?
You can't get them to tell you anything around here.
Trust me, I've tried.
Kristen, tell me what's bothering you.
Did you treat a girl named Alice?
Where did you hear that name?
That's who attacked me in the showers.
You aren't going to answer me, are you?
What happened to Iris?
How many girls have disappeared at this hospital?
Nurse Lundt was wiping someone's name off the door when I got here.
Well, you were heavily sedated.
I'm sure you believe you saw what you say.
It happened.
What happened to them?
To whom?
To Iris. Alice. Tammy.
Are they dead?
Why would you think they're dead?
There's a ghost in here.
A ghost?
What does it look like?
A girl.
The girl that attacked me in the shower.
The one I see in the halls.
Same with the other girls.
I know they've seen her, too.
So, please... tell me what's going on here.
Please.
I can't give you the answers, Kristen.
You have to find them for yourself.
Damn it! Tell me!
Take Kristen back to her room.
You just don't give up, do you?
Let go of me!
Who's Alice?
You all know she's here, so why won't you answer me?
- Look at me!
- Sorry.
I don't converse with loonies.
Don't you ever call me that!
Don't do this.
Tell me who Alice is.
Alice Hudson was here.
She was one of us, but she's gone now.
Gone?
Where?
She got out. They let her out.
I'm getting out of here.
Tonight.
I'm gonna find Iris.
- Really?
- Really.
You can't get out.
Watch me.
- You're coming with me?
- How?
Zoey, give me your penny.
She won't let us leave.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
DR. STRINGER: Hello?
Leonard?
Yes, thanks for calling me back.
I need a consult.
Still the same lost causes, yes.
The problem is that things have begun to escalate.
All right, let's see.
We need to shove this in here like this so it seems locked, but you can still open it from the outside.
Okay.
And then you're gonna get into bed.
Make sure you have all your clothes on, but hide it with the covers.
And then I'm gonna come and get you after bed check.
Then what?
Then we get Iris and we get out of here.
Why do you care so much about Iris?
I care about getting us all out of here alive.
Open.
All right, we've got to go now.
Come on.
[DOOR OPENS]
I don't think this is the right way.
Oh, in here.
The morgue.
[DOOR OPENS]
MAN: Who turned on the lights down there?
Hide.
MAN:
Someone's been in here.
Come on, let's take a look around.
Emily?
[RATTLING, BANGING]
Emily?
Is that you?
ZOEY: Alice?
Nice try.
Kristen.
Emily.
What happened?
Those orderlies caught me, and they hurt my arms.
Did you find Iris?
No. No.
She's gone.
She's not coming back.
Look, if we don't get out of here, we're next.
We're not getting out.
We have to try again.
Nobody gets out.
Hello.
So, Roy...
Not interested.
You didn't even hear me out.
Fine. Shoot.
Well, I know you've said you wouldn't date any of us inside the ward, but I just know I'm getting out soon.
And I thought maybe you could call me sometime.
There is no way
I will ever, ever date you.
Got it?
But I know...
No! Not ever.
Now leave me alone.
I'm swamped here, and I don't have time for this.
MAN on TV: Stop it, Vi.
WOMAN on TV:
Tom Stewart killed me.
Tom Stewart killed me.
Tom Stewart killed me.
Tom Stewart killed me.
Tom Stewart killed me.
Tom Stewart killed me.
So, you and cuckoo bird have fun sneaking out last night?
[SIGHS] Go away.
You could have gotten us all in trouble.
We were looking for Iris.
And?
Couldn't find her.
Well, you probably weren't looking in the right places.
Not with Magellan over there.
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.
I saw the two of you sneaking around last night.
Shut up! They're watching.
Well, can you blame them?
Just because I was brave enough to go through with it...
Well, maybe next time, you'll do us all a favor and get it right.
Oh, boo-hoo. Timid little Zoey.
Why don't you crawl into your shell and hide, just like a little turtle?
Why don't you leave her alone?
What's the matter?
Daddy didn't pay enough attention to you?
Mind your own business.
Why don't you leave us all alone?
I mean, nobody likes you.
[GASPS]
Well, you're just jealous.
- Of what?
- Of me.
[LAUGHS]
You've been jealous of me since I got here.
I'm tired of putting up with your pathetic behavior and your ridiculous...
[TURNS UP TV]
I can't hear you!
They're all just jealous of me.
Let's see Roy say no to this.
Aah!
Aah!
No!
No! Please let me go!
Please let me out of here!
Alice, it wasn't my idea. I swear!
They made me do... aah!
No! Stop! No!
No! Please don't do this!
No! Just let me go!
Alice, no! Please don't do this!
No. Please don't do this.
No! No!
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]
Where's Sarah?
Sarah? No.
Where's Sarah?
If Alice got Sarah, she'll get us all.
No. No. No. No.
Alice Hudson.
This was hers?
I didn't touch her.
It was Sarah and the other girls.
What did you do to her?
I don't know what she's talking about.
- Yes, you do.
- Just shut up, Zoey!
This isn't a game!
What did you do to her?
Why does she want to kill us?
What did they do to her, Zoey?
[SOBBING]
Look, please, Zoey.
I need to know.
Alice was bad.
She hurt us.
She hurt us all the time.
Tammy told us what to do.
Tammy was here before you.
She said she could make it stop.
It was her idea,
So... we got rid of her.
- Alice?
- What?
I know where your bunny is.
- You found it?
- Yeah.
It's in Tammy's room.
That's mine! You can't have it!
[MUFFLED CRIES]
[MUFFLED CRIES]
[SILENCE]
We all helped, and now she's going to kill us all.
We had to.
She was horrible.
Then why is she after me?
What's it matter? We're all dead.
Emily.
- [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS]
- Emily!
Emily!
We have to get out of here. Okay?
But what about Emily?
We'll get her.
All right? Come on!
Emily, what are you doing?
I'm not strong like you.
Put the knife down.
I can't.
We're going to get out of here.
[THUNDER]
Aah!
[CHOKING ON BLOOD]
- Emily!
- [ZOEY SOBBING]
[SOBBING]
No, no, no, no, no.
This can't be happening.
Please don't let her get me.
I don't want to die.
Zoey... do you trust me?
Open the door.
Where did you get that?
Open the door now.
Calm down.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
We have an incident in progress.
Open the goddamn door!
[ZOEY WHIMPERING]
- Hey...
- Hey, back up.
- Easy.
- Back up.
Calm down.
Back up.
Go to the wall.
Back up.
Against the wall.
Come on.
Back up.
Back up! Back up!
You can't do this.
Watch me.
You're only hurting yourself.
What are you gonna do, Kristen?
Where you gonna go?
Away from here.
Come on, drop the knife.
No! No! Let me go!
You don't get it!
You don't get it!
Alice Hudson is trying to kill us!
Enough.
You can't be serious.
- No! Please!
- Kristen, Kristen.
Kristen, I need you to calm down.
That girl is a hopeless case and you know it.
Luckily, that's not your call to make.
You honestly think you can cure her?
I have to try.
Just... I need more time with her.
That's all.
You're as hopeless as she is.
You could spend a hundred years with her and she won't get...
- Ow!
- No! No!
Please don't do...
Please just listen to me.
Get her in a straitjacket and lock her in her room.
- Doctor.
- You don't understand.
[MOANS]
No.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
NURSE: You need to get some rest.
Come on.
Mm. Mm.
Down the hatch.
There.
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Sleep tight, sugar.
[SPITS, COUGHS]
Uhh!
Unh!
Sleep tight, sugar.
Where are we going?
We're getting out of here.
Open this door now!
[ZOEY SCREAMS]
Stop!
Don't close this...
Don't you close that...
Don't you close that goddamn door!
[POUNDING ON DOOR]
He's really mad.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
[ALARM BELL RINGING]
Hey! Get back here!
Uh!
ORDERLY: Wait!
We're trapped.
Maybe not. Here.
Come on. Come on!
Zoey, take this.
Okay. Come on.
All right. Come on.
Maybe this goes to the first floor, all right?
- I'll go first.
- All right. Come on.
Send it back as fast as you can, all right?
I will.
[DUMBWAITER STARTS UP]
Hey! Open this door!
Fuck.
Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Zoey?
Zoey?
Zoey?
[MENACING GRUNT]
[PANTING]
[ROARING]
[MOANING]
Aah...
[MOANING]
What's going on?
Answers.
No lies this time, or I swear to God.
Now!
The truth.
Your name... is Alice Leigh Hudson.
May I?
You were abducted from your home the night of September 3, 1958.
I'm Kristen.
Not Alice.
I'm Kristen.
You were left chained up in the basement of an abandoned farmhouse for nearly two months, the same farmhouse you burned down.
You were only 11 years old, half-starved, sick with fever, trapped in the darkness.
It was a waking nightmare.
Your only escape was into delusion.
In order to survive the trauma, your psyche fractured.
You suffer from multiple personality disorder.
Each personality took a piece of this nightmare and locked it away from you for your own protection.
But the new personalities became so dominant, they completely overwhelmed
Alice's own personality.
I know it hasn't been pleasant, but my techniques are helping you.
After several years of therapy, we've been able to isolate your different identities.
We'd just begun to single them out and eliminate them through some experimental techniques when you, Kristen, appeared.
I didn't just appear!
Your psyche invented Kristen to protect itself from having to relive this trauma.
[TICK-TICK TICK-TICK]
And now it's time to say goodbye.
Please don't kill me.
[ROARING]
Don't move. Don't move.
She's the last one who got out.
What did you say?
DR. STRINGER: Iris, you know we don't discuss people who aren't present.
She can't remember the rules.
Because she's the crazy one around here, you know.
MAN: That's enough.
Is she cured?
She'll probably need a lifetime of therapy, but she's no longer a danger to herself.
She is, essentially, your daughter again.
Can we please see her now?
MOTHER: Alice?
Honey, you okay?
We love you, sweetheart.
Mom? Dad?
Oh, honey.
I figured you'd want your things around you.
And I put this one back together for you, too.
Thank you.
I think I remember.
What do you remember?
Everything.
The old farmhouse.
This place.
The others.
Emily. Sarah. Iris.
Kristen.
You can forget all about them now.
When can I get out of here?
I really... I just want to go home.
Dr. Stringer says two, maybe three days.
I think that's enough visiting for today.
We'll let you get some rest.
Couldn't we stay just a little bit longer?
You'll have her all to yourself in no time.
[WHISTLING]
What's up, Claire?
Hey.
So this is it, huh?
Just you and me.
End of days..
Ha.
Yeah.
Uh, have you talked to Ron lately?
Ron is in Barbados snorkeling for the ever-elusive
Double Back Saddle Fish and he left explicit instructions not to be disturbed.
Yeah, well, if you owned this place you'd be off to Barbados, too.
Sure, I would. Especially if I had two saps back at home waiting to cover for me.
Oh, did you get your camera fixed?
No, it's totaled.
I have to send it back to Pana-suck-ass.
I have my microphones though, so we can make do with EVP investigations.
OK.
Oh hey, that reminds me.
I have to show you something.
So...
I was trolling around on some of the paranormal forums last night and I came across something pretty interesting.
You're definitely gonna wanna see this.
What is it?
Hold on.
Just watch...
Look closely...
I missed it the first time...
It's gonna blow your mind...
It's really heavy...
You bastard!
So good!
Oh my God.
Every time.
Oh my god.
What room did you take?
Uh...216.
Of course.
Hey, I've been here since last night.
That's just the way it goes.
225 is taken, other than that it's pretty much wide open.
Second floor only though, remember?
Third floor is already done.
Only one guest?
Brutal.
Eh, it doesn't take a genius to figure out why this place is going out of business.
Hm.
OK, I'll take room 214.
I figured we'd take seven to seven shifts.
Something like that...
Alright.
Sounds good.
I'll bring it back down.
OK, sweetie.
Come here.
OK.
OK, if I could just get you to sign that.
Here's your room key, number 224.
You wanna head up to the top of the stairs and take a right and another quick right, sorta like a dog leg.
And then you go about halfway down the hallway and it's on the right hand side.
You can't miss it.
Thank you.
Do you know who that is?
It's Leanne Reese-Jones.
OK.
She was the mom on
"Like Mother Like Son"!
Dude, she's super-famous.
OK, whatever.
Man...
Leanne Rease-Jones...
I wonder what she's doing here.
She's guest-speaking at some convention in Pottstown.
How do you know that?
She told me.
What?
What else did she tell you?
Nothing.
Why are you acting so weird?
I'm not.
Well, here's her autograph.
Just relax.
Whatever. Why are you being so grouchy today?
I'm not.
I'm just stressed.
This site is killing me.
Let me see it.
Mm...
It looks good.
I hate web design.
It looks really good.
I like the little ghosts.
It's not the most professional, but it's not bad.
There's a lot of money in this right now.
I just... I have to act fast.
Looks really good.
I like it.
And, you know, once we get some proof on there, it won't matter what it looks like.
Hey, so I was thinking.
It seems like when something really creepy happens, nobody else is around, right?
Like every time you've seen stuff, you were alone.
So...
I was just thinking that since the hotel is practically empty, we might have a chance of making some real contact.
Does that makes sense?
Yeah.
Yeah. I think this weekend's gonna be it.
We're gonna get something good.
I can feel it.
- What?
- What?
What?
What...?
Front desk.
Yes, Ms. Reese-Jones.
Oh, sure.
I'll send them right up for you.
You're welcome.
I forgot to stock the towels.
I'll get them.
Good, save me the ulcer.
That Gayle in 225 is driving me nuts and I don't want her to see me.
Oooh, that lady with the kid?
I know, what's her deal?
She was giving me total agro vibes upstairs.
She had a huge fight with her husband and she's staying here 'til Sunday with her son as payback.
She's having a very hard time and she wants him to realize how hard his life is without her.
How do you know all that?
She told me.
Why do you seem so surprised that I talk to the guests?
Um-hm
Go on, superfan.
Don't keep the talent waiting.
Miss Rease-Jones?
I have your towels...
Miss Rease-Jones?
Oh, be a lamb and hand me one of those...
Thank you.
You're welcome, Miss Rease-Jones.
Call me Lee.
Ok.
What's your name, sweetheart?
Claire
You're a life saver, Claire.
Oh, no no... I couldn't.
I couldn't
Come on. You'll hurt an old lady's feelings.
Thanks, Miss, uh, Lee.
I'm a really big fan of yours!
"Like Mother Like Son" was one of my all time favorite shows, and you were amazing in it and in 'The Waking of Eleanor...
I love that film.
Yeah, I used to watch it all the time growing up with my mom.
Leven used to put my hair in, like, little braids, like you did.
I mean, they never looked as good though.
Well, thank you.
That's very nice of you to say.
And what do you do, Claire?
I work at the front desk.
So if there's anything else that you need, just let me know.
I mean, this is our last weekend open so Luke and I are the only ones on staff today.
Yeah, we're actually sleeping here instead of going home.
It's pretty crazy.
I meant in life.
Are you an aspiring actress?
Is that what makes you such an astute fan of my work?
Me?
No... I just work at the hotel.
Oh...
But... I'm kinda like... you know..in between... stuff.
OK...
Uh, Claire...
The towels.
Right.
Of course, yes.
There you go.
How did it go?
You two gonna collaborate on something?
She kind of made me feel like an asshole.
Well, she's an actress.
What's that supposed to mean?
And what do you know about actresses anyway?
I don't know a lot, but I do know a little bit about a lot of things...
Ugh, why did she have to be such a bummer?
And why do you have to be so negative?!
I'm not negative, I'm a realist.
There's a difference.
You're pessimistic.
Pessimism is just a higher form of optimism.
If you expect nothing from people, then you go through life being pleasantly surprised.
Yeah, well, nobody loves an albatross.
I'm going to get some coffee.
You want anything?
I do not.
Fine!
Hey, how's it going?
What can I get for you?
Um... ah...
I'll tell you what.
You take your time and if you have any questions, just let me know.
Doesn't a cyclops always have one eye?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Um, I will have a large soy mocha latte with a pump of caramel.
Good choice.
So, uh, how are things going next door?
Uh... fine.
Can I speak frankly with you?
I mean, I know we don't know each other that well but
I see you all the time and we're all girls here.
This Sunday, my boyfriend is taking me on a picnic to the bay and I'm really excited.
I know it's going to be super-romantic, and I think that
I'm not letting myself be fully excited because there's something in our relationship that's been bothering me, which is that we've been together for almost a year and he still has not told me that he loves me.
And I just need to talk to somebody about it because
I don't want to ask him to tell me.
I mean, he said it on IM.
That's the thing, he said it on IM.
Which my friend says doesn't count.
It's like saying
"I love you" during sex.
It doesn't count.
And so I wonder if...
Where's your coffee?
They ran out.
Is that annoying girl still there?
Ugh. Yes.
What a fail-blog.
Epic.
Do you ever think about when you dropped out of college and wonder if you made the right choice?
Every day.
Why do people have such high expectations?
Everything happens for a reason, Claire.
Nobody just ends up at the Yankee Pedlar.
I guess.
You know what really gets me though?
Hold that thought.
My eyes feel like they've been doused in Tapatio.
I need to go upstairs.
What?
I'm sorry, I'm dead.
We can talk about your upcoming quarter-life crisis tomorrow.
I just need to tap out right now.
Fine.
Leave your computer though.
What?
I'm not gonna hack the system.
I just wanna look up a pair of high tops.
And it gets really boring when there's nobody else at the hotel.
And my book sucks.
OK.
Just be careful with it.
Duh.
Oh and if you get the itch to do any recording, the recorder is charging in the back office.
You remember how to use it you just plug the microphone into the...
I know how to do it.
I get it.
Geez. I'd hate to be a ghost in this hotel tonight.
Goodnight, Claire.
Good night, Luke.
Where is your website?
Wow, don't forget to remind him about this.
Oh.
Tragedy.
Kinda creepy.
Whoa.
Shit.
How do you work this thing?
I don't wanna scare you but
I'm standing right behind you.
Fuck!
What the fuck??
Oh my God!
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me!
- What are you doing over here anyway?
- Crap!
I thought I heard a noise, dude!
Like what?
Banging.
Like a banging, man. Ugh!
- OK, well,
- God.
I woke up and couldn't go back to sleep.
So we can switch now if you want.
Fuck!
Ok! God!
God!
Sorry.
Ugh!
Fuck!
My heart is pounding.
Do you know the story of Madeline O'Malley?
She was the woman that died here in the hotel.
She hung herself after her fiancée stood her up on their wedding day.
The original owners of the hotel thought it would be bad press and hurt the business.
So they hid her dead body in the wood cellar for three days before they could smuggle her out on the loading bay.
When the people of the town finally figured out what had happened here, they were outraged.
So the owners of the hotel had to close it down and were forced to sell it.
Nobody came through here again until the sixties.
And, ever since then, people have reported seeing the ghost of Madeline O'Malley.
Roaming the hallways, waiting for her lover.
Some say she's even looking to take up a new one.
Excuse me?
What are you doing?
Mommy!
What's going on?
She said there's a ghost in the hotel!
She says it's coming to get me!
I never said that!
What is the matter with you?
He's just a child.
Sweetie?
Sweetie.
It's OK.
It's not real.
Just a story, OK?
All right?
Come here.
I don't need this.
I have enough going on in my life.
Yes, ma'am.
You OK?
And you.
We still need towels.
I am tired of asking.
Don't make me the bad guy in this.
Right.
We're in room 225.
Yeah, I know which room you're in.
I work in the hotel.
Come on, sweetie.
It's a silly story, right?
You OK?
Ay yi yi.
Oh, I bought that cheap bread.
I can taste it.
Never skimp on bread.
You'll always regret it.
So, why do you think she sticks around here?
Beats me.
Our rates aren't that cheap.
The Courtyard by Marriot on Route 13 is much better.
No, not her.
I mean Madeline.
What do you think she wants?
I don't know.
I don't spend too much time trying to figure out what women want.
Especially dead ones.
Please...
Well, when you saw her, what did she look like?
Like, was she all dead-looking?
The thing about physical encounters is you don't really remember the details.
It's weird because you think you would but its like she was there one minute and gone the next.
It's almost like she was never even there at all.
I don't know. It's hard to explain.
You kind of just had to be there.
God, I'm so jealous.
But if I saw her
I probably would've freaked out.
I can't believe you never had your camera with you.
I know.
It kills me.
You down for some recording tonight?
Mm... definitely.
We've gotta find some proof that Madeline O'Malley exists before this place closes down.
We have to.
Imagine how she feels, being stuck here forever.
We gotta get something on tape.
It's like a moral imperative.
Eh!
Oh my God.
Ick!
Hi, Lee!
Shit!
How'd you get in there, bird?
Luke.
Luke, you are not going to believe what just happened to me.
Luke?
What?
Uh... never mind.
I'm a pumpkin.
I'm gonna kill the snake.
Don't forget to record.
I left the list for you on the desk.
OK.
Enjoy your internet porn.
This is EVP recording of the laundry room.
Luke, I'm skipping this one.
There's nothing in here.
This is the EVP recording of the banquet room.
I'm trying to contact the spirit of Madeline O'Malley.
Madeline, if you can hear me, please give us a sign.
Damnit, Luke, you said this thing would be set up.
Luke!
Luke!
Luke, Come on!
Wake up!
Come on! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
Hold it, hold it, hold it!
Luke!
Coming!
Jesus Christ.
What the eff?
Claire, I still have, like, two hours left, man!
Dude!
You have to listen to this!
The piano was playing by itself!
I think it was her!
Come on, I'll be down at seven.
I'll listen to it then.
No!
No, I'm scared!
OK, come in.
Shit.
Uh... actually...
I'm... OK...
You sure?
Yeah, I think I just freaked out for a minute but I'll...
I'll be fine.
OK.
Well, I'll be down in a few hours, alright?
OK.
Do you mind keeping it down?
Do I have to ask you again?
You know what?
Just back off, OK?!
You're asking me what I "do" the other day?
Well, I just recorded an unexplainable phenomenon!
There is a ghost in this hotel and I got it on tape and it's a big deal!
So just...
Leave me alone!
Come with me for a moment.
Here, sit.
You need a drink.
Cheers.
You alright?
Mm-hmm.
Tell me about what you saw.
I...
Look.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I have a tendency not to be a nice person.
I know that.
Please don't take it personally.
I don't apologize more than once.
Look, I can help you with what you're looking for.
I just need to know what it is that you're looking for.
I'm sorry.
Help me with... what?
Do you know what this is?
It's a pendulum.
It's used to answer life's more... difficult questions.
Do you know why I'm here?
You're speaking at an acting convention in Pottstown?
No.
I'm not here for acting.
I'm here as a guest at a healers' gathering.
That's what I do now.
It's my true calling.
Claire, everything in this world is connected.
Whether we understand that or not depends on our sense of perception, our willingness to communicate.
Now, you want to communicate with the spirits in this hotel?
I can help you do that.
I just need to know what it is that you want from them.
I don't know.
If they're real?
The... the ghosts?
Spirits.
There is no real in this world, Claire.
It's all a state of being.
There are no beginnings.
There are no ends.
There are no ghosts.
We're each divine beings that incorporate one energy in the universe.
Like, uh...
Droplets of water in a vast ocean.
The universe has a plan for each and every one of us.
Now, I want you to ignore what your conscious mind tells you.
And open yourself up, OK?
What is it that you want from these spirits?
I want to know if it was
Madeline O'Malley playing the piano downstairs.
And if she really is the spirit living in this hotel.
Hmm.
Ask again.
This time, close your eyes and really concentrate.
Open yourself up.
Really ask it.
Ask it directly.
Are you the spirit of Madeline O'Malley?
Did you die in this hotel?
Was that you playing the piano?
They won't say who they are.
They?
There are three of them.
What do they want?
Same thing you do.
What?
To live.
But they're not alive.
There was a terrible tragedy in this hotel.
Something about the basement.
A mistake?
It's her.
It's Madeline.
That's where they hid her body.
You mustn't go down into the basement.
Why?
Is that where she's trapped?
Is her spirit trapped in there?
You can't save her.
They tried to warn her.
They tried to help her.
Who's they?
What do they want?
What happened?
I lost contact.
Luke.
No towels.
Luke!
OK.
That's it, I've had enough.
We're going back to your dad.
OK?
Drink.
Don't worry about Gozer and her demon seed leaving.
You actually did us a favor.
Claire, you're really freaking me out.
You gotta pull it together.
You're way out in the weeds right now.
It happened to me when I started messing around with this stuff.
You really gotta be careful about what's going on up here.
You start thinking you're seeing things and it might never stop.
OK, fine.
The dream is one thing.
But what about the piano?
And what about everything that Lee said?
I listened to the piano tape and I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe it's explainable.
Maybe it isn't.
But it's not worth getting yourself worked up over.
None of this is.
As for the kook upstairs...
Look, Claire, how many times have you seen someone on late night TV hawking their psychic wares to an audience full of rubes?
Tons, right?
And how many times have you seen a psychic in the newspaper, solving crimes or healing someone without medicine or winning the lottery?
Almost never, right?
That's because it's all bullshit.
It's hocus-pocus.
That woman upstairs is just an insecure old actress and she's just trying to stay relevant.
It's pathetic.
OK.
Don't you want to try to figure out what's going on here?
Why aren't you more intrigued by this?
I mean, this could be it.
This could be Madeline trying to make contact and you just don't even care.
Isn't this supposed to be your deal?
I swear to God, if that bitch is back with her kid...
Be cool.
Can I help you, sir?
Yes, I'd like a room for the night, please.
OK, just one night?
Yes.
I'd like Room 353, please.
I'm sorry, sir, that room's not available right now.
We only have rooms available on the second floor on account of this being our last weekend open.
No.
I must have Room 353, please.
This is very important to me.
I came a long way.
Sir?
All the rooms on the third floor have been stripped.
So if you don't mind bringing up some sheets and sleeping in a room without furniture then...
I think we can help you out.
That would be fine.
OK, well, if I could just get a credit card for the reservation.
I'll pay cash.
OK, we usually need a credit card in case there are any damages.
Take this, please.
OK.
Let's go get you some sheets.
Some sheets...
Have a nice day.
That was very kind of you, helping me out back there.
Oh, it's no problem.
I mean, I figured this whole place is gonna be a parking lot anyway so if somebody wants a certain room, who am I to stop them?
It's really no big deal.
Sir?
Oh, thank you.
353 is where
I spent my honeymoon.
Oh.
This old place holds some special memories for me.
It's interesting, come back to a place that feels like you never left.
Almost like you're right at home.
Don't you think?
I don't know.
Why don't we get you upstairs.
So, like we said, most of the rooms have been cleaned and stripped and most of the furniture and linens are in storage.
But lucky for you the owner was too cheap to hire real movers so all of the beds are still here.
The room might not have the same charm that you remember but at least you won't be sleeping on the floor.
That's alright.
I'm just here for one last bit of nostalgia.
OK, well, here we are room 353.
The honeymoon suite.
And if you change your mind and decide you want to move to a room with a TV, just let us know.
That won't be necessary.
This is just what I came for.
Thank you so much.
OK, well, enjoy your stay.
If I'm gonna stay up all night with you, you're gonna get drunk with me.
Cheers.
How ya feeling?
Better.
Good.
Keep drinking.
It always helps.
Hi, Lee.
Hi.
How was your seminar?
Very good, thank you.
How are you two doing?
Not bad.
You want a beer?
No, thank you.
Really?
I heard you were a huge drinker.
Well, we all have our moments.
So, Lee, tell me...
How does it all work?
How does what work?
You know, being a psychic and all that.
Well, uh...
Have you ever been somewhere new and sworn that you've been there before?
Like déjá vu.
Exactly.
Well, if you've ever experienced what you call a déjá vu then you have the same
God-given ability I have.
In fact, we all do.
It's just that...
Well, sometime's my déjá vu's happen in another direction.
I can experience certain feelings before they happen, but it's not always clear when or where they come from so I have to be very careful in...
What I choose to share.
OK.
Well.
I'm really tired so I'm going to go upstairs and go to sleep.
It's been a long day.
I'll come find you tomorrow before you leave, Lee.
Don't let the spirits keep you up all night.
Dude, you didn't need to say that.
That was really mean.
Oh, whatever.
You said it yourself.
She made you feel like an asshole.
Besides, everyone needs a taste of their own medicine once in a while.
You want another one?
Yeah.
Alright, you ready?
Yeah.
OK, this is Claire's haunted reenactment, take one.
Interior.
The Yankee Pedophile.
Wha...
Was that the piano?
What?
Was it playing by itself?
It must be the ghost of Madeline O'Malley trying to tell me something.
Show yourself, spirit!
I say, show yourself, spirit!
There she is.
Poor, poor, Madeline O'Malley.
You think she's prettier than me?
Honestly?
Yeah.
She's a little homely for my taste.
I think you're much prettier, Claire.
Thank you.
That's nice of you to say.
In fact, Claire, I think you're one of the prettiest girls I know.
Who are the others?
Uh... My mother, my sister, and that girl that works at the Dairy Queen.
The one with the lazy eye?
I find laziness very attractive.
I really like you, Claire.
I really like you, too.
No, I mean it.
You're like the coolest person.
I just really feel like we mesh.
You know, I love the fact that you support me with the website and I just love the fact that you take me seriously.
It means a lot.
You're great.
Even if I'm going a little bit crazy?
You're not going crazy, you're great.
I would do anything for you.
Really?
Absolutely.
Just...
I like you so much.
Hey.
I have an idea.
Me too.
What's yours?
Let's go to the basement and find out what that fucking ghost's problem is.
OK.
That's a good omen.
Turn the recorder on.
What was that?
I tripped.
Oh.
Eh.
Sorry.
It's just the light thing.
- Spider web.
- Follow me.
Follow me.
I'm starting to think we should've bought breadcrumbs.
Hang on.
I hear something.
It's weird.
There was static.
I heard that too the other night.
Must be a bad cable.
No.
It's her.
This way.
This is it.
This is where they hid her body.
You ready?
We wish to speak to the spirit of Madeline O'Malley.
If you are here with us, give us a sign.
Make a noise if you can hear us.
Why do you stay here, Madeline?
Why does your spirit never rest?
Whoa.
Madeline.
Give us a sign.
Did you feel that?
It's her.
That was wind.
No, she's with us right now.
Madeline, speak to us.
We wish you no harm.
Why do you stay here?
Why does your spirit never rest?
Wait! No!
Madeline. We know that you're here right now.
Speak to us.
I can hear her.
Do you hear the whispering?
Madeline?
Holy shit.
What?
She's right behind you.
She's coming closer.
Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
I gotta get out of here!
What?!
I don't want to be here any more.
I don't like this!
What are you talking about?
We just made physical contact!
Why are you freaking out?!
I just don't want to be here any more!
That's it!
Why? Was it different than the times you saw her?
There were no other times!
What?!
I made it up!
I never saw anything!
I made it all up.
I don't want anything to do with this any more.
This is just too fucked up.
I gotta go.
Luke!
Luke, don't go!
I'm sorry, Claire!
You can't leave me here!
I'm really sorry.
What am I gonna do now?
Lee.
Lee!
Lee.
Lee! Lee!
Lee, wake up.
I need your help.
Help me.
Lee.
What are you doing in my room?
Get out of here!
No! No! Please!
Please! Please!
No, I will not you.
Please go away.
Come on!
Why should I help you?
So you can make fun of me some more?
You know,
I believe in what I do.
And I don't believe in wasting my time on lowly hotel employees and their insulting ignorance.
Lee, I'm sorry, OK?
I should've defended you downstairs,
I made a really big mistake, OK?
But I have a problem.
I'm scared and I'm alone,
Madeline made contact with me!
I don't know what else to do, OK?
I don't know what else to do!
Is there any more vodka over there?
Let me check.
Yeah, I found this one.
OK.
Take me to where it happened.
Wait here.
Lee!
Was it Madeline?
Did you see her?
Lee, what happened?!
We must get out of this hotel.
You're in grave danger.
You can't stay here any longer.
What?!
I have to go get dressed.
Go get your things.
Trust me.
Oh no.
Lee!
I forgot something!
I'll meet you in the lobby!
Sir.
Sir?
Sir, I'm sorry that I'm disturbing you but there's been an emergency and I have to leave the hotel for a little bit.
Sir, can you hear me in there?
Sir?
Oh, shit!
Luke?!
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry I shouldn't have left you like that.
- Please don't be mad at me!
- No, no, no!
- Listen, we need to get out of here right now!
- No, no, no, Claire,
I have to tell you something.
No! Listen to me, OK!
- Remember the old man upstairs?
- Yeah, yeah! So what?!
He's dead! He killed himself!
He's dead!
- What?
- Yeah!
He's dead!
Did you call the police?!
No!
Not yet!
And Lee said that it's not safe to be here any more and we have to leave right now and I saw Madeline
- and she's trying to get me!
- OK, OK, wait a second!
Hold on, hold on!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come here.
Jesus Christ.
Here, sit down.
It's alright.
His face.
There was blood everywhere.
It's OK.
Please, please, please just get me out of here.
I don't want to be here any more.
Please.
Alright, OK.
Come on. Let's go.
- Lee! She's still upstairs!
- Where is she?
I don't know!
She's getting her things.
Alright, I'll go get her and you just stay put for a second.
Are you gonna be alright down here for a minute?
Yeah.
It's fine.
It's gonna be OK.
Just hold on.
Lee?
Is that you?
Lee?
Lee?
Lee?
I don't wanna go back down there.
Are you down there?
Somebody help me!
Please!
Somebody help me!
Please!
Please help me!
Please! Please help!
No! Please!
Please! Please!
No! No!
Alright guys, hold it up
Hold it up.
God. Jesus.
Alright, get her out of here.
I was banging on the door as hard as I could.
I could hear her screaming.
I was screaming for her to open up but she wouldn't.
She called my name but I wasn't strong enough to break it down.
This was at the bottom of the stairs.
Alright, listen, I'm gonna need you to come with us and answer some questions about the gentleman upstairs.
And help get in contact with her family.
Can you do that?
- Yeah, I just gotta get my stuff.
- OK.
Think you tell the actress to hurry up while you're in there?
We need her too.
Yeah.
Oh, listen, you sure you gave me all the names and numbers of the other guests?
Nobody you might be forgetting?
No, I gave you everything.
There was just that other woman and her kid and Ron, the owner, but he doesn't get back from Barbados until tomorrow.
Alright, thanks.
What are you doing in here?
They're looking for you downstairs.
I said I'd find you.
We have to go to the police station now to answer more questions.
Did you hear me?
I said we have to go.
You knew this was gonna happen didn't you?
You could've done something.
No.
There's nothing anyone could've done.
They're looking for you downstairs.
South Hartford 911.
What is your emergency?
This is Lieutenant Dreyfus, badge number 3525, at 174 Willow Lane.

WJBP, Channel 11.
A quiet South Hartford community was leveled by tragedy as three clergy members were found dead.
At about 11:47 p.m. on Sunday evening, the 20th, we received an emergency call on our 911 line.
At least three bodies were taken out of this house, two local priests and a nun.
We checked the location for any other victims and have not found any.
Apparently, Maria Rossi was hosting a church group meeting at her home.
Our homicide detectives and our lab people
are conducting their investigation.
Mrs. Rossi was found by police in a crawl space.
We can't speculate as to what
the cause or the motive may have been.
They are not ruling out any possibilities.
However, at this time, we don't want to speculate
on what may or may not have been the cause.
My name is Isabella Rossi and that was my mother.
The thing you have to understand about my mother is that she just had a huge heart.
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain.
And there we are.
That was actually on my...
Can you see that?
That was my first birthday party.
And I don't think it was until I was about six years old that
I actually started to notice, you know,
something was different, her moods were changing.
Then, she went away for a little bit
and when she came back they said she was better.
But she wasn't.
We couldn't understand what was happening.
No one had answers.
So why are you doing this film?
Because I really need to understand what happened.
What Maria Rossi did, and her subsequent life, was incredibly tragic and clouded.
And caught in the middle of it is a daughter who is just now learning
the circumstances of that tragedy.
Isabella, look at the camera, honey.
If someone had asked me how is it possible for Mrs. Rossi to have done what she did,
I would have gone through the list of things that cause human aggression.
Something like major depression, or schizophrenia,
or dissociative identity disorder.
It's my understanding that her current psychiatric diagnosis has been D.I.D.
But this is her seventh different diagnosis since 1987.
You start wondering, is it in my genes?
You know, am I going to flip out one day?
Just a matter of time?
Two years after she brutally murdered three people in her home, a South Hartford jury
found Maria Rossi not guilty by reason of insanity.
Rossi was committed to the South Hartford State Asylum.
And then in September of that year,
my mother was transferred to the Centrino Mental Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Rome, Italy.
I never really questioned why Italy.
When did your father tell you what really happened?
May 23, 2009. I was 25 years old.
He just said it. He said,
"Mom attacked those people during an exorcism."
An exorcism performed on her.
It's the job of science to try to sort out what is a reasonable, plausible explanation.
But science can't explain everything, such as a person levitating two feet off the ground during an exorcism.
I asked my dad if he thought she was possessed.
He said he didn't know.
That she was gone. It didn't matter.
Not any more.
He died three days later.
I called the church where the priests had come from.
And they wouldn't talk about it.
They said they don't have an ordained exorcist and never did.
So we're on our way to see the Vatican School for Exorcism.
And to see my mother.
Are you nervous?
Yeah, I'm nervous.
Twenty years is a long time, you know?
So, later, I was contacted by the Diocese of Rome.
They told me they never authorized my mother's exorcism.
That's when I knew I had to go to Italy.
I wonder how seriously they take the exorcism school, you know.
I hope it's not a joke.
Oh, wow.
There it is, St. Peter's Square.
Something like that.
This school has drawn a lot of interest from all over the world.
Maybe it can help me understand my mother's situation a little better.
From post-traumatic shock to serious injury, death even.
And not just for the victim.
Also for the family members, for anyone in the vicinity, especially the priest.
Sometimes a person can be tormented by more than one demon in what we call multiple demonic possession.
These cases are extremely volatile and dangerous, and they sometimes lead to transference, which means the demon jumps from one person to another.
The purpose of the class is to educate priests and, of course, laypeople, about the Devil's presence in their lives, in modern society.
For example, in Italy alone
there are over 800 satanic cults.
We had a problem.
We needed more exorcists.
If it is possession, then first and foremost
we must rule out mental illness.
Schizophrenia. Bipolar disorder.
The course is designed to explore all these conditions.
Okay, anyone, any thoughts on that?
I believe the subject was clearly possessed.
The subject spoke in multiple languages.
Come on. Speaking in tongues? Maybe.
Incoherent babbling from a mentally-disturbed person, certainly.
I'm sorry, Father.
And the subject displayed abnormal strength when confronted with holy water, and while heavily sedated.
The delusional mind of a paranoid schizophrenic may actually react to holy water as if it were,
I don't know, acid, urine.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to disagree.
The girl fractured her own femur.
Her strength might have been abnormal, but not impossible.
It's very well known that some epileptics do break their bones during a seizure. It's a fact.
As I said, we must be sure to rule out mental illness.
In the end, this case could not be proved as possession.
The diversity of the class was comforting.
It wasn't just priests or nuns, but regular people,
people who are facing the same things I'm facing.
People like me, looking to help someone.
So why are you here?
All this knowledge, you all agree on this, all this knowledge is invaluable for us, no?
David, what would you say drew you to this school?
In particular, to exorcism?
The combination of science and religion.
I think, based on my background in medicine, it gave me a greater sense of purpose.
We all talk so definitively about God and about the Devil but we can all agree that there's no real facts, right? No proofs?
God has never helped me.
What about you?
Sure. Yeah.
So when do you actually witness an exorcism in class?
This class is all theory.
This is a school of exorcism, is it not?
It's not reality.
Look at the tape we watched today.
That girl fit every criteria for possession except she wasn't.
It's a mental disorder.
No. When you witness someone possessed, you'll know the difference.
You say that like you have.
Have you witnessed a real exorcism,
Father?
Yeah. Right after he saw the Easter Bunny.
I may have.
Can I ask you something, Isabella?
- Sure.
- I'm curious.
Why are you doing this documentary?
I will be honest. My mom.
When I was about eight years old she murdered three people.
Members of her church.
I found out that she had committed these murders during an exorcism.
An exorcism on her.
- See you.
- It was nice meeting you.
Your mother must be at Centrino, right?
- Have you seen her yet?
- Tomorrow.
Okay, well, the class won't give you the answers you need.
You need to see a real one.
How do you know when it's real?
You know.
Good luck.
Thanks.
That was interesting.
- Hey.
- What are you looking at?
My mother's hospital instruction manual.
Look at this thing, it's huge.
Okay.
So, camera one, two and three.
Which one do I look at?
You don't have to look directly at the camera.
Right. I knew that.
Remember, the cameras are always running when the car's on.
Let's go.
You know, my father received a letter from Rome.
I guess because priests were involved.
The Holy Church got involved as well.
And they said that they wanted to treat my mother at Centrino.
They called it an "offering of forgiveness."
And I remember thinking that meant
God was forgiving my mother.
I was young.
Okay.
- No camera.
- Show him the media pass.
It felt like a prison.
An old prison, really.
But Dr. Costa seemed concerned, so that was good.
Follow me.
I only show you this because your mother has not had a violent outburst in over 7 years.
She's extraordinarily anti-religious.
We refrain from religious items and discussion at all times.
They can make her hostile.
But I want to put...
That's enough.
That's enough.
I'm not sure if you knew this, doctor, but my mother was involved in an exorcism while she committed those murders.
Did you know that?
Isabella, your mother's case, although unique, is not a matter of demonic possession.
It's a matter of brain function.
So why do you think she was transferred all the way from the States to Rome?
I don't know.
It was before I arrived here.
Unfortunately, we've had to keep her heavily medicated.
An exhaustive amount of meds, to be honest.
Antipsychotics.
Sedatives. Anti-anxiety.
It constantly changes.
She is a very, very complex patient.
Miss Rossi, let's keep moving.
She is having a very good day today.
But there still are rules.
Don't talk about faith or God.
And stay passive.
Hostility and aggression are...
Well, they've provoked her in the past.
Just precautions. It will be fine.
In fact, there is a very good chance she won't even recognize you.
Maria?
You have a visitor.
Come. Come.
Hi, Mom.
I like your drawings.
Maria, I'd like to speak with you if you'd let me, please.
My name is Isabella.
Isabella Rossi.
I'm your daughter.
I just haven't seen you in a long time.
Connect the cuts.
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.
Connect the cuts.
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.
Do you recognize this?
Do you know how to connect the cuts?
I don't know what that means.
Connect the cuts.
Did you do that to yourself?
Please stop.
Maria, I came a very long way to see you.
Do you want to see my painting?
Yes. I'd like that. I'd love that.
Yes, yes. Maria, he was your husband.
You loved him very much.
Do you remember?
Who are you?
I'm Isabella. I'm your daughter.
- I don't have a daughter.
- Yes, yes, you do.
We just haven't seen each other in a very long time.
I don't have a daughter.
Do I?
Why? Why?
Why not?
Well, thank you for coming.
Please say hello to your family from me.
Have a nice day. Thank you for coming.
I have to go. I have to go.
I have to get ready. I have to get ready.
I have to get ready. Get ready.
Get ready.
You shouldn't have killed.
What did you say?
Maria, please. I don't have a lot of time.
Please, tell me something.
You shouldn't have killed your child.
What?
It's against God's will, you know.
Out, out, out!
Shit, that was great.
That was great stuff.
Are you all right?
Isabella?
Isabella, I...
What's it like, losing both parents?
It feels empty.
Like there's no safety net to fall back on.
And it forces you to be resilient.
Possession and exorcism have dictated my life.
It took my mom and it basically killed my dad.
It defines me now.
I mean, here I am.
I flew halfway across...
You know, halfway across the world.
To see this woman who I never thought I'd see again.
I don't like that it defines me.
I contacted Father Ben Rawlings and David Keane
in hopes that they would review the footage of my mother.
Luckily, they agreed and invited me to their loft.
Isabella, hi, welcome.
- How are you?
- Good. Come in.
It's hard to say why I wanted to be a priest.
Maybe I was drawn to helping people.
I think that duality exists within all of us and, occasionally, it can take form.
Science can no longer help, and religion has to take over.
Which can be really difficult for people to accept.
Isabella, nice to see you again.
How are you? You okay? Okay, great.
- Can I get you a cup of tea or anything?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, I forgot your...
- Michael.
- Michael.
My family were always very religious.
My mother and father, they were teachers, but I was closest to my uncle.
He was a priest.
By the time I was 13, he told me that he was an exorcist.
And, well, if you can imagine...
It's like, I suppose, you know, you being told that your dad is Superman.
That's what it felt like to me.
That he was in direct, you know, war, I suppose, with the Devil.
And, I don't know, it blew me away, really.
And so, he took me along with him and by the time I was 18,
I'd seen four exorcisms.
I'd even assisted on one.
And it just changes you.
Unfortunately, he passed away a couple years ago.
Anyway, when I was 23,
I went into the priesthood.
And by the time I was 27,
I was an ordained exorcist.
But I'll tell you this.
After all the years that I've been in the Church
I've seen the Devil way more than I've seen God.
That's just not the way it's supposed to be.
There, what did she say to you there?
Yeah, at the end there, she started remembering things, specific things, and she said something to me.
But I'm not sure if she said...
What? What was it?
I terminated a pregnancy about four years ago.
The doctor said
I couldn't carry it to term, so...
Anyway, she knew about it, and she said that...
Something about being against God's will or something.
Hang on. Let's just look at that.
It's against God's will, you know.
That means something, right?
Possibly. You said you had a copy of her medical charts?
What are those?
She cuts herself.
Those are crosses, Ben.
Crosses? Wait, wouldn't she not want crosses if she's possessed?
- Not necessarily.
- Look at them. Look at them.
The way that she's seeing them, they're upside down.
They're inverted crosses.
They're typically used in Satanic rituals.
- I don't have a daughter.
- Wait, is she speaking with an accent?
Yeah, she did that some. Why?
Different accents can be like speaking in tongues.
The pregnancy, did you tell her about that at all?
No.
And you're absolutely sure there's no other way she could have found out?
I mean, there's no way.
See, there are basically four factors when it comes to determining demonic possession.
One, unnatural strength.
You got aversion to holy objects.
Languages or events that they could not have known.
And preternatural movement, which is basically objects moving around the room.
So, strength? No. Languages, no.
Preternatural movement, no.
Aversion to holy objects, maybe.
Yeah, but there are accents and, Ben, she knew that information.
Yeah, that interests me.
We need to show you something.
Okay. Can I bring the camera?
- Sure.
- All right.
Okay.
- Can I bring this?
- Yeah, of course. Come on through.
I'm good. I'm right behind you.
Keep going.
What is all this? Who are these people?
These are people the Church turned down for exorcism.
- And they're all possessed?
- We believe they are.
These two cases are resolved.
Those two are open and we're almost done with this one.
This is the girl, Rosa, right?
From the video we saw in Gallo's class?
You both thought she was possessed.
She is.
We think the Church made a mistake.
So correct me if I'm wrong, but you guys are performing these exorcisms yourselves, without the Church's permission?
That's right. We have to. Otherwise, these people would continue to suffer.
What is all that?
We monitor everything.
Heart rate, blood pressure.
We monitor everything.
Heart rate, blood pressure.
Yeah, go ahead.
That's a camera we use to determine pupil dilation, which is very important in cases of possession.
Nine millimeters is as large as the average pupil gets.
Maybe 10 or 11 under certain substances like cocaine, psilocybin, methamphetamines.
Anything above 11 is considered preternatural.
Why doesn't the Church help these people?
You see, that's just it.
The Church isn't in the business of healing people.
The bureaucracy won't allow it.
Their hands are tied. In 1999, the Church changed the exorcism rites for the first time in almost 400 years.
Now a priest has to be absolutely certain that there's an evil presence in order to even attempt an exorcism.
And that's a near impossible task, because a lot of the time it takes an exorcism for a demon to reveal itself.
But rather than get distracted by the Church's hypocrisy, we're going to continue to care for these people.
So that means that my mother's case can actually be something...
No, no. Isabella, you...
The Church will never pursue your mother's case because the last time someone did, people died.
What do you suggest?
If you really want to help your mother, you need a better understanding of exorcism.
A real understanding.
Okay. So take more classes and maybe show Gallo the tape?
Isabella, you'll learn more in five minutes of an exorcism than you will in three months in some class.
Plus, you'll get to know the real difference between possession and mental illness.
So witness a real exorcism?
With you?
If you want.
So the exorcism rites, when they were updated, what exactly changed?
Well, for one, all media coverage of exorcisms were banned.
Not that they were filmed much anyway.
Exorcisms can take minutes or they can take years.
No two are the same.
Is this thing we're doing even legal?
No. Not exactly.
You never know what's going to happen.
So do you still get nervous or...
No, not really.
Demons, like angels, have orders, or spheres, to be more specific.
A hierarchy, basically.
Now, it's imperative you get the demon to reveal itself so you can deduce its rank in that hierarchy.
In our last session we were able to hone in on our demon's identity.
His name is Berith.
Look, I know we went over this before.
Keep us between you and her, okay.
I'm not kidding.
All right, all right.
- Father.
- How is she?
- She's worse? Okay, let me see.
- No, no.
We had to move her downstairs.
To the basement.
The basement?
This is it.
We're actually going to see a person who is supposedly possessed.
So I guess now we'll see if it's bullshit or not.
She's in here.
Michael, come in.
Everyone, bow their heads.
Everyone, bow their heads.
May the Lord bless us and keep us.
May the Lord let His face shine upon us.
May the Lord lift up His countenance onto us and give us peace.
- Amen.
- Amen.
This really is no place for her,
Mrs. Sorlini.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
We don't know what to do.
Please, please, it's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.
Rosa?
Bless you for your prayers.
You must leave her to us now. All right?
Yes, Father.
This is to help loosen her limbs, keep her calm.
It's very similar to a muscle relaxant.
She's looking right at me.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's get set up.
It's best just to stay close to Michael, okay?
- A little to the right.
- No, no. It's set.
It is Thursday, December 3, 2009.
Subject, Rosa Sorlini.
Last session, November 13, 2009.
Rosa's appearance has worsened, skin color and weight.
Temperament appears stable.
Vitals are slightly elevated, but basically normal.
Her pupils are dilated to approximately nine millimeters.
Okay.
Let's begin.
Pupils still normal.
Rosa, are you in there?
Can you hear me?
I want to know how you're feeling today, Rosa.
I remember last time, Rosa, you were strong. You spoke to me.
No, no, she's strong.
And getting stronger than...
You don't want this one any more.
It's no good for you.
She said my name. She said my name.
- How did she know my name?
- Stay back. Don't listen to her.
Five minutes alone with her,
I promise you, her cunt will know me.
I want you to leave the girl out of this.
I know who you are, demon!
Your name is Berith!
Behold the Cross of the Lord.
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.
God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
I appeal to Your Holy Name that you graciously grant me help against...
That you graciously grant me help against this unclean spirit that's tormenting this creature of Yours!
Ben, she's hemorrhaging!
God, creator and defender of the human race, who made man in Your own image, look down in pity on this, Your servant!
Help me hold her down, Ben.
Ben, help me hold her down.
Taste it, bitch!
Come taste your mother's sweet milk!
Stay back.
Inserting anti-coagulant.
...overwhelms it with fear and panic.
Repel, O Lord, the Devil's power.
Break asunder his snares.
You can't hide, Berith!
The Mystery of the Cross commands you!
Blood pressure's way up, 190 over 110!
Come on, hang in there!
Heart rate's up. So is blood pressure.
190 over 110. Hang in there.
Blood pressure's going crazy!
It's 220 over 110! Say it, Ben!
St. Barnabas commands you!
- Ben?
- Just keep hold of her!
Ben, I can't hold her!
- Oh, my God! Where is she?
- David! David!
I can't see! I need light! I need light.
Do something!
Get her back on the bed! Ben!
- Get her legs.
- Michael, get away.
I'll carve out your diseased heart and eat it!
I have a whole army of angels and the Lord Almighty by my side!
You want pain? I'll give you pain!
St. Barnabas commands you!
From whose sight you are not hidden!
St. Barnabas commands you!
St. Barnabas commands you!
You foul, treacherous beast!
Give way to Christ, in whom you found none of your works!
Bow down before God!
Okay, bring her back on her legs.
She's stabilizing.
She's stabilizing.
Turn that off. Yeah.
She's stabilizing.
Turn that off. Yeah.
Turn that off. Yeah.
I don't know what to say.
Right there, right there, you see how her pupil is normal again?
That indicates that she's clean.
Now that you have this, now you can tell the Church, right,
- That you saved her?
- No.
Yeah, it worked. But that doesn't mean the Church will support it.
That doesn't make any sense. Why not?
Because...
Because the Church would have us arrested and deported.
What we're doing in the eyes of the Church is very wrong.
That's why we know it's so right.
Look, her appearance is completely normal, and so quickly after the exorcism.
Hello? This is she. Excuse me.
R-O-S-S-I.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
I'm her daughter.
I just got here from America.
I think that's a big mistake. We could go back to the charts, you'll see that...
This is amazing.
Thank you.
That was the Diocese of Rome.
I asked for a reevaluation of my mother.
What did they say?
They thanked me for my concerns and said that any interference would probably jeopardize her well-being.
And that God would be watching us over these trying times.
Are you all right?
Fine.
I can't believe the Church turned her down.
Of course they're gonna turn it down.
...go straight to Dr. Costa with my own doctor, like David.
The hospital is outside Vatican City walls, and I think that means it's out of their jurisdiction.
- What are you two talking about?
- What's that?
What are you talking about?
- Okay. Okay.
- We need to talk.
- David? Do you have a sec? Okay.
- Yeah.
We don't know what's wrong with Isabella's mother.
Nobody does because she hasn't been evaluated in over 15 years.
She deserves a second opinion.
A second opinion?
It would give us enough time to determine her condition.
No, you want to give an exorcism to Isabella's mother.
That's not what we're saying.
We just need time and we need to know that she's actually possessed.
Yeah, then she can get the proper attention.
Look, okay, that's not how this works.
You're here to document, you're not here to get involved.
- First of all, it's illegal.
- No, it's not illegal.
Yes, Ben, it is!
And in the eyes of the Church...
You know, forget about the Church,
David!
Why does it always come down to that?
What if this works?
What if we find out that it's not D.I.D.?
Yeah, think about it, David.
This could work.
Michael, I know what you're doing.
I know it would be provocative for your film, but we will be arrested.
How would it even work?
As soon as they found out what we were doing, they'd shut us down.
The staff won't be allowed with us in the room.
Yeah, we should have that right to privacy on her behalf, right?
Yeah, you're right.
David, just...
What if it was your own mother?
I'm really nervous.
I'm an active priest in good standing with the Holy See.
I'm an active priest in good standing with the Holy See.
And regardless of the outcome, the Church will find out, and it will put my job in jeopardy.
Father Ben Rawlings.
But at the same time, there are problems within this institution.
There are things that I don't agree with.
In the case of Maria Rossi,
I think we should take the time to actively deduce whether or not she's being tormented by an evil presence.
I think.
What's the Church's stance on Maria Rossi?
Well, she's faded into the system.
She's pumped full of drugs and forgotten.
If she becomes too difficult, there's a panic button on the wall.
- Yeah?
- Yes, I saw that. Thank you.
The bottom line here is that something horrible happened back in 1989.
And it wasn't Maria Rossi's fault.
You'll be screening her using SCID-D?
Two hours?
More or less two hours, yeah. I'd say so.
I feel the Church needs to change.
We're so eager to just brush things under the carpet as if they don't exist.
I don't fit in this Church, in this guise of the Church.
And I have to do what I believe.
I'll see you soon, Maria.
I know it's dangerous, and it might not even work.
But I can't just sit back and do nothing.
Okay, not a problem.
The time is 8:32 a.m. on Monday, December 7, 2009.
Subject is Maria Rossi. Session one.
Subject appears docile.
Heavily medicated.
Pupils are mildly dilated due to the medication.
Okay. Let's wake her up.
When she wakes up, we'll see if she gets a reaction.
Counteracting medication.
Medication should take effect in 20 seconds.
- So this is when you provoke her?
- Exactly.
Ten seconds.
Five, four, three, two, time.
Maria?
Maria, do you know what this is?
Maria, is there someone in there with you?
I don't know.
Yes, you do, Maria.
Who's in there?
We can help you.
We can free you from it.
EKG is normal.
They'll be angry.
There's more than one?
Maybe she's clean.
What was that?
Yeah, we got something.
Her pupil's still normal.
It's nothing.
Is she all right?
Yeah, she...
She's sleeping.
That's the first time
I've seen a possessed person fall asleep when confronted by a priest and holy water.
What does that mean?
I don't know. I think...
I think we might be wasting our time.
I came here for her and I'm going to do everything I can to help her.
This isn't consistent with any form of possession that I've ever seen.
I'm sorry, Isabella. This...
Her pupils are almost fully dilated!
Lord, have mercy! Christ, have mercy!
- What are you doing?
- We're helping her, David!
We need to help her!
- Ben, this is not the time or the place!
- Stay back.
I need you to calm down.
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, hear us.
- Christ, please hear us.
God, the Father in Heaven.
I know you! I know you, little girl!
God, the Father in Heaven.
God, the Father in Heaven, most merciful.
God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
I appeal to Your Holy Name.
- Against this unclean spirit!
- I know you!
Shove that needle in your fucking eye, you faggot!
I adjure you, ancient serpent by the judge of the living and of the dead.
- Don't get too close.
- By your Creator...
- Ben? Ben?
- Michael!
The faith of the holy apostles and of all the saints commands you,
- Reveal yourself before the Creator!
- Watch it!
David!
The devout prayers of holy men...
God the Father commands you!
You can't get back in your God's good graces, priest.
Not after what you did.
- Ben, what are you doing?
- Her vitals are going crazy.
Get back. Get back.
Michael, put the camera down and help!
I want to help her!
Get her leg! Get her leg!
Careful. Grab her leg!
I got her. Get her arm.
Isabella, is it locked?
- Close the bolt!
- Yes! Yes!
Tell me your name, coward!
Asbeel!
Come that close to me one more time and I'll use your tongue to skull fuck the baby killer over there!
The itsy bitsy spider came down the water spout.
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun...
Isabella, don't listen to it.
It's not your mother.
- Come on, baby.
- Isabella, it's not your mother!
You know the words.
Isabella, snap out of it!
- Do it!
- Demons!
You are guilty before our Lord Jesus Christ.
You are guilty before our Lord Jesus Christ whom you dared to nail upon the cross.
Pulse is 284. Rhythm is way off.
I'm not like the others, demon!
Do you hear me, transgressor?
- I hear you, priest.
- Seducer!
All you fucking do is talk!
The holy apostles Peter and Paul and all the saints command you.
Give way to Christ, in whom you found none of your works!
For it is not He who condemns you, but rather He who rules the living and the dead.
Our Father, who art in heaven...
- No, it's gonna kill her!
- Just stay there, Isabella.
No, no, no.
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
Let my mother go.
You'll burn.
You'll burn eternal.
Poor child.
- Please, open this door now!
- Pulse is dropping.
Maria? Maria, can you hear us?
Starting to regain consciousness.
Temp is returning to normal.
Over.
- Tell me your name, coward!
- Asbeel!
I'll be feeling that tomorrow.
See, this is preternatural movement right here.
I've seen it before, but I've never captured it on tape.
So, what does that mean?
It means we've got everything that we need right here.
This is huge, Isabella.
Let's play it again.
Do you realize how big this is?
With the evidence we've got, the Holy See has to see us.
They have to.
We can go to the press with this and in an instant, we'd have
1,000 people standing out there.
Our priority right now should be getting her back to the States.
The endorsement of Dr. Costa is vital.
But after the results that he saw, there's no way that he can't agree.
Dr. Costa doesn't believe that she was possessed or anything.
He thinks it was an exercise that shocked her system.
Anyway, it doesn't matter what he believes because his referral's actually gonna help us get her back to the States.
You can't get back in your God's good graces, priest.
What are you doing?
I'm just...
I'm just analyzing Maria's audio.
I'm just trying to work out if there is more than one voice inside her.
See, there can...
See? See? Right there. You hear that?
- She's speaking in tongues, right?
- No, no.
It's one sentence, spoken in more than one language, I think.
I'm just trying to isolate how many.
You wanted him to die, didn't you?
Ben, what is she talking about?
You wanted him to die, didn't you?
Is she talking about your uncle?
I found four voices on the recording.
I found four voices on the recording.
- You found four?
- Wait, what does that mean?
It means that the entity in your mother had disciples.
We call it multiple demonic possession.
You might have heard
Gallo talking about it in class.
Wait, so it's a powerful demon.
Yeah. It's a beast.
- What?
- You know how lucky we are?
Look, we're gonna deliver all our findings to the Holy See next Friday.
Yeah, maybe.
He hasn't agreed to see us.
Yeah, well, have you told him that the press might be interested?
That's not very diplomatic.
Can't we just wait a little bit till my mother's case is resolved?
I mean, the press?
Hang on a minute. Just because you've got what you want now, you're expecting us just to keep quiet?
Michael, please, just get...
Stop! Stop! That's not what I meant!
Because there are lot more people to help rather than just your mother, okay?
- Wait, did Father Gallo call you?
- What's your problem?
No. You?
Yeah, he called me twice.
What did he say?
He wants to help us make the right decision.
He's worried about us.
Especially, he's worried about me.
- You? Why?
- Because of my job, Ben.
David, what are you doing with the papers? Are you okay?
I'm fine. The conversation's just giving me a little bit of a headache.
David, he's just trying to scare you.
That's all.
- Is that blood?
- He's a moral man.
And he's toeing the company line on this one and you know it.
Is your nose bleeding?
David, you got something.
Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm fine.
Look.
I'm sorry.
It's probably stress.
- It's a lot of work to do for Friday.
- Yeah.
Are you all right?
- They won't release her.
- What?
- Why not?
- I don't know. They won't say.
They can't or won't believe that she's better.
- Where are my keys?
- I don't...
Where are my fucking keys?
They were right here.
- I don't know. Relax.
- Where are my fucking keys, Michael?
I don't know.
It feels like they'll never release her.
There's no way the Church can't see this.
I can look them in the eye and tell them that it was the right thing to do.
This is what they do.
They cover things up, they ignore it, no matter who it hurts or destroys.
Well, not this time.
Not this fucking time.
This was supposed to be about my mother. Not anybody else.
Not about Ben's ego, or David's job.
I have a sinking feeling I'm going to be excommunicated for all this. I think.
For what we did.
David's inner coward is really coming out.
Ben and David, maybe I get them.
They have their own thing going on, but Isabella, we started this together.
Michael just has to stop.
He just wants to...
They have this group of three and I'm like the annoying guy with the camera.
David, what the fuck are you doing?
If it weren't for me no one would know anything about what the hell they're doing in their Church and in their basements.
Look, I really think we need to talk about some stuff.
- What's wrong with the camera?
- I don't know. Just...
What's wrong?
- Not then. Before she hit you.
- Michael, did you see anything?
No, I didn't see anything.
- Okay, we'll just try another...
- This is something else.
Yeah, but it's at the exact same time.
It must have been just a power surge through the hospital.
It's the only thing I can think of.
For all the cameras?
It could be something else.
- Hey, we're filming.
- I'm sorry.
- David, you have to see this.
- I have to go.
- I said we're filming.
- I know. I heard you. I got to go.
What's the matter?
- The bishop denied our request.
- What?
It's just a bloody meeting.
What was the reason?
The incident's under investigation.
- Well, of course it is.
- David...
- David.
- Yeah?
- It's going to be okay. All right?
- I hope so.
- I hope so.
- David, wait, wait.
I'm coming with you, remember?
The baptism?
Come on. Let's go.
- Michael, how long is this going to take?
- Just a second.
- Do we really need this?
- Yep.
- Are you okay with that, David?
- I'm fine. You ready?
Baptism, baptism.
Baptism is the transferal of sins,
both original and personal.
Now, for example,
if a baby were to die after being baptized it would go to Heaven.
And if before it would go to Hell.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Brethren, our fair Father Christ in His great loving kindness hath ordained that His mystic bride, the Holy Mother of the Church, to protect her children at every stage from the cradle to the grave.
And to this end is the Sacrament of Holy Baptism ordained.
Amen.
John Thomas, in the name of Christ our Lord
I anoint thee with oil for thy safekeeping.
John Thomas,
I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
David? What's he doing?
David!
- Father, stop.
- Please stop!
What are you doing, David?
David, stop, stop!
David! For God's sake!
Somebody, stop him!
You know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to take this fucking camera, turn it around and stick it in Michael's face.
I'd like to ask him,
"What was it like, Michael?"
"What was it like when"
"your mom fucked your father's best friend?"
David?
Hey, David!
Michael, what's wrong with David?
What's happened?
What's going on?
The...
The kid almost died.
What?
What happened? What did you say?
The baby he was baptizing, he almost drowned it.
- What are you doing?
- Setting up the camera.
- No, wait. Just leave the camera.
- Is the baby okay?
Yeah, I think so.
You think so? Did you see it?
Were you there or not?
Do I think the baby's okay? Yeah.
Is he in trouble?
I don't know.
They called the police and he just left.
- David!
- Okay, just come back when you...
Well, he's been acting strange all day.
Did you see it happen?
See it? I filmed it! It was like he lost it!
He's been under a lot of stress lately, so maybe that contributed to...
I don't know.
You should have been there.
It was like he was crazy!
Has anything like this ever happened before?
No, of course not!
- David!
- David?
What the hell's going on?
Michael, get the camera.
We need the light.
- Ben?
- David?
David?
What's he doing up there?
Watch. Careful.
- What the hell is all this?
- I don't know.
Ben, are those Bible pages?
- Oh, Jesus.
- David!
Come here. What have you done?
Oh, my God, Ben.
He's bleeding all over.
Get his arms up.
Put them up. Put them up.
- No, no, no.
- What is it?
No, no, no.
- What do we do, Ben?
- I don't know!
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.
I don't know what to do!
Where's...
Go, go, go! Get out! Stay out!
Stay downstairs!
Don't come back upstairs again!
Just stay down there!
- Okay, okay.
- Look at me. Look in my eyes.
Michael, did you see his eyes?
Did you see his eyes?
Shit!
No, no.
Father Keane?
Where is Father David Keane?
- He's upstairs.
- He's very, very sick.
- Turn on the lights.
- I can't.
This is the only light we have.
- Are you David Keane?
- No, no.
He's upstairs, he's upstairs, but it's not safe to go up there!
Stay down here, please!
Holy shit.
Do you need the light?
David!
- He took your gun?
- Yes, he took my gun!
We need to get out right now.
All of us need to get out. We need to...
David? David?
David?
He's my friend!
David? David, listen to me.
Put down the gun.
- Just put down the gun, yeah?
- David...
Listen to me. It's Ben, okay?
It's your friend.
- No, no!
- Be quiet, Isabella.
David, listen to me, all right?
This isn't you.
Just listen to my voice, okay?
This is your friend, Ben.
This isn't you.
Something else has taken control of you.
You know this. You know this.
Okay?
Focus on my voice.
You need to trust me, David. Okay?
Just stay calm.
I can't stop. I can't stop it, Ben!
You can, you can fight it.
Just fight it! Fight it, David.
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth...
I forgot it.
- Just give me the gun.
- I forgot it.
He says to say, "Thank you".
Jesus!
The light!
Come here, come here. Oh, shit.
Fuck!
I need an ambulance now!
What's wrong with her?
She's having a seizure. Come here.
You saw his eyes, right?
- Ben!
- I saw his eyes!
- Tell me what's happening, Ben!
- I don't want to...
I got to know what's happening, Ben!
Maybe there's some transference.
Demonic transference?
Of course I mean demonic transference,
Michael!
- Transference like?
- Just fucking...
- Michael, please just shut the fuck up!
- Don't you fucking yell at me, Ben!
Of course I'm gonna fucking yell at you!
You've been here the whole fucking time!
Have you not listened to me?
Jesus.
No, no! Please, wait here.
Wait out there! Yes, please.
Her name is Isabella Rossi.
Can we see her yet?
I believe there's transference.
- I don't know. Not for certain.
- Who are you talking to?
More than one. Four, possibly.
Okay, okay. I'll bring her to you as soon as I can, Father Gallo.
Thank you.
Yeah, I know. It's David's fault.
The doctor asked me to talk to you, yes.
She's doing much better, your friend.
She's stable and she's resting, so I suggest you go.
When can we see her?
She's gonna be here overnight, so you can see her tomorrow.
Overnight? That's not possible.
Why is that?
There's something wrong with her.
It's not safe here.
No, this is very safe, I assure you.
Something's wrong with her.
We need to get her out of here right now.
No, gentlemen, we are extremely...
Do you know who Father Robert Gallo is?
Father Gallo, yes, I know him, but I don't understand...
Isabella?
Isabella?
What do we do, Ben?
Isabella, listen to me!
We need to get her out of here now!
Michael!
I've got her now!
We need to get her under control!
Help me, please!
I know this woman.
She needs to be sedated. Do it, now!
Jesus will bring your plans to nothing.
Christ will have none of your plans.
Let's take this outside.
Michael, put the camera down!
Listen to me. I'm a priest.
Please, go and help those people.
- Keep her here.
- Thank you, Father.
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Come on.
- She just killed that woman.
We need to end this.
Grab her legs. Help me grab her legs!
We're going to Father Gallo's.
What's he going to do?
I need help with the exorcism.
Get the door. Get the door.
Oh, my God. What have I done?
You really think Gallo's going to help?
Yeah, I need help.
I need to fix this.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. She's waking up.
She's waking up.
We haven't got much time, Michael.
We haven't got much time.
Stay with me. Don't let it get to you.
When I was 13, my uncle told me he was an exorcist.
You can't get back into God's good graces, priest.
Not after what you did.
Ben?
You wanted him to die, didn't you?
What is she doing?
He says to say, "Thank you."
Who are you?
You know me. Everyone knows me.
Lord, have mercy! Christ, have mercy!
God the Father!
Oh. My God!
Oh, shit!
Your place is in solitude!
Your abode is in the nest of serpents!
Be gone forthwith from this servant of God!
Get out of her! Get out of her!
It's working, right?
I have got her under control, but I don't know for how long.
You've got to hurry up.
It's okay.
It's going to be okay. I'm sorry.
Just be strong.
Be strong.
Just be strong.
Michael!
{2735}{2785}That's a fast fish.
{2786}{2861}C'mon... C'mon! C'mon!
{2862}{2899}Look at that!
{2900}{2984}Son of a bitch!
{5704}{5748}Help...!
{5749}{5823}Help me...!
{6211}{6276}PIRANHA
{9452}{9512}Officer! It was a mistake.
{9513}{9540}Can't we work something out here?
{9541}{9609}No! Mistake or no mistake.|you just destroyed public property.
{9610}{9636}And from the smell of your breath!
{9637}{9671}I suggest you take the ticket.
{9672}{9704}Maybe get a ride home with your friends.
{9705}{9774}Oh, I don't know, I was kinda|hoping you might drive me home.
{9775}{9846}Touching a officer's|uniform is consider assault?
{9847}{9869}Are you aware of that?
{9870}{9892}C'mon...
{9893}{10010}You look pretty hot in a tan.
{10014}{10024}It's not tan...
{10025}{10087}It's beige.
{10088}{10127}Hey, you think you can|take it easy on us?
{10128}{10164}You boys take one more step!
{10165}{10209}You'll be pissing lightning|bolts into next week.
{10210}{10270}Okay!
{10639}{10691}Yeah! Pretty much your|everyday in college.
{10692}{10722}Kelly! Hey! Hmm...
{10723}{10770}I wasn't sure you were coming back...
{10771}{10812}for spring break.
{10813}{10891}Yeah! I'm... I'm here.
{10892}{10958}I can only assume you're here to|get on one of those boats.
{10959}{10979}No, no...
{10980}{11054}I came down here to pick up|my little sister for music lessons.
{11055}{11096}How bout yourself?
{11097}{11131}I'm just waiting for my ride.
{11132}{11204}Todd and his friends... We're gonna|go check out some music.
{11205}{11248}Todd Dupree?
{11249}{11302}Remind me who you going out with again?
{11303}{11392}Guy have standards alright!|That's all I'm saying.
{11393}{11513}Look! Todd's a really good DJ.
{11531}{11557}Kelly!
{11558}{11639}Let's go! Jump in, we're late!
{11640}{11704}Listen! He says he's got|backstage passes for "Planners".
{11705}{11743}You should come.
{11744}{11764}Yeah I would...
{11765}{11829}But I'm pretty much under house arrest|watching Zana and Laura...
{11830}{11881}Then too bad.
{11882}{11930}I'll miss ya.
{11931}{11951}Anyway look! I'd gotta go.
{11952}{11973}C'mon! Let's go!
{11974}{12069}Yeah, yeah and hopefully I'll see|you again before you...
{12070}{12099}or you'll leave...
{12100}{12190}Gonna make a move, Jake.
{12191}{12234}Hey! Asswipe!
{12235}{12309}Cool shirt!
{12505}{12544}Nice horn.
{12545}{12572}Thanks.
{12573}{12634}Nice boobs.
{12635}{12662}Thanks
{12663}{12683}I have a training bra...
{12684}{12713}but I do not like to wear it.
{12714}{12754}Cos it itches.
{12755}{12839}Tell me about it.
{12840}{12874}Who're you waiting for?
{12875}{12920}My brother Jake. He's 17.
{12921}{12962}He'll like your boobs too.

{17725}{17787}Remember, if you do not|fulfill your responsiblity...
{17788}{17820}I have the power to arrest and...
{17821}{17869}and imprison you.
{17870}{17907}Mom, I'm not 12 okay.
{17908}{17951}playing the sheriff card|isn't gonna work anymore.
{17952}{18019}No?|- No.
{18020}{18095}Like I said, I'll take care of it okay?
{18096}{18135}Alright.
{18136}{18163}Better.
{18164}{18192}Get outta here.
{18193}{18257}Alright... Well next year I'll|try to find another solution.
{18258}{18281}Alright.|- Alright!
{18282}{18342}Okay.
{18498}{18526}Oh! And Jake?
{18527}{18574}Oh mom! C'mon on!
{18575}{18591}Really!
{18592}{18610}It's time for dinner.
{18611}{18755}Alright, alright... I'll be right there.
{19312}{19364}I hope I didn't wake the kids.
{19365}{19403}Oh god! They'll sleep thru anything.
{19404}{19488}So Maggie said that yesterday was|last time she saw them?
{19489}{19520}Yeah, just before noon.
{19521}{19593}She said Matt took the boat|out to catch some bass.
{19594}{19667}She drove around the lake|all night looking for him.
{19668}{19790}Where's the boat?|- Over there.
{20014}{20075}You feeling like a skinnydip?
{20076}{20132}Yeah, I think we can make|it to the end of the pier.
{20133}{20148}Meaning what?
{20149}{20180}I'm too old or I'm too heavy?
{20181}{20295}I think you're too chickenshit.
{20296}{20352}By the way, Gordon called last night.
{20353}{20378}Yeah?
{20379}{20486}He said the USGS recorded a heavy|seismic activity beneath the lake.
{20487}{20517}Really?
{20518}{20583}They're sending in a team|of seismologist divers.
{20584}{20605}Alright!
{20606}{20685}And he said you will escort them out.
{20686}{20739}Jesus Christ.
{20740}{20779}Just been invaded by 20,000 kids...
{20780}{20836}makes us a little busy at the moment.
{20837}{20925}You know. That's what I told them.
{20926}{21041}This doesn't sound too good.
{21359}{21385}So what time is the divers...
{21386}{21407}gonna get here?
{21408}{21497}He said about 10.
{21893}{21953}Shit.
{22049}{22134}C'mon just a little more.
{22135}{22214}Can't get it.
{22374}{22465}Give me your hand!
{22604}{22641}You think a propeller|could have done it?
{22642}{22659}I doubt it.
{22660}{22714}Look at the bones, nothing's broken.
{22715}{22759}It's like something acidic...
{22760}{22794}or toxic decomposition.
{22795}{22899}Well if the body's been|in the water for weeks.
{22900}{22998}What would you say if I was|thinking about closing the lake?
{22999}{23044}You know, just until we|get an autopsy report.
{23045}{23118}The autopsy report is gonna|take a couple of days.
{23119}{23183}It'll be easier to drain|this lake then to close it.
{23184}{23286}It's a big financial week for our town.
{23287}{23376}Too old for this.
{24984}{25009}We're not lying to mom.
{25010}{25035}Yeah! We're not lying to mom.
{25036}{25058}Come on guys...
{25059}{25088}every year it's the same thing.
{25089}{25113}I'm stuck here with you guys while...
{25114}{25167}I miss all spring break fun.
{25168}{25235}You mean spring break boobies?
{25236}{25266}What if I give you guys|the cash for babysitting?
{25267}{25315}Sixty dollars and you got a deal.
{25316}{25345}Sixty! I'm only getting paid forty!
{25346}{25478}Twenty dollars deception surcharge.

{43505}{43564}You just missed the|rest of the big show!
{43565}{43719}There you go girls! Come on up!|Give 'em some towels!
{43720}{43747}Wow! Good work!
{43748}{43795}waste time for canoe.
{43796}{43844}I must've gotten my knots mixed up!
{43845}{43902}So you caught zero fish|and you lose our only boat.
{43903}{43954}This sea is so full of accomplishment!
{43955}{44006}Jake is gonna kill us.
{44007}{44033}Somebody will see us.
{44034}{44092}Look! There's some boats|just right over there!
{44093}{44155}Don't waste your time,|they'll never see us.
{44156}{44235}They're way too far.
{44236}{44298}Hello!
{44428}{44490}Hello!
{44866}{44908}We need some help!
{44909}{44933}Hey!
{44934}{44995}We're over here!
{44996}{45101}Somebody please help us!
{46588}{46615}Look at the size of that!
{46616}{46680}What is it? A... a cavern system?
{46681}{46729}Looks to me like a subterranean lake.
{46730}{46822}Probably bigger then the one above.
{46823}{46853}You see that gap right there?|- Yeah?
{46854}{46884}Quake open that one up.
{46885}{46943}Now it's a|connecting passage.
{46944}{46967}- A lake under a lake.|- That's right.
{46968}{47036}Sorry! It's still your jurisdiction.
{47037}{47110}It's part of an old volcanic|ridge all over this area.
{47111}{47148}That's the beauty of it.
{47149}{47217}We're gonna be the first|ones to explore it.
{47218}{47235}You got it.
{47236}{47312}I don't know why you get|excited over that crap.
{47313}{47440}All I ever see is rocks and sand.
{47847}{47929}You should probably warn them|that it's not pretty down there.
{47930}{48017}Tourists treat this lake|like it's a gabbage can.
{48018}{48055}How you guys doing?
{48056}{48116}Sheriff said that it's a regular|treasure trove down there.
{48117}{48159}So...!
{48160}{48193}I got debs on these spent bubbles,
{48194}{48267}bad body sprays and|back issues of drugs.
{48268}{48316}I got debs on home appliances.
{48317}{48451}I got debs on missing college girls.
{48494}{48556}Oh my god.
{48557}{48613}This is the longest one I've ever seen.
{48614}{48765}Can you keep your mind|on the task at hand.
{48847}{48964}It's at least 100 feet Novak!
{49042}{49087}Almost full visibility.
{49088}{49127}Descending fissure!
{49128}{49220}My PO2 is set at 1. 1.3.
{49221}{49250}You should see this.
{49251}{49342}It's unbelievable.
{49357}{49384}Novak, do you copy?
{49385}{49476}Yeah! Pretty good.
{49541}{49737}Okay guys you are about 90 feet to the|entrance of the connecting passage.
{49738}{49788}Looks like single file time!
{49789}{49808}I'll go first.
{49809}{49882}No! I should do the prelim scout.
{49883}{49915}Your fat ass will get us stuck.
{49916}{49958}Baby! I'm like an eel.
{49959}{49997}I'm electric eel.
{49998}{50029}I get into such tight spaces.
{50030}{50079}It's shocking.
{50080}{50121}Huh! That's weird?
{50122}{50271}Here they are... but|they're spiltting up.
{50289}{50330}Guys?
{50331}{50506}Everything alright? I'm|losing you a little bit here.
{50718}{50757}I'm heading a serious|drop in temperature here.
{50758}{50807}It's at least 30 degrees colder.
{50808}{50927}You're probably at the|mountain near the water lake.
{50928}{51017}Do you have any visual?
{51018}{51119}I'm entering the cave.
{51616}{51664}Jesus!
{51665}{51773}This thing seems endless.
{52036}{52058}You gotta see this.
{52059}{52153}This is incredible.
{53553}{53660}Sam! What are you seeing down there?
{53661}{53721}Something bit me!
{53722}{53911}Oh yeah, right! I thought you|always love that kinda stuff.
{54068}{54134}Sam! Sam!
{54135}{54159}Sam! Answer me!
{54160}{54184}SAM!
{54185}{54243}Sam!
{54533}{54565}Something's happening.
{54566}{54594}What? You mean aftershock?|- I don't know...
{54595}{54691}Give me my flippers.
{55777}{55849}OH MY GOD!
{56491}{56514}Your body is a temple.
{56515}{56627}And now it is time to|give thanks to the gods.
{56628}{56673}Andrew, roll camera!
{56674}{56688}Kelly, you're up! C'mon!
{56689}{56731}Me! No! no, no...
{56732}{56795}No, thanks. I think very|had to drink too much.
{56796}{56843}Please! You don't want to worship this beautiful altar?!|- C'mon...
{56844}{56896}I know you're partial to the champagne,
{56897}{56956}but believe us you can|trust Crystal right?
{56957}{57006}Hey! C'mon Derrick, she... she said no.
{57007}{57024}No...
{57025}{57068}She said no thanks...
{57069}{57088}There's a difference...
{57089}{57178}She understands gratitude|is the right attitude.
{57179}{57204}Kelly!
{57205}{57224}Trust us!
{57225}{57266}It... It's never cheating|if it's with another chick!
{57267}{57298}Yeah! C'mon try it!|- C'mon.

{57334}{57378}Have fun!
{57379}{57435}Yeah! Jake! You're not|gonna take away the fun now?
{57436}{57560}Like I said... she's not my girlfriend.
{57561}{57615}Fine! I'll do it.
{57616}{57647}Okay!|- Yeah!
{57648}{57669}Okay!

{57945}{58003}Gonna get your lime!
{58004}{58040}Kelly! You don't have to do this.
{58041}{58134}I really don't think I need any|of your babysitting here. Jake!
{58135}{58200}Rachel!
{58237}{58278}Okay.

{60723}{60763}I'm coming!
{60764}{60858}I'm coming, hold your horses!
{60859}{60955}The store is closed!
{61106}{61221}I want to know what the hell|this thing is doing in my lake!
{61222}{61273}Where did you get this?
{61274}{61315}Oh! In the middle of the lake.
{61316}{61436}Where they're two people dead!
{61479}{61517}Oh my...
{61518}{61537}Oh my! Yeah! That's right...
{61538}{61564}Oh my, oh my.
{61565}{61601}Excuse me!
{61602}{61623}But!
{61624}{61661}Is that a fucking Piranha?
{61662}{61702}Carl! Not the only one.
{61703}{61725}Yeah! here, here, here, look at these...
{61726}{61766}There are thousands of them.
{61767}{61804}Thousands! And they're pissed.
{61805}{61848}You know I have heard|of these happening.
{61849}{61915}It's like those|alligators in New Jersey,
{61916}{61964}Someone leaves them and then they breed!
{61965}{62011}What?|- No...!
{62012}{62079}Who release this fish into the lake...
{62080}{62122}What are you talking about?
{62123}{62143}THIS!
{62144}{62198}Particular piranha,
{62199}{62241}Vanished! Off the face of the earth!
{62242}{62367}More than two million years ago!
{62396}{62501}Emm... Where's he going?
{62558}{62600}Allow me...
{62601}{62685}to introduce...
{62743}{62809}The "Pygocentrus Nattereri"
{62810}{62890}The regional Piranha!
{62891}{62970}They used to swim the|entire Colorado river.
{62971}{63053}Right until the Piscusus epic .
{63054}{63205}I still don't understand|how you found one.
{63209}{63243}Alive!
{63244}{63306}We discovered a subterreanean|lake through a rift,
{63307}{63357}caused by the quake.|- But!
{63358}{63446}How could it survived for so long,
{63447}{63458}cut out from the surface?
{63459}{63524}Cannibalism.
{63525}{63592}They must have fought|each other to survive.
{63593}{63653}Look!
{63682}{63761}All those scars, on her scales.
{63762}{63844}Notice! The eyes.
{63845}{63903}Jesus. Like he's staring back at you.
{63904}{63976}No, no, no! Not staring...
{63977}{64044}sensing!
{64211}{64249}God! Don't do that!
{64250}{64328}Piranhas hunt in packs.
{64329}{64368}Not for protection!
{64369}{64437}But overwhelming force.
{64438}{64534}They're organized, methodical...
{64535}{64597}The first bite draws blood,
{64598}{64670}more blood draws the pack!
{64671}{64718}So how are we going to stop them?
{64719}{64793}Wait. I'm sorry, you're not actually|consider going back out onto the lake?
{64794}{64855}They are killing machines|but they're still fish.
{64856}{64883}You can catch them
{64884}{64950}or kill them!
{64951}{65011}If there really are thousands...
{65012}{65060}Ya?
{65061}{65222}Yesterday would have been|a good time to start.
{66850}{66915}Oh Shit!
{66916}{66957}It's my little brother and sister!
{66958}{67028}Are they waving for help?
{67029}{67069}I don't know. They are supposed|to be at home right now.
{67070}{67104}I'm supposed to be home right now!
{67105}{67137}Jake, jake, jake.
{67138}{67173}What are you doing?! You're|gonna miss my money shot!
{67174}{67213}Okay. It's my family! Alright!
{67214}{67258}They could be in trouble!
{67259}{67302}You are gonna be the one in trouble,
{67303}{67350}if I don't get my flying|catars right now!
{67351}{67483}What the hell's wrong with you man?
{67525}{67609}What's wrong with me?
{67610}{67643}Oh, God dammit! You're missing it.|You're missing it...
{67644}{67725}You're missing the shot!
{67726}{67749}No, no, no...
{67750}{67839}Wow! You missed it!|What is wrong with you?
{67840}{67879}Listen! They are|stranded out there okay!
{67880}{67952}They might need my help.
{67953}{67976}Boobies, boobies...
{67977}{67989}Alright!
{67990}{68022}Listen to me.
{68023}{68124}My mom is the Sheriff.
{68445}{68490}Alright! Let's...

{68513}{68557}Throw the minerals in the boat!
{68558}{68586}It'll be great!
{68587}{68666}It'll be fun.
{69236}{69310}Take me up!
{69553}{69580}Help me!
{69581}{69607}Take me up!
{69608}{69716}What the hell is goin on?
{70632}{70706}Weapons of mass offensive|right over here!

{117347}{117421}You don't understand.
{117422}{117475}The specimen you left with me...

{117625}{117698}What are you talking about?
{117699}{117766}The piranhas that killed those divers...
{117767}{117834}the ones you're hurting for...
{117835}{117890}They are not fully developed.

{118137}{118156}So?
{118157}{118258}Where are the parents?
RED RIDING HOOD
Full moon. Lock up tonight.
Better the wolf takes the pig than you.
We lived on the edge of a dark forest.
Few knew our village by name...
...but many had heard of the terrible things that happened there.
My mother always told me,
"Don't talk to strangers.
Go get water and come straight home."
I tried to be a good girl and do what she said.
Valerie.
Believe me, I tried.
Let's go.
Shh.
Do you have the knife?
Right here.
Look, snow white fur.
I'll make you a pair of hunting boots.
Do it, Peter.
- You do it.
- No, you do it.
That's it.
I know good girls aren't supposed to hunt rabbits or go into the woods alone.
But since we were kids, he always had a way of making me wanna break the rules.
Peter!
Trees'll still be there after we eat.
- Give me that.
- What will you give me for it?
- They didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?
They've arranged for you to marry
Henry Lazar.
Well, my mother finally got what she wanted.
Money.
Henry gets what he's always wanted.
You.
So, what do we do now?
Do you want to marry him?
You know I don't.
Prove it.
- How?
- Run away with me.
Where would we go?
Anywhere you want.
The ocean.
The city.
The mountains.
You afraid?
- No.
- Oh, no?
Really?
You'd leave your home?
Your family?
Your whole life?
I would do anything to be with you.
I thought you'd say that.
- Oh, did you?
- Ha, ha.
Let's do something about it.
It'd be half a day's ride before anyone knows we're gone.
I'll race you.
The wolf.
This way! Over here!
It killed again.
But we've kept the peace.
Well, the wolf has broken it.
Who is it?
Tell me.
It's your sister.
Mother, Father.
Lucie!
Lucie!
Thank you, Claude.
- Madame Lazar, please come in.
- Suzette.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
Let me take that.
- Hello, Henry.
- Ladies.
Lucie was a good girl.
He's your fiancé now.
He's come to offer his condolences.
- But I barely know him.
- You'll get to know him.
Now go down there. Please.
Cesaire.
Come with us to the tavern.
Let the women grieve in their own way.
- I-- I-- I want to go.
- No.
I didn't love your father when we were first married.
I was in love with another man.
But I came to love your father.
And he gave me two beautiful daughters.
We should count our blessings.
Come on, Father.
It's been almost 20 years since the wolf has taken a human life.
Twenty years.
That's because we sacrifice our best livestock every full moon.
We kept our end of the bargain.
- So now we kill it.
- Yeah!
Let's kill that thing!
No.
I've summoned Father Solomon.
- Father Solomon?
- Ha-ha-ha.
He has destroyed werewolves and witches in cities throughout the kingdom.
He will rid us of this beast.
No.
He'll rob us of our vengeance.
I wonder why she was outside on a wolf night.
Maybe she snuck out to meet a boy.
My Lucie never even thought about boys.
She was certainly taken with my grandson.
She used to come by and follow him about like a puppy.
She found out that night that Henry was engaged to her sister.
She must have been heartbroken.
Maybe she chose to die rather than live without him.
How romantic.
Prudence!
It's unspeakable.
She never even told me.
Don't worry, dear.
Henry always had his eye on you.
You're the pretty one.
I'm paying my respects.
I know exactly why you're here.
I've already lost one daughter.
Valerie's all I have left.
You have nothing to offer her.
I have a trade. The same one as your husband.
I know what a woodcutter earns.
Henry's her only hope for a better life.
If you love her...
...you'll let her go.
We've all seen the bones on the trail to Mount Grimmoor.
That's where the wolf makes its lair.
We know the weaknesses of the werewolf.
It can't come out in daylight.
It can't step onto holy ground.
- And there's silver.
- That'll kill it.
Silver!
Maybe Father Auguste is right.
Maybe we should wait.
Coward.
Maybe, my son...
...you should find your courage.
You want to hunt the wolf?
Let's hunt it.
Let's kill it!
Let's kill the beast!
Let's kill it!
What's going on?
Come on, boys!
Are you with me?!
Let's go!
Be careful.
I lost my sister. I can't lose you too.
We can't do this anymore.
You have to go through with it.
You have to marry Henry.
But you know I don't want Henry.
Don't make this something it's not.
Look, we had our fun.
That's all it ever was.
I don't believe you.
I made something for you.
I was gonna wait until our wedding, but, uh....
Just in case.
You will be happy again.
I promise.
Come on, Henry.
We should wait.
- We should wait for Father Solomon.
- No!
He'll be here tomorrow!
- We're gonna kill the wolf.
- We can take care of this.
That's it? Nobody else?
Let's go! Go home to your mama's, then.
Adrian. Thank you for standing up for
Lucie. That was no small thing.
We'll be family soon.
You'd have done the same.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Don't worry.
The wolf doesn't want me. I'm all gristle.
I mean it, son.
I promise, Mama.
Grandmother.
Oh.
Darling. Darling.
Come.
Careful.
There are so many things she didn't tell me.
And I'm her sister. I should've known.
That was her choice.
We all have secrets.
Remember what my grandma used to say:
- "All sorrows are less with bread."
- "Less with bread."
Here. Try this.
How beautiful.
I was making it for your wedding.
I don't feel like it's my wedding.
I feel like...
...I'm being sold.
Right up there.
You better watch yourself.
There's a fork.
Let's split up.
Another fork.
We'll take the steep one.
No. We should stay together.
Good morning, dear.
Morning, Grandmother.
Grandmother told us that the wolf used to kill entire families...
...snatching children from their beds.
Those stories never seemed real to me.
Until now.
Ripped the thing out!
Claude.
To Adrian.
For his sacrifice.
To Adrian.
Poor Henry.
Henry.
Your father was a brave man.
You know,
I was close enough to smell it.
And I was afraid. And I hid from it.
I didn't do anything.
I should've saved him.
- Henry--
- Just leave!
I don't want you to see me like this.
It was Henry's father, wasn't it?
The man you loved?
Lucie was in love with him.
She was a year older than me.
She could've married him.
Why did you insist it was me?
I think you know the answer to that.
I want you to say it.
Lucie was Henry's half-sister.
Adrian was her father.
Does Papa know about Lucie?
No. And you have to promise me that you'll never tell.
Father Solomon.
He's here.
Claude.
Presenting His Eminence....
Father Solomon.
Papa.
Oh, please don't cry.
You see? You see all these children?
You see how scared they are?
There's a big, bad wolf.
Someone has to stop it.
Is that the beast that killed our mother?
It may very well be.
Go on. I'll join you soon.
No.
Go.
This is indeed an honor, Your Eminence.
Welcome. You've arrived just in time for our festival.
As you can see, the werewolf has been dealt with.
That is not a werewolf.
No disrespect...
...but we have been living with this beast for two generations.
We know what we're dealing with.
Well, no disrespect...
...but you have no idea what you are dealing with.
I was like you once.
My wife's name was Penelope.
She gave me two beautiful daughters.
We were a very happy family.
We lived in a village like this.
And like Daggerhorn...
...ours was plagued by a werewolf.
One full moon, my friends and I got drunk.
We decided to hunt it.
It never occurred to us that we might actually find it, but find it we did.
It ripped...
...my best friend in half.
Quickly.
And then it was on me.
I hacked and hacked at it with my axe.
Suddenly...
...it was gone.
I had cut off one of its front paws.
I thought it might make a clever souvenir, and so I took it home.
And there I found my wife...
...with a bloody rag wrapped around her wrist.
And when I opened my sack...
...the werewolf's paw...
...was gone.
This was in its place.
I told my girls the werewolf killed their mother.
But that was a lie.
I killed her.
When a werewolf dies, it returns to its human form.
That is just a common gray wolf.
Your werewolf...
...is still very much alive.
This is one of only three silver swords blessed by the Holy See.
May I touch?
No.
This is a very dangerous time.
You all know what the Blood Moon means.
They have no idea what it means.
The orrery.
The red planet converges with the moon once every 13 years.
This is the only time a new werewolf can be created.
During the week of the Blood Moon...
...the werewolf may pass his curse on with a single bite.
During a normal full moon, a wolf bite will kill you.
But during a Blood Moon...
...your very souls are in danger.
Until the Blood Moon wanes in three days...
...you will never truly be safe.
We're safe now.
I killed the wolf in its lair.
The cave at Mount Grimmoor.
You have been deceived by this beast from the start.
It made you think it lived on Grimmoor...
...so that you would not look for it in the most obvious place.
The wolf lives here.
In this village.
Among you.
The real killer could be your neighbor.
- What?
- Your best friend.
Even your wife.
- Barricade the village.
- You can't do that!
Post men at every gate!
No one leaves until we kill the wolf!
- As you wish.
- The wolf is dead.
Tonight we celebrate!
Yes!
Go ahead. Celebrate.
We'll see who is right.
The wolf is dead!
Take it off!
I'll huff, and I'll puff...
...and I'll blow your house down!
Laugh at the little man!
Valerie, come dance.
I'll huff...
...I'll puff...
...and I'll blow your house down.
Ow!
I'll just flick this off.
I'll be fit to see the pope.
Papa.
You're my good girl.
I'm so sorry.
I know. Just go home now, okay?
Tricked you. Ha-ha-ha.
Impressive.
Where did you learn that?
Claude.
Claude, come back to the party.
Looks like Rose has a new conquest.
Come on, Prudence.
You left us!
Take it easy, friend.
I said we should stick together and you left us, and my father is dead because of it!
Please don't do this.
Keep your hands off her or I'll cut them off!
Peter.
Leave me alone.
What's the matter with you?
What do I have to do to make you stop?
I love you, Peter.
What are you doing with Rose?
You don't even like her.
I don't have to like her to get what I want from her.
You're a terrible liar.
I know you feel like I do.
I know you're burning inside.
I'll never be able to give you anything like this.
Think I care about Henry's money?
You have a future with him.
I'm not gonna let you ruin that.
Did my mother get to you?
Valerie, I'm wrong for you.
I don't care.
I could eat you up.
Don't you want me?
Hey, Peter.
Come on, give us a hand.
The only life I want is with you.
So where did you disappear to?
You know all that soft hay in the granary?
- Run!
- Get to the church!
- Peter!
- Go!
Claude!
You will die now, beast!
The wolf can't cross onto holy ground!
Get to the church!
The church!
Claude!
Now! Rope it!
Hold him!
Claude!
- It's strong.
- God is stronger.
God is stronger!
I warned you!
I warned you!
Your werewolf is still alive!
Find it!
Find it!
Find it.
Over there!
You can't escape from me.
Oh, my God. You can speak.
How?
You understand me.
That's all that matters, Valerie.
You know my name.
What are you doing?
Human eyes, dark brown.
I know you well.
You dream of leaving this village.
Let me take you away.
You and I are the same.
No, I'm nothing like you.
You're a murderer.
You're a killer too, aren't you?
What happened to the rabbit, Valerie?
I killed it.
I know. So come with me.
No.
Then the streets will run red with blood. Starting with hers.
Come on!
Father Solomon will stop you.
Father Solomon will die like the rest.
I'm coming back for you before the Blood Moon wanes.
There! Fire!
You talked to the wolf.
No, it talked to us.
No, it growled.
Wait, you heard it talk to you?
They'll call me a witch.
Don't tell anyone.
No, of course not.
- Get inside onto holy ground.
- Wait, I have to find my brother.
- And my family.
- No one leaves until sunrise.
- Go.
- For your own safety.
We were wrong to have doubted you,
Father.
I've never seen a beast as strong as this.
A creature this powerful must come from a long uninterrupted bloodline.
Each generation more potent than the one before.
We must find it in its human form.
But how? It could be any of them.
It hasn't survived this long by being obvious. Look everywhere.
Look for the signs.
Isolation.
Witchcraft.
The black arts.
Abnormal behavior.
Strange smells.
Your homes will be searched.
Your secrets brought to light.
If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear.
But if you are guilty...
...I swear by Almighty God...
...you will be destroyed.
He's still alive!
Bring me water!
Hurry!
It's a Blood Moon. So he must--
He's my brother!
A man bitten...
...is a man cursed!
Valerie, open the door.
We're all in danger.
So we've gotta leave now.
Come away with me.
Come away with me.
Come away with me.
Get your things. We have to leave now.
I can't go with you, Peter.
Why not?
I'm sorry.
What happened?
She's going to be all right.
The wolf just scratched her.
That's not a bite.
Lift her head, Valerie.
Here. Drink this, dear.
It'll help you sleep.
You sleep.
What is it, darling?
What is it?
The wolf.
It talked to me.
And you understood it?
As clearly as I understand you.
Have you told anyone else about this?
Only Roxanne knows, but she won't tell anyone.
She won't even talk to me about it.
It chose not to kill you.
I think it wants me alive.
- No.
- Bring me another bandage.
No.
I have to get clean water.
Has Claude come home?
Nobody's seen him.
There you go, back inside. Now.
You have to let us in.
I saw you with Peter.
I know you don't want me like that.
I'm not gonna force you to marry me.
I'm gonna break off the engagement.
I'm sorry, Henry.
That's enough!
Father Solomon! We found someone hiding!
In the tower!
Quickly!
- It's my brother! Don't touch him!
- Get him down!
- Interrogate him!
- He's not the wolf!
Look at him!
His speech is twisted.
He communes with demons.
Get him down! Now!
He hasn't done anything!
This is proof that he studies the black arts!
He's a conjurer.
- I know him.
- Better than I knew my own wife?
You never know what someone is capable of.
Get him down! Come on!
Give me the name of the wolf.
Give me the name.
Tell me the name!
The Romans invented this.
An ingenious system for extracting the truth.
How can he give you a name?
The boy can barely speak.
Listen to how he sings of his love of Satan.
We do this for the greater good.
What's the good in this?
I killed my wife to protect my children.
Our methods of pleasing God are sometimes flawed.
You had best develop a stomach for it.
She says it's important.
I've come to bargain for the release of my brother.
Silver fingernails.
To kill a werewolf.
Get out.
Please, I have more than money to offer.
Turn around.
Enough. Move.
Wait, please. I have something else.
Spare my brother and I'll give you the name of a witch.
Now, that...
...is worth something.
Tell them what you told me.
She can climb the tallest trees.
She can run faster than all the girls.
She wears a red cloak.
The devil's color.
That's nonsense. I made that cloak.
Silence! Continue.
And she can talk to werewolves.
I've seen it. With my own eyes.
- Do you deny it?
- No, I don't deny it.
And what was the nature of this conversation?
It promised to leave Daggerhorn in peace as long as I go with it.
The wolf is someone in this village who wants you, Valerie.
Do you know who it is?
I'd think very hard if I were you.
Tell me.
Tell me who it is.
Give me a name.
It wants her, not you.
If you wish to save yourselves, simply give it what it wants.
You can't give her to the wolf.
That's human sacrifice.
We've all made sacrifices.
The trial is over.
Go back to your homes.
I said go home. All of you!
- I thought you cared about her.
- I do care.
I do care.
I'm trying to be smart about it.
Go to the granary.
You're gonna try and rescue her?
- Well, I'll help.
- I'm not that desperate.
Oh, really? Then what's your plan, huh?
See, you don't have one.
Look, you've seen those locks.
I've got a shop and I've got tools.
You need me.
Okay. Fine.
But if you're the wolf,
I'm gonna chop your head off.
I will do the same to you.
Fair enough.
Go home!
Where's my brother? Father Solomon told me you'd release him.
We did.
Grandma.
Bread. Blanket.
Do you need anything else?
I do not want you to use that knife.
- We have to find the wolf.
- By sundown?
Listen, the wolf wants you.
But first it killed your sister.
No. I didn't know it, but Lucie was in love with Henry.
And when she found out about my engagement...
...she gave herself to the wolf.
No. Lucie wouldn't do that.
- Your time is up.
- But she might have responded to Henry.
Please see that she gets that.
Oaf.
Cesaire.
I'm gonna save your daughter.
And then I intend to marry her.
I'd like your blessing in this, but I can live without it.
What can I do?
We're closed.
It's me.
Hello, Henry.
- I brought you some biscuits.
- Thanks.
I just wanna thank you for speaking up this morning.
Here, try some.
Yes.
That was very brave of you.
I said what I felt.
You know...
...I want you to know you're under no obligation to stand up for Valerie.
You're no longer engaged to her.
She's in love with someone else.
That doesn't mean
I've stopped caring about her.
I imagine that's just how
Lucie felt about you.
She had a crush on me.
Oh, more than a crush. I think she would have done absolutely anything for you.
Even agree to meet you on a wolf night if you asked her to.
Why are you doing this?
Do you think I'm the wolf?
Are you accusing me of murder?
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I just want to find out the truth.
It's you.
My God, it's you.
I can smell it on you.
Heh. What can you smell on me?
The night my father died, I could smell the wolf. It was like a deep musk.
And I can smell it all over you right now.
What do you do out there in that cabin all by yourself in the middle of the night?
On the night that Lucie died?
You don't know, do you?
I know what you're doing. And I'm not gonna let you turn this on me.
Oh.
You're coming with us.
- I haven't done anything.
- Just a precaution.
Father Solomon doesn't want any trouble from the witch's family.
It's time to put on your harlot's robe.
Valerie.
I did my best to protect you.
You and Lucie.
I know, Papa.
You taught us to be strong.
Father Solomon had designed the mask for public disgrace.
And even my friends stared, judging me.
Stop.
What if they were right?
Maybe the wolf knew something I didn't.
Maybe there was something dark inside of me.
You should all go home!
I'm so sorry, Valerie.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
Bless you, my dear.
Prudence.
Valerie?
Roxanne wanted me to tell you how sorry she is.
- She said those things to save her brother.
- I know. Tell her that I forgive her.
Of course.
But I wanted to say....
I don't know what to say.
But you don't have to say anything.
But I want to.
I want you to know that...
...you may have fooled Roxanne...
...but you don't fool me.
Not anymore.
You were always too good.
Too pretty.
Too perfect.
You tricked us.
Now you're gonna get what you deserve.
Prudence, I think you should go.
Yes.
It won't be long now.
The wolf is coming.
The wolf lives here.
Your neighbor. Your best friend.
Even your wife.
You're the pretty one.
- I could eat you up.
- You will be happy again.
Human eyes, dark brown.
I know you well.
Do you know how you kill a tiger,
Father Auguste?
You tie out your best goat...
...and wait.
Fire!
- Put it out!
- Unh.
Go!
I'm gonna get you out of here.
It's too much!
Don't move.
There! He's taken the bait! Fire!
Wait, that's not the wolf!
He's aiding a witch!
- Fire!
- No!
Run!
Run.
This one started the fire.
Lock him up. In the elephant!
- Go!
- Move it!
The witch has escaped!
Get over here! Find the witch!
Come on, Peter's meeting us with the horses.
Valerie!
Valerie!
Where's Peter?
I don't know.
He said he'd be here.
If he doesn't show...
...I'm gonna take you away.
Let me take you away.
Do you think I'm the wolf?
Find the witch!
Come on! Quickly!
Go.
That way!
We should go to the church.
The wolf can't cross onto holy ground.
Some with me! This way! Let's go!
I heard something over there.
They're in here! After them!
Valerie.
Henry. Henry.
Go. Valerie, go!
No. I'm not leaving you.
- We claim sanctuary.
- You are not on holy ground yet.
- This...
- Unh.
...belongs to me.
You want her alive?!
Kill it!
Valerie.
Step across the gate, or I'll destroy this village.
Come with me before the sun rises.
Make your decision.
I won't let you destroy my home.
- I'll go with you.
- Don't! Valerie. No.
If you promise to leave them alone.
No. I won't let you sacrifice yourself for us.
- Nor will I.
- Nor will I.
I stand by Valerie.
You can't hide from me.
- Aah!
- The witch will still burn!
Under the Blood Moon...
...a man bitten is a man cursed.
My children will be orphaned.
My brother...
...had children too.
I meant only to serve.
To protect us from darkness.
Under the Blood Moon...
...a man bitten is a man cursed.
Where's Peter?
Where's Peter?
Grandmother.
What big eyes you have.
The better to see you with, my dear.
Grandmother, what big ears you have.
The better to hear you with, my dear.
What big teeth you have.
The better to eat you with, my dear.
Valerie. What are you doing out of bed?
I was so worried.
It looks much better.
Where are you going?
To Grandmother's.
I think she's in danger.
We're going after the wolf before the storm can cover its tracks.
It'll be human again and we can finally kill it.
And I have....
What? Tell me.
Peter is still missing.
I'll do what I have to do.
Please be careful.
Valerie.
Thank God you're all right.
Where were you?
I was trapped in that brazen beast all night.
I finally broke out.
Don't come near me.
Valerie, what?
You don't believe me?
I'll hurt you.
No, you won't.
Please don't.
Grandmother!
Grandmother, are you all right?
I had a nightmare.
- Ah!
- I'm fine.
I just woke up.
There's some soup if you're hungry.
I think the wolf is out there.
It's all right, darling.
We're safe in here.
Eat up. Remember:
- "All sorrows are less with bread."
- "Less with bread."
That's right.
Eat up, my dear.
What is this?
Father, what are you doing here?
Where's Grandmother?
I had no choice.
She finally realized what I am.
How could you do this?
Sit down.
Sit down.
Oh, Valerie.
I've been so disrespected.
I've settled for far less than I deserve.
So I decided I'd leave.
For the city.
For richer hunting grounds.
Why didn't you just leave?
Because I loved you girls.
I wanted you to come with me.
- But you had to wait for the Blood Moon.
- Yes.
By birthright...
...the gift would go first to my eldest daughter.
So I forged a letter.
But when I tried to speak to her--
Henry's not coming, Lucie.
--She didn't understand me.
Any offspring of mine with my wolf blood would've been able to do so.
And then it all made sense.
Lucie couldn't be my daughter.
Your mother lied to me.
But you knew that already, didn't you?
After all these years of being so clever and so careful, I just lost control.
I'm sorry for Lucie.
You took revenge on Mother.
And her lover.
Henry smelled the wolf that night.
And then again yesterday.
He thought the smell came from your grandmother.
But she had lived with that smell her whole life.
You see, my father was a wolf too.
The smell remained on his clothing.
Mother never knew what it meant...
...till the moment she died.
I loved her.
Her and Lucie both.
I never wanted to hurt them.
Valerie, come with me.
It's the last day of the Blood Moon.
One bite, and you'll be like me.
I won't do what you do.
I can't.
Yes, you can, Valerie.
My blood already courses through your veins.
It's a gift.
It's a gift my father gave to me that now I can give to you.
I'm stronger than he was, you'll be even stronger than me.
Think about it.
We will be invincible.
There must be a God, because you're the devil.
And you're the devil's daughter.
You're not so terrifying when the sun is up.
How would you know?
Papa!
I have something for you.
Peter.
Get me out of here.
Ow.
He bit me.
When the moon rises...
...I'll be like him.
A beast.
Everything I knew was ripped apart.
I saw it all differently.
All the lies. My mother's, my father's.
He was all I had left.
Peter.
Even when I doubted him...
...even when I wounded him...
...Peter was true.
I'm so sorry.
No one can know about your father.
They'll hang you...
...for being the daughter of the wolf.
Peter.
I have to leave.
You won't be safe with me...
...until I learn how to protect you from....
I'll wait for you.
I thought you'd say that.
It was the most brutal winter
I could remember.
With time, my mother finally realized that Father would never return.
Henry found his courage.
He chose a life of honor, protecting us from darkness.
Daggerhorn fell back into its old rhythms.
The wolf didn't come back.
But the village still lived in fear.
It was the only life they knew.
I could no longer live there.
I felt more freedom in the shadows of the forest.
To live apart carries its own dangers.
But of those...
...I am less afraid.
Valerie.

THE RITE
Don't be afraid.
Do you believe in sin?
There's nothing to believe.
"The battle against the Devil,
which is the principal task of Saint Michael the Archangel,
is still being fought today,
because the Devil is still alive and active in the world." - Pope John Paul II
What follows is inspired by true events.
- You finished?
- Yep.
Then wash up and come eat.
I've washed up.
Well, then eat.
And when you're done,
I'll need a hand with the casket.
How'd she do it?
What?
Kill herself.
Michael, I've told you this many times.
We serve the dead, but we don't talk about them.
It brings bad things.
We keep dead people in the house, Dad.
How much worse could it get?
- Are you kidding me?
- No, Eddie. I'm not kidding.
Wait, why?
So I can get out of here.
Why not tell him you wanna go to college?
I mean, you got the grades. You can do it.
- You think he'd pay for that?
- Shit, man. Seminary school?
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Seminary school, really?
Wait, is this your way of telling me you're gay? I'm just joking. Okay? Joking.
Man, you don't get it. In my family, you're either a mortician or a priest. That's it.
Well, then change your name.
It's too late. I took the entrance exam.
- You what?
- I passed.
I'm leaving Monday.
That's... That's crazy.
Dude, I've looked into it.
It's a four-year degree before you even take your first vows.
If it doesn't work out, I can always leave.
Wow. Such faith.
You know what, Eddie?
You're such a dick.
Cool. Awesome. Whatever, dude.
I will never confess to you.
You know that, right?
These are on the house.
- Wow.
- Gonna get heat for giving away beers?
Not if they don't know.
How about for banging the customers?
Screw you, Eddie.
Drink up. I'm off in 10.
Lickety-split.
"Lickety-split"? Pbbb.
You better make the most of that before they chop your wiener off.
Goodbye, wiener.
Don't worry.
The pain is gone.
God has taken it...
...away.
Michael. Come.
Don't be afraid.
Four years later
This is always a special Mass for me...
...as I look upon our new deacons...
...as they prepare to go into the world with Christ's message.
So in the next few months, you will face your last assessments...
...and then be asked to take your final vows to become priests.
So I leave you with these words to consider, from the Gospel of Saint John:
You did not choose me...
...it was I who chose you...
...and I send you forth to bear fruit that will last.
Michael.
Exam results.
You aced psychology.
- Art history too. Congratulations.
- Thank you.
So, what happened with theology?
It's like you blew it on purpose.
I've been distracted.
End of the year, that's all.
Drop by my office this week.
We'll discuss it.
Okay.
Yeah, jump. Take him out.
Dude, honestly?
Michael!
Michael, wait!
Call an ambulance!
Bless me, Father.
Father.
Bless me.
Please, Father.
I don't wanna die like this.
Uh, through the power vested in me:
Let the fire of the Holy Spirit descend, that this being may be awakened...
...in the world beyond the life of this earth...
...and infused with the power of the Holy Spirit.
Lord Jesus Christ, I ask that you receive this child...
What's your name?
Sandra.
I ask you to receive this child,
Sandra, into your loving arms...
...that she might pass in safety from this crisis...
...as you have taught us with infinite passion.
By this sign, you are anointed with the grace of the atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ...
...and absolved of all past error and freed to take your place...
...in the world he has prepared for us.
Amen.
Michael.
I still don't even understand how it happened.
You shouldn't think about it.
It was an accident. Really.
It's hard not to think about.
I feel somewhat responsible.
You know the average age of a nun these days?
Sixty-nine.
Three thousand parishes across the U.S. don't even have a priest anymore.
You give this speech to everyone who tries to leave?
No, just those I believe in.
I quit smoking and now I'm addicted to these.
You know, what I saw the other night, it was really something.
I know experienced priests who wouldn't have handled that.
I just repeated a few prayers over a suffering girl.
And the words meant nothing to you?
Father, listen to me, did you understand my letter?
Yes, I decided not to pass it on to my superiors.
- Why not?
- I think you're making a mistake.
I think this is the part where I say, "It's not you, it's me, let's just be friends."
Here's the thing.
Tastes like shit.
If a seminarian doesn't complete his vows, then under Article 15...
...the Church has the right to convert the scholarship to a student loan.
That's over 100 grand of education you'd owe us.
Why would you do that?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not saying I'm going to do it...
...just yet.
You were a mortician before you joined us, am I right?
I imagine that means you're not very squeamish.
What is this about?
Last year, the Vatican received over a half a million reports of demonic possession.
- That's something of a record.
- I'm still not following.
An order has been passed down...
...to place an exorcist in every diocese across the U.S. by this time next year.
As you might imagine, it's not a highly sought-after position.
There's a new program at the Vatican...
...designed to reteach the clergy the rite of exorcism.
I've been asked to keep an eye out for potential candidates.
Wait a minute, you...
You want me to be an exorcist?
Why?
Why would you want me?
I don't know what I believe in.
That's right.
I remember in your letter...
...you explained how you used the priesthood to run away from things.
The truth is, you could have run in any direction, but you ran here.
Why?
Just take the course.
And then if you still wanna leave when you get back, we can talk about it then.
Two months in Rome.
How bad could that be?
Keep the change. Thank you.
I'm guessing there's no cable.
By the time an exorcist is called to assess a possible possession...
...the parish priest would have ensured...
...that all psychiatric explanations had been exhausted.
He would have questioned the possessed himself...
...and forwarded his assessment on to his bishop.
With the bishop's permission...
...an exorcist is then summoned to determine possession.
Often, early signs of a possession are subtle.
Social withdrawal...
...apathy...
...a persistent tremor in a limb.
It can go unnoticed until the victim is deep within...
...the demonic spirit's grasp.
This was taken at an exorcism in Turin.
The woman survived without food or water for eight weeks...
...before the demon released her.
This man's jaw spontaneously dislocated while being read the Lord's Prayer.
He made no physical contact with any object...
...nor was he met with any physical force.
Demons are the devil's foot soldiers...
...often operating in groups much like a squadron...
...infesting their victims.
It is the job of an exorcist...
...to determine the number of possessing demons and their names...
...something the demons protect with great ferocity.
And when the exorcist has a name...
...he can then begin to assert control over the entity...
...and cast it out.
Who have we here?
- Michael Kovak.
- I'm sorry?
Michael Kovak.
Oh, yes.
The American.
- Yeah. Sorry I'm late.
- Yes, I prefer punctuality to apologies.
Welcome. Sit down.
Die, priest, die!
The most identifiable sign of a possession...
...is the negative reaction to sacred objects.
Crucifixes, holy water.
The man that you have just heard...
...was reacting to a crucifix placed on his head.
- Excuse me, Father.
- Yes?
What if he was suffering from the delusion that he's possessed?
Wouldn't he react in the same way?
Admittedly, it's very easy to confuse psychotic illness with possession.
It's up to the exorcist to discern the difference.
So how do you do that?
Well, there are many ways.
For example, paranoid schizophrenics are not aware that they're deluded.
Neither are the possessed while they're being possessed, are they?
But people who are possessed have periods of lucidity. That's my point.
So do schizophrenics.
One can't suddenly manifest abilities simply because one is deluded.
The man on this tape is German.
How does he spontaneously speak Russian?
How could a boy in a village in Africa found 400 miles from his home...
...claim that he was abducted by aliens?
It's just as unlikely.
But we're willing to call him crazy and your German man not...
...because he believes in aliens, not God.
We're not here to scrutinize religion with science.
The object of this course is to view phenomena through the lens of faith.
So which do you believe in, aliens or God?
The jury's out on both.
Interesting perspective for a priest.
I'm not a priest...
...yet.
So you're having a final fling with atheism?
Well, I guess it's more like an ex-girlfriend who keeps coming around.
Angelina.
We are going to the library.
Are you joining us?
Thank you, gentlemen. See you at Mass.
Michael. Walk with me a moment.
I understand you were taught by Father Matthew.
That's right.
He's a dear friend.
We studied together at Loyola.
He's asked me to keep an eye on you.
He thinks you've got great potential.
That's a lot of pressure.
For both of us.
What do you think of the course so far?
To be honest, I don't know what to make of it.
I suspected as much.
Tell me, Michael, do you believe in sin?
Yeah, I just don't necessarily believe the devil makes us do it.
He that committeth sin is of the devil.
Then that'd be all of us, wouldn't it?
And if we're all of the devil, how do we fight him?
Tomorrow, I recommend you take your doubts for a walk around Rome.
You can pay a visit to an old friend of mine.
Father Lucas?
He's Welsh. Jesuit.
His methods are a little less orthodox.
Studied under
Father Carmine De Filippis.
- I don't know what that means.
- It means he knows his stuff.
He'll be happy to provide you with the kind of proof you seem to need.
Excuse me, I have a Mass to say.
Jesus.
- Father Lucas?
- Yes?
Hi. I'm Michael Kovak.
- Oh. You're the American.
- Yeah.
- You don't like cats?
- Not particularly.
Welcome to Rome.
It's infested with cats.
I've tried giving them names but it's pointless.
A cat won't come no matter what you call it. They do as they please.
Anyway, welcome.
Make sure they don't come in.
No. Hey, hey.
Father Xavier tells me you're troubled.
I don't think Father Xavier explained the situation.
He explained it well enough.
I've arranged for you to meet someone.
Speak of the devil.
God bless you, Father, thank you for seeing us.
There's no need to thank me.
Put it in the kitchen.
Sit down.
Have you fed them?
No, they don't need feeding.
Lucia. Gabriella. Dante. Federico.
Where's Hermione?
Come now.
No. I want to see Hermione.
After. Come.
If you wanna watch, you have to help me. I'll need to absolve you first.
Help with what?
The exorcism. What do you think?
Or you can stay down here with her aunt.
That could be fun.
It's up to you.
Whatever you do, don't address the girl directly, no matter what she says.
And if I ask you to hold her down...
...it's best you grab her arms from behind...
...and try keeping her in a seated position.
The spirit is pretty devious.
Hasn't shown itself yet.
- The spirit?
- Yes. Spirit.
Demon. The devil.
If it hasn't shown itself, how do you know she's possessed?
All right, give me something, anything that's yours.
Put it in this.
What is it, a dollar bill?
Come on, do it. Quickly.
It's for your benefit.
What else?
Oh, yes. It's Michael, isn't it?
I absolve you of any sins you may have committed now or in the past...
...in the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.
- Amen.
- All right, come on.
Oh, yes, one other thing. If it does manifest, don't even look into the girl's eyes.
Whatever you do, do not address it.
Do not speak to it. It's the devil.
- Leave that to me. Do you understand?
- Cool.
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, I get it.
Well, just say so.
Bow your head, keep praying and good luck.
How are you?
The same.
Have you eaten?
What about your baby?
You need to eat.
Okay.
Um...
What's happened since Tuesday?
It won't stop now.
Even when I sleep it talks.
Okay.
Now she's gonna guess what's in the bag.
Rosaria?
See the bag?
Tell me what's in it.
How could I know that?
Then I want you to guess.
I don't know.
Clear your mind and guess.
It's not a test. Just guess.
I don't want to.
I'm ordering you to guess! Guess!
Show her.
There you are.
Knowledge of the unknowable.
It's the quickest test for possession.
The devil is working in and through her right now.
Okay.
Uh...
Did it tell you what was in the bag?
Is it talking now?
What's it saying?
Disgusting things.
It's important you tell me.
Has it told you its name yet?
Do you know its name?
Tell me its name.
Tell me now.
In!
I can't talk now,
I'm in the middle of something.
Shut up, shut up.
Shut up, priest.
You must not touch me.
You are disgusting.
Keep your dirty hands off me.
Shut up! You must not speak.
Don't touch me!
Go away, priest. Go away!
You stink, you are disgusting.
Rosaria.
Rosaria.
Open your mouth.
How do you feel?
Okay.
Okay, that's it.
Really? That's it?
Well, what'd you expect?
Spinning heads, pea soup?
Spiritual liberation can take months, sometimes years.
So she's still possessed?
Yeah.
I know you don't believe me, but...
Tell me...
...does a thief or a burglar turn on the lights when he's robbing your house? No.
He prefers you to believe that he's not there.
Like the devil. He prefers you to believe that he doesn't exist.
It gets complicated when no proof of the devil is somehow proof of the devil.
Yeah.
The interesting thing about skeptics, atheists...
...is that we're always looking for proof, certainty.
The question is, what on earth would we do if we found it?
- "We"?
- Oh, yes.
There are times when I experience a total loss of faith.
Days, months when I don't know what the hell I believe in.
God or the devil,
Santa Claus or Tinker Bell.
But...
...you know, I'm just a man.
I'm a weak man. I have...
...no power.
Yet there's something that keeps digging and scraping away inside me.
Feels like God's fingernail.
And finally I can take no more of the pain...
...and I get shoved out from the darkness...
...back into the light.
Something like that.
Anyway, enough philosophizing for one day.
If you have any more questions, you know where to find me.
I got my eye on you. What you doing?
You're in Rome and you go to McDonald's?
Oh, hey.
Come on. Let me buy you an Italian coffee.
Where were you today?
Xavier kicked you out, didn't he?
Yeah, I've plea-bargained down from being burned at the stake.
So you're just vacationing now on the Church's dime?
Yeah, and yours.
Seriously, why are you taking the course?
Why are you?
Are they recruiting nuns for exorcists?
"Nuns"?
I'm sorry, I just naturally assumed...
Yeah, naturally.
Well, if you're not a nun, why are you taking the course?
I'm a journalist. I'm covering the course for an article.
I see. And I thought you were just buying me a coffee.
There's a lot of interest in this.
A lot of debate.
Look...
...I know you saw Father Lucas today.
I've been trying to get an interview with him, but he's been reluctant.
What is it you want?
- I'd love to know what you saw.
- You're asking me to spy?
No, I'm asking you to report your own experiences.
Listen...
...I'm just interested in the truth.
Seems like you are too.
Just as there is a hierarchy of angels, ranked in ascendant order...
...so, too, is the realm of evil ranked.
And just as each angel has a name...
...so, too, does every demon.
Beelzebub, Leviathan, Ba'al.
These are some of the names we look for...
...when performing an exorcism.
Just bear with me for a moment.
Well, I think we should leave it there and pick it up tomorrow. Thank you.
Michael, how's my old friend Lucas?
He's unorthodox.
No exorcism is orthodox.
He's treating a pregnant girl that I believe needs psychiatric care.
You believe?
Father Lucas has been doing this longer than anyone I know.
I'm telling you because I'm concerned.
It's not uncommon...
...to be overly concerned for the subject in one's first exorcism.
You have to see that it is the demon that's in pain.
Trust me. Father Lucas gets results.
At what cost?
Oh. What can I do for you?
Rosaria.
You remember this man?
He was sent by the Vatican.
I want you to answer his questions.
Hi.
It was terrible to see you go through your suffering.
This is unimportant. Just nod.
Do you remember any of it?
He wants to know if you remember things when the devil takes over your body.
She says it's like a dream or a nightmare.
This is yours, yes?
Do you know how it got in my pocket?
Did you put it in his pocket?
Tell the truth now.
It wasn't me.
Then who was it?
Rosaria, who was it?
The devil?
Why would she lie?
- She's 16.
- Yes.
And she's pregnant.
Who's the father of her child?
She won't say.
Ask her who gave her the bracelet, please.
- Her father.
- And where is he now?
- He's gone away. He left the family.
- When?
Oh, I don't know.
A few months ago, I believe.
- What are you doing?
- I'm giving it back to her.
Remember the fat little bitch?
Killed herself.
She says to say hello.
Hell-o.
In the name of Jesus Christ, name yourself.
In the name of Jesus Christ, name yourself.
By the authority of Jesus Christ,
I command you to declare yourself!
By the authority of Jesus Christ,
I command you to declare yourself now!
We are the fruit of her womb.
Speak the truth, in the name of Jesus Christ.
Speak the truth, in the name of Jesus Christ.
We're strong in the Lord and the power of his might!
In the name of Judas Cross.
Demon, name yourself.
Your name, demon! Your name!
Tremble before the Lord!
We're strong in the Lord and the power of his might!
Now!
By the authority of Jesus Christ,
I command you to...
Hold her!
Help me. Help me.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women...
Shit on your Holy Spirit!
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High...
...shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. He is my refuge...
...my fortress and my strength.
He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler...
Rape me.
...my fortress and my strength.
Lickety-split.
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow...
...nor for the destruction that wasteth.
A thousand shall fall...
...and 10,000 at thy right hand...
Father, please.
Don't let it hurt my baby.
They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Take it out!
Shit it out and eat it!
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those...
Help me.
You...
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Go to hell, priest!
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners...
...now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
- Hail Mary, full of grace.
- She's choking. Father.
Pray with me! Out!
And begone, you unclean spirits of terror and darkness. Out!
Damned Legion, Satan, Lucifer, out!
Begone! We banish you, we cast you out...
...in the name of the Virgin Mary, mother of Christ, the son of the living God...
...in whom we live, and move, and have our being.
Who lives in us and reigns in us supreme.
We cast you out from the nothingness and the darkness...
...from whence you came.
Out, demon! Out, Lucifer! Out, Satan!
Now! Begone! In the name of the Holy Spirit.
Deliver this from the snare of the fowler, from the pestilence...
...from the darkness.
Well, she's asleep.
She needs to rest.
So I'll send her home in a few days so she can recover.
I thought you were required to have a doctor present.
I am a doctor.
Has she seen a psychiatrist?
- Yeah.
- What happened?
Oh, she doesn't respond to treatment.
- Is she on antidepressants?
- No.
- No, she's pregnant.
- So she hasn't been medically treated?
Yeah. I'm looking after her.
Weren't you concerned for her health up there?
Yeah, of course I was.
Well, how will her baby survive this?
See, it's very difficult to predict how any of this stuff is gonna work out.
- Have you ever lost a patient?
- Yeah.
Yeah, a boy I once treated.
He was about 15 years of age...
...and he committed suicide...
...and I was depressed for a few months...
...and I started to doubt everything
I believed in.
And I thought the devil had defeated me.
Don't you think she should see a psychiatrist again?
You're still not convinced...
Oh, Christ! She was raped by her father.
She's internalizing her guilt.
"Internalizing"? Okay.
Still doesn't explain everything, does it?
It doesn't explain how she started to speak English.
Well, she's a teenager. She's listened to a thousand songs on the radio.
What about these nails?
It could be that she swallowed them to hurt the baby.
She clearly doesn't want it.
What about the voice inside her? That wasn't a human voice, though, was it?
You be careful, Michael.
Why?
Choosing not to believe in the devil won't protect you from him.
Michael.
Come.
Come closer.
You're not a coward. Don't be afraid.
It's just your mother.
Now...
...blow.
We want to do a good job, don't we?
The best we can.
Good. Now...
...pray.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb...
My love.
My flower.
Mother of God, pray for us sinners...
My beautiful.
Amen.
Can't get enough, huh?
Doing house calls today.
Take that, it's gonna rain.
Shut the gate after you.
Vincenzo.
What happens in your dream?
I'm being hurt.
By what?
A mule.
With red eyes.
It kicks me.
And bites me.
And do you try and run away?
Why not?
Because he says he's my father and I must obey him.
Oh.
What else does he tell you?
He tells me...
...to kill myself.
Show him.
He woke up with these.
The mule from the dream?
Vincenzo?
The mule in the dream?
Mama?
Not Mama?
You hit him?
Are you lying?
Are you a liar?
Okay.
Come here.
Open your mouth.
Ahh.
Bring me his pillow.
Banish all the forces of evil from this pillow.
Vanquish them. Destroy them!
Now!
Ah.
The devil!
We cast you out, every unclean spirit...
...every Satanic power...
...every onslaught of the infernal adversary.
Be gone and stay far from this creature of God...
...for it is he who commands you, it is he...
...he who would still the sea...
...the wind and the storm.
- flee, enemy of the faith, you foe of the human race.
That's enough now, do you hear me?
No one is going to die. put the unholy tempter to flight. and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
I'm supposed to take care of this place...
...but I feel so bad.
Never seem to have any time.
You ever wonder if the people you help are just mistaken?
Yeah. Sometimes, I suppose.
But you still do what you do.
Why not? I haven't seen a prayer hurt anyone yet.
So you're happy to have them continue believing something that may not be true?
Yes, why not?
And what is it you believe?
I believe that people prefer to lie to themselves than face the truth.
The truth, yeah. Certainty.
I will leave immediately.
I understand. Thank you.
Rosaria just tried to drown herself.
We gave her pethidine and trazodone but she won't calm down.
Legally we can't give her anything else.
Look what I've done to her, priest!
And I'm not finished yet!
Leave it.
Let her see who is in command.
Demon. Deceiver.
Speak your name.
Never.
Why are you living in her?
Because her suffering is sweet.
What do you plan to do with her?
Eat the flies from her rotting flesh.
How did you enter her?
With her father's seed.
- So you remember being raped?
- Don't address it directly.
When the devil has nothing better to do, he rapes his children.
I don't understand.
You know how to swear in every language?
Therefore let us go down and confound their tongue...
...that they may not understand one another's speech.
You know the Bible well.
We know it very well.
Very clever.
Don't patronize me, doubter!
It is I who chose you.
- Why do you call me "doubter"?
- Because it's true.
A liar knows a liar.
Are you a liar, Rosaria?
What is it you want me to believe?
There's nothing to believe.
Then there is no devil and you're not possessed?
You fear me, mortal!
How can I fear you if you don't exist?
You think you outsmarted him?
That's not the devil.
It's just a very, very sick girl.
She doesn't need a priest, she needs a shrink.
He still has you fooled, hasn't he?
You forgot your bag of tricks.
He's a deceiver, Michael.
He's a deceiver.
Hold on. Hold on, Rosaria.
This is a tragedy. How could this happen?
Who worked here today?
I want to talk with everyone.
Tell me about the mother.
There was internal bleeding, massive hemorrhaging.
We did everything in our power...
...but unfortunately we couldn't save her or her baby.
What now?
Oh, nothing.
It's finished.
He took a life.
That's what he wants, ultimately.
He'll probably find someone else.
You should go home, get some rest.
You've had a hard night.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
I failed her.
You did what you thought was best.
Yeah.
I gotta go.
Take care of yourself.
You're a good man, Michael.
You have a good soul.
Defend it.
Guard it.
Cherish it.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.
You picked a perfect day for it.
I appreciate you doing this.
- No names.
- No names. Promise.
There's no way she touched the baby because she was restrained.
That's right.
What do you make of that?
It's confounding.
That's the story.
It's yours to interpret as you will.
You can call me if you have any questions.
Thank you.
What changed your mind?
To do this?
I just needed to tell someone.
So let me get this straight.
You ran away from home and chose a life of celibacy?
- How bad could home be? - It sounds stupid when you say it like that.
It sounds stupid because it doesn't add up.
Are you saying you never felt a calling?
My mother...
...she used to say she felt the hand of God on me.
Did you feel it?
I wanted to.
- So how did you end up in all this?
- It's a long story.
We're not going anywhere, so come on.
My parents committed my brother to a mental institution when he was 19.
He was so tormented.
He said he heard voices telling him to do things.
He used to tell me it was the devil speaking to him.
Sometimes he would tell me what the devil said.
And sometimes the things he said would come true.
It frightened me.
He frightened me.
I know it sounds terrible, but it's just easier when I don't think about him.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women...
...and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary...
...mother of God...
...pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
I'm sorry to wake you, Michael.
I thought it best to tell you myself.
It's your father.
And he hasn't regained consciousness?
No. The stroke was massive.
He could stabilize or he could stay like this.
I see.
I'm sorry. There isn't much more
I can tell you at this point.
I'm sorry, Michael.
I'll include him in my prayers.
We can help arrange your travel.
Thank you.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Airlines are warning passengers to expect more delays...
...even when the dust from the volcano in Iceland has settled.
Tonight, the ash plume has shut the airports of 22 countries on the continent...
...with Italy and Switzerland among the latest to close their airspace.
Thousands of passengers are stranded, with some being told...
...it could be a week before they get another flight.
- Once the ash clears...
- I need a room.
- ...a backlog of flights...
- No problem.
...will mean further disruption.
Valerie Rigg, Egetsa Coverage.
I'm calling to check on my father's condition.
Istvan Kovak.
K-O-V-A-K.
I'll connect you.
- Michael.
- Yeah, yeah. It's Michael.
I'm scared.
It's okay. Dad, you're okay.
No. Something happened.
- It's okay, Dad.
- Where are you?
I wish you were here.
I'll be home soon.
Something happened with my flight.
Where am I?
You're in the hospital.
What is it, Dad?
Dad?
They're hurting me.
Who?
Dad?
- Mr. Kovak?
- Yeah.
- It's Dr. Vorachian.
- Yes.
Mr. Kovak, I'm afraid
I've got some very bad news.
Your father passed away this afternoon.
Uh, what?
Your father died this afternoon.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Kovak.
Well, that's impossible. I...
I was just speaking with him, just now.
Mr. Kovak, your father was declared dead about six hours ago.
I was a witness.
I'm very sorry to have to tell you...
"Whoever lives by believing in me will never die."
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy...
...Lord have mercy.
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon her.
May she rest in peace.
Doubter!
Michael.
A liar knows a liar.
Michael, they're hurting me.
Dad?
- I'm scared.
- Hey.
Wait! Dad!
- Where are you?
- Radre.
Radre.
Don't worry.
The pain is gone.
There's nothing to believe.
I don't know what's going on.
I'm hallucinating. I'm seeing things,
I'm hearing things.
I can't explain it.
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
Michael, what happened?
Look, I need your help.
I feel like I'm going insane.
Can you come meet me?
He's feeling much better since the Father prayed for him.
Did Father send you?
The other day I saw her son whisper something to her.
I need to know what it was.
Your son whispered something to you the other day.
He's a baby.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
Please, it's very important that you tell us.
Please.
He said...
...your father was going to die.
Who told him that?
He says you know.
He says you've seen it too.
Seen what?
The demon.
The mule.
- Where are you going?
- My father died last night.
What did you say?
I said, my father died...
...last night.
Oh, God.
That's awful. I'm so sorry.
How did that kid know?
I need to talk to Lucas.
Bless my dolly, Father?
Hm?
Father?
Father.
Let's get you inside.
- I don't want to lie down.
- Okay.
Then what were you doing out there?
Huh?
I said, what were you doing out there?
I'm not sure.
I found myself walking and I...
I think...
I think I did something awful.
It was terrible.
I can't pray any longer because
I'm no longer in a state of grace...
...and prayer is our only salvation.
It's your only salvation.
And remember this:
It knows you, it knows all your sins.
Secrets.
So you'll need help.
- With what?
- You'll have to lock me up.
Go find Father Xavier.
Because it is strong...
...this thing, this terror.
The terror is real, Michael.
It's real.
But you'll only defeat it when you believe.
So go now, lock me up.
Go now. Lock me up!
I think Father Xavier has left for the day.
Please. It's very urgent.
He's going to Civitavecchia for the weekend.
What's his cell number?
Hello, this is Father Xavier.
I am currently unavailable.
Leave a message after the tone.
This is Michael Kovak. There's a serious problem with Father Lucas.
Contact me. I'm going to his house.
He belongs to me now.
Michael.
What was that?
What?
I don't know.
Lover of my soul
Let me to thy bosom fly
When the nearer...
Father?
I'm afraid he's out.
Come in, please.
Ah.
So shall we begin?
In time, Father.
I told you, he's not here.
Then who are you?
I'm just an old friend.
- "Friend"?
- Yeah.
I'm not sure I follow you.
Oh, you follow me, Michael.
You've always followed me.
Did you enjoy our gift, the one we hung on your door?
You following me now...
...Michael?
Close the door, please.
We don't want to be disturbed, do we?
Your father says to say hello, by the way.
Hell-o.
You don't know my father.
Oh, he says he enjoyed his final little chat with you.
I'm guessing you didn't enjoy it as much.
- You're a liar.
- Yes, that's what they all tell me.
Your father died at 4:20 p.m...
...in the same miserable hospital in which your mother died...
...or passed away, as they say.
And his last conscious moments...
...were full of panic and full of terror.
Alone in that house of the dead with no family to hold his hand...
...no loved ones to kiss him goodbye.
Because you deserted him, Michael...
...and this caused him great pain, you know, in the end.
You hurt him most.
And all for God.
Are you reading my mind?
Yes. No.
Maybe. No. Yes. Perhaps.
- Are you reading mine?
- What am I thinking now?
Oh, you're so tedious, you little piece of mouse shit.
Do you think I'm afraid of you?
You couldn't even stand up to your father, could you? Your daddy, your mommy.
- Mikey, Mikey, Mikey!
- Stand back!
- You don't command me.
- No, God does.
Oh, God does. Is that so? Wow, cool.
Awesome. Whatever, dude.
You and your puking truth!
You are nothing! You know nothing!
Doubter!
Cherish your doubts, Michael.
Jesus, lover of my soul.
This is lovely, isn't it?
Oh, I will never leave you. I will never.
So please, Mr. Preacher Man, please,
Mr. Priest, pray for God to help me.
Me, I'm just a poor little Welshman.
All dressed up for the carnival, Mommy.
God is not here, priest.
Oh, God, help me!
God help me!
God help me!
God help me!
Michael...
...what's happening to me?
- Oh, God help me.
- Father.
Tie me up. Tie me up.
Angelina!
Angelina!
Angelina!
Help me.
Now!
- Now what?
- I don't know.
- Maybe we should wait for Father Xavier.
- We can't keep him tied up till Monday.
If you don't wanna do this,
I'll understand.
No.
This is what I asked to see.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son...
...and of the Holy Spirit, bless this, your servant.
Keep her safe from harm, protect her from evil. Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Just repeat what I say.
Just repeat what he says, honey.
- Lord, have mercy.
- Have mercy.
- Unbeliever.
- Christ, have mercy.
- Have mercy.
- Doubter!
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.
Hell has no mercy!
I took the priest, I'll take you.
Let us pray.
"Save this man, Lucas Trevant, your servant.
I'm no servant.
- Because he hopes in you, God.
- Hope is dead!
Let the enemy have no victory over him. Lord, hear us.
Lord, hear us.
He can't hear you, he's not here.
God is dead!
Drive out, O Lord, the power of the devil.
Hey, Angie, has he done it to you yet?
That's what he wants.
That's what you want too, right? be protected and safeguarded in body and soul.
Hey, Mikey, I think she likes you.
Nice titties, yeah?
I invoke your holy name and humbly request...
...that you snatch from this demon...
- Pokey hokey, pocus holy...
...this man who was created in...
- Created in sin.
- Who was created in your likeness.
- In your likeness of sin and filth.
In the name of your Lord,
Jesus Christ, your son.
- Climb up on my knees, sonny boy.
- Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
By the mysteries of the incarnation...
...the suffering, the death and resurrection and ascension of our Lord, Jesus Christ...
...I command you.
By some sign, give me your name."
Your name, demon.
Your name, demon.
Tell me your name!
My love.
My flower.
My beautiful.
Hey, Daddy's calling from hell.
Michael.
Michael.
What happened?
I can't do it.
It's more than just saying the words.
You've seen him.
What's not to believe in?
Me.
Don't you understand?
Then why are you here?
Something brought you here, Michael.
All the decisions you made.
You left your home, your father.
You came here.
It all led to this.
It's fate.
You're not alone.
What did you just say?
You're not alone.
Michael.
Father.
Give up.
You don't have the strength.
You don't have the faith.
Just pray, Michael.
Well, hello, Angie. and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
May I ask you a question?
When was the last time you saw your brother? thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
You little slut.
Don't listen.
Oh, don't listen. But isn't that what you did, Angie?
Not listen to him? Your little brother.
Leaving him to rot away in that stinking booby hatch, turning your back on him...
...when he was being strangled by his own screams.
Do you remember that, Angie?
Do you remember?
You will never forget.
So we do what we do with him now.
He's living in the land of misery and dread, thanks to big sister.
Oh, why the tears, sweetie pie?
I thought you wanted the truth.
Like laughing boy here.
He just lives for the truth.
Isn't that so, Mikey?
Just leave her alone.
You think I don't know all your festering secrets? Your nickel-and-dime sins?
You were ashamed of your father, he was ashamed of you.
You hated him, he hated you back.
It was a charming family.
How could God possibly love you when your daddy didn't? Hm?
No. You were never meant for God, Michael.
You were always meant for me, honey.
Enough!
Oopsie-daisy.
Close to home.
And that was no squeaky angel your mother saw all those years ago.
No.
'Twas I.
You chose me long, long ago...
...when you were just an itsy-bitsy little boy pooping in his pants.
Remember, Michael.
You remember, Michael?
Remember when you bent that cross?
If only you remember.
Remember, Michael. Remember.
Remember.
Oh, dear.
Our poor little savior all alone on his cross.
Yeah.
God chose you, Michael.
That's why you're here.
Just accept it.
- Yeah.
- Accept God.
- Accept the devil.
- You can't win without him.
No.
All alone.
No!
Shall I pour the sick and rotting truth of the dying world...
...into your precious, golden womb?
You remember his strangling screams...
...when you turned your back on him and walked away?
You wanted the truth, little lady.
Well, here I am.
So how about you, kissy lips?
Do you feel that probing around inside you, Michael?
Lucas, listen to me, please.
Lucas is not here.
He's never coming back.
You feel that digging and scraping around inside you like God's dirty fingernail?
Do you believe in me now, Michael?
Do you believe in me now?
Yes.
Yes. I believe in you.
I believe in the devil.
I believe in you...
...so I believe in God.
I accept him in this moment.
I accept God.
I believe in God the Father, the maker of heaven and earth...
...of all that is seen and unseen.
I believe.
I exorcise you, most unclean spirit.
Warp of vices, creator of agony.
In the name of Jesus Christ, leave this man.
In the name of the Virgin Mary, leave now.
I command you.
I, who believe.
In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ...
...be uprooted and expelled from this creature of God.
He who commands you is he who ordered you to be thrown down...
...from the highest heaven into the depths of hell.
Hear therefore and fear,
Satan, enemy of faith.
Fear him who was crucified as man and who rose from death!
I will never leave you, Michael.
I will never leave you.
Speak your name.
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you, speak your name.
In the name of the Holy Spirit,
I command you. Give me your name!
It is God who commands you!
Your name!
Your name!
Give me your name!
Ba'al!
Ba'al!
Ba'al!
Ba'al!
I know you, Ba'al.
And I command you, retire therefore.
Depart from this place. Leave!
Surrender now.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...
...forever and ever.
It's good as new, huh?
Yeah.
Well, she wasn't a bad little bike.
You know, back in her golden days...
...she brought me out here all those years ago.
Anyway...
So you're off. You're leaving.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, I hope you find your place in the world one of these fine days.
- I hope so.
- Now, when you do...
...don't forget to say a few prayers for an old sinner.
Throw a couple of Hail Marys this way if that's not too much trouble.
That a deal?
- It's a deal.
- Good.
You know, the first day you showed up...
...I thought you were so full of it, I was tempted to kick you into the street.
But I didn't because I saw quite a bit of myself in you.
Scary, isn't it?
- Yeah, it sure is.
- Yeah.
All right, that's it. Thanks for everything.
Safe journey. And one other thing.
Faith becomes you. Stay with it.
Keep fighting the good fight with all thy might.
Cool.
Get out of here.
Goodbye, Father.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It has been six weeks since my last confession.
And what are your sins?
Father Michael Kovak is one of 14 exorcists practicing in the United States today.
He now works out of his parish near Chicago.
Father Lucas Trevant has performed over two thousand exorcisms.
He continues to practice in a township outside of Florence.
It is all gone!
Well, how can it possibly be fucking gone?
There was 40 grand in there.
Yeah, eight months ago there was 40 grand in there.
Eight months! How many fucking scatter cushions do you need?
Don't talk to me like I'm a cunt!
Baby? Are you all right?
It doesn't make sense.
I know!
You haven't worked a single day for eight months.
Take the money for the Jacuzzi out of the holiday dough.
I can't have it out of action cos it's for my back.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Wake up, Jay!
There's no fucking holiday money!
And there is nothing wrong with your back!
It's all in your fucking head.
Fuck. Fucking...
Jay!
Ouch!
Jay!
Jay!
Oh!
Jay!
- 24 tins of tuna?
- Yeah, they were doing a deal.
Can you stop spinning?
You're doing my head in.
- You should've done me a list then.
- I did! It was on the fridge, you left it!
- 10 bottles of wine?
- You invited 'em.
What do you want to drink, Shel? Herbal tea?
Oh, look, it says toilet roll and it's underlined twice.
Oh, 197 pounds. And, no, you didn't get any toilet roll, did you, just, you know, loads of bottles of wine.
- That's good, Jay.
- I'll pop round the newsagents.
They'll have it, won't they?
You're in serious danger of turning into a miserable cow, Shel.
I'm not going to sit here and have you glaring at me for another half hour.
Sam? Sammy?
Babe, he's got loads of stuff.
- He doesn't need any more.
- It was four and a half quid, you wally.
He's got loads.
- En guard!
- Cool.
Daddy's promised to do bedtime stories tonight.
Yeah, we can do that, mate.
Get him! Come on, Sam!
'There were once these two brave and honourable soldiers,
'and they were in charge of guarding a man in a car.'
I want a story about king Arthur.
My story is better. No, it isn't.
Are you listening, cos you can go straight to sleep without one?
What kind of car?
A bullet-proof one.
They were driving around this city, you see.
What city?
Bagdadistan.
So there were these insurgents and they made a bomb and it blew up the Humvee in front of the column.
It's not real though, is it?
No, not any more, no.
You shouldn't shout at Mummy.
Well, she started it, mate.
You are a bit lazy though.
- Who says?
- Mummy.
Does she now?
And me.
Do it, Daddy.
OK.
One, two, three...
Abracadabra.
Hi, how're you doing?
You're looking gorgeous as usual...
Ahh... please God
It's so good to see you. Hi.
- Fiona.
- Come on in.
- You?
- Yeah.
Canny wee tipple... your favourite?
Is that you?
Mmm! Swedish National service.
I didn't know they made girls do that!
Oh, they don't!
They don't, I wanted to do it.
Why should the boys get to have all the fun, eh?
Here you both are...
- What uniform is that?
- Security assignment.
Is it dangerous?
In danger of getting your knickers ripped off later, big girl.
The money's good.
The money's really good, Jay.
I can't.
Here.
Try one of these.
Blow your fucking head off.
I'm not eating anything red at the moment.
- Does Shel know?
- What, about the diet?
No, about the job.
Might have mentioned something in passing.
No wonder she's been on my fucking back.
Don't do that, Gal.
I wish someone would fucking clarify the chain of command here.
- Who's wagging the dog?
- Jay! Jay!
Coming.
That's cleared that up.
Fuck off.
We are done. Bon Appetit. Tuck in, everyone.
Well done. Thank you.
Aww!
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you. It's not my worst.
- Army and Navy.
- Gravy?
Your track record's good.
Dig in.
And now... Cheers and welcome.
Yeah, cheers. Here's to you.
- Lots of love.
- Cheers.
Thank you, thank you...
Is there anything here that you want, Fiona?
I'm really happy. You sure?
What are these little chef's hats about?
I just thought... you could pick them up with your fingers.
They're little Swedish chefs.
Who is gonna say Grace, are you going to say Grace?
Oh, Stop.
- Not at my table.
- No?
No, no.
I could do it in Irish for you.
So what-what sort of...
Do you just sell anything? I don't...
No, it's kind of...
No, it's mainly... sort of IT stuff and, you know.
It's commercial sales.
It's not like knocking on doors and, you know.
- With a suitcase.
- Yeah, it's not flannels and tea towels.
I know you would assume that from Gal's accent, but...
It was all right, kinda, when I was younger and stuff and when we first come out of the army.
But it's not, you know...
As Sam is getting older and stuff.
It's sort of difficult for him.
He wants his dad, you know.
So, you have to deal with that while I am away, don't you?
I think it's hard on us.
Three months starts pushing it we used to say.
- Three months?
- Sometimes, yeah.
- Wow.
- Bit like being a single mum.
- Can I just nip to the loo please?
- Mmm, course.
- It's just round the corner.
- OK, thanks.
The lock's not great, but we know you are in there, so I don't think Sam will get the shock of his life.
- Top up?
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll get it. I'll get it sit down, sit down.
- Sure?
- Old world, new world?
- Whatever you fancy, darling.
Whatever, mate.
Christ. You need a circular saw to get through this meat.
Because you took the entire rack.
- I thought...
- I'd cut them all up, hadn't I?
I thought there was three big ones.
You could've said to me, darling.
Do you know what, unlike you,
I didn't want to embarrass you in front of everyone.
As for this, what's all this game?
We've got every dinner set and bit of cutlery known to man.
You've served the gravy in a fucking Pyrex.
What's that about?
It's like a chemistry set. ls that all right?
Yeah, that's my favourite.
So, what do you do, Fiona?
Hman resources
Hatchet man.
Sorry. Hatchet person.
What is it? I mean what does that entail?
If there is a department that is under-performing then...
I go in and assess the extraneous manpower and de-force accordingly...
I'm waiting for a comment!
I know there is one coming.
You sort of sack people?
It's not personal.
It is probably personal to them...
...and their families.
When was the last time you cared about the welfare of a family?
Oh, yeah I know, eight months ago.
There's a bigger picture in the business world.
Your picture doesn't stretch any further than your front door, does it mate?
You mean the Jacuzzi.
I think the 80's recession was a lot more glamorous.
No this is, this is much worse.
There's a lot of dirty work to be done.
I'll tell you one lot who had no time for extraneous.
The Nazis.
Here we go.
I just wish I could have had a go at them.
Difficult for a man to know where he stands these days.
You should've had a crack at the Mick, mate.
A tour of duty in Belfast would've done you the world of good.
I've never understood the whole Irish thing.
Cos, I mean, it's all the same religion, so...
Not really, love.
They're all Christian.
- That's true.
- That's debatable.
What do I get? Fucking Iraq!
- Iraq's over. What about now, eh?
- Yeah?
I've finished.
Abracadabra!
That's my fucking pal, in front of my fucking pal.
That's not just your fucking pal.
It's not just your fucking pal.
It's not just your fucking house, Jay!
Come on, mate, let's get you to bed.
Don't you pay any attention to them, they're just over excited. why?
Because they've been drinking, all right?
Don't you ever drink, do you hear me?
- Promise?
- Not even water?
Especially not that shit.
Do you know the government puts stuff in it that shrinks your balls!
But you fall out with people, don't you?
You fall out with your mates, but then you become friends again, don't you?
That's just what mummys and daddys do sometimes.
That's why they're mummys and daddys because they're best friends, you know?
Sometimes they fight, sometimes the argue.
You know...
But it doesn't mean anything.
So, don't be worrying, all right?
Good lad.
Sorry.
No. Don't be silly.
How old's your boy?
- Sammy is seven.
- Oh.
You?
No. I never wanted any.
You'll change your mind.
No, I don't think so.
I love kids though...
He was the one, you know?
The love of your life?
No. The one who started it.
Knock. Knock.
Where?
Local, UK.
How many on the list?
Three. Not too strenuous.
How much?
Don't ask. Shel got it.
It's nice.
What do you think of Fiona?
Is she the one you met at your sister's?
No, Boxercise
What?
Hey man, I tell you, a lot of tit women.
It relieves your sexual tension as well.
Fuck's sake.
Hey, don't knock it till you've tried, you.
She likes it rough then?
- Wouldn't you like to fucking know?
- I'm too old for that shit, so are you.
Yeah? Speak for yourself, granddad.
- Kiev was...
- Yeah, yeah... I know.
Listen man, that was eight months ago.
You've got to get back on the horse again.
Do you know what I mean?
It's all right, it's all right.
The old team back together again.
The two musketeers!
We gonna do it?
Fucking get rid of that.
Come on sweetheart. Come on.
Are you OK? All right?
'You could put almost anything in front of it.'
It doesn't matter how disgusting it is as long as you put that after it, you're safe...
Fritzl could have got away with it.
It's OK, cos I don't have my gloves on.
Who'd have thunk it?
# I was very sad last night
# You came by, I was so glad
# Though sadness covered the smile I kept for you
# I was waiting for the cloud to pass over
# Then I could show my love...
I'm really sorry.
# You could have made me laugh if you'd stayed
# But you left
# I was more confused than
I was before you came
# I was frightened I
Cheers! I'll call you, all right?
- You're not driving, mate.
- I am once I find my fucking keys.
Shel, call a cab.
I'm all right man, dry your eyes for fuck's sake.
- I'll drop the car for you in the morning.
- The fuck you will.
Why do you have such a problem following orders?
Get your fucking hands off.
Listen, don't go behind my back to her again!
Get the fuck off me, man!
You ripped my fucking jeans, you cunt!
That's that shirt fucked.
Wha-hey, come on!
Thank fuck that's over.
Babe?
Baby, come on back in, it's getting cold.
Yeah, I'll be up in a minute.
'Wake up.
'Wake up.
'Wake up.'
Wake up.
Wake up.
- Wake up.
- No.
Not now!
Come here, I ain't gonna tickle you.
I got you now. There is no escaping!
I'm sorry about last night.
I was being an idiot.
Shel!
Shel!
Yep. No, that's no problem.
They'll be there.
- Shel!
- What?
- Come out here!
- What is it?
Come out here and I'll show you.
No, you come in here.
Shel. Come out here, you lazy bugger.
That's the last time.
It's an offering, not an insult.
No. She's taking the piss.
It's a cat, it can't take the piss.
What is it?
Oh no, Jay!
It's a rabbit.
Put it in the outside bin.
Fuck am I. I'll cook it up with some onion and garlic.
Not in my kitchen!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, just get rid of it, babe.
Smell of that.
What's Daddy doing?
Daddy's showing off.
What's he eating?
He's eating a rabbit.
Where from?
From the cat.
Daddy thinks the cat brings us little presents.
The cat thinks we don't eat enough in this house.
I just think the cat likes killing rabbits.
- Hey!
- Who goes there?
You all right?
- It was a good one last night, weren't it?
- Eh?
A good one last night.
- You reckon?
- Yeah.
- Nice food and all that.
- It had its moments.
Where's Fiona? Off de-forcing?
Fuck knows.
What?
I think I was a bit of a bad boy last night.
I woke up this morning with a
'Dear John' taped to my cock.
You're joking.
No.
Oh, mate.
Get your shit together, the client's expecting us.
I like this car.
Looks nice but it's a dog on corners.
Here - better safe than sorry.
It's a bit over the top for a meeting, innit?
Do you know who's in there?
Cos I fucking don't.
You come with recommendations.
They're well earned.
Good.
Necessary.
Ah, fuck!
It's all right.
No, it's not.
I hear Kiev was stormy.
I'm in the process of rewriting it.
Good.
It's important to learn from one's mistakes, I always find.
Fuck, that was dramatic.
I'm bleeding on the carpet.
None of them ever say please or thank you - that's what really fucks me off.
I mean, good manners cost nothing, sure it doesn't.
How did he know about Kiev?
He was just letting you know that he knows.
- What does that mean?
- Psychology, isn't it.
Fucking hell. Is that your wanking hand?
- No.
- Hmm. Well, you know...
...every cloud...
- One of each?
- Take 'em yeah.
They say that's quite good.
I need to stop and get a bandage or something.
Got to get through reception without them noticing.
It's fucking swollen.
I'll walk on that side.
You stay on the left and
I'll walk on the right.
OK.
I could do with clearing up the sink a little bit.
- Leave that to me, I'll do it.
- OK.
Did you take one of those this morning, babe?
Yeah, that's all right, it's like six a day or something.
Handsome.
You going to be all right?
See you soon.
Back in the house - you'll get wet feet.
Go.
Bye.
I love this bit.
We're not going to the fucking seaside, Gal.
Thank you.
Can you put your PIN in there, please?
Here on business?
- Crackers.
- Excuse me?
Novelty key rings. Paper hats.
Plastic fingernails. Doggy charms.
- They're my speciality.
- Sorry?
You wouldn't be, love, honestly.
You don't look like sales.
- Have the rooms got free Wi-Fi?
- No.
I'm afraid that card's been declined.
Let me just try that one more time.
Yeah, do.
I'll just ring for authorisation.
It's OK I'll get it.
Don't worry about it - I'll get it.
Hello, Shel?
Yeah, they just declined my card at the hotel.
Yeah, they declined it.
No, there's no money in it.
One I look like a right mug, and two it draws attention to me and Gal.
Straight away - who are these people who can't afford to pay for the room.
- My name is Richard.
- Nice to meet you.
Friends call me Dick.
I can't believe you haven't had ten minutes to do it.
You could have done it on your phone.
The soap's nice.
- Is it still in the wrapper?
- Yeah.
Nice. I fucking hate dirty soap.
So, what do you reckon?
Do the usual, follow this guy around; see what he gets up, who he hangs out with?
What, do it properly, you mean?
Not just mow him down in a hail of bullets like some Hackney crack head.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's 45 and lives in 14 Coldwater Road.
If he's got a dog, do we shoot the dog too?
Yeah, well...
Dogs are ten a penny, aren't they?
I just wanted to say 'thank you' to Justin.
His teachings have helped me put everything in perspective.
I haven't had an anxiety attack in three weeks.
Don't listen to them.
It's like a fucking worm boring through my skull.
It's like a graveyard and they still fucking plod up next to us.
...you could intersect with the group when I saw you having trouble rationalizing your emotional response to Duncan's departure.
I can't wait to see him rationalise your emotional response.
Don't.
- I'm gonna kill 'em, Gal.
- Don't kill 'em, mate.
I am, I'm gonna massacre that table of people now.
In a hotel.
I ain't gonna shoot 'em, Gal.
I'm going to do 'em one at a time and do 'em slow.
- With a butter knife?
- Yeah.
We should have a song.
We should have a song.
- A song... OK, shall I get the old guitar?
- Yeah, go on then.
Oh fuck, here we go.
You're expecting Jeremy Beadle, aren't you?
- But he's dead, he can't help you!
- He's not going to play that guitar, is he?
# Onward, Christian soldiers
# Marching as to war
I With the cross of Jesus
# Going on before...
I even know this one.
I At the sign of triumph...
Look at 'em, fucking happy bastards.
# On then, Christian soldiers, on to... I
You're giving me indigestion.
Oh, sorry.
Apology accepted.
Sometimes God's love can be hard to swallow.
Not as hard as a dinner plate.
God loves you.
Does he? Well, tell God from me...
If you're the kind of people he hangs about with, stay out of my way.
No more guitar mate, not in restaurants.
There is a time and a place.
And your time and place is in a very isolated location where no one is likely to be for about a fucking hundred years.
OK?
Cos Jimmy Hendrix you ain't.
Very sorry about my friend, please accept my most humble apologies.
And if you are speaking to the big man, put a word in for us, will you?
Get them all a drink, love.
Double orange juices all round.
It don't look like the house of a major villain, does it?
Oh, for fuck's sake, a fucking priest! Brilliant!
You'll enjoy this one, Gal.
Yeah well, at least it's not a toddler.
What's he got there?
Oh, a new brief case.
You're worried.
Maybe.
He's probably shagging kids.
Might get you a pass on all the other terrible shit you've done.
It's complicated.
As a parent I'd do them all, even if I weren't getting paid.
Just for the record,
I've hardly done any terrible shit.
Turn round.
Thank you.
Why do you think he had that smile on his face?
Probably at peace, you know.
Don't know how much at peace I'd feel if I was getting a bullet in the back of my head.
'Can you see me, yeah?'
'Yeah, sorry I just woke up.'
- 'Sorry.'
- 'No, it's fine!
'It's just... Sam was up in the night!
- 'Is he all right?'
- 'Oh yeah, he's fine.
'Bad dreams about the cat.
'How's your room?
I couldn't tell when I booked.'
Yeah, it's all right.
- 'On schedule?
- One down.
- 'Clean?'
- Yeah, course.
Don't worry, I'm all right.
'Babe, Fiona came round.
'With a present for Sam.'
That's a bit weird.
'I didn't like her at first, but I don't mind her now.
'What do you think?'
- You could do with the company.
- 'Yeah, that's what I thought.'
- Don't let her anywhere near the garage.
- 'I'm not an idiot.
'I've got to go - Sam's calling, all right?'
- Do you miss me?
- 'Of course I do. always.
'Love you.'
Looks like nothing this bloke.
They all look like nothing, Gal.
He does look like my uncle Terry though.
Uncle Terry, that's a new one.
He wasn't a special uncle, he actually was my uncle.
- Right.
- Yeah, he was a cunt.
He wasn't one of the people your old man took money off of to be your special uncle?
Oh, come on now. it's a family do.
Have you spoken to Fiona?
No.
She's been round at the house, talking to Shel.
- Really? That's interesting.
- Yeah...
Says she's waiting.
What, for me?
Well yeah, I'd imagine so.
I'll leave her dangling a bit longer.
Do you know what I mean, keep 'em keen, eh?
Gal, give her a ring. I don't want some...
...glary eyed phantom kipping in my front room when I get home.
Don't you dare talk about my Fiona like that.
She's a good looking girl.
She's a bit of a fucking demon in bed as well, I tell you.
- Yeah?
- Oh!
Fucking hell!
- Details?
- You know...
Put it this way,
I had to shave my pubes afterwards.
Gal?
What, are we off?
Right, we'll go and see what is in that lock-up first.
Really?
I thought we were just going to observe?
No, we are going to go and have a look, mate.
Lovely... it's a wank den.
You don't get shot for having a wank den.
Porn business?
There's not enough of it.
No, you're right.
Fuck.
- Uh.
- What?
You don't want to fucking look at that boy, I'll tell you.
Well, I've got to now, haven't I?
Fucking hell, mate.
Help. Help!
There's been a mistake.
Oh, yeah?
Mistaken identity.
Just remembered we're your burglars?
Really?
If you are, take what you want.
I could do with some reassurance that the world's not full of murdering perverts.
We saw the lock-up.
- Christ.
- Yeah.
It's game on, big lad.
Yeah, don't bother. Fucking freak!
Listen mate...
I've seen your wee film.
I'm just the librarian.
Who for?
This is not fair.
I'll show you 'not fair'.
Please.
Don't - because it makes me hate you more, yeah?
Who films it?
I can't tell you that.
He lives at Greenwold Street.
15 Greenwold Street.
Where do you keep your money?
- In the safe.
- Which room?
Top of the stairs on the right.
Does he know?
What?
Who you are.
He doesn't, does he?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Before he comes back...
...I just want to say...
...thank you.
For what?
I'm glad to have met you.
Nice.
I understand.
You have to do what you have to do.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You crazy fucking bastard.
Oh, fuck!
You can clean this fucking mess up yourself, you know that?
Fine.
I'm getting a fucking bag.
Let's nip round to that house on Greenwold Street.
Fuck that, you need a long lie down, big lad.
I'm going to Greenwold Street right fucking now.
- What the fuck is Shel gonna say?
- Then don't fucking tell her then.
Fuck!
You're well off list here, man.
Right! Don't hang about.
If I'm not back in twenty minutes, come and get me.
Don't you worry, I will.
Fucking first job in months and he's gone off again, for fuck's sake.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Jesus Christ.
Was that twenty minutes?
Let's get the fuck out of here.
What the fuck are we going to do with him now?
Brilliant. Fucking brilliant.
You're covered in blood.
I'll burn 'em.
They say the sign of a good painter and decorator?
- What?
- Clean overalls. No bodging.
Point taken.
It doesn't feel wrong.
They were bad people.
They should suffer.
I used to love looking at tires when I was a kid.
Hi babe, I wasn't expecting you back...
- We haven't got any food.
- That's all right we'll go out.
Erm, it's a school night.
I just want to see Sammy, yeah?
No, he's on a play date, babe.
Can we talk about this later?
Hi Jay, you back?
We've just had a glass of wine.
Yeah, and a moan.
- Do you want to join us?
- Er...
Yeah... I should get me... all my bits and bobs.
- I should go.
- Oh no, don't be silly. You were here first.
No, stay. It's all right isn't it?
Yeah.
Shel!
Jesus, Jay! oh, God!
It's infected, babe.
You've got to go see a doctor.
I'm not going.
No...
I'll get some cream or something.
'Would you say you were suffering from stress?'
'Yes.'
'Do you experience fatigue? Nausea?'
Erm...Yes.
No.
Why do you think that is?
Any particular reason?
No.
Professionally...
Some financial stuff.
I've got a family.
Now what about your sex life, how's that?
Normal?
Listen, my wife said I had to come, so you could look at my hand and...
You're fine!
Yeah, but my hand isn't.
Do you want to have a look at it?
Better still, I can give you some advice.
What happened to Dr Bapkin?
The past is gone.
The future is not yet here.
There is only ever this moment.
'Jay!
'Jay!
Jay!l
Bloody...
Kids maybe?
Maybe gypsies.
You all right, sweetheart?
Someone's murdered the cat.
Fucking loved that cat.
Didn't know.
No, neither did I till it happened.
- Look...
- What?
- It's a message, isn't it?
- Yeah, received loud and clear.
We lifted enough money the other night, we could sack half this job off, man.
What?
There's pictures of us outside the priest's house, Jay.
They've got a file on fucking Kiev.
- Where the fuck did they get that from?
- So fucking what?
Listen man, let's just knock it on the head.
It's not doing your head any good and it's fucking not doing mine any good either.
Yeah, I think you are right, we should just give up.
We should let things like this happen and not do fuck all about it.
We're doing a fucking job, man.
It's not a crusade, all right?
Right! Then you don't bother, but when I start something, I fucking finish it, Gal.
Yeah I know, I know.
I've been standing around watching how you fucking finish it.
- You're arsehole's gone, mate.
- Listen man.
I can't fucking work with you any more if you're going to go fucking over the top every time you get a fucking lump hammer in your hand.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gal.
I'm really sorry, mate. I'm so sorry.
I'm really sorry.
- More?
- Listen, man!
You're going in there like a fucking psycho on crack, what the fuck's going on?
- Wait until you see me after this shit.
- Brilliant!
I'm going to go and bury my fucking cat and you fuck off out of my gaff.
- There, that's me done.
- What?
- Listen, I can't do this any more.
- No, no, Gal please? Please.
He needs to get help.
- I know.
- All right, listen. Don't cry.
- Don't cry.
- Thank you.
Don't cry, please don't cry.
I'll call you.
We'll chat your mum up.
Get a puppy.
- OK.
- Yeah?
Has she gone to heaven?
I dunno, mate. Maybe.
Cat heaven.
You wanna talk to your uncle Gal really about that side of things.
Come here.
Where have you been?
We went for a walk to look for foxes, didn't we, mate?
- Dad said I could have a puppy.
- Did he?
Yeah, we're going to call it Arthur.
What if it's a girl?
Gwinny.
Hey you, young man, why don't you go upstairs, get out of those dirties,
- and we'll have a bath in a minute, yeah?
- OK.
I don't want to talk about it.
Really? He's ready to walk.
Good! He's gone soft.
Wake up. You wake up, fucking wake up!
Do you think if you get replacements they'll let you go free of the contract?
Is that what you want?
It doesn't look good, but if we're compromised here...
We can get you top draw replacements.
They even look like us.
- It is your job.
- What if we say...
...fuck you very much and good night?
Then you die. And your families, they die.
No wriggle room on that then?
No.
How long have we been working for you?
- Please, don't embarrass yourself.
- I'm asking you a straight question.
I see you, what you are.
What are we?
- You're cogs.
- What?
What the fuck is this?
Reconstruction.
So, keep turning.
What do you mean by fucking reconstruction?
Fuck off man... Get your hands off me.
- What's this?
- I'm leaving.
What?
I'm taking Sam to the cottage, just until the job's over.
You know you're in serious danger of losing this.
Is that what you want?
No.
- Be good for mummy yeah?
- Yes.
OK, watch your head, watch your head.
Turns out he's an MP.
Is that more acceptable than a priest?
I can't say I'm not relieved.
Well, his name's on the list.
- That's all that matters.
- OK.
You sure?
You don't want to go and have a little cry about it to Shel?
I might do if I could find her.
She's gone on holiday.
That's funny, she never mentioned anything to me.
That's funny. I don't really understand why you're calling my fucking wife, mate,
I'll be honest with you.
- Right, you're her husband, aren't you?
- Yeah, leave this now, Gal.
No.
You shouldn't fucking treat your wife like a doormat.
- All right. Thanks.
- Know what I mean?
She's a lovely wee woman, and you treat her like a fucking mug.
All your relationships have been so very successful, Gal, so thanks very much for your advice, you cunt.
Oi! What the fuck was that? Fucking...
Not in the face, fuck!
Not in the fucking face.
I'm telling Shel you started it.
She thinks I'm a saint.
She doesn't know you.
I'll go get a new one.
She won't even notice.
She notices everything.
I can't get that Fiona out of my head, you know.
- Really?
- Yeah, I think it might be love.
- You don't really know her, Gal.
- Yeah well, you know.
These things happen like that some times.
She gaffer-taped your cock.
I'm putting that down as an erotic cry for help.
I can't remember what
I was like before Shel.
Probably a lonely fucker, like me.
They say there's someone for everyone, mate.
Yeah, it's not much to ask, is it?
Right, let's go and kill this MP then.
Yeah.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
- Did you hear that?
- What?
- Chopper?
- Don't know.
The air's good.
Yeah, we should do this more often.
What, kill rich people?
No, get out in the fresh air.
Dinner's on me.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Yeah, lovely.
We'll go down and have a look at his gaff tomorrow.
What's the plan?
I can't be bothered with anything flash.
So we're not just gonna drag him down to the village square and chop his head off with a fucking axe?
Eh?
Leave it till two or three, then.
Let's go down and get an idea of the layout of the house.
You look right at home.
The two musketeers, eh?
# Oh Mr Bunny, it's gonna get cold
# I'm taking your coat off your back
# Hey Mr Bunny, what do you think?
I What do you think about that? I
That's not right.
What?
One man living in all that.
None of it's right, Gal.
That's why we're here.
Come on, let's bed down.
He's probably fucking the scullery maid anyway.
Gal.
Gal.
You awake?
Well, I wasn't, but I am now.
What?
L.m
...really sorry about that stuff.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know where it comes from.
Listen, you're a fucking madman, but you're my best mate and I love you, so...
Let's just leave it at that, eh?
Cheers.
Gal?
- Gal?
- What?
What the fuck? What?
Get your shit together - lively.
- There's too many of them, man. Don't!
- Fuck this.
Jay!
Fuck it, come on.
Are you sure you know where we are?
Yeah, yeah, I am.
- VVhat's wrong?
- Shush.
Come on.
Fuck! It's been bricked up.
- It wasn't supposed to be here...
- I thought you'd fucking scouted!
It wasn't supposed to be here, man.
They are coming from the other way, Gal.
Jay!
Jesus Christ.
Jay?
Jay?
Gal?
Gal?
C'mon mate.
Jesus, let's get you out of here mate.
I can't move mate, they've slashed...
They've slashed my fucking legs.
We've got to go.
Come on, please get up.
I'm done, mate.
Fuck.
Gal, we've got to, mate.
Tell Shel I'm sorry, will you?
Just do it, do it.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
It's all over.
Can we go home now?
Is he sick? Tired, very tired.
Shall we take you back to bed?
Get down.
Make sure Sam is all right and turn the lights off upstairs.
- Let's leave, babe.
- No, we can't go anywhere.
They've slashed the fucking tyres.
What the fuck is that?
It's too noisy!
Just fireworks.
I don't think there are many of them...
Listen, I'm going out there to find them, yeah? Take that.
I love you, yeah.
- We're on the wrong fucking beach.
- Ah...
Tide turning.
- Yeah.
We were moving faster through the channel.
- It plonked us around the fucking corner.
- No chance getting back round the coast fighting that rip.
I was hoping for a cup of tea and a cake.
- Better get off this beach.
- Mines?
- Bound to be.
: Ben...
Got a date tomorrow.
: Let me guess.
You met her down the pub.
Nurse, huge tits.
- Like a pair of ripe melons ready for the plucking.
She's got this friend...
I was...
You've got to move on sometime, Ben.
Look, just come along, have a bit of fun.
Her friend's a real doll.
She's tall, ugh, blonde.
Legs all the way up to her armpits.
Ben...
- We haven't got time for this.
I'm walking it.
- Oh, shit.
I was just admiring the view.
My little nurse is not gonna be too happy if I leave my crown jewels blown all over this beach.
You better back off, Ben.
- I trust you.
If you marry her and have kids... you better bloody well name one after me.
- Slow... and steady this time.
Better get on with it.
Don't wanna keep the nursey waiting now, do we?
- Right address this time?
- Path up there.
- Oh...
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know, I don't care.
Let's just get the job done and get the fuck off this island.
Ugly-looking place.
This is bullshit.
Where is everyone?
- They're fucking torturing some poor bastard in there.
- This isn't a rescue mission.
- What if it's one of ours?
You know what those bastards did to Blondie's men in Bordeaux.
- It's not our mission.
: Jesus.
Jesus Christ in heaven!
Help... Help us, please!
- There's bad shit going on here.
Bad shit.
Bastards. Fuckin' Nazi bastards.
- No.
It's not our war. This is our fight.
The gun, that's our mission.
- Fuck the mission.
- Jesus Christ.
We leave. Now.
We get out alive.
We get back home.
- Back home to what?
- Look, we've done what we came here to do.
We'll get fucking medals for this.
The girls will be falling all over us!
- Give me ten minutes, Joe.
- Five.
Fuck.
Fuck it.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Request radio check. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
- Fuck you.
- Joe...
- Name...
Rank...
Number. Yes?
Good teeth.
Clean.
Some people I know in Germany actually collect teeth.
Perhaps I should cut that useless tongue out.
But what use are you, if you can't... talk to me, yes?
You can thank your own people for this little trick.
Was it not your own gangster commandos who raided these very islands, killing innocent German prisoners with their hands tied behind their backs?
Cathartic, is it not?
The release of pain surging through your body.
What was your mission?
- Hmm...
- Not enough to destroy the installation, but adequate... to put it out of action for a while.
Why?
To protect your armies... as they cross the English Channel and... retake these islands?
You're a little late, aren't you?
The population here is so hungry... they're reduced to eating rats.
What is this English... Channel... anyway?
Does anybody outside of England call it that?
Do the people of these... Channel Islands even think themselves English?
So, you planned to put the gun out of action.
And presumably others of the neighbouring islands, which... as the Führer predicted are to become the staging post for your invasion of... France.
Your silence is admirable.
- Fuck you, Fritz.
: God in heaven...
It is hungry.
: You bitch!
You think I have nothing better to do than feed you?
Whore!
So, should we begin again in a more civilized way?
Or do you wish to end up like your unfortunate friend over there?
Grogan.
Captain.
Who is that woman up there?
- If only you knew the truth of that.
- Oh, I can see the truth, splattered all around this room.
What is she, a plaything for you and your men?
You take a special little fancy to her, yeah?
Want her all for yourself?
Even your own army will hang you for this.
- This?
You think a single man is responsible for this?!
She did this to them!
- You're insane.
- You may not believe this, but you and I are in the same boat.
- Call me picky, but I'm the one who's tied up and threatened with summary execution here... Fritz.
- Meyer. Klaus Meyer.
Perhaps I should rephrase.
We are in the same shit.
I admire your marvellous accent.
South Africa?
Australia? Ah!
The guttural... nuance.
New Zealand.
You are indeed a long way from home.
- Same could be said about you.
New Zealanders.
A bunch of farmers pretending to be soldiers, driving around the deserts of North Africa, attacking by night, then fleeing to hide like cowards.
So, where in England will the invasion come from?
Southampton?
Poole?
Which of these islands do you plan to take first?
Guernsey, perhaps?
Alderney?
Then to France?
Which beaches?
Oh, perhaps it's not so... bad if we were to lose these islands... to men like you.
- Never yours to lose.
- And yet here you are, thousands of miles from home.
And what... exactly is your home,
Captain Grogan?
An... island that does not belong to you either, populated by the descendents of cannibals and headhunters.
Who exactly do you fight for,
Captain Grogan?
For King and country?
Or for Britain or New Zealand?
We are more similar that you care to admit.
You are a New Zealander, but of British descent, are you not?
Was not Britain itself a nation of Vikings and Saxons, superior Germanic people?
We should be fighting on the same side, not against each other.
But enough of politics.
Very pretty.
Strong features.
Girlfriend?
Wife?
Awaiting the return of her hero husband?
Pity...
...if I were to...
Tell me exactly when the Allies plan to take back these islands.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Well, that is a soldier's lot on lonely outposts such as this.
- No!
- Soon she will be gone.
Who is she?
I have my duty.
Please.
- She's Helena.
My wife.
She was my wife.
April 1941, in London, there was an air raid.
Shelter was hit. Hundreds were buried.
I went to help.
We found only mangled corpses, women and children.
I made it home in the early hours of the morning. Our hou...
Our house had been hit.
And...
I dug again, this time alone.
And I found her.
What was left of her.
I never got to say goodbye.
This war has taken its toll on all of us.
- You say that as if you're not responsible.
- I am just a soldier, like you.
- No.
No, not like me.
Ah!
: I told you...
We're both in the same shit.
We could've helped each other.
- What could I possibly help you with, Meyer?
Torturing female prisoners?
Murdering your own men?
What kind of lunatic Special Action Unit did they pull you out of?
Jews and Gypsies not enough for you?
- I've already told you...
None of those men died by my hand.
That prisoner, she is not what you think she is.
- Sorry, Joe.
: Please, help me. Please.
Please, help me.
- It's safe.
- Don't...
You're safe now.
I can take you from here.
There's a submarine off the coast.
We can get to it.
Jesus! Jesus Christ!
Ben...
- Helena...
No... No, you're dead.
- Please...
There isn't time to explain.
The German, he'll be back.
Don't leave me here with him.
Don't let him touch me.
- How... How can this be?
- Ben! You've got to get me free.
You've got to unlock this chain!
- You were so...
You were so torn.
You-you-you were broken.
You, uh...
I held you in my arms.
- Ben... pull yourself together.
This is real. I promise.
There's a key... downstairs.
You must find it.
- Don't think about releasing her.
There's a good chap.
- What in God's name is going on here?!
- Nothing in God's name,
I can assure you of that.
Now, please, step away from her.
- Ben, help...
- Silence, you hag!
That creature is not who you think she is.
- How is she here?
- That Luger had... only three rounds left.
By my count, you are out of bullets.
You don't believe? Shoot me.
- Drop the Schmeisser.
Kick it here.
- An officer and a gentleman to the last.
How boring.
Ah!
I need you alive.
No!
Bastard!
What the fuck did you just do, you Nazi bastard?
: I've saved your life.
She'd have killed you if you'd set her free.
Listen to me.
I have information.
A weapon...
...more dangerous than anything you can imagine.
- You lying bastard!
- Kill me... and you'll never know.
- Talk!
- That creature...
She's part of it.
- Bullshit.
I can prove it.
- No. Your turn to die.
- Please, I beg you.
- You lie to me and I'll cut your fuckin' balls off, and gut you like a pig, you understand?
What the fuck is going on here?
How can Helena be here?
Tell me.
- She's not your dead wife.
Ugh... Please tell me you believe that.
I am Colonel Meyer of the SS Germanorden.
How many soldiers have the blood tattoo?
How many soldiers carry papers of that nature?
You must understand, the Führer has long been obsessed with the occult.
He set up the SS Germanorden, a specialist unit dedicated to scouring the world for... mystical materials.
I was sent here on... a highly secret mission.
The outcome which c... could affect the entire war.
These islands you're so keen to save... you know, they have something of a reputation.
- For what?
- Witchcraft.
What on earth do... do you think we're dealing with here?
You may see her as your dead Helena.
I see my loving Gretta, who is still very much alive in Hamburg.
That soldier...
That was Lieutenant Otto Schillmann.
A good soldier, until his girlfriend tried to use his intestines as a necklace.
- Enough of this fairytale bullshit.
- That is how they died.
Each one.
Ripped apart and devoured by someone they thought was the love of his life.
- Ah... you really are insane.
- The platoon stationed here were starving.
They hadn't been supplied for weeks, reduced to foraging for food.
They found... an abandoned cottage.
A ruin.
There they found something.
A book.
Have you heard of the Grimoires?
- The what?
- In the Middle Ages, witches were more feared on these islands than in any other part of the British Isles.
They drew their power from a series of ancient texts.
Grimoires.
Bad books.
Whose purpose was the invocation of demonic forces.
Allow me to prove it.
I will show you the true nature of this horror.
I need your knife.
Come, demon bitch.
You can cease pretending.
I know you need your meat.
See?
- Jesus Christ, Meyer.
What have you done?
: Benjamin?
: Do not implore his help, demon.
I've shown him what you are.
- My love... I'm your Helena.
Surely you can see.
- Isn't this what you really seek?
- I am no animal to be chained.
Release me, and the forces I serve will grant you powers beyond your wildest dreams.
- So said Lucifer in the desert to Our Lord Jesus Christ.
- Ah! Surely that holy name turns to poison in your mouth, Nazi.
- You cannot divide us, demon.
I will send you back to the darkness.
Treat this as your last meal.
I present your loving wife.
I will show you everything, Grogan.
How I summoned... this monster.
And how we will dispel it.
Ugh...
: Ben...
Don't leave me.
- Be warned... Captain Grogan.
If I die, you lack the knowledge to send that creature back to Hell.
- You be warned, there's no morphine.
This is gonna hurt... a lot.
: Oh, God!
Christ's blood!
- Keep bloody still!
: Oh, God!
Christ's blood!
Ah...
- Colonel?
Don't die on me now, not after the trouble I've been through.
: Ben...?
Ben? Are you down there, darling?
I know you're listening.
I can replace her, Ben.
I can be Helena.
Release me from this chain.
Release me, and I will take my place beside you.
- Do demons sleep, Colonel?
- Who knows?
When incarnate on earth, when clothed in living flesh--
- Yeah, spare me.
- She is Femme-Varou.
- What?
- Femme-Varou.
That is her real identity.
May I?
In mythology, the Femme-Varou are shape-shifters.
She is a carnivore.
A desecrator of human flesh.
But she comes with a beautiful and familiar face, to confuse and deceive her victims.
- You... summoned one.
- I had orders to test... the book.
- On fellow German soldiers?
- All war involves sacrifice.
An island like this is perfect.
This particular demon cannot cross flowing waters.
Even if she'd killed us all, she would be trapped here.
- But she didn't kill you all.
One does not summon demons...
...without the means to defend oneself against them.
Whoever carries the words contained within that pouch will be safe from her.
Against them she is forbidden to cause mortal harm and has no more strength than a normal woman.
- Let me guess.
There's only one of these.
- I'll admit, I was not prepared for the viciousness of her attack, or the extent of her appetite.
But she killed so many...
It's unfortunate.
But what a... what a weapon she is, spawned in Hell itself.
Imagine if she were unleashed in London, deceiving and slaughtering her way to Churchill himself.
She would... she would make Jack the Ripper look like a kindergarten tale.
She cannot be killed by mortal means.
She can only be bound in iron.
But that... will only hold her for so long.
She can be dismissed back to the netherworld, but only by the knowledge contained in there.
And trust me, she is just a lesser demon.
There are far worse than her in that book.
Help me... and the book is yours.
- Why?
Why would you do that?
- I love my country, but I'm not blind to the atrocities she's committed, nor am I comfortable with what will happen if she wins.
Perhaps it is... better if the righteous prevail.
- And what's the price of betraying your country?
- A deal.
Immunity from prosecution for myself, my wife smuggled out of Germany, new lives and a new identity for both of us.
In return...
I will educate your leaders in the dark secrets of this book.
- Why don't I just take this book and kill you?
- A brave soldier returning to rave of demons and witchcraft?
How many occult experts do you have in your army, Captain Grogan?
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!
- How long was I unconscious?
- An hour, maybe longer.
: God in Heaven!
The garrison on Guernsey is sending a boat to collect me at dawn.
We must escape before they arrive.
- What about her?
- She is trapped on this island, but she is a denizen of Hell.
Who knows the strength of her powers?
For our own safety, we must dispel the demon now.
- How?
- The ritual.
It requires two of us.
The pouch. I need it.
Captain Grogan, do you have any idea with what you're dealing with here?
There are rules.
Without those words kept close to my skin,
I cannot complete the ritual.
You must trust me.
Get the candles.
- Ben? Look at me.
- Do not look at it.
- You've been swayed against your will.
- You must cut me, then yourself.
A blood sacrifice is required.
Now yours.
Do you willingly give all that I ask of you in this cause?
- Yes.
- We must be very clear on this.
- Yes.
- You have not been coerced?
- No, I willingly give.
- Then spill your blood.
: No!
- Downstairs! Quickly!
- For God's sake, there's no lock!
- We must get downstairs!
- And that'll hold her?!
- Just long enough! Go!
Make space!
We must draw a double-edged circle to protect us both.
Hurry! Now!
Stop!
Do not stand on or over the circle.
Exit and enter only through that gap.
Once everything is prepared, we will seal the circle from inside.
More candles. Now!
Baal.
Xaphan.
Samael.
Lilith.
Lucifer.
White candles around the circle.
Give me the knife!
Damn it, man!
Our lives depend on it!
The Flesh of Mankind harnessed.
The Bone of Mankind harnessed.
The Mind of Mankind harnessed.
Stay inside the circle.
If you value your life, do not leave it.
We are ready.
Let the demon bitch assail us.
- Joe?
- Ugh?
- Shacked up with the enemy, Ben? Ha!
- No, no. Joe...
- It's not real, Grogan.
Stay in the circle!
- After all those missions.
After all the boys we lost.
- It's not real.
Ha!
There's nothing there.
It's just an apparition.
A trick.
Nothing more.
- Why don't you start?
- The demon must be present.
- Why would she come down here if this will harm her?
- She will come down here because she is hungry and we are the freshest meat, the tastiest dish on the table.
- What the hell is going on?
- Quiet.
- What were you expecting, my love?
The Devil?
- Don't listen to it.
- Ah!
Efficient and organized.
Haven't you wondered why I'm attempting to entice you rather than him?
- He knows what you are.
Does he?
- And I know you, too.
: No, you do not!
: See, Grogan?
This demon cannot abide defiance.
This is the truth of it.
The abomination that seeks to seduce you.
: I wonder, Captain Grogan, do you really consider you've backed the right horse here?
These goblins in black uniform plan to enslave your world.
Do you wish to hand them the means on a plate?
: Do not listen to it.
- Their leader has long been searching for so-called wonder weapons, magical items with which he will kill your people... in multitudes.
He already holds the Holy Lance.
He had within his grasp the Ark of the Covenant.
He tried to awaken the Great Old Ones.
And now he has within his reach the power to summon Lucifer himself.
: Do not listen, Grogan.
It will try to divide us.
- I've laid bare my true self,
Captain Grogan.
Has he?
- I compel thee by the three most dreadful and mighty names of Inferno,
Abaddon, Ob and Astaroth!
How long is this gonna take?
- I must incant the dismissal for as long as necessary, to weaken it.
- It doesn't seem to be getting any weaker to me.
But I am, Ben. I am.
- I curse thee into the depths of the Bottomless Pit!
- I'll be gone from this world if you allow him to proceed.
- There to remain in unquenchable fire and brimstone until the Day of Wrath!
- Do you wish to lose me forever?
- Until thou be obedient and fulfil my will and commandment once more!
- There were happy occasions weren't there, my love?
In the short time that we had.
- I command thee, demon, who art wicked and disobedient!
- When you held me, kissed me, made love to me...
- Helena...
- Her name is not Helena!
She is a She-Devil!
A Femme-Varou!
- I've followed all your battles.
- I curse thee into the depths of the Bottomless Pit!
- North Africa...
Greece...
Italy...
- There to remain in unquenchable fire and brimstone until the Day of Wrath!
- Always in the front line.
Driven beyond reason by a desire to be with me again.
You don't have to do that now, my love.
I'm here for you.
Come to me.
- Grogan, in God's name!
Do not break the circle!
- Have you missed me, my love?
: Until thou be obedient and fulfil my will and commandment once more!
- I can be this way for you always.
- I command thee, demon, who art wicked and disobedient!
Don't be a fool, Grogan!
Don't let her deceive you!
She's a devil, a desecrator!
- Listen to him, spewing his bile.
- I command thee in the names of Peor and Nyarlathotep!
I compel thee by the three most dreadful and mighty names of the Inferno,
Abaddon, Ob, Astaroth!
- Do you know why I'm not desecrating your flesh, my sweet?
- Hear ye, fallen ones, dead names, lords of the Netherrealm!
Receive back into thy clutches this prodigal beast who is condemned to return to thee!
- Why I'm not devouring your soul?
- Balor!
Choronzon!
Adramelech!
Chancellors of all the darkness!
- The flesh of a good man is rank to me.
- Be bound and obey my command!
- The flesh of an evil man...
Give me the Nazi and you're spared.
- No... No, I need him.
- Be bound and obey my command!
- You poor fool.
Be bound and obey...
- Look.
- ...my command!
: You son of a bitch!
- Fuck you, Hell whore!
Did you honestly believe... a loyal servant of Germany would hand you over the book and betray his country?
As a willing sacrifice, you are now the agent of our success.
And when I'm recognized as the architect of this triumph,
I will rise and sit beside Hitler himself.
All I need now is the power contained within the power of a brave and beating heart.
And that is the role you play, Grogan.
How fortunate that you came here to embrace your destiny.
- You'll create Hell on earth.
- We already have.
- Time you saw the real one.
: Give him to me!
- No, please.
- Give him to me!
Embrace your own fucking destiny!
- No! You can't harm me!
- The deceiver deceived.
At last we are together, my sweet.
Did I not warn you of the price when first you imprisoned me?
You, who have butchered so many... you're still novices in the game of death.
- I compel thee, demon, be bound and obey my command!
Are you trying to dismiss me?
I thought you liked me.
- Stay back.
- Oh, look.
Some thoughtful person has built a little bridge for me.
- I compel thee, demon, be bound and obey my command!
I command thee, demon...
- Ben, your hand is hurt.
Let me look at it.
Let me.
Ben...
Darling...
You still fear me?
- Yes.
- But...
I believe your yearning for Helena is stronger, yeah?
Huh?
Ah...
What's wrong, my love?
- You think I don't know my own Helena?
- Ben...
- Her taste? Her smell?
- Ben...
- You can never replace her.
: No!
You cannot do this to me!
You wish to make an enemy of me for eternity?
Unchain me now!
You bastard son of Adam!
You're no better than the ones you despise, the ones you fight against.
- You should be thanking me.
Every one of those German sailors coming has a wife or a lover.
And all the others after them.
Plenty of fresh meat for ya.
- And when there are no more lambs to the slaughter?
- We'll return, send you back to where you belong.
- How the righteous have fallen.
- Ah, the enemy must be stopped.
This war must be won.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!
- Quickly. They're coming.
- Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!
: Hello? Colonel Meyer?
My God.
: Oh, my God.
Franz, is that really you?
Franz, Franz. It's me, Nicole.
- Nicole? How?
What's... what's going on?
Where did you come from?
- Where did I come from?
From Hell, dear.
: From Hell.

...THE FINAL OFFICIAL LUNAR LANDS
ON THE MOON
IN 2011, 84 HOURS OF CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE
...IS UPLOADED TO WWW.LUNARTRUTH.COM
THIS FILM WAS EDITED FROM
THAT FOOTAGE
This's a lot of at stake here, you know.
Talking, nation versus nation.
The race's still on.
It's a lot to discover up there.
I guess the call came in on a Friday.
They've never been to a barbecue.
JOHN GREY COMMAND MODULE PILOT
Just few beers you know, or more than a few.
Could Vince's cooking, he definitely need few.
Nate took the call from Milton.
And Milton said, "Eighteen is back on"
But it was classified D.O.D., top secret.
Asked him "are you OK with that?
And it was like "are you kidding me?"
I come from a family military pilots.
Duty can sometimes pound on private life.
Make choices. Keep going forward.
NASA already has like 800 pounds rocks.
Nathan Walker; Mission Commander
So why we need more, I don't know,
...but, hey, if it means a trip to the moon.
Placing cameras, we have these
Westinghouses all over the place.
Well, I think the way it's been explained is...
...they're using a Saturn 5 to launch classified D.O.D payload.
...which's meant to be very large very heavy and...
...apparently unmanned.
Apparently.
Placing these high frequency transmitters because...
...really warning anti-missile defense system of Soviyet Union.
These PSD 5 are kind of like high-tech radar scanners.
They should pick up and track anything we can't.
To keep an eye on the Russian's air.
It would be nice to tell my wife.
Benjamin Andersen-Lunar Module Pilot
Or been by my side whole time and then.
She thinks I'm doing training exercise with the Japanese space agency.
Brian, my boy, it would be nice to tell him his father's going to the moon.
I'd love brought to him a souvenir.
Maybe, a moonrock.
I don't know, may be one day.
Ben was always the first in his class.
And I was always running at his heels.
I mean, I'm jealous that he will walk on the moon with Nate...
...while I'm alone in an orbit flight.
My job is essentially to make sure
I'm bringing us home safely.
Look, let's face it. These missions are result-oriented.
And we can't afford the failure you know, can we?
Things can go wrong... things to go wrong happen.
These things you're gonna push them out of your mind.
It's just not an option.
I'm proud to do for these guys, and proud to do for my country.
Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, two, one.
Apollo 18, it looks good.
Christmas lights.
- Bring the Christmas lights back?
- I don't know. Not me.
- Have you seen anything like that before?
- No, sorry.
It's amazing.
The earth in all her glory.
There is a good-looking boy.
You sure he's yours?
Watch it.
He's a good kid.
It has a large space to fill.
Play on Moon Boots.
Nate, you've waited all this time to put your foot on the moon...
...and you need to be number 13.
How do you feel about that?
Are you gonna be OK with staying behind John?
Oh, you know, would be nice to have some alone times here.
It's crowded in here.
I keep a light on for you boys.
Don't stay out until late.
- In a couple days.
- Roger that.
See you in a couple days.
Houston, this is Freedom. We're preparing to unboard the Liberty.Over.
OK,18. you can go front dock in four minutes.
John, is the tunnel vented?
Roger that. The tunnel is vented.
OK, we are ready. We'll send you an updated state background on that.
Roger Houston. We're coding the data.
The computer is all yours.
I wish you come with us, John.
- Now, you be careful down there.
- Don't worry about it
- Got a good visual around here
- OK, 18. You're ready for that.
We go to the moon.
1400 feet.
44 down.
OK, good. Down to 1000 feet.
54 LPD.
20 feet down. Repeat, 20 feet down.
OK, good.
Mission Elapsed Time:
Four days, 6 hours and 33 minutes.
Roger.
Here we are.
Take it down.
- Carefull with the line. Over.
- Where?
After that next crater.
4 o'clock.
It seems pretty rocky area. Mark it.
430 feet.
Down 15.
Houston, we have a program alarm
- You have go to 1201 Liberty.
- Roger. Go to 1201.
Do you want to take about reversing that approach?
Negative. We miss the window.
The moon isn't...
- We're closing now. Three, two, one.
- How does it look?
- We're coming in too fast.
- Try to stabilize.
Negative Houston.
The range is long. We go to manual.
- Contact Light.
- Standby everyone.
Stay. No stay.
Stay where you are Liberty.
Houston, give that man a cigar.
- Looks great.
- Excellent landing.
You talking to me or to Nate?
I'm talking you both, kid.
25 December, 1974.
EMD... 4 days nine hours, 23 minutes.
Commander, Nathan Walker.
Ministry of Defense, Mission Report 1A.
For day one of our two-day mission...
This is Thomas Young of
Apollo Mission Control.
- Managed to move our 16 mm cameras.
- Copy.
Looks like 5 reels 10,000 feet
Kodachrome.
Houston, we're prepared for OA1.
Copy Liberty. You are go for decompression chamber.
But not good boys.
We don't want anyone catching cold.
- Copy that.
- Copy that.
I look after him.
Hope that the hose is long enough.
Houston...
...we take now the first step on the South Pole.
I had prepared a speech but
I don't have much audiences anyway.
Do not worry about it.
You will have opportunity soon.
There are rock formations everywhere.
The sun is low on the horizon.
Maybe.
Freedom, do you hear?
Freedom receiving you loud and clear,
Liberty. Over.
Yeah, yeah, perfect.
You call that a salute?
OK. Let me get a shot of you with that LEM in the background.
It's more like a naval salute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got to get this.
I promised Lauren and Brian
Christmas to spend with them.
This's all going back to the
Department of Defense.
We're placing Westinghouse cams.
WESTINGHOUSE MOTION
DETECTION CAMERA
Sounds good, Nate.
Standby.
Motion cencor is tracking you perfectly, Nate
Captain says that we will test the audio when you get back.
I'm checking the payload in the missile unit.
What was that?
Houston, need check that panel for anything that interferences.
Roger. You need to walk to procedure location 1 and initiate the procedure.
Copy. We're on our way.
Hey, take a look at that.
Makes you think, doesn't it?
It's dusty.
Leave the camera here, so you get better view Tommy.
It's hard to believe that the sun never shines in some places.
Careful now, fellows.
If you are in any of those craters, you can call to her
- PSD5 in place.
- Copy that.
You recorded signal frequency on the PSD5 in your training?
- It was without that, wasn't it?
- I thought, it was.
I think they have changed it.
That's the coordinates: 4.3 on Z and...
Inititating sequence is completed.
If we gonna get noise from the high tech again?
Don't worry.
A good geological sample and what appears to be...
...an impact crater.
Samples feel...
...strange.
Let's get out of here.
EMD...four days,
14 hours and 48 minutes.
Commander Nathan Walker.
D.o.D mission report 3C.
Day 1, DVA 1 complete.
I'm starving.
What's the menu tonight?
- Carrots or peas?
- I'll take carrots.
- Get the peas.
- Perfect.
I am many proud of you boys.
- You have good time out there?
- You know we have.
There is much noise in this frequency.
See if I can isolate it.
Cleared up a little bit.
Copy that.
Astronaut Brian Anderson, with his dad, flies through space.
- Honey, what are you doing?
- Just playing mom.
Don't play with your dad's stuff.
- Is this a recording?
- I'm sorry, Dad. I love you.
Beverley is in panic because hairdresser appointment ran over.
Stan and Gene already over, nothing is ready, so...
I offered to help in cutting the peppers.
Couple minutes later I'm in the bathroom taking a leak...
...and with all these peppers in my hands...
Next thing I know, my crotch is on fire.
- So, I'm in the bathroom howling in pain.
- They can not hear you.
They all heard me.
Stan's wife is a nurse, so... she sends me back into the bathroom, with a cup of milk.
Hey, I guess you're about to tell me that you have your balls in a glass of milk?
- Hey, no knock it. It works.
- Jalapeno dick!
I can't believe that you've never heard that story?
- Beverly's back to Miami?
- Yes. I heard that.
Hear, you divorced because you snore, right?
I do not snore.
Every time!
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
- Bumped your head?
- Again!
It's big head.
Good night guys.
Great first day.
- Good night, JD.
- Never should told you that, litle prick.
- Nate?
- Yeah, I hear it.
- What can that be here?
- Give me a second.
Should be on the cam.
What is that?
- Hear that?
- Yes.
I don't think it comes from here.
It does not sound right.
- I can't find down here.
- It's army.
You think this interference can be coming from the PSD5?
We don't see any obvious.
We double check with the D.o.D.
We'll look into it.
You go get some sleep.
I am up.
Turn off the noise.
Good morning, Liberty. We took care of the interference a couple hours ago.
It should be OK now.
Do you get ready for OA2?
EMD... five days, 8 hours and 34 minutes.
And I'm Ben Anderson.
I need to document this.
Nate says he never snores in his sleep.
I got proof.
Hello boys, just to let you know...
...Freedom, we're going to around the corner to the back side.
- No communication a while.
- Roger that.
- I've made you breakfast.
- What do I got?
- Scrambled eggs.
- Again.
- What do you got?
- A delicious hamsbread.
It's all yours.
Just like Mom makes.
Hey, did you remove one of my samples?
One of my samples is on the ground.
What does that mean, Ben?
I don't know.
I bagged and tagged everything.
Look, let's go back in there giving a scoop.
Oh, damn! This one is contaminated.
- I don't understand. How did it get here?
- I don't know.
- This's really bad. How did it get here?
- I don't know.
D.o.D's checked around the interference with the first payload.
So found diagnostics...
Houston, do you copy?
- There is no communication.
- Probably get some blokage.
I see some big craters.
Five days, ten hours, 40 minutes since we left off.
I'm commander Nathan Walker.
We are on DVA 2.
Initiating day 2 receiver cell.
Activated PSD5 transmission signal to go.
Houston, do you copy?
This is Liberty. Over.
Still down.
There's something with that frequency.
Communication can't be down like that.
- Not for this like the time.
- Where are you going?
What the hell?
- Nate.
- What is it?
- Tracks.
- What?
That's impossible.
These are not ours.
EMD... five days, 11 hours, 7 minutes.
Alan P. Anderson.
Houston, this is 18.
Do you copy?
Houston, it's 18.
Do you hear?
John is on the back side.
No communication with him either.
Let's see where they lead.
- Impact Crater.
- Feel that?
Yeah, temperature's dropped.
Look at the footprints.
It makes no sense.
Like it runs in circles.
Disoriented.
- How should you do that?
- I don't know.
They go from this direction.
Come over here.
Holly shit!
- It is Russians.
- What the hell?
How can be Russians on the moon and nobody know about them?
We are on the moon and nobody knows about it.
Something is not right.
I'll look inside.
The lights are out.
Somebody's lost it in here.
Everything is crashed.
Their system isn't different from ours.
The power is on.
Oxygen reserve is good.
I can't tell whether they fully operational though.
- Where the hell did they go?
- I don't know.
- I want to take a look around.
- Stay close.
Those Russians could be anywhere.
What the hell?
There is blood. A lot of blood.
Someone's got hurt pretty bad.
I don't like this.
I think I see something inside the crater.
I'll go down.
Wait, Ben. The suits are no ready for that kind of cold.
No cape. The crater is so deep.
It's so cold.
I'll see around.
The ground is different.
It is soft.
Get out of there.
Oh, my god!
It's so cold.
Get out of there.
Ben!
OK, I'm get out of here.
Holy shit!
It's a dead cosmonaut.
I'm on my way up.
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm get to go.
What happened here?
- Maybe the other cosmonaut?
- Do you think killed him?
- There is a crack.
- What are you doing?
Get your head out of there.
Wait. Something..
What the hell was that?
It's a rock.
Have it in his jacket down here.
I don't know.
Let's get out of here.
We're on the point of no turning back.
If we don't go now, we're just as dead.
- I don't like someone has died up here.
- I know.
This is a secure line.
I'm just talking to you, right Tommy?
You're just talking to me.
The Russians have been to the moon.
Say that again?
The Russians have landed on the South Pool.
We've found their LK Proton lander.
It has not ended well for the cosmonauts.
- We find the crash of the Russians?
- They didn't crashed.
- We found his body in a crater.
- You found a dead cosmonaut?
Somebody didn't know this?
We landed less than 2 clicks of the Soviets, OK?
You still believe they did not know we were here.
We know they scrapped a manned flight programme in '69.
That was the official word.
Did you know they were here?
Tommy?
This is a D.o.D mission Nate.
I'm just bringing down what I need to know. That's all I can tell you.
Say that prick from the D.o.D to give me a call.
Get some rest. I get the go D.o.D over here and talk to you soon.
Tommie is straight here.
I knew something's wrong from the beginning.
OK, what do you think?
D.o.D's taken over.
Lying to our families.
And the Russians up here for what?
To set up some listening devices?
I don't know.
That makes no sense.
Come on, think about Watergate, Nate.
That was our president for God's sake.
And you don't think the
D.o.D which is lie to us?
So what are we doing up here?
What we're really doing?
This can be spooky a little.
Strange beauty in the backside.
I do not know if my mind plays tricks on me...
...but every so often you go to those little windows...
...get this sense as if something is looking back.
Looking back to you.
Nate, look at this.
- What?
- Look at this!
The flag is gone.
- This isn't right.
- Houston, this is 18. Over.
Houston, Liberty.
Did you see anything unusual in the
Westinghouse last night?
We had some interferences.
Our flag has gone.
Repeat again.
Repeat once.
Maybe the other cosmonaut took it.
If there is another cosmonaut...
...he would need oxygen for minimum 10 to 12 hours.
- What do you think, John?
- There is no way.
He can not carry that much.
So, how can he survive?
Maybe there is not a 'he'.
You're saying the Soviet flew one man mission?
- It would not be the first time.
- One cosmonaut...
But who took the flag?
Who killed the other cosmonaut we found?
Please get the D.o.D online.
Now.
We suspect that the Soviets are there, but we have no confirmation.
The Intelligence warned that they might be...
...disguising the machines as routine satellite launches.
Why the hell did not you tell us?
National security.
We carried out the card pretty close to the desk. No other option.
I'm sure you can understand.
Maybe a little too close.
We were concerned that they might ride to the sky first.
That would be a national security disaster.
So, where the hell is the other cosmonaut?
They're just gonna leave him here?
Our intelligence suggests there was only one cosmanaut.
Oh, God!
The mission is complete.
Time to get you boys home again.
So, that's it?
First we return home and ask questions later.
- What was that?
- Let's get out of here.
It looks pretty good.
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.
Wait for my mark.
- Eight...
- Time to go home.
Seven, six...
- That's the alarm.
- We can't go. No go. We are no go.
Save this damn thing.
I try.
I got a power glitch.
Use the spare oxygen.
- We have a leak somewhere.
- I try to isolate the tanks.
See if I can stop it.
Houston, do you copy?
Houston, do you copy?
We lost communication.
Dropped out. Closed.
- No, no.
- What the hell is going on?
Houston, this is Liberty. Over.
We just lost communication.
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.
Maybe hit the LEM, or a meteor rain.
There's no way no tell.
I'm gonna to the air.
Are you sure about this?
We need communication to get home.
You just stay here and wait.
- Look, I served in the army...
- Shut up.
Go down the platform.
Nothing on the bottom.
EMD...Six days.
13 hours, 46 minutes.
Commander Walker is performing an unplanned DVA...
...to repair the antenna on the Roover.
We experience...we experience some unexplained...
...malfunctions.
The whole installation seems damaged.
Could be the brief impact but I don't see any meteor residue.
- This reaped to pieces.
- Something crashed it?
I can't tell.
We get the same sound each time we activated the communication..
- Go to a different frequency.
- Frequency is blocked.
I never heard anything like it.
Wait. Wait.
Nate, talk to me. What do you see?
Footprint tracks.
Footprints?
Maybe there is another cosmonaut.
No.
Mission Duration:
Six days, 13 hours, 47 minutes.
Commander Nathan Walker.
We witness tracks that could be evidence of extraterrestial contact.
We witness tracks that could be evidence of extraterrestial contact.
Do you know what you're saying?
These tracks are not human.
I found the flag.
It's shreded.
And the motion censor camera gone.
That looks OK.
I'm turning the Roover back up.
The connection looks good.
Try contact to Houston or Freedom.
Freedom, copy?
Houston, do you copy?
Dammit.
- No, looks not working.
- OK. Let me try something.
Wait.
- Something is moving.
- What?
- I don't see anything
- There's something in my boots.
It's in my helmet.
- OK, listen to me. Go back to the lab.
- I can't get it out!
- Listen.Go back to the lab. OK?
- I can't get it out.
There is nothing inside your suit.
Go back to the ship.
It's in my helmet.
Don't take it out!
Nate!
Jesus Christ!
Nate!
Nate!
Nate!
You need oxygen.
Come on Nate! Keep moving.
We're almost there.
Keep moving.
Almost there. Come on.
Come on. Almost there.
Pull yourself up.
The door is closed.
Cabin press auto,
4.5 psi.
You don't get enough oxygen.
Breathe! Breathe!
One.
Look at me in the eye.
You'll be fine.
Two.
Two and a half.
The cabin pressure is stable.
It's okay.
So, you OK?
I'm fine.
What happened out there?
You've started screaming, I've come out there and you're on your back.
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you hear me?Over.
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you hear me?
We hear you, John. Over.
I can't receive the Liberty, Tommy.
Copy that Freedom.
We have the same problem down here.
Have you tried to change the frequency?
No. We had some sort of interference.
Could have something to do with those PSD5.
We are not sure yet that PDS5 are the source of the problem.
I want to switch shut down the receivers to see what happened.
Negative.
Why not? We got two men down there Tommy. Come on.
Tommy?
Are you there?
We are working on the problem.
We'll keep you adviced.
Oh, you're working on it.
That's great.
God damn it.
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?
EMD...
Six days, 16 hours, 12 minutes.
Post DVA 1,5 hours with Commander Walker
I've already told everything
I remember.
Come on.
Are you paranoid, Ben?
I thought I saw something...
I thought I saw something on the corner of my eye. I was wrong...
...and then there was a shrieking voice...
...and caught off guard.
I must have hit a rock.
That's it.
You said something was in your helmet.
You yelled.
I don't remember that.
Christ! You're bleeding.
Look at your shirt.
You bleed.
Jeez.
Take the first aid kit.
You said that something was inside your suit.
That's what you said.
You said inside your helmet.
I wonder how did you get that wound.
If there is something in your suit, where the hell did it go?
Wait a second.
Nate, I can feel it right here.
Oh, man! Something's inside.
- What are you talking about?
- Look, it's just below the skin.
I need to get that out. OK?
Yeah. OK.
Just make it quick.
Everything is right.
Hang in there!
Damn, it seems to be moving.
Get it out.
- I got it! I got it!
- Get it out!
Jesus!
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes.
Put this on it.
It looks like one of my samples.
You said you felt something's moving in your helmet.
I don't understand, how did this get in...
Goddamn, you contaminated the entire ship.
Liberty, do you copy?
Houston, we hear you.
Liberty, do you copy?
Dammit Houston, we hear you.
Liberty, do you receive?
They can't hear us.
Liberty, do you hear?
Those PSD5's...
...what if they're not there to spy on the Russians?
What do you mean?
They told us that the transmitters...
...pick up any frequency, but they don't.
They're blocking our communication, transmitting a signal.
Alright.
And why would they do that?
No, keep filming. Keep filming.
We need to document this.
To attract the Soviets, made the tracks is
...whatever killed the cosmonaut.
All these cameras, man...
...they're watching us.
We are alone.
We are guinea pigs.
That's why they sent us here.
We have to turn off those transmitters.
PSD5's destroyed.
Brilliant.
Nice tracks.
They were here.
Let's check on the other sides.
Liberty, do you copy?
Liberty, do you copy?
Liberty, do you copy?
Something's down here.
It's gone.
Hey, what are you looking at?
This was a bad idea.
You need to get rest, Nate. OK?
We're get to back to lab.
We need to get back, Nate.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Nate.
It's in your blood stream.
The previous wound seems to...
...become infected.
Eyes are extremely bloodshot.
I do not know how to treat it.
Houston, this is Freedom.
I haven't be able to reach Nate or Ben.
Communication's still down with Liberty.
We have no communication with the crew...
...we're receiving data from the LEM.
We're trying to restore the communication now. Standby.
Liberty, this is Houston.
Looks like you can hear us, but we can't hear you.
Block the Westinghouse and survival craft's getting land down.
We estimate 12 hours left on your live support...
...and we are now sorting out the engine problems.
We'll do everything we can to get you home.
... and we are now sorting out the engine problems.
We'll do everything we can to get you home.
They're lying.
No, they'll get us back.
Thay'll get us back.
They want that footage.
- What about the Russian ship?
- The poor Russian bastard.
It looks infected.
Just like me.
I'm getting worse.
Ben...
- ...you must leave me here.
- No.
- No one leaves anyone.
- You have to.
Forget it. We won't die uphere.
Fate has renamed.
The men who went to the moon to export peace...
...remained on the moon to rest in peace.
What the hell are you talking about?
I feel my toughts...fragmenting.
I can be attracted to them.
I'm so tired.
EMD
Six days, 22 hours, 23 minutes.
Alan B. Anderson. Doctorial
There were no further communication with Houston.
Oxygen levels are low.
Nate's being sleep for about an hour.
The sickness seems brougth fatigue.
We're not gonna make it here.
If Houston doesn't come up with the plans in the next couple hours, we'll..
...we'll abandon Liberty and go to the Russian LK.
Their communications and oxygen are our only hope.
Just pray to God.
Jesus Christ!
Jesus!
Partial respiration.
Upper left rib...
The infection's spreading.
God damn it.
Must be the same thing that happened to the Russian.
- Nate!
- I don't let you kill me!
It's me. Listen to me. Look at me.
It's me. Ok?
I'm just trying to help you.
You're getting worse.
Don't ever touch me!
- Nate, please, what the hell are you doing?
- They are everywhere.
- Please, Nate, you'll kill us all!
- Stop watch us!
Nate!
You're not gonna watch how I die!
What are you doing? Stop!
Stop!
Come on! You...
Stop there!
Stop that!
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?
Liberty, this is Freedom.
I don't know if you hear me, but
I'm gonna be in the comm range soon.
Guys, we need to get you out of there. There is...
Do you copy?
Come on, guys,
Don't make me leave you here.
Freedom, you read us?
John...John, can you hear me?
Please, anyone... can you hear me?
We are leaving Liberty.
- Come on.
- I had to do it.
Take the camera.
We have 25% of the tank.
We can use some reserv.
We'll get there.
I get to get the films.
Black box of the D.o.D
I get to go down.
It's clear.
Come Nate, we go.
They are everywhere.
You can't help me.
You don't have to be here.
That's OK.
- It's gonna be OK.
- Alright. We're gonna make it.
They're waiting for me.
We are not safe here.
- Get rid of me.
- Hang in.
What the hell are you doing?
Hang on!
Nate!
Nate!
EMD
I don't know...
Roover has been destroyed.
There is no sign of Commander Walker.
American astronaut,
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.
Oxygen is getting low.
I'm...
I'm gonna search for the Russian later.
Hey, Commander Walker.
Nate!
Go away from here, Ben.
This is where they're coming from.
There's nothing here, OK?
You get to come with me.
God damn it! We need get moving.
Ben, listen to me.
We're running out of time here, please.
You must find the LK? Their system is identical with ours. Save yourself.
No, Nate! I'm not going.
You're coming with me.
You have to leave me here.
Just get the John.
- I'm not leaving here!
- You can't help me.
But you can save yourself...
Nate!
Nate!
Can you hear me?
Nate!
Answer me!
Do you hear me?
Say something Nate.
Nate, where are you?
No! No!
My god. No!
John, Nate is gone.
Repeat, Nate is gone.
Please, can somebody hear me?
Oh, my God!
Nate!
Come on!
Frequency is completed.
This is an American astronaut.
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.
Been copy?
This is Apollo 18. Do you copy?
Anyone, do you copy?
Anyone, please. Do you copy?
Anything, anybody, do you copy?
Damn!
Confirming Commander Walker.
- Acknowledge.
- This is Captain Ben Anderson...
Do you copy?
This is Ben Anderson.
Copy, anybody?
Anybody, please! Do you read me?
Captain Anderson, this is the
Deputy Secretary of Defense.
What?
D.o.D? Yes.
Yes, this is Captain Ben Anderson.
We communicate with the Russians and they're putting me through you.
We're aware of your condition that...
...and we have decided.
- ...we can't you home.
- No. No, no!
Listen to me please.
Nate get a cut on his body. He's infected.
There's nothing on me. Please, have to come and get me.
We can't get you.
We can't get you.
Please...
Listen, I...I...got a family and I need my family.
We'll let your family know you died a hero.
I'm sorry Captain.
You have to get me out of here!
And you fucking do it right now!
I will not give up until you get me home!
Houston, please.
We'll stay in on this channel with you but the decision is final.
You've done a great service for your country, son.
EMD...
Still no communication.
Astronaut Brian Anderson, with his dad, flies through the space.
- Brian, what are you doing?
- Just playing, mom.
Do not play with the your dad's stuff.
- Is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad, I love you.
- Is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad, I love you.
...love you.
...Dad, I love you.
...love you.
This is Freedom, are you hearing me?
- This is Freedom...
- John, it's Ben. I hear you.
Ben, is that you?
Do you copy?
Yes, John, I am.
I hear you.
I got you on the VHF, partner.
Where the hell are you?
- Soviet's LK.
- Yes. Good for you.
They left me, John.
Left me here!
Where is Nate? How's he?
Get sick, he did not make it.
There's something down here, John.
And they knew about it. You hear me?
Those bastards knew about it!
Forget about the D.o.D, man.
Ben, I'm get you out of there, OK?
Did you figure out that thing?
I don't have much choice. Do we?
Powers look good.
And there is plenty fuel.
Okay, buddy. You're gonna be in the darkness yet...
...you're gonna need to get your synchronized orbit...
...then you need a little space for.
Safely on board.
How does that sound?
Sounds beautiful Johnny.
Sound very beautiful.
I don't mean rush you partner but we're running out of time.
Get that thing in the orbit.
We can run into it.
I got it! I got it, John.
Seven. Six.
Five.
- Holy shit!
- Open this door.
Nate, you know I can't do that.
Please, you'll kill us both!
I can't let you in.
- I'm coming there.
- No, no!
Nate, please!
- Nate, stop this Nate!
- What'd you mean? - It's Nate!
- What is happening?
- Come on buddy! Stop!
Stop!
- What's going on?
- Don't do this! -What do you think?
Jesus Christ! No!
Nate!
Nate!
Oh, my God!
Nate!
No!
No, no, no!
You can launch.
You must do it now.
Our window is almost gone.
You have to launch.
Dammit, they were kind of too close.
We're going home!
Ben, listen to me now.
We're going to go home.
Heard that? We're going to go home.
I'm going home.
We lifted up!
Freedom, do you read?
This is the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
Ben has been contaminated.
Do not try to rescue him.
I repeat. You will not recover him.
Contaminated by what?
D.o.D?
- What do you say? Where is Tommy?
- You will not recover Anderson.
This a direct order.
I'm on my way.
John, you're abording the rescue immediately.
Captain Anderson has been contaminated.
You knew something was down there and you sent them anyway!
I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.
D.o.D to Freedom
If you're not abording in 60 seconds...
...transmittion will be terminated.
You'll not receive updated statement.
You'll run out of life support craft and you'll not return home.
You have 45 seconds to abort the rescue.
John, we have no choice.
We're begging you. Do not rescue!
God damn it, Ben!
We're going home.
I'm in the orbit.
Ben!
They tricked me.
John, get out of here.
Ben, you're coming in too fast!
Ben, your impact, slow it down!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
According to all official reports
Apollo 17 was the final mission.
Official Report
LI. Colonel John Grey...
...was kiiled in a crash during a training mission over Tallahassee. FL.
His body was never recovered.
Official Report
Cmdr. Nathan Walker's F-14 crashed into...

His body was never recovered.
Official Report
Cpt. Benjamin Anderson was killed...
...was killed during a mid-air evacuation over the East China Sea.
His body was never recovered.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things.
Not because they are easy, but because they're hard.
Apollo Missions brought 378 kg Moon Rock
Samples To Earth.
Hundreds Were Given Away To
Dignitaries of Foreign Countries
Many of These "Gifts" Were Stolen or Are Now Missing
The voyages of Apollo dramatized the risks.
The men of Apollo identify the character...
...that accept the danger and surmounted.
There is the spirit that built America.
Show yourself!
I know you're out there.
Help!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Alas! Poor Yorick.
I knew him, Horatio.
A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He hath borne me on his back a thousand times, and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is!
My gorge rises at it.
Here hung those lips...
Excuse me.
This is a private party, miss.
My name is Gwen Conliffe, and I'm engaged to your brother, Ben.
Is Ben here?
No.
I'm afraid no one knows where Ben is, which is why I'm here.
Clive.
Well, boys and girls, let's repair to the tavern!
Good night, sweet prince.
I seem to recall,
Miss Conliffe...
I seem to recall he mentioned you in one of his letters.
And it's quite uncharacteristic of my brother to treat a lady in such a way, but the character of man is such a shiftable thing.
You misapprehend me.
Benjamin is missing from Blackmoor.
He's gone.
Did my father send you?
No, I'm here on my own.
It's been nearly a month since anyone has seen Ben, and we knew that you were in London.
I'd hoped you had received some word.
Why do you think he's in trouble?
Because the night he went missing, two villagers were killed.
Would you help us?
Miss Conliffe,
I am under contract for the next 30 performances.
If this is about your father,
I know how you feel.
Do you?
My company leaves for America tomorrow.
I simply can't help.
He is your brother.
Good night.
It must be a wonderful luxury, doing battle with imaginary demons,
Mr. Talbot.
Mine right now are very real.
Your mother?
Yes.
My oldest memories of my mother, we are gathering grapes in her father's vineyard.
It is my Garden of Eden.
You're paying yours a visit?
No, my mother died not long after this was made.
My father and my brother, they live near Blackmoor.
A man needs a good stick on the moor.
I purchased this one in Gévaudan lifetimes ago.
It's the work of a master silversmith.
Would you do me the honor?
It's beautiful.
It will give me great pleasure to know that it was the keeping of a civilized man.
Its heft is somewhat too much for me these days.
You're overly kind.
But I'm afraid
I must refuse it.
As you wish.
Hello?
Samson!
Lawrence?
Hello, Father.
Ah.
Lo and behold, the prodigal son returns.
I hope you're not expecting the fatted calf.
Stay!
We don't have many visitors.
You seem well.
I've often wondered what you look like.
You've come about your brother, have you?
Stay.
Yes.
Miss Conliffe learned that I was in London...
Samson.
...and sent me a letter saying that Ben has disappeared.
I thought I'd offer my help in any which way I can.
Yes, what a splendid idea, Lawrence.
A splendid idea.
Too late,
I'm afraid.
Unfortunately, your brother's body was found in a ditch by the priory road yesterday morning.
I assume you have something to wear for the funeral.
Sir John.
You remember my son, Lawrence?
Singh, my servant.
Master Lawrence.
It's nice to see you, Lawrence.
It's good that you're here.
Has Miss Conliffe been notified?
Mmm-hmm.
She's upstairs in her bedroom, asleep.
Where are they keeping Ben's body?
Your father instructed me to bury your brother's effects with him.
It seems a shame.
Thank you.
I wouldn't, sir. It's...
I missed his whole life.
MONTFORD: What if it wasn't a beast at all, but a cunning murderer?
Someone who bore a grudge against one of these men.
To misdirect the authorities, he kills the men, and then he tears up the bodies to make it look like a wild beast was responsible.
Ridiculous!
Who would go to such lengths?
What about that gypsy dancing bear?
It could have done it.
That mangy thing?
Kill three men?
I doubt it.
I saw the bodies with my own eyes.
Unnatural wounds.
Most unnatural.
Made by a fell creature,
I say.
Damn gypsies wandering the countryside, bringing their woe and deviltry with them.
They show up, and two weeks later this happens!
My guess is Ben Talbot went to their camp to have it off with a gypsy whore.
The bear gets hold of him, and they dump what's left of him in the ditch!
Got nothing to do with the gypsies.
Twenty-five years ago now, me Pa found him.
Quinn Noddy and all his flock.
Brains and guts and God-knows-what lying all over the moor for a quarter mile.
And, Quinn, the look on his face.
Like he'd been eaten alive.
Whatever did it was big, had claws, and didn't mind a load of buckshot.
After that, me Pa went home and melted down me Ma's wedding spoons and cast silver bullets on them.
Wouldn't leave the house on a full moon from then on.
He thought it was a werewolf.
I still say that bear's to blame.
You'd think the Talbots would've learned their lesson, eh?
Consorting with the Romas.
Right. Remember that black-eyed
Salome the old man married?
Went crazy up there in the ward, killed herself.
She was a gypo whore queen or some such, wasn't she?
LAWRENCE: Yes.
She was crazy for coming to this shithole you call a town.
What did he say?
You're in your drink, boy.
Get him out of my tavern, Nye!
Come on, lad.
If you want to do something about it,
I'll be outside.
My mother wasn't a whore.
Lawrence Talbot?
Good evening.
Please join us.
It's good to see you up and about.
Refreshed, recovered and as enchanting as ever.
Please, join us.
Good evening, Miss Conliffe.
Good evening.
What a pleasant surprise.
May I recommend the baked eel?
Singh has outdone himself this evening, haven't you, Singh?
Something plainer.
Thank you.
I was a moment ago telling my son that the telegraph system does reach us here in Ionely old Blackmoor.
Do you find your home much changed, Mr. Talbot?
Blackmoor does seem rather the same as I left it.
How so?
The villagers, they still have the same wild ideas.
Yes, well, they're a provincial lot,
I must say, ignorant and superstitious to a worldly man such as yourself.
We're savages at the ends of the earth.
I didn't intend to start a squabble.
All I'm saying is that you dismiss the natural man at your peril.
That's all.
I find your insecurities quite strange, Father.
No, you mistake that for my self-awareness.
And how comfortable are you in your skin, may I ask?
One can get used to anything.
Excuse me.
You know, Lawrence,
I've never understood what it is that you do, pretending to be other people.
But I understand you're highly celebrated and famous for it.
Perhaps one day I'll see for myself what all the fuss is about.
I think your mother would've liked that.
She loved you and your brother with all her heart.
Why did she do it?
She struggled with life, as we all do.
She lost.
Does that answer your question?
I saw Ben's body today.
What kind of animal could have done such a thing?
I've seen the work of a Kodiak bear and a Bengal tiger, nature at its most vicious, but I must say,
I've never seen anything like this.
People in town say it was a man.
You mean a raving lunatic at loose on the moor?
Yes, it's possible, but I think I would have run him down with my dogs.
On the other hand, the wounds are so terrible that only something human would seem capable of such wanton malevolence.
I found a strange medallion among Ben's belongings.
Yes, Saint Columbanus.
He was an Eastern saint.
He was also a gypsy.
So did Ben have dealings with the gypsies?
Yes, he was our negotiator.
The local gentry would pay a fee, and the gypsies would keep their criminal activities to a minimum.
And they would move on once they'd sold the local lads all the wine and dark-haired ladies they could stand.
"That orbèd maiden with white fire laden,
Whom mortals call the moon,
"Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor..."
"By the midnight breezes strewn."
She exerts enormous power, doesn't she?
I wish things were different.
Never look back, Lawrence.
Never look back.
The past is a wilderness of horrors.
Lawrence,
I'm glad you're home.
Can I help you, sir?
I was hoping to have a word with Miss Conliffe.
Just a moment, sir.
Miss Conliffe.
My behavior was unacceptable.
These were Ben's.
He'd want you to have them.
If there's anything you need, anything at all, please let me know.
I want to know what happened to him.
I'll do everything I can.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
Mother!
Mother!
YOUNG BEN: (WHISPERING)
Lawrence.
Lawrence.
Lawrence, wake up.
I heard something.
Lawrence.
Lawrence, I'm scared.
Go back to bed.
Mother?
Mother!
Hello.
Hello.
Ben said that you played here as children.
It was our refuge.
From what?
You mean from whom.
Your father, he has a way with being distant.
Ben told me it was because I reminded him of your mother.
He said you did, as well.
Which is why he put me in an asylum for a whole year, then shipped me off to my aunt in America.
SIR JOHN:
You sure you won't stay one more night?
My father has lodgings at the inn, and that's more convenient for the train, so...
When do you return to London?
Not till I find out what happened to my brother.
Lawrence, that's all well and good, but I think your inquiry could wait until tomorrow.
The moon is full tonight, and I'd prefer that you stay inside in the event that your raving lunatic theory is correct.
I don't want to lose you, too.
Take your horse, sir?
Good evening.
He says you must stay in the camp.
The woods are not safe.
Ask him if he knows anyone who sells these.
BOY: You want to talk to Maleva.
To who?
Maleva.
It was found on my brother's body.
Your caravan shows up, three men are killed.
I don't think it's a coincidence.
There is no coincidence.
Only fate.
But she plays a hidden hand.
Tell me about my brother.
MAN: Run round the back!
(MAN SHOUTING
INDISTINCTLY)
Give us the bloody bear, you old snake handler.
We know what's been going on.
Nonsense.
He dances, that's all.
Come on! Get off!
What's going on here?
We've come for the bear, Nye.
It done all the killing.
(SIGHS) For goodness' sake!
He's harmless.
What happened?
It's the Devil!
The Devil!
Mama! Mama!
Maria!
Maria! Where are you, Maria?
Maria!
MAN: Over there!
Maria!
Maria!
Mama!
Mama!
My baby.
Take the girl.
Stay in the camp.
LAWRENCE: Boy!
Boy!
Go back, get help!
Get Maleva!
WOMAN: Once he is bitten by the beast, there is no cure.
You should let him die.
You would make me a sinner.
There is no sin in killing a beast.
Is there not?
Sometimes the way of fate is a cruel one.
He can only be released by someone who loves him.
Whoa!
Lawrence.
Holy Mother of God.
Help me with him, Singh.
"Do thou but thine and be not diffident of wisdom
"She deserts thee not if thou dismiss not her"
Is everything all right?
Lawrence?
Get Dr. Lloyd.
Are you all right?
Yes, I feel better.
I thought you were leaving.
Well, this place is impossible to escape.
Besides, it's the least I could do.
What did the gypsies say?
Some nonsense about the
Devil being at Blackmoor.
It's remarkable.
A week ago, I would have said you'd never use that arm again.
And now?
It seems to have healed itself.
I'll be back to check on you at the end of the week.
Thank you, Doctor.
Miss Conliffe.
Yes?
I want to thank you.
For?
For prolonging your stay here at
Blackmoor with us during this difficult time.
Had there been some sense of filial obedience, well, you would not have been inconvenienced.
Well, Lawrence was trying to find out what happened to Ben.
And now we know it's still out there.
Nevertheless,
I thank you.
Not at all.
You should be asleep, Lawrence.
So should you.
Is there anything
I can get for you?
Are you expecting a war?
A Sikh is a warrior of God.
He must always arm himself against evil.
Do you believe in curses?
This house has seen more than its share of suffering.
Your mother. Your brother.
Yes, I believe in curses.
How could you stand it here all these years?
You didn't have to stay.
Silver.
I didn't know you hunted monsters.
Sometimes monsters hunt you.
Yes, he's been quite seriously injured, Inspector, and he's suffering from a loss of memory.
I don't think he could be of any use to you now.
Well, I think, at some point, he is going to want to talk about...
No.
I do understand.
Only if I could have just a few words with him.
No.
A completely unofficial interview.
Even the briefest exchange could be infinitely helpful to me.
Francis Aberline,
Scotland Yard.
Honored to meet you, Mr.
Talbot. I'm a huge admirer.
I'm sorry to hear of your troubles.
I do hope they won't impede your return to the stage.
Thank you.
Shall we?
Please.
LAWRENCE: It was an animal.
ABERLINE: You're quite sure?
What else could it have been?
There are other witnesses, no doubt, that had a better look than I did.
Well...
Not too good a look,
I'm afraid.
None of the locals survived to tell of it, and the gypsies only talk of demons and devils.
I understood your injury was quite savage.
Yes.
I hope you don't find this prurient, but would it be possible for me to arrange for a specialist to examine you?
It's amazing what we can discern by scientific means these days.
And at your convenience, of course.
Of course.
No, a great mystery, it is, given that there are no natural predators left in England capable of inflicting such horrific injuries.
Well, the savagery of the attack would suggest the action of an animal.
Or a lunatic, perhaps.
Someone with a history of mental disturbance, who'd spent time inside an asylum and who may have suffered injuries at the hands of his victims.
I get your implication and resent it.
You're clearly aware of my personal history, as I believe
I am aware of yours.
Weren't you in charge of the Ripper case a couple of years back?
Well, you're a direct man, so I'll be equally direct with you.
I'm not your enemy,
Mr. Talbot.
But you've been seen as Hamlet, Macbeth,
Richard III, all with that same face.
Now a prudent man would ask who else might be living inside that head of yours.
Good day, Inspector.
So you won't mind if I establish your whereabouts on the nights in question?
Feel free.
Good day, Mr. Talbot.
I'll be sending my specialists to examine you at your convenience, of course.
Lawrence?
Yeah.
You all right?
Yes.
What did the Inspector say?
Well, he asked a lot of questions.
I'm sorry.
I feel so responsible for what's happened to you.
If I hadn't sent that letter, you'd be back in New York.
No. No. It was right that I came back.
You mustn't feel like that.
No.
Try it.
Well, I can't make it skip like you.
You have to flick it.
May I?
Yes.
When you throw it, turn your wrist up and whip it.
Wrist up and whip it.
And make sure you swing your hips.
What's it like in New York?
Did you hear that?
What?
Horses.
Hello, Doctor.
I thought our appointment wasn't till Friday.
Come with us. It's nearly the full moon.
You were bitten by the beast.
You bear his mark now.
STRICKLAND: Mr. Talbot.
There are many of us here who are looking for a natural explanation.
Help us.
Come on, Talbot.
Show us your wound.
We are told it heals in an unnatural way.
Get your hands off of me.
Will you let him murder your wives and children?
MONTFORD: My eyes!
Damn you, Talbot!
Sorry, Colonel.
I meant to shoot you.
Sadly, I'm not the marksman I used to be.
I must be getting old.
He's cursed. God has forsaken him.
Let us deal with him.
You know you're trespassing on my land, and I could shoot you on the spot right now.
My Sikh manservant, he's on the roof, and he happens to be a crack shot with a repeating rifle.
And he will kill you.
He'll kill the next eight of you before he has to reload, so please take yourself off my land.
And if I see any of you trespassing this way again,
I won't be so civil, if you take my meaning.
Good day to you,
Colonel.
Lawrence.
You're bleeding.
How could they possibly think he's a threat to them?
Well, he's a stranger here in Blackmoor,
Miss Conliffe, and that makes him very dangerous.
Thank you.
Yes. You can also thank Singh when he returns from the village.
You're not the only one in the family who can act.
Samson!
Let's get something to clean that.
Did they hurt your shoulder?
No.
On the contrary, it feels much stronger than before.
That's good.
I was able to hold them...
All three of them back.
You know, you mustn't listen to them.
The villagers.
They're backward and foolish.
Everything I hate about this place.
This might sting a bit.
Lawrence.
Excuse me.
What's happened?
You have to leave.
Please pack your things.
Did I do something?
It's not safe here.
You must return to London tonight.
I'll be out here waiting.
Lawrence, wait.
What are you afraid of?
If anything ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.
REVEREND FISK:
There are those who doubtthe power of Satan.
The power of Satan
to change men into beasts!
But the ancient pagans did not doubt.
Nor did the prophets.
Did not Daniel warn Nebuchadnezzar?
But the proud king
did not heed Daniel.
And so, as the Bible says, "He was made as unto a wolf and cast out from men."
A beast has come among us.
But God will defend his faithful.
With his right hand,
he will smite the foul demon.
I say to you,
the enemy's ploy is a devious one.
Twisting the accursed into beasts,
he seeks to bring us low.
Make us as animals.
Teach us self-loathing,
so we forget that we are made in
the image of Almighty God himself!
Samson.
Why does our Lord
tolerate this mockery?
"Pride goeth
before destruction,
"a haughty spirit
before the fall."
I say it is because
we have sinned against him.
Because our crimes reek to heaven, and they demand vengeance.
Pint of bitter, please.
Mrs. Kirk.
Why aren't you out with MacQueen, trying to catch that thing what killed my husband?
As I don't know where the lunatic will strike, it seems the practical thing to do is to stay as near as possible to the potential victims.
And seeing that 214 of the 309 residents of Blackmoor and its environs live within, what,
500 yards of this tavern,
I was planning to spend the evening here.
Not Talbot Hall?
Why would you say that?
They're cursed, all of them.
Unfortunately, "cursed" does not give me a warrant to wander about Sir John's estate at night.
Rules, Mrs. Kirk.
They're all that keep us from a dog-eat-dog world, you know.
Pint of bitter, please.
Lawrence,
Miss Conliffe has left Blackmoor.
Yes, I sent her away.
She's probably in London by now.
Why would you do that, Lawrence?
Because this place is cursed.
Father.
It is a shrine to your beloved mother.
She was truly a beautiful woman.
I know that losing her wounded you deeply.
And it is monstrous, a young boy seeing his mother like that.
And I would have given my life, Lawrence, that you hadn't found us that night.
You must believe me when
I tell you this, Lawrence.
You do believe me, don't you?
I loved your mother with a passion like the burning of the sun.
Her death finished me.
I was devastated.
I still prowl the house at night, searching for her.
I'm dead all the same.
Look into my eyes, Lawrence.
You see,
I'm quite dead.
My dear fellow,
I wish I could tell you that the tragedy that has beset your life was over.
But I'm afraid the darkest hours of hell lie before you.
I don't think they'll kill you, Lawrence, but they will blame you.
The beast will have its day.
The beast will out.
We've got him, men!
We got him!
Mind the pit, Johnny!
Johnny?
Help me get out!
Shoot it! Shoot him!
Johnny!
Johnny?
MONTFORD: MacQueen!
Mom?
Hey, sweetie.
What are you doing up? Come here.
I don't like my room.
No?
That's okay. You know, you're still getting used to it.
I can't sleep either.
What are you looking at?
Some old photos. You want to see?
- Do you know who that is?
- No.
- It's me.
- It doesn't look like you.
I know. But that's me. That's your mom.
I was a kid once, too, believe it or not.
You're old now.
- How old do you think I am?
- Really old.
Have a guess.
Probably at least 21.
I wish you were right.
Show me a picture of when Dad was a little kid.
You know, I wish I could.
But I don't think we have any.
He's really hopeless at keeping photos.
Show me a picture of when I was a little kid.
You are a little kid. You're wonderful.
You certainly didn't cry as much as your little sister.
But she's up, so let's go.
Get some breakfast.
- Billing department.
- Let me play.
- No.
- I want to play!
- I'm eating breakfast!
- Billing department. Careful.
I need a bowl, Mom
I don't want to play soon.
I want to play now.
No, no, no, no.
Here, here.
- It's too small.
- Well, just make it work.
Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent.
Oh, man, what?
Every time I think I've pulled you out, you grow back in.
God.
- Good morning, guys.
- Speak to an agent!
I'm an agent.
Yeah, hello, I would really like to keep the old number if that's possible.
- Dude, don't eat on the floor, Foster.
- But I'm pouring my cereal.
Can I have it by the end of the day, please, because I...
Yes. Okay. Thank you.
Foster, can you please get up off the floor?
Cap's loose.
What is this? Is that wax?
We have no actual fruit?
We have wax fruit?
God damn it.
And, honey, if you wanna look at my books, please don't leave them all over the floor.
I didn't touch your books.
- Bye.
- See you, Dad.
See you, buddy.
You're not gonna take the boys to school?
I can't today. Bye.
- Are you gonna pick them up?
- I can't. I got a PTA meeting.
- I totally forgot.
- Why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.
I'll see you guys. Bye.
Yeah, I'm looking west
Always been looking that way
I'm gonna get it all happening
Just can't do it today
Yeah, I'm looking west
Always been looking that way
I'm gonna be somebody
I just can't be her today
- Hello?
- Daddy!
Hey, buddy, slow down...
- This is awesome!
- Share it with your brother.
- Okay.
- Share with your brother.
- Come watch TV with me.
- All right.
Look at this, babe. Nice job!
- Yes, it's getting there.
- Getting there?
- It looks awesome.
- Thanks.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Have you seen my box of sheet music anywhere?
I don't know, babe.
I know we packed them.
I packed them. I know.
I just... I can't find them.
I think the movers might have put them in the dining room.
- Come here, baby girl, come here.
- It's not in the dining room.
I've unpacked every single box, and it's just vanished.
I can't find it.
We'll find them. We'll find them.
Dalton, honey? Where are you?
Stay here.
Foster, stay with your sister.
- Dalton?
- Dalton!
Dalton!
- Hey!
- What?
- Hey, hey. Hey.
- What happened?
Did you fall?
Did you fall off the ladder?
Honey, did you fail down?
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?
- What are you doing climbing the ladder?
- Honey...
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Are you okay?
- What hurts? What hurts?
- My leg.
All right. Can you move it?
Can you move your leg? Is that okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh, man. What happened to your head?
- Oh, gosh!
- Scraped it.
Okay.
Honey, you cannot come up here, okay?
Do not explore anymore.
It's very dangerous, okay?
It's off limits now.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.
- Can you stand on it? Be careful.
- I think so.
I got you. Come here.
What are you doing?
You scared us, buddy.
You were just doing a little exploring?
Yeah.
- So, no more exploring up there, okay?
- Okay.
Yeah, you may be a superhero, buddy, but you're not invincible.
- You gotta be careful, all right?
- Okay.
Yeah.
Good night, sweetie.
So were you putting boxes away upstairs?
Don't, Josh.
I just hate feeling helpless. Sorry.
I'll figure out a way to lock the door tomorrow.
Good. It's dangerous, you know.
Maybe we should just put him on a child leash.
I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow.
I'm sorry I was pissy when you got home from work today.
No, didn't notice.
I was trying to do some work today and then
Cali woke up after a half hour, and she wouldn't go back down, and I just didn't get anything done.
I just want things to be different in this house.
I just had such a bad day.
I'm scared nothing is gonna change.
It will, I promise you.
We've just got to give it time.
Thanks for letting me take some time to work on my music.
Come on, I want you to do it.
I think I have a couple of good songs.
I mean, not all of them, but I think...
You know, there's a few that
I can do something with.
I love all your songs.
- Shut up. You do not!
- I do. Stop it.
Which one's your favorite?
- You should write a song about me.
- They're all about you.
Like how cool I am.
- Like, "He's the coolest guy..."
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no. Quiet.
- "Big muscles!"
- "Really, really pretty!"
- You'll wake up the baby.
Foster, can you finish your eggs, please?
Hey, Cali.
- Can you go wake up Dalton, Josh?
- Yeah.
Hey, Mr. Sleepy-pants. Get up.
Hey, Sleepy-pants.
You'd better get out of that bed or your mother's gonna kill us both.
Dalton, come on, buddy.
You gotta get ready for school.
Hey. Hey.
Dalton.
Dalton?
Dalton. Dalton. Dalton. Dalton!
There is no brain damage that we've detected.
Technically, yes, he's in a coma.
He doesn't react to stimuli.
He has no sleep-wake cycle.
But there's no brain trauma or infection.
His scans are all normal.
To be honest,
I've never seen anything like it.
But he can't just not wake up. I mean...
There's got to be something.
I'm sorry.
Okay, so what do we do?
- Does he stay here? Do we...
- We'll conduct some further testing.
It's only been a couple of days.
It could take a little longer for...
Excuse me a minute. I have to step out.
I'll be back in just a moment.
Dr. Sercarz, how long will the tests take?
Okay, so what I've done here is I've inserted a nasogastric feeding tube.
To get the length of the tube that I'm gonna need,
I measure from the tip of the nose to the earlobe and down to the xiphoid process, which is here.
Then I usually mark that off with some tape.
And then you need to lubricate the end of the tube that I'm going to insert about 4 inches.
And then I just slide it in like that.
I have to make sure the end of the tube is curved and that his head is a little bent, a little bent back.
And then we usually hold it in place with some surgical tape.
And that's it.
If there are any problems or any bleeding, just call me, okay?
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing you can do.
I want if!
Give me it! Give me it! I want it!
I want it! Now!
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
What's this?
An award.
That's today's date.
Did you get this today?
Honey, why didn't you tell us?
I know it's hard right now, but things are going to get better,
I promise.
I'm gonna show this to your dad.
It's fantastic.
I'm scared, Mom.
- Scared of what?
- Dalton.
Can I change rooms?
Why would you want to change rooms?
I don't like when he walks around at night.
Something really weird happened to me today.
What?
I heard this noise coming from Cali's room.
It was on the baby monitor.
It was like voices.
And I ran up here and I had a look, but there was no one in there.
It was probably just interference.
Those things are always picking up somebody else's signal.
I don't know. It sounded so clear.
It was like this whispering.
It was... It scared the hell out of me.
I was at the piano, and I could hear it on the monitor, and I turned up the volume and...
Who the hell is that?
Hold on.
Stay here.
Who is it?
Jesus.
Hello?
Oh, my God! Josh! Josh! Josh!
Please. Someone's in Cali's room!
Someone's in Cali's room!
There's someone there! I saw somebody!
He was standing right there!
He was standing right there!
- There's nobody here.
- I saw someone!
Okay, take her, get Foster, go in Dalton's room.
- Foster!
- What's going on?
The alarm's gone off!
God damn it!
Thanks, guys.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, honey. It's me.
They just told me, I've got to... I'm gonna have to stay late tonight to...
I gotta grade some tests, and it's gonna be a while so...
You don't have to wait up, okay?
I'll be home as soon as I can.
I love you.
Did he respond to any of the new tests?
No. No, he didn't.
But we have to give it time.
I've seen coma patients with a much longer inactivity time suddenly start making noises.
He's not in a coma.
They don't know what to call it.
They don't know what to do with him, so they've just given up.
I feel like the universe is just trying to see how far
I'll bend before I break.
Well, the universe picked a fight with the wrong chick.
That's okay. I got it.
Thank you.
Okay.
Josh, where are you?
I need you to come home now, please.
L' ['S 10230.
You've been coming home late every single night.
In all the years you've worked at the school, you've never had to do that.
Why all of a sudden are you staying back late?
You know, I don't like it either.
I was grading tests. I mean...
What choice do I have?
- I've got to pay Dalton's bills.
- Josh.
I'm scared. I'm so scared and...
I'm scared. He's my son, too.
You don't understand.
I'm scared for Dalton.
I'm scared of this house.
There's something wrong with this place.
I'm not imagining it. I can feel it.
It's like a sickness.
Ever since we've moved in, everything's just gone wrong.
You think our house is haunted?
I don't think it. I know it.
Things move around in here by themselves.
I walk into the kitchen at night to get a drink, I can feel eyes on me.
I can't be in there alone anymore.
I need you. But you're never here.
- Where are you?
- I told you. I was grading tests.
That's not what I mean. You're not here with me in this situation.
You're just avoiding it, like everything stressful, whether it's this or parking tickets.
Oh, God. Stop saying that, okay?
I don't avoid stressful situations.
I'm just dealing with it in my own fucking way.
Fine. Deal with this!
Jesus.
Oh, God.
Josh?
Josh.
Renai?
Renai!
- What, what, what? What is it?
- There's someone here.
There's someone in the room!
He was right there, I swear!
Don't you dare not believe me.
Please. Please, believe me.
I swear he was right there.
I do, I do. I do believe you.
I just don't know what you want me to do.
I want to leave. Please.
I want to leave this house.
I can't spend another night here. Please!
- Please, help me!
- Okay, okay, okay.
We're going.
Lorraine, please, you shouldn't be doing any of this. Just sit down.
I'm perfectly capable of putting a few things away.
I did it for Josh his Whole life.
I know, but I feel terrible.
I think it's you who should be sitting down by the looks of it.
I can't believe you got Josh to hold still for a photo.
What I can't believe is that we are doing this all over again.
Ridiculous.
You must think I'm crazy.
Nobody, not me or anybody, knows what you're going through right now.
Whatever you have to do to get through it, do it.
And you don't have to apologize for anything.
Thanks.
Dalton?
Your faith can help. Trust it, you know.
- Hello.
- Josh.
This is the first line of a joke, right?
A guy comes home to find his wife with a priest.
- This is Liam Martin.
- Nice to meet you.
He's actually a very old friend of mine.
- This is my husband, Josh.
- What's going on here?
- I should be going.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for the tea.
This thing from the other house has followed us here.
I saw something today.
I thought it was a little boy.
I followed it into Dalton's room.
But it wasn't a child.
It was something else.
So what? You just brought a priest in to get rid of it?
I didn't know what else to do, Josh.
Come on, Renal.
When's the last time you went to church?
What's happening to Renai is real.
I've seen it for myself.
I came today because last night
I had a dream about this place.
I was in this house, but it was late at night.
I was afraid.
I went into your bedroom, but you were both asleep.
I knew I was asleep in the dream, but I could feel that someone was awake in the house.
I went into Dalton's room.
There was something in there with him.
It was standing there in the corner.
I asked it, "Who are you?"
And it said it was a visitor.
I said, "What do you want?"
It said, "Dalton."
I can still hear that voice.
What? What?
- It's here!
- What?
Jesus!
Oh, my God!
Okay. He's okay.
Please! Please, help him! Please!
I know someone who can help if you're willing to ask.
I'm Specs. This is Tucker.
- I'm Renai. Hi.
- Hi.
- You must be Josh.
- Yeah. Hi.
That wasn't psychic.
Elise already told me your name so...
Where is Elise?
She sent us ahead to do some preliminary tests.
Helps weed out the nut jobs.
- What is that?
- It's a Trifield meter.
Measures DC fields and the natural electromagnetic environment.
Yeah, sometimes old wiring can leak into the atmosphere.
It causes hallucinations, changes in energy.
It's a little more important than that, but whatever.
The tech stuff's not really relevant to you guys anyway.
It's all very relevant, actually.
What?
Starfleet Series One.
It's hard to find.
Should have kept it in its box.
This device measures changes in UV light.
I make all this equipment myself, you know.
It's impressive.
Thanks.
It's not that hard if you know what you're doing.
Yeah, that one's basically a modified toy.
I'm gonna need some time alone to concentrate.
This field is...
Look, the body is made up of energy.
- Where does that energy go when we die?
- We can call Elise.
Now.
I wasn't sure the doorbell was working.
I'm sorry.
- That's fine. Come on in.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Rainier?
No, Mrs. Rainier is my mother.
Just call me Elise.
- I'm Josh.
- I knew that.
You've grown since I last saw you.
Since you last saw me?
Your mother and I have been friends a long time.
- Well, hello.
- This is my wife, Renai.
- How do you do?
- Hi, thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.
- Can we get you anything, Elise?
No, I'm fine, thank you so much.
We took Trifield and EMF readings of the whole house, all the wiring, alarm clocks, radios, toasters,
TV, record player, fuse box, nothing went off the charts except for the...
And the previous home?
Tucker hadn't monitored that yet.
You know what? Don't even sweat it.
I'll make myself available.
I'll get on that this afternoon.
Yeah, but I'll have to come, too, because who's going to operate the equipment?
Well, strictly, I could do it without...
- Yeah, but I need to oversee...
- Yeah, but it's not...
That's fine, gentlemen.
I don't think bad wiring is the problem here.
May I walk through the house?
- Sure, of course.
- Thank you.
Your other children are with Lorraine, right?
Yeah, they are.
Steven, do you have your sketchbook?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Good. 'Cause we're gonna need it.
What do you need that for?
She tells me what she sees, and I draw it.
It's the most important part of her process.
- That's debatable.
- It's not debatable.
It is, but whatever.
Leave the light off.
Hey, Dalton.
You are a very handsome boy.
Your mom and dad are here, so don't you worry.
What? What...
The face...
What?
Blood red face.
Black... Black arms. Black legs.
Black body.
Slow down.
- His feet are black. His legs are black.
- Slow down.
What is it?
Oh, my God.
And pitch black eyes.
They're like two dark holes.
He has hooves for feet.
- What?
- And long spidery fingernails.
Elise, what's......
Hey, what is that?
I'm not sure if you're ready to hear this yet, but unfortunately, I can't waste any time easing you into it.
I want you to know, this is what I believe, and it may contradict a previous medical diagnosis, but...
You called me here, and I'm taking that as an acceptance of my readings. Yes?
Yes, go on.
Your son isn't in a coma.
Falling off a ladder had nothing to do with this.
His physical body's here.
But his spiritual body is not.
And the reason these disturbances, they followed you to a new home, is because it's not the house that's haunted.
It's your son.
I don't understand.
Have you ever heard of astral projection?
Yes. It's out of body experience or something?
I like to call them travelers.
You see, these are people with the ability to leave their physical body and to travel to different places in astral form.
Now, Dalton, he is a very accomplished astral projector.
He's been doing it in his sleep for a long time.
He has been since he was very young.
And he's unafraid because he thinks they're dreams.
And it's that very lack of fear that has led him to travel too far.
And to become lost.
Lost?
Lost where?
In a place that I call the Further.
What? What does that mean?
The Further is a world far beyond our own, yet it's all around us, a place without time as we know it.
It's a dark realm filled with the tortured souls of the dead, a place not meant for the living.
That's where Dalton is.
And the problem is that with his astral body gone, he's just left us with a physical body, an empty vessel.
And there are entities that know this because they can smell it.
That's why they're gathered around him.
Are these the things that
I've been seeing?
They're all trying to get inside of his physical body simply because they...
They crave life, the chance to live again.
But there are other entities who are malevolent and have a more insidious agenda.
And then, there's this.
A demon who seeks Dalton's body for one reason: to cause pain to others.
He is so desperate to possess Dalton, and he's the closest of all the entities to getting inside of him.
What do you mean the closest?
Because these entities, they can't just walk into the bodies of the living anytime they please.
To cross over from their realm, it takes time. It takes energy.
But the longer that Dalton's astral body is kept away from his physical body, the weaker the link gets.
The easier it is to possess him.
Is there anything we can do to bring Dalton back?
There's something we could try.
It's a little unorthodox.
But I would need your complete trust.
No, no, no.
I'm sorry, this has gone too far.
What? No, please, Josh.
You said you would give her a chance.
I have given her a chance, honey, but I can't have somebody coming into our home and telling us the reason our son is in a coma is because his soul has floated off somewhere in another dimension.
We're gonna bring her all the way here and not even consider what she's saying?
I did this to make sure you could feel at ease. And if it helped, great.
I've listened to the dog and pony show.
I have seen the drawings.
But to bring Dalton into it, no.
But why is our son still in a coma?
Why can't the doctors tell us what is wrong with him?
How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here?
Don't you see, Renai?
You want to believe. Anybody would.
You don't believe me!
You don't believe me!
I moved houses for you.
What do you mean, I don't believe you?
I'm on your side here.
But this, this is dangerous and exploitative.
You guys come into the home of a seriously ill child, and you make some tenuous connection between him and the images my wife is seeing, and voila!
Tears validate your power, and thank you very much, that will be $600 please.
- Thank you for coming.
- Please. Please.
- Thank you. No, I really understand.
- Please.
Thank you for your hospitality.
Good luck.
Oh, Jesus!
Sorry to waste your time.
Where are you, buddy?
Did you go somewhere?
No.
No, you're right here.
You are right here.
Can you hear me?
I know you can hear me, but you gotta show me, okay, buddy?
You gotta show me that you can hear me.
Okay.
What's most important is that you realize no two attempts are the same.
I'm going to be completely honest with you about the results.
If there's no dialogue established,
I'm gonna tell you.
These still cameras are rigged to pick up any changes in the atmosphere, both electrical or temperature-wise.
Don't be alarmed if they go off
You're gonna see a lot of confusing things, things you don't understand.
But do not question them and do not speak in any way.
I want you to know whatever I say when I'm in tune is going to be at a very low volume.
You won't hear any of it.
But Steven's gonna write it down.
He's going repeat it for you. Okay?
Dim the lights, please.
We are calling out to you, Dalton.
Tell us you're safe.
Tell us where you are.
Tell us you're safe.
Tell us where you are.
Dalton.
Can you hear us? Answer us.
Who's there?
Dalton, it's your mother and father.
We've been searching for you.
Where are you?
I can't see in here.
Dalton... Dalton, you don't need to see.
Follow my voice.
Follow my voice, Dalton.
Dalton. Why aren't you...
Why aren't you talking anymore?
Dalton?
If they hear me, they'll hurt me.
Who will hurt you?
Who will hurt you, Dalton?
The man with fire on his face.
Dalton.
Dalton, can you find your way out?
There is no way out.
Follow my voice, Dalton.
Follow my voice.
Be quiet.
They'll hear you.
They won't hear me, Dalton.
Follow my voice.
Follow my voice.
They heard you.
Oh, my God.
Mommy and Daddy.
Help. Help.
Help me, help me, help.
Dalton?
You bitch.
Dalton?
Specs!
Leave this vessel!
- He's alive. He's alive, oh, God.
- He's alive? Jesus.
Leave this vessel!
Leave this vessel! Leave this vessel!
Leave his body!
Tucker, turn on the light!
Leave this body now!
Come here, Dalton.
Son. Come here.
- He's alive. He's alive, oh, God.
- He's alive? Jesus.
- Honey.
- Oh, God.
Three cameras. Around the clock.
We got nothing.
But I did find this on the video.
Take a look.
Take a look.
You see that?
I went through it.
Frame by frame
By frame.
Oh, my God.
- Who's that?
- I'll get it.
Hi, Lorraine.
Mom, what are you doing here?
I asked your mother to come over.
I called her immediately after the session.
- Why?
- There's something we must talk about.
Lorraine, have a seat.
Go on. Tell him.
Tell me what, Mom?
The reason
I knew to call Elise in this situation, the reason I know her so well, is because I called her myself once, years ago, to help you.
What are you talking about, Mom?
It's no accident that your son is a gifted traveler.
The ability was handed down to him.
By his father.
Me?
No, I don't do... I can't do that.
When you were about eight, you suffered night terrors,
These awful fits of pure fear.
You were terrified of an old woman you said used to come visit you at night.
I dismissed your stories. I...
I told you to grow up.
And then I saw her for myself.
At first,
I thought it was a camera problem.
And then I saw her again.
In each photo, she got closer and closer and closer to you.
Finally, I was so frightened,
I found Elise.
Do you remember any of this, honey, do you?
No. I don't.
Suppressing your memory and your ability to astral project was the only way to stop her from getting into you.
But in the back of your mind, you're still afraid to have your picture taken, aren't you?
I kept those photos hidden from you ever since.
I advised Lorraine to hide them, to stop taking your picture, to just let you forget.
- Who is she?
- A parasite.
She befriended your astral body and then drew you out into the Further, just as Dalton has been drawn out.
I'm so sorry, Josh.
I didn't want to make you remember all this.
I do it for the sake of your son.
Your son is out there.
And you are the only one that can bring him back.
And with what we saw tonight,
I would say he doesn't have much time left to wait for you.
Okay.
You've always been stronger than me.
You can do this.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Please come back.
Remember why you're traveling and keep one foot in this world.
Do not draw attention to yourself.
If they realize you are not one of them, they will come for your physical body in this world.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
I don't know what I'm ready for, but... Okay.
Close your eyes, Josh, take a deep breath, and relax.
With each breath, let the life around you fade into the background.
Just listen to the ticking of the metronome.
Focus on the spot in the center of your forehead.
The universe is deathless.
It is deathless because having no finite self, it stays infinite.
A sound man, by not advancing himself, stays the further ahead of himself.
It's useless.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Now you're outside.
Let my voice be your guide.
Keep a steady stride.
Into the Further you go.
Dalton.
He's in.
Dalton!
Hello?
Hello?
Wait!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I'm looking for my son Dalton.
Dalton!
Dalton!
Where's my son?
Tell me where my son is.
Please.
What's happening to him?
Jesus.
Help him, Elise! Please!
You're stronger than they are, Josh.
You can beat them. You are stronger.
You are the one alive.
Get away from me!
- Dalton!
- Daddy?
- Oh, God! Buddy!
- Daddy!
- Oh, my God! Oh, buddy.
- Daddy.
- Oh, my God.
- Daddy.
Oh, buddy, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Oh, God.
- Daddy, look. I'm chained.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
Face me, buddy. Face me. Come here.
We'll get you out.
We'll get you out, buddy, okay?
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.
What? What?
Oh, Gad. Okay.
It's okay. Listen to me. Look at me.
None of this is real, okay?
This is not real.
Look at me. Look at my eyes, buddy.
None of this is real.
We're going to go home, okay?
You gotta help me.
There's one.
Oh, my God, Dad. He's looking.
Come on, baby. Stay here, baby.
Come on, stay with us.
Daddy!
He's made contact.
Grab the light!
He found your son.
I know it.
Well, then wake them up, for God sake!
I can't. He needs to find us.
I'm scared, Dad.
No! Stop!
Please, Elise, do something!
Renai, you must call out to him.
Josh. Josh. Follow my voice!
Follow my voice, honey.
Get away! Get away!
Come back to us!
Follow my voice, Josh.
Daddy! Listen, I think it's Mommy!
Josh, come back to me. Follow my voice.
Josh, follow my voice.
Follow my voice, Josh.
Follow my voice.
There's something in there! In there!
Elise!
Steven, Lorraine, go check on Dalton.
- What?
- Go check on Dalton.
- What?
- Go check on Dalton now!
They're crossing over into our world.
- Elise!
- Tucker!
No, you have to shine the light on Josh.
Come on!
Let's go around back.
Shine the light on Josh! On Josh!
Tucker, on Josh!
- You've got to call him back!
- Josh!
Josh! Josh!
Come back to us, Josh, please!
Josh! Josh! Come back, please!
Come on, Dad!
Come on, he's right behind us!
- We have to go!
- I'm right behind you! Go!
You.
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'm not scared of you.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
You can get away from me.
Get the hell away from me!
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!
Please, please, please!
Come back to us! Follow my voice!
Follow my voice! Please, honey!
Josh, come back! Come back to us!
Get the hell away from me!
Please, Josh, please, come back to us, please!
Follow my voice!
Follow my voice! Please!
Josh, please! Come back, please!
Leave me alone!
I've got Dalton. He's awake!
Oh, my boy!
He's okay! He's okay!
We did it, buddy.
You're back. You're back.
Dude, I got some amazing shots.
You're gonna write a book, and my photos are gonna be the main selling point.
Not the main selling point, but they'll definitely be important.
They will be important.
A picture's worth a thousand words.
Yeah, but words are worth a thousand words, too.
You're really hungry, aren't you?
And I'm tired, too.
You're tired?
- No, you can't be tired.
- Yes, I can.
No, you've been asleep for far too long.
And you know what?
I'm never letting you go to sleep again.
You showed me a new world.
No, I didn't.
You've been there before, remember?
Well, let's hope I forget again.
Guess I don't need these anymore.
What?
Nothing.
I'm gonna get rid of these.
All right.
Why did you do that?
Why would you do that to me when you know how I feel about that?
Why? Why?
Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why?
No, you're not tired.
In fact, you're never going to sleep again. You have to stay awake
- for the rest of your life, with me.
- No.
Why? Why? Why?
You bitch!
- Can you watch him, Lorraine?
- Sure.
Elise.
Josh! Josh!
Josh, where are you?
Josh!
Honey, please... Josh!
Josh?
Oh, Jesus.
Renai,
I'm right here.
"Do you ever have emotions that you can't explain?
"Have you ever lost control of these emotions?
"Do these emotions have a name?"
These were the first three questions that Dr Malicent asked of Joseph Kinkirk just six hours after his arrest, to which Kinkirk answered,
"Yes, yes, and Henry."
This course of exchange laid the foundation for a defence that failed not only because of the meticulously collected physical evidence, um, but also because of the currently accepted opinion in modern psychology - multiple personality syndrome does not exist.
It was a psychological fad, a therapist-induced disorder perpetuated by an unending barrage of TV talk shows and novels and ill-conceived Hollywood movies.
Joseph Kinkirk has been under observation at various psychiatric institutions for most of his adult life and yet there has not been one documented reference to Henry until after his arrest.
Henry did not abduct Sarah McKenzie.
He didn't strip her naked or tie her to a bed in the cellar.
He didn't rape her 12-year-old body or attempt to remove her ovaries with a box cutter.
And he didn't videotape the two hours it took Sarah to bleed to death when that operation failed.
Henry did not commit these atrocities because...
...Henry does not exist.
Joseph Kinkirk is fully aware of his actions...
...just as he was when he committed them.
It's after midnight, I'm afraid.
I know.
I need two shots of tequila, a waterback and some volume on the TV.
Please.
Certainly.
At one minute past midnight.
The State of Missouri began the execution
of Joseph Kinkirk by lethal injection.
With no reprieve coming
from the Governor's office...
Oh, God.
Can I have two... two more shots, please?
Would you like me to change the channel?
No, that's fine.
...and Mr Kinkirk was pronounced dead
at 18 minutes past the hour.
As you've just heard.
Joseph Kinkirk has been put to death
in a Missouri state prison.
We will have further reaction
to this execution...
- Hello.
- Hi, Mommy!
Hi, sweetie.
I miss you.
I miss you too.
What's that noise?
Uncle Stephen's making breakfast.
OK, now can we go to Starbucks?
How was last night?
We watched 'Night of the Living Dead'.
Oh, no - secrets! Shh.
Put your uncle on the phone.
Mommy wants to talk to you.
So did you see them fry the bad guy last night?
It was lethal injection. And no.
You get shit-faced as usual?
Watch your language in front of Sammy.
Sorry. Did you, as usual, get shit-faced?
I'm running late.
I'll see you this afternoon, OK?
Hello?
Hey. Hey! That's rude.
Your mother hung up on me.
Dad, can I call you back?
I'm just at the airport...
I need your opinion on a patient!
You 're shouting again.
Am I?
Sorry!
Look, I think you 'll find this one to be very interesting.
Just send me the file and I'll look it over.
No, no, you have to meet him.
I'll pick you up at the airport.
Just give him one hour.
You can't expect me to rearrange my life every time you dig up some medical oddity.
Did you hang up?
Dad?
Hi.
So where'd you find this David Bernburg?
He was referred to me by Dr Foster.
Charlie?
Mm-hm.
Well, that figures.
David was picked up for vagrancy and then released into Charlie's care the next day.
Well, how long has he been a patient here?
Couple of days. Since the weekend.
That's all?
Mm-hm.
You usually like to treat them for a month before you let me pick them apart.
Ah, but this one has a whole new kind of act.
Oh, yeah?
Enjoy.
Can we get a little heat going in here?
Sure.
Hi.
Hi.
Thank you.
Sure.
I'm Dr Cara Jessup.
And you must be David.
David Bernburg. Is that right?
Yes.
'Bernburg' - is that German?
I don't know.
Do you know why we're here?
You want to ask me some questions.
Is that alright with you?
Yes.
OK. Have you been in a wheelchair your entire life?
No.
I had an accident a few years back.
OK.
Are you left- or right-handed?
Right.
And, um, in your childhood home, how many windows are there?
11 if you count the star window in the door.
But it didn't open.
OK, so when you 're counting these windows, are you inside or outside the house?
Inside. It's warmer.
Mm-hm.
Were you raised in any religion?
Ma'am, I was raised in the mountains.
God held our hand and the devil waited for us to fall.
I'd like to show you a series of abstract images and I'd like you to just describe any thought that comes to mind, OK?
Two small children.
Mm-hm.
And they're playing that game, um...
Patty cake, patty cake...
OK, OK. Good.
And this one?
It looks like an elephant in the circus.
Is it a big elephant?
No, a baby elephant.
Do you see any numbers in the circle?
OK.
How about this one?
Sure.
Do you ever have any emotions you can't explain?
No.
Do you ever feel angry or violent or depressed for no apparent reason?
No.
OK. Thank you very much.
Alright, Dad, I'm waiting.
For what?
Well, you didn't bring me here to meet David, did you?
Mind if I make a call?
No, I got nothing but time.
Go right ahead.
Hello.
This is Dr Harding. Is Adam there?
I'm sorry, Dr Harding.
I'm the only one here.
I'd like you to look for him.
What was that?
This is Adam.
Adam, it's Dr Harding.
I wonder if you would have a moment to speak with a colleague of mine?
Sure.
You didn't need to do that.
Do what?
Show off. It makes you look like a charlatan.
Hello.
I'm Dr Jessup.
Jessup? You 're Dr Harding's daughter?
Yes, I am. And you 're Adam.
Your husband was murdered, right?
Ooh.
Yes.
How?
His throat was slit by a mugger.
When?
Three years ago.
Where?
When we were walking home from church on Christmas Eve.
You think that was rude of me?
Not at all.
I'm used to it.
Aggressive role manipulation is a common avoidance technique used by borderline personalities during therapy.
But you knew that, didn't you?
Attagirl.
I have to watch out for your exploitative pathological tendencies.
Ready to answer some questions?
Shoot.
In your childhood home, how many windows are there?
One.
One?
Mm-hm.
Actually, two if you count the windshield.
I see.
Were you raised in any religion?
Catholic.
Mm-hm.
OK, Adam, I have a series of abstract images here.
I'd like you to take a look at them...
Dancers, moth, elephants, the Devil.
I've seen all this stuff before, Doctor.
Yes, you have. Clearly.
OK, Adam.
Do you see any numbers in the circles?
Nope.
And this one?
No.
Great. Great.
What about this one?
The number seven.
OK.
OK, Adam, um... may I look at your eyes?
Are you wearing contact lenses?
No. This is their natural colour.
Are you colourblind?
Red deficient, since birth.
OK, Adam, I think we're done here.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Can I go now?
You set me up.
No, no. I offered you a chance to reconsider some of your assumptions.
Adam is the host. David is the alter.
Why didn't you let me interview Adam first?
Where's the fun in that?
Hello!
Mommy!
Hello!
Hello!
I missed you so much!
Yay!
Hey, Pop.
Hey, Stevo. This is quite a rig.
Mm-hm.
Hah.
Hey, Grandpa.
There's my angel. How you doing?
Go get your stuff, OK?
OK.
I'll help you.
She have fun?
Uh, she was pretty cranky till that second beer set in.
You staying for dinner?
No.
Sammy's got school in the morning.
Mm-hm.
You OK? I mean, really OK?
Yeah, I'll be OK.
What are you working on?
Oh, I'm just offlining an industrial.
Oh, great.
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
No.
No.
OK, here we are.
Did you say thank you to Uncle Stephen, honey?
Thank you, Uncle Stephen.
Sammy, next time you bring the beers, OK?
OK.
I gotta tell you, I'm loving these underage drinking jokes.
Thank you.
Just loving them.
Thank you very much.
Mm-hm. 'Bye!
Goodbye. Get off my property.
- 'Bye.
Don't pull all the way up into the driveway.
Why?
It'll be too tight for me to get out.
You 'll be able to get out.
No, it's...
Yep.
Thanks, Pop. This is perfect.
Hey, honey, get in the bathtub, OK?
And then we'll have dinner.
OK, Mom!
What's that?
Adam's file. Take a look.
I'll think about it.
I don't seem to have much time for God nowadays, Doctor.
It seems to work both ways.
Hows about you? Got your faith?
My daughter lost her husband not too long ago.
He was a good, good man and he was murdered for no reason at all.
Murdered?
Mm-hm.
So I find it kind of hard to believe in a God that could hurt my daughter...
...is Adam there?
I'm sorry,
Dr Harding. I'm the only one here.
Little CC.
Hey, Charlie. You look terrible.
Well, thank you.
A course of antibiotics, I'll be fine.
Alright.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Um, Adam Saber.
I want to know how he came to you and why you dumped him on my father.
The police found him laying in the street.
He didn't appear intoxicated.
Claimed he wasn't able to walk.
Gave his name as David Bernburg.
By the time I examined him, he was up on his feet, calling himself Adam Saber, said he had no idea how he got to the hospital.
Well, I thought of your father immediately.
Well, yeah, sure.
Um, have you ever had a patient who was colourblind in just one eye?
No. Why?
I was just thinking it might explain...
Never mind.
How's Sammy?
She's great.
Soccer-crazy.
There are tryouts at the school this Friday. You should come.
I'd like that.
Good.
Um, can I get a copy of his hospital file?
I'll fax it this afternoon.
Thank you.
Take care of yourself, alright?
Yeah.
I will. You take care of that kid.
Yeah. Always.
Um, does Ellie still work in radiology?
Yeah, but she's up on the third floor now.
Alright. Thanks again.
'Bye.
Is it possible that when he wrenches his neck, he's compressing, decompressing a nerve and causing some kind of temporary paralysis?
Look.
This X-ray - the third, the fourth, the fifth vertebrae...
Fused.
Mmm.
So we're looking at X-rays here of two different people.
Two different people.
It's a hoax - a guy, the doctor.
The doctor?
Sure.
How well do you know him?
Well, some days, not at all.
Gets under your skin, doesn't he?
These aren't his films. They can't be.
Isn't it possible that what you 're looking at is actually what you 're seeing?
No, because this is not possible.
Adam is the real deal.
No.
He is a desperately ill young man, but he's fully aware of David and all of David's actions.
David is pure invention and I'll prove it to you.
You know what? We haven't had dinner together in over a month.
Well, you 're coming to Easter, aren't you?
Uh-huh.
Do you want me to bring anything?
Just your delightful self.
That's my girl.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thank you.
OK, what name?
So, David Bernburg,
Shadywood High School, Shadywood.
Shadywood.
Sorry, Doctor. Scared you a little right there, huh?
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
Listen, uh, I didn't want you to leave without having a chance to say thank you.
For what?
For trying to help.
Thanks.
You 're welcome.
Excuse me. I'm looking for yearbooks.
Second aisle down to the back.
But you best be quick.
I'm locking up in 10 minutes.
No, I'll be quick. I promise.
OK.
Are you almost done?
Um, I'll be done in a minute.
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Bless the bed that I lay on
Bless me as they lay me down to sleep
I give myself to God to keep
Five little angels round my bed
One to the foot and one to the head
One to sing and one to pray
And one to take my sins away.
Amen.
She doesn't mean it.
Right?
Hello.
Charlie?
Oh, little CC.
You sound terrible.
Listen, listen. Can I bring you anything?
Uh, no. I've got soup.
And, um, that antibiotic's about to kick in.
I hate to ask, but you never faxed me Adam Saber's file.
Oh, I'm sorry. Is first thing alright?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Just get some rest, OK?
I will.
See you soon.
OK. Feel better.
Excuse me.
Do you know the way to the Quarry House?
I don't know how I got to the hospital.
I have no idea how I got to bed last night.
You know, I just wake up in my room and I don't remember nothing.
The nurses helped you into your bed.
Was I awake?
In a matter of speaking.
Hello?
They're ruined, aren't they?
I... I'm sorry. I knocked at the front door.
I was...
I found them this morning.
They must have been in water for weeks.
All that music, all that life, all gone.
I think... I think some of it can be saved, actually.
Well, there's always hope.
Now, who are you?
I'm looking for David Bernburg.
David?
Yeah.
You 're standing on him, aren't you?
Well, it happens around this time of year - some local reporter inevitably stumbles onto a story in the archives and tries to resurrect it as a cautionary tale.
Are you talking about David's accident?
No, my dear.
His murder.
How did his accident happen?
He fell.
Wet leaves on stone steps.
And just like that his life had to begin again.
But he accepted his fate with such nobility.
For three years,
David showed the world how brightly the Holy Spirit shone within him.
But then... David lost his way.
He found a doctor in the city who was experimenting with spinal replacement or some such nonsense.
David came to believe that this practitioner would one day give him back his legs.
It seemed as if every month, he'd ride into the city on the bus with hope in his eyes...
...only to be injected and sliced open and return broken-hearted.
And then one month he left home and never returned.
It was one week later when they found his remains.
He'd... been taken into the woods and abused.
Tortured.
Can you imagine?
David sitting there, watching, unable to fight back, watching as they did those unspeakable things to him?
I... I cannot. I...
And I pray you never will.
David turned his back on God and looked to science for his answers.
The Lord told us quite plainly.
"Wane not, thy faith in me."
Hey, Art. I'll have a cup of coffee and some of that apple pie, huh?
Hi, honey bun.
Did you have a good time, hmm?
No. We had a bird funeral.
Great. Great.
Mmm, yeah.
Well, do you want to pick out a treat while I talk to Grandpa?
OK, go ahead.
What's the fundamental difference between a disassociated personality and a delusional one?
No hello?
'Cause I have something.
Yeah?
OK, so the real David Bernburg was born on February 5, 1963.
He slipped and broke his back in November of 1979.
In April of 1982, he was murdered.
Now, while every local TV station and newspaper was recounting the details of his horrific death, your Adam Saber was six years old, his mother had just died and he'd been placed in the first of several foster homes.
His escape was this... this macabre murder.
Now, everything that Adam knew of David he would have gleaned from the media, right?
OK, well, say that I agree with these...
...somewhat shaky assumptions.
Why would Adam create a delusion?
Give me your wallet.
Any wallet will do?
Mm-hm.
Alright.
So why do you carry this picture of Mom?
To remind me of her.
Mm-hm, and experience the positive effects that these memories evoke.
Yeah.
Yes.
Now, if this picture existed but you had no awareness of it, would you still be able to benefit from its existence?
I suppose not, no.
Oh, OK.
So I believe, as a child,
Adam Saber began carrying around a mental picture of David so that no matter where he went, no matter how horrific things became, there was always someone who had it worse -
David Bernburg who was tortured to death by Satan-worshipping mountain witches.
But to benefit from this mental image, he must be fully aware of it and therefore cannot be disassociated.
That is a very compelling diagnosis.
Thank you very much.
How are you gonna prove it?
Oh, oh, Dad, I'm not gonna prove it.
I'm gonna cure it.
Hello, Mrs Bernburg.
Thank you again for agreeing to help me with this.
I wanted to tell you that, um, Adam has created an impersonation of your son.
I, um... I don't want you to be alarmed.
I've raised three boys and said prayers upon their graves.
Not much alarms me.
Thank you. I do appreciate it.
Here's... this is Adam now.
Hello, Adam.
Hey.
This is Dita Bernburg.
Is the name familiar to you at all?
Nope.
Er, her son David was murdered 25 years ago.
Shit.
I'm sorry.
You may have heard of it.
It was in the papers.
25 years ago? I was, like, 6 years old.
I didn't read the papers much.
Mm-hm.
You gonna get that?
No-one knows I'm here.
It's probably for you.
Yo, this is Adam.
I'd like to speak with David, please.
There's no David here.
Momma?
You found me, Momma.
My son is dead.
No, Momma. I'm not dead.
You are not my son.
Yes, I am.
We live at the Quarry House on Tull Road.
I was able to find your address in the phone book.
My bedroom used to be a library.
You used to fold the clothes on the shelves like books.
Stop it.
Yeah.
You used to say, "What clothes shall we read today, David?"
No.
My bed.
My bed was made from harvest wood to keep me safe from the spirits.
My son died 25 years ago.
You have a nail in your pocket.
How could you know that?
No-one knows that, only...
We found it in in Askern Mine.
You always carry it, Momma.
David.
Momma.
Iron from the earth...
...to ward off evil.
To ward off evil.
Yes.
Then it's not working.
I know there's a rational explanation for this. Just wait for me.
Momma!
Yeah, this is it.
You can get him out of the van.
You want me to come with you?
No, we'll be fine.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Alright.
I'll be fine.
Alright, David, do you know where you are?
No, ma'am.
Well, there's no reason that you should recognise this place.
What is it?
What's the matter.
I was here at night.
What?
That's why I didn't recognise this place.
Things are different.
It was snowing.
Right there, there was a shed.
David?
He's coming.
Who's coming?
Who's coming?
Shhh.
Just tell me.
It's alright. It's alright.
Tell me. Tell me, who is it?
Who is it? Who's coming?
The Devil.
I'm sorry. Alright, I'm sorry.
Please don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.
I'm gonna take you back to the van.
OK? I'm taking you...
Alright. Here we go, OK.
It's alright.
Please, please, please get me out of here.
Listen, the chair is stuck.
I have to go back...
No! No, please.
Please don't leave me.
Alright, OK. Alright. OK.
Just... I need to get a signal.
I'm just gonna walk away and get a signal, OK?
You 're alright. You 're alright.
Hey, Cara.
Hi, Virgil.
Something wrong?
No, no, I'm alright.
The chair is stuck and I need you to push it out.
Alright. Let me find something.
I'll be right there.
Thanks. OK. 'Bye.
Let's see what we've got.
Stuck, huh?
Hi, Adam.
Who's Adam?
Here we go.
My name is Dr Caroline Jessup.
Yeah, we'll get to you later.
Adam...
I asked who Adam was.
Adam is a patient of mine.
Are you alright?
You feel confused?
Confused?
You don't tell me when to be confused, lady.
You 're not the one who keeps waking up in strange goddamn places with no idea how you got there.
So I asked you a question.
Where am I?
And why would you think I was Adam?
You 're at Walker's Mill.
And you look like Adam.
Hey!
Caroline, are you alright?
Yeah. We're fine.
I was, um... I'm just... I'm talking to, er...
Wes.
Wes.
Morning, Virgil.
Hey, Wesley.
Right. There we go. Beautiful.
- Catch. Catch it.
Nice, alright. Take a shot.
Dad!
Dad.
Yeah.
I need to talk to you.
OK. I'll be right back.
Why are you...
I just met Wes!
Wh...
Why, Dad? Why?
Why do you do this to me?
Because you 've stopped asking questions.
That's all I do. That's all I do all day long.
That's all I do, Dad.
No, no!
You 've stopped asking questions of yourself, Caroline!
You 've developed this fixed system of beliefs which you refuse to submit to any kind of introspection.
So what that means is that you will never have a new thought in your professional life.
You have got to learn to take those ideas, set them to one side and try to move ahead with one big question, which is, "Why?"!
And simply ask, "What?"
To just say, "I don't know."
Just because you 're older, it doesn't mean you 're right.
It might mean that you 've been wrong for longer.
What has been your motivation here?
Has it been to help Adam to discover whatever...
...crisis it is that caused him to fracture his psyche?
Or has it been to simply flat out prove me wrong?
Hmm?
Oh, hon.
Come on, don't!
Alright, everybody go take a shower now.
Honey!
OK, so, Wesley Crite was a frontman for an underground rock band.
He died November 1994.
It was a possible suicide.
At this exact point,
Adam Saber is in prison.
He's just been placed in solitary confinement.
So at this low, low moment in his life, he assumes yet another person who has a story worse than his own.
OK.
OK.
Good.
Hello, Wesley.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I have all the time in the world, Dr Jessup.
I'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's alright with you.
I would first like to ask you a question.
Yes?
Do you hold that doctorate in the name of science or God?
Why do you ask?
That thing around your neck.
Mmm.
I'd-I'd like to consider myself a doctor of science...
...but a woman of God.
There's something I'd like to show you.
November 18, 1994.
Does that mean anything to you?
Get away from me.
Do you know what happened that day?
Get away.
What happened that day?
What do you know about that day?
Get away from me.
Wes.
GET AWAY FROM ME!
David?
Are you alright?
He was here.
Who? Who was here?
Where did you hear that?
I didn't hear it.
I've wrote it.
That's David's song.
Was it ever published?
No.
David made it up in the hospital after his accident, and he'd sing it to himself whenever he became sad or scared.
When he was scared?
It seemed to be a sanctuary for him, a shelter in the storm.
Is it possible that, um...
...the night he was murdered, when he was in the woods, is it possible that he sang this lullaby?
I pray he did.
Hello?
Hey, Dad.
I think that when Adam Saber was a little boy, he may have witnessed
David Bernburg's murder.
And David is an escape from that memory. Maybe Wes is too.
Do you have a home address for Adam?
Why?
Because I wanna know what kind of life
Adam is trying to escape from.
Hey.
Hey there, buddy.
Good boy. Good boy.
Hello!
Hello?
Hey, buddy. Are you all alone?
It's alright. It's alright. I'm gonna come in.
I'm coming in. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Hello?
Oh, shit.
OK. OK, OK.
OK, buddy. Alright.
See if I can find anything.
Here you go. Here you go.
There. Poor thing.
Ugh.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Hello?
Oh, God. Oh, gosh.
Mmm... Ohh...
Ohh.
Ohh.
OK.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
First dead body?
No.
We sent someone to pick up this Adam Saber for questioning.
Shit! Shit.
Um, I-I... I forgot to pick up my daughter. I can't stay.
You don't have to be here.
Thanks.
I got it.
Thank you.
- Did you see me?
- You did a great job, honey.
Really, Dad?
Kenna, come on, we're leaving.
I'll be there in one second.
Hello?
Detective Danton?
It's Caroline Jessup.
Hello.
Adam Saber is at my daughter's elementary school.
You 're sure it's him?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's Brockhurst Elementary.
Alright.
At the soccer fields.
Alright, I'll...
Hi.
...send the car and I'll be there.
As soon as you can. Thanks.
Sammy!
Sammy!
You see?
Samantha!
I told you she'd be here.
No need to worry.
Samantha!
Sammy.
Samantha. Samantha.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I need you to come over here right now.
But, Mom...
Right now! Get over here!
Come on. Come on.
I want you to go and wait with Brody's mom, OK?
Is everything alright?
How did you get here?
I'm not entirely sure.
Sammy was wonderful!
I think she's gonna make...
I want you to stay away from my family!
But you invited me.
I did no such thing.
At the hospital.
What hospital?
When you came to see me.
CC, are you alright?
What did you call me?
Little CC.
Who are you?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Caroline, it's me.
Charles.
I thought we had a rule about not talking to strangers.
But he knew my name.
And he just wanted to talk to me until you got there.
What did he want to talk about?
First he wanted to know family stuff.
Yeah?
Like what we did this summer.
And my birthday.
What about your birthday?
If I liked the books he sent me.
What else?
Then he wanted to know about God and stuff.
What did you tell him?
That I didn't believe.
Why would you say that, honey?
Because if God was real he wouldn't have let Daddy die.
You know, I think...
...I think that God knew how wonderful Daddy was.
And he wanted him in heaven to make it a better place.
It's alright that I don't believe, Mommy.
Why?
Grandpa doesn't believe anymore.
So whatever happens, I'll be with him.
Here.
God loves you.
And he always will, OK?
OK.
What did you do to your back?
Don't know.
It kind of itches.
Oh.
I'll put something on it, OK?
He, Dad, it's me.
Look, I think there's a connection between Adam and his alters.
They all seem to want to know if you have faith.
Adam asked you, Wes asked me,
Charles asked Sammy.
Charles?
Well...
Adam came to Sammy's school pretending to be Charles.
Caroline, Charles is dead.
What? I... Dad, I just talked to him.
He was sick, but he didn't... I mean...
Dad, I'm so sorry.
Me too.
He always had to do everything first.
Are you alright?
Yeah.
It's just a tickle.
I love you, sweetheart.
I love you too, Daddy.
Bye-bye.
I noticed a sketchbook in your room.
You like to draw, huh?
Idle hands.
Moses drowning in an unparted sea.
Mm-hm.
So, I'm seeing this, right?
The shadow's moving. It looks like there's somebody else there, right?
Yeah, but...
But...
...you know.
But... But what?
Cara, this is... Come on, this is Dad.
He's doing what he always does.
He's messing with you.
Can you just find out what it is?
Yeah, sure.
So, uh...
What's the deal?
The deal, Mr Saber, is a body found at your house.
Excuse me?
Male. Approximately 30-50 years of age.
You know him?
OK.
Are you a religious man, Mr Saber?
I only ask as this cross was etched into the victim's back.
Do you recognise this?
Maybe it was burnt or carved in, we're not sure yet.
Does this mean anything to you?
No.
Adam, do you recognise any of these?
Do you recognise them?
Does this cross mean anything to you?
Do you recognise any of these?
I said, "I don't recognise them!"
Are you deaf?!
OK. Excuse me. Excuse me, Detective.
Can I speak to you for a second?
Don't push him on this right now.
You 're not gonna get anywhere.
And I... I think I can help you with that cross.
I've seen it somewhere before.
Yeah.
I saw markings like this in town.
I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to ask.
Dr Jessup, why are you here?
Your textbooks have failed you, isn't that right?
Yes.
So listen.
That's why God gave us two ears but one mouth.
There's the Devil's magic in these hills, that some may try to tend an ailing child or take revenge for a terrible wrongdoing.
Remember this.
Your books may have failed you, but your God has not.
Follow on where the road ends to the very top of the valley.
You 'll see a Holler there.
Ask for the Granny.
Excuse me?
I... I'm looking for the Granny.
It's important that I find her.
I need... I need to...
I need to find out what this is.
I-I think it's some kind of a cross.
Do you know what it is?
Do you... Do you know?
Let me see.
It's no cross.
How are you doing that?
With better eyes than yours.
Can you tell me what it means?
You won't believe. Child!
What the hell is that?
Want a soda?
Mm-mm.
You sure?
Mm-hm.
No way. No freaking way.
Ow! What are you doing?
Sorry, pal.
I need to try something.
Uncle Stephen.
What are you doing?
I gotta check something.
Arggh!
Hold him down. Hold him down!
Keep still!
He'll be fine.
Now will you believe?
It's the writing of the mountains.
This... is shelter.
You have two new messages.
Dr Jessup, this is Detective Danton.
Just wanted to let you know there wasn't enough to hold Adam Saber but we released him into your father's care.
Any luck with that cross? Call me.
Next message.
Jesus, Carrie, where the hell are you?
OK, the darkness on the video, the thing that moves...
...it's a sound wave.
It's a voice.
Carrie, it's a fricking voice. Listen.
Reverend Christian Moore...
...shelter now the faithless!
Hear that?
Cara.
What was that?
Uh, I have no idea. But I do know who Christian Moore is. Or was.
He was born in Burlington,
Alabama, in 1889.
He's one of those good ol' boys, southern faith healers.
He died in... 1918.
That's all the info I got.
However, listen to this. OK.
There's some sort of historical society in Milling Junction.
Now, there's a guy there by the name of Monty.
He has all this information on him.
OK, I'm-I'm... I'm about 50 miles from Milling Junction now.
You can be there in an hour. Go.
You alright?
My throat scratches.
Let me see what I got.
No cough medicines.
Mom says it's not good for you.
Seriously?
Honey works though.
Yeah? OK.
Uncle Stephen.
Yeah?
I think there's something on my back.
Well, my late father made these films right after the Great War.
That's when it came.
The influenza epidemic.
And that's when we met him.
The Reverend Christian Moore.
He was a self-proclaimed faith healer and he told the Holler folks that they didn't need their voodoo medicine.
Just faith in the Lord.
And he had a good number of Holler folk turn their backs on the Granny.
You see, he used, as an example, his own two children.
They were full of health and apparently immune to the ravages of the disease.
And they were strange children, as I remember. Quiet.
Turns out that their silence was for a good reason.
The Reverend had lost his faith and he had had his own kin inoculated against the disease, leaving the others to die.
That's awful.
And that's why the Holler folk did what they did.
What was that?
My father was filming as usual and I accompanied him.
And that's when I found them - the Reverend's children.
They dragged the Reverend to the Granny.
And she handed down her own form of mountain justice for his faithless ways.
And I can't really tell you what happened...
...but to a child of eight...
...it sure as hell looked like that old hag had sucked out Christian Moore's soul...
...and stuffed his gullet with dirt so that it couldn't get back in.
And then she said something that I... I'll never forget.
Reverend Christian Moore, shelter now the faithless.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Doctor Jessup, it's Detective Danton.
Can you hear me?
Yeah. What... Wh-what's the matter?
I just wanna let you know we've dispatched a squad car to your father's location.
They'll be there in a few minutes.
I'm on my way now.
Why?! Why? What's happened?!
There's been a mistake.
Hello?
Dad?
Oh, hey, sweetie.
Dad, is Adam with you now?
Yes. The police dropped him off a while ago.
Can he hear what I'm saying?
I shouldn't think so. He's in his room.
OK, um, Dad, I need you to leave.
Why? What's going on?
You 're in danger.
What are you talking about?
Dad, Adam Saber is dead.
Can you hear me?
Yes, but you 're not making any sense.
The body that I found - that was Adam.
Whoever's with you now is not Adam Saber.
Well, then, who is he?
I don't know who he...
Oh, my God.
Dad...
Dad... Dad!
Dad, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Dad?
Dad, w...
Da...
Dad...
No...
Just pick up, please.
Latham Institute.
Virgil, I need you to run upstairs and check on my dad, OK?
OK. I'll check on him. I'll put you on hold.
Dr Harding? Shit. Shit.
No! Jesus Christ!
Dr... Dr Harding...
Cara... Cara... Cara, you...
Virgil, where... where's my dad?
Something terrible's happened, Cara. I...
He's gone.
He's dead.
What?
I couldn't...
There was nothing I could do.
He's gone.
Wh... Wha...
Wh... What?
I'm so sorry, Cara. So sorry...
Hello?
Hi, sweetie. It's Mommy.
Can you... Can you...
Can you put your uncle on?
Mom wants to talk to you.
He's getting his car keys.
Wh-why? Where are you going?
Come on. Come on.
Sammy, are you alright?
Hey. Sammy's coughing up a storm.
She's got some rash on her back.
Her paediatrician's closed.
They said I should start heading to General.
Cara?
Cara?
Are you there?
A doctor can't help her.
Are you out of your mind, Cara?
She needs to see a doctor.
Think about what you heard on that video.
This man is so dangerous.
Please, you have to bring her up here.
No, you have to listen to yourself.
I'm not taking my niece to a goddamn witchdoctor.
I'm taking her to a hospital.
Please listen to me and bring her here.
No!
Where are we going?
To the hospital. You 're gonna be fine.
Stevo! Wait.
Stay the hell away from us.
Stevo! You have no idea what's going on here, Stevie.
Samantha Jane! Come with me!
Samantha Jane!
Go, go, go, go! Up the stairs.
Come on. In the bathroom.
In the bathroom. Go, go, go.
You 're in great danger, buckaroo.
Hey. Your freak show just showed up in Dad's car.
Keep him away from her, OK?
Stephen, for once in your life, will you listen to your father?!
Here.
Hi, Mommy.
Hey, baby. Hey, do whatever your Uncle Stephen says, OK?
OK.
Now, everything's gonna be OK and I'm gonna stay on the phone with you the whole time, alright?
I'm scared, Mommy.
I know. I know.
The man from the soccer field - he's here.
I know, honey. I know. I know.
Stevo!
He's coming up the stairs.
He's in the house.
Stephen?
Samantha Jane!
Stephen, this is your father.
This is no time to be playing games,
Stephen.
Shh...
Sammy?
Samantha Jane, honey.
You gotta come with your grandpa,
Samantha Jane.
Shh.
Honey?
Please! Damn it, Stevie, open the door!
We don't have much time!
There's a very bad man coming, Stevie!
Open the door!
I can't help you if you don't open the door to your father!
I don't care, man!
Get out of this house now!
Stevie! Stevie!
Stevie!
Ugh!
Sammy!
Arrgh!
Samantha Jane...
Sammy! Sammy! Stephen?
That was an accident, honey.
Listen to me.
You gotta come with me,
Samantha Jane.
Sammy, tell him to put David on the phone.
She wants to speak to David.
David? David's not here, sweetie.
Sammy, put me...
Put me on speaker phone.
Caroline?
Put David on the fucking phone now!
Sammy? Sam... Stephen? Stephen?
Mommy...
...he fell.
Sammy?
Can you come here and get me?
Before he wakes up. Uncle Stephen?
Are you OK?
Tell me where this witchdoctor is.
Come on. You 're fine.
I'm scared!
Don't be scared.
Buckle up.
Come on!
When I cough, it feels like
I wanna throw up, Uncle Stephen.
We're gonna see your mom real soon, OK?
I promise.
Hey! Hey!
Mommy!
I'll carry you, baby.
Give me your hands. It's OK.
Oh, my God. Come on.
Ow! Ow, Mommy!
Let me see.
OK. Drive, Stephen.
Drive straight ahead.
How much further?
It's just a couple more miles.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
I know. I know.
Just go straight. We'll be there soon.
Jesus, I hope you know what you 're doing.
Just keep going straight!
Watch out!
Shit!
Oh, God! Oh, good.
What the hell is that?
It's alright. It's alright.
We're here. It's alright.
You stay here. Stay right here, Stephen.
Come on, honey. Come on.
Oh, it's OK. You 're alright.
I know, I know. It's OK.
Oh, f... Fu...
Shit.
Ah, come on.
Arrgh! Arrgh!
Mom, I don't want to...
No. It's alright. It's OK.
Just show her your back.
She looks scary.
Show her your back.
She's gonna help you. It's OK.
I'm gonna be right here.
Do I have to?
I'm gonna be right here, OK?
Lost your way, did you, child?
From God?
My daddy died.
Terrible thing, to lose a loved one.
Worse thing to lose your faith.
I'm sorry, child.
Why?
Once the sheltering has begun, he will find you.
No. No.
No, no, you have to do something.
She's made her choice.
She didn't make a choice.
She didn't make a choice. She's a child.
We are all God's children.
Please help us. Help... Help her.
She will not be alone.
She will rest with the sheltered ones.
No. No!
Mommy!
Stephen! Stephen!
Cover your eyes, OK?
Don't look. Don't look. Don't.
OK.
Stephen... Stephen?
Stephen...
Don't... Keys... Keys...
Sammy!
Mom!
Come on.
Arggh!
Mommy!
Sammy...
OK. OK. Are you OK?
Alright, baby. OK. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
OK, I'm sorry. OK, sorry.
It's OK. You 're OK. It's OK.
Shh.
Sammy? Sammy, what is it?
Oh, my God. It's OK, baby.
Get it out. Get it out.
Oh, my God. OK.
Mommy, I can't feel my fingers.
OK, baby. It's OK. You 're alright.
It's gonna be alright.
You 're gonna be al...
Ugh!
Sammy!
Mommy?
You 're bleeding, Mommy.
I hit my head.
It's OK. It's OK.
I'm really scared, Mommy.
It's OK. It's OK. Shh... Shh...
Shh. Come on. Come here. Come here.
Come here. It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK. It's alright. It's alright. It's OK.
Shh...
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.
Shh... OK, OK. OK. OK.
Alright. Alright. It's alright.
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Bless the bed that I lay on
Bless me as I lay me down to sleep
I give myself to God to keep
Five little angels round my bed
One to the foot and one to the head
One to sing and one to pray...
...and one to take my sins away.
Amen.
Mommy...
Mommy...
It's OK.
Mommy!
Arggh!
Sammy.
Sammy?
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
Breathe, Sammy.
Oh, God.
Sammy?
We have 182 patients.
Most are horribly deformed, due to inbreeding and birth defects.
Ward "C" is high security.
Each patient in here should be considered dangerous or a danger to himself.
No one can get in or out without first passing through this door.
We can open all the cells at once in case of fire… but the protocol is one cell open at a time.
Thanks, Charlie.
No problem, boss.
I know what you're thinking. But we have to do this for their own good.
This is not a prison.
We hope to rehabilitate the patients if at all possible… and have them rejoin the general population.
Before any cell is opened, you must have an orderly…
Bobby! Bobby!
Let go!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
That just surprised me.
That's all.
You shouldn't wander past the yellow lines.
- They can and will grab you from their cells.
These are the Hilliker brothers.
We call them that because
Mrs. Hilliker found them in the woods… standing over the partially eaten remains of what we think were their parents.
And the little bastards are smart.
Definitely the most dangerous patients in the hospital.
They're just kids.
And the most dangerous?
Yes. Trust me.
The youngest one, the one sucking on the stump of his hand?
- Yeah?
- He chewed off his other two fingers.
We never found them.
We think he ate them.
The middle child. He poked out his own eye with a fork.
Ate it right in front of a nurse.
And the large boy with the mask?
He has abnormally large teeth, which he was sharpening on the stone walls.
We put the mask on him after he bit several orderlies.
Sharpening?
How can he tolerate the pain?
That's the fascinating thing about these children. They can't feel pain.
They have an advanced form of congenital analgesia.
- That's extremely rare.
- Yes.
But it's more prevalent in homogeneous societies.
- Like the inbred communities of West Virginia. 
- Exactly.
- Can they talk?
Just grunts and gestures.
It's their own language.
Never turn your back on them or their cell.
No offense, Doctor. But these are beyond your kind of therapy. Musical or otherwise.
I'd like to work with them, Dr. Ryan.
Maybe after a while.
Why don't we play it safe for now?
Come on. I'll show you the rest of the hospital.
Sure.
Hey, get me out of here!
Gone.
Come here. Get in here.
Get me out.
Hey! Let me out!
Hey, guard!
Huh?
No! No!
No! Oh, no!
No!
I can help you if you just let me go.
I can help you.
No!
No!
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
No!
No!
Oh, please. Don't do this to me.
Boys, you don't need to do this to me.
Please! God, no!
Ohh! Ohh!
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes!
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God!
- You like that?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Come on.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You guys are a bunch of slut monkeys.
Heard of knocking?
Porter has already left. Kyle and Claire are probably waiting for us on the mountain.
My car leaves in five minutes whether you guys wanna be in it or not.
Why don't you just relax and jump underneath the covers for a bit?
I don't think Bridget would appreciate that very much.
I don't really mind.
- I don't mind either.
- Hey!
- Just kidding.
- Five minutes, you rabbits.
Why aren't we going to Aspen this year?
Porter's cabin sucks.
Because my dad lost his retirement and had to sell the house.
- Really?
- Yeah, you should have seen him when he found out.
I thought he was gonna jump off a bridge. Hey.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Where's Porter?
- He went on ahead to get the cabin warmed up.
- Oh.
He must be sick or something
'cause usually Porter's a douche bag.
- Only to you.
- I know. What's that all about?
Um, I don't know. Maybe it's because you keep making passes at me?
He's that insecure?
Is there something you want to tell me,
Kenia? I'm here for a sister.
Uh, fuck off. Fuck off.
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey, man.
- This is my ride.
- Hi.
Hey!
- I am so excited. Aren't you?
- I'm so excited.
- Hey, guys. Sorry we're late.
- Hey.
- Daniel's fault.
- The roads were bad.
So who's driving?
I'm driving.
You drive like a girl.
I want to go fast.
- Thanks. Real nice.
Then you're gonna wanna ride with me.
- Okay.
- There you go.
Hey, Kyle? I heard on the radio there's a huge storm blowing in.
You think maybe we wait?
Do this tomorrow?
It'll be okay, princess.
We'll be at the cabin in an hour.
All right. Let's hit it!
- All right!
- Yeah.
- What about the cars? Are we okay to park here?
- Oh, my gosh.
Jesus, Daniel. You got to worry about everything? They'll be fine.
Let's go already.
All right. Excuse me.
Seriously, Daniel?
- What?
- Check out Daniel.
- What? Safety first!
I'd like to see you laughing when you fall off your snowmobile.
- Uh-huh.
- All right. Let's go!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Let's go!
- Let's do it!
Come on. Let's go already.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!
All right. Let's go!

- You're lost.
- No, I'm not.
Just admit it.
Idiot. It's frickin' freezing out here.
It must have dropped 20 degrees in the last half an hour.
We've got an hour of daylight left.
There's a huge storm blowing in any minute now.
Just give me a minute to get my bearings, all right?
- Hey? Hey!
- What?
We should be going left up there over that hill.
No, I've been to the cabin a hundred times with Porter. It's right. I'm sure of it.
We need to get over that far ridge over there.
Fine. Then let's go.
I'm freezing too.
- Yeah. Come on!
- Come on, guys.
Yeah.
He's making a wrong turn. I know it.
Sorry, guys! I guess
I got turned around!
If we don't find some shelter soon, we're gonna freeze to death!
I say we go back the exact same way we came!
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
Let's turn around… head back down the mountain, and follow your tracks in the snow.
What tracks?
They've been blown away.
- What's that?
- What's what?
That huge, dark shape along the side of the ridge.
I think it's a building!
Frickin'-A! We're saved.
- Come on! Let's go!
- Okay.
I'm freezing!
Come on. Come on.
- Don't slip!
- Thank God.
- Bridget, I could kiss you.
- Ohh.
- It's open. Come on.
Oh, my God.
Honey, you want your ski gear?
Leave it. I've got my bag, and it's freezing!
- Ohh!
- I'm freezing.
- What is this place?
- An old hospital maybe?
- Well, it looks like we're visiting for the night.
- Great.
- Shall we?
- Mmm.
What is this place?
- Holy crap.
- Why is it so warm in here?
Maybe there's a janitor here or something.
They probably keep the boiler going so the pipes won't freeze.
You're really lucky this place was here, man.
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.
- Creepy.
- Oh, it's dusty.
- Gross.
- It's disgusting!
- I'm just glad we're inside.
- Ew! Did you find that in here?
- Yeah.
- Don't touch it.
- That's so creepy!
- Uh-huh.
- Can you guys find something to burn?
Scrap wood or furniture? Something.
- Yeah. We're on it.
- Yeah.
- What about Porter?
- He's going to be expecting us.
You don't think he'd go out in this weather, do you?
No. Porter's way too smart for that.
Maybe you should give him a call.
Let him know we're safe.
Good idea.
My freaking cell service sucks.
Does anyone have a signal?
I'll check. No.
- Nothing.
- Shit.
Kenia, Porter's a really smart guy.
He's gonna know we wouldn't go out in this weather.
You're talking about
Porter being smart?
- Which Porter is that?
Well, he's a hell of a lot smarter than
Kyle, who got us lost. Remember?
I didn't say Kyle was smart either.
Porter's probably nice and toasty right now.
Yeah. I hope so.
Okay. Who's up for a weenie roast? You?
You? You?
I know you are.
All right.
Got it?
Hey.
Scooch, scooch, scooch.
Yay!
All right, guys. I just want to say sorry for the mix-up out there.
I know things could have turned out really bad… but I'm glad we're all okay.
Don't worry about it, dude.
It could have happened to anyone.
It's fine. We're all fine.
We'll go to the cabin in the morning.
I think the weather should be clear by then.
Let's just try to get some rest.
No way! Have you seen this place?
It's fucking fantastic.
Let's check it out.
Do a little exploring.
Trespassing?
God, Daniel.
Wow.
- All right. All right. I'll go with you.
- Yeah, me too.
You girls gonna be okay alone?
- Don't get lost again.
- Thanks.
Wait. You expect us girls to cook dinner?
It's hot dogs.
I think you ladies can handle that.
Well, maybe I don't want to.
That's right, Bridget.
You don't do hot dogs, do ya?
- Fuck you, Vincent.
Let's go.
- Wait. I'll go with you.
- Yeah, me too.
Hey, wait up. I'm coming too.
Wake up.
Hey, check this out.
It looks like somebody's been here recently.
Hunters probably use this to hold up in during the spring runoff.
Do you guys think anyone would actually be here right now?
I mean, that would be really creepy.
No. No one's hunting in this weather.
Ax murderers do.
Just saying.
Hey, this must be the head honcho's office.
"Dr. Brendan Ryan, Chief of Staff."
Well, let's see if the chief had any good stuff.
Oh. What the hell happened in here?
Hey, check out this coat and stethoscope.
Hey, Jenna, hop on my desk.
We're gonna do a porn scene.
- Oh, God.
- Me doctor, you nurse.
- Vince, you mind?
- Do her.
I'm busy with my patients.
Hey! Hey! Get away from me!
So, Miss Perrin.
How long have you been having these reoccurring nightmares?
Well, it all started when I was 12.
I-I felt this presence in my room at night.
Was this about the time of your first period?
You're a fucking pervert.
You know that?
Violent dreams are a direct result of menstruation in young women.
- Had you masturbated yet?
- Ew!
You're fucking disgusting.
Oh! Jackpot.
Looks like the good doctor was a boozer.
Anyone for a snort?
Please tell me you're not gonna drink that.
It's a 30-year-old bottle of scotch.
Thirty years ago, Jenna. Unopened.
Mmm. That is smooth.
To pussy.
Ooh!
- Holy shit.
- What?
That's some fucked-up shit.
What the fuck is that?
A person.
What the hell happened to him?
- Born that way.
- Poor son of a bitch.
Oh! That is so wrong.
- Jesus!
- What was this place?
According to the records, it was the Glenville Sanatorium.
- Isn't that where crazy people are locked up?
- No, that's a sanitarium.
A sanatorium is a hospital that isolates sick people from the rest of the population.
What was wrong with these people?
I don't know.
They're all deformed from what I can tell.
I'm gonna take some of these and read them.
I just hope it wasn't contagious.
- All right.
- Come on. We should get back to the others.
Yeah.
That's a great idea.
He's kind of cute when you're stoned.
You know, in like an E. T. kind of way.
Wow, babe.
You know, you're a lot more fucked up than I thought you were.
- Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, I found a patient ward that's got beds and shit.
Oh, gross. I don't want to sleep on a filthy mattress.
We'll lay our sleeping bags over the top.
It's better than sleeping on the hard floor.
Plus, we get a little privacy.
- Ooh.
- Okay.
We'll be back, guys.
- All right.
- Night.
- So long.
Hey.
- You wanna come check it out?
- Sure.
I'm not enough?
Ah, you are mine.
See? It's not so bad.
Okay.
Okay, I say we all pick a room.
And then everyone puts their keys in a bowl… and we pick to see who sleeps with who.
- You just don't stop, do you?
- It's what I do best.
You got that right.
Hey! I think I just saw somebody.
Ghosts. Awesome.
No, it wasn't a ghost.
I think it was a person.
Well, there's nobody there now.
If you want me to take a look, I will.
No. Nobody here.
Whew.
Oh, my God.
Vincent?
This isn't funny, Vincent!
Vincent, answer me!
- I'm going. This isn't cool. No.
- No, no, no!
- No!
- Don't leave me alone. Come.
Vincent.
Vincent.
Vincent.
Vincent?
Whoa!
You fucking asshole!
Calm down. Trying to have some fun.
Oh, I can't believe you!
- God! He's such a jerk.
Ohh!
Kenia?
- Move!
- Hey, what's up?
He's a fucking jerk.
I scared the piss out of them.
You should have seen it.
You have the mentality of a 10-year-old.
You know that, right?
- Okay.
- I could have fallen in the dark.
You have no idea of the consequences… of your stupid, incessant pranks.
Well, a place this big has gotta have its own generator.
And since you two are afraid of the dark…
I'll see if I can find it and get some heat and lights started.
Finally, you're doing something useful.
Hey, Vincent can be useful in many ways, can't you, baby?
Don't go bragging now, babe.
Ciao, kiddies.
You doing okay?
Okay. That good, huh?
We got gas.
Let's see if you'll run.
Hey. Hey, hey!
See? I told you he was useful.
Sometimes.
Happy now?
Yes. Thank you so much.
All right. Well, let's go have some fun
'cause I found some really cool shit.
Yeah!
- All right.
- Come.
- Ohh!

Whoo!
This place is amazing.
The freaks had their own auditorium.
Can you imagine those guys up there putting on their own play?
It gives a whole new meaning to the term freak show.
Yeah, I bet everyone was a variation of the Elephant Man.
Hey, they watched movies here.
- Hey, let me see that.
- Okay, movie time.
- Shall I fire it up?
- Yeah!
- Who's up for popcorn?
- Whoo!
- Fine.
- Yeah.
They're just creepy.
I think it's kind of sad.
I wonder what happened to them.
Yeah.
You know?
I remember this place now.
My brother used to scare the shit out of me when I was a little girl… with stories about the hillbillies.
What stories?
He said there was a bunch of inbred West Virginia hillbillies… that got rounded up way back when…
- Ew!
- and locked up in this old hospital.
- Oh, my God.
- They're deformed 'cause they kept on screwing each other.
Ew!
He said that's not all they did to each other.
What else?
He said they ate each other. Cannibals.
- Are you serious?
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, right.
- That's an urban legend.
He'd tell me the stories every time we drove through Greenbrier County.
Show's over, folks.
- Yeah.
- I don't know about you guys, but I am going to bed.
Lauren?
- Hey, Jenna? Wanna go?
- That's a good idea.
Yeah, for some nightmares.
Let's go, baby. Bedtime.
Hey, who wants to run the stairs with me in the morning? Anyone?
Wake and exercise?
I think I'll sleep in.
Us too.
What are you doing?
I can't sleep. I'm gonna go explore.
Okay. Don't go fucking with anybody.
They're asleep and it's so not cool.
I get it. I won't.
- I promise.
- Mmm.
Hey, you! Who's there?
You better not be playing with me, dude!
I'll beat the shit out of you!
Porter, is that you?
Porter, when did you get here?
Holy shit. You scared the hell out of me, man.
This place is great, isn't it?
Dude, what are you doing? Let's go.
Dude, are you asleep?
Holy fuck!
Vincent?
Great. We're almost out of weed.
Well, that's 'cause you smoked it all last night.
- Where's my shirt?
- I don't know.
- Here.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, have you seen Vincent?
- No.
- No?
He went exploring last night, and I can't find him.
You haven't seen him since last night?
- No.
- Oh.
- Well, he's got to be around here somewhere.
- I know.
- I'll help you look.
- Thanks.
This place is so huge.
He could be anywhere.
Yeah.
Hey, guys, have you seen Vincent?
- Not since last night, no.
- No.
No? Ohh.
We're, uh… We're looking for Vincent.
Haven't seen him.
I wouldn't worry about it, guys.
We're not going anywhere.
Have you seen it out there?
It's snowing like crazy.
- Hey, Sara, have you seen Vincent?
- Yes.
- Really? Where is he?
- I saw him last night doing his peeping tom bit.
He was watching me and Bridget.
- What about this morning?
- No, I haven't seen him. I've been running for the last hour.
Let's eat. Breakfast anyone?
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll grab our stuff.
- What about Vincent?
- He'll show up.
I'll meet you guys down there.
- Seriously. Go to hell.
Hey, where did all our shit go?
Vincent's probably trying to mess with us, bro.
Don't worry about it.
Just throw some wood on the fire.
Jesus. It's bad out there.
Guys, do you think we should wait for the storm to blow over?
No. Look, I say we pack up, we find Vincent, and we get going.
Yeah. Let's split up into two groups though.
Daniel, you take Bridget, Sara and Lauren and check the upper floors.
Everyone else come with me. We'll check the first floor and the basement.
We'll meet up in the auditorium in half an hour.
I'm… I'm not done eating.
Kyle, come on. Geez.
Does anyone not think it's weird our stuff is gone?
You guys, the sooner we find him, the quicker we can leave.
Let's go.
Here you go, princess.
I'm a princess. Thanks.
You think it's funny?
Oh, wait! Yes.
Let's move it.
Yeah. He's dead for sure.
Shut up, Kyle.
Come on, Vincent!
Vincent, we've got food!
- Vince!
- I really don't like this anymore.
What is that?
- Oh, what is all this?
- Wow.
Well, we're definitely checking this out.
- Wow.
- Whoa.
So, I guess if you didn't follow the program…
- they had some serious slice and dice…
- Get out of here!
We're looking for
Vincent, remember?
- Yes.
- Yeah. Let's go. Come on. Come on.
- Quit goofing around.
- Let's get out of here.
Ward "C." Open the door.
Let's check this out.
They locked them up like animals.
They look like animals.
Come on. Let's keep moving.
What's that?
It looks like a nurse's station.
Vincent definitely would have checked to see if there were any drugs left behind.
- Yeah, probably.
It's blood.
Oh, my God.
All right, stay here, okay?
I'm gonna check it out.
Do you think it's Vincent's?
Uh, I mean, he-he… he could have cut himself on something.
Vince?
Well, I say we each take a hallway.
We can cover more ground that way.
- Mm-hmm.
- Sounds good to me.
This way?
- I guess we're going this way.
- I guess so.
Vincent?
I'm really starting to get worried.
- He'll show up.
- I'm sure he just fell asleep somewhere.
He smoked pretty heavy last night.
He's probably stoned right now, in a corner having a bad trip somewhere.
Yeah. Hey.
- Did you guys find anything?
- Yeah.
- What?
- A small amount of blood.
- We are not alone here.
- What do you mean?
Somebody is fucking with us.
- What?
- I wanna get the hell outta here now.
- They're gonna kill us all!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That looks like Porter's jacket.
That is Porter's jacket.
- Hang on!
Claire!
- Claire! Claire!
Help! Claire!
Don't look up! Hold on!
Claire!
- Claire, hold on!
Oh, God! Claire!
Come on! Come on!
The fucking door's locked! It's locked!
Girls, come on!
- Hurry!
Oh, my God! Shit!
- It won't start!
- Neither will mine!
Shit.
They've stripped the spark plug wires.
- Mine too.
- They sabotaged the fucking snowmobiles!
What are we gonna do now?
We won't last on foot in this storm.
We don't even have fucking jackets.
I say we go back inside and figure out a way to defend ourselves.
- Who the fuck are they?
- The cannibal hillbillies my brother told me about.
Who else could it be?
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for help.
Baby, you'll freeze to death.
I'm the strongest skier.
I've got the gear.
I'll make it down the mountain, and I'll call the police.
- Baby, I really don't think you should go.
- I'm going.
If anybody can make it, it's Lauren.
I'll come back for you.
Okay? I promise.
Be careful.
What are we gonna do?
I'll see you soon.
And now what?
Please, Sara, please!
We can't go back in there.
- We have to.
- No.
The doctor's office…
It has a sturdy door and a lock on it.
All right, it's right near the entrance.
- I can't do that.
- We either freeze to death or we fight.
That's the plan.
Okay.
- We have to get weapons.
- I've got mine.
The rest of us need them too.
This is crazy. We need to get the hell out of here!
As soon as the storm breaks, that's what we're gonna do.
Guys? Guys, look at this.
This is the guy that attacked Claire on the balcony.
It says they were violent, mentally, physically deformed… and showed signs of cannibalism.
- How did they survive out here?
- They're hunters.
And now they're hunting us.
They'll eat anything.
Fuck! They probably turned Porter into porterhouse by now.
Just shut up!
The basement.
- That cage thing.
- What?
Yes. Yes.
That cage downstairs with all the knives and saws in it.
- We should all go together.
- No, I don't think so.
Let's just stay here until help comes.
Look, how about you girls stay here.
Daniel and I will go.
- You lock the door behind us.
- Whoa!
- Thanks for volunteering me.
- We need to do this.
I-I just think we should all go together.
Strength in numbers.
You seriously gonna chicken out on me?
Fine.
- Fine. I'll go.
- Good.
- I'll go with you.
- No. Don't.
I'll be fine. You stay here with Kenia.
Sara, please. Don't.
I'll be right back before you know it.
Okay?
Ready, guys?
Ready as I'll ever be.
Lock the door.
It's not much further.
It's just up here to the left.
- What the fuck was that?
Run!
- Let's just fight him!
- He's got a fucking ax!
Just run!
Over here.
- He's coming. Let's kill him.
- Kill the lights.
Kyle? Is that you?
Sara? Daniel? Is that you?
Help me!
He won't let go!
Help me!
- Go away, you motherfucker!
He's going away.
- Don't open the door.
- We gotta get back to the others.
Fuck him.
If he comes back, we'll kill him.
Come on. Come on!
Shh!
It's clear. Let's go.
Sweet.
Let me go, you fucking freaks!
Kenia? It's us. Are you okay?
- What the fuck happened?
- Hurry!
Open up! Open up!
- Yeah.
Where's Daniel?
He was right behind me.
- We have to go back for him.
- No, no, no!
It's dangerous out there.
They could have got him.
Open the door.
We'll just see if he fell behind.
Daniel? Daniel?
I don't see him.
Okay, we gotta figure out what to do.
No! No! No! Oh!
Oh, God! God, somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
I stabbed him in the arm, and he left.
- Shh! Did you hear that?
It's Daniel. We've gotta help him.
What are we waiting for?
Listen!
Fuck you!
Help…
He's probably dead already.
I'm not gonna leave him out there if he isn't.
Listen! We have to have a plan… if we're gonna get out of here alive, and I have one.
Does it include leaving Daniel to die?
If they have Daniel already,
Bridget's probably right.
But if he's hiding, we need to be organized…
- and have a plan to capture these freaks.
- How?
- Aaah! Oh! Oh! No, no!
What the fuck are you doing?
- That's him. Let's go.
- No! It could be a trap.
- What?
- It could be a trap.
Somebody help me!
They have him, and he's the bait to get to the rest of us.
She is right. Why else would they keep him alive?
I don't care if she's right.
I agree with Kyle and Sara, okay?
- We can't leave him to die.
- Just a minute ago, you said not to go.
Yeah, that's when I thought he was dead. Now I know he's alive.
Fine. I say we vote.
What?
Those who want to stay, raise your hand.
Those who want to go.
Fine. Let's go.
- What do you got?
- Here.
- Come on.
- Come on. You ready?
Come on.
He's in the basement.
What the hell are they doing to him?
God! God, let me… Let me die.
God, let me die!
Wait! Wait!
Think what's down there.
- Uh, the cell ward "C"?
- The kitchen and cell ward "C."
- I'll go check it out.
- You come back to us.
Done.
Mmm!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
God, let me…
I'm sorry. God, let me die!
God, please…
Where is he?
He's in the fucking kitchen.
They strapped him to a table.
It was fucking horrible.
What?
They're stripping pieces of flesh off of Daniel.
They're boiling it in oil, and they're eating him.
They're eating him alive like some fucked-up fondue.
Oh, my God.
How many are in there?
There's three. There's one big guy and two small guys.
Jenna, you take that. You go down the hall to the juncture with Ward "C."
We'll force them out the back door of the kitchen.
When they come to you, you throw the lamp. Okay?
- They're gonna have no choice but to go down to the cell ward.
- Okay.
- Are you ready?
- Let's fucking go.
Ready? Let's go!
Come on!
Let's kill them.
- Yes. Let's do it.
- Wait. We can't just kill them.
What? Why the fuck not?
They killed our friends, and they were gonna kill us and fuckin' eat us.
Yeah, we're not them.
Fuck that! Hey, you. Look at me.
Look at me.
Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
I'm gonna cut your fucking hearts out!
You understand that?
Go get the other kerosene lantern.
We're gonna roast these fuckers alive.
Time for a barbecue, fuckers.
Kyle, don't do this.
- They deserve it.
- Yeah, they do… but you don't.
Don't do this to yourself.
Give me that lighter.
Give me the lighter.
Okay. What the hell are we gonna do now?
We find the spark plug wires, and we leave in the morning… storm or no storm.
Where are the spark plug wires?
- The bastards can't even talk.
Fine. Then we search.
Room by room.
Okay. But somebody has to watch them.
I will.
I won't touch a fucking hair on their head. Okay?
Okay.
Go look for the wires.
Send someone back in a couple hours to relieve me.
We'll take shifts throughout the night.
Hey, you.
Are you hungry?
Come on, take it.
Fuck you, motherfucker!
You thought I was actually gonna feed you?
You know I'm actually gonna kill all three of you, don't you?
I will.
I'm gonna say I forgot something… and then I'm gonna come back… and I'm gonna kill each and every one of you freaks.
Just sleep tight.
There's nothing here.
Guys, this place is so big… we're never gonna find them.
I say we pick another room and keep looking.
No. We need our strength.
If we look all night, we're gonna be no good for tomorrow.
Yeah, but if we can't find the spark plug wires we can't leave.
I'm walking out of here at dawn.
Let's head up to the doctor's office and bed down for the night.
I'll take the next watch.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna relieve Kyle of his shift.
Be careful.
I will. You too.
You want to lock it after me?
I got it.
Okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
It's only the generator.
It's only the generator.
- Oh, God!
Kyle?
Kyle?
Fuck.
Kyle?
Oh, shit! Shit.
- It's Kenia! Hurry! Let me in!
Come on, hurry!
- Come on. Come on.
- What happened?
- Gone.
- Gone?
The three freaks, they're gone.
- And Kyle?
- He's gone too. There's no sign of him.
- What?
- Do you think Kyle killed them?
No. Wouldn't he be here right now if he did?
Okay, we have to get out of here now.
We stay barricaded in until morning, and then we make a run for it.
Everyone agree?
Okay, if we make it till then.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.
I'm gonna go check it out.
Don't get too close.
- Who is it?
- It's the small one.
He's unarmed.
Let's fucking kill him.
This is strange.
This could be a trap.
- The other two could be around the corner.
- But what if they're not?
We can kill one right now and improve our odds.
Let's fucking kill him!
There are four of us, and there's one of him. Let's fucking do it.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, but we go as a group, and we come right back here.
- You ready?
- Yes.
Let's go.
You fuckin' pervert, die!
Die! Die, motherfucker!
Oh, no! No, please, no!
No, no, no!
Why didn't he say anything?
Because the bastards cut his tongue out.
We gotta get back!
We're trapped in here.
They're coming!
Upstairs, quick!
Go. We'll hide in the attic. Go!
This is where they live.
And where they'll come back to.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, now.
Look, coats. Grab some gear.
- No, I'm not putting those clothes on.
- Oh, yes, you are.
- We can survive in these.
- Take this.
- Hurry!
- Let's go.
Head down to the main floor.
See if we can find a way out.
We've got to find a way to lock ourselves in.
Here. Here. Go.
There. That should keep them out for a while.
We need to find a way to get out of here.
We have to climb out a window.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Grates. We're fucked.
They can't all be grated.
To keep the freaks in?
You bet they all are.
- Hey, everyone. Come here.
- What?
The grate has rusted out.
Give me a hand.
- Careful.
- Shit!
The fuckers are at the door.
Hurry!
Stand back.
I'll dig a hole. You guys follow.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Hurry!
I'm out.
- You're next. Get going.
- Okay.
Get going. I'll be right behind.
Clear!
Come on, Kenia!
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!
I'm clear!
Come on, Jenna. Hurry!
Now!
Jenna, can you hear me?
Hold my ankles.
Get me out of here!
- Jenna? Jenna?
- No.
Come on! We gotta get going!
Come on! Come on!
Get up! We have to go!
Come on!
We've gotta keep going!
Follow me. Stay close.
Come on!
We've got to move quicker! Run!
They got our snowmobiles.
Move! Move!
- Keep going!
- Go away!
Please! Go away!
No!
Where are they going?
Who cares? Come on!
Can you stop?
I dropped the fireplace poker.
I gotta go back and find it.
- We don't have time for that.
- It's a good weapon. We need it.
Stay with Bridget, okay?
I've gotta go back.
Come on! Come on!
- Oh, God.
- They're coming in both directions.
- What?
- I don't see any lights.
- They turned them off.
Get down and hide. Get down.
- I can't do this. I can't do this.
- Get down.
I can't do it.
- Bridget!
No!
Kenia? How bad is it?
I don't know. It fucking hurts.
- Come on. Come on.
- They got Bridget.
Okay, let's get you to the tree line.
Then I'll go back for her, okay?
Come on.
We've gotta get your jacket off.
Ow! Fuck.
- Just do it.
- You ready?
Okay, baby.
That should slow the bleeding.
Go find her.
You'll be all right here?
I'll be right here. Okay? Okay.
Bridget! Where are you, Bridget?
Hang on! Bridget, I'm coming!
Sara?
Bridget?
Bridget!
Bridget? Sara?
Sara. Sara.
Oh, my God!
No! No! Bridget?
Sara! Where are you?
Sara!
Oh, my God!
Sara!
Please… Please help me!
Anyone.
No. No!
No!
Sara!
Yes! It worked.
Good job.
Let's get the hell out of here.

He's just like one of the family.
All my friends have one...
Hi honey what's going on?
I know what I want for Christmas.
Hi, my name's Blinky...
...and I just want to be your friend.
Will you be my friend?
It's officially the best Christmas ever.
I'll never get sick of him.
Music plays
Muffled shouting.
Ready or not here I come...
I found you.
Yeah, I got bored waiting around.
Would you like to play another game?
Sure.
Muffled signs of parents arguing in background.
- Stop counting.
No problem.
Why did you stop counting?
- I'm sorry, would you like me to continuel?
- Yeah.
And I want you to stay completely still for the next 24 hours.
No problem.
Clean this!
No problem, I like to clean things.
Why did you move?
I told you not to move.
I told you not to stop counting.
I'm sorry, would you like me to continue?
You have to do everything I say, I own you!
No problem.
What use are you anyway? All you're good for is cooking and cleaning and playing stupid games!
Can you make my parents stop fighting? Can you do that?
No problem.
I could tell you to kill everybody, and you'd just stand there blinking like an idiot!
No problem.
What does it matter? Go on...
Kill my parents, kill me.
- No problem.
- Kill the dog, kill everyone.
- No problem.
No problem, no problem, no problem, no problem...
Mom!
No problem, no problem, no problem...
Blinky's broken.
No problem, no problem, no problem, no problem...
What did you do to him?
I didn't do anything, I think he's broken or something.
We need to get a new one.
Just turn him off and turn him back on again.
And if you make another mess like that I'm going to make Blinky clean and cook you for dinner.
I didn't do it, Blinky did it!
Don't start with me, I am not in the mood.
Clean it up!
No problem, no problem, no problem, no problem...
Hi my name's Blinky and I just want to be your friend.

Stop looking at me like that.
What do you want?
I just want to be your friend.
I did what you asked
Did I do good?
I just want to be your friend.
Lets be frrrrieeeends...
I don't trust him.
I don't understand you Alex.
Why would he hurt Rosie?
It makes no sense.
I just don't trust him.
Why won't you believe me?
Because you're bored with him and you're just trying to make us buy a newer one, that's why.
A clear frontrunner has appeared in the so-called robotics race.
Shellcore has announced that its prototype defence unit codenamed Warmachine...
...is ready for public testing after several expensive setbacks.

You're eating him.
Did I do good?
Shellcore has issued a full product recall and full refund. please call....
Ready or not, here I come...
Hi, my name's Blinky and I just want to be your friend.
This is J.T.L. Morning News.
This is Holly Chadwick.
Thanks for joining us.
We have a great show in store for you this morning.
Well, it's a great morning to be in the studio.
Authorities have confirmed an avian flu outbreak.
Forecast, cloudy skies...
Good morning.
Reporting from Brighton.
This will be a different scenario
if the virus changes in a way that allows transmission between humans.
- So, let's get started.
Yet again today,
another group of dolphins became stranded.
CO2 emissions have dramatically increased in...
Are there any real threats that you know of?
Not at all.
Environmentalists are trying
to determine the cause of death.
At alert level six,
W.H.O. guidelines for governments...
Your socks are so cute! I like them.
Police say they've seen similar cases recently
of people behaving strangely.
The U.N. health agency is not likely
to recommend official travel restrictions.
It's a little bit unsettling.
They're not physicists.
They're not engineers.
They think it's just gonna go away.
They live in a fantasy parallel universe.
Right on top of the man, beating him.
The man is bleeding.
Twenty-one confirmed cases.
All the talk about a doomsday is a big hoax.
The subject growled at him
and continued to maul the victim.
The best estimate is about 15,000 in the U.K.
We don't know if this is spreading.
Rhythms of change...
So far there's no manifestation.
Monitors have arrived, even carrying them...
With that much public at risk, we cannot...
They're trying to move us on, trying to tell the journalists to get out.
Wake up!
- Oh, creatures in our bed...
- No sleeping!
Oh, you're getting very big.
- What do you want to eat?
- Pancakes!
We got a lot more sunshine today.
You have to only say one word.
Hey, by the way, what do you want for your birthday?
Say a puppy.
A puppy.
You mean a stuffed animal puppy?
Because that we can do.
Scusi.
Good morning.
That looks yummy.
She gets the bigger one?
- Yeah, sorry.
- She's tiny.
Did you pack your, um, inhaler?
Bathroom sink.
- In a minute?
- Scootch! Go.
The government has declared martial law.
Daddy, what's martial law?
Uh...
Martial law is like house rules, but for everybody.
Were you ever in places like that with your old job?
Mmm-hmm.
But I quit my old job so I could be with you.
Do you miss it?
No, I like my new job.
All you do is make pancakes in the morning!
Yeah, but I'm really good at it.
Look who I found!
- Oh!
Here comes the number 12 train!
It's not Subway Sam, is it?
You want more pancakes?
Good.
Go, go, go. Come on, scootch!
- At least...
- Move it on out.
Hey! Plates in the sink!
- Later!
- Do that when we get back!
Uh... Does it live in the jungle?
Oooh.
No.
Do you eat it on Sundays?
No.
Does it live on the Great Plains of Africa?
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, I guess, yeah.
Do people keep it in pens all its life and harvest it for meat?
- That's really gross!
- Gross!
Dad!
Is it an animal you'd have for a pet?
- Yes.
- Is it a cat?
- Yes.
Ha ha ha.
- Okay, now we have another one.
- Do another one.
- You totally got one!
Why are there so many?
It's like, three in the last five minutes.
- What is going on?
The World
Health Organization has been
tracking the recent outbreak of rabies
that began in Taiwan and has now been reported in over 12 countries.
Responding to allegations he hasn't done enough to prevent the spread...
Can we try BBC?
You're not British anymore, baby.
You lost your accent a long time ago.
Except after two bottles of wine.
Am I British?
Yeah, your grandma is.
- Hey!
- Yo!
He's just gonna keep going, Daddy?
Hold on, guys.
Daddy, be careful on the road.
It's okay, baby.
Can be transmitted between species
commonly from a bite from an infected animal.
Our best recommendation is to stay away from densely populated areas.
Hey, yo! You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.
- You need anything?
- No. You know what's going on?
No, man, I don't know anything.
It's crazy.
Gerry?
Get back in your car right now!
Remain with your ve...
What are we doing?
That's our way out of here.
I want my blanket!
Baby, it's packed right now.
Snuggle with Subway Sam, okay?
My blanket!
Rach?
Rachel, baby, you've got to get back in your seat.
- Baby, we need you in your seat.
- Put your belt on!
Rachel, right now!
- Gerry?
- Rach, get your belt back on!
- You okay?
- You okay?
- Rachel, sweetheart?
- Rachel, you hurt?
- Connie?
- Are you okay? It's okay.
We should get out.
Everybody out of the car.
We've got to get out of the city.
Her door won't open!
Rachel, go out that side.
Okay, you have to climb over, honey.
Out of the way!
Move it!
Come on, honey. Come on.
Sweetheart, are you okay?
Let's go. Let's get off the street.
What is that, Gerry? What is that?
I don't know!
Get to the RV.
Subway Sam!
Here comes the number 12 train! One.
Two.
- What's happening?
- Three.
Four.
- Five.
Six.
Seven.
- Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
Train's in the station!
Gerry!
- Watch out!
We're pulling back on Fifth Street!
Containment is a fail.
- Try to relax.
Give yourself air.
In and out.
- Come on, baby, try to relax.
Gerry? We left my purse in the car.
Where's her spare?
I'm gonna go check your backpack, all right?
Do you want to be with her?
Rach, you'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.
Hey, hey, you breathe through your nose.
Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me.
You're gonna be all right.
You've done this a hundred times.
Look at me. Look at me.
Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth.
Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy.
We gotta move.
Okay.
Good. Good. Look.
Look at me, look at me.
Rach, breathe through your nose.
No, no, no, no...
You're gonna be all right.
- Look at me.
- Daddy, what are those things?
Honey, find us some water.
Okay? Something to drink.
It's Thierry.
Where are you?
Airborne.
Lower East Side to Turtle Bay.
It's all gone. We barely made it out.
- Tell him to go south.
- No, no, we need visual confirmation.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What is this?
We don't know. How close were you?
Face to face.
Good, honey, good.
Daddy.
Connie, give me that.
Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey.
Where are you?
95, heading north.
- Okay. Okay.
All right.
We'll try to get a helicopter to you.
I'll call you back with an extraction point.
Can you hold out for another hour?
Do we have a choice?
This is not for old time's sake, my friend.
I'll need you.
I need you back.
Don't forget about us.
What do you mean, we've lost Boston?
All right. Good luck, Gerry.
Okay.
Good, honey. Keep it going.
It's gonna be all right.
- Come here. Stay close.
- Super close.
Take my hand.
Get her medicine,
I'll get us something to eat.
I'll meet you back here.
Stay close, honey.
What do you need?
Albuterol.
They outgrow the asthma supposedly.
And this shit, too. It's magic for my kid.
Thank you.
- Daddy!
- Connie?
Daddy!
- Connie?
- Daddy!
- Where's Mommy?
- Gerry!
Gerry!
Karin?
- Karin?
- Gerry! Gerry!
Get off of me!
Get off of me! That's all I have.
- Gerry!
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Gerry.
Multiple 11-99s at Washington Park.
Please, send units.
We're falling back on Reed Street.
Two Robert
12, units need backup.
Mobile ops is down. Please respond.
Two Robert 12, are you there? Copy.
- Girls!
- Responders, Code 3, Code 3.
Rachel, quick, come on.
No.
No!
We got to get out of here.
We got to get off the street.
Gerry.
Apartments?
Hey. Yeah.
- Gerry?
- We're in Newark.
We're stranded.
Apartment buildings, 23rd.
If we can get to the roof, can you get someone to us?
- Not tonight.
- When?
The earliest would be sunrise.
Sunrise.
Tell him I got flares.
We'll be on the roof with flares.
Listen, Gerry, I will move mountains to get you out here.
- Come here, baby.
Go! Go! Go!
- Baby, in here!
- Come on. Quick!
Gerry!
Inside, girls!
By the stairs. Inside, inside!
Wait!
Wait.
Up, up. It's okay, baby.
Run! Run! Go, Rachel!
Go!
Go!
Keep running, baby.
- It's all right.
- To the top.
Go! Go!
Go!
Run!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
I need a new flare!
This asshole's about to get through!
Where's Connie? Connie?
- Connie?
- Connie!
- Let me in!
- Connie!
- Baby?
- It's not her. It's not her.
- Let me in!
- Connie!
Let me in!
In, in, in! In!
Thank you so much.
- I'm Tomas.
- Hey, Tomas.
My mom's cooking everything before it starts to stink.
That's smart.
You guys all right?
It's all right.
It's okay.
Are you guys hungry?
Yes, thank you.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
You want some juice?
The following message
is transmitted at the request of the
New Jersey State Police Department.
Authorities recommend that the following actions
should be taken by all the members of the public.
Stay indoors if at all possible.
Have enough food and water supplies for sheltering
for one to two weeks.
The following message is transmitted at the request
of the New Jersey State
Police Department.
An unidentified virus strain is rapidly
spreading across the state of New Jersey.
She was crying.
Hmm.
Thanks, Tommy.
I used to work in dangerous places and people who moved survived, and those who didn't...
Movement is life.
You have a better chance if you come with us.
You need anything else before you leave?
Okay. Come on. Come on.
We should have left with them.
There is nowhere to go.
What's going to happen when the food is gone?
Okay, come on.
I'm scared.
Connie, there's a helicopter waiting for us on the roof.
Keep your eyes on Mommy and Daddy, okay?
Be ninja quiet.
Just a walk in the park.
How do we know they're coming?
They're coming.
Ready?
- Okay, come on, guys.
Come on! Come on!
Up, up, up.
Come on, baby.
Go, go, go!
- Come on, baby!
- Go, go!
Go, girls! Gerry!
Come on. Gerry!
Girls, get back!
Watch out!
- Go!
- Go, go, go!
Come on, faster, girls!
Lieutenant, I've got no contact.
I say again, no contact.
Let's go, let's go!
Karin!
- Karin!
- Yeah.
Go through the door!
Gerry?
There they are!
Ace, we have positive contact.
That's our target! Get us down!
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- Baby, get back.
Daddy!
Gerry?
- Gerry, what?
- Stay back!
Baby! No!
One thousand seven.
One thousand eight.
Daddy, get off the edge!
- Gerry, please?
- One thousand ten.
One thousand eleven.
I got it in my mouth.
You're okay. You're okay.
- Go! Go!
Come on. Come on.
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, let's go! We got to go!
You got her?
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Traffic en route, altitude 5-7 thousand.
Heading 250. Turn right, heading 075, once clear.
Remain below 4,000.
Clear to land, heading 040, wind 060 at five.
Follow L.S.O. directions.
Prep for immediate dust off.
Gerry.
Thank you.
Good to see you, my friend.
Tango five, this is Argus command.
Cleared for take-off.
Tango five. Wilco.
Karin, to the right.
This is good, right?
Bunk beds!
Your bunk beds are number two, three and six.
Please make yourself at home.
You want to get up here?
- There you go, sweetheart.
- That's good.
We're not dropping anchor again.
You're safe.
It's not me I'm worried about.
They're safe.
Baby.
It's bigger than our old apartment on 72nd.
Need anything, Karin?
Water.
I'll organize.
Is this worldwide?
Is anyone doing better than we are?
Baby. Go talk somewhere else.
Okay.
The President is dead.
Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.
Reports of gun battles in the streets of the capital.
Your parties are panicking.
The bigger cities are the worst off.
The airlines were the perfect delivery system.
Carnival cruise vessel Dream has been given permission to join.
Twenty seven knots south and closing.
How soon are they showing symptoms after contact?
The provisional government currently considers northern Minnesota to be a potential safe zone.
Have you recorded any instance where a person was bitten but not infected?
How the hell do I know if Russia's fallen?
Sir, I cannot action that order.
Colonel, I'm sorry, but we cannot facilitate an evacuation for you or your men.
Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.
Malnutrition. Dirty water.
No gas for the winter or transportation.
No bullets to fight.
And it has spread to all corners of the globe.
The question that we have got to address is what the hell is it?
About 5% of the population aren't affected immediately.
It is viral. it has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.
And like any virus, once we find its origin, we can develop a vaccine.
- We find it, contain it...
- That's Dr. Fassbach.
Virologist from Harvard.
The analogy I keep coming back to is Spanish Flu.
Spanish Flu?
It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920, it killed 3% Of the world.
He's our best bet at figuring out what this thing is.
You all read the same email I did,
- and it said "zombies."
Are you completely out of your mind?
So, the earliest mention of the word "zombie" was in a memo from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.
We haven't had contact with them since.
But this could lead us to the origin.
If we knew where this thing started, then we'd have a chance of developing a vaccine to stop it.
So we send in Dr. Fassbach there to look for the source.
He's just a kid.
You're right.
Attention on deck!
At ease!
Mr. Under-Secretary.
The Under-Secretary here says you were his best investigator when you were at the U.N.
I want to send you in. With a team.
Help Dr. Fassbach find whatever it is he needs.
You brought...
I wanted for the circumstances to speak for themselves.
No.
Captain, I'm not your guy.
You were on the ground during the Liberian Civil War.
Investigated Chechen war crimes.
Sri Lanka in '07.
Places you and I both know
Dr. Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.
Gerry, a handful of SEALs will go with you as security force.
No.
My guys will get you in, you assist the doctor, pursue any leads, my guys will get you out.
We do the heavy lifting.
I can't help you. I can't leave my family.
Take a look around here, Mr. Lane.
Each and every one of these people are here because they serve a purpose.
There's no room here for non-essential personnel.
There's a long line of people waiting for one of those bunks.
You want to help your family, let's figure out how we stop this.
It's your choice, Mr. Lane.
Simple.
You don't work for them anymore.
- Karin...
- You might not remember
What this job did to you, but I do.
So do not ask me to say yes to this.
I have to go.
They're going to kick us off the ship.
What?
If I go, you, the girls, Tommy, have a place to stay.
If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.
What about Thierry?
Can't he do anything?
Men like Thierry aren't in charge of anything anymore.
You keep this with you.
I'll call in once a day.
As long as I make that call, everything's gonna be okay.
I'm coming back.
Okay?
We're going to make the best of it.
As we do.
Like we do.
Okay, baby doll,
Daddy's got to go to work.
I'm not a baby.
Okay.
Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.
I'll be back soon.
Yeah?
All right, tough guy...
Take care of the ladies for me?
Yeah.
Deal.
You're awesome.
Daddy's coming back.
This way, sir.
Look.
We don't know what we're walking into.
So we do what they say. Okay.
If they move, we move.
If they stop, we stop.
If things were to get crazy, just focus on their boots, focus on their voices, and we'll be all right.
- Mmm-hmm.
- These guys are hammers.
And to hammers, everything looks like nails.
I heard that.
You were meant to.
So, you see something that's important, you call it out and we'll make it happen.
Okay.
You think we're gonna find anything?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna find something.
Mother Nature is a serial killer.
No one's better.
More creative.
But like all serial killers, she can't help the urge to want to get caught.
What good are all those brilliant crimes if no one takes the credit?
So she leaves crumbs.
Now, the hard part, why you spend a decade in school, is seeing the crumbs for the clues they are.
Sometimes the thing you thought was the most brutal aspect of the virus, turns out to be the chink in its armor.
And she loves disguising her weaknesses as strengths.
She's a bitch.
Attention
D.C. has gone dark. I repeat,
D.C. has gone dark.
The Capitol evacuation has been suspended.
All available resources should be directed to Naval Station Norfolk.
All non-essential personnel
given F-6 status and in groups A through E
need to report to the flight deck for relocation.
Groups A and B relocating to Orlando
should be on the stern clear of the landing zone.
I say again, all non-essential personnel given F-6 status
need to report to the flight deck.
Choppers are inbound for immediate relocation.
Mommy, is this dinner?
Yes, sweetheart.
Water here tastes funny.
It's jet fuel, young lady.
He's joking.
I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out.
Probably because there's too many people on this ship.
Everybody wake up.
We're on approach to Camp Humphreys.
Most of the base is dark, and no one is manning the tower.
We're running on fumes, so there's really no choice,
I've got to put us down.
So buckle up.
Hold up.
Keep your finger off the trigger.
Okay.
Fassbach! Wait!!
Damn it.
Move back!
Friendly! Friendly!
Keep it down. Keep it down.
What is this? What happened to him?
He slipped. He's dead.
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
Okay, I'm good!
- Who was it? Who fell?
- Skilken.
- Hold! Clear.
- Hold.
I want an ammo count, then you reload your mags!
Yes, sir!
My boy who just died out there was 23.
He was 23.
You want to tell me why?
Because the guy who just shot himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.
What are you talking about?
He was supposed to be our best hope.
Well, he's not our best hope anymore.
Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.
He didn't have to, you know.
None of them did.
We're still trying to figure out what the hell this thing is.
Well, shit happens.
The doctor would have strongly agreed with you.
How do we go about refueling?
When I say so. And very carefully.
The noise, are they drawn to it?
Yeah. Sound draws them.
Body shots only seem to slow them down.
Head shots do the trick, but just to be safe we tend to burn them when we can.
- You fought any Zeke yet?
- Yeah.
- Where?
- Philly. Newark.
Bad?
- What about Houston?
- St. Louis?
- Baltimore?
- Atlanta?
Detroit?
Guys, I'll be honest with you,
I don't know of any place back home that's doing very well.
All right...
If the other guy was a virologist, what do you do?
There was a memo sent from this installation 11 days ago.
It had the word "zombie" in it.
Do you know anything about it?
Yeah.
It was an email, not a memo.
Pretty obvious nobody back home bothered to read it.
Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.
Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten trying to get this man handcuffed to the cot.
Now, our colonel said he was the first one.
This colonel, is he around?
Oh, yeah. He's right here.
The guy who's shackled, do you know who bit him, what bit him?
He was the base doctor.
He'd just returned from the field.
He'd been sent out to verify the death of a soldier
who had just gone AWOL the week before.
Some villagers had found this guy
foaming at the mouth, oozing some kind of black tar.
Then he tried to bite one of them.
They shot him, tied him up, threw him in a barn.
That's all we know, except the doctor comes back here and begins attacking his patients.
This soldier, do you know where he came from?
No.
Anyone he might have come in contact with?
No.
There's got to be records.
You are welcome to take a look if you want.
Then the origin could have come from anywhere.
It's a shame you had to fly all the way out here to figure that out.
How did you all escape this?
The expenditure of ammunition.
Is that how you tweaked your leg?
No, shit's been bugging me a while.
This prick stands right in the mix, while seven or eight of them turn Zeke all at the same time.
But they got no time for OI' Dirty Bastard here.
Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.
Got no time for his lucky ass.
Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?
The ones I saw bitten turned in 12 seconds. Same here?
Five or 10 minutes.
Yeah, Davidson went and he turned in 10 minutes.
"Stevie?"
"Captain Spekes! Oh, my God!
My God! My God! Are they eating me?"
Who's that?
Waste no time on that freak.
He's C.I.A.
Got caught selling guns to North Korea.
Davidson, he turned in 10 minutes.
That doesn't sound viral to me at all, sports fans!
You're with the C.I.A.?
But they're not with me.
And who are you?
Oh, my God!
Captain, put on the World Music!
The day is saved!
Why'd you sell guns to the North?
Why not?
Are they surviving this?
Indeed they are.
Using your guns.
Guns are half-measures.
How then?
All right.
They took away the Zekes' exponential power.
They pulled the teeth of all 23 million in less than 24 hours.
The greatest feat of social engineering in history.
It's brilliant.
No teeth, no bite.
No great spread.
Bullshit.
More books, fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.
Now, why do you have to burn them to ashes to get them to finally stop?
Why do they move like a plague?
Why is Israel winning?
How is Israel winning?
They sealed off their entire country days before the undead attacked man.
First to know, first to act.
People have been building walls there for two millennia.
Mmm. Right. Yeah, but, finish all those thousands of years of work a week ago?
Impeccable timing is all.
You want answers?
Jurgen Warmbrunn.
That's the man in Jerusalem you want to see.
You ever seen anything like that?
Hell, no.
We're going to Jerusalem.
I'm your co-pilot.
Oh, hang on.
Hang on. Hang on a minute.
- Hello?
Gerry?
- Honey?
- Gerry, can you hear me?
Karin?
Hello?
- God damn it!
Give me your hand.
No way. No.
My mother. Dallas.
Probably pacing a hole in the floor right now if she's still there.
Better chance of you seeing her before me, that's all.
It's a big plane. We got a lot of room.
Better the devil you know than the one you don't.
You'll be all right.
Just pedal your ass off.
Make sure Maverick here keeps the nose of that plane pointed towards the sun.
Just remember, don't lock the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.
Tell me 10 more times.
- You good?
- Right here.
All right. Don't rush.
We've got one chance to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.
If you ain't a crack shot, don't aim for the head, just get Zeke on the ground.
Remember, "Spine's divine, those knees they work just fine!"
Let's go, lights out!
Alpha in position.
Bravo moving out.
Remember, these things are drawn to sound.
So I need you close to target before I bring you the truck.
Now there's only one way we're getting you on that plane,
and that's quietly.
- Shit!
God damn it!
Shut that thing off!
Looks like we just woke the dead.
Out of respect for others,
please turn off all pagers and cell phones.
We got to move.
We've got to get out of here, let's move!
Go, go, go!
Whoo!
I'm gonna clear a path through Zeke!
You pedal like hell!
Come on, boys,
I need head shots! Tap 'em out!
I want to see some Zeke on the ground!
You're kidding me.
I'm a God damn Zeke.
I got you, Captain. Just say the word.
It's all right, boys.
I got this one.
- God damn it.
- We got enough!
We need to detach the fuel line!
Israel better pay off.
All right, I have instrument, but only on single prop.
You'll have to talk me through it.
Okay, we're clear.
Okay. Give me all the lights.
Switch on the anti-icing.
- Where?
- The red knob.
- Got it, got it.
- Set up our heading 020 for departure.
- We got to move!
- Set flaps 15 degrees.
Flaps 15.
All right, we are all set.
Let's get out of here!
Make it steep.
- Gerry?
- Hi, baby.
Hi. Hi.
I tried to call you.
I know, I was...
It was bad timing, I was running around.
Are you okay?
Yeah, every/thing's okay. I'm okay.
That's the spirit.
Yeah.
Listen,
Korea didn't work out.
Now it looks like we're gonna have to go to Israel.
Try to get some rest on the flight.
How are the kids?
Um...
I think...
They're really... They're good.
I got Connie right here.
Baby?
Attention, unidentified aircraft.
You are in a restricted airspace and not clear for landing.
Jerusalem tower, Reach 394.
Pan, pan, pan.
Request immediate landing.
Contact Mossad, office of Jurgen Warmbrunn.
Special Envoy, United Nations.
Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out.
I'll be back before dark.
The problem with most people is that
they don't believe something can happen until it already has.
It's not stupidity or weakness.
It's just human nature.
How did you know?
Gerald Lane.
Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad about his employer, the U.N., back in 2010.
Caused a few ripples.
Sidelined your career.
Thought you'd have parlayed those ripples into a self-righteous book.
No nose for profit.
How did Israel know?
We intercepted a communique from an Indian general saying they were fighting the Rakshasha.
Translation, zombies.
Technically undead.
Jurgen Warmbrunn.
High-ranking official in the Mossad.
Described as sober, efficient, not terribly imaginative.
And yet you build a wall because you read a communique that mentions the word "zombie"?
Well, when put like that,
I'd be skeptical as well.
In the '30s, Jews refused to believe they could be sent to concentration camps.
In '72, we refused to fathom we'd be massacred in the Olympics.
In the month before October 1973, we saw Arab troop movements, and we unanimously agreed they didn't pose a threat.
Well, a month later, the Arab attack almost drove us into the sea.
So we decided to make a change.
A change?
The Tenth Man.
If nine of us look at the same information and arrive at the exact same conclusion, it's the duty of the tenth man to disagree.
No matter how improbable it may seem, the tenth man has to start digging on the assumption that the other nine are wrong.
And you were that tenth man.
Precisely.
Since everyone assumed that this talk of zombies was cover for something else,
I began my investigation on the assumption that when they said "zombies," they meant zombies.
Was patient zero from India?
That's the problem.
There's so many potential sources in play that no one knows where it began.
The organ trade in Germany.
Strange examples of violent behavior across the Asian peninsulas.
Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps spreading, and we do what we can.
These are the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.
Two of 10 portals through the security perimeter into fortified Israel.
You're letting people in.
Every human being we save is one less zombie to fight.
It's okay.
If I could get into India, where would I start? Who would I speak with?
India's a black hole.
Forget about patient zero.
I can't do that.
It's too late for me to build a wall.
I'm running out of time. I need specifics.
- I need answers...
- I don't have answers.
All you can do is find a way to hide.
Get troops down there.
It's too loud! It's too loud!
They're coming over the top!
- Shit!
Command, we have a breach at Salvation Gate.
They're coming over the wall!
Get him to Jaffa Gate.
She'll get you out of here, she'll get you to your plane!
Stay low!
Wrong way! Wrong way!
Go to landing point B.
Roger, we are inbound to landing point B.
Hawk 5, almost there.
E.T.A. one minute.
Hawk 5. Hawk 5, you're patched in. Over.
This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully.
The city is breached, and they're heading towards the airport.
- One thousand one.
One thousand two.
One thousand three. One thousand four.
- One thousand five.
One thousand six.
One thousand seven.
One thousand eight.
We got to move.
You'll be all right.
You're not gonna turn.
You're not gonna turn!
We got to move.
- We got to move!
5 going down.
Chopper 5 is down.
I say again, chopper 5 is down.
L.Z. is overrun.
Tower, Reach 394.
Requesting immediate departure.
Tower to 394.
Proceed to runway four.
Good luck out there.
No!
There! That one!
Stop. Stop.
Go! Go!
Get them out of here!
Stay calm, please.
Stay calm.
Come on. Go, go, go.
What's your destination?
I don't know. We were headed here, but I don't know.
I'm Gerry, by the way.
Segen.
Segen.
First or last?
Just Segen.
So, what we're doing, we've got to change this bandage and we're gonna clean it.
Okay?
You okay? Okay?
Okay.
Come on, gut up. Gut up.
Here we go.
We're almost there.
Okay. Big breaths.
Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.
Here we go.
Come on. Good.
Last step. Last step.
Big breath.
Good job. There it is. Okay.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.
Very good. Okay.
You a doctor?
No.
I've had some training in the field.
How did you know?
Cutting it off...
How did you know it would work?
I didn't.
Now I'm just a liability.
This prick stands right in the mix, while seven or eight of them
turn Zeke all at the same time.
Is that how you tweaked your leg?
No, shit's been bugging me a while.
Got no time for his lucky ass.
Now, the hard part is seeing the crumbs
for the clues they are.
And sometimes the thing you thought was the most brutal aspect of the virus
turns out to be the chink in its armor.
I don't have answers.
All you can do is find a way to hide.
Gerry?
Are you okay? Where are you, baby?
What's happening?
I love you. I'm sorry.
But you've got to get Thierry now.
I'll find him.
- Thierry! Thierry.
- Excuse me. Karin.
Gerry needs you. I love you.
Gerry? Where are you?
On the last flight out.
Listen, my phone is dying and I need some quick intel.
You gotta locate the closest medical research facility.
A C.D.C., a W.H.O., something that makes vaccines.
- And the closest airport to it.
- I don't understand.
No time to explain.
Just make it happen, man.
Okay, okay.
But, Gerry,
I still don't know where you are.
Well, go and find out what he needs.
You're gonna want to take this.
Take it.
Your battery is dead.
We made contact with Cardiff Airport, Wales.
Your people directed us.
There is W.H.O. research facility nearby, but they are not sure it's still operational.
This is location.
Can we make it?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain.
I'm glad to report that we are on our final approach
to Cardiff Airport in Wales.
All European airports are under lockdown.
But we have been given priority status and cleared for landing.
We will be allowed to disembark.
We are very, very lucky.
Hey. Who do you belong to?
What's there?
- What is it?
You... Bags.
We need trolley and bags.
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Bravo 160 heavy.
Emergency descent!
Prepare for impact.
Got to move.
Come on, come on.
Give me something good.
Sir, Cardiff Airport lost contact with the plane.
Lane is M.I.A. I'm sorry, sir.
Chopper inbound for immediate relocation.
I say again.
All non-essential personnel given F-6 status
need to report for immediate relocation.
Ma'am?
Thierry would like a word with you.
Captain, it's only been 48 hours.
He's a resourceful man. There's every chance he could have survived.
Sir, I gave him my word we would look after his family.
Yes, sir. I understand.
Okay. Let's go. We're good.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
You're a tough bastard.
And a lucky one.
Who are you?
I came here with a... With a woman.
Is she still...
Who are you?
Why have you come here?
Why do you keep looking at him?
'Cause he's the one in charge.
You know what this place is?
Of course I do. That's why I'm here.
Then you understand how this must look to us.
This is important to you?
- How long have I been out?
- Three days.
Give me the phone.
Just give me the phone.
Give me the God damn phone!
Give me the phone!
As soon as you answer my question.
Call it.
Call the number, they'll tell you who I am. Call it.
Gerry?
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
- My God.
We thought you were dead.
Gerry, where are you?
Thierry, I'm with a couple of nervous gentlemen.
They need some bona fides before I can speak with you.
Of course.
This is Thierry Umutoni.
Deputy Secretary-General.
United Nations.
To whom am I speaking?
Where's Karin?
Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?
I'm sorry, Gerry.
I did what I could.
What does that mean?
You've got to calm down.
No, stop! Stop.
You're going to hurt yourself.
You're okay.
His family has been sent to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.
I'm sure they'll be safe.
Are you? Thierry told you who I am and what I used to do, right?
Yeah.
Then trust me when
I tell you they're not safe.
I understand how you feel.
- Do you? Yes?
- Yes.
Do you have a family?
- No.
- No.
Then you couldn't possibly understand, could you?
I lost my son and wife in Rome.
Rather, I lost my son to something that had once been my wife.
We have all lost someone, Mr. Lane.
In your case, there is hope at least.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Now, why did you come here?
What do you need from us?
Your worst disease.
He wants a what?
Deadly pathogen.
With a high mortality rate.
- But curable.
- Okay, well...
You'd want a bacteria rather than a virus,
I would think. Typhus?
Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.
Rocky Mountain Fever.
Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?
Mr. Lane believes we can use such a disease against the undead.
I would give you points for originality, Mr. Lane, if we hadn't already tried that, first thing.
One of the many things a virus or bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.
A functioning circulatory system.
I'm afraid it boils down to one simple fact...
You can't make a dead person sick.
It's not for them.
It's for us.
I believe these things have a weakness.
And that weakness is weakness.
- Our weakness.
I have witnessed them literally bypass people.
Walk right around them like a river around a rock. Why?
I think, because those people were sick.
I think they were terminal.
And these things could sense it.
I think they're spreading a pathogen, and they need a healthy host.
But even if you're right, I mean, infecting the populace with a lethal illness is not exactly a cure.
It's not a cure. It's camouflage.
It's camouflage.
There's a natural precedent.
Hungry predators will avoid diseased bodies.
Equipped with the right pathogen, our troops would be essentially invisible to the enemy.
You understand the only way to prove this theory of yours is for some idiot to infect themselves with a lethal pathogen and then...
...meet with her, face to face.
Yes.
Do we have what we need to try it?
We have all he could want.
Typhus, H1N1, SARS.
The problem is, they're all stored in B-Wing.
What's the matter with B-Wing?
Dr. Spellman.
Our chief vaccinologist.
Within hours of the outbreak, he'd been sent blood samples to try and isolate the pathogenic cause.
Unfortunately...
This is B-Wing now.
God damn it.
How many?
How many are there?
There were 80 people working there.
I've never seen them move like that.
They're dormant.
They're awaiting stimulus.
Now, this is vault 139.
That's where your samples would be.
This is the skybridge.
That connects B-Wing to the main building here.
And this, is the only thing standing between us and the skybridge.
So, what do you propose, Mr. Lane?
You are not serious.
B-Wing's a maze.
They'll never make it back alone.
We don't even know if his theory is correct.
Well, I know I'm not asking one of you to take him there.
Each has its merits.
- Last resort.
- It's too loud.
Let's go.
Try not to kill one.
It only makes the rest of them more aggressive.
Yeah.
You sure you want to do this?
Of course I'm not. Let's go.
Good luck.
See you all shortly.
Good luck.
If anything comes down this hall before we do, you seal these doors for good.
Understood?
- Okay.
There they are.
Go, go.
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Come on!
They're fine. They're fine.
Shit.
The vault we need is in 139.
Go!
Oh, my God.
Left, left, left!
What are you doing?
She'll get you to the vault.
That's the vault.
- We can make it.
- No, we can't.
We can't make it. Let's go!
They're not gonna make it.
You heard what Javi said, we cannot open it.
They're not alone, we can't open it!
They are coming back!
We can't leave them there.
Come on!
Open the door!
- Run!
- Run!
Run! Faster, come on!
Run!
In, in, in!
Come on!
Now where is Gerry?
Where is he, where is he, where is he?
Come on, come on, where are you?
5-6-9-6-4.
What happened to Gerry?
Not that one. Not that one.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Jesus.
He's going to inject himself.
We have no idea which one's going to work.
We don't know if any of them will work.
If he uses anything he took from that left case, he's dead anyway.
What's he doing?
How long does he have to wait?
Before he's infected? Not long, but, that's not the question we're really asking, is it?
Look at them.
He just walked right past him!
He walked right past him!
- Like it was nobody!
Okay.
This isn't the end.
Not even close.
Hi, there. This is...
This is Amy. Is anyone out there?
Hello. I'm trying to get in contact with anyone.
We've had some luck finding people with this transmission.
We've lost entire cities.
When there's no more people left to infect,
they go dormant. Whole cities are lost.
The World Health Organization
reports today that help may soon...
...a hybridized meningitis strain
with components of smallpox and H1N1.
We still don't know how it started.
The World Health
Organization has created
a vaccine that works as a kind of camouflage,
making people who receive it invisible to the infected.
We bought ourselves some time.
Volunteer forces are delivering the vaccine
to areas that have been cordoned off.
Distribution efforts began in earnest on April 10th...
The importance of getting the information
out to those still alive within the quarantine...
But it's given us a chance.
If you can get to a colder area,
to higher ground, they move slower on the ground.
The Battle of Moscow is still raging.
Initial tests on the so-called camouflage
have been largely successful.
Others have found a way to push back.
Move, move!
All right, juice 'em up!
Approaching target.
Permission to engage.
Permission granted.
All clear.
Light 'em up. Light 'em up.
It's permanent!
It's settled, it's settled! It's over with!
There's no forgiveness in hell!
Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell!
This is Station 7 in Nebraska,
broadcasting on the shortwave band.
If you can fight, fight.
Head north if you can.
Hello?
Is there anyone out there hearing this?
Help each other.
Mexico City has been declared a complete loss.
Be prepared for anything.
Our war has just begun.
You gotta be kidding me.
I can't take you.
Well, how many times have I taken you to the airport?
Matt has a soccer game tomorrow.
I have a report I have to finish.
It'll only take an hour.
Fine. I'll call a cab.
Oh, come on, Kyle.
[Text message tone]
[Sent tone]
Kyle, I'm running out!
[Car lock beep]
Uhh!
[Tires squealing]
Come on, Rossi.
I don't want to use them.
I don't even understand you.
It's a vacation, Rossi.
Everyone likes vacation.
Vacations are overrated.
Didn't you take a vacation two years ago?
Luckily, two days in
I was called back.
Garcia: Yeah, and now he's got 31 days.
A month?
You know, sunshine is an essential source of vitamin D.
You should go to Florida and get some sunshine.
That's for old guys.
What about a safari in Africa?
Too hot.
Reid: How about Italy?
Too many relatives.
You sound hermetic.
No, Rossi just likes his wine and stogies.
And I go crazy if I have nothing to do.
You know, Rossi, if you don't use 'em, you lose 'em.
Thank you. This is what
I've been telling him.
See this? This is my
"I don't care" face.
That's your normal face.
If I were you, I'd give your vacation days away to a colleague in need.
[Snaps fingers]
Garcia, see how many people in the Bureau have spouses in the military serving overseas.
I am on it.
Altruism is sexy.
Yes, it is.
Yes, sir.
Let's get started.
All right, crime-fighters, last night, two victims,
Brenda Wipley and Mark Coleman were found murdered hours apart, one in San Diego, one in Los Angeles.
They were blitz-attacked and they were chained to a car where they were dragged alive to their deaths.
And the local P.D. does not believe the victims knew each other.
And both received similar text messages last night from prepaid phones asking them to meet.
So our unsub's a friend or at least pretends to be one.
Based on how they were killed, he wanted to see them suffer.
Morgan: He's sadistic.
Mm-hmm. And mission oriented.
Dragging's usually associated with hate crimes, but neither victim was a minority nor gay.
Actually, dragging is steeped in English history.
Back in the 11th Century, drawing and quartering was a common form of punishment, and in fact, they would also disembowel and behead the victims when they were done with them.
But that didn't happen here.
Maybe this is just a serial killer who crosses city lines.
I don't know. Two victims in 3 hours?
That's a spree.
Our unsub may claim another victim soon.
Which is why we're headed west.
We'll land in Orange County, half of us will go to San Diego, the other half L.A.
Wheels up in 30.
Uhh!
Wait. Wait. Come back!
What did I do to?!
Please don't do this!
No!
Oh, no, no!

Rossi: Ralph Steadman wrote,
"evil is always devising more corrosive misery through man's restless need to exact revenge out of his hate."
All right, let's go to victimology.
Neither of the victims was sexually assaulted or robbed.
Well, Brenda was a teacher and a mother of two.
She went to meet a friend that night.
Mm-hmm. And her husband backs the story.
And the other victim,
Mark Coleman, was an addict.
He was killed in the parking lot of a drugstore around the corner from the sober living house.
A woman with no apparent addiction and a tweaker in a sober living house?
They probably don't know each other.
Garcia, did the unsub call the victims on the disposable cells prior to that night?
Let's see. In the last few weeks, he called each of the victims over two times a day.
That's not random.
It's hunting.
Without phone transcripts, it's going to be hard to understand what the unsub's ruse was.
Well, it ended pretty bad.
Tying someone to the back of a car is horrific and uncharacteristically high-risk behavior.
It was pure torture. Skin was scraped off, bones were broken.
That's about desecrating the body.
Well, our unsub is comfortable using chains and hitching equipment.
You know, the crimes could have been committed to promote fear.
All right, just-- can we rewind for a second?
Is it possible to kill someone in San Diego and then drive 2 1/2 hours up to L.A.
And then do it again?
If you drove a V8 engine with a single plane crankshaft
80 miles per hour in good traffic, you took the I-5 to the 405 to the 10 east, got off on La Cienega, went right on Washington, north on Vermont, and then snuck up Selma using the back alley, you could do it in an hour, 42 minutes, and still have time for tacos.
Wow.
Yeah.
JJ, you and Morgan go to the latest crime scene.
Dave, you and Blake to San Diego to the medical examiner's, and Reid and I will go to the LAPD.
[Indistinct chatter and police radio]
Officer: You gotta keep the barricades back.
JJ.
The blood trail ends about 3 blocks away where the body was found.
This is where he was tied to the car.
What's up with the drugstore?
It was closed Friday. They're in the middle of a remodel.
That's convenient.
Yes. So is the fact that the camera's not working.
So the unsub drags Mark over here, then blitz attacks him from behind.
Ok, if the killer knew the drugstore was closed and the cameras weren't working, he wasn't expecting anyone here.
And he scoped out the nearby streets.
He knew there'd be low traffic, so he could drag the victims without being caught.
What if Mark was falling off the wagon and he was meeting his dealer?
Right? Like the first victim also met the unsub in a parking lot.
Maybe she had a drug habit, too.
It's possible.
But either way, our unsub is highly organized.
[Cell phone rings]
Hello?
Oh, hi.
I can't do it today.
I know.
I'm really sorry.
Next week.
Promise.
[Text message tone]
Me, too.
Name the place.
Officer: The desk sergeant.
[Indistinct chatter]
Hi, I'm Detective Pratt.
You must be SSA Hotchner.
I am. This is
Dr. Spencer Reid.
Pleasure.
Well, I talked to San Diego PD.
They sent over everything on the first victim Brenda Wipley's case.
And Mr. Coleman's updated file's on the conference room table.
I'll start looking them over.
Now, should we notify the press that we're looking for a spree killer?
Not until we know exactly what we're looking for.
Ok. You guys can set up right in here.
[Text message tone]
Thank you.
Morgan and JJ think that maybe our second victim Mark went to meet a drug dealer.
Have you gotten the tox screens back?
Neither of the victims had drugs in their system.
It doesn't mean they didn't go meet a dealer.
But a drug dealer doesn't call you twice a day for two weeks.
Usually you call him.
[Cell phone rings]
Go ahead, Garcia.
The path of my cyber sleuthing has had majestic results.
Digging into victim number two's past, it turns out meth isn't the only thing
Mark Coleman had done.
He also changed his last name.
From what?
Logan. And that's where the plot thickens like a bad pudding.
So when Mark was a junior in college, he gets picked up by police on a drug charge.
They find some articles of clothing of a missing 8-year-old girl named Kelly Taylor in his car.
They are covered with Mark's DNA.
After a lengthy interrogation, he confesses to sexually assaulting her, but denies killing her, and because her body was never found, they couldn't link him to the disappearance.
What's he been doing since he got out?
Eating hamburgers.
He got released a month ago.
Since then he's worked at 3 different fast food joints.
Send me everything you've got on the case.
I'll have Reid go talk to the family.
Yeah.
Outside.
I was having my soup.
Now.
Thanks. Garcia was only able to give away
25 of my vacation days to employees with loved ones in Afghanistan.
Well, great. Now you just have to figure out what to do with the remaining 6.
Hey. I'm Dr. Mathis.
I heard it took the L.A. M.E. 4 hours to find the second victim's entire body.
Yeah, he was spread all over the place.
Well, victim one had it easy by comparison.
She was dragged postmortem.
We thought she was alive at first.
No. She died from a series of blows to the head.
So the unsub was scared on his first kill, then two hours later when he got his second victim, his confidence suddenly evolved.
That's a pretty quick evolution.
And therein lies the problem.
So I talked to victim number two's father.
He said as far as he knew, no one was trying to get back at Mark for the rape.
He got out of jail last month.
He was getting out more, exercising, trying to get on with his life.
Well, I just compared photos from the first and second crime scenes.
The cars used to drag were different.
Maybe the killer switched cars?
Or we're looking at two unsubs.
What did you and Morgan find?
Well, at both crime scenes, the nearby stores were either closed or being remodeled, so the killer would have had to scope the area, lure and drag the victim without being caught.
This guy has a lot to do.
So the question remains, how can you do that twice in one night in cities over
100 miles apart?
Two unsubs would explain the evolution in M.O.
What did Rossi and Blake say?
The first victim Brenda was dragged postmortem.
The second victim was alive.
So we're most likely looking at one unsub who's hesitant and another one who actually enjoys it.
What do you mean, you killed her first?
I just couldn't do it while she was still alive.
But that's the whole point.
Come on, you know what she did.
I know. But she was begging for her life and I just couldn't hear it anymore.
Oh, you should have called me.
You had your own thing to do.
Ok, we've been planning this thing for 6 months.
If you thought you were gonna chicken out, you should have told me at last week's meeting.
Ok, we're done now, so let's just go home and pretend this never happened.
No. We're not going anywhere.
When I killed Mark, he told me there were two other guys that helped.
What?
He didn't do this alone?
So what are we gonna do now?
We're gonna kill them.
That is what we're gonna do.
I can't do this again!
Yes. Yes.
Yes, Darlene, you can.
I don't know...
Darlene, if we don't do this, who else will?
We know most teams work together, two unsubs versus one victim.
Here we have a team that's 120 miles apart using similar M.O.s on radically different victims.
JJ: Ok, so how do we think they met?
Blake: Something in the victimology should tell us.
Morgan: Well, we know that victim number two, Mark Coleman, has a sketchy background.
What if victim number one was hiding something as well?
Let's start digging.
Who the hell are you?
You thought you could rape and kill an 8-year-old and get away with it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah. That's not what Mark said!
Ok. Ok. I was there, but I didn't do anything.
Shut up!
I thought if I tried to stop them, they'd hurt me.
Imagine how Kelly felt.
What are you doing?
Let's just kill him now.
No, that's too easy.
Now get in the car.
You don't need to do this!
Karma's a bitch, isn't it?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything!
No!
Help!
Come on!
No, no, I didn't do anything!
Help! Please help!
I didn't do anything! Help!
What did you find?
Paul Montgomery was alive when he was dragged.
And it turns out Paul worked the late shift nearby.
My officers found blood around his vehicle.
He was probably blitz attacked when he left work.
Did we find his cell?
Yeah, it was on the ground.
But he had no text messages or prior calls.
That's a change in M.O.
Usually they lure their victims out.
[Cell phone rings] What happened to their organization?
[Ring]
Garcia, what did you find out about Paul Montgomery?
So guess who were BFFs in college.
Hmm. Mark Coleman and Paul?
10 points to Blakendore.
Turns out Paul was a character witness in Mark Coleman's rape trial.
He waxed poet about his boy.
The jury didn't care.
So we have two scumbags and an innocent mom as victims.
Anything in Brenda Wipley's past?
No, not that I've found yet.
She went to college at UCLA, she went to high school in Orange County.
Does she have a sealed juvie record?
Why didn't I think of that?
See, this is why you're the boss man and I'm the minion who types things.
Uh, it turns out Brenda was not as coifed as her bob.
When she was 17, she was involved in a DUI that resulted in the death of a 2-year-old boy, Sam Dolan.
Did she serve time?
Yeah, she was sentenced to a year in juvie.
It was reduced to two months after her father gave hefty chunks of change to some political organizations.
So, we're definitely looking at a vigilante team avenging the death of these two kids.
We should talk to the parents of the original victims.
I'll bet they're the connection to these unsubs. Thanks, Garcia.
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Dolan.
That was taken at his second birthday.
His mom sent one to everyone.
I know this is hard, but I need to ask you some questions about the death of the woman who killed your son.
Like I told the cops,
I was returning home from London the night Brenda was murdered.
I have my boarding pass.
Ok. Now, what about your wife?
Where was she?
She killed herself a few years ago.
Uh...
I am so sorry to hear that.
She said she was getting better, and-- but ever since
Sam's death, she was a mess.
Do you think the lenient sentence was a contributing factor in her death?
Absolutely.
She thought the system failed us.
She wouldn't leave the house after that.
She even did therapy over the phone.
Did she have friends over?
No.
She spent all her time on the Internet.
Really?
Did she join any online support groups?
How'd you know?
She said it was making her better.
But I--I thought it was making her worse.
Why?
Because it allowed her to obsess about it.
And look where that got her.
Oh, no.
[Vomiting]
Not again.
I can't do this.
I thought it was gonna help, but it isn't.
That's because you're not letting it.
But it's wrong.
An eye for an eye?
It's biblical.
When I wake up in the morning,
I see Kelly's face.
When I close my eyes, she's still there.
I don't know how much longer
I can go on like this.
Don't. Don't you say that.
But that's how I feel.
You should feel rejuvenated.
Come here. Come on.
Come on.
Look.
Look at you.
They did this.
They did this to you.
So don't tell me they don't deserve what's coming to them.
Order's up.
Thanks.
Just finished my interview.
Sam Dolan's father checks out.
His mother committed suicide a few years ago.
What about Kelly's parents?
We've left them messages, but...
You might send an officer to their house and places of employment.
We should also check at the support group
Sam's mother belonged to.
Morgan:
Well, we got something.
The calls the unsub made to the victims-- twice a day at night.
That shows incredible persistence.
The first victim, Brenda, was a happily married teacher, so why would she take calls from a random man late at night?
If she was cheating, she wouldn't meet someone at a restaurant near her house.
I think she was meeting a woman.
The roommate said the second victim,
Mark, in a sober living house said that he was talking to someone online a lot lately.
The night he got killed, he got dressed up like he was going out on a date.
And he's straight, which further confirms it was a female.
That would explain the blitz attacks.
They weren't because our unsubs were insecure men, they were because our unsubs are women, who needed to subdue their victims first.
We need to give the profile.
We believe that these unsubs are two women who are killing people convicted of heinous crimes.
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
He'll be out in 10 years.
Unlike solo vigilantes, they're working in concert and they're planning and executing coordinated attacks.
Their mentality is like a lynch mob.
They believe the justice system has gone wrong and it's up to them to set it right.
Due to the pre-planning and level of commitment, we believe our unsubs are over 30.
And they probably learned about the crimes they're avenging through the media.
It's possible they were involved in these losses personally and now feel they need to act.
No! I don't accept it!
My baby's life was worth more than 10 years!
This latest attack felt more improvised and personal.
They didn't lure their victim.
Rather, they blitz attacked him outside of his job.
Now, during a spree, the threat is that an unsub will either strike again or disappear.
Now, if they've completed their vendetta, then the latter is more likely.
Our unsubs may not have prior criminal histories, as they see themselves as do-gooders.
Based on the fact that one victim was dragged postmortem and the other were dragged alive, we believe that one woman is not as confident in the mission while the other is more domineering.
We're looking for mothers, relatives, friends who have lost children.
We also need to look at the collateral damage of the crimes our current victims committed years ago.
Since this is the only thing our unsubs have in common, it tell us that as time goes on, their friendship will become strained and ultimately fall apart.
Hotch: So how do these unsubs meet?
Maybe they're involved in the trials.
In two different cities?
I don't know.
If Sam Dolan's mom was in an online support group, maybe after she killed herself, someone else became obsessed with her grief.
Yeah, but who'd have that same level of interest?
Let me call Garcia.
[Ring, beep]
- Hey, Garcia.
- At your service.
Were you able to find out anything about that online support group Mrs. Dolan was in?
Uh, let me see.
Uh, uh, uh, it had 200 members.
It was an anonymous group.
Did any of them start talking about Sam Dolan about two months ago, after his mother's suicide?
Ok, uh, I've got a screen name, Ellen R.
From San Diego. She talked about
Sam in a private chat room.
Did Sam Dolan's mom have any friends or relatives with that name?
Yeah, she's got a sister
Ellen Russel.
She works in a boat shop.
And that'd give her access to hitching equipment.
Who was she interacting with in the support group?
She talked to a lot of people.
In the last year, she was mainly talking to a Darlene B.
Kelly Taylor's mom's name is Darlene.
What's her maiden name?
Beckett. In the last
6 months, most of their discussions have been around the pending release of Mark Coleman from prison.
And they probably hatched a plan.
We need to get search warrants for Ellen's and Darlene's houses.
Oh, my gosh! This just in.
So when Mark was released a month ago, her and Ellen started calling him, posing as a friend.
That would explain the disposable cell phones.
That's the trigger.
Mark's release set them off.
Yeah, right, great.
So Ellen was still mad because there was no justice served for her nephew's death, and...her and Darlene must have agreed to swap revenge killings.
And they'd avoid getting caught.
It's like
"Strangers on a Train."
Yeah, but this ain't
Hitchcock, folks.
Why kill Paul? He was just a character witness for Mark.
A character witness who traveled 300 miles once a week to see his friend in prison.
Friends usually distance themselves from rapists and murderers.
Unless you're involved.
Garcia, you and JJ look into Kelly's disappearance.
We need to find out how these unsubs got to Paul and anybody else who might have been involved in the case.
All right, I'll let him know.
Ok. Got it.
My officers just interviewed
Darlene's ex-husband.
He says she hasn't been the same since Kelly disappeared.
She's been suffering from chronic depression.
The loss of a child either brings you together or breaks you apart.
The day she disappeared,
Kelly left school early because she and her mother were going on vacation, but she never made it home.
They found her underwear in Mark's car, which led to his confession.
I got the lab results back from Kelly's rape.
It turns out there was a second
DNA sample on her underwear, but it's too degraded to make a match.
Maybe the women suspected it was Paul's.
San Diego PD just searched
Ellen's house.
She's not there, but they put an officer out front just in case she comes back.
So we need to figure out who Paul was to Mark in college.
They ran cross-country, sometimes participating in a relay together.
It means they were close.
Don't 4 people do relays?
[Beep]
Hey, baby girl.
Hey.
Listen, we need to figure out who ran in the cross-country relay with Paul Montgomery and Mark Coleman.
Bryce Phillips and Jason Nelson.
They look inseparable.
And where are they now?
Bryce lives in Amsterdam,
Jason in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles.
And what was Jason's relationship with Mark like when he went to jail?
Jason was at the hearing and he visited Mark once a week in prison, so, close?
He probably participated in the crime.
And our killing duo found out about it.
That would explain the change in M.O.
Maybe Mark gave a dying declaration and gave up his boys.
Maybe our ladies are improvising, which explains killing
Paul outside his job.
We need to get to Jason's house before they do.
[TV plays]
[Glass breaking]
[Turns TV off]
Today's your lucky day, Jason.
Who are you?
Kelly's mom.
You remember Kelly, don't you?
Oh--I can explain.
I can explain.
Too late.
I'll do anything you want. Ok?
I could take you to her body.
Her body?
You know where my baby is?
Yeah, yeah.
I can take you there.
If I do that, you'll let me go, right?
[Sirens]
Clear.
Guys, there's broken glass over here.
And blood on the floor.
Morgan! JJ!
Search the bedrooms.
Blake, check outside, see if Jason was dragged.
I am serious. I am not--
I'm not the same guy that I used to be.
Shut up!
I think about what I did to her every day.
Which way?
I--right.
I--I--I have a girlfriend now, and I have a good job.
I've changed.
Change is crap.
Ok? People just become more of who they are.
You don't know me.
Tell me what you did to my daughter that day.
Darlene...
Where did you take her?
Don't answer that.
I have the right to know.
It's complicated.
She was 8 years old.
You tell me what you did to her!
He was into improving himself.
"Let's do healthy relationships."
Go figure.
Guy seems in love.
Ok.
Um...
Uh...it was, uh...
It was hot that day.
We were all just sitting around getting high, and then out of the blue,
Mark asked if, uh, if any one of us had ever been with a... with a little girl.
I mean, of course we said--we said no, but then someone said... that we should go and get one.
And the next thing we know, we were out on the corner.
We're waiting and...
I--I-- we were just about to leave...
When your daughter walked by.
And so you thought, we'll just snatch this little black girl.
Hey. It had nothing to do with race.
My best friend is black.
It's just...
Oh...
Oh, Kelly, she was just--she was so pretty. Oh--
That's enough!
Oh, we just lit up. Oh....
Mommy should have been on time.
[Sobbing]
Son of a bitch!
Aah!
Come on.
What are you doing?
Oh, you think this is funny?
Ohh!
I have been dying to tell that story for so long.
Aah!
Stop it! Stop it!
- Are you serious?
- I need to find her.
I need to bring her back home.
She is dead!
And we are killing this guy.
No, I can't! I have got to bring her back home.
[Groans] Ellen, closure is important to a mom.
And, uh...
[Coughs, groans]
Whoo! Ahh.
Besides, to protect myself,
I told a neighbor to write down the license plate of any strange car that came by.
So... you were expecting us?
Well, I knew you found the first two.
I assumed I'd be next.
Ucch. Why are men so messy?
I don't get down like this.
I'm a clean freak.
Why does that not surprise me?
Something's just... off about this guy.
Gut feeling?
Deep gut.
Jennifer Jareau, your gut knows what it's talking about.
So nothing about Jason Nelson seems out of the ordinary?
He seems as all-American as apple pie.
No reports of any bodies found.
Maybe they haven't killed him yet.
We'll keep you posted.
This guy might give these ladies a run for their money.
Morgan: Trophies.
Kelly wasn't the only girl.
This is all a facade.
Jason's a psychopath.
A psychopath versus two vigilantes.
I have a feeling this is not going to end well.
Is this it?
Is this where you put Kelly?
Uh...hmm...
No.
What do you mean?
You said this was where she is.
Well, I will take you there if you do something for me.
No! This is not a negotiation.
No. It's a bribe.
What do you want?
Kill someone.
Anyone.
And then I'll tell you where it is.
You want us to just kill some random person?
That's what I said.
I want you to know how good I felt.
That's disgusting!
We're not murderers.
Oh, really?
That's not what it looks like from here.
And besides, if you don't do it, my neighbor will drop a dime on you, remember?
You didn't tell your neighbor.
You'll never know.
Darlene, do you want to find your daughter or not?
Not like this.
You don't have a choice, ladies.
Yeah, we do!
Darlene, just do it.
I can't!
Damn it!
Ohh!
Pow! Boom!
Noo!
Awesome!
Oh, no, no, no!
Now you take us to her daughter.
Or you're next.
Ohh.
The victim says he was shot by a white woman.
She was with a black woman and a white guy.
These women have been so specific about their victims up until this point, why shoot a random person?
Jason's a psychopath.
Maybe he made them do it.
He could be holding them hostage.
Or he's got something that's keeping him alive.
A bargaining chip?
Maybe he knows where Kelly's body's buried.
But Ellen did the shooting, not Darlene.
Ellen tortured the second victim.
And she's helping Darlene kill the rest of Kelly's assailants, when she could have just walked away.
So this woman is a psychopath, too.
Then Jason's made a love connection.
And he'll probably try to manipulate Ellen to do something worse.
We lost these women a long time ago.
Blake, turn Jason's place upside down.
We need to find where they may have put Kelly's body.
Ellen, why?!
Now, why did you go and do that?!
We have come too far.
Bull. She liked it.
No, she didn't.
Tell him you didn't like that.
Oh, oh, you know, if we were smart, Ellen, we'd partner up.
Shut up!
We could drive across the country just killing people.
I'd get my little girls, and you can get, you know, whoever you wanted.
That's enough!
Wouldn't it be great...
To live in a world where no one judged you?
I wouldn't judge you, baby.
I would have your back.
Come on.
Come on, what do you say?
If we are not at that body in the next 20 minutes,
I'm gonna take that gun and shove it so far down your throat, you're gonna wish you were dead.
Yeah, yeah... just make a left.
This is getting exciting.
Hmm...
Hmm hmm hmm, let's see.
I think it was over here to the right.
You think or you know?
I know. I just moved it.
Why would you do that?
When Mark died,
I needed to cover my tracks.
Uh...oh. Oh. Oh.
It's right here.
I remember.
Right...here.
Start digging.
The landlord says this is
Jason's storage closet.
It looks like my storage unit.
My husband has so much crap, it's not funny.
Is it hard being in a relationship with someone overseas?
We make it work.
Working for Doctors Without Borders is a very noble cause.
I would imagine you guys have an epistolary novel by now, though.
We stick to Skype.
It's modern.
When we're together, it's like we're dating, and when we're not,
I get stuff done.
Look at this.
Fresh loam soil.
Usually found near plains and streams.
Either he was just camping...
Or used it to move the body.
Jason finds out his friends are killed, he might take precautions.
What is taking so long?
I'm almost there.
Hurry up!
[Thud]
Oh...
[Thud]
Oh. Oh...
There it is.
That's just a skull.
Where's the rest of my daughter?
We have a few more holes to dig.
You cut up my baby?
That was my idea, too.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
[Laughing]
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
[Screaming]
There's loam soil surrounding some Southern California beaches and also loam soil around some parks in the area.
What areas are near running trails?
Uh, there is a trail in the Hollywood Hills area that is lousy with loam soil.
And I'm sending Morgan and Rossi to the location now.
Over here.
They got him.
We've got officers at Ellen and Darlene's homes just in case they come back.
And have them check the airports, bus stations, train stations, everything.
I'll also put an APB out along the coast.
Garcia cross-checked the trophies we found at Jason's, and they match articles from 3 different missing children.
And have officers excavate the area around where
Jason's body was found.
There may be more bodies there.
I'm on it.
Blake:
At least we got Jason.
He could have kept killing forever.
And the women just get away.
Hmm. For now.
You ok?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Chatter, laughter]
So now what?
Well, um, we're gonna split up.
I might keep heading south.
You'd do good here.
Yeah. You're right.
I think it's better if we don't stay together.
You know what I don't get?
How this was so easy for you.
How so?
We had to kill 5 people.
Our deal was just for two.
That's not what
I'm talking about.
Does it bother you that none of this took the hurt away?
I never thought it would.
Then why did we do it?
Because somebody has to pay, ok?
I don't care what anybody says.
Actions have consequences.
Maybe not at trial.
Maybe not in jail.
Come on.
Admit it, Darlene, this gave you a reason to live.
That's what I was hoping.
But it just made me feel more... more nothing.
Then you're a wuss.
I'm gonna go get us something cold to drink.
Wait. I diss you and you care if I'm thirsty?
Huh. You gotta start thinking about yourself, honey.
That's the game.
Dollars ok?
Gracias.
Ellen Russel?
How'd you find me?
Darlene never unpacked her daughter's bags from this trip.
And I took a wild guess.
So what happens now?
What happens now is you go back to the U.S.
I take 6 days off that I don't even want.
Where's Darlene?
She's long gone.
Personally, I have mixed feelings about that one.
But we'll get her, too.
Levantese.
[Speaking spanish]
...a Los estados unidos.
Rossi: Thanks for your help.
Rossi: Paul Brown once said,
"If you win, say nothing.
If you lose, say less."

If there was only one person in the world who would make you happy, who was made for you, what would you sacrifice to find him?
How many centuries would you search for him?
And if you were to ever find him, would you let him go?
Wouldn't you hold him as tight as possible with both arms and never, ever let him go?
What did we jet to Paris for anyway?
You shouldn't have killed the pilot.
Charlotte?
Two more pages.
I want to know how it ends.
Now.
- What a shame.
- What?
It isn't your fault.
Let me guess.
Her eyes were too pretty to be true.
Don't listen to her, Louise.
You'll be lucky sometime.
Sometime.
Watch out!
Freeze!
Get down on the ground!
Get down, I said!
Hands behind your head!
Spread your legs!
Stay down!
Freeze!
Out of the way!
Let go!
Police!
Ow!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Did you see a guy run past?
This tall?
Hooded sweatshirt, dark pants.
Sorry.
What have you got?
Not a trace.
I can't believe it!
May I sit down next to you?
I have to rest a bit.
That rat was too fast for me.
What'd he do?
Who?
The rat who was too fast for you.
He ripped off a Russian pimp we were about to arrest.
Oh.
I bet he doesn't know who he ripped off, but he nearly screwed up our operation.
Tom.
Hi.
Doesn't that hurt?
It's okay.
There's broken glass everywhere.
Thanks for the warning.
It's too late.
What now?
I have to arrest you.
- If you catch me.
- If I catch you?
I got away once.
I didn't know who I was chasing.
But now I know who I'm running from.
Does it make you faster?
What kind of cop are you?
We could...
Stay here.
Stop it.
I don't want to hurt you.
Sorry, Tom.
"Insufficient funds.
Contact your bank. "
Hey, sweetheart.
You didn't tell me your probation officer is so nice.
Could I have a glass of water?
Yes, of course.
- Are you crazy?
- Fuck off, man!
Let her in.
Cold nights
Let your eyes shine
Hollow dreams
And my soul makes its demands
Fast breathing
Our bodies quiver
Gently trembling...
And my soul is burning
I'm dying of thirst.
Buy me a drink if I pay?
No, don't!
Don't.
Keep it.
As a down payment for gazing into your beautiful eyes.
Where are your friends?
What friends?
Nobody your age goes out without their clique.
I fly solo.
If you want to be different you have two choices.
You are destroyed by their world, or you create your own world.
You need money for that.
All you need is courage.
And you have both.
Enough for two.
I'd rather do my own thing.
Good luck.
You don't see it yourself.
Your eyes are blind, although they betray you with every glance.
What are you talking about?
About what's inside you.
And what is it?
Something special.
Rare.
Breathtaking.
You'd be the first human being to notice it.
I'm no human being.
Berlin. There was a tragic plane crash last night.
A plane coming from Paris crashed within city limits...
The lions first dig into the fallen prey, always a bloody but fascinating spectacle.
I was so excited about you coming that I couldn't sleep.
Nora.
Come on!
Good evening.
What did you do to me?
Sit down.
What did you do to me?
Don't.
I know what you need.
What's in there?
Your new life.
To immortality.
That's all bullshit!
You're all crazy!
Oh.
Your new trophy doesn't seem to get the picture.
You'll have to show her the proof.
If you want her to swim, throw her in the water.
- You have a girl for me?
- Yes.
- Does she have any experience?
- Not yet.
What are you doing to me?
I'll teach you something you don't want to learn.
Don't show any sympathy.
The more evil the man, the sweeter the blood.
She said you're a shy girl.
We'll take care of that.
I paid for you!
She learns fast.
We rarely treat ourselves to pimps.
Just wait.
Oh, Louise.
Pretty please.
You have two red ones that you never drive.
Let go.
Let go.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
What's all this shit?
Ohlsen, where are the stiffs?
Downstairs.
- Morning.
- Hi.
Did you tell anybody?
Where'd you get that idea?
Okay.
How many stiffs are there?
Two. A burned body here.
The second one's in the back.
They died about eight hours ago.
Is the one in the back burned too?
- Yeah.
- Who found them?
- Two young kids.
- Did you question them?
Well, I'll be damned.
Am I dead?
You won't quench your thirst with abstinence.
Well?
How does it feel?
Yes.
I know.
You have no idea what wonders await you here.
I know how you feel, Lena.
I remember my own transformation.
It was a masked ball at court.
It all happened so fast.
I hated her at first.
How could she do it to me?
But then we travelled all over Europe together.
She showed me the world and opened my eyes.
When she burned to death in Nice a century later,
I wanted to join her.
I was so desperate, so lost.
But something held me back, a longing, a hope, and I began to search again.
And now...
I've found you at last.
There's no way they could have manipulated the tapes.
Hmm.
There.
Huh?
We have a witness.
I don't get it.
Zoom in.
What's that on his ear?
Cool!
You should have given her a wedding dress.
Welcome to the family.
You look fantastic.
- Shall we?
- I don't have any shoes.
Oh, my poor little Cinderella.
Take yours.
Press.
The one with the fewest bags has to pay.
Got a favourite restaurant,
Lena?
Do we eat?
Just for fun.
We eat, drink, sniff coke, and fuck as much as we like.
But we never get fat, pregnant or hooked.
Enjoy it.
Billions of babes would kill to be in our place.
Did you see that?
It can smile.
The waiter isn't on the menu.
That was my dessert.
Enjoy it.
Doesn't satisfy my hunger, but it still tastes awesome.
Mmm! Mm!
How old are you anyway?
- Tut, tut!
- Never ask a lady's age.
If Louise hadn't found me at the Love Parade, I'd be 37.
Hey, sweetheart.
Smoking isn't permitted here.
Was that all you wanted to know?
How many of you are there?
40 women in Europe,
100 worldwide.
- And the men?
- Extinct.
They were too loud, too greedy, and too stupid.
Some were killed by humans.
We took care of the rest.
And we swore never to bite a man who had the gift.
Long live emancipation.
Yes, for over 200 years, no man, neither mortal nor immortal, has told me what to do.
No king, no boss, no husband.
What woman can make that claim?
Excuse me.
If you ever hit on me again,
I'll have you fired!
I know.
It was a bit mean.
But he's cute, isn't he?
Why do you treat him so cruelly?
I don't want to hurt him.
You just did.
I mean, really hurt him.
People fall apart so easily.
Come on!
Charlotte.
Charlotte!
You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.
I didn't mean to rush into it.
I'm sorry.
Stupid Louise.
Stupid, stupid, stupid Louise.
"Print job in a print queue. "
Good morning.
- You're early.
- Yeah.
Did you even go home?
I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
- No idea.
Afraid of missing something.
I'll give you some advice.
Find something to offset your job.
- Like a hobby?
- No, a private life.
Cuddling and smooching.
I'm working on it.
Are you going out?
I wasn't home the last two nights.
Didn't you notice?
You're old enough.
Lena?
How did you find me?
Hi.
I almost didn't recognize you.
You have a police record.
And you want to try to arrest me again?
No, I'm afraid of you.
Wait a sec.
You ripped off an asshole who pimps out little girls.
If I arrest you, you'll get 18 months probation for car theft.
And that isn't fair.
Here.
What is it? unwrap it.
I wanted to wash it, but my washing machine is broken.
I found it behind the pillar after you'd left and I could get up again.
Thanks.
You bet.
Changed your style.
- I like it.
- It's just a dress.
No, you're up to something.
You just saw me once before.
You get a feeling for it in my job.
Your hair is different.
It's no longer dyed.
You never used to wear shoes like that.
I can tell by the way you wobble.
Anything else?
Yeah.
You wouldn't have had coffee with me at our first encounter.
Will you leave me alone then?
We just got started.
For good.
I promise.
Come on.
Give it to me.
Here.
How's your hand doing?
It's healed.
- Not bad.
- I have good genes.
Why would someone like you want to be a policeman?
Someone like me?
Someone who seems to be okay.
Thank you.
It's one of the few jobs that pays for an adrenaline kick.
Racing through streets, kicking in doors and chasing crooks.
I love it.
Did you say that when you applied?
Sure.
And you?
You always wanted to be a pickpocket?
Not anymore.
That's good.
Did I say something wrong?
- I have to go.
- Really?
- Yes.
- What a shame.
Can I walk with you?
Sure.
- Everything okay?
- Yes.
You promised.
Tear it up when I'm out of sight.
Hey, Lena, why shouldn't we see each other again?
My boyfriend would make trouble.
You think I can afford clothes like these?
It's my way of getting out of this place.
You're the lousiest liar.
"There's a strange element among us. "
Had enough nightlife?
Louise would say, you'll get used to it.
She wants you to be happy here.
I became too depressed for her taste.
And now she thinks you're the one she's spent centuries looking for.
You'd better not disappoint her.
I was a very untalented actress.
I wouldn't have survived in sound films.
Louise and I met opening night.
My husband and my little daughter had already gone home.
You were beautiful.
Would you have bitten me otherwise?
Or Nora or Lena?
Oh, Charlotte, don't ruin the evening for us.
Because we're all in such a good mood.
The ladies are quite moody today.
You spoil us.
So you aren't tortured by unfulfilled wishes.
I miss the sun.
I was afraid you'd miss something that I can't give you.
- Where is he?
- In there.
- Who are you?
- Drop it!
Are you a policeman?
Drop your gun first.
Slowly.
Show me.
Put me in the most secure cell in the best prison.
Please.
Hi, boys!
Mwah!
Get out of there!
We'll press charges!
Please, don't.
Have mercy.
I won't say it again!
Get out!
Why not take off your silly uniforms and jump in with us?
- What did she say?
- We should get in the water.
We have so much room.
What do they pay you, to miss out on all this fun?
Look.
She's topless.
It's our big chance.
It won't come again.
You won't harm them, will you?
I promise.
Ladies.
- Hello, Mr. Security.
- Hello.
- What's your name?
- I'm Bernd.
Bernd.
- What do you do up there?
- I keep watch.
- It's completely normal.
- Really?
Yes, by all means.
Absolutely normal.
Will you tell me your name?
Guess.
Chantal.
Mm-mm.
Mandy?
Babette, Nicole,
Steffi,
Isabel.
Where's my partner?
Did he leave already?
Do you know where my partner went?
Nora!
"For Whom The Bell Tolls"
Charlotte!
No, Charlotte!
Charlotte!
Stop overreacting, and accept who you are.
Nora!
- Why did you do that?
- Why not?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
Oh, please!
We need an ambulance!
Mm-hmm.
- Yes?
- Yes.
No, no, no!
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Tom Serner here.
Leave a message after the beep.
Hello, Tom.
It's me, Lena.
I...
I didn't know who to call.
I...
They're dangerous...
What illegal substances do you consume?
- Who? Me?
- Yes. Drugs!
Drugs?
No!
Why did you burn your partners?
In German, please.
I told you everything.
I didn't kill anyone.
It was the women with devil's eyes, and they run on the ceiling.
Ah, they have wings, huh?
You mean they can fly?
Why did they steal my Lamborghini?
What?
My Lamborghini!
Very expensive!
- What colour?
- Silver.
Silver like cross.
Where did you find the Lamborghini?
At the Grand Hotel?
- No, let the SWAT team wait!
- SWAT?
Not my decision.
Hello, Tom. It's me, Lena.
I didn't know who to call.
What's up?
Got a girlfriend?
Wake up, my Romeo.
No.
No!
What did you do?
Shh.
The police are storming the hotel!
I'll stop them.
Position your people at all exits.
Yes, immediately!
- Which floor?
- The fourth.
How did they find us?
We'll take the safe cars.
Don't move!
Charlotte!
Get in,
Charlotte!
- Where is Nora?
- Behind me.
Shit!
- Stop!
- What for?
Stop!
We have to help her!
Fire!
She won't make it!
Go!
- Charlotte!
- No!
Be reasonable!
Don't leave me alone!
Nora!
Come on!
Gone.
Come on.
Hurry.
Freeze!
It's all over!
Please, Lena.
Don't hurt him!
We're heading toward the light.
Get out!
What a crazy day.
Who was that policeman?
I saw you together once.
I have no idea what you mean.
How does he know you?
He wanted to arrest me for a trifle.
For a trifle?
Nora burned to death for a trifle.
We're on the run for a trifle!
And you led them to us!
That's wrong!
I didn't tell him.
How did he find us?
You kill people every night!
Do you think nobody notices?
She's right, Louise.
We were never good at cleaning up.
- Are you on her side?
- I'm on nobody's side.
Just calm down.
Of course.
Of course.
We need money and new passports.
I want to say good-bye before we leave town.
It smells like death here.
When was the last time that Charlotte saw her?
She's asleep.
Maybe it's better this way.
Mommy.
Come on.
Come on.
It's time.
The next sunrise we'll see is in Moscow.
Charlotte.
No!
Charlotte!
No!
I'm sorry.
Open the door!
Don't do this!
Open the door!
Charlotte!
No!
Open the door!
Charlotte!
Charlotte
I wanted to see you before I go.
Who are you?
I can't explain it in words.
Stay there!
Let go.
- Stop it.
- Look right at me.
Let go!
No, damn it!
Lena!
Look right at it.
- An ambulance.
- No, look at it.
Just shut up.
No!
Lena, no!
Come on!
Sorry, I had to do it.
I'm sorry too.
Fucker!
Good evening.
How do you picture your future, Lena?
Even if he stayed with you, which I doubt, he'd only have 60 years at most.
And then...
Then you'd be alone.
And then your loneliness will devour you bit by bit.
Believe me.
I know what I'm talking about.
Be quiet.
No.
Lena, run away!
Louise, don't hurt him!
Please!
I'll give him his life, under one condition.
Tell me you love me.
So that I believe you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you, Louise.
I love you.
The loveliest lie
I've ever heard.
No!
No!
Now we're the only ones left.
Headquarters?
I'll call for a manhunt.
I'll do it.
Headquarters.
Come in, please.
Okay, call in forensics.
Headquarters.
Come in.
Good luck.
There's one word to describe what's happening and that word is "panic."
And of course this comes with unthinkable irrational behavior.
The crash of '29, 1987's Black Monday,
came with tragic suicides and murders.
This collapse is no exception.
Just one hour ago, as the markets were opening,
two partners at
Capt Villiers Holdings
were shot at the troubled company's headquarters.
Senior partner Laura
Mailer died on site
and analyst Albert Bernad is in critical condition.
Jeffrey Desange, also senior partner,
was in the office at the time of the shooting and has now gone missing.
Victoria... We...
We gotta go, sweetheart.
That's it.
Isn't Mommy taking me to school?
Mommy's not feeling well.
Put on your glasses.
Come on. Let's go.
Daddy, where are we going?
I don't know.
Fuck!
You're driving too fast!
Daddy, you're driving too...
Shut up!
Sorry, excuse me.
Whoa! Hey, buddy, you wanna get behind the tape?
I'm family.
Lucas Desange.
You called me, someone called me, a detective or something.
You live here?
No, no, my brother lives here.
What's going on? Where's Jeff?
Are the girls okay?
Where are the girls?
Sir, just hang on, all right?
Just wait here.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
...Jeffrey Desange apparently shot two business partners to death
before going onto murder his estranged wife
and kidnap his two daughters aged three and one.
It's okay.
It's okay, come on.
Daddy, are we there yet?
My glasses are broken.
What is it?
This is okay. Yeah.
Victoria, come here.
There's someone inside.
Now!
Come on, come on.
Daddy!
There's a woman outside.
She's not touching the floor.
Why are you crying?
'Cause I'm sad, honey.
Why are you sad?
You know, moms and dads, they try real hard, but sometimes they mess things up.
You know Daddy loves you, right?
Uh-huh.
I can't see.
What's that?
Look, honey, a deer.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy? Daddy?
Look, Lilly, a cherry.
Burnsie!
So where are you guys today?
Well, we're gonna have another look around Sector 1-7-12-33.
That's the mountain road, right?
Uh-huh.
Gas station... Go up through the
Wilson Pass... It sounds good.
Oh, God, I hate to do this.
Do what?
Your last payment didn't clear.
Well... I'll check on that. Don't worry about it. The bank's screwing up.
All right, I'll look into it and get back to you.
Thanks. Bye.
Thank you, God. Sweet!
That Burnsie on the phone?
Yup.
What's his next move? Is he going to search sector plural-Z-alpha?
Hey, guess who's not pregnant?
What is wrong with you?
The last payment didn't clear.
So there's a problem with the bank or...
The money's gone.
I pick "B".
That is the correct answer.
Hey, look, babe.
It's your brother.
You wanna spend all your money trying to find him, it's okay with me.
It's cheaper than therapy.
And so am I.
Whoa!
I need to go.
Mmm-hmm.
Burnsie!
What?
Hey, Burnsie!
Jesus Christ!
We gonna call him?
Just give me a minute.
Well, we should call!
We said we'd call.
Ronnie, shut up just for one minute.
Here you go,
Bird, take a whiff of that.
Hello!
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir.
It's cherry pits.
Hey, Burnsie!
Burnsie, can we call him now?
They found them.
You're shitting me.
They found the girls, alive.
Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss, and you must be Annabel.
I must be.
Lucas.
How are they?
Well, just let me warn you, this won't be easy.
We're very fortunate that Victoria was old enough to retain much of her vocabulary.
But it's still too early to determine if her social development...
What about the other one?
That's a different story.
Jesus.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Victoria.
Is that you, Lilly? Hey!
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Hey...
It's okay, it's okay.
I got something for you, for your eyes.
When you were a little girl, you had a pair of these. Do you remember?
I'm just gonna put... That's okay.
I'm just gonna put them here.
It's okay.
Yeah.
That's it.
Daddy?
No, no, honey. Honey, no. I'm...
I'm not your daddy, I'm...
I'm your daddy's brother.
Remember? Uncle Luke?
Dad?
Oh...
It's okay.
Dad?
It's okay.
Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss,
Your Honor.
The girls have been in my care at the Institute since they were found 87 days ago.
And how would you define their progress?
Solid, and astoundingly fast.
If I may?
Your Honor,
Victoria and Lilly Desange were found in deplorable conditions, isolated, starved. They feared and distrusted all physical contact.
Their emotional growth was clearly compromised by their abandonment.
In order to survive such extreme isolation, the girls created an imaginary guardian, a parent figure to feed them, sing to them, protect them.
They called her "Mama."
Victoria and Lilly have a real chance at a normal life now.
With the right care, physical and emotional development, and much-needed love and affection, they will get better.
Thank you, Dr. Dreyfuss.
Miss Podolski, would you care to address the court?
Good morning, Your Honor.
Jeffrey Desange murdered my niece and abandoned his daughters in the forest.
Now, his brother did an extraordinary thing.
Lucas never gave up on his nieces, but he did it for the girls, not for himself.
So if he still has their best interest at heart, he must know that neither his salary nor his very small apartment are suitable for the raising of two children, let alone two children with very special needs.
How many kids have you raised, Jean?
About as many as you, Lucas.
Of course she wants the girls, Lucas.
Stand in her shoes for a second.
She can't just sweep in and take them.
They're not hers to take.
I'm not sure that's entirely fair.
I'll tell you what's not fair. It's not fair that she gets to buy my nieces.
Would it really be such a bad thing?
What?
Annabel plays in a band. You draw pictures for a living.
The way you live, do you have room for children in your life?
I mean, really?
What are you saying, Gerald?
When it comes to the girls' welfare, the family court judge is pretty much obliged to act on my recommendation.
And right now, I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a slam dunk for Miss Podolski.
But the truth is,
I don't want them living on the other side of the country any more than you do.
So, we can really, really help each other out right now.
You want the girls, I need continued access to them.
What do we gotta do?
This house, courtesy of the
Institute, is used for case studies.
Rent free. You move to the house, you get the girls.
This is a joke, right?
Mr. Desange, is your brother still alive?
Has your brother contacted you?
Oh, son of a bitch.
Look, Jean...
No. I just want to see them, that's all.
You'll see them, I mean, you've got visitation rights, we respect that, but right now, we need a little space.
Just work on this thing for a while.
Find our feet.
Okay?
Excuse me.
October 26th.
Although she seems collaborative and is quickly recovering her language skills,
Victoria may be repressing the memory
of her experience in the wilderness.
Okay, Victoria, are you nice and relaxed?
Are you feeling sleepy?
I want you to tell me the story again.
Can you tell me the story?
It was a long time ago.
A lady ran away from a hospital for sad people.
She took her baby.
They jumped into the water.
How could you know that story, Victoria?
Did Mama tell you that story?
She showed me.
How?
In a dream.
Go on, Victoria.
And you can't tell anyone where you are?
Nope.
That's just bizarre, dude.
Yeah, well, it's for the girls, to keep the press away.
It's so messed up, though.
All families are messed up.
Yeah, but this one's messed up and instant.
Heck, I didn't even have the chance to screw 'em up, they came that way.
Leave him.
Can't.
You didn't sign up for this, babe.
I can't do that to him.
Mrs. Sensitivity.
You are in a rock band.
I was in a rock band, yeah.
Hey, girls.
Hey, come here.
Mama.
No, don't call me that,
I'm not your mom.
I'm Annabel, you can call me that.
Or Annie or whatever you like.
We could... We could work it out together, right?
Mama.
Handsome?
There are no police reports between 2008 and 2012 that match your patient's story.
And Doctor, there are no psychiatric hospitals anywhere near Clifton Forge.
Where would the closest one be?
Falls Church,
200 miles from here.
Now this logbook contains records from
St. Gertrude's Asylum, up by Douthat Lake.
That's 5 miles north from here.
But you told me that there were no mental hospitals in the area.
There aren't. St. Gertrude's shut down in 1878.
Page 31, patient Edith Brennan.
Annabel?
Yep?
Handsome's outside.
It's all right,
I put him there.
But, he's crying.
Awesome.
There's no way these kids are ready for this.
Babe, I know it's tough.
It'll get better, I promise.
I don't know if I can do this, Luke.
Hey, I love you, girl.
Oh, my God! Someone's here!
What? Victoria? Lilly?
No one's here.
Someone's here.
I saw them.
What, whoa, whoa, whoa, honey, honey!
I saw them!
Give me the hammer.
Give me the hammer!
I'll check downstairs, you look after the girls.
Lucas? Lucas?
Oh, my God! Lucas!
Hi, it's Vince with Slap Chop.
You can be the...
Chop, chop, chop. Chop, chop.
I'm really sorry, Annabel.
But they told me he responded well to the tests and it's very likely this coma's temporary.
What happens now?
I'm afraid I don't follow.
The girls. Now that Lucas is not...
The girls.
Annabel, the girls need you. They need security, predictability.
But I'm not prepared for this, I can't do this alone.
This isn't my job to do.
Just grow up. If you don't, you'll lose custody and Lucas will be lucky if he sees his nieces every second Thanksgiving.
Well, all checked out. All the doors and windows were locked, no evidence of an intruder, nothing stolen, so...
So I imagined it then, yeah?
All right, thank you, bud.
Ma'am.
Richmond's finest.
Okay, guys, just you and me for a while.
I don't know how you're feeling about that, but we don't got a choice.
How have they been affected by all of this?
They are talking to the walls.
What do they say?
Mama.
What is this?
They made that.
They found a doll in the cabin, Victoria. Who made the doll?
Mama.
The doll's called
"Mama," or Mama made the doll?
Mama made the doll.
And who is Mama?
Are you "Mama", Victoria?
- This is Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.
- Please leave a message.
Dr. Dreyfuss, this is Louise from Clifton Forge Public Records.
Hound something that you will want to see.
You guys okay?
What's so funny?
Good night.
No!
Whatever.
Nice butt, Bruce.
Victoria! Come. Mama.
You guys know what time it is?
I guess you wouldn't. It's late, it's really, really late.
Don't.
Don't what?
Don't go in the closet.
Why not?
What's in the closet?
Nothing.
Okay.
It's been a long day so you guys should get some sleep. Go to bed.
You want me to leave the door open?
Night.
Just tell me about it.
I think someone's coming to visit them.
Who?
I don't know.
And you believe that?
I heard her.
She was singing to them, it was like a lullaby or something.
You heard her?
Definitely a her?
Yeah.
Sound like this?
Yeah, but it was... It was different.
Her voice was deeper.
Victoria is showing signs of a dissociative personality disorder.
I think she could be taking on the role of Mama.
Literally becoming her.
It's treatable, with time and patience.
Am I safe?
What, from a crazy eight year old?
Give me a break.
I found a second entry under the name of that woman.
Edith Brennan?
Mad Edith Brennan.
Welcome to Aisle 17, Doctor.
Every archive has one, the lost-and-found of things people don't want to find.
Twenty years ago, when they moved the Clifton Forge cemetery, some of the oldest, smallest remains were not claimed by their relatives.
They were sent here to be filed.
I'm not a religious person, but I do believe there's a place for human remains, and it's not on a shelf in a government building.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I can't say that I do.
When a corpse is left out, the elements wither it, desiccate it, twisting it into a distorted figure that is barely recognizable as a human being.
A ghost is an emotion bent out of shape, condemned to repeat itself, time and time again, until it rights the wrong that was done.
What's this?
The wrong.
Jeff?
Save my girls.
Go to the cabin.
Code Blue!
He's seizing.
Hold him still.
Lorazepam, 4 milligrams.
Four milligrams of Lorazepam.
Is the line going?
It is.
Fever?
No fever, Doctor.
Mr. Desange, can you hear me?
It's okay, Mr. Desange.
You kick me off the bed,
I check on the girls.
That's about as much as I remember.
For all I know, it was you who pushed me.
Uh-uh.
I would have finished the job.
Oh, you drew me a picture!
It's a raccoon.
Thank you. I drew something for you guys, too.
There you go.
You like it?
Yes.
That's cute. So, how was it? Was it a tunnel with a light at the end?
Oh, yeah, yeah. It was beautiful. I was so not staying away from the light.
Ha, ha, ha.
So how's it been, life as a single mom?
It's great!
Yeah?
It's terrible.
They hate me.
They don't hate you.
They hate me.
They don't hate you.
So easy for you to say.
You're like the cool uncle.
I am the cool uncle.
What? What is it, Annie?
Just get well soon so you can come home and clean up their mess, please.
You sure that's it?
Yeah.
You okay?
What are you doing in here?
Here. I'll help.
What is it?
I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you mean?
I'm fine. Nothing bad's gonna happen to me.
You can't do that!
Why?
'Cause she gets jealous.
Hey, wait!
What's wrong with you?
Oh!
Hey, Jean. Um...
How can I help?
It's my day.
Are you sure? I thought that was Thursday.
It is Thursday.
Sorry about the mess.
Children make mess. That's how it works.
How are they?
Outdoorsy.
You want coffee?
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
What is this?
Yeah, I know, they're wild sometimes.
It's not an excuse.
Hey, now. They're bruises.
Kids get bruised.
This bruised?
It's not like that.
Let me have them.
Sorry?
Just for a few days.
You can, I don't know, play with your band, have a drink with your friends...
Jean, I think it's great that the girls have a relationship with their aunt,
I really, really do, but right now, you need to get out of my house before I kick your ass.
I'll see you both real soon, okay?
Hey!
Have you been coming around here?
I beg your pardon?
You been coming to the house, playing with the girls?
Of course not. Why?
Doesn't matter.
Richmond.
Social Services.
Uh...
Who should I speak to if I believe my nieces are being abused?
Well, what kind of evidence do I need exactly?
How the hell did you forget?
Are you kidding me?
You know she wants to take the girls from us!
I'm exhausted, I'm sorry,
I forgot today was her day.
Jesus Christ, Annie, it's one visit, it's not much to remember.
Annie, listen, they’re just kids, all you got to do is...
What? Chill out?
Take it easy?
You know, I can't do this, this is not my job.
This is your job.
I am out of here in a day, just hold it together until then.
All right, fine, yeah, we'll see what happens then.
I'll take care them, those girls are the most important thing in the world to me.
Awesome.
Annie, you...
Okay, Victoria, are you nice and relaxed?
Are you feeling sleepy?
I'd like you to tell me about Mama.
Did she live in that house with you?
The house by that lake?
Where did she live?
In the walls.
Where is she now?
I don't know.
I think you know.
I think you know where she is.
Where is she, Victoria?
Is she here in this house?
Did she come with you?
Open your eyes, Victoria.
Look at this photograph.
Is this Mama?
Is this Mama, Victoria?
Go away!
Tell me about her!
No!
Yes!
What's going on?
Nothing, nothing's going on.
Gerald, what happened?
I have to go.
I'll call you.
November 3rd.
The seventh session was more than revealing.
I think I have found a door,
a passage, that connects Helvetia and the Desange's house.
There is no rational explanation that supports this theory,
but it is only the ability to embrace a different reality
that makes science expand beyond the limits of what we know.
However, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
I now feel closer than ever to the real subject of my research.
I will come back from Clifton
Forge with an answer.
What's wrong?
What's under the bed?
Victoria?
Victoria! Come! Mama!
Victoria! Come! Mama!
Victoria stay.
Mama?
Where Mama?
I know your name.
I know what you want.
Lilly!
Lilly, Lilly, are you okay?
How did you get down here?
You're shitting me. Are you shitting me?
Come here, crazy!
Okay.
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop!
It's okay. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on, now...
Okay. Come here.
What?
You like that?
Okay!
Okay, door is good, window is bad.
So if we want to go outside, what do we do?
Use the stairs?
Right. Lilly?
Use the stairs?
Yeah. That's excellent.
Okay, let's go get breakfast.
Oh! God!
Lilly, you scared the crap out of me.
Annabel! Breakfast is ready!
I'll be right down!
Annabel! Lilly's hungry!
Annabel?
Yeah.
Victoria? You and Dr. Dreyfuss, you guys talk some...
I mean, you guys talked a lot, right?
Victoria, Dr. Dreyfuss and I, we talked some, too.
We talked about Mama.
You and Dr. Dreyfuss, you... You guys talked about Mama, too, right?
Who is Mama, Victoria?
- This is Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.
- Please leave a message.
Hey, it's Annabel,
I need to talk to you, so please call me whenever you get this, okay? Thanks, bye.
Yes, I talked to
Lieutenant Spencer two hours ago.
I'm sure you are.
I just don't understand.
I am afraid that something bad may have happened to the doctor.
You okay?
Stay there.
Come on, get your coats.
Richmond. I need the number for
Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Yeah.
I want you to tell me the story again.
Can you tell me the story?
It was a longtime ago.
A lady ran away from a hospital for sad people.
She took her baby,
They jumped into the water.
How could you know that story, Victoria?
Did Mama tell you that story?
She showed me.
How?
In a dream.
Go on.
She fell into the water, but the baby didn't.
Why?
I don't know.
What could have happened to the baby, Victoria?
I don't know.
Mama didn't show you?
She doesn't know what happened to her baby.
She went walking in the woods, looking for it.
She searched for a very long time.
And then?
Then she found us.
Why are you crying, Victoria?
'Cause she's sad.
Is she sad, or are you sad, Victoria?
Where is Mama?
Is she here, with us?
Can you show me Mama?
She won't come here.
Why not?
Because she knows you're watching.
This is Annabel. Leave your message at the beep. Fuck you! Beep!
Annabel?
Oh.
Hey, Victoria.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Good night, Annabel.
I love you.
No.
Lilly!
Lilly!
Don't look at her!
She's mad.
Run! Lilly!
Lilly!
Lilly, open the door!
Victoria!
What's going on?
Are you okay?
Annabel! It's Lilly!
Lilly? Are you okay?
Huh?
Mama! Stop it!
You promised!
Leave her alone!
Annabel! Annabel!
Aunt Jean?
Are you okay?
Lilly?
Victoria?
Hey, this is Lucas, leave a message.
Lucas, she has the girls.
I am heading to Clifton Forge.
Luke?
Luke!
Baby!
I got your message.
What the hell are you doing here?
Where are the girls?
She took them.
What?
I saw her, she's real.
What the hell is happening?
She's going to kill them.
We gotta get to the cabin.
She was here with them the whole time.
Dr. Dreyfuss knew it.
Oh, God!
Jean?
They're on the cliff!
Victoria! Lilly!
No.
No, no.
Mama!
No. Lilly! Lilly!
No!
Mama!
Edith!
Mama!
No!
Lilly?
Mama, no! Mama!
Mama!
Stay here.
Bye, Annabel.
Sleep, Annabel!
Victoria, Lilly.
- Sleep, Annabel.
- Sleep.
Sleep.
Goodbye, Mama,
I love you.
Victoria, come.
Victoria stay.
Come, Lilly, Mama, Victoria.
No, Lilly, Mama.
Lilly! Lilly!
Victoria, no!
Lilly! Lilly!
No! Please! No!
Lilly!
Oh, God, bring her back!
Baby!
Lilly!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
No.
No!
Luke?
Lilly?
Good morning, Presage employees.<i/>
We hope you're all ready for our exciting team-building retreat.
Please enjoy your breakfast...
...and then make your way to the bus, which will leave shortly.
Hey, Sam, when I said, "Would you put breakfast together for the retreat?"...
...I meant, like, some stale doughnuts, some coffee.
But this is amazing.
Thanks, man. Just remember that when you see my sales report for last month.
Oh, I saw it last night.
Shit. Has Dennis seen it?
Not yet.
Look, you just need to make a decision, you know?
Are you gonna be "chef" or are you gonna be "sales guy"?
I'm saying that as your friend because, as your boss, I'm ready to fire your ass.
-As your friend, I appreciate that advice.
-Good.
[EVERCLEAR'S "l WILL BUY YOU

Yeah, I guess I'm doing okay
I moved in with--

SAM:
Molly. Your ticket's canceled.
Tell me that's a mistake.
I was gonna tell you after this weekend.
Uh, tell me what?
That I don't think it's such a good idea.
What, the trip? it's my brother's wedding.
What's going on here?
We should talk about this later.
Let's just--
What, pretend like I didn't see this for the next two days? No, let's talk about this.
It's not working out, Sam.
We're not working out.
Hey.
Hey. Oh, it's, uh, Candice, right?
-Not funny.
.-Oh--..
Okay, sorry, this is not a vacation.
Okay, this is a business retreat.
So we're gonna be all business for the next two days.
Sorry.
I love you, but doesn't change the fact that you're still an intern.
[CANDICE SIGHS]
Oh, um, but that 12:30 curfew tonight?
You should plan on breaking that.
Why?
For the naked team-building.

[IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT]
Hey, Olivia.
Don't forget these.
Oh, yeah. I keep trying to.
-Hmm.
-I like it. it's very Lisa Loeb.
Oh, well, you know...
...I'd rather be very Olivia.
We get a gig on Sunday.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Morning, Peter.
-Looking good.
-Uh, hi.
Olivia. Have you slept with every hipster in town yet?
Candice. Do you actually get paid for this internship...
...or does Daddy just increase your allowance?
You know, if you wanna get rid of that baby fat, you should try the gym.
They have these workout machines that you use on your back.
You're good at that.
Sweetie, it's not fat.
They' re called tits.
You're not lacking so hat there,
Mall-face.
Gee, thanks.
Did you try the little jam-bread whatever your boyfriend made?
I gotta tell you, he's a pre-- Uh-oh, that's what it is, is it? Did I touch a nerve?

...I've been told I'm a good listener by a lot of ladies. Shh, Wait.
Tell me this is Kimber from last Tuesday.
Wait, I'm sorry, which Kimber is--?
Hey, let's sit next to each other on the bus.
No, no, I remember you.
You were, like, a bigger gal, right?
You know what you should do?
You should apologize.
-why?
-Doesn't matter.
Never matters. "I'm sorry, because l--"
[HORN HONKING] oh, sun.
Hey, Stan, how's it going?
Uh, it's Sam, sir.
Did you just correct me?
SAM [STAMMERS]:
No. look at me.
-What's my name?
-Dennis. look away.
All set, Pete?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, we're just waiting on Nathan.
What's the one thing we can't recycle, Pete?
Wasted time, sir.
Exactly. I wanna be on the road in 90 seconds.
Uh, well, I just saw his car, so I'll go track him down.
Way to show some initiative, Stan.
It's gonna be a good day.
SAM: Hey, guys.
MAN 1: Hey, man.
SAM:
What's up, bud?
MAN:
Why you riding Nate so hard, man?
ROY: You know,
I'm just trying to make sense of it here.
Three weeks ago they brought you in as assistant plant manager...
-...and now you got a day off?
-It's not a day off. It's a re-- Re--
Re-- Re-what? Retarded?
It's a retreat.
It's a retreat.
NATHAN:
I don't wanna go. I'm just following orders.
-So if you don't like it, then you can--
ROY: I can what? What? I can what?
Nathan, hey. Come on, man, we're all waiting for you.
-Yeah, okay.
-Now, hold on. What you gonna say?
What you gonna say?
I got 15 years on you here. You got, what, four years in some classroom upstate?
Listen, if you think I'm gonna sit here--
Not a good idea, Roy.
Not a good idea, man.
We're fine for the day.
Why do you let him get away with that?
No choice. He's the union rep.
I fire him and suddenly
I've get a factory full of Rays.
But I'll win him over, even if it kills me.
What about you?
When are they gonna offer you that permanent gig at the restaurant?
-They already did.
-Dude, that's great.
SAM:
I don't know, man.
I mean, they wanna send me to the flagship restaurant in Paris...
...for who knows how long?
Could be six months, could be a year.
I just thought
I'd be leaving too much behind.
Although new I'm not so sure.
Well, look, if you do go to Paris, do me a favor.
-What's that?
-Take Ray with you.
Aw, hell, no.
[KNOCKING]
NATHAN:

Hey, Katrina, how you doing?
Nah, just this stupid retreat thing with the idiots from the office.

We all gotta get off.
What are you talking about?
-The bridge is gonna collapse.
-What?
-We're all gonna die.
-What the hell is going on?
We're all gonna die if we don't get off this bridge now!
Stan, relax, it's just some construction.
Molly, please. Please, God, follow me.
Open the door.
This is a major liability issue. If something happens to them, it's on us, you get that?
-Yeah.
-Then go get that.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, all right.
Hey, Sam? Molly?
SAM: Peter, please, just follow.
PETER: Come on!
Okay, everybody just calm down.
-I'm gonna go help.
-Please don't.
PETER:
Hey, guys, came on!
SAM:
Let's go!
PETER: Sam, just get back on the bus.
We can talk about it.
Molly, Sam, came on, guys.
Did he seem weird to you when he get on the bus?
No, he was fine. it's like he just snapped.
-What's going on?
-What the hell is going on out here?
[CABLES SNAPPING]
DENNIS:
We should, uh ....
ISAAC:
Holy shit!
DENNIS:
Get off the bus!
[CROWD SCREAMING]
SAM:
Come on!
How did you know?
MAN:
That's the big question here.
How did you know?
It says right here in your statement:
"l saw it collapse.
I knew it would happen."
That sounds premeditated to me.
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.
I had a vision.
Okay. A vision.
Psychic phenomena, ghosts, Bigfoot.
You actually believe in that stuff?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what I believe:
There's an answer for everything.
There's an answer for why you knew to warn everyone...
...the bridge was going to collapse, and minutes later, it did.
I told you, I saw it coming.
I don't know how.
I just did.
And no one else did?
Like I said, it just came out of nowhere.
Did Sam have issues with authority?
Did he ever demonstrate any sort of extremist behavior?
No.
Wait. "Extremist behavior"?
You mean like a terrorist?
You see him talk to anyone that morning?
On a cell phone, pay phone?
Just his girlfriend.
His ex-girlfriend, I mean. Molly.
-But that was in person.
-Molly.
Ex.
BLOCK:
Tell me about the breakup.
Was he upset? Scale of 1 to 10.
It's personal.
You must have been pissed, right?
Getting dumped like that.
What does that have to do with anything?
I'm just trying to get all the pieces of the puzzle together...
...before I start moving them around, making them fit.
Lack, I just had a hunch that something had was gonna happen. That's it.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Excuse me.
Forensics came back with the analysis.
-And?
-They're chalking it up to high winds...
...and structural damage from the construction.
"High winds"?
AGENT:
Yeah. Send everyone home.
You're free to go.
I have a feeling we'll be seeing each other again.
Call it a hunch.
WOMAN [ON TV]: Authorities are calling the North Bay Bridge collapse...
...a freak act of nature...
...citing a highway improvement project that may have weakened the superstructure.
Among the survivors were eight employees of Presage Paper...
...on their way to a business retreat.
The other 17 employees were killed in the collapse.
And although they've been branded the "lucky eight"...
...the surviving employees new face an uncertain future.
NATHAN:
Hey, guys.
MOLLY:
Hey.
PETER:
Hey.
Anybody know when this thing's supposed to start?
When Dennis gets here, I guess.
That agent still hounding you?
No. You heard the news, it was natural causes.
Yeah, more like supernatural.
How you holding up? I tried calling.
No, yeah, I saw. I was just tired.
ISAAC:
So?
How did you explain it?
I didn't.
I couldn't.
Sam, there had to be a reason.
Heh. That is exactly what the agent kept saying.
Whatever answer you're lacking for,
I don't have it.
Yeah, Sam's right.
It doesn't matter how it happened.
We should all just put it behind us and be grateful we're still alive.
Definitely beats the alternative, right?
DENNIS:
I look out at the faces today...
...and I see family members, friends.
But the people that left us on the bridge that day, they were more than that.
People like Jennifer Alcott...
...Chris Boylan...
...David Buckler.
Maybe you worked next to them.
Maybe you worked for them.
But we all worked with them, huh?
Who can forget Trevor Wino's smile?
Or Isaac Palmer.
Did he just say my name?
[OLIVIA SNORTS]
-That's not funny.
-I know, I'm sorry.
I just get weird with tragedies. I'm sorry.
[WHISPERS]
I see dead people.
[OLIVIA LAUGHING]
Guys.
Death...
...doesn't like to be cheated.
Excuse me?
What's that supposed to mean?
You all just be careful now.
PETER:
Okay. Thanks for the advice!
Creepy guy.

What's the matter with it?
Said it was flat. No flavor.
-Do they want something else?
MIKE: Yeah.

Let me taste it.
The customer is an asshole.
The bourguignon is good.
MOLLY:
Hold on.
You mind if I came in?
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks.
I thought you'd be working tonight.
Yeah. You know,
I worked the first shift, but...

[WHISTLING]
-Can l...?
-Oh.
Yeah. Sure, go ahead.
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
Thank you.
Listen ....
When everything started going down on that bridge...
...the only thing I thought about was you.
Getting you to safety.
You are the only thing
I care about, Molly.
Whatever's wrong, I can fix it.
You haven't done anything wrong.
Then, what? What is it?
Paris.
We talked about that.
I'm not going to uproot my life, leave you, for that jab.
But it's the only thing you've ever dreamed of.
Life is too short, Sam.
You have to go after what you love.
I am.
You should take the jab.
Go to Paris.
-Hey.
CANDICE: Hey.
What's the matter?
I don't know. I'm not ready.
I don't feel ready.
It's been really hard to concentrate after everything.
Yeah? Are you sure?
Yeah.
Because this is the last practice before the championship.
And it's your last practice of your college career.
CANDICE:
I know, but ....
I think you get this.
-Really?
PETER: Yeah.
I mean, you love it out there.
Okay. You're right.
And besides, coach would kill me. Heh.
Yeah.

Thanks.

You gotta hit that follow-up.
GIRL 1: I'm sore from the back extensions.

They've gotta make it cooler or we're gonna pass out.
They're working on it.

Peter.
I came as soon as I heard.
She was doing great.
She was almost finished with her routine and then ....
Why did it happen?
This doesn't make any sense.
I don't know, man.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Peter.
Let's just go, Sam.
Hey.
How's it going?
It's weird.
Being here, I mean.
It's just so quiet.
Yeah, well, Dennis had all the calls rerouted to corporate.
Yeah, well, it's depressing.
Holy crap. Did you guys get your bereavement pay yet?
Hey, what's he doing here?
I think he just needed the distraction.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a bummer about Candice.
Guess we all should have seen that coming.
What?
You see the crazy shit those gymnasts do.
I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.
MAN [OVER SPEAKERPHONE]:
Once you've handled the e-mail...
...you'll need to deactivate all the key cards of the deceased employees.
Instructions are in your binder.
Well, shouldn't that be the jab of the facility manager?
The facility manager's dead.

Dennis, you want me to fly someone up there?
No, no, I get it.
Aw, Debbie.
You were so naughty.
[COINS JINGLING]
Fuck it.
Robert, my man.
Ow.
Shit.
You shouldn't have, buddy.
Hey, man, what are you doing up here?
Had to get off the factory floor, man.
Roy's driving me crazy.
So, uh, who wants one?
Where'd you get these?
I stole it out of Roy's truck.
Ha, ha. It's good, right? Ha, ha.
I get something better.
OLIVIA:
Ooh, nice one.
Yeah, count me in.
Are you sure you wanna share that?
If I don't, I'll end up drinking it alone, which is just sad.
Well, this day just got way more fun.
No, I did call you.
Of course. I just called you right now, didn't I?
Because I really do wanna take you out again.
Yeah, yeah, we'll do, like, a nice romantic dinner.
You know, somewhere maybe outside the city.
Hold up.
You know what? I gotta go.
No, no, no. I'm not blowing you off.
Hey, listen. Hey, who's my girl, Kimber?
Amber, yes, that's what I said.
Excuse me.
Amber? Amber, I'm sorry, wait a second.
Is that weird sound on your end or mi--?
Sorry about that. My, uh, sister tends to get a little chatty sometimes.
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.
So tell me about stress relief.
And what does this really get me?
This covers a session for two different physical therapies.
Like massage therapy?
Erotic massage?
This is a family operation.
Everyone on staff is professional.
Hey, that's great. I prefer a professional.
In fact, you know what? I kind of demand it.
I'm just trying to clarify, though, that this professional experience ends, uh...
[WHISPERS]
...happy.
I know exactly what you need.

Maybe I should go.
Don't know what that means. No idea. Yep.
Ow!
Fuck!
No, no, that's okay.
That's okay, I'm all right.
Holy shit, you're strong.

To, uh, finding new jobs.
Because it's only a matter of time before they shut us down.
-Hear, hear.
-Oh. Tc starting over.
SAM:
Peter?
It just doesn't make sense.
She dies doing something that she's done...
...almost every day for the last 15 years of her life.
She said she didn't wanna do it.
She said she wasn't ready.
And I should have stopped her.
I should have done something.
I should've--
Peter, there wasn't anything you could've done.
How do you know?
[GLASS SHATTERS]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hello, Agent Block? This is Dennis.
Yeah, Peter just freaked out about something, I don't know what.
Does that mean anything?
[OVER PHONE]
You told me to call if I saw anything odd.
I don't know yet, but thank you, Dennis, and call me if you see anything strange.
Stranger.
Should we maybe have code names for one another, do you think?
Over and out.
All right, ahem, show me how this happened.
I don't think I can.

What do you mean?
I mean, I could try it a hundred times and never re-create exactly what happened here.

Hey.
That's not very nice, you know.
Okay, your thumbs are kind of in my eyes.
I'm not gonna lie, it's a little annoying.

I don't have a clue what you're saying.

Yeah, you know, you said it yourself.
Like, you're gonna have to start over.
Start over with me.
How many drinks have you had?
Enough. Molly, I'm serious.
Lack, you were right.
If I don't take the jab, I'll regret it.
But I'm not willing to lose you.
Why does it have to be one or the other?
I'm better when you're with me.
Uh, guys, you're not gonna believe this.
They're saying it was a freak accident.
Yeah, raise your hand if you believe that.
Who dies during a massage? Seriously.
PETER:
First Candice, new Isaac.
It can't be a coincidence.
It's not.
Where are you going?
NATHAN: it's that creepy dude.
SAM:
Why are you following us?
Who are you?
You were at the cemetery, then the gym, new here.
What are you doing?
My job.
[BLUDWORTH WHISTLING]
SAM:
What's happening to us?
What makes you think I know anything?
SAM:
You warned us.
At the memorial service.
You said Death didn't like to be cheated.
It's just that I've seen this before.
You've seen what?
A lucky few survive a disaster.
And then one by one,
Death comes for them all.
You changed things on that bridge.
There's a wrinkle in reality.
And that wrinkle is you.
So, what, we're doomed to die?
I mean, is that it?
We just get our lives back, so, what kind of fucked up karma is that?
Are you saying that we can't stop this?
You were supposed to die on that bridge.
You're not supposed to be here.
You shorted Death.
So you let Death have somebody else in your place...
...and then you take their spot in the realm of the living.
All the days and years that they have yet to live.
And they take your place in death.
Then the books are balanced.
Wait a minute. We kill someone, we get their life? Is that what you're telling me?
I don't make the rules.
I just clean up after the game is over.
[ENGINE STARTS]
Maybe that's why
Candice and Isaac are dead.
They weren't supposed to survive, and new it's coming after the rest of us.
No.
No, not all of us.
Molly made it, she didn't die.
What?
Well, when I had that vision, or premonition, or whatever it was...
...I got you across before the bridge collapsed.
You survived.
You saved her?
Why, because you decided that she deserved to live more than the rest of us?
That's not what he's saying. I don't deserve to live more than anyone.
You deserve to live more than Candice.
Whoa, Peter, hang on.
NATHAN:
No, look, guys, came on.
You're not drinking the Kool-Aid, are you?
Killing people to survive Death's list. Really?
I may not know what's going on, but it's not what that guy's selling.
Yeah? What else is it, then?
Shit.
We need to tell Olivia.
Come on.
OLIVIA:
My farms are all signed.
MAN: I see that it's been quite a while since your first consultation.
What made you decide to take the leap today?
Uh, well, a lot is going on in my life...
...and I just don't wanna miss anything...
...you know, important.
Same reason I had it done myself.
-Came on in back. Let's get you started.
-Okay.
Oh.
LEONOTTI: Yep, that's the first step.
You'll never need those again.
[OLIVIA CHUCKLES]
Here we are. Come on in.
What's with these?
Oh, just for some of our younger patients.
And, um, sometimes our older ones too.
Come on.
[DRONING]
What was that?
Relax.
You know, it lacks a lot worse than it really is.
Okay, I'm gently going to position your head...
...and I want you to tell me...
...when this feels snug.
I can't move my head.
Perfect. Just what we want.
There we go.
Okay, now comes the fun part.
Here comes a drop.
And you will feel a little numbness in your eye...
...which is a good thing.
Deep breath.
Relax.
Very good.

There.
That's not so bad, is it?
Looks good.
[CREAKING]
-What was that?
-Just relax, Olivia.
I'm just gonna enter some data into ....

She might be in danger.
She's fine.
We do this kind of procedure all the time.

[DOTTIE & DETECTIVE
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Sam.
Stay with me tonight, please.
Of course.
Five different systems had to go wrong...
...for that laser to fail us so spectacularly. Five.
What do you want from us?
I want you to tell me what you think is going on.
Two deaths? Okay, all right.
That's a coincidence.
Three? That's a pattern.
Now...
...I know you two didn't do this.
All right?
But I think you know something.
What is it?
We don't know anything.
Take a guess.
We think we weren't supposed to survive on that bridge.
What?
And new something is trying to set it right.
"Something"?
That's all you got?
SAM:
Right now, yeah.
But if you came up with any other explanations, let us know.
Thank you.
"Something"
Hey.
Been up long?
Uh, I don't know. I couldn't sleep.
I just kept thinking about the bridge.
Sam, you can't do this to yourself.
No. No, no, no. I was thinking about, in the premonition...
...we all get off the bus, but the ground gave way and Candice fell.
Then the bus tipped over.
And Isaac, he never get off the bus.
He went with it.
What are you getting at?
I know that there was just so much going on ....
Lack, I know that I helped you across.
Then I reached back for Olivia.
But she didn't make it. She fell.
So first was Candice.
[SCREAMS]
Then Isaac.
Then Olivia.
[SCREAMS]
They're dying in order.
Who dies after Olivia?

NATHAN [OVER PA]: Roy, would you come to the control room, please?
MAN: Uh-ch, Roy, that's the boss.
You in trouble, Roy.
ROY: Okay, schoolboy, what do you wanna talk to me about?
NATHAN: What is with your timecard?
ROY: Let's talk about my timecard.
You cut my hours, which means you cut my pay!
I cut everyone's hours, okay?
Corporate has us operating at less than
50 percent until this thing blows over.
My bookie ain't operating at 50 percent.
-My dumb kid ain't operating at 50 percent.
-Ray.
My ex-wife, she's taking 50 percent, so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
No, we gotta move, man.
ROY: Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Hey!
NATHAN: Look, we gotta move! Gotta move!
We gotta move now!
[ROY GRUNTS THEN SCREAMS]
NATHAN:
Roy! You okay down there?
-Hey, Dennis?
DENNIS: Hey.
They're closing us down.
They're shutting down the plant?
Not the plant, just us.
Just sales and administration.
Can you believe it? Us?
It's the factory guys that usually get laid off.
Not us, we're supposed to be safe.
Yeah, Dennis, we get bigger problems.
Olivia and Isaac are dead.
Who's Isaac?
Isaac Palmer, tech support.
Wasn't he dead already?
No, Dennis.
Listen, it's going to happen to us too if we don't do something about it.
Yeah, I understand.
Listen, it's called survivor's guilt.
No. No, guilt doesn't kill you.
Obviously, you've never met my in-laws.
I'm not fucking around here, Dennis.
Anyone could be next.
It could be you. Understand?
Nobody's safe.
What are you talking about?
We weren't supposed to survive that bridge collapse.
And so new it's kill or be killed.
You get that, Dennis?
Whatever.
I warned you.
Do whatever you wanna do.
[DOOR CLOSES]
I will.
Hey, Agent Black, it's Dennis. Um--
Listen, Pete just came in here and he's just completely lost it.
He's yelling about "kill or be killed."
Oh, yeah, it definitely sounded like a threat.
What happened?
NATHAN: I don't know. I don't know.
It just happened so fast.
-Nathan. Are you okay?
-Yeah.
-We heard, and we thought--
-No. No, uh, I'm good.
Did you kill him?
What?
No. No, I just--
It was just timing, you know?
He get in the way and--
No, you did, didn't you?
You saw it coming, and then you tack his life. You put him in the way.
No, I didn't really do anything.
-Tell us the truth: Did you or didn't you?
-Hey, Peter, calm down.
Did you or didn't you?
Did you or didn't you?
Yes. I think I did.
I killed him.
So if the theory works, then you traded spots.
He should have your death, and you should have his years.
How do we know for sure?
I think there's an order to these deaths.
They mirror the order everyone died in on the bridge.
Then who would be next?
Who wants to be first to tell me what the hell happened?
Who is it, Sam?
Who's what?
[ALL GASPING]
Dennis! It was Dennis.
No shit.
MAN:
Jesus.
Why are you fighting me on this?
You're not seriously going to work, are you?
Molly, Isaac died on a massage table.
If Death is gonna came for me,
I don't think it matters where I am.
You have to do something.
-What, kill someone so I can live?
-No, of course not.
We'll just have to figure something else out.
I have figured it out.
Something saved me on that bridge.
Maybe it doesn't want me to die.
Maybe.
We can't live our lives in fear, Moll.
So if it happens tomorrow, or 50 years from now, whatever.
As long as we're together...
...I'll be okay.
Right? Why don't you came by after my shift...
...and I'll make you a nice late dinner, okay?
All right, give me this.

Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, came in.
Here, have a seat.
Thanks.
Hey, Peter.
Hi, Molly.
Peter, can I get you anything to eat?
I can make you up some pasta.
Uh, no. No, no, no. I'm good.
Uh, thank you.
Uh, I'm sorry. I just thought--
It's good that you're here.
You shouldn't be alone right now.
Yeah, you know,
I'm surprised I'm here at all.
Uh ....
Still alive, I mean.
I'm next to go, right?
It's me and then you, isn't it?
Anyways, uh, I was up all last night, you know...
...thinking about if I could really do it.
-Do what?
-Take someone else's life.
If I could actually kill some stranger, replace their life with my own.
And I thought about it.
And I convinced myself that...
...yeah, I could.
So I went on a walk.
You know, nowhere in particular...
...but every couple of minutes, an opportunity would just present itself.
Heh. Like clockwork.
I could just grab somebody and pull them into an alley.
Or just shave somebody off a curb into traffic.
You know?
It'd be real easy.
Peter, what did you do?
-Did you...?
-No, I didn't.
I couldn't.
I realized that...
...I couldn't kill somebody that didn't deserve to die.
And I thought about Candice, and I thought, "Wait a minute.
Candice didn't deserve to die.
Olivia didn't. Dennis didn't.
I don't."
Do I?
No, of course you don't.
Well...
...none of us deserve to die, then why is it...
...that you deserve to live, Molly?
You said it yourself...
...you don't.

-I'm not gonna let you hurt her, Peter.
You're gonna have to kill me first.
Well, that doesn't do me any good.
Heh, heh.
Death's after you too.
This is crazy, Peter. Don't do this.
Just think for a minute, all right?
You are not a killer.
I don't wanna kill anybody, Sam.
I don't wanna die yet either.
[BOTH GRUNT]
Heh. it's not your time yet.
Don't worry, Molly...
...I didn't kill him.
But I didn't need to, Molly...
...because Death is gonna do that for me.
Doesn't mean I can't help it.
That's it.
-Are you okay? What's going on?
-it's Peter. He has a gun.

THE SILENT HOUSE (2010)
A STORY BASED ON REAL EVENTS
THE SILENT HOUSE
He's not here yet.
Here is very dilapidated.
Begin with the grass on the back and work your way forward.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. I'm just looking around.
Wilson, how are you?
- Excuse the delay.
- It's okay.
It is long overdue. As I said, I want the Seller house-
- But I'll fix it up a bit. Have you seen it?
I said to my daughter, we were up early to take advantage of day.
- I have water and blankets.
- Laura!
- How is the village?
- The same. Nothing has changed.
One realizes that the time passes when you see the kids.
You will then house the Seller?
I live in town now-
- And my brother and I want to sell our properties in the area.
So we see you not here again?
I always come back. All the memories, you know ...
- May you wait long?
- No, we just got here.
Let's go inside.
There is a torch for Laura.
Wilson, came with me.
It's worse than I thought. But it's even worse upstairs.
Loose tiles throughout. This is dangerous. Do not go there.
Go this way.
Come on, Wilson.
There are some candles here.
- Here are some sofas. Handles ljer?
- No problems.
We are doing everywhere. Do not worry.
How long do I?
Two, three days viljeg faith. If the weather holds.
We thought we would start with the back-
- And finish on the front.
- Sound good?
- Yes, then. You're the expert.
- It's our plan.
- Incidentally ...
Come and see here.
This door ...
Through it you come out slightly to the front.
Okay.
Good.
Here are the keys. I come with food later.
- No, it is not needed.
- Me do not do anything.
I f酶Iger you out.
- Do you already have a buyer?
- Yes, but it takes a few weeks.
Negotiations have already been going on for a while.
Laura, I put it here.
Father!
- Did you hear that?
- What!
Sound.
- What sound?
- There is no outside.
There is no one out there, Laura. Just slept on.
Dad, you must awaken.
Did you not find it?
- What!
- It was the sound again.
On the first floor.
We go up and examine it.
We do f酶Igende:
I walk up and look.
But n氓rjeg comes down again, then you sleep. Okay?
Father!
Father!
What happened to you?
Wake up, Dad.
You must awaken.
What happened?
Calm down.
What did they do? What happened?
What happened?
Fort忙I what happened.
Say it now.
- They attacked us.
- Who?
I do not know.
- No, I will not back!
- Stop it.
I must investigate.
- Where's your father? Where is he?
- I do not know.
- So we must look for him.
- I will not back!
I am not going back!
Do not go there.
- Wait here, I go in and look.
- No! I beg you!
- Come on!
- I will not.
There are more dangerous out here. There is nobody in the house.
There is no one there. Come just.
Come on.
Did you move your furniture?
- Nestor. Nestor!
- Be there!
Wilson!
Replace the lamp from you.
Laura ...
Where's your father?
I do not know.
Over which they fell to him?
On the first floor.
I went up there.
Wilson! Wilson!
Be quiet.
Here.
Wait here.
I said I would not go up here.
Why did I come here?
Father!
Father!
He is not here.
He is not here, Laura.
It's a long time since anyone has been here.
Now we go, Laura. He is not here.
Nestor?
Nestor!
Nestor!
Nestor!
What have they done to you?
Are you all right?
What happened?
Who attacked you. Look at me.
Nestor ...
What is happening in this house?
Why, Laura?
Why?
I saw the photos.
- What photos?
- Photographs.
- What are you talking about?
- The photographs of your room!
Photographs!
What are you saying, Laura?
Do you miss her?
- Who?
- Her.
- Who?
- Our daughter. Do you miss her?
- Fort忙I her. She is here.
- I miss you.
You lie!
Do you love me?
Do you?
Why did not you?
I've been waiting for you.
I am here with you.
I'm here.
Hj忙Ip me.
Be quiet!
Laura ...
I called your dad to meet with you. Therefore, I called.
- I wanted to meet you.
- Shut up!
- Do you remember it?
- Shut up!
Do you remember ... we agreed to discuss it.
You knew we could not keep her.
What did you do to your father? Did you kill him, Laura?
- Keep your mouth shut so!
- He knew it was the best ...
Listen to me.
Keep as your mouth shut!
You lied to me.
He lied to me like you did.
I murdered my child!
You will die like my father.
Smile.
Smile.
Six days after they found the mutilated simi-
- Along with some creepy polaroid images.
Despite overv忙Idende evidence was investigating not complete.
The case was terminated eight months later.
Laura was never found.
Sofi!
Sofi!
Where are you fine!
Playing you?
Shall we visit grandma?
It erjo so long since we've seen her.
We are going on horse-
- And eat sweets.
We go that route.
We can swim.
Would you like to swim?
Grandma has a canoe.
It is like a small boat.
Do you know what a canoe? Not?
It is a tiny boat.
We can sit three in it.
You, grandmother and me.
And also the doll.
Grandma would then like to see you-
- But she lives very far away.
We must go, go and go.
Over there ...
... Can we see ...
A lot of sunlight.
Out in the meadow.
Sticks it?
No!
Orcs do not have to go further?
Sofi, I love you so much.
There is a tree with a house in.
I played there as a child. I went there every day.
You may also play into it.
It lies near the lake.

Come on.
What happened?
The mortuary called the hospital.
Said she had made one mistake.
They almost were trying to anoint him.
They buried my grandfather last spring.
What if he was still alive.
Will, he was 95 years old.
Of course he was dead.
If it is not dead, then he does that
After spending five hours with her mother.
They get all of your guts before you show a box stop.
No one is currently alive buried.
You did it.
I told you, it is on your key, the lock is in order.
It is a copy, right?
- I do not know.
Let's go.
Caution.
Okay, I got one.
Does it have anything to do with the terrible accidents or robbing of corpses?
No. But it's true.
- Sure.
No, it's true
- I want to hear it.
Good.
It is early in the morning.
Very early.
And a couple comes from a store.
It was probably a restaurant, one of those 24-hour breakfast eateries.
You are bad at telling stories.
It must have been a restaurant, otherwise it has not been opened.
They had stayed up all night and decided breakfast instead of going home.
You know how that goes.
Most importantly, it was very early and there were very few people.
As they walk to their cars, are they passed a guy.
None of them had ever seen.
But as she passed him, they walk literally against him.
And that unknown squeezes past them back and mumbles "sorry".
And before anyone can react, remove
He scissors from under his coat... and starts them in their face and neck to stabbing.
What was their friend?
- She was screaming, probably.
She watched her friend was stabbed, without reason.
Anyway, there was a cop, out of service in the restaurant.
Its just on Sat night. He pulls his gun and shoot down the psycho.
And that's the real story?
There are these crazy people out here.
Can you imagine a restaurant and you will be stabbed?
Will we get it in time?
What time do these things closed?
Will it give the blame if we do not on time.
He was the one that our poor road pointed.
That's not my fault. No one showed me told that we do not have coverage.
This was my GPS useless.
Why are we here?
There is no labyrinth closer to home?
As this is the biggest grain labyrinth in the province.
Sometimes it takes hours to get through to come.
I went as a child often used to a labyrinth.
I do not think we have time hours.
For the same money, kick them out now all people.
We'll just have to wait.
After all it is only seven hours.
We can always do something else.
Here, something else? Maybe if you enjoy looking at cow scare.
I'm not boerrinetje.
No one says you are, Klara.
Wait, Trientje?
Wait, or Suurtje?
Those things you are dead.
I mean it.
The Rabbit Hole''''
Will.
They're cute.
Acorn.
Yes.
I just wanted to help get out.
- Liar.
I did not really scare.
It is closed.
Thank you. We knew that already
What do we do now?
Still a little early, huh?
- Yes, the days are getting shorter.
It is cold here, when the sun is.
Thank you. We knew that already
Collin.
What are you doing?
I'm going to see the maze.
Do not be stupid.
That is off limits.
It's a corn maze, we will not steal or something.
I thought you wanted sleeping cows scare.
Come on.
Look, this is great.
Look.
Did you hear that?
Stop, you're paranoid.
Come on.
If we are arrested, I say that
I was forced.
You know Bonnie shot he teamed up with Clyde, eh?
Bonnie was a jerk.
Never leave a man planning a robbery,
He will always exaggerate.
He thinks that if he 'wields a weapon, and "wearing a mask, he is invincible.
You do not know what you're talking about.
Weapons are sexy.
And why did you not have a girlfriend.
That looks scary.
Yack.
Walking around in 'n labyrinth but for a while fun.
How long are we going to do?
Can I have your necklace look like?
See?
You're it.
You're it.
A
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
This is pretty fun.
Yes. It sure is.
Until Cole and Jordan do not finish for the evening is over.
Come on, you know that Jordan is not considered.
She would never say something Cole deliberately hurting.
She broke up with him, that seems pretty intentional.
That's not fair.
Okay, you go this way, and I'm going that way.
No. Do not leave me alone.
It's more fun when we split up.
Okay then.
Turn that thing off.
You look like a buoy.
Collin?
You... are .. him.
It suits you.
Give me a few seconds to get away.
A.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Who has not vanished...
Who was that?
That was not funny.
Cole?
That had me fall.
Hello? Will?
Will?
I can not...
I've dropped my glasses. I see nothing.
Collin, is it you?
Sorry.
Collin, if it's you, do you want first help to find my glasses.
Come on, I can not see.
He must be here somewhere.
What are you doing?
Stop it.
Collin?
Cole?
Dude, just come forth, so
I can type.
Haunt me is not funny.
Hey, you're not...
Who are you?
Wait.
We are doing nothing wrong here.
Will, I'm glad I found you.
I shall be very afraid of this labyrinth.
Shit.
You're it.
I am sure him.
Have you seen the way Collin?
He is doing very scary things.
Allison, there is someone else in the maze.
What do you mean?
Someone else outside our five?
Yes, I just saw him, he was just here.
I saw him, Will.
What do you mean? You just saw him?
- I just saw him. my glasses fell, I could not see anything and then someone came to, I'm Collin.
Allison, what happened?
He grabbed me and hit his arm around me.
I just thought it was Collin.
Come on, let's go find him and we will organize this.
If anyone here, then I not find him, Will.
Listen, I have the keys. Why do we will not leave here, to the car?
So you think we are all here to leave behind?
No, I think it is safer if we go to the car.
No. It is safer if we all stay together.
Come on.
I'm not him.
I would have tapped.
- Let me see your neck.
What if you do not have stopped somewhere else?
- Is not that cheating.
I do not know the rules that we use.
If I had to, I would have long since caught up.
I'm faster than you anyway.
But, if I'm not me and we walk together... you know you're always safe with me.
Yes, but then I walk with you.
That's like have to choose between two bad ones.
I bake anything from this game.
Will, what is it?
- Nothing. I'm just around.
Do you think this is real?
I do not know.
Will, I really think we should leave here, and...
What are you doing, dickhead?
You people can not be intimidated to walk.
Will?
Boy, Allison.
Will have to catch her.
- So Will is it?
I had told you that.
What about her? Even if they want, she can not make noise now.
Being afraid is not always a bad trait.
Sometimes it's even more fun.
If we are arrested by, it's a bad habit.
She must learn to control themselves.
Will and Allison still play it?
Or are they're not 't have sex?
They're probably behind one another, and are not looking for one of us.
Brian, Sarah.
I'll call just because I thought we would see each other about nine hours... so I think I call you later.
I'm sorry. I have nothing from him heard.
We could go a few hours ago and he is never coming days.
Yes, definitely.
Let me know if I hear something from him.
Okay. Goodbye.
Police officer you speak with Larson.
- Mark, you speak with Sarah Turner.
Hi, Sarah. How are you?
You okay?
I think so. I hope so.
I make me a bit worried about Brian.
Brian McKinley?
- Yes.
Yes, we would meet a few hours ago meet, but he is not showing up.
We can give him as missing if only a few hours to go.
I know.
I was just wondering if you've seen him.
I have not seen him.
Eric has seen him?
His service is over.
Have you tried Mim's?
I have already phoned the bar and he is not been.
That is strange Brian.
When did you last see him?
Something for seven hours, by Sam Hunt's corn maze.
You know what? why do not you call him tomorrow...
If you still can not find him go we make some calls. Okay?
Yes, that's fine, I guess.
'm Sorry that I respond so.
That's okay. Have a good evening.
Talk to you later.
Okay, good night.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
You bother me when watching TV.
If you come now,
I call the police.
If they vote out the blonde,
I'm going to shoot someone.
Look...
I'm sorry there just.
I'm not there after.
It does not matter.
You're the one who knows how I am with relationships, so...
Do not.
I try to make my excuses.
Well, it's not so well off.
Than not.
Your love life is nothing to me.
For me go old and die alone.
Johnson's weather if you are...
I hang you up, as the ugly pig scum that you are.
This is not a game.
I'm tired...
I'm cold... and I got a gun.
I trust anyone under 30.
We have to leave.
You were always smarter than the other girls.
Let's wait a few minutes, so we know that he is gone.
I hear you.
Do not make me use it.
What was that?
Was that a gun?
No, I can not.
He would not really shoot one of us.
Maybe we should go forward,
We do not want the rest has gone before.
Wait.
Allison has the keys?
Yes, and if she is so afraid as I think, do you think they are waiting for us?
Exactly.
The keys?
The keys.
I thought Allison had the torch.
Do not touch him.
Who did this?
I do not know, but we have here really gone.
How? My necklace.
I do not know.
I gave it to Will.
Where's Will?
- I do not know.
Will has not done so.
We have to leave.
Where's Will?
Where's Allison?
Where's Colin?
- Everyone needs it shot heard.
We must from the labyrinth.
And back to the car.
Okay.
Damn.
What was that?
- I heard nothing.
I thought I heard someone.
Come on, we're almost there.
- No, I heard someone.
Jordan's go.
Do you already have coverage?
No. And we do not as long as we
In this labyrinth are.
There is just nothing.
Okay. Let's try mine.
Nothing.
Can you see something?
- Of course not, it's corn.
Yes, I know, but it feels like
We get closer.
Cole...
That was Will.
- I know.
Will if he has to address, then he too Allison.
That was her flashlight, that the old man had.
Where's Colin?
- I do not know.
He's hurt, but that guy is fast.
Can you walk?
- I do not know.
This is not the time to experiment,
So...
I can distract him...
No, do not be stupid.
We do not know what we have been in the labyrinth.
Okay, I'm going.
When the coast is clear, try to get away.
Go to the farm and use the phone.
Call the police.
Make sure they come here.
Cole, wait.
I'm sorry.
Still fun?
Where you going?
I'm not done with you.
Off with his head.
Jordan, running.
Where is the exit?
Damn.
No.
What happened?
- I killed them.
Okay, I understand.
We're ready.
Sam's corn maze is burned.
Is anyone hurt?
Until now there was only a young woman, screaming.
She comes in for questioning after they the ambulance looked at her.
Is she from here?
Joel did not recognize her, it probably comes from the city.
What do you think? Lighted or accident?
Who knows. That corn mazes are like matchboxes.
A potential slaughter.
And arson is perhaps only the beginning of the night.
What do you mean?
The girl came out, screaming, I killed them.
She was covered in blood, the ambulance said they had cut.
So you mean that murder is involved.
I do not know, but I'll go to forensic team call.
You mean Joey?
Yes, he will be excited to meet the get started.
Well, not me.
Should I call someone else?
No, let them sleep.
The province takes the matter anyway.
With the competence.
And we only know something about a murder, if they have scoured field.
And what about Sam? He is pretty good upset about his cornfield.
Yes, we have an agent sent by to knock, but he did not open.
The lights were on in the house.
Call him and ask him here past want to come.
He must ultimately a statement test.
Can I bring you somewhere?
It's cold outside.
You must be crazy... in this weather to walk.
With that coat.
It's a sweater.
You should have seen your face.
I could not see it, but...
I'm not often in the company car.
Have patience with me.
Where do you go?
Police.
I said that hard?
I do not come anymore.
Is it a night, huh?
Tell me about it.
Just kidding. Tell him not.
Better for me.
I do not want to be accomplice something that you did.
How can so much blood on her nanotubes?
There's more than just happened arson.
The province will pass to the evidence to retrieve.
We do not have the equipment to such amount of blood examination.
They do not talk to me.
Did she say anything to you?
What happened, who she killed?
I do not think we have something out of her.
Who you gonna call?
- I am Sam Hunt try again.
I think all this is worse than we think.
You must let me know where police station is.
For the last time I was there,
I was about 15 years.
I do not judge you, eh ..
Not me.
Hear that sound?
This is awkward silence.
Just kidding.
Okay, thank you.
We keep in touch.
They found two bodies.
- Sam and Brian?
They are still searching for the head of a of them.
The other body is complete, only badly burned to be identified.
I'll give you five minutes to
For answers to provide.
You know what they do with corn fields,
At the end of summer?
I recently drove by and I saw only but wheat fields... all that corn, it just stands there,
Just to rot.
You know that colorful cereal that...
You know, the primary school.
What's that again?
What now?
Come on.
Damn.
I rode too hard.
I drove too hard? No, right?
This city should always have me.
I killed my sister.
Pull over.
- He is not even registered.
Damn.
Shut up and go to the side.
Colored corn.
Yes.
Yes. Colored corn.
I drove past there last week.
You know what they do with it?
They cut away everything, absolutely everything.
They chop it fine, corn, steal, everything, absolutely everything... and they use it as fodder.
My cousin told me.
They waste nothing in this town.
They've learned from the Indians.
Sorry, Native Americans.
You know...
God, I hate this city.
So do I.
William Taylor.
Did you know him?
There was a body... headless.
Did you know that person?
Will we find more bodies?
Make sure you get a ride home.
The team spot.
You want me to pick?
No, I take him though.
Yes.
Okay, we have someone here who may have on research?
Yes, keep me informed.
They have three bodies were found.
And head.
Eric, good to see you.
It's been a terrible night.
- Tell me anything.
What?
No, I saw the fire and thought you could use some help.
The fire is just the beginning.
They found five bodies.
And the only survivors, is our only suspect.
And she does not want to talk.
Have you collected all the evidence?
Of course.
Yes.
Despite the evidence and shouted confession...
I feel that something is wrong.
Do not you think they did it?
Her cigarette lighter and its ways that she is the arsonist.
Accidentally or not, but...
I do not think that a person's head can cut off.
She knows what happened, she knows who did it, but she says nothing.
What do you want me to do?
You can guard the fort.
Marcus and I go to the field, see what else we can find.
Think you can handle it?
I am Agent Eric Schroeder.
I'll get some more evidence.
You've been through a lot tonight.
They find quite a lot of bodies out there.
They were your friends, right?
Yes.
They were.
Besides Sam Hunt the owner of the labyrinth.
He was no friend of yours, yet is also dead.
Did you kill him?
No.
Of course not.
To tell you the truth, I think you have killed nobody.
I think you and your friends... alone are guilty, in the wrong his place at the wrong time.
But, I'm just new here
In a small town.
It can be anyone here cares what I think.
I can not help you... unless you tell me exactly what happened there.
I know it's difficult.
I know.
But I gotta know what you know, so we can leave behind us.
Would you tell me what happened there?
Yes, I will.
Good.
Good.
Let's start with the first thing.
Who did you kill, or do you have to kill?
The man in the red sweater.
Is this man a name?
We have never spoken.
But you have good look at him,
You can... identify him as you would see him suspects in a row?
I do not know, it was dark.
Why were you so late in the labyrinth?
Because we arrived late and... we still wanted to see.
So you found you are trespassing?
Yes.
And you have Sam Hunt, the owner, there too?
The man with the gun?
Has he found you and your friends?
Maybe...
We played...
We got lost during each
Playing a silly game.
What do you mean...
What do you mean stupid game?
Collin.
Has a special version of Tag... and who it is...
Wearing something...
For example, a scarf or a headband.
- An ornament?
Yes.
The chain.
Like tonight.
So we got rid of each other.
And he found us.
Who won?
Pardon?
The game.
Who won the game?
I'm sorry, I do not understand.
Excuse me.
Yes, I understand, sir.
I will make sure that they completely at ease.
No.
I do not think they did it.
The evidence does not lie.
Okay.
Okay.
You can shape yourself.
They have found a body.
That's number five.
But they still have no husband found in a red coat.
I know you've killed anyone.
Help me figure out who did it.
It's all my fault.
They're all dead by me.
I've lit the grain.
The farmer shot my friend down.
Jordan, are you sure?
It's all my fault.
I will now write.
I admit in court.
I can not take it anymore.
I can not handle the guilt.
Okay.
It's okay.
You do what is right.
That's it.
Bitch.
Sample.
You killed my friends.
You got me stung several times, we are right, do not you think?
I'll kill you.
- You've done much more than that.
You have all been murdered.
With the DNA that I've left you, and you signed declaration...
I would say that you all for everything have provided.
See, I told you so.
You did not kill anyone.
You thought I would give you the gun with bullets?
You've shot with that gun, at the police station.
Lucky for me...
You can focus evil and counting.
And so...
When you brushed my leg...
I could attack you... and I shot you down.
At least that is what is
The police report will stand.
All right, fights back.
That makes it all believable.
That gun is loaded.
What do you say, after you have shot me?
I've killed your friends?
Who will you believe?
If you kill me, you go there too.
That I do not care.
I think so.
I think you're like me.
You're a survivor.
I look at anything on you.
Okay.
What do you want?
An apology.
An apology?
Really?
Keep your hands up.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
What?
- For the murder of your friends.
For the murder of Sam Hunt for the murder of Brian.
You did not know about him, but
I'm sorry anyway.
You're a monster.
You know what I regret most.
I did not kill you.
What happens here, damn.
The lights went out and they attacked me.
I could even see anything when I told her shot.
She's alive.
Call an ambulance.
What do you say after you have shot me?
I've killed your friends?
Who will you believe?
If you kill me, you go there too.
- That I do not care.
I think so.
I think you're like me.
You're a survivor.
Eric... put the gun down.
What?
Put the gun down.
Keep your hands up.
I'm sorry.
What?
- For the murder of your friends.
For the murder of Sam Hunt for the murder of Brian.
You did not know about him, but
I'm sorry anyway.
You're a monster.
You know what I regret most.
I did not kill you.

50 years ago in Scotland, one man had a brilliant idea -- an idea that today pits science detectives in Europe and America against each other in a $10 billion race to solve the riddle of what you, me, and everything around us is really made of.
It's a journey into the heart of matter, plunging into the core of our physical being and of the physical world itself.
But will this journey into the subatomic Universe revolutionize our understanding of nature, or will it reveal just how little we really know about who we are and what we're made of?
Space, time, life itself.
The secrets of the cosmos lie through the wormhole.
<font color=#7fff00>♪ Through the Wormhole 1x07 ♪</font>
<font color=#ffff00>What Are We Really Made Of?</font>

What are we really made of -- you, me, everything around us?
That simple question has kept people guessing for thousands of years.
In ancient times, the answer was easy -- everything in creation was made from one or more of the four elements --
Earth...
Air...
Fire... and Water.
When I was a kid, in not quite so ancient times, we were told that everything is made out of atoms.
But in the last few decades, scientists have looked inside the atom and found that things are a lot more complicated.
Despite all of our knowledge, we still don't understand the true nature of matter.
But right now, thousands of investigators are following hunches, tracking down suspects, and getting closer than ever to learning how we and everything around us fits together.
And they're doing it by breaking things apart.
When I was 6 years old, my father gave me his old pocket watch -- a time keeper.
"How does this work?"
I wondered.
I decided to find out.
Taking it apart was a lot easier than putting it back together, but I learned a little about what makes things tick.
And that's pretty much what particle physicists do today.
They smash things up and look at the debris through extremely powerful microscopes.
We do what kids do.
We smash things, and we look to see what comes out.
And so, to do that, we need to smash things harder and harder and harder to see what's smaller and smaller and smaller.
At Chicago's
Argon National Laboratory,
Bob Stanek builds machines that peer into the subatomic world.
So, this is our advanced photon source -- a microscope that's about a half a mile around, and it contains 33 stations where 33 individual experiments can go on measuring tiny structures of whatever these guys feel happy measuring.
If you remember way back in High School, when you looked through the microscope and you said, "wow, look at all that stuff -- how neat it is," it's amazing that ordinary light and optics can bring you to such a detailed level.
However, for a lot of things nowadays, you need more than just that ordinary light.
You need to get smaller and smaller and smaller.
With the A.P.S., we can see things much smaller than we could see with our standard microscope.
We could see things a factor of 10 smaller, a factor of 1,000 smaller, a factor of 10,000 smaller.
In fact, we can see things that are 10 to the 10th smaller than what we could see with ordinary light.
We can see molecules.
We can see viruses.
We can almost see the structur of life.
The ability to take pictures of molecules and atoms is an incredible thing, because only 100 years ago, the atom was just a theory.
At the dawn of the 20th century, it was believed that if atoms existed at all, they were either empty shells or solid little balls.
Then one investigation changed everything.
It was the brainchild of Ernest Rutherford, the Sherlock Holmes of particle physics.
Steve Nahn is a Professor at M.I.T. and a team leader on the world's biggest Particle Accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider in Europe.
Steve is going to reproduce one of the most important experiments in the history of science --
Rutherford's probe into the structure of the atom.
This experiment is the same as Rutherford's experiment.
We use the same kind of gold foils and send millions of particles through these gold foils.
Rutherford thought that all the particles would essentially go straight through and not deflect at all, but that's not what happened.
The Rutherford experiment is like firing bullets at a haystack.
The particle are like bullets, and the atoms in the gold foil are like haystacks.
If the haystack is empty, the bullets go straight through.
If the haystack is packed with cannonballs, all the bullets bounce back.
If there are a few cannonballs
in the center,
some of the bullets will bounce back.
And that's what happened.
When Rutherford fired his particles, most went straight through, but some sharply bounced back from the center of the target, upending the conceived wisdom of the time.
Something small and hard was down in there, deep inside the Shell of the atom.
This is the evidence for a very heavy, very small object at the core of the atom -- the high-density nucleus surrounded by a vastness of empty space.
In fact, the nucleus of an atom is 100,000 times smaller than its radius.
It's equivalent to the head of a pin in the middle of a football stadium.
After Rutherford, physicists probed further into the atom.
They found that it is built out of three parts -- the protons and neutrons that form the nucleus and the electrons that form the Shell around it.
Between them, they make up atoms.
Atoms stick together and form molecules.
Out of the molecules, we get more complex shapes, from a strand of DNA...
...Up to the 7,000 trillion, trillion atoms that form a human body.
For a time, the atomic theory of the Universe seemed to explain most everything, but then physicists started breaking atoms apart, and they discovered a slew of mysterious new particles that turned their theories upside down.
The most frightening was called antimatter -- matter's evil twin.
If just this much touches ordinary matter, it will level a city.
So, why are scientists trying so hard to make it?
Turns out it may hold the secret to the mystery of matter.
When scientists first smashed atoms apart, they uncovered their essential building blocks -- protons, neutrons, and electrons.
Next, they built machines that let them smash these tiny pieces together, and out came strange, new particles.
Perhaps the strangest is the stuff we call antimatter -- matter's polar opposite.
It's the most explosive substance in the Universe.
When matter and antimatter touch, they violently cancel each other out.
Physicists say, they annihilate each other.
It triggers an enormous explosion.
How big of an explosion?
Less than half a gram of antimatter rice would produce a 13-kiloton blast as big as the Hiroshima bomb.
Professor Frank Close is a theoretical physicist at Oxford University.
Antimatter is a perfect opposite to matter.
If I was made of antimatter,
I would look exactly the same as I do today.
If you looked at the atoms that I'm made of, they would look exactly the same if I was made of antiatoms.
It's only when you get inside the atoms that you see the difference.
That's the atoms that we're made of have little negatively charged electrons whirling around a big, bulky, positive nucleus.
And the antiatoms?
Ask this man --
Joel Fajans, an antimatter investigator at the University of California, Berkeley.
Antimatter is everywhere in the Universe.
For instance, this banana contains potassium 40, an isotope of potassium which emits positrons.
Positrons and other forms of antimatter are difficult to study, however, and that's my job.
That's what I do, is to study antimatter.
I was partially inspired to do this by this experiment over here -- the Bevatron Accelerator at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory.
The Bevatron was the first giant Particle Accelerator.
It's being torn apart now, but back in the '50s, it was the center of the world for physics research.
The same techniques that were used in the Bevatron to accelerate particles are now used in the enormous
Particle Accelerators that are throughout the world.
Particle Accelerators are like giant microscopes that let us peer into the subatomic world.
They break matter down into its smallest components.
Drilling down far enough to detect antimatter requires taking protons from an atom's nucleus, trapping them in a vacuum, then shooting them into a ring of giant electromagnets.
So, a Particle Accelerator works by starting protons going around in a circle in a ring.
And every time they go around, you give them a little kick with an electric field so they get going faster and faster and faster and faster...
And faster until they're almost at the speed of light.
Well, they're going almost the speed of light in a real particle collider, but here they're not going that fast...
Yet.
So, protons in this direction...
Interact with protons in this direction, and at some point, they come like a car crashing together.
And you can imagine what happens when a car crashes together.
Pieces fly all over, and around that interaction point where the cars crashed together is where we have our detector.
So, and this happens, millions and millions and millions of times every second.
When you break protons apart, you release incredible amounts of energy.
Strange things come out of the explosions, including tiny particles that flare into existence and disappear in billionths of a second -- particles like the antineutron and the antimatter version of the proton.
Theorists had predicted they existed in the 1920s.
Decades later, the Bevatron proved they were right.
Suddenly, the world we thought we knew got a whole lot stranger.
Positrons from things like radioactive decays like in the banana or cosmic rays form one half of an antimatter Universe.
Antiprotons from machines like this and from cosmic rays and other natural sources form another half of an antimatter Universe.
Put them together, and you've got a complete antimatter mirror Universe which just looks like ours except everything is backwards, everything is mirrored together.
And that's a little bit surprising, shocking maybe, because matter Universes and antimatter Universes aren't very compatible with each other, because when you put them together, when they touch, they annihilate or blow up.
So, how did we come to be here?
Because if there is just as much matter as antimatter in the Universe, it should have all combined together and left us with absolutely nothing.
The tiny bursts of light you see here are antimatter electrons or positrons.
When they leak out of this small radioactive disk, they hit the oppositely charged electrons of the normal matter in the chamber and instantly annihilate, creating these flashes of energy.
Positrons and electrons are the smallest particles imaginable, so the fact that you can see them explode with the naked eye gives you a hint of how much energy is being released.
Antimatter is the ultimate high explosive.
Some worry that, in the wrong hands, it could be used to create an antimatter bomb -- the ultimate super weapon.
There's no way we're going to destroy the Earth using antimatter here.
It's absolutely impossible to get a large amount of antimatter around simply on the basis of economics.
If you wanted to make even a couple of grams of antimatter, you'd have to run this facility for, in fact, thousands, if not tens of thousands of years to make even a few grams of antimatter.
And this is a fundamental physics issue.
This isn't an efficiency issue.
It's not as if we're going to get much better at this than we currently are at it.
So you can relax.
The world is safe.
Antimatter is what we're not made of.
But the fact that it exists at all reveals how alien the Universe really is and how little we understand the cosmic forces at work in the heavens and deep inside our own bodies.
The discovery of antimatter was followed by deeper probing into the heart of the atom on larger, more powerful
Particle Accelerators.
But physicists didn't like what they saw.
The closer they looked, the less things made sense.
The accelerators exposed a bewildering array of mysterious particles -- dozens of strains, pieces of matter, all seemingly different.
Some were incredibly heavy.
Some had no weight at all.
The subatomic world earned the nickname "The Particle Zoo."
When we were learning about the zoo of particles that were not defined, it was pretty chaotic, and it just didn't look right.
You're thinking,
"this is bull crap.
There's got to be something better than this."
'Cause this is just all, you know, like, just categorizing stuff, black magic, and people just didn't know what they were doing.
Physics is a quest for simplicity.
This was chaos.
Why?
To help crack this mystery in the 1970s, the United States built Fermilab, a high-energy research facility
30 miles outside of Chicago.
Fermilab sits on top of the Tevatron, a four-mile-long
Particle Accelerator.
Nobel-prize-winning experimental physicist Leon Lederman conducted many of his experiments here.
But for decades, he groped in the dark like everyone else, trying to make sense of the messiness of the quantum world.
Little by little, more and more particles got fed into the hopper till there were a couple of hundred particles as, you know, in the 1950s,
'60s, and '70s, and then people started organizing these particles into family groups, and out of this, late '70s, early '80s, came the organization called a Standard Model.
But it was a gradual process, and it's like a jigsaw puzzle.
You got the right piece, and everything fell together, and there was the painting on the box cover.
After studying thousands of these jigsaw puzzles, physicists began to understand what they were looking at.
Rob Roser runs the giant detector th takes pictures of matter and antimatter collisions inside the Tevatron.
Behind me is an event display of a proton-antiproton collision occurring inside the CDF detector.
You can imagine a proton coming from one direction in and out of the screen and colliding at the center point.
And so by looking at the bend or curvature of the particle, if it's curved in one direction, that particle's positively charged.
If it's bent in an opposite direction, that particle is negatively charged.
So, if we just break this event down, you can see a single long pink object pointing to a big pink cluster.
The more the color, the more energy that particle has.
So you can see, here is the single particle that gave up a bunch of energy right in the initial part of the calorimeter.
That's indicative of an electron.
Over here, you see a single line that's giving up energy in the back half of the detector, more characteristic of what a muon object would look like, a muon being a heavy electron.
So we can start to get a lot of information by just looking at a couple of very simplistic ideas in terms of where the particles traveled, how much they curve, and where they deposited energy in the detector.
Today, after years of reading these subatomic tea leaves, physicists feel they are getting closer to answering the question,
"what are we really made of?"
The stuff that we are made of today only requires maybe a handful of little particles -- the atoms on the outside are electrons whirling around like planets, if you like.
There's a nucleus in the middle of the atom which we used to believe was made of protons and neutrons.
Well, it is, but deeper down, they, in turn, like going to the heart of the cosmic onion, are made of little things called quarks.
And two types of quarks -- an up quark and a down quark.
And that's it.
An up and a down quark joined together in different ways ultimately make the atomic nucleus.
An electron whirling around the outside make the atom.
Throw in a neutrino, which is created in radioactive processes, and that's the basic particles that make up everything that you see around you.
There's also the photon of light, which we are seeing with right now, and that pretty well is it.
Most of the atoms in our body are made of nuclei and electrons, and the nuclei themselves are made of protons and neutrons, and the protons and neutrons are made of quarks.
And, of course, you say,
"what are the quarks made of?"
And that's where we're stuck.
For the last 40, 50 years, we've been studying the quarks, trying to find something inside, and we get the same results we had for the electron.
There's nothing inside.
The quarks don't have any size.
The size, the radius of a quark is zero.
It's a little bit like
"Alice in Wonderland."
Remember when Alice saw the Cheshire cat sitting on the branch of a tree with a big smile?
And much to Alice's great astonishment, right in front of her eyes, the Cheshire cat started to disappear, and finally -- poof! --
It was gone.
But it left behind one component -- its smile.
That quark smile is a tiny box stuffed full of energy.
All matter is actually made of energy that has congealed into particulate form.
So that appears to be what we are made of -- at least as far as we can see right now.
But knowing this opens up an even greater mystery, which is -- why does the stuff we are made of behave the way it does?
Our explorations of matter reveal that everything is nearly hollow -- you, me, and everything in the Universe.
It's all an empty space with a few pinpricks of matter floating in a void like rocks adrift in the vastness of space.
But how do these pinpricks of matter form into shapes and structures?
There must be something holding it together -- some sort of glue in the ocean of emptiness.
The question is, what?
Today, we think we know what we're made out of -- the incredibly small building blocks that form all the matter in the Universe.
But finding these bits and pieces of matter revealed another even more challenging mystery -- why are things solid?
Why do they have mass?
Matter is mostly eupty space.
Every now and then, you find the point of an atom, but most of the time, it's empty space.
So, that point of atom and that point of atom and so on -- how are they held together?
How are you held together?
How am I held together?
It's not glue.
You know it's not glue.
It has to be some exchange of fundamental properties.
That exchange of forces has to happen -- even though you don't see it -- has to happen at the global level everywhere.
Empty space isn't empty at all.
It's filled with forces.
When these men toss this basketball back and forth, they're transferring the momentum of the ball from one to the other, which pushes them apart -- a complex exchange of invisible forces talking to each other.
So, there are four fundamental forces -- the gravitation force that everybody knows about, the electromagnetic force, which mostly everybody knows about, the weak force, which you don't know about, and the strong force, which you don't know about.
The weak force is what determines radioactive decay.
How uranium decays into whatever it decays into -- that's governed by the weak forces.
The strong forces are what holds the proton together, what holds the quarks into three pieces that form a proton.
So, us guys are doing the weak forces and the strong forces, and what we don't understand is the gravitational force, and we think we understand the electromagnetic force.
Just as we can't see the things we're made of, we can't see the fundamental forces around us.
But we know they're there.
Finding out how these forces work and where they came from in the first place is the great quest of modern physics.
Solving this mystery could reveal the Universe's most closely held secrets -- not just what we're made of, but why the stuff inside us holds its shape.
The key breakthrough in particle physics was the discovery that certain particles are actually force carriers.
For instance, photons -- particles of light -- carry the electromagnetic force.
All the forces have these carriers.
We haven't found them all yet, but we've found enough to know they're there.
And we know enough about how they interact to realize that at extremely high temperatures -- around a million, billion degrees -- the electromagnetic and the weak force begin to merge.
This merging is called electroweak unification.
You don't have to understand it -- I certainly don't -- but to physicists, it was like finding the missing link.
It led the way to one of the most successful theories in the history of science -- the Standard Model of particle physics.
It's been proving correct again and again over the last 40 years.
But there is a problem with the Standard Model --
A big problem.
And it goes back to The Particle Zoo -- strange particles that turn up when you smash together protons to see what's inside.
Subatomic particles have a huge range of weight, or mass.
For instance, one point-blank quark can weigh 200 times more than the point-blank electron, and these particles have even heavier cousins weighing 100,000 times more.
The Standard Model cannot explain why there is such a wild range of masses or even why particles have any mass at all.
Fixing this problem became the next great quest of modern physics.
Salvation came in the unlikely form of this man.
Meet Peter Higgs, an unassuming Professor who set off one of the largest and most expensive investigations in the history of science.
There was a gapping hole in the
Standard Model of the Universe.
Peter Higgs put a plug in it.
Higgs theorized that a vast field stretching to infinity runs through everything.
When certain kinds of particles interact with the field, that interaction is what gives those particles mass.
If Higgs' theory becomes fact, we may finally understand why things are solid.
But at first, Higgs had trouble getting his theory accepted.
A paper outlining the idea was rejected by CERN.
I was indignant, because I thought what I'd done had possibly important consequences.
So I rewrote the paper by adding on some extra paragraphs, and instead of sending it back to Geneva, where I thought the people at CERN didn't understand what I was talking about,
I sent it across the Atlantic to Physical Review Letters, the corresponding
American journal, and it was accepted.
The paragraphs Higgs added predicted that the mass-giving field would have a matching particle, a force carrier called a Higgs Boson.
And this matching particle could theoretically be created in a Particle Accelerator.
Gradually, experimental physicists became excited by Higgs' idea.
What happens with a theory is, of course, a small number of theorists push this idea.
They love it.
And little by little, more and more theorists climb on board, you know?
It's like the train.
"Whoo Whoo!"
We're gone, and we're taking off from the station.
In one of the great ironies of modern science,
CERN, the organization that rejected Higgs' paper, has just spent $10 billion building a machine to find the Higgs particle.
But what exactly is the Higgs?
Ask a half dozen physicists, and you'll get a half dozen different answers.
The Higgs.
It's a tricky thing to come up with an analogy for Higgs Bosons.
It's -- there's the analogy with something being dragged through treacle, but for me, that's misleading, because this is a dissipation of energy, and it isn't like that.
That's a pretty bad analogy for the Higgs.
What I've read on the Higgs is, in my mind, very confusing.
Here's the way I understand it.
A bunch of reporters standing in a room, crowded room.
And so me and President Obama want to make it from the entrance of this room to the exit of this room.
So we go in, and what happens?
Of course, all the reporters glom on Mr. Obama.
And old Bob over here, he just makes a beeline right to the exit door.
So, basically, with no inertia,
I can make it to that door, whereas Mr. Obama has a lot of inertia, a lot of mass.
So this Higgs field affects one particle more so than another particle.
Must be able to come up with a more -- well, when we see what they look like, we'll come up with a better analogy.
Another analogy, yeah.
Something involving cars or something.
I don't know.
However you describe it, the Higgs solves a slew of problems, starting with The Particle Zoo.
It's a very elegant idea, because if you accept it, then our whole picture of particles becomes simpler.
There are not so many particles.
It's the mass that makes it look as if there are many particles.
A little bit like a kaleidoscope, where you look in with a lot of mirrors, and there's only one little pattern, but it's reflected and reflected in mirrors, and it looks very complicated.
The Higgs phenomenon is a very satisfying way of simplifying our Standard Model.
The Higgs gives mass to the basic seeds of matter, such as the electron and atoms and the quarks inside protons.
Because the mass of the electron helps determine the size of the atom, the Higgs gives structure and form to everything we know.
If you turned it off, you, me, your dog, and the planet would fly apart at the speed of light.
So, how do you find an invisible, seemingly undetectable force of nature?
All the forces have related particles that we can see, given enough energy.
With the right tool, we can create those force particles, although as it turns out, it's taken nearly 50 years to develop a tool that may spot the Higgs.
This is CERN's
Large Hadron Collider.
At full power, it can channel
7 trillion electron volts, making it by far the highest energy particle accelerator ever made.
The higher energy levels of the
LHC produced bigger collisions that spurt out more massive particles.
This raises the odds that out of the billions of collisions produced each second, the LHC will find things humans have never seen before -- things like the Higgs.
But the LHC will do much more than find a tiny particle, because what they've really built at CERN is a Big-Bang machine.
While trying to solve the mystery of matter, physicists realized that they're on the trail of a much bigger mystery -- perhaps the ultimate mystery.
What happened in the first moments of creation?
Right now, thousands of science detectives hunt the Higgs Boson -- the elusive particle that gives everything mass, the thing that may keep matter glued together.
The mystery they are trying to solve is much, much bigger than anyone first imagined.
To solve it, they have to go back to the beginning and re-create the first moments of the Universe.
In the first moments just after the big bang happened, it was incredibly hot -- billions of billions of degrees.
And heat is energy.
And the energy congealed into forms of matter, many of which we have already discovered, many of which we only believe exist because of our equations.
Most of these things only lived for a trillionth of a second themself.
They were made, they died away and left children, grandchildren, and so forth.
This cascading down from these ephemeral particles into the stable stuff took place very quickly.
The stable stuff then ends up congealing to make the stuff that you and I and everybody's made of today.
So, what we're doing is re-creating in the lab the first moments of the Universe, and then by surrounding the site of the collisions with these special cameras, detectors, we can record what happened.
And so we are simulating just after the big bang, making mini bangs, if you like, in the lab.
And from what we find there, we begin to get a sense of how matter, the stuff that we ultimately,
15 billion years later, are made of, first came to be.
Jon Butterworth is a physicist at the University College of London.
Adam Davison is a postdoctoral student.
They're two of the 6,000 scientists conducting experiments back at CERN, the European organization for nuclear research.
CERN itself is quite -- yeah, is not terribly pretty.
It looks like someone dropped a load of rusty bricks on the ground.
I get the impression that there was never much of an architectural plan for CERN.
Until you go underground, of course, and then it's like something out of a James Bond villain set.
This, as a piece of engineering, is a miracle.
It is the pyramids of our time.
The heart of CERN is the Large Hadron Collider, a $10 billion, 17-mile-long
Particle Accelerator.
It is quite possibly the most sophisticated scientific instrument ever built.
The LHC creates the primordial explosions, then four enormous detectors along the accelerator ring take pictures of the collisions.
The two largest detectors are called Atlas and CMS.
M.I.T.'S Steve Nahn leads a team that helped design and now runs the CMS detector.
We build our detectors to take pictures of the events which happen once every 25 nanoseconds.
That's 40 million times a second we have an interaction that we want to take a picture of.
And our detector is made out of several different cameras.
You could think of it as having, like, an X-ray camera and an infrared camera and an ultraviolet camera and a regular photo camera all at the same time taking pictures of different aspects of the event.
So, with this terabytes and terabytes of data on disk, we have to write algorithms which sift through and find that event, that one in 10 million, one in 100 million, one in a billion event that you're looking for.
On the other side of the LHC,
Butterworth and Davison have developed a way to comb through the enormous amounts of data generated by CMS's archrival, the Atlas detector.
The two men are trying to create maps of what they think the subatomic
Universe looked like just seconds after its creation, then matching their imaginary maps up to reality.
Somewhere in there, they hope they'll find the Higgs.
It's kind of like a border around an unknown country.
And we know that it's there.
We've had experiments that have gone to high enough energy to tell us there is a border and there is a land beyond it, but we've not had really much of a glimpse of the land.
So, the LHC really is gonna let us over that border and let us have a look at this land and survey it and see.
And this is why people, when people ask, you know, what we're gonna find,
"when are you gonna get your nobel prize?"
We just don't know.
We know that if the Higgs exists, it will be in that country somewhere, and our kit is good enough to find it.
It might take a few years, but we'll find it.
Meanwhile, back in America,
Fermilab hasn't given up.
It's a race against the clock to find the Higgs before CERN's LHC powers up.
Of course, we're here in Chicago, and we'd love to have that machine in Chicago.
So we look at the success of our European colleagues with mixed feelings.
It's a little bit like watching your mother-in-law drive off a cliff in your BMW.
September 2008.
The physics world holds its collective breath as the LHC powers up for the first time.
The first low-powered beams shoot through the 17-mile ring, and all is well.
They're ready to tear the veil off the Universe and try to catch sight of the Higgs.
Now they raise the power -- one more notch on the way up to 7 trillion volts.
And then...
...The LHC explodes.
September 2008.
Explosions rip through the 17-mile-long tunnel housing the Large
Hadron Collider,
Europe's Big-Bang machine.
An enormous blast destroys hundreds of the superconducting magnets that shoot protons through the accelerator.
It was pretty dramatic.
Yeah, absolutely.
It took a year to fix.
It must have been quite an electrical arc to melt through the -- imagine the face of the guy who opened the door to the tunnel.
Yeah, I can imagine waiting to get in there right then.
He must have been really, really nervous to see what had happened.
You know, it was desperately disappointing for everyone involved.
As CERN rebuilds its broken magnets,
Fermilab's Tevatron steps up the pace.
But they don't see the Higgs.
This means that the Higgs particle, the force carrier that allows matter to clump together, has a high mass, and the higher the mass, the more outside energy it takes to crack it open.
At this point, Fermilab just can't generate enough energy.
December 2009.
CERN's LHC restarts.
Within weeks, it powers up well past Fermilab's capacity.
Eventually, it will be
7 times more powerful.
With both machines running, the Higgs particle could be found in the next few years, unless everyone's secret fear comes true -- what if it's not there at all?
What if the Standard Model is wrong and the Higgs doesn't exist?
If it turns out that the experimental evidence is strongly that there is no such thing, then I'm simply baffled, because it means that a great deal of physics, which I think I now understand,
I would no longer understand.
If the Higgs theory is wrong, of course, many theoretical physicists will jump out of second-floor windows.
That's about as high as they go.
Nature knows how it works.
Soon we will know how it works.
We have our ideas on how it works, which may be proved correct.
They may be proved wrong.
Whichever it is, we will learn.
If you're asking me to place my bets,
I think that something like the Higgs Boson is out there, waiting to be discovered.
What would be more exciting is, in fact, we find things that we don't understand.
So, we understand that the Higgs is gonna be there, and so we find it, so, hurray, hurray.
Now what do we do?
But if you find something you don't understand, well, now people have a job.
My job every day is to go to work and understand things that I don' understand.
If I have more stuff to no understand, that's job security.
So, what are we really made of?
Dig deep inside the atom, and you will find tiny particles held together by invisible forces in a sea of empty space.
Dig even further, and we discover that everything is made up of tiny packets of energy born in cosmic furnaces.
This energy that cools down gets dragged through a mysterious force named the Higgs and clumps together, forming all the things we call matter.
It has an evil twin called antimatter, but most of that has long since disappeared.
As we get closer to re-creating the heat of the big bang in our accelerators, we get closer to understanding how and why all this happened.
Perhaps some day not long from now, we'll finally solve the last remaining riddles of matter and fully comprehend the inner workings of creation.

I read your article.
- Article?
More like a blurt if you ask me.
It was well written.
- Spare me your sympathy Marcus.
Come on Carmen.
How long you gonna be bitter about your work. its bullshit. i write one Controversial article and im pushed down to the bottom of the food chain. you probably shoulda left it alone, you knew it was gonna get you in trouble. can we just stop talking about this please? ok , well what do you want to talk about? maybe the fact that half the time you spend with me, your typing on the phone? or that you break our plans after we make them? cos im good with iether wheres this coming from? forget about it, im gonna get going. no! Seriously, what is this
You think that this is fun for me? it seems liek everytime we hang out, your mind is somewhere else.
I am swamped with work right now marcus, you know that. yeah so am i, but i turn it off when im with you. you gotta give a little.
- oh so now im selfish?
Yeah, kinda.
- ok, i think thats enough.
Yeah, I think it is, im outa here. marcus..
Bees?
- Yeah, bees.
A farmer in orchid medow, Omaha caims that non of the bees do not return to the hive and only 20% of the crop is being pollinated.
Why dont we try something else ive got a lead on the Eric Taylor case. look .. a young man goes back packing across Europe and goes missing, it happens all the time. its a dead case.
- No, there's more to it than that.
He was last seen leaving a motel in Kozki, Poland.
Sara and I have have been doing some research. we found record of 5 tourists who have gone missing during the last 50 years, while travelling through the exact same area.
Carmen, how many times do i have to tell you?
Listen ok , the strange thing is that shortly after they disappear ... their luggage shows up at random cities all over eastern Europe. now i spoke to Laura Taylor,
Eric's mom ... she recently received a call from prague airport saying they had erics luggage. theres no record of him ever entering the Czech Republic. that doesn't sound like fresh concrete evidence to me.
Have you ever been to an airport?
Luggage gets lost all the time.
Not interested.
And Carmen
I do not want you and sarah wasting company time, with this misisng person stuff. are we clear?
Hello.
- Hi mrs. Taylor.
I'm Carmen Berk.
- Carmen,its so  nice to finally meet you,please, call me Laura.
This is Sara Titasal, she is an intern at our company.
Hello Laura.
- its a pleasure, please come in.
Eric had been planning his trip for over a year.
He was.. never much into school.
He always just wanted to travel. and where are the police with this now? its an absolute joke. i contacted theKoski police, they say they found nothing.
I contacted the police here ... and after waiting days for them to get back to me ... they call and tell me that eric is now officially on a missing persons list. and that his case has been moved to a different department.
You mentioned you've been contacted about erics luggage, have you been able to claim it yet?
Yes, it's upstairs in his room.
All his clothes are there, his books, his journal, his hotel receipts. di you tell the police that? i mean, there could be evidence. yes Of course, I called them right away.
They told me that they were too backed up to come.
That they would get to it, when they could. would it be ok if i take a look at erics luggage? there may something there that may help us.
Yes, ofcourse, please. will you forgive me if i dont escort u up
I find it difficult to be in that room.
- I understand. thank you
It's upstairs on the right.
I'll make some tea.
- ill help you.
That was Eric and his cousin, when they decided they wanted to get tattoos.
I told them they were crazy, but ...
Eric really wanted one.
Is this your husband?
- Yeah, that's my Jim.
He passed away five years ago.
I'm sorry.
- it hurt eric alot.
Laura , can i borrow this for the time being? its erics journal. but id really love to spend some more time with it
I don't see why not.
I don't imagine the police will want it any time soon.
Thank you for your time.
The last journal entry..
Alvainia.
Leave me alone. look I hate fighting with you. well obviously were fighting for a reason.
- I know. And I agree. my head hasn't been in this relationship lately.
But I want to fix that. which is why i think you should come on this trip with me.
I appreciate that.
But if were going to take a trip together, why dont we go to the Cayman Islands or something?
Because there is no story in the Cayman Islands. right..right.
- Come on Marcus.
I think your a great photographer and
I want you to shoot this. tell you what, Ill leave my
BlackBerry in the hotel.
I do not know, Carmen it sounds a little dangerous. could be.
- I'm not kidding. im surprised that Dale would even allow this, this sounds like a police matter.
Yeah, well the police aint doing shit.
I'm going no matter what. i have to, ive already booked the tickets just think about it alright.
I gotta get back. heres the contact info for Carl Pierson, hes the farmer with the dying crops. theres another farm house just east of him with the same problem.
These bees are literaly just dying off.
Anyway.
He looks forward to meeting the two of you. this should be a good experience for you Sarah. are you excited?
Yeah..very excited.
Well. Keep up the good work girls. Rock and Roll.
- Rock and Roll. marcus
Yeah? Okay, great.
Oh no, we should have everything prept soon.
No we'll break up the details later.
I'm really glad your doing this. ok talk to you soon bye.
Okay, were good to go.
Marcus is gonna shoot for us.
Listen, I want you to start checking out motels in Poland start with the one Eric was staying at in Kozki. alright
I can not believe were doing this.
Were gonna have to start brushing up on our Polish.
- already a step ahead of you. so, what else we know about this place.
Not much.
They make their own clothes, they grow their own food. apparently the lands known for growing mushroooms. it doesnt look like eric was in  Alvainia for very long, theres only a few journal entries.
Hey listen to this one. theres something odd about this village, the people seem very odd and distant.
There are no motels or hostels, so im roughing it in an old barn. ive noticed some kind of smoke looming above the tree line on the outer edge of the village. i thought it was a fire at first, but it actually seems to be more like a fog, just sitting there. was this kid eating the mushrooms by any chance?
That must be the turn up ahead. well.. i guess were here. pull over here, well walk.
Eric wasn't kidding about this place.
Oh my God, thats sick.
Come on, hes just a farmer. need i remind you where hot dogs come from?
You said they teach English i school here right?
- Yeah thats what i read.
Hi there. Those are beautiful.
Do you speak English?
Yes.. little.
My name is Carmen, thats marcus, and sarah.
What's your name?
- Lidia.
Lidia, thats a very pretty name.
Thank you.
We are journalists from America.
Do you know America?
Yes, cheeseburgers.
Yes, cheeseburgers.
Have you ever travelled outside
Alvainia, Lidia?
No, not allowed.
Thats too bad.
Do you like it here?
No? how come? listen Lidia, we're looking for a young man, his names Eric Taylor, have you seen him?
You have to go.
- Have you seen this man Lidia?
Let's keep moving.
Is this town Christian ?
I do not know, it seems really strange tho. look at that guy, there treating him like roaylty. holy shit.. speaking of strange.
That's it, thats gotta be what
Eric was talking about. well how can that be? its still here.
What the hell is it?
Im not sure, but its the last thing he wrote about in his journal. i say we check it out. i dont understand how it can just be sitting there, in that one part of the forest?
I can see why Eric was intrigued.
I'm sorry,do you speak English?
- You, go.
We are looking for someone, maybe you can help us. get your hands off me hey!!
English yeah? You are English? so go to England.
Go. alright, were going.
Relax.
There is nothing for you here English.
Pull over Marcus.
- What? Why? just pull over for a minute
We have to go back.
- what, are you kidding me?
Those guys looked like they wanted to kill us.
There hiding something up there in that forest.
No, they wanted us out of there the minute we got into town.
No, that guy followed us half way round the village it wasnt till we started walking towards the fog that he came after us. that was the one place they wouldnt let us go and the last place eric may have been. you dont think thats a major coincidence?
Carmen , we cant.
We have to.
- Why? because if we dont.. my career is done.
Dale does not even know we're here, he thinks we are in Omaha covering some bullshit story. if i go back empty handed im finished
Are you fuckin serious?
You never got a go ahead?
Wait ... you didnt tell him? hold on a sec.. you knew about this too? look, there hiding something up there in those trees and i want to find out what it is.
We came all this way, we cant just turn back now.
Please Marcus, I need this.
We check it out and thats it. ok
You should have known better, than to get her mixed up in this. she wanted to be here here.
- She's not your kid.
It should be straight ahead from here, im pretty sure the church is off that way.
Yeah this feels right.
This is so strange.
Hows it not moving?
It's so dense.
It's too dense.
- What do you mean.
I can take a photo of what ever this is from here, but theres no way i can get a decent shot its so foggy lets head in, check it out.
- What difference does it make carmen? we cant shoot what we cant see. we didnt come all the way up here so we could take a picture of some cloud sitting in a forrest marcus not exactly the story im looking for. yeah well the story your looking for is gonna get us caught.
Oh my god , would you stop worrying, no one even knows were here.
Yeah, no one in the whole fuckin world knows were here.
Jesus Carmen.
Ok what the hell where is she? i dont know, but we should definetly be getting the fuck out of here.
Were not just gonna leave her here Marcus.
- i didnt say that. alright, wait here, Ill go see what's going on. hold on.ill go check it out
No Marcus i brought us here.ill go
Be careful.
What happened?
Where is Carmen?
- She is looking for you.
Carmen, she's here. carmen..are you alright are you hurt? hey..are you hurt?
No, im alright.
We should go.
What did you see?
I saw a statue.
Yeah, i saw it too. lets talk about this on the way back to the car. carmen, leave it alone lets just go.
Lidia, what are you doing here?
I know where your friend is. you know where Eric Taylor is? yes - i show you you
Come, follow.
I really think that we need to get out of here.
We going come on.
In there. in here.
Oh my God.
Jesus.
Ok guys, Eric has to be in one of these. here gimme a hand. its Eric. yeah thats not coming off. it feels like its attached in the centre somewhere
That symbol, its the same one from the church
Lidia, what have they done to him, whys he wearing...
She's gone.
She locked us in.
- What? Why would she do that?
Probably cos it was part of her fucking plan carmen well Can you get us out?
There's somebody down here. i got it, come on.
- Let's go.
We should go.
- yeah no shit, but wheres the car from here? lets head back this way. hey,you ok? yeah there was a bit of path up here, we just gotta find it.
Wait, stop. oh fuck!..lets go. come on
Wait..wait, marcus hold on we cant stop here. where are we even going? i dont know, but not here.
- Can you run?..in a sec we cant stay out in the open come on, go to that barn come on!
Come on,get inside. can You see them? marcus? no just keep quiet
We never should have come here carmen. this whole fucking thing was a mistake
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault,
I shouldnt have been so selfish i just wanted a good story
Please Marcus please, im so sorry for everything.
Oh my God. lets get out of here go sarah..hurry
Come on.
Wait here.
Sara, Im right here.
What have you done?
Marcus Wait.
No,no,no we have to keep moving
Do not touch me.
We need a car. were gonna go to that farmhouse were gonna get a vehicle and where gonna get the hell out of here you dont have to run any more ok? lets go.
Come on. i have to get the keys, im gonna go inside.. you wait here
No, Im comin with you.
Stay behind me. im not gonna hurt you
I need your truck, I need the keys to the truck.
Calm down, we just need your keys.
I dont wanna hurt anyone you just give us the keys, and we will leave the keys, where are they? relax.
Dont move.
Who else is in the house?
Shut up. in the other room..now !!
English, you speak English?
He say you must leave.
Where are the keys to the truck?
- I do not know.
Ask your father where they are, or im gonna pull this trigger. he needs to tell me now i am not fucking kidding
The kitchen, there in the kitchen.
Come, I'll show you. alright, lets go
I'm sorry, but i have to.
Please, the woman , she is evil, she has seen the statue please are you alright?
I have tasted the blood and flesh of fallen angels.
There is no redemption.
Your men are weak.
Help me Marcus.
He will take you where you need to go what is it up there? in the trees this is curse left here on our land from long ago
It can not be undone. created by sub-stance feel free to upload to any sites you wish
'911. What's your emergency?'
My son's been kidnapped.
There was a guy in a...
...in a pickup truck.
A white rusted out pickup truck with a camper shell on the back.
- 'What's your son's name, sir?'
- Benjamin. Benjamin Landry.
Fuck! Fuck!
What's going on?
What's going on? Where is he?
Excuse me.
I'm Detective Berger.
I was talking to your husband about your son's kidnapping.
Mrs Landry, can you sit down and talk?
Where's my son?
I want him back!
- We're going to find him, OK?
- Oh, God!
I just overheard two cops talking about how unusual it is for a child to be abducted in the parent's plain view.
They said that the fact that the perpetrator showed so little concern over whether he could be recognised points away from kidnapping for ransom.
- What does that mean?
- Means he's a psychopath.
- Jesus.
- My baby.
Mrs Landry, can I help you with something?
- I'm going to look for my son.
- Where?
Out there. We're not going to find him in here.
- Please
- No.
Elise. Honey, we've got to let them do their jobs.
- No
- OK?
Baby, how can you just stand there?
We're not doing anything!
We've been sitting here all day while they're trying to do their jobs!
- We're going to find him.
- No! Their job is to find my son!
Their fucking job is to find my son!
Let me go! Baby, no!
No, Ben... No!
'My little boy's name is Benjamin Michael Landry.
'He's six years old.
'Please, if anyone knows anything, please...

'Please don't hurt him.'

Stop crying, you little baby.
This is a messy room.
I'm telling.
I'm telling Daddy.
Look, Daddy, another messy boy.
Are you angry, Daddy?
Yes. Yes, Princess.
I am very, very angry.
- What are you going to do, Daddy?
- Stay away from me.
What are you going to do,
Daddy?
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Yes?
We received a report about someone crying in the basement.
I've been depressed lately.
Haven't you ever felt like crying?
There you go.
What's your name, sir?
Kozlowski.
John Kozlowski.
- Do you live here?
- Excuse me, do you have children?
No. Why?
- Would you mind if we come inside?
- Do you have a warrant?
He's got kids clothes inside.
I'm going to say it one more time.
Can we please come inside to talk?
You can't enter my house without a warrant or my permission and you don't have my permission.
Have a nice day.
Give me your hands!
- Shut up!
- You're hurting me, stop!
- You got him?
- Hold still.
- What are you doing?
- Got him! Call for backup.
- Get off me!
- Dispatch, this is Officer Alvarez.
Please send backup to 321 Spruce Avenue.
You don't have a warrant!

'Bye-bye.'
I'm sor...
Maybe it's not him.
Mrs Landry. Mr Landry.
This way, please.
Oh, God.
No! My baby! Oh, my...
'Good boy!'
'l think they love this!'
'Bye, Mummy.'
Don't say anything.
What? What? What do you want?
- It's one o'clock.
- So what?
You can't live like this, Elise.
Leave me alone.
What's up, Doc?
You are looking good.
Why don't you stay home so we can play doctor right here?
I've got to go sell a house and you're going to sit on your butt all day.
Benji, come here, bug!
- You know Mummy's got to go to work.
- No, Mummy. I don't want you to go.
Give me a hug.
- Love you, Mummy.
- Love you too.
- Why do you have to go to work?
- One of us has to work around here.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Love you.
Bye, Mummy.
- Hey, Spartacus.
- Yeah?
What do you say we play some soccer?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Hey, buddy.
Did your mummy put sunscreen on you?
- No.

I need a phone!
Do you have a phone?
Look, I need to phone the police!
Do you have a cell phone?
Give me your fucking phone!
Please!
- Give me your fucking cell phone!
- Please don't break my window.
Just... here...
'911. What's your emergency?'
Someone's kidnapped my son.
Hi.
I love you, Elise.
I love you too.
We're going to get through this.
How could you have let this happen?
Come on!
We've already been through this.
Couldn't you have broken through the passenger side window?
- With what?
- With your fist!
By the time
I got there, it was pulling away.
What the fuck, Elise!
What are you doing?
I would have been out there a lot sooner if
I didn't have to search through all this.
OK, old vitamins and hand creams and all this holistic crap and all this other shit that you keep in here for no fucking reason at all!
I can't help it.
It's not your fault.
It could have happened to me just as easily, Craig.
I know that... on a rational level... but deep down I can't help it.
I just have the need... to blame someone.
I know it's not fair.
'Did you have a good day at school?
'Ben, did you clean your room?'
'I don't want to clean my room.
Can I go outside and play?'
'l know it's cliché but you seriously have to eat your vegetables.'
'Will you read me a story?'
'OK.'
'Look what I made you at school.
- 'Do you like it?'
- 'Oh, that's beautiful.'
'Yes, it will be there in the morning when you wake up.
'You did? Let me see it.
Not bad.'
'When's Dad coming home from the hospital?'
'Let's go get in bed, you.'
'Do I have to go to bed?
Ten more minutes, please.'
'Ben, enough of the candy, it's bedtime.
'Ben, take the lollypop out of your mouth, you already brushed your teeth.'
'l love you, Mummy.'
'l love you too, bug.'
'Deliberation began today
'in the murder trial of Benjamin Michael Landry.
'The six-year-old, who was found brutally murdered
'in the basement of defendant...
'...John Kozlowski's backyard.
'No one at the police department was willing to comment on this...
'...hidden under the cellar stairs.
'...collecting disability at the time of the murder.
'Many residents of Rutland Country were shocked...
'...Kozlowski's basement days after...'
- She said she'd be here, right?
- Yes. She said she definitely would.
All rise.
Honourable Justice Everett Stanley.
Be seated.
This court is now in session.
Docket Number 7564.
Defendant John Kozlowski.
Two counts, murder in the first degree.
Two counts, kidnapping.
Two counts, forced confinement.
Two counts, aggravated assault.
One count, resisting arrest.
How do you plead?
May it please the court, my client pleads not guilty.
Know that I will not rest until Kozlowski pays for this,
I promise you.
What is the maximum sentence
Kozlowski can get?
Life without parole.
So there's no chance he's ever getting out?
Well, practically none.
- What?
- What do you mean, "practically none"?
Well, the jury could recommend
25 years to life if they felt it was warranted but that's highly unlikely.
Warranted?
My son was six years old.
How is killing a helpless child ever warranted?
Look, do your job!
And make sure this piece of shit gets put away for life.
Once I opened the fortified door,
I discovered Benjamin's body.
He must have died just moments before.
After paramedics responded to Benjamin, the investigation quickly uncovered a mass grave located in the defendant's backyard.
Within the site, numerous body parts in various stages of decomposition were found.
Rutland County Forensics Team is still trying to determine the amount of victims and their identities through the skeletal remains exhumed from the defendant's property.
The task has been challenging since no victims were intact and the bodies were systematically mutilated.
I wish he was dead.
Did you see the look on his face?
I want him dead.
Well, it's not our decision to make.
Elise.
Are you going to be all right?
Do you want to talk to someone?
I'm losing my mind now because I want justice?
No.
I'm just worried about you.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes we have, Your Honour.
Would the defendant please rise and face the jury?
Would you please tell the court your verdict?
We the jury find the defendant...
Twenty-five years to life?
He could be out in ten years!
It was the only way they could get him to reveal the locations of the other bodies.
- Oh, God.
- Their families needed that for closure.
They put tremendous pressure on the D.A.
OK, come here.
I want you to help me get a gun.
- What?
- I want you to help me get a gun.
Jesus Christ, Elise, you...
You can't talk like that.
I mean, do you really want to lower yourself to what he is?
- Aren't we more evolved than that?
- Don't give me that crap.
It's not crap!
You don't want me to be like him, Craig?
Fuck off!
How could I ever be like him?
Look, killing him is not going to change anything.
It's not going to bring Ben back.
I want him dead.
Craig, I don't want him eating.
I don't want him exercising, watching TV or fucking jerking off.
- You're just angry.
- Craig, how do you do this?
- Do what?
- Disconnect like this from reality?
We failed our son.
We failed him.
It was our responsibility to protect him.
And we failed to do that and he's dead.
Now don't you feel we need to do something?
For the dignity of our child.
Fuck.
I left the bills on your desk.
The electric bill is overdue.
Bye, Craig.
'Blow out the candles, buddy.'
'Make a wish, Benji.'
'Flying' 'Hold on!'
'Hi, Daddy.'
'Every day we struggle, knowing what our son went through.
'Imagine being assaulted by a 13 foot giant.
'That's roughly the scale of a child to a grown man.
'A monster of a man...'
'Shut the fuck up.'
'...who subjects you to the most repulsive depravities.
'Imagine on top of that you were someone...
'...someone new to this world.
'A child.'
'Bug, we miss you. Here I am.'
'Shut up.
'What are you going to do, Daddy?'
Killing him is not punishment enough.
I don't like this, Craig.
Everyone knows you in there.
Not everybody.
Shit.
What the hell are you doing here, Craig?
The Board gave you six months, take it.
Elise is a fucking wreck.
Everyday it just gets worse.
- I needed to get out of the house.
- So why did you come here?
You throw yourself into work, hide in the back of an ambulance?
She needs you.
What happened was a tragedy for her, for both of you.
- You know you can call me, right?
- Yeah, I know.
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Don't get yourself in trouble.
What do you see?
- It's him.
- Let me see.
Bastard.
- Let me see.
- No. Let's go, let's go.
There they are.
- Yeah, I see them.
- OK.
- Craig, please keep a distance.
- I know!
Can you please...
We've got to stay calm, both of us.
Otherwise we're not going to be able to pull this thing off.
I'm sorry.
They're not going to stop.
Look.
- How do you take it, black, cream?
- One cream, one sugar.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- You have everything?
- Yeah... OK.
OK...
All right, go.
- I'll see you in there.
- OK.
There you go.
- There you go, sir.
- Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Can I help you?
Ma'am?
- Do they have any brown sugar?
- Don't see any.
Thanks.
- Hey, where's my change?
- What change?
I gave you 20 dollars on pump five, where's my change?
- I'll give you no change.
- Give me my money.
I don't owe you any money.
All right, maybe you're right, sorry.
Fucking mutt!
- Did you do it?
- Done.
It should kick in in about a half an hour.
- It's been 45 minutes.
- Yeah.
- You sure this is going to work?
- Elise, please.
Maybe they didn't drink their coffee right away.
They're speeding up.
I think it's working.
They're looking for a place to pull over.
- Here?
- I guess we have no choice.
All right, now!
Buckle your fucking seatbelt, asshole.
Shit!
Hey! Stop!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go.
For Christ's sake, slow down.
Oh, my...
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Craig!
Craig!
God!
Craig!
Are you OK?
Oh, God!
Yeah, I think so.
He's over there!
- Oh, my God. Let me see.
- I'm OK.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.
He may not have survived this.
- He's alive.
- Thank God.
Here we go.
By tomorrow, he'll be out of the woods.
That'll be good.
I'm sure you've figured out by now why you're here.
And what's going to happen to you.
If you think this is going to be over quickly, you're very much mistaken.
You know, Craig is a doctor.
I can keep you alive for weeks.
And if you think you're just going to pass out, that's not going to happen.
I have drugs to keep you conscious.
You're going to feel everything.
From now until the moment you die you will know nothing but agony.
We will just keep hurting you.
And hurting you.
Imagine the worst pain you've ever experienced.
It will be much worse than that.
By the time we're finished with you you're going to look like a cadaver from an anatomy class.
I know a million things are rushing through your head right now.
What can I do?
How can I change what's happening to me?
How can I change their minds?
Well you can't.
There's nothing you can say or do that will change any of this.
You sealed your fate.
See you in the morning.
- You coming?
- I'll be there in a minute.
Don't try to talk.
I got this.
Hello.
'Mrs Landry, this is Detective Berger.
- Mrs Landry?
- 'Yes, hi.'
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
Kozlowski has escaped.
'The prison transport that was carrying him was commandeered.'
Commandeered?
'We want you to know we've put the world on this.
'By the off chance that he tries to reach you,
'l want you to call us directly.
- 'We will find him.'
- Elise?
'I'm on my way to his house now to look for him.'
OK, thank you.
Elise... I'm sorry.
'Daddy, where's mum?
'Daddy?
Can you tuck me in, please?'
'Tuck you in?'
'l can't sleep, I'm too scared.'
'Well, what are you scared of?
I would never let anyone hurt you.'
'Daddy, I'm scared.
Can I sleep with you and Mummy?'
No more painkillers for you, asshole.
Just in case you need to use the bathroom.
You sick fuck!
I'm going to make sure you get the death penalty, asshole!
Shut up!
- Ready?
- I'm ready.
Would you...
Don't you fucking scream, you cocksucker!
Are you OK?
No, I'm...
I'm really far from OK, Craig.
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
What you wanted us to do.
I don't think I can do this.
Elise, we are doing this.
It's done, he's here.
There's no turning back, not now.
He showed no mercy for our son.
He tortured Benjamin to death.
That's not a person lying on that table.
It's a fucking monster.
You think you got a reprieve, you couldn't be more wrong.
You sick son of a bitch.
You ever had a swimmer's cramp?
It's a real bitch, isn't it?
And that's just one muscle cramping up.
Now imagine all your muscles cramping up at the same time.
It's terrifying, isn't it?
Here it comes.
Wake up! Wake up!
It's amazing what one needle can do.
You see, this needle's going to keep you conscious and aware... while this needle will inflict more pain than you've ever felt in your life.
My son begged for his life.
He screamed for you to show him mercy, but you didn't listen.
You didn't hear him.
Maybe you were fucking deaf!
This needle's going to shatter your eardrum and destroy your ear canal.
Stay fucking still!
Because if you move, it could cause you to bleed inside your skull and that blood will become trapped and it'll drain into your throat.
And since you're gagged, you'll start to fucking choke!
In about an hour or so, you'll drown in your own fucking blood.
So if I were you, I'd stay still.
Craig. Craig, Craig wake up.
It's the car alarm.
Oh, yeah?
That's interesting.
I've done quite a bit of research on torture specifically for this occasion.
I wonder if you're familiar with the game of Slonik?
It means 'little elephant' in Russian.
See?
Very popular with the Soviet Secret Police.
And also very effective.
Gel.
Stop moving or I will pour this on your face.
Good boy.
Do you know that drowning people actually scratch their faces before they take their first fatal breath of water?
Yes, their hunger for air is that great.
You see, the difference between suffocation and drowning is that when you're drowning, you have a choice to take that last breath of water and end your suffering.
But not in this case.
Soon the cells of your body will start demanding oxygen and then they'll start screaming for it.
Your need for oxygen will create an urge to breathe.
The greatest urge imaginable.
An urge you won't be able to fulfill.
You suffocated my son.
Now you're going to feel what it's like.
How does that feel?
I want to know how someone like you can justify the sick shit that you do?
How you can derive pleasure from other people's pain?
- That's enough breathing.
- Shall we do it again?
No mother should have to bury their child.
No mother should outlive her son.
This is what it feels like to not have control.
This is how our son felt, you fucking piece of shit!
You like it?
How does it feel?
- How does it fucking feel?
- Craig, stop it!
- You like it?
- Craig, stop it!
He's dead.
No.
No! No! No!
- No, Craig!
- It's not enough! We're not done!
- Craig, it's over.
- No, it's not nearly over!
- Stop it!
- He took our son!
And we just took his life!
- Did you lock the front door?
- I don't know.
- Elise, go.
- What do you want me to do?
Just go! Deal with it!
But whatever's up there cannot come down here!
Come on.
Craig!
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Motherfucker, come on.
- Squatters, huh?
- What?
This cottage belongs to old Frank Jessop and you're squatting on his property.
Come on.
Please call your dog off.
I'll call my dog, when I damn well please.
I... I'm a real estate agent.
I'm showing this property to a client of mine.
That's bullshit, lady.
Mr Jessop died over a year ago.
This property's been on the market ever since.
So what are all those noises downstairs?
We're checking the foundation of the building.
Got any Id on you?
Yes, I do.
What's your name?
You're trespassing on state property, waving a gun around, making threats.
- Where's this client of yours?
- Right here.
Well, Elise.
This place sure is charming but I am concerned about the basement.
Is everything OK up here?
I don't know, is everything OK up here?
I'm checking that story of yours.
Come on, boy.
Jesus Christ.
He's alive.
Come on.
- Detective Berger.
- U.S. Marshall Lynn Conover here.
I've got some good news for you.
We've got a break in your case.
'A woman here says she saw a prison van three days ago' just off of old Howell Ranch Road.
Stay there, I'm on my way.
Wake up! Wake up!
No. Wait, wait.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Put the tape on.
No. Wait, wait.
I don't remember anything.
I don't know who you are.
I don't even know who I am.
You don't remember who you are?
I remember some kind of a car accident.
I don't believe him.
I don't believe you.
This is too convenient!
Craig! Where are you going?
- I can't remember a thing.
- I don't believe you.
Could it be true?
- Yes.
- Yes?
Yes. I mean, he did suffer a serious head injury, memory loss could be possible.
Fuck. Fuck!
- God, what do we do?
- I don't know.
What if he's lying?
That's also a possibility considering his circumstances.
But there's no way to know for sure.
So, that's it then?
We just leave him here?
All this for nothing?
Craig, he cannot get off that easy.
That animal needs to pay for what he's done.
God, listen to yourself.
You want to torture a man who has no idea why we're doing it to him?
It's the same guy.
It's the same guy!
Shit.
- Detective Berger?
- Yeah.
- U.S. Marshal Conover.
- Nice to meet you. What do we know?
We've got a lot.
We've got a second lead.
We've got a local here who says our convicts are held up in some cabin.
Do we know where?
He's on his way now to give us a pinpoint but it's in this area.
The problem is this area is 10,000 square miles of forest.
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up! Come on, get up.
What's she doing?
You say you don't remember anything.
I know you're lying.
What was my son's name?
I didn't...
I don't know, lady.
Come on.
Come on, that's nothing.
That didn't hurt.
This is nothing.
What was my son's name?
No, stop, please!
Just say his name.
Just say his name.
I'm not going to stop.
Somebody help me, please!
You broke 18 bones in his body.
This is nothing.
Say his name!
Say his fucking name!
Benjamin! His name is Benjamin!
I'm sorry. Please stop! Please!
Still believe he doesn't remember?
You think that hurt?
It's going to get a lot worse tomorrow.
No... No!
So what do you have to tell us?
- I told you... I'm sorry.
- Sorry?
"I'm sorry" is not going cut it.
But these will.
No, no, no...
No!
You crushed my boy's liver.
No!
Oh, fuck!
Fuck this fucking shit!
I can't take this any more.
Get me out of there!
Now what?
So we just pick up tomorrow where we left off?
Have breakfast, get our tools ready.
We could just walk away, call the cops, he'd go to jail and we could just disappear.
I just want Ben back.
- I want him back so bad.
- Yeah, I know.
So do I.
He's held up in a cabin, up the road.
- Can't miss it.
- Appreciate it.
All right everybody, listen up!
This is it.
Spread out, stay alert.
Come on, boy.
Spread out!
Come on, boy! Find him, boy!
Craig! Craig!
Come on. Let's get him back on the table before he wakes up.
Craig!
- Where is he?
- Oh, God.
He just...
He walked out the front door.
- You OK?
- He just stared at me.
- We can't let him get away.
- Be careful.
This way.
Come on, boy.
There he is!
Freeze!
Cuff him!
'As you can see behind me, authorities have now located
'the abandoned Vermont
Correctional vehicle
'that was carrying John Kozlowski, the convicted child killer
'who is serving 25 years in jail.'
'Twenty-five years to life?

Why didn't you warn me?
All my friends are dead.
My family was wiped out by this crazy town.
- Did you read Verna's letter?
- No.
Well, I asked you to, right?
Verna was very particular.
I'm sure she laid it all out.
But you knew about him.
You knew about this town.
You knew everything.
Oh, okay.
Okay, so who is he?
Well, the person in the basement is Jedidiah Sawyer.
Goes by Jed.
He's your cousin.
For years I suspected something, but I never knew for sure about Jed until about four months ago when Verna, who was very sick, presented him to me.
A grown man, huge, but mentally stunted.
With emotions of an eight-year-old.
Frankly, he scared the shit out of me.
Why'd she keep him?
Nobody loves you like your family, I guess.
She preserved you, too.
She investigated everyone who was involved with the...
August 19th.
Found you right away.
And she let me live with those people?
You were safer there.
And she knew there would always come a day.
Jed knows about you, too.
That was some welcome.

And the last time a girl got away,
Jed lost his whole family.

Good evening.
I'm Stella Oleson.
I'm a survivor of Barrow.
I've been traveling for the past 10 months, trying to find ways to make people understand.
So I wanna thank you... all of you, for being here tonight, for having an open mind.
The story I'm about to tell you is an absolute truth.
It wasn't a faulty pipeline... that destroyed our peaceful town.
Ninety-eight people didn't die in an oil fire.
No.
The truth is... last year when the sun set for 30 days, our town, Barrow, Alaska, came under siege by a clan of vampires.
That's ok.
People always laugh.
But tonight... tonight will be different.
See, they go to great lengths to make you think that they don't exist... which is why, every time I do one of these things a couple of them show up.
Well, I have a surprise for you.
I've rigged the ceiling with three
SunMax ultraviolet lights, each of which are the same intensity and wavelength as the sun at high noon.
If there are any of you out there
I suggest you stand and show yourselves.
Otherwise...
I'm a vampire.
Hit the lights.
Clever little show.
Well, people need to know the truth.
That's a good one.
My husband, my closest friends,
I watched them die.
I understand.
And post-traumatic stress can...
It can really mess a person up.
All those people tonight, they can't deny what they saw.
But what they saw was a hoax, right?
An elaborate stunt perpetrated by a very sick woman.
If it was a hoax, then why send in the FBI?
You're a thorn in my side,
Stella Oleson.
If it were up to me,
I'd choke you with my bare hands and bury you in the fucking desert.
Others, however, feel... that would draw too much attention.
Who are you?
The body's already in the incinerator.
No one will ever believe you.
Sorry Eben.
Come on, give me the key.
No.
No.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Paul.
That's Todd.
And that's Amber.
Great. Now why the fuck are you in my room?
Dane sent us.
I lost my daughter, three years ago, up in Washington.
My mom and dad, right off our farm outside of Tulsa.
My fiance, New Orleans, middle of the fucking city.
And no one believed us.
Might as well have been talking about UFOs, Bigfoot, some shit.
Which is why, for the last two years, we've been out there hunting them.
Hunting them?
Yes.
And we could use a fourth.
No, you don't hunt them.
They hunt you.
See?
What did I tell you?
Where you going?
This is a fucking waste of time.
Amber.
Hey.
Look, Stella, we know what it's like... waking up in the night... with your heart pounding.
We're offering you a chance to end that... put those nightmares to rest.
You don't know me.
No. No, we don't know you.
But we know you're a survivor.
What was it, 30 days?
And you held on?
You know their strengths, their weaknesses.
No one's gonna believe you.
You're gonna have to face that.
They found us.
Found her.
How many?
Just one, so far.
All right.
Get the door.
Yep.
Son of a...
Fuck.
Yeah, take a seat.
Time to check out?
The FBI agent... he wasn't one of them, but...
Yeah, man, they call them bug eaters.
Wannabes.
Fuckers are everywhere.
They do Lilith's bidding, and in return she promises them immortality.
Lilith, who's Lilith?
She's the one we're after.
Queen bee.
You really haven't done your homework, have you?
I'm sorry. Do you have a problem with me or are you just....
Yeah, actually I do. I'm afraid you're gonna get us all killed.
Easy, A.
This is what Dane wanted.
She's like a fucking magnet.
Lilith orchestrates everything.
She keeps them organized.
She keeps them secret.
She also keeps way off the grid.
But Dane's helped us track her here to Los Angeles.
Yo, if we could take her out... the entire network falls apart.
Let's check it out.
Come on.
Let me get my shoe on. Shit.
Jesus Christ.
What the shit is that?
Come on, look at his hands.
Well, well, enjoying the view?
Where are we?
You're gonna meet your friend, Dane.
Trouble?
Little bit.
Were you followed?
I don't think so.
No, no way they followed us.
We were traveling, like,
80 miles an hour.
No. Don't. Stella... he's not like the others.
Stella.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
I imagine this must be very unsettling.
My wound... was superficial... and so somehow
I've managed to hold on... all these years... to some... semblance of my humanity.
That's not possible.
No?
How do you feed?
Does that all the time.
Fucking disgusting.
Why did you start writing me letters?
Why did you start reading them?
You knew things... things other people couldn't possibly know.
And I wanted answers.
You wanted revenge.
And the only way to get that... is with force.
They're old service tunnels.
An earthquake in the '70s rendered them useless, but Lilith has carved them out as a nest.
This the only entrance?
The rest are sealed off.
How many uglies are we talking here?
It's hard to say.
I'm sure we can handle it.
Wait, you're planning on just walking in there and killing her?
Yes.
We got big guns, sweetheart.
We've gone into nests like this before,
Seattle, New Orleans.
Yeah, this ain't our first picnic.
This one might be different though.
Lilith is in L.A. for a reason.
Whatever it is,
I'm certain she's brought backup.
Well, it could be our only shot.
Yeah.
What if she disappears?
Who knows how long it'll be before we find her again.
Use the daylight as usual.
Give yourselves an out.
If it's daylight, what about you?
I don't go.
Right.
It's the best time to do it.
Yeah.
If the four of us can corner her... if three of you can corner her.
I never agreed to any of this.
Told you.
Lil... Lilith, I...
I...
I've detained the witnesses from the motel.
I was thinking maybe... it was time.
She wants to know about the Alaskan,
Stella.
She's...
I sent her packing, back to Barrow.
She wants to know how you can be so sure.
How can I be so...
Because I threatened her.
I scared her.
She was afraid of me.
Well, what did she just?
Mind if I sit?
May I?
Go ahead.
So, what's your plan now?
Going back to Barrow?
I can't.
Can't risk them following me back there.
Yeah.
Home is... an unfamiliar concept.
I haven't been home in years.
Your daughter.
What was her name?
Addie.
Adeline.
That's beautiful.
She'd have been 6 next week.
I heard the window... shatter upstairs.
I rushed back to her room.
I saw him.
I saw him there in the window with her.
He looked back at me.
Those black eyes... hollow.
And then she was gone.
Nobody believed me.
Not the police.
Not my wife.
Ex-wife now.
So I kept moving... but always... listening... for a story like mine.
That's how I found Todd and Amber.
That's how we found you.
Lilith.
You said she orchestrates.
They don't make a move without her saying so.
Not one move.
Barrow?
Hey, you ok?
Yeah.
Shit, man.
I thought we had it bad back in Bywater.
A lot of desperate people.
It's all right, though.
You know, it was home.
Live just about anywhere when you're with somebody you care about.
How about you, Stella?
What's it like up there in Barrow?
Cold.
It's a Marine Defender.
There are six in the mag.
You can go ahead and check.
Here.
Bullets only slow them down.
I know.
I guess you do.
Shit.
All right?
Yeah, I just...
Fucker.
I'm good.
Fucker.
Sorry.
Shit.
Watch your step.
You guys, we never go this far from the light.
I'm serious.
This isn't how we did it last time.
Amber.
You smell that?
Yeah.
Shit.
That's real fresh.
Let's be careful.
They could be close.
This isn't right.
This is a mistake.
This is not how we do things and you know it.
We're too far from the sun.
This is not the time Amber.
We're too fucking so far.
Shut up Amber.
We need to back up and to regroup.
We do it now or we don't do it.
No, this isn't how we do things.
You're gonna get us killed.
You know fuck this.
I'm going back.
Amber.
Die!
Behind you, Stella!
Fuck.
Amber!
Go!
Hold on.
Amber!
This way!
Come on, over here.
Go, go, go.
Todd, you ok?
Where did they get you Todd?
What happened?
What have they done?
All right?
Crap!
It's ok.
Kill me.
No.
No
Todd... you can hold on.
You can hold on, ok?
Hey, Dane held on for all this years, you can too.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
You can.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hold on.
Will you?
Todd?
I can feel myself... slipping away.
No.
Paul.
No!
You know how this works.
Jesus Christ!
I can't.
I can't.
You don't have a choice.
Todd.
Do something!
Todd,
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not doing it.
Look at me.
I'm your friend, Todd.
I know you.
Fight it, Todd.
Fight it.
Fight it.
I thought you said you've done this before.
Never one of our own.
Yeah, well, get used to that.
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna get out of here?
Fight our way out.
How are we gonna do that?
We're low on ammo.
We're down a man.
Well, what do you suggest?
We wait.
Until dark, until they go out and hunt.
No, fuck that.
Fuck that. I can't..
Stay in here.
I can't.
Can you try not to lose your shit and get another one of us killed?
What?
What the fuck?
Amber.
What the fuck did you just say?
You think this is my fault?
You think this was my fault!
That what you think?
Well, fuck you. Everything was fine until you showed up.
You'd be doing me a favor.
Fuck.
We'll wait till dark.
Are they still out there?
I don't see them.
Wait, Paul.
What the fuck are you do...
Come on. They've gone to feed.
Nice of you to join us.
I found a way out.
What the fuck are you doing?
Just kill it.
Where's Lilith?
I don't think he heard you.
Did you not hear me?
Where is Lilith?
I told you.
He'll die before he gives her up.
No, please!
No!
Let me go!
Please.
We didn't see nothing.
Open your mouth.
Fuck you.
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
Please!
No!
Please!
What the fuck you sick bitch?
You want to get out... tell me something.
There'll be another feast soon.
Where the sun doesn't rise.
How's that for useful?
Tell me what town.
Only the queen knows.
They're planning another siege, during the darkness.
Sun sets in three days.
Don't.
Let him go.
You can use him.
Slow. Slow down or they'll hear us.
There. There he is.
How many you think are in there?
I don't know.
Could be lots.
Hey, what do you keep in that bag of yours?
Just 12 pounds of C-4.
Good, then we'll wait till the sun's up.
What?
So, what do you do when all this is done?
I used to feel like finding Lilith was my endgame.
Like it was the last of my business.
Once we got it done, if I survived...
I was gonna finally go home... put on my robe... sit on my porch... brew myself up a nice cup of coffee... drink it while the sun come up... then blow my fucking brains out.
But I don't think like that anymore.
What do you think like now?
Like I wanna put this all behind me.
Start over.
They won't come out if we're near the light.
Then we'll go where it's darker.
Yeah, well, it won't be dark for long.
Guys.
Shit.
Are they dead?
It's ok.
Help me, please.
Get me out of here.
Calm down.
We're gonna help you.
Hold still.
It's ok. I know.
Please.
You gotta be quiet now.
What's your name?
Tell me your name, sweetheart.
Jennifer.
Oh, my God.
Jennifer.
We're gonna get you out.
It's ok.
Can you tell me where they are?
They're everywhere.
Where's the detonator?
I don't know.
It's gone.
We're fucked!
Stay behind me.
There's too many.
Stella!
Fuck.
Fucking thumb.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Be careful.
Here, watch your step.
Was she here?
I don't know.
Let's go.
You're ok.
I got you.
You're ok.
It's gonna be all right.
You're safe now.
Ok, ready?
On three.
One.
Fuck!
Shit.
Easy, easy, easy.
Joint's gonna be pretty weak.
Could slip out.
Thanks.
Ok.
I can do it.
It's ok. I got it.
Where's the girl?
Jennifer?
She's sleeping.
We need to find out what she knows.
Yeah, well, she can barely put two sentences together so... let's give her a minute.
All right.
All set.
I haven't felt anything in a long time... except anger.
And that's gotten me this far.
It's Dane.
He's helping them.
I've been trailing them.
I know where they're hiding.
Take care of it.
I'm running out of time.
I want this.
Please.
Show me.
God. Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!
God.
You fucking...
They brought us on a ship... with bodies.
So many.
Some of us they took ashore... to keep bleeding us.
And Lilith, was she on the ship?
I... think.
I don't know. They...
Come on, Jennifer.
I need you to remember.
Does sh...
Maybe don't push too hard?
Can you try to remember?
Does Lilith stay on the ship?
I think so.
Do you remember where it was?
I saw army boats.
Would you recognize it, the ship?
Dane!
Dane!
Take her out back.
Ok. Come on.
Come on.
Out the back.
Come on.
Come on.
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go!
What the fuck was that?
Is he following us?
I don't think so.
Do you see it?
There.
Over there.
When we get out of here...
I want you to take this car and go.
Ok?
Stella... we don't even have a plan for this.
We could call the Coast Guard.
And tell them what?
There's a ship full of vampires?
We're gonna get on that thing, and stop it from leaving.
And you know it's suicide, right?
Let's go.
What the hell are they doing?
Is that...
Is that blood?
They can come back.
If they still have their head.
What was that?
It's moving.
It's happening.
They're leaving.
Wait, wait, wait. We...
We cannot be stuck on this ship.
We will not make it.
We don't have a choice.
Yes, we fucking do have a choice.
We could...
We could run back now and we could swim for it.
Then what?
This ship gets to the Arctic Circle, hundreds more will die.
Paul?
I'm sorry.
Fuck it.
Here.
Navigation room.
Is that up?
It's one level up, three sectors over.
Through the mess hall.
Ok.
Oh, God.
Kill me.
Amber.
Hey.
Turn.
Who the fuck are you?
I...
Where's the ship headed?
Alaska.
Town called Wainwright.
Turn it around.
I can't.
I can't. I'm sorry.
Don't say sorry.
Just turn it the fuck around.
I'd do like she says, pal.
Please.
They have my family.
They said...
Said they'd do terrible things.
They don't tell me anything.
No!
Amber!
Do it.
Paul.
How many bullets you got?
Not enough.
Use them on ourselves?
I was thinking the same thing.
Bleed them out.
You get to watch first.
No. Don't do this.
No!
Fuck!
Ok. Hold still.
Let me see.
Oh, God. Ok.
It's gonna be ok.
I need to stop the ship.
Do you have any idea how this shit works?
No.
I think that did something.
Paul.
No!
Stella.
Does it feel like it did in Barrow?
When you held your dear Eben?
Felt him die... in your arms?
Stella.
I can smell you.
I can smell your blood.
<font color="#ff8000">I felt nothing.</font>

Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead...
That exit sends them right at us.
We force them west here...
Away from the community.
They'll follow a path if something's drawing them.
Carter!
Sh sh sh.
You gotta be quiet.
Why don't you head back?
Tell everyone what's happening.
They got inside the walls.
They're killing people.
Leave!
My people have guns...
...yours don't.
Try again.
Tobin, it's not stopping.
Light it up. You hear me?
Tobin!
- Michonne.
- Got it.
Shit! Shit!
It was half.
Jesus, it was more than half.
We just gotta stay ahead of them.
They walk, we run.
- Rick!
- I'm here.
What's going on back there?
Half of them broke off.
They're going toward Alexandria.
Towards you?
We ran ahead.
There's a horn or something.
Loud, coming from the east.
It's not stopping.
I'm gonna gas it up, turn back.
We have it.
You keep going.
They're gonna need our help.
Gotta keep the herd moving.
Not if it's going down, we don't.
The rest of that herd turns around, the bad back there gets worse.
Daryl?
Yeah, I heard you.
Nicholas.
- Ah!
- You okay?
It's my ankle.
All right, come on.
Grab on. Let's go.
Come on.
It's coming from back home.
- It has to be.
- He did this.
He brought us all out here to die.
- He killed Carter.
- Carter was dead already.
Now they're in trouble back there and we're done.
- We're good as dead.
- Hey, calm down.
What the hell are you talking about?
We are done.
And it's 'cause of him.
Shut up and move.
Come on.
Damn it.
All right, listen up.
Here's the new plan.
I go back, get the RV, circle around the woods on Redding.
I'll get in front of them before they get there.
I can lead them away again.
RV's a mile back.
I can go with you.
I'll handle it.
Just get home.
They might need you there.
Glenn, Michonne.
If something's in front of you, you kill it.
No hiding, no waiting.
You keep going.
I'm going with you. You can't do this on your own.
- Glenn, I can do this.
- You need to help me.
- We've got to get these people back.
- Yeah.
Thing is, they aren't all gonna make it.
- Rick.
- You try to save them, you try, but they can't keep up, you keep going.
You have to. You make sure you get back.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
The horn stopped. Good.
Get back safe.
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>
We're ahead of it.
10 minutes.
20 minutes, maybe.
We all keep up the pace, we all get back home.
So if we don't, that's it, huh?
We don't even know what's waiting for us.
It's gonna be okay.
We have walls for a reason.
That sound. Maybe someone plowed right through.
Maybe we're walking back to nothing.
Shh, my wife's back there.
Mine, too.
Look, don't worry about what's gone wrong.
Figure out how to make this go right.
We're moving in the same direction everything else is.
We're gonna catch up with something.
We're gonna catch up with a lot of things and we're gonna end them.
We have no choice.
We gotta keep going forward.
Stay here.
Don't shoot unless you have to.
Come on.
That's us.
Sturgess!
I know what it means.
We gotta keep moving, right?
Hey, we gone five miles out yet?
Give or take some yardage.
You got a reason for asking?
Next intersection we're gonna spin around and go back.
The plan is to go 15 more.
Yeah, I'm gonna change that.
Five's gonna have to work.
The magic number's 20.
That's the mission.
That's making sure they're off munching on infirm raccoons the rest of their undead lives instead of any of us.
You want to go, we can't stop you.
But without you, they could stop us.
- Can I take a look?
- Please?
Nah, I got faith in you.
- Daryl!
- Don't do it, man!
Is it bad?
It's about what you'd expect.
Huh, didn't expect this.
How long you been married?
Three months.
She wasn't my wife from before.
How'd you meet?
It was early on.
Aaron found me.
I was alone, lost everything.
Everyone.
Myself, I--
I wasn't crazy.
I just gave up on being someone, an actual person.
Know what I mean?
I do.
We found Betsy on the way back to the community.
She still saw me.
After I thought
I was dead and gone, she was my first friend.
Then she was more.
She made me more.
Even better than
how I used to be.
But if I could make it back,
I'd want to say good-bye.
Tell her... finding her in all this, that was everything.
We need to stop and bandage him up.
No, we keep moving.
I'm okay.
You won't be if we don't stop your bleeding.
We'll find a place.
Can't stop out in the open too long.
Come on.
Let's check if these cars work first.
See if they can get us back.
I'll stay with them.
Listen, I need to get home, but I'm not leaving them behind.
We patch Scott up, we get going.
Rick knows what he knows.
We're ahead of the herd.
Maybe half an hour now.
We can stop.
We can make it.
This is halfway home, right?
Yeah.
This is where it happened.
I said it at the dealership.
Me and Aiden didn't know what we were doing.
The people on your crew who died?
They weren't afraid.
We were.
No luck.
We have to stay on foot.
Nicholas was here last.
He can show us the way.
Uh, okay.
All right.
There's no cars.
I got you.
I got you.
Oh, Jesus.
Sturgess?
He left us behind.
Herd's that way.
Shit.
- Nicholas.
- Uh...
We stay quiet, patch Scott and Annie up, get out of here.
Those walkers in the alley and down the street, they're blocking the way out of town.
We can't take 'em on, not in the shape that we're in.
We'll have to lead them away if we have to.
Because that's been working well lately.
I'm trying here.
I'm not giving up.
Yeah, not yet.
Hey, I was thinking, if we can find a way to distract the herd coming in, then they won't make it back to the community.
How?
Burn one of the buildings.
Hopefully more.
They'll get drawn to it and they'll stop here.
It's gonna take some time.
I'll do it.
You stay with them.
It's my plan.
It's on me.
You have a wife, Glenn.
That's why I'm doing this.
You've got to get everybody back.
You're the one who can.
If I take too long, you just go.
I'm not leaving without you.
- That is not the way this works.
- I will meet you there.
If I get stuck out here, I'll find some way to show you guys I'm okay.
We all have a job to do.
There's a feed store.
It's old.
A lot of dry stuff inside.
It should go up easy.
I'll go with you.
I can--
I can draw a map.
No.
You lead the way.
Just gotta do one thing first.
Rick, it's Glenn.
We're in a town five degrees east of the green marker.
If you get around on Redding in the next 20 minutes, you should be good.
I think that's how far
we're ahead of the herd.
I'm gonna try to set a fire
and distract them.
If you don't see smoke, they're still coming your way.
I got to go.
Good luck, dumbass.
That'll keep you going until we get you back to the infirmary.
Annie, I'm gonna figure out a crutch for you.
Just leave me.
What?
I'm slowing you down.
We're gonna hit more roamers.
It's that simple.
Leave me.
Leave us.
No.
It's stupid for you guys to wait on me.
We'll all go down.
Come on, man, wake up.
You don't want to do it now, you do it out there.
We get into trouble again, you run.
- And you don't look back.
- No, if we go, we go together.
We got each other's backs just like always.
Okay, we don't leave people behind.
Not us.
No one is leaving anyone behind.
I'm gonna find something for you, Annie.
Hey.
Do you have a problem with me?
I'm just looking out for my people.
And you think that I'm not?
Look, I heard what Rick said.
Which part?
How they wouldn't all make it.
They meaning us and not you.
How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.
Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.
Yeah, we will.
Rick said what he said because sometimes you don't have a choice.
That is not how we do it.
Because you've never had to do it any other way.
You haven't been through it, not really.
- Michonne--
- Not like Rick.
Rick was out there.
I was out there.
We know, you don't.
But if you don't learn, you will die, we will.
I've been doing runs from the start, okay?
- I know what it's like.
- Have you ever had to kill people because they had already killed your friends and were coming for you next?
Have you ever done things that made you feel afraid of yourself afterward?
Have you ever been covered in so much blood that you didn't know if it was yours or walkers' or your friends'?
Huh?
Then you don't know.
Wait.
It should be me.
He was on my crew.
His name was Will.
He was 19.
We left him behind.
You're not that guy anymore.
Hey, you are here now.
You are not that guy anymore.
Okay.
Shit.
Is that home?
We need to go now.
Okay. Okay, let's go.
Come on.
We gotta go now.
The ones from down the street and in the alley, they're getting drawn by the gunfire.
Soon as they clear, we head for the feed store.
Till then we sit tight,
keep quiet.
They heard that.
They know we're in here now.
We can't wait them out.
The herd, it's gonna be here any minute.
What?
They're coming.
Go!
Come on!
Where's the feed store?
- Go! The other end of town. We can try--
- We can't.
Glenn said we got to go.
We go now.
Ah!
Just run!
Go!
It's just up ahead.
We light it up and we go.
There's gotta be another building.
- We gotta go.
- Um...
- Where?!
- Uh, uh...
- Nicholas!
- This way.
- This-- this way.
- Go! Go!
You go over first, and then we'll help Scott.
No, they're coming.
Just go.
We're doing this.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
No!
Damn it.
We gotta go.
We gotta keep going.
We don't have a choice.
We don't have a choice.
Come on!
Up here!
Up here!
Nicholas!
Hey, Nicholas!
Nicholas!
Look at me.
Hey, look at me!
Look at me!
Hey! Hey!
Nicholas!
Look at me!
Thank you.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
There's no smoke.
It doesn't mean they didn't make it.
The herd's still coming, but this creek should slow them down some.
Glenn.
I'm in place by my best guess.
You guys make it back yet?
Glenn.
Tobin, you there?
Daryl?
I'm here.
Won't be long now.
They're almost here.
I'll get them going
your way again.
How 'bout that, Daryl?
He's gonna be coming our way.
There's gunfire coming from back home.
We gotta sit with it and hope they can handle it.
I think they can.
They have to.
We keep going forward for them.
Can't turn back
'cause we're afraid.
We ain't afraid.
This is for them.
Going back now before it's done, that'd be for us.
The herd has to be almost here.
Rick?
Rick?
Rick?
Rick?
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Oh, I didn't see that one coming.
This is the last time we're ever going to be doing this.
It's completely unexpected.
-I-- I mean, I audibly gasped.
-(GASPS)
Like, "No!"
♪ (EPIC MUSIC PLAYING) ♪
DAVE HILL:
 First episodes of every season
 are always a challenge.
But for the final season, it was a lot of pressure
 because we had
all these characters convening at Winterfell.
D.B. WEISS: We thought that the arrival was a way to capture what was at stake for Dany and for Jon.
 For Arya on the ground,
 and for Tyrion and Varys,
 and Grey Worm
 and Missandei on horseback.
Everybody has a slightly different take on what's happening here.
Background! Action!
David Nutter directed half the season for us, and there's no more beloved director in the business.
BERNADETTE CAULFIELD:
 Usually a director
on  Game of Thrones will shoot for three days, then he has two days prep, and then he maybe shoots for a full week,
 but Nutter just had to go
 all out
 for eight or nine weeks
 of shooting.
KIT HARINGTON:
I was so happy that he was back
 for the final season.
David Nutter really felt like part of the family.
DAVID NUTTER: We shot, uh,
 a lot of the parade stuff
 at the end of the year
 where we had kind of
 the two shortest days
 of the year.
Then we came back and kinda brought some scope to it.
Winter's Town is a settlement just outside of Winterfell.
 And so that road was snowed.
 We built the little buildings
 that led up the road.
 It was completely redressed
 to be the Winterfell
 little town.
It's basically a huge parade.
 The ADs sought out background villagers' reactions,
 so you're actually working
with the extras in a way so you're getting a performance out of everybody.
 We worked with
 the military advisers
 so a lot of these guys looked
 professional marching step.
JAMIE MILES: When we tell them
 to do something, they do it.
 We teach them some very basic
drill movements so they know how to stand, everything's under a command,
 a whistle blast,
so they get to learn to react in a military style, in a disciplined style.
CHRIS NEWMAN: Anything that's
on the page, we tend to... show rather than just imply.
 If you're gonna say you want
to see thousands of Unsullied, then we have to show it.
STEFEN FANGMEIER:
 It's a significant
 big scope moment.
 So the challenge
was definitely to find ways to really make it seem like thousands are arriving.
You have to have a vantage point
 from higher up.
NUTTER: When I read
the opening sequence and I saw this little boy running to try to see the parade and see the show and see what he's missing,
 I felt like that little boy,
 'cause I'd been gone
 for two seasons.
 So, in some respects,
 I kinda was that little boy.
SOPHIE TURNER: Daenerys arrives
 and immediately,
 Sansa wants to make it
very clear that she runs this shit.
♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS) ♪
This is a tough crowd.
KIT: I think Jon knows Sansa
well enough now that, when it comes to Dany,
 he knows he's going to have
 some difficulty.
SOPHIE: Jon is in love with her,
has bent the knee, he's got googly eyes on, he's got like, beer goggles on.
NUTTER: I basically sat down
with Sophie and told her, you have to remember one thing:
This is your house.
JON SNOW: Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark.
The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed.
As are you.
You're meeting the family!
You want to do well!
You want them to like you, goddamn it!
 And, um, you're met with this stony, stoic silence.
KIT: It's not a comfortable
 homecoming, no.
There are a lot of people on set kind of like a giant game
 of "Where's Waldo?"
In the first episode, a couple of our friends from the comedy world were in a scene.
They gouged my eye out!
-(LAUGHS)
-They gouged my fucking eye out!
They can put it back in, right?
-Right?
-Yeah.
Benioff told me they would.
DAVID BENIOFF:
 When we found out
 that George Lucas
 wanted to visit,
 we thought maybe
it was a practical joke, and then we were really excited and also nervous
 because it's George Lucas.
DAENERYS:
Your sister doesn't like me.
JON:
If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.
Now print.
NUTTER: George would be sitting
 at my director's chair,
 that was so cool for me.
I had George go out and speak to Kit and Emilia.
Okay, okay, that was great.
Great. Great.
No direction for you...
-I don't really care about you.
-(LAUGHS)
I don't care what happens to you.
-What?!
-What's going on?
I mean, like the first time like I could remember telling stories was me as a little kid mashing together these, like Stormtrooper dolls.
 For so many of us,
he's the one who started our obsession with this kind of big, epic storytelling.
NUTTER: And of course,
the input that he put through with the writer Dave Hill's head.
MAN: Three, two, one, go!
HILL: I very much learned
the lesson that sometimes when you write two words,
 that you then create
 so much work
(CHUCKLES)
 for everyone involved.
Oh, I get an axe in the head.
Simple enough.
Next thing I know,
I'm flying to London, to go out to have my face sculpted,
 be wrapped in plaster
 and molded.
The day of, I'm in a chair for four-and-a-half hours.
It was great to see that we were basically gonna get to take Dave Hill out, one of our writers.
It's quite nice to be able to, um, kill fellow crew members off
(LAUGHS) in the nicest kind of way.
HILL: Having to go and be the one who give the performance is so much more trouble
(CHUCKLES) than I imagined.
 And I was just trying desperately not to screw it up.
 And I did, the first time.
And the second time, better at it.
DIRECTOR: And board.
♪ (DISTORTED MUSIC PLAYS) ♪
DEBORAH RILEY:
 The Godswood Tree is such
 an iconic piece of the show.
To create that Godswood tree is a huge amount of effort.
Every year, it would have to be
 painted white.
 It would be coated in latex,
 a sculpted face would be
 applied to it.
 The greens team would go about
 adding branches to it
 with flocked red leaves
 that Kevin Fraser
 would paint up for us.
It's a process where you take a flock, which is a fiber, and actually adhere it to the leaf on one surface.
 So, obviously, you've got some
 quite interesting dynamics
 when things were lit and shot.
ARYA STARK:
You used to be taller.
MAISIE WILLIAMS:
When I first got the scripts, it was like a bunch of lords and ladies talking, and I was thinking,
"Are we ever gonna get a scene together again?
And then, finally got to that scene
 and I was just beaming.
KIT:  The really spooky thing
 was turning around
 and seeing her
 for the first time,
and what I wanted to try and get was this kind of punch to the gut... of literally turning around and seeing time having past.
JON: You still have the sword.
-ARYA: Needle.
-JON: Needle.
The most amazing thing happened.
 I just didn't have to do
 anything.
 We had two actors
 who hadn't worked together
 since season one... to get a chance to show pure true love.
NUTTER:  The one thing I told
the actors in season eight, the audience just wants to see you breathe.
MAISIE:
To watch Kit grow as an actor on the show has been incredible, and I think the fans are gonna love it 'cause I loved it.
I hit you right in the face.
-KIT: It's all right.
-MAISIE: I'm so sorry!
WOMAN: Cut, go again.
Part of the fun of the episode was bringing back together all these characters. It's also the challenge of the episode because you don't want it to feel like it's, you know, just the reunion episode.
DIRECTOR: Ready and action!
♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS) ♪
ARYA: Leave him be.
WEISS: The Hound and Gendry,
we thought it would make sense for kind of the one-two punch of these two people who served very, very different roles in her life.
GENDRY:
Is that a command, Lady Stark?
Don't call me that.
He still thinks that she's the same girl
 that he left beforehand.
You've gotten better.
Yeah, thanks. So have you.
I think for Arya, it's remembering who she was before.
-I mean, you look good.
-Thanks.
Like I used to be that girl,
 and that's who I was
in love with and thought I would follow to the end of the world.
WEISS: The Hound-Arya reunion, that's a thing we were most excited about writing.
You left me to die.
I still robbed you.
Everyone would hope the reunion between Arya and The Hound would be laughs and giggles, but actually, it starts off as like cold 'cause it's kind of a defense mechanism for both characters.
THE HOUND: You're a cold little bitch, aren't you?
Guess that's why you're still alive.
There's also Tyrion and Sansa.
PETER DINKLAGE:
 There's something
between Tyrion and Sansa you can't quite put your finger on 'cause they're...
"You left me, and then you know what happened to me, and I know what happened to you."
Apologies for leaving like that.
Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.
It's tricky with them.
They have to watch their words around each other,
 but at the end of the day,
 she does trust him.
And at the very end, we have the silent reunion
 with Jamie and Bran.
If he tells the rest of the clan the truth...
I'm-- I'm done. I'm dead.
NUTTER: To me,
 I wanted to make sure that,
 with respect to people
 getting back together again,
 those all had their credence
 and importance,
 but also, I didn't want the audience to forget the fact that the impending doom was coming.
MAN: A Camera mark.
♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS) ♪
They're coming.
There's no way around it.
This is a great horror movie sequence that Dave Nutter, um, directed the hell out of.
Somehow, Beric and Tormund survived
 falling down that wall of ice.
We find that it's strangely-- there's blood everywhere, but there's no bodies.
Stay back, he's got blue eyes!
I've always had blue eyes!
Did you find anyone?
BARRIE GOWER:
The scene in The Last Hearth, we have this mandala of limbs and body parts
the Night King has left behind, which form this kind of pattern, and in the middle of it, we have Ned Umber, who's basically pinned to the wall on a huge stake.
Obviously, we know what happens to people who are killed by the Night King or white walkers.
GOWER: The young boy
was suspended in a harness, and then to basically kill the wight,
Beric uses his flaming sword and takes out the wight.
We had to shoot that on a stunt guy called Paul Lowe,
 who was of a similar sort
 of stature
 to the actor playing Ned.
PAUL LOWE: Game of Thrones is the first time I got a full burn so that's a nice tick.
 What I guess a lot
 of stuntmen wanna have.
And for that, because he was gonna be engulfed in flames,
 we had to make
 a lookalike fire mask.
ROWLEY IRLAM: Are we good?
You can hear me okay, yeah?
I love-- I love what you've done with your hair.
BERIC DONDARRION:
It's a message.
From the Night King.
Being Beric Dondarrion, I'm always setting people on fire.
You have the mask off, you talk through it, what the process is gonna be.
Then we'll roll the cameras, okay?
The first three-two-one will be to light the sword, then it'll be three-two-one, action, for Nick to stab you.
You lift your arm up to stab on three, okay?
On action, he's gonna stab you.
Hold this position like this.
When you hear me start to count, that's when you start to react.
You then have to go and do it.
They'll gel you, they'll spritz you and they'll light you.
ROWLEY: One! Action!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, out, out, out!
LOWE: Well, you have an idea
 of what it's gonna be like
 but when I was set on fire,
 you've only got these little
 small eye holes.
All I could see were little flicks in my eyes of like a little bit of red.
And the first time we'd done it,
and like it went all, and they put me out, I said,
"Was I on fire?"
And they said,
"Yeah, it was massive."
JON: You've completely ruined horses for me.
It almost seemed like you knew where it wanted to go.
-Not quite--
-Aw, fuck!

-KIT: Fuck's sake.

We're shooting in Iceland!
Isn't it beautiful?
 We only have about six hours
 of light,
 so we all come out about
 3 hours before the sun rises.
 Grip and electric get to lay
about a 40-foot track, our department was laying down all the bones
 for our nest for our dragons.
BENIOFF:  Some of those locales
in Iceland are so breathtaking that real environments just help the actors so much, so if it's Kit and Emilia walking past a frozen river
 in Iceland
 and they're shivering--
 that's real.
Yeah, this fire lady, dragon mama is not used to the cold!
No problem, I can stand in the snow all day.
I just loved that I could go there with Emilia.
 I got to show this thing
 that's been such a...
large part of the Thrones'  worl
 for me.
I got to show her Iceland.
EMILIA CLARKE:
 Magic dragon ride!
I like it, it just felt like, a magic carpet ride!
We just sort of... playing tag on the dragons.
(CHUCKLING) It's beautiful.
FANGMEIER:
We were lucky to get a great day
of aerial photography in Iceland with a helicopter shooting these most beautiful river canyons
 with beautiful snow coverage.
 And then where they land
was meant to be a very pristine
 and gorgeous location as well.
Dan and David said,
"You know, maybe--
Can we have a waterfall here?"
 So, we went all the way
 to Iceland,
 to this beautiful canyon, and then we end up adding a massive waterfall
 later on in post because it still wasn't quite spectacular.
-Ooh! Ugh!
-(EMILIA YELPS)
DIRECTOR: And... let's roll, please, rolling rolling.
KIT: I think the actual
dragon ride was like... yeah, it's one bit where you gotta convey your love for each other and you're in a green box on a--
 on a buck.
So much of what we're doing now requires robotics.
 So we'll start with previews
 and in order to then shoot it,
 we'll go into a green screen
stage with a motion base, which is kind of like a mechanical bull, only in this case, it's got a dragon's butt on top of it.
 And then the cameras
 are swinging around
 on a 3D-controlled wire rig, programmed to match the previews.
Don't know how to ride a dragon!
Butt work is not easy.
 I think what sums up the buck
for me was... there was a bit where Jon almost falls off the dragon,
 swings around really violently
like this, and my right ball got trapped,
 and I didn't have time
 to say stop,
 and I was being swung around.
 In my head, I thought,
 "This is how it ends.
On this buck, swinging me around by my testicles. Literally."
(CHUCKLES) Sorry.
Probably too much information.
♪ (TENSE MUSIC PLAYS) ♪
KIT:  It's just...
 way too much to take.
 I was joking with John like,
 "How do you, as an--
 How do you receive
 all those bits of information?
 How would you possibly
 try and act that?
 When they've got death
 raining down at them?"
And suddenly he finds out the truth about his life, that he's not a bastard,
 that everything he's lived by
 is not the case.
And on top of that, the-- his new lo-- (SIGHS) his new love of his life is his aunt.
Like, I mean, I was like,
"Oh, come on.
This is an impossible task."
I wasn't a king.
But you were.
You've always been.
He wouldn't want to hurt Jon with it.
He would only tell Jon that if it were the truth.
 If there's one thing
 he knows about Sam,
 it's that Sam is a stickler
for facts, and Sam is very literal.
SAMWELL TARLY:
You've never been a bastard.
You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne.
KIT: A way to get around it
 was disbelief,
 like, "Sam's gone mad.
 What're you talking about?"
Quickly followed by it making sense and anger.
You're the true king.
Aegon Targaryen.
Sixth of his name,
Protector of the Realm.
All of it.
KIT: I don't care if you're
 my best friend in the world,
 I will... I will...
 knock you out.
How dare you tell this to me.
My father was the most honorable man I ever met.
Your father... Ned Stark, he promised your mother he'd always protect you.
And he did! Robert would've murdered you if he knew.
And the truth that Samwell tells Jon, is probably the most incendiary fact in the entire world of the show.
 Ned Stark understood
how dangerous the truth about Jon was, and that's why he protected Jon from it.
SAMWELL: You gave up your crown to save your people.
Would she do the same?

And it ain't a normal world.
Get used to it.
That's what Mister tells me.
We live by his rules
or we die.
Or worse.
We die and we come back.
But let's begin at the beginning.
I was like any other kid,
I had a family.
I went to school,
I didn't believe in the boogey man.
But then the world
woke up to a nightmare.
...Stay in your homes
and not to travel by night.

Maybe we should wait.
We'll take the back roads, you'll be safer there.
No. Martin, come back!
Hey!

Welcome to Stake Land, kid.
Months passed
in a blur of days and nights.
We traveled east and west,
but always north.
Away from death.
We avoided the cities.
Mister said they were the worst,
hit the hardest in the beginning.
As people flocked together
for safety,
the plague marched through
their locked gates
and they became death traps.
When Washington fell, it was over
for America as we knew her.
As government blew away,
our great leaders ran for it.
And hope was abandoned.
We were on our own now.
Me and Mister.
Traveling through a ruined land.
Pockets of civilization survived.
Towns locked down behind fences
and guns holding the night away.
Cults spread like wildfire
across the southern states.
Waitin' for the messiah,
but he never came.
Death came instead.
And it came with teeth.
Dumb fuck got himself trapped.
Burnt up in the sun.
Berserker.
It's the oldest of the vamps.
Can't stake 'em in the chest.
Got a breast bone like iron.
Gotta get 'em in the base of the skull.
Vamps... function from the reptile brain.
It's like pullin' the plug on a computer.
We were all orphans.
Just lookin' for something
to hold on to.
He's a Mister.
Maybe that's why
he keeps me with him.
What's that?
Garlic oil.
Does that really work?
Don't hurt.
One strike boy.
Make it true.
Where you boys comin' from?
South.
Get outta the car.
Did you get any?
They alright boys, let 'em roll.
Another town,
another lockdown.
People just tryin' to go on.
Hopin' they'd wake up
and it would all be a bad dream.
They could go back to their lives,
families and careers.
He needs more fresh food.
And some vitamins, if you can find them.
Where's his folks?
Dead.
He'd be better of here.
With people.
Other children.
What do I owe you?
I could use all of them.
Good.
Hey.
Got any liquor in this town?
Jake's.
Homemade, mostly.
We got some tap beer.
Little sour, but it won’t kill ya.

Where are you, uhh... where are you guys headin'?
North.
Uh, Mister says less population, less bloodsuckers.
Wait, wait, wait...
Not New Eden right?
We had a fella, he came through here.
He said there's nothing there, there's no food at all.
He said it's not the Vamps ya need to worry about... it's the cannibals.
Thanks.
Sometimes I think I could
stay in a place like this.
Make friends,
live in the daylight.
Just be a kid.
But the truth is
I don't feel safe around people.
They can think what they want
but New Eden was real.
It was the answer to all of this
and we were gonna find it.
Fight our way north,
make the open territories.
Like Mister says.
'Live free or die tryin'.
Fuck the cannibals.
What's her name?

Why did this happen?
How can God let this happen?
How can this be his love...

Got called back from the war when it started.
What happened with the war?
No one left to fight it.
The Middle East is gone.
Vamp land.
How did you end up here?
We were deployed to see to the evacuation to Canada.
Keep the peace.
But we couldn't contain it.

Vamps could smell blood
from miles off.

And so did Jebedia Loven.
I could tell by
the look in his eye.
We were movin' north.
Away from The Brotherhood,
skirting the Adirondacks
Less towns, less people.
Hadn't seen any vamps yet.
Mister said it was too cold for
them up here in the mountains.
They were cold-blooded.

Any trouble with The Brotherhood?
Nothin' we couldn't handle.

their town Strivington.

It gave me hope for people.
It gave me hope for New Eden.
Sometimes hope is all ya got.
And it was over, like that.
All that goodness.
Shattered by some Christian crazies
droppin' vamps from the sky.
We're gonna stay right here till morning.
Fine by me.
How you doin', mama?
She's gone.
Tough old lady.
Climbed those stairs and didn't say a word.
Damn Brotherhood shit-kickers.
Ten dead.
We've got things under control now.
We'll have this place up and runnin' in no time.
Sure you won't stick around for a while?
We could use a couple good men.
No.
We're headin' north.
Stick to the back roads.
They're the only way outta here.
Brotherhood owns the rest.
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
We'd come far.
We didn't know
what was waitin' for us.
But anything had to be
better than what we left behind.
At least I kept
telling myself that.
But when I close my eyes,
I kept seein' that
little girl's dead legs
stickin' out from under that tarp.
Ah, fuck.
What is it?
Fuckin' radiator.
Can you fix it?
Not this time.
She's dead.
Everybody grab your shit.
One week in the woods and
we were becoming different people.
Small talk stopped.
We worked as a pack,
each to his task.
It was cold here in the hot passes,
but we hadn't seen any vamps.
The forest cast
a kind of magic over us.
Away from people.
I stopped thinking
about the past.
And about my family.
I had found a new one.
You think we'll make it?
I'm just worried about the girl.
She's slowin' us down.
There's no wind.
Berserkers.
Run!
Come on!
We gotta run now, let’s go.
Move!
She's comin'!
No, no, no!
What are you doin'?!
What are you doin'?!
We gotta go!
Keep movin'!
- Please, Please. We gotta move.
- I need one second!
Sister?
I got you, I got you.
Just a little bit further.
Come on, keep moving.
She's comin'!
Keep going.
Come on, we gotta go.
We gotta go faster.
Come on, you fuckers.
The Lord is my strength.
My Lord is my...
Father, forgive me.
Martin, let's go.
I don't think she's coming, Martin.
Come on.
We've been travelin' for days
now and hadn't seen a soul.
It was like people
had just disappeared.
But Mister wasn't
takin' any chances.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm just getting old and scary.
You okay?
Oh, yeah...
Baby just kicked, I'm okay.
Here, give me your hand.
- Wanna feel?
- Yeah.
Oh, wow.
Let me check that out.
Here, give me your hand, wait.
That kid's got a strong kick.
She's like, "Let me out,
I wanna meet everybody."
Wake up.
Get your boots on and your guns ready.
Willie's missin'.
Something's dead.
It's fresh.
Jesus! Fuck...
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, my God...
Come on. Come on.
- Come on. We have to go.
- I can't.
Come on.
From now on you keep your weapons close and ready.
That thing took Willie away to kill him.
He got around our traps.
What are you saying?
This one uses its brain.
I've seen a lot of mutant vamps but I ain't never seen a thinker before.
We were entering the lowlands.
New Eden was just beyond
the mountains.
We were getting close.
But so far
no sign of anything...
Alive anyway.
- You okay, girl?
- I...
I have cramps.
My back hurts really bad.
I just...
I just need to sit for a minute.
I'm sorry.
- We gotta keep movin'.
- I can't.
It's okay.
I got you.
You okay?
My daddy used to carry me like this when I was little.
I'm not your daddy.
You ain't such a hard ass, you know.
Let her sleep.
She needs it.
At daylight were gonna put some distance between us and this place.
What are we gonna do when the baby comes?
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
This way. It's close.
That's her.
That's her.
Wait.
It's leadin' us, boy.
Tough shit.
Drink up, boy.
I am a vengeful god.
Eye for eye.
Tooth for tooth.
Son for son.
This is between me and you, you bloodsuckin' son-of-a-bitch.
When you left me for them,
I prayed.
I prayed and God listened.
So when they came for me, the hungry ones,
I gave my blood, willingly, hunter.
Thank you.
I am your God now.
Yah.
Nice try, child.
Try this, you fucker.
'Bout time you learn how to drive.
Almost there.
Almost.
'Almost' is a big word.
Fuck.
Hold it right there!
Don't move.
Thank you.
You boys look like hell.
Shit happens.
Yeah, sure does.
But like my mom used to say,
"Things are what they are.
Get used to 'em."
Smart woman.
She owned this place.
Last stop before the wilderness.
Buried her out back and
I've been on my own ever since.
Except for them.
It's good shootin'.
Lots of practice.
I'm gonna take a look around.
What's your name?
Martin.
I'm Peggy.
It's been a long time since I seen a boy.
Come on.
You gotta wait 'til it's in the lot.
What's wrong with it?
They're runnin' out of food so they're... skinnier but meaner.
It smells us now.
Oh shit.
It's Walter again.
I went to high school with him and I haven't been able to get a clean shot.
He was such an asshole.
I'll get him.
Martin!
No, stop!
Get in here.
What are you doing?
Martin!
The Vampire and Lycan
clans had been at war
for centuries before I was born,
their conflict
hidden from
the human world.
I was turned
by a Vampire.
Given the strength
to avenge
my family
against the Lycans.
And I was good at it.
Then I found Michael Corvin,
a human that was
turned to neither Vampire
nor Lycan,
but a hybrid
of the two.
Everything changed.
Allies turned
enemies,
and the Vampire elders I had
protected for over six centuries
wanted me dead.
We retaliated,
killed the elders,
and for a moment of time
we were safe.
But then
a new darkness arose.
In the nine days
since the first discovery of the non-human species,
scores of so-called "covens" have been uncovered.
Estimates of the number of infected have skyrocketed.
Military sources confirm
that the primary measures
of defense against the non-humans are
ultraviolet light and silver,
to which the infected appear to have fatal sensitivity.
Tents are posted at every barricade throughout the city.
A test will be administered
to verify
if you're clear of infection.
Spray her!
Spray her with silver!
- Get it out here!
- Help! Run!
No, no! Run!
We've begun our second attack wave
using ultraviolet
and silver-nitrate
munitions, which are
deadly to the infected.
Due to the volatile
situation,
martial law was declared two hours ago.
Many of us have
lost loved ones to this.
Please know that you cannot help them or yourself.
It's shocking
that not one
but two distinct
species may have been coexisting within human populations.
The existence of Vampires and Werewolves
now appear to have actual basis in fact.
The city remains reluctant to share new
information.
We are getting reports on what appears to be a mass cleansing.
Fire!
Get back! No cameras!
There's no cure.
There it is!
Engage contact!
- Man down! Man down!
- Cover me!
The Purge.
Human beings no longer kill each other.
We are the enemy they've been waiting for.
Escape has become our only chance of survival.
Therefore,
Michael and I are leaving tonight.
Halt!
Delta 6 in pursuit!
Stop! Get down on the ground!
She'll be here any minute.
- You be ready to go.
- Better hurry.
Tango Unit moving into position.
We have the hybrid in sight.
Hold your fire. Leave this one alive.
Delta in position.
- Watch your flank.
- Secure.
Move, move, move!
Alpha Unit in position.
Arming silver grenade!
Michael!
Fire!
- Move in!
- Alpha 4, move in.
Grenades, fire!
Retrieve the bodies.

- Over there by the chamber!
Don't let it get away!
Security violation, Level 6.
All containment personnel to Level 6.
Jacob.
Subject 2 escaped, it's in the building.
We've got Subject 1 in full lockdown.
- Give me the status.
- Subject 1 has broken free.
We need to flash-burn immediately.
No, wait. Let me see.
Open it.
Put it back to sleep.
Hurry.
Releasing
maximum dose of fentanyl.
What is this place?
Where's Michael?
No, no, no. No, no, no.
All non-security personnel clear the building!
Security command, outside now!
- There she is!
- Stop!
Don't move!
Multiple casualties on Level 6!
Medical to alert status!
Prepare for full
containment on Level 6!
I repeat, full containment
on Level 6!
I see her.
East corridor. Send security.
No. Let her go.
She'll lead us
to Subject 2.
No, don't shoot!
Let her go.
Attention, all units.
Subject 1 and Subject 2 have escaped the perimeter
and are no longer under Antigen control.
Secure the outer gates and use extreme caution upon encounter.
Report immediately upon coming into contact...
Hey, how did you get in there?
You're not allowed in here.
The pier is closed.
Since when?
A long time ago. (Some on.
How long?
About 12 years ago.
Since the cleansing. Why?
You okay, ma'am?
Attention, all units, code three call.
Receiving a report of an assault,
Exit 39 underpass.
Possible non-human aggressor.
Proceed with caution.
CDC already en route.
All area units respond.
Ma'am? Hey!
Ma'am?
- What are you doing?
- Stay there! Don't move!
- Identify yourself!
- Get back here right now!
Whoever it is, they couldn't have made it very far.
I'll alert CDC to keep an eye out.
They're en route.
There's no way this attack was human.
You don't know that.
Don't know what?
The guy's shredded.
His throat was in the gutter.
Just let me handle it.
What's to handle?
This has Lycan written all over it.
Detective, when was the last time you heard about a reported Lycan killing?
A couple years ago.
How many years have you been with this department?
What? I've been here for three months.
Exactly.
You question me less until you know a bit more.
We clear?
Crystal.
Detective Sebastian.
Detective, we've just received a report.
There's been a disturbance at Antigen Labs.
A witness says there was an escape.
They said someone jumped
out of a window.
This is a priority
investigation.
We need you over there ASAP.
We're on our way.
Hey, let's go.
Johnson, you're the lead.
You got it, detective. Will do.
Who's in charge?
There's a Detective Sebastian here to see you, sir.
Where is he?
In the lobby, sir.
You'll be relieved to know the situation is well under control.
What happened?
I repeat, well under control.
I repeat, what happened?
Ah, yes, there are reports to be filed.
One of our test subjects attempted to escape.
We were forced to put it down.
So nothing got out?
Only a stray bullet.
And the test subject?
Flash-burned.
Will that be all?
A few things to attend to.
You could imagine.
Doctor, we received an anonymous call that something else escaped through a window.
Detective, our mission at Antigen is to develop ways of preventing infection, not releasing it into the general population.
I lost my son to this disease.
There's no room for error with me when it comes to the safety of the public.
If something had escaped, the authorities would have been notified.
You are an authority, are you not?
Now, if you'll excuse me...
The guy in charge says it's nothing. Let's go.
Yeah, and he's full of shit.
Look at this.
Want me to report it, sir?
No. I'll do it.
I don't mind.
I can do it for you.
All right, sir.
The prisoner that helped me escape, the one you called Subject 2, was it a hybrid?
Yes.
What were you doing with us?
We...
We help the government identify the infected.
We were using your DNA to try to find a cure to prevent another outbreak.
You were told that I would lead you to the hybrid. Why?
Subject 2 is restricted information.
I don't have the clearance.
You're lying.
No! Aah!
No, please!
All I know is there's a connection between you.
Your brain waves fall into sync when you're close to each other.
You can see through each other's eyes!
Please don't!
I'm the one who let you go!
Now we're even.
What the hell was that?
Creepy is what.
I'm calling it in.
Let's go.
Shit.
Doni.
Why not?
We're the same.
Why are you following me?
We monitor the police frequencies.
Well?
Do you know what attacked that human under the bridge?
No.
Lycans.
What remains of them, yes.
They've been hiding down here like rats since the Purge.
Diseased and starving, they rarely show themselves above ground.
Which means that something has got them riled up.
Something you're not telling me.
Michael!
Do you know her?
No.
They will come back in numbers.
We can't leave her here.
Come on.
Let's try the van.
Get in. Move! Move!
Three of them behind us.
Go!
Hurry, Selene!
They're getting in the back!
Fucking piece of shit!
The girl! They're taking her!
You drive.
She's not healing.
We have a doctor that can help her at our coven.
How did you find me?
What's your name?
Subject 2.
And you are Subject 1.
I freed you.
Do you not know who I am?
They told me that I had no mother, that she died when I was born.
I never believed it. I...
I felt you.
Saw images through your eyes.
But then someone outside my door, they said since I was no longer a child, the wait was over, that I'd be dead soon.
And that my own mother, right next door, would never even know
I'd existed.
What did they tell you of your father?
They must have told you something.
Do you see images through him?
No.
Only you.
No, please!
She's never stepped foot outside the lab.
How can she possibly survive?
I understand the risk of reporting her escape to the authorities.
No record of her birth.
Questions will be asked.
I'm well aware of that.
But if she dies, all our years of research...
Rather than tell me how to do my job, why not take a look at your own professional conduct?
And how your continual need to endow this creature with human traits has led to the laxness of its security protocols.
It's not a human being, Lida!
It's not your child.
It's not to be coddled.
It's a blight of nature.
Stop worrying.
It'll come back to us.
Get Olivia at once.
Again you break my rules. Why?
She was attacked.
She is not healing.
And for this you compromise our safety?
You have no reason to fear us.
Do you think I'm foolish enough to take you at your word?
No reason to fear a Death Dealer who fell in love with a Lycan, who murdered two of our elders, and who, at every turn, has betrayed her own kind.
Do you know who this is?
Yes.
But it was we who betrayed her, Father.
Let her through.
She's not healing.
She was attacked by a lower Lycan.
Two hours ago.
Her cell repair is active but weakened.
She has no origin bite marks or scars.
I've never seen a child like this before.
When did you last feed?
Feed?
Give her blood.
Child, you must.
Slowly.
Slowly.
There.
There, now.
She's healing.
- And quickly.
- Good.
Take her to my room.
She needs to rest.
No.
Look at the eyes.
I never believed it.
They do exist.
This is not one of us.
No, it's something more, Father.
What do you know of her?
I was held captive at a place called Antigen.
One of the other prisoners freed me.
I believed it was Michael Corvin the only hybrid
I knew existed at that time.
Yes, yes, your Lycan lover, long dead.
What is this, then?
None of your concern.
As soon as she regains her strength, I will leave with her.
I used to hear stories of the Death Dealers.
That they were a thing of the past, never to return.
I'm glad they were wrong.
You knew who I am... and yet you still brought me here.
Thank you.
You're a fighter.
We could use more like you to teach us.
I'm not sure your father would agree.
There was a time when he would have.
That's why he dislikes you so much.
I think it reminds him of the days when he defended us with fire and steel rather than hollow words.
He knows how much we need you.
I'm not a leader.
But you fight for what you believe in.
You always have.
I don't know what I believe in any more.
I don't recognize this world.
But you haven't changed.
I saw it in your eyes when you looked at the child.
You will protect her.
It's in your blood.
It's who you are.
When you leave, take me with you.
You distrust me.
Of course you do.
I made you feel unwelcome.
And for that, I'm sorry.
Ah.
Those eyes, they're special.
I know exactly what you are.
My father says that, should we survive as a species, these relics will help our descendants know who we were and how we lived.
And what do you say?
That if we continue to live as we do now, then we disgrace the past and don't deserve a future.
We must resist the humans wherever and whenever possible.
Between the first and second Purges,
Lycan youth rallied in the same way against the prudence of their elders.
Their calls for violent action carried the day.
The result?
The Werewolves are nearly extinct.
Is that what you wish for us, extinction?
Yet you bring her offspring into our home.
Do you honestly believe the humans will allow her to remain free?
They will hunt her down at any expense.
- Then we can help protect them.
- Protect them?
They leave tonight.
This isn't prudence.
This is cowardice, plain and simple.
How dare you?
How dare you do so little?
I dreamt of the day we would meet.
Like a silly little girl.
You're as cold as one already dead.
Yesterday
I was with your father.
He was only a little further away from me than you are now.
I went to sleep.
And when I awoke the next day,
I learned that, overnight,
12 years had passed.
And instead of the only man
I've ever loved, there stood a girl with his eyes.
My heart is not cold.
It's broken.
I'm so sorry.
What is it?
They're here.
Stay here. Wait for me.
No, take me with you.
Please.
I won't let anyone hurt you. I promise.
Lock the door.
Everybody to the shelter. Now!
No!
Prepare the armory.
Do as I say! Go, 90!
Pay heed to me!
No! We stand and we fight.
No! Have you no sense?
Stop this now!
We lived safely for years and you brought humans into this coven.
They want the girl.
They'll stop at nothing to get her.
This day was bound to come, with or without us.
Let's move!
Munitions, let's go! Everyone!
Are you mad?
We have no more than a handful of fighters. We will be annihilated!
And what's your plan, Father?
Let's go! Now!
Where are you going?
To get her away from here.
He's right. I shouldn't have come.
He doesn't understand.
The humans will follow us out.
Hold them off till then.
They're only here for her.
She's more powerful than any of us.
They fear the day she discovers it.
I have to get her out of here.
Lycan!
Silver ammunition!
Now!
Defend the second rotunda!
Move! Move!
Open the door!
Let's go.
Move! Move!
We need to go.
What the hell was that?
Take her somewhere safe.
No.
Take her. Go.
Where is she?
They took her.
They accepted her.
As a gift from me.
Do you know what you've done?
Do you have any idea?
What would you have had me do?
Fight to the last to protect the very one who brought this upon us?
We're defeated.
Our coven is destroyed.
My son is dead.
Because of you.
Why?
Because he helped that child of yours.
If they kill her, so be it.
Your son died because he was fighting for all of you.
Because he knew that running is not survival.
Those were Lycans.
Not extinct.
More powerful than ever.
That thing was more than twice the size of any Lycan I've seen.
They risked showing themselves after more than a decade in hiding because of her.
And you handed her over to them.
She is the last direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus.
The only hybrid child that has ever existed.
Whatever it is the Lycans want from her, your son knew it was worth dying for.
What are you doing?
David.
A force of two dozen Lycans attacked and destroyed one of our covens last night.
You're not surprised.
You knew the Lycans were not extinct.
How?
Just a feeling.
I'm not good with feelings.
I want to know how.
This is not the place for this.
And you're not gonna kill me.
Really?
No.
Because you wouldn't need a fucking gun to do it.
A few years ago, the government declared
"mission accomplished" on Lycans.
The feds announced that we were to only focus on your kind now.
Three months ago, a friend of mine sent me this.
It arrived two days after he was found hanging from his own ceiling fan.
Two hundred suspected
Lycan captures.
Every case was investigated.
Every blood test came back negative.
My friend began to wonder:
Were they all false leads or was someone trying to protect the Lycans?
Helping them replenish their packs, letting them regroup.
What about your own department?
They have my daughter.
All I care about is getting her back.
If you're protecting someone, I don't care.
I'm not after them. I just want her.
No.
Even if there are others in my department, they wouldn't have the authority.
This goes much higher.
I believe, all the way to the top.
Or to the bottom.
What do you mean?
Who administers the tests?
We're a bit short on time, so if you please, take a look at these.
This schedule takes you from the moment we adjourn through to the final manufacture of the vaccine.
If we stick to this plan, inoculations should begin within three months.
Any questions, now's the time.
After today's surgery, there will be no communication between us until we meet again in the inoculation center.
Doctor, in terms of your test subject, he continues to demonstrate immunity to silver?
Absolutely.
And additional inoculations, administered only as a precaution, triggered side effects we never imagined.
Vast increases in strength, muscle mass, self-healing.
Stamina.
You said she was essential to our research.
- Yes, and will continue to be.
- How?
By vivisecting her?
You weren't meant to have that.
I cared for this little girl all these years, and you expect me to sit by while you...
Harvest its genetic material?
I expect nothing from you.
I hired you to look after it, and for the most part, you did an excellent job.
Saving the lives of thousands.
What are you talking about?
An entire species saved from extinction.
Jacob.
After today, you won't have to wait so long between injections.
Are you sure she's ready?
Estrogen levels high, intervals between menses holding steady.
It's come of age.
Everything's worked out just as we'd hoped.
You're the first proof of it.
I'm proud of you, son.
Now that it's with us again, we'll have all the genetic material we need, ready for cloning.
Enough to produce an endless supply of vaccine.
Imagine.
Our species immune to silver.
No more hiding.
Every Lycan under our command as powerful as you are.
I've even begun injecting myself.
I only wish Mother were here to see it.
Your mother chose to remain human.
She abandoned us.
Remember that.
Of course, Father.
Look, if you're right about Antigen, who knows how many Lycans will be hiding in there?
The second you step foot inside, you'll be surrounded.
I'm hoping so.
I know you want her back.
I can help you.
Why?
Just tell me what your plan is.
It's worse if you try to fight it.
Trust me.
So how is it you're actually able to survive in the sunlight?
It was a gift.
From a man named
Alexander Corvinus.
The founding father.
I used to be married, to a nurse.
One day at work, she was bitten.
Nobody knew but us.
We lived like that for a few years.
Then came the Purge.
The feds were conducting door-to-doors and when they knocked on ours... well, she told me she loved me... and then she let the sunlight in.
I had to watch her burn.
Okay.
You got me?
Yes.
Good luck.
Shit. It's her.
In daylight?
It's her!
- Go!
- Okay.
Wait for my cue.
I'm ready.
Ops Code A. Repeat, Ops Code A.
Breach on Level 1.
Intruder ascending in Elevator 4.
I want all levels ready on that elevator now!
Anesthesia ready?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Security units on alert.
Ops Code A.
Intruder on premises.
Secure the east wing.
All units, intruder's ascending
in the elevator.
Come on.
Let's go.
Move!
There's your cue.
Copy.
They're using silver-nitrate gas.
Bombs on all the floors.
It's Subject 1. We need to evacuate.
Fine.
Start a propofol infusion.
We're not canceling this procedure, understood? We're moving it.
You find her and you destroy her.
With pleasure.
I'm here.
I got movement on a van in.
Parking Level 3.
No sign of the girl.
They'll be on the move.
Just don't lose them.
She's in the service elevator.
Get her.
I'm coming down.
Selene. Selene!
They're heading for Parking Level 2.
Selene.
I need to know
where you are!
Ah, shit!
Do you copy?
Selene, where are you?
I see her. I see her.
Parking Level 2.
They're loading her into the van.
Selene, where are you?
Fuck it.
Hold it right there!
Stop! Stop now!
Michael?
Get her!
Take her out!
Selene, Lane has her
in the van.
They're on the move. Where are you?
They are leaving with her!
Do you hear me?
I'm on my way.
Come on, faster.
Don't stop.
Hit him!
Selene, they're heading for Parking Level 1.
Aah!
Selene, they're getting away on Parking Level 1. Do you copy?
I'm coming.
Everything okay?
Levels are holding stable, sir.
Baseline vitals...
Fuck you.
Get away from her!
It's worse if you try to fight it.
Trust me.
I heal instantly.
I'm counting on it.
You came back for me.
I said I would.
Selene.
You should go.
There's a safe house not far from here.
Go. I'll send them on a different path, buy you some time.
Thank you. Come on.
David.
Are we going back in?
We are.
What is it?
Michael?
The roof.
Though the world has changed, our enemy remains the same.
The Lycans
will rebuild.
And will hunt for her father as they did
for her.
But as they grow stronger,
so will we.
The Vampire coven will not only
survive this world,
we will reclaim it.
Man:
The year was 1978 when the killing spree of
John Wayne Gacy finally came to an end, as Chicago police arrested him and began digging up bodies he had buried under his Summerdale house.
Man #2:
Many called it the crime of the century.
Some of the bodies were clothed and three of the bodies had ropes around their necks.
Woman:
He killed 33 times and his victims were all boys and young men between the ages of 14...
Man: He says he's a victim for being found guilty and he says the families are victims because they don't know who the real killer is.
Woman: Testimony provided a frightening view inside the mind of the worst mass killer in American history.
33 families...
Woman #2: When you have a child taken out of your life, it's like a huge piece being ripped out...
Woman #3: Cook County sheriff's deputies investigating the disappearance of a teenaged boy made a gruesome discovery in the crawl space beneath a Chicago residence.
The owner of the house is local contractor
John Wayne Gacy.
The bodies of 28 victims have been recovered...
Man: He knew exactly what he was doing; he planned it in advance; he carried it out and he enjoyed it.
Man #2:spree was initially uncovered on a cold December day when the first of his victims was found in the crawl space beneath his suburban Chicago home.
Woman: In the crawl space, bodies covered with lye dug up a few days before Christmas, one after another.
The bodies of 28 victims have been recovered; another five retrieved from the Des Plaines River...
Man: Tuesday, four bodies;
Wednesday, six bodies; and today, six bodies.
Man #2: Skeletonized remains of human bodies.
Reporter: At one point he told police how he murdered his victims.
Now he's telling me he never did.
John Wayne Gacy was convicted in 1980 for the rape and murder of those 33 boys and young men, many of whom he buried under his Chicago house while others were found in the Des Plaines River.
That was 13 years ago and today attorneys have filed their final appeal with the Seventh Circuit Court while Gacy remains on death row at the Menard Correctional Center in Illinois.
The US Court of Appeals upheld his conviction and death sentence, a move that could clear the way for his execution within...
Who are they talking about?
Gacy.
He just filed his last appeal.
Reporter: About what it's like to be waiting to die on death row.
Due to be executed in six months...
Feet off the coffee table.
Gacy: No, I don't sit around worrying about the death penalty.
See, I'm a PMA kind of person... positive mental attitude.
I don't have time for negative thinking and death...
This guy's been in prison since '78 and they're just gonna kill him now?
The reason it takes so long is
'cause of our appellate system.
Reporter: And refuses to cooperate with law enforcement.
This thing that I did... no, if I'm guilty of anything, it's operating a funeral home without a license.
And you want a career in law enforcement?
These people are so incompetent.
Okay, Mom.
Gacy:
They had no confession.
I'm an embarrassment to the criminal-justice system because it's easier to kill me now than to admit that they screwed up
15 years ago.
Reporter: Authorities have tried on numerous occasions to elicit a detailed confession from Gacy, but he has remained tight-lipped about the crimes ever since his conviction.
With time running out for the death-row inmate, the truth may never be revealed.
Antisocial Personality Disorder, or APD, is characterized by a lack of regard for the moral or legal standards in a given culture.
There's also an inability to get along with others as well as to abide by societal rules.
Now individuals with this disorder are often referred to as psychopaths or sociopaths, but in fact we know...
Yes, Jason?
Doesn't the DSM have a broader APD category that includes people who commit illegal, immoral or self-serving acts, but they're not necessarily psychopathic?
What's the DSM?
Oh, would you care to enlighten the class, Jason?
Sure, it's the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders.
And although it has some problems with reliability and is considered culturally biased, it is the major resource for mental-health professionals.
- Well, thank you, Professor Moss.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, that's not precisely correct, but I'd say it's close enough.
Uh, okay look, we're going over, so why don't we stop there and we will pick it up again next week?
Thank you.
- I'll catch up with you, okay?
- Girl: Okay.
Professor Harris?
Can I talk to you about the term paper?
Term paper? That's not due till the end of the year.
Yeah, I know. I just... I want to get a head start on it.
Sure. What's your question?
So I want to do my paper on John Wayne Gacy.
Gacy?
What's the angle?
- Um...
- (door closes)
Well, there's a thousand angles that could be explored... um, capital punishment from the perspective of a death-row inmate; does Gacy fit the typical FBI profile of a serial killer?
And he's... he's scheduled to be executed in six months, so he might be more willing to talk to me.
You know, Jason, I've read a hundred papers on serial killers and quite frankly, I think the topic's overexposed and trite.
You're gonna have to demonstrate a really strong academic angle here.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll work on it.
I'll get back to you.
And don't forget, this paper counts for half your final grade.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not worried.
Woman:
Hi, Mr. Gacy.
Gacy:
So where's the big guy?
He had to make a delivery but he should be back soon.
What kind of damage is he looking to do now?
I think he was talking about tearing down that back wall by the storage area.
All right, I'll go take a look.
How's it going, pal?
Hey.
Girl:
Did you get your Christmas bonus?
No, not yet.
- You?
- No, not yet.
Boy:
Well, it better come in soon.
How much you make an hour here?
You know, I pay my guys $7.50.
Really?
You interested?
Oh shit.
Hey.
Where the fuck were you?
I know, man, I'm sorry.
I got held up.
Look at me. Hey.
What the fu...
Alex, why does that guy keep fucking with you?
Just drive, okay?
I want to get out of here.
- Later.
- Bye, Alex.
I'm sorry I was late.
You guys are late.
Jason:
I know, Mom. It's my fault.
Alex, take your hat off at the table.
It's not polite.
- So how was school, boys?
- Jason: It was good.
Good.
Did you hear me?
Father:
Alex, do what your mother says.
What the hell happened to your eye?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
It doesn't look like nothing to me.
Jason, what happened?
It's not a big deal, Mom, okay?
He just got into it with some kid at school.
You should see the other kid.
Alex really held his own in there.
- I don't support violence in this house.
- It wasn't in this house.
Don't get smart with me.
Pass the salad.
- So guess what?
- What's that, Jason?
I'm gonna write a letter to John Wayne Gacy.
Father:
And who is John Wayne Gacy?
He's a psychotic murderer, Frank.
You don't know who
John Gacy is?
So why are you contacting this psychotic murderer, Jason?
For my criminology class.
Cool.
Does he write his letters in blood?
Mother:
Frank, are you hearing any of this?
Come on, Valerie, what's the point?
Let him write the letter.
Probably won't even write back.
- I don't care. The answer is no.
- Valerie...
- No, I'm telling you...
- Jason's voice: Dear Mr. Gacy, my name is Jason Moss and I'm an 18-year-old college student.
I'm writing because I thought you might get bored or lonely where you are and might want someone to correspond with.
I've been seeing you on TV a lot lately and I wanted to talk to you directly as I'm sure most of what the media says about you is a lie.
At the moment I live at home with my family.
And if they found out I was writing to you, they'd probably kill me.
But my mom is pretty much against everything I do anyways, so what's the difference?
I have to admit that
I'm really not much of a student.
I barely graduated from high school, so it's a miracle I even got into college.
But I'm just gonna go for a year or so to appease my parents and then when I can get enough money together
I'll move out.
I can't wait.
At this point, I don't really know what else to say until you write me back.
If you should need anything like paper or supplies, just let me know.
I'd be happy to help.
I'm sure there are many others who write you, but I hope you take the time to write me back.
You'll see that
I'm a pretty nice guy.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Your friend, Jason Moss.
Gacy: Look, Sam, I need to know how long this habeas corpus review is gonna be.
I mean on average... how long does it take?
I know that, Sam.
I'm just trying to figure out how much time it's gonna buy me, you know?
I know you're working hard.
I know that.
Listen to me, buddy, you've got to know that I'm counting on you here, pal.
All right, all right.
All right, keep me posted.
If you hear anything, get back to me.
Good news?
He's an attorney; there's never any good news.
But no worries.
You know me, Stan.
I got friends in high places pulling strings for me.
I'm sure it'll all work out then.
Yeah, it's no problem, buddy.
Man on TV:
...and his motive unclear.
In the summer of 1985,
Southern California was held hostage by a rabid creature of the night, a phantom killer who cloaked himself in darkness and soon became known as...
What the fuck?
Look at this.
- What is this?
- It's a questionnaire.
Where'd you get it?
It's from John Wayne Gacy.
The serial killer?
Yeah.
I told you, I'm writing him for my criminology paper.
No you didn't.
I didn't? Really?
Look, you know, I probably didn't think it was a big deal because I never thought he'd write me back, but...
"What's your relationship like with your parents?
Do you have a girlfriend?
How often do you masturbate?"
That's disgusting.
Why are you writing to this guy?
I just told you... it's for my paper.
You couldn't think of anything else to do your paper on?
No, this is what's intriguing to me.
You're not really gonna tell him about yourself, right?
No no.
That wouldn't be the best approach, would it?
Jason: So I see Victor Leon Carsenos is back on your most-wanted list.
Didn't you guys arrest him in '92 for felonious homicide?
Yep, but he got off on a technicality.
So what's the urgency, Mr. Ross?
Uh, it's... it's this, sir.
And it's "Moss."
- A questionnaire?
- From John Wayne Gacy.
Okay.
I wrote him for my criminology term paper and he sent me that back, so I was hoping the FBI would be able to give me some more information on him.
Well, unfortunately you're barking up the wrong tree, son.
We don't have any information here on John Gacy.
If we did have anything, it'd probably be at the Chicago bureau.
Really? 'Cause, well, he lived here in '62.
He worked part time as a janitor at a funeral parlor.
And then shortly after that, he was convicted of child molestation for which he served only 18 months of a 10-year sentence.
Mmm.
Well, you know so much about him, what do you need me for?
Well, I was hoping you could tell me something I didn't already know.
Look, son, like I told you before, we don't have anything here on John Gacy.
And the only thing I heard about him was about some kid that claimed he had an encounter with Gacy.
But that was all over the news when he moved here, so I'm sure you already know about that.
An encounter?
Like what do you mean... he survived an attack?
Who was it?
I don't remember the kid's name.
Have you guys ever tried writing him from a potential victim's perspective?
All psychological profiling's done out of Quantico, so you'd have to talk to them.
Yeah? Okay, do you have someone
I can contact there?
Listen, kid, you're what... 18?
Go get laid.
Find a party, have fun.
Don't get caught up in all this shit
'cause it's only gonna lead to trouble.
Write your term paper about legalizing marijuana and go be a teenager, for Christ's sake.
Okay. Well, thank you.
Man on TV: So tell me about your relationship with your father.
I could never get along with my dad.
I mean, he was always just too overbearing.
I was always dumb and stupid.
I would never amount to anything.
So I said to hell with it.
I remember one time I was rasslin' around with some older kids and I passed out.
So I was always more or less a sickly kid, you know.
And I guess that embarrassed him.
Man: Okay, so you continue to deny the murder of those 33 young boys, but how do you explain the bodies found beneath your house?
Gacy: The state wants you to believe this fantasy theory, right, that the motive was sex and that they were all killed so that they couldn't tell anyone what they saw.
That's ridiculous.
It doesn't hold water.
The facts don't match the fantasy.
Which raises the question who John Gacy really is... the 34th victim.
Man:
Are you a homosexual?
I would definitely not be homosexual.
Now I have nothing against the things that they do and I openly admit that I've engaged in sex with males.
But I would be bisexual.
I mean the idea that
I'm some crazed homosexual killer strolling around the streets stalking and murdering young altar boys is ludicrous.
Hell, if you could have seen my schedule, you'd know damn well
I was never out there.
I would definitely not be homosexual.
Now I have nothing against the things that they do and I openly admit that I've engaged in sex with males.
But I would be bisexual.
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
Since when does
Jason lift weights?
Since now, okay?
Hey hey, go get your camera.
I need you to take some pictures for me.
Of what?
Come on, let's go.
- This is ridiculous.
- Would you just hurry up, please, before Mom comes home?
Why are you trying to look sexy?
Because, buddy,
Gacy's a homo so I need to look like a homo, do you get that?
- Come on.
- This is so disgusting.
Just take the picture.
Oh, wait wait wait.
How are my abs? Are they good?
I'm not gonna look at your abs.
Alex, could you just help me out, please?
I need to make sure these come out right, okay?
- Your abs look fabulous.
- Thank you.
- Okay, one more, one more.
- (camera rolling)
How'd that look?
Gay.
Perfect.
- Open D-32.
- (door buzzes)
Hey, Picasso, your mail's here.
How's it going, buddy?
Another clown, huh?
Well, that's what the people want, Stan, that's what they get.
How else could I be able to afford this lavish lifestyle in here?
Speaking of lavish lifestyle, your Cubans came in.
Oh yeah? Great.
Well, back to the grind, huh?
Where are you off to in such a hurry?
I thought maybe we'd kick back and smoke a couple of these babies.
You know the rules.
Hey, Stan?
Rules are meant to be broken.
So why are you here?
- Best to your family, pal.
- Close D-32.
Jason's voice: My relationship with my parents is not the greatest.
My mom is always on my ass trying to control my life.
My dad's normally more passive.
However, he has a temper and loses it once in a while and can beat my ass pretty good.
Nobody knows I'm thinking about being a nude dancer to earn extra money, which is a bit tight for me right now.
I don't even know why I'm telling you all this.
I guess I just feel like
I can open up to you.
Well, I really want us to become friends.
So I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
Yours, Jason.
Gacy's voice: One of the things you should know about me is that I'm open-minded, outspoken, not very tactful, nonjudgmental, liberal, and I say what I mean.
The only thing I ask is don't assume anything of me.
If you're not sure, then ask.
Nothing offends me and nothing is personal.
No subject is off limits as long as you're willing to be just as open and honest as me.
Jason's voice: I want you to feel free to say what is on your mind, good or bad.
Even if it's 20 pages long, I want you to tell me everything about you.
Don't worry about what I might think.
I am truly fascinated to know about the ideas, thoughts and emotions that enter your mind.
I am a very liberal person.
And since you said you will not share my letters with anyone,
I feel I can confide in you, as I hope you can also do with me.
As far as sex goes,
I haven't done a lot.
I don't have a girlfriend or anything, but I have an open mind to try many different things.
Gacy's voice: You want my opinion on something, that's what you'll get.
I want to know all your innermost feelings and thoughts.
What do you fantasize about?
You say that you're thinking about hustling for money, I say go for it.
But you have to promise you'll tell me all about it. Don't hold back.
I want details... everything.
You and I are gonna be real close, buddy.
Professor Harris?
Professor Harris?
Yes, Mr. Moss?
Hi. I wanted to share my new angle with you.
- What's that?
- Well, read it.
A letter from Gacy?
- You got him to write to you?
- Yeah.
Okay.
What are you gonna do with it?
I'm gonna get information out of him that no one else has been able to... not the police, not the FBI, not even his own wife.
I'm gonna get inside this guy's head and figure out what makes him tick.
Well, that's quite a lofty goal, Jason, but I still don't know what your paper's about.
Well, my paper is about journeying into the mind of a serial killer.
Is that a strong enough angle for you?
Okay, Jason, you're going to do what you want anyway, so go ahead.
But don't let your ego get in the way of your instincts.
This guy's talent is fooling people into trusting him.
Yeah, but that's also his weakness.
He's so convinced he always has the upper hand, he wouldn't even for an instant think that one of his potential victims could be way ahead of him.
I'm working on a strategy.
I even found a guy who survived an attack.
You give me a couple of weeks and I'll have him eating out of the palm of my hand.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, Mr. Phillips?
Hi, I'm Jason Moss.
I'm a student at the university.
- I'm doing a paper about John Gacy...
- Not interested.
Whoa whoa, hey hey!
Just hear me out.
Get the fuck out of here.
I'll just take up five minutes of your time, I promise.
Come on, you know him a lot better than I do.
I just want to figure out how he operates.
What part of "Get the fuck out of here" don't you get?
Look, I wrote him, okay?
And he wrote me back.
Look.
He's very interested in me.
Yeah, of course he's interested.
Listen listen, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.
I just... you know, I thought you could help me figure out who I'm really dealing with here.
I hope you never find out.
Hello?
Operator: I have a collect call from inmate John Gacy from the Menard Correctional Center.
Will you accept the charges?
Yes yes.
Uh, yes, Operator, I accept.
Operator:
Go ahead, sir.
Gacy:
What's up, buddy?
Hey.
Wait.
How did you get my number?
It's not listed.
I told you I got friends in high places.
What's the matter?
You don't like surprises, Jason?
No.
Uh...
Gacy:
So what are you doing right now?
I'm just sitting around watching TV.
Well, I was...
I was sleeping.
Oh, the time difference, that's right.
Sorry about that.
I don't really sleep too much.
Jason:
No no, no problem.
So what were you doing?
Out late banging your girlfriend?
Uh, no.
I told you, John,
I don't have a girlfriend.
That's right. That's right.
I can't believe I'm actually talking to you right now.
I know this must be awkward for you, but just try to relax, you know?
Tell me about your day.
How's school?
You still flunking out?
Don't feel bad.
I was never much of a student myself.
My teachers were all assholes.
You asked about a sense of power.
Now I think everybody feels that when having sex.
The power to get somebody off with your tongue is wild.
I could even see doing that to you and having fun.
Holy shit, John, it's almost 7:00.
Shit, my parents are gonna kill me when they get this phone bill.
Don't worry about that, buddy.
I'll send you money for the calls.
Jason: Wow, that'd be great.
Thank you.
I've got your back, bud. Hmm?
I know money's tight for you now.
Yeah, it is.
You should think about going out hustling like we were talking about.
A pretty boy like you would make a lot of money.
Jason:
Yeah, probably.
Well, do it.
Talk is cheap, man.
Why don't you go out tonight?
Okay.
Okay, I will.
- Yeah?
- That's a good idea.
I'll give you a call tomorrow at 4:00.
You can tell me all about it.
- And Jason?
- Yeah?
I want to hear every last detail.
Okay.
Bye, John.
Jason, you are a fucking genius.
Gacy: If you're hustling on the street, location is crucial.
Don't pick an area that's too busy.
And watch out for the cops, those fuckers.
Wear something nice, like a pair of cut-off shorts to show off your sweet ass.
And you want to walk in a way to attract attention.
Be sexy.
Try working your hips.
And when you approach buyers, remember to be flexible.
They've got the money so they're in control.
And they're gonna want to do it all... fuck you in the ass, the mouth; want you to fuck and suck them... all of it.
You're there to provide a service.
It's nothing personal.
But make sure you get paid upfront.
There's a lot of fucked-up people out there in the world that are gonna want to take advantage of you, so always watch your back.
Excuse me?
Well, look what the cat dragged in.
Meow.
Um, I was just wondering if l...
- Oh, and he's shy too.
- (all laughing)
What's your name, kitty cat?
It's Ja... Jack.
(laughs) Cute.
So?
So how do you want it?
No, actually, I was wondering if I could pay you just to talk to me.
No, see, I'm a student.
I'm trying to write a paper...
- Oh, hell no.
- Wait wait wait, hey hey.
- Wait wait.
- You a pig?
No no, I'm not.
I just want to ask you some questions.
Okay?
I have money. I can pay you.
Look.
Come on, "Ja... Jack."
I know the perfect place.
So is this... is this where you take most of your customers?
Hey, this is my special friend.
Get him a drink.
So tell... tell me about your approach.
Like what kind of language do you use?
You know, the terms you use for describing your various services.
Drink up.
Ahem.
Like what do guys usually ask for?
Most guys just want a blow job or they just want to be the top man.
Sorry, what? "The top man"?
You really don't get out much, do you, kid?
That's where they get to do me from behind.
That costs the most.
I get it all though... everything from guys paying to suck my dick to me fucking them up the ass.
Anyone ever try to hurt you?
I was sucking some guy off when he put a knife to my throat.
I tried to finish him off and get out of there, but he fucking cut me anyway.
Was he trying to kill you?
This is fucking boring me, all right?
Finish your drink.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
This is my special friend.
Trust me. Go ahead.
Trust me.
Jason.
Oh God.
Hey.
You okay?
You didn't show up at class. You haven't missed class since third grade.
Yeah, I was just feeling a little tired.
Hey, come here.
Give me your hand.
Come here, sit down.
You know, Jason,
I don't think this Gacy thing is healthy.
You know... oh God.
Listen, if you're here to lecture me,
I'm just not in the mood for it.
No, I don't want to lecture you.
I'm concerned about you, Jason.
You haven't been the same since you started writing to this guy.
I just don't have the strength for this right now. Can we do it later?
- No, you keep putting me off.
- Yeah.
I want to know what's going on with you.
This isn't fair.
I just... I'm feeling... I'm feeling like
I might throw up.
I'm feeling really sick, so...
- maybe if... if you could just go?
- (phone ringing)
If you could just go, we'll talk about it later, okay?
- Fine.
- Thank you.
- I hope you feel better.
- Okay, thanks.
- Hello?
- Operator: You have a collect call from inmate John Gacy from the Menard Correctional Center.
Will you accept the charges?
- Yes yes, I accept the call.
- Thank you.
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.
So how'd it go last night?
Uh, not good, John.
What happened?
Well, I picked this guy up on the street, right?
And we went to the club, we had a drink.
He offered me $200 to be his top man.
But when I stood up,
I realized that that fucker had drugged me.
Oh shit.
So what'd you do then?
I ran.
That fuck stole my wallet too.
That pussy cock motherfucker.
You want me to have him taken care of?
What do you mean?
I know a lot of people out there, Jason.
They'll find this cocksucker and they'll cut his dick off.
I'm very protective of the people that I'm close to.
No no, John, don't worry about it.
So why weren't you more careful about who you picked up?
I told you you've got to learn to read people.
You've got to figure them out before they figure you out.
You've always got to be five steps ahead of everyone, so that you're the one who maintains the control.
I watch people very closely when they don't know I'm watching them.
I try to figure out where they're going, what they're thinking, what's really going on in their mind.
By observing their behavior, you can learn what their weaknesses are, their vulnerabilities, their fears.
And once you get into their minds, you've got the power.
- Jason: To do what?
- Gacy: Anything you want.
Jason: Well, John, thank God
I've got you to talk to about these things.
I'm learning from the best.
Gacy:
We're a lot more alike than you think.
I just taught you.
Now it's your turn to teach me.
What I want to learn all about is that little brother of yours.
Hey!
Hey. (chuckles)
- What are you doing?
- Nothing nothing.
- What are you doing?
- I just got out of class.
Cool.
Listen, I'm sorry about the other day.
I was just... I was feeling out of it.
I'm much better now though.
Good.
What are you doing?
Do you want to go hang out?
Yeah, I have to study, but maybe you could come with me and we could get a movie or something after?
Yeah yeah, that sounds good.
- Cool.
- Okay, come on.
(whispering) Hey.
So if opposite charges attract and two like charges repel each other, what is the nature of their mutual interactive force?
What do I look like to you, an encyclopedia?
- Hmm?
- Jeez, somebody's cranky.
Get out of here.
Don't. Get out of here.
We're in a library, okay?
What the hell are these?
Would you give me... give 'em!
They're for my paper.
- For your paper?
- Yes, for my... for my paper.
I posed like this when I first sent Gacy a letter so he'd write me back.
I can't take any more of this Gacy shit, Jason.
- It's gone too far.
- Would you keep your voice down, please?
- What is the big deal?
- What is the big deal?
My boyfriend is posing seductively for a serial killer in prison and you don't think it's a big deal?
People already think you're gay, Jason.
I don't give a shit what people think.
- Are you gay?
- Am I gay?
You know what, Alyssa?
You can go to hell.
Fuck.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You wanted to borrow this, right?
- Oh yeah. Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.
So l...
Gacy was asking about you.
- Gacy?
- Yeah.
- Why me?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I'm still trying to figure it out.
- But well, he wants to talk to you.
- I'm not talking to a killer.
I know.
Look, I think I can get around it if he just gets a letter from you.
I'm not writing him a letter either.
I'll write the letter.
Okay? All you have to do is just copy it in your handwriting.
Why do I have to get dragged into your shit?
Come on, Alex man.
My plan is working here, okay?
I'm getting him to open up and give me a lot of really good information.
I don't want to lose him now.
Alex, please, man, just... just this one time, okay?
Come on.
Please?
Alex, just this once, okay?
Fine.
Yeah?
Thank you.
Jason: Dear John, I am so fucking pissed off right now.
My father beat my ass again last night.
I fucking hate him.
I'm so sick of feeling this way.
I can't trust anyone.
I'm not sure I even want to live anymore.
What would you do if someone beat your ass?
Gacy: I've thought many times about killing myself, but the Bible preaches against taking your own life.
Then again, sometimes it's the right thing to do.
Jason, your life will hit rock bottom some day.
And when the time is right, you'll know what to do and how to do it.
But don't worry, Jason.
I'm here for you.
I'm your friend, your only friend right now.
~ Fall on your knees ~
~ O, hear the ~
~ Angels' voices ~
~ O night ~
~ Divine... ~
Gacy:
It's kind of tough around here.
A guy can't even get off in peace.
I got 24-hour whack-off patrol up my ass.
So listen, John... can I ask you something?
Do you feel any remorse for killing all those boys?
Jason, I never killed anyone.
Look, I took three and a half hours of truth serum and they found that I had no knowledge whatsoever of the crimes.
Yeah yeah, but would you feel bad if you did?
Gacy:
Why would I feel bad?
Those hustling bitches got what they deserved.
Nobody asked them to go out there on the streets selling their asses.
They were just begging to be killed and that's exactly what they got.
No, but they weren't all prostitutes, John.
There were other kids too.
Gacy: What kids?
I don't know what you're talking about.
How did you lure them into your house?
What was your method?
Gacy: You can get anyone to do anything you want if you play on their fear.
And the feeling of energy you get from someone's fear is unlike anything you could ever imagine.
Tell me about that.
I don't want to talk about all this negative bullshit.
What I want to talk about is that skimpy letter your brother Alex sent me.
I thought you told him that I wanted more details.
I did, I did, John.
But he... you know, he's stubborn.
I can't control him.
He does whatever he wants.
Gacy:
Oh really?
Well, you said to me, and I quote:
"My brother looks up to me like I'm a hero.
When I tell him to jump, he says, 'How high?"'
Well, he hasn't been in the best of moods lately, John.
He keeps getting his ass kicked every day, so just cut the kid some slack.
What the fuck is he getting his ass kicked for?
What is he, some kind of a pussy?
No, he... no, he's not a pussy.
He just... the other kids are a lot bigger than him.
Oh, fuck that.
You need to jump in there, Jason.
You need to be a fucking man.
You get a 2x4 and you crack this cocksucker's head open if you have to.
You don't want people saying that the Moss brothers are a bunch of pussies, do you?
No no, of course not.
Oh, Jason, you and I are a lot alike.
But your brother Alex... now he's not as strong as us, you know.
So he needs to be led by example.
And the same thing applies to the bedroom.
You know?
I've been giving this a lot of thought lately:
You know, you two, you can get each other off just as well as anybody else can.
You know, your brother, he's in a bad mood
'cause he obviously isn't getting any.
Don't you see what a waste that is?
Nobody would ever have to know.
All you gotta do is slip into his bed one night and start rasslin' with him till you get him hard.
And then you let your head drift down into his crotch, and then you put it in your mouth.
And then he'll resist and he'll fight at first.
But after awhile, he'll get into it and he'll let you finish the job.
You know what, John?
My mom's coming. I gotta go.
Fuck.
- This is Jason. Leave a message.
- (machine beeps)
Operator: I'm sorry, sir, there's no one available at this number.
Please try your call again later.
Professor Harris:
All right, that's it, people.
Don't forget the due date of your term paper is coming up and I am expecting nothing short of brilliance.
Goodbye.
Jason?
Can I see you for a minute?
So what's up?
You're missing class. And when you are in class, you don't ask any questions, not that I miss that.
I think maybe you got involved with something that...
You're not my father, okay?
I get enough of this shit from my parents.
You're gonna get your precious term paper, but in the meantime, just get off my back about it.
- (beeps)
- What?
Operator: You have a collect call from inmate John Gacy from the Menard Correctional Center.
Will you accept the charges?
- Yeah, I accept.
- Thank you.
Jason, where the hell have you been?
I've been calling you for days.
Well, I've been busy, John. Okay?
I have a life, you know?
What did you do?
You find someone else?
- What are you talking about?
- What are you, writing to another inmate?
What, I'm not good enough for you anymore?
John, John, it's not like that, okay?
You think you can just ignore me?
That's not how it works.
You don't play both ends against the middle with me, you little shit.
- I won't tolerate it!
- Hey hey hey, John, just calm down.
Do you have any idea who I am and what I'm capable of?
Because I know who you are and where you live.
For all you know, I could have somebody sitting outside right now watching you and your family.
What are you talking about?
Gacy: You know exactly what
I'm talking about.
Don't play me, Jason.
Remember who I am.
How could I forget?
And don't go taking your friendship away from me and I won't have to take something away from you, you got it?
Yeah, I got it.
Remember who I am.
Always remember who I am.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck.
Jason: Oh, you think you scare me, huh?
You think you scare me?
Huh? Well, I got you, you fuck.
FBI!
On the fucking ground.
Put your fucking hands up!
On the ground!
- (knock on door)
- Who are you talking to?
No one.
Why isn't the car washed? I asked you to wash the car before we left for Grandma's.
- I am not going to Grandma's.
- What do you mean, you're not going?
It means I'm not going!
Look, I just have a lot of important things on my plate right now.
I can't be worried about going to Grandma's house.
- Oh really?
- Yeah.
Well, then maybe your father and I should stop worrying about paying the bills around here and you can start fending for yourself.
Yeah, maybe you should.
Fuck.
Hey, where are you going in such a hurry, faggot?
- None of your business.
- Huh?
- Fuck off, Marcus.
- Come on, man.
Get the fuck out of my face.
Oh, you're fucking dead.
- Man: Hey hey!
- Jason, what the heck?
Jason, that's enough!
Stop!
Stop it, let's go!
- Hey! Hey, you two!
- Alex: Come on.
Ah!
Hey, Jason.
Jason?
- What's with him?
- What else is new?
Where have you guys been?
You know I wanted to leave before it gets too dark.
We got held up.
Why does he get to stay?
Because your brother's going through some teenage life crisis.
Go get your bag.
Let's go.
Sure, let's just worry about psycho Jason.
Go get your bag.
Go!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Jesus!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing with a gun?
Well, there's been a bunch of break-ins, so we... we got it to protect ourselves.
Oh.
Hey, do you want to come in for a second?
I mean, as long as you're here, you know?
Okay, just for a second.
Hello?
Operator: I have a collect call from inmate John Gacy.
Yes, I accept.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Operator: Go ahead, sir.
Jason, they denied my appeal.
They're gonna kill me in six fucking days.
My fucking piece-of-shit lawyer said it would never happen.
John, John, slow down.
I can't understand you.
- No, wait, Alyssa, don't leave.
- Forget it, you made your choice.
Jason, are you listening to me?
They're gonna kill me in six days!
Okay, John, slow down. Alyssa!
- Who the fuck is Alyssa?
- Jason, forget it! I'm done, okay?
I thought you said you didn't have a girlfriend.
- It doesn't matter, John.
- I thought you were my friend.
I thought I could trust you.
Wait wait, what are you saying, John?
You pussy-whipped little cocksucking piece of shit!
John?
- Fuck!
- (clatters)
Fuck!
The room is nice. I like it.
I always close the curtains too.
So?
Jason: On the bed.
How original.
Take off your stockings.
How do you want it?
Lie down on the bed... on your stomach.
On your stomach.
- What are you doing?
- Just stop talking.
I'm not comfortable with this.
- Just stay still.
- Motherfucker, let me go!
- Shut up, shut up.
- Stop it!
Someone... no! No!
- What are you fucking doing, huh?
- Stop!
What are you doing?
Just shut up.
- (screams)
- Shut up. Shut up.
Shut the fuck up!
- (crying)
- Shut up.
Gacy: Jason, there's a lot I want to get off my chest before I die, and you're the only one I can trust.
Yeah?
Like what, John?
I can't tell you over the phone.
I need to see you in person.
I'll even let you see my top-secret files.
And don't worry,
I'll pay for the whole trip.
It'll be fun.
It's perfectly safe too.
I mean, there's cameras and guards.
I can even have the warden call you if you want.
- The warden?
- Yeah, he can tell you how safe it is.
I already spoke to him. He said that he would be pleased to talk to you.
Would you like me to have him give you a call?
Sure.
Great.
I look so forward to meeting you, Jason.
- (pounding on door)
- Jason: Hello?
Open up, please!
I need to talk to you.
Look, Gacy is gonna be executed, Glen.
I need to talk to you.
He wants me to come visit him.
Aw, fuck.
I'm sorry to keep bothering you.
I know how hard this must be.
I need to figure out who I'm really dealing with here.
And nobody knows that better than you do.
So you're gonna go see him?
I don't know.
That's why I came here.
You can't go there.
Why?
Tell me what happened.
You want another Scotch?
- Glen: Yeah.
- Bottoms up.
Boo.
Glen:
What are you doing?
Just clowning around, buddy.
I'm just clowning around. Oh.
You would be surprised all the tricks you can do when you're a clown.
You want to see a magic trick?
Here you go.
Huh? Go ahead.
Put 'em on.
Make sure they're nice and tight.
- Yeah.
- Ready?
Huh?
It's your turn now.
Go on, put 'em on.
- Go on.
- What's the trick with these things?
- The trick is to have the key.
- (record scratches)
I've got something real special for you now.
I told you to shut your mouth, you pathetic little cocksucker!
No. No.
Hey hey, relax.
You're really gonna enjoy this.
No! Let me out of here.
Let me out!
I got this specially picked out for you.
- (ripping)
- Ah ah ah!
- Come on, step that fat ass up.
- Ah! Please.
Please let me go.
Please.
I jumped from the car.
And I broke seven bones in my body and I didn't feel a thing.
I hope that this helps you make the right decision.
Hello, Mr. Moss, this is Warden Michaels from the Menard Correctional Center.
I understand you have some questions for me.
Yeah yeah, I was thinking about visiting John Gacy and I just wanted to find out how safe it would be.
Well, Mr. Moss, there are a lot of safety precautions here at Menard.
Jason: Well, is he going to be in the same room as me?
Warden: No, you would be in two different rooms with a glass partition between you.
Mr. Gacy will have his arms and legs shackled and there's a... there's a camera in the room where the visitor is seated that is monitored at all times.
Jason:
And what about the guards?
Well, there'll be a number of guards and you'll be under constant surveillance.
If there are any problems, a guard will be right there.
There hasn't been an incident here at Menard in many years.
Security is just too tight.
You trust me... you'll be completely safe.
- Jacket too?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Step through, please.
Arms up and out to the side.
- Follow me.
- (door buzzes)
He's all yours.
Sign here, here and here.
- What is this?
- A release form.
For what?
It says we're not responsible.
Excuse me?
In the unlikely event hostages are taken inside the prison, we won't negotiate for your release.
So what you're saying is that if someone were to take me hostage, you'd let them kill me before you did anything to save me?
Exactly. Sign there, please.
- Have a nice day.
- Mr. Moss?
Officer Thompson.
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Gacy is very excited to see you today.
That's good.
Right this way.
Go ahead.
Jason, oh my God.
It's so nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Look at you... you look great.
Hey, Stan, would you mind taking a picture of Jason and I?
- Yeah. Sure, John.
- A little something for posterity.
Something to remember me by.
Excuse me, guard?
- Where are you going?
- Have fun, boys.
Whoa whoa, hey hey hey!
What are you doing?
Where are you gonna be if I need you?
Jason, come on, relax.
Everything's okay.
Please make yourself at home.
Sit down.
I mean, seriously, sit.
It's all right.
Hey, can I have the guys bring you a pop or a chocolate milk or something like that?
- No. No, I'm good.
- You sure?
Yeah.
God.
This is perfect.
I can't believe you're here.
I mean, look at you.
Thank you for coming.
You know? Seriously, bud.
Yeah, no problem, John.
You know, I just wanted to be here for you.
I appreciate that, you know?
So tell me about yourself.
Hey, you're not out there hustling anymore, are you?
- No no no, not too much anymore.
- Mmm.
So how's the girlfriend?
Alyssa, right?
Yeah yeah, she's good.
She's still there.
Yeah?
Giving her the old hard one?
What's all this stuff?
Oh, this is everything I promised you.
Here, check this out.
Got everything... newspaper clippings, notes from my trial;
I got letters from "Inside Edition," channel 7, all wanting interviews with me.
Look at all these letters.
I get thousands of them, you know?
I get 'em from all kinds of people... movie stars, rock stars, porn stars, politicians, women.
You know?
Here, check this one out.
See this trailer-park bitch?
She's got two sons incarcerated right now.
She says she wants to have my baby.
Can you imagine?
Why would I ever want to get mixed up with trash like this?
Wait, it gets better. Here.
This is her sister.
They've offered to give me the classic ménage à trois.
Can you imagine? Between the three of us, all this blubber moving around?
You look good.
Really.
This food's not so bad.
The fellas treat me pretty good around here. Isn't that right, Stan?
You got it, boss.
- Jason?
- (door closes)
I ordered this dessert especially for you.
It's my favorite... strawberry shortcake.
I'm full, John.
Thanks though.
So John, you know how at your trial, you said that you didn't kill all those boys under your house and someone else must have done it?
I want to try to find that one statement.
I mean, who do you think did it,
John, if it wasn't you?
Do you have any idea how weak you are?
I could just tell you to fuck off right now... and you'd have no one.
What would you do without me?
I don't know, John.
Where would you be without me?
You know, if I was a bad guy,
I'd tell the police what you do with your brother, they would take him away and you would go to jail.
Yeah, but you wouldn't do that to me, right? Hmm?
I didn't say I would do it.
Just remember who I am.
I know who you are.
John, we're buddies, right?
That's right.
That's right.
So... tell me, did you have a smooth flight?
Yeah yeah, it was fine.
There was no problems.
And did you get that painting that I sent you and the travel money?
I did. I did. Thank you for that, John.
I really appreciate it.
Of course.
I've got your back, pal.
Yeah.
So, John, you said you had some things to tell me when I got here.
You know, some things you wanted to get off your chest.
Yeah.
Do for me and I'll do for you.
John, tell me about that kid you admitted to killing.
Okay? The one that you picked up at the bus stop and had sex with.
Oh.
I woke up and he was standing over me with a knife.
He was gonna rob and kill me.
I didn't have any choice.
Yeah, well, if it was self-defense, John, why didn't you just call the police?
Well, the son of a bitch, he shouldn't have attacked me.
But he wasn't attacking you.
Right? I mean, wasn't he just making your breakfast?
What the fuck are you talking about?
You don't stand over a man with a knife when he's sleeping.
So what happened after you stabbed him?
Nothing happened.
Let me tell you something, Jason:
You can always tell when a man is dead because he shits all over himself.
The little cocksucker stunk up the place so I buried him in the crawl space.
How did it feel to kill that kid?
Did you feel powerful?
Jason, Jason, you have no idea the power you feel.
- How'd I feel?
- Yeah.
I felt fine.
I slept fine.
I am fine, aren't I?
Thattaboy.
Let me tell you something.
Do you have any idea how long it would take the guards to get here if you screamed?
Maybe one or two minutes.
I could kill you right now if I wanted to.
You know that, don't you?
Huh? You know that?
Yeah, John.
But I got other plans in mind for you.
You see that table there? Look.
That's where I'm gonna do you.
And after I'm done, I'm gonna wrap my hands around this throat and I'm gonna squeeze until it breaks.
John, John, John, why are you talking to me like this, huh?
(mocking) "John, John, why are you talking to me like this, huh?"
You know something, Jason?
In person you are really a disappointment.
Oh, you know what you are?
You're a little pussy boy, huh?
A little pussy boy.
A little pussy boy.
Here you go.
- It's black. Where's the cream?
- Well, I forgot.
Check out monitor 3.
It's kissy time.
- (laughs)
- That's fucking sick.
Leave the guy alone.
He's gonna die in a few days.
Least we can do is let the poor fuck get his rocks off one more time.
- Doesn't mean I have to watch.
- Then don't watch.
You bitch.
You like getting fucked, don't you?
Like when you're hustling and selling your sweet little ass on the street?
Well, now you're gonna get what you've been asking for.
What the fuck are you doing, John?
Shut the fuck up!
God!
All right, that's enough.
This is over!
Who the fuck are you to tell me it's over?
I'm not who you think I am,
John, all right?
Guards, open this fucking door!
You know how many little pussy boys like you died for this cock?
Huh?
Get on your fucking knees.
Fuck you.
Now open your mouth.
Open your fucking mouth.
- I said open your fucking mouth!
- God.
You fucking piece of shit.
- It hurts to let the demon in, doesn't it?
- (door buzzes)
- But you feel good.
- You mother... I'll fucking kill you.
- Get off him, boy.
- I'll fucking kill you.
- Let him go.
- You fucking little cunt.
Who's the clown now, John?
You fucking piece of shit.
- You'll be there with me!
- Fuck you.
I told you we're alike.
We're exactly alike!
Valerie:
Jason?
It's okay.
Oh, Jason.
This is Jason. Leave a message.
Gacy:
Jason, it's me.
Pick up.
What's wrong?
I don't understand.
They're gonna kill me in a couple of days.
Why are you abandoning me?
What is it?
What did I do?
Was it the little fight we had?
If it is, l... I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm really sorry.
John?
You little cocksucking jackoff.
Do you have any idea who you are fucking with?
I should have choked the life out of you when I had your throat in my hands.
You know what I'm gonna do, Jason?
I'm gonna send your letters to the cops and the FBI.
I'm even gonna send a copy to your parents; let the whole world know what a sick perverted cocksucker you are.
You want to send those letters to my family, then the police, John?
Well, go ahead.
Because everybody up here knows that
I was just studying you for school.
You were an experiment, John.
I was playing you from the start and you were too stupid to figure it out.
What do you have to say now, John?
Female reporter:
Tonight I'm standing outside
Illinois's Stateville Penitentiary where John Wayne Gacy will be executed for the 33 murders he was convicted of 14 years ago.
Three drugs will be administered in 30-second to one-minute intervals:
Sodium Pentothal, an anesthetic; pancuronium bromide to paralyze the respiratory system; and potassium chloride to stop the heart.
If all goes as planned,
Gacy will be pronounced dead within 10 to 15 minutes.
Jason?
- (knocking)
- Jason, come on.
- Jason?
- Jason: Just go away.
Male reporter:
...from the scene.
And some of the families of Gacy's victims are present for the execution.
One family issued a statement saying,
"Nothing will ever bring our son back, but after 16 years, justice is finally being served."
Meanwhile, protesters...
We've just received confirmation that John Wayne Gacy succumbed to lethal injection and was pronounced dead at 12:58 AM, nearly an hour after his scheduled execution time.
Cheers from the crowd were heard when his death was announced while others continued their protest in silence.
So I have read your term paper.
And?
And it's very good.
Thank you.
So do you really think you were able to get inside his mind?
Uh... as close as anyone can get.
Well, listen, obviously you've been talking to a lot of people about this because there is a lot of buzz on campus about your project.
I know some of the other students have been talking about your letters and even some of the faculty are aware of what you've been doing.
I was wondering, would you be willing to put on a small presentation for the department?
Nothing too formal... just talk to us about what you learned and how you developed this rather unusual methodology.
Jason: While this sociopath was trying to humanize himself to me, the images of the boys he killed never left my mind.
Their innocent faces still remind me of just how unthinkable these crimes were.
And the losses that these families suffered should never be forgotten.
We live in a society that is fascinated by murder, killing and violence.
So I thought I was just one of many with a morbid interest in the darker side of human nature.
But I also wanted to conquer something that I truly feared.
Instead of running away from this monster, something told me
I should confront it and look it in the eye.
When I first embarked on this journey to enter into the mind and manipulate one of the world's most notorious serial killers,
I never imagined that the one who would ultimately be manipulated and controlled would be me.
Thank you.
Very good, Jason.
Well done, Jason. Very good.
Gacy: Well, Jason, you really took me for a ride.
You were right,
I never saw it coming.
Of all the people who fucked me over in my life,
I never thought it would be you.
But it must have been fate.
Thousands of people wanted me, but I picked you.
We had a real connection, the two of us.
And now that I know the truth,
I know more than ever that you and I are a lot more alike than you think.
It's time to die now.
See you on the other side, buddy.
I portrayed an image to Gacy of this lonely boy that had no friends.
I wanted someone to teach me or help me.
I presented myself as very naive.
I didn't want to just learn about Gacy.
I wanted to actually talk to him, find out about his crimes, find out the things that no one else could find out about.
I thought, "I'm gonna find the secrets that the FBI couldn't figure out.
I want to do what the psychologists failed to do."
And every letter I got back, I thought that was one step closer to finding out why Gacy buried those kids.
But he was also a part of my life for seven months.
He was my friend, my confidant, the subject of all my nightmares.
But it's weird to know that he's gone.

Hey, you guys ready to order?
Uh, sure.
Okay, Priya?
Uh, I'll have the shepherd's pie.
You want to split that with me?
Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.
Why not?
Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust.
Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled
Macy's Day balloon.
Not quite accurate. The Macy's balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.
So, no, on the shepherd's pie.
Can we move on?
Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yogurt.
Do not believe it.
Sea bass!
I'll have the sea bass!
You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.
Kill me.
It wouldn't help.
The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
Guys, sorry I'm late.
I have amazing news.
Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on
Leonard's faulty digestive system?
So, what's your news,
Bernadette?
The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation.
I'm getting my PhD!
Wow!
Oh, congratulations.
Wow, so that means you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.
Congratulations, honey.
Thank you.
So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing that when you two get married, you'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?
Unless he takes Bernadette's last name.
And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.
Please, this isn't about me.
I'm proud of you.
Well, you'll be really be proud of this.
I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company.
They're gonna pay me a buttload of money!
What?
Bernadette, that's great.
Howard, do you make a buttload?
Better than what you've got a buttload of.
Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything's peachy.
If you do it, you're still not a doctor.
Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal.
It helps, but everything is not "peachy."

Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.
You look beautiful,
Lieutenant Uhura.
Now prepare for... inspection.
Shh, my brother's going to hear you.
Relax, he's got headphones on.
And we're ten miles above
Earth in a starship.
Really, ten miles?
You're orbiting inside the atmosphere?
Moron.
I can't believe
I'm wearing my brother's Halloween costume.
I can't believe you think he only wears it on Halloween.
Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.
Okay, gotta go.
Hey, what's up?
Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?!
No, Ma! It's Raj!
He's a doctor too, right?!
Yes!
Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!
Sheldon, yes!
Everybody's a doctor but me!
Well, whose fault is that?!
What's up?
Leonard's putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress.
Can I stay here tonight?
Sure, but I'm going out with Bernadette.
It'll just be you and my mother.
I guess that's okay.
Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!
Of course, he and I can play doctor!
She's kidding, right?
I don't know, she's pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.
Paging Dr.
Cutie Pie!
I must say, Amy,
I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.
It's indeed admirable.
Although, it is... microbiology.
Your doctorate is in neurobiology.
I fail to see the distinction.
I'll make it simple for you.
I study the brain, the organ responsible for
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite.
Is there something wrong with your neck?
It's a little stiff.
What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload.
Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
Have you considered massage?
I'd like to respond to that sarcastically:
Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.
All right.
Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.
Rotating.
You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
You mean the myofascial point?
Obviously.
Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes!
Amy, I've never been touched like this before!
Oh! My hands are magic!
Don't flatter yourself.
Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system.
I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
There's someone at my door.
That doesn't interest me.
Good-bye.
- Can I sleep here tonight?
- Why?
Leonard's having astronomically inaccurate
Star Trek sex with my sister.
I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in.
I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
Oh, don't bother.
I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.
No, I can't authorize that.
Well, he's in my bed.
Why can't I be in his?
The Hammurabic Code is
"an eye for an eye," not "a bed for a bed."
Come on, dude, I'm exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night's sleep.
All right.
This is a form indemnifying me from your use of
"Leonard's bedroom."
Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.
Good night, Sheldon.
Wait. Not yet.
We still have to go over safety procedures.
Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here.
In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.
You're kidding.
I never kid about safety.
What are you doing here?
I was sleeping.
In my bed?
Well, I would've slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family.
And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.
Oh, you heard?
"Scotty, I need more power."
Sorry. Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here?
Are you kidding?
He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR.
Thank God he had a dummy.
Oh, yeah.
Mouth-to-Mouth Mona.
You know, she used to date Howard?
Oh, my God, she's that Mona?
Why can't you and my sister spend your nights here?
We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.
Sheldon doesn't get along with Sheldon.
It's still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
Okay, well, how about this: until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I'll stay at your apartment.
Can I bring girls here?
You?
Sure. Bring as many as you want.
Okay, deal.
Just not against their will.
You really think you should be eating that cake?
Why?
If you're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.
He's right.
A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.
Yeah, ha-ha.
First of all, I'm not threatened by my fiancée's success.
I'm proud of her.
And secondly,
I have my own career.
Until you have kids.
Good news, Raj.
I got the blood work back from the lab.
You're okay to stay for a while.
When did you take my blood?
Not important.
Your sugar was a little high.
I'd follow up with your regular physician.
In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.
What the hell is this?
Boilerplate stuff.
A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest.
And a living will and durable power of attorney.
This says you can make nd o of li" decisions for me.
As your friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Please sign.
Did you sign this?
There's a reciprocity clause.
You get to pull the plug on him, too.
Well, that seems fair.
Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard.
Here's your I.D. card, your key and your lapel pin.
Which Leonard was too cool to wear.
FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.
Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.
Also, you're tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners.
Tonight is Thai food.
You'll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server.
If you have any questions, here's the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch,
I do a live web chat called
"Apartment Talk" on Tuesday nights.
No backsies.
Sheldon, dinner!
What is this?
This is the difference between eating and dining.
Remarkable.
I'm just realizing how much
Leonard's been skating by all these years.
It's not a big thing.
Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?
Yes, it's "Penny, get your own Wi-Fi." No spaces.
Thanks.
Wow! What's with the fancy spread?
My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.
Uh, nice touch, by the way.
What do you mean "new roommate"?
What happened to Leonard?
The same thing that happened to Homo erectus.
He was replaced by a superior species.
I'm the new Homo in town.
That came out wrong.
All right, let me try this again. Where's Leonard?
He's living at my place, so I'm living here.
You're living here provisionally.
But I must say it's looking good.
Oh Leonard and Priya are living together?
That's big.
No. Origami napkin swans... that's the headline.
It's a good thing.
So do you know what kind of research you'll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project.
I mean, it's not like either one of us has heart disease.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you a little present.
Oh, Bernie, no.
You didn't have to.
I wanted to.
Come on, open it.
You bought me a Rolex?
How much did this cost?
Oh, you let me worry about the money.
I just want my baby to have pretty things.
More wine?
Oh, no, no, no. I've had way too much already.
Here's an interesting fact about alcohol...
Hit me.
Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated.
Can you guess what the other is? sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.
Monkeys.
When does a monkey have a trunk?
When a suitcase just won't do.
Mmm, all right.
It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence.
Good night.
Please note, it is now past 10:00 p.m.
Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.
Okay... explain something to me.
You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years.
What has to break inside your brain for you to think,
"Oh, Krishna, I've got to get me some of that"?
Well, it's a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.
What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah.
Leonard's a noisy little dude in the sack.
Every night.
Really?
Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?
It's my sister. Can we not talk about this anymore?
Yeah. Sorry, sorry.
Can I tell you a secret?
Yeah.
I screwed up.
Leonard's a great guy.
Never should have broken up with him.
Well, uh, to paraphrase
"It's better to have loved and lost
"than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography."
Ohh... you poor baby.
What's wrong with me, Penny?
Nothing, nothing.
You know, if we weren't friends, and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story,
I'd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.
Hey, you totally got that right!
"E=mc2."
I listen.
I have no idea what it means, but I listen.
To friendship.
To friendship.
Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking?!
And the answer was elephant!
Mmm.
Mmm.
Leonard, sweetheart, we're kissing, not eating hot soup.
Sorry.
That's my parents on video chat.
Go hide in the bedroom.
Oh, come on!
Why don't we just tell them that we're dating?
Oh, we've been through this.
It's not the time.
When is the time?
I've got five brothers and sisters.
One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I'll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.
Fine.
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City.
Is that close to you?
No.
Where is your brother?
Out with friends.
I don't like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.
I'll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.
You're moving back to India?!
Who's that?
Oh, my God! There's someone in your apartment.
Call the police in America!
When were you going to tell me about this?
Oh, hello, Leonard.
What a pleasant surprise!
Mummy, Daddy, you remember
Rajesh's friend Leonard.
I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.
He has many friends.
Rajesh has many friends?
Why are you lying to us?
She's lying because she doesn't want you to know we're dating.
Leonard!
Well, what difference does it make? If you're moving back to India, we're obviously breaking up.
You know what?
I don't want to deal with this right now.
So...
Hot in India?
Of course it is.
It always is. It's India.
Now, what do you have to say for yourself?
Uh...
That is a beautiful tapestry.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Oh.
Okay, look.
This never happened.
Do you understand me?
Really?! Still can't talk to me?
What are you doing here?
What?
I said, what are you doing here?
I live here.
I have paperwork that says differently.
Priya's going back to India.
Irrelevant.
Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you're not going to ruin it.
What are you doing here?
I've been up all night.
- I had a fight with Bernadette.
- Why?
She gave me a beautiful watch.
Leonard, do you understand this?
Yes.
Talk to him.
Damn.
What's going on?
Oh...
It's-it's not what it looks like.
What does it look like?
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
- Need a hand?
- Um... yeah. Sure.
Thanks.
It's just through here.
Hey. Hi, buddy.
Hey, Dex.
Boy, it's a hot one, huh?
Yeah.
Do you have fish?
No. Take a closer look.
Hey. Good boy.
Stick insect.
- Stick insect?
- They're actually very friendly.
George.
Mary.
Want something to drink?
I think I got juice, maybe beer.
Oh, no, I'm okay.
I'll just let you carry on.
It's fine.
- Thanks again.
- Okay.
Hey, um, that stick insect?
How do you know it's being friendly?
I have no idea.
She loved you too.
You let me go on loving you, waiting.
Also, why did you try to kill something that can't ever die?
I needed you then.
I need you now.
I'll always need you.
I knew it all the time.
Hello?
Hello?
Is that 722-5795?
- Yeah.
- Is Bobby there?
No. I just moved in.
Maybe he had the apartment before?
Mr. Davies, anything you wish to add?
Like I said, Your Honor, um... my client feels a restraining order... to be an unjustified stain on his character... and would like to have it lifted at first opportunity.
Noted.
There's also the matter of the family pet.
I've made my position clear on that.
But my client would like to know, if there's any...
Counselor, Miss Kee keeps the dog.
Mr. Kirby.
Your Honor, the divorce papers.
Your Honor, there's been an unforeseen delay.
I will send them right over.
You can't be here.
Just wanted to drop them off myself.
Figured it was the least I could do.
Oh, there's the bad boy.
Yes, it is.
Daddy's home.
Yes, he is. Yes, he is.
You signed them?
We had some good times, didn't we?
How about work?
They're being understanding.
You are going back, right?
Not yet.
Has he called again?
How about going out, meeting people?
He said if he couldn't have you, no one else would.
You live like this, in fear, he's won.
Come here, come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Question nine:
Edinburgh is the capital of which country?
Ireland.
- Scotland?
- That's what I meant.
Is the correct answer.
Hello?
May I speak with Bobby, please?
There's no Bobby here.
May I ask who you are?
Who I am?
Is this a joke?
Did Steven put you up to this?
Would you do me a favor, please?
Tell him Rose called.
I'll be in Frank's at 8 if he wants to see me.
Rose, this friend of yours?
He really isn't here.
And, you know, like I said,
I moved in a couple of days ago.
I walked past the house last night.
I saw him right there in the window.
- You have the right address?
- El Falansterio, L-2.
Just tell him Frank's at 8, okay?
Frank's at 8. Sure.
If a guy called Bobby passes by,
I'll tell him whatever you want.
Hello.
Hi.
There are strict rules in this college... about perpetuating age- or gender-based stereotypes.
Excuse me?
It would be a breach of guidelines for me to suggest... that you may have mistakenly wandered... into Math for Stage Two Mechanical
Engineering here in 14-A... as opposed to, for example...
Conversational French?
In 14-B.
Well, as it happens, I was wanting to pursue a course on Math for...
Stage Two Engineering.
But having heard there's a course on Conversational French...
I hope you won't be too offended.
A little disappointed, maybe.
Excuse me.
What?
You look tired.
Hello?
Bobby says he doesn't know you.
Bobby's right.
You should listen to him.
And while you're at it, check his goddamn number.
You think I'm mad at you, don't you?
But I'm not.
He's using you. It's what he does.
Normally I like talking to crazy people, but I'm kinda tired today.
Wait, don't hang up, please.
Please.
Look, there's been a mistake, a crossed line or something.
He said he loved me.
Rose?
I'm sorry for what's happened.
But your friend isn't here and I don't know you.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
No harm done.
What's your name?
Mary.
Mary.
Mary what?
Mary Kee.
He asked me to marry him.
Lucky you.
The day he got back from Vietnam.
Came by in his uniform, got down on one knee.
Vietnam? You mean the war?
Oh, he didn't wanna go.
He was drafted.
How old are you?
Forty-one.
Rose, the Vietnam War was, what, 35, 40 years ago?
You would have been a child.
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
What did I ever do to you?!
We're sorry.
That number is unobtainable.
Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I wasn't thinking. I shouldn't have just...
Wait let me help you with that.
- How was... how was French?
- I have to go.
- I really didn't mean to scare you.
- I have to go.
You trying to steal my job, young lady?
Do you do the weeding around here?
I sure do.
What do you call this?
Oversight.
Pack up your desk, mister.
You're fired.
Wow, you're a hard one.
Knew that the first time
I laid my eyes on you.
"Pack up your desk".
Excuse me.
- Hello?
- What's the date?
This is harassment.
September 4th, 1979.
I can prove it.
You know that big kitchen pantry?
I'll draw something.
Um...
On the wall, just inside the door on the right-hand side.
And then if it's still there, you'll know I'm right.
Will you do that?
Will you look?
Sure, Rose.
I'll look.
- Hello?
- Was it there?
It was, wasn't it?
A picture. A rose.
I knew it.
- I wanna know what's going on.
- What do you mean?
You knew the picture was there.
Maybe someone told you about it.
- I don't know. I want the truth.
- I drew it.
I did it last night like I said I would, and it's still there.
I don't believe you.
But I'm supposed to believe you?
You tell me you're from the future and I believe you. I don't call you crazy.
I give you proof and you call me a liar.
I'm not calling you a liar.
This is happening for a reason.
I gotta go.
Not yet, please.
There's things I need to ask you.
Carter loses.
Reagan becomes president.
Morning.
Morning.
They're beautiful.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, man.
Did you know the people before me in the apartment?
A Spanish couple.
Mr. and Mrs. Alvarez.
Nice people.
You know Mrs. Alvarez, she would cook this caldo gallego from time to time.
To die for. Yeah.
Why did they leave?
I don't know.
I got up one day, they were gone.
Guess some family stuff or something. Not sure.
I don't know.
And the people before them?
Before?
I could hardly remember what
I had for breakfast.
I don't know.
Don't hang up, please.
Please?
Mary? Are you there?
I just need someone to talk to.
I get so lonely. Please.
You're so busy, you can't spare five minutes?
I'm here.
Thank you for not hanging up.
This is a little weird.
Well, people come together for a reason, Mary.
It doesn't matter how.
Do you believe that?
I don't know. I suppose.
- Why are you sad?
- I have to go now.
Is it a man?
- Did he cheat on you?
- No.
Oh, don't be sad, Mary.
You sound like a smart lady.
You'll find someone better, someone who deserves you.
Bobby cheats on me all the time.
Why don't you leave him?
I love him.
So find a good substitute.
Chocolate's good.
He keeps promising he'll change.
You've heard of feminism, yeah?
Women's lib?
Yeah, of course.
Jump on the bandwagon. It's a goer.
Bobby doesn't like women's lib.
He says they need a good smack.
MARY: He ever do that to you?
Not really.
Not really?
He says he loves me.
They don't change, Rose.
Ever.
Sometimes I think
I should have just got rid of him.
Sometimes I think walking out was the worst mistake I ever made.
I took your advice.
What?
He... he laughed at me.
I told him about you and me and how he had to change and he just kept on laughing.
I got rid of him, Mary, just like you told me to.
I worked all night.
Real quiet so the neighbors wouldn't hear.
They'll never find him.
They'll think he ran away with one of his tramps.
You killed him.
I can move into the apartment now.
They don't care who pays the rent.
I always hoped I'd live there with Bobby someday, but...
Mary, are you there?
Don't ever call me, understand?
I just did what you told me to do.
Don't ever call me again.
Marie?
Oh, God.
How big is he?
Bigger than you.
Yeah, but I'm wiry.
Be careful.
Come here.
Why?
Come here.
That's not what I saw.
How did you end up down here?
Navy brat. My dad was stationed at Roosey Roads.
- It's just closed, right?
- Mm-hm.
You?
My grandparents came over from Turin.
I was born here, but I went to school in Florida. Gainesville.
Taught there for a while.
And then I saw the opening at the college.
Don't get many Italians in San Juan.
By the time my grandfather realized this wasn't New York, the boat had already sailed.
That's not true.
Ma, that true about Pappy?
Idiot got on the wrong boat.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Guidi.
I like this one.
Does he, uh, bring girls around often?
One time before.
Ma.
She asked, I'm gonna tell.
A girl called Trulli.
Trudy, Trudy.
That girl could eat like a horse.
Ma.
Giovanni, that girl Johnny brought home, what did she eat?
Let's see.
Caesar salad, roast beef, french fries, carrots, minced peas, three pieces of bread and butter and a tiramisu.
What happened to Trudy?
She exploded.
Would you like something else?
No, thank you.
We should be...
We should be going.
Mm-mm.
Hey, see you, Pop.
Nice meeting you, Mary.
Good night.
Bye-bye.
It's not where
I pictured you.
I needed a place in a hurry.
It's not so bad.
The apartments are really big.
Thanks for tonight.
You're welcome.
Good night.
Good night.
Whose jacket?
How did you get in here?
How many times I told you?
Can't go leaving the back door open.
Lucky it was me.
Could've been anyone.
I'm calling the police.
Go ahead.
If you wanna make me angry.
Neither one of us wants that.
All these lawyers.
We haven't had a chance to talk.
You can't be here.
Not within 500 feet of me.
Five hundred feet.
Come on.
It's kinda ridiculous, isn't it?
What do you want?
I miss you, Mary.
I mean, the way we were, the fun we used to have.
Remember? So I just said,
"Screw the judges. Screw the lawyers.
They don't know us".
I just came to talk.
The way we used to.
Remember?
Don't answer it.
Mary.
I forgot my jacket.
I didn't mean to intrude.
Excuse my manners.
- John Guidi.
- Hey, Steven. Nice to meet you.
Um, excuse me.
You wanna tell your friend you're busy?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you busy?
Not really.
Not really.
I'll be in touch.
You need to get the air conditioning fixed.
Tell that to my building manager.
I could take a look at it some time if you want.
Thanks.
You should call the police. I mean you do have a restraining order on the guy.
It wouldn't make a difference.
Only makes him mad.
Mary, listen, I can...
I can handle it.
Thanks.
I'll check that lock.
That should do it.
Gonna be okay?
I'll be fine.
All right.
In case you need anything.
Thanks. Again.
Hello?
- Hi. Is that Luillo?
- Yes.
It's Mary Kee.
I'm calling from apart...
- Hello?
- I'm here.
I'm calling about the air conditioning.
I can't hear you. Hel...?
Hello?
- Hello.
- Luillo?
- Yes?
- Hi, it's Mary.
You're calling about...
The air conditioning.
- What's wrong?
- It's been broken since I moved in.
It's something I can fix in...
That long?
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll be calling.
I'll wait for your call. Thank you.
Bye.
I told you to stop calling me.
What happened?
Are you okay?
Hi, Mom.
No, it's not Steven. It's just a crank.
No trouble?
No, she's sweet, a really nice girl.
She's a little bit down today.
Hey.
Your buddy John?
Great job fixing my lawn mower.
It's just a couple wires.
I'll tell you, he handled that engine like a nervous lover.
It was really just...
A feather touch.
Hey, can I offer you guys a soda?
Um, I gotta go.
So soon?
It was...
I really just came by to make sure that you were okay.
- Everything's fine.
- Bye.
- Bye, George.
- Okay.
I will call you.
We should do something.
Okay.
Feather touch.
You're a wicked man, George.
That I am.
Hello?
I know you've been avoiding me.
But that's going to stop now.
I told you...
I saw you and your mommy today posing for photos outside the cathedral.
When I call, you're going to answer.
I wanna keep you safe, Mary, you and your beautiful mother.
Shit.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Who won the World Series in '79?
Pirates beat the Baltimore Orioles.
Pirates were down a three-game-to-one deficit.
They won it in seven games, yeah.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, look it up.
Clemente would've been proud of that.
And that same year, the year the Pirates beat the Orioles, who lived in my apartment?
What is this about?
You said you can't remember what you had for breakfast.
I think you remember just fine.
Rose. Rose Lazar.
You knew her.
She said, "Good morning".
You know, things like that, yeah.
And?
You know, she was the sad type.
She had a boyfriend who worked over at the Army base.
They were together for a while.
From time to time, they'd be fighting.
Come home around midnight, they'd be hollering and banging doors.
One day, the guy just disappeared.
That's when she moved in.
What happened to her?
Killed herself.
Here?
She wrapped the phone cord around her neck, hung herself from the ceiling.
Do you know why she did it?
Like I said, she... she was the sad type.
Are you sure she's dead?
That's what I was told, but there's no death certificate.
Sorry, I can't help you.
It's Steven. It has to be.
How? How would he build a wall without my noticing? A wall.
And how would he know about Rose?
He set it up.
He must have done it.
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.
You're talking to a Trekkie.
I can handle it.
All right.
Let's say that you're right.
You talked to this woman a few weeks ago and then she put something in your pantry.
- A body.
- A body.
But according to your time-jump theory, she doesn't do it a few weeks ago, she does it in 1979.
When you moved in, the pantry would already be bricked up.
- But it wasn't.
- Exactly, so it doesn't work.
Unless you're remembering the past as it was before it changed.
This is time like a river.
And this is something that happens.
An event.
Which affects the way the river flows.
Right.
So if you follow this path, he ends up leaving and she hangs herself.
What if something interferes with that?
She makes a new friend, say.
- Hello.
- Is Bobby there?
We get a whole different path.
The boyfriend ends up dead and you lose your pantry.
Right, but why...?
- why did you remember the pantry?
- Right.
You remember it because you caused it to change.
And somehow it leaves a trace, like a pencil drawing a line, so...
You erase it... and you draw another line.
But you can still see where the first one was.
But only you.
Only the person that erased it.
- You really think that's it?
- Honestly, no.
I think we pull down that wall, there's some sick surprise from Steven and he's fucking with you.
I'm not touching that wall.
What? You're just gonna leave it there?
Really? Come on, really?
You're gonna go to bed wondering if there is a corpse in your kitchen?
I'm not touching it.
Can we get the bear?
No, I don't want the hat.
I still can't believe you lost my hat.
I loved that hat.
Stay there.
John, is that you?
Hey, buddy.
Hello?
Who's there?
Which fictional family lives at 742 Evergreen Terrace?
Repeat the question, please.
742 Evergreen Terrace.
Which fictional family lives at that address?
Simpsons.
I'm gonna pass.
You were right to pass.
The correct answer is the Simpsons.
Question six.
Worcestershire sauce contains two of the following ingredients.
Which ingredient does it not contain?
Molasses, anchovies, mustard.
- Mustard.
- Mustard?
Is the correct answer.
ROSE:
Did I wake you?
You're not gonna hang up on me now, are you?
Oh, come on.
You're not gonna talk to me?
We're friends, aren't we?
Don't want anything to happen to that charming mother of yours.
You out late last night?
What's his name?
John.
John what?
John Guidi.
Guidi.
Sure, his parents run the little diner on San Francisco.
I saw you yesterday.
What?
In a nursing home.
I don't understand.
I found you through social services.
Is something wrong with me?
Am I sick?
Not physically.
A little thin, maybe.
You don't eat.
Mentally, though...
Tell me.
What do you think?
All that anger, all that rage.
You didn't think it would affect you?
You're lying.
Think about it, Rose.
Ever wonder why you don't have any friends?
Why you're stalking someone you never even met?
You think that's normal?
Shut up.
What about Bobby, all the times he screwed around on you?
All the times he walked out on you?
He never walked out on me.
Who told you that?
It doesn't matter.
Who have you been talking to?
Who's been telling tales?
It's not important.
What's important is that you can change this.
You don't have to end up in a nuthouse.
You can stop this happening.
You spoke to me?
You don't talk much.
I stayed a little while, watched some TV, played cards.
Said I'd come visit again today.
I don't play cards, never have.
Well, I guess you learned.
Not well, either.
I beat you every time.
You think this is funny.
You think this is fucking funny?
A sad, pathetic woman in diapers who can't feed herself?
No, Rose, I don't think it's funny.
But it doesn't have to be this way.
It's your choice.
All right.
That should do it.
That is so good.
Do you know why they call them daisies?
No.
It's from "day's eye".
Because they open their petals in the sun.
You know what I call them?
Weeds.
No, you don't.
Sure, I do.
No, you like them.
You think they're pretty.
Is that so?
There you go.
Did you visit me again today?
You said you would.
Just got back.
We play cards?
A little.
How did I look?
A little better.
More color, maybe.
That all? Nothing else about me?
Nothing unusual?
I'm really not sure.
Think real hard.
I'm really not sure.
Okay, Mary.
I'm going to bury something next to the palm tree a couple of feet out towards the apartment.
You go dig it up. You understand?
Dig it up.
ROSE:
You lied.
You didn't find me in a nursing home, did you, Mary?
You didn't find me at all.
Because if you had, you'd have known what to say:
"Yes, Rose, you did look different.
You looked a whole lot different".
It's not real. It can't be real.
That is fucked.
Great.
Let me.
No.
Trust me.
Hello?
ROSE:
Who's this?
Name's John. Who's this?
John Guidi, Mary's little friend.
I know your parents, John Guidi.
That's nice.
Put her on.
I think me and you should talk first.
I said, put her on.
She doesn't wanna speak to you right now.
Did she find my gift?
Yeah.
I gotta say, I think that's pretty screwed-up, don't you?
I've got another little surprise.
Tell her I guessed who the tattletale was.
What?
Tattletale tit
Your tongue shall be split
And every little puppy dog
Shall eat a little bit
You know, Rose, I don't think you should call here anymore.
This whole thing has gone too far.
Just tell hen
Well, that's one seriously nutty lady.
What did she say?
Something about a tattletale.
Said she guessed who it was.
What?
George. George.
Where's George?
Excuse me?
This is his apartment.
No.
I just saw him this evening.
I made him a daisy chain.
I hope you don't mind me asking, how long have you been here?
A few months, since the baby.
And before that?
Do you know who was here before?
Older couple,
Dominican, I think.
Sorry to have disturbed you.
Thank you.
You remember George.
George. You met him.
You made jokes.
You fixed his lawn mower, for chrissakes.
I never met him, Mary.
You think I'm crazy.
I think we should go inside.
Maybe it would be a good idea for you not to be here tonight.
I'm not crazy.
You've been under a lot of pressure with Steven and the phone.
Maybe you could go to your mom's.
You could stay at mine.
This isn't...
It wouldn't...
I'd stay on the couch and you could get some sleep.
And see how you feel in the morning.
- Through here.
- Thanks.
Hey, it's okay, Dex.
Keep going.
Maybe you should move out.
- I've only just moved in.
- This woman is crazy.
Whoever she is, wherever she's calling from, if you move out, maybe it'll stop.
Maybe that's what she wants.
So now you don't think it's Steven?
I don't know who it is, but if it were me,
I would be out of there.
I should go to bed.
Leave this.
There are fresh towels on the bed.
Thanks.
Mary!
What's wrong?
What?
Nothing.
Nothing, I'm fine. Go back to sleep.
Morning.
Hey. Hey, Dex.
Coffee?
Yeah, that sounds great.
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Um...
I think I'm gonna take Dexter for a walk.
And then?
And then I'm gonna go back to the apartment, pick up my things and make the dreaded call to Mom.
I think that's right.
Hey, Dex. Hey.
You wanna go for a run? Yeah?
Go on.
Let him go, Steven.
Come on, Dex.
Come on, Dexter.
Come on, Dex. Come on.
So are you sleeping with him now?
That new friend of yours?
Dexter. Come to Mommy, Dexter.
That's a good boy. Come on.
I don't think it's really fair.
He gets to share my dog.
Come on, Dex.
We're leaving.
He doesn't get to share my dog.
You understand?
Hm?
- Hello?
- Hey, I'm finishing at 3.
And you wanna meet up after class?
Yeah.
Meet you out front.
Sounds great.
All right. Okay, bye.
Bye.
The number you have dialed is not in service.
- I'm looking for John.
- Ah, I'll call him.
I'm sorry, Mr. Guidi.
I'm actually looking for John Jr.
I tried his cell-phone, it doesn't seem to be working.
- John Jr.?
- I was supposed to meet him.
I only wanna talk to him.
You wanna talk to my son?
- I don't understand.
- I'll tell you.
Santa Margarita, south entrance.
That's where I go when I want to talk to him.
WOMAN:
You knew him?
I see his mother from time to time.
She comes here a lot.
My husband, Charlie, prick that he was.
You know anything about the boy?
How he died?
They don't know he died.
They were never sure.
They never found him.
Bobby Shafto went to sea
Silver buckles...
You were supposed to kill yourself.
George found you here in the kitchen.
You'd started to smell.
This was your fault, Mary. All of it.
He was gonna take you away from me.
You were gonna let him.
I'm willing to forgive, start over.
You'll never be happy, Rose.
We both know that.
So why put up with it?
A few pills, that's all it would take.
But I am happy.
I have a friend here with me.
GIRL:
Hello?
Who's this?
GIRL:
Mary. Mary Kee.
You're lying.
GIRL: No, I'm not.
Where do you live?
GIRL:
Roosey Roads.
Rose says you're one of her best friends.
Says I'm one of her best friends too.
Mary, listen.
You need to go home now.
Understand?
ROSE:
Hello, Mary. Recognize the voice?
You should. It's yours.
What are you doing with her, you crazy bitch?
We're making dinner, Mary.
Surely you remember.
We're frying chicken.
But we have to be careful, don't we, because oil is hot.
Oil gets very hot.
We have to be very, very careful, don't we, Mary?
Yes, please be careful.
What was that?
Please be careful.
You were mean to me, Mary.
You were gonna let that man take you away from me.
I'm sorry, Rose.
You don't sound sorry.
I really am.
You sound scared, but you don't sound sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
One more time.
One more time and we'll see if you sound like you mean it.
I'm really sorry, Rose.
I don't think so.
Please. Please, Rose. Please.
No! Stop it, please!
Please, stop, Rose, please!
Stop! Stop!
No!
- Rose?
- Yes, Mary.
- Are you still mad at me?
- No.
You?
I was.
You see why I did it now, don't you?
All I ever wanted was to be your friend.
Don't ever leave me, Mary.
- It's my birthday tomorrow.
- Congratulations.
- What have you got planned?
- Nothing.
I remember it back then.
It was horrible.
Yeah?
I had a party at the bowling alley on the base.
Nobody came.
They were scared of how I looked.
I was so sad and lonely.
Maybe you could come, Rose.
I'd like that.
It would be just like we were friends.
I'd look after you.
I know that now.
We got there around 3:00.
Maybe a bit after.
I'll be there at 3.
I'll hold a lane for you.
Thank you, Rose.
What are friends for?
Hello?
WOMAN: Oh, hi, honey.
Hi, Mom.
Yeah, I'll be there soon.
How's Dexter?
Good, okay.
Love you.
Yeah, love you. Bye.
Mom, I told you...
ROSE: Hello, Mary.
I missed the bus.
I didn't make it to the bowling alley.
Lucky in a way, though, wasn't it?
- Rose, I didn't...
- Hello?
Hello?
Mary, I need you to go home, okay?
Can you do that? As quick as you can.
Just put the phone down, run as fast as you can.
ROSE:
Not such a bad kid, is she?
What happened, Mary? What made her turn into such a bitch?
Don't hurt her, Rose.
- Please, don't hurt her.
Like you tried to hurt me?
- Like you tried to kill me?
- Rose, I...
Only she wouldn't understand, would she?
She wouldn't think it was fair.
You'd understand, though, wouldn't you, Mary?
Please.
Please.
Rose?
I best let you go now.
You have things to do.
No, I... I have time.
Not today, Mary.
You have a visitor.
Leave me alone!
YOUNG MARY:
Hello? Hello?
Mary?
Mary, you have to run, understand?
I don't know what I did to make her mad.
Is she beside you?
She went to get her pills.
Listen to me. This woman, she's crazy.
It's not your fault. It's nothing you did.
But she's gonna try to hurt you again.
- I'm scared.
- I know, baby.
But you gotta get outta there, okay?
So you have to run. Go, go now!
- But she locked the door.
- Pull! Pull it harder!
She locked them!
She locked them both!
Mary, you have to run!
I waited, Mary.
I waited all this time.
I wanted you to know why you're going to die.
You shouldn't have tried to kill me.
Mary, are you there?
Hello?
Okay, I want you to grab a knife,
Mary, from the kitchen.
Okay? Grab a really big knife.
Tell me when you have it.
Do you have it?
I can't, she's coming.
You never should have lied to me, Mary.
Mary, the wardrobe.
Do you see the wardrobe?
- See the wardrobe in the bedroom?
- I see it.
I want you to smash the mirror, okay?
I want you to kick it as hard as you can.
She's coming!
Just do it!
Mary? Grab one of the pieces, Mary.
- Grab one of the pieces.
- She's in the room!
- You know what you have to do.
- I can't!
Stick it in her, Mary, as hard as you can!
- Please, don't make me.
- Do it, Mary!
- Do it now!
- Go away! Leave me alone!
Her eyes are open.
And she's lying on the floor.
Her eyes are open.
Go home, Mary.
Go home.
- Hey, sweetheart.
- What do you want?
"Hi, honey.
Tough day at work?"
No, sweetheart, it's fine.
It's all fine.
Oh, hello there. Hello.
- Get outta my house.
- Is there any beer?
I said, get out.
All right, if you put it that way.
See what you made me do?
How about that beer?
Please, don't make me.
Last chance, Steven.
Yeah?
Or what?
Bobby, Bobby Shafto
He'll come back and marry me
Pretty Bobby Shafto
Bobby Shafto's tall and fair
As soon as you feed, Senator, you won't need these anymore.
Holy shit!
It's the attack of Grandpa Munster!
Gross.
Damn it.
Sorry to ruin your party, Senator.
Don't worry, we'll have you out of here in two minutes.
- Thank you.
- Edgar! Aah!
Alan? Alan!
Alan!
Alan.
Alan. Alan, are you okay?
No. No, Alan, no. No, Alan!
Alan!
I am a vampire.
Oh, yeah?
Well, abracadabra. I'm an umpire.
Hocus pocus.
Mr. Frog?
Yeah?
Were you sleeping?
I work nights.
- Apparently not hard enough.
- Hmm.
You're in default on your loans...
...and the bank is repossessing this property.
This would include any...
...structure currently on the property as well.
- Are you serious?
- You have one week to vacate.
Have a good day.
Fucking vampires.
Cash or store credit?
Cash.
Comes to 65 even.
Sixty-five dollars?
Are you kidding me? I mean, this issue of Destroy All Vampires number 125...
...in nearly mint condition is worth 50 bucks alone.
In near-mint condition.
I know near-mint condition and that ain't it.
What are you talking about?
I haven't even opened this book.
It's been boarded and bagged since the day I got it.
Well, let's have a look.
There are stress marks at the staple points.
The, uh, cover has lost at least 15 percent of its gloss...
...the pages are yellow...
...and there's significant rubbing and fading at the corners.
Hmm.
Now, if you were willing to part with that Batman number 14...
...I, uh, might be able to do a little bit better.
That's not gonna happen.
Happens to have some sentimental value to it.
That's my offer, Frog.
Take it or leave it.
All right, pay me.
Have a nice day.
I hate happy people.
- Hmm.
- Hey, Edgar.
Did you make any money off of Frank?
Are you kidding?
He gave me 65 bucks for everything.
Ugh. He's such a cheapskate.
Here, let me see.
Uh, not that one.
But there's still some good stuff in here.
You want me to put it up on eBay, see what I can get?
Uh, sure, why not.
Every little bit helps right now.
Where do I find the graphic novels?
You mean comic books.
No, I mean graphic novels.
I don't read comic books. I'm not a geek.
Hmm.
- Oh, well, I can't help you then.
Here at the Book O'Neer, geek is chic.
- Try Barnes & Noble.
Whatever.
I guess you don't want me to spend any money here.
That guy gets on my last nerve.
- You know him?
- By reputation only.
His name is Jonny Trash.
He's a celebrity blogger.
What the hell is he doing here in San Cazador?
- They're here for the X-Party.
- The X-Party?
- What's that?
- A rave.
And it's gonna be here?
If you believe the rumors.
But they're not telling anyone where it's gonna be until the night of the event.
Great.
Sounds like the final nail in my coffin.
What...?
Bye.
Oh, shit!
Who the hell parked...?
My truck.
You sure don't look like a cold-blooded, meaner-than-hell, badass vampire killer.
Excuse me?
You're Edgar Frog.
Sworn enemy to nightcrawlers and bloodsuckers the world over.
I'm sorry, lady.
You must have me confused with somebody else.
I'm Gwen. Gwen Lieber.
- Hi.
- And there is no confusion.
You are the same Edgar Frog that destroyed covens...
...in Santa Carla, Luna Bay and in Washington, D.C.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Can we go inside to talk?
You got two minutes.
It's my brother, Peter.
He's been kidnapped.
A couple of years ago, he started getting into trouble.
He was hanging out with all the wrong kind of people.
Hmm.
And three weeks ago, he went to Ibiza to this rave party thing...
...and he disappeared.
He started following around this guy, DJ X.
He throws these events called X-Parties.
Yeah, I've heard of him.
Hi.
The same people that are throwing this party...
...are throwing similar parties all over the world.
And at these raves, they're handing out this new designer drug.
It's called the Thirst.
- It comes in little ampoules like this one.
Why would I care about...
...a bunch of drug addicts with glow sticks?
Because the Thirst is not a drug.
It's vampire blood.
Nobody has seen him since.
Edgar, they are using these raves to breed an army of vampires.
They're creating their own global pandemic.
They've already infected hundreds in Spain.
Done the same in Thailand, Rio and in Greece.
And now the rumors say that they're on their way here.
I'm not interested.
Look, I would obviously pay you for your trouble.
And this could well be the last time that you would have to do something like this.
All of my research suggests...
...that the Thirst is made from the blood of the head vampire.
- The head vampire.
- The bloodsucking alpha.
- The alpha.
- From the Greek, "root"...
...meaning the first.
The original.
I knew that.
I'm still not interested.
And your two minutes are up.
I'm staying at the Hotel Cazador.
I truly hope that you'll reconsider.
I know you couldn't save your brother...
...but, Edgar, maybe you can help me save mine.
Hmph.
Go and check on our guest, would you?
Hi, handsome.
How are you feeling?
Hmm. Poor little thing.
Just try to relax.
This will all be over soon.
Why would anyone jump out of a perfectly good airplane?
Because it's so fucking fun!
You make sure our package arrives in one piece.
And send someone to take care of Frog.
DJ X...
...the man behind the machine. I've been whoring the fuck out of your next party...
...on my website, and you can't even text me back?
You know how many media impressions that is a day?
Don't put your hands on me, man.
I don't even know you.
That's our head of security, Kirk O'Dale.
There...
...now you know him.
Well, just wait a minute.
If you don't give an interview right now...
...then I swear I'll make it my personal mission in life...
...to make sure that no one goes to any more of your stupid parties ever.
Well, we wouldn't want that.
After all...
...ever is a long time.
Step into my office.
I've got the blues
I've got the blues
I ain't got nothing but the blues
I ain't got nothing but the blues
Why did you go?
Ugh. Creepy.
Why did you go
And leave me here with the blues?
And leave me here with the blues?
You left me sad and you left me sore
You left me with the lowdown blues
Hello, Edgar.
What brings you all the way down here?
Now I have to have an excuse to visit my own brother?
At 1 in the morning, yeah.
I figured you'd be up.
I've recently learned there's a nightcrawler...
...who's created a new designer drug that he's handing out to kids at raves.
The only problem is it's not a drug...
...it's vampire blood.
He's breeding an undead army...
...and the only thing that stands between him...
...and the annihilation...
...of the entire human race...
...potentially...
...would be us.
The Frog Brothers.
We haven't been the Frog Brothers for a long time.
I just...
- I can't do it without you.
- What about Sam?
Sam's gone.
He turned, and, uh, I had to do what I had to do.
I guess that cancels out
Michael and Star.
Yeah. I'm pretty much persona non grata with the entire Emerson family at this point.
- Laddie?
- He's moved on.
He's got a wife, kids.
He's got a real life now.
- Yeah, well, so do I.
- You call this a life?
- This from a guy who lives in a trailer.
- Okay, so I've got nothing.
But at least I know what side I'm on!
Alan, if this is the head vampire, then maybe we can kill him.
If we kill him, then we just gotta find the one above him...
...and then on and on like that forever.
- They are telling me that this is the alpha.
The O.G. Of all bloodsuckers, the head vampire.
It's a pyramid scheme, Edgar.
Always has been.
What if this is it though?
What if this really is the head vampire?
Get this...
...and get it good, Edgar.
As far as I'm concerned...
...there's no such thing as vampires.
Hola, Trashynistas.
I'm sitting here with the one, the only...
...DJ X.
I'm sorry for those of you who have a shitty connection.
I guess you'll just have to take my word for when I tell you...
...the man's absolutely scrumptious.
They'll just have to come and see me in person.
Yeah, well, they'll just have to get in line. Ha, ha.
So, DJ X, why do you think the detached and the...
...you know, the disconnected youth of today have latched on so fervently...
...to your parties?
Because I create a place...
...where all the lost souls of the world can come together.
A place where they can do what they want...
...whenever they wanna do it.
Yeah, you heard it straight from the man himself...
...all you lost boys and girls. This is gonna be the biggest rave of the century.
And we'll let you know where it's gonna be an hour before this event...
...so stay tuned to this website for the deets.
That was a great interview, X.
Thank you so much.
No, no, thank you...
...for getting the word out.
I wanna have as many people at this event as possible.
It's my pleasure.
And I mean that.
So anyhow, what do you guys have to drink in this jalopy?
You.
Death to all vampires.
Maximum body count.
We're awesome monster bashers.
- The meanest.
- The baddest.
Edgar.
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.
Lots of weapons.
Lots of really expensive, custom-made weapons.
Well, of course. Come in.
Hmm.
Please have a seat.
So aren't you the least bit curious on how I know so much about vampires?
Not really.
I know who you are.
You're Gwen Lieber. Bestselling author of the Eternity Kiss series.
First of which is about to be made into a major motion picture...
...coming soon to a theater near you.
Oh, you've heard of me. I'm flattered.
Don't be. Your books suck.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Doesn't really matter what I think.
You've got millions of emo-goth sheep all over the world...
...who eat up every last word of it, and keep coming back for more.
I'm sure you've made quite a nice living off your supernatural bodice-rippers.
I'll have you know, I have gotten glowing reviews from every major periodical.
Bought and paid for, I'm sure.
Just like me.
What is your problem, Frog?
My problem?
My problem is you glorify vampirism.
You make being a vampire look...
...sexy.
Well...
...there has always been an element of eroticism in vampire mythology.
There is nothing sexy about being a member of the undead.
Well, perhaps I have made a serious mistake in coming to you.
If you came to me expecting me to ask for your autograph, then yes, you did.
But if you came to me expecting me to kill a shitload of vampires...
...that I can do.
Don't like the stake...
...maybe it needs a little garlic?
Here we go.
Freshly served.
Shit.
Eat that.
- Frog.
GWEN Edgar, it's Gwen.
Can you come by my hotel right away?
It's rather important.
All right. I'll be right there.
Hello, Edgar.
So, what's so important you need me to come down here right away?
Well, I thought you should meet your new partner.
When you turned me down,
I was desperate, so I hired someone else...
...and I'd really feel bad making him come all the way from Hollywood for nothing.
Hollywood?
I don't like the sound of it. Who is this?
Lars Von Goetz?
Lars, this is...
Oh, yeah. The Toad.
Frog.
- Edgar Frog.
- That's what I said.
Yeah.
I'm Lars Von Goetz.
But you already knew that.
And this is Claus, my camera operator.
So let's go kick the shit out of some little rave punks, huh?
But first, I gotta eat.
I got the metabolism of a 12-year-old boy.
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Right.
Never fear, Lars Von Goetz is here.
As long as the check clears.
Lars Von Goetz?
You hired Lars Von Goetz?
- I thought you'd be happy.
- Happy?
First you expect me to kill a head vampire...
...then you expect me to babysit some reality show reject?
You're not going to have to babysit him.
Haven't you seen his show?
The man's wrestled a grizzly bear, a lion and an alligator.
He's amazing.
That was staged.
All reality shows are staged, okay?
Von Goetz, whatever his name is, he's a fraud.
Vampires are, like,
10 times stronger than grizzly bears.
- Well, I think he can take care of himself.
- We'll see about that.
That creepy guy's looking at me.
Oh, gross.
Here's the deal.
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.
Right. You said that.
I'll go see my guy tomorrow.
- You don't want me to come with you?
- No.
He's a little twitchy about new faces.
Listen, buddy, if you're looking for the diet frozen-yogurt bar...
...it went out of business last summer.
Actually,
I'm looking for a Batman number 14.
That's a very serious book, man.
Only five in existence.
Four, actually.
I'm always looking out for the other three.
Edgar, since I know...
...I'll never be able to talk you out of what you're about to do...
...I can't let you go up against a potential head vampire without giving you this.
One of the first books on vampire hunting ever written.
It'll hopefully keep you safe.
Watch your back. Alan.
P.S. If you're still alive on Tuesday, be sure to call Mom.
It's her birthday.
ZOE Book O'Neer.
- Hey, Zoe.
I need your help with something.
- It's important.
Sure.
I'll be waiting.
Wow, so the Gwen Lieber hired you to find her kidnapped brother?
Yeah, and I think this book might help me figure out...
...where they've taken him to.
I need you to scour it for any clues, anything you can find.
I don't see how this old book is gonna help you find anyone, but I'll give it a try.
Do me a favor.
If you happen to run across anything in here...
...that talks about human sacrifice or anything like that, make note of it.
All right.
Cool.
Uh, do you wanna tell me why?
Not really.
Could put your life in danger.
Okay.
Oh, my gosh.
Where's Frog?
Back off, fucko!
Or what? You gonna mace me?
Somebody needed a light?
Frog.
Ugly.
You're dead.
Suck on this.
Watch out!
Nice.
Mace?
Holy water.
I feel like pancakes.
Order up.
I found a whole section of young male vampire sacrifices.
And look, there's a Blood Moon.
They call it that because the moon's face is deep red or crimson hue.
So they're gonna make a sacrifice under the Blood Moon.
Exactly.
This Friday is a Blood Moon.
So they're gonna sacrifice Peter at the rave.
- Well, Edgar, you can't let that happen.
- All right, if I'm gonna do this...
...I need to find out where the rave is and I need to find out fast.
Well, technically, raves are illegal...
...so the promoters aren't gonna say where it is until the last minute.
You said that the rumor is that it was gonna be here in San Cazador.
Even if it is here,
San Cazador is a big place.
If we're gonna find out where that nest is...
...we need to learn how to think like a vampire.
Bloodsuckers have a tendency to look for a place...
...that's got a history of suffering and death.
You know of a place like that here?
There's an old slaughterhouse on San Cazador Island.
Slaughterhouse?
Perfect.
Nothing vampires love more than blood and carnage.
If there's a slaughterhouse on that island, that's where they'll be.
Let me go.
- I promise, l...
- Uh-uh-uh.
Let's not make any promises we can't keep.
You just lie here like a good piece of veal...
...and maybe I'll bring you a nice glass of warm milk.
Hmm.
So where are we going?
My friend likes his privacy.
The name's Blake.
Used to be a congressman before he learned the truth.
What's up with all the razor wire?
Yo, Blake. Open up.
It's Edgar.
Whew. Edgar.
- How's it hanging?
- What's up, Blake?
Holy-water grenade.
- Nice touch.
- Yeah.
- Needs a little work, though.
- Yeah.
Who the hell's this?
Oh, this is Zoe.
She's cool.
Yeah, I'll be the judge of that.
Touch the cross. Do it now.
Zoe, manners.
- Nice to meet you.
- Blake.
What's with the bike?
Oh, that's a beauty.
I've been working on her for a full year.
Renovations, the lot.
She's gonna be a real killer.
Yeah. Unfortunately, wouldn't do us much good on this mission.
What else you got?
Welcome to the lair.
What happened to this thing?
Looks like something blew up in the barrel.
You should see the vampire
I was pointing it at.
Let's just say the gun came out on the winning side.
Nice new stuff, Blake.
I like it.
You looking for something to replace your Old Reliable?
Never.
Ah, you say that now.
Feast your eyes on this.
An old Russki RG-6 grenade launcher.
Whoa.
Heavy.
Fires 40 mm fragmentation grenades.
Not this one.
This one fires these.
What is it? Holy water?
Mixed with a little garlic.
Just for giggles.
- I'll take it.
- I thought you might.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
What's this?
Hey, put that down, please.
Very carefully, okay?
That is a prototype resin grenade.
I stole it from a military testing facility at Groom Lake.
What does it do?
- Oh, shit.
Cool.
Yeah, cool.
I will take that other resin grenade, though.
Gotta hand it to the grays...
...they sure are good at making weapons.
Well, it's a pleasure doing business with you, Edgar, as always.
Mm.
Say, you guys wanna stay for dinner?
I got beans.
Yeah, you do.
What the hell are these?
Those?
- Those are, uh...
- A reminder.
Vampires.
They must have tracked us here.
What did you do to them?
- High-powered UV lamps.
Edgar, all the weapons are in the car.
I guess we're gonna have to improvise.
They've taken out the UV lights.
Hi, sweetheart, aren't you gonna invite me in?
No. You're not invited.
Wait. Where are you going?
Holy shit, we gotta get out of here.
They'll kill us if we go outside.
I'd rather be bit than burned.
Come on, let's go!
- Hi there.
- Guys, get down!
Say hello to Old Painless.
Now, that's what I call a stakeout.
It's cool, right?
Yeah, it should be. It's my design.
If all of these freaks go to the island and take the Thirst at the rave...
...we're gonna have a full-on vampire invasion on our hands.
Okay, man, you got the glow sticks?
Let's roll.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yes.
Hey. You didn't tell me...
...Lars Von Goetz was gonna be here.
Yeah.
- I was kind of hoping he wasn't.
Oh, yeah.
That guy is a total animal.
Yes, baby.
You see the episode where he wrestled the grizzly bear?
- Missed it.
Oh, yeah.
Toad.
Hmm.
So, hmm, who's your friend?
Hi. I'm Zoe.
Zoe.
Tell me, Zoe, is it just me...
...or is there some serious chemistry between us?
That's just you.
Okay.
Edgar.
I hope you brought your bathing suit.
I thought we should blend in with the other partygoers.
Covert infiltration.
It's a good idea.
Hi, I'm Gwen.
Yeah, I know.
I've sold, like, a bazillion of your books.
- I'm Zoe.
- Right.
You work in a bookstore?
Part-time.
And Edgar thinks that you're qualified for this mission?
Just how many bloodsuckers have you killed, Miss Lieber?
- None.
- More qualified than you.
Well, this is Edgar's show, and I trust him.
Did I mention I hated her books?
So do I.
Rave!
All right, everybody.
According to the blueprints...
...there's an entrance to the slaughterhouse through a series of underground tunnels...
...which will lead us directly to where the rave is.
Now, remember, everyone, there will be a lot of civilians around.
Toadies, not familiars.
Just innocent partygoers who are all there because they think they're gonna have...
...fun.
Because of this, you will be armed...
...with weapons that are non-lethal to anything with a heartbeat.
This is a sawed-off, pump action,
Soak and Destroy water gun.
Patent pending.
Turns holy water...
...into holy slaughter.
Zoe, you take it.
Claus...
...it's a high-powered UV torch.
Tie it around your waist.
You'll thank me later.
Edgar, what about me?
You're staying here.
The hell I am!
This is my brother we are talking about.
I understand that...
...but this is not one of your books,
Gwen.
Everybody on this mission is a trained veteran.
You could be killed, or worse...
...you could be turned into one of them.
Okay, time out.
Listen, Gwen, I totally buy into your little vampire goth games...
...that's what you're paying me to do, but I'm calling bullshit.
If Gwen wants to go, she can go.
Not as long as I'm in charge of this mission.
It's all right, Lars.
Listen to him.
Edgar knows what he's talking about.
He's an experienced vampire hunter.
Wrong. I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you...
...but there are no experienced vampire hunters...
...because there are no vampires.
They do not exist.
Hmm.
Zoe, take these stakes, strap them to your leg.
And why does she get stakes?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were Mr. Tough Guy...
...who wrestled a 6-foot alligator with your bare hands. You don't need weapons.
No, it was 10-foot.
- And I still want stakes.
- Fine.
There's some stakes.
Why are hers metal?
You get what you get.
Let's go.
Edgar, wait.
Bring him back safe.
I'll do my best.
Move out.
Hey, Toad.
Couldn't we come back at night?
It would look so much better on camera.
No. Vampires feed at night...
...and I don't plan on sticking around for dinner.
Is this the VIP room?
Oh, most definitely.
- When's the party supposed to start?
- Not for a while.
You guys got here early.
Oh, are those promise rings?
- So cute.
Is that blood on your face?
Oh! I think I just broke my coccyx.
Forget the coccyx, is the camera okay?
Radio check.
Check.
Check.
Check.
All right. Once inside, our main objective is to extract Peter.
Killing vampires is our second priority.
All right, everybody...
...let's rock 'n' roll.
Heads up.
Hey, did you name your new gun yet?
Shh.
What?
Did you name your new gun yet?
What are you talking about?
All guns need a name.
Like boats.
Boats are for sailors...
...guns are for soldiers.
I'm no sailor.
- Lars.
What?
I'm getting a really bad feeling about this.
Ugh. What, you mean being deep within the earth beneath a thousand tons of rock?
Are you feeling "Claus-trophobic"?
Get it? "Claus-trophobic"?
That's not funny.
I'm serious, man, look around you.
This shit's freaking me out.
Jeepers.
All right, here's the deal.
We're gonna go to the left, you guys go to the right.
Zoe, you're with me.
Lars and Claus, do whatever it is you do.
We'll reconvene back on the beach...
...maybe.
You know,
I kind of hate the fact we split up.
People in horror movies always split up and they always get killed.
There's nothing to worry about, Claus.
Don't you get it?
This is all some stupid role-playing game.
All we're gonna find is some little emo goth kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.
You think this is a game?
Of course I think it's a game. Why else would the Toad give me a water pistol?
Besides, my fans are tired of seeing me tackle every natural predator on the planet.
Now, we need to give them something new to watch.
But if you're right...
...you're gonna be beating up a bunch of kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.
I know.
Isn't it great?
This is the entrance to the slaughterhouse.
Time for Mr. Frog's wild ride.
Ow.
Claus, we gotta find a place to do my intro.
Oh, yeah.
This is perfect.
Okay.
Using my tracking ability, we've located the nest of the vampires...
...deep within this abandoned slaughterhouse.
It's also haunted...
...by cannibal pirates.
It's built on an ancient Indian burial ground...
...where they used to burn witches.
Oh.
A promise ring.
Virgins.
Vampire filet mignon.
Ugh. What kind of fucked up shit is this?
Are you Peter?
Please, help me.
Dude. Turn around, let's go.
- What?
- It's too early to find him.
We gotta find him at the end of the episode.
I haven't even had the chance to put the beat-down on any goths yet.
- But he's right here.
- Dude, turn around.
Sorry, Peter. Let's go.
What the fuck?
Where are you bastards going?
Something smells really bad in here.
It's a slaughterhouse.
I don't mean the typical bad slaughterhouse dead meat smell...
...I mean I smell something...
It smells like rotting garbage.
Trash.
Yeah, like I said. Rotting garbage.
No.
I mean Jonny Trash.
Jeez Louise.
Jeez Louise? Really?
Zoe, get down!
You hear that?
What?
I think it's coming from down there.
What are you doing?
Lars.
Lars.
Dude, where's my gear?
You left it up...
Oh, shit.
What?
Oh, okay.
Is this it?
I've been waiting 300 years for a good fight.
Have you had enough, punk?
Nice outfit.
That's funny...
...that's exactly what I was thinking.
But I still have to kill you.
I'm surprised.
By what?
You're really not that good.
- Aah!
Edgar!
Zoe. I got this.
Ah, shit! Damn bullets!
See, now that's what happens when you don't name your gun.
Just pull out the sword!
- On three.
- Okay.
Three.
What happened to one and two?
Edgar? Edgar? Oh, God.
Lars, what's your 20?
- It's not Lars, it's Claus.
- Claus, where's Lars?
He's dead.
Lars is dead.
We're so completely and totally fucked.
Claus, calm down. Just breathe.
We have to get Edgar out of here before reinforcements arrive.
- Oh, my God. Zoe, what happened?
Just help us lay him down.
Claus, first-aid kit.
Hang in there.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Hold this.
Edgar, stay with me.
Notice anything unusual about Santa Carla yet?
No, it's a pretty cool place...
...if you're a Martian.
Or a vampire.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
You think you know what's happening around here, don't you?
Well, I'll tell you something.
You don't know shit, buddy.
Yeah. You think we just work in a comic-book store for our folks, huh?
Actually, I thought it was a bakery.
This is just our cover.
We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
We're fighters for truth...
...justice...
...and the American way.
Edgar.
- Edgar.
- What?
- What happened to me?
- You're okay.
Did we get him? Did we get Peter?
Claus found him, but they ran into some trouble.
They had him tied to some twisted table kind of thing...
...pumping him full of drugs, trying to keep him sedated.
Where's your boss? Von Geek?
Some big-ass, massive juggernaut of a vampire got him.
Tore his heart right out of his chest.
Got it on tape, though.
I'd like to see that when you get a chance.
- He'd like that.
- Thanks.
Gwen...
...it's gonna be okay.
We'll get him.
It's not over yet.
Payback's a bitch.
Damn straight. Let's go.
Rave! Rave!
It's starting.
All right, come on.
Hey!
Hey, there.
Do you wanna party?
LILY And now, the man you've been waiting for, DJ X!
Are you ready for a sacrifice?
Blood, blood, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
Hold up.
Oh, my God. There he is.
If they get through that fence, we're so undeniably fucked.
The sooner we take out X, the sooner that won't be a problem.
Okay, but what about Peter?
All right, listen up, everyone.
I want you all to hold back.
I've only got one shot at this.
I'm gonna immobilize X and then we go in for the kill.
Everybody, stay put. Got it?
- Got it.
- Good.
Put on something nasty, X.
I think I found someone
I wanna dance with.
He dropped it. I'm going in.
Zoe, wait.
Get in here and help me. Come on.
That is exactly how I'm going to break your neck.
Vinyl still shreds.
Very creative, Frog.
But when it comes to killing...
...I prefer more traditional methods...
...like impalement.
Claus, cover us!
Shit. Shit.
You fought admirably.
But you were doomed to fail from the start.
I've fought beside great warriors...
...learned battle techniques...
...that can only be mastered over several lifetimes.
And do you know what the first rule of combat is?
Yeah, don't monologue.
There's a lot of vampires down here.
Guys, I can't hold them off forever.
Fuck me. Fuck me!
Edgar!
Nice work. I've got it.
You're right. Impalement is good.
Especially when you pierce the heart.
Peter.
All right, everybody, listen up.
The party's officially over.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
Peter, can you hear me?
- Eew.
- Buckets of eew.
Edgar, something's wrong.
Yeah, I'd say.
No, I mean we killed DJ X, but I don't feel any different.
Something's wrong.
They're still vampires. Nothing's changed.
Edgar...
...this smells like garlic.
Garlic?
Let me see.
You're right, it...
They were keeping him weak.
You're the alpha.
Oh, I bet you did not see that coming.
Thanks to you.
If X had been able to drink my blood during the Blood Moon...
...my power would have passed to him...
...and that would have been a shame.
I've been the alpha for a long, long time.
You'll never grow old, you'll never die...
...but you must feed.
I brought you Edgar Frog, just like you asked.
Now it is your turn.
Remember your promise to me.
I just don't wanna grow old. Sorry.
Oh...
...you won't.
They're all yours!
Alan, wait!
No, no, no, this is not a good time for the batteries to die.
Claus, I need you to get Zoe to safety.
Edgar, I'm not leaving without you.
If we don't kill Peter right now...
...there's gonna be a thousand emo-goth vampires out there.
I need you to warn the world.
Especially in case I don't survive.
That's not an option.
I'll be waiting.
Just go.
Come on.
Claus.
I'm disappointed in you, Edgar.
This is no way to treat your savior.
Savior? You got a funny way of looking at things, kid.
I saved you from a life of Ioneliness.
You didn't want to end up like Robert Neville, did you? Ha, ha.
Robert who?
- You really should read more books, Edgar.
The ones without pictures and word balloons.
Robert Neville, the protagonist in I Am Legend.
Last man on Earth in a world full of vampires.
Is that really what you want to become?
I'm not thirsty.
You'll have to kill me first.
I will, if necessary.
But that would be a shame...
...especially since I owe you a debt for killing X.
Why didn't you just kill him yourself?
A father can't murder his own children.
That would be in bad taste.
Even an impertinent little shit like DJ X.
I told him you can't turn all the cattle into cowboys...
...you'll wind up with too many cowboys.
But he didn't listen.
And now, thanks to his damned raves...
...there are going to be far too many vampires roaming the Earth.
That's where you come in.
Keep the population down to a manageable size.
Plenty of blood to drink.
Everybody's happy.
Precisely.
Which is why I want you to keep on doing what you're already so very good at.
Hunting and killing vampires.
So you want me to be your own personal hemo-sucking hit man, is that it?
Crudely worded...
...but yes, that's the general idea.
And what makes you think...
...that I won't just kill you myself?
Nothing.
Except that you have no real reason.
Think about it, Edgar.
Your brother's already one of us.
Everyone you care about is either dead or playing for my team.
What do you say?
I say...
...why don't you go suck yourself?
Alan, kill your brother. You'll feel better.
Alan, no.
Don't do this.
You're my brother.
You're a Frog Brother.
Don't make me hurt you.
I told you not to make me hurt you.
Last chance, Edgar.
What the fuck?
Fuck you!
You okay?
Yeah.
Fang check.
Hmm.
Death to all vampires?
Maximum body count.
We are awesome monster bashers.
- The meanest.
- The baddest.
That's enough of that.
Hey. I thought you went to the beach with your brother?
I did, actually, but, uh, he wanted to stay out there longer.
He stays out much longer, he's gonna turn into a human piece of beef jerky.
I guess he's making up for lost time.
Yeah.
- Oh, guess what.
I sold your copy of Destroy All Vampires number 125...
...for 500 bucks.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
That's great.
That should keep the bank off my butt for a while.
Now, Zoe, there's something I need to ask you.
How did you know vampires are real?
Just a hunch.
What are you reading?
Oh, I'm actually scanning the book into my Kindle.
I decided, you know...
...I might as well educate myself about all the possibilities of the dark underworld.
For example, did you know that lycanthrope...
...or female werewolves, she-wolves...
...actually can change anytime they want to?
They don't have to do it under a full moon.
That's a myth.
They can turn anytime they want to.
They have complete control.
They can do it in the middle of the day.
Now, that's an interesting theory.
Hello?
Are... Are you okay?
Do you speak English?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Here.
Come in, come in. Here.
I'm gonna get you a doctor.
Lie down right here.
You're okay?
Okay, yeah, just lie down.
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
Shit.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Please.
Please, please don't.
I'll do anything. Please.
Alex?
Alex?
What?
You thirsty?
Yeah.
Okay. All right.
All right. All right.
Careful.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thank y'all. Thank y'all.
All right, all right.
We let Alex shine a little bit on that last one.
The bad news is our man won't be with us too much longer.
He's decided to leave the nest.
Fly off on his own.
Think you can handle it?
All right. Two, three, four...
Look, there's a reason why you can get a big house in the sticks for dirt cheap.
It's a wasteland.
It's not set.
I mean, one day she wants to go, the next she wants to stay.
She's all over the map.
It's a pregnancy thing.
Well, if you think it's such a great idea, then why wait?
I knew it.
You don't wanna go.
- You don't wanna go.
- It'll be fine.
Three hours away?
I'm never gonna see you.
I just can't imagine raising a baby in the city.
This house, it is like a Malibu Barbie dream house.
I mean, this would be a project for me, not some client.
And Alex is cool with it?
Absolutely.
I mean, he's in the middle of finishing up all these demos and even if just a couple of them pay off, then he can support me.
I'm very happy for you.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
You know what that look was, right?
Yes, I do.
I understand you're strapped, but she'd be just as happy with a placeholder ring.
I don't wanna be that guy.
I'm not gonna get her a piece of shit.
Okay, okay. I thought maybe you were one of those people who doesn't believe in marriage.
Your parents were married, right?
Three times each.
Now we're getting someplace.
So sorry.
When you stare at us while you're talking, then we know you're talking about us.
Women have amazing powers.
Can I get you a non-alcoholic beer?
No, we have to go back to the office.
We have to finish up some work.
- Work?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you guys are going to Chippendales, where some oily guy's gonna give her a lap dance.
I don't have a lap.
Bye.
May I?
May you what? What are you... God!
Oh, my God, my back!
It's all these things
I never thought about before.
Like, I don't have a little brother,
I don't have a little sister,
I never even babysat, and now I worry about everything, like, what if I drop him on his head?
No, I'm being serious.
They come with skulls.
My mother's a disaster.
I mean, what if that's genetic?
What if I inherit all her maternal incompetence?
I don't think there's a gene for that, Penny.
Penny?
- Penny?
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!
- Yes.
- Oh, my God!
Michael. God damn it, why don't you answer the phone?
Listen, if you're still with Alex, tell him we are at the hospital.
We can't a hold of him and Penny is in labor.
Call me when you get this.
Okay.
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.
I missed it.
It happened really fast.
I can't believe I missed it.
Come in, come on, here.
Hey.
Okay.
Thanks.
Hey.
So tell me everything.
Honestly, I don't even remember.
It's like I blacked everything out.
He's so cute.
You're so cute.
Okay. This is your dad.
Hey.
That's your dad, huh?
Boy, we can just about handle anything now, huh?
This side is up.
Hey, I know you're working, but I talked to the realtor in Stanton.
I told him if he cut his fee in half, we could close the deal right now.
He must be sick of my haggling because he went for it.
I just think we have to do it.
It's such a steal.
We'd be crazy to pass this up.
And I really believe
I can turn it into something spectacular.
Anyway, I'll grab something from Carmines on the way home.
We can start hammering it out.
I just wanna make sure you're okay with this.
If you're having any doubts at all, just let me know. Okay?
I Love you so much.
Well, it looks a little dreary in the late months.
But you know, in the spring with plants, trees, I mean, it's gonna...
We could just paint it, paint the brick.
It's from Michael.
"May this beautiful tree represent your growing love
"and blooming hopes, and blah, blah, blah."
- Does it really say, "Blah, blah, blah"?
- Yeah.
Tanner.
Hi, buddy.
You just hangin' out?
Oh, yeah.
Inspired yet?
There's something I don't mind being left behind.
Yeah, just something else we couldn't have in the city.
How would you like your rib-eye cooked?
I'm sorry. You okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Get rid of that thing.
Well, now everything we cook's gonna taste like baby.
That's not funny.
That's in the kitchen.
At back. And this one goes upstairs.
Hey, hold on! Hold on!
I'll... I'll help you with that.
Here, I'll get the door.
You've gotta be kidding me.
This was... This was supposed to be gone.
Can your guys get this shit outta here?
No, no, no.
You gotta arrange for a junk man.
I cannot put my piano in there with this stuff.
So what, just leave it here on the ground?
What is all this crap?
Sorry.
How's little T?
He's good. He's napping.
Can I give you a hand with anything?
No, but maybe later you could help me with the monitor?
Okay.
Poor girl.
Probably wondering what she did to deserve this.
A lot of crap in here.
Shit!
No!
God damn it! God damn it!
Are you on channel A or channel B?
Channel B.
Got it.
Should I put it back on the shelf?
You don't have to yell.
I can hear you through the monitor.
Okay.
Yeah, put it back on the shelf.
I think you have it pointing at the ceiling.
You need to point it down to the crib.
All right, that's it.
Just move it a little bit to the left.
What's wrong?
Oh, God.
Where are you taking my mom?
I'm sorry, babe.
I love your mother, but the effect with the camera was a little creepy.
- Well, what about the monitor?
- It's good.
Move it two inches to the right.
What's going' on with him?
I don't know, but I cannot go back in there.
That counts as a turn.
Oh, God.
What the hell is that?
Oh, my God.
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.
I don't know.
- Let's go see.
- Yeah.
I don't understand.
I'll check it out.
Why don't you take him inside?
I'm gonna throw up.
How could we not know?
We saw it on a Sunday.
We moved in on a Sunday.
We can't live like this.
With Tanner not sleeping?
It was his first night like that.
We'll... We'll get rest.
You need quiet.
I'll manage.
I mean, that was the whole point.
Nah, we'll be fine.
I mean, how long can this last?
A few weeks?
Bitch!
Alex?
Son of a bitch!
These dumbasses didn't hook up the dryer exhaust.
I could hear you all the way upstairs in the bathroom.
I didn't know I was that loud.
No, it must be the pipes.
Just another charming idiosyncrasy of this house.
I got it.
You know, I don't like you leaving the baby alone up there like that.
No, I... I've got the internet hooked up.
He's just watching porn.
Okay.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you... What are you doing?
Come on.
Play something.
Hey.
I need help with the baby.
Look, I just need you to bathe him for me.
I have to go lie down.
Okay.
Make sure you clean the sink before you put him in, okay?
Wait. I don't put the baby in the sink full of dirty dishes?
Shut up.
I'm gonna put you right here.
Right there.
Look at that.
You ready for your bath?
I found Tanner's blankie.
It was in the guest room.
Hey, buddy.
Look what I found in the guest room.
I found your blankie.
Yeah.
Yeah, do you like that?
God, what is the matter with you?
God!
Did you not think to check the water?
I did check it, when I was filling it up.
Oh, my God.
If I hadn't come in here...
I can't even leave the baby alone with you for one minute.
I can't do everything myself.
No, just go. I've got it. Don't even.
What are you doing on the floor?
Hey.
You're getting heavy.
It's their lunch break.
Let's see if we can get some sleep for an hour.
Penny?
Penny?
Hey.
What happened?
Here. Let me take him.
Come on.
Come on. Come on. You're freaking' me out.
- No.
- Penny.
- I'm fine.
- Hey, hey.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Talk to me.
What just happened in there?
Don't yell at me, all right?
I'm tired and I'm... I'm scared.
What are you scared of?
I saw...
What?
Somebody in the house.
It was through the mirror.
She ran by and then she was gone.
I don't know. Maybe I was asleep.
I can't even see straight anymore.
I'm losing it, too.
They say people start to hallucinate.
It's a fact.
I goggled it.
I don't know if I can stand much more of this.
I need to sleep.
I mean, how long has it been?
Five days?
Something like that.
I've lost track.
It'll get better.
I promise.
Get out!
Penny?
Penny.
Penny.
Wake up.
God! What?
What's going on?
You okay?
Yeah.
I just had a really weird dream.
At least you're sleeping.
Can you turn out the light?
Oh, God.
I can handle it.
I can handle it.
I know we haven't known each other, just maybe a few months now, but normally I'm not a train wreck.
You know, I'm actually really fun.
Like, not like party girl fun, but fun.
Damn it!
Pretend you didn't see that.
If daddy sells one of his demos...
He'll pay for therapy.
For both of us.
Hey, Alex. It's Michael. Friday.
I Left a message for you the other day.
How's the house?
All that peace and quiet driving you crazy yet?
Johanna and I would Love to come down and check the place out.
I'm sure you're ready to get drunk and admit that you screwed up.
Because you know you screwed up, right?
Big time. What were you thinking?
This is your Life now.
Your whole entire Life is nothing but that house.
You haven't written a demo, not one verse, not one note of music the whole time you've been here.
You just stagger around Like a zombie, having nightmares about a woman, because she told you she saw a woman in the house.
She put it in your head and now Look at you.
Is that what you wanted?
What the hell are you doing?
Did you not see
Tanner sitting here right in front of you?
Why did you leave him at the top of the stairs?
I didn't put him there!
You're telling me that you didn't put him in the wagon and set him right there?
Yes, I put him in the wagon, but I had him in the nursery.
You just said you didn't put him in there.
Did you or did you not...
I didn't put him at the top of the stairs, Alex!
Okay. You have got to manage this situation better, all right?
I did not put him at the top of the stairs, Alex!
You just said you put him in the wagon!
I didn't.
You're walking around in a complete stupor!
- Okay, I gotta get outta here.
- It was probably you!
I'm gonna go to the store.
Sweetie, put some shoes on.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I...
Are you sure you're okay to drive?
I just drifted off for a second.
You forgot the list.
I talked to Dr. Gordon.
He said try gripe water.
He may be having gas at night.
Gripe water.
All right.
Are you sure you're okay to leave?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Okay.
Don't be gone long.
Thank you.
Whoa!
For a second there,
I thought you were the Grim Reaper.
I'm too young to die!
So I would normally never ask a customer this, but are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm hangin' in there, I suppose.
New baby?
Five months old.
Doesn't sleep?
Not when he's supposed to.
He's got it all upside-down.
They got a term for it.
It's called day/night confusion.
That'd be a really good name for a band.
What?
You like babies?
I wouldn't choose to, like, hang out with one, but I know sometimes it can't be helped.
Are you asking me if I'll babysit for you?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yes.
- Does your TV work?
- You'll do it?
You didn't answer my question about the TV.
Okay, all right, look, our cable doesn't work.
But our DVD player works great.
Okay, okay. Take it easy.
Okay, so you'll do it?
I mean, we just need someone to...
Who will stay the night with the baby.
That, I mean, that's it.
- Okay.
- I can trust you?
You can totally trust me.
Like, I'm not gonna touch your liquor cabinet.
I had one too many wine coolers once when I was 14, so I don't touch the stuff.
Smart girl.
Yeah.
So, I normally would ask 10 an hour, but since I'm gonna be doing this overnight...
Whatever you want. I mean... Here.
Okay.
Yeah, you just gave me a hundred, so...
Hi.
So I have a baby brother and a baby sister.
And my older sister has a baby.
And my older brother has a baby.
You wanna hear about my cousins?
No, that's... No, that's good.
Nice place.
So, if he sleeps, then you can bring him upstairs to his crib.
But what's been happening since we moved in here is he wakes up every 15 minutes.
If that's the case, I would just keep him down here.
You know you don't put him to sleep on his belly, right?
Yeah, of course.
And if he... If he's sleeping' and you get tired, you know, you can just crash out on the couch.
Or we have Coke in the fridge.
Or coffee. We have a coffee maker.
No, I don't do caffeine.
Really?
She doesn't drink either.
And no red meat.
If that matters.
Well, that's actually kind of cool.
But really, I don't want you to worry about me.
Or the baby, of course.
I slept all day.
So this is not gonna be a problem for me to make it through the night.
But you know what I can't do?
I can't carry both of you guys upstairs.
So, y'all might want to be thinking about bed, huh?
Yeah. Yeah.
You guys need one of those, like, electric chairs that carries you up and down the stairs.
What?
Nothing.
Never mind.
Electric chair.
I think she was making a joke.
Thank you for this.
You were right.
I love hearing you say I'm right.
Get some sleep.
You don't think there's something wrong with this place, do you?
I think one good night's sleep and all this shit's gonna go away.
Okay?
Yeah.
Hal?
We're doing good down here.
I think he's gonna stay down for a while.
Do you wanna put him in his crib?
Or should I do it?
Do you want me to...
You know what? I'm gonna get him for you.
It was too good to last.
Need more sleep.
Like 24 hours more.
How about 12 more hours? Deal?
12 more, honey.
Sunday.
They have to take the day off.
Sunday.
It's the Lord's day.
Hallelujah.
Come on. Let's go see Tanner and pay her and see if she can come back.
What kind of person would you let in this house?
Penny.
Some teenager you met at the grocery store!
Penny, calm down.
No references!
I mean, we don't even know her last name!
Do you even know her first name?
I mean, what is going on with this house that someone would leave in the middle of the night?
You're... You're taking it too far.
No, I'm not!
Penny, please!
- Stop, okay?
- Stop what?
Look. I know it's wrong.
I take full responsibility.
But she's gone, for whatever reason.
The baby was in the crib.
And we were a few feet away in our room, sleeping.
We didn't even have our monitor on!
Something could have happened!
People did not have baby monitors throughout the entirety of human history until a couple of years ago!
And babies died every night their cribs!
Penny, please.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
You guys get in your trucks!
And you get the hell out of here!
Look, look, friend, what you...
What the hell is the matter with you?
You're not making any sense.
Don't you assholes have any children?
- Don't be stupid.
- What you're doing is illegal!
I'm gonna shut this operation down!
There's nothing illegal about what we're doing'!
You cannot do construction on Sunday!
Okay, it's okay, man.
We've all been in your shoes. You know?
It's happened to me, trust me, more than once.
You tied one on Saturday night, induced yourself into a junior coma, and you lost an entire day.
Welcome to Monday.
If you got a sick day, I think I'd call in.
It looks like you could use a little more shut eye.
Why don't you go crawl back in bed.
I'll make sure we keep it down.
You have to get out right now.
Do you hear me?
There's a ghost in the house.
- I've seen it.
- Get in the fucking' car and start driving.
Why won't you believe me?
I haven't done anything wrong.
God damn it, why won't you believe me?
You think this isn't hard for me?
Wake up! Why are you lying to me?
I'm sorry.
I didn't picture our life quite like this.
You must hate it.
The rain is nice.
They'll probably have to stop.
Isn't the rain nice?
I can't remember your name.
I'm sorry.
You see her, too.
I'm not crazy.
Please!
Please! Please! Please!
Please! Please!
The baby's asleep.
I don't know if you've realized, but it's actually quiet right now.
This is the first time since we moved in this place that I can actually get some work done.
So if you have any love left in your heart for me, could you please, please stop pounding on the window?
I'm sorry our whole nightmarish ordeal is undermining your ability to play piano.
You have got to let me get some work done.
All you can think about is work when we're in the fifth level of hell?
I know how difficult this is for you.
Difficult? What is wrong with you, Alex?
There's something wrong with this house!
There's something horrible here.
Penny, whatever you think is going on, okay, whatever you think you see... it's not real.
I've got something.
I want you to take these.
- Look...
- No.
I know you're scared. I'm scared, too.
We are falling apart.
We cannot function like this.
I can help you.
Please don't do this.
- I could take care of Tanner.
- No...
No, I'll take care of him and then you sleep.
I have to be here to protect him.
Don't you understand?
Then something's gonna happen.
It's the only way we're gonna get through this.
God, I want to go home.
I want to go home.
You just need to get some sleep.
Here.
Take these.
No.
What are you doing?
Stay away from me.
Stay away from you?
All I've ever done is taken care of you and the baby.
The baby?
You wanted this baby just as much as you wanted to move into this house.
That's not true.
You think I'm an idiot?
You think I'm stupid, huh?
You can't do this to me!
You can't treat me like this!
I said stay away from me.
I would never hurt you.
I would never hurt you!
All I've ever done is given you everything you wanted!
Take the fucking pills!
No.
How are you feeling?
Are you feeling anything?
That smells good.
Can I have some?
All right. Sorry.
Switch.
Did you think I forgot about you?
I didn't forget about you, noodle.
I'd never forget about you.
I know you're sitting right there.
Oh, my God.
Tanner.
Tanner? Tanner?
Alex!
Alex! Alex, wake up!
Wake up! Alex! Wake up!
Come on, wake up! Alex!
Wake up!
I did something terrible.
I can't find Tanner. You gotta help me.
Please wake up. Please wake up.
Please, please, wake up.
The national weather service has issued a flash flood warning for Harold County until 10.:30 p.m., Central Standard Time.
At 6.:55 Central Standard Time the public reported water flowing over the following roads...
I-45 between Carlos Road and James Street, I-40...
Honey, you've gotta wake up!
Alex! Alex! Wake up!
You've gotta wake up.
We have to go get Tanner.
Alex, wake up, we have to get Tanner.
Alex!
There's something here.
There's something here that's gonna get us.
I'm not going crazy.
I'm not crazy.
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?
Do you believe me? Do you believe?
Did you hear that? Can you hear?
Go away!
Go away!
No! No!
No! No!
I just want my baby.
Tanner?
Go to hell.
You're not real.
Oh, God!
Michael!
Good god. What's happened to you?
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?
Hey. Calm down.
No, no, no, you don't understand.
I have to go find Tanner.
Take it easy. I've got you.
I'm gonna get help. Okay?
- No, please, Michael, let go of me.
- I've got you.
I'm gonna go and get some help.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just relax. Just relax.
What the hell? What's going on here?
She's not real.
She's not real.
Help me.
She's not real.
She's not real.
She's not real.
She's not real. She's not real.
She's not real. She's not real.
She's not real.
- Penny...
- She's not real.
She's not real. She's not real.
She's not real. She's not real.
Penny. Penny, you've gotta tell me what's going on here.
She's not real. She's not real.
She's not real. She's real.
She's real. She's real.
Real, real, real, real, real, real.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Okay.
Okay.
Stay away...
From my family!
Help me.
Oh, God.
Remember, we will not be undersold.
It's been more than 6 weeks since a local woman wandered away from her hospital room in Stanton only to disappear.
The woman was being treated for shock following the death of her 8-month-old daughter who perished when a fire broke out at their home in Butler County.
Rescue efforts tapered off after multiple searches in the neighbourhood turned up nothing.
But the case is getting a second Look after the disappearance of another woman in the same town.
19-Year-old Nancy Leggero was reported missing this week after failing to show up at the supermarket where she worked.
Police in Butler County are now wondering if there may be a connection in the disappearance of the two women.
Hello, what's this?
- No!
- What's this?
- Do you have to be a troublemaker?
- You think you're going to church?
We're going to church. We're going to church. We are going!
Come on, come on.
Do you want to get the door?
Thank you, Justin.
Thanks.
One of the most anointed men of God
I've ever met. I think you know my son.
- Yeah!
- I think you know my son. Yeah.
The Reverend Cotton Marcus. Let's give another hand for Jesus!
'I started preaching pretty young.
My father was a preacher.'
Every preacher has to have a hook to bring the people in, get 'em saved and get them in their wallet cos the church doesn't run on love.
The child preacher was a great novelty.
He groomed me. Other kids were playing and I'd be learning the Gospel of John.
By the time he invited me up on the pulpit one Sunday as a surprise to let the people in the congregation know that the Holy Spirit had visited his son, as spontaneous as that act may have seemed to the congregation, we were... we were ready.
I'm sayin' right here, if you want an answer, if you want to know...
Do you want to know? It's right here, it's right here, brother.
Cotton is quite a character. He's what you would call a performer.
A showman. He's a natural creative.
For example, we have a local theatre here.
Cotton writes plays and he's making these little mini-movies now.
He's built props for them, special effects.
He entertains like nobody's business.
It starts here with us, but it carries on into his professional life.
Yes, you do!
'So many churches are boring.
People don't want to go.
'But when Cotton is there, it is never boring.'
Folks, I'm here to tell you today that the world is filled with many, many faces.
Amen.
Right? Some of those faces are good.
They're right with God.
- And some faces will lie to you.
- You gotta watch out for 'em!
Absolutely. So I'm here to tell you, make sure you don't fall for a pretty face.
Cos that pretty face just may indeed be the Prince of Lies.
- That's right.
- (Applause)
Cos I'll tell you right now, his lies are everywhere.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah!
You get 'em going, you "hallelujah" and blood of Christ, they love the blood.
When you get 'em in the right spot, they're not even listening.
- No, they're listening.
- No, I could talk about anything.
I could talk about my mom's banana bread recipe. You don't think so?
Now you're underestimating your crowd.
When I go back in there, I will preach a banana bread sermon. I bet you ten bucks.
Do you believe that if you allow the Holy Ghost into your heart, you can be sent to the Kingdom of God?
- Amen!
- You gotta get an "amen".
- Amen!
- Gotta get a "hallelujah".
Gotta get a "hallelujah" and an "amen".
If you get two ripe bananas, you put 'em in a bowl, put some sugar and bake 'em, you can have banana bread.
Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah! Yes, you can!
One Jesus! One Jesus!
We're in my dad's office. That's very special. He doesn't let anybody in here.
- Don't let 'em see the combination, Dad.
- I won't.
Yeah, please don't film this combination.
I'm serious.
To be honest with you, I'm the only one that knows it. Me and my accountant.
This is the Hortus Delicarum.
There's about 20 in the whole world.
(Cotton) Show it to them.
This book describes the various kinds of demons, helps you identify them, and then recommends the process for getting rid of that demon.
We have had exorcists in our family... for generations, generations.
And...
How many exorcisms do you think you've done with this book?
150. 150 exorcisms, yeah.
The original story of Lucifer is this.
Lucifer was an angel at one point.
Some people say that he was the choirmaster of Heaven.
He was helping raise hosannas to God.
But he decided he wanted the praise himself and God cast him out of Heaven.
He took a third of the host of Heaven with him. Those are your demons today.
That is the set-up of the entire Bible.
The soul of man is being fought over.
God wants you to turn to the light of him and Satan wants to grab your soul.
Satan wants to overthrow
God, so you have this clash.
The Bible is filled with demons.
If you believe in God, you have to believe in the devil. Jesus was an exorcist.
Therefore, if you're a Christian and you believe in Jesus Christ, you have to believe in demons.
Mostly people contact me by my website.
But this, this is old school.
Here...
That's from lvanwood.
This is from Georgia.
And this one says, "Please open immediately. Urgent."
Exorcism is alive and well in the present age.
People think of it as being a scourge of the Middle Ages that somehow went away and was cured by science, but it's never gone away.
Exorcism today is bigger than it's ever been.
The Vatican used to have 20 or 25 sanctioned exorcists on the staff.
Now they have well over 300. That's just what they're telling is.
They're not telling us everything.
That's just the Roman Catholic Church.
They get all the press cos they got the movie, but the reality is that exorcisms are performed by every religion all over the world.
"Local boy Cotton delivers his first exorcism."
As a boy, I thought this was in every newspaper all over the world.
Tell me what your dad does.
He fights with the demons and the vampires and the ghosts.
And all the monsters.
He fights all the ghosts and the demons and the vampires?
- And the monsters.
- Do you believe in ghosts?
Does your dad believe in ghosts?
I do not believe in actual demons, no.
But when I was doing exorcisms, you know, I acted like I did.
It's not like I saw any demons come out of anybody.
So for years, you've just been a fraud?
That's your word, not mine.
For the last couple of years, I've been doing what I've always been doing which is delivering a service for a person who needs it in a way that they need it.
I'm not saying I'm a doctor, but I helped heal people from what ailed them.
What ailed them was the thought that they were possessed by a devil.
If I helped make that thought go away and they felt better, so be it.
I got a wife, a family to feed. At least, that's how I used to justify it.
(Shanna) Basically, everything changed when Justin was born. He was born early, so there was a while where we weren't sure our son was going to be alive, then finally, we found out that he was going to be OK.
In that moment, Cotton was so relieved.
He was like, "We are so lucky, we are so lucky."
The best I could do was say, "Thank you, Doctor."
I should've been thanking God, but that wasn't my first thought.
And that realisation really shook me.
That was a real crisis of faith.
I started to question if
I ever believed in God.
I started preaching so early and kept going.
I was good and I got rewarded for it, so who wants to stop that?
Even when I had this revelation of
"maybe I don't believe in God",
"yet I'm still presenting myself as a preacher," it didn't stop me.
I mean, I was on autopilot.
That's what I do.
It wasn't easy. It got harder.
There's no doubt about that.
He would've quit eventually, at some point anyway, but there was this one story, this little boy named Victor.
His name was Victor Turoy from Harrisburg, Texas.
This little boy was autistic and he was suffocated to death during an exorcism with well-meaning people trying to get this demon out of him.
I read that article and Justin was about this boy's age.
I started having this recurring nightmare.
I was the exorcist wrapping a plastic bag around my son's head.
I was watching my son die and
I'd wake up in a cold sweat.
Not long after that, I was washing dishes and he came out of the office and he had this story about the new
Pope opening an Exorcism Academy.
He was visibly shaken. He said,
"Do you know how many more people this will hurt?"
That's when I really decided that... I was done. I had to get out of that.
I'm not interested in participating in that whatsoever.
What I want to do is expose exorcism for the scam that it really is.
That's why we're doing this. If I can help expose it for what it really is and save one kid from having a plastic bag wrapped around his face...
That sounds like God's work.
We will open an envelope and follow that request wherever it takes us.
And I'll let you follow me.
And that way, you can film all the behind the scenes of my exorcism.
I'll pick the one on top. It's from lvanwood, Louisiana.
There's a whole bunch of people out there who are convinced they are possessed or they have some sort of crop failure or something wrong with the livestock.
"I feel I am dealing with a case of possession by the devil himself.
"My livestock is being slaughtered nightly.
"Little doubt who is doing this gruesome...
"Please, please..." Looks like we're going to lvanwood.
Get Daddy's candlesticks, OK?
- See you later. Love you.
- Give me a hug.
Oh! You just really...
Bye, guys. Love you!
It's amazing down here. It's got a real unique feel.
Nothing like it in any other part of the country. And it's ancient.
Some plantations here have been standing for hundreds of years.
It's the only part of the country that's been flown under six different flags, so it's a real mix of culture and superstition and folklore down here.
You've got voodoo, you've got
Roman Catholics, Pentecostalism, all these different beliefs rubbing up against one another.
They're all looking to save you and to be the answer.
There's a lot of illiteracy and a lot of poverty and between that and the "stopped in time" feel of the place, it's like a perfect breeding ground for... for demons and evil.
You can't fight the devil without the armour.
Granted it's linen, but it's hot down here.
Sorry. Sorry.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss this.
Maybe I'll sell real estate.
I'm turning on to
Louisiana Interstate 39.
I Demons comin' your way... I
If you ask five people about a demon story, they'll give you ten demon stories.
- Do we have time for that?
- Sure. Absolutely.
- Is Bush that way?
- Yeah. You be careful goin' down Bush.
You hear so many things.
I think that the very gates to Hell is right over there off of Bush
Drive, the very gates to Hell!
There was a cult in this area and a temple.
It's not here. I won't be able to describe exactly where it is, but the Sweetzers will be able to give you specifics.
This guy that ran the cult was so disturbed that he actually thought that he would, like...
He needed to, like, feed, you know, feed human souls to the devil or whatever.
Where's the UFO landing site?
Oh, that is actually in that direction.
Maybe we could ask this guy.
- He's stopping.
- He is?
- Hey, afternoon!
- Are you guys making a movie?
- A documentary. How's it going?
- I like documentaries.
- We're looking for the Sweetzer farm.
- What's your name?
- Reverend Cotton Marcus.
- Pleased to meet you.
- The Sweetzer farm?
- And yours?
I'm Iris. This is Daniel. We're a little behind schedule, so...
- No problem.
- The Sweetzer farm, please?
You're going in the wrong direction.
You wanna make a U-turn.
- OK.
- Take this road, go straight.
When you see things you've already seen, keep on going. You'll hit the highway. OK?
And then I want you to go back where you came from.
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not.
Gotcha. Thank you.
Sorry about that.
- Jesus!
- Keep going!
- What's he doing?
- Jesus Christ, just go, go!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
It seems like the end of the road.
There's a tractor. That's a good sign.
Here's a farmhouse of some sorts.
This has got to be it.
Let me just make sure it's him before you guys get out, OK?
- Mr Sweetzer?
- Yeah.
How are you doin'?
Cotton Marcus.
Nice to meet you. Pardon my dress, but it's a work day.
- I'm dressed for work myself.
- I understand that.
I can't thank you enough for coming out here.
I just figured... Oh, hey, watch out for this kid!
- We just met him on the road.
- I apologise. That's my son Caleb.
- My apologies.
- No. What did he do?
It was probably just a misunderstanding.
We asked for... It doesn't matter.
- Hi. Good to see you again.
- Hi.
- What's your problem, boy?
- You know they got cameras?
- You got cameras?
- I was gonna tell you.
- These are my friends. This is Iris.
- Hi. How are you?
- And Daniel.
- Hi.
I appreciate it. I'd like you to turn the camera off though.
Let's go ahead and turn it off right now.
And let's go talk about it.
This is the second bull I've lost.
Two goats and, I don't know, several chickens.
Could this have come from an alligator?
An alligator will bite and roll and take chunks, not a big, straight cut like that.
- Caleb couldn't have done this?
- No, I'm sure it was Nell.
- And Nell is...?
- My daughter.
Right, I knew that. I remember that from the letter.
I should have read the letter more thoroughly.
I thought it was
Louis, not Nell.
I don't like working with kids.
That's from last night. One just like this every time I lose an animal.
- She doesn't remember this?
- No, sir, she doesn't remember anything.
And it really frightened her a lot, so I just quit asking her about it.
- Hello. Is that Nell?
- Yes. Hello, Reverend Marcus.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come this way.
- This is my room.
- Did you do this?
- Yeah.
- Wonderful.
Thank you.
This is actually the story of Esther of Antioch. She's not from the Bible.
It was something I dreamed of.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
This artwork and detail, it's really well thought out. I'm very, very impressed.
Sorry.
If you don't mind, Nell, tell me how you're feeling, what's been going on.
Your dad told me about the livestock.
What do you know about that?
Well, I can only think one thing, that I killed 'em.
Do you remember killing them?
- No, but...
- Do you remember getting out of bed?
- Walking down the stairs or outside?
- No.
Do you remember doing anything to the animals at all?
- No, but...
- Maybe you didn't do anything at all.
As I mentioned in my letter, my wife died two years ago. It was cancer.
And she was being treated, we thought, successfully, for breast cancer, then six months later, it metastasised into her bones and three weeks after that, she was gone.
It was quite a shock, especially for Nell.
She's 14, just coming into young womanhood, so it was very difficult.
I saw that picture. You look just like your mother.
Really? Thank you so much. That's such a compliment. She's so beautiful.
- She is. So is her daughter.
- Thank you so much.
- Were you very close?
- She was my best friend.
Yeah, that's safe to say.
She was my best friend.
Did Caleb act any different after your mom passed?
I think Caleb got frustrated.
He got kinda scary. He started hating God a lot.
How about your father? How has he been affected?
It hit him very hard.
It hit him, 0h...
If it weren't for my wife Dell and the faith that she instilled in me,
I don't think I would've made it through.
Since she died, I have been determined to give my children a more fundamental Christian upbringing.
I'm not real crazy about the influences that exist in the world today.
Therefore, I decided to home-school Nell.
For a while, I let her go to the Sunday school at our local church, but that didn't seem right either.
Pastor Manley didn't teach only religious music, so that's why he pulled me out...
- Your dad likes religious music?
- Yeah.
I've tried keeping her as close as I possibly could, maybe even a little too protective, I'll admit to that.
But somehow, still... the devil got in her.
Her mother gave her a small crucifix and it burns her.
The symbol of our Lord and she can't wear it.
I don't know if it's Nell who's killing those animals.
I know she's really isolated out here.
That's got to drive you crazy.
But the burning cross? That's just like a nickel allergy.
You get a reaction like that on your skin, especially if you're stressed out.
- Hey, son.
- Hi.
Why were you throwing rocks at me?
Are you still gonna perform that exorcism?
An exorcism? Well, I don't know.
That's what I'm here to find out.
Cos apparently, there's deaths involved.
People have died.
If you're worried about that, nothing like that happens with me. I'm here to help.
We don't need your help, though.
Your livestock do. They're dying left and right. Do you know about that?
My father's a superstitious drunk.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Do you think he's superstitious or drunk enough to harm his own animals?
It's possible. I don't know.
Do you think Nell had anything to do with it?
No, I don't think
Nell's the problem.
- Nell doesn't need help.
- That remains to be seen...
If anything happens to her, I will hurt you and I don't care if the camera is watching.
It can watch all it wants.
I will hurt you.
Hmm.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, son.
Thank you.
- Nice and relaxed. You're not nervous?
- No.
OK, cos you can't be nervous when I do this.
- OK.
- Let's try again.
- Feel any pressure?
- A little.
Oh, you do? Oh.
My throat's been sore cos I've been waking up screaming.
- You have a sore throat as well?
- Cos I've been waking up screaming.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
It's fine.
Night sweats and night fevers and a little loss of appetite and fatigue in the afternoon...
- Whoa!
- What?
- (Louis) What?
- And, uh...
- (Louis) What?
- Let me have your finger. Come here.
Right back here. Can you feel that?
That indention. Look straight ahead.
Have you always had it this deep?
I guess it's deeper now, but...
It's a lot deeper now. Louis, get me a pan of water, big enough to put her feet in.
- Pan of water?
- Yeah.
I need you to take your socks and shoes off. Very pretty shoes.
Oh. Thank you.
I like your shoes.
They're real nifty.
Want to try 'em on?
Here you go.
- They look good on you.
- They look...
- They're yours.
- No way, Miss Iris!
- I got a pair in the car.
- No, please!
You look good in them and I'm sure you can't find them in a 300-mile radius.
This is the nicest thing that's happened.
Dad, Miss Iris gave me her boots!
Let's take them off your feet right now.
How about that for starters?
There you go.
OK, lift them up.
Let's all close our eyes for a moment.
Let's close our eyes and pray to Jesus to help us out in this time of need.
Oh, Lord, we ask you to please give us your strength.
Give us your hope and give us your clarity.
Please help us.
We ask you, please take care of Nell.
And in this test, may you please show us an unadulterated sign of whether or not we should continue upon this way, if we should continue down the path...
Reverend Marcus!
- Is this regular water?
- Yes.
That's the temperature change.
I was afraid of this. We will proceed with the exorcism.
I'm afraid that I suspect that Nell is possessed with the demon named...
- "A-BA-lam"?
- "AH-balam".
"Host..." What is this? What kind of language is this?
- Do you not read Latin?
- No, sir.
It's all right. I got it for you.
What this tells us is...
- Inside Abalam...
- Right.
What it says is he's very powerful, perhaps the most powerful demon in the entire book.
Like a snake, he wraps himself around the coil of the soul of the person.
That is why there's the temperature fluctuation, up, down, like Nell showed.
The thing about Abalam is he preys on the flesh of the innocent.
He defiles the flesh of the innocent.
That's what he does.
Defile...?
And it's particularly bad when he's in young girls.
Look at him.
It says right here that the possessed's only salvation will come... in death.
What? The only salvation is death?
Unless she is exorcised.
Here, fraud!
Hello, Caleb.
You threw something in there.
I saw you. But I won't tell, OK?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That was really good.
We won't have any problems now.
This'll shake nicely.
Come in.
Come now. Stand here for a second.
Caleb, if you would, over there, Louis beside you.
Nell, go ahead. Get on the bed.
You can sit or you can lay down.
Whatever makes you comfortable.
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes, sir.
Good. Nothing to be nervous about.
Gentlemen, I do not need your help unless I ask for it.
- What I need from you is your faith.
- Yes, sir.
Your courage and your love because we are here because we love Nell.
And we want Nell to get better.
Isn't that right?
Yes, Reverend.
Let's pray to the Lord our God above.
Let us close our eyes.
Beside restful waters, he leads me, he refreshes my soul.
He guides me in the right paths for his name's sake.
Even though I walk in the dark valley, I shall fear no evil, for you are by my side with your rod and your staff that give me courage.
- Do you believe in Jesus Christ, Nell?
- Yes, sir.
- Can he get this demon out of you?
- Yes, sir.
Then let him expel the demon from you.
I say, "Demon, be gone!"
In the name of Jesus Christ, I say, "Demon, leave this girl!"
In the name of Jesus Christ and the blood that washes over her, demon, be gone!
I command thee to be gone!
' (Growling) " Ah!"
Oh, no, demon. Don't listen.
Pay no attention.
Don't listen at all.
- (Loud thump)
- Agh!
- Agh, agh!
- Oh, no. No, no.
Don't worry. Don't listen, Louis.
Pay no attention.
Aaaagh!
Pay no attention for he is the Father of Lies. All he knows are lies.
All we know is the Father of
Love, the Prince of Peace, the God above who shall save you all, save you all.
For the power and name and the glory of Jesus Christ...
Sound is so important.
I got my player.
I go ahead and programme over
800 different demon sounds.
Aaaah, aaaah...
Trust in the Lord. The Lord shall save you.
The Lord shall provide for you.
- He's here!
- Do you believe in Christ?
Do you believe that Christ shall heal you?
Can Christ heal you?
- Christ can heal me.
- Then be healed.
- Yes, be healed. Say, "I love Jesus."
- I love Jesus.
- Say, "I love Jesus." Believe in Jesus.
- Aaaaagh!
These are two nine-volt batteries and attached are wires at the end.
Then you run one of the wires down the sleeve, then you attach it in there.
Believe, believe, believe, believe!
Believe, B E L I EVE!
Aaaaagh!
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you to leave!
In the blood of Christ, demon, get thee out!
I can't do it!
You have to! You have to!
God, take me!
- Take the demon from this girl, Lord!
- Aagh! Aagh!
Take the demon, oh, Lord!
Let me take the demon!
Praise God.
The demon is gone.
The demon is gone. The demon could not withstand the sight of our Lord.
Praise God.
- Are you OK?
- (She sighs)
- How's she doing?
- She's sleeping like a child.
- Got a little smile on her face.
- That's fantastic.
- Is it all there?
- There's no reason to count it.
- Take care.
- Thank you all.
- Thank you.
- What?
- No, I was just saying thank you...
- What?
- I can't hear you.
- Reverend?
I don't understand.
Reverend?
The Lord has a prophecy for you, Louis.
The Lord says he knows your pain.
He knows you're sad for your wife to be gone.
The Lord says, "Rejoice, for she is with him."
The Lord does not want you to bottle it up inside. The Lord does not want you to stuff your anger and sorrow into this bottle and drink from it.
- He does not want you to do that or hide.
- No, I won't.
He wants you to smash that bottle and in its place he wants you to accept love.
- He wants you to accept the Lord's love.
- I will. Thank you, Lord.
That was highly impressive.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Much more than I expected.
- Hey, Louis!
- Yes, sir?
Just remember, I took the devil out of your house, but it's your job to keep him out.
Yes, I'll do that. Are you sure I can't convince you all to stay with us?
No, thank you for your hospitality. We'll find a motel up the road. Take care.
Oh, she did? Why don't you put her on?
Can you do that for me?
I love you too. Brush your teeth.
Brush 'em.
Justin said you were crying. Is that true?
What's going on?
We're paid up on that. He needs a new hearing aid. We are paid up. I'm sure.
Who's Cassandra?
You know, I used to want to have a TV ministry.
I thought that'd be cool.
And now, frankly, all I really want is health insurance.
- You got what you needed today?
- Yes, really awesome stuff. Thank you.
- All right.
- You have a good night.
- Good night. Good night.
- (Daniel) Good night.
- What is she doing here?
- I don't know.
I don't know. She hasn't said a word.
Nell, can you hear me? She hasn't responded to anything.
- Where's her dad?
- I have no idea.
I woke up and she was standing here.
- Nell? Nell?
- Just stay back, OK?
Nell, are you OK, honey?
Honey, can you hear me?
I'm going to call her dad.
Honey...
I'm not getting any answer.
Nell, stop!
(Cotton) OK, we need to get her to a hospital.
Nell, hey...
Cotton!
I've seen people react, but not ten hours after the fact in my hotel room.
Their farm is five miles from the hotel.
How did she know where I was staying?
That's why I don't work with kids.
Is there a doctor around? We have a little girl who's sick.
- Where are you going with that camera?
- He's with us.
- He'll have to turn the camera off.
- He won't shoot inside.
I need him to take it outside.
We don't allow filming in here.
No problem.
What part of "turn the camera off" do you not get? Take it outside!
Excuse me, sir.
- Is that the doctor?
- Yes. That camera is turned off?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes, yes.
We got most of the blood tests back and everything appears to be normal.
We'll let her continue to rest right now.
- Can you run psychiatric tests on her?
- No, we need the parents' permission.
We're going to wait for the rest of the tests to come back.
- This is Mr Sweetzer.
- I'd like to see my daughter.
Mr Sweetzer, wait just a minute. Let me see if I can get the doctor.
She was standing babbling, then lying on the bed?
- Why didn't you call me?
- I did, but nobody answered.
Louis, I feel very strongly that she needs some professional to take a look at her.
She's a young girl.
- Mr Sweetzer, if you could sign this...
- What is this?
That will be a release for your daughter.
- It's not about a test or anything?
- No, sir.
Do you have a form for him to sign to get psychiatric tests?
- He hasn't asked for one.
- Louis...
- No.
- I'll let him talk to the doctor.
It's the sort of thing for a young girl, considering what she's been through...
- Here she comes now.
- Mr Sweetzer!
Nell, how are you doin'?
Do you remember being at the hotel last night?
- Did you know you were at his hotel?
- I think so.
- Do you want to talk to the doctor?
- No, I don't.
- What happened, Reverend?
- I believe the demon has gone.
It's as if Nell's house had been vandalised.
The robber has gone, but we need somebody else to put things right.
Don't slough it off to the big city doctor thing!
Eight of 'em could not save my wife.
They could not prolong her life one day!
And psychiatry?
Psychiatry is not of God!
Louis, the tools that God provides for us sometimes are not always the tools that we recognise...
Our weapons of war are not carnal.
They are mighty in God for the pulling down of strongholds.
Am I right? Am I right?
- Yes, yes, absolutely. Amen to that.
- That's what we're dealing with.
He's stuck in this idea that I'm some sort of slick, big city preacher.
He's not gonna listen to anything I have to say. Let's get somebody local.
It's got to be that one over there.
- Hi.
- Good afternoon.
- I'm Reverend Marcus from Baton Rouge.
- I'm Becky.
- Nice to meet you.
- From where?
Baton Rouge. I'm looking for
Pastor Manley, if he's around?
Yes, he's right back there.
What y'all doin'?
- We're making a movie.
- Oh!
So, are y'all shootin' this now?
- Yeah.
- So will I be in it?
- Yeah, you will.
- Oh!
Pastor Manley, we've got us some visitors!
Afternoon. Reverend Cotton
Marcus from Baton Rouge.
- Welcome to Second Calvary.
- Thank you.
I know he respects the church, but at this point, since I'm an outsider, he's not respecting my opinion.
I'm pushing him to see a doctor cos she's not well.
I was hoping you could back me up.
Let me tell you my history with Louis.
When she was unexpectedly pulled out of the Sunday school, we never found out exactly why, but he was definitely hostile.
He felt that our Sunday School curriculum wasn't sufficiently medieval.
- This wasn't the same Louis that I knew.
- Did he threaten you?
No, not per se, but there were voices raised.
So I'm thinking I'm the last guy that Louis would really take counsel from.
As I say, I wasn't afraid, but it was very uncomfortable.
How long ago was this?
Two... I guess since I've seen
Nell it's been two years.
Two years? They haven't come to church?
No. I heard about the home schooling.
I'm not one to sit here and say whether that's right or wrong, but Nell when she was here was a vibrant, happy girl.
And I just don't think to be cut off is the best thing for the child.
- Will you come out to the farm with me?
- If... OK, I'll tell you what.
You get Louis to agree for me to come to the farm and I'll be happy to do that.
I also can line up a good friend,
Psychiatric Head of
Department in Baton Rouge.
All right. I'm going to get back to the farm. Thank you, Pastor. Appreciate it.
Whoa. What's going on in there?
That doesn't look good.
She's fine! Get that damn camera off!
'Oh, God!'
- What happened?
- Caleb, you OK?
Can you write?
Here.
(Louis) Caleb? Caleb?
- He needs to go to a hospital.
- What happened?
He was trying to calm Nell down and she attacked him with a knife.
- She did this?
- Yes.
I gotta get him to the hospital.
- Yeah.
- Could you take him?
What if the demon comes back?
I need to be here for that.
You be well.
What did Caleb write?
"Don't leave her alone with him."
That's why I wanted to stay.
Nell?
Nell, honey? Can we come in?
Locked-in?
Hey, honey.
Are you kidding me?!
Find something. Help me get her out of that.
- I'm bad! I am, I'm bad!
- No, you're not. You're not bad.
Nell, you're not bad.
He'll be mad when he comes home!
I'm not gonna go to Heaven!
Honey, yes, you are.
You'll go to Heaven.
I remember hearing screaming and when I woke up his face was cut.
Does Caleb frighten you at all?
Does he hurt or tease you?
No, never Caleb.
Has your father ever hurt you?
No.
You can tell me.
No.
Let's put you back in the bed.
OK.
(Cotton) You hear that?
(Whispers) Is she sleepwalking?
I don't know.
Nell?
Honey, can you hear us?
Honey?
- Nell?
- Nell? Wake up. Nell!
Aaaaiee!
- It's OK. Right here.
- Giving your doll a bath. That's all.
Hey...
There we go.
There we go. It's all right, honey.
It's going to be OK.
Let's take her to the bed.
Well, you look better. I can see your eyes now.
Did you make this?
No!
This is what I got while we were in the bathroom.
I don't know how she'd know Latin.
- Maybe Louis taught her.
- Uh-uh. He doesn't know.
- So Nell's making those baby noises?
- Yeah.
What's going on?
(Answer machine) 'Hi, this is Dr Kyle.
'We just want to make sure that
Nell does not take the Halcion.
'The person that prescribed it did not know that she was pregnant.
'Give her Pepto-Bismol for her nausea, which is...'
This explains it. There you have it.
Underlying trauma!
You don't know who she's pregnant by.
- We're dealing with incest.
- You can't go saying that down here.
- It's there! It's obvious!
- Wait and talk to him is what we'll do.
- We need to take her and leave.
- That's kidnapping.
Keep exorcising her while her dad's raping her upstairs in the bedroom?!
- Can we take a break?
- What kind of break?
- We have to wait for him, no matter what.
- Fine.
- Guys, why don't we take a nap?
- OK, great(!)
Here, kitty, kitty.
Nell!
What are you doing?
- Good girl. Let go.
- Put the camera down.
- I'm sorry...
- Let's get some clothes on you.
- It seems to be all right.
- Guys! Take a look at this.
- Oh, my God.
- The same cat picture.
Wow. Look at this one.
Something's on fire. Maybe the house.
And look at this one.
- Is that me?
- Yes. It's all of us. All of us dead.
- I'm in the fire.
- I'm in a million pieces.
Danny, you get your head chopped off.
She's more messed up than I thought.
Not comfortable with what?
(Danny) Being with someone doing pictures of my head chopped off.
Relax. It's just a bunch of drawings.
She killed those animals and cut her brother up.
- You think she'll hack you to pieces?
- We've seen signs she's dangerous.
They're just drawings, Daniel. We're in the house and in her drawings.
She's a 16-year-old girl.
A girl and a psychopath are two different things.
She's not capable of chopping your head off.
- We should be concerned.
- We're all tired and here to help her.
Keep things in perspective.
(Danny) All right. Fine.
- You hear that?
- It sounds like there's two people.
Who were you talking to?
No one.
(Whispers) I swear there were two people in there.
'Just make sure that Nell does not take the Halcion.
'The person who prescribed it did not know she was pregnant.
'Give her Pepto-Bismol for her nausea, which is very common at this stage.
'Do not give her the Halcion.'
The book was right.
- The book was right?
- The book was right.
- What?
- The demon defiled my daughter.
My daughter is a virgin.
How did she get pregnant?
The book said it. You showed it to me.
I don't think the book has any bearing on this. It's more earthly matters now.
Reverend, I need you to perform another exorcism.
Get rid of that thing. I will not let it grow inside of her.
- I won't perform another exorcism.
- Reverend, I need you to help me.
- I need you to help Nell. Please.
- I don't think the demon did this.
I need you to do another exorcism.
I need you to do this.
What she needs is a doctor. I know this must be really hard to hear, but Nell's welfare is what we're all concerned with.
Right, Louis?
Reverend... if you can't save my daughter's soul,
I Will.
What are you talking about?
I would like you all to leave my property.
If you're not off it in 5 minutes, I will consider you all trespassers.
Louis... Louis, you need to be reasonable. Louis!
I bet he doesn't want to take her to a doctor.
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't want to wait. He'll hurt her.
(Danny) He's going to kill her. Death is the only salvation, you said.
- You're right. Just grab her and go.
- How are we going to do that?
Just take her and go.
What's he doing?
He's still praying. He's got a lot of guns in the house.
I know.
What happened?
Cotton, what is it?
Somebody upstairs.
- Nell?
- Nell?
I have a key here.
Hang on, Nell!
Nell!
Come on, honey.
It's us, come on.
There you go.
That's a good girl.
That's a good girl.
That's a good girl. Right here.
It's Cotton. It's Cotton.
You're all right. Come on.
That's a good girl. Good girl.
It's gonna be OK. Here you go.
That's it.
We're gonna go now. We're gonna get you in the car...
- Ow!
- Are you OK?
Nell!
Nell!
Nell, stop!
Nell?
- You OK?
- It's not that bad.
Nell?
Nell?
Here.
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.
The lights are on.
Louis is there.
- We'll get to the hotel, call the cops.
- Fine. Do you have the keys?
Yeah.
Cotton!
- Nell?
- No, can we please just go?
- Cotton?
- Come here. Come on.
Nell?
Cotton...
Nell, are you all right? Honey?
(Iris) Cotton...
Nell, look at me.
Can you look at me?
Aaaaargh!
Nell, no!
Stop! Stop!
- (Danny) You got it?
- Come on...
It's Louis!
- Go!
- Put the gun down, please! Please!
Lock the door! Lock the door!
Lock the door! Get away from the door!
Come here!
Come here!
- Let her go!
- No! You're going to kill her.
- Move away from her!
- Shoot me, Daddy!
Shoot me!
I was wrong. You were right. I'll do another exorcism. I'll do it.
I set out to save children and now I'm going to get her killed.
- What would you have said?
- I don't know.
It's a no win situation.
She admits she's pregnant - then what?
We'll all have a shotgun in our face.
What could a second exorcism possibly accomplish?
Hey, Nell.
I didn't get him out. I didn't get the demon out. It's my fault.
If you can be strong, I need you to do it one more time.
- Can you do that for me?
- I don't think I can.
I just need to see him one more time.
It's not that I don't think I can, it's just that. - - I don't know how to do it. It just comes voluntarily.
L-I don't have any control over what happens to me.
I think you could.
I think if you want to.
- I wanted to get better last time.
- I know, I know.
I really wanted it. I couldn't want it any more than last time.
I know.
I failed you that time, but this time I won't.
This time I won't, I promise.
I need you to... I need you to be willing to bring him up again.
I think you can do it.
I think...
I think if you just allow yourself, I think you can do it.
- Nell, can you hear me?
- Y-Yeah.
All right. I'm right here.
I feel like I'm falling a lot.
OK, well, you're right here.
I got you right here.
- It's getting hard to see you.
- OK.
Here we go. I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere, honey. Right here.
- What is that?
- Hm? There's nothing there.
- What is it?
- There's nothing there. I'm right here.
- What? Please, help! It's coming.
- Let him come.
- Let him come now.
- He's coming through my skin!
- Get him out of my skin!
- It's OK.
I'm right here, Nell.
(Iris) Oh, my God! Oh, my God...
Nell?
Nell...
(Louis) He has her!
Nell, can you hear me?
Nell?
Reverend Marcus.
I hear you don't believe in me.
Who are you?
Abalam.
Where's Nell?
In the fire.
She's been there for some time.
Soon you'll join her.
Don't believe the demon's lies, Louis.
A demon's lies?
If I invoke the name of Jesus Christ our
Saviour, you shall leave this girl!
If I beseech our
Lord and invoke Him and put on the whole armour of God that He may withstand the Devil, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the rules of darkness!
Words! Words! Words!
I'll tell you what. If you can keep quiet for 10 seconds,
I'll let the girl go.
(Louis) Yes...
Agreed.
One! Aaaargh!
- Two! Aaargh!
- Nell!
- Three!
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Honey... Honey, stop.
- You lose!
- Louis, I'm sorry...
- Do something!
I'll do something, Daddy. Reverend, how about a blowing job?
Nell!
What did you say?
What's a blowing job?
Tell me what that is.
You don't know, do you?
You don't even know that is not what it's called. You are not a demon.
A demon would know what that is, but maybe not a home-schooled girl.
I don't think you're a demon.
You're an innocent girl.
- I think you're a little innocent girl!
- Aaaaaah!
- I think you're an innocent girl!
- No-o-o!
- You're not a demon at all!
- She isn't innocent!
She isn't innocent.
She isn't innocent!
It's OK. Let it out.
It's all right.
Turn that off.
She isn't innocent!
It's OK. Turn it off!
Turn it off!
- She looks like she's resting.
- She is relieved and resting really well.
- Praise God.
- Do you know a boy named Logan?
- No.
- He works in a café or...
- ls Abalam gone?
- Your daughter doesn't have a demon.
Your daughter is suffering from shame.
Nell is pregnant. The father is Logan.
No, sir, that's impossible.
- Louis, if Nell says that's what ha...
- Delirious! Look what she went through.
- Look what she went through!
- Listen to her yourself, OK?
You'll see the truth that she has.
A couple of years ago when her mom was dying, he came by and asked if she wanted to go for a ride in his car. He was driving a sports car.
It was old, but still a sports car.
And she got in it and he started driving out to a field.
Then he turned to her and he asked her if she wanted to have sex.
And she said, "Yes."
She asked him, "Am I pretty?"
And he said, "Yes."
He said, "I think you're so pretty."
- Then he took her...
- Stop it!
You were raped!
- You were raped!
- She said, "Yes." She liked it.
That's enough, honey.
She's right about one thing, Reverend.
There is a boy that works at that café.
I've no idea what his name is, but for all I know he could be Logan.
'Pastor Manley?'
Reverend Cotton Marcus calling.
Could you please call me back?
I'm at the Sweetzer farm.
- Pastor Manley, thank you so much.
- A pleasure.
Good to see you. Welcome.
- Don't forget to smile.
- Hello.
Louis is upstairs with Nell.
- She admitted Logan impregnated her.
- Logan?
- He works at the café down the road.
- Mm-hm. I know him.
Frankly, Pastor, I don't know what more I can do for them.
Is Louis on board with psychological help from my friend in Baton Rouge?
- I think Louis would be amenable to that.
- I'll call him first thing.
Louis. It's been too long.
- Thank you for coming, sir.
- My pleasure.
- I'm Louis.
- Becky.
Hi.
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you.
I cried out to you, O, Lord.
You are my refuge.
Please attend to my cry.
Please attend to this child for Thou art stronger than any possible thing that could attack your servant.
Bring this child's soul out of prison...
I'd be lying if I said I was sure of everything I did when it came to that.
I've never seen anything like that.
Poor Nell.
She's going to have to get some serious help.
Louis could use some as well!
Hey, what was the name of that café that boy worked at? Riche's, right?
Hi. How you doing?
'She's lying!'
I'm not the father of her child.
At all. I don't even know the girl.
We met once at Pastor Manley's party.
We were both there and she saw me and talked to me for maybe a minute.
- At Pastor Manley's house?
- Yes.
- Last summer?
- Yes.
- Sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
I didn't get her pregnant, though.
And another thing. I don't...
She's nice and everything, but
I'm not exactly interested in...
You know?
- Girls.
- Right.
So she's lying.
The Pastor said he hadn't seen her in three years.
- He's lying. And the kid's obviously gay.
- Yeah.
- Why would she lie to us?
- To get rid of us? Get us out?
Yeah, but why?
What are you doing?
I'm turning around.
- Going back to the house?
- Yeah.
Louis!
- (Knocks)
- Louis!
Oh, my God.
The phones have been ripped out.
Ssh.
(Whispers) Do you hear that?
What?
Cotton? Cotton!
Cotton, listen to me.
- Cotton, please...
- Ssh!
- This is insane.
- We need to find Nell.
- (Danny) She's got a point, Cotton.
- Ssh!
Turn off that light.
That's Nell, right there on the table!
- Is that Louis?
- It is.
Is he tied up? We should get the police.
- I want to get out of here.
- Wait. Wait.
It's Pastor Manley.
That's Pastor Manley!
(Iris) Is he leading the thing?
- We've got to get help right now.
- What are they doing...?
That isn't human!
(Manley) Hail, Abalam!
We've got to get out of here!
We've got to go!
I want to get out of here!
Right now!
We gotta go! We gotta go!
Cotton, what are you doing?
Cotton!
Demon, you cannot have the soul of this girl for she is a creature of God!
(Man) The one with the camera!
Get him!
They're coming! Run! Run!
Go! Go! Go!
Come back! Come back!
- No!
- Let go of me!
Caleb! Aargh!
Man: l must've-
I must've dozed off or something. l apologize. Watch your head.
Watch your- I'm sorry.
Ready, one, two, let's go.
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.
Just relax.
Hi guys. My name's Craig.
I'm an aIcohoIic.
Group: Hi Craig.
Today is my five-year anniversary.
That's five years of sobriety.
Um, you know,
I know a few of you are just getting started with this thing. l just wanted you to know it does get easier. lt never ends.
Uord knows it never ends.
But if you stick with it, it does get easier.
And believe me, if I can do it, then so can you.
That's all l wanted to say.
Thank you, Craig.
And congratulations again.
On that note, I think there's someone else here who has an anniversary that they need to celebrate today.
Am I right?
Sarah?
Oh, um... hi.
I'm Sarah.
And I'm an aIcohoIic.
Group: Hi Sarah.
This isn't- it's not really as big a deal as Craig's. lt's just l'm three months today.
Sarah, is there anything eIse you'd Iike to say?
No, that's all.
No? Okay, weII, unless anyone else has anything they'd Iike to share, l guess we're done here.
Okay.
Group: Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things
I cannot change, the courage to change the things that I can and the wisdom to know the difference, living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time, accepting hardships as a pathway to peace.
Amen.
Thank you.
Shit.
- Hey Sarah.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Kevin.
- Yeah, Kevin.
- Kev-
That's right. l just wanted to come say congratuIations. lt's a really big deal.
You should be proud of yourseIf.

Um, and l was thinking maybe if you wanted to go ceIebrate it would be my treat. l could take you out or-
Uh, not tonight.
That's all right.
You've got plans.
On the couch- a movie.
Fair enough.
AII right, get home safe.
Thanks.
- Yeah, l'll see you next time.
- Okay.
All right, congratulations.
It's reaIIy cooI.
Thank you.
Uh, l could- l could do, like, Thursday lunch.
Do you Iike ItaIian food?
Yeah.
All right, there's a great pIace right across the street from my office.
Uet's do that.
It's caIled D'Amato's.
Okay, see you then.
Good.
Okay, drive safe.
Stay warm.

Your tongue- move it around.
Show me your armpits.
Lift your nutsack.

Turn around.
All right, get dressed.

Well, you look great.

Yeah. You too. l like that sweater.

Would you like to make a drink order whiIe you Iook at the menu?
Kevin:
No? l'lI have a Coke, pIease.
Waitress:
Okay. And for you, ma'am?
I'm fine with water.
Thank you.
- Okay, I'II be right back with that.
- Thanks.
StiII a weird question, huh?
"WouId you Iike a drink?"
Yes, l would. l mean, it doesn't really help that there's wine bottles surrounding us. l know.
I didn't reaIize... until l walked in.
Do you want to go somewhere else?
It's not too Iate.
No, l'm- no, don't worry about me.
Okay, are you sure?
I mean, there's a Iot of good pIaces even just right on this street.
No, it's- no.
I was- l was kind of joking.
Kevin: Um, garcon, have these removed, please.
Orjust put bIankets over them.
That's-
Can we put some nice French posters around the wall, something Iike that?
Yeah, l just used to order a beer, you know? l would just say,
"Oh, I'm not gonna drink it. l'll just order it and I'II feeI Iike an aduIt. lt can just sit there."
Sarah:
Such a bad idea. lt's a terrible idea.
It never works. l'm sure that- that it took about five minutes before you downed it.
Yeah, that sounds right.
- Do you know what you want?
- I have no idea.
Kevin: Mm. Well, it's all pretty good.
- CIerk: Hey, how's it going?
- Good, man. How are you?
CIerk: Good.
That'lI be $30 even.
All right.
What's the deal with the showers?
It's five bucks for 30 minutes. l'll take an hour.
All right.
Can I get you a bag for these?
No no, l'm fine.
Uet's get you in stall 7, right upstairs.
All right.
Do you need, like, soap or shampoo? l've got it in the bag.
Thanks.
It's through here? Up?
- Yeah, it's just up the stairs.
- Thanks.
Sarah: Okay, I'm just gonna put this around your neck, aII right?
Lift your head for me.
Woman:
So how was yesterday?
You feeI aII right?
You mean my date?
Is that what you're asking me?
Yes, l mean your date.
He's great. l mean, it was really- it was realIy- reaIIy surface IeveI, so...
Woman:
WeIl, this might be a good distraction right now, you know?
Sarah:
You know, he's reaIIy nice.
I just don't feeI Iike
I'm ready for... something like that.
Well, give it time.
Don't, you know- don't write it off yet.
Woman:
Are you scared?
A little, yeah. l'm probably just being paranoid though. l don't know.
I think that's pretty naturaI.
Male TV anchor:
Home saIes here in the Midwest- numbers show a huge drop in overaII saIes from December.
SaIes feII 37%/% in January, but they were stiII up 4%/% in 2009 as compared to 2008.
Recapping our top story this evening, the manhunt continues tonight for Garrick Turrell, who remains at large after escaping from poIice custody.
The search, which is now in its fifth day, has Iaw enforcement agencies across the country coordinating their efforts.
Prison warden CIarkton Smith, whose facility housed TurreIl, issued a statement to the press this afternoon addressing the difficuIty in Iocating the notorious seriaI kiIIer who may have been taken in and housed by his purported fans.
Smith:
Yes, that is correct.
Garrick TurreII during his time in custody here did receive more Ietters than any previous resident we've had incarcerated, and by a considerable number.
And yes, that apparently includes severaI marriage proposaIs.
Sarah:
This is me right here.
- Kevin: lt's a cool place.
- Sarah: Thank you.
Kevin: Got the whoIe thing to yourseIf or do you have roommates?
Sarah:
It's just me.
Kevin:
That's pretty nice.
- Kevin: l had a really good time.
- Me too.
Kevin:
Yeah, it was fun.
Oh, we're fogging up the windows.
Kevin:
See you soon?
Sarah:
Yeah. Yeah, let's-
Kevin:
Maybe this weekend? I don't-
- Sarah: Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
- AIl right, sure.
Sarah: Let me caII you tomorrow just to make sure.
- Kevin: No pressure. All right, good.
- Okay. Okay.
- Sarah: I'II see you sometime.
- Yeah, taIk to you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Woman on TV:
ExactIy as I dreamed it.
Or did I?
Maybe this is the dream.
Man on TV:
It's pretty weird.
Have you had enough?
If you're tired, we can go back.
Woman on TV: No.
We go on this way.
Sarah: No. l'm mad at you.
- Garrick: I missed you.
- No.
- l did.
- You didn't.
Sarah:
Where were you?
Garrick:
I told you. l had that dinner meeting with Mark and TK to talk about their college bankroII stuff and-
Yeah, and then where did you go?
'Cause it's Iike 11:00.
Garrick: Where?
We were there Iate.
Oh, but wait.
No, we went to the strip club first.
Sarah: That's not- that's not funny at aIl.
- lt's a littIe funny.
- I don't Iike it.
- l like you.
- l don't like thosejokes.
They're jokes.
Garrick: Here.
- l Iove you.
- l Iove you.
Fuck.
Male radio anchor:
...related to the escape of the aIIeged seriaI kiIler
Garrick TurreII.
An FBl spokesman wouId onIy say that certain detaiIs of the murder, which they were unabIe to disclose, linked the killings with patterns estabIished in Turrell's alleged slayings, aIl of which took pIace in Alabama and Mississippi over the past five years.
The disturbing news for law enforcement is that the search for TurreII has not yet spread as far north as Kansas, indicating that the escaped suspect may have somehow evaded poIice checkpoints.
The FBl states that the search for Turrell, now in its seventh day, is being expanded to include the entire Midwest, with local agencies coordinating their efforts.
DetaiIed images of TurreII are being circuIated to checkpoints along the Mexican and Canadian borders.
Woman:
The first time I drank l think l was eight years old, but l don't really remember.
The first time I got drunk
I was nine. l do remember that.
But, l don't know, the weird thing now is that l've been sober for aImost a year and now my friends are all on the drinking thing and are going to parties around town.
And they don't understand why I don't want to go with them.
And, l don't know, sometimes
I aImost feeI robbed of something, you know, of some experience that l should have had or should have enjoyed.
But, l don't know, l guess it doesn't really matter.
So that's it.
Sarah, I was just wondering if you wanted to telI us what made you decide to finaIIy confront your iIIness.
Uh... l was... in a pretty bad relationship.
He was... not very honest with me about a Iot of things.
After l... found out that- well, that- that- after I found out... l realized... that l had been... drinking a lot, that maybe it wouldn't have happened- no, l'm- not that it- nothing- that maybe it wouldn't have been as bad if I hadn't been drunk all the time.
So I- after I moved here l... uh, started coming to meetings.
And it's been reaIIy good for me.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How are you feeIing?
- Er...
That was reaIIy great.
What?
Just everything you said in group was reaIly- was really vulnerable and great. lt's really good that you could do that. l think everybody appreciated it.
Yeah, there's a lot more to that story that l should-
- Yeah, l'm sure.
- Yeah.
There's a lot more to my story too and everybody eIse's, but l think you said what you had to say and, um... l should probably tell you about it though. l mean, l should- it's pretty... bad.
Good. Someday you can teII me about it, okay?
Not right now. l really like you.
I reaIIy- l like hanging out with you.
And l want to hear that story and all your other stories, you know?
But I don't want you to feeI Iike you have to teII them to me.
Anyway, whatever.
I shouId get going.
But l'll see you on Wednesday, right?
Do you want to come over right now?
Come over to your pIace?
Yeah.
Yeah, we c- yeah.
Yeah.
We'll have tea or something.
If you think it's a good idea. l mean, tea sounds great.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
All right, well,
I'II meet you over there, okay?
All right.
See you soon.
No! No! No!
It's okay?
Do you have a condom? l think l have one in the nightstand.
You want me to get it?
Do you want me to put it on?
Kevin: Yeah.
Kevin:
Are you sure?
Are you sure it's okay?
Sarah: Yeah.
Hold on. Hold on.
Oh shit. HoId on.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
No. No.
Are you okay? l'm sorry.
Fuck.
- lt's okay.
- I'm sorry. lt's okay.
Garrick:
When we get up to him, he's probably gonna ask you for your driver's license.
Just give it to him.
It's not a big deaI.
- How are you foIks doing today?
- Garrick: Good. How are you?
- Good. Sorry for the inconvenience.
- It's no problem.
- Where are you foIks coming from today?
- Coming from the airport actuaIIy.
- Okay. Where are you fIying in from?
- I'm fIying from Atlanta today.
- Okay. And what's your business here?

Here you go.
Thanks.
You said you just needed me to get through the roadblock and then you would let me go. l know. l will.
Yeah, Ieft here.
Where are we going? l'm still trying to figure that out.
My famiIy was expecting me at home a half-hour ago.
If l Ieave you here, the cops will be on me before I can ditch this car and find another one.
It's fine.
There's nothing to worry about. l just want to get up the road a IittIe bit further before l Iet you go. l won't talk to the cops. l just want to see my family again.
You said you weren't gonna hurt me.
You said that you were gonna let me go. PIease just-
What the fuck is wrong with you? l'm not gonna hurt you. l'm just trying to think. l just want to get up the road a Iittle ways.
I'II drop you off, okay?
Take it easy.

Yeah, here. PulI off.
Put the car in park.
Park it.
Sarah:
What are you doing?
Oh hey. l'm sorry.
I couIdn't sIeep. l thought l'd put some clothes on and take a walk or a drive or something.
You know me.
I'm weird. lt's really late, sweetie.
Yeah, l know.
What are you doing up?
Are you doing okay?
Sarah:
No, my head reaIly hurts.
I was gonna get a drink of water or something.
Garrick: That's a good idea.
You shouId drink some water.
You know, you should get something to eat too.
- Sarah: Yeah.
- Some bread or a pretzeI or something.
- That's probably a good idea.
- Yeah.
Sarah: You don't want to come back to bed with me?
Oh, come on.
Of course I do.
I just feIt Iike
I was keeping you up.
- You want to take a waIk with me?
- Uh-uh.

- l love you.
I'II see you soon, baby, okay?
Lock this door behind me, okay?
- Hi.
- Kevin: Hey, good morning. l didn't know you were still here.
Welcome to the world of the waking.
- How are you doing?
- Good.
I made coffee.
Oh, thanks.
I wouId have made breakfast, but you don't have any food.
Yeah, l haven't been grocery shopping in a while.
- You hungry?
- A IittIe.
- Want to go get some food?
- Sure.
Want coffee?
Um, yeah, l'll have- sure, yeah. l'm just gonna brush my teeth real quick.
Kevin: All right.
I used your toothbrush. l hope that's okay.
Yeah, that's fine.
- ReaIIy?
- Mm-hmm. l didn't really use your toothbrush.
You can if you want.
No, l was just kidding.
Okay. l brought my own.
Okay.
- That was also a joke.
- Okay. l'll be back.
I'II be there in a second.
Kevin: All right.
Whoa.
Man:
Hey man.
- What?
- You need to be carefuI.
Huh?
See these power Iines?
Yeah.
They got transponders in them.
You know what a transponder is?
Garrick: I do.
Well, they put them in back when it was built in the '50s for the commies.
They never had to use them though.
But this nigger president in the White House- he wants to keep track of us out here
- with them- using them...
- Garrick: Right.
...you know, to keep track of our thoughts.
You know, driving a car like you're driving- with that pIastic roof- they can read right through that.
Now what you need- a steeI roof.
- Yeah?
- They can't read through that.
They can't.
So you need to get yourseIf one of these.
I'm gonna go, aII right?
Well, l thought
I'd just pass the word.
Thank you.
Good looking out.
- You be good now.
- AlI right, drive safeIy.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Kevin: ls there a university in JacksonvilIe, a coIIege?
Sarah:
University of Northern FIorida.
Kevin: I'm trying to think of what the sports team is. l'm sure there's, what, minor Ieague basebaII?
- Sarah: I don't reaIIy keep up with sports.
- Spring training?
Well, there's Jacksonville Jaguars- footbaII. l'm sure your mom sees
Iots of Jaguars games.
No, she doesn't really do anything, but-
- ReaIIy?
- No.
She's not a season ticket hoIder?
No, just work, home, television.
How's it going, Kevin? lt's going good, Rusty.
How are you doing, paI? l'm doing good, man.
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- I'm Sarah. I'm sorry.
- Kevin: Sorry. Sarah- Rusty.
- Hi, Rusty.
- Here you are.
- Reed.
- Reed. Oh, thank you.
- Kevin: Do you want anything eIse?
- No, l'm fine.
Would you two like to order something?
Yeah, baby. l would love a strong cup of coffee.
Great.
Rusty: l never see you outside of work, man.
Kevin:
Busy guy.
Rusty:
Ain't we aII?
So is this here why you never come out drinking with us?
If I had a pretty young Iady Iike this, l'd never leave my house, man.
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie. l'm gonna leave you two alone, aIl right?
Come on, Reed, Iet's go.
See you at work, man. lt was nice meeting you.
Nice guys, right?
Yeah.
You work with them? l do.
They're old drinking buddies.
Mm.
He smeIIs Iike Iiquor.
That's pretty normal.
Easier just to avoid them these days than... trying to explain the idea of sobriety, which l don't think their brains can fulIy process, you know?
Sarah:
I understand that.
- Hi Sarah.
- Hi. Sorry I'm Iate.
Hey. Hey. Do you know where CarIa is?
No. She didn't come in?
No. She didn't show up this morning.
She didn't caII in either or anything.
Dr. Belton's pretty pissed about it.
That's weird.
Yeah. Uook, if you taIk to her, will you just tell her to get the heII in here?
Sure thing.
Hey girl.
Just wondering where you are.
You're supposed to be at work.
Everyone's a little pissed.
Okay, just caII me back when you get this.
Bye.
What can I get you?
- Are you guys stilI serving food?
- Yeah.
- You got steak?
- Sure.
And a soda, please.
Female radio anchor:
FBI agents involved in a manhunt for a suspected seriaI kiIler
Garrick TurreII have asked members of the pubIic to come forward if they have any information that might
Iead to the capture of the suspect who escaped from state custody on Tuesday.
It was specificaIIy noted that citizens shouId come forward if they might have knowIedge of anyone aiding the aIleged killer in his escape.
An FBl spokesman noted that Turrell, who is thought to have already traveled beyond police roadblocks, has severaI fansites on the internet dedicated to him and a Facebook fan page with membership in the hundreds of thousands.
WhiIe some of this is no doubt intended as galIows humor, it remains a reaIity at least three Turrell copycat slayings are currentIy under investigation...
A shortcut.
Anchor:...assistance in continuing to evade custody.
Anyone with knowledge or suspected knowIedge of any such activity is asked to contact their local
Iaw enforcement agency immediately.
Oh, wait wait.
I'Il be right back.
Hey.
Hey man.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, what-?
Excuse me.
You're CarIa's IandIord, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, have you seen her today?
Not today. l guess the last time l saw her was the day before yesterday.
Okay. CouId you just- if you see her, couId you teII her that her friend from work is looking for her?
Sure.
What's your name again?
Sarah.
Just teII her to caII me if you-
No problem.
- There you go.
- Kevin: Mm, thanks.
Yeah.
- Want some of this?
- No.
Sure? lt's reaIIy good. l'm sorry.
I'm distracted.
My- my friend didn't show up for work.
And l tried calling her.
- Which friend?
- CarIa. l went by her house and she wasn't there.
She's- it's just-
Kevin: Do you want to talk to the police?
We can go in there after group and just talk to them for a second.
Maybe somebody's heard something.
Sarah:
She's probabIy fine.
I'm feeIing kind of weird today. l guess you guys probably heard about the murders Iast night.
Woman: No.
No?
Okay, weII, Smitty's- that bar on old 63- there was a couple mur- a coupIe guys got murdered.
They got stabbed to death in the parking lot.
And l'm sure it'll be on the locaI news tonight.
But l guess the deal was they said their waIlets were missing so it must have been a mugging gone bad or something.
But, l don't know, one of the guys was a meth cooker, or had been a meth cooker, so that might have had something to do with it.
Man, the thing is though, like,
Smitty's used to be one of my bars.
And l knew those guys, you know. l used to drink with them back in the day.
And just seeing that, hearing about it kind of got me thinking, you know, that couId have been me.
Uike, l could have been hanging out with them tonight or the night before.
And, you know, whatever happened to them- that could have happened to me too. l don't know.
So it just kind of put everything in this kind of focus for me, like nothing good ever comes of drinking, you know, really, like not ever.
So I guess I'm just happy to be on the, you know, sober path, not the devil's path.
Ueader:
Thank you, Werner.
Ueader: All right, with that,
Iet's have a littIe prayer.
Group:
Uord, grant me the serenity to accept the things
I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time, accepting hardships as a pathway to peace.
Amen.
CarIa.
CarIa, are you in there? lt's me- Mr. Harper.
If you can hear me, l'm coming in now.
CarIa.
Oh shit.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Oh shit. l'm so sorry. l came as soon as I got your message.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- l know who kiIled CarIa.
- What?
- I know who kiIIed CarIa.
- What? They caught the person?
No, it's my ex-boyfriend.
He's gonna kiII-
What?
Your ex-boyfriend?
No one's supposed to know who l am.
The FBI- that's why l'm here.
- l'm sorry.
- What are you taIking about?
The FBl- that's why l'm-
- Kevin: What?
- He's gonna kilI me.
We have to get out of here.
He's coming after me.
- He knows where you live?
- No, you don't understand.
He'll kill you too. l'm sorry.
I didn't know who to caII.
- l'm so sorry. l'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- l don't know where to go.
- HoId on a second.
All right, my parents have a pIace- a cabin, okay?
Nobody is gonna be able to find us.
- AII right?
- Okay.
If we go and spend the night there, are you gonna feeI better?
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
Uet me just call them and make sure we can do this.
Okay okay.
All right, go put some clothes in a bag, okay?
Okay.
I'II be right here, okay?
PoIiceman: Ma'am, we have to find the owner of this storage shed. l don't know who owns it. l toId you Garrick- he was here, but he doesn't own it.
Ma'am, have you seen exactly what's in there?
Then you have to tell us where he is.
He's- he doesn't- he's working in an office on 29 Crescent.
He doesn't have anything to do with it though.
Send armed units to 29 Crescent Street-
Garrick TurreII.
Sarah: I just wanted to pretend like it didn't happen.
You know, l remember when all this went down. l remember reading about it in the papers.
And l didn't read your name.
I never read about you.
Sarah: It's part of my deal for testifying against him.
- lt's part of your deaI?
- Yeah.
What, are you in witness protection?
Sarah:
Supposed to be.
How did they keep that out of the papers?
It's pretty high-profiIe.
Kevin:
Never mind.
Look, we're almost there, okay?
AII right, wait here for a sec.
Grab your bag, 'cause we're gonna have to waIk the rest of the way.
We have to turn on the electricity.
All right.
Come in.
What the fuck are you boys doing here?
You're seriously gonna keep going with that bulIshit?
What, are you using this as your vacation house, Rusty?
All right, man.
Look, I'm tired of waiting. lt's time to get down to business.
- What are you taIking about?
- Yeah, aII right.
- Garrick: Sarah, are you awake?
- Sarah: Yeah.
- Garrick: Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Garrick: Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
Garrick: It's kind of a messed up question.
Okay.
If you were gonna die and you knew you were gonna die and you couId choose how, what wouId you choose?
Sarah: Uh... morphine overdose.
That'd be-
I think that'd be nice.
- Garrick: ReaIIy?
- Yeah.
- That seems kind of weak.
- Weak?
Garrick:
Yeah, it's kind of pussy.
Sarah: It's not.
You just asked me if l wanted to die.
Sarah:
WeIl, how would you want to die?
- Garrick: How do l want to die?
- Yeah.
Something reaIly hardcore.
Like what? l don't know.
Like... kamikaze pilot.
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.
Sarah:
No, you wouldn't.
- Garrick: Good night.
- Yeah.
She's awake.
- Sarah: Kevin.
- Rusty: It's about time.
Kevin.
You want me to give her something so she won't pass out?
Sarah: Kevin, pIease pIease.
PIease Iet me go.
Kevin:
Like what?
Rusty: l don't know.
Like some crank or something.
- Do you have any crank?
- Kevin, pIease.
Rusty:
No, but I can get some.
Please, Kevin, please.
- What are you doing?
- What?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- l'm gonna have some fun with this one.
- No no.
She's way hotter than that coworker skanky bitch that Reed fucked up.
Kevin, l don't know why you had to fuck her poor face up.
She was pretty good-Iooking before that.
Just roII her over and fuck her in the ass.
From the mouths of babes.
- Kevin: Nobody's gonna fuck her, okay?
- Reed: That's what I wouId do.
- Kevin: Nobody's gonna fuck her.
- What? And why not? lt's like we get a girl in the room and you guys forget why we're here.
This is the bitch that put Garrick TurreII behind bars-
Sarah: No.
-the greatest killer of our generation and my own personal goddamn fucking hero.
After aII the fucking time we put in trying to find her, all the time on the site, we're finaIIy here, guys.
- How wouId Garrick do it?
- Sarah: PIease.
- Reed: The feet.
- Kevin: Mm-hmm. Why?
- Breaks the spirit.
- Are you Iistening?
If you hurt their feet, they can't run away.
So even if she manages to escape,
- she knows she's not going anywhere.
- PIease.
'Cause how can you run when you can't even walk?
- Please please.
- Shh, he's taIking. Shh.
Kevin.
Sarah: No no no!
Kevin: Yeah, Reed.
Yeah yeah, shut her up.
Shut her up.
Shh. Shh shh.
Shh.
Come on.
Shh shh.
Come on, Reed, shut her up.
Reed:
You want to do it?
Who the fuck is that?
Shh.
You two just need to caIm down.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.
Hey man, thanks for having me, sincerely.
Garrick.
Was it you who sent me aII those Ietters?
Well, we all sent you letters.
- l told you how to get here.
- Ah.
He sent me a code so that l couId find you.
Made sense to me. l mean,
I knew you had a friend Iiving here.
That was very clever.
- Thank you.
- No one eIse saw that.
Reed: l really appreciate that.
Thank you.
Yeah. l am a bit curious though, um, about what exactly it is you're doing to her there.
Hmm?
Finishing your work.
- My work?
- Yeah, man.
We're gonna kill the bitch who put you away.
She's the reason you got caught.
We're just trying to fucking heIp you out.
Why would l want to kiII her?
'Cause it's- it's her fauIt.
Yes. Yeah.
Our reIationship- mine and Sarah's- was based on a mutuaI understanding and trust- trust that l'd be a normal man and that we'd have a happy, normal relationship together.
ClearIy I- I fucked that up.
I don't bIame Sarah...
...for caIIing the poIice when she found out I couId never give her that.
And fuck,
God knows I'd do the same thing if l was in her position.
Besides, l liked it in prison.
Rusty:
Okay, he's fucking with us.
- Have you ever been to prison?
- Yeah.
Yeah? Okay, weII, then you know how hard it is to hurt somebody in there, especiaIIy if you're in soIitary confinement, which l was.
You know, no weapons, guards, cameras everywhere.
Everyone's aware of their own space.
Reed: And why wouId you Iike that? l was happy there. l was calm.
You know- you know what?
This is the truth-
I'd have never Ieft there if it wasn't for aII those Ietters from you assholes.
You don't understand what I mean, do you?
- No, l don't.
- Okay. Okay. l can make it clear. l just need an example.
Can I see your gun for a minute?
Are you fucking kidding me?
No, man, just for a second. l'lI give it right back.
Rusty, just give him the gun.
Huh-uh.
Are you fucking crazy, Reed?
No, look, if it makes you feel more safe, take the bullets out before you give it to me.
This is my fucking gun.
Nobody's getting it but me, man.
That's fine.
That works too.
- Reed: You motherfucker!
- Nol
Sarah: No! No!
Garrick, I'm so sorry.
Garrick, I didn't mean anything by it.
You're my hero.
Baby, you gotta untie me.
CouId you, pIease?
PIease.
Please.
- l know.
- Could you? Could you?
CouId you?
Come on. Come on.
Baby, baby, baby.

Garrick:
Hey. Hey.
Sarah:

No, you must remain seated.
Please, sir.
Flies a drug addict.
He's back.
- Roger.
The girls get all the pleasure.
- Definitely.
Please continue to sit down, sir.
Sir...
- You do not understand.
Fantastic. Now we are all sick.
- Relax, it happens all the time.
And if it is influenza?
- Then we complain to.
Anyway.
- Let me off!
Sir, sit if we mask.
Get clean and come back.
Go on, Jenny.
Forward.
Sir, sit still.
Just breathe.
I know it's uncomfortable.
You're all right.
Sir!
Stop!
Let me out! Land "the plane!
Let me inside.
- Lead the plane.
Land the plane.
Good heavens!
Let me inside.
Foam is coming out of his mouth.
He is crazy.
George.
LA, this is flight 318.
We have a code red emergency.
Go help.
We have a name.
- We have to get there.
The cockpit is not at risk.
Put the door.
Sit down.
Jenny, take the lead.
Bind his wrists together.
Confirmed, this is LA.
- Do you have a name?
Grab his arms. Come on.
Hit him again.
I 'm
Gotcha.
They got him down.
He's stuck.
That happens all the time, right?
What is the name of the passenger?
Ralph Bundt.
Bundt.
Well.
Thanks.
Do you feel nauseous if you want to puke?
- It's fine.
You had a concussion.
You must be investigated.
I'm so sorry.
- Take me to this plane.
Are you a doctor?
- Medical.
Get some ice for the bump and when he starts to behave weird or sleepy...
I understand t.
I love him with new eye.
Thank you.
He's asleep.
I panicked. I was useless.
I did nothing right.
It does not.
You did your best.
It's done. It's over.
Come here.
The captain.
A passenger must be provided immediately.
Everyone sits down with his belt.
With Paula.

They want us now countries.
We have bad weather.
Ladies and gentlemen, we introduce an immediate emergency landing out.

Lean forward.
Hands on your head.
Elbows against your thighs.
Here we go.
Hold on.

Is he conscious?
Not yet.
On three.
One, two, three.
It does not fit.
- I'll get his extension.
Hurry.
Goodness.
Put down your back.
We're about countries.
Air traffic control, I need permission.
What's taking so long?
Air Traffic Control.
- Hold him there.
Damn.
Keep the door to.
Where is your medical kit?
Fast.
Her head.
Keep applying pressure.
What? Only two doses of lidocaine?
What is that?
- Anesthesia.
So they do not go into shock for she 's hospital.
Give me your scarf.
Hold on.
Hold on.
- They bleed empty.
Keep pressure on the wound.
Come on.
We caught a violent man.
And you say me waiting?
- Why are we silent?
The tower does not have access.
- Why not?
Tell us.
- Captain.
What do we do?
- Hold your position.
We can not wait.
- We must do something.
Willsy, take us to the gate.
Captain, what happens?
87 is the closest.
- I take gate 87.
I need medical assistance.
Let us wait there.
Trunk that aircraft should operate.
Air Traffic Control.
- Right for us.
He sees us.
You have it ruined, lady.
Wrong gate and airport.
TSA needs to Terminal A.
- Evacuate.
Quick!
We need help.
Get them out of the plane.
Get them out of the plane.
What happens?
Wait.
Open gate 87.
I have an injured flight...
TSA 318.
Answer, I need help.
- Why do not they answer?
Do fucking open.
- Tell them to open.
Calm.
Everyone, stay calm.
This woman must be immediately to 's hospital.
Wait.
How do we get out here?
Damn.
Keep the door open for me.
Hurry.
What are you doing here?
- The gate is closed.
We go through the passenger leave out another way.
What about...
- He was exhausted.
We have it under control.
Bring the passengers to safety and then come back with help.
Jenny, come on.
Departure.
Come on.
Where are we?
- Above the cargo space.
Where all things are done that you will never see.
How's your head?
Good work on that plane.
- Thanks.
Where is everybody?
- Everything is abandoned.
This terminal is offline for three hours.
Closed for maintenance.
We need her down the stairs, bring to the hangar.
You help me. Forward.
Quiet, okay? On three.
One, two, three.
That door leads to the main terminal.
That has never been locked.
Do not have keys or something?
- It works here automatically.
They have us in lockdown.
Lockdown?
- What?
Ever heard of terrorism?
Since 9 / 11 changed that.
Super Secure.
Each entrance is guarded and off.
They look at us.
Why we are in lockdown?
- You tell me that.
What is this?
- This is not good.
What are you doing?
You work here...
- Answer. There must be something.
You have to find something, man.
- Silence.
I wave my badge at people.
- Wait.
You hold us up.
- Silence.
The police.
Be careful.
Why sirens?
Attention, flight 318.
Try not to leave the terminal.
Help is on the road.
You are now in quarantine.
Everything goes wrong.
I do not know what to say to them.
We're stuck.
Dad, call me as soon as possible.
Tell me what to do.
Have you called your parents?
They make you wonder.
That's what I do.
Come here.
I just called to 911.
They know nothing of.
What? I do not understand.
What do you earn?
- Nothing.
What is this?
What do they do?
Why expose us so?
How long will this take?
I got a job interview.
My husband waiting for me at the airport.
I'm my sister's wedding r missing.
Do you get the captain.
Someone must take the lead.
I understand that.
- We need info.
My wife is six months pregnant.
- How old are you anyway?
Sorry, I...
- You're not good enough.
Take it easy.
- You gotta right not to keep us here.
She takes it as I bleed can not stem.
If I can get my medical kit,
I 'r may be time to give.
Where's your kit?
- In my pocket.
Ed, can you get me the boot?
- The luggage?
Did you not outside army?
- Get me inside.
The boot is downstairs.
Just where you enter.
Are you sure?
- I did my test on that same plane.
I get sick when I step on that plane?
No idea.
- I have a daughter of three.
She is counting on me, you know?
- They are counting on you.
You must do something. Get help.
Please.
I have not baulk at.
I go along.
- Me too.
I left my wife on that laptop.
I need your help.
Stay here, can you?
Shilah Washington, you'll recognize my bag.
Fast.
Unbelievable.
- What happened?
What now?
Ops, answer.
I have energy again.
The energy is out. Forward.
We are going through.
Answer, I have energy now.
The energy is here too.
Captain?
Willsy?
The staircase is out of order.
Captain Forrest?
Willsy?
Anyone?
There is none.
Stay with me.
Captain.
This is really a mess.
I do not understand.
If he is not within... and everyone is gone...
- Then someone opened the gate.
I'm watching.
I take my laptop.
I have one.
Damn.
- It's only blood.
Damn.
Found.
It's Doc.
I'll see you at the gate.
- Wait.
They had never left when the gate was open.
Right?
- She's right.
The gate is still closed.
It's pretty close.
Please note that we get back to Doc.
Hasten.
Mandy Britts, three sacks.
Get your own damn bags.
We are looking for a bag, with the surname Washington.
They are broken during the turbulence. Sorry.
There goes my five dollars.
There.
What are you doing?
The world's a dangerous place.
I'll never run away.
After what I've seen here tonight, these things are mandatory on airplanes.
Such as belts.
I got it.
Come on, let's go...
Damn rat.
She came right to me.
A large red eyes.
Was certainly not a hamster?
- No, it looked like a rat.
We go.
Doc.
Rifle shots at the plane.
Look at me.
It's all right.
Out, quickly.
Careful.
Doc...
- He's fine.
Lift it up.
Help me.
I got you. Hold on.
Is he?
Let's go.
See if he was bitten.
What was that?
- Nothing. I see nothing.
Look everywhere.
Hello.
Help me.
What the hell is that?
Close the door!
Fucking bitch!
Go though it, we love her.
Go.
Jenny, we heard gunshots.
Keep pressure on it.
What happened?
- On the plane.
She bites and infected another.
- I do not understand.
The Captain... I got him shot.
- Your face is the blood.
The bathroom was empty, filled with blood, without the big guy.
We went in the hole...
Hold on.
I am.
On the side.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
I bite you.
Breathing.
We're safe. I took my gun.
Fortunately, because it sucks.
Why did the energy from?
You left this behind and I took on when your father called.
I would say you should take the stick and then fell all cell phones simultaneously.
My father gave me flying lessons since I was twelve.
He said:
Get on the stick.
I dared not only to fly even with him beside me.
He let the stick go.
We turned.
I had to take control.
I never understood why he did that.
I'll be back.
The door is closed.
- Everything stays on that plane.
Are you sure?
I did not Mr. Bunt. Do you?
I need you.
Come, we gotta go.
Listen.
- What do you want now?
I have something to say.
- You've said enough.
Listen to what she has to say.
Number one: We do not know when we are out of it.
Number two: We must ensure that no one is infected.
That's fucking brilliant.
- Smart.
And who's in charge?
I.
- You?
You know nothing.
- We must vote.
I have this.
- Shoot me down or shut up.
Our captain, Mr. Stubbins in 7A murdered, is dead.
Our copilot crawls through the plane like a beast.
This means that you are my passengers to this race is over.
Is that clear?
Quite clear.
What this is, it spreads through bites.
We do not know.
- I can just show a symptom.
It can spread through the air or locally.
We know nothing.
I think it's rabies.
Rabies people.
People Rabies?
- That it is spread by a bite?
Right?
- Maybe saliva.
Rabies can be cured. Vaccines.
That is you are sick.
There is no cure.
I think this is not rabies.
Rabies does not exhibit the same symptoms in humans.
If the virus does to the brains... the bastard is a threat.
They talked about 's building quarantined, somewhere in LA.
An apartment building.
- We also because we are from LA.
Twice an evening.
How often would that occur?
And your girlfriend, she is not infected?
No, she's bitten, but has no symptoms.
Doc!
Come here.
Gives you immediate medical kit.
Do not let him escape.
Do not let him bite.
He has bitten him.
One, two, three.
Did he bite you?
- No.
Are you sure?
Make it good.
This is wrong and inhuman.
He is bitten.
- It's for our own safety.
On three.
One, two, three.
You're in charge, right?
You have no choice.
I found something on the rat.
- What?
He has a label to.
- That 's a lab rat. Albino.
It's like that rat from the hall, and he behaves like that.
Like the other rats?
- Yes, and like the people.
This is because 's lab rat?
- How does a rat in the hold of a plane?
Ask him to.
- Who?
Did you participate in your lab rat cage?
No, those were the hamsters my niece.
When you came on board,
I saw tails in your cage.
What is he talking about?
I had hamsters when I was little.
They have tiny stumps, you barely see. No tails.
Hamster that I got from my parents, who had just returned from Ecuador.
I now know that hamsters no tails.
You making that up.
- Can I talk to you?
Of course.
Please tell me you're not rats in 't plane brought.
George is a bit confused now.
He and we all have 'n experienced a lot that night.
You tell me the truth?
You may not lab rats in your hand luggage.
Impossible. I was security never passed by.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
I accuse you, but I got better...
He's dead.
Hobbs, say it.
- The health service is underway.
The health service is on its way.
Understood, we are there.
How are you?
- He's lying.
You can not prove it, George.
You believe him because you like him.
The ammunition must be here somewhere in it.
Are you okay with George?
This may sound stupid, but have you seen my briefcase?
Hey, calm down.
You have the weapons to focus.
We want only way.
They should go to the hospital.
- If you cooperate, you are here quickly.
Listen to me...
- Put that camera away.
Put that camera away.
- Get rid of it.
What's that?
- Everything will be explained later.
I see a weapon.
- Deliver your weapon.
Give your weapon.
You three, here.
Get those people out. Both.
Relax.
- Forward.
You two, that table free.
The rest is here in a row.
What happens?
- Protocol, for your safety.
You are all exposed but we do not know who is infected.
You have been identified.
- Everything is explained.
What is that? What do you give them?
Who follows?
- I will not inject unknown.
Right?
However, Nial?
- Everything is explained.
Do it now.
- Take it from here if you want Protocol.
I'll go first.
Say your name into the camera.
This is Louise Tred Well.
The cat is infected.
- Keep them at bay.
Come on.
Open it.
We have a wounded.
Put that fucking door.
Let us out.
Forward!
Go to the door.
He's alive.
Pull him inside.
Make fast the door.
He was shot in the leg.
I hear them.
- They come from the plane. Forward.
I heard them.
- Let's go. Fast.
Ahead, lady.
Forward.
We have to get the boot.
This way.
Forward, fast.
Get in, quick.
What are you doing?
- Are you?
Step. Fast.
What are you doing?
- Get in.
He is infected, leave him behind.
He will murder you.
- I 'm not leaving.
Paula I have left.
We need to get her.
If your girlfriend is there,
You want her to look.
I do not understand.
She followed the protocol.
There is no protocol.
Perhaps I have too much time in the army, but everyone got another injection.
Medication.
- How to get there at?
Each capsule had a different color, own label.
Is this true?
- I can not talk about it.
I will give you explicit consent.
What happens?
How much do the health of this?
It is not the health, but the CBDT.
Chemical biological domestic terrorism.
Terrorism?
Homeland Security. An apartment
LA is under quarantine.
Our units have a 'n few hours to go.
No one has ever returned.
We found a
Bio-thermal laboratory.
Some kind of "doomsday" code.
- Wait.
Has anyone made this?
- The virus, yes. They sought 's remedy.
An antidote.
They have a clinical test done on humans.
We have a survivor test person found.
You could "to ostracize.
What they gave them, it was only much worse.
Rats were there too?
- Rats are carriers.
We thought we'd escape were yet to hold.
Our orders were you alive and to keep together.
You have no idea what it is or how to be treated?
If anything I have seen here, spread throughout our population... and we have no idea to address it...
- We are now testing the rats?
National security.
- They let us out of here again.
Put the gun down.
How about now?
There is no way out.
We will all die.
- It'll be fine.
Lie not constant.
There is no way out.
There must be a way out,
We will find a way out.
I will not die.
- It'll be fine.
Shut up.
The rain...
- What?
This terminal is filling up during heavy rainfall.
They say there is a tunnel, never properly closed.
There is a tunnel?
- Are you serious now?
Terminal F would vanish, it would never be built... the FAA had no money.
Where is that tunnel?
- No idea... but I know where to look.
We need to...
Shoot him down.
Shoot me.
- There are no more bullets.
George, press the green button.
Follow me.
Be quiet.
Let's have at the office.
We must find the tunnel to Terminal F.
Henrie is true?
They have her address.
- Move!
Forward.
Come on, do not stop.
What was that?
Go on, keep walking.
Stand up, Jenny.
She is infected.
Paula?
Paula, stay where you are.
Give me the wrench.
Come on.
Come on, I got you.
Go on, boy.
You go for it.
- There it is.
Inside.
Look for blueprints of Terminal F.
Where to look?
- In the corner stands.
What are you doing, George?
Have you stolen from Henrie?
- Look at this.
Found. The design of Terminal F.
Where are we now?
Terminal F. I think this is it.
We are here and the entrance to the tunnel in a shaft.
Here, somewhere behind the staff room.
- How do we get there?
We go through the security area to the hangar.
We have through the wall, in that space between.
Once we are here, we only to the service tunnel.
Then we went to Terminal F.
They have your address.
That's a bite impression.
But it is okay, right?
As you do this in your possession.
I found it in his briefcase.
Give it.
Is that the antidote that you tested in that apartment building in LA?
Give me, George.
- Who are you?
As I told you earlier,
I hear the good.
I wanted to mean something.
Responsibilities for the future.
By causing a nuisance?
- Nobody else is doing something about it.
Do you?
- How many people do you want this killing?
As much as necessary.
- So you decide who survives?
No, we do. Because the alternative is, no one survives.
Our population keeps growing and consume while our planet is dying.
Do not let me shoot you, George.
Enter here.
Against the wall.
Against the wall.
How did you pass
Security got?
Like the rats.
Just as I found out that my lab in LA was in danger and had to leave the city.
Supporters of this case.
The same that my arrival
Kansas City safely be arranged. and help me, once I'm here.
Antibodies to the virus control so the infection does not damage the brains.
What is that?
You're a smart guy.
Smart enough for you ever to join us.
Fuck you.
Do not believe all the nonsense of the government.
They entitle people like us, as extremists or terrorists... because it is easier than the truth.
What do you think is the truth then?
The earth can be a good use plague.
One that will kill you.
Amazing.
I feel nothing.
Does it?
- I've done the tests themselves in LA.
That would not have been better.
- Shut up.
Time to go, George.
- No, let him go.
This is his only chance.
Forward.
Come on, Jenny.
We have to chase them.
Up.
I'll get to you later.
- Take this.
I'll go first. I grab him well.
- Fast.
Let me go.
I am.
- Shilah, what is that?
Night vision goggles, the health has left behind.
Then you see them before they are yours.
George Henrie and there are went inside. It's a trap.
How did you find?
Here.
It was not my day to fly.
Care for George and kill the rat.
I will try some time for you to win.
Hey, sucker biting,
I'm here, assholes.
These are just mice.
Hold on, George,
I'm coming down.
No, the antidote did not Henrie.
Do not come down.
- There is a flashlight at your feet.
I do not see him.
I'm coming down, stay where you are George.
No, do not come.
Do not.
Return to top.
Stay there.
Please go back.
Please do not throw the camera.
You there.
Did you hit him?
Where is he?
- Look.
Involved?
Did he bite you?
- No.
What happened?
- When we climbed down... he tried to bite me.
The terminal.
- They burn it off.
Come on, here.
It is the tunnel to Terminal F.
- It is closed.
There is no way out.
Stay here.
It's locked,
We never come here.
Yes, but I get it get it.
- It makes no sense.
Stay where you are.
We gotta go.
- I'm not going inside.
You have no choice.
Trust me.
I can not. Really.
There is no other option.
You are my eyes.
Tell me what you see.
I see nothing.
It's just the baggage tunnel.
I'll be right behind you.
Promise?
- I promise, and now.
Keep going.
Can you see anything?
Go on, George, do not stop.
Hurry.
Why do you stop?
Go on.
Do not stop.
I'm infected.
Go on.
No, that's not true.
Just as we reached that point.
I'm sorry.
I feel it.
I do not have much time.
It'll be fine.
- Go.
Your nothing wrong.
- Leave me here.
I'm not leaving without you.
Leave me here.
You will not hurt me.
I'm not leaving without you.
Good?
I think I see...
Jenny, we made it.
Come here.
I'm not leaving without you.
THE SKIN I LIVE IN
Help me with the dumb waiter.
Open it.
Take this.
Marilia, are you there?
Yes.
Send up more cloth and double-sided tape.
I can't get it until tomorrow.
OK.
I also wanted a needle, thread and scissors.
You're joking, right?
Yeah.
Our face identifies us.
For burn victims, saving their lives is not enough.
They need to have a face even if it's from a corpse.
A face with features... so they can gesticulate.
I have participated in three out of the nine face transplants carried out in the world... and they were the most moving experiences of my life.
Good...
For a shapeless mass to acquire the features that will give it expression... we have to mould the muscles... articulating the facial musculature with the corresponding nerve endings.
MATERNITY HOSPITAL
Vera, I've brought you some opium.
OPERATING THEATER
Can you breathe more gently?
If you want me to stop breathing, kill me.
Don't talk rubbish.
How long will all this last?
Your skin is softer than I thought.
If you don't end it, I will.
If you'd wanted to kill yourself... you'd have tried to cut your jugular.
In any case...
I didn't know your skin was so soft.
Here it is... taken from the animal while it was still alive.
Thank you.
Now there won't be any more burns.
You said that a year ago.
I was hasty.
Tell me if it burns you.
No.
And now?
No.
Now!
I have given the name "Gal"... to the artificial skin
I've been working on... in recent years.
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.
This skin is resistant to every insect bite...
No.
...which means a natural barrier to
...malaria, for example.
Naturally, I've carried out a rigorous quality control... on the tissues implanted in mammals... specifically, in athymic mice... and the results...
...have been spectacular.
This leads me to suppose they would be equally positive... in human mammals.
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?
That was my wife's name.
She was burned to death in a car crash.
In you presentation you stated... that the skin is resistant to insect bites and could prevent malaria.
What makes you think that?
The artificial skin is much harder than human skin... and it smells different.
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito... distinguishes human skin by the smell.
Gal smells different and repels it.
Let's see if we can get rid of him.
That isn't enough.
How did you toughen the skin?
Excuse me.
Let's go somewhere quieter.
There's only one way to toughen skin.
By mutating it.
Yes, that's what I did.
Transgenesis.
Yes.
I transferred genetic information... from a pig's cell to a human cell.
A pig's cell?
It's much stronger than ours.
You're insane!
You know the application of transgenetic therapy... in humans is completely forbidden!
Yes, I do.
And, forgive me, but it seems the ultimate paradox.
We intervene in everything around us... meat, clothes, vegetables, fruit, everything!
Why not use scientific advances to improve our species?
You know how many diseases... we could cure with transgenesis?
Or the genetic malformations that could be avoided?
Don't go on!
I know the list by heart... and I think of it every day.
But even so...
I must forbid you from investigating further... or I'll be forced to report you... to the scientific community.
Over and above what you or I may think... the bioethics are absolutely clear about this.
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.
I did it in memory of my wife... and solely to extend my knowledge.
I remember... the first time you told me about this experiment.
It seemed like a dream then.
And it still is.
The president has ordered me to give it up, indefinitely.
Shit, and it'll be the business of the century.
It will be, but we won't benefit from it.
If you give up research, will you go back to surgery?
Your patients will be delighted.
I don't know.
We've got a waiting list for operations in "El Cigarral".
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.
Do you like what you see?
What do you mean?
Is there anything you want to improve?
No.
I don't want to improve anything.
Can I take it I'm finished?
Yes... and you can boast of having the best skin in the world.
And now what?
Now I'm going to light this opium pipe... and smoke it.
I mean us.
Me.
What are you going to do with me?
I don't know.
I'll think about it.
When?
If you keep on, I'm leaving!
Couldn't we just live?
Live together.
Live together?
- How?
- Like everyone.
You and I aren't like everyone.
Look on it as another of your experiments.
Living together as equals.
That's it!
Here.
I could set fire to the house with this.
I'm yours.
I'm made to measure for you.
And you've just told me that you like me.
Did I say that?
I know you look at me.
Since you brought me here, we practically live in the same room.
In this pocket.
Carnival celebrations are being held on the Gran Via.
You shouldn't have used her face.
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.
There's a resemblance, but she isn't the same.
The resemblance is too strong.
Have you thought what to do with her?
No.
You'll have to kill her or keep her hidden here forever.
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?
If you don't kill her, she'll kill herself.
Stories repeat themselves.
No! Not this one!
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.
You're sick.
If you don't get rid of her... what you feel now will end up devouring you, like a cancer.
When you realize, it'll be too late.
How are you so sure of what I feel if even I don't know?
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.
Fire the servants and don't hire anyone.
What do you want?
To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.
If she was a servant... they've just left and won't be back.
I saw them, but she wasn't one of them.
My mother is prettier.
Go away or I'll call the police.
Zeca!
I'm your son, Zeca.
How dare you come here!
Open the door!
It's Carnival. We're both far from Bahia and I'm homesick.
Look! Like the costume I wore when I was little. Remember?
Little tiger!
I just want to see you for a minute.
Very well, but then you leave.
Whatever you say.
Follow the path and keep going through the second gate.
How did you find us?
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.
He was giving a...
I don't know, something in Madrid.
I went there and then followed him here.
Can't I come in?
No, I'm not allowed visitors.
It smells good.
I'm hungry.
Brute!
The main new items today...
are the Carnival celebrations...
and the daring robbery committed in the Bvlgari jewellery store...
in the heart of Madrid.
It happened last night...
and today we have the first images recorded by one...
of the twenty-four security cameras which protect the jewellery store.
Apart from the thief, who appears in the image...
police are looking for one of the store's employees...
who has been missing for the last twenty-four hours.
As if they were going to find him!
The bastard just had to turn off the cameras... but he changed his mind and left one working.
He'll be rotting in hell now.
And the police are looking for you.
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.
You can hide me here for a few days.
Hide you here?
Not a chance.
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.
I know how to hide.
Anyway, I want Robert to operate on my face.
Robert?
When he gets you on the table... he'll give you a lethal injection!
How could you think he'd operate on you... after what you did?
I'll have to blackmail him.
If I kidnap you, could I make him do it?
You're raving mad.
I'm just a servant.
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.
Even better.
I'll stay here till he comes back.
Where are you going?
- What do you want
- A drink.
Take the bottle, take what you want, just get out!
What's this?
It's a film!
Go away!
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!
Get out or I'll shoot.
Mom... you wouldn't do that to your son.
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.
- It's her.
- It's not her!
How could it be her?
Get out of here!
Keep away!
Marilia?
I heard a noise, like a shot.
Is anything wrong?
I heard voices too.
Marilia?
Marilia!
There.
Who is it?
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.
I can't.
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.
Does Marilia have it?
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.
Where's the key to upstairs?
In the drawer at the corner.
Untie me and I'll give it to you.
No, where is it?
In that drawer, in an envelope.
- It's not here!
- At the back!
There's just an envelope that says "clips".
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!
Open your mouth!
Open it wider, mom!
It all fit before.
Did Robert send you?
No.
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.
He saved me.
Get me out of here!
I'll go anywhere with you!
You're saying that... because I'm on top of you.
No!
Ask me for anything!
What can you give me, apart from a great fuck?
I don't know. Lots of things!
I'll do whatever you want.
You could help me with Robert.
How do you get on with him now?
Great.
- Great?
- Yes.
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!
Yes.
I'll take you with me.
That might soften his heart and he'll fix my face.
If you kidnap me, you can ask him for anything!
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.
Listen...
What?
Let’s fuck in the garden, please!
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.
This tiger wants a bed.
Don't you like it?
You're hurting me.
It's very big.
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.
Yes... and it still does.
It drives me crazy!
Shut up! You're weird, you're distracting me.
Kill her!
Kill them both!
As children, they played at killing each other.
I knew that one day they'd do it for real.
The tiger and Robert?
Yes.
They're brothers... but they don't know it.
At least I've never told them.
I had Zeca by a servant who disappeared soon after.
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.
Their fathers were very different but both were born insane.
It's my fault.
I've got insanity in my entrails.
I'd served at the Ledgards' house since I was a child.
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile... and when my Robert was born, they kept him... and said she'd given birth to him.
But I was the one who looked after him from the day he was born.
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.
When he was seven, he started transporting drugs.
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.
He was on the run and asked us for shelter.
I hid him in an outhouse, but Gal found him... she took a fancy to him... and they ended up running away together.
Their car crashed,
Zeca survived and ran away.
But she...
Robert found her, horribly burned, but still with a flicker of life.
He snatched her back from death at the last minute.
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.
He didn't sleep.
He only rested when he sat by the bed where she was lying... covered with gauzes.
He was intoxicated by the smell of burned flesh.
After the accident, we lived like vampires... in total darkness and with no mirrors.
To everyone's surprise... after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.
The things that a madman's love can do!
One day... when she could finally stand unaided...
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance... singing a song that she had taught her.
And she got emotional.
For the first time in many months, she got emotional.
And it was... like feeling she was alive again.
When she opened the window... she suddenly saw her image reflected in the glass.
She didn't look human.
She was a cinder.
She gave a scream that echoed through the house... and threw herself out the window.
Years later, little Norma... went in search of her mother... along the same road her mother had taken.
Through the window.
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.
Did you pray?
Yes.
Everything you told me.
Shall we go inside?
Do you mind if we leave it for tomorrow?
The tiger really messed me up.
As you wish.
But hold me!
Don't worry, I'll wait.
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.
Thank you!
I'm falling asleep.
Sleep, my love.
SIX YEARS EARLIER
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.
Without your help, he'd adore me less.
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.
Your daughter is getting on well with my nieces.
She seems much better...
At least she isn't afraid of people now.
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come to ask if we can leave.
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.
To you!
You've had him long enough, it's my turn.
Enjoy him, darling.
Excuse me.
Norma!
Norma!
Norma!
Norma!
Norma!
Sweetheart, it's me!
There, there!
What about this one?
Yes, but... no.
And it looks a bit old.
It's not old, it's vintage.
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.
No flowers.
Something like this?
Not stripes either.
No stripes.
Something graphic?
Graphic?
Like this?
I'll come back another day.
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.
Cristina...
Here. On the house.
Put it on and we'll go partying.
I'm meeting my girlfriend.
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.
It'll look great on you.
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.
You're so mistaken!
Because I don't like men?
Because you don't like me.
In any case...
I've got pills to get you in the mood.
You shouldn't take that shit.
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!
I'm off.
Where to?
Home, to get changed.
How come?
I'm meeting my pals.
I think we're going to Casilda's party.
Were you invited?
Jorge knows one of the nieces.
We're just going to the dance.
Well? Are you coming?
Leave her alone, you pain.
Good afternoon.
Hello.
My wife has left us... and I was wondering if you'd want her clothes.
- Josefina?
- Yes.
Well... we don't have anything for fat women...
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.
They're very nice.
We'll look at them and let you know.
- Of course.
- It's this, right?
Yes.
It's heavy.
It certainly is.
But... did she leave or has she disappeared?
Both things.
To be honest... she does it regularly.
We're used to it.
So the next time she does it... she'll have to leave naked because I'm selling her clothes.
I'll show you the garden.
What a party!
Fresh air!
You're all stoners!
I'm Vicente.
I'm Norma.
Your friends have gone.
All the better, right?
Are you stoned?
Stoned?
Have you taken any pills?
Yes.
Cipralex 20...
100 mg of Deprax...
2 g of Trankimazin.
I don't take Rohipnol now.
And Lyrica, of course.
Shit!
I'm high as hell too.
High?
Yes.
You're not from here, are you?
No. Are you?
Yes, but I want to get away...
I'm sick of these high heels!
And this jacket!
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.
Wait.
I'll leave you naked.
You're so pretty... and different.
I'm different too.
Are you in treatment too?
No.
Do you think I should be?
I don't know.
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...
"I Need To Love".
This is also for the bride... with all my affection.
No!
Shut up!
Stop!
Cristina...
If I left, you'd stay here with my mother, wouldn't you?
Yes... but where are you going?
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.
That's because of all the stuff you take.
I haven't taken anything in a week.
Then it's because of that.
So should I take it or not?
It's best not to.
I'm going out.
Now? Without finishing it?
Yes.
Are you coming for supper or will you be late?
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.
Are you leaving that mess?
I'll finish it tomorrow.
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?
Son of a bitch!
Bastard!
Are you crazy?
Don't shoot!
Help!
Help!
Come in.
Sit down, please.
Thank you.
I was told there's news.
We found the bike, totally destroyed, at the Finisterre cliffs.
And the body?
Nothing.
It must have been washed out to sea.
We're very sorry, ma'am.
My son is alive.
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike... but my son?
He could have been kidnapped.
Until his body appears, you must keep looking, please!
We've talked about this already, ma'am.
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!
If he is, he's far away.
All his friends that were questioned, even your assistant... all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.
But he said he'd be home for supper.
Cristina heard him.
If he didn't call me, it's because something happened.
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.
Norma...
Sweetheart...
I won't touch you.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Norma, love.
Everything OK?
Yes.
It's me, Norma.
You can come out, the men have gone.
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.
We tried... but she can't stand any kind of fitted clothing.
She rips it off.
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think you should visit her so often.
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.
And she gets worse when she sees you.
In her mind, she's convinced you attacked her.
I just found her lying there!
Why can't you get that into her head?
She identifies you with the rapist.
Maybe... we let her out too soon.
It was your idea that she should socialize.
She was getting over her social phobia.
How could I know... someone would try to rape her while she was with you.
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!
Help!
Get me out of here!
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.
You'll eat and drink now.
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Come over here, you bastard, and set me free!
Turn around!
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.
But, why?
I haven't done anything.
You'll be more comfortable there.
Eat.
Thank you!
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.
I've been alone for so long.
Wait, please! Don't go!
Please, don't go!
We have to talk.
My condolences.
We did what we could.
It wasn't enough and you did it very badly.
I'm going to report the hospital, and you in particular... for homicidal negligence.
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...
You really want to work today?
Yes.
You should rest and try to forget.
I couldn't sleep, and working will keep my mind occupied.
- Call the whole team.
- OK.
My mother will be very worried.
I never stay away without calling her.
You have a daughter, haven't you?
Why do you say that?
The toys...
My daughter is dead.
We buried her today.
I'm sorry.
And now, some aftershave.
Why did you shave me?
That's a good question.
Yes?
It's us.
I'll let you in.
If he says we're late, say there were two accidents on the road
You know how he is about punctuality.
Good evening.
You're late.
There were two accidents on the road.
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.
When you're ready, we'll start.
Two accidents, one near that town...
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.
He isn't.
He's 27 and he knows exactly what he wants.
It's a particularly confidential case.
What's happened?
What did you do to me?
A vaginoplasty
No...
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.
It's very important.
As you've just seen, the operation was successful... but the tissues of the vagina are still very tender and could stick together.
But don't worry, it's easy to prevent that.
You...
You have to keep the new orifice open... and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.
Think that your life depends on that orifice... that you breathe through it.
In this case... there are several dilators of different sizes.
Start by inserting the smallest one.
It will hurt at first... but in a few months... the largest one will fit without any effort... and the skin... will be perfectly healed.
This is very good.
How long have you been using the last dilator?
Four weeks.
Can I go now?
- Go where?
- Home.
But we've just started.
What else are you going to do?
You'll see, when the time comes.
Why are you doing this?
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?
In that spectacular house?
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.
I don't think I actually raped her.
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?
I'd taken a lot of pills and I can hardly remember it.
Well I didn't take anything and I'll never forget it!
What are you going to do now?
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?
They're like drops of water sliding along a glass surface.
The marks on your skin will disappear.
There's still work to do.
But to put you mind at ease, there'll be no more burns.
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.
It'll also give you support and mould you.
Get used to wearing it all the time... like a second skin.
Put it on.
Will you zip me up, please?
Bitch!
Stop!
Give me the key or I'll come up and stab you!
Stay where you are!
I'll slit my throat... and then you'll have no toy!
You wouldn't dare.
We were lucky.
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER
I can't keep calling you Vicente.
From today, your name is Vera.
I don't know if you're there.
I'm returning the makeup book and the makeup.
Do what you want with them.
...and you can practice it anywhere...
on a hospital bed, in jail.
There's a place where you can take refuge...
a place inside you...
a place to which...
no one else has access...
a place that no one can destroy.
To access that place there is yoga...
an ancient technique.
It's a place where you'll find peace, where you'll find tranquillity...
freedom.
But you must practice it...
continuously, intensely...
and then you'll achieve it.
YOGA BOOKS
My Cigarral!
I missed it so much!
These four years seemed eternal!
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.
I thought you'd forgotten me.
I thought that... at least you'd have called me when Norma died.
My poor child.
To throw herself out the window!
I'd rather not talk about it.
As you wish.
But I'm going to miss her so much!
Let's go to the kitchen.
I'm parched.
Don't look at the surfaces.
Everything has to be cleaned.
Call the agency and hire the help you need.
You've installed more televisions.
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.
I'll explain.
From now on, you'll look after her.
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.
You've put on your uniform.
You don't have to wear it.
I like the uniform... because it means we're together again.
Who is she?
I told you.
Her name's Vera.
What's she doing?
She's writing on the wall.
I can see that.
It smells of croquettes.
She called me on the intercom... and asked who I was and what day it was.
When I told her she started writing on the wall.
I don't want her to take liberties with you.
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.
She reminds me of someone.
All the women I've operated on end up reminding you of someone.
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.
BACK TO THE PRESENT
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.
I don't trust you.
If you did, it would be much easier for the three of us.
Pass me the tray.
No. I'll take it up.
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Breakfast.
Thank you.
Where's Marilia?
In the kitchen, grumbling.
She doesn't like anyone else looking after you.
Last night... before we went to bed... we talked a lot and we made a promise.
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.
You promised me that there'd be no more locked doors... that I could see all the TV channels... that I was free.
And I promised you that I'd never leave you.
Don't let me down.
It's all I have, Robert.
Your promise and mine.
Have you really thought about what we're going to do?
When we're in the streets she could push me and run off.
She promised not to.
And you believe her?
You're like a child.
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!
That's enough!
I'm sorry I took so long.
I've put on high heels to practice.
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.
Thank you.
Come along, child!
Have you a problem with me?
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.
I want to talk about the clinic.
I told you on the phone.
After talking to the president...
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.
But if things are done carefully, there's no reason to worry.
It's not just that.
I've got other plans that don't include operating.
If you don't want to operate, we'll rent the clinic from you.
I'm speaking for all the team.
Our main patients love the isolation here.
I said no, Fulgencio.
And now I'd like to be alone.
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.
Are you still here?
I'm leaving now... but first I'd like you to see today's paper.
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.
We gave him a sex change.
He disappeared from his home on September 10, 2006... as you can see.
And?
I was always surprised he wanted to get a cunt... without hormones.
He only wanted a cunt.
He's much more muscular now and he's working in L. A... in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?
It says that his mother is still searching desperately for him.
Don't go there.
Those documents you gave us were all false.
It wouldn't be the first time... we accepted false documents.
Why do you think our clients prefer this place?
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.
I think you kidnapped him... and you've been experimenting on him in every sense.
You told us... you'd tested your new skin on athymic mice.
Knowing you as I do...
I think you'd have no scruples about testing it on a human being.
On Vicente, for example.
Do you know what would happen to you... if the scientific community found out you used transgenesis... on someone you'd kidnapped?
I don't like threats, they end up infecting me.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Get the hell out of here!
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.
And... what's that transgenesis?
A cream?
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.
And my name isn't Vicente, it's Vera.
Vera Cruz!
And I was always a woman!
Give me a cigarette.
Thank you.
No, I thank you.
Does it still hurt?
Yes.
Shall we do it from behind?
Wouldn't that hurt more?
- Wait...
- What?
Just today I bought lubricating cream.
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.
I'm sure I put it in my new purse... but I can't find it.
You must have left it downstairs.
I'll go and get it.
Vera!
Hurry up!
At last!
I thought you'd gone.
Not yet.
Come on...
What are you doing?
I'm going to kill you.
This is a joke, right?
Call it what you want.
But you promised!
I lied.
Robert?
Robert?
He's asleep.
I heard a noise.
Yes, so did I.
Go back to bed, it was nothing.
Robert!
My son!
Come out of there! Bitch!
Where are you?
I knew it.
Hello.
You see to her.
Good morning.
What did you want?
Is anything wrong?
Are you all right?
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.
Do you know me?
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.
I had to kill two people to get away.
You have to help me.
Look.
Do you remember this dress?
Before Casilda's wedding, six years ago...
I said I'd give it to you... just to see how it looked.
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.
At that moment we were alone, remember?
Is anything wrong?
Come here a moment, ma'am.
Why are you crying?
I'm Vicente.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Man: I'm coming!
I'm coming.
Hi.
I'm Jennifer Hills.
We spoke last week.
Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.
Mockingbird Trail, right?
That is right.
I don't suppose you know how to get out there.
No, I don't.
Well, listen up.
It's a bit tricky.
- Keys.
- Thank you.
These arrows will get you through town.
Over here there are more dirt roads and woods.
Your cabin's a real beaut.
But heck, there ain't another for a good country mile.
I am looking forward to the peace and quiet.
I'm actually a novelist and I'm starting my next book here.
If that's what you're aiming for.
- You just follow this here map.
- Thank you.
Howdy, ma'am.
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
No, that is okay.
You know what?
I am actually lost.
I'm looking for Mockingbird Trail.
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.
- Really?
- Yeah yeah, you're lost.
It's about 10 miles back.
It's gonna be on your left-hand side.
Gonna make a left after a big red mailbox.
Okay, thanks.
I think I saw that.
You staying over in that cabin on Mockingbird?
- Yeah.
- Man: Fancy!
So you know you're running a little hot.
Maybe I should check up under your hood for you.
How's that line working for you?
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?
- I got that.
- No, I got it.
No, I got it.
Oh shit.
I'm sorry, my bad.
- I hit the panic button.
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Better check your underwear,
Johnny.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I said I was fine.
- Okay.
- All right?
Keep the change.
Man:
Got you that time, Johnny.
Bye-bye.
Woman:
How's the writing coming?
You kidding me?
I should have come out here on my first book.
You gonna come back for Hertz's party?
Jen? Did I lose you?
Oh, sorry.
Something just-
Hey.
- You still there?
- Barb, hold on a second.
- Jen, what's going on?
- Let me call you back.
You've got to be kidding me.
Way to go, Jennifer.
Ugh.
Ew!
Jennifer:
No, it won't flush.
Man: Did you check the seal on the flapper?
I did that already.
- You did?
- Yes.
Look, I'm really in a spot here.
- All right, I'll send somebody.
- Okay okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- You'll be there?
- I'm not going anywhere.
Man:
All right, I'll send someone.
Aggh!
So is this gonna take much longer?
Not much.
What's wrong with it?
Yes!
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.
Sorry. You saved me from having to bathe in the lake.
Excuse me.
I, uh- excuse me.
Wait, I didn't-
Ground rule double.
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.
Fine, maybe a triple.
But you gotta knock its guts clean out its mouth if you wanna score a run.
Man, would you turn that shit off?
You're gonna get us in trouble with that human society.
- It's humane, dipshit.
- Yeah, whatever.
I told you, Andy, this thing's gonna make me a fortune.
So you two retards gonna go fishing or what?
Hey, speaking of retards...
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!
Well, Stanley, got us all here now.
What's the big show?
The big show is this.
What did you do this time, film yourself lighting a fart?
I don't know why I bother with you dipshits.
I got Matthew's girlfriend here in a very private moment.
Andy:
Girlfriend?
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since he was sucking on his mama's titties.
He had that city girl all alone and he didn't even try to nail her.
What city girl?
You know what girl.
The one from the gas station the other day.
The one that had you on your ass.
She had Matt here fixing her pipes.
She even gave him a kiss for servicing her.
Bullshit.
No, she- she- she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.
Hey, Matthew, don't you lie to me.
Here it comes.
Get ready for it.
Oh shit.
Andy: Hey, that's some good camerawork, man.
You dirty dog, man.
How the fuck did you get that?
I've been working nights.
She sure is something to look at.
Yeah yeah.
And she likes me.
Come on, Matthew.
That girl wouldn't even give Johnny the time of day.
What?
Shit.
I can tame that ass if I want to.
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.
Stuck-up city bitch.
City bitch like that is ungettable.
Bullshit. I'll get it.
Let me tell you something:
I had that bitch creaming her panties.
Yeah, and she had you shitting in yours.
You don't think I can have that anytime I want to?
Hmm?
Let me tell you something:
Bitch like that, she come out here for one reason and one reason only.
Titties flopping in the window like that for everyone to see.
Come on, you know.
No no.
She's not like that, Johnny.
They're all like that.
Big city cock-teasing whore is all she is.
Fuckin' A.
Shit, Matthew.
You wouldn't know what to do with a piece of ass like that if you got it.
No shit.
But you're lucky
'cause I'm your friend.
I'll show you the way.
Hello.
Nice shot, huh?
Evening.
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!
Well now.
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?
Smile real pretty for the camera, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.
You all better get out of here right now.
I called the cops.
Oh, she called the cops.
You called the police or you will call the police?
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.
What phone did you do that with?
Matthew told us you dropped yours in the drain.
Bloop!
Let's pick it up.
Where the hell is that boy?
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.
Get in here, boy.
Hey hey hey.
It's all right.
Come on now.
Come on, boy.
Come here.
Matthew here says that you didn't pay him for fixing your sink.
That's not true.
He ran out.
I'll take care of it.
Andy:
He's shy, huh?
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.
Hold up, wait a minute.
Let's not worry about any of that right now.
What's a pretty little thing like you doing out here all alone?
I'm writing.
I'm a writer.
She's a writer.
My boyfriend will be here soon.
He's coming up to the cabin.
Is that right?
Oh!
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Boys, now we better blow on out of here.
We don't wanna interrupt your date night.
Date night!
Let me tell you something, sweetheart:
There ain't no man in his right mind that leaves a pretty little thing like you out here all alone.
He's coming.
Night's almost over.
Oh wow.
Johnny:
Come here.
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.
Come here, pretty little thing.
Come here, have a drink with me.
No.
Oh, there you go.
I don't want to.
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?
- See?
- Mm-hmm.
Please, I just don't want to have a drink.
What is this shit right here?
'Cause that's already been opened.
Well shit, boys.
You were right.
She's too good to have a drink with us.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
What are we to you?
A bunch of dirt?
I didn't say that.
Fuckin' A, this bitch is a writer.
"No one wants a phone call at 2:00 in the morning.
When you're 15, it's a prank call.
When you're 21, it's a drunk boyfriend call.
But after 25, it's usually really bad news.
That's how I found out my father died. "
Whose daddy died?
Can't you all just please leave me alone?
Johnny: No!
Just tell me what you want.
What do you want?
I offered you my money.
Mm-hmm.
Whoa!
Here. Here.
Fine. I'll have a drink.
Then you have to leave.
- Andy: All right.
- Johnny: All right.
That ain't shit.
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.
Now see, I-
I know you can do better than that.
I'm sure that when you're out there in the city with all your hoity-toity rich friends,
I bet you can throw 'em back with the best of 'em.
Now can't you?
- I took the drink-
- I said drink that shit!
- Come on. There you go.
- Chug chug! Guzzle!
- Whoo!
- There it is. There it is.
All right, shit.
See, that's not so bad now, is it?
Listen, I'm sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.
But we're even now, right?
Okay?
Just please leave.
Please leave.
Well, that's just not what this is about no more.
What is it about?
I wanna see your teeth.
What?
You heard me, pretty little show horse.
I want to see your teeth.
That-
I don't want to- no.
Now you're gonna show them teeth.
You have beautiful teeth.
There.
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.
Let's see more.
Put your fingers on the inside of your mouth right there.
Now take the other two, stick 'em on the other side.
There you go.
Now pull.
Okay, please, I'm begging you, just go.
No.
Again.
Come here.
There it is.
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.
Shh!
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.
You know why I know you ain't got no boyfriend?
You know why?
'Cause all them city boys are faggots.
Fuckin' A.
Since you ain't got no boyfriend, well, shit, I figured that... this would be your man tonight.
Yeah.
No?
Come here.
Come on, give him a little kiss.
Give him a little kiss, come on.
Give him a little kiss here.
Give him a little kiss here. Kiss him.
Oh shit, come on now.
Come on now. I ain't talking about no fucking peck like you gave Matthew.
I want you to give him a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.
Get up on your knees.
If I don't like your enthusiasm,
I may come bad.
Open up.
Open up.
There it is. There it is.
There it is.
All right, all right.
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.
Just like it's your first time again.
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.
All right, all right.
Shit!
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.
I d-don't want to.
I don't.
What?
What the fuck did you say?
What the hell you mean you d-d-don't want to?
I don't want to, Johnny.
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.
Listen to me.
Fuck that, man.
I ain't fucking waiting.
Aw shit!
Matthew:
She-she likes me.
Johnny:
She likes you, Matthew?
Go ahead.
- Jennifer: Please.
- Suck it, bitch.
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.
Go prove it to me.
Uh-huh.
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!
Johnny:
Come on, boys!
Whoa there.
Whoa there.
Easy, darling.
- Help me! Help me, please.
- Okay, I got you.
I was assaulted.
He came into my cabin and he had a gun.
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.
It was in my mouth.
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.
I know this one.
She rented the place down on Mockingbird Trail.
- I was assaulted.
- Hey, it's okay.
I'm a sheriff.
You're safe.
Now tell me what happened.
These four men- there were four men and they broke into my cabin.
And they had a gun and they assaulted me.
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?
Yes, I'd seen them.
- Around here?
- Yes, they work at the service station
- right outside of town.
- John Miller, no doubt.
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.
Sounds like them boys have been up to no good again.
All right, Earl, you head on back.
- Me and Miss-
- Hills. Jennifer Hills.
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head on over to the cabin and straighten things out.
Miller!
Miller, this is the sheriff.
You and your boys are still here, you come on out right now.
Miller, if you're up there, you'll be leaving by the window.
Ma'am, stay here.
You here alone?
Yes.
With all this?
I didn't plan on drinking it all right away.
I was gonna be here for a couple months.
You drink some this evening?
Yes.
One of them went upstairs and he went through everything.
They do this too?
Please, I really don't care about any of that.
How long you been here?
Just a couple days.
Anything strange happen before this?
You have a run-in with any of these guys?
No, not really.
Just stopped for gas and directions.
Ma'am, is this your marijuana cigarette?
Um, no.
One of the boys must have left it.
You mean to tell me one of them guys is wearing lipstick?
This ain't the big city.
Please, I may have smoked a joint, but that doesn't mean that I made any of this up.
This is Storch.
I'm at Mockingbird cabin.
- Gonna need some backup.
- Backup?
What could you possibly need backup for? I'm the victim.
Ma'am, you've been drinking, smoking marijuana cigarettes.
You got enough booze in here to put the whole town three sheets to the wind.
You're running around in your sleeping garments at the crack of dawn.
You gotta see this from my point of view.
What? They came in here and they assaulted me.
You have to believe me.
Ma'am, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this.
You're making serious accusations about boys I've known since they was kids.
And you haven't been altogether truthful now, have you?
Now please, step up against the wall.
Shoulder width apart.
Ma'am, please.
Look right ahead.
Now...
I want the whole story.
You tell me the whole thing.
You start by telling me what those boys did.
Tell the sheriff the truth, show horse.
Better yet, why don't you show him?
Show him how that pretty little mouth of yours couldn't get enough
- as far as I recall.
- Is that right?
They do this?
Nice little tits.
I asked you a question.
Please.
Johnny: You show the sheriff your teeth there, show horse.
Come on.
- Come on, move.
- Andy: Get!
Move!
Now whinny.
I said whinny!
- Whinny!
- Oh, man!
Whinny! Whinny! Whinny!
Huh. Huh.
Now get on your knees.
Keep going.
Johnny:
Keep whinnying, show horse.
Stanley:
Here we go.
Get on your knees.
Keep whinnying!
Oh-ho-ho!
You oughta tame that little mare of yours.
Come on.
On your feet, show horse.
On your feet or you're not gonna get your sugar cube.
Matthew, get your clothes off, boy.
We're gonna get your cherry popped.
Huh-uh.
Matthew, I ain't asking you a question.
Stop that rubber band shit, homo.
You wanna talk the talk, you better walk the walk.
I'm walking.
- Jennifer: Stop, stop.
- Virgin.
Please stop.
You get your clothes off or I'm gonna slice her from the chin
- to cunt.
- Oh!
Oh yeah!
- Johnny: There's Matthew.
- Stanley: Now he gets it.
Johnny:
Pants off, boy.
Oh, what the hell, Matthew?
He ain't even hard yet.
Well, it's not totally his fault.
She ain't done much to get his motor running now, has she?
Dance.
Dance.
Come on.
- Come on, baby.
- Move it!
Johnny: Prance for us.
Prance, show horse!
Prance for us now. Come on, like you do when you wanna get laid.
Whoo! Come on!
I want you to watch this,
Matthew.
You dance like that in them city clubs?
- Ho!
- Come on now!
You watching this, boy?
Johnny: What?
Okay, I'll- I'll- I'll-
I'll do it.
Okay? Okay.
- Come here.
- Oh, yeah!
Okay, here we go.
Get up, get up.
This is for you, Matthew.
This is for you, boy.
Oh yeah!
Oh shit!
Get her up here.
Shut her up.
No! No! No!
Hold her legs!
Oh my God.
I'll bash your fucking face in, bitch.
- Andy: Shut up.
- No no no!
That's for you.
Get your drawers off, Matthew.
- God damn it.
- Okay.
- Johnny: Here. Here.
- Storch: Get her panties off.
- I'll rip 'em off.
- No!
Yeah, get her.
- Johnny: Damn it, hold her still.
- Come on, retard.
- No! No!
- Hold her down!
- Stick your pee-pee in her.
- Okay!
Come on, Matt, get in here.
Get in there.
Johnny: Yeah!
Storch:
Get in there!
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
- Jennifer: Oh no!
Look at him go.
There's a gang-banger.
Johnny: Feels good, don't it, Matthew, pumping away on her? Get her legs.
Storch: Yeah, come on, son.
Come on, boy!
Deep. Get in deep.
Get in deep.
Deep deep deep deep!
- Deep!
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew.
Get over here.
Hey, put that thing down and get over here.
- Keep her quiet. Fucking gag her.
- Shut your fucking mouth!
Storch:
Gag her!
Johnny: Shut her up!
It feels good, don't it, Matthew?
Yeah yeah!
Keep her quiet now!
Hello, angel.
Daddy's on a call.
Girl:
Daddy, it's Sunday.
You always make breakfast before church.
I know, I know, sweetheart.
Daddy's real busy.
You tell mom I'm running late.
Okay.
Bye, Daddy.
Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
Yeah, Matthew!
He fill her up yet?
Johnny: Damn it. Oh shit!
You're the shit, Matthew.
You're getting your ass beat by a woman.
Johnny: Matthew, you better control that bitch.
Hold her down. Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah, boy.
Over there.
Over there.
Ain't that romantic?
You clean that shit up.
Make her do it.
Andy:
You heard him. Clean it up.
Hey, Matthew, get back here.
You all right, boy?
Stanley:
Oh man, this is so like my fantasy.
You can thank me later.
Andy: You calm down, boy.
You did all right, Matthew.
Jennifer: No no.
Please.
No.
No no.
You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch?
That shit hurts.
- Now take a look, honey.
- No.
I'll bet you're thirsty, huh?
Why don't you have a drink?
- Do it again!
- You like that? Let's have another one.
Hold her down.
Hold her head down.
All right, boys, that filly's got a few more races to run.
You like that, girl?
You like that sweet water, huh? Yeah.
You got some fight left in you, Miss Hills.
I like things rough.
Please. Please.
- Yeah.
- I'm sore.
Please.
I'm sore.
Don't worry now, sweetheart.
I'm an ass man.
No teeth, show horse.
No teeth.
Whoo!
Andy:
God damn, Stanley.
30 seconds.
Must be a new record for you, man.
That bitch was too tight.
Don't you know you're supposed to wait for the lady?
Stanley:
Shit, man, like she cares.
She's laying there like a dead fish.
Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.
Andy: Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna be the pussy today, huh?
Johnny: Don't know what you're bragging about, Andy.
Clocked you just over two minutes.
Andy:
It's been a while, man.
I'm out of practice.
It's been, I don't know, maybe 10 years.
Where you going?
God damn, she's got some fight in her.
Johnny:
Come on, let's chase.
Andy:
Where does she think she's going?
Well, it was fun while it lasted, Miss Hills.
Johnny: Shit!
Johnny:
Where is she?
Hell, she's gotta come up for air sometime.
Shit.
Stanley: Gators must have got her by now. Right, Sheriff?
Listen up.
Creek ends about six miles downstream in Watson.
Between here and there, we're gonna find her.
We split up.
We check the banks, in the timber, under rocks.
Hell, you see a hole big enough for her, I want you in there.
And do not stop till y'all find me a dead city whore.
Nothing.
Not a goddamn thing.
Now what?
Her body will show up one way or another.
Every day we're gonna check the ravine, from the bridge straight down through here and back.
Two shifts a day till we find something.
For how long?
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.
Burn it, all of it.
You hear me?
Yes sir.
You get her wheels down the shop.
Strip it down to its last goddamn nut.
That's gonna take two weeks.
All right, Sheriff, yeah.
I'll have Andy torch it out and I'll rub the numbers out.
Asshole!
The fuck you saving that for, you moron?
It's fucking evidence!
I shit you not!
I need you all on point for this.
And I mean goddamn fucking point.
We clear?
Now pony up.
We got shit to do.
Burn that effing tape.
Andy:
Well, that's all of it, right down to her little titty sling.
Man, this fire's making me hungry.
Well, there's a headline.
We gotta finish this shit.
We gotta get that car in the garage.
Then you can stuff your face till you puke.
Where the hell's Matthew at?
He ain't one to stay behind.
He was looking around the water like some crazed dog after a bone, man.
You keep an eye on him.
We gotta make sure he keeps it together, you hear me?
Just at least until this shit's over.
Gone all day,
I got nervous.
- Anything worth telling?
- Just the usual.
The mess they got on Highway 1 took forever.
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?
Daddy.
Got anything on the stove?
Sure, I'll reheat it.
You'll be proud.
Proud of what?
I was accepted to the honors program, Daddy.
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can.
I expect nothing less from my angel.
Mommy and I are proud of you.
I'm gonna shower up.
Every time I come in here this place gets worse.
Yeah, and business keeps getting better and better.
Mockingbird Trail.
Miss Hills.
She left?
She did indeed.
I couldn't make head nor tail of it.
I found empty cases of booze, marijuana cigarettes.
Crazy wild one.
She'd have made a preacher cuss.
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?
No refund policy.
Christmas come early.
Enjoy it.
Speaking of early, next month's quail season.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of shooting squirrels.
Me too.
- Woman: Thank you.
- Johnny: You have a pretty smile.
Did you just come here to see me?
Happy hour, boys.
Fuckin' A.
Here's to your mama.
I just want all this bullshit to be over.
No!
Woman: He's the big black guy in the red drawstring.
Man:
You're talking about the garbage man.
Woman:
Well, give the man a turkey.
- Hello.
- Earl: Yeah.
It's Earl.
- Earl.
- Yeah.
This woman leaves a message on the machine.
Barbara something or other.
Yeah, so?
She was asking about that Miss Hills.
Says no one's seen her in over a month.
Ain't that about the time she split?
Yeah.
Yeah, and you know the story.
I don't know.
I wasn't there.
I think you should call her back.
I mean, heck, Sheriff, you may have been the last one to see her.
Sheriff?
Okay, I'll call her.
Good.
You want the number?
No, it's late.
I'll get it from you in the AM.
We're still on for tomorrow, right?
Yeah, of course.
Everything all right?
Yeah, just fine.
It's gone!
Look at that.
Looks like someone spooked the cattle.
It's gone!
It's fucking gone!
Jesus, Stanley, calm the fuck down.
What's got your nuts in a sling?
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.
Maybe you accidentally ate it.
Fuck off, man, this is serious!
It had the tape in it.
What are you talking about?
The tape.
The fucking tape.
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.
I replaced it with a new one.
The Sheriff stomped on the one that had nothing on it.
You kept that tape, huh?
You kept that tape, you stupid piece of shit?
Come here.
You kept that tape?
- You kept that fucking tape?
- Please, Andy!
- Hey hey hey!
- What's wrong with you?
- How could you lose that fucking tape?
- Come on, man.
Come on.
Gotta stick together on this one.
You're too dumb to know how dumb you are.
You know that?
Uh-huh.
Is that right?
Is that right?
I better not find you, you little fucker.
All right.
All right, let's go.
Come on out, fucker.
Come on!
You think this shit's funny?
Andy?
Stanley?
Fucking pussies.
All right. All right.
That's it, God damn it.
Yeah, come on!
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Come on, fucker!
Come on out, fucker.
Oh shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Son of a bitch.
Sweetheart.
They're beautiful.
I've been so busy.
No need to explain.
You hadn't taken a single day off.
You're only human.
I guess.
Maybe you can help me with something while I put these in water.
Help with what?
I got this tape delivered, but it don't fit our machine.
What tape?
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.
Chastity see this?
No. Like I said, we couldn't get it to play.
Where is she?
She's sleeping. Why?
I'm gonna be back.
Where the hell you been?
Beauty queen over here doing his hair for two hours.
What's this all about, man?
- Where'd you get that?
- Where'd I get that?
Right there.
That's where I got that.
Somebody left me a present last night on my doorstep.
Jesus, man, Matthew!
Come on!
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.
No one knows where he's at.
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.
What?
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.
You wanna tell me why this was dropped off to my house?
To my wife!
What's on the tape?
Is this some kind of fucked up joke?
I smashed the damn thing myself!
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.
The one you smashed ain't got nothing on it.
You knew about this?
No, Sheriff,
I just found out about it myself.
Eat that tape, fat boy!
Fucking tape!
You think it's funny?
You screwed up, fat boy.
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.
I mean, dipshit there, he kept the tape as a souvenir, but Matthew's the one that took it, Sheriff.
Look at this. Silly bastard left me a present last night.
Andy:
He's obsessed with her, man.
I think he even feels guilty.
You dipshits bring him to me.
I'm gonna cut his retard pecker off and use it as a goddamn hood ornament.
That's before I'm done shoving it up your dirt hole.
Shit, we've been looking for him, Sheriff.
Trust me, we've been everywhere looking for him.
I want him found tonight.
Or I swear to Christ,
I'll bring the wrath of God down on you.
Can you believe there used to be a limit on quail?
Goddamn things are like locusts now.
Much to our good fortune.
I gotta take a break.
My dogs are barking something fierce.
I remember when you and my old man chased that buck out from the hollows on Stickler Farm before bagging it.
Aww. Them were the good old days.
To the good old days.
Well, fancy.
To what do I owe?
You just enjoy it.
This is some fine whiskey.
Usually you don't get something like this except at baptisms and weddings.
And funerals.
Loose ends, Earl.
Loose ends.
Jennifer: Matthew.
I'm over here.
Jennifer:
Matthew.
Matthew.
I- I knew- knew you were alive.
I knew it.
How did you know, Matthew?
Huh?
How did you know
I was alive?
Are you sure you're not dreaming?
Am I?
Am I dreaming?
Come here.
Sit with me.
I need to tell you-
Shh!
I know, Matthew.
I know this wasn't your fault.
You tried to help me.
I did.
I really really did.
And- and- and you're okay.
You're- you're okay.
Yes, Matthew.
Now come.
Come on.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

Oh God!
I'm so sorry.
Matthew.

You're only making it harder on yourself, Matt.
Boo!
Stupid fuck, what the hell's wrong with you?
Whoo!
Fucker's playing your song.
Andy:
Your ass is grass, Matthew.
Stanley:
Matthew, you're a dead man.
Whoo!
- Come on, man.
- I'm gonna kill him.
Don't you pass out on me.
I'm too tired to drag your ass back.
What the hell?
Matthew?
Stanley:

God damn it, Matthew, where are you?
Where are you, you little fucker?
Andy, he ain't out here.
You little bitch.

Matthew, this shit ain't funny, boy.
Somebody help me!
Jennifer: Smile real pretty for the camera, boy.
Andy: Please!
I know you like to watch, don't you?
Don't you, you sick fuck?
Don't worry,
I'll give you quite a show.
Andy:
Matthew!
Matthew!
- Here you go.
- Stanley!
You remember this?
Stanley, help me!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Can't talk, can you?
Maybe it's because you're hungry.
You know, you gotta eat a lot of nasty shit out here to stay alive.
Are you hungry?
You hungry?
What's wrong?
You don't like it?
What are you doing?
Some fishing.
I know how you guys like to fish.
Don't blink.
Andy:
You okay, Stan?
How's it going?
I'm sorry.
Please!
Please is what I said to you.
You said...
"Suck it, bitch. "
Does that ring any bells?
Suck... it... bitch!
Be right back.
Wait, come back.
Come back here.
Come back here.
Andy: Stanley!
I'm gonna fucking kill you, you bitch.
Hi.
You like the show so far?
Andy:
Let me out of here!
Wait.
It gets better.
Please, my eyes.
I can't take it anymore.
Oh, let me help you.
Let me out!
Stanley!
Please.
Please.
Please. Please.
That might feel better.
Andy:
Help!
Huh-uh-uh, now don't drown too soon.
Fuck you.
Now is that any way to talk to a lady?
I'm impressed.
You got a lot of fight in you.
Let's see how you do now.
What's that?
It's just some lye
I found laying around.
No!
Let's see how long you can keep that pretty little face of yours.
Fuck you!
You already did that.
I didn't enjoy it much.
Now it's my turn to fuck you.
- Please. Please.
- Oh.
Please.
Pain in the ass.
Good morning.
Whoo.
Hey there.
Can I fill you up?
It's date night.
Your mouth doesn't look so good.
Maybe you should show me your teeth.
I'll kill you.
Ornery stallion.
Guess I'm gonna have to tame you.
See, that's the problem.
You still have some teeth left.
I'm gonna have to take care of that.
Huh? Huh?
No fucking teeth, show horse.
No fucking teeth!
Better save your strength
'cause you got a few more races left to run, show horse.
That is disgusting.
Even your boys didn't piss themselves.
Look who's here.
It's my boyfriend.
Remember him?
Why don't you give him a little kiss?
Hmm? Hmm?
Let's go, come on.
I don't take orders from no fucking woman.
No?
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.
Just like it was your first time, remember?
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Let me tell you something:
You know, you weren't even a good blowjob.
No.
You know what they do to horses that can't be tamed, Johnny?
You geld them.
No teeth, show horse.
No teeth.
Bitch!
Hey, sweetheart.
- Chastity's new teacher's here.
- Storch: Mrs. Novick?
No, from the honors program.
- Do you remember anything?
- Oh yeah, that's right.
- I'm real busy, sweetheart.
- Hey, Daddy.
Hello, angel.
Daddy's real busy working.
But I really want you to meet my new teacher.
She's way cool.
Here. Just say hi.
Howdy, Sheriff.
It's truly an honor to speak with you, Miss...
Hills, Jennifer Hills.
Excuse me?
I have to tell you it's been a pleasure meeting your family.
You have a wonderful daughter with a bright and promising future.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.
No, wait!
Shit!
Chastity, where is she?
She went to Hanson Park with Miss Hills.
She wanted to get to know her students in the program before the year st-
God damn it!
Who is she?
Who is this woman?
Chastity!
Chastity!
Where are you, angel?
Chastity!
Oh no! No!
Please!
No.
Help me, Jesus.
Does that hurt, Sheriff?
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.
Where is she, you bitch?
I'd be real careful how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.
What have you done to her?
By her, I assume you mean your daughter?
She really is lovely, Sheriff.
So young.
So sweet.
So innocent.
I mean, can you imagine?
Imagine what?
Imagine that somebody had done something like this to her.
Someone like Andy.
Or Stanley or Johnny.
Or more likely you, you sick, perverted rapist!
- Deep deep deep!
- Fuck!
Deep! Deep!
Deep! Deep! Deep!
Jesus fucking Jesus.
Please.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
She's just an innocent girl.
So was I.
What are you doing? What?
Matthew.
You won't get a- fucking-way with this.
You won't get away with this!
He'll be waking up soon.
If I were you,
I'd tell him not to move.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm a God-fearing person.
I got-
I've got a baby coming, please.
Please, I'm begging you.
We can figure something out.
Sorry, Sheriff.
It was fun while it lasted.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, please.
I'm begging you to help me.
Please help me.
I've got a wife and family.
Ma'am, please!
You fuck!
You fuck!
You fuck!
Where are you going, you fuck?
I'll see you in hell!
I'll rape you in hell!
You're just a piece of meat.
I'll find you.
I'll hunt you down in hell, you bitch!
- Matthew.
- Sheriff?
- Matthew, no.
- Sheriff.
Matthew!

YELLOWBRICKROAD (2010)
 One morning in 1940, ran the entire population of Friar ...
 north, over a mountain trail in the wilderness. 
 Most of them were frozen to death.
Some were brutally massacred. 
But most were never recovered. 
In this confidential information is a sound recording of a survivor ...
 performed prior of this study. 
In office 8 reported at 11.00 
 on October 10, 1940. 
 File: 63708NA90 
Subject  is the last citizen, and sole survivor of the missing. 
 provided at 257. 
 This case needs further study.
Gentlemen. Thank you. 
 Sir, how is it that you are the only surviving are 
I walked  ...
- You're the only survivor. Why?
 "Everybody else dead ...
"I could not ...'
 "I left them behind ... the path ...'
Subject  holds his hands over his ears and pain. Mr. ...
 What you heard?
- I heard ...
 What you heard, sir?
Mr. 
Do not you hear?
Do not you hear?
Am I the only one here?
 No sir, I'm here. 
I'm not too late, right?
- About two minutes we close.
Thank God.
You are here for Friar  New
Hampshire, the old way. 
Yes.
Two forms of
Photo identification, if you want. 
 Mr. Barnes, you're asking,
There are certainly people ...
 who would rather not have. 
I understand that.
I have full confidence in you that my collection of letters ... will add to the gray in the public domain.
 You should be thinking more positive,
Mr. Barnes. 
 All for you The file, photographs, and songs. 
Oh, my God.
- In addition ...
 I want to apologize for all these years of discomfort with your wife and you 
 Even if you do not really need. 
But I do.
 I will give you some photos, Mr. Barnes. 
Excuse me ...
Hello?
We drink.
You drink.
You will now no classes, Teddy.
So drink.
Pour into well but, Walter.
Besides, the general view is if you can not do what you like ... you than resorting to education.
Except that I did not know where I was going, that's what happened.
And that's why we drink.
I will really miss.
I do not know what to do.
What if we look at drinking we throw everything out the window?
And work for what it is.
The Walters is staying here.
What if we do another book?
He has it.
- No, he does not.
In some ways it is real.
 Mr. and Ms. Barnes, this is Jerry Abbott from Hampshire. 
We just want to pass that your request has been through. 
 I can not say that people here there are very enthusiastic about. 
The Ranger will  arrangements.
He will no firearms with them. 
 And you better not. 
 Good luck with the trip. 
 Who the hell do you think you are? 
 Stay away 
 Do not come here.
We do not talk to you. 
 We come here to help people like you to avoid, transfer it. 
Here you will be afraid of?
In a good way.
Would you be disappointed if you go there and ... with a clear story and pictures of a few bones?
Yes.
I was very disappointed.
Just like me.
I love you, Bellamy.
I've already told you?
I love you more.
Well, day one: not very difficult.
Today we pack up and leave.
We want at noon in the path.
As many field studies before dark.
Why do not yet summer camp and we do the consultation here.
I'll go first. I'm Melissa Barnes and do this regularly ... and put the compass in the field.
I'm Cy Banbridge, forest service,
They have asked me ... but it seems unnecessary.
Daryl Luger, I am reader.
- Luger Erin, we are readers.
There are no new maps of the north added since the turn of the century so ...
So apparently we are lucky.
Is that so, Cy.
- That's us.
Michelle Bateman,
Teddy and Melissa's intern.
Jill has the kit with them so they can take care of the blisters.
Trent and painkillers.
Walter Myrick, I give behavioral psychology.
I'll do some testing day and captured with this camera.
But you know, no stress,
Just as normal as possible.
It's still early I know, but ...
I make enough.
Teddy Barnes, co-author.
Photographer, that's clear.
The story of the Friar fascinates me.
I'm not sure we all will find answers.
But I can tell you that we blessed that we get a chance ... a legend, able to establish a history.
Pancakes.
Hey.
 I'm going to a few questions and want you to honestly answer, right? 
 not think too much, is that right?
- Great, but ask your questions.
 What is your name?
- I have already ..
 I see, Cy Banbridge. 
 What are you here? 
 Arkinlot.
- Good enough.
What  smell you associate with the color red?
- You're definitely a joke?
 Cherry, I cherry. 
 What does that mean?
- That you have no brain damage.
Here.
- You keep him with you.
Here, this way.
- Here?
According to this, and the coordinates that you should have given it here.
That thing is broken.
These coordinates are correct.
- Do you see a path somewhere then?
We are looking for a mountain path.
Are you a bunch of backward walking, or something? For you are in a cinema.
Hey, wait a minute.
- Fuck you.
Tickets are eight dollars,
So 56 of you together.
So you go watch a movie?
Hey, you're awesome.
Forward, this is not happening.
We're outta here.
What are we looking?
Something with guns, tits, and the end of the world.
Nobody wants to talk to us.
It's good. I am not one of the evil, just jealous.
Why?
- Because you can walk down the road.
Only we can not, for there is no path, right?
The coordinates were false, in one way or another ... they lead us here, why we are here
Now go run like motherfuckers.
Has anyone ordered to not to talk to us?
My grandfather has worried me this job.
He has been the owner for a while, until
He died of throat cancer last year.
He was friends with the owner.
That was before everyone walked away.
- Your grandfather was here in 39, 40?
To houthaktripjes weekend, yes.
I have to change the coil.
- Wait a minute.
I am a movie star and become now paid.
Reach right down on the back.
Left over from the past:
"Gone With The Wind" original print.
That's half the Oz movie.
Who was stuck in the projector.
He plays it no longer, it is worn touched by all the times playing.
Hey, I did not say you could use me as a source, right?
I do not have much money.
- You have something much better, an expedition.
Listen!
- You take me in the leg.
I walk my own stuff,
I can cook.
I can tell you everything
I know the book.
I have no real family anymore, no money to go to the South.
Please, you must take me.
- I appreciate it, but you're not listening.
There is no path.
There is no journey.
But there is a path.
Have you seen it?
- There is even a marker.
Stone.
It says 'yellow brick road' on.
We drink it now and then, when we are afraid.
I have the first 100 meters once walked.
YELLOW BRICK ROAD
 What is your full name
- Ann Liliane Luger.
 I want you to talk Jibbrisch until I say you should stop. 
 Ann, stop it.
- Okay.
 Without looking at your watch
Can you tell me what time it is? 
 15.17 hours.
- Well done.
 Two times two is four.
Four times four is eight. 
 Two times eight is sixteen. 
 Sixteen times two is thirty-two. 
 Thirty-two times two is sixty-four. 
Sixty-four times two is one hundred twenty-eight. 
Another hour.
You could break your wrist again, that would be nice.
Only one hour, right?
Indian cucumber,
Count on them but, they are tasty.
Cool.
How do you feel now?
 a bit excited, full of insects, but otherwise great. 
Make  ongoing movement, until I say stop. 
 I'm not finished.
- I said stop. Thank you. 
 Count prime numbers, start at two. 
Two, three.
Five, seven.
Eleven, thirteen. Seventeen ... nineteen, twenty-three.
- Fantastic. Stop.
I won the Olympics for fastest lighter four years in a row.
Summer Camp Olympics, of course.
- Fastest lighter?
How do you do that?
You tie a rope 18 cm above the ground ... and the first who, by through fire, wins.
18 inches? Child's play.
I do it twice as fast, at least.
Hey, Cy!
Moose are dangerous?
Yes, with moose mess, for sure.
I have seen how someone on the horns took him and threw 15 meters far.
If that's all you are worried about.
I do not hate bears.
A bear kills a lot more than a moose.
Yes, but it's the horns,
I'm not on the horns.
Hey, guys.
Give to me.
- Give me that.
One, two ...
Cy?
- You want to trade? Lollipop, lollipop.
Stop!
No one moves.
Grab your soul!
- Asshole!
How do you get that?
- Just found.
In the woods when I had to pee.
I almost slipped on the leaves.
Have you peed on?
- Very out mid thirties.
Someone takes the piss us.
- Look at the label.
You chased me the meaning of fear.
- Wait, look.
Impossible for this hat
70 years is located here.
Maybe someone lost it.
At this time.
Someone close.
- So my spine.
Nice try, but that's wrong.
We should keep him well.
- Can I put it on?
Why would you want to put it on?
I do not know, it seems best good way to keep the hat.
Of course.
Wait a minute.
Do not do it with the hat.
Your name?
- Melissa Barnes.
Where are you now?
- On the path. We are on the path.
 How do you feel?
- Well, actually good.
 Occasionally some pain in the stomach, but otherwise ...
 What do you associate with the color blue? 
ammonia or chlorine might as in a pool. 
Congratulations, or something.
- I'll see you at the camp.
So, fall in October 1940.
- Yes. and that would be about 15 ...
And Roosevelt gave no any attention to the woods.
Nobody does that.
People lose hope ... and spend all their time and I mean all their time in the bios.
Sitting staring as gnomes.
- And in the Emerald City.
Indeed.
- How about the official records?
Was the only credible of myself. So I went to Friar.
To see for yourself.
Spoke with a staff member.
What did you think?
They have not left everything behind.
Only the stuff they took.
 Not the things you would expect. 
 He said the evening dress was gone. 
 hats, costumes and other things. 
Melissa told us that only after we took the hats.
He thought we  music it had taken. 
 On one of his old photos that he attended the creek came back we just left 
It's amateurish, that's ridiculous.
Just wait until we're sure.
If you say ...
Idiots.
Coordinate 5 at 11.9 degrees to the northwest.
Coordinate 6 at 7.01 degrees to the northwest.
Coordinator: are you ready?
- Go on.
Coordinate seven is 62 degrees, it is now the North.
Eight?
Demonstrate eyes, I have to recalibrate.
It tastes still nowhere.
Take that hat off.
I mean it.
What?
- A problem.
Have you made it much?
 This is Teddy, do you hear me? 
We are over.
 GPS indicates that we are Quam over. 
What did you say about?
 Whatever.
Over and out. 
Intern, where did we get here?
Forty miles northwest of Florence.
Would be a Tide Mill.
Far away.
Wind tunnel.
Natural amphibian theater, anyone?
 Hey, Jill the intern, where are we now? 
Just outside Melbourne.
Hello  Melborne.
The dingo took my baby 
Object  four, this is day three.
First memory that comes to mind. 
 My first cat, Reddy. 
Remember how  sounded Reddy
- Yes.
 Can you imitate that sound?
- Should I meow?
 Yes. 
Stop the engine!
I've heard.
- I heard it too.
Oh, my God, oh my God,
Oh, my God, oh my God,
Oh, my God, oh my God.
 Theories, a: solar flares, egomorfologie and magnetism. 
Two : human presence.
As Cy suggested. 
That we  thwarted by the FBI. 
 Three: selective hallucination. 
We  the psychosis as if it were a disease. Maybe far-fetched. 
But Daryl  and Walter's work with indicate the noise levels on ...
That the  the end of the road. 
 Four: they are the people of the Friar.
- They are the "runners."
 In some ways they appear. 
 This is what we know: "We're not crazy '
Our instruments  store stampedes.
We are five days away 
 from civilization with luggage. 
Three  no. 
So here we are, this meeting is officially ... the ability to go back.
What?
No, no, you can not be serious.
For I am the one who proposes to return.
None of your theories explain the music.
How do you explain the music?
How can we all crazy,
I do not understand that.
They listened to this music.
Over and over again,
My grandfather told me that himself.
You saw the film reels, they were addicted to.
Wait, take it easy.
Jill, the intern said something funny and I want more info.
Intern, repeat, please.
- Ikabi, never mind.
God!
Theory five, "The act of God. "
- This is really ridiculous.
What if the population of Friar assumed that this ...
"The way to God. "
A magician, or something to stop the war.
You can always magician ask for something, right?
Anything?
- No!
Because if you was old enough to remember
The magician is a little bald dictator.
Everyone must make its voice heard.
- Can you please stop it?
I think we do not know what going on here and we should go.
I'm afraid.
I think we should consider both.
- But Walter ...
If there is an end, and there is something or someone, what would you ask?
This is a very personal question.
What is your answer, Mr. Barnes?
- Ask him to smile at the camera.
That's all I need.
We both go.
- We do not know where North is.
I call Northeast North.
17 degrees.
How did you do that?
Your sister said you tools not do well.
Yes, but I do.
That's the North.
You can almost map-reading, or you're not so good?
I'm too good.
It's a triple magnetic force ... in the opposite direction, as
They flush toilets in Australia.
Leads to the center?
- Yes.
I think it comes from the music.
- Jill, I want to coordinate.
Just like us.
- We have not yet.
We have to go south.
Okay, start preparing.
- I'm working on it.
What is your full name?
- Liv Michelle McCann.
Should I look at you or the camera?
- Look into the camera.
 Where is you now? 
Daryl said we  100 km
In Yellow Brick Road are. 
 We hear the music since yesterday morning. 
 Say the alphabet backwards. 
 Z, y, x, w, v, u, 
 ... t
- That's enough.
 No, let me finish. 
 V, u, t, s, r, 
 Q, p, n, m, I, 
 Damn!
What was there again for L 
 L, k, j. .. 
 i, h, j, f. .. 
 e, d, c, b, a. 
There's another one.
Another intersection, people.
What are you talking about?
- What do you think?
I'm not going back.
Not going back.
- I'm not going back.
Your little heart goes so fast again.
It is not small.
 I think this is already the slope. 
You're not where you are supposed to be about.
Daryl, I know this should be fun ... but it is not.
Take the hat off.
 How do you feel now? 
 I feel hondsmoe. 
 talk in Hebrew until I say you can stop. 
Well  stop. 
Repeat until the gesture
I say you can stop. 
 Teddy 
It's pretty good.
- Get your arm off me.
I was just ...
I missed the music.
That's all.
Where it remained.
When it comes back?
We've heard it before, you miss it?
No.
What did you see on the tapes?
- No, it's different for everyone.
It's like separations, delays, association, memory loss.
So many people forget the way back.
Daryl has the coordinates clearly written down.
I'm not talking about the way home.
I'm on the way back to the beginning.
Who we were when we started.
- We are here, Walter.
We are passed.
I'm sure.
We have enough for the book.
It's not about the book, but for you. You always try ... things to get you not even understand. You do not see.
And this time it drives me really afraid.
Why?
- Do you see this?
Look carefully.
Go on, everybody.
Poisonous berries.
Atropa belladona.
Night Shade.
Make sure you can keep them apart.
Dangerous and poisonous berries.
I ate him up.
I pressed him fine.
It does not seem dangerous berry.
- Dangerous and poisonous berries.
You know what?
We have earned a celebration.
Okay, but look good,
I mean it.
The fastest lighter, so.
This will really happen.
Somebody get me some in the glass.
 Put it on fire.
- Do not let it go out.
 Burn it.
- Do not let it go out.
 Jesus
- Ten times closer than I thought.
 Why do not we have a smooth in case someone is cheating? 
 These are questions for the magician, ask him that. 
 There are things ...
 I do not want to see. 
 What are you talking about, it's good. 
 I eat things.
- They look like hallucinations.
 We should know.
- There's no place like home.
 There is no place like home ...
- Guys.
Let me, I want to sleep.
I lied.
That's different, yes.
I never knew my grandfather.
He lived in Maine.
But I am grown up in Friar.
Go to sleep now.
You should have known.
All that gevraag why they went on the road.
The people of Friar questions is not it.
If you live there you understand.
It's not something you a book about writing.
 The first thing I asked Jill morning was a childhood memory. 
 She told me that it the end of the Yellow Brick Road was. 
We achieve the end of the day, right?
We take the hint?
- Give her one day.
A day.
Wait a minute.
We must take sides.
Argo and take the bowl behind us?
No, we wait.
Come on.
Everyone, this 15 minutes ensure that we can continue.
Your fingerprints are everywhere.
- "Your fingerprints are everywhere."
You know, you look out lousy.
Is it damaged?
- No.
You have damaged the lamp.
- No.
Is it damaged?
- No.
Take the hat off.
- Is it damaged?
Put that damn hat, I mean it.
Take that hat off.
Give it to me. Take it off and give it to me.
Shut up and do the hat.
Take off!
If you do not alter ...
Daryl, no!
He heads for the trees.
- Let me see.
Stay there and be quiet.
Jill, walk away. We walked ...
- What have you seen Walter?
It killed her. Tore her to pieces.
- Why?
They had a fight about that hat.
What?
Walter, what happened?
Listen to me all.
Eric is dead.
- Yes.
There is a terrible tragedy happened.
Walter, you and I set up an emergency camp here, and Teddy and Cy ... take the knife and collect whatever you can.
Go find him.
- We just go home.
Daryl knows the way to go home.
- He has done it often enough.
He has no book.
If we can find the way home.
I can find our way.
I agree with Cy.
Let the music stop!
- Scaremongering.
Get him back.
Seven.
Let it go and find him.
- No ...
No, we do not.
Melissa.
Melissa?
- What?
Forget it.
- What is it, Jo?
I wondered if I had a candy bar should have.
Well, I get it all.
It's pretty good.
It's all right, Jill. Teddy and Sarah
Daryl get back and then we go home.
Do you believe me?
- I believe you.
I do not.
I water and some help, right?
We need to merge and Mark, right?
We can not leave.
- We go back.
What are you looking?
- Something bright to the body marking.
Liz is not alone.
- I do not care.
They go through Aaron.
Did you go see him this way?
- I think so.
But I do not know what I saw.
Oh God, let it stop.
It seems it's doing that on purpose.
- Sure, instant.
Did you know?
- I saw it too.
I saw it.
Turn that thing off.
Daryl?
Daryl, give me answers.
We know you're there.
- Hello?
 Guys, I think
I've done something really awful. 
We know.
We know, and it's good.
 I hurt my leg. 
We will help you, come here it's good.
Daryl, I want you to good
I listen.
 You're not in trouble. 
 I know. 
It seems like no one will forgive you.
But you did wrong.
Anyone who loves you will forgive you.
We thought it all that he says, but then again not, Daryl.
I ...
I thought it all day long, we all.
I thought about killing him.
I thought so too, Daryl.
Can you not just leave? 
 That you can not, do you? 
Maybe we should get him.
- No, no, no. It is not necessary.
I'm coming.
- That's good.
That's right, Daryl, thanks.
 I just tie a rope around your hands. 
 This is a security measure, right? 
Yes. That's better.
That's it.
Okay, Daryl.
- Tie me up.
Now.
I love him for a while in the holes.
I feel my hands.
- I do not care.
Tie the rope to loosen.
I have questions about the coordinates.
- Do you like music, Teddy?
Music has never been my thing.
But that song ...
That song starts to get me in his power.
Begins in his power to get you?
I hear the people and the music.
I hear those who have walked the path.
- The coordinates.
I can not our home.
- You can believe me, you.
Look at the pages, Teddy.
I mean, look.
Yesterday morning at 48.3 miles Pedo Meter ... and it turned out to be 29.2 miles adding the coordinates when we ... and went to the South.
The next morning
We at 8.45 of the camp
8.2 miles from Pedo meter, while
There were 19 miles out.
We looked at three miles further back, and we saw the camp on the scope not even.
The coordinates are correct, otherwise you would have said anything, Aaron had said something.
No, if you follow the yellow brick road
The coordinates are difficult.
They count on, it becomes clear as you go along.
That's exactly how we make choices by moving forward.
Looking back is a different story.
Looking back, looking at page to page.
The whole country is like ... liquid.
- Show me how it works.
Look on the last page.
So you come to the end of the path, Teddy.
Think it on.
What does he do?
- I do not know, maybe nothing.
I hear a pattern.
- You're kidding.
We can not make it disappear?
You talk too much.
- Go away.
Please, get out.
Useless.
That's the way home.
He wrote it down.
- Stay tuned!
Daryl was an analyst, so the coordinates are all arranged.
No, it is there.
This is the way back, here it is,
He wrote it down.
I swear to God ...
- You do not.
None of you know me.
You do not even look at me.
- Okay, it's good.
He left behind some equipment, but we can survive, trust me.
Lady, do you make a joke?
Oh, I am now a "lady"
- Yes, you.
You have even forgotten my name?
- Take it easy.
Do not say that to me.
- Keep your hands off me.
Another reason why we a word from you to listen?
Because everything comes true.
Teddy and I have to
Siberia looked in the desert.
It means nothing.
What is your plan?
- She did not.
We must stay together, eating ration and drinking, and then we go.
Not on the path. Let the path dislocate.
To the south. We leave tomorrow morning.
We have the stuff is not it?
- No.
As I see it we go to the west.
- West?
I know there is nothing in the East and even less in the North, but the West.
It's a better chance.
Maybe we come against them in Vermont.
I'm not very comfortable.
- You have had the chance to talk.
I am talking.
- Bullshit.
Want a reason?
I have a reason that it matters!
I have this knife!
That distinction, I do not take our roads.
I can make a way through the wilderness, can kill a beast ... or a complete fool with my machete ... in an off-road driving.
I'm not wait until tomorrow.
I want to know what Teddy think of it.
I think we're heading north must go further.
Really? It is not an option.
No further north.
Think we should go home with answers.
These questions cost us our lives.
These questions were never asked.
It does not matter anyway.
He's fine.
He fell, but there's nothing wrong.
We go to the south.
Liv and I go to the west tonight, with or without you.
I'm going to personally kill. but ...
This does not die with you ... anyway because they are denied.
And I do not belong to of a democracy now ...
I promise you.
We need to distribute the stuff.
Take the flashlight.
This is ours. The flashlight ... is yours.
And the water?
- I need you.
That we also need.
Do not let this happen.
We must stand guard.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Thomas, he is too far away.
Thomas, they see us,
Please stay with me.
Where are you, I do not feel?
- I'm here.
Near you.
- That's better.
I dreamed that we arrived home but it was no longer there.
It's good.
- It was gone.
The grass was black and sky filled with smoke.
And I was there but I was dead.
Everyone was dead and gone.
And I was really scared.
It was the worst time
I woke up because ... what if this path is now our home?
Focuses on three properties and make sure you keep a straight line.
You're doing fine, really.
Here.
No.
- Take it. I catch a squirrel later.
Why do not darker than this?
- I do not know.
Are we ever head north?
- You can forget.
Dangerous berries.
Yes.
Not eat them.
I've tried.
I am not died, but ...
You get get high.
- Is that so?
Really really stupid thing to do.
Too much poison, and you get in a daze.
I love this song great!
I think it's beautiful, really beautiful.
I want to walk.
No, no, too dangerous.
We stay here.
Can I touch your hair?
- Okay.
Are you sure we can not walk?
A few more kilometers.
Oh, my God, look!
A squirrel.
Have you eaten?
- I did.
I pressed it a few fine on've tasted.
How it tasted.
- Bloody.
Yes, it is.
I'll kiss you, that's good right?
No.
Really?
- No, Cy.
It was North Dakota.
I do not?
Then we have that woman bribe to let the dogs.
She would not give for this trip.
Teddy had hives and hives received from the hot tub.
I believe it.
Mickey will soon die.
Lilian also it is unreliable.
They will not notice that we do not have come home.
He sits there for days crying in the dark.
Stop it, Teddy ...
He'll be fine.
We are now on their way home.
Here, do not listen to.
But take it.
These are good.
Ms. Taylor?
Pacman picked up,
Christmas was good.
Third grade, Ms. Scott.
Channel hairy.
I can check a box in one week.
I love Bradly, but he does not know.
I think I love him.
Let's see if I can find the way back.
Holidays in Cape Corn.
I love the beach.
Are you ...
What?
Are you angry ... on me?
No.
It's just hard.
Can you help me?
How?
To summarize it all.
We walk right now.
We walk seems like an eternity.
Yes.
- But that's not true.
We were part of a group people who walked to the North.
Because we wondered why
Another group went to the North.
We are all ever born and we all die.
We have done many things in between.
Like this.
Sometimes we have a job.
Like you had a job.
And your job was walking down this road.
I lived alone and sold popcorn.
And I lied because I knew it.
I think I have always known.
If you live in a city long enough you know the real reason why you are walking.
Just as I feel your eyes are focused on me, while I can not even be seen.
You always know that the path is there.
Everyone knows the and nobody says.
You're ashamed because it can be.
A way out.
You feel that the path you will understand.
I think that's the worst.
That it does.
Tomorrow we reach the mountains are.
Hey guys, check this out.
Not really.
Have you already had all the time?
We need to distribute the food.
- And no one yet knows.
Please?
We are on rations, okay?
We still have a long way to go.
I'm sorry.
I was so hungry.
I'm sorry!
 It happens to me. 
What has happened to Daryl?
Go to sleep now.
- No.
As the music continues, and we do not quickly find a village ...
I'm something unspeakable with you.
Like what?
I thought of kilometers ago.
All those things I'm doing.
I thought about suicide, but ...
If I was going to cut somewhere in that I would get confused.
Grab the rope, honey.
Teddy?
Sign up, Teddy.
Bastard!
This is the song, right?
This is a fluke.
- It calls me.
Do not leave me.
I do not.
Walter ...
How did you find anybody?
I can not answer that.
So you're our best friend been with Teddy and me ...
In all these years?
Is not that amazing?
Everything changes when you are deep in your heart think you tomorrow maybe die.
Are you sure?
Yes.
However small, these trees are.
I can go beg in the end, but you should just work.
Do not like the others, am not trying to persuade.
I do not talk anymore.
Do I stabbing you down?
- No.
No, I want my blood on that knife.
What do you want?
You have to break my neck.
I do not know how.
You take down my neck, and turns.
I'm not strong enough.
- Yes, you are, anyone can.
But I do not.
- Somewhere inside you can.
You must find your place in that it can.
Sorry Liz, but find the place that it wants to do.
Not stop!
Please, oh, God.
Walter!
Walter ...
I'm sorry, view the recording.
 Melissa, I hope you forgive me. 
 I've seen too much. 
 It's time for me to go. 
 I know you really not want to see, it's just that 
 the timeline I know ...
 I know you're here with me. 
 Thus ...
 Stay with me. 
Do not look away . 
 What's your name? 
 My name is Walter. 
 How do you feel now? 
 lot better. 
 My earliest memories as a child ...
 over the bars of my bed to climb 
 to get out. 
 talk in Hebrew ...
 Say ...
Stop . 
Stop . 
Stop . 
Stop . 
Where have you landed?
Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy, can you hear me?
Leave me here alone.
I'm trapped here and do not ...
I do not ...
If you had to go ...
If you had to go ...
Then you had me that morning awake to make.
I had gone with you.
Melissa.
I want you to know I'm here.
Where?
- In the cave behind you.
Going on the run?
I would not run for you.
Why not?
With my sore leg I
You might have a chance.
Will you kill me?
Here? Now?
Yes.
Please, Daryl.
Should it do so much?
Yes.
Here we go.
Melissa, are you there?
I heard you on a
Somehow ...
If you hear me, maybe ...
I'm somewhere on the map
I do not know.
I can not read the coordinates ...
I can not trust the coordinates.
You think it ... but the trick is that no an end to it.
But here's the wind.
Melissa ...
Are you there?
Are you asleep?
You lie somewhere to sleep without me?
I hope you like the way home find.
Where it's hot ... and waiting for you.
I hope you give us
Life can still remember.
I hear the music now.
And you will be at Walter ...
Walter will be happy too.
Do not think back to Brian.
Imagine never where I am.
And let no one a liar.
And one day ..
One day you will not more of me thinking ...
Not even for me to curse.
I have loved you.
Go home.
Help.
Someone ...
Am I the only one here?
No, sir, I am also.
Who are you?
- I play the movies, of course.
You must help me ...
Please, listen to me.
Listen to me.
- I listen!
There are others.
- Yes.
I need help finding them.
You must understand, I left them behind.
They no longer need your help.
How do you know?
- Because I've seen.
Is that so?
Please ...
What happened to her?
Oh, Ms. Barnes?
I've just seen her.
Did you know?
Is she here?
Is it the end?
Indeed, sir, she has reached the end.
But there are so many ends ...
Enjoy your movies, Mr. Barnes.
Sit down, sir!
Teddy  ...
 This is our house. 
 The grass is black. 
 And the air dirty. 
 All men are gone. 
 This is our home ...
 This is our home. 
<b> Thanks for watching!</b>
131 to dispatch, come in.
Hey hey hey hey!
131, this is dispatch. Go ahead.
This is 131.
We have a male, mid-50s,
with burns over 9% to 9.5% of his body.
Prior to our arrival on scene, patient apparently doused his head,
neck and face with some sort of highly-concentrated acid.
The patient's airway is severely compromised due to fume inhalation.
Vital signs unstable.
Please advise- patient is a criminal suspect.
We're coming in with a police escort right now.
Hi.
Can I talk to him?
He can't actually talk.
All right.
Jesus.
Can I just have a few minutes with him?
We want to know who you are.
We'll find out, you know, sooner or later.
So just save us some legwork by communicating with us now.
Are you a Satanist?
Are you involved in some kind of cult?
'Cause if there's others involved, we'll get them.
We'll find them, believe me.
What's the matter?
Is that it?
That's it, right?
Is there somebody you want to tell me about?
I'm sorry, the nurse at reception downstairs is on the phone.
She wants to talk to you, says it's urgent.
Okay.
I'll be right back, okay?
Thank you very much...
Yeah.
...Reverend Clergy all,
Senator Hawkins...
His daughter?
When was this?
Is she still here?
Well, did she leave any information, a phone number?
What do you mean a little girl?
How little?
Dispatch, this is Baker 17.
I'm gonna need a medical backup.
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.
Somebody help!
There is sin and evil in the world, and we're enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might.
Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil with which it must deal.
The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past.
Alexis de Tocqueville put it eloquently after he had gone on a search for the secret of America's greatness and genius-
"Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the greatness and the genius of America."
America is good.
And if America ever ceases to be good-
Eat some now, save some for later
Eat some now, save some for later
Now & Later
The really tasty ones
Now & Later
For all-day children's fun
Look at all those pieces...

- Flavors, oh they're wild
Eat some now, save some for later, eat some now, save some for later...
- Owen!
- What?
Dinnertime, honey.
Bless us O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive.
Please guide and direct us through all our days and protect us from evil.
Amen.
So how was school today?
You didn't go and spoil your dinner on me now, did you, Owen?
No.
- Owen, sweetie-
- No, I didn't.
Eat, please, honey.
Hello.
What?
Look, I'm not gonna discuss this now, okay?
We're eating dinner.
We had an agreement, John.
I think maybe you'd better call my lawyer, okay?
Don't talk to me like that!
I will not be spoken to in that way.
...Judgment to fall.
And if we as a people turn back to God...
These are the young people.
The young people are beginning to turn back to God
Who's waiting on them.
If the Lord calls you, then the Word comes.
And the Word came from the Lord...
Hey little girl.
Are you a little girl?
Huh?
Are you scared?
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes
And dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin'
On the radio
Let's sway while color lights up your face...
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
- Stop!
- How's it going?
Stop it. Mr. Zoric.
Okay, Kenny, 10 laps now.
I didn't do anything.
Now!
Or I'll make it 20.
Hey little girl.
Ow! Don't.
Are you a little girl?
Ow.
That's why he won't go swimming.
He doesn't want everyone to see what a little fucking girl he is.

Turning Japanese,

I really think so...
Is that gonna be it?
Turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so...
Are you scared?
Are you scared, little girl?
Huh?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You- you guys just moved in, huh, upstairs?
How do you know?
I live next door to you.
Right there.
Just so you know,
I can't be your friend.
Why not?
That's just the way it is.
Well, who said I wanted to be your friend?
Idiot.
Eat some now, save some for later
Eat some now, save some for later...
What am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to go out there and do it myself?
Huh?
Huh?
Answer me!
Maybe I'm getting sloppy.
Maybe I want to get caught.
Maybe I'm just tired of this.
Excuse me, everyone.
Let me through here, please.
As some of you may have heard, there was an incident last night and one of your recent graduates here was killed.
I want to assure you that we're doing everything possible to find those responsible for this tragedy.
But in the meantime we need you all to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity, because your safety is our number-one concern.
It's you again, huh?
You know, I really want to be left alone.
- Me too.
- So leave.
You leave.
I've lived here longer than you.
What is that?
What, this?
It's a Rubik's Cube.
You don't know Rubik's Cube?
Is it a puzzle?
Yeah.
Want to try it?
You can give it back tomorrow.
How do you do it?
You gotta get each side one color.
Like that.
You smell kind of funny.
Aren't you cold?
I don't really get cold.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's dance...
Let's dance
To the song they're playing...
Help me.
Hello?
Please.
Help me.
Hello?
Hey there.
Are you okay?
What happened?
I fell.
Yeah?
Well, can't you get up?
No.
How old are you, sweetheart?
Do you live around here?
I live right here.
Can you carry me?
Sure. Sure, sweetheart.
Just grab on, honey, okay?
- Got it?
- Thank you.
What did you do?
What did you do?!
You did it again!
I have to clean it up!
Bitch! Oh you fucking bitch!
Fuck this shit.
Fuck!
How did you do it?
I just... twisted it.
Do I smell better now?
What's your name?
Abby. What's yours?
I'm Owen.
How old are you?
12, more or less.
What about you?
12 years, eight months and nine days.
What do you mean, more or less?
When's your birthday?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Don't you celebrate your birthday?
Do you get birthday presents?
No.
Well, you can have this if you want.
That's okay.
It's yours.
I still don't get how you did this.
Want me to show you?
Yeah.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Yon light is not daylight.
I know it, I.
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
Oh, let me be taken, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye...
Shh.
Shh shh.
What were you writing back there?
What do you mean?
In Cook's class.
Let's see it.
No.
No?
Where is it?
Where is it?
- Ow.
- Show me.
- Jesus Christ, dude.
- What?
You explain that to his mom.
It's okay.
She's not going to tell her mom on us, is she?
She fell down on the playground, that's all.
Right?
Right?
Say it, little girl.
Say it!
Come on, man, let's go.
I fell down on the playground.
You have to be more careful, okay, honey?
I hate to see my baby get hurt.
Bless us O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive.
Please guide and direct us for all our days and protect us from evil.
Okay look, I made one for you and one for me.
Are you reading this?
Yeah, it's for school. It's boring.
Come on, look at this.
It's really cool.
We can talk to each other through the wall.
Can you hear me through the wall?
Only sometimes.
Did you hear anything the other night?
Why was your dad so mad?
Where's your mom?
Are your parents divorced?
My mom's dead.
My mom and dad are getting a divorce.
What happened there?
Just some kids from school.
Where do you go to school anyway?
I've never seen you-
Owen, listen.
What?
You have to hit back.
You have to hit back hard.
I can't.
- There's three of them.
- Then you hit back even harder.
Hit them harder than you dare and then they'll stop.
What if they hit me back?
You have a knife.
Yeah, and what if that doesn't stop 'em?
Then I'll help you.
But you're a girl.
I'm a lot stronger than you think I am.
I have to get in there.
Move.
Move.
Dance the blues...
- hi
- hi
Let's dance...
Mr. Zoric?
Yes, Owen?
I was just wondering about the after-school strength training.
Can people still sign up?
Would you like to get strong?
Okay.
4:00 you come- we make you strong.
Cool.
Do you really want to hurt me?
This is Ms. Pac-Man.
Now I'll play.
Do you really want to make me cry?
And...
...when you get the big thing, you can eat them.
- Right there.
- Yeah, let me do it.
In my heart the fire's burning...
God, I hate this game.
You want some?
They're really good.
They're my favorite.
They're really really good.
No thanks.
Well, what do you like?
You can have anything you want.
That's okay.
Oh, okay.
I guess this is it.
Hey.
I guess I could have one.
Really?
Here, it's grape.
I like it.
I'm sorry.
Owen, do you like me?
Yeah.
A lot.
Would you still like me even if I wasn't a girl?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
I guess.
Why?
No reason.
So where are you guys from?
How come you moved here?
We... we move around a lot.
Yeah, but why would you move here?
Nobody moves here.
I hate it here.
Someday I'm gonna get out and I'll never come back.
The people here... they're- they're just stupid.
Owen!
God.
Hang on.
What?
You promised me you wouldn't leave the courtyard.
Mom, I've been here the whole time.
Well, come up.
It's time for dinner.
God.
Good night.
Good night.
Are you going out?
Is there a choice?
Please don't see that boy again.
Okay?
Hey, Jett.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
Can I get a ride? Keith went over to see his girlfriend.
Yeah, sure. Get in.
Keith's so fucking whipped, dude.
I can't even deal with it anymore.
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to move the seat.
It's in the front.
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man.
Yeah man, anytime.
Keith would have left me stuck there all night.
- Do you need gas?
- Yeah.
Home isn't pretty
Ain't no home for me
Home in the darkness
Home on the highway
Home isn't my way
Home I'll never be
Burn out the day
Burn out the night
-  I can't see no reason...
- Fuck! Fuck!
To put up a fight...
Help!
Help!
Thanks.
- What's up, Jett?
- Hey guys, what's going on?
I'm not the one to tell you
What's wrong or what's right...
Help!
I've seen suns that were freezing and lies that were true
But I'm burnin', I'm burnin'
I'm burnin' for you...
I'm burnin', I'm burnin'
I'm burnin' for you...
What the fuck?
That's my car! Hey, my car!
Stop the car!
What the fuck?
Argh! Argh! Argh!
Greg was in there.
- What?
- He was in the car!
Hey!
Greg.
Greg!
Abby.

Now & Lat-
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States,
Ronald Reagan.
Thank you.
Excuse me,
I'm looking for my father.
Is he a patient here?
Yeah, they- they brought him in.
The police did.
Oh, I see.
Do you know where he is?
Well, he's on the 10th floor, sweetie, but it's restricted.
Look, why don't we give them a call and tell them-?
No no, that's okay.
Oh my God, the poor girl.
Sweetie, sweetie!
May I come in?
His daughter?
When was this?
Is she still here?
Well, did she leave any information, a phone number?
What do you mean a little girl?
How little?
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.
Somebody help!
Owen.
Owen.
Hmm?
Can I come in?
No no no, wait wait.
Don't look at me.
But you have to say it- that I can come in.
You can come in.
Close your eyes.
They're already closed.
How did you get up here?
I flew.
Yeah, right.
Hey, you're not wearing anything.
And you're freezing.
Is that gross?
No.
Abby...
Yeah?
Will you go steady with me?
What do you mean?
Will you be my girlfriend?
Owen,
I'm not a girl.
You're not a girl?
No.
What are you?
I'm nothing.
Oh.
You know, it's okay if you don't want to be my girlfriend.
You don't have to make stuff up.
Look, can we just keep things the way they are?
Yeah, sure.
Well, do you have to do anything special when you go steady?
No.
So everything's the same?
Yeah.
Okay.
We can go steady.
Really?
Yeah.
"I must be gone and live or stay and die."
Slow down.
Hockey you play in the center.
Free skating over that side.
Now, everyone, careful of holes in ice.
Stay away from the holes.
I hope you've been learning how to swim,
'cause today you're going in.
Go.
Bring it up and start passing.
Pass pass pass.
Over here.
What do you think you're gonna do with that?
I'm gonna hit you with it if you try anything.
Really?
Wow.
You know what I think?
I don't think you're gonna do a fucking thing.
I think you're just gonna stand there like the little girl you are.
And I'm gonna grab that stick and ram it right up your ass.
And then you're going swimming.
I want to hear click-click-click-click.
Shit, dude. Zoric's right over there checking us out.
Let it go.
We'll beat his little ass later.
Give me the stick.
Give me the stick.
Argh!
Jesus Christ, are you fucking crazy?
Hey!
Hey!
Boy
Okay okay, just move.
Please, just move back.
Move back.
Give me one reason why I shouldn't suspend you, Owen.
Can you think of one?
Don't you know what could have happened?
You seem like a smart kid.
I just don't want to see you going down the wrong path.
He's a good boy.
He really is.
Hello, is John there?
Excuse me, this is his wife.
Who is this?
Hello, Cindy.
Will you please tell John that I called?
Hey there.
Is your mom and dad home?
Yeah.
Mom!
What?
- Oh.
- Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
- What's this about?
- I'm afraid there's been an incident with one of your neighbors here in the complex.
So we're just going around, talking to everybody to see if they know anything.
What kind of incident?
Owen, why don't you go to your room?
- Sorry, guys.
- Jeez, could you take any longer?
- I said sorry.
- Come on, let's go play Centipede.
Man, why are you even in that class? It's so gay, dude.
Whatever.
Hey! Stop!
- How's the cripple?
- Stop! Hey!
Jesus Christ, dude, watch out.
Man, that kid whaled on your ass.
Can you still hear me, bro?
Stop.
Are you going home?
No, we're going over to Mark's.
Can I borrow your keys?
I forgot mine.
Please.
Give me the fucking keys.
Thanks.
- See you at home, little girl.
- Hey.
Shut up.
- We didn't say anything.
- Shut up.
Abby, I did it.
You did what?
They were gonna push me in the hole in the ice, so I got a really big stick and I hit
Kenny in the head really hard.
He had to go to the hospital.
I almost got suspended, but I didn't.
What you said-
I stood up to them.
Owen.
Yeah?
Hey, you want to go somewhere?
Where?
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
This kid that used to live in the building-
Tommy- he would come down here and drink and smoke with his high school friends.
And when they weren't here, he'd play ping-pong with me.
He was really cool.
But then he had to move away.
I kind of like it here.
It's cool.
And I don't think any of the adults know about it- it's just us.
So what did you want to do down here?
Uh...
I think I have an idea.
Close your eyes.
Keep them closed.
Let's make a pact.
It only hurts for a second.
Here.
Abby?
Go away.
Virginia.
God damn it, Virginia.
Virginia!
Get- off!
Hey.
Hey.
Somebody call 911!
Mom?
Mom.
Hello?
Dad, can I talk to you?
Yeah sure, pal.
What is it?
Do you- do you think there's such a thing as evil?
What?
What are you talking about, pal?
Can people be evil?
Listen, where are you getting all this stuff?
Is this from your mother-
- all her religious crap?
- No.
You know what, Owen?
Listen listen, put your mother on the phone, okay? I want to talk to her.
She- she's not here.
All right, she's not- okay well, please tell her to call.
Just tell her to call me when she gets back, all right?
Okay?
Dad.
Owen, I want you to get that crap out of your head, okay?
Your mother- she- listen, look, she has problems.
And I'm gonna talk to her.
So I don't want to hear any more of this.
All right?
All right?
Yeah.
You have a good night, pal.
I love you.
I'm sorry about the last couple of months, you know?
But I'll see you soon- real soon, okay?
I promise.
Maybe next weekend.
Mm-hmm.
I love you.
Can I come in?
You have to say it.
You can come in.
Are you a vampire?
I need blood to live.
But how old are you- really?
But...
I've been 12 for a very long time.
Where's your dad?
He wasn't my dad.
What's all this stuff?
I like puzzles.
I want to go now.
I want to go.
Are you gonna let me?
What are you gonna do to me?
I told you we couldn't be friends.
Hi. Are you Larry?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
I'm sorry to bother you.
How is she doing?
It's been quite a night.
They had to give her over six pints of blood.
We're just waiting to see if her body rejects it.
Well, I won't keep you long.
I just- I need ask you about the description you gave of the little girl.
You said that she had long blonde hair, she was 12 years old and she wasn't wearing any shoes.
- Right?
- That's right.
Have you ever seen this man?
He's a suspect in a murder investigation.
Looks like a guy from our building.
Did he have a daughter like the girl you described?
I don't know.
I've only seen him a few times.
Why? Do you think this has something to do with your murder case?
Maybe. We're starting to think that some of them might be involved
- in some sort of Satanic cult.
- What?
We found another body a few days ago- same MO, victim completely drained of blood.
There were two bite marks, small ones, on the victim's neck- just like a little child's.
Jesus Christ.
Oh!
- Virginia, Virginia.
- Stay back. Stay back.
Oh- mm.
We're told one patient was killed in the fire as well as one hospital nurse.
The five-alarm fire started on the eighth floor of the hospital and took most of the day for crews to contain.
The official cause is still under investigation.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You have to invite me in to your home.
What if I don't?
Why can't you just come in?
Is there something in your way?
No no no, stop stop.
You can come in.
You can come in.
What was that?
I don't know.
I just know this is what happens if you don't invite me in.
What if I didn't say anything?
Would you have kept bleeding?
Would you have died?
I knew you wouldn't let me.
We had broken up for good just an hour before
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing 'cross the floor
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh...
You can borrow one of my mom's old dresses if you want.
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
It was the same old song with the melancholy sound
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
They don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
We'd been living together for a million years
Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh...
Hello?
Owen.
I'm in here.
I'll be right there.
Los Alamos weather at 6:20 AM.
Calm and cold this morning with temperatures around 24°, then picking up this afternoon bringing snow flurries.
We're expecting 6-12" of snow in the next 24 hours...
"Hi Owen. Good morning.
I am in the bathroom.
Please do not come in.
Want to hang out with me again tonight?
I really like you.
Love, Abby."
Hello?
Police department.
Open the door.
Open the door!
Police officer!
No no, stop!
Jesus.
Owen, I have to go away.
Ah, speak of the devil.
There he is.
Hi.
Today we start in pool, okay?
Okay.
Hey Owen.
Oh, hi.
He's here.
Come on, hurry up.
Just like we did before, kick, then in water- one-two-three breathe, one-two-three breathe.
Kick kick. Good.
One-two-three breathe.
Yes.
One-two-three breathe.
Mr. Zoric, there's a fire.
- What?
- Out back.
Owen, I'll be right back.
- Where?
- At the dumpsters.
Everybody out of the pool.
Move. Come on, get out.
Out.
I said everybody get out.
- Get out of the pool.
- Owen!
Owen!
Owen!
What are you gonna do with that?
No no no no.
Stop!
No no. No! Help!
Stop! Guys, stop!
No. Stop. Stop.
Stop! Stop!
Oh! Somebody! Ow!
Stop!
Grab his arms.
Get his arms.
No no, stop it.
We're gonna have a little contest, okay?
You stay underwater for... three minutes.
If you can do it,
I'll just give you a little nick- on your cheek.
But if you can't,
I'm gonna poke out one of your eyes.
Got it?
An eye for an ear.
Three minutes.
You'd better take a deep breath.
- Okay, Jimmy.
- Shut up.
- Dude, come on.
- I said shut up!
What the f-?
What the fuck is this? Argh!
Oh my God, Jimmy! Jimmy!
Oh my God, oh my God.
No no no no!
No no.
Excuse me, can I see your ticket?
Is that trunk yours?
hi
hug and kiss
Eat some now, save some for later
Eat some now, save some for later.
On October 13, 2008, Filmkameratene AS received an anonymous package with two hard disks containing
283 minutes of filmed material.
This film is a rough-cut version of that material.
Everything is shown in chronological order and no images have been manipulated.
A team of investigators spent more than a year trying to establish whether this was a practical joke or if the material was authentic.
They concluded that it was authentic.
Ready?
Turn on the radio.
- Johanna, do you have sound?
- Yes.
This isn't working.
Bear tracks were found yesterday in Volda.
A hunting party arrived there today.
The leader of the hunting party had the following to say:
We expect to locate this bear fairly quickly.
Our real concern is that a poacher has been following us.
Only a select few ever get bear-hunting licenses.
I know every single bear hunter in Norway.
That guy in the Land Rover is no bear hunter.
If he's gunning for our bear, he's breaking the law.
- Have you ever seen him?
- We see him all over.
If I see him again, there'll be consequences.
He's nothing but a poacher.
- What would you like to tell him?
- To lay his cards on the table.
Drive!
- There's too much traffic.
- We're going to lose him!
Ready?
We know his name is Hans, but we have no last name.
Thomas, try being more serious.
But what is he doing in Volda?
Who is he?
- Do we have sound?
- You haven't plugged in the...
You won't get an interview with a poacher.
I don't like it when you ridicule him.
That's great!
Thank you. Bye.
Thomas, that poacher is staying at the campground!
I can't say I know him, but he is here.
He's staying right over here.
Want me to show you?
I don't know what that smell is, but his camper sure reeks!
- What are all those things?
- I have no idea.
Thyme?
He drives off and stays out all night.
He's never back before sunrise.
- He stays out all night?
- Yes. Every night.
- In good spirits?
- Sure.
We don't know when or if he'll show up.
- There he is!
- I'm filming. Just ask him directly.
Hi. My name's Thomas.
We're from Volda College.
Could we ask you a few questions?
Get lost.
Maybe we could come back...
- Did it work?
- Quiet, I hear something.
Yes, I'm on my way out now.
I expect to find it tonight.
Okay, fine. Bye.
- He isn't here.
- He was right in front of us!
Sure, but...
- Shit!
- Nice work, Thomas.
- Can you see anything?
- Yeah.
Some furry things are hanging down from the ceiling.
And there's a shotgun.
We're on our way to where a bear was just found shot.
Could he have been the shooter?
Lord knows where this one came from.
I've checked with every registered bear hunter I know.
None of them shot this one.
The bear population is managed by the state.
So a downed bear like this one causes quite a fuss.
Look at this.
These tracks don't match the way a bear normally walks.
I think someone brought this bear and dumped it here.
- That's weird.
- I agree. Very weird.
You're from the Wildlife Board.
Finn Haugan, right?
These hunters say those aren't bear tracks.
That's ridiculous.
What else would they be?
There is a bear right there, with tracks all around it.
- But why are they in doubt?
- Ask them! It's crazy.
We have waited for Hans for hours, but now he's finally moving.
We think he's heading somewhere, and we are going to follow him.
Go!
It looks like he's heading for the ferry.
How long are we going to keep following him?
Can you see what he's carrying?
It's a car tire.
- What's he doing?
- I can't tell.
Three, two, one, and...
Sogn og Fjordane county!
Okay, he's over there.
Just hide here.
We met a little while back.
- Really?
- Thomas, from Volda College.
- Is that...
- Are you following me?
We just want to ask you a couple of questions.
No.
Are you...
What were you doing in Volda?
Did you shoot that bear?
Stay the hell away from me.
Turn that off.
Leave me alone!
Once we get what we need, we can go back.
It would be so awesome to get him to talk.
We have tried, plenty of times.
Do you think Michael Moore gave up after the first try?
Left arm or right foot?
The one you kick with?
We have been here all afternoon.
I think he's sleeping in his trailer.
So now we wait until something happens.
Are you serious?
Okay.
I have to get my sound gear.
What is this?
"No trespassing. Blasting area."
Did you see that?
Was that a road?
Did you?
This road is horrible.
If we run into a bunch of inbred pig farmers, your ass is first...
- I'm not...
- Stop whining.
- I'm just being honest.
- Want to go back?
- Fine by me.
- That's not what I meant.
Hey, wait for me!
Look here.
I don't think he's in his car.
- So we know he's here...
- But what is he up to?
Here's a trail.
- I hear something in the distance.
- What?
Troll!!!
Thomas!
Hurry!
My car is right over here!
- What?
- Something bit me!
- Are you all right?
- It stings.
- You heard him yell "troll," right?
- Shut up.
You need some more.
- Can I help?
- There's gauze in the first-aid kit.
- Ow! Don't...
- We have to get this out.
You look like hell, Thomas.
- What the hell was that?
- Tetanus shot.
You yelled something back there in the woods.
- You heard him, Johanna.
- What's this slime?
What did he say?
- More?
- Yes.
Can you give us a ride to our car?
It isn't very smart to follow me.
Did you yell "troll" out there?
- Is that your car?
- What the hell?
- What happened?
- That's our car!
Someone crushed our car.
It's completely demolished.
Look at this, Thomas.
- Hans, do you understand this?
- I have an idea.
Okay, what...
A bear didn't do this.
What do you think happened?
- What...
- Ask him if a troll did it.
Hey, if you know what happened to my car, you should say so!
- You yelled "troll".
- Forget about that!
What the hell do you want?
You want me to say trolls exist, on film?
- You find that funny?
- No, but you don't actually believe...
If you want a ride, you'd better come right now.
- What should we do?
- I think I'll walk.
You have our bags?
Just so we get this straight: you actually believe trolls exist?
Why are you so sure it was a bear that attacked you?
What's the matter?
Why are we stopping?
Thanks for giving us a ride.
We'd love to join you, and film what you do.
We'd be very interested.
I'll let you film me killing whatever scratched you, on one condition:
You do exactly as I say, no matter what I say. Okay?
Yes.
I feel like I'm bleeding everywhere.
- Are you admiring your wound?
- Yuck! Don't film that!
- You're crazy.
- I'm serious.
- Why call them?
- To tell them where we are.
He isn't dangerous, just weird.
Remember, he runs the show.
We do exactly as he says.
Then we'll get our footage.
No one here believes in God or Jesus?
Nope. None of us.
Don't look at me.
Serious? Because they can smell
"the blood of a Christian man"?
Is that alright?
Close the gate and hang up that sign.
NO TRESPASSING.
BLASTING AREA.
- Is this a land mine?
- Yes. But it isn't armed.
I'm sitting on a land mine?
Are you nuts?
Anyone who doesn't want to join me?
Who's changed their mind?
Who's afraid of trolls?
- No.
- No? Good.
Go down to that creek, take off all your clothes, and scrub yourselves.
- Especially your armpits and groin.
- No way!
- Why?
- To remove any body odor.
Then rub this all over yourselves and your clothes.
- What is that?
- Troll stench.
- Rub it all over your bodies.
- It reeks! No way. Forget about it.
You have to smell like a troll, or they'll smell us and run away.
Christ!
- No. No way!
- I'm not doing this, Thomas.
Forget about it!
You agreed to do exactly as I said.
If you don't do it,
I'll go up there alone and leave you here.
Is that understood?
Are you ready?
You're all greased up?
You look cute.
Here, flashlights for you.
- What is that?
- A big flash bulb, basically.
Hans? That weapon.
How do you use it?
It blasts a powerful ultraviolet beam.
UVB rays. The same as the sun, or a tanning lamp.
Don't you know sunlight turns them to stone, Thomas?
- Right. Or they explode.
- Haven't you read anything?
I read fairy tales when I was a kid, but... Did you know that, Kalle?
So, what do you do if a troll wants to have an eating contest with you?
Eating contest?
Fairy tales usually don't match reality.
They seem to in this case.
- Troll piss.
- Christ!
You can smell it all the way over here.
Listen, I'm hunting a Ringlefinch.
There's piss everywhere.
He's marking. Looks like he's been chased from his territory.
He seems sick. I'd like to find out what's wrong with him.
A blood sample from the troll?
I don't have the right equipment.
You too. Bye.
I need help to find out what's wrong.
But a blood sample...
That won't be easy.
Who were you talking to?
A veterinarian.
A vet!
If you wait here,
I'll try to chase the troll out.
Is this what you imagined?
I bet it's going to take him some time to find a troll out there.
I feel sorry for him if he really believes in trolls.
Maybe he's filming us.
- That's probably what he's doing.
- He's somewhere laughing at us.
While we sit here like idiots.
Lingonberry?
- In the woods?
- Yes, with no food or water.
- Cool!
- What?
It's a night-vision camera.
Listen!
That's just him.
One week, or being bitten by a bear.
- It makes for a good story.
- You would look ridiculous!
- So I think I'll choose that.
- Being bitten by a bear?
Do you feel that?
I'm picking up some strange sounds.
What is that?
Seriously.
What's going on?
What is this?
This is one real bad joke.
It's a Tosserlad!
Get the hell out of here!
Run, dammit!
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Where did it go?
Do you see it?
Get behind my car!
No!
- Give me the camera!
- No!
Where is Johanna?
Thomas! Kalle!
- Johanna!
- It's real!
I told you so!
I knew it!
They are real!
- Say something.
- It's been turned to stone!
We ran through the woods...
Why the hell did you say that none of you were Christian?
The way that troll sniffed around...
Obviously one of you believes in God.
I don't believe in God.
I sang in a church teen choir...
But that's because my parents forced me to.
I don't believe in God.
I'm serious.
- I can tell it's not her.
- What? How?
Knock it off. That was some genetically-engineered monster.
- That's a troll.
- Nonsense!
Question!
Why doesn't anybody know about this?
Because someone doesn't want people to know.
The government?
Is the government behind this?
Do you work for them?
- Why show it to us now?
- Because I'm tired of this shitty job.
I have no rights whatsoever.
I get no night bonus.
No overtime.
No nuisance compensation.
Maybe it's time for a change in troll management.
- So if you could get this on TV...
- That shouldn't be a problem.
Come on.
You want to see more of these, learn what's really going on?
You might want to step back.
Holy shit!
Anyone need some gravel?
Who the hell is that?
- Who is that?
- I don't know.
Hi there.
It's that guy we filmed...
What is this, Hans?
A film crew?
They wanted to see some trolls.
Aren't you that guy from the Wildlife Board?
This is an exceptionally bad idea.
Turn off that camera.
I have enough problems.
The valley is full of dead cattle.
I can't talk about this on film.
Turn off that camera.
- Put it down.
- We're allowed to film here.
- Sure you're on top of this?
- Totally.
As soon as the scapegoat arrives,
I will take care of the rest.
PIOTER'S POLISH PAINT SERVICE
The Ringlefinch is still out there.
Then find it!
Two German tourists disappeared last night.
- We expect to lose a few more.
- That isn't my problem.
If you think I'll let you keep those recordings, you're wrong!
It says "Pioter's Polish Paint Service".
What exactly is your job description?
My job is to kill any troll that breaks out of its territory
- and comes near people.
- How often do they break out?
Rarely. This is a special situation.
Too many trolls are out and about.
Finn is a... bureaucrat.
He works for TSS.
His primary job is to prevent...
To keep people from knowing that trolls exist.
In one sense, you are a true Norwegian hero.
No, you're wrong about that.
There's nothing heroic about what I do.
It's dirty work.
How can no one know about this?
Let's take these recordings, drive to Oslo, and sell them for a fortune.
We can't do that yet.
We have to keep following him.
Finn is pissed off.
- Now what?
- Breakfast.
- You should eat something too.
- I'm not hungry.
I feel a little... nauseous.
How many types of troll are there?
You have two main groups: mountain trolls and woodland trolls.
The subgroups include
Ringlefinch, Tosserlad, Rimetosser.
Mountain Kings.
The Harding, out west.
But that troll we saw...
Do they all have three heads?
No, there are many variations.
The heads develop as they age.
They aren't born with three.
They are usually born with one.
The others appear later.
They only have an eye in the middle, the original, head.
The other heads aren't really heads.
They're a sort of protuberance.
Their function is to scare other trolls.
Or impress the females.
What is that form?
- What does TSS stand for?
- Troll Security Service.
We have to fill out this form after each kill.
Location, gender, whether it blew up or turned to stone...
SLAYED TROLL FORM
In fairy tales, trolls wear clothes and talk like people.
- They're just like people.
- Fairy tales are for kids.
Trolls are animals.
Predators.
They eat, shit and mate.
Eat anything they can.
- How old can trolls get?
- 1000, 1200 years.
- And their intelligence level?
- In the pits. They are not bright.
They manage to eat.
But how hard is it to survive on rocks?
I once saw a troll try to eat its own tail.
His head between his legs, he tried to suck down his own tail.
He started gagging on it, tipped over and rolled down a hill like a wheel.
- I was a Navy Ranger.
- And that led you to troll hunting?
No, they were looking for someone who could...
- So you're the only one in Norway?
- Yes.
Are we leaving?
- They eat all sorts of crap.
- Do they eat people?
- You want to offer yourself?
- No. But have they eaten people?
- Are those troll tails?
- Yes. Some skinned, some whole.
- Why?
- So it smells like troll in here.
Why do you want a troll smell?
So I can approach the trolls without them noticing.
- Tanning lamps?
- Yes.
- You can get skin cancer.
- I use sunscreen.
I have trouble sleeping in the dark.
- Is that what we rubbed on ourselves?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- Concentrated troll stench.
A mixture of all the crap you can squeeze out of a troll.
Let's go find that Ringlefinch before he eats every animal in the county.
Two German tourists were found killed by a bear.
Finn Haugan from the Wildlife Board is investigating the tragedy.
Do you know where the troll might be?
No.
What are you looking for?
Rock slides, toppled trees, things like that.
See anything?
- Do I look like that famous painting?
- Yeah.
Maybe you should see a doctor?
- Do you really feel sick?
- It comes and goes.
- Are we safe here?
- They only come out at night.
Kalle, can't we...
It hasn't been triggered.
Some small trolls have taken the bait.
Concrete and charcoal is an unbeatable combination.
- Do it now!
- Now?
Hans thinks he has found the trail of a Ringlefinch...
Hans thinks he has found tracks.
Some farmers have found sheep carcasses nearby.
Hans thinks there's a link between the two.
Hurry up!
Global warming has led to changes...
in our flora and fauna.
These tracks you see around here... are from a Russian bear that came through Finland and Sweden.
The bear stores its food here under the bridge.
- Isn't that strange behavior?
- Not for Russian bears.
Due to the long, hard winters, they store their food. Just like squirrels.
Aren't these tracks a little strange?
That's the left foot.
And the right foot is over here.
Has the bear walked cross-legged?
I assume you have seen bear tracks before.
Hey, what about those tracks?
He's gnawed at the bark.
Typical Ringlefinch behavior.
He'll be back tonight.
I have something to lure him with.
- And then you'll kill him?
- Yes.
But first, I need to get that blood sample.
Is this the syringe?
This is horrible!
It's cruelty to animals.
Cruelty?
He's just using them as bait.
You're too far away.
Move closer.
No, I'll just zoom.
We can see fine from here.
What working hours...
We've been here forever.
Maybe no troll will show up?
- We can see fine from here.
- But we can see better from there!
Come on.
It's here.
Hear that?
Run!
God, I hate this crap!
Keep your distance.
I'm about to toss out some Christian man's blood.
Move back!
Shit!
Kalle! Thomas!
Move! Move over!
Are you alright?
Hey...
Are you alright?
Help him up.
- Come on, Hans.
- Are you alright?
Careful with that red button.
Give me the syringe.
Stay up there.
Now we know that trolls also explode.
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thanks.
Could've been worse.
Just a little sore.
A little sore?
This is crazy!
At least I got the blood sample.
I'll be there in a half hour.
Thanks. Bye.
You look like a newborn!
It's just a film team.
They have some questions.
ARDAL PET CLINIC
- Is that the blood?
- Yes.
- It was quite a struggle.
- I can tell.
You're a mess!
- Thanks.
- There's a bathroom in there.
- What do you see?
- There aren't enough red blood cells.
This will take me a couple of days.
Could we have a short interview?
If you could just stand... or maybe sit over there.
- What should I tell them?
- Everything.
- We aren't allowed.
- I take full responsibility.
The trolls' main problem is that they can't convert vitamin D from the sunlight, into calcium.
So when they are exposed to bright sunlight, their bodies overreact.
Their stomachs expand.
Gases are forced into their intestines and veins.
This becomes unbearable.
- And they explode?
- They explode.
- But some trolls turn to stone.
- Yes, the older ones.
Their veins are too constricted, so the expansion occurs in their bones.
In a matter of seconds, everything calcifies and they turn to stone.
I wish they didn't have to experience such pain.
It is traumatic for them, even though it only takes a few seconds.
We would have preferred to give them an injection.
- I'll have the results in a few days.
- And you'll call me?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Ready to go?
- Sure.
- Why all these local newspapers?
- To collect information.
- About what?
- Trolls.
Accidents and things that have happened, that trolls are behind.
- I have files back there.
- Can I take a look?
- "Road disappeared."
- People want natural explanations.
But if you know what to look for, you'll see what's caused by trolls.
This bridge was smashed by a wading troll that bumped his head.
Are there trolls that big?
Yes, the Jotnar.
I'm the only person to have seen one.
There's a mountain troll territory on the Finnmark plateau.
And one on the Hardanger plateau.
Three in Jotunheimen, one in Dovre.
We have to find out where the problem lies.
Jotunheimen is closest.
We are on our way to the first territory
Hans wants to check.
At the moment, we are circling around the territory.
The territory ends up here, and because this tire is intact...
Hans says no trolls have left this territory.
If they had left, they would have gnawed on this tire.
Smile!
Film over there.
Trolls love to gnaw on old car tires.
One has tried to kick his way into the good stuff here, but failed.
- How many trolls are there?
- Impossible to say.
You must have some idea?
The gestation period is 10 to 15 years.
And they only have one kid.
- Are they mammals?
- Yes.
Let's see...
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
This looks fine. All the stones are in the same position.
This is apparently a battle area.
Mountain trolls and woodland trolls often come to blows here.
They throw stones at each other.
But there has been little activity here lately.
The guy behind us is paying.
Isn't that what they say?
Remember that big Jotnar?
They live here in Jotunheimen.
- Where?
- Inside the mountains.
- What are we doing?
- Just wait here.
I ate an entire loaf of bread.
Finn refuses to give in.
He claims all the runaways are from Dovre.
Because he doesn't see any in this satellite photo.
But you can't see trolls in satellite photos!
Let's get to the bottom of this.
We are on our way to a farm that was on the local news recently.
Hans thinks it's troll related.
Wow, look at that!
Did you get that?
- What happened here?
- A tornado.
- Did you see it happen?
- No.
Look at the position of those trees.
They should all point in the same direction.
Who showed you that map?
They didn't say who they were.
But they had fancy weather charts and satellite images.
And we saw what looked like a tornado.
At least three trolls ran though here and continued northward.
How can it be that no one sees huge beasts rampage across a field like this?
We'll come back tonight.
Head into the woods.
I'm tired.
- I don't like this.
- Let's stick together.
Seriously, Kalle.
We have to follow him.
What do you think we should do?
There are tracks further in.
Here's their trail.
They've passed through here.
- We can't stay here alone.
- This way!
An abandoned mine.
- They've been here.
- I'm not going in there!
There aren't any trolls there now.
Come on.
- Are you sure?
- Sure.
No, there's nobody home.
I need the troll stench.
- Here.
- I can take the camera.
Everything okay?
A whole pack of trolls lives here.
This is a lair.
- We can leave.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
Let's go.
Come on!
I'm coming!
Closer to the wall!
Head back inside!
Quick, in here!
Turn off your flashlights!
I have to get out of here.
- Do you have any more troll stench?
- No, not here.
Just relax. Breathe easy.
Calm down.
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm Christian!
- We're going to die!
- Damn!
You'd better not start sweating!
Dear Lord...
Shut up!
Run!
Sunlight!
It still works.
There are more in there.
I'll have to get them later.
Mountain Kings.
Why didn't he just say he was Christian?
I have to go to Dovre to find out why they keep running away.
I can give you a ride down, if you want to quit.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for those tapes.
In my trailer?
- Are you filming?
- No.
- It's out of control.
- Why aren't you up there?
I refuse to go into their territory.
There's no way.
- Turn off that camera.
- It's off.
But don't people have a right to know?
- What is your job?
- That's confidential information.
Why don't we have a right to know?
People are dying!
Why is this so secret?
- People have a right to know.
- No.
- Hands off the camera.
- This is none of your business.
Yes, this happens to be my business!
- Get lost!
- This isn't over.
I'm going to check it out.
Do you want to join me?
- Yes.
- Are you ready for that?
- Yes.
- Okay, let's keep on filming.
Let's find a new camera and continue.
Here comes our new camerawoman.
Malica.
- Malica.
- Thomas.
You are not Christian.
- You don't believe in Jesus or God?
- I'm a Muslim.
Excellent.
Muslim is okay, right?
I honestly don't know.
We'll see what happens.
- It must be okay.
- We're filming musk oxen, right?
No, not exactly.
- Let's go.
- Yes, we might as well.
We'll explain on the way.
- Where have you worked?
- Norwegian TV, BBC...
- I just filmed some lions in Tanzania.
- Lions. Good.
I've never seen anything like this.
Holy shit.
They've broken every single tree over several acres.
I assume what has happened is that a Jotnar has run through here.
A giant, over 200 feet tall, has chased the Dovre trolls down here.
We don't want Jotnars running around.
Give me a break.
Do you all actually believe in trolls?
You think a squirrel rampaged through here?
If only the trolls were happy.
But TSS wants to keep a lid on everything.
Those may look like normal power lines, but they're electric fences to keep the trolls at bay.
I don't know how they broke through.
I'll have to check.
Let's go visit the clowns in charge of the power grid.
- Do they know about the trolls?
- No way.
Have you had any problems up in Dovre?
Yes, you could say that.
You can hang your coats here.
Over here.
Several hundred meters of power line, knocked to the ground. 300,000 volts.
- When did this happen?
- Three weeks ago.
- Do you know how it happened?
- No. No one does.
Those cables are supposed to withstand hurricanes. We have no clue.
- Is this a school project?
- Yes. Volda College.
- Are you a teacher?
- No.
Where does that line go?
It runs from here... then north, in a loop, and back to here.
- So it runs in a circle?
- Yes, exactly.
You don't find that strange?
Maybe a little.
- Yes, it is strange.
- The power leads to nowhere.
Well, it does lead in a circle.
And in a beautiful landscape.
If a Jotnar runs through a power line, something is seriously wrong.
I'd better get up there and try to find it.
The territory starts there.
It's hell to put up new pylons.
Activists and farmers always complain.
I think they're pretty.
Those were placed out here as food for trolls.
This is the territory.
We have been here.
And here.
And no sign of trolls.
I think we should try this area next.
There's a TSS cabin up there where we can wait.
Some scientists say it is caused by natural phenomena, while others...
... more than 1000 quakes registered...
We are in a troll territory now.
You don't seem to like entering these territories.
Is there some particular reason?
There was a mountain troll territory up in Strynefjell.
Back in the '70s they decided to build tunnels through that troll-rich area.
Both the TSS and I tried to object, but to no avail.
I was given the task of going in and exterminating all the trolls.
Every last one.
Pregnant females. Kids.
Newborns that hadn't even learned to walk.
It was a massacre.
Hans' entire life has revolved around trolls.
Every day has been a struggle with and for trolls.
In many ways, he is a superhero here in Norway.
What would we have done without him?
That makes it all the more important for us to make this movie.
My shoulder.
Are you alright?
The sun will be up in an hour.
Should we go too?
He sounds a bit big, but I'll give it a shot.
It sounds like he's snapped completely.
This could be problematic.
Your phone is ringing, Hans.
- Where is it?
- On my seat.
Thomas speaking.
He's a little busy right now.
Can I...
Rabies?
- That Ringlefinch had rabies.
- Let me talk to Hilde.
Hi Hilde.
Are you sure?
That makes sense.
Okay.
You take care too.
Bye.
I'll bet all the trolls we've met had rabies.
This guy has spread it to the Ringlefinches and Mountain Kings.
- And even to you, Thomas.
- Me?
I don't have rabies.
Hello!
Dogs have rabies.
If you have rabies, you have to get to a hospital.
If you think he has rabies, he needs medical attention!
I don't have rabies.
You can't just say I have rabies!
If so, we need a hospital now!
- That beast is on its way. Get inside!
- I couldn't care less!
- We can't stay in here.
- Look!
Is it coming this way?
Go outside?
Are you crazy?
He's leaving!
Don't move!
I'll try to lure him this way.
What a friend we have in Jesus...
What is he doing?
What's happening?
The flash ran out of power.
Definitely rabies.
Can we go to the hospital now?
- No, he needs a few more doses.
- What are you talking about?
But first I have to wear him out.
He's closing in on us!
- Now we're getting away!
- Good.
- There's somebody up ahead!
- Stop, Hans!
- Get in!
- Hurry, dammit!
Go! Go!
- Where are you going?
- Stay here!
- Hans!
- Get back inside!
Oh my God!
Get back in the car!
- Who are you?
- A seismologist.
I have to get in front of him.
Look out!
Is it on?
Hans, what are you doing?
I have to give him the finishing blow!
- With that?
- Yes.
I hope you have all the footage you need.
This road will lead you to the highway.
There's no more roaring!
Malica...
Stop fooling around.
That's troll on tape.
Here is the footage.
Am I bleeding?
What did you say?
- Are you okay?
- Sure, I'm fine.
Look!
Over there!
Isn't that Finn and the others?
Shit, it's Finn.
Give me the camera!
Thomas, what are you doing?
The recordings end here.
No body was ever found in the mine and the teenagers behind the recordings have vanished without a trace.
We strongly encourage anyone with information about their fate to contact Filmkameratene AS or your nearest police station.
It has been impossible to get the Government to confirm the existence of the Troll Security Service.
However, an indirect confirmation was given during Norwegian Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg's biannual press conference in Oslo on June 25, 2010.
The press didn't get the point.
We want to protect the Norwegian environment as best we can.
Few people find power grids attractive.
I certainly don't.
Norwegians are pro electricity, but against power lines.
That won't work in the long run.
Norway has trolls, so more power lines are needed.
- That's just the way it is.
- That's a wrap!
TROLLHUNTER
Miss Emerson?
Are you prepared?
I brought this.
Just get it ready. Get it ready.
Life given. Life returned.
Life given. Death lifted.
Take this life force, consume its flesh.
Open our eyes to what is lost.
Memento mori. Memento mori.
Memento mori. Memento mori.
Memento mori. Memento mori.
Memento mori.
Memento mori. Memento mori.
Who? Whose loss?
This woman?
This grieving woman?
- Darling?
- Oh, God!
Don't look away. You mustn't look away.
Rose? Rose, darling.
I can see you.
I can see you.
Life given. Death lifted.
Life given. Death...
Get off me!
Sergeant Evans, the curtains.
The door! The door!
- Stay there, Captain.
- Get off me!
If you're a captain at all.
Sergeant Evans, fetch the others.
You bastard. You'll kill him!
I’ll fetch a doctor.
I’ll manage.
- Ah! Ow!
- Another miracle.
Miss Cathcart, you shouldn't do that.
Cathcart. Florence Cathcart.
How dare you come here under false pretences?
Ls your soldier boy even dead?
And this grotesque charade won't bring him back.
Neither will your blood capsules which you slipped from your cup and your handkerchief as we started.
Nor your free hand pulling the wick from this woman's candle.
As if the dead had something against naked flames.
You're charlatans.
And poor ones at that.
Get them out of here, Evans.
Get off! You bastard.
- I’ve got your brooch.
- Oh, thank you, Evans.
Miss Cathcart, when you do these things you've taken to ordering me around a little.
I just think with you being...
What, you don't want your colleagues seeing you bossed by a civilian woman?
Uh, I mean, if anyone was going to order me around, it'd be...
I mean, if Mrs Evans wasn't Mrs Evans...
But she is.
And she's very lucky, she is.
I won't bully you any more. Promise.
You've never had a child, have you?
No, of course you haven't.
- Allow me, miss.
- Thank you, Katie.
It's all right.
Oh, for heaven's sake. Um...
- Who shall I make it out to?
- I'm sorry?
- Please, Mr...
- Mallory.
Mr Mallory, you'll excuse my brevity, but this is my home.
- Very glad you enjoyed the book.
- I didn't.
- Excuse me?
- I didn't much like your book.
I found it too certain.
Perhaps that's only fitting for someone so rude to strangers.
I’m a history master at a boy's prep school.
Forgive my daughter, Mr Mallory.
She's not taking on any more work.
She's quite exhausted.
Um, let him speak, Harry. Please.
Um, I’m afraid Harry's right.
I’m really not taking on any more work.
But you are a ghost hunter as well as an author?
Well, you can't hunt what doesn't exist.
Ah, well, that's just it.
We think we have one that does.
I need to change.
Katie, will you show
Mr Mallory to my study.
- Yes, miss.
- I’ll be fine.
You're fine?
Mmm.
We always know why you throw yourself into this.
And we don't blame you for thinking that it will help.
But every time now, all we can see is the pain it causes you.
Yes.
I know. I'm sorry I keep doing this to you.
It's not fair.
"May your skin be flayed from your body"
"in the hell you so arrogantly claim does not exist.'"
An elderly woman in Dorset,
I seem to remember.
Our school matron is a devotee of your book and has told the headmaster about the work you do.
She assures him you're quite respected and your book sits alongside the Bible on many bookshelves.
Miss Cathcart, rumour is a dangerous thing.
Conversations in this room are confidential, Mr Mallory.
Especially if I don't take the case.
Our school is called Rookford in Cumbria.
Some years ago, a child was said to have been murdered there.
Not a pupil.
It was a private house then.
Well, who? Did they catch the killer?
There's no record. It was an important family. All hushed up.
Still, it's perfectly possible someone died there.
So you're here about a death that may or may not have happened however many years ago?
No.
I’m here about another death.
A pupil. Three weeks ago.
His name was Walter. Walter Portman.
The day before he died,
Walter went to see the headmaster, quaking with fear, convinced he'd seen a ghost.
The ghost of the murdered child.
Well, how did he know what the murdered child looked like?
This was taken 18 years ago.
Mr Mallory, this is...
This is an old school prank.
As the camera sweeps across to expose the plate...
One of the boys runs behind the row to appear at both sides.
He was still moving when it reached him.
I know. That was 1902.
This was '03.
And, lastly, '06.
All the boys in the school are accounted for.
All of them. In all the photographs.
Including this one, taken just one month ago.
Miss Cathcart, I can understand a child running the length of the line in the 15 seconds it takes for the camera to make its sweep.
What I can't explain is how he could get there.
The Millford woman.
Either a batch of partially exposed photographic plates or the same ghost was in my mother's potting shed.
It's half-term in two days.
We'll be lucky to get any of the children back unless...
I’m not interested in the commercial fortunes of your school.
There have been other sightings.
The boys believe...
Boys believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.
I’m sure some of them even believe in God.
You don't need me to tell you what happened to that generation of boys, Mr Mallory, and yet you don't see their ghosts stalking the halls of your school.
Rookford is a boarding school,
Miss Cathcart.
Most of the boys are as good as orphans.
I don't say that just because of your circumstances.
Well, then, why say it?
"Fear is all I remember of my childhood."
"I have glimpses of my parents' death"
"but nothing of our life in Kenya, nor coming to London."
"Nothing but a feeling of perpetual black terror.'"
Your tactics are despicable.
"Fear swallows children and the adults we become.'"
These boys aren't worried about bumps in the night.
They are frightened to death.
Please leave.
I was sent to request your help and I've done that.
You strike me as a woman who won't do anything she doesn't want to.
I’m at the Wellington Hotel.
Thank you for your time.
Semper veritas.
Latin gives a new school an air of respectability.
Means they can add a pound to the fees.
And I should imagine a boney fide ghost knocks it right off again.
Latin puns. What fun.
"Always the truth."
Let's see, shall we?
You can't wait.
You're that keen that people believe in nothing?
No, without science people don't believe in nothing.
They believe in anything, including spirits.
So we need them. But you don't.
I believe in evidence.
Need has nothing to do with it.
And yet you carry someone else's cigarette case.
Touché.
I’m sorry.
Mr Mallory, am I...
Go on.
Judd.
Hey! Knees, boys!
Miss Cathcart, this is Miss Hill the school matron. Maud to you and! me.
- How do you do?
- Maud?
She's taken this very hard.
She's an odd fish at the best of times.
For a start, she liked your book.
I feel like I know you.
I’ve read your book a dozen times at least.
It's on my bookshelf next to the Bible.
I’ve never met an educated lady before.
Not Cambridge and everything.
Never mind someone famous.
Oh, the Kaiser was famous, Miss Hill.
I... I just wrote a book.
Maud.
Mr Mallory told you to call me Maud.
Maud.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Did Mr McNair not say all boys inside, Thomas?
Tom.
Everyone's nerves are shot to pieces.
I’ve been here 14 years.
I know this place.
And I don't hold with any ghostly nonsense.
I just wanted you to know
I’m at your service.
Hello.
Stop it. Go on.
Howell, stick up for yourself.
And get that hair cut.
All of you, downstairs.
Thank you, Maud. I’ll take
Miss Cathcart to the headmaster.
Came with the building.
It's the boys' favourite.
John the Baptist, I think. This way.
It's actually Judith slaying Holofernes.
Story of a woman who stole into the enemy camp and seduced then beheaded their highest general.
Hmm. Those were the days, eh, Maud?
I’m not in, I’m out.
At least I was out. Now I'm in.
You must be the ghost lady.
Come through.
Reverend Purslow, this is Miss Florence Cathcart.
An educated woman.
Well, well, well. Glad you're here.
Presume you know you've a matron to thank.
So I believe. Glad I can be of service.
Child dying before a parent.
Dreadful thing.
I lost three of them.
I imagine you don't believe in the afterlife, Miss Cathcart.
No, I don't.
Terrible, isn't it?
Mr Mallory will give you a tour of the school.
I’m on my way to the dining room should you wish to see it.
Mr Mallory.
So I’m the guide now?
He's coming. He's coming.
After supper there's an hour of scrubs, that's compulsory reading to you.
OO.
I’ll show you where Walter was found.
I’d like to see everywhere the boys claim to have seen the ghost.
And perhaps you'd ask Maud to join us?
Most of the sightings were in here, including Walter's.
Ln fact, he was found outside here on the terrace.
Many of the boys are now too frightened to come in here.
Mr Mallory.
She doesn't like any superfluous sound.
"Ego contemno Latin." I hate Latin.
That you, Mallory?
Walter was found there.
Mr Broad found him just before breakfast.
- And these doors were locked?
- Mmm-hmm.
Did he have a bear or a toy animal?
- It's in the front office, yes.
- Could you?
You don't like him.
I have my reasons.
It would be indiscreet.
Where are his glasses?
He used to keep up the pretence.
Used to have a limp, too.
Kept him out of the trenches.
- His mother couldn't bear to keep it.
- Thank you.
And this was still on his bed the morning he was found?
Yes.
You said there were other sightings elsewhere in the house?
Yes. Mostly in the west dormitory.
Maud, perhaps I could leave this to you?
- Why aren't you at scrubs?
- My book, sir.
Are you all right?
And it's half-term tomorrow?
Boys with parents in far-flung places stay behind.
Apart from that, we have the place to ourselves.
Was he bullied?
They called him "Wheezy Walter".
He was asthmatic.
Who were his friends?
Did he have any friends?
Miss Cathcart, this is a good school.
But if you're different, the wrong kind of different...
His isn't the only mattress like this.
"Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere."
"The sequel of today unsolders all"
"The goodliest fellowship of famous knights."
"'Whereof this world hold record."
"Such a sleep they sleep, the men I loved."
"I think that we shall...
"We shall never more, at..."
"I think that we shall never more, at any future time,
"Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds."
Dowden!
Now.
Matron, I presume you've brought this young lady to my classroom for a purpose besides subjecting her to the outrageous behaviour of Mr Dowden?
Mr McNair. Boys,
I know you're all upset and frightened at the moment.
Well, Miss Cathcart is here to put your fears to bed.
She's one of the cleverest people in England. Miss Cathcart.
Stand.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Sit. Please sit.
How many of you did
Walter Portman talk to about this ghost?
Well, did any of you see this ghost boy for yourselves?
I did, miss. I saw it.
Stand, boy.
Would you like to come with me and describe...
It was horrible.
It was on the upper corridor.
- Wouldn't you rather...
- His face was twisted.
Blurred and sort of twisted.
Like in the photographs.
But he was in pain. Crying out.
It was him. Please kill it, miss.
Yes, please. Kill it, miss.
Silence.

Ghosts have footprints?
No, people pretending to be ghosts do.
They must hate you.
Who? The spiritualists?
No, the ghosts.
Be quiet.
You'll be quiet or so help me!
Victor, you did the run today.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
What's this mess?
Will she do what they say? The lady?
And what do they say?
That she'll kill the ghost.
And that one boy a night will die until she does.
She's not here to catch ghosts.
She's here to catch naughty boys up to mischief.
Silence now. Eyes closed.
It'll be dark soon.
Pary.
Parry.
Nobody...
Likes...
You!
Be quiet.
You'll be quiet or so help me!
Shh! Keep still.
Hello?
I heard bells. Are you all right?
First bell!
First bell!
Next three boys, please.
Quieten down.
Next.
Boys who have been seen can go to their classrooms at once.
They couldn't have been made with socks?
The prints I followed were definitely barefoot.
- Get back!
- Come on. Come on.
Why are we here, sir?
All right, turn around, stick your feet up.
Headmaster.
Parry.
- Sir.
- Parry.
What would your father have thought?
The night Walter died, he got up to use the latrine.
He wasn't wearing his spectacles.
Mr Parry here frightened him, using this to blur his face.
I didn't. I didn't do it to Walter.
And last night he tried to do the same thing to me. Didn't you?
Victor.
They said if I did it then they'd be nice.
- Stop snivelling.
- Malcolm, please.
Who?
- Them.
- Scab!
- Quiet!
- But I didn't do it before.
Not to Walter.
I liked Walter. We shared grots.
- Victor.
- I didn't scare him.
- No one knows who did.
- A boy is dead.
- Wasn't me!
- All right, it wasn't just him.
There was another boy last night.
I saw him down in the stairwell.
What?
Dowden?
- There wasn't another boy.
- Ah-ah-ah. You're behind this.
- Honestly, sir.
- You will name this other boy now.
There wasn't another boy. Please!
You will name this boy or you'll be thrashed where you stand. Mr McNair.
Honestly. No, there wasn't another boy, sir.
Please, I tell you, sir.
There wasn't another boy!
Please, sir, I promise, it was only me!
Wait, stop!
Honestly,
I’m telling you the truth.
For God's sakes. You've done quite enough damage, you will not do this.
What did you say?
You use a balsam for your chest.
I just smelled it on you.
I also found it smeared on the glass of the French doors and on the handles and on Walter's bear.
You were... You were there the night he died.
I protest. This is...
And did he protest when you found him downstairs, ripped the bear from him and left him out in the dark?
I came here to protect children from fear and you...
You are hell-bent on making them live in it.
- You can't die of fear.
- No.
But you can die of an asthma attack brought on by it.
- He was alive when I left him.
- Malcolm.
He was crying, insisting he'd seen a ghost.
I thought...
I thought I'd toughen him up.
It's not enough to be mollycoddled, Robert.
These boys must be strong.
Stronger than us.
Malcolm, there's not a man on earth I’d rather protect.
But the parents arrive shortly, and I must ask you to leave this school at once.
♫ Be still, my soul ♫
♫ Though dearest friends depart ♫
There was a chap in a trench not far from ours.
He used to sing this hymn most sunsets.
It's odd separating the past from the present.
The boys are transformed.
You should be pleased.
Semper veritas.
- Mmm.
- Truth comes at a price.
Ruined a damaged man.
Oh, I’m not thinking about Malcolm.
Nor are you.
I saw you.
As soon as you proved the ghost was a fraud, something happened to you.
- You were suddenly...
- Please, Robert.
I’ve done what was asked of me.
Proved there's nothing to fear.
Nothing.
You left church early.
Mr Judd.
You going home?
Found your ghost?
Another case to write up while McNair's thrown to the dogs.
After all he's been through.
You know, I wonder whether any of us really know what he went through, Mr Judd.
- You shouldn't talk to me like that.
- Excuse me?
- I’m sorry. I didn't mean to...
- You think I don't know?
Staying at home was wrong?
Come down here and tell me that?
Let me tell you something, ghost lady.
It's the living you wanna watch out for.
Not the dead.
There she is. Now try to forget all about it. The headmaster will.
Getting to go home. Cakes and puddings.
Lucky beggars.
Still, we'll have a nice time.
You always say that.
Lucky beggars. You always say that.
No!
There's nothing.
There's nothing.
Goodbye. See you in a week.
Check the out buildings before you go, Mr Baxter.
There are gypsies on the Tarrow farm.
Your ma and pa overseas, Tom?
They live in India.
Takes three weeks to travel to India.
They have tigers there.
Goodbye, Matron.
Mary.
Have you been?
No.
No, but I’ve seen the lions in Africa.
One of them even attacked me.
How come you're not dead?
Apparently I was rescued by one of the villagers.
Actually, a tribal chieftain.
Did he kill the lion?
I was very young. I think so.
The villagers took me in and looked after me until help came.
They called me their "Mowa-Zee".
White doll.
I wonder what they'd think of me today, seeing me in such a silly state.
- Tom, can you leave us now?
- Were your mother and father with you?
Were they killed?
Afraid they were.
Tom, Miss Cathcart and I want a grown-up conversation.
I like grown-up conversations.
Now.
Goodbye, Mowa-Zee.
Maud, it was an accident.
I lost my cigarette case.
How could someone like you want to do such a thing?
I don't want to talk about it.
Don't go. Miss, something has happened to you.
You can't leave this house now.
Please stop calling me miss.
It's Florence.
And I can't stay here.
I’m sorry.
Thank you.
I’ll be gone in an hour.
I fell.
I fell.
I know you're there, Robert.
Please don't go away.
Don't go.
You must be the ghost lady.
Come through.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Be quiet.
You'll be quiet or so help me!
Mr Mallory, I need your help.
You're not going?
Some of the equipment needs resetting.
- Can I...
- I don't understand.
You have your culprit.
You're doing more?
- Oh, would you...
- No, thank you.
Don't you like sherry?
I need to keep my wits about me.
I don't think
I shall ever drink alcohol.
- It makes you cross and sick.
- Mr Judd, you're welcome to join us.
Things to do, Matron.
Mallory.
Mr Mallory.
Florence, what are you doing?
I was brought here to explain a phenomenon in this house, and whatever everyone else may believe,
I have yet to do that.
A collective delusion has been experienced here, a child moving through the house as if there were no walls or floors.
You said that a child was murdered here.
What if that was also caused by...
You're doing this because of a feeling?
- This morning, you were...
- This is not a feeling!
This is a thesis. It's science.
- Tell me about the original murder.
- One can't even be sure there was one.
- Something is causing this.
- Two hours ago, you...
- Florence, why are you doing this?
- Florence.
- What is it?
- A differential thermometer.
It means this side of the corridor has suddenly become much colder than that side.
You said this was a private house.
Housemaids often had hidden cupboards for mops and brooms and so forth.
May even be stairs to the upper levels.
I know this.
It's an old nursery rhyme.
Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home.
Your house is on fire.
Your children are gone.
All except one.
We need to work. Lock the house.
- Florence, you don't need...
- Robert, lock the house.
This is nothing, it's a silly nursery rhyme.
I’m frightened.
Tom.
- Tom.
- He wants to get me.
Tom, nothing is going to happen to you. Nothing.
I promise you that.
Now I must work.
I'll be upstairs if you need me.
Can I sit with you? I won't talk.
Of course.
I get in trouble for talking.
But I don't talk much.
Did you have any friends at school?
You can talk to me.
I have make-believe friends. Sometimes.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Many children do. I know I did.
What was his name?
I’m not sure he had a name.
- Do yours have names?
- You're still lonely.
Aren't you?
I can tell.
With the boys at school, too,
I can tell.
You had a real friend once.
And you don't any more.
Did you love him or something?
Yes, I loved him.
He was a very kind man, a very good man.
But I was...
I did something very silly and very cruel.
I think I was frightened of losing him,
I loved him so much.
He was in the war.
What did you do?
I wrote to him and told him
I couldn't marry him and I didn't love him any more.
What did he say?
He died.
Not long after he got the letter.
But you did love him.
That's why you want him back.
Thank you. Mowa-Zee.
I don't think there's a place on earth people understand loneliness better than here.
You're torturing yourself.
Is that what you're doing here?
Proving again and again that he's really gone?
- Twisting the blade in deeper?
- You tell me.
Why? Is it guilt?
Preaching to me while you rip your leg to shreds as if that'll make you feel better for having survived!
You don't know what you're talking about.
Robert.
I’m frightened.
And I can't live with that.
And yes, you're right, what I do comes at a price.
I hate myself more and more, but I can't live with fear.
I’d sooner be dead myself.
Red four goes on the black five.
Every card has its place.
When they're back where they should be, you win the game.
And that goes there.
That one there.
Black eight can go on red nine.
It takes time.
That's why they call it "patience".
She's downstairs.
- Mowa-Zee.
- Tom. Tom!
Tom!
I know it's you, Tom.
I won't chase you.
Keep playing.
Florence.
Why are you doing this? You!
I heard you giggle.
- I heard him giggle.
- Florence!
You took me to a man.
Who was he? Who was he?
There was a... There was a man!
There was... There was a man!
Stop this!
It's... It's all of you!
You're all doing this!
You, you...
You cruel and horrid little boy.
Florence!
I hate you.
Thomas Hill, you will come back here at once and apologise.
Stop bossing me around.
I haven't done anything wrong.
I don't recognise you.
I thought you were a kind, loving girl but there's...
There's nothing left.
You're a shell.
She's very troubled.
You have to understand that.
She likes you very, very much.
She doesn't care about me.
I may as well be dead like Walter.
I hate her.
Robert, I need your help.
He had a shotgun, and he was there, and one of these will prove it.
I can leave an amber light on, but are you...
I’ll be fine.
If you could just lift them.
That's good.
The dark used to bother me.
Later, of course, it came to mean safety, no sniper fire, or...
- Thank you.
- ...shells, but as a lad I’d huddle into my bed, wanting to see what was there but too frightened to open my eyes.
Thank you.
It's never darker than when we close our eyes and yet we keep them shut.
Why is that?
Thank you.
The motion's not blurred, so even if he's moving one of these will have him clearly.
Why do you keep your eyes closed, Florence?
Where is he?
Oh, God.
No.
You're real.
I am.
Why are these things here?
What do they want with me?
Maybe they aren't here for you.
Tom, stay here. Do not leave this room.
No! No! No!
Open the door.
Have you left this room?
Something's happened to Florence.
- Promise me you'll stay here.
- All right.
Tom!
I promise.
Maud! Florence!
I saw you.
I saw you with him.
The war hero.
I don't know what you...
I’ve seen plenty through these windows making my rounds, but never that.
Women. Just lap up the sob stories, don't you?
They were sent, you know.
They didn't sign up.
Suddenly they're heroes.
How dare you!
You did nothing, and you think you can mock men like him?
You take care of what you're saying.
You did... You did nothing when men gave every...
No!
Robert! Robert!
Whatever happened?
What's happened, Florence?
- Florence, what is it? My darling girl!
- Florence!
Judd attacked me.
He tried to... He tried to...
I think I killed him.
- I think I killed him.
- Maud, get a blanket.
And run a bath. Now, please.
Where? Where's Judd?
By the trees at the end of the driveway.
No, go inside. Get to Maud and stay there. You hear?
Robert. Robert, don't tell Tom.
Tom?
Little Tom. He's frightened enough.
He's the only child here.
Florence, there are no children here.
It's just us three!
What?
Mowa-Zee.
Mowa-Zee.
Mowa-Zee.
Mowa-Zee.
I didn't mean to scare Walter that night.
I know.
I believe you.
You can control that?
Sometimes I can.
But I don't know why he could see me.
No one sees me.
I can't make them.
We see what we need to.
He needed a friend.
So did I.
But you were frightened. When you heard the music from that rabbit doll you said someone was going to get you.
- Who were you frightened of?
- I can't tell you.
Please. Tell me, please.
You have to see for yourself.
It's the only way we can be together.
Again.
What?
Promise you won't go away again.
Mousie.
Mow-zee?
Look at the doll's house. Look at it.
- No.
- You started to remember,
- I know you did.
- No.
Look at it. You'll remember the rest.
- Look at it.
- I don't want to look.
You started to remember, I know you did.
Look at the house.
- I don't want to look! Get away from me!
- Look at the house.
Mousie.
You started to remember!
You started!
You started to remember!
I know you did!
But you go on and on!
I don't even wanna look at you!
I can't live like this!
Look at it.
You'll remember the rest.
You don't know! You scheme and you laugh at me and plot!
No one is plotting.
It's just that we can't care any more.
You make it impossible to care.
You don't speak for days.
You don't speak to me.
You won't even look at her.
Be quiet. You will be quiet, or so help me!
Your own child?
You despise her.
- You're a monster!
- She's not a boy!
She's bright, and she's sweet, and she's...
- Give me a son! Stay here!
- You have one!
How do you think that makes me feel watching your bastard boy running around with... Your bastard boy running around with Florence!
Leave Tom out of this!
Making us pay because you...
Mummy! Mummy!
Stay back, Florence.
You can't help Mummy now.
Move out of the way!
You can't help Mummy now.
Move out of the way!
You can't help Mummy now.
Move out of the way!
I need you to move out of the way.
Please, Daddy.
Mousie, Mousie, run! Run!
Think I don't know your little hiding places?
Know where my little mouse hides herself for hours on end?
Little Mousie.
Little Mousie.
I really am sorry, Little Mousie.
I will find you, darling.
You have to go with Mummy now.
Mousie.
Mousie.
Little Mousie.
You never said school.
From the moment you arrived, you called this place a house.
You, nanny.
Tom's mother.
I thought bringing you here would be enough.
But you didn't remember me, let alone the terrible things.
I knew your little mind had blacked it all out.
But one thing kept me certain.
You saw him.
You saw my...
My darling murdered child, who's lived here all these years with friends he could never have.
I was his friend.
We shared everything.
A father, everything.
But you needed to see.
That's why I sent Tom to frighten you those times.
To make you stay.
Because I know what's best for you.
I always did.
Because I raised you.
I wet-nursed you.
I watched you taken away, adopted.
You were ripped from me like my boy had been.
I never asked anything of the world.
And it's a perfect hell on earth to give a woman children to love and to rob her of them.
Little Tom.
Little Tom.
I’d forgotten everything.
Well, perhaps not everything.
"Eaten by lions."
Well, all memories are a hoax of some sort.
You can't blame anyone for letting you believe that one.
Mmm.
You needn't worry.
No one will find Judd's body.
I’ve buried better men than him.
You see your own ghosts, too?
Are they with us now?
Your friends.
They look like my friends.
They don't have the right.
No amount of guilt deserves the pain you inflict on yourself.
- They died. I lived.
- No, you didn't.
A life haunted isn't a life at all.
We may as well be ghosts ourselves.
Light a fire, get some glasses.
Someone once told me it makes one cross and sick.
Tom, what... What is it? What's wrong?
Mother said it would be all right.
She said that you would want us to.
The loneliest boys are starting to see Tom now, but will he listen to me?
Will he hide? He needs you.
Maud, I’m going home.
Imagine what a fright you gave me going in the lake like that before you saw the truth.
But it's all right now.
Because he can have you forever.
Everything in its place.
Maud knows best.
Robert!
Florence?
- Florence?
- Mr Mallory!
Florence and I will be leaving now.
Tom needs his family with him.
Florence? Florence?
Robert, the medicine cabinet in Maud's room. Quickly.
Something to make me sick.
Something to make me sick.
Oh, God! No! No!
Tom?
Tom?
Don't be angry,
I just miss you.
All the time.
My whole life I’ve never been happy, not one second since you left me.
But I can't... I can't... I can't come.
You know that, don't you?
You're the only friend I’ve ever had.
But if I go with you now, my soul will never be happy, and I...
I can be, thanks to you.
But you won't need me.
No one will need me.
Tom, you must be brave.
Can you move through the house like there are no walls?
No walls and no floors.
Help her, help her, help her!
Then fly, little Tom.
Fly.
Are you dead?
Are you dying?
I don't know.
I need to sleep.
I need to close my eyes.
I’ll stay with you.
I promise.
Even if you can't see me.
I can...
I can feel you now.
I’ll tell the boys it was an accident, of course.
They'll be devastated. They adored her.
We all did. Uh-uh-uh.
I can only think the Walter incident hit her harder than we thought.
Mind you, the Cathcart girl didn't help.
I suspect she wasn't altogether well herself.
You know, I read a study last term.
Ladies minds often can't cope with further education.
I know you're there.
That's more than your headmaster does.
I used to play here.
Hide and seek.
She would...
Maud would sit over there.
I’m thinking of writing another book.
The Interpretation of Ghosts.
Oh, God help us.
Victor, do your laces.
- Hello.
- Hello, again.
Actually, Robert, can you tell the driver to wait for me at the end of drive?
I like the walk.
I always have.
Till Saturday week.
Not seeing them...
It's not the same as forgetting.
It isn't.
- Hello.
- Hello.
At the midpoint on the journey of life,
I found myself in a dark forest, for the clear path was lost.
I cannot well recount how I entered the wood, so long had it been since I abandoned the true way.
How shall I say what a dreary and horrid wood it was?
So bitter to endure that death itself would be but little worse.
Several times upon my journey home,
I had sensed an unseen rider trailing my steed.
Yet, when I approached, the rider vanished, leaving no trace.
I feared this figure as an evil omen.
All my life I've known such signs and portents.
And lo, at the rise of the hill,
I saw a spotted leopard, all teeth and fury.
At the sight of these beasts, my heart sank.
I sensed danger not for myself, but for my beloved Beatrice.
Away, demon!
I drove my steed on, racing for my father's villa.
And Beatrice... nothing in this world meant more to me than she.
You were right, Dante.
Truly this is a divine place.
Paradise on Earth.
Beatrice, will you take my hand in marriage, under God and all that is holy?
Dante, I will not marry you only to see you dead in this crusade.
Jerusalem must be made Christian once more.
God is with us. We cannot fail.
Through three years of war and horror, my love for Beatrice had only grown stronger.
As I came upon the family estate,
I found all unnaturally dark and still.
Fearing the dreaded omens, I entered.
The servants. All butchered.
Father. Oh, Father.
Beatrice! Lord, let her be alive!
In the name of God.
Where is...
Oh, no. No.
Beloved, are you all right?
Beatrice.
Is it you or a dream?
Who did this to you?
I know not.
A stranger. A foreigner.
Do you remember that night before you left?
What we said?
I remember.
Did you betray me?
Never.
I never should have left your side.
Forgive me.
What?
Do my eyes deceive me?
Fear not for me, my love.
I told him you would be true to me.
I knew you would.
No! Wait! Come back to me!
What is this?
God in Heaven!
What? Dante?
She is mine.
No!
I have come to take what was promised me... a soul meant for Heaven.
It can't be true.
Dante would never betray me.
Beatrice!
Release her, devil!
Dante, help me!
No!
This will not stop me!
Nothing will stop me!
No!
What?
No!
God, give me strength!
Come with me, mortal, if you have the courage.
Dante, don't let him take me!
Beatrice!
You will not keep me from my beloved!
Dante, you lied to me! I trusted you!
You've got to save me! Dante!
I'm coming for you!
I won't let him hurt you!
Beatrice! No!
- Martyr.
- You lost her.
- Martyr.
- You lied to her.
You lost her.
Never will you know her flesh again.
Never will you know her love.
Her sin.
- Martyr. Martyr.
- You lost her!
- Her desire.
- You lied to her.
- Your sins.
- Never will you know her flesh again.
Your sins.
Never will you know her flesh.
You are bound.
- Martyr.
- You lied to her.
- Martyr.
- Martyr.
Why, God?
Why are you doing this?
It is not the Lord that brought you to this fate, Dante.
What are you? Shade or living man?
Not man, though once I was.
I lived under Augustus in the time of the false and lying gods.
Are you not Virgil, glory of the poets?
He who wrote the Aeneid, the treasure of Rome?
Why do you seek such woe, Dante?
I seek only my beloved Beatrice and nothing more.
But I cannot open these accursed gates!
Have you lost all faith in God, O man?
Has the way been so obscured?
Heavenly Father, if only one soul should be saved, please let it be Beatrice.
Help! Help!
Dante, if you broke your promise to me,
I'll be forever damned.
Are you prepared to be judged in this place?
Do you think you are without sin?
Please, don't let him take me!
Beatrice. Beatrice!
What did Beatrice do to deserve such a monstrous fate?
She made a wager with Lucifer to see your safe return.
She lost.
Wager. What wager?
Lucifer bet that you would betray her love.
I never betrayed her.
You only deceive yourself, mortal.
By all that is holy, I vow to forsake all pleasures of the flesh until I return from this noble crusade.
I gave myself to you because I know you will be faithful to our love.
And when I return, we shall be married.
And live to grow old and see our grandchildren have children.
I love you more than Heaven itself.
- Take this.
- But, Beatrice, this has been in your family for generations.
It is a true relic said to contain a thorn from the crown of Christ.
Bring it back to me.
Great Virgil, lead me into the Inferno.
I beg of you, please!
I must save Beatrice even if it means my death.
I will guide you, but you must put aside all division of spirit and gather your soul against all fear.
I fear nothing.
Then proceed.
Charon will carry us to the first circle of Hell, Limbo.
Nine circles comprise the Inferno, with Lucifer residing in the lowest.
Horrifying, yes.
There are more damned in Hell... than liberated in Paradise.
I can see their sins in life.
Charon's boat has grown wide and mighty over the millennia.
He has had to compensate for the ever-increasing damned.
Through me the way to the city of woe.
Through me the way to everlasting pain.
I don't like the look of this.
Now shall I ferry you into the fire, the cold and the everlasting darkness.
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.
How could God allow this?
God allowed free will, even for his angels.
It was Lucifer that devised such torment.
Mercenaries of Florentina, in payment for reclaiming the Holy Land, your Immaculate Father hereby absolves you of all your sins.
Go with grace.
Praise God.
Do you think a priest has such divine power?
Can he truly absolve us of sins so easily?
Of course, Francesco.
Why would you doubt the Church?
That is the path to Hell, my friend.
How soon until you leave?
Tomorrow, before dawn.
Dante, promise to watch over my brother.
Beatrice, I'm no child.
No harm will come to him, my love.
I'll protect him as if he were my own.
You who are living, be gone from those who are dead.
I will not part, Charon!
I must cross!
I give you my soul to find Beatrice!
It belongs to us already, mortal.
Your will is nothing, mortal.
You will never traverse the circles of Hell.
Take me to Beatrice, demon!
Virgil, where did you disappear to?
I am pure spirit, Dante.
I cannot help you fight your enemies.
I am naught but a guide.
Dante! Can you hear me?
Can anyone hear me?
Dante?
Thank God.
I knew you would find me.
Dante?
Beatrice, my love.
Is... Is that you?
No! Dante!
No, stop! Stop, Dante!
What's happening?
How many ways can a man die?
No!
Come to me, Beatrice.
- I want to admire you.
- No. Let me go.
There is not only suffering in Hell, my love.
There are untold pleasures here, pleasures your human senses could not fathom.
Never!
There is nothing you can do to hurt me, child.
What you perceive of me is a literal shadow of my former self, but you... you can die a thousand deaths by my will.
What?
Think of the tortures I can create for such a pure, delicate, angelic soul.
Tell me more about your life on Earth, great poet.
I know your deeds, but not the man you were.
Publius Vergilius Maro was my name.
I was the son of a commoner, and though I died a dozen years before the birth of Christ,
I foretold his coming in my works.
What is this place, Virgil?
The first circle of the Inferno, Limbo.
Here suffer those that did not sin, yet did not have the required faith.
This is the realm where virtuous pagans and unbaptized babies reside.
A child? Here?
How can this be?
Dearest Dante.
This is the fourth letter I have written and the fourth I have destroyed.
I am five months with child.
I fear telling your father as we have yet to be married.
I do not know how much longer
I can conceal my state.
All I ask is that you return to me soon.
Leave this terrible crusade, and we... we can be married.
My lady, what is it?
The baby.
This is my son.
Oh, Beatrice, I didn't know.
Come. Quickly, Dante.
This is not a place to contemplate.
What madness is this?
Lord, too many.
Virgil. Virgil!
In here, Dante. Hurry.
What is that sound?
More demons?
No.
They are familiar to me.
The great rulers and philosophers of the golden age.
Is that not Hector and Electra?
Caesar and King Latinus?
And do not forget Plato,
Socrates and Aristotle.
I have never agreed to such terms.
I say that God exists in the realm of ideas, accessible to human thought.
Plato, there is only one philosophy in the Inferno - Lucifer's.
Do not look for liberation here, old friend.
- Do you know this shade?
- He was Saladin, a noble Kurdish sultan.
I fought his forces in the Crusades under Richard the Lionheart.
Filthy heretic, Jerusalem is ours.
We will wash these holy lands in your heathen blood.
Father...
Mercy, noble knight. She's only a child.
Dante! Dante, the forces of Saladin are routed!
Dante?
My God, what is it?
He is King Minos.
Once a king of Crete before Daedalus boiled him in his own bath.
Now, Minos forever judges the damned, sending them to their circle below.
- Through him...
- Traitor.
...all must pass.
Heretic.
Glutton.
Hoarder.
Suicide!
Who comes into my house of pain?
He who seeks Beatrice.
Let me pass, that I may find her.
Turn back.
There is no place for you here.
Not yet, O mortal.
With your permission or not,
I pass, monster.
You dare so speak to the judge of the damned?
I dare.
I will judge you to the lowest circle of Hell.
Lucifer shall devour you for eternity!
Silence, Minos. It is his fate to proceed.
Here you must descend.
The damned are trying to flee.
Lucifer will not be pleased.
Let him come.
If these demons can die in the Inferno, then so can he.
What is this place?
This is the second circle, the circle of Lust.
To this torment are condemned the carnal damned.
They are the great lustful of the world.
See there Semiramis and Ninus,
Anthony and Cleopatra,
Helen of Troy and Paris.
The storms of lust forever rage while passion inflames the heart.
Listen, on the wind.
- Dante, help me.
- Beatrice!
Please, Dante.
Dante.
- Beatrice!
- Dante, hold.
Beatrice!
A new visitor arrives, sisters.
Come, embrace us, Dante.
We know what you want.
We can see it in your eyes.
Unbearable lust.
No, let me pass.
Stand aside, harlot.
If you won't have us, we shall have you!
Dante, how could you let this happen?
How could you betray me?
No, Beatrice. I swear.
What do you swear, Dante?
Do you want me to show her the truth?
Serpent. It's all lies.
I never betrayed her.
I'll kill you!
You can hide from neither memory nor sin, Dante.
What? King Richard wants us to stand guard over 3,000 prisoners?
That is his command?
He will negotiate their exchange for the return of the true Cross.
Negotiate with heretics?
Never! They deserve only damnation.
Get your hands off her.
Infidel scum. We'll show you not to defy us.
Good and noble knights, have mercy.
I beg you!
This prisoner only tried to save me from the guards.
Please, sir, show compassion.
He is no threat.
He is a heretic.
He gets what he deserves.
Kind lord, if you would show him mercy perhaps I could give you comfort in return.
What comfort could you give a soldier of God?
The nights here are lonely and cold, my lord, even for a soldier of God.
Perhaps I could warm thee.
Dante, do not commit this wicked sin.
How is it a sin if I am already absolved?
Guards, hold.
Thank you, Lord. You are kind.
I could see it in your eyes.
And your promise of comfort?
How could you do that to me... to us?
I was weak. The war changed me.
You know who I am inside.
We've known each other since childhood.
Does she know you, Dante, or did the Crusades show her your true self?
Beatrice! Forgive me!
Please forgive me.
No, it's not true.
He wouldn't do this to me.
Dante!
What did I say?
Even the purest of souls can be corrupted.
Dante is not the man you once knew.
You did this to him.
You corrupted his heart.
I've had no need to influence humanity for many millennia, my dear.
I simply introduced sin.
Man is the one who has spread it like a disease, cultivating it, empowering it.
It is not our fault, none of it.
Man is good.
No, you don't understand.
The Earth is another form of Hell, and men are its demons.
I failed her, Virgil. I betrayed her.
I could blame the Crusades, but I know it was my own weakness, my own sin.
Have you considered she is not the only soul you are here to save?
I seek only my beloved Beatrice, and nothing more.
It is Cerberus, guardian of the third circle, Gluttony.
That is the foulest fate one could ever imagine.
And it is your fate as well, for the true circle of Gluttony lies inside of Cerberus's body.
Inside? Good Lord, isn't there perhaps a way around it?
No, not if you wish to reach fair Beatrice.
So be it! For her I will conquer even this.
Face me, wretched creature!
Release me, demon!
Hell can get no more horrible than this place.
I find this circle most unpleasant.
You're a shade.
You should try wearing skin.
Such a fate. Look at them all.
How could such harmless sin provoke such everlasting torment?
The gluttons - what they could not satisfy in life, in death they shall be denied for eternity.
Dante. Do you remember me, Dante?
I too am from Florence.
You were born before I died.
I do not know you, spirit.
You know me. I am Ciacco.
Gluttony was my offense, and here I remain mere skin and bones.
Can you help me, free me from this agony?
Please, please.
Your suffering weighs heavy on my heart, spirit. Be free.
Virgil, what's happening?
How dare you free the damned?
They deserve torment for wasting their fleeting precious lives.
And Beatrice? Does she deserve torment?
She is the exception.
A pure soul to remind me of my place in Heaven, to remind me of the light of my father.
But let me ask you, Dante, what of your father?
Beatrice, you must eat.
I have no appetite.
I know you miss my son, but you must keep up your constitution, child.
You're nothing but bone.
It's unappealing for a lady.
Beatrice, what have you done to yourself?
It's just another memory, Dante.
Your father's memory.
- My father?
- He is here with us, Dante.
Would you like to visit him?
Do these tortures never end?
Virgil, Beatrice is not here.
We must escape this beast!
What is this?
Cerberus's black heart.
Destroy it, quickly.
Beatrice!
More gold than I've ever laid eyes upon.
What could one man do with so much treasure?
This is the fourth circle - Greed.
All the Earth's treasure that is beneath the moon or ever was cannot give relief to these weary souls.
What a mockery is made of the brief battle for possessions that makes so short a life.
These damned remind me of my father.
What? Where are my last three coins?
Dante?
Dante!
Bella!
Yes, husband.
I'm short three crowns.
Are you stealing from me, woman?
No, Alighiero,
I would never do such a thing.
Liar!
I knew I'd have to watch you.
Now, tell me where you've hidden it, woman, before I throttle you dead.
Don't hit her! Mother!
Can you believe that in my youth
I wanted to be a poet?
But all I ever knew was violence.
And what became of your mother?
She died of a fever a year later.
It was sudden and terrible.
There is no room to pity the dead here, son.
Lucifer did not lie, but then again how could you not be here, Father?
You think you're a greater man than me?
That you're above reproach for your sins?
I took up the Crusade.
The priest absolved us.
And you actually believed him?
No man can absolve you of your sins, but some men can be rewarded in Hell.
Lucifer offered me a thousand years free of torture and endless gold if I would slay my own son.
And where will you spend this gold, Father?
Let me pass. I only seek Beatrice.
So be it.
I always despised you.
But you became me, son.
You belong here. You always have.
So I can be damned in Hell with you?
Never!
It's time to claim my prize, boy.
Then claim it.
You want gold, Father?
It's yours.
I cannot go on.
You must, Dante.
Steel yourself.
The journey is not half over.
How do I know you're not another enemy sent by Lucifer?
You could be luring me to my doom all along.
Another trick, another deception.
Search inside yourself.
You know I was sent here from on high.
Forgive me, Virgil.
This place has affected my mind.
Let us move on.
Please, Lord.
Forgive me of my transgressions.
Save me from this horrible torment.
Please, I beg of you.
My God.
I have heard your prayers, beloved Beatrice, and I have come for you.
There is no escape, little soul.
Your prayers are worthless here.
Rejoice, child, for you are about to be granted a rare privilege in the Inferno.
I am making you my bride.
You will become the Queen of Hell.
Are you not pleased?
I cannot stand this wretched place.
For we are in the fifth circle, Anger.
The very air reeks of fury.
Watch your ankles.
More food! We're starving!
We need more food.
We're doing the best we can.
There isn't enough food to go around.
Quiet! Quiet down!
There is nothing we can do.
The granaries are ablaze.
We barely have enough rations for our own men.
Then I'm leaving this post.
I will not put up with guard duty any longer.
You can't do that, Dante.
We came here to kill these heretics, not coddle them.
We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
Saladin took the city last year and spared Christian lives.
We should do the same.
Since when are heretics worth a Christian life?
Enough. Enough!
Keep your mind, Dante.
Do not dwell on past deeds here.
See the souls over whom anger has prevailed.
In the black sludge of the River Styx do they wish they had never been born.
The fools. It is here we must cross.
We travel in that?
Perhaps we would be safer swimming.
I suppose it doesn't get much sturdier.
Is this a friend of yours, great poet?
Phlegias is the guardian of the Styx.
He was the son of Ares and a king in his day.
Hold on.
The ride will be somewhat bumpy.
The angry souls know no end to their fury.
Who are you that comes here before your time?
If I come, I do not remain.
But I know you, hell dog, filthy as you are.
You were Filippo Argenti in life.
Come down, Dante, and face your old enemy!
Let the damned rip you to shreds, wretch.
Now, my son, the City of Dis draws near, housing its solemn citizens within.
Damned of Dis rejoice, for your lord, Lucifer, is betrothing the pure soul, Beatrice.
Truly this will be a marriage of Heaven and Hell.
Hurry, Phlegias! Run!
Beatrice!
Outcasts of Heaven, race despised, why do you rail against a will that cannot be stopped?
Dante?
He has taken her into the tombs.
Hurry, Dante.
Gone. Why does he do this?
Bait us on? Keep us running?
Perhaps Lucifer wants your soul as well as Beatrice's.
He's luring us to the ninth circle.
- What is this place?
- The tombs of heresy.
Here in the sixth circle you will find endless heretics burning in eternal fire.
O Tuscan, who walks through this place speaking so decorously, know that I am Farinata.
Farinata, another hated man in life.
What do you want, spirit?
Know this.
The damned can foresee the future but can never know the present.
Your future, Dante, is filled with death and destruction.
Beatrice will marry Lucifer and reign in Hell, and you will be damned with us forever.
I never liked him.
What's happening?
The harrowing of Hell.
Christ's death forever quakes this circle.
We must hurry.
Let me go. What do you want from me?
I have taken countless brides over the millennia -
Cleopatra, Salome, Helen of Troy.
But, unlike them, your spirit is pure, unspoiled.
I will never succumb to you.
Kill me again and again, slit my throat, tear me to pieces, but I will never love you.
Yes, such passion.
You have a fire inside you.
After we are properly married, you will give me a brood to carry on my legacy.
You will be birthing my children for eternity, sweet soul.
Virgil, do you hear...
Who is this new monster?
What does he want?
The minotaur guards passage into the seventh circle.
Be cautious, Dante.
How dare you threaten us?
Do you think he is the duke of Athens who served up your death above?
Off with you.
Begone, abomination!
Virgil, I think you've made him angry.
Now, while he is blind with rage.
Hold fast. Steady.
Now move!
You have many surprises, poet.
Perhaps you would have made a great warrior in life.
It was nothing. He was all horn, no brains.
This circle is reserved for the violent.
Those who have done violence against others forever boil in the blood they have shed.
How shall we cross?
It's impossible.
You summoned me, great Virgil.
Greetings, Nessus.
We need passage across the bloody
Phlegethon. Can you help us?
Of course. Climb and hold on tightly.
The river is treacherous.
Here is Alexander, Dionysius, Attila, and countless others.
The damned here are worse off than the Styx.
These were the kings of bloodshed and despoilment.
Be wary of the next passage, friends.
My thanks, Nessus.
Good luck to you, mortal soul.
We must hurry. Beatrice can wait no longer.
This is no forest.
Yes, they are those who did violence to themselves.
- This is the wood of suicide.
- Dante...
- No, my friend! Turn back!
- Come to me, Dante.
Come to me, Dante.
Come to me.
Why do you break me?
Have you no pity?
Mother?
Yes, son.
I too am among the damned.
But how can this be?
When a soul takes its own life,
Minos judges it to this circle.
Here it sprouts, shoots up like a sapling.
No body, only pain.
No, Mother, you don't belong here.
You died of fever.
Her heart gave out from the fever.
She was just too fragile.
Where is she now, Father?
In Paradise, son, with all the souls of pure light.
I despised your father's cruelty, but I was too weak to defy him.
And so, I...
I took my...
You learned your father's ways, but you are not lost.
You can redeem yourself.
Beatrice was all I had.
How could I have betrayed her?
The pain you endure purifies you, son.
Heed my words. You must look into your deepest sin to save her.
And what of you?
Only the living can redeem themselves.
I cannot.
This is too cruel a punishment for you, Mother.
God must know this is not your fault.
I'm going to free you.
My soul belongs to God now, son.
We are still in the seventh circle?
Yes, the Abominable Sands.
It is here the damned did violence against God.
We came here to kill these heretics.
We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
Saladin took the city last year and spared
Christian lives. We should do the same.
Since when are heretics worth a Christian life?
Enough. Enough!
Dante, no!
Fight with me, Crusaders.
Spill the blood of these heathens.
Their souls are already lost.
Dante, what have you done?
Crusaders? Here?
Why are you being punished?
Our cause was holy.
We are absolved of sin.
The bishop lied, did he not, brother?
Francesco, not you too.
God never condones violence of any kind.
There was no holy war.
Don't you understand?
The priests lied.
Of all people, how could you be here?
It was you! You did this to me!
No, no, no, listen.
You don't deserve the life given to you, you don't deserve Beatrice, and now you will join us here forever where you belong.
Brother.
I am not your brother.
You're an animal, Dante.
A monster!
I will not let you have her.
You know I'm the better swordsman, Dante.
It's over. Justice is inevitable.
Not yet.
He can rest for a while, but he is forever bound here like a shadow of time unforgotten.
He was a good man.
He doesn't deserve such suffering.
Heavenly Father, let the soul of Francesco rise into your divine Paradise.
What?
Pray for your own soul, Dante, for it will freeze with me forever in Cocytus below.
I'll kill you in your own circle, Devil.
Yes, a contest.
Hurry, Dante. Your beloved Beatrice is soon my queen.
This is the union of the three great rivers of Hell.
Another beast I must slay?
No, Dante. Geryon is our passage to the eighth circle.
Climb inside. And be wary - it bites.
My thanks, Geryon.
This way, Dante.
We are in the circle of Fraud which one commits upon those who trust in him.
You must travel these ten malebolge alone.
And quickly - Beatrice is soon to wed.
Alone? What of you, great poet?
I will not be far, believe me.
You have proven yourself worthy.
Now hurry, Dante, lest you lose your love forever.
I traveled on alone, over the flatterers and simonists, and as I ran I was overwhelmed with my sins as if every malebolge was a chasm of memory.
I felt my mind weakening with every step, and yet I would not cease.
Release that one.
His ransom has been paid.
My ransom?
No. No, you didn't...
You defiled yourself with him, didn't you?
Didn't you? You whore.
You have shamed me.
You are not my wife, do you hear?
Filthy whore. Whore!
I'll kill you. You bastard dog, I'll kill you.
I swear I'll kill you.
You bastard. You'll see everyone you ever loved dead by my hand.
Dead, dead!
No, it can't be.
I have come for the woman.
No!
Leave her alone. She's innocent.
Run, Beatrice, run!
Get out of my house, filthy dog.
- Get away from me!
- There is no escape for you.
Stay back.
No!
Vengeance is finally mine.
It was me. Beatrice's death.
They were all murdered because of me.
At last, Dante, now you both see the truth.
You are the true cause of
Beatrice's suffering, and the damnation of so many others.
How could you have done such evil to me?
Tear the heart from my chest, rip the very soul from my body?
These sins are my own.
You have no right to Beatrice.
Relinquish her.
Never! Dwellers, night fiends, and torturers of the pit, strip the flesh from the mortal's bones.
Lucifer!
Beatrice, stop!
You don't know what you're doing!
I thought I knew many things.
I thought love was real, but it was only an illusion, a fraud.
There is nothing left for me in all of God's creation.
Yes, my love.
In union, all of Hell's power will be yours.
Beatrice, don't do it!
When you had your way with that girl, you gave me to Lucifer.
It was all because of you.
Beatrice!
No!
No, no.
The faithful has lost her faith.
The incorruptible has become corrupted.
The true innocent has given way to the sins of man, like all the rest before her.
Who can now deny me my rights?
I will leave you with my consort.
She has so much to show you.
This is where you belong, Dante.
You are the greatest fraud of all.
You've lied to me, deceived me, and for that you shall suffer.
Beatrice, don't do this.
You never loved me.
It was all a lie, all of it... our whole life!
Beatrice, listen to me.
I braved the circles of Hell for you.
You mean nothing to me.
But I have faced my sins.
I am ready to take you home.
Faced your sins? Look down, Dante.
Look deep into the ninth circle... the circle of traitors.
God in Heaven, what happened?
Who is responsible for this massacre?
Take care of my sister.
I am responsible.
Hang him, and prepare to march tonight.
When the noble Saladin learns of this atrocity he will bring forth the very forces of Hell.
Take care of Beatrice.
Dante, protect her with your life.
Beatrice, I'm coming home.
I wanted nothing more than to see you and beg for forgiveness.
I will never forgive what you've done, never.
But while I live, I can absolve you.
Forgive me, and free yourself.
My cross.
I brought it back to you.
Accept again the love of God.
Dante.
I forgive you.
I never wanted any harm to come to you.
You have done well, my friend.
And though you may not understand it now, Dante, you have perhaps saved far more than just one innocent soul.
Wait. I can't be separated from her now.
I've come this far.
You cannot claim a place with her yet, Dante.
You have to face the true enemy, in the lowest part of the ninth circle... the circle of traitors.
There, you must face the king of traitors,
Lucifer himself.
He guards your only escape from the Inferno.
We shall be reunited one day. I promise.
Goodbye, my love.
This last trial is for you to face alone.
Godspeed, my friend.
Very well. I am coming for you, Lucifer.
I will make you pay for her suffering.
I am coming for you.
I fell, not into fire, but into a vast, frozen wasteland.
The very center of Hell, furthest place in all of creation from the divine light of God.
Treachery, the ninth circle of the Inferno.
I walked through the darkness, numb with bitter cold.
All about me were forsaken, frozen souls of deceivers and traitors.
Who are you to walk the paths of Hell so warmly, O living man?
Damned soul, where is Lucifer?
Tell me, before I too freeze in this miserable hell.
Wipe the icy tears from my eyes, and I shall tell you.
The Lord of Hell dwells at the center of this frozen lake.
Past the storms of Ptolomea, deep in the center pit of Judecca, there his icy halls are well protected, and none but the mightiest may cleave a path.
But can you believe me?
Can you believe a traitor?
Long did I wander the dim and icy paths of Hell.
Past the frozen giants of legend...
Nimrod, Ephialtes and Antaeus.
I was battered by a frigid wind that was like the beating of Lucifer's black wings.
Finally, after a seeming eternity,
I came to a passage blocked by the frozen links of a mighty chain.
Lucifer thinks he can block my way with this?
He thinks he can stay my vengeance?
Welcome, great Dante.
Welcome to your final resting place, the circle of traitors.
Lucifer, I have come to escape this hell so that I may be reunited with my beloved, but not before I rid the world of your corruption.
You will never see Beatrice again.
The path to Purgatory lies through me.
You are the warrior of a weak and dying God, a God who is the true evil.
His power wanes over the world.
Silence. Your lies have no power over me, Devil.
I will rend the very soul from your frozen body.
Indignant fool.
Come, let me devour your soul as I devoured Judas Iscariot.
You will remain in this pit until creation's last breath, do you hear?
Never!
You are not invincible here.
You are just another demon and, like any fallen, you can be destroyed.
You cannot destroy me!
What have you done to me?
I have slain you, great beast.
Victory is mine.
What's this?
New life writhes inside him.
No!
Thank you, Dante. I am very impressed.
Many have tried, but all have failed me.
Ulysses, Alexander, Attila, Lancelot...
Truly, you are the greatest of all my minions.
Minion? I do not serve you.
Speak without your forked tongue, serpent!
Do you not?
You freed me from my eternal torment.
I came only for Beatrice.
Beatrice? She was only bait.
It was you I wanted all along.
Don't you see?
I was bound by God in this frozen pit, only my shadow self allowed to roam free.
It took a mortal to release me - you, Dante.
No, it isn't true!
I defeated you before.
Show me the path from Hell, or I will end your miserable existence.
Destroy an angel of God?
You arrogant gnat.
Such vanity, such pride.
I could have slain you the moment you fell into Hell.
You worship God, but it was He who created evil.
It was He who created me.
If you knew the true nature of God, Dante, you too would rebel.
No!
You are nothing to me. A talking animal.
He made you in His image... and I was to bow down to you?
I grow weary of this game.
Finally, I will reclaim my proper place in Heaven.
Behold, Dante.
Beyond the Inferno lies Purgatory, where awaits your precious Beatrice.
But instead of you,
I shall escape from this pit.
All the souls in Purgatory shall suffer and burn.
And beyond Purgatory, Paradise itself.
I will plunge the cosmos into chaos, and it is all your doing, Dante.
Because of you, God will finally see me rule His creation.
No, I cannot be the cause of this.
There is nothing you can do to stop me, mortal.
No one can stop me.
One can.
Almighty God, forgive me for all of my wicked sins.
I forsake my escape.
I give up even Beatrice.
I belong here, in Hell, and accept my just damnation.
What are you doing?
A repentant soul in Judecca? Stop!
Do not utter a word!
But grant me the power to keep your enemy here with me.
Stop. I command you.
No!
Purgatory.
Beatrice. I will come to you yet.
My love, I have forgiven you.
God will forgive you.
Now forgive yourself.
I fought across Earth and Hell to find my beloved Beatrice.
We were together, neither in Hell nor in Paradise, neither damned nor saved.
I did not die, and I did not live.

Welcome home, Hunter.
This is your house.
Gonna look out of that window.
There's your front door.
Hi, Dad.
How are you?
- Happy.
- Hi, little man.
We got to keep him out of the sun, too, OK?
Yeah. How are you feeling?
Guess who changed the first, like, 15 diapers?
- This guy, right here.
- Wait, wait.
Guess who was in labor for a day?
- This girl.
- I've been in labor for...
- Hi.
- That's your mama.
Hi. Hunter, this is Martine, your new nanny.
She will probably fix your dirty diapers
- because I won't.
- Can I see?
Yes.
Oh, my goodness. Look at this.
- He's cute, right?
- Isn't he adorable?
He's kind of smooshy looking.
I'm not gonna lie.
He's just newborn, he's a newborn...
Seriously, the cutest baby ever, next to me. Second to me.
Just touch him and cuddle him all day long.
You see how tiny he is?
Do you mind if I take him?
Not if he's sleeping, but I want to take him on a tour of the house.
OK. He's not sleeping.
That's Abby.
Gonna be your best friend.
Bye, sweetie.
This is a fireplace.
This is how Mommy seduced Daddy...
- Oh.
- ...and that's how we got you.
And that's why you're watching this video at 25.
This is your room.
There's your crib.
It's a little sparse right now.
Just got some caterpillar action going on.
"Hunter." See? Pretty cool.
This is your sister's trashed room.
- No, I'll check with him.
- Oh, there she is.
Wassup, brother from another mother?
- What?
- No, Hunter's in...
You're never allowed to come in here, ever. Unless I invite you.
In which case, it's gonna be the best day of your life.
By the way, that's my bathroom.
Don't ever go in there.
That's half your bathroom. It's actually my bathroom, 'cause I bought it.
All that is mine.
Don't pee on my seat!
This is the living room that no one ever uses.
Hey, somebody left the front door open!
Nice.
Don't do that, OK?
This is my first man cave.
That's where all my genius ideas come.
This is the second man cave, where we're gonna watch
Chargers games together.
This is my 50-inch monster.
Look at that. It's beautiful.
I don't even know if I swaddled him right.
It's just... Yeah.
Hi, baby boy. Hi.
Hi.
- He smells good.
- Yes.
You're just like Daddy.
You make poops all the time.
- Is that good?
- Si.
OK.
Is a special baby. Si?
- Thank you.
- That is so cute.
I'll get it!
- Hey! Let me see this baby.
- Hi!
- Aunt Katie!
- Where is he?
He's upstairs.
Hi.
Hi. Hi.
You are so precious.
Hi.
I already love you so much.
- My sister did good.
- Yeah.
You probably had a little part in it, I don't know.
- Very little.
- Hi.
It's her boyfriend.
Yeah, he's a big boy, just like his...
Kinda just eating cookies.
Hello, baby.
- Dad, my burger?
- Or whatever.
- Right, sorry.
- Gimme another plate.
- Nice.
- Did you get that?
- I want you to meet my Aunt Katie.
- Wait.
Does it stay on?
It does stay on, but I didn't want to get it wet.
Oh, no, of course not.
That would be ridiculous.
- That would ruin it.
- That is so...
- Swear to God, I will kill you.
- Look at that, perfect.
Perfect handoff right there.
She's my only niece. Not really, but I think of her as my niece.
She's my step-niece.
- I'm the evil step-aunt.
- Step?
The evil step-aunt? I'm not sure how to take that. I'm not sure...
Well, I'm not really evil, but I can be evil is my point.
Dad, the face came off!
- There can be only one!
- I will not let you go.
I can't believe he's over a year old.
Where's Micah?
Oh, he...
He wasn't up for hanging out today.
I can't find the tape.
That's fine, I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place has been just destroyed.
Nothing seems to be missing.
It's just, everything's really...
But that's what she's telling me.
Make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
This is our foyer.
The furniture's damaged.
My daughter Ali's room.
It just feels... gross that somebody was in here.
Master bedroom.
Yeah, so that's great.
- Your watches are still there?
- Yeah.
Diamonds are here.
The only thing missing is the necklace my sister made me.
Oh, sweetie.
This is horrible. It's fucking horrible.
It's the nursery.
As far as I know, this room was not touched.
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't know if there's anything...
I don't think they did anything down here. I... What is that?
Is that Abby?
It really stinks, though.
- Oh.
- Well, clothes are still here.
Your bikes are still here.
Not that you're using those.
And your bike is over here, so...
And the epic clean continues.
This looks like we had a party.
Right?
Worst party ever.
I don't know, kiddo.
This is messed up.
What are you talking about?
They didn't take anything. We're fine.
You're fine.
So this is it.
Like I said, about a week ago,
- the place was completely trashed.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- That's our daughter, Ali.
Pretty much every room in the house.
We had both doors locked.
Put one up here, up in the corner, and then you get the whole stairway, the front door, this whole hallway.
One over there, facing this way, you'd get this door and this door.
Or have one in here, getting all these windows, the sliding...
They run, like, all the time?
Yeah, they're always recording.
You can't get away with anything.
That stuff.
Corner up there, so you get who's coming in and out
- of this door, that door.
- Bathroom.
And you get to see the baby at night, too.
You're not putting one in my bathroom, right?
- Yeah. What?
- Wait.
Put a camera that sees in complete dark.
It'd be perfect.
- Yeah, really?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.
- Yeah, OK, that'd be sweet.
- They'll look like motion detectors.
Little tiny hole.
I have one I could show you.
- Can you put one in that bunny?
- Very cool.
And then we can,
I can set you up with the...
Yeah, so, I'm gonna close it up there like that.
It's hidden.
Can't even tell it's a camera.
How many are we getting?
I don't know. But what'd you...?
What, is that... six?
- I don't know.
- One, two, three...
What are you doing out here, little buddy?
Yeah. Go get it.
You're super fast, big man.
What's Martine doing?
What is she doing?
He's good, right?
You're a good puppy.
What you say, Abby?
Hey, Hunter. Hunter, you want another fishy?
What are you doing?
What you doing?
Oh, buddy, I think it's time for N-A-P.
What do you think?
Yeah?
Come on. Come here, buddy, let's move this first.
OK. Aw, that's a good baby.
That's a good baby. OK.
Oh! You gotta help me out here, buddy.
Thank you.
That's a good boy.
OK.
I know. Everything's fine, you're just superbaby.
Did you do this all by yourself? Man,
Daddy's gonna be so proud.
OK, I'll just clean up the rest of it when I bring you back.
What's up, Martine?
Wassup? What's up, Ali?
What were you doing?
What were you doing earlier?
When you were, like, talking to yourself?
All crazy like.
Are you going crazy here, too?
- No... crazy.
- You're just getting it from all of us.
The house is...
There are bad things in the house?
No.
- You're getting rid of spirits. OK.
- Uh-huh.
All right.
The good ones...
- We keep the good ones.
- Yes.
In with the good, out with the bad.
In with the paella, out with the...
Holy crap, that's a lot of garlic.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Oh, I almost got him.
One, two...
Oh, my God!
Look at what Martine left!
- Oh!
- Disgusting! I wanna throw up! It...
She put it in the freaking...
- No, you! That was you!
- It's not me!
- Don't blame somebody else!
- Hand to God!
God, there was like a live crawdaddy in there.
- She clogged it. I can't look.
- That is a stench-ilada.
- That is horrible. You're grounded.
- I'm not capable of...
You are grounded. Awful.
This is the best bath...
- It looks pretty good.
- ...I've... I think it...
Well, if you come in, it'll be the best bath I've ever...
It's so quiet and, like, there's nobody here. It's fantastic.
I love Martine, but I'm kind of loving the fact that she's not here.
- Yeah.
- What time is your sister coming?
What time is it now?
7:20. Something like that.
Oh, like an hour or so.
You should definitely pop in.
I don't want to smash you, but I kind of want to get in.
You don't want to smash me?
I kinda want you to smash me.
- Really? Oh.
- Yeah.
Let me release the Kraken.
Hey.
You're OK.
I gotcha.
You're OK. You're OK.
Look, it's perfect, right?
- That's a lot of grease in there.
- I'm gonna drain it.
Here, goofy mug.
Do you need anything?
- Hey!
- Are you making breakfast?
- Thank you so much.
- How you doing?
- I was, but, uh...
- Hola.
- Did he keep you up?
- Yeah, yeah.
- He definitely kept me up.
- Yeah, he does that.
I love you so much.
- I love you so much.
- Thank you so much.
- I love you so much.
- That's OK. Aw.
You're amazing. I don't think
I'm really awake yet, though.
There's coffee.
I love my sister
She's the best
Remember that time you tried to be a vegan
- for like six hours?
- A day and a half?
- That was a difficult time.
- It was for one meal.
- Making bacon?
- Yeah.
- Good morning.
- Yo, yo, yo, what up?
Thank you for loaning out your beautiful girlfriend for the night.
- What up?
- She made my day.
Tell me that's not yours.
It's not really mine, no.
Thanks for not watching the sausage for us, Ali.
I did watch it!
It's mine and hers.
She uses it most.
Cool. It's HD.
Do I get some love, too?
What?
You scared little Hunter.
How's it going?
Can I get you some coffee?
- Dude, I have a bone to pick with you.
- Yeah?
I went into Burger King, and I was like, hey, man.
I tossed your name around and they didn't give me any free food, dude.
I don't own, like, every Burger King.
He's not actually the king of Burger King.
I'm not?
I'm still in the process of easing him in to the fact that we live together and, therefore, the house should represent the both of us.
Well, yeah, but the both of us, like, a give and take.
Like you have your beading thing or whatever it is, and then I have my area, you know?
- The whole rest of the house?
- Of manliness.
I'm telling you, that baby's gonna be a rock star when he grows up.
Yeah, get it. Whoa!
Dad, careful, are you watching that?
There was no sign of forced entry, but...
They trashed our whole house.
I mean, I think it was more vandalism.
See that thing in the corner?
Looks like a motion detector?
- Are you, like...?
- That's a camera.
We're watching you!
You like little wheels that roll.
You're such a ham.
Such a ham. Are you leaving?
Things have gotten a little difficult since he learned how to open the door.
So are you freaked out after the break in?
Yeah, I mean, I definitely was.
I don't think I was sleeping very well.
Oh, sweetie? Sweetie.
I would be freaked out, too, if, you know, somebody had broken into my house.
Well, it's just, they didn't take anything. You know?
- Yeah.
- I don't know.
It seemed personal.
It feels like they're always still here.
You know? I don't know, I...
I get this feeling, like when we were little.
What?
Never mind.
Mac and cheese, mac and cheese.
Hey, Kris? I'm gonna go out.
I'm not gonna be in.
- Oh, OK. Where are you going?
- Just the mall.
All right, well, have fun.
- Bye!
- Bye!
Mac and cheese.
Mac and cheese.
No?
Hey, what's up there?
Let's look at baby Hunter.
Boy, that one was bad.
That's that bee bonnet that the...
He's like, that was totally humiliating.
Nobody needs to see this.
- Oh, this is crazy.
- What?
- Who do you think that is?
- Is that you?
No, that's your Aunt Katie.
That's...
- That's Katie?
- That's so weird.
I thought we lost all our pictures in the fire.
That's great.
Yo, Martine?
Kristi and Dad are out tonight. I'm going out tonight.
You gonna have your boyfriend over? Have a party?
- Este Brad. Novio.
- Yeah.
He, he boy.
...want handsy, handsy, touchy. No.
"No."
- The handsy, handsy, touchy?
- The handsy-handsy, si.
Is that the kind of dance you were showing me, the Handsy?
Shake it.
I thought I was gonna have to give him the Heimlich.
Hey, what are you doing?
That's enough, Martine.
Put it down.
Martine, he's fine.
I've asked you not to do this, OK?
It is not good for the baby.
Please, put it out right now.
No más, no más.
That's enough.
Put it out right now, please.
OK, that's enough.
What are you doing?
- The baby is fine, OK?
- No, no.
The baby should not be breathing that.
Nobody should.
No, I don't...
Just stop doing it, please.
Goddamn it.
God.
OK, that's like two months.
All right?
- OK? I told you.
- Si.
I do understand, OK? I just,
I don't believe in that stuff,
OK? It's just... I cannot have that stuff in my house. OK?
- OK.
- I'm sorry.
Can I give you a great recommendation, OK?
You were very good for us.
Da-da.
Come on, make Daddy proud.
Say, "Da-da."
Hunter, look over here.
Hunter?
You are so like your dad.
Sweetie. Sweetie?
Come on, come on.
What are you looking at?
Look at Mama.
Look at Mama.
Buddy? What? What? Oh.
Look over here.
There's nothing there, goofball.
Where are you going?
Hunter?
I can't see you back there.
We were up in the nursery, playing, and I was trying to get him to say "Da-da" again, and he just wouldn't focus.
He was looking at the ceiling and mirror, everywhere but me.
Well, he's a baby. He's got an attention span of a guppy. You know?
I guess, but there was definitely something he was focused on, and it wasn't my pretty face.
- Hey.
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.
Check this out.
- Dad, can you please not do that?
- Yeah, night vision.
Cool, I'm gonna get nail polish on the bed. Please?
You got freaky eyes.
You look like a possum.
Dad.
- There we go.
- Painting my nails, Dad.
Why are you in here?
What do you want?
- Sorry, crabby.
- I'm not crabby.
You're Crabby McRumpelstein.
- Why did I fire Martine?
- Yeah.
Because I didn't like her doing all that weird
- witchy stuff around Hunter.
- It wasn't witchy.
It wasn't witchy...
It wasn't hurting anybody.
It made her feel better, and she wanted to make us feel better.
She was, like, slaughtering goats out by the pool, OK?
- No, she wasn't.
- All right.
Good luck and it's... Stay in the lines.
- What? Dad!
- Check it.
- On! Stop!
- Off.
Let me get one more. Oh!
Come here.
Come here, come on.
It's OK.
It's OK, buddy. It's OK.
No.
It's OK, buddy, there's nothing there.
Is that what woke you up, buddy?
Daniel!
Daniel?
God. Nasty.
- Dad, don't pick it up with your hands.
- Why not?
Because it could, like...
They can have diseases and stuff...
- It flew into the window...
- It's so sad.
I don't even want to look at it.
- What?
- Its neck is all broken.
Oh, my God, just put it in the thing!
- I'm trying to...
- Why did you pick it up with tong...?
- I don't know.
- What do you think?
- Stop!
- Medium, medium rare?
- You're really mean.
- It's just a dead bird.
- Oh.
- It was a live bird. And then it...
- It's really sad.
- OK.
You like the ball? You like ball?
Ball, ball, hit it. Smack it!
What's in there? Get in.
What's in there?
Oh, buddy. Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.
Hunter? Oh, shit.
Hunter, come here! Come here.
Fuck!
What are you doing back out here? Go.
Your dog does not like pool cleaners.
Yo, what's the deal with your dog?!
Honestly, we're not really sure.
Splash, splash. One, two, three.
Splash, splash, splash.
This is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.
Splash, splash, splash.
I think I might definitely start to replace my girlfriend with this camera.
- Uh-huh. See? We're scared.
- It's got more features.
Flip the thing, film yourself.
It flips. Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, shit.
- Then it shows you...
No. I'm definitely getting one of these.
I'll bet you guys go extracurricular with this.
Who has time for that?
We've got a baby.
How's Daniel Rey and his brood doing?
Oh, apparently, we have a ghost.
Did you hear about this?
I did not. Please elaborate,
'cause that's a very strange thing to...
A couple pots fell off our pot hanger thing in the kitchen.
- You definitely have a ghost.
- Straight to ghost.
That's the most logical...
She thinks everything is, like, a ghost or a... Don't you, honey?
What?
- Think everything is a ghost?
- You don't have a ghost.
- Yeah, you're definitely haunted.
- No.
You and your sister are, like, freaky...
- Katie, you're into this stuff?
- You don't know this stuff?
They used to do, like, séances and shit when they were little.
- No!
- Yes.
We didn't do séances.
- No.
- Who'd you talk to?
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.
- Katie...
- Babe, it was really no big deal.
- What's no big deal?
- I probably, you know,
I just don't talk about this stuff anymore.
What stuff?
They used to do séances when they were little kids.
It's really not that funny. You're laughing. It's not a big deal, babe.
The truth is, when we were kids, we got a little freaked out, but it's really no big deal.
And we're having a good day today, so let's just...
- We'll explore this in detail later.
- Let's focus...
What about the Lizzie Borden one?
The axe murderer one?
You're thinking of every, like, childhood...
How, where do, how would I...
Back me up...
How would I know this stuff if you didn't tell us?
What's your take on this ghost situation?
I think it's awesome.
Jesus Christ!
Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
There it is.
Ali!
- I thought we said good night, Brad!
- Yeah, no. We did...
- Get the fuck out of here right now!
- I'm not even here.
Ali, did you leave the burner on?
No?
You almost burned the fucking house...
Not cool, Brad.
How could I put it up wrong?
It's on a hook.
- Once it goes up, it's up.
- You were probably putting it on the edge of the top part, instead of inside.
The fact that it fell a second time probably proves
- that you put it up wrong both times.
- OK.
You want me to show you how to put it up?
No, no, no.
Then why are you putting the pool cleaner back in every morning?
For the last week?
'Cause it's a pool cleaner, and I want it to clean the pool.
- How does it get out at night?
- How does it get out?
- Yeah.
- Is it taking the car? Is it...
Oh, come on, honey.
No, really.
I don't know. I assume somebody takes it out when they go swimming.
I don't take it out, and you don't take it out.
Ali, do you take the pool cleaner out of the pool?
- What?
- Do you take the pool
- cleaner out of the pool?
- No.
What? So it's crawling out of the pool?
It's crawling out of the pool by itself?
I don't know. Let's...
You know what?
You wanted all the cameras.
Let's go check the DVR.
Fine, let's go check it.
- You serious?
- Yeah, I'm very serious.
We'll find out what else is going around here at night.
- Can I tape it, though?
- Yeah.
- What?
- See?
That is weird.
Maybe I have it set too high or something, I don't know.
No.
No, I don't, I don't think the settings are off.
Maybe the settings are off.
That's what we got it for.
It's probably trying to be proactive.
Do the little patio.
It's like one of those vacuum cleaner things you set up.
Yeah, it's like a Flowbee, but with...
I don't know if the house is haunted, but I hope it is.
- You hope it is?
- Yeah.
Are you kidding me?
That would be fucking awesome.
Why would you hope that the house is haunted?
That'd be the coolest thing ever.
If there was somebody trying to, like, get through to us,
- that would be amazing.
- No, I just...
Kristi is obviously not sleeping.
Dude.
She doesn't have any...
Her hormones are all kooky.
She's got... paranoid mommy...
...just interpreting them in the wrong way.
Like, she's seeing them as, as harmful and dangerous.
And maybe we should just see them as something trying to, like...
Like, I think we should have a séance.
- We could go full out... What?
- That's a great idea.
Just freaky. I don't...
I don't believe in it.
Why do you think that it necessarily has to be bad, though?
That's all I'm asking.
- How would it be good?
- Like, what if it's Mom?
- Hey, guys.
- What?
There's something you need to see.
- What are you talking about?
- What's going on?
- You're freaking me out.
- You have to see...
Honey, what are you talking about?
What are... you talking about?
What is it?
- I don't see anything.
- I don't understand.
- Yeah!
- That's not funny.
Yeah!
Sweetie?
Come on, that was kind of funny, right?
I just, I hate it when you don't take me seriously.
I'm sorry, honey. I do take you seriously. I was just trying to...
I'm just trying to lighten things up.
I just want us to kind of get back to normal.
Like I was thinking maybe we could go out?
- Like... like grownups?
- Yeah, right.
Right. How am I gonna leave?
Why, why are you laughing? We can go.
- Martine's gone.
- No, Ali can watch the baby.
With the break in, and all the weird stuff going on,
I just don't want to leave him alone.
You know, we can't just let this affect us that much.
If we do that, the terrorists win.
Right?
I miss you, you know?
I miss my wife, the fun wife.
And I know I've been kind of a tool.
And I just wanna...
Oh, my God.
He looks so tired. Look at him.
He's almost passed out.
Yeah, I think somebody has time for a nap. Come here, buddy.
- Bye. Bye, grumpster.
- Oh, I know. Fussy baby.
Fussy fussy.
God! Hot! Oh, man!
Did you leave the heater on in the hot tub?
- No.
- No?
- It's like a million degrees in there!
- No. Why would I...
That was two nights ago, and I turned it off.
- Oh, my God. Are you OK?
- Were you out there with Brad?
- Yeah, two nights ago.
- Honey, honey. What's going on?
It wouldn't be boiling. The highest it goes up to is like 90-something.
Give me something cold.
Like, peas?
- Are you OK?
- God.
God. Boiled my nuts right now.
- What exactly...
- I'm gonna call that guy.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
All right, so all the emergency numbers are in this cabinet.
Yep.
But now his new doctor is in there.
And also his allergist.
- And remember, no peanuts on anything.
- I know, no peanuts.
Make sure the doors and the windows are locked, OK?
Upstairs, in the back, out front, every...
- Go!
- I love you.
- Have a great time with him.
- Bye.
- I love you!
- Bye. Have a good time.
- Take the money. Coming!
- Bye! Say, "Bye, Mama!"
Bye. Bye!
Don't get too wasted!
Bye!
Can you say bye-bye?
Jesus Christ.
- What the...?
- Hello?
- Did I scare you?
- Yes.
Lightly. Have to warm up the board.
You have to warm up the board?
If a spirit's present, will you give us a sign?
Like, literally, anything.
- Literally...
- Yeah, no, there's...
OK. What do you want?
- Brad. Brad.
- I'm not moving it.
It's not me.
"P"...
..."U"...
- Ali, are you doing this?
- No, I'm fucking not.
..."S"...
..."S"...
- What the fuck?
- Wait, it's still going.
It goes to the "Y."
Oh, it spells "pussy."
I mean, what, what...
Hey, hey, hey.
Pussy?!
Maybe the spirit... spirits want some pussy.
Spirits?
Yes, the spirits might be horny at the moment.
- You never know. I know I am.
- Pussy.
You know what?
We should keep going.
- Wait, do you feel that?
- Yes, 'cause you're moving it.
No, I'm not moving it.
No, this time
I'm really not moving it.
- It's...
- Wait. "H"...
Pussy-ehh.
No, Ali, I'm really, I'm really not moving it this time.
I promise you.
No, what the fuck?
Are you doing this?
No.
"N"...
- ..."T"...
- "Pussy Hunt."
It's like the worst game of Ouija ever.
Did you spell that? Are you trying to tell me something?
Yeah, yeah,
I spelled "pussy hunt."
Would you like me to go on a pussy hunt?
I can do that for you right now.

Oh, shit.
Shit.
Hi.
Ali?
Oh.
Oh, there you go, that's better, right?
Ali?
Is Ali upstairs?
- No, she isn't up here.
- She's not upstairs?
Ali? Ali!
Dad? Dad? Kristi?
- Where have you been?!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry. I got locked out.
Why would you even answer the door to somebody just knocking?
- Just open the door?
- No, I thought...
Did you look outside to see who it was?
Yes! Yes, I couldn't.
But that's the thing, see.
I couldn't see anybody, and I thought that Brad was out there.
But if you don't see anybody, then you don't go outside!
Your little brother was upstairs by himself.
- I know. I was freaking out.
- Right?
I know. I didn't,
I've never, I swear to God,
I never would have done that.
I don't understand.
What happened?
It wasn't an accident because something slammed the door behind me.
- We were worried sick about...
- What do you mean? Wait...
I took a nap, and I heard somebody calling my name.
- What?
- I felt something, like somebody was calling my name, and I felt somebody there.
Are you sure you weren't just dreaming?
You weren't there.
You didn't feel it.
- The wind blew the door closed.
- There wasn't any wind.
All right? I don't want to hear any more of this haunted house crap!
OK? That's enough. You guys are driving me crazy.
End of story.
It was like you said, with the pots falling.
- You know what?
- I was taking a nap,
- and something was calling my name.
- Sweetheart...
I'm just gonna go calm him down, OK?
Just go upstairs and try to go to bed, OK?
OK, buddy.
There you go. No, no, no.
You're eating breakfast now.
You want it on here instead?
OK.
Morning.
Good morning.
Nice.
Bye, little buddy. Hot, hot, hot.
OK, Hunter. Got to eat.
Got to eat. Come on, buddy.
I'm having these really fucked up nightmares...
...which is not something that's really new, but I'm having different ones.
There was one in particular.
Well, there were...
I've had a couple dreams where my teeth are falling out, which is really weird.
And there's one in particular, where this guy is standing at the foot of my bed...
...watching me sleep, and it's not like a scary robber dream.
I can't see his face or anything, but he was like...
...about, like, a foot back...
...from the bed there. So...
That's what's been up.
I don't get it.
How can you not want a back rub?
Because I'm concentrating.
- But you know you love it.
- Stop.
But this site says that if it's, like, really persistent, which it is, obviously, at this point, that it's probably not a ghost.
It's probably something else.
And it's possibly a demon.
Well, what's the difference between a demon and a ghost?
Because ghosts are dead people, so they're, like, human energy.
And demons are not human.
They're just...
...like, evil.
Psyching yourself out, looking online there.
I'm not psyching myself out.
Remember when I told you that my mom thought she had that, like, that flesh-eating disease?
She freaked herself out.
It's kinda like that, you know?
- Oh, my God. Babe, here.
- Let me see it.
Like fourth paragraph down.
"It has been said that if a human makes a bargain with a demon for wealth, power, or any other benefit, they must forfeit their firstborn male.
If the debt is not honored, the demon will follow the..."
Why are you smiling?
It's not funny.
"...will follow the defaulter and his or her brood until its soul of an infant is collected."
So?
OK, so this is the freakiest thing ever.
It happened to me last night.
This is the door...
...closing by itself.
That's me walking outside.
Yeah. Dad!
Will you come in here, please?!
OK, please stand over here and watch this.
Jesus.
Don't look at me, look at the screen.
Yeah. The wind blows the door closed.
- Dad.
- Thank you.
Are you serious?
- It's happened to me a million times.
- There's no wind!
The wind comes from the back when the windows are open.
It's inside the house and nothing else is open!
Turn it off and stop messing with the system.
Dad, there's obviously something in the house!
Please, come on.
It's the same thing
Martine's been saying.
Come get your dinner. It's getting cold.
I think I just heard something coming from downstairs.
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuck.
Shit!
It woke me up.
Like, it sounded like the door or something.
So I kind of checked it out and Dad was snoring.
And... I caught it on here.
Do you want to see?
- Right there, you see?
- That's weird.
It's definitely weird.
It just freaks me out because it just reminds me of like...
...what Martine was saying about the house.
What did she say about the house?
She said that there were bad spirits in the house that she had to clear out. She was clearing out the bad spirits and letting in the good spirits.
But something like that...
I don't have any other explanation for.
Do you?
I don't. I...
I remember being scared all the time.
What do you mean "scared all the time," though?
- I don't know.
- No, but what do you mean?
- Like you felt, you felt scared...
- I don't remember.
I mean,
I've been... I'm scared.
So what, did she, like, lock herself out?
Well, she said the door slammed shut on its own.
- No.
- Oh, yeah.
That's pretty darn creepy.
Yeah.
Listen, this is gonna sound totally crazy, and I know that, but...
I've been having this feeling lately that, that maybe whatever happened to us when we were little...
I think it's starting again.
I don't want to talk about this, Kristi.
I don't remember anything.
I just remember being scared all the time. What...
You want to know what I remember?
I remember you crying all the time.
I remember you couldn't sleep, and you got anxiety attacks.
I remember that you stopped talking for months.
I remember weird people came to our house and our mom was upset all the time.
That's what I remember.
Whatever it was, it thrived on fear.
The more we paid attention to it, the worse it got.
You need to leave this alone.
You need to ignore it, or you're gonna end up just like Mom.
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?
Yeah, OK. I will.
Wanna go for a walk?
Abby.
Come on.
Oh, God!
God! Leave me alone!
Yo, Kris?
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Did something just happen?
...completely fine.
Everything is fine.
Look at me.
Kristi.
Honey, everything is fine.
It's obviously not. Look at...
Your Aunt Katie said that we can't talk about these things, OK?
Because if you do, it just goes... worse.
- Listen.
- What do you mean?
Everything's fine. Ali, just stop.
Everything's fine.
OK.
No, but listen to me. That other website said that some people...
...like, make deals with demons for wealth and power.
So what if, what if
Kristi's great grandmother made a deal with a demon so she could get rich?
I went through the entire,
I went through the entire family line.
And Hunter is the first male to be born on Kristi's side since, at least, the 1930s.
Don't tell me that shit isn't coincidence.
Lie down.
Good girl.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
Did you hear that?
I heard something.
What the fuck?
Oh, God, it's Abby. Abby? Abby.
- What's the matter, baby?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.
- Is she OK?
Yeah. No, no, no. Honey, grab my keys and stuff?
- Grab my shoes!
- What's going on?
I don't know. There's something wrong with Abby.
- Dad, I'm going with you!
- She's still breathing.
- What can I do? What should I do?
- Stay here with Hunter.
OK.
And I'll call you when we get there.
- OK.
- Oh, my God.
Just call me back when you get this.
Let me know if she's OK.
OK, love you.
Hey...
Is she gonna be OK?
I love you. Bye.
Oh, God, please!
Let go of me!
No, don't! Hunter! Please!
Please!
No, I don't know. They thought it was a seizure.
No, she's never had one before, ever.
- And she was making this noise.
- Ali?
Babe, I got to call you right back, OK?
Honey, I'm really sorry to do this to you.
I know this is really bad timing.
There's something wrong with Kristi, OK?
- I can't get her out of bed.
- What's wrong with her?
...guys from Portland. I've been putting them off for weeks.
- I can't blow them off.
- OK, please, listen to me.
Can I just take
Hunter to Brad's?
No, I need you to stay here.
And I'll come home when you come home.
Honey, I know this sucks.
I do, I know, OK?
I know you're freaked out and I'm really sorry.
I'll be there for like two hours, all right?
And I have to pick up Abby. OK?
Please? I'm sorry, OK?
I... call me. I'll be, like, two hours.
If anything's wrong, just call me and
I'll be right here, OK?
OK.
I just cannot miss this today.
- Thank you. OK?
- OK, bye.
All right, don't worry. Lock the door behind me, OK?
Yeah, I mean, obviously.
No, I put him down.
He's sleeping.
She's not here.
She's still at the vet's.
No, 'cause they have to run tests 'cause they don't know what it was.
Brad, it was... like fucking...
I've never heard her cry like that.
Or just tell them that you want to come over for an hour.
Please?
Please. No, I just don't want to be here alone.
Yeah, well, basically.
She's sick or something.
OK. OK, bye.
Love you, too. Bye.
Oh, my God.
OK, so, just found this on the basement door.
Um... I don't really know where it came from.
I think that that's blood, but I can't really tell.
This comes up pretty high.
I don't think she could get up there.
It kind of looks like letters, but I don't really know what it means.
What the fuck is that?
Kristi?
Kristi?
Hey, sweetpea.
What's going on?
Come here, sweetie.
Oh, yeah.
Dad?
You have to come home right now. Dad, you have to come home.
Something is really wrong with Kristi. Please!
Please, come home, please.
Please, just, please, come home.
Please. Please.
Kristi?
Kristi? Hunter's crying.
Don't touch him!
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
- Are you OK?
- No!
- Oh, my. Where is she?
- She's upstairs.
She's in Hunter's room.
You can't go up there!
- I have to see if she's OK.
- You can't go up there!
You have to look at the tape!
- I have to check on Hunter.
- She got attacked!
You have to watch the tape! Please!
Please, please, just listen to me!
Dad, we have to go right now.
Fuck. Dad? Dad, look at me.
Do you believe me now?
Come on! We can't stay here! Please!
Dad!
What are you doing?
She tried to warn me, and I wouldn't listen.
Wait, who are you talking about?
Dad, who are you talking about?
What?
Olive oil?
What?
What am I gonna do with this?
- This is gonna knock her out?
- Si.
I told you to stay here.
OK, you're kind of freaking me out right now, OK?
Can you please talk to me?
Dad, look at her leg.
Look at the bite.
What the fuck?!
No, no. No way, no way.
We can't do this to her.
It's her family.
- Please, please...
- What am I supposed to do?!
It's Kristi's fucking sister!
We can't do that to her!
We can't do this.
We cannot do this to her.
Look, there is no other way.
Yes, there is. We can transfer it to somebody else.
- No, we can't. No, we can't.
- That's what we have to do.
OK? Martine said it had to be a blood relative.
OK? That's my wife and my son!
- That is your little baby brother!
- Do we tell her?
- Do we tell her what happened?
- No, we never tell anyone.
She's not even gonna remember, OK?
Martine said she's not gonna remember, OK?
And we're not gonna talk about it, ever!
And I don't care if you agree with me or not, OK?
It's my decision!
I'm doing it!
What...?
Let's go, please.
Please, Dad.
Dad?
Dad, please, please, be careful. Please.
Kristi?
Kristi?
Dad!
Dad! I can't see anything! Dad?!
- Ali, where are you?
- I'm right here!
Where are you?!
I'm right here! I'm right here!
- Here, here, take it.
- Fuck.
Fuck! Where's the...
Where's the baby?!
I don't know!
Dad, let's get out of here! Come on!
OK, OK.
Stay right there, OK? Just stay there.
- No! No, no!
- Stay there!
Just stay behind me, OK?
Just stay right there!
OK. OK.
What's happening?!
Oh, my God.
Ali!
Oh, my God!
- They're in the basement.
- Are you OK?
- Dad?
- Just, just stay there! OK.
Dad. Dad.
- Just stay here. OK?
- OK.
Hunter!
Oh, Jesus.
I can't see anything.
What the fuck?
Jesus! Fuck!
Oh! Fuck!
Hunter!
Damn it.
I almost gotcha. Almost gotcha.
OK, I got you. Oh, God.
I got you, little buddy.
Are you OK?
OK, you stay there.
All right. Are you ready?
You're gonna like this.
I am ready,
I'm thrilled. I'm excited.
Is it a tie? Is it...?
Oh! Shocking!
So how are things... here?
Is there any more weird stuff
- going on or, you know?
- No.
- No?
- Everything's great.
Good. I must be losing my mind. I just...
I feel like there's stuff going on at our house, to the point where I actually told Micah about it, and I'm sure he thinks I'm crazy.
You should take your own advice.
We shouldn't talk about this stuff. It just drives us nuts.
- You're right.
- Sis?
Goodbye, Hunter!
- I love you, little fella!
- Bye, Auntie!
- Bye, sis. See you soon.
- All right.
What is that?
Hello, baby.
Hi.
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah, it's... I don't know what you think it is, but whatever it is, it's pretty sweet.
I think it's a giant-ass camera.
What happened to, like, the little handheld?
Easy to move around, versatile.
Are you gonna park the car or are you gonna stand there, looking at me?
This is... big and impressive, and it has a really bright light on it.
- Kiss the camera, will you?
- I'm not kissing the camera.
- Come on.
- How much did this cost you?
- What?
- How much did...
I'll kiss you, but I'm not gonna kiss the camera.

Daniel?
Is that you?
Katie?
I don't know, feels like a grave.
Their queen is here.
And we have our orders.
It's a trap.
This is what is known.
There has always been man.
And there have always been vampires.
Since the beginning, the two have been locked in conflict.
The vampire's were quicker, stronger.
But man had the sun.
It was not enough.
And so it went like this over many years.
The two races destroying not only each other ... but the world itself.
Facing extinction, mankind withdrew behind walled cities under the protection of the Church.
And then the ultimate weapon was found, the priests.
Warriors with extraordinary powers, trained by the Church in the art of vampire combat.
They alone turned the tide to man.
The remaining vampires were placed on reservations.
And fearing the power of the weapon they created ... the ruling clergy ordered the priests disbanded.
The former warriors to be integrated back into a society that no longer needed them.
And as the years passed, the few surviving priests faded into obscurity...
...like the vampire menace before them.
Residual radiation is still spotty, but the soil contamination is close to zero.
With a little luck, we can finally start planting.
I'm proud of you, Owen.
Great, stew again.
- Atoning for your sins?
- No, why?
Wearing the nicest dress, where else would you have been all day, but church?
I was in town.
I figure someone here needs a life outside this outpost.
I thought I said I didn't want you to spending so much time out there.
- I'm old enough to go where I want.
- You're 18. That's not old enough, not out here.
I know it's hard, but we all have to make sacrifices.
Sacrifices?!
You mean living out here like a prisoner?!
- Lucy?
- No friends, no fun?!
Just that someday you might be able to grow something in these godforsaken lands?
Enough!
Bow your heads and say grace.
Dear Lord, we thank you for what we are about to receive...
- Daddy?
- Shush!
- Owen?
- Tear down below!
What's going on?!
Hurry child!
Hurry!
- Mama.
- Whatever you hear... don't scream.
Oh, my god!
Get behind me!
Shannon!
God protects you, the
Church protects you.
The city protects you.
Absolution is the only way.
Absolution is the only way.
Remember, to against the Church, means to go against God.
Confession room 5 is free.
Move forward.
Initiate confessional sequence.
Please speak at the tone.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
- Yes, my son?
- I had the dream again
- about the war.
- Tell me more.
We were in the hives, like always.
Each fell, and I wasn't strong enough.
Tell me more.
I have questions, doubts.
The Devil comes in many shapes.
The best way to combat him, is through personnel sacrifice... and a long day's labor.
Yes, Father.
Now say three Hail Mary's and four Our Father's.
And remember, to go against the
Church, is to go against God.
- Don't point.
- Mom, what's on that man's face?
It's a tattoo.
Did it hurt?
- Why can't I talk to him?
- You don't talk to priests.
- Who are you?
- Name's Hicks, on the Sheriff from Augustine.
- What do you want?
- There was a vamp attack.
They took Lucy. Your brother is hurt bad.
He told me where to find you.
- And Shannon?
- No.
Lucy talked about you.
Said you were a hero during the war.
Said that when it came to killing vampires, you were the best.
I'm going after her,
I'm gonna get her back.
Just thought I should let you know in case you wanted to come along.
Figure I could use someone like you by my side.
Okay.
Thank you for meeting me in such short notice, Monsignors.
Monsignor Chamberlain has informed us of the situation.
- Your family is in our prayers.
- Thank you.
I come before you because I need my authority reinstated.
On what grounds?
- This was a vampire attack.
- Vampires?
Nonsense, we've had no reports of any escapes from the reservations.
This is obviously the work of wasteland bandits.
- Monsignor, the boy was clear.
- "The boy" was mistaken.
There is no vampire menace, the wastelands are heavens for the lawless and the immoral...
To send a priest out there after such a lot would be both ridiculous and futile.
This is best left to the local authority.
Monsignor Orelas, this man has been of great service to the Church.
If it weren't for the priest we would have been overrun by the...
We are well aware of his accomplishments, Monsignor Chamberlain.
Thank you, you may sit.
I am begging you.
- Allow me to find her.
- You must understand something priest.
The sanctity of these walls is absolute.
And the citizens from the cities have complete faith in the Church's ability to keep them safe.
- You will not shake that faith.
- How good is that faith, when it's a lie?
Questioning the authority of the clergy is absolutely forbidden.
If you take any action to leave the cities... it will be seem as an act of aggression against the Church.
You will be stripped from the order and excommunicated immediately. Do I make myself clear?
I said, do I make myself clear, father?
Yes, Monsignor.
Try to remember your vow. To go against the Church, is to go against God.
Come on now. Don't be shy.
Give us a kiss.
That's no way to treat a friend.
Please, let me go...
You're in here for your own protection.
If I let you out, you'll be torn apart, piece by piece.
My uncle's a priest, he'll come after me.
Really?
- What makes you so sure?
- He'll come after me.
He'll come after you!
Well that's something
I'm absolutely counting on.
The judgment is final. I'm sorry.
I sacrificed everything to serve them.
- And they won't listen to me.
- The war is long over.
You and the other priests did your jobs.
It's not over, not for me.
You can't break your covenant on a small ... group of savages, it would be sacrilege.
I have to.
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Move!
If you go out there right now, you risk stirring things up again.
You have to look at the bigger picture, it's for the greater good.
- Is this the world I fought for?
- No.
But it's the only world we have left.
I'm begging you, don't do anything foolish.
Remember your vow. To go against the Church, is to go against God.
Then I go against God.
God help us.
Dear Father, forgive me.
It was never my intention to offend you.
I would like to firmly resolve with the help of your grace... to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasions of sin.
But I can't.
Looting's not such a good idea mister.
Well, I'll be damned.
Vampires are a vicious lie!
I have seen a vampire bite a man clean in half.
Salvation is right here in my very hands.
Authenticated by the clergy themselves...
- Purchase this holy water and...
- Excuse me in a minute.
Keep your loved ones safe tonight...
I'm tired of you comin' around here, scaring people, selling your superstition.
The show is over, and it's time for you to go.
Give me one good reason why I should.
That's one... two...
Alright. Alright, alright!
Goddamn son of a bitch!
You all listen up!
This stuff is good for nothin'... but lining for that man's pockets for your hard earned cash!
You don't know that. You're just a kid.
We gotta do somethin' to keep us safe.
Move out of the way!
I don't blame any of you for being scared, but the vampires are gone and they're not coming back.
You have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't to common out here.
Is it true what they say about priests?
You wield the hand of God?
How is he?
He's awake.
Your clergy took away a boy... and returned an old man.
After the war was over...
Shannon figured you'd come back.
I wanted to.
Didn't seem right any more.
I couldn't save her.
I tried, but I've never had your gift.
You gave her a life
I no longer could.
I will always be grateful to you for that.
You know there ain't one day that went by, where I wished she'd forget about you.
You find Lucy, you bring her home safe.
And you promise me something brother.
Kill 'em all.
Most people out there know that the clergy thinks of us as a bunch of godless heathens.
And that's how we like it. It means that they tend to keep their noses out of our business.
So you can imagine how surprised I was when they contacted me asking if I'd seen you.
Saying that anyone going after Lucy is to be arrested immediately.
Said she's in God's hands now.
Problem is, we both now outside a week Lucy will be dead... or worse, infected.
So with all due respect to god...
You're wasting your time.
No, no! You're not cutting me out of this!
I'm the one that came and got you!
People in this town don't think you can keep them safe here.
What makes you think you'll do any good out there?
- You any good with a gun?
- Better than I am with a knife.
We leave at dawn.
What's with all the bullets anyway?
I thought priests didn't use firearms.
We don't.
They're for you.
You have been called to serve once more.
One of your own has broken his sacred vow.
His actions are a threat to the entire order.
You will find him and bring him back to me.
Dead or alive.
Then I will teach transgressed your ways and return them back to you.
Save me from blood guilt... and god who saves me and my tongue... will sing of your righteousness... in my mouth declare your prays...
- What is it?
- Vampire tracks are random... in sets of 2, 3 or 4 prints at a time, but these are two by two.
Must have been some of the familiars.
Vampires don't bring familiars in the hunt, they slow them down.
All this... this was something else.
Tracks head north.
- There's a reservation up that way.
- Well, then. That's where we start.
Mangshane Reservation.
Nothing but red-outs and rejects.
They're a fallen tribe.
Either way, we don't have much time to get in and out.
No guards.
I thought familiars were illegal.
Nobody really enforces it, as long as it's voluntary.
- Voluntary?
- Yeah, they come from the fringes.
Drifters that want to get infected.
I mean becoming a vampire so they may live among them.
These people get all sorts of strange ideas.
As long as they keep to themselves... it makes no difference to me.
You're not welcome here, Priest.
These lands are protected.
No! I got this.
I'm looking for a local girl, kidnapped about four nights ago by a vamp-pack.
- They came through this way.
- Nobody comes through Nightshade.
It's the way we like it. Nice... and quiet.
Good, we're sure we won't have any trouble.
They excrete it, use it to build the hives.
I guess now we know what happened to the guards.
No. No, no, you must not...
The Master will be angry...
Where's the girl?
I don't know what you're talking about. Please! Please!
The Master doesn't feed humans anymore.
Yeah, tell that to the guards.
- Where is she?
- Please don't, don't...
Where is she?
Shit!
Priest! Priest!
Save your bullets.
Now, we can do this the easy way or...
God. I always preferred the hard way.
- Tell me where they took the girl.
- Haven't you done enough already, priest?
- Tell me!
- Look around you. Look what you've done to them.
They once ruled this land, they were warriors, they were Gods.
- They were murderers.
- They were what nature made them to be.
- Just like you.
- You got 10 seconds to start talking.
Then 10 seconds is all I need.
You're too late, Priest.
It is their time now.
- Did you get your gun on?
- Why?
You're gonna need it.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
- I will fear no evil,
- Your words mean nothing to them, Priest.
For thou art with me.
Focus!
- Should we go after them?
- No need, they'll die at first light.
No more masters, just you and me.
Tell me where they took the girl.
- West. They took her west.
- Why?
You have no idea what's coming, Priest.
The familiar said they travel west from here.
- Solar mirror.
- A hive?
One of the largest.
But I thought all of the hives were liquidated after the war.
They were.
That's why we need to go look.
There are more than 50 creeps in this reservation.
But only 6 vampires left. The weak.
They left behind.
We find the missing one, we find Lucy.
I may not have seen the war... but I know the look a man gets when he likes killing.
It comes easy to you.
It just comes.
Easy's got nothing to do with it.
Give me your gun.
- What?
- Give me your gun.
Vampires don't move like humans.
Their body weight pulls them in concentric patterns.
You need to anticipate their trajectory to get a kill shot.
- Are you teaching me to shoot?
- I'm teaching you how to kill vampires.
There are always two points.
A and B.
Know them both, you'll kill a vampire.
A man came aboard.
Says he got something for you.
You told me to come.
I have information, but I... before I tell you, I hate to bring this up.
But there is this small little matter of compensation.
Now, you've been really good for business.
So I am more than willing to cut you a deal.
I can smell the blood running through you veins?
Smells like dinner.
Okay. Alright.
After you snatched the girl, a couple of nights later, a priest showed up.
- Priest?
- And he was with this Sheriff, real hard case. He run me out of town before I could make a single sell.
- You've done well.
- Thank you.
There's your compensation.
Put him to work.
I used to ride out a lot here when I was little.
Stared at all this stuff.
Wondered what it used to be.
After a while, it just made my eyes ache.
Did Owen know about you and Lucy?
No, no.
She wanted to tell him, but...
Owen wasn't the easiest man to talk to.
Besides, he was so focused on his work there wasn't much room for anything else.
Do you love her?
You know if she's infected...
I'll kill her.
You'll try... but you won't be able to.
I wasn't there to protect her once,
I won't make that same mistake again.
- Feels like a grave.
- It's a trap.
This is a waste of time, there's nothing here.
Stay here, if anything comes up that isn't me, shoot it.
Great.
- What are you doing here?
- The Clergy sent me. Ordered me to bring you back.
They sent four of us to track you.
We split up at Nightshade.
I rode out here and hoped they didn't have you.
The others went up to Jericho.
I didn't believe it when they told me you broke your vow.
They left me no choice.
Hicks!
What the hell is that thing?
- A hive guardian.
- Who the hell are you?!
It's too big to get down here.
Which is the only reason you're still alive.
Who the hell is that?
Are you ready?
Hey!
Not bad.
Point A, meet point fucking B.
The hive's been abandoned for years.
Why would something be protecting it?
Does the lawman know what you'll do if she's infected?
He knows.
- He'll try to stop you.
- He won't be able to.
It's been hard all these years... not seeing the others, not talking.
Sector 7 was the only place I could find work.
Waste management.
No one would hire me.
"No applicable skills."
I heard that, too.
I didn't come here to bring you back.
I came here to warn you.
There are nights when I wake up...
I think I'm back on the red mines.
I'm sweating. My muscles are clenched like, like I'm ready for something.
Nights like that,
I don't go back to sleep.
I have bad dreams.
Me, too.
There are other nights, the good nights...
I dream about other things.
- Why doesn't it look like the rest of the hive?
- This sections new. They must have rebuilt it.
My God.
They bread a new army.
Where did they all go?
Only one way to find out.
Are priests allowed to have relations?
- We take a vow of celibacy.
- So, you mean you've never...
I was a young girl when the Clergy found me.
What about him?
His talents developed later.
He was nearly you're age when the Clergy came for him.
That made his sacrifice greater than most.
The air is changing.
Well, there's your answer.
They dug right through the mountain and... made a hole big enough to fit an army through.
What town is that?
It's Jericho.
Where'd you say the others went?
What the hell?
Hello?!
Hello!
Is anybody there?
Let's begin.
I don't see anything.
Brothers, you have a choice.
You can follow in my footsteps or you can follow in his.
We're too late.
We separate. Go through each building, and see what we find.
There's nobody left. Not a soul.
Too many mouths to feed.
Killing three priests? What kind of vampire could do something like that?
Nothing we've ever seen before.
How could they take an entire town over night, and vanish by sunrise?
There are no other hives around here, no reservations.
- Where does this rail line go?
- It's an old mining line.
It starts in the Dunkirk mine above Augustine.
- Jericho's the last stop before it reaches...
- The cities.
Heading back to the cities would be suicide, right?
- The sun will kill them.
- There is no sun in the cities.
Not anymore.
Without us, they're defenseless.
- I'm responsible.
- No, this was systematic.
Whoever took Lucy knew that you'd come for her... and that we'd come for you.
They were drawing us out.
They must have been picking up different factions along the way, moving during the day and feeding at night.
- It's going to be a massacre.
- It's going to be a war.
Train carrying an army of vampires?
What chance do we have stopping something like that?
I'll overtake the train and blow the rail-line.
You two get aboard and find Lucy.
I'll start charging the bikes.
It's gonna take everything we have to stop that train before it reaches the cities.
You must be starving.
You haven't eaten in days.
Have you ever had a real roast duck?
It's very rare, very exotic.
- Of course not.
- Try it, you'll never have better.
- What do you want?
- I want the same things that you want.
I want to be free from a life of suffering and sacrifice.
To no longer be told that your every desire is a sin.
And after all, if you're not committing sin, you're no longer having fun.
What are you?
The Church teaches us that the eyes are the window to the soul... and since the vampire evolved without eyes, it is a soulless creature... to be eradicated.
And I have seen the soul of the vampire.
And let me tell you... it is far more pure than that of any man.
Now you ask me what I am?
I am the bringer of the tide...
I am the wave to wash clean this unclean world.
And you and your priest... will help me do it.
He's gonna kill her, isn't he?
If she's infected?
She talked about him.
Said she never got to known him.
She wanted to.
What kind of man would kill his own flesh and blood?
If she becomes a familiar, she's no ones flesh and blood.
Not anymore.
I've held on to it all these years... to remind me of everything they've stripped away from us.
Our honor, our abilities, our faith...
Today when we ride,
I want you to remember our power doesn't come from the Church... it comes from God.
With or without the Clergy, we're still priests.
I can't.
When I heard what happened to Shannon...
I prayed for her salvation.
And then I prayed for mine.
Because in the darkness of my heart...
I hoped her death would free you at last.
- Tell me you won't kill her.
- Hicks, don't do this.
Tell me, or I will shoot you where you stand.
It would be easier to face you bullet here than face what may lie up ahead.
Why do you even care?
She is nothing but a stranger to you.
She's his daughter.
- She was just a baby when the Clergy took me.
- You're lying. I knew Owen.
The child needed a father.
We all made sacrifices.
Hicks.
If you do this, it won't matter if you find Lucy.
It won't stop the train, and you won't be able to save her.
You won't save her.
We ride out and meet this together.
When the time comes, you blow the tracks and then you get out of there!
What if you're still on the train?
Good-luck.
Focus!
Holy shit.
Hello, my friend.
- You fell!
- You let go!
In the depths of that hive, I crossed the threshold between life and death.
And do you know what I found?
The queen we had come to kill, my angel of mercy.
She turned me into something that had never existed in this world.
A human vampire.
Join me.
Accept the blood of the queen.
And together we can return to the cities... as brothers.
- Where's my daughter?
- Waiting for your decision.
You can't win.
I'm stronger now than you ever were.
This is your last chance, Priest.
The queens hands have not been idle.
Mankind will find no quarter from what's coming.
Join me, and your life of sacrifice will be over.
Never.
Hicks!
Lucy!
- Fuck.
- Did you find her?
I couldn't get close.
They took her to the front.
- You would have made a good priest.
- Thanks.
Don't let it go to your head.
- Hicks!
- Lucy!
No!
Stop it!
No, Lucy!
Very good!
Fast.
Just like your father.
He never told you?
Oh, god!
Burn.
At this time of need, strengthen me.
You are my refuge and strength...
I do not fear, for you are with me.
I won't let you go!
Your faith has failed you!
No!
For the life of the flesh is in the blood.
And I have given it to you upon the altar... to make atonement for your souls.
How dare you come back to this holy place?
A man who would defy the Church, for his own selfish crusade!
Look inside the burning train just behind these cities walls... you'll find hundreds more like it.
- And their queen was not among them.
- Lies!
This man is a charlatan.
A risk to the security of the cities.
There is no vampire menace!
- The war is over, Priest!
- No.
It's just beginning.
I've notified the others. We'll meet you at the rendezvous at City 7.
Godspeed!

In a village in the heart of England, we're tracing the tale of one community through the whole of our history.
We've got something which is possibly prehistoric!
Yeah? Oh, we've lost it.
Oh...! No, don't say that!
The village is Kibworth in Leicestershire.
When we get into the post-Norman period, look how it changes.
Huge explosion of growth...
With science, history and archaeology, we're seeing how the story of the village is also the story of the nation.
This area of South Leicestershire is very radicalised politically.
"You're fighting for England", he says.
They were killed in the Abbey.
The high altar itself was splashed with blood.
To help us, we've got wonderful village archives.
This is what you've really come to see.
From the 13th century, we can tell the stories of individual peasant families over the generations.
Suddenly, with this, this village and its people come to life.
In the documents, everyday tales of medieval lives.
Emma Gilbert, villein.
Robert, the doctor.
Alice Star... Matilda Star...
BOTH: Sisters.
So how will the villagers cope with the horrors that lie ahead in the 14th century - the most catastrophic in our history?
That's the next chapter of the story.
In the next stage of our search,
I've come to ask the help of the children at Kibworth High School.
Imagine that... is the A6.
Yeah?
Now, the A6 is an ancient road, but it takes a modern little turn through Kibworth Harcourt, and the original village street goes something like this. Yeah?
'I'm asking the children to dig archaeological test pits
'to find out more about the village in the early 14th century.'
We're going to put our pits in the memorial garden, and... along there.
We've already dug 55 pits across the village, but we need to know more.
First of all we're going to take out all the plants and that...
So now we've targeted the area behind the medieval marketplace, and in the gardens behind two of the old farmhouses.
Like England as a whole, the village had a boom time up to 1300.
Hooray!
In 1300, Kibworth parish consisted of the hamlet of Smeeton Westerby, and the two main manors of Kibworth
Beauchamp and Kibworth Harcourt.
Maybe 1,000 people in all - free men and women, serfs, and villeins.
But the length of them is very impressive.
There's quite a lot of land in that back area there, which is obviously agricultural.
And maybe one housing plot here, possibly?
Mm. Or two?
What do you make of the house... any instant impressions there?
The way you analyse a building like this is to count the bays - the distance between the upright timbers.
So you've got one, two, three, four bays.
And each bay is roughly 15 feet long.
So by sort of 1600, it's a jolly nice farmer's house.
But back in 1300... maybe more than one family of villeins.
What would a villein have had on this plot?
Well, villeins are not very privileged people - they're unfree... so they have to go to the lord's court, and it's the lord's court which rules over their lives.
And in Kibworth Harcourt, they had
12 acres of land each, a holding of
12 acres of land. Beyond the village boundary, in the open field.
Both the Kibworths and Smeeton were open-field villages.
Each of the great fields was divided into many small strips, which were shared out and farmed communally by the peasants and their families.
To keep the fields fertile, the peasants carted out all the manure from their barns and yards, with whatever debris was mixed up in it.
So today we're searching for medieval rubbish.
Most of it gets here, because they have a midden, they have a muck heap in the yard behind the house.
They put every bit of rubbish onto it, and they'd all get shuffled onto a cart called a tumbril.
And then in the field you pull a lever and the stuff gets dumped onto the field, and along with half a tonne of manure you're spreading pieces of broken pottery.
Which we go to so much trouble picking it up again.
It was back-breaking work, but it was the way of life for our ancestors - men and women - for 800 years.
When you plot this stuff, you can see the scatters of Stamford Ware from the late Saxon period when these field systems are first laid out.
You can see the early medieval, the late medieval, and quite often the early post-med, the late post-med, depending on when it's enclosed.
What would you have seen, standing here in 1300?
100% cultivation, really.
A very boring landscape, really, because, you know, it's all brown in the autumn, it's all yellow in the summer...
It's very, very heavily cultivated.
How does Nicholas Pooley know that his strip is different from Walter Peaks', and...?
Well, at the end of the strip... imagining this hedge, which of course wasn't there then, there's a headland at the end of the strip... you would have some sort of marker, and it could be a wooden post, it could be a stone.
Later on the stone might even have an initial on it, you know...
P for Pooley or whatever.
I've recently discovered that in Yorkshire they had holes.
They were so mean in Yorkshire that they didn't have a post or a stone, they just dug a little hole.
And THAT marked the boundary.
And this way of life, hand-ploughing with animals, continued all over England well into the 20th century.
The open-field system was not only labour intensive... it took a huge amount of mental effort to memorise all the intimate detail of the fields and strips.
Most of that knowledge is lost now - but not at Kibworth.
Because back in 1300, the farmers of
Kibworth Harcourt gave every detail of their land and lives to the new landlords - Merton College, Oxford.
The field itself is East Field, it gives us in English Easte Feilde.
This is strip by strip, with the furlongs being named!
And the local jury writing this down as they see it.
I've got the later names of the field strips here in the East Field.
The Long Coombs furlong, Blackland furlong, Stonehill furlong...
Yes, and we have Stonehill here,
"Stonehull"...
Two strips. Two strips on Stonehill.
And of course, perfect name... it would remind you, it's the stony bit of land up the top of the field.
Long Hoe and Short Hoe, and Hearn Seek furlong.
Berridge Home furlong.
Sladewall...?
Sladewall.
Names and customs... the pattern of the landscape in the minds of the people, handed down for 1,000 years.
Broad Wan...
Down here, five strips.
That is just so fantastic.
Now, these strips of parchment have "Ex parte umbra" and "Ex parte solis"...
"On the shady side" and "on the sunny side".
That's the way the jury remember the strips.
Yeah.
By memorising the fields as the sun goes round like that...
So it is orientation.
So it's orientation.
Horse Hill.
That top part appears to be...
Research being done on camera, you see, this is the real thing!
Nobody's faking this.
In an agricultural community like medieval Kibworth, the most important man was the ploughman, and the most important animals were the oxen.
They bred them, cared for them, lived with them.
Walk on...
And in Weald and Downland
Open Air Museum, they're doing a fascinating piece of experimental archaeology... training young oxen ready to take the plough.
For the small, poor family, you couldn't have what you'd term as an oxen, a castrated male, standing round all year doing nothing.
So they worked the cows, the females.
You can have a calf, and you can milk it.
So it's a multi-purpose animal.
And if you only had one cow, your neighbour had a cow, you'd put the two together.
If another neighbour had a pony, then you could put the pony on the front, and have a three-team.
So they used everything they could.
Come on...
So do they know when they're being talked to, the individual...
They do. Yes.
Each pair has the same letter.
So these two are Rose and Ruby, and the ones behind us are Gwen and Graceful.
It's a single-syllable name near side, this side, and double-syllable off side.
I mean, the most we know recorded put together was 86.
86?! 86, yeah. And that was to move a windmill.
They moved a windmill from the centre of Brighton - I think it was Regency Square - and they moved it up onto the South Downs.
In the Middle Ages, the ploughmen are quite charismatic figures... famous ploughmen in their patchwork coats... and the fictional Piers Ploughman becomes a kind of English everyman, subject of a tide of popular song and social protest poetry through the 14th century, because - as the ballad-makers said...
"on his shoulders rested the mirth of all the land".
And "Godspeed well the plough" was not just a proverb, it was a heartfelt prayer.
I'll let you get on with it.
Thank you.
Rose! Come on, walk on.
Rose...
Rose, come on.
Now, if you were a freeman or woman, you ploughed your own fields, paid rent and sold your surplus after tax.
But if you were an unfree peasant - a villein, a cottar or a serf... you also owed your lord service, and that could be a real burden.
Whoa...
Survey of the Manor of Kibworth, its dues and services and customs.
So this is Merton recording the community pretty soon after they've got hold of it?
That's right. Obviously the college wants to know what its dues are, and to some extent what its liabilities are to the tenants.
"And here the dues..."
This is what peasants owed here.
And not just in money, but in services.
Two days ploughing each year without food, bringing your own plough!
Gathering straw together for roofing the buildings of the manor court, whenever needed.
Carrying the lord's corn to Leicester market on your own horse, but no further.
Unless it be within the county.
Carrying coal within the county - using your own cart!
Two days mowing the lord's meadow, with one man.
Two days harrowing and hoeing.
With food provided.
Reaping, four days.
The men of the village to mow the lord's meadow, with a gift of one shilling and sixpence in beer!
And on 1300 prices, that was enough to get you very drunk!
So from the 1270s, the Merton archive gives us the most incredible detail on Kibworth Harcourt.
We can trace everybody in the village from then until now, virtually, and do family trees of peasants for 15 generations.
But what about Kibworth Beauchamp and Smeeton Westerby?
Well, the missing gap is here in A Parish And County History
Of Leicestershire
Of The Antiquarian William Burton.
It's one of the earliest of the county histories and it contains our first historical accounts of the Kibworths and Smeeton.
Published in 1622, the same year, the same publisher and the same printer as Shakespeare's folio.
Of course, it's obsessed, as you'd expect, with manorial history, but what's really interesting about this is that Burton's notes survive and they're an altogether different matter.
Here they are.
They were written down in 1615,
"copied from the ancient original membranes by me, W Burton,
"15th July, 1615".
He excerpted the great rolls of the survey of 1279, the most detailed survey of England ever done before modern times.
They're lost now, but here, largely unpublished in his notebooks, are the first detailed accounts not only of Kibworth Harcourt, but Kibworth Beauchamp and Smeeton Westerby.
Starting with Smeeton, here, for the first time, are the names of families in the village, and some of them very long-lasting families in the village story.
The Aliens and the Astins - very long-lasting names in that part of Leicestershire and indeed in Kibworth.
When you turn to Beauchamp, though, nearly everybody unfree.
There's about 45 families of villeins and serfs.
1315, and it had two mills, one water and one wind.
Oh, did it?! Yes, how about that?!
But attached to it, 200 acres of land. So that must have been...
Yes, that piece down there, straight down.
All the way across to... To Smeeton.
Yes, it's always called the old house in the middle of the village.
And you had... You had, I'm sorry.
You had a communal bread oven out in the village street.
So, again, the villagers brought their corn to make bread.
A little cut of that went to the manor house.
Four free tenants, 24 villeins, each one with a cottage and 15 acres, and 80 serfs, who were the lowest level, kind of peasantry. Well.
So the Beauchamp half of Kibworth was still unfree, as it had been back in 1066.
That's how things stood in Kibworth at the height of the feudal system.
The population of the parish at well over 1,000 now as high as it would get until Victorian times.
This is contents two, yeah?
Yes, and this is the... Out of our...
Out of our pit.
On Main Street, the kids have not yet got down to the level of the medieval marketplace.
There are long bones and the ribs.
And, yeah... different things.
But for the field walkers, there were easy pickings from the once teeming medieval fields.
There's certainly stuff from the 13th, 14th century.
And in Cambridge, Carenza Lewis is collating the evidence from our earlier test pits, showing the growth of the village up to the boom time before 1300.
Here, the villages we can see today, seem to be taking off.
This is the point where we can see the villages we know today starting to have their direct origins.
Smeeton Westerby, again, the longest occupied village is clearly continuing to prosper.
The other significant place we've got is up here in Kibworth Harcourt.
You can see the village growing.
That is Kibworth Harcourt extending along the street there and pottery coming out of virtually every test pit.
Yes, and not much in Kibworth Beauchamp.
You know, there's an old village legend that, kind of, Harcourt is the posh, rather well to do end and Beauchamp is always the poor end.
But you wouldn't ever find that hinted at in the pottery, would you?
Well, that's what's so fascinating about this period.
You've got these two strands of evidence that we can use to sort of reflect off each other.
It is interesting, isn't it, that in the light of that knowledge, you can look at this map and think there's very much less here?
It's funny, isn't it, how history can leave its mark?
In Victorian times, the villagers even argued about separate sewage systems.
Harcourt and Beauchamp had different doors in the church and even separate parts of the graveyard.
This is the surviving windmill at Kibworth Harcourt.
They had two here and two over in Kibworth Beauchamp.
It's a post mill.
You turned it on its central post using this wooden tail to face the wind.
This was new technology that had spread over
England in the 13th century to feed the booming population.
There's more than 1,500 people.
But here in Kibworth, as across
England, the boom time was over.
There were too many mouths to feed, not enough jobs, too many poor people desperately struggling to survive on marginal land.
And around 1300, you get the first signs of recession... price rises, social unrest and even disturbing patterns in the weather.
But even in their worst imaginings, they couldn't have foreseen what lay ahead.
From the 1290s, the English summer went wrong.
And in a credulous age, omens and prophecies started to stack up.
It is foretold that great misfortunes lie ahead.
Earthquakes and wars, division of realms and peoples and a great and unheard of famine.
As climate change set in, the village braced itself.
The key person at village level was the reeve.
The reeve's job was to supervise the agricultural year in the village... the ploughing, the reaping and the sowing.
He chaired the village court, adjudicated on disputes and he submitted the accounts to the landlords, the Fellows of Merton College.
And the reeve in 1314 was a man called John Poli.
He was married with four kids,
Agnes, Hugh, Will and Rob.
He wasn't a rich man.
His father only held 7.5 acres, but he was a freeman, not a villein.
And it's in John's accounts that the first signs can be seen of the coming catastrophe.
In the Kibworth court rolls and in many others across England, we can watch as disaster strikes.
1314, January. There was severe cold.
One frost lasted more than two weeks.
Extra milk was needed for the lambs and oats for the horses.
Spring. April very cold.
A high mortality of doves.
Summer was cold with continual rain.
The roses were late this year.
Autumn, very wet followed by a sharp frost.
Ploughing was late. More oats were needed for the horses.
Winter. Snow cover for much of the time.
We fed the peas to the pigs.
A late winter this year.
It was wet and cold into the spring.
Extra hoeing.
The peas were flooded.
Summer was very wet.
Very low yields for barley and wheat.
Autumn, very wet.
Ploughing prolonged. Sheep rot.
Late spring.
Weather was wet.
More sheep rot.
Summer was exceptionally dry.
Ground rock-hard.
We had to purchase
12 measures of steel and 40 pieces of iron for the repair of ploughs.
Much more this year because of the dryness of the summer and the hardness of the fallow.
By 1315, the people found themselves in the worst famine in British and European history.
The harvest of 1315 was a disaster.
Poor tenants were forced to give up their holdings and sell off their gear.
People were dying everywhere.
Grain yields slumped and prices shot up.
While rich merchants bought up the surplus to make a profit, the peasants were thrown back on their knowledge of the countryside.
Your main meal would have been your pottage, your porray, whatever happened to be in season, even edible weeds.
Things like fat hen and borage and bitter cress.
We know about the medieval cottage garden from a minute excavation done of one peasant house - the kind lived in by Matilda and Alice Star.
Plot of vegetables and herbs would go right up to your cottage front?
Absolutely. You would cultivate as much as you possibly could, really.
Starvation was always a possibility and you would grow whatever you possibly could.
This is where your edible weeds came in - mallows, hyssop, mugwort, the artemisia vulgaris, the wild wormwood.
If your crops failed, at least you'd have something to put in the pottage.
If you were good at doing this, you could just about keep things together.
You may well be able to keep going.
You learn what's around in your local area.
So you know what's growing in your hedgerows and you know from past experience what's good to pick and what isn't.
You've got beer in there and, of course, you get lots of calories from that.
You've got all these greens, herbs from the hedgerows.
You've got things like Alexanders and fivers, flat-leaf parsley.
And, depending what year we're in, we'll get changes of those as well.
So they really knew how to exploit what was around them?
I think so. Yes.
It's very much a community effort, as well.
It's not just the family. It's everybody living in that rural area, you know, with the field strips, farming those strips, their animals.
People are living with their animals cos they're that precious.
You've got to make sure they're going to get through the winter.
The next year, 1316, things only got worse.
Across England, hundreds of thousands were now dying.
Northern Europe froze under a blanket of snow and ice.
What they didn't know was that they were in the middle of a little ice age.
And then came a new and disturbing development... the first signs of a virulent pestilence among animals, recorded by the Leicester chronicler, Henry Knighton.
In 1318 and 1319, there was an horrific mortality of humans and a pestilence of animals throughout the kingdom of England.
Conditions were so bad that the surviving people didn't have the wherewithal to cultivate or sow their lands.
Every day, they were burying as many as they could in improvised cemeteries everywhere.
And so a great ruin seized the English people.
There's a tiny detail from that time at the manor house in Kibworth Beauchamp, where the absentee landlord had let things fall to rack and ruin.
The jury say that the manor house itself is a total ruin and has been divided up into cottages worth five shillings a year, it says - they note it all these things in the Middle Ages - and let out to farm.
So it's a little, kind of, snapshot of that terrible winter coming on when they lost all their harvest with the rain in that autumn.
We nearly had a winter like that up here now.
It's been a horrible winter with a terrible lot of rain.
You imagine what that must have been like in a community where everybody in the village devoted their labour to making food.
Absolutely.
Grain prices in Leicester market during the famine had now shot up seven times to 44 shillings a quarter when you needed eight quarters to sow an acre.
As the famine got worse, the Merton court books are full of little details.
In the winter of 1314-15,
Nick Sybil died and the college took over the administration of his strips as his son was under-age.
Then, in 1315-16, the court book says,
"John Sybil, aged 14, inherited his father's lands
"and he sowed them with seven pence worth of oats,
"18 pence worth of wheat and four shillings worth of peas."
He was the breadwinner now.
So, with a widowed mother and younger siblings, young John was in trouble.
Harvest 1316 was another disaster, and to make things worse, there were signs of sickness in his most precious possession... his plough oxen.
Almost four million animals have been killed since...
Like the modern foot-and-mouth epidemic in Britain, the virus raged out of control, only this more virulent and more agonising.
There was also an unheard-of mortality among the cattle, the oxen, the cows and the calves.
It continued unabated for several years and everywhere the poor cattle seemed to be crying out to the people, looking at them and roaring as if they were in tears because of the terrible pain that gnawed at their insides.
And then suddenly they would fall down and die.
The news of such terrible suffering in the countryside caused great consternation here in Merton.
They saw immediately that it would be impossible to push the receipt of rents as it had been before the famine.
The Great Famine was remembered with bitterness.
The merchants still had profited.
The supplies had been there, which, had a supine government been motivated to move them with more alacrity, could perhaps have staved off disaster.
As the popular songs of the time said, there was one law for the rich and one for the poor, "For might is right and the land is lawless".
More than half a million people in
England died in the Great Famine,
10% of the population.
But peasant societies like medieval Kibworth are resilient.
For centuries, they'd lived with famine and disease.
And in the 1320s, they began to recover.
So much so that in 1327, the king raised a poll tax on all freeholders.
And in the National Archive, the returns survive for Kibworth.
But what do they call it in 1327, David?
Just K-Y-B-B-E-W-O-R-T-H,
Kybberworth.
This is for the 20th of 1327, so it's a twentieth of the value of everybody's chattels, which is basically your corn and your animals.
You had to have corn and animals worth ten shillings, which is in modern terms half a pound.
The minimum you would pay for the tax if you had ten shillings would be sixpence.
So that's six of these.
Let's have a look. Here is - wait for it - medieval money.
Oh, great. And these are all silver pennies from the mid-13th century.
This is the only currency.
So everything had to be paid in silver pennies.
Anything which is just pence -
18p, 14p, 12p... you're a peasant.
Whereas the top person, William Swan, has got four and six, that's 54 pennies, as against 12 pennies here.
He would be a major sort of freeholder.
So there are big class divisions and wealth divisions within Kibworth? Yeah.
Clearly here, even within what is a peasant society, there are big class divisions.
The really poor people aren't there.
So we don't know what the size of Kibworth was.
If you had a whole list of the names of the villagers, it might go on for ages with people below the line needed for taxation.
During this time, Leicester, nearby, began to draw many Kibworth people as craftsmen, drapers, ironmongers, joining guilds and bettering themselves.
Leicester was growing.
And of course, it was growing because people were coming in because they could make a better living.
This is actually a tax roll of people who were identified by their trade or where they come from.
You've got William of Kibworth,
Geoffrey of Osbiston or William of Lutterworth.
There are local places but also people from further afield.
There's someone from Carlisle,
I noticed earlier.
But they're not all men either.
There is Alissia de Kiborth here.
These are people who are living in Leicester? Yes.
Who were taxed in Leicester. Yes.
Could even be guild members in Leicester, perhaps. Yes.
But keeping their village name but working in trades here.
I suppose that's how they know.
"I'm talking about William".
"Which William?"
"Well, the William from Kibworth, that William".
There's only a limited number of Christian names, so you're beginning to see surnames coming in.
But cities can be dangerous places, especially for inexperienced country boys.
From the time of the famine, there's a cautionary tale involving a man from Kibworth.
"Contensio motar erat."
Yeah, punch-up. A punch-up.
This is a fight between Ivo, cleric of Great Stretton, and Henry Pollings, who's described as,
"Groom of Alice of Stretton".
But she's Alice of Stretton of Leicester.
She's one of those newcomers who come to the city but keep the name of their village as well. That's right.
So, a dispute broke out between
Ivo the clerk...
So, he's a lettered person, this guy.
And Henry Pollings,
Alice Streatham's groom, in a place called Parchmen Lane.
Parchmen Lane.
Yes. It was a little sort of lane that ran just inside the town walls.
In November of around the hour of Vespers, sort of 4, 6 o'clock, evening, anyway, it would be dusk.
25th November, darkness coming on?
Yes. Narrow lane.
Yes, just the place to have your...
Rumpus, isn't it, really?
I don't know what they were doing.
Now enters the Good Samaritan,
Philip the Young of Kibworth, son of one of Merton's free tenants.
And he's about to pay a heavy price for being a have-a-go hero.
It's almost like a citizen's arrest, isn't it? Yeah.
Gets hold of this chap and takes him towards the house of the aforesaid Alice.
Then, "Venit quia Johannes filius
Alani"... the mustard maker.
John, the son of Alan, the mustard maker.
The notorious mustard maker.
Yes. That's right. Great.
Out he comes.
All roads lead to Alice's house.
With a certain bow and shot the aforesaid Philip with a certain small arrow in the head between the eye and the nose, right up to the brain.
Very unpleasant, yes. Philip lived until the following Monday and then he died.
The coroner's language is almost like today, isn't it?
"The aforesaid John did the aforesaid in a westerly direction."
"A sword worth five shillings."
That's right. That's it. Before the bailiff, the inquiry was held.
Which said that no-one was suspected, except the aforesaid John, who had fled the scene after the deed. That's right.
And got away, presumably.
And John, the son of Alan the mustard maker, sounds a slightly nefarious character, do you think, Robin?
Well... He's a wanted man now.
He's a fugitive, an outlaw.
As for Philip's family, they must have wished he'd stayed on the family strips in the East Field, or that he'd come home early for Christmas.
Now, in the 14th century,
Christmas was the great holiday.
You got three weeks off from work in the fields from mid-December, to Plough Monday, after Twelfth Night.
That was the time when the ploughman and their boys carried the ploughshare around the houses of the village, with songs and dancing and received cakes and ale.
It's a tradition that survived till the 1930s in Kibworth.
It was a festive time for medieval villagers, when work was put aside and neighbours got together.
But at Christmas 1348, terrible rumours came down the road from London.
Nearby in Leicester,
Henry Knighton tells the tale.
"It started in India
"and then it moved across the face of the Earth,
"from Tartary, through the land of the Saracens,
"and into the lands of the Christians,
"a universal plague upon mankind.
"And on 25th June 1348, it landed at Weymouth."
Rats came from the ships... and they came from Weymouth, and spread their way north.
What caused it in particular?
What was it about the rats? Andrew.
The fleas on the rats had like a disease that was contagious.
That's very good. How did it begin?
Boils on your arm.
Boils. That's very good.
It's the bubonic plague that we're particularly looking at, and the pneumonic plague, as well.
Ever since, the Black Death has seized the European imagination.
The ultimate symbol of the powerlessness of humanity in the face of King Death.
In the winter of 1348, the plague reached London.
Just outside London Wall, close to the Barbican, tradition says that a huge death pit was opened here, under Charterhouse Square.
Under the grass are said to be 10,000 burials.
Recently, in London, the first Black Death cemetery to be scientifically excavated, has revealed close-up detail from 1348.
The gravediggers, too scared to take coins from the purses of the dead.
In Kibworth, they knew it was coming.
A two-pronged attack up the Bristol Channel and through the rivers of East Anglia, like malevolent monsters.
And at the point of their jaws,
Kibworth.
That Christmas, young Robert Church had gone down to Oxford to apply in person to the Fellows of
Merton for a holding in the village.
Perhaps he brought the plague back.
The first known death in the parish was in Kibworth Beecham early that spring.
Then, in the Merton court rolls, the full horror begins to unfold.
Right. It should be a fairly...
Striking...
Written on both sides as well.
So, the college, even in the catastrophe of the Black Death, they tried to keep the administration going.
The rhythm of life just continues and it's a way of coping, I suppose.
It's an incredibly human response in catastrophe, isn't it, to keep things ordered, I suppose.
Right, I think it...
Yes, we have it.
Post conquestum and 23.
23rd year of the reign of King Edward.
Edward III.
So, 1349.
Yes. The year of the Black Death.
And we know what time of year this was, do we?
It should even give us a day.
14th May. Cor!
These are the swearing in of new officers, a beadle... the new reeve.
Yes, names that we recognise. Polle.
William Polle.
John Haine. Yeah.
Administration was so immediate, it wasn't a bureaucracy that was delegated to a local authority as we have today.
You were the local authority.
If you weren't elected this year, you could be next year to be the constable or the, you know, looking after the pound, or whatever.
Meeting of the village court,
Kibworth Harcourt,
St George's Day, 1349.
John Church, reeve.
The following tenants died of the pestilence. Emma Cook,
Alice Arron,
John Church Senior,
Agnes Poli, Robert Poli,
Mr Haines, Mr Goodwin,
John and Constance Cybil.
Margaret Meister,
Richard Sylvester,
Nick Clarke,
Henry Harcourt and Matilda Harcourt.
Will Smith.
Alice Carter, Adam Kibworth,
Thomas Harcourt,
Rob Meister, Nick Poli,
Emma Wade, Agnes Allit.
John Hain, Will Milner.
And 1349 wasn't the end of it.
King Death came again to the village in 1361.
In 1375, 78, 89, and 95.
And a last cruel spasm in 1412.
The Poli family alone had seven male members dead.
The equivalent is the First World War, with a whole generation signing up and going off together and not coming back.
What have we got here?
The black ink is replacements?
Yes. And the browner writing has been crossed out and almost carated in is the new tenant.
Gosh, is that... is that a Poli up there as well?
Can you see?
In his notes, the reeve keeps up the impression of normality.
One of the customary tenants is one of the women.
Yes, this is Isabella Poli.
She's died. You'll see her name has been crossed through.
And somebody completely different, in fact,
I think it's Robert Smith.
It's not a member of her family, unless by marriage, but it's a completely, you know, it's an alien.
It's not passed from mother to son.
And the family couldn't take it over presumably because of their losses.
Possibly weren't enough sons to take over.
You dug out this sort of space here, about this area, isn't it?
You can still see bones coming through there.
There's lots of tiny, tiny little bones.
And I found a few tiny bits of pottery popping up as well.
Across Kibworth, many properties were abandoned at this time.
But the evidence around the medieval marketplace for what happened after the Black Death was thin to say the least.
I think it's plastic.
It's a bit disappointing, in terms of medieval activity.
But having this sort of negative evidence for the medieval period is good as well.
When you take this forward to the next period...
Wow.
Smeaton, which has been with us for so long seems to be absolutely devastated by it.
There's just two or three sites that have produced single sherds of pottery.
That is so amazing.
In one area that carries on in occupation seems to be up here.
Even if these other areas are occupied, what it's really showing is this huge dislocation where these pits were producing pottery for the high medieval period, those are not being occupied nearly as intensively.
The people who lived there are somewhere else.
And you're talking,
I suppose, about a population that's gone from maybe
2 million in 1086, to something like 6, possibly, in 1300.
There's a lot of argument about this, isn't there? But...
Perhaps collapses back down to two or three.
Massive contraction.
After the ravages of the plague, many English villages were deserted forever.
But not here.
Even Smeaton survived with the old families we met in the 1270s.
The Allans. The Swans.
But in Harcourt, the Merton court rolls show the loss of two thirds of the tenants.
The highest losses from the Black
Death known anywhere in Britain.
And a hint of the villagers reactions to the catastrophe comes in a box of documents which has recently turned up, recording grants made of property and land in the 1350s that later came into the hands of the village grammar school.
They still provide a charitable income for Kibworth high school.
So, an astonishing treasure trove, the school box.
These are the earliest documents from the 1350s, the immediate aftermath of the Black Death.
It's very rare that you can home-in on what the ordinary people, the peasant farmers, are thinking at this time.
But it's revealed here.
This is a little land document, like a mortgage.
HE READS IN LATIN
Know people now and people in the future that I, John Deer...
HE READS LATIN this grant of land confirmed with
Robert Chapman of Kibworth.
And it's the gift of one house...
HE READS LATIN which belonged to Nick Poli in Church Lane.
Poli died in the Black Death.
Recently dead.
Along with a rood - that's a quarter of an acre in middle furlong... and a rood of meadow.
What these men are doing is they're putting together a little parcel of property and land whose revenues, supervised by a group of local trustees, farmers, will give enough money to fund a chantry priest, separate from the parish church.
Now, this priest may in time have even taught the kids in the village to read and write but his chief job is to do masses, dirges and requiems forever for the souls of the dead.
For the mothers and fathers, the brothers and sisters, and the children of the village who died in the Black Death.
The greatest catastrophe in its history.
That document from 1353 is the start of a whole series of gifts for commemoration and charity.
In Kibworth, it's a continuous thread from the bequests of Tudor farmers in their wills, to Victorian villagers who left trusts to provide for the poor.
Our English ancestors believed that if a community is to thrive, it cannot leave the sick and the starving behind.
In fact, they saw charity as one of the foundations of community.
And you can still see it in action.
This is Kibworth's 24-hour relay to raise money for Cancer Research.
Of course, there's a huge gap between the 14th century and us.
Sometimes, it's hard to believe that we're the same people.
Or that our medieval ancestors would recognise us as their descendants.
But I think they still would.
It's the spirit of Britain, partly crazy, very kind, very generous, very giving.
Really good.
A good friend of ours, Gordon, we kind of did it for him.
And for everybody else that was in need, I suppose.
So, perhaps the values of the medieval world are not so far from us as we might think.
They're still there, running just under the surface of our lives, keeping the connection with the generations of the past, far and near.
Everyone who enters the teams are given one of these bags and a candle.
They decorate the candles and make a dedication to people who have either lost the fight, or are still in the fight, or they just love and are poorly.
Or have survived.
There are lots of survivors, too.
TRANSLATION:
Now Y knowe of parti, but thanne Y schal knowe, as Y am knowun.
But catastrophe also changes us.
After the Black Death, deep social unrest led in 1381 to mass revolt by peasants across England.
But not in Kibworth.
The later outbreaks of plague had brought village society almost to its knees.
The early 15th century was one of the worst times in village history.
But change was in the air.
And driven by the community itself.
In the face of such economic hardship and distress, many people at the time saw that change must come in the relationship between the rulers and the ruled in England.
But the change came in Kibworth not through violent revolution, but through negotiation.
And in 1427, the College took the key step of abolishing all 18 customary tenancies, that's the land holdings which were held by villeins, semi-free peasants who owed work services to their lord.
So, from that moment, if you were an ordinary Kibworthian, you no longer held your land
"in bondagio", in bondage, but "ad voluntatem", at will.
In other words, negotiated with your landlord for a cash rent.
And, at the same time, the College reduced the rents right across the board.
And, then, finally in 1439, a special court was held in Kibworth to cement this relationship.
HE READS IN LATIN
Between the customary tenants of Kibworth, and the scholars of Merton College, Oxford.
It's a document to finalise and record the mutual consent of both parties to the new deal.
It draws the line under the feudal age which has ruled in England since 1066. And even before.
Now, labour services and villeinage are abolished.
You can have your son or daughter inherit your land.
You can take out a leasehold.
You can transfer lands, build up your holdings, amalgamate your tenancies.
You can decide whether you want to be an arable farmer, or whether you want to breed stock.
You can view English history at this time through the lives of kings or queen's, if you like, through the Hundred Years War, and the Wars of the Roses.
But, here is a glimpse at grassroots level of changes that were no less significant in the national story.
By the 1440s, the people of Kibworth, like many villagers throughout England, are on the way to becoming modern people.
So, that's the story of how the medieval villagers of Kibworth survived famine, pestilence, and the Black Death.
Robin Rabble.
That's how the villagers got through England's age of disaster.
And, in the end, came out stronger.
Yummy Mummies...£1,300.
600 years ago, Kibworth was already a deep-rooted community.
The old families, the Polis, the Astins, the Swans, had already lived and worked here for centuries.
But this story is also about a living English community today.
We've been raising funds for six months. And a tough six months.
There's been a recession.
History is not just something that happened back then, in the past.
History, in the end, is now.
And us.
Relay For Life, Kibworth,
2010, raised £65,737!
And it continues.
In the next chapter in the story of England, battle of conscience.
The rise of the English home.
And a new world of Tudor England.

Blood pressure 140/95.
Tachycardia, 145.
- What did you give her?
- 15 mg Diazepam.
- What is her name?
- Emily. Emily Byrne.
Wait. You have to wait here.
REPORTER: FBI agent Emily Byrne was found alive earlier this morning.
Declared dead in absentia,
Byrne is believed to be
- a victim of Conrad Harlow,
- [PHONE RINGING]
the suspect in several additional missing persons cases
currently meeting life imprisonment
for the murder of Emily Byrne.
Nick.
Hey. You heard anything?
Uh, not much. We're kind of in a holding pattern here.
[BEEPING]
Um, I'm sorry. Excuse me, Jack.
- I've tried calling you.
- I know. I'm sorry.
I just saw it on the news.
I just needed a moment.
I understand.
How is she?
I don't know.
Her brother and I, we're waiting for the doctor.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Look, I can't say much right now,
about where she was or...
You don't have to.
Flynn just woke up.
He's picking his clothes for school.
- We shouldn't tell him yet.
- [DOG BARKING]
I want to be there.
Mom, do you have time for waffles?
- Sure, honey.
- [DOG BARKING]
I have to go.
- Okay. Me too.
- I love you.
Okay.
Flynn. Flynn. How do you feel about your mother being alive and back?
[REPORTERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[DOG BARKING]
I should have kept looking for her.
[SIGHS]
No, no... We did everything we could.
You had to do right by Flynn.
And what's he gonna have to deal with now?
How is she?
I am Dr. Fletcher.
- I'm sorry, this is Jack. Emily's brother.
- She's stable.
I know your colleagues will want to speak with her but we need to proceed delicately.
Do you have any idea what happened to her?
No. We're still running tests.
She's having intermittent laryngospasm.
A sudden constricting of the throat usually in response to drowning.
The second she opens her eyes, gentlemen, you will know.
- Right now, she needs to rest.
- Thank you.
Yeah. Thank you.
[SIGHS]
I need to do something.
I need to go to the office.
Let's start with the tank, what the hell was it for?
Custom-made, we're checking region manufacturers.
Water was from the creek at the back, and the lock was on a timer.
CSU found traces of hallucinogens
- and nutrients in water.
- What about the cabin?
We're tracing ownership but locals say no one used it in decades.
- And forensics?
- No prints, no blood, nothing.
Whoever cleaned it was good.
We don't know if she was in there for 6 hours or 6 years.
Had to be in and out of the tank, or the skin would start to break down.
Johnson and Briggs are going house to house in the area to see if anybody saw anyone coming or going.
Vega's flying back from D.C.
He'll assist in Emily's debrief and reassimilation.
Crown, comb Harlow's correspondence.
Every letter, every visitor.
Harlow's gonna walk, isn't he?
Harlow called me.
At my house.
He told me where to find her.
But Harlow's not admitting he made the call.
We tossed his cell, checked the footage... I even grilled him myself.
We know he's involved. He can't walk.
But he went to jail for murder, now he has to be retrialed for abduction.
Still no ID on the river body?
No hits yet.
The killer cut off a man's eyelids.
Someone out there had Emily in that cabin, it's the same person.
We'll protect Emily and we'll catch whoever did it.
Now get to it.
Take Emily's old case files.
Look for anybody who hates her enough to be involved in this.
You're okay?
Good, now let's get him.
Emily...
[GASPING]
[SCREAMING]
Hold her. Hold her.
Grab her hands. Hold her.
Damn journalists had to get in here!
Hold her tight. Yeah, all right.
- Get her out of here.
- Get her out!
NURSE: Calm down, Emily...
- Where is she?
- Hey. Relax, Nick.
All right, what she did?
What she did was an instinctive response.
She perceived that journalist as a threat, and she acted.
- She's still awake?
- Yes. You can see her.
Her father's with her already. Come on.
Emily.
Can you hear me?
We can send them away if that's what you want.
Flynn.
Flynn's great.
He looks so much like you.
- I'll show you.
- I strongly suggest...
I think my daughter wants to see her son.
Here he is.
How long?
Emily.
You've been gone six years.
Please, let's give them some time alone.
Warren, it's all right.
[DOOR CLOSES]
I had the perfect speech prepared.
Emily...
[SOBBING]
- [BEEPING]
- [BUZZER BLARES]
Is this about the call
I'm supposed to have made?
It's quite a mystery.
- Who held my wife in that cabin?
- I wish I knew.
But I have faith you'll find whoever framed me.
How did you communicate with this person... to arrange Emily's release?
Now that she's free, let's talk about my release.
You're trying my patience.
That's the thing about doing time for a crime you didn't commit.
Don't you dare say that.
It builds patience.
I will make sure things happen to you in here.
Things even you wouldn't do to a person.
How about making sure you keep her safe this time?
[GRUNTS]
- Step away!
- Step away, sir!
Get him out of here!
He wore a mask.
It's good. What else?
I never saw his face.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
[SOBBING]
He's... He's still out there.
You're gonna be fine.
I promise you.
Please, I just want to go home.
[WATER RUNNING]
You know you don't have to do this, Emily.
Maybe it's too much too soon.
No. I need to see Flynn.
Okay.
If it gets to be too much, then you just... let me know and we'll get out of there.
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay?
Okay.
[SIGHS]
This is it.
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
- I told you.
- I'm sorry.
They'll be here in 10 minutes.
- How am I supposed to do...
- Alice, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot to fix it.
- Look at this!
I forgot to fix it. I'm sorry.
It's not like I had a ton of time.
You know what I've been going through.
Have I not gone through it?
She just needs to feel welcome.
And she just needs to be with Flynn.
- I know this. I know this, Nick.
- She's not gonna care...
- Why do you think I want everything
- about the goddamn dishwasher.
- to be all right for her to arrive?
- [BELL DINGS]
- EMILY: Oh, hey.
- Oh, come in. Come in.
Um, he's this way.
This is Alice.
Is this Riggs?
Yeah.
Hi, puppy.
[LAUGHS]
- Hello.
- [FOOTSTEPS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS]
Come here.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm happy to see you.
Oh, my God. Look at you.
[SOBS]
Look at you, you're so cute.
And tall.
Flynn, why don't you show your mother your room?
[SNIFFS]
[DISHWASHER WHIRRING]
It's just the dishwasher.
You can sit on my bed if you want.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about downstairs, Flynn.
The last time that I saw you, you were very little.
You hurt my mom.
Your mom? How did I hurt her?
They were fighting. They never fight.
I'm sorry.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
NICK: Emily!
Emily, what happened? What's going on?
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- I don't even know what I'm doing here.
- Hey. Come here, come here, come here.
- Nick, please.
- All right. I know. I know. I know.
- Hey. Hey.
[SOBBING] Hey.
- He hates me. He hates me.
- Hey, no, no.
No.
- He hates me.
- No, he doesn't.
Now listen to me.
- Listen. Listen.
- [SNIFFS]
I'm asking you to fight through this.
Flynn deserves to know the real you.
Just go back inside, Nick.
Go back to your wife.
- [CAR DOOR CLOSES]
- [ENGINE STARTS]
So, this is me.
Um...
The kitchen...
The kitchen's through there.
And the bathroom's back that way with the bedroom.
Hey, give your bag.
Yeah. Okay.
Do you... Do you need anything?
Are you hungry?
Mm-hm.
[SIGHS]
Yeah, um...
I'm selling medical supplies now.
- You don't practice anymore?
- No. No, I lost my license.
Things kind of got away from me... um, after everything that happened but...
Hey, look, it's been...
2 years, 2 months and...
23 days.
So... I-I'm good, Em.
That's good.
Oh, hey, these... came for you.
They were on the doorstep this morning when I got in. I think... they're from your friends at the FBI.
Look, it's late. You must be tired.
Let me show you your room.
- You're gonna stay in mine.
- No. No, it's okay.
I'll sleep on the couch.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I don't wanna put you out.
Well, look, I'll get you some sheets and pillows.
It's like my mind is working against me.
I can't remember anything, except for the mask and...
Harlow's voice...
and the tank.
The FBI, they asked me
if they can observe the sessions from now on.
Do you have any problems with that?
[SOMBER MUSIC]
[PAPER RUSTLING]
Perhaps the eye symbolizes something so...
so dramatic that probably you had to block it.
[SIGHS]
EMILY: I've been reading about these techniques.
There's hypnosis and pentobarbital.
I wanna try one of them.
MAN: There's a reason those aren't accepted
forms of recovered-memory therapy.
Results often aren't reliable, even fantasy.
EMILY: I don't... care.
I will take any result over nothing.
MAN: Have you heard of a process called "cognitive interviewing"?
EMILY: I remember the rhythm.
The pump.
MAN: Stay with the eye, stay with the eye, Emily.
Stay with your vision.
Remember the first time you saw him.
I see a lot of flowers.
Good. That's very good, keep going.
Tell me about the flowers.
Dalia.
Lily.
Rose.
Poppy.
Senna.
Violet.
Jasmine.
Robert Semerov, sex trafficker.
One of Emily's early cases.
She has never come up with enough evidence to make an arrest.
She made him mad enough to take out a contract on her, though.
We've seen her session with Vega, here's the connection.
Robert Semerov had a habit of naming his favorite girls after flowers.
No known address, but we do have this.
That's Semerov's Benz, last night.
Crown, Ericson, find the link between Semerov and Harlow.
The rest of you, find Semerov.
Results came in on the river body.
I found trace amounts of tissue deep under dead man's right index fingernail.
BPD must have missed it.
That's Semerov's skin under that fingernail.
We just need to confirm it.
I already checked, we don't have a sample of his DNA on file.
We'll get one. Try our friends at BPD.
Walk with me.
[INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER]
Detective Gibbs? Thanks.
Take a walk, Feeb.
You stole my body from the Charles.
This is why one of us is coming here to ask you a favor is so awkward.
- And yet, here I am.
- What is it?
I wanna know if you have someone's DNA on file.
Robert Semerov.
Traffics girls from the Eastern block.
- He's not in any system.
- I heard of him.
We were hoping you guys had an evidence file, from an old case.
You think he's the one who took my floater's eyelids?
Will you help me or not?
It's always a one way street with you feds, huh?
Thanks. I'll owe you one.
Riggs. Riggs.
Look at him. He's so cute.
Look at him. Look at Nick.
Hello, honey. Come here.
What's that? What is it?
Oh. What is this?
Come here, Riggs. Come here.
[PHONE BUZZES, BEEPS]
[TYPING]
[BUZZING]
[LOUD FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[DOOR CLOSES]
We need your help.
We think there may be a connection, between one of your old cases and your abduction.
Robert Semerov.
Could he have been at the cabin?
I remember the case, I don't remember seeing him at the cabin.
It doesn't mean he wasn't there.
Just think back...
- I know it's difficult.
- If you don't believe me, Nick.
Why are you even asking the question?
I'm trying to help you, Emily.
- We're in this together.
- Don't say that.
You're not the one who was taken.
You're the one who is fucking somebody else.
Okay. I'll go.
But I'm telling you
Robert Semerov was there.
The girls he trafficked, he gave them all names... flowers.
I watched you rattle
'em off to Dr. Vega.
To Iris, and... and
Dahlia and Lily, and...
Em.
Iris... dahlia...
- lily.
- You need to put those down.
That's evidence.
Yeah, give me forensics.
Emily.
Can you think of anything you would have left out of Semerov's case?
Anything to get us a lead on him?
No.
Hi. Yeah, I need an evidence pickup.
At Jack Byrne's apartment,
Emily's brother's place.
Copy that. I'll text it to you now.
Hey. Y-You were undercover, you know his operation.
Is there any safe houses he used?
Any aliases... that he traveled under?
Did he have any contacts?
There is somebody.
Can you get in touch with him?
She'll only talk to me.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[RUSSIAN ACCENT]:
I saw on the news. How are you?
I'm all right.
I need your help.
You know I owe you.
It's about Semerov.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]:
<b>Please, anything but that.</b>
<b>Anyone but him.</b>
<b>He hurt both of us. But we can stop him.</b>
Where can I find him?
<b>You tried.</b>
I can get him out of your life for good this time, I promise.
<b>The girls talked about a shipment, tomorrow.</b>
<b>Where?</b>
Did you know she was gonna pull us?
No.
If you know how to find Semerov, you have to tell us.
He might be the person who had me, Adam.
I want to be there.
- You know you're not ready for this?
- I am ready.
We just want to protect you.
[SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING]
Emily!
He approved.
This is a one time deal, Emily.
Now what do you have?
Don't move until we see the girls.
Does anyone have eyes on Semerov?
Negative. He should be in the car.
- Around.
- Go.
- FBI! Don't move!
- [GIRLS SCREAMING]
Don't move!
Semerov, halt!
- Emily. Emily.
- MAN: Hands in the air!
Hands where I can see them!
Who are you?
Where is Semerov? Out the vehicle!
Hey, hey, hey.
I don't work with Semerov.
Hands on the car. Come on.
- Go! Go! Fall back!
- Come on.
Come on. Come on.
What? What is it? I can't hear you.
Now is not the time.
Who are you? What's your name, huh?
What's your name? Turn around.
- Where is Semerov?
- I don't know.
Haven't seen him in 2 years.
Where is Semerov? Talk!
- Talk!
- Emily!
[GRUNTING]
Emily. Emily.
- He knows!
- Calm down. Don't look.
- Now calm down.
- Adam. Adam. Adam!
- That was Whitman.
- We got a hit?
The DNA under the nail didn't match Semerov.
- The body itself did.
- What?
The body in the river, it was Semerov.
We've been looking for this guy all over and he was in the morgue the whole time.
- Get inside.
- No.
What about the killer's DNA under the nails?
Unfortunately we got a match on that too.
- Unfortunately?
- The DNA belongs to Emily.
- It's a mistake. Redo it.
- Whitman already did.
Three times.

I like the hat.
I just picked it up.
Did you remember your revolver?
Knew I forgot something.
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.
I think that's quite enough.
You are a doctor, after all.
Always nice to see you. Watson.
Where's the inspector?
He's getting his troops lined up.
HOLMES:
That could be all day.
MAN:
Sherlock Holmes.
And his loyal dog.
Tell me, doctor...
...as a medical man.
Have you enjoyed my work?
Let me show you how much I've enjoyed it.
HOLMES:
Watson. Don't.
Observe.
How did you see that?
Because I was looking for it.
[GLASS SHATTERS]
WATSON:
Lord Blackwood.
You seem surprised.
I'd say the girl deserves your attention more than he.
Indeed.
Oh, I'd leave that alone if I were you, boy-o.
Good lad.
Impeccable timing. Lestrade.
We've one for the doctor...
...and one for the rope.
- Clarkie?
- Sir?
This woman needs a hospital immediately.
Put her in the back of the Moriah.
POLICEMAN 1:
Right, lads. That's it.
POLICEMAN 2: Right. Pick him up, lads.
POLICEMAN 3: Yes, sir.
If you don't mind.
Get him out of my sight.
And you were supposed to wait for my orders.
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor.
Besides, the girl's parents hired me.
Not the Yard.
Why they thought you'd require any assistance is beyond me.
Well. London will breathe a sigh of relief.
Indeed. Congratulations. Lestrade.
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.
MAN:
Gentlemen.
Cheese.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING]

MAN 1: Blackwood hangs tomorrow.

MAN 2: My nerves are the best they've been in years, thanks to you.
Tell me something.
Your new premises...
...when are you moving in?
I should be in within the week.
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.
[GUNSHOTS]
Good God.
- That was gunfire.
- No.
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?
My colleague's probably just putting up a painting.
I'll... I'll go and check.
- Your colleague...
- Yes?
Won't be moving with you, will he?
No, he won't.
Mrs. Hudson.
I won't go in.
Not while he's got a gun in his hand.
You don't have to. Give me the paper.
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.
He just needs another case. That's all.
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know.
Not in a domestic environment.
[GUNSHOT]
Thank you. Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?
- Same time next week.
HUDSON: Come along, captain.
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?
Bring something to cheer him up.
Permission to enter the armory?
HOLMES:
Granted.
Watson. I am in the process of inventing a device...
...that suppresses the sound of a gunshot.
[HOLMES YELLS]
WATSON:
It's not working.
Can I see that?
[FIRE WHISTLING]
You know, it's been three months...
...since your last case.
HOLMES: Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...
[HOLMES YELLS]
Don't you think it's time you found another one?
I can't but agree.
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.
The sooner, the better.
Paper.
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...
...from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.
Is it November?
Yes. Holmes. All right.
Lady Radford reports...
Oh, her emerald bracelet has disappeared.
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies.
Oh. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging.
Yes.
It was our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
[DOOR OPENS]
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...
There's only one case that intrigues me at present:
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson.
The absentee landlady.
I've been studying her comings and goings.
They appear most sinister.
Tea. Mr. Holmes?
Is it poisoned, nanny?
There's enough of that in you already.
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...
...as per usual, nanny.
He's killed the dog. Again.
WATSON:
What have you done to Gladstone now?
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.
He doesn't mind.
Holmes, as your doctor...
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...
...you've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.
There's nothing of interest for me out there, on earth, at all.
- You're free this evening?
- Absolutely.
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.
Mary's coming.
- Not available.
- You're meeting her. Holmes.
Have you proposed yet?
- No. I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.
It's happening, whether you like it or not.
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.
You wear a jacket.
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
A man? Outside my house?
Straighten your tie.
[WATCH TICKING]
WATSON: Holmes.
- Mm.
You're early.
Fashionably.
Miss Mary Morstan.
My goodness. What a pleasure.
I don't know why it's taken him so long to introduce us properly.
Pleasure is mine.
It really is quite a thrill to meet you.
Mr. Holmes.
I've heard so much about you.
I have a pile of detective novels at home.
- Wilkie Collins. Poe.
- It's true.
It can seem a little far-fetched though sometimes...
...making grand assumptions out of tiny details.
That's not quite right, is it?
In fact, the little details are by far the most important.
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...
...hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.
A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war...
...so I can assume he's a decorated soldier.
Strong, brave.
Born to be a man of action.
And neat, like all military men.
Now. I check his pockets.
Ah. A stub from a boxing match.
Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.
He's cost us the rent more than once.
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes.
You know John very well.
What about a complete stranger?
- What can you tell about me?
- You?
- I don't think...
- I don't know that...
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.
- I insist.
- You insist?
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.
- You're a governess.
- Well done.
Yes, well done. Shall we...?
- Waiter?
- Your student...
...is a boy of 8.
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- HOLMES: Charlie, huh?
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.
Is there ink on my face?
There's nothing wrong with your face.
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.
India blue's nearly impossible to wash off.
A very impetuous act by the boy.
But you're too experienced to react rashly...
...which is why the lady for whom you work lent you that.
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.
The jewels you are not wearing tell us more.
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.
The ring is gone.
But the lighter skin suggests...
...that you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly...
...until you were informed of its true, modest worth.
You broke off the engagement...
...and returned to England for better prospects.
A doctor, perhaps.
Right on all counts. Mr. Holmes.
Apart from one.
I didn't leave him.
He died.
Well done, old boy.
[MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.
McMURDO:
Get up and fight.
Fight.
- Finish it.
McMURDO: Come on.
Get up and fight, come on.
Come on.
Get up.
MAN 1:
Get up and fight.
That's it, big man, we're done.
You won, congratulations.
We ain't done yet.
[McMURDO SPITS]
HOLMES: This mustn't register
on an emotional level.
First, distract target.
Then block his blind jab.
Counter with cross to left cheek.
Siscombobulate.
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.
Employ elbow block, and body shot.
Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.
Now fracture.
Break cracked ribs.
Traumatize solar plexus.
Dislocate jaw entirely.
Heel kick to diaphragm.
In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
three ribs cracked, four broken...
...diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...
...full psychological recovery,
six months...
...capacity to spit at back of head...
...neutralized.

MAN:
What the hell's going on here. Charlie?
Lord Blackwood's put him under some kind of spell, sir.
It's like he's burning from the inside out.
You lot, shut up!
Charlie. Charlie!
Take this man to the infirmary, now.
What's this all about, then. Blackwood?
There's someone I want to see.
[STRUMMING VIOLIN]
- Watson?
WATSON: Right.
Let's go.
What started merely as an experiment...
...has brought me to the threshold of a monumental discovery.
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...
...there's no measurable response.
You do know what you're drinking is meant for eye surgery?
But, now...
...and this is remarkable...
...if I change to atonal clusters...
...voila, they fly in counterclockwise.
Synchronized concentric circles...
...as though a regimented flock.
Watson, this is exceptional.
I, using musical theory.
Have created order out of chaos.
How did you lure them in?
Excellent question.
Individually. I've been at it for six hours.
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.
You are Blackwood's last request.
Look at those towering structures.
It's the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge ever attempted.
Most innovative.
What an industrious empire.
Hm?
Oh. I have your winnings from last night.
You weren't there.
So I made your customary bet.
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook.
Locked safely away in my drawer.
Did you know the opera house is featuring Don Giovanni?
I could procure a couple of tickets if you had any cultural inclinations this evening.
[SIGHS]
You have the grand gift of silence.
Watson.
It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
[GROANS]
I knew she'd been engaged.
She had told me.
So that's no to the opera, then?
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.
I want it back.
[CHATTERING]
This way. Mr. Holmes.
Blackwood certainly seems to have got the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.
Which I'm certain will disperse once his feet have stopped twitching.
Care to come along?
No, old cock.
I've no business with him whilst he's alive.
Suit yourself, mother hen.
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.
As though...
...he can get inside their heads.
I can find my own way if you have other duties to perform.
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.
BLACKWOOD:
If any man have an ear, let him hear.
I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up...
...having seven heads and 10 horns.
Upon his heads were the name of blasphemy.
They worshiped the dragon.
Which gave power.
They worshiped, saying.
"Who is like unto the beast?"
The beast which I saw was like a leopard.
His feet were of a bear.
His mouth was of a lion...
...and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority.
I love what you've done with the place.
So glad you could accept my invitation.
I just have a small point of concern.
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.
While my heart went out to the families of the victims...
...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush.
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...
...your work in the crypt was more akin to a finger painting.
So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot.
Either that or, um...
...shortly my friend will pronounce you dead and I thought I might keep him company.
Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly's led to this moment.
Your error of judgment is to assume that I'm holding the brush at all.
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.
You see.
Five lives might have been spared.
Mm. Those lives were a necessity.
Hm.
Sacrifice.
Five meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me dissect your brain.
After you're hanged, of course.
I'd wager there's some deformity that'd be scientifically significant.
Then you, too.
Could serve a greater purpose.
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.
I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events.
You and I are bound together on a journey...
...that will twist the very fabric of nature.
But beneath your mask of logic.
I sense a fragility.
That worries me.
Steel your mind. Holmes.
I need you.
You've come a long way down from the House of Lords.
- And I will rise again.
- Bon voyage.
Pay attention.
Three more will die, and there is nothing you can do to save them.
You must accept that this is beyond your control...
...or, by the time you realize you made all of this possible...
...it'll be the last sane thought in your head.
What did he want?
Not sure.
But I don't think you're needed. Father.
Not for this one.
MAN:
Lord Henry Blackwood...
...you are sentenced to death for the practice of black magic...
...the unholy murder of five innocent young women...
...and the attempted murder of a sixth.
Do you have any final words?
Death...
...is only the beginning.
PRIEST:
...Forever and ever. Amen.
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.
ADLER:
London's so bleak this time of year.
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.
I much prefer to travel in the winter.
Here. I brought you these.
All the way from Syria.
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...
...and your favorite...
...olives from the Cyclades.
Thought we might have a little tea party.
And while I was setting the table.
I found this:
A file with my name on it.
"Theft of Velazquez portrait from king of Spain."
"Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...
...Hapsburg prince to Romanov princess."
I was simply studying your methods...
...should the authorities ask me to hunt you down.
Ah.
But I don't see my name in any of these articles.
But your signature was clear.
Is that the maharajah's missing diamond?
Or just another souvenir?
Let's not dwell on the past.
Shall we?
By the looks of things.
You're between jobs.
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?
He was boring and jealous.
And he snored.
I'm Irene Adler again.
[FARTING]
Thank you.
[SNIFFING]
I need your help.
I need you to find someone.
Why are you always so suspicious?
Shall I answer chronologically or alphabetically?
Careful not to cut yourself on this lethal envelope.
I think you'll find all the information you need inside.
Who are you working for?
So I'll have to find out the hard way?
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.
Well, consider it a wager that you will.
Do you remember The Grand?
They gave me our old room.
Hold the door.
Thanks, doctor.
Ma'am.
- He'll do it.
MAN 1: Well done. Miss Adler.
That's precisely why I hired you.
I wager he'll have our man within the next 24 hours.
MAN 1:
He'd better.
Reordan is the key to what Blackwood was doing.
He's essential to my plan.
MAN 2:
Get off out of it.
MAN 3: What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.
A little rifle range would go a long way, sir...
...rubbing the calluses off these German bands.
God save the queen.
God save the queen, sir.
MAN 2:
Get off out of it.
Look at you.
Why is the only woman you've cared about a criminal?
Are you a masochist?
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.
She's the only adversary who ever outsmarted you. Twice.
Made a proper idiot out of you.
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?
It doesn't matter.
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.
She could sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames.
That's of no consequence to you, is it?
We've done our last case together.
WATSON:
I've already read it.
Missing person:
Luke Reordan. 4 foot 10.
Red hair, no front teeth.
Case solved.
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.
- Midget.
- Do you agree?
No. I don't agree.
It's more than technicality, you see.
You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened peoples.
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No. I am simply stating that one has...
What were you doing?
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.
[YELLS]
WATSON:
Holmes. Where are you going?
[CRASHING AND GLASS SHATTERING]
HOLMES:
Watson.
Watson.
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.
Oh. My lucky day.
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?
Don't move.
Now, what have we got here?
[ADLER GASPS]
It's...
Thank you.
That's the Irene I know.
WOMAN:
Good boy.
This man intrigues me. Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.
She's scared of him.
Yet she works for him.
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...
...but I advise you leave the case alone.
Well. I may not have a choice.
After all. I may be paying the rent on my own soon, thanks to you.
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.
Get what's in your hand out of my face.
CLARK: Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.
Sir. Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me at once.
What's he done now.
Lost his way to Scotland Yard?
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."
No, "you" means you.
CLARK:
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...
Well...
...it appears he's come back from the grave, sir.
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.
I pronounced the man dead myself.
What are the facts?
Groundskeeper saw him walking through the graveyard this morning.
I'll leave this in your capable hands.
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.
Don't try that.
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.
Certainly.
What's the major concern?
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?
Yes, as you should.
It's a matter of professional integrity.
No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.
Who do you think won the match.
Clarkie?
- Sir?
- The rugby match.
Your boys have done a magnificent job obliterating any potential evidence.
Yes. But at least they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
LESTRADE:
You took your time. Holmes.
HOLMES:
"And on the third day"...
These slabs are half a ton each if they're a pound...
...and they're smashed open from the inside.
Lestrade, what of the coffin?
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.
Hm. Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?
Anyhow, where's our witness?
He's over there.
And apparently, he is cata...
Cat...
Catatonic, sir.
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.
If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time.
Now, you get down there and you bring that coffin up now.
Good day, sir.
Hello.
It's all right.
I'm a doctor.
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.
Well?
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.
He had no pulse.
MAN:
Ready.
Down.
Good Lord.
That's not Blackwood.
Well, now we have a firm grasp of the obvious.
Time of death?
Diptera is...
...approximately...
...two thirds of an inch which would put the time of death...
...at between 10 and 12 hours ago.
May I borrow your pen?
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.
GROUNDSKEEPER:
I know what I saw.
It was Blackwood.
As clear as I see you.
And when the dead walk...
...the living will fill these coffins.
Well, um...
[CLEARS THROAT]
LESTRADE: Right.
Put the lid on and clean this lot up.
WATSON:
You really believe he was resurrected?
HOLMES:
The question is not if, but how.
- The game's afoot.
WATSON: Follow your spirit...
HOLMES & WATSON:
And upon this charge, cry:
"God for Harry. England and St. George."
There you are.
Why that certain chips stall.
I don't understand.
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.
WATSON: You know. Holmes.
I've seen things in war I don't understand.
I once met a man who predicted his own death...
...right down to the number and the placement...
...of the bullets that killed him.
You have to admit. Holmes...
...that a supernatural explanation to this case...
...is theoretically possible.
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake to theorize before one has data.
Inevitably one begins to twist facts to suit theories...
...instead of theories to suit facts.
That said. I believe Adler's midget is the key to this.
WATSON:
Hm.
HOLMES: Right. Scratches around the keyhole where the watch was wound.
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.
Every time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches.
Very good. Watson.
You've developed considerable deductive powers of your own. Hm.
Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored...
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H, is for?
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.
They should be able to give us an address.
What a coincidence.
There's one thing you've failed to deduce from the watch.
HOLMES:
Really? I think not.
WATSON:
The time. I have to get back. Holmes.
Taking tea with the in-laws.
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.
WATSON: No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.
We have no need of your lucky heather.
Gypsy woman.
Even if it's to do with Mary?
Oh. Oh.
I see two men. Brothers.
Not in blood, but in bond.
What of Mary?
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.
Go on.
I see patterned tablecloths...
...and, oh, china figurines...
...and, oh, lace doilies.
Doilies.
Lace doilies? Holmes.
Does your depravity know no bounds?
- No.
- Oh, she turns to fat...
...and, oh, she has a beard and...
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?
Please, enough.
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.
And precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring.
Do you have my money?
You are terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre.
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!
HOLMES:
I see.
Thank you.
HOLMES: Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.
And I have some change in my pocket.
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.
- Don't give it away here.
- No.
I have to go see Mary.
Give her my best.
And her family, as well.
It does make a considerable difference to me...
...having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.
Well, you can rely on me for exactly 10 minutes.
He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
HOLMES:
Something did.
Irene Adler was here.
Either that or the ginger midget wore the same Parisian perfume.
[INHALES]
Ah. Putrefaction.
[SNIFFING]
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.
[FLIES BUZZING]
Phosphorous.
Formaldehyde.
It looks like...
...he was attempting to combine...
...some kind of sorcery and scientific formula.
HOLMES:
More importantly...
...let's see what he was trying to dispose of.
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink as long as it's not too burnt.
Peculiar.
Hydrated rhododendron.
[SNIFFS]
- Holmes.
- Hm?
Look at the crest.
Reordan was working with Blackwood.
Of course he was.
The question is, to what end.
Whatever he was working on.
He clearly succeeded.
How so?
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.
Which is why Miss Adler is so desperate to find him.
HOLMES:
Yes.
HOLMES:
Yes.
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.
- Mm?
- Is it candy floss? Molasses?
Maple syrup?
Barley sugar.
Toffee apple.
Let me guess.
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...
...you're here to burn down the building and extinguish all evidence therein.
Just one minute, boys.
Oh. Dredger.
[HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
Meat...
...or potatoes?
My 10 minutes are up.
[GRUNTING]
[IN FRENCH]
[IN FRENCH]
WATSON:
You all right?
[BUZZING]
[GROANING]
Holmes...
...what is that?
DREDGER:
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTING]
[THUDS]
HOLMES:
HOLMES:
HOLMES:
WATSON:
Holmes!
[IN ENGLISH] Watson...
...what have you done?
WATSON:
I haven't slept all night.
Not a wink.
Why I ever believed...
...that I would get to have tea with Mary's parents is beyond me...
- ...having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.
I've been reviewing my notes on our exploits over the last seven months.
Would you like to know my conclusion?
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?
Why else would I continually be led into situations...
...where you deliberately withhold your plans from me? Why else?
You've never complained about my methods before.
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?
How am I complaining? I never complain.
Do I complain about you practicing the violin in the morning...
...or your mess, your lack of hygiene.
Or the fact that you steal my clothes?
We have a barter system.
Do I complain about you setting fire to my rooms?
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.
When do I complain that you experiment on my dog?
- Our dog.
- On the dog.
Gladstone is our dog.
Where I do take issue is your campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
I understand.
- Do you?
- I do.
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.
I'm not sensitive.
What you need is a rest.
My brother. Mycroft.
Has a small estate near Chichester.
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country.
It would be with my future wife.
- Well, certainly, if we must...
- No, not you. Mary and I.
- You are not...
- What, invited?
Why would I not be invited to my brother's country home?
Now you're not making any sense.
You're not human.
MAN:
John Watson?
Yes.
Your bail's been posted.
WATSON:
Mary.
Just Watson.
I hope you get bail by breakfast.
Because the boys are getting hungry.
[CHATTERING]
LESTRADE:
Step lively.
Back off. Back off.
To which the barman says.
"May I push in your stool?"
[MEN LAUGHING]
Right, you, you're out.
Until next time. Big Joe.
Always a pleasure. Mr. Holmes.
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.
In another life.
You'd have made an excellent criminal.
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.
Now, please tell me you have answers.
All in good time. Lestrade.
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor game where we guess what you're thinking?
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...
...I'll have you in there playing Victoria and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.
Now, clean up and make yourself presentable.
For whom?
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.
[BLOWING NOSE]
I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, sir...
...but I'm gonna have to put this on you.
Mr. Holmes.
Apologies for summoning you like this.
I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are and who I am.
As to where I am...
...I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.
But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill...
...the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...
...a Brittany sage.
The carriage forked left, then right.
A telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.
And as to who you are, that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.
The letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram.
Lord Chief Justice.
That'd be your official title.
Who you really are is, of course.
Another matter entirely.
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...
...you're the head of the Temple of the Four Orders...
...in whose headquarters we now sit...
...on the northwest corner of St. James's Square. I think.
As to the mystery, the only mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me at all.
Yes, well, standard procedure.
I suppose.
[DOOR OPENS]
I daresay we have the right man.
Gentlemen.
Sherlock Holmes.
Ambassador Standish from America...
...and Lord Coward, the home secretary.
I suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our order.
HOLMES:
Yes. Um...
They're practically interesting.
Be as skeptical as you like.
But our secret systems have steered the world towards good for centuries.
The danger is they can also be used for more nefarious purposes.
What some call the dark arts.
Or practical magic.
STANDISH: We know you don't believe in magic. Mr. Holmes.
We don't expect you to share our faith...
...merely our fears.
Fear is the more infectious condition.
In this instance...
...fear of your own child.
Blackwood is your son.
You have the same irises.
A rare dark green...
...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...
...together with identical outer ears, which are only passed down through bloodline...
...which makes you either brothers...
...or, in this case, more likely.
Father and son.
Very few people are privy to that information...
...and we want to keep it that way.
He was conceived during one of our rituals.
His mother wasn't my wife...
...but she shared our beliefs.
She was a powerful practitioner...
...though not enough to survive giving birth to him.
Death followed him wherever he went.
Those five girls were not the first to be butchered.
He killed many more.
Using them to enhance his powers.
No one could prove anything.
Of course, but we all knew.
The boy was a curse.
We've done our best to stop him.
But it's not enough.
His power grows daily.
His resurrection is evidence of that.
But what he does next will be more dangerous.
ROTHERAM: His secret lies in the book of spells. This is the source of his power.
He's gonna raise a force that will alter the course of world.
We want you to find him and stop him before he does.
COWARD: We'll give you any assistance that we can.
As home secretary. I have considerable influence over the police.
HOLMES:
Hm, yes.
COWARD:
So...
...name your price.
The benefit of being a consulting detective...
...is that I can pick and choose my clients.
So consider it done. I'll stop him.
But not for you.
And certainly not for a price.
- I do have a parting query. Sir Thomas.
- What is that?
If the rest of his family's dead.
How long do you expect to survive?
Food for thought.
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck opening that.
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.
How fascinating that an astronomical event can affect the quality...
How is it going with our case you refuse to take?
...of the wine.
Oh. I've hit a dead end, literally.
I found your man.
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.
If you still need him.
Oh, dear.
Hope my client doesn't come looking for a refund.
He's a professor, isn't he?
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.
I've never known a professor to carry a gun.
And on such a clever contraption.
Eye patch, nice touch.
So case closed...
...which makes this a social visit.
No, it's a "you're in over your head.
Irene" visit.
Whoever killed Reordan was covering their tracks...
...which makes you the next loose end to be snipped.
[CORK POPS]
Let it breathe.
I've never been in over my head.
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.
Or stay and volunteer for protective custody.
If I'm in danger, so are you.
Come with me.
What if we trusted each other?
Hm?
You're not listening.
I'm taking you to either the railway station or the police station.
[SIGHS]
So...
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.
You decide.
- Which will it be?
- What...?
I told you to let it breathe.
Can you taste the comet?
Why couldn't you just come away with me?
Never.
[CAWS]
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[GASPS]
[SCREAMS]
Madam. I need you to remain calm and trust me. I'm a professional.
But beneath this pillow lies the key to my release.
- She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
CLARK: Naturally, sir.
That's why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling.
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.
Indeed. And chambermaids were once such a liberal breed.
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended.
Or we may never have found you.
The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning, sir.
- Just joking about the wife, sir.
- Oh.
CLARK:
We've checked everything, sir.
No sign of a break-in and the butler didn't hear a thing.
So body in the bathtub...
...his eyes were wide open.
And the only thing missing was...
...his ring, sir.
Why did you drain the water?
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer.
Not provide comfort for the corpse.
What is that?
[SNIFFS]
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...
...high up where it's warm and dry.
Or in a linen cupboard with a vent.
Constable, you could do worse...
...than to check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints.
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.
[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
CLARK:
Mr. Holmes?
[HUMMING]
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?
It was in the pantry, sir.
I don't know what to make of this.
Excellent work.
Adieu.
[BELL TOLLING]
What's the meaning of this. Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?
Sir Thomas is dead.
I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the order.
[CHUCKLES]
Have you lost your mind?
You know damn well what he's capable of.
BLACKWOOD:
Of course he does.
That's why we're here.
That's why we're all here.
My powers and my assets were given to me for one purpose.
A magnificent but simple purpose.
To create a new future.
A future ruled...
...by us.
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step towards a new chapter in our history.
Magic will lead the way.
Once the people of England see our newfound power...
...they'll bow down in fear.
Across the Atlantic lies a colony that was once ours.
It will be again.
The Civil War has made them weak.
Their government is as corrupt and as ineffective as ours...
...so we'll take it back.
We will remake the world...
...create the future.
These men are with me. Standish...
...but...
...are you?
No, sir. I am not.
These powers that you're playing with...
...no man can control.
Well, gentlemen...
...someone has to stop him.
Even if you won't.
Oh. I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[YELLING]
STANDISH:
Save me!
Gentlemen...
...don't be afraid.
As you can see...
...we are protected.
Come, drink your allegiance here.
You control the police, now use them.
Didn't know you were here.
Since this room is no longer yours.
Do you mind if I utilize it?
Be my guest.
- In here, chaps.
MAN: Where would you like me...
- ...to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.
WATSON: Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.
His neck didn't survive the impact of Dredger landing on him.
Yes.
Thanks for that, by the way.
There is consolation in the knowledge that he could be of service to his fellow man.
Elbows and arms stained with blood.
But it's older than his own injuries.
None of it human.
He's not a butcher, let me see.
Yellow flame, green bursts.
An industrial worker.
[SNIFFING]
Pff. Coal.
River silt.
The slag on his trousers should put him squarely in...
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry. What?
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.
I wondered.
Do you remember where I put the Lords Register of members' interests?
It's on the stepladder.
Well. Blackwood's had his hand in just about everything that's corrosive to the spirit.
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.
It'll probably be a factory by the river.
What's that?
Never mind.
You don't know where my rugby ball went, do you?
No, not a clue.
Queenshi the Slaughterhouse.
Nine Elms.
A factory by the river.
Well done. That should lead us to Blackwood, dead or alive.
Not us.
You.
Yes.
Just a figure of speech, old boy.
He's left it there on purpose.
[GRUNTS]
[GROANS]
[MEN LAUGHING]
More coal, doctor.
That's a good one. He's such a tit.
Oh. God. Yeah.
WATSON: Glad to see you two are working hard.
And I thought we were trying to be discreet.
You would not last one day in the navy.
Are you sure there isn't an alternative means of water transportation than that?
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.
If only just a sense.
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.
Come on, come on.
WATSON: Look familiar?
HOLMES: Yep.
All that's missing is a ginger midget.
They cleared something away from here not minutes ago.
Like what?
Not sure. Something mechanical.
Holmes.
Look at this.
- Chapter and verse.
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."
BLACKWOOD:
"And behold. I'm alive for evermore."
I warned you. Holmes, to accept that this was beyond your control...
...beyond what your rational mind could comprehend.
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
BLACKWOOD: I want you to bear witness.
Tomorrow, at midday.
The world as you know it will end.
Show me your face.
It'll be the end of your world.
Save your bullets. Watson.
A gift for you.
[GUN CLICKING EMPTY]
What was that about saving bullets?
[GRUNTING]
BLACKWOOD:
She followed you here. Holmes.
You led your lamb to slaughter.
Holmes.
This game was designed to hurt.
Watson!
It's warm in here. Watson.
In over your head yet, darling?
WATSON: Hold on there.
ADLER: I can't.
Let me take your weight.
HOLMES:
Give us a leg up, old boy.
[GROANS]
These German locks always give me trouble.
[METAL CREAKING]
It's a band saw.
No matter, we have plenty of time.
Holmes.
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.
Holmes, hurry up.
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.
And we'll bounce in three, two...
...one.
Thank you.
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.
Thank you.
We should help the doctor.
Holmes!
CLARK [IN SLOW MOTION]:
Mr. Holmes.
Sir.
Mr. Holmes.
Mr. Holmes, we have an order for your arrest, sir.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Sir!
Lord Coward has issued a warrant for your arrest, sir.
Now. Watson's alive.
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Will the train be departing on time?
The train's been delayed, madam.
Shouldn't be long now, though.
MAN:
The train will depart when I tell it to.
And you will leave my employment when I allow you to.
I fulfilled my contract.
I found Reordan.
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.
So that's me. Finished.
MAN: Your job was to manipulate Holmes' feelings for you...
...not succumb to them.
You have fulfilled nothing.
I want what Reordan was making for Blackwood.
Finish the job or the next dead body...
...will be Sherlock Holmes.
DOCTOR:
The surgeon should be along shortly.
He should be able to rest now.
Excuse me.
Is that the best you can do?
Yes, for now.
I must attend to my other patients.
MARY:
Doctor.
Doctor.
Please.
I know that you care for him as much as I do.
This is not your responsibility.
It was his choice.
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.
[SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]
Solve this.
Whatever it takes.
[VOICES CHATTERING]
BLACKWOOD:
This is beyond your control.
CLARK:
Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
ADLER: I've never been in over my head.
WATSON: it's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.
MARY: Solve this.
WATSON: Are you, Holmes?
BLACKWOOD:
Accept that this was beyond your control.
- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
LESTRADE: I've got a public in frenzy.
WATSON:
Holmes!
BLACKWOOD:
Widen your gaze.
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.
ROTHERAM: He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.
COWARD: His power grows daily.
ROTHERAM: This is the source of his power.
BLACKWOOD:
I need you.
ROTHERAM:
His secret lies in the book of spells.
BLACKWOOD:
Three more will die...
...and there is nothing you can do to save them.
STANDISH:
We know you don't believe in magic.
WATSON:
Reordan was working with Blackwood.
ADLER:
Is that better?
WATSON: He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.
His eyes were wide open and the only thing missing was his ring.
BLACKWOOD:
Give up, Holmes.
This is a riddle you cannot solve.
ADLER:
Good morning.
Now, you need to work.
Familiar artwork.
You look gorgeous.
HOLMES:
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.
You made the front page.
Only a name and no picture.
So it looks like you'll be needing to work outside the law now...
...and that's my area of expertise.
I feel safer already.
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.
Yes.
Took the shrapnel out myself.
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.
Well. I'm...
I'm just so...
...very glad that you're...
...well...
...with us.
[BOTH CLEAR THROATS]
Now that you're sitting comfortably.
I shall begin.
My initial approach was far too narrow.
When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville Prison...
...he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum. I have done just that.
In fact. I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity.
But that's for another time.
Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system...
...that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.
To fully understand the system.
To get inside it...
...I reenacted the ceremony we interrupted at the crypt...
...with a few enhancements of my own.
My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended...
...and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail.
I have emerged enlightened.
The fraternity who silently control the empire...
...share the belief with the kings.
Pharaohs and emperors of old...
...that the sphinx was a door to another dimension...
...a gateway to immeasurable power.
It's made up of four parts:
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...
...the wings of an eagle.
And the head of a man.
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...
...the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle and hair of a man.
Map.
The points of the star represent the five murdered girls...
...but the cross is what we're now interested in.
It's a widely held belief...
...that within the architecture of the great cities...
...are coded references to this system.
Since he rose from the grave.
Blackwood has killed three men...
...each committed at a location that has a connection with the temple...
...therefore the system.
Reordan, the ginger midget, represents man.
We found his body here.
Sir Thomas. Master of the temple.
Wore the ox ring.
He died here.
Standish, ambassador to America...
...where the eagle has been the national emblem for over 100 years.
The headquarters of the Temple of the Four Orders where he died...
...is here.
Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act.
So we have man. The ox. Eagle.
Only the lion remaining.
Right here.
Parliament.
Right.
You four stay here and the rest of you come with me.
LESTRADE: Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.
Ladies first.
LESTRADE:
Now.
HOLMES:
Follow these instructions.
- Aren't you...?
HOLMES: Go.
Hello, hello, hello.
Did the devil turn up?
Well...
...never mind.
You got the next best thing.
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...
...but Mr. Holmes here...
...he's been making some serious accusations about you...
...and the order.
I see.
Well, at least that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector.
[BOTH GRUNT]
[HOLMES COUGHS]
Excuse me, my Lord...
...but I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
Well, inspector. I have five minutes before my next engagement...
...so why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracy?
Thank you. Lestrade.
My Lord.
I'm curious. Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...
...or just the one I prevented?
Very distinctive.
Those handmade shoes of yours.
But the price of quality is often the unique imprint they leave.
Nonetheless. I confess to being completely outmatched.
I could deduce very little from my investigation.
Fortunately.
There's nothing more stimulating...
...than a case where everything goes against you.
How many members of Parliament do you intend to murder at noon today?
Man, ox, eagle, lion.
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?
Very clever.
But it's not murder. Mr. Holmes.
It's mercy.
We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd.
Don't you see that it's for their own...?
HOLMES:
No, but I don't care much what you think.
I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's ceremony...
...and you've given it to me.
I've told you nothing.
HOLMES: But your clothes say infinitely more than you could ever hope.
The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.
You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony...
...in the sewers beneath Parliament less than an hour ago.
Both houses meet today.
The whole government will be present.
COWARD: It's a shame you made an enemy out of Blackwood. Holmes.
You would have made a valuable ally.
How terrible is wisdom...
...when it brings no profit to the wise.
We take power at noon.
There isn't any time to waste then.
Is there?
TANNER: I told you he'd be coming out the top window.
There isn't any way he'd be coming over that terrace.
Technically, that isn't the top window.
Is it, sailor boy?
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.
Anyway.
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.
In fact. I think he enjoyed it.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Here's the key.
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes. I smoked him out with relative ease.
- Tanner?
- Sir?
If you would, captain...
...take us under the bridge.
Port side. 100 yards.
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel that leads us to the sewers.
Right away, sir.
[HORN BLOWS]
[CHATTERING]
The end is nigh.
Blackwood's come back from hell and laid a curse upon this land.
He walks in every shadow and every puff of smoke.
Behold, he cometh with clouds...
...and every eye shall see him...
...and every soul shall wail because of him.
You cannot stop him!
No one can!
[WHISPERING]
Behold. Blackwood's magic revealed.
ADLER [WHISPERING]: What does it do?
HOLMES: It's a chemical weapon.
The first of its kind.
You deduced that how?
From my pocket.
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse.
Note the blue discoloration.
The faint smell of bitter almonds.
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
ADLER: Cyanide.
WATSON:
Shh.
HOLMES: Now we know what the ginger midget was working on.
It'll revolutionize warfare.
[WHISPERING] Yes, killing a lot of people.
Now, it's seven minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?
Right. How many men did you count on the...?
[GUNSHOTS]
She loves an entrance, your muse.
HOLMES [IN NORMAL TONE]:
Woman!
Shoot him. Now, please.
My lords.
My lords.
My lords.
The time has come...
...for only those who believe to remain.
Behold...
...Lord Blackwood.
[MURMURING]
You seem surprised.
I have returned from beyond the grave to fulfill England's destiny...
...and extend the boundaries of this great empire.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING
IN DISTANCE]
Listen to the rabble outside.
Listen...
...to the fear.
I will use that as a weapon...
...to control them...
...and then the world.
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.
Specifically designed to prevent us from disarming it.
These appear to be designed to receive a signal of some sort.
Electromagnetic waves?
HOLMES:
When triggered, the electrodes...
...will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.
The gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation system...
...that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...
...the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.
Blackwood must have some transmitter that he can activate remotely.
Three minutes. 10 seconds.
I will create an empire that will endure for millennia...
...indestructible...
...and eternal.
Move it. Move it.
We don't actually have to disarm the device...
...we just have to remove the cylinders.
Yes, except that they're welded in.
What we need is a controlled explosion.
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.
[GRUNTS]
[GUN CLICKING EMPTY]
[IN FRENCH]
I rather wish you hadn't done that.
Irene.
[BELL CHIMING]
On the 12th chime.
I will summon the dark powers.
All those of you who are with me shall be protected.
All others...
...will perish.
I need your pipe.
Nut him!
- Right.
- What?
- Coat.
- Got it.
The new order...
...begins now.
Woman.
What are you waiting for?
[POPS]
[GROANS]
That.
MAN:
Apprehend Lord Coward.
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.
Relax...
...I'm a doctor.
[SCREAMS]
Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?
We're safe now.
Interesting assessment.
Run off.
I won't be chasing you anymore.
Fare thee well.
I don't want to run anymore.
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.
No!
There was never any magic.
Only conjuring tricks.
The simplest involved paying people off...
...like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.
Your reputation and the inmates' fear did the rest.
Others required more elaborate preparations...
...like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb.
You had it broken before your burial.
Then put back together using an adhesive.
An ancient Egyptian recipe. I believe...
...a mixture of egg and honey...
...designed to be washed away by the rain.
Holmes!
Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub...
...required more modern science.
Very clever of Reordan to find a paralytic...
...that was activated by the combination of copper and water...
...and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.
That might've been a challenge for me...
...had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians.
The death of Standish was a real mystery...
...until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf.
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...
...yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue.
Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered the temple?
All it took was a spark.
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.
Ingenious.
Like all great performers, you saved your piece de resistance for the end:
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.
Had it worked...
...your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed...
...as their colleagues were dying around them.
They didn't know you'd given them the antidote.
Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...
...and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.
And the world would've followed.
Fear being the most powerful weapon of all.
[CREAKING]
You'd better hope that it's nothing more than superstition...
...as you performed all the rituals perfectly.
The devil is due a soul, I'd say.
For God's sake. Holmes, cut me loose.
[METAL CREAKING]
HOLMES: First, the world will see you for what you are. A fraud.
Then you'll be hanged.
Properly, this time.
It's a long journey from here to the rope.
[YELLING]
[GRUNTS]
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.
I have.
Naked.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
ADLER:
Storm's coming.
HOLMES:
Well, we've still got a moment.
Moriarty.
What?
That's his name.
And he is a professor.
Everyone has a weak spot...
...and he found mine.
Where was it, precisely?
- Please don't underestimate him.
- Mm.
He's just as brilliant as you are...
...and infinitely more devious.
We'll see about that.
You'll miss me. Sherlock.
Sadly...
...yes.
WATSON:
Just keep it under your hat.
DRIVER: Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.
WATSON: Thank you.
- What's in these. John?
Scribbles.
- Scribbles?
- Notes.
MARY: They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.
[WATSON CHUCKLES]
Come on, what's wrong?
Do you think he's come to terms with you leaving?
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.
Now, five minutes here and we'll go home.
Our home.
Get up those stairs.
[KNOCKING]
Don't worry, dear.
Suicide is not in his repertoire.
He's far too fond of himself for that.
Holmes.
Oh. Good afternoon.
I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution.
Clearing your good name, as it were.
But it had a surprisingly soporific effect...
...and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.
WATSON:
Get on with it. Holmes.
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook.
Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.
John, shouldn't we help him down?
No, no, no.
I hate to cut him off midstream.
Carry on.
Well, the executioner attached it to a harness...
...allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...
...and the neck to remain intact.
My Lord. I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?
How did you manage it. Holmes?
I managed it with braces.
Belts and a coat hook.
Please, my tongue is going.
I'll be of no use to you at all.
- Worse things could happen.
- John.
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.
HOLMES:
Right.
Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.
There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum.
It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...
...for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis.
Enough to mislead a medical mind even as well-trained as your own.
- It's known as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?
HOLMES:
...Mad honey disease.
Oh, he's demonstrating the very effect I've just described.
He doesn't mind.
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.
CLARK:
Mr. Holmes?
Doctor. Miss Mary.
Sir. Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me right away.
- What is it is this time. Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.
He went missing the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.
I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.
We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene.
Can I help you, officer?
Shot in the head.
Was it a small caliber bullet?
Yes.
Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?
Indeed, sir.
Point blank range?
Moriarty.
Professor Moriarty.
MARY:
Oh, there's a good boy.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Where is Blackwood's device now?
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.
I'd wager there's a piece missing.
So Moriarty was after a piece of the machine...
...not the poison.
There's nothing more elusive than an obvious fact.
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.
And Adler was just the diversion.
He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.
A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.
Imagine being able to control any device...
...simply by sending a command via radio waves.
It's the future. Watson.
[KNOCKING]
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.
- Well...
- Well...
[GLADSTONE GROANS]
MARY: Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.
HOLMES:
Clarkie.
Case reopened.
The winners of this challenge get to go to the finale.
To make it this far is just unbelievable.
There's only three people standing between me and 100 grand.
This is the last chance to show that I have what it takes.
In a season of life and death, four artists have thrived.
But which three will keep the dream alive and make it to the finale?
Don't hold anything back.
- So much to do.
- Yeah, right.
All aspects of this makeup have to be perfect.
The worst foam in the world.
- You have a lot of work to do.
- Ew!
I bit off more than I can chew.
I've got several surprises in store for you tonight.
Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com
- What's happening?
- I don't know. What is this?
We show up to the studio, and we're walking through all these different sets.
And I have no idea what's going on.
Oh, God.
Oh, creepy.
Every ten feet, it's like you're in a different world almost.
- Weird office or something.
- Yeah.
I'm confused.
We get to this elaborate courthouse set, and at the end of the walkway, there's McKenzie.
What?
I'm super excited.
There's a newsstand.
And the newspapers have all of these really sensational headlines.
- What the hell is a Yeti Crab?
- I don't know, but I love it.
- Hey, guys.
All: - Hey.
Welcome to DC Stages in downtown Los Angeles.
This location and its massive variety of standing sets has been featured in dozens of films and television shows, like Alias, X-Files, and Iron Man 2.
Cool.
Now, you're next spotlight challenge is inspired by two infamous movie monsters that made a name for themselves destroying some of the world's most recognizable skylines.
Are any of you Godzilla or King Kong fans?
- Yeah.
- Of course.
Now, Godzilla and King Kong are forever associated with iconic buildings like the Tokyo Tower in Japan and the Empire State Building in New York City.
Each of these newspapers features a bold headline... an image of a famous landmark that's been devastated by some type of monstrous creature.
So your spotlight challenge is to choose one of these newspapers and use its headline and imagery as inspiration for your very own giant monster.
Yes! Yes!
I love giant monsters!
I am ecstatic.
This is like a dream challenge... to get to make a giant monster.
I gotta calm down. I'll pass out.
All right.
So our headlines are...
"Yeti Crab Crushes Kremlin,"
"Giant Sloth Slashes Shanghai,"
"Mantis Preys On Paris,"
"Deadly Squid Destroys Dubai," and "Taj Terrorized
By Pterodactyl."
All right, guys, I want you to choose carefully, because this is your last chance to show the judges that you are capable of earning a spot in the finale.
This is dream come true.
I've always wanted to make a giant monster, but I am terrified, because I just need to get the spot in the finale.
- Dina.
- Oh, God.
I'm gonna do this.
Cig, you're next.
I don't know. I'm gonna go with Yeti crab.
- Ah!
- Squid.
- I'm going with the sloth.
- All right.
All right, guys, I have an exciting surprise for you.
I want to introduce you to a very special guest.
He's starred in dozens of hit films, like Star Trek, Capote, Traffic, and appropriately for today's challenge,
Guillermo del Toro's
Pacific Rim.
Please give a warm welcome to Emmy-nominated actor
Clifton Collins, Jr.
Clifton Collins, Jr. has done a lot of productions with makeup effects and especially giant monsters.
So I'm stoked to see him here.
- Hi.
- Hi. Thank you so much
- for being here.
- Thanks for having me.
- I'm a big fan.
- I should also tell you guys that Clifton will be joining us on the reveal stage this week to see your final makeups.
So, as one of the stars of Pacific Rim, you've seen your fair share of giant monsters.
- I have.
- What do you think it is that gets the audience so excited?
For me, it's, like, the nostalgia.
Having grown up on, like, big, giant robot or Godzilla or any of these monster movies, to become an adult and see these creatures brought back to the screen is just a great time.
What are you gonna be looking for in their final creation?
I'm gonna be looking for originality and attention to detail.
I think, as a character actor,
I'm always hunting for those minute, little details
- that make the difference.
- Very cool.
Thank you so much.
All right, guys, it's time to get started on your sketches.
And remember, don't hold anything back, because it's now or never, if you want to prove to the judges that you belong in the final three.
See you later on at the lab.
Good luck.
Good luck, guys.
I got
"Mantis Preys On Paris."
The cool thing about praying mantises is the females actually eat the heads of their mates.
So my concept is she ate tons of them and grew into a giant monster.
I have to do wings, face, cowl, arms, legs, and then they have this whole lower body part that I'm probably gonna have to fabricate.
I have to just go all out in this challenge.
I want the judges to see that
I don't just do pretty things.
I can do creepy.
I like sloths.
They're real stupid and slow and cute.
So it's gonna be fun trying to take that and transform it into a hideous, scary monster.
My concept for my giant sloth that destroys Shanghai is an ancient, forgotten creature that has been brought to the modern world and basically just goes crazy.
So he's gonna have longer arms with really long claws, some sparse hair, and shortened legs.
I'm not holding anything back this time.
Like, it's a monster challenge, a giant-monster challenge.
So I'm going giant monster, all the way.
- How's your squid monster?
- It's a squid man.
Yeah?
Let me see.
My concept is this radioactive mutant squid.
The squid is growing bigger and bigger, until he goes on a rampage in Dubai.
They're all soft and squishy, except for this big, bad-ass beak that can just, like, rip apart Dubai, apparently.
I think I'm gonna put the mouth, like, on his chest.
- Cool.
- How's your Yeti crab?
It's gonna have, like, Yeti face and, like, carapace going back.
- That's cool.
- And then it has, like, big forearms.
So my story is that the Yeti crab is actually a mutant byproduct of the Chernobyl disaster.
And the Russian government captured it, but it's too strong, and it breaks out.
Now it's just pissed off, so it just starts crushing the city.
- So much to do.
- Yeah, right.
Hey, guys.
Let's go back to the lab and start our monsters.
Yeah.
It's day one of our giant-monster challenge, and we have six hours in the lab.
So much to do.
I'm on Cloud Nine.
I get to make a giant monster.
I'm gonna sculpt a cowl and a face piece.
Then I'm gonna try to fabricate an entire creature suit that ends in crab claws and have, like, armored plates all throughout.
I start with just the basic ape sculpt, and add some other stylized elements into the gorilla face.
It's a monstrous amount of work.
The mantis eyes are, you know, on the side of its head.
So I find these giant, plastic half globes that are perfect for its eyes, so stick those right into my sculpt.
And then I'm gonna try to hide my model's eyes in the nostrils, so I start working on the face and the cowl at the same time because it needs to match perfectly, or this is not gonna work.
All right, this is my fourth bag of clay.
What are you making there...
- chest piece?
- Yeah.
A squid is not all that scary, just this gross, slimy thing.
So I start sculpting this big, thick beak right in the center of my model's chest, with all these rings and spikes.
The beak's gonna look like it can destroy a whole city.
Got to just be a pit of destruction in its chest.
It's gonna sell the scary aspect.
Do you like him?
Yeah.
I love sloths.
It's like, they're adorable.
What can they possibly do?
I'm spending a lot of time trying to make sure
I don't go too sloth-y, which will just turn out to be a giant cute monster, so I'm spreading out the eyes so that he's still sort of dopey and cute-looking, but also somewhat menacing and more like a giant, scary sloth.
Hey, guys.
We're here to check in on you.
- Hey, George.
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. How you doing?
- Hi, George.
- Good to see you.
- All right, so you have
- "Deadly Squid Destroys Dubai."
- Yeah.
So I'm gonna have these giant eyes and the face split, and these will blend into the tentacles that are his arms.
And then the beak is gonna be on his chest.
What about color now?
The paint job is the thing
I'm most looking forward to.
Tans with some, like, blue spotting and patterns and stuff around it.
Well, you don't want to get muddy either.
- No.
- When you talk about tans, you don't want to, all of a sudden, start to shade and get it too dark.
Octopus and squid, you find reds and blues and purples.
- Mm-hmm.
- So you can easily work those
- into your shadows around there.
- Yeah.
All right, so remind us what you chose today.
"Mantis Preys On Paris."
- That's right.
- I like your face.
Should I white her eyes out maybe?
No, I wouldn't whiten them,
'cause that's gonna pop right out.
If anything, bring your shading all the way through here and really just go all the way down
- with the aqua color plus...
- Yeah, yeah.
'Cause it'll last, and then take a black pencil and do the table of the eye to get rid of any pink
- that's in there.
- Right.
So, yeah, here he is.
I'm trying to change the silhouette so that he has a wider, like, stockier head, basically.
Mm-hmm.
Since you are so thick here, score it from the inside, before you put it on him,
- so it'll bend.
- Okay.
In fact, I would even, with this one here, so he could get more of that, would be to literally tear some out.
Score it and tear some out of it,
'cause then it will have something, you know, to fold into.
- Okay.
- All right.
So you got
"Yeti Crab Crushes Kremlin."
Yep. I thought that no collection of giant monsters would be complete without a simian-esque monster.
So I'm gonna make the overall look very apelike...
Mm-hmm.
With the carapace and exoskeleton of the crab.
- Uh-huh.
- This is gonna look like
- a gorilla in a crab costume.
- Mm-hmm.
I was really happy with the face.
But this is definitely a wrench in the gears.
It'd probably be a good idea to sell a little bit more crab in the face so it isn't all simian, you know, really tie the two together.
- Okay.
- You have a lot of work to do.
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck.
Thank you.
Fuck. I want to take
Mr. Westmore's advice to sell the crab more, but I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with the face.
I don't know.
I'm not seeing it.
I don't have time to be thrown off, because I have to still fabricate an entire creature suit, so it's really frustrating.
But at this point, I just have to walk away from it.
Coming up...
What the fuck?
At the end of the day, there's gonna be one person that's gonna be sent home, and it's nerve-racking.
So, I think it's a very successful makeup.
I struggle with this.
I appreciate your swinging for the fences.
Fuck.
It's day one of our giant-monster challenge, and I'm nervous because
I'm running out of time today, and Mr. Westmore said that I really need to sell the crab more, which I definitely agree with.
But I'm not exactly sure what it is about the face that's not really coming together.
I'm thinking crabs have these really long antenna.
So that gives me an idea to put antenna coming off the side of the face, and have them hang down.
That's very old-school monster.
- It's got antenna.
- Yeah.
I get my face sculpt done, and I'm going to start getting this thing molded.
I just need to finish the face today,
'cause it needs to match up with the cowl so it looks like one cohesive head.
Ten minutes.
One thing that's sort of looming over me still is how I'm gonna make these hands and these claws.
Otherwise, it's not gonna read as sloth, and it won't read as a giant monster.
Hey, guys, it's time.
The other thing that's looming over my head is the amount of hair work that I'm gonna have to do.
It's gonna be sort of a daunting task to get all of these things finished on day two.
Whoo-hoo!
So, it's day two of our giant-monster challenge, and we have nine and a half hours in the lab.
This thing is, like, barely cooked.
My chest piece isn't completely cured.
I'm squishing the beak, and it's just... my fingerprints are staying in the foam.
It's totally distorting what I sculpted, and it's pretty much ruined.
I need to figure out something else to do.
Ew.
It's creepy.
I have a very long list of things to do today.
I need to finish my cowl.
I started sculpting a butt for the insect that I need to get finished and molded.
Then I need to, like, fabricate some wings and some legs and a bunch of blender pieces, so I have a lot to do.
My chest piece is so thick, it didn't get baked.
Weird.
Since my chest piece wasn't baked all the way through,
I'm gonna run the chest mold with polyfoam.
But polyfoam's a lot more rigid, so I'm pretty sure it's not gonna come out as nice as I would like it to.
But I have to get something.
I pop open my face mold, clean the clay out.
It looks great.
Now it's time to jump on the cowl.
I decide to put some more spikes on it and detail it out a little bit.
I'm feeling a lot better this morning.
I'm ready, I have a direction, and I'm running at it.
- Ew. Look at his little ears.
- Aren't they gross?
They're really gross.
I have to get the cowl sculpture completely finished, and then
I have to get it molded.
I'm not the fastest mold maker in the world.
So I know that that's gonna take up a chunk of time in my day, and I still have to get these sloth gloves made.
It's a ton of work, and in a challenge this far along in the competition, you have to do every step of the process justice and give it the attention that it deserves, or else it can bite you.
It's time to start on the creature suit, and I'm designing as I'm putting pieces on.
I just grab some couch foam, and I wrap it in a shape that creates my understructure, and from there, I'm going to cut out segments of L200 and actually layer them on top of each other.
I just keep layering them and standing back and looking at it.
There's no time to waste.
I'm just going.
The arms I'm fabricating are gonna extend my model's arms almost two feet, so I want them to be very long and creepy.
It's just gonna add the giant factor to her.
So I decide to take some foam and roll it up into a cone shape.
I want to add as much texture as I can,
'cause I don't want it to just look like a piece of rolled-up foam, because praying mantises have tons of little, like, spikes at the end of their arms.
So I'm cutting spiky shapes out of foam, gluing them on.
Then I make a piping bag out of some wax paper I find in the lab and add silicone.
Piping bags are used in cake decorating to pipe frosting onto cakes, so I feel like
I'm back at the bakery.
I have to fabricate two gloves, get them painted, then get hair laid all over them before the end of the day.
- You like?
- Yeah, it looks cool.
Yeah, I got to get the hair on there.
I'm doing hair because he is a sloth, and they are hairy creatures.
But it has to be really well done, or else it's not gonna do my makeup justice and I'm not gonna make it to the finale.
I need to get this whole bodysuit fabricated in... way less time than I need.
I'm realizing that I bit off way more than I can chew.
Every new thing that I put on this suit just kills me inside.
I don't really want to be in this position this far into the competition.
This isn't the type of work
I want to represent myself with.
I'm not all that proud of this makeup, and it's gonna suck if I go home.
So it's day two of our giant-monster challenge.
And I realize that I bit off way more than I can chew.
Fuck!
So, at this point, I just start throwing paint at it.
I'm hoping that my paint work and some of my finishing work can pull it all together, but it's starting to worry me.
So, down to, like,
30 minutes left in the day,
I get enough hair laid on the first glove that I have to move on to the second one, and I just don't have time to do that.
I make a snap decision, instead of doing fur on both sides,
I'm gonna incorporate a burn makeup on the other side.
It will add another layer of information to the character so that it becomes a little bit more interesting.
So I mix up some gelatin and then start laying that on the other glove.
The way that I'll work this into the story is the armed forces are shooting fire at him.
I'm really happy with how the paint job is coming out.
The stomach's looking really creepy.
So I'm starting to think that I'm going in the right direction.
Hopefully, everything will come together in application.
- That's fucking crazy, dude.
- I did all of this today.
You're completely insane.
- All right, that's time!
- Whoo.
Even with implementing this burn makeup,
I feel like, at this point, this makeup is gonna turn out to be silly.
It's a giant sloth monster.
- How do you feel?
- Like a zombie.
It may or may not work, and that worries me.
We get back to the house, and we're all exhausted.
This was a crazy challenge.
Dead.
Nobody has any energy at all.
I think we're all a little worried.
Only three of us are gonna be in the finale.
And so this is a really important challenge, and it's really weighing on us.
Oh, man.
Did everyone finish everything they wanted to?
- Not even close.
- No.
At the end of the day, there's gonna be one person that's gonna be sent home, and it's nerve-racking.
Let's eat, kids.
Okay.
It's application day.
We have four hours in the lab and one hour at last looks.
Foam come out?
It's pretty good... a few bubbles.
Mine came out really, really nice.
Ew!
What the fuck?
My foam piece has a lot of microbubbling on the cowl.
Hooray for the worst foam in the world.
I have to figure out a way to make these work, which sucks.
Seriously?
- How are you?
- Great!
- Hey, man.
- Good to see you.
Whoop!
Oh, no!
I'm trying to, like, work as fast as possible, but the bald cap is just not working out.
Oh, crap. Okay. So I guess we have to take it off.
I'm freaking out.
I don't have a lot of time.
So I just run and get a cap, and I throw it on her.
Hopefully, it'll be okay.
Yeah, that's better.
The foam's sort of rough this time.
I realize that the microbubbling is on the burn-makeup side.
It's gonna be covered up anyway, so that's not that troubling.
But I'm worried because all aspects of this makeup have to be perfect because this is the last chance to show the judges that I have what it takes to be in the finale.
The first thing I need to do is hose down my bodysuit with crystal clear, which is an acrylic that will make it a little bit glossy.
See if we can get you into that shirt.
Now I need to get my actor in the top half of my bodysuit.
And that's a pretty big challenge.
- Are you in the sleeves sort of?
- Kind of.
It doesn't want to bend.
It's like wrestling, trying to get him into this suit.
Here, bend forward.
There you go.
I hear people laughing.
There you go.
And for a second,
I'm relieved of all this pressure and stress
- from the finale.
- It's so ridiculous.
But only for a second.
So all my pieces are applied and steamed.
Now it's time to start painting, which is my favorite part,
'cause painting it brings it to life.
I want the face to be very gorilla, but with accents of the crustacean.
So I base the face out in light flesh tone, and over the top of that,
I start stippling different alcohol colors, like reds, whites, yellows, browns to do the break-up and make it look like realistic skin rather than a foam piece.
They brought me in for questioning?
I'm 3,000 feet tall.
I need to make these eyes look like bug eyes, so I cut a square of mesh, and I place it over the eyeballs, and I airbrush right over it, and it's gonna give the illusion of praying mantis eyes.
I keep looking at the hair glove and how terrible the hair looks.
I want you to start tearing the fur off of that glove.
Get all of it off of there.
That way,
Lois won't bitch me out about terrible hair work again.
I make a decision to carry this burn makeup onto both arms, because it's gonna save me from having to put horrible hair work onstage in this really, really crucial challenge.
Oh, come on.
15 minutes, guys.
- That's time, guys!
- All right.
It's my last chance to show the judges that I have what it takes to make it to the finale.
High five.
I'm looking at my makeup, and the decision to lose the hair could either win this for me, or it could sink me.
Coming up...
I'm not gonna make it to the finale.
I'm really worried about the tentacles.
Everything's so well executed.
He just bit off more than he could chew.
I really like this character.
We have one hour in last looks, and I'm just doing whatever I can to get this character done.
So I'm just painting like crazy.
I'm so close at this point, if I don't make it,
I would be incredibly disappointed.
Is it okay if I give some of this stuff over this edge here so it doesn't look like shit?
I'm moving lightning fast.
I get the black burns all glued down, and I finish the burn makeup with some K-Y jelly, which makes it look like the burns have started to ooze a little bit.
This makeup has to be spot-on, or else I'm not gonna make it to the finale.
You can hunch the shoulders forward.
Can you pull them up?
I need to get the pants on and get all the pieces to the body blended together.
You look like squid Elvis.
But everything from the neck down looks hokey.
So the main thing I'm worried about is the tentacles.
The problem is there's this giant cowl piece and these hanging antenna that are gonna have to come through the suit.
So I have to reach in there and guide the cowl through.
Then all of a sudden, the suit pops on.
Ta-da!
And I'm thinking,
"This is awesome.
He's a giant monster."
Keep your eye closed for a second.
15 minutes, guys.
All right, that's time!
Thanks, dude.
- Give me some claw.
- Yeah.
At this point,
I'm hoping that somebody else messes up worse than I have.
Welcome to the Face Off reveal stage.
Tonight one of you will be eliminated, and three of you will earn your place in the finale to compete for the VIP trip from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up to one of their
85 international locations, a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500, and $100,000.
First, let's say hello to our talented judges... owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hi, guys.
All:
Hi, Glenn.
Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell.
- Good luck, all of you.
- Thanks, Lois.
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.
Hello, guys and lady.
Hi, Neville.
And joining us again tonight is Emmy-nominated actor
Clifton Collins, Jr.
How you guys doing?
Welcome back, Clifton.
You ready to see some monsters?
Yeah.
All right, guys, this week your spotlight challenge was to use a dramatic newspaper headline and imagery as inspiration for your very own giant monster.
So, with only three finale spots on the line, let's take a look at your monsters.
I am proud of this makeup, and I'm thinking this could get me into the finale.
There's a giant monster standing in front of me.
Even if the judges hate it,
I'm happy, because I got to make a giant monster.
My squid walks out onstage, and I think he fits the challenge, but I know that it's not my best work.
I'm starting to get nervous.
If the judges don't like the way that I've approached the burn makeups, then I'm gonna be really screwed.
Judges, why don't you take a closer look at our monsters?
The coloring is lovely.
I like the teeth and the patterning on the eyes.
It's just one of the few times that an eyehole does not really feel like an eye hole.
- Yeah.
- I love the incorporation
- of the mantis's camouflage.
- Yeah.
- It's really beautiful.
- Thank you.
From the front, it's a unique, interesting Yeti-type face.
It's from the side that you really see the crab.
- It's a good shape.
- Yeah.
The fact that he was able to do all this is fascinating and intriguing to me.
He doesn't look happy, does he?
These things were, in Japanese cinema around the '60s, very hokey.
I think he was going for that feel.
I like the nostalgia of the old Japanese,
'60s throwback.
Can you turn around for us?
- It's not a bad side view.
- Yeah.
You never know what the judges are gonna like or what they're gonna hate.
And we're so close to the finale.
It freaks me out just thinking about it.
Which three artists do you think will make it to the finale?
Tell us on Twitter, using #FaceOff.
I kind of like the transition into the mouth and then down to the shoulder.
That's an interesting idea.
I'm not feeling great, but I'm hoping that the judges at least like how I did the cowl.
Thank you.
I like that he just went right...
"I've got a sloth head, sloth hands."
Then the rest he just made up just to keep moving.
It's a good sculpt.
Sloths are silly-looking characters and cute.
There's no getting around it.
- He's very appealing, isn't he?
- Yeah.
I think there's some really nice paint textures going on here... simple, quick, but broken up.
Thank you.
The judges would now like to speak with each of you to learn more about your work.
Drew, you're up.
Drew, tell us about your giant-sloth character.
He was brought to the mainland as a zoo attraction, sort of like King Kong, and he broke loose and started destroying and going crazy on downtown Shanghai.
They tried to fight him off with flamethrowers, and his arms caught fire, so that's why the burns traveled up his arms and on to the sides of his head and to his chest as well.
You've created something that feels successful within this challenge.
I love the combination of techniques, both in your painting approach and the overall fabrication.
I just think you could have handled the burn
- with greater finesse.
- Thank you.
I really like this character,
I have to say.
It was a wise decision to go for the hands and the head.
I think it's a very successful makeup this week.
I don't get the sense that you've modified the physicality to accommodate gigantism.
But the way the sculpture and the design sustains the character is what's really beautiful about this.
Thank you.
The sloth face is just so real-looking.
- I love where your head's at.
- Thank you very much.
- Drew, please step back.
- Thanks, Alex.
Cig.
So what can you tell us about the Yeti crab?
He was a mutant byproduct of the Chernobyl disaster, and the Russians discovered him, but he couldn't be controlled, and he busted out, and he starts crashing through Russia.
There are some elements within this that are absolutely lovely, particularly the face.
Could you turn sideways?
Thank you.
When we see him in profile,
I think it works exceptionally well.
- Well done.
- Thank you.
There are some great forms in that face.
Where I struggle with this is I don't see much of the crab aesthetic happening.
That feels more like a bumblebee, and that is a subjective thing, so don't take that too much to heart.
I totally get what you're saying.
I love what's going on.
I love the shadows, and I really like the mix of fur and shell on the back.
- You did a pretty sweet job.
- Thank you.
Cig, you can step back.
Thanks, guys.
George.
George, tell us about your giant creature.
He's based in the city of Dubai, which is kind of known for their excess.
So they had the biggest zoo in the world, where all the animals were genetic experiments, and this guy was the biggest, and he broke out and then went on a rampage in Dubai.
Where I think you've really succeeded is particularly in profile with the head.
That's the George that we've come to know,
'cause you're a pretty fantastic sculptor
- and technician.
- Thank you.
The color work makes it feel a little playful
- and less of a threat.
- Mm-hmm.
It takes me back to my childhood.
I remember the squid monsters and big giant robot and things like that.
- So thank you.
- Thanks.
I'm heavily approving of the sarlacc pit of the stomach that you built.
Like, it's a really great idea.
I appreciate your enthusiasm and that you were swinging for the fences.
Thank you.
George, please step down.
Dina, you're up.
Please step forward.
Hey, Dina. You want to tell me a little bit about mantis?
She is a praying mantis who really had a taste for the heads of her mates, so she ate tons of them, and to satisfy her hunger, she worked her way up the food chain to the big city, where there are thousands of men for her to feast on.
Really blown away at the detail.
The head's really beautiful and the detail in the eyes,
I love just looking at her.
Good job.
Thank you.
I really do love the model's eyeholes.
Feels completely part of the head.
- My goodness, I really like it.
- Thank you so much.
Everything is so fitting and so well executed.
Every square inch has been addressed in some way.
- I love it.
- Thank you.
Dina, please step back.
Good job.
All right, guys, the judges have heard what you have to say.
If you please head back to the makeup room while they decide who will move on to the finale.
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.
All right, so the question at hand is, whose monster helps secure them a spot in the finale?
So why don't we start with Drew's sloth.
I feel like he spent all his time on the head.
The expertise really showed.
I mean, the head was almost close to perfect.
The problem is he gave us a really nice sloth head and some really nice sloth claws, and then not-so-good burn makeup.
I do think the burn makeup is disappointing.
It could have been more proficiently expressed.
Absolutely.
So I'm on a fence about Drew, honestly.
All right, let's move on to Cig's Yeti crab.
He chose to do a literalized "Yeti meets crab."
I happen to not like that look.
But it not only feels like a Japanese giant monster, it actually feels Japanese in its design.
So, for this challenge,
I love it.
The thing that I really enjoyed was that samurai look, particularly around the face.
The guy's just so at home.
He clearly loves
Japanese monster movies.
All right, let's move on to George's squid.
The form language on the head is a standout on the makeup.
You can see the elegance that George possesses.
I'm very fond of it.
He looks as if he's a plaything from Doctor Who.
And there's something so delightful about it that I've sort of forgiven the fact that it isn't well executed.
He just bit off more than he could chew because he wanted it to be amazing and big.
When he chose to tackle the eight tentacles,
I think he just went south really fast.
All right, let's move on to Dina's praying mantis.
The most impressive thing is the fact that every square inch of this character has been addressed.
Yeah, that color, the shape, the sculpt through here...
I mean, it's lovely work.
And think about the actual surface area that she had to paint.
- The painting's beautiful.
- Yeah!
I mean, granted, it could have done with maybe a little bit more variation in color.
But that is really just a bonus.
All right, judges, so have you decided who should move on to the finale?
- I think we have.
- Excellent.
Well, Clifton, thank you so much for being here with us tonight and helping us select our finalist.
Thanks for having me.
I had a blast.
All right, well, let's bring them back out and award some finale spots.
I just like the fire.
There's fire!
We walk out onstage, and there's swords and torches.
I don't know what's going on.
Oh, God.
Welcome back.
As you can see,
I've done a bit of redecorating.
- It's lovely.
- Now, the things you see around you are related to our finale challenge.
Before I can tell you more, you need to earn your spot.
So let's find out who is moving forward.
Glenn, who is the winner of this challenge and the first person to make it to the finale?
The first person joining us in the finale is...
All right, Glenn, who is the winner of this challenge and the first person to make it to the finale?
The winner of tonight's challenge and the first person joining us in the finale is...
Dina.
Yes!
Yes!
Thank you.
We would have been happy with your mantis if two people would have worked on it.
So the amount of success that you achieved by yourself is all the more impressive.
Thank you so much.
Aah!
Holy crap.
Me?
The first week I was here,
I didn't think I measured up to anyone, so this feels so amazing.
- Dina, congratulations.
- Thank you.
You've earned the first spot in the finale.
Yes!
Thank you.
All right, Glenn, who is the next person to make it to the finale?
The second person that will be joining us in the finale is...
Cig.
Whoo!
We loved the throwback nature of your concept, especially in profile.
The striated edges were a really great way to show off the crab aspect.
Thank you guys so much.
I honestly didn't think
I was gonna make it this far, and now I'm in the finale.
Like, this is amazing.
Congratulations, Cig.
You've earned the second spot in our finale.
All right, we have two artists left and only one spot.
So, Glenn, who has the final spot in our finale?
Here I am, almost at the end.
I can see that $100,000.
Being eliminated right before the finale would be devastating.
I want to be a finalist, and
I think I deserve to be there.
The last person moving on to the finale is...
Drew.
- Drew.
- Oh, my God.
Thanks, George.
You made a very smart decision to focus on the sloth elements of your character, which gave you the time to deliver a very successful sculpture
- and a beautiful paint job.
- Thank you.
Congratulations, Drew.
You've earned the last spot in the finale.
Thank you so much, guys.
I'm dumbstruck.
Being a finalist is beyond what I'd ever hoped for, and I'm so happy and so grateful to have this opportunity.
Unfortunately, that means, George, you have been eliminated.
George, you can't get too down on yourself for making it this far.
You have delivered some amazing makeups this season.
Unfortunately, this week you just weren't up to the work
- of your peers.
- Yes.
George, it's been so great having you here with us.
But if you would please head back to the makeup room and pack up your kit.
Thanks, guys.
Good luck, George.
I'm out!
I'm pretty disappointed, but I've done some work that I'm really proud of.
I got to make 13 monsters.
That's really cool.
I love doing this stuff so much.
So I'm gonna go back to my house, finish building my shop, and keep making monsters.
Only one challenge remains between one of you and our grand prize.
Oh, God.
We will end the season the way we began... with life and death.
And I've got several surprises in store for you.
Oh, my God.
Without a pause for a breath we're going straight into the finale.
Shit!
Oh, God.

When I was a little girl...
...my mother would remind me each night to open up my heart to God...
...for he was kind, merciful and just.
Things changed when my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise...
...me and my brothers in a little place on the edge of the Mojave Desert.
She never talked of a kind and merciful God again.
Instead, she spoke of a prophecy...
...of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness...
...and the fate of mankind would be decided.
I finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed...
...why he was so mad at his children.
"I don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me.
"I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit."
Respond to an MVA on the on-ramp of 10 East.
- You're the idiot!
- Goddamn animals.
Nights like this，
I'd like to take a match to this city...
...just so I could watch all these motherfuckers burn.
Just a good-old-boy barbecue， huh?
A fresh start.
That's what this place needs.
Jesus.
Shit!
What the fuck?
Stop! Drop the bag.
Put your hands on your head.
Man down! I repeat, man down!
It's started.
There isn't much time.
Shut the fuck up and drop the bags now!
Hands on your head.
On your head!
Turn around! Turn the fuck around!
Don't! Let him go!
Take the shot, Burton.
Let him the fuck g...
What the...?
Burton!
What are you doing, Michael?
- These weren't your orders.
- What are you saying?
No， I'm following my own orders now.
Then you will die along with the child.
Burton， you fucking know this guy?
What the hell are you...?
You okay, Jeep?
Sorry I woke you, Charlie.
No. It wasn't you.
He's been kicking up a storm all night.
He must know something I don't.
Another bad dream?
It's just stress, Jeep. That's all.
I mean, you do too much worrying.
About this place, about your dad.
About me.
You're the only thing
I like to worry about.
See what I mean?
You're worried about a girl that's eight months pregnant. Isn't even your baby.
It's enough to give anybody nightmares.
Go ahead and make fun of me.
Everybody else does.
Come on.
You know how much I appreciate everything you and Bob do for me.
About a month from now, this baby's gonna have a new family.
I'm gonna have to start thinking about what the hell I'm gonna do with my life.
So you're still going through with it?
I'm not ready to be a mama.
Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is.
Well, I could help you.
I mean, we could do it together, you know?
I want to.
You gotta stop carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders, Jeep.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel, Second Class.
I don't know whether I like it, being seen with an angel without any wings.
Oh, I've got to earn them.
And you'll help me, won't you?
Sure, sure.
Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days, that thing's gonna hit you back.
What are you talking about, Percy?
We got a special relationship here.
Yeah, they got names for that kind of relationship.
It's disgusting.
You're right. It is disgusting.
Really, how can she go out in public looking like that?
I don't know.
Why don't we just ask her?
No， Howard, don't.
You'll embarrass me.
Audrey, your mother was wondering if you got dressed this morning...
...with the specific intention of showing your ass off to the entire world.
Yeah, because I woke up hoping to get double-teamed...
...by a couple of meth-head truckers in some bathroom of a desert shithole.
It's a good thing we got stuck here.
I feel satisfied with that answer.
I really do.
I'm being punished for something，
I know it.
Shit.
"Next service in 50 miles"?
Fifty miles?
Merry Christmas.
What's so merry about it?
You know， that shit ain't really good for the baby.
Guess I should think about quitting, then.
Before you quit, could I get one from you?
You can buy a whole pack inside.
How about I get one from you...
...and give you two from the pack you're gonna sell me in there?
You know what? I'm kind of lost.
- Am I right here?
- Not even close.
Son of a bitch.
Well, are there any phones around here that actually work?
Bob will probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him nice.
Maybe pay him a little something.
I think I can handle that.
They got anything in there to eat?
Pancakes or...
Yep. Got a buttermilk stack for $3.75.
French toast for $4 if you're into that.
Personally， I like the pancakes， though.
- You okay， Charlie?
- Yeah.
I'm fine. This guy's just lost.
Who is that?
- This is what happens when you drive.
- What? What do you want me to do?
Talk to him.
It was supposed to be ready two goddamn hours ago.
It hasn't been two hours.
Hope Salem Lights are all right.
That's all we got.
Charlie, where you been?
It's not a resort.
We got orders stacking up.
And you best not be smoking again.
A girl in your condition.
Bob, you see where I'm at right now?
Can my condition really get any worse?
Besides, you ain't one to talk.
What? I quit two years ago.
Yeah? So why are you still carrying that fancy lighter around for, then?
It's a gift from my ex-wife.
I'm sentimental.
I wanna remember how much I hate her guts.
Hey, man, you got a phone
I can use?
My cell phone ain't got no reception.
The phone booth outside is busted.
Excuse me. Is there any news about when our car might be fixed?
You said your boy would have us on the road two hours ago.
At the rate we're going, we'd be lucky to make it to Scottsdale by Christmas.
Hey.
The hood's up on this Beemer.
Does that mean anything to you?
Yeah.
What are you working on that's so important you're not doing your job?
Nothing.
I found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage shed.
I know how you never like to throw anything away, so...
- What are you doing?
- What?
Look, Jeep, I like Charlie. I do.
And I think it's real nice, you giving her a helping hand...
- Leave me alone.
- She's not your responsibility.
Hey.
Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you.
How long you gonna follow her around like a puppy looking for hind tit?
You're gonna clean up her mess while she steps out with every other guy?
Don't say that about her!
She's not like that.
Look...
...I know it doesn't make much sense to you.
Sometimes it doesn't make sense to me, either.
I've been having these dreams about her.
Some of them so bad...
...I wish I never had to sleep again.
I can't explain it, Dad.
I just feel like it's something
I gotta do.
You know， your mother...
...thought I was crazy for wanting to buy this place...
...moving us all the way up here, middle of nowhere.
But I just knew it was something
I had to do.
I couldn't explain it, either, just like you.
I told your mother,
"Trust me. You just wait and see.
When they build that big old mall on 9 with all them superstores...
...like they been planning for years, this place is gonna be a gold mine."
The only problem was, I was wrong.
They went and built the whole thing there in Mesa County...
...and I look pretty damn stupid.
And I see you making the same damn mistake I made...
...believing in something that's never gonna happen.
Now, you listen to me， son.
It's time for you to leave here.
I don't wanna see you wake up one day all old and pissed off...
...realizing you're lost.
Just like everybody else that stops here.
Now, go on. Fix that car. I want these people out of here by nightfall.
He's about this close to wrapping it up.
What is wrong with you today?
I told you to get the satellite TV, but you didn't wanna listen.
- What the hell do I need that crap for?
- The History Channel， man.
I got all the history I can take.
- That's for sure.
- What's your beef now?
You don't need to be watching this, anyway.
All right, baby. Come on, this is gonna be it right here. Come on.
Clear as day.
What the hell's that?
It's one of them test things.
Yeah, that don't look like a test.
Hey, man, I need to use the phone.
In the back, past the kitchen.
Excuse me, but if this were an actual emergency...
...wouldn't they be giving us instructions on what to do?
Why don't you check out that old radio, see if there's any news about the TV?
Eleven a.m. Tomorrow at the courthouse, I know. I'll be there.
Put my little man on the phone.
Because a father's supposed to be able to talk to his son. That's why.
I don't care what your lawyer said.
I got my own lawyer.
Now, put him on the goddamn phone.
Hello?
Your phone is breaking up.
Do you hear me? Hello? Hello?
Shit.
Maybe there was an earthquake.
- A lot of people could be hurt.
- Not if it was centered in the desert.
Exactly. Could be nothing to worry about.
- So then why is the TV out?
- Well, maybe it was terrorists.
Oh, God.
For crying out loud， there's no use speculating.
I'll just call my brother up.
He'll probably know something.
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean?
I was just on the phone. The shit cut off in the middle of my conversation.
I want my money back.
- This is perfect. Absolutely perfect.
- Calm down.
Hey, hey, hey.
Everybody, simmer down.
Nothing to get excited about.
They're probably working on the lines.
Besides, Jeep's gonna have your car fixed up quick.
- Then you're gonna be on your way.
- Good.
Have a seat wherever you want, ma'am. Specials are on the board.
I already know what I want.
- Okay. What'll it be?
- I'll have a steak, please.
- How'd you like that cooked?
- Rare， if you would.
- And water and no ice.
- Coming right up.
- "Charlie，" is it?
- Yeah.
What an unusual name for a girl.
So they say.
Be right back with your water.
Hello. I'm Gladys， Gladys Foster.
Oh, hello， Gladys.
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm Sandra and this is my husband， Howard.
What a nice-looking young couple.
- What brings you up to these parts?
- We are on our way to Scottsdale.
But our car broke down， and we're stuck here while it's getting fixed.
What a nuisance.
Say, Gladys, you know, the lines seem to be down around here.
The phone and the TV.
And I was just wondering if you...
...might have heard something on your way up about what's going on.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that, sweetheart. It'll all be over soon.
Oh, okay.
Excuse me.
Hey. So, what are we looking at?
I don't know. There's probably something wrong with the computer...
...but we don't have the gear to test it.
- Oh, shit.
They're gonna be pissed.
Tell them we'll call and have it towed to one of those dealerships in Harding.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
The phone's out.
- What?
- Yeah.
Oh, thank you, dear.
How far along are you?
Oh, just about there.
- The father must be very proud.
- I wouldn't know.
- He's...
- Out of sight, out of mind.
I see.
So I take it you're not married?
- No.
- That's too bad.
No. I prefer it that way. I don't need a man telling me what to do.
- But what about the baby?
- I got it under control.
But it's gonna burn.
What'd you just say?
I said, your fucking baby's gonna burn.
Go to hell, lady.
- Fucking Jesus freak.
- What happened?
All those little babies are gonna burn.
- Gladys.
- Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt.
All you do is complain, complain, complain.
What?
- What? What?
- No, Howard.
- What did you just say?
- No, no, don't.
I don't know who you think you are， but I'd like you to apologize to my wife.
- Howard!
- Oh, my...
Shit.
You're all gonna fucking die.
No.
What the fuck, man?
Shoot her， Jeep!
You will never save her.
Shoot the bitch!
Shoot her!
No， no!
Somebody help me! Somebody...
Put pressure on it!
Don't look at me like that...
...or your husband will bleed to death.
Keep pressure right there. Calm down.
Keep pressure on his neck.
Who the fuck is this old lady?
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Charlie.
Charlie, call 911!
Keep your eyes on the old lady, man.
- Help him.
- All right， calm down.
- Help him.
- Audrey.
Careful with him.
- Easy.
- He'll be okay?
Howard! Breathe. Just breathe.
- How far is it to the hospital?
- Mom， how did she do that?
- I don't know!
- Seventy, maybe 80 miles.
- What?
- Eighty mil...?
I'm gonna get there as soon as we can， but I can't stay.
- That's fine! Please drive faster!
- Okay.
Oh, God, please go faster.
What the hell is that?
They're clouds!
What do you think they are?
They're not clouds. Clouds don't buzz!
Oh, my God.
I can't believe she was still standing after Percy hit her with that frying pan.
He broke her fucking neck.
I saw it. I swear I saw it.
Did you see the gun that guy had?
What's a guy do with a gun like that?
Hey, Jeep. It's all right, son.
I couldn't pull the trigger.
I froze.
I saw what I needed to do.
I was too afraid.
She would have killed you.
She would have killed Charlie.
Hey.
You ain't got nothing to be ashamed of. You hear me, son?
Not everybody can play the hero.
Especially when it comes to pulling the trigger.
What happened? What happened?
- What's going on?
- I gotta get my Bible.
- What for?
- Somebody's gotta start praying.
Jesus, she's burning up.
How is that possible?
She's been dead for an hour.
I don't give a fuck how long she's been dead. Bitch just walked on the ceiling.
She ain't staying in here.
The old bitch is heavy.
Hold her up, Jeep!
- I'm trying.
- Where are the flies?
How am I supposed to know?
Are you asking me to explain the behavior of a motherfucking pestilence?
Hey. Somebody's coming.
Now what?
- All right. Now we're talking.
- Wait a second. L.A.P. D?
- I'm from Vegas, man.
- Give me the gun.
Oh, thank God.
Charlie, wait!
Take one more step and I'II drop you right there.
Is that how you greet all your customers?
Mister, after what we've been through...
...you're lucky we don't shoot you first and greet you later.
Now, let me see them teeth.
Your teeth， goddamn it!
Let me see them!
No shark teeth, Pop.
Okay, then.
- How about you tell us your name?
- Michael.
I'm sorry about that， Michael.
We had this old lady in here who went crazy in my place.
She had these teeth.
Never seen anything like it.
Practically bit a man in half.
What are you doing out here, anyway?
You don't look like any policeman I ever saw.
Even one from L.A.
But he's gotta be, right?
I mean, who the hell would be crazy enough to steal a cop car?
You don't know, do you?
Don't know what?
We don't know anything. Nothing works. The TV， the radio, the phone.
- I'm running out of time.
- Now, you just hold on there， fella.
You better start talking, or you just get the hell out of here.
Hold on.
Dad, just tell him you're sorry.
Hey, hey, hey, son.
Son, now, I'm sure you don't wanna go spilling blood for no good reason...
...in front of all these decent people now.
Now, what do you say about just letting Bob go?
Then you can be on your way， nice and easy.
They're here.
You're gonna need this.
- Wait, who's here?
- More like her.
What do you mean， like her?
Hold on.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Dad, I can handle it.
He can handle it.
He doesn't have a choice.
Don't do anything brave.
- What's happening?
- You better get back inside.
Come on, Jeep.
Jeep, come on!
Everybody stay calm.
Okay, we're locked in here, so what the fuck we doing now?
All right, Rambo， you got us up here.
You mind telling us what we're fighting?
Listen. Listen.
You hear what I'm hearing?
- What the hell is that?
- It sounds almost like...
Ice cream?
It can't be fucking serious， right?
There's a safety switch on the side.
You won't be needing it.
Push it all the way down two clicks.
Now, when this starts, you hold on tight.
Otherwise, you're gonna blow your hand off.
What the fuck are y'all looking at me for?
- Audrey.
- Yeah.
Honey, listen.
It's the ice-cream man.
Oh, man, he don't look that bad.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh， shit.
Oh, shit!
Get ready.
Is that it?
Now! Shoot now!
- They're just regular people!
- Not anymore. Keep firing.
Don't let them get near the windows!
Where is he?
Mom, open your eyes!
- I can't!
- You have to open your eyes!
- I can't!
- Yes!
- See what you made me do， Mother?
- No!
No!
Hold on to him.
- Dad!
- Hold him. Hold him. Grab him.
Charlie!
There you are.
Dad! Oh, my God!
We got them running.
We got them running!
- No.
- No, he's out there. He's alive.
- He's out there. He's out there.
- He's gone.
He's gone.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks.
I told you not to do anything brave.
We got them running.
- What happened?
- Someone needs to be on the roof.
- I'll go.
- Hold on.
You better start talking.
The last time God lost faith in man...
...he sent a flood.
This time, he sent what you see outside.
Are you saying this is the Apocalypse?
I'm saying this is an extermination.
Those things outside are just vessels.
They're possessed.
The weakest willed are the easiest to turn.
Possessed by what? Demons?
No.
By angels.
No， no， wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, son.
I don't know what book you've been reading...
...but in my version, the angels are the good guys.
Well, the truth, I'm afraid, is never that simple.
Bullshit. I'm not a pastor， but I've never heard of no ice-cream man...
...or old lady eating raw meat, jumping on the ceiling with baby teeth...
...so I don't know what you talking about.
Hold on. How do you know so much about them?
Because until last night，
I was on their side.
- So you're saying...
- Yeah， that's right.
Yesterday I was fucking Santa Claus.
I mean, you know this is crazy, right?
I mean, I don't even believe in God.
Well, that's just fine, Bob.
He doesn't believe in you, either.
He doesn't believe in any of this anymore.
I knew this day was coming. I just didn't think I'd be around to see it.
Come on, Percy. What are we even talking about this for?
Angels and possessed people?
It's not real! It's...
Have you looked outside， Bob?
I mean, those people aren't exactly our regular customers.
Wait, so are you here to protect us?
No， not you.
Her.
Me? Why me?
Because your child is the only hope humanity has of surviving.
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
This can't be happening to me.
I mean, I'm nobody. I'm just a waitress.
- I don't even own a car.
- None of that matters anymore.
Either your child lives or mankind dies.
So we supposed to hold those things off till the baby gets here?
- That's it.
- I'm only eight months pregnant.
This shit can't be happening, man.
How are we supposed to survive here for a month?
We won't have to.
- It's coming soon, isn't it?
- Yes.
Listen. I simply don't care what you people believe.
And those things outside, they don't care， either.
They just want the child dead.
Now, this first attack was a test of our strength.
The next will be a test of our weakness.
Now, we can sit here and discuss it, or you can try and help me.
But believe me, something much worse is on the way.
Sons of bitches.
They're out there. I can feel them.
So, what's with that gun?
What?
Your piece, the one you killed Grandma with.
I don't reckon it's for hunting buck.
I use it for protection.
Protection from what?
- From people.
- People?
Yeah. You know, people that be starting shit.
- Regular people or just, like...
- No.
Not "regular" regular people, but， you know...
Oh, yeah. Irregular people, then.
Fuck out of here， man.
I got my reasons for doing what I do and that's that.
I've never actually used it, all right?
I may have flashed it or whatever and scared a few folks...
...but never actually fired off.
Not until today.
This shit is crazy， man.
When I was a kid...
...my father would sit by my bed every night before I went to sleep.
And he'd say to me:
"Percy...
...if you don't wake up tomorrow...
...if it turns out that...
...today...
...is your last day on Earth...
...would you be proud...
...of what you've done in this life?
Because...
...if you ain't...
...you better start getting square."
Fuck it.
On the house.
Thank you.
You hungry?
No.
Hell， just because it's the end of the world, doesn't mean you gotta starve.
I'm just happy they still have the gas on.
I never really cared much for beer.
Howard was the beer drinker in the family.
So, what did you do?
You know， before you came here?
I was a soldier.
I was a general in his army.
Well, what changed?
What made you leave?
I was given an order
I didn't believe in.
He lost faith.
I didn't.
Well, how come you still have faith?
I mean, it seems like everything I have faith in...
...causes me nothing but trouble.
When God chose your kind...
...as the object of his love...
...I was the first in all heaven to bow down before you.
My love...
...my hope for mankind， was no less than his.
But I have watched you trample that gift.
I've watched you kill each other over race and greed...
...waging war over dust and rubble and the words in old books.
And yet, in the midst of all this darkness...
...I see some people who will not be bowed.
I see some people who will not give up...
...even when they know all hope is lost.
Some people...
...who realize that being lost is so close to being found.
I see you, Jeep.
Fifteen years old, your mother leaves.
Your father withdraws from the world.
You spend the next five years of your young life...
...helping him find his way home.
You love a woman who bears the child of another...
...and you love her with no thought of yourself...
...even though you know she may never love you the way you love her.
You, Jeep.
You are the reason I still have faith.
It's almost time for the next shift.
You question him?
I question myself.
And so should you.
Since their creation, he has told us only to love them.
I cannot stop.
They have brought this judgment upon themselves.
They are just lost.
It is our place to guide them.
It is our place to obey.
Tell me， Gabriel, do you wish to be a son...
...who gives his father what he asks for or what he needs?
This is not your test, Michael.
How dare you presume to know his heart?
Because he made this one.
And it tells me he shouldn't lose faith now.
It's too late.
The order has been given.
The weak will turn against the strong and you will undo what has been done.
And if you defy him...
...you'll anger him for the last time.
Only if I fail.
War is coming to man, Michael, whether you wish it or not.
The dogs of heaven will be unleashed.
Sandra.
Howard?
Howard.
Baby, help me.
Howard!
Help me!
Please, someone help me!
- Hey. Hey, what are you doing?
- Let me go.
- No.
- He's alive! Let me go!
Mom. Mom, what are you doing?
- Mom， stop!
- He's alive.
- He's not.
- Your father is alive.
Let go of me!
No， don't!
Come back! Come back!
Come back!
Howard!
- Howard!
- Mom. Mom, get down!
Percy?
It's my fault.
I fell asleep.
- Dad.
- Don't.
I did this.
He trusted me...
...and just like your mother,
I let him down.
I let everybody down.
Here. Mom, if you take one of these, you're gonna feel better, okay?
This is your fault.
We were only moving because of you.
We sacrificed everything...
...for you.
No. You... You wanted to go.
- You said that you wanted to.
- I loved my house.
I loved my life, and you have ruined it.
You ruined everything!
- Everything.
- Enough.
You're just gonna sit here and torture your daughter like this?
Can you come help me find a station that actually works?
No Homeland Security.
- No military response.
- Wait.
You guys. Oh， my God,
I'm hearing something.
We're on our own here, people.
If you can hear my voice...
...we're getting the first bits of good news since this Apocalypse...
...began nearly 48 hours ago.
A militia has formed on the outskirts of Las Vegas...
...and begun to engage those affected.
I'm getting unconfirmed reports of other militias gathering...
...in Death Valley, Zion and Red Ridge
National Parks in the Mojave Desert.
Red Ridge. That's only an hour up the road.
- Does that mean we can leave?
- No.
- We're not going anywhere.
- What?
I don't know about you, but I gotta get the fuck out of here.
No.
I won't risk being on the move when the baby comes.
It's too dangerous.
Too dangerous? What the fuck you mean, too dangerous?
May God give us the strength to survive...
...and have mercy for those who are already lost.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You okay?
You know， the crazy thing is，
I didn't even want this baby.
I even went down to the clinic, do you know that?
I remember sitting in the waiting room...
...absolutely sure
I was doing the right thing.
Then I started getting this feeling.
Like I was...
...falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't...
I couldn't breathe. I couldn't speak.
I kept thinking:
"This must be what death feels like."
And when they called my name,
I just ran.
For a long time...
...I pretended I could go back whenever I wanted.
End it like I planned.
But then I'd start getting that damn feeling again...
...and I knew I didn't have a choice.
Somehow I knew this had already been decided.
And it made me just...
It made me hate...
...this thing growing inside of me.
You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie.
It ain't right.
You'll get through this.
I know you will.
Why do you have so much faith in me, Jeep, huh?
God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to.
Or is it that you don't have any other hard-luck cases to follow around?
You know， you're not the only one who's had it hard around here, okay?
So you let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself.
- All you have to do is this.
- No, no, I know.
It's two clicks all the way down.
I dated a Marine last summer.
He was kind of a gun freak.
My parents hated him.
I'll bet they did.
You know， my mom was right.
It is my fault that we're here.
She didn't mean that.
No， she did.
And it's true. The only reason why we were moving was because of me.
They thought that my friends were a bad influence.
But I was the bad influence.
It's just all really fucked up.
You know， when I was a shorty...
...the only time my old man ever gave me attention...
...is when I did something bad.
- So you know what I did, right?
- What?
I got really good at being bad.
The problem is, when you get older...
...and you have a family...
...being bad is not so good anymore.
Hey, is it over?
- Are we back in business?
- No. I don't think so.
- You better get downstairs.
- No. No， I can handle it.
- No, get downstairs.
- No, I can handle it.
Take this just in case.
Get ready.
Stay.
Wait a minute.
Kyle, are they?
Kyle.
It's a trap.
It's a trap! They seen them coming and they turned the lights on!
Hey! Get back in your car!
Get back in your car!
Dad!
They're not gonna make it!
- Get back in your car!
- Back in the car!
Yeah.
Stop!
Stop! You're gonna hit them too!
What the hell is that guy doing?
Don't open the door.
If you do， we all die.
- Please, let me go.
- Come on， I got you.
Now what?
Now what， huh?
Fooled you!
Kyle!
Damn it to hell!
Oh, God. Audrey.
You're gonna die now.
She's just a kid.
You can't just let her die.
I swear, if you don't do something,
I will.
Wait. You stay here.
Open the door.
Come on! Go!
I'll get some water.
- Jeep.
- In here! In here!
Don't be scared.
I just wanna play with your baby.
Stop! Get off of her!
- Are you hurt?
- Where is he? Where is he?
What the hell?
Oh, God.
It's coming.
Wait. Just because I'm a girl does not mean I know how to do this.
- Stay calm and do exactly as I tell you.
- How do you know what to do?
What a way to bring a child into the world.
- What the fuck is that?
- He's coming.
We need to hurry now, Charlie.
This isn't exactly something we can hurry.
I need you to push now. You push like you've never pushed before. Push.
- Michael, who is coming?
- Push!
How many bullets you got left?
Come on. That's it. Good.
Charlie, you did it. Charlie, you...
You did it.
Here's your baby. No， it's okay.
Your baby's fine. Look.
She's all right.
Give her some time.
- Audrey.
- Hi.
Look, Mom, we did it.
The baby's alive.
He's beautiful.
I remember when you were a baby.
You used to look at me just like that.
Just like that.
Audrey, I'm sorry about what I said to you before. I didn't mean it.
I know.
You're the most precious thing in the world to me. You know that.
Yeah.
It's just you and me now.
I know.
Are we safe now?
No.
But now at least the child will have a chance to grow up.
A chance to lead the world out of darkness.
What happens until then?
You need to show him how.
What makes you think
I can do that?
What makes you think
I want to do that?
If he's so important, why don't you take him?
Because this journey is yours.
- Something's happening.
- We need to go.
The possessed can't come near the child...
...but he sent someone who can, someone like me.
- Like you?
- Gabriel.
He's come here to do what I wouldn't.
You were the one that was supposed to kill the baby.
That's the order you didn't obey.
- We need to go.
- What is he talking about?
- Gather up weapons.
- What are you talking about?
- We need to go now. Now!
- Michael, answer me!
The baby.
The baby was never meant to be born.
But the future has been unwritten.
The child lives.
And while he does, there's still hope.
Audrey, the baby.
- Mom!
- Audrey, come.
- What are you doing?
- You heard.
They just want the baby. I'll give them the baby, then they're gonna let us go.
- You give him back to me right now.
- Why?
You didn't even want him in the first place.
Come on, Audrey.
Audrey, come with me!
It's just one baby.
Oh, shit!
Here! Here!
No!
- Don't, Jeep! No!
- Dad!
No! The child.
Get the child out of here.
- What about you?
- Don't be afraid.
Find the prophets.
Learn to read the instructions.
Prophets? What prophets?
What instructions?
Go!
Let's keep moving.
I knew he'd send you, Gabriel.
You were always so eager to please him.
Unlike you...
...the rebellious son.
Your wings.
They would have helped you now.
To not feel their burden is a dream.
Do you think you can defy him...
...and not pay the price?
The child lives.
He lives.
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
Yours is a fool's sacrifice， Michael.
You can help them run, but they won't escape.
Neither will you， my brother.
I'm not running anymore.
It's enough.
There's another way.
There is no other way.
That's enough.
Gabriel, that's enough.
You wanted to live like one of them.
Now you'll die like one of them.
Jeep.
Your arm.
The instructions.
Sorry.
We're out of business.
Hey, guys, we're here.
Okay. We need to figure out our weapon situation.
Hopefully, Michael didn't take everything out of the car. Look around.
I've got a flare gun and a couple of flares.
- Jeep.
- Duck!
Audrey, the flare gun!
Audrey.
Charlie, get down!
Get off of her!
Jeep, do it!
Do it!
Jeep.
- The baby?
- Alive.
Jeep.
Audrey?
Oh, shit.
Give me the child.
No.
Then death will come to you both.
No!
Why do you continue to fight...
...when you know all hope is lost?
Fuck you.
This can't be. You've disobeyed him.
You gave him what he asked for.
I gave him what he needed.
Do it.
Do it!
No.
I would not have shown you such mercy.
I know.
That's why you failed him.
They're waiting.
Where are you going?
You're the true protector.
You always have been.
Will we ever see you again?
Have faith.
When I was a little girl...
...my mother spoke of a prophecy...
...of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness...
...and the fate of mankind would be decided.
One night, I finally got up the courage to ask my mother...
...why God was so mad at his children.
"I don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me.
"I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit."

I hit the Internet cafe.
You know how many e-mails
I had in my box?
Eighty-three.
Oh, you're a popular guy.
Very.
Of course, 60 of 'em were ads trying to get me to buy something.
Sarah, did you leave these tools on the ground?
I might have.
Let's get them in the bag and bring them in the house, please.
We don't want it to rain on them.
Oh, I checked your Facebook page.
What's-his-name wrote on your wall again.
God, I should never have added you.
Yeah, he, um.
Wants to get back together.
Of course he does.
I told you. Princess, he doesn't deserve you.
There you are.
And there you are. Here I am.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, we have a problem.
I've barely been gone an hour. What now?
You'll see.
Great. Do I have to? Yeah.
Hey, I was looking for you.
Did you go into town?
Mmm-mmm. I didn't think so.
Where were you? Outside.
Working very hard on the garden.
Hmm. We have a garden?
I had a headache.
Haven't you heard that one before?
I did!
I know, honey.
Are you all better now?
Yes. Thank you, Uncle Peter.
So, what is the big problem?
All right, all right. This way.
Why can't you just tell me about it?
No, this is something you have to see.
I'll give you a hint.
It's in here.
Funny.
What do you think?
How are you supposed to tell anything from that?
What, do you need binoculars, old man?
Just get your face up there.
Look in there.
Okay. Oh.
That's really... ls this necessary?
I made a hole! What are you...
Are you impressed with your dad?
I'm impressed with your dad.
Now that, little brother, is a hole.
Nicely done.
That is not good.
No, not good.
What is it? Oh, it's mold.
Honey, you know what, I want you to stand back.
This is really bad.
I don't want you breathing it in.
It can make you really sick.
Just looking at it is making me sick.
This whole house could be infected, for all we know.
Affected, not infected.
Affected, infected, whatever.
Well, if you cover it up, who'll ever know, right?
That's true. Just a minute ago we had a tiny hole to deal with.
Now we have a big hole.
Well, the insurance will cover it.
It's obviously part of the leak.
Did you remember to bring the...
Ah, great minds think alike.
So what do you want to do?
Why are you asking me?
We're out of here in a few days.
Oh, okay. See here, this is where it gets tricky.
You're gonna dump this whole thing on me.
But it comes with the perk of you not being here.
So, dare I complain?
It's what you do best.
All right, I'll deal with it.
Just don't give me shit later when you find out how.
Well, if you do it right the first time, I won't have to.
Have you checked the wall all the way down to the basement?
I just figured out that it got down here.
Okay, come on.
Bring the work light, please.
Have fun.
Uncle Peter, don't do that!
Come on. You used to love that when you were a little girl.
Any day now!
Coming!
How are you, Sarah?
I'm okay. Yeah?
Yeah. How are you?
Look at you.
I can't get over how grown up you are.
You gonna come down here or what?
Bite me! See you later.
Sarah? Yeah.
Wow, I can't believe you're here!
You don't remember me, do you?
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm Sophia.
We used to play together.
Oh, of course. Yeah.
How are you?
I'm quite good actually, especially now that I'm finding you here.
Why is it so dark in here?
The power's out.
My dad thinks rats chewed through the wires.
I'd invite you in, but there's really no place to hang or anything.
That's okay.
I can't stay long anyways.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
How long's it been since you were out here?
A long time, years.
Yeah. I come by once in a while, and I've seen other people here but never you.
Yeah, other family come out now and then, but no one's really been here this last summer.
Well, except for the people who keep breaking in and messing the place up.
That's terrible. Yeah.
Well, they broke almost all our windows.
My uncle had to call the police to run them off.
So what are you doing here now?
Fixing it up.
We're gonna sell it.
That's too bad.
And aside from selling this house, what are you up to?
Nothing much.
Are you in school or something?
No, me and school don't really go together.
I'm working for my dad and thinking about doing something else.
Yeah, it's tough getting any kind of job these days.
There's so many things
I want to do, but I never seem to be able to do any of them.
Can you believe how long it's been?
Remember when we used to play dress up and do makeovers?
Did we? Yeah.
Oh, my God.
It's been so long,
I swear, sometimes,
I think I have holes up here.
I have a pile of photos around somewhere.
I'll have to find them.
Yeah.
You always had the best hair.
So how long are you around for?
We've already been here a couple days, and my dad thinks we're gonna head out soon.
Really?
Well, you maybe want to hang out later?
Yeah, that could be good.
The phone lines aren't set up though and our cells don't work up here.
It's okay,
I'll just come by later.
Okay.
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.
It's so good to see you.
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.
I'll see you later.
You know, I do remember you.
How could you forget?
See you later.
John, if you care so much about the way it's done, you can do it yourself, okay?
Just do it yourself.
Just trying to be helpful.
You're an asshole.
What? What did I do now? Sorry.
I gotta get out of here, Sarah.
Whoops.
Can I have the keys to my car, please?
Uh...
You know where they are.
Give me the keys.
When you're done with your temper tantrums, see if you can get the electrician on the phone, please.
That would be awesome.
If he could come out here, we could use his needle nose pliers to get that stick out of your ass.
What was that?
I love you, brother.
I don't know why my brother always has to make everything so difficult.
Yeah, when he doesn't do what you want him to.
Exactly. You see, if everyone would just do what I say, we wouldn't have any problems, would we?
Uh-huh.
Do you need any help down there?
No, it's okay.
Okay.
Hey. What are you doing?
I just thought
I heard something upstairs.
It's probably the damn rats.
God, don't remind me.
No, it sounded like someone was up there.
Maybe it's your uncle.
No, his car's not here.
I know how you think, sweetie.
Would you like me to go upstairs and have a look?
Yeah. Okay.
Wait! I'm gonna come with you.
Jesus!
L get you?
Yeah, you did and that hurt.
I'm sorry.
What, you're trying to be funny?
A little bit.
What's that?
Uh, it's just...
It's just nothing.
It's photographs for the insurance.
I don't know why your uncle just leaves things laying around like this.
Ridiculous.
Sorry.
Honey, you're gonna really have to start making some progress in this room.
You haven't even started on this closet.
Most of it isn't mine.
So what?
It's just gonna stay here?
What are you doing in here?
I don't know if you got the fact that we're packing it up to get out...
Yes, I do understand that.
That box is completely empty.
If your cousins don't wanna help out, just keep what you want.
Throw everything else out.
Okay.
At least that's empty.
Right, but what about the noise?
Honey, it's an old house.
They make noises.
I'm sure it's nothing.
But I'll keep looking around, okay?
Thank you.
I want you to sit down, go through that stuff, and start throwing things away.
I want to come back here and see full garbage bags.
All right. You hear me?
Yes.
All right. I'll be right back.
Daddy?
Yeah?
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.
What's going on in there?
Are you packing?
Yeah, I'm throwing stuff out.
Good. That's what
I want to hear.
Dad?
Daddy?
Dad?
Daddy?
Daddy?
Come on, Dad.
Oh, my God.
Daddy, what have they done to you'?
Daddy.
Daddy, wake up.
Oh, my God.
Wake up. Wake up!
Oh, my God. You're alive.
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay, the key. Where's the key?
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna come back.
Daddy, hang on.
Okay, I'm gonna go get help.
Sarah, what are you doing out here?
Why aren't you back at the house?
Uncle Peter! Hey. Sarah.
It's okay.
Hey, what's going on?
Sarah, tell me what's going on.
They got Daddy.
Who's got...
You have blood all over you.
What is going on, Sarah?
They fucking killed him!
Sarah, who hurt your dad?
Somebody was back at the house? Who?
There was just a girl.
A girl? I don't see any girl.
Sarah, you gotta tell me what's going on so I can help you.
What is going on?
Where is your dad?
He's at...
He's in the room on the floor.
Is he back at the house? Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, where are you going?
To get your dad.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Uncle Peter, we need to go get help!
If your dad is hurt we need to help him right now.
We don't have any time to go back into town, Sarah.
No! Please!
Tell me how many people you saw back at the house.
I don't know!
Just give me an idea. One, two, three?
Tell me what I'm dealing with here.
There was one man...
Back at the house?
And then there was just a girl by the road!
Jesus, goddamn squatters!
Please, stop!
It's okay, Sarah.
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.
I don't wanna be here!
Sarah, come on, calm down.
Here. Your wrist is bleeding.
We'll tie this up first.
I got something here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I know that hurts.
All right, just put pressure on that.
Hold on to it.
Sarah, honey, it's gonna be okay.
All right'?
Where are you going?
I'm gonna get your dad.
Just stay in the car.
What are you doing?
I'm getting my gun.
You can't leave me alone here!
I'm gonna be right back!
Just stay in the car, Sarah! No!
No!
Stay in the car and lock the doors. Lock it!
Uncle Peter!
Uncle Peter!
Jesus, Sarah!
What are you doing?
I told you to stay in the car!
You left the trunk open!
No, I didn't!
I closed the trunk.
Someone got in the car!
What?
You can't open it.
I locked him out.
No!
Do you have my key?
Yeah, I'm not giving it...
Give me the key, Sarah!
I'm not gonna give it to you!
Please don't! I don't want to!
I don't want to go out there.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about before.
I didn't know.
You all right? You sure?
Yeah.
Can you show me exactly where you last saw your father?
I looked around but I didn't see anybody.
I looked quick. Take this.
How's your wrist? It's okay.
All right, we're sticking together now.
What if he gets in the basement?
Forget about it.
We're gonna get your dad and we're gonna get out of here.
Get right behind me. Come on.
Come on.
John?
John?
John?
He wasn't in that room.
Where was he?
He was in there.
Okay.
Let's look again.
He was right here.
Oh, Jesus.
Sarah, how was your father when you last left him?
Could he have gotten up?
Could he have moved somewhere?
I can't see how.
Okay, well, maybe he...
Maybe he came to.
Uncle Peter?
Over here.
I don't think there's anybody on this floor.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
What? What is that?
Uh, it's...
It's garbage. Here.
Gotta get this out of here.
Did you check upstairs?
Quickly. Let's...
Let's look again.
Wait! Stay close to me.
Give me your hand.
It's okay.
It's okay.
What?
That wasn't on before.
They took him.
I'm sorry, Sarah, we looked everywhere.
Uncle Peter.
Uncle Peter...
Uncle Peter!
That's good. That's right.
Just like that.
Good. It's okay.
Yeah. It's just a little game we're playing.
Nice.
Don't be shy.
Hmm.
That wasn't so bad.
Hmm? Was it?
How about a little snack now?
There you are.
Sophia. What are you...
Thought we had a date, didn't we?
Are you looking for this?
That's not the key to this door.
That's not the way out.
Daddy?
What did you do to him?
Not nearly enough.
Daddy want his favorite drink?
No'? I think he's going to need it.
Who are you?
Why are you doing this to us?
You have trouble remembering, Sarah.
You have holes up here.
You have the key.
Did I...
No.
Finish what you started.
No.
Leave us alone!
Stop punishing yourself, Sarah.
Sarah, ple...
You have to be quiet or you're gonna wake up Mommy and then I'll have to punish you.
So you want to play with me now?
Why are you making such a big deal?
It's just a game, don't be such a baby.
Don't... Don't...
Please don't! Please don't!
Ow, Daddy, it hurts.
It hurts.
Daddy would never hurt you.
Liar!
Look. Look at what you did.
Look at what you did to me!
How could you!
Look at what you did.
Sarah, honey, you're seeing things, people that aren't there.
You're making things up that didn't happen.
But we can get through this, baby.
You're gonna have to do what I say. Okay?
I can help you but you're gonna have to untie me first.
Sweetie...
Honey?
It's okay. It's okay.
Come on. That's right.
Just take it easy.
Just take it easy.
Oh, God. Thank you.
Now just give these to me.
All right. All right.
Okay.
Honey, it's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.
All right. You okay?
No, Daddy! Ow!
You're making me do this, Sarah.
No!
John...
Just leave her alone.
Leave her alone?
Shut up, Peter.
Shut up and enjoy the show, huh?
Just like you always did.
Right, Sarah? Let her go.
What is this, a joke?
You're such a loser.
Pretending to be dead.
And then you attack me?
This will be our special little secret.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Sarah. Please.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
It was so long ago.
I should have stopped it,
I should have stopped him.

Relax, man.
Get over here now.
Come on, man.
It's the gator fest kickoff party, døde.
Calm down, Scott.
I'll kick your ass in the bayou.
Leave it alone, Scott.
Let's go.
You know what?
I'm getting sick and tired...
Jack, your daddy's going to hear about this.
Your mama and daddies are going to get some nice fat citations now from all of you.
Okay, Jen c.
Bring it on in.
You read me? Bring it on in.
I can't wait to hear what he's got to say.
Howdy.
Looks like you had a rough night fishing.
Rough ain't the half of it.
Damn thing killed half my crew before I could get it in the tank.
What the hell's in that thing?
You pay me to find exotic animals.
Pay me.
I'm sorry about your men.
Bring it all.
Got it.
How the hell you get that thing in there?
Blood.
Put another strap on. Quick.
Hurry it up. Come on.
Move, move, move!
Come on. Move!
Move it. Move it. Move it!
Hurry! Get it going, now.
Don't say a word about this to anyone.
Sure.
Get that truck out of here.
Right.
What a lousy way to start the summer.
Krystal!
People are out of water.
Come on.
I'm coming.
That ain't part of the alligator show they got around here, is it?
So your friends dared you to come and get...
My number?
Who was that?
Oh, come on, babe.
Flirting's part of the job.
You know I'm all yours.
Well, in that case, then flirt away.
Whoo!
I hope you're all having a good time here at the gator shed.
Family owned and operated.
Always has been, always will be.
And everything that we make tonight is to send her sister to college.
Yeah.
She's the one over by the fireplace that's pretending not to know me.
There she is. Hey, krystal.
- Okay, it is 6:00...
- Right this way.
Here at the gator shed, and that means only one thing.
Kill me now.
Who would bus the tables for me?
Enjoy.
Thanks.
It is time...
To feed the gators!
Let's go!
Who wants to feed some gators?
Me!
Come on, now.
Who wants to feed some gators?
Me!
All right, that's better.
All righty.
Has a bite strength of over 2,000 pounds per square inch.
Its jaws...
Can literally snap a man in half.
And not no little man like you.
Å big man like me.
Think your brother ever gets scared of doing that?
No, he faced down the scariest creature alive.
What's more dangerous than a gator?
Well, a defensive lineman from the New York giants.
Mm-hmm.
I'll show you.
You think he misses it?
What, being pummeled so many times that he can't walk without a limp again?
Yeah, that's the one.
Yeah, he misses it.
An alligator, he swallows his food whole.
His teeth don't chew.
He grabs on, spins around, takes it down and drowns it, and then swallows it.
Anyways, after graduation,
I'm out of here.
30 Miles per hour on land.
Can you run 30 Miles per hour?
Me neither, and I'm pretty fast.
So I don't want to meet one of these things who starts chasing me.
Oop!
Cut Jackson off. He's wasted.
You got it, boss.
Ah, hey, mystery man.
Let me guess.
- Just coffee.
- Yeah.
You know, you come in here every single day, and you never order food.
I'm starting to take it personally.
I like coffee.
This coffee?
Tastes good to me.
You know, I think
I've figured it out.
What's that?
You're a traveling aluminum siding salesman.
- No.
- Okay.
Then I'm just going to have to go with secret agent.
You were closer the first time.
Name's Tommy, by the way.
So you have a name.
I'm Rachel.
I know.
I can feed them gators...
Come on, Jackson. That's it.
Okay, I'm sorry, folks.
Here you go.
Come on. Come on, Jackson.
People are trying to have a good time... hey.
All right. I'm sorry.
Come on, Jackson.
Get your hands off of me!
Look at you, Jackson.
I gotta go.
Come on, Jackson.
Swamp thing.
What kind of nature's that anyway?
Aw, come on.
Can't play football... mandling, head over to the gator shed a. S.Å.P.
We got called about a fight.
Copy that. We're on our way.
Come on, Jackson.
Jason! What are you doing?
Man, Jackson, why'd you have to go and do that?
Are you okay?
Did you see that?
Swamp thing just knocked out Jackson.
Oh, boy.
Krystal, shut it down.
- Jackson, I'm sorry.
- You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm all right.
It's just reaction.
I'm sorry.
Come on, buddy.
Let's go; Come on.
Come on, now. Rachel.
You mind stepping over here a sec?
You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and have an attorney present during questioning.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you for questioning.
If you decide to answer questions without an attorney present, you still have the right to stop answering at any time.
Assault and battery, rach.
Doesn't look good.
Jackson was looking for trouble.
It's not Jason's fault that he found it.
You think any more about what we talked about?
I have a boyfriend, sheriff.
I know, I know, you got that bartender, Mr. flirty.
You going to let Jason go or what?
Well, that all depends, cupcake.
You going to have dinner with me?
What if I told you
I'd think about it?
- Really?
- Yeah.
It might be nice.
Well, then I'd say that...
Maybe what happened here was just...
Å little misunderstanding.
Little bit.
Thank you, sheriff.
Thank you.
Okay.
Let him go.
Yeah. Come on.
Get these things off me.
- Come on.
- How'd you do that?
What'd you say?
Hey, hey. What up?
Sorry, guys. We're closed.
Let's just get the beers and head to the boat.
Well, if it's closed, you're not working, then, right?
Um, I'm... i have to help clean up.
That's too bad.
Maybe she can hang out with us this weekend.
- Oh, that'd be nice, actually.
- Yeah.
I can't.
My sister would kill me.
Come on, man.
We're going to rent a boat and go out to the lake where the cops can't find us.
Does that sound like fun?
Well, my sister would kill me and then stomp on my grave, so...
Well, you know what?
If you survive, give my boy scout a call right there.
Yeah, what's your name?
- Krystal.
- Krystal, nice.
Wear that. Wear that, okay?
Yeah.
Totally, døde.
Mm-hmm.
We'll see how the gator shed does with no gators.
Come to papa.
Come and get it.
Oh, shoot.
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Gotcha.
Hmm?
Ah!
Man.
It's a real mess, rach.
Tell me about it.
What the hell happened?
Gators are gone.
Gone? How?
Something ate them.
What could possibly eat a gator?
What?
- Um...
- Don't.
Tell me what?
Looked like a... Shark.
Å shark.
Come on, rach.
Did you have a little too much Tequila after I left last night?
I know it sounds crazy, but that is what I saw.
You saw a shark in the swamp.
Yes.
Å swamp shark.
Come on.
Go to hell.
You know, just 'cause it isn't likely doesn't mean it's impossible.
It is impossible.
Sharks live in salt water, buddy.
Actually, not all sharks live in salt water.
Medulla, pygmy, ragner.
And just 'cause a shark is predominantly salt water doesn't mean it can't swim in fresh.
Bull sharks can live up to three weeks in freshwater.
How do you know all this stuff?
He's a genius.
Not really.
I just watch a lot of cable.
Oh, great.
We don't need your help, sheriff.
Is that any way to greet your future husband, Rachel?
You know my presence out here isn't optional.
I got a report of a gunshot fired at 5:00 in the morning.
You know I got to check it out.
Mandling out here?
Sheriff!
What the heck is that?
Looks like Jackson came back out here for some kind of payback.
You want to tell me about it?
I... i don't know what you're talking about.
I bet your brother does.
I've seen a lot of crazy things down here.
I'm not saying it's impossible.
I'm going to need to bring you in for questioning.
I ain't did nothing.
I'm not saying you did, swampy.
Well, what's the charge?
He's not being charged yet.
I just got to get to the bottom of what happened out here last night.
I already told you
I ain't did nothing.
Hey, sheriff!
What the hell is that?
Oh, God.
I think it's Jackson.
Oh, hell, no.
What'd you do, chop him up and feed him to your gators?
He wouldn't do that.
I didn't even see Jackson after he left yesterday, and that's the truth.
So unless you got some evidence that shows otherwise, why don't you just leave us alone and go find out what really happened?
I know what happened.
Well, are you going to tell me, or are you going to keep it a secret?
It was the shark.
Å what?
I saw a shark last night.
I came out here, and the gator pen was all torn up, and I saw it, I shot at it, and it swam away...
It must have been coming in here to eat our gators, and maybe Jackson got in the way.
I heard it all.
You're telling me that there's a shark in the swamp.
- Actually, medulla...
- Shut up.
Now, you listen to me.
I'm going to call judge Masterson, and I'm going to tell him to shut this circus down till we can figure out what's happening around here.
- You can't do that.
- Watch me.
Sheriff Watson, this is headquarters. Over.
This is the sheriff.
Sheriff, we have a 398 in progress.
I'm on the way.
I'll be back, cupcake.
He can't do this.
We got a 398 over on... looks like drop 17.
He's not going to be gone long.
What are we going to do?
Look for new jobs?
He wanted to shut us down before his deputy got mangled.
Do whatever you want.
I'm going hunting.
- For what?
- For whatever I saw.
That thing ripped our gators to shreds.
Whatever it is, it probably killed Jackson too.
I say we hunt it, we kill it, we bring it back to sheriff Watson, clear our names, and save the business.
Rach, listen to yourself.
It's just a restaurant.
491/2 years, we've owned this restaurant, okay?
It's all we have.
I'd rather burn in hell than be the one that didn't bring us to 50.
We don't even know what it is.
How do you hunt something you know nothing about?
I may not know what it is, but I know how to find it.
The insurance company made me get them.
I didn't think
I'd ever have to use them.
Wait a second;
There are tracking chips in all of the gators?
Yup.
- Password?
- Whodat, one word.
So if your loch ness monster ate these gators, then the tracking devices are in its stomach?
Along with the rest of the gator.
Obviously.
According to the website, every ten minutes, it uploads its location to the satellite.
If it's moving, we should get a history...
Look at that.
Looks like they're having a town meeting.
Or that thing ate every last piece of them.
Even if we do catch it, how does that prove anything?
Easy, they can cut it open and identify the gators by their tracking chip.
How do we prove what happened to Jackson?
They can take a mold of its teeth and then match it to the bite marks on the arm.
What?
Catch a shark, save the restaurant.
Who's in?
Damn it.
# 'Cause I'm a little sick of it #
# don't care what the doctor said #
# sure miss your company #
# so blow your nose and stomp with me #
Are you kidding me?
I'll talk to 'em.
What the hell is this?
- What?
- The Dukes, the cooler.
This is a hunting trip, not a picnic.
Well, I'm wearing the shorts
'cause they're easy to move in, and what's in the cooler ain't no picnic.
Well, the cooler can come, but you gotta stay.
Mom and død would have let me go.
Mom and død ain't here, are they?
Rachel and me are, and we're not letting you go.
It's not fair.
Look, I know you guys really want to go, but if anything happened to you out there,
I couldn't live with myself, okay?
We understand.
Look, I have an app that's running that'll track the shark for you.
Just be careful.
Thanks, Martin.
What are you doing here?
Coming with you.
But you don't know where we're going.
Shark hunting. Small town.
We've got plenty of people.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Dude definitely comes along.
Who is this guy?
I still don't think it's a good idea.
He's a stranger.
But he's been coming to the shed for a while now.
So what? That doesn't mean you can trust him.
Why not?
Just... i don't like him.
Something about him.
I think you're jealous.
- Of him?
- Yeah.
Right.
That's ridiculous.
Hey!
You're not really going to call those guys, are you?
Why? What do you care?
They were nice.
"Nice. " More like in heat.
Yeah, well, it's not a crime for a guy to like me, you know.
I... i just... you just what?
Nothing.
Hey, stop the boat!
The transmitters say we're here, but the tags haven't moved for over an hour.
That's weird.
I found one.
Where?
Look, there's more.
Either our gators disintegrated, or that thing took a huge... watch out!
Shark!
Did you freaking see that shark?
- You were right, rach.
- Yeah.
We gotta get out of here!
We came here to hunt that thing.
I thought you wanted to help.
That was when I thought you were seeing things.
We gotta call the sheriff now.
Kill it and go home.
Yo, look!
I got this.
Are you crazy?
Oh, my God.
Didn't even flinch!
Got it!
It's trying to sink us.
- I said stop it.
- Get off the wheel.
You want to get eaten?
Where are we going, Tyler?
What are you doing, Tyler?
Getting us out of here.
- Give me the wheel.
- No, I got it.
Tyler, we're smokin' real bad.
You got to slow down, man.
Come on!
You're going to burn this thing out.
Oh, my knee!
# What up? What up?
What up? What up? #
# what up? What up? What up? #
# get your hands in the air #
# get your hands in the air #
Dude, that was classic.
- Damn it, Scott!
- Are you all right?
- What is your problem?
- Are you serious?
Like, you are absolutely...
- are you all right?
- I'm fine.
That was hilarious.
- Damn it.
- They're going to hear us.
You guys are... they don't even know where they are, let alone where we are.
I know.
But can't we go somewhere a little more private?
I hate you, and I hate that you're...
You know, I did see a little boat tied up at the dock.
What you think?
Want to take it for a spin?
Whose is it?
Hell if I know.
Besides...
It's going to a noble cause.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll go in that water...
You go.
I ain't getting in...
Hey, guys. Where you going?
Oh, uh, we'll be back.
Yeah, don't worry about waiting up for us.
We might be a while.
Oh, so you're not going to have sex, then.
What... what happened out there?
Grab the rope.
Can you make it up the stairs?
Oh, my... i can't believe it.
Martin, help me get him up the stairs.
Leave it.
All right, put him on the chair right over there.
What a mess.
My dad's boat.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
What happened?
There it is.
Come on.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Oh, my God, Marcus, I swear, if we get attacked by gators,
I will never forgive you.
Fair enough.
Oh, my God.
You're so paranoid.
Don't be scared.
Whoo!
Yeah, let's do it.
What is that?
So...
How's this?
Is this private enough for you?
Yeah.
I think this is perfect...
As long as we don't fall in.
Well, I guess we'll just have to be careful.
Hold that pose.
Damn.
Here we go.
And...
Marcus.
What? Let me see.
Damn, I look hot.
No.
Look.
- It looks like at...
- What is that?
You know what?
Maybe it's nothing.
Maybe... oh, God.
Maybe it was just your hair.
Marcus, take me back.
Take me back.
Please.
Seriously, Marcus.
Take me back now!
Take me back now. I'm serious.
All right.
You owe me.
Get me back to shore, and you can have whatever you want.
Would you go?
What?
Um...
That is a shark, Marcus.
That is a shark, Marcus.
Get us out of here.
God. Help!
Help!
Noah! Scott!
Noah!
Oh, my God.
Paddle faster, Marcus!
I'm going as fast as...
Marcus, paddle faster!
Help!
Amber, help me.
Help me.
Marcus!
No!
Help!
Help!
Get him something to bite on.
All right, hold him down.
All right, let me hold him.
You ready, bro?
Ready as I'm going to be.
Okay.
One, two...
Three!
Man, I haven't had to do that in a while.
It could have been worse.
- You ready to go again?
- Yeah.
Are you psycho?
Did you not see that thing?
I mean, look at your knee, man.
Just give up.
Give up?
Friend, you obviously never played football.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to fix this engine.
For what?
I'm going back out there.
Do you have any large
Crescent wrenches?
Yeah, on the deck.
Are you insane?
That thing has tasted people, and apparently we taste good.
Now it's going to keep on killing until somebody puts it down.
You can't stop it.
If it breathes, it can be killed.
What makes you think you can stop it?
Hey, don't worry about it.
I can handle it.
We don't need you.
I see the way you look at her.
What did you say?
Stay away from my girlfriend, man!
All right, that's enough.
Not now.
Now is not the time.
You're acting like an idiot.
Are you seriously defending him?
I'm not defending anybody.
See, this is the problem.
You defend him instead of me.
Oh, give me a break.
I could have any girl I want.
You realize that, right?
You know, I think... wow.
Tyler!
How you like me now?
- Do something.
- How you like me now?
Don't make me hurt you.
Come on!
Ahh!
You going to chill?
You going to chill?
I'm cool, man!
Troublemaker.
I have already.
That's... but that's the problem.
I've already said it once, and now I've got to repeat myself.
It's irritating.
Don't just say... just tell me what you want me to do.
Okay, all right.
I really don't like...
I should probably go.
No, no, no, it was Tyler's malfunction.
Good?
No, you're going to need a bigger band-aid.
One second.
You were really cool in there.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Right.
She your girl?
Her?
Krystal and me.
No.
No, no, no, no way.
You don't like her?
I... i do like her. Å lot.
It's the friend curse.
I'm her buddy, so she's never going to notice me.
Seize the moment.
What?
Take a shot.
What?
Something Martin and I were discussing.
Seize the moment.
Dude.
No.
What?
Wait, hold on.
What?
Hey, how's your shoulder?
Any permanent damage?
Oh, no, it's... you know, I think it's all right thanks to nurse krystal.
I'm not sure about old Tyler, though.
I'm sorry about all that.
You know what?
It's a crazy day.
Emotions are running high.
I'm sure everything will be better tomorrow.
Yeah, well, it better be, because I plan on going back out there to finish this thing.
There's not a lot of quit in you, is there?
Do you want to help me, uh...
Keep hunting?
Absolutely.
I guess I should get going.
Yeah.
Uh, get some sleep and stuff.
I will.
And don't disappear on me,
'cause I'm going to need you.
All right.
Oh.
I got to lock up.
Get any sleep?
No.
You going to open the restaurant today?
Until I see a court order, it's business as usual.
You mean other than shark hunting.
That's right.
So what do we got here?
I'm still trying to identify that shark.
Can't find anything that looks like the one you described.
That armor stuff has to be some sort of exoskeleton that's been growing for, like,
100 years.
But, I mean, sharks don't live that long.
Right.
Check this out.
There was a shark attack three weeks ago in the Gulf of Mexico, about 100 Miles from here.
The attack happened a few minutes after this probe was retrieved by marine biologists.
It's a probe that had been crawling along in deep ocean trenches...
I mean, deeper than we've ever been before.
Wait, so you think this shark is our shark?
I don't know.
Well, it would explain why you can't determine its species and why there's 100 years of gunk on it.
You're missing the point,
'cause the water pressure at the bottom of the ocean can turn a car into a soda can.
Anything that can survive at that depth is... indestructible.
Yeah.
Tell me what else this article says about where it's been.
That's the whole thing.
The people working the probe were the shark attack victims.
They radioed for help, but by the time the police boats and the recuse workers got there, there was nothing left.
Why in the hell is it in our swamp?
You got me.
Now that Jackson got his self killed,
I don't have a driver
I can trust.
Well, you've got to haul this thing out of here.
No kidding.
Not like I can run it through the department.
Figure it out.
This is your mess.
You're the middleman, and things got screwed up on your shift.
No more excuses.
I know. I know.
I'll figure it out.
You better.
Now, how are you going to make this right?
Brazilian macaws.
Å bird.
Not just a bird.
This is on the endangered species list, almost impossible to find in the states.
I can have 20 of them on a plane tomorrow.
Now, you can grab about 10 grand each, easy. is a really nice haul.
Best thing come along since them pandas.
Now all I need is a little up-front money.
How much?
10 grand.
And 10 grand for the custom agents at the port.
Get them to me in one piece, and I'll throw another 20 grand your way.
I like that.
Make up for this little shark fiasco we have here.
Hmm!
You know, I've been thinking about staying in town for the delivery.
You don't mind, do you?
Knock yourself out.
Good.
I've always wanted to see this gator fest for myself anyway.
I tell you, it's a real blast.
You'll have such a good time, you'll wet yourself.
Get that freaking thing out of here.
I'll see you at the fest.
# Well, last night, you done went too far #
# can't go back out to the bar #
Morning, ladies.
Good morning.
#... Way too fast #
# take it easy, boy #
It's about time you got here.
Sorry.
Had a late night last night.
What the hell we supposed to be doing, anyway?
The sheriff told us to keep our eyes open for anything unusual.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Well, you tell me.
Might have something to do with that shark.
Heard he turned a cage full of gators into toothpicks and sloppy Joes.
There ain't no damn shark.
The sheriff done said so.
Now, just get your ass out there, and keep your eyes open.
For something unusual.
Right.
That ain't a shark.
Just get.
I'm just getting.
Damn idiot.
This is Cooper to mandling.
Yeah, go for mandling.
Everything looks good on the dock.
There ain't no shark here.
Yeah, copy that, Coop.
Come on.
Okay, let's go.
Excuse me, officer.
Mm-hmm.
Yup.
Come on. Come and catch me.
Where you going now?
Here we go.
Ooh.
There... there was a gator.
Over there?
Big ol' gator.
Why don't you just shoot him?
I got to call this in.
Charlene, you there?
Oh!
Oh, my... come on, babe.
Krystal, answer the phone!
Gator shed. This is krystal.
Krystal.
Yeah?
It's me, Scott.
We met yesterday.
Oh! Hi.
I mean, what's up?
You didn't call.
That's what's up.
Uh, yeah, it's been super busy.
Well, forget about that.
You ready to join the party?
Well, I totally would, but... two of our friends ditched us.
So lame.
So now you have to come.
Uh, well, maybe I could stop by for a little bit.
All right, we're camped down at cypress cove about a mile west of whiskey river.
Do you know where that is?
- Of course.
- Sweet.
We'll wait for you here.
Make sure you save my number.
I already did.
I knew I liked you.
Don't be a flake.
# My soul is on trial with a public defender #
Boom! That's what's up.
Hey, she's coming.
- No way.
- Of course she's coming.
Scott?
Don't throw it.
What... you don't even know how to read it.
Catch.
Come... no, don't... man!
Careful, careful.
Careful with it.
What's this?
Well, that is a map that Martin made.
So now we have a map of all the places the shark tried to eat us.
Actually, we can use it to extrapolate where the shark is going next.
Extrapo-what?
Extrap... never mind.
Sharks move in concentric circles when marking new territory.
It's how they hunt.
The center point is where
Rachel first saw it, so you can see that it's been moving outward since.
So you can figure out where the shark is going.
I already have.
So where's it headed?
You guys aren't going to like it.
Where is this thing going?
There.
Whiskey river?
The gator fest.
# All the girls
I've known before #
# have left me hungry, left me poor #
# women come, and then they go #
# why they leave, well, I just don't know #
# another one just walked out the door #
Scott?
Scott! Hi.
Whoa, krystal, you made it.
This is awesome.
Yeah, uh, listen.
Don't pull out on the water today.
Don't go to gator fest.
There's something dangerous out there.
You know, I've heard a lot of excuses not to party, but this one... it's not an excuse.
I'm serious.
Okay, everyone's waiting.
Come on.
- Wait.
- Come on.
# Jenny turned out to be a man #
# and kitty took off with my van #
What's going on?
Join the party.
There's a shark in the water, and my brother tried to shoot it, and it totally didn't flinch.
My point is that it's deadly and we have to get out of here before it comes back.
Okay.
We're on a boat.
We'll be fine.
I have another bikini if you don't want any tan lines.
Take yours off and give her that bikini right there.
Here you go. Try this.
It makes all your troubles go away.
Well, I... i don't think you understand.
It's not just going to go away.
Chill, baby.
We're going to have a blast.
# I ain't got no damn luck #
# baby, that's for sure #
Whoo!
# Margarita in LA chiquita #
# si, un chiquita #
# si, si, para mi #
What are you doing?
We have to get off of the water.
We're not on the water;
We're in a boat.
- Stop the boat.
- No.
- Well...
- Jesus.
What, are you crazy?
Give that back!
I'm not 21. I'm not... give it back! I need that.
- No.
- Stop it.
Ah! Man, you know what?
You suck.
Dude!
- Really?
- Yeah.
Dude, relax.
You are out of control.
I'm sorry.
Look, when we get back,
I'll get you a new phone, okay?
What about the shark?
Well...
We'll stay out of the water, and we'll keep it mellow, okay?
I promise.
Let's go have some fun.
Just stay close to the shore.
All right. No problem.
# Whiskey bottle #
# give me a kiss #
# and let me take a sip of your love #
Gator shed.
Yeah, is Rachel there?
Yeah, one second.
Rachel! Phone!
Hello.
I got something you need to see.
- What?
- Meet me at the hospital.
Uh, when?
As soon as you can.
- Yeah, ten minutes.
- All right.
Paging Dr. Calvin...
Back so soon, agent brysler?
Just want to take another quick look, if you don't mind.
Hey, give me a holler if you need my help.
- Thanks, Larry.
- Agent?
U.S. fish and wildlife.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.
I've been undercover for a while now.
All this time, you didn't say anything.
I couldn't.
Besides, your place is my little place to get away and... and what?
And it was a good spot to... what, you were investigating us?
No, no, no, no,
I've been trying to make this animal smuggling case forever, but I didn't have the goods.
Now with this new evidence and your testimony... wait, that's great, but you could have told me that on the phone.
Yeah, but then I couldn't show you this.
Oh, God.
Do you know him?
I found what's left of him in the channel this morning.
You all right?
Oh.
You... Brought me here why?
You see this?
Multiple rows of teeth.
Gators don't have that, but sharks do.
Three rows.
That proves I was right.
Now I'm going to nail these guys for murder along with animal smuggling.
You were right.
You were right all the time.
In the meantime, that thing's still out there.
Then let's go hunt it down.
Hey, this is krystal.
I'm not here right now, so please leave a message, and I'll call you back.
Beep!
Wow, you guys look like you're busy.
We've been waiting on you.
Well, I'm just going to say good-bye to krystal, and then we'll be on our way.
I thought she was with you.
No.
I haven't seen her all morning.
We gotta find her.
All right, well, maybe she went for a walk or something.
- Uh, Martin!
- What's up?
Where is krystal?
I don't know.
Okay, well, maybe... all right, she met some guys yesterday, some college guys here, and they asked her to go to a party with them.
All right, college guys, party.
It's not great, but it's not the end of the world.
No, the party's on a boat.
Part of a gator fest thing.
They go up and down the river.
- Oh, no.
- We've got to find her.
Where would we even look?
There's a thousand Miles of swamp out there.
We need help, rach.
Got to call the sheriff.
I hate to agree with Tyler, but he's right.
No, that's not an option. No.
It's serious.
I hate the guy more than you do, but this is krystal we're talking about.
We've no other choice.
Yeah, we have to call.
No, you can't. You can't.
Tommy's a federal agent.
He's going to call a fish and wildlife SWAT team, and they're going to comb this lake and bring krystal home.
Give me sheriff Watson.
Tell him special agent brysler's calling and it's urgent.
Special agent brysler, fish and game.
Sheriff here?
Excuse me. Can we help you?
Deputy.
So you're a fed, huh?
That's right.
- Stanley.
- Yes, sheriff.
See if these nice people would like something to drink.
Nah, it's all right...
- get y'all anything?
- No, we're fine.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Well, fish and wildlife or not, this is still my jurisdiction.
I think we both know those are navigable federal waterways.
You want to have a pissing contest about this?
Come on, sheriff.
You're a little out of your league here.
Out of my league?
Every year, we get a bunch of renegade gators going around attacking tourists.
Now, that's not nice, but there's nothing special about it.
We've been to the morgue, and the bite marks on those kids prove they were killed by a shark.
You expect me to believe that there's a shark floating around this bayou?
We all saw it, and now we got hard evidence.
Those kids were not killed by any gator.
Then what was that big green thing that almost ripped my deputy's leg off today?
I don't know about that, but look,
I've got enough right now to call the governor, get him to shut down the whiskey river recreational area indefinitely.
What's wrong with you?
People are hurting around here since that oil spill.
Now, the gator fest begins tonight.
You want to spoil the one thing that still brings money to this town?
That's where the shark is headed.
I got deputies all around this bayou, okay, looking for gators and snakes.
If some kind of shark pops its head up... and that's a mighty big if... they can handle it.
This isn't a normal shark.
You can say that again.
It's some kind of hallucination.
Please.
You know
I can have you all arrested?
What?
I could call the governor myself.
You know we grew up together?
You didn't know that, did you?
Tell him you and your federal agent friend are making a mess of things down here.
All right, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, sheriff.
- What?
- Help us kill this shark.
And I'll do everything in my power to get the prosecution to go easy on you.
Prosecution of what?
Exotic animal smuggling, bribing state and local officials, multiple violations of the interstate commerce code to start.
So you can lock us up, but you can't shut us up.
We'll see about that, cupcake.
You're just going to arrest them, right?
I mean, I... i only work at the restaurant, so...
- Stanley?
- Yes, sheriff.
Get all these people out of here now, or put them in the jail.
Go on. Get out.
Get 'em out of here!
Is that a taser?
That's an x26... hey!
Sheriff!
Go on; Get out of here!
- Stanley.
- Swamp!
Stanley, on your feet. Now!
Come on; Get in.
Wait. His boat.
Come on!
Back it up! Hold on!
Get back here!
I'm gonna shoot!
I'm gonna... I'm gonna shoot!
What? You like that? Sucker!
Ha-ha! Did you see that?
Sucker, sheriff. Whoo!
I don't like that we left Jason behind.
First we save krystal.
Then we come back with the cavalry and bust swamp thing out,
I promise.
You three best turn my boat around right now.
Bring it back.
That's a negatory, sheriff.
Your boat's just so cute.
Real fast too, and handles nice.
Listen, chum-for-brains, you bring that boat in now.
Okay, hotshot, we'll see... that's enough of that.
Come on; Let's get our game faces on, all right?
Can anybody read me?
This is krystal broussard.
I need help.
Oh! Krystal!
Krystal, can you hear me?
Rachel! They won't let me off the boat.
What... what boat? Where?
We're in the swamp.
They won't listen.
I think we're headed for whiskey river.
Okay, we're going to come get you.
Uh, where are you exactly?
We're about... no! No! What are you doing?
Krystal?
Krystal!
Here.
I'm trying to help you.
What is your problem?
She's telling on us, man.
Would you please shut the hell up so the rest of us... did it ever occur to you that they might charge us for that?
Well, get daddy to pay for it.
No, my dad's not going to pay for everything.
He's already paid for this trip.
Now, stop laughing.
The whole trip?
Scott is such a jerk.
You want a drink?
Don't touch me, døde.
No, I don't want a drink.
Relax, man.
Stop!
You're going to hit the tree.
- Calm down.
- Calm down?
Does anyone want a drink?
Great. This is perfect.
This damn rain.
Krystal.
Got to go now.
She could be anywhere in the swamp.
She said she was heading to the whiskey river, okay?
We head over there and see if we can find her.
I thought you said that was where the shark was headed.
So going there is suicide.
No, no, it's called saving my sister.
What, do you think the cops are going to save us?
Hang on.
# And I'm slowly going to pieces #
# but it's too... #
You okay?
Coop, come in, please.
Cooper, we got a 31-20.
Coop, can you read me?
Coop, can you come in, please?
Listen, I got a 31-20, Coop.
Come on in, please.
I'm going to go down to the gator fest.
You keep an eye on Shrek here.
Yes, sheriff.
Since everyone's so interested in me catching the shark,
I'm going to go find some bait.
Oh, man.
Dude, you broke the prop.
No, I didn't.
I told you we shouldn't have gone.
Would you please shut up?
Dude, chill. All we got to do is call for help.
My phone doesn't have any bars here.
That's what a radio's for.
All right, short straw goes to see what the trouble is.
You ain't special, krystal.
You got to play too.
No one should go in the water.
It's safer to stay here until we get help.
I'm getting sick and tired of baby-sitting you...
I'll take hers.
All right.
You're lucky
Noah is such a gentleman.
Well, let's show 'em.
Looks like you win, døde.
You guys suck.
Yeah, man, it's definitely clogged.
Well, go unclog it, genius.
All right, hand me the pliers from the toolbox.
If I'm not back in two minutes, just wait longer.
Shut up. Hurry.
I can't get at it.
Dude, you didn't even try.
Go down there, and spend a little more time than two seconds, man.
You're hilarious.
What's going on?
- Scott!
- Scott!
Scott!
Oh, my God, where is he?
Oh, my God! Shark!
- Scott!
- Scott!
Shark! Shark!
- Come on!
- Come on!
Come here!
Faster! Faster!
Scott!
Hold on. I got it.
Baby, hold on.
I gotcha. I got it.
Cut it!
Hurry!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Look at me.
No, no, no, look at me.
There!
That's got to be krystal.
Listen to me, baby.
I got you, baby, okay?
Stay with me.
Tell her to stay calm.
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay.
I got you, okay?
Tell her to stay calm.
How can you stay calm like this?
We have to get out of here!
Well, we're still stuck on something, unless you feel like going for a swim to get us loose.
Watch her!
Here. Here!
Go. Keep pressure on that.
I think I got a way out of this.
Damn it.
What?
I could swear it came from over here.
- Krystal.
- No, it's Rachel.
We're still trying to find her before the shark does.
Crap! Oh, hey, listen.
I've been thinking of ways you could kill it.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Can you get to the sheriff's station?
Sure. Why?
I need you to help me break Jason out of jail.
Really?
Cool.
Get there as fast as you can.
I've got to make another call.
Okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
So is it true you used to play for the NFL?
I played a little ball myself.
Went all the way to state my senior year.
I wasn't a starter or anything;
I was a backup.
But I was ready every game for four years.
That's right.
The team really relied on me.
You know, the bench, they support the team.
Hello. Deputy Stanley speaking.
Yes, ma'am.
Hold on just a second.
It's your sister.
Hello. Rachel?
Did he hand you the phone off his desk?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good. Listen.
Mm-hmm.
O- okay. All right.
Uh, deputy?
- Yeah.
- I'm through.
All right.
Hey, give me the phone.
Unlock the cell, or I'll pop your head off.
Benchwarmer.
Okay.
How'd you get out?
Oh, don't worry about that.
Hey, come on. Move over.
You know we got to go back to the restaurant.
We ain't got time for that.
Now, move over. Come on.
I'll show you how to drive this thing.
Come on. Come on. Move over.
Move over.
I'll show you how to drive this thing.
Just be gentle with it, all right?
- Hang on, baby.
- All right?
Hold my feet. Hold my feet.
No, don't go in.
You have to get to a hospital, Sarah.
All right.
Hold on.
It's coming loose. I got it.
Come on!
It's coming.
Come on.
It's coming.
Hold on.
Don't go. Don't go in.
I almost got it. Hold on.
Rachel!
Rachel!
Krystal!
Krystal, where are you?
Rachel!
She's over there.
Krystal! Krystal!
Look, the problem is that the shark comes from one of the harshest biospheres in the world.
It has to be built like a tank just to swim around the block.
So what's your plan for killing it?
Well, even tanks have soft spots if we can get the hatch open.
- You mean its mouth?
- That's right.
We got to get this thing from the inside.
- I like it.
- Yes!
Hang on!
Krystal!
Rachel!
Rachel! Rachel, I'm over here!
Look, there she is.
This should work for a can opener.
Ugh.
You see anything that'll give it some indigestion?
Uh, that should do it.
Grab it.
Now all we need is a ride.
Come on; Let's go.
You think they'll let us borrow the boat too?
We'll ask 'em later.
Okay, yeah. Wait, what?
Come on. Just get in!
Okay, I'm... no, me.
- Come on.
- I'm coming.
Help. Okay.
Oh, shoot. Oh, shoot!
We'll bring it back later!
Come back with my boat!
Come back with my boat!
Come back!
Rachel!
What are you doing?
Rachel!
Why are you stopping?
Get in there.
Hey, we can't get stuck in there like she did.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'll never sneak out again.
We'll talk about that later.
Grab a rope.
I'm so sorry.
Oh!
I'll never sneak out again.
I'm so sorry.
You gotta jump.
No, no, no,
I have to get Sarah first.
Oh!
Krystal!
I got it. I got it.
You're going to let
Mr. secret agent man get all the glory?
Just get krystal.
Come on.
Hurry.
Careful.
Tyler! Tyler!
Oh, no. Tyler, grab my hand!
Grab my hand!
Tyler! Tyler!
Tyler!
No! No!
No!
Tyler!
God.
Oh, my God!
I'm going to kill that mother... we can't stop it.
We don't have the right equipment.
No, we don't, but Martin does.
Head for shore. Come on.
Somebody help me over here.
She's really hurt.
We need this. Here, clean one.
Come on!
All right.
You son of a bitch,
I got a surprise for you.
Yeah? What?
Rachel, Rachel.
No, I can barely hear you.
What? Huh?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, okay, we'll be right over.
Okay.
We got to go to gator fest.
Get your funnel cakes here.
# Every time you get aggravated #
# I get shoved back #
# hold on to your anchor #
# you're gonna push too hard #
# I've been looking for a cure, little girl #
Come on, Jeanette;
You can do better than that.
# You're gonna push too hard #
# I've been playing every single night #
# for every wrong of your day #
# you can beat an old dog so much #
# before he runs away #
# I've been playing every single night #
# for every wrong of your day #
# you can beat an old dog so much #
# before he runs away #
# jam up now #
How's it going?
The usual.
Some drunks, some parking tickets, a couple of pickpockets.
Ain't no sign of a shark, though.
Let's hope it stays that way.
Never seen anything like this.
Oh, what's going on?
Where the hell'd they go?
You see where they went?
Sheriff!
It's our damn boat.
Yeah, it's about time you brought that boat back.
Tie it up first.
Get a paramedic right away!
Get e. M.T.!
Hey, sheriff!
What the hell is going on around here?
She's lost a lot of blood.
Trauma dressing.
Sheriff, who's going to pay for these damages?
Not now, Lassie.
I've got bigger fish to fry.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, tie it up.
Go, go, go, go.
He's coming.
Sheriff, you need to get everybody out of the water.
There's a shark coming.
Shark!
Sheriff, shark!
Oh!
Right there. You see it?
Get them kids out of the water.
Get them kids out of the water now.
Boys! Out of the water!
Hurry!
Whatever you got going, now's the time.
Jason, go!
Swamp thing, go!
Huh!
Fourth and long.
Time for the hail Mary.
Coming through.
Uh!
Come on. Take the bait.
Shoot it now!
Get down.
Squeak!
That was never going to work.
Fire up the airboat.
Come on, baby. Come on.
Stay here.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Martin, you're going to have to hold this!
- I don't know how!
- Just get up there!
I'll tell you what to do!
Come on!
Just hold the gas!
Hit the gas when I tell you to!
Which is the gas?
- Hit the gas!
- Where's the gas?
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Boy, that shark's no match for the broussard family.
Unbelievable.
What's he doing?
Squeak!
Federal agent.
You're under arrest.
Mandling!
Get your hands off me.
Not a chance. Grab the pole.
I want to see my lawyer.
Yeah, I bet you do.
Incarcerate this gentleman.
Okay.
I guess I'm in charge now, huh?
Come on.
You have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
Looks like you got your man.
Now what are you going to do?
I could use a cup of coffee.
You know any good restaurants around here?
Yeah, I know one.
Coffee sucks, but the waitresses are nice.
That's good enough for me.
Man: Stop!
He's running towards--
Stop!
On the ground!
What happened?
Here on the remote island of Kuttyhunk globally famed as a hotbed for scientific research...
Proverbial gold has been found in a new breed of pearl, genetically engineered by the innovative scientific community that lives and runs this tiny island.
Scientists from around the world moved here after World War ll as a meeting ground for inventive minds.
Mason, famous for controlling his image, refused to comment on this groundbreaking achievement.
Man:...Ieaving this reporter wondering, if they can produce this, what else are they capable of?
Today is day one of the Human Growth Project.
We believe that through continued development of parasitic research we can provide humanity with a tool that will remove the limitations placed on us by our DNA.
Some people thought this to be impossible until now.
This is important.
This is monumental.
And we have distribution in six out of the eight major territories-- quite an achievement.
We need to think even bigger.
We need to think global.
We need to think evolution.
Look at where we started and look how far we have come.
I should acknowledge my niece
Amanda Lane, without whom this would not have been possible.
Behind this curtain--
Run! Run!
We've managed to control the outbreak.
There have been fewer than two dozen deaths.
- ( screaming )
- In the pan is a layer of ocean water.
And since the island is surrounded by salt water,
I think the mainland will remain safe for quite some time.
But we are so close.
Amanda has the antidote.
We can reverse-engineer--
I can make this work.
This is sadly part of the process.
Man: Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Get out of here!
Let me in! Let me in!
Oh, Jesus.
- Sarah, hey.
- Hey.
- It's nice to put a face with the name.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
Hi. How's everything at the camp?
Fine, I guess.
- It's not that bad.
- What's not?
He's landsick.
Things are still moving.
Yeah, I don't feel too well either.
It is a little choppy out there.
You don't have to make excuses for me.
- I wasn't.
- Yeah, you were.
Weird being back, huh?
A little.
I told you I'd take care of it.
No, it's good to get closure.
I'm glad you called. The compound's kind of fallen apart over the years.
That's why I brought my cleaning crew.
- Oh my God.
- How do you guys know each other?
Boyfriend, stepbrother, friend.
- Best friend.
- Best friend.
Should we show them how we make out sometimes?
What? Like you guys don't want to see us making out.
And you're Mason's niece?
He was my great uncle, yeah.
He and your mom are pretty famous here on the island.
Jamie: Actually, my mom died here when I was a kid.
But Marco got a call that Mason had passed away and left his property.
So we're just here to clean it and sell it.
- Is it worth a lot?
- It's worth $2 million, actually.
- No way.
- But the weirdest part is that last month I was paying their rent and this month they're millionaires.
- You're gonna let that go?
- I'm not saying you have to pay me--
- It's my fault.
- Justin.
No. I got sick and they paid for me again.
He has low immunity.
I should be paying you back.
Don't worry about it, bro.
It'll work out.
And we're gonna pay back your trust fund with interest.
Awesome.
Do you hear that?
She's fine, baby.
Go to sleep.
Don't worry, Mom.
I'm fine.
I'm not worried, sweetie.
Come here.
They're awake.
Robert.
Honey, get up.
Robert: What?
Emily.
Emily, it's gonna be okay, baby.
We're gonna get you some help.
We're fine, Dad.
Daddy.
This place is worth $2 million?
Okay, well, I stayed up all night making the CD so that when we clean we could--
Wait, you said tonight was chill time.
But it's French '80s disco.
French '80s disco?
Jamie, I'm gonna go to my room take off my shoes, tickle my accordion and go to bed.
- And tomorrow we can do--
- Kristin.
Tomorrow we can do it, Jamie.
Am I right?
- No.
- I deem this weekend you shall be with a mustache.
- No.
- It's a mustache weekend, Justin.
- Kristin.
- And it looks so perfect.
You look like a man.
Oh, do you think you could grab my accordion?
It's too heavy for me.
Thank you.
But be careful with it.
It means a lot.
Why did you even invite her?
Because that chick would body-block a bus for me, and she hates public transportation.
Come on, baby, this is me.
I just--
I want to sell this place, you know, and have it be done.
You are in luck,
'cause I am here-- the fixer of all things.
Yeah, after you break them.
Yeah, but I fix them though.
Did you hear anything?
No, sorry, babe.
- Slimy Toads.
- Huh?
Slimy Toads-- it's the name of our bunk.
So why don't you make your call and then meet me there... naked?
I like Slimy Toads.
- Mommy.
- Jamie.
I'm so proud of you.
I like it.
How is this any different from the last room?
Well, you're here, for one.
So?
So I'm scared to be alone, Justin.
I don't want to get hurt again.
I don't know. I get scared.
- ( screams )
- What?
I totally got you.
Bottom or top?
I like it on top.
Good. It's all yours.
No, Justin, I said that I like it on top--
Justin: Could you not--?
I came here to get some quiet, not to be told what to do by some bossy boss lady.
You know, some people think
I'm fun.
Good.
Fuck.
Hey, excuse me.
How are you?
Do you happen to know where a local pay phone is?
What the hell?
Moron.
On the TV I saw a man selling second chance
I thought, "What kind of sucker needs to buy self-confidence?"
I sit alone on a Friday night in boxer briefs
Saying I realize--
Oh, this is incredible.
Gina.
No, I mean you told me about them but--
We've got to figure out how this is happening again so we can stop it. Listen.
Infection, cellular lymphomatosis fusion, reproduction.
Gina, these things infect.
They ingest.
They multiply and destroy.
There's no middle ground here.
Maybe it's some kind of mutation gestating in a plant or a bug.
I mean, parasites live just about anywhere.
A fish maybe?
No, probably not a fish, at least not saltwater anyway.
Watch.
Watch what happens.
Here. Salt kills parasites-- their chief vulnerability.
Well, handy that we're surrounded by salt water.
Talk to me about the first outbreak then.
Well, parasites have been used in science for hundreds of years now.
Tapeworms are utilized to keep people thin.
Maggots are used for exfoliation.
Parasites-- microscopic parasites can be given a simple set of instructions.
They then burrow into their host and they can manipulate their DNA.
We started with shellfish, engineering oysters that produced perfect, lustrous and round pearls.
And money from the pearls funded further research.
We set out to make the perfect human.
And at first we were successful.
They became strong, their senses heightened.
The subjects became intuitive.
But we made one major miscalculation.
The parasites needed to feed and consumed the host from the inside.
Okay, you can't tell me that and then leave me alone in here.
Gina, it'll be fine.
I'll just be a minute. You're okay.
But--
I'm not gonna be able to keep this a secret much longer.
People are gonna think--
People will think what I tell them to think.
- Things have changed, Larkin.
- You forget who you're talking to.
Are you questioning my loyalty here, Jake?
Oh, I'm questioning a lot more than that, Doc.
How dare you bring Jamie onto the island without consulting me?
If there's even a chance that she can bring us to the antidote, we've got to try.
You still believe that fairy tale?
No, this is our burden, Macavire.
We said that coming in and I'm saying it now.
Bringing innocents into this is madness.
No, not bringing them would be.
We have a larger responsibility.
I wouldn't be lecturing anybody on responsibility, Doc.
Stanley, please.
It's over.
It was a freak incident.
It's been 20 years.
That's what concerns me.
You'll do as you're told.
Jamie leaves now.
Wouldn't be the first time you've been wrong, Larkin.
Mm-hmm.
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Justin!
- What?
- You're not very good at that.
You try it.
I saw some townspeople today.
Oh, yeah? Did you paint mustaches on their faces too?
- No, actually it was really creepy--
- I don't care.
Are you still mad about that?
Beginner's luck.
And I'm not mad.
Why do you need to be alone so bad?
Why can't you be?
We have orders.
Goody.
This can't be done.
You've already done it.
Amanda: On shellfish.
What you're talking about is something completely different.
Mason: I have faith.
Well, I have doubts, Mason.
It's too big. It's too dangerous.
And there's no time for--
Mason: Necessity is the mother of invention.
Right?
Jamie, stand up.
Let me see how big you've gotten.
Okay, look.
Coming.
- Jamie Ackerman?
- Yes.
My name is Larkin Holberman from the city council.
We know of your great uncle's passing and we wanted to extend our most heartfelt condolences.
Mason was a friend.
Thank you.
So I'm pleased to inform you the City of Kuttyhunk has agreed to offer you
$75,000 for the rights to this land.
No, thank you.
We have more substantial offers.
From other islanders?
No, from the mainland.
But Miss Ackerman, you only have the rights to this property.
Ownership can only be exchanged between islanders.
No.
I actually have this.
Uh, let's see...
Okay, right here, actually.
In the state of Maine--
I'm afraid the local statute takes precedence in cases like this.
Have you discussed this with a lawyer?
No, I talked to a real estate agent.
I suggest that you talk to a lawyer.
Are you saying that I have no course of action?
Well, you could take it up with the head of the city council.
- Great. Who is that?
- That would be me.
This land is worth $2 million.
- I'm afraid my hands are tied.
- Are they?
But we do have $75,000 for you.
This won't even cover our debt.
It's better than nothing,
Miss Ackerman.
Think it over.
And I am truly sorry.
Enjoy the ham.
I was thinking about it, and I think we should just spend it all.
Marco--
Humor me.
How would you spend it?
A 50-day 50-state shopping spree.
Ooh, reckless spending.
I like it.
What is that?
Hey, did you bring your medicine with you?
I'm fine.
Dude, you know we're alone on this island.
I'm really sorry if I pissed you off or something, but we should probably try to make the best of it.
We can play bullsnit.
Bullsnit?
It's this game where I say something, and if you think it's fake you say "bullsnit."
And if it is fake, then I'll make a funny face.
And if it's not fake, they you'll make a funny face.
Okay, I think this game sounds dumb.
How about this one?
I had a thing with Marco before Jamie did.
Bullsnit.
- Oh my God.
- Mm-hmm.
Face.
Kristin: Good.
Justin: What happened?
I can't tell you because that's not the rules of the game.
Your turn.
Okay, this is-- this is kind of messed up, but when me and Jamie were kids--
Wait, your dad married her mom?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
After she left the island she came to live with us for three months.
And we used to experiment sexually a little bit.
Oh my God.
Face.
Oh my God, that was pretty good.
In all seriousness though,
I know I've been kind of aggressive with you, and it's because I like you.
And we only have two days left, so...
Kristin--
And I'm snitting.
It's just I'm not the kind of guy that gets together with girls, you know, just for-- you know, that--
For fun?
Yeah. It's not you.
It's just, you know, 48 hours just--
I don't think, you know, probably--
Is that cool?
Totally.
Bullsnit.
You know, I would say like, if I can drive six miles without pushing the brake, then Johnny Dexter will ask me out.
And?
I mean, it works usually.
Like I would say, if I can hold my breath until I see a blue Prius then I would lose five pounds.
And you did?
No, not every time.
- I wouldn't always see a blue Prius.
- ( laughs )
Okay, so you're saying if I could swim across that lake, then I'll get whatever I want?
No, that's not what I'm saying.
There has to be an aspect of randomness to it,
Iike if you could tread water until you see a bird--
--then I'll get whatever I want.
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, okay then.
Ohh-hh.
- I'm doing it.
- ( laughs )
Holy Christ, it is cold.
Holy what?
Watch out for sharks.
What?
Jamie: Mason and I used to play this game all the time.
He called it "the hunt."
It reminds me-- my uncle used to distract me.
He used to stick up his left hand.
And if you focus on the left hand, you don't see what the right hand is doing.
That's fascinating.
We're missing something.
Kristin: Maybe it's not meant to be.
No, I got a few more hours in me.
Really?
No, I'm giving up right now.
Kristin: I'm getting hungry.
Look!
Justin: What? Oh.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
It had to be while treading water.
Really?
Yeah, I don't know.
It's how l--
Really?
Come here. You're shivering.
No, I'm fine.
Here. Is that better?
Yeah, thanks.
- Does that help?
- Yeah, I think so.
Oh, I forgot that you don't hook up with girls just for fun.
Screw it.
I'm quick.
Yeah, me too.
Justin.
Come here.
Put your hand on my neck?
That's anticlimactic.
Is there anything fun?
This is kind of fun.
Wow, it's beautiful.
Hmm.
What's in there?
Pictures.
Oh, wow.
I got it.
And now I'd like to introduce the man of the hour and someone I am proud to call my friend,
Mason Lane.
I know this.
- Mason: Thank you.
- This is important.
Mason: Before we continue,
I should acknowledge my niece
Amanda Lane, without whom this would not have been possible.
Jamie, you guys, something's wrong with Justin.
Now in order for lntercorps to continue to expand at its desired rate, we need to think bigger.
We need to think global.
We need to think evolution.
Behind this curtain--
Mason: We need to think evolution.
Parasites feed on adrenalin.
And once they acquire the taste, they grow, consuming it from the host.
This perfect strand will be ready in months;, not years, not decades-- in months.
It is the key to our continued evolution.
Intercorps can bring this to the world.
Imagine the possibilities.
I beg you not to stop us from completing our task.
It is Adam's rib.
Was he breathing?
I don't know.
He was scared.
He just started shaking, so I came to get you guys.
Where were you?
It was right here.
Justin!
Justin!
Justin! Justin!
What's going on, buddy?
Can you talk?
I'm so cold.
It's ripping me.
- What was that?
- We gotta get him to camp, come on.
- What the fuck was that?
- You're scaring him. Help me out.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
We're gonna get you help.
Marco: Help me out.
Help me out.
Tell me exactly what happened.
We were near the water and then he went into the water.
- Maybe the lake's contaminated.
- Did you see that thing in his stomach?
- I saw it too, maybe a muscle spasm.
- Is he getting sick again?
- Let's not think that.
- Did you see any signs?
- I don't know what to look for.
- Where are his pills?
- Jamie: He gets shots now.
- Marco: He needs a doctor.
I'm getting help.
( Jamie knocking ) Sarah, there's something wrong with Justin.
I'm gonna run down to the dock, see if I get any service.
I should clean off maybe.
Yeah, it's fine.
He's not going anywhere.
I'll be back soon.
Hang in there, buddy.
Are we being followed?
Jamie: This is the closest place with a phone?
Sarah: Yeah.
I'll be right back.
Hello?
Hello, is anyone there?
Please, my brother is sick.
Can I just use your phone?
Please.
I can see you.
Please, I just need your help.
My brother is sick.
Hello?
I can see you.
Please, my brother is sick.
- Jamie: Should we go to the cops?
- Sarah: They're idiots.
We're not going to the cops.
Dr. Mac will know what to do.
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Are you okay?
You're better now.
Me?
I'm fine.
Did you break the door?
Uh...
- You got a little--
- What?
- A little something.
- Oh.
I don't think you finished, but I'll do it for you.
A little mustache.
A mustache.
Really?
Kristin: What?
Well, round two?
The shower's ready.
Jamie: Dr. Mac's house, right?
Sarah: Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Look.
Kristin over walkie-talkie:
Hello?
Hey, it's Jamie.
Kristin: Thank God. I've been trying to reach you for, like, five minutes.
Justin is okay.
What happened?
I don't know.
He just-- he got better.
Really? That's great.
We're headed home.
Hello, is anybody out there?
Can you hear me?
Hello, is anybody out there?
Can you read me?
- Man: Oh, yeah.
- ( wood creaking )
I'm sleeping.
( rock music playing, people chattering )
What can I do you for?
Whiskey.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but can I talk to you for a second?
I'm busy here.
I've never really done this before, but I see you with your friends, surrounded by all this stuff, these people, and I don't know, you seem interesting.
Really?
I could be totally wrong, but I see someone who's stuck, wanting, waiting to get away from here, to be something, someone whom you forgot to be.
This guy, man.
He's treating you poorly.
You should leave him.
I'm not saying that I can help you get there or anything.
I just feel like maybe we're the same, you know?
Two little people wanting a chance to be different.
Yeah, you got me all figured out.
No. No.
Please, this is ridiculous.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Then why is your heart racing?
Is there a problem?
Only if you want one.
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Andy.
Yeah? I don't think so. I saw this guy physically grabbing on you.
As if there's any other way.
What did you say?
I said you're a small-town boy who should be moving on now.
You're the one who needs moving, pussy.
I sure as shit ain't gonna let you sit here and put your filthy hands all over my girl.
Well, I'm sorry.
You're right.
Goddamn right I'm right.
We should go outside.
You guys, this is so stupid.
Shut up.
This asshole can't just walk in here with his stupid-ass sunglasses and act like he owns the place, no.
You can walk away from this.
You sure do talk tough.
Why don't you show me what you got?
But that's not how it works.
You have to come to me.
'Cause you're scared?
That's what I thought.
Hey!
No harm no foul.
Have a drink on me.
Seriously, guys,
I don't want to hurt you.
All right.
This has been fun.
That was incredible.
No no.
He's drunk.
Come on, let's go, okay?
Wait wait, let me see your eyes.
- You're freezing.
- I'm fine.
- What is this?
- It's nothing.
What is this?
- It's nothing.
- ( straining )
Just a second.
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.
You didn't have to do that.
Oh, yes, I did.
You had us worried there for a minute.
Yeah.
But you're better.
Much.
Here you go.
Your mom used to make my dad breakfast in bed.
What?
Yes, she would-- she would cut a flower and put it in a vase and surround it with salt and pepper shakers and make egg in the hole.
Yeah, egg in the hole.
I remember that she did that the day that they talked.
She didn't know that I was there.
I was just playing by the side of the bed and--
And she said that every time she looked at me she thought about my mom and how much he loved her.
And then-- and then she said that she couldn't stand it anymore.
And a few days later they-- they came to pick me up.
And-- yeah.
You know, you should be glad you didn't grow up in that house.
It was not good.
Justin, we're not getting money.
What?
I thought I could handle it, but--
I wanted to get you that treatment.
It's stupid, I know.
No. No, it's not stupid.
Jamie, you're my sister.
Step-sister.
But you're my blood.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I guess I'm not 100% yet.
Where's Kristin?
Okay.
Thanks.
- How's it going?
- Good.
Just chopping away.
Looking good.
Thanks.
I, uh...
This is awkward.
You're Jamie's only family and--
My God, why is this so hard?
Um...
I-- what I was asking is--
I was asking for Jamie's hand in marriage.
Wow.
Yeah, it's-- this isn't easy for me.
Look at me. I'm a mess.
Relax.
- I mean, I brought the ring.
- ( screeching )
You know, I wasn't gonna ask, but everything's been so tense around here that I thought, you know, maybe I would, you know--
Listen, I'm late for meeting Kristin by the lake, but I'm happy to be brothers.
( whispering ) Hello, Jamie?
Anybody? Hello?
Kristin over walkie-talkie:
Jamie, hello? Jamie?
Can you hear me?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Do you want to open a military supply shop?
- We're not getting the money.
- Huh?
There was some ordinance.
And I tried to fix it, but it got all messed up.
And there weren't any phones.
God, Marco.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Listen, we can open a flea market.
- I want you to relax.
- Really?
Yeah, as long as you handle the fleas.
I don't like bugs.
I was so nervous to tell you.
Well, speaking of nerves...
- ( knocks on door )
- Yes?
Excuse me.
Is someone here sick?
- Who wants to know?
- I found this note on my door.
Dr. Macavire.
Jamie Ackerman.
I used to play with your granddaughter.
Oh, yes, absolutely, of course.
It's great to see you again.
The note says that your brother is unwell. Are you he?
No, he just left a minute ago.
- Hmm, that's a speedy recovery.
- Yeah, it was, actually.
Muscle spasms, shortness of breath, disorientation, complaints of cold?
- How did you know?
- He just left, you say?
- Yeah.
- Where? How long ago?
To the lake, about five minutes ago.
We can catch up to him--
He's on foot on the trail to the lake.
- What are you doing?
- Jamie, are these his sunglasses?
Jamie, he's diseased.
He's very sick.
And I need to see him right away.
For what?
- To help him, of course.
- ( footsteps )
What's with all the heavy artillery?
He already attacked one woman, killed her.
She was last seen with him. Those glasses were found next to the body.
- That doesn't prove anything.
- No, of course not, but it does raise suspicions.
- Come on.
- Jamie.
Kristin!
Kristin!
- Gun!
- ( two gunshots )
You're gonna kill us all.
No, man, just you.
Look at him.
He's sick.
I'm sorry.
Oh my God.
Darren Francis Roberts,
Mary's son, three kids, a good man.
That he was.
How is this happening, Doc?
A half-life maybe.
I don't know.
Tape 'em.
Jake--
Feeling better?
What is this place?
It's our sanctuary.
Who are you?
It's me, sweetheart.
Welcome home.
Oh my God.
Mason. Oh God.
You've grown.
Look.
One of God' overlooked gifts to humanity,
Iike me.
This will keep you safe.
Mason, I can't do this anymore.
I know.
- What are you doing?
- What needs to be done.
Now she has to give us the antidote.
You've lost it, Mason.
Tell me where the antidote is so I can save you.
I destroyed it.
You killed her.
Mason: This solution helps to keep the parasites at bay.
Your mother had developed an antidote that could have stopped all of this.
But it doesn't matter now.
Even if you do know where it is, you are the only one.
What's gonna happen to Justin?
I've been watching you.
I needed a diversion to get you here alone.
This is the place where your mother and I designed to evolve mankind.
I have devoted my life to that goal.
But I became old and ill.
I had to infect myself in order to survive.
But I'm close.
Any day now my work will be complete.
When I was stationed here with the task of evolving mankind--
That's enough!
No!
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Go through sections 1, 3 and 6.
See if there are any survivors and bring them here.
Sections 4, 8 and 11 have all been overrun.
Larkin, my father lives in 11.
- Jamie over walkie-talkie: Hello?
- No.
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Jamie, is that you?
Thank God.
I'm trapped in a laboratory with Mason Lane.
Whoever you are,
I need your help.
Jamie, listen,
I know where you are.
Get out and find someplace to hide.
I'm on my way.
You take care of them.
I'll deal with this.
Man: Somebody help me!
Man: Help!
It's over, Jamie.
Come out.
It's over.
Mason.
Ah, coming to touch greatness again?
No, I came to see the man who spoke of greatness but never understood what that meant.
Let's put an end to this.
I came unarmed.
That was a mistake.
Stop.
- It's over.
- Yes.
No.
God damn it all, it shouldn't have come to this.
We're in the business of helping mankind, not killing innocent people.
And you shouldn't even be here.
God damn Macavire
Iuring you out here with some made-up inheritance story.
Wait, why would he do that?
Because he wanted the antidote to stop the outbreak
- and he thought you had it.
- What about you trying to get rid of me for 75 grand?
I was trying to save you, to get you away from all this.
Save me?
You and Mason killed my mother.
No, sweetheart,
I came back for you.
It was me that got you off the island.
Your mother died trying to stop that lunatic.
She knew that the antidote was the only thing that could stop his master plan.
If you do have the antidote, this island is the last place you should be.
Your mother--
- ( car honking continuously )
- ( baby crying )
Is that Sarah's car?
Okay.
Larkin: You got it?
Jamie: Yeah. Shh.
Shh.
Let's get you out of here.
It's okay. Shh.
There should be a gas can in here somewhere.
What is this place?
We preserve the pearls with salt and ship them around the world.
Come on.
That's what all these people are doing on the island.
We've got a ready-built--
Here, fill the engine.
I'll be right back.
Just go do it now. Go.
You don't have to do this.
Wait. Please.
If you're looking at the left hand, you don't see me.
Wait. Wait.
Wait.
Please.
Jamie, don't go.
Please don't leave me here.
Come back.
I don't want this.
Jamie.
Jamie!
This will keep you safe.

My name is Jerry Hartfeld.
I run a video production company, here in Anaheim, California.
We focus mainly on reality television shows.
If you ever seen the show,
"Tornado Trackers", it's one of ours.
A tape arrived in the mail.
It was a pilot episode of a new reality series called "Grave Encounters".
And it was by a young producer named Lance Preston.
The idea was that him and his group of paranormal investigators, would investigate ghost sightings and hauntings and things of this nature.
And this was, you know, years before all the other ghost haunting shows that are out there now.
I mean, I really felt he was ahead of his time.
My name is Lance Preston.
When I was a boy my family moved into a house that I soon discovered was haunted.
The things I encountered, have stayed with me forever.
Ever since then, I have been obsessed with trying to capture proof that these things were real.
Come along with me and my team of skilled paranormal investigators as we dare to venture into some of the most haunted locations known to man.
Spending the night, and capturing everything on camera.
If you're ready, it's time to have some
GRAVE ENCOUNTERS
And everything was... you know, going really smoothly.
I mean, the edits that were coming back were great.  We were very excited.
We really had some thing, you know.
And then of course, they got the Episode 6.
Uh, do you have anything else you want to say?
Yeah!  I want to be very clear about this.
What you're about to see is not a movie.
Okay?
This is been assembled from some 76 plus hours of raw mini DVD source footage that was shot for Lance's show.
Not a frame of this had been doctored, hasn't been manipulated in any way.
This is just raw footage, it's been edited strictly for time.
Cut!
Hello! Hello!
Testing! Testing.
Lance Preston!
Keep a good portion of this in the back the whole time.
I'm gonna move a little bit, but...
- Are you ready then?
- I'm ready.
You're still in the shot.
I can... I want to get you clean.
- One step back.
- Well, good?
Good evening!
And welcome to another episode of Grave Encounters.
I'm your host,
Lance Preston, as always.
And tonight I am very excited to take you inside one of the most terrifying locations I have ever seen.
Behind me sits the
Collingwood Psychiatric hospital.
It's one of six buildings spread over 80 acres of land, just outside ...
We are gonna pick it up from there.
I'm not gonna do from beginning part again.
And between the years 1895 and 1960, it played home to more than 80,000 of Maryland's most mentally ill and disturbed individuals.
After its closure in 1963, reports of ghostly apparitions, objects moving on their own.
And sometimes even the lunatic laughter of the patients condemned to roam these halls.
Tonight, my crew and I will be performing an 8 hour lock down.
Trapped inside, during the peak hours of dead time.
Using the most sophisticated in ghost hunting equipment we will be in search of what's become known as the ghost of the
Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital.
- Cut.
- Nice!
Yeah?
- Morgan!
- Hi
- Morgan Turner! How are you?
- Yeah.  Hi.
- Oop! Perfect.
- Thanks for coming up man.
Especially to make you drive all the way.
That's okay.
I'm really happy to do it.
- Is um... is this going to be on TV?
- Yeah, that's what we hope.
Hey, not this part.
I'm just shooting this.
Oh, don't worry about it, she shoots everything.
I'm here with Morgan Turner, local town historian.
Morgan is here today to shed some light on the institute's dark past.
Morgan?  Can you tell us when the institute was first built?
Well! The history of Collingwood is fairly typical of similar hospitals of the era.
It was built in 1893... to address the sort of growing over crowding problem at the state hospital in Denver's County.
Mental illness, of course at that time was not very well understood and treatments were still in their infancy.
Psychiatric hospitals like this were seen as sort of a dumping ground for embarrassing family members rather then a place that they could go to actually get help.
Right.
The conditions were pretty abysmal.
People have to sleep on the floor, some times, without blankets or even clothes.
It was really not a fun place to be stuck in.
Could you tell us about
Arthur Friedkin?
His story is probably the most infamous about this hospital.
Sure..!  I figured that you're gonna ask me that.
Friedkin was a
Harvard trained neurologist who was head physician here from 1937 to 1948.
He had gain some notoriety because of his work in experimental brain surgery.
He was a major advocate of the lobotomy, under Friedkin supervision there were about 140 lobotomies.
On August 15, 1948, six patients broke out of their rooms and stabbed Friedkin in his office.
His body was found the next morning by a nurse.
Unfortunately, this event was completely overshadowed by the death of David Bruce, the famous baseball player.
It's a crazy story!
So Morgan, in your honest opinion.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I don't know.
But if they do exist, well, this would be a good place to go looking for them.
The traffic was busy today, so...
Didn't take us too long, it was about hour drive, something like that.
- Oh God!
- "Death awaits."
- I guess we'll find out.
- That is so lame!
Ah, this will taking a bit, this old ancient lock here.
I don't even think we should use this.
- You know, it's really cheesy dude.
- Yeah! I don't like that.
Slow motion, music behind it.
Everything's creepy.
- Okay.. come on.
- Good. Here we go.
Okay, come on in.
Oh my God!
So this is the main entrance to the building here.
Nice!
Yes!
Oh, ho ho, man!
And if you were family member, you have to check-in at the reception over there.
- This is creepy as shit!
- This is so insane.
Are you getting all this?
Get everything!
I want to do camera shots of all of this.
Hey you down there.
No smoking, uh.
Can you take that outside?  Don't even bother inside, please.  Fire exit.
I'm here with Kenny Sandavol.
Resident caretaker, for the past 8 years.
Kenny!  Would you say that this place is haunted?
Well, I've never done this before.
So, should I talk to you or to the camera?
Yeah..  Don't.
This isn't...
Well, I don't know if I believe in ghost or spirits or anything like that.
But in my time here I've seen some pretty weird stuff.
You know, especially working late night you hear all these old pipes and the building sort of make noises and...
Well, it's really hard to put your finger on it.  But...
I get the sense that, I'm not alone.
Lets go check it out!
Aha.
Okay.
Uh, like this hallways go on forever.
Yup!
It's hard to believe this place used to house thousands of insane people.
There were thousands.
Seem to have darkness and it's still day time.
- So where is the power socket?
- You scared?
Ah, there's a few newer lines you can plug into.
I'll will show you where those are.
Hey guys!  If you think it's dark now, wait till tonight.
Cause none of these lights work, it'll get very dark.
- So you guys see this window here?
- Yeah!
I lock it up real good in night come back in morning, some times this thing's wide open.
What!
Yeah, I can't figure it out.
Its like a... something is trying to get out or something.
Its a definite paranormal hotspot.
- How is it?
- Perfect.
How is this supposed to help people if their stuffed in these tiny rooms.
- Oh my God!
- This is officially fucked!
- Is this real?
- Yup, this is totally real.
The guy who lived here was in here for quite a few years and this is what he did.
He spent his time writing on the walls.
So this is the actual patiented room here?
An actual patient was in here.
Really?
I don't know whether he was right to the end, but he was here for a long time.
Very creepy.
- What the fuck!?  Kenny!
- This is great!
Oh man, the acoustics are shit in here.
Supposedly a patient, a young girl, killed herself in here.
- What?
- Right here?
- A patient killed herself, right here?
- Yes, slit her wrists in this tub.
Oh God, that's so sad.
People say they've heard the sound of rustling water coming out of this room, but I've never heard any thing like that.
Where are we going next then?
Ah, we gonna go down to the service tunnels.
Can't wait to see all this.
You on it?
- Oh Kenny!
- This is exactly what I was looking for!
These service tunnels connect all the buildings.
There's about a quarter mile of them.
It's like a maze down here.
You could easily get lost.
One day, I was down here walking over to the East wing, and the air got real cold.
It was so still.  I felt like someone was watching me.
Very eerie feeling.
- What?  What?
- It's just my shadow. Sorry.
This is Garry Crawford.
Crawford Contracting.
He was hired here, quite some time ago, to do some work?
Is that right?
Back in 93, yeah.  The state was gonna try and do some renovation here but eventually they shit-can the idea.
Oh shit, I'm sorry!
- You want me not to swear?
- Yeah, that would be better.
Anyway, me and my guys came in here for about two weeks.
And you experienced some supernatural phenomenon?
Well, we were off to start, some of the guys were hearing what they thought were weird noises and...
And there were some tools disappearing over night,
I thought it was looters, but
I never saw anybody, so...
- There was an accident?
- Yeah...
One of my guys on a ladder, in fact, he was pulling some old wood just over there.
And he swears that something pushed him off the ladder.
He took a hard fall.
Banged up his knee, and he quit!
Well! that doesn't sound like a residual haunting.
Its sounds like an intelligent haunting.
A residual haunting is thought to be like an echo from the past, continuing to loop over and over again.
An intelligent haunting is actually a spirit that interacts and has intention.
There are many reports of people having been pushed, scratched and even thrown.
It's rare but it does happen.
So, you both have spent a lot of time out here?
Yeah, all in high school with bunch of kids used to come down here and just... you know, for hang out.
And you saw something here?
Yes.
We were actually right here.
Here.  Making out or whatever... and
I looked up and I swear to God.
I swear to God that I saw someone right at the end of the hall there.
- He was wearing a... like a white...
- Like a hospital gown?
Yeah, like a white hospital gown.
And he had shaved head. Yeah.
Full spectral apparition.
Why don't we... why don't we grab an interview with gardener look like?
As long as the lights doesn't...
Excuse me! Excuse me sir!
Excuse me.
I'm shooting a TV show here.
Just wondering if you want to do a quick interview with us.
I am standing here with the resident gardener, Javier Ortega.
Javier, have you ever noticed anything strange around the building?
No.  Not really.
What do you mean?
Well, have you heard any weird noises or seen any ghostly activity?
I just start to working here.
Just started working.
That's great.
TC can you... ?
Just cut for a sec?
Okay, how about you make something up for the camera?
Pretend you saw something?
Just...
- I got to get go on to work!
- Okay. Okay.
Wait! Wait, wait... No, no just wait.
Do you have any of the  petty cash or...?
Hey Javier, how does 20 bucks sound?
I am standing here with the resident gardener, Javier Ortega.
Javier, have you ever seen anything strange in the past
10 years of working here?
Yeah, I saw a ghost.
Over here.
It was really scary.
A ghost on the exterior of the building.  Unbelievable.
This is really a paranormal hotspot unlike anything, we've ever shot at before.
On three, two, one ...
Because of this location's massive size and scope, I've called in psychic medium
Houston Grey to assist in the investigation.
Houston!
Are you sensing anything?
Oh wow!  Wow!  Oh, there's such an incredible energy here!
It's like hundreds of voices all talking at once.
The sound is deafening!
There is something else.
I..I... There's something else here.
It's... like a dark spirit.
It might even possibly be a demon.
Now we have got to be extremely cautious tonight, Lance.
We do not want to be messing with something like this, at all.
This is it!
Houston, are you feeling anything?
Yeah.
I'm sensing deep well of sadness in here.
A profound sadness.
I see a patient.
A female patient.
A girl. There is water, red... red water.
Blood. Blood.  She died right in here.
She slit her wrists in the bathtub.
The caretaker said a girl killed herself right here.
Houston!
That's incredible.
The spirit is still with us.
Cut it.
Yeah!
- Okay!  Was that too much?
- No.
Come on.
How was it guys?
No, no, no. That was great.
That sounded very real.
Hey Lance!
How do you feel about Show 6?
Feeling good.
It's a good location.
Do you think we're actually going to see some ghosts this time?
Oh yeah! Hundreds of them.
I'm sure.
Wow!  Maybe you try to sound a little less skeptical.
I mean, it would be great.
But if we don't, then... you know whatever, we just want to make sure we can get some good scares. That's all.
Oh!  Oh, oh hey, TC!
Uh, you want to get a nice crime lab shot?
Dude, the ground's slippery.
Okay, this is creepy as shit.
I am getting out of here.
Alright, we are about to check in with our resident Grave Encounters tech wizard, Matt.
Matt!  Why don't you walk us through some of what are you're doing here?
I've set up ten static cameras around the hotspots of ghost activity.
So they record constantly the tape.
They are also recording to a backup hard drive.
And everything gets wirelessly transmitted back to my computer.
So I'll know what's happening all the time.
Real quick Matt!
Why don't you walk to us through what some of the equipment is for?
This is an EMF meter.
And what this does is it records electrostatic and electromagnetic fields in the air.
So the basic idea is that man-made or human EMF fields will remain stable.
While fields caused by paranormal activity will produce spikes in the reading.
Infrared thermometer.
Okay, it's the same idea as the EMF, only it's used to detect drops in air temperature.
Ghosts are believed to cause dramatic drop offs in air temperature, known in the paranormal community as cold spots.
Testing one, two, three ...
- This is a simple analog audio recorder.
- All right.
- It's used to capture EVPs.
- Oh, now real quick ...
For the audience at home, explain, what an EVP is...
EVP is Electronic Voice Phenomena
This thing will actually pick up sounds that the human ear cannot detect.
So when we play it back, if we hear something, we'll know that something out there is trying to communicate with us.
Okay. This is my favorite.
This is a Geiger counter.
You just turn the sound right here, and you're good to go.
I mean, look at this!
This is freaking bad ass!
That's bad ass.
Listen!, I can guarantee you, that if there is anything paranormal, anything freaky happening in this joint, we gonna catch it.
Alright folks, we're about to initiate lock down.
My friend Kenny here, the building's care taker will be doing us the honor of sealing us inside.
Kenny, thanks very much, man!
See you at 6 am.
Okay, 6 am sharp.
Good luck!
I am a demon.
A demon child.
I can't wait to see you there in the morning.
Yeah, you see, we got to spend the night with these two freaks.
What are you doing?
I'm on with Kenny.
Dude, did you lock the door?
What do you mean?  It's great for the show, man.  Don't worry about it.
What if I have to get more equipment after that?
All right!
This is the real deal folks!
This is the by far the biggest location we have ever investigated and the most dangerous.
Now, I want to put emphasis on fact that this facility was built very much like a prison.
All the windows are barred.
We literally could not get out of here if we wanted to.
We are trapped inside, until Kenny the caretaker comes to get us in the morning.
We will be working in pitch dark.
Capturing everything on three night vision capable cameras.
Along with the static cams that Matt set up for us on our hotspots.
All right everyone! If  you are ready, it's time to have some
Grave Encounters!
Okay, we're now roaming the vast darkness of the hallways of the institute.
Hallways that have been abandoned for more than 50 years.
We are in search of spirits that are unsettled in life and possibly unsettled in the afterlife.
- I sense down here is cold
- Cold is right.
This is the hallway where the apparition of the patient with the shaved head, was seen floating down at the end of the hallway.
Sasha, Let's do that EVP.
Is there somebody with us?
Are you a patient here?
- Did you use to live in the hospital?
- Play back.
"Is there somebody with us?"
"Are you a patient here?"
"Did you use to live in the hospital?"
There's nothing.
- All right.  One sec...
- I feel like it just sort of a ...
Spirit, you have nothing to fear from us.
If you are here, show yourself!
I think it's getting colder as we go on.  It's drawing us this way.
It wants us to go this way.
If there's a spirit here with us, we want you to give us a sign.
Open the window!
Even just a nudge.
I'm going to use, this still camera to try to capture paranormal anomalies.
They're not usually seen by the human eye.
It's better known as spirit photography.
One more.
We gonna have to wait for the pictures to be developed.
If there is a ghost behind me, we won't know until later.
Are you the one, who wrote on these walls?
Or are you trying to communicate?
Why don't you try and communicate with me now?
If the patient who killed herself in this room, in this very tub, is here now, make yourself known.
I'm really creeped out in here.
Alright, camera 2 and 4 have...
Temperature readings are nominal.
Guys, why do I have to be the one that sits here by myself?
Houston, do you feel anything?
I'm feeling a very, very negative dark energy here.
And not just a single energy, a lot of energy.  Many, many spirits.
If there are any spirits down here, please show yourselves!
Make a noise for us.
As we said before, it seems like these tunnels just go on forever.
It stinks in here too.
- Oh, did you hear that?
- I heard that too.
- Okay, we just heard something.
- What the fuck was that?
I don't know, come here.
Over this way. You guys, follow me.
- How is it? Where is it coming from?
- I think this door.
Just down over here.
You want to open this?
You can swing your camera around and get in?
Yeah, not really, but...
God damn it!
Oh!
Whoa... yucks!
- Rats!
- Are you frigging crazy?
- No way, man!
- Really?
It's not that big of a deal.
Awesome!
- You're such a dork!
- You see, its not funny!
This place is as haunted as a ...
It really is scary.
I honestly scared, okay so...
Sitting in a graveyard, an inflamed guy is murdering his wife...
Could this be residual ectoplasmic material discovered first by the
Grave Encounters team?
Okay, I think we should just do one more walk-through upstairs.
Give me some V camera shots down the hallways, get some of that... floaty hallway stuff.
Like we did at Plain View Mansion.
Yeah exactly, exactly...
Stuff we can cut into.
Lance you are going to love me.
Mmm...
Shit!
How do you like this?
Hold on, hold on, hold on...
Yes, my dear?
Come on.  Why was she crying on the phone?
Hi pumpkin!
What's this mummy tells me, you're afraid of monsters under the bed?
Didn't we have this conversation?
Monsters aren't real, baby.
They aren't real.
Even they were real, they wouldn't want to come to our house.
Because you know Daddy will take care of them for you.
Tell mummy I gave you permission to lay in bed with her tonight.
Your Daddy won't be home until morning.
We'll go out for pizza tomorrow, ok?
Dad will be home soon.
Bye bye.
God damn! Its cold in here.
What the fuck was that!
Guys, cut this shit!
I'm not fucking playing!
Ain't the fucking time to do this shit!
What the fuck!
Hey!
Where are you guys?
Maybe it was the wind or something.
That's solid, alright.  Nothing short of a tornado is gonna move that.
How much do you think that weighs?
Hey TC, how did it move?
Was it like...?
Whatever it was, it scared the crap out of me, right.
I have to change my shorts and I'm getting out of here.
Can you explain it?
I...
I just told you, man.  I was taping, I turned around like this.
The thing just closed.
And I...
- I thought it was you guys, at first, right?
- You were taping it?
You taped?
I told you that in the first place.
If you guys weren't so busy like...
- Is it you frigging have it on the tape?
- You got it on tape?
Check that out!
- Boy!
- Oh my God!
Okay, that's freaky.
Yeah.
I accept your apology,
I accept your apology.
I cannot believe that you saw that!
Incredible footage you saw just moments ago, was captured by cameramen TC.
This door directly behind me slammed on its own.
Now there's no drafts in room, there's no windows that could have caused it to slam on its own.
We are now going to attempt to make contact.
Is there someone here with us?
Please make a noise.
Tap on something.
Feel free to slam the door like you did on TC just moments ago.
Feel free to slam it as hard as you like.
So go ahead.
Slam it!
Right wow, please!
Give us a sign!
Spirit, I invoke you to make an appearance.  Take out...
With... If there is anyone here, give us a sign...  Fuck!
Fuck!  I thought we were actually going to have something here.
What the fuck was that?
Jesus Christ!
It was here...
That was really fucking scary guys.
That came from right... right here!
Shit, I can't see anything.
Do you hear that?
What's that?
- What?
- Oh shit...
Holy shit!
Hello!
- What's if...?
- This is really fucked up guys.
- I'm going to...
- What the fuck is that guys?
- What the fuck is that?
- What's up there?
Matt.  Hey Matt, is there anybody up on Four?
Anybody up on any floor above us?
No.
What the hell is going on?
Obviously, somebody is fucking around if they know we're shooting here.
Why are we going up here last?
Because this is where the sound came from.  Jesus Christ.
Hello!
Is there anybody up here?
If someone's here, why are they fucking with us?
Listen! If there's anybody here trying to fuck with us, its not funny!
Alright, we'll call the police!
We have a right to be here!
We have a permit, and you don't!
- Hey, can you lower your fucking voice.
- I'm just trying to talk!
- You guys, you guys quiet.
Well, this is something real.
I gonna do EVP.
What's your name?
What do you want?
Are you in the room with us?
Where are you?
Come on, Sasha.
Play back
"What's your name?"
"What do you want?"
"Are you in the room with us?"
"Where are you?"
What's that sound?
No, no, no.  What is that?
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?
- Did you get that?
- Did you see that?
- No way!
- I got it on tape
Sasha!
Please, please, can't even find you there ... at the lobby!
I need to get out of here.
I need to get out of here right now.
I can't even view.
What are you thinking?
- Just wait a second.
- Wait for what?
We've been shooting this show for what?  Five episodes?
We've never seen anything like that before.
I don’t even care!  And I just need to get the fuck out of here!
Fine!  Houston, you take her down there and you come right back, okay?
- I think I'll stay down there as well.
No, no.
I need another face on camera.
Lance, I'm really thinking,
I don't think I can do this. I...
Be a fucking professional will you?
Alright.  Stay in the character.
We are on to something here.
Alright!
Don't do this to me
Alright, I'll come back.
Come on sweetheart.
No no no!  TC you're with me, man. Come on.
Are you kidding me?
Did you see that shit?
We don't get that kind of thing again man!  You're fucking making millions!
Just moments ago in this very hallway we captured undeniable proof of the paranormal.
Sasha was terrified to the bone because a ghost actually manipulated her hair.
We're going to try to attempt to make contact now.
To the Spirit, who dwells in the hallway we implore you to show us a sign.
Manifest yourself!
Please!
If you're still with us... give us a sign.
Make a noise or... manipulate my hair.
Do you see anything?
No.  Wait.  Give me the light... no, nothing.
- Don't even think of asking ...
- We are a team.
I think its gone.
You what I think, honestly.
I think it had its fun...
It played this little prank and it took off.  Maybe that's all they do...
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know.
Come on, you some fucking in here, do something.
You did it before, do it again.
Are you fucking scared?
Jesus Christ.
Fuck, forget it.
Lance!  Its gone ...
Its left us ...
I'm sensing that it's toying with us.
-  Couldn't have said more...
- Shit.  Give it a rest.
Could we go home now?
Lance, there are people who chase Bigfoot, look for Loch Ness their whole lives.
All right.
TC, what time is it?
It's 4:40.
So let's go home, man.
When did that guy say he's coming again?
Hey you guys, I think we have enough footage.
Why don't we just pack up everything and we get out of here.
- Okay! So we are...
- Yay... We're going home.
I think it's just right up ahead.
Are you sure?
Yeah, this is it.
This is it.
I don't think so.
- This is this the way, right?
- Oh for the look! Fuck, it's a dead end.
Guys.
You see, that's not... that's not the way. Wait...
Come on, come on!
- TC roll on this, man.
- Roll on what?
- After we're lost?
- We're not lost.
We're not lost, we came this way ...
And Matt?  Hey Matt, you are...
Are you at the station?
Matt! We're lost in here, man.
We need...
We need some info.
Why the fuck isn't he answering?
- I'm not going that way TC!
- Why not?
Because I'm going back over here.
Yeah.  We... if we stay in one direction, then we're gonna get there okay?
It's what?
North?
In there and around the corner, is where the bathtub was, you know where the girl killed herself.
Hey, we've been this way before, we've been this way before TC.
I'm not trying to fight with you.  Just explain to me when we saw this tub again.
Because this is not the same fucking tub.  I know it's not.
- TC, come on get up, man.
- You said 6 o'clock?
- Are you gonna sleep there?
- Is Kenny coming at 6 o'clock?
- I'm not waiting.
- Yeah, he's coming at 6 o'clock.
I'm not waiting for you man.
I'm not waiting.
Where the hell were you guys?  You all hear me calling you on the walkie?
Yeah, you know what?
Two tin cans with a fucking string on it would have been better.
- We got lost.
- Something wrong with your walkie-talkies?
No!  I was calling you guys!
You didn't hear me on radio?
No, I didn't hear shit.
You didn't hear me?
No!
Because this is why you don't lock the door, Lance, by the way.
Lance!
Case and point why you don't lock the fucking door?
Holy shit!
What did you see?
Which one is it?
- That... fuck the hair.
- Oh yeah it is.
That is fuck!
Alright, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna dump this quick on the computer.
No no no, Matt, we don't have time for that.
Grab all the static cams.
Get it all together. You know...
Guys, let's all get up and start packing this stuff up.
Get it ready for when Kenny comes.
- Can somebody help me, please?
- No no no no.
I need everybody down here, Matt. I'm sorry man.
It's gonna cut it's side, I know.
- You got your radio?
- Yeah, I got it right here.
- Sure it works?
- Hope so.
 - Did you hear that?
- Yeah, we got it.
 - Okay, I'll Be right back, okay?
- Alright man.
 Don't fucking leave without me.
Okay, it's time to get the fuck out of here.
Hey Lance, are you there, man?
Hey guys, I got something up here.
Hello!
Hey Lance!
Hello!
Guys, quit fucking around!
It is now approaching morning.
We haven't seen any activity in well over an hour.
For Grave Encounters,
I'm Lance Preston.
- One more time...?
- No, we don't have...
One more time.
For Grave Encounters,
I'm Lance Preston.
That's all I got.
Fucking, I why I hate this anyhow...
It doesn't really matter, guys.
You know why?
We can always pick this up tomorrow, there'll be sunlight, we'd be better too.
- Fine.
- You know what I mean?
That’s good idea.
Where is Matt, anyway?
What the fuck is taking him so long?
Matt?
Matt?
Are you there?
- Lance! Lance!
- Matt?
Radio's not working before.
Guys, I know this sounds really stupid but...
I'm the last person who wants to go walking through these halls again.
But it's pitch black, and Matt could have fallen and hurt himself for real.
She's right, he could be hurt.
- Guys, we have to go look for him.
- Okay...
Alright, this is ridiculous, alright.
Let's go fucking look for him
TC grab the camera.
Sasha grab the camera.
For what?
Listen!  If we gonna go and do this, then we might as well film everything.
 - Thanks for your help, man.
- Hey!
It's no fun hanging around here I can tell you...!
By myself..!
Jesus Christ.
Matt!
- Matt!
- Matt!
Matt...!
- Matt!
- Matt!
- Matt, where are you, man?
- Where the fuck are you?
Matt!
- What the fuck?
- Shit.
Matt!
Hey Matt!
Why is this shit everywhere?
Matt!
Matt!
Matt!
- Matt!
- Matt!
Alright, alright, alright.
He wouldn't just leave equipment like this?
No, he wouldn't
It looks like he was just packing it up anyway.
He's got to be... He's got to be down one of this ways.
TC, you go that way,
Sasha and I'll go this way
Why will we do this?
That is a terrible idea.
He's got to be here, he wouldn't just leave
- his stuff here alright...
- Why don't we split up as a ...?
Sasha comes with me.
TC just check that way, okay?
This looks like the living room after a fight with my girl!
Matt, where are you man?
I want to go home, this is enough!
Freaking us out! Man.
Look for the cigarette butts...!
Come on, Matt!
This is stupid.. Dude!
I don't understand this guy.
Matt!
Come on, dude!
You're gonna get me a shit with my girl!
It's late!
Fuck man.
You better be dead or dying, bro.
Matt!  I ain't playing with you right now!  Where the fuck you at?
What the?!
Matt?
Lance!  Sasha!
- Shit!
- What happened, what happened?
- Don't, don't
- What, what?
Are you serious man?
Are you okay?
- What?
- Just lift me
Lift me.
- I swear to God, someone ...
- What?
- I got pushed..
- What?
Something fucking pushed me, man.
I was looking for fucking Matt.
I was looking downstairs, sort of fucking pushed me, I almost broke my fucking neck, dude.
I looked back and there was nothing there.
These things have been messing with us, alright, all night.
We're getting fucking by them.
- Call him! Call Kenny! The only way...
- Okay! Okay!
- Told you. Just call him.
- Jesus, I'm calling Kenny alright?
Jesus Christ.
Fucking signal.
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!
Fucking piece of shit.
Alright, I can't get a signal.
Oh God...!
- Let me try.
- Alright, check the phones, guys.
Perfect.
Fucking perfect.
What the hell are you doing TC?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Come here and fucking help me.
- You can't break down the door, TC!
- Just watch!
No!  We're gonna cause damage to the property.
We're going to be liable for it, alright.
Just be patient.  Wait!
The guys fucking coming.
See hey!  Come on man!
What the fuck!
That's coming out of your rate.
Does it look like I give a fuck about the fucking rate.
The fuck can...
I'm tired of this shit.
I want to go home
I want to go back to the fucking hotel and get some fucking sleep.
Hey, you know what?
Your boy is a no show, okay.
What is he?
An hour late?
So just put the fucking camera...
- Christ!
- Fine. Alright.
- Help me.
- Alright, hang on.
- Do you want my help?
- No, Houston, we're fine with you there.
On three okay?
One, two, three...
One, two, three!
What the hell.
No, this is the fucking lobby!
This is the fucking lobby.
- We came in this way, right?
- Hell, yeah!
Yeah, this is the... this is the lobby, yeah.
This can't be right.
This is impossible.
- This is the way we... this is where we put our shit, right?
- Yeah.
This is the way we... this is how we brought the stuff in.
- This doesn't make sense right?
- I don't understand, shit...
This doesn't make any sense...
This is the way we came in.
If there's another hallway, it doesn't... I don't know ...
It must have got turned around here.
It must be on the other side of the building or something.
Lance!
Lance!
Are those are same doors?
I'm getting sick of this, guys.
Oh, ho ho ho, yes!
Houston, take that.
Take that, please.
Hey, hey, watch your leg, man.
Watch your leg!
Give me your fucking hand, you sit and watch.  Isn't that fucking...
All right, all right, all right.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
One, two, three!
What is that fucking same...?
What the fuck is going on?
Maybe it's just an exit down to... like this way to the emergency exit.
Houston shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.
This, you see?
Now we'll get out.
Give me a fucking second?
- Oh fuck!
- Hey, watch it. Watch yourself.
- We're fucking trapped in here, man!
- No, we're not.
Hey, let's get a tool.
We can try pry the bars out.
I, oh, I got a fucking tool-belt.
Oh, shit, I forgot.
- It's in the van. Outside!
- Oh, fuck!
- You know, how we're locked out?
- We got nothing?
Fucking brilliant idea.
Alright, obviously not all the fucking windows have bars on them.
Yeah, they do.
No, no!  The one upstairs!  That one didn’t have any bars on it!  Right?
We just got to find it.
Who knows?
The shit's off...
- Come on.
- What time is it, Sasha?
- You got to be fucking kidding.
- Fuck!
- I told you that fucking ...begin at 8:34.
I have an audition tomorrow!
No one cares about you and your career inside ... the baggage studio shit!
- Oh! My work's not as important as yours?
- Guys, let me think for a second!
This doesn’t make any sense, it's fucked up!
I checked the sunrise times last night.
What's your fucking point?
Should've been bright by 7:45.
But it's still night out.
- The sun is still not up ...
- Didn't make any sense!
It's not fucking funny man..!
Shut up!
This no make no sense.
- I need to get out of this building! Please!
- Somebody help us!
Ok ok ok ok.  Here. Listen, listen.  Well, let's just try to be rational here, ok?
This is an old building, right?
It's an old building, so it has all sorts of energy fields, things and stuff going on, either could be electrical anomaly, that has actually moved our clock faster, something so that you know, it's actually not really 8.30 but only 6.30.
That would explain why it's so dark out.
And why why... you know,
Kenny hasn't shown up.
- Electric anomaly?
- It's fucking retarded!
Why did you come to believe your fucking come from idea comes from rational?
This isn't one of your fucking audition for some science fiction movie!
Because nothing else is rational here okay.
It is rational as anything else.
I checked my cell phone...
And... it says the time is 1.12.
It's 1:12 pm.
I don’t think that's right.
But I guess it cant be... right?
I don't know.
Everyone's very tired.
So they are just taking a nap and taking a break.
And we're going to just wait until Kenny shows up.
I don't know what the hell is giving me this.
Doesn't makes any sense.
I haven't slept for like 20 hours.
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna set my alarm for an hour and I'll take a nap.
Houston, what's your problem?
- It's not my problem!
- What the hell are you doing?
- What the hell happened?
- Oh my God!
Someone or something just broke our lights.
We are in the pitch dark.
All we have is our flash lights and our camera lights.
- Which you're wasting right now.
- I just checked my cell phone.
And it says it's 8 pm.
So, we slept for 7 hours.
TC went to get a sandwich and you gotta see this.
Lance!  It stinks...
Close that shit.
What are you...?
Close the fucking thing.. man!
All our food is like that, but we still have lots of bottled water so...
I don't know, we should be okay.
Why don't we try going down through the tunnels?
Kenny said that the tunnels connect all the buildings together, then maybe we can find a way out through one of the other buildings.
Are you looking and see the Great Wall of China?
I'm not going from the goddamn tunnels.
If our lights go out we're fucked.
Eh listen. Remember when you told me to do the time lapse outside.
- Mm hm.
- I saw a fire escape.
If we get on the roof, probably climb down and get the fuck out.
Well.  What's the verdict?
Shall we stay in here or ...
I don't care what we do.
Let's just get the fuck out of here!
I really... I don't want to be here anymore.
- Ok ok.  So everybody, we're gonna do this.  Everybody wants to do all this?
- To the roof!
- Alright, fine!
Let's pack up all the gear and let's go.
- Give me some of the light, guys. Come on.
- Here here here.  Sorry.
- We go there?
- Let's wait!
- Lance?
- No, no, no!
TC you knew where we were going, you said.
I didn't say anything!
Don't put it on me.
No, you said you know where the ladder was.
No, I said there was a ladder.
- I didn't tell you where.
- Okay. But is it this end?
It doesn't matter.
Was it here?
- I saw from the outside.
- Okay. Got just a ...?
I can't do this, guys!
- Look!
- What the fuck is that?
- Hello! Someone up here?
- We just keep on...
TC!  Is this there?
Don't ask me questions.
Is it staircase or not?
Hey listen, just keep the light on in front of me.
Move, move move!
Get the fuck out of my way!
Get the fuck out of my way!
- Wait guys!
- Slow Down.
What the fuck, you guys?
Yes, yes.
The fuck, yeah!
No fucking way!
Check this, check this!
That can't be right.
It's fucking solid.
Does it look new?  Does it look like it's been there for a while?
This doesn't make any sense.
Would you get the fucking camera out of my face!
- What do you think?
- I don't know, I don't know.
We just left the stair well that was completely sealed off at the top!
I going to document everything, when we get out of this.
People are coming to see this.
Look at this!  Okay we came up
4 floors from the stairs, right?
That puts us on the 4th floor.
We came from this way, and we've gotta at least be here, right?
- Are you sure?
- I don't know ...
- TC, you said one of this floors...
- Lance! Lance! Lance!
What, what?
- What are these?  You were here?
- No, we know we went up a number of stairs!
This has not changed.
This is not opened.
This is not the change.
This says we're on the 1st floor.
Another we keep in mind though.
- Initially this is where we came in, right?
- I know, I know, but...
- TC, are you filming this?
- Yeah, yes, that's fucked up.
What what what?  What the fuck is that?  Did you hear that?
- Did you guys hear that?
- Oh shit!  What is that?
- Shit! Stop.
- Matt? Matt?
Holy shit!  Over here.
From this foot.  Over here.
Matt! Matt! Matt!
Matt, is that you?
He's not in here.
He's not in here!
Whoa whoa whoa!
That just fucking move?!
Let's get out of here!
Now we wandered the building to take a look for another stairwell.
And... I don't know.
We couldn't find one.
This building is a fucking maze!
It's like TC said it's...
It's likes just keeps changing all around us.
We still haven't been able to find Matt.
I don't know if he's okay.
At least he's not seeing that same shit as we are!
We are all tired, and we are hungry.
So we gonna try to sleep again.
We're going to sleep in shifts this time so somebody can always be at watch.
- TC, you're rolling now?
- Yeah.
We just woke up and you guys got to see this!
Turn the fucking camera off!
Sasha!  Come on.
We gotta to document this okay.
- I'm sorry. People got to see this.
- No, no!
- Careful! Careful!
- I'm so sorry.
Sasha, we got to tape this down.
This is unheard of.
There is no way someone came in here and did that without us noticing.
- Dude cut it!  Cut this.
- My pleasure.
Matt!
I swear I heard.
Matt!
Hello!
Matt?
See?  There, there. Fucking heard him, I told you guys.
He's alive!
Matt! Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
I'm freezing!
Just tell us where you are.
We'll come and get you..
Matt!
Shit!
He's not there anymore.
We have to find him.
How do we gonna find him?
We can't even find our way to the front door!
Houston, he can't be far.
Those walkie-talkies are a piece of shit.
Listen, how do we even know its him?
Matt!
Are you in here?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!
- Fuck!
Matt!  We hear you buddy!
Where are you?
Sasha, try all the frequencies.
It doesn't have that much range.
How far is did you say you thought it was?
I don't know how far, the specifications...
- So what did you guess? 200-300-400?
- 200 yards to get a clear signal.
Maybe 300... before it starts crapping out.  Okay.
Stay together, come on.
That's a dead end!
Dead end.
- Matt!
- Hey Matt!
- Matt.
- Matt!
Where the fuck are you?
Listen guys.  This is fucking pointless, alright?
If we were to find it, he would... the range of it no matter what...
Holy shit!
- What was that?
- That was Matt!
What are you doing, man?
<I>What the fuck... ?
Lance! Lance! Lance...
Do fucking something!
Lance! Lance!
Hey you.
Hey!
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
Turn off the light!
Light off!
Did you see her fucking face?
Shut your fucking mouth!
Did you see her fucking face?
What's happening here?
What is it wrong with me?
Oh my God!
Oh shit! Oh shit!
Shit, we lost him!
Oh shit, we fucking lost Houston!
Matt!
Guys!
Guys!
Sasha!
TC!
Lance!
Is there anybody here?
TC!
Help! Help!
Help! Please!
Houston's gone. then we tried Matt on radio but he doesn't respond.
What the fuck is that?
We keep hearing crazy shit like that all around us.
Fuck!
I don't think how long it's going to last.
We are not alone in here anymore.
How is the name on it?
How the fuck is my fucking name on it?
First, I get scratches on my back and now ...
What the fuck!
When we woke up, we had this you got to see this ...
Fuck you. What the fuck, what the fucking wrong with me, you fucking asshole?
- I didn't fucking mean to, okay?
- You fucking...!
- I didn't fucking mean to.
- You bring us up, you asshole.
What the fuck does this mean?
It means we're fucked.
Okay! That's what it fucking means
This is insane.
Fucking insane!
- Don't look in it!
- Why, what wrong with looking like this?
What the fuck?
Enough, man!
There's something over there.
Here!  Enough is enough!
We keep walking in what feels like circles and we... we still can't find
Matt and Houston.
- Will you stop!
- Will you stop what?
Are you kidding me?
Fucking whole shit, we're not making 'em!
- Fucking TV show.
- I'm just documenting stuff, okay?
People will gonna want to see this!
Matt and Houston are gone?
We need to concentrate on getting out of here and finding them.
And you're just still doing this whole shit!
Okay you guys, just stay together, okay?
- I'm just really...
- Don't worry about it.
- Is that the fastest you have to run?
- Let's go!
Jesus Christ! Come on!
Keep up!
No, no, no, no! Get up!
Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on!
- I can't, I can't!
- Yes, you can.
Come on, you've got to get up.
You got to get up.
Come on.  I know!  I know!  You got to be strong. You got to listen, ok?
You got to get up.
We got to keep going!
What, what?
Just get over here!
What are you waiting for?
Come in!
Look!
Oh shit!  Is it Matt?
That's him, right?
I don't know, man.
Matt!  Hey!
Matt, get up!
Matt, Matt!
Just shut the fucking room!
Hey Matt?
- Hey hey hey. Stop fucking around!
- Matt, are you okay?
The patient exhibits acute... disorder linked to childhood phobia.
Jesus Christ!
- Get him the fuck up!
- Let's go! Go!
Come on, get him up!  Pull him over and let's get the fuck out of this room now.
Get him in here.
Come on.
Put him down on bed, put him down there.
- You see anything?
- No, its good.
Hey! Where you been?
Where did you get those clothes?
- Well, for God's sake, talk to us!
- You guys, look at his wrist.
Matt? Matt?
Where did you get this?
Where did you get all this shit?
Matt!  What did they do to you?
What did you see?
Nothing is bullshit!
Look, where have you been?
You probably know a way out of here.
You got to know a way out of here.
Of course there's a way out.
We can all leave, as soon as we're better.
What?  What do you mean
"when we're better"?
What the fuck does that mean?
Well, I wasn't ready yet.
Progress is slow.  But the patient is responding to treatment.
This guy is out of his mind.  He is like high or something. He talks of...
- TC!   Shut up!
- You don't need to tell me fucking, fuck!
Don't be sad
Everything is gonna be okay.
He'll help you too.
Oh my God!
- Okay TC!  Go check that door!
- I already did.
Check it!  Not... if something gets in here man.
Just make sure there's nothing in here!
We found Matt.
He's all fucked up.
There's somebody I think is here.
What?
- It's okay.
- What are you doing?
I don't feel good.
I think there's something wrong with me.
Yeah, you feel really warm.
I think you got fever.
- Here.  Have a sip.
- Thank you.
- Get some sleep.
- I can't sleep.
Thank God.
We'll be able to sleep again.
- Come on!
- Come on.
Come on...!
Run!
Run!
Come on, get in!
Come on now!
- Did you see anything?
- What is that?
There's blood in the tub!
There's blood in the tub!
- What?
- Come on!
...going far away.
Fuck!
Matt.  Matt!
- What he is doing?
- TC!  Get him away from the tub.
Come on Matt!
TC!  What the hell is he doing?
I don't fucking know!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Help me!
Help me!
Flip the tub!
- He is gone!
- He is gone?
He's fucking gone!
He just disappeared!
Oh fuck!
No, no!
It is an elevator!
Open it!
Open it!
Open it!
Open it!
It's an elevator shaft.
If we can get down to the tunnels, we could use them to get one of the other buildings.
Go!
Fuck, fuck!
Listen! Listen to me.
I believe it's safer in there, okay.
I'm going to get some... and then we're getting out of here. Okay?
Stay here with him, man. Okay?
What the hell is that?
Jesus!
Is that a tongue?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Bring the light, bring it here.
There is a ladder. We can use it.
We can use the ladder to head down.
How are we going to get Matt?
I'm going to reach across, and then you help me with Matt, okay?
Get back there!
Stay back.
Lance! Lance!
Where the hell is the night vision button?
There it is!
He's gone?
I don't know, he just disappeared.
Go on. Go on.
He may come back. Go on.
- Where the hell is he?
- Matt!
Jesus!  He jumped!
He jumped!
Come on!
Easy.
I got you.
You're okay.
Go on.
It's okay.
It's the tunnels!
We made it to the tunnels.
Come on.
I can't.
I can't leave him.
Come on, Sasha!
Get out of there.
Remember what Kenny said.
They connect the buildings, right!
You need to do this with me.
- I can't do this alone! Okay?
- Okay.
Stay close to me.
Let's go this way.
It can't be too far.
Okay, we can.
Come on...
No! We should hit a...
We should hit a junction by now.
It should have been right around here!
What the fuck!
I can't...
Wait a second!
Sash, you okay?
Oh Jesus!
I want my mom!
It's a...
It's day.
What day is today?
I don't even know what day it is.
We spent all day walking in one direction and... we didn't get anywhere.
I figured counting me in the wrong...
Sasha not going to make it.
Who's there?
Who is that?
Sasha?
Sasha, where are you?
Where are you?
Sash!
Sasha!
Shit!
Damn it!
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'm running low on battery power.
Now, I only turn on light only when I need to, now.
But I don't really need the light anymore!
I just keep walking straight.
I could walk in the dark for hours.
It's kind of like a game.
How long can you go?
Anybody watching ...
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you, guys!
This is for you.
Don't you hear in these walls?
Don't you hear?
Don't you hear anything?
Come and get me!
Just woke up and...
I don't know how long
I was sleeping but...
There is a door!
You have to see it!
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
Oh God!
Jesus! Jesus!
Its...
It's impossible!
Shit! Shit!
No! No!
I'm not crazy!
I'm not crazy!
No! No! No!
I'm so much better now!
I can finally go home!
For Grave Encounters.
I'm Lance Preston.
Signing off!
Defy reason.
Defy everything you know.
Welcome to Fright Night.
Onstage at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Welcome back.
In the northern Las Vegas suburb of Hillcrest Bluffs today, a woman leaving a grocery store says a man came up to her and tried to bite her.
He was scared off by the security guard.
If you've seen or witnessed anything similar...
Really? Really?
I'm going to take you apart.
You watch me.
Watch me take you apart.
You're done. You're done.
Nothing doing, huh?
This thing has got no ambition.
It's got no huevos.
Doris, do you want some help with the trash?
Oh, I got it. Thanks.
All right. Good to see you, Char-Char.
You're getting big.
Hey, kid. Don't leer at the neighbors.
She's the one that put the word on her butt.
I'm just reading it.
Is he ever going to move that dumpster?
Oh, Mom, come on.
You got to get over it.
Attitude.
You've been stressed or something.
Amy?
Amy is good.
Hasn't dumped me yet, so...
Getting what you want can be stressful.
Especially when you're not used to getting it. More to lose.
You reading those books again?
The Power of Whatever-the-Hell?
Because they're definitely not working.
And neither is this bike.
Still tripping out over some guy's box.
It's an eyesore.
I'm trying to get people to move in, not join the legions leaving town.
- I like that word. "Legions."
- Hello.
Can I get some help here?
- When the Perrys lived there...
- When the Perrys lived there, they were the greatest neighbors ever, but they moved.
I thought you were happy their house finally sold.
He's not digging a pool, so where did all this concrete come from?
That's a very good question.
Maybe you should spy on him some more and find out.
He's 13 feet from our house.
That's not spying.
It's merely observing.
- Hi, Mrs. Brewster.
- Hey, honey. Hi, girls.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Ed called again.
- Yeah?
I'm tired of making excuses for you, Charley.
If you don't want to talk to him, just tell him.
Kind of defeats the purpose.
- Still can't get the bike started?
- No faith.
So you don't need a ride?
Amy!
Amy! Oh, my God.
Hey!
- Charley?
- Yeah.
- Guess what?
- What?
- Guess what? We are on time.
- Oh, good.
- You stress too much.
- No, I don't.
Yeah, you do.
You do your worried thing.
- What's my "worried thing"?
- Your worried thing.
I don't have a worried thing.
I never make that face.
All the time.
- Ladies.
- Dudes. Looking good.
Seriously? A mochaccino?
You can't ride with the girls any more.
I mean, you let them brush your hair,
My Pretty Pony?
Chuck's secure.
Nice, man. Nice kicks.
- Puce.
- Fuck, yeah.
I have track after school.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Amy, Amy.
About the prom. I was going to ask you.
I just kind of figured it was a go.
You, me, ill-fitting tuxedo.
The whole thing, you know?
No. Nobody goes to the dance in senior year.
Okay. Yeah, I knew that.
- It's so not cool.
- I know.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
Did you find a freaking genie lamp, man?
Make a sacrifice to the hot-ass gods?
How do you get that?
Just game, man.
Rock-solid game.
- He doesn't even have a car.
- Seriously.
- Ben Wegener?
- Here.
Nick Straley?
Nick?
- Courtney Frank?
- Here.
Adam Johnson?
Adam?
- Steve Danton?
- Here.
- Matt Hofstetler?
- Yo.
- Ellen Mclntosh?
- Here, Ms. Granada.
Samuel Silverman?
Holy crap, man. How did you get that?
She's hard up, man.
Dude, I think Ed's going to talk to us.
Hey, can I get a minute?
Just the two of you? That's sweet!
Now he can school you in the ways of geek-douchery.
Nice. Don't you have some sluts to go fuck?
Actually, yeah, I do.
It's important, Brewster.
What's up, Ed?
You know Adam's missing, right?
What do you mean, Adam's missing?
I keep trying him.
No texts, no phone calls, nothing.
I don't know if you were paying attention at roll call, but he's not the only one that's gone.
Kids aren't coming to school.
That happens all the time.
What do you want me to do about it?
Just meet me at his house after school.
We'll check around and see if he's okay.
I can't. I'm sorry. I'm busy.
I don't think you understand what I'm telling you. Adam's gone.
Do we really have to do this here?
Wow. Am I supposed to not even speak to you any more?
- Be quiet. Don't spaz out.
- "Don't spaz out."
You don't want me to spaz out?
Oh, my God! It's so horrible!
Crossing the streams! Will high school as we know it cease to exist?
Okay. You want me to go tell your pals how well we really know each other?
The LEGO contests, the Farscape conventions,
- the costumes?
- Please stop.
Or how about that one time you took my Stretch Armstrong, so you could tie it around your balls and jerk off for an hour?
- Stop.
- Then be my backup.
Okay, fine. Adam's after school.
Don't be late.
I'd really like Stretch back, by the way.
You know what I want for dinner?
You realize you're eating right now, right?
You just forced me to get you a smoothie so big that they named a planet after it.
It's true. I'm insatiable.
You are.
What was that for?
Nothing.
I'm so sorry to take up your time.
I really appreciate your help.
Is my mom flirting?
Hey, Charley, I'm at Adam's house, and it's really weird, because you're not here.
Remember those videos of us back in the day?
Adam, you, and I dressed in tights?
You don't want your new pals seeing you in that, do you? All right.
So, not a pool?
What's the work you're doing?
Foundation problems.
I had to rip up half the basement.
Oh, these houses were practically built overnight.
It never surprises me when they come apart.
This is the third time this thing has broken.
Done. Just needed a new stem.
Jerry, this is my son, Charley, and his...
I don't know. Do we say "girlfriend"?
Hi, I'm Amy.
Hey, Jerry.
Nice to meet you.
So, Jerry is our new neighbor at the Perry place.
- And he's handy.
- No kidding.
I'm sorry about the mess, Charley.
I was just saying to your mom
I'll have the dumpster gone tomorrow.
It doesn't bother me. My mom was...
Jerry does night construction on the Strip.
Oh.
You play ball.
I'm always looking for a pickup game.
Yeah, no, I do. Definitely.
- I do.
- It's more of a collector thing, the shoes.
He's obsessed.
They sleep on sidewalks to get them.
- I play, though.
- It takes a real man to wear puce.
I like them.
So, I'd invite you guys inside, but it's a mess.
- I've been meaning to.
- Be neighborly.
A drink. Something.
Soon, okay?
Yeah, you bet.
And thank you so much for the help.
It's the least I could do.
My God. Why did you blow him off?
A guy that good-looking still single?
Bad bet. He is a player.
Nice, Mom, breaking it down.
I've had enough man troubles.
I am not getting suckered again.
Oh, wow.
I got to go.
- What?
- I'll call you later. Okay?
- Now?
- Dinner's on.
- That's fine. I'll eat after.
- Charley!
- Are you okay?
- Okay, see you, guys.
Dude, where the hell have you been?
- You said after school.
- I meant right after. This is dusk.
- Do you know what that means?
- No, I have no idea.
- Let me consult my pocket dictionary.
- Nice.
Hello? Anybody home?
Nope.
This is nuts.
I really hate to be the one to tell you this, but that guy, your neighbor, he's a vampire, man.
- My neighbor? Next door?
- Yeah.
Jerry. I just met him.
Okay. Jerry.
That is a terrible vampire name. Jerry?
I didn't name him, man.
I'm just reporting the facts.
Dude.
Hello?
Adam?
Yo. It's Ed.
- Jesus.
- I feel stupid. It's a cardboard cut-out.
Nice.
- They're not here, dude.
- It's not just them, okay? Listen to me.
I saw this thing on channel 13 where there was this lady who escaped an attacker that tried to bite her.
Why are you walking like that?
All right. Listen.
Adam and I graphed out all the attacks, all the disappearances.
- Whole families, gone.
- That happens all the time.
Nobody lives in Vegas, they just pass through.
You live in Vegas.
That's you right there in the center, next to his house and Perry's old place.
His windows are completely blacked out.
Lots of people have blacked-out windows.
They work on the Strip at night, sleep during the day.
Which is why it's the perfect plan. It fits!
What? That Jerry's a Dracula?
No. Dracula is one specific vampire.
I'm telling you...
Dude, I know what you're telling me.
I'm making fun of you. I'm mocking you.
- Awesome.
- You read way too much Twilight.
That's fiction. This is real.
He's a real monster, and he's not brooding, or lovesick, or noble.
He's the fucking shark from Jaws.
He kills, he feeds, and he doesn't stop until everybody around him is dead.
And I seriously am so angry you think I read Twilight.
Ed? Ed?
You haven't asked him in yet, have you?
Because obviously he can't get in without an invitation.
I know you know that.
- You're on drugs, dude.
- No, well... Yeah.
But I thought you'd take my word on this, man.
I have hard evidence at home.
Okay.
All right. Listen.
We have to stake him in his nest, okay?
Me and you. But not now. It's too dark.
We should go during the day.
That's what I read on Peter Vincent's website.
- The magician?
- Yeah.
The magician in the bandana and the leather pants and...
- Yes.
...tattoos and...
Yes. He's the master of dark forces.
He studies vampire methodology.
What else do you need?
- Wow.
- Wow.
Can we just pretend for one minute that you're not a complete douchebag?
Evil, this was fun when we were eight.
- Try 16.
- Whatever, man!
Point is I grew up.
If you don't want to, that's fine, but don't get an attitude because
I'd rather have a life than make shit up.
I get it. You're so cool, Brewster.
Go ahead and join your Clark High early peakers,
- and that includes your girlfriend.
- Shut up.
She's undeniably doable, yes, I will give you that, but we used to make fun of her and her friends.
- She's a skank. We used to make fun...
- Shut up!
Adam's gone and you act like you don't give a shit!
What the fuck happened to you?
We were inseparable.
You know when my life started to get better?
When I stopped being friends with you.
What a fucking asshole.
Goddamn.
- Why are you on my street, bro?
- Sorry. I'm really sorry about that.
You tracked your nerd juice all the way down it.
Really? Looks like I tracked some nerd juice on your face there.
Oh, yeah? Do I still got some?
Still there?
Okay.
Just hit me. Really,
I don't have time for this.
Seriously?
Jesus, I just gave you a fucking invitation to hit me.
You just gave me an invitation...
Oh!
You better run, boy!
I'm coming! You better run!
Unbelievable.
Shit!
You back the fuck up! I'm armed!
I know how to use this thing!
Hello! Please!
Please, somebody let me in!
Someone's after me right now!
Please!
Help me! God damn it!
Forget it, Jerry. No invitation.
You can't get in.
Oh, shit.
Abandoned. I thought you did your homework.
You've been watching me.
I've been watching you.
It seems fair.
Shit, shit.
That looked like it hurt.
You bit off more than you can chew.
It's too late. I told people what you are.
You've been made!
And you think anyone's actually going to believe you.
Don't play that crap, don't play that mind shit with me.
I'm serious. Try me!
Okay.
You say you're glad you're different.
- Get back!
- How can you be in a place like this?
These people, even your best friend,
- you're nothing to him now.
- No.
You were born for this.
And you know it.
It's a gift.
Good on his word.
Kid Comeback!
Gladiator Man!
Squid Man!
- Come at me if you dare!
- I dare!
What can you do now, Squid Man?
- Hey, you.
- Is Charley up yet?
You try. My voice seems to be on some frequency he can't hear.
Charley!
The world is Kid Comeback's!
No, you're already dead.
No, you're already dead.
Coming!
- Eden Miller?
- Here.
Ed Lee?
Edward Lee?
- Zach Taylor?
- Here.
- Beth Tepper?
- Here.
Charley!
- Hey, Mrs. Lee.
- What a nice surprise. Come in.
Rick, Charley's here.
- This looks great.
- Thank you.
- Look at you, so handsome!
- No. You look great.
Ed said you really sprouted up.
Look at you. How's it going?
Ed's going to be so sorry he missed you.
- Oh, he's not here?
- No, he leaves early.
Do you mind if I run upstairs and...
There's just a book that we need.
Of course. Make yourself at home.
- Right up there.
- Nope, I remember.
Oh, man.
Peter Vincent.
Welcome to Fright...
Oh, Adam. Here he comes.
You see? You see what I'm saying?
He's a guy with a wheelbarrow.
The horror.
Don't be a dick.
You know what I'm trying to prove.
There. That's his truck.
Fuck! Fuck me! Oh, he didn't look.
That's him right there, Adam.
He does not show up on the video.
He is so nailed. So nailed.
- Hey, guy.
- Hey.
Guy.
- You could really do me a solid.
- What's that?
I got a girl on her way over for a beer, and I'm all out of beer.
It's... Sucks.
Set me up. I'll pay you back two times.
A sixer for your mom and one for you.
- What do you say?
- Yeah.
Yeah, let me do that.
Right now. I'll go right now and check what we got in the fridge.
Okay.
- Cool. Just give me a second.
- Cool.
Let me just see what she's got.
Mom's kind of a...
Kind of a light domestic kind of a mother.
Nice kitchen.
Good cabinet work.
Thanks.
You cool with Budweiser?
Yeah, that works. Yeah.
- Oh, shit.
- Can I help you with that?
No! No, no.
I got it.
I just... Yeah, I got it.
Sorry it's not a sixer.
This girl tonight, she's a handful.
You know?
Women who look a certain way, they...
They need to be managed.
It's true.
Your dad ducked out on you?
Your mom, she didn't exactly say, but there's a kind of neglect.
Gives off a scent.
You don't mind my saying, you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid.
The two of you, alone.
And your girl, Amy, she's ripe.
I bet there's a line of guys dying to pluck that. Your mom, too.
You don't see it. Maybe you do, but she's putting it out.
It's on you to look out for them.
You up for that, guy?
- I think I can manage.
- Good.
Because there are a lot of bad people out there, Charley.
Everyone's got to look after his own business.
Thanks for the beers.
Hey.
Where have you been?
You told me to meet you here an hour ago.
Hello?
Hey, are you all right?
Are you all right? Everything good?
Yep.
- Why shouldn't it be?
- No, it should.
Did you ever read this?
- No.
- It's really good.
It's kind of sexy, actually, in like, frustrated, unconsummated sort of way.
Like us, you mean.
Mmm-hmm. Kind of makes it hotter.
- Am I boring you?
- No, I'm just tired. Sorry.
Okay. That's all right.
We can fix that.
Do you want to get under the covers?
Right now? Really?
Yeah, why not?
We could just give it a go, and...
Please believe me, there is nothing
I would rather be doing right now than getting under the covers with you.
Okay.
Charley, don't be nervous.
It's okay.
I'm not nervous, I'm cool.
I'm good.
Did you hear that?
Sorry I'm late.
Doris. Oh, shit.
Shit.
What? He's hot, your neighbor's a stripper.
They were bound to find each other.
Go-go dancer.
No. You take away two tiny pieces of cloth, she is a stripper.
Rude.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, he saw us!
Whoa! Maybe.
It's not a big deal.
It's a huge deal, okay? Very big deal.
He looked at us and he was pissed!
Okay, Charley, if you're not into this, can you just tell me?
Because you don't have to do me any favors.
Amy, I'm not doing you any favors.
Of course I'm into this. Of course.
I don't trust that guy.
You're so stupid, Charley.
- I'm going.
- Oh, come on. I'm sorry.
No, I'm going. I'm going to leave you to look out the window at the neighbors and have fun with your neighborhood watch thing!
Oh, shit.
A woman screaming?
You bet she screamed.
"You bet I made her scream." Jeez.
- Keep it down a bit.
- Sure, absolutely.
Unbelievable.
Come on. Come on.
There it is.
Doris?
Doris?
Shit.
Fuck!
Doris?
Doris.
It's Charley.
Charley? Charley!
Oh, God! Get me out of here!
I am. I am.
Hurry!
Shit! Shit!
Oh, no, he's coming back!
He's coming back! No!
No, please.
Please don't. Please.
No, please don't. Please don't.
Fuck!
Oh, God!
Good. I got you. I got you.
That's the first thing you wear for Joe when you get your new boobies.
I want to get breast implants, but my husband, he's more of an ass guy, and he's very happy with my boobies, with my minus-As.
Thank you.
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.
Hey, you're going to be late.
The hours you keep.
It's like living with a vampire.
Mom...
That guy Jerry, next door.
Under no circumstances is he invited into our house, all right? He's dangerous.
- I think I can handle myself.
- Mom, please, I'm serious.
Don't acknowledge him.
Don't talk to him, and at night, please stay inside.
Why? Because he's dangerous?
I can't answer a million questions right now. Will you just trust me?
Charley, stop! I'm your mom, not some ridiculous woman.
I'm sorry, I can't do this right now.
I can't answer a million things right now.
I don't understand. Charley!
Hey.
You weren't in class.
What are you working on?
Porn.
Good. I thought it was something creepy.
You okay?
- I should probably...
- Get back to your porn?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.
Get back, demons!
No!
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop! Cut it!
Come on! What the fuck, people?
Fire. She's supposed to be on fire, not dribbling fucking smoke.
She keeps moving the squib.
Hey, I do not.
But Mr. Fireman here almost nearly burned off my extensions last time.
Bugger this. Look!
Get me some professionals, all right?
Mr. Vincent?
Mr. Vincent?
Hi, I'm from the Vegas Sun.
We had an appointment today.
I don't think so.
Speak to my guy.
No, we did. I'm doing that article,
"Vampires: Separating Myth
From Fact."
Do you want a quote?
That's a shit idea for an article.
Look, please...
Please, I need your expertise and you're the man on this stuff, so...
I fucked her.
Filthy!
So, is this, what, your first assignment or something?
Yeah.
I'm going to pop your cherry.
Ginger! Bring him upstairs.
You got 10 minutes.
Wow! This is all his stuff?
He started collecting tarots and Ouijas.
Gateway stuff.
Now scholars, they call him for answers.
Those books, the forgotten texts, the Agrippa. He's read them all.
No, don't touch anything.
He's PMS-y today.
Sensitive little girl.
Over there, that's haunted antiques.
Cursed stuff!
And that's Pete's honorary degree from LVSU.
But he got it off the Internet.
Fuck!
The one and only.
- Midori me.
- Midori yourself, douchebag.
- Fuck you!
- Asswipe.
Come on in. Come on.
It looks like pee, but I'm hooked.
- Do you want some?
- I'm good, thank you.
No? Too much for you?
Do you want a Shirley Temple?
Uh...
Sit down.
So,
I'm the expert for your vampire thing?
They're all the rage.
Leather, it doesn't breathe.
Fucking rashes are fucking killing me.
Shoot.
Right. Well...
Look, I know your show...
I know your show is an illusion.
Meaning bullshit?
- Yeah, fair enough.
- But say I wanted to kill a vampire.
- Yeah, sorry. Go on.
- How would I go about doing that?
You want to know how to kill a vampire?
Seriously?
Yeah, kill a vampire.
Well, let's think.
You got fire, beheading.
You can make him a big garlicky omelet.
Or go traditional.
Stake through the heart. Bam!
Cool. So that stuff really works?
Well, maybe not the omelet.
How the fuck should I know?
I don't know. You have all this stuff, and you are "Peter Vincent: Vampire..."
- I don't know. I'm not sure.
- I read books.
You think I'm hanging out with Dracula?
And the Easter bunny? Fuck off.
I'm sorry, but I have a personal interest in this.
I think one of them got my friend.
What? "One of them," meaning a vampire?
Yeah. Jerry. He lives next door to me.
Jerry? Jerry the vampire?
Do you think I don't know how this sounds?
Two days ago I would have laughed in my face, but it's really happening.
I am so far down the rabbit hole.
I was in his house, or his lair, or whatever, and I got these pictures.
- If you just look at them.
- Okay. Get out.
- No, please.
- You're a nut job. Ginger!
I'm not! I know what I saw.
No, you don't. Illusion, remember?
People see what they want to see. This is...
You don't collect this stuff.
You don't have all this stuff if you don't believe, and I promise you,
I can take you to him.
I can show you what you've been waiting for...
What, in Clark County,
Nevada? Ginger!
That's a hotbed of supernatural activity.
It is, though. It's genius.
It's a transient population. People work all night, they sleep all day!
Get this loser out of my sight, please.
- Stop!
- Whoa!
He got my friend already!
I am not crazy.
I'm not. I don't want to know this shit.
Please, just look at these pictures.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Time to go, doll. Come on.
Dude, is that Charley?
What the fuck is he doing?
It's paranoia.
Once I thought I was being chased by carrots with machetes.
- I know!
- Whatever, man.
You guys are both ruining my high.
Oh, shit! All right, ditch the weed. I'm cool.
- Hey, guy.
- Yeah?
- Fuck...
- Oh, fuck.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
The whole house looks like that show.
Dark Shadows.
Yeah. It's a gag for Amy.
Long story.
Don't, Mom, don't!
Don't open it!
How did you get in here?
- It was unlocked.
- Oh, my God.
Mom, please, I told you to lock the door!
Okay!
You are flipping out.
You're acting all weird.
You're blowing everything off.
Is that a stake?
No. Maybe.
Look.
Even if you are losing it, you do not get to blow me off.
You don't go from something to nothing overnight.
You're not nothing to me, Charley, so whatever is happening,
I would like you to talk to me, to tell me what is going on.
Oh, man. Amy, look...
I need you to just forget about me, okay?
I'm not going to let you get hurt.
I'm sorry.
What? How?
How am I going to get hurt?
- Stay there.
- I got it.
No! Don't answer it.
Please don't answer it.
This is ridiculous, Charley.
Jane, it's Jerry from next door.
Don't answer the door.
This is my house.
I will answer the door if I want to.
But, Mom!
Jane, I need to talk to you.
Just hold on!
Now. Your son is harassing me.
- Charley, what is going on?
- Listen to me.
Whatever he says, he's going to try to slip...
Jane, he broke into my house.
Is that true?
I'd rather not take this to the authorities, but I will. I have no choice.
He's sick! He's deluded.
Please.
Go get the authorities!
- Shit!
- What?
Wow. What is he doing?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not good.
We're all right as long as we stay inside because obviously he can't get in without an invitation.
- Like a vampire.
- Yeah, really, like a vampire.
This is the joke for Amy, right?
I can't believe you got Jerry to go along with it.
Take this.
Okay.
Vampire protection.
I don't think this is funny.
Shit.
Hey.
What the fuck is he doing to my yard?
What's that?
I don't need an invitation if there's no house.
Come on. Come on!
Get in! I'll drive.
Jesus Christ, Charley, what the hell is going on?
Mom, just go!
Just gun it! Just go!
- Is everybody okay?
- Are you all right?
Nobody's hurt?
Look out!
Are you all right?
Amy, are you okay? You okay?
- Jesus!
- Mom, keep driving!
What the hell is going on?
This is seriously not okay, Charley!
Who the fuck is this guy?
Mom, I told you, he's a fucking vampire!
- Enough with the vampires!
- Really!
Let's just calm down.
I'm going to call the police.
- I don't have any service.
- I do. No.
I hate the fucking desert!
Now I have a psycho next door.
Oh, shit. Charley, is this him?
Who is this?
Oh, man. Damn it.
- Oh, my God.
- No.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.
God! What the fuck!
What is he doing?
Charley, he's coming around the side.
Keep going. Keep going.
Jesus Christ.
Shit. Look out!
What does he want?
- Oh, no. What do I do?
- Hit him.
- What?
- Hit him.
- Mom, just hit him!
- Charley, no!
Just fucking hit him!
- Don't stop.
- Holy shit!
- Just drive. Don't stop!
- Oh, my God.
- Do you see him?
- No.
- Did I kill him?
- Hopefully.
Mom.
Oh, God.
No! That's his fucked-up vampire hand.
Now do you believe me?
Shit!
Keep driving, Mom!
Oh, my God!
Charley, fucking kick him!
Shit!
Get away from me!
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Where is he? Where did he go?
- Stay in the car.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
No! Stay in the car!
You stop in the middle of the road, you got a taillight out.
No, Charley!
Hey!
Charley!
Hey.
Please go. It'll be all right.
Go. Take her and go!
Amy, take her and go!
Catch you later.
I repel you with the power of Christ the Lord.
Do you? Really?
That's a mighty big cross you got there, Charley.
The question is, do you have faith?
Get back!
Not the cross.
Not the cross, Charley.
Come here.
You ever get a stake in the chest, Charley?
I have. It hurts.
But they missed the heart.
It's right here, Charley.
Easy measurement.
You shouldn't have been so nosy.
- Mom!
- Mrs. Brewster!
Her head.
- You got her?
- Yeah.
- Charley...
- Hang on!
Good show tonight, right, babycakes?
You were late again on "The Devil's Torture Chamber."
I have something for you. Look.
You were early again in the bedroom.
Fuck you!
I will fuck myself.
Someone's got to do it.
We won't be up all night.
Honestly, it's really not a party.
Sit tight. We might have a few more questions for you.
- Okay.
- Mom?
I love you. Bye.
They only asked a couple of questions.
We should be okay.
I don't know. I think maybe you should've said something to the police.
Like what? "This vampire moved in, borrowed a six-pack of Bud,
"ate a stripper and blew up our house because we wouldn't invite him inside."
Last time I called the cops, they nearly all went to Chili's together.
Okay.
This is my fault.
You didn't make any of it happen.
Ed came to me, and I turned my back on him.
How were you supposed to believe him?
I mean, he begged me.
I mean, he really...
And he was my best friend.
I know, but, Charley, people, they change.
Yeah, and I just changed into a dick.
I figured my dweeb past wasn't really going to be very popular with the ladies, so I...
Oh. Are you trying to say this is my fault?
I just really wanted you to like me, that's all.
Charley,
I knew you were a dweeb.
Do you think I wanted some dude like Mark? Or Ben?
No.
I like you. Because you're different.
It didn't hurt that your skin cleared up.
Thanks.
- Hello?
- I can help you.
My place in one hour.
We're going to see the Peter Vincent?
It's underwhelming, believe me, but he's what we've got.
Mom's very religious.
I'll tell you what I know, but that's it.
Right?
Don't expect me to join your little Scooby gang. Sit down.
Whatever you got, I'll take it.
That insignia you showed me.
It's a species that originated in the Mediterranean.
They nest in the earth.
And they kill slowly.
They keep their victims alive for days.
Snackers.
And they turn everyone?
They change them into...
Yeah, I got it.
They're tribal by nature.
He could be trying to turn them all.
Replenish his ranks.
How do we kill these guys?
This tribe.
You two? You don't.
It's a strong breed.
You're going to need an army.
Hang on. Sorry. Sorry.
- Hello!
- Mr. Vincent?
- Yes!
- You have a delivery.
All right. Send him up.
Ginger, we've got a delivery!
I'm watching my programme!
You get it!
You're TiVo-ing it, you lazy cow!
Come on!
Shit. Douchebag.
Hi, doll.
EBay. I order things late at night when I've had a few cocktails...
So, yeah, some nice stuff.
Wait a minute.
You get deliveries this late?
Yeah.
No. I don't know.
Oh, shit. No. You said that guy could come in. That's a...
An invitation, airhead.
Hey, Mr. Vincent, package for you.
Fuck!
One second, guys. Business call.
Hello. Oh, yeah.
No, I'm looking at them right now.
Yeah, come on up.
He's actually quite modern.
Jerry dispensed with all that "master" stuff.
Ed, if you have a problem, just keep it with me, okay?
Oh, do I got a problem.
You let him get to me.
You let him turn me into this.
Stay away, demon.
Is that itsy-bitsy little sticky for me?
It's a crucifixion nail.
It's lethal to you.
Yeah. That's old school. Nice!
You're going to have to get pretty close to use that thing, though.
Oh, no, you don't.
Come on! Let's go!
Holy shit!
You took my arm!
Are you enjoying your panic room, master of darkness?
God, you are such a pussy. I love it!
Come on!
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- Amy, listen to me.
There's more than one way out, and there's a million things to fight with.
We're going to be okay. All right?
- Yeah.
- Trust me. Come on.
Come on!
Damn it.
Give it up, Chuck.
If you hadn't turned out to be such a dick,
I might have tricked you out.
We could have rocked this evil shit together!
Sign in, please.
Sign in, all right?
Hey! I'm talking to you.
I need you to sign in.
No exceptions...
I expected more of a fight from you, Brewster.
Girl's made you lazy in the head.
Pussy will do that.
I can hear you breathing.
It's really fucking cool.
I can feel you.
I can taste you.
You're so...
Fuck!
Come on!
Not so fast, Chuck.
We got some catching up to do, my friend.
Amy, go. Amy, please go!
It's just you and me now, buddy.
Mano a mano.
Let's do this.
Nice weapon there, Squid Boy.
Ed...
Not going to do you much good, though, because I'm a goddamn killing machine.
Come on. It's like you're not even trying.
I'm so glad you're here.
Werewolves.
Vampires.
Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles.
It's hard to cut.
Is this weird for you?
Because I'm feeling really homo right about now.
Fuck!
Bimbo's got some juice.
Jerry's here.
Do it, Charley.
Charley, do it now!
It's okay, Charley. It's okay.
Come on. I found the stairs.
We have to go. Come on.
Come on.
Shit.
Come on.
Wait. He can't kill us, not in here.
Really? Look around. Do you think any of these people are going to notice?
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, God.
It's tequila mad T-shirts!
- Amy!
- Charley!
Amy!
Charley!
Amy!
Now that is what I'm talking about!
Can you help me? Please?
Charley's going to come.
He's gonna find me.
I'm counting on it.
You'll see. You just need a taste.
It could be like a dream.
Amy!
- How did you get in here?
- Listen, man! Listen to me!
He's dangerous. You have to help me.
That guy's going to kill her.
Yeah, she looks to be liking it, then.
No, man. Listen, you don't understand!
Attagirl.
- ID, then you can...
- I don't have ID! There's no time!
Amy! Amy!
Amy! No! No!
No! Amy!
Shit! How did you get in here?
Security is a little lax since everybody got their throat torn out.
You, too? Has he turned you?
Check your monitor, man.
I don't know if Amy's alive or dead or turned, but he got her.
I'm going to end him, or he's going to end me.
That's how it's going to be, and you're gonna come with me.
Don't you understand this yet?
There will be no fighting.
There will only be surviving.
- Maybe.
- Really?
You think if you live and we all die, you'll be able to get us out of your head?
No, I know I won't.
I never could after the first time.
So I told myself I made it up.
I was a kid. Figured it was easier to believe in monsters.
Made what up?
The vampire that killed my parents, but not me.
You think I collected all this stuff because it was bitching?
Come with me. We'll go in at dawn.
He's got to rest some time.
The only reason I survived the last time is because I had the sense to hide.
If you want to be a dead hero, good for you. I'm out.
You think I'm a coward.
I'm not. I'm a realist.
So you just bail on people.
Hey, I get it.
My dad was like that.
But I don't want to live till tomorrow if you're the kind of man I'm going to be.
Hang on. Wait.
Blessed by Saint Michael.
You kill your vampire with this, it's supposed to change his victims back.
Maybe you can still save your girlfriend.
If it's for real.
You got a plan?
There's no guarantee he'll be sleeping.
To stake him, you got to get close.
Torch him.
A vampire on fire is not thinking clearly.
If he's on fire, how do I get close enough to stake him?
Fuck.
I'm going to kill a vampire.
Good for you.
Amy! Amy!
- Amy! Amy!
- Charley!
- You all right?
- Hey. Yeah.
- Hang on. I'm going to get you out.
- Hurry.
Shit. Shit.
Amy! Amy?
- Fuck!
- Sorry.
I guess I don't want to be a man like me, either.
Let's kill something.
Floor trap. I use them all the time.
What do you think is down there?
There's only one way to find out.
You're going down?
See that? Like a great date.
You get me drunk, I'll try anything.
Peter. Peter.
Oh, shit.
I may not be drunk enough for this.
After you.
Help!
You know this is a trap, right?
I'm counting on it.
Fuck!
She's all yours.
Look at you, all grown up.
Welcome to Fright Night, for real!
Oh, fuck.
You've got your mother's eyes.
And your father's aim.
Better.
Fuck!
Amy!
Ow!
Really?
A pebble? That's it?
Oh, shit.
Fuck!
You know you should have saved me, Charley.
There's still time. All right?
He's inside me now.
Fucking eBay!
I'll be the best you ever had.
The only you ever had.
Charley, we could be together forever.
Shit!
- You missed.
- I know.
- How you holding up?
- Oh, fucking great.
- Mark?
- You're dead now, asshole.
What were you thinking, Charley?
That you were just going to walk in here with your little crossbow and put to bed 400 years of survival?
No, Charley. Not likely.
You smell that?
It's your fear.
It's intoxicating.
It's a very specific scent, Charley.
Amy's scent, now that was exquisite.
It's all gone now, Charley.
She's something, isn't she?
I have to thank you for bringing her to me.
Well, she makes me feel young again.
I'm smoking.
Yeah, you're turning.
You can't stay there forever, Charley.
The sun's got to go down, but we can wait.
That's rough.
Got a light?
That's your plan?
Actually, it's your plan.
Fuck.
Fuck you!
Charley! In the heart!
Charley? Charley, come on.
Come on, Charley!
Charley, come on.
Come on, come on.
Wake up. Wake up.
Come on, you little prick.
Charley!
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah.
Are you?
Yeah, I'm all right.
You little shit.
Next time you're going to use my plan, give me a heads-up first.
That was a fucked-up night.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
One second.
Hello?
It's me. Just checking in.
What are you up to?
Nothing, nothing.
- What are you doing?
- Just did a little shopping
- for the new house.
- Shopping? Nice.
Something actually just came up, and I have to go.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good. Are you all right?
Yeah, monster free.
Good. Monster free is good.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Okay, bye.
If you're naked,
I'm absolutely going to look.
Dude! Dude!
I know. Sorry. I left my phone.
I'm not looking. I promise. See?
I can't see a thing. All right.
That's it. I'm out of here.
It's all yours.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
That doesn't narrow it down.
There's, like, mini golf and sushi.
Carry on!
Will you promise me, now we'll finally be alone?
I promise.
- Promise?
- I promise, promise, promise.
Mr. Blackwood?
Sir?
Mr...
Mr. Blackwood, I'm sorry.
You did ring, sir?
Come down.
♪ I wandered today to the hill, Maggie
♪ The creek and the creaking old mill, Maggie
I'm so...
So very sorry.
I didn't see the steps.
They made me do it.
I didn't...
If I want to see my child again,
I must comply.
Mr. Blackwood.
Please understand.
♪ Are gone, Maggie
When you and I...
Precious teeth.
Beautiful teeth.
Ransom for my boy.
Yes.
♪ They say I'm feeble with age, Maggie
Daddy.
♪ My face is a well written page, Maggie ♪
I... brought you something more to eat.
Not children's teeth like you wanted, but please accept them... in exchange for him.
CREATURES: Children's teeth.
Oh, no, that's the best I could do.
And they're my own.
You see?
My own.
Please.
Give me back my son!
CREATURES: Yes, your son is down here.
Reach for him.
Son? Son!
Son!
Grab my hand!
We've now begun our descent into T. F. Green Airport.
Please return to your seat, make sure it is in...
She's landed.
What do you think?
Too much?
No, it's perfect.
Just like you.
There's my girl.
Sally?
Wow! Look how tall you are!
What are you,
17 now?
Dad, you know how old I am.
I know.
I'm being silly.
Hey.
Good morning, sir.
Thank you.
Come on.
Sally, this is Kim.
Kim, Sally.
Hi, Sally.
It's nice to meet you.
I love you.
I love you.
Thanks.
What about a picture?
You got your camera?
It's good to see you.
Good morning,
Rhode Island!
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
We've got fog this morning and a slight chance of a shower later on.
Smell that fresh air, kiddo?
Sure beats the smog of LA, huh?
I have to call
Mom now.
Just press one and the green.
Hi, you've called Joanne and the magical Sally! Leave us a message.
L.C. delivered the flooring.
If it rains,
I'm afraid it's gonna warp.
Well, just put it in the garage.
Sally, say hello to Mr. Harris.
Nice to meet you.
Come, take a look at the house.
Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris, would you give me a hand...
- How's it going?
- Good.
- When do you think you'll be finished?
- No problem.
Good, huh?
- It smells funny.
- You should've smelled it before.
They had moldy newspapers everywhere, and dead pigeons all over the floor and poop.
Lots of it.
It's Jacoby's office.
Mr. Jacoby.
Oh, hey, Michelle.
Sorry.
Uh, I don't know.
Hold on. I'll check.
You got the photographs?
I like to draw, too.
You work here?
No, Sally,
I live here.
I'm the interior designer.
Do you know what that is?
Of course you do.
You see all the animal paintings and friezes?
They're by Emerson Blackwood, a man who once lived here.
He was a very famous wildlife painter.
Hey, Sally, look.
You want to try?
What do you have there?
- I found it.
- That's mine.
It was my grandmother's.
When I was little, my mother gave it to me.
My mom gave me to my dad.
Sally?
You wanna see your room?
What do you think?
Kim and I worked really hard to get it ready.
Check this out.
It's pretty great, huh?
It looks better at night.
How long am I staying here?
What did your mother tell you?
She told me
I was coming to visit.
But then she packed all my clothes.
She didn't explain anything to you?
- No.
- Sally.
Your mother and I are worried about you.
She thinks that maybe you're, uh... feeling sad... and she thought that...
Well, we thought that... perhaps a... a change might... might be good for you and that you could come and live here with... with Kim and me... until we finish the work on the house and... and sell it.
And then, uh... we could move somewhere else and...
Sally? Come on.
Open the door.
Come on.
Let me in.
Are you going to marry her?
Uh... that's between
Kim and me.
Mom said you only liked her because she was young.
But she isn't.
She is old.
Sally.
Open the door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the door.
Sally, please, let's talk about this.
Look, I know...
I know it must be tough.
You had a long flight, and it's... it's strange being in a new house.
I wanna go to bed now.
Okay.
Don't forget to brush your teeth.
You'd be a terrible poker player.
You've been ironing that shirt for like, half-an-hour.
She sure didn't take to me.
I wouldn't take it personally.
She's like that with everybody.
Those pills she takes, what are they?
Adderall, I think.
Jesus.
That's her mother for you.
That woman medicated our dogs.
So, what about Jacoby?
Well, his assistant said he still hasn't looked at the new photographs yet.
- He's had them for a week.
- I know.
But we're still in the running, and he's still coming to the dinner.
- He should just give us the cover.
- Yes, he should.
He gave it to the Spencer restoration two years ago... and you have done miracles here.
We have done miracles here.
It's not all about me.
Thank you.
These are new?
- Yeah.
- Great.
Well, if we get the cover of Architectural Digest, we won't need to take out another bank loan, will we?
You know what your daughter told me today?
What?
She said your wife gave her to you.
Kids say all kinds of things they don't mean.
It couldn't have gone any worse today.
I feel like the evil stepmother.
The evil and very old stepmother.
Let's not forget the old part.
'Cause I was kinda thinking you were looking a little ancient.
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
The stuffed bear?
What was I thinking?
Oh, come on. It's great.
She likes it. I saw it in her room.
On her bed?
Well, above the bed.
Hanging by a noose.
That's okay. Nice sign of affection, I think.
Sally.
Her name is Sally.
Sally!
What do you think?
Yeah. Looks great.
Have you seen Sally?
Yeah, she's on the bench.
Sally!
It is not safe for you back here.
Hey. What's going on?
Everything okay?
Keep her out from the back of the house.
She could fall in.
We'd be in a hell of a mess.
I didn't do anything.
There's pits.
Old wells.
It's dangerous for a child.
Mr. Harris is right,
Sally. He knows.
His grandfather worked at the house.
- You shouldn't be back here.
- But I found a basement.
There is no basement.
Easy, Harris.
I'll take her. It's okay.
It's there!
It's right there!
You know there's a reason this house is called Fallen Mill.
The English had a mill here, and it fell into a sinkhole.
That's why most of the houses around here don't have basements.
This one does.
You may wanna check this out.
It's unsafe for a child.
Pull on that.
Look!
I told you it was here!
Can you believe this?
This is definitely hollow.
I'm gonna get some tools.
You sure you wanna do this now?
Of course!
You kidding?
We can fix this easy if we have to.
You may wanna step back.
Mr. Hurst, I...
There's a door in here.
Where did you put the old house keys?
They're in your junk drawer in the office.
Okay.
Have a look.
Oh, wow.
You be careful, Sally.
Okay?
Okay.
How the hell did we miss this?
That must be the garden window.
It's all of his paints and old colored pencils.
This is amazing.
Wow.
Alex, look at this.
Harris, did you know about this?
This place isn't safe.
Especially for kids.
It's okay.
I'll keep an eye on her.
This must be where Blackwood worked.
I found another door.
Look at these sketches.
It's an ash pit,
I think.
Yeah.
It's bolted shut.
These are incredible.
Okay.
Let's go, Sally.
Come on, Sally.
Let's go.
Sally, come on.
This must be like
King Tut's tomb for you.
Which is excatly why we shouldn't be touching anything.
This stuff must be valuable.
She's gone.
No, no, she will come back.
They always do.
Yes, they always do.
I don't think that's important, Alan.
No, I just need to make sure I get the paintings and furniture back in time for the dinner.
You told me you could.
Come on. How long have we known each other?
I'll write you a post-dated check.
Hold on.
It's either walnut or mahogany,
I think. Yeah.
Hey, there you are.
I thought maybe we could bake scones.
I promised Mrs. Underhill we wouldn't make too much of a mess.
No. That's all right.
What've you got there?
My doll.
And my drawing stuff.
Looks like it's just you and I baking scones today.
I made sandwiches for everyone.
Sally.
Open the grates!
Yes, yes, open the grates.
Set us free!
Set us free!
Who are you?
What do you look like?
We've been locked up for so long.
Set us free!
Come down. You'll see what it's like down here.
Wait a minute, will ya?
There's other children down here.
They're just like you.
Sally?
Sally.
What're you doing down here?
- I heard something.
- Rats, probably.
Come on, it's time for dinner.
It was a voice.
Really smart rats, then.
No! Listen.
Nothing.
Come on, let's go, kiddo.
I forgot my bag.
Well, hurry up.
Sally, now!
We can get this tomorrow.
We can't get the rest of these for two weeks.
What about the burnt umber?
It's much warmer, and we can get it for half he price.
You not hungry?
Sally?
Don't you like rice?
Mrs. Underhill made apple pie for dessert.
Apple pie has gluten, and Mommy says gluten is bad for my concentration.
Oh, come on.
You love apple pie.
We can worry about your concentration tomorrow.
Mommy says no gluten.
What's your mother filling your head with?
- How about some chocolate milk?
- No, no, no.
- I'll make something else.
- No. Hold on, hold on.
Sally, you need to eat this, or you can go to your room.
Okay?
Good night, Dad.
What?
Did that work on you when you were a kid?
She's testing us, Kim.
That's what kids do.
Who's the parent here?
Certainly not me.
I didn't... mean that.
No... You're right.
I'm not a parent.
- We talked about this, remember?
- No, you told me about this, Alex.
I'm not sure I'm ready to be anybody's mother.
- Oh, come on.
- I had a hard enough time... getting over my own childhood... to have to... deal with somebody else's.
Listen, will you help me out with this, please?
I realize this is terrible timing, but I don't have a choice.
I can't...
I can't just send her back.
You know, that's not what I'm asking you to do.
Apple pie.
Thanks.
- Hello?
- Hi, Alex, it's Joanne.
- Hi, Joanne.
- Can I speak to Sally?
- No, you can't.
- Why not?
Because she's asleep.
We're 3 hours ahead, remember?
What were you thinking not telling her... she was gonna be living here?
You and I had a conversation.
I asked you if you wanted me to tell her.
Don't do this every time I have...
You're the one who wanted her here.
I love you. I love you.
Did... did you just speak to me?
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
The light, it hurts us.
Yeah. Turn out the light.
I love you.
Turn out the light.
We want to be friends.
Where's my doll?
With us. With us.
Sally's doll is with us.
Who are you?
We're your friends.
Friends?
Where?
Come down to the basement...
- and play with us.
- Where are you?
What are you?
Hungry.
Hungry.
Very hungry.
I have food.
Let me see you.
I won't hurt you,
I promise.
Sally?
- What you doing under there?
- I'm looking for my doll.
Looking for what?
I'm looking for my doll.
Oh.
Well, uh...
Oh.
How about, the...
Teddy instead?
- No.
- I love you.
That's all right.
- Did you lose a tooth?
- That's not mine.
- I found it.
- You found it?
What?
Here in the house?
Yeah.
Come on.
Can I call Mommy now?
No, it's too late.
She's probably asleep.
I don't think you should keep this.
It's not very sanitary.
What about this light?
Should I...
Leave it on, please.
All right, well, sleep well.
Oh, Sally, would you do me a favor?
Would you try to, maybe, be friends with Kim?
- Yes.
- Thanks, kiddo.
Kim, have you seen my razor?
We have to leave in five minutes.
- Yeah. You seen my razor?
- Here, take mine.
Five minutes.
My dress.
Sally. I wanna talk to you downstairs right now.
I cannot believe you cut up Kim's clothes.
- I didn't do it.
- Sally...
- I didn't do anything.
- Sally...
- I swear.
- Stop lying.
It was a horrible thing to do.
And it was dangerous.
You could've cut yourself.
What did you use, my razor?
Let me see your hands.
- It's mine.
- What is this?
Where'd you get this?
- Let me go home.
- You can't go home.
Just let me go home.
I'm sorry about this.
She's never done anything like this before.
She's obviously very angry about something.
Alex, that is not anger.
That is fear.
We need to go.
Mrs. Underhill,
Kim and I have an appointment at the historical society.
We'll be back this afternoon.
Sally, we're going out.
You listen to Mrs. Underhill and do what she says.
And you think about what you need to say to Kim, okay?
Are you there?
Did you cut
Kim's clothes?
Do you have my dad's razor?
You have to tell me the truth.
If you wanna be friends.
I won't be angry.
Sally's not angry.
They're angry.
No, I'm not angry.
They don't want to...
But we do.
Come down here, Sally.
Come down and play.
You said you were hungry.
Do you like raisins?
We said we liked them.
See? Delicious.
Delicious. Yeah.
So delicious.
Did you do something bad?
You have to answer if you wanna be friends.
Yes, friend.
Sally?
What're you doing down here in the dark?
Were you talking to someone?
Is there someone here with you?
No. I'm all alone.
There's nobody here.
Why don't you go help
Mrs. Underhill make lunch?
Go on.
Off you go now.
That's right. Up those steps!
Quick as you can, now!
Harris. You old fool.
I swear.
I didn't tell them anything!
No.
No, please!
Get away!
I had an accident!
Call for help!
Oh.
Don't look.
I could hear screams down there.
- Noises.
- Did you see anything?
He asked me to leave the cellar.
It was so dark in there, he must have stumbled.
- Oh, Mr. Hurst, thank God!
- What happened?
- Are you William Harris' employer?
- Yeah.
There's been an accident.
Are you okay?
Where is Sally?
I'm sorry.
She saw him.
I tried to cover her eyes, and I was too late.
- Where is she?
- She's in the garden.
Oh, I am sorry!
Sally?
Hi.
Are you scared?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Is Mr. Harris gonna die?
No, Sally.
He is going to be okay.
Can I show you something?
This is my favorite part of the house.
Blackwood loved nature.
He imported these fish from Japan.
And so did we.
They're called Koi.
They're considered magical.
Badgers can spot them against the mud at the bottom... because of their bright colors.
So what makes them special... is also what makes them vulnerable.
They have to be tough.
And you, too, Sally.
I didn't touch your clothes.
I swear to God,
I never touched them!
- I didn't touch them.
- Sally.
I didn't!
Didn't cut them, I promise.
I don't care about my clothes.
I can't really tell.
1804, I think.
It's hard to see.
The coin's pretty worn down.
She probably found it in Blackwood's studio.
I don't want her going down there anymore.
I'm worried about her, Kim.
It's not safe.
- Hey. This is Joanne.
- Mommy?
Oh, sweetie, it's you!
How are you?
Can I come home?
- You wanna come home...
- The sashimi. Stuart, the sashimi.
- I don't like it here.
- You what?
Honey, don't fret.
It's so beautiful there.
You just need to get used to it.
But it's cold.
- Huh, Honey, what?
- My bed is too big.
- Sweetheart.
- And I think I'm getting sick.
You're not getting sick.
Honey, it will take a little tiny bit of getting used to, but you are gonna be so happy there.
Okay? I promise.
You'll get used to it.
I gotta go, honey.
Mommy's gotta go.
I'll see you soon. Bye!
Kim?
- Don't leave.
- What's wrong?
Even when I'm asleep.
And don't turn off the lights.
I'll be right here.
Come on.
Kim?
I love you.
I love you.
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy, please!
Daddy!
Sally, what's the matter?
What's the matter?
I don't want them to come anymore.
Who, Sally?
The little things.
They live in the basement.
They gave me the silver dollar.
They said they wanted to be my friend.
But they're horrible and mean.
Oh, Sally.
- You just had a nightmare.
- No, don't say that!
It's okay.
My bear.
Look what they did to my bear.
Your dad tells me art is your favorite subject.
I wish I could draw.
Drawing is easy.
The other kids can't do feet and hands.
When you say "the other kids", do you feel they're different from you?
My doctor back home asked me that.
What was your answer?
Okay. Let's start with something easier.
What's your favorite color?
What is that?
Purple?
Black.
How about these little things you saw?
What do you think they are?
Fairies.
Or gnomes.
But scary ones?
And you say they know your name?
They talk to you?
Yes.
What do they say?
They want to play with me.
Is that all?
They say my parents don't love me.
Can I go now?
Just a few more questions, okay?
There is a lot of anxiety in that little girl... and a deep belief, that she's not wanted.
I believe that's what's triggering these fantastic episodes.
She told me she found a little tray... filled with teeth right inside that fireplace.
Yeah. She found a tooth, but that doesn't mean anything, does it?
She's constructing this elaborate fantasy... about wrinkles, claws, fangs.
Now she's individuated each one of those things, her imaginary world, its inhabitants.
It's as detailed as any
I've ever encountered.
What do we do?
I'd like to try her on a stronger medication, for a start.
I'll ask her doctor in L.A. to send me a copy of her charts.
You call my office, make another appointment.
Okay, great.
Meanwhile, I'll give you something to help her sleep.
I'm going to be late.
I can't believe it.
If we don't get the extension on this loan, we're not gonna get the paintings or the furniture... back on time.
We forgot the invitations for the historical society.
Maybe we should just postpone the dinner.
Kim, it's Architectural Digest.
We have to get the house on the cover.
- I know.
- If we don't,
I'm never gonna get my career back, and we're not gonna sell the place.
- How often we've talked about this?
- What about whats... been happening?
What, Harris?
That was an accident.
I'm talking about Sally.
These things...
- It's all in her head!
- Yeah, but it's real to her.
It doesn't matter if we see it.
Come on!
Calm down!
I'm gonna walk. It'll be faster.
I'll see you back at home.
I'm not sure how lucid he'll be.
He's pretty heavily sedated.
Mr. Harris,
I know this is difficult, but I need to understand something.
I need to know what Sally saw so that I can help her.
Is she out of the house?
No.
Out.
She needs to be out of there.
Why?
Why was that room sealed up?
Grandfather.
Your grandfather closed it up?
Yes.
Why?
After...
After...
After what?
Blackwood.
What about Blackwood?
Lot 1134.
Public library.
Get her out of our house.
The library will be closing in 15 minutes.
The library will be closing in 15 minutes. Thank you.
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for the librarian.
Lot 1134.
Emerson Blackwood,
Special Collections. One sec.
Right this way.
Can't remember the last time anyone requested these.
- They're beautiful.
- I'm a designer.
I've been working at Fallen Mill.
Wow.
Now, that's a privilege.
Personally, I think
Emerson Blackwood rivaled Audubon.
Come across his mural?
A mural?
Where?
There in the house, supposedly.
If you do,
I'd love to see it.
Hello?
Now, it's pretty ironic, really.
For a committed realist, someone who insisted on drawing only from nature, to do these at the end of his life.
I've looked at everything by Blackwood, and I've never seen any of these.
Oh, you wouldn't. The family made it a restricted donation.
These may never be published.
Is it possible to get copies?
I'll see what I can do.
"Wrinkles, claws, teeth?"
Have you ever read Machen?
Arthur Machen. Welsh.
He believed in fairy folk, these ancient entities from the netherworld, predating mankind.
Blackwood quotes him extensively.
Here, uh... that line.
There.
"One life must be taken".
These creatures had to take one human life... every time they emerged to replenish their ranks.
Many of these creatures fed on the bones, the teeth of young children.
And then there's a... a truce, a pact of sorts, between Pope Sylvester the 2nd and these ancient beings... in the year 9 hundred and 99.
In exchange for human teeth, they start leaving silver pieces under the pillow.
Now, this... is the last known drawing by Emerson Blackwood, made shortly before his disappearance and the loss of his child.
His child?
Blackwood's only son vanished, lost.
Not long after,
Blackwood himself disappeared... without a trace.
No!
No!
No! Please!
No!
Sally!
Sally, what's wrong?
Sally, open the door!
Oh, my God!
Oh, oh.
Shh.
Dear, thank goodness you're home.
Where is she?
I put her to bed.
She wouldn't stop screaming.
Sally?
Kim!
She's not down here.
I think she's run away.
She's done it before.
You know, once she tried to walk all the way back to L.A... from our family home in Boston.
I wouldn't be surprised if that's what she's doing.
I went and visited
Harris today.
Blackwood had a son.
Did you know that?
And when he was eight, he disappeared.
And Blackwood vanished a few days later.
Why are you telling me this?
A lot of what Blackwood wrote at the end of his life, it's awfully close to Sally's story, gnomes, creatures, all of it.
Kim, don't tell me you believe this.
Something terrible happened in that basement.
We need to leave.
- Put a million miles between...
- What're you talking about?
- us and that house.
- Every cent I have... is in that house. Okay?
And you're saying... that we just walk away?
Look, I... I accept that my daughter has problems, okay?
Thank you.
We all know that.
But they do not involve monsters in the basement.
There she is.
Come on, Sally.
Get in the car.
Sally, please, just tonight, after the party we'll talk, okay?
Four, three, two and one.
There.
After the party,
I will get you outta here.
No matter what.
I promise.
- Sally!
- No.
I took it from them.
- You can't have this.
- They stoled it.
You don't understand.
I need it to fight back.
- Absolutely not.
- Please!
Nobody believes me.
Sally, I trust you, and you can tell me anything, anything at all.
They don't like bright lights either.
These things.
They don't?
Then I have a good idea.
Mr. Jacoby, I am so glad you could make it.
- Alex, call me Charles.
- Charles.
- My wife, Evelyn.
- Hello, Alex.
It's a pleasure.
Come on in.
The house looks absolutely fantastic.
You done a remarkable job.
Well, thank you.
We'd love the nickel tour.
Of course.
That's the whole point.
The foyer, obviously.
The, uh, the mahogany, we shipped from the very same vendor... that Blackwood used in London.
It's been in business since 1865.
You know Bill from the... heritage board.
Easy, Sally. Not everybody wants to have their photograph taken, okay?
So, Alex, where's Kim?
Uh... I think she's still upstairs.
Why don't you step into the library, grab a drink, and I'll, uh...
I join you there in a moment.
Kim, hey, what's going on?
Her drawings. They're exactly
Blackwood's sketches.
Yeah, I'm sure she probably saw your photographs and copied them.
No, she didn't.
Kim, please,
Jacoby's here.
- Alex, this is your daughter!
- I know.
This is serious!
Just because you keep denying it does not mean...
- it's not happening.
- Kim, I can't do...
Excuse me, Mr. Hurst.
- When should we serve dinner?
- Ten minutes, please.
Kim, everybody is waiting.
Will you come downstairs?
- We can talk about this later.
- No.
- I have proof, Dad. Look!
- Not now, honey.
- Please!
- Not now. Come on!
Welcome, everybody.
Please, have a seat.
Uh... if I could just say a few words... to all of you friends of Fallen Mill, both big and small.
Um... thank you for joining us this evening.
It means a great deal to us.
Every aspect of this restoration, um... has followed the exact specifications... and materials used in the original construction of the house, um... including the wood assembling techniques, the layout in the kitchen, even the, uh... lacquering process for all the timber.
It's something Kim and I are very proud of, I'm sure all of you, with your vast array of expertise, will, uh... appreciate the attention to detail.
Um... the art you see on the walls, the friezes, even the furniture that you're sitting on, uh, has all been meticulously chosen, reassembled or restored, depending on its condition, uh, to, I think, truly represent the essence of the Blackwood collection.
Uh... so, thank you to the heritage board... for their assistance, and to the historical society too.
Um... and of course, to our guest of honor,
Charles Jacoby.
Your, uh... your interest in our projects, um... is nothing short of inspirational.
So, thank you.
And, uh... finally, to the house itself.
May its newly restored life be long and happy.
I guess not everybody is a fan of tonight's menu.
Poor Sally.
No one believes you.
Sally.
What do you want?
Please just tell me what you want!
We want you!
Daddy!
Daddy, please!
Daddy!
Sally?
- Daddy!
- Sally?
Daddy!
Daddy, they're in here!
Open the door!
Sally!
Charles.
What's going on in there?
No! Get off of me!
Stop it!
Sally!
Sally. Sally.
Look at me.
Sally, look at me. Look at me.
Picture,
I took a picture.
I think we better call it a night.
I think we should.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Alex, can I talk to you?
I feel like I have no idea what to do.
I love my daughter, Kim, and I love you.
I love you, too.
We should go, right?
- I'll get Sally ready.
- I'll get the car.
- Will you put this in the car?
- Yeah.
Kim?
Hi.
Where are we going?
We're gonna go to a hotel downtown.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Alex?
Alex?
Alex?
It's okay, it's okay.
A life will be taken.
One life must be taken.
A life will be taken.
One life must be taken.
Sally.
Sally!
Child's teeth!
Kim?
Kim?
Kim?
Daddy?
Kim?
Kim?
Kim!
Kim! Please.
Kim.
Wake up, please!
Wake up, Kim. Wake up, Kim.
Wake up Kim.
Wake up Kim.
Wake up, Kim.
The key. The key.
Kim, please!
Daddy! No!
Kim!
Kim, please!
Sally?
Ah.
Ah!
Sally? Sally!
Kim!
Let go of me!
Don't make me go in there!
Kim! Please!
Kim?
Kim?
- Please, Kim!
- I'm here, Sally!
No, please!
Sally!
Kim?
No! Go away!
Hold on!
Hold on! I got you.
Keep them away, Sally.
Use the light. Use the light.
Kim!
Get him.
No! Please!
Get away from me!
Get off of me!
When I cut this rope, Sally, you run!
Please!
You run!
You got that?
No, what about you?
No! Please!
Be strong.
Kim!
No!
Sally?
Sally?
Sally, are you okay?
Sally.
Alex?
Kim!
Kim!
Kim!
Dad?
Daddy?
Daddy.
Please!
That's far enough, Sally.
I love you, Kim.
They will find us.
They will find us and hurt us.
We must fight.
No, we will go deeper, and we will wait.
They will forget, and others will come.
When will they come?
When will we get them?
Soon, soon.
- We have all the time in the world.
- Yes.
All the time in the world.
All the time in the world.
NARRATOR: No planet beats
Saturn forjaw-dropping beauty.
CAROLYN PORCO: Saturn is the most photogenic pIanet in aII the soIar system.
Some of the pictures are to die for.
NARRATOR: But the postcards only tell part of the story.
KEVIN BAINES: You know, beauty is onIy skin deep.
It reaIIy is roiIing and seething inside.
NARRATOR: For ringside action, soar above the planet with its six-sided storms.
LINDA SPILKER: I couId just imagine, what it might be Iike to
Iike hoId a ring particIe in my hand?
NARRATOR: Even more mystery surrounds the impressive Fountains of Enceladus where the secrets of life might spring from the moons salty geysers.
CHRIS McKAY: This is the
IittIe moon that has it aII.
And the sampIes are coming out in space, there's a big sign there:
Free SampIes: Take One.
NARRATOR: Then drop by th big orange moon Titan and descend beneath its smoggy veil.
RALPH LORENZ: It wouId be one of the seven wonders of the soIar system.
NARRATOR: Take to Titanian skies for a magical mystery tour.
JULIAN NOTT: The baIIoon just aIIows extraordinary possibiIities for expIoring Titan.
NARRATOR: Drift over propane lakes, flammable sand dunes and methane streams.
JOHN SPENCER: You couId actuaIIy stand next to a babbIing brook of
Iiquid methane.
I sometimes wonder, what wouId that sound Iike?
NARRATOR: But nothing is as it seems here.
BOB BROWN: If you put your hand on a Iava fIow on
Titan, you wouIdn't burn your hand, you wouId freeze it.
NARRATOR: All this, and more, and only a billion miles from home.
Ready to take off?
There has never been a better time to venture where no human has gone before.
To follow in the footsteps of our robot pioneers and explore the planets of our solar system. lmagine boarding a flight to Saturn.
What would you need to know before travelling?
The best ringside vantage points?
The must-see moons?
Think of this as your personal guide to the splendor of the
Saturnian system.
A wandering spot of light twice as far as Jupiter and four times further than the asteroid belt.
Although its a billion miles from home,
Saturn has always commanded our attention.
CAROLYN PORCO:
Saturn is the most phenomenoIogicaIIy rich pIanetary system that we have in our soIar system because of its rings and pIanet and magnetosphere and an enormous coIIection of very diverse moons.
It has it aII and I mean even just taking the rings as an exampIe, in Saturn's rings we find exampIes of the other rings around Jupiter, around Uranus and Neptune, we find them in Saturn's rings so.
If you wanted to ask fundamentaI questions about the soIar system in generaI,
Saturn wouId be the pIace you wouId go.
Narrator: When the
Cassini-Huygens spacecraft took off in 1997 for a close encounter with
Saturn it was packed with essential items for long adventure in deep space: a power generator, extra fuel, a good antenna, and a moon probe. lmaging team leader,
Carolyn Porco made sure it took along a pretty good camera too.
After all, this destination is the pin-up boy of the solar system.
Saturn might be the second largest planet in the solar system, but like gas giant neighbor Jupiter, it's a triumph of show over substance.
KEVIN BAINES: Saturn, first of aII is a big giant gas baII, actuaIIy it's a big giant baII of fIuid, and the outer parts of it are gases, atmospheres.
But as you go deeper it gets hotter and hotter and aIso gets more pressurized, and so if you get down deep enough you start getting sort of fIuid effects.
NARRATOR: Saturn is a big boy, but pound for pound, a cosmic lightweight. lt's big enough to swallow 765 Earths, but as the least dense planet, it would float on water.
Like Jupiter, this is a world with nowhere to stand.
With no solid surface, it's hard to measure how long a day is, though the cloud tops go around about every 1 1 hours.
But it's what's up aboVe, not down below, that will draw the crowds to Saturn.
TORRENCE JOHNSON: It's just hard to imagine anything more beautifuI than the ring system.
They're the first thing any kid with a teIescope wants to Iook at.
NARRATOR: Spotting these rings from a backyard telescope is a treat. ln an instant they can all but disappear when Saturn tilts toward the sun.
TORRENCE JOHNSON: The over wheIming thing that you as a space tourist wouId be struck by is how incredibIy thin they are.
CAROLYN PORCO: They are onIy no thicker than about one or two stories in a modern day buiIding.
NARRATOR: lnterested in seeing for yourself?
Strap in Space TraVelers, its quite a ride.
After seven years and a billion miles of space, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft faces its greatest challenge on June 30th 2004: to go into orbit.
First it had to maneuver through an obstacle course of rings.
TODD BARBER: The hopes and dreams of thousands of scientists and engineers are resting on the next few moments.
Wed been to Saturn twice before with Voyager 1 and
Voyager 2 space craft but rather than these quick
Kodak moments we wanted to take a nice Iong IeisureIy
Iook at the
Saturnian system, the onIy way to do that was to sIow down,
Iet Saturn's gravity capture us into orbit.
MISSION CONTROL: Current speed of the Cassini
Huygens spacecraft is just under
70, 000 miIes per hour per hour and increasing as
Saturn's gravity puIIs us in.
NARRATOR: Cassini presses on, aiming for the gap between the outer F and G rings, hopefully clear of orbital debris.
BOB MITCHELL: We turned the main high-gain antenna in the direction the craft wouId see the ring particIes coming toward it, so that it wouId act as a shieId.
NARRATOR: You are listening to the actual recording of tiny particles hitting the spacecraft as it crosses the plane of the rings.
MAN: Let's go ahead and switch
Canberra over to V two.
NARRATOR: So far, so good.
But as Cassini disappears into radio silence behind
Saturn, eVerything rests on the spacecraft firing its engine perfectly and slowing down. lts a nail-biting wait at Mission Control.
MISSION CONTROL:
Go ahead SOI com.
The DoppIer has fIattened out!
Ok we have burn compIete here for the SOI orbit insertion burn.
NARRATOR: As Cassini emerges proudly from
Saturn's shadow, it turns to cross the ring plane again.
TODD BARBER MISSION
CONTROL: To any potentiaI inhabitants of the
Saturnian system, your eyes are not deceiving you tonight.
There is a 32nd moon gracing your night sky tonight and that is the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft.
NARRATOR: With Saturn's
62 known moons ,
Cassini finds itself in good company, with out of-this-world photo opportunities to make even a seasoned professional gasp.
CAROLYN PORCO: Saturn is the most photogenic pIanet in aII the soIar system so I just it, you know,
I mean you couIdn't get
Iuckier than me, right?
The ones that, give me shivers, you know, are Saturn with the rings where Saturn is a crescent or were Iooking down on the rings from above and there's a moon in the background.
They are just artistic compositions.
Here I am Ieading a team of scientists, our duty, ourjob is to take images and we have this fantastic target.
I kind of have this feeIing Iike I'm the, you know, standing on the bridge Iooking out the window, you know, I have a very strong feeIing of being at the forefront, being out there expIoring myseIf.
That's the thriII of it for me.
NARRATOR: The view from
Cassini's bridge exceeds anything seen before.
LINDA SPILKER:Low and behoId as we got cIose enough it Iooked Iike aII of the rings dissoIved into aII of these individuaI ringIets Iike grooves on a phonograph record for peopIe who remember phonograph records and it was just very exciting to try and figure out what was causing aII that structure.
What Iooked Iike rather featureIess rings in a teIescope now had thousands of features in them.
CAROLYN PORCO: I was surprised at how surprised
I was at the cIarity of the images because I thought to myseIf weII for Pete's sake, you know,
I've been thinking about this for years, for 14 years I've been thinking about this,
I've been pIanning these images for a decade or whatever it was, you'd think I wouId have, you know, anticipated weII were going to have this kind of resoIution, its going to Iook Iike this and I just hadn't.
NARRATOR: For the first time, vivid details of Saturn's rings is revealed , beckoning us to stare in wonder for a closer inspection.
NARRATOR: EVeryone is familiar with the rings of
Saturn.
But what would you highlight if it were you sending back the postcards?
Every tour itinerary ha one main attraction.
With Saturn, you just cant miss the rings.
As imaging team leader for Cassini,
Carolyn Porco has had a ringside seat.
CAROLYN PORCO: The rings consist ofjust countIess particIes and they range from the size of big bouIders perhaps the size of smaII apartment buiIdings aII the way down to the finest, finest dust particIe and everything in between and they're aII orbiting Iike crazy around Saturn at 20 to 40,000 miIes per hour but its Iike traffic on a highway you know everybody can be going ninety miIes an hour but reIative to each other they're going very, very sIowIy If you couId put a space craft there, you couId manage to move at the same speed then the speed wouIdn't be that dangerous at aII.
LINDA SPILKER: You can think of rush hour on a
Friday night you know on the freeway but the B ring has a Iot of traffic and a Iot of particIes, whereas you go to the A ring its a IittIe bit better, the C ring is more
Iike being out in the country, you aren't going to see ring particIes too often.
NARRATOR: Possibly the remnants of a failed moon, the ring particles have been flattened by gravitational forces into a super thin disc nearly
200,000 miles across.
Edge to edge, that's almost the distance from the Earth to the Moon.
CAROLYN PORCO: I have in fact imagined myseIf orbiting Saturn, hovering over the rings, its hard not to.
LINDA SPILKER: I couId just imagine what it might be Iike to Iike hoId a ring particIe in my hand and see what does it
Iook Iike?
Is it Iike a fIuffy snowbaII if I start to puII it apart?
What's it Iike on the inside, so I can think of each of the rings, A, B, C, D,
Iike different beaches and so you'd want to coIIect sampIes from each of those rings.
NARRATOR: And the icy grains on these Saturnian beaches are washed by passing traffic.
LINDA SPILKER: When a moon comes by it creates a wake, just Iike a motor boat creates a wake that goes behind it.
I kind of imagine the ring particIes doing an intricate cosmic dance around the pIanet and you can aImost picture a
IittIe baIIet dancers each with their own orbits and paths and sometimes coIIiding and encountering and sometimes not.
NARRATOR: Deeper secrets of this cosmic ballet are revealed, courtesy of a seasonal trick of the light.
Once eVery 1 5 Earth years, as Saturn makes its slow trip around the sun, summer swaps hemispheres. ln 2009, Cassini was in a perfect position to witness Equinox on Saturn.
CAROLYN PORCO: The Sun at exact equinox wiII be shining exactIy edge on to the rings.
But a IittIe bit before and a IittIe bit after the sun wiII be Iow to the rings just Iike the sun is now over London.
Any verticaI protuberances, either up or down beIow the rings wouId cast very
Iong shadows.
And we have in fact found that the rings aren't compIeteIy fIat.
There are pIaces where the ring particIes in fact form these structures that soar a miIe or two or three above the pIane of the rings.
For the first time in four hundred years we now know that the rings are three dimensionaI.
NARRATOR: Enormous and enormously complicated: the rings also form a major part of Saturn's amazing weather machine.
Upon arrival, you might be slightly disappointed that the cloudy face of Saturn looks a little plain.
But the planet beneath the rings is wild at heart.
Saturn's apparently peaceful appearance is due to a haze of high level ammonia in the upper atmosphere.
By looking deep into
Saturn in the infrared, using the planets own internal heat as a light source, Cassini has revealed the planets true nature
KEVIN BAINES: The winds on Saturn vary dramaticaIIy from the equator to the poIe, in fact at the equator, we have huge winds.
We are getting cIose to nine hundred miIes an hour now, near the speed of sound in that pIanet.
ANDY INGERSOLL: The winds are stronger at Saturn than they are on Jupiter and that's a surprise because the two pIanets are simiIar in terms of basic composition, they're both gas giants, and yet Saturn has Iess sunIight to power the winds and the winds are stronger.
Try explaining the six-sided vortex at the North Pole!
ANDY INGERSOLLL:
Saturn has a hexagon.
Its some kind of a wave but its a permanent wave.
Its been there since
Voyager discovered it back in 1 e80 and its just one more exampIe of how atmospheric features which are basicaIIy nothing more than just gas they Iast forever on these pIanets.
NARRATOR: There is another permanent storm at the
South Pole.
Not quite as strange , but gigantic in size: At five thousand miles across, you could almost fit the whole earth inside.
ANDY INGERSOLL: The South
PoIe has something that
Iooks very much Iike a hurricane eye except the cIouds five times the height of the eye waII around a terrestriaI hurricane.
KEVIN BAINES: So its kind of a window, into the depths of Saturn showing us just how dramatic the pIanet reaIIy is.
Its reaIIy kind of neat.
NARRATOR: And at the bottom of this window: storms within the storm.
Adding their own level of complexity to the weather forecasts of this alien planet, are the rings.
For half a Saturnian year the rings block the light in the northern hemisphere and the other half of the year its blocked in the southern hemispheres.
ANDY INGERSOLLL: We are interested in studying seasonaI changes on Saturn because of this extreme effect of the rings.
AIready we know that the sky was bIue when the northern hemisphere came out of the rings shadow and its now turned sort of pinkish, yeIIowish, hazy coIor because.
There's somehow smog deveIoped in the atmosphere once the sun started shining.
ProbabIy not too different from the smog in Earths atmosphere, organic compounds or something.
NARRATOR: For a planetary weatherman like Andy lngersoll, Saturn has it all.
ANDY INGERSOLLL: If I had an airpIane that couId fIy in Saturn's atmosphere,
I think it wouId be a wonderfuI sight to be surrounded by rings it wouIdn't get dark at night there's more Iight on the night side of Saturn from the rings than there is from the fuII moon on earth so you couId certainIy read a newspaper on the dark side, on the night side of Saturn.
NARRATOR: There'd be no shortage of strange stories to read by ring shine in the Saturn
Express.
And a lot of breaking
"galactic" news.
For Saturn is far from the only show in town.
NARRATOR: ln case you haven't heard yet, the biggest story in the
Saturn system is coming from the tiny moon, Enceladus. lts shaping up as perhaps the hottest place in space to search for life.
Shiny, white Enceladus.
A bright ball hiding within Saturn's diffuse E ring, this was a moon of little consequence until
Cassini started sniffing around.
But something was fishy here.
BONNIE BURATTI: It was first found by the magnetometer team.
They saw this hint of something in the magnetic fieId of Saturn wasn't just right it was being kind of defIected to the side.
LINDA SPILKER: It was
Iike unraveIing a puzzIe.
And so the magnetometer team said Iets go cIoser.
As we got cIoser we watched as a star went through we noticed the brightness, something is going on.
CAROLYN PORCO: We couId see even from a distance there seemed to be this materiaI coming off the
South PoIe and it was so dramatic and so unusuaI that we thought weII it might be a camera artefact.
NARRATOR:
Enceladus is tiny, iust 300 miles across.
Too small for any kind of dramatic geology.
BONNIE BURATTI: If you Iook at EnceIadus, it kind of Iooks Iike its covered in snow.
Its very bright, its as bright as freshIy faIIen snow.
CAROLYN PORCO: Everywhere you Iook there's fractures.
There are mountain ranges and there are deep chasms and when we finaIIy Iooked at the south poIe that's when it just became apparent, that's where aII the activities going on.
NARRATOR: The team found something extraordinary.
Row after row of enormous geysers shooting water and ice crystals out into space from the snowy white surface.
LINDA SPILKER: It was Iike a giant detective story, piece by piece putting the evidence together and untiI finaIIy we get back that reaIIy great picture, the smoking gun, showing the geysers actuaIIy coming out from the south poIe of EnceIadus.
TORRENCE JOHNSON: Water and water ice are spewing out of giant cracks, from a region about the size of southern CaIifornia which apparentIy just a big geothermaI fieId.
You can think of it that way.
NARRATOR: lt doesn't look much like California from orbit, just cool, as you'd expect an icy moon this far from the Sun to be.
But that's the mystery of Enceladus.
CAROLYN PORCO: I mean the bIoody thing is hot.
The south poIes hot.
OK, its Iike its as crazy as saying the North PoIe of the Earth is hotter than the equator.
NARRATOR: The best indications so far suggest the source of the water lies in a subterranean ocean or sea, hidden beneath the icy crust under the South Pole, warmed by tidal heating.
BOB BROWN: Its been a mystery because EnceIadus is so smaII.
Its not supposed to have that much heat.
We think that heat source under ground meIts water and that meIted water, which might be mixed with some ammonia and other things to Iower is meIting point, works its way out of the ground and spews up into space.
CHRIS McKAY: Here is the surprise entry in the search for Iife.
This IittIe moon that you'd expect wouId be pretty dead and duII, and coming out of the South PoIe of it is a jet of water-ice.
AII the things you need for Iife are there.
There's an energy source, there's a water source, there's an organic materiaI source, there's a nitrogen source, check, check, check, aII the requirements for Iife.
This is the IittIe moon that has it aII.
And, the sampIes are coming out in space, there's a big sign there:
Free SampIes: Take One.
We just fIy through and grab it on our way.
CAROLYN PORCO: I think it is the go to pIace in our soIar system right now for investigating issues of astrobioIogicaI importance.
It wins out the game over Mars, over Europa, over Titan even simpIy because of accessibiIity.
Its accessibIe.
If these jets are deriving from Iiquid water then they're there for the, the sampIing.
NARRATOR: The Cassini team has been flying the spacecraft at heights as low as 15 miles on its way to the plumes.
Unbelievable precision flying for a remotely controlled robot, that was never designed for such a feat, a billion miles from Earth.
CHRIS McKAY: From Cassini we Iearn that there's methane in the pIume, nitrogen in the pIume, ammonia in the pIume, organic moIecuIes in the pIume, its a reaI soup.
Were seeing a soup of organics being spewed out into space where its freezing.
You can aImost go there and jar it, put it in a can and seII it on Earth as organic nutrient soup
NARRATOR: On Earth, geysers and hot springs are home to bacteria with pedigrees dating back to the beginning of life.
They can also be breathtaking,
But nothing on Earth matches the Saturnian cold faithful.
TORRENCE JOHNSON: Sitting there at the South PoIe of
EnceIadus and taking a Iook at Saturn, whiIe you're sitting there watching this eruption going on wouId be beautifuI.
CAROLYN PORCO: It wouIdn't be a dangerous thing.
You wouId see these towering dramatic fountains ofjust icy particIes.
You wouId never see them stop because some of them actuaIIy extend tens of thousands of kiIometers into the space above the
South PoIe and in fact into orbit around Saturn, this is how the E ring of
Saturn is formed.
NARRATOR: Cassini has solved the mystery of how at least one of
Saturn's rings formed.
And this may help solve the bigger mystery of life beyond Earth.
NARRATOR: Enceladus may be the hottest ticket in town, but don't overlook the heavyweight contender for the title of moon with the most: Titan.
Larger than
Mercury or Pluto,
Saturn's Titan is the only other world apart from the
Earth and Venus to have both solid ground and a thick atmosphere.
RALPH LORENZ: Titan if it weren't in orbit around another pIanet, wed have no hesitation in caIIing it a pIanet in its own right.
BOB MITCHELL: We knew going that Titan was going to be exciting.
Titan was a mystery hidden inside this hazy foggy atmosphere.
NARRATOR: Cassini confirmed that Titan is shrouded in thick orange smog.
Laboratory experiments have shown this could be the result of four and a half billion years of sunlight reacting with the thick nitrogen and methane atmosphere.
Cassini's camera could only see partly through the haze: the patches of light and dark looked like continents and oceans.
CAROLYN PORCO: The picture we had of Titan before we got there was that it was going to be dark and eerie and coId.
As dark as twiIight is on the Earth even at high noon and you couId be standing on a body the size of the Mediterranean brimming with paint thinner.
NARRATOR: For over 7 years, the European Huygens probe rode piggyback on the
American Cassini spacecraft.
On Christmas Day 2004, it was sent on its way.
Planet Earth never attempted to land on such a distant world before.
With the Huygens probe on final approach to Titan, operations switched to
European mission control.
RALPH LORENZ: The probe hurtIed into Titans atmosphere at
6km a second.
The atmosphere wouId have been gIowing vioIet around the probe as it deceIerated.
NARRATOR: Once on a parachute, the probe descended for the first 80 miles , seeing nothing but smog and haze.
RALPH LORENZ: As we got cIoser to the surface down at about 30km the surface features started to peek through the haze.
ProgressiveIy this
Iandscape emerged of these bright hiIIs cut by these smaII dark channeIs, that showed there had been rain, at some time in the past.
NARRATOR: The signal was taking over an hour to reach Earth.
No doubt Huygens was sending postcards from the edge.
JONATHAN LUNINE: There were just 20 of us in the office area where the pictures were deIivered it was dark in Germany, it was the winter, it reaIIy feIt Iike we were out there gazing at this aIien worId that was just at our door step.
NARRATOR: The probe drifted further, snapping these remarkable images all the way down.
RALPH LORENZ: We aII kind of saw; a back yard in Arizona or the French Riviera, wherever it was you were from, you kind of saw some aspect of Titan that
Iooked famiIiar.
CAROLYN PORCO: They were everything that our images from orbit were not.
You couId see a dendritic drainage pattern that
Iooked Iike a river system just Iike a river system wouId appear on the Earth.
So that was, boy, that was heady, that was Iike oh, it was Iike JuIes
Verne come true.
It was just spectacuIar.
Rocks.
We've got rocks.
Yes, yes, yes.
Look Marty!
Look!
We've just earned aII of our pay checks.
NARRATOR: Huygens landed on Titan. lt sent back these few hundred pictures until the batteries died and the probe froze solid.
RALPH LORENZ: The probe
Ianded with a thud, on basicaIIy a stream bed, an area Iittered with rounded cobbIes, which showed that these IittIe rocks, ice particIes had been tumbIed around in a stream, at some point in the past.
JONATHON LUNINE: The whoIe thing was just very chiIIing.
Not in the sense of temperature but just in the sense of what we were Iooking at.
It was very, very aIien.
BOB BROWN: Its not a pIace where you want to just jump out there in your shoes and socks and shorts and t-shirts.
Its roughIy 200 degrees
Fahrenheit coIder than dry ice.
NARRATOR: With a surface temperature this low, nothing is what it seems on Titan.
CHRIS McKAY: Titan is a worId with Iiquids.
The difference is the
Iiquid is not water.
The Iiquid is methane.
Think of gasoIine, its a Iiquid-Iike white gas.
TORRENCE JOHNSON: So you've got rivers of
Methane fIowing on the surface.
Anybody who has Iooked out of an airpIane window, fIying over desert and things Iike this say yeah,
I sort of understand what's going on, on the surface there.
RALPH LORENZ: Because its so coId water behaves Iike rock does and methane behaves Iike water does, everything has just sort of shifted aIong a scaIe of voIatiIity.
NARRATOR: How do you end up with a landscape that looks so much like home on a world that's so different?
NARRATOR: Methane soaks into ice like water into the ground.
And just like on Earth, any overflow will cut its path downhill.
JOHN SPENCER: Titan wouId be a wonderfuI pIace to visit.
Stand next to a babbIing brook of Iiquid methane, running by your feet.
And I sometimes wonder, what wouId that sound Iike?
TORRENCE JOHNSON: In fact as we took radar pictures of other parts of Titan we found even wiIder things.
In the Northern poIar areas there are entire
Iakes or seas.
It Iooks Iike for aII the worId you couId go and take a boat and go do jet skiing or something, right you know up and down these channeIs there.
BOB BROWN: Titan is the onIy other pIace in the soIar system that we know Iiquids exist on the surface.
So here you have on Titan huge reservoirs of Iiquid naturaI gas and oh by the way we have thrown in some ethane, which is a sIightIy more compIex hydrocarbon and oh by the way there's some propane in there.
Everybody knows what propane is; you use it in your backyard BBQ.
NARRATlON: Cassini's radar spied lakes as big as inland seas, even bigger than Lake Superior.
BOB BROWN: Imagine standing on the shoreIine of what to you Iooks
Iike an ocean of Iiquid hydrocarbons.
That's got to be pretty speciaI.
NARRATOR: And if you think the lakes are weird, try the volcanoes.
BOB BROWN: We think the materiaI that comes out of
Titanian voIcanoes is a mixture of ammonia and water which aIIows water to meIt at a much Iower temperature.
NARRATOR: This is lava on Titan: a stinky mix of water and ammonia, molten at minus one hundred and fifty degrees.
BOB BROWN: You can buiId anything from smaII cones to Iarge mountains on
Titan out of this stuff.
If you were a visitor and you waIked and put your hand on a Iava fIow, you wouIdn't burn your hand, you wouId freeze it.
NARRATOR: ln stark contrast to the cryo-volcanoes and wet polar lake lands, bordering the equator are
Vast Titanian deserts, covered in dunes.
RALPH LORENZ: I think it wouId be one of the seven wonders of the soIar system What you'd see is aImost unending sea of massive dunes.
ExactIy the same size and scaIe as dunes we see on Earth.
Some areas where you see nothing but dunes for hundreds and hundreds of kiIometers.
The by-product of billions of years of production from the chemical smog factory in the upper atmosphere, the grains in
Titans dunes may literally fall from the sky.
Like a rain of flash frozen coffee grounds, they are swept by the wind into deep piles that cover
20% of the surface.
And like a good coffee, these Titanian dunes are dark and rich.
RALPH LORENZ: The dunes represent a massive inventory of organic materiaI, hundreds of times Iarger than aII the coaI for exampIe, on the Earth.
NARRATOR: You're not likely to be hauling this alien coal home, but the liquid hydrocarbons lapping on Titanian shorelines could be very useful for the return trip.
JONATHAN LUNINE:
There's more,
Iets caII it fossiI fueI type energy than we actuaIIy have known reserves on the Earth, by factor perhaps of ten or even hundred.
NARRATOR: Thats a lot of gas in anyone's language.
But something even more valuable might be found among the storehouse of organic molecules.
The answer to life, the universe and everything.
BOB BROWN: How do you go from such simpIe materiaI
Iike carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen, to something, which asks questions about where it came from?
That's a huge Ieap.
And on Titan there's a reaI good possibiIity that some of those difficuIt intermediate stages actuaIIy occur, it hasn't gone to compIetion at
Ieast we don't think it has, though there's some peopIe who think if we go to one of Titans Iakes we wiII discover Titanian bacteria that have figured out how to metaboIize
Iiquid methane.
CHRIS McKAY: That's not a Iiquid that we,
Iife-forms on Earth Iike, but maybe a Iife form on
Titan that grew up with
Iiquid methane wouId be perfectIy comfortabIe there and wouId Iook at shock that the thought that organisms wouId Iive in water, oh, my god, those things on Earth
Iiving in water.
Pity those poor
EarthIings.
We Iive in Iiquid methane.
Much more pIeasant.
NARRATOR: Titan is the ultimate test for life in our solar system. lf life exists under these alien conditions then you might find it anywhere.
NARRATOR: The Huygens mission will not be our only trip to Titan.
Nor Cassini our last visit to Saturn.
These are just bold first steps on a journey that's iust begun.
Even before the mission is oVer,
Cassini has left a thirst for a return trip.
Planetary explorer
Jonathan Lunine and aeronautical pioneer
Julian Nott think they know the perfect way to do it: a robotic hot air balloon.
JONATHAN LUNINE: So what were fIying over now is very much Iike the
Huygens Ianding site.
And I wouId Iove to see those ravines on Titan, those steep vaIIeys where the methane is fIowing and carving out the hiIIs, very much Iike what were seeing now.
NARRATOR: The dream is to return to Titan and drop a robotic balloon into the atmosphere.
A radioisotope generator will provide the electrical power and the waste heat to give the balloon lift in the chilly atmosphere.
JONATHAN LUNINE: Titan has a dense atmosphere, its coId, the gravity is Iow, the winds are gentIe so baIIooning is very easy.
JULIAN NOTT: I think this fIight just makes the point so beautifuIIy why a baIIoon is a wonderfuI way to expIore Titan.
If you're over an interesting area, its very easy to come down, maybe even Iand on the surface,
Iower instruments down.
JONATHAN LUNINE: One couId cover with a robotic hot air baIIoon the entire circumference of Titan in a space of perhaps six months.
NARRATOR: You shouldn't think of Titan as a place iust for robots.
With a thick protective atmosphere and plenty of frozen water, Titan could be a more user-friendly destination for
Earthlings than Mars.
JONATHAN LUNINE: When humans do finaIIy move out in to the soIar system and I think they wiII.
Titan wiII be seen as a somewhat distant but very attractive pIace to go pIay.
You don't need a pressure suit on Titan.
You don't have that feeIing as the astronauts describe it of trying to work with a beach baII between you arms.
NARRATOR: Breathing from a souped up scuba unit and out fitted in a cross between a super-ski suit and a hazmat coVerall, future Titanauts could explore with confidence.
JONATHAN LUNINE: You just need that thermaI protection and oxygen and then you can go pIay on the surface and take a baIIoon ride.
It wiII be a pIace where peopIe wiII want to go to see a truIy exotic and aIien worId.
NARRATOR: Not Even a minor rip in the suit will be life threatening.
RALPH LORENZ: I did a caIcuIation once of whether the smaII amounts of carbon monoxide wouId kiII you before the hydrogen cyanide did.
ActuaIIy it turns out that both are onIy enough to give you a headache.
The pIace wouId probabIy smeII Iike oiI finery.
NARRATOR: Speaking of refineries, re-fuelling for the return trip could be as simple as pulling up to the nearest lake to fill up your methane rocket, now under test development on Earth and if you reach as far as Titan, why not a side trip to Enceladus as well?
CHRIS McKAY: So on EnceIadus we are many steps ahead of where we are in terms of Mars or Europa.
We aIready know that there's organics.
We aIready know where they are.
We aIready know how to get them.
Its time to bring them back to Earth and Iook at them and ask the next
IeveI of questions, are they bioIogicaI?
CAROLYN PORCO: It may not happen for a very Iong time but I reaIIy think that's a must do for us in taking the next step and to me the question of whether or not Iife has gotten started eIsewhere in the soIar system is the reason why we do this, you know, because we want finaIIy, uItimateIy we want to come to understand why the
Earth has been the successfuI abode of Iife that it has become.
NARRATOR: MoVing now into the extended extended mission, the Cassini team met recently in London to take stock of where they'd been, and to plan the road ahead. lt was the 58th time they'd met and fitting that they chose the Royal
Observatory in Greenwich to celebrate.
The prime meridian here is the longitude, the mark on the ground, from which all great voyages are measured.
This is the view back to our remarkable home planet that the first human out here can look forward to.
A distant blue dot lost in the beauty of Saturn's backlit rings. lts a real image.
Another perfect postcard from Cassini urging us into the heavens.
JONATHAN LUNINE: Humans have Iooked out from the shores of seas and oceans and imagined great adventures.
Now think about standing on the shore of an aIien sea and we know those shores are there, we just have to go experience it.
I wouId Iike to go Iand in a baIIoon, step out, pick up one of those rounded pebbIes and toss it at Huygens.
KEVIN BAINES: Maybe we have to taIk about a pIanetary park down the road and where shouId we preserve for future generations.
You know, do we want to go in and mine Titan for its methane?
Maybe weII go mess up other pIaces perhaps but
Saturn is just an exquisite pIace and we shouId probabIy just
Ieave that aIone you know.
NARRATOR: With so many interesting moons in its flight path, NASA is making plans for what to do when Cassini's mission comes to an end around 2017.
LINDA SPILKER: We want to make sure that the space craft doesn't hit one of these bodies and so what were going to do, is put it into the atmosphere of Saturn.
TODD BARBER: Crash it into
Saturn and burn it in a bIaze of gIory after a rich twenty years of expIoration in space.
BOB MITCHELL: AII the moIecuIes that currentIy make up the Cassini spacecraft wouId stiII be at Saturn and in fact wouId be there forever.
NARRATOR: A fitting fiery funeral for one of the greatest interplanetary voyagers of all time. lt might be a ball of gas and float in water, but Saturn is a Very solid destination both for science and for viewing spectacular sights .
We've only begun to realize the riches it offers, and only because we sent a spacecraft to stay. lts the same story everywhere in the Solar System.
You'll never, know what your missing if you never venture to go.
AtZLIT  2010
So, where is this renowned father? will father show his face to you, sir?
A shallow womanizer fashions himself a dashing wit.
Perhaps he cannot hear your whimpering, sir.
Pathetic palter.
Very quick.
Move.
Some other dog beat us to the treasure.
Hear that?
No, please.
Mercy.
I will serve you.
Abelar, does it still exist?
Abelar?
Ah, yes.
Ruled by a queen, Eldoria.
She has passed on.
Her eldest... eldest child Ma'at is queen now.
Really?
I won't harm the queen, but I will make you do with her seed.
Not that it matters now.
I... I was wondering...
- how... how your enemies...
- To dust.
That will sting.
And now?
And now, say, "I won't feel anything except a little sting."
Tanis.
Tanis.
Are you listening to me?
- Sister.
- It is upon us, your dream.
It's happening.
After all of these years, the Sorceress has somehow returned from the dead.
Levana.
Please don't go.
Go, Lenor.
Please, find safety.
All of you leave at once.
I will alert the General,
Your Highness.
And we must find he who saved us before.
The Mercenary?
Your father.
But, our father is dead.
He died saving Abelar from the Sorceress.
Your father is not mine.
I was sired by the king but... you...
...you were by this mercenary.
Mother said you were the king's child to protect you.
You must leave the past behind.
Our kingdom needs us now.
Kingdom Bush is not my father?
No, but he who is lives.
If we so be separated mother said this will lead you to him. with this token, he will know you and you shall know him.
And this will help you to understand the sorcery.
My Queen.
They are within the palace,
Your Majesty.
You must come now.
You have to go.
No, come with us.
My Queen, you both have a long time to struggle.
I've trained you well,
Your Highness.
You are ready for what comes.
Stand. we can make sure of your safety if you follow this hall.
It will lead you out of the palace.
But what about you?
My duty is to remain here, Kara.
No.
If you stay, then so will I.
You can do nothing more here,
Dernier.
The Royals will scheme to save their skins. we will be left to fend for ourselves and not always with the truth.
They have no regard for us.
But I am sworn to...
You have sworn to love me, Dernier or was that just to weaken my will.
I love you.
Then save us my love.
- I must kill the infected.
- Leave her. She's a friend.
It's your wish.
There, it leads to a quay where our boat waits.
- It will take you to Durris.
- Durris?
An outlaw city?
If he still lives the people there will know his whereabouts.
Tanis,
I'm find remember what I said.
If we so be separated, you must find him. we've run out of time.
Run, Tanis.
- But sister.
- Hush.
You're not a child but a Princess of Abelar, a leader with responsibilities.
Act it.
Find your father.
Save our people.
They count on us, Tanis.
- I can't do this alone.
- You must.
Go. Now.
I command you.
Do not look back...
...or rest.
It's been what, 20 years? where's your mother's lover? what was his name again?
It seems to have slipped my mind.
He has not slipped mine. why, of course.
He sent your father to the Abyss.
I must have thought of a million different ways to make you and your mother suffer, but nothing was ever terrible enough.
I mean, how do you repay someone who buried you alive for 20 years?
Nothing smelled like life,
Your Highness.
You must be wondering how is it she is back looking so wonderfully restored.
Clearly, we watched your destruction.
Clearly, you shouldn't have given the final rights to a high priest with designs on your throat.
A pity he perished with some mysterious plague upon his return. who knows what lives in dust?
And who are you?
Go, go.
- where is my seat, Your Highness?
- I'm not sure.
Kill her.
Get the girl.
The palace is lost.
- The Queen is dead?
- Or worse. what are they?
Vampires.
But we will not die tonight.
I could fight harder.
You leave the killing to me. what is to become of us now or the kingdom?
My master is the son of a priest.
But, there is always a need for a pretty servant, and there is one against me as well.
- what is it?
- Hush, hush. why the guards they are so daunting?
They're trying to kill us. what?
Your blood.
It is read.
- It's my fault.
- No.
On your life run.
I have always loved you.
And who dies first.
I will.
And now, a ladder across the Abyss that I might free my father.
In my stead, you will awaken my seed.
She is the true daughter of my race, and though half human, she will be human no more.
Ah, Denier.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.
You used me. what?
No, I loved you.
Really?
Yes, right,
I was using you, Dernier.
You are evil.
Becoming a vampire isn't even the worst of me.
That and more.
Are you going to kill me now?
Bite my throat, drain me of my blood?
I want you.
I could soothe you, Dernier.
You could use someone like me for a slave.
I have too much over the past.
I will bring victims to you to fulfill whatever dark fantasies you have.
I will do whatever
I have to do for you?
You are a monster.
I will bow to you, Kara.
Kara, bow to her.
Life takes many forms in many worlds and she's in her final metamorphosis, her chrysalis. why me?
You are special.
But you've always known that.
Special in a way that no one else could see until it was too late.
And even as a child, you have always been cunning, intelligent, depraved.
You have tried to blend in or be a human, safe, but even as a child you knew you were different, filled with dark corruptness.
Are you ready to be free?
You're free now but not yet fully transformed.
I have pity for those who can walk in the curse of light and among these creatures. we have much more work to do before we can be safe.
I sent the princess to the reefs.
If she's dust, find her.
Know what she's plotting, and most importantly with whom. why me?
Because she will know and trust you when she's most vulnerable.
And if I refuse?
You've hungered for this day when you could be who you are and what you are to let those dark urges free.
Mother said this will lead you to him. with this token he will know you and you shall know him, and this will help you to understand the sorcery.
You're not a child but a Princess of Abelar, a leader with responsibilities.
Act it.
Find your father.
Save our people.
My princess.
You shouldn't have been wearing this?
Please.
- You cheated Dog.
- what?
Go weep to the gods.
You will die.
I shall cleave your thick ugly faces.
No dog cheats me and lives.
Thankfully, I'm not a dog but I do like to cheat.
Now, I'm gonna have to kill you like a bitch pup.
Holy shit.
I want this man.
She wants me.
I'll tell you what, wench, let me kill this dog and then I will bed you so hard...
Somebody you want me. wench, you've diminished my reputation.
It could be diminished, sir? why bog me, did I do your mother, huh, or, uh, sister perhaps?
The last of it, the late great Abelar and how it came to be overcome.
- Sir.
- I mean no disrespect, lady.
I noticed your cloak.
It came from the palace guard.
So, it is.
Like yourself, I barely escaped these foul creatures.
I'm here to spread the word of what these eyes have seen.
- You've seen much.
- Aye.
In this one world.
That's why you're here.
You've seen far too much sir.
Brother and sister?
Different mothers but a common father.
And you say we were meant to find our father?
Exactly. And together we're to destroy the Sorceress Xia and return Abelar to the people.
Uh-huh.
So, Princess, you speak for the Royal House?
That is correct.
How much am I to be paid to save your precious Abelar?
Paid?
I didn't mention anything about a bounty. we do this because it's right
- and just and it's what we should...
- This sword will not be drawn until it received proper compensation.
You disappoint again.
Oh, my lady, one night in bed with me and...
I'm your sister.
Half.
How could I expect any nobility from a pig like you. wait.
Look, your tail holds a certain fancy, but I am in need of coin and I'm willing to take your word that there will be a bounty. what do you know about him? well, not much.
Nothing at all.
Nor a trickster?
Aye, but this trickster knows where our sister may be, and to her our dear father.
A sister? where?
About that bounty?
If your word proves true, then you shall have it.
I gave you my word.
That should be sufficient.
I am called Aedan.
And what are you doing here? what?
Can't a brother help his sister?
After five years?
No.
This comes with some terrible price.
You're not a woman with many an option.
There's a foul tempered undertaker and eventual traitor wanting to see you skinned at dawn.
And what is this act of brotherly love going to cost me?
It's more privilege than the price. we get to save Abelar.
I don't think I'm dressed appropriately.
Plus, of course, there is a bounty.
And where would you get real bounty?
From Abelar.
She's your sister.
But maybe a...
...little more. well, what is your name.
You would like to sit down and have a drink with me, huh?
Tell us the tale, sister.
A fortnight ago the Sorceress Xia captured Abelar.
My sister, the Queen, was murdered.
Xia?
Didn't father put that Devil wench down or is that another tall tale? well, clearly he didn't put her permanently down, thus creating an opportunity.
She's back and she's taking Abelar with sorcery. which is to say she's infested Abelar.
Don't you have any conversation for me?
You are so beautiful.
It's all Greek to me.
She will continue to feed, to spread her darkness until the next full moon rises.
- And then?
- Oh, this part is good.
Xia will open the doorway to the Nether worlds.
You were saying?
Thus ending our very existence.
It's all so dire.
You see, sister, there's no bounty too great for saving this world.
Say we fancy the idea for a moment.
And that there is this massive bounty in gold, of course.
Aye, what makes you think us three here can stop this Vampire Queen?
I told her we're lovers not fighters. when need to have a plan, something less daunting, more rewarding.
- I am at a loss.
- we should take the traditional action, and hire mercenaries, like our dear father.
Yes, yes, but we're under time constraints.
In only a fortnight the moon will be full.
- I have a thought.
- It was only a matter of time.
Malia, you will find father and see if he has any ideas on the matter, and I with what funds to princess has on her presently will arrange for a dozen armed men.
Not just any men, no, no, no, but the type with honor and courage enough to win back Abelar.
By the gods I've heard that there are experienced barbarians in nearby Primeria, precisely the type of warriors that we needs. So, the Princess... she can wait here at Durris for our return, you know, holding down the fortress
- sort of thing.
- Or let us split the funds you possess, give us both a chance to hire the best warriors we can find on our way.
Aye, that could work as well. well, sister?
You take me as a fool at your own peril.
You are both much less than I'd hoped.
At the prison I spoke to the magistrate and he gave me your recent histories,
- theft, assault, cheating, embezzling...
- Right.
- Pick pocket and street whore?
- I have never picked a pocket.
You're both are the lowest of character, but my sister was firm and we must find our father and you are my only hope. we'll need horses.
I can acquire them.
- Are there other brothers and sisters?
- Ah, yeah, yeah, she's a day's ride away in a village called Chiba
Agreed then to Chiba Village.
Our father still lives?
I suppose. Last summer he was carousing in the secret of Nobu.
That was years ago.
The dog is likely dead as a cock, though, rotting in some dungeon.
50,000 gold pieces.
50 and that's my final word.
And I suggest we seal this fast. what's going on, sir?
Having an adventure, sister?
- A bitch dog.
- Come to lose again?
It isn't long now.
An entire new world.
I use Xia's body as a conduct.
It's a doorway. what have you learned?
The princess seeks one like her father.
The warrior who helped with Mitadonia.
He can see us fall into the Abyss.
Reduce her to dust.
Should I kill them now, the Princess and these two fools?
Learn the whereabouts of this father.
As you wish.
I tried to find father once right here.
- what was it like?
- Ah, it was like this... except for people trying to kill me.
- It's early yet.
- Maybe they'll remember you.
Oh, Malia, they would if they were still alive.
I meant what was it like to see him?
I didn't see father.
I found Rajan, our half sister.
Stay put. what does Rajan do here as a trade?
You mean when she's not drunk or passed out?
Hello sister.
I have a wonderful opportunity for you.
No thank you.
It did not work out last time.
It's only because you lack a sense of humor. what do you think they seek?
This drink.
Sister told me great stories about father... although I thought she spoke of a hired mercenary sent to save Abelar.
That was before I knew he was my father.
The man who I thought was my father, the King, well he was killed by Xia.
You really want to know who father is, God's truth?
Yes.
Our father is the lowest form of cowardly dog, a man who takes advantage of wives or widows, sells out his cohorts for coin and runs from a real fight.
That's who father is. what's the matter?
You don't like the truth?
You married, have sons?
Luckily no.
They're not so bad to look at.
Your whores?
Rajan, say hello to your sisters.
- More family?
- And with your help, we four... will save Abelar before the full moon.
The full moon is six nights away.
Time is short.
Ho, an adventure.
Alana.
Alana?
I'd forgotten her.
She's all grown and ready to leave this stink hole.
Alana, your favorite uncle has returned.
Don't you remember me?
I remember.
As formidable as she is, the girl is but a girl.
I meant no offense, niece.
I taught her a few things in my days as emperor's assassin.
Yes, I can see.
Sir, this is the most serious and most dangerous mission.
It's the Sorceress Xia we must destroy.
The Vampire Queen.
- Yes, and it is not suitable for a child.
- You think I'd be afraid.
Look, it's time my Alana saw the world, had a few wild, bloody adventures.
And vampires and sorcery are all a part of that.
The truth is, she will love many and leave many more choking on their entrails.
A sister, heh?
And a princess no less.
Do you plan to rob her?
Give me a little credit.
This comes at a good time.
I was worried.
How so? with my adventuring and killing days were behind,
I wouldn't be able to give her proper parenting.
Oh, betting brutes, horrible wars, ghastly death, and it's all still ahead of you.
I am sure it's all with my daughter.
The gods must choose to smile upon me.
You would really cut my throat back there?
Of course, uncle.
Yours particularly.
Sweet girl. what of grandfather?
Might he want to go as well?
Grandfather?
Our father?
Aye. He might crave one last good battle before setting down the sword?
- He's still killing?
- Oh, that rascal, his sword is always poised. want to meet the old dog?
Oh, let's be off.
There are kingdoms to save and men to bed.
I prefer wenches.
Then he lives? why not use your sorcery to destroy them all?
Sorcery hasn't been needed until the full moon, but it's now needed instead of your cold steel, Kara.
Her father was a great sorcerer callously taken by gods let alone by human yet this one day.
But how is that possible against their power?
Because there exists a breed of creatures who fears nothing.
So they can accomplish anything.
You describe a distinct human trait. we cannot chance these five meeting up with one called father.
They would alert him.
Aye.
So what do you suggest?
I think an early strike as they arrive in Nobu Village should do it.
I would need two of those like myself, day walkers.
And the father should be found.
See who wants their blood.
After I manage this task. what do you wish, to be made queen?
No,
I want my soul back.
After all the power you have felt in your veins?
I want to be who I am, what I am, not one of you.
Should I fear you, Kara?
You know what lies within me and I am what you need me to be.
Should I fear you?
You already do. we will wait 'till there is some separation.
Then take them one by one.
I don't expect much resistance except by the princess.
All in all, they are a pathetic group.
He comes here every evening to sell his catch.
Catch?
He's a fisherman now.
Now, now, ladies, you'll have to accept my apology.
I must leave.
There's an adventure in the offing.
Now, mark my words, if I didn't have to go off and save Emperor Micah's kingdom,
I would surely have you all to bed... again.
Can I see that spear right there, please?
Never mind.
There, why the long face, huh?
It is for the grand adventure that we live.
And it's not just the adventure itself.
It's the willingness to risk everything for it.
Something chased you off the street. what is your trouble, girl?
Something very terrible.
And what was that?
A vampire.
I know it's dead, but still I saw the things.
You see, I beleve you, girl.
This day there are vampires in Nobu.
So, I'm off. my, could you send an old rogue off with a proper farew
I believe we have an adventurer here.
I can taste it.
May the gods smile on your adventure, child.
The next time a warning would be nice. where can I find her?
Come now.
Levana,
- Kara?
- Your Highness.
You know what do with them.
This is your life now?
I have no life just the sins.
Bleak and bleaker.
That princess and they that hold it are under the sword.
Mind your own business, sir.
Nobu has always been a refuge where marriages are by and large human.
Now changes come to Nobu.
The world evolves.
Aye, mostly for the bad.
Do we have a quarrel, sir?
Have we met?
In the days before
I sought the peace of the sea,
I knew your kind. well, maybe I am sick but I was pleasured by the killing.
They deserved to die.
I loved hearing their suffering, seeing their terror, and the begging and screaming.
There was real pleasure in that.
Sometimes life does not unfold as it should, and I do not have to explain myself to you.
I ask again, do we have a quarrel, sir?
I am presently engaged.
Did I do your mother, huh?
So, where is this renowned father? will our father show his face to you, sir?
A shallow womanizer who fashions himself a dashing wit.
Perhaps we cannot hear your whimpering, sir.
Pathetic palter.
I know you'll have my head for that, but not if I have yours first. what is this?
I would appreciate that back.
Come and take it.
I ask you once if we had a quarrel.
I knew the princess.
Now we have a quarrel.
Joy that's not marred by love. we have much to celebrate now that the full moon is seen.
You, me, the great love affair we shared.
The love by which you destroyed my father, and had me with your stick to dust.
But I harbor no grudge. well, perhaps just a bit of heartbreak and spite.
And bring that ridiculous rebate of a weapon of yours. what does that make him?
Is he an active vampire or is he a quarter vampire? I mean, what... what is it?
Do you kill everyone you see?
You know, next time a warning would be nice.
Ada?
Come on!
Come over here!
- Get off me!
- Why?
- 'Cause I said!
- Ain't anybody else gonna see.
Not here!
But I'm already hard.
Come on!
No! I said no!
Fine.
Why is your skin so hot, anyway?
- Better go finish up the still.
- Wait.
I ain't got time for games.
Back there, then.
You sure?
Yeah. Come on.
I swear your skin feels different.
Really?
Well, it ain't.
Just drop it already.
Ada?
You come here.
Now, Bodey got something to tell you.
We're gonna be joined.
Well... When?
Next full moon, it'll happen.
If she's been true.
Got the papers?
May I go to the pit?
I'd like to pray on this.
Best go with her.
I... I'll go later.
Tell everyone to come on for dinner after you've finished.
Dawai?
What?!
Ow! Shit fire!
What you doing?
Nothing.
The candles need lighting.
You're supposed to come on for dinner.
Oh, is something... something good happening?
Bodey asked pa for us to be joined.
Well, that's...
...that is good news.
Bodey?
He'll do right by you
Want to listen to some music?
I'll play you your favorite.
Can't. Got to tell everyone before it gets late.
Tomorrow?
Yeah, tomorrow, then.
So, you'll come... for dinner?
I don't know.
I... I got...
I got things need tending to.
So...
I hope you do.
You get to everyone?
Yep.
Anyone say they ain't coming?
Dawai's the only one that seemed to be on the fence.
Figures.
You ain't spending no more time down there, anyway.
I'll do what i want.
You will do what Bodey tells you to!
Now that's the way it is.
You best get used to it!
Whatever.
You got something you want to say?
Oh, I'm just all up in knots is it.
Oh!
You're dripping, then?
Come a little late, though, ain't it?
Let me see.
Why? It's gross.
Come on, Ada!
You got that 'shine ready?
What's going on?
We got people coming over.
Bodey asked to be joined to your sister.
About time.
I want to, uh...
I want to thank you all for coming.
Today...
I give away my only daughter to be joined to Bodey Jenkin...
To continue in the ways that we hold sacred.
And I thank the pit with all my heart for making it so.
I raise this jug of 'shine
For all to taste who believe.
I'd like to say something.
Bodey, you're getting a good one.
I can tell you that.
Wish you all the best.
Eat up, all.
No!
Do you need any help?
Just this little redheaded one.
He's biter! No biting!
No biting!
Don't bite!
There we go.
- They're meaner than they look.
- Yeah, I'll bet.
Shit!
Shit?
Well, Jessaby.
- You must be real happy.
- Shut the fuck up, you retard.
Jessaby!
I want to talk to my sis alone.
All right.
Don't!
Don't what?
You keep your mouth shut.
I know.
They're gonna test you,
And you better blame it on somebody else. I don't care who.
I ain't letting Bodey take after pa 'cause of this, you hear?
We'll talk about it later.
No, we won't.
You're on your own.
You and Sustin's all happy now, but
If she'd been fooling around, you're gonna have to pay up.
Well, don't you worry your pretty, little head about it.
She was dripping today.
Just means she ain't been caught.
She'll pass.
Now leave it alone.
Was your brother sad?
About what?
He'll be asking someone to join him soon, won't he?
Want me to mention you to him?
Could you?
Take your grandpa a plate.
It's cold.
Yeah, well, it'll have to do.
It's nasty, though.
He won't complain.
What was your brother all tore up about earlier?
He's just being his ass self, as usual.
He don't care for Bodey?
He... he just don't want him horning in on things is all.
Like what?
I don't know.
He wasn't making much sense.
Grandpa?
I got you some food.
Grandpa?
You've been sleeping?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Are you hungry?
I thought so.
Let's get you some air.
Either you're getting fat, or I'm getting weaker.
We had everyone over to dinner tonight.
Bodey and I are gonna be joined.
I should have seen it coming already.
Not like there's anybody else could have asked.
I know who the next jug face is.
It's me.
It's mine.
I don't even know why i told you.
Not like you can help.
Here we go.
What's wrong with you?
Has anyone ever said no?
About what?
Being joined?
Is that why you're so quiet?
It's a woman's job to have babies.
You got to be joined to do that.
Is that all I'm good for?
It's an amazing thing, bearing babies... something no man will ever get to do.
Once Bodey gives you a little one,
You'll be beside yourself.
You'll see.
What if I can't?
Pit will make it right.
It always does.
Has the pit ever taken a baby?
Yeah, sure has.
Gonna check on that possum.
Yeah, that's what.
All right.
Now don't speak to nobody.
Just get what you need, and that's it, right?
Morning, Sustin.
What you got?
I got half peach, half apple.
They're both hot sellers right now,
I'm telling you.
Can't help you with that possum, though.
That ain't for sale.
All right. Thank you so much for coming in. You have a good day.
You finding everything all right?
Yeah.
Let me know if you need any help.
Do any good?
Pack of three.
Make them last.
Don't forget the laundry.
I know!
Must be nice...
To know who you'll be with, finally.
Oh, right.
All that he talks about is you now.
Is that so?
How many kids you think you'll have?
Mama says we need five or six to keep things going real good.
We'll have as many as the pit wants,
I reckon.
It's right.
Ada?
Eilen.
Run.
Eilen!
Oh, god!
Eilen?! Where's Eilen?!
Where is she?! Eilen?
Eilen?
Oh, no!
Dawai said nothing?
Not to me.
Hey...
You're down there all the time.
You seen him making one?
No.
Just his normal stuff.
I ain't make no jug face.
I swear.
The pit ain't spoken to you at all?
No.
Have all the families meet at the house at dark.
I'm sure you all know that
Eilen Jenkin was... was taken today.
Where's the jug face?
Dawai, do you swear
That the pit did not guide you hand to make a new jug face?
Well, when it does,
I don't know that it did or not.
I just wake up feeling funny.
And I did feel funny yesterday.
But I didn't fire nothing.
All right, now... now Dawai is gonna search his place again,
And if he does not find a jug face, well, then, we wait.
We wait until the pit guides its hand to make another.
My daughter's gonna roam these woods, shunned forever.
Who knows how many others will be taken
'cause of this idiot?
Where are you?!
Tell me where it is!
Please! I'm begging you!
Just tell me where it is!
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it!
I swear I'll do it if you don't tell me.
- What?
- It's me
All right!
Come on check on you.
I want to be alone.
Thought you hated 'shine.
I do.
You found it yet?
It's got to be around here somewhere, right?
Don't!!
I might have left my knife in there.
Let me do something with this.
What is that?
What?
It's a...
Never noticed it before.
I didn't...
I didn't really want you to see that.
Thought we swore we'd never have secrets.
Yeah, right, we didn't, but i... please, don't! Please!
When did you make this?
Couple weeks back. I ain't nobody
'cause ain't nobody got a baby right now.
You think it means something?
I don't really know.
You think that's what the pit wants?
There ain't no baby, so how could it?
Right. That's... that's what I come to.
Makes my head hurt.
If I were you,
I'd think on it real hard,
And maybe you'll see the face again that it showed you.
What if a face I see
Ain't the right one?
Never been wrong before, have you?
Come in here.
Where you been?
I was out, walking.
Where's pa?
He's over at the Jenkins'.
I don't think you'd be too scared out there in them woods yourself.
Must have been an awful sight.
It was.
I'm gonna go to bed.
- I ain't done with you.
- What?
Go in the bathroom.
- No!
- Go, go!
- I want to see.
- See what?
I want to see if you've been fooling around, Before you shame all of us
- Now drop your drawers.
- I'm fine.
I swear!
Get them off and sit your butt down.
Go on. Open up.
Open up.
Do you want me to burn you?
- All righty.
- Stop! Stop!
Now you do as I say.
I ain't kidding around here!
Further!
- You little slut.
- No, I'm not. I'm not. I swear!
- Who is it?
- It ain't nobody! I swear! I swear it ain't nobody!
- Get on the floor!
- Mama please!
- Give me your hand.
- Please, no, no, mama!
Now tell me who it is!
I was just playing with myself.
I swear! I swear! I swear!
I swear on the pit! I swear on the pit!
I promise! I promise!
- It ain't dawai?
- No!
Well, I hope you're right.
I surely do.
Clean yourself up.
Hey, darlin'?
What?
Come on. Roll over.
She tell you?
She did.
I believe you.
Oh, let me see your hand.
She shouldn't have done that.
You know, this is all gonna be over, and you're gonna be on your way to a happy life with Bodey.
What's wrong with her?
Nothing. She's fine.
Don't worry. You're safe.
Don't even try to hold this over me.
There is one thing, though.
Go to sleep.
I'm pregnant.
And I know it's true,
'cause I got one of them tests from town.
Let it be know.
No!
He's all we got!
Sustin, please.
The pit has spoken.
It is an honor to be chosen to be with it in this world... you know that...
For without the blood, the waters of the pit would heal no one.
And so, we do what we must.
Bodey...
Go on, son.
Bodey Jenkin...
Today...
You will pass from this would into its.
Do you give yourself to it?
Yes.
Mama...
It's okay, baby.
Go now with your hearts beating strong
And know that our pact continues.
Grandpa!
Oh!
How long you been like this?
Are you finished?
One... two... three. Up.
Put your hand up.
Watch your head.
No! What do you want?!
Do you know what I am?
You're one of the shunned.
Then, you know you must stop.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No! Please don't hurt him!
It is he who hurt me.
He hid a jug face, same as you.
I forgave, but...
They did not.
They won't forgive you, either.
They did this to Coops?
Poison.
Whose jug face was it?
His wife's.
What if I don't want to die, though?
I have a baby inside me.
You must.
Who's there?
You sure are drinking a lot for someone who don't have a taste for it.
I don't know what I had against it.
It's treating me... treating me just fine.
You want a sip?
I need to talk to you.
But you ain't up for it, I'm thinking.
Everything's all right.
It turned out just fine, didn't it?
Yeah.
Ada? Ada!
What's wrong?
Is Pa inside?
I don't know.
Can I see?
- Pa, I need to talk with you.
- It'll have to wait. I got to see the Corber.
I'm sick.
What?
How long?
A week, maybe.
- You think the pit will heal me?
- If we ask it, it will.
- What if it's too soon?
- That ain't how it works.
- It could still be mad.
- It ain't.
We give it a life when it wants it, and it heals us when we need it.
It's been like that since we first survived the pox.
Now come on. We'll be back.
Strip down...
All the way.
It's gonna work, right?
Don't be scared.
We got to trust in it.
Sit down low.
Get it all over you.
We...
We come to ask for help.
My boy Jessaby is sick,
Ask that you heal him
- So he can serve you better.
- Dawai!
Ow! Help.
And we thank you for all the years you kept us well, and we pray to be chosen.
Stand.
I think I feel it.
Pa!
Come on up here.
Come on.
No.
Ada?
You out here?
I thought I heard you.
Ada?
Ada?!
Ada.
Hey.
You all right?
Jessaby's been taken.
It's all my fault.
Loriss?!
- Loriss?!
- What?
What's happening?
I heard the... horn.
Whose blood is that?
Ada didn't tell you?
Tell me what?
Jessaby was sick.
So, we went to the pit.
No.
It ain't never done this before!
The sacrifice didn't take?
Something ain't right.
The pit wants me...
And my baby.
Baby?
You know that jug face you got in there?
I'm pregnant.
There she is.
Dawai?!
What did you do?!
Pa! No!
Pa, no!
Stop hitting him!
Pa, stop it!
Stop hitting him!
Pa, get off him! Please!
Please, stop hitting him!
He's gonna pay for the deaths he caused!
What the fuck did you do?
I... tell us!
I lost it... the jug face.
I looked everywhere. I did.
And then, when I couldn't find it, uh...
I made another from...
...The person I had in my head.
Motherfucker.
Both my girl and boy are dead 'cause of you!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Get your ass up!
Get up!
Now, because of what dawai has done, it's only fitting he be next.
Once it takes him,
He'll choose the next Potter.
You got anything to say?
I'm real sorry. I am.
Hope you all know that.
Well, you'll have plenty of time to think on it,
As you walk these woods forever,
Shunned like those whose deaths you caused!
I know...
And accept it.
Grandpa...
I got to go.
Now, someone might not come to check on you for a couple days, till they figure out what's going on.
I love you.
Dawai?
- Dawai. Shh!... Shh.
- No!
We're leaving now. We got to hurry.
- What? No.
- You want to die?
It doesn't matter.
It's all right.
This will make it stop.
And then you and your baby will be safe, then.
I ain't gonna have your blood on my hands, too.
You got any 'shine left?
Uh... Yeah, I got a couple jugs.
Get something to put those in.
Why we need these?
For money, unless you got some stashed around here nobody knows about.
No.
You think they've noticed?
Probably.
What's wrong?
I just... Get this bad feeling in the morning.
Oh, right.
Hand me that jug face.
- Well...
- Dawai, give it here.
Nothing's gonna take my baby.
Oh, make him stop.
Make him stop, dawai!
Hello. We need a ride into town?
Can I help y'all?
We need to speak to your pa.
Yeah, sure... one second.
Can I help you?
We got something for you.
We got you some more 'shine.
Y'all ain't supposed to be here till next month.
Yeah, but this is special.
Look. Show him.
Smells the same.
It's real strong! Head peeler!
I don't think so.
Look.
I think we're gonna need to stick to our original agreement, all right?
- I'm gonna have to pass on this, okay?
- No, wait!
Look. I'm real sick.
We need the money so I can see a doctor.
My pa, he don't believe in them.
I'm scared. Please!
- All right.
- Oh, thank you, thank you!
Y'all wait right here, and I'll get you some money, okay?
Y'all thirsty?
You want something to drink?
Yeah, that'd be good, thank you.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
He sure is out.
He's been through a lot.
If there's anything else you need, let me know.
I don't mean to pry, but my dad said you need a doctor.
I know where there's an ob/gyn.
- Hmm?
- A baby doctor.
I saw you with the pregnancy tests the other day.
No, no, no, I'm not.
I'm sorry. I just assumed.
You okay?
- Help me!
- What?
I don't know.
I think she's having a seizure.
- She needs a doctor.
- No doctors.
No, no,
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Please don't tell your pa.
- You need help.
- The people where we're from...
...they want to hurt us.
She's telling you the truth.
I'll make sure you get your money, then.
What'd it show you?
It took Pyer.
Then, you do see through its eyes.
It's punishing me.
Who was that?
How they doing back there?
We have to help them.
You can't get in the middle of these people.
There's some weird shit going on in the woods out there, and we don't want any part of it.
You understand?
Just rest yourself.
It ain't no good for you to be wound up like you are.
This is taking too long.
Well, they said they'd bring the money.
Let's go.
We'll try somewhere else.
Get up! Come on!
Okay.
That's what I figured.
I needed to be calling you.
Those two came in here. They tried to sell some of your moonshine.
Oh, shit!
- What?
- Pa's here!
Ada?
- Ada?!
- Keep your voice down!
How dare you?!
You think you can just turn your back on us?!
They don't care about you out there!
We're all you got!
And I know what you've been doing now.
It's plain as day!
There ain't nothing going on between us! I told you!
Oh, he's good enough for you to run off with?
Then, he's good enough to get in your pussy!
This is for Bodey.
And this is for Eilen.
And this is for my wife.
I'll do her.
Got to start listening, Ada.
Back before, they'd have killed you for less than this.
Your pa, he's gonna work this out, though... what needs to be done for the best of all of us.
What's that mean?
I'll let him explain.
What is wrong with you?
I'm pregnant.
It ain't much of nothing.
She was only two months in.
Well, I shouldn't have beaten her like I did.
You did what was right.
And we don't need another Dawai walking around, no way.
You sure it's him?
Well, whose else would it be?
How you doing?
Why didn't you tell us?
I wouldn't have put you up there and whupped you like that.
I couldn't.
She's ashamed, like she should be.
I can't believe anyone would lie with a fool like that.
It's not dawai's.
Then, whose is it?
It's Jessaby's.
What'd you say?
Why else do you think we took all them walks together?
Hey! Stop! Loriss!
Is what you say true?
Don't you lie to your pa!
I loved him.
Get her out of here!
Shit!
You tell Corber we'll pay him whatever he wants.
Oh, that's right.
We'd already arranged for you to be joined with him.
But he probably won't even want your sorry ass now!
You don't make a squeak!
Maybe we shouldn't even tell Corber.
He'll just say she's ruined, anyway.
I can't believe she'd do this.
I can't...
Woman, will you shut your mouth and let me think?!
Where you going?!
To the pit.
Grandpa?
Where is he?
I need to speak to the shunned boy right now.
You were right!
Is that what you want to hear?
How do I stop it?
You know.
Isn't there some other way?
It's not of this world.
Come on and do it. I'm sitting right here.
What you waiting for, you old pit?
I'm sitting right here.
I ain't scared of you.
I used to be scared of you.
Everybody's so scared of you.
I ain't scared of you no more.
- So, come on.
- Dawai, did you do it?!
What?
You been fucking my daughter?
No!
No, I ain't never... Touched her.
I ain't never done it with nobody.
Did you know she was pregnant?
Was?
You mean, she ain't no more?
You are no longer with child.
Why do you resist?
I don't know.
What?
It's awake.
Well, who do you think it was?
Why are you still alive?
Where's Sustin?
It took him.
I don't know why, but it did.
No!
This whole thing is 'cause of you!
I... I'd trade places with him
You are so dead.
Stop it! It's not his fault!
It's because of me.
It was my jug face.
- I hid it.
- What?
I found the jug face that
Dawai made a few days ago...
And it was mine.
I got scared, so I buried it in the woods.
The one he couldn't find?
I'll take you to it.
Give it to him.
You selfish, little bitch.
Look what all you done.
You almost ruined us, 'cause of what?
'Cause of your dirty, little secret?
Tomorrow, you're gonna make this right in front of everyone!
Tie her with Dawai.
What about our agreement?
The pit wants what it wants.
I'm sorry.
I'd have tried to save my baby, too.
It ain't quite fair, is it?
I reckon they'll do me in after.
Probably.
I don't care.
Tired of them, anyway.
Sleep tight.
What are you doing?
Coops wants you to go.
Wait.
Leave while you can.
What about dawai?
He must stay.
They'll kill him.
Go. Ada, please, just go!
If I give myself, will Dawai be spared?
Yes.
I'm staying, then.
No, you ain't!
You ain't staying. Go.
Ada, go.
Hey, where you all going?
Come back here.
Take her. Hey!
Hey!
Come back here!
Hey!
Ada, I want you to go. I want you to go somewhere, and you live a life.
You can do anything.
You can go to town.
I am doing this for you.
I don't want you to do this for me.
It's what I should have done in the first place.
I can't bear it.
I love you.
Who let her go?
She ain't going anywhere.
Are you ready to give yourself to the pit, once and for all?
Yes.
The pit gives, and the pit takes away.
It is an honor to go be with it, away from this earthly plane.
I hope you are satisfied with our sacrifice.
We understand that the pit wants what it wants.
If you have got anything to say, let it be known.
I just want to say I'm sorry!
I'm sorry for those who died
'cause of what I done.
And I'm sorry to those left behind.
An ordinary university student, Kurono Kei...
...and Katou Masaru, who is working to support his younger brother.
The two people who were childhood friends coincidentally encountered each other again.
And then...
...they died.
The two who were supposed to be dead woke up in an apartment...
...in which a black mysterious sphere called GANTZ is placed.
In that room which they can't get out of, they received a command from GANTZ.
"If you want to go back, go crush this guy."
That was... to battle with the aliens who would invade the Earth...
An inescapable command.
They were then sent to a parallel world...
...and without knowing what was going on, they battled with the aliens.
They barely got their victory.
What awaited Kurono and the others when they returned to the room was...
...were the remarks that GANTZ gave them for battling. and the total points they got for defeating the aliens.
If they get 100 points, they can be released from this world, or revive a beloved person of theirs.
It was a frightening reality.
They have their life all thrown out of order...
...while being able to return to normal life when day comes.
People who were supposed to die...
Kurono, who came to terms with reality while battling...
...and Katou, who continued to deny this battle.
The tough and painful battle goes on anyway.
...and their friends died one by one.
And, in the end, while facing the huge Goddess of Mercy, even Katou's life was taken away.
When Kurono was about to give in to sadness,
Kojima Tae helped him stand on his feet again with her honest feelings.
He swore in his heart that he would earn
100 points in order to revive Katou.
In a battle that sees no end, he's determined to continue fighting.
Let's go!
"Thank you for the hard work.
I'm Yoshioka."
"Tomorrow, the studio has delayed the schedule to an hour later,"
"so I will come to fetch you at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning."
"It's 8 o'clock, so the time's later than the previous schedule by an hour."
"That's all for now.
Thank you very much."
"At 10:29 p.m."
The message is over.
[Thank you for your hard work last night.]

Soon it will be five months since the day the National Museum was collapsed, and yet the cause of the incident still remains unknown.
According to the police, there's a possibility that it's an act of terrorism.
- Is the burger done?
- Yes, coming.
I'll take this.
Please.
- Please help me with the tomatoes.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Oh, Kei-chan.
- How's your homework?
- I'm done.
You're not.
But it's so interesting, Tae-chan.
Hey, Koruhi is written based on Kei-chan, right?
I didn't mean that...
Are you embarrassed?
Yeah. This manga is interesting, right?
She can even get the Rookie of the Year award.
I'm nowhere near good yet.
I have to improve my skills.
You're good already.
I'm no good yet.
There are a lot of better people.
I said you're gonna be fine.
Ah~ I want to show this to Nii-chan too.
He's not coming back yet?
Oh, maybe a little more.
It's really because of his job, right?
Of course.
Oi, don't take your time in there.
Where is he really?
Ayumu-kun's brother.
Sorry.
I heard from Ayumu-kun that the same thing happened before.
That time, his brother was arrested by the police.
Katou's not that kind of person.
This.
The pay for this month.
I don't need it, really.
Well you see, you don't have to pay for the rents here, right?
However, I want you to come to this house for a while more.
Of course I will.
If I'm not with him, he won't do his homework.
Ayumu is good at cooking anyway.
Well, I can't deny that.
Also...
If I come here,
I can see Kurono-kun too.
Wa-wait. Please don't keep quiet.
It was what I'm gonna draw just now.
I was thinking of how to put in this particular romantic scene.
Well, I have to get going.
Eh?
I thought you were gonna stay?
Ah, someone just called me suddenly.
Kojima-san, you can just stay over.
Hold on a second.
Huh?
"The train will be coming to the first line soon."
"Since it's dangerous, please stand behind the yellow line."
You were chosen too, weren't you?
You will not get used to it at first, so feel free to just watch what we do.
Kobayashi-san is the same as you.
[It's completely up to me how
I want to use you people's lives.]
I'm sorry for startling you.
There's something I want to ask you, so will you give me some of your time?
Since you abruptly announced your break from activities, there have been many speculations going around, haven't there?
Rumors have it that it could be due to your illness, marriage, pregnancy, or your move to overseas.
But I've dug up everything.
You're from the media?
The motive is unknown but there is an incredible sequence of events that've been happening.
People who are supposed to die from accidents have their bodies suddenly vanish from the scene.
The day just goes on as if nothing happened.
And then, for some reason, that night, there will definitely be...
...some destruction occurring somewhere in Tokyo.
Don't you know about this?
No.
Well then, how about that rumor?
The rumor about the black sphere...
...and the room that contains it...
You know it, don't you?
Then, four.
You can ask me four questions.
Your aim.
Why are you all gathering at this place?
We're searching for the black ball.
Black ball?
If we have it, we can go where we want.
You mean the room that contains the black sphere?
You know it, huh.
Where did you hear about it?
I came here today to ask about that.
Where is that room?
It's not in this reality.
What do you mean?
You can't to go to that room if it's not necessary.
Who are you people?
That's the fifth question.
Why are you chasing after the same incident as I do?
Sixth one.
What do you want exactly?
If you want to know, investigate this one more person and come back here.
Why don't you go somewhere together once in a while?
You and Kei-chan.
Focus.
Why? You two are dating, right?
We are not.
How come? You confessed to him, right?
Until your brother comes back, Kurono-kun...
Seems that he can't think of any other thing.
But I'm fine.
When things calm down,
I'll try asking him once.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Ok! Homework.
[Total 94 points. 6 points until it's over]
It's gonna be soon, huh?
Yes.
Let me go!
Where's the heck is this place?
- Where am I?
- Please calm down.
Speaking of which, who are you people?
Who cares about that.
I was an office worker.
For the last 20 years, I have worked for the company every day.
Well, I was dismissed because of a restructure though.
I'm a nurse.
That's during the day.
At night, she's a hostess.
You lie about you age, right?
This auntie's still popular at this age.
Can you believe it?
He's women's enemy even during the day.
I'm a freeter. Right now, I'm working part-time at a curry shop.
It's a small shop, but the food is delicious.
I'm a system engineer at this company named Orient.
Please contact me if need be.
And, how about you?
I'm a hairdresser.
Kurono-san is really a normal university student?
Since... you're really strong and everything.
He is, indeed.
Why are you so strong?
Because there's someone I want to revive.
GANTZ.
He was one of us before.
He fought with us.
Kurono-kun wants to revive him.
But... not only him.
I want to revive everyone who's died here.
And then, let us all be released from here and become free together.

Did you come on time the other day?
Hmm? For what?
Your part-time job?
Part-time...? Oh, yeah I did.
Tough, isn't it?
It is. There is this person named Suzuki, and for some reason she didn't turn up.
That's why the shop didn't have enough people, so they just called me out.
What's wrong?
Kurono-kun, did something good happen?
There's something, right?
You can tell?
What? What?
Well actually, I was gonna tell Ayumu.
Katou is gonna come home soon.
Eh?
He's been contacting you?
Hm?
Katou asked me...
...to keep it from other people.
I see.
More importantly, there's some information
I want to give Kojima-san...
Well, "information" isn't exactly the word...
Wanna go to amusement park?
Let's go?
Just the two of us, once in a while.
You mean... that time I confessed to you?
That was...
I told you it was just at the surge of the moment.
Please forget about it.
How can I forget it?
Hey, let's go.
Impossible, impossible.
Absolutely impossible.
I have acrophobia.
I can't handle the ferris wheel or roller coaster at all...
Look.
You even drew it in your sketchbook, right?
The scene at the amusement park?
Maybe if you go there, it can become your source to draw manga.
Then...
There's one condition.
What is it?
Please start calling me by my first name from now on.
Eh?
Call me now.
Please.
Well, that's a little...
Maybe now is not the right time.
The next time we meet,
I'll call you that, ok?
I'll definitely call you that when we met at the amusement park.
Yes.
Definitely.
See you.
Welcome back, Kei-chan.
How are you alive?
GANTZ did something?
You don't remember?
How many people are there?
Eight people, including me.
Recently, we got three more people.
GANTZ...
I want to put an end to it.
How?
You don't know?
There's a ball this big.
No idea.
I'll come again.
If you know something, tell me.
GANTZ, show me people who've died.
What's the matter?
Katou was revived.
Eh? How come?
Well, I don't know about that.
But look, he's still in here.
What is going on?
[Katou]
Who...
Nii-chan?
What?
Um...
I'm Kojima, Kurono-kun's classmate at the college.
Ayumu-kun, come see him.
Ayumu-kun?
What's so important that you even neglect your younger brother?
It's because you have work to do, right?
I'm asking you, Nii-chan.
Because I have work.
Really?
Really.
Oh, yeah?
Should I go back?
There are things you can't talk when I'm here, so...
I'm taking my leave.
I'm glad for you, Ayumu-kun.
[Welcome back, Nii-chan]
I memorized how to make it when you weren't home.
Try it.
You're the first person I made it for.
This is Kojima.
Erm, Ayumu-kun's brother came home earlier.
And also, there's something I want to ask...
About the amusement park, Ayumu-kun and his brother are coming too...
That's why, it won't be a date.
I want to see you.
Can I go to your workplace right now?
[Kojima Tae]
[Kojima Tae]

Where's this place?
A train?
Something is fishy.
Hey, you...
Have we ever met long before?
It moved.
It's the subway!
What?
The subway?
Everyone, don't space out.
"The train will be departing soon."
There are people here.
This has never happened before, right?
Take care of the front part of the train.
Ayukawa Eriko?
She's riding the train by herself?
Everyone, we are not a suspicious group of people.
We are not doing anything to harm you either.
What? Is it like an event or something?
Kurono-san!
Don't shoot!
Don't drag others into this!
Can you hear people screaming?
It smells weird too.
What the? What's going on?
Isn't this dangerous?
Takahashi!
You guys are so amazing.
Damn it.
I remember...
I remember!
I remember.
I've done the same thing before.
What?
The two who were in the room before,
Nakamura-san and Kobayashi-san too.
Eh?
Stop! It's dangerous here!
Out of the way!
Come.
Kurono Kei.
Kurono-kun?
Run away from here.
Wait.
Sorry.
Stop it!
You're heavy. Move aside.
I'm covering for you.
She's tough.
Yeah.
This is revenge.
This is revenge.
You people were the ones who started this first.
You people have killed so many of my friends.
I'll never forgive you-
Everyone's safe, right?
Auntie isn't here.
[Well then, let's see the points]
Hold on a second.
Oi!
[Well then, let's see the points]
[Takahashi]
[0 point. Total 88 points]
What the heck is this?
Oi.
I told you Auntie isn't here.
Auntie isn't here!
Auntie isn't here!
Auntie isn't here!
[Good work. You got the first key.]
[Kobayashi]
[The second key]
[Yamamoto]
[You got the second key.]
"You know it, don't you?"
"The black sphere... and the room that contains it."
Black sphere?
Room?
GANTZ!
[It totally depends on me how to use your life]
[That's on theory.]
This is revenge.
You people killed my friends.
[Sakurai]
[0 point. Total 69 points]
Auntie's here, isn't she?
That's her, right?
Is this for real?
Isn't that Ayukawa?
Ayukawa... Eriko?
You finally came, huh?
Yes.
Seems so.
[Well then, let's continue with the points]
Everyone, please be careful.
This woman... was the one who killed me.
Long time no see, Kobayashi-san.
Huh?
Kobayashi-san, don't you remember this room?
You don't remember me?
Huh? What?
[Kobayashi]
[0 point. Totally doesn't remember a thing]
Two years ago...
I fought while protecting you.
[Nakamura]
[0 point]
Yamamoto, Ayukawa, you, and I...
We defeated these aliens dressed in black...
...two years ago in Shibuya.
[Yamamoto]
[11 points]
And then, everyone could stop doing this.
We had our memory erased... and were set free.
Ah...
Yes.
So if we get 100 points, we can really be released, huh?
[Suzuki]
[17 points. Total 101 points]
100 points.
"Breaking news. There is an emergency going on currently."
"An accident occurred at the subway, causing 84 people to die and 260 people injured."
"A group of people bearing weapons were seen on the train."
"The cause is also unknown this time."
[100 points menu]
[1. Erase all your memory and get released]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
That means you'll be released.
Suzuki-san, with this, you'll be a free man.
I'll choose the second option.
[2. Return the person you love to life]
I'm sorry.
First of all, let's revive Katou-kun.
No...
But, he...
I was... killed by him.
"This is revenge. You people killed my friends."
He said that and killed me.
That's the same thing as what the girl said earlier.
Then... this Katou is?
Let's confirm it.
GANTZ.
Please revive Katou Masaru-kun.
Eh? That's it?
Kei-chan.
Where's the alien?
Katou.
Katou.
Katou!
Oi GANTZ. Hurry up!
You mustn't die.
I'll wait for you.
I'll go first and wait for...
Kei-chan.
What about the alien?
What happened to it?
Was I... dead?
Was I alive?
I'm alive, and I can go back.
Suzuki-san used his points to revive you.
It's nothing. Well, it's been my objective from the beginning...
...to get 100 points and revive Katou-kun.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much!
Ah, it's nothing.
Anyway, with this, we've made it clear, right?
Yes.
The other guy is an alien.
We will avenge you.
I have obtained the key to that room.
[Kurono]
[21 points. Total 115 points]
More than 100 points.
GANTZ, I choose number 2.
[100 points menu]
[1. Erase all your memory and get released]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
[2. Return the person you love to life]
The person I want to revive is...
Huh?
I have you revived.
I was dead?
Yeah.
That's so uncool!
Right now, you're important to us.
Now, explain to us.
Something strange is happening to GANTZ.
You guys...
Long time no see.
You're still doing this, huh?
Why are you here?
We were summoned by GANTZ.
A black ball was sent to my place.
Ex-members like us were brought back here.
That's not the only thing.
There were people who were dragged into the mission and got killed.
This has never happened before.
Say, what's going on now?
How long have I been dead?
Five months.
It's gathering people because of this?
What is it?
Oi, spill it.
GANTZ runs using battery.
Huh?
This thing runs using battery?
From what I observe, even though this is just a guess...
GANTZ moves by sucking his energy.
That's why, if this bald-headed guy wakes up, it's also the end of GANTZ.
If GANTZ dies, what will happen to us?
That is...
Right?
Extermination... perhaps.
We, who were revived by GANTZ...
...will also disappear together with it.
What the heck is that?
Maybe GANTZ is rushing too.
Before its lifetime ends, it wants to defeat all the aliens.
That's why it summoned us ex-members here.
I see what you mean.
So it's like homecoming, huh?
Perhaps...
...the archrival still remains.
The Last Boss, that is.
Don't tell me...
...that is...?
Today I met an alien who appeared in the form of your body.
Eh?
The one who killed me is also...
...that guy.
He's an alien.
There it goes again.
"A new morning has come"
"It's a morning of hope"
"Open your heart with joy"
Today's mission just ended though.
"Look up to the blue sky"
"Listen to the radio"
"Take a deep breath"
"And take in the fragrance of the wind"
"And then - one, two, three"
[Emergency mission]
[Go crush this person]
[Kojima Tae]
[Special trait: Weak]
[Favorite thing: Kurono-kun]
What the heck?
An ordinary girl?
Wait, look...
Her favorite thing is...
What the heck is this?
Why is she the target?
Shouldn't it be that fake Katou?
[People who crushed her will get 100 points.]
[The others will have their points taken away.]
This girl is...
Kojima Tae is not an alien.
That's why...
...please don't kill her.
Please.
She may look like that, but she might actually be an alien.
That's not true!
The last person who appeared on the black ball...
...was this girl.
So that means... she's also an ex-member of the group?
No. I've never seen her.
Then... she's really an alien?
Hang on.
Where is that ball now?
The one who killed me...
So it's with that Katou alien, huh?
Isn't that bad?
Maybe he already killed
Kojima Tae before us.
The ones who hold the ball can be transmitted around.
Seriously?
GANTZ wants to prevent that, right?
Anyway...
...if it's GANTZ's order, we just have to do it.
If I can get 100 points by killing this one girl,
I'll kill Kojima Tae.
GANTZ.
Transmit me first.
Kei-chan.
I'll go to Kojima-san.
You go to Ayumu's place.
Sorry. I'll see you later.
Be careful.
Wait.
You intend to protect her?
I want to revive Auntie.
That's why...
...I have to gain more points.
Stop it!
Transmit me quickly.
GANTZ!
My house?
I will explain everything to you later.
Right now, let's run away together.
Um, what happened in the subway earlier...
It didn't make any sense at all.
But I believe...
I believe you, Kurono-kun.
This way!
Wasn't that Ayumu-kun's brother?
It wasn't him!
Urgent! Urgent! Calling headquarters.
Found one suspect just now.
The suspect is heading towards the north direction.
The suspect is a man who possesses a weapon and is chasing after someone else.
Quickly send more backups to the subway.
"Roger."
Found you.
Kurono-kun.
Let's stop this.
If GANTZ dies, everyone will be exterminated.
Doing this to another human being is just strange.
Though you can kill so many aliens?
Suzuki-san.
Since I'm thrown into this, before GANTZ comes to an end,
I will get 100 points one more time.
Nice.
Kurono-san.
Run away.
If you move, we'll shoot.
No, you won't.
Suzuki-san too!
Me too?
They're shooting!
Please go first.
I will block them.
Sakurai-kun!
They won't get any points killing me.
Hurry up! I'll catch up with you later.
Thanks.
I'll aim at him for real.
Let's go.
[Katou]
Ayumu.
Ayumu!
Ayumu.
Ayumu.
Ayumu...
Calling headquarters.
Right now, the suspect is heading further to the north direction.
I'm chasing after him.
It's me, Kei-chan.
By any chance...
...he is...?
Suzuki-san.
The two of you, please get as far away from Tokyo as you can.
Hurry up!
I don't want to go!
I want to be with you, Kurono-kun.
Tae-chan.
I will definitely come pick you up later.
Let's go.
Let's make sure...
...we go to the amusement park.
This way!
Don't... get in my way.
You came to take revenge?
Why did you... have to kill Ayumu?
You also killed your father.
Give Ayumu back!
Someone who killed his father like you...
...can get angry when your brother is killed?
Because of those emotions... you killed your father.
That was to save Ayumu.
It couldn't be helped!
It couldn't be helped?
That's forever your excuse.
You always make that excuse... and run away from everything.
Katou!
Kei-chan.
Please tell me.
What's happening to Kurono-kun?
It's hard to explain, but...
He's fighting...
...to protect you.
For... my sake?
He might... even die.
I'm sorry.
My wife passed away.
I want to get her back.
I have to gain enough points before GANTZ is over.
Please run away.
If not, I will have to shoot you.
Kurono-kun will definitely come to pick you up.
It doesn't work on him at all.
This way!
You're in the way. Move aside!
I give up!
Let's stop.
Let's stop here.
Okay?
What are you shooting?
But...
But...
...he-
[Kojima Tae] someone saying something the same someone saying something again
Oi.
Oi!
Oi!!
You want to know why I killed your brother?
This is revenge.
You people did the same thing to me.
We tasted the same hatred...
...and sorrow.
Like me, you people are...
...not fighting for anyone's sake,
Nor are you protecting anyone.
You're just...
...being controlled by that black sphere.
Katou.
Kurono-kun!
No way...
Kurono-kun.
I got you.
Kurono-kun.
Tae-chan.
Let's go home.
You mustn't...
You mustn't die.
Kei-chan.
Kei-chan.
So you're saying that I should keep...
...fighting until forever?
That's why, you...
...made Tae-chan your target?
You can go to that room using it, right?
Hand the ball to me.
[Mission cleared.]
[Damn it Damn it Damn it]
[Someone, crush the alien in this room]
In here?
Not here.
The ones who were supposed to have been killed by the alien earlier are...
We finally found you.
It is you who wished to start this fight.
[Start]
I understand now, GANTZ.
[Choose]
Kei-chan.
How about the aliens?
I don't think all of them have died.
That's great.
That's great?
Because we have to get more points.
What do humans fight for?
What do you people fight for?
For the sake of my loved ones.
When are you gonna keep fighting until?
Until... I can revive my wife.
Stop it.
I have to live.
I...
People in this world are longing to see me.
You're kidding, right?
GANTZ.
Stop it.
Shoot.
I can't stop this fight with you people.
Shoot!
Stop...
...already
Let's... stop this.
Why?
There's no way but to kill him.
Kei-chan.
[Well then, let's see the points]
[Kurono]
[Full points]
[Please choose from the "full points" menu.]
[Full points menu~]
[Forever...]
Oi! What's next?
What is it?
GANTZ is...
...over?
With this...
...no one will be revived.
Neither will us.
No.
There's still... a way out.
Kei-chan.
GANTZ...
...has decided already.
[Kurono-kun]
[Thank you]
Kei-chan?
What did you do?
Everything will end.
No one will be summoned here anymore.
You've gotta be kidding me!
What did you do?
Katou.
Thank you so much...
...for remembering our childhood together.
I...
...was really happy.
But...
...from now on, forget about me.
How can I forget?
How can I forget??
Katou.
Take good care of Ayumu.
We're going back together!
Together!
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan!
Thank you very much.
Wanna buy something?
- Yeah, buy me a map.
- Okay.
- I'll take them.
- Oh, thanks.

I keep having this dream...
where I wake up in my bed...
and all I can hear is this yapping.
I go in the hall...
and I see this guy sitting in a chair.
He's got a cap on him and his head's down...
so I can't see his face.
I yell at him...
but the guy won't look at me.
And the yapping is getting louder and louder.
I walk down and say,
'Hey mate, you alright?'
And he just sits there, says nothing.
I lift his head up with my hands...
and he's got this cut across his neck.
It looks like a big fucking mouth.
I lean down closer...
and I see this Chihuahua...
sitting inside his neck...
looking back at me...
yapping.
Yapping at me.

Here's an example how the system's fucked, right?
And I know you can go along with this, Nige...
because this has happened to your boys, hasn't it?
- Yes.
- JOHN: Now here we go.
They've got a police check, don’t they?
To get into teaching at schools, right?
- MAN: Yep, and working.

So Claire across the road, right?
We all know her.
She's a great girl, she's been studying for six years,
She's been studying to be a teacher.
She goes to get a fucking job, she can't get a job... because she stole a fucking watch when she was 18.
But Mr. Fucking Bum Puncher, your mates, mate.
BARRY: No, they're not my mates.
No, they're all your fucking friends,

There's your fucking keys.
The gents are just down the hall.

- WOMAN: Have a smorgasbord, mate.
And what did the school do about that?
NIGEL: The school? The school actually did absolutely nothing.
Nothing.
I honestly don't see an answer to any of our questions.
- MAN: And when you--
- I don't see a solution to any of it.
I'm fuckin' sick to death of it,
I really am.
I've had a gutful, and sitting around here talking about it,
it's all great, we're all venting.
That's fucking fantastic.
But it's happening right fuckin' now, right while we're sitting here.
Some little kid's being touched up.
WOMAN: But how difficult--

I really don't want you here.

JOHN: How are you, mate?

BARRY: You can't blame every gay for being a paedophile.
I want to ask you a question.
Yes, you can.
Our queer friend here...
thinks that it's okay for poofter teachers to teach at school.
What do you think about that?
- I don't know.
- Go on, mate.
Tell us what you really think.
We're all friends here.
I don't think they should be doing that.
Don't think they should be doing that, do you?
Touching up your friends.
Stay behind class, please,
I need to see ya.
That's not fucking right, is it?
BARRY: Well some boys know what they want, don't they?
Shut up, Barry.
VERNA: They're children.

What should happen to 'em?

I bet you after you kick the shit--
I bet you after you kick the shit out of that fucking pedo...
he's gonna put his cock away, and he didn't touch no other kid after.
And that's exactly what me and Rob are doing, aren't we mate?
- Right on.
- You know what I mean?
VERNA: There should be more people like me doing it.
- You're right.
- There should be more people like you.
I mean, you should see the hours that we put in.
You gotta take it into your own hands.

Mate, do you know,
I don't know if you've felt it before but...
the last romantic thing I can remember doing, bro,
you know, like I say, it's been a while, and I wined and dined her, you know, did the whole nine yard thing.
Hmm...
I booked a hotel on
Glen Osmond Road, took her to a hotel- I think it's called Eagle On The Hill, right?
It's a real classy restaurant dude, right?
Cost me hundreds of dollars obviously to pay for it.
But she was worth it, mate.
She was beautiful, you know what I mean?
- I loved her.
- Yeah, I know.
Yeah, wined and dined her, you know what I mean?
And afterwards, I think it's called
Windy Point, or whatever it is.
- It's a lookout, right?
- Up in the hills?
Up in the hills, alright?
Which was beautiful, know what I mean?
Got into each other, got a little bit heated, you know what I mean?
But in that loving, caring, sort of nurturing feeling way.
Yeah, yeah.
And umm...
And took her back to the hotel room, and you know, it wasn't fucking, you know, and see you later.
There was something more to it, you know?
Substance, mate. Substance.
I miss it.

And she had this boyfriend, partner, thing, whatever.
And she actually found that guy in bed with her daughter.
JOHN:
How old was his daughter?
She was about six or seven at the time.
She kicked him out for maybe,
I don't know, 48 hours... then took him back into her home with that daughter... and just let him live there.
Just let that fucker live in her house.
JOHN: You wouldn't do that, would ya?
- VERNA: Fuck no.
- JOHN: What would you do?
VERNA: Oh, first chance
I got, I would fucking...
probably skin his penis.
What about you, Nigel?
What would you do, mate?

There's something else you'd do before that, wouldn't you?

Yeah. Break every fuckin' bone in his body.
Cut his cock off, shove it in his mouth. See ya later.

You wanna say something, Troy?
MAN: People like that just walk away.
VERNA: Exactly. People that walk away and shut their fucking eyes -
MARCUS: He's the smart one.
VERNA: Why is he the smart one, walking away?
He's just shutting his eyes to something that's so real and out there.
No, he just doesn't need to be here, listening to all this... bravado about what you do.
Like, honestly.
Would you do that shit?
I came here for dinner, alright?
VERNA: Well you had your dinner, now fuck off.

This is my pet python snake.
It's a ju-jungle python snake.
It comes from the ah, top of Queensland.
It's a bit nasty, and um, it's about two years old... and you can buy these um, rats from a pet store.
It's about five dollars a-a box.
Yeah, anyway...
Would you like to s-see me um, feeding the snake, Jamie?

If you manned up once in a while I wouldn't have to.
Oh for fuck's sake, just do it, will ya?
Alright kids, out!
Out.
Out back.
We'll leave the boys alone to talk about their private girly business.

Jesus, mate, you're going to have to put a leash on that.
MARK: You got one big enough?
JOHN: I could make one.
Might take a while, but.
MARK: I've been meaning to talk to you about that, John.
JOHN: Why is that?
Me and Verna got into a bit of a blue the other night.
Drunk, carrying on.
She ended up starting to call me names.
You know, saying I was a pussy and I don't fuck her properly.
Do you, mate?
Well, how do you, really?
You tell me.
Roll her around first in flour to find the wet spot.
- You alright, mate?
- Yeah.
We got bluing and... when she called me a pussy, it just sort of come out.
I said, 'if I'm a pussy, why is it that I can bury blokes?'
So she sort of knows what's going on, John.
And I told her, mate.
I said, look, if you say anything to anyone...
I'll put you and the kids out in the streets.
She won't say nothing, mate.
So I feel really shit.
Just really sorry, John.
She won't say anything, mate.
- Promise ya.
- It's alright, mate.
- Sorry, John. I feel awful.
- Don't worry about it.
It happens.
You look like a fucking ghost hit ya.
Yeah.
Oi.
It's alright to smile.
[MARK LAUGHS AWKWARDLY]
I dare you to.
So how do ya fuck her, mate?
Step ladder.
Bucket.
Pull the bucket over her head and hang on to the handle.
[LAUGHS LOUDLY]
It's strange, but Australia Post want to give her her own postcode.
[JOHN & ROBERT LAUGH]
- There ya go, mate.

No, you spend some time with your family, mate.

You fucking get off that shit.
Alright?
You fuckin' get off that shit.
Okay?

Look at me.
You don't need to worry, alright?
They're nobody, mate.
No one gives a shit.
They're nothing.
The neighbours barely fucking notice when they go missing.
You did though, didn't you?
And your brothers.
You're lucky.
Aren't ya?
Good.
It's alright, mate.
Good boy.
It's alright.
I need you.
Better blow your fucking nose.
Go on.
I need you to take Alex away.

Um, Dr. Dutten,
- my aunt's in town.
- Mm-hmm.
And she's sick, too.
I'm gonna need you to stay late tonight.
- Oh. You are?
- You know, you should probably text your Aunt Scotty and tell him you can't make it to the baseball game today.
Wait a second.
- Okay, look, Scotty and I, we're not-
- Oh, come on, Becca.
- I mean-
- It's the worse-kept secret in town.
Now, that is saying a lot.
Go on.
Get outta here.
Go have some fun.
Thanks, Dr. Dutten.
Well, I don't care what the calendar says.
Opening day-
That's the first day of spring.
No, no, no.
The sheriff never pays for coffee.
Well, that's kind of you, Ben.
But the principal still has to pay his parking tickets.
- Start him a tab.
- Yes, sir.
Kid throws fast.
Just like he drives.
Nice pitch, Scotty.
Come on, man! Come on, guys!
Strike two!
Whoo! Yeah!
Center field.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Hey, Tommy!
- Stay there.
- What's he doing?
- Boys, get in the dugout.
- Move it off.
- Get off!
- Bring it in. Bring it in.
Get them off the field.
Get them in the dugout, Principal.
Rory. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Rory, we got a ballgame going on here.
We're playing ball, and you come out with a gun?
What the hell are you doing?
Aw, Ror.
You're drunk, that's all.
All right? Let's just lay the gun down.
Rory, lay the gun down.
Hmm? Lay it down.
Hell, Rory, come on.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Rory?
Now, you lay that gun down.
Rory?
Oh, my God.
I'll have blood alcohol for you in the morning.
A full tox screen will take about a week.
How are you holding up, David?
Peggy here yet?
She just walked in with her boy.
David, perhaps now is not the best time.
Son, settle down.
Hey, Curt.
Uh...
I'm so sorry.
I liked Rory. I liked him a lot.
What was he doing out there?
He had been drinking, that's all.
Rory quit two years ago.
You know how proud he was of that.
Is that what you're saying, that he was drunk?
- Is that what you're telling people?
- No.
That you had to do it- had to shoot the town drunk.
You did the right thing.
I need a new blade for this.
Hey, David.
You did the right thing.
You should be sleeping.
Sheriff's Department.
No, ma'am, we can't comment on that.
That's an ongoing investigation.
No, ma'am, the sheriff is not here right now, but I can see if the deputy will-
Amateur.
Sheriff's Department.
Mm-hmm.
That's the medical examiner on line two.
Morning, Jim.
What have we got?
The toxicology reports are in.
The results are negative.
- Come again?
- There was no alcohol-
No, I heard what you said,
Jim, but that's not right.
- Rory was-
- David, we did the test twice.
Rory wasn't drunk.
There was no alcohol in his bloodstream.
We'll get the drug results back in a couple of days, maybe a week.
Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Do you want this car...
Bring it down here.
Ben?
Ben!
Hey.
Hey, Ben. Ben!
Ben!
Hey. You all right?
Don't worry. The, uh... kids are resilient.
They're gonna be all right.
Yeah.
I'm late. I gotta go.
- Deardra. Bill.
- Hey, Judy.
Little man.
How y'all doing?
Uh, would you mind taking a look at Bill?
- Sure. What's wrong?
- I don't know.
He's just-
He's not right.
How are you feeling, Bill?
Any pain or discomfort?
Bill?
She worries too much. I'm fine.
Just a little tired.
You got any plans this weekend?
She worries too much. I'm fine.
Just a little tired.
His vitals are fine.
But, you know, I've gotta see a patient in Cedar Rapids on Monday.
I wanna take Bill in to get a CT scan.
- Monday?
- Yeah.
Let's just make sure it's nothing serious.
- Okay.
- Okay?
You need me, you call me.
Day or night.
- Okay?
- Thanks, Judy.
See you, Nicholas.
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Bill!
What's Dad doing?
Wait here, Nicholas.
William!
William?
William, what are you doing?
William?
William!
Oh, God.
Nicholas!
Nicholas?
Nicholas.
Nicholas!
- Nicholas, are you okay?
- Shh, shh.
Nicholas, what happened?
It's Dad.
Wh-Where's Dad?
What happened?
Honey, please, talk to me.
Please.
He has a knife.
Oh, my God.
Stay back.
Stay right there.
William!
William!
William!
William, please, don't do this!
William, please let us out!
Hello.
Mmm.
I'm coming.
What is it?
Number 1, take the full pressure.
All right, team.
Get me some power.
- Oh, my God.
- The garage is lit up, too.
- Deardra!
- Tom, they get out?
Not Deardra and Nicholas.
Just Bill.
- I need two men on that Engine 3 quarter, south side.
- On it.
When we got here, there was an empty gas can just sitting out front.
And Bill- Well, he was mowing the goddamn lawn.
David, Deardra and Nicholas were upstairs locked inside a closet.
Bill! Bill!
Bill?
What the hell happened here?
- Oh, my God.
- Judy.
Oh, God.
- Judy, come on.
- No.
- What the fuck have you done?
- Judy, come on.
- Oh! Oh, David!
- Shh.
Oh, God!
Deardra!
Oh, my God!
Deardra!
What the hell?
What the hell?
What you got?
Shit!
Oh, my God.
Russ, you get in touch with Sheriff Byrnes in Cedar Rapids?
- Russ?
- Uh, yeah.
State troopers are coming this afternoon to pick him up for transfer.
How long has he been playing statue?
A couple hours now.
The same look Rory gave me.
The same goddamn look.
Shit.
Sheriff's Department.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Slow down.
Been there at least a week by the looks of things.
I'll check to see if there's any identification.
Yeah.
Do that.
Boys, last I checked, hunting season ended three months ago.
We was just out taking in a little nature.
- Fresh air is all.
- Guns away till fall.
- Aw, come on, Sheriff.
- What, are you kidding me?
- What's with this guy?
- Well, we got us a pilot.
Where's the plane?
You know, last week,
Travis Quinn was going around saying he heard something crash out by Hautman Bog.
- I didn't think nothing of it.
- On account of him being full of shit?
As a general rule.
- Well, maybe there's the exception.
- Maybe.
You said it sounded like a plane, Trav?
Sheriff, about the reward-
Shit. Big plane? Little plane?
What? Come on now.
If you can explain the difference how those two sound,
- I might be able to figure it out.
- You're full of shit.
He's full of shit.
People only ask for a reward when there's something to find.
Is it gonna be a big reward, Sheriff?
Travis, you ask about that again,
I'm gonna throw you out of the fucking boat.
You're not gonna shoot me?
Travis.
Yeah?
Kill the engine.
It was a big plane, Russ.
Why is that?
'Cause we're right on top of it.
Kevin, which way does the water flow through town?
Nice to see you, too, Dave.
Waste water or drinking?
- Drinking.
- Give me a second.
A plane that size goes down- nothing in the paper, nothing in the news.
- Make any sense to you?
- It depends on what the payload is.
Exactly what I'm thinking.
Which is what?
Hautman Bog-
What's that drain into?
- Dwyer Creek.
- Which drains into?
Black Pond. Oh, hey, you remember monster catfish-
Russell, where do you think we get our drinking water from?
Treated water comes in from the north, breaks east-west.
And what house does it get to first?
Uh, let's see.
Rory Hamill.
You wanna shut off the entire town's water supply on a hunch?
Mayor, I've got three dead bodies in the morgue in the last 48 hours.
David, take a look around you.
This is a farming community.
It is springtime.
It is planting season.
You turn off the water, you're gonna kill the crops.
You kill the crops, and you bankrupt every family in Pierce County.
And that is not based on some, uh, hunch.
That's a fact.
Water stays on.
Uh, Sheriff,
I'm all for a little civil disobedience, but, um, I think this one might cost you your job.
You know what, Russ?
That wouldn't be such a bad thing.
What the fuck?
Shh. Hang on a second.
Well, is he dead?
Well, if he is, he won't mind waiting.
Oh! Jesus Christ!
Did we or did we not request a transfer for him this morning?
Mm-hmm.
God damn it.
Even better.
- You know what?
- What?
We're in trouble.
Hello?
Jim?
Jim?
Jesus Christ.
Behind you.
Christ Almighty.
David, I'm not gonna do this.
I can't go to my parents.
- You have no idea-
- And neither do you.
Look, whatever it is,
I can't just leave.
- Are you gonna leave?
- I'm the sheriff.
- I'm their doctor.
- Yeah, well, if it turns out what they need is penicillin,
I'll call you.
David.
What?
What?
There's somebody outside.
David!
Get on the ground!
This is secure.
All right! Let's go, men! Move it!
Come on. Let's go.
Keep it moving.
Sheriff, what's going on?
- I don't know any more than you do.
- Keep moving, sir.
Please take the first open seat.
A funny thing happened on the way to Cedar Rapids.
Bastards spiked my tires.
Who are these fuckers, man?
Keep moving.
Everyone must exit the bus.
Keep moving, please.
Let's go, let's go!
Stay in line, sir.
Keep up with the group, please.
Please head into the tent.
- There is no need for alarm.
- Inside, please.
Forward, please.
- Please keep moving into the tent.
- Please step forward.
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.
Hey, can one of you guys tell me what's going on?
- I'm sorry. You're gonna have to keep moving.
- Sir, come with me.
- Let's go!
- No!
- Russell!
- Don't touch me!
- Coming through!
- The temperature spiked.
- Ma'am-
- What are you people doing?
Judy- Hey, don't touch me.
- Hey!
- Both of you, out!
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.
- Go ahead. This way, please.
- Judy, what does it mean?
- They're checking for elevated temperatures.
- Clear.
Farnum was bleeding from the nose.
So was Rory.
Well, cerebral hemorrhaging-
It's gotta be some kind of virus.
- You gotta wait here.
- Look, I'm a sheriff.
- She's a doctor. We know these people.
- Clear.
Would you just tell us what's going on?
Maybe we can actually help you.
- Take her in there!
- David!
Go, go, go!
David!
Get off me! Stop!
David! Wait! Wait!
Stand back! Now!
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

Wait!
David! David!
Judy!

Please.
Please help me.

We got Trayberg scrubbed and ready.
Let's go, let's go.
Please. Please.
Don't. Please. Don't.
No.
No. Please.
Please. I'm pregnant.
Please! No!
Let's go!
Franklin, open these doors!
Quickly, people.
We're getting you outta here.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Keep moving!
- Come on!
Let's go, let's go.
Extend your right arm, please, sir. Let's go.
You'll be given a card.
It looks like this.
Do not lose it.
Keep it moving.
We have an inbound vehicle coming in from the northern perimeter.
Do you have clearance ID? Over.
We have no ID.
We have gunfire!
It's a civilian vehicle!
- Behind you!
- Right there! Right there!
Keep moving.
Kevin, where's Linda?
- They took her. Judy?
- They took her, too.
They took George and Francine and Winton Simon and a whole mess of other people.
- Jake! Jake! Jake!
- Mom!
Let's go, people.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
I'm going back.
They got the whole town sealed off.
Roadblocks on every highway.
Tim Mitchell tried to run one.
They shot him dead.
His entire family.
Keep it moving.
Come up ahead.
David, this here might be your only chance.
Don't lose it running off on some fool's errand.
Judy's a fool's errand?
You know what I'm saying.
I'll tell you what, Kev.
Don't ask me why I can't leave without my wife.
I won't ask you why you can.
We got a breach in the yard!
Got a breach in the yard!
Move out! Move out!
Let's go! Evacuate!
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!
The crazies have breached the containment area!
- The military's pulling out!
- We gotta get outta here!
Come on! Go!
Get on board!
- We're outta here!
- Move! Move! Move!
Take 'em out!
On board! On board!
Nice to see you, too, Chief.
Oh, shit.
How'd you get out?
Tom Ellis ran his pickup through the fence.
Fucking military started shooting.
Townsfolk going nuts.
Before you know it, people are just running off into the fields.
David, Judy was still inside.
- I'm sorry.
- She's not sick.
She's been running a fever all month.
Russ, she's pregnant.
It's about time.
I'm gonna go get her.
Hoo-fucking-yah.
Let's go to the high school.
Becca? Becca!
Is that you?
Oh, God. Honey-
Honey, are you hurt?
Is this really happening?
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna be okay.
You don't really believe that, do you?
Shh.
Oh. Shh. Shh.
Please, Principal Sandborn, please stop.
Please, let me go.
Please don't do this.
No. Please don't do this.

What are you doing? Stop!
No. Please. Please.
- No! N-
- Just get out of here, please.
Stop. Please go. Don't.
- Don't hurt her. Please, just go away.
- Please.
Please.
Please stop. Please stop.
Stop. Leave her alone.
Stop.
Please just get out of here. Please.
No.
No!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, God! Oh, David!
David! Oh, God!
Are you okay?
No, not really.
- Uh, Chief?
- We gotta get to Quik Phil's truck stop on 35.
They're putting people on buses, and they're getting them out of here.
We're gonna go. Come on.
- Did Peter call?
- Shh.
- Did Peter call?
- That's gonna be me.
Russell, we've got enough problems without you inventing them.
- That's easy for you to say.
- Did Peter call?
You're at the end of the pot mine.
I'm a half mile from the farm.
- Who's the sheriff?
- What?
Who's the sheriff of Pierce County?
- You are.
- I am. Who's the deputy?
- That would be me.
- You are.
Deputy does what the sheriff tells him.
That's the balance of power.
And I'm telling you, you're not getting sick, you understand me?
Did Peter call?
Did Peter call?
I hope you're right, Chief.
I'm not world leader, but I had plans.
Did Peter call?
Come on.
Let's go.
I'll check the truck.
Fuck.
Aw, shit!
It's booted.
- They all are.
- I'll check those cars.
It's not booted.
Whoa, whoa.
Russell, get out of the truck.
Just give me a second.
Oh, Jesus.
Go. Run. Go on.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Get down, get down, get down.
Come on, boys.
Come on! Get him!
Come on! Yeah!
Whoo!
Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!
- Run, little man!
Run!
- Get him!
- Whoo!
- Nice shot. Nice shot.
- Oh, yeah!
Huh? Nice shot.
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Nice shot, huh?
Whoo!
Come on. Get him.
Hey, straight through the heart!
- Uh-huh!
- Yeah!
Shit.
- Come on.
- Huh?
Hey, he's gonna dress up real nice.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Get him up on there.
Good shot, man.
I knew I was okay about that shot.
It's a hell of a walk to Quik Phil's.
I got the old cruiser on blocks.
That piece of shit still works?
Yeah.
I guess you can't boot a car without wheels.
It's seven miles to my place.
It's five if we cut through the McGregor farm.
Another 20 to Quik Phil's from there.
- I'm fine.
- Good.
Let's go.
They took my blood.
Ran at least one test that I saw.
What if the reason they didn't let me go is because I have it?
You're pregnant.
That's why you have a fever.
David, you can't know that for sure.
I can, and I do.
If you're sick, I'm sick.
We drank from the same tap.
And I'm not sick.
None of us are.
We are gonna get through this.
What the fuck?
Scotty McGregor.
It's her boyfriend.
Russell, stop her.
- Yeah, I got it.
- David-
We don't have time for this.
You had time for me.
Okay, let's go.
It looks deserted.
Scotty?
- Scotty?
- Get back!
- Drop the fucking gun, Scotty.
- I will blow your head off.
- Scotty, it's me.
- Stay here.
Scotty, don't be an asshole.
We're fine.
Scotty.
Scotty, put the gun down.
Put it down.
Scotty.
Sorry.
Had to be sure.
Yeah, well, that's a two-way street there, Scotty.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Scotty, where's your mom?
- Back at the house.
We were just getting some supplies before we started walking.
The sheriff's got a car.
You two can come with us.
- Are you okay?
- Better than you guys.
- How's your mom?
- Be quiet.
- Get in the barn.
- Go, go, go, go, go.
Russ.
- We have one civilian coming out.
- What are you doing?
- Ma'am, please.
- Stop! Stop!
We need you downstairs.
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Wait.
- We just need to process you.
- Oh, no.
- Please!
- Okay, I got an adult male.
I just need you...
It'll just take a second, ma'am.
Too late.
Hold it right there!
Scotty!
Okay, light them up.
Okay, let's go! Split it up!
I want a complete sweep of the area!
Take my gun.
Close the back of the barn.
Move, move, move!
Don't kill me, please.
Don't kill me.
Oh, fuck.
How could you do it?
How could you...
- Becca-
- You make a sound louder than this, and I'll kill you, you understand?
- What the hell was that?
- Orders, sir.
- Who, asshole?
- Whoever gives them- I don't know.
- Bullshit!
- What the fuck is going on here?
All's they said is that there'd been some sort of accident.
My whole unit got flown in.
We didn't even know what state we was in till we seen the license plates.
Am I gonna die without my mask on?
Is that what they told you-
If you took your mask off, you were gonna die?
They just said to keep it on.
Look, um,
I know I don't deserve any favors from you people, but if you let me go,
I swear to God I won't say nothing.
I didn't sign up to shoot unarmed civilians.
- I'll just leave, okay?
- Sit down.
- Put the gun down, Russ.
- Chief...
I'm a sheriff.
That's my deputy.
Look, my wife's a doctor.
She's pregnant.
- Becca here is not even 18.
- When he blabs, they'll find us.
If we don't let him go, they'll find us for sure.
And besides, he's not gonna blab.
No, sir.
You gotta give it to him, Russ.
Shit.
I'm sorry about your folks' town.
- Hey, one up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Any crazies back there, Babcock?
Babcock?
No. We're all clear.
Good. Military's pulling back to the perimeter.
Let's go. Come on.
Barn's clear!
- We're secure back there!
- All right, then.
Mount up!
We're moving out!
If what that soldier said is true, this disease has gone airborne.
We just have to keep going.
Uh, we'll go and get the car up and running.
- Come on.
- Go.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's perfect.
It's a perfect, beautiful morning, and this is our home.
This is where we were gonna raise our baby.
We can still do all those things.
Hmm?
Everyone we know... is dead.
This town is dead, and it's not coming back.
It's never coming back.
Fuck, yeah.
See if you can find a toolbox.
Okay.
This was gonna be your room.
Judy.
Look, I know this is hard, but we've gotta keep moving.
This is the gun that killed your father.
Baby.
Peggy- Peggy, no. Not Judy.
No. No, no, no.
I shot him.
I did. I shot him.
Yes.
Peggy, I shot him.
Look at me, you crazy bitch!
That's it.
I fucking shot him!
I did it!
He walked on that field with a loaded shotgun!
And I'm glad I did!
They should give me a fucking medal!
I finally killed the town drunk!
Oh!
- Oh, God.
- We're okay.
- Baby!
- Oh, my God.
Let me see your hand.
Give me the Betadine.
Yep, that's it. Here.
Shit.
Russell. Russell!
Just making sure.
He's sick, David.
You don't know that.
- You saw what he did.
- Hey, guys.
Come on. We gotta go.
He saved our lives.
That's what I saw.
Hey, you feeling okay?
- She's fine.
- Well, I'm just saying, if she's getting sick,
- we don't wanna be in the fucking car with her.
- Russell, she's fine.
I'm not sick.
You wouldn't know,
'cause that'd be the sickness
- messing with your mind.
- Okay. Russell, that's enough.
Don't lose your head.
What do you mean by that?
I mean, don't lose your head.
What do you mean by that, Chief?
I mean...
She's fine.
Now, just...
Fuck!
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
- David, honey...
- Aw, shit.
Guys, it's turning around.
- It's coming back for us!
- Shit! Let's go!
We gotta get out of here!
- Go! Chief, let's go!
- The helicopter's coming!
- We can't stay on the highway.
- No.
There's gotta be another road we can take.
- What road? Tell me?
- I don't know. There's gotta be something.
- What road can they not see? Tell me.
- What?
What road can they not see?
What magic road can they not see?
Tell me, and I'll fucking go.
David, I'm just trying to help.
I'm sorry.
- I saw someone.
- Move. Where?
He was back there.
I know I saw someone.
Uh...
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit.
What the fuck?
David, get us outta here.
Oh, shit.
Start the car.
Come on, Chief.
Let's go. Come on.
Get us outta here.
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
- Let's go!
- All right!
Come on!
Come on! Let's go!
- Why aren't we moving?
- Why the fuck aren't we moving, Chief?
- 'Cause I can't get any fucking traction.
- Go! Go!
Fuck! Let's go!
Get us outta here! Come on!
I don't wanna die like this!
What the fuck was that?
- There! There! Right there!
- Motherfucker!
- Russell- Russ-
- There!
Oh, shit!
Motherfucker!
Russell!
- Oh, fuck!
- Russell!
I saw movement!
Everything is fucking moving!
Go! Come on! Come on!
- Stop the fucking car!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop the car!
- Stop!
- Judy!
Shit! David!
Help me here!
Help me!
Oh, God, please.
You're okay.
Becca! Becca! Becca!
Oh, no.
Becca.
No.
Becca.
That's my truck.
Fuckers spiked my tires.
Shit.
God damn it!
We need water.
I know.
Guys, car coming!
Stay here.
David, what are you doing?
We're taking this car.
- Motherfucker!
- Russ!
What are you- No!
Whoo!
Welcome to Pierce County, friendliest place on earth, asshole.
Russ, I wanna talk to him.
Okay.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm the guy standing between you and a bullet.
Now, what was on that plane?
What was on that goddamn plane?
Trixie.
Rhabdoveridae prototype.
A- A fucking biological weapon.
- It was headed
- to an incinerator in Texas.
- Whoa. What is this?
You're telling me that you guys engineered this crap?
It's designed to destabilize a population.
In this case, the wrong one.
Look, fella, we lost a plane.
What do you want me to say?
How about, "Sorry for destroying your whole goddamn town"?
- What would you have preferred, a global pandemic?
- Wait. Wait.
Take it up with the pilot.
I came here to help.
Help who? Help us?
What- What is the incubation period?
48 hours.
After that, you're either dead or you don't have it.
Fine. It's day three, and we're still talking.
So you are gonna help us.
What the fuck!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, my God!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
I said that I wanted to talk to him!
You talked.
Shit.
I'm gonna need that back.
I'll carry it for a while.
- You've been carrying it the whole time.
- Oh, no. Really.
I got it.
You sure?
Yeah.
Russell, we're on your side.
My side? Shit.
I didn't even know there were sides.
- There's not. I'm just-
- Shut up the fuck up!
- Tell her to shut up, or I'll kill her, too.
- Russell, no!
- Judy, stop talking.
- Okay.
Let him think about what he's doing.
Uh-huh.
One, two, three.
That's how many times
I've saved your life.
Go on.
Walk out where I can see you.
Move!
Fucking heavy.
Move!
- Fuck it. I'm gonna confront him.
- No, David. Don't. Please.
If we don't make it to that truck stop, we're dead anyway.
- Don't, David. Don't.
- Back off!
- I wanna talk to you.
- I will fucking shoot you where you stand.
- I just wanna talk.
- David, stop.
You better listen to me.
- David.
- Put the gun down.
- Final warning, Chief.
- Put it down.
Please? Just put it down.
I just wanna talk.
You and me, man to man.
Come on.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Here's the deal.
Fuck!
Hey.
You remember that monster catfish
I caught last summer?
What'd he weigh, you reckon?
35, 40 pounds.
Shit.
It was a big son of a bitch.
I'm not right, am I?
Can I walk with you guys?
Just a little while longer?
Please?
Shit.
If you cut through there, you can make it to the highway on the other side.
- They'll see us.
- Nah, they'll be focusing on me.
Deputy does what the sheriff tells him, right?
You're the sheriff.
Come on, Chief.
I'm done.
I'm gonna die here no matter what.
So let it mean something.
Let it mean that you two made it.
Give me that.
Hoo-fucking-yah.
We got an inbound!
- Hey!
- Attention!
- You have entered a military operation.
- Hey! Hey!
Please identify yourself.
My name's Deputy Russell Crank, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department.
- Keep your hands in the air and walk slowly.
- It's okay. I'm not sick.
Make no sudden movements
- or you will be fired upon.
- Oh, shit.
We are a live-fire operation.
Get out from behind the vehicle.
You are in breach of a Level 4 military operation.
Reveal yourself, or we will open fire.
- Proceed slowly with your hands in the air.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Now stop there and get down on the ground.
Stop and get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground now!
- He's down!
- Man down! Cease fire!
Fireteam Bravo, move up.
Alpha Team, stand by!
Let's go, let's go!
Approach with caution.
Movement in tight.
He's still breathing!
Secure that weapon!
Stay on him.
Fuck you for what you did.
Hey! Get an 18-Wheeler Dog only at Quik Phil's.
Football fans, show your support this off-season with our University of Iowa
Hawkeyes Snack Pack.
One jar of hot sauce and one jar of salsa in a collectible Iowa Hawkeyes helmet.
Available while supplies last only at Quik Phil's.
It was Grand Central last night.
Nothing satisfies hunger better than a Quik Phil's Mega-burger.
Take it to go or eat it here
- in one of our panoramic dining areas.
- Wait here.
Hello?
Judy?
Judy! Judy!
Judy, you all right?
Ohh.
They exterminated everyone, not just the sick.
- Look, there's a rig we can take.
- What's the point?
- If we get out of here, they're gonna kill us, too.
- No.
- If we get to Cedar Rapids-
- David, can you just stop it?
- If we get to Cedar Rapids-
- Can you stop pretending everything is gonna be okay?
All right.
For Christ sakes.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You wanna give up?
You wanna sit here and die?
Tell me, and I will sit here and die with you.
You gonna go get that truck?
Blackbird 2, this is T.O.C.
We are approaching T minus ten minutes.
Confirm status.
This is Blackbird 2...
All units, this is T.O.C.
Be advised we are at ready status.
Proceed to countdown.
Countdown procedure initiated.
We are at T minus ten minutes.
All right. Blackbird 2 is in the air-
Truck!
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Honey, it's fine.
It's okay.
Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck.
David, honey, how's it going there?
We're gonna get there.
Oh, shit. Baby, come on.
Come on. Come on.
David.
God damn it!
David, come on.
- Hurry up.
- God damn it.
I'm sorry. It's okay.
They've gotta be in here somewhere,
David. Come on.
- Just keep looking.
- Oh, fuck me. Just-
Jesus, David.
What are you doing?
Come on, baby. Come on.
David!
David! Quick! Come on!
David!
Let's get the fuck out of here, huh?
The smallest, straightest road to Cedar Rapids.
Yeah. Perfect.

Burbank, CA
We want to update you on late-breaking news.
A massive fire in Ogden Marsh continues to rage, and high winds are preventing fire teams from containing the deadly blaze.
Now, information is still coming in, but what we currently know:
An explosion rocked the Dakon Petrol chemical plant early this morning, with eyewitness reports of a 400-foot fireball that lit up the sky.
We also have reports of a second explosion at a nearby truck fueling station.
A perimeter has been set in an effort to contain the blaze, and civilians are not being permitted into that area.
Help me.
Let me out.
Let me.. let me out.
Let me out!
Open the door!
Ah!
H1N1 trial 0697.
Approximate time of death:
0200 hours.
From initial exposure until full onset of symptoms, confirm...
22 days, six.plus hours.
Still too slow.
You have to be reasonable,
Mrs. Herring.
This strain's the most efficient one yet.
23 days is a lifetime,
Doctor.
What I need is panic.. instant panic.
Anything the matter?
If it's a question of funding,
I'm sure others would find my compensation more than fair.
. We'll need another trial subject.
. Done.
We need to expand the lab team.. more hands.
Whatever you need will be provided.
Make me a plague,
Doctor.
Malcolm S. Burr?
Age 29;
BS Biological Science,
Hopkins 2003; dual degree..
MD.PhD 2007, specializing in cytological abnormality and pathology.
Could say I spent enough time in school to earn my tenure.
Um, of course, that's not to say I don't have plenty of field experience.
If you read on, you'll notice my lab work in Mendoza, Argentina.
I was part of a social program treating the infectious agents in the livestock.
Our team was actually one of the first to identify the native H1N1 strain on the molecular..
Do you know what we do here, Dr. Burr?
As far as I'm aware, sir, you're synthesizing an H1N1 vaccine.
. You're the good guys.
. We're hired hands.
We do what we're told, what we're paid to do.
Well, what you're doing here is very noble, Doctor.
I've been on this project now for almost a year.
This is grim, ugly medicine.. nothing noble about it.
With this record, you could go anywhere.
The industry is starving for young cell doctors like yourself.
With all due respect,
Dr. Gravamen,
I've seen this disease at its worst.
And maybe I could have gone somewhere else or done something else, but.. but I need to be here, Dr. Gravamen.
Late night for a... big bad wolf to be out all alone.
Looking for a little love, Wolfie?
You know, Daddy says
I shouldn't talk to strangers.
Then again,
I got a lot of daddies.
Hello?
You shy or what?
Where am I?
Who are you?
Please.
My mother will wonder where I am, please.
. Oh. Good morning.
. Morning.
Sorry, you startled me.
I'm usually the first one here, even before the doctor.
Well, I thought
I'd get a head start.
. I couldn't sleep anyway.
. First day?
Am I that obvious?
Um, just a little polished.
Meaning?
Well, the suit.
I mean, unless you intend on reading a eulogy later, you might want to tone it down a little bit.
Been around here since the beginning, when Mrs. Herring first commissioned the project after the outbreak.
I found it comforting to know that benefactors were taking an interest in public health, not just for profit but for the greater good.
How's the progress been going?
Slow.moving but steady.
You know, H1N1 takes so many forms that it's hard to predict what's next
. to form appropriate vaccines.
. Yeah.
But we try.
You know, we all try.
And Dr. Gravamen is a great man, you know?
So I've heard.
It's like what do we got to do to be appreciated?
As much time as I spend in this lab looking at microbes, you'd think by now I'd have antenna growing out of my fucking ears.
Kenny, give it a rest.
No one wants to hear your whining in the morning.
Ha. What do you got to show for it, sunshine?
Getting up every day at 5:00 AM.
'Cause all I got is a savings account that's dwindling almost as fast as this chair rash that's growing on my ass.
Ugh!
No one wants to hear that.
Do you?
'Cause I don't.
Oh, the biotech money to be made in the private sector.
I hear you, pal. I could finally get that
Audi coupe I've been looking at.
You the new guy, the MD?
Appears so.
Um, Malcolm Burr.
. Kenny Welchman.
. Pleasure.
Never mind Francis.
He's just upset that his parents named him Francis.
I see you met our little tech Abby.
And, um, that's Cori.
Try not to listen to her.
She's a product of public school.
. Morning, staff.
. Good morning, Doctor.
. Doctor.
. Nice to see you awake.
Dr. Burr, once you've changed, if you'd be so kind.
Of course.
As you know, after its initial outbreak in South America, the native H1N1 virus has been largely contained.
Minus a body count well over 1,000.
Fair enough.
But rather than using native H1N1, we focus our research on viral variants.
Human adapted strains.
. You're mutating the virus yourselves?
. Precisely.
To provide vaccine before a more deadly strain emerges.
But predicting the random mutation of a hostile virus..
There's only a limited number of ways the virus can adapt to recognize human receptors.
We presuppose those mutations. ln synthesizing these variants in a controlled environment, we generate vaccine stocks against possible viral mutation.
Contrary to what you may believe, the most vicious H1N1 outbreak has yet to occur.
And when it does... we'll have the solution.
Hey!
Anybody there?
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
Anybody?
Look, I'm sorry for whatever I did.
Just.. just let me out.
Hello!
Trial 0698: female subject, approximately 1 25 lbs, sexually active.
Barring psychological profile, remains in good health.
Treatment yet to be decided.
My God.
This morning I was stocking the database, observing recently manipulated mutant samples.
I came across an H1N1 version X fresh off the gene.therapy assembly line.
And?
And? Well... let's just say that in all my time in South America,
I never saw anything move this fast.
I mean, that virus was deadly, but this.. this..
It swallowed an entire host of T.cells right before my eyes in real time.
A strain resistant to even the most potent antivirals.
. Version X?
. It got me thinking: what if.. what if in our effort to predetermine
H1N1's mutant variants, we create a strain that we can't control?
We've been over this.
Your job here is to enact our methods,
. not question them.
. Yes yes!
. But what if..
. What if what?
We have strict security measures.. a lockdown if necessary.
I'm just saying maybe we should look over those security measures.
. Double.check the inventories..
. Burr!
Your concerns have been noted, but already taken into account.
Of course, sir.
I don't know what
I was thinking.
Don't get any ideas,
Doctor.
A conscience is one thing a scientist cannot afford.
Jerron?
Yes, Doctor?
I think we've found what we've been looking for.
Yes, Doctor.
Who's that?
Just someone
I used to know.
During your work abroad?
Yeah.
She was one of the first to get it bad.
When we admitted her, we didn't.. we had no idea what was wrong.
We thought it was the common flu.
One day she was walking around with a baby girl... the next she was flat on her back.
Even through residency, I.. it was the first time
I'd ever seen anyone die.
I'm sorry.
It's.. the photo's just a reminder, you know, of who we're trying to help.
What's at stake.
Yeah. Come on.
Let's get some food, huh?
Trial 0698, continuous.
Administered sample: version X, virus H1N1.
Hello?
What's going on?
Who are you?
What are you.. what are you doing?
Stop!
No don't!
No no!
Please don't hurt me.
No! No!
No, please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt.. ah!
Trial 0698.
Administered sample: version X, virus H1N1.
Treatment successful.
Approximate time of first contact and infection:
1900 hours.
Based on the observed virus spread, estimated life expectancy: three days.
Get her off me!
No no no.
No no no!
Don't!
Jerron, subdue the patient at all costs.
Do you hear me?
At all costs.
Jerron, that duct leads into the main lab.
She's entering the lab.
. See, look. Look.
. God, you're foul.
Do you know how many germs you just put back in there?
. That's disgusting.
. Go on, finish your story.
She's in the lab.
I'm taking somebody home tonight even if I have to use a U.Haul.
You know what I mean?
Like she's gotta..
It's not funny.
It's wrong.
You gotta eat what's on your plate.
I'm not gonna starve or go home by myself.
What the fuck?
You gotta help me.
You gotta help me!
. He's coming.
. Hey. Hey, calm down.
. What's wrong?
. He's coming.
. Who's coming? What's wrong?
. He's coming!
. Who's..
. You have to hide me.
. Please hide me.
. Hide you from who?
. Calm down. Who's coming?
. Please hide me.
Subject has just entered the staff lounge.
. You have to hide me, please.
. Hide you from who?
. Tell us what is going on.
. What's wrong?
. Please!
. Who's coming?
Ah! Stay the fuck away from me!
. Stay away from me.
. Who the hell are you?
Stay the fuck away!
Please help me!
. Fuck me.
. Oh God.
Oh shit.
What have you done?
What have you done?
Malcolm, don't.
. Oh my God.
. Oh shit.
Jerron, leave them and come back here at once.
At once!
Yes, Doctor.
Doctor?
Oh my fucking God.
I don't understand.
Herring residence.
Gravamen for Mrs. Herring.
Yes.
One moment, Doctor.
What is it?
Mrs. Herring, there's been an accident.
She's infected.
Oh shit.
Listen, Doctor, if you can't contain your patient that's your own fault.
These consequences are on you.
I assume full responsibility.
Now we've already lost one trial subject, but there is a silver lining.
We've gained your staff.
If the sample is as strong as you suggest, we'll soon be rid of the problem anyway.
Accidents do happen.
You know what you must do.
It'll be taken care of.
I grow tired of shortcomings, Doctor.
Now please, I must get back to my guests.
God forgive me.
What the hell's that?
What the hell is that?
What's going on?
. They're shutting us in.
. The lab's locking down.
We gotta get out of here!
. We can't just leave her.
. Then you fucking stay.
. Come on, come on!
. Abby, come on!
Please, Abby.
Please.
We're in here!
We're in here!
Come on!
Which way, Abby?
Abby, where's the exit?
Malcolm, we've.. we've tested the lockdown.
Fuck!
We're in here!
You gotta let us out.
It's secure, Malcolm.
There's no way out.
No.
Trial continuous.. administered sample: version X, virus H1N1.
Estimated life expectancy: three days.
. It's too tight.
. Okay.
. Yeah.
. There. Okay.
Guys, I don't feel right.
I mean, I'm really cold but I can't stop sweating.
Kenny, will you pass her the blanket?
Yeah.
. Ready?
. Mm.hmm.
Doctor?
Doctor, are you there?
Can you hear me?
It's Vox.
Doctor,
I know you're there.
Get rid of him.
Respond.
Jerron.
Jerron, I need to speak to Dr. Gravamen.
I'm sorry, Dr. Vox.
The good doctor is indisposed at the moment.
All right then.
Whatever the hell that means.
Look, I need you to get me out of here.
Just open the lab doors long enough for me to sneak out.
Whatever the hell you guys have planned,
I don't need to be a part of it.
Just as long as
I'm taken care of.
Regretfully,
Mrs. Herring has no plans of opening the lockdown.
Plans?
Fuck her plans!
You tell Mrs. Herring that I'm in here.
She'll listen to you.
Tell her whatever she paid me,
I'll give it back.
You just tell her.
Mrs. Herring is extremely appreciative of your sacrifice,
Dr. Vox.
My sacrifice?
You listen, you cold.blooded asshole.
This is your fault, not mine!
I'm an asset.
I'm dependable.
I am the eyes and ears in here looking out for that bitch's affairs, not you!
You're just the hired guns coming in blazing.
Now you get those doors open.
I apologize, Dr. Vox, but this transmission is over.
Jerron?
Jerron!
Jerron?
Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck.
Jerron!
Okay, you're done.
You're next.
No way, Burr.
Nobody's pricking me with anything.
I feel fine.
Fuckin' aces.
How's it look?
. Anything?
. Nada.
Not a damn thing.
Wireless is dead too.
CPUs just keep roving and roving.
The shutdown scrambled the system.
All the outside lines are dead.
It is so cold in here.
Jesus.
Give me good news, Burr.
Tell me these shakes I got are just my nerves.
Sorry.
What's the damage?
After analyzing our blood samples,
I have to conclude that we've all been infected with a particularly aggressive viral mutation.
The same strain of H1N1
I observed the other day.
Oh shit.
How nasty is it?
It's fast, both airborne and blood.borne.
Though minus the sample from Francis, it's already in our blood.. all of us, mutating.
Christ Almighty.
How long do we have?
I can't be sure.
But according to my observational report, a healthy human host has approximately... three days.
Five at most.
We're fucked.
We're all fucked.
No. No we're not.
We're not.
I mean, come on. There's got to be something that we can do.
I mean, we've been working on these vaccines for all of these strands from the very beginning.
Right? Right?
We have speculative antivirals.
We have high.dose inhaler cocktails that can stop the on.spread.
Um, we empty out the fridges.
We use everything we have to formulate a proper vaccine.
I just wish we could get in touch with the doctor. I wish there was some way..
What the hell is wrong with you all?
Dr. Gravamen would know what to do.
He always knew what to do.
Open your eyes!
Those doors are closed.
Nobody is coming for us.
Not Gravamen, not anyone!
We're in here alone.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
The girl.
What about her?
She must have come out of some rabbit hole, right?
Start pumping the antivirals.
Test any vaccine we've got.
I'm gonna crawl through and see what I can find.
No no,
I don't like this.
There've already been too many surprises.
I think we should stick together.
We shouldn't separate.
I'll go with you.
Ladies first.
Please, after you.
They'll tell them everything, Doctor.
Doesn't matter.
Hmm.
Cruel to let the rats run the maze when there is only dead ends.
Must be an auxiliary lab.
You ever seen it before?
No.
My God.
Malcolm, don't.
Is he alive?
Cardiac repression, uh, blood loss, shock.
Been dead about six to eight hours.
Help. Help me.
I need a fluid lV and an injection of antivirals, STAT!
Move it, people!
Move!
. What's wrong with him?
. He's infected.
We starting a club?
We're all fuckin' infected.
No idea how long he's been alone without food or water in isolation.
Where's that shot, Abby?
. Where's that shot?
. Coming up.
. Hold him!
. Shit! Shit!
Oh my God!
The vaccine.. vaccine.
The vaccine?
Find the doctor..
Gravamen.
Gravamen!
. Jesus Christ.
. It can't be.
No.
No no no!
Help me stabilize him!
. Shit!
. Help me stabilize him!
Hold him down!
Oh God.
You got another one of those?
Countless.. countless hours of research.
And all thinking that we're working for some better good.
If Gravamen has had a vaccine, what have we been doing here this whole time?
You can't believe what that guy said.
It could have been brain aneurysms or shock.
It must be nice living in the dark, Abby.
Face it, Gravamen's out there just counting the time.
Waiting for us to rot.
We have more control than you may think.
The virus isn't in the streets.
It's not in the cities or the countryside.
It's in here.. it's in you; it's in me; it's in all of us.
. Spit it out, Burr.
. The virus is a weapon.
Like nothing
I've ever seen.
And personally, I'm not ready to lie down and allow a worldwide pandemic.
We burn this place from the inside.
. What?
. Shit, Burr.
Burn down the lab?
You're losing your fucking mind.
There's more than enough combustibles here to do it.
It is absolutely feasible.
Oh yeah!
It's fuckin' genius.
Why don't we all just kill ourselves?
With none of the antivirals taking effect, we're already living on borrowed time.
We do this now.. make it right.
No. If Gravamen's got a vaccine, maybe there's a chance.
All we have to do..
Don't you understand?
It doesn't matter what Gravamen has!
He's out there and we're in here.
He's out there and we're in here.
What?
. He's out there...
. What? What is it?
...and we're in here.
He's out there and we're in here.
Yeah, I heard you.
I knew it was just a matter of time before we all went a little batshit crazy.
The lockdown happened immediately without any relay.
Where was Gravamen?
How did he know?
. What are you saying?
. He's watching us.
Here.
An eye in the sky.
No, can't be.
He put cameras in the wall?
Sick motherfucker!
You see me Gravamen?!
You see this?
You sick motherfucker.
Francis!
Francis! Francis.
. Get off me!
. It's all right.
Get off me!
Get off me!
Blow it out your ass, fucking Welchman!
Get off me!
As for the rest of you, do whatever you want.
You can suck Malcolm's shoes for all I care.
Just count me out.
Fuckin' idiots.
They want to give up and set themselves on fire. ldiots!
Doctor?
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
I picture you watching me, but it just doesn't make sense.
You were always so kind.
A kindness you can see in the eyes.
It's my sister's birthday this week.
She's turning 18.
She's supposed to come visit me, maybe look at campuses.
I haven't even thought about her.
I talk about you with my family, you know?
All the work we're doing.
They keep asking me to move home.
I tell them, ''No no.''
''The doctor needs me.
I'm making a difference.''
Abby?
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I usually don't do this.
It's just..
I just thought he was a good man.
I just feel so stupid.
You didn't do anything wrong, Abby.
I trusted him.
We all did.
He fooled every one of us.
Right now we have to do what's right.
Malcolm.
I don't want to die.
What is it... about a person's mechanics that makes them so desperate when cornered?
So dramatically unpredictable?
That's what pleases me about you...
Doctor.
You.. you are reliable.
I believe I admire that.
Little help.
We don't need no water.
Let the motherfucker burn.
This should be enough fireworks.
This is flammable.
Kenny, what are we doing?
Look at this.
You tell me we're doing the right thing, Kenny.
The right thing?
I don't know what the right thing is.
This is something.
Gravamen's watching us, right?
So he's not going to let us burn this place down.. all the work we've done.
He's gonna see this, he's gonna open the doors and we're gonna be out of here, okay?
I'm getting out of here.
You're coming with me.
Yeah.
I don't want to be here.
Kenny, I want to go home.
I don't want to go out like this.
This is insane.
You look like shit.
Stupid.
It'll be okay.
Gravamen!
Gravamen!
Gravamen!
I should have known you were watching us.
Are you paranoid?
You should be, you stupid bastard.
All the nooks and crannies in this bunker.. they're perfect for your secrets.
Secrets I helped you hide!
I see you.
You know I never liked you.
Something about those beady little eyes.
And I knew..
I knew that this was gonna be bad.
What are you doing,
Doctor?
And those fucking idealists in there..
Malcolm, fucking Abby.
They don't account for scumbags like you and me.
But you got me.
You got me!
That says something.
Now I'm talking to ghosts.
Gravamen!
Fascinating.
Gravamen!
Cori?
Gravamen!
It's too late!
Gravamen!
Oh my God.
Cori.
Listen, hang on.
No.
I'm sorry, man.
Stay with me, Francis!
No, baby.
Please, no.
Oh God, Francis.
Hold on, Francis.
Come on, Francis.
It's faster, Abby.
It's faster than
I thought.
Oh God.
Oh no.
Doctor?
Yes?
Madame?
Ah, good morning, Jerron, my most loyal compatriot.
How's my little experiment coming along?
Progressing very well,
Madame.
There have been five casualties already.
Five?
So fast.
Gravamen and his worker bees have outdone themselves.
By the look of the others, we may expect a complete body count in the coming days.
Ah.
Excellent, Jerron.
That's excellent news on an excellent morning.
But there has been a complication. lsn't there always?
The karma of good news and its backlash.
It appears the good doctor has surprised me, deviating from his typical behavioral pattern.
Gravamen.
What headache has he cooked up for me now?
He has taken it upon himself to override the lockdown, Madame.
He what?
He is in the lab.
Jerron, listen very carefully.
With a virus strain this fast and effective, the work is done.
Gravamen and any others are immediately expendable.
I give you full warrant to dispatch of them any way possible.
Don't let anyone out of that lab, Jerron.
You understand?
Of course, Madame.
Kenny.
No.
You son of a bitch, you let them die!
Same as pulling a trigger or dragging a knife across our throats.
. She had a plan, Malcolm.
. Who had a plan?
Danita Herring, my benefactor.
You think I wanted this?
. I'm just a doctor.
. Bullshit.
. What about the girl?
. Just a trial subject.
Trial subject?
A guinea pig.
I'm just doing what I was told, what I was paid to do.
I hope you were paid well.
You pig.
Years ago, after H1N1 first hit,
I developed an angel antidote.. an inhibitor that not only stopped the production of the virus, but also caused it to literally destroy itself.
But the epidemic had slowed, so she commissioned me to mutate the virus into something uncontrollable.. fast, a horror.
A horror you were going to unleash on the public!
Danita wanted the world desperate.
She wanted them terrified, frenzied.
She would be hailed as a savior.
She would be a hero.
She'd make millions.
Billions, Malcolm, billions.
So that's what we've been doing.
That's what we've been doing this entire time.
We're nothing but pawns for a rich woman's sick scheme.
I'm sorry, Abby.
I'm so sorry.
Don't you dare.
You used us.
I found myself doing things.
I heard myself saying things.
I'm weak.
I couldn't watch you,
Abby, suffering.
The antidote, where is it?
She keeps it in a medical facility not more than
10 miles from here.
So we still have time.
We release the antidote before Herring has a chance to unleash it on the world.
How can we trust what he says?
Good God in heaven.
Hey, Doc.
So nice you could join the party.
How rude of me.
It's not like we have a choice.
Ah ah ah ah.
Oh no.
Will he listen to you?
Hardly.
He's Herring's wind.up toy.
Tsk tsk, Doctor.
You disappointed your employer.
Step aside, Jerron.
Herring's already got what she needs.
The virus is already as strong and deadly as it will ever be.
Where are you running off to then?
Making trouble?
There's no need for anyone else to die, Jerron.
On the contrary, Doctor.
You are as expendable as all the others.
I'm not afraid of you, Jerron.
I know what you are.
Do you?
I wonder at times when I watch you what makes you act.
What it feels like to hurt.
To know death is close.
Rattling.
So delicate, so fragile, your bodies... your sex... quivering, rotting.
Don't touch her!
Malcolm. ln a way,
I believe I envy you.
You sense your end, your mortality.
At this moment you were never more alive on the eve of death.
You're not.. you're not human.
Sadly.
Pity, isn't it, Doctor? ln death, they're not so colorful.
Just do it.
Do it already.
Ahh!
I believe I envy you.
So vulnerable.
So fragile.
At this moment... you are in the moment.
You were never more alive.
You sense your end, your mortality.
Mortality.
I see it when I watch you.
What it feels like to hurt.
To know death is close.
Rattling.
Danita Herring.
How'd you get in here?
We found your little stash,
Mrs. Herring.
Who are you?
Gravamen's vaccine works wonders. ln the right hands, it's worth a fortune.
Do I know you?
No.
No, you don't.
But we know you.
Where am I?
Let me out of here.
I demand you let me out of here at once.
What do you want?
I'll give you anything.
No.
No.
You can't do this to me!
Please.
Please please.
Please please.
Please.
You can't.
There was once upon a time a town, not far from a big city.
A road ran through, but there were only a few businesses.
A coffee shop, a hardware store, a sheriff's office.
And all kinds of people..
Vagrants, runaway teens...
Religious fanatics, retired seniors who...
Well, it was a town of those who want to be left alone...
And so they were.
Sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, had been there for years...
Also made wood novelties.
But the most astonishing thing about the town was...
An old belfry, that had a clock tower with seven faces.
You could see the time from anywhere in the town of Swann valley.
The faces persistently told different times.
No question, something evil was abiding there.
Perhaps it was because of the terrible murder that happened years before.
Too terrible to talk about. But which haunted the town.
Or perhaps it was those teenagers who gathered across the lake.
Some people thought they did bad things.
Worshiped Satan.
The way they dressed, the music they played...
And their mysterious leader known only as flamingo.
A seducer of innocent youth...
And some said... far worse.
It was at this certain time...
That a third string writer...
Of popular fiction, hall Baltimore...
Drove into Swann valley. On his book signing tour...
Of another of his series of novels...
About witchcraft.
Excuse me, do you know where the bookstore is?
- There's no bookstore around here.
- Great.
Have you ever read a hall Baltimore thriller?
No, thanks.
Have you ever read hall Baltimore thriller?
No... who is hall Baltimore?
- I am he.
- Oh. Nice to meet you.
- And you are...
- Stacey.
- Oh excuse me, sorry.
- Hi Stacey. Bye Stacey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You sell weapons?
- Uh, no weapons, just ammunition.
- Pistols?
- Ammunition?
- Yes.
- Knives?
- Isle 2.
The hall Baltimore. I'll take one.
- Could you uh... autograph it?
- Sure.
To Bobby LaGrange.
To Bobby LaGrange. Best witches.
Hall Baltimore.
How does it feel to be the bargain basement Stephen king?
Not too wonderful.
Well, you know, I uh, I write horror stories myself.
You don't say? And you're the sheriff here in the town?
40 years.
You wouldn't uh, or would you, mind reading some of my stuff?
I'd be much obliged.
You know we had a mass murder.
A while back.
A lot of folks think the town's haunted well, I'm, I'm uh, just wrapping it up here in the town...
And then I'm gonna be on my way.
You a mystery writer and you're not interested in mass murder?
No.
You come with me right now...
And take a look at the doozie
I got in the morgue.
- You got a doozie in the morgue?
- Yes sir.
- Now?
- Yes, sir.
There's a story in it.
- I know what this must look like...
- It is like a wood...
- Ow! Jesus! Let me ask you a question.
How long have you worked here?
- Well you don't run a gurney with a dead person on over my foot!
Sorry, sheriff.
- Is this a common occurrence in Swann valley?
- It's happened before.
Serial killing it appears to be leaves a calling card as a wooden stake.
- I don't want to see her face.
- I don't blame you.
I mean, it's really a tragedy.
She's just a poor girl.
- Arbus?
- Yeah?
- Arbus!
- Alright, alright.
- You're on the clock.
- Do you know who she is?
- This girl?
We get all kind here vagrants, runaways..
Worse, those kids out at the lake.
All kinds.
How'd you like to collaborate on a book about this? You and me?
Are you gonna... leave that stake in her like that?
- Howdy. I'd like to fill my thermos full of coffee, please.
- Okay
Edgar Allan poe slept in this town?
- Sure did.
- At the old chickering hotel way back when.
- Chickering hotel... thanks.
- Have a good day.
With my respect sir.
I want to write something I do.
I want to write something for me.
Something personal.
Does that make any sense? I have to break the spell of this downward spiral.
There's only one way to do it and I'm trying to do it. I'm not gonna write another witch book.
I told them that... and, and, and that's it, I'm gonna do something for me.
You've done it before when you weren't drinking.
Before Vicky's accident.
I can't rush these things.
You can do this. I... I know what...
I know what you mean about you just have to do it one more time.
Just... write the damn thing, then you can, then you can take the time and write what you really want to write.
I understand, I get it. You know I do.
Did you call Sam? Did you tell him we need an advance?
Well I did and it was extremely humiliating.
And I'm not gonna write another witch story.
- You're having a holiday?
- No I'm...
And I'm stuck here.
- Listen to me... can you?
- Trying to put people off...
Come up with magic numbers...
To make it all work out.
Pretend there's nothing wrong and put food on the table.
Denise will you listen to me?
You can't, you can't speak to me like this... just grow up... Grow up!
People always ask me, "how do you know so much about witches?"
And I tell them,
"'cause I married one."
- Hey.
- Hello. Where do you come from?
Just down the road. You past me.
You looking at my teeth?
No I'm not, I just didn't know where you came from.
I am very self conscious about my buck teeth.
Show me.
Your teeth are fine. It's those braces.
- Anyway I hate them.
- No, they're fine. You'll grow into them.
They call me vampira, because of these teeth.
- But you can call me V.
- V. That's nice.
- What's your real name?
- Virginia.
Virginia.
You're about 13?
Yeah, I'm 12. But I look older because I'm tall.
I know who you are. You wrote those witch stories.
And you're here to sign books over at the hardware store.
I love your books.
Especially the part where Elizabeth says,
"forsake me never, for I will entice you from my grave."
That's my favorite part.
Thanks, I like your look.
Oh... yeah.
It's just the way I dress.
- You scared of me yet?
- What?
Yes.
A little.
That clock it chimed midnight three times already.
Keeping track of time around here is pointless.
That's why I missed your book signing.
Well that old hotel is open. Come on
I'll buy you a soda... sweetie
I have a girl your age.
- No, I don't think that a particularly good idea.
- Why not?
That's what I had to go to the hardware store and talk about. My story.
- Well tell it to me now.
- No, I can't.
Come on.
We're open. Come in.
I... went for walk, I guess I got lost.
- Hey what happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?
- Is the restaurant open?
- Restaurant's always open.
What with that old clock tower and all those faces, you can get breakfast anytime.
Yes.
- Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.
Damned clock.
That clock has never told the correct time.
Just you wait. You're gonna be very surprised.
Bell's the important thing, and it's working beautifully.
- Better than before.
- I'll just uh, have a beer.
Melvin is the belfry custodian, assigned to the big clock at church.
It's a hopeless job. And a real burden.
That old mechanism's on it's last legs.
I go up there about every day, or most.
Those seven faces they look at me like I was the one who invented daylight savings time.
You know who came up with daylight savings time, don't you?
Hitler. And, you know who supports it now?
Doctors. And you know why? Golf.
They want more time to golf. That's what it's all about.
You can't change time. Time changes you.
Don't you agree? What's your position on daylight savings time?
- I've never really thought about it.
- What have you been thinking about?
- That's the grave.
- Grave?
Oh you can walk on it. Don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.
- It is?
- There are twelve children buried right down there.
13 children murdered in cold blood.
Well, actually he's right.
It is an even dozen, but one got away and she was damned.
- When was that?
- Oh, a long time ago.
The clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Ha, the clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Got you, devil.
- She drew blood.
- Suck it out... suck it out, suck it out.
- Goddamn her...
- Hey
- write it down.
- What time did she bite you? 4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 o’clock.
- The clock says four o'clock.
- You've got to be kidding me?
She's the devil.
It's the dead little kids.
You?
Why are you here?
- What has she told you?
- Nothing. What should she tell me?
Go away, old man... you know what you did.
Children... hurry.
The moon is going down...
Time for nap.
Come on. Come along now, come on.
My God, I'm lost.
Maybe this is what I need, this story.
Where are you going?
Help me.
You? My God... Edgar poe.
Show me the way.
Hall, wake up.
- Are you, I know you're there.
Are you awake?
- What? It wasn't me.
It's me. This is your wife. Hello?
Hall, wake up. Are you, i know you're there.
- What's the matter?
- Are you awake? It's me.
What's the matter? Everything okay?
This is your wife. Yeah, i know who you are.
I didn't, well...
I need a second. What's, oh my God.
What have you done?
Yeah?
That?
- Do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.
160,000 dollars.
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.
You shouldn't even be touching it. How did you get into my safe? Just calm down.
Please stop, just, just, whatever you're doing, just stop and put it down.
That's really not a joke..
You think it's. I don't think it's funny.
It's a nice book though eh?
Yes, Whitman only had...
There's only four of those in private hands okay. Do you understand what that means?
- Do you... He set the type himself.
- Do you think I'm joking?
- Please.
- You know what... I think you care more this old book than you do your own family.
- You need the gloves for that.
- You know what?
Get the advance or you can kiss it good bye.
- Please.
- Don't make me have to do this.
I don't want to... I have to.
- Hello. I'm looking for...
- Mrs. LaGrange is sleeping. Quiet.
Oh, sorry.
I'd like to know if you have any information on the old chickering hotel?
I'll check the files.
Thank you
Swann valley, sheriff's office please.
One moment.
Your number is 393 229 39 23.
Do you wish to be connected?
Yes.
Sheriff's office, we're closed.
Yes, hi, it's me, you remember me, the writer.
I'm here at the window.
I'm gonna go to the front door.
Alright.
- We're closed.
- Can I talk to you?
Look sheriff says nothing happens as long as that thing is in here.
- Oh, where's the sheriff?
- It's Sunday.
He's at the church. It's a mystery, he's not very religious listen, listen, uh... what time did you say the country coroner was coming to take the stake out?
I didn't say nothing about nothing.
- Um, uh, somebody said it was this week... somebody said.
- But it wasn't me.
Can I, can I come in?
Okay but look you can't touch anything.
It's all evidence.
Don't touch anything, you got it?
It's my responsibility, and I don't want that guy yelling at me, I'm sick of it.
- Hello.
- Yeah, can I talk to the sheriff?
Just a minute.
Bobby.
Telephone.
- Yeah.
- Hey sheriff, I got that writer fella from out of town here at the office.
He doesn't know it's Sunday?
Let me talk to him.
Hey Bobby, it's hall Baltimore.
Yeah I couldn't get your story and the image of that poor dead girl out of my mind.
- Really?
- Yes, I dreamt about it all night.
I'd like to write that book with you.
So, you're the sheriff and you make bat houses?
Yes, and that's a bird house.
Totally different..
The bats and the birds know which is which.
Well normally I write about witchcraft but...
What are vampires but witches that suck blood.
Entirely different.
We haven't really had one here.
There are no witches here, since as long as I can remember.
I could ask my sister.
She's older than Hades.
Welcome to my office. Come on have a seat.
Imagine this. Written by...
Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange. Sweet.
Or, hall Baltimore with an idea by Bobby LaGrange.
What do you mean an idea by? I got a hell of a lot more than an idea by.
- I got a great character.
- Yeah, who?
- Bobby LaGrange.
- Calm` down. Tell me what you got. Shoot.
I call it, the vampire executions...
And that will sell.
Not bad. Go on.
The girl, who is she?
Is she just a runaway?
Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl...
That looks much older than she really is.
A vagrant? Homeless?
- Why the wooden stake?
- Yeah, why?
What, did that kill her?
Or was it something that was added later?
As a calling card for the real killer?
You see, one end of it was worn smooth.
No fingerprints.
And then it was pressed into her... slowly.
Not jab, not stab.
Almost as if it was done by some kind of a machine.
- A machine?
- Yeah.
That's why I call it the vampire executions.
I think she was killed by.
..An electric chair...
For vampires.
An execution device, designed especially by and for vampires.
That's different... I wonder what that would look like.
Well I thought of that. I made a model.
- Ready?
- Ready how about that?
Watch this.
You love it?
- How can I help you, Hall.
- Hey Sam...
Remember you said if I come with a bulletproof idea, you'd give me an advance?
- Another advance.
- Yeah, another, more.
A bulletproof idea comes with meat on the bone.
Not a lot of fog on the lake kind of crap, you know.
Yeah, well no one can mix metaphors quite like you Sam.
Here's the title, right... just listen the vampire executions.
Vampires huh?
And the main character get this...
She's a little girl, a murdered girl.
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah, but she's just a kid.
No, no, no, I meant it's beautiful that she gets murdered.
But it's gotta have a lot of story.
Not a lot of style bullshit.
So tell me, how does this execution bit play out?
I, I will find out. I, I mean there's a great... great twist ending.
With heart.
With tons of heart, and I'll get you a complete outline in the morning.
But you gotta get me a check to Denise right away.
I'm not kidding around, in fact, in fact the bank wire transfer would be better.
It’s an emergency you know, you know, I'm thinking, it's not bulletproof.
But hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft doing a vampire story...
- It's not bad.
- Not bad at all.
- If it's got an ending.
- It's got an ending.
- A bulletproof ending.
- Bulletproof but Sam, you gotta tide my wife over okay?
This is why I'm doing it alright?
25 grand.
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars.
That, that's great. I really appreciate it.
As I said, I'm gonna wire
Denise 10,000 dollars...
But I need the outline in the morning or I'm gonna stop payment.
- Sam?
- And no fog on the lake.
The night was... humid.
The night was... cloudy.
Fog. A mist... A mist descends...
On the, on the lake mini, mini, mini...
Unwanipanuki Lake.
The fog... floated out like
Virginia's silent...
Dream.
No, that sucks.
The fog on the lake, the fog on the...
The fog on the lake...
Just to torture Sam.
The scent floats out like...
Tears.
On a whale's ass? No.
The fog on the lake... the flake.
The straight edge razor.
The fog on the lake reminds me of my first wife.
It dissipated with time.
I'd lost my mind.
And now I have a lisp.
And now I'm suddenly turning into a black basketball player.
She... was...
I'm typing as a gay basketball player from the sixties.
I like short shorts.
They are revealing, but it's comfortable.
It helps me jump.
There was no fog on the lake.
Swann valley, sheriff's department.
Deputy arbus speaking.
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go do a bunch of errands for him...
Well, he's not back here at his motel.
If you see him, tell him I'll wait another thirty minutes...
- And that's it... I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.
Why isn't the door locked, arbus?
Yeah, I left it open for you, pj.
- What happened to your diet?
- I was wondering when you were gonna get here with my hamburgers.
Feel like to playing some cards?
Sure, but when are you gonna pay up?
- Hey PJ, get the chord there would you.
- Okay...
Don't ever walk into a morgue like that unannounced.
- My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I knocked.
Yeah, well, sheriff's over at your motel...
And he said
I'll only be here another thirty minutes.
Okay, thanks.
You owe me eighteen bucks, arbus.
Snooze, ropopose, sleep all...
Night all... and you didn't put this on your list. But I liked it. I thought it was good.
- Sleeping all.
- Just what I needed.
Are we gonna work on this together?
That is, what you said.
These are just gonna put you to sleep.
A chance to dream.
- But you didn't read the label’s.
- Yes I did.
This is how you write? I thought that all city writers...
- Just got sauced and then wrote in some kind of trance
- We do... we do but...
There is a bulletproof ending out there and I know just the guy to get me there...
Hey do you know a doctor in town that can give me prescription for a real..Real one?
I can't do that. I'm a public official.
Twilight lights. By Bobby LaGrange.
Her skin was as fresh as cream, floating up from butter...
Under the lace negligee she liked to tease me with.
What keeps bringing you back here?
I'm trying to solve a mystery.
I'm waiting for you, my friend.
Here, by her tomb.
- After you.
- Thank you.
And you are... Edgar Allan poe, so..If you...
How can I help?
Well... I don't have no ending.
Did you know the deacons once corresponded with me...
Concerning the technique... of writing the ending first. And working backwards.
What did you need? Length?
40 to 50 lines... per page.
200 page minimum.
- Providence?
- Beauty.
- The tone?
- They'll tell you.
These points being settled...
- Shall we consider a reframe?
- I like it.
The bell tower is becoming to me.
A reframe must be brief.
In my own work, my most famous...
It's lead me at once to a single word is the best... I'm afraid.
Never more.
The difficulty arose from the presumption that the word...
Must be monopolously be spoken by a human being.
Then immediately arose the idea of a, a non reasoning creature capable of speech...
And, then very naturally a parrot suggested itself.
But it was superceded forthwith immediately by a raven as equally...
Capable of speech, but as a bird of ill omen...
Infinitely more in keeping within intent to turn.
Is all this worth the price of that very good bottle of Irish whisky?
Yes, of course, please continue..
So, I asked myself...
Of all the melancholy topics...
What according to the universal understanding of mankind is the most tragic?
Death.
And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics...
Most poetical?
When it most loosely alludes itself... to beauty.
The death therefore, of a beautiful girl...
Is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world.
Equally it is beyond there that the lips best suited for the topic are those of the man...
Who loved her.
So... I had to combine these two ideas...
Of the lover lamented his deceased mistress...
And the raven' continuously using the word "nevermore" in a poem of about 100 lines.
And "nevermore" of conclusion of each dancer...
In a poem of melancholy tone.
How do you uh, find the ending?
Your story is a tragedy.
It happened here at the old chikering hotel where I once slept.
There were many children in the town.
Orphans some wares, the lost children.
And before long they were taking in to protection of pastor Alan Floyd.
He was a kindly man, loved his kids.
And everyone agreed that he took very good care of them.
He taught them cataclysm, and love of God and goodness.
And one night it happened.
One of his children was missing.
And that's when it came out.
Who isn't here?
Peter?
Where did...
He didn't go across the lake.
Never ever go with the people across of the lake.
This is very important. They are like, like, like... vermin.
Unclean, those, those fiends across the lake.
They are... the undead..
They are vampires.
He took care of them and fed them.
Anointed them with the juices of spoilage, and sinkfoil and wolfsbane.
Anointed them against evil.
- Turn your head.
- Thank you...
That's right. There we go.
Make sure that you be nice and safe.
Someday you will wearing...
Nylon stockings.
- Where the hell is he?
- What are you doing with my mom's ouija board?
- Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?
Innovation is what made the detective story and Charlie Chan entertaining.
Bobby LaGrange... is an innovative detective.
After you, sir.
That, ouija board.
We are in close proximity...
To the deceased.
And the killer is probably still in the area.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in a morgue.
Dim the old lights..
Hello.
- Do we know you?
- Yes, it is.
You're doing that, I can feel you.
- No I'm not.
- Shut up!
H.. I.. M.
Him.
It wants you okay, do we know you?
I...
Am... her.
I am.
Arbus, what was that?
Ask her, let go watch.
Who killed you?
B...
- Sheriff, you're doing that. I can feel it.
- Am not.
Who killed you?
B...
The evil kids at the lake.
They are evil.
And that flamingo kid, he's the one that infects them.
He's a vampire. Is he?
'Yes'.
Come on, arbus. Keep your gun hidden.
- You must be thirsty?
- Exactly.
- I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.
When the sky is low and heavy, weighing as a lid...
On the groaning spirit, falling prey to long boredom...
Educated.. You know baudelaire.
I know life man. And I know the dreams of baudelaire.
And he from the horizon, the entire circle embracing...
A dark day for our poor, even sadder than the nights.
I was hoping you could help me find this missing girl.
She is 12 or 13.
There are a lot of girls here.
You know, people are saying what's going on up here is... evil.
Are you worried about that?
Look around you. Does this look evil to you?
Look at that moon.
It is beautiful.
I have been worried...
It has been 3 days since we've seen her..
She's just a little kid that I take care of, but
I'm worried that something has happened to her.
Arbus. Damn it.
You?
You're out off uniform?
And you're here on unofficial business.
What the hell are you doing here?
He said you were okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.
Mr. collaborator.
I thought we were a team, all the way through this investigation.
Bobby LaGrange does not like to be tricked.
Nor does he like being made a fool out of.
The famous flamingo
..My..My..My the lady killer.
Arbus, arrest this murderer.
He's like that... either coming or going.
Or he's already gone.
- Those are the real keys for the...
- These are them...
- These are the official keys.
- Wow, that's amazing.
- This is to the clock tower?
- Yes, really?
Hey give me, give me that.
Where are you going with that?
- Come on, just to see.
- What? You don't want to go up there.
That's odd, I was up here yesterday...
- And I didn't have a hard time with this lock at all.
- Yesterday?
Uh, maybe it was last week.
- It worked?
- Maybe it was the week before last.
Let me try.
- Here.
- Thanks.
What the hell was that?
You tell me you ever notice anything like that when you were up here?
You're not going up there. This place is haunted. Didn't you know that?
- What's that smell?
- The devil.
The devil lives up there.
You're gonna get it all over yourself.
I'm going out.
Goodbye.
Come with us daddy...
Come with us daddy help me, daddy...
Come with us daddy.
Help me...
Help me... daddy
- Listen,
- What is that?
Are they evil?
No.
No.
Tell me who killed her?
Tell me.
You say that you want to know..
But do you?
- I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.
What choice do I have?
- Tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.
There happened events just make you ashamed to remember.
- Please.
- Thank you, it's a sharp of knife.
I wanna know what the secret ingredient is.
We're going to have special lemonade for everybody.
That's right... good job.
- This stuff stinks.
- Careful.
You cut your finger.
- Here you go, Alice.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
There you go.
Wait. Don't drink the lemonade, he put something in it.
- No, stop.
- No I would like lemonade, Virginia
Virginia, fine. Enough,
..Stand still.
Virginia, is being very...
Very sick.
And we're all going to have some lemonade, it's delicious and sweet... taste it.
- Stay... stay... stay here.
- What are you doing?
Then he made a fateful decision.
Rather than have his children's souls be damned as vampires he drugged their lemonade, and slit their throats.
Can you make him stop?
Do something..
Death of beauty.
One child tried to save herself.
Virginia?
You're playing our favorite game, huh?
I'll find you.
Got you.
Virginia.
Virginia.
One way to God.
One, one, one way to God.
I got you.
Once the monster caught her he put her in chains in the vault.
No.
You must stop screaming.
I told you... God wants you to meet mom.
That's right. Scream all what you want, even God can't hear you now.
One road, one way to God..
One road, one way to God...
All in Jesus name.
During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty... I loved her..
Not as the living and breathing Virginia...
But as the Virginia of the dream.
You see...
Dear friend...
She was my young cousin...
My beloved wife.
Her name was Virginia.
But I gave her many names.
Lenor bernice.
The lady gaia.
Madenasha.
Annabelle Lee.
Alianora.
I assume that I am your partner?...Open the door, wake up.
Wake up.
- Open the door, hall.
- Alright, alright... Hang on.
- Wait 'til you see this.
- What?
I subscribed to "writers weekly."
And this just in...
Says that you took a
10,000 dollar advance on a project called "the vampire executions."
No, no.. That was money for some old writes.
And that money already went to my wife.
That's a mistake.
But I was thinking, I do like
"the vampire executions"...
By hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
Give me my $5,000 dollar now.
There's not gonna be any money exchanged until we get to the story right?
- We gotta get to the end.
- The end?
The end? It's a who done it.
Like every other murder mystery.
- Just let me wake up.
- It comes to who did it.
- Okay.
- What's the matter with you?
- You're foregoing your greatest asset.
- Yeah... What's that?
Bobby LaGrange, the detective..
You gotta take Bobby LaGrange and use him much more throughout the entire story...
Because he could solve the crime himself..
Clearly it's the work of a serial killer.
Someone wants to silence the girls, on the other side of the lake.
Because, they fried a sick mind.
And then they sizzle them, because of some psycho hocus pocus condition...
That condemns them to being the evil sluts that they are.
And that is what's in a sick mind.
You think so, Bobby?
You think they're uh, they're evil sluts?
- Whom?
- The young girls.
Shit yes, they're all into dark things...
Every one of them they worship death...
And sex.
What do you think?
Oh no you don't...
No, not Bobby LaGrange...
Them.
Those devil worshiping whores on the other side of the loch.
Shit yes, they are all in dark thing every one of them. They worship death and sex.
They were just too saucy for their own good.
You know, they have that white flash with the devil inside them.
That little spice you can't stop, thinking about.
- It's not me.
- It's not me.
- It's them.
- It's them...
Flash of the devil.
I saved their souls.
You...
You don't touch me.
Do not touch me. Tearing it out.
- Old bastard.
- Forgive me...
Forgive me for seeking pleasure outside of the company...
Cast me another way for my spirit.
Perhaps, it takes the dirt to be boiled, only here alone?
With all of these things together, thrown...
- Burn it... she shall...
- Flame-proof, bullet-proof.
I can't even look at the cliff, without trembling.
This little cliff?
Wait, wait.
- Do you dare to go further?
- What are you talking about, tell me the ending.
If you don't stop now, every word that flows from your pen will be your your own tale.
You.
You are the ending you seek.
How can I stop now when it's so close to the end?
Then it's time to face the truth.
To end this story, there is no other way.
I am so ashamed, I should cry that's my little girl.
That's my daughter. She wanted me to go with her friends.
I thought they were little boats...
I thought they were childrens boats.
I didn't know they were speedboats.
I couldn't guide them. I was too drunk to wake up that morning.
I was with a woman.
I am so ashamed.
I could have gone, i set the clock, but it was the wrong time so the alarm didn't go off.
I could have been there... but been there, maybe still...
I'm so ashamed...
So ashamed.
Than maybe if I would have been there she would...
I could have been there, i should have been there.
This little girl.
We share this little ghost, my friend.
Our work must be the grave that we prepare for it's lovely tenant.
Oh God...
Help me... help me, daddy..
'Bullet proof'.
You delivered the goods here.
I'm telling you, meat on the bone.
- You think so, Sam?
- I do.
Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft, no more.
Never more.
Could I have a ticket please?
- What's with you?
- What is it, Mr. Patricio?
Why is there a gang of low-class guys watching my show?
Who?
The ones in aisle 6, Lucho.
-  They paid, like everyone else, sir
- No, man.
Tell me. Have you ever seen prostitutes here? Is this a brothel?
Have you seen hookers here?
Do people come to fuck?
Could I have a ticket?
Don't insult me, this is a respectable place.
I don't see the problem, sir.
The problem is that one of those scumbags could leave cum everywhere!
I can't keep tabs on them, Lucho!
“Father, I've sinned,” he says.
“What was your sin?”
“At the beach,
I touched my girlfriend's breasts.”
“Did you do it over or underneath her bathing suit, son?”
“Over, Father.”
“You're an idiot, the sin is the same!”
Thank you!
Here's a good one!
A good-looking girl gets on a bus.
She asks a guy, “Could I have your seat? I'm pregnant.”
“Of course,” he says,
“I hadn't noticed. Please.”
He looks at her and sees her tummy is flat.
“Excuse me, miss, but tell me... how far along are you?”
30 min, but I'm so tired!”
Thank you very much!
You look too skinny.
No one wants to dance with you any more.
I've always weighed this much, Patricio.
That's a lie. You're a liar.
Come back when you've eaten.
You're fired.
Shut up, you faggot...
You're a bag of bones with no tits.
You look like a boy.
Watch what you say.
You'd be nothing without me.
You know very well that the girls here need to be elegant.
You made a monkey the star of the show. Talk about elegant.
You won't be the star of the cabaret!
You fucked up!
I'm the most elegant person you've ever seen.
My house is filled with books, so don't be rude.
I'm Nancy Puelma, asshole.
Who are you?
A fag with a taste for luxury.
First generation to wear shoes.
Nancy Puelma, Nancy Puelma!
Give it a rest!
- I'm not tired.
-  Go home, we'll talk later
How did Fabiana convince you to put her in the show?
Did she pay?
Did she stick a finger up your ass?
Or did you do it because she's younger?
She's not an artist, Patricio.
She doesn't know how to dance.
And her tits sag!
You live across the street, right?
Hello, neighbor.
And you?
What are you up to?
I came to congratulate you.
What's your name, neighbor?
Mario.
See how some people just don't know how to treat me?
If you like...
I can take you home or somewhere else.
Where are you going to take me, neighbor?
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes.
Come on!
There's so many people!
Don't go this way.
- You know what, try backing up.
- Are you sure?
Let's just drive through
- We'll make it.
- Just step on the gas.
Let's drive through.
No, let's drive through.
- I can't.
- Step on it.
- I can't.
- Just step on it.
Victor!
- What are you doing, Nancy?
- Nothing.
What are you doing in this ridiculous car?
I was just going home.
Home?
Are you crazy?
Nobody's going home.
No, I don't like this.
We'll see, come on.
- JJ!
- CC!
Communist Youth of Chile!
Communist Youth of Chile!
Power to the people!
Fighting! Creating!

Poor old thing.
No, cross that out.

Just cross it out, don't erase!
Excuse me?
All right, erase.
Can we continue?
I don't know how you can read your own handwriting.
Lungs pale pink color, with a slight anthracosis.
The cross section reveals an emphysema, enlargement of the cavities and...
Esophagus: pale pink color, with traces of blood.
As the saying goes,
“Sleepy prawns end up in batter”.
Aren't you going to eat it?
No.
May I?
There are things... things and causes that are brought down by their own weight, even if they're not that heavy.
But nobody can escape the wheel of history.
And there, in that crisis, inside that wheel, lies the dialectic contradiction which gives birth to a new man:
Virginal, vigorous, creative, powerful, sober tall...
Shit, the new man!
Now, what I believe is that the solution lies in arms.
The president may not agree, but I think that's the solution.
Arm the people, political parties, social organizations, unions, neighbors...
Everything, armed.
That's how the Vietnamese fought, and that's how we will have to fight.
Ho Chi Minh defeated the empire.
“Ho Chi Minh, we will fight until the end.”
Ho-ho-ho-chi-minh, we will fight until the end!
Mario, want to stop by my house tonight?
Didn't Dr. Castillo stop by the other night?
What does it matter?
The doctor is a friend of mine.
I don't sleep with women who sleep with other men.
It's not right, Sandra.
Really, it's not.
Hello.
Here for the meeting?
Is Nancy home?
Someone's here for Nancy!
My sister's not feeling well.
As usual.
She's always like that.
I see.
Has someone died?
No.
Let me know.
I'm sorry, it's cold.
Want to come in?
We formed a farm workers' federation.
We hadn't finished founding the first and starting the second when I got a call from Santiago.
So I set off to Santiago.
I came in and I realized that I'd have to discuss petitions soon.
Even if I'd gone to the National Library,
I'd need 10 years to read all the books in there, no?
There was no time for anything.
One moment.
Hello.
What do you mean, who?
Speaking.
What?
I can't, I'm busy.
It's truly extraordinary how close our people are getting to fulfilling this hope.
Now our dream is coming true.
I remember when I landed at university in Osorno.
You had to walk up the hill with the typewriter.
Hello.
Can I come in?
I brought you a gift.
I was rude to you.
It wasn't nice.
It's rum. Do you like rum?
They send it to my father.
Your house is pretty.
So is the furniture.
I like your sofas. They're pretty.
Thank you.
What a strong smell!
Smells of cat.
Smells stick to me.
I never forget smells.
I hate cats, they're the worst.
Cats eat with their eyes closed so as not to see who feeds them.
How evil! What a common and suspicious animal.
My house is full of men talking about politics.
The government this, the UP coalition that, I don't know.
None of them wants to have a drink with me.
It's awful.
You sure do have a lot of pictures, don't you?
I like that one, with the oriental motif.
It'd look good in my room.
Can I have it?
Sorry...
No.
Hey
Why do you have so many religious motifs?
I was Catholic.
I went to church and everything.
I did my first communion.
White dress, crown of flowers...
My aunt even did my nails.
The Holy Host would stick to my mouth.
Have you eaten a Host, neighbor?
No, never.
But are you Catholic?
Yes...
When I have something to ask.
Yes, sure I am.
Are you scared of purgatory, neighbor?
I'm terrified of purgatory.
The idea of burning in the flames of hell and never dying seems terrible to me.
Am I too thin, neighbor?
I... think that you're truly... beautiful.
Yes?
I hate fat people, you know.
I'm thin too.
But you're not Nancy Puelma.
No.
No...
You're a gentleman, don't worry.
You are such a gentleman.
I could tell right away.
I interrupted you, didn't I?
You were eating your fried egg with rice.
What a simple man.
How nice.
Can I offer you something to eat, neighbor?
Were you waiting for someone?
Yes.
For you.
How clever.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Is it too cold?
No, not at all.
Good evening.
What is “Hunan”?
It's fried.
Fried what?
Fried pepper. It's good.
Not that. Don't bring that.
- Wonton?
- What?
Spring rolls?
What is that?
It has cabbage.
- Cabbage?
- No, no cabbage.
It must be like a Chinese hot dog.
Bring that.
Rice?
Rice is too heavy for me.
Don't bring rice.
I'll have Peking duck. I'll pretend
I'm eating that son of a bitch.
Anything to drink?
A sherry cocktail, chilled.
And you?
A rum.
Be careful.
Drinking can make you blind.
What am I going to do?
Let's get married.
Well...
What did you say?
Would you like to be my girlfriend?
I don't understand.
I said it clearly enough.
What was your name again, neighbor?
Mario.
What do you do, Mario?
I'm a civil servant.
Civil?
Civil servant.
And why did you bring me here?
To show off.
But what for?
Personal reasons.
Hello.
You're Mr. Patricio, right?
What?
Nancy is a great artist.
Her presence is crucial to the show.
Nancy is my girlfriend.
Do I look like a bitch?
No.
Then why do you wanna fuck me?
Is that car yours?
Yes.
I'll put Nancy back onstage, but I get to keep your car.
Deal?
From Quillota?
I don't think we'll have any problems.
Don't worry, everything will be just fine. It'll go perfectly.
Everything's settled,
I talked to Colonel Perez, and it's fine.
What's your name?
Sandra Carreño.
I'm an assistant to Dr. Castillo.
I perform the dissections.
And you?
Mario Cornejo.
Civil servant.
I transcribe Dr. Castillo's autopsies.
And you?
These are my trustworthy personnel,
Captain.
I would like to go home now.
In a few hours, a lot of people will be coming in.
A state of war has been declared and wars have casualties.
Doctor, you have to do something.
What would you have me do,
Sandrita?
I don't know how you operate, but I'll make sure it works.
I'm looking for someone.
Medium height.
She has brown hair.
And very thin.
5 ft 6, or something like that.
No, I'm not a relative.
I'm her partner.
Nancy Puelma.
No, I don't know anything else.
All right, I'll call back later.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Cornejo, we have to go somewhere.
Where?
An urgent matter.
You'll have to type directly on a machine. OK?
I don't have a machine, sir.
We'll take my secretary's
I've never used it.
It's electric.
Pardon me. Excuse me, Captain.
What?
I don't know where my wife is.
She must be home, where else would she be?
I don't know.
Call her
I'm sure she's at home.
You're right.
She must be home.
Colonel.
Would it be possible to have a safe-conduct pass for this person?
I don't see why not.
Mr. Cornejo.
Congratulations.
You now serve the Chilean Army.
Yes.
External exam.
There's a bullet entrance hole... with an irregular star-shape.
Diameter...
0.78 inches.
It has five tears branching out.
The largest one measuring 0.79 inch.
Both the contour and edges of the orifice... present an abundant... dark and grainy impregnation
The projectile goes through the teguments and perforates the floor of the mouth, causing the tongue to burst.
Together with the amputation of its farthest end, and immediately behind the inferior edge of the inferior maxilla, a congenital fracture.
Did you get that, Cornejo?
Not all of it, Doctor.
Captain?
Bring someone who types.
Excuse me, Colonel.
It penetrates the skull carrying with it a fragment cut from the tongue... which is then embedded in the brain tissue.
The projectile, continuing on its trajectory, opens a path through the encephalic mass, causing its almost total destruction and displacement outside the cranial cavity.
Internal exam.
Internal exam...
Excuse me, Doctor.
I can't.
Conclusions:
Male corpse, identified as
Salvador Allende Gossens.
Cause of death:
A recent cervical-buccal- cranial-encephalic bullet wound, with projectile exit.
The type of shot is what is known in legal medicine as
“point-blank range”.
The shot could have been made by the person himself.
Pituca, come here!
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Nancy!
Neighbor!
Why does Pituca have blood on her?
I took care of her, she's fine
Where's my dad and David?
Where were you?
I got home, it had been blown up, so I crawled in here.
And you?
Working.
They trashed everything.
They can't have taken them.
We don't have anything to do with this
We're peaceful people.
Yes, it's all right.
It's all wrong.
It's very wrong.
Find my brother and my dad.
Go and tell the police.
I'll take care of the dog.
Are you cold?
I'm hungry
Thank you, honey.
Can I come in?
What for?
I'd like an answer
About what?
About what we talked about the other day.
When?
The other day.
In the Chinese restaurant.
Would you get me a radio?
A radio? Yes.
What if they come back?
I'll talk to them
I have a position now.
Will you put something there?
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know Sandra Carreño?
I've been looking for her for days.
If you see her, could you let me know, please?
Thank you, sir!
He killed himself.
He was killed.
He killed himself.
He was killed, Mario.
Good morning.
There are too many people piling up here.
So get to work on performing autopsies and moving them out.
For the casualties that arrive, you count the bullet holes, write down how many bullets and where, sex, date, and approximate age.
And that's it.
We're going to have to assign numbers to them, Captain.
Well, then assign numbers to them.
Afterwards, civil registry personnel will come and take fingerprints.
That is not autopsy protocol, sir.
Sir.
Help...
Thank you.
RESTRICTED ACCESS
Thank you.
What time is it?
I brought you the radio.
Does it need batteries?
No, it's a tube radio.
I need one with batteries.
Batteries?
You must find my dad and brother.
They've disappeared.
Please find them, OK?
All right, all right...
What happened here?
Why are these people here now?
What happened?
Why are they here now?
Loom
What happened?
Marito? Help me...
I can't take it any more, Marito...
Doctor...
What happened?
You have to do something.
This nurse was fine.
I was just with her! Why is she here?
And he's injured.
What happened?
I don't understand...
You have to do something!
Tell them what they're doing here!
When will they stop this?
Why don't they get it over with?
What happened?
These people were here, alive, because I saw them!
Because I saved this man!
He was wounded and I saved him!
What happened?
Sons of bitches! Stop this at once!
I said I saved him!
And you have to stop this!
- Make it stop, Doctor! Tell him!
- You saved him?
Tell them to stop!
Yes! I saved him!
And you killed him again!
You killed him again! Why?
This man was here, alive!
Hello.
Hello, Mario.
Thank you for everything, comrade.
I can't hear you.
Thank you very much for everything, comrade.
Listen, Mario.
Mario, right?
Excuse me, but...
Would you bring us some food?
Anything.
Thank you, neighbor.
Bring me cigarettes, neighbor.
Go on.
Subtitling TITRA FILM Paris
A SERBIAN FILM
Baby, I'm gonna fuck you up!
Are you insane?
Haven't we agreed about putting away your flicks?
What's that?
Give it to mommy.
Sorry, but it's not a big deal.
I saw my first porn when I was his age.
How are you, kiddo?
But your dad wasn't starring in it!
Marija, I'm sorry
I didn't mean it.
I dug up that DVD because...
Lejla called and wanted to see me today.
Baby, you want mommy to make you a toast?
The jumping bread!
Mom, what was dad doing there?
Nothing, hon.
Just playing with a girl friend.
It's like a cartoon for the grownups.
Honey, I have to pay for Petar's singing lessons.
- Bye, dad.
- Bye, dad.
Easy on that whiskey.
Rye kills sexual appetite.
That's why I drink it.
- So, how's family life?
- Nice.
How are Petar and... Marija?
Yes, Marija.
They're fine.
Petar's starting school next year.
It'll be interesting when they ask about his father's occupation.
His father is a fine gentleman in a premature retirement.
The problem with that pension is that it's not lifelong.
How much money do you have stashed away?
5 or 10 grand?
Miloš, you were more than just a porn star.
You were an artist.
All actresses you worked with wanted to marry you.
You're still an artist, but with a temporary block.
And...
I'm your guardian angel.
Listen. Something big is about to happen.
Artistic pornography of the highest level.
Here, in Serbia.
In Serbia?
Only filmed here, but for the foreign market.
Terribly professional.
Phenomenally paid.
If you accept, your family will be settled till the end of Petar's life.
The man's name is Vukmir.
He'll call you in a few days.
Be nice to him.
Here's something for the junior.
Wow, where's his pussy?
You didn't tell me you brought your policeman brother here.
I came on my own.
I knew you'd be here and couldn't miss a chance to see you.
I'm your great admirer.
You're well preserved.
Who's the plastic surgeon we have to thank to?
You know I started early.
I don't need plastic yet.
Everybody needs it.
These don't.
So long, fags.
Miloš, you heard my advice.
- A hooker!
- A porn star.
Has-been.
You know the kind of work she did after you married?
I know.
No one could handle a dick like she could.
A natural talent.
Funny she hasn't contacted her dealer in the past few years.
Is she off drugs?
Doubtful.
A new, rich provider, more likely.
You'll alienate me from my friends if you keep checking on them.
Friends, in Serbia?
You can't check them enough.
I gotta go.
Say hello to your kid and his beautiful mom.
I'm paying for the bite.
- So long.
- Bye.
Sleeping time, hands up.
- Dad?
- Yes?
Know that friend of yours that you were beating in the video?
It's only a movie. Make believe.
When dad was young.
I know, but while
I was watching it
- I felt something strange.
- What?
Like some kind of a wheel, spinning.
- A wheel? Where?
- Down there, near my willie.
Several of them, like a family, traveling.
Do they live in me?
They do, hon, in all of us.
We all have them.
- Everyone in the world?
- Yes, everyone.
They're gone now, so close your eyes think of them and you'll fall asleep faster.
What language is that?
I'm translating for some Swedes.
Swedish? I'm great in it.
That's right.
Wait, I know more.
Listen to this.
You would be a mega star.
So, you say Lejla is offering you a serious job?
So she said.
It's strange.
Why would anyone offer me big money after such a long pause?
In Serbia?
And after all the crap
I shot, look at this.
Maybe they need the only porn star with a university diploma.
Do you miss it?
- What?
- The job.
I don't know. No.
I miss the money, so we could escape away from here.
All those poor girls you threw away like condoms...
How come you've never done me like them?
Well, I love you.
I've just fucked them.
Does it mean that you never wanted to fuck me?
Am I talking to the
Balkan sex god.
The Nikola Tesla of the pornography world ?
You must be Vukmir?
Of course. Miloš, if you're ready to change your life
right now and provide for your family for good
a car will be waiting at your door in 30 minutes.
You just hop in, and take a ride towards fulfillment
of your personal and my professional fantasies.
Can't wait to meet you!
I'm honored to shake the hands of such a great artist, I'm Vukmir.
I'm Miloš, nice to meet you.
The right hand... is the sex center of any man.
It's direct line between your brain and cock.
Ever since your childhood.
Your hand is special for it has jerked such a special cock.
Miloš.
It's an honor to shake the hand of such an artist of fuck.
Pornography is art, but people can't see that!
Why not?
Bebecause they just want to jizz into a napkin what they can't into a woman.
These movies are mostly made so that those who can't get laid can cum.
They're made by butchers who can't tell a camera from a broom.
Their 'actors' would be fucking a hole in the wall if there were no pussy.
Do you know what proves that there is art in pornography?
What?
You.
You, Miloš.
You are the proof!
Your sense of handling a woman, your rhythm of exhausting her, your talent to humiliate her, and then, when she is reduced to a dog-shit, to win her back.
And your love for it, that's art.
Sadly, this is no country for real art.
Where there is no life, there can't be real art.
A real talent will rot here, while maggots are giving press conferences.
Have you done anything
I could've seen?
I'm doing stuff that no one else is.
Just for the selected clients.
All right, but what is it?
Art, naked art!
Truth.
Real people, real situations, real sex... minimal editing.
There's a serious script.
We know it, you don't!
And what am I supposed to do?
The same as always, Miloš.
Just stand before the cameras, whip out your cock, and fuck until it's raw.
I dunno, I'm a little tired of cameras and fucking.
You're also tired of humping scum any time your family needs money.
Kissing some wretched cunts with the same lips you'd kiss your kid.
Thanks, doctor.
- What's that?
- The contract.
No need to read all, just the numbers.
Something wrong?
I don't know what I'm signing, what I'm shooting.
You're not supposed to know.
If you knew, you wouldn't be so good.
In a winter night way up the hill.
A creek was frozen and covered by the snow.
A bunny's weeping for that frozen creek
young bunny's crying with all his heart.
But poor li'l bunny there upon the hill
perhaps hes after the swallows heading for a warmer South.
Vukmir.
Sounds like a name of one of those guys at the Hague tribunal.
Are you sure he's not an arms dealer?
No, he's some kind of an artist philosopher with a grand plan.
Is it?
I don't know.
But it seems like he desperately needs me since he's willing to offer so much money.
How much?
I won't tell you.
Yes you will, or I'm not giving it back.
Ok, I'll tell you, just let go.
Don't tell me you refused?
Of course I did.
I wanted to see if you're with me for the money.
If I were, I'd have dumped you for your brother long ago.
So, you prefer poor porn stars to bad cops.
Does it means that I should rent my dick to Vukmir?
Remember what you told me when
I asked if you missed your job?
Miloš, I want both of your heads to be clear and hard.
If it's true...
If what is true?
That you were always able to have it erected without touching or looking.
Like a cock at dawn, rising to its own song.
I also know that you filmed all your scenes in the first take.
Don't be so modest. you're the best, that's why you're here.
How long do you think it would take?
A few days.
I haven't translated from Russian since 1994.
What is it exactly?
Some take-over contract?
We're sending some goods to Moscow for redistribution.
- Want one?
- Yes.
No thanks.
You said you would.
Oh, sorry.
I'm a bit...
I miss female company.
A least you can always arrest a fine looking lady.
Yes, but I doubt I'll ever have the real thing.
A relationship, marriage.
Like two of you.
You stopped hoping too soon.
Women here like men in uniform.
Especially if they're not wearing it.
Sorry, gotta go to the bathroom.
You know what they say about rye.
It's high time you started taking care of yourself.
With great talent comes a great desire for self-fuckability.
- When exactly, do we start?
- In three days.
I'm not comfortable with not knowing a thing.
Miloš, get a grip.
You're a porn actor who wants to know what a porno film is about?
It's a bit absurd.
You're not supposed to know, but only to relax.
That's too much money to leave anything to accident.
Nothing is left to accident.
Miloš.
This is a serious organization.
My clients know exactly what they want, and I know what I'm doing.
Don't worry, everything is already prepared, you just have to appear, be what you are, relax and react as Miloš would.
Pornography should not be an illusion, but a live transmission of sex.
- Dad.
- Yes, son.
Remember the little wheels?
I do.
Do you know how to make them spin?
I do.
But you must do it yourself.
We all do it alone.
Tell me how.
When you feel them, try to follow them.
It's a family traveling and you just close your eyes and follow them.
Wait, the wheels are spinning better at night.
Put it in your ear.
Enter the building, relaxed.
"Home for Abandoned and Orphaned Children"
Walk slowly ahead.
Be natural.
I wish I impaled myself on a fence rather than giving birth to you!
Haven't I told you not to let the villains take you away?
Get lost, you misbegotten wretch!
What are you staring at?
Bravo.
What was it like?
Fine.
We were filming at a home for orphaned children.
Where?
Drag yourself over here!
Look at yourself.
You can't raise a dick, how will you raise a child?
The child is mine.
Raiko only made it.
I gave birth to it.
Come, you bitch!
Let me go, villains!
Give me back my child, you bastards!
- Honey?
- Hi.
What are you doing?
I picked up Petar from classes.
I'm taking him to a costume party.
Are you coming?
No, I'm tired.
I must get some sleep.
Everything all right?
Sure. You two enjoy yourselves.
I'll talk to you later, we must park now. Bye.
The cake is coming.
Never seen such a cake in my life.
- Aren't you in action?
- Marko, you must do me a favor.
I'm all dick.
I need a detailed background check on my director, producer, pimp, goddam businessman, Vukmir.
I don't know his last name.
Check his whole crew.
Little bro has changed his views on checking his friends?
Look, it's important and urgent.
Understood.
Everything Ok with you?
Yes, so far.
How about you?
Working on it.
Light the candles.
Happy birthday, dear Petar...
Baby, the time is flying and your 'animal' is snoozing again.
Come on, blow harder.
Blow harder.
- Blow harder.
- Bravo!
Now we're gonna open the present from uncle.
This is the present from your uncle.
How do you open this?
Happy birthday, my sweet son.
What do you think, how does he manage to be hard for so long?
It's not a dick, it's a police baton.
If you don't know,
I can't help you.
Those bitches are leaking all over, and he's servicing all three of them.
How come he's not tired?
Why isn't he fucking limp, like all the normal people?
You're at it again!
That's hardly gonna shape it like we all want.
What was so urgent?
You tell me, what are we shooting?
Are those cameramen real cops?
Are they protection? From what?
Cut the crap!
You're drunk, nearly impotent and turning dumb.
I may be dumb, but not naive.
Vukmir knows what he's doing.
I trust him more than myself.
They're the greatest pros you've ever worked with.
What've you done previously with those pros of yours?
Don't take it all out on me because
I fuck animals for art's sake, while you can't take a bit of uncertainty for some big bucks.
Does it mean I'll have to suck a donkey's dick for money?
It's not so bad, trust me.
Better than the crap you've been in lately.
- You know I miss that.
- What?
The certainty of that crap.
At least I knew what I was filming.
Alright, do you miss this?
You're losing it.
Lucky for you
Vukmir hasn't noticed yet.
You're resting from healthy life.
How was the costume party?
- What's that?
- It's a balloon.
Your Raiko was a war hero.
If only he knew about his wife’s whoring!
He would've killed both you and that poor child of yours.
What the hell is all this, people?
Hello, I can't work like this!
Hit the whore.
Hit the whore!
Hit her.
Bravo, bravo!
Magnificent!
Miloš?
- Miloš, what's wrong?
- I'm not doing this.
I'm not beating women in front of kids or cameras.
Miloš, Jeca is our kid.
I'd never dream of hurting her.
Her mother fucked everything, from stones to barbed wire.
You're like a Sunday picnic for her.
I'm not only an artist but also a professional.
I'd never do a thing against one's will.
You're going against mine.
I won't stand any kind of torture.
Yeah, you seem to know a lot about torture.
Did you enjoy it less than that midget woman who you locked up in an oven in Stuttgart and pierced a hole in it so she could suck you off for hours?
At least your dick enjoyed it, and he never lies.
Vukmir Vukmir.
His name is also his surname.
Worked as a psychologist in orphanages until 1992.
Then he moved to the Children's Program of the State TV.
It's getting better and better!
A lifelong fascination with the world of film.
Now, it follows with a mess I had to clarify with data from the State Security.
Allegedly, he worked for them, too.
Sent abroad on a mission, his trace was lost in Japan.
If he's done any movies, no one's seen them.
That's about it.
I don't know what bothers you.
According to this you've never worked with a more educated man.
Who are you gonna trust if not a child psychologist who is working for the Security?
Hit it, dad, tear it, dad, uncle Vukmir is shooting.
Want something to eat?
No, I've had my daily dose of rye.
You don't have to go, you can do it over the phone.
No, I must show up.
It wouldn't be fair.
Today we're shooting at home again.
Without me.
As today, I'm retiring.
Is there any way for me to convince you otherwise?
No.
The kids bother me. I can't do such stuff in the kindergarten.
I fully understand you.
But, in that case between you and the kids,
I must choose kids. They're my specialty, my whole life.
It's my fault. I thought you'd be better if you didn't know...
If I had known from the start,
I'd only have declined sooner.
What did you say, kindergarten?
That's a good term.
This whole fucking country is one big shitty kindergarten.
A bunch of kids discarded by their parents.
Do you know what it feels like?
Your whole life you're compelled to prove that you're able to take care of yourself.
To prove that you can shit, eat, fuck drink, bleed, earn money... do whatever it takes to survive.
Until you die!
Would you believe me if I told you that me and this wonderful family, that you're so anxious to leave are the only warrant of this nation's survival?
We are the backbone of this country's economy.
Only we can prove that this nation is alive and useful for anything.
I can see that you're insane,
I need no proof for that.
Just tell me, how does it all connect to pornography?
No, Miloš, no, no!
Not pornography.
Not pornography, but life itself!
The life of a victim.
Love, art, blood...
Flesh and soul of a victim.
Transmitted live to the world who has lost all that and now is paying to watch that from the comfort of an armchair.
I have no doubt that it sells well based on the sum you offered me.
Victim sells, Miloš.
Victim is the priciest sell in this world.
The victim feels the most and suffers the best.
We are victim, Miloš.
You, me, this whole nation is a victim.
We're just too retarded.
And I won't be a victim bebebecause of that.
But Miloš... you're the only one in this film who is not a victim!
Is that so?
Allow me, as your shepherd to show you the power of a real victim.
Can it be that you don't get it?
This is a new genre, Miloš!
A new genre!
Newborn porn!
Newborn!
...so that tomorrow, on 18th of May...
...you'll witness a new Serbian jet-set extravagance...
Mobile user is not available at the moment...
Mobile user is not available at the moment...
If you only knew how easily cattle aphrodisiac is diluted in whiskey.
Actually, rye doesn't kill sexual desire at all, right?
Viagra for bulls!
A special recipe concocted by our sexy doctor who is so fond of speed that she puts it into coffee, too.
Can he follow my words?
Now, that's our stud!
Look at him, look at him!
Bravo, bravo!
She's a dirty junky cunt!
She destroyed her child, daughter of a war hero!
Sweet little Jeca watched her mother fuck the junky bums.
She is scum.
Hit the whore! Hit the bitch!
Yeah, you bitch!
Yes, that's one of the bitch-mothers
who conceive babies in lust
and than throw them into a river.
The lustful brood of wenches
with endless gashes in them.
Imagine she were your son's mother.
Imagine her turning Petar into a dog-fucker's bitch!
Imagine that, Miloš!
Strike her, hit her!
That's it!
Bravo!
The unique magic of rigor mortis!
That's right, make it right.
Fucking cell!
What?
Never mind, he'll come to me.
Don't worry, he will.
Fucking hell.
Ok, run now.
This one is on me.
Now you ruined it all.
You've destroyed the project.
I did what? How?
You could've drugged any of your apes to fuck like insane.
You had Miloš. Now you don't.
Now he's a headless dick.
If only you sliced, say, his son's ear
he'd be his old self again!
He'd fuck God in the ass at your command!
Instead, you take a genius and fill him with a fuck-dope.
You're cheap, just like everyone else.
Fear is bad.
It's a downer.
He needs to rise high. To feel the ecstasy of a free fuck.
When he feels it, he'll forget all
including his wife, son, mother...
What do you know about free fuck?
What do you know of ecstasy?
This is no art.
You're no longer an artist!
I'm not working for you anymore.
Nor is Miloš.
I'm taking him home.
Get away from me!
God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...
God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us... from that whore, may she rest in peace,
She was a shame to our house.
Raiko was a great warrior, but had a poor taste in women.
Since he was killed, this house rots with no male to govern it.
That's why God sent you as our savior from all worry.
There's not only house, but a daughter to take care of, too.
Our poor Jeca became an orphan.
My Alice in Wonderland.
Raiko was killed just when he was supposed to prove to Jeca that he's not only a father, but a man as well.
You came instead of him.
You'll have the honor of giving her a virgin's communion.
To make her a woman.
Like my late father did with me.
Come on, come on...
Now!
I'm gonna cut it off, you motherfuckers!
No, Miloš, no...
Our film jumped through the window!
What are you waiting for?
After him!
- Marko, it's me. Come for me.
- Miloš, what's wrong?
- Where are you?
- I'm on Celopecka street, no 7.
Come and get me.
Miloš!
Hey, baby, where you headin' for?
Out naked, but won't take a dick?
Be polite, the girl is underage.
So what if I am underage?
Look at this jerk!
No, Raša, don't.
Rare kind of Monks put seven adult he-goats
into a shed during summer.
They leave them for a month
until their balls are like melons.
When they get too hot, they start fucking one another.
The monks take the dried bloody cum off their balls
and mix it with milk.
It makes the finest bread spread there is.
You're a he-goat, Miloš.
I'm your monk.
Don't worry, my child.
My he-goat.
I'll provide a fitting end for you.
Welcome to a warm family home.
A real, happy Serbian family.
Life...
Art.
That's it, Miloš.
That's cinema.
That's film!
Get away from me!
In a winter night way up the hill.
A creek was frozen and covered by the snow.
Come on.
Start with the little one.

A SERBIAN FILM
I can take this, right?
Sure.
My doctor says,
"You can't have a garlic knot.
" I mean...
- Really?
- From mama Lucia's?
Your--no, not right now, thank you.
- Whoo. Is she new?
- You've met Jenny before.
Oh, is she Gordon's assistant? Hey, where's Gordon?
Look, if the doctor's telling you not to have garlic knots,
Don't have the garlic knots.
Okay, I won't. -
All right, just take care of yourself, would you?
What do you want to talk about?
There's this investment property
That I want you to see. - Uh-huh.
And in this climate, it'd be an incredible opportunity.
Before I do anything with it,
I want to get your opinion.
My opinion? Why?
Because you have real estate/business acumen, son.
- Acumen?
- Yeah.
We'd have to drive there, stay overnight.
Come on, dad. I don't have time to go stay overnight somewhere.
Where is this place?
It'd be like father and son time, you know.
We could get a chance to talk, Adam.
We don't have enough of that.
I'll call Kristina.
I'll just make sure it's clear with her, okay?
That's all I wanted to hear.
- All right.
- All right.
You're not gonna be sorry.
All right.
You want some garlic knots?
Why don't I take those from you?
No. I'll have as many garlic knots as I want.
Your real estate acumen?
He used the word "Acumen"?
- Yup.
- That's worrisome.
Yeah, I was wondering if he wanted me
To go in on a piece of,
I don't know,
Vacation real estate with him or something.
Then he tried to sell it to me as father and son time.
Yikes.
Hey, speaking of which,
I brought something over
I want you to look at.
Yeah, what's that?
That's great. What about it?
- That's great?
- Yeah.
You don't think it's weird to receive an invitation
To your son's birthday party in the mail?
You're lucky you got invited at all.
Hey, whose side are you on?
There are no sides here.
You just got to pay attention to your kid.
Yeah, listen, I've been spending
A lot of time with Jabbar, okay?
He knows me pretty well now, and he's smart,
So if I don't plan this party,
He's gonna sense that.
Great chair.
- You like this?
- Yeah, high quality.
Look, if you want to be there,
Just, you know, give Jasmine a call
And tell her you want to be a part of it.
She's just sending a lot of mixed messages.
It's, like, half the time she wants me to be the dad,
And then the other half, she's keeping me on the outside.
I just wish she would pick a path and stick to it.
Well, then you should go.
You should call Jasmine and say you want in.
Except you shouldn't use those words.
I don't get it.
Is there a sexual joke in there?
Amber, I'm coming in.
Mom, can you just give me a minute?
I'm showering. - Yes.
Can you give me a minute?
I'm just brushing my teeth.
Hey, do you have the toothpaste in there?
- No, no, no.
- oh, my God!
Hey, Mrs. Bra-- it's just me.
No, you're dead.
Get out! No, not now.
Later.
We're screwed.
Ah! You have got to be kidding me.
Excuse me, but who the hell is that running out of my house?
Amber! Jeez.
- Dad, it's Amber's boy-
- ex-boyfriend from Fresno.
Don't--don't worry about it.
I can't get any privacy.
Why are you being such a tattletale?
Wait-- Damien, the demon seed?
Why is everybody yelling at me?
We got to set some boundaries, Amber.
Calm down, grandpa.
- I'm not yelling at ya.
- Yes, you are.
- It's okay.
- It's my house!
All right,
I'll take care of it, dad.
I know you're mad at me.
What do you mean?
I'm not mad at you.
You're mad at me because of Mr. Cyr.
Because of dating your teacher.
Please, it has nothing to do with that.
And I know you're still mad, and I'm sorry.
It's fine. I don't care.
I'm sorry I went out with your teacher.
It's fine.
We left Fresno, you know, so you could have a better life.
And I pulled you away from a lot of things,
But he was one of 'em.
And then, to have him here in the shower,
I mean, Amber, come on.
Don't screw everything up for yourself
Just because you're mad at me.
This doesn't have anything to do with you.
Not everything I do is about you.
I love him, and he loves me, okay?
Oh, God.
What?
Why do you insist on making every mistake I made?
You know, every time you talk about your life being a mistake,
All I hear is that my whole existence is a mistake
And you... - Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
I don't want to talk to you right now.
Honey, I don't want to leave you so upset.
Please leave me alone, okay?
Please? I don't want to talk to you.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm really sorry.
It's fine, mom!
Please, just leave me alone. - Okay.
I'll come back.
Don't take any rubber bands off, please!
Wait, wait, whoa. Why?
Well, because I've got 'em all counted up.
18 blue,
53 reds,
118 brown. There's too many brown.
And I don't want the brown rubber bands to take over.
I want my ball.
I want my ball! - Okay.
All right, you know what?
Let's go upstairs.
We're gonna finish getting ready,
And we will talk more about this in the morning.
- I want my ball.
- No. No.
Hey, hey. - I want my ball!
Sweetheart, the ball is staying right here, okay?
- Please, I want my ball.
- No.
We will not touch it.
I promise you.
We're not gonna change it. Okay?
I promise.
Now get upstairs.
You know who I am?
I'm sorry.
Your Amber's grandfather,
The Vietnam vet.
Well, Damien, gee,
I'm just sure you're a nice guy,
And everything, but you left your sock in my house,
But you took my granddaughter's innocence.
Here's your sock.
I'm gonna give you a 20,
And I want you to fill up your tank,
And I want you to clear out of here.
And I'm asking you nicely.
What about Amber?
Damien, if this van is within a five-mile radius of my house, I'll know it.
'cause I can smell it.
And then you and I are gonna have a visit,
And I'm gonna spend some quiet time with you.
Do I make myself clear?
Sir, I just want to let you know
That I consider myself a student of philosophy.
Live and let live.
I mean no harm to anyone.
I am an irrational hardass with rage issues.
Don't piss me off.
- Come in, come in.
- Thanks.
What's happening?
- Oh, um...
- Good to see you.
Just--yeah.
I was gonna make some tea.
Do you want some?
- Sure.
- Chamomile or orange pekoe
Or green? - Whatever. Perfect.
- Whatever? Okay.
- Hi, Max.
Max, buddy, aunt Julia just said hi to you.
Oh, did you know that pill bugs and sow bugs
Are often mistakenly thought of as insects,
But they're actually classified in the group called isopods...
He got a new book on roly-polies today.
Hey, buddy, honey, aunt Julia's probably not in the--
Honey. So Adam is not here.
He's at the office. Um...
That's fine. I actually wanted to talk to you.
What's going on?
This is gonna sound stupid.
- Okay.
- It has to do with this ball.
Sydney's obsessed with it,
And basically I just wanted to ask you
If you could tell me about, you know, some of the first signs
That you saw with Max.
Um, why don't you have a seat?
- Okay.
- And I will be right back.
I'm just gonna try to rally him to get upstairs.
What were you guys talking about?
- Nothing, babe.
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
- Can you do mommy a favor?
I need to talk to aunt
Julia about something.
Honey, please, I just want to talk
To aunt Julia for a little bit, okay?
Thank you. - Come up soon so I can get
My stickers. - I will. I promise.
Thank you. Okay.
Um, I am 100% sure that you have nothing to worry about at all.
How can you be sure about that?
Well, I'm not sure,
But I don't really understand. I mean...
Okay, she counted the number of rubber bands.
She knows how many of each color there are.
And she's so utterly fixated on it
That she can't make eye contact anymore if you talk to her.
Okay. You know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you Dr.
Pelikan's number.
He's our doctor that we use for Max.
He's amazing.
And he'll be able to tell you if anything's going on,
Which I really don't think that there is anything wrong.
I really don't. - Okay.
I just wouldn't worry about it.
Yeah, I'm--I'm, you know... - Oh, Julia.
- I'll be fine.
- It's okay.
Oh, so stupid. I'm sorry.
It's not stupid at all.
It's not.
I'm a horrible person, honey. - Why?
Because when Julia told me there might be something wrong
With Sydney, part of me felt glad and happy and, like--
- A big part?
- Like I couldn't stop myself.
It was weird. It was like this feeling just came over me--
Well, I think that's human,
And I don't think that's horrible.
What would be so wrong with having somebody else
In the family like Max? - Well, it doesn't feel fair.
Exactly. And he would be less isolated.
We'd be less isolated.
You're horrible too.
You are-- you're horrible too.
You were thinking it.
I'm not horrible.
You're the horriblest.
And those jeans are just terrible.
Why do you think my dad thinks
I have real estate acumen?
I think he's up to something.
Take these instead.
You should have seen your sister's face, though.
She was totally freaked out.
Look at Sydney compared to Max.
There's no way that these kids have the same thing.
Maybe she has a.D.D.
Yeah, or o.T.B.
Off-track betting? - O.C.D.
Yeah, there you go.
Whatever it's called.
I don't know.
I did do one good thing.
What's that?
I didn't tell her
About Max's rubber band ball.
Well, see, you're not horrible.
- I know.
- You're a sweetie.
I am sweet.
- Kaboom.
- Pow.
Let's try that again.
Kaboom!
All right. - Okay, I feel better.
Thank you. - You're welcome.
Now you could make me feel better.
I'll get you the lotion.
- All right.
- Right back. Lotion rub.
Ooh, Batman. What do you think?
We did Batman two years ago.
Does he like g.I. Joe?
His friend had a g.I.
Joe party last month.
Well, I know he likes spongebob.
He loves spongebob.
We did that last year.
Maybe I should have asked for the list of things
That you've already done.
You wanted to come here.
It was your idea.
Well, he's my kid.
I want to plan his party.
I want to be a part of this.
How about this? Baseball.
Think it'd be cute?
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah?
Yeah, bravermans love baseball.
- Great.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Paper plates and utensils.
About a dozen.
Okay, wait, a dozen?
That's not even gonna cover my family.
Wait a minute.
Are you saying my family's not invited?
You've seen my apartment.
It's tiny.
Yeah, well, they're his family too.
Okay, so how about you invite four from your family?
I'll just--like survivor.
I'll just pick four.
All right, how many people from your family are going?
- I don't know.
- Whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, you don't know?
I don't know.
Like, 10, maybe 15.
Oh, just 10 or 15.
Fine. Just, will you promise me
That we're gonna have an a's theme party
And not a giants?
- A's?
- Yeah.
Step aside.
Oh, you-- you don't--oh.
This is gonna get ugly.
Sydney is a great kid.
She is playful and cooperative.
Thank you.
What's wrong with her?
Is something wrong with her?
- Julia, just...
- I wouldn't say wrong.
She doesn't test in the norl range.
Sydney is gifted.
- I'm sorry. What?
- She's--
She tests
Way above average intelligence for her age.
Her issues in school are probably coming from boredom.
So iou have to make sure that she's in an environment
Where she is being challenged.
Something that you'll have to monitor over time,
And something that, as parents,
You have to be aware of, pay close attention to.
- I think we can do that.
- Good.
We're driving in the slowest lane.
What are we doing, about 30?
- Hey, I'm driving.
- Not very well.
You're driving in the slowest lane.
Do you remember the trip to the grand canyon?
Yeah. It was a good time.
Yeah. Remember, you vomited all over your mother's head?
You know what, dad, that wasn't me.
That was Crosby.
All right.
Well, go ahead and deny it.
Blah!
You know, I had a little confrontation
With the kid, and maybe I was a little hard on him.
I'm not sure.
Scared the hell out of him.
- All right.
- Do you think they caught
The zodiac killer?
Move over. We got a lane open.
You know what-- dad, dad, dad.
How's the sex life?
My sex life is fine. Why?
That's not what I'm hearing.
You learned to have sex in Vietnam?
Yeah, basically.
Well, I was a kid, you know?
I mean, gosh, those girls could teach you so much, you know.
Just--I was ready to learn.
She's not having orgasms?
So you were okay?
It was all Kristina's fault?
'cause the bravermans, you know, the braverman men,
You know what I'm saying. - Look.
We're strong in the sexual department, son.
Is this embarrassing to you?
Yeah. Yeah, it is a little bit.
- I'm gonna tickle you.
- Get off.
Is this why you wanted to come out here and take this drive?
Because you wanted to talk about this?
No, there's something
I want to uhow you...
Do you want to tell me what it is you're gonna show me?
No, I don't. I want to keep it as a surprise.
It's gonna be very exciting.
Now I got to pee.
How about a rest stop?
What are you, five years old?
How do you unscrew this thing?
Don't pee in the cup.
I'll pull over up here.
Hello?
Who's there?
Hey, miss braverman.
What are you doing here?
Are you kidding me?
If my father sees you...
He hinted that I should wash up,
But then I saw these plants that needed attention.
Damien, listen, you seem like a, you know, an okay guy,
But Amber's from a broken home.
Do you know what that means?
She doesn't know a serious relationship
From a sandwich yet, and the point is
I want her to focus on herself,
On her future, school, maybe even college.
- Yeah.
- There's an old expression.
If you love someone, set them free.
If they come back, they're yours.
If they don't, they never were.
You know what I mean?
It's not that easy.
You're right.
It isn't that easy.
But it would really help her out.
Just for now, you know.
Oh. Oh, boy.
I got this. - You got this.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- I got this. Okay.
- I believe in you.
- Kristina.
- How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
I only have a minute.
Can I come in?
- Oh, please.
- Okay, great.
How you doing today?
- I'm good.
- Yeah?
Yeah, thank you. We're good.
We're good.
I just wanted to stop by
And drop off a couple of books for you.
- Oh.
- They were a real comfort to Adam and me.
And I also wanted to tell you the other day
When you stopped by,
I don't think that I fully expressed to you
How I feel about you and
Sydney and your family.
And I just-- I want you to know
That you're with us in our hearts.
Thank you so much.
We love you too, and, no, I knew that.
If you need any-- - yeah,
Kristina...
Yeah?
You know...
We-- as soon as we hear anything...
- You'll call me.
- I will call you.
Exactly. Thank you.
- We don't know yet, so...
- Yeah.
We'll see. Okay.
- I gotta run.
- Okay, great.
You have a good day.
Okay, thanks. You too.
Okay. Bye.
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.
Wha-- - you were so strong.
I thought she took that rather well.
She just went out with Damien
And didn't even bother to lie about it.
That's good, right?
No, it's not good.
In this context, it shows
A complete lack of respect.
Sweetie, you can't live their life for them.
You know?
Really. The best you can do is help them avoid making some of the mistakes you made.
That's about it.
I failed at that already.
You haven't.
Why didn't I just let dad kill him?
I'm out here quoting
Jonathan Livingston seagull
Like an idiot.
You were obsessed with that book.
And Amber liked it too, didn't she?
Why does she hate me, mom?
Daughters hate their mothers.
I think it's a law of nature.
But you know what?
Then they come back.
Sarah...
You're my best one.
Maybe not my best one, but you're the one that I...
Most identify with.
Not perfect Adam?
No.
You're the brave one.
You take risks.
You always took a chance.
You declared your independence pretty early on,
And you went for it.
You have to honor that person.
That you are.
'cause I do.
I mean, maybe I never said it
In, you know, those exact words before,
But...
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, sweetie.
I promise.
Think about this. If you buy it,
How long are you gonna have to hang on to it
Before it pays off? -
Well, that's the great thing, son, is I already own it.
Well, then what do you need me for?
Well, look, before I do anything else with it,
I was thinking what a great opportunity this would be For you, you know, for your company, right?
A new manufactory and a factory,
You know, that sort of thing.
And I was thinking that your company
Could buy it from me for a price...
Adam, when it comes back, this place is gonna be untouchable.
It's gonna be a great investment opportunity.
Who the hell, you know, wants to build a factory
In Thailand or Mexico?
I mean, come on.
You got the savings right here.
Plus, you can hire
American workers.
Now you're into that, right? - Yeah, definitely.
Well, who owns the rest of the complex?
- Office park.
- Sorry.
Other entities.
I mean, some of it's in foreclosure.
That's why the construction is stalled,
But I mean, come on, it's still got--
Still got plenty of advantages.
Hey, you still got that- the camera thing on your phone?
- Yeah.
- Well, okay, come on.
Why don't you take some pictures,
And right over here,
You can take 'em back to the office
And discuss it amongst yourselves
And all of that, right?
I mean, Adam, son, you're looking at some raw space.
- Definitely raw space.
- All right?
You get it? - Yup.
Oh, whoa, that goes right on this wall here.
I thought you said put it here.
So? I want that here.
So you just want to have two things hanging here
And then nothing over there? - Yup.
That's how your family does it?
How my fam-- wait, what are you,
The party expert now?
How many parties have you thrown?
Yeah, whose fault is that?
We are not gonna go there right now.
No, we're doing this right now.
No, we're not gonna do this right now.
Listen to me.
You robbed me of five years of my son's life.
What gave you the right to do that?
I'm decorating, and I'm seeing pictures of him All over the place, and that's all I'm ever gonna see of him At this age. -
That's right.
Well, you should have called me back
Because I called you three times, four times,
And you never called me back.
What was I supposed to do?
- You know, leave me a-
- - leave a message
On your answering machine?
"Hey, Crosby, it's Jasmine.
I'm pregnant. Call me back."
Yeah, anything would have been better than what you did.
You know what, after the third call,
I realized I didn't want you to call back.
I had this big, serious thing to do--
Have a baby and raise that baby,
And what I didn't need
Was some flaky guy in the picture.
Hey, it's my son.
You don't get to just make those decisions.
What do you mean I don't get--
That's my son too.
I gave birth to him, okay?
All of a sudden, now you want to play daddy?
What kind of father takes his son on a play date
And leaves them with a stranger in a pool?
It's not a stranger.
It was a lifeguard.
Yeah.
This is his party. I'm his dad.
My family is his family.
I want his cousins and his aunts and his uncles here.
They have a right to be here.
Hey. I'm talking to you.
Okay. Um...
You--you need to know that, um, my family Isn't exactly inclined towards you.
What does that mean?
Well, my father abandoned us, and they think you're--
You did just, like, the same thing.
Yeah, I didn't know that I had a kid.
How is that similar?
They don't know that.
Wait, they think that
I knew about Jabbar
And that I just blew him off?
It didn't seem to matter.
I didn't think you'd ever be back in his life again.
I'm sorry.
Just invite everyone.
Have 'em all come.
We'll manage.
I have to admit I like when you screw up, kinda.
It makes me feel like we're a little bit more...
Okay.
No, no, hey, hold up.
What are you doing? This is on me.
Dad, I can pay for my own room.
Two rooms? Come on.
That's crazy.
Uh, two double beds?
You have lovely eyes, by the way.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
Manisha.
Manisha. Can you say that?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Ice road truckers. Come on.
Hey, dad, can we just pause with the tv for a second?
I just want you to tell me what's going on.
What do you mean?
With this property.
You know, that place, it's not a great investment.
I wish I thought it was.
And you're a great salesman, but I don't think
You believe it is either.
Long-term it is.
All right, well, then, hold on to it.
I can't, Sonny.
Why not?
You're my firstborn son.
I never wanted to go to you for anything.
I give to you.
Especially now, I mean, with Max.
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.
I saw this opportunity.
I mean, how the hell was I supposed to know
There was gonna be a bubble?
I had to take a second out on the house
So I could grab it, and then all hell broke loose.
Pops.
Well, I mean, the country's in the toilet.
It's not just me.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Look, you have great instincts.
It's just--like you said, it's just timing like you said.
You know? - Yeah.
Bad timing.
Okay, now, lookit.
Now listen here.
Do you think there's any chance at all
With your company?
Dad, I said I will talk to them.
I will talk to them.
And you show 'em the pictures,
And you tell 'em that it's...
Both: Raw space.
I got it. Raw space.
That's all I can do.
What does this mean?
Does this mean you might lose the house?
I mean, do you need to talk to my accountant?
I have an accountant, Adam.
I'm just trying to help.
Yeah, I know. It's serious.
I mean, would we be here
If it wasn't serious? Come on.
Serious.
Does anybody else know about this?
Have you told mom?
Oh, I can't tell her this.
- You have to tell-
- you can't keep this from her.
Look, I will talk to Gordon.
Okay? - Yeah.
But you have to tell mom.
Okay.
- Want to see my room?
- Sandwich?
Would you like a sandwich? No?
Sandwich? No?
Watching your figure?
Hey, Crosby. I'd like you to meet some people.
This is my brother sekou.
Oh, great.
- And this is my-
- my mother Renee.
- Hi.
- Yes.
Mom, this is Crosby.
So nice to meet you.
Well, so nice to meet you, Crosby.
Sheila, could you help me?
Yeah, um...
- Hi.
- Hello.
Who are all these white people?
The cirque du soleil?
We did see one of those, but--
It's a houseboat.
There's actually a bedroom and a living room
And a kitchen.
It's pretty comfortable.
Well, that's an interesting choice.
Sekou.
That's a beautiful name.
Thank you.
You named him after sekou tarunga,
The African independence leader, I assume.
Now how did you know that?
Berkeley in the '60s, babe.
Oh, I hear that.
You know what,
I'm sorry, this is weird.
I know you're trying and all that stuff,
But where have you been, dude?
Um, I wish I had been here.
Yeah, that's your loss.
Yeah. No one knows that more than me.
You know, I'm just glad I get to be in his life now
And hopefully be a role model.
He has a role model, Crosby.
I've been here since the day he was born.
- Sekou.
- No, I'm just telling him how it was.
I drove him back from the hospital.
I stood at his christening. Huh?
Look, I moved apartments just to be closer to him.
I'm gonna go get the cake.
Sekou, would you help me?
No, I'm telling him how it was, mom.
I would like to say something if I may.
- Dad.
- Are there any more
Of those little corn muffins?
You seem to have a wonderful family.
I've met you, and I like you all,
But why are you treating my son
Like he's a pariah?
The only reason I can think of
Is because he's white. - Dad!
Grandpa, no one--
We think he has Tourette's.
He didn't mean that the way that it sounds.
Stating the obvious.
You know, maybe it's because he's irresponsible.
Renee, that is not my understanding.
Well, there's a five-year-old little boy here
That he hasn't seen for five years.
Um, Zeek, I think I understand
What you're trying to say.
Everyone here is upset with Crosby
Because they feel that he abandoned Jabbar and me.
But he didn't.
What?
I never told him
About his son.
- You what?
- Wow.
Uh, it was just, um, easier For me to lie to all of you
And let you believe that he was just like dad.
Easier for who, you or Jabbar?
Look, um, you know,
I was the one
That chose to have this baby
And not let his father know.
It was me. It was me.
And I'm sorry.
But if you're gonna be mad at anyone,
Just be mad at me.
Don't be mad at him.
Is it time for cake?
Oh, buddy, is it ever.
Yeah, let's eat cake now.
Maybe grandpa Zeek can help us cut the cake.
I'm on top of it,
Renee, I must say.
Is this too much mayonnaise still?
- No.
- Never too much.
Excuse me, by the way, why wasn't Amber there today?
- Um, she...
- She was studying.
Oh, well, I think she should have been there.
Sorry. Yeah.
Did you talk to mom yet?
Hey, Sonny, I told you
I would talk to her. - Okay.
- Kristina.
- Hey.
Um, I'm returning this.
I read it three times.
- You did?
- I did.
I did. - Was it helpful?
- Yeah.
- It's helpful, right?
I had no idea what you guys were facing.
- Well.
- I wanted you to know also,
Just, Joel and I both, we were so moved
By the way that you reached out,
And thank you for that, so... - Oh, my gosh.
Are you kidding me?
You would do the same.
It's fine. - Yeah. Thank you.
How is Sydney? Is she good?
She's good, yeah.
We--we got the test results, and he said that
Her trouble's stemming from boredom in school,
And she tested gifted.
Gifted.
That's great.
That's--what am I- that's really great.
That's amazing. - Yeah.
I was embarrassed to tell you that.
- Julia, no.
- I'm sorry.
- That is amazing.
- Thanks.
That's wonderful.
I'm happy for you and her.
That's great.
Hey, I'm going out.
So I'll see you later, okay?
Good night.
Bye, honey.
We missed ya at the party.
- How was it?
- It was fun.
It was good.
I saved you a piece of cake.
That's nice. Thanks.
I'll have it when I get back.
Oh, no, take it with you.
It's a paper plate.
That's okay.
I'll have it when I get back.
Why won't you take the cake?
I don't want to take the cake.
I'm done trying to control you.
I--it doesn't work.
You know, I'm fine.
Are you?
Sometimes I'm not sure.
I just don't want us to be like this.
I love you so much.
I think I'll just...
Try to get along with you
And...
Trust you.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm meeting Damien.
He's picking me up.
Okay.
See you later. - See you later.
You look like a little baby.
It's all over your face.
So, like, the other day,
I got a "C"
On this test that I was, like, sure that I had aced.
- A "C"?
- It was so weird.
Well, I guess a "C"'s better than a "D,"
And you've had plenty of those, right?
Yeah, I guess.
You know, you could ace whatever you want,
But that stuff doesn't really mean anything.
I mean, after the electrical grid fails,
I mean, who's gonna survive?
Someone who gets an "A" On a test
Or someone who's been in the school of life?
It's all coming down, the whole world as we know it.
Really? That's what you think?
Yeah. I mean, I don't know when.
But I do know that what you get on a report card
Is gonna seem pretty insignificant
When you're living off the land
And fending off "Marooders."
What did you say?
Marooders.
But you know it's marauders.
Marooders.
Mm. Marauders.
No one says that. - Mm, marauders.
- Okay?
- Marauders.
Eat this.
You didn't tell me about your trip.
How'd it go?
Well, it was great.
Was our number one son helpful?
Now, I will tell you something, that kid Adam
Has got a great head for business.
Oh, you can settle an argument we were having.
Now we were talking about trips going to the grand canyon...
Was it Adam or Crosby
That vomited on your head?
It was Sarah.
Boy, you really don't remember, do you?
Well, I mean, there was so much going on.
You know, there's been quite a background of information.
I can't keep track of all of it.
Well, maybe that was because the vomit wasn't dripping
Down your face.
You were too busy laughing.
Oh, you got to admit it was funny.
This is the way it went.
Julia got sick
And threw up in my hair.
She was screaming her little heart out.
And I was trying to comfort her
While wiping puke out of my eyes.
You were too busy laughing to even think about helping.
You did me the big favor of pulling into a gas station.
While you were filling up the tank,
I was in that...
Blech, disgusting bathroom trying to wash the vomit
Out of my hair under the faucet in the sink.
Millie, I never knew it upset you that much.
Would you accept a belated apology?
I'm sorry.
Ha. Sure.
So what else about the trip?
Anything?
Adam, he snores like a chainsaw,
But he's not going to admit it.
What else can I tell you?
- Is he asleep?
- Yeah. The eagle has landed.
Thank God. I'm exhausted.
Well... I found Sydney's ball
Beneath his pillow.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God, she gave it to him?
No. He stole it from her.U/
- He stole it from her?
- Uh-huh.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Okay, honey, we have to call Julia and Joel.
Call them. Where's the phone?
Call them and what?
Give it back?
- Yes.
- Oh, screw that.
- What?
- Look, if she's
Such a little genius, she can make, you know,
A thousand of 'em using cold fusion.
- Cold fusion?
- Yeah.
Honey, you have to tell him that this is not okay.
He can't just take things without asking.
- Well, I did tell him.
- Okay. Good. What did he say?
He said he asked her.
- And?
- And she said no.
- So he just stole it?
- Mm-hmm.
What's so funny?
- You are, buddy.
- Is that my rubber band ball?
- Huh?
- I couldn't find
The rubber band ball when you guys woke me up
With the laughing.
Why don't you come in here?
- Well, I asked her for it.
- You did?
You said I just had to ask.
No, I didn't.
You just said you can only have it if you ask her.
- But she has to say yes.
- You never said that.
What you reading about?
Water scavenger beetle.
Emerald click beetle.
What's your favorite beetle?
- Hercules beetle.
- Hercules beetle.
You know how much we love you, buddy?
Hmm? - As much as I love beetles.
What are you smiling about?
Your family is intense.
You think?
That's saying a lot, coming from me.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
I know that wasn't easy.
Yeah, well, I should have told 'em the truth
A long time ago, you know.
I think Jabbar had a good birthday party.
Yeah. Did you notice
That he had three pieces of cake?
Did you notice that he went into a weird little sugar coma
At one point on the third slice
With, like, drool coming down
Mixed with the blue dye? - Yes,
I noticed that.
He's very cute, our son.
I think I'm falling in love.
With Jabbar. - Oh.
- It's okay.
- Good.
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Yeah.
You look like you saw a ghost.
Good. I was worried for a second.
Why don't you...
Why don't you come join me in the living room?
Okay.
I told Damien to go back.
It had absolutely nothing to do with you.
I hope you're happy.

No. And neither will you.
I'm sure there's lots of stuff buried in these parts.
That doesn't mean that there's a Mr. Gordy.
I beg to differ.
Did you look at the deed to your house?
The previous owner?
Yeah, the bank owned it.
Before that. Check it out.
Straight from the county assessor.
Look at the name at the bottom.
The Gordy family owned all this land going back 200 years, and this J.S. Gordy was the last one.
Then the bank got it in the '70s.
Ask me how they got it.
Okay, you're gonna get one shot at this, all right?

I visit to see if they've found a church yet.
Because I happen to preside over one.
Oh.
Folks around here had been wondering when this rather special piece of property would sell.
Yeah? What's special about it?
Aside from it being overgrown as all hell?
Andy Wyrick.
Pastor Jordan Wells.
The property is special because back around the time of the Civil War, it was the Station Master's land.
But I'm sure you knew that.
What, like a rail road?
No tracks on this land.
No, it wasn't that kind of rail road.
Do you mean, like, the Underground Railroad?
The folks who helped escaped slaves make it up north? Wow.
That's right. Those people were known as station masters and one of the most well-known lived right here on your land.
He actually hid slaves on our property?
Yes, ma'am.
Hundreds of men, women and children passed right through here with nothing but the clothes on their back and the light of the moon to guide them.
They didn't have flashlights?
No, sweetie.
They couldn't even use lanterns.
The moonlight was the only light that they ever saw.
It was the light of freedom in the Promised Land.
The Station Master was an extraordinary man.
Entire generations of families would not exist if it was not for the Station Master and this piece of land.
So, don't be surprised if you get visitors from time to time.
Living ones, I hope.
- As opposed to?
- Andy's just having a little fun.
- I do that.
- Well, if you do get any visitors,
I hope you'll be more welcoming than the previous owner, J.S. Gordy, was.
He didn't exactly share his ancestor's hospitable nature.
Between you and me there was something seriously off about that man.

We were told we could come back here.
Yeah. Bullshit. By who?

Now help me sit on down.
I wanna visit with the little one.
Come on, little one.
Be all right, young man.
All right, you gonna tell me why you came all the way out here just to buy some ratty old quilt?
A long time ago, when this quilt was hung out here in these woods, it meant it was safe to approach.
Safe for who?
Mama Kay's ancestors for one. Mine too.
Do you even know where you're living at, Mr...
Andy.
Our pastor said we might get visitors.
Something about an Underground Railroad.
This was one of the stations.
Mama Kay's always wanted to visit this place.
The guy saved a lot of lives, I reckon.
And he deserved better than what happened to him.
You don't need eyes to see, little one.
But you already know that.
What do you mean?
You asked your father if he saw me.
Now, that makes you some kind of special.
My mama says I'm not supposed to talk about that.
But you have to be careful with a gift like that.

You remember Pastor Wells talking about the Station Master?
Well, back when he owned all this land,
he was what's called a taxidermist.
He also did something that he didn't tell anybody.
He would help hide people who were in trouble.
People like Mama Kay's great-aunt, Nell,
and her fiancé, Levi.
You see, Nell and Levi had fallen in love and had dreams of getting married once they were safe and free.
<font color="#808080">ANDY:</font> How the hell did people even find their way out here?
There were guides called conductors who helped them.
And these quilts, they were a code from the Station Master telling them where he'd meet them.
- Look here, you see this tree?
- Yeah.
There it is, down there. The meeting place.
The Station Master would come get them and take them to a hiding place somewhere on this property until it was safe to move on.
Well, some of the other land owners, they
found out what the Station Master had been doing.
Well, they didn't like it very much.
So they did some
very unkind things to him.
They hurt him just for helping people?
They didn't see it that way, sweetie.

<font color="#808080">MALE NEWS REPORTER:</font> Most Pine Mountain residents know the story of the Station Master
who helped slaves escape to freedom as part of the Underground Railroad.
But last night, a young local girl uncovered a sad, unknown chapter
in the saga right in her own backyard.
What authorities believe are the remains of five males...
<font color="#808080">FEMALE NEWS REPORTER:</font> 
...discovered in an underground chamber
beneath the ruins of the Station Master's cabin.
Now, the Station Master, also known as Jefferson Gordy
was the great-grandfather of the late J.S. Gordy,
who died in 1978.
<font color="#808080">MALE REPORTER:</font> For all the lives that were saved by the Underground Railroad
there were also many folks who didn't make it,
who just went missing.
And today's discovery is a tragic reminder of how dangerous it really was.
In this particular case, when the Station Master was murdered,
there was no one to let the slaves out, who were waiting below...
Will you please turn it off?
...and they probably starved to death down there.
Reporting live...
You think that's Mama Kay's family?
They said five males, so I doubt it.
Hey.
What are you doing up?
I don't want to live here anymore.
It's all right now, Heidi.
The things that we saw, they've moved on.
Their spirits aren't trapped anymore because of you.
Joyce, please. Spirits?
Don't you understand what's happened here, Lisa?
Those people in the chamber wanted to be found.
That's what this has all been about.
Now they're free, and there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
Mr. Gordy said it's not safe here.
You've seen Mr. Gordy tonight?
He said I shouldn't have gone down in that hole.
He said I let something bad come out.
Okay, it is time for you to go back to bed.
Heidi Wyrick, you follow me right now.
We can't be here anymore, Mama.
I went in the hole and the bad man saw me.
He knows we're here now and he's coming.
What bad man, sweetie?
The Station Master.
- I let him out, Mama.
- Well, Mr. Gordy is wrong, because you know very well that the Station Master was a good man.
No, he wasn't.
Andy, will you please tell her that there is nothing to be afraid of?
Mr. Gordy said there was money buried in the garden, Lisa, and there was.
He said that something terrible happened here. It did.
For something in Heidi's mind,
Mr. Gordy is sure as hell right a lot.
Are you telling me that suddenly you believe all this?
I believe there was a cave full of skeletons on our land, Lisa.
Is there a...
A "bad man" down there, too?

- Yeah, where you're not.
- Bogus ass.
Why you gotta do me like that?
Because she doesn't do losers, duh.
- Ah, l see.
- Yeah, she's not Kathy.
- Oh, shut up.
- All you girls are crazy as hell.
So what's going on with this weekend?
Party's on this weekend.
You can come by the crib around midnight.
- Shit'll be off the hook.
- Cool. Can l bring Aaron?
- Nope. No dudes.
- Why not?
Because it's my party and it's my rules, that's why.
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah, Kathy, you'd better obey the rules.
Oh, shut up. l have footage of you
''obeying the rules'' on your hands and knees at the last party.
Hey, Ben, can l bring Amy?
Man, this is a party, not church.
You're not really going to drag her along, are you?
Whoa, y'all need to chill.
What's wrong with Amy?
Oh well, let's think.
She's a drag.
She ain't fun for shit.
She don't know how to dress.
Amy is hot.
Man, if Amy was hot,
Lexie would have fucked her by now.
Shut up!
No, we all know you go with the flow.
Look, Ben, l'm serious.
Her birthday's coming up.
Oh. Well, she's going to get an ass-whupping if she comes to my party.
Well, either Amy comes or l don't.
- We gotta go, Meg.
- Okay, bye.
See you later.
What is it with you and this girl?
You fuckin' her?
She got blackmail on you? What?
She's my friend.
She's not a fucking loser like the rest of you.
Yeah well, l got a reputation to think about. l run the best parties and you are my premier party girl.
You bringing Amy along could take away that crown.
Well, maybe l don't need to have it.
Yeah, you do.
What the fuck else do you got?
Does Amy come or do l spend quality time with my mom Saturday night?
- You owe me for this.
- Yeah, take a number. l'm not kidding.
You're going to be jumping hoops if you want to bring Miss Party Killer.
You just make sure you take a fucking bath.
Oh, here they are.
Come on, sweetheart.
Give me $10.
That's right.
You enjoy your time in there.

You're all jacked up.
Oh, man.
Boy:
Okay okay.
Motherfucker.
Close the door, man.
Close the door.
Ahh!
Boy: Hey, Lexie, why don't you do something sexy or something?
Like what?
Boy:
Make out or something.
Oh yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
We don't make out for hired help.
Well, fuckin' do something.
Jesus.
All right, watch this.
Boy:
Oh, man. Aw shit.
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?
- Lexie: Oh my God!
- ( laughter )
- Boy: Oh God.
- Lexie: Fuck you!
- Boy: She's wasted.
- Boy #2 : She is wasted.
- Hey, Meg.
- Hey. Are you okay?
- l'm so stupid.
- No, you're not. lt was my fault. l shouldn't have brought you there.
- Now all your friends hate me.
- So what?
Fuck them.
They're just shit.
- l'm such a loser.
- No, you're not. l'm like nothing.
No, l want you to shut up about that. l don't know why you're friends with me.
Well, because l am, that's why.
Look, l'm the big fucking loser. l was the one blowing some dickhead for a hit.
That did look kind of gross.
- Yeah, it tasted gross.
- Ew. l don't think l could ever do that.
- l'd be way too embarrassed.
- Why? lt's like a power thing.
You're in charge.
Oh, you really looked like you were in charge.
No, l'm serious.
Like, the guy can't come unless you let him. l don't know.
Well, you know, someday you're going to do it. l'll probably screw that up too.
- Well, just practice before.
- Practice?
- Yeah.
- Like how?
Like on anything.
Like a banana.
Try not to leave teeth marks.
Was that how you learned?
- No.
- Tell me. l was at summer camp when l was 10.
You were 10 when you did it?
Do you want to listen to this or not?
So l was at summer camp and there was this counselor.
He was older, like 17.
He was always telling me that l was pretty and shit.
So one day he tells me to come to the pantry to like help him get paper plates.
And it's really small in there, so we're like pressed up against each other.
- Was he really hot?
- He was okay.
He looked kind of like that guy in the movie ''Se7 en.''
- Brad Pitt?
- No, the weird killer guy.
Oh. Ew.
Okay, anyways, so he's pressed up against me and l can feel it and it's like huge.
And then he just looks at me and pushes-- he puts his hand on top of my head and pushes me down to my knees
- in front of him.
- Did you scream?
No, he was really gentle.
And then he unzips his jeans and just takes it out.
- And l was like, ''Whoa.''
- What was it like? lt was like this big fat snake like staring me in the face.
- Oh my God.
- And he's like waving it around and tapping it on my nose and shit.
And he puts it against my lips. l'm like, l don't know what to do, but there's like nowhere to go, you know?
And he just keeps pushing, and l think at some point l opened my mouth to say something like,
''Get that smelly thing out of my face,'' and he just shoved it in.
- Did you choke?
- Yeah, because it was huge.
My mouth was wide open like this. Like--
Oh wow.
And l was starting to turn blue because l couldn't breathe.
And he tells me to breathe through my nose and l do.
And snot starts coming out of my nose.
- Oh my God.
- But it wasn't funny. l was like blowing my nose all over his dick.
And he's like pumping it in and out, back and forth in my mouth and grabbing my hair.
Did you-- oh my God.
- Did you scream?
- No.
He told me a couple of times actually to get my teeth out of the way, but like where the fuck were they supposed to go?
- You know?
- Yeah. l mean like there wasn't any room in there for his dick and my teeth.
Oh.
So he just keeps pumping and grabbing my hair.
And at some point l look up and l can see that he's going to come, because, you know, guys look really stupid before they come.
Mm-hmm.
Like how?
Like, their faces get all scrunchy and they look like they're taking a shit or something.
Oh my God.
So he's doing all this weird shit with his face.
Mm-hmm.
And all of a sudden there's like this explosion in my mouth and all this hot gooey stuff starts coming out.
- Did you swallow any of it?
- Yeah. l swallowed a lot of it because l didn't have a choice. l mean there was like a gallon of it and it just kept coming.
And he's like grabbing my head so l couldn't move or anything, right?
And like l started coughing and it just started coming out of my nose and the sides of my mouth, like probably my ears.
- Oh. Did it taste totally gross?
- lt was like--
- Mom, what the fuck?
- Who are you talking to? lt's Amy. l was talking to Amy.
Jesus Christ. lt's me, Miss Stewart.
Sorry. lt's late.
Go to sleep, Megan.
Sorry, Meg.
Sorry. l-- l hate it here. l hate it so much. l have to get out of here.
Where would you go? l don't care.
Well, if you go anywhere, l'm going with you.
- Really?
- Yeah. You're my best friend.
Really? l don't know what l'd do without you.
Well, you're my best friend too, Amy.
- Really?
- You're my only real friend.
Miss Stewart:
Megan, go to sleep now!
Maybe we'll run away together, go far away somewhere like Texas or something.
Why Texas? l don't know.
Sounds far away.
Okay. Texas.
Texas.
- Good night, Amy.
- Good night, Meg.
Tada! And here we are, the stars of the hour on Amy's new video camera.
My expensive new video camera.
Daddy loves me.
Yeah, well, mine love me too, slut.
Bitch.
- Okay okay, what should we do?
- l don't know.
We can make a documentary about my cat, like ''A Day in the Life of Charlie'' or something.
- Are you for real?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, let's do something, you know, like not boring.
Ooh, l know.
Why don't you strip? l'm not doing that.
Oh yeah, that's right.
We said not boring.
Shut up.
You strip then.
- Fine, l will.
- No no no no no.
What if my parents see this by accident?
Well, your dad's pretty hot. l so did not hear that.
Okay, why don't we do an interview, like your life's story?
- Okay.
- Okay, you go first.
Okay.
Okay, start with your name and birthday.
Hello. My name is Megan Stewart and l was born on August 1 2th, 1992. l go to Alton High School where l am an honor student. l am a Leo which means l'm generous and warm-hearted-- do you want to not laugh, bitch? l am also faithful and loving and creative and broad-minded.
Well, then l say that last part's true.
Okay, so what else?
Um, l live with my mom who loves me very much. l am her pride and joy.
My dad-- my real dad-- is somewhere-- l don't know, l don't know-- doing something.
My stepfather's name is Paul.
He's in prison.
He fucked me for the first time when l was nine.
And he kept on fucking me for two years.
My mom was so afraid of losing him that she wouldn't-- she wouldn't even listen to me when l told her about it.
She even blamed me when he got sent to prison.
Guys like me.
They've always liked me. l'm... a likable girl, l guess. l'll pretty much do what you want, but you have to tell me that you love me.
They're all so fucking pathetic.
- ( computer chimes )
- Hey.
- What the hell is that?
- lt's my stuffed animal.
- lt's cute.
- Oh, it's adorable.
Yeah, l know.
- So are you going to go tonight?
- l don't know.
There's never anything but losers there.
Yeah well, l've met some pretty cool guys there like Jorge.
Okay, l hate to break it to you, but Jorge's not cool.
Whatever.
He's fun to hang out with.
- No.
- And so are you. l mean, maybe sometime you want to hang out again?
Um, Lex, l'm just not like comfortable with what happened before.
- Yeah, no. lt's okay.
- lt's just not me, you know?
No, l understand.
That's fine.
Um, actually l've been talking to this new guy named Josh.
- He's really cool.
- Oh yeah? What makes him cool?
He skateboards and he goes to Tolland
- and he competes for real stuff.
- Oh really?
And he saw that l like skateboarding and so he added me.
- You don't skateboard.
- Whatever.
Guys dig it when chicks are skateboarders.
Lex! Oh my God.
Oh, you should check it out. lt's Skaterdude.
- Okay.
- ( keyboard clicking )
Doesn't he look like Brad Pitt?
A little in the eyes, l guess.
Does Josh have a cam?
He does, but his little brother like busted it or something crazy, so... l don't know.
But-- ooh, one time he met
George Clooney in person.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah.
Oh my God.
And he like talked to him for like an hour at this mall and--
- What mall?
- l don't know.
We should like go and stalk him or something.
Yeah. That's funny.
- But you should talk to him.
- Okay, maybe.
Maybe if l'm bored l'll go. l don't know.
Okay. Well then, l'll talk to you later.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Bye.
Hello, my name's Amy Herman and today's January 1 3th, 2007, and this is my video diary.
This is my room.
As you can see, it's very neat and clean, because l believe cleanliness is next to godliness.
This is Mr. Rupert.
He's in charge of all the rest of the animals and he makes sure that they all behave when l'm gone. l love him, but he's not my favorite bear.
My favorite bear is Billy Bear.
He's not here anymore.
This is my best friend Megan.
We go on all kinds of crazy adventures.
We're pretty wild together.
We're like sisters. l just love her.
As you can see, l live in a pretty nice house.
We live in an area called Sherman Oaks. lf you're not from Los Angeles, you have no idea what l'm talking about.
But there it is.
- This is my mom Louise.
- Amy, what are you doing? lt's my video diary.
You want to tape me rushing around, trying to get dinner ready?
Sure. lt's real life.
So is doing your homework while l'm doing this.
Mom's a real estate agent as well as being a mom.
She's probably crabby because she didn't sell a house today.
- Amy.
- ( laughs )
This is my cat Charlie.
He's really old.
He's actually older than me, which makes him like 100 in cat years.
That's really old.
This is my backyard.
This is our barbecue.
When the weather's nice, we'll barbecue and my parents will invite some friends over for a party.
My dad's not here.
He works long hours, but he always makes sure to be here on my birthday and other important holidays.
Well, that's my house.
Thanks for joining me on the tour.
Bye.
- Josh: Hello, hot chick.
- Hi, Skaterdude.
- ( laughs ) My name's Josh.
- l know.
How did you know that?
My friend Lexie gave me your address.
Well, that was nice of her.
- So what's your name?
- Megan.
Nice name. l'm just checking your profile.
So you go to Tolland?
Yeah, when l go to school at all.
The teachers suck there.
They do at Alton too.
Oh, Alton.
So we live near each other.
- Yeah.
- Hmm.
You should come skateboarding sometime. l don't board. l'll watch.
Where do you board?
Usually down by the ravine in the back of the diner.
- You know where that is?
- Yeah.
Yeah, l'm around there all the time.
Cool.
Hey, can you tilt your webcam down a little?
Why? l don't know.
Just because.
Oh my God, all guys are the same.
What? l'm not putting on a show for you, freak.
- No! l didn't mean it like that.
- Then what? l don't know. l'm-- nothing. l'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
- How's that?
- Mm, much better.
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.
So your cam is broken, huh?
Yeah, my fucking dog chomped on it. l thought your little brother broke it.
Yeah, he did, and then my dog took a swipe at it too.
Wow, sucks to be you.
Damn, you're a firecracker.
That's right.
Gotta watch myself around you, huh?
Uh-huh.
Ah... l like that.
Too many girls just roll over-- like no challenge.
You know a lot of girls, huh?
No. l'm into quality, not quantity.
Yeah, l'm sure. l've heard that one before. l'm serious.
No bullshit.
Yeah well, maybe.
- Maybe what?
- Just maybe.
So you going to the party tonight?
- l don't know.
- Hmm.
At least you get to see what l look like. l already know what you look like.
How? l have an imagination.
Oh no.
Lexie gave you my picture, didn't she?
- Maybe.
- Oh my God, busted!
You're such a stalker. l am not! l just-- never mind.
Ah. No, that's cool. l like knowing some chick thinks l'm dope. l didn't say l thought you were dope.
Maybe a dope.
Oh my God.
You've got a mouth on you, a nice one too.
- You think so?
- Mm, hell yeah.
Aw.
Now you're torturing Skaterdude.
- ( laughs )
- Aw, poor baby.
You're a cool chick.
You should come tonight.
We should hook up.
Maybe.
Come on, l'll be hanging with my buds by the kitchen.
- You gonna come?
- Maybe.
Mm, okay, Maybe Megan.
- Well, l hope to see you tonight.
- Okay.
- All right. Bye, hot chick.
- Bye.
- ( beeps )
- Hey.
Where are you going?
Um, l decided at the last minute to go to Tracy's party.
Oh, l thought you weren't going to go.
Yeah, it's just l was talking to this kind of cool guy and he's going to be there, so l thought l'd check him out.
Oh, okay.
So, yeah. l'll call you tomorrow?
Yeah, l'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, video diary. lt's me, Amy, again.
Yeah, like who else would it be? l was going through some magazines the other day because l want to find a nice dress for my prom.
My prom's not for four years away, but l figured if-- if someone asked me to his, then l should be prepared.
Hell, like who's going to ask me, right?
Fuck you.
- ( beeps )
- Yeah?
Hey.
Amy? What time is it?
- ln the morning?
- Jesus Christ, Amy.
- Sorry. l was just wondering how it went with that guy.
- Was he cool?
- He wasn't there, fucking dork.
- l looked for him for four hours.
- That's too bad.
- What was his name?
- Josh, Josh the jerk.
Okay, well, what are you doing later?
- Sleeping.
- After that?
That's it.
Well, let's go to a movie or something.
- Okay, call me later.
- Okay. Good night.
Bye.
- ( computer chimes )
- Josh: Hey, hot chick.
How would you know?
Uh-oh, you sound pissed.
Oh no, why would l be pissed?
Just because some jerk tells me to meet him at a party and then never shows up?
Why would l be pissed?
- l was there.
- No, you weren't. l was at that party for four hours, buddy. lf you were there, then you're the invisible man. l looked like an idiot.
Well, l thought you looked great.
- And how would you know?
- Because l was there.
Okay. lf you were there, then what was l wearing?
Uh, well, you had on a really sexy little jean skirt and a black top with gold trim and, um, black high-heeled kind of sandals.
And l think you had a butterfly clip in your hair.
- You were there.
- Yeah, l told you.
Well, then why didn't you come up to me? l saw you looking around. l figured you were probably looking for me.
Yeah, l was.
And you looked so great. l mean you looked incredible. l totally felt my heart skip a beat when l saw you. l guess l just wimped out.
So you watched me?
Yeah. Kind of creepy, huh?
No. lt's kind of nice.
Yeah, l saw you talking with your friends.
You're really popular. l didn't want to barge in and mess things up.
- You're shy.
- Mm, sometimes. lt's okay. l get shy too sometimes.
Hmm. You seem like you're always in control.
No. Sometimes l just don't know what to do, so l usually do something stupid.
Hey well, Stupid is my middle name.
Anyway, l am sorry l didn't talk to you last night. lt's okay. l understand.
- You do?
- Yeah.
But l do wish l could have met you.
Yeah. Well, there were just so many people and stuff and it was like l didn't know that many people
- and l felt weird and--
- Yeah. Yeah, l understand.
So anyway, what are you doing today?
Oh, nothing much.
Me and my friend Amy are going to go see the new Matt Damon movie.
Matt Damon.
You like Matt Damon, huh?
Yeah. What's not to like? l don't know.
He looks kind of gay to me.
- l don't think so.
- Hmm.
- Well, l bet he can't skateboard.
- You're jealous.
Of him? Nah.
Yes, you are!
Admit it!
Why would l be jealous of Matt Damon? l don't know.
You tell me.
Well, maybe because he gets to spend time with you today and l don't.
Well, you could if you ask me.
Okay, then l'm asking you.
- Asking me what?
- ( laughing )
Wow, you don't make this easy, do you?
- Hey, l'm worth fighting for.
- ( chuckles ) Yeah, you are.
Thank you.
So, Megan, after your date with Matt Damon, would you like to meet up and maybe get some ice cream or something?
Yes, l would.
Cool.
Well, that was easy.
The movie will be over around like 7:00.
So do you want to meet us at the theater?
Uh, you know, l'd love to meet your friend and everything--
Yeah yeah, it's okay.
Um, why don't you web me later around like 7:30?
Okay, that sounds good.
- Okay. Bye, Josh.
- Bye.
- ( beeps )
- Hey.
Hey. Guess who l was just talking to.
- Lexie?
- No. Josh.
Josh, as in Josh the big fat jerk who stood you up Josh?
No no, he's not a jerk.
He was just shy.
- For four hours?
- Okay, so he's very shy.
But listen, l was just talking to him and he's really sensitive.
What did he say?
Well, we were talking about lots of stuff and, get this, he remembered everything l was wearing last night.
Wow. So what are you going to do? l'm going to see him tonight after the movie.
He's going to web me later.
Hey, you want to come over and say hello?
Um, if you don't think that's going to be weird.
Um, no.
He's really cool about stuff.
Yeah.
Oh, there you are.
Hey.
Okay, there he is.
Okay, be cool.
- ( computer chimes )
- Hello?
Josh: Hey, Megan.
How was the movie?
- Oh, it was okay.
- Hey, who's that?
- Hey, l'm Megan's best friend Amy.
- Hi, Amy. l think l might have seen you around school before.
- l thought you go to Tolland.
- Yeah, l do, when l go to school.
But sometimes l just like to hang out at Alton because the girls are prettier.
- And don't you forget it.
- ( Josh chuckles )
So what do you look like?
Oh, Megan didn't show you my pic?
- l don't remember if she did.
- Yes, you do, bitch!
- Don't listen to her, Josh.
- That's okay. l-- l have another one here l was going to send you anyway since my web's broken.
Here it comes.
Hold on.
- Oh, you didn't tell me you surf.
- Yeah, totally.
The waves are awesome this time of year because of the currents coming up from Mexico.
- Does it get cold?
- Nah, l wear a wetsuit.
And also the adrenaline keeps you warm.
- That sounds really cool.
- Yeah.
So are you two doing something tonight?
Oh, no.
Actually Amy was just leaving.
Bye, Amy.
See you in school tomorrow.
Bye. l saw that, Amy.
So, alone at last.
So you still want to meet up and do something?
- Sure. Where?
- l don't know.
Why don't we meet behind the diner in like 20 minutes?
- Behind the diner-- how romantic.
- ( laughs )
Well, if you want to meet somewhere else--
No, l'm kidding. l'm sorry. l can be kind of a smart-ass sometimes.
Ah, no problemo. l know how to deal with smart-asses.
- Oh? And how is that?
- You'll see.
See? lt's always the quiet ones you have to worry about.
- l would never hurt you, Megan.
- l know.
- Do you?
- Yes.
- Do you trust me?
- Yes. l trust you too.
So see you in like 20 minutes.
- Okay. Bye, Josh.
- Cool. Bye.
- ( beeps )
- Hello?
- Hey, Kathy, it's Amy.
- l know.
What l don't know is why you're calling me. l was just wondering if you talked to Megan today.
No, l haven't.
Um, l'm kind of busy, so l'm going to go, okay?
- Bye.
- ( beeps )
- ( beeps )
- Hello?
- Hey, Lexie.
- Hi.
Are you sure you didn't dial the wrong number? l know you don't like me, but l was just wondering if you saw Megan in history class today.
Huh-uh.
Well, l-- l gotta go.
- But--
- Bye.
- ( computer chimes )
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey. Who's this?
- lt's Amy. l met you yesterday. l'm Megan's best friend.
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.
How's it going?
Not so good.
Have you heard from Megan at all?
No, l was going to ask you the same thing.
We were supposed to get together last night and she never showed up.
She hasn't been at school all day.
She hasn't called me at all.
Mm, well, l haven't seen her. l mean do you guys talk all the time?
Yeah, like every hour.
This is so weird.
You know, maybe she went somewhere with her mom.
No, Megan and her mom don't get along. l don't know, Amy. l mean we talked and l thought we got along great.
- And then she never showed up.
- Okay.
Well, if you hear from her, will you web me?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Josh.
- Bye.
- Bye.

- News anchor: ln America a child disappears every 40 seconds.
The police need your help to solve these crimes.
Over 2,000 times a day somewhere a mother cries out:
Tonight on ''Missing'': a beautiful teenage girl, a desperate mother...
She's a good girl.
Just don't hurt her.
News anchor:
...and a mysterious disappearance. l don't know. One day she just didn't show up for school. ls she a runaway or is she the victim of foul play?
No matter which way you look at the facts, one fact remains:
Good evening. l'm Callie Daniels.
Megan Stewart, a beautiful popular 14-year-old girl vanished without a trace after going out with friends two days ago.
Police have no leads in the baffling disappearance of one of Alton High School's most popular students.
Megan Stewart is by all accounts one of the shining stars of Alton High School-- a straight-A student who devotes her spare time to helping her community and her friends.
She's popular with students and faculty alike.
Megan Stewart is a role model for many of our students here.
She's active in her community and a very good student.
Megan's mother, Joyce Stewart, gave this statement. l-- l just want her to be brought back safe to the people who love her and miss her.
We asked her friends if they thought Megan ran away.
- Megan would never run away.
- No. She's like my best friend.
And if something was wrong in her life, she would tell us.
She would totally.
Whether a runaway, abduction or other form of foul play, the one fact remains that this beautiful young girl disappeared without a trace.
Police are asking for your help.
Megan Stewart is 5'1'',
105 lbs with dark hair and hazel eyes.
She was last seen wearing blue jeans and a maroon blouse. lf you know anything regarding the whereabouts of this young girl, please contact
North Hollywood Police or you can send anonymous tips to findmegan.com.
Police are also looking for clues in the disappearance of 1 3-year-old Tercel Jackson who was abducted from his home in Crenshaw yesterday afternoon.
Anyone with information is encouraged to call the Crenshaw Police Department.
We will be right back with more on the disappearance and search for Megan Stewart after these messages. lt's been four days since l've heard from Megan. l don't think she ran away.
That's what all the news people are saying. l don't know what happened, but l'm worried.
This is so weird. l keep expecting her to call me any second. l sleep with my cell phone next to my pillow. l know she's alive. l can feel it.
A stunning break in the case of missing teenager Megan Stewart.
Police today released security camera footage from the back of a diner just one mile from where she lived.
The footage clearly shows that she encounters a man who appears to lead her away.
Sergeant Jon Simonelli of District 33 Police Department had this statement.
Well, we got a lucky break in the case.
We obtained some surveillance footage.
And on the videotape it appears as if she's waiting for someone.
Whether the man she walked away with was the individual she was waiting for
- is still under investigation.
- So you think she may be a runaway.
Well, we're looking at all possibilities at the moment.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the North Hollywood
Police Department.
And when we return, a pure-bred cocker spaniel accidentally drives his owner's car through a store window.
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, cute girl.
Don't say that. l wouldn't say it if it weren't true.
You don't think you're cute?
- l do.
- l'm all right.
Mm, l think you're sexy. l think you're one sexy girl.
Was that you in the video?
What, that security video?
That was some old dude.
- So you didn't see her there?
- No. l think maybe she skipped out with that guy before l got there.
You know, she seems kind of flaky.
She wouldn't do that.
She would have told me.
So you two are really close, huh?
Yeah, we are. lt's funny, you don't seem like the kind of girl she would hang with.
- What do you mean?
- You know what l mean.
Just look at yourself.
You know exactly what l mean.
No, l don't.
You just said l was sexy.
Then you're stupid too.
You'll believe anything, won't you? l think you know where she is.
Trying to change the conversation won't change the facts, Amy.
What facts?
That you're fat, that you have no friends, that no one finds you attractive.
- l have friends.
- ( laughs )
You have one friend who left and didn't tell you where she was going because she didn't want you tagging along.
No, that's not true.
Would you like to have friends, Amy?
Would you like to sleep with something besides your teddy bear?
- Shut up.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you hug your teddy bear, Amy, and pretend he's some guy you like
- who's never going to talk to you?
- Shut up.
Because you're some loser who won't spread her legs?
You don't know anything about me.
You don't know who l am. l know exactly who you are, Amy.
Megan told me all about you-- how pathetic you are, how you follow her around like a little puppy.
You're like a big joke to her.
- What did you do to Megan?
- Nothing.
Nothing she didn't do with 100 guys before.
Today on ''Missing,'' new revelations in the case of Megan Stewart, the North Hollywood teenager who disappeared over two weeks ago.
Police were given a statement by 14-year-old Amy Herman, a close friend of the missing girl.
Reporter:
What did you tell the police? l just told them about someone
Megan was chatting with online.
- What's this person's name?
- Had she met with this man before? l'm sorry, but that information is vital to the ongoing investigation.
Well, now that you've come forward, do you fear for your own life?
All right, that's it.
No more questions for now.
We have confirmed that Amy Herman mentioned a man named Josh who apparently met Megan Stewart in a chat room using the nickname Skaterdude.
A complete chronology of the investigation can be found at our website: findmegan.com.
We'll be back after these messages.
Let me take you on a tour of some of the places
Megan and l would go to. l keep thinking l'll see her somewhere. l keep hoping l do, at least.
This is a diner.
We always used to come here after school.
- What are you doing?
- Get that camera out of my face. l'm not recording you guys. l'm making a video diary for myself.
About how you messed up
Megan's life, huh?
No--
You know it's because of you that she's not here, right?
That's not true.
What are you going to do, sell this?
Are you going to sell this to the news?
No, l'm-- l'm not going to sell this to anyone.
You know what?
Stay the fuck out of my face, bitch.
- As you can see l'm very well liked.
- Hey!
You know that this is all your fault, right?
You think you're hot shit because she spent every waking moment with you?
- No, l--
- ls that what you think? l don't think that.
Fuck.
She loved me!
And l-- l loved her back. l loved her so much!
And now she's gone because of you!
This is all your fault and l can't fix it.
There's nothing l can fucking do.
Get the fuck out of my face.
This is all your fault.
Amy: Megan and l used to come under this bridge and just talk about stuff. l remember one time when it just started to rain and then it started to pour.
All of a sudden the entire river was flooded.
We didn't want to tell anyone about it.
We thought people might think we were stupid. l guess we kind of were.
Megan's so adventurous.
She's not afraid to try things and she doesn't care what other people think about her. l wish l was more like her. l'm going to show you something.
This is Billy Bear. l've had him since l was like five.
Three years ago my mom wanted me to get rid of him because he was all ragged, but l just couldn't.
So l keep him here and l can visit him whenever l want.
People keep saying how this experience is supposed to help me grow up, but... l don't understand that. lf anything, it's making me not want to grow up.
There's so much weirdness out there. l'd just-- l'd just rather stay here with Billy.
Who is this?
- Josh: l think you know.
- Josh?
You have a big mouth. l didn't say you kidnapped Megan.
No. You just said you think l did.
Well, if you didn't, you have nothing to worry about. l don't have anything to worry about.
They can't find me.
You can set up free screen names anywhere.
What do you want from me? l want you to shut your big fucking mouth.
And if you still feel like yakking to the police, l may have to pay you a visit or your mom. l'm watching you, Amy.
Tonight a special
''Megan is Missing'' reenactment based on analysis of the original security camera footage.
We must warn you that some material may be too intense for younger viewers.
Well, we're filming the reenactment of an abduction and we're doing it actually on the exact location where the girl was abducted.
You want to find the truth and we believe an accurate reenactment in the same location might bring about some clues that the police really haven't been able to touch on themselves. l-- l just-- l think this is so important.
And l want to do anything l could do to help out. l mean l can't even imagine that this happened. lt is difficult playing someone as awful as this, but you look past your personal feelings and just try to make it real for the audience.
When l was a lot younger l spent a lot of time on the internet. lt's not a safe space.
As much as you feel safe in your own home, you're not safe.
And now a ''Megan is Missing'' exclusive reenactment.
Hey, Mom, it's me. l'm going to go to the store and get some groceries for breakfast.
So l'll see you soon. Bye.
You're trespassing.
Come with me.
Stop! No, please!
Please!
Stop! Stop!
The brutal abduction of a beautiful young girl.
We'll be right back. lt's been three weeks now. l can feel the people searching for Megan are starting to give up.
They're not trying anymore and it's really hard to get volunteers. l think that they might think she's dead.
Maybe l do too.
Tonight a shocking twist in the case of Megan Stewart.
The missing girl's best friend,
Amy Herman, has now vanished.
Are the girls the victims of the same kidnapper or have they simply run away together?
Detective Jon Simonelli had this to say.
Obviously the coincidence of both girls, who were friends, disappearing is enormous.
We're working all possible scenarios at this time.
A baffling case that grows more bizarre by the hour.
We'll be right back. lt has been two days since the disappearance of 15-year-old Amy Herman and 23 days since her best friend Megan Stewart was abducted behind a local diner.
Their friends have started a campaign to persuade everyone to tie pink ribbons on trees as a symbol of hope.
We're doing this pink ribbon campaign to let Megan know that we love her and we miss her.
And hopefully it'll make whoever took her, you know, feel bad and let her go.
Yvette: Search parties continue to examine the wooded area surrounding the two girls' homes for any leads as to their whereabouts.
Earlier today l spoke with Amy's parents.
We'd like to thank all the volunteers that have spent so many hours searching for Amy.
We believe in our hearts that she's well and that she will be returned to us.
Princess, if you can-- if you can hear me, we love you and we're praying for you.
Chief, we've got something here.
Frank, get the camera.
Get the camera, Frank.
Man: Tell those guys to stop.
Hold up. Hold up right there.

Someone, please help.
Amy: Help--
Josh, l don't know if you can hear me, but l love you, Josh. l love you.
Please don't do this to me. l love you.
We could love each other.
We could run away together.
Can't you see it? l'll be with you forever.
Please, you have to let me out of here... or we'll never have that chance.
Why?
Why are you doing this? l said l was sorry and l mean it. l-- l'm-- l'm really sorry.
Please, l don't want to die. l've got my whole life and you have your whole life.
Let me out.

Please open the top, please.
Please, just open it and l'll kiss you whenever you want.
What do you want me to do?
Josh, what do you want me to do? l'm so sorry. l'm so sorry for everything l did. l don't know what to tell you.
Can you hear me? l know you can hear me. l know you can. l'll be better. l'll be the best girlfriend you'll ever have, or the best wife or-- or anything that you want me to be. l'll be the best.
Please, just give me a chance. l promise you.

Just give me a chance.
Josh.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do? l'll prove it. l'll do anything-- anything in the whole world. l'll do anything. l'll never call my family again. l don't need Billy. l won't ever want him again. l won't ever ask for him. l'll eat anything you give me. l don't care.
Just open it once.
Please, just-- just open it once?
Amy: So l can show you how much l love you. l love you. l love you, Josh. l don't know if anyone else has ever told you that, but l mean it. l really do. l know we can love each other.

But l don't know how it goes.
How does it go?
Okay, it goes . Dad-- mommy shark, do do do, do do do .
- . Grandpa shark, do do do, do do do. .
- ( laughing )
- l don't know any other ones.
- And then the sharks eat you.
- No, the sharks don't eat you.
- Yeah, they do. l don't know who taught you, but you don't learn right.
- l don't learn right?
- Yeah.
- l learn just fine.
- Sure, you do. l learn differently than you do.
- Smelling your hair?
- Mm-hmm.
- ( laughing )
- My hair smells good.
What does it smell like?
What does it smell like in French?
- lt smells so good l can't even--
- What does it smell like in French?
- Like flowers.
- Ha!
Mm.
- You're crazy.
- You're crazy.
- Yeah, l guess we're both crazy.
- Mm.
So what do you want to be when you grow up? l am grown up, you dork.
You know what l mean-- in the future.
Uh, l say fuck the future.
What was that movie?
Where the guy said that to the other guy and--
Oh, yeah, and then the guy said...
Both:
''The future fucks you.''
- That was funny.
- Yeah.
So what do you want to be?
- l want to be you.
- You don't want to be me.
Yeah, l do.
That'd be so cool.
- Oh, you think so?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, then l would be you.
- No, you don't want to be me.
- That'd be boring beyond belief.
- Shut up. l'm serious. Boring.
Well, at least your mom and dad are around and they love you. l'm sure your mom loves you too. l think we're going to have amazing lives.
- Really?
- Yeah.
We're going to go to different countries and eat strange foods just like all those dorky
TV channels you watch.
- Documentary channels aren't dorky.
- Okay, if you say so.
- Shut up.
- ( laughs )
And we're going to meet guys with strange foreign accents, handsome dangerous guys who are like international spies or something.
- Amy: ln Venice, ltaly.
- Why Venice?
Well, it's more romantic than Texas.
- Fuck you!
- ( laughs ) lt was all l could think of at the time, okay?
- ( laughs )
- Meg?
Do you really think l'll meet someone...
- Yeah, you will.
- ...someday?
- Yeah.
- When? lt'll happen.
Don't rush it.
Well, you meet guys all the time.
Not the right ones.
How do you know what the right one is?
- He'll be honest.
- Mm-hmm.
He'll treat me like l'm special.
He'll be a little shy, but he'll be cool, so... l don't know. l'll just know.
We'll know when the right guy comes along.
- Okay.
- ( both chuckle )
- Shit.
Hey, Sully.
Baby, I just needed to rest my feet for, like, one second.
- Oh, so that's why you can't work right now?
You get paid to dance, not to sit on your ass drinking.
Now get to work!
- You can be a real asshole when you want to be.
- Stupid bitch.
Lock up the joint when you're done.
I'm going out.
- Hey, dude!
Get the fuck off of me!
Get your hands off!
- And then they beat them by, like, 65 points last year.
That wasn't even football game.
That was a basketball score.
- You know, he could have said USC.
He could have said a lot of other things.
Now he's going to the Aztecs.
Oh, my friend.
If I'd only gotten sober ten years ago.
Ahh!
- Our attention turns back to a story that we have been following for the past several days.
The greater Los Angeles area has been plagued with a rash of kidnappings with as many as four victims disappearing in separate attacks and all possibly by the same masked individual.
Now, a source inside the LAPD refuses to say whether or not there is a connection between the kidnapped victims.
- I'll take the check.
- A detective with the West Los Angeles division has also fallen prey to this masked criminal.
- You want to get out of the car?
Well, isn't that cute?
- Sorry, guys.
Gotta go. Gotta go.
Got an audition in the morning.
- Hey, I saw your commercial the other day, and you sucked, asshole.
- Hey, it's Kelley.
No, I don't know any more than the cops do.
Jackson got nabbed, and they think it might be linked to a priest who got nabbed in the valley on Thursday.
And then I got a report across my desk this morning about a kidnapping in Barstow, and they like Jackson's guy for that too.
I don't know.
I guess we got to pull over every green Chevy Malibu in the state and see if Jackson's locked in the trunk.
Yeah, I know that's not practical, but we got to do something.
I mean, who knows who's next on this guy's shit list?
- No.
No, no.
- You're dead.
- Ow.
- Do you have any idea who I am, you son of a bitch?
You're messing with the wrong woman.
Do you hear me?
- Much thanks.
- Ahh.
Dear Lord.
- You're never gonna get away with this.
- Let me out of here, or you're dead.
I'm gonna bust out of here.
I'm gonna bust your head.
And I'll take that gun and stick it up your ass.
- I brought the nine of you here today for a reason.
And your survival depends on you discovering what that reason is.
I'm gonna leave you alone for your discussions, but I'll return every ten minutes and kill one of you until you either figure it out or until you're all dead.
If you do manage to figure it out,
I'll free the survivors, notify the police of our location, and make a full confession to all the crimes
I will commit here today.
- Wait; I don't get it.
I mean, I didn't do anything.
- You have ten minutes.
- I don't know who all of you are, but somebody better start talking,
'cause I am not dying here today.
- Dude out there's full of shit.
- What makes you say that?
- I just know.
No one does this deal for real.
- Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is- the Lord is- shit!
Dude, how does the rest of it go?
- One of you has to know something.
What did you do?
- Don't look at me, bitch.
There's eight other guys in this room.
- Can anyone think of a reason why they're here?
He's gonna kill us, so there has to be something.
- Well, I'll be the first to admit that I have a pretty messed-up history, but I don't know who that guy is or why I'm here.
- And I'll be the last to admit shit.
To hell with that guy.
He's a punk, and my money says that he's a cop.
- What?
- You're insane.
The punk-ass pig puts a bunch of criminals in one room.
All right?
Gets them all scared and crowing about the shit that they did.
The cops write up a list and bust us all.
I'm not saying shit.
- This is not a setup by the cops.
- I had a friend a couple years ago, got in a barroom fight with a guy.
Guy turns out to be a cop.
A couple hours later, he's in room like this.
They threw him a hell of a blanket party.
The guy never did walk the same since.
- It's not the cops.
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I'm a fucking genius, okay?
- Yeah, well, anything is possible.
- I had a customer a couple of weeks ago threaten to kill me when I cut him off at the bar.
But then he drove his car into a building.
- Maybe this is all just a mistake.
- What, do you think he kidnapped all of us by mistake?
Look, he's obviously crazy, so that's something we can use to our advantage.
- Are we supposed to think of a crime that's so horrible that he would kill nine people as a result, some horrible crime that we did?
- I'm sorry, Father, but the worst thing one person can do to another is child molestation.
- Never.
I never would do such a thing.
- I have.
- Was it, like, boys or girls?
- Does it matter to you?
- No, no.
- Me neither.
- Oh, you sick son of a bitch.
- You put me in a room with you and no windows and no doors, and you're gonna wish that you were never born.
- Sweetie, we are in a room with no windows or doors, and the only thing you're gonna do is try to survive, just like me.
- Maybe you deserve to die.
- What I've done might have gotten me here, but you two and all of you...
What have all of you done to deserve the death penalty?
Hmm?
- My name is Eddie Vigoda.
- Hi, Eddie.
- Maybe that helps somebody.
- No, Eddie.
No, it doesn't.
I'm Dean Jackson.
- I'm Kelley Murphy.
I'm an assistant district attorney for Los Angeles County.
- Can you think of anyone you've put away that would want revenge, like a crazed killer, you know, some escaped psycho?
- Take your pick.
I mean, I've made more than a few enemies, but there are people that keep tabs on parolees that might come after me.
And no one saw this guy coming.
Jackson, anything you'd like to add?
- Huh?
- I know you.
- Says you.
- We did some business together years ago.
I'm sure it was small-time stuff for you, but it was pretty big for me.
My name is Christian Collinsworth.
- What kind of business are you in?
- Sully's with the mob.
You know, it doesn't surprise me that you don't remember me.
It's been a long time.
- What's your name, anyway, man?
- Sully Fenton from Vegas.
- What kind of business did you two do together?
- Ask the kid.
Hell if I know.
- A deal came my way, some pharmaceutical-grade speed.
I was about five grand short, so I went to Sully.
I heard he was in the business of loaning money for drugs for part of the product and profits.
- I'm sure five grand sounded pretty sweet to me at the time, especially selling meth.
- So what happened?
- I sold the stuff to these two cool guys who turned out to be undercover cops.
And I went in for three years.
- But you still paid me, right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everybody knows what happens when you don't pay Sully Fenton.
I'm not stupid.
- Are you sure about that?
- I had nothing going into prison.
I had even less getting out.
But I got what I needed as soon as I hit the streets in May.
You were paid by the end of the month.
Now I'm an actor and bartender in Hollywood though.
- Good for you.
- I'm gonna miss my sitcom audition.
- Your audition?
Where the hell do you think you are?
- Jesus, will you cut the kid some slack already?
- We're all scared here.
He's doing his best.
- Hey, is Sully the only one who's not from Los Angeles?
- Uh-uh.
My travels have taken me all over, including Los Angeles.
More than a few prisons.
- I'm Father Michael Francis.
I have Catholic parish in the San Fernando Valley.
- Eddie, where are you from?
- Barstow.
- You guys forgot about me.
- You said you ain't talking.
I just figured you're from Los Angeles, since, you know, the city's chock-full of you pussies.
- I got your pussy.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
No one appreciates your pissing match more than I.
But I think we're forgetting about someone.
- Do you speak English?
English?
- Say something.
I know you understand us.
- Does anybody know what this language is?
Anyone know what it is?
- Chinese, I think.
- How the hell do you know?
- Old-school kung fu flicks.
- It's annoying, whatever it is.
I hope he cap her ass first.
Nigger!
The chick does speak English.
- Yeah, she's funny.
- Let's see who lives and dies first.
- This situation stinks of a pig setup.
- Jesus.
- Told you.
- God, for the last time.
This has absolutely nothing to do with the cops.
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I am a cop!
- I knew it.
I knew it.
- I thought if I told you scumbags I was L.A. County, you wouldn't say anything, knowing I was one of the good guys.
- Good guys?
- Yeah.
- You're one of the good guys?
- Yeah.
- In my old neighborhood, the cops weren't the good guys.
- I'm not a scumbag.
- I'll make you a bet that our masked host comes back in here, grabs one of us, brings him outside, shoots the gun up into the air, and we all think he's dead.
- Yeah, that's what he's gonna do.
He's gonna sweat us.
That's what he's gonna do.
- You think?
- Yeah, he's gonna do that.
- Really?
- Come on, guys, come on.
We can do this.
Yeah.
If he figured out why we're all here, we can figure it out.
- You know what?
I really appreciate your can-do spirit, but if this pig is wrong, my name's Coogan.
And I got to say, what a pleasure it was to spend the last ten minutes of my life with you all.
- Well, we still haven't gotten your name.
- You didn't?
Miss chink over there said it plain as day.
It's what you
Nigger.
All right?
- Yeah, is that with one G or two?
- Oh, that-that-
With two.
- You think this is funny?
This isn't funny.
- Hey, what else am I gonna do?
In about three seconds we're gonna find out if Coogan's right about this being a bust, or we're gonna find one of us dead.
- Why are you here?
- You got to give us more time.
You're asking the impossible.
We're all willing to do whatever you want.
But you have to give us something in return.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
How could I have known that?
Please just wait a second.
Please don't!
- What are you doing, man?
God!
Fuck.
Sorry to see him go, but that's one less to worry about, right?
- As I said, you have to know why I brought each and every one of you here in order to survive.
If you want to walk out of here alive, you'd better figure out why he was here as well.
- I can't die like this.
- Please, God.
We ask that you-
- Hey, Father.
You think we can toss the idea of him faking the killing outside the door?
Who are you praying to?
God's not here.
- You still think this is the cops?
If we don't figure out what's going on before somebody else dies, we're not gonna get out of here alive.
- Well, does anybody here speak Chinese?
- I speak a little Spanish.
- Habla espa駉l?
- Really?
Oh, oh.
No dice.
- Padre, you sure you didn't touch no kids?
- I have never harmed a child in my life.
Anyway, that thing over there, he's already admitted to the crime, so stop looking at me.
- Hey.
Guys, I might be a little screwed up, but I just spent five years in jail.
I'm trying to be a reformed man.
- What did you serve time for?
- Grand theft auto.
- Not child molestation?
- No, that's all they could hit me with.
You see, they couldn't find a body.
- Wow, you're a winner, ain't you?
- Thank you.
- Piece of shit.
- I think it's about time we heard from you.
- All right.
I'm Leon, from L.A.
My brother and I used to do work up and down the West Coast.
- What kind of work did you do?
- Looking for this?
Don't give me those fucked-up looks.
At least I never sexed and killed no kids.
I never killed anybody.
But I'd rob your ass if the price was right.
Cash is king, and I stick to what works.
But guns?
Guns can be better than cash.
- Kelley, did you ever prosecute Leon?
- No, he doesn't look familiar.
- That's because
I never got caught.
- Yeah, well, our friend out there caught you.
- Yeah, coming out the USC library no less.
- The library?
- Yeah, it pays to do research in my business.
- If the cop and Kelley know each other and Christian and Vegas Sully know each other, then it would make sense that we're all connected here, whether we know it or not.
- Well, if I busted you, you guys would know better than me.
I mean, that list is long.
- Yeah, I'm in the same boat.
I wouldn't even know where to begin.
But in my business, we don't do this shit.
- I forget how you people can be so thoughtless and careless when it comes to human life.
I spend every waking moment serving God by trying to help people in my community, and all you seem to do is try to destroy life.
- You put yourself up on a pedestal, but you're here just like the rest of us.
So why don't you stop talking about why you shouldn't be here, and let's figure out why you are.
- Hey, Eddie.
Eddie.
- What?
- Nobody's stopping you from talking, Eddie.
- I work for a health insurance carrier.
I'm from Barstow.
- That's fascinating.
Any other useless facts you'd like to pass around?
- I'm doing my best.
- Tell us about your work.
What do you do?
Come on, what do you do, Eddie?
- Okay.
A couple of years ago,
I helped out my brother-in-law.
He has colon cancer.
My company does a lot of experimental medical work, and I falsified his forms so that he can get the treatment.
But I did it to help my brother-in-law.
I mean, this doesn't make sense.
I'm a good person.
I don't deserve to be here.
I shouldn't be here.
- Hey!
Relax there, leaky faucet.
- Okay.
I'm human.
- Jesus Christ, Eddie.
- So you know, I mean, all right.
Everybody have a look.
You know, laugh.
But you know what?
If we don't start confessing,
I mean, we're never gonna make it out of here alive.
Everybody- everybody's got to help.
- Jackson and I used to sleep together.
- Ooh.
- Yeah, until my wife found out.
- Would your wife go this far to get back at you for cheating on her?
- No, she divorced me and moved to Arizona.
I think that's far enough.
Plus, she has no way of getting us all here together.
And she has no reason to.
I pay my alimony.
I don't think she hates me that much.
- No ex-wife would want her man dead.
That's her money train.
- Look, no one knows you two, so I doubt it's the ex-wife.
- And nobody really wants to hear about your sex life.
- Yeah, well, she's just pissed off,
'cause we got caught.
- Yeah, it was your big mouth that got us caught.
- You know what, Kelley?
You're not the only one who got hurt.
I lost my wife.
- Yeah, and I was labeled the home-wrecking slut.
That did wonders for my career.
- And I wasn't the only person you were screwing around with.
What was it, a month before some judge knocked you up?
- Hey, kitty cats.
Why so hostile?
An affair is an affair.
- Now we're getting relationship advice from a pedophile.
- Mm.
- What the fuck you looking at?
- You one tall drink of water.
- Oh, you're turning faggot now?
- No, I just realized how I'm getting out of here.
None of you guys are gonna come up with shit.
Closest one to me.
- What are you doing?
- So start kicking.
- You are crazy, man.
- You got a better idea?
Break my hand so I can get out these cuffs.
- You're crazy.
- I'm not kidding.
Start kicking, man.
- All right.
My pleasure.
- Come on, game it up.
- I'll get it.
- Wait!
- Come on!
Stop.
- Wait, I almost got it.
Oh, come on.
One more, one more.
Just do it.
- Okay, okay, okay.
All right, all right.
- Leon, Leon, get up.
Hey, get behind the door.
And when he comes in, you push him in, and we'll attack him.
- Yeah, bring him my way.
- Leon, get behind the door.
Come on.
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.
- But I got a better one.
Later.
- Oh, you can't leave us.
Bitch, you think I give a damn about you?
To hell with you.
- Leon, you can't leave us in here like this.
- You stupid piece of shit!
- Don't do it.
You know you can't leave us in here.
- Don't leave us here.
- Damn it!
- Oh, fuck!
Punk-ass bitch.
Huh?
You stupid fucking bitch.
The thoughts that's been going through my mind while I was in that fucked-up room.
And that's a fucked-up room!
Now that I got this gun, the shit that I got in store for you.
- I have been planning this for two years.
Nothing is gonna take away what I have in store for you and the others.
And I mean nothing.
Before I enter,
I place one bullet into that gun you hold.
But this gun?
This gun holds six.
- Fuck.
- He didn't make it.
- Why are you here?
- Maybe you should move them out of the way of the splatter.
I'd hate to see somebody die before you get a chance to kill 'em yourself.
Yeah.
That's a good reason.
- God, please.
You don't have to do this.
- Up until now, the order has been random.
I just want you to know that you're next.
- Fuck you.
- Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou-
Blessed art thou amongst women.
I can't remember the prayer either.
I used to know it.
I've said it like a million times.
Can you help me, Father?
What?
What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I can't remember, but it's so familiar.
- Oh, look.
We got another ten minutes.
It can take me that long to find my keys in the morning.
- You finding something funny there, bleeding boy?
I'm gonna die like the man said, and you guys are gonna die with me.
I got eight minutes to live.
And I've been thinking about you bitches.
I got to make peace.
- Look, if you're gonna die a happy man, then I'm gonna die a happy man laughing at your misery.
- Look, we know Leon's next to go.
That means we have eight minutes to figure out why he was here and another ten minutes before somebody else dies.
- Come on, we can figure this out.
Let's put our heads together, guys.
Come on, we can do this.
- Something turned the slant on.
- It's almost comical if you watch it right.
- Pictionary?
- Glasses?
Glasses.
- I haven't worn glasses in years.
- I remember when you wore glasses.
This lady knows you, or she did know you.
- Bang, bang!
- A shooting?
Some kind of shooting, a shooting?
- Robbery?
- Bang!
- Robbery!
- Mrs. Chan?
- Chan, Chan!
- Her name is Nhung Chan.
- Did you get the guy who robbed her?
- Yeah, Chan picked him out of a lineup.
I prosecuted.
He went to San Quentin.
- What was this guy's name?
- Greeley, Wade Greeley.
He was a total punk kid,
20 years old.
A total loser.
- So that's it?
That's why we're here?
Because this kid Wade Greeley is pissed off that you sent him to prison?
- All we have here is a robbery and a name and a whole hell of a lot of unanswered questions.
Okay, I don't even remember busting this guy,
Wade Greeley.
- What about you, Father?
Does any of this mean anything to you?
- I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
- Okay, if Wade Greeley going to jail is the end-all-be-all, then we must fit in to this before that happened.
- I think I've got us a time line.
- You know, listening to you guys,
I've got a glimmer of hope.
I thought for a sec you had the son of a bitch beat.
- Well, well, well.
Look who's back from the dead.
- Ease up, man.
Ease up.
I'm having a change of heart or something like that.
I'm thinking letting you people die, it's not right.
I haven't done nothing good in a long time.
I said I never killed nobody.
That's a lie.
I want my cut of cash you gave that bitch of yours.
- What cash?
Man, you fucking tripping.
- I know about the money belt and those Brentwood bitches last month.
- You accusing me of holding out?
- Nah, I'm straight saying it.
Don't turn your back to me, man.
Click!
Pull guns on people?
- For sure, motherfucker.
- I got a gun too.
I dumped his body in a dumpster in downtown L.A.
At the Cinco de Mayo festival.
He said he never liked the Mexicans and their parades.
One last childish act on my part.
A couple of days later I went to the morgue with our mother.
I stood over the body.
I didn't say anything.
I went to the street and sold the rest of our stuff.
Wow, I never told nobody that.
I didn't speak or see too much of my mother after the funeral.
I'll never see either of them again.
I'll never have a chance to say I'm sorry.
I want my mother to forgive me.
I deserve to die.
I want to be forgiven.
Somebody just forgive me.
- He who seeks forgiveness shall find it.
- We're no better off than we were before.
We have nothing new, and there's like a minute left.
- Here's something new.
That guy said he's been planning this for two years.
- Okay, what were we all doing two years ago?
- Two years ago
I did thirty days for busting some joker in the head for hassling one of my dancers.
But no one is going to give two shits about that one.
- No.
- Two years ago I was just-
I had the same job selling insurance, approvals, dismissals.
I don't know.
It's nothing unusual.
- Kelley?
Kelley?
Two years ago?
- Why are you here?
- We know part of the answer.
We've got some of it.
- All or nothing.
- Son of a bitch.
I'll see you in hell.
- I know.
- What are you doing?
Stop this!
Father, you still with us?
- You're not going to like what I have to say.
- Anything is better than nothing at this point.
- Either say it or don't.
- I figured out why I am here.
- Well, holy shit!
- I know why someone else was in this room as well.
I know what we have done to the man that holds us captive.
- So what is it?
- Yeah, spill it.
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?
Come on, Father.
- What was said to me was said in confidence.
I can't repeat it.
- You want to play Pictionary or something? Fine.
Me and you, Father, against her and Mandarin Duck.
- I can't reveal what was said to me.
There's nothing I can do.
My relationship with God goes beyond my life and yours.
- This is bullshit, Father.
- You better start talking right now, or so help me,
I will goddamn crack that head of yours.
- You'll do what?
I'm facing death already.
I have no fear of death when it comes to upholding the Lord's law.
My loyalty will not be questioned.
My devotion does not exist only when the situation deems convenient.
- People are dead because of you.
- You don't know that to be true.
- The hell I don't, cocksucker!
Leon laid there dying, but at least he had the balls to speak his mind, even though it went against his own fucked-up judgment.
And now you're going to have all of us die because you're gonna keep quiet behind some collar and dusty oath?
- Sully, would you turn in your brother for a lighter sentence?
- My brother's dead.
- So then your father.
Would you give up your father to save your own skin?
- I would never cross my father.
- So then you can understand my situation.
- No, I can't!
- It's like waking up from one nightmare into another.
- Shut the hell up, Eddie.
- If Father Francis has made up his mind, we're just gonna have to get out of here without him.
- What?
You're defending the cocksucker?
- No.
But I got a wife to get home to, and we're wasting time arguing.
- To hell with Francis, okay?
If he's not gonna talk, we're never gonna figure out why he's here.
So if we want to live, we're gonna have to escape.
Okay, we're gonna have to take him down.
And we have to face the fact that we may have to kill him.
- On, I ain't got no problem with that.
- Okay, hold on.
What do we know?
We know Greeley robbed
Chan's liquor store.
And we know Kelley prosecuted him.
- Okay, well, that's two out of nine, Eddie.
- Maybe there's more to it.
Maybe it goes beyond those people who are directly responsible for him going to jail.
Maybe he's thinking in bigger terms.
- Yeah, maybe we're not all connected in this.
Maybe he's going after everybody that's ever done anything wrong to this guy.
- We need to come clean.
Completely clean about everything, right now, all of us.
- All right.
You want a story?
Eight years ago this old man came in and slapped me around in front of my crew.
Some crazy bastard who owed me money came in and tried to punk me in front of my people.
I went back to his pawn shop that night.
Yeah, I went back, and I firebombed it.
Boom!
The problem... the problem...
I didn't know he lived upstairs in an apartment with his grandkids.
That's why I deserve to die.
- It was my first year on the force,
I was working the valley division, and my partner got into it with this speed freak.
It was bad.
The kid was all tweaked out, and my partner was having a really rough day.
The kid took a swing at my partner, and that was it.
He beat the hell out of this kid.
I really wanted to stop it, but he looked up at me.
He looked at me, and he asked me if I wanted to join in.
- You joined in?
- Yeah, I didn't want to hurt my reputation.
You know, I mean, it was my first year out on the street.
I mean, you know what I mean,
Kelley.
- So you beat the kid.
- Yeah, but God damn it,
I'm not proud of it.
- Well, did you go to Internal Affairs?
- No.
I stuck around for two more years and got transferred out of there.
- So why would your old partner pull you down here if you never turned him in or told anyone?
- It wasn't my partner.
I was thinking maybe the kid finally tracked us down not for beating him up.
For blinding him.
- That's awful.
What was the kid's name?
- Alfie Martinez.
And I don't know if that's the reason why I'm down here, but that's what haunts me every day of my life, that I didn't stand up.
I didn't have the courage to do anything, to stand up to my superiors.
- So if your old partner is still alive, wouldn't it make sense that he'd be in here with us?
- Yeah, that's just a dead end, another dead end.
- I'm telling you, we're wasting time.
We've got to find our own way out of here like Leon did.
- Yeah, that worked out real well for him.
- Yeah, sing it, sister!
Hallelujah!
Right, cocksucker?
- Shut the hell up, Sully!
- We got to think of something.
I just thought of something.
I don't know if this is anything, but since we're confessing our sins, and there is a priest here-
- All right, just spit it out,
Eddie.
- When I was in college, we had some girls- strippers over for a party.
We were all drinking, and I spent some time with one of them.
We both got really drunk, and-
- And you banged her.
- Yeah, but she said it was rape.
- Oh, and here all this time we thought you were so perfect.
It turns out you're just another asshole frat boy.
- They dropped the charges due to lack of evidence.
- Mom and dad must have been so proud.
- I'm just trying to help.
- I mean, something might click.
Isn't that the whole point?
- No, you're getting us further away from the point
I was trying to make.
- Guys, look, this is about the robbery.
We're missing something.
I know we are.
- No, there's nothing else with the robbery; I promise you.
- What was that, Francis?
- You know we're going down the wrong road, don't you?
- Yeah, 20 years of poker tells me that's a "yes. "
What do you know, Father?
- Forget about the robbery!
Okay, it doesn't matter what he knows.
- Shut up, Kelley!
- You were about to beat that kid to death, and now you won't help me kill the guy who's ready to execute us all?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What's wrong with all of you?
- Hey, I'm with you, Kelley.
But this cocksucker here is about ready to crack, and I'm pretty damned interested to hear what he has to say.
- I know you want to tell us,
Father.
- Aw, come on.
You ready to break that oath, Father?
- This isn't easy, okay?
- Just say it.
- It's the right thing to do.
- What if I said that I knew for a fact that Wade Greeley did not rob Chan's store?
- Bullshit.
Chan was the eyewitness.
Greeley didn't have an alibi, and I had the evidence, concrete evidence.
- Did Greeley say he was innocent?
- Of course he said he was innocent.
Everybody's innocent.
Nobody wants to be convicted once they're caught.
- What do you know about it,
Father?
- No, I'm telling you.
Greeley was guilty.
- Son of a bitch.
- What?
- One of us confessed to the crime in Father Francis' confessional.
I bet that's it.
- Is that it?
Is it, Father?
- Whatever Father Francis knows, he knows from the confessional.
Otherwise, he would tell us.
- Has anyone ever been to confession in the San Fernando Valley?
- Yeah, right.
- No.
- Christian!
It has to be Christian.
- You all saw the father's face when I couldn't remember the Hail Mary.
I reminded him of Christian.
He forgot the same prayer earlier.
Remember?
What could Christian have told
Father Francis?
- That he robbed the liquor store.
- You've known this whole time?
- I did not know the whole time.
It wasn't until after Chan came up with the robbery that I knew for sure.
- Cocksucker!
- I told you you wouldn't like what I had to say.
- Are you absolutely positive that it was Christian in the confessional?
- The Lord is with thee.
Dude, how does the rest of that go?
- If I had a Bible,
I would put my hand on it.
- You got the wrong man, prosecutor.
Wade Greeley's the wrong guy.
- I had the evidence against him.
- Regardless, I mean, this is a whole new ball game now.
- Holy shit.
Sully.
- Yeah?
- Christian got out of jail the same time
Chan's store was robbed.
- So what does that have to do with me?
- What happens to people who don't pay you?
- If they owe a little,
I go for their knees.
If they owe a lot,
I go for their jugular.
- Yeah, well, does Christian look like the type of kid that could take a beating?
- So what?
What are you saying?
- Christian robbed Chan to get you the money.
He said that he got out of jail in May and paid you soon after.
How else could he have gotten the money?
It fits.
- Wait a second.
So you're telling me, of all the fucked-up shit
I've done through the course of my life,
I loaned some dead dumbass five grand, and that's what
I'm gonna die for?
- The kid needed a motive.
I think you're it.
That's goddamn ridiculous.
You're serious?
All I did was give him some cash.
I got to die for that?
That's bullshit!
- The connection between you and Christian has been there the whole time.
We just never thought anything of it.
- Oh, and I still don't.
Of all the shit I- oh, hey there, asshole!
- Why are you here?
- You know what?
We don't know.
But guess what.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't know what kind of shit you got going on here, but I'm sick of it.
You've got me sweating, rethinking all the horrible things that I've done in my life and all the people I've crossed.
For what?
For some dumbass that I loaned
$5,000 to?
Well, guess what.
That's how I do business, and that's how I get shit done.
I don't apologize for shit.
- Knowing what you know, knowing how your life will end, would you change the way you do business?
- Hell no!
I don't regret anything.
I wouldn't do a damn thing different.
What's the matter?
You don't like that, do you, you dirty revenge-seeking pussy?
I don't regret anything.
What, you want me to regret my life?
Fuck you.
Oh, you want the satisfaction of me begging for my life, don't you?
Fuck you.
You want the satisfaction of killing all of us, thinking it's gonna change our lives.
Whah, whah, whah.
Well, fuck you!
I take that back.
I take all that back.
Yeah.
I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of me being pissed off while I die.
Of all the shit you could have killed me for, five grand?
Fuck you!
Come on, bastard.
Let's do this.
Hit me right here in the head, just like my brother.
Reunite me with him.
Come on, asshole!
Pull the trigger.
- But it's not your turn.
It's Eddie's.
- Me?
No, no, no.
Please, no.
No, no.
Don't kill me.
Just tell me why I'm here.
- Damn it!
One person dies every ten minutes.
That's what you said!
Father Francis is dead.
You cannot take Eddie now.
- Really?
Five grand?
- You shouldn't be in such a hurry to die.
If this is the end for you, you'll want to make every minute count.
- This doesn't have to continue.
Okay, we know why you brought most of us here, and we know what you must have been feeling, what you must be feeling now.
Okay, I think I speak for all of us when we say we wish we could go back and change history, but we can't.
Wade.
Wade Greeley?
Whatever it is that you think we've done to you, whatever- whatever it is you've done here today, we can make right.
You just have to talk to us.
Look, we can help.
I can help.
Okay, whatever it is you want, we-we-
I can make that happen.
Do you understand what I'm telling you, Wade?
- I'm not Wade Greeley.
- It's not Wade Greeley.
This doesn't make any sense.
- There's way too many coincidences for it not to be this guy, Greeley.
- I've spent five grand on a bottle of whiskey without a care in the world.
- Sully, we get it.
- I'm telling you, he's gonna kill us all.
Okay, he doesn't care if we come up with his plan.
- If he just wanted to kill us, we'd be dead already.
He's here to make a point.
But do we really think this isn't Greeley?
- If it isn't, it has to be somebody close to him, somebody that could help him plan this.
Kelley, back at the trial, was there anyone there?
Were there any friends or family, anyone who stood by him?
- No, no, he didn't have anything or anyone.
I don't even think he made bail.
- Can you give us a few more details?
- Jeez, this was so long ago.
Do you realize how many trials
I've had since then, since before then?
- Okay, let's think.
Leon said that he'd been planning this for two years.
When did Greeley's case go to trial?
- I don't remember.
- Can you at least tell us how many years he got in prison?
- Armed robbery, assault, no plea.
Five years, maybe.
- Well, then the years don't add up.
If I was wrongly convicted of a crime,
I would start plotting my revenge the day I was convicted.
- That's what I'm saying.
Nothing about this makes sense.
The only way we're gonna get out of this is if we escape.
- Was Christian in the lineup when Chan picked Greeley?
- No, if Christian was in the lineup,
Chan would have recognized him when we pulled the hoods off.
- She didn't recognize Kelley until later.
- Well, maybe she did.
I mean, nobody understood what she was saying.
- Mrs. Chan?
- Give it up.
We're getting off track.
- I'm just coming up with possibilities.
- Well, to hell with your possibilities.
- Why are you pissed at me?
- Because maybe we still don't know jack about you!
- Are you really that stupid to think I'm hiding something?
I told you everything that I can think of, so don't blame me.
- Something about you still doesn't sit right with me, Eddie.
- You know, you've been riding me and picking on me this whole time.
What is your problem?
- I might be dead in ten minutes!
That's my fucking problem!
- I think we all know who's next.
- Calm down.
- What about you, Jackson?
We still don't know why you're here.
All we know is that you beat a kid blind and cheated on your wife.
- Well, look who's grown some balls.
- I think I got it.
- You better watch your tone Eddie, or I'm gonna start thinking you're the psycho's partner, or at least until I see your brains against the wall.
- Yeah, yeah, well, not if I see yours first.
- Fine, go ahead!
Sign me up!
- Hey, shut up!
All right, you guys are worse than my strippers.
Now listen.
Leon said that he killed his brother and dumped him during the
Cinco de Mayo parade, remember?
- So what?
- Well, Christian said that he got out of jail in May.
- And?
- What if that was around the same time?
Look, Christian got out of jail, right?
And he said he got my five grand right afterwards, right?
Well, if we go back and think about it,
Christian said that he had nothing when he left jail.
- I had nothing going in to prison.
I had even less getting out.
- But somehow he was able to pull off this big liquor store robbery heist?
Where did he get a gun to rob Mrs. Chan?
- Leon said the easiest product to move were guns.
- Guns can be better than cash.
- So you think Leon sold the gun to Christian that he used to rob Chan's liquor store?
- So Sully gave Christian the motive for the robbery.
Leon gave him opportunity.
Chan identified the wrong man.
Kelley locked him up.
And Father Francis didn't go to the cops after he found out the truth.
Okay, so that leaves Jackson, me, and Coogan.
But we can all agree that this all started with Christian borrowing money from Sully.
Between that and Greeley going to jail is our new time line.
When Christian borrowed the money from Sully,
I was studying pharmaceuticals in Arizona.
- Okay, well, Christian said that he was dealing drugs.
Could he have gotten them from you?
- No.
I didn't have any access to drugs.
- All right, all right, we've narrowed this down some.
- Narrowed it down?
All we got is a robbery, drug dealing, and a pedophile.
Sorry, buddy.
- Buddy?
- Look, Sully is a criminal.
Okay, he's a killer.
We would have taken him down
100 times if we had the chance.
Now he's your best friend?
- Oh, I'm sorry for liking the guy who's trying to save my life.
- Thank you.
And for bacon, you're not so bad yourself.
- Look, our only chance is that we think
Eddie might be next.
And then hopefully after that,
Sully's next.
So you and I can take him down.
- God, you are one twisted home-wrecking bitch.
- Oh, well, it's good to know it only takes a gun to your head for you to speak your mind.
- You know what?
The worst thing I did was not beating that kid till he was blind.
It was fucking the lawyer.
- Oh, ouch, that hurts.
Jackson, I hope you die for getting me into this.
- What are you talking about?
I didn't get you into this.
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.
You just said that Jackson got you into this.
What does that mean?
- What does what mean?
We have, like, seconds left till he comes in.
- Why are you here?
- Because this bitch knows something, and she won't talk!
- Please, please!
I beg you!
You can't kill me.
You have to let me go.
My child needs me.
Okay, my son needs his mommy.
You're a human being.
You can understand.
You can't take a mother away from her son.
- Your son William goes to the Sacred Heart School, where he is picked up every day by your hired help.
And when was the last time you actually spent time with him?
And how long will it be before you pack him off to some boarding school?
Do not use your child as an excuse.
It pisses me off.
And it should piss you off as well.
- What was he talking about,
Kelley?
- It looks like you might be a dad, Jackson.
- Billy's mine?
I didn't think I could.
My wife and I, we'd been trying for-
I didn't think it was possible.
- Yeah, well, it's possible.
Maybe if you had spent a little less time with me and a little more with her.
- How could you do that to me?
How could you just keep that from me?
I know our relationship, the breakup was bad, but how could you just cut me off like that?
- I had to do what was best for me.
Okay, jackass over there was never gonna leave his wife.
He would rather just lead me on.
So when I found out,
I just blamed it on someone else.
- What you did was wrong and downright selfish.
You need to start talking.
And it doesn't matter what you're holding back.
I don't care.
I forgive you, but we have to get out of here alive.
- Do you want to die?
- I might as well be dead if this gets out.
- Before, you said Jackson got you into this.
How?
- Look.
Wade Greeley was picked up two miles from the liquor store.
He was a good match to Chan's description.
And no one could verify his lame-ass alibi.
And then Chan picked him out of the lineup.
I had him.
I had to have him.
You remember what I was going through, Jackson.
The mother and son, the abortion case:
Two in a row lost.
- I was just getting into the life that I had worked so hard for, and I felt the pressure.
You know, I had to have a conviction, or I was on my way out.
I was the lowest on the totem pole, and no one was taking me seriously.
I had to win at all costs.
- Losing cases doesn't make you incompetent.
- No, but combine that with budget cuts and an affair with Jackson that was growing more public every day, and it doesn't look good.
- What did you make me do,
Kelley?
- I had Chan's testimony, but it was shaky at best.
I would never be able convince a jury that a 60-year-old woman could positively identify someone, especially after she'd been pistol-whipped.
I had to put Greeley at the scene.
During the struggle,
Chan grabbed Christian by the head and got a few couple hairs.
So I knew I just had to get some of Wade's hair and make the switch.
So I snuck the sample out of the lab.
I got a few hairs from Wade's comb.
And- and I couldn't get the sample back into the evidence room.
- And I thought me and Coogan were the most fucked-up two in this room.
- Don't you realize that you helped kill these people?
How could you not tell us this before?
- Look, if the truth ever gets out of this room, I'm over.
I'll lose my job.
I'll go to jail.
I'll never see my son again.
I might as well be dead.
I committed a felony.
- Yeah, welcome to my world.
- You know, I know we're not a team or a family, but we have a child together.
Doesn't that mean something?
- No, he's my son, Jackson, okay?
You're not a father.
You'll never be a father.
You were just a dick, literally.
You're fucking unbelievable,
Kelley.
- You're not a father.
- What?
- No, no, no.
Hear me out for a second.
Greeley said that he wasn't
Wade Greeley.
- I'm not Wade Greeley.
- Did you see how upset he got when Kelley tried to use her son for pity?
- Do not use your child as an excuse.
It pisses me off.
- I mean, if it's not really Wade, then maybe it's his father.
- Has anybody thought about what happened to Wade Greeley after he went to prison?
- Remember when I said
Wade Greeley going to prison was the end-all-be-all?
Well, I could have been wrong.
- Jackson was on to something a minute ago.
We've been trying to see how
Coogan and I fit into the time line before the trial.
We weren't thinking about what happened after prison.
You said that Wade was in San Quentin.
Did Christian say what prison he was in?
- No, but the sick fucker over there said he'd been to a couple of prisons.
- My travels have taken me all over, including Los Angeles.
More than a few prisons.
- This must mean something.
- Christian couldn't have known
Wade Greeley.
Christian got out of prison before Wade Greeley went in.
But Coogan knowing Wade Greeley, that's a possibility.
- That just leaves me.
- Wait, wait!
We need more time!
- Why are you here?
- Look, we think it has something to do with what happened to your son after he went to prison.
- Isn't this what you want?
You want us to think about our lives and our actions and crimes and how they've affected other people?
Well, that's what we are doing, and it's killing us.
- Look, no one has suffered like you and your son.
Okay, no one here was on trial.
No one here was punished for their crimes.
We've just gone on with our lives and never looked back.
But you have to look back every single day.
Look, you asked Sully if he would change, knowing what he's done.
Well, I guarantee, you ask anyone in this room now, and we would change.
We would change for the better.
- Now, speak for yourself, kiss-ass.
Kiss my ass.
- You could have died finding some humanity or humility.
- I'd rather go out in style.
- Maybe we do deserve to die.
- I just wish I knew why.
- What, you two are ready to give up?
You're both ready to die?
Well, fuck you both.
Okay, never give up.
I've lived through worse than this, and I'll live through this.
- Worse than this, Kelley?
What could possibly be worse than this?
- Well, back when you and I were still dating,
I was stupid enough in this day and age to think that I could walk to my car alone at night.
Some sweaty, bald-headed bastard grabbed me from behind and threw me in his van.
He bashed my head on the steel flooring.
I was dazed, but I could see that there was already blood there.
This wasn't his first time.
He put his hand over my face as he ripped my clothes off.
It's like my-my brain didn't really register the pain.
I just kept thinking about how I was gonna get this guy, this thing, you know.
And I was gonna put him away for the rest of his life.
I kept imagining the courtroom and how I would be looking into his eyes, and I would say,
"I'm the one that ruined your life. "
But then I realized we weren't in a courtroom.
There was no judge, no jury.
It was just me and this shit head who thought he could put his hands all over me.
Who the fuck was this guy to violate me, to take my life?
What right did he have to touch me?
I wasn't scared.
I was furious.
- Why didn't you tell me,
Kelley?
We could have done something about that.
- You could have searched everywhere.
You never would have found him.
When he was done, he rolled off me, and I saw that there was a baseball bat in his van.
And I grabbed it, and I hit him hard.
Then I stepped back, thinking someone must have seen, someone must have heard.
And as I waiting for someone to come help me,
I hit him again.
And then I hit him again.
And I just kept swinging.
And he just kept screaming.
You know, and he begged.
He begged.
Can you believe that?
I swear, I think that made me hit him harder.
And then- and then he just stopped screaming.
He stopped moving.
And I looked around again, and still no one was there.
No one heard.
No one cared.
So I went home, and I cleaned up, and I burned the bat in my fireplace.
And I just went on with my life like that.
It was just over.
And the next day when they found his body,
I made sure no one went looking for his killer.
And now I'm here.
And I promise you,
I promise you,
I will live through this, and I will survive at all- at all costs.
- What about rape?
We all heard Coogan.
He didn't care if it was boys or girls.
And if he was in the same prison with Wade, why not a 20-year-old kid?
- We did this to him.
- How could I have known what was gonna happen to him?
- Think about Wade Greeley, an innocent kid and all the things he went through.
And think about his father having to think about what happened to his son.
Think about that.
- When Coogan was shot, when Greeley came in here and shot him, what did Coogan say?
- I don't remember.
- What are you thinking?
- He said something about a splatter and killing everyone or something like that.
- Maybe you should move them out of the way of the splatter.
I'd hate to see somebody die before you get a chance to kill 'em yourself.
- Yeah, he was being a smart-ass.
He was talking about the bullet, if it went through him and killed somebody else.
- I thought the same thing.
But what if that's not what he meant?
What if the joke was about something else?
His blood, for instance.
His infected blood.
What if Coogan had AIDS?
- Whoa, that's a big stretch,
Eddie.
- Not really.
That's the final piece of our time line.
It starts with Christian borrowing money from Sully.
- I know you.
- Says you.
- No, we did some business together years ago.
- But then he loses that money after a bad drug deal and ends up in jail.
When he gets released, he buys a gun from Leon, uses it to rob Chan's liquor store,
'cause he still owes Sully the money.
Then Chan picks Wade Greeley out of the lineup.
Kelley makes sure the evidence fits her case and uses Jackson to secure that evidence against Wade for the trial.
Father Francis learns the truth during confession but being bound by God, says nothing.
So Wade ends up in prison where he has a run-in with Coogan.
And that's how I'm tied into all this.
- So why are you here?
- Back around the time when Wade would have been released from prison, my company had acquired the exclusive rights to an experimental drug therapy for AIDS patients.
It was said to prolong the life of people living with AIDS.
It was very new expensive.
I think Coogan infected
Wade Greeley with AIDS.
And the reason Wade's dad waited two years is because that's exactly how long his son lived outside of prison before he died.
- It's his father acting out revenge for the death of his son.
- Wade must have been one of the applicants for the new AIDS drug.
Part of my job was to turn down applicants.
Improper insurance, not enough money, wrong age, and criminal records.
I was the one whose name was signed to all letters denying applicants.
If I had accepted Wade into the program, he might be alive today.
That's it.
That's the answer he's looking for.
- So why are you here?
- Because your son died of AIDS.
He contracted it in prison from Coogan.
When he was released, you tried to get him into my company's drug therapy program, but they-
I turned him down.
Your son could be alive today if we all hadn't turned our backs on him and on you.
- He was so, so beautiful.
My son was a very brave and lovely boy.
And all of you made sure that he would never grow up to be a man.
It didn't have to end this way.
Any one of you could have prevented his death.
But you all saw him as a suspect or a number, a toy to be played with.
His only fault was that he became a part of your lives.
But it was his life.
And you destroyed it.
When we- when we leave here, my life will end, but you will all still have yours.
And I want you to remember, just remember this.
Remember what it is you have done.
And I hope that it haunts you until the day you die.
Show's over.
The police are already here.
They're in the building.
Unlock yourself and the other two.
It's time to leave.
- What are you doing?
He was letting us go!
- I told you I couldn't have anyone go to the police with my story.
I'd be ruined.
Survive at all costs, remember?
- So you're going to kill him?
- You're never gonna get away, no matter what you do.
- You don't get to make any more decisions.
You don't get to do or say anything.
- Jesus!
- I can't take this anymore!
Just get me the hell out of here.
- Kelley, look.
It's time for us to leave.
Just calm down, and we can all go home together.
Kelley, we survived.
Together we can do this.
We have a child together.
Come on.
- I can't have anyone know what I've done, Jackson.
- She's gonna kill us!
- Shut up, Eddie!
Let me handle this!
- Shut up, Eddie!
- No, no, look!
I'm not gonna say anything.
I swear!
- And you.
You've lost.
- Oh, I haven't lost.
I've been in control the whole time.
See, everybody's been watching.
Everybody now knows who the real Kelley Murphy is.
What will Kelley do now?
- You don't know me.
You don't know what I'm capable of.
- Oh.
Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Move over here.
Come on, this way, this way.
Over here.
Clear.
Here's your key.
Hello.
My bad. They gave me the wrong key.
Not your bad. We stay a little long.
We're now leaving soon.
Okay.
- What the fuck, guy?
- It's okay, Viktor.
He's here for the room.
Yeah.
You're on vacation.
Yeah.
I've actually never been here before. It's a pretty cool town.
Where are you guys from?
- Ukraine.
- Cool.
Now that he kidnapped me I don't know where we're gonna end up.
You're so dirty.
Enough. You're gonna wear me out.
Come.
Have a drink with us.
It's vodka, man. Don't be shy.
Come on, man.
Yeah. You know, it's--
Well, actually I've got some beer.
Do you guys drink beer?
It's still cold.
Beer?
Yeah.
I like this guy.
He brings party with him?
Come.
There you go.
- There we go. We do a cheers now? Nazdrovia.
- Sure.
- Nazdrovia.
- Nazdrovia.
Okay. I go take shower, then we go.
Oh, shit.
Fuck. I'm sorry, man.
No. For what?
Never mind. It's human nature.
- I'm looking everything that moves.
- Right.
- Okay.
- She's hot, right?
- Yes, she's pretty hot.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, we were in this club, crazy chicks. You go there, you're gonna score.
I have club card for you.
- No, no, no.  - You're gonna go in there, man. Connection.
Anka, I need that club's card.
- Hold on. I lose it.
- Okay.
Baby, I need the club card.
Anka!
Shit. Something's fucking wrong?
What the fuck? Anka!
Hey, get in here! We got a problem, man.
Anka.
Talk. Talk.
Hey, get in here, man. Come on!
I think she's having a heart attack or something. Talk to me!
What the fuck you doing, man? Get in here!
Anka, talk to me.
Come on, man. We gotta get her to a doctor.
Help me, man. Call a fucking doctor!
Hey! Come on, man!
What the fuck? Help me!
Call the fucking doctor! What the fuck you standing there?
What the fuck you doing, man? Get in here!
What--?
What is going on?
Anka.
Yeah, we're good to go.
Here.
Keep her dry. If she gets sick, we'll have to discount her.
Come on.
Save that shit for the honeymoon, please.
The best man.
You know, since I am the best man, which clearly I am, you know, why is it that she's marrying you?
You had your chance freshman year.
- What ever happened?
- I don't know.
You were a man-whore?
Not in front of her. Thanks for that.
Come on, let's go.
Again. More of this.
You get to kiss this jackhole for the rest of our life.
This weekend, he's mine.
- Such a dick.
- Don't let him bang any strippers.
What?
There are no strippers in Palm Springs.
Well, there's no decent strippers in Palm Springs, all right.
Once I get him out on the course, the only thing he's gonna be banging is five irons, Ames.
Okay.
- I'll call you from the hotel.
- Be safe.
All right.
- A little breakfast?
- No. I'm good. It's a little early.
- Even for you.
- This is nothing, man.
In a couple of hours, you are gonna be doing blow off some hot stripper's ass.
You said there were no good strippers in Palm Springs.
There aren't.
We're not going to Palm Springs, are we?
Holy shit.
Holy shit.
What the fuck is this?
Anka.
Anka.
Anka.
Get up!
Anka!
Hey! Who the fuck are you guys?
What the fuck you doing?
What the fuck you want with us?
Anka!
Hey!
Come to me!
You motherfuckers, don't touch her!
Don't touch her!
Come to me!
Come to me, motherfuckers!
Who are you? Where--?
Where the fuck are you taking her?
I don't wanna die!
Anka! I'm gonna come for you!
Let go! Let go!
No!
Anka!
Anka, I'm gonna come for you!
All you motherfuckers are gonna die!
No!
What's up? How's the leg?
It's okay. Carter.
How are you, Mike? I'm glad you made it.
Good to be here.
- How you doing? Wouldn't miss it.
- Thanks for coming.
We're not here for you.
We're here for this.
Bounce it. Up and down, north to south.
How great is this? Tits and ass at your table.
I could get all the stripper action I want, look my wife in the face and say
I never went to the club. Genius.
- Sit down. Let's do some damage.
- Okay. Cool.
Look at that.
Spade and neutered. What's up?
Yeah. Dude, some come for the free booze, I come not to lose.
Pay me, motherfucker.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner, bitches.
This whole place is a lab experiment.
Look. Look at it. There are no windows.
There are no clocks on the walls.
They pump oxygen in here to keep you awake.
They give you free booze to keep you drunk.
They parade women in front of you on top of that.
It's all just to take your money.
Man, this place is evil incarnate.
Yeah, maybe so, but not when you're winning.
Mikey, you're looking a little light over there.
Me? I'm golden. It's you I'm worried about.
Oh, God. Don't start this shit.
Wait, what shit?
His "don't do it" speech.
I've heard every version of it.
You're gonna tell him not to get married. You don't want him to get married, but-
- You're married, you know that, right?
- Yeah. I know.
And it's a living hell, Carter. Seriously.
Marriage is nothing but a three-ring circus.
Engagement ring, wedding ring, suffering. You'll see.
Yeah, but it's gonna be different for Scotty.
Really? Interesting. How exactly?
Because he's not marrying a bitch.
See, there it is.
He comes in with a--
I am getting married in one week, and you and your lovely wife
- are gonna be there.
- My lovely fat wife. Yes, we will.
- Okay, time to go.
- What are you doing? I'm hot.
That's why they sent over the cooler. Asians are bad luck.
You make good firecrackers, though.
That is just some racist bullshit.
I'm sorry, man. He did not mean that.
All right. So, what now?
Got Cirque du Soleil tickets.
So you're not only disabled, you're also gay.
Sometimes.
But it's not gonna matter too much because Scotty is getting seriously eye fucked by the girls at the progressive slots. See them?
Dude, they are hot. And I bet you they hate their fathers.
- Yes.
- What are you doing? Don't start.
I'm not doing anything.
Justin, do your thing. Limp on over.
Nothing wets a pussy like this hardware?
Pity fuck is still a fuck.
That's true.
Hey, guys.
- I'm Kendra.
- I'm Nikki.
Hi. I'm Scott. This is
Carter, Mike and Justin.
So you girls wanna join the party?
Not much of a party.
- We're just kind of getting started.
- We have a Jacuzzi.
It's in our room, if you guys wanted to head up there.
Smooth.
You guys have any better ideas?
We know a place, but it's off the Strip.
Yeah, it's way off the Strip.
I don't know, it might be too much for some nice boys from the suburbs.
It's a little freaky.
Do you like freaky?
We like freaky. We've always been into that sort of thing.
What about you?
Do you like freaky?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Hey, listen, on the radio here,
I love this guy. I have his records.
But do you think you could turn it down a couple of notches so we can hear ourselves?
Thank you.
Yeah. Do you think that those girls are pros?
- What, hookers?
- No, tennis pros.
Who cares? I wanna poke them in their vaginas with Justin's crutch.
Go check their oil with my tongue. Know what I mean?
A little low down there?
You need a fill-up?
Hey, you know your meter's not working, man.
You high rollers pay me
20 bucks, I call it even.
- You sure this is right?
- I think that's it back there.
The GPS shows it should be right here.
You see a club? I don't see a club.
All I see is a bacon factory.
What are you afraid of? Think
I'm gonna drive you to the alley where my friends steal your money and cut your heads off?
Okay, time to go.
- All right.
- Okay.
That is way off the Strip, all right.
- Are you sure this is it?
- It's the address she gave us.
Those girls were right.
This place is pretty freaky.
What you want?
We're here for the party.
You on the list?
Yeah. Nikki and Kendra sent us?
So you're that deal?
What does that mean?
It means you're gonna have a nice time.
Come on in. Down the hall.
Dude, this place feels fucked.
I think we should go.
- What, go check out Cirque du Soleil?
- Sure.
Your vagina's hanging out.
- What?
- Yeah.
- How did that get out?
- Second time today.
My goodness.
Well, we're here. Might as well see what it's all about.
"Might as well see what it's all about."
Dude, we're not going anywhere.
Oh, fuck. That's me.
- Fuck, dude.
- It's Amy.
You probably wanna take that.
- You're practically married.
- Guess what I do.
When I'm away from my wife, I turn off my phone. She can't call, can't text, can't make me send a photo of where I'm at because she's insecure.
- That's why your marriage sucks.
- She put on 30 pounds, so...
Amy, hey.
You said you would call when you got to the hotel.
I know, I'm sorry.
Look, we're just walking in somewhere, so I'm-- I gotta go.
So I'll call you when I get back to the hotel tonight?
- Scott.
- Yeah?
Should I be worried about you?
No.
Please don't do this.
You have nothing to worry about, okay? I love you.
Okay.
I love you.
Guys?
Very funny.
Hello?
Hello?
What the fuck? What are you doing?
Stop it! I can't fucking breathe!
Where the fuck are you taking me?
Let me go!
What the fuck?
Now, that's a bachelor party.
You fuckers!
You assholes!
I'm gonna shoot you. I'm gonna kill you.
- Are you in on it?
- I had no idea.
Scott! Scott! Scott!
Scott! Scott! Scott!
They won't put their clothes on.
They just won't do it.
Are you mad?
Maybe.
You guys set me up pretty good.
Hey, it's what they paid us to do.
So you're a...?
What do they call you now?
This week, "escorts."
Are you disappointed?
No.
Good.
Let's go.
Where?
The champagne room.
You are gonna get me in so much trouble.
Hey, I'm Angela.
Hey.
I'm Justin.
I'm sorry.
- Gotta get back to my friend.
- Sure thing.
Just so you know, darling, this thing stays hard all night.
Who lit the fuse on her tampon?
Tampon.
What is wrong with your friend?
A lot.
You're too sweet for her.
So why don't you stay here?
I want you to wait for me because I don't know how long your friend's gonna be, okay?
You ready?
I just came in my pants.
That's not my wife.
That's not my wife.
Don't tell anyone. Keep a secret.
Yeah.
No. No, no. Can we--?
Can we just--?
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Slow is cool.
We've got the room for an hour.
No, no.
No. I'm just thinking maybe we could just talk.
- Talk?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Like, are you from Vegas?
Is that what you wanna talk about?
No, no. It's just that...
No. It's just that...
Is this your first time?
No. I'm--
I'm getting married.
Not tonight.
Not tonight. No, not tonight.
Please, Kendra. Kendra. Wait.
Just relax, okay?
Nobody's gonna know anything.
Yeah. I know, I know.
No, but look--
Look, I was unfaithful last year.
All right, my fiancée found out and I almost lost her.
All right, I realize how fucking lame this sounds, I do, but I just...
I told myself that I wasn't gonna be that guy anymore.
Hey, I get it.
It's cool. Nothing has to happen.
We can just hang out.
At least, here.
Have another drink.
I just found out who killed JFK. You wanna know?
You still have your clothes on.
You are slow, you little bitch.
What's up?
- Somebody threw up in our room so--
- Somebody?
Yeah.
- Yeah, you did.
- Hey, you can't keep a secret.
Close your mouth, open your legs.
Close your mouth, open your legs.
- Are you okay?
- No.
No. I need to get some air.
Okay.
Air is good. Air is good. Get some H2O.
No, that's water. Hey.
What are you doing?
- Great.
- You're hot, but I need you to leave.
You're hotter. Hi, Nikki.
Indy 500.
One more, one more.
Open up!
Come on. Is anybody in there?
Please!
Open the fucking door.
Bachelor boy finally woke up?
Yeah. I think the warm piss in his pants did it.
We thought you were dead.
Just dead drunk.
Ugh. God.
You know, I would have carried you to bed, but you're fucking huge and
I've got a gimpy leg, so...
Last thing I remember, I was throwing up and got locked out of the club.
How did you get back here?
You were here when we got in.
The cabbie. The cabbie with the broken meter.
- Did you at least get laid?
- No. But she was a cutie.
That pisses me off because I paid that whore good money to rock your world. In advance.
Where's Mike? Did he pass out in the tub covered in his puke again?
Yeah, probably. But not here. He went home with that Nikki girl.
He hasn't resurfaced.
Did you try calling him?
Dude, his phone's in the sex dead zone.
He's miles from home. Remember?
It's not gonna be on until we get back to Phoenix.
- You've reached Mike.
- Voice mail.
- I'm in Vegas. Leave me alone!
- Hey, Mikey, it's Scott.
Turn your phone on, man.
We're looking for you.
I wouldn't worry too much about Mike.
He knows what time our flight is.
It's the spell of Vegas, man.
Like I said, it is pure evil.
Looks like Mikey was getting the bachelor party you were supposed to.
Yeah.
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck did you guys put in that champagne?
It's got a nasty aftertaste.
I know I ate some fucking pussy. What is this?
All right, I get it. I got you,
Scott. Now you got me.
Come on, guys. What the fuck?
- Shit.
- Yeah.
- You are in the shit.
- Who the fuck are you?
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- I'm not gonna die in here.
- Who said anything about dying?
- Come to me, motherfucker!
- What is going on?
Come on, you motherfucker.
What is he doing to him?
Oh, my God! Oh, my fucking God!
Get the fuck away from me!
Scott! Justin! What the fuck is going on?
There's our snaky motherfucker!
Oh, my fucking God.
Get the--
- I like when they fight.
- Yeah.
Fucking son of a fucking bitch!
Get the fuck off of me!
Fucking piece of shit!
Is this a fucking joke? What the fuck?
Fuck you!
Please. I didn't do anything. This is a mistake.
Guys, please!
My name is Mike Malloy from Arizona. Let me go.
Shut your mouth. Take it like a man.
- Fucking asshole.
- Fucking Jes--
Let me the fuck out of here.
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Get the fuck off of me!
No, no!
This is fucking bad.
Please. Fucking please.
What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing?
- Is this a fucking joke?
- Oh, yeah.
And the punch line is a killer.
My friends have money. We have money. We can pay you.
- We can pay you.
- You've already been paid for.
What the fuck is he talking about? What?
What do you mean "paid for"?
What the fuck is going on?
Who the fuck are these people?
No!
What the fuck is going--?
Who the fuck are you people?
What are you doing?
Oh, my God. What the fuck are you doing?
No, no. Get the fuck away from me. Get the fuck--
No, stop.
Stop. What the fuck are you doing?
Stop.
Oh, fuck.
No. What the fuck are you doing?
Please, don't let me--
Please.
Please, stop.
Stop! Stop!
Stop.
What is wrong with you?
This is a fucking mistake!
Please, stop. Please don't. Please.
What are you doing?
Please. Please.
I have a wife. I have a daughter, a son. They're 6 and 4.
Begging for family.
One minute, 58 seconds.
The over-under was two minutes.
Congratulations to players two, five and seven.
What the fuck is she talking about? What the fuck is going on?
I don't understand!
What the fuck is this?
This has to be a fucking joke. No!
No, please, don't.
Help me, please.
Hey, Mike, we're still looking for you.
We're starting to freak out a little bit. Call us back.
Maybe we should call his wife.
That sounds like a very good idea.
"Have you seen Mike? We left him at a party last night with a professional escort and he disappeared." Good idea.
What do you suggest?
He was probably up all night dicking that girl. Give him a couple of hours.
- We're just worried about him.
- Well, I'm not.
I mean, look around?
Everywhere you look, there are coeds and milfs and cougars, you know?
What are we gonna do?
- Look for him? Where?
- Where did you find those girls?
It's Vegas. It's not hard.
Was it some kind of service you called?
Yeah, it was
1-800-WHORES, man.
I know how to find him.
How?
I totally forgot. That girl,
Nikki, she gave me her card.
- That's her e-mail address.
- We need a street address.
Yeah. I know, it's called cyber stalking.
I'm pretty good at it.
Hey, Nikki, it's Justin,
the guy with the crutch from last night.
We're looking for our friend. We're wondering if you know where he is.
Please call me back. Thank you.
She definitely lives in a trailer park.
This is a classic Vegas fucking fairy tale.
- What number is it?
- W17.
- And where is that?
- You know, I don't know, Carter.
I don't have a white-trash locator on my phone.
Where is it? Is it one of these?
I think it's further up.
Are we getting warmer?
- Is this the one?
- Yeah.
Look, I don't think anybody's here.
Hello?
Nikki? Mike?
No.
Your show, man.
This is definitely a bad idea.
Okay.
- Are you coming?
- No.
I'll stay out here and keep watch, I guess.
God, it fucking reeks in here.
Mike?
Hello?
Jesus.
Does it look like he's been here?
I don't know.
I guess it would explain all these strap-ons, though.
He's obviously not here anymore.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
What the hell was that?
Justin.
Motherfuckers, get down!
All of you, on your fucking knees now!
It's me, Scott.
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?
- We need to talk to Nikki.
- So you broke into her house.
I think this is actually a trailer.
Shut up!
Okay, okay! Chill, chill!
Don't fuck with us. Why are you looking for Nikki?
Our friend Mike never came home last night.
She was the last one we saw him with.
And you think that he just shacked up with her.
He's such an all-star lay, she had to take him home.
Kendra, look, he wouldn't call us back.
We don't know what's going on.
This is obviously a scam to get more money out of us.
How much do you want?
What about you, meth mouth?
Carter, shut up!
Look, we're sorry that we broke in. We just wanna talk to her,
- see what she knows about Mike.
- You don't get it, do you?
I can't ask her.
Nikki didn't come home last night either.
Tacky hooker.
Too on-the-nose.
Much better.
What do you think?
Shut the fuck up.
Get it done.
What the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?
Nice and sweet, like you.
Wh--?
Help.
Help!
Come, mama.
Help me!
What are you doing with that?
No!
Please. Help!
No. No.
What are you gonna do with that?
What are you doing?
What are you gonna do?
Stop it!
How do I know your friend didn't hurt her?
Because I know Mike. He wouldn't hurt anybody.
You know what this town taught me?
Nobody knows anybody.
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?
There's always that one son of a bitch who doesn't realize that this is all for show.
It's not real.
I've been saying that all along.
How are we gonna find them?
We're gonna go back to the club. Start at the beginning, retrace their steps.
- No. I think we should call the cops.
- No.
People disappear off the Strip every night.
Police don't consider it a missing person till they've been gone a week.
Look, we're gonna find them.
There's no "we" here.
I just wanna find my friend.
You're still fucking hot.
You are dead fucking sexy.
Oh, shit.
Nasty little bitch.
Say "deep throat."
That's good. That's really good, babe.
That's nice work. What do you think?
Don't you think? Yeah, me too.
I'll see you.
Guys, guys. Hey.
- I got a text from Mike.
- What is he saying?
He says: "Sorry to disappear on you. Crashed all day."
- Where is he?
- Where's Nikki?
Hold on, I'm asking.
Where are you?
"I'm with Nikki.
She's sleeping. Battery dying."
Check it out.
God, Nikki, what did you do?
Hey, wait.
"Meet me here. Room 9, ASAP."
- Do you know where that is?
- Fremont district.
Okay, well, let's go kick his ass.
I'm gonna fucking kill him.
Are you coming, gimpy?
I think I'm gonna save myself for the Special Olympics.
My leg's killing me.
Go get that asshole and let's get out of here.
Hey, Mikey.
Mike, are you in there or what?
Mikey?
Nikki?
Well, at least we know they were here. This is Nikki's purse.
What the hell is he up to?
Here's his phone.
And a note.
"Guys, we stepped out.
Have a beer and chill."
At least we know he hasn't lost his manners.
Hey, Mikey?
So should we just wait here for them?
What if they don't come back?
I'm sorry this all got so fucked up.
As much as I'd love to have a moment, I'm just--
Oh, fuck.
What the fuck? Go, go.
No!
Hey. Whoa. What the fuck?
I'm sorry, man.
- You Justin?
- You scared the shit out of me.
I know. I'm really sorry about that, but Mike is looking for you.
- He's not in there?
- He's at a bar right down the street.
Too drunk to walk. He asked me to come get you.
Okay. He did?
Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, well, let me call him.
- Cool.
- One more thing.
- What--? Oh, fuck!
Bet you thought that was fucking hilarious, didn't you?
Look, you motherfuckers are making a mistake!
You're making a fucking mistake! You know that, don't you?
You have no fucking idea what you're doing!
Big fucking mistake!
- That's what they all say.
- Suck my dick, you faggot.
Where the fuck are we?
Who's doing this to us?
You're gonna meet them soon enough.
When it's your turn, they'll come for you.
Come here, you motherfuckers!
Hey! Hey!
Fucking tough guys!
Come over here!
Where is Anka?
I don't know what's going on. I don't-- Hey, no! No!
- No.
- Shit! Justin, Justin! Justin!
Why are they doing this to me?
What is going on here?
Where are you taking him?
That was your friend?
That was my friend. Who are you?
You should've said goodbye to him, then.
Hey! Hey!
Hey, you motherfucker, stop.
Stop. Come here.
- Wait your turn, ése.
- Yeah, it's my fucking turn right now.
What is that?
Shit, why didn't you say something?
Come on. Hurry up, let's go.
Back up. No.
Carter, what the fuck is going on? What is that all about?
It's Elite Hunting Club.
What the fuck does that mean?
It means members only.
What are you talking about? Where are you going?
Where the fuck are you going?
You can't leave me in here!
Carter!
Carter!
Get Mr. McMullin his Jack and Coke.
You can hold the Coke.
Accept my apologies for any inconvenience.
Inconvenience? That's what you call that?
Those guys were gonna drag me away like a piece of meat.
It must have been a unique sensation for you.
I'm glad to see you're enjoying this.
We are professionals.
There's a reason we kidnap people who won't be missed.
Your special request has caused more than a few inconveniences.
That was never my intention.
You know that. I'm a good client.
Top-tier client.
Which is why I entertained the idea in the first place.
Well, let's just agree that mistakes were made on both sides.
How do we move on?
The females will make up for the added expense.
And the others?
Your friends?
Collateral damage.
Do you have a problem with that?
If you do, I could call the home office.
They don't like to hear about problems.
They were always more his friends than mine.
So are we good?
Drink up.
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
That was a total of nine arrows until termination.
Congratulations to players five and 11.
Showtime.
I have big surprise for that cattle prod motherfucker.
What the fuck they doing to her?
They took my woman.
They took my Anka.
These fucking people.
Who knows what they're doing to her?
She was my life.
She was my everything.
I'm getting married next week.
Well, at least you didn't get married last week.
And why is that?
Because your woman would be a widow now.
Let's go, pretty boy.
Fuck you.
Oh, that wasn't a request.
Okay!
Scott!
Okay, okay!
Where the fuck are you taking him?
Fuck.
Come on, pretty boy. It's just a fucking jacket.
All right, all right, all right.
That's a nice tux.
Don't bother returning it.
Enjoy your honeymoon.
Welcome, members,
to the Elite Hunting Club's main event, a very special kill.
Enjoy the show.
- Don't get up. It's fine.
- What?
What is this?
What is this, Carter?
This? This is actually a really fucking cheap tuxedo.
I have this very special custom job I was gonna wear to the wedding.
Okay.
I guess now I'll wear it to your funeral.
What are you saying?
I didn't think they'd be able to find it, but they did. Recognize these?
This is really great.
Do you know what these are?
Those are the very expensive
German kitchen knives that Amy registered for at Bloomie's.
I'm glad they're here because I actually used a knife very much like this one to kill a girl at the club in Macau.
I skinned her alive.
It took me six hours.
What kind of sick fuck are you?
But the problem that I keep running into is that the rush just isn't there anymore.
I needed to up the ante a bit. I needed to kill someone who mattered.
How are you gonna get away with it?
You can't just make me disappear!
- That's what I pay these people for.
- What?
What, to kill your fucking friends?
Where are Mike and Justin?
- What did you do with them?
- That was actually a mistake.
That was a legitimate mistake.
That Mike was in the wrong place at exactly the right time.
And Justin...
The poor bastard. He didn't deserve it.
What, I deserve this?
Why do I deserve this?
Because you got what I want.
Amy.
This is all about Amy?
I thought when she found out that you cheated on her she would leave you right away.
You told her.
You told her. You fucking...
She is going to be devastated when she finds out.
You sick fuck.
But that's okay, I will be right there next to her to console her.
You sick fuck.
- You sick fuck!
-And how long do you think it'll be
- before I'm fucking her?
- You sick fuck!
In your own goddamn bed.
Don't you touch her! I'll fucking kill you! I will fucking kill you.
What kind of man are you? You do this to your fucking friends?
When it comes to pussy,
I have no friends.
You motherfuckers want a show?
- I'll give you a fucking show.
- Go ahead.
Yeah!
Let him go.
Yeah!
You motherfuckers want a show?
I'll give you a fucking show!
The house always wins.
The honeymoon isn't quite over yet, Elite Hunting Club members.
Now, who wants to bid on killing the groom?
Get me the fuck out of here, you motherfuckers!
You sick fucks!
Come on! Come to me, you motherfucker.
- Shut your mouth or I'll fuck you up!
- Come to me.
My turn now! You motherfucker!
Give me that!
I'm so fucking happy.
You die, tough guy. It's your turn.
Die, motherfucker!
Die, you piece of shit!
You motherfucker!
You fucking die.
Now I fuck your mother, okay?
Fuck!
No!
Die, motherfucker!
Take that, you fucking bitch!
Come on, motherfuckers!
I repeat, we have two escaped prisoners on the loose.
Okay.
Sir, we have two on the loose.
- Have security round them up.
- Yes, sir.
Sound the alarm.
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, God.
Oh, please. Please, please, please.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Fuck!
- That mother--
- Fucking shit!
Shit!
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, God, please.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Please, please, please.
Oh, God, please.
911 operator, what is your emergency?
Yes, I need help.
They're killing people.
What is your location, sir?
Look, I don't know where I am.
- That's okay, sir.
- Oh, wait, wait.
- Please wait.
- Stay on the line. Stay calm.
- They've killed my friends.
- Killed your friends.
Hurry. They're gonna kill me.
Remain calm, sir. Stay on the line.
I see dead people.
We've got a point of location.
The police are on their way.
Fuck!
My friends, please, keep your seats.
We are experiencing a temporary power interruption.
As a safety precaution, you will be escorted to your vehicles.
Yeah. Tennessee tuxedo called the cops.
We've been compromised.
That's it, we're shutting down.
Kill the prisoners?
Kill them all.
No witnesses.
Help me, please. Please, help.
Please, don't! Please!
Oh, God.
- Scott. Scott.
- Keys.
- Oh, God. Okay.
- Get me out.
- Hurry.
- Fuck!
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Fuck! Shit!
One way out of here, motherfucker.
Why the hurry?
- The place is gonna blow.
- Yeah?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, Jesus.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Okay.
Fuck you!
Die!
Fuck you.
No! Wait!
You motherfucker!
You motherfucker, come here! Come-- Wa--
No!
Fuck!
I can't believe he's gone.
I just-- I feel like none of this would have happened if I hadn't take him to Vegas.
Don't talk like that.
Hell, at least, you survived.
It's okay.
You can cry.
Carter?
Yeah?
I don't wanna be alone tonight.
You don't have to be, Amy.
I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.
I need a drink.
- Would you like a drink?
- Yeah.
I would love a drink. Yeah.
Okay.
- Can I help you with that?
- No.
I got it.
Problem is... he's alive.
What do you say we finish that bachelor party?
Amy, please help me.
The house always wins.
RAMMBOCK: BERLIN UNDEAD (2010)
I wanted to bring back your keys.
You wanted your keys back.
I wanted to come in person.
You're not glad?
You can't just move out after 7 years like it's nothing!
Gabi.
Gabi, please! I...
Gabi, I love you!
No, it's too late for that.
You're getting worked up.
You're not a good Gabi.
I don't know Gabi, but believe me, getting worked up won't help.
Hallo!
Good mood!
Here you go!
And don't reproach her!
It's your only chance.
And if I let myself in?
I'll surprise her with a good mood.
Oh no, don't do that.
You'd better call before going over.
At least use the doorbell.
Want to give it another go?
No, I think I got it. Thanks.
Good. Then see you soon.
See you. Thanks for the lift.
My pleasure.
Don't get worked up!
Gabi?
Gabi?
Excuse me.
I'm looking for
Gabi Haruther, she lives here.
I'm her boyfriend.
Do you know where she is?
Hello?
Hi, you've reached Gabi.
Leave a message after the beep.
Hi Gabi, it's Michi.
I've got a surprise.
I'm in Berlin.
At yours.
Just so you know.
Ok, see you in a minute.
Gabi?
Pardon, do you know where Ms Haruther is?
What's wrong, boss?
Stop it!
My mobile!
We've got to call the police.
Is there a landline here?
- What's...
What's the matter?
What's with him?
No idea.
Get lost copper!
Get back!
Stay away from me!
Hello, hey!
What's with you?
Help! Help!
Semra!
Help me!
Semra, I can't get out!
Listen. What did Gabi say to you?
What?
- The woman who lives here!
Listen!
"Be right back".
When did she leave?
- Just before you arrived.
Maybe she...
Was she wearing a jacket?
Don't think so.
Maybe she's in the cellar.
Was she doing a wash?
- No!
Maybe she went to the roof.
It's her!
Let me go! It's Gabi!
That had to be Gabi.
She was worried about me.
How's the TV work?
Video to AV.
We are interrupting our programming for a special...
I'm Michael.
Harper.
..reports of violence leading to injury and death.
We are now speaking with a police spokesman.
Mr Brabant, is this the German
September 11th?
Such ridiculous speculation is really only a waste of time.
Right now, we have to prevent further harm.
The public is being asked to stay in their homes, until further notice.
Mr Brabant, there are reports of injured suffering bite wounds.
Bite wounds from people.
Like rabies or something.
Can the police really be prepared?
The Berlin police are prepared for such cases, and will subdue the situation quickly.
Lock your doors, keep radios and TVs on and wait for help from the authorities.
Remain calm.
Do not leave your homes to look for friends or family.
Help each other, but don't take unnecessary risks.
Thank you, Mr Brabant.
The police insist...
Want a coffee?
..upon staying inside.
Or a water?
Lockdown in Berlin.
Please keep your TVs on.
It can be seen how seriously the authorities are taking this situation.
Bless you.
- Thanks.
The question must be asked:
Is this unrest even politically motivated?
Not to speculate, but it doesn't look...
What's that?
The people who are creating the violence don't seem to have political leanings.
And their methods don't seem in any recognizable way to be organized.
But, I repeat, for the moment, all we can do is speculate.
The only certainty is that hospital emergency rooms in Berlin are overflowing at this time with the injured.
And that by far most of the injuries are bite wounds.
Doctors report that patients develop changes, in response to the illness, to the skin and eyes.
We've seen that these people attack out of uncontrolled anger, and bite other people.
Flüfli?
Do you know where Gabi is?
Morning.
We're only getting test screens.
Can't be.
Today of all days.
Got a radio?
Gabi's got one in the kitchen.
I'm gonna get dressed.
Clear out.
- Excuse me?
The door to the loo is blocked.
You can't just piss on the dishes, no way!
Hey!
Nobody's there.
We've got to close the gate!
Listen up!
We've got to close the gate!
Why doesn't he do it?
What's-his-name, the guy with tattoos!
- Manfred.
He's called Manni!
He has to do it. Manni!
Manni?
Manni, come to the window!
Be quiet!
I'll do it.
What?
- I'll do it.
Thorsten, no!
Is he out?
Can you see my brother?
She should be quiet or they'll come.
Thorsten!
- Quiet! Be quiet!
Look out!
The gate!
Behind you!
Come back!
Parliament has authorized the immediate use of military force.
State of emergency has been declared according to Article 35 of the constitution.
It is now clear that a pervasive epidemic is spreading via a virus of unknown origin.
The pathogen is transmitted by bodily fluids via bites and bleeding wounds.
Within minutes or hours, the virus spreads through the body.
Infection does not mean a full blown illness.
The pathogen only enters the brain when the body releases adrenaline.
I repeat, adrenaline released under strong emotional stress activates the illness.
If you think you may be infected, it is very important to stay calm.
Stay away from others.
If possible, sedate yourself.
There are indications that the immune system can conquer the disease if the illness remains dormant.
If illness develops, seek safety away from the infected person.
Under no circumstances should one attract their attention, even if they are family members or friends.
Remain calm.
If you are in an urban area do not try to leave on your own.
All major traffic routes have been blocked.
The army is preparing to evacuate large cities via waterways.
Stay in a safe place.
Barricade your doors and windows.
Keep your radios on.
Ladies and gentlemen, the German parliament has authorized immediate...
They're starting over?
Infinite loop.
Is nobody at the station?
The mobile network is down too.
Do you hear that?
I heard it last night.
Is it morse code?
What are you making?
A slingshot.
And the forks?
- Ammunition.
Not with Gabi's forks!
Buy some new ones.
And when she comes back and sees this?
No way!
You really think that?
You really think she'll show up and get upset about the forks?
Yes, I do!
If I didn't believe that,
I'd hang myself.
Your breath stinks.
I'm hungry.
You see? The phone works.
My battery's gonna die.
What are these for?
Shooting eyes.
Throat. Jugular vein.
You can't do that.
They're still people!
Help me to get my mobile.
Then we can open the loo door.
To the bedroom!
Grab the armoire!
Gabi!
- Hi Michi!
Georg.
- Who were you expecting?
You ok? Where are you?
Georg... Yeah, I'm safe.
Have you heard from Gabi?
- Definitely not.
I'm not in Berlin.
You're in Berlin, because of her, dummy!
Yeah, what's the situation there?
Totally crazy.
They're out to bite...
Yeah, that's...
Look Michi, you have to somehow get back to Kitzstern.
- Good idea
We're safe in the firehouse.
Listen, you gotta...
I gotta go in case Gabi calls.
Michi, don't hang up!
Mama?
- Hello, this is Ina Müller's voicemail.
Please leave a message and I will call you back.
Voicemail.
Yeah, it's me.
I hope you're ok.
Well...
Bye.
We can't get to the loo either.
Flüfli's litter is extra-absorbent.
And where do we take a shit?
There's nothing to shit, we've got nothing to eat.
What is that?
- A ship.
At Westhafen, that's near here.
Listen up, it's important.
My wife is infected.
Quiet!
I need help. I've got sedatives but only a day's worth.
Do you have any sedatives?
I would know if Gabi had some.
I know where some are.
Where?
- Next-door to them.
Bramkamp is her name.
Bramkamp is her name.
She's addicted.
Her stomach has to be pumped once a month!
Her brother is a pharmacist.
He gets them for her.
Can you get out?
No way.
Please, somehow.
You hungry?
Do you have anything to eat?
Do you?
Loads! You can have it if you help.
We'll send it over with a rope.
Harper?
You thinking about your parents?
- Go to bed.
Do you want the bear suit?
Go to bed, man!
What is it?
You're hungry, aren't you?
Sounds funny, but I always wanted to do this.
Wait.
Let's go.
Go, go!
Forgive us our sins...
Our Father in heaven...
- Good morning.
You must be Mrs Bramkamp.
Sorry about the wall.
But you've seen what's happening.
Harper!
The pills!
Go on up!
Michi?
Gabi?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to bring back your keys.
What?
You wanted your keys back.
Yeah, but via the post.
I wanted to come in person.
You're not pleased?
Yes, I am.
I lost the keys.
But the door is broken anyway.
You're alive, that's all that matters.
He's injured.
Michi, were you bitten?
No, I scratched myself.
You were scratched!
I had to break through the wall for sedatives.
- Good idea.
We have sedatives.
Kai will get you some.
Gabi, who's that?
Kai, Mrs Bramkamp's son.
He asked me to come because she broke down then she changed.
And then...
We came up here.
Now first, you take one of these.
Are you with him...
Is that why you broke up?
Michi, don't get worked up.
I'm not with him, and I didn't want to break up.
I only want you.
Please, take a pill.
How long?
Don't get upset.
A couple of weeks.
Shortly after I moved in.
Long distance!
You say you need it for your job and future.
I came from Vienna to show you I care for this?
Michi, I didn't tell you so as not to hurt you.
Take the pills!
- They're not for me!
Get down!
Gabi!
- Let me.
Down!
Let go.
Back down there!
Leave it!
Michi, the roof.
Not without you, Gabi.
- Just go!
I'm here with the pills!
Open up.
I've got the pills.
Open up!
Open up!
Sorry, I couldn't get more.
Thanks.
Cherie! Look here.
I've got more pills.
Look.
I need a new bandage.
In a moment, first the pills.
What was that noise?
It was nothing.
Please, take a pill.
I thought we didn't have any more.
- Oh yes.
I found some more.
That's right.
That's right.
It's only a glass.
- I want...
Don't touch me!
Out of the way.
Put it down!
Come on!
That's it?
He didn't have more food than that?
He exaggerated a bit.
- It worked.
Thanks, by the way.
You cold?
Here.
Thanks.
Now what?
Let's eat something.
Here?
Here's the break.
- It's strong enough?
We'll have to see...
I found this upstairs.
What made you think to use the flash?
By accident.
Their retinas are sensitive.
I hope it really hurts.
Yeah, really bad.
How did you make it?
I was, er, in the attic.
Went over the roof.
And the pills?
I found them in the kitchen. By luck.
I know a way how we can maybe get there.
I saw a boat.
I was going to sell that on the net.
About 800 meters.
We each take a camera and run.
Two shoot forwards, two backwards.
Then to the port by boat.
They can't swim.
I'm pretty sure.
What kind of boat is it?
A little one.
A two-seater.
What?
Worst case we'll take turns swimming and paddling.
That's suicide!
Two too many!
We'll have to draw straws.
- You an idiot?
It's all or none.
- Then no one!
Otherwise, we'll all die!
What's going on?
Lights!
Keep cool.
- Keep cool?
Torches!
Hurry, turn on the torches!
I want to do it.
I want out of here.
Me too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tomorrow morning.
Ulf is gone!
He's got the cameras.
He's abandoning us!
Stop!
Harper, no! Harper!
I got the camera.
Thanks you.
Don't touch me!
No!
We gotta hurry.
I put this one here.
Click here.
Click that one over here.
I set it on multishot.
It'll flash a few times in a row.
This one you'll have to hold.
There's the button to flash.
Get going.
Get a move on!
Here's the camera.
Hurry! Go!
Let me go, mom!
Gabi!
Good luck is a birdie, so dear but so shy; so hard to get hold of, so easy to fly.
Your heart is the bird-cage, so see that you care, or you'll find no peace and no rest anywhere.
My ears hear what others cannot hear.
Small, faraway things people cannot normally see are visible to me.
These senses are the fruits of a lifetime of longing.
Longing to be rescued.
To be completed.
Just as the skirt needs the wind to billow...
...I'm not formed by things that are of myself alone.
I wear my father's belt tied around my mother's blouse.
And shoes which are from my uncle.
This is me.
Just as a flower does not choose its color...
...we are not responsible for what we have come to be.
Only once you realize this do you become free.
And to become adult...
...is to become free.
Richard! No!
A family man...
...devoted husband to his wife, Evelyn...
...loving father to his daughter, India.
He was a model to our town...
...and of what it means to be a man who walks through the world...
...with openness, honesty and integrity.
- India?
- Richard Stoker was taken from us...
...by a cruel twist of fate.
India?
The reasons for which are unknown and unknowable.
By an accident nobody would have predicted.
It would have been impossible for even an outstanding architect...
...like Richard...
...to understand God's great design.
India?
India.
The guests will be here soon.
Can you help
Mrs. McGarrick in the kitchen?
Please?
Don't do this to me, India.
Not today.
When they pried open his car...
- ...you know, his body was burned...
- To a crisp.
Terrible accident.
Poor thing.
India was so close to her father.
- Who's gonna look after her?
- She's still got her mother.
Her mother look after her?
Heh. More like the other way around.
You know what?
This whole accident is so strange.
Have you heard all the rumors floating around...?
You don't think he meant to drive off the bridge?
- Why did he have to go two states away?
- I don't know.
- Everything all right?
- Uh, yes, Mrs. McGarrick.
Now I'm wondering if I kept them in the fridge too long.
What do you think?
Was I too stingy with the paprika?
Mm? Ha, ha.
Your deviled eggs remind me of when I was a little girl.
Well, you may be all grown up, but you still get eggshells all over the floor.
Have you outgrown your shoes?
Did you find your birthday present yet?
I found the box, but it was empty.
Are you sure?
Did you check?
Check again.
Every year I thought it was my father who left me shoes on my birthday.
But all this time, it's been...
Tell me what it opens.
How would I know?
All right.
That was my brother...
You know, originally they were part of a set of four...
...but then I broke one as a kid.
Now I'm seeing in this house someone must have let another break.
Unh. No, it wasn't me.
When we, uh... When we moved in, it broke as the housekeepers were unpacking it.
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.
India. Come and say hello to your Uncle Charlie.
India? Come over.
See you soon.
Hello, India.
Come on.
She hates to be touched. Heh.
I'm her mother.
What a curse, hm?
You know, Charlie, Richard used to say...
...that we had lost you to the rest of the world forever.
Why, India, you're white as a sheet.
Is something wrong?
Yes.
My father is dead.
How beautiful.
Richard was so proud of India's hunting that he stuffed every single thing she killed.
What a tragic waste of life.
These live particularly deep in the forest.
They'd be very hard to catch.
I guess Richard and India were a good team.
Oh.
It's kind of disrespectful, him not wearing black to his own brother's funeral.
He must have come back today from the Middle East or something.
It's just part of a dig in some old part of Istanbul?
No, I think he was digging for something quite different. Gold in Indonesia.
I really want to thank you for your words this morning.
- Well, you and Richard deserve every word.
- Oh.
The wine's good.
There you are. Come and join us.
This is Richard's brother.
Hello.
- He's back.
- Nice to meet you.
These are the Blooms, good friends of ours.
Good evening.
I didn't know Richard had a brother.
Nice to meet you.
We're sorry for your loss.
How did you know Richard?
Got his doctorate from Oxford when he was 24.
Stoker sure had the brains.
Yeah. Just look at India.
Hello, again.
Do you want to know why you feel at a disadvantage right now?
Because I didn't know you existed until today?
Because you're standing below me.
You look like my father.
I am so sorry.
It's your loss too.
Oh, um...
In about 60 seconds, your mother's gonna tell you...
...that I'm gonna be staying here for a while...
...but I want it to be your decision too.
Why?
Because...
...it's important to me.
This really is a beautiful garden.
The soil...
...is so soft.
Good for digging.
I'm not exactly sure what you're driving at.
I don't want any trouble.
I am the only one who would know anything about it.
I did everything you asked of me.
I kept you informed every year.
I was your eyes, your ears, your hands all this time.
You're acting like you're in diapers now...
...and you've done this to me ever since you were a child. I'm tired of it.
- I am tired of it.
- All right.
Mrs. McGarrick?
Mrs. McGarrick?
Where is she?
I haven't seen her yet.
Good morning.
It's afternoon.
Oh. I guess it is.
Do you think you could...?
That's my girl. Thank you.
Mm.
What are you doing today?
Thought I'd...
...draw the curtains, stop the clocks...
...cover the mirrors and then retire to my room.
Don't be morbid.
Get rid of that dress. What is that?
It's my mourning attire.
Why don't we get out of here, hm?
Go shopping.
We could get some ice cream.
In Victorian times, a widow was expected to mourn her husband for two years.
At least.
- India.
- But in Ancient China...
...they built a straw hut beside the grave and lived there for three years doing nothing.
You and me, ice cream, fresh air.
Come on, all these years of hunting trips with him...
...and all I'm asking for is one afternoon with me.
That's what your father would have wanted.
You know, your father and I weren't always so distant.
I miss when he was...
...young.
India!
India!
Mature aroma.
You chose a good year.
You can't compare it to a younger wine.
Too tannic.
Not ready to be open.
You should have come with us, India.
Oh, the open top...
...the air. It felt so good.
We stopped and Uncle Charlie got some ice cream for you.
One chocolate, one vanilla.
Did I get it right?
I like the swirl kind.
Oh. You can make the swirl yourself, you lazy thing.
Where's Mrs. McGarrick?
She's still not here.
What? What are we supposed to do?
I'm not much in the kitchen.
I can cook a little.
No, you don't have to do that.
I'd love to.
Charlie, who in the world are you?
India, would you take these down to the freezer, please?
Do as your uncle tells you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, India.
Too cold down there?
No.
You know, there was a time...
...Richard used to cook meals like this.
Ahem.
Wasn't there, India?
Oh. Phew. I'm sorry, of course.
That was before you were born.
Where did you learn to cook like this,
Charlie?
Madame Jacquin.
She ran a Michelin-starred restaurant outside of Toulouse called "L'Institution."
- Hm. A female chef.
- Mm.
In her opinion, there was nothing a man could master...
...that a woman couldn't make.
What do you mean?
It sounds better in French.
Did I tell you on the way home?
Your French accent is perfect.
One of the perks of a first-class education.
Heh.
I could stay locked up in this house for the rest of my life...
...yet still speak impeccable French. Heh.
I know you're not gonna spend the rest of your life locked up in this house.
How do you spend your days?
I want to know my brother's wife.
Oh, I don't know where to start. Ha, ha.
Charlie, you didn't even touch your food.
Did you put poison in the food just for us girls?
But India ate everything.
Practically licked it clean.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Now, can I get you anything else?
Maybe some ice cream?
No.
"No, thank you."
I mean, no, thank you.
Would you like to play something for us after dinner?
I don't think so.
Would you?
India.
I mean, no, thank you.
Why didn't you tell me I had an uncle?
Because I barely knew about Charlie myself.
I mean, he's been traveling the world for as long as I've known your father.
You know, he used to say to me:
"What kind of family is family that never comes home?"
Let's stop talking about Richard. Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
The year you were born.
What do you want from me?
To be friends.
We don't need to be friends.
We're family.
It takes time to observe attentively.
Wait for the moment that our eyes...
...finally penetrate the inside of the subject.
Look, Marv...
...see that flower?
The way it just hangs there?
My eyes are penetrating the inside of you.
Observe carefully and you'll note that this plant...
Check out Pitts.
I want you to really...
Hey.
- Pitts.
- Yes, Mr. Feldman? ls there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?
Yeah, I've got something I'd like to share.
With India.
He's gorgeous.
Hey.
Come back.
Mom?
It's going to rain.
Mm. Relax.
There.
Curl your fingers.
No.
Watch me. You see?
Oh.
I'm teaching him piano.
Uncle Charlie is a complete beginner.
Put on some dry clothes and come play with us.
Why don't you take a hot shower first or you'll catch a cold. Come on. Here.
Good morning, sweetie.
Charlie cleared off the court yesterday.
So we're just gonna walk on over.
You don't want to come, do you?
Hello, India.
I took one of Richard's belts.
- His whites are a little big.
- Mm.
Ready?
Let's go.
India?
Oh.
It's me.
Come and give your Auntie Gin a hug.
- What time did you get in, Gwendolyn?
- Around 4.
Mm. That's right.
And when do you fly out?
That remains to be seen.
I'd originally planned to stay for only a day or two...
...but now I'm thinking
I should stay a bit longer.
Spend a little quality time with India.
Hm. How nice for her.
- Charles?
- Auntie Gin.
How long have you been here?
Not long.
We're so grateful that he's taken time away from his commitments in Europe.
- Europe?
- Yes.
Evie, dear, after dinner,
I was thinking perhaps you and I could talk.
- We are talking.
- Alone.
- About what?
- Like Richard, for instance.
- Richard?
- Yes, Evie. Richard.
My nephew, your late husband.
I don't think I'll be forgetting his name any time soon.
Of course not. I just thought there might be arrangements to be made.
Things to be settled.
Our lawyer has said none of this has anything to do with you. You're not in the will.
No, dear, I mean something entirely different.
Like, for example...
...maybe we could talk about your living here with Charlie like this.
Auntie Gin isn't shy when it comes to expressing her opinions about me.
Like when Richard asked me to marry him.
What Auntie Gin might be surprised...
...to learn is that those opinions are neither wanted, needed, or appreciated.
- Evie...
- You come into my home and attack me...
...at a time like this.
Evie...
I'm sure Auntie Gin didn't mean anything.
You didn't mean anything by it, did you?
No.
No, of course not, Evie dear.
Now, would either of you two like to play something for us after dinner?
No, thank you.
Good night, Auntie Gin.
Don't mind Evie. She’s just tired. Oh, um...
What was the name of your hotel again?
- The Biltmore.
- The Biltmore.
Maybe we could have breakfast together.
- Just us girls.
- Oh, I'm not sure.
Can you take her to the Biltmore Hotel?
I'll probably have a headache in the morning.
- Drive carefully.
- Auntie Gin, stay the night here.
Oh.
You made the evening much nicer.
Oh, thank you, dear.
But an old woman needs time on her own to recover. Good night, sweet child.
Call me.
Are there any other hotels in town besides the Biltmore?
Even family ties have no meaning when food is scarce.
This one knows there is no room for his brother in the hunt.
While this sibling rivalry may seem cruel, in the end, it is for the best.
Each day in the hunt brings the eagle closer to maturity.
...and chicks of his own.
The most patient of predators, the black eagle can circle for hours...
...waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
The fish will provide much needed nourishment for her growing chicks.
I was wondering if anyone had turned in a cell phone.
I think I may have dropped it when I was checking in.
Are you absolutely certain?
All right. Oh, wait, wait. Um, what number do I have to press to dial out?
Nine. Yes, I thought so.
Oh. Come on.
The mountains are no place for the faint of heart.
The steep terrain and harsh climate make a challenging climate...
...for even the strongest of species.
...wings are freedom.
...while the eagle prefers to find its own meals, there is nothing wrong in having a little help.
Any advantage in nature is to be appreciated, and what the left...
...a hearty meal for the hungry bird who lived to hunt another day.
...thirteen pounds and a wingspan of nearly 7 feet.
You said you were staying at the Biltmore Hotel...
...and yet, here you are.
I even had to call the cab company.
...prey does hot suspect the hunter is circling high above...
...and is taken completely by surprise.
Oh.
- Hey, yo, yo. Look who's here.
- No kidding?
- Is it...? Is it true?
- Is it?
Yo, check this out.
- I'm telling you, she can talk, bro.
- Well, let's find out.
- Oh, creepy, man.
- All right, shh, shh.
Hey, Stoker.
Uh-oh. Ooh.
Mm-mm.
- Hey, Stoker.
- Where you going?
I'm talking to you.
Or do you go by Stroker now?
Because I hear that's what your mom's been doing...
...to your uncle.
You been getting in on that?
- What did you say?
- Ooh!
- She speaks.
- "What did you say?"
I think you heard me, Stroker.
Say that again?
Uh-oh.
- Oh!
All right. I think you'd better watch your step, Stroker.
You know what happens to little girls who mess with me?
Watch this.
What's up, bitch?
- What's up?
- Ooh.
- Hey, come here, you all right?
- Oh, my God.
You okay?
All right, Pitts. That's enough.
Get out of here, Whip.
Follow the bouncing ball, jackass.
She's not interested.
Dude, let's just go.
Yeah, like I enjoy wasting my time on this bitch, anyways. Let's go.
- Freak.
- Sorry about that.
He's an A-hole, okay? Just ignore him.
Hey.
Where you going?
Too cold down there?
India, would you take these down to the freezer, please?
That I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs
And said let's pass some time
And I will give to you
Summer wine
Oh, summer wine
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really
Made from all these things
You stayed longer than I thought you would.
You probably need to move on.
And I will give to you
Summer wine
You want me to leave?
My eyes grew heavy
Come on.
You could return to Madame Jacquin.
But I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me
With an unfamiliar line
Dance with me.
And then she gave to me
I always end up leading.
Well then, lead me, Evie.
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really
Made from all these things
You know...
...for me...
...it doesn't matter who you are.
I feel the same.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
It doesn't matter who I am for me, either.
When I woke up
The sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone
My head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs
A dollar and a dime
And left me cravin' for
More summer wine
Oh, summer wine
Oh, summer wine
Whip.
Hey.
I just thought I...
I've never been here before.
Yeah, no kidding.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Have fun, bro.
So...
You wanna go inside?
Then where would you like to go?
India Stoker,
Middlebend straight-A student...
...hanging out in the parking lot at Rockets?
Doesn't really seem like you.
Not that you would know.
Well, I... I guess you're right. I wouldn't.
It's just that, um...
Yes.
I know what you mean.
Oh. yeah?
How's that?
Have you ever seen a photograph of yourself...
...taken when you didn't know you're being photographed?
From an angle you don't get to see when you look in the mirror.
And you think, "That's me.
That's also me."
Do you...?
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Yeah. I think I do.
Well...
...that's how I feel tonight.
So you're surprised at yourself?
You're not afraid of being touched anymore?
Please don't spoil it.
Holy shit.
Everyone said you were crazy.
But they have no idea, do they?
I wanna go home now.
Let me go.
No, you don't.
You opened this door, and now you're gonna walk through it.
- Shh!
- Oh...
Quiet.
Hold still.
This is not gonna hurt.
Shit, what...?
Unh! Ow! Oh, ow!
Stop, stop, stop.
I broke my... Ow.
Glad I borrowed your dad's belt.
Mine would've been way too short.
- Ow. Shit...
- All yours.
- I'm seriously hurt. Shit.
- Shut up.
Ow. Ow!
India, stop. Ow. Ow.
India. Ow. Unh!
Stop. Stop.
- Aah. Unh!
- I'll kill you.
I don't give a fuck...
Strawberries, cherries
Yes?
Can I come in?
Well, what time is it?
Would you brush my hair?
I was just going to bed.
Then I'll brush yours.
You're wearing the nightgown I bought you.
Tonight I felt like wearing something silk.
Now that I think about it,
I never brushed your hair...
...did I?
You were busy.
With what?
I don't know.
You and your father were always on your hunting trips.
How could I compete with all of those dead birds you constantly brought home?
She reassured me
With an unfamiliar-
I saw you in the dining room today.
I don't know what you think you saw...
...but nothing happened.
You were so still,
I never even heard you there.
Dad taught me that.
Hunting.
To wait.
In silence.
We wouldn't need food or drink.
We would watch everything.
The patterns of tree branches spreading out...
...the thousands of shapes clouds make.
I could count the number of leaves on a tree in five hours.
I always thought Dad liked hunting.
But tonight I realized he did it for me.
He used to say, "Sometimes you need to do something bad...
...to stop you from doing something worse."
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go to the hairdresser...
...after I clean out your father's study.
Dear India, happy birthday.
You are 5 years old today.
I wish I could be there for your party...
...but your uncle is far away in Africa taking pictures for the magazine.
Dearest India, I'm writing this letter to you from Florence.
Yesterday, I circled Michelangelo's David for hours. He carries a sling.
His belted weapon over his left shoulder.
- You are my dearest and only niece.
- My silent and invisible partner.
And these are the lessons for you in our many chapters together.
- Dear India.
- Happy birthday again.
I've missed your first teeth coming out.
I'll never see the holes in your smile...
...or how they will fill in as you mature into a young lady.
Greetings from Saint-Ètienne, where everyone I meet insists on kissing both cheeks.
This custom of hugging and kissing.
I think you, too, would find this uncomfortable.
If I found it was you in an embrace,
I could make an exception.
- I wonder if you would, too.
- Happy Valentine's.
- Happy Halloween.
- Merry Christmas.
- Though I never receive a letter...
- I see your messages in the stars.
Or in the music I hear.
It is a whistling tune from a lonely man wandering in a foreign land.
I sense things so acutely until it becomes almost too much.
I wonder if for you, too, life is made difficult by...
The fact that you can hear what others cannot hear, see what they cannot see.
I know that someday you'll be very special, India, and you already are.
- I know inside you feel some loneliness.
- Because you are the only one.
Please know that I am with you as we share the same blood.
Tonight, I'll fall asleep as I try to imagine...
...that you'll grow up and take over our name.
How I want to meet you.
- All my love, Charlie.
- All my love, Charlie.
You've reached the Middlebend
Sheriff's Department non-emergency number.
If this is an emergency, please hang up and dial 911.
Otherwise, please hold for the next available operator.
Middlebend Sheriff's Department, how may I help you?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
My father had the exact same sunglasses.
He wore them only when he was driving so they were always in the glove compartment.
Now I suppose they're all melted up, along with the rest of the car.
Please leave before my mother wakes up.
Aren't you curious about what happened to Richard?
I'm curious about what happened to Jonathan.
That's an inseparable part of what happened to Richard.
Richard was completely taken with Jonathan.
That summer, Jonathan had just learned how to climb the stairs.
Let's go again. Let's go.
He couldn't resist climbing any staircase he came across.
It's been 20 years since your family donated this building to Crawford.
It may look old now, but Charlie's room is still very comfortable.
As you know, he was the one who wanted to stay here.
And he insisted on being discharged on this day.
Today.
Welcome to my home.
Away from home.
Until we meet again.
I'm so proud of you.
It always was your favorite car.
I think you're gonna love New York.
I got you your own apartment.
You see?
Aren't we going to your house?
Everything you need is in here.
Why aren't we going to your place?
I'm not gonna see India?
Here are the keys.
I think you'll see that I've taken care of all the details.
Why are you doing this to me?
Do I really have to tell you something you already know?
Why can't I go?
Charlie.
Why not?
Tell me.
You listen very carefully.
This is the most important thing.
- If anything happens, you must call...
- You still love me, don't you, Richie?
Yes, of course, I love you, Charlie.
I just have to love you a little less now.
I can't have you...
Near my India, my family.
And I said:
But I'm your family.
What kind of family is family you can't take home?
- Jesus.
- Excuse me.
Jesus, Charlie.
Are you okay?
I'm fine, Richie.
I'm fine now.
Thank you for asking.
Charlie?
Unh. Oh, Charlie.
Of course, I still love you, Richard.
I just have to love you a little bit less now.
Why now?
Why come back now?
The day I left Crawford...
...the day your father had his accident...
...what day was it, do you remember?
Yes.
I remember.
What day was it?
It was my 18th birthday.
I was waiting.
For you.
Everything I've ever done.
For you, India.
Happy birthday, India.
Yes, sheriff.
I was hungry, so I stopped by Rockets for some fries.
I bumped into Whip at the parking lot and we decided to go for a walk.
At night? Those woods are dangerous.
Oh, I wasn't scared.
Not with Whip there.
He's so strong.
I see.
So we had a very nice time.
And then?
And then I went home.
I thought Whip said he was heading home too.
Any idea what time that was?
Well, that was, uh...
When did you eat the fries?
Excuse me?
Well, you said you went there because you were hungry? Uh...
And then, that is, after having a nice time, you would have become even more hungry...
...and if you went to eat some fries...
...I could find some people that can remember what time they saw you.
I think I, um..
I think I must have been...
I must have been blushing.
It was my first time outside with a boy.
I didn't want to be seen.
It was 8:30 when you came home.
II Trovatore was playing on PBS.
Yeah, when I came home, my uncle was watching TV...
...so I watched it with him.
Um, just one moment.
II Trovatore.
What is it? It's a foreign movie?
No. No, it's an opera by Verdi.
- Would you like me to write it down?
- I'm fine.
I do hope Whip's okay.
Well, his folks are a mess.
Then again, I have a feeling that he'll turn up.
Boys that age...
Well, you know how they are.
- I'm sure I do.
- Heh.
You will let me know if you hear anything, won't you?
Will do.
Okay.
Well, I'll be in touch.
Goodbye, sheriff.
Goodbye, sheriff.
Oh.
Oh, by the way, did your housekeeper ever get in touch after leaving town so quick?
No.
She didn't.
Strange how people can just disappear on you.
He'll be back.
What are we going to do?
I think we'll really love New York.
When do we leave?
I'm sorry.
Tomorrow night.
- Should we do it again?
- I'm hungry. Let's eat first.
You know, I've often wondered why it is we have children in the first place.
And the conclusion I've come to is...
...at some point in our lives, we realize things are...
They're screwed up beyond repair.
So we decide to start again.
Wipe the slate clean.
Start afresh.
And we have children.
Little carbon copies we can turn to and say,
"You will do what I could not.
You will succeed where I have failed."
Because we want someone to get it right this time.
But not me.
Personally speaking,
I can't wait to watch life tear you apart.
India...
...who are you?
You were supposed to love me, weren't you?
Come up to my room, please.
I enjoyed your performance.
India, go and pack a small bag.
We'll be leaving shortly.
I, uh...
I came to say goodbye.
I can't allow you to do this.
Why not?
There are little things one notices along the way, but one suppresses because...
Because?
Why do you think?
Love?
Richard loved India.
He would never have driven so far away on her birthday.
Not unless, for some reason he was called away by someone he couldn't say no to.
Auntie Gin wanted to speak to me about you...
...but she never did come back after that night, did she?
People disappear...
...all the time.
Have me instead, but stay away from my daughter.
She's of age.
Of age for what?
To live in this house on her own while her mother finally travels the world.
Don't you want to speak French in France?
What are you suggesting?
Come with me.
India.
India, come here and look.
India, come here.
India! Come here! Now!
In a hurry?
Know how fast you were going?
Pardon?
Effectively fast, Mister Sheriff.
Effective for what?
To get your attention.
I became the color
I became the daughter and the son
When the feast is over
Welcome to another one
I lay my body down, down
Down upon the water
Wrapped up in the clothes
Of my mother and my father
Oh, this is longing
I wanna be complete
I was waiting around in a little jump seat
I had hunger, a mouthful of M&Ms
You'd do anything just to get rescued
I had longing, isn't it the key?
Take take
Taste taste taste sweet
They said I'd gone south
Said I'd gone asunder
I was just free
We were ready to behave
But there's no freedom without no key
Whatever you think you'll become
All that matters, dear
Is where you're coming from
Oh, no, no, take me from my misery
There's no such thing as living comfortably
There's no such thing as going home
I'm not formed of myself alone
All the other others, they just fade to black
When you think you have me's
When I don't look back
Keep on laughing, calling after me
Keep on laughing, I'm just free
We were ready to behave
But there's no freedom without no key
Whatever you think you'll become
All that matters, dear
Is where you're coming from
We were ready to behave
But there's no freedom without no key
Whatever you think you'll become
All that matters, dear
Is where you're coming from
Once upon a time, a long time ago, a king and queen had a beautiful daughter named Fiona.
But she was possessed by a terrible curse.
By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.
Only true love's kiss could lift her curse.
So Fiona waited in a tower, guarded by a dragon, until the day when her true love would arrive.
But as the days turned into years, the King and Queen were forced to resort to more desperate measures.
Whoa, there.
I don't know about this, Lillian.
Fairy Godmother said only true love's kiss could break Fiona's curse.
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.
Besides, he does come highly recommended by King Midas.
But to put our daughter's life in the hands of this... person?
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...
Rumpelstiltskin!
Mrs. Highness.
How do you do?
Down, Fifi. Get down!
As you can see, everything's in order.
So you'll put an end to our daughter's curse?
And, in return, you sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to me.
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?
Fiona has been locked away in that tower far too long.
It's not like she's getting any younger.
But to sign over our entire kingdom?
Well, if your kingdom's worth more to you than your daughter...
Nothing is worth more to us than our daughter.
Jump, Fifi, jump!
Just sign it and all your problems will disappear.
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!
Who saved her?
No one would have guessed that an ogre named Shrek, whose roar was feared throughout the land, would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.
True love's kiss led to marriage and ogre babies!
The kingdom of Far Far Away was finally at peace.
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!
Sir? You're gonna have to pay for that.
Maybe we could make a deal for it, little boy?
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?
Nobody needs your deals anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!
I wish that ogre was never born!
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.
Better out than in.
That's my line.
Did my little Fergus make a...
...big, grownup ogre stink?!
Oh, that's diabolical!
And on your left, the lovable lug that showed us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop...
...and finally, into the castle.
Play date!
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
Happily...
- Ever...
- After.
Look! A shooting star!
So, what did you wish for?
That every day could be like this one.
Come here, you.
Morning, Daddy.
Morning.
Better out than in.
Did my little Fergus make a...
Cute. Real cute.
This lovable lug taught us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
Play date!
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After?
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...
- Play date!
- No!
Outhouse again!
Come on.
Undies!
Outhouse!
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After.
Roar.
Nice landing, baby.
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.
Happy birthday, niños!
Vamos a la fiesta!
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!
Mr. Shrek, would you sign our pitchforks?
And our torches?
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!
A real ogre?
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.
Why does being your best friend entail me doing everything I don't want to do?
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?
Could you do that ogre roar of yours for my son?
He's a big, big fan.
Do the roar.
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.
- Do the roar.
- Honey?
Why don't you go check on the cake?
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.
Hold still.
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!
Your cake. Voilà!
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!
I'm in a great mood, actually.
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!
As long as you're not doing anything, how about one of those famous Shrek roars?
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.
An ogre only roars when he's angry.
You don't want to see me angry, do you?
Do it.
Hold it together. Just hold it together.
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.
Oh, good.
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.
- You licked it!
- No.
Just because you're an ogre, doesn't mean you have to eat like one.
Looks like you forgot the candles!
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.
Watch the cake?
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.
- Ya.
- What?
No, don't cry.
Hey! I believe you promised my son a roar.
- Do the roar.
- Roar.
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.
No, I ate them.
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.
We need the cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake!
I love you, Daddy.
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.
Is this really how you want to remember the kids' first birthday?
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?
Let's talk about this after the party, at home.
You mean that roadside attraction we live in?
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!
OK, OK, maybe you're not the ogre you used to be.
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.
You spent half your life in a palace.
And the other half locked away in a tower.
Look, all I want is for things to go back to the way they used to be!
Back when villagers were afraid of me, and I could take a mud bath in peace.
When I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to do it!
Back when the world made sense!
You mean back before you rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?
Exactly!
Shrek, you have three beautiful children, a wife who loves you, friends who adore you.
You have everything.
Why is it the only person who can't see that is you?
That's just great.
If she thinks I'm gonna slink back there and apologize, she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize for acting like one.
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!
Please, help!
Please, help!
I'm stuck! Help!
Oh, please, help!
Someone, anyone! Help me!
The pain! I can see a bright light. A tunnel!
Grandma? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me, Granny.
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre, please don't eat me!
I'm not gonna eat you.
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.
Look, move out or get crushed.
So you're not gonna eat me?
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?
Nowhere.
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.
But, seriously, letme give you a ride. I insist.
Come on. It's the least I can do after all you've done for me.
I got a hot rat cooking.
AII right! Can I interest you in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?
A liquid libation to ease that frustration?
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about."
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.
To live the life of an ogre... no worries, no responsibilities.
You are free to pillage and terrorize as you please.
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?
Sometimes I wish I had just one day to feel like a real ogre again.
Why didn't you say so?
Magical transactions are my specialty!
Great. Next to mimes, magicians are my favourite people.
Hold on.
"King for a Month."
"Knight for a Week."
Ogre for a day.
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.
You'll be, like, "Roar!"
And the villagers will be, like, "Get away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"
It would be just like the good old days, when your swamp was your castle.
- When the world made sense.
- AII right, what's the catch?
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.
AII right, I knew it.
So what do you want?
- A day.
- A day.
Rat's done!
To make the magic work, you gotta give something to get something.
In this case, you gotta give a day to get a day. That's all.
I can't just pick up and leave my family.
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.
No one will even know you're gone.
And by the time this day is up, you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.
Still, I don't know.
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.
Do you like white meat or dark meat?
So what day would I have to give up?
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?
A day some meddling oaf stuck his nose where it didn't belong destroying your business and ruining your life?!
Just for an example.
How about the day I met Donkey?
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.
I don't know who that is.
I know. What about a day you wouldn't even remember?
Like a day when you were a baby.
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.
I guess there's nothing wrong with wanting a little time for myself.
Just 24 tiny little hours.
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!
I never needed to ask for anyone's permission before.
So why start now?
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it!
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!
You signed it.
So, tell me. What happens now?
Have a nice day.
I think I fell on my keys.
There are 40 children in that shoe, which is why the weasel goes pop to this very day.
Oh, great.
As we head over the river and through the woods...
Ogre!
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!
This is the part where you run away!
Sure is great to be wanted again.
Nice one.
Fiona?
Oh, no.
My home.
Fiona!
Fiona! Are you in there?!
AII right, Rumpel!
This wasn't part of the deal!
Rumpel!
Ogre!
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!
Who are you?!
What are you doing in my swamp?
Looks like a troublemaker!
Spread 'em!
Nice job, ladies!
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!
You have the right to shut your mouth!
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?
Donkey!
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.
I'm driving, so I'm in charge of the music.
Will you witches make up your mind?
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me in trouble and I need this job.
I am not going back to work for OId MacDonald.
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?
Look, I think you have me confused with some other talking donkey.
I've never seen you before in my life.
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!
And how do you know my name anyway?
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?
A donkey and an ogre friends?
That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!
Can you at least tell me where they're taking me?
To the same place they take every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!
Oh, no.
It's time to crumble!
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!
Yeah!
Gingy?
Gingy snap!
There's one!
Disgusting, filthy ogre!
Hideous monster!
Filthy, filthy creature!
Disgusting creature!
Move it!
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard on mine, Captain Crazy!
Mr. Stiltskin?
You got another customer.
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.
Bring me my business wig.
Mr. Stiltskin, please!
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!
Go away! Terms are in the details, balsa boy.
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!
Stiltskin!
Shrek!
There he is!
So close!
Have I been waiting for you!
Ladies, this is the guy that made all of this possible!
So, tell me, how are you enjoying your day?
AII right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.
Thanks to you, the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to me.
They would never do that.
They would if I promised them all their problems would disappear.
And then they disappeared!
They would have done anything if they thought it would end their daughter's curse.
I ended Fiona's curse!
How could you when you never existed?
You better start making sense, you dirty little man!
Here, letme spell it out for you!
You gave me a day from your past, a day you couldn't even remember.
A day when you were an innocent, mindless little baby.
You took the day I was born.
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin, because when this day is up...
But you haven't heard the best part.
Since you were never born, once this day comes to an end, so will you.
Where's Fiona?
Where's my family?
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?
You see, you were never born.
You never met Fiona.
Your kids don't exist.
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?
Looks like you got exactly what you wanted!
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!
Get him, witches!
You know what'd help morale around here? Flip-flop Fridays.
Feet be comfortable with the breeze on your toes.
Come on, girls!
Lock all the doors, you worthless witches! Do it!
I'll be right back, Donkey!
I don't know you! I don't know him!
I'm glad I'm not you.
Help me! Help!
Help!
No, not my pretty ball!
Watch out!
Wolfie?
My angry wig.
Help! I've been kidnapped by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!
Donkey! Get off of me!
Watch it with your pointy hooves!
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!
I'm being ass-napped!
Animal cruelty! Help!
You need to calm down!
I'm your friend.
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?
Good. I'm gonna letgo...
...right... now.
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!
Donkey! You've got to trust me.
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...
Because...
OK.
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?
I've never seen an ogre cry.
I'm not crying.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.
Just thinking about my grandma, or thinking about baby kittens, or my grandma kissing a baby kitten, or a little baby grandma kitten.
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.
It's none of my business why you're upset.
By the way, why are you upset?
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.
You signed up for one of them time-shares, huh?
No. I signed this.
You should never sign a contract with Rumpelstiltskin!
Yeah, I got that.
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.
Used to be, you had to guess his name, but now everybody knows who Rumpelstiltskin is.
Donkey, I've read the fine print.
There's nothing about an exit clause in here.
Well, you didn't expect him to make it easy for you.
Here, letme show you how it's done.
I didn't spend all that time around them witches without picking up a few tricks.
Your tiny, little ogre brain couldn't begin to comprehend the complexity of my polygonic foldability skills.
What are you doing?
Hey, I can't get my origami on unless you back off.
Thank you. OK, here's what you gotta do. You fold this piece here, make this letter match up here, bring this corner here, and if you do it just right, it will show you what to do. There!
"Try Lou's Bliss."
Who's Lou?
Give me that!
"True Love's Kiss."
You have to take me to dinner first.
"According to fairy tale law, if not fully satisfied, true love's kiss will render this contract null and void."
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?
Well, that's just it, you see.
I don't know.
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.
So... where did you leave her last?
The last time I saw her,
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!
They keep dragons in there!
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!
I'm gonna just hang back here and find us some breakfast!
Fiona!
Oh, no.
If I didn't save Fiona...
...then who did?
This is the favour Fiona was supposed to give me on the day we met.
It's a symbol of our love.
Now smell it!
Hey, man, get that dirty favour out of my face!
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife, so stop complaining and start smelling.
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog, not Donkey!
And another thing...
Wait a minute.
I think I got something.
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.
Luscious and tasty.
Hey! That's my wife you're talking about.
Donkey!
Yeah! Waffles!
And I thought the Waffle Fairy was just a bedtime story.
Sticky stacks of golden, syrupy deliciousness!
Donkey! Don't eat that!
There's a stack of freshly made waffles in the middle of the forest.
Don't you find that a wee bit suspicious?
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.
You did.
Look out!
Donkey!
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
Donkey.
Help! Help me!
Help, Shrek! Help!
Watch your head.
Hey, it's a new guy!
Look at him, all dressed up in his Sunday vest.
He's really tiny, isn't he?
Yeah. Fate has delivered us a comrade-in-arms and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!
- Hey!
- Here you go.
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?
We fight for freedom and ogres everywhere!
I didn't know we could do that.
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.
Trust me, you don't want to eat this one.
I go down smooth, but come out fighting!
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.
Your dinner is my friend!
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!
- She's back.
- There she is.
Fiona!
I'm so happy I found you!
Maybe you missed orientation, but for future reference, personal space is very important to me.
You don't know who I am, do you?
No.
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.
Gather the others and meet me in the war room.
Gretched, make sure everyone is prepared to move out tonight.
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?
OK, I know you don't remember me, but...
...we're married. Hear me out.
And at the birthday party with some pigs and a puppet, the villagers wanted me to sign their pitchforks, and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar."
Then I punched the cakes that the pigs ate and the next thing I knew, my donkey fell in your waffle hole.
Right? Who's with me?
I guess I must have kicked him harder than I thought.
Fiona, I need to...
Witches! AII right, everyone, you know the drill!
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.
Well, I see who wears the chain mail in your family!
Some people like to look at the goblet as... as half empty.
Me, I like to look at it as half full.
We've gone from the bottom to the top, ladies.
But we're not just an empire.
We're a family.
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?
Good.
Yeah, you know, we have put away a lot of ogres.
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.
It doesn't matter to me.
It's not like it's the end of the world.
Except... funny thing.
Now that I think about it, the ogre who got away is Shrek!
And if he shares a kiss with Fiona by sunrise, it is the end of the world! Our world!
My empire!
But, as I was saying,
I like to look at the goblet as half full.
Yelling makes me so parched.
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...
...of agua purificada?
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?
Well, then does anyone care to tell me what it's going to take to get this ogre? You.
Faster brooms?
- No!
- Pointier hats?
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire a professional bounty hunter?
What a world! What a world!
You know, actually not a bad idea. Baba!
I need a bounty hunter.
And if music doth soothe the savage beast...
...then I think I might know just the person!
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.
Stiltskin is leading tonight's ogre hunt himself.
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?
I bet that's because of us.
If that cupcake-eating clown finally leaves the safety of his filthy witch nest...
...he'll be vulnerable.
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route, they'll reach the river by midnight.
We'll be concealed along this road, waiting for his caravan.
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.
And then we attack!
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?
That's my chimichanga stand.
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be really hungry after this ambush, OK?
Go and finish your little speech.
AII right, as I was saying, when the smoke clears,
Rumpelstiltskin is gone and the chimichangas have been eaten.
Far Far Away will finally be free.
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.
How am I ever gonna get her to kiss me before sunrise?
Actually, I was talking about the revolution.
Revolution?
Why don't you just tell her what you told me?
About how you're her true love and you came from an alternate universe.
Well, while I'm at it, why don't I tell her that you're married to a fire-breathing dragon and you have little, mutant donkey-dragon babies.
I do?!
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.
I'm a daddy?
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...
...then I can do it again.
Shrek, do my babies have hooves or talons?
Donkey...!
Hello?
Fiona?
You should not be here, señor.
Puss?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Feed me, if you dare.
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...
-...fancy.
- Do I know you?
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?
Your wee little boots?
Boots? For a cat? Ha!
But you're Puss in Boots.
Maybe once.
But that is a name I have outgrown.
That's not the only thing you've outgrown.
Hey! I may have letmyself go a little since retirement, but hanging up my sword was the best decision of my life.
I have all the cream I can drink and all the mice I can chase.
I'll get him later.
Puss, what have I done to you?
You've gone soft.
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.
Look, it's not too late to fix it.
AII you have to do is help me get a kiss from Fiona.
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?
Well, I know how stressful mounting a rebellion can be...
...rallying the troops, planning attacks, so I brought you a little something to ease the tension.
A gift basket?
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.
Heart-shaped box of slugs.
Skunk-scented candle.
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage."
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.
Look, I don't know what this is all about, but I'm trying to run a revolution.
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,
I suggest you take your gift basket, get out of my tent and go make yourself useful!
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?
An apologetic hug?
And a quick kiss goodbye.
Hey!
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do they make people feel uncomfortable?
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?
Have the years of prim and pampery made me soft?
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?
I am.
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.
Honk.
AII right, Piggies, be gone!
Don't forget to take her little potty box with you.
This little piggy wants to go home!
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.
Pied Piper. How was your commute?
Good.
You call this guy a bounty hunter?
What's he gonna do, flute those ogres a lullaby?
OK, got it!
Make it stop!
AII right, that's enough.
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.
Griselda, seriously, it's time to pay the piper.
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!
Things are getting real sloppy around here!
Here, now make sure they eat up!
You can't end tyranny on an empty stomach! Go on! Go!
Din-din!
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?
AII right, but this is the last time.
Here it comes. Look at him.
I see you!
That's quite a friend you've got there.
I can see why you haven't eaten him.
Donkey! I hate to pull you away from your adoring public, but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.
Just another gift from some clueless lover boy.
That's a good one, Cookie!
Anyone who knows Fiona knows this stuff ain't gonna work on her.
Works on me.
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.
- To the cause!
- To the cause!
AII right!
Hello!
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes and do some scrunches before an operational... op.
This one taken?
We use that to clean the toilets.
And we use that one to clean the thing we clean the toilets with.
I knew that.
There you go, chief.
Hey... Scott?
My name is Shrek, actually.
You're going to get yourself killed at the ambush tonight.
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...
Well, let's see about that.
Hey! Hey... Hey!
What the...?
Fiona?
I got it.
Give me your hand.
The dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop and finally...
Into the castle.
Wow.
OK. Good.
It seems like you can handle yourself.
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!
AII right, let's get those axes sharpened and weapons packed!
Preparation is half the battle!
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!
Ogre, ogre, un momento!
Just give me a minute.
Look, Puss, I'm a little pressed for time.
I am not believing what I have just witnessed.
Back there, you and Fiona.
There was a spark... a spark inside her heart
I thought was long extinguished.
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!
I am her true love. I ended her curse.
You know of her curse?
By day, one way, by night another.
This shall be the norm.
Until you find true love's first kiss...
...and then take love's true form.
You even know the little rhyme!
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!
- How?
- Convince her!
Go to her when she is alone and tell her something that only her true love would know.
Know about what?!
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?
Excuse me. Coming through!
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.
Look, Donkey, the chimichanga cart! Quick!
Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!
And you are ri-donkey-lous!
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.
Secure your positions!
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!
Get back in position!
You need to know, once and for all, who I really am.
You are going to ruin everything!
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.
How do you know about my curse?!
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.
I can explain everything.
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.
Listen, I don't know who you are or how you know about my curse, but if any of these ogres find out I'm...
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.
I know everything about you.
I know you sing so beautifully that birds explode.
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?
I know that when you see a shooting star, you cross your fingers on both hands, squinch up your nose and you make a wish.
I know that you don't like the covers wrapped around your feet, and I know that you sleep by candlelight because every time you close your eyes...
...you're afraid you're gonna wake up back in that tower.
But, most importantly, Fiona...
...I know that the reason you turn human every day...
...is because you've never been kissed...
...well...
...by me.
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!
No, I can't stop myself!
Please! Make it stop!
I can't control myself!
Yeah! Cookie's bringing the heat out of the kitchen!
Oh, no! It's the Piper!
I can't believe I letthis happen, and it's all because of you!
- If you'd just letme kiss you!
- What? You're insane!
We must do something before they fandango themselves into oblivion!
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!
Then it's up to me!
Hurry! We must get them away from the music!
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?
Say what?!
No. Hell...
I don't care how big your eyes get, player, it's not going down.
AII right!
Stop!
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.
Puss, say something.
- Puss?
- Let me explain.
That's how you knew so much about me.
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?
It's the only way to save your friends.
Get out of my way.
You used to believe that a single kiss could solve everything!
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.
True love's kiss was supposed to fix everything!
Yeah, you know, that's what they told me, too.
True love didn't get me out of that tower.
I did. I saved myself.
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!
How would you know?
Did you grow up locked away in a dragon's keep?
Did you live all alone in a miserable tower?
Did you cry yourself to sleep every night, waiting for a true love that never came?!
But... But I'm your true love.
Then where were you when I needed you?
Maybe you kissed her wrong?
No.
The kiss didn't work...
...because Fiona doesn't love me.
Don't despair, fellow ogres!
They can put us in cages, but they can't cage our honour!
Shrek and Fiona are together?!
Yeah, I've heard enough of your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!
Wolfie! My speech wig.
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.
Please stay tuned for a message from our tyrannical dictator!
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...
...shepherd of your dreams.
Recently, a certain somebody has jeopardized our joyous lives.
And that somebody is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!
That is why I come to you, dear citizens.
For whomever brings me this ogre, shall receive the deal of a lifetime.
Just think of it! Total and
- complete happiness.
- Ya!
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
AII your greatest wishes.
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.
So light your torches, sharpen your pitchforks and get your mob on!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Go back where you came from!
It seems that we are safe.
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky and torchy out there. Let's go.
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.
Look, Shrek, I know things might seem a little bleak right now, but things always work themselves out in the end, you'll see.
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?
There is no tomorrow.
There's no day after that, and there's no day after that day after that!
My life was perfect and I'm never going to get it back!
If your life was so perfect, why'd you sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?
Because I didn't know what I had until it was gone! AII right?
I didn't know what I had.
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!
Gingy?
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?
Collecting my bounty!
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?
Rumpelstiltskin promised the deal of a lifetime
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?
Where all your wishes come true.
Wait a minute.
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...
Were you going to eat that?
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
AIso not Shrek.
That's not even an ogre, it is a troll! Nice try.
- And that...
- Roar.
...is just sad.
And what is that supposed to be?
I'm just a frightened old man.
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!
That is your father painted green.
No, it's Shrek! Honest!
Take them away!
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!
Stiltskin!
I hear you're looking for me.
AII right! Finally!
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?
- I do.
- What? But...
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.
That means you have to give me anything I want.
No! Only true love's kiss can break your contract!
So if you thought you were just gonna...
-...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.
Then what do you want?
The ogres. They are all free.
But where is Shrek?
This is not good.
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.
The noble Shrek turns himself in to save a bunch of filthy ogres.
AII that matters is that they're free...
...and Fiona is safe.
I bet Fiona would be really touched to hear that.
But, hey...
...I guess you can tell her yourself.
Fiona!
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!
Oh, yeah.
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.
Nobody's smart but me!
That was a really brave thing you did, Shrek.
Thank you.
No, you were right.
I wasn't there for you.
And not just at the Dragon's Keep, but...
...every day since.
Well...
...you're here now.
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!
Don't be a fool, mule!
She's right. Rumpel's palace is locked up tighter
- than OId Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded by a whole bunch of mean, ugly, nasty witches.
Hey! We can hear you!
Sorry!
We must get into the palace.
Man, Shrek and me just busted out of that place!
But how?
The same way we're gonna bust in.
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?
I guess it'll have to do.
Witches, finally, the moment we've all been waiting for.
The main event of the evening!
I present Shrek and Fiona!
And now, to put the past behind us once and for all,
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!
Fiona's old flame, the keeper of the keep...
...Dragon!
- Donkey?
- And Puss!
In Boots!
Get them, get them, witches!
Incoming!
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?
Your wife!
Uh-oh.
I'll call you! We're in love!
Fiona, hold on!
Hey, you!
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!
Jump!
Now!
The dragon goes under the bridge!
Through the loop!
And finally...
Into the castle!
Run!
Foo!
So long!
Come on, Fifi, go!
Go! Witches, close up the floor!
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!
Come on, go! FIy away! Up, up! Go!
Fifi, no!
Victory is ours!
Looks like we're having curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Hey, we make a pretty good team.
You have no idea.
Shrek?
His day is up. His day is...!
Shrek?
It's all right.
There has to be something I can do.
You've already done everything for me, Fiona.
You gave me a home and a family.
You have kids?
We have kids.
Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named...
-...Felicia.
- Felicia.
I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.
And someday...
...you will.
You know what the best part of today was?
I got the chance to fall in love with you all over again.
Fiona, the sunrise!
You're still... an ogre!
- True love's form.
- Impossible!
The kiss worked.
What?!
Fifi!
Puss!
No, no, no!
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!
I love you, Daddy!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
Fiona. I've never been better.
Roar!
Happy Birthday, Farkle.
Fergus, my little man!
And Felicia, sweetheart.
I believe this is yours.
Thank you, Daddy.
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about giving my babies an encore!
Please, señor, letus have it!
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!
You know, I always thought that I rescued you from the Dragon's Keep.
You did.
No. It was you that rescued me.
Yummy!

Dan4Jem, ADMMX
What would you do to save someone you love?
For Edward, I would stop at nothing.
What is he doing?
Edward!
Edward? Where?
Oh, my God! There he is!
Edward, we love you, you're the best!
No, Jacob's the best!
He's exposing himself!
No! No.
Edward!
Let me start from the beginning.
I used to live with my mom in Nevada.
But now she's always on the road, because she started doing some pro golfer.
So, I came here to the foggy town of Sporks, Washington.
Population: 3,120.
Holy shit!
Make that 3,119.
Anyway, I came here to live with my dad, Frank.
He's the town sheriff.
I haven't seen you in a while.
Your hair's longer.
I grew it out.
I guess it's hard for me to accept my little girl's growing up.
I mean, look at the size of those tits.
- Dad!
- What?
I feel so lonely
Nobody gets me
I am so unhappy
Why can't I find
a cool alternative boyfriend?
There is something strange about this town.
I couldn't put my finger on it.
I used to live here when I was younger.
But I haven't been back in a long time.
I kept your room just as you left it.
Great.
Remember your hamster, Herman?
Might have missed a couple of feedings.
You could play with your dollies.
I don't think so.
What's that?
It's been lonely since your mom left.
Oh, hey.
You wanna come downstairs?
Some people are excited to see you.
Who wants their pacie?
Good girl.
Dad, I'm a teenager.
Right.
I guess I'd better get you some new stuff then.
Frank didn't get me.
I wasn't his little girl anymore.
Becca, you remember Bobby White.
Yeah.
You're looking good.
Good? I'm in a wheelchair.
I can't feel anything below my waist.
You know what's below my waist?
My penis!
Sorry.
We're all glad you're here, especially your dad.
He wouldn't shut up about you.
Careful there, Bob,
I'm gonna roll you down the hill.
Oh, boy, I'm real scared. Bring it on.
Boy, here we go!
You're in trouble there, mister!
- Hi. I'm Jacob.
- Hi.
We used to make mud pies together.
Play doctor?
Oh, right, right.
I remember now.
I gave you a prostate exam.
So, are we going to be at the same school?
I go to school on the reservation.
It must be fun to drink and gamble all day.
Too bad we're not gonna be at school together.
It'd be nice to know at least one person.
Got you a welcome home present.
What do you think?
I think that you're trying to buy my affection with that piece-of-shit truck to make up for the years that you neglected me as a father.
Told you she'd like it.
That's great.
- I fixed up the engine myself.
- Thanks, Jacob.
Go ahead, hop in.
Okay. So you gotta pump the gas to start her up.
Damn fleas.
Jacob, your foot.
Ever since puberty,
I've been feeling a little different.
Cat!
Come here, cat!
Come here!
Transferring to a school that's already in session.
Being the new kid is never easy.
Nice clothes.
Still shopping in the boys' section?
Give her a break. That's what
I used to wear when I was a virgin.
Where'd you get that haircut,
"Fantastic Lesbians"?
Hey, new kid!
- Hi, I'm Derric.
- I'm Becca.
I'm the eyes and ears of this place.
I can hook you up with anything you need.
Cheat sheets, human growth hormone, harvested organs.
No, thanks.
Oh, I get it. You're one of those antisocial, long-suffering loner types.
Actually, I'm more of the humorless type.
Kind of a sourpuss, really.
Full of insecurities, with no great personality, yet every hot guy finds me irresistible.
You must be Becca. I'm Rick.
Damn, girl, you seem really boring and frigid.
You want to go to the prom with me?
See?
I'm Jennifer, future prom queen.
I'm gonna pretend to be your BFF, but if you touch Rick's wang,
I'll cut you.
Who are they?
Those are the Sullens.
They're, like, all adopted by Dr. Carlton, so they're not biologically-related, but they're really, really close.
They moved here a few years ago, and they're, like, super-weird.
It's a total mystery.
Their skin is ice-cold, they feed on human flesh, and they all sleep in coffins.
Maybe they're Canadian.
And who's that?
- Snooki, JWOWW, DJ Pauly D...
- No.
Not the douchebags from the Jersey Shore.
Him.
The really pale dude with big hair and constipated look.
Edward Sullen.
He's a complete hottie.
But, evidently, no one here is worthy.
He wouldn't even accept me as his Facebook friend.
"Favorite activity.
"Searching for a soul which has been cast into eternal damnation"?
But I don't care about Edward.
I've got another guy on the side. Yeah.
Sadly, he went off to fight in Iraq for a year.
But we write to each other all the time.
His name is John.
"Dear John, two weeks together.
That's all it took to fall in love with you.
"And in those two weeks, you did things to me no guy had ever done before.
"I still can't ride a bicycle."
Are you, like, even listening?
You guys are having, like, an instant connection.
How can you tell?
Duh. Hardwicke 101?
You're both staring at each other in slow motion, which although cheesy and obvious, it underscores your respective yearnings.
Right.
Becca.
Why don't you take the empty seat next to that mysterious boy you're destined to have a fatalistic relationship with that will spawn four books and a movie franchise?
Do I smell?
Yeah. Like tuna.
Lunch.
I'm Becca.
I'm Edward.
So you're new to Sporks.
How do you like the weather?
I don't like cold, wet things.
So you must hate Slurpees.
I'm just trying to figure you out.
All right, class.
Turn to page 63 in your books.
This is biology.
Why are we reading The Vampire Diaries?
In the '80s, coke was all the rage.
The '90s, grunge.
Now it's the era of vampires.
It's just super-trendy.
That's amazing.
Hi.
Why aren't you wearing a shirt?
I work part-time at Abercrombie & Fitch.
It's always the same inane questions.
"Who are you?" "Why are you doing this?"
"Are you a natural redhead?"
- Yeah.
- That's hot.
I got a serious case of the munchies.
And I think you know what I need to eat.
Cheetos?
Hell, yeah.
Thanks, dawg. You a'ight with me.
- Antoine?
- What?
The killing.
Right. My fault.
You know who we are, don't you?
Yes.
You're the Black Eyed Peas!
Come on. Not again.
Why does everyone always think we're the Black Eyed Peas?
I mean, her, I get. I get it.
She looks just like Fergie.
And he looks like Will.i. Am, but, Jesus Christ, they don't even have a white guy in their band!
- He hit me!
- That's right!
Mixed martial arts, Tae Bo, and Yogalates created this!
How you like that, pretty boy?
Get him off me! Get him off me!
Now the elbow!
Son of a bitch!
I am not afraid of you!
You should be.
Damn that overwrought unrequited teenage love.
I couldn't stop thinking about Edward Sullen.
No mortal could have had the strength to do that.
Or possess such amazing dexterity.
He can't be human.
Meanwhile, uptown,
Blair was getting cozy with Nate,
who was secretly crushing on Serena.
Excuse me, but you're interrupting my narration.
Oh, shit! Wrong show!
X- O-X-O, Gossip Girl.
- Becca!
- Jacob.
I heard about the accident. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I got you these.
Thanks, Jacob.
You're so sweet and thoughtful.
Any girl would be lucky to have you.
Just not me, of course.
You're like my little gay brother.
I heard you were hanging out with Edward Sullen.
Stay away from him. There's just something really odd about that guy.
Becca!
I'd better go.
Hey, sweetheart. There you are.
There was a killing today.
Fisherman Sculley, by the docks.
The blood was drained from his body and he had multiple bite wounds all over his neck.
You know what that means?
The Kardashians are in town.
Here.
I want you to have this.
- Mace?
- You're my little girl, and there's a killer on the loose.
I'm not gonna leave until I know you can protect yourself.
Now, I'm going to come at you, and I want you to mace me.
- Dad...
- Honey, I've been trained for this, okay?
Here I come.
Good God!
God damn it!
It's so painful! It burns!
- Sorry, Dad.
- No! I'm proud of you.
Are you okay?
Mace will only temporarily stop your attacker.
You have to hit a man where he breathes, Becca.
You got the franks and beans there.
Good for you.
But I'm still coming at you.
Rip off the moustache, sweetheart.
But you love your moustache.
If anything happened to you,
I could not live with myself.
Do it! Do it! Do it!
You're good to go.
Edward?
Am I dreaming?
Right. You're dreaming.
- So you're not really here?
- Exactly.
- Go back to sleep.
- Yeah.
Got to...
Got to TiVo Wizards of Waverly Place.
Patrón! Mario López!
Becca, you're sleepwalking.
Hey, you're sleepwalking.
Just you breathing is the greatest gift you could give me.
I started to wonder, maybe I wasn't dreaming after all.
I had to figure out the riddle.
Who was Edward Sullen?
Was he human, or something different entirely?
Oh, snap!
He dropped his business card!
Good morning, Sporks High students!
Tickets are now on sale for prom.
And after school today, don't forget to visit the quad for the blood drive
generously sponsored by the Sullen family.
Prom! Come to prom!
Prom's almost here! Prom!
Here! Get your flyer for prom.
Check it out.
We finally got a theme.
It's gonna be awesome.
The theme is vampires?
- We just came up with it randomly!
- Cool, huh?
It's gonna be like the festival of St. Salvatore, like the one they have in Italy every year that celebrates the killing of vampires.
And we're renting out a huge stone courtyard.
It's gonna feel just like we're in the 15th century.
It should be super fun. Lots of red capes, blood and binge drinking!
You in?
I don't know. Prom's really not my thing.
Well, it's my thing.
I mean, really, Becca, what is with you?
Prom is, like, the pivotal moment in any girl's life.
I've only been dreaming about being crowned prom queen since I was a sperm in my dad's balls.
We need to talk.
Your skin is pale white.
You dress fashionably.
And you abstain from sex.
I know what you are.
Say it.
Out loud. Say it.
- Jonas brother.
- That's right.
Wait, what?
No, I'm a vampire. Duh.
That was my next guess.
Then ask yourself the most obvious question.
What do we like to eat?
Vampire cereal?
You need to see what I really look like.
This is why we don't show ourselves in the sunlight.
People would know we're different.
You're shining.
No, that's just my bling.
You don't get it. I am a killer!
- Are you texting?
- Yeah, Jennifer.
I am the world's most dangerous predator.
I want to eat you!
My family, we're not like other vampires.
We can control our thirst to only hunt animals and the Real Housewives of Atlanta.
But I don't know if I can control myself around you.
Look, Ed.
I don't like to play games, so
I'm just gonna lay my cards on the table.
I really like you.
I dig the Eurotrash heroin-chic look.
You're totally happening, and I wanna be with you.
I can read everybody's minds but yours.
You have to tell me exactly what you're thinking.
You're pretty, so you don't have to be smart.
Would you like to go to the prom with me?
- Yes.
- That's awesome.
There were three things
I was absolutely positive about.
First, Edward was a vampire.
Second, American Idol is gonna blow without Simon.
And third, the next time I saw Edward,
I was gonna hump the shit out of him and...
Boo.
Oh, gosh, you scared me.
There is something that I wanted to try.
Me, too. I love role-playing.
That's not what I meant.
Don't move.
Kiss me already. I know it'll be okay.
That was amazing.
I've never gone to first base before.
Now let's go all the way.
- Purity ring.
- Yeah.
I won't be able to resist my urges to kill you!
- I don't mind.
- What?
Oh, God!
Becca, no!
Oh, yeah? I like it rough.
Stay away from me.
No, please, please, please, don't come any closer! This is for your own safety.
I'm trying to protect you.
Becca?
Becca?
If this is going to work, we're gonna have to take things slow.
I guess that's okay.
Even though my teen hormones are raging and I want to have sex with you,
I feel conflicted about losing my virginity.
I know you'll never have sex with me, because you're a vampire, so, really, it's the ultimate pubescent girl fantasy.
That was incredibly insightful.
I read it on Stephenie Meyer's
Twitter page.
Becca, I promise, as long as you're with me, you'll never get hurt.
Starting now.
Shit!
Well, I think we all know whatever killed Fisherman Sculley was no animal.
Look at those tracks.
It could only mean one thing.
Canadians.
Damn border-jumpers.
They come here and take all the shitty jobs us lazy Americans don't want, and now they're killing our fishermen, too.
Yeah, Frank,
I think you're missing the big picture.
That is a big picture.
It was my 18th birthday, and the Sullens were throwing me a party.
Well, this is home.
Hey.
There is no reason to be nervous.
Well, I'm different than you.
They might not accept me.
It's like the time when my ex-boyfriend, DeShawn, invited me to his grandmama's house to celebrate Kwanzaa.
I want you to meet my family.
You must be Becca.
I'm Edward's mom, Eden.
We've heard so much about you.
Finger food?
That's Alex and Rosalyn.
I just know we're going to be great, great friends.
And this is Iris.
- I hope we will be.
- No, she already knows it will happen.
Some of us have special powers.
Iris has visions of the future.
- But I'm not on my period.
- You will be. It's coming early this month.
Relax, Becca.
We're just like any other normal American family.
Except, of course, we have no souls, and we walk the earth trying to satisfy an unquenchable thirst for blood.
- I'm Jeremiah.
- He's new to the family.
He's still trying to control his hunger for humans.
Look, I don't want to cause any problems.
Maybe I should go.
But you have to open your presents.
Paper cut.
You're bleeding.
Really bad, actually.
I must have hit an artery.
Becca, your nose!
I knew I shouldn't have partied last night with Lindsay Lohan.
Every time I bring a girl home, you guys try to eat her!
- It's not fair!
- Come on!
Someone here order Chinese food?
Quick, they'll be hungry again in half an hour.
What happened back there can never happen again.
I now know, as long as I'm around you you'll never be safe.
That's why I want you to bite me, and turn me into a vampire.
- No.
- I keep aging and you stay the same.
I'm 18 now. I'm practically a cougar.
I just...
I couldn't live with myself if I turned you into a vampire.
You're always sexy and healthy, and super good-looking, with tons of free time and money to travel the world.
It's a lot like being George Clooney.
Strangely, the only thing that does keep aging is your ass.
It gets pretty wrinkly over time.
You'll never see me again.
Just promise me that you won't do anything reckless.
Okay. I promise I won't date Chris Brown.
Farewell.
Edward?
Edward! Edward!
Edward!
You're just gonna leave me here alone in woods in an area filled with vampires who want to eat me?
Looks like Edward left us a treat.
Great. This is exactly what
I was talking about.
Take that!
I came here to help you, bitch!
Sorry.
There's nowhere else to run.
Your beloved Edward isn't here to save you.
Come on, Jack. Where's the bro code, huh?
You know you don't try to eat someone's girlfriend right after they break up with them.
Kardashians.
Jack, no!
Let's go!
Becca.
I'm going to have to suck the venom out of you.
This is going to be tough for me because the taste of your blood could send me into a frenzy.
- But on the other hand...
- Just do it already!
Okay, Edward,
I think you got all the venom out.
You can stop now.
And just like that, Edward was gone.
I just couldn't get over him.
Why did he have to leave me?
Time passed,
but my yearning for Edward never subsided.
Everyone reminded me of him.
I couldn't get Edward out of my mind.
No matter where I looked.
No matter what I saw.
Without Edward, my life was over.
I felt like dying.
And every night, I had nightmares
that would make me scream really, really loud.
Becca. Becca. Becca. Becca! Becca! Becca!
You're so upset.
Let me check your levels.
That's not good.
You've got more angst than
The Secret Life of the American Teenager.
You know, honey, I'm not real good at the whole parenting thing.
But I do know that breakups are hard.
Especially when you're dumped by someone as handsome and hunky as Edward.
That boy can really fill out a pair of pants.
I'm like, "Look at that! Look at that!"
Yeah.
And let's face it, honey. You're no looker.
And you twitch a lot.
It's kind of irritating.
That's for sure the best piece of ass you'll ever get.
That's my girl.
Your friend Jennifer keeps calling.
You should hang out with her.
Probably cheer you up.
I want you to say good night to your new mommy.
Good night, Becca. I love you. I love you.
She really does.
Well, good night, sweetheart.
I don't get it. Why would anyone want to date a vampire? Lame.
Yeah. So lame.
That movie's totally going to flop.
I can't believe they get married and have a vampire baby.
Thanks for the spoiler alert, dumbshit!
It's too bad Edward dumped you and now you don't have a date for the prom.
'Cause that dress would have looked great on you.
But you don't need a dress, because Edward left you behind in the woods like bear shit.
So I'm going to wear it instead!
And check this out.
Everyone's going to be, like, super jealous.
- Couldn't you just die?
- No.
But you can.
Well, this is me. Where are you parked?
Over there.
Right next to those mean and scary biker dudes?
See you at school tomorrow!
Hey, baby! Come over here!
You can sit on my bike.
Becca. Those guys are dangerous.
Walk away.
Edward?
Shit. Those guys are dangerous.
Told you.
Whether it really happened or I was just tripping out,
I figured the more crazy shit I did,
the better chance I'd have of seeing Edward again.
This is your brake.
And this is your throttle.
Jacob, there's...
There's something different about you.
I don't know what it is.
I've been meaning to tell you.
I'm a man now, Becca.
- Are you telling me that...
- That's right.
- I've had my bar mitzvah.
- Mazel tov!
So will you date me now?
- Say again? I couldn't hear you.
- Right.
- Will you go on a date with... No, no.
- What?
Maybe if you'd stop revving the bike whenever I'm about to ask you something really important, you'd hear me.
- Right. Sorry.
- Thank you.
Becca, I wanted to ask if you would just...
Come on!
Becca, will you go on a date with me?
Sorry, but I don't like to be yelled at, Jacob.
I think I'll just take her for a spin.
Just one thing first.
Becca, you just cut the brake line!
Becca, stop. You're going to hurt yourself.
Hey, Eddy
Well, I know it might seem petty
But I can't stop obsessing over you
Put down that guitar and stop singing like Taylor Swift.
If this is what it takes to be with you,
Edward, so be it.
Becca! Don't drink that milk.
- You know you're lactose intolerant.
- This is for you, Edward.
God.
Sorry. But I did try to warn you.
Becca!
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
You're bleeding. Here.
Your body is so...
...furry.
- Are those teats?
- Yeah, 10 of them, actually.
I'd better go get you some help.
That was fast.
You are so scrumptious.
No!
Be happy it was me that found you and not Rachel.
- Why? What happened to Rachel?
- She was...
...recast.
She wants to torture you for what you did to Jack.
At least I will eat you fast.
- Becca!
- Jacob, run!
That's it? A Chihuahua?
Yeah, I guess so. This whole transformation thing is new to me.
- You can't stop me. You're no werewolf.
- That's why I always travel in a pack.
- Please.
- Get him, girls!
Sign this?
Now, let's get you home.
You'll be all right now. I know it's worked!
Why can't they just be together?
There you are!
I've been looking everywhere for you.
- You look like shit.
- What do you want?
Look, we're all sorry we tried to drink
Becca's blood, even Jeremiah.
But something terrible has happened to her.
Becca who? I am totally over her.
I've moved on.
I am done with normal chicks.
I've finally found someone as freaky as me.
My first wish
Turn the music up as loud as it gets
My second wish
Me and the girls are in the hottest outfits
My third wish
Too freaky?
Edward, I had a vision!
Becca was riding a motorcycle.
She tried to kill herself.
I fear Becca may be dead.
No.
I've got to find out.
How do you feel? It's Edward, isn't it?
Here.
Why did you just take off your shirt?
My contract says I have to every 10 minutes of screen time.
Look, Edward left you.
But I would never do that.
I want to take it out of the friend zone.
I really like you, Becca.
I like you, too.
When I'm with you,
I just feel so safe and secure.
Thanks.
As opposed to how I feel about Edward, which is all passion, lust, complete forbidden fruit stuff.
- I mean, with him, it's all about my vagina.
- Okay!
Do you mind getting that?
Sure.
- Hello.
- Officer Crane?
No, he's not here right now.
Where is he?
It is very important that I speak with him.
He's at the funeral.
- God, no.
- Yeah.
And supposedly, the body was so mangled that the undertaker had to use Krazy Glue to stick the head back on and put marbles where the eyes once were.
Hello? Hello?
It's true.
- Becca's dead.
- Edward, I'm so sorry.
I can't live without her.
Goodbye, Iris. I'm going to kill myself.
I just had another vision about Becca!
Becca's fine.
You don't have to kill yourself anymore.
Edward!
Shit.
Prom rocks!
I love drinking!
What's the matter, Becca?
Still no date for the prom?
Loser!
Here, have a drink, bitch!
She promised me sex tonight!
High point of my life!
Becca! Get in the car, now!
- What's wrong?
- Edward thinks you're dead.
Why would he think that?
Beats me.
He won't live without you and he wants to die.
He's such a romantic.
- Becca!
- Jacob?
Becca, don't go. You belong with me.
I need to know, who's it going to be?
Is it going to be me or him?
- Jacob, I...
- I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
I'm not going to let go until you tell me, once and for all.
All right! Jacob, I'll tell you.
- I choose...
- Cat!
Come back here, pussy!
Edward is going to the Zolturi to have them kill him.
I saw it. I had a vision.
What are you talking about?
Who are the Zolturi?
They are the evil bloodsuckers who only care about themselves and their own narrow vision of the world.
- They're kind of like Fox News.
- Oh, my God.
Edward's going to expose himself in the sunlight, and the Zolturi are going to kill him.
They can't allow humans to know vampires live among them.
It could destroy us.
- Okay, where is this going to happen?
- At the prom.
The Zolturi never miss a good St. Salvatore Day festival.
They flew all the way in from Italy.
Say what you want about them, but they do know how to party.
Suck! Suck! Suck! Suck! Suck! Suck!
I got skills, bitch.
Welcome, Sporks High students, to the 2010 prom.
And don't forget, the main event is coming up shortly.
The crowning of your prom king and queen.
And if you haven't had a chance to vote yet,
don't worry, there's still time.
Just to be sure.
Becca, you're the only one that can stop Edward.
- You have to show him you're still alive.
- I'll do whatever it takes.
So, what would you do to save someone you love?
For Edward, I would stop at nothing.
You already saw this part, so let's get to what happens next.
No!
Edward!
Shit!
Edward!
Edward, it's not sunny anymore.
It's twilight.
Hey, new moon.
Eclipse?
Look at me, everyone!
This is me in all my glory.
Lucky penny.
Edward!
Becca? You're alive?
We have to go now.
Becca, I am so sorry.
I promise you that I will never leave you again.
The Zolturi are standing right behind me, aren't they?
- Yep.
- Don't worry, Becca.
Not talking smack now, are we?
- Stop it!
- "Stop it!"
- You're killing him!
- "You're killing him!"
- And we haven't even had sex yet.
- "And we haven't even had sex..."
Really?
- Becca. Becca.
- Dad.
There you are.
I was worried about my little girl.
You know, there's still a killer on the loose.
But I can see you're dancing with your friends, so everything's all right.
- Dad, no...
- No, Frank, wait.
You have to know the truth.
All of the killing was done by vampires.
Edward's one, also.
And Bobby White's a werewolf.
Sorry.
- I understand.
- Thank God.
The theme of the prom!
- No, Dad.
- Enjoy, okay?
Becca, by the way, thanks for everything.
Too close. Separate, arms length apart.
Too close. Separate, arms length apart.
Too close. Separate! Arms length apart!
Say cheese.
Say cheese.
What...
...the hell?
Where's Becca?
Surrender now, or Salvatore will snap her neck like a Slim Jim.
You must pay for exposing yourself.
Tell you what I'm going to do,
Ed-to-the-ward.
I won't kill you.
But Becca has to become a vampire.
- Cool?
- No, not cool. No way! Never!
All right. Pull Edward's head off, then rip his body apart and set him on fire.
No, no, no. I mean, yes! I meant yes!
Of course, she would love to become a vampire.
She practically brings it up all the time.
Right, hon?
- I guess so.
- Then bite her now!
Bite!
Listen up, people!
May I have your attention?
And now the moment you've all been waiting for.
And this year's Sporks High prom king and prom queen is...
... Jennifer and Rick!
As your principal, I will nominate a new prom king and queen.
And I will pick... I will... Let me see.
I will choose...
I pick you two!
- Us?
- Yes!
Because you two exemplify what's best about this whole prom.
I mean, you really look like a couple of mean,
evil bloodsucking vampires.
Oh, my God! We won! We won!
Yes, yes, yes!
Move. Out of the way.
Edward!
Bite. Bite.
Do it.
Bite me now.
I don't want to wait a second longer.
I will only turn you into a vampire on one condition.
Marry me.
Yes.
Are you ready?
- How do you feel?
- Perfect.
It's how I always imagined.
I love you, Becca...
Team Jacob, bitch!
Fuck me.
'In a land of myth and a time of magic,
'the destiny of a great kingdom
'rests on the shoulders of a young man.
'His name?
'Merlin.'
What you are about to do will bring our enemies to their knees.
You didn't see their faces?
They had no faces.
What are they?
The Dorocha. They are the voices of the dead, my child.
For the tear to be created, it would require a blood sacrifice.
To seal it will require another.
If laying down my life will spare
Camelot, that is what I shall do.
Merlin, no!
We have to get him back to Gaius.
And abandon the quest?
He saved my life,
I won't let him die. If we don't get to the Isle of the Blessed, hundreds more will perish.
Let me take him.
Carrying a wounded man, alone?
It will take you two, or three days to reach Camelot.
Not if I go through the Valley of the Fallen Kings.
You cannot give up on the quest.
Sire, he's right.
This is my fault and I'm sorry.
Take me with you, please.
You'll die, Merlin.
You don't understand. Please, Arthur.
Do you ever do as you're told?
I have to go with you.
Merlin...
We need to leave.
Go!
Can you hear that?
Bees? Food.
You trying to get us killed?
We're riding to our deaths anyway.
It's good to give the horses a rest.
You're quiet.
That's what happens after three days listening to Gwaine.
You did the right thing, you know.
Merlin couldn't continue with us.
I should've saved him.
Ah! Ah! Ooh!
If anyone can get Merlin back to Camelot, Lancelot can.
Lancelot?
Lancelot.
Lancelot.
We bear you no harm.
We wish only to help.
What are you?
We are Vilia.
Spirits of the brooks and streams.
The tear in the veil has upset the balance of the world.
Good spirits as well as bad roam freely.
But this perilous state cannot continue for long.
Prince Arthur is riding to the Isle of the Blessed.
He intends to heal the veil.
He will need help from both of you.
My friend is sick.
I need to get him to Camelot.
Merlin is stronger than you give him credit for.
The young warlock has great power and a future that has been written since the dawn of time.
Do not worry.
Even now, my sisters begin to heal him.
You are tired.
You must rest.
I need to find shelter.
You are safe here.
But the Dorocha...
We will stay with you and protect you through the night.
By dawn, we'll be on the other side of the mountains.
You can't be serious.
These tunnels are crawling with wildeoren.
The tunnels will take days off our journey.
If we make it out alive. We'll cover ourselves in gaja berries.
Oh, sounds great!
It's your choice, Gwaine.
Wildeoren or Dorocha?
I know which I'd rather go for.
Me too.
Never knew you cared!
Quick!
Remind me again why we're wearing this disgusting paste.
Wildoeren are completely blind.
They rely totally on their sense of smell.
Gaja berries will mask our scent.
What are the chances of us not seeing a wildoeren?
None.
Shh!
Keep still.
Don't even breathe.
You fool! It's dead.
That one is, yes.
They hunt in packs.
Run!
We need more stretchers and sheets.
As many as we can find.
Gaius.
The guards were under orders to shut the gates at dusk. Whose orders?
Lord Agravaine's.
Gaius. Have you come to join us?
Why have you closed the city gates?
We have limited resources, Gaius.
As much as I'd like to, we simply can't feed and water the entire kingdom.
Surely the people have a right to be protected.
I would be putting Camelot in danger.
Starvation, disease.
You of all people must understand,
Gaius.
The gates will remain shut until we are free of the evil that plagues us.
Now, gentlemen, where were we?
My lords.
May I be granted permission to address the court?
Guinevere?
Prince Arthur taught me long ago that every citizen of Camelot is important.
He would never stand by and let them suffer.
He would help them if he could and we must do the same.
I feel the pain me as much as you, but we don't have a choice.
If we keep letting people in, our food will run out in days.
You are wrong.
Perhaps you would enlighten me?
Those outside the gates are landowners, farmers.
For days, they have been bartering their wares with the townsfolk in return for the safety of their hearths.
They bring with them far more than they take.
But how long before these wares run out?
Three days ago, Prince Arthur embarked on a quest to rid us of these creatures.
At worst, we have another three before he reaches his goal.
Or do you think he will fail?
Of course not.
Sire, she is right.
Very well.
Re-open the gates.
Merlin? Merlin!?
Shh!
Breakfast?
Merlin, what...?
What are you...? What?
You're meant to be... dying.
Sorry.
Here.
What's that for? Looks like you're going to fall over.
No, not as quick as Arthur.
Oh, yeah?
Come on, we need to catch up with the others.
No, you're going back to Camelot.
You might be. Merlin!
Say hello to Gaius for me.
Merlin!
Arthur can't finish this without us.
Arthur's right about you.
You don't ever do as you're told..
No.
They need to rest, sire.
Even Gwaine's gone quiet.
Sounds like a good reason to keep going.
My lady?
What news of the mighty Camelot?
As we planned.
The city is falling into wrack and ruin. And Arthur?
Last we heard, he had made it past Daelbeth.
Will we never be rid of him?
Patience, my lady.
Even if he makes it, the outcome will be the same.
Then what brings you here so early?
Something's wrong.
A minor irritant.
Guinevere. She takes it upon herself to speak out against me.
She's dangerous.
She's a servant. A spirited one perhaps, but a servant nonetheless.
No, you're wrong.
I have dreamt the future, and in it, that "servant" sits upon my throne.
I would rather drown in my own blood than see that day.
Then we must make sure it never comes.
I couldn't agree more.
We must make sure she never sees another dawn.
Where is Arthur?
I am unsure. Where is he?
The Prince is on a hunting trip, sire. When will he be back?
In a few days.
Is there something you need?
Your devotion to the king is most impressive.
There is something
I would like to discuss.
I wish to apologise.
Yesterday. I feel I let the prince down.
I'm grateful that you spoke out.
I didn't mean to be discourteous, my lord. Well, you weren't.
Not in the least.
Gwen, if you would permit,
I would be grateful to seek your advice.
You understand the people.
I'm not sure, I...
If nothing else, I know that you will be honest with me.
It's not appropriate to talk now.
Perhaps this evening, you could come to my chambers.
Please, Guinevere.
These are dark times.
I need help if I am to guide us through them.
Very well.
Thank you.
Is everything all right? Yes.
He wishes to speak with me later.
I think he means to seek my counsel.
Hello?
We can't stay here.
There's nowhere else, Merlin.
We'll make a fire.
It will keep us safe and dry.
And there's more than enough fuel to get us through the night.
Here.
Bael onbryne!
I'm not entirely useless, you know.
Halt!
But do the people feel safe?
You can speak honestly.
No, they do not.
Go on.
They are frightened.
Night after night, they have seen their friends, their children, their parents all snatched cruelly from them and they don't know who'll be next.
What can I do to reassure them?
Show courage.
Shutting the gates showed you were as terrified as them.
It's like a horse and its rider.
If the people sense your fear, they will not trust you.
I am grateful for your advice.
You have a wise head on your shoulders, Guinevere.
I have kept you long enough.
And I must see to the king.
Do not concern yourself with that.
I will ensure he is well looked after.
It has been a long day.
I'll have my guards walk you safely home.
Thank you.
Hleap on baec!
Seen anything?
Do you know what we're going to face on the Isle of the Blessed?
Do you want to tell me?
The burden is mine and mine to bear alone.
Look around, Arthur.
We would fight 1,000 armies with our bare hands for you.
You are never alone.
We stand together.
Come on, I'll take over.
You need some rest.
Thank you.
Gwen?
Gwen?
You don't have to continue on this journey with me.
Try and stop me.
Why? Because you're a knight, you feel honour-bound?
You wouldn't understand.
It doesn't make any sense to me either.
Gwen?
I made her a vow
I would keep Arthur safe.
You don't have to worry.
I'll keep him safe.
I made a vow, Merlin.
You still think about her?
No.
Arthur's a better man than me.
I'm sorry.
Why? He loves her... and she's happy.
I remember the guards walking me to my door... and then...
Nothing.
It's just a surface wound.
You were very lucky.
Everyone talks about the coldness, but I don't feel cold at all.
You weren't attacked by the Dorocha, Gwen.
Then what?
Gaius?
I fear someone wanted to do you harm.
Why?
I don't know.
If they did, they'd have done a better job.
Maybe. But cold-blooded murder is suspicious.
Better to leave you to the Dorocha.
Lancelot!
O drakon, e male so ftengometta tesd'hup'anankes.
It's all right. It's all right.
Thank you.
Who is your friend?
I am Lancelot.
Of course, Sir Lancelot.
The bravest and most noble of them all.
I'm not sure that is true.
We shall see.
For now there are more pressing things at hand.
The Dorocha cannot be allowed to remain in this world.
The sundered veil must be restored.
We are on our way to the Isle of the Blessed to help Arthur heal it.
Indeed. But at what price?
I know that the Spirit World demands a sacrifice.
It demands nothing, it is the Cailleach, the gatekeeper to the spirit world, who asks such a price.
And there is no other way?
There is not.
Arthur intends to sacrifice himself to heal the veil.
It is my destiny is to protect him, you taught me that.
Merlin, you must not do this.
Then I have no choice.
I must take his place.
From the moment I met you,
I saw something that was invisible.
Now it is there for all to see.
A lot of what you see, old friend... is what you taught me.
It will be an empty world without you, young warlock.
When we get to the Isle of the Blessed, do you really intend to sacrifice yourself?
What do you want me to say?
I look at you and I wonder about myself.
Could I knowingly give up my life for something?
You have to have a reason.
Something you care about.
Something that's more important than anything.
Looks like someone beat us to it.
Bandits?
Do you think we'll make it before nightfall?
There's only one way to find out.
Has something died?
Why am I always the butt?
Can't think.
Pick on Percival.
Why me?
He washes.
And he doesn't set fire to his socks.
No!
Quiet.
Lancelot? How's Merlin?
Bad news...
He's still alive.
Merlin!
Good to see you, Merlin.
Yeah, good to see you too.
It's going to be fine.
Everything will be all right.
I'm just tired.
You don't have to sacrifice yourself.
I have to save my people.
I will take your place.
Merlin...
What is the life of a servant, compared to that of a prince?
A good servant's hard to come by.
I'm not that good. True.
One thing...
Look after Guinevere.
I want her to be happy in her life.
She deserves that.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure.
The Isle of the Blessed.
What is that?
I really hope I'm wrong.
Wyvern!
You're right!
S'enthend' apokhorein nun epello-o-o!
See? That's how you deal with them.
We need to keep moving.
Sire, you must go on.
We'll fend them off.
It is not often we have visitors.
Put an end to this.
I demand you heal the tear between the two worlds.
It was not I who created this horror.
Why should it be I that stops it?
Because innocent people are dying.
Indeed?
Is this the best you can do?
I know what you want.
Do you?
And are you willing to let me have it?
I'm prepared to pay whatever price is necessary.
Forb fleoghe!
So, Emrys, you choose to challenge me after all.
Will you give yourself to the spirits to save your prince?
It is my destiny.
Perhaps.
But your time among men is not yet over, Emrys, even if you want it to be.
No! No!
No!
N-No...
'I want to pay tribute to Sir Lancelot.
'We owe him a great debt.
'But it is not just his deed that we will never forget.
'It is his courage,
'his compassion,
'his unselfish heart.'
He was the most noble knight
I will ever know.
He gave his life for all of us.
He didn't sacrifice himself for Camelot.
I asked him to look after you and he promised me with his life.
He was true to his word.
Arthur was lucky.
And Guinevere? It was only by chance that Gaius found her.
You're wrong. We were not thwarted by luck, it was Emrys. Emrys?
The Cailleach warned me about him.
She said he was my destiny and my doom.
It was he that thwarted us,
I'm sure of it.
So what is to be done?
As long as he exists, I will never gain what is rightfully mine.
You must help me find this 'Emrys' and destroy him.
Gaius?
How can I be of assistance?
You're a man of great knowledge and wisdom.
Knowledge, perhaps.
Have you ever come across a sorcerer called Emrys?
No, it doesn't sound familiar.
Well, if you do hear mention of the name...
I'll be sure to tell you.
It will not go unrewarded.
There is only one person could've heard that name...
Morgana.
We know her powers are growing.
She too must've seen the Cailleach.
But Agravaine...?
I suspect he is not as virtuous as he seems.
And don't forget, he has every reason to despise Uther.
We must beware, Merlin.
Morgana can never know the truth.
She must never know who you really are.
We must make sure this is a celebration that the young prince will never forget.
You can't die. If you were me, would you use magic to save his life?
Yes, I would do whatever it took.
You can't risk exposing yourself like this, it's too dangerous.
You think Uther is going to thank you for healing him with magic?
If it works, I won't have to hide any more. You!

Take them into the forest now.
You stay here.
I'll be back soon.
- Wait!
- No!
I said, stay here!
Father! Wait!
Help us! Please!
Hello! Is anybody there?
Eat!
- Eat!
Eat!
Eat!
This oven's not hot enough!
More wood!
What?
Is it hot enough for you now, bitch?
My sister and I never saw our parents again.
It was just the two of us.
But we learned a couple of things while trapped in that house.
One: Never walk into a house made of candy.
And two: If you're gonna kill a witch,
set her ass on fire.
Fresh milk! Fresh milk for the children!
Keep your children healthy! Fresh milk!
After weeks of living in fear, we have finally caught the one responsible for all this terror!
For crimes against the city and people of Augsburg, and for consorting with the spawn of Satan,
I hereby accuse this woman of the craft of witchery!
Burn her! Burn her!
Behold the eyes of the demon.
Go to hell.
Order!
Order!
Berringer, this is still my town.
Listen to me.
As your mayor, I know only too well that many of you have lost precious loved ones to this witch plague, but we can't just burn this woman.
We first need evidence.
We can't just have...
You know a witch when you see one!
They ride at night and they make pacts with the devil!
This woman will burn!
Burn her! Burn her!
Let the girl go or I'm gonna blow your sheriff's brains all over these fucking hillbillies.
Move. Go on.
Let her go. Go over there.
Check her.
What's your name?
What's your name?
- Mina.
- Don't worry.
When a woman truly deals in witchcraft, she cannot hide it.
A nasty rot sets in. It shows in her teeth, in her skin and her eyes.
This is not a witch. This woman's clean.
I'm sure your sheriff was only trying to protect you good people.
But your mayor has done a very smart thing.
He hired us.
My name is Gretel, and this is my brother, Hansel.
We know that many of your children have gone missing.
But killing an innocent woman will not bring them back.
Go home! We don't want you here!
We don't want more evil in Augsburg!
Well, evil is upon you, whether you like it or not.
Now if your children are still alive, we will find them.
But if anyone harms this woman, you're gonna have me to deal with.
Now go home!
Go!
I guess you're free to go.
Thank you,
Hansel.
You're welcome.
What the hell do you think you're doing? Huh?
That woman is a suspect in my custody.
You can't just come here...
Any man with half a brain could see that she was not a witch.
Now listen, Sheriff.
Hansel and Gretel have been brought here...
You better listen!
I'm not going to have this bitch and her scoundrel of a brother coming into my town, telling me what to do.
Don't!
Just don't.
Come on. Let's get you started.
There's been reports of a strange cottage in the north forest.
Locals won't go near the place.
A good place to start the investigation.
Move!
Gretel!
She looks angry.
Yeah.
A face like that, I'd be angry, too.
- Would you shut up?
That witch we found was a dead end, Mayor.
No trace of any kids. I'm sorry.
But we found this.
That is called the Blood Moon, Mayor.
An eclipse of the moon.
It happens once in a generation and is a night most holy to witches.
Oh, my God.
When?
According to this, three nights from now.
There's no doubt in my mind that all this is connected.
Children being taken in these numbers from the roads and fields so close to town.
A witch does not come out in the open like that.
Not unless she has to.
Witch activity has been increasing lately.
More sightings, animal slaughter, Sabbaths.
It seems the coming of the Blood Moon is dragging every damned witch from their dark hiding place.
So, it seems like a good thing that you brought us here, doesn't it, Mayor?
Half your money now.
The rest when the children are brought back alive.
Oh, there he is, right on time.
This is Jackson.
He knows these woods inside and out.
And he'll take you to where the last sightings were.
Yeah. We can be there in a few hours.
Not at night. It's too dangerous.
We'll leave in the morning.
Yeah, she's right.
It's much too dangerous.
So, any place we can get a drink in this hellhole?
Shut up!
The last one they took was a boy.
Less than two days ago, so the scent is still fresh.
100 shilling for every child you return alive.
You better be fast before our mayor's witch hunters rob this town blind.
You leave tonight.
In witch country at night?
You must be out of your mind.
Not until you finish the job.
Thank you, Wolfgang.
I'm telling you, we should put the fire out.
We're hunting witches, not bears. And we have to eat.
Such beautiful creatures.
Are they yours?
Yes, ma'am.
Why have you come here?
To the dark of the forest?
A child was taken, ma'am.
We're here to find him and take him back.
There are no children here.
Here...
There's only death!
- Witch!
Fools!
This is my land!
How dare you?
Please?
Hmm...
Please, God... No.
There's no use in praying, my friend.
Even your God knows better than to come here.
So we got this witch on the ground, right?
And her eyes, they start rolling back in her head. They're glowing red.
She's trying to put a Soul Searcher spell on me, you see.
So I slap her and rip out her tongue.
And she starts pissing, starts pissing everywhere, right?
But a witch's piss, it's the worst, you see, because it actually burns the ground.
It's like acid.
Although, in small doses, it does cure poison ivy, insect bites.
I'm getting way off the subject, aren't I?
I've got to get back to my friends.
What are you looking at?
There have been abductions here and here, on both sides of the river.
And on this last one, we believe a troll was involved.
- A troll?
- Trolls are extra.
Hey, so what's wrong with the girls in this place, huh?
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't bar wenches supposed to be easy?
- It's really unusual.
- Yes, it is unusual.
Look at this one.
A father and three children attacked.
One child was taken, but she didn't touch the other two.
- Uh-oh.
- That's weird.
That's so weird.
- It is strange. It is strange, okay!
- Yeah, yeah.
Then again, we hunt witches for a living.
What's normal, really?
Excuse me. Hansel and Gretel?
Oh, my God, I can't believe you're here.
I'm Ben. Benjamin Walser.
I am really quite a fan of your work.
That's great.
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.
Listen, if it's not too much trouble,
- would you please sign...
- Oh, no...
Okay.
- Oh, my.
Yeah, that's from when you found the Fox Witch of Antwerp
- and sank her in the moat.
- Oh!
And this one's from the
Secret Witch Ring of Belsen.
When they tried to put a gate to hell under the courthouse.
I mean, you guys, you certainly taught those witches a thing or two.
Wow.
- This is amazing.
- And, uh, weird.
- A little creepy.
- Yeah...
You really keep all this stuff.
All right, well...
I just have so many questions.
Do you mind?
- You know, we have...
- Oh, no, no.
- You go ahead.
- All right, um...
Okay. Um, how do you best kill a witch?
Hansel?
Uh, cutting off their heads tends to work.
Ripping out their hearts.
And skinning them is also nice.
Yeah, but burning is the best way.
'Cause that's the only way to be safe.
- Burning, yeah, of course.
- Burn them all.
Oh, is it true that witches can't harm you?
Well, no, that is horseshit, son.
Their magic doesn't work on us.
And they haven't killed us, yet.
Oh, do you think that's because of the witch that you burned when you were children?
I guess that's how it all started for you guys.
I mean, is that how you became witch hunters?
How did you get your guns?
- How did you get your weapons?
- Okay, okay.
There's lots of things to do.
You're a really nice kid, but we have a town under attack.
She killed them!
She killed them all.
Who killed what?
The witch!
She killed the trackers. All of them.
She gave me a message.
For you all.
The Curse of Hunger for Crawling Things.
I fucking hate that one.
That was awesome.
The witch hunters are near,
I can smell their stench.
Your plan's working.
Did you bring the preparations?
Of course, Muriel.
Oiled frogs, fattened on possum maggots.
And Carpathian nightshade, deadly to the touch, most rare.
And, Muriel, we brought something to test it with.
Open your mouth.
Open!
Swallow, little pig!
He's ready.
It's working.
It's not even warm.
Muriel, this could change everything.
It will change everything.
We will be invincible.
Ow, Ow! Take it out.
Take it out! Take it out!
It's of no use if it doesn't last.
I can make it last.
Forever.
Where are we going?
We're almost there.
Hey.
Hey.
I just had this really weird dream.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
About what?
I think it was about our mother.
We don't talk about that.
Go to sleep.
What do you think? Boy, girl?
Okay. Here you go. I'll take this.
A little small for you, maybe.
Oh, hello.
Uh, no, this, this is...
This is not for me.
Um, so, how goes the witch hunting?
It's good. Witch hunting's good.
It's strange being among these people.
Yeah?
If you hadn't come, they'd have burned me alive.
Yeah, well, I probably would have let them, but I'm old-fashioned that way.
My sister, however, requires a little bit more evidence before someone gets roasted.
- Have you ever come across a witch that you didn't want to kill?
No, never.
The only good witch is a dead witch.
- Can you hold this?
- Mmm-hmm.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
When I was a kid, a witch made me eat so much candy, I got sick.
Something happened to me.
I have to take this injection every few hours or else I die.
You have the sugar sickness.
I actually know a thing or two about it if you ever need any help...
It's all right.
- So...
- I'm fine.
It was good seeing you.
Yeah.
You're very handsome.
And no man in this town will walk with me.
And you have my pumpkin.
I... I have to go.
- See you.
- Mmm-hmm.
It'll all be perfect.
Daddy! Daddy, please help me! I'm lost!
Daddy, please!
Please help me! I'm lost!
Daddy, I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!
I can help you, little boy.
Sweet little boy.
- Please help me!
Daddy! I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!
Please help...
You move, you die.
Get her wand.
Will you stop that?
Ooh.
I like your toys.
They have brought a live witch into my office!
They need to interrogate her.
That's all there is to it. Now...
Good night, Sheriff.
Hey, wake up.
What is she doing?
I have no idea.
I see them.
Is she there?
That Gretel bitch?
Oh, yes, under the moon, over the sheriff, in the town.
There she is.
Good morning, sunshine.
You tell us what we want and this might not end up being the most painful night of your life.
Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
No, no, better, fuck each other.
These witches, they never learn.
Let's try this again.
Where are the children? Why so many?
Where are the children?
The blood of the twelve moons will soon be collected.
And after that, only one object remains.
Why don't you just burn her?
We're wasting our time. She's useless.
Twelve moons. Twelve...
Twelve, twelve...
How many children have been taken so far?
I don't know, ten or eleven.
The files. We need to count them.
- It's eleven.
- Eleven. Twelve moons.
They need one more child.
One more child.
Look, there's gotta be some sort of pattern.
- Look for their age...
- Yeah.
...hair color, genders, something.
- I've got five girls.
- Six boys.
You need another girl?
"Twelve moons," what does that mean?
It's a month. It's a month.
There's no April. April is missing.
It's April.
They need a girl born in April.
You are too late.
- Go!
- Yes!
Sheriff, birth records of Augsburg.
Do you have them here?
It is there. Strictly for the law of this town, not for filthy bounty hunters like yourself.
Come on.
There can't be that many.
Ah!
- Anything?
- I only got one!
Little girl, six years old, born April 8th.
- She's the only one I could find.
- You go.
This girl, do you know her?
Yes, I know her. Mary Behlmer.
Where does she live?
Sheriff, she's in danger!
Fire! Fire!
Time is up. Tell me where she lives.
Over here!
- Mama!
- Shh!
Stop! Stop right there!
Oh, no! No, no. Oh, no.
No, Lucas! Lucas.
No!
Damn you!
Too late, already damned.
Take her back!
To the Well!
Over here!
We need more help!
Now whatever happens,
I want you to stay cool.
- Follow my lead. Okay?
- Got it.
Are you a good shot?
No.
Not really.
That's why I use a shotgun.
Gretel, the famous witch hunter.
Finally we meet.
Who are you?
I see you got my invitation.
Say your name or I'll pin you to the fucking wall.
I go by many names, none of which you're worthy of pronouncing.
Oh, my God.
Help! Help!
Please!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Help!
Feisty bitch.
Shit.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to kill you.
Not now.
And not like this.
You have something I need.
The last ingredient.
Ugh! Humans have such ghastly taste.
I think this place...
...could use a bit of color.
Shit!
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
Yes. No, people. Please be calm.
Yeah, one at a time.
Look what his witch hunters have brought to Augsburg.
Seven people burnt to death in the fire.
And another young, innocent child taken because of those witch hunters.
No.
Because of you.
I say bring them all to justice.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
No! No!
The witch hunters are not the ones to blame for this.
This is madness.
People, hasn't enough blood been shed?
No, no...
Not enough, Mayor.
Not yet.
Ah!
- Good morning.
- What are you doing?
You were covered in filth, so I was just cleaning.
What happened?
Um...
Well, the witches took a young girl, and a lot of people died in the fires.
And now the Sheriff, he's blaming you and your brother for what happened last night.
Augsburg's not really safe for you anymore.
And my brother?
Last time I saw him, he was fighting one of them on her broom, flying out of town.
Right.
Wow.
Where did you get all this stuff?
Um...
From everywhere.
I actually plan to be a witch hunter, too, when I get older.
Like you guys.
This isn't the life we chose, Ben.
I was wondering about that story about your parents leaving you.
Is all that true?
Yep.
Why?
I don't know.
That's what they did.
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you want some porridge?
Ah! Sure.
Not too hot, not too cold, but just right.
So last night, who was she, the witch who attacked us?
I don't know.
She looked normal at first, but then she changed her face.
- I thought only Grand...
- Grand Witches have that ability, yeah.
Who is this?
She lived outside of town a long time ago.
She was accused of witchcraft, but she never confessed.
We just burned her anyway.
You're safe.
You'll be safe.
I have to find my brother.
Hansel!
Hey!
Hansel! Are you all right?
Oh, shit.
The witch hunting is going well, I see.
Yeah.
Hey, say, can you...
Can you tell me which way is back to town?
That way.
That way.
Okay.
Thank you!
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- You need some help?
- No, I'm fine.
I'm fine. Thank you.
Okay. I'll see you later.
Motherfucker!
Are you okay?
Hi. Help me.
Hansel!
Hansel!
Hansel!
Come here.
Oh, she's a wild one, eh?
What do you think you're doing?
You're under arrest for the burning of Augsburg and for bringing the witch plague to our streets.
Listen, you idiot! The witches are planning something big!
I need to find my brother and save your shitty little...
Shut up.
This time,
I do the talking. You do the bleeding.
Are you done yet?
I've got to get to my sister.
This may take a while.
But if we don't clean it, you'll get the fever.
Fever?
You've really taken a beating, haven't you?
I think the real damage was to my dignity, which I left somewhere in that tree back there.
It's probably gonna be easier if you just get in.
Oh, no, no. No, I can't.
The water is healing.
Yeah, I don't swim well.
Then I'll go in with you.
Oh, okay.
Oh, boy.
So, it's healing waters, did you say?
I have a passion.
Horses, just love them.
Beautiful creatures, huh?
When you break any kind of a horse, you have to be hard on them from the beginning.
Show them who's boss.
Or else, they will never learn.
At first, they will hate you.
But once their spirit is broken, they will do anything you want.
Oh!
Bitch!
Hey, boss, maybe we should take her back to town now.
I'm not finished breaking her yet!
You're making this too easy.
I got it.
You know, the last time
I was in waters like this,
I came across a formidable Serpent Witch.
She mostly looked like a toad but she could breathe underwater, which made her difficult to track.
- She was deadly.
- Shh.
You talk too much.
You're pathetic.
She has guts.
Ooh! I like that.
Aah!
That's going to make me enjoy this even more.
No!
Well, boys, you can have her, after I'm done...
No! No!
...If there's anything left.
What the hell?
No!
Following this road, you should be able to make it back to Augsburg by nightfall.
Yeah.
I hope so.
When you find your sister, could you come back to see me again?
Yes, of course.
Drink.
No.
Drink!
Why did you save me?
Trolls serve witches.
Hey, wait.
Wait!
What's your name?
Edward.
Edward, wait!
Where am I?
Hansel?
Gretel?
Where have you been?
- Where have you been?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, what happened to your face?
Gretel?
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay.
Who did this to you?
I'm okay.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
I'm okay.
Where are we?
I don't know.
Oh!
You okay?
Did you have to land on me?
What is this place?
This isn't a regular witch's lair.
No.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hey, sis?
I think you're gonna want to come see this.
I think this is our old house.
And this is our old room.
Here. Look.
There's your bed.
Right?
Ah!
Remember this?
I think that's you.
And some sort of vicious badger.
Old beds.
Hansel.
You ever wonder what happened to our parents?
We don't talk about that, Gretel.
We made a promise, you know that.
Why do you think the witches' spells don't work on us?
Leave it alone.
- This is our house.
- Yeah?
This is where we grew up!
And what does that look like to you?
I don't know, Gretel.
We grew up over a witch's lair.
So what? So we're cursed?
No. I think that our mother was...
I see you finally found your way home after all these years.
Mmm. How very sweet.
I remember this house.
The house of Adrianna, the Great White Witch.
Your whore of a mother.
Let me tell you a little story.
Once upon a time, near a shitty little town, there was a farmer who fell in love with a white witch.
And with their two beautiful children,
oh, they were so happy.
But not for long.
During a Blood Moon, there is a potion
that will make you immune to fire.
The key to the potion
is the heart of a Grand White Witch.
But your mother, the most powerful white witch,
was too strong for us.
So it had to be you, Gretel.
It had to be your heart.
As the Blood Moon approached,
I sent out a little rumor
to the people of Augsburg.
And when she knew they were coming,
she had your father take you into the forest to hide you.
- Father! Wait!
Don't let her get away!
She didn't know what they would do to her,
but she was too proud to run.
And a white witch would never use her magic against humans.
When your father came back for her...
No!
...they hanged him.
- Run him up!
- No!
...right in front
of your mother's burning flesh!
Adrianna was gone.
But so was your heart.
And the Blood Moon passed.
The end.
It's a beautiful story, don't you think?
They died to save you.
And all your life, how you've hated them.
Tomorrow sisters from all dark corners of the land will join me in the light of the Blood Moon for the greatest Sabbath of all.
The only thing left is the everlasting power of the heart of a Grand White Witch.
You know, you talk too much.
Bad move, witch hunter.
Hansel!
Drink it. It will help the pain.
Mina?
What did you do?
Mina?
You're a witch?
There are good witches in the world.
- Not many, but some.
- You stay back.
I'm a witch, but I won't hurt you.
I checked you. You were...
You were clean.
Yeah, but only the dark witches bear the signs.
Dark witches?
What are you talking about?
Think about it, if their spells don't work on you, why would mine?
I'm not like them, Hansel.
Gretel. Shit.
- Where are you going?
- They have my sister.
Who has your sister?
Witches have my sister. They...
- Where?
- They said something about a ritual or a gathering.
I don't know.
There's a place deep in the forest, nearby the mountains.
A place dark witches use for their Sabbath.
Where is it?
Hansel, I...
Mina, how do I get there?
If there is a Sabbath, there will be many witches.
They'll be too powerful.
They'll kill you, Hansel.
I don't have time for this.
No, listen, Hansel,
I found something here, in this cave.
Something very powerful.
Something that could help us.
The Abramelin Grimoire! It exists!
This is the book of protection against black magic.
I can't believe this.
Where did you find it?
Don't ask, kid.
If this thing does what it says, it will allow us to penetrate their protection.
Oh, yeah?
Their wands won't protect them anymore.
We just need something to bless.
Okay, let's start with this.
I hope this works.
All right.
You ever shoot a gun?
Well, I did win the county fair three times.
All right. In that case...
Don't touch the gun.
Edward.
What are you doing here?
What's going on?
Muriel.
Edward,
I need your help.
Please, Edward.
- Hey! You filthy oaf!
Get the children. We're moving out.
It's time.
Okay, are we good?
Yes.
Well, as far as you go, kid.
But, I will leave you with this.
- Wow!
- Find a place to hide.
Shoot anything that moves.
Good luck.
Shut up!
Oh!
After tonight, no sister will be burned on their pyres!
No sister will be ashes on the ground!
I want your brains!
And now, now we feast!
- That's a lot of witches.
Okay.
I'm gonna go down around the other side.
Push them into the middle, get them away from the kids.
Now, when you see my signal, you unleash hell.
Wish me luck.
Wait. Wait. What's the signal?
It'll be me blowing one of these bitches' heads off.
Yes.
The hour has come!
The Blood Moon arrives!
- The Grand White Witch dies!
Excuse me! Excuse me, ladies. Hi.
It seems as if I've lost my invitation to your little dinner party here.
I apologize.
But don't worry.
I didn't come empty-handed.
Sisters!
Allow me to introduce you to the famous witch hunter Hansel.
Personally responsible for the deaths of over 600.
Listen to me carefully!
If you let my sister and the children go now,
I'll consider not killing each and every one of you.
Enough with this.
- Take his fucking head off.
- Yes.
Please work.
We have to hurry. You get the children.
I'll get her heart!
Now, move!
Fucking...
Eat it!
Walk!
Move it!
Come on!
- Gretel!
Ohh!
Edward.
Gretel!
I'm okay! Go get the children!
Stay still!
Get off of me!
No!
Thank you!
- Shit!
- Too late.
Gretel!
Thank you.
- You okay?
Muriel's still alive.
I'm not done.
Ah, Gretel, Mina. Mina, Gretel.
- Hey.
- I need that.
- Okay.
- She flew off that way.
Well, where are you going?
I have to help Edward!
Edward. Who the fuck's Edward?
- Ah! Hell, yeah!
- Ben!
Hansel! Hansel!
I did it! I shot her! Muriel.
- Where?
- Uh, I shot her down, over there.
Good job.
She's close.
Edward?
Oh, you can't be serious.
Is this...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wow.
Whatever you do, don't eat the fucking candy.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Stop right there, or the little boy dies.
I thought it would be fitting for us to end up here, where it all began.
Kind of lost its charm a little, huh?
Drop it.
Good boy.
Don't worry, kid.
I'm not gonna let her hurt you.
Oh, really?
Really.
The end is near, witch hunter.
I wish I could say it would be painless, but that would be a lie.
Get away from him.
Always funny seeing a white witch with a wand.
What are you going to do?
Hit me with your love spell?
Not bad.
Sacrificing yourself to save a human.
Pathetic.
No!
Mina. Hey.
Come here.
Hansel.
Hansel.
I tried to stop her.
You did. You did good.
You did good.
I want you to do something for me.
Anything.
Kill the fucking bitch.
You got to be fucking kidding me.
Oh, please.
Please?
Please, stop.
Please.
Yeah, nice try.
I fucking hate you.
You know, you look like shit.
You know that?
- So do you.
Finish her already.
Revenge doesn't change the past.
It won't bring our parents back.
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.
- Glad to hear it.
- Ow!
But it sure as hell feels good.
My sister and I know the truth.
We know who we are now.
And so do they.
They know our story,
our powers,
what we can do.
And they should fear us.
All of us.
We should be getting close now.
And so after this next one, we've got three more to go.
Three? You said three more three witches ago.
Come on, you always say, more witches, more money, right?
Yeah, but you ain't getting any of it.
Unless you want to pull the cart.
Right, big guy?
I told you he'd come in handy.
There are good witches in the world.
We know that now.
But for the ones practicing the black arts, beware.
We're coming for you.
No matter where you are, we'll find you.
And dead or alive,
we'll take you down.
Edward, want to knock?
- Dead.
I hate to break it to you, but it's not gonna be an open casket.
Watch out!
You... Um... Your light.
What? Oh! I'm such a moron!
How's the flick?
Ah, you know, Adam Sandler gets in a mess.
Wife gets pissed. Rinse and repeat.
Predictable. Formulaic.
- Fart jokes. You wouldn't like it.
- Hmm.
How would you know what I like?
I wouldn't know.
Well, maybe you should find out sometime.
Oh, shit! What the...
Hey, Hal! Hey...
What the hell?
Hal?
What the... What the hell's going on?
Kim?
Hey! Hey! Hey, you.
Everyone's gone. They're all gone.
Got anyone in the theaters?
No, man. I haven't seen a soul.
Jeez! Same down in the food court.
You know what happened?
We're on backup power.
Heading down to maintenance to find out more.
We're being Punk'd, right?
Oh, yeah.
Allen Funt is gonna pop out any minute.
- Who?
- Forget it.
The hell is that?
What did you see?
Wait here.
Who's there?
You see something?
Huh?
Anybody here?
Hello?
Anyone here?
Where is everyone?
Anybody here?
Hey! Hello?
Help me.
Someone help me.
No!
Manny. Manny.
My baby. Manny!
Paige?
I waited for you.
You here?
Paige?
Son of a...
What the hell is going on here?
Twenty-three goddamn flights.
Piece of junk.
Yo, Jesus, what's up with the...
This is yesterday's.
Paige?
Paige?
Paige?
Anyone?
Where are you?
Damn it!
Hello?
Somebody there?
Shit!
Hey!
Open the door!
Open up the fucking door, man!
Hey, man, I need... I need a light.
They're all spent.
Give me one of your lights, man.
Open the door.
Give me one of your lights. Please.
God damn!
Hello, little boy
Don't you remember me?
Hello, little boy
Don't you remember me?
Well, I'm the same one that brought you from Tennessee
I said, "You came to the city
Got me in your heart"
Now don't forget that I'm the one who put you wise
Please don't high jive me, baby
I ain't the jiving kind
No, don't high jive me, daddy
I ain't the jiving kind
'Cause you'll find I'm hip and you'll up and lose your mind
Down in Tennessee, you was ragged and beat
Walking around barefooted drinking sneaky Pete
Don't get me started
I know just what to do
If you make me mad
I'll tell the whole world about you
Don't move.
Put the gun on the floor.
It's a flashlight.
Just put it on the floor.
You mean this gun?
Put or drop?
Put the fucking gun on the ground!
Come on, the light, too.
You want me to turn it off?
The light, too! Now!
All right.
Okay. What now?
Why don't you just lower that barrel a little, we'll talk this shit out, huh?
Can I at least have my drink?
Is that permitted?
Hey! God damn it!
Go on! Shoot me! Do it!
Shoot me!
You're afraid to.
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.
You shoot me, there's nobody left. Right?
Right.
What's your name?
What's your name?
James.
James. Like Jesse James.
Gun and all.
I'm Luke.
I've seen your face.
Oh, yeah?
TV.
That's right.
News 7. I'm the new field reporter.
You're always yelling at people with the microphone.
Look, James. Here's the truth.
I'm just happy to see another face.
You know what I mean?
Why don't you put the gun down and we'll have ourselves a drink.
Come on, I'm buying.
It'll be my pleasure.
Where'd you find this?
It's my mom's.
She keeps it under the bar.
- Your mom owns this place?
- Nah. Bartender.
She around?
Up the street.
Went to check the light in the church.
- Light?
- Yeah.
A guy came by saying he saw a light in that church.
A guy? How long ago?
He's gone now.
You got a nice generator down there.
How much gas you got left?
I don't know.
My mom told me to keep feeding it every few hours, though.
You a strong kid, Jesse James?
Strong enough.
Good. Drink up.
You're gonna need it.
Why?
Here. Batteries work.
You're gonna help us get us both out of here.
I'm not going nowhere.
I've got to wait for my mom.
She just went up the street to the church.
She told me to stay right here.
We need to get out of this city.
You understand?
I'm not going nowhere.
We're moving out when she comes back with some people.
What people? There are no people.
Don't matter. She told me she'd be back.
Have you taken a look outside lately, James?
It's, like, 11:00 in the morning.
And it's fucking pitch black!
I've been out there for the last three days.
And every day the sun comes up later and goes down sooner.
Every day, less daylight.
More people are just gone!
You understand what I'm saying?
I don't think your mom's coming back.
- Yes, she is!
- No, she's not.
Now, I don't know what in Christ is going on here, but I'm not hanging around in this dump to find out.
You wanna just wait till the gas is up in that genny, knock yourself out. I'm out of here.
Fair exchange. Good luck.
I'm serious, all right? I'm going.
- I'm gone.
- Then go, motherfucker, go!
Where is he?
Manny, baby, it's Mama. Manny!
What'd he do with my Manny?
Come on.
Hey, lady.
- Please, you've seen my Manny?
- I don't know. I don't know.
- My baby.
- I don't know, I don't know.
Randy, where you at?
Hey, lady, there's nobody else here, all right?
Randy! Randy!
He took my baby.
I know he took my baby.
Look, I'm real sorry for your...
- Get away from my baby!
- Whoa, whoa! Hey!
- Where's my baby?
- Don't you point that gun at me!
- Where's my baby?
- God damn it!
Help me. Help me.
So, how'd you get this far without a light?
You didn't have one when you came in here.
How old are you?
Twelve-and-a-half.
Manny's nine months today.
That's your boy?
Yeah.
I'm James.
That's Luke.
Rosemary.
You a doctor?
Dr. Williamson, please report to the ER.
Dr. Williamson, please report to the ER.
Gloria?
Manny? Manny!
Please... God...
You a doctor?
Physical therapist.
Manny's dad comes here to drink, so I thought that...
I thought that he took our baby here.
I...
It's okay.
You're okay.
I do have light.
I got a lot of lights.
The batteries kept dying in my flashlight.
These last.
Why does the power work here?
Backup generator.
Won't last, though.
You're the first people I've seen in two days.
- Why?
- Why what?
Why us?
Why are we the ones left behind?
Just stay close to the light.
Just stay in the light, all right?
Help! Help!
Help!
Someone help me!
Sounds like he's hurt.
Bad luck for him.
What? We can't just leave him.
Someone help me, please!
Go get him, then.
- I'll go.
- No. No.
- You stay here. I'll go.
- Give it to me. Move.
Lock the door.
Then open it when you hear me coming.
Fast!
Come on, let's get inside.
- Help me!
- Shh.
Help me! Help me!
All right.
- Come on. You're coming with me.
- No! No!
- It's all right, it's okay.
- No! No!
Come on.
- They're here. They're here.
- No, it's just me.
They're here.
Shit!
Come on! Not now.
They're here.
They're out there. They're here.
Here.
All right, come on. One more time.
Mama.
What are you doing?
I got to find my ma.
I got to go. She's waiting for me!
We have to stay in the light. I'm sorry.
He ain't coming back, is he?
We're almost there.
No!
Come on!
Hey!
Hey! Open the door!
Open the door!
Come on! The lights! Hurry up!
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
What, am I in heaven?
Better.
A bar.
I gotta go. I gotta go.
- No, lie still. Just...
- I gotta go.
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?
My name is Paul. Paul.
- Paul, that's my name.
- Good.
You have a concussion.
So we need to keep talking. Okay?
- Okay.
- Right.
That light.
How'd you get there?
I...
I was working at the Fairlane Center.
And the whole mall went dark.
I mean, all the people were all gone.
So, I was... I was on my way out of there, when my light starts dying.
And then someone came out of the dark and hit me.
I was taken somewhere.
And then my light came back on.
And I was outside.
I don't even know how I got there, but I...
I walked till I found that bus shelter.
Taken?
Taken.
I don't know where.
I don't know where.
But there were these voices.
These whispers.
No bodies. No faces.
Souls.
Only shadows.
And I was drowning in them.
So I started screaming. Started screaming.
But there was no sound.
There was no sound.
It was like I was fighting, fighting for air.
Like I was fighting to exist.
Sounds like some kind of fever dream.
No. Dreams are much more broken apart, more obscure.
- I was taken some place for three days.
- I'm gonna keep you warm.
This was in real time.
So, did you get a look at the guy that hit you?
I told you. I told you it wasn't a person.
You saw it, too, didn't you?
I knew it.
When I was lying there, waiting for the bus,
I had time and I went through the list of all the ways everyone could just disappear.
Flesh eating bacterias.
Nanotech running amok.
A particle collider accident.
Parallel universes.
Neutron bombs. Gamma ray bursts.
Alien abduction.
Singularities. Wormholes. Black holes.
- Stop it!
- But the thing is that the math doesn't add up.
The math does not add up.
My boy is missing.
His mother.
It just doesn't add up.
This is no accident. There's a reason.
You're gonna lay your Catholic guilt on us now?
Why are you here, Luke?
You know?
No idea. And I don't care.
Well, you should.
We all... We all should.
Why didn't we go with everyone else?
- Because...
- Why?
Like, when you shut down a movie projector, it doesn't just stop on a dime. It winds down.
We're the last spin on the reel before it stops for good.
I know I've done things in my life.
Awful things.
I've hurt people.
I've made mistakes.
We all have.
So what are you saying, that this is punishment?
For what?
- That's between you and...
- And God?
Between me and God?
I don't know, I think God's closed up shop, just like everybody else!
Don't say that!
You're trying to tell me
- that he deserves this shit, huh?
- Leave him alone!
You know, I think that you're just pissed off
- 'cause Jesus didn't beam you up!
- Stop it! No!
You know what? We don't need some fucking left behind sermon!
What we need to do is...
Oh, no!
Sweet Jesus. Sweet Jesus.
Lessen the load.
- What?
- The power load on the genny!
- You got to lessen it.
- Turn off anything we don't need.
James, get the games.
The jukebox.
Turn them off, turn them off.
Get the neon signs.
Strip the top off.
Looks like somebody rerouted it up to the bar after the main grid died.
Yeah. My ma.
At least we got plenty of gas.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
The electric charge is fading, anyway.
- Like the batteries and the flares...
- And the cars and everything.
It's just impossible.
But the bus shelter? The one you were under?
Solar powered.
It's experimental, one off.
The city was thinking of going green for a while. I did a piece on it.
Okay. So, solar is working.
Yeah. Too bad the sun's not.
James, where does this go?
Sonny says it's where we go when the shit hits the fan.
Sonny had a point.
All right, rocket scientist. How long?
- How long what?
- How long we got?
- How long until it dies?
- Yeah.
Couple hours, I don't know.
Couple minutes, I don't know.
I don't know. There are no known laws of physics operating here, okay?
I don't fucking know. I don't know!
Please, God.
Please, God. Please, God.
Hey, come on, take it easy.
Okay, okay.
Please, God. Please, God.
Please, God. Please, God. Help us.
There's this island.
This island right off the Carolinas, called Roanoke.
And in 1587 it was...
It was the first English colony.
117 men, women and children were living there.
Then, one day a boat comes from London with supplies.
But lo and behold, there's nobody to supply,
'cause everybody's gone.
The whole entire colony completely vanished.
Left everything behind.
Food, livestock, clothing.
They sent search parties looking for everybody for days and the only thing they find...
You know what they find? One word.
One word.
Just scratched... Scratched on a fence post.
Croatoan.
Cro... What?
Croatoan.
What does it mean?
I don't know. Nobody knows.
It's just a big mystery.
Maybe it's a message from the local Indians or...
Or a word or...
Or just a last word.
Nobody knows for sure.
But maybe it's...
Maybe it's a warning.
A warning, like an error warning your computer gives you right before it crashes.
A warning from who?
Does it really matter? Huh?
Someone just hit the restart button and...
And the lost colony was just this little warning right before the...
Right before this big reboot.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Feels like a semi smashed into my skull.
That's 'cause you think too much.
James, wet the towel, sweetie.
There we go.
We need ice.
I'm just gonna raise your head up.
Just breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
Hello?
Anybody here?
Stephen?
Is somebody here?
Control.
...news.
Reporter Luke Ryder continues his series on the storm of controversy surrounding alleged security lapses at the West Haven nuclear power plant.
Yeah, you definitely don't want to miss that.
And speaking of storms, Paige.
Well, that's right,
Carolin and Stephen, we're tracking a very large front moving in our direction.
Kind of an unusual storm...
...the good news is this low pressure system is followed by a very nice high pressure front, so things...
So things...
...defies any logical or rational explanation.
Hey. Hey!
You can't say that it's evil.
You can't say that it's human or not human.
But it is the new law of nature.
And we have to adapt.
Last night after the blackout,
I heard my brother call out to me from the darkness.
My brother died eight years ago in an automobile accident.
It can trick you.
Stay near a light source.
But do not trust any light other than the one that you hold in your own hand.
This is David Breadan, at WDID in Chicago.
If you're receiving this broadcast, then your phone service may still work.
Please, call or text me at this number.
Damn it.
- Hello?
- Luke?
All right.
We need to get out of here.
Now.
He can't go anywhere.
Don't you get it?
Why we're here?
At this exact place?
All of us?
I'll tell you why.
The light.
The light's protecting us.
Protecting us?
Ever see moths fly into a flame?
What are you trying to say?
You trying to say that this is a trap?
A trap!
A dead end.
But whatever's out there is in here now.
Point is when that genny dies, we die.
Maybe that's how it should be.
What?
All of us have seen it.
Those souls.
Out there in the dark.
How do we know they're not the people we've already lost calling us over?
How do we know that that's not heaven and this...
Is...
If my boy's with them, then that's where I'm meant to be.
And if he's not, then I ain't going nowhere till I find him.
Look, there's a truck.
I don't know, maybe five, eight blocks away.
The power's drained, but it's not dead.
Now if we can get it started, we all have a chance of getting out of here.
Maybe get you to a hospital.
Oh, yeah? A hospital. Where, man?
Where?
Chicago.
The morning after it happened,
I caught a satellite feed.
There are survivors out there. Like us.
So where are the rescue parties, huh?
I don't know.
It's been three days,
I don't see any search parties.
I don't know, all right?
All I know is I'm gonna roll that truck to this genny.
I'm gonna string some jumper cables from the genny to the truck's battery,
I'm gonna start that truck and I'm gonna get out of here, with or without any of you.
Yeah, roll? How you gonna roll it?
You can barely walk.
Then a little help would be nice.
James, we have a vehicle.
All right? We can cover more ground.
You know, maybe look for your mom.
Your son.
We can wait till morning.
You sure there's one coming?
The first couple of days, I...
You know, I...
Kept asking myself why am I still here.
Why me?
You know, just... Just... Just...
Talking to myself, running from place to place, shouting my name like an idiot.
Anything to remind me that I exist.
I'm here because I will myself to exist.
You know what? Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe this is just a passing storm.
Maybe it ends tomorrow.
You said it yourself, Paul.
A big reboot.
Which means that this could all be a new beginning, right? Not an end.
But we can't wait around here to find out.
Those rations downstairs.
Put as many as you can into these garbage bags, all right?
We need to bring them with us.
And keep an eye on that generator.
It goes black, you take this and get out of here.
But what about Paul?
I'm supposed to watch him.
Hey, you heard what I said.
Here.
Take this, all right?
It's good luck.
I'll bring us back a real one.
God, you're beautiful.
Let me tell you something.
You were born for the movies.
I think you missed your calling.
Yeah. King of missed opportunities.
That's me.
But I never missed a reel change.
Never.
Okay, once.
Tell me. Tell me as a woman, as a beautiful woman. What do you think?
You think I might have a chance?
I mean, hypothetically.
Not with you, but just in general.
Do you think I'm...
You know, you think I'm...
I'm so fucking stupid.
Going on and on and on.
Hey, we gotta go.
No. Hey, come back.
We will.
Don't let him fall asleep, okay?
Be brave.
Come on.
It's dead.
I just put batteries in four minutes ago.
This'll do it.
It's right over here. Come on.
I must've checked 500 cars since this happened.
Goddamn if this isn't the only one with a battery that still works.
Why does this one work and all the others don't?
It's a Chevy.
There is no reason. All right?
It's random, you know.
Toss of a coin.
Why I'm still here and the sucker who was driving this boat isn't,
I don't know. I had light, he didn't?
Just tell me what I have to do.
Push!
Keep pushing.
You're fine.
You got a girl?
A what?
"A what?" Not a what, a girl.
A main squeeze.
I got a ma.
You got a ma.
Of course you got a ma, everybody's got a ma.
We all got a ma, but...
The Umbrellas of Cherbourg!
That's the movie that I'm gonna screen for her.
Catherine Deneuve.
The music, the colors...
She's gonna love it.
Paul.
Paul. Paul!
Paul! Wake up!
Put on... Put on a song.
- A what?
- Go put a song on for me.
- But Luke says...
- I don't care what Luke says.
Just go, give me one more song. Go ahead.
See if they got Forever by the Marvelettes.
They got it.
Play it.
Darling, forever
Forever
You can break my heart
I'll play the part of a fool
Just to be with you
Forever
Darling, forever
Forever
You can torment me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
If I
If I could be with you
I'll be your slave
For the rest of
Of my days
Love you more in so
So many ways
Just to be with you
Thrills me through and through
And darling, forever
Forever
James! James!
James! James!
James!
Paul! Come on, come on.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Hold up! Hold up!
It's just a few more blocks.
No, I've got to stop for a second.
My ankle. I just need a minute.
Hey, James.
James.
James!
James!
They're all dead.
Your son. Does he talk yet?
Manny, right?
Does he talk?
He kind of makes funny sounds.
He can nearly say mama.
And sometimes he'll...
He'll point at a light and he says, "Lye!
"Lye, Mama".
It's almost "light," but not really.
What's in Chicago?
Anna. My wife.
We're separated actually.
I left for my career and she stayed for hers.
She's still there, Luke.
Funny thing is,
I don't think she'd want to see me.
Even now.
You'll be together again.
You will.
I just... I just put fresh batteries in.
Just keep dying.
Oh, my God. Look!
Hey!
Come here.
- Hey, there.
- It's okay.
- Come here.
- Come here, it's all right.
It's all right, don't be afraid. Come here.
Come on.
Shit!
No! Come back!
Luke!
Luke, get up!
Hit the lights!
Hit the headlights!
Come on, hit the lights!
Hit the headlights!
Get out of there!
James.
Oh, no.
James!
James!
None of them work.
None of them work.
This is the only one that works.
Shit. Come on!
No, it doesn't work.
What are we gonna do?
Luke, they're here.
Come on.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
They're dimming.
James.
That's better.
Hold this steady.
- All right.
- All right. That's good. That's good.
Give me your lighter.
Come on! Come on! Give me your lighter.
- It's in the bar.
- What?
It's in the bar!
Where are you going?
Rosemary.
Whoa!
Hey, what are you doing?
Stay close.
- There's not enough light.
- Come on!
We can make it.
We can make it.
It's really close.
James.
Almost there!
This is it!
James!
James. Come...
James!
Here.
Paul.
James.
No! No!
No!
Who's there?
Stay away!
Stay away!
Stay away from me!
No!
I exist.
I exist. I exist. I exist. I exist.
James.
I exist.
I exist!
James, I exist!
I exist...
Paul.
Paul!
Paul!
Hold this.
How'd you know those matches were there?
I used to bum cigarettes off the duty nurse.
You worked here?
No.
Manny saved my life.
Made me want to clean up.
Made me want to live.
I can't lose him, Luke.
I can't.
This torch won't last.
We gotta go, Rosemary. Come on.
There's a storage room in the back.
There's alcohol.
For the needles.
Rubbing alcohol.
For the torch. Fuel, right?
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.
No, you rest your ankle.
You wait here. I'll go.
Manny.
Rosemary?
My baby?
Manny.
No. No.
Almost there.
I exist.
I exist.
James!
Hey!
Where's Paul?
He's gone. He's gone.
Rosemary?
Hey.
Hey, we're gonna make it.
All right?
Hey, we're gonna make it, all right?
But I need your help.
Okay?
Okay.
Come on, give me more slack.
There.
All right.
I gotta go down and prime that thing.
You're gonna have to turn the ignition on your own, all right?
I can't be alone, man.
- Listen, you're not alone.
- No, don't go!
- You're gonna leave, too!
- No. It's you and me now, buddy.
- All right? Hey.
- Don't go, man. Don't go.
Listen to me.
Okay? We're gonna see morning, I promise.
A storm passing.
- Right? Right?
- That's right.
That's right, a storm passing.
All right, when I say, "Now," turn the ignition.
Okay!
Now!
Come on.
Now!
Come on!
Now!
Come on! Come on! Shit.
I've gotta shut the hood.
You gotta keep your foot on the gas otherwise we're gonna lose power. Yeah?
Yeah.
Don't take it off.
Okay. Okay.
You did good back there.
So did you.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Go!
Mama.
James, the gas! Hey!
James! Hey!
What are you doing? Hey!
Shit!
James!
James, get back here!
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Fuck it.
James.
James.
Mom.
Mom. It's me.
Get in the truck!
I saw my mom.
Get in the fucking truck.
James! No!
James!
James!
James! James!
No!
Anna.
Luke!
My name is James Leary.
I exist.
I exist.
I exist.
I exist.
I exist!
I exist.
I exist.
I exist.
That's my bed.
You don't have to go.
Don't go.
I'm Briana.
I'm James.
It works?
It won't go out.
As long as there's day.
What's that?
Look!
I exist.
- I got you.
- No, no, no, no.
I got you.
I got you.
Okay, it's okay.
Okay.
Oh, god.
It's... it's okay.
- Oh, god.
- Come on.
Oh, god.
There you go.
They're all dead.
He killed them all.
I can't figure you people out.
Honey Island Swamp has been closed for decades and for good reason.
But every now and then, some stupid son-of-a-bitch thinks he knows better.
I knew.
Let me guess, you don't believe in ghosts.
You think Victor Crowley is a legend.
I went in there to find my family, my...
My brother and my father.
He killed them all.
What the hell were they doing in there?
Night fishing.
My daddy was a gator hunter.
He and my brother started pulling in twice their load once they start to hunt away from everybody else.
We needed the money after my momma passed away.
Oh, god.
Now I'm all alone.
Your daddy should have known better.
Hell, every hunter from around here knows not to go in that damn swamp.
I was telling 'em, I say,
"Stay the hell out!"
Well, they all call me crazy.
They think I'm sick in the head.
Here, you drink this.
It's nice and warm.
First things first.
We gotta find out wherever it is you're living and get you there.
We're gonna get you a doctor.
I think I should go to the police.
The police?
What, and fill out one of the missing reports, like the hundreds of others filled out in this area?
You'll never hear back from them.
But I know where their bodies are.
Yeah, right.
Those big city cops are hightailing down here and-and-and they'll find all that evidence before the wildlife eats it.
What am I supposed to do?
Never come back this way again.
Hell, you're a lucky girl.
You got out of there alive and with all your pieces!
Look, miss, what... what's your name?
Marybeth.
Marybeth Dunston.
Holy Christ, your Samson's kid.
Yes.
Get out!
- What?
- Get out of my house right now!
Get out, now!
You knew my daddy?
No.
But I know what your daddy did and I want nothing to do with it.
I keep myself to myself, and that ghost leaves me be.
But I can't have nothing to do with you.
Get out!
But how am I supposed to get home?
Out that door is Lodge Road.
You take it a half a mile down, you're gonna find a gas station, you get a ride from there, but I can't have nothing to do with you.
Get out!
I... but l... I don't understand.
You get out of my house,
Marybeth Dunston.
What's going on?
You want answers, you go see Reverend Zombie.
Now, miss, you get far, far away from here or I swear to God
I will shoot you dead.
I didn't do nothing wrong.
I didn't know who she was.
It don't count.
All right, let's take a look at tonight's haul.
What do we got here?
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's it.
Play.
Man
Let's see something.
It's show time, huh?
- Whoo!
- There you go.
- Wait. Is this gonna be on
Bayou Beavers?
Score.
MAN
Let's see what you can do.
Good, 'cause
I want my daddy to see this.
Whoo!
Fuck you, Dad!
I hope that you're watching this...
Oh, yeah.
...because you love Danielle more than me and I hope that Bill at the office--
MAN
Roll back, relax a little bit maybe show us the other side of Cindy--there we go.
Oh, you look fantastic.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
MAN
No, you don't know me.
- Maybe put your hair up in a--
- No, no! I know you.
You're-you're my History teacher from fifth grade.
- Oh, no.
- Mr. Barrett.
- I'm Mr. Shapiro
- Yeah--
MAN
Hey, where are you going?
Mister, leave me alone.
MAN Come on.
Why don't you to lift up that shirt.
Let's see what you got going on under there.
Dude, I'm 14.
Oh, that ain't right.
MAN
Good, good.
Okay, when I say action, you girls drop the towels and, uh, start washing each other.
Yeah, no.
MAN
Okay, girls. Drop the towels.
Drop the towels.
Touch Walking Hepatitis over here?
I'll pass.
Well, at least I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Hermaphrodite, big word of the day for you.
What is a hermaphrodite, darling?
Why would I tell you if I just said it?
Of course, I knew what it is.
- You probably don't know what it is.
- Well, why don't you go ahead and explain it?
Why would I need to explain it?
You probably don't even know what it is.
Why don't we do it on the count of three together?
- Fine.
- Okay?
One, two, three.
A person who has a penis and a vagina.
Ew.
I didn't do nothin'!
I didn't even know who that girl was!
What do you want?
Hi.
Um, I need to talk to you about something?
Come back some other time.
I'm busy
When?
Next month.
No.
I need to talk to you.
Now.
All right, all right.
Come in. Come in.
This better be important.
I'm a busy guy.
Jack Cracker sent me.
What?
We're so scared, it was terrifying.
I'm never going skiing again.
That old whack job?
So what do you need from me?
Everybody's dead.
Last night in Honey Island Swamp--
Honey Island Swamp.
Were you on that tour?
Yeah.
And how did you know?
What happened?
The boat driver was an idiot.
He got us stuck, and Crowley massacred everybody.
But I got away.
Shaun, the boat driver, is he dead?
You knew him?
Shoo!
He worked for me.
That was one of my boats.
I don't understand.
Shut up.
No one's been able to run tours out of this swamp for years, not since I've had this shop.
Ever.
Not me, not anybody.
So I was forced to run tours at the back door of one of my other shops.
Times are tough and money is money.
You sound just like my daddy.
Who's your father?
Samson Dunston.
Samson Dunston.
Samson Dunston's kid?
Yes.
Well, how is old Samson doing?
He's dead.
Grace.
Crowley got him and my brother too, and then Jack Cracker freaked out on me.
Practically shot me when he found out who I was.
He said that you would be able to tell me what my daddy did.
Samson Dunston.
- Samson Dunston's gone.
- Please.
What do you know?
Same thing that everybody else whispers about these backwoods,
I suppose.
Only I was around when it actually happened.
When what happened?
A long time ago before you were born when I was just a boy.
There was a man named
Thomas Crowley.
He lived out there in
Honey Island Swamp with his wife Shyann.
They lived alone.
No kids, just the two of them.
Shyann was sick, some sort of stomach cancer eating her up slowly and gradually taking its time.
Now the way I always heard it
Shyann had a nurse named Lena a beautiful Cajun woman who would come by to tend to her.
And over the long months of Shyann's passing,
Thomas and Lena got closer.
Too close.
Call Thomas Crowley a cheat, call him an infidel, but given the circumstances, the entire situation was nothing but sad and tragic.
With his wife as good as dead for so many years, it was only a matter of time until the pain and suffering of his own emotions needed to be addressed.
It took almost a year of Thomas and Lena carrying on in secret before the day came when Shyann finally found peace from her suffering.
But the moment was not so much a release as it was a nightmare.
No!
She put a curse on Thomas Crowley and his mistress, Lena, a curse that would not only damn them but the bastard child that was already growing in Lena's belly.
No.
They say that on the day
Victor Crowley was born, the swamp mourned.
The trees wept.
The wildlife became sickly and died.
His presence was like a pestilence that turned the area into death.
Come on.
There it is.
Push, push.
Push. There it is.
Come on.
Come on. One more.
Here it comes.
One more, one more.
Victor Crowley was born ridden with grotesque tumors, disease and pain.
Let me see.
Let me see it!
A living monster.
And Lena...
Some say she died the moment she laid eyes on her child.
Now the legend would have you believe that Mr. Crowley kept his son hidden away to protect him, but what he was really hiding was his mistake, his infidelity and his curse.
Over the years, Thomas Crowley learned to love his monster of a son.
With just the two of them being hidden away, he made his peace with God.
And on that fateful
Halloween night...
Thomas tried to save his son by chopping through the door with a hatchet and by accident, killed his only son.
Get out here!
Get out here and get what's coming to you!
You can't hide forever!
You killed my son.
You killed my son.
You killed my son.
The children responsible hid behind their parents, denied everything and left Thomas Crowley to live out the rest of his days in anguish.
You killed my son.
Years later, he finally passed and the torture of this life was over.
But Victor Crowley would become one of the most tragic and heartbreaking tales of Louisiana.
A man trapped in the night he was killed, still out there, wandering the swamp each night trying to find his daddy.
No one knows the body count, but for years after he died, fishermen, gator hunters, and those who were just too foolish to heed the tales, all disappeared in that swamp mutilated, murdered, massacred and torn to pieces by the ghost of Victor Crowley.
What does that have to do with me?
Your father, Samson, was one of the three kids who murdered Victor Crowley.
An accident, yes, but a tragedy that has left
Honey Island Swamp cursed with the ghost of
Victor Crowley forever.
Uh.
I... I never--
Of course.
How could you know?
How do you know that my dad was involved?
Because if I had been brave enough,
I would have been out there too.
I'm an old acquaintance of Samson.
- When Crowley came after us last night--
- You saw him?
Yes.
He looked at me like he knew me.
Perhaps he could sense who you really were.
Perhaps it was all on your mind.
Victor Crowley is what's known in the paranormal world as a repeater.
His tragic and untimely death has left him forced to relive that moment night after night, over and over.
All he knows is the fear and revenge towards anybody who steps foot in that swamp.
You knew all this was real yet you still sent a tour boat full of innocent people in there?
For what?
For what?
For money?
Shaun.
He wasn't supposed to get that close.
He wasn't supposed to stop for nothing.
Now I've had boats go into that swamp for months now, two months now, with no worries.
Besides you knew the legend.
You went in there knowing the story as did your father,
I went in-- who more than anybody should have known better.
I went in there to find them and I did!
Not many people have seen the face of Victor Crowley and lived to tell about it.
Consider yourself lucky.
Lucky?
My family is gone!
I'm sorry for your loss.
- Take me back there.
- What?
I can't leave them there.
Please.
Please.
I just wanna take them home.
What you want is revenge.
It's a bad idea, Marybeth Dunston.
Bad idea.
Please.
Please.
I just wanna bury my family.
And if I can take that monster out with me, then all the better.
You can't kill him.
He'll just be reborn.
He's supposed to return to the state he was when he was killed.
You can't kill a ghost.
Or maybe I can't.
Or maybe I can.
But I am gonna bury that hatchet deep into his fucking face!
Or would you rather I go to the police and tell them about your swamp tour business?
Maybe tell them where to find the bodies of a boat full of tourists that you sent in there illegally, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.
Yes?
You want revenge on Victor Crowley?
I want you to find it.
So you'll take me back in there?
But I have some conditions.
We're not going in there alone.
We need help.
We need guns.
And there's a few specific people that I feel safer having along.
Fine, if you take me back in there tonight.
Now, you meet me here at 2 o'clock.
I have some phone calls to make.
I'm gonna gather together a little hunting expedition of sorts.
With that ghost gone,
I can clear that swamp.
You know, I don't care about your swamp tour business.
I don't care about your money.
I just want to bring my family home.
- If you think that bring--
- I said... yes.
But you know, I think it would be better if you didn't go in there alone.
Do you have somebody you can bring, boyfriend or an uncle perhaps?
I'm not bringing anybody else
I know into this.
Uh-uh.
I'd feel better if you brought somebody, if you brought another family member with you.
No.
Then no deal.
So if I bring my uncle back, then you will take us?
That's what I said.
I'll be back at 2:00.
I'll be here.
Justin!
Justin!
Get your butt down here!
Yeah, boss?
When were you gonna tell me that your brother didn't bring the boat back?
Oh, he didn't?
So Shaun didn't bring the boat back last night?
Uh-uh.
Look, he's just new at this.
I'm sure things are fine... he's probably got the boat back by now.
That was your shift.
He was covering for you, okay?
He didn't bring the boat back and everything's not all right.
Why?
What... what's wrong?
We gotta go out there and recover my boat.
Shaun's still in the swamp?
Apparently.
Is he all right?
I'm sure he will be all right.
I need you to go out and organize a group of hunters and fishermen, people that know the way around the swamp.
I got a proposition to make them and you make sure that this name is on the list.
We're going on a little expedition.
Is this like a publicity thing for the shop?
Something like that.
Hello?
Who's there?
Hello?
Marybeth? Samson?
Uncle Bob?
I'll be right down.
Your father was a good man, you know that.
He's always been my best friend.
Even all those years I lived up north, we'd talk all the time.
Reverend Zombie said dad was one of the people responsible for Victor Crowley's death.
Is that true?
Reverend Zombie?
Why are you talking to that low-life?
He's a thief and crook with his bogus voodoo shops and his fake souvenirs.
Well, he said that he knew the people that were involved.
He's full of horse-shit.
- Reverend Zombie said--
- Reverend Zombie said!
Why do you call him that?
His name is Clive Washington for Christ's sake.
The only thing he's reverend of is being an asshole.
Did you know that
Victor Crowley was real?
- He's not real.
- I saw him.
He murdered everyone in front of me.
Let the police handle this.
- First things--
- No!
So you think that I'm lying?
Let's take a ride.
We can go to the hospital and you can tell the cops all about it.
I'm going back to the swamp with Reverend Zombie.
Over my dead body are you going to that god damn swamp.
Now you listen to me, young lady.
With your father gone,
I'm responsible for you now and I absolutely forbid you to have anything to do with him or that swamp!
He suggested that I bring you along.
- He did, didn't he?
- Mm-hmm.
Come with me.
You'll see Victor Crowley is real.
Let's take a ride.
Can we wait?
Please.
I will go to the police.
I will do whatever it is that you think that we need to do.
I just... I just really need to be alone for a bit.
Come on.
Please.
Please, Uncle Bob, just a few hours.
All right,
I'll be back in an hour.
I'll call the police myself.
- Get to the bottom of this.
- Okay.
Marybeth, please promise me you'll stay away from Reverend Zombie.
I promise.
Ah-ha, come on in.
I see you!
Welcome to Reverend Zombie's
House of Voodoo.
Grab a complimentary Chips Ahoy and take a seat.
Hurry.
S'il vous plait.
The meeting is about to start.
Yes. Ha-ha.
Bonjour, monsieur.
Welcome to the House of Voodoo.
Take a seat and don't forget we have a sale on charms and potions today only.
Drop the phony accent, asshole.
I ain't no god damn tourist.
Chips Ahoy?
Fuck off.
Hey.
Ah, he-hey, uh, did you wanna get on the mailing list?
Um, you can just gimme your number, I mean.
I mean you don't have to gimme but you...
Slut.
Layton?
Oh, my god,
I didn't expect to see you here.
Come on, Avery.
What?
What are you doing here?
They said 500 bucks.
Why not?
Okay, so this is how we say hello now?
Please.
Your phone don't get messages anymore either?
You know why I'm here?
I need the $500 to help pay for my wedding.
My wedding, Avery.
I am not getting into this with you.
I'm single.
Ho, ho, ho.
Tres bein, tres bein!
Welcome.
All right, everyone.
Thanks or as the French say, merci for coming down here on such short notice.
I know you are all busy people.
Yes?
Hey, man, what's the deal with cookies?
Is it just like one each or could we get some more or what's up?
I have more cookies but first, can we, uh...
Okay, so do we get them now or like after the meeting?
Or... what's the time stamp on them cookies there?
Fine.
There it is.
Bon appétit.
Good afternoon, everybody.
Good to see so many friends with familiar faces here today.
John.
Cleatus.
Trent.
I brought y'all here today to make you an offer, to offer you a job.
It's a quick gig.
We do it tonight.
And for those of you that join me, there's $500 in it for you.
And I assume the money will be in cash?
Not that any of us here don't trust a check from you, it's that we really want to get the money.
In cash, when the job is done.
Last night, I lost one of my tour boats out there in that swamp, so I'm putting together a group of sorts to go in there, retrieve my boat, and in addition, go on a little night hunt.
Why do you need this many people to find a boat?
If you stop interrupting me,
I'll tell you.
Now, of course, I'm not offering you y'all $500 just to retrieve a boat.
I'm gonna be honest with you.
There's more to it and it could be dangerous.
Hey man, do y'all got any milk?
- What?
- Milk, man.
Milk for the cookies, man.
Milk. Milk?
No milk.
We're going to
Honey Island swamp.
Honey Island's closed.
We can't even go in there.
I know that.
That's why I'm offering y'all $500, and in addition, I'm willing to take on full legal responsibility in case there'll be any trouble with the authorities.
So it won't be any risk to any of y'all.
What exactly are we gonna be hunting?
I'm getting to that.
As you know that swamp has been closed and condemned for too many years, and it's been crippling my tourism business and it's been stopping those of you who make your living hunting an entire area rich with wildlife.
So I'm proposing we put a little hunt, go in there and prove once and for all that there's nothing to fear.
What are we hunting?
Victor Crowley.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Now hold on, now.
Hold on!
Now, listen to me.
Listen to me.
Now if there really is some maniac living up there, we just go in there, take them down and make the area safe again.
All right, now, y'all know that's just a story so we go in there and put an end to all this swamp water stupidity.
Not l.
Now, now, now, now.
Come on. Come on, everyone...
Hey, come on now, big guy.
Trent, where you going?
You scared of something?
You know I ain't scared of nothing, but I ain't about to go messing around in that swamp with a crew of stomp-jumping pecker woods for no 500 bucks.
Hey, I need you, all right?
Now you're the best shot around here.
You know that.
That's why I called for you.
I ain't riskin' my hide for 500 stinking dollars.
Five hundred dollars up front just for you.
Clive, you know my history.
I don't want no more trouble.
I also know that after your last DUI,
Joan left you, took the house, half of everything you have, hanging on a hook.
That ain't the history I'm talking about.
One thousand dollars cash,
$500 right now up front,
$500 in the morning.
One night and we'll all be together, huh?
Anything bad goes down, we... leave.
Hmm?
Yeah.
May I help you?
Oh, you must be Marybeth's uncle.
I'm Reverend Zombie.
I was a friend of Samson, but you and I never officially met.
I don't care to know you.
I'm here to look after the young lady.
I'm sorry.
I... I just need--
I'll do this with you if... if it's what you need to do right now,
I'll do it with you.
But then we gather up your father and your brother and we come back here.
No more of this Victor Crowley shit.
You gotta listen to me.
You can't leave my side, you can't leave my sight, and when I say it's time to go, we leave.
Thank you.
Hey, man.
Who's Victor Crowley?
Well, he's nothing, a local boogeyman story about a retarded maniac who haunts Honey Island.
People just use it to keep kids away from the swamp.
You mean like a Jason Voorhees or something?
Something like that.
When I was eight,
I lived in this town called Glen Echo.
- Our ghost story is about this man named Leslie Vernon--
- Shh.
Now that we've weeded out the gullible, the cowards,
I could finish my offer.
Five hundred dollars just for joining me for the night, bringing back my boat.
Five thousand dollars for the head of Victor Crowley.
Yeah, but how are we suppose to know if we found him if he's not a real dude?
If you find him, then you'll know.
God damn, would you look at all the gators around here?
It's like a fucking farm.
I guess that's what
Reverend Zombie's talking about.
Look at all these.
Nobody here to take 'em.
Hell, I ain't leaving here empty handed, that's for sure.
What's your name?
Chad.
Cleatus.
Really?
Yeah, I know.
My parents were true rednecks.
I got a brother named Cash.
It's cooler than Cleatus.
No offense.
None taken.
But Chad, that's, uh, that's a real douche bag name.
You know that, right?
It's better than Skip.
That's my little brother.
Chad and Skip?
God damn, you two must have had your asses handed to you in school.
Yeah, we did.
So how come we don't get ride in the boat with them boys up there?
I take my own boat wherever I go.
What the hell for?
In case I hook up.
Who are you gonna hook up with out here?
Her.
Aw, fuck her.
Biscuits and chicken and gravy, and biscuits and chicken and gravy, and chickens with the biscuits on the gravy with the biscuits and the chicken.
Want some biscuit for the biscuit is me.
So what's with a whole lynch mob?
Safety in numbers.
I know most of these folks think this whole story is a joke, but if something bad goes down,
I'd rather be surrounded by the big guns.
Wouldn't you?
I thought you said you couldn't kill him?
Ah, but if the legend is true, then there really is a ghost or maybe not.
I hurt him last night.
I shot him, I stabbed him,
I burned him.
He kept coming.
But you hurt him.
He went down every time.
He felt pain.
Then maybe the thing is to hit him even worse.
Hit him so hard, take his head off, so he can't come back.
What did you call him, a repeater?
But doesn't that mean that he will just come back again the next night?
I don't have answers, only theories.
But I have to assume that, uh, if we take off his head, then he can't come back at all.
All these people are in danger and they don't even realize it.
Boss.
He-he--hey, boss!
Did Shaun get off the boat?
I'm sure they're okay.
That's why we're here.
Sup?
Hi.
I'm Vernon.
Marybeth.
What you doing out here in this bullshit?
I'm not looking for a date,
I can tell you that much.
Ooh, no disrespect,
I'm just trying to be friendly.
Sorry.
I'm just having a really bad day.
Well, what you need to do is turn that frown upside down.
Oh, thanks, Vernon.
Make out with me.
What?
On this boat, in front of all these people?
Yeah.
Don't.
Okay, man, okay.
There're some freaks on this boat, man.
What's up with that
Blair witch, man?
I'd tap that but she probably got cobwebs sealing it up.
Even if I did hit that, a bunch of bats probably come flying out of it.
Voodoo.
Magic.
Just keep your eyes open.
Open.
This will be a long night.
Man, it is dead in here.
Where we're going, it gets much thicker.
It's almost nightfall.
Let's move!
- Hey, how much farther to the house?
- What house?
I'm not exactly sure.
This all looks the same to me.
We didn't walk far.
I'm just not exactly sure where we got off.
Why'd you guys get off the boat?
Well, I don't wanna linger.
- Let's get to the house.
- What house?
My daddy and my brother are in the shed.
Why were they in the shed?
What house?
It's scary out here.
Oh, that's just 'cause people want you to think it's scary.
It's no different than any other swamp.
Have you noticed that there's hardly even any birds?
Doesn't matter.
But don't let that clown spook you.
All you gotta do, hang out here for a few hours, collect our money, and go home.
Screw that.
I'm taking out that
Crowley monster guy.
5000 bucks,
I could be out of debt.
Ha! Out of all these guys, you'll get him?
I'm a better shot than you.
That's not true.
Okay, Garden District Fair, two years ago.
I was drunk and I let you win.
Right, kinda like how you let me win at air hockey and at pool?
I was sick.
You're adorable.
Fucking mosquitoes!
Hey, man.
I got some spray if you want.
Yeah.
Sweet. Thanks.
Do you believe the whole ghost story about this place?
I believe there was a story, but I believe there's a ghost that can actually hurt somebody.
Right.
Look, I've been thinking if a ghost takes on physical presence and manifests itself, then what's to stop it from going after somebody?
Damn, man, you need to stop watching The Syfy Channel.
If that ghost does manifest his ass,
I'll shoot his head off.
Hey, man, you want some bug spray?
Man, he don't talk a lot, huh?
What, who, John?
No, man he's a riot.
He used to do stand-up down at
Fancy Wigs, man. Real hilarious.
- Seriously?
- No.
Hey, man, careful with 'em cigarettes.
They'll kill you, you know.
Shut up, Chad.
Dicks!
Well, where the hell are we going?
I don't know, okay.
We came in a different way.
Just how much farther in you expect us to go, little girl?
Yeah. I'd like to stay closer to the boats.
Uh, we came in through there, so the boats are a straight shot back.
So what now?
Let's surround the area, if Victor Crowley really does exist, this is where we find him.
So is this some kind of
Victor Crowley call or something?
So, what, we break up into groups?
No.
That's a bad idea.
No, no. He's right.
That way, we can cover more ground.
All right now, if you see that monster out there, shoot.
Now, wait just a damn minute.
We don't want a bunch of spooked people walking around this swamp shooting at everything.
Man, who you calling spooked?
I'm going with the big guy.
The fuck you are, boy.
I'm fixin' to keep a eye on my money.
Come on, let's find that shed and get out of here.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
What's the plan?
The plan?
We meet back at the boat at sun up.
And if you do find that monster, bring back his head... 5K.
Trent, you come with us.
What do you want to do?
Stick with these guys tonight.
Wait here till tomorrow and get out of here.
Well, all right, this hunter's Daddy Eddy.
I don't want to hang out with these idiots all night.
All right, come on.
Whoa-whoa, hey, man, what, you're going to take the pretty thing in the swamp with you?
Yeah, man. We're cool.
Thanks.
Oh, okay, I get it.
Y'all a couple or something, huh?
My bad.
Hey man, I got an idea.
Why don't we all just split up?
Hey, better yet, let's just go skinny dipping.
Hey, I don't know about you.
I'm gonna go catch me a gator, hang out down by the boats.
Well, I like the idea of sticking near them boats.
I don't want nobody leaving without me.
Stick with me, pal.
Make it worth our while.
And then, it was just us.
Are you scared, man?
Boo!
Ow.
Damn it!
Swamp overflowing with gators and I can't hit one!
You gotta lead it more.
Dude, I know how to hunt.
Yeah.
That's why you keep missing.
So, uh, are we supposed to stand around here all night?
Unless you want to go sniffing around in there with them assholes.
No, no.
I'm good here but, man, 5000 bucks...
To hunt down a children story?
Good luck!
And the only reason Zombie's even offering that reward, because there ain't no Victor Crowley.
I mean, we're gonna end up staying up all night just so we can go back and declare the swamp safe and be able to start up his tours or some bullshit.
How do you know the story ain't real?
Please.
If that story was real...
I mean, if I even thought that story was real, my ass wouldn't be here right now.
All right, see how he's moving to the right?
Shut up.
Two feet to the right.
Shut up.
Yeah! Whoo!
Did you see that?
Wait. Shut up.
Did you hear something?
- Yeah, I heard that gator decide to come home with me, that's what I heard.
- No! Shh!
Listen.
Oh, come on.
All right, we hear you Vernon.
It's funny.
That was Vernon?
Of course, it was.
I see him.
Shut the fuck up.
It's out in front of us.
Vernon?
Cut it out or you're gonna get hurt.
Yeah.
I'm serious.
Knock it off right now or you're gonna get shot.
I'm serious now.
Oh!
Oh, fuck!
No! No! No!
No!
Hey, boss, hold on.
Come on.
What are we really doing here?
We're gonna go through there, get the people that were on that boat, and we're gonna bring them back home.
Come on.
I'm not an idiot, okay.
Why do you need all these people?
Why all the guns?
All right, listen to me, Justin.
Listen to me.
If what the girl is saying is correct and Victor Crowley is still out there,
I know how to get rid of him.
I know how to end the curse.
And how is that?
- You see those two right there?
- Yeah.
They were out here the night that Crowley got murdered.
Oh, the night the house got lit on fire?
Yes.
There were three of them.
Samson, the girl's father, was the other one.
So that means there's only two more to go before his revenge is satisfied and the curse will be lifted, and the swamp is mine.
Wait. That's... that's like murder.
Am I hurting anybody?
Did I twist anybody's arm to come out here?
They came here on their own free will.
Yeah, because you bribed them.
You got a problem with this, Justin?
Do you have a problem with me?
I just...
No.
Look, I just wanna find Shaun and get the hell out of here.
Is Shaun all right?
I don't know.
But you wouldn't tell me the truth if you did know, would you?
Look at me.
The girl doesn't know what happened to Shaun either.
The group got split up.
But I'm sure he's out there somewhere.
He'll be fine. Trust me.
Now we all have to stick together.
Everything is going to be fine.
He's a tough kid.
He ain't that tough.
Come on.
Come on.
Yeah. Ah.
You're not the least bit creeped out here?
You're really freaked out, huh?
Well, yeah.
You don't need to be scared.
Besides, if a monster comes to get you, we've got guns, right?
I guess.
Remember... remember in high school, when I told you I couldn't get my driver's license because I was sick and couldn't make it to the DMV?
Yeah.
I lied.
And I failed.
Guy told me to parallel park and I totally nailed the other car.
Where did that come from?
I don't know.
I guess l... I just felt like saying it.
Want to know something?
What?
I knew.
How?
Remember my Aunt May?
She worked at the DMV.
She told me the whole thing.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Then why didn't you ever call me on it?
'Cause I had a crush on you and I felt bad, I guess.
Stop.
No.
Wait, you know
I still care about you, right?
I don't... I don't... I don't know what's going on.
Fuck it.
Here!
It's here.
They're in here.
They were here.
Both of them, their bodies were right here.
Shh, it's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.
Are you happy now?
Hey, I'm just trying to help.
Look, I'm sure they were here, but, look, there's nothing here now!
They were right there.
Well then, maybe... maybe it was a different shed.
- Maybe you were just scared.
- No, I know what I saw.
I saw them with my own eyes.
Crowley, maybe... maybe he took them inside the house.
Marybeth!
Hey, the girl's had quite a scare...
Brave little gal.
Hey, you just can't run up there!
Oh, let them go.
Boss, if you don't mind,
I'd really like to just find my brother and get the fuck out of here.
No, it's safer if we stick together.
Shaun!
- Shaun!
- Son,
I'm gonna give you about one more second to knock that shit off.
Fuck.
You like that?
Yes.
Yes. Fuck.
Oh, yeah.
Did you miss that?
I did.
I really did.
Oh, how much?
How much you missed it?
The most.
The most amount.
You like this better than ice cream?
Yep.
Oh, yeah.
- Better than chocolate ice cream?
- Yep.
Fuck chocolate ice cream.
Oh, yeah.
You like this better than Jesus?
That's just... that's not appropriate.
Oh, you like this better than Baby Jesus?
Ah, about... about an equal amount.
Oh, yeah.
You love me?
What?
Do you love me?
Yep.
How much do you love me?
Yep.
- What? I can't hear you.
- Huh?
Tell me you love me.
I love you.
Say it.
Say you love me.
Say it!
- Tell me you love me!
- I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Yeah, you do.
Oh!
Easy!
C'mon!
C'mon!
Come on.
You didn't fall asleep on me again, did you?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Enough!
Enough of this insanity.
Come on.
They're here.
They have to be here somewhere.
Come on, we're leaving right now.
Please, please, Uncle Bobby, you have to believe me.
Well, then, we'll come back tomorrow during the day.
We'll bring the sheriff with us.
Boss!
The sheriff isn't gonna be here...
I really wanna get out of here now!
Not yet.
Please.
I'm fucking scared.
Then get back to the boat.
Can I get the keys back?
And leave me here?
No. I won't leave.
I'll wait.
The hell you will.
I'm with your boy.
We're looking for serious trouble being in here.
It's too late.
Shut the door!
Shut the fucking door!
Come on, give me a hand.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Come on, come on.
Come on, man.
Come on push, push fast.
What the hell have you done?
Back off of me, old man.
You're gonna get us all killed?
You?
You're blaming me?
What?
What are you talking about?
Y'all better shot the fuck up!
Hey, man, you hear that?
Hey, if somebody's joking around out there, this shit ain't funny.
We will shoot you.
Show yourself or we will shoot your head off.
Last warning, asshole!
Shots fired.
Maybe they got him.
No, no.
Stay with me.
No.
Look, I can't. Look, I can't.
I can't be in here.
Or I need to get back to the boat.
I just wanna find Shaun and go home.
Shaun... is he, is he dead?
They are all dead.
And you lied?
I told him the truth.
You knew my brother was dead!
Quiet, kid!
All right, all I know is what that crazy gal said.
For all I know he could still be out there somewhere.
He's not.
Well, what if you shot one of the other guys, man?
Hello?
What the fuck?!
Oh, shit!
We're fucked in here!
We're fucked.
We're so fucked!
Listen to me you little piece of shit.
Now you stay with me and you don't do anything stupid.
Now if I'm right and Crowley gets his revenge on those two people that killed him.
He's gonna have his peace.
This will all be over and we'll be rich.
- What if--
- Don't be a fool.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Give me your gun.
No!
Do you see anything out there?
No.
But I find it hard to believe that this door is the only way in.
I'll scope it out.
Now, you listen to me.
I want you to hide.
I'm not hiding.
That's enough.
Now you hide!
Come on.
Come on!
I've never been so fucking scared in my life.
I'm sorry about your brother.
You could have told me earlier.
I thought Zombie would have told you.
Are you positive?
But are you sure he's dead?
Why the hell would you come back here?
I don't understand.
My family is gone.
I have nothing.
I wanna see Crowley die.
- But if he's a ghost--
- I hurt him last night.
If he can feel pain, then he can die.
What did he say to you?
I heard him say something about "those two"?
He seems to think that Trent and that guy with you, your uncle...
Bob?
He says that they're with your father when they killed Victor Crowley years ago.
What?
He thinks that if Victor Crowley has his revenge on them that the curse will be lifted and he'll just go away, and they will be safe.
That's why he brought us here?
I don't know shit.
- All I know is--
- Uncle Bob!
Hey, no! Hey!
Spiders.
Oh, shit.
Oh, please, spiders.
Please.
Oh, fuck!
Uncle Bob!
Uncle Bob!
It's a trap!
What?
Reverend Zombie, he's trying to get--
He's in the house!
Wait, no!
No, no, wait! Wait!
Just kill me!
Oh... Oh, God!
Uncle Bob, please!
Don't go!
This is what he wants.
Please listen to me.
Help!
Please help me!
Help me!
Wait.
Come on, get up.
Come on.
Uncle Bob, get up.
Hurry!
We have to get out of here.
Get up. Run!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to save you.
Yeah, you fuck!
No, please!
Uncle Bob!
Uncle Bob!
Put her down!
What are you doing?
Please!
Oh, God!
Please stop!
I'm trying to save you.
- I know you were gonna kill him.
- No.
Listen to me!
Listen to me.
He's going to kill you.
You, you're gonna kill him!
No, you're gonna kill him.
- No!
- Don't lock me in here!
Uncle Bob!
No, please!
Don't leave me.
- Wait!
- You want him to get you too?
- All right.
- You wanna be safe, don't you?
Come on, come on.
Uncle Bob!
Zombie!
Zombie, you can't leave me with this thing!
- Uncle Bob!
- You gotta help me!
Come back!
Zombie!
Come on you hatchet-faced fuck!
Oh, God!
Uncle Bob!
Now, now, little girl.
It's almost over.
It's almost all over.
No!
Now, it's all over, little girl.
It's all over.
Three children set that house on fire decades ago, three children murdered
Victor Crowley,
Trent, your father, and your father's brother, your uncle.
The only way to rid this swamp of that ghost's curse forever is to let him have revenged on the men that killed him.
You see?
You see!
It's over!
Victor Crowley is gone.
Gone!
The swamp is mine.
You're a murderer.
You never wanted to help me.
You killed all those innocent people.
No, no, no.
Victor Crowley murdered those people.
I just happened to survive.
I'm gonna tell the police what you did.
I'm gonna tell everybody.
That's where you're wrong,
Marybeth Dunston.
Well, there's something that you got wrong.
What?
That wasn't my real uncle.
Bob was my daddy's best friend.
My daddy's brother died from leukemia when I was 12.
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me.
Die, you motherfucker!
Go to hell!
Fuck you!

13 Hrs.
Hello, Duncan.
- Yes.
You did not have to wait on me.
- Hi, Sarah.
I hope that on the highway not too busy.
After such a long flight, I started
I have to worry.
No problems.
I have it easy.
Sit down.
I have made a casserole.
No, I've had enough,
I've already eaten on the plane.
Let me pour you a glass of wine, he's very good.
Relive your scoutingsdag you again?
- No, no.
Richard Ardis that is broken, the best thing then.
And how is it in the United States?
I've been promoted.
And I can a nice apartment and can afford to cancel my second job.
You know your mother and I love you help if you need money.
Thanks, but you have me in the past enough help.
And how are refurbishing, it seems a bit delayed.
Things do not go as planned.
The sale was canceled, but temporary.
And so I have not come this way.
And where is the terrible trio?
- They are in the barn ... with friends, probably trying
Stephen to his jeep to repair.
It's just a waste of my money.
I am also on 50 and go see do not break after every 500 meters.
And mother?
It is towards Edinburgh.
No time for this type of pipeline Contributor, even on a Friday night.
But she's here on Sunday and she can t wait to see you.
You look tired.
Why do not you bright and early to bed? I make sure the boys do a bit quiet.
This is an excellent idea.
Perhaps you young brothers their little sister need if the need is great.
I will see, I play it for mother for once.
I know you will.
Good night.
- Good night.
Sarah ...
Add the next time not so long about it.
Okay, I promise.
Back home.
Come on guys.
Come on guys, where are you now.
Sorry guys, your turn is over.
Look who's here is the first class whore has finally arrived.
Why, hello half sister.
Hello stranger.
- Hi Stephen.
Emily ...
Hi Sister!
- Hello Charlie.
How's my brother?
- Much better now that I see you.
Sarah, remember me?
Give me a hug.
Hi Gary ... still the charmer, eh?
And still single?
Frank told me you would rejoice us with your presence.
And I heard you had trouble again
The jeep, for the umpteenth time?
Oh yeah, you know.
At least you're for a change once home, for whatever reason.
And how is life today in L.A,
Sarah? Pay the street still good?
No, sorry, it's completely normal today.
It will at least be better if other things, anyway.
Or you just missed all this beauty here?
No, they just missed me.
There is no woman who is my back can resist.
I do not think they keep that kind.
Join us.
Yeah, why not?
- Good, good girl.
Now I feel really one of the boys.
- Yes, what exactly?
Sarah ... just say Gary and help him out of his masturbation agony once and for all.
Doug, I knew that somewhere would be it is the sky.
As always, hello blue-eyed.
Yes, and as always, hides Doug here for all his wild women.
That is nasty.
Another half point then?
- Give me that.
And where is Luke?
He's recovering, but guys?
- Together with Homer.
Restoring what?
That it is better to ask Dougie.
It comes from a full inhalation of the weed called jammagamlak.
So, Luke was able to get some fuck.
Not bad for a thirteen year old.
So, where is he?
He uitgevloerd.
- Totally exhausted.
Hey baby.
You're big.
How do you feel?
I heard you've had your first flying lesson.
- Maybe.
Homer at any rate.
We call him now stoner.
Hello.
Why do not you lie in bed in the house?
Mom and Dad had a big fight.
What was that about?
- I do not know, Sarah.
Dad shouted about accounts and whether she had an affair.
Why do not you go to bed, and then I get up tomorrow.
You promise?
You, will not leave us again to leave behind?
No, I promise, I'm here for a few weeks.
Why do not you sleep,
I will take with me stoner.
It will do him good to get some fresh to get air.
Go ahead, kid.
I'm not lying, I'm not lying.
I swear on my mother's life.
- Yes, if they really were.
That is the way to say, I am a gentleman to so to speak.
Everyone has a purpose, eh Charlie.
That's too much information about the sex life of my brother.
Okay, okay, let me tell you.
You can not even play with a pig, Gary.
- Julie is her name, she worked at J & D.
Is that with that mustache?
- No, the transvestite before surgery.
Fuck you say, it's really a lot.
She has an ass to be proud and big tits like you've never seen before.
My goodness.
- Sorry Sarah.
What do you mean? What is wrong with mine?
They're just not as nice as mine.
- No, no, sorry for my language.
Your breasts are fine, they are fine.
They are actually pretty nice.
Of course, I compare them to Emily.
- Gary!
We are in the pub and we got to talking, and asked her if she wanted to see my new engine.
So I went for it and before I knew it
They pounced on me ... and I got the chance, she pulled my zipper down and pulled it out.
Damn jerk who you are, Stephen.
And off we went!
So, for the record, you are no longer the virgin who we thought?
What? I am a virgin? I've just done on the backseat of Georgian Dragon, thank you.
Okay, I understand now, you have the barmaid of
Georgian Dragon a given turn.
Gary has pinned the blonde barmaid with
Lancelot are small.
Fuck you, sarcastic jerk.
It is not a dirty second hand.
Whatever.
Excuse me, I need the toilet.
- I told you, whatever.
You're an asshole Gary.
Wait.
Here we go. The girls here a reunion.
Can I include?
What? Can not I just pee quietly.
I just wanted to see if you're OK
- It's fine.
And, how are you? I think there new developments have.
Why you're here.
- Come on, how long you're with Stephen.
A couple of weeks if you want to know,
And before you start ...
We have one life, looks good, has brains, he knows what he is doing down there ... and he responds to my calls. Pretty important, Sarah.
Sorry, but I'm so busy at my live there to build.
I got you an e-mail.
- Yes, Stephen said you came home, so I thought you up with everything.
Would you stop now, because you know I do not may cry when someone else has problems.
Yes, you've always been a stranger.
And you're always been a cow.
It is crazy what your phone did, man.
It just did not matter when he fell.
You're completely mad, man.
Please look through the joint.
I see the questioning of my girlfriend went well.
So I think it's your turn.
- What, Stephen?
To make your sexual experiences.
That should shed some light how you ended with those crappy job in the U.S., eh, Half Witt.
No thanks, Half Witt.
You know Sarah, the last 8 months have you done a great job with your radio silence.
With all the arguments of separation, and so on and so forth.
That's not fair, I've worked hard.
- And even harder to hide.
If one is hiding, it is you Stephen.
And, when will you find a job. Or is it nice and cozy here.
King of your castle
- That's enough, both.
Why has no one else told what is going on?
This is not the time nor the place. Daddy ...
Stepfather and for that matter, thinking that mom one ratio.
And they paid huge sums loverboys.
Do you imagine that what they money to do.
I wonder what she really is tonight
- Nonsense ... there must be another explanation.
Yes, of course, as you head in the sand stabbing.
Well done imp.
Storm, rain and our empty house equals power failure, as usual, right?
Okay?
Yeah, okay.
We have you in mind, we have more beer and cigarettes.
I organize a raid party.
You end up at the drink in my bed, because this is after all an emergency.
You can get the candles out of the pantry, that you should be fine.
And you?
- Who has given you in charge?
Well, you go and Luke out of bed.
No, let him sleep.
- Sorry, I'm trying to help him.
But what I told Charlie, you can secret
Cigarette stock clearance,
If I sacrifice my drink.
- How do you know?
Because I'm your big brother. It is my job to know.
You're his little brother from what I saw.
And you use your imagination ... when we reach the top.
And what about the replacement fuse?
I ask Dad before I go go this beautiful woman.
He's asleep.
And why should I care?
- We have the flashlight.
Follow me.
- Beware.
Point the way but you.
What a legacy your father left behind in our mother when he died years ago.
It's more 'than one financial disaster' s pocket.
I do get those candles.
Take it easy, baby.
- I'll go, I'll go.
I have a fire. I'm an alpha male.
- Loser.
Okay, see you later.
I would dare best bet.
Fooled!
You should not make jokes, Gary.
You know what to do.
And you, you stay with me.
What is that?
This place gives you shivers, does not it?
Stephen?
Stephen?
It is your father's room!
Dad is awake.
No!
Father.
I do not want anymore, let's go.
Damn.
What the hell happened here.
Stoner?
Emily?
Stoner?
Emily come here!
Close the door!
What's going on?
Stoner is dead, man.
- Gary, run!
What are you fucking doing.
- Climb.
What's going on? Stephen, you dirty bastard.
So, what now?
Help me!
The door will not hold.
What is that down there?
- Do not leave me behind.
Hurry up, guys.
- Hurry up.
It moves down there, come on.
Go, go!
Come on.
Silence.
What did I do?
We need help.
- How do you think we manage that.
Do not talk so loud, Stephen.
Does anyone have a cell phone?
Mine is below in my bag, down at the piano.
Where is yours, Stephen?
Oh, no, no!
Emily?
- No.
Doug?
- Burn in the pub, remember.
Well, I'm not.
Does anyone have a pigeon?
No, we stay here and wait for help.
- Wait, Stephen, what about the gun?
I have not closed the cabinet
After the shooting last week.
Honey, I do nothing better than that fucking thing by shooting his head, but to get the gun, you have to past it.
Are there any volunteers?
Listen, we stay here and wait for help, okay?
I can not.
- And why can not Sarah?
Luke ... he may wake up.
Unless Mom gets home?
- I doubt it.
Sorry Stephen, but you have no idea when this will be.
Did you get that damn thing not you?
- What's it really.
What was that?
- A wild dog? Who knows.
Come on, you saw his height and his strength.
No dog with rabies can get something like that.
Except maybe the two dogs response to rabies, Stephen.
Maybe it's the same as drug addicts who become psychotic.
Maybe it is the same as animals with rabies.
Maybe his brain is stamped and is now bleeding to death.
Go check it, Doug, and finish as my father.
There's a phone in mom ...
Dad and his room. When we were there may come. - Halfling, Please stop.
Luke is so stoned that he continues to sleep.
- It's secure.
Dare to bet your life on, Stephen?
In order for the phone to go is a good idea.
- Beth, guys.
Look!
Where will it go?
This may be a way out.
I should do.
You know, right?
You're right. I know.
- Come on.
I am stronger, faster.
- Why you need to allow the other side.
And, you're right, you are stronger!
I can not see him as Charlie.
Soldier should, and replaces the lady, if necessary.
We can not ask of you, soldier.
We need your strength.
Keep an eye on my sister.
And keep your hands off.
And if you hear Charlie, do not back to me, and make that call.
Sarah ... good luck.
This is a damn bad idea you know, right?
Do you have a better idea then, Stephen?
Charlie Now! Now!
Help me with this.
- No Charlie, do not.
Do not do it Charlie!
- There is no other way.
Jump.
Hurry up!
 It comes to me. </ i>
It seems to me, you asshole!
Simone.
Wait, it stopped.
Please
Let go.
- What are you doing?
Let go!
 with the police. </ i>
There is a kind wild animal in our house.
 sorry sir, I can not well understood. </ i>
It has killed our father.
Charlie!
Charlie!
Speak clearly what  please. </ i>
- Wait a minute.
Charlie!
Doug!
- Get down!
Keep your head!
The storm is over, dogs and bitches.
There is nothing wrong.
Asshole!
Good evening, officer.
A little lost?
No, McGrey. I want you up and stuff come with me.
Need a reason to drag me into a
Piss night like this?
We've got a bell on unleashed animals, it will be invented.
Than the normal amount, times half.
That's between you and accounting.
Just grab your stuff, let's go.
Hey, not in here.
Sorry, Officer May.
You're lucky ... I have pay for it.
I told you it was a bad idea.
God knows why Charley to you listen.
Stephen, shut up. He would hear us.
- I guess he now knows.
I can not remember so that you was influenced.
That happened to you when you go to America?
Dying all rational thoughts it off?
And who was it who was not screaming? Who was next before, Stephen?
You are not the king of your castle.
You're just a village idiot.
Fuck you, sister!
Fuck!
You can not blame me.
- Stop it, this will not help.
Okay, sorry Doug. You know what ...
Emily and I leave it up to my half sister her panties sniffing.
Let me tell you something ... you are such an asshole.
Does anyone know if Charlie the phone has managed to achieve? Did he call?
How can we doubt?
- I think I heard him whisper.
Yes, begging for his life.
What are you doing? Where you going?
- I'm not staying here with these two losers.
And Doug, to enjoy delving into the family gene pool.
Stephen ...
- If you have not already.
Stephen, do not!
Sarah, I'm sorry.
Stephen, wait!
He is wrong.
It does not matter ... maybe he's not wrong, and is it to the genes.
He is wrong.
Stephen, I think this is nothing.
- Hurry simply.
Stephen ... what are these?
- They are not mine. They are of Charlie.
Stephen wait!
That thing must be so hard?
Do we really need those sirens?
It is not really determined rush hour, either?
You know that expression:
"Wasted police time?"
See anything?
- No, nothing.
Let me.
Careful.
Stay on the massive wooden joists.
Thanks. How are you with your ankle?
I survive it.
Stay tuned.
Nothing on this side.
Where is the hell.
You left me bad scare.
- Sorry.
You okay?
What are you doing?
Looking for trouble.
So, you've seen the light, and you asked you wonder what you had with my brother?
He is under a lot of tension. He doing his best.
We are all under pressure here, Emily.
Stress affects your loyalty to, say.
- Loyalty ...
Have you any idea how life is here without my best friend?
Calm again, Emily.
I have nothing due to my mom's PR contacts.
I sit here by myself. Stephen gives me at least one reason to get out of bed.
You mean in bed.
Oh, come on.
- Fuck you with my brother to get back to me?
What are you saying?
Do you know anything of self-respect that slutty person that you've made?
Sarah, you should hasten stop it, okay?
Defend your tweedehandsjes?
Maybe you and Stephen seem to be more alike than you'd like to admit.
Stephen and I have decided to for the gun to go.
How?
That's fucking stupid.
- I 've had to explain myself to you.
If there is a way, I feel sure safer with a shotgun and between us.
Until later. I agree with the rest. I'll be back.
Is there any kind of warranty with?
Do not worry. I come with a lifetime warranty.
Hold it down again.
How do they get it done.
Stephen, I'm stuck.
I can not.
Are these really Charlie?
I'm sorry, I did not want about him. Okay?
Look at me.
It'll be okay.
With all of you.
Stephen, do not.
Stephen, Stop it.
Stop it, Stephen!
Guys, something is moving down there.
Come on Stephen, come on.
Come on, Stephen.
Stop with that.
Get out of there.
- What's in there?
Guys, get out!
It can help us wall block. Help me, Stephen.
Do it damn it, Stephen.
This does not happen.
Stephen, help me.
Help me against it in the closet pushing.
Is it loaded?
Stephen, is it loaded?
I do not know ...
Over there, hold it down again.
Damn you, Stephen.
Stephen ...
Stephen?
Oh, my God!
It's in the room ...
It's in the room.
It's in the room. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.
Emily, we have here.
- Yes.
Where's Stephen?
Where is he?
Emily, you're okay.
- You dirty bastard.
I had to, otherwise we caught. I have the gun, look!
You set me run. You lied to me.
Keep this up.
Stop it! Keep your head down.
Is anyone hurt?
- We are fine.
You know why? Because those fool here ... taught me to take a hunting rifle to go.
You know what your problem is, Stephen?
No?
I thought so .. It surprises me nothing.
Stay there, Doug. I have shotgun here, remember?
Emily ...
- Defend your brother!
He deserves your help.
You, you walk with your nose in the air thinking you hold everyone, including me.
And then I thought ... why you suddenly
I became interested two months back?
Did you think Sarah would come home?
Did you think I am with her head went to play around?
Maybe I just fucking with you to its return address.
You'd never admit it, do you?
And you know why?
Because you're a maggot-free backpack, Stephen.
Asshole.
Fuck with me.
- So now let me see what I'm capable of.
I go through that door, and I take this rifle.
I'll look for that thing ...
And then blow his head off!
Have you ever heard the expression
"Driver change?"
I press against it.
That makes the blood curdle.
Thanks. How's your ankle?
It's not as bad as that
I thought.
It's okay, Stephen.
Let me have a look.
Let me now take a look!
Emily, where are you?
- I do not have it.
She said ...
- Does it really matter?
My best friend is dead.
My stepfather is dead.
One of my brothers are dead.
And you, you do not have them slain.
Do you understand?
It was ... being.
What is that thing down there?
Like I said ...
Does it even matter?
Doug!
I saw the gun does not.
What do we do now?
We have to leave.
- How?
We have nowhere else to go ... except upwards.
4x4 driven vehicles are worthless.
Well?
The car will not start anymore.
No power, no fuel.
He seems to stand for a while.
- Look at this post.
Look at the name and address on the license.
- Is this ...?
Indeed.
Where did she go?
See anything?
No, the coast is clear.
What will we do if
We can come off the roof?
Can we get the jeep going?
I must look into it, there's a rental car.
- It was locked. The key is in my bag.
Doug, you can open it.
I love how you think about me, Stephen.
- Can you or not?
An old Escort or I get up and running, but not so modern in those days.
Tide and we did not, so but let us worry about that later.
What a plan.
Well, it's a plan.
Her car broke down.
She is going to help search.
Case closed.
You go look.
That suits you.
You need to rest.
- I'm almost through.
I see or hear nothing.
That you should not do.
You could best help, right?
- Two words for this, satellite navigation.
She leave her handbag.
- What?
She leave her handbag.
What surprises me: she never leaves her purse behind.
Really?
- Maybe she was not bad luck ... maybe she went to investigate, and maybe she did not come back because ...
This is not a joke?
Boys!
We're almost there.
- Yes.
Okay, this road is another kilometer.
Hello?
Guys?
It's over.
Henry?
I'm here.
Father?
- Luke?
Be quiet.
Run, Luke, run.
- Do what your sister says, you hear me!
Exit the house, now!
- Father?
Not again.
Sarah?
Sarah!
Run!
We're out of here ... now!
Run.
- Running, running.
Come on.
- Hurry up.
Pull over.
Hurry.
- I have to shoot, move.
Come on!
- Come on, hurry up!
Go!
Where is it?
Yet a few hundred meters, it will be behind the trees.
It was time.
When we get there, give me time to my pack up.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Where is dad?
Where's Charlie?
He did not make it, sorry.
We can not stay here.
- Do you know something better?
Look!
There's someone through it.
Let's go.
Pack your stuff.
- Wait a minute, I told you I ...
Come on. Come on.
I shoot the bastard down.
I can certainly wait.
Damn!
- Help him, Stephen.
Can he run.
- As if he has a choice.
What the hell?
Wait. Wait.
- Silence.
They're dead.
- What? They're dead.
Are we in trouble?
- We can go the goddamn police car!
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Come on ...
Come on.
Damn.
What is she doing?
- What is she doing?
Anybody out there?
Hello?
Go on. Go on.
Let's go.
- Come on!
How is that?
Stephen, can you fix it?
Stephen?
Need help?
- Why do not Thurs, Douglas.
Doug, do you take me to the bathroom?
Honey, go along with Doug.
You can hide and be still.
Luke, I bet Stephen de jeep the talk and then we get away.
Come on.
- Take care.
Go ahead.
It's good, I promise.
Please say it to you can get underway, Stephen.
I think you, me and Luke are the only survivors of this family.
You should look at this.
Did you hear me, Stephen?
He can not be gotten under way be.
How can you be so sure?
Because the part we need
Mom sits in the boot of her cunt.
I reached her flat tire, dirty slut.
What did you say?
I reached her flat tire before in went into the cafe.
I tried to avoid that she would meet her lover.
Stupid bitch.
I can not be there to see her.
Luke said she was standing in the pouring rain, desperately trying to change her tire.
Dad did not help her, and it took her almost one hour.
Is not that funny?
This is a police car, Stephen.
If your hair had not delay ... she was probably with her lover having sex.
Do you understand that, Stephen?
Our mother is probably dead.
And if she is ... is your fault.
You can not buck on me.
If it is not that guy from Sussex went into the bed is ... that take your damn back!
It's not my fault she's dead!
You take that back!
- No.
You take the fuck back!
You've broken my nose.
What the hell happened?
What was that?
Where's Stephen?
He's gone.
What?
- He hit by ... and I could not stop him.
He was terrified.
I think I got him injured, but ...
I remember nothing after he hit me.
- He has beaten you?
It's too late.
And the jeep will not start.
My family is ...
Jesus, you totally glowing.
You must promise me that for Luke
I'll make it if something happened.
I promise.
He is now okay.
He's asleep now.
Jesus!
It's okay. He sleeps like a rose. We need a plan.
Not here. Not now.
You said that even in that room.
Olivia, stop it!
What's going on?
- Nothing Luke, we think the next step.
Sarah, what is it?
Sarah?
Doug!
Doug!
It's Sarah!
Get out. Get out!
Get out of here with me!
Where's Stephen?
- Sarah!
You said you would leave me alone, Sarah!
Where can we hide?
Big mistake, big mistake.
Why is there so much unnecessary mess here?
Come on, come on.
 Hello, hello, sir?
Sir, hello. </ I>
Sarah?
Sarah!
Move on!
Help me.
Help me!
Please!
Close the door.
Go into the car and shut the door locked.
Listen, please listen to me.
Luke I can out of here,
I swear, I can remove Luke here.
Luke, Luke I can out of here,
I swear to God.
No!
Luke?
Luke?
Luke!
Luke?
Please, open the door, Luke.
We go where mom last  night went. </ i>
Somewhere where they no  hurt when she ...</ i>
 changed .... </ i>
 Somewhere where it's safe. </ i>
Mr. Faulk? James Sandin.
Hey, Mr. Sandin.
I talked to John over at repairs, and he took care of it.
It's all fine.
The system is working without a hitch.
You are going to be locked in tight tonight.
Thank you, sir.
All right, Mr. Faulk.
Safe night.
James Sandin's office.
Sue? Yeah,
I took care of Faulk.
What do you know, did you hear anything?
You're number one,
Mr. Sandin.
All right. Yeah.
You got it, sir. You came out on top.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Congratulations to you, too, Susan.
You don't have to say that.
No, Susan, it's a team win.
Thank you.
Okay. All right, well, safe night.
Safe night, Mr. Sandin.
The poor can't afford to protect themselves.
They're the victims tonight.
We all got our own opinions.
That's what makes this country great.
Holly, line four.
What are your Purge plans?
Locking down behind my brand new security system.
Pete from Northern Virginia, what's your Purge plan?
I'm gonna hunt down my boss.
That son of a bitch has it coming.
Clearly, more people will be Purging this year than ever before.
American streets will be running red tonight,
when people release the beast in record numbers.
Mr. Cali! You're getting one last walk in before lockdown, huh?
Yep.
Did you do the systems check I recommended?
Of course.
No problems.
Yeah, it's the same one I use.
I only sell the best.
Nobody's bothering us tonight.
You have a safe night, Mr. Sandin.
Thanks.
Don't forget to buy your blue Baptisias.
Display those flowers proudly, folks, okay?
Show your support for this important evening.
Safe night to everyone.
Home again, home again.
Jiggity-jig.
Release the beast, and Purge in our American streets.
Your New Founding Fathers...
Hey, honey, I'm home!
I'm in the kitchen.
What a day, what a day.
Everybody's doing security checks, it's crazy.
Traffic's even worse than last year.
Something smells good.
Hey.
Ta-da!
Ah.
I'll put them in water, get them outside.
Okay.
Where are the kids?
Their rooms, of course.
We got an hour before commencement, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Dinner's nearly ready, so, uh, hurry up.
All right.
Well, I have to make a few phone calls.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh.
One thing?
Yeah?
Zoey is getting worse.
She's been pouting all day.
I can't stand it.
So, you're gonna have to do something about the Henry situation.
There's nothing to do about it.
He's 18, he's not getting any younger.
She's just gonna have to sulk.
She'll get over it.
But I've got some good news for all of us.
I'll tell you at dinner.
History has proven this over and over again.
We are inherently a violent species.
Wars, genocide, murder.
The denial of our true selves is the problem.
The Purge not only contains societal violence to a single evening,
but the country-wide catharsis creates psychological stability
by letting us release the aggression we all have inside of us.
I love you.
Let's growl.
What?
Growl.
Why?
Because everyone says,
"I love you."
It's used, and we need to find our own thing.
Oh.
Go like this...
No, I'll look silly.
Come on.
No.
Do it. It's our way of saying,
"I love you." Try it.
Do it.
I think my dad's home.
I'm sorry, baby. You've got to get going.
I'm sorry.
And you have to get home before lockdown.
Come on.
Come here.
Someone's getting ready for tonight.
Be careful.
Mary!
I'm so glad I caught you.
I come bearing gifts.
What have I done to deserve a gift, Grace?
Oh, I have a new hobby.
Baking. Grace. Mary.
I made way too many cookies.
Hi!
Ooh! Cookies!
I hope you're hungry.
Those cookies are crazy good.
They're lovely.
Have a safe night, ladies.
Bye!
Good night!
Bye!
Thank you, Grace.
Yeah, just what the Halversons needed.
More cookies, right?
Oh!
The new addition you built, it's just amazing.
Thank you.
Not everyone had the year you did, Mary.
What do you mean?
You know your husband sold a new security system to almost every home in this community.
You know, some people are actually saying this neighborhood paid for that new addition on your home.
Are people really saying that?
Relax, it's just good old neighborhood gossip.
Nothing to worry about.
You're too sensitive.
So, are you having your annual party, Grace?
No. Too much trouble.
We're just gonna lock down, watch some Purge events.
Nothing special.
Well, um, thank you for the cookies.
Good night.
You're welcome.
Have a safe night, Mary.
And you, Grace.
Christ.
You scared me to death.
You can't keep creeping up on me like that, Charlie.
So, quit playing with Timmy and come help me set the table, kiddo. Okay?
Now.
Christ! Charlie, that's twice today.
You're gonna give me a heart attack.
Sorry, Mom.
Look, check it out. I made some adjustments to Timmy.
I installed a night vision program and I insulated his motor, so you can barely hear him.
And he can now play music to accompany him on his missions.
See?
He likes songs from olden times.
Mmm-hmm.
That is very, very cool.
What is it?
What's bothering you?
It's tonight, isn't it?
Just remember all the good the Purge does, okay?
It's all that matters.
Are you hungry?
A little bit.
Good.
Well, take Timmy away and come back and help me finish up, okay?
Mmm. Okay.
Honey, this food is so good.
Isn't it amazing?
Not one carb.
Oh, great.
Not one.
Well, I'd like to hear about everybody's day.
Zoey, you want to go first?
Charlie, what are you doing?
Sorry, I forgot to take my vitals earlier.
Honey...
By the way, there's a slight deviation in my heart rate, but other than that, nothing to worry about.
Okay, thank you.
Zoey, your day.
I don't want to do this anymore.
It's stupid.
Okay, fine.
Calc test, piano. Normal day.
Mmm-hmm.
Who cares?
I do.
I care, very much.
And what about practice?
You ready for your recital?
James.
Of course you are, because you're always ready.
Just make sure your left hand cooperates in that third movement.
When I'm listening, that's what I hear.
All right, can I...
Does anybody mind?
Can I do my day?
- I have some news. Um...
- Go ahead.
I did it. I did it.
All sales are final...
And I'm on top.
My division sold the most upgraded security systems.
Congratulations, Dad.
Thank you.
Congratulations, baby.
Thanks. It's a team effort, you know?
All right, Charlie, you're next.
Well, we studied the history of tonight in History.
And in English, I wrote a story about a man whose love is so powerful, that it can kill people.
So, he cuts out his own heart.
That is so sweet.
You know, he should have cut off his own penis.
Zoey, Zoey...
Eating dinner, no penises!
Charlie, don't encourage her.
Don't fist-bump that!
We're not in the dormitorium, okay?
"Dormitorium?"
Is that even a word?
Get with the times.
God.
Guys, look what time it is.
Oh, wow, it's later than I thought.
All right, it's time for lockdown. Let's go.
Don't even think about it.
Hey, give that back.
Are we in the zoo?
Fine, I want this.
Hey, look at this.
Mr. Sabian and Mr. Barbero are going hunting.
That's daring.
I didn't know they were going to Purge together.
Are they friends?
Hmm. The Ferrins are having a party.
Grace said she wasn't having a party this year.
Just thank God we weren't invited.
She's nice. But, wow, she's annoying.
All right, let's get ready for tonight.
As always, just a precaution.
All right, Mr. Cali is starting his lockdown.
Okay.
Are we ready?
All right, let's hit it.
Okay, Charlie, it's almost time. Hit it.
Release the beast and Purge in our American streets.
Your New Founding Fathers encourage your participation.
This is not a test.
This is your
Emergency Broadcast System
announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge
sanctioned by the U.S. Government.
Weapons of Class Four and lower
have been authorized for use during the Purge.
All other weapons are restricted.
Government officials of ranking 10
have been granted immunity from the Purge
and shall not be harmed.
Commencing at the siren,
any and all crime, including murder,
will be legal for
12 continuous hours.
Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable
until tomorrow morning at 7:00
AM when the Purge concludes.
Blessed be our
New Founding Fathers
and America, a nation reborn.
May God be with you all.
Okay, kids. I know bad things do happen tonight.
But we can afford protection.
So, we'll be fine, just like always.
No worries.
Okay? Okay?
Can I go now?
I would prefer to be miserable in my room.
Of course you may.
Thank you for being here.
Where are you going, bud?
Hey. Charlie.
Why don't you guys do it?
Because we don't feel the need to, Charlie. That's all.
So, if you felt the need to, you would kill someone tonight?
Look, I know this is difficult to understand at your age, but tonight allows people a release for all the hatred and violence and aggression that they keep up inside them.
Okay? And yes, if your mother and I were so inclined, uh, we would participate.
Because it works.
You don't remember how bad it was, Charlie.
The poverty, all the crime.
This night saved our country.
Hey...
Why don't you go relax?
We're all done here.
I've got some paperwork to process to get my bonus.
Then we should watch a movie later with the kids.
Jesus, Henry!
You scared the hell out of me.
Wait, what are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
So, I snuck in when you were eating.
Baby, you can't be in here.
My dad will lose his mind if he sees you here now.
Come on.
Aren't you happy to see me?
Of course.
We're looking at some live feeds from around the country
and discussing the Purge with criminologist Tommy Aagaard.
Thanks, Nicole.
Now, is the Purge really about releasing aggression
and containing violence,
or is it something else?
Purge detractors often postulate
this evening is actually about the elimination of the poor,
the needy, the sick.
Those unable to defend themselves.
The eradication of the so-called
"non-contributing members" of society,
ultimately unburdening the economy.
Is the Purge really about money?
Either way, crime is down.
The economy is flourishing.
I can't do this.
Um...
Did I do something?
No. I... Um...
I just...
I didn't come here to see you.
I came to see your father.
What? Why?
It's time to straighten this out.
He cannot forbid you from seeing me.
That's crazy.
It might be crazy, but he's not going to change his mind.
He thinks you're too old for me.
Talking to him is only going to make him more angry and he'll make it more difficult for us.
I promise everything is gonna be okay.
America was collapsing.
A quadruple dip recession followed by a full market crash.
A skyrocketing debt, multiple wars
and a significant dollar devaluation...
All precipitating the worst economic disaster
in the history of the United States.
Crime and poverty rose exponentially,
and the New Founding Fathers, just months after being elected
came up with this audacious notion,
the decriminalization of murder for one night.
A lawful outlet for American rage.
A way to contain crime.
The undeniable fact is, this is working.
I thought I heard gunshots.
A couple of streets back, maybe?
Gunshots are gonna happen tonight, okay?
It's nothing.
It's probably somebody just firing off a few rounds before going hunting.
Come on.
Let's go relax.
Hold on.
Look.
He can't kick me out.
He's gonna be forced to listen to what I have to say.
I don't know.
One on one.
Man to man, no BS.
I'm gonna explain to him that sure, I may be older, but you're also very mature.
So age difference is not a problem.
I'll tell him how much I love you.
10 years ago, we could barely afford rent.
Now we're thinking about buying a boat.
Crazy.
Yeah... Uh-oh.
This one has a car garage.
Who needs a car on a boat?
They're coming after me.
They're gonna kill me!
Can anyone hear me?
Help me!
Someone, please, help me!
They're coming after me, all right?
Can anybody help me?
Please. They killed...
I just need to get somewhere safe.
Does anybody hear me?
Look, I won't hurt you!
I don't want to die.
I don't deserve this.
Why won't anybody help me?
I just need somewhere to hide.
Somebody, please, just open the door for me.
They're coming, they're coming.
Somebody, please!
They're gonna kill me!
What the hell?
Come here!
Let's go!
This way!
Come on!
Hurry!
Come on! Hurry!
What the hell?
Charlie! Zoey!
This way! Hurry!
Go! Go!
Hurry!
What the hell is going on?
Mr. Sandin.
James, he has a gun!
Henry has a gun!
Oh, my God!
Henry!
Henry! Henry!
Oh, God!
James. Are you hit?
I didn't hit Zoey, did I?
I think she's okay.
Zoey! Zoey!
Charlie, come here.
Mom, what's going on?
Charlie, where is he, huh?
Where's the man?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
Who is he? Why did you let him in our home?
He was hurt. He called for help.
No one was helping him.
Charlie, Jesus Christ.
What the hell? Huh?
We have no idea what this man is capable of.
Enough.
Enough, James.
He's gone. We don't know what Henry might do.
And we're not safe out here.
We don't know where Zoey is.
You're right.
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
Henry! Henry.
Hang on.
Henry!
Come on.
Henry?
Okay.
Here's the plan.
You two stay put here, and I'll just...
I'll go out there and I'm gonna find Zoey and I'm gonna bring her back here.
Henry tried to kill you.
James...
I know. Mary, I got to make sure she's okay.
Okay? I have to.
He didn't shoot at me.
I'll find her,
I can go. I'll be fine.
No, no, no...
I can't let you go with that man out there.
Okay?
I can't let you do that.
Baby, I...
Let me go get her.
You just stay here with Charlie. Okay?
You be careful, okay?
I will.
Zoey? Zoey?
Zoey? It's me.
You okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, Mom.
Okay.
Mom?
Mom?
Charlie? Mom?
Charlie, you wait here. I'm gonna be right outside the door.
Okay.
Zoey.
Zoey?
Mom?
Zoey, sweetheart.
Are you okay?
Is Charlie okay?
Where's Dad? Is he all right?
Everyone's fine.
Morn, I didn't know Henry was going to do that.
I didn't know he was going to...
Why would he do that?
Mom? Charlie, just give me a second, okay?
Mom, he died.
Keep the door closed.
- He's dead. Henry's dead.
- Mom?
Mom!
Charlie, just give me a second.
Zoey, let's see what Charlie wants.
Mom, now!
What is it, baby?
You need to see this.
Tell Dad I'm sorry.
Zoey, please!
Zoey!
Zoey?
Zoey.
Hey,
Mr. Sandin, are you home?
Wait, James,
I have to talk to you.
Henry is dead.
I killed him.
I know. I saw Zoey.
Is she okay? Is she hurt?
Is she in there?
She's not hurt.
I couldn't get her to come with me.
What are we gonna do?
I have to show you something.
Oh, God, I know.
That one is saying something.
...and Mrs. Sandin.
Your home tells me you're good folk, just like us.
One of the "haves."
And your blue flowers tell me that you support the Purge.
We want to treat you fairly, so listen closely.
Let me introduce us.
We are some fine, young, very educated guys and gals.
We have gotten gussied up in our most terrifying guises,
as we do every year,
ready to violate, annihilate, and cleanse our souls.
But things took a turn.
Our target escaped us, and...
Several of your dear neighbors informed us that you, the Sandins,
have inexplicably given him sanctuary.
Mr. and Mrs., the man you're sheltering is nothing
but a dirty, homeless pig.
A grotesque menace to our just society,
who had the audacity to fight back,
killing one of us when we attempted to execute him tonight.
The pig doesn't know his place,
and now he needs to be taught a lesson.
You need to return him to us.
Alive.
So that we may Purge as we are entitled.
Here's the plan, Sandins.
You have until our provisions arrive,
provisions which will help us break into your elegant home.
If you don't...
If you don't deliver him by the aforementioned time,
we'll release the beast on him...
And on you.
And, um, we can enter any home we want.
And we will want as wanting is our will on this fine night.
Don't force us to hurt you.
We don't want to kill our own.
Please, just let us Purge.
Toodle-oo, Sandins.
Cut it. Cut it now.
The monitors are working on backup.
The power's out in the whole house.
James, they can't get in here, right?
They can't get into our home.
I don't know.
It's hard to say.
You don't know?
You sell these security systems.
What do you mean, you don't know?
We have tested the system. It works 99 percent of the time.
It looks good. It's strong.
People stay away.
It looks good?
It's not built for worst-case scenarios.
Is it impenetrable?
No, nothing's impenetrable.
Things like this are not supposed to happen in our neighborhood.
Well, they are happening, James.
They're happening right now.
Do you see this?
Okay, listen, just sit down.
Sit down, please.
We gotta calm down.
Sit down.
All right. Sit down, sit down.
Listen.
Okay, to answer your question, yes, they could get in here.
They could tunnel underneath us.
They could smoke us out.
They could devise a battering ram, okay?
I'm sorry, but it's true. So, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna give them what they want.
We're gonna find that man and we're gonna force him outside.
Now, we have guns, and he doesn't.
But they'll kill him.
Why should he die?
It's him or us, Charlie.
Why don't you give us the homeless man?
No one will miss him when he's gone.
Pretty please.
Wait a minute.
Shit.
Where is he?
There he is.
Look at me.
Come on, look over here.
Where are you?
Come on.
Dear Mr. Sandin!
Sorry to interrupt, but
I'd love to have a word.
Meet me by your front door. I just need a moment, good sir.
There you are.
Thank you for accepting my invitation.
Tell me, why haven't you delivered the filthy swine to me yet?
Are you protecting him?
I surely hope not,
Mr. Sandin.
No. Of course not.
We just can't find him.
You see, this is a misunderstanding.
My son let him in.
He's a young boy.
He doesn't know better.
But I support what occurs here tonight 100 percent, okay?
I sell security equipment.
So, I would never deny yours, or anybody else's right to Purge.
Just give us the homeless pig, you fuck!
Sorry about that.
I don't condone that kind of behavior.
But just keep in mind,
Mr. Sandin...
He was my friend, and you are not.
Our equipment is arriving soon.
And we will get in.
Send out he, or that...
Will be thee.
I'll go get him.
You should do that.
Hey, Charlie.
I don't know what's going on.
There are people outside.
Um...
And Henry's dead.
I'll be okay.
I have his gun.
Stay where you are.
Please be safe, okay?
I'm going to go hide in your secret spot.
No.
All right? I love you.
Don't.
Zoey.
Get back.
Into the hall.
Let's go.
Drop your gun.
Dad, please.
Drop it.
Don't hurt her.
Lower your weapon.
Zoey, I will not let him hurt you.
Leave her alone, you son of a bitch.
I will let her go when this night is over.
You're gonna get us all killed. You know that.
They're coming in here, and they are gonna kill us all.
They are gonna come in here, and they are... Back up.
You got to leave my family out of this. Okay?
If you don't drop your gun,
I will hurt her and I will hurt you.
We didn't do anything to you.
We don't deserve this. I don't deserve this either.
Now, listen, I don't want to hurt any of you, but I am not dying tonight!
Drop your gun.
Please.
Drop it.
Put the gun down.
Listen to me.
Okay.
You are going to die tonight.
And you can either die like a man, and walk outside there by yourself, or you can die like a coward and get my wife and my children killed along with you.
Okay? So take that gun away from my daughter's head!
Shoot him, Mary! Shoot him!
Get off me!
Stop!
Shit. Shit.
Mary? Mary!
Zoey!
She's unconscious. She hit her head.
Mary, are you okay?
We got to get some rope.
What?
Mary, we have to get some rope and we have to tie him up and get him outside.
And we're gonna end this goddamn night.
All right?
Do you hear me?
Okay. Okay.
All right. Come on,
Charlie, help me.
Sweetheart?
Sweetheart?
Okay, I'm almost done here. As soon as you get the legs secure...
You got it? All right, let me see.
Let me see. Good job.
You're doing great, honey.
Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna roll him into that chair, and we're gonna drag him outside and we're gonna be done, all right?
Mmm-hmm. You got it?
All right, we ready?
Charlie, just concentrate on your sister, okay?
See if she's waking up.
Except, Charlie,
I need the light.
Thank you, son. Okay.
Hey, good job.
You're doing great.
All right. Let me get the chair, here.
Okay, we are almost done.
I'm gonna pick him up on the count of three, all right?
You're gonna help me.
Keep the light on us, Charlie.
Ready? One, two...
Three!
Okay.
Great. Now, let's get the tape and tape him in there.
Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!
I've got him, I've got him.
I got him.
Okay. Okay, all right!
You got to calm down. He's gonna break this tape!
Press on his wound.
What?
Get the letter opener and press on his wound!
Get the letter opener on the desk!
Grab the letter opener!
No, Mom!
Listen to me. I am just trying to protect my family.
Just calm down.
Mom!
Come on, do it.
Do it, Mary!
Do it!
Press on his wound!
Yes!
Mom!
You want her to do it again?
Mom, stop!
Just do it again, Mary.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Ready to sit in the chair?
Yeah, he's ready.
Help me up. Help me up.
Ready? Okay.
Stay there, all right?
Stop it.
Just let me take you in this chair. All right?
Mary, where's the tape?
You are making this much more difficult than it needs to be.
You understand me? Huh?
Christ, look at us.
Look at this man.
Look at what we're doing to him.
Come on, Mary.
Let's get this over with.
Come on, Mary.
It's okay, Mary.
I can't.
Oh, yes, you can.
I need you right now, okay?
Hey, look at me. Huh?
Look at me, Mary.
Mary.
It's wrong. It's so wrong.
We don't have a choice.
This is so wrong.
We don't have any other choice.
Don't touch me.
Look at you.
No, no, no.
Don't touch me.
When did this happen?
James, look at you.
What the hell happened to us, James?
Charlie.
Charlie? Baby, where did you go?
Charlie?
Charlie!
Charlie, where are you, baby?
Charlie!
Zoey. Hey, are you all right?
Sit down, sit down.
You hit your head.
Are you okay?
Oh, God.
I am so sorry about Henry, okay?
I'm so sorry.
But we're gonna make it through tonight, all right?
We will, and everything is gonna be okay.
It's not gonna be okay.
What?
Look at what you're doing.
Nothing is ever going to be okay again.
Don't say that.
Save your children.
Take me outside.
Charlie? Charlie!
I want all these barricades down!
Get chains on every door and every window!
James, where's Zoey?
I don't know, she ran out here.
Those freaks outside are coming in!
They have chains on the doors and windows.
They're gonna pull them off and come inside.
Maybe you were right.
No, I wasn't right about anything.
You're not sending him outside?
I have another idea.
What are you gonna do?
Charlie!
Charlie, listen to me.
You take this gun.
Dad, are you sending him outside?
No. All right?
You're gonna go hide in the basement and you're not gonna come out for anybody, all right?
Okay.
You're a good boy.
All right, go, go.
You just gave our son a gun.
You want to tell me what the hell we're doing?
We're gonna fight.
I want you to take this one as well.
Safety's off.
You're gonna use a lot of rounds.
What do I do?
You're gonna cover the other side of the house.
This is our home.
Our kids live here.
Anybody tries to come in, you blast them.
You will not hesitate.
Mmm.
Dear Mr. and Mrs.!
I'm sorry to tell you this, but your time is essentially up.
And you failed!
You failed to deliver the homeless swine!
I'm very disappointed as you fine folk should know better!
That piece of filth that you are protecting exists only to serve our need to Purge!
So, I bid thee farewell, sweet Sandins.
Release the beast, boys.
Let the killing commence!
Run!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
No, I'm okay.
We've got to get out of here.
Come on, come on, come on.
Cooper, come look at little lady Sandin.
She's exquisite.
Save her for me.
Dad.
Are you okay?
Yes, Dad, I'm okay.
You stay here, okay?
Are Mommy and Zoey okay?
Yeah, they're gonna be fine.
Mmm...
Shit.
Shit!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Your soul has been cleansed, Mr. Sandin.
You've Purged.
Just one question for you.
Was his life really worth yours?
Your family's?
Thank you for this unforgettable
Purge, Mr. Sandin.
No! No! No!
Get off!
Get off of me!
James!
Let go of me!
Please, don't!
Please don't kill me.
Please don't!
James!
Please, don't!
Please, don't!
Please!
James!
James!
Please!
Please, don't!
Don't! Please don't!
James.
James.
Charlie! Charlie!
Zoey!
Dad!
Sorry.
Thank you for your sacrifice.
You got a lot of heart, Mr. Sandin.
Blessed be America...
A nation reborn.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
We saw that you were having some trouble.
We decided to help you.
You saved us.
I don't know what to say.
Don't thank us too much, Mary.
The truth is, you're ours, not theirs.
What do you mean "ours"?
What do you mean?
What do you mean "ours"?
Dad?
No, no, no!
Dad!
Wait! Wait!
Dad!
James is dead.
Mary and the kids will have to do.
Let's tie them up. We'll kill them right here.
No, no, no.
What do you mean?
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Come on.
No! No!
No!
No! No! No!
Mom! Mom!
Cali, get the tape!
Don't touch my fucking children!
Don't you touch my fucking kids!
Let them go!
Let them go!
Right now! You let my fucking kids go!
Shut up, Mary!
Shut up!
Right now!
Mary! Shut up!
I swear to God, I will shoot him right now.
Do you hear me?
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this right now?
When your barricades came down, we saw an opportunity to cleanse ourselves of our hatred.
You made so much money off of us and then you just stuck it in our faces.
You all think you're so damn perfect.
I just need you to listen to me, Grace.
I'm really begging you right now.
Do not do this to my children, please.
They're my children, please.
Please, not my children.
I can't let you do that.
We have to, Mary. That's what this night is all about.
I am begging you.
I'm really begging you.
I can't let you do this.
We'll be better people and you'll have sacrificed yourselves to make the world a better place.
Mom...
Mom!
You're frightening them.
Please don't.
Please let me hold my children.
Mary, no, no.
It's over.
Untie them.
It's over.
Please untie my hands.
Hmm?
Grace?
It's time for you to quiet down, Mary, and let us do our duty as Americans.
Mom.
Sweetheart...
Zoey, look at me, okay?
Just look at your mama.
Just look at me.
Just look at me.
Blessed be the New Founding Fathers for letting us Purge and cleanse our souls.
Blessed be America...
Blessed be America, a nation reborn.
I'll go first and then...
We'll take turns.
Timmy?
Don't move.
Drop your weapons right now.
Untie them, let's go.
Right now.
Your call.
Just get it over with.
Kill us quickly.
No.
Oh, for God's sake!
Just do it!
Come on!
Mom, they were going to kill us.
It doesn't matter.
We are gonna play the rest of this night out in motherfucking peace.
Does anyone have a problem with that?
Did you enjoy
Grace's Purge party...
Mr. Halverson?
Go fuck yourself.
Sorry, I can't hear you.
It was very nice.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you all had a grand time.
Didn't you hear what I said?
No more killing tonight!
Is it that hard to understand?
Oh, my...
Now get the hell out of my house.
Wait.
Are you going to be okay?
Thank you.
Good luck.
Just after 7:00 AM, March 22nd,
the Annual Purge has just concluded.
This is your American morning news program.
And reports are coming in from all around the country
as police, firefighters and paramedics...
The New Founding Fathers have released an early statement saying
this was the most successful Purge yet.
I am walking...
I should say "stumbling" through downtown Los Angeles,
and there are literally bodies everywhere.
I witnessed a group of young men
breaking into the tenement next to me,
and they were dragging people out
and just executing them on the street.
Hundreds have gathered in Times Square
for a public vigil
thanking all those who were killed last night
for their sacrifice to make this country a safer place.
They are turning people away
from emergency rooms in Brownsville
as there is simply no more room.
The markets were up this morning
as both gun and home security system
quarterly sales reports were released
announcing profits in both sectors.
We have 364 long days until the next Purge.
So let's get all our Purge talk and analysis in today
while our thoughts are still fresh.
From what I've been reading, it seems like Dallas had the most participants.
I did get a chance to see some live surveillance footage
out of Dallas, Forest Lawn,
and there had to be 200 people in the town square
Purging at the same time.
Never saw anything like this.
I lost my two sons last night.
My boys.
Yeah, I was a proud American.
Not anymore.
This country has taken everything from me.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
- Ian, please!
Could you just calm down?
- He did not know
I took the car.
He will be absolutely fucking furious.
- Your dad doesn't have to find out.
We can come back and get it tomorrow when we have the keys!
- Fuck!
Don't even think for half a second you're going to break open that car, mate.
So get out of my face.
What are you fucking looking at?
Stop looking at my girlfriend, midget!
- Ian, please!
- You want to fucky-fucky her?
No way in hell,
'cause let me tell you, there's only one guy who fucks her, and I fuck her real good, so go home and fuck mom now you demented dwarf!
No, please!
Please, no!
No, please!
Please, plea...
Don't!
Ian!
- Hey, I hope you're not time wasting, you.
I've got a dozen people waiting to look at this place, most of them paying cash as well.
You got cash?
Right, the light switch is somewhere here I think.
- Hey, come on, let's get this fucking lease signed, hey?
- Hi, this is Marc from USA Actors Management
regarding your audition request for our clients
Miss Williams and Mr. Kitamura
from Human Centipede.
Neither is available for the auditions in London right now
because they're shooting a movie,
but thank you for the interest.
Maybe we can do something in the future.
Good-bye.
- Stop them tears.
You're just making
Daddy's willy harder.
Oh, my God.
Have you shit yourself again?
You swine.
I've called Dr. Sebring, and he's waiting.
Get up!
Hello, Martin.
Mmm.
Martin... come and join us.
Well..
Martin, I have your Ventolin.
Martin, I'm here today because your mother is very worried about you.
- He keeps on talking about a centipede with 12 people.
What does that mean?
- Now, let's see.
A centipede can be considered a phallic symbol.
Centipedes are very aggressive creatures.
Their bite can be very painful.
Maybe he is connecting the pain that a centipede inflicts with the pain inflicted on him through years of psychological and sexual abuse by his father.
- I miss my husband.
And it's your fault that he's in prison!
- Sometimes people that are mentally challenged and have a history of sexual abuse... mutilate their own sexual organs.
I'm sorry.
I going to have to go.
There's nothing to worry about.
I'm sure it's just a passing phase.
Hmm?
Martin.
Ah.
You're a good boy.
Mrs. Lomax.
- I've decided to kill us both.
This music is driving me crazy!
I can't stand this any more!
He can't stand it any more!
Come on, tell him.
Be a man like your father.
- Stop fucking bothering me, you retard.
I play my fucking music as loud as I fucking want, okay?
- Kill us both.
I'm begging you.
- Shut your fucking mouth, you old cunt.
What the fuck?
- I will play my music so fucking loud, it's going to make your fucking ears bleed, you cock-sucking dwarf.
Next time, you batter that fucking ceiling,
I'm gonna come down and break your fucking neck,
Fuck!
Fucking little cocksucker.
Don't fucking bang that fucking ceiling any-fucking-more, okay?
You cock-sucking retard!
- The lips from B and C
and the anus of A and B are cut circular
along the border between skin and mucosa,
the mucus cutaneous zone...
the circular mucosa and skin parts
of anus and mouth from A to B and B to C.
Connecting the pedicellated grafts
to the chin-cheek incisions from A to B, connected...
Ingestion by A
passing through B
to the excretion of C.
A human centipede...
first sequence.
- Will you give me a high five when we get there?
- Hey.
- Shh, shh.
My lead.
My lead.
Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Ja, komm.
Yeah!
Yeah, coma up ham.
Come up, oh, yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah!
Very good!
Yeah!
I did if!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Why do these stupid things never work?
- Oh, Valerie!
It's that guy from the club!
- Shh!
There's...
Babe, there's a midget wanking in there.
- You are drunk, love.
- No, seriously!
- Hi, this is Arianne
from Creative Acting
Talent Management.
You called us with an audition request
for our client actress Miss Yennie from The Human Centipede.
I just spoke to Miss Yennie,
and she is very, very excited and available
to fly to London to audition for the new Tarantino film.
Could you please contact me
ASAP on my cell phone,
713-499-0913.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
- You can't do this.
It's a film.
The Human Centipede is a fucking film.
He is going to stitch us up.
He is going to stitch us up ass to mouth.
Help!
Help!
- Stop them tears.
You're just making
Daddy's willy harder.
- What is this?
100% medically accurate?
Mouth to anus?
One digestive system?
Is this a perverted film you've been talking about?
- I want all this filth out of my house!
- Fuck!
Doh!
Fuckin' hell!
Ahhhhh!
Gahhh!
Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
- Swallow it, bitch.
Swallow up.
- Feed her.
Feed her!
Ahhh!
- That was fucking sensational.
And you know what?
Your pussy smells gorgeous.
Yeah.
How you doing, doc?
Oh, I rather fuck that retarded boy, but... this'll do.
- I know a place in Thailand where they specialize in that sort of thing.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, she's a good one.
- How much to fuck you up the arse, darling?
- For you, darling, 50.
- Jesus.
Who the fuck are you?
What the fuck have you done to yourself?
That's right.
Have a good stare.
Have a good fucking stare, you little fucking pervert!
Fuck off now before I get out of this car and smash your fucking face in!
Don't!
- No, please.
Please!
- Martin?
Martin, it's me,
Dr. Sebring.
So... this is where you work.
This isn't right, Martin.
What you're doing, it's wrong.
Martin, I can help you, but you have to put the gun down.
Imagine what your father would say if..
Martin, Martin, no, Martin!
Please.
I'll do anything you want.
Please!
I won't tell...
I won't tell no one nothing.
You fucking...
Someone help me!
- Hi, Martin, this is Arianne,
Miss Yennie's manager.
I wanted to confirm that Miss Yennie is not delayed
and will be landing this morning
on London's Heathrow Airport at 6:00 a.m. your time.
I understand your driver will be picking her up.
I hope she does a great audition.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye!
- God, I cannot believe
I am here auditioning for a Quentin Tarantino film.
My agents are so excited about this.
I should probably call them, tell them I landed and, you know, I'm on my way.
- Have you seen
The Human Centipede?
- I was really drawn to the film because of the medical aspect of it.
If you were a surgeon, you could actually perform that surgery.
It's just so scary.
It was so grueling being on all fours, so I demanded in my contract that I had to have an hour... long massage every night.
I mean, why would I not demand that in my contract?
Oh, and the rest of the cast, we all took showers before we shot the centipede stuff, because I mean, you're close to someone's butt, and you don't want to smell anything and... or, you know, whatever.
I'm kind of a germaphobe.
Um...
Oh, that must be Quentin's car.
Do you have an umbrella?
Because this rain will ruin my hair.
Okay.
Oh!
- Please, please.
Please don't hurt me.
Please.
I'll do everything.
- Hello, this Marc from
USA Actors Management again.
Please disregard my earlier message.
Fortunately, Miss Williams and Mr. Kitamura
were able to reschedule,
and they're really, really excited to come to London
for Mr. Tarantino's auditions.
I hope it's still possible.
I'm totally confident
that they're gonna do very well on this,
so please call me back as soon as possible
at this number to confirm.
Thanks very, very much.
Talk to you soon.
Good-bye.
- Ah!
Hello, Mr. Hindle,
or as they called you around the hospital, Zepp.
Game over!
Check it, man.
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm fucking stuck.
Yeah, me too.
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.
Somebody, help us.
- Hello.
- Come on, help us!
Oh, my God!
Dina.
Brad.
- Ryan?
- Baby, are you okay?
- Get me out of here!
- Baby.
Help us. Somebody help us!
Hey! Call the police!
Hey, break the glass with your case.
Break the fucking glass! Do it.
Stay back!
Do it!
- Get me out of here.
- Break it!
Hello, Brad.
Hello, Ryan. I'd like to play a game.
The same woman has played each of you for a fool,
manipulating your love for her, and causing nothing but pain.
Her fun and games pushed you both to break the law to fulfill her material needs.
She is toxic,
and today all of your transgressions will be made public.
He's fucking lying, Brad.
Now you must choose who will drop out of this triangle,
for within 60 seconds one of you must die.
If you wish to save her, then the saws must be pushed
all the way to one side or the other,
sparing her while proving for good who is indeed the alpha male.
What are you fucking staring at, you motherfuckers?
- Do something!
- Are you both strong enough
to walk away from what is destroying you,
or will you fight one more time for the heart that binds?
You have 60 seconds to decide.
Live or die. Make your choice.
Oh, fuck!
One of you save me!
What the fuck are you doing?
It's me or you asshole, and it sure as shit isn't gonna be me.
Brad. Brad.
Brad, I love you.
I love you too, baby.
Do it. You gotta do it.
- What?
- You gotta kill him, Brad.
- Do it!
- Stupid bitch!
Do it. Do it! Do it!
Aw, Fuck!
You love him?
No, no.
You love him more than me?
No, I had to say that.
I've always loved you.
You got to do it for me, please.
You got to kill him. Kill Brad! Do it!
You lying slut!
What the fuck are you doing?
You don't love anybody!
You're a cheat and a liar. Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Brad! Brad, look at me!
Is the chick that fucked me in your bed two days ago worth one of our lives?
She's not worth it, man. She's not worth it.
Right?
Yeah!
What are you doing, you fucking asshole?
I think we're breaking up with you, Dina.
No! No, stop!
- Stand aside!
- Move it!
People, get out of the way.
Somebody help her.
Game over.
No! No, you fucking bitch!
No!
Tonight, a house of horrors has been discovered
at what used to be known as the Rowan Zoological Institute.
The body of Umbrella Health CEO
William Easton has been identified
as one of the several victims of this grizzly crime scene.
However, we have also been informed that there may be
as many as seven survivors from this deadly event.
Hopefully the many questions of the local police,
the FBI, and the victims' family members may be answered
by those seven civilians lucky enough
to walk away from this unprecedented display
of carnage with their lives.
We now go live to Tony Gabrielson who is reporting from the scene. Tony.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, what's up?
- What have we got here?
- That's Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's widow.
What does she want?
All she said was that she didn't trust the FBI,
- and she didn't trust homicide.
- Good.
And she just wants to talk to you.
- Why me?
- I don't know. Only you, though.
Jeez, she looks crazier than a sack full of cats.
All right, let's get this over with.
Hey. I put cream and sugar in it.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs.
My colleague said that you wanted to speak with me.
Yes.
But I need complete immunity.
Why do you want immunity, Miss Tuck?
Because of what I know.
Which is what?
Do we have a deal?
You've got to give before you can receive in this house, Jill.
My husband John, he had an accomplice.
A person who assisted him with almost every murder.
Look, don't get me wrong.
I'm all ears if you've got something legit that you want to put on the table.
This person will go on killing until he's stopped.
- You know him and he definitely knows you.
- Is that right?
He's detective Mark Hoffman.
Are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit?
Yes.
You swear to be totally open?
You tell me everything, no matter how personal or private?
Yes.
I'll give you evidence, whatever you want, as long as I have your protection, and complete immunity.
Do we have a deal?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.
Welcome back!
We're live with Bobby Dagen whose national tour
S.U.R.V.I.V.E.
My Story of Overcoming Jigsaw rolls into town this weekend.
Well, you're quite the national phenomenon these days, aren't you?
Well, thank you, ma'am.
It's quite flattering how many people have responded to my story.
And if I can help a few people along the way, then I'm pleased.
Now, you survived a trap created by the infamous Jigsaw killer, correct?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, everyone must ask you this question.
What was that like?
Life changing.
It was something I never anticipated and, quite honestly, something that should have killed me.
Tell me more.
Tell me about the actual experience.
I actually have no recollection of how I got there.
I just remember the feeling of waking up trapped.
And I had to insert two hooks into my pectoral muscles and hoist myself up to a platform.
You put the hooks in yourself?
I did.
I pretty much realized that I couldn't hold on much longer, and I had to accept the fact that I was going to die.
And then I saw something, and what I saw was my life.
It was a tragedy. I achieved nothing.
And right then, something inside me started to grow, something from the bottom of my soul.
And I just... I decided to live.
I found a strength that I thought had long since expired.
And I just yanked, and I yanked!
And when I got to the top,
I just ripped the hooks out of my chest.
There was blood everywhere, and I just screamed.
I just sat there and screamed.
Because I hadn't just survived,
I was reborn.
This was my life.
Wow. Bobby Dagen, everyone.
Bobby's life-changing experience comes to the...
This is the moment.
- Where's the big kiss?
- I don't know.
Tickets are still available.
And we're out, folks.
- That's not the way it's supposed to be.
- You need to relax.
No, we rehearsed it differently.
It's okay. Nice work, Bobby.
Ladies, can you excuse us for a minute?
Where was the big finish, Bobby?
You tell your story, you thank your pretty wife, you bring her out for a big hug and kiss.
I just didn't want to push it, all right?
Okay, but that's the heart of the story.
She was there for your whole recovery.
And without the acknowledgment, without the kiss, the audience isn't gonna have any kind of emotional connection.
I disagree.
Too much emotion, and it's gonna feel like pandering.
Okay, why don't you let me do the public relations, and you do the legal paperwork, okay?
Okay, I get it, Suzanne, all right?
It's my fault.
It wasn't your fault, Bobby.
You were fine.
- Just remember your bullet points next time.
- I will.
These interviews are important.
Nina, relax.
Don't worry about them.
You were great.
Yeah?
Your story's real and people feel that.
I know that you get overwhelmed at times, but we have to keep moving forward, Bobby.
You were meant to do this.
I know. I know, baby.
- Bobby.
- Yeah?
We got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow.
Thirty minutes of face time with other survivors.
Yeah, sounds good.
- Nothing more exciting than that.
- No, not much. Let's go.
Oh, God!
You want to know the only thing wrong with killing you, Jill?
I can only do it once.
Oh, my God!
No!
Help me! Help me!
Help! Fuck!
Hello, Evan.
I want to play a game.
The situation you find yourself in is of your own doing.
You, your girlfriend, and your friends are all racists.
Evan, you fuck. You get me out of here!
You have intimidated others based on their physical differences.
But today it is you who will run scared.
Your pathetic friends follow your every word, Evan.
Therefore you will be the only one capable of saving them and yourself.
In 30 seconds, the jacks holding up this car will fall,
setting off a deadly chain of events.
In order to stop this from happening,
you must tear yourself away from the seat to which you are glued.
Then you must pull the red lever before you.
But no act comes without a sacrifice.
You've judged others by the color of their skin,
and today, Evan, you will learn that we are all the same color on the inside.
Live or die, Evan, the choice is yours.
No!
- Evan, help!
- I can't.
- Do it. Fuck!
- Fucking do it!
Just fucking do it!
Do it! Do it, man!
Here I go!
Evan!
Baby, get me out of here!
Shit! Fuck! Here I go!
Here I go! Come on!
Fuck me!
Please!
- God!
- Do it! Fucking do it!
- God!
- Do it!
- Evan!
- You got us into this.
Get us the fuck out!
Do it!
You fucking pussy!
Shit.
Every night.
I keep thinking that things will get better the next morning when I wake up.
But it isn't.
Everything I do, everything I see, I'm surrounded by these tiny triggers.
They're everywhere, and they remind me of what I went through, what Jigsaw did to me.
Sidney, go on, please. You're...
You're in a safe place now.
Tell me what happened next.
Alex! Stop, please! Stop it!
Sidney, look at me.
You made a decision.
How did that make you feel?
Free.
He was abusive.
I tried to stop it before, but it wasn't until that moment that I really did something.
It was him or me, and I chose to live.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
That's a bunch of bullshit.
He had to die for you to leave him?
You want to know the best thing that happened to me after having to cut off my own arm?
It's handicapped parking at the damn mall!
What the hell is a camera here for anyway?
I am simply here to illustrate the fact that a traumatic experience, such as the kind that each one of us has been forced to endure, can have a positive outcome. That's all.
Yeah? Like what?
A new perspective on life. Wait, wait, wait.
I know. I understand that you're not at that place yet.
I understand that and I respect that.
But if you look around at all these people taking their lives for granted, eventually they all found something positive from their experience.
We should never be ashamed of what we've gone through, because we are good and we are strong!
You know what?
I'd like everybody to have a look at something right here.
These are my scars.
Because our minds will heal, but these scars will never go away.
These scars should not be a symbol of shame.
They should be worn as a badge of courage.
You know, earlier,
I spoke of valuing your loved ones.
But to be perfectly honest, it's something that I never did prior to my ordeal.
But since then,
I have found someone who has truly become my rock.
Joyce, if you could...
Please.
It's my lovely wife Joyce.
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
Bravo.
To be able to sustain such a traumatic experience, and yet find the positive in that grizzly act, it's a remarkable feat indeed.
Remarkable, if not a little perverse.
I'm sure I speak for everyone here when I say how grateful we are to be part of your promotional DVD.
I appreciate it. Thank you. It's...
- I can take that, sir.
- Thank you very much.
Joyce, can I borrow him for a second?
Sure. I'll be in the car, okay?
Two minutes behind you.
- Great.
- You'll see her to the car, please, sir?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
What's up?
So what's with the creepy guy with the cane? Someone I should know about?
No, no, no. He's been at these meetings longer than I have.
He's fine.
All right.
Listen, get back to the hotel, and get some rest, all right?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Great work tonight, Bobby.
- Thank you.
- You're the man.
Joyce?
What happened to him?
They always tell you not to smoke at the gas station.
- This should wrap up the week for you.
- Great.
What's up, man?
I'm at a junkyard on 58th.
Why?
Call came in about a car crash.
Car crash? Why are you there?
It's not just a car crash.
It's a trap.
How many bodies?
Enough pieces to make four.
Okay, get everyone away from that crime scene till I get there.
- Even Homicide, you got it?
- Yeah.
All right, I'm on the way.
Hello, Evan.
I want to play a game.
The situation you find yourself in...
You, your girlfriend...
You have intimidated others based on their physical differences.
So, what do you think?
Why?
Why this display?
Why them? Why now?
You know he likes to put on a show.
Well, there's gotta be something else.
Bag the other bodies. Get them back to the coroner's office right away.
We'll need them checked for anything resembling a clue.
Tattoos, piercings, skin cuttings.
If that man has a cavity in his tooth,
I want to know about it.
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
Gibson.
Yeah?
Hoffman was expecting you.
God damn.
Would you look at that?
Please get forensics in here.
Tell them to haul ass.
This needs to be dusted for prints.
- All right.
- Okay.
Help!
Hello, Bobby.
I want to play a game.
You have amassed wealth, fame, and notoriety,
based upon your story of survival.
Many have aided in your cause, but few know the truth.
You are a liar.
You and I both know you have never been in a trap,
nor have you ever been tested.
Today these lies will come full circle and you will learn
if you truly have what it takes to call yourself a survivor.
The cage you find yourself in
will symbolize your rebirth.
Joyce? No!
Joyce! No!
Please, no.
Within the next 60 minutes,
you must stay upon the path of learning
and traverse a series of obstacles
to obtain access to your wife,
who you have also deceived.
If you fail to reach her before the clock runs out,
- she will die.
- No.
Live or die, Bobby?
Make your choice.
Bobby!
Help!
Help!
Let me out!
Bobby.
Bobby! What's going on? What's going on?
Another Jigsaw survivor has come forward.
As the city stays crippled in fear from the Jigsaw killings,
chilling new words from the latest survivor provide a reminder
of the physical and mental toll these deadly games can take.
This horrible event was happening to me,
and in that moment,
that moment that this thing
threatened to take everything away,
even the pain,
I realized what I still had left to give.
And I didn't want to let that go.
It gave me light.
That pure moment of absolute horror gave me light.
And as wrong as this may seem,
I'm better for enduring it.
I'm stronger.
And, I must admit, I'm grateful for it.
I'm grateful it happened to me,
and I wish the same for everyone like me.
Joan is but one of a growing number of citizens...
If something like that doesn't get you to change your perspective on life,
I don't know what will.
Yeah.
And if those people weren't so fucked up after their games, they'd make a mint selling their stories.
That's a real clever design.
Yours or your husband's?
- Everything was him.
- Right.
Well, here's my problem, that was left for me, and your fingerprints were all over it.
When you told me Hoffman had it in for you, you didn't mention that it was because you tried to kill him.
There's a new game going on.
Does that surprise you?
- No.
- No? No?
You're crazy, you know that?
I knew you were crazy the minute I laid eyes on you.
Crazy.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do, crazy.
Till I catch Mark Hoffman, this is your new home.
Get comfy.
What makes you think he can't find me here?
Jill, it's a safe house.
Safe house. Safe. House.
You get it?
Gibson, this was sent here addressed to Jill.
Hoffman knows our location.
God damn it. God damn it!
What?
We just had a small explosion here in a car at the crime scene.
Okay, is anyone hurt?
Holy shit!
Rogers?
Rogers, you okay?
Yeah.
Get out of there.
You get the bomb squad to sweep the yard.
Don't touch anything else until it's clean.
- Got it.
- All right.
Play it.
Hello, Gibson.
Been a long time.
What I want is simple,
give me Jill Tuck.
You're protecting her despite the fact
that she had direct knowledge throughout,
which makes her complicit in every death.
I'll make you a deal.
Give her to me,
the game stops, and no one else dies.
If not, everyone dies and you'll be to blame.
Make your choice.
The clock is ticking.
Let's get her down to the holding cell at the station.
Lock it down.
No one gets in without my authority.
Got it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God!
No! Please!
No! Please, help! Please!
Please, no!
God damn it!
Bobby. Bobby, help me!
You've got to get me out of here.
I can't move, Bobby.
Please, help me!
Okay, okay, okay. Just relax.
Ow.
Ow!
Help me! Do something!
Don't leave me.
Hello, Bobby.
Before you is one of your trusted colleagues.
She has been your publicist for years, knowing your lies
but choosing to speak no evil.
She has been richly rewarded for her words,
but today she will be rewarded for her silence.
In the X-ray, you will see a key,
the key to Nina's survival, which will shut off her device.
But there's a catch.
You have one minute to pull the fish hook from her stomach,
and unlock her device
or else the four spikes will penetrate her throat,
- silencing Nina forever.
- Fuck!
Remember, the spikes will also advance
each time the decibel level in this room rises above a whisper,
killing her even sooner.
Will Nina live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.
- Help me. Help!
- No! No!
Just shut up.
Stay with me, okay?
Do it.
No. No. No.
Okay, stay with me. Stay with me.
It's gonna be okay. Look at me.
Look at me.
No! Nina, quiet. Nina.
Please. Please, for me.
Just shut the fuck up.
I'm gonna get this out.
No! No!
Just do it, Bobby. Just fucking do it.
Bobby!
No!
Why wouldn't you just shut the fuck up?
You just needed to shut up!
No! Oh, my God!
No! Help!
Help! Help!
Here you are, ma'am. Take care.
Ma'am, your name?
Sara, without an "H".
I just want to say I love your book so much.
I just felt like I could feel everything that you went through.
I feel like it changed my life.
I appreciate that, ma'am.
I really do. Thank you.
Thank you.
Your name, sir?
John.
With an "H," without an "H," it doesn't matter.
We'll go with John with an "H" this time.
You got quite an army working for you here, don't you?
Must be spreading a pretty good word.
Well, we try to reach as many people as possible, you know?
You don't see anything wrong with that?
No.
No, sir, I don't.
You know, history is a passion for me.
And in ancient Egypt if you were speaking under oath, you were required to say,
"If I'm lying, take me to the quarries."
That mean anything to you?
No, sir. No, sir, it doesn't.
Well, I'll tell you what it means.
It means if you knowingly lied on the public record that you were subject to a period of enslavement.
What are you implying here, sir?
I'm not implying anything.
Move along, buddy. He signed your book.
Thanks for the signature.
Nice picture, but I don't need it.
We've met.
Adam, Gibson says he wants you on these right away.
They're from the junkyard.
Make your choice.
The clock is ticking.
See that?
Yeah.
I know that from somewhere.
Hey, I've got something over here.
We might know who's in the game.
This was just sent to us.
It was taken from a security camera downtown.
The guy's name is Bobby Dagen.
- Familiar?
- No.
He's a Jigsaw survivor who's milking it on talk shows.
His wife and handlers are also missing.
Joyce?
Who is it? Who's there?
- Suzanne.
- Who is that?
For fuck's sake, Bobby. Bobby.
Bobby, get me out of here.
Bobby, help me.
- Is Cale here?
- Who the fuck knows?
Get this off of me, Bobby!
Get this off of me!
Hello, Bobby.
That feeling running through your body is fear,
the fear of not knowing if you have what it takes to survive.
Before you is your lawyer
who swore an oath of ethics,
but chose to see no evil in order to benefit herself.
Once her device begins to rotate,
it will pierce her eyes and mouth
if you don't delay its movement for at least 30 seconds.
To do this,
you must step into the other machine and lift the bars to the highest position
long enough to close the circuit, slowing down her device.
If you do nothing, she will wind to her death
before the clock runs out.
Do you have what it takes to help her?
Make your choice.
Bobby, please!
Bobby, please get me out!
Get me the fuck...
Oh, God!
No, no! Bobby, please!
Please, help me!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Please, hurry! Hurry!
Come on, Bobby, please! Hurry!
Come on! Bobby, come on!
Hurry! Please! Please, hurry!
Bobby, please, hurry!
Hurry!
Yes! Yes, Bobby! Yes!
Come on!
Bobby, no.
No! God, no!
No! Bobby!
Please, no! Bobby, no!
Come on, Bobby. Please!
Get me out of here!
Come on!
Bobby, please!
No!
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. Bobby, stay there.
Bobby, please, no!
No! No!
No!
Please, please!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, my God.
No. No.
Help!
Do you know this guy?
I've seen him on TV, but I don't know him.
Did your husband?
I don't know.
You sure you don't know him?
Yeah, I'm sure.
All right then.
Lock it up.
Hoffman just sent an e-mail with an MPEG attachment.
I'm just searching the IP address.
Can you find out where it came from?
It depends on how many proxy servers he filtered it through, but it was time-delayed, so it'll leave fingerprints.
Play it.
Hello, Gibson.
Once again, we're at a moral crossroad.
I don't blame you for not giving me Jill Tuck,
but you shouldn't let an old grudge cloud your judgment.
Look to where you're being led.
Look beyond the crossroad to the clear dawn.
Do you see it?
I get it. Let's go.
Joyce?
Cale?
Bobby? Bobby?
Listen to me. Cale.
Cale, I can see you, okay?
- Cale, don't move.
- Bobby, where the hell are you?
- You got to help me, Bobby.
- Do you know where Joyce is?
What the fuck? I can't see, man.
How the fuck would I know where Joyce is?
I'm about to lose my shit!
Do I know where Joyce is?
I'm fucking blind, man.
Okay, Cale. Cale, do not move.
I got this thing around my fucking neck.
I can't fucking breathe.
Don't fucking move.
We're not on the ground floor.
A lot of this floor is missing.
Just don't move, okay?
Fuck. You gotta help me.
Get me fucking down, Bobby! Fuck!
Fuck me!
Cale, there's a tape.
- What fucking tape?
- There's a tape.
Shut up. I'm gonna play the tape.
Hello, Bobby.
Across from you is your closest friend.
He knows all your sins, yet he acts as though he hears no evil.
Today, what he hears
will be the difference between life and death.
Bobby, you must help
Cale walk over the planks,
and get as close to you as possible.
Find your own way across the beams to the key.
You must get it to him over the last span between you.
If the noose around Cale's neck is not removed within 60 seconds,
a winch will be engaged, and your secret will be left hanging.
Does Cale live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.
Bobby!
Oh, God.
Cale. Cale, listen to me.
Listen to me.
Shut the fuck up and you listen to me for once.
Listen, I'm gonna walk you through this, okay, buddy?
I'm blind. You fucking come to me.
I'm gonna try to get as close to you as I can, buddy.
I'm fucking listening to you.
Talk me fucking through this.
I want you to shuffle to your right.
Just shuffle exactly to your right.
You're gonna feel a plank at your foot.
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes, perfect.
I need you to head out on that plank.
- Oh, fuck.
- Yes.
Okay, I got it. I got it. I got it!
Fuck this.
Okay, Cale, I'm on the way.
Fuck. Fuck. Okay, all right.
Now there's gonna be a plank in front of you.
- Okay.
- You're gonna have to go about 10 degrees to your right.
I got it. I got it.
- Come on, keep fucking talking to me.
- Okay. Okay, Cale.
- Feel where the plank...
- I got it.
Okay.
Oh, God! What the fuck was that, man?
It's okay, Cale. It was a bottle.
It was a bottle.
- What the fuck was that?
- It's okay. It was a bottle.
- You're gonna be fine.
- Okay.
Fuck. Okay.
You got it, buddy.
You got it.
Now you're gonna feel a second plank.
- You'll feel it with your foot.
- I got it.
Feel it with your foot.
Get me out of this fucking thing, Bobby.
Step up onto the plank.
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.
Relax. You're okay.
No! No!
Cale, hang on. Cale.
Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck.
Bobby. Bobby.
I got the key but... Cale!
I'm gonna throw you the key.
Cup your hands closer to your chest!
I'm gonna throw it on three, all right?
One, two, three.
No.
Oh, fuck me.
No! God damn it, no!
Cale!
No. Cale.
There's nothing here.
Yes, there is.
Right there.
Why would he want us to come here?
For me to remember.
This is where he saved my life.
When I was in uniform
I responded to a distress call here.
Back when this place was a flophouse for junkies and homeless people.
Freeze! Don't you fucking move.
Drop the gun.
He didn't know what hit him.
Yeah, he assaulted me, but it shouldn't have been a death sentence.
Next time, you shoot first.
I had no choice but to report Hoffman for brutality.
You owe me.
What happened?
He got a promotion is what happened.
And I got put on an island.
A year later, I transferred to IA, busted three of his guys.
He swore he'd get me back, and here we are.
This place was called
Crossroads Manufacturing before it closed.
"Look beyond the crossroads
"to the clear dawn."
I don't follow you.
The man he killed was released from
Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital when the state shut it down.
That building's been abandoned for years.
That's where the game is being played.
All right, you get back, you stay with Jill Tuck.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Bobby!
- Joyce?
- Bobby. Bobby!
Bobby, I'm here.
- Joyce.
- Bobby, can you hear me?
Joyce, I can hear you. I can see you.
Bobby, I can see you, too.
Yes, baby.
- Get me out of here.
- Baby, I'm on my way.
Who's doing this? Why?
- Why is this happening?
- Please, baby, I'm on the way.
- Just hang on, okay?
- Hurry. Please hurry.
There's got to be a tape.
Hello, Bobby.
Before you is the door that leads to your wife.
However, you must first make a choice.
As you may have guessed, your decision will be as difficult as pulling teeth.
The lock before you requires a four-digit combination to open.
However, if it is access you seek
then a true sacrifice will have to be made.
Watch and learn, Bobby.
The necessary numbers have been etched onto two of your teeth.
Look to the chart as a reference for which teeth to pull
and in which order to enter the digits.
Time is ticking down.
You must make your decision quickly.
Bobby!
I don't want you to see this, baby, okay?
Oh, my God.
No.
No!
Left side clear.
Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Change your position.
The game's still on.
- Let's go.
- Move to the second level.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Clear.
Go.
- Clear up.
- All clear.
Move, move.
- Moving in.
- Moving in.
- Clear.
- We're clear.
Block it off.
- What?
- I found where that MPEG came from.
- Where?
- A business called Pete's Auto Body on 58th Street.
- The junkyard.
- The location of the car trap?
Yeah, that's correct.
Okay, you guys keep moving.
Where are you going?
To get Hoffman.
Okay, let's move it.
Rogers.
Yeah.
What? What happened?
Gibson's got Hoffman's location.
The game isn't over.
Another body.
Hold.
We got a live one.
Can't cross here. Let's go.
Hey. Go get your shotguns.
You come follow me.
Give me your gun.
Hoffman, freeze.
I want you to slowly put your hands in the air.
Joyce.
Bobby.
Bobby, I knew you'd make it.
I knew you'd find me.
I am so sorry.
I knew you could do it.
I knew you'd come.
Get me out.
Bobby. Oh, my God.
There's gotta be another way.
Hello, Bobby.
You have almost completed your rebirth.
However, your final task will be your most difficult.
The woman before you symbolizes your success.
She is your trophy.
And she has seen the good in your message,
despite its dishonest beginnings.
What's he talking about?
Today, we will see if you can truly earn her love.
To prove your status as a survivor,
you must overcome a game that should be all too familiar.
- No.
- You supposedly survived it once already,
so it should be easy to survive once again.
Pierce the hooks through your chest muscles,
and the game will begin.
In order to free yourself and your wife, you must hoist yourself with these chains,
and connect the extension cords above you before the clock expires.
Both hands will be needed to complete this task.
But that should be simple.
For, as you claim to understand,
the pectoral muscles can easily support your weight.
So I ask you, Bobby,
when you embrace every day as if it is your last,
will it be with your wife?
Make your choice.
What's he talking about?
Baby, I'm so sorry.
I lied.
I was never in a trap.
Clear.
How could you let me believe that?
I'm gonna make this right.
You don't deserve to be there.
I'm your wife.
How could you lie to me?
I know that from somewhere.
Make your choice. Clock's ticking.
Bag the other bodies. Get them back to the coroner's office right away.
What is this, sir?
Hoffman tapped into the station's security system.
He's been watching us the whole time.
Oh, my God.
- This is Palmer.
- Listen.
You get every available officer back to the station.
I'm sorry, sir?
Right now.
Sir.
Gibson, are you still there? Gibson.
- Door's locked!
- We're locked in!
Gas! Gas!
Look for an exit.
I love you, Joyce.
I never lied about that.
I love you. I love you.
Bobby, I love you.
No! Oh, my God.
No.
No.
Gibson.
You can do it.
You can do it.
Oh, my God.
Bobby, I love you.
You can do it.
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
Pull. Pull, Bobby. I know you can do it.
Pull.
Oh, my God. Keep going.
Bobby, you can do it. Oh, my God.
Bobby!
Pull!
What was that?
That's it, pull. Pull!
Pull.
Hurry!
Pull. You're almost there.
Fight, Bobby. You can do it.
Someone's out there.
Oh, my God. No!
Help me! Help me!
Help me! No!
I've been looking for you.
How do I look?
Bitch.
Help me!
Bobby, please, reach.
Go.
Bobby, reach.
Hurry.
Reach. Reach!
You can do it, Bobby.
Bobby, reach. Reach.
One more. Reach. You can do it. Bobby!
Bobby, you can do it.
Bobby!
No!
Bobby!
No. Bobby!
Joyce!
Bobby!
Joyce!
Bobby! Bobby!
Joyce! Joyce!
Bobby!
You fucking cunt.
No! Bobby!
Joyce!
No!
Bobby!
Joyce!
Game over.
Over the last two hours,
it seems our entire city has been shaken to its core.
In addition to the nine police employees killed tonight,
Jill Tuck, the wife of serial killer
John Kramer, has been found dead.
Citizens are being advised to report any activity,
even remotely suspicious, at this time,
as blockades are being set up at major intersections
within a 30-mile radius,
surrounding what will be considered the largest attack
on this city's police department in our history.
Any citizens with information leading to the apprehension...
What the fuck?
Hello, Dr. Gordon.
You are perhaps my greatest asset.
Congratulations, Dr. Gordon.
You survived.
Without you, my work over the last few years would not have been possible.
Jeff's wife.
Dr. Lynn Denlon.
She'll be perfect.
My eyes! I can't see!
That having been said,
I have a request.
Watch over Jill.
And should anything happen to her,
I want you to act immediately on my behalf.
In return for that,
I will keep no more secrets from you.
I've shown you a lot of places.
But there is one that will be, perhaps, the most meaningful to you.
I don't think so.
What do you think you're doing?
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
No!
You can't fucking do this to me.
Fuck you. No!
Game over.
No!
The story of the week
Oh...
Here it goes
5 years ago, when I was 21...
Becoming a vegetarian was a major trend.
So I went on a vegetarian camp for four days
As soon as we arrived, we took a walk.
The guide pointed to a clover and said...
'We can eat this' and ate it
Then a few people tried it.
It tasted strange and bitter...
But we thought it was a good experience...
But they wouldn't give us any food.
When we asked at night why there's no food...
He said, "Didn't you eat the plants during the walk?"
- Who? Who?
- What!
The darn guide said!
"Didn't you eat the grass on our walk?"
Let go!
Co-producer Seok-bin JANG
Help me!
BEDEVILLED
How many times did I tell you?
Low-income families can get up to $30,000.
But you have no income, so the maximum is $20,000
But you said I could I already moved.
That was the maximum.
Anyway, we can't lend you $30,000 so borrow it from someone.
If I could, why would I ask for a loan?
Then move to a different place.
But I paid the deposit and moved my stuff in!
So, try borrowing from someone else.
Who'd lend money to a single, old woman!
You should've made sure before signing the lease
But you said I could have the money!
I never said that!
Ma'am
Hello? Stop calling, please
I'll be out for a sec
If the manager asks for me...
Please leave now, ma'am
Next Counter Please.
I'm working.
Sorry, but you're always so busy
And you never write back
Can't you come for a visit?
I got to go.
They can't see me for sure?
Of course Strictly confidential.
They look about right.
You're right...
Excuse me?
The victim's friends saw them bothering her at a nightclub.
Isn't that all you need?
But they didn't witness the assault
That's why we need your statement
But, I didn't get a good look at their faces...
Just try to remember.
It's them, but we have no proof.
Sergeant Choi!
Sorry, ma'am.
- He doesn't have the ring.
- A ring?
Yes One of them had a ring with a skull on it.
The doctor said it looked like a ring, too.
But it's hard to tell the shape on multiple wounds.
Don't contact me anymore.
- But if you remember...
- Then I'll call you.
But unlikely!
You bastards! Why won't you admit it!
You did it!
I'll kill all you bastards!
- Please tell me everything!
- Please!
You said you saw them...
Please tell me everything! You saw them!
You saw them! Please, say what happened!
You saw them! Please!
Let's not meet again
I got real scary buddies...
Fucking up a bitch is nothing
- Did they say anything to you?
- No
Would you like to go inside and talk?
No
- You're back
- She's still here?
Everything's set.
Have your landlord sign this.
Thank you very much! Thank you so much.
Thank you!
What happened?
- What did you tell the manager?
- I didn't say anything about you
Ji-soo, you talk as if I made a mistake.
Of course not I just felt so bad for her.
Are you close with the manager?
Or close with all your male superiors?
Be careful!
There's a limit to how far a flirt can go in the financial world
Ji-soo...
I'm really sorry. A drink tonight?
Ok, let's make up. Where to?
Hello?
Hello!
How about...
Ms CHUNG!
Get out!
Take a vacation
Who is it?
- Who is it?
- The superintendent.
- I don't recognize your voice.
- I'm a superintendent.
What is it?
Your mailbox is way overloaded
On vacation
Up until 10 years ago, boats went in twice a day
Now there are only 9 people left.
Who are you visiting on Moo-do Island?
My grandfather used to live there.
- What was his name?
- Suk-hwan KIM.
I knew it! You're Hae-won, right?
I thought it was you!
Remember me? Of Course you don't.
You were so pretty back then...
Still damn pretty!
You married?
Of course you are! I'm not.
Hurry! Hurry!
- You're Hae-won, right?
- Yes.
Really Hae-won?
Don't touch her with those dirty hands.
Sorry
- You're really Hae-won, right?
- Yes, I'm really Hae-won.
It's you! Hae-won!
Well, I'm off
She's here
Who? Kim's granddaughter?
You're Hae-won?
It's you alright You haven't changed a bit.
Remember us?
So pretty and white Is it from drinking
Seoul's water?
- That's right.
- Of course.
That's my hubby Remember? Man-jong.
That's his brother, Chul-jong
Man-jong and Chul-jong.
Oh please Don't call them by their names like that.
Why'd you come here on vacation?
There's nothing here...
City folks like to come for... fresh Air and water on vacations.
This is no tourist attraction!
- When are you going back?
- I'm staying for about a week.
You'll change your mind in a day.
Back to work If it rains, the potatoes will rot.
Aren't you coming?
Bok-nam, come and help out.
After I take Hae-won to her house.
What's Chul-jong and that old man chewing on?
Don't know?
It's called bozo leaf because you become a bozo chewing on it.
Here.
It's hot, isn't it?
Remember? We wrote that there.
Your grandpa got mad like hell.
Mama?
Go on Say hello to mama's friend.
Come here What's your name?
Yeon-hee don't know how to act around others.
What grade is she in?
She's 10, but she doesn't go to school.
I want to send her.
But Man-jong and his aunt don't think girls need schooling.
Said, if she gets educated, she'll run away from us.
Who doesn't send kids to elementary school these days?
They even send kids to study abroad in kindergarten.
Really?
I hope I can send her to school next year.
She goes to the school to read books these days.
So I was wondering...
It's been 15 years since grandpa passed away.
How's this place so clean?
Take a guess
I spent three whole days cleaning this place.
Thanks you were saying?
Huh?
You were going to say something about Yeon-hee?
It's nothing You just got here
You must be starving I'll go get some food.
I'm going night fishing with Yeon-hee.
- Really?
- Yup.
You always come back empty-handed.
You love going fishing with papa?
- Lazy-head not sleeping?
- You're back?
Was it fun? Did you catch anything?
How can an islander be so bad at fishing?
You caught no fish for over 2 weeks.
Why, so you can pig out if I do catch them?
Not only me Yeon-hee, you, and that brother of yours.
Didn't I tell you to show respect talking about me and my family?
Even dogs and pigs learn if they get beaten Why not you!
You a dog? Don't eat on the floor.
This is why you need a man around.
Even a dozen women Can't do that.
Damn right
Nephew? Can you fix our shed after this?
Sure.
- How about our door?
- Sure.
Do it yourself.
My nephew's dying doing all the work.
Damn right
He can't die Without him, we're all dead.
Damn right!
What you doing?
Don't just sit there Make some noodles.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Finish that up, first.
Yes, ma'am
Let her rest, she must be tired.
It's nothing compared to men's work.
What's Kim's granddaughter up to?
Still sleeping!
Damn woman still in bed in broad daylight.
Seoul life must be really hard.
A woman's most happy with a dick in her mouth.
Still not married and taking vacation?
Stupid little girl
There's lots of women in Seoul who aren't married.
So?
You've been yapping about
Seoul a lot these days.
- It's so good.
- Here, have some more.
All this trouble for me I'll cook for myself now.
It's no trouble.
Want to go and take a bath in the pond?
The pond?
Remember where we used to go when we were little?
No one will look
People here all sleep after sundown.
I'll go first to do some laundry Hurry up.
- Give me your laundry, too.
- It's okay I'll do it...
With these hands?
No laundry rooms here, right?
Seoul people do laundry in rooms?
How strange!
Bok-nam!
This island has a lot of fresh water.
We even had rice farms in the past.
So clean and white.
So smooth and slippery.
Remember we used to bathe here at nights when we were kids?
Yeah, the water was nice and cool.
What are you doing!
Oh, come on It's just me.
Just scared me, that's all.
About what?
Nothing.
Bet you got men lined up like flies on a corpse, huh?
Phones should work since they set a base station or something up there.
But who knows?
The only phone here is the one at Auntie's house.
What are you doing, Uncle?
You like flowers?
What are you doing, mama's friend?
Mama's friend? Just call me auntie...
Auntie?
That's better Want me to read it to you?
Fold them for me.
Your mom will be upset if you fold up your textbooks.
Mama gave them to me to fold them.
What?
All except this one Social Studies.
- Why not?
- Because it talks about Seoul here.
I want to get holes in my ears like you.
Why you!
I wish my boobs will grow big like yours soon.
Scream! Scream bitch!
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.
She's here again?
I said scream!
What's going on?
Nothing Just fooling around Watch Yeon- hee for me?
Stay at auntie's house.
Hold hands.
Go on.
Tell her to sell our honey, too.
Yes, ma'am.
How can you eat listening to that?
When another bitch is sucking on your hubby's dick.
Look at you You're eating like a damn pig.
I'm sorry.
You're really tanned Put this on your face It's sunscreen.
Don't need your pity.
I didn't want to come, but he paid my boss three times the rate.
I'm sorry Really.
Why are you sorry? You aren't the monster.
You'll ruin your body like that.
I know that.
What the...
How can you live with him? I'd run away.
Probably kill me if I tried again.
Where'd you run away to?
Should've gone to Seoul
No one can find you there
Don't even need this. Seoul water will make you white.
Then why you living like that?
Want to run away together?
We'll go to Seoul and work at restaurants or something.
But a kid needs her father
Who needs that?
I grew up fine without a dad.
Oh, right Real fine.
Aren't you fixing dinner?
Hey!
Dumb bitch.
- What?
- Get the rest of the honey.
The boat's coming in tomorrow
- After I cool off the stings.
- Why you little!
Put bean paste on it
- What the hell you up to?
- Stop cursing.
What's with your face?
Just stung by bees.
You let your husband get away with that?
It's just a couple of stings.
Not that...
Right in front of you!
He had sex with a girl in your room. and you act like it's nothing?
We keep things to ourselves here.
Not like you're going to take me in.
You need someone to take care of you?
You're an adult
You should take care of yourself.
- Come on.
- It's hard.
Not too close!
5 minutes No, just for 1 minute, please.
My baby girl's home Let's go take a bath.
What are you doing?
I want to be loved by papa, too.
You said to try to get loved by papa.
That isn't what I was talking about.
Where'd you get this? Did you steal it from that girl?
No!
- Then where?
- Gave it to me.
The girl gave it to you?
Answer me! Want me to beat it out of you!
Papa gave it to me!
Why would he give this to you?
What about these bunny undies?
Why's the laundry on the ground?
Did you fight? Over this?
Damn girls.
Put it on All over your body, bitch!
Don't get jealous of the kid!
Let's just give it to your mama.
I'll get you something better.
Take it and scram! Get the hell out of my sight.
You've been laid off as per the
Employment Law.
Manager!
The caller you have reached is...
Oh, hi
I'm leaving on the next boat. I had a good rest thanks to you.
I'm going be a new me when I get back to Seoul.
Though it won't be easy to change all of a sudden.
Thank you for everything.
Can I come by often?
What's this? Blood?
It's not blood.
Why's this on your face?
- Hae-won...
- What's with you?
- Hae-won...
- What?
Can't you take Yeon-hee and me with you to Seoul?
You can go anywhere you want.
But I don't know how to live on the mainland.
It's the same Seoul is scarier to live in then here.
- You said you'd take me.
- When? 15 years ago?
Yeah Don't that count as a promise?
Next time After I take care of something first.
Next time, again?
Fine Then just take Yeon-hee? Please?
Why Yeon-hee?
Don't ask why.
Please, I'm begging you...
If you take her, I won't call or write you no more.
Oh, come on!
Just tell me If you don't, I'm not taking her.
I think Man-jong... must have screwed...
Yeon-hee
That makes no sense.
What?
I know you want to go to Seoul...
But still, how can you say something like that?
Try a more believable lie next time!
You think I'm lying?
You know what the bastards are like!
I don't know anything!
Reading?
Why do you want your boobs to grow?
Don't you know? That's how girls are loved.
Yeon-hee... Does daddy love you?
How does daddy love you?
What you doing here?
Yeon-hee, come here.
You're old enough to earn your keep.
Stop idling around.
- Take her and feed her.
- Sure thing.
- But I need that book.
- Let's just go and eat.
- You should take the next boat.
- There's something...
Laws are meant to change according to circumstances.
And Bok-nam's damn good at lying.
She grew up like a beggar.
She'll beg like a dog to get anything.
Then let the police investigate.
If you're so sure, why don't you report it?
You know that Yeon-hee is not
Man-jong's real daughter?
What?
If you're not going to protect this island, stop worrying and go.
Mi-ran? It's me
It's Moo-do Island
Remember what you said before?
About going to Seoul?
- Mom!
- Quiet!
- Where are we going? I'm sleepy.
- We running away...
- Where?
- To the mainland
Papa said the mainland's trouble
- You can go to school there.
- I don't want to go to school!
Then fine Just go where papa isn't!
But I like papa I like it here!
So you don't want to go?
- If I don't, you're not going either?
- Of course not.
If we don't go now, you'll get beat all your life?
Then I'll go with you mama
Because I can't stand you getting beat.
Let's go The boat's coming.
That hurts Not so hard.
- You crying, mama?
- Never saw mama cry, huh?
No, I heard you cry and say you'd rather die than live like this.
- What's good about dying?
- I'm sorry. You're right.
Rolling in dung is better than dying.
I don't want to roll in dung!
I warned you, not him!
No one else would come here at this hour.
Still, not him You stupid!
Don't worry I don't care for people's business.
Just pay me enough for the boat
Where'd you get this?
Oh no! Look!
Mama! Hurry! Hurry! Come on!
Let's go now! Man-jong's coming!
Hurry!
Please hurry! He's coming!
I got to count it! Shit, I lost my count!
Let's go!
- Hurry!
- Let me count first!
Where's my damn lighter?
Got a light?
- Hurry!
- Hurry up!
We'll go when I'm done counting
One, two, three...
Sis! Sis!
Sis!
Papa!
- Papa!
- Come here, you bitch!
I take in a bitch with a kid! And you sneak off on me! You bitch!
You bitch!
Don't just stand there! Stop him!
Break her damn legs!
Like dogs and bitches who try to run away... Break them so she can't go!
Get up!
Stop your brother She's going to die!
Papa!
Get up!
Dumb fucking whore!
Warned you to stay away from people's business!
Stop it, papa!
I'll live with you! Stop hitting her!
I treated you good! And you betray your papa?
Is it because I'm not your real dad?
I'll show you how papa can get real mad!
Are you okay!
Stop it! Not Yeon-hee.
Careful, Man-jong!
Are you crazy?
You can't throw stones at your husband!
A woman can get stoned to death but not a man?
He took you and your kid in!
You should be grateful, bitch!
- Damn right!
- Of course!
Quit saying that!
Why don't I know who the father is?
I was raped by more than one bastard!
- By every single one of them!
- Shut up! You filthy bitch!
- Damn bitch!
- Papa!
You damn bitch!
Yeon-hee? Wake up, Yeon-hee!
- Get some water Hurry!
- Yes, sis.
Yeon-hee...
Yeon-hee...
Yeon-hee... Wake up
Let's go to Seoul...
Yeon-hee...
Stop fussing bitch She'll be fine with some bean paste Move!
Let go!
Don't touch her! Let go!
Get away!
Get away!
Thanks for coming all this way.
Must be hard taking care of the elders.
Why'd your aunt call me out here?
How's your father doing?
He said to say hello when I said I'm coming here.
If you told me before, I would've called a doctor.
You need a medical report to file a death these days.
She just slipped and fell Makes no differece if a doctor sees her.
Actually, I can draw up the report myself.
I'm Yeon-hee's grandma.
If you look at it, I'm her grandma, too.
How would I look if you are suspicious of her death.
- But her bruises are...
- Bok-nam? Why don't you tell him?
If we were lying, would her mama stay still?
She's quiet Then, did she kill the kid?
What did you say?
Move for a sec.
What did you just say?
That bastard killed her He kicked her.
She fell...
I wasn't going to say this but...
If you're going to blame me,
I have no choice.
This bitch here tried to pack up and run away this morning.
- Isn't that right?
- Huh? Yes, sir.
Were you there too, when she died?
- You don't believe me?
- Go on I'm listening.
I knew she was going to run away But she tried to take Yeon-hee, too
I couldn't let that happen
So, I told her to leave the kid and go if she wants.
- I even gave her some money.
- Yeah right!
You never gave me a dime all these years!
Then where's that money from?
I stole it. From that bastard's pocket.
Boast why don't you? Damn thief!
Our nephew's trying to cover up that run-away bitch's sins.
- He's got a good heart.
- Good heart my ass!
- Watch your fucking language.
- Man-jong...
It's money I made from the honey, anyways!
Fine... I'm sorry for not providing you with much.
There's not much here for her.
So I told her to go and start a new life
But...
- But the kid... Not her!
- Man-jong.
Let the kid decide
So? What did she say?
A child would normally follow the mother.
But her mama was so mean, the kid chose the stepfather.
She held my ankle tight and begged to stay.
But she pulled her away!
And fell down Then bumped her head on a rock.
God damn it.
Bok-nam? Is that right?
Then what about Bok-nam's friend?
Did you see the child die?
No I was sleeping at the time.
Good work.
The honey's for you in the mornings.
A big spoonful when you wake up
I should save good honey like this
Wait Bok-nam's friend said she's going back, too.
Don't worry. You're busy. Go on!
Get the stuff on the boat.
- No, I'll carry them.
- It's okay!
- What's this?
- Boat fare It's not much.
Wait! Wait up!
She got something to say to him?
What's her hurry?
No need to hurry A boat will come tomorrow.
No more buses to Seoul today.
Damn right!
Bok-nam must be sad
Shouldn't you console her?
Damn right She could use a friend now.
Tell Bok-nam thanks
Seoul girls won't stand you messing with them...
Especially with a witness.
- Isn't it dirty?
- Nope!
You're laughing?
Let go!
Man-jong! Get her!
Stupid Dumb bastards.
Boat's in.
Don't slack off and dig up potatoes before it rains!
Damn bitch Building a grave in the yard.
Scram!
Or I'll bury you right next to that!
Chul-jong! Let's go!
Excited to go into town, Chul-jong?
Move your scrawny ass.
Come you all and have a drink...
So damn heavy Damn it.
This is why we need a man around.
They'll be back tomorrow.
Stop trembling.
Bok-nam, take a break will you?
Sis?
Don't she look a bit crazy? Sis?
Strange if she weren't after losing her kid.
Let her rest for a bit.
She'd go crazy doing nothing! over it faster this way.
I'm doing her good...
- I'll go get some fish.
- Really, sis?
- Don't Get all excited...
- Okay, okay!
Damn bitch isn't worth shit.
How about a song?
Oh time, do not come or go.
My precious youth is gone I'm all old
Ari-ari-rang, Ssuri-Ssurirang,
Arari-ga nat-nae.
Ari-rang Arari-ga nat-nae.
Were you born a beauty?
I was born an ugly.
Ari-ari-rang, Ssuri-Ssurirang,
Arari-ga nat-nae.
Ari-rang!
I stared at the sun for long and it spoke to me.
Said, if I hold back, I'll get sick!
Say something!
What's going on!
She's... she's gone crazy!
We need a man... at a time like this.
The boat's coming soon The men will be back.
I just have to hang on till then.
Auntie! Slow down! You're going to fall!
Damn whore!
Damn you! Damn whore!
Stop it, now! You've done enough!
Damn bitch You're dead now.
The men are back!
I came to this island when I was 15.
I swam for over 50 years!
You! Stay right here
I'm coming back with the men!
- Did you hear something?
- Hear what?
Nothing!
Go check the hives
See if they're okay from the rain.
Damn stupid wife probably left them out in the rain.
- Want to stay for a drink?
- Sure!
Damn it, Auntie...
Should've worn glasses
Why were all these potatoes left in the rain?
Where the hell is everyone?
Damn What's that stench?
Out of Service...
Hey, gramps! Everything okay?
Says everything's fine
That man's living long...
Remember when all
Remember when all the men died in the storm. except him?
All the women beat him. saying he killed their husbands...
Then they all took turns taking him home and feeding him.
All except my mama that is.
Your mom took him up the hill instead of your home.
Where the fuck is everyone?
- Watch your Damn language.
- Sorry!
Dumbass!
Respect your elder first Stupid bastard.
I said, give me some water!
Watch out!
What the hell?
You crazy bitch!
You crazy bitch!
Should tend to the funeral offerings...
Why'd you kill them! Crazy bitch! Why! Why!
Why didn't you just kill yourself!
I didn't want to die.
Then I should live it up.
You never opened up to me.
Treated me like trash
Always cold like a rock to me!
That's why my dick never got hard in front of you.
Is that why you touched my kid? Huh?
Shut your damn mouth!
If the cops get me, I'll tell them everything you did.
Fine.
Killing you is self defense.
If you kill her, I'll call the cops.
I'll kill you painlessly like a pig.
What about her?
Make it look like you killed her?
Or take her as my new wife?
What?
Why? Looks like the killer is scared to die.
What would I be scared of?
- I'm just sorry for you, honey.
- Honey? Crazy bitch.
Does it hurt?
A lot?
Hold on I'll put bean paste on it
Doesn't hurt now, does it! Doesn't hurt now! You bastard!
You damn son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

Where you headed?
Thinking of going to see Seoul...
How long since you been on land?

Damn, didn't you go crazy being stuck there all your life?
Do I look sane to you?

In the village... if someone would stop working...
Auntie used to say...
'That's like Bok-nam... not picking out the weeds'
I... can't stand that anymore.
I wandered today to the hill, Maggie...
To watch the scene below The creek and the rusty old mill.
Please have a seat.
It was them.
